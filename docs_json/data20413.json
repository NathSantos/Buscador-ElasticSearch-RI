Fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica e eventos de ades\u00e3o celular em Anemia \nFalciforme e em Esferocitose Heredit\u00e1ria. 2018. Tese (Doutorado). Faculdade de \nMedicina de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O: As Anemias Hemol\u00edticas compreendem um grupo de doen\u00e7as em \nque h\u00e1 redu\u00e7\u00e3o acentuada na sobreviv\u00eancia dos gl\u00f3bulos vermelhos circulantes e a \nmedula \u00f3ssea n\u00e3o \u00e9 capaz de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o, mesmo aumentando sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o, o \nque causa anemia desde os primeiros anos da vida da pessoa. Dentre as doen\u00e7as \ndeste grupo, a Anemia Falciforme (SCA) e a Esferocitose Heredit\u00e1ria (HS) destacam-\nse por se tratarem de enfermidades com defeitos gen\u00e9ticos intr\u00ednsecos das c\u00e9lulas \nvermelhas (RBCs) que geram complica\u00e7\u00f5es multissist\u00eamicas agudas e cr\u00f4nicas em \nseus portadores. Por vias patofisiol\u00f3gicas distintas, reticul\u00f3citos e respectivas \nhem\u00e1cias defeituosas de tais doen\u00e7as, falciformes e esfer\u00f3citos, s\u00e3o continuamente \naprisionados e fagocitados no ba\u00e7o, importante \u00f3rg\u00e3o de destrui\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e9lulas velhas \ne/ou defeituosas via hem\u00f3lise extravascular, o que leva progressivamente \u00e0 disfun\u00e7\u00e3o \ne eventual perda da fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica. OBJETIVO: Avaliar o papel do ba\u00e7o em \nrela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 habilidade e ao fen\u00f3tipo adesivos de reticul\u00f3citos (ret) e eritr\u00f3citos (erit) em \npacientes com SCA e HS, com e sem fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica preservada. METODOLOGIA: \nAmostras de sangue de 37 pacientes (22 SCA and 15 HS) com fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica e \n19 pacientes (13 SCA e 6 HS) sem ela foram avaliadas. Ainda, sangue de 22 crian\u00e7as \ncom SCA foi coletado em estudo longitudinal dos 6 e 29 meses de vida. Todas as \namostras de sangue foram analisadas quanto \u00e0 fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica (Contagem de \nc\u00e9lulas PIT e de corp\u00fasculos de Howell-Jolly - HJB), quanto ao perfil imunofenot\u00edpico \ncelular (em % e em m\u00e9dia de intensidade de fluoresc\u00eancia - MFI) e quanto \u00e0 \nhabilidade de ades\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas vermelhas \u00e0 laminina e \u00e0 linhagem celular endotelial \nHMEC-1. RESULTADOS: A an\u00e1lise da transi\u00e7\u00e3o da perda de fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica \ndemonstrou que a mesma se intensificou a partir dos 3 anos de idade (PIT: r=0,8; \np<0,0001; HJB: r=0,7; p<0.0001). Quanto \u00e0 imunofenotipagem celular, a contagem \nPIT se correlacionou positivamente, principalmente com os marcadores CD147 \n(%ret: r=0,6; p<0,0001; MFIret: r=0,6; p<0,0001; %erit: r=0,7; p<0,0001; MFIerit: \nr=0,6; p<0,0001), LuBCAM (%ret: r=0,5; p=0,004; MFIret: r=0,6; p<0,0001; %erit: \nr=0,6; p<0,0003; MFIerit: r=0,4; p<0,004) and CD58 (%ret: r=0,4; p=0,006; MFIret: \nr=0,5; p<0,0013; %erit: r=0,4; p<0,009; MFIerit: r=0,6; p<0,0001). Na compara\u00e7\u00e3o \nimunofenot\u00edpica entre aus\u00eancia ou presen\u00e7a do ba\u00e7o, a perda de sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o exerceu \ninflu\u00eancia no aumento da express\u00e3o de ades\u00e3o de RBCs em SCA, principalmente \nCD147 (%ret: p=0,002; MFIret: p=0,003; %erit: p<0,0001; MFIerit: p=0,005), \nLuBCAM (%ret: p=0,0001; MFIret: p<0,0001; %erit: p<0,0001; MFIerit: p<0,0001) e \nCD58 (%ret: p=0,007; MFIret: p=0,006; %erit: p=0,003; MFIerit: p=0,0004), embora \na ades\u00e3o celular tenha diminu\u00eddo em pacientes HS esplenectomizados. Na \ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o entre as doen\u00e7as, pacientes HS com o ba\u00e7o apresentaram maior \nfreq\u00fc\u00eancia de ades\u00e3o celular em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos SCA, notavelmente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao \nLuBCAM (%ret: p=0,0008; MFIret: p=0,03; %erit: p<0,0001; MFIerit: p=0,0002), \nCD58 (%ret: p=0,0009; %erit: p=0,003) e CD44 (%ret: p=0,009; %erit: p<0,003). No \nentanto, as amostras SCA sem fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica tiveram maior express\u00e3o de ades\u00e3o \ncelular para CD147 (%ret: p=0,006; MFIret: p=0,02; %erit: p=0,02), LuBCAM (%ret: \np=0,004; MFIret: p<0,0001), CD36 (%ret: p=0,0002; MFIret: p=0,01), CD242 (%ret: \np=0,0008; %erit: p=0,05) e CD49d (%ret: p=0,04). Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Ensaio de Ades\u00e3o \nin vitro, na aus\u00eancia de ba\u00e7o, os RBCs SCA apresentaram maior adesividade \u00e0 \n\n\n\nlaminina do que os RBCs SCA com fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica preservada em todas as taxas \nde fluxo de tens\u00e3o de cisalhamento empregadas (0,5 dyne/cm2: p=0,01; 1 dyne/cm2: \np=0,02; 2 dynes/cm2: p=0,03; 3 dynes/cm2: p=0,03; 5 dynes/cm2: p=0,04 e 7 \ndynes/cm2: p=0,03). Especialmente, reticul\u00f3citos de pacientes sem ba\u00e7o \napresentaram maior adesividade \u00e0 HMEC-1 em baixas tens\u00f5es de cisalhamento (1 \ndyne/cm2) em ambas as doen\u00e7as (SCA: p=0,03; HS: p=0,03). Por fim, reticul\u00f3citos \napresentaram maior habilidade adesiva \u00e0 c\u00e9lulas endoteliais em indiv\u00edduos SCA do \nque em pacientes HS, com (0,5 dyne/cm2: p=0,04; 1 dyne/cm2: p=0,03) ou sem ba\u00e7o \n(0,5 dyne/cm2: p=0,02; 2 dynes/cm2: p=0,01; 3 dynes/cm2: p=0,03; 5 dynes/cm2: \np=0,02 e 7 dynes/cm2: p=0,03). CONCLUS\u00c3O: Nossos resultados indicam que \nembora perten\u00e7am ao grupo de Anemias Hemol\u00edticas, as patofisiologias e evolu\u00e7\u00f5es \ncl\u00ednicas distintas de SCA e de HS levam a padr\u00f5es imunofenot\u00edpicos diferentes de \nexpress\u00e3o da ades\u00e3o celular. Na SCA, a aus\u00eancia de fun\u00e7\u00e3o espl\u00eanica teria direta \nrela\u00e7\u00e3o com o aumento do fen\u00f3tipo pr\u00f3-adesivo e com a adesividade de RBCs SCA, \no que traz s\u00e9rias consequ\u00eancias cl\u00ednicas aos pacientes, enquanto na HS sem ba\u00e7o, \nde maneira geral, os eventos de ades\u00e3o celular s\u00e3o minimizados, embora ainda \napresentem reticul\u00f3citos e eritr\u00f3citos adesivos circulantes ap\u00f3s a esplenectomia. \n \nPalavras-chave: Anemia Falciforme, Fun\u00e7\u00e3o Espl\u00eanica, Reticul\u00f3citos, Ades\u00e3o \nCelular, Ba\u00e7o, Esferocitose Heredit\u00e1ria.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nABSTRACT \n\nFERREIRA, P. C. G. Splenic function and cellular adhesion events in Sickle Cell \nAnemia and in Hereditary Spherocytosis. 2018. Thesis (Doctorate). Ribeir\u00e3o Preto \nMedical School, Univerity of S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nINTRODUCTION: Hemolytic Anemias comprise a group of diseases in which there is \nmarked reduction in the survival of circulating erythrocytes and the bone marrow is not \ncapable of compensation, even by increasing its production, which causes anemia \nfrom the first years of the person's life on. Among the diseases of this group, Sickle \nCell Anemia (SCA) and Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) stand out for being diseases \nwith intrinsic genetic defects of red blood cells (RBCs) that generate acute and chronic \nmultisystemic complications in their patients. By distinct pathophysiological pathways, \nreticulocytes and these disease\u2019s respective defective erythrocytes, sickle and \nspheroid ones, are continuously trapped and phagocytosed in the spleen, important \norgan of destruction of old and/or defective cells via extravascular hemolysis, which \nprogressively leads to dysfunction and eventual loss of splenic function. OBJECTIVE: \nTo evaluate the role of the spleen in relation to the reticulocyte (ret) and erythrocyte \n(eryt) adhesive ability and adhesion phenotype in patients with SCA and HS, with and \nwithout preserved splenic function. METHODOLOGY: Blood samples from 37 patients \n(22 SCA and 15 HS) with splenic function and 19 patients (13 SCA and 6 HS) without \nit were evaluated. Still, blood from 22 children with SCA was collected in a longitudinal \nstudy from 6 to 29 months of age. All blood samples were analyzed for splenic function \n[pitted cells (PIT) and Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB) counting], for the cellular \nimmunophenotypic profile (in % and in mean fluorescence intensity - MFI) and for the \nadhesive ability of RBCs to laminin and to endothelial cell line HMEC-1. RESULTS: \nAnalysis of the splenic function loss transition showed that it intensified from 3 years \nof age on (PIT: r=0.8, p<0.0001; HJB: r=0.7, p<0.0001). Regarding the cellular \nimmunophenotyping, PIT count correlated positively, mainly with CD147 markers \n(%ret: r=0.6, p<0.0001; MFIret: r=0.6, p<0.0001; %eryt: r=0.7, p<0.0001; MFIeryt: \nr=0.6, p<0.0001), LuBCAM (%ret: r=0.5, p=0.004; MFIret: r=0.6, p<0.0001; %eryt: \nr=0.6, p<0.0003; MFIeryt: r=0.4, p<0.004) and CD58 (%ret: r=0.4, p=0.006; MFIret: \nr=0.5, p<0.0013; %eryt: r=0.4, p<0.009; MFIeryt: r=0.6, p<0.0001). In the \nimmunophenotypic comparison between spleen absence or presence, the loss of its \nfunction exerted influence on the increase of RBCs adhesion expression in SCA, \nmainly on CD147 (%ret: p=0.002; MFIret: p=0.003; %eryt: p<0.0001; MFIeryt: \np=0.005), LuBCAM (%ret: p=0.0001; MFIret: p<0.0001; %eryt: p<0.0001; MFIeryt: \np<0.0001) e CD58 (%ret: p=0.007; MFIret: p=0.006; %eryt: p=0.003; MFIeryt: \np=0.0004), although cell adhesion has been decreased in splenectomized HS \npatients. In the comparison between diseases, HS patients with spleen showed higher \ncell adhesion frequency compared to SCA, notably in relation to LuBCAM (%ret: \np=0.0008; MFIret: p=0.03; %eryt: p<0.0001; MFIeryt: p=0.0002), CD58 (%ret: \np=0.0009; %eryt: p=0.003) and CD44 (%ret: p=0.009; %eryt: p<0.003). However, \nSCA samples without splenic function had higher cell adhesion expression for CD147 \n(%ret: p=0.006; MFIret: p=0.02; %eryt: p=0.02), LuBCAM (%ret: p=0.004; MFIret: \np<0.0001), CD36 (%ret: p=0.0002; MFIret: p=0.01), CD242 (%ret: p=0.0008; %eryt: \np=0.05) and CD49d (%ret: p=0.04). Concerning the in vitro Adhesion Assay, in the \nspleen absence, SCA RBCs showed greater adhesiveness to laminin than SCA RBCs \nwith preserved splenic function did at all shear stress flow rates applied (0.5 \ndyne/cm2: p=0.01, 1 dyne/cm2: p=0.02, 2 dynes/cm2: p=0.03, 3 dynes/cm2: p=0.03, \n\n\n\n5 dynes/cm2: p=0.04 and 7 dynes/cm2: p=0.03). Especially, reticulocytes from \npatients without spleen showed higher adhesiveness to HMEC-1 at low shear stresses \n(1 dyne/cm2) in both diseases (SCA: p=0.03; HS: p=0.03). Finally, reticulocytes \nshowed greater adhesion ability to endothelial cells in SCA subjects than in HS \npatients, with (0.5 dyne/cm2: p=0.04 and 1 dyne/cm2: p=0.03) or without spleen (0.5 \ndyne/cm2: p=0.02, 2 dynes/cm2: p=0.01, 3 dynes/cm2: p=0.03, 5 dynes/cm2: \np=0.02 and 7 dynes/cm2: p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that although \nboth diseases belong to the Hemolytic Anemias group, SCA and HS distinct \npathophysiologies and clinical evolution lead to different immunophenotypic patterns \nof cell adhesion expression. In SCA, the absence of splenic function may have a direct \nrelation with the increase of SCA RBCs pro-adhesive phenotype and adhesiveness, \nwhich brings serious clinical consequences to the patients, whereas in HS without \nspleen, in general, cellular adhesion events are minimized, although they still present \nadhesive circulating reticulocytes and erythrocytes after splenectomy. \n \nKeywords: Sickle Cell Anemia, Splenic Function, Reticulocytes, Cellular Adhesion, \nSpleen, Hereditary Spherocytosis. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS \nAB  Antibody \nBSA Bovine serum albumin \nBT Total bilirubin \nCD Cluster of differentiation \nCONEP National Commission for Ethics on Research \nDIC Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy \nEDTA Etilenodiaminotetracetic acid \nFBS Fetal bovine serum \nHb Hemoglobin \nHbF Fetal hemoglobin \nHBSS Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution \nHC Hydroxycarbamide \nHCFMRP Clinical Hospital of the Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Medical School \nHct Hematocrit \nHEPA High efficiency particulate air \nHEPES 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid \nHJB Howell-Jolly bodies \nHMEC-1 Transfected Human Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cells - 1 \nHS  Hereditary Spherocytosis \nHSA Human serum albumin \nIgG Immunoglobulin G \nLDH Lactate dehydrogenase \n\nLuBCAM Basal cell adhesion molecule (Lutheran blood group), also known as CD239 \nMCDB131 Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology 131 \nMCHC Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration \nMCV Medium corpuscular volume \nMFI Mean fluorescence intensity \nPALS Periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths \nPBS Phosphate buffered saline \nPE Phycoerythrin \nPIT  Pitted cells  \nRBC Red blood cells \nrpm Revolutions per minute \n\n\n\nRPMI Roswell Park Memorian Institute medium \nRT Room temperature \nSCA Sickle Cell Anemia \nTNF-?

INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1. Hemolytic Hemolitic Anemias \n\n Hemolytic Hemolytic Anemias comprise a group of diseases in which there \n\nis a marked reduction in the survival of circulating red blood cells and the bone \n\nmarrow is not capable of compensation even by increasing its production. There \n\nare several diseases included in the Hemolytic Anemias group. They may occur \n\ndue to intrinsic or extrinsic defects of the red blood cells. The present study deals \n\nwith the first classification of defects, the intrinsic ones, which in turn can be \n\nsubdivided into three categories: 1) hemoglobin abnormalities; 2) abnormalities \n\nof the RBC membrane; 3) abnormalities of erythrocyte enzymes. (Dhaliwal, et al., \n\n2004; Zago, et al., 2013). Of the two diseases addressed in this work, the first \n\none, Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is caused by a hemoglobin abnormality and the \n\nsecond one, Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS), is due to an abnormality of the RBC \n\nmembrane. \n\n Hemoglobin (Hb) is a protein abundant in red blood cells, composed of two \n\ntypes of globin chain in vertebrates. In humans, it can be encoded from seven \n\nparalogous genes (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? and ?) that are transcribed at different stages of \n\ndevelopment. The ?-globin gene is expressed in the early embryo, ? in the late \n\nembryo and in the fetus, and ? and ? are expressed mainly in adults. Each Hb \n\nmolecule is a complex of two chains of two types (for example, two ? chains and \n\ntwo ? ones \u2013 ?2?2), which form four binding sites (heme groups) to the iron atom. \n\nThe oxygenation process, in its turn, takes place with the iron interaction with the \n\noxygen molecule. That process allows a reversible cooperative allosteric \n\nmodification in the Hb as it binds to oxygen and releases it (Alberts, et al., 2010). \n\n There are two mechanisms of hemolysis: the intravascular and the \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n3 \n\nextravascular. In the first mechanism, there is the destruction of red blood cells \n\nin the circulation with the release of cell contents into the plasma. Mechanical \n\ntrauma from a damaged endothelium, complement fixation and activation on the \n\ncell surface, and infectious agents may cause direct membrane degradation and \n\ncell destruction. In its turn, extravascular hemolysis is the removal and destruction \n\nof red blood cells with membrane alterations by the macrophages of the spleen \n\nand liver (Dhaliwal, et al., 2004). \n\n In the natural hemolysis process, when RBCs rupture, the released \n\nhemoglobin is phagocytosed by macrophages. Globin chains of hemoglobin are \n\nthen broken down to individual amino acids that are metabolized or used to build \n\nnew proteins. Iron is released from the heme fraction of the hemoglobin and the \n\nremaining structure is converted into biliverdin, which is then converted into \n\nbilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase. Iron is transported by transferrin in \n\nthe blood to some tissues, such as liver and spleen, for storage or to the bone \n\nmarrow for making new hemoglobin, while free bilirubin is transported by albumin \n\nin the blood to the liver. Hepatocytes conjugated bilirubin which is excreted as \n\npart of the bile in the small intestine and intestinal bacterias convert bilirubin into \n\nbilirubin derivatives which contribute to the color of feces. Some of the bilirubin \n\nderivatives are absorbed into the blood and are excreted from the kidneys. \n\nElevated levels of bilirubin in the blood together with other laboratory tests with \n\nfurther markers of hemolysis may be indicative of intravascular hemolysis \n\n(Embury, et al., 1994; Zago, et al., 2013).  \n\n In this context, intravascular hemolysis may be related to important \n\nimplications of the Hemolytic Anemias pathophysiology. For instance, Nouraie et \n\nal (2013) derived a hemolytic component from well-known markers of hemolysis \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n4 \n\nand confirmed based on this component that associations between the patients\u2019 \n\nhemolytic rate and important clinical outcomes in SCA, such as systemic \n\nhypertension, increases in Doppler-estimated pulmonary systolic pressures, \n\nendothelial dysfunction and mortality, are determined in part by the process of \n\nintravascular hemolysis. \n\n \n\n1.2. Sickle Cell Anemia  \n\n Of the intrinsic defects of the red blood cells that can lead to Hemolytic \n\nAnemias, the first aforementioned, the hemoglobin abnormality, encompasses a \n\nvery important group of disorders, the Sickle Cell Diseases (SCD). Such group is \n\ndivided into ethnic subgroups of geographically distinct regions according to the \n\nhaplotype of ?-globin S that they carry, which include Senegal (SEN), Benin \n\n(BEN), Bantu or Central African Republic (CAR), Cameroon (CAM) and Arabic-\n\nIndian (ARAB) (Logetto, 2013). The highest prevalence of SCD takes place in the \n\nsub-Saharan Africa. Data from the World Health Organization in 2008 have \n\nestimated that over 330,000 children are born annually affected with some \n\nhemoglobin disorder, and of this number, 83% account for Sickle Cell Disorders \n\n(Modell and Darlison, 2008) \n\n SCD distribution of the disease worldwide is due to two main factors: the \n\nselection of carriers for their advantage over endemic areas of malaria and to the \n\npopulation migration. SCA genes have arisen in areas where the protozoan \n\nparasite Plasmodium falciparum that causes malaria is endemic and it is believed \n\nthat the high levels of prevalence of such genes in these regions confer \n\nresistance of the sickle RBC to the protozoan. Therefore, this fact introduced \n\nselective pressure in the human genome and erythrocytes became the main \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n5 \n\ntarget for evolutionary adaptation. In fact, the greater resistance of the sickle cell \n\ntrait carriers that is, asymptomatic carriers, to malaria is considerable and infected \n\nasymptomatic heterozygous children have lower parasite densities than healthy \n\nchildren and are 50%-90% less likely to progress to a severe form of malaria or \n\nto die from the disease (Bunn, 2013). According to the historical origin of the Afro-\n\ndescendant population in Brazil as a result of the slave trade, the most common \n\nhaplotype of ?-globin S is CAR, followed by BEN, mainly in the northeastern and \n\nsoutheastern regions of the country (Loggetto, 2013). \n\n Individuals with SCD necessarily inherit a maternal and a paternal \n\nmutation. Inherited mutations may be homozygous (SS), the only genotype that \n\ncan be termed as \"Sickle Cell Anemia\u201d, or compound heterozygous, that is, the \n\ndisease is caused by the inheritance of hemoglobin S (HbS) in combination with \n\nanother defect (structural or synthetic) in Hb [SC, SD, SE, S beta-thalassemia \n\n(SBetaTAL), S alpha-thalassemia or S rare mutant]. It is estimated that 4% of the \n\nBrazilian population carries the sickle cell trait (simple heterozygosis) and that \n\n25,000 to 50,000 people have the disease in the homozygous state (SS \u2013 SCA) \n\nor in compound or double heterozygous (SC, SE, SD, SBetaTAL \u2013 SCD) \n\n(Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade \u2013 Brasil, 2016). \n\n SCA is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that gives rise to \n\nhemoglobin S (HbS), an abnormal Hb. This defect happens due to a point \n\nmutation in codon 6 of the ?-globin gene that is present on the short arm of \n\nchromosome 11. The alteration causes the substitution of the adenine nucleotide \n\nfor thymine (from GAG to GTG) which leads to the generation of the mutant amino \n\nacid valine instead of the normal amino acid glutamic acid (Maier-Redelsperger, \n\net al., 1998; Lodish, et al., 2002; Voskaridou, et al., 2012).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n6 \n\n This mutation leads to serious consequences for the individual, such as \n\nRBCs sickling. In it, HbS polymerizes reversibly when it undergoes \n\ndeoxygenation in low oxygen stress situations and forms fibrous intracellular \n\ncrystalline aggregates that harden the erythrocyte membrane, increase viscosity \n\nand cause dehydration due to the escape of potassium and the influx of calcium \n\ninto the cell. RBCs morphology of the red blood cells changes and acquires a \n\nsickle shape, which causes the cells to lose the ability to carry oxygen and to \n\ntravel through small capillaries properly (Darghouth et al., 2011; Voskaridou, et \n\nal., 2012). Sickle RBCs specifically alter the adhesion molecules expression \n\npattern on their surface and start adhering abnormally to the endothelium of \n\nsmaller vessels. Microvascular vasoconstriction and immature erythrocyte \n\ndestruction processes are established and lead the patient to severe Hemolytic \n\nAnemia state (Darghouth et al., 2011; Voskaridou, et al., 2012; Rees, et al., \n\n2010). Although this sickling phenomenon may be reversible with reoxygenation, \n\nwhen systematically repeated, it may intensify the functional alterations and the \n\ncell becomes irreversibly sickled (Naoum and Naoum, 2004). \n\n The symptoms that result from this genetic alteration are, therefore, \n\nserious and worthy of mention. Erythrocytes of affected individuals become rigid \n\nand their traffic through the capillaries becomes blocked, which causes severe \n\npain and tissue injury (Lodish, et al., 2002). Vasocclusion events promote \n\nischemia, hemolysis and tissue inflammation, which leads to acute pain, acute \n\nchest syndrome, hyposplenism, osteonecrosis and nephropathy in patients, \n\namong other complications. Reperfusion episodes may also lead to pulmonary \n\nhypertension, priapism, leg ulcers, and cerebrovascular disease (Embury, et al., \n\n1994; Rees, et al., 2010). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n7 \n\n Thus, the rate of hemolysis and the degree of anemia have important \n\npathophysiological and clinical consequences in sickle cell anemia. A decreased \n\nhemoglobin concentration leads to decreased delivery of oxygen to the tissues. \n\nIntravascular hemolysis leads to the release of hemoglobin and arginase-1 into \n\nthe plasma, into the scavenging of plasma NO by cell-free hemoglobin, and into \n\nthe depletion by arginase-1 of plasma arginine, the obligate substrate for the NO \n\nsynthases.  These processes may contribute to reduced NO bioavailability and \n\nvascular dysfunction, which leads to the endothelium activation and a cicle of \n\nRBC sickling and to the vasoclusive events. (Chiang and Frenette, 2005; Nouraie \n\net al., 2013). \n\n  \n\n1.3. Hereditary Spherocytosis \n\n  Hereditary spherocytosis is a type of Hemolytic Anemia, responsible for \nqualitative and/or quantitative alterations of the erythrocyte membrane proteins. \n\nSome typical morphological alterations are high osmotic fragility and increased \n\ndensity and spherical shape which leads to decreased survival of the erythrocytes \n\ndue to marked degradation carried out by the spleen (An and Mohandas, 2008; \n\nGallagher, 2013). \n\n HS prevalence is high in northern European populations (approximately \n\n50/1000,000), lower in latin white populations (20 to 30/100,000) and even \n\nsmaller in black and yellow populations. Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic \n\nautosomal dominant disorder. However, about 10% of those people affected do \n\nnot present any type of family history related to the disease, in which case the \n\npathology comes from some type of mutation (Granjo et al, 2003).   \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n8 \n\n The disease genetic alterations generate modifications in erythrocyte \n\nmembrane proteins, such as spectrin, band-3 protein, protein 4.2, but mainly on \n\nankyrin. The membrane proteins, associated to the lipid bilayer are supposed to \n\nprovide rigidity and integrity to the erythrocyte membrane. Nevertheless, due to \n\nthe genetic alteration, erythrocytes lose vertical linkage between membrane \n\nskeleton and lipid bilayer and undergo microvesiculations formation, which \n\ndecrease the surface area without altering the cell volume. Importantly, the \n\nseverity of anaemia is directly related to extent of membrane surface area loss. \n\nWith decrease in pH, glucose concentrations, ATP and the increase in the \n\nnumber of circulating free radicals, events like loss of elasticity and difficulties in \n\nthe passage through the endothelial cells and the spleen may become frequent \n\nand eventually lead to great splenic vascular congestion (An and Mohandas, \n\n2008; Gallagher, 2013; Zago, et al., 2013). \n\n Main HS clinical symptoms encompasses jaundice, likely to happen with \n\nhemolysis of any kind, splenomegaly and gallstones formation. To indentify HS, \n\nthe most characteristic feature is increase of MCHC (mean corpuscular \n\nhemoglobin concentration) due to the dehydration caused by loss of K+ ions and \n\nwater (Gallagher, 2013; Zago, et al., 2013).  \n\n Regarding the HS treatment, splenectomy is generally recommended for \n\npatients from 5 years of age on who present splenomegaly, reticulocytosis, \n\nhypoplastic and aplastic crises, growth deficit or cardiomegaly. However, once \n\nconsidered routine, growing recognition of the longterm risks of splenectomy, \n\nincluding cardiovascular disease, thrombotic disorders, and pulmonary \n\nhypertension, as well as the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci, a \n\nconcern for infection in overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, have led to re-\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n9 \n\nevaluation of the role of splenectomy.  Vaccinations have been shown to play an \n\nimportant role in reducing the number of cases of sepsis mortality after \n\nsplenectomy (An and Mohandas, 2008; Zago, et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n1.4. Spleen  \n\n The spleen is an intraperitoneal organ located on the left side of the body, \nright below the ribs and it lies in the left upper quadrant, under the diaphragm. \n\nThis organ is covered by a capsule and consists of two major types of tissue: the \n\nred pulp and the white pulp. The red pulp is where the red blood cells (RBCs) \n\nundergo a refined quality control while the white pulp is part of the immune \n\nsystem, in which by the way, the spleen has a very important role by scanning \n\nthe blood for evidence of bacterial infection (Embury, et al., 1994)  \n\n There are two circulatory routes through the splenic pulp: open and closed \n\ncirculation. In a nutshell, a closed \u201cfast flow\u201d circulation drains blood directly into \n\nthe venous sinusoids, flowing together to become trabecular veins. In an open \n\n\u201cslow flow\u201d circulation, blood flows into a reticular fibrous framework of the red \n\npulp and/or via the marginal zone of the lymphatic tissue before reaching the \n\nsinusoids (Vancauwenberghe, et al., 2015).  \n\n So, the blood system in the spleen holds a unique open system consisted \n\nof trabeculae coming within the tissue. Blood comes in through the trabecular \n\nartery and into the central artery. In its surrounding area, there are a lot of \n\nlymphocytes forming the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS), that are a \n\nmassive lymphoid tissue consisted mainly of T cells and macrophages, which \n\nscreens the blood for the presence of bacteria and viruses and initiates antibody \n\nresponses against those as well as producing antibodies. Surrounding the PALS, \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n10 \n\nthere is another lymphoid tissue called the marginal zone, which is made of \n\npredominantly macrophages. Within this tissue, there are other lymphatic tissues \n\ncalled follicles, which are essentially surrounded by the marginal zone and \n\ncontain immune B cells. Together, the PALS, the marginal zone and the follicles \n\nform what so-called white pulp of the spleen (Vancauwenberghe, et al., 2015; \n\nSteiniger, 2015; Embury, et al., 1994). \n\n On the blood way into the spleen, splenic arteries go into capillaries which \n\neventually break down, lose their wall structure and the RBCs end up in \n\nformations called venus sinuses. In the natural splenic physiology, RBCs very \n\nslowly migrate in these very large sinuses in the presence of many macrophages \n\nthat, in their turn, scan the red cells for any evidence of dysfunction, in order to \n\nremove old damaged red cells from the blood. Between the end arteries and the \n\nvenus sinuses, there is an area of tissue called the cords, which contains plenty \n\nof macrophages. Together, the cords and the venus sinuses make up the red \n\npulp above-mentioned. The white pulp represents around 25% of the splenic \n\ntissue, which makes the other 75% consisted of the red pulp, but the ratio of white \n\nto red pulp increases with age due to accumulated antigenic exposure and \n\nstimulation (Brousse, et al., 2014; Steiniger, 2015).  \n\n Thus, the main role of the splenic red pulp is to destroy or filter abnormal, \n\nunhealthy or older RBCs. To do so, the slits presented between the endothelial \n\ncells of the venus sinuses are important. When these cells move into the venus \n\nsinuses, they are drained into the collecting veins before being drained into the \n\nsplenic vein. However, old and defective RBCs are unable to pass through the \n\nslits effectively and thus are phagocytized by the surrounding macrophages. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n11 \n\nThen, the cleaned or healthy RBCs are released back into the splenic vein and \n\ninto the blood system (Embury, et al., 1994; Brousse, et al., 2014). \n\n If the spleen is removed from a person, one will produce lower amounts of \n\nantibodies and will be at an increased risk of infection. Besides that, the blood of \n\nan splenectomized person presents an increased number of abnormal RBCs in \n\nthe circulation, such as those containing Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB), which are \n\nremnants of the nucleus from the erythropoiesis maturation process (Corazza, et \n\nal., 1990; Brousse, et al., 2014). HJB presence is also related to hyposplenism, \n\neven when the spleen remains with a normal size or enlarged, the so-called \n\nfunctional hyposplenism (Covas and Zago, 1987; Sears and Udden, 2012). Still, \n\nanother important marker of splenic dysfunction observed in splenectomized \n\nindividuals is the presence of vacuoles on RBCs surface when observed under \n\nInterference Contrast Microscopy, which has also become another diagnostic \n\nfactor for hyposplenism (Natham and Gunn, 1966; Brousse, et al., 2014). \n\n On the other hand, one of the criteria used for the diagnosis of \n\nhypersplenism is the presence of splenomegaly. Enlargement of the splenic \n\nvolume occurs in proportion to the increase in the RBC volume stored in the \n\nexpanded extra sinus spaces. In this situation, normal RBCs penetrating the \n\nsplenic red pulp face adverse conditions represented by high hematocrit (Hct) \n\nand decrease in the energetic substrates levels and in ph levels. Together, these \n\nfactors lead to the drop of ATP levels with consequent instability and loss of \n\nmembrane components, decrease in deformability and consequent erythrocytes \n\nretention and lysis (Covas, 1985). \n\n Briefly, splenic injury is generally silent and progressive. It can be clinically \n\novert with acute splenic sequestration of red cells, an unpredictable and life-\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n12 \n\nthreatening complication in infants. Splenomegaly, with or without hypersplenism, \n\ncan also occur and can coexist with loss of function. Hyposplenism, in its turn, \n\nincreases the susceptibility of SCA children to infection with encapsulated \n\nbacteria, which is notably reduced by penicillin prophylaxis and immunization \n\n(Brousse, et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n1.5. Cellular adhesion interactions \n\n The bone marrow is responsible for the process of erythropoiesis, which \n\nconsists of several stages of differentiation, from erythroid colony forming units \n\nto mature red cells. Such process may also occur extramedullary in other organs, \n\nsuch as the spleen in specific cases (Chasis, 2006; Zago, et al., 2013). \n\n Macrophages are known for the major role in terminal erythropoiesis in a \n\nspecialized microenvironment called the erythroblastoside island. In this \n\nstructure, erythroblasts receive the necessary conditions for their maturation and \n\ntheir expelled nucleus undergoes phagocytosis by the central macrophage \n\n(Chasis, 2006; De Back, et al., 2014). The close relationship between \n\nmacrophage and erythroblasts is evidenced in the expression of various surface \n\nmarkers such as VCAM-1 and ?V integrin in macrophages and ?4?1 and ICAM-\n\n4 integrin in erythroblasts (Chasis, 2006; De Back, et al., 2014).  \n\n \tWith the release of sickle erythrocytes, in SCA, and of early reticulocytes \n\nin Hemolytic Anemias in general into the circulation, the spleen plays a crucial \n\nrole in the clearance of these abnormally more adhesive cells because it already \n\nnaturally has a destructive role in the recycling process of old erythrocytes, when \n\nextravascular hemolysis takes place (Manwani and Bieker, 2008). Therefore, it is \n\nrelevant to analyze the adhesion molecules expression pattern of immature or \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n13 \n\ndefective cells released into the circulation in the absence and presence of this \n\norgan in Hemolytic Anemias. \n\n Nowadays, there are some methods available that allow us to assess the \n\nsplenic function and some adhesion molecules that may be important in spleen \n\nfunction absence. In addition to conducting the immunophenotypic study of the \n\ncells of interest, one of the possible approaches to investigate the adhesive \n\nabilities of the pathophysiological characteristics of Hemolytic Anemias in vitro is \n\nto evaluate patients' blood regarding their rheological properties. Knowing the \n\nRBCs adhesion behavior against some substrates via molecular interactions is \n\nof great importance in the study of Hemolytic Anemias, particularly at low shear \n\nstress flow rates that mimic the natural microcapillaries flow, once it can provide \n\ninformation on cell-cell and on cell-extracellular matrix interactions via, for \n\ninstance, an adhesion assay (El Nemer, et al., 2008). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHYPOTHESIS \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n15 \n\n2. HYPOTHESIS \n\n The chronic hemolysis observed in SCA causes early release into the \n\ncirculation of young reticulocytes that, together with the disease characteristic \n\ncirculating sickle erythocytes, express greater number of adhesion molecules, \n\nwhich stimulates the vasocclusive phenomenon. In this context, the investigation \n\nof the splenic role on the cellular adhesion profile and on the cellular \n\nadhesiveness in SCA becomes as necessary as in other Hemolytic Anemias, \n\nsuch as HS for instance. However, by presenting chronic hemolysis caused by a \n\ndifferent pathophysiological mechanism, HS offers, in turn, a counterpoint to the \n\nprocess of red blood cell sickling and of VO crisis in SCA and their consequences \n\nfor the splenic function, that is noteworthy. \n\n Besides the role in the removal of old erythrocytes, the spleen has an \n\nimportant protective function, contributing to the decrease of peripheral blood \n\ncells that abnormally express adhesion molecules on their surface, such as sickle \n\nerythrocytes and those with membrane defects. Therefore, the loss of splenic \n\nfunction would initially have a direct relationship with the increase of pro-adhesive \n\nphenotype and adhesiveness of reticulocytes and red blood cells in the peripheral \n\ncirculation of patients with SCA and HS. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOBJECTIVES \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n17 \n\n3. OBJECTIVES \n\n3.1. Broad objective \n\n To evaluate the role of the spleen in relation to the adhesive phenotype \n\nand ability of reticulocytes and erythrocytes in patients with Hemolytic Anemias. \n\n3.2. Specific objectives \n\n - To assess the splenic function loss transition in patients with Sickle Cell \n\nAnemia; \n\n - To assess the correlation of splenic function loss (PIT counting) with the \n\nincrease of circulating adhesive reticulocytes and erythrocytes in SCA and HS; \n\n - To evaluate the influence of the spleen presence or absence on the \n\nadhesion expression of circulating reticulocytes and erythrocytes of patients with \n\nSCA and HS;  \n\n - To assess the influence of the two diseases addressed in this study, SCA \n\nand HS, regarding the adhesion expression on their circulating reticulocytes and \n\nerythrocytes at the same condition, either with or without spleen. \n\n - To compare the spleen role on the adhesive potential of circulating \n\nreticulocytes and erythrocytes of SCA and HS patients in an in vitro Cell Adhesion \n\nAssay. \n\n - To compare the adhesive potential of circulating reticulocytes and \n\nerythrocytes between both diseases at the same condition, either with or without \n\nspleen in an in vitro Cell Adhesion Assay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n19 \n\n4. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n4.1. Experimental design \n\n The groups were divided according to the type of disease and, within the \n\ngroup of patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, according to the transition range of the \n\nsplenic dysfunction evolution considered in the literature, which points to the \n\nperiod between 1 and 2 years of age (Pearson, et al., 1985; Rogers et al., 2011). \n\nThus, for the purpose of categorization, patients with up to 2 years and 5 months \n\nof age were included in the group called SCA with preserved splenic function, \n\nand in turn, the SCA group without preserved splenic function was constituted of \n\nindividuals 3 years old or older participating in the research. \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Follow-up of the splenic function loss transition \n\n\u2022 SCA group with preserved splenic function - in this first group \n\napproach, a longitudinal study has been conducted in order to evaluate the \n\nspleen parameters of individuals affected by SCA with up to 2 years and 5 months \n\nof age, specifically in the following time Windows of 4 months each: from 6 to 9, \n\nfrom 10 to 13, from 14 to 17, from 18 to 21 and from 22 to 29 months of life. \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Analysis of splenic function loss in SCA and in HS patients \n\n Groups of patients whose blood samples were collected for this analysis \n\nare as it follows: \n\n\u2022 SCA group with preserved splenic function \u2013 children mentioned \n\nabove were also considered in this second approach of the study, as the group \n\nthat has not completely lost splenic function yet and that, therefore, is in this \n\ntransition. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n20 \n\n\u2022 SCA group without preserved splenic function \u2013 SCA patients from \n\n3 years old, as the group without splenic function or with almost complete loss of \n\nit. \n\n\u2022 HS group with spleen - HS patients who still have the spleen. \n\n\u2022 HS group without spleen \u2013HS splenectomized patients. \n\n Patients who presented any disease in their health history that might affect \n\ntheir immunity or splenic function, blood transfusion within the previous 3 months \n\nof collection or a severe sepsis episode were excluded. This selection has been \n\nmade based on the analysis of the exams held in the patients' medical records, \n\nso that no additional examination has been requested for this project\u2019s \n\ndevelopment.  \n\n \n\n4.2. Sample obtention \n\n  This is an observational study whose permission for sample obtention was \n\npreviously approved by the Research Ethics Committee of HC-FMRP and by \n\nCONEP (CAAE: 46629915.0.000.5440). The Informed Consent Form for the \n\ncollection and use of biological material and the Informed Consent Form for the \n\nstorage of biological material given to the participants are shown respectively in \n\nAppendices 8.1 and 8.2.  \n\n \n\n4.3. Red blood cell freezing and thawing \n\n From each fresh blood sample collected in EDTA tubes, 2 mL were \n\nseparated to be frozen and stored. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm \n\nfor 10 minutes at 4\u00baC. Plasma was discarded and the erythrocytes were \n\nincubated in 40% Glycerol solution (Formule 548 - INTS, Paris, France) at a \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n21 \n\nvolume ratio of 1:2, for 10 minutes and then transferred to cryogenic 0.5 mL \n\nstraws (Cryo Bio System, Saint Ouen sur Iton, France).  Glycerol is an attractive \n\nred blood cell cryoprotective agent because it is relatively nontoxic at high \n\nconcentrations and it readily permeates the cell at 37\u00baC (Scott, et al., 2005). The \n\nblood was subjected to a slow cryopreservation process in the Freezal freezing \n\nmachine (Air LiquideTM, Paris, France) in order to prevent excessive cell volume \n\nreduction and the lethal concentration of electrolytes and to prevent inappropriate \n\nformation of ice crystals which can cause rupture of the red blood cells (Scott, et \n\nal., 2005; Stolzing A, et al., 2012). The freezing curve has been standardized \n\nafter several tests in which, besides different rates of temperature decline having \n\nbeen applied, two parameters have been considered post-thawing of the tested \n\nsamples: calculation of the free hemoglobin concentration and visual \n\nclassification of hemolysis. The adopted curve consists of two stages of freezing \n\nspeed: 1st) from 5 to -40\u00baC (decline of 1\u00baC/minute) and 2nd) from -40\u00baC to -100\u00baC \n\n(decline of 10\u00baC/minute). After this procedure, the samples were stored in liquid \n\nnitrogen (-196\u00baC) for later use in the Adhesion Assay described below. \n\n Once thawed, the blood samples were diluted in 10% Glycerol solution \n\n(Formule 534 - INTS, Paris, France) at a volume ratio of 1:3 and centrifuged at \n\n2500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00baC. After the supernatant was discarded and the red \n\nblood cell pellet was resuspended in 8% (1:3) Sorbitol solution (Formule 533-\n\nINTS, Paris, France), further centrifugation under the same conditions was \n\nperformed. The pellet of red blood cells was then sequentially washed in 0.9% \n\nphysiological solution (JP Ind\u00fastria Farmac\u00eautica S.A., Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil) \n\nand centrifuged 5 times before being resuspended in a stabilizing formulated \n\nglycine buffered saline (ID-Cell Stab, BioRad\u00ae, Lagoa Santa, Brazil) at a \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n22 \n\nconcentration of 0.8%. Samples were then stored overnight at 4\u00baC, ready to be \n\nused in the Cell Adhesion Assay in the following day. \n\n4.4. Pitted cells counting \n\n One of the ways to assess the splenic function loss is to quantify the \n\ncirculating erythrocytes that present depressions in their cell membranes, the so \n\ncalled pitted cells, which, under normal physiological conditions, appear gradually \n\nin higher frequency as the cells age and, under pathophysiological conditions, \n\nappear on a larger scale due to splenic dysfunction.  For each sample, two drops \n\nof fresh blood were fixed immediately after its collection in 0.3 mL of 3% \n\nformaldehyde in buffered solution, at pH 7.4. After 30 minutes, one drop of the \n\nmaterial has been transferred to a slide and covered with a coverslip for \n\nobservation under a microscope with immersion oil, magnification of x63. Five \n\nhundred cells per patient were evaluated and the percentage of cells that had \n\none or more depressions was quantified. Images of pitted cells were also \n\nrecorded by the microscope software. The erythrocytes have been analyzed with \n\nNormasky's Microscopy or Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy \u2013 DIC \n\n(Axio Observer A1 - Carl Zeiss\u00ae, Jena, Germany). \n\n \n\n4.5. Howell-Jolly bodies counting \n\n Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB) are nuclear remnants presented in circulating \n\nred blood cells which have not been properly removed by the spleen (Brousse et \n\nal., 2014). For quantification of the frequency of red cells that contain such \n\nremnants, fresh blood smears previously collected in EDTA were analyzed with \n\nimmersion oil (x100) under light microscopy after May-Gr\u00fcnwald and Giemsa \n\nstaining (Lewis et al., 2006). Ten microscopic fields were considered for each \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n23 \n\nblood smear, with 100 erythrocytes analysed in each field, in order to obtain an \n\nestimate of the cell percentage with HJB in a sample of 1000 erythrocytes per \n\npatient. After quantification, images of cells with HJB were performed on a \n\nmicroscope equipped with a digital camera in the AxioVision\u2122 software (Axio \n\nObserver A1 - Carl Zeiss\u00ae, Jena, Germany). \n\n  \n\n4.6. Cellular immunophenotyping \n\n Immunophenotyping of erythrocytes and reticulocytes was carried out on \n\nblood samples collected after 60 hours of storage at 4\u00baC in stabilizing formulated \n\nglycine buffered saline at 0.8%. The red blood cells concentrate was diluted in \n\n0.2% BSA PBS solution and incubated with primary antibodies (ABs) against the \n\nsurface molecules IgG, CD36, CD44, CD47, CD49d, CD58, CD99, CD108, \n\nCD147, CD151, CD239 (LuBCAM) and CD242, for 60 minutes at room \n\ntemperature (RT). Excess of AB was removed with two washes at 1200 rpm for \n\n3 minutes at RT. Secondary ABs conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE) fluorophore \n\nwere used to label the primary antibodies at a 1/150 dilution, for 45 minutes at \n\nRT in the dark. Further washes were performed and all tubes containing the \n\nabove-mentioned antibodies were later labeled with ReticCount\u2122 reagent \n\n(thiazole orange) (BD Biosciences\u00ae, San Jose, USA), for 30 minutes at RT in the \n\ndark, for further analysis of the mean intensity fluorescence (MFI) and of the \n\nreticulocytes and red blood cells frequency of expressing the adhesion molecules \n\nadopted in this study. FACSDiva\u2122 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences\u00ae, San Jose, \n\nUSA) was used to analyse the results, using FACSDiva Version 6.1.1 software \n\n(BD Biosciences\u00ae, San Jose, EUA) for acquisiton of data, in order to eliminate \n\npossible cell agregates or doublets presented in the samples, which could \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n24 \n\ngenerate false-positive results. Furthermore, on the day of each collection, 5 ?L \n\nof fresh blood from each patient were labeled with 1 mL of ReticCount\u2122, for 30 \n\nminutes in the dark at RT, in order to determine the percentage of reticulocytes \n\nin the total human peripheral blood analyzed. These samples were processed on \n\nthe FACSCalibur\u2122 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences\u00ae, San Jose, USA). Negative \n\ncontrols were performed both for antibody labeling and for ReticCount\u2122 labeling. \n\nBoth systems were calibrated for the evaluation of at least 10,000 events in each \n\ndetermination.  \n\n   \n\n4.7. Cellular adhesion assay  \n\n4.7.1. Expansion of the HMEC-1 lineage \n\n Transfected human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) \n\n(ATCC, Chicago, USA) were grown in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental \n\nBiology (MCDB) 131 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) supplemented with \n\n10 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, USA), 1 \n\n?g/mL of hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), 10 mM of glutamine \n\n(Gibco\u2122, Grand Island, USA), 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, \n\nUSA), 100 U/mL of penicillin (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) and 100 ?M of \n\nstreptomycin (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) at pH 7.4.  \n\n Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator, with HEPA grade 100 \n\nfilter (Thermo Electron Corporation, Marietta, USA), at 37 \u00baC and 5% CO2 and \n\nmanipulated in vertical laminar flow (Thermo Electron Corporation, Marietta, \n\nUSA). Once having reached about 80% of confluency, the endothelial cells were \n\nwashed twice with PBS. Then, enzymatic cleavage has been performed with \n\n0.025% trypsin solution (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) with 0.5 mM of EDTA and \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n25 \n\n1 mM of sodium pyruvate (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) for 5 minutes. Cells detached \n\nfrom the plastic bottles were resuspended in RPMI with 10% FBS, centrifuged at \n\n1200 rpm for 10 minutes at RT and seeded into Vena Flux Endothelial+\u2122 \n\nbiochips with eight parallel microcapillaries 0.8 mm wide (Cellix\u00ae, Dublin, Ireland) \n\nat a concentration of 2x107 cells/mL in 20 ?l of complete MCDB131 medium in \n\neach biochip channel. Such channels had been previously pretreated with 0.1 \n\nmg/mL type I collagen (Corning\u00ae, Wiesbaden, Germany) for at least 15 minutes \n\nat 37\u00baC. Seeded channels with HMEC-1 were incubated for 2 hours before being \n\nconnected to the closed Kima pump system (Cellix\u00ae, Dublin, Ireland). \n\n \n\n4.7.2. Treatment with laminin \n\n In the meantime, while the microcapillaries were seeded with HMEC-1, \n\nothers were treated with 20 ?l of laminin solution (Biolamine, Stockholm, Sweden) \n\nin each channel, at 10 ?g/mL overnight in a humid chamber at 4\u00baC. On the day \n\nof the experiment, each laminin-treated channel was saturated with a 0.5% BSA \n\nsolution in PBS, one hour prior to the experiment, in order to avoid non-specific \n\nbinding between endothelial cells and red cells receptors. \n\n \n\n4.7.3. Adhesion assay preparation \n\n The Dynamic Adhesion Platform is a tool that allows the user to mimic \n\nvenous and arterial physiological flow and blood shear stress by means of a \n\nsystem that includes the biochips with microcapillaries previously mentioned and \n\na set of microfluidic syringe pumps (ExiGo\u2122, Cellix\u00ae, Dublin, Ireland) controlled \n\nby a LabVIEW interface with the aid of Exigo\u2122 flow sensors (Cellix\u00ae, Dublin, \n\nIreland) (Cooke et al., 1993).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n26 \n\n After 2 hours of incubation at 37\u00baC, the biochip coated with HMEC-1 cells \n\nwas connected to the Kima pump, which allows the intermittent pumping of \n\nculture medium onto the endothelial cells. Its running is carried out via wireless \n\nconnection to an iPod Touch whose iKima application has been programmed to \n\nexecute the flow of culture medium in two steps: 1st) flow rate of 600 ?L/minute \n\nand perfusion time of 30 seconds; 2nd) without flow for 40 minutes. After 8 hours \n\nof incubation, TNF-a at a concentration of 5x10-3 ?g/mL was added to the system, \n\nin order to promote activation of endothelial cells. The cells remained a total of \n\n24 hours connected to the Kima pump. \n\n On the experiment day, biochips previously seeded with HMEC-1 or \n\ntreated with laminin were taken to the Adhesion Platform microscope where they \n\nwere connected to the syringe pump system and its sensors. Such sensors allow \n\nthe user to precisely dispense a certain volume of liquid at specific flow rates into \n\nthe capillaries. Channels treated with HMEC-1 cells remained at a temperature \n\nof 37\u00baC. \n\n \n\n4.7.4. Blood sample preparation \n\n On the experiment day, the red cell pellet previously thawed, washed and \n\nstored in ID-Cell Stab has been washed again twice with physiological solution \n\nand diluted in 1 mL of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) \n\ncontaining 3.7 g/L of sodium bicarbonate (Sigma, St. Louis, USA), 10 mM of 4- \n\n(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (Sigma, St. Louis, \n\nUSA), 100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 ?M of streptomycin, 0.5 M of calcium chloride \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), 0.5 M of magnesium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n27 \n\nLouis, USA) and 0,4% of human serum albumin (HSA) (Vialebex\u00ae, Lille, France) \n\nat pH 7.4. \n\n In order to observe the red cell adhesion ability to laminin, the blood pellet \n\nwas diluted to a Htc of 0.5% and for the channels seeded with HMEC-1, blood \n\nwas diluted to 1% Hct. The biochip was then fed on one side by the diluted blood \n\nsample and aspirated on the other side by the sensor-controlled microfluidic \n\nsyringe pump system. Each patient sample has been run in duplicate for the two \n\ncell adhesion conditions at six different and progressively higher rates (0.5, 1, 2, \n\n3, 5 and 7 dyne/cm2), according to the program shown in Figure 1. Such program \n\nconsisted of two steps: 1st) Perfusion, in which red blood cells flow remained at \n\n0.5 dyne/cm2 for 15 minutes and 2nd) Wash, in which the other mentioned speeds \n\nwere applied for 5 minutes each. A photograph was recorded at each speed \n\nadopted, in six representative areas along the biochip channel, by using \n\nAxioVision\u2122 software (Carl Zeiss\u00ae, Jena, Germany) so that adhered cells to \n\nlaminin or to HMEC-1 endothelial cells could be quantified later with the aid of the \n\nsame software. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n28 \n\nFigura 1. Cell Adhesion Assay curve. Illustration of the adopted program for the collected blood \nsamples, consisting of two steps: 1) Perfusion - 0.5 dyne / cm2 for 15 minutes and 2) Wash - \nsuccessive increase of speed every 5 minutes at flow rates 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 dynes / cm2. Axis x \nrepresents the time, in minutes.  \n \n\n4.8. Statistical analysis \n\n Statistical analysis was performed using GraPhpad Prism version 7.00 \n\nsoftware (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA). For evaluation of the proportional \n\nrelation between the percentage of pitted cells, cells with HJB and patients age, \n\nSpearman's non-parametric linear correlation test has been applied. Evaluation \n\nof median between the compared conditions and the calculation of the descriptive \n\nstatistics, containing the subjects hemolysis data, have been performed by \n\napplying the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and data are expressed as \n\n[Median \u00b1 (Interquartile Interval)]. Also, the former test was used for further \n\nquantitative analysis. Findings obtained for the Immunophenotypic Assay are \n\nshown as percentage and MFI expression. Cell Adhesion Assay contains data \n\nexpressed as adherent RBCs/mm2. Differences have been considered significant \n\nwhen p<0.05. \n\n \n\nPerfusion Wash \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n29 \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n30 \n\n5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n5.1. Splenic function quantification \n\n5.1.1 Splenic function quantification in SCA children between 6 to 29 \n\nmonths \n\n HJB and vacuoles on the red blood cell surface (PIT) are known cellular \n\ncharacteristics that make it possible to evaluate the filtering and cleaning function \n\nof old or defective circulating cells performed by the spleen. Literature findings \n\nindicate that a percentage greater than or equal to 3.5% of pitted cells is indicative \n\nof splenic dysfunction (Pearson, et al., 1985). In its turn, values higher than 0.03% \n\nof cells containing HJB corpuscles were associated with loss of splenic filtration \n\nfunction (Rogers et al., 2011). \n\n In the present study, the follow-up study of the pitted cells percentage (r = \n\n0.6, p = 0.006) and those with HJB (r = 0.5, p = 0.01) showed that the splenic \n\nfunction slightly decreased as the first months of life passed in the SCA group \n\nwith patients between 6 and 29 months of life (Figure 2).  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n31 \n\nFigure 2.

Splenic function quantification in SCA subjects from 3 years of life \n\non and in HS subjects \n\n When the aforementioned SCA group with individuals up to 29 months of \n\nage was compared to SCA patients 3 years old or older, there was a significant \n\ndecrease in splenic function in the last group (PIT: r = 0.8, p&lt;0, 0001 and HJB: r \n\n= 0.7, p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 3A-B). Still, HJB counting and PIT counting correlation \n\nwas significant (r = 0.5; p = 0.001) (Figure 3C). Also, there was a significant \n\ncorrelation between HJB counts and PIT counts (r = 0.5; p = 0.001) in SCA \n\npatients 3 years old or older, in accordance with previous findings (Corazza, et \n\nal., 1990). \n\n \n\n0 10 20 30 40\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nAge (months)\n\nH\nJB\n\n (%\n)\n\n18-21\n22-29\n\n6-9\n\n14-17\n10-13\n\nMonths:\nr = 0.5\np = 0.01\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nAge (months)\n\nP\nIT\n\n (\n%\n\n) 18-21\n22-29\n\n6-9\n\n14-17\n10-13\n\nr = 0.6\np = 0.006\n\nMonths: \n\n0.0 2.5 5.0 10 20 30 40\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nPIT (%)\n\nH\nJB\n\n (%\n) 18-21\n\n22-29\n\n6-9\n\n14-17\n10-13\n\nr = 0.3\nMonths: \n\np = 0.2\n\nA \n\nC \n\nB \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n32 \n\nFigure 3.

Markers of hemolysis and splenic function loss  \n\n Some clinical signs are also predictive of an anemic state and of splenic \n\nfunction loss, and are thus considered markers of hemolysis (Zago, et al., 2013). \n\n As shown in Table 1, of the hemolysis markers compiled in this study, \n\nlevels of indirect bilirubin [1.61 (1.15 - 3.5) mg / dL; p = 0.01] and platelets [484 \n\n(411.5-706.5) x 103 / ?l; p &lt;0.03) were higher in asplenic SCA patients in \n\ncomparison to subjects with preserved splenic function [1.02 (0.5 - 1.5) mg / dL; \n\np = 0.01] and [387.5 (324.5 - 462.5) x 103 / ?L; p &lt;0.03], respectively. On the \n\nother hand, despite the important function of the spleen in cleaning defective \n\ncirculating cells, splenectomy in HS patients, as a general rule, decreases the \n\nlevels of some important markers of hemolysis in the circulation, improving \n\ncertain pathophysiological aspects of the disease (An and Mohandas, 2008).

In fact, PIT counting represent a more sensitive method for \n\nevaluation of splenic function (Corazza, et al., 1990). Thus, the study objective in \n\nthis new phase was to investigate whether the splenic function loss would be \n\ncorrelated with the increase of circulating adhesive reticulocytes and erythrocytes \n\nin SCA and HS patient samples. \n\n The immunophenotypic expression analysis in this study used 11 surface \n\nmarkers normally adopted to characterize reticulocytes and red blood cells \n\nregarding their adhesive profile.

Besides \n\nthat, CD242, CD99 and CD108 also stood out in frequency on both RBCs \n\npopulation surface (Figure 18A-B top). There was also an increased MFI \n\nexpression of CD44+ reticulocytes (Figure 18C top).  \n\n On the other hand, reticulocytes LuBCAM+ and CD36+ were in lower \n\nfrequency and showed decreased MFI expression in HS splenectomized patients \n\ncompared to those ones with spleen (Figure 18A and C bottom), although the \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n50 \n\nfrequency of CD108 positive erythrocytes was higher in the first HS group \n\nmentioned (Figure 18B bottom). \n\n In a nutshell, data obtained when comparing the spleen absence/presence \n\nin the two Hemolytic Anemias evaluated indicated that CD147, LuBCAM and \n\nCD58 are noteworthy adhesive markers in SCA pathophysiology. Regarding HS \n\ndisease, there was a low adhesion marker expression pattern on both RBCs \n\npopulation in general. LuBCAM and CD36 were especially in significant lower \n\nfrequency on reticulocytes surface of splenectomized individuals.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 18.

Disease type comparison \n\n The next study approach took into account the type of disease, considering \n\nthat, on one hand, the diseases evaluated in this study present different \n\npathophysiology, but on the other hand, they share similarities as they are both \n\nHereditary Hemolytic Anemias.  \n\n Analysis of the SCA and HS samples from patients with spleen has shown \n\nthat reticulocytes and erythrocytes LUBCAM+ were more frequent and showed \n\nhigher MFI expression in HS samples with spleen than the SCA samples in the \n\nsame condition (Figure 19A-D top). Likewise, reticulocytes and erythrocytes \n\npositive for CD44 and CD58 were presented in higher frequency in HS blood with \n\nspleen than in those SCA ones. Although, in the presence of the spleen, HS \n\npatients present a higher percentage of circulating cells positive for LuBCAM, \n\nCD44 and CD58 than SCA patients in the same condition, the frequency of these \n\ntwo adhesive populations of RBCs is high in patients with both diseases, of 40%, \n\nor higher as shown in Figure 19A-B top. In contrast, CD36, CD242 and CD49d \n\npositive SCA reticulocytes were seen in higher percentages and with more \n\nsurface epitopes expressed than in HS, in the presence of spleen (Figure 19A \n\nand C top). These findings show that the pattern of adhesive phenotype of \n\npatients with spleen in these two hemolytic anemias is variable, which highlights \n\nthe importance of the intrinsic pathophysiologies of each illness. \n\n By analyzing the adhesive phenotypic pattern between SCA and HS \n\npatients without spleen, it has been found that after the splenic function loss, \n\nreticulocytes from SCA patients presented significant higher amount of positive \n\ncirculating adhesive cells for the adhesion markers CD147, LuBCAM and CD36, \n\nas well as higher MFI expression of the same markers when compared to HS \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n53 \n\nsplenectomized patients (Figure 19A-C bottom). Still, SCA samples have also \n\nshown higher frequency of circulating reticulocytes for the markers CD99, CD49d \n\nand CD242 in relation to HS patients splenectomized (Figure 19A bottom). \n\nFocusing on the erythrocytes population in the SCA group without splenic \n\nfunction, we also detected a higher frequency of such cells positive for CD147 \n\nand CD242 (Figure 19B bottom), although the expression of the surface epitopes \n\n(MFI) did not differ in relation to the HS group in the same condition (Figure 19D \n\nbottom). \n\n Together, the data have shown that, in the presence of spleen, HS patients \n\npresented higher frequency of adhesive circulating RBCs and higher intensity of \n\nexpression of the corresponding molecules than the SCA subjects. However, \n\nonce devoid of splenic function, SCA patients demonstrated greater adhesion \n\nmolecules expression in RBCs, especially in reticulocytes, along with their \n\nincreased MFI expression, in comparison to the HS group. \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n54 \n\nFigure 19.

Cellular adhesion ability   \n\n After the immunophenotypic profile analysis of reticulocytes and \n\nerythrocytes from patients affected by SCA and HS, we have undertaken the \n\nanalysis of these cells effective adhesive potential. To do so, we have performed \n\na cellular adhesion assay at an in vitro Platform that allows studies on cell-cell \n\ninteraction (with prior cellular or non-cellular activation) or on cell-proteins of \n\ninterest in adhesion, migration, transmigration, and other assays (Rainger et al., \n\n1995, Gauthier et al., 2010, Munir H et al., 2015). \n\n In the present work, the above-mentioned Platform has allowed us to \n\nevaluate the adhesion abilities of red cells to endothelial cells (HMEC-1 lineage) \n\nand to laminin, an abundant multiadhesive glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix \n\nessential in cellular adhesion processes and several others (Lodish et al., 2002).  \n\n  Again, two types of comparison were established. In the first one, we \n\naimed to evaluate possible differences within the two diseases studied under the \n\nspleen presence/absence condition. The second analysis compared the cellular \n\nadhesive performance between the diseases under the same condition, that is, \n\nboth with preserved splenic function or both without it. \n\n \n\n5.3.1 Spleen absence/presence comparison \n\n When SCA samples without preserved splenic function were compared to \n\nSCA with it, the first group\u2019s RBCs presented significant increase in adhesiveness \n\nto laminin in all the six flow speeds applied (Figure 20A). However, not only the \n\noverall adhesive ability to HMEC-1 was considerably inferior than the one \n\ndetected against laminin, but also there was no difference between the RBCs \n\nquantification of SCA subjects before and after the splenic function loss (Figure \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n56 \n\nB). But then, when quantified RBCs that were adhered to HMEC-1 were \n\nsubdivided into reticulocytes and erythrocytes, significant higher adhesiveness \n\nwas observed in SCA reticulocytes from individuals without preserved splenic \n\nfunction compared to those with spleen at the rate of 1 dyne/cm2, which mimics \n\nthe closest blood flow speed in vivo (Figure 20C). Noteworthy, of all the RBCs \n\nadhered to HMEC-1 lineage, most of them were composed of erythrocytes, but \n\nno difference was observed regarding the erythrocytes adhesive ability to HMEC-\n\n1 (Figure 20D). Anyhow, reticulocytes and erythrocytes were resistant to wash-\n\noff by increasing shear stress and remained adhered until the last flow rate \n\napplied.   \n\n Regarding the spleen absence/presence analysis on the HS groups, there \n\nwas no significant difference between groups, although the adhesive potential of \n\nHS reticulocytes and erythrocytes has also shown resistance to wash-off at an \n\nincreasing shear stress in general, and, although adhesion to laminin has been \n\nvisually higher in the HS splenectomized group compared to the one with spleen \n\n(Figure 21A-B). Worthy of comment, the high variation of the standard deviation \n\nbars indicates the need of increasing the number of samples evaluated (n = 4), \n\nin order to improve the robustness of the analysis. \n\n Nevertheless, observing the subpopulations of HMEC-1 quantified, the \n\nadhesive reticulocytes from splenectomized HS patients were detected in higher \n\namount than the samples of HS subjects with spleen at the rate of 1 dyne/cm2 \n\nagain (Figure 21C). Still, of all the RBCs adhered to HMEC-1 lineage, most of \n\nthem were composed of erythrocytes again but the small amount of reticulocytes \n\nthat adhered couldn\u2019t resist the increasing shear stress washing imposed, unlike \n\nthe erythrocytes (Figure 21C-D).  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n57 \n\n In a summary, in the spleen absence condition, SCA RBCs exhibited \n\nhigher adhesive ability to laminin rather the corresponding group with preserved \n\nsplenic function. Moreover, it should be also pointed out the reticulocyte higher \n\nadhesive ability against HMEC-1 in both Hemolytic Anemias at a shear stress \n\nflow rate similar to the blood flow in vivo. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n58 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 20.

Disease type comparison \n\n Data obtained from the comparison of the disease type showed that once \n\nin the condition of spleen presence, SCA and HS samples did not differ in \n\nadhesiveness to laminin and to HMEC-1 (Figure 22A-B). However, the quantified \n\nreticulocyte subpopulation that adhered to HMEC-1 presented significant higher \n\nadhesive potencial in the SCA samples than in the corresponding HS group at \n\nlow shear stress rates (0.5 and 1 dynes/cm2) (Figure 22C).  \n\n Lastly, after splenic function loss, SCA and HS cells showed no significant \n\ndifference in adhesiveness against laminin (Figure 23A), although SCA samples \n\ntended visually to show a more adhesive pattern than HS cells. This event may \n\nhave happened due to the high variation observed by the standard deviation bars \n\nwhich makes it important to reiterate the need of increasing the number of HS \n\nsamples (n = 4) evaluated in order to obtain more representative outcome. \n\n Focusing on the analysis of RBCs to HMEC-1 adhesive ability, the overall \n\nquantification showed higher adhesiveness of RBCs only at 5 dynes/cm2, a high \n\nflow rate. But then, the observation of reticulocytes and erythrocytes \n\nsubquantification revealed that SCA reticulocytes were more adhesive to HMEC-\n\n1 in almost all the shear stress flow rates applied (0.5, 2, 3, 5 and 7 dynes/cm2), \n\nunlike the lack of singnificant difference in the adhesive potential between the \n\ngroups\u2019 erythrocytes against HMEC-1 (Figure 23D). \n\n Together, these findings show that reticulocytes may present a higher \n\nadhesive potential against endothelial cells in SCA individuals than in HS \n\npatients, in both conditions, either with or without the spleen. Data also showed \n\nthat, in general, RBCs had a greater adhesive binding to laminin than to HMEC-\n\n1 lineage. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n61 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 22.

CONCLUSION \n\n - Splenic function quantification presented a slight decrease with aging in \n\nthe first months of life (6 to 29 months). However, from 3 years of life on splenic \n\nfunction significantly decreased with aging in patients with SCA; \n\n - Immunophenotypic findings showed that, in general, the more advanced \n\nthe splenic function loss (higher PIT count) was, the more frequent in circulation \n\nRBCs positive for the erythrocytes markers CD147, LuBCAM and CD58 were in \n\nSCA samples. \n\n - Spleen absense played a notable role in the increase of reticulocytes and \n\nerythrocytes adhesion expression in SCA, although it led to decrease of cell \n\nadhesion expression pattern in splenectomized HS patients. CD147, LuBCAM \n\nand CD58 positive reticulocytes and erythrocytes adhesion expression stood out \n\nin SCA patients without splenic function. \n\n - Regarding the disease type comparison, HS patients with spleen \n\npresented higher frequency of cell adhesion expression. However, SCA samples \n\nwithout splenic function showed remarkable greater cell adhesion expression in \n\ncomparison to HS splenectomized individuals. LuBCAM, CD44 and CD58 \n\npositive reticulocytes and erythrocytes adhesion expression was noteworthy in \n\nHS patients with splenic function, although CD36, CD242 and CD49d positive \n\nreticulocytes expression was higher in SCA with and without spleen. \n\n - Focusing on the adhesion ability assay, in the spleen absence, SCA \n\nRBCs exhibited higher adhesive ability to laminin than the SCA RBCs with \n\npreserved splenic function. Reticulocytes of patients without spleen presented \n\nhigher adhesiveness against HMEC-1 at low shear stress (1 dyne/cm2) in both \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n65 \n\nHemolytic Anemias, considering the due proportions of being in much larger \n\nnumbers in SCA patients. \n\n - Furthermore, disease type comparison in the adhesion assay detected \n\nthat reticulocytes presented a higher adhesive potential against endothelial cells \n\nin SCA individuals than in HS patients, either with or without spleen. Data also \n\nshowed that, RBCs had a greater adhesive binding to laminin than to HMEC-1. \n\n Together, our results indicate that although both diseases belong to the to \n\nHemolytic Anemias group that encompasses RBCs intrinsic defects, SCA and \n\nHS distinct pathophysiologies and clinical evolution lead to different \n\nimmunophenotypic patterns of cell adhesion expression. In SCA, the absence of \n\nsplenic function may have a direct relation with the increase of SCA RBCs pro-\n\nadhesive phenotype and adhesiveness, which brings serious clinical \n\nconsequences to the patients, whereas in HS without spleen, in general, cellular \n\nadhesion events are minimized, although they still present adhesive circulating \n\nreticulocytes and erythrocytes after splenectomy. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n66 \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n67 \n\n7.

APPENDICES \n \n8.1. Appendix I \u2013 Informed consent form for the collection and use of \nbiological material \n \nResearch Name: Splenic function and cellular adhesion events in Sickle Cell \nAnemia and in Hereditary Spherocytosis. \n\nResearchers in charge: MSc Priscilla Carnavale Gomes Ferreira, PhD Ana \nCristina Silva Pinto and PhD Dimas Tadeu Covas. \n\n \n\n We would like to invite you to participate in this research project. This \n\ninvitation is being made to a number of patients with Sickle Cell Anemia and with \n\nHereditary Spherocytosis that undergo the clinical follow-up in the \n\nHemoglobinopathies clinic at the Clinical Hospital (HC) of the Ribeir\u00e3o Preto \n\nMedical School of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (FMRP-USP). \n\n Participation is voluntary. To take part in the study, it is necessary to read \nthis document carefully and listen to our explanations in case of doubts. If you \n\nare interested in participating, we will ask you to sign this document. \n\n \n\nWhy will this research be performed? \n  \n\n Sickle Cell Anemia and Hereditary Spherocytosis represent a major health \n\nproblem in Brazil. They are hereditary diseases and therefore have no cure. The \n\nproduction of blood in our body occurs in the bone marrow. In certain special \n\nareas of the bone marrow, called erythroblastoid islands, there are important \n\ncells, called macrophages, responsible for making our red blood cells mature to \n\ncirculate in blood vessels. \n\n The spleen is an organ that has the important function of destroying the \n\ncirculating old red blood cells, besides contributing also to the maturation of the \n\nred blood cells under specific conditions. \n\n In patients with sickle cell disease and other Hemolytic Anemias, such as \n\nHereditary Spherocytosis, the circulating blood cells, called reticulocytes, are \n\nimmature and adhere abnormally to blood vessels, which leads to several serious \n\nside effects in patients. In this context, the spleen plays a fundamental role in the \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n73 \n\nclearence of these abnormal cells, which gradually becomes overloaded and \n\nmight eventually lose its function. \n\n The purpose of our research is to investigate the role of the spleen in \n\npatients with Sickle Cell Anemia and Hereditary Spherocytosis with and without \n\npreserved splenic function in relation to the adhesive characteristic of \n\nreticulocytes and erythrocytes. \n\n \nWhy is your participation important? \n \n\n For performing the research, it is necessary to analyze the blood of the \n\npatients with Sickle Cell Anemia and with Hereditary Spherocytosis and to \n\ncompare them with the parameters that we intend to investigate. \n\n This comparison serves to observe the real importance of the spleen in \n\nthe clearance process of old and/or defective red blood cells, in the maturation of \n\nred blood cells and in the clinical evolution of the patient in general. \n\n \n\nHow will this research be conducted? \n \n\n After you have agreed to participate in the study and have signed this \n\nConsent Form, we will collect a blood sample from your vein/your dependent's \n\nvein. For children with Sickle Cell Anemia, 5 blood collections (one collection \n\neach 3 months for a period of 1 year) will be required. For adults with Sickle Cell \n\nAnemia and for patients with Hereditary Spherocytosis, only one collection will be \n\nperformed. \n\n The collection of peripheral blood will be done by vein puncture of the arm \n\nafter asepsis of the skin by the Hemocentro of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto nursing team on \n\nthe day of your return to the clinic. In addition, relevant clinical data will be \n\nextracted from your medical record in a second moment, preserving the \n\nconfidentiality of it. \n\n \n\nHow long will the research last? \n It will take the total of 3 years to complete the research and it may be \n\nnecessary to collect new blood samples if the first one is not enough. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n74 \n\nWhat risks can occur? \n Risks that may occur are: bruising at the site of venous punctures, pain \n\nand, more rarely, infection at the venipuncture site. \n\n \n\nWhat happens if you do not agree to participate? \n \n\n If you do not want to participate, your follow-up assistence in our clinic will \n\ncontinue the same, without any interference on your treatment. \n\n \n\nAre there any expenses or benefits in this study? \n \n\n There will be no expense and no cash gain. The only benefit will be to help \n\nus better understand the function of the spleen in your disease. \n\n We affirm that all the data obtained will be kept in a confidential way and \n\nthat the names of the participants will not be disclosed at any time. \n\n For any questions about this research, get in touch with MSc. Priscilla \n\nCarnavale Gomes Ferreira by the telephone: (16) 2101-9300, extension: 9699. \n \nI, _____________________________________________________________, \n\nID_________________________, nationality ________________, years _____, \n\nmarital status ____________________, occupation ________________, \n\naddress_________________________________________________________ \n\nauthorize the collection of 10 mL (one tablespoon) of my blood / my \n\ndependente/\u2019s blood, by venous puncture for research purposes on spleen \n\nfunction and cellular adhesion events in Sickle Cell Anemia and Hereditary \n\nSpherocytosis.
