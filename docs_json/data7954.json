The thermal radiation computation in participating gases, such as\n\nH2O and CO2, is a complex task due to the strong dependence of its radiative properties\n\non the wavenumber. The `exact' Line-by-Line (LBL) calculation is the most accurate\n\nalternative. However, this methodology requires a very expensive computational e?ort,\n\nwhich is not feasible for practical engineering problems solution. Global Models such\n\nas the Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (WSGG) and the Spectral-Line Weighted-Sum-of-\n\nGray-Gases (SLW) are promising alternatives. The WSGG model, despite its relatively\n\nsimple formulation, has provided results near to LBL integration as well as the SLW\n\nmodel, often recognized as a WSGG model improvement. Thus, in this work a compar-\n\nison between the accuracy of the WSGG and SLW models was made. Therefore, were\n\nobtained solutions for H2O, CO2, and H2O/CO2 mixtures in non-isothermal homoge-\n\nneous and non-homogeneous media. For mixtures, in the WSGG model was also used\n\nthe superposition method, which makes part of SLW mixture modeling. The superposi-\n\ntion approach arises as an alternative to non-homogeneous media treatment. However,\n\nthe challenge of this approach is the combination of participating gases since it requires\n\nincreasing computational e?ort as the components number increase. Thereby, this work\n\nproposes and applies a reduced superposition method for the WSGG model aiming for\n\ncomputational time reduction. In addition, the consistency of this proposition is also\n\nveri?ed in di?usion ?ames. The results show that the WSGG model can lead to results\n\nas good as those of SLW depending on the problem under analysis. Further, the reduced\n\nsuperposition method provided accuracy very near to that of the standard superposition\n\nmethod.\n\nKeywords: Thermal Radiation; WSGG Model; SLW Model; LBL; Superposition

In com-\n\nbustion systems, for instance, the participating gases temperature may reach above 2500\n\nK. In such conditions, the thermal radiation is the prevalent heat transfer mechanism. De-\n\nspite this fact, the accurate thermal radiation modeling in combustion systems has being\n\nignored in many cases and treated with simplistic optically thin and gray models [Modest\n\nand Haworth, 2016]. The main reason for that may be the di?culty of including accurate\n\nradiative transfer calculation in problems already complex. However, simply neglecting\n\nthe thermal radiation in atmospheric pressure combustion systems may overpredict the\n\ntemperature up to 200 ?C, while using the optically thin or gray radiation models un-\n\nderpredict up to 100 ?C [Modest and Haworth, 2016]. Due to this, many works have\n\nbeen developed presenting di?erent methodologies for the thermal radiation modeling in\n\nparticipating gases, as will be described in Chapter 2.\n\nIn participating media, when a gas molecule absorbs or emits radiative energy,\n\nthe vibrational and/or rotational energies of the molecule are raised or lowered. These\n\nenergy levels lead to many thousands of discrete spectral lines, forming so-called vibra-\n\ntion?rotation bands. The photon energy needed to the transition levels are a?ected by\n\nsome physical mechanisms which makes the line to be broadened. The main mechanisms\n\nare the molecular collisions and the molecular movement (Doppler e?ect). In a certain\n\nspectral location, a spectral line is described by its strength and its line width. These\n\ninformations are found in conceited databases, such as HITRAN and HITEMP. In these\n\ndatabases is also found the information of how to calculate the resulting absorption co-\n\ne?cient, necessary in the radiative transfer equation (RTE) solution. The absorption\n\ncoe?cient is characterized by thousands of absorption lines having a very erratic behavior\n\nwith wavenumber, which makes the analysis complicated. Such behavior is illustrated in\n\nFigure 1.1, where the spectral absorption coe?cient, ??, is plotted against the wavenum-\n\nber ? for a small concentration of H2O (YH2O = 0.01), at a temperature of 1500 K and\n\ntotal pressure of 1 atm. There are some approaches focused on capturing this spectral\n\ndependence of the absorption coe?cient. The Line-by-Line (LBL) spectral integration\n\nsolve the RTE for wavenumber intervals small enough to capture the data exactly. The\n\nchallenge of this method is the high computational time needed in this calculation. On the\n\n\n\n2\n\nother hand, the gray approach removes the spectral dependence of the absorption coe?-\n\ncient by calculating an average value for all wavenumbers. Despite the less computational\n\ne?ort required, this approach lead to elevated errors.\n\nFigure 1.1 ? The absorption coe?cient, ??, as a function of wavenumber ?, for H2O at T\n\n= 1500 K, p = 1 atm, YH2O = 0.01, and for wavenumbers ranging from 0 to 10,000 cm\n?1\n\n[Pearson, 2013].\n\nBetween these two extremists approaches there are the Global Models. These meth-\n\nods propose a integration scheme over the absorption coe?cient rather than wavenumber.\n\nThus, it renders fewer than 20 RTE integrations with an accuracy near to that of LBL.\n\nThe WSGG and the SLW models are among the most promising Global Models. The\n\nWSGG model, initially developed by Hottel and Saro?m, 1967, in despite of its simple\n\nformulation yields satisfactory accuracy, solving the RTE with a summation over just\n\n3 or 4 gray gases instead of spectral integration. While the SLW model [Denison and\n\nWebb, 1993b] was developed in 1990's, and has received several improvements since its\n\ninitial proposition for the treatment of non-isothermal and/or non-homogeneous media.\n\nTherefore, this model is more sophisticated than WSGG, utilizing 10 or even 20 gray\n\ngases. For participating gases mixtures, the limitation of WSGG is that its correlations\n\nare given for constant partial pressure ratio between the species in non-homogeneous me-\n\ndia. This problem is removed with the superposition method [Cassol et al., 2014], based\n\n\n\n3\n\non individual gases correlations, which also makes part of SLW mixture formulation. Even\n\nthough the SLW model be considered an improvement of WSGG, the di?erence between\n\nthe solutions of these models may not be substantial depending on the case under anal-\n\nysis. Furthermore, one important issue of the superposition method is that the number\n\nof times that the RTE must be solved increases signi?cantly as the species number also\n\nincreases.\n\n1.1 Objectives of the study\n\nThe general objective of this study is to apply the WSGG and SLW models for\n\nradiative transfer prediction in participating media. From that, the following speci?c\n\nobjectives can be de?ned:\n\n\u2022 Compute the thermal radiation in non-isothermal homogeneous and non-homogeneous\n\nmedia using both WSGG and SLW models. The results will be compared against\n\nLBL benchmark solutions in order to verify the accuracy of these models. The\n\nproblems will be solved for H2O and CO2 individually, and for H2O/CO2 mixtures,\n\nconsidering di?erent pro?les of temperature and molar concentration of the species.\n\nFor mixtures, the superposition method will be applied to the WSGG to do an\n\nadequate comparison with SLW solution;\n\n\u2022 Proposition and application of a reduced superposition method in the WSGG model,\n\naiming at a computational time reduction. In the superposition method the num-\n\nber of times that the RTE must be solved is expressively raised as the participating\n\nspecies number increases. In combustion systems where the radiative transfer cal-\n\nculation is only part of a complex problem, which includes chemical kinetic and\n\nturbulence modeling, any computational time reduction is very important.\n\n\u2022 Verify the consistency of the reduced superposition method in di?usion ?ames.\n\n1.2 Organization of the Work\n\nChapter 2 will present a literature review for the main methods developed for\n\nspectral integration of the RTE. Chapter 3 will provide a description of the thermal\n\nradiation fundamental relevant for this work, focusing on those important for the de?nition\n\n\n\n4\n\nand solution of the RTE. The detailed description of the spectral integration methods used\n\nin this study will be shown in Chapter 4. A new approach for the superposition method\n\napplied to the WSGG model will be described in Chapter 5. This proposition aims at the\n\ncomputational e?ort reduction. Chapter 6 will show the application of WSGG and SLW\n\nmodels for the radiative transfer prediction in participating media. The validation of the\n\nnew approach for the superposition method will also be presented. Chapter 7 will give\n\nconclusions and perspectives for future works. Some results of the radiative transfer from\n\nparticipating gases are also included in the appendices.\n\n\n\n5\n\n2 BIBLIOGRAPHY SURVEY\n\nAt high temperatures, thermal radiation can signi?cantly a?ect the heat transfer\n\ncharacteristics in media involving combustion products. However, the prediction of the\n\nradiative heat transfer is still a challenging task due to the strong spectral variation of the\n\nabsorption coe?cient of gases with the wavenumber. The line-by-line (LBL) integration\n\ncan provide a solution with high level of accuracy for this kind of problem, but, due to\n\nthe many thousands of absorption lines present in gases spectra, LBL calculations are\n\ncomputationally expensive [Denison and Webb, 1995a], which often makes the solution\n\nimpracticable. As an alternative to overcome this di?culty, some gas models have been\n\ndeveloped.\n\n2.1 Radiative Transfer Modeling\n\nThe Gray Gas (GG) model is the simplest method to predict the radiative heat\n\ntransfer in combustion systems and atmosphere processes. This approach consists in\n\nconsidering the radiative properties, as the absorption coe?cient, to be independent of\n\nthe wavenumber. Despite this unrealistic approximation for gases, the GG model is yet\n\nused in modern engineering problem solution [Xue et al., 2001; Al-Omari, 2006; Narayanan\n\nand Trouv\u00e9, 2009; Crnomarkovic et al., 2013] since it is of quite simple implementation if\n\ncompared to other spectral models. Besides that, studies have shown that the GG model\n\nleads to pool accuracy when the media is dominated by participating gases, and becomes\n\nmore accurate as the soot concentration increases [Mossi et al., 2012; Cassol et al., 2015].\n\nWhen there is a non-gray media, the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) solution\n\ncan be found by three groups of methods : Band Models, Global Models, and Line-by-line\n\n(LBL) method. In the LBL method the RTE integration is performed over the entire radi-\n\nation spectrum taking into account the contribution of each spectral line. This procedure\n\nrequires about 106 resolution of the RTE [Modest, 2003b], involving a lot of computa-\n\ntional e?ort that is not feasible for practical applications [Demarco, 2012]. However, this\n\nmethod is useful for providing benchmark solutions, and it has been used in a few works\n\nwhich solve two-dimensional problems [Mazumder and Modest, 2002; Modest and Zhang,\n\n2002; Zhang and Modest, 2002, 2003; Pal and Modest, 2010; Chu et al., 2012; Consalvi\n\nand Liu, 2014; Centeno et al., 2016].\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe Band Models (BM) consist of dividing the radiation spectrum into spectral\n\nintervals in which the radiative properties are considered constant, and are classi?ed in\n\nNarrow Band (NB) and Wide Band (WB) models. With the NB models is possible to re-\n\nplace the actual absorption coe?cient behavior by average values over narrow wavenumber\n\nintervals. In the WB models the integration is realized over larger wavenumber intervals\n\nconsidering that blackbody intensities do not vary substantially across bands. Despite\n\nbeing less computationally expansive, WB models does not achieve the same level of ac-\n\ncuracy as the NB models [Modest, 2003b]. The disadvantaged of Band Models is the\n\ndi?culty to be used in an arbitrary solution technique of the RTE, as the discrete or-\n\ndinates method (DOM), since they yield gas transmissivity (NB model) or absorptance\n\n(WB model) instead of absorption coe?cient. One alternative to overcome such issue is\n\nto implement the band models through the correlated-k (CK) methodology to acquire\n\nabsorption coe?cients [Liu and Smallwood, 2004]. In the BM are included the Statistical\n\nNarrow Band (SNB) [Goody, 1952], SNB based on CK (SNBCK) [Liu and Smallwood,\n\n2004], Exponential Wide Band (EWB) [Edwards and Balakrishnan, 1973], and Wide Band\n\nbased on CK (WBCK) [\u00c7ayan and Sel\u00e7uk, 2007] models. In the absence of the LBL calcu-\n\nlation due to its excessive computing time, the SNB model is used as benchmark solution\n\nfor gas radiation transfer problems [Bresslo?, 1999; Goutiere et al., 2000; Coelho, 2002;\n\nDemarco et al., 2011].\n\nGlobal Models propose an integration scheme over the absorption coe?cient rather\n\nthan wavenumber. This engineering approach typically renders fewer than 20 integrations\n\nof the RTE for prediction of total quantities such as radiative ?ux and net ?ux divergence,\n\nwhile the LBL method requires millions of times, which is prohibitively expensive. One\n\npopular Global Model is the Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (WSGG), initially developed\n\nby Hottel and Saro?m, 1967. The approach of this model replaces the integration of\n\nspectral properties with a summation over a small set of gray gases (often three or four)\n\nplus the spectral window to simulate the properties of the non-gray gas. These gray gases\n\nreplace the real spectrum behavior, and it is considered that each of them has uniform\n\nabsorption coe?cient and a temperature coe?cient which correspond to the fraction of\n\nblackbody energy emitted in the spectral region that represent each gray gas location.\n\nThe coe?cients of such gray gases in the WSGG model can be determined from ?tting\n\ndata of total emittance computed, for instance, from LBL calculations of high-resolution\n\n\n\n7\n\nspectral absorption coe?cient. Smith et al., 1982 present these coe?cients obtained from\n\ninterpolation of experimental data. However, such coe?cients are limited to H2O/CO2\n\nmixture with uniform concentration, and they can generate elevated errors in the solution\n\nwhen compared to problems that use modern spectral data [Maurente et al., 2008; Mossi\n\net al., 2012]. Despite this, such correlations are still used in contemporary studies [Trivic,\n\n2014] and in commercial software of computational ?uid dynamics as the ANSYS/Fluent\n\n[Fluent, 2018].\n\nNonetheless, few studies have focused on generate new WSGG correlations for\n\nH2O/CO2 mixtures [Kangwanpongpan et al., 2012; Dorigon et al., 2013], and for individ-\n\nual species such as carbon monoxide (CO) [Ziemniczak et al., 2015; Brittes et al., 2017].\n\nAlthough the correlations are, often, obtained for a wide temperature range, the partial\n\npressure ratio between the species is maintained constant. For this reason, Johansson\n\net al., 2011 proposed a WSGG modi?cation to consider partial pressure ratio between\n\nH2O and CO2 varying from 0.125 to 2.\n\nBesides having a relatively simple formulation, the WSGG model does not require\n\nthe knowledge of spectral data banks, and was demonstrated by Modest, 1991 that this\n\nmodel can be applied with arbitrary RTE methods of solution since the media is non-\n\nscattering with a black-walled enclosure. However, Modest and Zhang, 2000 showed that\n\nthese restrictions can be disregarded. Thereby, the WSGG methodology is adopted in\n\nseveral problems solution as those of oxi-combustion [Becher et al., 2012; Rajhi et al.,\n\n2014; Garten et al., 2015], one-dimensional [Dorigon et al., 2013; Fonseca and Fran\u00e7a,\n\n2015; Ziemniczak et al., 2015; Brittes et al., 2017; Fonseca et al., 2018], two-dimensional\n\n[Silva et al., 2007; Centeno et al., 2013; Crnomarkovic et al., 2013; Centeno et al., 2014;\n\nGarten et al., 2015; Centeno et al., 2016], and three-dimensional problems [Coelho, 2002;\n\nTrivic, 2014; Bhuiyan and Naser, 2015; G.Clements et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Fraga\n\net al., 2017], as well as in the Turbulence-Radiation-Iterations (TRI) modeling [Silva et al.,\n\n2007; Krishnamoorthy, 2010; Coelho, 2012; Centeno et al., 2014; Shiehnejadhesar et al.,\n\n2014; Centeno et al., 2016; Fraga et al., 2017].\n\nAlthough the standard WSGG model be widely used in engineering computations\n\nof radiative heat transfer in participating media, it is limited to the gas mixtures where the\n\nmole ratio between the species is constant. As a way to eliminate this restriction, Cassol\n\net al., 2014 applied the superposition methodology [Smith et al., 1987] to the WSGG\n\n\n\n8\n\nmodel for H2O, CO2, and soot mixtures . This approach consists on ?rst setting up\n\nindependent correlations for each species, which are then superposed to form the WSGG\n\ncorrelations for the mixture. Thus, it is possible to compute the radiative heat transfer\n\nin mixtures with arbitrary concentrations, allowing for local variations in the mole ratios,\n\nand the inclusion of any number of participating species.\n\nBased on these advantages, a few works have been done on which is used the\n\nWSGG model with the superposition approach. Centeno et al., 2016 studied the e?ect\n\nof soot on the radiative heat transfer in a turbulent, non-premixed methane?air ?ame\n\ninside a combustion chamber. It was shown that the superposition of the correlations\n\nof H2O/CO2 mixtures and soot in the WSGG model provides results of good agreement\n\nwith the LBL benchmark solution. The TRI phenomena in the context of a non-reactive\n\n3-D channel ?ow of a high temperature homogeneous participating gas was successfully\n\nmodeled using the WSGG model with the superposition method [Fraga et al., 2017].\n\nAnother recent paper also explored this approaching in the computation of the radiative\n\nheat transfer in an axisymmetric gas system composed of H2O, CO2, and soot [Centeno\n\net al., 2018]. This study showed that the superposition method between the coe?cients of\n\nthe individual species led to the least accurate results, while the WSGG model considering\n\nthe superposition between the H2O/CO2 mixture and soot coe?cients proved the best\n\nalternative for both moderate and high concentrations of soot.\n\nAnother prominent Global Model that also uses the superposition method is the\n\nSpectral-Line Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (SLW) ?rst introduced by Denison and Webb,\n\n1993b. The fundamental component of this model is the absorption line blackbody dis-\n\ntribution function (ALBDF). For a given gas temperature, the ALBDF is the fraction of\n\nthe blackbody energy in the portions of the spectrum where the spectral absorption cross-\n\nsection of the gas is less than a prescribed value. The ALBDF is used for temperature\n\ncoe?cient calculation of each gray gas in the RTE solution. This function is generated\n\nwith a detailed spectral data available in databases as the HITRAN and HITEMP. Since\n\nthis procedure spend much computational time, empirical correlations for ALBDF of\n\nH2O [Denison and Webb, 1993a], and CO2 [Denison and Webb, 1995a] were developed in\n\na form of a hyperbolic tangent function. Radiative transfer model parameters for carbon\n\nmonoxide (CO) were also proposed [Solovjov and Webb, 1998].\n\nNew ALBDF correlations for H2O, CO2, and CO based on the updated HITEMP\n\n\n\n9\n\n2010 database were generated by Pearson et al., 2014b. In this study were considered\n\nvariable temperature, mole fraction, and total pressure. The LBL ALBDF was also com-\n\nputed and tabulated for discrete temperature, mole fractions, and total pressure ranging\n\nfrom 300 K to 3000 K, 0 to 1, and 0.1 atm to 50 atm, respectively. The correlation showed\n\nan accuracy that is quite adequate for engineering applications but considerably less accu-\n\nrate than the tabulated ALBDF. In spite of having an initial computational cost to read\n\nthe data, the inaccuracy of the tabulated ALBDF is only caused by interpolations used\n\nto obtain its values at speci?ed conditions [Pearson, 2013]. The e?ect of total pressure\n\non the ALBDF and radiative transfer in H2O, CO2, and CO was also recently analyzed\n\n[Pearson et al., 2014a].\n\nIn the non-isothermal and/or non-homogeneous media treatment, the Liebnitz rule\n\nleads to appearance of additional terms in the spectral integration of the RTE. This ren-\n\nders the analysis complicated, especially for multidimensional media, and alter the RTE\n\nstandard form of solution [Denison and Webb, 1993b]. As an alternative, two approaches\n\nhave been adopted to treat these terms in the SLW model. The ?rst is the reference\n\napproach which allows the Liebnitz terms to be canceled using a reference state [Denison\n\nand Webb, 1995c]. Since this method require the implicit calculation of a set of parame-\n\nters, the computational time can be expensive. The second approach suggests the simple\n\nneglect of these terms from the RTE [Solovjov and Webb, 2000], however this procedure\n\ncan yield signi?cant errors and less accuracy if compared with the reference approach\n\n[Pearson, 2013].\n\nFor the case of gas mixtures, some approaches have also been proposed. The dou-\n\nble integration and the convolution approaches were applied to radiative heat transfer\n\ncalculation in H2O/CO2 mixtures [Denison and Webb, 1995b]. The extension to multi-\n\ncomponent gas mixtures with the superposition and multiplication approaches, along with\n\na hybrid of the two, were also introduced [Solovjov and Webb, 2000]. The soot inclusion\n\nas a gas in the multiplication method was studied by Solovjov and Webb, 2001. A new\n\nmodel, named SLW-1, was introduced by Solovjov et al., 2011a for individual species and\n\nlatter for non-isothermal non-homogeneous gaseous mixture with soot [Solovjov et al.,\n\n2011b]. In this methodology, the problem is reduced to the simplest case of the SLW\n\nmodel with a single gray gas and a clear gas, providing the accuracy near that of the SLW\n\nmethod with a large number of gray gases.\n\n\n\n10\n\nAs the SLW model, the Full-Spectrum k-Distribution model (FSK) can be viewed\n\nas an improvement of the WSGG [Demarco, 2012]. In the FSK model, The RTE so-\n\nlution is given by a integration over a distribution function virtually identical to the\n\nALBDF developed by Denison and Webb, 1993a [Pearson, 2013]. Proposed by Modest\n\ne Zhang [Modest and Zhang, 2000, 2002], th FSK model has been implemented with\n\nboth correlated-k and scaled-k distribution methods. These methods are an approach\n\ndeveloped for non-homogeneous media treatment, while for homogeneous medium (i.e.,\n\nthe absorption coe?cient is not a function of spatial coordinate) with narrow spectral\n\nintervals (i.e., range over which the Planck's function is nearly constant) the absorption\n\ncoe?cient may be reordered into a monotonic k-distribution, which produces exact results\n\nin a small fraction of the time required for LBL calculations [Modest, 2003a; Modest and\n\nRiazzi, 2005]. The correlated-k method is based on the fact that inside a spectral band,\n\nwhich is su?ciently narrow to assume a constant Planck's function, the precise position\n\nof a spectral line is not important for spectral integration. In the scaled-k distribution\n\nthe spectral and spatial dependence of the absorption coe?cient are separately treated.\n\nThereby, the FSK model has been applied to radiative transfer prediction in non-\n\nhomogeneous gas mixtures [Modest and Zhang, 2002; Wang and Modest, 2005; Pal et al.,\n\n2008], nonhomogeneous gas-soot mixtures [Pal and Modest, 2010], and in multidimen-\n\nsional media [Modest and Zhang, 2002; Mazumder and Modest, 2002; Modest and Riazzi,\n\n2005; Ma et al., 2014]. Its relation with the SLW model is discussed by Solovjov and\n\nWebb, 2009, showing that these two models are equivalent when the number of gray gases\n\ntends to in?nity.\n\nThe concept of correlated spectrum [Modest, 2013], initially refereed as ideal spec-\n\ntrum by Denison and Webb, 1995c, has been recently applied to the SLW model. It\n\nestablishes a relation between absorption coe?cient at an arbitrary state and the absorp-\n\ntion coe?cient at some chosen reference state. An extension of this approach is the novel\n\nRank Correlated SLW (RC-SLW) model of gas radiation in non-uniform media developed\n\nby Solovjov et al., 2017. The approach of this model is remarkable by the fact that it does\n\nnot require the speci?cation of a reference gas thermodynamic state, and it preserves the\n\nemission term in the spectrally integrated RTE. Studies have shown that the RC-SLW\n\nmodel provides more accurate results than the original SLW model based on a reference\n\nstate [Solovjov et al., 2017; Andre et al., 2017]. The range of the ALBDF database has\n\n\n\n11\n\nalso been studied for the accurate radiative prediction in this model [Webb et al., 2018],\n\nand it is shown that good accuracy may be achieved by using the RC-SLW model with as\n\nfew as 3?5 gray gases. A more general assumption of rank correlated spectrum is given\n\nby the scaled spectrum assumption used for the Scaled SLW model proposition [Solovjov\n\net al., 2017, 2018].\n\nThe Absorption Distribution Function (ADF) model is another distinguished Global\n\nModel. Developed in the 1990's [Rivi\u00e8re et al., 1996], the ADF model is quite similar to\n\nthe SLW [Modest and Zhang, 2002; Pierrot et al., 1999a], di?ering only in the calculation\n\nof the gray gas temperature coe?cients. This method was extended to non-isothermal\n\nmedia by means of the absorption distribution function model proposition with ?ctitious\n\ngases (ADFFG) [Pierrot et al., 1999a]. For a non-isothermal medium, it was shown that\n\nthe ADF and SLW models lead to resemblant accuracy, and the ADFFG model proved to\n\nbe more accurate than these latest models, but requires greater computing time [Pierrot\n\net al., 1999b].\n\nInstead of the full-spectrum correlation techniques traditionally used (i.e., ideal\n\nbehavior of the spectrum), a new model, called Cumulative Wavenumber (CW), proposes\n\na local-spectrum correlation for the solution of the RTE in non-uniform media at high\n\ntemperature [Solovjov and Webb, 2002]. By means of the cumulative wavenumber (a new\n\ngas absorption spectral distribution function), this model introduces a local correction\n\nfactor to consider the spatial variation of species concentration and gas temperature cal-\n\nculated independently in each ?xed spectral interval. Thus, there is no Leibniz terms\n\nproduction in the RTE solution. This approach is an attempt to replace the scale ap-\n\nproximation. Despite providing good results for radiative heat transfer calculation, the\n\nCW model formulation do not satisfy the energy balance, presenting considerable error in\n\nthe radiative heat ?ux prediction, as shown by Galar\u00e7a et al., 2011. For this reason, the\n\nModi?ed CW (MCW) model was developed [Galar\u00e7a et al., 2011] to satisfy the energy\n\nbalance while keeping the same value of the radiative volumetric heat source. The MCW\n\nmodel demonstrated to be more accurate than CW, however, spends much computational\n\ntime, that can not be practical to be coupled with combustion problems.\n\nSome CW model applications for radiative transfer calculation in participating\n\ngases have been accomplished. This model has been extended to non-uniform gas mixtures\n\nwith soot [Solovjov and Webb, 2005], and to account for non-gray walls [Solovjov et al.,\n\n\n\n12\n\n2013]. A fast approach was applied to reduce the computational cost [Salinas, 2008],\n\nand two-dimensional problems were also studied [Ismail and Salinas, 2005; Salinas, 2008].\n\nThe multilayer approach was used to modeling non-isothermal gaseous medium by SLW\n\nand CW models [Solovjov and Webb, 2008]. In this methodology the non-isothermal\n\nmedia is modeled by a system of isotherm layers, and, thus, the intervals of spectral\n\nintegration do not vary with spatial coordinate within the layers. Hence, the Leibnitz\n\nterms are eliminated in the spectral integration of the RTE, but the spectral integration\n\nin the interface between the layers requires special consideration for the consistency of\n\nthe model radiation intensities in di?erent layers.\n\nAs demonstrated in the literature, even more simple gas models such as the WSGG\n\ncan provide satisfactory results for the radiative transfer prediction in combustion gases.\n\nThe superposition method applied to the WSGG has shown to be a good alternative\n\nfor radiative transfer computation in non-homogeneous mixtures, and recently has been\n\napplied in some works [Centeno et al., 2016; Fraga et al., 2017; Centeno et al., 2018].\n\nEven though in these works have been used the WSGG model based on the superposi-\n\ntion method, it was carried out for complex and multidimensional problems. However,\n\nthe application of the superposition approach in the WSGG model needs to be better\n\nunderstood in fundamental problems. Since this method is also used in the SLW mixture\n\nmodeling, the solution of this model can be adequately compared with that of the WSGG.\n\nIn this work, the WSGG and SLW model solutions are investigated in one-dimensional\n\nproblems, for H2O, CO2, and H2O/CO2 mixture gas layers, exploring di?erent pro?les of\n\ntemperature and concentration of the participating species. Moreover, the main challenge\n\nin the radiative transfer prediction using the superposition method is the combination\n\nof participating gases since it requires increasing computational e?ort as the components\n\nnumber increase. Thereby, it is fundamental to develop a methodology capable of reduce\n\nthe computational time in such cases. Performing this study with the WSGG model is\n\nanother objective of this work.\n\n2.2 Summary\n\nThe LBL method provides the higher level of accuracy in radiative transfer pre-\n\ndictions in participating media. However, it spends a computational time that can be\n\nprohibitively high for practical applications. The Band Models become a restrictive alter-\n\n\n\n13\n\nnative since it provides the gas transmissivity or the absorptance, which can not be used\n\nwith arbitrary RTE solution methods. Such di?culty is removed by the Global Models\n\nthat yield the absorption coe?cient. The WSGG is the simplest Global Model, but can\n\nprovide satisfactory results for the radiative transfer prediction in combustion gases. The\n\nSLW model has received several improvements in the last years. The formulation of this\n\nmodel is based on the superposition method, which has also been recently explored in\n\nthe WSGG model. The superposition method furnishes some new possibilities to the\n\nWSGG model, such as the treatment of mixtures with arbitrary concentrations, local\n\nvariable mole ratios, and with any number of participating species. However, the WSGG\n\nmodel, employing this approach, need to be better investigated in fundamental problems,\n\ncomparing the solution with that of SLW model, and searching for ways to reduce the\n\ncomputational e?ort which signi?cantly increases as the number of participating gases\n\nalso increases. Such investigations are made in this work.\n\n\n\n14\n\n3 FUNDAMENTALS OF THERMAL RADIATION\n\nThe thermal radiation propagation can be described by two viewpoints: quantum\n\nmechanics and classical electromagnetic wave theory. With the ?rst, the thermal radiation\n\nenergy is described as quanta of particles, or photons. A statistical mechanism is used\n\nto approximate their propagation in a medium and interaction with matter. Thermal\n\nradiation also can be viewed as consisting of electromagnetic waves. In general, radiative\n\nproperties of liquids and solids are more easily predicted using electromagnetic wave\n\ntheory, while radiative properties of gases are more conveniently obtained from quantum\n\nmechanics [Modest, 2013]. For practical engineering applications, the thermal radiation\n\nregions of interest is in the wavelength range of 0.1 \u00b5m to 100 \u00b5m, including the ultraviolet\n\nand visible (? = 0.1 to 0.7 \u00b5m), near-infrared (? = 0.7 to 10 \u00b5m), and far-infrared (? =\n\n10 to 100 \u00b5m) spectra [Howell et al., 2010].\n\nUnlike conduction and convection, the thermal radiation can be transferred over a\n\nlong distance without interacting with a medium. Because of this, it is of great importance\n\nin vacuum, space applications, and combustion processes. Another distinguishing feature\n\nwhich di?er these three heat transfer mechanisms is that conductive and convective heat\n\ntransfer rates are linearly proportional to temperature di?erences, and, on the other hand,\n\nradiative heat transfer rates are generally proportional to di?erences in temperature to\n\nthe fourth power. Therefore, thermal radiation becomes more important than conduction\n\nand convection in high temperatures, as in combustion applications (?res, furnaces, rocket\n\nnozzles, engines, etc.). Since the modern technologies have as priority higher e?ciencies, it\n\nwill require higher temperatures, making thermal radiation even more important [Modest,\n\n2013]. This chapter will show same fundamentals concepts of thermal radiation, which\n\nare important to the development of this work.\n\n3.1 Blackbody\n\nThe concept of a blackbody is basic to the study of radiative transfer. The black-\n\nbody is called an ideal body, and it allows all the incident radiation pass into it (no\n\nre?ected energy) and internally absorbs all the incident radiation (no energy transmit-\n\nted through the body). This behavior happens for all wavenumbers and for all angles of\n\nincidence [Howell and Siegel, 2002]. Hence, the blackbody is a perfect absorber for all\n\n\n\n15\n\nincident radiation, and it serves as a standard with which real absorbers can be compared\n\nto. The blackbody also emits the maximum total amount of energy at each wavenumber\n\nand at each direction.\n\nConsidering a blackbody at temperature T enveloped by a hemispherical detector\n\nthat captures thermal radiation with a wavenumber ? within a wavenumber interval d?, as\n\nshown in Figure 3.1, the hemispherical spectral emissive power, E?b, in W/(m2.\u00b5m), is the\n\nenergy emitted by a black surface per unit time per unit area and per unit wavenumber\n\ninterval around ?. This quantity is given by Planck's spectral distribution of emissive\n\npower:\n\nE?b(?,T) =\n2C1??\n\n3\n\neC2?/T ? 1\n(3.1)\n\nwhere, C1 and C2 are constants for which the values are, respectively, 0.59552137 \u00d7 108\n\nW.\u00b5m4/(m2.sr) and 1.4387752 \u00d7 104\u00b5m; T (K) is the temperature, and ? (cm?1) is the\n\nwavenumber.\n\nIntegrating Equation 3.1 over all the spectrum, results the mathematic expression\n\ncalled Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nEb = ?T\n4 (3.2)\n\nin which Eb is the emitted blackbody energy ?ux (W/m2), and ? = 5.670400 \u00d7 10?8\n\nW/(m2.K4) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Through this expression it is possible\n\nto calculate the radiation emission quantity in all directions and all wavenumbers only\n\nknowing the blackbody temperature.\n\nFigure 3.1 ? Blackbody enveloped by a hemispherical radiation detector [adapted from\n\nHowell et al., 2010].\n\n\n\n16\n\n3.2 Thermal Radiation Intensity\n\nThe intensity is an important quantity for studying radiative transfer in absorbing,\n\nemitting, and scattering media due to certain invariance properties. The emitted spec-\n\ntral intensity is de?ned as the energy emitted per unit time per unit small wavenumber\n\ninterval around the wavenumber ?, per unit elemental projected surface area normal to\n\nthe direction and into a unit elemental solid angle centered around the direction given by\n\nthe polar angle ?. For an elemental area dA within participating media shown in Fig. 3.2,\n\nthe spectral radiation intensity is:\n\nI? =\nd3QR\n\ndA cos ?d?d?\n(3.3)\n\nwhere I? is expressed in W/(m2.\u00b5m.sr). For a non-attenuating and non-emitting medium\n\nwith constant properties, the intensity in a given direction is independent of position along\n\nthat direction.\n\nFigure 3.2 ? Spectral intensity emitted by an elemental area dA [adapted from Siegel\n\nand Howell, 1993].\n\nAnother feature is that the radiation emitted by the blackbody depends on the\n\nwavenumber and on the temperature, and it is independent of direction, being, thus,\n\na di?use emitter [Howell and Siegel, 2002]. The blackbody radiation intensity has its\n\nrelation with the spectral emissive power according to:\n\nI?b(?,T) =\nE?b\n?\n\n=\n2C1?\n\n3\n\neC2?/T ? 1\n(3.4)\n\nin which I?b is the spectral radiation intensity emitted by blackbody, in W/(m2.\u00b5m.sr).\n\nFor a participating media, such as a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide,\n\n\n\n17\n\nthe radiative intensity is a function of the distance along a path. It happens due to\n\nabsorption, emission and the scattering e?ects of the medium.\n\n3.2.1 Attenuation of Intensity by Absorption\n\nThe spectral radiation of intensity I? incident normally on a volume element of\n\nthickness ds which absorbs radiation, can be analyzed in Fig. 3.3. As radiation passes\n\nthrough ds, its intensity is reduced by absorption. This change in the intensity is propor-\n\ntional to the magnitude of the local intensity, as has been found experimentally [Howell\n\nand Siegel, 2002]. If the media is non-scattering, the coe?cient of proportionality will be\n\nthe absorption coe?cient (??). Thus, the decrease is:\n\ndI? = ???I?ds (3.5)\n\nFigure 3.3 ? Intensity incident normally on absorbing volume element dV [adapted from\n\nSiegel and Howell, 1993)].\n\n3.2.2 The Increase of Intensity by Emission\n\nFor emission of energy within the medium, it is considered an elemental volume\n\ndV (Figure. 3.4) at the center of a large black hollow sphere of radius R at uniform\n\ntemperature T . The elemental volume dV limits a participating medium with absorption\n\ncoe?cient ??, and the space between dV and the sphere is ?lled with non-participating\n\nmaterial. The spectral intensity incident at the elemental area dAs, from element dA\n\nis I?(s = 0) = I?b(?,T), where I?b is the blackbody spectral intensity. Because of the\n\n\n\n18\n\nabsorption, the change of the intensity in dV is [Howell and Siegel, 2002]:\n\n? I?(0)??ds = ?I?b(?,T)??ds (3.6)\n\nThe energy absorbed by the di?erential volume dSdAs is I?b(?,T)??dSdAsd?d?, where\n\nd? = dA/R2 and dAs is the projected area normal to I?(0). The energy emitted by dA\n\nand absorbed by all of dV is ??I?b(?,T )dV d?d? (result from integration over all dAsdS\n\nelements), where d? is the solid angle de?ned by dA when viewed from dV . The energy\n\nincident upon dV from the entire spherical enclosure, is obtained by integration over all\n\nsolid angles, which gives 4???I?b(?,T)dV d?.\n\nFigure 3.4 ? Geometry for derivation of emission from elemental volume[ Siegel and\n\nHowell, 1993].\n\nThe elemental volume dV must emit energy equal to that absorbed to maintain\n\nequilibrium in the enclosure. Hence, for a isothermal volume, the spectral emissivity is\n\ngiven by the expression:\n\n4???I?b(?,T)I?b(?,T)dV d? = 4??I?b(?,T)E?b(?,T)dV d? (3.7)\n\nwhere E?b is the blackbody spectral emissive power. Finally, considering that the thermal\n\nemission is uniform over all directions, the spectral intensity emitted by an elemental\n\nvolume into any direction is:\n\ndI? = ??I?bds (3.8)\n\n\n\n19\n\n3.3 Spectral Line Broadening\n\nIt is convenient to discuss the radiation process by utilizing a photon or quantum\n\npoint of view. Since the photon is the basic unit of radiative energy, the emission releases\n\nphotons, and absorption is the capture of photons. When a photon is emitted or absorbed,\n\nthe energy is correspondingly decreased or increased. However, a photon can also transfer\n\npart of its energy by the scattering process which is of minor engineering relevance [Howell\n\nand Siegel, 2002]. The magnitude of the radiative energy transition is related to the\n\nfrequency of the emitted or absorbed radiation according to:\n\nEp = Ej ?Ei = h?ij (3.9)\n\nin which h is Planck's constant and ? is the frequency of the photon energy; Ei and Ej\n\nare the energy that a photon can present in the levels i and j, respectively.\n\nA ?xed frequency is associated with the transition from a speci?c energy level to\n\nanother. Thus, in the absence of other e?ects, the spectrum of the emitted radiation\n\nis a spectral line at that frequency. For a photon to be absorbed, the frequency of the\n\nphoton energy must have one of certain discrete values. According to Equation 3.9, very\n\nlittle energy could be absorbed from the entire incident spectrum by an absorption line,\n\nsince only those having a single wavenumber could be absorbed. However, other e?ects\n\ncause the line to be broadened and consequently to have a ?nite wavenumber span around\n\nthe transition wavenumber ?ij. Some important e?ects are the physical mechanisms such\n\nas natural, Doppler, collision, and Stark broadening. Each one of these mechanisms\n\ncontribute to a certain shape of the spectral lines, as shown in Figure 3.5, where ?D\n\nand ?L are the spectral line half-width for Doppler and Lorentz broadening, respectively,\n\nmeasured in the middle of the height.\n\nThe line intensity can be obtained with the integration of the absorption coe?cient\n\nover all the wavenumber range according to the following expression:\n\nSij =\n\n? ?\n0\n\n??,ij(?)d? =\n\n? ?\n??\n\n??,ij(?)d(? ??ij) (3.10)\n\nwhere Sij and ??,ij depend on the number of molecules in transition between the levels\n\ni and j, and on the gas density. The e?ect of the density on magnitude is seen taking\n\nthe ratio ??/Sij. Thus, it shows the e?ect of density in changing the line shape. In the\n\n\n\n20\n\nsubsections that follow are shown the mechanisms of line broadening.\n\nFigure 3.5 ? Spectral line shape for di?erent line broadening mechanisms [adapted from\n\nModest, 2013].\n\n3.3.1 Natural Broadening\n\nThis mechanism happens when a stationary emitter not perturbed by any external\n\ne?ects emits energy over a ?nite spectral interval about each transition wavenumber. This\n\nnatural line broadening arises from the uncertainty in the exact levels Ei and Ej of the\n\ntransition energy states, and is given by the Lorentz pro?le [Howell et al., 2010]:\n\n?ij(?)\n\nSij\n=\n\n??/?\n\n?2? + (? ??ij)2\n(3.11)\n\nwhere ?? is the half-width. In engineering applications the half-width for natural broaden-\n\ning is usually small compared with that for other line broadening phenomena, and, thus,\n\nthis mechanism is neglected.\n\n3.3.2 Doppler Broadening\n\nSince the atoms or molecules of an absorbing or emitting gas are not stationary,\n\nit has a distribution of velocities associated with its thermal energy. If the gas molecules\n\nare in thermal equilibrium, it has a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities which\n\n\n\n21\n\nresults in a spectral line shape with a Gaussian distribution [Howell et al., 2010]:\n\n?ij(?)\n\nSij\n=\n\n1\n\n?D\n\n?\nln 2\n\n?\nexp\n\n[\n? (? ??ij)2\n\nln 2\n\n?2D\n\n]\n(3.12)\n\nin which ?D is the line half-width for Doppler broadening,\n\n?D =\n?ij\nc\n\n(\n2KT\n\nM\nln 2\n\n)1/2\n(3.13)\n\nHere, c is the speed of light in the vacuum (c = 2.998 \u00d7 108m/s), K is Boltzmann's\n\nconstant (K = 1.3806 \u00d7 10?23J/K), T is the temperature in K, and M is the molecules\n\nmass, in kg. Since ?D depends on T 1/2, the Doppler broadening becomes important at\n\nhigh temperatures, more speci?cally above those found in combustion systems.\n\n3.3.3 Collision Broadening\n\nThe collision rate by an atom or molecule increases when the gas pressure gas\n\nis increased, and it perturbs the energy states of atoms or molecules, resulting in colli-\n\nsion broadening of spectral lines. The line shape has a Lorentz pro?le, as the natural\n\nbroadening [Howell et al., 2010]:\n\n?ij(?)\n\nSij\n=\n\n?c/?\n\n?2c + (? ??ij)2\n(3.14)\n\nwhere the collision half-width ?c is determined by the collision rate,\n\n?c =\n1\n\n2?c\n\n4\n?\n?D2pi\n\n(MKT)1/2\n(3.15)\n\nin which D is the diameter of the atoms or molecules and pi is the gas pressure for the\n\nsingle component gas. With this equation, it is shown that collision broadening become\n\nimportant at high pressures and low temperatures. For engineering infrared conditions,\n\nthe collision broadening is often the mean contributor to line broadening, and the other\n\nline broadening mechanisms can usually be neglected.\n\n3.3.4 Stark Broadening\n\nWhen the Stark e?ect happens, the energy levels of the radiating gas particles can\n\nbe greatly perturbed due to the presence of strong electric ?elds. This kind of physical\n\nmechanism can produce very large line broadening. The Stark broadening is observed\n\n\n\n22\n\nin ionized gases due to the interactions of radiating particles with electrons and protons.\n\nThe line shapes must be calculated by quantum mechanisms, and are quite unsymmetrical\n\nand complicated.\n\n3.4 Absorption Coe?cient\n\nAs already discussed, the absorption coe?cient of participating gases has a strong\n\nvariation with the wavenumber. The determination of this coe?cient is given by means of\n\nthe computation of the absorption cross section, which, according to Howell et al., 2010,\n\nis obtained with the Lorentz collision pro?le:\n\nC? =\n?\ni\n\nSi\n?\n\n?i\n?2i + (? ??i)2\n\n(3.16)\n\nIn this equation ? is the wavenumber, C? is the absorption cross section, in cm2/molecule,\n\nSi is the integrated intensity of the line i, ?i is the line location in the spectrum (found\n\nin spectral databases), and ?i is the line half-width. In Equation 3.16 the summation\n\nincludes all the lines that are within an interval ??, for which the contribution of C? is\n\nsigni?cant.\n\nIn the work of Wang and Modest, 2004, it is shown that, for both H2O and CO2,\n\nthe Lorentz pro?le is adequate for total pressure of 1 atm or higher and temperatures\n\nabove 2500 K. The integrated intensity of a spectral line, Si, for a given temperature T\n\n(K), is calculated with the following expression [Rothman et al., 2010]:\n\nSi(T) = Si(T0)\nQ(T0)\n\nQ(T)\n\nexp(?C2Ei/T)\nexp(?C2Ei/T0)\n\n1 ?exp(?C2?iT)\n1 ?exp(?C2?iT0)\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere T0 is the database reference temperature (T0 = 296 K in the HITEMP), Q is\n\nthe total intern partition sum (which depends on the molecule structure, its isotope and\n\ntemperature) [Fischer et al., 2003], and represents the summation of all energy states\n\n(electronic, vibrational, rotational, torsional, etc.); Ei is the energy of the lower state\n\n(cm?1), and ?i is the energy di?erence between the initial and ?nal state (given as vacuum\n\nwavenumber, cm?1, in the database). The constant C2 is the second Planck's constant\n\n(C2 = 1.43877 cm.K).\n\nThe quantities Si(T0), Ei, and ?i are provided in the HITRAN compilation, and\n\nthe value of Q is obtained with a Fortran routine [Fischer et al., 2003] available in the\n\ndatabases. The line half-width ?i (p,T) for a gas at pressure p (atm), temperature T (K),\n\n\n\n23\n\nand partial pressure pi (atm), is calculated as [Rothman et al., 1998]:\n\n?i(p,T) =\n\n(\nT0\nT\n\n)n[\n?air,i(p0,T0)(p?pi) + ?self,i(p0,T0)pi\n\n]\n(3.18)\n\nin which n is the temperature dependence coe?cient, p0 is the reference pressure, ?air,i\n\nis the air-broadened half-width, and ?self,i is the self-broadened half-width. Since the\n\ndatabases only provides ?air,i, Rothman et al., 1998 proposes that n = ?air,i = ?self,i.\n\nAfter de?ning the spectral line intensity Si(T), the line half-wight ?i (p,T), and\n\nthe absorption cross section C?, then the absorption coe?cient can be expressed as:\n\n??(p,T,Y ) = N(p,T)Y C?(p,T,Y ) (3.19)\n\nHere, Y = pi/p is the gas molar fraction, N(p,T) = pNA/RuT is the gas molar density,\n\nbeing NA = 6.022\u00d710?23 molecules/mol the Avogadro's number, and Ru = 8.314 J/mol.K\n\nthe gases universal constant.\n\n3.5 Spectral Databases\n\nThe advances in the spectroscopy of high resolution in the last decades have been\n\nvery important in the thermal radiation ?eld. It allowed the detailed compilation of\n\nparameters of those molecules that are the mean constituents of the terrestrial atmosphere.\n\nMcClatchey et al., 1973 published a technical report containing spectral data of molecules\n\nof water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and oxygen.\n\nSome of the parameters included were the frequency, intensity, half-width and the energy\n\nof the lower state of transition. Posteriorly, this study gave rise to the HITRAN database\n\n[Rothman et al., 1987] which has been periodically updated. The HITRAN2012 [Rothman\n\net al., 2013] encompassing spectral information of 47 molecules. This database has its\n\norigins in applications for conditions of the terrestrial atmosphere. The last update is the\n\nHITRAN2016 [Gordon et al., 2017].\n\nFor combustion applications arises the need of molecules spectra at high temper-\n\natures (> 1000 K). This requirement was attended by Rothman et al., 1995 with the\n\nHITEMP1995 spectroscopic database. Hence, it contains many more spectral lines than\n\nHITRAN for participating species. The last version, the HITEMP2010, has the spectral\n\ndata of the absorbers H2O, CO2, CO, NO, and OH [Rothman et al., 2010]. One inter-\n\nesting point to note is that in the HITEMP2010 there is an amount of spectral lines for\n\n\n\n24\n\nH2O and CO2 much greater than for the others species, as can be seen in Table 3.1.\n\nTable 3.1 ? Number of spectral lines for molecules of the HITEMP2010 [Rothman et al.,\n\n2010].\n\nMolecule Spectral Coverage (cm?1) Number of Spectral Lines\nH2O 0 - 30,000 111,377,777\nCO2 258 - 9,648 11,167,618\nCO 0 - 8,465 115,218\nNO 0 - 9,274 105,633\nOH 0 - 19,268 40,055\n\n3.6 Radiative Transfer Equation\n\nWhen it is considered a participating media, such as a H2O/CO2 mixtures at\n\nhigh temperatures, the particles emits and absorbs radiation, and the scattering of this\n\nquantity can be neglected. To take into account the emission and absorption e?ects it\n\nis necessary to do the radiative energy balance over the enclosure. Thus, it results in\n\nthe radiative transfer equation (RTE) which, for a non-scattering media, accounts for the\n\nspectral intensity variation along a given path x [Modest, 2013]:\n\ndI?\ndx\n\n= ???(x)I?(x) + ??(x)I?b(x) (3.20)\n\nwhere, in the right-side, the ?rst term represents the intensity attenuation due to ab-\n\nsorption, and the second is the intensity increasing due to emission; ?? is the spectral\n\nabsorption coe?cient and I?b is the blackbody spectral radiation intensity, which were\n\ndiscussed in the previous sections. This equation needs to be solved for all directions and\n\nwavenumbers.\n\n3.7 Summary\n\nUnlike conduction and convection, the thermal radiation can be transferred along\n\na distance without interacting with the medium. Since this mechanism is proportional to\n\ndi?erences in temperature to the fourth power, it is very important in high temperatures\n\nsuch as those of combustion process. In this kind of problems, the blackbody, as a perfect\n\nabsorber for all incident thermal radiation, serves as a standard with which real absorbers\n\n\n\n25\n\ncan be compared. Another fundamental de?nition in the radiation ?eld is the spectral\n\nintensity. As the radiation passes through a participating media, the intensity can be\n\nattenuated by absorption, and increased by emission. The concepts of line broadening also\n\nmust be considered. For engineering applications, the e?ect of the collision broadening\n\nis the most important. However, the Doppler broadening can become also relevant at\n\nelevated temperatures. To solve the RTE, besides to calculate the radiation intensity, it\n\nis needed to know the absorption coe?cient of the gases. This coe?cient depends on the\n\nabsorption cross section, which can be obtained from the spectral databases.\n\n\n\n26\n\n4 AVAILABLE METHODS FOR SPECTRAL INTEGRATION OF THE\n\nRTE AND A NEW PROPOSITION\n\nAfter presenting the spectral form of the RTE, which needS to be solved for all di-\n\nrection and all wavenumbers, some methods for its spectral integration will be described.\n\nIn this chapter, only the methods relevant to this work will be shown. The LBL integra-\n\ntion may require a high computational time depending on the problem under analysis.\n\nIt happens due to the highly irregular behavior of the absorption coe?cient with the\n\nwavenumber. One common alternative is to apply the gas models such as the WSGG and\n\nthe SLW for the radiative transfer computation.\n\n4.1 The Line-by-Line Integration\n\nAs already discussed, the absorption coe?cient of the participating gases presents\n\na strong variation with the wavenumber. This behavior is characterized by hundreds of\n\nthousands of spectral lines forming the gases spectra. In the Line-by-Line (LBL) solution\n\nof the RTE it is considered each one of these spectral lines individually. Because of this\n\napproach, the LBL method is taken as a benchmark solution with which the accuracy of\n\nthe gases models is veri?ed.\n\nIn Figure 4.1 there is a representation of an one-dimensional participating medium\n\nbounded by two parallel surfaces separated by a distance L. The spectral intensities in\n\nthe forward and backward direction, I+?,l(x) and I\n?\n?,l(x), in a non-scattering participat-\n\ning media, are determined from the RTE equation as follow, according to the discrete\n\nordinates method (DOM)[Cassol et al., 2014; Modest, 2013]:\n\n\u00b5l\ndI+?,l(x)\n\ndx\n= ???(x)I+?,l(x) + ??(x)I?b(x) (4.1)\n\n?\u00b5l\ndI??,l(x)\n\ndx\n= ???(x)I??,l(x) + ??(x)I?b(x) (4.2)\n\nin which \u00b5l is the the cosine of the polar angle ?l in l direction, I\n+\n?,l and I\n\n?\n?,l are the\n\nspectral radiation intensities for \u00b5l > 0 and \u00b5l &lt;0, respectively; x is the spatial position.\n\nConsidering that the walls are black with known temperatures, the boundary conditions\n\nfor Equations 4.1 and 4.2 at positions x = 0 and x = L are, respectively, I+?,l(0) = I?b(0)\n\nand I??,l(L) = I?b(L).\n\n\n\n27\n\nFigure 4.1 ? Schematic representation of the one-dimensional domain studied.\n\nIf Equation 4.1 and 4.2 are solved for all directions and wavenumbers, the radiative\n\nheat ?ux and the heat source, q\u201dR and ?qR, respectively, at position x, can be calculated by\n\n[Cassol et al., 2014]:\n\nq\u201dR(x) =\n\nnd?\nl=1\n\n?\n?\n\n2?\u00b5l?l\n[\nI+?,l(x) ? I\n\n?\n?,l(x)\n\n]\nd? (4.3)\n\n?qR(x) =\n\nnd?\nl=1\n\n?\n?\n\n2??l??\n{[\nI+?,l(x) + I\n\n?\n?,l(x)\n\n]\n? 2I?b(x)\n\n}\nd? (4.4)\n\nwhere, for nd directions, the \u00b5l and the weights ?l of the quadrature scheme are de?ned\n\nwithin the interval [0,1]. To solve the radiative transfer equation, in this work was used\n\nthe Gauss Legendre quadrature.\n\nUsually the RTE must be solved for a mixture of gases such as those found in\n\ncombustion systems. Thus, the spectral absorption coe?cient in Equations 4.1 and 4.2\n\nhas to be modi?ed. For a mixture of H2O and CO2 this coe?cient is written then as:\n\n?? = ??,w + ??,c (4.5)\n\nin which ??,w and ??,c are the spectral absorption coe?cients for H2O and CO2, respec-\n\ntively.\n\n4.2 Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases\n\nSince the LBL integration solves the RTE for each spectral line, it requires a high\n\ncomputational time which may be not feasible for practical applications. Based on this,\n\nthe Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (WSGG) model comes to overcome this di?cult with\n\na good accuracy. Initially proposed by Hottel and Saro?m, 1967, this model replaces the\n\n\n\n28\n\nspectrum by a set of gray gases with uniform pressure absorption coe?cient, as shown in\n\nFigure 4.2. Thus, it is assumed that each gray gas covers a ?xed portion ??j in the spec-\n\ntrum. Moreover, each pressure absorption coe?cient ?p,j is assumed to be independent\n\nof the temperature and partial pressure of the participating gases.\n\nFigure 4.2 ? Pressure absorption coe?cient representation using ng gray gases [ adapted\n\nfrom Dorigon et al., 2013].\n\nOne parameter of great importance for the WSGG model is the total emittance\n\nalong a certain path s in a medium at a given temperature and composition. This quantity\n\naccounts for the amount of energy emitted by a participating media compared with the\n\nenergy emitted by a blackbody. Thereby, the total emittance is expressed as [Howell et al.,\n\n2010]:\n\n?(s) =\n?\n?\n?\nI?b??(s)d??\n?\nI?bd?\n\n(4.6)\n\nThe Kirchho?'s law states that the absorbed and emitted energies must be equal: ?? = ??,\n\nwhere ?? is the spectral emittance, and ?? the spectral absorptance which is de?ned by\n\nthe expression:\n\n??(s) = 1 ?e??p?Ps (4.7)\n\nThis equation expresses the fraction of spectral intensity that has been absorbed along\n\na path s, where ?p? = ??/P is the absorption coe?cient based on pressure, being P\n\nthe sum of the partial pressures of the individual species of the gaseous mixture. Thus,\n\nEquation 4.6 can be rewritten as follows:\n\n?(s) =\n?\n?\n?\nI?b\n[\n1 ?e??p?Ps\n\n]\nd?\n\n?T 4\n(4.8)\n\nFor the WSGG model, the total emittance is evaluated according to the following\n\n\n\n29\n\nrelation [Smith et al., 1982]:\n\n?(s) =\n\nng?\nj=0\n\naj(T)\n\n[\n1 ?e??p,jPs\n\n]\n(4.9)\n\nwhere aj(T) is the weighting factor for each gray gas, based on the gas temperature;\n\nj = 0 represents the spectral windows for which the absorption coe?cient is null, and\n\nng indicates the number of gray gases. The weighting factor, aj(T), may be physically\n\ninterpreted as the fraction of the blackbody energy in the range of the spectrum in which\n\nthe gray gas has a pressure absorption coe?cient ?p,j. Another interpretation for aj(T)\n\nand ?p,j is that they are the numerical values that yield the better ?t of Equation 4.9.\n\nThe coe?cients aj(T) can be represented by polynomial functions [Smith et al., 1982]:\n\naj(T) =\nK?\nk=0\n\nbj,kT\nk (4.10)\n\nin which bj,k is the polynomial coe?cient of kth order for the jth gray gas. Despite the\n\ntransparent window having a null absorption coe?cient, the weighting factor must be\n\ndi?erent from zero to assure that radiation energy is conserved:\n\na0 = 1 ?\nng?\nj=1\n\naj (4.11)\n\nTo solve Equation 4.9 - 4.11 the ?p,j and bj,k coe?cients for H2O/CO2 mixtures\n\nhave been proposed in the last years [Galar\u00e7a et al., 2008; Kangwanpongpan et al., 2012;\n\nDorigon et al., 2013]. In this work was adopted the Dorigon et al., 2013 correlations for\n\na partial pressure ratio between H2O and CO2 (pw/pc) equal to 2, as shown in Table 4.1.\n\nSuch correlations are valid for a temperature range from 400 K to 2500 K, and for the\n\npressure path lengths Ps of Equations 4.7 - 4.9 between 0.001 atm.m and 10 atm.m.\n\nTable 4.1 ?

For a H2O/CO2 mixture, the coe?cient ?j can be rewritten as ?m,i to\n\nhave the contribution of each participating gas: ?m,i = ?w,j + ?c,k, being kw,j and kc,k\n\nthe gray gas absorption coe?cient for H2O and CO2, respectively. Considering a gaseous\n\nmixture con?ned between two parallel surfaces, Equation 4.12 can be written for positive\n\nand negative directions, according to the discrete ordinates method [Cassol et al., 2014;\n\nModest, 2013]:\n\n\u00b5l\ndI+j,l(x)\n\ndx\n= ??j(x)I+j,l(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.13)\n\n?\u00b5l\ndI?j,l(x)\n\ndx\n= ??j(x)I?j,l(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.14)\n\nin which \u00b5l is the cosine of the polar angle ?l in the l direction, I\n+\nj,l and I\n\n?\nj,l are the\n\nradiation intensities of the gray gas j for \u00b5l > 0 and \u00b5l &lt;0, respectively. Whereas the\n\nwalls are black with known temperatures, the boundary conditions for Equations 4.13\n\nand Equation 4.14 at positions x = 0 and x = L are, respectively, I+j,l(0) = aj(0)Ib(0) and\n\nI?j,l(L) = aj(L)Ib(L).\n\nSolving Equations 4.13 and 4.14, the radiative heat ?ux and heat source, q\u201dR and\n\n?qR, respectively, at a position x, can be determined as [Cassol et al., 2014; Dorigon et al.,\n\n2013]:\n\nq\u201dR(x) =\n\nng?\nj=0\n\nnd?\nl=1\n\n2?\u00b5l?l\n[\nI+j,l(x) ?

Cassol et al., 2014 applied the superposition method as a way to eliminate\n\nthis restriction. This approach consists of ?rst setting up independent correlations for\n\neach species, which are then superposed to form the WSGG correlations for the mixture.\n\nThus, it is possible to compute the radiative heat transfer in mixtures with arbitrary\n\nconcentrations, allowing for local variations in the mole ratios, and the inclusion of any\n\nnumber of participating species.\n\nAccording to the superposition method, for a mixture of water vapor and carbon\n\ndioxide, the gray gas absorption coe?cient is a sum of a given combination of gray gases\n\nabsorption coe?cient of the components, and the weighting factor will be the product of\n\ntheir respective weighting factors. These de?nitions are represented by the expressions:\n\n?m,i = ?w,j + ?c,k (4.17)\n\nam,i(T) = aw,j(T) \u00d7ac,k(T) (4.18)\n\nwhere ?w,j and ?c,k are the local absorption coe?cients for the jth and the kth gray\n\ngas of H2O and CO2, respectively; aw,j(T) and ac,k(T) are the corresponding weighting\n\nfactors. Such method is similar to the implementation realized by Smith et al., 1987 for\n\nthe WSGG model combining H2O and CO2 with soot, and was also applied to the SLW\n\nmodel development for H2O/CO2 mixtures [Denison and Webb, 1995b].\n\nSince this methodology requires the correlations of the individuals species, in this\n\nwork it is adopted those found by Cassol et al., 2014 for H2O and CO2. These correlations,\n\ndescribed in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, are valid for temperatures between 400 K and 2500 K,\n\nand 0.001 atm.m to 10 atm.m.\n\nTable 4.2 ?

However, this approach\n\nneeds to be better investigated when used for the radiative transfer prediction in com-\n\nbustion gases. In this case, the main challenge is the combination of participating species\n\nsince it requires increasing computational e?ort as the components number increase. For\n\ncombustion problems modeling, the thermal radiation calculation needs to be coupled\n\nwith other complex phenomena such as chemical kinetic and turbulence. Thereby, any\n\ncomputational cost improvement in the thermal radiation prediction is of great relevance.\n\nConsidering a H2O/CO2 mixture, the present proposition is based on the absorp-\n\ntion coe?cient of each specie. Let ?w,j and ?c,k be the absorption coe?cient of the H2O\n\nand CO2, respectively, and j and k varying from 0 (transparent window) to ng (number\n\nof gray gaes). Thus, the main assumption for the reduced superposition method can be\n\nwritten as: ???\n??\n?w,j >> ?c,k, if j > k\n\n?w,j&lt;&lt;?c,k, if j &lt;k\n(4.19)\n\nThis assumption can be obtained from the analysis of the WSGG correlations [Cassol\n\net al., 2014], observing that the ?w,j and ?c,j coe?cients are given as follows:???\n??\n?w,j = pw?p,j\n\n?c,k = pc?p,k\n\n(4.20)\n\nwhere pw and pc are the partial pressures of H2O and CO2, respectively; ?p,j and ?p,k are\n\naccordingly the pressure absorption coe?cient which are found in the literature [Cassol\n\n\n\n33\n\net al., 2014], and as shown in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, they are arranged in order of magnitude\n\nthat makes the assumption of Equation 4.19 possible.\n\nIt is fundamental to emphasize the relevance of the partial pressure of the partici-\n\npating species (pw and pc). The assumption of the Equation 4.19 is valid when the partial\n\npressure ratio (pw/pc), from Equation 4.20, is on scale with 1 (pw/pc ? 1). Otherwise, if\n\npw/pc ratio is much larger or much smaller, the proposed reduced superposition method\n\nmay not accurately predict the radiative transfer. In such a case it is necessary to evaluate\n\nif the regions where this happens are important or not to the thermal radiation.\n\nIn Figure 4.3 there is a representation of the proposed reduced superposition\n\nmethod. The combination of two absorption coe?cients of H2O (?w,j) with those of\n\nCO2 (?c,k) is shown in Figure 4.3(a), where the subscripts j and k are varying from 0\n\n(transparent window) to 4 (number of gray gases). In the case where j = k the absorption\n\ncoe?cient of the two species has the same magnitude, and, then, the absorption coe?cient\n\ni of the mixture, ?m,i, will have the contribution of both the H2O and the CO2 absorption\n\ncoe?cients. The same happens for the weighting factor of the mixture, am,i(T), forming\n\nthen one gray gas. This assumption can be summarized by the following expression:\n\nif j = k\n\n???\n??\n?m,i = ?w,j + ?c,k\n\nam,i(T) = aw,j(T) \u00d7ac,k(T)\n(4.21)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 4.3 ? Reduced superposition approach for the arrangement of (a) H2O coe?cients\n\nwith those of CO2, and for the arrangement of (b) CO2 coe?cients with those of H2O.\n\nEach of the combinations for which j > k will also form one gray gas. However,\n\nthese gray gases will have the same absorption coe?cient, which is ?w,j. This happens\n\nbecause the H2O absorption coe?cients will be much larger than those of CO2, and, then,\n\nwill predominate. Since all combinations have the same absorption coe?cient, it will\n\n\n\n34\n\ngenerate one unique gray gas i of the mixture, with absorption coe?cient ?w,j. Thus,\n\nfor this gray gas i, the absorption coe?cient, ?m,i, and the weighting factor, am,i(T), are\n\ngiven as:\n\nif j > k\n\n????\n???\n?m,i = ?w,j\n\nam,i(T) = aw,j(T) \u00d7\n[\n1 ?\n\n?4\nk+1 ac,k(T)\n\n] (4.22)\nIn Equation 4.22, for CO2, all the arrangements together will form a fraction of the\n\nblackbody energy, represented by the term [1?\n?4\n\nk+1 ac,k(T)], in the range of the spectrum\n\nwhere the gray gas of the mixture has the absorption coe?cient ?w,j. Thereby, considering,\n\nfor instance, all the possible arrangements of the absorption coe?cient ?w,4 of H2O with\n\nthose of CO2 in Figure 4.3, it will be formed only two gray gases of the mixture.\n\nFor the combinations of the CO2 absorption coe?cient with those of H2O, remains\n\nthe scheme of the Figure 4.3(b) showed for two CO2 absorption coe?cients. As can be\n\nseen, there are only the combinations for j &lt;k since those for j = k have already been\n\naccounted in the arrangement of Figure 4.3(a). Observing this, the absorption coe?cient\n\nand the weighting factor for the H2O/CO2 mixture, ?m,i and am,i(T), are expressed as\n\nfollows:\n\nif j &lt;k\n\n????\n???\n?m,i = ?c,k\n\nam,i(T) = ac,k(T) \u00d7\n[\n1 ?\n\n?4\nj+1 aw,j(T)\n\n] (4.23)\nConsidering the application of the standard superposition method for a mixture\n\nof H2O/CO2, the number of gray gases, adding the transparent windows, will be i =\n\n(j + 1) \u00d7 (k + 1). In this relation, the correlations adopted for H2O and CO2 leads to\n\nj = k = 4, then i = 25. However, if the proposed reduced superposition is adopted i is\n\nreduced to 13. This result is of great relevance when concerning computational e?ort. The\n\nradiative transfer equation (RTE) is solved approximately only half of the time needed to\n\nobtain the solution by means of the standard superposition method. Moreover, it gains\n\neven more importance when it is working with more than two participating species. In\n\nthe case of three components, the RTE should be solved 125 times applying the standard\n\nsuperposition method. Since the combustion system modeling requires the consideration\n\nof even more components, the computational time increases signi?cantly for the solution\n\nthe RTE. Because of it, it is important the development of methodologies like the one\n\npresented in this work, which are capable of decreasing the computational e?ort.\n\n\n\n35\n\n4.3 Spectral-Line Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases\n\nDerived from the formulation of the WSGG model proposed by Modest, 1991, the\n\nSpectral-Line Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (SLW) model allows for a further detailing in\n\nthe treatment of the radiation spectrum, gases mixtures, and non-isothermal and non-\n\nhomogeneous media. This model, ?rst introduced by Denison and Webb, 1993b, replaces\n\nthe traditional LBL spectral integration over the wavenumber with an integration over the\n\nspectral absorption cross-section. Numerically, it means a discretization of the spectral\n\nabsorption cross-section. The RTE has the same form as that of the WSGG model,\n\ndi?ering only in the way of calculating the gray gases absorption coe?cient and the\n\ncorrespondent weighting factors, which are obtained with the absorption line blackbody\n\ndistribution function (ALBDF). For a non-scattering media, the RTE becomes, then:\n\ndIj(x)\n\ndx\n= ??j(x)Ij(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.24)\n\nwhere ?j and aj are the absorption coe?cient and the weighting factor for each gray gas,\n\nrespectively.\n\nThe ALBDF is de?ned as the fraction of the blackbody energy in the portions of\n\nthe spectrum where the high-resolution spectral absorption cross-section of the gas C?\n\nis less than the prescribed value C, as illustrated in Figure 4.4. The dark-gray hatches\n\nrepresent the portions of the spectrum where the Planck's function (Eb?) is integrated.\n\nThe ALBDF can be expressed as [Denison and Webb, 1995c]:\n\nF(C,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) =\n1\n\n?T 4b\n\n?\ni\n\n?\n??i\n\nEb?(?,Tb)d? (4.25)\n\nin which ? is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant and Eb? is Planck's function evaluated\n\nat the wavenumber ? and blackbody temperature Tb. The subscript i refers to the ith\n\nspectral segment and the summation is performed over the all segments for which C?<C,\n\ncovering the entire spectrum. The dependence of the ALBDF on the spectrum is given\n\nby the spectral intervals ??i, which are dependent on the absorption cross-section, gas\n\ntemperature Tg, the total pressure PT , and the species concentration Y . This distribution\n\nfunction monotonically increases from 0 to 1 with increasing absorption cross section.\n\nThe discretization of C? results in the called supplemental absorption cross sections,\n\nwhose values are logarithmically spaced between the minimum and maximum values of\n\n\n\n36\n\nFigure 4.4 ? Representation of part of the spectrum in which the ALBDF is calculated\n\n[adapted from Solovjov et al., 2016].\n\nC?. Each discrete increment of C? is represented by a single absorption cross section Cj\n\nor a single gray gas. Thus, for each gray gas, the fraction of blackbody energy, aj, for\n\na given source temperature, is computed as the di?erence of two distribution functions\n\nevaluated at the supplementals absorption cross sections C?j and C?j+1:\n\naj = F(C?j+1,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) ?F(C?j,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) (4.26)\n\nThe application of the SLW model to non-isothermal and/or non-homogeneous\n\nmedia is made through scaling approximations, wherein a non-isothermal and/or non-\n\nhomogeneous gas is replaced with an equivalently absorbing isothermal homogeneous gas.\n\nThe most known is the Curtis-Godson approximation [Godson, 1953]. Goody and Yung,\n\n1989 showed that the scaling approximations are exact if the high-resolution absorption\n\ncross section can be expressed as the product of two functions [Denison and Webb, 1995c]:\n\nC?(Tg,PT ,Y ) = ?(Tg,PT ,Y )?(?) (4.27)\n\nwhere ? and ? de?ne the spatial and the spectral dependence of the absorption cross\n\nsection, respectively. For non-isotherm and/or non-homogeneous problems, the spectral\n\nintegration of the RTE leads to the appearance of the additional so-called Liebnitz terms\n\n[Denison and Webb, 1993b], which makes the analysis complicated . However, employing\n\nthe scaling approximation, these terms vanish, and, therefore, the RTE can be solved with\n\n\n\n37\n\narbitrary solution methods.\n\nThe employment of the scaling approximation can be analyzed through Figure 4.5.\n\nIn this ?gure there is a high-resolution portion of an ideal spectrum of a gas described\n\nby Equation 4.27 at two di?erent thermodynamic states. The spectrum at the state 1 is\n\nrepresented by temperature Tg1, total pressure PT1, and molar fraction Y1. For this state,\n\nthe ALBDF may be calculated by integrating Planck's function over all spectral segments\n\nwhere C?(Tg1,PT1,Y1) is less than the prescribed value Cj(Tg1,PT1,Y1). The stated 2\n\nis described by temperature Tg2, total pressure PT2, and molar fraction Y2. Then, if the\n\nEquation 4.27 is valid, the absorption cross section of the state 2, Cj(Tg2,PT2,Y2), is given\n\nas [Denison and Webb, 1995c]:\n\nCj(Tg2,PT2,Y2) = Cj(Tg1,PT1,Y1)\n?(Tg2,PT2,Y2)\n\n?(Tg1,PT1,Y1)\n(4.28)\n\nThis result is due to function ?(?) be independent of the gas state, according to Equa-\n\ntion 4.27.\n\nFigure 4.5 ? Idealized dependence of high resolution spectrum on two di?erent\n\nthermodynamics states, resulting in equivalent blackbody energy fractions [adapted\n\nfrom Solovjov et al., 2017].\n\nAs can be observed in Figure 4.5, the spectral segments de?ned where C?(Tg1,PT1,Y1)\n\nis less than the prescribed value Cj(Tg1,PT1,Y1) are identical to those spectral segments\n\nwhere C?(Tg2,PT2,Y2) is less than Cj(Tg2,PT2,Y2). Thereby, from the de?nition of the\n\n\n\n38\n\nALBDF, there is an equality between the ALBDFs of the two thermodynamic states for\n\na given blackbody temperature, established by the following expression:\n\nF\n[\nCj(Tg2,PT2,Y2); Tb = Tref ; Tg = Tg2; Y = Y2; PT = PT2\n\n]\n= F\n\n[\nCj(Tg1,PT1,Y1); Tb = Tref ; Tg = Tg1; Y = Y1; PT = PT1\n\n] (4.29)\nwhere Tref is a reference temperature. This equation provides an implicit dependence\n\nof Cj on the local gas state. Thus, the local absorption cross section Cj is determined\n\nfrom the following implicit equation, which is the Equation 4.29 written for equivalent\n\nabsorption-line blackbody functions at the reference and the local states [Denison and\n\nWebb, 1995c]:\n\nF\n[\nCj; Tb = Tref ; Tg = Tloc; Y = Yloc; PT = Ploc\n\n]\n= F\n\n[\nCj,ref ; Tb = Tref ; Tg = Tref ; Y = Yref ; PT = Pref\n\n] (4.30)\nin which the \"ref\" and \"loc\" terms means the reference and the local values, respectively,\n\nof each variable. Equation 4.30 is known as the reference approach [Solovjov and Webb,\n\n2000; Solovjov et al., 2014, 2017] which assumes an ideal spectrum producing scaling of the\n\nspectrum in non-uniform media. Under this assumption, the intervals of integration can\n\nthen be ?xed for each spatial position, eliminating the Leibnitz terms. Since Equation 4.30\n\nis implicit, Cj must be determined at each spatial location from an iterative technique\n\nsuch as bisection (adopted in this work) or Newton-Raphson [Denison and Webb, 1995c].\n\nFor Solovjov and Webb, 2010 the reference approach provides satisfactory results when\n\nthe spatial temperature gradients are not too high.\n\nAccording to Denison and Webb, 1995c the reference state can be determined as the\n\nspatial average of the temperature, total pressure, and composition ?elds. The reference\n\nabsorption cross section, Cj,ref in Equation 4.30, is an appropriate value between the\n\nsupplemental absorption cross sections C?j and C?j+1, which are logarithmically spaced.\n\nThus, if su?cient gray gases (20 or more) are used, Cj,ref may be determined as the\n\nlogarithmic mean of C?j and C?j+1:\n\nCj,ref = exp\n\n[\nln(C?j) + ln(C?j+1)\n\n2\n\n]\n(4.31)\n\nThe local gray gas absorption coe?cient ?j is a function of the local molar density\n\nN, determined from an appropriate equation of state, and the local gray gas absorption\n\n\n\n39\n\ncross section Cj:\n\n?j = NY Cj (4.32)\n\nwhere Y is the local molar fraction of each participating specie.\n\nSince the fraction of blackbody energy of each gray gas, aj, has already been de?ned\n\nin Equation 4.26, remains to set the appropriated values of the gas temperature, total\n\npressure, and mole fraction to calculate aj. Denison and Webb, 1995c recommend that\n\nthe fraction of blackbody energy of each gray gas be calculated as follow:\n\naj = F(C?j+1,Tb = Tloc,Tg = Tref,PT = Pref,Y = Yref )\n\n?F(C?j,Tb = Tloc,Tg = Tref,PT = Pref,Y = Yref )\n(4.33)\n\nFor a participating media bounded by two parallel surfaces, Equation 4.24 can be\n\nwritten for positive and negative directions, according to the discrete ordinates method\n\n[Cassol et al., 2014; Modest, 2013]:\n\n\u00b5l\ndI+j,l(x)\n\ndx\n= ??j(x)I+j,l(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.34)\n\n?\u00b5l\ndI?j,l(x)\n\ndx\n= ??j(x)I?j,l(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.35)\n\nin which \u00b5l is the the cosine of the angle ?l in l direction, I\n+\nj,l and I\n\n?\nj,l are the radiation\n\nintensities for the gray gas j for \u00b5l > 0 and \u00b5l &lt;0, respectively. Considering that the\n\nwalls are black with known temperatures, the boundary conditions for Equation 4.34 and\n\nEquation 4.35 at the positions x = 0 and x = L are, respectively, I+j,l(0) = aj(0)Ib(0) and\n\nI?j,l(L) = aj(L)Ib(L).\n\nSolving Equations 4.34 and 4.35, the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source, q\u201dR\n\nand ?qR, respectively, at position x, can be determined as [Cassol et al., 2014; Dorigon\n\net al., 2013]:\n\nq\u201dR(x) =\n\nng?\nj=0\n\nnd?\nl=1\n\n2?\u00b5l?l\n[\nI+j,l(x) ? I\n\n?\nj,l(x)\n\n]\n(4.36)\n\n?qR(x) =\n\nng?\nj=1\n\nnd?\nl=1\n\n2??l?j\n{[\nI+j,l(x) + I\n\n?\nj,l(x)\n\n]\n? 2aj(x)Ib(x)\n\n}\n(4.37)\n\nwhere the summation over all gray gases (ng) represent the spectral integration in the\n\nSLW model.\n\n\n\n40\n\n4.3.1 SLW Modeling of Gas Mixture\n\nIn the SLW model, when it is considered more than one participating specie Equa-\n\ntions 4.30 - 4.33 must be solved for each specie. Thereby, for a mixture of H2O and CO2,\n\nthe absorption coe?cient is given as:\n\n?m,i = ?w,j + ?c,k (4.38)\n\nwhere ?w,j and ?c,k are the local absorption coe?cients for the jth and the kth gray gas of\n\nH2O and CO2, respectively. The value of ?w,j and ?c,k is calculated using Equation 4.32.\n\nThe direct method is considered to be the most accurate approach for treatment\n\nof mixtures in the SLW model [Solovjov et al., 2011b]. This method was developed by\n\nDenison and Webb, 1995b for binary mixtures, and later extended to multicomponent\n\ngas mixtures [Solovjov and Webb, 2000, 2001]. This approach consists of obtaining the\n\nALBDF separately for each specie. Thus, the weighting factor of H2O and CO2 can be\n\nwritten as follow, respectively:\n\naw,j = Fw(C?j+1,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) ?Fw(C?j,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) (4.39)\n\nac,k = Fc(C?j+1,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) ?Fc(C?j,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) (4.40)\n\nin which Fw and Fc are the ALBDFs for H2O and CO2, respectively. The values of the\n\nALBDF are calculated for each local mole concentration and temperature.\n\nFinally, the weighting factor for the mixture, used in the RTE, is given by the\n\nproduct of the two individual weights:\n\nam,i = aw,j \u00d7ac,k (4.41)\n\nSuch approach assumes that the spectra of the individual species are statistically uncor-\n\nrelated. Including the transparent window, the weighting factor for the mixture must\n\nsatisfy the relation:\nng?\ni=0\n\nam,i = 1 (4.42)\n\n\n\n41\n\n4.4 Summary\n\nThe most accurate radiative transfer prediction in participating media is made\n\nwith the LBL spectral integration of the RTE. However, this method spends a high com-\n\nputational time since it is needed to solve the RTE for hundreds of thousands of spectral\n\nlines. The WSGG model came up as a possible alternative. The attractiveness of this\n\nmethod is its relatively simple formulation and implementation with satisfactory accuracy\n\ndepending on the problem under analysis. The application of the WSGG model consists\n\non ?rst generating the participating gases correlations, which can be obtained for a mix-\n\nture or for the individual species. The advantage of the individual correlations for each\n\ngas is that the radiative problems can be solved for variable partial pressure ratios along\n\nthe spatial position. For a gas mixture, the combination of the individual correlations is\n\nmade through the known superposition approach. In this work is proposed the reduced\n\nsuperposition method focused on the computational e?ort reduction. The superposition\n\nmethod is also used in the SLW model. This method, more complex and detailed, is\n\nbased on the absorption line blackbody energy distribution function (ALBDF) calculated\n\nfor each participating specie through its detailed spectrum. Thus, the ALBDFs can be\n\nused to calculate the weighting factors of the mixture.\n\n\n\n42\n\n5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n5.1 Analyze Between the LBL Solution and the WSGG and SLW Models\n\nAfter describing the theory of the Gas Models of interest in this work, now it will\n\nbe applied to the radiative transfer calculation in participating gases. In this chapter\n\nwill be shown results considering two kinds of non-isothermal problems: homogeneous\n\nand non-homogeneous media. For each of them the solutions are carried out ?rst for\n\nthe individual species, and next for the mixture. The SLW and WSGG solutions for a\n\none-dimensional gas layer are compared against the LBL benchmark solutions in order to\n\nevaluate the accuracy of these models.\n\n5.1.1 Radiative Transfer in Non-isothermal, Homogeneous Media\n\nThe radiative heat transfer in non-isothermal homogeneous media is now inves-\n\ntigated. The solutions are performed using the SLW and WSGG models for a one-\n\ndimensional gas layer bounded with two black walls, which are separated by one meter.\n\nThe results are shown for the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source for which the LBL\n\nintegration serves as the benchmark solution in the comparison. The molar concentra-\n\ntions of the gases are assumed to be constant and equal to 0.1 for carbon dioxide (CO2),\n\nand 0.2 for water vapor (H2O). In all cases the total pressure is 1 atm, and a spatial\n\ndiscretization of 200 points for the grid was used. Furthermore, the discrete ordinates\n\nmethod (DOM) [Cassol et al., 2014; Modest, 2013] was applied for the angular discretiza-\n\ntion: 40 directions were used for the LBL, 8 for the SLW, 8 for WSGG that uses the\n\nCassol et al., 2014 coe?cients and 30 directions for WSGG that uses the Dorigon et al.,\n\n2013 coe?cients. Previous works show that these spatial and angular discretizations are\n\nenough to ensure the solutions independence. [Dorigon et al., 2013; Cassol et al., 2014;\n\nBrittes, 2015; Fonseca et al., 2018; Coelho and Fran\u00e7a, 2018]. For the WSGG model, 4\n\ngray gases for each participating specie were used, as found in the literature. In the SLW\n\nformulation, 20 gray gases were adopted since above of this number the solutions does\n\nnot vary signi?cantly.\n\nTo evaluate the spectral models approached in this work, three temperature pro?les\n\n\n\n43\n\nwere adopted, described as follows:\n\nT(x?) = 400 + 1400sin2(?x?) (5.1)\n\nT(x?) = 400 + 1400sin2(2?x?) (5.2)\n\nT(x?) =\n\n????\n???\n\n800 + 920sin2 (2?x?) , x? ? 0.25\n\n400 + 1400\n\n{\n1 ? sin3/4\n\n[\n2\n\n3\n?(x? ? 0.25)\n\n]}\n, x? > 0.25\n\n(5.3)\n\nin which x? = x/L, being x the local position, and L the distance between the walls.\n\nFigure 5.1 shows these temperature pro?les.

In Equations 5.4 and 5.5, max\n??q\u201dR,LBL?? and max ???dq\u201dR,LBL/dx??\n\nare the maximum absolute values of the radiative heat ?ux and heat source for each case\n\nunder analysis. Of special interest in the discussion will be the maximum deviations, ?max\n\nand ?max, and the average deviations, ?avg and ?avg, in the domain.\n\nFor the three cases presented in this section, two situations are considered. First,\n\nthe problems are solved for individual species, and, next, for the mixture using both the\n\nWSGG and the SLW models. In the WSGG model, the solution for individual species is\n\nobtained with the Cassol et al., 2014 coe?cients, while for the mixture is adopted both\n\nthe Dorigon et al., 2013 (pw/pc = 2) and the Cassol et al., 2014 coe?cients. In Case 1,\n\nthe temperature pro?le varies symmetrically in the domain, with the temperature ranging\n\nfrom 400 K on the walls to 1800 K in the mid distance between the walls. In Figures 5.2-\n\n5.4 are shown the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source for a layer of CO2, H2O and\n\nH2O/CO2 mixture, respectively.\n\nAs can be seen in these ?gures, for all these problems the radiative heat ?ux is null\n\nin the middle of the domain due to the symmetry of the temperature pro?le. Since the\n\nradiative heat ?ux is directed from the higher temperature of the medium to the walls,\n\nthe heat ?ux is positive for x? > 0.5, and negative for x? &lt;0.5. The radiative heat source\n\nhas a peak at x? = 0.5 where the temperature is at its maximum, and the negative sign\n\nmeans that the medium is losing energy due to radiation. For CO2, the WSGG model\n\npresents a worst agreement with the LBL near to the walls for both the radiative heat ?ux\n\nand the heat source. The radiative heat ?ux of H2O presents a behavior similar to that\n\nof CO2, while the maximum radiative heat source deviation occurs in the mid distance\n\nbetween the walls, such as happens for the H2O/CO2 mixture. For the problems of Case\n\n1, the radiative heat ?ux deviations for the SLW model has also its maximum value in\n\nthe middle of the domain.\n\nThe SLW and WSGG maximum and average deviations with respect to LBL in-\n\ntegration are shown in Table 5.2. For CO2, with the WSGG model, the maximum and\n\naverage deviations found for the radiative heat ?ux were of 11.53 % and 3.46 %, respec-\n\ntively. For the heat source the maximum deviation is 6.72 %, and 4.17 % for the average.\n\nWhen the SLW model is considered, it is seen (Table 5.2) that in average it has a better\n\n\n\n45\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n \n\n \nq\" R\n\n  [\n k\n\nW\n / \n\nm\n2  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n  WSGG\n\n(a)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-180\n-160\n-140\n-120\n-100\n\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n\n \n\n \n\n- d\nq\" R\n\n /d\nx \n\n [ \nkW\n\n / \nm\n\n3  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n  WSGG\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.2 ?

This\n\nhappens because the superposition approach is a coupling method for the mixture from\n\nindividual participating species coe?cients, and it introduces approximations that are\n\nnot found when the mixture is made before obtaining the coe?cients. Besides that, using\n\nthe WSGG coe?cients for mixture, the RTE is solved only for 4 gray gases and one\n\ntransparent window, while with the superposition method the RTE is solved 25 times in\n\nthe WSGG model, and 441 times in the SLW model. Except for the maximum radiative\n\nheat source deviation of the mixture, the WSGG model employing the superposition\n\nmethod leads to higher deviations than SLW. Moreover, there is another interesting point\n\nto notice: the WSGG for H2O/CO2 (pw/pc = 2) mixture solution has a relevant smaller\n\ndeviation if compared to the maximum deviations found for individual species.\n\nThe Cases 2 and 3 share some conclusions with Case 1 in such a way that only the\n\ndeviations are shown in this section.

For this reason, it\n\nwill be shown in this section some problems in which the media is non-isothermal and\n\nnon-homogeneous. The molar concentration pro?les adopted for the participating species\n\nare described by the following equations:\n\nYCO2 (x\n?) = 0.2sin2(?x?) (5.6)\n\nYCO2 (x\n?) = 0.2sin2(2?x?) (5.7)\n\nYCO2 (x\n?) = 0.1cos2(2?x?) (5.8)\n\nYH2O(x\n?) = 0.2sin2(2?x?) (5.9)\n\nin which x? = x/L, being x the local position, and L the distance between the walls.\n\nFigure 5.5 presents the pro?les of these concentration as well as those of temperature.\n\nThe three test cases studied are organized in Table 5.5. All the computational parameters\n\nare the same as those de?ned for homogeneous media in the previous section.\n\nThe ?rst two cases present a constant partial pressure ratio (pw/pc = 2) over the\n\ndomain, while for the Case 3 this ratio vary with the spatial coordinate.

The maximum temperature for this\n\ncase is 1800 K, while the minimum is 400 K and occurs in the walls and in the middle of\n\nthe domain. Because of the symmetry of the pro?les, the radiative heat ?ux is null in the\n\nhalf distance between the walls. Figures 5.6-5.8 shows the radiative heat ?ux and the heat\n\nsource for a layer of CO2, H2O and H2O/CO2 mixture, respectively. For the H2O and\n\nthe H2O/CO2 mixture problems, the radiative heat ?ux presents higher deviations near\n\nthe walls, in which there are low temperatures and molar concentrations. However, such\n\nbehavior does not happens for CO2. Furthermore, in all the problems solved for Case 1,\n\nthe SLW model leads to the higher deviation of the radiative heat source in the regions\n\nof maximum temperature and molar concentration, which was expected.\n\nTable 5.6 shows the deviations of the WSGG and SLW models with respect to the\n\nLBL benchmark solution, for individuals participating species and mixture of the Case\n\n\n\n50\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n \n\n \nq\" R\n\n  [\n k\n\nW\n / \n\nm\n2  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n WSGG\n\n(a)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-350\n\n-300\n\n-250\n\n-200\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n \n\n \n\n- d\nq\" R\n\n  /\ndx\n\n  [\n k\n\nW\n / \n\nm\n3  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n WSGG\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.6 ?

Thus, only the computed\n\ndeviation for the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source are shown in this section, and\n\nthe graphics can be seen in detail in Appendix B. As can be observed in Table 5.7, except\n\nwhen it is used the Dorigon et al., 2013 coe?cients, in average, the WSGG radiative heat\n\n?ux deviations are close to those found employing the SLW model. Further, the WSGG\n\nradiative heat source maximum deviations for H2O and H2O/CO2 (superposition) mix-\n\nture are lower than those found employing the SLW model: for H2O reaches 6.86 %, being\n\n13.57 % in the SLW model; and for H2O/CO2 (superposition) this deviation is 13.54 %,\n\nwhile for the SLW model it is 18.44 %. Such results show that the WSGG might compete\n\nvery well with the SLW, depending on the problem analyzed. It is very important for\n\nthe thermal radiation ?eld since the WSGG model present a formulation simpler to be\n\nimplemented than SLW.\n\nTable 5.7 ?

This behavior\n\ncan be observed in Case 3 which was also solved for the individual species as well as for\n\nthe mixture. The temperature and H2O molar concentration pro?les reach the maximum\n\nvalues at the positions x? = 0.25 and x? = 0.75. On the other hand, in these same\n\nlocations, the CO2 molar concentration has the lowest value, which allows for the vari-\n\nable partial pressure ratio pw/pc. The radiative heat ?ux and heat source for CO2, H2O,\n\n\n\n53\n\nand H2O/CO2 mixture are found in Figures 5.9-5.11, respectively. For the solution of\n\nthe individual species, the radiative heat ?ux calculation obtained with WSGG model\n\npresents the worst results near the walls. The radiative heat source deviation for CO2 has\n\nits maximum value in the middle of the domain where there is a peak of concentration,\n\nand a minimum of temperature; while for H2O the location where there are the maximum\n\ndeviations does not coincides with that of maximum temperature or molar concentration.\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n \n\n \n\nq\" R\n  [\n\n k\nW\n\n / \nm\n\n2  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n WSGG\n\n(a)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-250\n\n-200\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n \n\n \n\n- d\nq\" R\n\n  /\ndx\n\n  [\n k\n\nW\n / \n\nm\n3  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n WSGG\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.9 ?

It can also be veri?ed in the deviations shown in Table 5.8.\n\nOne interesting point to note is that the WSGG (pw/pc = 2) solution furnish the worst\n\nresults for the radiative heat source, as found by Cassol et al., 2014. That is expected\n\nsince the Dorigon et al., 2013 coe?cients are generated under the conditions that the\n\npartial pressure ratio between the species is 2/1 in all positions in the medium, while\n\nin fact the concentration of H2O is much smaller than that of CO2 in the middle of\n\nthe slab. However, among the solutions, such coe?cients provides the best result for\n\nthe radiative heat ?ux, having the advantage that it require the RTE to be solved only\n\nfor four gray gases and one transparent window, while with the superposition method\n\nthe RTE is solved 25 times in the WSGG model, and 441 times in the SLW model.\n\n\n\n54\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n \n\n \n q\n\n\" R\n  [\n\n k\nW\n\n / \nm\n\n2  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n WSGG\n\n(a)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-200\n\n-175\n\n-150\n\n-125\n\n-100\n\n-75\n\n-50\n\n-25\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n \n\n \n\n- d\nq\" R\n\n /d\nx \n\n [ \nkW\n\n / \nm\n\n3  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n WSGG\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.10 ?

The opposite e?ect takes\n\nplace in the vicinity of x? = 0.2 and 0.8, where the use of the WSGG (pw/pc = 2)\n\nunderpredicted the actual amount of H2O, which is a more e?ective absorber-emitter\n\nthan CO2, leading to an underestimation of the absorption of radiation from the higher\n\n\n\n55\n\ntemperature regions in the medium. Another observation is that, for the mixture made\n\nthrough the superposition method, the deviations found are very close to the maximum\n\ndeviations found for the individual species, or even smaller, in both the SLW and the\n\nWSGG models. This behavior does not appears when the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc)\n\nis constant, for which the H2O/CO2 mixture deviations expressively increase if compared\n\nto those of individuals species.\n\nTable 5.8 ?

The results were compared\n\nagainst the LBL benchmark solutions in order to evaluate the accuracy of these models.\n\nThe problems were solved for CO2 and H2O individually, and for H2O/CO2 mixtures\n\nconsidering a non-isothermal homogeneous or non-homogeneous media. In the WSGG\n\nmodel, the Cassol et al., 2014 coe?cients were adopted for the individual participating\n\nspecies. These same coe?cients were used for the mixture as well as to those of Dorigon\n\net al., 2013. For both the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous media, when pw/pc\n\nratio is constant, the results have shown that for both the WSGG and the SLW models,\n\nthe H2O deviations, in average, are higher than those found for CO2. Furthermore, for\n\nhomogeneous media, the WSGG deviations for individual species are signi?cantly greater\n\nthan those of SLW, except for the radiative heat source maximum deviation of H2O;\n\n\n\n56\n\nwhile for mixtures, when the superposition approach is used, WSGG model can provide\n\nresults as accurate as the SLW model depending on the problem under analysis. In all the\n\ncases where the partial pressure ratio is constant (pw/pc = 0.2) the Dorigon et al., 2013\n\ncoe?cients provide the better agreement with the LBL solution. It happens because the\n\nsuperposition approach is a coupling method for the mixture from individual participating\n\nspecies coe?cients, and it introduces same approximations that are not found when the\n\nmixture is made before obtaining the coe?cients. On the other hand, in the case where\n\nthe partial pressure ratio is not constant over the domain, the superposition method\n\nyields the lowest deviations for the radiative heat source. Besides that, in such condition,\n\nthe deviations for the mixture are very close to the maximum deviations found for the\n\nindividual species for both the WSGG and the SLW models, contrary to what happens\n\nfor constant partial pressure ratio.\n\n5.2 Application of the Proposed Reduced Superposition Method\n\nSince the proposed reduced superposition method for the WSGG model was de-\n\ntailed in Chapter 4, now its accuracy will be evaluated in one-dimensional radiative trans-\n\nfer problems. Furthermore, it will be evaluated the consistency of this new proposition\n\nfor the radiative transfer prediction in laminar di?usion ?ames.\n\n5.2.1 Radiative Transfer in One-dimensional Problems\n\nThe ?rst case is a non-isothermal non-homogeneous H2O/CO2 mixture. The tem-\n\nperature pro?le is that given by Equation 5.2, shown in Section 5.1.1. The CO2 concentra-\n\ntion pro?le (YCO2) is described by Equation 5.7 in Section 5.1.2, being that YH2O = 2YCO2.\n\nThus, the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc) between the species is constant through the do-\n\nmain and equal to 2.\n\nFor this case, the radiative heat ?ux and heat source were computed. Theses\n\nquantities were calculated using the WSGG model. Therefore, were adopted the standard\n\nsuperposition method [Cassol et al., 2014] and the reduced superposition method proposed\n\nin this work. The solutions obtained with these two approaches are compared against the\n\nLBL integration. As can be seen in Figure 5.12, there is no visible di?erence between\n\nthe standard and the reduced superposition method solutions for both the radiative heat\n\n?ux and the heat source. The disagreement between the solutions is only found when\n\n\n\n57\n\nthe normalized deviations with respect to the LBL benchmark solutions are computed,\n\nas shown in Table 5.9. For the radiative heat ?ux, the maximum normalized deviation\n\nfound with the standard and the reduced superposition method were 12.40 % and 12.33\n\n%, respectively; accordingly, the maximum deviations for the radiative heat source were\n\n13.22% and 12.38%.\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n \n\n \n\nq\" R\n  [\n\n k\nW\n\n / \nm\n\n2  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n Standard-Superposition\n Reduced-Superposition\n\n(a)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\n-1200\n\n-1000\n\n-800\n\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n \n\n \n\n- d\nq\" R\n\n  /\ndx\n\n  [\n k\n\nW\n / \n\nm\n3  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n Standard-Superposition\n Reduced-Superposition\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.12 ?

It gains even more importance when it is working with more than\n\ntwo participating species. In the case of three components, the RTE should be solved\n\n125 times applying the standard superposition method. Since the combustion system\n\nmodeling requires the consideration of even more components, the computational time\n\nincreases signi?cantly for the computation of the radiative transfer. Despite the proposed\n\nreduced superposition method working for one-dimensional problems, its validity also\n\nneeds to be evaluated for the radiative transfer solution in combustion systems such as\n\ndi?usion ?ames. Such discussion is the aim of the following section.\n\n5.2.2 Evaluation of the Consistency of the Reduced Superposition Method in\n\nDi?usion Flames\n\nThe radiative transfer prediction using the WSGG model with the reduced su-\n\nperposition method was carried out for H2O/CO2 mixtures in one-dimensional domain\n\nin the previous section. However, it is important to verify the consistency of this new\n\nproposition in combustion systems, where the H2O and the CO2 are the main combustion\n\nproducts. For this, it was chosen a laminar di?usion ?ame. The di?usive term means\n\nthat the fuel and the oxidant are not premixed.\n\nThe laminar di?usion ?ame has CH4 as fuel, without dilution, and air as oxidant.\n\nFor the evaluation of the consistency of the reduced superposition method it is necessary\n\nto know the ?elds of temperature, molar concentration of H2O and CO2, as well as the\n\npartial pressure ratio pw/pc between these species in the ?ame. As already discussed, the\n\n\n\n60\n\npartial pressures pw and pc are important for the absorption coe?cient calculation for\n\nthe gray gases. Moreover, the ratio between these partial pressures needs to be on scale\n\nwith 1 (pw/pc ? 1) over the domain for the proposed reduced superposition method to\n\nbe valid. Otherwise, if pw/pc ratio is much larger or much smaller, the proposed reduced\n\nsuperposition method may not predict accurately the radiative transfer. In such case it is\n\nnecessary to evaluate if the regions where it happens are important or not for the thermal\n\nradiation.\n\nIn Figure 5.14 it is shown the variables of interest in this analysis for the laminar\n\n?ame. There is a symmetry axis at the right vertical edge. The ?ame was simulated in\n\nthe ANSYS/Fluent 18, and the results are a courtesy of the colleague Lu\u00eds Gustavo Pires\n\nRodrigues. As can be observed in the pw/pc ?eld, there are regions where this ratio is\n\nnot on scale with 1. However, it is important to note that such regions are not relevant\n\nfrom the thermal radiation point of view. That is true because the radiative transfer is\n\nsigni?cant in the regions of high temperature and molar concentrations of the participating\n\nspecies. Thus, analyzing Figures 5.14 (a), (b) and (c), it can be seen that the regions of\n\ninterest for the thermal radiation are not coincident with those of very high and very low\n\npw/pc ratios. Thereby, even if the reduced superposition method does not work for such\n\nconditions, the regions where that happens do not have a relevant contribution in the\n\nradiative transfer calculation. Even if there are regions of high and low partial pressure\n\nratios, in average this ratio are close to 2, which is on scale with 1. To verify that, the\n\nfollowing expression can be used for the average partial pressure ratio computation in the\n\n?ame:\n\nr =\n\n?\nV\n?rdV?\n\nV\n?dV\n\n(5.10)\n\nin which ? is given as (pw + pc)T 4, being T the local temperature; and r is the local\n\npartial pressure ratio (pw/pc). The integration is made over each ?nite volume. Solving\n\nthis equation for the laminar ?ame, it yields r = 1.989, which satisfy the conditions for\n\nthe proposed reduced superposition to be valid.\n\n\n\n61\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nFigure 5.14 ? Fields of (a) temperature, (b) H2O and (c) CO2 molar concentrations, and\n\n(d) the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc) for the laminar di?usion ?ame.\n\n5.2.3 Summary\n\nIn this section was veri?ed the accuracy and the consistency of the reduced superpo-\n\nsition method proposed in this work. The radiative transfer prediction in one-dimensional\n\ndomain was performed for non-isothermal and non-homogeneous problems. In such case\n\nit was considered both the constant and the non-constant partial pressure ratio (pw/pc)\n\nover the spatial position. The proposed methodology provided solutions as accurate as\n\nthose found employing the standard superposition method, with the advantage that the\n\nnumber of times the RTE is solved was reduced by half. In addition, it was concluded\n\nthat the reduced superposition method also is valid for the radiative transfer prediction\n\nin laminar di?usion ?ames. Although this method does not work for very high and very\n\nlow pw/pc ratios, the regions where it happens in these ?ames are not important for the\n\nthermal radiation calculations.\n\n\n\n62\n\n6 CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nIn this work, the radiative transfer was computed in one-dimensional problems em-\n\nploying both the WSGG and the SLW models. The results for the radiative heat ?ux and\n\nthe heat source were compared against the LBL benchmark solution in order to evaluate\n\nthe accuracy of these models. Therefore, its was considered non-isothermal homogeneous\n\nand non-homogeneous media with di?erent temperature and concentration pro?les of the\n\nparticipating species. The ?rst step was to solve the problems for H2O and CO2 individ-\n\nually, and, next, for H2O/CO2 mixtures. The objective of doing that was to compare the\n\naccuracy of the WSGG and SLW models for several media conditions. Furthermore, the\n\nmain challenge in the superposition method is the combination of participating gases since\n\nit requires increasing computational time as the components number increase. Thus, for\n\nthe WSGG model, it was proposed a reduced superposition method capable of reducing\n\nthe computational e?ort. Its accuracy was veri?ed in one-dimensional radiative problems.\n\nFinally, the consistency of this new approach was proved in di?usion ?ames. The main\n\nconclusions of this study can be summarized as follow:\n\n\u2022 In homogeneous media, analyzing the individual species solutions, the SLW model\n\nproved to be more accurate than WSGG. For both the WSGG and the SLW models,\n\nthe H2O normalized deviations found for the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source\n\nwere expressively higher than those for CO2. When the solution was carried out for\n\nH2O/CO2 mixtures, the deviations, in average, reached values close to those found\n\nfor H2O (maximum deviations between the individual species). Further, the super-\n\nposition method applied to WSGG model, even with just four gray gases for each\n\nspecie, led to results very close to those of SLW depending on the problem under an-\n\nalyze. It shows that despite the simple formulation, the WSGG model may compete\n\nvery well with more sophisticated gas models in the solutions of thermal radiation\n\nproblems. In all the test cases, for mixtures, the Dorigon et al., 2013 coe?cients\n\nprovided the best results, which make sense since such correlations were generated\n\nspeci?cally for mixtures where the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc) is constant.\n\n\u2022 When the media is non-homogeneous, for constant partial pressure ratio, in both\n\nthe mixture and the individual species, the solutions lead to same conclusions that\n\nthose derived from homogeneous media. However, if variable partial pressure ra-\n\n\n\n63\n\ntio is considered, the disagreements between the WSGG and the SLW models are\n\nmore pronounced. The SLW model shown to be, in average, signi?cantly more\n\naccurate than WSGG for both the mixture and the individual species. Moreover,\n\nwhen Dorigon et al., 2013 coe?cients for mixture was applied provided the higher\n\ndeviation for the radiative heat source, and the better results for the radiative heat\n\n?ux. This result show that these coe?cients may be a good option even when the\n\npartial pressure ratio is not constant, depending on the result of interest, having\n\nthe advantage that it require the RTE to be solved only for four gray gases and one\n\ntransparent window, while with the superposition method the RTE was solved 25\n\ntimes in the WSGG model, and 441 times in the SLW model.\n\n\u2022 The proposed reduced superposition method applied to the WSGG model led to\n\nsolutions as good as those of the standard superposition method in the computa-\n\ntion of the radiative transfer in one-dimensional problems for both constant and\n\nnon-constant partial pressure ratio (pw/pc). Since the combination of participating\n\nspecies is the main challenge of the standard superposition method, this result is\n\nvery important for the thermal radiation prediction from combustion gases due to\n\nthe fact that the number of times need to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE)\n\nis reduced by half. In combustion system, where the thermal radiation calculation\n\nneed to be coupled with others complex mechanisms such as chemical kinetic and\n\nturbulence, this computational time reduction become of great relevance.\n\n\u2022 The consistency of the reduced superposition method in methane di?usion laminar\n\n?ames was certi?ed. Since the proposition made in this work is valid when pw/pc ?\n\n1, the ?elds of temperature, molar concentrations of H2O and CO2, and partial\n\npressure ratio (pw/pc) were analyzed. Thereby, it was veri?ed that the regions in\n\nthe ?ame where pw/pc is not in scale with 1 are not important for thermal radiation.\n\nThis phenomenon become relevant only in locations of high temperature and molar\n\nconcentrations of the participating species, and in such regions the relation pw/pc ?\n\n1 was satis?ed.\n\nThe perspectives of this work are:\n\n(i) It is important to extend the reduced superposition method to thermal radiation\n\nprediction in di?usion ?ames, and, thus, analyze the accuracy of this approach in\n\n\n\n64\n\nsuch conditions;\n\n(ii) As realized for the WSGG model, the development of a new approach for optimiza-\n\ntion of the superposition method applied to SLW model is of great interest for the\n\ncomputational e?ort reduction;\n\n(iii) Another perspective is to couple the optimized superposition method with an ade-\n\nquate approach to consider turbulence-radiation iterations (TRI) and soot formation\n\nin combustion processes.\n\n\n\n65\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAl-Omari, S.

Homogeneous media - Radiative Heat Flux and Heat Source for\n\nCases 2 and 3\n\nFigures A.1, A.2, and A.3 presents the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source for\n\na layer of CO2, H2O and H2O/CO2 mixture, respectively, for Case 2 discussed in section\n\n6.1.1. For this case, the temperature pro?le presents a double symmetric, with two points\n\nof maximum: x? = 0.25 and x? = 0.75. The maximum temperature for this case is\n\n1800 K, while the minimum is 400 K and occur in the walls and in the mid distance of\n\nthe domain. Because of the symmetry of the pro?les, the radiative heat ?ux is null in\n\nmid distance between the walls, reaching the highest absolute values at x? = 0.125 and\n\nx? = 0.825, where the temperature gradient is maximum. The maximum absolutes values\n\nof the radiative heat source occurs in the regions where the temperature pro?le has its\n\npeak; and the heat source is positive in the cold regions of the medium, indicating net\n\ngain of radiation from the hot regions. For both the individual and the mixture problems,\n\nthe WSGG radiative heat ?ux presents higher deviations near to the walls, where there\n\nare low temperatures. Furthermore, in all the problems, the SLW model leads to the\n\nmaximum deviation of the radiative heat source in the regions of maximum temperature.\n\nIn the H2O/CO2 mixture problem the WSGG radiative heat ?ux deviations shows to be\n\nvery close to those of the SLW model.\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n \n\n \n\nq\" R\n  [\n\n k\nW\n\n / \nm\n\n2  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n WSGG\n\n(a)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-300\n\n-250\n\n-200\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n \n\n \n\n- d\nq\" R\n\n  /\ndx\n\n  [\n k\n\nW\n / \n\nm\n3  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n WSGG\n\n(b)\n\nFigure A.1 ?

Contrarily to cases 1 and 2, the temperature pro?le is not symmetric,\n\nreaching its peak at x? = 0.25. The maximum temperature is still 1800 K as with the\n\nother cases, but the walls temperatures are no longer the same value: at x? = 0, T = 880\n\n\n\n76\n\nK, and x? = 1, T = 400 K. As can be seen, for all problems, since the temperature pro?le\n\nis no longer symmetric, the point in which the heat ?ux is null was no longer in the mid\n\ndistance between the walls. Moreover, for the radiative heat source, the maximum for all\n\nproblems took place in x? = 0.25, which is where the temperature of the participating\n\nspecies is at its peaks. For x? larger than about 0.6, where there is the lower temperature\n\nof the domain, the radiative heat source does not have steep variations. Analyzing the\n\ndeviations, except for H2O/CO2 (pw/pc = 2) mixture, the problems solved with the\n\nWSGG model provided the worts results than the SLW model if compared to the LBL\n\nbenchmark computation. When the results for radiative heat source is veri?ed, it is seen\n\nthat such behavior change in some cases: for H2O, the WSGG maximum deviation is\n\n11.12 %, while for SLW achieve 13.95 %; for H2O/CO2 mixture, using the superposition\n\napproach, the WSGG maximum deviation is 11.84 %, and for the SLW is 14.46 %. This\n\ninteresting fact shows that the WSGG model can compete in a satisfactory way with the\n\nmore sophisticated SLW model.\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n \n\n \n\nq\" R\n  [\n\n k\nW\n\n / \nm\n\n2  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n  WSGG\n\n(a)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n-200\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n \n\n \n\n- d\nq\"\n\nR\n /d\n\nx \n [ \n\nkW\n / \n\nm\n3  ]\n\nx [ m ]\n\n LBL\n SLW\n  WSGG\n\n(b)\n\nFigure A.4 ?
