Contudo, a \ncosta adjacente \u00e0 Ria de Aveiro est\u00e1 a sujeita a um clima de agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima \nbastante intenso, com um regime de agita\u00e7\u00e3o anual m\u00e9dio caracterizado por \nondas com altura significativa entre 2 e 2.5 m e per\u00edodos entre 9 e 11 s, \ntipicamente provenientes de WNW-NNW. Assim, \u00e9 expect\u00e1vel que a \nhidrodin\u00e2mica da embocadura dependa simultaneamente da mar\u00e9 e da ac\u00e7\u00e3o \ndas ondas.  \nApesar dos v\u00e1rios estudos hidrodin\u00e2micos realizados anteriormente sobre este \nsistema, o impacto das ondas na hidrodin\u00e2mica da embocadura nunca foi \navaliado. Assim sendo, o principal objectivo deste estudo consiste em avaliar a \ninflu\u00eancia do efeito da ondula\u00e7\u00e3o na din\u00e2mica da embocadura, quer por \nan\u00e1lise de dados observados, quer por modela\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica \nNa an\u00e1lise num\u00e9rica foi utlizado o sistema de modela\u00e7\u00e3o MORSYS2D, que \nintegra o modelo hidrodin\u00e2mico ELCIRC acoplado com o modelo de ondas \nSWAN. O modelo hidrodin\u00e2mico foi calibrado com sucesso, apresentando \nvalores de RMS e Skill que reflectem o bom desempenho do modelo. \nA metodologia utilizada para atingir os objectivos definidos consiste em for\u00e7ar \nos modelos num\u00e9ricos com os constituintes harm\u00f3nicos locais de mar\u00e9 e com \ndiferentes cen\u00e1rios de ondas t\u00edpicas do litoral norte Portugu\u00eas: um cen\u00e1rio \nnormal e outro de elevada actividade de ondas (regime de temporal). Foi \nigualmente definido um cen\u00e1rio de refer\u00eancia que consiste na aus\u00eancia do \nfor\u00e7amento das ondas. Os cen\u00e1rios foram simulados para tr\u00eas tipos distintos \nde mar\u00e9: mar\u00e9 viva, interm\u00e9dia e morta.  \nOs resultados mostram que para o cen\u00e1rio normal de agita\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima, a \nhidrodin\u00e2mica da embocadura \u00e9 essencialmente dominada pela mar\u00e9. Para o \ncen\u00e1rio de temporal, s\u00e3o encontradas sobre-eleva\u00e7\u00f5es do n\u00edvel do mar quando  \ncomparado com o cen\u00e1rio de normal actividade das ondas e com o cen\u00e1rio \nsem ondas. De facto, os resultados do modelo mostram que durante per\u00edodos \nde tempestade o n\u00edvel do mar da laguna permanece acima do n\u00edvel do mar \nobservado ao largo.    \nA an\u00e1lise do campo de correntes mostrou que as correntes induzidas pelas \nondas interagem com as correntes de mar\u00e9, alterando as suas caracter\u00edsticas, \nquer em magnitude, quer em direc\u00e7\u00e3o do fluxo predominante. Assim, devido \u00e0 \nsobre-eleva\u00e7\u00e3o, a profundidade da coluna de \u00e1gua aumenta causando um \nligeiro aumento da velocidade da corrente na zona da embocadura. \nConclui-se que embora o for\u00e7amento principal da Ria de Aveiro seja a mar\u00e9, o \nn\u00edvel do mar e as flutua\u00e7\u00f5es de velocidade na embocadura da Ria de Aveiro \ntamb\u00e9m dependem do regime de agita\u00e7\u00e3o. Consequentemente, os eventos de \ntempestade podem alterar a sua hidrodin\u00e2mica, justificando que o \nacoplamento entre as ondas e mar\u00e9s deva ser considerado de modo a \nrepresentar com precis\u00e3o os processos que dependem da din\u00e2mica de \nembocadura. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nHydrodynamic modelling, tide, waves, ELCIRC, SWAN, Ria de Aveiro, inlet \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe hydrodynamics of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon has been extensively analysed \nthrough previous observational and numerical studies, being concluded that the \ntide is the main forcing of the lagoon\u2019s hydrodynamic. However, the adjacent \ncoastal zone of Ria de Aveiro is subjected to a highly energetic wave climate, \nwith a yearly mean significant wave height of 2 - 2.5 m and wave periods of 9 - \n11 s, corresponding to WNW to NNW swell. Consequently, it should be \nexpected that the lagoon inlet hydrodynamic depends simultaneously on both \ntidal and wave regime forcing. \nDespite the several hydrodynamic studies previously performed about this \nsystem, the impact of the coastal waves in the inlet hydrodynamic has never \nbeen evaluated. Thus, the main goal of this study is to assess the influence of \nthe coastal wave regime at the inlet channel dynamics, either by observational \ndata as by numerical modeling. \nThe numerical analysis was performed through the modeling system \nMORSYS2D, which comprises the hydrodynamic model ELCIRC coupled with \nthe wave model SWAN. The hydrodynamic model was successfully calibrated \nand the RMS errors and Skill values determined reflect the good performance \nof the model.  \nThe methodology used consists in forcing the numerical models with local tidal \nharmonic constituents and with different constant regular wave scenarios \ntypical of the northern Portuguese coast: a normal and a high (storm condition) \nwave activity. A scenario with waves absence was also defined. These three \nscenarios were simulated for spring, intermediate and neap tidal conditions. \nThe results found under the wage regime forcing show that for the low wave \nactivity scenario (normal regime) the inlet hydrodynamics is mainly dominated \nby the tidal forcing. For the highest wave regime higher sea surface elevations \nat the inlet when compared with simulations performed only with tidal forcing or \nwith the normal regime are found, induced by the wave set-up. In fact, the \nmodelling results show that the lagoon sea level remains above offshore sea \nlevel during storm wave periods. \nThe currents field analysis shows that the currents induced by the waves \ninteract with the tidal currents, modifying its characteristics such as the \nmagnitude and the direction of the predominant flow. In summary, due to wave \nset-up, the water depth increases, causing a slight increase of the current \nvelocity in the inlet area. \nIs concluded that despite the tide constitute the dominant forcing of the Ria de \nAveiro inlet hydrodynamics, the sea level and current velocity fluctuations at the \nRia de Aveiro inlet also depend on the wave regime. Consequently, the storm \nevents induce important waves set-up that change the inlet hydrodynamics, \nrequiring that the coupling between waves and tides should be considered in \norder to accurately represent the processes dependent on the inlet dynamics. \n\n\n\n\n\nContents                                                                                                                                                    iv \n \n\n \n\n \nContents  \n \n\nAcknowledgements         i \n\nResumo           ii \n\nAbstract            iii \n\nLIST OF FIGURES           vi \n\nLIST OF TABLES                         viii \n\n1.

Motivation and Aims \n\n Estuaries and the adjacent coastal areas are very complex and extremely dynamic regions \n\nexposed to vast natural and anthropic pressure. The Ria de Aveiro lagoon is an evident example of this, \n\nsince it is inserted in highly populated region, harbouring important commercial and fishing ports. \n\n The coastal shoreline includes a considerable extension of lagoons and estuaries, often \n\ncharacterized by dynamic tidal inlets. These environments are normally sheltered and the wave action is \n\nminimal when compared with exposed coasts [Short, 2007; Vila-Concejo et al., 2010]. \n\n Coastal systems of this type are quite dynamic and strongly influenced by tidal action. The \n\nphysics and hydrodynamics in these systems play a major role in the development of several processes, \n\nincluding ecological, biological and sediment transport. The importance of coastal systems has been \n\nrecognized over the years, not only by the scientific community but also by the people who live around \n\nthese areas. The freshwater discharge, the entry of sea water and transport of suspended sediment and of \n\norganic and inorganic nutrients are processes that have a great importance for urban and social-economic \n\ndevelopment of surrounding estuarine regions [Miranda et al., 2002]. \n\n The scientific knowledge about these systems can be used to develop solutions to several \n\nproblems such as the hydrographic basin\u2019s changes, the identification of sedimentation areas that can \n\naffect navigation, the computation of the residence time of substances within these areas, the study of \n\nwater properties patterns to support aquaculture projects, among others [Vaz, 2007]. In terms of estuarine \n\nhydrodynamics, tidal currents structure analysis is essential to understand problems such as dispersion, \n\nrate of pollutants, sediment transport and erosion processes [Prandle, 1982]. Moreover, tidal asymmetries \n\nand residual circulation have an influence on nutrient balances, sediment loads, particles and pollutants \n\ntransportations [Aldridge, 1997]. Therefore, understanding the central processes induced by the tidal wave \n\nis crucial to obtain an overview concerning the different uses of the coastal systems. \n\n Talking further about the tidal inlets, where this work is focused, is clear that its economic and \n\nenvironmental importance has been growing worldwide. The management of these systems is no longer \n\nrestricted to the maintenance of navigation channels, but also addresses new challenges, such as the \n\nadjacent shoreline stability or the water renewal in the inner part of the system, for instance in the back \n\nbarrier lagoons which are used for aquaculture. Portuguese lagoons illustrate very well this phenomenon, \n\nsince many social and economic activities are concentrated in these coastal areas and include [Bertin et \n\nal., 2009]: \n\n? habitation and construction development on the barrier islands, despite the shoreline threat \n\nhazard; \n\n? aquaculture and fishing; \n\n? commercial maritime traffic; \n\n? recreational activities. \n\n \n\nAccording to Fitzgerald [1996], among the different types of tidal inlets, wave-dominated inlets \n\nrather occur in micro to mesotidal environments subjected to moderate to severe wave regimes. Because \n\nof the combination of wave, tides and shallow waters, wave dominated inlets are frequently extremely \n\ndynamic, with fast and considerable morphological changes. This strongly dynamic behaviour is \n\nparticularly true for several Portuguese tidal inlets, where the combination of a severe wave climate, a \n\nmesotidal range and shallow channels may result in channel migration which can reach 200 meters within \n\na few months [Oliveira et al., 2006a]. \n\n\n\nIntroduction  2 \n \n\nIn this type of inlets, changes in the sea level may be related to the tide, but also with the action \n\nof wind and waves, and with meteorological events. Therefore, direct and indirect atmospheric and marine \n\n(tide and waves) forces cause large differences and rapid changes in the physical characteristics of \n\ncoastal lagoons [Troussellier and Gattuso, 2007].  \n\nThe presence of waves can cause large differences in terms of sea-level variations [Nielsen and \n\nApelt, 2003]; their relative importance depends upon the morphology of the lagoon entrance, as well as \n\nthe local wave regime. In shallow and narrow entrances, the sea-level elevation caused by wave motion, \n\nsuch as wave breaking, is an important mechanism. This rise in sea level, or set-up, induced by waves is \n\ncommonly termed as \u2018\u2018wave set-up\u2019\u2019 [Angwenyi and Rydberg, 2005]. \n\n Thus, the main goal of this work is to study the influence of the wave regime on the \n\nhydrodynamics of Ria de Aveiro inlet through the analysis of field data and numerical model results. \n\nCombined with this primary aim, there are other specific goals such as: improve a previous implementation \n\nto Ria de Aveiro of the hydrodynamic numerical model ELCIRC, updating the lagoon bathymetry using the \n\nmost recent bathymetry data sets and consequently recalibrating the model; use MORSYS2D to couple \n\nthe wave model SWAN to ELCIRC, to make the study of the combined effects of tidal and wave regime. \n\n Consequently, this work was driven not only by the need to improve and develop the numerical \n\ntools available to study Ria de Aveiro dynamics, but also to research the influence of the coastal waves in \n\nthe lagoon hydrodynamic that has never been the subject of study in this coastal system. \n\n \n\n 1.2. State of the Art \n\nThe importance of coastal environments is recognized worldwide by the scientific community, \n\nbeing published several studies on coastal lagoons focusing its hydrology, biology, physical and chemical \n\nprocesses, among others. \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro lagoon was largely studied from a biological and chemical perspective and \n\nseveral publications regarding to bacterioplancton, zooplankton, benthic biodiversity, pollution impacts, \n\nfisheries, among several others issues were performed [e.g. Morgado et al., 2003; Lopes et al., 2010; \n\nPereira et al., 2011; Ahmad et al., in press; Anjum et al., 2012; Pires et al., in press].  Also the physical \n\nprocesses in the lagoon have been studied in the last decades. One of the first steps in this task is the \n\nstudy made by Dias et al. [1999]. The authors concluded that the tide in the Ria de Aveiro is semi-diurnal \n\nand is the main forcing agent, and M2 and S2 are the most important constituents in the lagoon, \n\nrepresenting approximately 90% of the tidal energy in Ria de Aveiro. They also showed that the lagoon \n\nshould be considered vertically homogenous, with exception to periods of important rainfalls. These \n\nhydrological characteristics may also be found in Vaz and Dias [2008] which verified that, during the winter \n\n(wet season), the stratification caused by Vouga river flow can be extended up to the inlet. \n\nThe tide in the entire lagoon was simulated by Dias et al. [2000] using a two-dimensional depth \n\nintegrated mathematical model with the aim to predict the water level and depth mean current. These \n\nauthors showed that tides propagate from the inlet and are present in the entire lagoon, decreasing its \n\namplitude with the distance to the mouth while the phase lag increases. \n\nAnother relevant study in order to understand the changes of tidal characteristics was performed \n\nby Ara\u00fajo [2005]. The author compared two different surveys (1987/8 and 2002/3) in order to analyse sea \n\nlevel changes and the amplitude and phase of the main harmonic constituents. The data showed that the \n\namplitude of the main harmonic constituents in the lagoon increased and its phase decreased. The tidal \n\nasymmetry also showed modifications over the past years. During 1987/8, the majority of the lagoon was \n\n\n\nIntroduction  3 \n \n\nflood-dominant and, since then, the central section of the Ria de Aveiro has become ebb-dominant \n\nwhereas the northern and southern sections are flood-dominant. \n\nSeveral studies based on numerical modelling were performed to investigate subjects such as the \n\ntidal propagation in the lagoon [Dias and Fernandes, 2006; Dias and Picado, 2011], the Lagrangian \n\ntransport of particles [Picado et al., 2011] and the sediment transport [Lopes et al., 2006; Lopes et al., \n\n2011b; Plecha et al., 2011; Plecha et al., 2012;]. \n\nAn important numerical study were performed by Mendes et al. [2011], that included, for the first \n\ntime in the numerical models, the low lying areas adjacent to Ria de Aveiro. The goal of this work is to \n\nevaluate if the inclusion of the low lying coastal adjacent flooded areas in the models\u2019 numerical \n\nbathymetry induce changes in model predicted hydrodynamics for the Ria de Aveiro. They found minor \n\ndifferences for the Ria de Aveiro numerically predicted general circulation when including the low lying \n\ncoastal adjacent flooded areas. \n\nRecently, Dias and Mariano [2011] evaluated the hydrodynamic response of Ria de Aveiro to an \n\nalteration on the present geometry of its inlet. It was studied the impact of the extension by 200 meters of \n\nthe north jetty of the lagoon inlet. This study shows a slightly change of the local hydrodynamic patterns, \n\nand that may induce modifications in the overall lagoon circulation related with the tidal prism decrease \n\nfound for the main channels. \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro lagoon is also source of concern when discussing climate changes impacts. \n\nSilva and Duck [2001] analysed the historical modifications of bottom topography and tidal amplitude in \n\nthe lagoon since the construction of the articial inlet and presented tendencies for future evolutions. These \n\nauthors concluded that any future increase of the mean sea level will contribute to an increase of both \n\narea and volume of water mass, increasing the speed of tidal propagation. Lopes et al. [2011a] estimated \n\nthe impact of sea level rise in lagoon hydrodynamics performing projections of SLR for the end of this \n\ncentury and found an increase of 20% of the lagoon tidal prism for a sea level rise of 0.42 m.  \n\nThe tidal prism, as well as the tidal asymmetry were also analysed by Picado et al. [2010] when \n\nexplored possible tidal changes induced by local geomorphologic changes, specially the flood caused by \n\nsalt pans walls collapse. These authors concluded that the increase of the lagoon total area (5.6% for \n\nextreme destruction) also results in an increase of 5% of the tidal prism as well as in the tidal asymmetry, \n\nwith the higher variations found close to the flooded area and in neap tide. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the influence of waves on the Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics was never \n\nstudied. However its influence in morphodynamics has already been studied. As example, Plecha et al. \n\n[2011], performed the evaluation of single waves effects on the morphologic evolution of a Ria de Aveiro \n\nlagoon inlet, concluding that the wave induced residual sediment fluxes in the cross sections upstream the \n\nlagoon mouth are smaller in magnitude than at the inlet, restricting the influence of the waves to the \n\nlagoon mouth and adjacent coastline. \n\nIn fact, the influence of waves has been weakly studied, however, there are some works studying \n\nthis subject in other Portuguese estuaries or rivers entrances. For instance, Malhadas et al. [2009] \n\nanalysed the effect of the coastal waves on sea level in \u00d3bidos lagoon and they found a correlation \n\nbetween wave height and sea-level elevation only during high wave activity periods, and the occurrence of \n\na significant super-elevation on lagoon sea level during storm wave periods. This super-elevation is \n\nexplained, not only by wave set-up or radiation stresses due to waves, but also by tidal inlet morphology. \n\nAdditionally, this subject has relevance in some systems outside Portugal. Factors governing the \n\nrelative magnitude of wave set-up at tidal inlets and river entrances have been addressed by Guza and \n\nThorton [1981], Hanslow and Nielsen [1992], Hanslow et al. [1996], Dunn et al. [2000], Tanaka et al. \n\n[2000, 2003], Dunn [2001], Oshiyama et al. [2001] and Nguyen et al. [2007]. These authors found a wave \n\n\n\nIntroduction  4 \n \n\nset-up at tidal inlets or river entrances with its magnitude dependent on the coastal system characteristics, \n\nbeing the morphology of the inlet a determinant factor to be taken into account on the wave set-up \n\ngeneration. \n\nThe most recent and consequently most importantly studies mentioned above, was the work \n\nperformed by Nguyen et al. [2007], based upon data collected in seven different morphological river \n\nentrances and one inlet, showed that the set-up, or sea-level elevation, depends not only upon offshore \n\nwave height but also on the different morphological river entrances or tidal inlets. These authors found a \n\ncorrelation between wave set-up height and water depth of the entrance, concluding that the wave set-up \n\nheight is inversely proportional to the average water depth, at a river entrance or inlet. \n\nDifferent numerical models have been used to study the Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. The first \n\nnumerical used to study the physical characteristics of Ria de Aveiro lagoon was SYMSYS2D model \n\n[Leendertse and Gritton, 1971]. Dias et al. [2000] used this numerical model to study the tidal propagation \n\nin Ria de Aveiro. Thenceforward, this model was used by several authors to study the Ria de Aveiro \n\nlagoon [Dias et al. 2003; Dias and Mariano, 2011]. More recently the lagoon has been characterized with \n\nother numerical models. As example, Vaz et al. [2005] and Vaz et al. [2007] used a 3D baroclinic model, \n\nMohid [www.mohid.com], to study the importance of the river flow in the establishment of thermohaline \n\nhorizontal patterns.  Other numerical model usually used to study the lagoon hydrodynamics is ELCIRC \n\nmodel. Oliveira et al. [2006b] resorted to this model to analyse the tidal propagation in Ria de Aveiro \n\nlagoon and the variability of tidal asymmetry in the upper and lower lagoon. Posteriorly, several authors \n\napplied this numerical model in Ria de Aveiro [Picado 2008; Lopes 2009; Picado et al. 2010]. \n\nIn this study, it was used the 2DH morphodynamic modeling system MORSYS2D. This modelling \n\nsystem integrates the hydrodynamic model ELCIRC [Zang et al., 2004], the wave model SWAN [Booij et \n\nal., 1999], and the model SAND2D [Fortunato and Oliveira, 2004]. In this study, the module SAND2D was \n\nnot activated. This modeling system has been already successfully applied in some previous studies in \n\nRia de Aveiro. As example, Lopes et al. [2011a] used this numerical tool to study the local sea level \n\nchange scenarios for the end of the 21st century and potential physical impacts in the lower Ria de Aveiro. \n\n[Plecha et al. 2011, 2012] also used this modeling system to study the Ria de Aveiro morphodynamics.  \n\n \n\n 1.3. Work Structure \n\n For an overall understanding of the items studied and mentioned in this work, some of the main \ncharacteristics of estuaries and lagoons were previously presented, as well as some important studies \n\nconcerning the Ria de Aveiro and the effect of the coastal waves propagation inside the tidal inlets and \n\nriver entrances. \n\n The second chapter includes the description of the main characteristics of the study area (Ria de \n\nAveiro) in order to understand their principal morphologic and hydrodynamic features. A characterization \n\nof the wave and wind climate is also present in this chapter. The chapter three contains the description of \n\nthe numerical models used in this work, ELCIRC and SWAN. The methodology adopted in this study and \n\nthe results of the hydrodynamic model calibration are also present. \n\n In the chapter four are presented the results of this work, that includes the analyses of field data \n\nand the analysis of the results of the numerical model simulations. Finally, in chapter five are presented \n\nthe most important ideas discussed in this work, as well as the main conclusions.   \n\n\n\nStudy Area  5 \n \n\n2. Study Area \n\n 2.1. General Description \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is the most extensive in Portugal [Teixeira, 1994] shallow coastal \n\nlagoon located on the northwest coast of Portugal, being separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a sand \n\ndune barrier. It has an irregular geometry, and its only connection with Atlantic Ocean is through an \n\nartificial channel, constructed in 1808 [Dias, 2001, Dias and Mariano, 2011]. The lagoon has a maximum \n\nwidth of 8.5 km and a length of 45 km, being constituted by four main channels: Mira, S\u00e3o Jacinto, \u00cdlhavo \n\nand Espinheiro channels. The Mira channel is an elongated shallow arm, with 14 km length. S. Jacinto \n\nchannel is about 29 km long, and \u00cdlhavo and Espinheiro are 15 and 17 km, respectively [Dias, 2001]. \n\nThe system is also characterized by a large number of channels between which lie significant \n\nintertidal areas, essentially mudflats, salt marshes and old salt pans [Picado et al., 2010]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 1. The Ria de Aveiro lagoon \n\n\n\nStudy Area  6 \n \n\n The Ria de Aveiro is a very important ecosystem to the local economy and to the environment. It \n\nacts as keystone to the local agriculture, holds a large number of small traditional fishing ports, houses the \n\nAveiro\u2019s Harbour, has aquaculture activities, it is an important place for the tourism with a growing \n\nsubsector in the water sports area and it\u2019s also related to the traditional salt production activities [Alves et \n\nal., 2011]. \n\n From the nature conservation and biodiversity point of view, it is a great value area, both locally \n\nand nationally. It has a rich fauna and flora housing a large number of species. Due to rich variety of \n\nspecies the Aveiro lagoon was classified as a Special Protected Area, a classification that comes from the \n\napplication of the Birds Directive. It contains also an important protected area, the Natural Reserve of \n\n\u2018Dunas de S\u00e3o Jacinto\u2019. A well preserved dune barrier located in the seaside area of the lagoon with \n\nseveral ponds that present themselves as an essential habitat for numerous local and migratory birds. \n\n[Alves et al., 2011]. \n\n \n\n 2.2. Physical and Hydrodynamic Description \n\n As mentioned before, the Ria de Aveiro is the most extensive lagoon in Portugal and it has a very \n\ncomplex and irregular geometry, composed by long and narrow channels, with a large longitudinal \n\ndevelopment, characterized by extensive intertidal areas, essentially mudflats, salt marsh and old \n\nsaltpans. Consequently, the physical processes that occur in the system are also quite complex. \n\n The area of the lagoon has a large variability according with the tidal influence in its \n\nhydrodynamics. In spring tides the lagoon area reaches a maximum area of 83 km2 at high tide, which \n\ndecreases to a minimum of 66 km2 at low tide. The average depth in Ria de Aveiro is about 1 meter, \n\nrelative to local datum, although the inlet channel can exceed 30 meters deep, due to dredging operations \n\nthat are frequently carried out to allow the navigation [Dias and Lopes, 2006a]. \n\n  The main forcing agent driving water circulation in Ria de Aveiro is the tide, which is mesotidal, \n\npresenting an average tidal amplitude at the inlet of 2 meters, and amplitudes of 0.6 meters in neap tides \n\nand 3.2 meters in spring tides [Dias 2001; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2008]. Several authors evaluated the tidal prism \n\nfor the Ria de Aveiro lagoon through different numerical models (considering different bathymetries), and \n\nseveral values were obtained. For maximum spring tide Dias [2001] and Lopes et al. [2006] estimate \n\n136.7\u00d7106 m3, Picado et al. [2010] 86.3\u00d7106 m3 and Lopes et al. [2010] 87.5\u00d7106 m3 and for minimum \n\nneap tide Dias [2001] and Lopes et al. [2006] estimated 34.9\u00d7106 m3, Picado et al. [2010] 31.0\u00d7106 m3 and \n\nLopes et al. [2010] 28.9\u00d7106 m3. These values of tidal prism were computed in a flooding cycle, thus the \n\nflux related to these ranges are 3.87 to 6.12\u00d7103 m3s-1 for spring tide and 1.30 to 1.56\u00d7103 m3s-1 for neap \n\ntide. These values are much higher when compared with the total freshwater input in a tidal cycle. Moreira \n\net al. [1993] projected an input of nearly 1.8\u00d7106 m3. The tidal prism of each channel relative to it its value \n\nat the mouth is: 35.4% for S. Jacinto channel, 25.6% for Espinheiro channel, 10.0% for Mira channel and \n\n13.5% for \u00cdlhavo channel [Dias and Picado, 2011]. Likewise, the semidiurnal tides are the main factor \n\ninfluencing the hydrodynamics of the lagoon [Dias et al., 2000]. Thus, the most important harmonic \n\nconstituents in Ria de Aveiro are M2 and S2, corresponding of about 88% and 10% of total tidal energy, \n\nrespectively [Dias, 2001]. \n\n The lagoon has five main rivers, one for each channel: Vouga, Antu\u00e3, Caster, Boco and Ribeira \n\ndos Moinhos, being the most important the Vouga river. According with Ria de Aveiro Polis Litoral \n\nprogram, which considered the data present in the Plano de Bacia Hidrogr\u00e1fica (www.arhcentro.pt), the \n\nmean freshwater inflow for Vouga River is 60.0 m3s-1, 4.5 m3s-1 for Antu\u00e3, 1.6 m3s-1 for Caster, and 1.0 and \n\n3.6 m3s-1 for Boco and Ribeira dos Moinhos, respectively.  \n\n\n\nStudy Area  7 \n \n\n Additionally to the tidal forcing, and in extreme situations, also the wind and freshwater discharge \n\n(mainly the Vouga river) influence the Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. During strong freshwater flows, the \n\nlagoon is characterized as weakly stratified [Vaz and Dias, 2008]. Wind is very significant in Aveiro \n\nconsidering periods from a few hours to a few days, when can become an important influence on lagoon \n\ncirculation. Extreme conditions of strong wind may induce particular circulation patterns mainly in shallow \n\nareas and wide channels [Dias, 2001]. \n\n 2.3. Wave and Wind Characterization \n\n The wave and wind characterization was based in two technical reports of Plano de \nOrdenamento da Orla Costeira [Dias et al., 2011a; Dias et al., 2011b].  In summary, the analysis \n\npresented in this subsection is used to establish regimes of typical wind and wave climate, as well as the \n\nexceptional regimes (storms). Thus, this knowledge will allow the establishment of scenarios to perform \n\nthe numerical simulations in the frame of the research topics to be developed in this study. \n\n 2.3.1. Wave Characterization \n\nThe characterization of the wave regime was performed by analysing records of the Figueira da \n\nFoz wave directional buoy (40\u00b011.13\u2019 N; 9\u00b08.73\u2019 W, depth 92m ZH). The data was collected by the \n\nPortuguese Hydrographic Institute (IH) and is available on the website. The station is located 50 km South \n\nof Aveiro, however it is possible to say that there are no important variations in the wave regime in this \n\nspatial difference [Coli, 2003]. Therefore, in this work, it will considered that the wave regime in Figueira \n\nda Foz is representative of the region of Aveiro. The buoy data are comprised between 1984 and 1996. \n\nIn more detail, through the buoy data analysis of the rose of directions shows that the waves have \n\na predominance from the Northwest quadrant (Figure 2). The higher frequency of occurrence, \n\ncorresponding to the sector NW, is equivalent to 41% of the percentage of records, and then the sectors \n\nWNW and NNW have a frequency of occurrence of 29% and 18%, respectively. The combination of \n\nfrequency of occurrence of direction and Hs, also presented in Figure 2, illustrates that the highest waves \n\noccur at west-northwest direction, albeit with small percentage of occurrence. \n\nThe distribution in classes of the significant wave height (Figure 3) shows that the class of \n\nsignificant height between 0.5 - 1.0 meters is dominant in the Portuguese coast with 40% frequency of \n\noccurrence, followed by class 1.5 - 2.5 meters with 35%. In continuity with the downward trend are the \n\nfollowing classes, 2.5 - 3.5 and 3.5 - 4.5 meters, with frequencies of occurrence of 16% and 6%, \n\nrespectively. With frequencies lower than 1% are found classes of significant height smaller than 0.5 m \n\nand higher than 5.5 meters. The waves with Hs higher than 5.5 meters represent the storm events. \n\n The analysis of the distribution of the wave period (Figure 4) reveals that the most frequent \n\nperiods of the waves in the Portuguese coast lie between 5 and 9 seconds, occurring with 77% of \n\nfrequency. Within this range, the dominant class, with 23% of the frequency of occurrence, is 6 - 7 \n\nseconds, followed by the class between 7 - 8 seconds with 20% of occurrences. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nStudy Area  8 \n \n\n  \n\nHs (m) \n\nFigure 2.

Frequency of occurrence (%) of each class of wave period. \n\n\n\nStudy Area  9 \n \n\n Several storm events that were characterized by Hs higher than 5 meters and wave period higher \n\nthan 10 seconds affects the study area during winter and transition periods. According to Pires [1985], \n\nthere are two types of storm events. The first corresponds to exceptionally strong NW or SW swells that \n\naffected the area for one to two days. Several of these storm events are experienced each year, and are \n\nthe most common types of storm that occur during the winter and transition periods of the western Iberian \n\ncoast. The most severe of these storms can generate wave conditions with significant wave heights of up \n\nto 7.5 meters and wave peak periods of about 16.5 seconds. The second type of storm event is \n\ncharacterized by a succession of highly energetic storms that affect the western Iberian area for one to \n\ntwo weeks. These occur when the Azores anticyclone is situated at its most extreme southerly position \n\n(~30\u00b0N), allowing the transit of eastward-moving synoptic perturbations to the northern Iberian latitudes. \n\nThese conditions, known as \u2018westerly storms\u2019, typically occur once per year and generate the most \n\nextreme wave conditions observed on the northern Portuguese shelf, mainly associated with a southerly \n\nwind regime [Pires, 1985]. \n\nIn contrast to winter conditions, in the summer the wave regime is characterized by low energy \n\nconditions. From June to September, significant wave heights mean periods and peak periods are \n\nconsistently smaller than 3 meters, 8 and 12 seconds, respectively. The monthly averages and standard \n\ndeviations of the wave parameters are at their lowest values between June and August. In August, \n\nsignificant wave heights are smaller than 3 meters [Vitorino et al., 2002]. \n\n \n\n 2.3.2. Wind Characterization \n\nThe characterization of the wind field was performed through the analysis and representation of \n\nmonitored data from the meteorological station \u2018Casal do Rato\u2019 (http://snirh.pt). The station is located in \n\nFigueira da Foz (40\u00b009'12.52'' N, 8\u00b050'36.07'' W), 50 km South of Aveiro. However in this study, the wind \n\nof the station \u2018Casal do Rato\u2019 is considered representative of the wind in the region of Aveiro. Wind \n\nintensity and the percentage of occurrence of each direction for all the records and seasonally (Spring, \n\nSummer, Autumn and Winter) are represented. The date of station data are between the years 2001 and \n\n2009. \n\nThe most representative values of wind speed are between 0 and 8 ms-1, while maximum values \n\nare around 18 ms-1. Relatively to the prevailing wind direction, it should be noted that in the wind rose is \n\nshown the place where the wind blows. Thus, a typical North wind is represented in the wind roses in the \n\nlower quadrants. Therefore, the analysis of Figure 5 shows that the prevailing winds are from Northwest \n\n(NW) and Southeast (SE). In more detail, about 37% of the wind records are from NW quadrant, 27% \n\ncomes from SE quadrant, 22% from NE quadrant, and finally, 15% from SW. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nVelocity (ms\n-1\n\n) \n\nFigure 5.

Note that the months of March, April and May are considered as Spring, June, July \n\nand August as Summer, September, October and November as Autumn, and finally, December, January \n\nand February as Winter. \n\n In Spring about 60% of the wind records are northerly, with considerable speed, especially the \n\nwinds coming from NW.

This phenomenon is even more evident in the Summer months, with about \n\n70% of wind records coming from the North, with maximum speeds of 18 ms-1. During these months, the \n\nwind that comes from South is typically weaker, with maximum values of 8 ms-1. \n\n The patterns observed for Autumn and Winter are quite similar, showing higher frequency of wind \n\nrecords from the NW and SE quadrant. For the Autumn months, 35% of the winds are from the SE and \n\n30% from NW. Already in the Winter months, 35% of the wind comes from the SE quadrant and 25% \n\ncomes from NW.

Numerical Models and Methodology \n\nThe numerical simulations were performed with the 2DH morphodynamic modeling system \n\nMORSYS2D [Fortunato and Oliveira, 2004]. This modelling system integrates the hydrodynamic model \n\nELCIRC [Zang et al., 2004], which calculates tidal elevations and currents, the wave model SWAN [Booij \n\net al., 1999], which computes wave propagation and the model SAND2D [Fortunato and Oliveira, 2004] \n\nthat computes sand transports and updates the bottom topography. In this study, the module SAND2D \n\nwas not activated. A brief description of each model component used in this study is presented in the \n\nfollowing subsections. \n\n  \n\n 3.1. Hydrodynamic Numerical Model (ELCIRC) \n\nELCIRC (www.stccmop.org/CORIE/modeling/elcirc/index.html) is a model developed for the \n\neffective simulation of three dimensional baroclinic circulation across river-to-ocean scales. The model \n\nELCIRC uses a finite-volume/finite difference Eulerian-Lagrangian algorithm to solve the set of six \n\nhydrostatic equations based on the Boussinesq approximation: mass conservation, momentum \n\nconservation and conservation of salt and heat, addressing a wide range of physical processes and of \n\natmospheric, ocean and river forcings [Zhang et al. 2004]. A finite volume technique conservation and \n\nnatural treatment of wetting and drying are used to solve the model equations. The horizontal domain is \n\ndiscretized with a triangular mesh for flexibility. A semi-implicit time-stepping algorithm and the \n\nLagrangean treatment of advective terms ensure stability at large time steps [Oliveira et al., 2006b]. \n\nWithin MORSYS2D, the hydrodynamic model solves the equations in order to determine the free \n\nsurface elevation, 3D water velocity, salinity and temperature. In Ria de Aveiro, a single layer is adopted, \n\nso the model reverts from 3 dimensions into 2 dimensions. The depth-integrated equations solved in this \n\nmodel express the conservation of mass and momentum: \n\n \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n)()(\n\ny\n\nV\n\nx\n\nV\n\ny\ngfU\n\ny\n\nV\nV\n\nx\n\nV\nU\n\nt\n\nV\n\ny\n\nU\n\nx\n\nU\n\nx\ngfV\n\ny\n\nU\nV\n\nx\n\nU\nU\n\nt\n\nU\n\ny\n\nHV\n\nx\n\nHU\n\nt\n\nsyby\n\nsxbx\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\n?\n\n \n\n \n\nwhere H is the total depth, U and V are the depth averaged velocity components in the x (eastward) and y \n\n(northward) directions, bx? , by?  are the bottom stress in x and y directions, sx? , sy?  are the surface \n\nstress in x and y directions, t is the time, g is the acceleration of gravity, ?  is the water density, ?  is the \n\nhorizontal eddy viscosity. \n\n There are several options of forcing agents in ELCIRC within MORSYS2D: tides, tidal potential, \n\nriver flow and wind or waves-induced radiation stresses.

Wave Model (SWAN) \n\nSWAN is a third generation wave prediction model used to represent wave conditions in coastal \n\nand near-shore waters. This model has been extensively used for environmental impact assessment \n\nstudies, sediment transport studies, near-shore wave prediction. The free surface elevation in SWAN is \n\ndescribed in terms of action density (or energy density in the absence of currents). The energy balance \n\nequation gives a statistical description of the time evolution of surface gravity waves [Booij et al., 1999]. \n\nThe wave model SWAN [Booij et al., 1999] computes the evolution of the wave spectrum by \n\nsolving the spectral action balance equation adapted to near shore zones, given in Cartesian coordinates \n\nby Equation 13. \n\n \n\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nN\n\nS\nNcNcNc\n\ny\nNc\n\nx\nN\n\nt\nyx\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n??\n \n\n \n\nin which ?  is the wave frequency (s-1), ?  the wave angle (radians), N the wave action density (m), xc , \n\ny\nc  the wave propagation speeds in x and y directions (ms-1) and S the energy source term (ms-2). \n\nThe first term is the local rate of change of action density with respect to time. The second and \n\nthird terms represent the propagation of the group velocity over a cartesian grid ( xc  and yc  are the \n\ngroup velocity in x and y space). The fourth term accounts for the shifting of the relative frequency of \n\nwaves due to variations in depth and currents. The fifth term is the refraction and propagation due to the \n\ndepths and currents in the directional space ( ?c and ?c  are in spectral space). The right side of the \n\nequation incorporates S, which is the total of all source and sink terms in the form of energy density. \n\nThe model SWAN also accounts for depth-induced wave breaking and triad wave-wave \n\ninteractions which is important for near-shore wave predictions. The inherent physical processes \n\naccounted in SWAN comprises the parameterization of wind input, non-linear wave-wave interaction, \n\nwhite-capping dissipation, bottom interaction, changes due to variation in water depth and effect of \n\ncurrents [Arora et al., 2012]. In this study, the white-capping dissipation was not taken into account. \n\n \n\n 3.2.1 Wave Model Setup \n\nIn the present study two nested grids are used in the wave model with different dimensions and \n\ncharacteristics, as reported in Plecha [2011] and Plecha et al., [2012]. The grid with higher dimensions \n\nextends from the offshore area with a coarser resolution. In this grid are imposed the waves boundary \n\nconditions: a regular monochromatic wave or a wave regime. The second grid encompassing the inlet \n\narea is curvilinear in space and with finer resolution. The calibration of SWAN was performed by Plecha \n\n[2011], by comparing model predictions with buoy records at Leix\u00f5es (41\u00b019'00\"N, 8\u00b059'00\"W). \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n(13) \n\n\n\nNumerical Models and Methodology  14 \n \n\n 3.3. Model Establishment and Hydrodynamic Model Calibration \n\n This study starts with the improvement of the previous implementation of the hydrodynamic \nmodel ELCIRC performed by Picado [2008], in order to understand the consequences of the partial salt \n\npans walls destruction on the entire Ria de Aveiro lagoon hydrodynamics. The author used a bathymetry \n\nwith topo-hydrographic data mainly from 1987/88 collected by Portuguese Hydrographic Institute (I.H). \n\nThe exception is the inlet area where the bathymetry were updated with 2001 data, collected by the \n\nAdministration of the Ria de Aveiro (A.P.A.). \n\n Is known that the depth and the morphology of the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro changed \n\nconsiderably since 1987/88 until nowadays. For that reason and in order to represent the physical \n\nprocesses in the lagoon with more recent data, the bathymetry developed by Picado [2008] was updated, \n\nconstituting the first step of this study. \n\n Thus, the new bathymetry is composed by a \n\ncompilation of 3 different topo-hydrographic data (POLIS \n\n2011 collected by Ria de Aveiro Polis Litoral program; A.P.A \n\n2010 data, collected by Administration of the Ria de Aveiro \n\nin the year 2010 and finally, the data of I.H 1987/88 also \n\npresent in the bathymetry used by Picado [2008]). Thus, as \n\nillustrated in Figure 7, the bathymetry in the inlet area was \n\nupdated with the data collected by A.P.A in 2010. The \n\nmajority of the S.Jacinto channel was updated with POLIS \n\n2011 data, however, in some channels in the upstream zone \n\nof the S.Jacinto channel, the bathymetry is from 1987/88. \n\n In the downstream zone of Mira channel, the \n\nbathymetry was updated with A.P.A 2010 data, while in the \n\nremaining channel, the data used to update the bathymetry \n\nwas POLIS 2011 data. \n\n  With the exception of the downstream area that \n\nwas updated with A.P.A data, the \u00cdlhavo channel was mainly \n\nupdated with POLIS 2011 data. \n\n Since the downstream area until the middle zone of \n\nthe Espinheiro channel, the bathymetry was updated with \n\nPOLIS recent data. The upstream zone of the channel keeps \n\nwith the data of 1987/88. \n\n The analysis of Figure 7 allows affirm that the \n\nprincipal zones of the main channels were updated with \n\nmore recent data. \n\n  The two bathymetries (the bathymetry used by \n\nPicado [2008] and bathymetry created in this study) are \n\nrepresented in Figure 8, and the zoom of the inlet zone \n\n(study area) is also in the figure. The numerical bathymetries \n\nare referent to average mean sea level (2 m). The main difference between them is the deepening visible \n\nin the new bathymetry when compared with the bathymetry used by Picado [2008]. This is mainly \n\nFigure 7.

It is numerical discretized with 87747 elements and 66092 nodes. This grid includes, with \n\nhigh resolution, all the channels in the interior of the lagoon, however without high resolution in offshore \n\nand inlet regions. Therefore, after some numerical runs, it was concluded that this grid has insufficient \n\nresolution in offshore zone to represent accurately the coastal waves propagation.  \n\n Therefore, it was necessary integrate the grid with higher resolution in the offshore and inlet \n\nareas developed by Plecha [2011] in order to study the morphodynamic in the Ria de Aveiro inlet. It is \n\nnumerical discretized with 43169 elements and 25819 nodes. Due to the focus of the study (inlet area) \n\nperformed by Plecha [2011], in this grid is excluded some interior channels of Ria de Aveiro. Thus, the \n\nfinal grid (C) is a merging of a grid with high resolution in the ocean area (A) with a grid with a high \n\nresolution in the lagoon area (B), as represented in Figure 9. Thus, this grid allows studying accurately the \n\nprocesses that occur in the inlet without neglecting the interiors channels of Ria de Aveiro. The final grid \n\nhas 103515 elements and 74094 nodes, and is illustrated in the bottom panel of the figure (C). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 9.

The \n\nhydrodynamic model ELCIRC was forced by eleven harmonic constituents (MSF, O1, K1, N2, M2, S2, M4, \n\nMN4, MS4, M6 and 2MS6) obtained from the regional model of Fortunato et al. [2002]. The largest time step \n\nthat prevents the appearance of oscillations was set to 90 seconds.  \n\n The calibration of the hydrodynamic model is based on the adjustments of parameters to which \n\nthe model is most sensitive. According to Dias and Fernandes [2006], the magnitude of the bottom friction \n\ncoefficient induces changes in the tidal wave propagation within the Ria de Aveiro. The water depth \n\ninfluences strongly the bottom stress. Therefore, based in previous works [Dias and Lopes, 2006a,b; Dias \n\net al. 2009; Picado et al., 2011], it was decided to use the Manning coefficient dependent of the depth as \n\ncalibration parameter. Several model runs were performed to calibrate the numerical model, by adjusting \n\nthe bottom stress in order to reduce the differences between the available data and model results, \n\nreaching the relationship showed in Table 1. The Manning coefficients were adjusted using the guideline \n\nthat an increase in the bottom friction will induce a decrease in the tidal wave amplitude in that zone, and \n\nvice-versa. Another principle used is that an increase in the bottom friction will lead an increase in the \n\nphase lag for high tide and a decrease for low tide [Fry and Aubrey, 1990].  \n\n \n\nDepth (meters) Manning n values \n\nh ? -0.5 \n\n-0.5 ? h ? 0.0 \n\n0.0 ? h ? 0.5 \n\n0.5 ? h ? 1.0 \n\n1.0 ? h ? 3.0 \n\n3.0 ? h ? 6.0 \n\n  6.0 ? h ? 10.0 \n\nh ? 10.0 \n\n0.029 \n\n0.027 \n\n0.026 \n\n0.023 \n\n0.020 \n\n0.016 \n\n0.015 \n\n0.014 \n\n \n\n The model was calibrated following the methodology proposed by Dias and Lopes (2006a), by \n\ninitially comparing visually the observed sea surface elevation data with the hydrodynamic model results. \n\nFor the model calibration, the data available are from field works carried out in Ria de Aveiro in the years \n\n2003 and 2004. Field data were collected in the framework of the Ara\u00fajo [2005] PhD Thesis and the \n\nmeasurements were performed every six minutes, with the exception of the Barra station, where the \n\nmeasurements were performed every hour. It is important to note that, in order to compare model results \n\nwith measurements, the low frequency signal was removed from the data, considering a cut-off frequency \n\nof 0.0000093 Hz (30 h). This method has already been adopted in previous studies [Picado, 2008]. \n\n The hydrodynamic model calibration is performed at 18 stations within the lagoon (Figure 10). \n\nThe predicted and observed time series of sea surface elevation comparison is shown in Figures 11 and \n\n12. After comparing visually the observed sea surface elevation data with the hydrodynamic model results, \n\nthe model performance was quantified by Root Mean Square (RMS) errors and Skill parameter (Table 2), \n\ngiven by:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Based in Dias et al. \n\n[2009], the RMS values should be compared with the local tidal amplitude and if those errors are lower \n\nthan 5% of the local amplitude, the agreement between model results and observations should be \n\nconsidered excellent and if they range between 5% and 10% the agreement should be considered very \n\ngood. The model predictive Skill, a method developed by Wilmott [1981] and used initially by Warner et al. \n\n[2005] and Li et al. [2005], yield a Skill of one for a perfect agreement between model results and \n\nobservations and zero for a complete disagreement. Skill values higher than 0.95 should be considered \n\nrepresentative of an excellent agreement between model results and observations [Dias et al., 2009]. \n\nIt was also performed the comparison between \n\nthe observed and predicted amplitude and phase of the \n\nmain tidal constituents determined from harmonic \n\nanalysis is also performed, in order to quantify \n\nseparately the amplitude and phase lags of the major \n\ntidal constituents for the all monitoring stations (Figure \n\n13). In this work the harmonic analysis is performed \n\nusing Pawlowicz et al. [2002] package. \n\n  \n\nFigure 10.

Results \n\n With the exception of the stations E, M, K and J, the RMS values ranges from 2.5% to 13.3% of \n\nthe local amplitude in all stations. The stations B, F, G, H, I, L, N, O, P, Q and R have a RMS value \n\nbetween 0 and 10%. Thus, the agreement between predictions and observations, in the most of the \n\nstations, ranges from very well to excellent. For the stations E, M, K and J located on the North of the \n\nlagoon, the agreement between model and observations are lower comparing with other previous studies \n\n[Picado, 2008]. In the analysis of the calibration results, it is important to note that, in this study, is \n\ncompared field data from 2003 with modelling results of the year 2011. Is known, through several \n\npublications, including Ara\u00fajo et al., [2008], which over the years, the tidal range in the Ria de Aveiro has \n\nbeen increased, and the phase is decreasing. Thus, it is likely that these patterns will be visible in the time \n\nseries of SSE, and in the comparison of the amplitude and phase of the main harmonics constituents. In \n\nthese stations (E, M, K and J), the patterns identified by Ara\u00fajo et al., [2008] are amplified, leading a \n\nhighest disagreement between predictions and observations. \n\n  \n\nStation RMS Skill \n\nA \n\nB \n\nC \n\nD \n\nE \n\nF \n\nG \n\nH \n\nI \n\nJ \n\nK \n\nL \n\nM \n\nN \n\nO \n\nP \n\nQ \n\nR \n\n0.1990 \n\n0.0759 \n\n0.2796 \n\n0.3745 \n\n0.3931 \n\n0.1698 \n\n0.0924 \n\n0.2102 \n\n0.1738 \n\n0.3383 \n\n0.5092 \n\n0.1628 \n\n0.4540 \n\n0.2210 \n\n0.1309 \n\n0.1851 \n\n0.1528 \n\n0.3150 \n\n0.9252 \n\n0.9905 \n\n0.9470 \n\n0.8866 \n\n0.7625 \n\n0.9873 \n\n0.9962 \n\n0.9719 \n\n0.9859 \n\n0.8167 \n\n0.6521 \n\n0.9879 \n\n0.6960 \n\n0.9724 \n\n0.9911 \n\n0.9756 \n\n0.9812 \n\n0.9084 \n\nTable 2.

The RMS is approximately 7 cm, \n\nwhich represents an error of 2.5% when compared with local tidal amplitude. This small error may partially \n\nexplain the errors found in the other stations within the lagoon. In stations B, F, G, L and O the \n\ndisagreement is lower than 5% of local tidal range. In general, the errors increase with the distance \n\nbetween the station and the lagoon mouth. \n\nThe time series represented in Figures 11 and 12 shows that the model results predicts a global \n\nincrease of tidal amplitude since 2003 to 2011 and a slight phase lag between predictions and \n\nobservations leading to an increase of the RMS. However, these patterns are in agreement with Ara\u00fajo et \n\nal. [2008]. \n\nWith the exception of the stations D, E, J, K and M, the skill values are always higher than 0.90. \n\nAll of these stations are in the upstream zone of the channels, where the model has lower agreement with \n\nthe observations. The stations B, F, G, H, I, L, N, O, P and Q have skill values greater than 0.95, thus it \n\nshould be considered as an excellent agreement between model results and observations. \n\n  Figure 11.

Comparison between observations and model results of SSE time series from station I \n\nuntil R, used in the hydrodynamic calibration procedure (? red circles: data; black solid line: model). \n\n\n\nNumerical Models and Methodology  22 \n \n\n The analysis of the tidal constituents reveals that the M2 and S2 are the most important \n\nconstituents in the lagoon, representing approximately 90% of the tidal energy in Ria de Aveiro lagoon in \n\nagreement with Dias et al. [1999]. The tidal constituent comparison shows major disagreement at the \n\nupstream stations.  \n\n The analysis of these results shows that the mean amplitude difference, in all stations, for the M2 \n\nconstituent is about 9 cm, and the mean phase difference is about 10\u00ba. This value corresponds to a \n\ndifference of about 20 minutes in the arrival of tidal wave. In the station B, this difference is much smaller \n\nthan the average value (less than 6 minutes in phase and 0.15 cm in amplitude). For the S2 constituent, \n\nthe mean amplitude difference is approximately 4 cm and phase difference is 10\u00ba, which means that the \n\naverage delay is about 29 minutes. At station B, the difference in amplitude is 8 cm and in the phase is \n\n1.8\u00ba, corresponding to 3.7 minutes. \n\n For diurnal constituents (O1 and K1), the results are similar when compared with the semi-diurnal \n\nconstituents, but with higher disagreement. The apparent error present in the O1 phase at stations C, H \n\nand P is because of the adopted graphic scale. For the O1 constituent, the mean amplitude difference \n\ncorresponds to 0.79 cm and the mean phase difference is 48\u00ba, which means that the average delay is \n\nabout 207 minutes. However, in Barra station it is observed a better agreement between model and \n\nobservations, with an average of amplitude difference of about 0.26 cm and phase delay about 14 \n\nminutes. The mean amplitude difference for K1 constituent is about 1.3 cm and the mean phase difference \n\nis approximately 60\u00ba, corresponding to 239 minutes. For station B (Barra), the amplitude difference is 0.25 \n\ncm and the phase difference is 6\u00ba, corresponding to a delay of 25 minutes. \n\n The M4 is a harmonic constituent which characterises a short-period harmonic term in order to \n\ntake into account the change in the form of a tidal wave resulting from shallow water condition. In shallow \n\nwaters the progression of a tidal wave is changed by numerous physical factors which depend on the \n\nsquare or higher powers of the tidal amplitudes [Pugh, 1996]. The mean amplitude difference, in all \n\nstations, for the M4 constituent is about 6 cm while the mean phase difference is 69\u00ba, which corresponds to \n\n71 minutes. In the most important station for this study, the difference in amplitude is 0.47 cm and the \n\nphase delay is about 30 minutes. The M4 constituent amplitude and phase was not reproduced with the \n\nexpected accuracy. The errors found in this constituent reproduction may be due to bathymetric errors that \n\ncannot be corrected by the adjustment of the bottom coefficient and because it was not considered the low \n\nlying areas adjacent to Ria de Aveiro. \n\n According to the RMS and Skill results obtained, it may be considered that the model reproduces \n\naccurately the SSE data, and consequently the tidal processes in the lagoon. The numerical results \n\nobtained for the study area (inlet) should be considered in excellent agreement with the observed data. \n\nRelatively to the harmonic analysis, the observations and predictions has a good agreement, essentially in \n\nsemi-diurnal constituents (the most important). In Barra station, area where this study is focused, the \n\nresults are very good. Therefore it may be concluded that the hydrodynamic model is calibrated and able \n\nto reproduce the tidal processes in the area of interest for this study.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nNumerical Models and Methodology  23 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 13.

Analyses of Field Data of SSE, Hs and Atmospheric Pressure  \n\n In this subchapter, will be present the methodology used to relate the field data of Hs with over-\n\nelevations in Sea Surface Elevation (SSE), from the Barra tidal gauge (40\u00b038.5\u2019N, 8\u00b044.92\u2019W). The data \n\navailable of Hs is from the Leix\u00f5es Buoy comprised between 1984 and 1996. In this case, the analysis is \n\ndone considering the Leix\u00f5es wave directional buoy data, when previously was made with Figueira da Foz \n\nbuoy data. This is possible because, according with Coli [2003], there is homogeneity of wave climate on \n\nthe northern coast of Portugal. \n\n Therefore, between 1984 and 1996, were searched events of high wave climate. Of the several \n\nfound, will be studied the month of December of 1985 as well as the period between 1 and 15 of January \n\nof 1996. \n\n In order to separate the high (tidal signal) and low frequencies signals of the tidal gauge data, \n\nwas used a filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.0000093 Hz (30 h). Therefore, in the low frequency signal \n\nare included the meteorological events, mainly the atmospheric pressure variation, as well as the coastal \n\nwaves effects. Thus, taking into account the goal of this work (study the influence of coastal waves in the \n\ninlet hydrodynamics), in order to represent only the effect of the waves in the low frequency signal, was \n\nremored the influence of atmospheric pressure in the SSE through the inverted barometer effect, given by: \n\na\n\na\np\n\ng\n\np\n???????\n\n?\n??? 993.0?\n?\n\n?  \n\nwhere ?? is the water level variation, ?  is the water density, g  is the acceleration of gravity and ap? is \n\nthe atmospheric pressure variation, given by Pmeasured \u2013 1013.25 hPa. The value of 1013.25 hPa \n\ncorresponds to the normal atmospheric pressure at mean sea level. \n\n The atmospheric pressure data used in this work for the Aveiro coast are available in the website \n\nof NOAA [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html], corresponding to \n\nreanalysis data with a temporal resolution of 6 hours. In order to put in concordance the atmospheric \n\npressure and tidal gauge data, an interpolation of the atmospheric pressure data was made, creating a \n\nnew serie with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. \n\n With this procedure is quantified the effect of the coastal waves in the SSE, through the analysis \n\nof field data, since a direct comparison between Hs data and the low frequency signal containing only the \n\neffect of the waves will be performed. \n\n 3.5. Establishment of Scenarios  \n\n After it has been demonstrated that the model simulates accurately the Ria de Aveiro \n\nhydrodynamics, will be defined the scenarios to simulate, in order to understand the influence of the \n\nwaves in the lagoon hydrodynamics. \n\n The SWAN model runs considering the wave and wind fields as driving forces, more specifically \n\nthe significant wave height, period and direction of the waves and the velocity and direction of the wind. \n\nThese inputs are defined and considered as constant for all the simulation period. As schematized in \n\nFigure 14, for each tidal range (Spring, Typical and Neap tide), it was simulated the normal and the storm \n\nwave action in the Portuguese coast, and a case with the absence of waves. The case with the absence of \n\nwaves, therefore considering only the tidal forcing, is defined as scenario 0, constituting the reference \n\nscenario. \n\n(14) \n\n\n\nNumerical Models and Methodology  25 \n \n\n The normal and storm scenarios were defined taking into account the characterization of waves \n\nand wind presented in section 2.3. Thus, the normal regime has a typical WNW to NNW swell, with Hs \n\nbetween 2 and 2.5 meters and periods between 9 and 11 seconds, and moderate wind Northerly. In the \n\nstorm events, the Hs may reach 8 meters, and the waves usually come from SW with a period of 12 \n\nseconds. In these events, the wind is stronger and has a provenience from SE.  \n\n Therefore, the normal regime named scenario 1 is characterized by: \n\n? Significant wave height (Hs) = 2 meters \n\n? Wave period  = 9 seconds \n\n? Wave direction  = NW \n\n? Wind speed = 4 ms-1 \n\n? Wind direction  = NW \n\n \n\nFor storm regime named scenario 2 it was considered: \n\n \n\n? Significant wave height (Hs) = 8 meters \n\n? Wave period  = 12 seconds  \n\n? Wave direction  = SW \n\n? Wind speed = 16 ms-1 \n\n? Wind direction  = SE \n\n \n\n The duration of the simulations is 8 days, and the spring, typical and neap tide were identified \n\nthrough the analyses of the tide at the inlet of the Ria de Aveiro during the year 2011. The event of \n\nmaximum tidal amplitude (spring tide) was in March 20th 2011, the minimum amplitude (neap tides) in July \n\n24th 2011 and intermediate tidal range in November 12th 2011. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nNumerical Models and Methodology  26 \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14.

Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  \n\n 4.1. Analyses of Field Data of SSE, Hs and Atmospheric pressure \n\n As mentioned in the methodology of the analyses of field data of SSE, Hs and Atmospheric \n\npressure (section 3.4), the aim of this subsection is relate the Hs with over-elevations measured of the \n\nBarra tidal gauge and induced by coastal waves. Then, the SSE variations induced by atmospheric \n\npressure were removed from the low frequency signal of SSE, in order to represent only the influence of \n\nwaves in this signal. \n\n Therefore, the atmospheric pressure data from December of 1985 (upper panel) and between 1 \n\nand 15 of January of 1996 (lower panel) is represented in Figure 15.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15. Atmospheric pressure data between 1/12/1985 and 31/12/1985 (upper panel) and \n\nbetween 1/1/1996 and 15/1/1996 (lower panel).  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  28 \n \n\n The atmospheric pressure has an important effect in SSE, wherein an increase of atmospheric \n\npressure causes a compression in the water column leading to under-elevation in SSE. On the other hand, \n\na decrease of atmospheric pressure causes an expansion of water column leading to over-elevation of \n\nSSE. Thus, a 1 mbar atmospheric pressure change corresponds to a linear response of the sea level of \n\nabout 1 cm.  \n\n Therefore, in the upper panel of Figures 16 and 17 are illustrated the time series of the tidal signal \n\n(red line) and of the low frequency signal (blue line), which might be originated by meteorological action or \n\n'wave set-up', collected from the Barra tidal gauge, for the periods in study.  \n\n The values of atmospheric pressure represented in Figure 15 were converted to values of low \n\nfrequency water level through the expression of inverted barometer effect, constituting the red line of the \n\nmiddle panel of Figures 16 and 17. The blue line corresponds to the low frequency signal, also \n\nrepresented in the upper panel.  \n\n The analysis of the middle panel shows that the atmospheric pressure is related with the low \n\nfrequency signal, because some over or under-elevations are mainly caused by the atmospheric pressure \n\nvariation. However, there are some periods in the times series that the low frequency signal is not related \n\nwith the atmospheric pressure, therefore, in the lower panel is represented the low frequency signal \n\nwithout the atmospheric pressure contribution. Thus, only the influence of coastal waves is represented. \n\n Analysing the figures is observed that the tidal forcing is the most important forcing in the Ria de \n\nAveiro, and the waves have a visible effect on SSE. In fact, some over-elevations observed in the figures \n\nare caused by the coastal waves. Some of these events are represented with a black bar in the figures. \n\nWhen Hs increases up to 4 meters, the mean sea level caused by wave set-up increases to a maximum of \n\napproximately 0.21 m. When the Hs decrease, the signal also tends to decrease. Indeed, only the waves \n\nhigher than 4 meters have a considerable effect in SSE. The waves with a Hs lower than this value, has a \n\nmaximum of over-elevation of 7 cm. \n\nIn most cases, the estimation of wave set-up at inlets is only based on observations. Numerical \n\nmodels, on the other hand, provide an approach to study the importance of simulating waves effect or \n\nother external forces (e.g., winds) upon the hydrodynamic behaviour. In addition, hydrodynamic model \n\napplications are useful in understanding the main physical processes [Malhadas et al., 2009]. \n\n Thus, these initial results through field data analyses could provide a starting point to understand, \n\nthrough the use of numerical modelling, the real effect of waves on the hydrodynamics of the Ria de \n\nAveiro inlet.  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  29 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 16.

Modelling Results \n\n 4.2.1. Sea Surface Elevation \n\n Considering the scenarios defined in section 3.5, the results of the numerical simulations \n\nperformed are present in this subsection. Additionally, the variations in sea surface elevation induced by \n\nthe wave action are evaluated. First, the analysis of the time series of SSE at station 1 is performed, for \n\neach tidal range. The horizontal fields of the differences of SSE between scenarios 0 and 1 and between \n\nscenarios 1 and 2 for each tidal range are also shown in this subchapter. \n\n 4.2.1.1. Spring Tide \n\n The time series for the three scenarios aforementioned for spring tide condition for station 1 \n\n(Figure 8) are illustrated in Figure 18, as well as the differences between all the scenarios.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 18. Comparison between normal and storm regimes as well as the reference scenario, for \n\nspring tide condition (upper panel). The vertical lines correspond to instants chosen to illustrate \n\nhorizontal sea surface elevation fields. In the lower panel is represented the differences between \n\nall the scenarios.  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  32 \n \n\n The analysis of the SSE time series reveals that the normal wave climate (scenario 1) has no \n\ninfluence in the sea surface elevation, because there is an almost complete overlap of the lines of the \n\nscenario 1 and scenario 0. For the storm regime scenario (scenario 2) is found a clear over-elevation of \n\nthe sea surface (wave set-up), and consequently the high and low tides have higher elevations. The \n\ndifferences between the numerical results are higher in low tide when compared with high tide (visible in \n\nthe low panel of the figure). In the station analysed, the difference between scenarios 1 and 2 in the high \n\ntide is 14.5 cm, while in the low tide is about 25 cm. As mentioned before, the differences between the \n\nscenarios 0 and 1 are not substantial, however there is a slight over-elevation in scenario 1 not visible in \n\nthe figure. In high tide, those differences are 1.3 cm, while in low tide are 1.2 cm. The analysis of the low \n\npanel of time series help to clarify that the differences between scenarios 0 and 1 (red line) are negligible. \n\nThe highest difference between these scenarios is 3.6 cm. The figure also shows that the differences \n\nbetween blue and green lines corresponding to the differences between scenario 2 and 0, and between 2 \n\nand 1, respectively, never exceed 2.1 cm, therefore, for this station, only the storm waves (scenario 2) \n\ncauses significant changes in SSE. In order to investigate if these differences are not significant for all the \n\ninlet area, the horizontal fields of the differences between SSE determined for scenarios 0 and 1 are \n\nperformed and are presented in Figure 19. It is important to note that the vertical lines and correspondent \n\nletters, represented in Figure 18, correspond to instants chosen to illustrate the horizontal sea surface \n\nelevation fields. In order to analyse the time evolution of the spatial distribution of the SSE differences, the \n\nimages A, B, C and D of Figure 19 corresponds to high tide, ebb condition, low tide and flood condition, \n\nrespectively. Positive values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 1 relatively to scenario 0.  \n\n The analysis of Figure 19 reveals that the differences between the scenarios 0 and 1 never \n\nexceed the 3 cm, being close to 0 for most of the area, therefore there are negligible. Thus, it is assumed \n\nthat the SSE in scenarios 0 and 1 are equal. Taking this into account and to better visualize the effects of \n\nthe wave characteristics, horizontal fields of the differences between scenarios 1 and 2 are performed and \n\nare presented in Figure 20. Positive values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 2 relatively to \n\nscenario 1. \n\n The patterns found in the illustration of the SSE time series (Figure 18) are also perceptible in the \n\nhorizontal fields of SSE differences between scenarios 1 and 2 (Figure 20), verifying an over-elevation in \n\nscenario 2. Generally, the Barra beach (south to the inlet) is the most affected area by the coastal waves. \n\nIn contrast, the Meia Laranja beach is the local where the wave set-up is smaller, because it is a sheltered \n\nzone. \n\n  Analysing the time evolution it is observed that at high tide (Figure 20 A) the differences between \n\nthe scenarios are minimal, approximately 15 cm in whole inlet area. However, between the jetties there \n\nare areas where the differences are 17 cm. On the other hand, in the Meia Laranja beach the wave set-up \n\nis minimal (12 cm). In ebb condition (Figure 20 B), the differences increase to values around 19 cm in \n\nmost of the inlet area. Close to the North jetty, the difference between the scenarios are lower (12 cm), \n\nwhile near to the South jetty, the difference is about 22 cm. In the low tide (image C), the differences \n\nreache a maximum of 21 cm in all the inlet area. In the flood condition (image D), the difference between \n\nthe scenarios decrease to values about 13 cm. \n\n  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  33 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 1\n9\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\n\nf \nse\n\na\n s\n\nu\nrf\n\na\nce\n\n e\nle\n\nva\ntio\n\nn\n b\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n s\n\nce\nn\n\na\nri\n\no\ns \n\n0\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 1\n f\n\no\nr \n\nsp\nri\nn\n\ng\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\niti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nin\n\n m\ne\n\nte\nrs\n\n. \nT\n\nh\ne\n\n l\ne\n\ntt\ne\n\nrs\n c\n\no\nrr\n\ne\nsp\n\no\nn\n\nd\n \n\nto\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n in\nst\n\na\nn\n\nts\n c\n\nh\no\n\nse\nn\n t\n\no\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\nu\n\nte\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n h\no\n\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns,\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nte\nd\n\n in\n F\n\nig\nu\n\nre\n 1\n\n8\n. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  34 \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n0\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\n\nf \nse\n\na\n s\n\nu\nrf\n\na\nce\n\n e\nle\n\nva\ntio\n\nn\n b\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n s\n\nce\nn\n\na\nri\n\no\ns \n\n1\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 2\n f\n\no\nr \n\nsp\nri\nn\n\ng\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\niti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nin\n\n m\ne\n\nte\nrs\n\n. \nT\n\nh\ne\n\n l\ne\n\ntt\ne\n\nrs\n c\n\no\nrr\n\ne\nsp\n\no\nn\n\nd\n \n\nto\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n in\nst\n\na\nn\n\nts\n c\n\nh\no\n\nse\nn\n t\n\no\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\nu\n\nte\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n h\no\n\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns,\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nte\nd\n\n in\n F\n\nig\nu\n\nre\n 1\n\n8\n. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  35 \n \n\n 4.2.1.2. Intermediate Tide \n\n The time series for the three scenarios mentioned before for the intermediate tidal condition are \n\nillustrated in Figure 21 for station 1 (upper panel). In order to better visualize the differences between the \n\nscenarios, the time series of the differences between all of them are illustrated in the lower panel. \n\n Similarly to the spring tide condition, the normal wave climate (scenario 1) has no influence in the \n\nsea surface elevation while the storm regime scenario (scenario 2) shows a clear over-elevation of the sea \n\nsurface elevation (wave set-up). The SSE differences are, once again, higher in low tide. In the station \n\nanalysed, the difference between the scenarios 1 and 2 in high tide is about 13 cm, while in low tide is \n\napproximately 19 cm. As in the previous tidal condition, the differences between the scenario 0 and 1 are \n\nnegligible, however there is a slight over-elevation in scenario 1. In the high tide, those differences are 1.8 \n\ncm, while in the low tide are 0.6 cm. These values are clearly visible in the low panel of the Figure 21. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 21. Comparison between normal and storm regimes as well as the reference scenario, \n\nfor intermediate tide condition (upper panel). The vertical lines correspond to instants chosen to \n\nillustrate horizontal sea surface elevation fields. In the lower panel is represented the differences \n\nbetween all the scenarios. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  36 \n \n\n The lower panel of Figure 21 lightens that the major differences are verified in scenario 2, \n\nbecause, as in spring tide condition, the differences between scenario 1 and 0 (red line) are close to 0, \n\nreaching a maximum of 3.2 cm. The blue and green lines corresponding to the differences between \n\nscenario 2 and 0, and between 2 and 1, respectively, reinforce the idea that there are no major differences \n\nbetween scenarios 0 and 1 (major differences between theses lines are 2.9 cm). Thus, it is possible to say \n\nthat, for station 1, only the storm waves have influence in Sea Surface Elevation. In order to demonstrate \n\nthat the differences between 0 and 1 are negligible in the entire inlet area, the horizontal fields of the \n\ndifferences between SSE for scenarios 0 and 1 are performed and are presented in Figure 22. Positive \n\nvalues mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 1 relatively to scenario 0. As before, the vertical \n\nlines and correspondent letters, represented in Figure 21, correspond to instants chosen to illustrate \n\nhorizontal sea surface elevation fields. Similarly to the Spring tide condition, the differences in SSE \n\nbetween scenarios 0 and 1 never exceeds 3 cm in the entire inlet region, showing that the differences \n\nbetween scenarios 0 and 1 are negligible. Having this knowledge as a starting point, the horizontal \n\nfields of the SSE differences between scenarios 1 and 2 were performed and are presented in Figure 23. \n\nPositive values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 2 relatively to scenario 1. \n\n As referred in the analyses of time series (Figure 21), the wave set-up in the scenario 2 relatively \n\nto scenario 1 in the high tide (Figure 23 A) is about 13 cm. The difference between scenario 1 and 2 is \n\nconstant in the entire inlet zone. In the ebb condition (image B), the patterns are similar to those obtained \n\nin the high tide, however the differences increase to values around 15 cm, reaching a maximum in the \n\nimage C, corresponding to low tide condition. In this case, the differences between the scenarios are \n\nabout 18 cm in most of the inlet area.  However there are some places where the differences are higher, \n\nfor example, between the jetties (location of the station previously analysed), with values close to 20 cm. \n\nIn the flood condition, the wave set-up decrease again to values of about 14 cm, nevertheless in the \n\nregion close to the North jetty the differences are 16 cm.  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  37 \n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n2\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\n\nf \nse\n\na\n s\n\nu\nrf\n\na\nce\n\n e\nle\n\nva\ntio\n\nn\n b\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n s\n\nce\nn\n\na\nri\n\no\ns \n\n0\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 1\n f\n\no\nr \n\nin\nte\n\nrm\ne\n\nd\nia\n\nte\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\n\niti\no\n\nn\n, \n\nin\n m\n\ne\nte\n\nrs\n. \n\nT\nh\n\ne\n l\ne\n\ntt\ne\n\nrs\n \n\nco\nrr\n\ne\nsp\n\no\nn\n\nd\n t\n\no\n t\nh\n\ne\n in\n\nst\na\n\nn\nts\n\n c\nh\n\no\nse\n\nn\n t\n\no\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\nu\n\nte\n t\n\nh\ne\n h\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns,\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nte\nd\n in\n\n F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n1\n\n. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  38 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n3\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\n\nf \nse\n\na\n s\n\nu\nrf\n\na\nce\n\n e\nle\n\nva\ntio\n\nn\n b\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n s\n\nce\nn\n\na\nri\n\no\ns \n\n1\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 2\n f\n\no\nr \n\nin\nte\n\nrm\ne\n\nd\nia\n\nte\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\n\niti\no\n\nn\n, \n\nin\n m\n\ne\nte\n\nrs\n. \n\nT\nh\n\ne\n l\ne\n\ntt\ne\n\nrs\n \n\nco\nrr\n\ne\nsp\n\no\nn\n\nd\n t\n\no\n t\nh\n\ne\n in\n\nst\na\n\nn\nts\n\n c\nh\n\no\nse\n\nn\n t\n\no\n c\n\no\nm\n\np\nu\n\nte\n t\n\nh\ne\n h\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns,\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nte\nd\n in\n\n F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n1\n\n. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  39 \n \n\n 4.2.1.3. Neap Tide \n\n The time series of SSE for the three scenarios under study for neap tide for station 1 is illustrated \n\nin Figure 24. Additionally, in order to get a better observation of the differences between the scenarios, the \n\ntime series of the differences between all of them are illustrated in the lower panel. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n As previously observed for the spring and intermediate tide conditions, the normal wave climate \n\n(scenario 1) has no influence in the sea surface elevation at the inlet and the storm regime scenario \n\n(scenario 2) shows a clear wave set-up. The difference between the scenarios 1 and 2 (visible in lower \n\npanel) in the high tide is 14.3 cm, while in the low tide is approximately 21.4 cm. As in the previous tidal \n\nregimes, the differences between the scenario 0 and 1 are negligible. In the high tide, those differences \n\nare 1 cm, while in the low tide are 0.65 cm. The lower panel of Figure 24 reinforces the idea that the \n\nFigure 24. Comparison between normal and storm regimes as well as the reference scenario, \n\nfor neap tide condition (upper panel). The vertical lines correspond to instants chosen to \n\nillustrate horizontal sea surface elevation fields. In the lower panel is represented the \n\ndifferences between all the scenarios. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  40 \n \n\nscenario 1 has no significant influence in SSE at the inlet, because the differences between scenarios 2 \n\nand 0 (blue line) are identical to the differences between scenarios 2 and 1 (green line). As expected, the \n\ndifferences between scenario 1 and 0 are close to 0, reaching a maximum of 1.6 cm. The analysis of \n\nFigure 24 shows, as in previous tidal conditions, that only the scenario 2 cause important changes in SSE. \n\nThe influence of scenario 1 in the entire inlet area will be analysed, in more detail in Figure 25, that \n\nrepresents the horizontal fields of the differences of SSE between scenarios 0 and 1. Positive values \n\nmean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 1 relatively to scenario 0.  \n\n As expected, the scenario 1 has no significant influence in SSE, because the difference between \n\nthe scenarios never exceed 2 cm, being close to 0 in the majority of the instants studied.  Taking this into \n\naccount, the horizontal fields of the differences between scenarios 1 and 2 were computed and are \n\npresented in Figure 26. Positive values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 2 relatively to \n\nscenario 1.  \n\n In high tide (image A), the SSE differences between the scenarios are minimal, revealing a wave \n\nset-up in scenario 2 of 13 cm relatively to scenario 1. In this case, the differences are higher in the \n\nNorthern zone of the inlet, reaching a value of about 18.6 cm. In ebb condition (image B), the differences \n\nbetween the scenarios are approximately 18 cm in the inlet entrance, increasing gradually along the inlet \n\nchannel, reaching values of 19.5 cm. As mentioned before, the maximum values are found in low tide \n\n(image C), where the differences are about 22 cm. In flood condition, the wave set-up decreases, \n\npresenting values of 14 cm for all the inlet area. \n\nFrom the analysis performed for each tidal condition, was obtained the general pattern of the \n\nvariations of SSE induced by the coastal waves. The results at the inlet reveal that the normal wave \n\nclimate (scenario 1) has no influence in the sea surface elevation. For the storm regime scenario (scenario \n\n2) was found a clear over-elevation of the sea surface (wave set-up). These results are consistent with the \n\nfindings of Malhadas et al. [2009] for the \u00d3bidos lagoon that concluded that there is a correlation between \n\nthe wave height and the sea-level elevation only during high wave activity periods, when a significant \n\nwave set-up on lagoon sea level is observed. \n\n The waves effect observed in the results obtained for the numerical model simulations are in \n\nagreement with the effect of waves found in the analysis of field data (section 4.1). The field data analysis \n\nshows a maximum of set-up induced by the waves of approximately 21 cm for a wave with Hs of 8 meters. \n\nThe model results evidence results of the same order of magnitude, however in same instants, the over-\n\nelevation can reach values slightly higher than 25 cm. \n\n The wave set-up found at the inlet in all the numerical results may be explained by the water \n\ngathering in the inlet zone caused by the constant wave propagation and consequently breaking inside the \n\nRia de Aveiro inlet. The differences are higher during ebbing and consequently in the low tide, because in \n\nthis case the waves propagation and tidal currents have opposing directions. In this circumstance there is \n\na wave\u2019s compression, with a decrease in their wavelength and an increase in their amplitude. Thus, in the \n\nnormal regime the tide acts almost as a single forcing agent, while in the storm regime scenario the \n\nconstant wave propagation in the opposite direction of the tidal currents causes higher water retention in \n\nthe inlet. \n\n All the study area is exposed to the wave set-up, however the most affected zone is the Barra \n\nbeach. This may be explained by the Southwestard direction of the storm waves, causing water retention \n\nbetween the South jetty and the beach, producing a constant wave set-up in that zone. Contrarily, the \n\nMeia Laranja beach located in a sheltered zone is characterized by a lower set-up. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  41 \n \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n5\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\n\nf \nse\n\na\n s\n\nu\nrf\n\na\nce\n\n e\nle\n\nva\ntio\n\nn\n b\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n s\n\nce\nn\n\na\nri\no\ns \n\n0\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 1\n f\n\no\nr \n\nn\ne\n\na\np\n\n t\nid\n\ne\n c\n\no\nn\n\nd\niti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nin\n\n m\ne\n\nte\nrs\n\n. \nT\n\nh\ne\n\n le\ntt\n\ne\nrs\n\n c\no\n\nrr\ne\n\nsp\no\nn\nd\n\n t\no\n\n t\nh\n\ne\n \n\nin\nst\n\na\nn\n\nts\n c\n\nh\no\n\nse\nn\n\n t\no\n\n c\no\n\nm\np\n\nu\nte\n\n t\nh\ne\n\n h\no\n\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns,\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\nte\n\nd\n in\n\n F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n4\n\n. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  42 \n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n6\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\n\nf \nse\n\na\n s\n\nu\nrf\n\na\nce\n\n e\nle\n\nva\ntio\n\nn\n b\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n s\n\nce\nn\n\na\nri\no\ns \n\n1\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 2\n f\n\no\nr \n\nn\ne\n\na\np\n\n t\nid\n\ne\n c\n\no\nn\n\nd\niti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nin\n\n m\ne\n\nte\nrs\n\n. \nT\n\nh\ne\n\n le\ntt\n\ne\nrs\n\n c\no\n\nrr\ne\n\nsp\no\nn\nd\n\n t\no\n\n t\nh\n\ne\n \n\nin\nst\n\na\nn\n\nts\n c\n\nh\no\n\nse\nn\n\n t\no\n\n c\no\n\nm\np\n\nu\nte\n\n t\nh\ne\n\n h\no\n\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns,\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\nte\n\nd\n in\n\n F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n4\n\n. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  43 \n \n\n These results in SSE may have a considerable impact in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. With the \n\nknowledge that the higher elevation induced by a storm surge registered in Ria de Aveiro was 1 meter, \n\nthese values of wave set-up corresponds to approximately 20% of this value. Supposing that these wave \n\nset-up propagates into the lagoon, the margins of Ria de Aveiro may inundate. If the high wave climate \n\ncoincides with a condition of spring tide, heavy rainfall and with the occurrence of a storm surge, the \n\neffects can be even higher. \n\n It was also found that the effect of coastal waves at the Ria de Aveiro inlet is independent of tidal \n\nrange, as there are no differences in the over-elevations determined for each tidal condition under study. \n\n  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  44 \n \n\n 4.2.2. Current Velocity \n\n In this section, the effect of the waves in the current velocity at Ria de Aveiro inlet is evaluated. \n\nFirstly, the velocities in the three scenarios are compared, through the representation of the horizontal \n\nfields in the same instants chosen to illustrate the horizontal SSE fields. Posteriorly, the horizontal fields of \n\nthe differences between scenarios 1 and 2 are illustrated. All these analyses are performed for each tidal \n\ncondition. \n\n 4.2.2.1. Spring Tide \n\n The horizontal fields of the velocity intensity for the three scenarios, for the instants in study, are \n\nshown in Figure 27. To recall, the images A, B, C and D are illustrative of high tide, ebb condition, low tide \n\nand flood condition, respectively. \n\n Starting with the comparison between scenario 0 (tide only) and scenario 1 (tide + normal wave \n\nclimate), it was found that, in general, the waves considered in scenario 1 have no significant influence in \n\nthe current velocity, due to the similarity between the patterns (in the inlet area) in scenario 0 and 1. The \n\nnear shore zone is excluded of the analysis, because the goal of this study is focused in the inlet area. \n\nThe other reason is that due to the waves breaking in the beaches, the velocity shows changes with \n\nchaotic patterns. \n\n In images A of Figure 27, the current velocity has small values in the axis of the channel because \n\nthis instant corresponds to a high tide period. The patterns and the order of magnitude of velocity in \n\nscenarios 0 and 1 are similar, however for high wave activity (scenario 2) a slight increase of the current \n\nvelocity, reaching 1.3 ms-1 in the deeper areas of the inlet, is observed. \n\n As expected, the current velocity in ebb condition (images B) is highest, reaching a value of 2.5 \n\nms-1. At the inlet area, the patterns and the order of magnitude of the current velocity are similar in \n\nscenarios 0 and 1. In scenario 0, the strong ebb current reaches the offshore zone, with velocities \n\nbetween 1.5 and 2 ms-1. An identical pattern is observed in scenario 1, nevertheless with lower intensity, \n\nbecause the tide and waves act as opposite forces, minimizing the current velocity. In scenario 2, the \n\nwaves coming from SW \u2018push\u2019 the ebb current to North, increasing its magnitude, to values between 2 and \n\n2.5 ms-1. Into the inlet, the velocity has a slight increase in scenario 2 when compared with scenario 1. \n\n In low tide (images C), the current velocity is smaller when compared with ebb condition. The \n\ncurrent patterns between scenario 0 and 1 are similar, with velocities of about 0.8 ms-1 in the axis of the \n\nchannel. In the scenario 2, the patterns remain identical, with a slight increase of the velocity.  \n\nIn the flood condition (images D), the comparison of current velocity between scenarios 0 and 1 in \n\nthe interior of the inlet, show that the waves of scenario 1 have no influence in the current velocity. Thus, \n\nin scenarios 0 and 1, the velocity reaches maximum values of 1.8 ms-1 in the deeper areas of the inlet. In \n\nscenario 2, the velocity patterns are similar, however there is an increase of velocity, reaching 2.0 ms-1. In \n\nthis scenario, it are observed high velocities for all channel width, consequently the velocities in the inlet \n\nmargins are higher when compared to those found for the scenarios 0 and 1. \n\n From the analysis of Figure 27 it can be verified that in scenario 1 the tidal currents have more \n\ninfluence than the currents induced by waves. Nevertheless, in scenario 2 the presence of a combined \n\neffect of tidal currents and waves is observed. Then, the horizontal fields of the differences of current \n\nvelocities between scenarios 1 and 2 are represented in Figure 28. Positive values represent higher \n\nvelocities in the scenario 2, while negative values denote that the velocity is higher in the scenario 1.  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  45 \n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n7\n\n. \nR\n\ne\np\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nta\n\ntio\nn\n\n o\nf \n\nth\ne\n\n v\ne\n\nlo\nci\n\nty\n i\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n i\n\nn\n s\n\np\nri\nn\n\ng\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\n\niti\no\n\nn\n f\n\no\nr \n\nth\ne\n\n t\nh\n\nre\ne\n\n s\nce\n\nn\na\n\nri\no\ns,\n\n i\nn\n\n m\n/s\n\n. \nT\n\nh\ne\n\n l\ne\n\ntt\ne\n\nrs\n c\n\no\nrr\n\ne\nsp\n\no\nn\nd\n\n t\no\n\n t\nh\n\ne\n i\n\nn\nst\n\na\nn\n\nts\n c\n\nh\no\nse\n\nn\n \n\n(p\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nte\nd\n\n in\n F\n\nig\nu\n\nre\n 1\n\n8\n) \n\nto\n r\n\ne\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n h\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  46 \n \n\n Figure 28 A represents the difference between the scenarios 1 and 2 in the high tide. In this \n\ncondition, the storm waves coming from SW increases the current velocity close to the South jetty and in \n\nthe axis of the channel (deeper areas), where the velocity differences reaches 0.35 ms-1. Out of the central \n\nregion of the inlet, the velocities are higher in the scenario 1, reaching a maximum difference of 0.33 ms-1, \n\nclose to the North jetty. \n\n The horizontal field of the differences of current velocity at ebb condition represented in Figure 28 \n\nB, indicates that the currents induced by waves have lower importance when compared with the tidal \n\ncurrents, which in the ebb condition are very strong. Thus, in the offshore zone exists an area Northern of \n\nthe inlet where the velocity is higher in scenario 2 (difference of 0.6 ms-1), while Southern of the inlet the \n\nvelocity is higher in scenario 1. This is justified by the ebb current that comes out the inlet. In scenario 1, \n\nthe ebb current has the same orientation of the jetties, while in scenario 2 the waves coming from SW, \n\n\u2018push\u2019 the ebb current to North. Inside the inlet, the differences between the scenarios are constant, \n\nrevealing an increase of velocity of 0.1 ms-1, for scenario 2, in the entire study area. The exception is close \n\nto Meia Laranja beach, where the velocity is higher in scenario 1. \n\n The image C (low tide) illustrates the same velocity patterns, inside the inlet, when compared to \n\nthe ebb condition (image B). With exception to the area close to Meia Laranja beach, the velocity in \n\nscenario 2 is higher comparing with scenario 1. The difference value is uniform for all the inlet area (0.1 \n\nms-1).  \n\n In flood condition (image D), the differences are higher when compared to low tide. Close to the \n\nNorth jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 2, revealing differences of 0.39 ms-1. This may be explained \n\ndue to the combined effect of flood current with the SW storm waves that break in the North jetty, leading \n\nto an increase of the velocity in this area. In most of the central channel of the inlet, the velocity increases \n\nabout 0.15 ms-1 in scenario 2. On the other hand, in the region close to the South jetty, the velocity is \n\nhigher in the scenario 1, because the waves coming to NW breaks in the South jetty, increasing the \n\nvelocity in this zone. \n\n  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  47 \n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n8\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\n\nf \nth\n\ne\n c\n\nu\nrr\n\ne\nn\n\nt \nve\n\nlo\nci\n\nty\n b\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n s\n\nce\nn\na\n\nri\no\ns \n\n1\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 2\n i\n\nn\n s\n\np\nri\nn\n\ng\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\n\niti\no\nn\n\n, \nin\n\n m\n/s\n\n. \nT\n\nh\ne\n\n l\ne\n\ntt\ne\n\nrs\n c\n\no\nrr\n\ne\nsp\n\no\nn\n\nd\n t\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n i\nn\n\nst\na\n\nn\nts\n\n \n\nch\no\n\nse\nn\n\n (\np\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nte\n\nd\n in\n\n F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 1\n8\n\n) \nto\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n h\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  48 \n \n\n 4.2.2.2. Intermediate Tide \n\n The horizontal fields of the current velocity for the three scenarios are illustrated in Figure 29, for \n\nthe instants in study. The images A to D correspond to the high tide, ebb condition, low tide and flood \n\ncondition, respectively. \n\n In general, comparing the three scenarios, it is verified that the velocity patterns found in scenario \n\n0 (tide only) and in scenario 1 (tide + normal wave climate) are similar. Comparing the scenario 2 (tide + \n\nstorm wave climate) with the other scenarios in study, some changes in the velocity patterns are \n\nobserved, mainly in images B and D, corresponding to ebb and flood condition, respectively.  \n\n In high tide (images A), the difference between the three scenarios is negligible. Into the inlet \n\narea, in the central zone of the channel, the velocity is about 1.0 ms-1, reaching values of 1.3 ms-1 in some \n\nrestricted areas (deeper zones).  \n\n The image B shows, as in spring tide, a strong ebb current in the central channel, with velocities \n\nbetween 1.5 and 1.65 ms-1, reaching 1.9 ms-1 in the deepest area of the inlet. Although inside the inlet \n\nthere is a slight increase of the velocity in the scenario 2, what becomes evident is the ebb current being \n\n\u2018pushed\u2019 to North due the SW storm waves. This pattern was also observed in spring tide condition. \n\n In low tide (images C), the current velocity is lower than the verified in the ebb condition. In the \n\nscenarios 0 and 1, the velocity in the axis of the inlet ranges between 0.47 and 0.61 ms-1. The velocity \n\npatterns between these two scenarios are similar. The main difference is, due the NW waves, the tidal \n\ncurrent in scenario 1 is pushed Southward, incrementing the velocities close to the South jetty (maximum \n\nof 1.06 ms-1). The opposite pattern is observed in scenario 2, leading to high velocities near the North jetty \n\n(1.59 ms-1). Into the inlet area the velocity is higher in scenario 2 (about 0.1 ms-1).  \n\n In images D, corresponding to flood condition, the velocity pattern between scenarios 0 and 1 is \n\nsimilar. In most areas of the inlet, the velocity magnitude ranges between 1.01 and 1.21 ms-1, with \n\nexception of the deepest zone of the inlet, where the velocity is 1.44 ms-1. Comparing the scenario 2 with \n\nthe scenarios 0 and 1, the differences are clear.  \n\n Thus, in order to study the differences between scenario 1 and 2, and since there are no \n\nconsiderable differences between scenarios 0 and 1, the horizontal fields of the current velocity \n\ndifferences between scenarios 1 and 2 is computed and illustrated in Figure 30. As in the previous tidal \n\ncondition, positive values represent higher velocities in the scenario 2, while negative values denote that \n\nthe velocity is higher in the scenario 1. \n\n Figure 30 A shows small differences between scenarios 1 and 2, however in the upper region of \n\nthe inlet, the velocities are higher in scenario 1. The magnitude of the difference is 0.07 ms-1, reaching a \n\nmaximum of 0.28 ms-1 between the jetties. In the Southest area of the inlet, the scenario 2 presents higher \n\nvelocities (0.04 ms-1). \n\nIn ebb condition (Figure 30 B), the velocity in scenario 2 is higher in all the inlet area, with \n\ndifferences ranging between 0.02 and 0.08 ms-1. Close to the North jetty, the difference is about 0.45 ms-1, \n\nwhile in the South jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 1 (0.16 ms-1). This might be justified by the \n\ninflection of the ebb current forced by the orientation of the storm waves. \n\n  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  49 \n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n9\n\n. \nR\n\ne\np\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nta\n\ntio\nn\n\n o\nf \n\nth\ne\n\n v\ne\n\nlo\nci\n\nty\n i\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n i\n\nn\n i\n\nn\nte\n\nrm\ne\n\nd\nia\n\nte\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\n\niti\no\n\nn\n f\n\no\nr \n\nth\ne\n t\n\nh\nre\n\ne\n s\n\nce\nn\n\na\nri\no\ns\n, \n\nin\n m\n\n/s\n. \n\nT\nh\n\ne\n l\n\ne\ntt\n\ne\nrs\n\n c\no\n\nrr\ne\n\nsp\no\nn\n\nd\n t\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n i\nn\n\nst\na\n\nn\nts\n\n \n\nch\no\n\nse\nn\n\n (\np\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nte\n\nd\n in\n\n F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n1\n\n) \nto\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n h\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns.\n\n \n\n in\n F\n\nig\nu\n\nre\n 1\n\n8\n. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  50 \n \n\n As mentioned and explained in the analysis of Figure 29, in low tide, the direction of the waves in \n\nscenarios 1 and 2 are very relevant. In scenario 1 the tidal current is pushed Southward, incrementing the \n\nvelocities close to the South jetty, while in scenario 2 the opposite pattern is observed, leading to high \n\nvelocities near the North jetty. Consequently, it is observed in Figure 30 C that the velocity close to North \n\njetty is higher in scenario 2 (0.43 ms-1) while in the South jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 1 (0.47 \n\nms-1). In the remaining inlet region, the velocity is higher in the scenario 2, with differences ranging \n\nbetween 0.04 ms-1 and 1.1 ms-1. \n\n The differences between the scenarios in the flood condition (Figure 30 D) are considerable. In \n\nthe axis of the inlet channel, the velocity is higher in scenario 2 with a magnitude difference of 0.53 ms-1 \n\nclose to the South jetty, decreasing gradually into the inlet, achieving differences of about 0.18 ms-1 in its \n\nupstream zone. Close to the North jetty the velocity is higher in scenario 1, where the maximum \n\ndifferences reach 0.51 ms-1. \n\n  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  51 \n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 3\n0\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl \nfie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\nf \n\nth\ne\n\n c\nu\n\nrr\ne\n\nn\nt \n\nve\nlo\n\nci\nty\n\n b\ne\n\ntw\ne\n\ne\nn\n\n s\nce\n\nn\na\n\nri\no\ns \n\n1\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 2\n i\n\nn\n i\n\nn\nte\n\nrm\ne\n\nd\nia\n\nte\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\niti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nin\n\n m\n/s\n\n. \nT\n\nh\ne\n l\n\ne\ntt\ne\n\nrs\n c\n\no\nrr\n\ne\nsp\n\no\nn\n\nd\n t\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne\n \n\nin\nst\n\na\nn\n\nts\n c\n\nh\no\n\nse\nn\n\n (\np\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nte\n\nd\n in\n\n F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n1\n\n) \nto\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n h\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns.\n\n \n\n. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  52 \n \n\n 4.2.2.3. Neap Tide \n\n The horizontal fields of the velocity for the three scenarios in study are computed and illustrated \n\nin Figure 31, for high tide (A), ebb condition (B), low tide (C) and flood condition (D). \n\n The first analysis of the Figure indicates, as expected, that the current velocity in the neap tide is \n\nsignificantly lower when compared with spring and intermediate tidal conditions. It is important to note that \n\nthe scale adopted in Figure 31 is different of the one used in Figures 27 and 29. \n\n In Figure 31 A, is observed a slight increase of current velocity in scenario 1 when compared with \n\nscenario 0. However major differences are observed in scenario 2, in comparison with scenarios 0 and 1. \n\nIn the central axis of the channel, in scenario 1, the velocity range between 0.41 and 0.46 ms-1. In scenario \n\n2, the region where the velocity is higher is in the Northern area of the inlet: 0.85 ms-1, reaching a \n\nmaximum of 0.96 ms-1. In the central area, the velocity is close to 0 ms-1, while in the Southern area, the \n\nvelocity increases again to values around 0.62 ms-1. Thus, the differences between scenario 2 and the \n\nreference scenario (0) seem clear. \n\n In the ebb condition (images B), the patterns found in scenarios 0 and 1 are similar. In the central \n\nzone of the channel, the velocity range between 0.67 and 0.82 ms-1, decreasing between the jetties, with \n\nvalues of about 0.48 ms-1. In scenario 2, the current patterns are identical, however an increase of velocity \n\nis observed. In the axis of the channel, the velocity range between 0.72 and 0.84 ms-1, while between the \n\njetties the velocity is approximately 0.79 ms-1 close to the North jetty and 0.45 ms-1 near the South one. \n\n In the low tide (images C), the velocity patterns inside the inlet for the three scenarios are similar. \n\nThe velocities are lower when compared with the ebb condition, and are relatively constant in the central \n\nchannel of the inlet, with values of about 0.30 ms-1.  \n\n In the flood condition (images D), the velocity increases again. The velocity patterns between \n\nscenarios 0 and 1 are similar. However, in scenario 1, the velocity is higher when compared with reference \n\nscenario (scenario 0). In scenario 0, the velocity is about 0.55 ms-1 in the major part of the channel, \n\nreaching a maximum of 0.75 ms-1. In scenario 1, the velocity in the central channel range between 0.57 \n\nand 0.65 ms-1, reaching a maximum of 0.84 ms-1. Nevertheless, the highest differences are observed in \n\nscenario 2. The waves coming from SW \u2018push\u2019 the flood current to the Northern zone of the inlet, leading \n\nto a substantial velocity increase in this area, reaching a value of 1.034 ms-1. Consequently, the velocity in \n\nthe Southern area of the inlet is smaller (close to 0.1 ms-1) when compared with scenario 1. \n\n Based on these results, the horizontal fields of the current velocity differences between scenarios \n\n1 and 2 are represented in Figure 32. Positive values represent higher velocities in the scenario 2, while \n\nnegative values means that the velocity is higher in the scenario 1. \n\nAs mentioned in the analysis of Figure 31 A, corresponding to the high tide, the scenario 2 \n\nreveals a considerable increase of the velocity Northern of the inlet channel, a decrease in the centre and \n\nan increase in the Southern area of the inlet. As expected, this pattern is observed in the horizontal fields \n\nof the current velocity differences between scenarios 1 and 2. In the Northern area of the channel, the \n\nvelocity is higher in scenario 2 with values of 0.44 ms-1, reaching a maximum of 0.72 ms-1. In the central \n\narea, the velocity is higher in scenario 1 (maximum of 0.38 ms-1), while in the Southern area of the \n\nchannel, the velocity is higher in scenario 2, with a value of 0.41 ms-1. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  53 \n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 3\n1\n\n. \nR\n\ne\np\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nta\n\ntio\nn\n\n o\nf \n\nth\ne\n\n v\ne\n\nlo\nci\n\nty\n i\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n i\n\nn\n n\n\ne\na\n\np\n t\n\nid\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nd\n\niti\no\n\nn\n f\n\no\nr \n\nth\ne\n\n t\nh\n\nre\ne\n\n s\nce\n\nn\na\n\nri\no\n\ns,\n i\n\nn\n m\n\n/s\n. \n\nT\nh\n\ne\n l\n\ne\ntt\n\ne\nrs\n\n c\no\n\nrr\ne\n\nsp\no\n\nn\nd\n\n t\no\n\n t\nh\n\ne\n i\n\nn\nst\n\na\nn\n\nts\n c\n\nh\no\nse\n\nn\n \n\n(p\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nte\nd\n\n in\n F\n\nig\nu\n\nre\n 2\n\n4\n) \n\nto\n r\n\ne\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n h\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  54 \n \n\n In ebb condition (Figure 32 B), the velocity, in scenario 2, is higher in the entire inlet area, with \n\nexception to the zone close to South jetty. In more detail, close to the North jetty major differences are \n\nobserved (0.77 ms-1). Close to the South jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 1 (0.20 ms-1). In the central \n\nchannel of the inlet, the difference between the scenarios never exceeds 0.1 ms-1, with the exception of \n\nthe Southern zone, where the velocity difference can reach 0.21 ms-1. \n\n In Figure 32 C, corresponding to low tide, the difference between the scenarios inside the inlet is \n\nnot significant. More specifically, as in previous tidal conditions, the velocity in the North jetty is higher in \n\nscenario 2 (0.57 ms-1). On the other hand, in South jetty the velocity is higher in the normal wave climate \n\nscenario, with a difference of about 0.27 ms-1. In the central area of the channel, the differences range \n\nbetween 0.02 (higher in scenario 2) and -0.02 ms-1 (higher in scenario 1). Then, it was found that, inside \n\nthe inlet there are no important differences between the scenarios in this situation. \n\n As mentioned before, in the flood tide situation (Figure 32 D), in scenario 2, the waves coming \n\nfrom SW \u2018push\u2019 the flood current to the Northern region of the inlet, with a significant increase of the \n\nvelocity in this area (0.35 ms-1). On the other hand, in scenario 1, the flood current enters in the lagoon in \n\nthe central area, thus the velocity in this zone is higher in scenario 1 (maximum of 0.47 ms-1). Close to the \n\njetties, the velocity is higher in scenario 2. In the North jetty, the difference is about 0.35 ms-1, although in \n\nthe South one, the difference is 0.57 ms-1. Between the jetties, the velocity is higher in scenario 1, \n\nreaching a maximum of 0.39 ms-1. \n\nFrom the analysis performed for each tidal condition, can be discussed the general patterns of \n\nthe current velocity induced by the coastal waves. The pattern of the velocities difference between the \n\nscenarios is not as well defined as that found for the sea surface elevation. The regions with higher \n\ndifferences between the scenarios are offshore the inlet and near shore, Northward and Southward the \n\ninlet. This is justified considering that there are important differences in the current velocities in the \n\nbreaking zone (where they show a chaotic pattern), which are dependent on the characteristics of the \n\nwaves adopted for each scenario. \n\n From the analysis of the previous results it was found that the currents in the Ria de Aveiro inlet \n\nare mainly tidal currents, however the currents induced by storm waves must be taken into account. In \n\nreality, it was verified that the currents induced by the waves interacts with the tidal currents, modifying its \n\nmagnitude and direction. Therefore, the direction of the waves is an important factor, because it was \n\nobserved that the waves can cause changes in the main flow direction. \n\nIn general, it was observed that, in the majority of situations analysed, the high wave climate \n\n(scenario 2) increases the velocity inside the inlet. This may be explained considering that the wave set-up \n\ncaused by the storm waves (studied in subsection 5.2.1) creates a higher gradient pressure between the \n\noffshore sea level and the lagoon sea level, and consequently the velocity increases. \n\n Other important pattern found in the majority of situations studied is that the velocity, in scenario \n\n2, is higher close to the North jetty. On the other hand, in the South jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario \n\n1. This happens because the waves in scenario 1 are Southward, breaking in the South jetty, whereas the \n\nwaves coming from SW, in the high wave scenario breaks against the North jetty, increasing the velocity \n\nsurrounding this zone.  \n\nIn some shallow zones, for example in Meia Laranja beach, the velocity in some instants is higher \n\nfor scenario 1. In this case, due the low depth of these areas, the velocity will be lower in scenario 2, since \n\nthe increase in the total water column height is higher, and therefore by continuity the velocity will \n\ndecrease. \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  55 \n \n\n  \n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 3\n2\n\n. \nH\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns \n\no\nf \n\nd\niff\n\ne\nre\n\nn\nce\n\ns \no\n\nf \nth\n\ne\n c\n\nu\nrr\n\ne\nn\n\nt \nve\n\nlo\nci\n\nty\n b\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n s\n\nce\nn\n\na\nri\no\ns \n\n1\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n 2\n in\n\n n\ne\n\na\np\n\n t\nid\n\ne\n c\n\no\nn\n\nd\niti\n\no\nn\n\n, \nin\n\n m\n/s\n\n. \nT\n\nh\ne\n\n le\ntt\n\ne\nrs\n\n c\no\n\nrr\ne\ns\np\n\no\nn\n\nd\n t\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n in\nst\n\na\nn\n\nts\n \n\nch\no\n\nse\nn\n\n (\np\n\nre\nse\n\nn\nte\n\nd\n in\n\n F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 2\n4\n\n) \nto\n\n r\ne\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nt \nth\n\ne\n h\n\no\nri\nzo\n\nn\nta\n\nl f\nie\n\nld\ns.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nWave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  56 \n \n\n These results may have an important effect, for instance, in the sediment transport, because the \n\nchanges in the current velocity may modify the patterns in its transport. In fact, the scientific community \n\nhave it into regard. In Ria de Aveiro, the majority of the morphodynamics studies take into account the \n\ntidal forcing as well as the coastal waves. As example, Plecha et al. [2011], performed the evaluation of \n\nsingle waves effects on the morphologic evolution of a Ria de Aveiro lagoon inlet, concluding that the \n\nwave induced residual sediment fluxes in the cross sections upstream the lagoon mouth are smaller in \n\nmagnitude than at the inlet, restricting the influence of the waves to the lagoon mouth and adjacent \n\ncoastline.\n\n\n\nConclusions and Future Improvements  57 \n \n\n5. Conclusions and Future Improvements \n\n The main goal of this work was to study the influence of the wave regime on the hydrodynamics \n\nof Ria de Aveiro inlet through the analysis of field data and numerical modeling results. With this purpose, \n\nthe 2DH morphodynamic modeling system MORSYS2D has been used. This modeling system integrates, \n\nin this study, the hydrodynamic model ELCIRC and the wave model SWAN, that was successfully applied \n\nto research the integrated effect of tidal and wave effects.  \n\n The hydrodynamic model ELCIRC was previously implemented in the Ria de Aveiro by Picado \n\n[2008], in order to understand the consequences of the partial salt pans walls destruction on the entire Ria \n\nde Aveiro lagoon hydrodynamics. The bathymetry used by the author was successfully updated with a \n\nrecent bathymetry data set. Picado [2008] had also developed a horizontal grid which resolution was \n\ninsufficient for the present work, because the grid had insufficient resolution in the offshore zone. For that \n\nreason and taking into account the main aim of this work the existing grid was improved, refining the \n\noffshore and the inlet zone, where this work is focused. \n\n Several model runs were performed to calibrate the numerical model, by adjusting the bottom \n\nstress in order to reduce the differences between the available data and model results. According to the \n\nfinal results, the model was considered successfully calibrated for a very complex system as Ria de \n\nAveiro. The results of the calibration in the inlet should be considered excellent. In the upstream channels, \n\nthe agreement between the observations and model results is smaller when compared to the calibration \n\nresults in the inlet. These differences are due to several factors, such as very narrow lagoon channels that \n\nare not well resolved by the horizontal model grid, and some possible uncertainties in the field data, as \n\nwell as due to possible inaccuracies in the bathymetry. The temporal discrepancy between the data and \n\npredictions is also an important factor for the higher disagreement in the upper stations of the lagoon. \n\n Once calibrated the ELCIRC component, the 2DH morphodynamic modeling system MORSYS2D \n\nwas used to understand the effect of the coastal waves in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. Different \n\nscenarios were defined: scenario with the absence of waves and wind; normal wave climate scenario and \n\nhigh wave climate scenario. In order to achieve the main goal of this study, the sea surface elevation and \n\ncurrent velocity were analysed for all the scenarios in study.   \n\n The results found under the wave regime forcing show that for the low wave activity scenario \n\n(normal regime) the inlet hydrodynamics is mainly dominated by the tidal forcing. For the highest wave \n\nregime are found higher sea surface elevations at the inlet induced by the wave set-up when compared \n\nwith simulations performed only with tidal forcing or with the normal regime. In fact, the modelling results \n\nshow that the lagoon sea level remains above offshore sea level during storm wave periods. The wave \n\nset-up found at the inlet in all the numerical results may be explained by the gathering of water in the inlet \n\nzone caused by the constant wave propagation and consequently breaking inside the Ria de Aveiro inlet. \n\nThe differences are higher during ebbing and consequently in the low tide, because in this case the waves \n\npropagation and tidal currents have opposing directions. In this case there is a wave\u2019s compression, with a \n\ndecrease in their wavelength and an increase in their amplitude. \n\n The currents induced by the waves interact with the tidal currents, modifying its characteristics \n\nsuch as the magnitude and the direction of the predominant flow. In summary, due to wave set-up, the \n\nwaves cause a slight increase of the current velocity in the inlet area. \n\n Although the dominant forcing of the Ria de Aveiro inlet hydrodynamics is the tide, it may be \n\nconcluded that the sea level and current velocity fluctuations at the Ria de Aveiro inlet depend also on the \n\nwave regime. Consequently, the storm events induce important waves set-up that change the inlet \n\n\n\nConclusions and Future Improvements  58 \n \n\nhydrodynamics, requiring that the coupling between waves and tides should be considered to represent \n\naccurately the processes which depend on the inlet dynamics. \n\n As mentioned in introduction chapter, this is the first study that aims to research the influence of \n\nthe waves in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. For that reason, this work may constitute a starting point for \n\nfurther studies and improvements in the study of this subject. As example, it would be interesting to study \n\nhow the over-elevation at the inlet caused by the waves propagates into the lagoon. \n\n Dias and Mariano [2011] evaluated the hydrodynamic response of Ria de Aveiro to an extension \n\nby 200 meters of the north jetty, that is being presently implemented. Based on this study, it is of crucial \n\nimportance to include the combined effect of tide and waves on modelling simulations in order to \n\nunderstand the influence of this coastal work in the hydrodynamics of the Ria de Aveiro inlet. Another \n\nimportant issue to research in the future consists in performing a sensitivity analysis in order to understand \n\nwhich is the most important wave component (Hs, direction or period) that causes the wave set-up in the \n\nlagoon, as well as what will be there relevant threshold values. \n\n As referred in the introduction chapter (Section 1.1), the economic and environmental importance \n\nof tidal inlets has been growing worldwide. The Ria de Aveiro is an unmistakable example of this due to \n\nharbouring important commercial and fishing ports, and because many social and sportive activities are \n\nconcentrated in the inlet area. Thus, the improvement of the knowledge of the processes that occur in the \n\nzone is crucial to the development of the economic activities surrounding these areas, as well as to the \n\npeople who live around this region and enjoy its activities.  \n\n\n\nReferences  59 \n \n\n6.
