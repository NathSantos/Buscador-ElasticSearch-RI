This process is recognized as ocean acidification and can severely damage calcifying \n\norganisms. Since echinoderms have an endoskeleton composed of magnesium calcite, they are \n\npredicted to be a sensitive taxa affected by this acidic environment. Taking into account that some \n\nspecies of this filo have a faster regeneration capacity under low pH, analysis of the proteome \n\nrepresents a powerful tool to examine these physiological trait at a molecular level. Trying to \n\nstrengthen this work on ocean acidification effects, we studied Asterias rubens\u2019 behaviour by \n\nobserving their preference in choosing a leading arm when submitted to different regeneration time-\n\npoints (non-regeneration and regeneration after 1, 4, 9 and 14 days) and at two pH environments \n\n(control (CpH) \u2013 8.1 and low (LpH) \u2013 7.7). It was concluded that they do not have a preference leading \n\narm before ablation in both pH environments. Although, one day after ablation they drastically \n\ndecrease the use of the wounded arms, as expected, while the non-amputated arms did not suffer \n\nany changes. Furthermore, after nine days subjected to these conditions, it seems that sea stars \n\nrecovered completely the movement of the amputated arms. Asterosaponins search was also a vital \n\npart of this work, since they are known for having important functions in sea stars. We observed that \n\ntwo of the nine asterosaponins detected in the control pH were also detected in low pH samples, and \n\nthat their concentration decreased, suggesting that acidic pH may alter their biosynthesis. Proteins \n\nfrom both cell-free coelomic fluid (CFF) and radial nerve cord (RNC) were extracted, digested and \n\nfurther analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS. We were able to identify 298 proteins, being 81% of all proteins \n\nidentified differentially expressed. A surprising finding was the almost absence of stress proteins in \n\nan acidic pH environment.  \n\nIn this work, we propose a correlation between an acidic environment and asterosaponins\u2019 \n\nbiological effects. The decline in diversity and amount of these biomolecules can be caused by \n\nalready known decreases in respiratory rate and cholesterol absorption. Although, asterosaponins \n\nmight have positive effects in predation and reproduction. The detected increase in vitellogenin \n\nexpression seems to be associated with the amplified spawning event induced by the low levels of \n\nasterosaponins at acidic pH, thereby also enhancing reproduction. \n\n \n\nKeywords: ocean acidification, A. rubens, asterosaponins, behaviour, proteome \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nv \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nDesde o in\u00edcio da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o industrial (s\u00e9culo 18) que os n\u00edveis atmosf\u00e9ricos de di\u00f3xido de \n\ncarbono (CO2) t\u00eam aumentado a um ritmo nunca antes registado (de 280ppm para 380ppm, e \n\nespera-se que duplique no final do s\u00e9culo), essencialmente devido \u00e0 emiss\u00e3o de gases com efeito de \n\nestufa resultantes de atividades humanas. Como consequ\u00eancia, a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2 dissolvido nos \n\noceanos tamb\u00e9m aumenta, e por sua vez, tamb\u00e9m a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de i\u00f5es hidrog\u00e9nio e i\u00f5es \n\nbicarbonato, conduzindo a uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de pH e de i\u00f5es carbonato. Este conjunto de rea\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 \n\ndesignado por acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos, e pode danificar seriamente o funcionamento de \n\norganismos marinhos que de alguma forma utilizam o processo de biocalcifica\u00e7\u00e3o na sua estrutura \n\ncorporal. Os equinodermes possuem um endosqueleto composto por calcite de magn\u00e9sio, t\u00eam uma \n\nextraordin\u00e1ria capacidade de regenera\u00e7\u00e3o, mas tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o osmoconformadores. Isto significa que \n\no fluido cel\u00f3mico (CF) que preenche a cavidade corporal \u00e9 muito semelhante, a n\u00edvel de composi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ni\u00f3nica, ao ambiente externo a que est\u00e1 submetido. Embora tamb\u00e9m muito id\u00eantico, o pH do fluido \n\ncel\u00f3mico \u00e9 geralmente 0.11-0.58 unidades mais baixo que o pH do exterior, devido a taxas de difus\u00e3o \n\nde CO2 mais ou menos lentas, que podem aumentar ou reduzir a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de di\u00f3xido de carbono \n\nno CF, respetivamente. Por estas raz\u00f5es prev\u00ea-se que os equinodermes sejam um taxa sens\u00edvel a \n\nambientes \u00e1cidos. Apesar de se esperar que todas as esp\u00e9cies sejam afetadas de forma negativa, \u00e9 \n\ndo conhecimento cient\u00edfico que algumas esp\u00e9cies deste filo crescem e desenvolvem-se mais \n\ndepressa quando expostas a pH \u00e1cido, enquanto outras apresentam diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de metabolismo ou \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o da express\u00e3o proteica global. Considerando a diversidade incongruente de resultados \n\npublicados, e tendo a estrela-do-mar comum A. rubens como esp\u00e9cie-alvo, realiz\u00e1mos an\u00e1lises de \n\nexpress\u00e3o proteica para estudar estas observa\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas de uma perspetiva molecular. \n\nPor forma a ter um estudo mais completo sobre o efeito da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o nesta esp\u00e9cie, \n\nobserv\u00e1mos estrelas-do-mar sob diferentes tempos de regenera\u00e7\u00e3o (n\u00e3o-amputa\u00e7\u00e3o e amputa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nap\u00f3s 1 dia, 4, 9 e 14) submetidas a dois pHs (controlo (CpH) \u2013 8.1 e \u00e1cido (LpH) \u2013 7.7), com o \n\nprop\u00f3sito de determinar com que bra\u00e7o preferencialmente elas iniciavam a desloca\u00e7\u00e3o. Os bra\u00e7os \n\nescolhidos para amputa\u00e7\u00e3o foram os mais pr\u00f3ximos \u00e0 madreporita. As estrelas-do-mar n\u00e3o \n\napresentaram prefer\u00eancia no bra\u00e7o \u2018l\u00edder\u2019 antes de amputadas e sob CpH, o que n\u00e3o \u00e9 consistente \n\ncom resultados j\u00e1 publicados. No entanto, como esperado, os bra\u00e7os amputados apresentaram uma \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00famero de movimentos um dia ap\u00f3s a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o ser imposta, enquanto o n\u00famero \n\nde movimentos dos bra\u00e7os n\u00e3o-amputados permaneceu igual. Ap\u00f3s nove dias os movimentos dos \n\nbra\u00e7os amputados foram restabelecidos para os valores iniciais (sem amputa\u00e7\u00e3o), e por isso \n\nconsider\u00e1mos que as estrelas recuperaram o movimento normal dos bra\u00e7os. \u00c9 vantajoso para a \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\nestrela-do-mar que este movimento seja restabelecido o mais rapidamente poss\u00edvel, para que possa, \n\nentre outros, alimentar-se e/ou fugir de poss\u00edveis predadores. \n\nPara estudar os fatores moleculares que possam estar envolvidos em resposta a uma futura \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o do pH dos oceanos, foram recolhidos dois tipos de amostra: fluido cel\u00f3mico (dois pHs e \n\n15 dias p\u00f3s-amputa\u00e7\u00e3o), e nervo radial (RNC; dois pHs e n\u00e3o-amputa\u00e7\u00e3o; dois pHs e 15 dias p\u00f3s-\n\namputa\u00e7\u00e3o). O CF foi centrifugado para que fossem retirados os coelom\u00f3citos, designando-se desta \n\nforma fluido cel\u00f3mico livre de c\u00e9lulas (CFF). Este fluido foi submetido a centrifuga\u00e7\u00e3o e ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npara separar a fra\u00e7\u00e3o de alta massa molecular (prote\u00ednas) da fra\u00e7\u00e3o de baixa massa molecular. Esta \n\n\u00faltima cont\u00e9m asterosaponinas, mol\u00e9culas que s\u00e3o conhecidas por terem fun\u00e7\u00f5es importantes a \n\nn\u00edvel de sinaliza\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica mas tamb\u00e9m a n\u00edvel digestivo e reprodutivo, e que por isso \n\nconsider\u00e1mos essenciais neste estudo. Esta fra\u00e7\u00e3o foi ent\u00e3o sujeita a extra\u00e7\u00e3o de fase s\u00f3lida (SPE) \n\ncom diferentes elui\u00e7\u00f5es de acetonitrilo e \u00e1cido f\u00f3rmico para isolamento das asterosaponinas, e \n\nposteriormente analisadas por ESI-MS. Os dados foram adquiridos por um espectrofot\u00f3metro linear \n\nion trap mass Thermo Finnigan LTQ, controlado pelo software Xcalibur v 2.0, tamb\u00e9m usado na \n\nan\u00e1lise dos espectros resultantes da leitura das amostras. Todas as asterosaponinas investigadas \n\nestavam presentes no pH controlo, mas apenas duas delas foram detetadas em estrelas-do-mar \n\nsubmetidas a pH \u00e1cido. Para al\u00e9m disto, as suas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es diminu\u00edram em pH \u00e1cido. Tendo em \n\nconta que a A. rubens apresenta um baixa taxa de respira\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s 27 dias exposta a pH 7.7 do que \n\nquando submetida a pH 8.1, podemos assumir que este decr\u00e9scimo ir\u00e1 alterar a disponibilidade de \n\nATP, e consequentemente comprometer a bioss\u00edntese de asterosaponinas. Por sua vez, a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndestas biomol\u00e9culas poder\u00e1 ter efeitos negativos a n\u00edvel digestivo, atrav\u00e9s da redu\u00e7\u00e3o da absor\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde colesterol, mas poder\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m ter efeitos positivos ao n\u00edvel da preda\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nAs prote\u00ednas do CFF foram extra\u00eddas e precipitadas com recurso a \u00e1cido tricloroac\u00e9tico e beta-\n\nmercaptoetanol, enquanto as prote\u00ednas do RNC foram extra\u00eddas e precipitadas recorrendo a azoto \n\nl\u00edquido e a um buffer suplementado com SDS, Tris-HCl, DTT, um cocktail anti-protease e PMSF. A \n\nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o das prote\u00ednas do CFF e RNC foi feita com recurso ao QuantiPro BCA Assay KIT 0.5-\n\n30\u00b5g/mL protein, e a digest\u00e3o, embora diferente, teve como base o uso de redutores de pontes \n\npersulfureto (DTT e TCEP), iodoacetamida para alquila\u00e7\u00e3o das ciste\u00ednas e tripsina para quebrar a \n\nprote\u00edna em p\u00e9ptidos. As amostras digeridas de ambos os tecidos foram analisadas por nano LC-\n\nMS/MS. Foram identificadas 213 prote\u00ednas no RNC, mas apenas uma estava presente em todas as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es estudadas. Por esta raz\u00e3o, podemos concluir que o procedimento experimental deve ser \n\notimizado. A an\u00e1lise do CFF permitiu identificar 298 prote\u00ednas, das quais 19% eram comuns \u00e0s duas \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de pH. De acordo com estes resultados, 81% de todas as prote\u00ednas identificadas estavam \n\ndiferencialmente expressas. Comuns a ambas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de pH, e como esperado, foram \n\ndetetadas actinas, tubulinas e ubiquitinas. A quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o realizada permitiu observar um aumento \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\nde express\u00e3o significativo apenas em 2 prote\u00ednas no pH \u00e1cido: alfa-tubulina e vitellogenina 1. A \n\nprimeira est\u00e1 envolvida na forma\u00e7\u00e3o do citoesqueleto, e por isso, ser\u00e1 importante numa fase de \n\nr\u00e1pida prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celular. A segunda prote\u00edna \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel pelo transporte de l\u00edpidos para os \n\no\u00f3citos, e o seu aumento de express\u00e3o parece aumentar o n\u00famero de eventos de desova em \n\nestrelas-do-mar. Os baixos n\u00edveis de asterosaponinas presentes em pH \u00e1cido tamb\u00e9m parecem \n\nfavorecer este acontecimento, aumentando desta forma, o sucesso reprodutivo.  \n\nCom base em estudos recentes realizados em corais e em zoopl\u00e2ncton, previa-se um aumento \n\nna express\u00e3o de prote\u00ednas de stress em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de pH \u00e1cido. No entanto, no presente estudo, as \n\nestrelas-do-mar submetidas a esta condi\u00e7\u00e3o de pH, exibiram apenas uma prote\u00edna de stress. Para \n\nmelhor compreens\u00e3o dos efeitos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos em cada uma das prote\u00ednas aqui \n\nidentificas, ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio realizar estudos mais detalhados para avaliar o impacto biol\u00f3gico da \n\nexpress\u00e3o proteica diferencial que observ\u00e1mos. \n\n   \n\nPalavras-chave: acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o, A.

As more CO2 \u2013 and consequently H+accumulates in \nthe ocean, the lower will be the pH [55]. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n? Oc ean Ac i di fi c ati on  \n\nSince the start of the industrial revolution (XVIII century), atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide \n\n(CO2) have been rising at a far greater rate (from 280 to 380ppm, and is expected to double by 2100) \n\nthan previously experienced in Earth\u2019s history, primarily as a result of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) \n\nemissions from human activities [1] (Fig. 1, 2).  Consequently, CO2 dissolved in seawater also \n\nincrease, and will combine with water molecules to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This acid dissociates, \n\nand release a hydrogen ion (H+) and a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) until the chemical equilibrium is \n\nreached. Also, HCO3- releases H+ and a carbonate ion (CO32-). Most of the H+ released by the carbonic \n\nacid will subsequently combine with carbonate ions to form additional bicarbonate ions, thereby \n\nreducing the pool of carbonate ions [2]. This decrease has significant consequences for the chemistry \n\nof carbonate minerals that generally constitute shells, plates or skeletons of marine biota. The \n\nformation and dissolution of carbonate minerals can be represented as [1]:  \n\nMineral formation \n\n \n\nCaCO3    ?   [Ca2+]   +   [CO32-] \n\n \n\nDissolution \n\n \n\nOnce formed, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in these structures will dissolve back into the water \n\nunless the surrounding seawater contains sufficiently high concentrations of carbonate ions. In \n\nsummary, the chemical changes in seawater resulting from increased atmospheric CO2 \n\nconcentrations include increases in the concentrations of dissolved (or aqueous) carbon dioxide, \n\nhydrogen ions, and bicarbonate ions, and decreases in the carbonate ion concentration and pH [3] \n\n(Fig. 3). This group of related processes is denominated ocean acidification (OA) [4]. Some areas are \n\nFigure 1. Contribution to Earth\u2019s climate change of \n\ndifferent anthropogenic sectors (sources of greenhouse \n\ngas emissions) [56]. \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nregularly subjected to this process, such as \n\nupwelling regions, hydrothermal vents or intertidal \n\nzones [5] where organisms like echinoderms live in. \n\nAssuming that is difficult to achieve mineral \n\nformation under an acidic pH, calcifying \n\nechinoderms are predicted to be a highly sensitive \n\ntaxa to ocean acidification [6]. Dupont et al (2010) \n\n[7] under the assumption of a seawater pH \n\npredicted to occur by the year 2100 (?pH?-0.4 \n\nunits) tested two hypotheses: (1) owing to their calcite skeleton, sea star Crossaster papposus would \n\nbe negatively affected or (2) that owing to their lecithotrophic larvae, they may be more resistant to \n\nenvironmental changes. The larvae and juveniles raised at low pH grew and developed faster, with \n\nno negative effect on survival or skeletogenesis within the time frame of the experiment (38 days). \n\nThese results allowed the authors to reject the first hypothesis. Furthermore, this species seem to be \n\nnot only more resistant to OA, but is also performing better. Though, it is important to remember \n\nthat negative effects may appear in the longer term or on parameters not measured in this study \n\n(e.g. calcification rate). Also, the brittle star Amphiura filiformi can increase the rates of metabolism \n\nand the ability to calcify to compensate for increased seawater acidity [8]. Although, there are also \n\nstudies where negative effects are reported (collard 2013). \n\n \n\n? Ec hi nod er ms  \n\nThe ability to replace lost body parts or form a new functional tissue varies widely among \n\nanimals, and this variability of regenerative potential has long perplexed biologists [9]. Since the \n\nearliest experimental studies on regeneration during the 1700s, it has been clear that animals, like \n\namphibians, hydras, planarias, echinoderms or even humans differ substantially in their regeneration \n\nability [10], in part because it can occur at multiple levels of biological organization (cell, tissue, \n\ninternal organs, structure, or the whole body). Furthermore, it can be triggered by a variety of \n\ncauses, occur at different stages of the life cycle, proceed via a diversity of developmental processes \n\nand produce structures of variable fidelity relative to the original [9]. Among others, echinoderms \n\n(Phylum Echinodermata) - which belong to the superphylum Deuterostomia like vertebrates - is one \n\nof the groups usually chosen to study regeneration. It is divided in five classes: Echinoidea (sea \n\nurchins), Asteroidea (sea stars), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) and \n\nCrinoidea (feather stars) [11] (Fig. 4). They are exclusively marine and widely distributed in all \n\noceans, from the intertidal to the abyssal regions.  \n\nFigure 3. Chemical reaction responsible for the ocean \nacidification [57].  \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \n\nEchinoderms can be carnivorous, detritus foragers, or planktonic feeders, such as the sea star, \n\nsome sea cucumbers and basket stars (ophiuroids), respectively. All classes present radial symmetry \n\n\u2013 although juvenile states present bilateral symmetry \u2013 usually with five or more arms, and each of \n\nthese segments contain an exact replica of all internal organs [12]. They lack morphologically \n\ndifferentiated excretory organs and have a poor ability to osmo and ion regulate (osmoconformers) \n\nand that is why their coelomic fluid (CF) - the main circulatory medium - has an ionic composition \n\nsimilar to that of seawater [13]. Locomotion is accomplished using tentacle-like structures called \n\ntube feet, which are hydraulically controlled by a vascular system that moves water through canals of \n\ntheir small muscular tubes [14]. Along with this water vascular system, the CF ensure gas \n\ntransportation and is involved in cell-free (humoral) immune responses due to the presence of \n\nproteins secreted by the coelomocytes or by the surrounding tissue like the radial nerve cord (RNC) \n\n[13].  This part of the nervous system is located at the oral surface of animal, where it is exposed to \n\nthe outside environment. The RNC of each arm join together forming the circumoral nerve ring, \n\nwhich surround the mouth [15]. The fraction free of coelomocytes (acquired by centrifugation) was \n\ndesignated by us cell-free coelomic fluid (CFF) and is extremely rich in secreted molecules, like \n\ngrowth factors, hormones and neuropeptides, which are involved in cell signaling processes [14].  \n\n Echinoderms usually have separate sexes with no evident sexual dimorphism, and reproduction \n\nis typically achieved by external fertilization, with eggs and sperm freely released into seawater. The \n\nresulting embryos and larvae live as part of the plankton, or for others species, the eggs may be stuck \n\nto the undersides of rocks. Some species of sea star are able to reproduce asexually as adults either \n\nby fission of their central discs [16] or by autotomy (self-amputation behaviour) of one or more of \n\ntheir arms. One of most important features of Echinoderms is the presence of an endoskeleton in \n\nFigure 4. Examples of Echinoderms. a) Echinoidea, b) Ophiuroidea, c) \nAsteroidea, d) Holothuroidea and e) Crinoidea [58], [59] \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n Table 1. A. Rubens scientific classification. \n\nFigure 5. Asterias rubens [18] \n\npost-metamorphic stages, which in most species occupies a significant part of their dermis. This \n\nendoskeleton is composed of magnesium calcite (Ca-Mg-CO3) by a process called biocalcification that \n\nis biologically mediated and involves ion transport pathways in echinoderms. Although \n\nEchinodermata are osmoconformers, their coelomic fluid\u2019s pH is usually 0.5-1.5 units lower because \n\nof a high CO2 content, due to the slow elimination of this gas which is dependent on diffusion \n\ngradients for exchange with seawater. However, Collard et al., (2013) showed that the CF of the \n\ncommon sea star A. rubens was in equilibrium with seawater\u2019s pH after twenty four hours exposure \n\nto pH 7.7, with a slight difference of less 0.21-0.40 units [17]. Nevertheless, this filo present \n\nsignificant morphological and physiological plasticity that allows them to live in different \n\nenvironments, presenting different growth rates, reproductive periodicity and environmental \n\ntolerances [11].  \n\n \n\no Asterias rubens \n\n   The common sea star (Linnaeus, 1758; figure 5, table \n\n1) is the most prevalent sea star on the north-east Atlantic, \n\nbut can also be found from Arctic Norway, along Atlantic \n\ncoasts to Senegal, and only found occasionally in the \n\nMediterranean [18].  It is found on a variety of hard substrata \n\nand occurs from the upper tide mark down to about 400m, \n\nrarely down to 650m. It can also be found on mussel beds offshore. \n\nThey are usually orange, but may vary between pale brown to violet and exceptionally can grow up \n\nto 52cm in diameter [19]. Spreading from a central disc with a ventral mouth and a dorsal anus it has \n\n5 pointed arms. The upper surface is covered in spines which are surrounded by pedicellariae, tiny \n\npincers that discourage predators and keep detritus and other particulate matter from settling on \n\nthe animal. The most apical tube feet of each arm are modified light sensory organs and the rest are \n\nused for locomotion and capture prey, which consists of mainly bivalves like mussels and oysters but \n\nalso roes, carrion, gastropods, crabs, polychaete worms and other echinoderms like sea urchins, \n\nstarfishes, brittle stars and sea cucumbers [20].  \n\nFrom February to April the females release, through ventral \n\npores, about 2.5 million eggs each and stimulate the males \n\nchemically to release their sperm, therefore fertilization is external. \n\nA. rubens reaches maturity with one year but can live up to 5-10 \n\nyears [20]. \n\n \n\n \n\nKingdom Animalia \n\nPhylum Echinodermata \n\nClass Asteroidea \n\nOrder Forcipulata \n\nFamily Asteridae \n\nGenus Asterias \n\nSpecies rubens \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n? Aster osap oni ns  \n\nMainly produced by plants, but also found in lower marine animals like sea stars and some \n\nbacteria, saponins are naturally occurring surface-active glycosides [21]. Their name is derived from \n\ntheir ability to form stable, soap-like foams in aqueous solutions. These molecules consists of a sugar \n\nmoiety usually containing glucose, galactose, glucuronic acid, xylose, rhamnose or methylpentose, \n\nglycosidically linked to a hydrophobic aglycone (sapogenin) which may be triterpenoid in nature. \n\nThey are of high interest due to their hemolytic, cytotoxic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral and \n\nanti-tumor properties [21].  \n\nThree categories of saponins have been identified in sea stars, polyhydroxysteroids glycosides, \n\nmacrocyclic saponins and asterosaponins [22, 23], but only the latter was found in A. rubens [24]. \n\nAsterosaponins are ?9(11)-3?, 6?-dioxygenated steroids with a sulfate group attached at C-3 and an \n\noligosaccharide chain containing five or six sugar units at C-6, and can be characterized by a wide \n\ndegree of structural variability because individual compounds belonging to this class differ in their \n\nsteroidal side chain and/or in their sugar moiety. Yasumoto and his group (1966) surveyed all five \n\nclasses of echinoderms and found that only the holothurians and the asteroids elaborate these \n\ncompounds \u2013 responsible for their toxicity \u2013, while the echinoids, ophiuroids, and crinoids do not. \n\nThis finding reinforced the suspected close phylogenetic relationship of sea cucumbers and sea stars \n\neven though holothurians have triterpenoid aglycones while asteroids have steroid aglycones [25]. \n\nAsterosaponins are also known for being responsible for causing an \u2018escape response\u2019 on many \n\norganisms when in the presence of, or contact with sea stars, thereby reducing predation success \n\n[26]. Specifically in asteroids, it is generally considered that saponins may have a role also in \n\ndigestion, reproduction and chemical signaling [21].  \n\n \n\n? T he pr ot eomi c  ap pr o ac h  \n\nRecent studies suggest an uncoupling between transcript and protein levels in coccolithophores \n\nunder ocean acidification [27] that are in agreement with older studies performed in mammalian, \n\nyeast and bacterial cells [28; 30]. The coupling of these levels can be as low as 40%, depending on the \n\nsystem [31], therefore knowledge of protein expression pattern is necessary to understand the direct \n\nlink between ocean acidification stress and organism\u2019s response. The proteome, which is the \n\nexpressed protein complement of the genome, varies among tissues and over time, but represents \n\nthe final and stable product of many redundant gene expression processes [32; 33]. For example, to \n\naddress this question Dineshram et al. (2012) [34] performed 2-DE coupled with mass \n\nspectrophotometry to compare the global protein expression pattern of the wild Pacific oyster \n\nCrassostrea gigas larvae exposed to normal and high-CO2 conditions. Exposure to OA during 4 days \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nafter fertilization resulted in marked reduction of global protein expression with a decrease or loss of \n\n71 proteins (18% of the expressed proteins in control) indicating a wide-spread depression of \n\nmetabolic gene expression. Importantly, expression of proteins related to calcification and \n\ncytoskeleton production appears to be severally suppressed by OA.  \n\n \n\n? Hi g h Per for ma nc e Li qu i d C hr omat og r ap hy  l i nked w i th M S (HPLC -M S ) [3 5 ] \n\nAs in many cases, our compounds of interest are found as a part of a complex mixture, and the \n\nrole of the chromatography technique is to provide separation of the components of that mixture to \n\nallow their identification and/or quantitative determination. Quantification is achieved by \n\ncomparison of the intensity (\u2018peak\u2019 area) of response from samples of different experimental \n\nconditions.  \n\nThe separation of the components are associated with two phases: mobile and stationary. The \n\nformer is a liquid (in which the analytes are soluble) delivered under high pressure to ensure a \n\nconstant flow rate and thus reproducible chromatography, while the latter is packed into a column \n\ncapable of withstanding the high pressures which are necessary. The majority of HPLC separations \n\nhyphenated with MS utilize reversed-phase chromatography, i.e. the mobile phase is more polar \n\nthen the stationary phase, therefore analytes more polar elute more rapidly than the less polar ones. \n\nHPLC system is composed by a pump that delivers the mobile phase at a constant flow rate, an \n\ninjector, a chromatography column and a detector.  \n\n  \n\n? El ec tr ospr ay  I oni z ati o n  (ESI )  \n\nThe majority of ionization techniques employed in the analysis of biomolecules are \u2018soft \n\nionization\u2019s techniques which provide primarily molecular ions that occur at relatively high values of \n\nmass-to-charge ratio (m/z), rather than fragment ions which occur at relatively low m/z values. There \n\nare other ionization methods but we will only refer to the one used.  ESI technique consists of a \n\nliquid with the analyte of interest, which enters the ES chamber through a stainless steel hypodermic \n\nneedle [36] and pass through a capillary, at atmospheric pressure, maintained at high voltage.  The \n\nliquid is dispersed and forms charged droplets which are desolvated, usually by a stream of nitrogen, \n\nas they pass through the atmospheric-pressure region of the source towards a counter electrode. At \n\nthis point, the droplet deforms as the electrostatic repulsion of similar charges, in an ever-decreasing \n\ndroplet size, becomes more powerful than the surface tension holding the droplet together. The \n\ndroplets undergo \u2018Coulombic explosion\u2019 producing more stable droplets with a radius of \n\napproximately 10% of that of the parent droplet. These enters directly to a heated capillary and then \n\nare transferred through a series of focusing lenses into the mass spectrometer.  \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nThis system can allow quantification, but to obtain the best precision and accuracy during \n\nquantitative measurements an internal standard should be used. Analytical signals from both the \n\nanalyte and the internal standard are measured and the ratio of these two signal intensities (\u2018peak\u2019 \n\narea) are used to generate the calibration graph and to determine the amount of analyte present. \n\n \n\n? T andem -Mass sp ec tr o me tr y  (MS-M S)  \n\nThis way of generate structural information is applicable to all forms of ionization and covers a \n\nnumber of techniques in which one stage of mass spectrometry is used to isolate an ion of interest \n\nand a second stage is then used to probe the relationship of this ion with others from which it may \n\nhave been generated or which it may generate on decomposition. There are a large number of \n\ndifferent MS-MS experiments that can be carried out, for example, the product-ion scan, the \n\nprecursor-ion scan, the constant-neutral-loss scan and selected decomposition monitoring.  \n\nIn this work, the product-ion scan was used to asterosaponins\u2019 analysis, where the ion-trap \n\ngenerate product ions from a selected precursor ion, and any of these \u2018product\u2019 ions may be isolated, \n\ndissociated and a further product-ion spectrum obtained. In general, the first stage of mass \n\nspectrometry is performed to isolate an ion of interest and in the second stage, fragmentation of the \n\nion is effected, usually by collision with gas molecules in a collision cell. A mass spectrum of the \n\nproduct (fragment) ions is then provided. This is termed MS-MS-MS or MS3. This process can be \n\nrepeated, being designated by MSn. \n\n \n\n? N ano LC - MS/ M S  \n\nThe main difference from LC-MS to Nano-LC is that the latter has managed a gain in sensitivity \n\nthat allows the analysis of peptide mixtures in sample-limited situations (e.g., proteolytically digested \n\nproteins isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis). This nano system allows the use of small \n\namounts of samples due to its lower flow rate. This is possible because of the reduced column \n\ndiameter comparing to the conventional column diameter in LC-MS.  \n\n \n\n?

Essentially, it \n\nidentifies proteins on the basis of peptide mass spectra. These masses are analyzed, assigned a \n\nsequence, and a search in protein databases is made for the presence of the peptide sequences. The \n\nhigher the scores of the peptide sequences identified in the candidate protein, the higher the \n\nconfidence in the identification. \n\n \n\no Blast2GO 3.1.2 \n\nBlast2GO (B2G) is a bioinformatics platform for high-quality functional annotation and analysis \n\nof genomic datasets.

Although, it is \n\nalready known that some species have a faster regeneration recovery under low pH, and there may \n\nbe a molecular reason behind it. Therefore, this work had three main purposes to evaluate the effect \n\nof ocean acidification using two environmental pH values: 1) study how regeneration affects sea stars \n\narms\u2019 use, 2) compare CFF asterosaponins\u2019 composition in fifteen days post-amputated sea stars, and \n\nfinally 3) study proteins expression levels in CFF and RNC using a proteomic differential approach.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nMETHODOLOGY \n\n? Ani mal  tr i al s and r eg e ner ati on i n duc ti on  \n\nSea stars were collected at low tide and transported to the Sven Lov\u00e9n Center of Marine \n\nSciences, Kristineberg (Sweden) on September 2012, and kept in flowing natural deep seawater \n\nunder natural temperature and light regime (pH 8.06 \u00b1 0.07 units), salinity 32%, and alkalinity of 2.18 \n\n\u00b1 0.02mM as measured following Sarazin et al. (1999)[37]. Sea stars were visually inspected and only \n\nselected for the experiments if no previous signs of regeneration were present, such as different arm \n\nsize. They were fed ad libitum with frozen mussels. For the experimental manipulation, we selected a \n\nseawater pH (?pH ~ -0.4 units) predicted to occur by the year 2100 [4] and it was maintained in each \n\naquarium using a computerized control system (AquaMedic) that regulated pH by the addition of \n\npure gaseous CO2 directly into the experimental tank. The effect of two water pH-levels, pH=8.1 \n\n(pCO2 = 372ppm; ?ca = 3.2; ?ar = 2.0) and pH 7.7 (pCO2 = 930ppm; ?ca = 1.5; ?ar = 1.0), were \n\ntested on sea star arm regeneration. The former condition corresponds to control and the latter to \n\nocean acidification conditions. After anesthetizing starfish with 4% (w/v) magnesium chloride in \n\nseawater, regeneration was induced by amputation of the arm tip at 2/3 of the way down to the \n\narm, with 2 arm tips amputated per animal (arms adjacent to madreporite, figure 6). In total, ten \n\nexperimental groups were assayed (Table 2), including two pH conditions (control pH \u2013 CpH; low pH - \n\nLpH), two physical conditions (amputated/ablation - A#; non-amputated/non-ablation - NA) and in 4 \n\npost-amputation (PA) time points (1, 4, 9 and 14 days - A1, A4, A9 and A14, respectively).  \n\n \n\n? B ehav i our  tr i al s  \n\nThe aim of these trials was to access recovery of lost mobility after sea star arm tips ablation. \n\nEach animal was assayed individually, after positioned in the center of a tank maintained in the \n\nabove described seawater conditions. For 2 minutes it was observed with which arm(s) the animal \n\npreferentially leaded its displacement.  Two arm groups were assigned: \n\namputated arms (AA) and non-amputated arms (NAA). \n\nFigure 6. How arms were \ndesignated according to \nmadreporite (red circle). \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n\n? Sampl e C ol l ec ti on  \n\nTo collect the RNC, we followed a procedure previously described by Franco et al., (2012) [38]. \n\nThe internal fluid of the sea star was collected by puncturing the animal epidermis at the arm tip \n\nwith a needle and collecting the fluid by gravity into an ice cold recipient. After collection and to \n\nprevent endogenous proteolysis, both tissues were immediately immersed in an ice cold solution of \n\nPBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (SIGMAFAST Complete Inhibitor Tablets), flash \n\nfrozen in liquid N2 and conserved at ?80\u00baC until further use. Previous to freezing and to avoid \n\ncoelomocytes lysis, low speed centrifugation (800xg, 10 minutes) was used to separate the coelomic \n\nfluid from the circulating cells (CFF fraction).

The low \n\nmolecular mass fraction (<5kDa) was used to perform solid phase extraction (SPE) for separation of \n\nasterosaponins. Previous to use, SPE cartridges (Strata-X 33u polymeric reversed phase, \n\nPhenomenex) were inserted into a SPE vacuum manifold and washed with 3 mL methanol and 3 mL \n\n5% (v/v) formic acid (FA). Filtrates obtained from ultrafiltration were sequentially eluted from SPE \n\ncartridges with 1 mL of increasing acetonitrile (ACN) concentrations (15, 25, 35, 45, 55 of 75% ACN \n\n(v/v) containing 5% FA (v/v)). Resultant fractions for each biological replicate were stored overnight \n\nat 4\u00baC, vacuum dried (SpeedVac concentrator, Thermo) and resuspended in 5% (v/v) FA. After use, \n\nSPE cartridges were regenerated with 100% (v/v) ACN.  \n\nCFF proteins were precipitated overnight at 4\u00baC with 7.5 mL 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) \n\nand 0.07% (v/v) ?-mercaptoethanol. Then, they were centrifuged 10 min at 4\u00baC and 16 000xg and \n\nwashed three times with 70% acetone (v/v) containing 0.7% ?-mercaptoethanol (v/v) to complete \n\nremoval of TCA. Next, samples were vacuum dried and resuspended in 50\u00b5L of 6M urea 50mM \n\nammonium bicarbonate (BA).  \n\n?

The tissue (~100mg) was kept frozen in liquid N2 and placed in a previously chilled Teflon \n\nsample chamber containing four stainless steel beads (5mm diameter). The chamber was placed in a \n\nMikro-Dismembrator (Sartorius) and set to 3000rpm for 60s. To avoid sample loss, the resulting \n\npowder (still in a deep frozen state) was resuspended in 500\u00b5L of hypotonic lysis buffer  (5% SDS, \n\n100mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 100mM DTT, supplemented with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail and 1mM \n\nPMSF). The resulting product was incubated 5 minutes at 95\u00baC and centrifuged to remove cellular \n\ndebris and insoluble material (16 000xg, 10 min, 20\u00b0C). The supernatant was transferred into a 10kDa \n\nMWCO filter unit (Amicon Ultra 0.5mL) and 200\u00b5L of Buffer UA (8M urea in 100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) \n\nwas added.

Posteriorly it was mixed at 600rpm for 1 min and \n\nincubated 20 min at room temperature. A centrifugation was performed at 14 000xg for 10 min, the \n\nfiltrate discarded and 100\u00b5L of Buffer UA added to the filter unit. The samples were centrifuged \n\nagain at 14 000xg for 15 min, the filtrate discarded and 100\u00b5L of alkylation solution (50mM \n\nIodoacetamide in Buffer UA) added. Mixing 1 min at 600rpm and incubation at room temperature in \n\nthe dark for 20 minutes was performed. An additional centrifugation (14 000xg, 10 min) was made, \n\nthe filtrate discarded and 100\u00b5L of Buffer UA added. This step was repeated 2 additional times. \n\nAnother centrifugation was performed, the filtrate discarded and 100\u00b5L of 50mM BA added. This \n\nstep was repeated 2 additional times. One more centrifugation was made and 40\u00b5L of 0.05\u00b5g/\u00b5L \n\ntripsin and 0.8\u00b5L of 100mM CaCl2 were added to the filter unit that was then transferred to a new \n\ncollection tube. Samples were vortexed at 600rpm for 1 min and then incubated at 37\u00baC for 14h. \n\nPosteriorly, the samples were centrifuged 15 min at 14 000xg (the filtrate was not discarded because \n\nit had the digested peptides) and 100\u00b5L of 50mM BA were added. This step was repeated 2 \n\nadditional times and a last centrifugation was performed. FA was added to the filtrate to have a 5% \n\nfinal concentration and the filter discarded. The peptides were vacuum dried and resuspended in \n\n100\u00b5L of 0.2% FA. The samples were stored at -80\u00baC until further analysis. \n\n \n\n? Anal y si s of aster os ap o ni ns by  ESI -t an dem M S  \n\nOnly the 55% and 75% acetonitrile elutions of the low molecular mass CFF fraction were \n\nanalyzed due to previous non-published experiments, where not significant intensities for \n\nasterosaponins were detected. ESI-MS/MS data were acquired with a Thermo Finnigan LTQ linear ion \n\ntrap mass spectrometer. Before analysis, 30\u00b5L (v/v) of methanol were added in order to facilitate the \n\ngas phase ion formation during the electrospray ionization process. Ten \u00b5L of 10mg/L peptide (Ae-\n\nVFFAED-NH2) was used as standard for relative quantification. The capillary temperature was set to \n\n275\u00baC, the spray voltage was set to 5kV for negative mode. The tune parameters optimized (m/z \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n766) were set to -43V and -113.89V for capillary and tube lens voltage, respectively. The sample \n\nsolutions were infused at a flow rate of 5\u00b5L/min directly into the mass spectrometer. Mass spectra in \n\nfull scan acquisition mode were acquired within the mass range of m/z 200-2000. All the detected \n\nMS m/z values possessing minimum normalized intensity of 10% were considered relevant. Between \n\nMS analysis, the injection system and MS equipment were washed with ACN in order to avoid \n\npossible carryover. MS/MS analysis of all the selected precursors was done by CID using helium as a \n\ncollision gas, with a normalized collision energy of 30%, an activation time of 30ms and a radio-\n\nfrequency of 0.250. ESI-tandem MS was controlled by Xcalibur v 2.0 software which was used also to \n\nperform data analysis.  \n\nBased on previous trials involving A. rubens CFF asterosaponins characterization, the m/z values \n\nsearched in the obtained MS spectra were 1143, 1157, 1227, 1243, 1257, 1273, 1373, 1389 and \n\n1405. Each asterosaponin was only considered present in the sample when the compound intensity \n\nwere two-fold the background noise value. We estimated the percentage of background noise \n\nvisually, multiplied that value by the higher absolute intensity in that spectrum and divided it by one \n\nhundred. We also considered that each asterosaponin was present in an experimental group when \n\nthey were detected in at least two of the three replicates/pools. \n\n \n\n? N ano LC - MS/ M S  \n\nThe CFF and RNC samples were analyzed on a Maxis Impact q-TOF spectrometer (Bruker, \n\nBremen), coupled to a nano-HPLC system (Proxeon, Denmark). One \u00b5g of each injected sample \n\ndissolved in 5% ACN and 0.1% FA in water, were first concentrated on a 100 \u00b5m ID, 2cm Proxeon \n\nnanotrapping column and then loaded onto a 75 \u00b5m ID, 25 cm Acclaim PepMap nanoseparation \n\ncolumn (Thermo). The chromatography was run using a 0.1% FA - ACN gradient (2-30% in 120 min for \n\ntotal lysates digests at a flow rate 300nL/min). The column was coupled to the mass spectrometer \n\ninlet through a Captive Spray (Bruker) ionization source. MS acquisition was set to cycles of MS (2Hz), \n\nfollowed by 3 second cycles of MS/MS (4-16Hz, intensity depending) of a variable number of the \n\nmost intense precursor ions, with an intensity threshold for fragmentation of 2000 counts, and using \n\na dynamic exclusion time of 2 min, with an automated precursor re-selection when a 3 fold increase \n\nin intensity was observed. All spectra were acquired on the range 150-2200 Da. LC-MS/MS data was \n\nanalyzed using the Data Analysis 4.2 software (Bruker).  \n\nCFF proteins were quantified using MaxQuant 1.5.2.8 software. For RNC data, we did not had \n\nreplicates and for that reason it was not possible to quantify. CFF and RNC proteins were identified \n\nusing the Data Analysis 4.2 software (Bruker) to interpret LC-MS/MS and ProteinScape 3.1 using \n\nMASCOT search engine (version 2.2) and an echinoderm database generated by us using NCBI \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nprotein sequences for all five classes. MS/MS spectra were searched with a precursor mass tolerance \n\nof 10 ppm, fragment tolerance of 0.05 Da, trypsin specificity with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages, \n\ncysteine carbamidomethylation set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation as variable \n\nmodification. Significance threshold for the identifications was set to p<0.05, minimum MASCOT ions \n\nscore of 20. After, samples were subjected to Blast2GO 3.1.2 for the assignment of information about \n\nthe biological function and cellular location, by making use of NCBI BLAST web service, swissprot \n\ndatabase and a blast expectation value of 0.001.   \n\n  \n\n?

B ehav i our  tr i al s  \n\nThe average number of leading movements of amputated and non-amputated sea star arms (AA \n\nand NAA, respectively) in two environmental conditions (control and acidic pH) and in 4 post-\n\namputation time-points (A1, A4, A9 and A14) is discriminated in figure 7. Statistical tests comparing \n\nno-ablation (NA) and each post-ablation (PA) time-point for each arm group and pH condition are \n\nonly presented in Supplement 1. \n\nIn the present study, A. rubens did not choose a preferential arm to lead the movement neither \n\nfor CpH (p=0.93) or for LpH (p=0.23). As described by Ji et al. (2012) [40] and Cole (1913) [41], under \n\nfree crawling conditions arm 5 seems to be the leading arm for A. amurensis and A. forbesi, \n\nrespectively. Although, Ji et al. observed a more pronounced use of this arm in a fleeing situation \n\nthat could be explained by a concentration of sense organs and nervous system in anterior side, \n\nsupporting the theory of a bilateral behaviour in sea stars. Inconsistencies between our results and \n\ntheirs may be due to different experimental procedures and criteria used for leading arm record. \n\nRegarding pH effect, Collard et al., (2013) [5] did not observed any influence in the mechanical \n\nproperties of A. rubens tube feet. \n\nIn our study, one day after ablation the number of movements of AA were significantly higher at \n\nCpH, but without differences for the remaining time-points. No differences were observed between \n\npH conditions for NAA at any time-point. When comparing both arm groups, NAA were responsible \n\nfor a significant higher number of movements at both pH conditions, except for CpH/A9 and for \n\nFigure 7. Weighted average number of movements of amputated and non-amputated arms (AA and NAA) \nin two pH experimental groups (CpH and LPH), and four PA time-points (A1, A4, A9 and A14). Different \nletters are used for statistically different observations in the same time-point only for intra and inter pH \nconditions, respectively between the two arm groups and within each arm group (see Supplement 2). \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nLpH/A14.  Since day 9, AA increased their number of movements in both pH conditions, returning to \n\nthe values observed for the NA condition.  The NAA increased significantly the number of leading \n\nmovements at this time-point and subsequently. The fact that we did not observed differences in \n\nNAA between pH conditions at any studied time-point is supported by several studies. Wood et al., \n\n(2011) showed that the artic brittlestar Ophiocten sericeum did not show difference in the \n\npercentage of functionally recovered arm regrown between the three pH treatments studied (7.3, \n\n7.7 and 8.3) when subjected to an ambient temperature [42]. Although, for another brittlestar, \n\nAphiura filiformis, an increase of arm regeneration rate was observed at an acidic pH, together with a \n\ndecrease in muscular mass. Furthermore, Schram et al., (2011) reported no significant differences of \n\narm regeneration rates between two pH treatments (7.8 and 8.2) for the asteroidea Luidia clathrate. \n\nThe reduced seawater pH had no effect on the biochemical composition of the body wall of \n\nregenerating or intact arms, and it appears that despite the combined stress of regeneration and \n\nexposure to CO2-driven seawater acidification, L. clathrata was able to consume sufficient nutrients \n\nto support functional regeneration of lost arms. It is known that lack of adequate nutrition resulted \n\nin preferential allocation of energy to the development of the pyloric caeca of intact arms, with \n\nsubsequent energy secondarily allocated to arm growth [43]. In our work, sea stars were feed ad \n\nlibitum, which mean they also did not had this constrain, and for that reason, they maintained the \n\nregeneration rate.  \n\n \n\n? Anal y si s of C FF ast er os apo ni ns usi ng  U F -SPE -E SI -M S ap pr o ac h  \n\nThe main purpose of the experimental work using CFF\u2019s low molecular mass fraction (<5 kDa) \n\nwas to detect and quantify the asterosaponins present in regenerating sea stars submitted to CpH \n\nand LpH conditions after 15 days in a regeneration situation.  \n\nFractions 55% and 75% were injected and analyzed by ESI-MS. An example of a mass spectrum \n\nfor each pH condition are presented in Supplement 3, and the fragmentation patterns MS2 and MS3 \n\nfor m/z 1243 are shown in Supplement 4 also as an example. A list of mass losses of all detected \n\nasterosaponins is presented in Table 4. Nine asterosaponins were detected in CpH, whereas only two \n\nof these were detected in LpH conditions (m/z 1243 and 1257; Table 3). Identifications were made \n\nbased only on [M-H]- m/z values and their fragmentation patterns. Retention times could have been \n\nalso used to have a more reliable identification, since the same m/z value can have different \n\nretention times [44], and consequently have a different molecular composition. In another sea star \n\nspecies submitted to regeneration, M. glacialis, asterosaponins with m/z 1227, 1259, 1243, 1373 and \n\n1389 were present [14]. Only one more was detected when no amputation was inflicted (m/z 1405). \n\nThis last asterosaponin was also detected in our samples from CpH/A15. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nTable 3.

It was observed that the ratios for m/z 1243 and 1257 \n\ndecreased from mean values of 14 and 21 in CpH to values of 3 and 2 in LpH group, respectively (a \n\ndecrease of around 4 and 9 times, respectively). Although there is a high variation coefficient value, a \n\ndecrease was observed for all LpH replicates and for both asterosaponins.  \n\nAll together these data show that a decline of 0.4 pH units cause a decrease on the number of \n\ndetected asterosaponins. The two asterosaponins detected in both pHs, m/z 1243 and 1257, were \n\nalso among the most abundant in a Demeyer et al. (2014) [44] report. They showed their presence in \n\nall A. rubens body components studied (aboral body wall, oral body wall, stomach, pyloric caeca and \n\ngonads). This is also true for m/z 1227 and 1273. Both studies revealed that asterosaponins \n\nconcentrations differ greatly among individuals, which corresponds to a huge biological variability in \n\nthis species. There is also known that sea star\u2019 asterosaponins present seasonal fluctuation, having a \n\nhigher concentration during June and July [25]. Furthermore, Demeyer et al. (2014) [44] confirmed \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nsignificant diversity of asterosaponins among organs, being detected a larger number in oral and \n\naboral body walls and a higher concentration in the latter and in the gonads. In the literature it is also \n\nsuggested that in sea star, asterosaponins may play a role as a spawning inhibitor [46], an important \n\nfeature for the control of reproduction.  \n\nConsidering that A. rubens present a lower respiration rate after 27 days at pH 7.7 than at pH \n\n8.1 [5], we can hypothesize that at time-point A15 the cellular respiration was diminished, leading to \n\na lower ATP availability, which could compromise asterosaponins biosynthesis. These events may \n\nexplain our results, in which a decrease of the number of asterosaponins detected was observed, but \n\nalso a reduction in the concentration of the ones present in acidic pH environment. This may have \n\nnegative impact on their digestive function, by reducing the ability to absorb cholesterol. Although, \n\nthere are positive effects in their chemical signaling functions, enhancing predation ability when an \n\n\u2018escape response\u2019 event is involved. \n\n  \n\n? Anal y si s of C FF pr otei n s usi ng  N ano -LC  ap pr o ac h  \n\nSeveral works  regarding A. rubens subjected to arm regeneration has been published (e.g.: ref \n\n[17]) but not at the proteomic level. One limitation when performing this type of approach is the \n\nabsence of an annotated genome for Asteroidea. For this reason the current study is, in its majority, \n\na homology-driven proteomic characterization, usually with S. purpuratus, the closest phylogenetic \n\nrelative with a sequenced genome. In this study, 66% of all identified proteins are homologs to the \n\nproteins of this sea urchin. As previously mentioned, we performed relative quantification of CFF \n\nproteins using mass spectrometry data and MaxQuant software. Only two of the 31 proteins \n\nidentified were differentially expressed between pH conditions (p<0.05), showing a significant \n\nintensity increase at low pH (Table 4). This event can correspond to a positive response from the \n\norganism, since these proteins, Vitellogenin 1 and alpha-tubulin1, are respectively responsible for \n\ndeposition of yolk substances in the oocytes [47], and for cytoskeleton structure [48]. Actin was \n\nexpressed in both pH conditions.  \n\nSince we reported a decrease in asterosaponins at an acidic pH, and knowing that these \n\nmolecules are spawning inhibitors [46], the increase in vitellogenin expression is required to couple \n\nwith an intensive oocytes production. Additionally, Dupont et al., (2010) showed for C. papposus, \n\nlarvae and juveniles raised at low pH grow and develop faster. The combined effects of an increase in \n\nvitellogenin expression and a decrease in asterosaponins biosynthesis appears to contribute to an \n\nenhanced reproductive ability at an acidic pH.  \n\nAs mentioned before [49], A. rubens present an increased cellular proliferation at a control pH \n\nenvironment between 7 and 21 days post-amputation. Consequently, this will involve cytoskeleton \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nFigure 9. Number of identified CFF \nproteins detected in common and in \neach pH condition. \n\nbiogenesis. Eventually, at an acidic pH for A15, cellular proliferation increases and a higher alpha-\n\ntubulin expression will be need for the cytoskeleton formation. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4. Statistical analysis of proteins\u2019 quantification results: t-Student tests were performed in LFQ intensity values \nof proteins present in CpH and LpH environments. Significant differences were considered for p<0,05. \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter Blast2GO analysis, we compared GO terms annotations from all CFF proteins identified at \n\nboth CpH and LpH samples, and no differences were observed among the several classes (Figures 7 \n\nand 8). Data show that the most represented biological processes (BP) are biological regulation, \n\nresponse to stimulus, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and cellular, developmental, \n\nmetabolic, multicellular organismal and single-organism processes. The two major molecular \n\nfunctions (MF) represented are binding and catalytic activity. All these GO terms are represented by \n\nmore than 6% and 10% of all identified proteins, for BP and MF, respectively. For more details on GO \n\nterms see Supplement 6.Although no differences were observed in the GO terms, differences are \n\nobvious when comparing the list of proteins (Figure 9). From 186 proteins identified in LpH group \n\nand 168 in CpH group, 56 are common (a detailed table for all proteins identified, \u201cCFF protein \n\nidentification\u201d, is supplied in CD-ROM).  It is worth to mention that the list of proteins used to create \n\nthe GO terms\u2019 graphs is not the same used to construct the Venn diagram. Shortly, B2G homology \n\nsearch was done against a general database without taxonomy restrictions, so we only used it for GO \n\nannotation. Although more than one hundred proteins are different between pH conditions (figure \n\n9), this is not reflected in GO terms distribution (figures 7 and 8). The total number of CFF proteins \n\nidentified in our study (298), is in agreement with Dheilly et al., (2013) [48] that identified 307 \n\nproteins in S. purpuratus, although trough different methods.In this work, as in ours, many proteins \n\nhad multiple homologs, which included actin, tubulin and heat \n\nshock proteins. From 298 proteins identified, 227 were \u201cPredicted\u201d, \n\n54 \u201cuncharacterized\u201d, 6 \u201cputative\u201d and 4 \u201chypothetical\u201d.  \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNCBI \naccession \nnumber \n\nDescription \nCpH (relative \n\nintensity) \nLpH (relative \n\nintensity) \np-value \n\n587759606 vitellogenin 1 [Patiriella regularis] 910.000 8.529.200 0,011 \n\n21667221 \nalpha-tubulin 1, partial [Strongylocentrotus \ndroebachiensis] \n\n653463 2.555.500 0,018 \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n...\n\nFigure 7.

Although, we were \n\npredicting an HSP expression increase under a low pH condition, based on recent reports concerning \n\ncorals and zooplankton [50, 51]. But surprisingly, they were found only at CpH (HSP90-alpha-isoform, \n\nHSP70 protein 1-like, heat shock cognate 71kDa protein or Hsc71), with exception of one that was \n\npresent at the LpH condition (heat shock 70 kDa protein IV-like). General functions of stress proteins \n\ninclude protein folding, peptide chaperone, cytoprotection, intracellular signaling, cell-cycle control \n\nand buffering of harmful mutations [52]. Besides HSPs, nine ubiquitin homologs were found in both \n\npH conditions, as expected. Attachment of a short chain of ubiquitins, for example, to a lysine, tags \n\nthe protein for intracellular proteolytic destruction by a proteasome [53]. This is reported for M. \n\nglacialis for a regeneration condition [54].  \n\nNext, we will discuss the proteins identified in only one of the pH conditions studied, and in their \n\nmajority also identified in Dheilly et al. (2013) [48] work, as seen in supplements provided in the CD-\n\nROM.  \n\no CFF proteins detected in control pH  \n\nIn this condition it were identified myosin V, interaptin, nesprin-1, dynein heavy chain 3 and 5, \n\nand avdillin as being involved in the dynamic properties of actin filaments and cytoskeletal \n\nmodifications. Involved in immune response we found complement C2-like, that is a part of the \n\ncomplement system, which evolved as a supplement of the innate immune system. This protein is, \n\namong others, responsible for the formation of an enzymatic activity called a C3 convertase, that \n\neventually will help opsonize pathogens, and induce a series of inflammatory responses that help to \n\nfight infection [53]. A transport protein SFT2, responsible for vesicle-mediated transport was found, \n\nas for a Na+/K+ ATPase alpha-1 subunit, which is located in the membrane to act like a \n\nsodium/potassium-exchanging ATPase activity. We also found sodium channel and clathrin linker 1, \n\nsodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 2 isoform X1 and sodium/glucose cotransporter 4. A very \n\nimportant protein involved in cell cycle control, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 was also identified.  \n\no CFF proteins detected in low pH  \n\nIn pH 7.7 we found Ras-related protein Rab-33 isoform X1 and Ras-related protein Rab-10 \n\nisoform X1, which are small GTPases responsible for regulating intracellular membrane trafficking \n\nand formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Acting in cell signaling it were \n\nidentified hexokinase and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6. In humans, apoptosis-\n\ninducing factor 2, a flavoprotein oxidoreductase, binds single stranded DNA and is thought to \n\ncontribute to apoptosis in the presence of bacterial and viral DNA. The expression of the gene that \n\nencode this protein is also found to be induced by tumor suppressor protein p53 in colon cancer \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nFigure 10.

Involved in stress response, it was identified catalase, which help protect against the \n\ndestructive effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Only identified in this pH was lysozyme, an \n\nenzyme abundant in most vertebrates body fluids, lyses both Gram-positive and negative bacteria, \n\nand interact directly or indirectly to modulate the complement activation cascade [48]. Histone H3 \n\nand histone H2A are involved in cell cycle. The former plays a key role in guaranteeing tension-\n\nsensing function in mitosis, while the latter may be required for proper centromere function during \n\nchromosome segregation in S. cerevisiae. Talin-1 isoform X2 are known to link integrins to the actin \n\ncytoskeleton, inhibits cadherin transcription and is involved in phagocytosis in mammals. But in \n\nechinoderms its function is not clear. Also acting in an actin-based cytoskeleton we identified \n\ncingulin-like protein 1. Tenascin-R-like is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein of the central nervous \n\nsystem. Hamartin is possibly a tumor suppressor. Chymotrypsin B is a pancreatic serine proteinase \n\nknown to cleave substrates selectively at peptide bonds formed by some hydrophobic residues, like \n\ntryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Beta-arrestin-1 is essentially signal transductor inhibitor.  \n\nTo better understand the effect of a low pH environment in each protein identified here, more \n\nstudies have to be perform detailing the biological impact of the differential expressions observed. \n\n \n\n?

The nano LC-\n\nMS/MS allowed identification of 213 proteins, although only one was common to all conditions \n\nstudied (Figure 10). This result lead us to conclude that an optimization of the experimental \n\nprocedure used should be performed. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThe aim of this work was to study the effect of the future predicted ocean acidification \n\nconditions under arm regeneration in the common sea star, Asterias rubens. First, it was observed \n\ntheir preference in choosing a leading arm when subjected to several regeneration time-points under \n\na control and an acidic pH. It was concluded that they do not have a preferred leading arm before \n\nablation in both pHs. Although, one day after amputation, and as expected, the number of \n\nmovements of the amputated arms drastically decrease, being significantly higher the control pH \n\ncondition. Since day 9, amputated arms restored their initial number of movements, and non-\n\namputated arms increased it. We can conclude that at this time-point, normal movement was \n\nrecovered.  \n\nWe also searched for the presence of asterosaponins, molecules that have digestive, \n\nreproductive and chemical signaling functions. We observed that two of the nine molecules detected \n\nin the control pH, were also detected in low pH samples (m/z 1243 and 1257). Furthermore, their \n\nconcentration decreased, suggesting that acidic pH may alter their biosynthesis. Nevertheless, \n\nfurther studies are needed to understand the effect of these lower levels of asterosaponins in A. \n\nrubens\u2019 biological processes. \n\nFinally we performed a differential proteomic approach on the radial nerve cord and cell-free \n\ncoelomic fluid tissues. The former analysis suggests an optimization of the experimental procedure \n\nused. Although, CFF analysis allowed identification of 298 proteins, of which 19% were common to \n\nboth conditions. According to these results, 81% of all proteins identified were differentially \n\nexpressed among pH 7.7 and 8.1, and future studies should emphasis this aspect in order to better \n\nunderstand their functions.  \n\nMerging all the results, we propose a correlation between an acidic environment and \n\nasterosaponins\u2019 biological effects. The decline in diversity and amount of these biomolecules can be \n\ncaused by already known decreases in respiratory rate and cholesterol absorption. Although, \n\nasterosaponins might have positive effects in predation and reproduction. The detected increase in \n\nvitellogenin expression seems to be associated with the amplified spawning event induced by the \n\nlow levels of asterosaponins at acidic pH, thereby also enhancing reproduction.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n[1] The Royal Society, \u201cOcean acidification due to increasing,\u201d no.
