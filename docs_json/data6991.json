Todo \neste trabalho de doutoramento n\u00e3o teria existido sem o seu planeamento e concep\u00e7\u00e3o do plano \nde trabalhos inicial. Todos os momentos passados em conjunto foram extremamente \nenriquecedores. Desde j\u00e1 o meu grande obrigado e espero que ter estado \u00e0 altura \ndas expectativas criadas, desejando muito mais trabalho conjunto no futuro.\n\nAo Doutor David Chew o muito obrigado pela aceita\u00e7\u00e3o em ser meu orientador, pela sua \npermanente disponibilidade, paci\u00eancia, aten\u00e7\u00e3o e troca de conhecimentos. O seu pragmatismo \ncarregado de confian\u00e7a permitiram ultrapassar as situa\u00e7\u00f5es mais adversas quando tudo parecia \nperdido. Sem o seu auxilio e clareza, o planeamento inicial n\u00e3o teria sido t\u00e3o eficaz.\n\nAo Doutor Raul Jorge pela amizade e disponibilidade tanto para o trabalho de campo e \nlaboratorial como para longos debates e esclarecimento sobre as d\u00favidas que iam surgindo. \nUm muito obrigado por tudo.\n\nDurante todo o per\u00edodo dos trabalhos de doutoramento, muitas foram as pessoas que me \najudaram de v\u00e1rias maneiras e \u00e0s quais gostaria de deixar uma palavra sincera de \nagradecimento, nomeadamente:\n\nUm especial agradecimento \u00e0 Doutora Z\u00e9lia Pereira e ao Doutor Narciso Ferreira do LNEG \nde S\u00e3o Mamede de Infesta pela utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus laborat\u00f3rio e pela hospitalidade e carinho \ndurante as estadias no Porto. Mais a sul, no LNEG de Beja, ao Doutor Jo\u00e3o Matos pela \npreciosa informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre os afloramentos e disponibilidade para localizar e facilitar as \namostras num labirinto de sondagens.\n\nDurante as longas estadias em Dublin, o acolhimento, preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e interesse demonstradas \npelo Doutor Geoof Clayton foram de grande conforto. Nos laborat\u00f3rios, o \u201cterror\u201d e ajuda \nprestada pelo Frank foram de estrema import\u00e2ncia. Para ambos, muito obrigado.\n\nAo Doutor Fin Stuart e \u00e0 Doutora Luigia pela disponibilidade em me receberem no SUERC, \nem Glasgow, e apresentarem-me aos \u201cdeuses\u201d do H\u00e9lio, abrindo-me assim uma porta para um \nmundo misterioso. Pela paci\u00eancia, compreens\u00e3o a extrema aten\u00e7\u00e3o prestada, apesar do caos \nlaboratorial provocado, um muito obrigado \n\nDurante este percurso existiram muitos momentos bons, e outros menos bons, nos quais tive \nsempre a companhia de muitos colegas e amigos que me apoiaram. Felizmente foram muitos, \ne, cada um \u00e0 sua maneira, tiveram um papel importante neste trabalho. Sem a vossa ajuda \nteria sido muito mais dif\u00edcil. Muito obrigado a todos!\n\nObrigado a toda a minha fam\u00edlia pelo o apoio incondicional desde sempre. Em particular \u00e0 \nminha m\u00e3e pelas longas e \u00e1rduas horas a processar uma quantidade enorme de amostras para \nque eu conseguisse ter tudo feito dentro do per\u00edodo estabelecido.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, este trabalho n\u00e3o teria sido poss\u00edvel sem o apoio financeiro da Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a \nCi\u00eancia e Tecnologia, atrav\u00e9s da bolsa de doutoramento

hist\u00f3ria t\u00e9rmica da Zona Sul Portuguesa e da Bacia do Algarve \n\nfoi realizado um estudo sistem\u00e1tico com aux\u00edlio de tr\u00eas metodologias complementares: \n\nmedi\u00e7\u00e3o da reflect\u00e2ncia da vitrinite, data\u00e7\u00f5es de tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o e de data\u00e7\u00f5es (U-Th)/He de \n\napatites. A vitrinite \u00e9 um grupo de maceral que deriva das paredes celulares ou dos tecidos \n\nlenhosos de plantas, e que \u00e9 bastante abundante em rochas sedimentares, em particular em \n\nmargas e xistos argilosos. A reflect\u00e2ncia da vitrinite \u00e9 sens\u00edvel \u00e0 temperatura num processo \n\nirrevers\u00edvel, ou seja, indica a temperatura m\u00e1xima a que uma rocha sedimentar esteve sujeita \n\ndurante a diag\u00e9nese, sendo um excelente indicador da matura\u00e7\u00e3o das rochas fonte de \n\nhidrocarbonetos. Para esse efeito, foram recolhidas sessenta e cinco amostras de rochas de \n\nafloramentos do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo, da Bacia do Algarve e da Bacia de Viar. \n\nForam ainda recolhidas dez amostras em dois furos de prospec\u00e7\u00e3o mineira que interceptaram \n\na Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de M\u00e9rtola do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo. As litologias selecionadas \n\nforam xistos argilosos, margas e argilitos. Os tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o s\u00e3o defeitos criados na estrutura \n\ncristalina dos cristais devido ao decaimento por fiss\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea do 238U. Os tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o \n\nficam preservados no cristal quando a temperatura ambiente das rochas permanece abaixo da \n\ntemperatura de annealing (\u201creset\u201d), que no caso da apatite se situa entre os 60 e os 120\u00baC, \n\ndependendo entre outros, do conte\u00fado em Cl. Medindo os tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o e determinando o \n\nconte\u00fado dos diferentes is\u00f3topos de U, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel determinar o per\u00edodo em que o cristal, e \n\nconsequentemente toda a rocha, ter\u00e1 permanecido sob temperaturas inferiores \u00e0 de annealing. \n\nJ\u00e1 as data\u00e7\u00f5es pelo m\u00e9todo (U-Th)/He consistem nas medi\u00e7\u00f5es dos is\u00f3topos  4He, U e Th \n\npresente em cada cristal. \u00c0 semelhan\u00e7a dos tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o, estas idades v\u00e3o sendo \n\nprogressivamente \u201capagadas\u201d com o aquecimento, ocorrendo o reset total aproximadamente \n\naos 75\u00baC nos minerais de apatite.  \n\nNo sentido de inferir sobre a proveni\u00eancia das forma\u00e7\u00f5es do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo \n\nAlentejo e do Tri\u00e1sico da Bacia Algarvia, foram obtidos dados U-Pb e de elementos tra\u00e7os \n\n(REE) de zirc\u00f5es e apatites atrav\u00e9s de ablas\u00e3o a laser no departamento de Geologia do Trinity \n\nCollege Dublin, Irlanda. \n\nPara os estudos de termocronologia de baixa temperatura, geocronologia e proveni\u00eancia \n\nsedimentar, foram recolhidos um total de cinquenta e cinco amostras de rochas de \n\nafloramentos da Ossa Morena, Zona Sul Portuguesa e da Bacia Algarvia. Outras doze \n\n\n\n\u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve \nBasin (South Portugal)\u201d\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 9\t\n \u00a0\n\namostras foram recolhidas de dois furos de prospec\u00e7\u00e3o mineira localizados na Zona Sul \n\nPortuguesa.  \n\nNo que se refere \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria t\u00e9rmica, as paleotemperaturas calculadas a partir da reflect\u00e2ncia da \n\nvitrinite para as amostras do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo, situam-se entre os 236 e os \n\n326\u00baC. A paleotemperatura mais elevada (414\u00baC) desta unidade foi registada no contacto com \n\nComplexo Alcalino intrusivo de Monchique. As idades de tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o indicaram que o \n\nteor em Cl das apatites mostrou ter uma forte influ\u00eancia sobre as idades obtidas.  Todas as \n\namostras do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo sofreram o \u201creset\u201d ap\u00f3s a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\napresentando idades Cret\u00e1cicas (111-59,9 Ma) e uma \u00fanica idade do Jur\u00e1ssico superior \n\n(amostra OL1-157,9 Ma). As idades dos tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o das amostras recolhidas em litologias \n\nda Zona Ossa Morena e da Zona Sul Portuguesa indicam que exuma\u00e7\u00e3o deve ter ocorrido \n\ncomo um bloco cont\u00edguo nestas duas zonas tectonoestratigr\u00e1ficas. Atrav\u00e9s da modela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nt\u00e9rmica foi poss\u00edvel constatar que as amostras da Zona Ossa Morena (Pias1 e PL1) \n\napresentam um arrefecimento lento a moderado at\u00e9 aos 240 Ma, seguindo-se um \n\narrefecimento r\u00e1pido durante o Tri\u00e1sico at\u00e9 aproximadamente \u00e0 temperatura de reten\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nparcial da apatite aos 200 Ma. Uma \u00faltima fase de arrefecimento gradual iniciou-se no granito \n\nPias aos 65 Ma at\u00e9 que fosse atingida uma temperatura superficial. A taxa de exuma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nestimada para o granito de Pias \u00e9 de 30 m/Ma desde os 65 Ma at\u00e9 ao presente. Na amostra do \n\ngranito de El Pedroso, a \u00faltima fase de arrefecimento iniciou-se \u00e0s 35 Ma. Desde ent\u00e3o at\u00e9 o \n\npresente foi inferida uma taxa de exuma\u00e7\u00e3o de 65m/Ma.  \n\nA modela\u00e7\u00e3o inversa efetuada na amostra (????) da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de M\u00e9rtola do Grupo do Flysch \n\ndo Baixo Alentejo da Zona Sul Portuguesa, apresenta um epis\u00f3dio de aquecimento ap\u00f3s a \n\nsubsid\u00eancia que se encontra relacionado com a ultima fase da tect\u00f3nica Varisca. Depois de ter \n\nsido atingida a temperatura m\u00e1xima de 300\u00b0C aos 320 Ma, a amostra arrefeceu at\u00e9 uma \n\ntemperatura de 150 \u00b0C aos 260 Ma. Dos 260 Ma at\u00e9 aos 20 Ma, a amostra permaneceu na \n\nzona de reten\u00e7\u00e3o parcial da apatite. Esse longo per\u00edodo a uma temperatura constante pode \n\nestar relacionado a uma poss\u00edvel re-subsid\u00eancia associada \u00e0 deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos \n\nmesoz\u00f3icos da Bacia do Algarve, pois a amostra localiza-se pr\u00f3ximo do contacto entre estas \n\nduas unidades geol\u00f3gicas. Dos 20 Ma at\u00e9 \u00e0 atualidade pode ser inferida uma taxa de \n\nexuma\u00e7\u00e3o de 75m/Ma  \n\nNa Bacia do Algarve os valores poder refletor da vitrinite medidos para as unidades do \n\nTri\u00e1sico situam-se entre os 1-1,1%Rr, correspondendo a paleotemperaturas entre os 148 e \n\n158\u00baC.  No caso das litologias do Cret\u00e1cico inferior (0,6%Rr), na parte ocidental da Bacia do \n\n\n\n\u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve \nBasin (South Portugal)\u201d\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 10\t\n \u00a0\n\nAlgarve, as paleotemperaturas m\u00e1ximas n\u00e3o foram suficientes para fazer o reset do sistema de \n\ntra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o da apatite. No entanto, as amostras recolhidas na Praia da Luz, perto do \n\ncontato com a intrus\u00e3o b\u00e1sica da Ponta das Ferrarias, indicam que o efeito t\u00e9rmico desta \n\nintrus\u00e3o \u00e9 intenso mas restrito a uma dist\u00e2ncia m\u00e1xima de cerca de 2 km do contato com o \n\ncorpo magm\u00e1tico intrusivo. A modela\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica realizada para as margas do Cret\u00e1cico \n\nInferior em contacto e para diferente dist\u00e2ncias da intrus\u00e3o, sugere uma temperatura m\u00e1xima \n\nde 275\u00baC alcan\u00e7ada pelas amostras mais perto do contacto intrusivo e que estas arrefeceram \n\npara uma temperatura ca. 100\u00baC em apenas 10 000 anos. \n\nAs idades de tra\u00e7os de fiss\u00e3o da apatite obtidas nas amostras de arenitos do Tri\u00e1sico Superior \n\nda Bacia Algarvia, s\u00e3o mais antigas do que a idade de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o, o que significa que as \n\namostras n\u00e3o sofreram o reset total. Assim, a anomalia t\u00e9rmica criado pela intrus\u00e3o Complexo \n\nAlcalino de Monchique foi muito circunscrita a uma zona perto do contato n\u00e3o afetando \n\nsignificativamente os processos t\u00e9rmicos de matura\u00e7\u00e3o regional da Bacia do Algarve. No \n\nentanto, os efeitos t\u00e9rmicos de pequenas intrus\u00f5es relacionadas com o Complexo Alcalino de \n\nMonchique na Bacia do Algarve n\u00e3o poder\u00e3o ser totalmente negligenciados.  \n\nAtrav\u00e9s da modela\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica do Complexo Alcalino de Monchique foi poss\u00edvel verificar que \n\neste arrefeceu rapidamente desde temperaturas magm\u00e1ticas (> 600\u00baC) para cerca de 70\u00b0C, \n\ntemperatura das rochas encaixantes no momento da intrus\u00e3o, num curto espa\u00e7o de tempo (3 \n\nMa). Se considerarmos um gradiente geot\u00e9rmico normal, o Complexo Alcalino de Monchique \n\ndever\u00e1 ter-se instalado a cerca de 2 km de profundidade. Desde os 69 aos 5 Ma o CAM \n\npermaneceu a uma temperatura constante pr\u00f3ximo da temperatura de reten\u00e7\u00e3o parcial da \n\napatite. Dos 5 Ma at\u00e9 \u00e0 atualidade as amostras arrefeceram desde os 50\u00baC at\u00e9 \u00e0 temperatura \n\nsuperficial, podendo ser inferida uma taxa de exuma\u00e7\u00e3o de 0,3km/Ma dos 5 Ma at\u00e9 ao \n\npresente. \n\nA geocronologia de zirc\u00f5es e apatites detr\u00edticas, bem como o conte\u00fado em elementos Terras \n\nRaras das apatites, permitiram inferir sobre a sua origem sedimentar. Verificou-se que os \n\nespectros de idades U-Pb de zirc\u00f5es detr\u00edticos e tamb\u00e9m as idades 207Pb corrigidas do Grupo \n\ndo Flysch do Baixo Alentejo apresentaram diferen\u00e7as significativas entre as forma\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nM\u00e9rtola/Mira e da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Brejeira. Mais concretamente, os espectros de idades U-Pb dos \n\nzirc\u00f5es detrit\u00edcos das forma\u00e7\u00f5es de M\u00e9rtola e Mira indicam ambas uma proveni\u00eancia \n\nextrabasinal (Zona Ossa-Morena) e intrabasinal (Zona Sul Portuguesa).

Detrital zircon ages were also studied in order to \n\nconstrain the sedimentary source regions and basin fill history of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch \n\nGroup from South Portuguese Zone and the Upper Triassic sandstones from the Algarve \n\nBasin. The maximum temperature attained in the South Portuguese Zone was 326 \u00baC and \n\noccurred at 320 Ma. All the samples from the South Portuguese Zone have been totally reset \n\nafter deposition and yield apatite fission track ages ranging from the Cretaceous (111 to 59.9 \n\nMa) to the Upper Jurassic (157.9 Ma). The fission track ages from the Upper Triassic \n\nsandstone did not reset after de deposition, however, the intrusion of the Monchique Alkaline \n\nComplex (MAC) and related swarm of dikes had local influence upon organic maturation. \n\nInverse modelling on apatite samples from the MAC indicate that it cooled very fast from \n\ninitial magmatic temperatures to around 70\u00baC. The rock sample studied stayed at a constant \n\ntemperature close to the top of the apatite partial annealing zone from 68.7 Ma to 5 Ma. Since \n\n5 Ma until the present the MAC underwent an exhumation of ca. 300 m/Ma.  \n\nThe U-Pb detrital zircon and apatite ages from the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations suggest \n\nsedimentary provenance areas from a detrital intrabasinal source (South Portuguese Zone) and \n\nfrom areas associated with the magmatic arc related rocks located at the southern border of \n\nthe Ossa Morena Zone. The U-Pb detrital zircon ages obtained for the Brejeira Formation \n\nsuggest a source area related to the Avalonian/Meguma terranes and also from recycled \n\nclastic sediments associated to the South Portuguese Domain. The ages from the Algarve \n\nBasin Upper Triassic sandstones suggest that they are derived from multiple sources terranes \n\nwith Permian zircons ages more abundant in the samples located in the eastern part of the \n\nbasin.  \n\nKey-Words: South Portuguese Zone, Algarve Basin, Apatite Fission tracks, vitrinite \n\nreflectance, (U-Th)/He datations, detrital zircons, sedimentary provenance. \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER I-INTRODUCTION \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South \nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 13\t\n \u00a0\n\nI - INTRODUCTION \n \n\nLow-temperature thermochronology is widely used to determine the cooling histories of \n\ncrustal rocks and to constrain the timing and rates of exhumation processes. Information on \n\nthe maximum temperature reached by a sedimentary rock can be obtained from vitrinite \n\nreflectance that is the most reliable indicator of thermal maturation in sedimentary rocks, as \n\nthe chemical reactions which control the increase of reflectance in vitrinite are irreversible. \n\nTherefore, vitrinite reflectance can be considered as a non-retrogressive \n\npalaeogeothermometer for diagenetic and low-grade metamorphic conditions. Despite the \n\nlarge amount of research that has been undertaken on the South Portuguese Zone and the \n\nAlgarve Basin, the thermal history is not well constrained. The timing and duration of burial \n\nand cooling events is still unknown or misunderstood. Combining low-temperature \n\nthermochronometers and vitinite reflectance will allow the identification and characterisation \n\nof the major episodes of heating and cooling which have affected the Variscan basement of \n\nthe South Portuguese Zone, in particular the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group, and the Meso-\n\nCenozoic sedimentary sequences of the Algarve Basin. \n\n \n\nThe sedimentary provenance of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group from South Portuguese \n\nZone and from the basal unit of the Algarve Basin, namely the Upper Triassic Silves \n\nSandstones, remains shrouded in controversy. The detrital record of sedimentary basins that \n\noccur adjacent to tectonic terranes with distinct tectono-thermal histories can be used to \n\ndiscriminate their original source area(s). For instance, the U\u2013Pb ages of individual detrital \n\nzircon and apatite grains are commonly used in sedimentary provenance analysis providing a \n\nreliable guide to the ages of basement source and can be integrated with other techniques such \n\nas petrographic studies and geochemical data. In this way, several samples were dated by the \n\nU-Pb detrital zircon and apatite method in the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group and in the \n\nAlgarve Basin to better constrain its sedimentary sources.    \n\n \n\nThis research had a duration of 48 months and was supported by the Foundation of Science \n\nand Technology (FCT) through a PhD Grant (reference number SFRH/BD/62213/2009). \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER I-INTRODUCTION \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South \nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 14\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n1.1 OBJECTIVES  \n \n\nThe propose objectives of this research project are: \n\n- Assess the maximum palaeotemperatures attained by the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group of \n\nSouth Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin using vitrinite reflectance (VR); \n\n- Establish the timing and duration of cooling after peak metamorphism by using multiple \n\nlow-temperature thermochronological techniques;  \n\n- Infer the magnitude and timing of crustal exhumation based on vitrinite reflectance and low \n\ntemperature thermochronometry; \n\n- Integrate these data (vitrinite reflectance and low temperature thermochronometry) to \n\nreconstruct the burial and exhumations histories of Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group of South \n\nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin; \n\n- Use these results to assess the potential of offshore petroleum systems in terms of the timing \n\nof source organic maturation and tectonic history of potential reservoirs; \n\n- Investigate the influence of apatite mineral composition on fission track and (U-Th)/He data \n\nand to integrate these techniques with VR data; \n\n-Investigate the REE apatite composition as a provenance host rock indicator;  \n\n-Investigate the provenance of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group and the Upper Triassic Silves \n\nSandstones from the Algarve Basin based on their U-Pb detrital zircon and apatite age \n\nspectra. \n\n1.2 METHODOLOGY  \n \n\nA detailed description of the analytical methods employed in this study will be described in \n\neach respective chapter. As it was impossible to prepare and analyse all the samples in the \n\nsame research institution, it was necessary accomplish the tasks in different locations. The \n\nsample preparation for organic maturation analyses was fully processed in the laboratory \n\nfacilities of University of the Algarve (UAlg). The heavy mineral separation was undertaken \n\nat the University of the Algarve (UAlg), at the Departamento de Geologia da Faculdade de \n\nCi\u00eancias of Lisbon University (DG/FCUL) and at the Department of Geology, Trinity College \n\nDublin. All the fission track and U-Pb measurements were undertaken at the Department of \n\nGeology, Trinity College Dublin. The (U-Th)/He analyses were performed in the laboratories \n\nof the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC), in Glasgow. \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER I-INTRODUCTION \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South \nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 15\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n1.3 THESIS STRUCTURE \n \n\nThis thesis is structured in the following way: \n\nChapter I presents an introduction to the thesis including its objectives and its structure. \n\nIn chapter II the regional geological setting of the study region is presented along with a \n\nsummary of previous research.  In this chapter the sampling strategy is also presented.  \n\nThe main techniques used in this research (vitrinite reflectance, thermochronology (apatite \n\nfission track and (U-Th)/He) and geochronology (detrital zircon and apatite U-Pb) are \n\ndescribed in chapter III. \n\nIn chapter IV the methodology used for maturation studies and the results of vitrinite \n\nreflectance measurements are presented and discussed.  \n\nThe apatite fission track methodology and respectively results are presented and discussed in \n\nchapter V. The following chapter (chapter VI) will be dedicated to the apatite (U-Th)/He \n\ndating and its interpretation (taking into account the results obtained in chapter V). \n\nIn chapter VII the detrital zircon and apatite U-Pb ages are presented. The detrital zircon and \n\napatite ages will be used as provenance indicators and discussed in the context of the \n\ngeodynamic evolution of the South Portuguese Zone and the development of the Algarve \n\nBasin. \n\nBased on the results obtained in the previous chapters some of the data were modelled using \n\nforward and inverse modelling approaches. The results of the modelling are described and \n\ndiscussed in chapter VIII. When possible, this study combines apatite fission track analysis \n\nand apatite (U-Th)/He dating to construct temperature-time paths for the South Portuguese \n\nZone and the Algarve Basin.  \n\nIn chapter IX is presented the apatite REE compositions and its use as provenance indicator is \n\ndiscussed.  \n\nChapter X is dedicated to the conclusions of this research project.  \n\n1.4 SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS \n \nDuring this PhD, the results were published in peer review journals and in congress abstracts. \n\nA short publications list is provided below.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER I-INTRODUCTION \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South \nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 16\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n1.4.1 Publications in peer review journals (annex I) \n \n\n\u2022 Rodrigues, B., Chew, D., Jorge, R.C.G.S., Fernandes, P, Oliveira, J.T.

The following section \n\nbriefly describes the geological evolution of the sampling localities. \n\n \n\n                  \nFigure  2.1 Geographic location of the studied area. The inlet boxes show the location of the geologic maps in \nfigures 2.2 (A), 2.3 (B) and 2.4 (C).  \n\n2.1.1 Ossa Morena Zone  \n \nThe Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) is one of the major tectonostratigraphic units of the Iberian \n\nVariscan Belt. It is composed of folded, thrusted and metamorphosed rocks of Precambrian \n\nand Palaeozoic age and abundant intrusive bodies emplaced before and during the Variscan \n\norogenic cycle (Antunes, 2006). \n\n \n\nIn the Portuguese part of the Ossa Morena Zone several sectors with distinct stratigraphy and \n\nstructure have been identified and these have been subdivided into different \n\ntectonostratigraphic units, also termed \u201csectors\u201d or \u201cdomains\u201d (Carvalho et al., 1971; Delgado  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 19\t\n \u00a0\n\net al., 1977; Apalategui et al., 1990; Oliveira et al., 1991). They are from north to south: \n\nBlastomylonitic Belt Sector; Alter do Ch\u00e3o-Elvas Sector; Estremoz-Barrancos Sector; \n\nMontemor-Ficalho Sector; \u00c9vora Massif; Beja Igneous Complex and the Beja Acebuches \n\nOphiolite complex. The Blastomylonitic Belt Sector in the north and the Beja Acebuches \n\nOphiolite complex at the south of the Ossa Morena Zone are considered to be two orogenic \n\nsutures and thus the limits of the Ossa Morena Zone are defined based on the presence of \n\nbasic igneous rocks with oceanic affinities (Azor, 2004; P\u00e9rez-Esta\u00fan et al., 2004). The Ossa \n\nMorena Zone is not the main subject of this study and a reader is advised to consult the \n\nreferenced authors for more detailed information.  \n\nRegarding the evolution of the OMZ, it commenced with the erosion of the Cadomian chain \n\nin late Proterozoic times, when a large Lower Cambrian carbonate platform built up over a \n\nlarge area (Oliveira et al., 1991). Extensional tectonism during the Marianian (Lower \n\nCambrian) generated tholeitic basic volcanics and several sedimentary depocenters, which \n\nwere rapidly filled up with sediments during a Middle Cambrian marine regression. During \n\nthe Middle Cambrian, a renewed pulse of extensional tectonism led to the development of \n\nsedimentary basins that filled up with terrigenous sediments, alkaline basalts and minor \n\nperalkaline volcanics. Tectonic blocks generated during this extensional phase were rotated \n\nand uplifted leading to the karstification of the Lower Cambrian carbonates (Oliveira et al., \n\n1991). The Ordovician sedimentary rocks are usually terrigenous and fine grained with \n\ninterbedded alkaline basalts and rest unconformably on the Middle Cambrian sediments, \n\nindicating an upper Cambrian depositional hiatus (Oliveira et al., 1991). At the top of the \n\nOrdovician sediments occurs an extensive shallow water sandstone unit, which is associated \n\nwith a polygenic conglomerate. In early Devonian times sedimentation was dominated by \n\nshallow-water terrigenous and carbonate sediments. During the Middle Devonian, uplift of \n\nthe OMZ took place as a consequence of subduction to the south.  The Late Devonian and \n\nEarly Carboniferous were marked by oblique collision between the OMZ and the South \n\nPortuguese Zone, characterized by obduction in the SE and subduction in the NW (Oliveira et \n\nal., 1991). \n\nMagmatic activity related to the Variscan orogenic cycle is represented by volcanic and \n\nplutonic rocks with ages clustered in the age interval 345-280 Ma (e.g. Pinto, 1987; S\u00e1nchez-\n\nCarretero et al., 1990; Dunning et al., 2002; Salman, 2004). According to their relationships \n\nwith respect to the main Variscan tectonic events, the Variscan granitoids are generally \n\nsubdivided into two groups: syn-tectonic and late/post-tectonic (Antunes, 2006).  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 20\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.1.2 South Portuguese Zone \n \nThe northern boundary of the South Portuguese Zone with the Ossa Morena Zone is defined \n\nby the Beja Acebuches Ophiolite which is interpreted as a remnant of the Rheic Ocean that \n\nseparated the Euramerican South Portuguese Zone from the Ossa Morena Zone (Oliveira \n\n1990; Quesada et al., 1994; Oliveira &amp; Quesada, 1998; Braid et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., \n\n2013a). \n\nThe South Portuguese Zone is divided into four domains (Oliveira, 1990; Ribeiro et al., \n\n1990), which are from NE to SW, the Pulo do Lobo Antiform, the Pyrite Belt, the Baixo \n\nAltentejo Flysch Group and the Southwest Portugal Domain (Fig. 2.2).  \n\nThe Pulo do Lobo Antiform has been interpreted as representing an exhumed suture zone or \n\naccretionary prism that records the final stages of the closure of the Rheic Ocean and the \n\nterminal collision between Gondwana and Laurussia (e.g. Eden, 1991; On\u00e9zime et al. 2003; \n\nOliveira et al., 2013b). The Pulo do Lobo Formation crops out in the core of the Pulo do Lobo \n\nAntiform and consists of highly deformed phyllites and quartzites with intercalations of \n\namphibolites of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) affinity in the lower parts of the sequence \n\n(Munh\u00e1, 1983). U-Pb detrital zircon data from the quartzites suggest a maximum depositional \n\nage of 438 Ma (Silurian) for this formation (Braid et al., 2011). Flysch-type successions crop \n\nout on the northern and southern flanks of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform. These rocks are dated \n\nby palynomorphs as Frasnian to late Famennian in age (Pereira et al., 2006, 2008).  \n\nThe Iberian Pyrite Belt succession consists of phyllites and quartzites of the Phyllite Quartzite \n\nGroup overlain by volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex \n\n(Oliveira, 1990). Palynomorphs in the uppermost part of the Phyllite Quartzite Group indicate \n\na Late Devonian (Strunian) age (Pereira et al., 2008). The Iberian Pyrite Belt volcanism \n\nresulted from a local phase of extensional tectonism and is bi-modal in composition with the \n\nfelsic component dominant (Munh\u00e1, 1983, 1990; Mitjavila et al., 1997). The Iberian Pyrite \n\nBelt rocks are dated as Late Devonian to late Vis\u00e9an (382.7-330 Ma) based on palynomorphs \n\nand rare conodont assemblages (Boogaard, 1963, 1967; Oliveira et al., 2004; Pereira et al., \n\n2007, 2008). Zircons extracted from felsic volcanic rocks yield U-Pb ages ranging from 349 \n\nto 385 Ma (Nesbit et al., 1999; Barrie et al., 2002; Dunning et al., 2002; Rosa et al., 2009; \n\nOliveira et al., 2013a).  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 21\t\n \u00a0\n\nThe Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group represents the development of a foreland basin that formed \n\nas a result of an oblique collision between the South Portuguese Zone and the Ossa Morena \n\nZone, with associated tectonic stacking that propagated from the NE to SW (Oliveira et al., \n\n1979; Oliveira, 1990; Silva et al., 1990; Pereira, 1997, 1999). The Baixo Alentejo Flysch \n\nGroup comprises three formations that are, from oldest to youngest, the M\u00e9rtola, Mira and \n\nBrejeira formations (Fig. 2.2). These units are dated as late Vis\u00e9an (345-326 Ma), \n\nSerpukhovian to early Bashkirian (326-315 Ma), and late Bashkirian to late Moscovian (315-\n\n307 Ma) respectively (Oliveira et al., 1979; Korn, 1997; Pereira, 1999; Pereira et al., 2006, \n\n2008). The M\u00e9rtola Formation comprises beds of greywacke of variable thickness \n\ninterbedded with shales, siltstones, conglomerates and rare mudflows, with the greywacke \n\nbeds exhibiting sedimentary structures typical of turbidites (Oliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis, \n\n1983). The average modal composition of greywackes from the M\u00e9rtola Formation is \n\nQt46.2F26.9L26.19, where Qt is the modal abundance of quartz, F is the modal abundance of \n\nfeldspar and L is the sum of all lithic fragments (Jorge et al., 2013). The Mira Formation is \n\ncomprised of greywackes interbedded with shales and rare conglomerates (Oliveira et al., \n\n1979). The average modal composition of the greywackes from the Mira Formation is \n\nQt61.7F7.6L30.7 (Jorge et al., 2013). The overlying Brejeira Formation is divided into two \n\ndistinct belts that were recognized during regional geological mapping (Oliveira et al., 1979; \n\nOliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983).  The basal beds consist of quartzites and quartz-wackes \n\ninterbedded with shales while the younger belt consists of immature greywackes interbedded \n\nwith shales. The average modal composition of greywackes from the Brejeira Formation is \n\nQt83.1F6.7L10.1. Abundant quartz grains are rounded to sub-rounded and well sorted (Jorge et \n\nal., 2013). The clastic lithologies in this formation contain abundant clasts of sedimentary \n\nrocks and metamorphic quartz but are poor in volcanic fragments (Oliveira &amp; Wagner \n\nGenthis, 1983; Jorge et al., 2013). The Mira and Brejeira formations are interpreted as the \n\nresult of progressive progradation of turbiditic sedimentation towards the SW (Oliveira &amp; \n\nWagner Genthis, 1983; Oliveira, 1990). \n\nThe Southwest Portugal Domain succession comprises Late Devonian quartzites and shales of \n\nthe Tercenas Formation followed by a mud-dominated carbonate platform sequence of the \n\nCarrapateira Group which ranges in age from the Tournaisian to the late Bashkirian (358.9-\n\n315.2 Ma) (Pereira, 1999). A recent U-Pb detrital zircon study from the Tercenas Formation \n\nquartzites confirms a maximum depositional age of Late Devonian (367\u00b16.4 Ma) for this \n\nformation (Pereira et al., 2012). \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 22\t\n \u00a0\n\nLate Palaeozoic palaeotectonic reconstructions suggest that the South Portuguese Zone was \n\npart of the Avalonia Plate (e.g., Martinez-Catal\u00e1n et al., 1997; Oliveira &amp; Quesada, 1998; la \n\nRosa et al., 2002; Von Raumer et al., 2003; Ribeiro et al., 2007; Jorge, 2009; Jorge et al., \n\n2013).  The collision of this plate with the margin of the Ossa Morena Zone (an outboard part \n\nof Gondwanan Iberia) in early Visean times led to the cessation of volcanism in the Iberian \n\nPyrite Belt and a phase of tectonic inversion, resulting in a pulse of rapid uplift on the \n\nsouthwest border of the Ossa Morena Zone and the development of a SW-prograding trough \n\non the Avalonian margin (Oliveira &amp; Quesada, 1998; Jorge et al., 2013).  \n\nThe angular unconformity between the South Portuguese Zone and the Algarve basin marks \n\nthe southern boundary of South Portuguese Zone.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 23\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\nFi\ngu\n\nre\n 2\n\n.2\n S\n\nim\npl\n\nif\nie\n\nd \nge\n\nol\nog\n\nic\n m\n\nap\n o\n\nf \nth\n\ne \nM\n\non\nch\n\niq\nue\n\n A\nlk\n\nal\nin\n\ne \nC\n\nom\npl\n\nex\n (\n\nad\nap\n\nte\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n V\nal\n\nad\nar\n\nes\n, 2\n\n00\n4)\n\n w\nith\n\n s\nam\n\npl\ne \n\nlo\nca\n\ntio\nns\n\n m\nar\n\nke\nd.\n\n I\nt c\n\nor\nre\n\nsp\non\n\nds\n to\n\n th\ne \n\nin\nse\n\nt A\n in\n\n \nfi\n\ngu\nre\n\n 2\n.1\n\n.  \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 24\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.1.3 Permian Viar Basin \n \nThe Viar Basin is an elongate basin that strikes NW-SE and crops in the Sierra Norte of the \n\nSeville province (fig. 2.1B and fig. 2.3). Is an intra-orogenic half-graben located between the \n\nSouth Portuguese Zone and the Ossa Morena Zone (Sierra et al, 2009). The Permian Viar \n\nBasin is a result of various extensional\u2013compressive tectonic episodes that occurred along the \n\nthe South Portuguese Zone-Ossa Morena Zone boundary during the final stages of the \n\nVariscan Orogeny (Simancas, 1983; Garc\u00eda-Navarro &amp; Sierra, 1998). This is the \n\nsouthernmost occurrence of Permian strata in Iberian (Wagner &amp; Mayoral, 2007). The Viar \n\nBasin consists of conglomerates, sandstones and lutites with minor intercalated limestone, \n\nmafic and felsic volcanic rocks (Sierra et al., 2000). Sedimentation started with fluvial \n\nconglomerates and sandstones with a sedimentary provenance mainly from the Ossa Morena \n\nZone (Wagner &amp; Mayoral, 2007; Sierra et al, 1999) The sedimentations had stopped due to \n\nvolcanic activity that fill up the paleotopography  (Wagner &amp; Mayoral, 2007; Sierra et al, \n\n1999). However, the location of the volcanic vent is difficult to ascertain, probably as a result \n\nof later compressive deformation (Sierra et al, 1999).   \n\n         \n\nFigure 2.3 Simplified geologic of Permian Viar Basin with the sample location (adapted from Sierra, 2009). It \ncorresponds to the inlet B in figure 2.1. \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 25\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.1.4 Algarve Basin \n \nThe Algarve Basin is the southernmost geological province of mainland Portugal and \n\nunconformably overlies the South Portuguese Zone. The basin strikes E-W and crops out \n\nonshore from Cap S\u00e3o Vicente to the Portuguese-Spanish border (Fig. 2.1 and 2.2). More than \n\n3 km of mostly marine sediments accumulated during Mesozoic-Cenozoic times \n\n(Mannuepella, 1992). The Mesozoic strata accumulated on a passive margin that formed \n\nduring successive extensional phases from the Late Triassic to the Middle Cretaceous related \n\nto the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean (Mannupella et al., 1988).  \n\nSedimentation in the Algarve Basin was initiated in Late Triassic times with the deposition of \n\ncontinental red beds and evaporites, which unconformably overlie folded and faulted \n\nCarboniferous strata (Palain, 1976). The red bed succession consists of sandstones  and \n\nconglomerates at the base (Silves sandstones), overlain by variated mudstones interbedded \n\nwith siltstones and dolomites. On top of these strata, to the south of the E-W trending Algibre \n\nFault, there are thick evaporitic deposits, whereas north of this major structure, the evaporites \n\nare virtually absent. These strata are overlain by volcanic rocks associated with the Central \n\nAtlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) (Martins et al., 2008; Verati et al., 2007). The Lower \n\nJurassic Algarve CAMP magmatism was dated by the 40Ar/39Ar method at 198.1\u00b11.6 to 198.4 \n\n\u00b1 2.8 Ma (Verati et al., 2007). It consists of subaerial lava flows, peperites and pyroclastic \n\ndeposits, and contemporaneous resedimented volcanic material (Martins et al., 2008). Some \n\nsedimentary layers are interbedded with effusive and explosive volcanic products which are \n\nindicative of coeval volcanism and sedimentation (Martins et al., 2008). The CAMP mark the \n\nend of the first phase of rifting in the Algarve Basin. After this important magmatic episode, \n\nmarine carbonate sedimentation became well-established across the Algarve Basin between \n\nthe Sinemurian to Tithonian (199-145 Ma).  During this interval, lateral facies changes in the \n\nlimestone facies across the basin allow its division into the Western (Sagres), the Budens-\n\nLagoa, and the Eastern (Faro) sub-basins (Mannupella et al., 1988). These small sub-basins \n\nare separated by major north-south trending faults, which were probably active during \n\ndeposition. Three main sedimentary cycles separated by regional unconformities related either \n\nto global sea level variations or to regional tectonic events (Mouterde, 1971; Mannupella et \n\nal., 1988; Terrinha et al., 2002) are recognized in the Jurassic marine carbonates of the \n\nAlgarve Basin. There is evidence of extensional tectonism associated with four rifting phases \n\nwhich are in turn associated with four mega-sedimentary cycles: three in the Jurassic (Lower, \n\nMedium and Upper) and one in the Lower Cretaceous (Mannupela et al., 1988). The main \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 26\t\n \u00a0\n\ncarbonate lithologies found in the Algarve Basin are shallow water limestones, sometimes \n\nwith coral and sponge bioherms, pelagic limestones marls, bioherms and dolomites (e.g. \n\nManuppella et al., 1988; Oliveira, 1992).  \n\nThe Lower Cretaceous sedimentary interval is represented by a mixed carbonate and \n\nsiliciclastic succession (Rey, 2006) which attains its maximum thickness (ca. 1500 m) in the \n\ncentral Algarve. The basal units consists of marls and dolomites that rest conformably on \n\nUpper Jurassic limestones. These are followed by marls, dolomites, sandstones and \n\nmudstones that were deposited in nearshore and continental settings. During the Aptian to \n\nAlbian interval (125-101 Ma), depositional conditions become more uniform across the basin, \n\nresulting in the accumulation of variated muds of possible lagoonal origin (the Aptian Luz \n\nMarls). \n\nMiocene strata were deposited unconformably over the Mesozoic sequences in sedimentary \n\nbasins controlled by Alpine tectonics. The main phase of inversion of the Mesozoic strata \n\noccurred during Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic times (Kullberg et al., 1992, Terrinha, 1998), \n\nsynchronous with igneous activity associated with the Monchique Alkaline Complex. \n\nAlthough the main batholith of the Monchique Alkaline Complex intrudes only greywackes \n\nand shales of the Brejeira formation, minor intrusions related to the Monchique Syenite dyke \n\nswarm intrude the Algarve Basin succession, especially in the Western Sub-Basin \n\n(Manuppela et al., 1998) as in the case of the Ponta das Ferrarias Intrusion near Lagos \n\n(Henriques, 1954). Plio-Quaternary clastic deposits unconformably overlie the Palaeozoic, \n\nMesozoic and Miocene strata, and exhibit sedimentary facies consistent with eustatic sea-\n\nlevel changes related to Late Cenozoic climatic fluctuations (Moura, 1998).  \n\n2.1.5 Monchique Alkaline Complex \n\n  \nThe Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) is located in South Portugal and was intruded into \n\nthe shales and greywackes of the Brejeira Formation (Fig. 2.1C and 2.4). The MAC shows a \n\nsub-elliptical shape of nearly 80 km2 and defines two main hills: Foia (902 m) in the western \n\npart and Picota (773 m) in the eastern part. The host rocks are truncated by the intrusive \n\ncomplex, except in the western and eastern extremes where the regional structure of the host \n\nrock is sub-parallel to the contact with the MAC (Valadares, 2004).  \n\nThe MAC is composed by multiple intrusions of nepheline syenite, intermediate and \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 27\t\n \u00a0\n\nultrabasic rocks and several brecciated formations (Valadares, 2004). The MAC has been \n\ndated by several methods giving a Late Cretaceous age of ca. 72 Ma: (K-Ar 72\u00b12 Ma- \n\nMacIntyre &amp; Berger, 1982; Rb-Sr 72\u00b11.5 Ma-Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997, 72\u00b12 Ma-Rock, \n\n1978; Amphibole 72.7\u00b12.7 Ma-Miranda et al., 2009; Whole rock 71.5\u00b13.6 Ma-Miranda et al., \n\n2009).  It is part of the Iberian Alkaline Igneous Province that includes other intrusions of the \n\nsame age such as Sines and Sintra (Rock, 1982; MacIntyre &amp; Berger, 1982). The intrusion \n\nhas created a halo of contact metamorphism of a uniform thickness of 200 m, except in the \n\nnorthwest sector where it is up to 1 km wide (Valadares, 2004).   \n\n \nFig. 2.4 Simplified geologic map of the Monchique Alkaline Complex with the sample locations marked \n(adapted from Valadares, 2004). It corresponds to inset C in figure 2.1. \n \n\n2.2 PREVIOUS WORK IN THE STUDIED AREA \n\n2.2.1 Maturation studies \n \n\nSeveral maturation works have been published on the studied area, mainly on organic \n\nmaturation but also with some studies on clay crystallinity. A comprehensive study of the \n\nthermal history of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group was published by McCormack et al. \n\n(2007), determining a mean vitrinite reflectance (VR) of 4.28% Rr for this domain and \n\nsuggesting that the timing of maturation was post-Variscan deformation, within the late \n\nCarboniferous\u2013late Triassic interval due the relatively low VR values os Triassic samples (1.1 \n\n% Rr). \n\nIn the Tercenas Formation and in the Vis\u00e9an Murra\u00e7\u00e3o Formation from Southwest Portugal \n\nDomain, a few samples indicate maturation levels of ca. 3.2% Rr (McCormack, 1998; \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 28\t\n \u00a0\n\nMcCormack et al. 2007). In the Carrapateira Group, also from the Southwest Portugal \n\nDomain, the maturation levels range from 2.5-4% Rr (Mo\u00e7o et al., 1998). These values for \n\nthe Southwest Portugal Domain are lower than the mean maturation value of c. 4.83% Rr for \n\nthe younger Brejeira Formation of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group (Fernandes et al., 2012).  \n\nIn the Pyrite Belt in the S\u00e3o Domingos mine area, the VR values range from 4.6 to 5.2% Rr, \n\nindicating a meta-anthracite coal rank (Pereira et al. 2006). \n\nDiagenetic and metamorphic conditions within the South Portuguese Zone have also been \n\nstudied by means of clay mineral crystallinity (Munh\u00e1, 1983, 1990; McCormack, 1998; Abad \n\net al., 2001). These studies show a decrease in crystallinity from epizone conditions in the NE \n\nto the late diagenetic zone in the SW. Vitrinite reflectance of the organic matter from the \n\nflysch successions of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform indicates that meta- anthracite coal rank was \n\nattained post-late Devonian (Pereira et al., 2006). \n\nFernandes et al. (2012) revised the maturation values in the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group in \n\norder to better constraint the timing of maturation. There was no observal increase in VR in \n\nthe studied borehole, which did not allow a meaningful regional palaeogeothermal gradient \n\ncalculation to be made for the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group. The Baixo Altentejo Flysch \n\nGroup in general does not display any great variability in VR, with Rr ranging from 3.80 to \n\n5.55% and there is not clear any correlation between the Rr means in the three formations \n\ninvestigated. The mean peak palaeotemperatures for the M\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira \n\nformations are 311, 302 and 310 \u00b0C respectively. Fernandes et al. (2012) suggested that the \n\nattainment of peak temperatures during late Pennsylvanian times was as a consequence of \n\nsimple pre-tectonic burial in a high geothermal gradient context and that during the Variscan \n\ndeformation the temperatures remained high but did not exceed the maximum attained prior \n\nto deformation. The advective heating by hot fluids expelled during Variscan folding and \n\nthrusting produced relatively uniform high temperatures in the upper crust and may \n\noverprinted any existing vertical VR gradient. The evidence for high temperatures having \n\nbeen maintained for some time after deformation is provided by the similarity of vitrinite \n\nreflectance in Carboniferous rocks at the surface. The anomalously low maturity of platform-\n\nfacies rocks in the Aljezur\u2013Bordeira antiforms may be a consequence of this area having been \n\na \u2018sink\u2019 for descending, relatively cool fluids Fernandes et al. (2012). \n\nMore recently Fernandes et al. (2013) published a comprehensive study of the thermal history \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 29\t\n \u00a0\n\nof Algarve Basin. It was observed in the entire Algarve Basin that maturation levels increase \n\nwith the increasing age of the strata, indicating that burial was the main process controlling \n\nmaturation. The values of vitrinite reflectance range from 0.52-0.7% Rr in the Lower \n\nCretaceous to 1-1.1% Rr in the Upper Triassic Hettangian. The Miocene rocks that \n\nunconformably overlie the Mesozoic strata are immature, showing values of 0.42 and 0.47% \n\nRr. The palaeogeothermal maximum gradients in the onshore Algarve Basin range from 52 \u00ba \n\nC/km in Sagres-Lagos to 24.7 \u00baC/km in Faro area.  The author suggests that peak \n\ntemperatures of all the stratigraphic units were attained in latest Cretaceous time. Regarding \n\nthe VR values, the estimated thicknesses of cover removed is ca. 800 m in the Sagres-Lagos \n\narea and ca. 4 000 m in the Faro area suggest either continuous sedimentation in the Algarve \n\nBasin through much of the Late Cretaceous or a substantial section eroded at the base of the \n\nMiocene unconformity.  \n\n2.2.2 Low-temperature thermochronology studies \n  \n\nStapel (1999) undertook an apatite fission track study along a profile across the Algarve and \n\nSierra Morena (Spain) in order to analyse if the different geophysical characteristics of the \n\nWest and Central Iberian Regions are also expressed in its cooling history. His study covers \n\nthe South Portuguese, Ossa Morena and Central Iberian Zones. The fission track ages \n\nestablish a clear difference between the South Portuguese Zone and the Central Iberian Zone. \n\nThe South Portuguese Zone shows fission track ages and track lengths of 111.6\u00b19.83 Ma and \n\n13.81\u00b11.04\u00b5m and 113.3\u00b19.77 Ma.  The Ossa Morena Zone shows a dispersion of apatite \n\nfission track ages (55.98\u00b13.94 Ma, 69.94\u00b16.52 Ma and 113.7\u00b117.1 Ma) with a Cenozoic \n\ncomponent not present in the South Portuguese Zone.  The confined track lengths have the \n\nsame order of magnitude that in the South Portuguese zone, with values of 13.43\u00b11.17 \u00b5m  \n\nand 13.63\u00b11.14 \u00b5m in the samples with a Cenozoic age. The forward modeling results \n\nindicate that the fission track age records an actual cooling event, namely a rapid cooling \n\naround 120 Ma and an recent cooling episode related to an uplift phase from 40 Ma until \n\npresent.  \n\n \n\nValadares (2004) report apatite fission track ages from the Monchique Alkaline Complex of \n\n72.5\u00b12.8 Ma, with confined fission tracks lengths of 13.68\u00b10.22 \u00b5m. This value is coincident \n\nwith the emplacement of Monchique at ca. 72 Ma (Rock, 1978; Miranda et al, 2009). The \n\nauthors suggest several phenomena that could yield a fission track age which is identical to \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 30\t\n \u00a0\n\nthe emplacement age: (1) the intrusion occurred in low depth crust levels; (2) heat dissipation \n\nthrough convection processes; (3) convection of fluids that removed the thermal anomaly \n\nassociated with intrusion; (4) a compressive stage between the Cenomanian and Paleogene \n\nthat rapidly uplifted the Monchique Alkaline Complex through the apatite partial annealing \n\nzone. \n\n2.2.3 Previous provenance studies on the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group  \n \n\nEarly provenance studies of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group from South Portuguse Zone \n\nmostly employed palaeocurrent and petrographic analysis (Boogaard, 1967; Schermerhorn, \n\n1971; Oliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983; Moreno, 1988, 1993; Moreno &amp; S\u00e1ez, 1989). \n\nPalaeocurrent analyses from the M\u00e9rtola Formation exhibit a complex pattern with \n\npredominant flow directions from the north (Oliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983). The sparse \n\npalaeocurrent data from the Mira Formation indicate that the predominant flow directions \n\nwere towards the northwest (Oliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983). The Brejeira Formation \n\nexhibits flow directions mainly to the southeast and east with some paleocurrent \n\nmeasurements indicating flow towards the southwest and north (Oliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis, \n\n1983).  \n\nEarly petrographic analyses of the M\u00e9rtola Formation suggested that most of the lithic clasts \n\nwere derived from the Phyllite Quartzite Group and Volcano-Sedimentary Complex \n\n(Boogaard, 1967), with also a small contribution from the southwest border of the Ossa \n\nMorena Zone (Oliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983). Moreno (1988, 1993) and Moreno and \n\nS\u00e1ez (1989) infer that two coeval turbidite systems fed the M\u00e9rtola Formation derived from \n\ntwo different sources (the Ossa Morena Zone and the Pyrite Belt). However, reworked \n\nCambrian to Early Devonian palynomorphs commonly occur in the Brejeira Formation \n\n(Pereira, 1999) and indicate a source area for this stratigraphic unit from outside the South \n\nPortuguese Zone, as no rocks older than the Mid-Devonian crop out within the South \n\nPortuguese Zone. \n\nJorge et al. (2013) undertook a comprehensive major- and trace-element geochemistry study \n\non all three formations of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group. This study concluded that the \n\nsource area for the sedimentary rocks of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations was derived mainly \n\nfrom the SW border of the Ossa Morena Zone (Fig. 1).  The provenance of the youngest \n\nBrejeira Formation was suggested to be either from an internal orogenic source alone or with \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 31\t\n \u00a0\n\na contribution from an external source, possibly Avalonia. Although the second scenario was \n\nfavoured by Jorge et al. (2013), this question remains open. \n\nU-Pb detrital zircon analyses that have been undertaken on the M\u00e9rtola Formation rocks \n\nsuggest that the Iberian Pyrite Belt and the internal zones of the Ossa Morena Zone were the \n\nmain sources (Jorge, 2009; Pereira et al., 2012). However, there are presently no U-Pb detrital \n\nzircon data from the other formations of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group and the provenance \n\nand evolution of the group as a whole remains uncertain. In recent years several U-Pb zircon \n\ndating studies have been undertaken on the Ossa Morena Zone (e.g. Cordani et al., 2006), the \n\nVolcano-Sedimentary Complex of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (e.g. Rosa et al., 2009) and the \n\ndifferent domains of the South Portuguese Zone (Jorge, 2009; Braid et al., 2011; Pereira et \n\nal., 2012). In this work we present U-Pb detrital zircon data from the M\u00e9rtola, Mira and \n\nBrejeira formations of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group. The aim of this study is to compare \n\nthe U-Pb detrital zircon data with the different models proposed for the provenance of the \n\nBaixo Alentejo Flysch Group in order to further constrain the tectonic setting of this \n\nCarboniferous basin in the context of the evolution of the SW Iberian Variscides. \n\n2.3.2 Provenance studies on Upper Triassic Silves Sandstones in Algarve Basin \n \n\nIn the Algarve Basin, the siliciclastic sediments of the Upper Triassic termed the Silves \n\nSandstones (Rocha, 1976), are comprised of sandstones and conglomerates with oblique \n\nstratification and lenticular structures (Palain, 1976). These sediments were deposited in a \n\nfluvial sedimentary environment and were associated with numerous alluvial fans deposited \n\non Variscan basement (Palain, 1976). Palaeocurrents indicate a sedimentary provenance \n\nmainly from the NE to SW and is assumed that the Variscan basement was the main \n\nsedimentary source for the Silves Sandstones (Palain, 1976). The lack of isotopic ages from \n\nthe Upper Triassic makes its provenance an open question.  \n\n2.3 SAMPLING  \n \n\nSampling was carried out in three campaigns during the first year of work. The sampling \n\ncampaigns were designed to complement the existing and published thermochronology, \n\norganic maturation and provenance data. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 32\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.3.1 Organic Maturation Sampling \n \n\nA total of forty-two samples were collected from outcrops (fig. 2.2, 2.3) in the Baixo Alentejo \n\nFlysch Group, in the Algarve Basin and in the Permian Viar Basin to constrain the maximum \n\ntemperatures attained and to allow a better understanding of the thermal history (including the \n\nplanned fission tracks results) and also to increase the geographic spread of the existing \n\norganic maturity database. A total of ten samples from two mineral exploration boreholes \n\n(CST1 and CT1) located in the M\u00e9rtola Formation from South Portuguese Zone were also \n\nsampled (see point 2.3.3). The lithologies sampled were shales, mudstones and clays. Where \n\npossible, the samples were collected at localities where low-thermochronology samples were \n\ntaken (see 2.3.2). In the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group, two samples were taken from the \n\nM\u00e9rtola Formation, three from the Mira Formation and five from the Brejeira Formation \n\n(table 1, fig. 2.2). In the Permian Viar Basin, five samples were collected (table 2.1, fig. 2.4). \n\nIn the Algarve Basin four samples were collected in Lower cretaceous Sobral formation in \n\nFaro sub-basin. Other twenty-three outcrop samples were collected from the Lower \n\nCretaceous Luz Marls and Mudstones located near the ca. 150 m thick basic intrusion at \n\nPonta das Ferrarias at the eastern end of the Praia da Luz (Lagos) in the eastern Algarve sub-\n\nbasin (table 2.1, fig. 2.2). The samples were collected in the same layer, at different distances \n\nfrom the intrusion as shown in figure 2.5.  \n\n                     \nFigure 2.5 Illustration of the sampled layer and the proximity to the intrusion.

The lithologies sampled were \n\ngreywackes, quartz-greywackes, sandstones, quartzites, dolerites, granites and syenites (table \n\n2.2). The samples were collected mainly for low-temperature thermochronology studies and, \n\nwhen possible and the mineral content were adequate, were also used for U-Pb geochronology \n\nand sedimentary provenance studies. A total of twelve samples from two mineral exploration \n\nboreholes (CST1 and CT1) located in the South Portuguese Zone were also sampled (see \n\npoint 2.3.3).  \n\nThe samples were collected in order to make a \u201ctransect\u201d that covered the Ossa Morena Zone \n\nthrough the South Portuguese Zone, crossing the Monchique Alkaline Complex and into the \n\nAlgarve Basin. The \u201ctransect\u201d is not a straight line but often consists of several samples \n\ncollected from the oldest to youngest formations in a given region as shown in figure 2.2. \n\nAlthough the Ossa Morena Zone is not one of the objectives of this study, in order to control \n\nthe relative movements between the Ossa Morena Zona and the South Portuguese Zone, two \n\nsamples from Late Variscan granites (PIAS1 and LP1) and two samples from the Beja \n\nIgneous domain (CB1 and CB2) were sampled (fig. 2.2 and 2.3 and table 2.2). In the Permian \n\nViar basin two samples were collected, one from coarse tuffs (VLC4) and another from a red \n\nsandstones (VLC7).  In the Monchique Alkaline Complex three samples were collected at \n\ndifferent altitudes and from distinct units. One sample was collected from the highest point \n\n(MM2) in a central unit of nepheline syanite with intergranular texture. The other two \n\nsamples were collected from the border unit of nepheline syanite in the contact with the \n\ncountry rock (MM1) and in a quarry (MMP1) (Table 2.2, fig. 2.4).  \n\nIn an attempt to constrain the thermal history of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group prior to the \n\ndeposition of Algarve basin sediments and also to constrain the thermal history of the base \n\nunits of the Algarve Basin, several samples were collected along the angular unconformity \n\nbetween these two units. The samples were collected along the unconformity from west to \n\neast. Five samples (TL1, SL2, QR2, SC2 and CM2) are from the Upper Triassic Silves \n\nsandstones of the Algarve Basin. The other five samples are from greywackes from the \n\nBrejeira formation (TL1, BA2), the Mira Formation (QR1, SC1, CM1) and the Baixo \n\nAlentejo Flysch Group (table 2.2 and fig 2.2 and 2.6).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 35\t\n \u00a0\n\n \nFigure 2.6 Illustration of the sampling along the angular unconformity between the South Portuguese Zone and \nthe Algarve Basin.

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to give a detailed and in-depth description of \n\nthe principles behind each methodology used. However, the key references for each method \n\nare given in the follow sections. The instrumental procedures are described in the chapters \n\ncorresponding to each method.  \n\n3.1 VITRINITE REFLECTANCE  \n \n\nThe term vitrinite was first proposed as a maceral group by Stopes (1935). In incident light \n\nmicroscopy the organic matter components, macerals, are identified on the basis of their \n\noptical properties. They are very common in coals and are also found in sedimentary rocks as \n\ndispersed organic matter. Macerals are microscopic organic entities derived from terrestrial, \n\nlacustrine and marine plant remains and are modified by deposition processes, early \n\ndiagenesis and subsequent thermal evolution (Su\u00e1rez-Ruiz et al., 2012). There are three \n\nmaceral groups: huminite/vitrinite, liptinite and inertinite. In this chapter only vitrinite will be \n\ndiscussed. Vitrinite can be defined chemically as an organic compound formed by \n\npolyaromatic nuclei, heteroatomic ketone and carboxyl groups which are surrounded by \n\nperipheral aliphatic chains. The exact proprieties of vitrinite depend on their origin, namely if \n\nit is derived from lignin or cellulose, or a combination of both. The amount of biodegradation \n\nthat occurs during the early stages of organic diagenesis is also important (Fermont, 1988). \n\nThe initial chemical composition of the botanical vitrinite percursors and the amount of initial \n\nbiodegradation are important and influence the vitrinite reflectance. The reflectance increase \n\nobserved in vitrinite is intrinsically related to the chemical changes that occur in its structure \n\nduring coalification. The chemical structure of vitrinite can be represented by several \n\n\u201cclusters\u201d of condensed aromatic rings linked with chains and stacked on top of one another. \n\nWith increasing maturity, these \u201cclusters\u201d fuse together into larger, condensed aromatic ring \n\nstructures. Eventually, they form sheets of condensed rings that assume an orderly structure. \n\nBoth the increases in the size of these sheets and their preferred orientation cause greater \n\nreflectivity (Stachs et al., 1982). Other chemical changes that occur during coalification \n\ninclude the increase in the carbon content of vitrinite and a progressive decrease in the oxygen \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER III- FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED TECHNICS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 39\t\n \u00a0\n\nand hydrogen content. The chemical reactions as vitrinite undergoes increasing maturation are \n\nalso responsible for the anisotropy observed at higher ranks.  \n\nTemperature is considered to be the principal factor that controls the increase of vitrinite \n\nreflectance, although other factors do have some effects, like stress, time and pressure \n\n(Murchinson et al., 1985). Chemical reactions which affect vitrinite particles during organic \n\nmaturation are irreversible and their reaction rates rise exponentially with a linear rise in \n\ntemperature. Consequently, the increase in the magnitude of vitrinite reflectance also \n\nincreases exponentially with a linear rise in temperature.   \n\nCook (1991) compiled some of the main distinguishing features of vitrinite from other \n\nmaceral groups. One of these features is primarily based on its morphology. In sections \n\nperpendicular to bedding, most vitrinite occurs as elongate lenses. In sections parallel to \n\nbedding the vitrinite particles are commonly more equidimensional and are less likely to show \n\nrounded outlines. Other distinguishing proprieties are the reflectance and the \n\nautofluorescence. At low and medium ranks, vitrinite has a reflectance higher than that of \n\nliptinite macerals and lower than that of inertinite macerals. In the middle and upper ranks the \n\nliptinite reflectance converges on that of vitrinite. Within the anthracite range, the maximum \n\nreflectance of vitrinite converges on that of the macerals of the inertinite group, but the \n\nminimum reflectance of vitrinite remains less than that of inertinite macerals. Bireflectance of \n\nvitrinite is low at low ranks but becomes distinct in the middle and upper part of the bitumous \n\ncoal rank range. Within the semi-anthracite, anthracite and meta-anthracide rank range, \n\nbireflectance become high to extreme and is an important feature for vitrinites in this rank \n\nrange. Over the whole range of coal rank in any given sample, vitrinite typically shows a \n\nmuch lower dispersion of maximum reflectance about the mean that the other maceral groups, \n\nwhich is another property that shows the importance of its use. Over the rank range from 1 to \n\nabout 1.8 % the reflectance dispersion, which is generally low for vitrinite, becomes an \n\nimportant property in distinguishing vitrinite. When the vitrinite reflectance becomes greater \n\nthan about 2.0 %, its distinctive bireflectance becomes a major feature to aid in the distinction \n\nof vitrinite from inertinite, except in the case of some thermally altered rocks. The relief is \n\nanother distinctive feature of vitrinite macerals. At low and medium ranks the vitrinite \n\nexhibits negative polishing relief compared with other macerals. Over the rank range from 1 \n\n% to about 1.8 % the polishing relief of vitrinite increases and vitrinite has a tendency to \n\nfracture in compactation structures.  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER III- FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED TECHNICS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 40\t\n \u00a0\n\nIn summary, there are several characteristics of vitrinite that make it an excellent \n\npalaeotemperature indicator: \n\n \n\n- Vitrinite reflectance may be considered a non-retrogressive palaeogeothermometer for low-\n\ngrade metamorphic conditions (Stach et al., 1982); \n\n- Vitrinite is distributed in a wide range of sedimentary facies and may be obtained from a \n\nwide range of lithologies (Dow &amp; O\u2019Connor, 1982); \n\n- Measurement of vitrinite reflectance is precise and standardised by the international \n\nguidelines of the ICCP (2001); \n\n- The vitrinite reflectance technique is relatively cheap, easy and quick to measure and the \n\nresults are reproducible; \n\n- The reflectance of vitrinite increases more uniformly through the entire coal rank range than \n\nany other maceral group (Stach et al., 1982); \n\n- Reflectance is an objective parameter and is measured on a numerical scale and not \n\nestimated like spore color; \n\n- Small quantities of rock (less than 50 g) generally have sufficient vitrinite grains and small \n\nvitrinite particles (more than 2 \u00b5m) can be measured; \n\n- At high ranks (above 2,5 % Rm), vitrinite reflectance is essentially the only quantitative \n\nmicroscopic parameter that can be used to determine levels of organic maturation.  \n\n \n\n3.2 LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGY: APATITE FISSION TRACK  \n\n \n\nUranium is a radioactive element that decays by ? and ? emission but a small proportion of \n238U also decays by spontaneous fission. The Fission-track (FT) method is based on the \n\naccumulation of narrow damage trails (fission-tracks) in uranium-rich mineral grains, which \n\nform as a result of spontaneous nuclear fission decay of 238U in nature (Fleischer &amp; Hart, \n\n1972). Nuclear fission is a process during which a heavy, unstable nucleus splits into a pair of \n\nfragments of similar size with the release of a few neutrons and energy that results from the \n\nkinetic energy of the fission fragments (Tagami &amp; O\u2019Sullivan, 2005). The fission fragments \n\nwith massive positive charges are propelled from reaction site in opposite direction creating a \n\ndamage trail (FT) along the trajectories of the two fragments (Tagami &amp; O\u2019Sullivan, 2005). \n\nThe cross section of the track has a nearly circular shape of 6-10 nm diameter in apatite \n\nmineral grains (Paul et al., 1993). For its entire range, the track is a cylinder over a certain \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER III- FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED TECHNICS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 41\t\n \u00a0\n\nlength and tapers down in diameter near its end (Dunlap et al., 1997) in one or both terminals \n\nof a fission track (Carlson et al., 1990). Fission tracks are originally 10\u201320 \u00b5m long and their \n\ninitial length depends on the density of the crystal lattice (?16 \u00b5m in apatite). Owing to their \n\nnarrow width, fission tracks in their natural state (\u2018latent\u2019 tracks) are visible only using \n\ntransmission electron microscopy (Paul &amp; Fitzgerald, 1992). However they can be \u2018revealed\u2019 \n\nto become visible under an optical microscope with ?1000 x magnification, by polishing and \n\nchemically etching the surface of the crystal.  \n\nSince each spontaneous fission event creates one fission track, the track density is a function \n\nof the rate of fission decay, the concentration of 238U and the fission-track age of the sample \n\n(Braun et al., 2006). If a host rock is subjected to elevated temperatures, fission tracks that \n\nhave been formed up to that point in time are shortened progressively and eventually erased \n\nby the thermal recovery of damage (Fleischer &amp; Hart, 1972). This occurs by a diffusive \n\nprocess called annealing, during which atoms and electrons move through the crystal lattice \n\ntowards the ionized track. As for all diffusive processes, fission-track annealing takes place at \n\nstrongly temperature-dependent rates. As a result of annealing, the etchable length of a track, \n\nwhich is initially similar for all tracks in a given mineral structure, will be progressively \n\nshortened (Green et al., 1986; Carlson et al., 1990). Because the mean length of the tracks in \n\na sample determines the probability that they intersect an internal surface, the track density \n\n(and thus the apparent fission-track age) is also reduced during annealing (Green, 1988). The \n\ntemperature of total annealing for fluorapatite is 120\u00b110 \u00baC. Above these temperatures, \n\nannealing takes place at a faster rate than track production, so the effective apatite fission-\n\ntrack age remains perpetually zero. The annealing rate also depend on the crystallographic \n\norientation of the tracks, with tracks orthogonal to the C-axis of the mineral annealing more \n\nrapidly than those parallel to the C-axis (Green et al., 1986; Donelick et al., 1999). The mean \n\nwidth of fission-track etched pits has been proposed as a proxy measure for the varying \n\nannealing kinetics arising from compositional and structural variation (Ketcham et al., 1999; \n\nBarbarand et al., 2003). Because of the chemical and crystallographic dependence of \n\nannealing rates, the track-length distributions (measured as the standard deviation) become \n\nwider and single-grain ages become more dispersed with increasing annealing. The effects of \n\nannealing can be quantified by measuring the lengths of horizontal confined tracks (Gleadow \n\net al., 1986), i.e. tracks parallel to the polished face of the grain that do not cut the surface but \n\nhave been etched because they intersect cracks or other tracks allowing access to the etchant.  \n\nConfined track lengths can provide unique thermal history information. The distribution of \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER III- FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED TECHNICS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 42\t\n \u00a0\n\nconfined lengths of freshly produced induced tracks is characterized by a narrow, symmetrical \n\ndistribution with a mean length of around 16.3 \u00b5m and a standard deviation of the distribution \n\nof approximately 0.9 \u00b5m. In volcanic and related rocks which have cooled very rapidly, and \n\nnever been reheated above about 50 \u00baC, the distribution is also narrow and symmetric, but \n\nwith a shorter mean length of 14.5 to 15 \u00b5m, and a standard deviation of the distribution of \n\napproximately 1.0 \u00b5m. In granitic basement terranes, which are thought never to have been \n\nsignificantly disturbed thermally since their original post-emplacement cooling, the \n\ndistribution becomes negatively skewed, with a mean around 12 or 13 \u00b5m and a standard \n\ndeviation between 1.2 and 2 \u00b5m. This distribution is thought to characterize slow continuous \n\ncooling from temperatures from 120\u00baC to ambient surface temperatures. More complex \n\nthermal histories produce correspondingly complex distributions of confined tracks. The \n\ncontinuous production of tracks through time, coupled with the fact that the length of each \n\ntrack shrinks to a value characteristic of the maximum temperature it has experienced, gives a \n\nfinal length distribution which directly reflects the nature of the variation of temperature with \n\ntime. Most distinctive of the numerous possible forms of the final distribution are the bimodal \n\ndistributions, which give clear evidence of a two-stage history, including high and low \n\ntemperature phases.  \n\nOver the past three decades, fission-track thermochronology has become established as a \n\nwidely used technique for constraining the low-temperature thermal histories of rocks. \n\nExcellent reviews of the technique have been provided by Hurford (1983), Brown et al. \n\n(1994), Gallagher et al. (1998), Gleadow &amp; Brown (2000) and Ravenhurst &amp; Donelick \n\n(1992), while in-depth discussions of the theory can be found in Fleischer &amp; Hart (1972) and \n\nWagner and Van den Haute (1992). \n\n \n\n3.3 LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGY: APATITE (U-Th)/He  \n \n\nThe production of 4He (? particles) from uranium (U) and thorium (Th) series decay in rocks \n\nand minerals was the first geochronological dating method to be proposed early in the \n\ntwentieth century (Rutherford, 1907; Soddy, 1911,1914).  However, at that time geoscientists \n\nwere pursuing only \u2018absolute\u2019 or formation ages of rocks, notably in a quest to constrain the \n\nage of the Earth (Holmes, 1913). Since He diffuses easily out of the mineral lattice (a \n\nphenomenon that was not very well understood at the time), ages determined using U, Th and \n\nHe measurements were consistently much younger than those calculated using the U\u2013Pb \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER III- FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED TECHNICS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 43\t\n \u00a0\n\ncouple. Interest in the technique has been revived since Zeitler et al. (1987), who proposed \n\nthat the diffusive loss of He could be quantified and that He ages could be used to constrain \n\ncooling through very low temperatures. Subsequent diffusion experiments (Wolf et al., 1996; \n\nFarley, 2000) have demonstrated that the apatite (U\u2013Th)/He thermochronometer is sensitive \n\nto temperatures as low as 40 \u00baC, with effective closure occurring around 70 \u00baC, depending on \n\nthe cooling rate and mineral grain size. Results of several (U\u2013Th)/He studies in boreholes \n\n(Warnock et al., 1997; House et al., 1999) have supported this temperature range in natural \n\nsettings, within the uncertainty of the thermal histories experienced by the borehole samples. \n\nThe position of the He partial-retention zone has been compared with the partial-annealing \n\nzone of fission tracks in apatite and it was found that their relative positions were consistent \n\nwith the laboratory-derived estimates (Warnock et al., 1997; House et al., 1997; Stockli et al., \n\n2000) The low closure temperatures of the (U\u2013Th)/He system, especially in apatite, make it \n\nparticularly sensitive to near-surface cooling and thermal perturbations (Farley, 2000) \n\nBecause of the high diffusivity of He through most minerals and the relative rarity of He in \n\nthe environment, initial or excess He is usually not a concern. However, two factors are \n\nknown to bias strongly the measured He ages: ?-ejection and (U\u2013Th)-rich inclusions. The first \n\nis related to the fact that the ? particles produced by nuclear decay have a kinetic energy that \n\nallows them to travel up to 20 \u00b5m through the crystal lattice (Farley, 2000), and potentially to \n\nbe ejected from the mineral. This effect is corrected for by using numerical models of ?-\n\nejection for simplified grain geometries and homogeneous U distributions (Farley et al., \n\n1996). The second potential problem is related to the fact that many apatite grains contain \n\nminor inclusions of actinide-rich minerals such as zircon and monazite that contribute to the \n4He abundance in the sample but, because they are not fully dissolved by the standard \n\nchemical dissolution methods used on apatite, do not contribute to the U and Th \n\nmeasurements. Samples that contain such inclusions will therefore present \u2018parentless\u2019 He \n\nand yield excessively old ages. Minimizing this problem requires very careful sample \n\nselection by screening every grain to be dated, for even the smallest inclusions under a high-\n\nmagnification optical microscope. \n\n3.4 U-Pb GEOCHRONOLOGY  \n \n\nUranium has three naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, 238U, 235U and 234U. Each of these \n\nisotopes is the parent of a chain of radioactive daughter products that ends in stable isotopes \n\nof Pb. None of the parent isotopes decay directly to Pb, but instead follows a sequence of \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER III- FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED TECHNICS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 44\t\n \u00a0\n\nalpha and beta decays, that create a series of intermediate daughter isotopes, and always \n\nultimately result in a stable isotope of Pb (Bateman, 1910). Unlike other chronometers, the U-\n\nPb system exploits two independent decay schemes, 235U to 207Pb and 238U to 206Pb, where \n\nboth the 238U and 235U decay constants are relatively precise and accurately known (Jaffey et \n\nal., 1971). The half-lives of 238U (ca. 4.5 Ga) and 235U (ca. 0.7 Ga) are all much longer than \n\nthose for their respective daughters. This means that we can assume the production rate of the \n\ndaughter product is equal to the decay rate of the parent. Therefore, the decay of U isotopes \n\ncan be treated as though as it occurred directly to the respective Pb isotopes (Faure &amp; \n\nMensing, 2005). The advantage of two independent chronometers in the same mineral is that \n\nit is possible to detect small amounts of open system behaviour such as Pb loss or inheritance \n\nfrom an older component. The different half lives of 238U and 235U means that by the \n\nNeoproterozoic much smaller amounts of 235U (relative to238U) remain due to the higher \n\ndecay rate, therefore smaller amounts 207Pb are produced per increment relative to 206Pb. \n\nAlthough all three dates can be calculated from most published analyses, the relative \n\nprecisions are related to the analytical technique employed. When dating minerals, it is \n\nassumed that the system has been closed during its history, which in this case is the \n\nassumption of no Pb or U loss/gain. U is a mobile element in oxidizing environments, and can \n\nbe lost during weathering. Also, radiation damage of the crystals in which the U and Pb are \n\ncontained can facilitate Pb loss (Holmes, 1954). The effects of Pb loss on the calculated age \n\ncan be minimised if we assume that the Pb lost has the same isotopic composition as the Pb \n\nthat is remaining. If this is correct, we can calculate an age based on the 207Pb/206Pb ratio, \n\nwhich will be insensitive to Pb loss. Several publications which describe the U-Pb \n\ngeochronology system in more detail include Hanchar &amp; Hoskin, 2003 and Corfu, 2012. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IV-VITRINITE ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in \nthe South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 45\t\n \u00a0\n\nIV \u2013 VITRINITE REFLECTANCE ANALYSES \n \n\n4.1 SAMPLING \n \n\nA total of 48 samples were collected (fig. 2.2, 2.3) to complete a large organic maturity \n\ndataset for the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group in the South Portuguese Zone and in the Algarve \n\nBasin. The samples were collected from outcrops and from two mineral exploration boreholes \n\n(CST1 and CT1) that intersect the M\u00e9rtola Formation of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group  \n\nand the volcano-sedimentary complex of the South Portuguese Zone (fig. 2.2, 2.6). All \n\nsamples were mudstones and shales. The sampling strategy and the detailed description of the \n\nsamples were described in chapter II.  The results will constrain the maximum temperatures \n\nattained and allow a better understanding of the thermal history including the apatite fission \n\ntrack results. A batch of samples previously collected and studied in the context of projects \n\n\"Hydrocarbon source-rock potential of the Algarve Basin\" (PTDC/CTE-GEX/72694/2006) \n\nand \u201cAn Integrated Research on Provenance Indicators of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group: \n\nGeological Histories \u2018Concealed' in Sediments-PROVENANCE\u201c (POCI/CTE-\n\nGEX/60278/2004) were also used for compilation and comparison of the results. The \n\npublished results (Fernandes et al., 2012; Fernandes et al., 2013) of these two research \n\nprojects are presented in annex I.  \n\n4.2 SAMPLE PROCESSING  \n \n\nThe sample preparation for organic maturation analyses was undertaken in the laboratory \n\nfacilities of University of the Algarve (UAlg). The method of sample preparation for vitrinite \n\nreflection studies was adapted from Fernandes (2000) and consists of two steps (fig. 4.1). The \n\nfirst part comprised the isolation and concentration of the organic residues (kerogen) from the \n\nrock samples using cold acids, whilst the second part consisted of mounting and polishing the \n\norganic residues.  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IV-VITRINITE ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in \nthe South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 46\t\n \u00a0\n\n \nFigure 4.1 Sample preparation for vitrinite reflection studies, adapted from Fernandes (2000). \n \nFirstly, the samples were washed and crushed into small pieces (gravel sized fragments). \n\nApproximately 150 g of the crushed rock was put inside a teflon beaker with Hydrochloric \n\nacid (HCl) until all the carbonates were dissolved. Afterwards, the HCl was washed by \n\nsuccessive decants and Hydrofluoric acid (HF) was added to the beaker and maintained until \n\nall the minerals (including silicates) were dissolved. During this stage the sample was stirred \n\ntwice a day to ensure that the whole sample reacted with the acid. When all the mineral \n\ncontent had been dissolved, the used HF was removed by successive decants using distilled \n\nwater in order to neutralize the organic residuum. When neutralized, the concentrated organic \n\nmatter was wet sieved using a 15 microns mesh sieve cloth. The organic concentrate was then \n\ncollected with a pipette and stored in small beakers. \n\n \n\nThe organic matter concentrate was mounted in thin sections using the techniques adapted \n\nfrom Hillier &amp; Marshall (1988). The procedures were as follows: \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IV-VITRINITE ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in \nthe South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 47\t\n \u00a0\n\n1- Spray a cover slip on one side with dry lubrificant PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) and \n\nlet it dry for a few minutes; \n\n2- Pipette a small quantity of the organic residue as an aqueous suspension onto the \n\nPTFE-coated surface of the cover slip, allowing a wide dispersion on the cover slip, \n\nand wait two days until it is completely dry; \n\n3- Label a standard glass slide with a diamond pen with the sample reference; \n\n4- Prepare the necessary amount of polyester resin and mix 1 % of liquid hardener. \n\nGently stir to avoid the formation of air bubbles in the resin; \n\n5- Place a single drop of polyester resin in the centre of the slide and place the cover slip \n\nwith its adhering organic particles on top; \n\n6- After two hours carefully remove the glass cover slip using a razor blade. The result is \n\na thin layer of resin with embedded organic particles bonded to the frosted slide, \n\nshowing a level, mirror-like surface; \n\n7- Polish by hand the slides on a cloth lap using three grades of fine alumina powder, 1, \n\n0.3 and 0.05 micron respectively. During the polishing stages and at the end, the slides \n\nare cleaned using cold tap water. When the polishing is complete the slides are dried \n\nwith a hair dryer. \n\n \n\nThe vitrinite measurements were made using an Olympus BX51 reflected light microscope, \n\nequipped with an Olympus/SIS CView 3 high-resolution digital colour camera. The vitrinite \n\nreflectance (VR) measurements were made using the image processing modules supplied with \n\nMatlab\u00ae in the Mirone suite (Luis, 2007). This graphical tool calibrates a scale of 256 grey \n\nlevels with standards of know reflectivity. The standards used in this study have a reflectivity \n\nof 0.428, 0.595, 1.715, 3.15 and 5.37, for incident light with a wavelength of 546 nm and \n\nimmersed in a oil with a refraction index of 1.518 at 20 \u00baC (room temperature). The greyscale \n\nimages of the vitrinite particles are imported to this routine and the reflectance values are \n\nmeasured. Whenever possible, a total of 100 vitrinite particles were measured. When the lack \n\nof vitrinite particles did not allow this number of analyses to be acheived, a minimum of 30 \n\nVR measurements was accepted as statically valid (Mackowsky, 1982; McCormack, 1998, \n\nFernandes et al., 2013). \n\nMean random vitrinite reflectance (%Rr) was the vitrinite reflectance (VR) parameter chosen \n\nfor maturation because the mounting technique that was used provides non-oriented vitrinite \n\nparticles, and also because %Rr is the most widely used organic maturation parameter in the \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IV-VITRINITE ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in \nthe South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 48\t\n \u00a0\n\noil industry and is readily correlated with other maturity parameters (Fernandes et al., 2013). \n\nThe VR values measured are projected in histograms (annex II) using the \u201cDataGraph\u00ae\u201d \n\nsoftware that also calculates the mean and standard deviation. The arithmetic mean was \n\nconsidered to be the true vitrinite reflectance value for the sample. The palaeotemperatures of \n\nthe samples were calculated using an empirical equation described by Barker (1988) that \n\ncorrelates VR values with peak temperatures attained by the samples during burial: \n\n         T(\u00baC)=104ln(Ro+148)                                                   (1) \n\nwhere T is the maximum palaeotemperature attained by the rock and Ro the VR value \n\nmeasured. \n\n4.3 VITRINITE REFLECTANCE RESULTS AND MODELATION \n\n4.3.1 Borehole results (CST1 and CT1) \n \n\nThe two boreholes located in the South Portuguese Zone intersect the M\u00e9rtola Formation of \n\nthe Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group and the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex of the Iberian Pyrite \n\nBelt (see chapter II for more details).

In borehole CT1 the same trend evident in borehole \n\nCST1 is observed. The VR values range between 3.94 and 5.3 %. VR values do not show any \n\nincrease with the depth through the 584 m of section. The peak temperatures give a range of \n\nmaximum temperatures between 290 and 321 \u00baC. The lack of downhole increase in VR in \n\nboth boreholes hampers the calculation of palaeogeothermal gradients for the boreholes. \n\nThese results are in agreement with the values for the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group presented \n\nby Fernandes et. al (2012), Fernandes (2000) and McCormack (1999). The \n\npalaeotemperatures determined clearly show that these lithologies had passed through the \n\ntemperature windows  that reset the low-thermochronometers applied in this study.  \n\n4.3.2 Results from Outcrop Samples \n \n\nIn order to compare the VR results with the low-thermochronology studies, ten outcrop \n\nsamples were collected, where possible, from the same outcrops where the samples for \n\nthermochronology were collected. (fig. 2.2). \n\n \n\nIn the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group the vitrinite reflectance values range between 2.34 and \n\n5.57, with a highest value (12.94 %) measured from shales of the Brejeira Formation, located \n\nnear the intrusive contact of the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) (fig. 2.4). The VR \n\nvalues measured from the outcrops correspond to paleotemperatures between 236 and 326 \u00baC, \n\nwhereas near the MAC the paleotemperatures reach a maximum of 414 \u00baC.  \n\nThe samples from the Cretaceous strata have a value of 0.69 %Rr, corresponding to a \n\nmaximum palaeotemperature of 109 \u00baC. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IV-VITRINITE ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in \nthe South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 50\t\n \u00a0\n\nTable 4.2 Vitrinite reflectance results from outcrops.

These samples were collected in order to \n\nassess the effect of the intrusion on the regional vitrinite reflectance values. \n\nAssuming that the heat flux associated to the igneous intrusion has a symmetrical behaviour \n\neither side of the intrusion, samples were collected from the same layer located on the western \n\nside of the intrusion and from a distance of ca. 2 km as shown on figure 4.1. The results are \n\npresented in figure 4.2 and table 3.3. At the contact with the intrusion the VR reaches a \n\nmaximum value of 1.68 %. The values decrease to 1.1 % at 30 cm from the contact. After this \n\npoint the VR have some small variations but the main trend is a gradual decrease with the \n\nincrease in distance from the intrusion, until approximately 2 km the background VR value of \n\n0.66 % described by Fernandes et al. (2012) for this area is reached. A possible explanation \n\nfor the variations in VR values near the contact with the intrusion could be related to the \n\ndissipation of heat by the percolation of water along faults and along the contact due to the \n\ndifferences in permeability between the igneous rocks and the mudstones. Raymond &amp; \n\nMurchison (1988) state that the degree of sediment compaction, the volume of pore water and \n\nthe initial maturation level of the organic matter at the time of magmatic intrusion influence \n\nthe variations in VR more significantly than does the magma temperature.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSample Rr(%) SD n Lithology Formation Stratigraphy Palaeotemperature (\u00baC) Latitute Longitude\nRIT2 2.34 0.32 88 Shale M\u00e9rtola Fm. mid Vis\u00e9an 236.4 37\u00ba43'07.75''N 6\u00ba34'46.93''W\n\nVNC2 3.66 0.32 86 Shale Mira Fm.

It is also assumed that the \n\nintrusion is planar with a width L.  A coordinate system with the origin in the centre of the \n\nintrusion is employed. The initial conditions used by the model are at time t = 0 the \n\ntemperature T equals the intrusion Ti within and at the edges of the intrusion [-(L/2)<z<(L/2)] \n\nand the temperature Tb equals the background country rock temperature at distances \n\n[(L/2)<z<-(L/2)]. With these conditions the equation used in the model is given by Carslaw &amp; \n\nJaeger (1959):   \n\n \n\n? ?,? = ?? + !??!?\n2\n\nerf\n!\n2??\n\n2 ??\n+ ???\n\n!\n2+?\n\n2 ??\n                                       (2) \n\n \n\nwhere erf is the error function and z is measured as the distance from the center of intrusion. \n\nThe model allows for the introduction of boundary conditions such as the intrusion width, \n\nintrusion temperature, country rock temperatures and thermal diffusivity. \n\n \n\nThe intrusion at Ponta das Ferrarias is described as hypabyssal and resulted from multiple \n\ncrystallization phases (Henriques, 1954). In the model the intrusion was assumed to be \n\nshallow and into country rocks with a background temperature of ca. 100 \u00baC (Fernandes et al., \n\n2013). Due to multiple intrusion phases an initial temperature of 500 \u00baC was assumed. A \n\nthermal diffusivity of 32 km2Ma-1 was also assumed for modelling proposes. Figure 4.3A and \n\n4.3B show the results of the thermal evolution model of the Ponta das Ferrarias intrusion as \n\nwell as the thermal evolution of the country rocks. The results of the modelling show that \n\nbetween 20 and 1000 years after the emplacement of the intrusion, the temperature in the \n\ncentre of the intrusion decreased from ca. 500 \u00baC to ca. 200 \u00baC. Whereas, in the wall of the \n\nintrusion (75 m from the centre) the temperature decrease from ca. 275 \u00baC to 190 \u00baC. During \n\nthe same period the country rock temperatures at a distance &lt;2 km increase from a \n\ntemperature of 100 \u00baC to near 275 \u00baC at the contact with the intrusion and decrease back \n\ntowards to the background temperature at 2 km distance. The temperature at the contact \n\nremains elevated (30 \u00baC) above the background temperature after 10 000 years. After 0.1 Ma \n\nthe temperature at the contact is only 10 \u00baC above the background temperature and at 1 Ma \n\nthe temperature had equilibrated with the background temperature. In the country rocks at a \n\ndistance of 1 km from the intrusion, the temperature increased in the first 10 000 years to a \n\nvalue ca. 14 \u00baC above the background temperature. After 0.1 Ma the temperature remains 9 \u00baC \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IV-VITRINITE ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in \nthe South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 53\t\n \u00a0\n\nhigher that the background temperature and had completely equilibrated 1 Ma after \n\nemplacement.  \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 4.3 Thermal evolution model of the Ponta das Ferrarias intrusion as well as the thermal evolution of the \ncountry rocks. \n \n\nIf we compare the measured palaeotemperature data with the modeled temperature results  \n\n(fig. 4.4) it is clear that the response of vitrinite was not instantaneous with the increase of \n\ntemperature associated with the emplacement of the igneous rocks.

(2013) suggested that the high palaeogeothermal gradient of ca. 52 \u00baC km-1 \n\ncalculated for the Sagres-Lagos region in the western part of the Algarve Basin, could be \n\nattributed to the conductive heating related to Late Cretaceous igneous activity. For the \n\nparameters used in the modelling, equilibrium between the intrusion and the country rocks \n\nwas attained 0.1 My after the intrusion. These results show that the VR values for the country \n\nrocks were attained before the intrusion as stated by Fernandes et al. (2013) and the thermal \n\neffect of the intrusion is restricted to an area near the contact. Nevertheless, it is not \n\nconclusive if the Cretaceous intrusions may have affected the geothermal gradient in the \n\nWestern part of the Algarve Basin on a more regional scale.  \n\n4.4 SUMMARY  \n \n\nFernandes et al. (2012) suggested that the maximum burial temperatures in the Baixo \n\nAlentejo Flysch Group from the South Portuguese Zone were between 276\u2013325 \u00b0C and they \n\nwere achieved prior to Variscan deformation but remained high during and after deformation. \n\nThe same authors suggests that an advective heat transfer regime in the South Portuguese \n\nZone which produced relatively uniform high temperatures in the upper crust, overprinting \n\nany existing vertical VR gradient. The VR data presented in the two boreholes studied is \n\nconsistent with the data and conclusions of Fernandes et al. (2012). The samples collected \n\nfrom the boreholes CST1 and CT1 do not show any VR increase with the depth. The \n\ncalculated palaeotemperatures for the outcrop samples are between 236 and 326 \u00baC and agree \n\nwell with the VR data presented by Fernandes et al. (2012) for the Baixo Alentejo Flysch \n\nGroup. The highest VR value was measured near the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) \n\ncorresponding to a palaeotemperature of 414 \u00baC, indicating high temperatures related with the \n\nemplacement of the MAC. The metamorphic aureole caused by the intrusion of the MAC is \n\nestimated to be between 0.2 and 1 km wide (Rock, 1978; Gonz\u00e1lez-Clavijo &amp; Valadares, \n\n2003). The thermal impact from small intrusions related to the Monchique Alkaline Complex \n\nin the Algarve Basin could not be totally neglected, nevertheless in the Baixo Alentejo Flysch \n\nGroup the lithologies jad already attained a temperature following deposition and the VR \n\nvalues are not the results of small intrusions. \n\nThe VR results show that the temperatures attained in the South Portuguese Zone and in \n\nparticular the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group were high and significantly above the \u201cresetting\u201d \n\ntemperatures for the apatite fission track system and also for the apatite (U-Th)/He system. \n\nTherefore, it is possible to use both these thermochronological systems to constrain the recent \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IV-VITRINITE ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in \nthe South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 55\t\n \u00a0\n\nthermal history of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group. \n\nIn the Algarve Basin the VR values measured for the Upper Triassic-Hettangian units is 1-1.1 \n\n% (Fernandes et al., 2013; McCormack et al., 2007) and correspond to palaeotemperatures \n\nbetween 148 and 158 \u00baC. This range of temperatures is higher than the \u201cresetting\u201d \n\ntemperature for both the apatite fission track and the apatite (U-Th)/He systems. \n\nThe samples collected at Praia da Luz, near the contact with the basic intrusion at Ponta das \n\nFerrarias, show that the thermal effect of intrusion is restricted to a maximum length of ca. 2 \n\nkm from the intrusive contact. So, in the case of the Lower Cretaceous lithologies in the \n\nwestern part of the Algarve Basin, the maximum burial paleotemperatures attained were not \n\nenough to reset the apatite fission track system. Only near igneous intrusions did the \n\ntemperatures rise enough to reset to the apatite fission track system. In these situations it \n\nmight be possible to use the apatite fission track system to date the age of the intrusion as \n\nopposed to the country rock thermal history. However, the thermal modelling presented here \n\nfor the Lower Cretaceous Luz Mudstones intruded by the basic rocks at Ponta das Ferrarias, \n\nsuggests that near the intrusive contact maximum temperatures of 275 \u00baC were attained but \n\nreduced to 100 \u00baC after only 10 000 years.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 56\t\n \u00a0\n\nV\u2013APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES \n \n\nIn this chapter the analytical methodology for apatite fission track analyses are described and \n\nthe results obtained are presented and discussed.  \n\n5.1 SAMPLES  \n \n\nA total of sixty-seven samples were collected for low-temperature thermochronology, \n\ngeochronology and sedimentary provenance studies. The sampling strategy and sample \n\ndescriptions were provided in chapter II. The lithologies sampled were greywackes, quartz-\n\ngreywackes, sandstones, quartzites, granites and syenites.  \n\n \n\n5.2 HEAVY MINERAL SEPARATION AND APATITE CONCENTRATION \n \n\nThe heavy mineral separation was made using standard separation and concentration \n\nprocedures (jaw crushing, Wilfley table, heavy liquids and magnetic separation) at the \n\nFaculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia of University of the Algarve (FCT/UAlg), at the \n\nDepartamento de Geologia da Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias of Lisbon University (DG/FCUL) and at \n\nthe Department of Geology, Trinity College Dublin. The 63-200 \u00b5m size fraction was \n\nselected for the studies since it yielded the highest proportion of heavy minerals. \n\n5.3 SAMPLE PREPARATION FOR APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES \n \n\nAfter the mineral separation and apatite concentration, it is necessary to prepare apatite grain \n\nmounts before the apatite fission track (FT) analyses were performed. The procedure for \n\nmounting the apatite for counting is described in Donelick et al. (2005) and Ketchman (2011) \n\nand are summarized in figure 5.1. The first step is the preparation of mineral mounts with no \n\nor, at least, minimal surface relief. This is made by the preparation of an epoxy resin (e.g. \n\nStruers\u00ae epofix). Next, a few drops of resin were placed onto a slide and the apatite grains \n\nwere put over the resin. The mixture of resins and apatite grains were then stirred around with \n\nthe help of a wooden toothpick to ensure that they sink onto the glass surface of the slide and \n\nwere also randomly spread out, so that they would form a single layer of grains on the slide. \n\nThe mounts were then placed in a dry oven at a temperature of 30 \u00baC, for 12 hours to ensure \n\nthat the resin was completely hardened. The mounts are then ready for the grinding stage, \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 57\t\n \u00a0\n\nwhich is intended to grind down the surface of the mount, expose the apatite grains and make \n\na flat surface. This was achieved by grinding the mounts on a rotating wet sand paper (2400 \n\nmicro-mesh grade) during as many steps as necessary until the grains were exposed. Between \n\neach step, the mount was checked under a microscope in reflected light to see if all the grains \n\nwere exposed. The next step was polishing the mount using an automated polishing machine \n\nwith different diamond slurry compounds (6 \u00b5m, 3 \u00b5m, 1 \u00b5m and 0,25 \u00b5m) on cloth mats. \n\nOnce again, between each step the mount was checked under a microscope to verify the \n\nquality of the polishing and to see if the mount could pass to the next stage of polishing. This \n\nprocedure was continued until the surface of the apatite grain mount was perfectly polished. \n\nOnce the mount surfaces were free of scratches and imperfections, the exposed apatite grains \n\nin each mount were etched by immersing them in dilute HNO3, to reveal spontaneous fission \n\ntracks that intersected the polished apatite grain surface. The protocol employed was 5.5 N \n\nHNO3 for 20 s at 21 \u00baC. Once removed from the etchant, the mounts were immersed and \n\nstirred for a few seconds in a beaker with distilled water and then immersed and stirred again \n\nin a second beaker also with distilled water. Then, the mounts were removed from the \n\ndistilled water and dried with a paper towel. \n\nWhen the number of mounts for an individual sample was in large number, a selection was \n\nsent to a nuclear reactor to be irradiated with 238Cf. After the irradiation the etching \n\nprocedures for the mounts are the same as for a regular mount.  \n\nIn order to know the exact microscope coordinates of the analysed grains in each mount, it \n\nwas necessary to fix a set of precise marks in each mount. These reference marks make it \n\npossible to use the mounts in different stage systems like a LA-ICP-MS, or later reinsert them \n\non the FT stage and recall the stored locations from an apatite grain mount file. The reference \n\nmarks were scanning electron microscope target grids that were glued to the mount surface. \n\nThe target grids are 3mm diameter copper discs with an interior grid and a small letter at the \n\ncentre. Three different grid patterns with the letters A, L and Q were used. The grids were \n\nmounted in order to form a triangle on the edge of the grain mount. \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 58\t\n \u00a0\n\n                                                    \nFigure 5.1 Procedures used from the apatite concentration in heavy mineral separation up to FT counting and \ntrack length measurements.  \n5.4 APATITE FISSION TRACK MEASUREMENTS \n \n\nThe apatites were observed under a Carl Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope coupled to an \n\nAutoscan stage system. An Olympus/SIS CViewIII high-resolution digital colour camera was \n\nused to capture the images into the Autoscan? Fission Track Studio software. The software \n\ncontrols both the stage and the camera, and also has measuring tools that can be used for \n\ncounting the number of tracks and for measuring track lengths, tracks orientations and other \n\ntrack dimensions (dpar, dper, c-axis, etc).  \n\nThe first step in the determination of the FT ages consisted in the selection of the grains that \n\nare parallel to the crystallographic c-axis. This was done using a cross-polarised filter under \n\ntransmitted light as grains parallel to the c-axis are brightest under cross-polarised light. After \n\nthe selection of the grains, it was necessary to delimit an area for track counting, which could \n\nnot be smaller than the size of the laser beam (30 \u00b5m). With all the grains selected and the \n\nareas delimited, it was then possible to start counting the spontaneous tracks, the length of \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 59\t\n \u00a0\n\nconfined tracks, and some kinetic parameters such as Dpar and Dper. The procedures used to \n\nmeasure these parameters using the Fission Track Studio package software are described in \n\nKetcham (2011). \n\n5.5 APATITE U AND LA-ICPMS ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE \n \nApatite uranium concentrations were measured using a Photon Machines Analyte Excite 193 \n\nnm ArF Excimer laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Scientific iCAP Qc ICPMS in \n\nTrinity College Dublin. The analytical protocol employed is described in detail in Chew &amp; \n\nDonelick (2012), and integrates uranium concentration measurements for apatite fission track \n\ndating with REE and trace element analyses along with the isotopes required for required for \n\nU-Th-Pb geochronology.  The time interval for the baseline correction was 15 s and the \n\nanalysis was 45 s.  The laser spot size was set at 30 \u00b5m with a repetition rate of 4 Hz and a \n\nfluence of 3.1 mJ/cm2 to yield spot depths typically 10 \u00b5m deep.  A HelEx 2-volume sample \n\ncell was used with a He carrier gas flow of 800 mL/min.  Ar and N2 as an additional di-atomic \n\ngas to enhance sensitivity (flow rate of 6 mL / min) were admixed downstream. Typically 28 \n\nisotopes were measured in each apatite sample.   Of these isotopes, 43Ca was used as the \n\ninternal standard to correct for drift in instrument sensitivity and variations in ablation volume \n\nduring sessions. Common trace elements in apatite (e.g. Cl, Mn, Sr and Y) and the REE were \n\ndetermined along with the seven isotopes (200Hg, 204,206,207,208Pb, 232Th and 238U) commonly \n\nrequired for U-Th-Pb geochronology.  Data reduction for both trace element concentration \n\nmeasurements and U-Th-Pb geochronology was undertaken using the freeware Iolite package \n\nof Paton et al. (2011). The Iolite approach involves processing an entire analytical session \n\n(typically > 5 h) of data, which is not only more efficient but also greatly improves the \n\nconsistency and reliability of data reduction.  \n\nTrace element concentration measurements were undertaken using the \u201cTrace Elements\u201d data \n\nreduction scheme in Iolite.  Cl concentration measurements followed the analytical protocol \n\nof Chew et al. (2014a).  The 35Cl background-corrected signals for each apatite analysis were \n\nnormalized to the internal standard (43Ca) and then sample-standard bracketing was employed \n\nusing apatites of known Cl concentration (Bamble chlorapatite and Durango fluorapatite).   \n\nUranium concentration in unknown apatites followed the analytical protocol of Donelick et \n\nal. (2005).  In contrast to the ICPMS absolute calibration approach of Hasebe et al. (2003), \n\nwhich employs the 238U fission-decay constant, a fission track registration factor and a \n\ncalibration factor for etching and observation, Donelick et al. (2005) used a modified zeta \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 60\t\n \u00a0\n\ncalibration approach (cf. Hurford &amp; Green, 1983) for ICPMS apatite U concentration \n\nmeasurements.  The method assumes that the apatite 43Ca signal intensity during a given LA-\n\nICP-MS session acts as a proxy for the volume of apatite ablated, and hence the apatite \n238U/43Ca ratio yields relative U concentration measurements.  In this study an extensive \n\nprimary LA-ICPMS session was undertaken on crystals of Durango apatite that were \n\npreviously counted for fission tracks to yield a primary LA-ICPMS zeta factor.  These same \n\ncrystals of Durango apatite were then analysed in subsequent LA-IPCMS (along with apatite \n\nunknowns for fission-track dating) to yield a session-specific calibration factor on the primary \n\nzeta value.  Inter-session drift in both the primary and subsequent LA-ICPMS sessions was \n\ncorrected for by monitoring the 238U/43Ca ratio of NIST612 standard glass. The main \n\ndifficulty in apatite fission-track dating by LA-ICPMS is ensuring that the uranium \n\ndistribution with the portion of sample that generates fission tracks on the polished apatite \n\nsurface is quantified spatially, both horizontally (i.e. along the surface of the grain mount) and \n\nvertically.  The spontaneous track density in the samples analysed in this study was high \n\nenough to detect possible U zonation, while depth-related variations in U concentration were \n\naccounted for here by incorporating a function within the Iolite \u201cTrace elements\u201d data \n\nreduction scheme that weights appropriately the 238U/43Ca ratio with depth.  As LA\u2013ICPMS is \n\na destructive technique high quality 3-D images of all the counted grains were archived for \n\npotential reinvestigation in the future. \n\nApatite U-Th-Pb geochronology was undertaken using a modified version of VizualAge data \n\nreduction scheme (Petrus &amp; Kamber, 2012) for Iolite.  This data reduction scheme \n\n(VizualAge_UcomPbine) can correct for variable amounts of common Pb in any U\u2013Pb \n\naccessory mineral standard as long as the standard is concordant in the U/Pb (and Th/Pb) \n\nsystems after common Pb correction (Chew et al., 2014b).   A ca. 1 cm sized crystal of \n\nMadagascar apatite (Thomson et al., 2012) which has yielded a weighted average ID-TIMS \n\nconcordia age of 473.5 \u00b1 0.7 Ma (Cochrane et al., 2014) was used as the primary apatite \n\nreference material in this study. McClure Mountain syenite apatite (207Pb/235U TIMS age of \n\n523.51 \u00b1 1.47 Ma; Schoene &amp; Bowring, 2007) and Durango apatite (31.44 \u00b1 0.18 Ma, \n\nMcDowell et al., 2005) were employed as secondary standards.  Common Pb correction \n\nemployed weighted mean average 207Pb-corrected ages.  An iterative approach based on \n\nterrestrial Pb evolution models (Stacey &amp; Kramers, 1975) was used to calculate the initial Pb \n\nisotopic composition for detrital apatite samples as described in Chew et al.

The mean track length is 9.91 \u00b5m with a \n\nstandard deviation of 1.87 \u00b5m. The high number of confined tracks is due to the Cf irradiation \n\nthat this sample was subjected to. The track lengths are relatively short and their distribution \n\nindicates that this sample has stayed for a long period of time in the partial annealing zone \n\nand has a recent cooling history. The average Dpar is 1.38 \u00b5m and Dper 0.30 \u00b5m.  \n\nThe PIAS1 granite yielded a FT age of 108.2\u00b13.4 Ma. The mean track length is 11.59 \u00b5m \n\nwith a standard deviation of 1.65 \u00b5m. The confined track distribution show an almost bimodal \n\npattern that could be related to a complex history with more than one stage within the apatite \n\npartial annealing zone. The average Dpar is 1.33 \u00b5m and Dper 0.28 \u00b5m.  \n\nFor these two samples there is no clear relationship between the following parameters: FT \n\nages and the Cl content, FT ages and Dpar and between Dpar and the Cl content. However, \n\ndespite the samples being situated at a similar elevation and in the same geological unit, these \n\ntwo granites may have experienced different thermal stories. Recent tectonism or the \n\ndifference in granite (the content of Cl in apatites from sample LP1 (0.52 wt%) is higher than \n\nin sample Pias 1 (0.02 wt%) may explain the older FT age) could be a likely explanation for \n\nthe difference in FT ages between the two samples. Despite the difference in FT ages of the \n\ntwo samples, they are consistent with the FT ages obtained by Stapel (1999) for the Variscan \n\nZone. \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 64\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n    \nFigure 5.2 AFT results from Ossa Morena Zone.

However only one sample (CST1-4) from the M\u00e9rtola \n\nFormation yielded enough confined tracks to allow modelling of the data. \n\n5.6.2.1 M\u00e9rtola Fm. samples (fig. 5.3) \n \n\nThe FM1 greywacke has two populations of FT ages. These two populations were defined \n\nbased on the Cl content. The first population, with a Cl content lower than 0.35 wt% yielded \n\nan FT age of 79.4\u00b14.6 Ma with a Dpar of 1.18 \u00b5m and a Dper of 0.39 \u00b5m. The second \n\npopulation with a Cl content higher than 0.35 yielded a FT age of 212.6\u00b113.3 Ma with a Dpar \n\nof 1.18 \u00b5m and a Dper of 0.25 \u00b5m. No confined tracks were observed in this sample. The \n\noldest FT age is younger than the depositional age, meaning that the FT ages were at least \n\npartially reset after deposition.  The two populations of FT ages could indicate that the sample \n\nwas not totally annealed \u2013 possibly only the low Cl apatites were totally reset.  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 65\t\n \u00a0\n\nThe CST4-1 greywacke yielded an FT of 90.8\u00b13.8 Ma.

There \n\nwas not any observed relationship between FT ages and Cl content, FT age and Dpar, and Cl \n\ncontent and Dpar. The track lengths are relatively short and its broad distribution indicating \n\nthat the sample resided for a long period of time in the partial annealing zone. \n\nIn sample CT1-13 only 4 grains were analysed, yielding an age of 111\u00b19.5 Ma. No confined \n\ntracks were observed in this sample and no relationship was observed between between FT \n\nages and Cl content, FT age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar \n\nThe OL1 greywacke yielded an age of 157.9\u00b110.3 Ma. The mean track length is 9.97 \u00b5m with \n\na standard deviation of 2.61\u00b5m. The number of confined tracks is very low and their \n\ndistributions do not allow for any firm interpretations. There was no observed relationship \n\nbetween FT ages and Cl content, FT age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar. \n\nThe samples from the M\u00e9rtola Formation were collected in different geographic locations and \n\nstratigraphic levels (chapter II). The FT ages show that all apatites were reset after deposition. \n\nThe older FT age in sample FM1 (216 Ma) is from apatites with high Cl (>0.35 wt%) content. \n\nThe higher Cl content in these grains means that they could resist to the annealing and \n\npreserved an older thermal history. The others samples gave Cretaceous ages, meaning that \n\nafter the Triassic the M\u00e9rtola Formation lithologies were buried again reaching temperatures \n\nabove 120 \u00baC.  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 66\t\n \u00a0\n\n \nFigure 5.3 FT results from M\u00e9rtola Formation from the Baixo Alentejo Flych Group of South Portuguese Zone. \n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 67\t\n \u00a0\n\n5.6.2.2 Mira Fm.

The TL1 sandstone yielded an FT age of \n\n223.9\u00b17.9 Ma. The mean track length is 10.1 \u00b5m with a standard deviation of 1.53 \u00b5m. The \n\nhigh number of confined tracks is due to the Cf irradiation that this sample was subjected to. \n\nThe track lengths are relatively short and its distribution indicates that the sample may have \n\nresided for a long period of time in the partial annealing zone and underwent a recent phase of \n\nexhumation. The average Dpar is 1.30 \u00b5m and Dper 0.29 \u00b5m. \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 69\t\n \u00a0\n\nIn these three samples there was no observed relationship between FT ages and Cl content, \n\nFT age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar.  \n\nFig. 5.6 FT results from the Algarve Basin. \n\n \n\nThe apatite FT ages for the Upper Triassic samples are all older than the depositional age \n\n(\u00b1200 Ma).

This was due to several factors: (1) in the \n\ndetrital samples the apatite content is extremely low probably due to the lack of apatite in the \n\nsource rocks. In the Upper Triassic sandstone samples from the Algarve Basin, the apatite \n\ncontent change even within the same horizon; (2) In some igneous intrusive rocks collected \n\napatites was not observed in thin section or after heavy mineral separation; (3) For some \n\ngranite and syenite samples it is not always possible to undertake apatite fission track \n\nanalyses because the size of the crystals can be very small. \n\nConcerning the apatite fission tracks results, some remarks should be highlighted: \n\n- There is a notable similarity between the FT ages in the Ossa Morena Zone and the South \n\nPortuguese Zone indicating that uplift must have occurred as a block in these two Variscan \n\nZones; \n\n - The samples from the Ossa Morena zone are at the same elevation but are far apart from \n\neach other. The different ages could be related to the Cl content of apatites (average Cl \n\ncontent of 0.52 wt% in sample LP1 and 0.02 wt% in sample Pias1) or due to different local \n\ntectonic settings; \n\n-All the Baixo Alentojo Flysch Group samples have been totally reset after deposition and \n\nyield FT ages ranging from the Cretaceous (111 to 59.9 Ma) to the Upper Jurassic (Sample \n\nOL1-157.9 Ma); \n\n- In the FM1 greywacke sample the Cl content has a strong influence on the FT ages; \n\n- The FT ages from the Upper Triassic sandstone samples from the Algarve Basin indicate \n\nthat all ages are older than the depositional age, meaning that the samples were not buried to \n\ntemperatures exceeding 100 \u00baC; \n\n- The syenite samples from Monchique Alkaline Complex yield different FT ages that could \n\nbe related to different elevations (and different exhumation histories); \n\n- The Monchique samples have FT ages similar to the country rock FT ages (the Baixo \n\nAlentejo Flysch Group samples), which could suggest that the Monchique Alkaline Complex \n\nwas intruded into rocks that had an ambient temperature of ca. 90 \u00baC. If we consider a \n\npalaeogeothermal gradient of 30 \u00baC/km, the emplacement depth should be near 3 km.  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VI- APATITE (U-Th)/He AGE ANALYSES \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 72\t\n \u00a0\n\nVI\u2013APATITE (U-Th)/He AGE ANALYSES \n \n\nIn this chapter the analytical methodology for (U-Th)/He apatite dating and the results \n\nobtained will be presented and discussed.  \n\n6.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES \n \n\nThe (U-Th)/He analyses were performed on single crystals of apatite using the laboratory \n\nfacilities at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC). Apatite \n\ncrystals without fractures or inclusions and with a euhedral habit were selected. The samples \n\nfrom detrital lithologies contained few apatite grains and when present they were usually \n\nrounded or fractured. Therefore, it was only possible to analyse apatites from a single detrital \n\nsample (TL1) from Upper Triassic Silves sandstones of the Algarve Basin and from four \n\nigneous rock samples, two from the Ossa Morena Zone (PIAS1, PL1) and two from the \n\nMonchique Alkaline Complex (MM1 and MMP1). All these samples were already described \n\nand in chapters II and IV. \n\nApatite grains smaller than ~50 \u00b5m were avoided for (U-Th)/He dating, because such grains \n\nare subject to significant alpha recoil loss and therefore requiring large corrections which \n\ncause significant errors in the calculated ages (Farley, 2000). The selected grains were then \n\nindividually photographed, measured and packed into 1 mm long high purity Pt-foil tubes. \n\nThe tubes were placed in individual 2 mm holes in a copper sample pan. Helium was \n\nextracted from the minerals by heating the foil packets to 600 \u00b0C during 1-10 min with an 808 \n\nnm diode laser. The extracted gases were purified in an all-metal clean-up line, on a pair of \n\nliquid N-cooled charcoal traps. 4He concentrations were measured using an electron multiplier \n\nin a Hiden HAL4 quadrupole mass spectrometer by peak-height comparison to a calibrated \n\nstandard 4He. After the Helium extraction, each grain was unpacked, recovered and the U and \n\nTh were extracted by hot acid dissolution using HCl and HF, following the procedures of \n\nSUERC. The digested crystals were spiked with known amounts of tracer-isotopes (230Th-\n235U) and the solutions were then analyzed on a Plasmaquad PQ2.5 inductively coupled \n\nplasma mass spectrometer. Durango apatite was used as the age reference (Young et al., \n\n1969; McDowell &amp; Keizer, 1977; Farley, 2000). The ages were calculated using a spreadsheet \n\ndeveloped internally at SUERC.   \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VI- APATITE (U-Th)/He AGE ANALYSES \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and \nprovenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 73\t\n \u00a0\n\n6.2 APATITE (U-Th)/He AGES RESULTS \n \n\nFive Durango apatite fragments were analysed as reference material giving an average age of \n\n30.45\u00b10.64 Ma. This age is in agreement with the assumed (U-Th)/He age for the Durango \n\napatite of 31.9\u00b10.5 Ma (Young et al., 1969; McDowell &amp; Keizer, 1977; Farley, 2000).  \n\nFrom the Ossa Morena Zone the LP1 granite sample gave a mean (U-Th)/He age of 60.5\u00b11.2 \n\nMa and the PIAS1 granite gave a mean (U-Th)/He age of 108\u00b14.85 Ma. The TL1 sandstone \n\nfrom the Algarve Basin gave a (U-Th)/He age 142.9\u00b12.5 Ma. In the Alkaline Monchique \n\nComplex two samples were analysed. The MMP1 and MM1 syenites gave mean (U-Th)/He \n\nages of 32.0\u00b11.65 Ma and 38.5\u00b10.8 Ma, respectively. \n\n \nTable 6.1 (U-Th)/He age results.   \n\n \n\n5.3 DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY \n \n\nThe apatite (U\u2013Th)/He thermochronometer records the cooling of rocks through the 35\u201380 \u00b0C \n\ntemperature interval and can be used to determine the timing and rate of exhumation of the \n\nuppermost 1\u20133 km of the Earth\u2019s crust (Farley, 2000; Farley, 2002; Brady, 2002).

The analysis of a single age apatite mineral grain is not totally conclusive of a \n\nthermal history, but incorporating both apatite FT and (U-Th)/He ages into forward \n\nmodelling, a more restricted range of thermal history solutions can be extracted. This \n\nmethodology will be addressed in chapter VIII.  \n\nIn the Ossa Morena Zone the LP1 granite sample yields a He age of 60.5\u00b11.2 Ma, and the \n\napatite FT age for the same sample is 148\u00b16.1 Ma. This difference in age indicates that the \n\nsample stayed a long period of time in a temperature near the partial annealing/retention zone \n\nand it had a recent cooling history, based on the fission track lengths data described in chapter \n\nV. The PIAS1 granite also from the Ossa Morena Zone, has a (U-Th)/He age of 108\u00b14.85 Ma, \n\nsimilar to the apatite FT age (108\u00b13.4 Ma), that can be related with He implantation. \n\n \n\nIn the Algarve Basin the TL1 sandstone has a mean (U-Th)/He age of 142.9\u00b12.5 Ma and the \n\napatite FT age for this sample indicates that it has been reset after the deposition. This \n\nconclusion does not agree with burial thermal histories curves modelled by Fernandes et al. \n\n(2013) for the Sagres-Lagos area that indicate that the maximum temperature may have been \n\nattained during the late Cretaceous. However, the burial thermal history was constrained for \n\nthe Lagos area whereas the number of samples studied was superior to the Sagres area. In \n\nfact, the stratigraphic and paleontological data (Rocha, 1976) indicate that Sagres area \n\nconstituted a topographic high that separated the west Portuguese margin from the southern \n\nPortuguese margin in the Jurassic.  Both Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary sequences are \n\nmuch thinner in this area than in any other part of the basin (Terrinha, 1998). So, the sample \n\nTL1 may belong to a block that could constitute a structural high throughout the Mesozoic \n\ntimes. With this assumption and considering the maximum palaeogeothermal gradients \n\ncalculated for this area of 52 \u00baC/km (Fernandes et al., 2013), burial under a 1.5 km thick \n\nsuccession would be enough to reset the (U-Th)/He ages.  \n\nIn the Monchique Alkaline Complex the MM1 syenite yields a mean (U-Th)/He age of \n\n38.5\u00b10.8 Ma with is similar to sample MMP1 (mean (U-Th)/He  age of 32.0\u00b11.65 Ma).    \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 75\t\n \u00a0\n\nVII\u2013U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY  \n\t\n \u00a0\nIn this chapter the analytical methodology for U-Pb detrital zircon and apatite dating will be \n\npresented and discussed.  \n\n7.1 SAMPLE SELECTION AND PREPARATION \n \n\nFour greywackes samples from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group  (fig. 2.1) were selected for \n\ndetrital zircon dating. The selected samples were: sample FM1 collected at the base of the \n\nM\u00e9rtola Formation, ca. 100 m above the contact with the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex; \n\nsample AO1 collected at the base of the Mira Formation; and two samples from the Brejeira \n\nFormation, DZ1 and DZ12, collected from two different stratigraphic levels. Sample DZ1 was \n\ncollected from quartz-wacke beds positioned at the lower part of the Brejeira Formation while \n\nsample DZ12 was collected from greywacke beds in the upper part of this formation. Zircons \n\ngrains were separated and concentrated as described in chapter V. Zircons were mounted in \n\n2.5 cm epoxy mounts and polished to approximately half thickness prior to analysis. \n\nThe apatites analysed for U-Pb dating were from the same samples that was selected for \n\nfission track analyses. The analysed samples were described in chapter II and V, and \n\ncorrespond to: samples PIAS1 and LP1 from the Ossa-Morena Zone; samples FM1, CST1-4, \n\nCT1-13 and OL1 from the M\u00e9rtola Formation; sample AO1 from Mira Formation; sample \n\nAR1 from the Brejeira Formation; samples TL1, QR1, SC1 and CM2 from Upper Triassic \n\nSilves Sandstones from the of the Algarve Basin; and samples MM1 and MMP1 from the \n\nMonchique Alkaline Complex. The apatites were already mounted for FT analyses and only \n\nthe grains selected for FT measurements were analysed. \n\n7.2 ZIRCON ICPMS ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE \n \n\nZircon U-Pb data was collected from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group samples using a \n\nPhoton Machines Analyte Exite 193 nm ArF Excimer laser-ablation system coupled to a \n\nThermo Scientific iCAP Qc at the Department of Geology Trinity College Dublin. Nine \n\nisotopes (88Sr, 91Zr, 200Hg, 204,206,207,208Pb, 232Th and 238U) were acquired for each of the four \n\nzircon samples using a 30 \u00b5m laser spot, a 4 Hz laser repetition rate and a fluence of 3.31 \n\nJ/cm2.   The analytical procedure utilized repeated blocks of four zircon standards followed by \n\n20 unknown samples. The four zircon standard analyses comprised two analyses of the \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 76\t\n \u00a0\n\nprimary standard 91500 zircon (206Pb/238U TIMS age of 1065.4\u00b10.6 Ma; Wiedenbeck et al., \n\n1995), followed by one analysis each of Ple\u0161ovice zircon (weighted mean 206Pb/238U TIMS \n\nage of 337.13 \u00b1 0.37 Ma; Sl\u00e1ma et al., 2008) and Temora 2 zircon (206Pb/238U TIMS age of \n\n416.8 \u00b1 1.3 Ma; Black et al., 2004).   \n\nThe raw isotope data were reduced using the \u201cVizual Age\u201d data reduction scheme (Petrus &amp; \n\nKamber, 2012) of the freeware IOLITE package of Paton et al. (2011). User-defined time \n\nintervals are established for the baseline correction procedure to calculate session-wide \n\nbaseline-corrected values for each isotope. The time-resolved fractionation response of \n\nindividual standard analyses is then characterised using a user-specified down-hole correction \n\nmodel (such as an exponential curve, a linear fit or a smoothed cubic spline).  The data \n\nreduction scheme then fits this appropriate session-wide \u201cmodel\u201d U-Th-Pb fractionation curve \n\nto the time-resolved standard data and the unknowns.  Sample-standard bracketing is applied \n\nafter the correction of down-hole fractionation to account for long-term drift in isotopic or \n\nelemental ratios by normalizing all ratios to those of the U-Pb reference standards.  During \n\nthe course of analysis, the Ple\u0161ovice and Temora 2 secondary zircon standards yielded LA-\n\nICPMS U-Pb ages of 337.7 \u00b1 1.0 Ma and 417.7 \u00b1 1.4 Ma respectively. \n\n7.3 APATITE ICPMS ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE \n \n\nApatite uranium concentrations were measured using a Photon Machines Analyte Excite 193 \n\nnm ArF Excimer laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Scientific iCAP Qc ICPMS in \n\nTrinity College Dublin. The analytical protocol employed is described in detail in Chew &amp; \n\nDonelick (2012), and integrates uranium concentration measurements for apatite fission track \n\ndating with REE and trace element analyses along with the isotopes required for required for \n\nU-Th-Pb geochronology.  The time interval for the baseline correction was 15 s and the \n\nanalysis was 45 s.  The laser spot size was set at 30 \u00b5m with a repetition rate of 4Hz and a \n\nfluence of 3.1 mJ/cm2 to yield spot depths typically 10 \u00b5m deep.  A HelEx 2-volume sample \n\ncell was used with a He carrier gas flow of 800 mL/min.  Ar and N2 as an additional di-atomic \n\ngas to enhance sensitivity (flow rate of 6 mL / min) were admixed downstream. Typically 28 \n\nisotopes were measured in each apatite sample.   Of these isotopes, 43Ca was used as the \n\ninternal standard to correct for drift in instrument sensitivity and variations in ablation volume \n\nduring sessions. Common trace elements in apatite (e.g. Cl, Mn, Sr and Y) and the REE were \n\ndetermined along with the seven isotopes (200Hg, 204,206,207,208Pb, 232Th and 238U) commonly \n\nrequired for U-Th-Pb geochronology.  Data reduction for both trace element concentration \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 77\t\n \u00a0\n\nmeasurements and U-Th-Pb geochronology was undertaken using the freeware Iolite package \n\nof Paton et al. (2011). The Iolite approach involves processing an entire analytical session \n\n(typically > 5 h) of data, which is not only more efficient but also greatly improves the \n\nconsistency and reliability of data reduction.  \n\nTrace element concentration measurements were undertaken using the \u201cTrace Elements\u201d data \n\nreduction scheme in Iolite.  Cl concentration measurements followed the analytical protocol \n\nof Chew et al. (2014a).  The 35Cl background-corrected signals for each apatite analysis were \n\nnormalized to the internal standard (43Ca) and then sample-standard bracketing was employed \n\nusing apatites of known Cl concentration (Bamble chlorapatite and Durango fluorapatite).   \n\nUranium concentration in unknown apatites followed the analytical protocol of Donelick et \n\nal. (2005).  In contrast to the ICPMS absolute calibration approach of Hasebe et al. (2003), \n\nwhich employs the 238U fission-decay constant, a fission track registration factor and a \n\ncalibration factor for etching and observation, Donelick et al. (2005) used a modified zeta \n\ncalibration approach (cf. Hurford &amp; Green, 1983) for ICPMS apatite U concentration \n\nmeasurements.  The method assumes that the apatite 43Ca signal intensity during a given LA-\n\nICP-MS session acts as a proxy for the volume of apatite ablated, and hence the apatite \n238U/43Ca ratio yields relative U concentration measurements.  In this study an extensive \n\nprimary LA-ICPMS session was undertaken on crystals of Durango apatite that were \n\npreviously counted for fission tracks to yield a primary LA-ICPMS zeta factor.  These same \n\ncrystals of Durango apatite were then analysed in subsequent LA-IPCMS (along with apatite \n\nunknowns for fission-track dating) to yield a session-specific calibration factor on the primary \n\nzeta value.  Inter-session drift in both the primary and subsequent LA-ICPMS sessions was \n\ncorrected for by monitoring the 238U/43Ca ratio of NIST612 standard glass. The main \n\ndifficulty in apatite fission-track dating by LA-ICPMS is ensuring that the uranium \n\ndistribution with the portion of sample that generates fission tracks on the polished apatite \n\nsurface is quantified spatially, both horizontally (i.e. along the surface of the grain mount) and \n\nvertically.  The spontaneous track density in the samples analysed in this study was high \n\nenough to detect possible U zonation, while depth-related variations in U concentration were \n\naccounted for here by incorporating a function within the Iolite \u201cTrace elements\u201d data \n\nreduction scheme that weights appropriately the 238U/43Ca ratio with depth.

One occurs within the interval 367-447 Ma, with a peak at 420 \n\nMa, and is represented by 13 grains. The second population, corresponding to 40 grains, \n\nshows a large spectrum of ages within the interval 519-675Ma, with a peak at 608 Ma. \n\nTwenty-six zircons grains yielded ages in the interval 720-2150 Ma. \n\nThe youngest grain in sample DZ12 yielded an age of 350 Ma. Two small sub-populations lie \n\nwithin the intervals 350-371 Ma (4 grains) and 415-421 Ma (3 grains), with peaks at 366 and \n\n415 Ma, respectively. A prominent sub-population between 498-687 Ma (34 grains) exhibits \n\ntwo peaks at 623 Ma and 530 Ma respectively.  The remaining 24 zircons yielded ages \n\nbetween 720 and 2649 Ma.

The U\u2013Pb LA-ICP-MS data are shown in annex IV. The weighted \n\naverage diagrams were drawn using Isoplot v3.0 (Ludwig, 2003). \n\nUnlike the mineral zircon, apatite is unstable in acidic groundwaters and weathering profiles, \n\nhaving a limited mechanical stability in sedimentary transport systems (Morton &amp; Hallsworth, \n\n1999). It is, therefore, likely to represent only first cycle detritus, and would yield \n\ncomplementary information to detrital zircon provenance studies (Chew et al., 2011). \n\n7.5.1 Ossa-Morena Zone (PIAS1, LP1) \n\n \n\nThe apatites from samples PIAS1 and LP1 from the Ossa-Morena Zone were dated. \n\nIn the sample PIAS1, 24 apatite grains were analysed giving a mean 207Pb-corrected age for \n\nthe granite of 334.9\u00b14.3 Ma., whereas the sample LP1 gave a mean 207Pb-corrected age of \n\n340.5\u00b17.6 Ma from 19 analysed apatite grains. \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 82\t\n \u00a0\n\n7.5.2 South Portuguese Zone \n \n\n7.5.2.1 M\u00e9rtola Formation (FM1, OL1, CST4-1, CT1-13)  \n \n\nIn the M\u00e9rtola Formation the dated samples yield 207Pb-corrected ages that span between 329-\n\n357 Ma.

In sample CST4-1 \n\n20 grains were analysed giving a mean age of 329\u00b112 Ma and finally, seven apatites from \n\nsample CT1-13 were analysed gave a mean age of 357\u00b123 Ma. \n\n7.5.2.2 Mira Formation (AO1) \n \n\nOnly one sample from the Mira Formation was analysed. In sample AO1, eleven apatite \n\ngrains were analysed and gave a mean 207Pb-corrected age of 330\u00b111 Ma (ranging from 254-\n\n388 Ma). \n\n7.5.2.3 Brejeira Formation (AR1) \n \n\nIn sample AR1 from Brejeira Formation 12 apatites were analysed, giving a mean 207Pb-\n\ncorrected age of 517\u00b194 Ma (ranging from 301-388 Ma). \n\n7.5.3 Algarve Basin (CM2, SC1, QR1, TL1)  \n \n\nFour samples from the Upper Triassic Silves Sandstones in the Algarve Basin were analysed. \n\nIn the sample CM2, six grains were analysed giving a mean 207Pb-corrected age of 371\u00b182 \n\nMa.

It is beyond the scope of this work to characterize the granites of the Ossa Morena \n\nZone. Nevertheless, it is important to know the age of the granites bodies for \n\nthermochronological modelling (Chapter VIII-Forward and Inverse Modeling of Low-\n\ntemperature thermocronometer data). These new ages also could be useful in future regional \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 85\t\n \u00a0\n\ngeology studies.    \n\nThe Pias-Pedrog\u00e3o granite was dated in the Pedrog\u00e3o area by Rb-Sr in micas (Mendes, 1967, \n\n1968) and by K-Ar in muscovites (Carvalho et al., 1971), yielding ages of 301, 305 and \n\n308\u00b14 Ma, respectively. The sample PIAS1 was collected near the village of Pias giving an \n\napatite 207Pb-corrected mean age of 334.9\u00b14.3 Ma.  This age is 30 Ma older that the previous \n\ngeochronology data (Mendes, 1967,1968; Carvalho et al., 1971). Different closure \n\ntemperatures for the different geochronologic systems employed can explain this difference. \n\nAnother explanation could be that the Pias and Pedrog\u00e3o are two independent granite bodies \n\nwith different ages. The obtained age of 334.9\u00b14.3 Ma for the Pias granite is within the range \n\n348-332 Ma defined by Salman (2004) for the Carboniferous plutonic bodies in the Ossa-\n\nMorena Zone. \n\nThe granite of El Pedroso is considered post or synorogenic with respect to Variscan \n\ndeformation (IGME, 1975), but unlike the Pias granite its age is unknown. The apatites from \n\nsample LP1 gave a 207Pb-corrected mean age of 340.5\u00b17.6 Ma, therefore, the El Pedroso \n\ngranitic body also falls within the age range of the Carboniferous plutonic bodies the Ossa-\n\nMorena Zone defined by Salman (2004). \n\n \n\n7.7 SOUTH PORTUGUESE ZONE DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION OF \nRESULTS  \n \n\nThe South Portuguese Zone is viewed as a key unit within the context of the evolution of the \n\nVariscan Orogeny in Iberia (Oliveira, 1990). The deposition of the M\u00e9rtola Formation has \n\nbeen interpreted as resulting from the oblique collision between the South Portuguese Zone \n\nand the SW border of the Ossa-Morena Zone. This compressive tectonic regime began in the \n\nLate Visean and caused enhanced uplift and subsequent erosion of the Ossa Morena Zone and \n\nthe palaeoseafloor of the South Portuguese Zone by thrust stacking (Oliveira et al., 2006; \n\nPereira et al., 2006; Jesus et al., 2007; Rosas et al., 2008). During the Visean an average \n\nexhumation rate of ca. 2.6 km/Ma for the central areas of the Ossa Morena Zone was \n\nestimated using 40Ar\u201339Ar geochronology (Pereira et al., 2012a).  \n\nIn the M\u00e9rtola Formation samples, 68 % of the zircons (sample FM1) and all the apatites \n\n(samples FM1, OL1, CST4-1 and CT1-13) are encountered within the interval 326-388 Ma \n\n(fig. 7.1). There are several possible sources in the South Portuguese Zone and Ossa-Morena \n\nZone for detritus of this age. These include (1) volcanism in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) that \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 86\t\n \u00a0\n\nis constrained to the Famennian (375 Ma) and Tournaisian (345 Ma) (Rosa et al., 2009; \n\nBarrie et al., 2002); (2) the Campo Frio Batholith in the South Portuguese Zone which has \n\nyielded crystallization ages of between 360-349 Ma (De la Rosa et al., 2002; Rosas et al., \n\n2008); (3) syn-collisional magmatism and metamorphism on the southwest border of the \n\nOssa-Morena Zone which is constrained to between 355-320 Ma (Santos et al., 1987; Azor et \n\nal., 2008, Jesus et al., 2007). Additionally, a volcanic contribution from the Visean Toca da \n\nMoura and Cabrela volcano-sedimentary complexes of the Ossa-Morena Zone is also possible \n\n(Pereira et al., 2006). If we consider the rapid exhumation rates inferred for the Ossa Morena \n\nZone during the Visean (Pereira et al., 2012a), it is possible that these igneous rocks were \n\nexhumed and eroded very quickly after their emplacement. The M\u00e9rtola Formation contains \n\nabundant clasts of both felsic and mafic volcanic rocks (Oliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983; \n\nJorge et al., 2013) that suggest a provenance from the Pyrite Belt (Schermerhorn, 1971; \n\nMoreno &amp; S\u00e1ez, 1989; Moreno, 1993). 22 % of the U-Pb zircon ages are encountered within \n\nthe interval 410-630 Ma. This is consistent with a source in the Iberian Pyrite Belt and the \n\nOssa Morena Zone where Early Palaeozoic detrital zircon is common (Barrie et al., 2002; \n\nBraid et al., 2011; Pereira et al., 2012; Jorge, 2009). 10% of U-Pb zircon analyses are \n\nencountered within an interval of 637-2193 Ma. This age population is common in the detrital \n\nzircons of the Phyllite Quartzite Group rocks (Jorge, 2009). \n\nThe detrital zircon age spectrum of the Mira Formation sample (AO1) and the detrital apatite \n\ndata are very similar to that of the M\u00e9rtola Formation (fig. 7.1) The detrital zircon population \n\nin the 316-369 Ma interval exhibits a peak at 323 Ma and corresponds to 53 % of all the ages \n\ndetermined. The abundance of U-Pb zircon ages close to the depositional age of this \n\nformation (323-315 Ma) indicates the increasing importance of an extra-basinal source due to \n\nthe absence of zircons of this age in the South Portuguese Zone. The mean 207Pb-corrected \n\nage of detrital apatites (330\u00b111 Ma) corroborates this. The probable source(s) for this zircon \n\nand apatite population is the Variscan intrusives and their associated volcanic rocks on the \n\nsouthwest border of the Ossa-Morena Zone (Santos et al., 1987; Azor et al., 2008; Jesus et \n\nal., 2007). A second sub-population within a 400-612 Ma age range, with a peak at 482 Ma, \n\ncorresponds to 30 % of the U-Pb zircon ages. The source for zircons within this age interval is \n\nprobably the same as that described above for the M\u00e9rtola Formation (i.e. the Iberian Pyrite \n\nBelt and the Ossa Morena Zone). \n\nIn summary, the detrital zircon age spectra and the detrital apatite ages of the siliciclastic \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 87\t\n \u00a0\n\nsedimentary rocks of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations imply they have a strong extra-basinal \n\ncontribution component (the Ossa-Morena Zone) as well as a minor intra-basinal contribution \n\n(the South Portuguese Zone). The detrital apatite ages show the contribution of an extra-\n\nbasinal component. There is also a close similarity in the petrographic and geochemical \n\nsignatures of the sedimentary rocks of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations as both have source \n\narea(s) dominated by a granitoid composition with a minor contribution from mafic rocks \n\n(Jorge et al., 2013).  \n\nThe detrital zircon spectra and detrital apatite ages of the Brejeira Formation are different \n\nfrom those of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations (fig. 7.1). In the Brejeira Formation zircons \n\nyounger than 350 Ma are absent in contrast with the detrital zircon age spectra of the M\u00e9rtola \n\nand Mira formations. Zircons ages within the interval 367-467 Ma correspond to 16 % \n\n(sample DZ1) and 11 % (DZ12) of all dated grains, with a peak at 420 Ma in sample DZ1 and \n\ntwo peaks at 366 and 415 Ma in sample DZ12. Both samples contain abundant detrital zircons \n\nin the interval 470-800 Ma (53% in the sample DZ1 and 45% in the sample DZ12) with the \n\nmain peaks at 680 Ma and 623 Ma, respectively. The detrital apatites from sample AR1 show \n\na mean 207Pb-corrected age of 517\u00b194 Ma that falls in the previous interval (470-800 Ma). \n\nAges in the interval 470-800 Ma is generally correlated with tectono-magmatic events that \n\naffected the Cadomian-Avalonian Belt in Neoproterozoic-Lower Palaeozoic times. Zircons of \n\nthis age are also present in the Phylite Quartzite Group (Jorge, 2009; Braid et al., 2011) and in \n\nthe Tercenas Formation in the South Portuguese Domain (fig. 2.2; Pereira et al., 2012b). \n\nZircons within the 900 \u2013 1100 Ma interval are also present in the Brejeira Formation. Zircons \n\nof this age are common within the Avalonia-Meguma terranes (Nance et al., 1991; Barr et al., \n\n2003; Collins &amp; Buchan, 2004; Murphy et al., 2004a,b; Fyffe et al., 2009; Murphy et al., \n\n2010). Notably, detrital zircons in the 900 \u2013 1100 Ma age range are absent in both the M\u00e9rtola \n\nand Mira Formations.  \n\nThe data suggest that until late Serpukhovian times (315 Ma, top Mira Formation), the Ossa-\n\nMorena Zone and South Portuguese Zone contributed, in different proportions, to a foreland \n\nbasin represented by the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations (fig. 7.4, fig 7.5). If we assume that the \n\nmodel of prograding flysch sedimentation accompanying tectonic imbrication is correct, it \n\nwould be reasonable to assume that both formations shared the same source region and \n\nunderwent a considerable amount of sedimentary reworking. Our data indicate that this is \n\nvalid for the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations but not for the Brejeira Formation. Therefore, we \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 88\t\n \u00a0\n\nsuggest that a physical barrier had existed since mid Visean times separating the Mira and \n\nBrejeira formations. We also suggest that this physical barrier could be related to the \n\nforebulge that was formed in response to the tectonic stacking in the north and the sediment \n\nload of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations in the adjacent foreland basin (Fig 7.4, 7.5). During \n\nthe deposition of the M\u00e9rtola Formation, that coincided with the initial phase of foreland \n\nbasin development, the position of the forebulge coincided with the shallow marine facies of \n\nthe Carrapateira Group in the South Portuguese Domain as suggested by Oliveira &amp; Quesada \n\n(1998). \n\nFrom the late Bashkirian onwards tectonic loading and the progressive filling up of the \n\nforeland basin with a thick sedimentary pile (now represented by the M\u00e9rtola and Mira \n\nformations), may have caused uplift of the forebulge separating the foreland basin from the \n\nbackbulge depocentre. The continued development of the tectonic load in the north combined \n\nwith subsidence in the foreland basin may have caused the migration of the forebulge towards \n\nthe depocentre of the foreland basin (e.g. Allen &amp; Allen, 2006). The maximum sea level \n\nlowstand during Early Bashkirian times (Ross &amp; Murphy, 1988; Haq &amp; Shutter 2008) may \n\nalso have contributed to an efficient separation of the two depocentres and to possible erosion \n\nand reworking of the sedimentary rocks. In this proposed model for the evolution of the Baixo \n\nAlentejo Flysch Group, the Brejeira Formation was deposited in the backbulge depozone. The \n\ndetrital zircon data in this study suggest the main source area for the Brejeira Formation was \n\nthe Avalonia-Meguma terrane on the SW border of the foreland basin. The quartzites of the \n\nlower Brejeira Formation could be related to reworking of the sediments associated with the \n\nforebulge barrier when sea level started to rise during the mid to Late Bashkirian (Ross &amp; \n\nMurphy, 1988; Haq &amp; Shutter, 2008; Pereira et al., 2007). \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 89\t\n \u00a0\n\n                          \nFigure 7.4 Schematic palaeogeographic reconstruction during Pennsylvanian times showing the position of the \nSPZ in relation to adjacent terranes (adapted from Simancas et al., 2004).

In the Algarve Basin, the siliciclastic sediments of the Upper Triassic, termed the \n\n\"Silves Sandstones\" (Rocha, 1976), are comprised of sandstones and conglomerates organized \n\ninto positive sequences, with oblique stratification and lenticular structures (Palain, 1976). \n\nThese sediments were likely deposited in a fluvial sedimentary environment associated with \n\nnumerous alluvial fans in a semi-desert region, above the Variscan basement (Palain, 1976). \n\nPalaeocurrents indicate a sedimentary provenance mainly from NE to SW and S and is \n\nassumed that the Variscan basement was the main sedimentary source for the Silves \n\nSandstones (Palain, 1976). The sedimentary provenance analysis of the Upper Triassic in the \n\nAlgarve Basin is extremely complex. The deposition in a fluvial sedimentary environment, \n\nwhere several alluvial fans may overlap in the alluvial plain at the base of a mountain range \n\nthat was being eroded, makes it difficult to constrain the sedimentary provenance. In this \n\nscenario, the drainage network started eroding lithologies that were overlapped and \n\njuxtaposed during the Variscan orogeny and contributed in different proportions to the Upper \n\nTriassic basins, yielding different detrital zircon and apatite ages that are difficult to correlate \n\nto a specific area/formation. \n\nThe samples from the Upper Triassic Silves Sandstones in the Algarve Basin were collected \n\nat the same stratigraphic level above the Carboniferous-Mesozoic angular unconformity \n\n(chapter II). The detrital zircon spectra from sample CM2 shows a population in the interval \n\n204-633 Ma, with peaks at 269, 435 and 577 Ma. It is possible to define a Permian population \n\n(15% of the total, corresponding to 13 grains) (fig. 7.2). In Portugal there are uncertainties  \n\nabout the deposition of Permian sediments due to absence of rocks from that age, but it is \n\nvery well constrained in the Viar Basin (fig. 2.4) located in southern Spain (Sierra et al., 2009 \n\nand references therein). Sample TL1 has a small zircon population in the age interval 308-322 \n\nMa (corresponding to 34 grains), with a peak at 312 Ma and the Permian age are absent. The \n\npalaeocurrents are distinct from the two sample locations. For the locality where sample CM2 \n\nwas located, the main palaeocurrents directions are from the NE, while for sample TL1 they \n\nare from W and SW (Palain, 1976). Although the palaeocurrents only recorded the very last \n\npiece of paleoflow, it is possible to assume that a strong contribution from the Permian Viar \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 92\t\n \u00a0\n\nBasin for the east part of the Algarve Basin. However, detrital apatites of Permian age were \n\nfound in all samples meaning a possible extension of this episodic fluvial contribution. \n\nRegarding the apatite detrital ages, the CM2 and SC1 showing mean 207Pb-corrected ages of \n\n371\u00b182 Ma and 315\u00b118 Ma, respectively. These ages are also present in detrital apatites from \n\nsamples QR1 and TL1. There are several possible sources in the South Portuguese Zone and \n\nOssa-Morena Zone for zircons and apatites of this age (308-370 Ma) and they were discussed \n\nin section 7.7. During the deposition of the Silves Sandstones, the BAFG could have been \n\neroded and contributed to the sediments of the Algarve Basin. So, it is possible to assume a \n\ncontribution from the \u201cVariscan mountain chain\u201d with small contributions from local areas \n\nlike the Permian Viar Basin.  \n\nSample CM2 shows a continuous detrital zircon age spectra from all temporal periods, with \n\npeaks at 577, 920 and 1666 Ma. Sample TL1 yields a more restricted age interval with peaks \n\nat 585 and 969 Ma. A BAFG provenance could be inferred for these samples since the most \n\nprobable source for the Upper Triassic sediments were the BAFG and other rock units of the \n\nSPZ.  \n\nThe detrital apatite and zircon U-Pb data show possible multiple sources. A local component \n\nis possible for the ubiquitous Permian and Carboniferous ages. However, the abundance of \n\nPrecambrian ages could be related to either the South Portuguese and Ossa Morena Zones \n\nlithologies or the Avalonia-Meguma terranes (Nance et al., 1991; Barr et al., 2003; Collins &amp; \n\nBuchan, 2004; Murphy et al., 2004a,b; Fyffe et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 2010) and could \n\ncontribute to the Algarve Basin. In conclusion, a combination of sources is envisaged for the \n\nTriassic sediments. A detailed study of the provenance of the Triassic in Portugal study is \n\nnecessary to understand better the different sedimentary sources. \n\n7.9 SUMMARY  \n \n\nRegarding the detrital and igneous apatite and zircon U-Pb results, some conclusions can be \n\ndrawn: \n\n- The two granites samples from the Ossa Morena zone yield an apatite mean 207Pb-corrected \n\nage of 334.9\u00b14.3 Ma for Pias-Pedrog\u00e3o Granite and 340.5\u00b17.6 Ma for El Pedroso granitic \n\nbody; \n\n- The two samples from the Monchique Alkaline complex (MAC) gave an apatite mean 207Pb-\n\ncorrected age of 70.9\u00b14.6 (MM1) and 89\u00b118 Ma (MMP1). Both these ages are within the \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic \nmaturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 93\t\n \u00a0\n\naccepted interval accepted for the emplacement of the MAC age of 72\u00b12 Ma (Rock, 1978; \n\nMacIntyre and Berger, 1982; Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; Miranda et al., 2009); \n\n- U-Pb detrital zircon spectra and 207Pb-corrected apatite ages from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch \n\nGroup show significant differences between the M\u00e9rtola/Mira formations and the Brejeira \n\nFormation. The main peaks in the detrital zircon spectra of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations \n\nare at c. 330 Ma in contrast to the Brejeira Formation where the main peaks are at c. 615 Ma. \n\nThe same difference is reflected in the detrital apatite ages where in the M\u00e9rtola they range \n\nbetween 329-357 Ma and in the Mira they range between 254-388 Ma.  This is in contrast to \n\nthe Brejeira Formation (ranging from 301-388 Ma). Moreover, U-Pb detrital zircon ages of \n\n900\u20131100 Ma are encountered in the Brejeira Formation but are absent in the M\u00e9rtola and \n\nMira formations. spectra difference between the M\u00e9rtola/Mira and Brejeira formations is also \n\nsupported by independent geochemical and petrographic studies (Jorge at al. 2013). The U-Pb \n\ndetrital zircon age spectra of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations indicate a provenance from \n\nboth extrabasinal (Ossa-Morena Zone) and intrabasinal (South Portuguese Zone) sources. The \n\nabundance of detrital zircon in the 500-750 Ma and 900-1100 Ma age range intervals in the \n\nBrejeira Formation suggests a source region in the Avalon-Meguma terranes with minor \n\nrecycling from the South Portuguese Domain (Tercenas Formation). The different provenance \n\nareas for the units of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group are attributed to the presence of a \n\nphysical barrier (forebulge) that formed during the development of the foreland basin. This \n\nbarrier was active since mid Visean times and separated the sub-basins where the \n\nM\u00e9rtola/Mira and Brejeira Formation sediments accumulated; \n\n- In the Upper Triassic siliciclastic \u201cSilves Sandstones\u201d is derived from multiple sources. \n\nPermian ages that are more pronounced in the samples located in the eastern part of the basin \n\nand could reflect a local contribution of the Viar Basin or similar basins in Spain. A detailed \n\nstudy of the provenance of the Upper Triassic in Portugal is necessary to understand better its \n\nsedimentary sources. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VIII- FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING OF LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCRONOMETER \nDATA \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance studies in the South Portuguese Zone and \nAlgarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 94\t\n \u00a0\n\nVIII\u2013FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING OF LOW-TEMPERATURE \nTHERMOCHRONOMETER DATA \n \n\nIn this chapter the low-temperature thermochronology modelling will be described and is \n\nbased on the data presented in previous chapters.  \n\n8.1 FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING PRINCIPLES  \n \n\nFission tracks in minerals (e.g. apatite, zircon) forms continuously over time at a rate that \n\ndepends solely upon the initial concentration of uranium present in the minerals. Earlier-\n\nformed fission tracks tend to be shorter than later-formed tracks, as they will have had more \n\ntime to anneal, and may have experienced higher temperatures. The distribution of fission-\n\ntracks observed in a mineral represents a sampling off all tracks formed and annealed during \n\nits residence below the total annealing temperature. In essence, they preserve an integrated \n\nthermal history, making this thermochronometer a uniquely powerful tool for thermal history \n\nreconstruction (Ketcham, 2005). A detail report of the fission track behaviour with respect to \n\ndifferent time-temperature histories was described in Chapter III. \n\nWhenever possible, the samples with acceptable quality and quantity of data were used to \n\nmodel its thermal history using the HeFTy software v.1.7.0 (Ketcham &amp; Donelick, 2000). \n\nHeFTy is a computer program for forward and inverse modelling of low-temperature \n\nthermochronometric systems, including apatite fission-track, (U-Th)/He ages, and vitrinite \n\nreflectance (Ehlers &amp; Farley, 2003). Forward modeling is the process of predicting what \n\nthermochronometer measurements one would expect for a sample that has undergone a \n\nparticular temperature history (Ketcham, 2011). By superimposing measured data, a \n\ncomparison between the predicted results and measured values is possible. The inverse \n\nmodeling is the process by (1) which a large number of forward models are generated by \n\nHeFTy, (2) the predicted thermochronometer results are compared to the measured values for \n\neach forward model, and (3) the good and acceptable forward models are used to provide \n\nquantitative constraints on time-temperature histories that are permitted by the measured data \n\n(Ketcham, 2011). \n\nThe input values are the age of the sample, the apatite fission-track measurements, the \n\nconfined track lengths, is some cases the (U-Th)/He ages and finally the vitrinite reflectance \n\nvalues. Before starting the inverse modelling it is necessary to draw a forward model, that is a \n\nprediction of a temperature history based on previously obtained information, such as the \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VIII- FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING OF LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCRONOMETER \nDATA \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance studies in the South Portuguese Zone and \nAlgarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 95\t\n \u00a0\n\nperiod when peak temperatures were attained, uplift episodes, etc. Furthermore, this \n\ninformation could also be used to constrain the paths over determined time-temperature \n\nintervals. In this study, data has been modelled using the Ketcham et al. (1999) annealing \n\nmodel. For each run in an inverse model some constraints were added to improve the quality \n\nof the modelled thermal paths in comparison with the measured values. For comparing the \n\nresults obtained, the software use two statistics to gauge how well the data and the model \n\nresults match. They are the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (or K-S Test) and Kuiper\u2019s Statistic. \n\nMore details on how the software uses these statistic tests are described in detail in Ketcham \n\n&amp; Donelick (2000) and Ketcham (2005). Ketcham (2011) consider for each of those statistics \n\nthat a \u201cgood\u201d result corresponds to a value of 0.50 or higher, which is the expected value if \n\nthe time-temperature path and kinetic model are in fact the correct ones. An \u201cacceptable\u201d \n\nresult corresponds to a value of 0.05 or higher. These values indicate that the model has not \n\nfailed the null hypothesis test that forms the basis of these statistics. A model is considered \n\n\u201cgood\u201d if two conditions are met. First, the mean of goodness of fitness (GOF) test value \n\nmust be at least 0.5. Second, the minimum GOF value must be greater than 1/(N+1), where N \n\nis the number of GOF tests that were run. A model is considered \u201cacceptable\u201d if all statistics \n\nfor all populations are above 0.05. The \u201cAge GOF\u201d is the goodness-of-fit between the age \n\ndata and age predicted by the model. The results of thermal histories modelled are show with \n\ndifferent code colours. Each good path is displayed as a yellow line, and each acceptable path \n\nis displayed as a green line. A region encompassing all acceptable paths is coloured in green. \n\n8.2 FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING RESULTS \n\n8.2.1 Ossa Morena Zone (PIAS 1, LP1) \n\n8.2.1.1 Sample PIAS 1 \n \nThe Pias granite (sample PIAS1) is located within the Ossa Morena Zone. The mean apatite \n\nU-Pb age of the granite is 334.9\u00b14.3 Ma and it yields a fission track age of 108.2\u00b13.4 Ma. \n\nThe fission tracks lengths yield a mean value of 13.32\u00b11.8 \u00b5m. The apatite (U-Th)/He mean \n\nage is 108\u00b14.85 Ma, which is very similar to the FT age most probably to He implantation in \n\nthe apatite giving and older age that was expected, so it was not used in the modelling. \n\n \n\nTo design the forward model (the blue line in fig. 8.1) a moderate cooling rate of (5.7 \u00baC/Ma) \n\nfrom the age of granite emplacement at 340 Ma until a temperature of 100 \u00baC in the Upper \n\nTriassic at 200 Ma was used. Although the sample would have been expected to cool quickly \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VIII- FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING OF LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCRONOMETER \nDATA \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance studies in the South Portuguese Zone and \nAlgarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 96\t\n \u00a0\n\nfrom magmatic emplacement temperatures, subsequent Variscan orogenesis (325 \u00b0C \n\n(Fernandes et al., 2012)) likely resulted in high ambient temperatures and a slow cooling rate. \n\nA temperature of 100\u00baC was adopted considering a normal geothermal gradient (30 \u00baC/Ma) \n\nfor the sample at 3 km depth, which is estimated from the distance to the Carboniferous-\n\nMesozoic unconformity, situated 90 km to south. For the inverse modelling no particular \n\nconstraints were added, only the crystallization age and the actual temperature (dashed red \n\nline). The green lines represent the good-fit paths and the black line represents the best-fit \n\nmodel.  \n\n \n\nThe inverse model results show that the values obtained for the fission track ages of 112 Ma \n\n(G.O.F.= 0.21) and confined fission track lengths of 13.69\u00b11.44 \u00b5m (G.O.F.= 0.2) agree with \n\nthe measured data. The model results show a slow cooling history since intrusion (334.9 Ma) \n\nuntil near 240 Ma, from a temperature of 500 \u00baC to 400 \u00baC. After the 235 Ma until 200 Ma the \n\nsample cooled from a temperature of 400 \u00baC to 100 \u00baC at a rate of 8.5 \u00baC/Ma.  From 200 Ma \n\nuntil 65 Ma the sample cooled at a rate of 5.2 \u00baC/Ma until it reached 75 \u00baC. From 65 Ma until \n\nthe present the sample cooled at a rate of c. 1 \u00baC/Ma to near surface temperatures.   \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8.1 Completed inversion model for the sample PIAS1.

The mean \n\napatite U-Pb age of the granite is 340.5\u00b17.6 Ma and it yields a fission track age of 148.3\u00b16 \n\nMa. The fission tracks lengths yield a mean length of 12.51\u00b11.3 \u00b5m. The mean apatite (U-\n\nTh)/He age is 60.5\u00b11.2 Ma. \n\nTo design the forward model (blue line in fig. 8.2) a slow to moderate cooling path from 340 \n\nMa until a temperature near 75 \u00baC in the Triassic at 200 Ma was considered based on the same \n\nconsiderations used for the Pias granite model. In the LP1 sample it was necessary to consider \n\na temperature of 75 \u00baC at 200 Ma instead of 100\u00ba C in order to better adjust the model to the \n\nobserved data. After a period at temperatures of 60-70 \u00baC, a fast cooling event from 15 Ma to \n\nnear surface temperatures was invoked. \n\nFor the inverse modelling no particular constraints were. The green lines represent the good-\n\nfit paths and the black line represents the best-fitting model. The inverse model results show \n\nthat the values obtained for the fission track ages of 141 Ma (G.O.F.=0.22), for the confined \n\nfission track lengths of 12.92\u00b11.27 \u00b5m (G.O.F.=0.11) and for the He ages of 25.4 Ma  \n\n(G.O.F.=0.07) agree with the measured data (table 8.2). \n\nThe model results show a slow cooling history since the intrusion (340.5 Ma) until ca. 250 \n\nMa, from a temperature of 500 \u00baC to 370 \u00baC. After 250 Ma until the 210 Ma the sample cools \n\nfrom a temperature of 370 \u00baC to 80 \u00baC at a rate of 7 \u00baC/Ma. The oldest fission track in the \n\nmodel simulation has an age of 220 Ma. Since the 210 Ma until 35 Ma the granite cools very \n\nslowly at a rate of 0.05 \u00baC/Ma until reaching 70 \u00baC. From 35 Ma until the present day the \n\nsample cools ata a rate of c. 3.5 \u00baC/Ma to near surface temperatures. The model did not fit the \n\nHe age with the measured He age, however it passed in the test with a G.O.F of 0.07.   \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER VIII- FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING OF LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCRONOMETER \nDATA \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance studies in the South Portuguese Zone and \nAlgarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 98\t\n \u00a0\n\n \nFigure 8.2 Completed inversion model for the sample LP1.

Apatites from this sample show a fission-track age \n\nof 90.8\u00b13.8 Ma with a mean confined track length of 11.04\u00b11.99 \u00b5m. The vitrinite reflectance \n\nfor the shale in contact with this sample is 4.2\u00b10.4 %Rr, which is equivalent to a maximum \n\ntemperature between 290 and 310 \u00baC. \n\nTo design the forward model the following conditions were considered: rapid burial followed \n\nby maximum heating after deposition due to an advective fluid flow system (Fernandes et al., \n\n2012). With these peak temperatures all the FT ages should be reset. Considering the position \n\nof the Carboniferous-Mesozoic unconformity that outcrops ca. 20 km south of the location of \n\nthis sample, this sample was near the surface, most probably during the Permian (due to the \n\nabsence of Permian rocks). At 200 Ma (Upper Triassic) a temperature of 100 \u00baC was adopted \n\nbased on an inferred sample depth of 2.5 km depth (based on the geometry of the \n\nCarboniferous-Mesozoic unconformity surface) using a typical gradient (30 \u00baC/km). \n\nRegarding the inverse modelling, for each run a constraint was added to improve the quality \n\nModeled Measured G.O.F.

The model result shows a heating episode relating to burial and \n\nthe last phase of Variscan tectonics. After the maximum temperature was reached at 320 Ma, \n\nthe sample cooled at a rate of 2 \u00baC/Ma until to 150 \u00baC at 260 Ma. The sample then resided for \n\na long period in the partial retention zone until 20 Ma, which allows for the reduction of the \n\nfission track lengths and the large dispersion in their distribution (standard deviation of 1.99 \n\n\u00b5m). The oldest fission track in the model simulation has an age of 135 Ma. During this \n\nperiod the cooling rate was very low at c. 0.4 \u00baC/Ma. This could be attributed to the \n\ndeposition of Mesozoic sediments. From 20 Ma until the present day, the cooling rate was c. 2 \n\n\u00baC/Ma.  \n\n8.2.3 Monchique Alkaline Complex (MM1) \n \nThe MM1 syenite belongs to the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC). The apatite U-Pb  \n\nage of this sample is 70.9\u00b14.6 Ma and it yields a fission track age of 49.6\u00b14.3 Ma. The fission \n\ntracks lengths yield a mean length of 12.7\u00b10.8 \u00b5m. The apatite (U-Th)/He mean age is \n\n38.5\u00b10.8 Ma. \n\nConsidering the fission track ages from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group from the South \n\nPortuguese Zone (ranging from 157 to 59.9 Ma), this demonstrates that the Baixo Alentejo \n\nFlysch Group formations were already at a temperature below 100 \u00baC before or during the \n\nMonchique Alkaline Complex intrusion. This implies that the host rock was \u201ccold\u201d and \n\nlocated ca. 2 km depth if a normal palaeogeothermal gradient of 30 \u00baC/km was considered. \n\nSo, the forward model has been designed to reflect a thermal history of a sample that \n\nunderwent rapid cooling after intrusion, followed by a long period in the partial retention zone \n\nthat may reduce considerably the fission track lengths, and a recent and rapid cooling event \n\nthat may have started at 5 Ma.  \n\nModeled Measured G.O.F.

The values produced by the inverse model for the fission track ages of \n\n53.9 Ma (G.O.F.=0.31) and for the confined track lengths of 12.99\u00b11 \u00b5m (G.O.F.=0.31), are \n\nsimilar to those measured (table 8.4). After the intrusion, the sample cooled in a period of 6 \n\nMa from magmatic temperatures to ca. 100 \u00baC. This rapid decrease in temperature was due, \n\nmost probably, to the host rock temperature during the intrusion, which had an ambient \n\ntemperature of ca. 100 \u00baC. At, approximately, 66 Ma the sample was at a temperature of 70 \n\n\u00baC. The oldest fission track obtained by the model is 68.7 Ma. The sample stayed at near \n\nconstant temperatures the top of the partial retention zone (ca. 60 \u00baC) from 68.7 Ma to 5 Ma, \n\nallowing for the observed reduction in the fission track lengths. From 5 Ma to present day \n\ntimes, the sample cooled from a temperature of 50 \u00baC to near-surface temperatures.

Both samples \n\nexhibits low to moderate cooling rate until 240 Ma and subsequent fast cooling throughout \n\nthe Triassic until 200 Ma to a temperature within the apatite PAZ, which allows for the \n\nobserved reduction in the confined fission track lengths. The last phase of cooling to near \n\nsurface temperatures started in the Pias Granite at 65 Ma. If we assume a paleogeothermal \n\ngradient of 30 \u00b0C/km, an estimated exhumation rate of 30 m/Ma can be considered for the \n\nPias granite from 65 Ma to the present day. In the El Pedroso granite sample, the last phase of \n\ncooling started at 35 Ma. Assuming a paleogeothermal gradient of 30 \u00b0C/km an exhumation \n\nrate of 65 m/Ma from 35 Ma until the present day is inferred. \n\nThe greywacke sample CST1-4 was the only sample modelled from the Baixo Alentejo \n\nFlysch Group from the South Portuguese Zone. It shows a heating episode after burial that is \n\nrelated to the last phase of Variscan tectonics. After the maximum temperature of 300 \u00baC was \n\nattained at 320 Ma, the sample cooled to a temperature of 150 \u00baC at 260 Ma. From 260 Ma \n\nuntil 20 Ma, the sample stayed in the apatite PAZ, which allowed for the observed reduction \n\nin the fission track lengths and the large dispersion in the track length distribution. This could \n\nbe related to possible reburial associated with deposition of the Mesozoic sediments of the \n\nAlgarve Basin. From 20 Ma until the present day, and considering a typical paleogeothermal \n\ngradient of 30 \u00baC/Ma, an exhumation rate of ca. 75 m/Ma can be inferred for this sample. \n\nThe syenite sample MM1 from the Monchique Alkaline Complex, cooled very fast from \n\ninitial magmatic temperatures to around 70 \u00baC. This rapid cooling event was most probably \n\nassociated with thermal relaxation from magmatic temperatures to ambient host rock \n\ntemperatures, of 70 \u00baC. It is most likely that the intrusion of the MAC was at very shallow \n\ndepths in the crust (ca. 2 km depth). The sample stayed at a constant temperature near to the \n\ntop of the partial annealing zone from 68.7 Ma to 5 Ma, allowing for the observed reduction \n\nin the fission track lengths. From 5 Ma to the present times, the sample cooled from a \n\ntemperature of 50 \u00baC to near surface temperatures. If we consider a typical geothermal \n\ngradient of 30 \u00b0C/Ma, the MAC underwent an exhumation of 0.3 km/Ma from 5 Ma to the \n\npresent day. \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IX-APATITE REE AS PROVENANCE INDICATOR \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation \nand provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n103\t\n \u00a0\n\nIX \u2013 APATITE REE AS PROVENANCE INDICATOR \n \n\n9.1 REE IN APATITE \n \nApatite is a widespread accessory mineral and its abundance is directly related to the \n\nphosphorus content of the rock and inversely with increasing silica content (Bergst\u00f8l, 1972; \n\nLaznicka, 1993; Frietsch &amp; Perdahl, 1995). The crystallisation of phosphate phases is an \n\nimportant process in natural systems as the residence of important trace elements such as U, \n\nTh, Sr, and REE is at least partly controlled through melt/phosphate mineral equilibrium \n\n(Toplis &amp; Dingwell, 1996). Apatite may concentrate a high proportion of whole-rock REE, \n\nSr, U and Th (Ayers &amp; Watson, 1993; Roeder et al., 1987). As a result, apatite is a potentially \n\nsensitive recorder of the trace-element chemistry of the rock system at the time of its \n\ncrystallization. (Sha &amp; Chappell, 1999; Belousova, 2000; Belousova et al., 2001). So, the \n\ncompositional REE variations can yield specific information regarding the parent rock type \n\nallowing the effective recognition of the host rock (fig. 9.1) (Belousova et al., 2002). Within \n\nindividual rock types, the trace-element patterns of apatite are sensitive to the degree of \n\nfractionation and oxidation state of the host magma, which are important parameters in \n\ndetermining mineral potential (Belousova et al., 2002). However, apatites from some rock \n\ntypes show a wide range of trace-element composition even within single samples, and \n\napatites from granitoids and pegmatites show particularly large standard deviations. This \n\nreflects the compositional variation found across large crystals from pegmatites, and between \n\nindividual grains within single samples. Both features may be explained by evolution in the \n\nparental melt composition during fractionation, or by late crystallization of apatite from \n\nisolated pockets of residual melts that are slightly different in composition and trapped in the \n\ninterstices between early-crystallizing major minerals (Belousova et al., 2002). Another \n\ndiscriminating factor is the presence (or absence) of an Eu anomaly. In general, the amplitude \n\nof Eu anomalies in apatites increases towards more fractionated rocks and probably is \n\ncontrolled by the crystallisation of feldspars, which preferentially concentrate Eu2+ from the \n\nmelt (Budzinski &amp; Tischendorf, 1989).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IX-APATITE REE AS PROVENANCE INDICATOR \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation \nand provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n104\t\n \u00a0\n\n                \n\n           \n\nFigure 9.1 Chondrite-normalised averaged trace-element abundances of apatites from different rock types \n(adapted from Belousova et al., 2002)  \n \n\nOne of the advantages of using the laser ablation technique in fission track studies is the \n\npossibility to measure minor and trace elements along with the REE. Although this was not \n\nthe primary goal of this thesis, an attempt was made to infer the provenance of the apatites \n\nanalysed for fission track analysis based on their REE content. The methodology applied to \n\nextract the REE data was the same as described in chapter VII. All the results from the \n\nanalyses are normalised relative to a Ca stoichiometric concentration in apatite of 393600 \n\nppm. The chondrite normalization was undertaken using the values given by McDonough &amp; \n\nSun (1995).  \n\n9.2 APATITE REE RESULTS \n \n\nIn the follow sections the results (fig. 9.2 and annex V) were described and grouped similar to \n\nthe previous chapters.  \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IX-APATITE REE AS PROVENANCE INDICATOR \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation \nand provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n105\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCHAPTER IX-APATITE REE AS PROVENANCE INDICATOR \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation \nand provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n106\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 9.2 Chondrite-normalised trace-element abundances of apatites from the different samples.

In the present work only a few trace elements were analyzed in \n\naddition to the REE and it was not possible to to calculate other discriminant ratios (Sr versus \n\nY and Mn, (Ce/Yb)cn  versus the sum of REE, and Y against Eu/Eu*) that can be more useful \n\nto reveal the nature of the source rocks. Only the Y vs Eu/Eu* discriminatiion plot was \n\npossible to use. In general, the analyses of the REE patterns and the Eu anomalies are more \n\nuseful than the discriminant plots. The dispersion of values in the granitic rocks is an example \n\nof how it is dangerous to use only one discriminant plot to ascertain the parent igneous rock \n\ntype. The REE patterns and the discriminant plot show some differences between the M\u00e9rtola \n\nand Mira formations and the Brejeira Formation. The mafic contribution is more pronounced \n\nin the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations than in the Brejeira Formation. This difference was \n\nalready detected in geochronologic (chapter VII), geochemistry and petrologic studies (Jorge \n\net al., 2013). The samples from Algarve Basin (CM1, QR1, TL1) show a great dispersion of \n\npossible source rocks types.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X-CONCLUSIONS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South \nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 112\t\n \u00a0\n\nX \u2013 CONCLUSIONS \n \n\nThe work undertaken in this PhD research was focused on the investigation of the thermal \n\nhistory of the South Portuguese Zone and the Algarve Basin. The original study area was \n\nexpanded to include the southern limit of the Ossa Morena Zone. Another field of \n\ninvestigation was the sedimentary provenance of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group of South \n\nPortuguese Zone and the Algarve Basin. Several techniques (vitrinite reflectance, \n\nthermochronology (apatite fission track and (U-Th)/He) and geochronology (detrital zircon \n\nand apatite U-Pb) were applied to achieve the objectives proposed in chapter I.  The main \n\nresults of this thesis can be synthetized in the following sections. \n\n \n\n10.1 THERMAL HISTORY \n \nThe vitrinite reflectance and calculated palaeotemperatures for the outcrop samples in the \n\nBaixo Alentejo Flysch Group are between 236 and 326 \u00baC and agree with the vitrinite \n\nreflectance (VR) data presented by Fernandes et al. (2012). This range of temperatures are \n\nclearly above the temperature of partial annealing zone (PAZ) of the apatite fission track \n\nsystem and also of the He partial retention zone of (HePRZ) of the (U-Th)/He system and \n\nthus these thermochronological data record the exhumation history of the Baixo Alentejo \n\nFlysch Group. \n\n- The samples collected from boreholes CST1 and CT1 in the M\u00e9rtola Formation from the \n\nSouth Portuguese Zone do not show any increase in VR with depth.  The results agree with \n\nthe model proposed by Fernandes et al. (2012) that suggests there was an advective heat \n\ntransfer regime in the South Portuguese Zone which produced relatively uniform high \n\ntemperatures in the upper crust, overprinting any existing vertical VR gradient; \n\n- The highest VR value in Baixo Alentejo Flysh Group was measured in the Brejeira \n\nFormation, near the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) corresponding to a \n\npalaeotemperature of 414 \u00baC, indicating high temperatures related with the emplacement of \n\nthe MAC. The metamorphic aureole caused by the intrusion of the MAC is estimated to be \n\nbetween 0.2 and 1 km wide (Rock, 1978; Gonz\u00e1lez-Clavijo &amp; Valadares, 2003).

The last phase of cooling to near surface \n\ntemperatures started in the Pias granite at 65 Ma. If we assume a paleogeothermal gradient of \n\n30 \u00b0C/km, an estimated exhumation rate of 30 m/Ma can be considered for the Pias granite \n\nfrom 65 Ma to the present day. In the El Pedroso granite sample, the last phase of cooling \n\nstarted at 35 Ma. Since then until the present an exhumation rate of 65 m/Ma was inferred; \n\n \n\n- The greywacke sample CST1-4 from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group from the South \n\nPortuguese Zone shows a heating episode after burial related to the last phase of Variscan \n\ntectonism. After the maximum temperature of 300 \u00baC was attained at 320 Ma, the sample \n\ncooled to a temperature of 150 \u00baC at 260 Ma. From 260 Ma until 20 Ma, the sample stayed in \n\nthe apatite partial annealing zone (PAZ). This long period within this narrow temperature \n\nwindow could be related to a possible reburial associated with deposition of the Mesozoic \n\nsediments of the Algarve Basin. From 20 Ma until the present day an exhumation rate of 75 \n\nm/Ma can be inferred for this sample; \n\n \n\n- In the Algarve Basin the VR values measured for the Upper Triassic-Hettangian units is 1-\n\n1.1 % (Fernandes et al., 2013; McCormack et al., 2007) and correspond to \n\npalaeotemperatures between 148 and 158 \u00baC. This range of temperatures means that the \n\napatite fission track and the apatite (U-Th)/He systems record the exhumation history of the \n\nAlgarve Basin; \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X-CONCLUSIONS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South \nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 114\t\n \u00a0\n\n- In the case of the Lower Cretaceous lithologies (VR=0.6%) in the western part of the \n\nAlgarve Basin, the maximum burial paleotemperatures attained were not enough to reset the \n\napatite fission track system; \n\n- The samples collected at Praia da Luz, near the contact with the basic intrusion at Ponta das \n\nFerrarias, show that the thermal effect of this intrusion is restricted to a maximum distance of \n\nca. 2 km from the intrusive contact. In these situations it might be possible to use the apatite \n\nfission track system within the intrusion aureole to date the age of the intrusion. The thermal \n\nmodelling for the Lower Cretaceous Luz Mudstones intruded by the basic rocks at Ponta das \n\nFerrarias, suggests that near the contact maximum temperatures of 275 \u00baC were attained and \n\nwhich cooled to 100 \u00baC after only 10 000 years;  \n\n- The AFT ages from the Upper Triassic sandstone samples from the Algarve Basin indicate \n\nthat all ages are older than the depositional age, meaning that the samples did not pass \n\nthrough the apatite partial annealing zone. So, the thermal anomaly created by the MAC \n\nintrusion did not affect the Algarve Basin lithologies. However, the thermal effect from small \n\nintrusions related to the Monchique Alkaline Complex in the Algarve Basin could not be \n\ntotally neglected; \n\n- The syenite sample MM1 from the Monchique Alkaline Complex, cooled very fast from \n\ninitial magmatic temperatures to around 70 \u00baC. This rapid cooling event was most probably \n\nassociated with thermal relaxation from magmatic temperatures to ambient host rock \n\ntemperatures (70 \u00baC). It is most likely that the intrusion of the MAC was at very shallow \n\ndepths in the crust (ca. 2 km depth). The sample stayed at a constant temperature close to the \n\ntop of the partial annealing zone from 69 Ma to 5 Ma. From 5 Ma to the present times, the \n\nsample cooled from a temperature of 50 \u00baC to near surface temperatures. If we consider a \n\ntypical geothermal gradient, the MAC underwent an exhumation rate of 0.3 km/Ma from 5 \n\nMa to the present day.  \n\n10.2 GEOCHRONOLOGY AND MINERAL PROVENANCE \n \n\nRegarding the detrital/igneous apatite and zircon U-Pb results and also the REE apatite \n\ncontents, some conclusions can be drawn: \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X-CONCLUSIONS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South \nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 115\t\n \u00a0\n\n- The two granites samples from the Ossa Morena Zone (Pias and El Pedroso) yielded an \n\napatite mean 207Pb-corrected age of 334.9\u00b14.3 Ma for Pias-Pedrog\u00e3o Granite and 340.5\u00b17.6 \n\nMa for El Pedroso granitic body. The calculated age of the Pias-Pedrog\u00e3o granite is 30 Ma \n\nolder that the previous geochronologic data (Rb-Sr in micas (Mendes, 1967; Mendes, 1968) \n\nand K-Ar in muscovites (Carvalho et al., 1971). Different closure temperatures for the \n\ndifferent geochronologic systems employed can explain this difference. Both granites \n\nanalysed (Pias and El Pedroso) fall within the age range of the Carboniferous plutonic bodies \n\nin the Ossa-Morena Zone defined by Salman (2004); \n\n \n\n- U-Pb detrital zircon spectra and also the 207Pb-corrected apatite ages from the Baixo \n\nAlentejo Flysch Group show significant differences between the M\u00e9rtola/Mira formations and \n\nthe Brejeira Formation. This difference was also detected in the apatite REE analyses (chapter \n\nVIII) and in the geochemistry and petrologic studies (Jorge et al., 2013); \n\n \n\n-The U-Pb detrital zircon age spectra of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations indicate a \n\nprovenance from both extrabasinal (Ossa-Morena Zone) and intrabasinal (South Portuguese \n\nZone) sources. The abundance of detrital zircon in the 500-750 Ma and 900-1100 Ma age \n\nintervals in the Brejeira Formation suggests a source region in the Avalon-Meguma terranes \n\nwith minor recycling from the South Portuguese Domain (Tercenas Formation); \n\n \n\n- The different provenance areas for the units of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group are \n\nattributed to the presence of a physical barrier (forebulge) that formed during the development \n\nof the foreland basin. This barrier was active since mid Visean times and separated the sub-\n\nbasins where the M\u00e9rtola/Mira and Brejeira Formation sediments accumulated; \n\n \n\n- The sandstones from the Upper Triassic were derived from multiple sources. Permian ages \n\nare more pronounced in the samples located in the eastern part of the basin and could reflect a \n\nlocal contribution from the Permian Spanish basins. \n\n10.3 IMPLICATION IN ECONOMICAL GEOLOGY \n \n\nThe thermal history information derived in this study may have an impact on the economical \n\npotential for conventional gas exploration in South Portuguese zone. The vitrinite reflectance \n\nvalues in the South Portuguese Zone corresponds to a maximum temperature between 236 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X-CONCLUSIONS \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South \nPortuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\n\t\n \u00a0 116\t\n \u00a0\n\nand 326 \u00baC. These post-deposition temperatures were achieved not only from the burial, but \n\nalso from tectonic deformation. Deformation was followed by a cooling phase related to a \n\nphase of exhumation until 200 Ma which is consistent with the presence of a Carboniferous-\n\nTriassic unconformity in the geological record. Oil and gas generated after the deposition may \n\nhave been lost during this phase. From 200 Ma until the 20 Ma the temperature remains \n\nconstant between 100 and 60 \u00baC within the apatite partial annealing zone (and the oil \n\nwindow), however the rocks shows at these stage were already overmature. The pronounced \n\nexhumation since the Late Cretaceous may have destroyed any petroleum system. \n\nNevertheless the history in the offshore basins could be different and more detailed studies on \n\noffshore are required.  \n\nThe sedimentary input to the offshore basins since the Late Cretaceous, as result of the uplift \n\nand subsequent exhumation, must have created reservoirs for the Algarve Basin petroleum \n\nsystem and more studies will be necessary to ascertain this. \n\n10.4 SUGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORKS \n \n\nAlthough many samples were collected during this project, it was not possible to obtain \n\nfission track data from all of these samples due to the problems reported in chapter V. A \n\ncomplementary study in Southwest Portugal Domain and in the Brejeira Formation will be \n\nnecessary to explain if the SW Portuguese region has a different thermal history compared to \n\nthe rest of South Portugal as suggested by Fernandes et al. (2012). \n\nThe thermal history of the Algarve Basin is well constrained onshore but not in the offshore. \n\nMaturation and low-temperature thermochronology studies should be undertaken on the new \n\noil exploration boreholes that will be drilled in this basin in the near future and the results \n\ncompared with the onshore thermal history.    \n\nIt is also important that a detailed study be carried out on the provenance of the Upper \n\nTriassic sandstones in Portugal to understand better its sedimentary sources as this too \n\nremains uncertain. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nREFERENCES  \u201cAn Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone \nand Algarve Basin (South Portugal)\u201d \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 117\t\n \u00a0\n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAbad, I., Mata, M.P., Nieto, F., Velilla, N., 2001.

Organic matu-\nration levels and the thermal history of this basin have been ascertained, together with their implications\nfor future exploration. Maturity was determined using vitrinite reflectance and spore fluorescence/\ncolour. The succession was extensively sampled (158 onshore samples and 20 samples from two offshore\nwells). Thermal history was modelled using 1D PetroMod?.\n\nA palynostratigraphic study of two offshore wells was also completed, showing thick marlelimestone\nsequences of Middle and Upper Jurassic age. Hiatuses were identified in the offshore wells within the\nJurassic section and between the Jurassic and the Miocene sections.\n\nThe Mesozoic rocks of the Algarve Basin lie within the oil window. Vitrinite reflectance ranges from\n0.52e0.7%Rr in the Lower Cretaceous to 1e1.1%Rr in the Upper TriassiceHettangian. Miocene rocks that\nunconformably overlie the Mesozoic strata are immature (0.42e0.47%Rr). Maturation levels increase with\nincreasing age of the strata, indicating that burial was the main process controlling maturation. Thick\nmarlelimestone sequences of the Middle Jurassic (Callovian) and the Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) are the\nmain source rock intervals. The Miocene successions of both offshore wells contains reworked vitrinite\nand palynomorphs with maturation levels similar to the Mesozoic rocks of the basin, suggesting expo-\nsure and erosion of these rocks during Miocene times.\n\nPalaeogeothermal gradients in the onshore Algarve Basin range from 52 ?C/km to 24.7 ?C/km with pre-\nMiocene exhumation estimated at 2000e2500 m. The probable age for the removed cover is Upper\nCretaceous to Lower Palaeocene(?) and peak temperatures in the Mesozoic rocks were attained during\nlatest CretaceouseEarly Palaeocene times. Modelled palaeotemperatures suggest that the Jurassic\nentered the oil-window at the beginning of the Cretaceous with peak oil generation in late Cretaceous\ntime.\n\n? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nThe Algarve Basin is a Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary basin\nlocated in southern Portugal, cropping out along the entire south\ncoast from Cape Saint Vincent in the west to the Guadiana river on\nthe PortugueseeSpanish border in the east (Fig. 1). The basin ex-\ntends offshore, where it has been recognized in seismic lines and 5\nhydrocarbon exploration wells (Fig. 1).

Its origin,\nlocation, sedimentary record and evolution during the Mesozoic are\nclosely related to a series of basins that developed during the\nopening of the North and Central Atlantic Ocean, including, for\nexample, the Lusitanian Basin in central Portugal, the Porcupine\nBasin in offshore western Ireland and the Scotian, Whale and Jeanne\nd\u2019Arc basins in offshore eastern Canada (Wilson et al., 1989).\nAlthough the main geological features of the Algarve Basin have been\nsummarised in several publications (e.g. Manuppella et al., 1988;\nTerrinha et al., 2013), none of these discuss organic maturation\n\nmailto:pfernandes@ualg.pt\nhttp://crossmark.dyndns.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2013.06.015&amp;domain=pdf\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/02648172\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/marpetgeo\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2013.06.015\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2013.06.015\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2013.06.015\n\n\nFigure 1.

Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 211\nlevels and thermal history, and their implications for the hydrocar-\nbon exploration. Aspects of the petroleum geology are included in\nunpublished reports produced by oil companies that were active in\nexploration of the offshore basin between the late 1960s and early\n1980s (Chevron,1975; Challenger,1976) and in an unpublished Ph.D.\nthesis (Matias, 2007). However, these summaries contain few data\nregarding the organic maturation levels of the Algarve Basin and\nmainly deal with the stratigraphy, micropalaeontology and model-\nling of exploration wells drilled in the offshore. The few maturation\ndata in these reports are mostly limited to spore colour de-\nterminations. In this work, we present vitrinite reflectance (VR) re-\nsults from 178 rock samples and use these data to estimate their\nthermal maturity, model the thermal history of the Algarve Basin,\nand discuss implications for hydrocarbon exploration, especially in\nthe offshore part of the basin.\n\nThermal history analysis is an indispensable part of any study of\nsedimentary basins and their hydrocarbon source potential. There\nare several methods, both optical and geochemical, which can be\nused to ascertain the temperatures attained by strata during sub-\nsidence and interpret their thermal history. VR is an optical method\nconsidered a reliable indicator of the organic maturation levels of\nsedimentary rocks (Hunt, 1996; Robert, 1988; Tissot and Welte,\n1978; Bordenave et al. 1993). Since organic maturation levels are\nlargely related to temperature, VR is also a good indicator of peak\n(palaeo)temperatures, which accounts for its widespread use in\nbasin analysis and hydrocarbon exploration.\n\nGood age control of the sedimentary successions is also funda-\nmental in basin analysis studies related to hydrocarbon exploration\nand exploitation. This is even more significant in areas where the\nsubsurface geology is mainly recognized by seismic lines (Esso,\n1982a,b; Challenger, 1976; Chevron, 1975) and only by five explo-\nration wells, as is the offshore part of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 1).\nMicropalaeontology and palynology are the staple palaeontological\ntechniques used to determine the age and biostratigraphy in wells\nand boreholes. In this study, in order to calibrate the ages of\noffshore geological units of the Algarve Basin and allow correlation\nwith the onshore geology, two wells, Ruivo and Corvina (Fig. 1),\nwere studied for palynology.\n\n2. Geological background of the Algarve Basin\n\n2.1. Onshore geology\n\nSedimentation in the Algarve Basin was initiated in Late Triassic\ntimes with the deposition of continental red beds and evaporites,\nwhich unconformably overlie folded and faulted Carboniferous\nstrata (Palain, 1976) (Fig. 2). The red bed succession (Silves Sand-\nstones) consists of sandstones and conglomerates at the base,\noverlain by variegated mudstones interbedded with siltstones and\ndolomites (Silves Mudstones e Siltstones and Dolomites). The\nsandstones were deposited in alluvial environments and the mud-\nstones in alluvial to shallow lacustrine environments. At the top of\nthis sequence, to the south of the EeW trending Algibre Fault\n(Fig. 1), there are thick evaporitic deposits, whereas north of this\nmajor structure, the evaporites are virtually absent. The evaporites\nmark the first marine incursions into the basin and yield Early\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Generalized stratigraphy of the onshore Algarve Basin (adapted from Terrinha, 1998, Rocha, 1976, Rey, 2006, 2009, Manuppella, 1988, Antunes and Pais, 1993 and Pais\net al., 2000).\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233212\nJurassic (Hettangian) palynomorphs in the Loul\u00e9 Diapir (Fechner,\n1989). These strata are overlain by volcanic rocks associated with\nthe Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) (Martins et al.,\n2008; Verati et al., 2007) and mark the end of the first phase of\nrifting in the Algarve Basin.\n\nAfter this important magmatic episode, Sinemurian to Tithonian\nmarine carbonate sedimentation became well-established across\nthe Algarve Basin. Within this interval, the vertical movements of\nnorthesouth trending faults caused lateral sedimentary facies\nchanges in the limestone across the basin (Manuppella, 1988;\nManuppella et al., 1988). These facies changes, together with dif-\nferences in thicknesses, allow the division of the Algarve Basin into\nsmall sub-basins, namely, the Western, the BudenseLagoa, and the\nEastern sub-basins (Fig. 1) (Manuppella et al., 1988).\n\nThree main sedimentary cycles, separated by regional un-\nconformities or hiatuses, are recognized in the Jurassic (Sinemurian\nto Tithonian) marine carbonates of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 2). These\ncycles are related either to global sea level variations or to regional\ntectonic events (Mouterde et al., 1971; Manuppella et al., 1988;\nTerrinha et al., 2002). The first cycle extends from Sinemurian to\nlower Toarcian (Fig. 2), and consists mainly of dolomitised lime-\nstones that occupy a large area north of the Algibre Fault in\nthe central Algarve. In the Western Sub-Basin, less dolomitised\nlimestones (Cape S. Vincent and Praia do Belixe Dolomites) have\nyielded Pliensbachian to Lower Toarcian ammonites (Rocha, 1976;\nDommergues et al., 2011). Late Sinemurian foraminifera identified\nin the lower beds of the Picavessa Dolomites confirm the age of this\ncycle in the Eastern Sub-Basin (Azer\u00eado et al., 2003).\n\nThe second cycle corresponds to the Middle Jurassic (Fig. 2) and\nis well-exposed at Mareta Beach in the Western Sub-Basin. At this\nlocation it is represented by a ca. 140 m thick succession at the base\nof which are coral bioherms with karstified tops that are filled and\ncovered by upper Bajocian limestones with Zoophycus and by mid\nBathonian marls (Praia da Mareta Marls). The coral bioherms are\nnot dated directly and their age therefore remains problematic.\nHowever, the lack of bioherms in the Sinemurian to lower Toarcian\nsuccession in the Western Sub-Basin, together with the absence of\nmid to upper Toarcian strata in the same region, suggested to Rocha\n(1976) that the most probable age for the Praia da Mareta Bioherms\nwas Aalenian to early Bajocian, and that the karstification episode\nwas pre-late Bajocian. Overlying the mid Bathonian marls are more\ngrey marls that grade upwards into marly limestones that have\nbeen affected by several slump events (Gibling and Stuart, 1988;\nRocha, 1976). Ammonite faunas and dinoflagellates indicate a Cal-\nlovian age for this part of the succession (Borges et al., 2011, 2012;\nRocha, 1976). In the Eastern Sub-Basin, this cycle is represented by\n\n\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 213\nBajocian to lower Callovian marls and marly limestones that crop\nout in the cores of regional anticlines north of Faro (Guilhim) and\nTavira (Borges et al., 2012; Marques and Rocha, 1988a, 1988b). The\nestablishment of lower Callovian marlemarly limestone succes-\nsions across the Algarve Basin suggests that uniform sedimentary\nconditions prevailed in Callovian time, possibly due to an increase\nin the rate of subsidence and an associated transgressive episode.\n\nThe beds at the base of the third sedimentary cycle rest un-\nconformably on gently-folded Callovian marly limestones and\nmarls (e.g. at Cilheta Beach in the Western Sub-Basin). This un-\nconformity marks an important tectonic event that is observed\nthroughout Iberia (Mouterde et al., 1971). Immediately above the\nunconformity are limestones in the Western Sub-Basin (Praia do\nTonel Limestones) and limestoneemarl successions in the Eastern\nSub-Basin (Peral Limestones and Marls) (Fig. 2). Both lithological\nunits yielded ammonites of mid Oxfordian age. These beds are\noverlain by a thick succession (over 500 m in the Eastern Sub-Basin)\nof Upper Jurassic (mid Oxfordian to Tithonian) interbedded lime-\nstones, marls, bioherms and dolomites (e.g. Manuppella et al.,1987;\nOliveira, 1992). Sedimentary conditions became uniform in both\nsub-basins in the Tithonian with the deposition of shallow water\nlimestones (Fonta\u00ednhas Limestones with Anchispirocyclina lusitan-\nica) (Fig. 2).\n\nThe Lower Cretaceous sedimentary interval is represented by a\nmixed carbonate and siliciclastic succession (Rey, 1983, 2006,\n2009), which attains its maximum thickness (ca. 1500 m) in cen-\ntral Algarve in the Eastern Sub-Basin. At its base are Berriasian\nmarls and dolomites that rest conformably on Tithonian limestones\n(e.g. at Ponta da Alm\u00e1dena in the Western Sub-Basin) (Fig. 2). In the\neastern Sub-Basin this contact is not observed. The Berriasian strata\nare followed by Valanginian to Barremian marls, dolomites, sand-\nstones and mudstones that were deposited in nearshore and con-\ntinental settings. This part of the Lower Cretaceous succession is\nbetter represented in the Eastern Sub-Basin. During the Aptian to\nFigure 3. Lithological logs of the offshore wells Ruivo and Corvina with sample position and\nwindow sensu Peters and Cassa (1994).\nAlbian interval, depositional conditions became more uniform\nacross the basin, resulting in the accumulation of variegated muds\nof possible lagoonal origin (the Aptian Luz Marls) followed by\ntransgressive limestones and marls (the lower Albian Porto de M\u00f3s\nLimestones and Marls). Upper Albian to Cenomanian strata are only\nknown in the Eastern Sub-Basin and are represented by shallow\nwater limestones interbedded with marls and dolomites.\n\nDuring the Late CretaceousePalaeocene(?), a major uplift\nepisode occurred, related to Alpine tectonism and the emplacement\nof the Late Cretaceous (Campanian, ca. 72 Ma) Monchique Syenite\n(Fig. 1) (Terrinha et al., 2002; Miranda et al., 2009). Although the\nmain batholith of the Monchique Syenite only intrudes greywackes\nand shales of Pennsylvanian age, minor intrusions of the Monchique\nSyenite Massif Dyke Swarm intrude the Algarve Basin Mesozoic\nsuccession, especially in the Western Sub-Basin (Martins, 1999;\nMartins and Munh\u00e1, 1993). As a consequence, no Upper Creta-\nceous to Palaeogene strata are found in the onshore, exhumed\nAlgarve Basin. After this event, sedimentation only resumed during\nthe Miocene (Pais et al., 2000), with bioclastic limestones that grade\nupwards into silts and fine sands, which unconformably overlie the\nJurassic and Lower Cretaceous strata.\n\n2.2. Offshore exploration wells\n\n2.2.1. Ruivo\nThis well reached a depth of ca. 2134 m below sea-bed (Fig. 3).\n\nThe upper 876 m consists of limestones, sandstones and argilla-\nceous siltstones assigned to the MioceneeOligocene interval\n(Chevron, 1975). From 876 to 1087 m depth, sandstones and mud-\nstones lacking any stratigraphically-useful fossils were intersected\nand tentatively attributed to the Upper Cretaceous (Turonian)\n(Chevron,1975). The interval between the 1087 and 1909 m consists\nof interbedded marls and limestones with microfossils suggesting a\nMiddle Jurassic (Callovian) age. The deepest 225 m of the well, from\nVR values with respective standard deviations (horizontal bars). Shaded area is the oil\n\n\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233214\n1909 to 2134 m, consists of evaporites (halite and gypsum) with\nintercalated minor mudstones beds. By lithostratigraphic correla-\ntionwith the succession in the onshore Algarve Basin, this interval is\nattributed to the Lower Jurassic (Hettangian).\n\n2.2.2. Corvina\nThe Corvina well reached a depth of ca. 2900 m (Fig. 3). The top\n\n1100 m consists of limestones, siltstones and mudstones assigned to\nthe MioceneeOligocene. The interval between 1100 and ca. 2700 m\ncomprises a thick succession of limestones, marls and dolomites\nattributed to the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic on the basis of\ncalcareous nanofossils and foraminifera (Challenger, 1976). Our\npalynological data from this well interval partially contradict this age\ndetermination (see Palynological results). The interval from 2700 m\nto T.D. consists mainly of limestones lacking any stratigraphically-\nuseful fossils.\n\n2.3. Stratigraphic correlation across the Algarve Basin\n\nFrom the Lower Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous, one of the\nmain features of the onshore Algarve Basin was its division into\nsmall sub-basins by synsedimentary faults (Manuppella, 1988;\nManuppella et al., 1988). One of the main consequences of this\npartitioning was differing subsidence rates in the sub-basins. The\nlateral correlation of the Mesozoic Series across the onshore\nAlgarve Basin and its tentative correlation with the two offshore\nwells studied (Ruivo and Corvina) are summarised in Figure 4. The\nFigure 4. Lateral correlation of the measured stratigraphic sections in the Western (Sagrese\noffshore wells Ruivo and Corvina (adapted from Manuppella, 1988). Datum for the onshore s\n91 m water depth and Corvina well 189 m water depth).\nkey measured section for the Western Sub-Basin in the Sagrese\nLagos area attains a maximum thickness of ca. 1200 m, whereas a\nmaximum thickness of ca. 3500 m was measured in the Faro area in\nthe Eastern Sub-Basin. The greater thickness in the latter is mainly\ndue to its thick Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous succession,\nwhich is more attenuated in the other two areas that characterize\nthe Eastern Sub-Basin (Albufeira and Tavira), and in the Western\nSub-Basin, where subsidence rates were more constant throughout\nthe Mesozoic.\n\nThe stratigraphy of offshore Algarve Basin revealed by the wells\nRuivo and Corvina shows more hiatuses when compared with the\nonshore part of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 4), precluding age and lith-\nological correlation of the stratigraphic units between the two parts\nof the basin. However, it is clear from analysis of the two wells that\nmajor unconformities are present in the offshore which are not\nobserved in the onshore succession of the basin. In well Ruivo, the\nbulk of the Jurassic succession is of Callovian age (see Palynological\nresults section). The basal beds were intruded in places by Hettan-\ngian evaporites (possibly a major diapir structure), and the upper\npart is unconformably overlain by Upper Cretaceous sandstones. In\nthe offshore well Corvina, a very thick Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian)\nsuccession of over 1000 m was penetrated (see Palynological results\nsection), which is unconformably overlain by, an equally thick (ca.\n1000 m) succession consisting of limestones, sandstones and\nmudstones of Miocene age. Exceptionally thick Upper Jurassic and\nMiocene successions such as those observed in the well Corvina, are\nunknown either in the onshore part of the basin or in the well Ruivo.\nLagos) and Eastern Sub-Basins (Albufeira, Faro and Tavira) of the Algarve Basin and the\nections is the base of the Miocene and for the offshore wells is the sea level (Ruivo well\n\n\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 215\n3. Materials and methods\n\nVR was determined from 178 samples in order to determine the\nregional maturity and to elucidate the thermal evolution of the\nAlgarve Basin (Tables 1 and 2). The samples analysed in this study\nwere obtained from various sources: outcrops, two groundwater\nexploration boreholes (NR and JK), the Loul\u00e9 Salt Mine, and two\noffshore hydrocarbon exploration wells (Ruivo and Corvina) (Figs. 1\nand 3). Figures 5a, 6a, 7a and 8a show the geographical distribution\nof the outcrop samples analysed. The lithologies used were grey to\ndark grey marls, non-calcareous mudstones, siltstones and clay-\nrich evaporites. Two thin coal lenses in the late Jurassic Peral\nLimestones and Marls at Cerro da Rocha (Table 1, sample 112) and in\nthe early Cretaceous Mudstones and Sandstones (Weald Facies)\nnear Tunes (Table 1, sample 59) were also sampled.\n\nNot all stratigraphic intervals in the Algarve Basin contain li-\nthologies that are suitable for maturation studies. The Upper\nTriassic to Lower Jurassic (Hettangian) red beds are generally poor\nin organic matter and maturation results from this stratigraphic\ninterval are confined to a few mudstone beds above the Silves\nSandstones and clay-rich evaporites in the Loul\u00e9 and Albufeira di-\napirs (Figs. 1 and 2). Pliensbachian to Toarcian maturation results\nare confined to the Sagres area in the Western Sub-Basin (Fig. 2). In\nthe Eastern Sub-Basin this stratigraphic interval is dominated by\ndolomitised limestones of the Picavessa and Boavista Dolomites\n(Fig. 2), which proved to be barren. The majority of data from the\nMiddle Jurassic is from the Callovian marlelimestone successions\nwhich are widespread in the Algarve Basin (Praia da Mareta Marls\nand Telheiro Marls) (Fig. 2). Most of the Upper Jurassic maturation\nresults are from the marlelimestone successions that straddle the\nOxfordianeKimmeridgian boundary in the central Algarve (Peral\nLimestones and Marls) (Fig. 2). Lower Cretaceous maturation re-\nsults were recorded essentially from Berriasian to Barremian\nshallow marine to continental deposits and from the widespread\nAptian to Albian lagoon-nearshore to shallow continental shelf\nsedimentary facies of the Luz Mudstones and Porto de M\u00f3s Lime-\nstones and Marls (Fig. 2).\n\nThe Ruivo and Corvina wells were drilled for hydrocarbon\nexploration in the offshore part of the Algarve Basin by Chevron and\nChallenger in 1975 and 1976 respectively. The stratigraphic position\nof the samples analysed in the wells and the maturation results are\nshown in Figure 3 and Table 2, respectively. The cuttings sampled\nwere marls, mudstones and siltstones. It was not possible to sample\nthe two wells systematically due to the lack of preserved material\nthrough large intervals and to a lesser extent, to the presence of\nunsuitable lithologies (crystalline limestones). The lithological and\nbiostratigraphic information provided here is from unpublished\nreports (Chevron, 1975; Challenger, 1976) and from palynological\ninvestigations completed during this study.\n\n3.1. Extraction techniques and methods of study\n\nOrganic residues were extracted from the rock samples and\ncuttings using standard cold hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric\nacid (HF) techniques. The organic residues used for the maturation\nstudies were then mounted and polished using a method adapted\nfrom that described by Hillier and Marshall (1988). Part of the\norganic residue extracted from the samples was also mounted on\nslides for spore fluorescence and spore colour determination. Part\nof the organic residues from the Ruivo and Corvina well samples\nwas also mounted for palynology.\n\nMean random vitrinite reflectance (%Rr) was the vitrinite\nreflectance (VR) parameter chosen for maturation assessment of the\nAlgarve Basin because the mounting technique used provides non-\noriented vitrinite particles and also because %Rr is the most widely\nused organic maturation parameter in the oil industry and is readily\ncorrelated with other maturity parameters. VR measurements on all\nof the samples were made in the University of the Algarve using an\nOlympus BX 51 microscope with a 50? oil-immersion objective lens\nand equipped with a black and white digital camera. The black and\nwhite (8-bit) digital images of vitrinite particles were analysed us-\ning a graphical tool, named VITRINITE, that runs within the Mirone\nSuite (Luis, 2007) and calibrates the scale of 256 grey levels with\nstandards of known reflectivity (Fernandes et al., 2010). The\nreflectance values of the standards used in this study were: 0.428%,\n0.595%, 1.715%, 3.15% and 5.37%. VR was measured in incident light\nwith a wavelength of 546 nm and immersion oil with a refractive\nindex of 1.518 at 20 ?C room temperature.\n\nWhen possible, 100 random reflectances were measured across\nthe slides and their arithmetic mean and standard deviation were\ncalculated (Tables 1 and 2). The arithmetic mean was considered to\nbe the true Rr for the sample. The accuracy of vitrinite reflectance\nmeasurements depends on the precision of the reflectance micro-\nscope and the number of grains measured. Mackowsky (1982)\nregarded 100 measurements as a statistically valid size for a pop-\nulation and noted that 900 measurements would be required to\ngive three times the accuracy. McCormack (1998) concluded that\nonly 97 measurements are necessary for each sample to have a\nprecision of 0.1% with a 95% confidence interval with a standard\ndeviation of 0.5%Rr. If the number of measurements decreases to 30,\nthe same confidence interval and standard deviation implies a\nprecision of 0.18%. Therefore, the minimum number of VR mea-\nsurements regarded as statically valid in this study was 30. Not all\nsamples were rich in indigenous vitrinite and in some cases, the\nreflectance of fewer than 30 particles was measured. However,\nmost of these relatively vitrinite poor samples belonged to strati-\ngraphic intervals that also included samples with VR measure-\nments based on more than 30 particles. In these cases and in order\nto have a VR value characteristic of the stratigraphic sections, the\nVR values measured from all samples of the same stratigraphic\nsections were combined. In section 6. Organic maturation results,\nthe statistical procedures that were used in the treatment of VR\nresults from the same stratigraphic units are described. Tables 1\nand 2 show all organic maturation results, both measured and\nstatistically treated. Figure 9 shows representative VR histograms\nfor the different stratigraphic units onshore and in the offshore\nwells. The analysis of the VR results shown in some of the histo-\ngrams is discussed in the following sections.\n\nFluorescence microscopy is used to differentiate source rocks\nfrom non-source rocks and to estimate the level of maturation from\nfluorescence colours and spectra (Van Gijzel,1967,1971,1975,1979;\nMcPhilemy, 1988). Organic maturation causes a gradual shift in\nfluorescence colours (red shift) from the shorter to the longer\nwavelengths, that is, blue and green to yellow, orange and finally\nred. Of all the sub-macerals of the liptiniteeexinite group, sporinite\nis the one that shows the most consistent changes in fluorescence\ncolour spectra and intensity with increasing organic maturation.\nUnder fluorescence excitation, it changes colour from green\nthrough yellow to orange and finally red, with increasing maturity\nto the top of the oil-window, after which is no longer fluoresces.\nDespite some differences in fluorescence colours and intensity for\ndifferent spore taxa, spore fluorescence is an important parameter\nof organic maturation for low-rank material.\n\nFor this study, qualitative spore fluorescence colour analyses of\nthe samples were completed in the Department of Geology, Trinity\nCollege Dublin using a Leitz Dialux 20 microscope with Ploemopak\n2.4 incident fluorescent tube with a violet and blue \u00fe12 filter block,\ngiving a wavelength band of 390e490 nm. This system was allowed\nto stabilize for 30 min prior to any observation of the fluorescence\nproperties of the samples.\n\n\n\nTable 1\nOrganic maturation results and calculated palaeotemperatures (?C) (calculated using method described by Barker, 1988) for the onshore samples of the Algarve Basin.

Di-\nnoflagellates were the most abundant palynomorphs, followed by\npollen, prasynopytes, internal linings of foraminifera and acritarchs\n(indeterminate and Micrhystridium spp.).\n\nThe dinoflagellate cyst assemblage recovered from samples\nCo1eCo4, confirms the Miocene age for this interval that was\ninitially provided by other microfossil groups (Challenger, 1976).\n\nThe 12 samples between 1806 m and 2891 m yielded a\nmoderately diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblage. The species\nEndoscrinium luridum, Hystrichosphaerina orbifera, Systematophora\nspp., Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta (Plate 1, c) and\nGonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. jurassica are typical of the Oxfordian.\nThe chorate cysts Compositosphaeridium polonicum and Rigaudella\naemula are good markers for the mid Callovianemid Oxfordian\ninterval, the latter being more common from the late Callovian\nonwards, and becoming extinct in mid Oxfordian times. Ctenido-\ndinium ornatum (Plate 1, e) is a species that is typical of the late\nCallovianemid Oxfordian interval, whereas the last occurrence of\nWanaea acollaris (Plate 1, k) is at the boundary between the Cal-\nlovian and the Oxfordian stages. Small numbers of specimens of\nStephanelytron redcliffense (Plate 1, i) were identified in sample Co5.\nThe occurrence of this taxon is limited to the Callovianeearly\nKimmeridgian. Therefore, the most likely age for the interval be-\ntween 1806 and 2891 m is early to mid Oxfordian (e.g. Riding, 2005;\nRiding and Thomas,1992) (Table 4) and not the Lower Cretaceous to\nJurassic intervals as proposed in the report Challenger (1976).\n\n5. Composition of the organic matter\n\nThis section is not a comprehensive account of the nature and\ncomposition of the organic matter in the Algarve Basin. Our goal is\nto describe the main trends observed in the composition of the\norganic matter in the basin.\n\nAlthough the stratigraphic succession of the Algarve Basin re-\ncords a great variety of sedimentary environments spanning a\nconsiderable time, the composition of the dispersed organic matter\ndoes not vary greatly between the different lithological units.\nOverall, the dispersed organic matter in the Algarve Basin is\ndominated by terrestrially-derived particles such as phytoclasts,\n\n\n\nPlate 1.

Black phytoclasts (inertinite) become more\nimportant in the Cretaceous strata, possibly related to environ-\nmental degradation by aridity, enhanced erosion rates, reworking\nand oxidation of the organic matter in the continental source areas\n(Tyson, 1993, 1995). Pollen and spores are also very common and\nwell-preserved, with the gymnosperm pollen Classopolis classoides\noccurring commonly throughout the whole Mesozoic succession of\nthe Algarve Basin. Marine palynomorphs (dinoflagellates and\nacritarchs) are not distributed evenly through the Algarve Basin\nsuccession and never dominate the dispersed organic matter.\nHowever, dinoflagellates are common and are invaluable strati-\ngraphically in the Bajocian to Callovian marlelimestone intervals of\nthe basin (Borges et al., 2011, 2012).\n\nAmorphous organic matter (AOM) is never a major constituent\nof the dispersed organic matter in any of the samples analysed, on\naverage constituting 15e20%. Even in the more marine marle\nlimestone succession with ammonoids, AOM rarely exceeds 50% of\ntotal organic matter. Pyrite is common and appears as inclusions,\nnormally associated with palynomorphs and AOM.\n6. Organic maturation results\n\nIn order to characterize the true thicknesses of the sections\nstudied and the accurate position of the VR values measured within\nthe stratigraphic succession, the Algarve Basin was divided into 4\nareas, each with its own stratigraphy. Although the general strati-\ngraphic architecture of the Algarve Basin is similar in the 4 areas,\nthis division reflects the partition of the basin and the lateral\nchanges in thickness across the basin more accurately (Fig. 4). It\nalso facilitates better understanding of its thermal history. Thus, we\nfollow the partition of the Algarve Basin published by Manuppella\net al. (1988) with the key measured stratigraphic successions that\ncharacterize each sub-basin, integrated with our own field\nmeasured sections. The 4 areas considered are: SagreseLagos,\nAlbufeira, Faro and Tavira. The first area belongs to the Western\nSub-Basin whereas the other three areas belong to the Eastern Sub-\nBasin. Figure 1 shows the limits of the areas considered and\nFigures 5a, 6a, 7a and 8a the geographical location of the samples\nstudied of each area. The VR values shown in the stratigraphic\ncolumns for each area are the mean values of all samples from the\ntime interval in the area considered (Table 1). The VR mean (med.)\nand standard deviation (std.) for each stratigraphic interval in the\ndifferent areas were calculated from the equations:\n\nmed: \u00bc\nX\n\n\u00f0xini\u00de=\nX\n\nnt\n\nstd: \u00bc O\u00f0variance\u00de\n\nwhere, xi is the mean of each sample, ni the number of vitrinite\nparticles of each sample and nt the total number of vitrinite parti-\ncles measured for each stratigraphic interval considered in the four\nareas of the Algarve Basin (SagreseLagos, Albufeira, Faro and\nTavira) (Table 1).\n\nThe position of the calculated VR value in the stratigraphic\ncolumn for each area was placed at approximately the middle of the\nlithostratigraphic units, when more than three VR samples were\nmeasured. In stratigraphic sections with only one sample\nmeasured, its position in the stratigraphic column was the\nmeasured thickness between the sample and the closest strati-\ngraphic boundary, either the base or the top contact. For example,\nin the SagreseLagos area, VR was measured from 20 samples in the\nCallovian Praia da Mareta Marls. The calculated mean and standard\n\n\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 225\ndeviation value of these 20 samples are 0.89% and 0.18%, respec-\ntively (Table 1). Since this unit is approximately 70 m thick (Rocha,\n1976; Borges et al., 2011) and through this thickness the VR values\ndoes not change significantly, the position of the calculated mean\nVR value was placed at the mid point of the unit, i.e., at ca. 35 m\nfrom both the top (the plane of unconformity between the Middle\nand Upper Jurassic) and the base of this unit (the contact between\nthe Praia da Mareta Marls and the underlying Praia da Mareta Marls\nwith Zoophycus) (Fig. 2). In the same area, the three samples\nstudied from the mid Oxfordian Praia do Tonel Limestones (samples\n20, 21 and 22; Table 1) have a calculated VR mean of 0.81% and a\nstandard deviation of 0.10%. The samples are from the same outcrop\nwhich is positioned 40 m above the Middle JurassiceUpper Jurassic\nunconformity in the stratigraphic column.\n\nThe following comments apply to the VR results from all Algarve\nBasin samples, regardless the age of strata or geographic position\nwhere the samples are grouped only in terms of the main sedi-\nmentary cycles (Upper TriassiceHettangian, Lower Jurassic, Middle\nJurassic, Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous). There is a clear\ncorrelation between Rr values and the age of the strata. Rr increases\nwith the age of the rocks as follows: Lower Cretaceous 0.58e0.69%;\nUpper Jurassic 0.78e0.88%; Middle Jurassic 0.85e0.95%; Lower\nJurassic 0.95e0.99% and Upper TriassiceHettangian 0.94e1.15%. In\ncalculating mean Rr for the Lower Cretaceous rocks, some of the\nvalues measured from the Praia da Luz Marls and Porto de M\u00f3s\nLimestones and Marls in the SagreseLagos area were not used,\nbecause they are regarded as clearly anomalous (see section\nbelow).\n\n6.1. SagreseLagos\n\nThe SagreseLagos area corresponds to the part of the Algarve\nBasin between Cape St. Vincent and Lagos, together with the Car-\nrapateira Outlier, located approximately 20 km north of Sagres,\nwhich is considered a northern extension of the main outcrop\n(Fig. 1). VR was measured from Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous\n(Albian) rocks (Fig. 5a). The composite stratigraphic thickness for\nthis area is ca. 1300 m (Manuppella, 1988; Rocha, 1976). Figure 5b\nshows the mean Rr and standard deviation values for the different\nstratigraphic levels sampled plotted against the depth of burial. The\nmean Rr increases from 0.58% in the Albian Porto de M\u00f3s Lime-\nstones and Marls, to 1.07% in the Upper Triassic Silves Mudstones.\nSome VR values from samples collected between 50 and 200 m\nfrom the intrusion contact at Praia da Luz and Praia de Porto de\nM\u00f3s, are anomalously high for rocks of this age (Aptian/Albian) and\nare interpreted as the product of heating by the Upper Cretaceous\nigneous intrusive rocks that outcrop at Ponta das Ferrarias (Fig. 5a).\nThe effects of this rapid heating event are shown in the VR histo-\ngrams of the samples 1 and 14 (Fig. 9a and Table 1) belonging to the\nsame stratigraphic interval (Porto de M\u00f3s Limestones and Marls).\nSample 14 was collected from a bed less than 1 m from the contact\nwith the intrusion at Ponta das Ferrarias, whereas sample 1 was\ncollected from an outcrop far from any intrusives. VR increases\nfrom 0.52%Rr in sample 1 to 1.68%Rr in sample 14. Spore fluores-\ncence shows yellow colours in sample 1, but spores in sample 14 do\nnot show any fluorescence, which is consistent with the VR results.\nTAI also show the effect of heating, changing from values of 2 in\nsample 1 to a TAI value of 4 in sample 14 (Table 1). The effects of\nLate Cretaceous igneous intrusions on the maturation of the\nSagreseLagos area are more pronounced than predicted and\nrequire further study.\n\nSpore fluorescence and spore colour were also observed in the\nsamples analysed and, in general, agree well with the VR results.\nFluorescence changes from yellow in the Upper Cretaceous sam-\nples, to dark yellow/orange in the Middle Jurassic, and finally to\norange in the Upper TriassiceLower Jurassic samples. TAI for the\nsame stratigraphic interval increases from 2/2\u00fe in the Lower\nCretaceous to 2\u00fe/3? in the Middle Jurassic and 3?/3 in the Upper\nTriassic (Table 1).\n\n6.2. Albufeira\n\nThe outcrops in this area are located between the town of Silves\nand the S\u00e3o Marcos da SerraeQuarteira Fault (Figs. 1 and 6a). The\nstratigraphic succession is ca. 3000 m thick and consists of rocks\nthat range in age from Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous. Some of\nthe key outcrops in this area are located around the coastal town of\nAlbufeira and include the outcrop of the Albufeira Diapir. This\nstructure is situated adjacent to the EeW trending Baleeira Fault,\n\u201can inverted Jurassic normal fault, which was intruded by the\nAlbufeira Salt Diapir during extension of the basin\u201d (Terrinha,1998).\nVR, spore fluorescence and colour were measured from Upper\nTriassic mudstones situated in the S. Bartolomeu de MessineseVale\nFuzeiros area, from Hettangian evaporites of the Albufeira Diapir,\nfrom mid OxfordianeKimmeridgian marls cropping out near\nAlbufeira town, from inland Lower Cretaceous mudstones and marl\noutcrops between Paderne and Algoz and from the coastal section\nat Praia dos Arrifes (Fig. 6a).\n\nVR increases progressively with increasing age of the strata\n(Fig. 6b), from a mean value of 0.60% in the Aptian Praia da Luz\nMarls to a mean value of 1.0% in the Late Triassic Silves Mudstones\ne Siltstones and Dolomites. Sample 64 (Table 1) of Lower Creta-\nceous contains clearly reworked vitrinite particles (Fig. 9f) with VR\nabove 0.8%Rr. This VR value was adjusted to include only the\nindigenous vitrinite particles.\n\nSpore fluorescence is consistent with VR and with fluorescence\ncolour and intensity. It also gradually changes with the increasing\nage of the rocks. The samples from the Upper Cretaceous are\ncharacterized by intense bright yellow spore fluorescence, whereas\ndark orange and orange fluorescence colours were recorded in the\nUpper Triassic and Hettangian samples, respectively (Table 1). TAI\nvalues increase from 2\u00fe in the Upper Cretaceous to 3? in the Upper\nTriassic.\n\n6.3. Faro\n\nFigure 7a shows the VR results for the Faro area, which corre-\nsponds to a large area in the central e east Algarve, south of the\nAlgibre Fault, where Upper Jurassic carbonates crop out extensively\n(Fig.1). The stratigraphic succession in this area is the thickest in all\nthe Algarve Basin at ca. 3500 m, suggesting that this area was the\ndepocentre of the onshore part of the basin (Fig. 4). Of particular\nsignificance in this area are the Lower Cretaceous sediments that\nare more than 1000 m thick and which extend up into the Cen-\nomanian (Rey, 2009) indicating that sedimentation in the Algarve\nBasin continued through Late Cretaceous time.\n\nSamples for maturation studies were collected from Late Triassic\n(?) e Hettangian evaporites in the underground Loul\u00e9 Salt mine,\nfrom early Callovian marls in the disused Telheiro quarry, from\nnumerous Upper Jurassic (late Oxfordian to Tithonian) marl out-\ncrops and also from outcrops of Albianeearly Cenomanian (?)\nmarls. The ages of the Cretaceous samples are not very well con-\nstrained but field relations suggest a stratigraphic position close to\nthe top of the Cretaceous succession (Fig. 7b). A core of mudstone\nfrom depth 46 m in a shallow groundwater exploration borehole\n(JK) was also sampled, providing additional Early Cretaceous VR\ndata.\n\nVR values from this area show a linear increase with the age of\nthe strata with a mean of 0.69% for the Early Cretaceous rocks and\n1.02% for the Hettangian evaporites of the Loul\u00e9 Diapir (Fig. 7b). The\n\n\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233226\nobserved spore fluorescence is consistent with the VR results with\nfluorescence ranging from intense bright yellow in the majority of\nthe of the Lower Cretaceous samples, to orange e dark orange in\nthe Middle Jurassic and Hettangian. TAI values from the Faro area\nincrease from 2/2\u00fe in the Upper Cretaceous rocks to a 3? in the\nHettangian evaporites of the Loul\u00e9 Diapir (Table 1).\n\n6.4. Tavira\n\nThis area corresponds essentially to the ca. 1800 m thick section\nthat crops out north of Tavira, along the banks of the S\u00e9qua river\n(Fig 8a). In this section, maturation studies were completed on\nsamples of Callovian marls, Kimmeridgian to Tithonian marls and\nUpper TriassiceHettangian mudstones. In addition, two Upper\nTriassic mudstone core samples from a shallow groundwater\nexploration borehole (NR) were sampled (NR1 and NR2 at depths of\n156 and 158 m respectively).\n\nVR results show a similar pattern to the other three areas. Rr\nvalues increase linearly with age and depth of burial from a mean Rr\nof 0.82% in the Lower Cretaceous to 1.10% in the Upper Triassic, near\nthe base of the local succession (Fig. 8b). Spore fluorescence and\ncolour results (Table 1) from the Upper Triassic and Callovian rocks\nare fully consistent with the organic maturation levels determined\nby VR. Orange spore fluorescence colours and TAI of 3? were\nrecorded in the Callovian samples. Orange spore fluorescence col-\nours and TAI of 3/3 were also observed in the Upper Triassic\nsamples.\n\nIn a single sample collected from the Miocene argillaceous\nsiltstones of the Cacela Formation, near Ribeira de Cacela, a Rr value\nof 0.42% was determined. This value is considerably lower than the\nvalues measured for the Mesozoic rocks and lies off the regression\nline defined by the Mesozoic samples (Fig. 8b). Although this result\nis only from a single sample, it is significant to understanding the\ntiming of maturation for the Mesozoic succession in the Algarve\nBasin.\n\n6.5. Offshore wells\n\nThe offshore wells, Ruivo and Corvina, intersected different\nMesozoic stratigraphic intervals in the Algarve Basin succession. In\nthe Ruivo well, a thick Middle Jurassic section (Callovian) overlies\nHettangian evaporites, whereas in the Corvina well, a thick Upper\nJurassic (Oxfordian) section was encountered (Fig. 3). The Mesozoic\nstrata in both wells are unconformably overlain by Tertiary clastic\nrocks. This unconformity is also observed in the onshore part of the\nAlgarve Basin where Miocene bioclastic limestones of the Lagose\nPortim\u00e3o Formation generally rest unconformably on rocks of\nCretaceous, Jurassic or locally Carboniferous age. The presence of\nHettangian evaporites at the base of the Ruivo well indicates the\npresence of a diapir that intruded the Middle Jurassic rocks.\n\nFigure 3 shows the VR results from in both wells. Unfortunately,\nthe lack of continuous sampling precluded the estimation of\nmaturation gradients and detailed consideration of the thermal\nhistory of the offshore part of the Algarve Basin. In the well Ruivo,\nVR was measured in Callovian and Hettangian rocks from the lower\nsection in the well. In this interval Rr ranges from 0.94% to 1.06%\nindicating that this part of the well section is within the late oil-\nwindow. The orange to dark yellow spore fluorescence colours\nand TAI ranging from 2\u00fe to 3? (Table 2) that were recorded from\nthis interval confirm this conclusion. Moreover, the VR values\ndetermined compare closely with the Middle Jurassic sections in\nthe onshore part of the Algarve Basin, especially the Middle Jurassic\nsections of the Eastern Sub-Basin.\n\nThe VR of the Tertiary sample analysed at the top of the well (R1)\nis complex. This sample shows two different populations of\nvitrinite: one with a mean VR value similar to that of the Mesozoic\nrocks (0.94%Rr) interpreted as reworked, and a second with a much\nlower mean VR value of 0.47%Rr, regarded as the true indigenous\nvitrinite population for this stratigraphic interval (Fig. 9). Although\nindigenous vitrinite is rare in this sample (only 4 grains were\nmeasured, Table 2), it is rich in palynomorphs, together with the\nother Miocene samples (R2 and R3), whose fluorescence and TAI\ncolours are consistent with the two VR maturity populations in\nsample R1. These samples show two different populations of\npalynomorphs, one consisting essentially of spores with brown to\ndark brown exines (TAI: 2\u00fe/3?) and showing dark yellow and or-\nange fluorescence colours; the second consisting of spores, bissa-\ncate pollen and dinoflagellates with transparent to light yellow\nexine colours (TAI: 1/1\u00fe) and intense blue/green fluorescence. This\nclearly indicates the presence of an important reworked population\nof palynomorphs and possibly also of vitrinite, since the indigenous\npopulation of palynomorphs (the Miocene dinoflagellates prove\nthe age of this interval) indicates immaturity with regard to the oil-\nwindow. Therefore, the highest VR population of sample R1 in this\nwell interval is interpreted as representing a reworked vitrinite\npopulation. The possibility of the lowest VR population being caved\nmaterial can be discounted because the samples are from the upper\npart of the well with negligible overlying strata.\n\nIn the well Corvina (Fig. 3), the most extensively sampled in-\nterval comprises ca. 600 m of mid Oxfordian marls between 1800\nand 2400 m. VR was also measured in Miocene mudstones and\nfrom a marl sample located at T.D. VR for all Upper Jurassic samples\nranged between 1.07%Rr and 1.2%Rr and does not show any clear\nincrease with depth of burial. The values determined indicate a\nposition in late oil-window. Palynomorph fluorescence in this in-\nterval varies from dark yellow, orange to dark orange, whereas TAIs\nare 2\u00fe/3?/3. These two organic maturation parameters suggest a\nslightly lower maturation level than the VR results. The VR results\nfrom the Upper Jurassic samples in this well are also higher than\nthose from the same stratigraphic levels in the onshore part of the\nbasin, especially in the Eastern Sub-Basin.\n\nVR in the Miocene sample Co1, at the top of the well, shows a\nbimodal population of vitrinite, a situation very similar to that\nfound in the Miocene samples of the Ruivo well. The VR value of the\nindigenous population is 0.42%Rr, whereas the reworked popula-\ntion is 0.91%Rr. The other Miocene samples in this well (Table 2)\nonly have reworked vitrinite populations. However, as observed in\nthe well Ruivo, they contain abundant palynomorphs which can be\ndivided in two populations on the basis of their fluorescence and\nspore colours. A population of light-coloured palynomorphs that\nincludes the dinoflagellate species that provides the age for this\ninterval of the well, has intense blue/green fluorescence colours\nand TAI of 1/1\u00fe/2?, indicating immaturity with regard to the oil-\nwindow. Dark-brown to brown palynomorphs (spores) are also\npresent showing dark yellow, orange and dark orange fluorescence\nand a TAI of 2\u00fe/3/3?. The organic maturation results from the\nMiocene strata in both wells are very similar, with two populations\nof organic particles, one indigenous with low maturation levels and\na second with reworked material indicating higher maturation\nlevels.\n\n7. Thermal history\n\n7.1. Palaeogeothermal gradients estimates\n\nThe VR results from the Mesozoic rocks of the onshore Algarve\nBasin indicate that there is a clear relationship between maturity\nand age (Fig. 5a, 6a, 7a and 8a) with maturation levels increasing\nwith increasing age of the strata, suggesting that burial was the\nmain process controlling organic maturation. Overall, the results\n\n\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 227\nstrongly suggest that the conductive heating caused by burial was\nthe main cause of organic maturation in the onshore Algarve Basin.\nThe Rr values measured also indicate that most of the Mesozoic\nrocks in the Algarve Basin are within the oil-window or the late oil-\nwindow (sensu Peters and Cassa, 1994).\n\nVR values from the same age strata are similar, regardless of\ngeographical location within the onshore Algarve Basin. Subsidence\nrates during the Upper TriassiceLower Cretaceous interval varied\nacross the Algarve Basin with the highest rates recorded in the\nEastern Sub-Basin (Faro area) and the lowest in the Sagres Sub-\nBasin (Terrinha, 1998; Terrinha et al., 2013) (Fig. 3). Therefore, for\nthis time interval, these two sub-basins of the Algarve Basin must\nhave experienced different geothermal gradients in order to pro-\nduce the maturation levels measured.\n\nPalaeogeothermal gradients have been modelled using the\nempirical equation of Barker (1988) that computes peak palae-\notemperature from VR value ([T(?C) \u00bc 104ln(Ro) \u00fe 148], where\nT(?C) is the maximum palaeotemperature attained by the rock and\nRo the VR value measured in the rock). The calculated palae-\notemperatures were used to estimate geothermal gradients and\nalso the amount of the eroded sedimentary sections of the areas\nstudied.\n\nThe calculated palaeotemperatures for all samples are shown in\nTables 1 and 2, and the modelled palaeogeothermal gradients for\nthe four areas of the onshore Algarve Basin are shown in Figure 10.\nPalaeotemperatures used for constructing the palaeogeothermal\ngradients were calculated using the mean VR values that were used\nto construct the VR profiles of each area (Figs. 5b, 6b, 7b and 8b).\nFigure 10. Calculated palaeogeothermal gradients of the four areas studied in the\nonshore Algarve Basin.\nCalculation of palaeogeothermal gradients is based on data from\nthe Upper Triassic through Lower Cretaceous interval, in order to\ncalculate geothermal gradients when sediments were at their\nmaximum burial depth and the amount of sediment removed.\nHence, a relatively high palaeogeothermal gradient of ca. 70 ?C/km\nwas calculated for the SagreseLagos area whereas the other three\nareas, all belonging to the Eastern Sub-Basin, have lower palae-\nogeothermal gradients of ca. 17 ?C/km in the Faro area, ca. 31 ?C/km\nin the Albufeira area, and ca. 37 ?C/km in the Tavira area. The\nrelatively low palaeogeothermal gradient in the Faro area could be\ndue possible to erroneous positioning of VR samples in the com-\nposite stratigraphic column, especially in the case of the Cretaceous\nvalue, the precise age of which is uncertain.\n\nThe palaeogeothermal gradients calculated for the Eastern Sub-\nBasin are within the range of geothermal gradients that characterize\nsedimentary basins developed in passive margin settings (Allen and\nAllen, 2005; McKenzie, 1978). The much higher palaeogeothermal\ngradient in the Western Sub-Basin is more difficult to interpret.\nLocally elevated VR values observed in the AptianeAlbian sedi-\nments at Praias da Luz and Porto de M\u00f3s in the SagreseLagos area\nare attributed to conductive heating related to a localized Late\nCretaceous igneous intrusion at Ponta das Ferrarias (see Section 6.1),\nalthough outcrops close to igneous intrusions were avoided during\nsampling in this area. With the exception of the two outcrops cited\nabove, this area is characterized by numerous intrusions that are\nrelated to the Monchique Syenite Massif dyke swarm (Rock, 1978,\n1982; Martins, 1999). The possibility that the elevated palae-\nogeothermal gradient in this area has been produced by concealed\nigneous intrusions cannot be discounted. Regional elevation in the\ngeothermal gradient related to the intrusion of the Upper Creta-\nceous Monchique Syenite igneous body (Gonz\u00e1lez-Clavijo and\nValadares, 2003) is less probable, since it only intrudes Late\nCarboniferous rocks and is located approximately 10 km from the\nAlgarve Basin (Fig. 1), though the geometry of its underground\nextension is unknown. On the basis of the maturation data pre-\nsented in this study for the SagreseLagos area, it is impossible to\ndetermine whether the magnitude of the Late Cretaceous igneous\nactivity related to the Monchique Massif was sufficient to elevate\nthe local geothermal gradient, or if the high gradient was due to\nother causes, such as close proximity to the North Atlantic rifting\naxis. This requires further investigation.\n\n7.2. Eroded cover estimates\n\nThe calculated palaeogeothermal gradients have also been used\nto estimate the amount of eroded sedimentary cover in the area\nstudied. The method employed is after Bray et al. (1992) and is\nsummarised in Figure 11. It utilises the value of the palaeogeothermal\ngradient (dT/dY)pal, the value of the palaeotemperature measured at\ntoday\u2019s surface (Ti at 0 m) and the likely surface palaeotemperature at\nthe time of maturation (Ts). The amount of the eroded cover is ob-\ntained, assuming that the palaeogeothermal gradient was constant\nthrough time, by dividing the difference (Ti ? Ts) for the value of the\npalaeogeothermal gradient (Fig. 11). One problem of this method is\nestimation of the palaeosurface temperature (Ts). Since the Algarve\nBasin was located in the tropical zone for most of Mesozoic time\n(Rocha, 1976; Terrinha et al., 2013) where mean temperatures are\nnormally ca. 20 ?C, this value has been used.\n\nApplying this methodology for the Mesozoic palaeothermal\ngradients calculated, the exhumation in the onshore Algarve Basin\nbefore the deposition of Miocene sediments is estimated at a\nmaximum of ca. 4000 m in the Faro area and a minimum of 880 m\nin the SagreseLagos area. In the Albufeira and Tavira areas, the\nremoved cover has similar thicknesses of 2225 m and 2430 m,\nrespectively. The most probable age for the removed cover is Upper\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Method for estimating the amount of eroded cover when the value of the\npalaeogeothermal gradient is constrained and a palaeosurface temperature Ts is\nassumed. (After Bray et al., 1992.)\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233228\nCretaceous (post-Cenomanian) to Palaeocene(?). The estimated\nthicknesses of cover removed suggest either continuous sedimen-\ntation in the Algarve Basin through much of Upper Cretaceous time\nor a substantial section eroded at the base of the Miocene\nunconformity.\n\n7.3. Timing of maturation\n\nThe timing of maturation in the Mesozoic rocks in the Algarve\nBasin is constrained by several lines of evidence. The first of these is\nthe break in the maturation trends between the mature Mesozoic\nsuccession and the immature Miocene. This discontinuity was\nfound in both the onshore (Tavira area) (Fig. 8b) and offshore\nsedimentary records (Fig. 3) implying that the timing of oil gener-\nation in the Algarve Basin is pre-Miocene. In the onshore Algarve\nBasin Miocene rocks unconformably overlie tilted and folded Upper\nTriassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and even Late Carboniferous basement\nrocks (Terrinha et al., 2013). No Palaeogene rocks are recognized\nonshore, and if they were ever deposited here, they were eroded\nprior to the deposition of the Miocene strata. In the offshore,\nPalaeogene sediments were recognized in two wells, Algarve-1 and\nAlgarve-2 (Fig.1). In well Algarve-1, Eocene to Oligocene limestones\nand dolomites unconformably overlie Lower Cretaceous clastic\nrocks, whereas in well Algarve-2, a Palaeocene to mid Eocene\n500 m thick succession of limestones and marls is unconformably\noverlain by Pliocene clays (Terrinha et al., 2013). This evidence in-\ndicates that there was no continuous sedimentation in the Algarve\nBasin through the CretaceousePalaeogene and Palaeogenee\nNeogene intervals. However, the lack of maturation data from the\nPalaeocene rocks precludes better constraint of the timing of\nmaturation and the possibility that peak temperatures, and oil\ngeneration were attained during Palaeocene times cannot be totally\ndiscarded. However, we do not favour this last hypothesis on the\nbasis of our maturation data and other regional geological evi-\ndence. Firstly, there is a lack of proven thick Palaeocene sequences\nin the Algarve Basin, both onshore and offshore of the order of\nmagnitude that was estimated (Section 7.2. Eroded cover esti-\nmates). Secondly, apatite fission track studies of the Carboniferous\nrocks located north of the Algarve Basin boundary and the Mon-\nchique Syenite Massif, indicate cooling ages of 113e111 Ma (Stapel,\n1999) and 72 Ma (Terrinha et al., 2006) respectively. In the case of\nthe Monchique Syenite Massif the apatite fission track age is\napproximately the same age of the emplacement (Miranda et al.,\n2009), indicating that the intrusion of the batholith occurred at\nshallow crustal depths and the Pennsylvanian greywackes and\nshales intruded were between 60 ?C and 90 ?C (Terrinha et al.,\n2013). This suggests that during latest CretaceouseEarly Palae-\nocene times basement rocks that surround the Algarve Basin, and\nprobably the Algarve Basin were subjected to active uplift and\nerosion and not enhanced subsidence. Therefore, we suggest that\npeak temperatures in the Mesozoic rocks of the Algarve Basin were\nattained in Late Cretaceous times but prior to 72 Ma (Campanian),\nepisode that coincide with the intrusion of the Monchique Syenite\nMassif.\n\nOther evidence for this interpretation includes the presence of\nreworked organic particles (vitrinite and palynomorphs) in the\nMiocene strata of the offshore wells. The reworked VR particles\nhave similar values to the Mesozoic successions, implying that\nsome the Mesozoic succession of the Algarve Basin was exposed\nand eroded during Miocene time. Possible extrabasinal sources for\nthe reworked organic particles are the Mesozoic rocks of the\nLusitanian Basin located in central littoral Portugal and the Meso-\nzoic rocks exposed in the Betic Cordillera in southern Spain.\n\nThe Albufeira and Loul\u00e9 diapirs also provide information on the\ntiming of maturation. In the case of the Albufeira Diapir, salt\nmovement was controlled by the eastewest trending Baleeira Fault\n(Terrinha, 1998). The evaporites (halite and anhydrite) crop out in\nthe hangingwall block of the fault and were injected across the fault\nzone, resulting in tectonic contact with Upper Jurassic and Lower\nCretaceous rocks. Halokinesis of the Albufeira Diapir was respon-\nsible for the tilting and rotation to the vertical of the Lower Creta-\nceous rocks in contact with the evaporites at Praia dos Arrifes\n(Fig. 12). VR measured in the Hettangian evaporites of the diapir is\n1.15%Rr but is ca. 0.65%Rr in the Lower Cretaceous, implying that the\nmain halokinesis movement post-dates organic maturation. A\nsimilar situation occurs in the Loul\u00e9 Diapir, where the VR for the\nUpper Jurassic rocks around Loul\u00e9 is 0.78%Rr, whereas the Hettan-\ngian evaporites have a value of ca.1.03%Rr, again suggesting that the\nmovement of the salt post-dates organic maturation. The main\nphase of salt movement occurred in relation to the principal episode\nof inversion of the Algarve Basin, which structural evidence, both\nonshore and offshore, indicates is Late CretaceousePalaeogene in\nage. It also suggests that the Algarve Basin was substantially uplifted\nduring Neogene times and a great deal of Mesozoic sediments was\nexhumed (Terrinha, 1998; Terrinha et al., 1990, 2013).\n\n7.4. 1D thermal modelling\n\nThe burial and thermal histories of the onshore Algarve Basin\nwere modelled using Schlumberger PetroMod 1D? software. The\nbasic data concerning the lithology, age and thickness of each rock\nunit were taken from the key measured sections in the four areas\nand from our own field observations. Input of the correct lithologies\ninto the model is very important since it controls parameters such\nas compaction rates and thermal conductivities. Palaeoheat flow\n(PHF) is another important parameter for modelling the tempera-\ntureetime curve. The palaeoheat flow over time used in modelling\nwas after the work of Matias (2007) for the offshore Algarve Basin.\nPalaeoheat flows were calculated for two episodes of rifting with\nlithospheric stretching factors of b \u00bc 1.5 for the Upper Triassic and\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Schematic geological cross section perpendicular to the Baleeira Fault, showing the position of the Albufeira Diapir and VR results. The location (A and B) of the cross-\nsection is shown in Figure 6a (adapted from Terrinha, 1998).\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 229\nb \u00bc 1.4 for the Cretaceous, values considered by Matias (2007) as\nappropriate for the evolution of this basin.\n\nThe other boundary conditions that were used in modelling\nwere the palaeo-water depth (PWD) and the temperature at the\nsedimentewater interface (SWIT). Depositional environment was\nthe only feature of the rocks that was taken into account to define\nthe PWD (in metres). SWIT was calculated from the palaeolatitude\nof the Algarve Basin during the Mesozoic. As the Algarve Basin was\nlocated within the tropical belt in Upper TriassiceLower Cretaceous\ntimes, a temperature of 20 ?C was adopted as the SWIT value for the\nshallow water carbonate rock units, whereas a temperature of 10 ?C\nwas used for marlelimestone sequences, representing deposition\nin deeper and colder shelf areas (ca. 50e100 m water depth).\n\nA critical point in the thermal history of the Algarve Basin\nrevealed by the analysis and interpretation of the VR data is that a\nconsiderable Late Cretaceous sedimentary succession was eroded\nprior to the deposition of the Miocene strata (see Section 7.2).\nMoreover, peak temperatures were probably also attained in latest\nCretaceous times (see Section 7.3). These two considerations were\ntaken into account in the 1D thermal modelling rather than unre-\nalistically high palaeoheat flows (and palaeogeothermal gradients)\nthat would be needed to fit the VR values if present day stratigraphic\nthicknesses were used. An additional sedimentary cover of Upper\nCretaceous age between 100 Ma (Cenomanian) and 72 Ma (Cam-\npanian), consisting of a carbonate sequence similar to the preserved\nLower Cretaceous with PWD of 10 m and SWITof 20 ?C was added to\nthe stratigraphic column of each area until the VR values and tem-\nperatures modelled fitted the VR values measured. The other limit\napplied to the model was that peak temperatures in the Mesozoic\nsuccession were attained in latest Cretaceous times (ca. 72 Ma).\nModelling of the two offshore wells was not attempted due to their\nlimited stratigraphy compared to the onshore Algarve Basin.\n\nFigure 13aed, shows the burial curves, together with the VR\nvalues and palaeotemperatures modelled with the 1D PetroMod\nmodel. For the burial curve of the SagreseLagos area (Fig. 13a), the\nvalue for the Late Cretaceous palaeoheat flow was increased in\nrelation to the other areas to conform with the VR data from this\narea. The values for the \u2018best-fit\u2019 Late Cretaceous cover thicknesses\nand palaeogeothermal gradients derived from the modelled burial\ncurves for each area are: SagreseLagos area 2500 m and 52 ?C/km;\nAlbufeira area 2200 m and 27.5 ?C/km; Faro area 2000 m and\n24.7 ?C/km and Tavira area 4000 m and 25.8 ?C/km.\n\nFor the areas situated in the Eastern Sub-Basin, the modelled\npalaeogeothermal gradients are very similar and, with the excep-\ntion of the Tavira area, a similar thickness of Upper Cretaceous\nsuccession was also estimated. This does not imply a higher rate of\nsubsidence for the Tavira area, rather that more exhumation took\nplace here because part of the Lower Cretaceous succession present\nin the Faro and Albufeira areas is missing. According to the\nmodelled burial curves, 2000e2200 m of Upper Cretaceous sedi-\nmentary rocks must have been deposited to account for the VR\nvalues measured in the Eastern Sub-Basin.\n\nIn the Western Sub-Basin, the modelled palaeogeothermal\ngradient is approximately double (52 ?C/km) that in the Eastern\nSub-Basin (24.7e27.5 ?C/km) but the thickness of the Upper\nCretaceous sedimentary pile is 2500 m, of similar magnitude to that\nin the Eastern Sub-Basin. This suggests that the process responsible\nfor the elevated regional palaeogeothermal gradient did not\nenhance the subsidence rate in this sub-basin.\n\nComparison of the modelled palaeogeothermal gradients with\nthose calculated directly from the VR profiles by the Barker (1988)\nequation for the Algarve Basin indicates that the latter are over-\nestimated by ca. 5e10 ?C/km. The exception to this is the Faro\narea, where the calculated VR palaeogeothermal gradient is\nlower. However, this may be due to an incorrect positioning of\nsamples in the composite stratigraphic column, as mentioned\npreviously (Section 6.3). Thus, the values of the modelled palae-\nogeothermal gradients are better constrained when compared\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Burial histories curves modelled for the areas studied in the onshore Algarve Basin, a) Sagres-Lagos, b) Albufeira, c) Faro and d) Tavira.\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233230\nwith the calculated by the VR profiles using the Barker (1988)\nequation, implying that the modelled thicknesses for eroded\nUpper Cretaceous sedimentary pile are also more realistic. This is\nalso due to the fact that the model computes the evolution of the\npalaeoheat flow and the petrophysical parameters (compaction,\nrock thermal conductivities, etc.) over time, factors that are not\ntaking into account in computations using only the VR profiles.\n\n8. Implications for hydrocarbon exploration\n\nVR, qualitative spore fluorescence and TAI determinations\nindicate that the Mesozoic succession in the onshore Algarve Basin\nlies within the oil-window. The Hettangian evaporites have Rr ca.\n1.1% and the Lower Cretaceous sediments ca. 0.52e0.7%. The\nMesozoic succession in the offshore wells, Hettangian and Cal-\nlovian strata in the well Ruivo, and Oxfordian rocks in the well\nCorvina, all lie within the late oil-window. Modelled burial curves\nindicate that palaeogeothermal gradients for the onshore succes-\nsions vary between 24.7 and 27.5 ?C/km in the Eastern Sub-Basin,\nbut a higher gradient of 52 ?C/km has been calculated for the\nWestern Sub-Basin. The cause of local elevation in the regional\npalaeogeothermal gradients remains uncertain. These results,\ntogether with regional geological evidence indicate that peak\npalaeotemperatures were probably attained in late Cretaceous\n\n\n\nFigure 13. (continued).\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 231\ntime. However, the potential source rock intervals probably\nstopped generating from the moment the uplift of the onshore area\nbegan, ca. 72 Ma. Modelled burial curves suggest that the Lower\nJurassic succession across the Algarve Basin entered the oil window\nat the beginning of the Cretaceous and that peak oil generation\noccurred in late Cretaceous time. Therefore, some of the Jurassic\nand Lower Cretaceous sections in the Algarve Basin have consid-\nerable potential as targets for future oil exploration.\n\n\n\nP. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233232\nBetween 2000 and 2500 m of cover must have been deposited\nand subsequently eroded in the onshore area in order to account for\nthe maturation levels measured. This implies continuous subsi-\ndence and sedimentation during Late Cretaceous time up to 72 Ma.\nTectonic inversion of the Algarve Basin probably occurred during\nthe Palaeogene and was related to the onset of the alpine tectonism\nand the emplacement of the Monchique Syenite (Terrinha et al.,\n2002; Miranda et al., 2009). The low maturity of the Miocene\nsediments (immature with respect to the oil-window) both\nonshore and offshore proves that MioceneePleistocene reburial of\nthe Mesozoic succession did not increase its maturity.\n\nEven though the Mesozoic succession lies within the oil-\nwindow, oil shows are virtually absent in the Algarve Basin. The\npresence of small amounts of oil filling fractures and pores in a\nsample of jet recently found in the KimmeridgianeTithonian\nEscarp\u00e3o Limestones in the Eastern Sub-Basin (Fig. 2) confirms to\nsome extent the maturation levels established by our study (Costa\net al., 2010). The absence of oil shows may be due to the type of\norganic matter observed in the organic residues of the rocks of the\nAlgarve Basin. The most abundant organic particles found in the\norganic residues of the Algarve Basin are terrestrially derived (vit-\nrinite and inertinite). This type of organic matter (kerogen type IIIe\nII) is gas prone type rather than oil prone. However, another likely\nexplanation was that oil generated and trapped during burial\nescaped from the reservoirs during the uplift events in the latest\nCretaceous and early Tertiary. Investigation of source rock quality\nand quantity is beyond the scope of this work but a comprehensive\nstudy is clearly needed in order to ascertain the stratigraphic dis-\ntribution of the organic facies and source rock potential.\n\n9. Summary and conclusions\n\nVR results from 175 samples demonstrate that the Mesozoic\nsuccession in the Algarve Basin lies within the oil window. VR\nranges from 0.52e0.70%Rr in the Lower Cretaceous to 1e1.1%Rr in\nthe Upper TriassiceHettangian section. Miocene carbonates and\nmudrocks that unconformably overlie the Mesozoic strata are\nimmature with regard to the oil window. The Mesozoic successions\nin the Ruivo and Corvina wells in the offshore part of the Algarve\nBasin lie within the late oil-window. As in the onshore Algarve\nBasin, Miocene rocks in these offshore wells are immature.\n\nPalynological study of the offshore Ruivo and Corvina wells has\nprovided new stratigraphic information. In the Ruivo well, most of\nthe palynological productive Mesozoic section consists of thick\nmarls and limestones that yielded a dinoflagellate assemblage of\nCallovian age. These rocks overlie evaporites of Hettangian age. The\nMesozoic section in the Corvina well yielded a dinoflagellate\nassemblage of mid to upper Oxfordian age.\n\nModelled palaeogeothermal gradients in the Eastern Sub-Basin\nrange from 24.7 to 27.5 ?C/km, whereas a higher gradient of\n52 ?C/km was modelled for the Western Sub-Basin. Peak temper-\natures in the Algarve Basin were attained during Late Cretaceouse\nEarly Palaeocene(?) time. To account for the maturation levels\ndetermined in the onshore Algarve Basin, 2000e2500 m of cover\nmust have been eroded. This erosion occurred during much of\nPalaeogene time and was due to the onset of the Alpine Orogeny.\nEvidence for this event is provided by the considerable amount of\nreworked vitrinite particles and palynomorphs found together with\nthe indigenous organic particles in the Miocene succession of the\noffshore wells Ruivo and Corvina. The maturation levels of the\nreworked organic material are similar to the levels of the Mesozoic\nrocks of the Algarve Basin suggest, therefore, that parts of the basin\nwere already exposed and were being eroded during Miocene\ntimes. Modelled burial curves suggest that the Upper Triassice\nHettangian section entered the oil window in Early Cretaceous time\nand that peak temperatures of all the stratigraphic units were\nattained in latest Cretaceous time.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work is a contribution to the project PTDC/CTE-GEX/72694/\n2006 financed by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and\nTechnology (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia e FCT).

The aim of this work is to constrain\nthe provenance and tectonic setting of these sediments in a context of a complex evolution of SW Iberian\nVariscides. For this purpose, we performed a systematic study of petrographical and geochemical signatures\nof greywackes and shales from the three BAFG formations: M\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira. Major and trace\nelement composition and ratios suggest heterogeneous source area composition for BAFG shales and\ngreywackes. For the oldest M\u00e9rtola Formation greywackes, source area is dominated by granitoid rocks\nwith minor mafic input. The latter becomes residual in the Mira Formation. The youngest Brejeira Formation\ngreywackes show clear felsic affiliation associated with an increase in recycled components. The shales of all\nthree BAFG formations denote a granodioritic affiliation. Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Plagioclase\nIndex of Alteration (PIA) values suggest moderate weathering in the source areas of M\u00e9rtola and Mira forma-\ntions. These indices, together with A\u2013CN\u2013K relations, point out to steady-state weathering conditions in the\nsource areas of both formations. In contrast, both CIA and PIA values for the Brejeira Formation indicate var-\niable conditions of palaeoweathering, from moderate to intense, as a consequence of non-steady-state condi-\ntions probably triggered by tectonic instability in the provenance area. Compared to the greywackes, the\nshales of all three BAFG formations exhibit higher CIA and PIA values, as well as low K2O/Al2O3 (~0.2) and\nindex of compositional variability (b1), reflecting the cumulative effect of multiple cycles of sedimentary\nrecycling and prolonged chemical weathering history. Major and trace element distribution and upper con-\ntinental crust-normalized multi-element plots suggest that the sediments of BAFG were derived mainly\nfrom a continental arc/active margin with minor contribution from old continental crust. Together, our geo-\nchemical data are compatible with BAFG sediments derived mainly from SW border of the Ossa Morena Zone\n(Gondwanan affinity), with possible contribution from an external (Avalonian) source.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Diverse techniques\nbased on petrographic and geochemical criteria have been successfully\nused for this purpose (e.g., Dickinson and Suczek, 1979; Ingersoll et al.,\n1984; Taylor and McLennan, 1985; Wronkiewicz and Condie, 1987;\nMcLennan, 1989; McLennan et al., 1990, 1993; Zuffa, 1991; McLennan\nand Hemming, 1992). Geochemistry of major and trace elements of\nsiliciclastic rocks provides valuable information regarding the com-\nposition of the sediment source areas, palaeoweathering conditions,\n\nhydraulic selection, recycling and, in some cases, the tectonic setting\nof the sedimentary basins (e.g., Nesbitt and Young, 1982; Bhatia and\nCrook, 1986; Fedo et al., 1995; Bauluz et al., 2000; Cullers and\nPodkovyrov, 2002; McLennan et al., 2003; Armstrong-Altrin et al., 2004;\nSlack et al., 2004; Veizer and Mackenzie, 2005; Etemad-Saeed et al.,\n2011). A main premise relies on the assumption that certain trace ele-\nments (e.g., Th, Sc, Rare Earth Elements (REE)) tend to stay in a particulate\nphase during weathering, erosion and transport, and thus are transferred\nto a sedimentary record proportionally to their abundances in the source\narea (McLennan et al., 1990).\n\nGeodynamic and palaeogeographic reconstructions place the South\nPortuguese Zone (SPZ, Fig. 1) as an external zone of the Iberian\nVariscides and thus a possible western equivalent of the northern\nVariscan belt (i.e. southwest England and Ireland, and Rhenohercynian\nZone of northwest Germany; Ribeiro et al., 1990, 2007; Oliveira and\nQuesada, 1998; Franke, 2000; von Raumer et al., 2003; Nance et al.,\n\nSedimentary Geology 284\u2013285 (2013) 133\u2013148\n\n?

Within the SPZ, several domains can be recognized, among them\na thick siliciclastic succession of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group\n(BAFG). The BAFG is made up, from base to top, by three formations,\nM\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira, deposited between Middle Vis\u00e9an to\nMoscovian times (Oliveira, 1983, 1990; Pereira, 1999; Pereira et al.,\n2007, 2008). The deposition of the BAFG has been interpreted as a con-\nsequence of the oblique collision between the SPZ, of Avalonian affinity,\nand the Ossa Morena Zone, of Gondwanan affinity (Oliveira, 1990; Silva\net al., 1990; von Raumer et al., 2003; Ribeiro et al., 2007; Jorge et al.,\n2012).\n\nPrevious provenance studies of BAFG have been limited mostly to the\npaleocurrents and petrographic analyses of the Vis\u00e9an M\u00e9rtola Forma-\ntion (van den Boogaard, 1967; Schermerhorn, 1971; Oliveira, 1983,\n1988; Moreno, 1988, 1993; Moreno and S\u00e1ez, 1989). The source area\nfor the M\u00e9rtola Formation sediments has been considered to derive\nfrom terranes located to the north of the basin (so called Beja Geanticline,\nSW border of the Ossa Morena Zone), actively uplifted during Lower and\nMiddle Carboniferous (Schermerhorn, 1971). An opposing view of van\nden Boogaard (1967) and Oliveira (1983, 1988), proposes the Iberian\nPyrite Belt (IPB), together with limited input from external sources, as\na main source for M\u00e9rtola Formation sediments. Moreno (1988, 1993),\nand Moreno and S\u00e1ez (1989) favor the contribution of two coeval turbi-\ndite systems fed from two different sources, the OMZ and the IPB.\n\nIn this work we present the first systematic study of the detrital\nmodes and major, trace and rare earth element distribution in\ngreywackes and shales of all three formations of the BAFG. The aim of\nthis study is to assess the potential variations in the palaeoweathering\nconditions, source area composition and sedimentary recycling, to fur-\nther constrain the tectonic setting of basin in the context of evolution\nof SW Iberian Variscides.\n\n2. Geological and stratigraphic setting\n\nThe northern contact between the SPZ and the Precambrian\u2013\nPalaeozoic rocks of the OMZ is marked by the presence of the Beja\u2013\nAcebuches Ophiolite Complex, an important variscan suture. To the\nsouth the SPZ is unconformably overlain by the Mesozoic rocks of the Al-\ngarve Basin (Fig. 1). The SPZ comprises rocks ranging from Middle Devo-\nnian (or older?) to Pennsylvanian in age, which are organized into four\ngeological domains, from north to south: the Pulo do Lobo Antiform\n(PLA), the IPB, the BAFG and the Southwest Portugal Domain (SPD)\n(Oliveira, 1990; Oliveira et al., 2006). The core of the PLA comprises high-\nly deformed phyllites, quartzites, minor felsic volcanics and metabasalts\nwith MORB-type geochemical affinities (Munh\u00e1, 1983; Quesada et al.,\n1994). In the northern and southern limbs of this antiform occur\nsiliclastic successions dated by palynomorphs from Lower Frasnian to\nUpper Famennian (Pereira et al., 2006a). The geological setting of the\nPLA within the SPZ is still controversial and is interpreted by some\nauthors as an accretionary prism related to a northward dipping subduc-\ntion of late Palaeozoic Rheic ocean under the OMZ (Munh\u00e1 et al., 1986;\nSilva et al., 1990; Fonseca and Ribeiro, 1993; Quesada et al., 1994;\nNance et al., 2010) and by others as a complex antiform structure\nresulting from the superimposition of an accretionary prism by a discor-\ndant sedimentary basin contemporaneous to the IPB detritic substrate\n(Oliveira et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2006a).\n\nThe IPB is formed by the Phyllite\u2013Quartzite Group (PQ) at the base\nand the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex (VSC) at the top of the succes-\nsion. The PQ comprises of a detrital sequence of shales and sandstones\nwith occasional bioclastic limestones in the upper levels (Oliveira,\n1990). The PQ was laid down in a shallow water environment, possibly\na large marine siliciclastic platform affected by wave and storm events\n(Moreno and S\u00e1ez, 1990; Oliveira, 1990; Moreno et al., 1996; Jorge\net al., 2007). The compositional maturity of the PQ sediments and\ntheir geochemical and isotope signatures are consistent with a passive\ncontinental margin depositional setting (Jorge et al., 2006, 2012).\nThe PQ's thickness is in excess of 1000 m and its base is not known.\n\nThe upper levels are dated as Middle to Upper Devonian (Givetian to\nFamennian) based on various palaeontological indicators (Lake et al.,\n1988; Oliveira, 1990; Gonz\u00e1lez, 2005; Pereira et al., 2008).\n\nThe VSC represents a submarine volcanic succession interbedded\nwith abundant siliciclastic rocks and minor Si\u2013Fe\u2013Mn exhalites\n(Barriga, 1990; Oliveira, 1990). The magmatism in the IPB was gener-\nated within an intracontinental environment affected by transtensil\ntectonics and is represented by a bimodal, predominantly felsic suite\n(Munh\u00e1, 1983; Silva et al., 1990; Mitjavila et al., 1997). The architec-\nture of the felsic volcanic centers is defined by lava\u2013cryptodome\u2013\npumice cone volcanoes (Rosa et al., 2010). The volcanic rocks are sub-\nordinate, comprising only about 25% of the succession of the VSC\n(Tornos, 2006). The siliciclastic rocks are represented by black shales,\npurple shales and siltstones. The VSC hosts the world's largest\nprovince of volcanic-hosted massive sulfides, of more than 88 deposits\nincluding several giants and world class units (e.g., Barriga, 1990; Saez\net al., 1999; Tornos, 2006). The thickness of the VSC varies from\nfew tens of meters to more than 1000 m. Sediments interbedded\nwith the volcanics yielded palynomorphs (and rare conodonts) that\ndate the VSC from Upper Devonian to Upper Vis\u00e9an (Oliveira, 1990;\nOliveira et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 2008).\n\nThe deposition of the BAFG turbiditic sediments resulted from the\ninversion in the tectonic regime of the SPZ that started in the Middle\nVis\u00e9an, as a consequence of the oblique collision between the SPZ and\nthe OMZ which created a major compressive regime. During this\nphase the tectonic stacking created by south verging folds and thrust\nfaults allowed a development of a basin, probably a foreland, where\nthe BAFG accumulated (Oliveira, 1990; Ribeiro et al., 1990, 2007;\nSilva et al., 1990).\n\nThe Middle to Upper Vis\u00e9an M\u00e9rtola Formation of the BAFG consists\nof greywackes interbedded with shales, siltstones, rare conglomerates\nand mudflow deposits. The majority of the greywackes exhibit sedi-\nmentary features typical of proximal turbiditic deposits, organized in\nseveral thinning-upward sequences resulting from lateral lobe migra-\ntion and avulsion. Palaeocurrent studies in the M\u00e9rtola region indicate\nprogradation of the turbidite lobes to S\u2013SW (Oliveira, 1983, 1988).\nThick shaley intervals within the M\u00e9rtola Formation turbiditic lobes\ncontain Upper Vis\u00e9an ammonoids fauna and miospores. The M\u00e9rtola\nFormation is in excess of 1000 m thick (Oliveira, 1983, 1988). At the\nboundary between the M\u00e9rtola and the younger Mira Formation occurs\na laterally continuous 50\u2013100 m thick belt of black shales and siltstones.\nUppermost Vis\u00e9an ammonoids from these sediments may indicate a\nperiod of major transgression ca. 330\u2013328 My.\n\nThe Mira Formation comprises greywackes interbedded with shales\nand rare conglomerate beds. The turbidites of the Mira Formation are\ngenerally thinner bedded and have fewer sand-rich horizons than\nthose from the M\u00e9rtola Formation. The few available palaeocurrent\ndata indicate southwest progradation of sedimentary lobes. Ammonoid\nfaunas from the Mira Formation shale beds point out a Serpukhovian to\nMiddle Bashkirian age (Oliveira, 1990).\n\nThe Brejeira Formation is made up by greywackes, shales and\nquartzwackes, and, similarly to the other two formations, exhibits an\noverall turbiditic character. The basal part of this formation comprises a\n5 to 10 km wide belt, exhibiting thick beds of matrix poor quartzwackes\ninterbedded with shales (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira, 1990). Another\nbelt comprising thick-bedded matrix rich greywackes and shales oc-\ncupies a vast area to the southwest. Coarse-grained greywackes of this\nlast belt overlie the lithologies of the SPD, in some places on an erosional\ncontact. Palaeocurrents measured in the northern quartz-rich turbiditic\nbelt exhibit complex flow patterns with directions to SE and E and, at a\nlesser extent, to the SW (Oliveira, 1983). In the coastal sections of the\nBrejeira Formation flow directions of palaeocurrents are to the N. De-\ntailed studies of the palynomorphs and ammonoid fauna of the Brejeira\nFormation indicate ages ranging from the Upper Bashkirian (miospore\nbiozone FR), near the contact with the Mira Formation, to Lower\nMoscovian (miospore biozone OT), in the coastal sections to the north\n\n135R.C.G.S. Jorge et al. / Sedimentary Geology 284\u2013285 (2013) 133\u2013148\n\n\n\nof Cape Saint Vincent (Pereira, 1999; Pereira et al., 2008). In Upper\nBashkirian\u2013Moscovian times the progradation of the turbiditic deposi-\ntion reached the SPD.\n\n3. Sampling and analytical techniques\n\nA total of 78 representative samples of shales and greywackes from\nM\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira Formations were collected from outcrops\n(60) and from mineral exploration boreholes (18) in the Portuguese\nand Spanish sectors of the SPZ (Fig. 1a and b, respectively). Borehole\nsamples were collected from three mineral exploration boreholes\n(AC1, CD1 and CD2) in the Portuguese sector of the SPZ. Figs. 1 and 2\nshow the geographic distribution of the samples and their stratigraphic\nposition within the BAFG units. The borehole samples all belong to the\nlower levels of the M\u00e9rtola Formation in close relation to the VSC. Bore-\nhole AC1 (Alcaria da Cova) has a total depth of ca. 1000 m. The first\n590 m of this borehole cut lithologies from the M\u00e9rtola Formation\nbelow which occurs stratigraphic contact with the VSC rocks. Boreholes\nCD1 (Cidr\u00e3o 1) and CD2 (Cidr\u00e3o 2) show a ca. 200 m thick VSC succes-\nsion thrusted over the M\u00e9rtola Formation Greywackes and shales of the\nM\u00e9rtola Formation occur stratigraphically above the VSC succession, in\nthe hanging wall of the thrusted block. Thus, the samples collected from\n\nborehole CD1 are from the M\u00e9rtola Formation in the footwall of the\nthrust block whereas the samples from the borehole CD2 are from the\nhanging wall block (Fig. 1).\n\nThe studied samples were classified into greywacke and shale\nbased on regional geological comparison (e.g. Oliveira et al., 1979;\nOliveira, 1983, 1990) and petrographic study. A group of 41 thin sec-\ntions of BAFG greywackes were studied in detail, of those 20 from\nM\u00e9rtola, 13 from Mira and 8 from Brejeira Formations. Point counting\nof an average of 320 framework grains per sample was performed\naccording to the method of Gazzi\u2013Dickinson (Ingersoll et al., 1984).\nThe cement and matrix (pseudomatrix) were not counted.\n\nA group of 74 samples from boreholes (14) and outcrops (60)\nwere selected for the whole-rock geochemistry analysis. This group\nincludes 41 greywackes (5 borehole samples, 36 from outcrops) and\n33 shales (9 borehole samples, 24 from outcrops). All samples were\ncleaned and all weathering coats removed. Samples were ground in\nan agate mill at the Geology Department of Faculty of Sciences of\nLisbon University.\n\nThe analytical procedures used were inductively coupled plasma-\noptical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for major elements analysis\nplus Ba, Sr and Zr; and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrome-\ntry (ICP-MS) for the majority of trace elements. All analyses were\n\nFig. 2. Stratigraphic position of the BAFG greywackes and shales.\n\n136 R.C.G.S.

Alkaline dissolution\nwith lithium metaborate/tetraborate followed by nitric acid dissolu-\ntion was performed for all analyses, except for the determination of\nCu, Ni and Zn, for which acid digestion was carried out. The standards\nused were: NIST 694, DNC-1, BIR-1, FK-N, NIST 1633b, SY-3, W-2, NIST\n696, JSD-3, CTA-AC-1, WMG-1, GXR-1, MICA-FE, GXR-2, LKSD-3 and\nMAG-1. Appendix 1 shows the analyses for three standard reference\nmaterials (BIR-1, W-2a and DNC-1) and detection limits for each ele-\nment. The calculated reproducibility is better than 3% for major-\nelement contents (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3; Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O\nand P2O5), b4% for rare earth elements (REE) and ?5% for high field\nstrength elements (HFSE). Additional information on analytical proce-\ndures is available at http://www.actlabs.com. For the weight/weight\nconversion from major oxides to atoms conversion factors were used,\naccording to Ragland (1989).\n\n4. Petrography\n\nThe greywackes of the M\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira Formations exhibit\ndifferences in the relative abundances of their major components,\nquartz, feldspar and lithoclasts (Appendix 2). The average modal\ncompositions of greywackes from the M\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira Forma-\ntions are Qt46.2F26.9L26.9, Qt61.7F7.6L30.7, and Qt83.1F6.7L10.1, respectively,\nwhere Qt is the total quartz, F the sum of plagioclases and K-feldspar\nand L is the sum of all lithic fragments (volcanic, sedimentary and\nmetasedimentary). Matrix constitutes 20\u201330% of all greywackes stud-\nied. The major clastic component of the M\u00e9rtola Formation is quartz,\nwhich shows rounded to sub-rounded forms. Quartz grains often\nshow diffuse boundaries and irregular contacts due to some degree of\ndissolution into the matrix. In all samples, the contents in feldspar and\nlithic components, mainly represented by volcanic rocks, vary signifi-\ncantly (Fig. 3a, b). The abundance of opaque minerals, mainly diagenetic\n\nFig. 3. Photomicrographs of detrital components in the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group greywackes under cross-polarized light. (a\u2013b) Samples from the M\u00e9rtola Formation show large rock\nfragments and several types of subangular quartz with low esfericity. (b\u2013c) Mira Formation samples exhibit fewer lithoclast fragments. (e\u2013f) Brejeira Formation samples show very well\ncalibrated clasts mainly composed of quartz.

In Mira greywackes, quartz is the major component,\noccurring with rounded to angular forms. Lithoclasts of volcanic grains\nare the second most abundant modal grains, with few exceptions\n(Fig. 3c, d). Feldspars, as average, represent less than 10% of the clastic\ngrains. The occurrence of opaque minerals is relatively high. Accessory\nheavy minerals are represented by zircon, rutile and tourmaline. Brejeira\ngreywackes are mainly composed of quartz and exhibit well-sorted\ngrains. Abundant quartz grains assume rounded to sub-rounded forms,\noften with sutured contacts and showing the effects of pressure solution.\nLithoclasts are mostly composed by sedimentary and metasedimentary\ngrains. Volcanic grains are rare (Fig. 3e, f). Opaque minerals are relatively\nabundant. Tourmaline, zircon and rutile are more abundant in the\nBrejeira than both the M\u00e9rtola and Mira greywackes.\n\nIn the QtFL provenance ternary diagram (Dickinson et al., 1983) the\ngreywackes from the BAFG do not fall into the same field (Fig. 4a). The\nM\u00e9rtola greywackes plot in the field of dissected magmatic arc and\nrecycled orogenic sources whereas the Brejeira greywackes plot almost\nexclusively in the field of recycled orogenic sources. Mira samples plot\nmainly in the recycled orogenic field, showing a distribution stretching\nfrom Brejeira to M\u00e9rtola samples. On the QmFLt triangular diagram\n(monocrystalline quartz, feldspar and total lithic fragments) the\nM\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira greywackes all exhibit a similar distribution\npatterns (Fig. 4b; after Dickinson et al., 1983). These data suggest the\ninitial derivation of the BAFG sediments from the dissected magmatic\narc, with gradual increase in recycled components, most pronounced\nin the youngest Brejeira Formation.\n\n5. Whole-rock geochemistry\n\nMean chemical composition, variation range and standard devia-\ntion for shales and greywackes from the three BAFG formations are\nlisted in Table 1, and Appendix 3 contains geochemistry analyses for\nall samples. The geochemistry data for borehole and outcrop samples\nare presented together, since no statistically significant compositional\ndifferences between these two groups were found. Fig. 5 shows plots\nof average major and trace elements from the BAFG greywackes and\nshales normalized to UCC values (Taylor and McLennan, 1985).\n\n5.1. Major elements\n\nThe geochemistry of major elements clearly reflects the mineralogy\nof the greywackes from the three BAFG formations (Table 1). Average\n\nSiO2 and Al2O3 in M\u00e9rtola greywackes are 64.8\u00b13.4% and 15.8\u00b11.8%,\nrespectively. Similar values are recorded for the Mira Formation\n(SiO2=68.8\u00b15.8% and Al2O3=13.2\u00b11.7%). The Brejeira greywackes\nshow higher SiO2 (78.1\u00b15.7%) and lower Al2O3 (9.0\u00b11.2%) contents\nreflecting a greater amount of detrital quartz in these rocks. Shales\nfrom M\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira have average SiO2 content of 58.1\u00b1\n1.6%, 55.3\u00b13.3% and 54.1\u00b12.8%, respectively. The Al2O3 contents for\nthese rocks are similar (M\u00e9rtola=19.0\u00b10.9%, Mira=22.2\u00b12.0%,\nBrejeira=24.0\u00b11.9%).\n\nThe index of compositional variability (ICV) [(Fe2O3+K2O+Na2O+\nCaO+MgO+MnO+TiO2)/Al2O3] can be used as a measure of compo-\nsitional maturity of mudstones (Cox et al., 1995). Immature mudstones\nrich in non-clay silicate minerals show ICV values greater than one.\nIn contrast, more mature mudstones exhibit values below one,\nreflecting mineralogy with the predominance of clay minerals (Cullers\nand Podkovyrov, 2002). The average values of ICV for the M\u00e9rtola,\nMira and Brejeira shales are 0.9\u00b10.05 (1.0\u20130.8), 0.7\u00b10.1 (0.8\u20130.5)\nand 0.6\u00b10.03 (0.7\u20130.6), respectively. The mean K2O/Al2O3 ratio for all\ngroups of analyzed shales is ~0.2. Together, the ICV values and the\nK2O/Al2O3 ratios suggest compositional maturity of the BAFG shales\n(Table 2).\n\nGreywackes of M\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira Formation have average\nK2O/Na2O ratios of 0.7\u00b10.7 (3\u20130.3), 0.9\u00b10.5 (2.5\u20130.5) and 2.6\u00b12.2\n(6.4\u20131.0), respectively Table 2. In the ternary plot (Fe2O3+MgO)?\nNa2O?K2O of Blatt et al. (1980) M\u00e9rtola and Mira greywackes plot\nalong the fields of sodic and ferromagnesian potassic (Fig. 6). All but\none Brejeira greywackes are limited to the field of ferromagnesian\npotassic.\n\nCompared with the UCC values, all analyzed greywackes, with\nthe exception of Brejeira ones, exhibit similar MgO contents and\nhave slightly higher TiO2, Fe2O3 and MnO. Variable depletion in\nCaO, Na2O and K2O is observed (Fig. 5a). Shales show a similar\npattern, with a generalized slight enrichment in K2O and variable\ndepletion in MgO (except for the M\u00e9rtola Formation), CaO and\nNa2O (Fig. 5b).\n\nSiO2 exhibits variable negative correlation with Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3,\nK2O, MnO, MgO and P2O5 for all analyzed greywackes, reflecting the\nquartz dilution effect (Fig. 7a\u2013d). Al2O3 correlates well with K2O,\nFe2O3 and TiO2 (Fig. 7e). In the shales, SiO2 also shows negative corre-\nlation with a majority of major elements, and Al2O3 shows positive\ncorrelation with K2O, MgO, Fe2O3 and TiO2 (Fig. 7a\u2013e). This suggests\nthat chemical weathering in the source area was a dominant factor\ncontrolling the mineralogy of weathered products. In fact, during\n\nFig. 4.

Trace elements\n\nAs expected, average trace elements concentrations of the BAFG\ngreywackes are lower than those in the shales, due to the quartz dilu-\ntion effect. With the exception of the Brejeira, all other greywackes ex-\nhibit variable enrichment in transition trace elements (TTE) Sc, V, Cr, Ni\nand Co relative to the UCC (Fig. 5c). In M\u00e9rtola and Mira greywackes, the\ndegree of enrichment undergoes great sample-to-sample variability,\nalthough this is more pronounced in the M\u00e9rtola Formation. Large Ion\nLithophile Elements (LILE) concentration in greywackes is generally\nlower than in the UCC. The BAFG shales exhibit enrichment in TTE sim-\nilar to those observed in greywackes (Fig. 5d). The enrichment in Rb, Ba\nand Cs, together with the depletion in Sr, is consistent with the geo-\nchemical behavior of K and Ca.\n\nSc, V and Cr in shales and greywackes show moderate to strong pos-\nitive correlation with Al2O3 and K2O (Fig. 7f\u2013h), suggesting that abun-\ndances of these elements are controlled by K-bearing phyllosilicates.\nWith the exception of M\u00e9rtola Formation, all analyzed greywackes\nexhibit variable enrichment in Zr compared to the UCC (190 ppm;\nTaylor and McLennan, 1985), best pronounced in Brejeira greywackes,\nwhere average Zr content is 286\u00b148 ppm (389\u2013233 ppm), probably\nreflecting an increased influence of hydraulic selection and/or sedimen-\ntary recycling. All greywackes and shales exhibit high positive correla-\ntion between Zr\u2013Hf and Nb\u2013Ta indicating that both pairs of elements\nare fixed in zircon and rutile. Additionally, Th and Al2O3 show positive\n\ncorrelation in all analyzed rocks, once again pointing out the impor-\ntance of phyllosilicates in controlling their abundances.\n\n5.3. Rare earth elements\n\nThe average of total of REE (?REE) contents for M\u00e9rtola, Mira and\nBrejeira greywackes (139, 131 and 137 ppm respectively) are slightly\nless than the UCC (146.4 ppm; Taylor and McLennan, 1985). Shales\nfrom the three formations have variable enrichment in ?REE\n(M\u00e9rtola=177, Mira=230 and Brejeira=253 ppm) relatively to\nthe UCC.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 8, average chondrite-normalized REE patterns\n(Taylor and McLennan, 1985) of analyzed rocks are enriched in light\nREE (LREE) (Lan/Smnb5), with the flattened patterns of heavy REE\n(HREE) (Gbn/Ybn: 1.5\u20132). The Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu*) is variable. For\nM\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira greywackes the values of Eu/Eu* are\n0.84\u00b10.10, 0.75\u00b10.08, and 0.68\u00b10.01, respectively. In shales these\nvalues are 0.66\u00b10.07 for M\u00e9rtola, 0.73\u00b10.05 for Mira, and 0.72\u00b1\n0.02 for Brejeira Formation.\n\n?LREE and ?HREE of analyzed shales show weak positive corre-\nlation with Al2O3. Additionally, ?HREE of Mira and Brejeira shales\nshow strong positive correlation with Y (r=0.99 and r=0.73, re-\nspectively) reflecting the role of Y-rich minerals in the control of\nREE contents of these rocks. ?LREE and ?HREE of M\u00e9rtola\ngreywackes exhibit significative positive correlation with Al2O3 (r=\n0.74 and r=0.89), TiO2 (r=0.63 and r=0.80) and Y (r=0.90 and\nr=0.99). ?HREE in these rocks do not correlate with P2O5. ?LREE\nand ?HREE of Mira greywackes show positive correlation with\nAl2O3 (r=0.55 for both) and P2O5 (r=0.55 and r=0.66).

Jorge et al. / Sedimentary Geology 284\u2013285 (2013) 133\u2013148\n\n\n\nBrejeira greywackes, ?LREE show weak correlation with TiO2 (r=\n0.45) while ?HREE correlate weakly with Al2O3 (r=0.44) and\nP2O5 (r=0.67). Only in these greywackes that strong correlation of\n?HREE with TiO2 (r=0.91), Zr (r=0.75) and Y (r=0.98) is ob-\nserved. Collectively, these correlations suggest the variable influence\nof several mineralogical phases, such as phyllosilicates, phosphates\nand zircon, on the control of REE contents of BFGA lithologies.\n\n6. Palaeoweathering conditions\n\nWeathering intensity at the source area is one of the main factors\nwhich influence both the mineralogy and the alkaline and alkaline\nearth element concentration of siliciclastic rocks. Large ionic radius\ncations such as Cs, Rb and Ba are preferentially fixed in weathering\nprofiles through adsorption on clays, while smaller cations like Na,\nCa and Sr are selectively leached from them (Nesbitt et al., 1980).\nThe Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) proposed by Nesbitt and\nYoung (1982) is particularly useful because it reflects the intensity\nof chemical weathering in the source area while also allowing a quan-\ntitative measure of the amount of chemically weathered materials in-\ncluded in siliciclastic rocks (Nesbitt, 2003). CIA varies from ?50 for\nunweathered igneous rocks to near 100 for residual clays enriched\nin kaolinite and Al oxi-hydroxides. This index is calculated using\nmolar proportions of the following oxides: CIA=[Al2O3/(Al2O3+\nCaO*+Na2O+K2O)]\u00d7100, where CaO* is the amount of CaO in-\ncorporated in the silicate fraction of the sample only, after correc-\ntion for Ca contained in carbonate (McLennon, 1993; Fedo et al.,\n1995).\n\nThe CO2 contents were not analyzed in this study. Majority of\nstudied samples show very low average CaO content (b2%, Table 1\nand Appendix 3). In few samples, where petrographic examination\nrevealed a presence of carbonates, the CIA value was corrected\naccording to McLennon (1993).\n\nM\u00e9rtola and Mira greywackes exhibit average CIA values of 66.3\u00b1\n4.0 and 71.2\u00b12.8, respectively Table 2. Within each formation, CIA\nvalues for greywackes show reduced variation, ranging from 61.5 to\n74.0 in M\u00e9rtola greywackes and from 67.0 to 76.6 in Mira. Average\nCIA values for M\u00e9rtola and Mira shales are higher as compared to\ngreywackes (71.1\u00b13.5 and 78.1\u00b11.8, respectively) and also show a\nreduced range of variation (64.5\u201374.8 and 74.7\u201381.2, respectively).\nThe increased CIA values for shales of both formations should have\nresulted from prolonged chemical weathering associated with multi-\nple cycles of sedimentary recycling (see below). All together, CIA\nvalues for M\u00e9rtola and Mira greywackes and shales point out to\nmoderate weathering conditions at the source area. The reduced\n\nrange of variation of CIA values suggests steady-state weathering\nconditions in source area resulting from stable rates of chemical\nweathering and erosion over time (Nesbitt et al., 1997; Nesbitt,\n2003).\n\nBrejeira Formation shales exhibit average CIA values of 78.9\u00b11.0\n(77.3\u201380.2). CIA values for Brejeira greywackes show an average of\n74.6\u00b16.9 and vary from 63.3 to 83.0. Within this range, the highest\nCIA values are associated with samples from the base of the Brejeira For-\nmation, while lower values belong to the top of this unit. Collectively,\nthese values suggest moderate to intense chemical weathering condi-\ntions. The range of CIA values is clearly reflected in the A\u2013CN\u2013K\n(Al2O3?(CaO*+Na2O)?K2O) diagram, where Brejeira greywackes\nproject continuously along the ideal weathering trend parallel to A\u2013\nCN line (Fig. 9). The data point out to the non steady-state conditions\nof the source area weathering for the Brejeira Formation rocks, resulting\nfrom changing rates of chemical alteration and physical erosion over\ntime, probably as a consequence of tectonic instability in the source\narea (e.g., Nesbitt et al., 1997; Nesbitt, 2003; Lee, 2009).\n\nThe degree of source weathering and elemental distribution during\ndiagenesis can also be estimated using the related Plagioclase Index of\nAlteration (PIA) (Fedo et al., 1995), calculated using molar proportions\nof the following oxides: PIA=[(Al2O3?K2O)/(Al2O3+CaO*+Na2O?\nK2O)]\u00d7100, where CaO* is the amount of CaO incorporated in the silicate\nfraction of the rock only. Unweathered plagioclase has PIA value of 50,\nwhile Post Archaen Average Shale (PAAS) has PIA values of 79.\n\nM\u00e9rtola and Mira greywackes exhibit average PIA values of 69.9\u00b1\n6.5 (63.2\u201385.1) and 76.4\u00b14.3 (70.1\u201386.1), respectively. The Brejeira\ngreywackes show average PIA values of 82.5\u00b19.9 (67.2\u201394.6), indi-\ncating an increase in PIA values from the base to the top of the\nBAFG succession. The range of PIA values in these greywackes is a\nconsequence of a variable degree of conversion of feldspars to clay\nminerals. As expected, M\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira shales exhibit\nhigher PIA values compared to greywackes, respectively, 80.5\u00b15.4\n(70.4\u201388.5), 91.7\u00b12.4 (87.8\u201394.9) and 93.5\u00b11.6 (91.5\u201396.1),\nreflecting phyllosilicate-dominated mineralogy. Both CIA and PIA\nvalues suggest that from Middle Vis\u00e9an to Moscovian times, the\nsource area of the BAFG experienced variable chemical weathering\nconditions, which become more severe to the top of stratigraphic suc-\ncession, probably related to the tectonic instability in the provenance\narea (see discussion below).\n\n7. Source rock composition\n\nThe chemical composition of the source area for siliciclastic sedi-\nments can be inferred from the triangular diagram A\u2013CN\u2013K (Al2O3?\n(CaO*+Na2O)?K2O); where CaO* is the amount of CaO incorporated\nin the silicate-bearing minerals. As the weathering trends are parallel\nto the A\u2013CN boundary, a regression can be made by backward projec-\ntion relatively to the feldspar join line, to infer the composition of the\nsource area (Nesbitt and Young, 1984, 1989; Fedo et al., 1995).\n\nOn the A\u2013CN\u2013K diagram (Fig. 9) the M\u00e9rtola greywacke samples\nproject in several trends parallel to the A\u2013CN, where regression lines\nintercept plagioclase\u2013alkali feldspar join mainly along granodioritic\nand granitic source and to a lesser extent, basaltic source. Mira and\nBrejeira greywackes exhibit lower degree of dispersion, and the re-\ngression lines project between the fields of granodioritic and granitic\ncomposition. The shales from all three BAFG formations project\nalong the \u201ctrend\u201d defined by PAAS and North American Shale Compo-\nsition (NASC), within a granodioritic source composition (Fig. 9). The\nlow degree of dispersion between analyzed shales may also represent\na cumulative effect of multiple phases of sedimentary recycling\n(cf. McLennan et al., 1993). Accordingly, the shales from three BAFG\nformations exhibit low values of ICV (b1) and K2O/Al2O3 (~0.2) con-\nsistent with the predominance of clay minerals that may have resulted\nfrom a lower input of first cycle detritus coupled with the recycling of\nsedimentary material (Cox et al., 1995). This conclusion is also\n\nFig. 6. Classification of the BAFG greywackes according to Blatt et al. (1980).\n\n142 R.C.G.S. Jorge et al. / Sedimentary Geology 284\u2013285 (2013) 133\u2013148\n\n\n\nsupported by consistently higher CIA values for BAFG shales\nwhen compared with associated greywackes. In fact, as shown by\nMcLennan et al. (1990), in turbiditic sequences muds tend to have\nhigher CIA values than associated sands, as a consequence of extensive\n\nhistory of chemical weathering coupled to multiple cycles of sedimen-\ntary recycling.\n\nThe provenance of BAFG sediments can be also inferred from the\ngeochemistry of selected trace elements. This is based on the fact\n\nFig. 7. Variations of SiO2 versus Al2O3, K2O, Fe2O3 and MgO (wt.%), and of Al2O3 versus K2O (wt.%), Sc, V and Cr (ppm) for the BAFG rocks.\n\n143R.C.G.S. Jorge et al. / Sedimentary Geology 284\u2013285 (2013) 133\u2013148\n\n\n\nthat during weathering, erosion and transport, certain trace elements\nstay virtually insoluble and are transferred almost quantitatively to\nthe sedimentary record and, consequently, bear the signature of the\nparental rock (McLennan et al., 1983, 1993; Taylor and McLennan,\n\n1985; Bhatia and Crook, 1986; Feng and Kerrich, 1990; Cullers,\n1995; Armstrong-Altrin et al., 2012). Among all useful trace elements\n(e.g. Th, Sc and HFSE), the REE have the advantage of not being easily\nfractionated during the sedimentation process, allowing to consider\nthe REE pattern of siliciclastic rocks as an average representative of the\nsource area composition (McLennan, 1989; Cullers, 1995; Mongelli\net al., 1996; Bauluz et al., 2000). Additionally, the LREE/HREE ratio and\nthe Eu anomaly value vary according to the chemical composition of\nthe source. A majority of felsic rocks have variable degree of negative\nEu anomalies, while basic rocks show a small or inexistent negative Eu\nanomaly (Cullers et al., 1987; Cullers, 1995). The fine-grained sediments\nseem to preserve the size of the negative Eu anomalies (Cullers et al.,\n1987).\n\nThe normalized patterns of shales and greywackes from three\nBAFG formations are characterized by a sharp enrichment in LREE\nand the flattened HREE patterns (see Fig. 8 and Table 1 and 2). The\nEu/Eu* ratio ranges between 1.02\u20130.65 and 0.92\u20130.62 in greywackes of\nM\u00e9rtola and Mira formations, respectively. However, in greywackes\nfrom both formations only a limited number of samples exhibit small or\nabsent negative Eu/Eu* ratios. In shales, the Eu/Eu* values are 0.79\u20130.56\n(0.66\u00b10.07) in the M\u00e9rtola Formation and 0.85\u20130.66 (0.73\u00b10.05) in\nthe Mira Formation The range of Eu/Eu* values for both lithologies is\ncompatible with a heterogeneous source area of mostly felsic composi-\ntion with a minor contribution from basic rocks (see discussion below).\nThe Brejeira shales and greywackes exhibit less variable Eu/Eu* ratios,\n0.74\u20130.70 and 0.70\u20130.67, respectively, compatible with a plutonic felsic\nand/or reworked sedimentary source.\n\nAccording to Feng and Kerrich (1990) and McLennan et al. (1990),\nTh and Sc are particularly useful to constrain source area composition\nof siliciclastic rocks, largely because no fractionation is known to be\nassociated to these elements in the sedimentary cycle. Th and Sc are\nenriched in felsic and basic rocks, respectively, and their elemental\nratio is very sensitive to compositional variations associated to the\nprovenance area (McLennan et al., 1990). In addition, the Zr/Sc ratio\nis a reliable index of sedimentary recycling processes, because of the\nresistance of zircon to chemical weathering and erosion. In first\ncycle sediments, Th/Sc and Zr/Sc ratios tend to correlate positively,\ndepending on the source rock composition, while in more mature or\nrecycled rocks Zr/Sc varies considerably, contrasting with the small\n\nFig. 8.

On the Th/Sc\nversus Zr/Sc plot (Fig. 10) the BAFG rocks show considerable variation\nin Zr/Sc ratio, with a group of samples clustering close to the UCC and\nPAAS. Higher Zr/Sc ratios of Mira and Brejeira greywackes reflect Zr\nenrichment as a result of higher degree of sedimentary recycling,\nmost pronounced in the case of the Brejeira rocks.\n\nTo assess the degree of felsic vs. mafic contribution in the BAFG\nsediments, all samples were projected on Eu/Eu* versus Th/Sc diagram\n(Fig. 11). On this diagram, the majority of samples plot within the fields\nof unevolved felsic source and to a lesser extent, on evolved felsic\nsource. A small number of greywacke and shale samples from M\u00e9rtola\nand Mira Formation fall into the field of mafic source (Th/Scb0.5 and\nEu/Eu*>0.7) or on the boundary between the two fields. Samples with\nhigher Th/Sc ratios do not seem to contain any mafic contribution\n(Slack et al., 2004).\n\nThe La/Sc, Th/Sc, La/Co and Cr/Th ratios of different igneous and\nsedimentary rocks are shown in Table 3, in comparison to the BAFG\nrocks analyzed in this study. The diverse critical provenance ratios\nsuggest the predominance of felsic over mafic sources in the source\narea of the BAFG, with many of values close to the UCC.\n\n8. Paleotectonic setting\n\nTo identify the tectonic setting of ancient sedimentary basins, several\ngeochemical indicators and discriminating diagrams based on major and\ntrace elements have been proposed (e.g. Bhatia, 1983; Bhatia, and Crook,\n1986; Roser and Korsch, 1986, 1988). In these diagrams, sediments are\ngrouped into three or four categories based on their bulk geochemical sig-\nnal (e.g., oceanic island arc, continental arc, active continental margin,\nBhatia, and Crook, 1986). The widespread applicability of these geochem-\nical indicators for the interpretation of palaeotectonic settings has been\nfavored by some authors and questioned by others (e.g. Winchester and\nMax, 1989; McLennan et al., 1990, 1993; Floyd et al., 1991; Slack and\nStevens, 1994; Toulkeridis et al., 1999; Armstrong-Altrin and Verma,\n2005; Ryan and Williams, 2007).\n\nTo infer the palaeotectonic setting of the BAFG, all analyzed samples\nwere projected on the La\u2013Th\u2013Sc diagram proposed by Bhatia and Crook\n(1986), where the majority of shales and greywackes consistently\nproject within the continental island arc field, indicating a dissected\nmagmatic arc as a source terrane (Fig. 12). However, a small number\nof Brejeira greywackes plot outside the pre-defined fields.\n\nFloyd et al. (1991) proposed multi-element diagrams normalized to\nUCC to assess tectonic settings for coarse siliciclastic rock deposition,\nusing as a reference the average data for greywackes from common tec-\ntonic environments (Fig. 13). On these diagrams, the elements are ar-\nranged, from right to left, in order of increasing ocean residence times\nand fall into two groups, a more stable (Th\u2013Ta) and more mobile (Ni\u2013\nK) one. This approach allows the recognition of a number of source-\nand tectonic environment discriminating features: (i) the Nb/Nb* ratio\n(actual normalized Nb abundance divided by predicted normalized Nb\nabundance based on extrapolation between Ni and Ti), which is typically\nlow for sources derived from subduction-related magmatic rocks; the\nanomaly is less pronounced for passive margins involving reworked\ncontinental crust and is influenced by the contribution of mafic material\nin the source area; (ii) relative abundance of V, Cr, Ni, Ti and Sc: typical\nvalues for this anomaly are >1 for active margins and b1 for passive\nmargins; and (iii) relative abundance of Ti, Hf, Zr and Y: positive values\nof Ti\u2013Hf\u2013Zr\u2013Y anomaly reflect heavy mineral input (mainly zircon), and\nfor passive margins the values are >1 (Floyd et al., 1991).\n\nUsing the normalization proposed by Floyd et al. (1991, Fig. 13),\nthe greywackes of the three BAFG formations exhibit a generalized\ndepletion in Ta\u2013Nb and variable enrichment in V\u2013Cr\u2013Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Sc. V\nand Ni values for Brejeira greywackes are close to 1. The same is\ntrue for the Ni in the Mira greywackes. With the exception of M\u00e9rtola\ngreywackes, a positive anomaly in Hf\u2013Zr\u2013Y is observed, consistent\nwith the enrichment in heavy minerals. The enrichment in Hf\u2013Zr\u2013Y\n\nFig. 10.

The presence of these two types of signatures\nis common in active margins, where sedimentation is characterized by\na mixture of young arc-derived material of variable composition\nand old upper crustal material (McLennan et al., 1990, 1993). The\nUCC-normalized multi-elemental patterns observed in the three BAFG\nformations indicate the contribution of the SW border of the OMZ as\nan important source for these sediments, in agreement with the envi-\nronment of oblique collision between the SPZ and the SW border of\nthe OMZ. As a consequence of this collision, the SW border of the\nOMZ was rapidly uplifted during Carboniferous times (Oliveira et al.,\n2006; Jesus et al., 2007; Rosas et al., 2008). The rapid uplift and intense\nerosion to which this region was subjected since the late Tournaisian\nare well documented in the Cabrela and Toca da Moura sedimentary ba-\nsins (Pereira et al., 2006b). However, an intrabasinal (i.e., the IPB) input\nof sediments for the BAFG cannot be ruled out. As documented in this\nwork, the geochemical signatures of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira sediments in-\ndicate source area(s) dominated by granitoid composition with minor\ncontribution from mafic rocks. This granitoid signature could have had\norigin in the predominantly acidic volcanism of the IPB. The presence\nof acid and basic volcanic clasts in the greywackes also suggests a prov-\nenance from the Pyrite Belt (Schermerhorn, 1971; Oliveira, 1988;\nMoreno and Saez 1989, Moreno, 1993). However, previous studies de-\nnote the lack of evidence for large gravity sliding, olistrostomes and\nslump scars rooted in the IPB, and, together with the palaeocurrents\ndata in the M\u00e9rtola and Mira Formations (Oliveira, 1990), suggest a\nlimited provenance from the IPB, not enough to account for the huge\nvolume (more than 3 km in thickness) of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira sedi-\nments. In agreement, the UCC-normalized multi-elemental patterns of\nthe BAFG greywackes bear continental arc/active margin signatures,\nalso implying limited input from intrabasinal component.\n\nThe detrital modes and geochemistry of the Brejeira Formation\nsediments indicate an additional contribution from old upper conti-\nnental crustal source. These data can have two alternative interpreta-\ntions: i) an internal orogen source alone, or ii) with a contribution of\nan external source. At present, the petrographic and geochemical data\nalone are not sufficient to distinguish between the two alternatives;\nhowever, combined with the palaeocurrents measured in the Brejeira\nFormation, and with the stratigraphy of the SPD, they are more con-\nsistent with the latter. In fact, the mixed mud/carbonate platform of\nthe SPD was involved in the flysch sedimentation only in the late\nBashkirian and Moscovian times and the palaeocurrents of the\nBrejeira Formation indicate more varied directions of sediment trans-\nport, with flows from NNW to SSE and from S to N (Oliveira, 1990).\n\nIt has been suggested that the IPB and the SPD were part of\nthe Avalonia Plate (e.g., Martinez-Catal\u00e1n et al., 1997; Oliveira and\nQuesada, 1998; la Rosa et al., 2002; von Raumer et al., 2003; Ribeiro\net al., 2007; Jorge et al., 2012). The collision of this plate with the west-\nern (present coordinates) margin of the OMZ (an outboard part of\nGondwanan Iberia) in late Vis\u00e9an times brought to an end the volcanism\nin both plates, and was followed by tectonic inversion, uplifting in the\nOMZ and the development of a SW prograding trough in the Avalonia\nside. Our data are compatible with the view that, until the early\nBashkirian, this trough should have received eroded sediments from\nthe exhumed OMZ (e.g., Precambrian gneisses, Lower Palaeozoic gran-\nites and metasediments), and from Mississippian volcanic rocks from\nboth sutured plates. These sources contributed, in different proportions,\nto the bulk of the M\u00e9rtola and Mira rocks. From early Bashkirian on-\nwards the trough received a stronger contribution from the continental\ncrust of the Avalonia Plate as indicated by the predominantly felsic and\nrecycled signature of the Brejeira Formation sediments.\n\n9. Conclusions\n\nThe greywackes from the M\u00e9rtola and Mira formations show similar\nmodal compositions, while Brejeira greywackes are more enriched in\n\nFig. 13.

LILE contents in greywackes are generally\nlower than the UCC. Shales show a similar pattern, with generalized\nslight enrichment in K2O and variable depletion in MgO (except for\nthe M\u00e9rtola Formation), CaO and Na2O, enrichment in Rb, Ba and Cs,\nand depletion in Sr.\n\nA\u2013CN\u2013K diagrams and CIA and PIA values suggest that M\u00e9rtola\nand Mira Formations underwent moderate weathering in the source\nareas, where reduced variation of both palaeoweathering indices in-\ndicates steady-state weathering conditions. The youngest Brejeira\nFormation shows greater CIA and PIA variation, reflecting moderate\nto intense weathering as a consequence of a non-steady-state condi-\ntions. High CIA and PIA values of shales from the three BAFG forma-\ntions, and low ICV (b1) and K2O/Al2O3 (~0.2) ratios suggest a more\ncomplex history of chemical weathering associated with multiple cy-\ncles of sedimentary recycling. These data indicate that during Middle\nVis\u00e9an to Moscovian times, weathering conditions of source area(s)\nof BAFG sediments changed from moderate to intense probably as a\nconsequence of tectonic instability in the area.\n\nThe source area of M\u00e9rtola greywackes is heterogeneous, dominated\nby rocks with granitoid composition and minor mafic input. The mafic\ncomponent becomes residual in greywackes of Mira Formation, where\ngranitoid source predominates. Greywackes from the Brejeira Forma-\ntion exhibit a clear felsic signature with significant increase in recycled\ncomponents. All analyzed shales show geochemical features compatible\nwith provenance areas of mostly granodioritic composition.\n\nPetrographic analyses, geochemical signatures of major and trace\nelements and multi-element tectonic discriminant diagrams suggest\na continental arc/active margin as the most prominent origin for\nBAFG sediments. These data also indicate that an old upper continental\ncrust contributed to the sediments of the Mira and Brejeira formations,\nmore pronouncedly to the latter. Collectively, geochemical signatures of\nthree BAFG formations are compatible with provenance from the SW\nborder of Ossa Morena mostly, with possible contribution of an external\n(Avalonian) source.\n\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http://\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2012.12.005.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work is a contribution to the project POCI/CTE-GEX/60278/2004\nfinanced by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology\n(Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia \u2014 FCT).

Its faulted boundary against \nthe Ossa Morena Zone in the north is marked by the Beja Acebu-\nches Ophiolite and to the south it is overlain unconformably by \nMesozoic sedimentary rocks of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 1). The \nBeja Acebuches Ophiolite is interpreted as a remnant of the Rheic \nOcean that separated the Euramerican South Portuguese Zone from \nthe Gondwanan Ossa Morena Zone (Oliveira 1990; Quesada et al. \n1994; Oliveira &amp; Quesada 1998; Oliveira et al. 2006).\n\nThe South Portuguese Zone is divided into four \u2018domains\u2019 based \non lithology, deformation style and age. The domains trend from \nNW\u2013SE near the coast to east\u2013west inland and generally young \ntowards the SW. These domains are, from NE to SW, the Pulo do \nLobo Antiform, the Pyrite Belt, the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group \nand the Southwest Portugal Domain.\n\nThe Pulo do Lobo Formation crops out in the centre of the anti-\nformal structure of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform. It consists of highly \ndeformed phyllites and quartzites with small intercalations of \namphibolites of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-type geochemical \naffinity. Detrital zircons from the quartzites suggest a maximum \ndepositional age of 438 Ma (Silurian) for the protolith of this for-\nmation (Braid et al. 2011). Flysch-type successions crop out on the \nnorthern and southern flanks of the antiform. These rocks are dated \npalynologically as Frasnian to late Famennian (Pereira et al. 2006, \n2008). However, detrital zircons in the upper unit of the overlying \nflysch succession (the Santa \u00cdria Formation) located on the north-\nern limb of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform in Spain give a maximum \ndepositional age of Tournaisian (347 \u00b1 5.5 Ma, Braid et al. 2011), \ncompared with the late Famennian age provided by palynomorphs \nfor the same unit in Portugal (Pereira et al. 2006). This suggests \neastward progradation of flysch deposition during late Famennian \nto Tournaisian time, although this requires further investigation. \n\nVitrinite reflectance (VR) of the organic matter from the flysch \nsuccessions of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform indicates that meta-\nanthracite coal rank was attained post-late Devonian (Pereira et al. \n2006).\n\nThe Pyrite Belt succession consists of phyllites and quartzites of \nthe Phyllite Quartzite Group overlain by volcanic rocks and sedi-\nments of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex, which are often min-\neralized. Palynomorphs present in the uppermost beds of the \nPhyllite Quartzite Group indicate a Late Devonian age (Pereira \net al. 2008). The Volcano-Sedimentary Complex is dated as Late \nDevonian to late Vis\u00e9an based on palynomorphs and rare conodonts \n(Boogaard 1963, 1967; Oliveira &amp; Wagner Genthis 1983; Oliveira \net al. 2004, 2005; Pereira et al. 2007, 2008). VR values from the \nPyrite Belt in the S\u00e3o Domingos mine area range from 4.6 to 5.2% \nRr, indicating a meta-anthracite coal rank (Pereira et al. 2006).\n\nThe Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group is a turbiditic sequence over \n5 km thick that progrades southwards. The flysch sequence in the \nSouth Portuguese Zone is divided into three formations based on \nsedimentology and age. In ascending order these are the M\u00e9rtola, \nMira and Brejeira Formations. These units are dated by ammonoid \nfaunas and palynomorphs as late Vis\u00e9an, Serpukhovian to early \nBashkirian, and late Bashkirian to late Moscovian respectively \n(Oliveira et al. 1979, 1985; Korn 1997; Pereira 1999; Pereira et al. \n2007, 2008). The Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group represents the \ndevelopment of a foreland basin that formed as a result of the colli-\nsion of the South Portuguese Zone and the Ossa Morena Zone, with \nassociated tectonic stacking that propagated from NE to SW \n(Oliveira 1990; Silva et al. 1990; Pereira 1997, 1999). Reworked \nCambrian to Early Devonian palynomorphs occur commonly in the \nBrejeira Formation (Pereira 1999), indicating a source area for \nthese clastic sediments outside the South Portuguese Zone, as no \nrocks older than the Mid-Devonian crop out in the South Portuguese \n\nNew evidence concerning the thermal history of Devonian and Carboniferous rocks \nin the South Portuguese Zone\n\nPAULO F ERNANDES 1*, JENNIFER A.

Vitrinite reflec-\ntance determinations from 90 samples confirm that the organic maturity of Late Palaeozoic rocks in SW \nPortugal is very high, mainly corresponding to meta-anthracite coal rank. The optic fabric of vitrinite in \noriented coal samples from the Brejeira Formation suggests maturation under simple, non-tectonic, burial \nconditions with peak temperatures being attained prior to Variscan deformation. The lack of any increase in \nvitrinite reflectance with depth through c. 1 km of section in borehole AC-1 is not consistent with conduc-\ntive heat transfer and is interpreted as the result of late synorogenic to post-orogenic advective heating. This \nheating episode generated temperatures sufficiently high to produce levels of maturity corresponding to meta-\nanthracite coal rank through much of the terrane now exposed, but not high enough to result in overprinting of \nthe pre-deformation optic fabric of vitrinite in the thin coals. The slightly lower maturity of older, platform-\nfacies rocks in the Aljezur\u2013Bordeira area may reflect either deposition on a basement high followed by less \nburial than adjacent parts of the basin, or the area being the site of a sink for descending relatively cool fluids.\n\nresearch-articleResearch Article169X10.1144/jgs2011-156\n2012\n\n by guest on November 1, 2012http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/Downloaded from \n\nhttp://jgs.lyellcollection.org/\n\n\nP. FERNANDES  E T  A L .648\n\nZone. McCormack et al. (2007) published a comprehensive study \nof the thermal history of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group, deter-\nmining a mean VR of 4.28% Rr for this domain and suggesting that \nthe timing of maturation was post-Variscan deformation, within the \nlate Carboniferous\u2013late Triassic interval.\n\nThe Southwest Portugal Domain succession comprises Late \nDevonian quartzites and shales (Tercenas Formation) followed by \na mud-dominated carbonate platform sequence, the Carrapateira \nGroup, of Tournaisian to late Bashkirian age (Pereira 1999). A few \nsamples from the Tercenas Formation and from the Vis\u00e9an \nMurra\u00e7\u00e3o Formation indicate maturation levels of c. 3.2% Rr \n(McCormack 1998; McCormack et al. 2007), which are lower than \nthe mean maturation value of c. 4.83% Rr for the younger Brejeira \nFormation of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group. An inversion of \nthe VR values in these strata in the SWP was also described by \nMo\u00e7o et al. (1998), with the highest values being recorded in the \nBrejeira Formation (4.5% Rr) and lower values being recorded in \nthe older units of the Carrapateira Group (2.5\u20134% Rr).\n\nDiagenetic and metamorphic conditions within the South \nPortuguese Zone have also been studied by means of clay mineral \ncrystallinity (Munh\u00e1 1983, 1990; McCormack 1998; Abad et al. \n2001). These studies show a decrease in crystallinity from epizone \nconditions in the NE to the late diagenetic zone in the SW. The \nPulo do Lobo Formation in the core of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform \nis of greenschist facies, whereas the clastic units in both limbs \nattained epizone facies.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThe samples analysed in this study were obtained from outcrops \nand a mineral exploration borehole (AC-1). Black and grey shales \nwere the main lithologies sampled for maturation studies. A few \nthin coal lenses in fine-grained turbiditic beds in the Brejeira \nFormation were also sampled.\n\nThe dispersed organic matter in all of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch \nGroup mudrocks studied is dominated by amorphous organic mat-\nter and phytoclasts (vitrinite and inertinite). Framboidal pyrite \nalways appears as inclusions, normally associated with amorphous \norganic matter (AOM). Inertinite is an important constituent of the \ndispersed organic matter in some samples, although it is always \nless abundant than vitrinite.\n\nThe composition of the organic matter in the Southwest Portugal \nDomain mudrocks varies greatly between formations. AOM is the \ndominant constituent in the Quebradas and Bordalete formations. \nVitrinite and inertinite are important constituents of the dispersed \norganic matter in the sandstone-dominated interval at the top of the \nTercenas Formation. In the Murra\u00e7\u00e3o Formation, organic matter is \nscarce and is dominated by inertinite and AOM.\n\nBorehole AC-1\n\nBorehole AC-1 was drilled by Billiton Portugal Lta. in 1986 for \nmineral exploration. It reached a depth of c. 980 m (1064 m with \n\nFig. 1.

The upper c. 600 m consists of inter-\nbedded shales and greywackes of the M\u00e9rtola Formation. Below \n600 m, the succession comprises shales and fine and coarse volcani-\nclastic rocks of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex of the Iberian \nPyrite Belt. The M\u00e9rtola Formation section was extensively sampled, \nwith shale samples taken at an average spacing of 20 m. Only six \nsamples were taken from grey shales in the Volcano-Sedimentary \nComplex, the lowest from 729.5 m. The M\u00e9rtola Formation is assigned \nto the NM Miospore Biozone, of mid-late Vis\u00e9an age. Moderately \nwell-preserved specimens of Raistrickia nigra, a key species of the \nmiospore biozone are present. Samples from the Volcano-Sedimentary \nComplex did not provide any stratigraphically useful information.\n\nThe structural interpretation of borehole AC-1 suggests that no \nmajor fractures were intersected. Rocks of the M\u00e9rtola Formation \nand the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex are, generally, subhori-\nzontal or dipping gently to the SW, suggesting a non-faulted con-\ntact between the two units (Fig. 2). The faults penetrated were \nconsidered to be late reverse faults, with correlation of beds across \n\nthe faults suggesting very limited displacements (Fig. 2). Tectonic \ncleavage was also observed in the shaly intervals, dipping 30\u201340\u00b0 \nto the NE. Structural analysis of the data suggests that the borehole \npenetrated the normal limb of a regional anticline. These structural \nfeatures are typical of the southern branch of the Iberian Pyrite \nBelt, which is characterized by rooted folds (Silva et al. 1990).\n\nOutcrop samples\n\nVR was determined from 54 shale and two coal samples from out-\ncrops in the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group and Southwest Portugal \nDomain to determine the regional maturity and to elucidate the \nthermal evolution of the South Portuguese Zone.\n\nAt Pedras das Ameias, at the western end of the Arrifana harbour \nsection (Fig. 3), interbedded greywackes and shales of the Brejeira \nFormation include occasional very thin (<1 cm) coal lenses. The \nsection is dominated by numerous NW\u2013SE-trending folds from \nwhich field-oriented coal samples were taken on both vertical and \nsubhorizontal limbs.\n\nExtraction techniques and methods of study\n\nOrganic particles were extracted from the rock samples using \nstandard cold hydrofluoric acid (HF) techniques. The organic resi-\ndues obtained were then mounted and polished using a method \nadopted from that described by Hillier &amp; Marshall (1988).\n\nMean random vitrinite reflectance (%Rr) was the VR parameter \nchosen for maturation assessment of shales because the mounting \ntechnique used provides non-oriented vitrinite particles and also \nbecause %Rr is the most widely used organic maturation parameter. \nVR measurements on most of the samples were made using an \nOlympus BX 51 microscope equipped with a black and white digital \ncamera. The black and white (8-bit) digital images of vitrinite parti-\ncles were analysed using a MatLab routine. This routine is a graphi-\ncal tool that runs within the Mirone suite (Luis 2007) and calibrates \nthe scale of 256 grey levels with standards of known reflectivity \n(Fernandes et al. 2010). The reflectance values of the standards used \nwere 0.428, 0.595, 1.715, 3.150 and 5.370%. VR was measured in \nincident light with a wavelength of 546 nm and immersion oil with \na refractive index of 1.518. Reflectances of the oriented coal sam-\nples from Pedras das Ameias were measured using the techniques \nand equipment described by McCormack et al. (1998).\n\nVitrinite reflectance results\n\nFigure 1 shows the new VR results from outcrop samples together \nwith results from McCormack et al. (2007). Results from borehole \nAC-1 are shown in Figure 2. The Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group rocks \ncropping out in the South Portuguese Zone do not display great vari-\nability in VR, with Rr ranging from 3.80 to 5.55%. The majority of VR \nvalues range from 4.0 to 5.0% Rr, corresponding to meta-anthracite \ncoal rank. There is no clear correlation between the Rr means in the \nthree formations investigated. This is even more marked if peak palae-\notemperatures calculated by Barker &amp; Goldstein\u2019s (1990) empirical \nequations are compared, with a difference of less than 10 \u00b0C between \nthe mean peak palaeotemperature for the three formations (Table 1). \nThe mean peak palaeotemperatures for the M\u00e9rtola, Mira and Brejeira \nformations are 311, 302 and 310 \u00b0C respectively. The palaeotempera-\ntures do not show any consistent change, in relation to stratigraphic \nposition within the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group.\n\nThe geographical distribution of Rr values for the rocks of the \nBaixo Altentejo Flysch Group suggests that there is not a clear \ndepocentre for this unit. This is consistent with the synsedimen-\ntary tectonic model proposed by Oliveira (1990) for the South \n\nFig. 2.

The lack of downhole increase in VR in the bore-\nhole precludes the calculation of a meaningful regional palaeogeo-\nthermal gradient in the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group.\n\nFor optic fabric determination of the coal lenses at Pedra das \nAmeias (Fig. 3), three orthogonal faces were cut and polished on \neach sample; (a) parallel to bedding; (b) perpendicular to bedding \nand parallel to strike; (c) perpendicular to bedding and parallel to \ndip. Measurements made on these three surfaces revealed uniaxial \nnegative vitrinite reflectance indicatrices (VRIs) with maximum \nreflectance (Rmax) parallel to bedding and minimum reflectance \n(Rmin) perpendicular to bedding, even where the dip was close to \nvertical (85\u00b0). In the case of a vertical coal lens investigated, Rmax is \n6.29%, Rmin (b) is 3.72% and Rmin (c) is 3.83%.\n\nThe results from the oriented coal samples support the interpre-\ntation published by McCormack et al. (2007), but are more con-\nvincing as they are based on a more extreme range of dips.  \nThe uniaxial negative VRIs recorded are \u2018typical of coalification  \nin tectonically undeformed subsiding basins\u2019 (Taylor et al. 1998; \nafter Levine &amp; Davis 1989). There is no trace of later modification \nproducing biaxial positive or negative VRIs that would indicate \nfurther coalification during intense or even incipient tectonism. \n\nFurther coalification during a post-tectonic vertical loading regime \n(i.e. post-Variscan burial of the section) might be expected to result \nin complete or partial rotation of the VRIs in the vertical limbs to a \nposition where Rmax is horizontal but this was not observed. The \nimplication of this evidence is that maximum temperatures were \nattained prior to initiation of deformation.\n\nThe organic maturation of the Southwest Portugal Domain has \nnot been as comprehensively studied as the Baixo Altentejo Flysch \nGroup. The VR measurements from SW Portugal are from rocks \ncropping out in the Aljezur and Bordeira inliers. Here, the \nFamennian Tercenas Formation has a mean of 3.37% Rr, the \nTournaisian Bordalete Formation a mean of 3.26% Rr, the Vis\u00e9an \nMurra\u00e7\u00e3o Formation 4.34% Rr and the Serpukhovian to Bashkirian \nQuebradas Formation a mean of 3.52% Rr. With the exception of \nthe Murra\u00e7\u00e3o Formation, the VR values measured for the Southwest \nPortugal Domain are in general 1% Rr lower than the average  \nvalues of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group rocks of the same age \n(Table 1). Although VR suppression could be invoked to explain \nthe low values obtained from the predominantly shaly Quebradas \nFormation, this is most unlikely at such high levels of maturity and \nthe same mechanism cannot be applied to the other coarser-grained \nformations. More likely explanations for the low Rr values observed \nare that either the platform-facies sediments of the Aljezur\u2013\nBordeira area were a \u2018sink\u2019 for descending, relatively cool fluids, or \nthat this area was situated on a persistent basement high and was \nless deeply buried than adjacent areas.\n\nFig. 3.

FERNANDES  E T  A L .652\n\nThermal history\n\nHigh maturity in Western European Late Palaeozoic rocks has been \nnoted by several researchers. For example, Cornford et al. (1987), \ndescribed VR in the Culm Basin of SW England ranging from 4.4 \nto 5.6%. Those workers attributed the high values to a combination \nof several factors: burial, Variscan thrusting and the emplacement \nof the Dartmoor Granite. The Culm succession of turbidites and \nsubsidiary black shales is closely comparable in age, facies and \nmaturity with the Mira and Brejeira formations in SW Portugal \n(Oliveira &amp; Quesada 1998). Hower &amp; Gayer (2002) drew attention \n\nto the importance of advective heating in Palaeozoic foreland \nbasins, based on four case studies from the USA, South Wales and \nAustralia. A model that is consistent with our results in SW Portugal \nis discussed below and illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nPre-Variscan\n\nOur data suggest that the attainment of peak temperatures during \nlate Pennsylvanian time was the consequence of simple, pre- \ntectonic burial. The high maturity of rocks towards the top of the \nPennsylvanian succession (Table 1) necessitates a high geothermal \n\nFig. 4.

(2006) sug-\ngested that magma trapped in the mid-crust within the Iberian \nVariscides produced high geothermal gradients and postulated the \ndevelopment of a mantle plume in early Carboniferous time. \nDoblas et al. (1998) also inferred the existence of a pan-European \nmantle plume but based this on the geochemistry of volcanic rocks \nand suggested that this was a later (latest Carboniferous\u2013early \nPermian) event. However, if the advective fluid flow system \ndescribed below was operative in late Carboniferous time, it could \nhave produced a sufficiently high geothermal gradient to explain \nthe observed maturity of the Late Palaeozoic units in SW Portugal, \nobviating the need for any mantle plume.\n\nVariscan\n\nTemperatures remained high but did not exceed the maximum \nattained before Variscan deformation. The evidence for this is the \noptic fabric determined from the oriented coal samples from \nArrifana. Advective heating by hot fluids expelled during \nVariscan folding and thrusting produced relatively uniform high \ntemperatures in the upper crust, overprinting any existing vertical \nVR gradient.\n\nIn the Brejeira Formation (incorrectly identified by Zulauf et al. \n2011 as the M\u00e9rtola Formation), fluid inclusions from vertical and \nhorizontal veins genetically related to Variscan folding indicate \npeak temperatures of 200 \u00b1 20 \u00b0C for vertical veins and 230 \u00b1 22 \u00b0C \nfor horizontal veins. Palaeotemperatures calculated from VR in \nthe present study are in the range of 276\u2013325 \u00b0C with mean 304 \u00b0C \nin the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group (Table 1), supporting our \ncontention that peak temperatures were achieved prior to Variscan \ndeformation but still remained high during and after deformation.\n\nPost-Variscan\n\nEvidence for high temperatures having been maintained for \nsome time after deformation is provided by the similarity of VR \nin Carboniferous rocks at the surface throughout SW Portugal, \nregardless of their stratigraphic age. In borehole AC-1, the lack \nof any downhole increase in VR through c. 700 m of section is \nnot consistent with conductive heating in a \u2018normal\u2019 burial mat-\nuration regime but suggests advective heat transfer. Based on \nhydrogeological modelling, Gayer et al. (1998) attributed the \nanthracite rank of parts of the South Wales Coalfield to \u2018topo-\ngraphically driven fluid flow systems that developed soon after \nthe climax of the Variscan orogeny\u2019. Those workers also sug-\ngested a very short (1\u20132 Ma) duration for the flow system after \nmaximum uplift.\n\nWe suggest that a similar fluid flow regime in the Late Palaeozoic \nunits of SW Portugal was established, driven by thrusting and tec-\ntonic stacking to the north in the Pulo do Lobo Antiform and the \nnorthern branch of the Pyrite Belt (Silva et al. 1990). The anoma-\nlously low maturity of platform-facies rocks in the Aljezur\u2013\nBordeira antiforms may be a consequence of this area having been \na \u2018sink\u2019 for descending, relatively cool fluids.\n\nVariscan deformation was clearly followed by uplift and erosion \nbut the timing of this is poorly constrained. Late Triassic sediments \nand volcanic rocks unconformably overlie deformed and highly \nmature Devonian and Carboniferous strata throughout SW Portugal. \nThe much lower maturity of the Triassic units (c. 1.1% Rr) is due to \nMesozoic burial (McCormack et al. 2007). Mesozoic re-burial of the \nalready highly mature Late Palaeozoic rocks did not elevate their \ntemperatures sufficiently to further increase their maturity.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe organic maturity of the Late Palaeozoic rocks of SW Portugal is \nvery high, mainly corresponding to meta-anthracite coal rank. The \nslightly lower maturity of older, platform-facies rocks in the Aljezur\u2013\nBordeira antiforms resulted either from this area having been a sink \nfor desending, relatively cold fluids or from less burial than adjacent \nparts of the basin. The optic fabric of vitrinite in oriented coal sam-\nples from the Brejeira Formation indicates maturation under simple, \nnon-tectonic burial conditions; that is, peak temperatures were \nattained prior to Variscan deformation. The high maturity of samples \nfrom close to the top of the preserved Pennsylvanian (Moscovian) \nsection suggests an anomalously high late Carboniferous geothermal \ngradient. The lack of any increase in VR through c. 700 m of section \nin borehole AC-1 is not consistent with conductive heat transfer but \nsuggests advective heating. Mesozoic re-burial of the Late Palaeozoic \nrocks had no effect on their already high maturity.\n\nThis work is a contribution to the project POCI/CTE-GEX/60278/2004 \nfinanced by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology \n(Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia; FCT).

In this research, \ngeochemical studies have been carried out on Portuguese \ncoastal sands aiming to ascertain its use for forensic purposes.  \n\nRare Earth Elements (REE) concentrations were \ndetermined on samples collected on three coastal areas \nsurrounded by different geological contexts, namely \nlimestone, granite and metasediment. Eight sand samples were \ncollected along transects perpendicular to the coastline, in \nbeach and dune from each site. Each sample was manually \ncollected with a plastic spade from the surface sediment, at a \ndepth of approximately 0-5cm. From the sediment samples a \nstandardized particle size fraction of&lt;150 \u00b5m was obtained \nby dry sieving method and subsequently grinded to minimise \nthe variation in the geochemical properties due to particle size.  \n\nThe REE composition fraction was determined using four \nacid digestions ultratrace ICP-MS analysis at ACME labs \n(Canada), and concentrations calculated. Although the \nmeasured REEs concentrations can be compared directly for \nforensic purposes a normalisation reported to condrite \nmeteorites was performed [1]. \n\nA REEs normalised concentration and a hierarchical \ncluster analyses were performed to obtain discrimination \nbetween samples. They reveal differences between samples \nassociated with different geological context, and permitted the \ndiscrimination between samples surrounded by granite from \nsamples surrounded by limestone and metasediments. It was \nalso possible to discriminate some of the samples based on \ntheir REE concentration and profile. \n\n \nThis research was supported by Project PTDC/CTE-\n\nGEX/67442/2006 of FCT (Portugal). \n \n[1] Taylor &amp; McLennan (1985) Blackwell Scientific \nPublications, 312p. \n\n \n\nGeochemical signatures in detrital \ntourmalines as indicators for \n\nsediment provenance: The Baixo \nAlentejo Flysch Group, South \n\nPortuguese Zone \nB.

Geologia, Fac. Ci\u00eancias da \n\nUniversidade de Lisboa (rjorge@fc.ul.pt) \n \n\nMicroprobe analyses were made to infer the source of \ndetrital tourmalines from the Mid to Late Carboniferous \nturbiditic deposits of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group \n(BAFG) of the South Portuguese Zone. A representative group \nof greywacke samples covering the whole range of the BAFG \nages was collected for this study. Tourmalines have brown to \nbrownish gray colors and do not show any optical zonation. In \nthe Fe-Mg-Al diagram, the tourmalines fall into the fields of \nCa-poor metapelites, metapsammites and quartz-tourmaline \nrocks. Microprobe analyses revealed a range of values \nbetween schorl and dravite end members, being closer to the \nlatter, with variable contents of X-site vacancies (0.05-0.255 \napfu), Ca (0.078-0.2 apfu), Na (0.627-0.924 and Al (5.746-\n6.622 apfu). The Fe/(Fe+Mg) and Na/(Na+Ca) ratios range \nfrom 0.32-0.45 and 0.79-0.91, respectively. \n\nThe presence of well-rounded tourmaline grains suggests \nthat they could have derived from a source located at a great \ndistance from the sedimentary basin, or from reworked \nsedimentary rocks. The occurrence of few euhedral grains \nindicates minor contribution from first cycle sediments. \nTogether, these data suggest that the detrital BAFG \ntourmalines derived from multiple sources with the \npredominance of rocks with a felsic composition.  \n \n\nBruno Rodrigues holds a PhD grant from the Portuguese \nFoundation for Science and Technology \n(n.\u00b0 SFRH/BD/62213/2009). \n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX II \n\nVitrinite reflectance histograms \n\n\n\nAR2 MM3\n\nJVN1 JVN2\n\nJVN4\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr\n\nV\nitr\n\nin\nite\n\n p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\nV\n\nitr\nin\n\nite\n p\n\nar\ntic\n\nle\ns\n\nV\nitr\n\nin\nite\n\n p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\nANNEX II\n\n\n\nCST1-475 m CST1-526 m\n\nCST1-584 m RIT2\n\nVNC2 VNC3\n\nIC1-2 BA1\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\nV\nitr\n\nin\nite\n\n p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\nV\n\nitr\nin\n\nite\n p\n\nar\ntic\n\nle\ns\n\nV\nitr\n\nin\nite\n\n p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\nV\n\nitr\nin\n\nite\n p\n\nar\ntic\n\nle\ns\n\nANNEX II\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n\n\nCST1-582 m CST1-646 m\n\nCST1-677 m CT1-46 m\n\nCT1-108 m CT1-141 m\n\nCT1-314 m CT1-359 m\n\nV\nitr\n\nin\nite\n\n p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\nV\n\nitr\nin\n\nite\n p\n\nar\ntic\n\nle\ns\n\nV\nitr\n\nin\nite\n\n p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\nV\n\nitr\nin\n\nite\n p\n\nar\ntic\n\nle\ns\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\nANNEX II\n\n\n\nCST1-13 m CST1-56 m\n\nCST1-88 m CST1-211 m\n\nCST1-281 m CST1-354 m\n\nCST1-401 m CST1-483 m\n\nANNEX II\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\n%Rr %Rr\n\nV\nitr\n\nin\nite\n\n p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\nV\n\nitr\nin\n\nite\n p\n\nar\ntic\n\nle\ns\n\nV\nitr\n\nin\nite\n\n p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\nV\n\nitr\nin\n\nite\n p\n\nar\ntic\n\nle\ns\n\n\n\n\n\nANNEX III \n \n\nDetrital zircon U-Pb data \n \n\n\n\nANNEX\t\n \u00a0III\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0Detrital\t\n \u00a0zircon\t\n \u00a0U-\u00ad?Pb\t\n \u00a0Data\t\n \u00a0\n\nGrain 207Pb/235U 207Pb/235U \u00b1Ma 206Pb/238U 206Pb/238U \u00b1Ma discordance U conc\nnumber ratio age (Ma) (2?) ratio age (Ma) (2?)
