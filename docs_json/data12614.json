Two collections of materials were\ndone in alternate days. Semen and urine samples were separated in aliquots for: direct visualization in dark field\nmicroscopy; inoculation in hamsters (for semen only); isolation in culture media; and PCR. No hamster was\npositive by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT); kidney and liver fragments from the hamsters were used\nin an isolation attempt in culture media, with one positive isolation from the kidney of a hamster inoculated with\nsemen of one bull, and from liver of hamsters inoculated with semen of three bulls. Isolation in culture was\nnegative for all semen samples, but positive for five urine samples by direct inoculation. In PCR there was no\npositive result for semen samples, and only one urine sample was positive, which was coincident with one of the\npositive cultures. It was not possible to visualize leptospires in any of the samples by dark field microscopy.\n\nKey words: Leptospira, semen, urine, PCR\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAmong many diseases linked to reproduction, leptospirosis\nis one of the most important for the low productivity of cattle\nfarming. Transmission of Leptospira spp. in cattle can happen\nin an indirect way through contact with contaminated water or\nsoil, and directly through sexual contact. Once infected, the\nanimal excretes the agent by the urine over a period of time\nwhich can be longer than one year and presents an intermittent\ncharacter (14,21).\n\nThe presence of Leptospira spp. in semen of infected bulls\nwas demonstrated naturally and experimentally, indicating the\npossibility of bovine leptospirosis transmission by natural\ncoition or by artificial insemination (15,20).\n\nAround the world the criterion for leptospirosis diagnosis\nis a negative result by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).\n\nHowever, such condition is not an absolute assurance of\nabsence of kidney infection. Hanson (8) reports an isolation of\nLeptospira spp. from urine or kidney tissue of serologically\nunreactive animals. Serology does not necessarily reflects the\nstate of Leptospira carrier in bovines (23). Although MAT is a\nsensitive test, determining the serogroup involved, some\ndisadvantages can be observed. The most important is the fact\nthat it is an indirect test, which does not detect the presence of\nleptospires, but the immunological reaction of the infected host.\nThus, the test does not indicate if the infection is active.\n\nA definitive diagnosis of Leptospira spp. infection is usually\ngiven by cultivation and isolation of the agent; however, this\nprocedure is expensive, demanding freshly collected samples,\nand at least 30 days are required to obtain conclusive results\n(1). Thiermann (21) reported that Leptospira spp. isolation,\nbeyond the difficult execution, is dependent on factors like type\n\n*Corresponding Author.

Magajevski et al.\n\nand uniformity of medium used, and the experience of the\ntechnician.\n\nDue to the need of developing methods that offer greater\nsensitivity, specificity and speed, molecular biology techniques\nhave been applied to detect leptospires.\n\nRecently, the PCR technique became an important tool to\ndetect infectious agents. It is a quick and extremely sensitive\nmethod that theoretically can detect a single DNA molecule in a\nfew hours. Another great advantage of PCR is the fact that there\nis no need of viability of the pathogen for the use of the test,\nwhich allows inactivation and storage of samples, as well as\napplication of the technique in poorly preserved samples (13).\n\nPCR has been used successfully in several studies related\nto leptospirosis, either for detection of the agent in several\nmaterials, such as semen (9,18), urine (3,12,23) and aqueous\nhumor (4), or to monitor leptospires density in blood and organs\nof experimentally infected hamsters treated with different doses\nof antibiotics (22).\n\nThe present study had as objective to evaluate the PCR\ntechnique for the diagnosis of bovine leptospirosis by detection\nof Leptospira in urine and semen of bulls serologically reactive\nto the serovar hardjo, comparing it with the results obtained by\nMAT and culture and isolation of the microorganism.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nExamined animals\nThe study was carried out with 10 semen donor bulls (Bos\n\ntaurus) from an artificial insemination center located in the State\nof S\u00e3o Paulo. Animals serologically reactive to Leptospira\ninterrogans serovar hardjo in two examinations one week apart,\naccording to the routine of the insemination center, from March\n2001 to July 2002, were selected; the lowest antibody titer for\nselection of an animal was 200. This titer was adopted to increase\nthe possibility of finding leptospires in the materials studied.\n\nSample collection\nBlood collection was performed by vein puncture, and the\n\nserum removed from the collected blood after clot retraction.\nThen the serum was identified and tested by the microscopic\nagglutination test (MAT).\n\nTwo semen samples from bulls reacting by the MAT were\nobtained, with a 3-day maximum interval, by the artificial vagina\nmethod.\n\nUrine samples were collected from serologically reacting\nbulls by the technique of preputial massage immediately after\nsemen collection.\n\nMicroscopic agglutination test\nThe sera were diluted in S\u00f6rensen buffered solution, with\n\nan initial dilution of 1/50. From this dilution 50 ?L aliquots were\nplaced in test tubes, and an equal amount of antigen added,\n\nresulting in a 1/100 dilution. The mixture serum-antigen was\ngently mixed and incubated in a bacteriological incubator at\n28\u00baC for two hours, and then read in a dark field microscope,\nwith a 40x objective and a 15x eye piece. The criterion adopted\nto consider a serum reactive was 50% agglutination, that is, at\nleast one half of the leptospires agglutinated in the microscope\nfield at the amplification of 100 times (17). The reactive sera in\nthe initial screening were reexamined with seven serial dilutions\nat the proportion of two, and only the animals with sera\npresenting a minimum titer of 200 were used. The serum titer\nwas considered as the reciprocal of the greatest dilution that\npresented at least 50% agglutination.\n\nDetection of the agent\nThe detection of leptospires in semen and urine was\n\nperformed by: a) direct examination of semen suspensions, in\nan optical microscope with a 10x eye piece, and a 40x objective,\nand immersion dark field condenser (17); b) cultivation of\nleptospires in culture media with the serial dilution procedure\n(5); and c) extraction and detection of leptospire genetic material\nby the PCR technique. Isolation of leptospires was also\nperformed by inoculation of 0.5 mL of semen, intraperitonealy,\nin male hamsters (Mesocricetos auratus) with 80 to 120 mg live\nweight, and attempts of recovering the microorganisms from\nthe kidneys and liver.\n\nFor the agent cultivation, semen and urine samples were\nprocessed as fast as possible (less than two hours time frame),\nand they were frozen at -20\u00baC until required for PCR examination.\n\nDetection of antibodies and attempt to isolate leptospires in\nhamsters\n\nTwenty one days after semen inoculation as described above,\nall hamsters, inoculated and controls (with application of sterile\nS\u00f6rensen solution), were individually anaesthetized in a chamber\nwith ethyl ether vapors. Blood samples were collected by cardiac\npuncture, to detect antibodies against the serovar hardjo by\nthe MAT; subsequently, a rigorous asepsis of the abdominal\nregion was followed by a median laparotomy for removal of\nkidneys and liver of each hamster. Approximately 1g of each\naseptically collected organ was individually macerated in a sterile\nmortar and pestle, and suspended in 9 mL of sterile S\u00f6rensen\nsolution.\n\nIsolation in culture media\nStarting from five serial dilutions at the proportion of 10,\n\nwith sterile S\u00f6rensen buffered solution, from a 0.5 mL aliquot of\neach studied sample (urine, semen, and hamster organ\nsuspensions), cultivation of leptospires was done by seeding\neach dilution in Fletcher\u2019s (Difco) semisolid medium, amended\nwith 5-fluorouracil (Hoffman \u2013 Roche), in the proportion of\n200 \u00b5g/mL (5). After seeding, the tubes were incubated at 28\u00baC\nfor 12 weeks, observing the occurrence of an opalescence ring\n\n\n\nDetection of Leptospira spp\n\n4 5\n\nand weekly dark field microscopy studies were performed with\na 40x objective and a 15x eye piece.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nDNA extraction was done by enzymatic lysis with proteinase\n\nK followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol from 300 ?L\nof each sample (semen and urine); the DNA extraction steps\nwere done basically as describe by Sambrook et al. (16).\n\nThe primer used was that proposed by Merien et al. (11),\ncorresponding to nucleotides 38 to 57 (5\u2019GGCGGCGC\nGTCTTAAACATG 3\u2019) and 348 to 369 (5\u2019TTCCCCCATTGA\nGCAAGATT 3\u2019) of the 16 S rRNA gene primary structure of\nthe Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola.\n\nDNA sample amplification was done in 500 ?L microtubes,\nwith a 50 ?L final volume. The reaction mixture consisted of\n18.7 ?L ultrapure water, 5.0 ?L 10x reaction buffer (500 mM KCl;\n15 mM MgCl2; 100 mM tris-HCl, pH 9.0), 8.0 ?L dNTPs mixture\n(200 mM of each nucleotide [dCTP, dATP, dGTP, dTTP]), 4.0 ?L\neach oligonucleotide (10 pmol/?L), 0.3 ?L Taq DNA-polymerase\n(5 units per ?L) and 10 ?L extracted DNA sample, and the mixture\nwas placed in a thermocycler.\n\nThe amplification cycle used was the one recommended by\nMerien et al. (11), added with an initial step at 94\u00baC for 5 minutes.\n\nVisualization of the amplified product (330 base pairs) was\ndone by electrophoresis in a 2.0% (w/v) agarose gel stained\nwith ethidium bromide, using TBE 0.5 X (0.04 M tris-acetate and\n0.001M EDTA, pH 8.0) as running buffer (16).\n\nRESULTS\n\nBy the direct dark field microscopy it was not possible to\nobserve any leptospires in the 20 semen samples nor in the 18\nurine ones, collected in duplicate from each one of the 10\nserologically reactive bulls.\n\nBy the leptospires cultivation in culture media technique, no\nmicroorganisms were seen in the few semen cultures that did not\nget contaminated. It was possible to visualize leptospires in urine\ncultures of five bulls, in at least one of the collections (Table 1).\n\nThe results from Fletcher\u2019s semisolid medium culture of kidney\nand liver samples of hamsters inoculated with fresh \u201cin natura\u201d\nsemen are presented in Table 1. They were grouped as a pool for\neach group of three hamsters that were inoculated with semen of\nthe same bull and the same collection. It can be seen from Table\n1 that Leptospira visualization was possible only from kidney\ncultures of hamsters that were inoculated with semen from bull 2\nin both collections; however, it was possible cultivated\nleptospires in liver cultures of hamsters inoculated with semen\nfrom three bulls, in at least one collection. All tested hamsters\nwere negative at the MAT. Negative results were obtained from\ncultures of liver and kidney of hamsters, as well as for MAT.\n\nAll positive cultures (urine of bulls, liver and kidney of\nhamsters) were confirmed by PCR.\n\nIt was not possible to detect bacterial DNA by PCR technique\nfrom the semen samples. Table 1 shows the PCR results from\nurine samples of Leptospira reactive bulls. It can be seen in the\nTable that the sample from second collection of bull 4 was the\nonly one positive.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nUndoubtedly, leptospirosis is one of the major diseases of\nthe reproductive tract in cattle in Brazil and around the world,\nand the participation of semen as one of the dissemination\nvehicles was confirmed by several authors (15,20), thus,\nrequiring strict disease control in bulls which semen is used for\nartificial insemination, also caring for semen quality and the\nabsence of leptospires in this material.\n\nLeptospira spp. research in freshly collected semen and\nurine by direct dark field microscopy did not allow the\nvisualization of leptospires in any of the two semen and urine\nsamples of each animal. Direct visualization is very difficult,\nand a negative result does not mean absence of infection.\n\nTable 1.

Magajevski et al.\n\nLeptospira spp. isolation from semen samples was\nunsuccesessfull, with almost all cultivations being contaminated,\neven dilutions of 10-5. Similar frustrating results were obtained by\nGuimar\u00e3es et al. (7) and Heinemann et al. (9). The failure of\nLeptospira isolation from the analyzed semen samples could be\nexplained by the possible competition exerted by inhibitory and\ncontaminant microorganisms present in this material (19). However,\nBrod et al. (2) evaluated semen of several sires and found that it\nwas possible to observe leptospires during a direct examination\nafter 24 hours of cultivation in a semisolid medium.\n\nOn the other hand, it was possible to detect leptospires in\nurine cultures from five bulls, in at least one of the collections.\nThe fact that for the same bull it was possible to visualize\nLeptospira spp. in one collection, but not in another, could be\nexplained by the intermittent character of leptospiruria (14), and\nalso by the fact that possible contaminants inhibiting leptospires\ngrowth could be present in the urine. Thiermann (21) reported\nthat a Leptospira spp. isolating in culture medium, besides being\ndifficult to perform, is dependent on factors such as: type and\nuniformity of culture medium, and technician\u2019s experience.\n\nIn relation to the results of hamster inoculation with freshly\ncollected semen, it was observed that the passage of material in\nlaboratory animals could be a good alternative for isolation of\nLeptospira spp. from semen, which was also observed by\nKiktenko et al. (10). Although the animals did not present any\nclinical alteration and the microscopic agglutination test at a 1/\n100 dilution of the sera turned negative, it was possible to\nvisualize leptospires from kidney cultivation of a hamster group\nthat received semen from one of the bulls, and from liver\ncultivation of hamster groups that received semen of three bulls.\n\nThe fact that the control group animals were MAT negative,\nand that it was not possible cultivate leptospires from kidney or\nliver, indicate that the hamsters did not present leptospirosis\nbefore inoculation.\n\nAthough MAT is the most used technique for leptospirosis\ndiagnosis, it presents some deficiencies, such as: false-negative\nresults due to the low correlation between the carrier state and\nthe presence of serum antibodies (23), difficulty of obtaining\nreproducible results between laboratories (21), and it is a time\nconsuming technique, requiring the use of live leptospires as\nantigens (17).\n\nFacing the deficiencies of MAT, the unspecificity, and the\ninadequacy of direct visualization of leptospires by dark field\nmicroscopy, and the difficulty of cultivating Leptospira spp.\nfor isolation from several materials (21), PCR became a new\ndiagnosis option, which is considered fast and extremely\nsensitive, theoretically being able to detect a single DNA\nmolecule, since it passes through an amplification process.\n\nThis study has as major objective to evaluate PCR for the\ndetection of leptospires in semen and urine of serologically\nreactive bulls. For this purpose, the initiator oligonucleotides\nLep 1 and Lep 2, synthesized by Merien et al. (11) from the\n\nLeptospira interrogans serovar canicola sequence of gene\nrRNA 16 S as determined by Fukunaga et al. (6), was selected,\ndue to the fact that these primers were genus specific and allow\nthe amplification of several serovars of non-pathogenic and\npathogenic leptospires, including among them the serovars\nwolffi, hardjo, and pomona (9).\n\nAlthough there are several successful reports of Leptospira\nspp. detection by PCR in semen (9,18) and urine (3,11,23), in the\npresent study none of the semen samples were positive by\nPCR. For the urine samples, it was possible to detect Leptospira\nspp. DNA in only one, which was also positive for isolation.\nTheoretically, PCR can detect only one fragment of DNA, but\nsome papers described different detection threshold, that is\nvariable according to the sample, DNA extraction protocols and\nthe primer used. Heinemann et al. (10) reported a detection\nthreshold of 100 leptospires / mL in semen samples of bulls,\nwith the same primers used in the present study.\n\nNew studies should be done in relation to the use of PCR for\nthe diagnosis of leptospires in materials such as semen and\nurine, testing other DNA extraction methods, and other primers,\nsince the results from this paper showed that sometimes isolation\nin culture medium or the passage through laboratory animals\ncan yield better results.\n\nRESUMO\n\nDetec\u00e7\u00e3o de Leptospira spp. em s\u00eamen e urina de\ntouros sorologicamente reagentes a Leptospira\n\ninterrogans sorovar hardjo\n\nO presente trabalho avaliou a PCR na detec\u00e7\u00e3o de leptospiras\nem s\u00eamen e urina de dez touros sorologicamente reagentes,\ncomparando seus resultados com aqueles obtidos por outras\nt\u00e9cnicas de diagn\u00f3stico.
