Entre elas, a eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura superficial da \u00e1gua do mar (TSM), a eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel do mar, e a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica (AO). Os ambientes recifais t\u00eam sido apontados como os mais vulner\u00e1veis a estas mudan\u00e7as. Efeitos da eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da pC\u00dc2 sob ambientes recifais no Atl\u00e2ntico Sul, s\u00e3o escassos e na sua maioria reportam apenas efeitos da eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da TSM e eventos de branqueamento. O Atol das Rocas \u00e9 a primeira Reserva Biol\u00f3gica marinha do Brasil e foi escolhido neste estudo por ser um exemplo de recife biog\u00eanico, oce\u00e2nico e praticamente livre de impactos como sobrepesca, polui\u00e7\u00e3o, e turismo desordenado. Desta forma, o objetivo do presente estudo foi avaliar os efeitos da eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da pCO2 atmosf\u00e9rica sob os organismos construtores do atol para estabelecer um ponto de refer\u00eancia para futuras compara\u00e7\u00f5es, devido a sua vulnerabilidade a estes processos. A pesquisa foi dividida em tr\u00eas etapas, sendo essas a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do estado e a experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos prov\u00e1veis efeitos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o nos organismos calc\u00e1rios. Inicialmente s\u00e3o apresentados dados sobre a cobertura bent\u00f4nica e a sua intera\u00e7\u00e3o com os par\u00e2metros abi\u00f3ticos (temperatura, salinidade, disponibilidade de nutrientes dissolvidos, pH e alcalinidade total). Foi observada domin\u00e2ncia de macro e tufos de algas em locais com maior disponibilidade de nutrientes dissolvidos, indicando que maiores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos na \u00e1gua do mar contribuem para a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos organismos no atol. E, al\u00e9m disso, ambientes com alta frequ\u00eancia de organismos carbon\u00e1ticos foram associados com uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de alcalinidade. Em seguida, dados foram obtidos sobre reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, crescimento e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de frequ\u00eancia da popula\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie de coral dominante nas piscinas do atol (Siderastrea stellata). Foi observado um evento de planula\u00e7\u00e3o e o crescimento inicial dos p\u00f3lipos prim\u00e1rios, os quais, ap\u00f3s 3 meses mostraram uma m\u00e9dia de di\u00e2metro de 1,49\u00b10,45 mm, variando entre 0,9 e 2,28 mm e 14,70% de taxa de mortalidade. A m\u00e9dia da taxa de extens\u00e3o anual das col\u00f4nias adultas foi de 6,8 \u00b1 0,7 mm. ano-1. Col\u00f4nias com\n4,1\ta 10 cm de di\u00e2metro tamb\u00e9m foram frequentes no atol (48,1\u00b114,5%). A popula\u00e7\u00e3o de S. stellata no atol mostra-se com um alto potencial de manuten\u00e7\u00e3o e recupera\u00e7\u00e3o, embora tenha sido observado uma baixa taxa de recrutamento. Na outra etapa do estudo se fez uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema carbonato no atol, avaliando a influ\u00eancia do metabolismo dos organismos sob as varia\u00e7\u00f5es espa\u00e7o-temporais observadas. Os resultados indicaram uma grande disponibilidade de carbonato dissolvido nas piscinas do atol. Os \u00edndices de satura\u00e7\u00e3o de aragonita n\u00e3o s\u00f3 suprem as necessidades metab\u00f3licas dos organismos, como est\u00e3o acima dos observados para outros ambientes recifais. Desta forma, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que a intensa atividade biol\u00f3gica no atol das rocas possa servir como um tamp\u00e3o adicional para o equil\u00edbrio do pH e mitigar alguns dos efeitos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica localmente. Por fim, foi realizado um experimento com esp\u00e9cies que ocorrem no atol, o coral scleract\u00edneo Porites astreoides e o zoant\u00eddeo Palythoa caribaeorum. Foram avaliadas as respostas fisiol\u00f3gicas (crescimento, respira\u00e7\u00e3o, fotoss\u00edntese, lip\u00eddios totais e clorofila a) desses organismos mediante condi\u00e7\u00f5es de estresse t\u00e9rmico e acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o. P. astreoides sofreu influ\u00eancia do aquecimento e da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o em todas as taxas metab\u00f3licas avaliadas, enquanto o P. caribaeorum teve um menor, ou nenhum impacto no seu metabolismo.\nPalavras Chave: Ambientes recifais. Acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica. Aquecimento global. Atol das Rocas. Brasil\nABSTRACT\nThe increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) in the atmosphere, which rose from an average of 280 ppm before pre-industrial times to over 400 ppm today, it is one of the main responsible for a series of global changes. Among them, increasing sea surface temperature (SST), sea level rise and ocean acidification (OA). Coral reefs have been identified as the most vulnerable ecosystem to these changes. Investigations about the effects of elevated anthropogenic pCO2 on coral reef environments in the South Atlantic are scarce and mostly only effects of the increase of SST and bleaching events were reported. Rocas Atoll is the first Marine Biological Reserve in Brazil and was chosen in this study because it is an example of a oceanic biogenic reef, and virtually free from impacts such as overfishing, pollution, and unregulated tourism. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of increased atmospheric pCO2 on the atoll building organisms to establish a benchmark for future comparisons, because of their vulnerability to these processes. Initially are presented data on the benthic cover and its interaction with the abiotic parameters (temperature, salinity, availability of dissolved nutrients, pH and total alkalinity). It was observed a dominance of macro and tuff algae in places with higher availability of dissolved nutrients, indicating that higher concentrations of inorganic nutrients in seawater contribute to the spatial distribution of organisms on the atoll. And besides, environments with high frequency of carbonate organisms were associated with a decrease of alkalinity. Then, data were obtained on reproduction, growth and frequency distribution of the population of the dominant coral species in the atoll pools (Siderastrea stellata). A planulation event was observed and initial growth of primary polyps which, after 3 months showed 1.49 \u00b1 0.45 mm average diameter ranging between 0.9 and 2.28 mm and 14.70% mortality rate. The average annual extension rate of adult colonies was 6.8 \u00b1\nO.\t7 mm. year-1. Colonies with 4.1 to 10 cm diameter were also common in the atoll (48.1 \u00b1 14.5%). The population of S. stellata in the atoll shows a high potential for maintenance and recovery, although it was observed a low recruitment rate. In another stage of the study, a characterization of the carbonate system of the atoll was made, in order to assess the influence of the metabolism of organisms under spatio-temporal variations. The results indicated a large availability of dissolved carbonate in the atoll pools. The aragonite saturation rates not only supply the metabolic demands of the corals, but are above those observed for other coral reef environments. Thus, it is possible that the intense biological activity of the Rocas Atoll can serve as an additional buffer for the pH equilibrium and locally mitigate some of the effects of ocean acidification. Finally, an experiment was conducted with species that occur in the atoll, the scleractinian coral Porites astreoides and the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum. The physiological responses of these organisms were evaluated (growth, respiration, photosynthesis, total lipids and chlorophyll a) under conditions of heat stress and acidification.\nP.\tastreoides was influenced by warmer temperatures and acidification in all measured metabolic rates while P. caribaeorum showed a minor or no impact on your metabolism.\nKeywords: Brazil.

INTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O\nA concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de di\u00f3xido de carbono (CO2) na atmosfera vem sendo monitorada desde 1958 no observat\u00f3rio da Universidade da Calif\u00f3rnia San Diego (SCRIPS, UCSD) em Mauna Loa, Hava\u00ed (KEELING, 1998). Atualmente os n\u00edveis de CO2 ultrapassaram 400ppm, e a m\u00e9dia anual para 2015 (400,88ppm) bateu o recorde de mais elevada em alguns milh\u00f5es de anos. Antes da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o industrial esse valor n\u00e3o passava de 300ppm. Dentre as atividades humanas, a queima descontrolada de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis e o desflorestamento s\u00e3o os principais fatores que contribuem para essa r\u00e1pida eleva\u00e7\u00e3o (CALDEIRA; WICKETT, 2003; SABINE et al.,\n2004). Esse aumento na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2 vem causando uma s\u00e9rie de mudan\u00e7as globais, alterando o clima, causando severas e mais constantes tempestades, furac\u00f5es, enchentes, etc. Por\u00e9m, dentre essas mudan\u00e7as, tr\u00eas est\u00e3o causando grande impacto nos ecossistemas marinhos: aumento da temperatura superficial do mar (TSM), eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel do mar e acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica. De acordo com o relat\u00f3rio do Painel Intergovernamental de Mudan\u00e7as Clim\u00e1ticas (IPCC) o n\u00edvel do mar subiu +0,19m, o pH diminuiu 0,1 unidades e a m\u00e9dia de temperatura atmosf\u00e9rica global j\u00e1 aumentou 0,85\u00b0C, durante o s\u00e9culo 20 (IPCC- AR5, 2014).\nAproximadamente 90% dessa energia t\u00e9rmica tem sido acumulada nos oceanos, o que causou uma eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura superficial entre 0,09 e 0,13\u00b0C por d\u00e9cada entre o per\u00edodo de 1971 e 2010 (IPCC-AR5, 2014). Nas d\u00e9cadas de 1980 e 1990, eventos de El Ni\u00f1o foram associados com alguns dos eventos mais expressivos de estresse t\u00e9rmico em ambientes recifais. Recentemente, no entanto, tem sido testemunhado eventos de estresse t\u00e9rmico independentemente do El Ni\u00f1o, devido ao aumento das m\u00e9dias de temperatura causadas pelo aquecimento global (MUMBY; VAN WOESIK, 2014).\nTemperaturas elevadas causam impactos na simbiose cnid\u00e1rios-dinoflagelados. As microalgas simbiontes (zooxantelas) garantem reciclagem de nutrientes e fluxo de energia oriunda da atividade fotossint\u00e9tica para os organismos hospedeiros. Elas tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis pela colora\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos, e o estresse t\u00e9rmico leva a expuls\u00e3o dos simbiontes e consequentemente o branqueamento dos corais (HOEGH-GULDBERG, 1999). Anomalias de 1 a 2\u00b0C acima do m\u00e1ximo registrado durante o ver\u00e3o pode causar branqueamento de corais em massa. Da mesma forma, pequenos aumentos na TSM (0-1,5\u00b0C) durante v\u00e1rias semanas ou uma grande eleva\u00e7\u00e3o (3-4\u00b0C) durante poucos dias tamb\u00e9m causam branqueamento (HAYENNE, 2016). Elevadas temperaturas podem causar tamb\u00e9m efeitos prolongados nos\nO CO2 n\u00e3o fica concentrado apenas na atmosfera juto com outros gases respons\u00e1veis pelo efeito estufa. Assim como os oceanos absorvem a energia t\u00e9rmica, eles tamb\u00e9m absorvem o CO2 em excesso na atmosfera. Desde a revolu\u00e7\u00e3o industrial cerca de 30 a 40% do CO2 antr\u00f3pico \u00e9 absorvido pelos oceanos a cada ano (BINDOFF et al., 2007). Esse CO2 em excesso reage com a \u00e1gua do mar e por uma s\u00e9rie de rea\u00e7\u00f5es qu\u00edmicas causa um processo conhecido como acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica (AO). Esse processo tem como consequ\u00eancias redu\u00e7\u00f5es no pH, nas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es do \u00edon carbonato [COf-], e nos \u00edndices de satura\u00e7\u00e3o dos minerais carbon\u00e1ticos (Q) (DONEY et al., 2009). De acordo com HOEGH-GULDEBERG et al. (2007) os ecossistemas recifais est\u00e3o entre um dos mais amea\u00e7ados do ambiente marinho. Impactos da AO sob os organismos calcificadores s\u00e3o constantemente reportados. Processos fisiol\u00f3gicos como crescimento e calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o alguns dos mais estudados (DUPONT et al., 2010; ALBRIGHT; LANGDON, 2011; FABRICIOUS et al., 2011). Essas mudan\u00e7as na fisiologia dos indiv\u00edduos podem alterar a din\u00e2mica de suas popula\u00e7\u00f5es e por fim afetar todo o ecossistema.\nOrganismos calcificadores, mobilizam o c\u00e1lcio (Ca2+) e o carbono inorg\u00e2nico dissolvido (CID) presentes na \u00e1gua do mar para forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus esqueletos e estruturas calc\u00e1rias. A concentra\u00e7\u00e3o desses elementos na \u00e1gua do mar \u00e9 um fator crucial para o metabolismo e calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o nos recifes. O CID \u00e9 o somat\u00f3rio de todas as formas do carbono inorg\u00e2nico: o CO2 aquoso ou dissolvido, \u00e1cido carb\u00f4nico (H2CO3), bicarbonatos (HCO-) e carbonatos (COf-) (ZEEBE; WOLF-GLADROW, 2001). Em \u00e1guas marinhas predominam os \u00edons bicarbonatos (86,5%) e carbonatos (13%) e, em menor quantidade, o CO2 aquoso (0,05%) (GATTUSO et al., 1999; ZEEBE; WOLF-GLADROW, 2001). Tanto o CO2 como os carbonatos exercem uma grande influ\u00eancia na vida marinha, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 como fonte de carbono para a fotoss\u00edntese, como tamb\u00e9m para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas esquel\u00e9ticas da grande quantidade de organismos que habitam os oceanos (MAC\u00caDO et al., 2004). O ciclo do carbono num ambiente recifal \u00e9 principalmente afetado por dois processos biogeoqu\u00edmicos ilustrados na figura 1. O metabolismo do carbono org\u00e2nico atrav\u00e9s da fotoss\u00edntese e respira\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis pelas varia\u00e7\u00f5es no CID, e o metabolismo do carbono inorg\u00e2nico, com os processos de calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o e\nFigura 1 - Diagrama esquem\u00e1tico do sistema carbonato oce\u00e2nico. (Adaptado de KAYANNE, 2016)\nDiversos estudos apontam que o crescimento e a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de algumas esp\u00e9cies de organismos calc\u00e1rios e n\u00e3o calc\u00e1rios podem ser limitados pelas altera\u00e7\u00f5es qu\u00edmicas projetadas nos oceanos (ALBRIGHT et al., 2013; KROEKER et al., 2013). De todos os organismos marinhos, aqueles afetados mais intensamente s\u00e3o as esp\u00e9cies calc\u00e1rias, como moluscos, crust\u00e1ceos, equinodermas, corais, algas calc\u00e1rias, foramin\u00edferos e algumas esp\u00e9cies do pl\u00e2ncton. Essas mudan\u00e7as provocam tanto uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o da disponibilidade dos constituintes qu\u00edmicos necess\u00e1rios para a calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o de conchas e placas, como afetam sua fisiologia (KLEYPAS et al., 1999a; 2006; MUNDAY et al., 2007). De acordo com MUNBY e VAN WOESIK (2014), que revisaram uma s\u00e9rie de impactos no ecossistema recifal devido ao aquecimento e acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o, as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de corais, algas calc\u00e1rias, ouri\u00e7os e peixes recifais podem diminuir no futuro, enquanto que macroalgas e outros cnid\u00e1rios n\u00e3o calcificadores (coral mole, an\u00eamona, zoant\u00eddeos) devem se beneficiar das elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es do CID.\nPrevis\u00f5es sobre o impacto das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas s\u00e3o feitos para a grande maioria dos ambientes recifais ao redor do mundo (FREEMAN et al. 2013; NAKAMURA et al., 2013). No entanto, n\u00e3o existem modelos ecol\u00f3gicos que indiquem o futuro desse ecossistema no Brasil. A escassez de banco de dados, e falta de padroniza\u00e7\u00e3o nas metodologias contribuem para essa aus\u00eancia de modelos preditivos dos impactos das altera\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas dos oceanos sob os recifes brasileiros. Al\u00e9m disso, a maioria dos trabalhos que apresentam algum dado sobre a\ndin\u00e2mica das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de organismos recifais, foram realizados em ambientes costeiros, sujeitos a impactos locais como elevadas taxas de sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o, pesca e turismo desordenado. E assim n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel avaliar apenas o efeito causado pelos impactos do aquecimento e acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos. At\u00e9 o momento existe um trabalho publicado sobre o impacto da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o na comunidade meio-bent\u00f4nica dos recifes (SARMENTO et al., 2015) e outro sobre taxas de calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o, produtividade l\u00edquida e fluxos de CO2, ambos em recifes do sul da Bahia (LONGHINI et al., 2015).\nReconhecido pela UNESCO como um patrim\u00f4nio da humanidade e \u00fanico atol do Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico Sul, o recife biog\u00eanico de Rocas pode ser considerado um atol, pois possui uma plataforma el\u00edptica e circular, tem um anel recifal constitu\u00eddo com a predomin\u00e2ncia de algas calc\u00e1rias e moluscos vermet\u00eddeos, al\u00e9m dos corais escleract\u00ednios (KIKUCHI; LE\u00c3O, 1997; ECHEVERRIA et al., 1997). Transformado em uma unidade de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da categoria Reserva Biol\u00f3gica (REBIO) em 1979, cujo objetivo \u00e9 proteger integralmente o Atol e \u00e1guas circundantes de at\u00e9 1.000 metros de profundidade, a REBIO n\u00e3o \u00e9 aberta ao p\u00fablico, sendo permitido apenas o monitoramento ambiental, o patrulhamento e estudos cient\u00edficos.\nDesta forma, o recife biog\u00eanico do Atol das Rocas foi escolhido como laborat\u00f3rio natural, devido ao seu estado de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e isolamento de demais impactos antropog\u00eanicos, para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das condi\u00e7\u00f5es atuais de seus organismos construtores, caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema carbonato e a intera\u00e7\u00e3o dos organismos com os par\u00e2metros f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos. Atrav\u00e9s destes dados, e de experimentos realizados com esp\u00e9cies de corais e zoant\u00eddeos que ocorrem no Atol das Rocas, foi poss\u00edvel analisar a susceptibilidade dos organismos aos efeitos causados pela eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do CO2 na atmosfera.\n2.\tJUSTIFICATIVA\nA biodiversidade dos ambientes recifais \u00e9 uma das mais distintas e complexas entre os diferentes ecossistemas marinhos. Eles fornecem in\u00fameros benef\u00edcios, incluindo alimentos, prote\u00e7\u00e3o costeira, regula\u00e7\u00e3o clim\u00e1tica, al\u00e9m de darem suporte e abrigo a uma variedade de comunidades marinhas de interesse econ\u00f4mico, como peixes, moluscos e crust\u00e1ceos (MOBERG e FOLKE, 1999; OHMAN e CESAR, 2000). Os ambientes recifais t\u00eam sido apontados como os mais vulner\u00e1veis a eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura superficial (TSM) da \u00e1gua do\nO Atol das Rocas foi escolhido neste estudo por ser um exemplo de recife biog\u00eanico, oce\u00e2nico e praticamente livre de impactos como sobre pesca, polui\u00e7\u00e3o, e turismo desordenado. Alguns estudos sobre cnid\u00e1rios foram realizados no atol e abordaram temas como distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies (LABOREL, 1970; SCHLENZ; BEL\u00c9M, 1992; ECHEVERRIA et al., 1997), monitoramento da sa\u00fade recifal (FERREIRA; MAIDA, 2006) e branqueamento (MAYAL et al., 2009 FERREIRA et al., 2012). Enquanto v\u00e1rios registros detalhados de par\u00e2metros f\u00edsicos e qu\u00edmicos t\u00eam sido coletados em amplas escalas espa\u00e7o-temporais durante as \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas em \u00e1reas oce\u00e2nicas (FLORES MONTES et al., 2009; MAC\u00caDO et al., 2009; MEDEIROS et al., 2009), h\u00e1 uma escassez de dados sobre como os par\u00e2metros do sistema carbonato variam naturalmente em escalas espa\u00e7o-temporais biologicamente relevantes em sistemas recifais.\nDesta forma, a aus\u00eancia de informa\u00e7\u00f5es, falta de conhecimento da influ\u00eancia da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o na forma\u00e7\u00e3o recifal e a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos organismos que contribuem ativamente para o crescimento do recife biog\u00eanico do Atol das Rocas s\u00e3o as motiva\u00e7\u00f5es principais para a elabora\u00e7\u00e3o desta pesquisa. Uma vez que o atol apresenta uma alta biodiversidade, e grande relev\u00e2ncia para conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e perpetua\u00e7\u00e3o de muitas esp\u00e9cies, sendo uma importante \u00e1rea de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, dispers\u00e3o, alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e abrigo para diversos animais. Al\u00e9m disso, apresenta grande import\u00e2ncia estrat\u00e9gica e econ\u00f4mica devido a expans\u00e3o da zona econ\u00f4mica exclusiva brasileira.\n3.\tOBJETIVOS\n3.1.\tObjetivo geral\nAvaliar o estado de vulnerabilidade dos organismos construtores do Atol das Rocas diante de um cen\u00e1rio dos efeitos diretos e indiretos do aumento global de CO2 atmosf\u00e9rico.\n3.2.\tObjetivos espec\u00edficos\n\u2022\tCaracterizar os par\u00e2metros f\u00edsicos e qu\u00edmicos em piscinas abertas e fechadas do atol;\n\u2022\tCaracterizar a cobertura bent\u00f4nica em algumas das principais piscinas do atol;\n\u2022\tAvaliar a intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre os par\u00e2metros abi\u00f3ticos e a cobertura bent\u00f4nica;\n\u2022\tObter dados de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, crescimento e frequ\u00eancia de tamanho da popula\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie de coral dominante (5. stellata} nas piscinas do atol;\n\u2022\tInvestigar poss\u00edveis impactos das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas e acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica sob a din\u00e2mica populacional dessa esp\u00e9cie;\n\u2022\tDeterminar varia\u00e7\u00f5es espa\u00e7o-temporais no sistema carbonato marinho do atol;\n\u2022\tAvaliar a intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre os organismos e o sistema carbonato;\n\u2022\tObter taxas de crescimento, fotoss\u00edntese, respira\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00edveis de lip\u00eddio e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de clorofilaa de esp\u00e9cies de cnid\u00e1rios que ocorrem no Atol das Rocas quando submetidos a condi\u00e7\u00f5es de eleva\u00e7\u00e3o de temperatura e n\u00edveis de pCO2\n\u2022 Investigar a susceptibilidade do Atol das Rocas mediante \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as biogeoqu\u00edmicas dos oceanos.\n4.\tHIP\u00d3TESE\nO aumento das emiss\u00f5es de di\u00f3xido de carbono influencia na sa\u00fade ambiental do Atol das Rocas.\n5.\t\u00c1REA DE ESTUDO\nA Reserva Biol\u00f3gica do Atol das Rocas situa-se em um monte submarino pertencente \u00e0 Cadeia de Montanhas Fernando de Noronha, que \u00e9 de origem vulc\u00e2nica e caracteriza-se por um conjunto de altos montes submarinos que se elevam acima do sop\u00e9 continental, entre 2\u00b0 S e 4\u00b0 30' S, e estende-se da base do talude continental at\u00e9 a altura de 31\u00b0 O (Fig. 2). O monte submarino do extremo leste emerge acima do n\u00edvel do mar e forma o arquip\u00e9lago de Fernando de Noronha. Os outros montes, alinhados na dire\u00e7\u00e3o L - O at\u00e9 a costa brasileira (Cear\u00e1), ascendem at\u00e9 profundidades inferiores a 250 metros, sendo que alguns quase alcan\u00e7am a superf\u00edcie, como \u00e9 o caso do Atol das Rocas (DAMUTH; PALMA, 1979).\nO Atol das Rocas est\u00e1 situado em \u00e1guas jurisdicionais brasileiras, a 144 milhas n\u00e1uticas (267 km) a Leste-Nordeste da cidade de Natal, Estado do Rio Grande do Norte, e a 80 milhas n\u00e1uticas (148 km) a oeste do Arquip\u00e9lago de Fernando de Noronha, Estado de Pernambuco, na \u00e1rea definida pelas coordenadas 03\u00b045' e 03\u00b056' latitude sul e 33 37' e 33 56' longitude oeste.

Aspects of the life history of a coral population, such as reproduction, growth and size-frequency can contribute to the production of models that are used to estimate impacts and potential recovery of the population, acting as a powerful tool for the conservation and management of those ecosystems. Here, we present the first evidence of Siderastrea stellata planulation, its early growth, population size-frequency distribution and growth rate of adult colonies in Rocas Atoll. Our results, together with the environmental protection policies and the absence of anthropogenic pressures, suggest that S. stellata population may have a good potential in the maintenance and recovery in the atoll. However, our results also indicate an impact on corals' recruitment, probably as a consequence of the positive temperature anomaly that occurred in 2010. Thus, despite the pristine status of Rocas Atoll, the preservation of its coral community seems to be threatened by current global changes, such as more frequent thermal stress events.\n6.1.2.\tResumo\nOs recifes de coral s\u00e3o um dos ecossistemas mais vulner\u00e1veis ao aquecimento e acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos, e \u00e9 importante compreender o papel das esp\u00e9cies construtores de recifes neste ambiente, a fim de se obter uma vis\u00e3o sobre a sua susceptibilidade aos impactos das mudan\u00e7as globais esperados.

No entanto, nossos resultados tamb\u00e9m indicam um impacto sobre o recrutamento dos corais, provavelmente em decorr\u00eancia da\nanomalia de temperatura positiva que ocorreu em 2010. Assim, apesar do estado de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do Atol das Rocas, a preserva\u00e7\u00e3o de sua comunidade coral\u00ednea parece estar amea\u00e7ada pelas atuais mudan\u00e7as globais, como eventos de estresse t\u00e9rmico mais frequentes.\n6.1.3.\tINTRODUCTION\nIncreasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere has been changing physical and chemical aspects of the planet, causing global warming, sea level rise, more frequent and intense storms, and ocean acidification (SABINE et al. 2004; ANTHONY et al. 2011; ZEEBE,\n2012). Coral reefs are directly impacted by those changes; a rise in sea surface temperature causes severe bleaching (HOEGH-GULDBERG, 2011), ocean acidification suppresses growth and calcification (ALBRIGHT et al., 2016) and sea level rise causes submergence of coral reefs and atoll islands (KAYANNE, 2016). Consequently, they are the one of the most threatened ecosystems (KLEYPAS et al. 1999 a, b; KROEKER et al., 2013) and it is important to estimate their recovery potential from natural physiological disturbances and from anthropogenic perturbation. According to EDMUNDS (2007) aspects of the life history of a coral population, such as reproduction, or growth and size- frequency are crucial to understand their role in the marine ecosystem and to obtain insight into their susceptibility to changes in the external physical and chemical environment. This information can be used in coral models and function as excellent tools to study demography, physiology/growth, and ecology, helping the conservation and management of this important ecosystem (PINIAK et al., 2006).\nIn the South Atlantic Ocean there is only one atoll, Rocas Atoll, the first Brazilian marine protected area, created in 1979 and considered a pristine reef ecosystem (LONGO et al., 2015). Due to its isolation and conservational status, Rocas Atoll can act as an excellent opportunity to study the mechanism and impacts of global changes on reef systems. However, there is a gap of knowledge about corals population dynamics in this area. Its reef structure is constructed mainly by encrusting coralline red algae (70%) with the secondary framework builders composed by vermetid gastropods, encrusting foraminifera, polychaetes worm tubes, and corals (less than 10%) (KIKUCHI; LE\u00c3O, 1997; GHERARDI; BOSENCE, 2001). The dominant reef building coral species is Siderastrea stellata Verrill, 1868 occurring in all tidal pools of the atoll (ECHEVERRIA et al., 1997). New information about its early growth, size frequency\ndistribution and growth rate of adult colonies will contribute to model this population and predict effects of possible impacts such as ocean acidification or global warming.\nS. stellata belongs to the genus Siderastrea de Blainville, 1830 and to the family Siderastreidae Vaughan and Wells, 1943. According to WELLS (1956), this genus has existed since the Cretaceous and is represented by five extant species which has spread mainly in the Atlantic ocean, although two of them (Siderastrea savignyana and Siderastrea glynni) can be found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans (BUDD; GUZMAN, 1994). S. stellata together with the species from the Caribbean Sea (Siderastrea siderea and Siderastrea radians) compose the \u201cAtlantic Siderastrea complex\u201d (VERON, 1995). The taxonomy of this group has been debated and previously S. stellata was considered the only siderastreid in Brazil (LABOREL 1974, MAIDA; FERREIRA, 1997). Recently, the presence of S. radians and S. siderea was confirmed on the Brazilian coast (NEVES et al., 2008, 2010, NUNES et al., 2011), however, neither of those investigations included specimens collected at Rocas Atoll and up to now, only the occurrence of S. stellata is confirmed in this atoll.\nS. stellata is a colonial, zooxanthellated and massive coral species with high resistance to environmental stress, such as sedimentation, wave action, temperature and salinity variations (LE\u00c3O et al. 2003). Until recently, it was accepted that its spatial distribution in the South Atlantic was from Parcel do Manuel Luiz, Maranh\u00e3o (00\u00b053\u2019S, 044\u00b016\u2019W) to Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro - (23\u00b0S, 042\u00b0W, Lins-de-Barros and Pires, 2007), but CORDEIRO et al. (2015) shows that this species can also be found in reef communities adjacent to the Amazon River Month in the coast of the Para state (00\u00b021'14\"S 46\u00b053'56\"W). According to LINS DE BARROS et al. (2003) S. stellata is a gonochoric brooder species, with a high female to male sex ratio and an annual reproductive cycle. Planulation occurs preferably during the austral summer, concomitant with the seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) rise. S. stellata planula larvae were also observed in laboratory experiments to be released in January and April. The larvae contain zooxanthellae, with varied size from 500 pm to 1.4 mm in diameter and they start settlement between 72 hours to 15 days in close contact with parental polyps (NEVES; SILVEIRA, 2003).\nLINS DE BARROS and PIRES (2006 a, b, 2007) studied some aspects of the life history of this species such as reproduction, growth and size frequency for other sites on the coast of Brazil. Nevertheless, at Rocas Atoll, despite the existence of information on S. stellata\nabundance (ECHEVERRIA et al., 1997; FONSECA et al., 2012), percent coverage (LONGO et al., 2015), and its importance as a natural archive for paleoclimate studies (MAYAL et al., 2009; OLIVEIRA, 2012; PEREIRA et al., 2016), there is no record of other aspects of its population dynamics. Part of the reason of the absence of population models for Brazilian coral species are due to this lack of information to produce them. In this study we present the first evidence of S. stellata planulation, its early growth, size frequency distribution and growth rate of adult colonies. In addition, we discuss the implications of our results under a scenario of predicted impacts due to warming and acidification for the conservation of S. stellata population at Rocas Atoll.\n6.1.4.\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy site\nThe Rocas Atoll is situated 266 km northeast of the coastal city of Natal, northeastern\nBrazil (Fig. 12). It is one of the smallest atolls in the world, with an axis of 3.35 km by 2.49 km, a reef area of 6.56 km2 and a perimeter of 11 km (PEREIRA et al., 2010) and is the only atoll located in the western part of the South Atlantic (3\u00b051'S, 33\u00b049'W).\nFigure 12- Location of the Rocas Atoll and the geographical distribution of the species S. stellata in the South America (orange area). The geomorphological map of the Rocas Atoll shows the intertidal reef- flat pools where colonies of S. stellata were collected and investigated - Abrolhos (AB), \u00c2ncoras (AC), Cemit\u00e9rio (CM), Cemit\u00e9riozinho (CZ), Falsa Barreta (FB), Mapas (MP), Porites (PO), Podes Crer (PC), Tartarugas (TA) and Sal\u00e3o (SL)\nRocas is dominated by the South Equatorial Current (SEC), with consistent westerly flow (GOES, 2005) and a mean velocity of 30 cm per second in the 4\u00b0S parallel (RICHARDSON; WALSH, 1986). The tidal regime is semi-diurnal and meso-tidal (GHERARDI; BOSENCE, 2001). No tidal range records exist in Rocas Atoll. In Fernando de Noronha's harbor (144 km east from Rocas) the maximum tidal range is 2.8 m (DHN, 2014). The equatorial location of the Rocas Atoll leads to minimal seasonal SST variability, with an annual range of 3\u00b0C for monthly mean temperatures (FERREIRA et al., 2012). Salinity in the surrounding sea waters varies from 36 to 37 (GHERARDI; BOSENCE, 1999). There is a wet season from approximately March through July and a dry season from approximately August through February (APAC, 2016).\nDetermination of early growth of S. stellata primary polyps\nFive colonies of S. stellata (diameters between 10 and 20 cm) were collected during the last week of December 2012 at Cemit\u00e9rio pool and kept in 30 L seawater tanks with circulation and air pumps, covered with preconditioned ceramic tiles. The tanks were kept at the scientific base at Rocas Atoll in a shade dock that allows natural luminosity, but protects from direct solar incidence. Seawater in the tanks was renewed daily and temperature and salinity subsequently determined. During this process, the presence of planula larvae in the water column and the settlement of the primary polyps on the tiles was checked. From January until March 2013 the growth of the recruit was evaluated. The ceramic tiles were analyzed using a stereomicroscope and photographed. The size of the recruits was determined by measuring the maximum diameter at the base of the living tissue and the total area of the primary polyp using the Image J software. Polyp mortality was identified by the absence of living tissue on the skeleton, or when recruits were covered by epibenthic algae. At the end of the expedition in March 2013, the ceramic tiles and coral colonies were fixed back on the pool.\nGrowth rate of adult colonies\nThe growth rate pattern for S. stellata was analyzed in seven colonies of this species collected during June of 2012 from the following tidal pools: Abrolhos (1), Cemit\u00e9rio (1), Cemit\u00e9riozinho (1), Falsa Barreta (1), Mapas (1), and Tartarugas (2). Colonies were cut into halves, and one half was cut into 5-mm thick slices parallel to the vertical growth axis of the whole colony. After cutting, these slices were air-dried and X-ray images were taken and digitalized for analysis of the extension rate by using the CoralXDS 3.0 Software (HELMLE et\nal., 2002). Afterwards, several transects were analyzed in the digital image of the coral X-radiography in order to totally cover the lateral extension of the coral slab (Fig. 13).\nFigure 13 - a) Radiography of a 5 mm-slabs of one S. stellata colony collected at the Rocas Atoll showing the transect locations along the growth axis and through the lateral extension of the colony slab where CoralXDS analysis were carried out; (b) image of the 5 mm-slab of the same colony.\nS. stellata population size structure\nDuring January and May 2014, the S. Stellata population data were collected by scuba divers along eight belt transects in each tidal pool. All S. stellata colonies within a 1 m belt transect, along 20-m transect, were counted and their size were categorized in four different classes according their maximum diameter size: &lt;2 cm, 2.1 - 4.0 cm, 4.1 - 10 cm and above 10 cm. Colonies in the transect edge were only considered in the count if they were more than 50% inside the delimited belt transect area.\n6.1.5.\tRESULTS\nEarly growth of S. stellata primary polyps\nDuring the period of the experiment (late December 2012 to early March 2013), the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) temperature and salinity in the tanks with the colonies and ceramic tiles were 29.01\u00b12.03 \u00b0C and 35.24\u00b10.8 ppt, respectively. Five to seven days after the sampling period of the colonies, planula larvae was observed searching for suitable places in the ceramic tiles to settle (Fig 14b, c). In total, 34 S. stellata recruits were observed. Five of them died during the study, corresponding to a mortality rate of 14.70%. Fusion of three primary polyps\nwas observed (Fig 14f), therefore those records were not used in the calculation of the growth rate due to the difficulty in identifying the base of the recruits. In addition, six other recruits were excluded from the evaluation due to the fact that their tentacles were always extended and the base of the polyps was partially covered by algae. From the 34 recruits observed, only 20 had their growth evaluated during the entire experimental period. In January (about 17 days old), the mean diameter of the recruits (\u00b1 SD) was 1.15\u00b10.33 mm, ranging from 0.56 to 1.90 mm. In February (about one month), the recruits had a mean diameter of 1.25\u00b1 0.36, ranging from 0.71 to 2.12 mm. In March (aging around 45 to 50 days old), the recruits had mean values of diameters of 1.49\u00b10.45 mm, ranging from 0.9 to 2.28 mm (Fig 15.a)\nThe mean area of the recruits (\u00b1 SD) was 1.32\u00b10.73 mm2 in January, ranging from 0.32 to 3.28 mm2. In\nFebruary, the recruits presented a mean area of 1.61\u00b1 0.94 mm2, with a minimum of 0.51 and maximum of 4.38 mm2. Average area of the recruits measured in March was 2.23\u00b11.26 mm2 ranging from 0.78 to 4.7 mm2 (Fig 15.b).\nFigure 64 - Parental colonies (a), planula larvae (b, c) and recruits nearly 50 days old (d, e, f) of S. stellata from Rocas Atoll.\nFigure 75- Size of the S. stellata recruits according to a- diameter and b- area, measured between January and March 2013 at Rocas Atoll.\nMonth\nJanuary\n\u25a0 February\nMarch\nGrowth rate of adult colonies\nTable I presents the annual extension rate of the seven colonies of S. stellata studied, obtained from the analysis of their radiographies using CoralXDS.

The lowest abundance was recorded at Porites and Cemit\u00e9rio, with 0.645 and 0.465 colonies m-2, respectively (Fig 16. a). The frequency of the smallest size classes (recruits: diameters up to 2 cm and young colonies: 2.1 to 4 cm) were the lowest, representing less than 20% in all pools. Podes Crer was the pool were we observed more recruits: 26 in an eight belt transect (20 m2 each) survey. The most frequent size class consisted of diameters between 4.01 and 10 cm. This was the dominant size frequency at Porites and \u00c2ncoras with 67.4 and 62.3%, respectively, at Cemit\u00e9rio and Podes Crer the size class 4.0110cm was as frequent as the largest size class (>10cm). Half of the colonies observed at Tartarugas had a diameter higher than 10 cm. This class size was the dominant one at the Sal\u00e3o pool, with 68.9% of the colonies belonging to this size class (> 10 cm) (Fig. 15. b)\nFigure 86 - S. stellata colony size- frequency distribution at the pools of Rocas Atoll (a) and abundance (m2) (b).\n6.1.6.\tDISCUSSION\nThe results presented here begin to fill a gap in the knowledge about the dynamics of the dominant coral species at Rocas Atoll, and will contribute to the construction of models that would provide assistance for conservation and management of this population, and insight into their vulnerability to global change impacts. This study showed for the first time a Siderastrea stellata reproduction event at Rocas Atoll, with planula larvae being observed during the first week of January. According to LINS DE BARROS et al. (2003), it was observed latitudinal differences in the S. stellata period of planulation, e.g. December- early January in Buzios, and February to mid-March in Abrolhos-BA, and this difference was attributed to a punctual upwelling phenomenon that occurs in Buzios-RJ, which lowers the SST by many degrees. Planulation as consequence of the stress and handling during collection was detected by NEVES and SILVEIRA (2003), where they inferred immaturity due to a high mortality rate of extruded larvae within 24-48 h of a free-swimming existence.\nOur colonies were handled carefully and kept in tanks, within less than 1 km of distance from the sampling pool, with natural light and daily water change. During our experiment, larval swimming behavior or mortality was not observed. Out of all the recruits obtained in the experiment, only 14.70% died by the end of the third month. In the LINS DE BARROS and PIRES (2007) study on the reproduction of S. stellata in Fernando de Noronha, they observed in colonies collected in late January that even though the planulation season had already started, oocytes were present in all of the examined polyps. They also observed that there was high polyp fecundity versus low number of larvae (37%), which suggested that most of the oocytes produced had not been fertilized. Therefore, although we have had observed larvae release, metamorphose and settlement of the S. stellata at Rocas Atoll, further studies are necessary to clarify the reproductive peak period of this specie and fertilization rate of its population.\nJuvenile life stages play critical roles in the population dynamics of virtually all organisms, and therefore precise estimates of juvenile growth and survival are important for accurate demographic analyses (EDMUNDS, 2007). In our study the mean diameter of the recruits as measured in March (aging around 45 to 50 days old) was 1.49\u00b10.45 mm, ranging from 0.9 to 2.28 mm. According to PINHEIRO (2006), which monitored the growth of S. stellata recruits at the no take zone from the Coral's Coast Marine Protected Area (Tamandare, PE) during one year, recruits with about the same age (50 days old) had an average diameter of 2.11\u00b1 0.69 mm\n(n= 16), and by the end of the monitoring year they measured 7.19\u00b1 4.5 mm, with a maximum observed diameter of 12.7 mm. Those recruits were kept on the natural reef, providing more stability and nutrients for the corals to grow. Although caution was taken to maintain good conditions in the tanks (water flow, oxygenation, and daily seawater change), it is likely that our results could reflect this experimental condition. CASTRO (2008) observed S. stellata recruits with 1.5 years and diameters of 2.9 and 3.35 mm and juvenile corals with 7.29 mm (2.16 years) and 6.41mm (2.66 years) in a study in the south of Bahia state (Eastern Brazil), but it is not clear if those results represent recruits kept in an aquarium setup or on a natural reef. Either way, those diameter sizes and growth are very small compared to a rough estimation done with linear regression of the results observed during the three months of this study, which indicate a diameter range of 4.46 to 7.78 mm for one-year age recruits.\nSome variations in growth rates of coral recruit have been attributed to different intensities of competition caused by the growth of algae and other organisms (HARRISON; WALLACE, 1990; VERMEIJ, 2006), differences at the family taxonomic level, related to the spawning modes (BABCOCK, 1985), and changes in the microhabitats conditions such as luminosity differences (ANTHONY; HOEGH-GULDBERG, 2003). Even though it is common to observe variations in the growth rates, it is important to have precise estimates. Discrepancies have important implications, because it suggests that the recruitment dynamics of coral populations may function over time scales longer than those usually considered (EDMUNDS,\n2007). This study is the first to show the initial growth of S. stellata recruits in Rocas Atoll, although longer studies are needed to draw conclusions about the earlier growth rates of this species.\nConcerning the annual extension rate for adult colonies, a growth rate of 6.8 \u00b10.7 mm. yr-1 (min. 5.1 and max.11.7 mm.y-1) was observed. This is in accordance with the study by OLIVEIRA (2012) who applyied a combined technic of radiometric U/Th dating and density banding counting to find a growth rate of 6.01\u00b11.08 mm.yr-1, ranging from 3.76 to 8.53 mm. yr-1 for S. stellata from Rocas Atoll.\nIn reefs off the coast of Bahia state, linear extension rates of 2.73 \u00b1035 mm yr-1 were found by LINS DE BARROS and PIRES (2006b), which measured in colonies stained with alizarin red S, following the method of LAMBERT (1978). Additionally, REIS and LE\u00c3O (2000) reported a linear growth rate of 2.38\u00b10.20 mm yr-1 by counting the density banding\nrevealed in X-radiographies. Although the methodology used by LINS DE BARROS and PIRES (2006b) could cause handling stress during coral staining, and thus lead to a lower growth rate, the results presented by REIS and LE\u00c3O (2000) pointed to the same value, indicating that the observed growth rate might be site dependent.\nDifferences in the mean annual linear extension were also observed for Siderastrea siderea, in Panama. There, GUZMAN and TUDHOPE (1998) observed a 7.6 \u00b1 0.7 mm mean annual linear extension during the period from April 1991 to March 1992. In a previous study, GUZMAN and CORTES (1989), reported a decadal mean annual linear extension of 5.2 mm (ranging from 2 to 6.3 mm; 1976 to 1986), about 2.4 mm lower than the rate recorded in the 90\u2019s. Variations of the annual extension rate were also observed for S. siderea in the Caribbean Sea, from 3.5 to 4.3 mm. yr-1 in Puerto Rico (TORRES; MORELOCK, 2002).\nThe lower linear growth rates observed for S. stellata at the reefs from Bahia coast compared to Rocas Atoll (this study and OLIVEIRA, 2012), may be due to the differences in the environmental conditions from the two localities. Although, there is an agreement in the scientific community that coral extension rates are species specific (MUSLIC et al., 2013), studies measuring linear extension rates within individual species indicated that a variety of factors such as season, rainfall, the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, light levels and location within the reef, correlate with (and may influence) coral linear extension rates (ANTHONY; HOEGH-GULDBERG, 2003; DE\u2019ATH et al., 2009). There are important differences between Rocas Atoll and reefs from the south of Bahia, especially regarding aspects such as sedimentation rates. Rocas is an oceanic island, isolated from the influence of river discharges and it is probably the most effective marine reserve and the closest to a pristine reef in the Tropical Southwestern Atlantic (LONGO et al., 2015). Reefs from the Coast of Bahia are experiencing increasing degradation due to a combination of large-scale natural threats (e.g. sea level oscillations and ENSO events). Local scale anthropogenic stressors, such as accelerated coastal development, reef eutrophication, marine pollution, tourism pressure, over-exploitation of reef resources, overfishing and destructive fisheries and, more recently, the introduction of non-indigenous invasive species are also related to this degradation (LE\u00c3O; KIKUCHI, 2011). There is a record of the impact of ENSO events in the coral community at the atoll (FERREIRA et al., 2012) but overall, the differences in the linear extension rates for S. stellata we observed in this study may reflect the higher environmental quality of the reef system in Rocas compared to those from Bahia.\nSize-frequency distributions have been used to assess the ecological status of different populations in a variety of ecosystems. In coral reef systems, size reflects many life-history processes such as maturation, fecundity, survival and the response of corals to time-varying influences of the environment, including the intensity and frequency of disturbances and the degree of environmental degradation (ZVULONI et al. 2008).\nAs a dominant coral specie at Rocas, the abundance of S. stellata we found in this study (Fig. 16) is in accordance with the hard coral coverage evaluated by FERREIRA et al. (2012). They reported a higher percentage in the open pools compared to the isolated ones: 50.6 \u00b16.0 % at Sal\u00e3o; 34.0 \u00b114.2% at Podes Crer; followed by 22.5 \u00b17.8% in Tartarugas and the lowest coverage, 5.6 \u00b16.1% at Cemit\u00e9rio. Besides great abundance, the open pools have a high frequency of larger colonies. In the Sal\u00e3o pool, for instance, 68.87% of the colonies have diameters greater than 10 cm. Coral colony size might be considered important for maturation and fecundity. According to LINS DE BARROS and PIRES (2006a), the number of oocytes produced per polyp in S. stellata populations is highly variable, although it was always greater in larger colonies, averaging eight oocytes per polyp, and nonetheless colonies larger than 5 cm in diameter had at least one oocyte. Thereby, the size frequency distribution of S. stellata population at Rocas Atoll presented here can be considered to be representative of a mature community, with overall high frequency of colonies with diameters higher than 10 cm (41.2\u00b1 18.5%).\nAnother factor that may contribute to the potential of maintenance and recovery of S. stellata population in the atoll is the tidal dynamics that results in strong currents when the atoll is either filling or draining and during high tides (LONGO et al., 2015). S. stellata larvae started to settle between 72 hours and 15 days in close contact with parental polyps (NEVES; SILVEIRA, 2003), and even though it is still necessary to elucidate dispersion and larval recruitment in the atoll, it is likely that the larvae produced by the colonies in the open pools can be dispersed around the atoll. This would explain the higher frequency of juvenile colonies in the closed pools, where we observed frequencies of 67.4% at Porites and 62.3% at \u00c2ncoras in colonies with 4.1 to 10 cm diameters. FERREIRA et al. (2012) indicate that the occurrence of two sequential positive SST anomalies (2009 and 2010), which triggered up to 50 % coral bleaching in the Rocas Atoll and Fernando de Noronha reefs, reduced post-bleaching coral recovery and intensified the outbreak of diseases, specifically black-band, plague and dark-spot diseases affecting primarily Siderastrea spp. at the atoll. Thus, the low frequency of young\ncolonies with diameters up to 2 cm (1.8\u00b11.12%) and from 2.1 to 4 cm (8.9\u00b13.87%) that we found in our study may be a consequence of a reduced recruitment event.\nSeveral authors have investigated negative effects of increasing SST on coral reefs. EDMUNDS (2007) highlights a gradual decline in the growth rates of juvenile corals in St. John, US Virgin Islands and links this decline with rising seawater temperature and depressed aragonite saturation state. The author further suggests that the effects of global climate change may have already reduced the growth of juvenile corals. DE'ATH et al. (2009) show that linear extension rates in corals decrease as a result of SST increase. ANLAUF et al. (2011) points out that in future scenarios of increased temperature and oceanic acidification, coral planulae will be able to disperse and settle successfully, but primary polyp growth may be hampered. According to ALBRIGHT (2011), available information indicates that ocean acidification (enhanced by warming) may negatively affect sperm motility and fertilization success, larval metabolism, larval settlement, and post settlement growth and calcification.\nOur results suggest that the population of S. stellata at Rocas Atoll has a high potential of maintenance and recovery, especially because the atoll is one of the most effective marine protected areas in the South Atlantic, and an oceanic island. Rocas is practically free of anthropogenic impacts such as declining water quality, over-exploitation of key marine species, destructive fishing and pollution but still, its location and local police cannot protect it from global- scale risks making it highly vulnerable to warming and acidification of the oceans waters.\n6.2.\tInteractions between Hydrology and Benthic Coverage at Rocas Atoll\n6.2.1.\tAbstract\nAbiotic parameters and benthic coverage were determined in shallow habitats at Rocas Atoll. It was found daily and seasonal variations on seawater characteristics related to tides, pluviometry, daily solar cycle, and organisms\u2019 metabolism. Habitats with high coverage of carbonatic organisms were associated with the alkalinity of seawater, whereas habitats with elevated abundance of turf and macro algae were correlated to dissolved inorganic nutrients. Therefore, it is suggested that the availability of nutrients and carbonates in seawater are important for the organism\u2019s distribution in the atoll. Only seven corals settled on the plates during the experiment (Porites spp. and Siderastrea spp.). In order to better constrain the causes of the low coral recruitment in the atoll and predicted the effects of climate changes and ocean acidification over this important reef ecosystem, it is necessary to assess, in high resolution (i.e. week to monthly), the environmental variables that overlaps a short-term period.\n6.2.2.\tResumo\nPar\u00e2metros abi\u00f3ticos e a cobertura bent\u00f4nica foram determinados em habitats rasos no Atol das Rocas.

Its reef framework is\nwell described by KIKUCHI and LE\u00c3O (1997) and GHERARDI and BOSENCE (1999, 2001). One of Roca's characteristics that distinguishes it from other atolls concerns its composition. Encrusting coralline red algae, shells of vermetid gastropods, encrusting foraminifera and polychaetes worm tubes are the main carbonatic organisms responsible for the structure of Rocas Atoll. This is in contrast to the structure of atolls from the Indo-pacific and Caribbean waters, which are mainly constructed by hermatypic corals (KIKUCHI and LE\u00c3O, 1997; GHERARDI and BOSENCE, 2001).\nFONSECA et al. (2012) studyied reef flat community structure at Rocas, and found a great scarcity of hermatypic corals species and cover, stating that the reef flat is near solely dominated by turf forming and crustose macroalgae species. According to these authors, local, small-scale variability of physical and biotic factors in a well-defined reef geomorphic zone may harbor microcosms, each supporting unique benthic communities. In fact, LONGO et al. (2015) observed variations in benthic and reef fish communities, and feeding pressure on the benthos between open and closed pools at the atoll. They suggest that the dynamic in open pools is mostly driven by physical factors and the tolerance of organisms to harsh conditions, while in closed pools direct and indirect effects of species interaction play an important role.\nThe increasing demand for progress, since the industrial revolution, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has raised from 280 ppm to over 400 ppm in the present days (ALBRIGHT et al., 2016). This elevation is mainly caused by the fossil fuel burn and deforestation and has been causing a series of problems to the Earth equilibrium, such as climate changes, sea level rise and most recently a process known as ocean acidification (OA) (ANTHONY et al., 2011; ZEEBE, 2012). OA can be summarized as the process by which the rising atmospheric CO2 is absorbed by the ocean surface waters, increases the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), leading to a number of chemical changes including increased hydrogen ion concentrations (lower pH, more acidic) and reduced carbonate ion concentrations. (IGLESIAS-RODRIGUEZ et al., 2016).\nImpacts of OA on marine calcifiers (organisms that depend on carbonate ions available on the seawater to build their skeletons, shells, etc.) are constantly been reported around the world, affecting physiological processes such as calcification, photosynthesis, and neurophysiological pathways. (DUPONT et al., 2010; ALBRIGHT and LANGDON, 2011; FABRICIUS et al., 2011; MELZNER et al., 2011). According to HOEGH-GULDBERG et al. (2007), reef\necosystems are among one of the most threatened environments. Nevertheless, OA can cause positive effects in other marine organisms, especially algae and seagrass, which use the CO2 in excess on the water to increase their photosynthetic activities elevating their primary production and growth (KROEKER et al., 2013). Those changes in the physiology of individuals can alter the dynamics of their populations and ultimately affect entire ecosystems (IGLESIAS-RODRIGUEZ et al., 2016).\nAs an isolated, near-pristine system, where natural mechanisms can still be studied under limited human impact, the comprehension of processes influencing biological communities and how they promote ecosystem functions is particularly important to Rocas Atoll (LONGO et al., 2015). In this context, the goal of this study was to improve the understanding of physical-biological interactions at benthic communities in Rocas Atoll. Therefore providing data to support future investigations of the climate change and OA impacts at one of the most effective marine protected area in Brazil.\n6.2.4.\tSTUDY AREA\nRocas Atoll is situated at latitude 3\u00b051\u2019S and longitude 33\u00b0 49\u2019W, 266 km from the city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, and 145 km from Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil (Fig. 17). Rocas is the only atoll formation in the South Atlantic and is placed on the Fernando de Noronha Seamount Chain (KIKUCHI; LE\u00c3O, 1997). With an axis of 3.35 km by 2.49 km, a reef area of 6.56 km2 and a perimeter of 11 km, Rocas is one of the smallest atolls in the world (PEREIRA et al., 2010).\nAccording to VILLAS-BOAS et al. (2005), the variation in shape and growth of framework building coralline algae and their role in reef structure is directly related to hydrodynamic energy. The reef rim perimeter can be as wide as 600m, and presents a number of intertidal pools, from narrow fissures to large pools with sandy bottoms (KIKUCHI and LE\u00c3O, 1997; GHERARDI and BOSENCE, 2001).\nThere are two sand islands, Farol and Cemit\u00e9rio. The research base was constructed at the Farol Island, and it is surrounded by low-standing vegetation that is used as nesting sites for thousands of marine birds. In the middle of this cay there is the Lama Bay, whose fauna depends on the tide dynamics, and it is usually a refugee area for juvenile lemon sharks. Rocas' sedimentary environment is composed entirely of carbonate skeleton derived from its own reef\nstructure, which goes through continuous degradation by physical processes such as wave action (PEREIRA et al., 2013).\nThe climate is equatorial, and the prevailing wind directions is from southeasterly with maximum wind speed of 11 m s-1 (HOFLICH, 1984). There is a rainy season from approximately March through July and a dry season from approximately August through February (APAC, 2016). The tides range from 0-3.8 m in a semi-diurnal and mesotidal regime, resulting in a half-daily cycle of almost complete submersion during high tide (only the sandy islands remain emerged) and almost complete emersion during low tide. This tidal dynamics results in strong currents when the atoll is either filling or draining and during high tides (GHERARDI and BOSENCE, 2001). The available reef area in its internal portion during the low tide, when tidal currents have ceased, can be distinguished in three main habitats: the shallow permanent lagoon, and the open and closed pools. Open pools communicate with the exterior of the atoll even during low tides, and are more exposed to wave action than closed pools, which remain completely isolated from the exterior area of the atoll during low tide (LONGO et al. 2015).\nFigure 17 - Studied areas at Rocas Atoll, indicating the sampling sites. Stations near the channels: pentagon (Station I) and star (Station II); Closed pools: CM (Cemit\u00e9rio); TA (Tartarugas); AC (\u00c2ncoras); PO (Porites) and Open pools: PC (Podes Crer) and SL (Sal\u00e3o). Adapted from PEREIRA et al., 2013.\nThe available reef area in its internal portion during the low tide, when tidal currents have ceased, can be distinguished in three main habitats: the shallow permanent lagoon, and\nthe open and closed pools. Open pools communicate with the exterior of the atoll even during low tides, and are more exposed to wave action than closed pools, which remain completely isolated from the exterior area of the atoll during low tide (LONGO et al. 2015).\n6.2.5.\tMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe data was sampled during December 2012 through December 2014. In total, were six research expeditions to Rocas Atoll, lasting between 3 to 4 weeks, four during the dry and two during the rainy season. Two open pools (Sal\u00e3o and Podes Crer), four closed ones (Cemit\u00e9rio, Tartarugas, \u00c2ncoras and Porites) and two fixed stations, one in each extremity of Farol's island were chosen as sampling sites. Station I is a shallow pond, that during the slack water period (about 3 hours between the end of the ebb tide trough the low tide and the begging of the flood tide) reaches around 0.7 m deep. This station receives influence from the Lama Bay discharge during the ebb tide and during the flood and spring tides from the Barretinha Channel (Northwest). The station II is the shallowest, with average 0.4 m water depth during the slack water period and receives influence from the Barret\u00e3o Channel (North).\nHydrology\nSeawater samples were collected using Niskin bottle during the low tide at the subsurface and near the bottom of the pools and at the fixed stations, the water samples were collected only at sub surface in intervals of 2 hours for 12 hours. Abiotic parameters such as water temperature (C) and pH (total) were determined in situ, using a HANNA electrode with 0.01 precision. Dissolved oxygen (DO) analysis were carried out at the Rocas Atoll research station within 24 hours (with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.03 mL. L-1) according to the modified methodology of Winkler, described at STRICKLAND and PARSONS (1972). Other parameters such as salinity (S), total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic nutrients were analyzed in the laboratory of chemical oceanography at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE). Seawater samples were poisoned with saturated mercuric chloride (DICKSON et al., 2007) and TA was measured by open cell titration as described in ROUNDS (2012). The quality of the measurements was confirmed by analyzing certified reference materials (Batch 132) provided by Andrew Dickson, from Scripps Institution of Oceanography before and after a round of samples. Measurements were corrected based on the mean difference between the measured and the certified values of the CRMs (accuracy 4.94%). Replicates of seawater samples (50 mL) were kept protected from temperature and light variations, and used to\nmeasure the salinity according to the Mohr-Knudsen method described by STRICKLAND and PARSONS (1972). Other seawater replicates (500 mL) were immediately frozen in Rocas and transported to the laboratory were levels of phosphate, nitrate, nitrite (STRICKLAND and PARSONS, 1972) and silica (GRASSHOFF et al., 1983) were determined.\nBenthic coverage\nCeramic tiles (225cm2), conditioned for three months, were arranged into settlement units and deployed at \u00c2ncoras, Cemit\u00e9rio, Porites and Podes Crer pools. From December 2012 through December 2013, 10 unites were distributed per pool. Each unit consisted of four pairs of tiles separated by a PVC ring of three cm. The units were fixed at the reef on the horizontal and vertical positions (Fig. 18 a, b). From December 2013 to December 2014, we changed the deployment of the tiles. Throughout this period, the settlement units consisted in 18 pairs of tiles, divided in three different orientations (vertical, horizontal and inclined 45\u00b0), randomly arranged into a stainless steel mesh and anchored at the sand bottoms of the pools. In each pool, we installed three settlement unit (Fig. 18 c, d).\nAt the end of each year the settlement plates were collected from the pools and transported to the scientific station were they were analyzed under stereomicroscope and photographed. The density of organisms from different categories was then determined: bryozoans (Bry), vermetidis (Verm), serpulids (Serp) and corals (Coral). When present, coral recruits were identified and measured. To estimate the benthic coverage of macroalgae (MAL) and crustose coralline algae (CCA), the area (cm2) occupied by those organisms was measured with the software ImageJ using the photography of the plates. During the expedition of November 2014, the benthic coverage on the pools was also evaluated with point intercept transect surveys. Sal\u00e3o pool was the only one where transect observations were not carried out due to unsafe dive conditions. In total, four transects of 20 m, with 40 points at 0.5 m intervals, and 5m apart from one another were evaluated in each pool by scuba diver. The identification of the organisms were grouped in categories as follow: macroalgae (MAL), turf algae (TUR) -layer of tightly, crustose coralline algae (CCA), sponge (ESP), sand (SAND), Zoanthus sociatus (ZSO), and the corals Mussismilia hispida (MHI), Porites astreoides (PAS) and Siderastrea stellata (SST).\nFigure 18 - Settlement units displayed in 2013 (a, b) and 2014 (c, d) at tidal pools in Rocas atoll.\nData analysis\nThe environmental variables were tested for significance by comparing the different sampling sites (\u00c2ncoras, Cemit\u00e9rio, Porites, Tartarugas, Podes Crer, Sal\u00e3o, and Fixed station I and II), grouped sites (open pools, closed pools and channels), climate periods (dry and rainy season) and sampling years (2012-2014), with Wilcoxon/Kruskall-Wallis tests. The benthic coverage categories of the settlement plates were compared by sampling sites and sampling years also with Wilcoxon/Kruskall-Wallis tests. To explore potential relationships between the abiotic parameters and the structure of the benthic community we conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Statistical analyses were performed using the software JMP\u00ae10.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc., 2012) and the level of significance adopted was 0.05.\n6.2.6.\tRESULTS\nThe annual average precipitation (Fig. 19) for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 were 89.9\u00b192.9mm, 87\u00b1101mm and 106\u00b1120mm, respectively. During the present study, the main pluviometry was 172\u00b192.2mm for the rainy season (February until July) and 16.9\u00b120.7mm for the dry season (August until January).\nAt the fixed stations it was observed diurnal variations for some of the environment\nFigure 99 - Monthly precipitation (mm) of the region throughout the years of study. Source: APAC, 2016 for Fernando de Noronha station.\nparameters analyzed, such as temperature, pH, and DO that presented lower values from 5 pm until 8 am and high values around 10 am and 4 pm. Total alkalinity did not show a significant variation along the day, but indicate a tendency of high values during nighttime and lower values along the day (Fig. 20 a). Unlike the variables described before, the nutrient salts and silica did not show diurnal variations (Fig. 20 b).\nFigure 20 - Daily and seasonal variations of the environmental parameters collected at the fixed stations at Rocas atoll.

The fixed stations near the channels showed the largest values (2520\u00b1107 gmol. Kg-\u2122) of TA and of PO4 (0.47\u00b1 0.51 gM) when compared to open and closed pools. At the open pools, it was observed high average values for DO (5.77\u00b11.04 mL.L-1) and pH (8.38\u00b10.18). Analyzes of variations among the sampling points, indicates the influence of the pH values measured at Podes Crer pool in this difference mentioned above.

DO, phosphate and salinity showed seasonal variation with higher values generally observed in the dry season and temperature more often displayed larger values during the rainy season (Table 2).\nThe benthic coverage at Rocas pools was evaluated with two different methodologies. The results obtained for algal cover was similar in both methodologies, the open pool showed high coverage of CCA, while the close pools where dominated by macro and turf algae. However, it was observed only seven coral recruits on the settlement experiment, and the coral cover was better estimated with transects.\nOverall, the macroalgae (MAL) was the most abundant benthic coverage in the settlement plates, ranging from 74.7\u00b1 23.9% at Cemit\u00e9rio and 35.8\u00b1 20.4 % at Podes Crer. It was observed significant difference between the pools, Cemit\u00e9rio and \u00c2ncoras presented the highest MAL percentage and Tartarugas and Podes Crer the lowest. Podes Crer was the pool with higher crustose carbonate algae coverage (CCA%). For this open pool it was possible to recover the ceramic tiles on both years studied, therefore, annual differences in the recruitment could be tested. In 2013, the surface area coverage by CCA was 61.3\u00b1 41.2 cm2 while in 2014 was 115\u00b1 69.8 cm2. The percentage of area with no recruitment was significantly different for Tartarugas settlement plates, were about half of the surface area was not colonized (nude) (Table 3).\nThe density of bryozoans (BRY) was similar at \u00c2ncoras and Tartarugas with 41.7\u00b1 62.7 individuals per 225 cm2 and 21.1\u00b1 36.1 individuals per 225 cm2 respectively. There was no difference between the densities of serpulids polichaetes (mainly Spirobis sp.) among the pools in 2013, but the density observed at Podes Crer in 2014 was significantly lower than the one for the previous year. The density of vermetids represented by two different species identified on the plates (Pentaloconchus sp. e Dendropoma sp.) was significantly lower than the ones observed for bryozoans and serpulids. However, they show the same pattern of distribution as bryozoans among the pools. \u00c2ncoras and Tartarugas formed the group of pools with higher density while Cemit\u00e9rio and Podes crer showed the lowest (Table 3).\nIt was not observed variations on coral recruitment. In 2013, four recruits were recognized, one Siderastrea sp. and two Porites sp. at Podes Crer and one at Porites sp \u00c2ncoras (Fig. 21). In 2014, two recruits of Siderastrea sp. and one Porites sp. were observed at Podes Crer.\nTable 3.

The most abundant category at the only open pool surveyed (Podes Crer) was CCA, which represents 42.7% of the coverage, followed by the percentage of Siderastrea stellata coverage (29.9%). While for all closed pools, the non calcified algal turfs (TUR) was the dominant category, with 62.2% at Porites, 40.7% at Cemit\u00e9rio, 34.4% at \u00c2ncoras and 25% at Tartarugas.\nFigure 22 - Percent coverage of the main benthic categories observed at Rocas atoll tidal pools. macroalgae (MAL), turf algae (TUR), crustose coralline algae (CCA), sponge (ESP), sand (SAND), Zoanthus sociatus (ZSO), Mussismilia hispida (MHI), Porites astreoides (PAS) and Siderastrea stellata (SST).\nPool\nCategory SAND\n\u25a0\tMAL\n\u25a0\tTUR\n\u25a0\tCCA ESP\n\u25a0\tZSO\n\u25a0\tMHI\n\u25a0\tpas\n\u25a0\tSST\nThe interaction between the abiotic parameters and benthic community at Rocas pools was investigated with PCA. The PCA revels that two sets of components explained 75.9% (Fig 23. A) and 72.5% (Fig 23. B) of the variances included in those environmental parameters. While samples from the open pool (Podes Crer) were grouped by direct association between temperature, pH, DO, salinity, CCA and corals, samples from closed pools (Cemit\u00e9rio) were separated by the positive correlation from MAL, TUR, SAND and opposite to the availability of nutrient.\nTherefore, results from this analyses suggests the tendency of habitats with high coverage of carbonatic organisms consume the alkalinity of seawater, and habitats with elevated abundance of algae (MAL and TUR) are direct related to the assimilation of dissolved inorganic nutrients.\nFigure 23 - Principal Component Analyzes of hydrological data and benthic coverage obtained at the settlement plates (A) and point intercept transects (B).

These diurnal changes suggest a link with tides, daily solar cycle, and the volume exchange with semi-enclosed pools. Nonetheless, they also demonstrate the ability of Rocas Atoll organisms\u2019 metabolism to alter open superficial seawater characteristics. One evidence that the biology may influence these abiotic parameters is the similar daily\nvariation between pH and DO. These parameters showed values increasing along the day, when photosynthesis is taking place and an inverted pattern at night, due to the dominance of respiratory processes (ANTHONY et al. 2011; SHAW et al. 2012). Accordingly, processes of calcification and dissolution may be responsible for the variation on TA values (ALBRIGHT et al., 2016).\nThe present study also observed seasonal variations in temperature, salinity and phosphate. JALES (2015), studying phytoplankton seasonal and spatial variations at Rocas, also observed higher temperatures during the rainy season, however, the salinity reported was also high (36.2). In the present study the salinity recorded was 34.8\u00b11.22 for the rainy and 36\u00b10.65 for the dry season. It is more likely that the difference in the methodologies to obtain these values are responsible for the variation among the studies, since JALES (2015) used a manual Atago refractometer, model S/Mill-E with a scale range of 0 to 100 and an interval of 1, and we adopted the Mohr-Knudsen method. The results of this study are in accordance with FEITOSA and PASSAVANTE (2004) that obtained a salinity of 35.29 (Mohr- Knudsen method) for the dry season (January 1999).\nAmongst the fixed stations, it was clear the impact of the Lama Bay over the nutrients concentration in station I. The results indicate an influence of the excrement of seabirds that can be washed away during the tide dynamics. The phosphate concentration was higher at station I, and those values contributed to the seasonal variation reported here. Swell events occurred during the dry season increased the hydrodynamics at the atoll, causing relatively longer periods of water residence time at Lama Bay (PINHEIRO, Pers. Comm), suggesting more dilution of the seabirds\u2019 guano. The influence of the seabirds\u2019 excrement on the concentration of nutrients was also discussed by FEITOSA and PASSAVANTE (2004).\nAmong the sampling sites, it was chosen two open pools, and in between them, the Sal\u00e3o presented more constant values for the abiotic parameters studied, similar to the observed for oceanic waters surrounding the atoll (JALES, et al., in press). Unfortunately, due to persistent strong waves and currents, it was not possible to realize the transects and the settlement units we deployed were completely destroyed. In contrast, Podes Crer showed significant variations compared to all the other pools: lowest TA (2339\u00b1122 gmol.K#\u2014J) and highest pH (8.49\u00b10.17), and SiO2 (10.9\u00b1 12.2 |iM), and those results seem to influence its benthic cover.\nThe number of coral recruits observed during the study was extremely low compared to recruitment rates observed at others reef ecosystems in northeastern Brazil (MAIDA; FERREIRA, 1995; CASTRO et al., 2006). Variations in recruitment rates are generally attributed to factors such as fluctuations in larvae production (SAMMARCO; ANDREWS, 1988), planktonic phase survival (BAK; ENGLE, 1979), and post-settlement mortality processes, which occurs by predation, competition with other organisms on the substrate and premature death of individuals settled on inappropriate substrate (FABRICIUS; METZNER, 2004). Abiotic factors such as light, temperature, salinity and sedimentation have also been observed to influence the recruitment process and may induce or inhibit settlement (SAMMARCO 1983; RUIZ-Z\u00c1RATE; ARIAS-GONZALEZ, 2004).\nPINHEIRO et al. (in press), studying some aspects of the dominant coral specie (Siderastrea stellata) life history at Rocas, point out that 41.2\u00b1 18.5% of its population is considered mature (diameters higher than 10 cm) and has a high potential of maintenance and recovery. However, they observed a low frequency of young colonies with diameters ranging from 0 to 2 (1.8\u00b11.12%) and 2.1- 4 cm (8.9\u00b13.87%) that may be a consequence of a reduced recruitment event caused by two sequential positive sea surface temperature anomalies (2009 and 2010) (FERREIRA et al. 2012). It is possible that the results observed here indicate this impact of warming waters on coral reproduction, but further studies about larval dispersal, tidal dynamics, and polyp fecundity rates are necessary in order to draw solid conclusions about the recruitment failure event.\nAlthough only S. stellata, P. asteroides and M. hispida were shown in the present study, Montastrea cavernosa, Favia gravida, Porites branneri and Madracis decactis, were also observed during the fieldwork, but not recorded as results due to the methodology and low abundance (PINHEIRO, per comm.) The total coral coverage we found was 33.15% at Tartarugas, 29.9 at Podes Crer, 12.51% at \u00c2ncoras, 5.93% at Cemit\u00e9rio and 1.22% at Porites. Those results are in accordance with a previous study by FERREIRA et al (2012) that observed\n50.6\t\u00b16.0 % at Sal\u00e3o; 34.0 \u00b114.2% at Podes Crer; followed by 22.5 \u00b17.8% in Tartarugas and the lowest coverage, 5.6 \u00b16.1% at Cemit\u00e9rio.\nTurf algae and macroalgae were the most representative categories of benthic cover respectively at transects and settlement plates methodologies. In a study conducted by LONGO et al. (2015), the algal turfs were also the dominant group in tidal pools inside the atoll.\nHowever, they classified the turf in two categories; articulated calcareous algae largely dominated algal turfs of open pools, whereas turfs from closed pools presented a greater contribution of non-calcified algae. In their research, it was considered comparative analysis of the reef fish assemblage, benthic cover, the composition, nutritional traits and associated cryptofauna of algal turfs, and fish feeding pressure on benthos. They found differences in patterns of community structure and feeding pressure on benthos between the open and closed pools, and attributed those differences also to the distinct hydrodynamic conditions and related amount of sediment in open and closed pools.\nIn the present study, the PCA showed a clear correlation between the benthic coverage and abiotic parameters that corroborated the findings of LONGO et al (2015). Habitats with high coverage of carbonatic organisms were direct correlated with temperature, pH, and DO, and indirect correlated with the alkalinity of seawater, whereas habitats with elevated abundance of macro and turf algae were indirect associated with the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients.\n6.2.8.\tCONCLUSION\nHere we presented an integrated approach describing environment variables and its associations at shallow reef habitats at Rocas atoll. Our main results suggest that:\n(1)\tAbiotic parameters variations might be related with tides, daily solar cycle, and volume exchange from semi-enclosed pools as well as organisms\u2019 metabolisms (photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and dissolution) and seabirds\u2019 excrements.\n(2)\tThe availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients on the seawater may contribute for the distribution of the organisms in the atoll, since sites with dominance of macro and turf algae were indirectly associated with the concentration of nutrients.\n(3)\tHabitats with high frequency of carbonatic organisms might be associated with decreased concentration of alkalinity.\n(4)\tThe number of corals settled on the ceramic tiles was low when compared to recruitment rates of others studies in Brazil and may indicate an impact of warming waters on coral reproduction, however, further studies about larval dispersal, and polyp fecundity rates are necessary to draw solid conclusions about the recruitment failure event.\nNevertheless, especially due to the predicted effects of increasing CO2 in the atmosphere (ocean warming and acidification), that can bring negatives impacts on carbonatic organisms and positive ones on macroalgae, it is recommended to closely monitor such interaction. Rocas, as the only atoll in the South Atlantic and the first and more effective marine reserve in Brazil, needs to be alert to the consequences of potential phase shifts processes there are happening in other reefs around the world.\nManuscrito 3- Rocas Atoll, an example of how a reef ecosystem modulates and interferes with the seawater carbonate chemistry: submetido para publica\u00e7\u00e3o na Marine and Freshwater Research.\nFigure 24 - Garrafa de Niskin utilizada na coleta de amostras de \u00e1gua para an\u00e1lises qu\u00edmicas.

The Rocas Atoll, in the tropical South Atlantic Ocean is a marine reserve since 1979 and a great laboratory to study the dynamics of the carbonate system, once the reef environment is in equilibrium and isolated of any coastal and anthropic influences. We aimed to evaluate the diurnal and seasonal variation as well the hydrodynamic influence over the carbonate parameters at the atoll. These parameters were calculated using the total alkalinity (TA), pH, temperature and salinity values, collected at two fixed stations inside the Rocas Atoll and at six pools of the atoll ring. By the metabolic rates analysis (net ecosystem calcification -NEC and net community production - NCP) we observed that the organic production (via photosynthesis) relative to calcification indicates that NCP is the primary controlling influence on carbonate chemistry in the pools inside the Rocas Atoll. The elevated concentration of carbonate ions, and therefore also values of aragonite saturation state, suggest that the intense biological activity happening inside the atoll could mitigate some of the effects of ocean acidification and also function as a small additional sink for anthropogenic CO2 during the wet season.\n7.1.2.\tResumo\nO aumento na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica do di\u00f3xido de carbono (CO2) tem afetado a qu\u00edmica do sistema carbonato marinho, e v\u00e1rios estudos indicam que os ecossistemas de recifes de coral s\u00e3o os mais amea\u00e7ados por essas mudan\u00e7as.

Esses par\u00e2metros foram calculados a partir dos valores de alcalinidade total (AT), pH, temperatura e salinidade coletados em duas esta\u00e7\u00f5es fixas dentro do Atol sob influ\u00eancia do mar de fora e em seis piscinas de mar\u00e9. Atrav\u00e9s das an\u00e1lises das taxas metab\u00f3licas (taxa l\u00edquida de calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o - TLC e produtividade l\u00edquida- PL)\nn\u00f3s observamos que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o org\u00e2nica (via fotoss\u00edntese) relativa a calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o indica que a PL \u00e9 o principal fator que influencia a qu\u00edmica do sistema carbonato nas piscinas de mar\u00e9.

Nonetheless, the CO2 do not only stay in the atmosphere with another gases and water vapor causing the greenhouse effect, it is also absorbed by the ocean's surface. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, around 30-40% of the anthropogenic CO2 has been absorbed by the world's surface oceans each year (BINDOFF et al., 2007). The CO2 that dissolves into the oceans reacts with the water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3) and its dissociation products, bicarbonate (HCO- ) and carbonate (CO-2 ) (MILLERO, 2007).\nThe rising concentration of CO2 (atms) is changing the carbonate chemistry of the oceans, concentrations of CO2 (aq) and HCO- are increasing, while the concentrations of CO3~ and the pH of seawater decreases; with these changes collectively referred to as ocean acidification (KLEYPAS et al., 1999a; CALDEIRA; WICKETT, 2003; ORR et al., 2005). Serious concerns about the potential effects of ocean acidification (OA) on marine organisms and ecosystems, especially those organisms producing shells, tests or skeletons of calcium carbonate are growing (ANDERSSON et al., 2007). The fate of tropical coral reefs and scleractinian corals, in particular, have received most of the attention in the ongoing OA discussion (KLEYPAS et al., 1999 a, b; HOEGH-GULDBERG et al., 2007; KROEKER et al.,\n2013). The most probable consequences of OA and warming for reef ecosystems are usually considered as reduction on calcification/ reef accretion and increased frequency and severity of coral bleaching respectively (ALBRIGHT; MASON, 2013).\nAccording to ANDERSSON et al. (2013), projections of future seawater CO2 chemistry have been focused simply on changes in the pH and aragonite saturation state (Dar) of open\nocean surface seawater conditions surrounding coral reefs, rather than the reef systems themselves (FEELY et al., 2009; SILVERMAN et al., 2009; ZEEBE, 2012). Only recently, in situ natural variability in the carbonate chemistry has been utilized to investigate coral reef community calcification, to understand the carbon cycle on reefs and to predict and monitor the effects of OA (SHAW et al., 2012; SILVERMAN et al., 2012; ALBRIGHT et al., 2013; ANDERSSON et al., 2013; CYRONAK et al., 2014; MURILLO et al., 2014).\nThe coral reef carbon cycle is mainly driven by two biogeochemical processes, organic carbon metabolism (photosynthesis and its opposite effect, respiration) causing variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations, and inorganic carbon metabolism (calcification and its opposite effect, dissolution) which alters both, the total alkalinity (TA) and DIC concentrations in a proportion of ~2:1 (ALBRIGHT et al., 2013). On reef systems, several environmental factors including benthic community composition, biological activity (which can vary with temperature, light and nutrient availability), salinity, tidal regime, water depth and residence time can dictate the variation of the carbonate chemistry. As a result, it is observed large fluctuations in both diurnal and seasonal timescales that can vary from reef to reef, and often differ from open ocean conditions (ALBRIGHT et al., 2013).\nIn the tropical South Atlantic Ocean coral reef communities were recorded from the Parcel do Manuel Luis' State Marine Park (00\u00b053'S) to Cabo Frio (23\u00b0S), and in the Fernando de Noronha archipelago and Rocas Atoll, but the southernmost true reefs are in Abrolhos area (18\u00b0S) (CASTRO; PIRES, 2001). According to KERR et al. (2015), the Western South Atlantic Ocean lacks appropriate observations for determining regional OA effects, including the effects of OA on key sensitive Brazilian ecosystem, such as coral reefs. Following the trend of the rest of the world, most of the available CO2 system data for the South Atlantic was collected from research cruises or moored buoys on the open ocean, aiming the evaluation of air-sea CO2 fluxes (LEFREVE et al., 2008) and climatological distribution of the carbonate chemistry parameters (TAKAHASHI et al., 2014). Some studies were conducted on the coastal area, with the vast majority on rivers and estuarine ecosystem, evaluating their importance to the global carbon budget (ABRIL et al., 2013). In situ measurements of carbonate system parameters for a coastal coral reef system was only reported by LONGHINI et al., (2015). Some projects investigating the effects of rising CO2atm in the ocean and in coastal ecosystems are ongoing (e.g. PIRATA, CARECOS, CORAL VIVO, INCT Amb-Trop) (KERR et al., 2015).\nThe lack of knowledge concerning natural variability of carbonate chemistry on reef ecosystem in the Tropical South Atlantic ocean, and how those ecosystem modulate and interfere on the surrounding seawater, were the main drivers for this study. Rocas Atoll, a pristine reef environment, and Brazilian Federal Marine Biological Reserve since 1979, was chosen due to its isolation from different anthropogenic effects as fishing, tourism and other direct human impacts. Its architecture relies on carbonate-secreting organisms, and therefore, as other reef ecosystem, ocean warming and acidification seriously threaten it. In addition to collaborate with new in situ data to enable better accuracy on the prediction of ocean acidification effects on coral reefs ecosystem, we aimed to evaluate the Rocas Atoll susceptibility to projected changes in ocean biogeochemistry.\n7.1.4.\tMETHODS\nStudy site\nThe Rocas Atoll (3\u00b051\u2019S; 33\u00b0 49\u2019W) lays at 266 km offshore from the closest point in mainland Brazil and 145 km from the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (Brazil) (Fig. 25). It is one of the smallest atolls in the world, with an axis of 3.35 km by 2.49 km, a reef area of 6.56 km2 and a perimeter of 11 km (PEREIRA et al., 2010).\nThe climate in the region is equatorial, and the prevailing wind direction is southeasterly with maximum wind speeds of 11 m s-1 (HOFLICH, 1984). The tidal regime is semi-diurnal, mesotidal, and hence can cause very strong tidal currents over the reef (GHERARDI; BOSENCE, 2001). However, there is no available data of tidal range from Rocas Atoll, the data available is from Fernando de Noronha\u2019s Harbor which shows a maximum height of 2.8 m\n(DHN, 2014). Rainfall is mainly concentrated from March through July (wet season) (APAC, 2016).\nFigure 25 - Location of the Rocas Atoll and location of the pools and fixed stations where the water samples were collected. Stations near the channels: pentagon (Station I) and star (Station II); Closed pools: CM (Cemit\u00e9rio); TA (Tartarugas); AC (\u00c2ncoras); PO (Porites) and Open pools: PC (Podes Crer) and SL (Sal\u00e3o). Adapted from PEREIRA et al., 2013\nThe reef is constructed almost exclusively by encrusting coralline red algae and the secondary framework builders is composed by vermetid gastropods, encrusting foraminifera, Polychaeta worm tubes, and corals (KIKUCHI; LE\u00c3O, 1997; GHERARDI; BOSENCE, 2001). There are two sandy islands, Farol and Cemit\u00e9rio. The research base was constructed at the Farol Island, and is surrounded by low-standing vegetation that is used as nesting sites for thousands of marine birds. In the middle of this cay there is the Lama Bay. The Rocas' sedimentary environment is composed entirely of carbonate skeleton derived from its own reef structure, which goes through continuous degradation by physical processes such as wave action (PEREIRA et al., 2013)\nWater sampling and analysis\nFour expeditions to the atoll were realized, two during the dry season (October 2013 and December 2013-January 2014) and two during the wet season (February-March and May\n2014). Discrete water samples were collected at two fixed stations placed in two shallow tide pools, (maximum depth at high tide 2.3 m) at the extremities of Farol Island, and near the channels that connect the lagoon with the open ocean (Fig. 25). These remain without direct hydraulic connection with the sea during low tide. The station I is a shallow pond that during the slack water period (about 3 hours between the end of the ebb tide trough the low tide and the begging of the flood tide) reaches around 0.7 m deep, receives influence from the Lama Bay discharge during the ebb tide and during the flood tide from the Barretinha Channel. The station II is shallower, with average 0.4 m water deep during the slack water period and receives influence from the Barret\u00e3o Channel. At the two fixed stations, water samples were collected every ~2 hours during one full tidal period (12 hours).\nAdditionally, six selected pools (depth between 3 and 10 m) on the reef crest (atoll ring) were sampled during the low tide at the sub-surface (between 10 and 30 cm bellow surface). Four of the selected pools remain without direct hydraulic connection with the sea during low tide (Cemit\u00e9rio, Tartarugas, \u00c2ncoras and Porites, Fig. 25). The other two are permanently connected with the open ocean (Sal\u00e3o and Podes Crer). The hard coral coverage is higher in the pools permanently connected with the open ocean. Reef Check surveys made in 2007 and 2010 reported 34%\u00b1 14.2 and 50.6%\u00b1 6.0 to Podes Crer and Sal\u00e3o, respectively. At the closed pools they observed coverage of 22.5\u00b1 7.8% at Tartarugas and 5.6\u00b1 6.1% at Cemit\u00e9rio (FERREIRA et al., 2012).\nWater samples were collected from Niskin bottle into 125 mL and 300 mL amber glass bottles with screw cap lid, preventing the formation of air bubbles in the drawing tube and sample bottles. The 125 mL sample was fixed on site for dissolved oxygen (DO) analysis and the 300 mL sample was poisoned with 200^l of saturated mercuric chloride for total alkalinity (TA) determinations. Plastic bottles of 100 mL were used to collect samples to salinity. Abiotic parameters such as water temperature (\u00b0C) and pH were determined in situ, using a HANNA electrode with 0.01 precision. DO analysis were carried out at the Rocas Atoll research station within 24 hours after collection (with an accuracy of \u00b1 1.3 Limol L-1) according to the methodology of Winkler modified, described at STRICKLAND and PARSONS (1972).\nSalinity was measured according to the Mohr-Knudsen method described by STRICKLAND and PARSONS (1972), and TA was measured by titrating 50 ml of seawater in an open cell with sulfuric acid 18 mN as described in ROUNDS (2012). The quality of the measurements was confirmed by analyzing certified reference materials (Batch 132) provided by Andrew Dickson, from Scripps Institution of Oceanography before and after a round of samples. Measurements were corrected based on the mean difference between the measured and the certified values of the CRMs (accuracy 4.94%).\nCarbonate chemistry\nDIC, pCO2, Oat and concentrations of the bicarbonate [HCO3] and carbonate [CO3] ions were calculated from the TA, pH, temperature and salinity data using the Excel macro- CO2SYS (PIERROT et al., 2006), with the carbonic acid dissociation constants of MEHRBACK et al. (1973) as refit by DICKSON and MILLERO (1987) and the Kso4 for the bisulfate ion from DICKSON (1990).\nNet ecosystem calcification (NEC) and Net community production (NCP) calculations\nThe metabolic rates (NEC, mmol CaCO3 m-2 h-1 and NCP, mmol C m-2 h-1) for each day where calculated according to LANGDON et al. (2010), during the slack water period at low tide, using the equations bellow:\nnec =\nACLATA\n(1)\nwhere ATA is the change in total alkalinity (mmol kg-1), p is the density of the seawater (kg m 3), h is the mean water depth (m) and At is the time interval between observations (h).\n, ADIC-0.5ATA .\nnep = -hp----------------kS(pCO2 w - pCO2 J,\t(2)\nwhere ADIC is the change in dissolved inorganic carbon (mmol kg-1), and the term kS(pCO2 w \u2014 pCO2 a), approximates gas transfer flux, calculated using the difference between the average pCO2 of two consecutive measurements in seawater and atmospheric pCO2. The values of pCO2 were obtained at Earth system Research laboratory from NOAA, at Maxaranguape-RN station, and the average for the dry and wet season were the same, 396 patm. k is the gas transfer velocity and S is the solubility of CO2 calculated as a function of salinity and temperature. All other parameters are defined above. The wind speed parameterization of\nHO et al. (2006) was used to calculate k, and the mean wind speed for each day was obtained from Fernando de Noronha station at the National Institute for Space research - Integrated System of Environmental Data (INPE/ SINDA, 2014).\nHydrodynamics influence\nTo further exam the influence of the hydrodynamics at Rocas, we grouped the data in three categories: open pools (Sal\u00e3o and Podes Crer, connected to the open ocean); closed pools (Cemit\u00e9rio, Tartarugas, \u00c2ncoras and Porites, isolated from the open ocean during the low tide) and the data collected at the fixed stations near the channels. The values of TA and DIC were\nsalinity- normalized (by multiplying their values by the ratio of 36 to the measured in situ\nsalinity), allowing a simple comparison between them. It was assumed that for every mol of organic carbon produced (via photosynthesis), one mol of DIC is consumed, and TA remains\nunchanged, and that for every mol of CaCO3 produced (during calcification), TA decreases by\n2 mol and DIC decreases by 1 mol. Therefore, it was considered the NEC: NCP ratio as\n1\nER\nwhere m is the slope of the TA- DIC line for each group of data (ALBRIGHT et al., 2013).\nStatistical treatment\nWe used analysis of variance, ANOVA to examine the seasonal and spatial variation in the carbonate chemistry parameters. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to check the normality of the data and the Levene\u2019s test the homoscedasticity of the variances. It was assumed a significance level of 0.05.\n7.1.5.\tRESULTS\nIn general, the Rainfall regime at Rocas Atoll present a clear seasonality, the dry period occurs from September to February and the wet one from March to August. Data collected from the meteorological station at Fernando de Noronha (APAC, 2016) was used to characterized the Dry - Wet seasons for the period of this study (Fig. 26). The average precipitation on the dry season, from October 2013 to February 2014, was 10.9\u00b1 17.2 mm and the wet season from\nMarch to May 2014 was 124\u00b1 95.8 mm. The average wind speed was 8.52\u00b1 1.47 m s-1 at the dry season and 6.97\u00b1 1.66 m s-1 at the wet one.\nFigure 26 - Pluviometry (mm) and wind speed (m s-1) at 10m collected from the Fernando de Noronha's meteorological station, characterizing the dry and wet season during the period of the study.\nDaytime and Seasonal variations\nThe diurnal and seasonal variations of the physical and chemical parameters of the seawater collected at the fixed station near the channels, and the closed and pools are presented at Figure 27 and Table 4. The average seawater temperature measured inside Rocas Atoll was 28.3\u00b1 1.61 \u00b0C and it varies in diurnal and seasonal scales (ANOVA, p<0.001). Early in the mornings the temperature were colder (min. 24.8\u00b0C), warming along the day between noon and early afternoon (max. 32.4 \u00b0C) and getting colder again by the end of the day (Fig 27.A). The temperature was colder during the dry season and warmer at the wet one, averaging 27.98\u00b1 1.5 and 28.85\u00b1 1.5\u00b0C respectively. The values of pHsw, Qat and COf- also presented this pattern (Fig. 27 D, H and J), varying along the day and season (ANOVA, p<0.001). In the beginning and the end of the day, the values were lower than during noon and early afternoon. The average values observed during the study were 8.35\u00b1 0.17 pH, 6.29\u00b1 1.47 Qat and 392\u00b1 89 pmol kg-W for COf-. During the wet season the average values were higher (pH 8.42\u00b1 0.18; Q.\\r 6.87\u00b1 1.5; 427\u00b1 93 pmol kg-W for COf-) than the dry one (pH 8.35\u00b1 0.18; Qat 5.96\u00b1 1.3; 372\u00b1 80 pmol kg-W for COf-). Although it was not found significant difference among the sampling sites\ngrouped, the extreme values of those parameters were always observed on the shallow fixed stations near the channels.\nThe daytime distribution pattern of DIC, pC\u00dc2 and HCO- mirrored the ones of temperature, pHsw, Oat and COf-, with the higher values found early in the morning and late at night and lowering throughout the day, with minimum values usually around noon (Fig. 27 F, G and I). Those parameters also presented significant difference between season and hydrodynamics of the sampling groups (Table 4). The higher average values were found during the dry period: DIC= 1806\u00b1 161 gmol kg-W, pC\u00dc2= 189\u00b1 90 gatm and HCO- = 1430\u00b1 232 gmol kg-W. The averages for the wet season were DIC= 1685\u00b1 202 gmol kg-W, pC\u00dc2= 141\u00b1 96 gatm and HCO- = 1255\u00b1 287 gmol kg-W. The pools connected with the open ocean (Sal\u00e3o and Podes Crer) presented the lowest average values for DIC and HCO-. For pC\u00dc2, these pools also presented the lowest values, but it was not significantly different from the values found at the closed pools, only differing from the ones collected at the fixed station near the channels.\nDO(mol.L-l) pH (sw)\tSalinity\tTA\tTemp (C)\nFigure 27 - Diurnal and seasonal variation of the physical and chemical parameters of the seawater collected at the fixed station near the channels (crosses), closed pools (filled circles) and open pools (open circles).

Mean \u00b1SD and range values from all the physical and chemical parameters sampled at fixed stations and pools inside the ring of Rocas Atoll showing the seasonal and hydrodynamics variations. (*) highlight significant difference of the means (ANOVA, p<0.05)\nIt was only observed a significant difference of DO values among the seasons (ANOVA, p<0.0001), the average during the dry period was 5.3\u00b1 0.9 mol L-1 and during the wet one was 6.87\u00b1 1.2 mol L-1. Although it is possible to observe a tendency of variation throughout the day (Fig. 27 E), with the lower values found at the fixed stations during the begging and in the end of the day, while the highest values were recorded around noon.\nTA values (Fig. 27B) vary according the daytime and site, with average of 2339\u00b1 77 gmol kg-W for the study. Early in the mornings, the values were higher and decreased along the day and the samples collected on the fixed stations near the channels were on average higher than the ones collected on the closed and open pools, mean values of 2359\u00b1 88, 2314\u00b1 35 and 2278\u00b1 68 gmol kg-W respectively. Salinity was the only parameter constant throughout the study (Table 4), did not vary along the day, nor seasonally or among the sampling groups, and presented a mean value of 35.9\u00b1 0.55 (Fig. 27 C).\nMetabolic rates\nRates of NEC and NCP calculated using equations (1) and (2), during the slack water period at the fixed stations are presented in Figure 28. Negative and positive values of NEC indicate net dissolution and precipitation of CaCO3 respectively and of NCP indicate net respiration and net photosynthesis respectively. Due to logistical difficulties at the atoll, this analysis could only be done for the shallow tide pools at the extremities of the Farol Island.\nThe NEC values range was from -18.76 to 39.7 mmol CaCO3 m-2 h-1 during the dry season and from -10.84 to 16.6 mmol CaCO3 m-2 h-1 during the wet season. Net dissolution was observed early in the morning during both season, and by the end of the afternoon only during the dry one. The NCP values range was from -49 to 100 mmol C m-2 h-1 during the dry season and -39.81 to 39.5 mmol C m-2 h-1 during the wet season. Net respiration was only observed early in the morning during the wet season, and at the end of the day for both seasons.\nHydrodynamics influence\nSince it was not possible to calculate the metabolic rates for all the sampling sites applying the slack water equations, it was used the correlation of the salinity-normalized TA (nTA) and DIC (nDIC) values to obtain the NEC:NCP ratios for the different group of sampling sites by season (Fig. 29). Overall from the ratios calculated in this study it was identified that the high organic production relative to the calcification indicates that the primary production exert a great control over the carbonate chemistry in the pools inside Rocas Atoll.\nDuring the dry season, it was observed significant correlations between nTA and nDIC for all the sampling groups of pools. The seawater samples collected at the close pools presented the higher ratio NEC:NCP, 0.30, followed by the shallow tide pools (fixed stations) near the main channels that connect the open ocean water to the lagoon inside Rocas Atoll, 0.18, and the pools connected to the open ocean, 0.15. During the wet season, the ratio NEC:NCP was not significant for the samples collected at the closed pools (0.03). For the samples from the fixed stations, the ratio was slightly bigger, 0.20 and for the open pools remained the same value of 0.15.\nFigure 108 - Net ecosystem calcification (NEC, mmol CaCO3 m2 h-1) and net community production (NCP, mmol C m2 h-1) of the fixed stations by time of the day and season (dry in blue; wet in red, and theirs smooth lines represent the mean values during the respective season. Positive and negative values are separated by the reference line.\nFigure 29 - Total alkalinity versus dissolved inorganic carbon diagram by groups of sampling sites and season. TA and DIC data where normalized to a salinity 36 (nTA and nDIC, respectively) by multiplying the TA and DIC data by the ratio of 36 to the measured in situ salinity. Symbols and regression line in blue represent the samples from the closed pools, in red the ones from the fixed station near the channels and in green, the ones from the pools connected to the open ocean.\n7.1.6.\tDISCUSSION\nDynamics of seawater carbonate chemistry\nThe huge variability of the physical and chemical parameters collected inside the tidal pools at Rocas Atoll demonstrate the ability of their organisms\u2019 metabolism to radically alter open superficial seawater characteristics. Data collected at an oceanographic campaign in 2012, in the surface open ocean around Rocas Atoll, obtained values of 8.13 to 8.21 pH, 2380 gmol kg-W TA, 2059 gmol kg-W DIC, 3.63 Q ar and 422 gatm pCO2., with are in accordance with the expected values for this region following the models of TAKAHASHI et al., (2014). The mean values obtained for the pools inside the atoll on this study were 8.35 \u00b1 0.17 pH, 2339 \u00b1 77 gmol kg-W TA, 1762 \u00b1 186 gmol kg-W DIC, 6.29 \u00b1 1.47 Qat and 172\u00b1 95 gatm pCO2, showing that the biogeochemical variations may arise from its organisms\u2019 metabolism, as also related for Indo-Pacific Atolls (SUSUKI; KAWAHATA, 2003; SILVERMAN et al., 2012). One evidence of the biological influence on the seawater carbonate chemistry of Rocas Atoll is due to the similar daily variation between pH and DO mirrored with the variations of pCO2 and DIC (Fig. 26). Diel cycles in coral reef CO2 system are largely driven by rates of primary production (ALBRIGHT et al., 2015). It is observed DIC decreasing and pH increasing along the day, while photosynthesis are taking place, and at night, these patterns inverts due to the dominance of respiratory processes (ANTHONY et al. 2011; KLEYPAS et al. 2011; SHAW et al. 2012). Our results showed large variations on some of those parameters along the day, among seasons and sampling sites. The higher ranges were observed at fixed stations in the extremities of Farol Islands, near the main channels that transport the open ocean waters to the lagoon inside the atoll and vice-versa, followed by the pools connected with the open ocean. The closed pools presented the more stable results.\nThe interactions involving tides, daily solar cycle, and the water volume at the shallow tide pools were the cause for the large temperature variation found at the fixed stations. The Q Ar values we calculated for these shallow tide pools ranged from 2.92 to 10.13, which are larger than the variability found in previous studies of CO2 system for a reef environment (SHAW et al., 2012, SILVERMAN et al., 2012). Rocas Atoll differs from other reefs situated in the Caribbean Sea and Indo-Pacific Ocean because it is mainly composed of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and does not present evidence of the joint activity of coralline algae and corals as constructors of the reef (KIKUCHI; LE\u00c3O, 1997; GHERARDI; BOSENCE, 2001). On this\nreef, the coralline alga Porolithon cf. pachydermum is a dominant organism and the primary reef constructor, being the basis for the development of secondary constructors such as vermetid gastropods and encrusting foraminifera, mainly Homotrema rubrum (VILLAS B\u00d4AS et al.,\n2005). According to ALBRIGHT et al. (2013), dissolution in supersaturated waters has been reported previously in other reef systems and is believed to be the result of under saturation in pore waters, bio erosion of sediments by endolithic microbes and boring forams, and/or dissolution of more soluble forms of calcium carbonate (e.g., high -Mg calcite). Since approximately 70% of the reef framework at Rocas are constructed by CCA (KIKUCHI; LE\u00c3O, 1997), that are rich in high Mg- calcite, the most soluble form of calcium carbonate, we believe that the dissolution of fragments of CCA and particles of sediment could be one of the causes for this huge availability of carbonate in the water column and therefore in the values of \u25a1at we observed.\nBesides the large diurnal variation, our results also show a seasonal variation of the parameters. According to SHAW and MCNEIL (2014), lower latitude regions with depleted nutrient levels have seasonal pCO2 variability driven by temperature effects where the pCO2 maximum occurs in summer. When summertime pCO2 are above the concentration of the atmosphere, the water act as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere, whereas during the winter the low concentration on the water may cause them to act as a sink. For the Rocas Atoll we observed the higher pCO2 average and the lowest temperatures during the dry season (Table 4), but in both seasons, the pCO2 average was lower than the concentration at the atmosphere resulting in a local characteristic of sink of CO2 all year around.\nCalcification and photosynthesis in Rocas Atoll\nConcerning the metabolic rates we calculated for the fixed stations, we found a huge variation along the day. The NEC averaged 6.5\u00b113 mmol CaCO3 m-2 h-1 during the dry season and 2.9 \u00b1 8 mmol CaCO3 m-2 h-1 during the wet one. However, when transformed those averages to daily rates, the production was 156 mmol (15.6g) CaCO3 m-2 d-1 in dry season and 69.6 mmol (6.96g) CaCO3 m-2 d-1 during the wet one, with an annual calcification rate of 4.1kg CaCO3 m2 y-1 (assuming 0.5yr for each net rate). This rate is similar to the ones reported for coral reef flat environments in Indo-Pacific (ALBRIGHT et al., 2013).\nIn our study, NEC was significant correlated with pH and concentration of CO2 at both seasons, with highlights the potential impact of ocean acidification over the calcification rates\non reefs ecosystems as point out in several studies (KLEYPAS et al., 1999 a, b; HOEGH-GULDBERG et al., 2007; ANDERSSON et al., 2013; KROEKER et al., 2013). Nonetheless, as observed by CHALLENER et al. (2015) for a shallow seagrass- dominated ecosystem in Florida, it is important to point out that the wide variation on the seawater carbonate are essential aspects to consider in the design of OA experiments concerning reef environments. Those authors argue that maintaining static pH and pCO2 values over the course of an experiment will not reflect natural conditions, once the usual fluctuation may serve as critical periods of organismal recovery from hypercapnic conditions. Therefore, it is recommended special attention to the pH and pCO2 natural variation when choosing the experimental design of studies addressing the question of the OA influence over the building organisms of Rocas Atoll. The calculated NCP was higher during the dry season at the fixed stations, and showed a huge range along the day. The mean values for this period was 29.7 \u00b1 34 mmol C m2 h-1 and 2 \u00b125 mmol C m-2 h-1 for the wet one. However, when we evaluate the ratio NCP:NEC according to the sampling groups and season it wasn\u2019t found significant difference between the seasons for the fixed station and open pools. Nonetheless, it is important to point out that for the closed pools the productivity was higher during the wet season with is in agreement with the higher mean DO values we found for this period.\nBased on the ratios of NEC:NCP we observed that the organic production (via photosynthesis) relative to calcification indicates that NCP is the primary controlling influence on carbonate chemistry in the pools inside the Rocas Atoll. Studies realized in reef ecosystems at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia also shown this pattern (ALBRIGHT et al. 2013; 2015). It is suggested that the biogeochemical processes happening there play an important role, modulating and interfering on the CO2 system, as described by THOMPSON et al. (2014), possible due to the potential pH buffering effect of elevated TA and [COf-], which could mitigate some of the effects of OA. In addition, our pCO2 estimations and our high NCP indicate that Rocas Atoll might serve as a sink, not a source, for atmospheric CO2, as also observed for reefs in Japan (KAYANNE et al., 1995).\n7.1.7.\tCONCLUSION\nThis study was the first to characterize the carbonate system for the biological reserve of Rocas Atoll, constituting an initial database to evaluate the effects of increased pCO2 in the atmosphere, on the chemical characteristics that influence the metabolism of calcifying\norganisms found at the atoll. The variation of the evaluated parameters is influenced by two biogeochemical processes, the organic and inorganic carbon metabolism. Photosynthesis and respiration were the primary controlling influence for the seawater carbonate chemistry variations of the pools inside the atoll. Our results also indicate a large availability of CaCO3 for calcifying organisms, which are currently undergoing aragonite saturation state values within the range consistent with their metabolic needs. And not only that, the values that we found in this study where elevated compered to others found in reef ecosystems, and suggest that the intense biological activity could mitigate some of the effects of OA and also function as a small local additional sink for anthropogenic CO2.\nManuscrito 4- Different physiological responses to warming and acidification may increase the potential of phase shifts between hard corals and zoanthids (Cnidaria: Anthozoa).

The majority of the investigations have been focused on effects of reef- building corals and the transition from hard corals to non-calcifying macroalgae communities. Here we report the effects of OA and thermal stress over physiological characteristics of a hard coral and a zoanthid. Porites astreoides showed impacts on the growth rate, photosynthesis, respiration, chlorophyll a concentration and total lipid content, while little or no effect was observed for Palythoa caribaeorum. These results suggest that reef communities in the Tropical Atlantic regions may shift from calcifying to a non- calcifying cnidarians under predicted changes on the oceanographic conditions.\n8.1.2.\tResumo\nSabe-se que o aumento das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es do CO2 antropog\u00eanico tem contribu\u00eddo para problemas atuais como o aquecimento global e a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica.

Nowadays, records monitored by the SCRIPS/ UCSD observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii are above 400 patm, and the year 2015 hit record high average, 400.88p.atm. One of the most alarming effects of this CO2 elevation in the atmosphere is the increase of global average temperature, that over the last thirty years has being raised by 0.2\u00b0C per decade (HANSEN et al., 2006). The oceans have been absorbing much of that heat such that the frequency and intensity of extreme thermal stress events have increased dramatically. According to MUMBY and VAN WOESIK (2014), in the 1980s and 1990s, El Ni\u00f1o events were associated with some of the most detrimental thermal stress events on coral reefs. Most recently, however, thermal stress events independent of El Nino have been witnessed, due to elevated background temperatures being forced higher by global warming.\nThe \u201cother CO2 problem\u201d rises from the fact that approximately one-quarter of the anthropogenic CO2 released into the atmosphere each year is absorbed by the global oceans. This excess CO2, throughout a series of chemical reactions, causes a process known as ocean acidification (OA), that represents measurable declines in surface ocean pH, carbonate ion concentration ([COf-]) and saturation state of carbonate minerals (\u25a1) (DONEY et al., 2009). OA represents a threat to marine species worldwide, and predicting the ecological impacts of acidification is a high priority for science, management, and policy (KROEKER et al., 2013). According to HOEGH-GULDBERG et al. (2007), reef ecosystems are among one of the most threatened environments. Impacts of OA on the marine calcifiers (organisms that depend on the carbonate ions available on the seawater to build their skeletons, shells, etc.) are constantly being reported around the world, affecting physiological processes such as growth, calcification and photosynthesis (DUPONT et al., 2010; ALBRIGHT; LANGDON, 2011; FABRICIUS et al., 2011; MELZNER et al., 2011). Those changes in the physiology of individuals can alter the dynamics of their populations and ultimately affect entire ecosystems (IGLESIAS-RODRIGUEZ et al., 2016).\nAs climate change alters oceanographic conditions, the geographic range of ocean habitat suitable for the growth of coral reef ecosystems is shifting. Corals of the order Scleractinia provide the foundation of shallow-water coral reef ecosystems. Scleractinian corals secrete calcium carbonate skeletons, which accumulate as reef structures that in turn support\nhighly biodiverse communities (FREEMAN et al., 2013). According to MUMBY and VAN WOESIK (2014), who review a series of impacts on coral reef systems with the warming and acidification of the oceans corals, calcified algae, urchins and reef fish may decline in the future, whereas algal turfs, non-calcifying macrophytas and non-calcifying zooxanthellate cnidarians should benefit from elevated dissolved inorganic carbon. ALBRIGHT et al. (2016) run an insitu experiment, manipulating the carbonate chemistry of a reef in Australia and concluded that the present day conditions may already be impairing coral growth.\nPhase shifts on coral reefs are characterized by a decrease in abundance or coverage of corals, followed by a persistent increase in non-reef builders such as algae and soft corals. The consequence of this phenomenon is the loss of reef-building capacity, which is responsible for maintaining the structure of the reef and its structural complexity, therefore, the reef loses the capacity to maintain its local diversity (CRUZ et al. 2015a, and references therein). Nonetheless, predictions about the ecological consequences of oceanic uptake of CO2 are particularly focused on calcifying organisms that play critical roles in the formation of habitats or their maintenance (CONNELL; RUSSELL, 2010). According to CRUZ et al. (2015a), most of the studies predicting phase shift scenarios on reefs due to the impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic effects address the change from a coral-dominated community to an algal-dominated community. This focus overlooks the direct effects of ocean warming and acidification on non-calcareous taxa, particularly those that play critical roles in ecosystem shifts.\nUnderstanding how CO2-enhanced productivity of non- and less- calcifying anthozoans applies more widely to tropical ecosystems is a priority where such organisms can dominate benthic ecosystems, in particular following localized anthropogenic stress (SUGGETT et al., 2012). In fact, a phase shift from a coral dominated to a zoanthid (Palythoa cf. variabilis, initially identified as Epizoanthus gabrieli) dominated reef have been reported (CRUZ et al., 2015a, 2016) and this also effects the reef fish communities (CRUZ et al., 2015b). Palythoa caribaeorum Duchassaing and Michelotti, 1860 is considered a strong competitor when interacting with other organisms for space on the reef (BASTIDAS; BONE, 1996, RABELO et al., 2013). Brazilian coastal reefs, for instance, are covered mainly by zoanthids, and the dominant species is P. caribaeorum, which is common in the western Atlantic (ACOSTA; GONZALES, 2007; SILVA et al., 2015). Therefore, investigation of physiological impacts of\nOA and warming on this organism, would contribute to the predictions of phase-shift scenarios from hard to soft-bodies cnidarians in the reefs of the future.\nThe present study measured the growth, photosynthesis, respiration, total lipid content and chlorophyll a concentration of a calcifying and a non- calcifying cnidarian over thermal and acidification stresses. We compared these physiological responses among the organisms that were pre-conditioned to high and low pCO2 treatments on ambient temperature (27\u00b0C) during the first phase with the effects of the pCO2 treatments and warming (31.5\u00b0C) at the second part of the research. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cnidarians metabolic differences when submitted to the same stress condition, shedding light on the important question in the field of eco-physiology and conservational science, of which will be the \u201cwinner\u201d and \u201closer\u201d organisms on the reefs of the future.\n8.1.4.\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCollection and experimental design\nColonies of the scleractinian coral Porites astreoides Lamarck, 1816 (3) and the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum (4) were collected off Miami Beach (25.84716\u00b0N; 80.10425\u00b0W), by Scuba divers with hammer and chisel, from aproximately 5m depth and transported in coolers back to the University of Miami (UM). Cores were removed from the parental coral colonies using a handheld drill fitted with a 7.85 cm2 round diamond tipped coring bit. Zoanthid colonies were cut in pieces of 17.1 \u00b13.21 cm2with sterilized razors, and placed in tanks under control conditions (27 \u00b0C, pCO2 400patm) to recover for two weeks prior to the beginning of the experiment. During this process, some zoanthid pieces showed tissue necrosis and were subsequently removed from the tanks, treated with lugol, and allowed to recover in separete tanks with the same conditions. The pieces that showed more of 50% necrosis were replaced by new pieces. The research was realized in the summer of 2015, at the South Florida Corals and Climate Change laboratory at the UM Rosenstiel School's Experimental Hatchery. For detail description of the aquaria set-up, see TOWLE et al. (2015a).\nThe study consisted of two phases: the first one (P1) with high (~900 patm) and low (~400 patm) pCO2 treatments at 27\u00b0C, (from July 15th to August 14th) and the second phase (P2, from August 14th to September 11th) also with high and low pCO2 treatments but the temperature was set at 31.5\u00b0C, to evaluate the impact of warming on pre-aclimated CO2\nconditions. Each treatment was replicated twice. In total, 72 cores/pieces of each organism were analyzed. All pieces were distributed among the tanks in the beginning of the first phase (18 cores/pieces per tank). By the end of this phase half of them were collected and frozen (-80\u00b0C) for posterior analyses. For the second phase only 9 cores/pieces of organisms were kept in the treatment tanks until the end of the experiment, then also frozen for analyzes. The organisms were fed twice a week with powdered zooplankton.\nSeawater chemistry\nTwo to three times a week, around 12pm, temperature and salinity were measured by a handheld salinity, condutivity and temperature system (YSI model 30) and discrete water samples were taken from each tank and poisoned with mercuric chloride to be analyzed for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA). DIC was measured using a DIC Analyzer (Apollo Sci-Tech Inc.) and TA mesured on an automated Gran titrator (developed by C. Langdon) and standardized using certified reference material from Dr. A. Dickson (Scripps IO). The mean temperature, salinity, TA and DIC were used to calculate pCO2, pH and aragonite saturation state (Qar) for each treatment using the CO2Sys Excel Macro (PIERROT et al., 2006). The carbonic acid dissociation constants from MEHRBACK et al. (1973) refitted by DICKSON and MILLERO (1987) were adopted , as well as the bisulfate ion dissociation constant described by DICKSON (1990).\nPhysiological measurments\nFour days prior to the end of each phase photosynthesis and respiration were measured on 9 cores/pieces of each organism taken randomly from all the tanks. Corals were incubated in 225 mL chambers, and zoanhids in 485 mL chambers at the Hatchery and transported to Dr. Chris Langdon's Lab across the street where a temperature controlled water bath was set-up. The incubation was continuously stirred with a magnetic coupled stirring bar for about one hour and the artificial light provided by a lamp was about 300 pmol photons m-2 s\u20191. The difference between the photosynthesis (P) batch and the respiration (R) was that the chambers were carefully wrapped in aluminum foil during the tests. Therefore the respiration rate was obtained from the measurement of net photosynthesis in the dark. Duplicate samples from seawater were taken from the tanks just prior the organisms being trapped in the chambers and fixed for posterior analyzis. Duplicate chambers containing only seawater were used as blanks and recieved the same procedure as the chambers containing organisms. After the incubation period,\nseawater samples were collected and fixed for dissolved oxygen (DO) analyzis. DO (gM) was measured using an automated titrator following the Winkler methodology as described in STRICKLAND and PARSONS (1972). P and R rates were estimated by the production or consumption of oxygen and normalized by the volume of the chamber, organisms\u2019 surface area and time of incubation. The gross photosynthesis (GP, total oxygen production) rates represent the photosynthetic activity of the endo-symbiotic algae, and are achieved independently of the host respiration measurements (GP=P+R). Initial O2 concentrations in each experiment and treatment were close to 200mmol.kg-1 (the expected saturation concentration at 26\u00b0C and 35ppt), and absolute O2 concentrations never fell below 160 mmol.kg-1, 80% of saturation (2mg.L-1 or ~60 mmol.kg-1 is typically identified as physiologically stressful by the EPA and NOAA).\nFor the analysis of lipid content and chlorophyll a (chl.a) concentrations, the organisms collected by the end of each phase were unfrozen and the coral tissue was completely removed from the skeleton using an air- pick and filtered seawater (0.45gm), then homogenized. For the zoanthids, an area of 2.25cm2 was cut in the center of each piece, ground with filtered seawater, then homogenized. The volume of the total blastate was recorded for each core or piece of organism. An aliquot of 5 mL (for lipids) and another of 2 mL (for chlorophyll a) were filtered onto GF/A filters and frozen at -80\u00b0C until further analysis. Total lipid mass was analyzed according TEECE et al. (2011) and chl. a following HOLM-HANSEN and RIERMANN (1978), both briefly described in TOWLE et al. (2015b). Those data were normalized by the organisms\u2019 surface area. For corals the surface area was estimated by the aluminum foil density method (MARSH, 1970 described in VEAL et al., 2010), and the pieces of zoanthids were photographed to have their surface area measured using the ImageJ software. The growth rate (cm2. d-1) was estimated by the difference between the surface area at the beginning and at the end of each phase divided by the correspondent number of days.\nData Analysis\nThe response of the following physiological variables was tested with a oneway ANOVA: growth, photosyntesis, respiration, lipids and chlorophyll a, with the phase as fixed factor and by CO2 treatment (high and low) and organism (coral and zoanthid). A significance level of 0.05 was adopted. Prior to running any analysis, the data were checked for normality and homoscedasticity with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Bartlett's tests, respectively. To explore\npotential relationships between the physiological measurements and the carbonate chemistry of the seawater during the study we conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). All statistical analyses were performed in the program JMP\u00ae10.0.2.\n8.1.5.\tRESULTS\nA significant difference (p>0.05) was observed in the carbonate chemistry parameters among the study phases (Table 5). However, high and low treatments were considered independently at each phase, where during P1, the pCO2 treatment was characterized by high= 985\u00b1 211 qatm and low= 438\u00b1 42.8 qatm; and during P2: high= 1096\u00b1 208 and low= 517\u00b1\n82.3\tqatm. Therefore, during the first phase, the impact of the high and low pCO2 treatment at 27\u00b0C on the physiological parameters was evaluated, while during the second phase, the effect of warming (31.5\u00b0C ) and more acidified waters was investigated.\nTable 5.

For P. astreoides the average growth during P1 was 0.187 \u00b10.088 and 0.093 \u00b10.059 cm2. d-1 during P2. The coral cores showed a faster growth rate on the low pCO2 treatment during the second phase (ANOVA, F= 6.79, p=0.0131). P. caribaeorum showed a reduction in the mean surface area during P1, while the second phase mean growth rate was 0.1\u00b10.06 cm2. d-1 (Fig. 29-I). The organisms show different intensity of their metabolic rates (ANOVA, F= 98.781, p<0.0001 for GP and F= 302.655, p<0.0001 for R and F= 6.438, p= 0.0125 for GP: R ratio). Coral cores revealed higher metabolic rates then zoanthid pieces in the course of the incubations (Fig. 29, II-IV). P. astreoides GP rates were higher in P2 (33\u00b110 nmol\nO2. mL-1. cm2. h-1) than during P1 (22.7\u00b17.41nmol O2. mL-1. cm2. h-1). Over the first phase P. astreoides showed higher GP rates at the low pCO2 treatment (ANOVA, F= 6.218, p=0.0220), while P. caribaeorum at the high treatment (ANOVA, F= 6.239, p=0.0195, Fig. 29, II). The mean oxygen consumption was also higher throughout the second phase for P. astreoides. However, higher rate of oxygen consumption in the high pCO2 treatment during P1 was observed (ANOVA, F= 5.99, p=0.0191).\nThe average respiration rates were -7.5\u00b12.12 and -9.87 \u00b11.73 nmol O2. mL-1. cm2. h-1 during P1 and P2, respectively, for the coral cores, while the zoanthid pieces were -2.3\u00b10.54 and -2.2\u00b10.81 nmol O2. mL-1. cm2. h-1 in P1 and P2, respectively (Fig. 29, III). The mean GP: R ratio for P. astreoides was 3.4\u00b10.92 while for P. caribaeorum was 2.9\u00b11.07. A significant difference in the GP:R ratio of P. astreoides in the low pCO2 treatment (3.81\u00b10.38) during the second phase was observed (Fig 29. IV).\nChlorophyll a concentration and total lipid content also vary among the organism (ANOVA, F= 381.001, p<0.0001 for Chl. a and F= 302.655, p<0.0001 for lipids), however, for those parameters, P. caribaeorum presented the higher means. The only significant variation on the Chl. a concentration was among phases (ANOVA, F= 4.468, p=0.0363). P. astreoides showed an elevated concentration during the second phase (1.03\u00b10.57 qg. cm-2) compared to 0.73\u00b10.23 qg. cm-2 recorded during P1 (Fig. 30, I). However, an inverse behavior was observed for the total lipid content. The mean P. astreoides' content was higher in P1 (5.67\u00b12.06 mg.cm-2), and decreased to 3.9\u00b10.72 mg.cm-2, during P2 (Fig. 30, II). P. caribaeorum showed elevated lipid content during the second phase at the low pCO2 treatment (ANOVA, F= 15.37, p=0.0007).\nThe interactions between seawater physical and chemical parameters and physiological factors were further investigated with PCA. Those analyzes revealed that two sets of components explained 61.9% for P. astreoides (Fig. 31a) and 58.4% for P. caribaeorum (Fig. 31b) of the variances observed during this study. When submitted to different temperature and pCO2 conditions the results for the coral species showed that total growth and respiration rates increased with low temperature and low pCO2 concentrations. Both, total lipid and Chl. a concentration were influenced by of the temperature, Chl. a had a positive correlation, and lipids decreased at high temperatures. Gross photosynthesis rates were positively correlated with temperature and negatively with salinity.\nRespiration rate (nmol 02. mL-1.cm-2.h-1)\nFigure 11 - P. astreoides (light gray) and P. caribaeorum (dark gray) physiological responses over the different phases (P1- 27\u00b0C; P2 -31.5\u00b0C) and pCO2 treatments (High and Low).

Error bars represent the standard deviation. Different letters represent significant variation of the means between the organisms and phase, while asterisk indicate difference among the pCO2 treatments within each phase (ANOVA, p<0.05).\nIt was also observed that a small, but positive influence of the CO2 treatment on the GP rates had occurred (Fig. 29 II). P. caribaeorum results reveal that chlorophyll a and GP rates had little or almost no correlation with abiotic parameters. Respiration rates and total lipid contents\nChlorophyll a (uj/cm7)\nwere more influenced by the CO2 treatments such that, respiration showed a small but positive correlation with pCO2 and DIC, while lipids showed positive correlation with pH and salinity.\nThe growth rate seems to be only influenced by temperature.\nFigure 30 - P. astreoides (light gray) and P. caribaeorum (dark gray) chlorophyll a concentration (I- pg. cm'2) and total lipid content (II- mg. cm'2) over the different phases (P1- 27\u00b0C; P2 -31.5\u00b0C) and pCO2 treatments (High and Low).

P. astreoides, a calcifying scleractinian coral showed clear impact of warming and acidification on its metabolism, while little effect was observed in P. caribaeorum, a non-calcifying zoanthid. The influence of increase temperature and/or pCO2 on P. astreoides is well documented. Impacts on multiple early life history processes were reported, such as larval availability (gamete production, fertilization, etc.), larval settlement, post settlement growth, metabolism and survival (ALBRIGHT et al., 2008, ALBRIGHT; LANGDON, 2011). Also impacts on, respiration and photo-physiology (EDMUNDS, 2012) calcification and extension rates (COOK et al., 2013, VENTI et al., 2014, MANZELLO et al., 2015) on adult colonies, concluded that this species can be or already is affected by global change impacts in the oceans. Nevertheless, for P. caribaeorum only one study reported impacts of OA and warming on the association zoanthid/symbiont, providing evidence that P. caribaeorum -Symbiodinium spp. are more likely to prevail in warm and acidified oceans (GRAHAM and SANDERS, 2016). In fact, there is only a few studies reporting those effects on non-calcifying cnidarians. SUGGETT et al., (2012) examined an increased growth of sea anemone population along a natural CO2 gradient at Vulcano, Italy; TOWANDA and THUESEN (2012) observed growth of the algal symbionts in intertidal sea anemones under elevated CO2 conditions and INOUE et al. (2013) reported a dominance of a soft coral in acidified zones in natural CO2 seep in Japan.\nThe P. astreoides growth reported here was influenced by temperature, with a decrease of 50.3% on the growth rate from the first (27\u00b0C) to the second phase (31,5\u00b0C), which is in accordance with the findings by MANZELLO et al., (2015) that showed heat stress negatively correlates with calcification of P. astreoides. Elevated pCO2 conditions also affected the P. astreoides growth. The influence of acidified conditions on the coral growth was observed during the second phase, higher growth rates on the low pCO2 treatment were observed. Moreover, a trend toward lower growth rate for the P. astreoides under high CO2 conditions in the first phase was witnessed. Although this different was not significant, it is believed that if we had evaluated the calcification rate, we could also find the effect of the pCO2 treatment on the first phase. CROOK et al., (2013) also did not find significant differences on the linear extension rates (cm.y-1) for the P. astreoides in undersaturated waters (Qarag&lt;1) compared to ambient conditions (Qarag > 3.5), but they reported a significant decline in the annual\ncalcification rates. They predicted a decline of 30% in calcification from ambient conditions by the time Qarag=2 and up to 66% comparing ambient to Qarag&lt;1. They attributed this decrease in calcification to a decrease in skeletal density with decreasing Qarag. Therefore, it is likely that CO2 conditions would be also influence the calcification of P. asteroides in the first phase of the study if we had measured this parameter.\nAs for P. caribaeorum, the decrease in the growth rate observed during the first phase of the study seems to have been more influenced by the slower healing process of the fragmentation two weeks prior the beginning of the experimental phase, than the impact of the stress conditions. During the second phase, the zoanthids started to grow even though, the mean rate observed for low CO2 conditions on this phase (0.132 \u00b10.79 cm2. d-1), was slower than reported for natural conditions (0.36 cm2. d-1, RABELO et al., 2013). We observed a small tendency of impact on the growth on the high CO2 treatment; however, further studies are necessary to draw conclusions about the effect of increased CO2 conditions on the growth rate of P. caribaeorum.\nIt was determined that there were significantly higher means of gross photosynthesis, respiration and chl. a for the P. astreoides cores with the increase of temperature during the second phase. Those metabolic results are related to the zooxanthellae production and it is well known that the host-symbiont association is affected by temperature and may cause expulsion of the symbionts causing bleaching (NAKAMURA et al., 2004). It has been shown that corals undergo vast physiological changes before bleaching occurs. The loss of zooxanthellae at high temperatures was suggested to be a final strategy to defend corals from oxidative stress, once the heat stress leads to production of active O2 by the photosynthesis, which subsequently causes cellular damage and expulsion of the symbiont (AL HORANI, 2005). Therefore, the increase in those metabolic rates has a maximum temperature tolerance. If the heat stress is too intense, or lasts for long periods, the corals lose their symbionts, and there is a decrease in their metabolism (HOEGH-GULDBERG, 1999). FUJIMURA et al. (2008) and HENNIGE et al., (2010), also reported similar results of the rising temperature effects on the coral metabolic rates. According to MANZELLO et al., (2007) the bleaching threshold for corals on the Florida Keys is 30.4\u00b0C. During the present study, the temperature in the second phase was setup at 31.5\u00b0C, however, only few coral cores were observed became pail (4) or bleached (2) (PINHEIRO, pers. obs).\nIt would be expected that, as a zooxanthellate anthozoan like P. astreoides, respecting the degree of inter and intra specific variation, P. caribaeorum presented the same variations, however GRAHAM and SANDER (2016), demonstrated that the response of symbiotic cnidarians to thermal stress and OA must be considered on a host-specific and symbiont-specific basis. It was shown that warming did not affect carbon fixation or fixed carbon translocation in the Zoanthus sp./A4 association, and high pCO2 increased carbon fixation. In contrast, both thermal stress and high pCO2 inhibited carbon fixation in the Palythoa sp./C1 association. However, carbon fixation increased in C1 symbionts when maintained at combined high temperature (31 \u00b0C) and pH 7.65 (GRAHAM; SANDER, 2016). According to KEMP et al. (2006) P. caribaeorum from south Florida reefs harbored two genetic types of zooxanthellae, C1 and D1a and individual colonies may contain populations of only C1 or D1a, or combinations of C1 and D1a. In the present study P. caribaeorum did not show significant effect on respiration and chl.a concentrations, but during the first phase an increase of 17.37% in the GP ratios on low pCO2 treatment was detected (Fig. 32, II). However, when evaluating the GP:R ratios the impact of acidified conditions on this species association was not detected. It is suggested that P. caribaeorum could have a high tolerance for internal hypercapnic conditions, as observed for other non-calcifying alga- invertebrate symbioses (HALLSPENCER et al., 2008; TOWANDA; THUESEN, 2012), but further investigation is needed in order to test this hypothesis.\nAn influence of pCO2 levels on the total lipid contents of P. astreoides was not detected however, with the increase of temperature in the second phase, a mean reduction of 31.22% was observed. This result is in accordance with TOWLE et al. (2015b), which studied in-situ metabolic rates of P. astreoides in the Florida Reef Tract, and reported that lipid content was significantly affected by season; with a decrease on the P. astreoides lipid content and elevated mean sea surface temperatures during summer. Moreover, partial or complete loss of zooxanthellae by the coral host is accompanied by significant variations in total lipid content and lipid class proportions in coral colonies (IMBS, 2014). TEECE et al. (2011) showed that zooxanthellae are the dominant source of fatty acids for corals, however, P. astreoides could exhibit great plasticity in their ability to switch from autotrophic to heterotrophic nutritional inputs. Here, both, coral and zoanthid, received the same food regime, being feed twice weekly with powdered zooplankton. It has been shown that vulnerability of corals to disturbance can be influenced by their energetic status, and lipid reserved stored by corals may allow them to\nincrease their resilience and resistance to stress (TEECE at al., 2011; TOWLE, et al., 2015a). In the present study the total lipid content for P. astreoides ranged from 3.68 to 6.21 mg. cm-2 while the in situ values reported in TOWLE et al. (2015b) were 2.3 to 3.5 mg. cm2 Although those concentrations could be indicative of enough energy stored to keep up with the OA effects, still, temperature showed to have influence in the total lipid content in P. astreoides.\nAn influence of the pCO2 treatment on total lipid contents for P. caribaeorum was not detected during the first phase. However, the combined effect of elevated temperature and the prolonged pCO2 conditions caused a reduction in the total lipid contents on the zoanthids submitted to a higher acidified stress. Based on current knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of warming and OA on total lipid contents on zoanthids. There are three studies on the lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition of Palythoa spp. The first, by MIRALLES et al. (1989), reported the FA composition of five Senegalese Palythoa spp.; followed by a study of FA composition of total lipids and major phospholipids of P. caribaeorum from Puerto Rico (CARBALLEIRA; REYES, 1995) and most recently a study about lipid class and FA composition of Palythoa caesia from the South China Sea (IMBS, 2014). Investigations of P. caesia uncovered the peculiarities of lipid classes and FA composition that distinguish zoanthids from reef-building and soft corals. According to IMBS (2014), P. caesia contained significantly more structural lipids (polar lipids and steroids) and less reserve lipids (triglycerides) than reef building corals. Many answers remains unknown, partly because the total lipid content can come either from the host itself or from other associated organisms. Therefore, additional studies are necessary to determine the actual impact of warming and OA on P. caribaeorum lipid content.\nHowever, results of the principal component analyses for both organisms studied here indicated that the physiological aspects of the zoanthid had less or no impact to warming and OA when compared to the reef building coral. Therefore, if raising atmospheric CO2 and its consequences do not have a negative effect on its metabolism, it would be expected that P. caribaeorum could enhance its abilities as a voracious competitor on the reef. Future studies should aim to determine the impact of thermal and acidification stress on different zoanthid genotype metabolisms or on the production of P. caribaeorum mucus (that protects the organism from desiccation and has powerful toxins against predators). Additional future studies should aim to identify how (or if) those organisms will adapt (or not) to upcoming oceanographic conditions predicted for the end of the century. So far, there have been reported\nphase- shifts from corals to soft- corals in high CO2 zones in Japan (INOUE et al., 2013) and an increased growth of sea anemone papulation along a natural CO2 gradient in Italy (SUGGETT et al., 2012). CRUZ et al. (2015a) reported a shift from a coral to a zoanthid dominant reef in Brazil, but they argue that the loss of coral cover may be a result of local anthropogenic disturbances. However, given the large number of human impacts, the specific causes of this shift was not conclusive. This study suggests that warming and ocean acidification could induce shifts from hard coral- to zoanthid-dominated communities in the Tropical Atlantic regions.\n9. CONSIDERA\u00c7\u00d5ES FINAIS\nOs organismos construtores do atol est\u00e3o sob influ\u00eancia dos efeitos da crescente concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2 atmosf\u00e9rico. Essas mudan\u00e7as podem causar altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos padr\u00f5es de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, din\u00e2mica populacional e equil\u00edbrio do ecossistema recifal do Atol das Rocas. Os par\u00e2metros abi\u00f3ticos est\u00e3o relacionados com ciclo diurnos de mar\u00e9, insola\u00e7\u00e3o e volume de troca de \u00e1gua nas piscinas. O metabolismo dos organismos (fotoss\u00edntese, respira\u00e7\u00e3o, calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o, dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o, excre\u00e7\u00e3o e decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o) tamb\u00e9m influenciaram a disponibilidade espa\u00e7o-temporal dos nutrientes em um ambiente oligotr\u00f3fico. Foi observado que a disponibilidade de nutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos na \u00e1gua do mar pode contribuir para a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos organismos no atol, uma vez que locais com domin\u00e2ncia de macro e tufos de algas estiveram associadas com maiores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes dissolvidos. E al\u00e9m disso, ambientes com alta frequ\u00eancia de organismos carbon\u00e1ticos podem estar associados com uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de alcalinidade.\nBaseado nos dados de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, crescimento e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de frequ\u00eancia da popula\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie Siderastrea stellata, coral dominante nas piscinas do atol, foi observado que a popula\u00e7\u00e3o dessa esp\u00e9cie se mostra com um alto potencial de manuten\u00e7\u00e3o e recupera\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma vez que essa apresenta elevada taxa de crescimento e boa representatividade de col\u00f4nias adultas e jovens. Os dados apresentados devem contribuir com a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos que poder\u00e3o auxiliar na conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e manejo dessa popula\u00e7\u00e3o, al\u00e9m de uma melhor compreens\u00e3o sobre sua vulnerabilidade aos impactos das mudan\u00e7as globais. Os dados obtidos foram importantes para indicar que o ecossistema ainda se encontra em equil\u00edbrio, sendo de extrema import\u00e2ncia a continua\u00e7\u00e3o de estudos de longo prazo para identificar se o aumento do CO2 trar\u00e1 mudan\u00e7as individuais ou estruturais, sendo esta \u00faltima a mais prov\u00e1vel em consequ\u00eancia do desequil\u00edbrio ecol\u00f3gico que poder\u00e1 se instalar. Falhas no recrutamento e na reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o como observamos, precisam ser melhor avaliadas para se obter melhores conclus\u00f5es sobre os impactos na estrutura dessa comunidade. Estudos sobre dispers\u00e3o larval e taxas de fecundidade dos p\u00f3lipos podem elucidar quest\u00f5es sobre um poss\u00edvel efeito das mudan\u00e7as globais.\nEsse estudo foi o primeiro a caracterizar o sistema carbonato marinho para o Atol das Rocas. Os dados obtidos poder\u00e3o servir de base para avaliar os efeitos da eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do CO2\natmosf\u00e9rico sob as mudan\u00e7as previstas das caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas do oceano e as consequ\u00eancias na fisiologia dos organismos encontrados no atol. As varia\u00e7\u00f5es dos par\u00e2metros analisados foram relacionadas com os metabolismos org\u00e2nico e inorg\u00e2nico do carbono como a fotoss\u00edntese e respira\u00e7\u00e3o que foram os principais fatores que interferiram na varia\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema carbonato. Al\u00e9m disso, os nossos resultados indicam uma grande disponibilidade de carbonato dissolvido nas piscinas do atol. A calcifica\u00e7\u00e3o e a dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o influenciaram os \u00edndices de satura\u00e7\u00e3o de aragonita que n\u00e3o s\u00f3 suprem as necessidades metab\u00f3licas dos organismos, como est\u00e3o acima dos observados para outros ambientes recifais. Desta forma, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que a intensa atividade biol\u00f3gica no atol das rocas possa mitigar alguns dos efeitos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica.\nOs resultados dos experimentos com esp\u00e9cies de coral e zoant\u00eddeo que ocorrem no atol (Porites astreoides e Palythoa caribaeorum), coletadas no Sul da Florida, mostraram que a esp\u00e9cie de coral duro construtor de recife, sofreu influ\u00eancia do aquecimento e da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o em suas taxas metab\u00f3licas, enquanto o zoant\u00eddeo teve um menor, ou nenhum impacto no seu metabolismo causado pela acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o ou aquecimento. Portanto, se o aumento de CO2 na atmosfera e suas consequ\u00eancias n\u00e3o tem um efeito negativo sobre o seu metabolismo, seria de esperar que o P. caribaeorum poderia aumentar suas habilidades como um competidor voraz no recife. Estudos futuros devem determinar o impacto do estresse t\u00e9rmico e acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o metabolismo de outros gen\u00f3tipos de zoant\u00eddeo, principalmente Zoanthus sociatus, que \u00e9 a esp\u00e9cie em maior abundancia no plat\u00f4 recifal do Atol. Pois, os resultados apresentados aqui indicam que o aquecimento e a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos poderiam induzir mudan\u00e7as nas comunidades bent\u00f4nicas, de dominadas por coral duro para dominadas por zoant\u00eddeo nas regi\u00f5es do Atl\u00e2ntico Tropical.\nA Reserva Biol\u00f3gica do Atol das Rocas \u00e9 praticamente livre de impactos antr\u00f3picos tais como sobre-explota\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies marinhas, pesca destrutiva e polui\u00e7\u00e3o org\u00e2nica, mas, ainda assim, a sua localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e sua conserva\u00e7\u00e3o regida por rigorosa lei, n\u00e3o pode proteg\u00ea-la de impactos em escala global. Rocas est\u00e1 altamente vulner\u00e1vel aos impactos oriundos do aumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do CO2 atmosf\u00e9rico, uma vez que o aquecimento e acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos podem causar danos em esp\u00e9cies que utilizam o carbonato para construir seus esqueletos. Embora no atol ainda seja encontrada uma grande disponibilidade desse mineral, j\u00e1 existem estudos mostrando impacto devido ao estresse t\u00e9rmico. Al\u00e9m disso, o progn\u00f3stico da eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel do mar \u00e9 outra amea\u00e7a que poder\u00e1 provocar fortes mudan\u00e7as no atol, desde o\nREFER\u00caNCIAS\nABRIL, G. et al.
