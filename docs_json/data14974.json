Metal carbonate precipitation can be an effective way for its removal, as manganese\ncarbonate has been detected in net alkaline mine waters. However, limestone is effective in removing\nmanganese only if the metal content is low. This research sought to study manganese precipitation from\nhigh-manganese (140 mL) content mine waters applying sodium carbonate and limestone mixtures. It\nwas observed that besides the total carbonate concentration, pH plays a key role on manganese\ncarbonate formation. Provided the pH solution is above 8.5, 99.9% manganese removal can be achieved\nwith carbonate ions. Although not required for manganese precipitation, limestone acts as a solid\nsubstrate for the nucleation of fine manganese carbonate grains. Infrared spectroscopy showed\nmanganese carbonate precipitation on the limestone surface. Magnesium was also removed from the\nmine water but magnesium carbonate formation was not observed.\n\n? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nMining countries have abundant natural resources, which\npromotes economic growth and thus wealth (Abraham, 2006).\nHowever, mining and metallurgical processes have the potential to\nproduce long term environmental impacts as demonstrated by the\nMinamata Bay contamination with mercury and the Rio Tinto\nEstuary contamination with AMD (Franks et al., 2011).\n\nThe application of sustainable development concepts in the\nmining industry has long been welcomed because mining activities,\ndespite affecting relatively small areas, always have environmental\nimpacts including deforestation, vegetation removal, erosion, and\nlandscape alteration (Hilson, 2003). Potential sources of pollution\ninclude drainages, air emissions (including particulate matter) and\nspills (Driussi and Jansz, 2006). Cyanidation tailings, sulfur dioxide\nand acid mine drainage are among the most cited examples of\nenvironmental impacts of the mining sector (Hilson, 2000).\n\nSustainable development encompasses cleaner production (CP)\nand pollution prevention (P2) (Basu and van Zyl, 2006). Hilson\n(2000) argues that CP and P2 are different concepts, particularly\nin terms of scope. Whereas CP emphasizes change to a wide range\nof elements in environmental management, P2 is mainly used to\nx: \u00fe55 31 3559 1561.\n(A.M. Silva), versiane@\no).\n\nAll rights reserved.\ndescribe environmental improvements resulting from technolog-\nical changes. Conversely, Basu and van Zyl (2006) includes CP and\nP2 in the same umbrella of industrial ecology as a means to achieve\nsustainable development in a mining context.\n\nNotwithstanding, either CP or P2 will always be a challenge to\nthe mining industry (Hilson, 2003), which has a conservative\nperspective regarding new technologies. Economic barriers,\nderived from the commodity aspect of mine products, small R&amp;D\ndepartments, and the lack of top-level management commitment\nto CP are the reasons for such challenge (Moors et al., 2005). It has\nbeen proposed that the nature of the mining operations along with\nits unavoidable environmental impacts, make CP concepts difficult\nto be applied in the mining context (Hilson, 2003). Nevertheless, CP\nin mining can be divided into three different categories: (i) mana-\ngerial changes, (ii) policy changes and (iii) physical changes (Hilson,\n2003). The first group comprises performing operations with\nenvironmental efficiency, supported by environmental manage-\nment systems. The second is related to decision-making regarding\nmining activities, which is carried out through corporate environ-\nmental policies and audits. The third includes technological\nchanges and adoption of state-of-art processes and equipment\n(Hilson, 2003). Examples of such aspects include: sustainable\ndevelopment principles for the disposal of mining wastes (Franks\net al., 2011); new water management policies in mining compa-\nnies (Ringwood and Balfe, 2006); different technologies aiming at\nwaste minimization, treatment and disposal (Franks et al., 2011);\n\nmailto:adarlenems@gmail.com\nmailto:versiane@demet.em.ufop.br\nmailto:versiane@demet.em.ufop.br\nmailto:versiane.ufop@gmail.com\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09596526\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/jclepro\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.01.032\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.01.032\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.01.032\n\n\nA.M. Silva et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 29-30 (2012) 11e1912\nnew pyrometallurgical processes with improved sulfur and carbon\nsequestration (Moors et al., 2005); and substitution of hazardous\nchemicals (Grosse et al., 2003), among others.\n\nMany aspects of CP and P2 are related to mine waters, including\nboth water management and treatment. This is because the mineral\nindustry utilizes water for a plethora of activities, such as: pro-\ncessing and transport of ores and wastes; mineral beneficiation;\ndust suppression; washing; extractive metallurgy operations; and\nhuman consumption (Kemp et al., 2010). Therefore, water release\ninto the environment is a chief concern both for the industry and\nenvironmental agencies (Driussi and Jansz, 2006). Regulations\nthroughout the world define standards for water discharge that\nmust be met by the mining and other industries. These standards\ncan be very strict regarding toxic metals in mine waters.\n\nManganese is a toxic element usually found in the effluents of\nmany industries, as well as in mine waters, either neutral or acid\n(AMD). AMD is produced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals as\na result of exposure to both oxygen and water during the mining\nand processing of metal sulfides and coal (Sheoran et al., 2010).\nBesides manganese, the large content of other elements (mainly\niron, aluminum, sulfate and other dissolved materials during acid\nattack on the mining tailings) found in the AMD is also a concern.\nMost of these elements can be removed by just increasing drainage\npH, which is achieved usually by lime addition. Since metal solu-\nbility is reduced as pH increases, lime is able to reduce metal\nconcentrations and enables drainage compliance with environ-\nmental regulations. Metal sulfide precipitation is also applied to\nremove the transition metal elements, since the residual metal\nconcentrations are very low (Cao et al., 2009; Cohen, 2006).\nNevertheless, neither lime nor sulfide ions are effective in removing\nmanganese, as this element is soluble over a wide pH range and\nvery difficult to remove from contaminated waters; requiring pH\nabove 11 for an effective removal as hydroxide (Ellis et al., 2000).\n\nMn2\u00fe oxidation and precipitation as MnO2 followed by clarifi-\ncation is also an alternative to treat manganese-containing drain-\nages. Chemical oxidation can be performed by aeration or applying\nstrong oxidizing agents, such as potassium permanganate, hypo-\nchlorite or ozone (Silva et al., 2010). Notwithstanding, the presence\nof both ferrous iron and organic matter increases oxidant\nconsumption so that iron removal is required prior to manganese\noxidation (Ghaly et al., 2007; Gouzinis et al., 1998). Biological\nprocesses are an alternative, particularly for low manganese waters\n(Burger et al., 2008). The metal can also be precipitated as\ncarbonate, since manganese-bearing carbonate minerals such as\nrhodochrosite (MnCO3) and kutnahorite (CaMn(CO3)2), have been\nidentified in mine-affected waters; thus materials capable of\nreleasing CO3\n\n2? or HCO3\n? anions have application potential. Kutna-\n\nhorite precipitation was detected in mine waters with a high\ncontent of dissolved calcium, magnesium, manganese and CO2 and\nits precipitation was enhanced by higher pH values (Hem and Lind,\n1994). It is also proposed that dissolved manganese could precipi-\ntate as MnCO3, replacing calcium in calcite or co-precipitating with\nthe latter, provided there is supersaturation with respect to both\ncalcite and rhodochrosite (Lind and Hem, 1993).\n\nLimestone is the most common neutralizing agent for acid\nwaters (Douglas and Degens, 2005) due to its availability\n(Hammarstrom et al., 2003) and low-cost in many countries and it\nis likely to be either the first option for metal removal from many\nwastewaters or be combined with other treatment technologies\nsuch as sulfate reduction (Martins et al., 2010). In addition, dis-\nsolved carbonate is paramount for manganese carbonate forma-\ntion; otherwise manganese oxy-hydroxides are produced as\nalready observed in mine waters (Lind and Hem, 1993). Previous\nwork on manganese uptake by limestone showed efficient removal\nfor low to moderate manganese concentrations (16 mg/L), as well\nas the presence of manganese carbonate on the limestone surface\n(Silva et al., 2010). Bamforth et al. (2006) studied manganese\n(w3 mg/L) removal from a mine water with a total alkalinity of\n3 meq/L by dolomite, limestone, magnesite and quartzite. Besides\nthis, the authors observed kutnahorite formation on quartzite\nwhile magnesium-rich calcites were identified in the dolomite and\nmagnesite reactors, suggesting that the magnesium from the\nsubstrate minerals may have inhibited manganese carbonate\nformation. The authors concluded that the nature of the solid\nsubstrate does not affect manganese removal.\n\nWhen alkalinity is not sufficient for manganese precipitation,\nsoluble carbonate sources can be added to the reacting system.\nZhang et al. (2010) studied manganese removal with sodium\ncarbonate (Na2CO3) from effluents produced in hydrometallurgical\noperations. From a 1.76 g/L Mn solution at pH 5.9, manganese\nprecipitation occurred at pH above 7.5, reaching 90% removal at pH\n8.0. Higher removals could have been achieved provided the pH\nwas further increased. In addition, mineral carbonates such as\nlimestone have been shown to affect the manganese precipitation\npathway, hindering manganese carbonate formation. Accordingly,\nthe research described herein was undertaken to assess the effects\nof both soluble carbonate and limestone on manganese removal\nfrom a mine water with high-manganese content.\n\n2. Experimental\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nA calcite limestone sample assaying 39.5% calcium and 1.23%\nmagnesium was kindly provided by Brazilian producers. This\nsample was first sieved and subsequently dry ground in a vibrating\ncup mill (Pulverisette 9, Fritsch) and had its particle size distribu-\ntion assessed by laser diffraction (CILAS e 1064), which showed d50\nand d90 values of 5.6 mm and 18 mm, respectively. The limestone\nsurface area (1.52 m2/g) was measured by the N2 adsorption\nmethod (Quantachrome Nova 1000).\n\n2.2. Batch manganese removal experiments\n\nManganese removal experiments were carried out with\nsynthetic solutions as well as with mine water. Part of the batch\nexperiments was performed with calcite limestone mixed with\nsodium carbonate (Na2CO3); the other part being performed with\na mixture with either bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or sodium hydroxide.\nSynthetic solutions containing 140e2000 mg/L manganese\n(MnCl2$4H2O) prepared at pH 2.3e6.5 were studied. The experi-\nments were completed with a mine water sample assaying\n140.0 mg/L manganese and at pH 6.5. A volume of 120 mL solution\n(synthetic or mine water) was transferred to 250 mL Erlenmeyer\nflasks and mixed with different limestone (4.2e20.8 g/L) and\nsodium carbonate amounts (0.39e0.92 g/L). The flasks were kept\nunder agitation (450 min?1), during 90 min, at 23 ? 2 ?C. When the\nexperiments were finished, the pH value was recorded (Handylab 1,\nschott), the solid phase was filtered and the aqueous solution was\nanalyzed for manganese. The effect of time on manganese precip-\nitation was determined in a 2.0 L open Erlenmeyer flask where 1.5 L\nmanganese solution was mixed with both limestone (12.5 g/L) and\ncalcium carbonate (0.67 g/L), at pH 6.5 (initial value). This flask was\nstirred at 450 min?1, 23 ? 2 ?C and samples were withdrawn at\nevery 5 min for manganese determination.\n\n2.3. Continuous manganese removal experiments\n\nContinuous experiments were carried out in a stirred reactor\nwith a 1.67 L capacity, at 23 ? 2 ?C. The latter was fed separately\n\n\n\nA.M. Silva et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 29-30 (2012) 11e19 13\nwith (i) a 140 mg/L manganese-bearing mine water or synthetic\nmanganese solutions and (ii) a blend made up of limestone (12.5 g/L)\nand sodium carbonate (0.67 g/L). One experiment was carried out\nwith only sodium carbonate (same concentration); that is, in the\nabsence of limestone. The stirring rate was set at 1200 min?1 and\npumping was provided by two peristaltic pumps (Milan 628); one\nfeeding the manganese solution at 24.0 mL/min and the second,\na limestoneesodium carbonate blend (4.0 mL/min). Residence time\nwas set at 60 min and experiments ran for at least 9 resident times\nto ensure steady state conditions. After every 60 min, an aliquot\nwas withdrawn from the reactor, filtered and the manganese\ncontent and pH were determined. The solid residue was preserved\nfor further analysis (MEV-EDS and FTIR). Prior to and during the\nexperiments, the mine water was stored in plastic containers at\nroom temperature.\n2.4. Characterization\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the\nmorphology of the precipitates. The samples were coated with\ngraphite by electro-deposition, using a JEOL JEE 4C instrument.\nThey were then investigated by a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron\nmicroscope, with an accelerating voltage 0.5e30 kV, equipped with\na spectrometer for micro-analysis based on an energy dispersive X-\nray spectroscopy system (EDS).\n\nInfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyzes were carried out in\na Nicolet Nexus 470 model spectrophotometer, equipped with\na Centaurus microscope, an attenuated total reflectance (ATR)\napparatus (Thermo) and a ZnSe internal reflection devise. Medium\ninfrared measurements were produced with a KBr bean splitter and\nan HgCdTe detector. The samples were pressed against a flat glass\nsurface and mounted under the ATR apparatus. The spectra were\ncollected in the 400e4000 cm?1 region with a minimum of 32\nscans at 4 cm?1 resolution.\n\nThe mine water was analyzed, before and during the experi-\nments, for metals by using a Varian 725-ES inductively coupled\nplasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), or a Perkin Elmer\nAAnalyst 100 atomic absorption spectrometer and the results are\ndepicted in Table 1. The major constituents were manganese\n(140 mg/L), magnesium (90 mg/L) and sulfate (918 mg/L), while the\nminor elements were iron (2.2 mg/L), copper (0.22 mg/L) and zinc\n(0.78 mg/L).\n3. Results and discussions\n\nThe CP principles applied to the mine waters included: (i)\nreducing the production of contaminated mine waters; and (ii)\nTable 1\nMine water composition before and after continuous manganese removal experi-\nments.

Specifically, improving effluent quality and\noptimizing the treatment process so as to comply with the effluent\nregulations, are two of the most applied approaches (Dharmappa\net al., 2000). In this regard, manganese removal is currently one\nof the greatest challenges.\n\n3.1. Batch manganese removal\n\nManganese can be removed from both mine waters and\nindustrial wastewaters as different compounds and the form of\nremoval is defined by the water\u2019s chemistry, specially pH and Eh\nvalues. In oxidizing conditions, manganese oxy-hydroxides are\nformed, while manganese-bearing carbonate minerals, such as\nrhodochrosite (MnCO3) and kutnahorite (CaMn(CO3)2), are\nobserved to precipitate naturally in the presence of carbonate ions,\nif the pH is in the 7e11 range (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b presents manganese\nsolubility when considering the precipitation of either manganese\ncarbonate or hydroxide.

Also included in Fig. 1b is the theoretical manganese\nhydroxide solubility at 25 ?C and I 1 0. In the presence of\ncarbonate ions (10?3 mol/L dissolved carbonate) and pH values\nabove 8, the manganese concentration was reduced to values below\n10?5 mol/L. To achieve the same residual concentration, a pH value\nof 10 or higher was required when hydroxide precipitation was\nused. Therefore, carbonate precipitation ensured lower residual\nmanganese concentrations in neutral pH values when compared to\nmetal hydroxide removal. This observation is consistent with the\nfindings of Dayube and Trindade (2004), who stated that alkalinity\nwas one of the most cost-effective methods for manganese removal\nfrom mine waters. Another outcome, demonstrated in Fig. 1 was\nthat carbonate precipitation enabled easier compliance with envi-\nronmental regulations, as most countries define pH 9 as the\nmaximum allowable value for effluent (or mine water) discharge.\n\nIn this work, the approach utilized by Bamforth et al. (2006) was\nfollowed; thereby a combination of limestone and soluble\ncarbonate sources was studied. Experiments with synthetic solu-\ntions were carried out to determine the amount of both limestone\npowder (<45 mm) and sodium carbonate required for manganese\nremoval from a 140 mg/L synthetic manganese solution, which was\nthe same as the metal concentration in the studied mine water\n(Table 1). It can be observed in Fig. 2a, that limestone alone did not\nremove manganese effectively at such high concentrations. While\nthe pH increased to 7.9, the Mn2\u00fe concentration was reduced to\n120 mg/L when 25 g/L limestone was applied (Fig. 2a), which was\nequivalent to a manganese uptake of 0.98 mg Mn2\u00fe/g-limestone. In\na previous study by Silva et al. (2010), it was found that this was due\nto the manganese sorption on calcium carbonate. The authors also\nobserved a pH increase during manganese removal and similar\nmanganese uptake (1.28 mg Mn2\u00fe/g-limestone).\n\nUnlike powdered limestone, sodium carbonate precipitated\nmanganese extensively (Fig. 2b), as expected. In the presence of\n0.67 g/L sodium carbonate, the solution\u2019s pH reached 9.6 and the\nmanganese concentration was reduced to values below the detec-\ntion limit with the synthetic solution. Lower carbonate concen-\ntrations produced lower final pH values and thus higher residual\nmanganese concentrations in the aqueous phase as demonstrated\nin Fig. 1b. These results are consistent with the studies carried out\nby Zhang et al. (2010) during manganese removal from effluents\nproduced in hydrometallurgical operations, which also observed\nthat a pH value above 8.0 was needed to produce residual\nmanganese concentrations below 1 mg/L. Similarly, Costa (2006)\nobserved smaller residual manganese concentrations for\nincreasing pH values.\n\nThe effect of time on manganese removal is shown in Fig. 3 for\nexperiments comprising the application of different carbonate\nsources or sodium hydroxide. It can be observed that 12.5 g/L\nlimestone reduces the manganese concentration to 124 mg/L,\nwithin 100 min; that is, only 11% of the manganese was removed\nfrom the solution. When stoichiometrical concentrations of sodium\nbicarbonate (0.21 g/L) were mixed with a 140 mg/L manganese\nsolution in the absence of limestone, only a minor effect on met-\nal removal (15%) was noticed and the final manganese concentra-\ntion reached 120 mg/L, which was similar to the value observed\nwhen only calcium carbonate was applied. When the NaHCO3\nconcentration increased to 0.67 mg/L, manganese concentration\nreduced to 81.8 mg/L for a final pH value of 8.0. This behavior\nshould be compared to the experiments carried out with sodium\ncarbonate (Fig. 4).

For the\noptimum value defined in Fig. 2b (0.67 g/L), the residual manga-\nnese concentration in solution was below the detection limit; in\nother words, 100% removal was achieved. Fig. 3 also shows the\neffect of pH on the aqueous manganese concentration. After\n100 min, residual metal concentration attained 6.5 mg/L when the\npH was maintained in 10 with NaOH. With sodium hydroxide,\nmanganese was removed as manganese hydroxide, which was\nmore soluble than the manganese carbonate (species expected in\nthe presence of high carbonate concentrations). From the data\npresented in Figs. 3 and 4, it is clear that the presence of soluble\ncarbonate species was not the only factor accounting for metal\nremoval, but instead, the pH had a leading role on the removal\nefficiency (Sthiannopkao and Sreesai, 2009). Even at higher\ncarbonate concentrations, lower removal efficiencies were\nobserved with sodium bicarbonate (final pH 8.0) as compared to\nsodium carbonate (final pH 9.8) or even sodium hydroxide at pH\n10.0. Fig. 1 explains this behavior as it shows lower metal\nconcentrations in equilibrium with manganese carbonate when\nthe pH increased in the presence of carbonate ions. Fig. 4 also\nshows a fast reduction in the manganese concentration during the\nfirst 5 min, followed by a slower decrease in metal concentration\nwith time and suggests that 90 min was sufficient for the manga-\nnese concentration to be stabilized. In addition, manganese\nremoval from the mine water by sodium carbonateelimestone\nmixtures was slower than that observed from the synthetic solu-\ntion. The manganese concentration was reduced to 1 mg/L within\n60 min in the experiments with the latter, while 90 min was\nrequired for the metal concentration to reach 0.18 mg/L, at pH 8.6.\n\nIn addition to mine drainages, manganese can be also present in\neffluents of hydrometallurgical and other industrial operations and\nconcentrations above 1 g/L may be found. The element can also be\npresent in leaching liquors, for instance, during sea nodules and\nnickel laterite leaching (Zhang et al., 2010). In these studies,\nmanganese concentrations were high and the carbonate ions\nselectively precipitated the manganese in the presence of calcium\nand magnesium (Zhang and Cheng, 2007b). The carbonate effi-\nciency in increasing pH along with the manganese removal, was\nassessed from synthetic solutions, in which the manganese\nconcentration varied from 300.0 mg/L to 2000.0 mg/L, prepared at\nan initial pH value of 2.3. Fig. 5 shows that high-manganese\nremoval could be achieved provided sufficient carbonate was\nadded to the system. A residual manganese concentration below\n1 mg/L, along with solution pH values above 8.8, was observed for\nabove mentioned tested manganese concentrations. These results\nare consistent with the work of Jimenez et al. (2004) and Silva et al.\n(2010).\n\n3.2. Continuous manganese removal\n\nContinuous experiments were carried out as the preliminary\nstep of a future pilot scale test. Such experiments were performed\nwith both the synthetic solution and the mine water. Manganese\nremoval was faster when synthetic solutions were studied, as the\nmetal concentration was reduced from 140 mg/L to 0.8 mg/L in the\npresence of both limestone (12.5 g/L) and sodium carbonate\n(0.67 g/L) (Fig. 6), while the pH decreased from 10.2 to 8.5 in the\nfirst two resident times. After 8 resident times (480 min) and under\nthe same conditions, the manganese concentration reached\na concentration of 0.81 mg/L at pH 8.8. In the experiment carried\nout only with sodium carbonate, the final concentration was similar\n(0.81 mg/L); however, with a slower precipitation rate (likely due to\nthe absence of limestone in the reactor, which would have acted as\na surface for heterogeneous nucleation). This finding is supported\nby Aziz et al. (2008), who stated that the presence of solid lime-\nstone improves metal removal efficiencies. When the initial pH was\n2.3, manganese removal was also high because a higher sodium\ncarbonate concentration was applied (0.83 g/L) that increased the\nsolution pH to the 7.1e9.2 range.\n\nIt was also noticed that sulfate removal (Table 1) did not impair\nmanganese precipitation. This phenomenon was observed in\na previous work when powdered limestone was applied for\nmanganese removal from a 16 mg/L Mn2\u00fe and 2400 mg/L sulfate\nmine water. Silva et al. (2010) observed a reduction of the manga-\nnese removal from mine waters as compared to synthetic solutions\nand this was ascribed to sulfate precipitation on the limestone\nsurface. As shown in Table 1, the sulfate concentration (determined\nas total sulfur by ICP-OES) was reduced from 918 mg/L to 265 mg/L,\nwhich is slightly above the 250 mg/L discharge limit set by many\ncountries worldwide.

These\nmetals were shown to precipitate as either carbonates (FeCO3 and\nZnCO3) or mixed hydroxide-carbonate compounds (Djedidi et al.,\n2009), which seemed to be the case for copper and lead in the\npresent work. Nevertheless, sulfate may have affected manganese\nremoval kinetics, since its removal from mine water was slower\nthan from synthetic solutions and this was also observed in batch\nexperiments (Fig. 4). Notwithstanding, sulfate sorption by lime-\nstone is currently being investigated.\n680 700 720 740 760\n\n724cm\n-1\n\n712cm\n-1\n\nMnCO\n3\n\n ppt II\n\nMine water\n\nMnCO\n3\n\n ppt I\n\nMnCO\n3\n\n(p.a)\n\nLimestone\n\nIR shift (cm-1)\n\nFig. 7.

Characterization\n\nAs high carbonate concentration and pH values were utilized in\nthe present work, manganese removal as carbonate was expected\nas shown in Fig. 1a; thereby infrared spectroscopy was applied to\nconfirm manganese carbonate formation. This was achieved by\nanalyzing the solid material produced during manganese removal\nby limestoneesodium carbonate blends. Fig. 7 shows the spectra of\nlimestone before and after contact with the manganeseeladen\nsolutions. The spectrum of a sample of pure manganese\ncarbonate is also presented for comparison. For pure calcite lime-\nstone, a characteristic band assigned to the C]O shift was seen at\n712 cm?1. This absorption band was also observed at 724 cm?1 for\npure manganese carbonate, as proposed by the Nassrallah-\nAboukais et al. (1998), who found this characteristic band at\n726 cm?1 for rhodochrosite. Also, Makreski and Jovanovski (2003)\nobserved C]O shifts at 712 cm?1 and 722 cm?1, assigned to\nCaCO3 and MnCO3 in kutnahorite (CaMnMg(CO3)2). Similarly, this\nC]O band was observed at 728 cm?1 for manganese carbonate by\nSantill\u00e1n and Williams (2004). In addition to the C]O band at\n712 cm?1 (limestone), Fig. 7 also shows a smaller IR shift at\n724 cm?1 in the manganese-containing limestone produced in the\nexperiments with the mine water and those carried out with\nsynthetic solutions containing 300 mg/L (ppt. I) and 1500 mg/L(ppt.\nII) manganese (Fig. 5). The formation of manganese carbonate was\nconfirmed by FTIR and the C]O band at 724 cm?1 was easily seen\nwhen the mass of precipitated manganese carbonate was larger\n(ppt. II). These results are supported by XPS studies on\nmanganeseecalcite interactions (Blanchard and Baer, 1992).\nBamforth et al. (2006) studied metal carbonate precipitation in\nthe presence of limestone aiming to treat a mine water containing\nup to 5 mg/L manganese in the presence of calcium (w200 mg/L)\nand magnesium (80e100 mg/L). Manganese carbonate was not\nobserved on the surface of limestone even though the mine water\npresented 2 meq/L total alkalinity. Contrarily, magnesium calcite\nwas the only described precipitate on the surfaces of dolomite,\nmagnesite or limestone and it was suggested that the presence of\nmagnesium inhibited manganese carbonate formation. For the\nmine water studied in the present work, Table 1 suggests that the\ncalcium removal was negligible, likely derived from limestone\ndissolution during the experiments as previously discussed (Fig. 2).\nConversely, magnesium was also removed from the mine water, as\nits concentration was reduced from 90.0 mg/L to 21.3 mg/L.\nNevertheless, MgCO3 which has the C]O characteristic band at\n749 cm?1 (Grzechnik et al., 1999) could not be detected in Fig. 7,\npossibly due to the low MgCO3 amount co-precipitated with\nmanganese. The findings of Bamforth et al. (2006) seem to be\nrelated to the high Mg/Mn ratio (>20) in the mine water studied,\nwhich did not seem to be the case herein presented where the\ninitial Mg/Mn ratio was 0.64.\n\nThe precipitates were also analyzed by SEM-EDS. Fig. 8 depicts\nlimestone particles containing manganese produced under\ndifferent conditions. Fig. 8a and b shows both the images and the\nEDS spectra of the solid material produced in the experiment with\nthe mine water, while Fig. 8c and d shows limestone particles\ncontaining manganese precipitated in the experiments utilizing\n300 mg/L and 2000 mg/L of Mn2\u00fe, respectively. All the EDS spectra\nshowed calcium which was an indication that the larger particles\nwere limestone, whereas Fig. 8b and c depicts manganese mapping.\nWhile the EDS spectra identified manganese on the surface of all\nthe analyzed limestone particles, Fig. 8b and 8c suggests that\nmanganese carbonate precipitated as very fine crystals, which was\nfurther supported by (i) an increase in both surface and micropore\nareas from 1.54 m2/g and 2.20 m2/g to 4.45 m2/g and 5.30 m2/g,\nrespectively; (ii) a reduction on d50 of the particle size distribution\nfrom 5.6 mm to 3.6 mm, which suggested a higher proportion of fine\nparticles.\n\nThe produced manganese carbonate, although contaminated\nwith magnesium, can be blended with manganese carbonate and\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

Silva et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 29-30 (2012) 11e19 17\nsmelted for the production of manganese ferroalloys. Magnesium\ncarbonate is always present in these ores and is applied in the slag\nproduction step (O\u2019Shaughnessy et al., 2004). It can also be applied\nin the production of manganese dioxide, since manganese\ncarbonate is easily soluble in sulfuric acid solutions (Zhang and\nCheng, 2007a) without requiring any reducing agent. It is very\nlikely that mine waters or process effluents with high-manganese\nconcentrations would be generated in a manganese mine or\n\n\n\nA.M. Silva et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 29-30 (2012) 11e1918\na manganese producing plant. Therefore, this blending could likely\nbe carried out in a cost-effective way.\n\nFigs. 1e3 explain manganese removal efficiency with sodium\ncarbonate solutions. Besides the carbonate concentration, pH\ncontrol was also an important parameter for effective manganese\ncarbonate precipitation, as previously stated. Manganese carbonate\nsolubility increased quickly with acidity and even for high\ncarbonate/metal ratios, but at lower pH values, precipitation might\nnot be complete. Bamforth et al. (2006) observed low manganese\nremoval (30%) with a mine water containing an average of 3 mg/L\nmanganese, at pH 8.1, irrespective of the solid substrate utilized.\nConversely, Silva et al. (2010) observed complete manganese\nremoval from a 16.0 mg/L mine water at pH 8.8 with fine powdered\nlimestone. The reason for the low removal reported by the former\nwas likely the lower pH of the mine water, which could not support\nextensive manganese carbonate formation. For mine waters con-\ntaining high-manganese and relatively low calcium and magne-\nsium concentrations, manganese carbonate can be actually\nobserved on limestone surfaces, provided the mine water pH is\nincreased. When limestone is present, removal kinetics is improved\nand a denser solid residue is produced, probably having better\nsettling features than the manganese carbonate alone. Future pilot\nscale experiments will aim at determining process parameters and\nthe economics of an industrial scale process.\n\nAs discussed beforehand, water utilization in the mining\nindustry and the effects of mining activities on water bodies have\nalways been considered an important issue (Kemp et al., 2010). This\nis due to potential conflicts with nearby communities or even the\ncountry as a whole. Water has many uses in mining and therefore\nwater storage (either clean or polluted) in dams is required in most\nmining operations worldwide. In wet climates, for instance tailing\ndams are always a concern as the discharge of excess water during\nwet seasons and spills (which are not uncommon) may have\nimportant environmental consequences, such as the cyanide spill\nobserved in Guiana (Beebe, 2001) and in Romania (DeVries, 2001)\nin late 20th and early 21st centuries, respectively. Another issue is\ncompetition for access to water with other industries, agriculture\nand human use as observed in water-scarce countries (Aitchison,\n2008). In this particular context, a breakthrough solution was\nadopted when a mining company started treating AMD and selling\ndrink water to the neighborhood community (Hutton et al., 2009).\n\nTo summarize, water can be an important source of contaminant\nmobilization (Driussi and Jansz, 2006) and manganese, which has\na high solubility in water bodies is one of the most difficult toxic\nmetals to be removed. Although management measures are the\nmost important aspect of CP (Hilson, 2000), manganese removal\ntechnologies are an important contribution for the full imple-\nmentation of CP technologies in the mining industry.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nLimestoneesodium carbonate blends were beneficial for\nmanganese removal from mine waters. Sodium carbonate provided\ncarbonate ions to precipitate high-manganese contents in mine\nwater and industrial effluents, whereas powdered limestone\ninduced the heterogeneous nucleation of manganese carbonate.\nManganese removal efficiency was defined by pH with values above\n8.5 resulting in massive metal removal from the solution. Manga-\nnese carbonate precipitation was confirmed by both infrared and\nEDS spectroscopy. Powdered limestone enhanced manganese\nprecipitation kinetics and produced a denser solid residue with\npotential advantages regarding settling properties. Future work will\nfocus on (i) the reduction of sodium carbonate consumption by\nincreasing the solution pH before Na2CO3 addition; (ii) the chemical\nstability of the precipitated manganese carbonate and (iii)\nmanganese carbonate calcining. Research on manganese removal\nshould also address alternative solid substrates such as MnO2;\nlimestone sorption of other species present in the mine water, i.e.\nsulfate, whereas field tests would determine any positive influence\nof soluble carbonate additions to the mine water before their\npassage in anoxic limestone drains, which is the main application of\nlimestone for the treatment of mine waters.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe financial support from the funding agencies FINEP, FAPEMIG,\nCNPq and CAPES gratefully appreciated.
