The number of insects per leaflet\nwas evaluated weekly, and at harvest the yield (kg ha-1) and the\nweight of 100 seeds (g) were recorded. The soybean was tolerant\nto whitefly, since only the treatment where nymphs per leaflet\nreached 136.31\u00b126.60 (treatment without the use of insecticides)\nwas sufficiently severe to cause yield loss. This loss was likely\nassociated with the sooty mold, caused by the fungus Capnodium\nsp. that develops in the sugary secretion produced by the whitefly\non the surface of plant leaves. Therefore, insecticides should\nonly be sprayed when a whitefly infestation is sufficiently severe\nto trigger the growth of sooty mold. The relationship between\ninsect number per leaf and the growth of sooty mold still needs\nto be determined for different soybean cultivars, as well as for\ndifferent environmental conditions.\n\nKey words: Bemisia tabaci, economic threshold, Glycine max,\nSoybean-IPM.\n\nRESUMO\n\nExperimentos foram conduzidos em Para\u00fana,\nGoi\u00e1s, Brasil, avaliando o impacto da mosca-branca na\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de soja.

Therefore, the increase insecticide use\nand its consequently increase in soybean production\ncosts due to B. tabaci infestations is mainly a\nconsequence of this lack of awareness of the number\nof pests that justifies its control (ET). This had led\nsoybean growers to apply insecticides indiscriminately.\nExcessive use of insecticides has only worsened the\nproblem with the pest, since it favors the selection of\nresistant insects to the chemicals used, making the\nso ybean pr oduction system unsustainab le\n(PALUMBO et al., 2001).\n\nT hus, within the context of Soybean\nIntegrated Pest Management (Soybean IPM), which is\nbased on the use of a control method, only when\nnecessary, it is important to consider ET. The ET is\ndefined as the number of pests that justifies the use of\na control to prevent the pest population from increasing\nto the Economic Injury Level (EIL) where profits lost\noccurs (STERN et al., 1959). Consequently, the\nestablishment of the ET is crucial to chemical control\n(PEDIGO &amp; HIGLEY, 1996). However, to determine the\nET, it is necessary to quantify the damage caused by\nthe pest and the population density that will cause\nyield reduction (ELLSWORTH &amp; MARTINEZ\nCARRILLO, 2001). In the case of B. tabaci, this is a\ngreat challenge, due to certain distinctive characteristics\nof the insect. Among these characteristics are its feeding\nmode (phloem sucking), its small size, and its capacity\nto transmit diseases (ELLSWORTH &amp; MARTINEZ-\nCARRILLO, 2001). As a consequence, there is a lack of\nstudies correlating whitefly infestations with soybean\nyield. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of\ndifferent intensities of infestations of B. tabaci on\nsoybean yield, in order to establish the most appropriate\ntiming for insecticide use.\n\nMATERIAL   AND   METHODS\n\nTwo field trials were carried out in Para\u00fana,\nState of Goi\u00e1s in central Brazil, during the years of 2008\nand 2009, with different intensities of whitefly\ninfestation. One sample of insects was collected at the\nfirst day of the trials and was identified by PCR-RAPD\nof genomic DNA as B. tabaci biotype B.\n\nGoi\u00e1s State is one of the most important\nregions of soybean cropping in Brazil, the second\nlargest producer worldwide. Soybean cultivar \u2018P98R31\u2019\n(maturity group 8.3 and indeterminate growth habit)\nwas sown at the density of 11.5 seeds/linear meter in\n\nthe first trial (trial 1), which was conducted under lower\npest infestation pressure (where even on untreated\nplots the number of nymph per leaflet was not superior\nto 47.05) compared to trial 2. The same cultivar and the\nsame sowing density were used in a second trial (trial\n2), carried out in an area with higher infestation pressure\n(where on untreated plots the number of nymph per\nleaflet was 136.31). The row spacing used was 0.5m\nbetween rows, and the trial sites were irrigated via\ncentral pivot. Fungicides and herbicides were applied\nequally in all trials, according to the cultural practices\ncommonly adopted by local growers (one post-\nemergence application of herbicide, glyphosate, 3\nweeks after plant emergence, and three applications of\nfungicides, tebuconazol + trifloxystrobin, during the\nsoybean reproductive stage).\n\nThe experimental design was a randomized\nblock, with four treatments and four replications. Each\nplot was 10m wide and 20m long. Since trials were carried\nout in a field with natural infestation, the choices of the\ntreatment were made accordingly to the natural occurrence\nof the insect and also taking into consideration that\ngrowers usually apply insecticide when 10 nymphs are\nfound per leaflet. Thus, the treatments evaluated varied\nbetween both trials (Table 1) but were always two\nspraying timing; a control plot that was kept free of\ninsects by weekly applications of insecticide\n[piriproxifen, 25g of active ingredient (a.i) ha-1], and an\ninfested control treatment without any insecticide\nspraying. In the area of the first experiment, a lower\ninfestation of whitefly occurred (where even on\nuntreated plots the number of nymph per leaflet was\nnot superior to 47.05), and for that reason the\napplications of insecticides were performed when the\npopulation of B. tabaci reached 10 or 40 nymphs per\nleaflet. In the second experiment, due to the higher\npopulation of the pest (where on untreated plots the\nnumber of nymph per leaflet was 136.31), the\ninsecticides were applied when the population reached\n60 or 120 nymphs per leaflet (Figures 1A and 1B).\n\nThe whitefly infestation level in each plot was\nevaluated weekly, by counting the number of B. tabaci\nnymphs present on 14 leaflets randomly collected from\nthe middle third of the plants, located in the center of each\nexperimental plot. At the end of the season, the average\nB. tabaci from the whole season for each treatment could\nalso be evaluated. Additionally a visual percentage of\nleaf canopy coverage by the sooty mold fungus caused\nby Capnodium sp. was recorded also on a weekly basis.\nAt the end of the crop cycle, the soybeans were harvested\nseparately for each treatment, evaluating productivity (kg\nha-1) and the weight of 100 seeds (g) (corrected to 13%\n\n\n\n249Different timing of whitefly control and soybean yield.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.43, n.2, fev, 2013.\n\nseed moisture). The results were subjected to exploratory\nanalyses to evaluate the assumption of normality of\nresidues, homogeneity of variance of treatments, and\nadditivity of the model, to allow for the ANOVA and\nthe multiple comparisons of means by the Tukey test\n(P       0.05) (SAS INSTITUTE, 2001).\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn trial 1, carried out under lower pest\ninfestation (Figure 1A), there was no statistically\nsignificant difference in yield among the different levels\nof B. tabaci infestation (Table 1). In this experiment,\nthe highest numbers of B. tabaci occurred at the\nsoybean R3 reproductive stage, and in the treatment\nwithout application of insecticide, the number of\nnymphs/leaflet reached 47.05\u00b16.03, which was\nstatistically similar to the treatment with spraying at 40\nnymphs per leaflet (Figure 1A). The pest infestation\ndecreased naturally from stage R3 to R6, even in the\ntreatment where no insecticide was applied and at R6\nstage there was no statistical differences among the\ntreatments (Figure 1A) resulting in no yield difference\namong treatments (Table 1). Similarly to the results for\nyield (kg ha-1), the weight of 100 seeds (g) was also\nstatistically equal among the treatments (Table 1).\n\nIn trial 2, whitefly pressure was higher\n(Figure 1B) than in the first trial (Figure 1A). The\n\nnumber of B. tabaci nymphs per leaflet reached\n136.31\u00b126.60 in the treatment without insecticide at the\nR2 reproductive stage, statistically similar to treatment\nof spray with 120 nymphs per leaflet (Figure 1B).\nSimilarly to what occurred in trial 1, the pest population\ndecreased naturally in the second trial, to a population\nof 15 nymphs per leaflet at the R6 reproductive stage\n(Figures 1A and 1B) even though the pest outbreak at\nthe treatment without insecticide kept always higher\nthan the other treatments (Figure 1B).\n\nDespite the higher infestation of B. tabaci\nin the second experiment (Figure 1B), the yield differed\nstatistically only between the treatments with weekly\napplication of insecticides and the treatment with no\ninsecticide application (Table 1). In spite of this\nsignificant difference in productivity, no differences in\nthe weight of 100 seeds were recorded (Table 1). Notably,\nthere were no statistical differences among the treatment\nwith weekly application of insecticides and the\ntreatments with insecticide application only when the\npopulation of the pest reached 60 nymphs per leaflet,\nor the treatment when the insecticide was sprayed when\nthe population reached 120 nymphs per leaflet (Table\n1). Nevertheless, it is important to point out the growth\nof sooty mold, covering close to 100% of the surface\nof bottom leaves, only occurred in the treatment without\napplication of insecticides in the second trial, when\nthe whitefly population was higher.\n\nTable 1 - Average number of insect per leaflet from whole crop season, soybean yield and seed weight (Mean \u00b1 SE) after chemical control at\ndifferent times.\n\nTreatment Average B. tabaci nymphs leaflet-1 Yield (kg ha-1) Weight of 100 seeds (g)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------Trial 1 (lower insect pressure)-------------------------- ----------------------------------------\nWeekly control 6.50 \u00b1 0.55 c 3,194.84 \u00b1 309.90ns 15.29 \u00b1 1.23ns\n\nWithout control (untreated) 26.48 \u00b1 2.43 a 2,452.08 \u00b1 357.00 14.28 \u00b1 0.73\nSpray with 40 nymphs/leaflet 14.77 \u00b1 1.13 b 3,093.83 \u00b1 76.15 14.81 \u00b1 0.24\nSpray with 10 nymphs/leaflet 8.95 \u00b1 0.57 bc 3,298.51 \u00b1 121.30 14.16 \u00b1 0.54\nCV (%) 20.25 17.58 11.00\nF 19.64 2.08 0.42\nP&lt;0.0001 0.1738 0.7422\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------Trial 2 (higher insect pressure) ------------------------------------------------------------------\nWeekly control 22.21 \u00b1 1.63 c 4,992.51 \u00b1 220.34 a 14.37 \u00b1 0.71ns\n\nWithout control (untreated) 58.48 \u00b1 4.45 a 3,486.88 \u00b1 193.42 b 12.81 \u00b1 0.22\nSpray with 120 nymphs/leaflet 34.60 \u00b1 4.05 b 3,963.38 \u00b1 304.11 ab 13.93 \u00b1 0.33\nSpray with 60 nymphs/leaflet 20.31 \u00b1 1.32 c 4,404.18 \u00b1 384.11 ab 13.79 \u00b1 0.35\nCV (%) 16.35 14.78 7.15\nF 21.22 4.25 1.82\nP&lt;0.0001 0.0397 0.2144\n\nMeans followed by the same letter within the column and trial are not statistically different by the Tukey test (P>0.05).nsNon-Significant\nDifferences (P>0.05).\n\n\n\n250 Vieira et al.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.43, n.2, fev, 2013.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn addition to direct injuries caused by\nfeeding, B. tabaci can also transmit viruses (carlavirus,\nclosterovirus, geminivirus, luteovirus and potyvirus,\namong others) in several different crops including\nsoybeans (MORALES &amp; ANDERSON, 2001). On\nsoybean plants, the whitefly is the vector of a virus of\nthe carlavirus group responsible for the disease called\nsoybean stem necrosis. Soybean plants infected with\n\nthis virus display necrosed stems, which as the\nsymptoms progress may kill the entire plant. This\ndisease was not observed in either trial in this study,\nmost probably because the soybean cultivar \u2018P98R31\u2019\nis resistant to the virus. In this context, since soybean\ncultivars with resistance to \u2018soybean stem necrosis\u2019\nare already available; growers can manage this problem\nby sowing resistant cultivars. This strategy was\nfollowed in this study, which focused on evaluating\ndirect damage caused by whitefly feeding.\n\nFigure 1 - Number of whitefly Bemisia tabaci nymphs per leaflet (Mean \u00b1 SE) after control at\ndifferent infestation intensities of the pest. [(A) Experiment 1 (lower insect pressure); (B)\nExperiment 2 (higher insect pressure)].   The arrow indicates the timing of the insecticide\nspray. Means followed by the same letter at the same crop development stage do not differ\nstatistically from each other by the Tukey test, at (P>0.05).\n\n?\n\n\n\n251Different timing of whitefly control and soybean yield.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.43, n.2, fev, 2013.\n\nIn both trials, only whitefly infestation that\nreached 136.31 nymphs per leaflet (Figure 1B) was\nsufficiently severe to cause significant yield losses\n(Table 1). However, it is important to take into\nconsideration that absence of damage might be a\ncultivar feature that differs among different soybean\ncultivars (VIEIRA et al., 2011). For example, LAMBERT\net al. (1995, 1997) observed significant differences in\nsoybean varietal response to whitefly population\ndensities and antixenosis resistance response for the\nPerrin, Cook, and N88-91 soybean genotypes, compared\nto the susceptible varieties Braxton and Cobb in field\nconditions. Therefore, it is important, in future\nresearches, to test other different cultivars with various\nwhitefly infestation intensities, in order to gather this\ninformation for as many soybean cultivars as possible.\n\nAmong the injuries caused by B. tabaci,\nwhen the insect occurs in large populations, are the\nplants weakened by the extraction of large amounts of\nsap. This induces early defoliation and impacts the\nsoybean plant development and yield, as observed in\nsome soybean fields under attack of this pest (VIEIRA\net al., 2011). Another problem is that B. tabaci can\ncause chlorosis in the leaves of attacked plants,\nreducing photosynthesis (LIN et al., 1999). However,\nthe number of B. tabaci on the soybean plants that\ntriggers these types of damage is not yet well\nestablished. Similarly, there is no clear distinction\nbetween the direct effects of the injuries caused by the\ninsect and the indirect effects caused by the growth of\nsooty mold on the leaves.\n\n The growth of sooty mold on the plant\nleaves is an indirect consequence of whitefly feeding,\nsince the insect excretes honeydew, a sweet and sticky\nsubstance produced in response to excessive feeding\non plant sap. When exposed to sunlight, honeydew\nsupports the growth of Capnodium sp., a black fungus\ncalled sooty mold, on the leaf surface. Generally, the\npresence of sooty mold increases the temperature of\nthe leaves and literally \u201cburns\u201d the plant by solar\nradiation. Sooty mold can also block solar radiation,\nthus reducing the photosynthesis rate of the leaves\n(OLIVEIRA et al., 2001). In the present study, sooty\nmold was detected only on the control treatment of the\nexperiment conducted in the area with higher infestation\nof the pest (Figure 1B). At R4 stage sooty mold appeared\ncovering 20% of the total leaf surface of all leaves of\nbottom plant canopy. From R5 to R6, the fungus\nincreased covering 30% of the total leaf surface of all\nleaves of bottom and medium plant canopy and this is\nprobably directly associated with the reduction of\nproductivity observed in that specific treatment (Table\n1) since in all the other treatments no sooty mold was\n\nobserved. After R6 leaves started senescence and sooty\nmold did not covered more than 30% of leaf surface. It\nis important to point out that the Capnodium sp.\ngrowing might differ among different plants and\nclimatic conditions. AZEVEDO &amp; BLEICHER (2002)\nobserved sooty mold growing on melon crops when\nonly 4 to 8 whitefly adults per 2.8cm2 of foliar area was\nrecorded, number that was then considered ET to start\ninsecticide spraying at that crop. At cotton, only 2.08\nwhiteflies per leaf were responsible for 30.84% of yield\nloss (ALENCAR et al., 2002). Differently, JEON et al.\n(2009) observed a higher tolerance on cucumber plants\nwhen fruit damage only occurred from 63 days after\nTrialeurodes vaporariorum infestation. This indicates\na great variability of plant response to whitefly injury.\nTherefore, new trials with different soybean cultivars\nand climatic conditions are also important since this\nkind of variation in the results might also occur among\ndifferent soybean cultivars and areas where the crop is\ncultivated. Nevertheless, our data are the first report\non soybean response to whitefly attack and can be\ntaken as a primary result for future researches.\n\nMoreover, B. tabaci probably can also\nreduce leaf photosynthesis by altering this\nphysiological process in response to its feeding,\nind ependently o f the gr owth of sooty mo ld\n(PETERSON &amp; HIGLEY, 1993). Establishing these\nalterations is an important step in further understanding\nplant-whitefly interaction. BUENO et al. (2005) reported\nthat 79 B. tabaci adults per soybean plant, at the V2\ndevelopment stage, were not sufficient to reduce plant\nphotosynthetic capacity. The population size of B.\ntabaci capable of initiating photosynthetic reduction\non soybean plants is still unknown, and is one of the\nchallenges for future research in this area.\n\nThe determination of the precise relationship\nbetween the infestation of a given pest and the\nconsequent loss in crop productivity is the first step in\nestablishing the ET to be used in taking the decision to\nimplement a control method. In this study, the lack of\nreduction in productivity observed in most of the\ntreatments may also be associated with the natural\nreduction of the B. tabaci population that occurred\nalong the crop cycle. In addition, the chemical control\nused to reduce the pest population was highly efficient.\nIn the treatments with insecticide sprays (40 to 120\nnymphs leaflet-1), only a single application was enough\nto maintain the infestations below these pre-established\nlevels for the experiments, until harvest (Figures 1A\nand 1B).\n\nThe insecticide used, piriproxifen, is a growth\nregulator, a juvenoide that acts by impairing the normal\nbalance of hormones, resulting in the suppression of\n\n\n\n252 Vieira et al.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.43, n.2, fev, 2013.\n\nembryogenesis, metamorphosis, and the formation of\nthe adult insect (DHADIALLA et al., 1998). The\nefficiency of this insecticide in controlling the whitefly\nis due to its ovicidal action as well as its high capacity of\nlaminar translocation (PALUMBO et al., 2001). It is\npossible that in different circumstances than in this\nstudy, in longer-enduring infestations, where the injuries\ncaused by the insects remained for a longer period or if\nanother, less efficient insecticide were used, thus\nallowing a rapid resurgence of the pest, productivity\ncould be more severely affected by the feeding of B.\ntabaci, and sooty mold would be more prevalent\n(PEDIGO, 1996). These are hypotheses, however, that\nneed to be tested in future studies and do not impair the\nimportance of the results herein reported.\n\nAnother important point to take into\nconsideration is that before opting for a control method\nfor the management of a pest, it is essential to determine\nwhether the anticipated cost of the reduction in yield\ncaused by the pest will be higher than the cost of the\ncontrol method, a parameter that is taken into\nconsideration in the EIL calculation (STERN et al.,\n1959). Thus, the EIL should be regarded as dynamic\nand variable in different agricultural conditions, and\nalso the interactions among the components of its\ndefinition must be taken into account (PEDIGO et al.,\n1986). For soybeans, although it varies with different\nlocalities and years, the cost of application of\npiriproxifen is usually higher than the value of one\nstandard bag of soybeans (60kg), and this high cost\nmust also be taken into account in deciding on the\nbest time to initiate control.\n\nMany so ybean gr ower s ar e ap plying\ninsecticide to control whiteflies at low infestation. In\nBrazil, for example, insecticide spraying usually occurs\nwhen 10 nymphs per leaflet are present. Often, this\ncontrol is decided empirically by field technicians,\naccording to personal perceptions acquired in their field\nexperience. The results obtained here, however, attest\nthat an application based on levels of infestations of\n10 nymphs per leaflet is certainly much too early and\nincurs unnecessary costs and environmental danger.\nNevertheless, for a broaden computation of the ET for\nthe whitefly, other experiments could be conducted, to\nevaluate other factors such as different production\nsystems, different levels of pest infestation and\ndifferent agro-climate conditions, in addition to the\nlevels of tolerance among different soybean cultivars.\nAs stated above, it is also important to evaluate the\ncorrelation between the number of nymphs and the\ngrowth of sooty mold, since the occurrence of sooty\nmold seems to be directly linked to the capacity of the\nwhitefly to reduce the soybean yield.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, based on the results obtained\nhere, only whitefly infestations severe enough to trigger\nthe growth of sooty mold would be able to reduce\nsoybean yield and justify the use of insecticides before\nthe fungus becomes widespread. The needless use of\ninsecticides in controlling B. tabaci when the number\nof nymphs is still below the level of 40 nymphs per\nleaflet should be avoided. It is important to point out\nthat these results are from a single soybean cultivar\nand therefore is only a preliminary result in this field of\nresearch. However, considering the cultivar used and\nthe climatic conditions of the trials (maximum and\nminimum temperature of 30.8oC and 20.3oC, respectively,\nand a precipitation of 821.8mm) this is an important\nresult and brings more appropriated economic threshold\n(ET) for starting insecticide spray on soybean against\nwhitefly outbreaks.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful to Conselho Nacional de\nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq) (process #\n565817/2008-6) and to Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de\nPessoal de N\u00edvel Superior (CAPES) (process # 23038.035744/\n2008-89).\n\nREFERENCES\n\nALENCAR, et al.
