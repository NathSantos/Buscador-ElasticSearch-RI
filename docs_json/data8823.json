The rise in atmospheric \n\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, resulting from anthropogenic activities, is responsible for the \n\nincrease in the dissolved state of this gas in the oceans. The consequent changes in pH and seawater \n\ncarbonate chemistry are responsible for the disruption of several biological processes (e.g. impairing \n\nsurvival and the maintenance of fitness-enhancing, physiological and behavioural, mechanisms) in \n\ncertain marine groups. Disruption at the individual level, can originate negative cascading effects at \n\nhigher levels of biological organization (i.e. populations and communities), which in turn can alter the \n\nunderlying dynamics that control an ecosystem\u2019s structure and overall function. Current theories suggest \n\nthat marine organisms might be able to maintain their performance in future OA conditions, either \n\nthrough acclimation or through evolutionary adaptation. Surprisingly, the effects of prolonged high-CO2 \n\nexposure in crustaceans are still poorly known. The present dissertation investigates, for the first time, \n\nthe transgenerational effects (i.e. over two generations) of ocean acidification in the physiology, \n\nbehaviour (e.g. male mate-attraction) and reproductive traits (e.g. female investment, fecundity, mate-\n\nguarding and embryonic development) of the gammarid amphipod Gammarus locusta. Significant \n\neffects of ocean acidification were found for most reproductive traits. Although OA may initially \n\nstimulate female investment, transgenerational exposure led to an overall reduction in egg number and \n\nfecundity. The duration of mate-guarding behaviours was also diminished under high-CO2 exposure. \n\nIndividuals from the second generation (F1) exhibited metabolic depression (i.e. reduced oxygen \n\nconsumption rates), and males also displayed a reduced ability to accurately identify and track the origin \n\nof female scent cues, thus hinting at a possible disruption of chemosensory abilities. Overall, negative \n\ntransgenerational (i.e. parental) effects were observed for all reproductive traits, as well as survival, in \n\nthe acidified lineage. The present findings suggest that exposure to a future ocean acidification scenario \n\nwill likely lead to a reduction in the fitness of the natural populations of G. locusta.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: ocean acidification, transgenerational, evolution, behaviour, reproduction \n\n  \n\n\n\n  VI \n\nResumo \n\n  \n\n O ambiente marinho encontra-se sob amea\u00e7a das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas. A acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\noceanos, assim como o aumento da temperatura m\u00e9dia das \u00e1guas, constitui um risco global \u00e0 \n\nbiodiversidade marinha. O aumento significativo da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de di\u00f3xido de carbono (CO2) na \n\natmosfera, resultante das atividades humanas e experienciado desde o in\u00edcio da Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o Industrial, \n\ntem vindo a provocar grandes altera\u00e7\u00f5es na qu\u00edmica dos oceanos, num processo que pode ser designado \n\npor hipercapnia, i.e., o aumento das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2 nas \u00e1guas, com o potencial para alterar \n\nsignificativamente muitos dos processos biol\u00f3gicos necess\u00e1rios \u00e0 manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da sa\u00fade e equil\u00edbrio dos \n\necossistemas. Ainda que inicialmente identificada como uma amea\u00e7a para organismos considerados \n\nmais suscet\u00edveis (e.g. invertebrados calcificadores), a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos e, consequentemente, a \n\nhipercapnia, tem vindo a ser reconhecida como um potencial risco \u00e0 sobreviv\u00eancia e \u00e0 manuten\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nmecanismos fisiol\u00f3gicos e comportamentais que s\u00e3o fulcrais \u00e0 otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do fitness dos organismos \n\nmarinhos, e para o equil\u00edbrio das popula\u00e7\u00f5es naturais de in\u00fameros organismos marinhos. Tais efeitos \n\nir\u00e3o levar, inevitavelmente, a repercuss\u00f5es tanto ao n\u00edvel das comunidades, como \u00e0 altera\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ndin\u00e2mica que controla a estrutura e o equil\u00edbrio dos ecossistemas naturais.   \n\n Quando o CO2 entra no corpo dos indiv\u00edduos, por difus\u00e3o, tende a equilibrar-se rapidamente em \n\ntodos os compartimentos corporais, tendo um efeito predominantemente acidificante capaz de perturbar \n\nsignificativamente o equil\u00edbrio \u00e1cido-base interno de um indiv\u00edduo. Desta forma, o CO2 poder\u00e1 levar a \n\nmudan\u00e7as que ir\u00e3o afectar as taxas metab\u00f3licas e a aloca\u00e7\u00e3o natural de energia entre os v\u00e1rios processos \n\ncorporais do organismo. Embora os seres vivos marinhos possuam, no geral, mecanismos que permitem \n\najustar o organismo \u00e0 hipercapnia, estes poder\u00e3o n\u00e3o ser suficientes para exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de longo prazo a \n\ndeterminados n\u00edveis de stress prolongado, e ter como consequ\u00eancia o comprometimento da \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia, do metabolismo e do crescimento dos indiv\u00edduos, mas tamb\u00e9m da sua reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o e do \n\ncomportamento. Estima-se que as esp\u00e9cies iono- ou osmorreguladoras ser\u00e3o, em princ\u00edpio, mais \n\ntolerantes aos n\u00edveis futuros de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos, uma vez que possuem os mecanismos \n\ncompensat\u00f3rios adequados que lhes permitem responder a perturba\u00e7\u00f5es externas ao equil\u00edbrio \u00e1cido-\n\nbase. Tipicamente, estas esp\u00e9cies habitam ambientes costeiros pouco profundos e sob influ\u00eancia de \n\nfontes de \u00e1gua doce, onde est\u00e3o expostas a varia\u00e7\u00f5es naturais e por vezes abruptas dos par\u00e2metros \n\nabi\u00f3ticos \u2013 como o pH, salinidade, temperatura, etc.  \n\n Os crust\u00e1ceos s\u00e3o considerados um grupo bastante resiliente e capaz de se adaptar \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndo oceano de amanh\u00e3. Durante a \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, tem-se verificado um aumento no interesse do estudo \n\ndos efeitos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o nos crust\u00e1ceos intertidais. Estes organismos desempenham um papel crucial \n\nnas cadeias tr\u00f3ficas, sendo n\u00e3o s\u00f3 consumidores prim\u00e1rios e secund\u00e1rios de grande relev\u00e2ncia, bem \n\ncomo servindo de alimento para n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos superiores \u2013 e.g. peixes, aves marinhas e lim\u00edcolas, etc. \n\nS\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m caracterizados por uma elevada variedade de respostas a mudan\u00e7as ambientais, desde \n\nregula\u00e7\u00e3o ativa face a altera\u00e7\u00f5es abi\u00f3ticas externas, a conforma\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s novas condi\u00e7\u00f5es, etc. A maioria \n\ndos crust\u00e1ceos s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m esp\u00e9cies em contato direto com o meio envolvente, atrav\u00e9s de estruturas \n\nespecializadas (como br\u00e2nquias ou outras estruturas equivalentes), que s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis por trocas de \n\ng\u00e1s e de i\u00f5es. Apesar de mais tolerantes \u00e0 hipercapnia, o ajuste do equil\u00edbrio \u00e1cido-base dos crust\u00e1ceos \n\ndever\u00e1 ter elevados custos metab\u00f3licos, pelo que a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o prolongada a um ambiente \u00e1cido, dentro \n\ndos intervalos de proje\u00e7\u00e3o para o final do s\u00e9culo, poder\u00e1 afectar negativamente estas esp\u00e9cies.  \n\n Para a maioria dos organismos marinhos, e particularmente no grupo dos crust\u00e1ceos, os efeitos \n\nde uma exposi\u00e7\u00e3o prolongada e por v\u00e1rias gera\u00e7\u00f5es a concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas de CO2 no meio marinho \n\ns\u00e3o ainda relativamente desconhecidos. Os organismos poder\u00e3o ser capazes de manter a sua performance \n\nnas condi\u00e7\u00f5es futuras dos oceanos, quer atrav\u00e9s de aclimata\u00e7\u00e3o, quer atrav\u00e9s de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o evolutiva. A \n\naclimata\u00e7\u00e3o sup\u00f5e a exist\u00eancia de plasticidade fenot\u00edpica no que diz respeito \u00e0s respostas fisiol\u00f3gicas, \n\n\n\n  VII \n\nmorfol\u00f3gicas ou comportamentais, que auxiliam na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do fitness dos indiv\u00edduos num novo \n\nambiente. Por sua vez, a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o consiste na reten\u00e7\u00e3o nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es por sele\u00e7\u00e3o natural dos \n\ngen\u00f3tipos favor\u00e1veis a um novo ambiente e que leva \u00e0 altera\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura natural das popula\u00e7\u00f5es ao \n\ndirigir o equil\u00edbrio fenot\u00edpico para um novo n\u00edvel \u00f3ptimo em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es encontradas.  \n\n A aclimata\u00e7\u00e3o transgeracional ocorre quando um novo ambiente experienciado por uma gera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npaternal, influencia positivamente a performance da sua descend\u00eancia para esse mesmo ambiente. Por \n\nvezes, \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria uma exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rias gera\u00e7\u00f5es a um determinado factor de stress at\u00e9 que surjam \n\ndiferen\u00e7as significativas nas caracter\u00edsticas de uma esp\u00e9cie entre dois ambientes diferentes. Assim, de \n\nmodo a estudar a forma como a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos poder\u00e1 ou n\u00e3o afectar os organismos no oceano \n\nde amanh\u00e3, s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios estudos trans- e multigeracionais, que abordem esta quest\u00e3o em esp\u00e9cies \n\ncom ciclos de vida curtos e de f\u00e1cil manuten\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\n O presente estudo visou aumentar o conhecimento existente acerca dos efeitos transgeracionais \n\ne da poss\u00edvel adapta\u00e7\u00e3o dos organismos marinhos \u00e0 acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o futura dos oceanos, no que diz respeito \n\n\u00e0 fisiologia e aos processos reprodutivos de anf\u00edpodes gamar\u00eddeos. Neste sentido, foram estabelecidas \n\nduas popula\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais de Gammarus locusta, que foram sujeitas por duas gera\u00e7\u00f5es consecutivas \n\na um cen\u00e1rio de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o com valores estimados para o final do s\u00e9culo (pH= 7.7 e pCO2 = 900 ?atm) \n\ne a um cen\u00e1rio controlo com valores de pH e press\u00e3o parcial de CO2 actuais (pH = 8.1, pCO2 = 400 \n\n?atm). Em ambas as gera\u00e7\u00f5es, foram recolhidos dados relativos a caracter\u00edsticas espec\u00edficas da hist\u00f3ria \n\nde vida desta esp\u00e9cie: i) investimento reprodutor das f\u00eameas (n\u00famero m\u00e9dio de ovos no interior do \n\nmars\u00fapio das f\u00eameas); ii) dura\u00e7\u00e3o da parelha reprodutora (mate-guarding), iii) fecundidade m\u00e9dia; iv) \n\ntempo m\u00e9dio de desenvolvimento embrion\u00e1rio; v) e apenas para a segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o, testes \n\ncomportamentais focados na atra\u00e7\u00e3o de machos por pistas olfativas de f\u00eameas recetivas, e do consumo \n\nm\u00e9dio de oxig\u00e9nio (taxa metab\u00f3lica de rotina). Os resultados do presente estudo mostraram efeitos \n\nsignificativos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos na maioria das caracter\u00edsticas reprodutivas desta esp\u00e9cie. \n\nApesar de uma descida no pH poder, numa primeira inst\u00e2ncia e para a primeira gera\u00e7\u00e3o exposta, \n\nestimular positivamente o investimento reprodutor das f\u00eameas, uma exposi\u00e7\u00e3o transgeracional leva a \n\numa redu\u00e7\u00e3o significativa do n\u00famero de ovos e da fecundidade. A dura\u00e7\u00e3o da parelha reprodutora \n\ntamb\u00e9m foi significativamente afectada, tendo diminu\u00eddo para os casais expostos ao ambiente \n\nacidificado, contudo n\u00e3o foram encontrados efeitos ao n\u00edvel da dura\u00e7\u00e3o do desenvolvimento \n\nembrion\u00e1rio. A sobreviv\u00eancia aos 30 dias de idade foi tamb\u00e9m significativamente afectada, tendo \n\ndiminu\u00eddo em cerca de 19% em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 popula\u00e7\u00e3o controlo e sugerindo a exist\u00eancia de efeitos \n\nmetab\u00f3licos nefastos. Na segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o, foi identificada a presen\u00e7a de depress\u00e3o metab\u00f3lica em \n\norganismos de ambos os sexos, assim como uma perda da acuidade na localiza\u00e7\u00e3o da origem de pistas \n\nreprodutoras de f\u00eameas, aliada ao aumento do tempo de resposta (o estimular de comportamentos \n\nlocomotores de busca) em machos sujeitos a condi\u00e7\u00f5es de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\n No geral, e para as caracter\u00edsticas reprodutivas afectadas, assim como para a sobreviv\u00eancia, \n\nforam encontrados efeitos transgeracionais (parentais) negativos na linhagem acidificada, que sugerem \n\na poss\u00edvel diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do fitness das popula\u00e7\u00f5es naturais de G. locusta num cen\u00e1rio de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfutura dos oceanos. Os efeitos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel do metabolismo, aliados \u00e0 depress\u00e3o metab\u00f3lica \n\nobservada na segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o, ajudam a explicar a maioria dos resultados obtidos e sugerem a exist\u00eancia \n\nde efeitos nefastos da diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do pH (e aumento do pCO2) numa esp\u00e9cie tipicamente considerada \n\ncomo resiliente.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o, transgeracional, evolu\u00e7\u00e3o, comportamento, reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\n \n\n\n\n  VIII \n\n  \n\n\n\n  IX \n\n \n\nIndex \n\n \n1.

Parents influence the phenotype of their offspring through both genetic and non-genetic pathways. The \n\nenvironment experienced by parents can influence the phenotype of their offspring through a variety of non-genetic \n\nmechanisms. In fishes, for instance, these mechanisms include nutritional provisioning of eggs, transfer of hormones or \n\nproteins to eggs, or epigenetic marks from either the mother or the father. Transgenerational acclimation occurs when \n\nthe performance of offspring in a particular environment is improved when parents have experienced the same \n\nenvironment (Munday, 2014)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.6 \n\nTable 1.1.1.

Introduction \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 1.1. Ocean acidification  \n \n\n Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the mid-eighteenth century, the world has \n\nwitnessed geochemical changes that have not been experienced for the last 300 million years (H\u00f6nisch \n\net al., 2012). The release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere by agricultural, industrial, \n\ndeforestation and transportation activities, is a serious concern. Current estimates set concentrations of \n\nthis greenhouse gas higher than they have been for over 800 thousands years, while giving no hint to a \n\npossible decrease in the build-up rates (L\u00fcthi et al., 2008). It is expected that the actual rate of \n\natmospheric CO2 build up will increase in the following years (IPCC, 2014), with concentrations \n\ndisplaying an escalating trend from 280 ?atm (micro atmospheres, pre-industrial) to approximately 400 \n\n?atm (current levels) (Feely et al., 2009, H\u00f6nisch et al., 2012, IPCC, 2014).  \n\n CO2 is one of the most relevant gases in our planet\u2019s atmosphere, being responsible for the \n\ncontrol of both radiative heat balance of the Earth, and the calcium carbonate equilibrium in the oceans \n\nas well (Petit et al., 1999). CO2 levels both in the air and in surface waters tend to equilibrate \u2013 in \n\naccordance with Henry\u2019s Law; as atmospheric partial pressures for this gas increase, leading to the \n\nequivalent dissolution of CO2 (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004). The ocean\u2019s carbonate chemistry is governed by a \n\nseries of abiotic and biologically mediated chemical reactions (see Figure 1.1.1a), which depend on the \n\nstability of abiotic parameters such as ocean temperature and alkalinity. It is the flux of carbon dioxide \n\nbetween the atmosphere and the ocean - which is a function of surface mixing and differences in \n\nconcentration between surface waters and the air \u2013 that keeps the ocean\u2019s carbon chemistry in check, \n\nand maintains a positive environment for current ecological processes, as well as the survival and \n\nmaintenance of fitness-enhancing, physiological and behavioural mechanisms in marine organisms \n\n(Feely et al., 2009, Munday et al., 2013, Sunday et al., 2014).  \n\n Ocean acidification results from the abnormal increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide \n\n(pCO2) in surface waters, which in turn leads to the reduction in mean surface water pH levels (Sunday \n\net al., 2014). The increase in pCO2 is associated with the increased uptake of fossil fuel-derived CO2 \n\nfrom the atmosphere (Orr et al., 2005, Feely et al., 2009, Sunday et al., 2014), which in turn leads to the \n\nunbalancing of normal seawater carbonate chemistry. As pCO2 increases in seawater, there is a \n\nsubsequent increase in the rate of the reactions that form carbonic acid (H2CO3). Most of this acid \n\nnaturally dissociates to form HCO3\n- and H+, and the latter reacts in turn with carbonate ions to produce \n\nadditional bicarbonate ions (see Figure 1.1.1b). This shift in the carbon chemistry, by \u201cinjecting\u201d \n\nincreased quantities of carbon dioxide into the ocean, contributes to the progressive acidification of \n\nseawater, with an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, the associated decline in pH levels, and the \n\nreduction in the concentration of free carbonate ions (Feely et al., 2009), as well as the saturation state \n\nof calcium carbonate minerals. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n This increase in the ocean\u2019s acidity has gradually occurring, translated in a decrease of \n\napproximately 0.1 pH units since the beginning of the industrial era (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003, Orr et \n\nal., 2005, Doney et al., 2009). The majority of OA projections place a future increase of pCO2 from \n\ncurrent levels (~400 ?atm), to approximately 880-990 ppm by the year 2100 (see Figure 1.1.2). This \n\nwould mean an additional decrease of 0.3 pH units coupled with an increase in the ocean\u2019s hydrogen \n\nion concentration of approximately 2.5 times, relative to pre-industrial levels (Caldeira and Wickett, \n\n2003, Friedlingstein and Solomon, 2005, IPCC, 2014), which could pose a serious risk for marine \n\norganisms in the near future, as will be discussed in the next section.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 1.1.2.

Sections in black point out the primary chemical reactions which occur in each scenario.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 1.1.1 Effects of OA on crustaceans and other marine organisms \n\n \n\n General concern about the severe impacts of OA in marine organisms has increased over the \n\npast decades (Orr et al., 2005, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2007, Kroeker et al., 2010, Sunday et al., 2014). \n\nChanges in ocean chemistry associated with OA will elicit both direct and indirect effects in the \n\nphysiological functioning, behaviour and demographic traits of most marine organisms. These effects \n\nwill translate into populational and community level changes - which can ultimately alter the underlying \n\ndynamics that control an ecosystem\u2019s structure and overall function (Doney et al., 2012) \u2013 and \n\nacidification could, therefore, have major impacts on food webs and global geochemical cycles (Orr et \n\nal., 2005, Doney et al., 2009, Feely et al., 2009, Doney et al., 2012).  \n\n It is generally accepted that the degree to which a particular species will be affected by projected \n\nOA will ultimately depend on its physiological performance. When faced with a stressor, organisms \n\ninitially respond with physiological and behavioural adaptations, which are conditioned by their \n\nevolutionary history (Doney et al., 2012, Somero, 2012). If conditions are physiologically tolerable, \n\nindividuals of said species can acclimate or adjust their physiology to cope with the new stressor. As \n\nacclimation at an individual level occurs, then a species may also (but not necessarily) adapt to the new \n\nconditions on the long-term - by increasing both the abundance and the reproductive success of those \n\ngenotypes that are most tolerant to the new conditions - over subsequent generations (Doney et al., 2012, \n\nMunday et al., 2013). If, on the contrary, these conditions prove to be physiologically unfavourable, \n\nindividuals and populations will either promote migration into areas where conditions are more suitable, \n\ninduce changes in phenology and advance or delay certain life-history events, or even face local \n\nextinction events (Parmesan, 2006).  \n\n Depending on species ability to acclimate or adapt to OA, some taxa have been classified as \n\nbeing potentially more vulnerable than others (Whiteley, 2011, Doney et al., 2012). Invertebrates such \n\nas cnidarians, molluscs and echinoderms have been extensively studied for their well-known \n\nvulnerability to changes in the ocean\u2019s chemistry \u2013 for being poor iono-regulators and having a reduced \n\nability to buffer the acidifying effects of high-CO2 concentrations in their body compartments (Fabry et \n\nal., 2008, Doney et al., 2009, Dupont et al., 2010). For these and other groups, OA is known to affect \n\nmany physiological processes and life-history patterns: in calcifying organisms, OA is thought to \n\nincrease the energy costs of calcification (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004, Hofmann et al., 2010, Doney et al., 2012), \n\nand some species have been known to undergo dissolution of their calcified skeletons or suffer \n\nsignificant reductions in their calcification rates, when exposed to acidic environments (Fabry et al., \n\n2008, Whiteley, 2011). Reproduction and metabolism can also be affected, and some species have \n\nshown reduced fertilization success, shorter developmental rates and larval sizes (Kurihara, 2008), and \n\nlower oxygen-binding capacity (O2) of respiratory proteins - thus impairing an individual\u2019s aerobic \n\nscope (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004).   \n\n The effects of OA in marine organisms result from the entry of CO2 by diffusion in the individual \n\nbody, rapidly achieving equilibrium in all body compartments, which then has a predominantly \n\nacidifying effect on an individual\u2019s internal acid-base balance (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004). By causing changes \n\nin one or in a combination of the body compartment\u2019s acid-base parameters, CO2 may affect overall \n\nmetabolic rates, as well as the partitioning of energy between individual metabolic processes (P\u00f6rtner \n\net al., 2004). Disturbances in the acid-base balance can frequently be compensated in order to re-\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nestablish the original or a new equilibrium in the body fluids, and for this purpose, water breathers rely \n\nalmost exclusively on ion exchange mechanisms with the exterior.  \n\n Changes in the ocean\u2019s and the individual\u2019s carbonate chemistry compromise the excretion of \n\nCO2 from the haemolymph, leading to increases in its concentration in the extracellular compartment \n\nand to variations in the haemolymph\u2019s pH levels (Whiteley, 2011). The resulting variation of pH levels \n\nin haemolymph can be buffered by adjusting the body\u2019s acid-base equilibria, maintaining an \n\nenvironment favourable with most protein activity. Rises in intracellular H+ can, however, disrupt \n\nprotein synthesis, iono-regulation, cell volume and overall metabolism. This interferes with organism\u2019s \n\ncapacity to cope with pH disruptions in the haemolymph, as they can only be tolerated to some extent, \n\nbefore causing medium to long term disturbances (Whiteley, 2011). Acid-base balance disruptions both \n\nin extra- and intracellular environments can have far-reaching consequences, compromising survival \n\nand disrupting relevant biological processes such as metabolism and individual growth. Species that are \n\nstrong iono- and osmoregulators, are likely to be most tolerant to OA, because they own the \n\ncompensatory mechanisms that enable them to respond to acid-base disruptions. These species typically \n\ninhabit shallow coastal environments, under freshwater influence, where they experience natural \n\nvariations in abiotic parameters \u2013 i.e. seawater pCO2, pO2, salinity and temperature (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004, \n\nWhiteley, 2011, Kelly and Hofmann, 2013).  \n\n Crustacea have thus been considered a fairly resilient group of species, capable of adjusting to \n\nfuture OA conditions. However, in the past decade, a growing interest on how OA will directly affect \n\nthese intertidal dwellers has shed some light on the subject. Crustaceans are primary and secondary \n\nconsumers, and constitute an important food source for higher trophic levels. As abundant and frequent \n\nliving organisms of intertidal and estuarine areas, which are known to display broad and rapidly \n\nchanging fluctuations of physical factors (Whiteley, 2011), crustaceans also show a wide variety of \n\nresponses to abiotic change \u2013 from active regulation against external changes, to conformation to new \n\nconditions. \n\n The majority of crustacean species are committed water-breathers, in which there is close \n\ncontact with the external environment through specialized structures \u2013 i.e. gills or others equivalent \u2013 \n\nthat are responsible for respiratory gas and ion exchange (Taylor and Taylor, 1992). Despite being more \n\ntolerant to hypercapnia - because they maintain higher HCO3\n- concentration in the haemolymph - acid-\n\nbase adjustments made by crustaceans are likely to be metabolically expensive if exposure to acidified \n\nconditions is prolonged over weeks or months, due to the dependence on bicarbonate (HCO3\n-) ion uptake \n\nfrom the seawater (Whiteley, 2011). If these compensation costs are indeed significant, then it is possible \n\nto infer that crustaceans could be adversely affected by OA, and that the costs will either be limiting and \n\nrestrict homeostatic processes, or energy will be diverted away from other processes, with individual \n\nperformance being affected in both scenarios (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004, Whiteley, 2011).  \n\n There is indeed growing evidence that OA may affect crustacean populations by influencing \n\ngrowth and / or reproductive performance in adults, and in determining life-history traits such as larval \n\ndevelopment and settling (Whiteley, 2011). Some described effects of short-term exposure to high-CO2 \n\nin crustaceans include changes in egg production - e.g. Palaemon pacificus (Kurihara, 2008) - increased \n\nembryonic development duration characterized by a delayed time to hatching \u2013 e.g. Semibalanus \n\nbalanoides (Findlay et al., 2009) \u2013 reduced survival and growth in amphipods \u2013 e.g. Peramphithoe \n\nparmerong (Poore et al., 2013) and Gammarus pulex (Taylor et al., 1994) \u2013 changes in palatability to \n\nfood sources \u2013 e.g. Peramphithoe parmerong (Poore et al., 2013) \u2013and changes in the expression of \n\nmetabolically relevant enzymes in the amphipod Gammarus locusta (Hauton et al., 2009), etc.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n  OA is also known to effectively disrupt chemically-mediated, fitness enhancing behaviours in \n\nboth fish and crustacean groups \u2013 e.g. Pagurus bernhardus (de la Haye et al., 2012), among others \n\n(Briffa et al., 2012). Most results indicate that exposures to CO2 enriched water affect the olfactory \n\nsystem on some level that is not directly linked to the chemical modification of odour cues (Leduc et \n\nal., 2013). Therefore, exposure to high-CO2 (and the resulting hypercapnia) is responsible for the \n\nmajority of observed disruptions in the physiology and behaviour of marine animals, particularly in \n\ncrustaceans, which behaviour can be directly affected by direct interference in acid-base balance \n\nmaintenance (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004, Briffa et al., 2012). Hypercapnia could lead to behavioural changes \n\nthrough a series of processes: i) as a consequence of systemic physiological changes that reduce the \n\nenergy available to the individual or alter its metabolic processes (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004); ii) changes in \n\nneural mechanisms required for processing information (Nilsson et al., 2012); iii) or the disruption of \n\nthe signal reception \u2013 through physical impairment of receptive organs, alteration of the receptors or in \n\nsome situations, changes in the signalling molecules (Briffa et al., 2012).  \n\n The impacts resulting from long-term high-CO2 exposure in crustaceans, and many other marine \n\ngroups, remain relatively unknown (Whiteley, 2011). While some species show negative effects to OA \n\nexposure, others show no measurable effects or are even positively affected by exposure to mid- to high-\n\nCO2 conditions (Whiteley, 2011). Thus, it is highly important to include crustacean species as models \n\nin trans- and multigenerational experiments, to better understand the subtle effects of ocean acidification \n\nthat may be concealed by resilience to short-term exposures.  \n\n \n\n 1.1.2 Trans-/multigenerational approaches on OA  \n\n \n\n When studying the effects of ocean acidification or other environmental stressors on marine \n\norganisms, it is important to consider the potential long-term, evolutionary effects. For some time, \n\nstudies focused on the impact of high-CO2 exposure stress on either \u2018adult individuals\u2019 or \u2018larvae\u2019 \n\n(Parker et al., 2012) and ignored the potential link that exists between different life-history stages and \n\ndifferent generations, and possible effects that might be passed down from adults to their offspring \u2013 \n\nparental effects (see Figure 1.1.3) (Dupont et al., 2010, Kroeker et al., 2010, Parker et al., 2012). \n\n Marine organisms might be able to maintain their performance in future OA conditions either \n\nthrough acclimation or through evolutionary adaptation (Munday, 2014, Sunday et al., 2014, Calosi et \n\nal., 2016). Acclimation involves phenotypically plastic responses at the physiological, morphological or \n\nbehavioural level, which can help maintain individual fitness in a new environment (Sunday et al., 2014). \n\nPhenotypic plasticity is the capacity of one genotype to produce a range of phenotypes under different \n\nenvironmental conditions (Fordyce, 2006), which plays a key role in determining an organism\u2019s fitness \n\nand subsequent ecological performance when challenged with highly selective pressures (Gibbin et al., \n\n2017).  \n\n Adaptation, involves the selection on genetic variation, by retaining favourable genotypes in a \n\npopulation, which in turn alters its structure by shifting the average phenotype towards a new, optimal \n\nfitness peak for the conditions encountered (Sunday et al., 2014). Acclimation, in turn is a short-term \n\nresponse which can either be reversible, developmental or transgenerational. Reversible acclimation \n\noccurs in hours to days or even months, and allows an individual to temporarily adjust its physiology \n\nand behaviour to survive the stress imposed by a sudden change. Developmental acclimation can occur \n\nwhen exposure to a novel environment happens during early-life phases of an individual, enhancing its \n\nability to survive to that same environment later in life. Finally, transgenerational acclimation occurs \n\nwhen the environment experienced by the parent positively influences the performance of the offspring \n\nexposed to that same environment (See Figure 1.1.3). Sometimes, a phenomenon called \u201cphenotypic \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nbuffering\u201d can lead to the apparent absence of differential responses in certain traits, between different \n\nenvironments, but a longer, multigenerational exposure might be enough to elicit clear positive or \n\nnegative responses (Munday, 2014, Sunday et al., 2014). \n\n There is growing consensus that on short ecological time-scales, evolution can occur (Carroll et \n\nal., 2007) - through standing variation or from the appearance of new mutations (Kelly and Hofmann, \n\n2013) - and that adaptation could reduce or compensate the risk of extinction during periods of rapid \n\nenvironmental changes (Bell and Gonzalez, 2009). Both genetic adaptation and acclimation can help \n\norganisms persist in the face of environmental change, and understanding the links between these \n\nprocesses will be critical for predicting the evolutionary responses of marine organisms to OA (Sunday \n\net al., 2014).  \n\n  \n\n A possible approach to measure the scope for adaptation is experimental evolution (Kelly and \n\nHofmann, 2013). In this approach, populations of (typically) short-lived organisms of easy maintenance \n\nin laboratory, are exposed to simulated future conditions over a set of generations, and then are compared \n\nto control populations for the evaluation of possible signs of adaptation. Multi-generational experiments \n\nare needed to anticipate the adaptive capacity of marine organisms over the next century given the \n\ncurrent rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 (The Royal Society, 2005).  \n\n Some of the most recent multigenerational approaches for OA in marine animal groups are \n\nsummarized in Table 1.1.1. Most negative effects that occur at a transgenerational level seem to affect \n\nfecundity, development metabolism and behaviour. Despite the existence of examples of parental effects \n\nor adaptive potential that could alleviate some of these impacts, there are also species that show \n\nincreasingly negative consequences of OA exposure with each subsequent generation. It is still unknown \n\nhow most marine groups will fare in the future, due to intra-group responses being so variable. It is \n\nimportant to conduct broader, longer and more holistic multigenerational experiments, in order to ensure \n\nthe understanding of how marine organisms will change under the selective pressure of future global \n\nchange drivers, and better predict population, community and ecosystem level responses (Calosi et al., \n\n2016).   \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1.3. Parents influence the phenotype of their offspring through both genetic and non-genetic pathways. The \n\nenvironment experienced by parents can influence the phenotype of their offspring through a variety of non-genetic \n\nmechanisms. In fishes, for instance, these mechanisms include nutritional provisioning of eggs, transfer of hormones or \n\nproteins to eggs, or epigenetic marks from either the mother or the father.

Study species: the amphipod Gammarus locusta \n\n  \n \n\n  1.2.1 Distribution and ecology \n\n \n\n Gammarus locusta (Linnaeus, 1758) (Figure 1.2.1) is a relatively known and frequent species \n\nin both coastal and estuarine waters along the North-eastern Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1.2.2), namely from \n\nthe coasts of Norway (Lincoln, 1979a), Iceland (Ing\u00f3lfsson, 1977) and the British Isles (Lincoln, 1979b) \n\n\u2013 to the Baltic and North seas, the Azores Islands, and the Atlantic coasts of France, Spain and Portugal \n\n(Maren, 1975, Costa and Costa, 1999, Costa, 2000, Costello, 2010). In Portugal, its occurrence has been \n\nreported in numerous locations along the coast, such as the Mondego, Sado, Mira, Aveiro and Alvor \n\nestuaries, among others (Costa and Costa, 1999, Neuparth et al., 2002). \n\n  \n\n G. locusta is described as a marine, euryhaline species (Remane and Schlieper, 1958), and has \n\nwon the connotation of being \u00abthe most common, purely marine form in the temperate eastern atlantic \n\nocean\u00bb (Stock, 1967), which even though it is not accurate, this conotation emphazyses the high \n\nabundance of this amphipod. Records on this species\u2019 occurrence indicate that it prefers conditions that \n\nare closer to the open sea (Costa, 2000), but this amphipod still penetrates brackish waters to some extent \n\nand, according to some authors, tolerates considerable reductions in salinity - given that an adequate \n\nacclimation period is provided (Costa, 2000). In fact, individuals are frequently found in the infra- and \n\nintertidal zones, and can endure a wide range of salinities \u2013 from as low as 5 and up to 40 (Costa and \n\nCosta, 1999). They are also able to adapt to very different types of habitats - which include rocky \n\ncoastlines and sandy or muddy substrates, as well as Zostera sp. beds \u2013 as long as these are associated \n\nwith a high coverage of macroalgae (Oliveira Costa et al., 1996, Costa and Costa, 1999, Ruppert, 2004). \n\nThe macroalgae\u2019s structures, and their filamentous and branded epiphytes create a complex \n\nenvironment, which acts as the perfect substrate for shelter and refuge from predators, as well as a food \n\nsource for this gammarid.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2.1. Gammarus locusta (Linnaeus, 1758) \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n  1.2.2 Trophic relationships \n\n  \n\n G. locusta is an omnivorous, opportunistic, deposit-feeder species (Costa and Costa, 2000), \n\nwhose diet includes a variety of different seaweeds and the occasional predation of smaller organisms \n\nor even conspecifics. This species has been shown to consume a variety of food items, and maintains \n\nrelationships of herbivory, detritivory, and cannibalism, both in the wild and in laboratory conditions \n\n(Costa and Costa, 1999, Costa and Costa, 2000, Costello, 2010). Studies have shown that the preferred \n\nfood source for this small amphipod are macroalgae \u2013 such as Ulva spp. and Enteromorpha spp \u2013 which \n\nrepresents the major component of its natural diet, followed by detritus. This preference for algae makes \n\nthis amphipod as an important mesograzer, helping in the suppression of overgrown ephemeral algae, \n\ne.g. in seagrass beds (Andersson et al., 2009).  \n\n This amphipod species is also crucial for higher trophic levels in coastal and estuarine food \n\nwebs, being preyed upon by fish (Kuhlmann et al., 1982), shorebirds, and many other groups like \n\nnemertenians and larger crustaceans (Costa and Costa, 1999, Macneil et al., 1999). Its role as a consumer \n\nand a prey, alongside its wide latitudinal distribution (Figure 1.2.2), range and abundance, contribute to \n\nits high ecological relevance in numerous European coastal systems (Costa and Costa, 2000). \n\n \n\n  1.2.3 Life cycle and reproduction \n\n \n\n Amphipods display a great diversity of life-history patterns (Sundelin et al., 2008) \u2013 e.g. \n\nsemelparity, iteroparity, semi-annual, annual, biannual or perennial life cycles, presence or absence of \n\npre-copulatory mate guarding (MG) behaviours, etc. - that are directly influenced by latitude, depth and \n\nsalinity  (Appadoo and Myers, 2004). Overall, the general life cycle of a gammarid amphipod can be \n\nsummed according to Figure 1.2.3.  \n\nFigure 1.2.2. Distribution of Gammarus locusta in the \n\nNE Atlantic Ocean \u2013 adapted (Costa et al., 2004). \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n In southern areas of its distribution, such as at the Sado estuary, G. locusta exhibits a \n\nmultivoltine life cycle. This means that over a year, a female will produce more than two broods, and \n\nthat reproductive activity is more or less continuous throughout most of this period (Costa and Costa, \n\n1999). The cycle is generally completed in 40 to 50 days, at 15 \u00baC (Neuparth et al., 2002), when \n\nindividuals have achieved sexual maturity, mated, and given birth to a new generation. Increases in \n\ntemperature have been linked to an average four-week reduction in the life-span of G. locusta, as well \n\nas an acceleration and condensation of their life cycle \u2013 which includes the anticipation of the age at \n\nmaturity, and higher population growth rates (Neuparth et al., 2002). \n\n The gender of adult G. locusta is clearly identifiable, since males and females exhibit some \n\ndegree of sexual dimorphism. Males are characterized by the existence of a genital papillae on the \n\nventral surface of the 7th thoracic segment, and can be easily differentiated by their enlarged 2nd pair of \n\ngnathopods. Females, in turn, can be distinguished by the presence of brood plates (i.e. oostegites), \n\nwhich hold the eggs and developing embryos in the ventral area and thus create a brood pouch or \n\nmarsupium. In females, the visual indicator of sexual maturity is the development of setae on the surface \n\nof the brood plates (Sundelin et al., 2008). \n\n In the Sado estuary, females reach maturity at approximately 28 days of age (or 7 mm in length), \n\ndepending on habitat conditions (Costa and Costa, 1999, Hauton et al., 2009), and a female\u2019s investment \n\nin her progeny begins right at oogenesis. In crustaceans, large quantities of lipids are deposited into \n\ndeveloping oocytes \u2013 mainly monounsaturated fatty acids \u2013 which are used during embryo development \n\n(Morais et al., 2002, Rosa et al., 2005). The number of eggs produced by a female varies considerably \n\nbetween different species (Sundelin et al., 2008). For example, G. minus, produce an average of 4 to 9 \n\neggs per female (Glazier et al., 1992), while Gammarus zaddachi is known to produce over one hundred \n\neggs per brood (Cheng, 1942). \n\n Shortly before mating, and following the parturial moult \u2013 i.e. the moult that signals a female\u2019s \n\nmaturity and reproductive availability, with the added development of setae on the brood pouches \u2013 the \n\nfemale\u2019s oocytes are sorted into eggs that will pass down through the oviduct wall and exit into the \n\nfemale\u2019s marsupium (Sutcliffe, 2010b). The passage of the eggs into the brood pouch can only happen \n\nduring a short-time period, after the moult has occurred and the new exoskeleton is still soft, because \n\nthis is the time when the oviduct wall is still malleable enough to conform to the egg\u2019s passage.  \n\nFigure 1.2.3. Life cycle of a Gammarid amphipod.  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nThis reduced window of time created a challenge for amphipod reproduction since, despite the fact that \n\nthe female\u2019s moult, and thus fertility, is predictable, males have few opportunities to find and mate with \n\nfertile females unless they develop a strategy to maximize their probabilities. It is believed that this is \n\nthe reason behind the evolutionary appearance of a precopulatory stage called mate-guarding (MG), in \n\nwhich males will guard and effectively carry a pre-moulting female to ensure their place as the fertilizers \n\nof the eggs \u2013 males will use their enlarged pair of gnathopods to clasp and hold the smaller females until \n\nthey moult (Steele and Steele, 1986). Precopulatory MG can last up to 8 \u2013 10 days, and is dependent on \n\nthe female\u2019s moult and external abiotic conditions (Sutcliffe, 2010b) \n\n When body contact occurs between a mature male and a receptive female, the male will catch \n\nand clasp the female by an appendage and place her lengthwise beneath him, in the position of \n\nprecopulatory amplexus. The male is able to swim whilst carrying the female, which can either remain \n\nin a curled position or straighten her body and contribute to the locomotor activity, by beating her \n\npleopods (Borowsky, 1984, Ward, 1985, Sutcliffe, 2010a). After the eggs have passed through into the \n\nmarsupium, the male rotates the female underneath him so that he can deposit his spermatophores and \n\nhence fertilize the eggs (Sutcliffe, 2010a).  \n\n These processes of male attraction and MG rely on chemosensory information that is transmitted \n\nby means of waterborne chemical signals produced by the females. It has been suggested that secretion \n\nof these hormones happens in two stages: the secretion of a \u201cprimary ovarian hormone\u201d by the ovary\u2019s \n\nprimary follicular cells, which controls the development of the oostegites (Sutcliffe, 2010a); and the \n\nsecretion of a \u201ctemporary ovarian hormone\u201d, at the secondary follicular cells, which controls the \n\ndevelopment of temporary sexual features such as the long ovigerous setae that cover the oostegites \n\nduring vitellogenesis (Sutcliffe, 2010a). \n\n Males use their aesthetascs to detect female pheromones, thus enabling the search for a cue \n\nreleasing female and the initiation of precopulatory behaviours (Gleeson, 1982, Hallberg et al., 1997). \n\nIn some species \u2013 e.g. G. pulex and G. duebeni \u2013 the urine of female\u2019s acts as an attractant solution for \n\nmales in the water column (Dunham, 1978, Borowsky, 1985). The presence of a specific pheromone, \n\nprobably ecdysone or ecdysterone - which control the impending moult in the female and hence signals \n\nthe short fertility period (Ducruet, 1975) \u2013 or a mixture of substances produced at the same time, is \n\nsuggested to be the vehicle of this attraction (Hammoud et al., 1975).  \n\n In Gammarus, attraction is present in two different levels: on long distances \u2013 by means of a \n\nlong distance pheromone, probably present in the female\u2019s urine; and on short distances \u2013 by means of \n\na body contact pheromone, secreted in the female\u2019s exoskeleton. While the first is able to operate at a \n\ndistance to attract nearby males (Dahl et al., 1970, Borowsky, 1985, Borowsky and Borowsky, 1987), \n\nthe second is released in the female\u2019s external body cuticle and elicits courtship and MG behaviour in \n\nmales (Sutcliffe, 2010a). In 1985, Borowsky demonstrated the existence of long-distance sexual \n\nattraction in Gammarus palustris, showing that when males were exposed to cues from conspecifics and \n\ncongenerics in different maturity stages, in binary choice Y-mazes, they were \u00abmore often attracted to \n\nreceptive females\u00bb, compared to non-receptive females and other males (Borowsky, 1985). The effect \n\nof other cues (e.g. from fish, invertebrates, algae and from the environment) as attractants and repellents \n\non gammarid amphipods has also been described (Williams and Moore, 1985). \n\n At ambient conditions, embryonic development \u2013 spanning from egg incubation to post-hatch \n\njuveniles \u2013 has been described to last from 15 to 18 days (Neuparth et al., 2002, Maranh\u00e3o and Marques, \n\n2003, Sutcliffe, 2010a). For a couple of days, post-hatch juveniles are able to move freely in and out of \n\nthe female\u2019s marsupium, and begin taking chances in feeding outside the brood pouch. Juvenile \n\ndevelopment until adulthood takes 6 to 7 weeks at 15 \u00baC, and it is estimated that G. locusta life span can \n\nreach from 6 months (Neuparth et al., 2002) to a full year (Ruppert, 2004).  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n2. Objectives          \n \n\n \n\n The objective of the present dissertation was to investigate for the first time the transgenerational \n\neffects of OA exposure (pCO2 = 800-900 ?atm) on the physiology, behaviour and reproductive \n\nprocesses of a gammarid amphipod \u2013 G. locusta. Understanding how reproductive traits and \n\nmetabolism, may or may not be impacted by environmental change, and whether these effects are carried \n\nthroughout subsequent generations, will allow us to infer about the sustainability of amphipod \n\npopulations in an acidified ocean. Within this context, I hypothesised that this scenario could lead to: \n\n 1. Reduction in MG behaviour duration due to metabolic stress; \n\n 2. Decrease in female investment in reproduction (number of eggs per female) as a result of \n\n energy reallocation;  \n\n 3. Negative effects on fecundity (number of surviving juveniles per female); \n\n 4. Decreased survival into adulthood;  \n\n 5. Disruption of male chemosensory reception / attraction to female waterborne pheromones; \n\n 6. Negative effects on the amphipod\u2019s aerobic metabolic rates induced by physiological stress.  \n\n The transgenerational analysis between two successive generations (parental F0 and F1) allowed \n\nto test hypothesis 1 through 4. Chemosensory disruption and the possibility of metabolic alteration \n\n(hypothesis 5 and 6) were tested only on the F1 generation, due to constraints on setup availability and \n\noptimization.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n3. Materials and Methods         \n \n\n \n\n 3.1. Amphipod collection and stock maintenance \n \n\n A stock culture of G. locusta was established using a mix of individuals collected in the wild \n\nfrom a clean site in the South margin of the Sado Estuary (38\u00b027?N,08\u00b043?W), Portugal, and others from \n\na pre-existing culture, originally collected in the same estuary, and kindly provided by the \n\nInterdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR). The sampling site has been \n\npreviously used by other authors for amphipod sampling and collection (see Figure 3.1.1), and has been \n\nreferenced as a relatively non-contaminated, clean site, with high biological diversity (Costa and Costa, \n\n1999, Neuparth et al., 2002, Martinez-Haro et al., 2016).  \n\n The collection process included the gathering of large macroalgae clusters, and the scrapping of \n\nthe first layers of sandy sediment in the intertidal area at low tide, to ensure recovery for the maximum \n\npossible number of individuals. The algae and sand were thoroughly washed and stored in coolers for \n\ntransportation with enough water and aeration. Upon arrival at the Laborat\u00f3rio Mar\u00edtimo da Guia \n\n(LMG), in Cascais, these were washed and sorted, and all material processed to ensure collection of the \n\nmaximum number of live individuals of the target amphipod species, for stock reinforcement. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n All stocks were kept under stable conditions similar to those found in their natural environment, \n\nand the same physico-chemical conditions were applied in the control treatments during the \n\nexperimental phase (See Table 3.1.1). Individuals were left to acclimate to laboratorial conditions for at \n\nleast two generations (approximately 60-70) days. \n\nFigure 3.1.1. Geographic location of the Sado estuary and the \n\nsampling site, indicated by a black circle (Costa and Costa, \n1999) \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nTable 3.2.1. Seawater physiochemical parameters in all experimental setups. Temperature, salinity and pH were measured daily \n\nand averaged per replicate and per treatment. Total alkalinity (TA) and pCO2 were quantified using the CO2SYS software. \n\nValues represent mean \u00b1 SD.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n A continuous, fresh supply of green algae (Ulva sp.) was maintained and fish flakes were added \n\nonce a week as nutritional enrichment, following Costa (1996), who showed that the use of this \n\nsupplement stimulated individual growth rates and reduced cannibalism in ex-situ populations (Costa \n\nand Costa, 2000). Stocks were filled with a 2 cm layer of sandy substrate and rocks and small PVC pipes \n\nto simulate natural shelter. Water was continuously aerated and was fully replaced at least two times a \n\nweek.  \n\n \n\n 3.2. OA exposure \n \n\n OA experimental design followed the guidelines of experimental design for acidification \n\nresearch (Cornwall and Hurd, 2016). The flow-through aquatic systems were set in order to maintain \n\ntotal alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon speciation due to bacterial activity and acidification of \n\ntreatments, and the setup consisted in two 20 L tank setups (5 independent replicate tanks per treatment). \n\nF0 gammarids were exposed to the following experimental conditions: i) control scenario (18 \u00b0C, pH \n\n8.0, 300-400 \u00b5atm); and ii) hypercapnic scenario (18 \u00b0C, pH 7.7, 800-900 \u00b5atm). The values chosen for \n\npH and pCO2 levels for the control and acidified groups were defined according to relevant climate \n\nchange projections (Doney et al., 2012, IPCC, 2014), and temperature was kept constant at mean annual \n\nvalues for the individual\u2019s area of origin in the Sado estuary Table 3.2.1. pH levels were adjusted \n\nautomatically, via solenoid valves, using the Profilux controlling system (Profilux 3.1, GHL, Germanry) \n\nconnected to individual pH probes, which monitored values every 2 seconds and lowered \n\nthe pH by injection of a certified CO2 gas mixture (Air Liquide, Portugal) via air stones, or upregulated \n\nby aerating the tanks. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGeneration Treatment Temperature (\u00ba C) Salinity pH TA (\u00b5mol/kgSW)* pCO2 (\u00b5atm)* \n\nF0 \nC 18,3 \u00b1 1,3 35 8,09 \u00b1 0,07 1932,24 \u00b1 109,83 375,86 \u00b1 67,73 \n\nA 18,4 \u00b1 1,4 35 7,74 \u00b1 0,12 1971,54 \u00b1 64,26 827,52 \u00b1 73,19 \n\nF1 \n\nCC 18,8 \u00b1 0,8 35 8,01 \u00b1 0,10 2126,45 \u00b1 112,34 354,15 \u00b1 28,68 \n\nAA 18,8 \u00b1 0,6 35 7,68 \u00b1 0,09 2044,07 \u00b1 140,38 825,48 \u00b1 71,47 \n\nAC 18,7 \u00b1 0,6 35 8.02 \u00b1 0.06 2105,65 \u00b1 108,93 366,78 \u00b1 20,54 \n\nCA 18,8 \u00b1 0,6 35 7,69 \u00b1 0,12 1943,55 \u00b1 88,44 803,18 \u00b1 27,82 \n\n \n\nParameter Conditions \n\nTemperature 18 \u00b1 0.5 \u00baC \n\npH | pCO2 8.0 \u00b1 0.5 | ~400  ?atm \n\nPhotoperiod 12h light : 12h dark \n\nSalinity  35 \u00b1 0.5 \n\nTable 3.1.1. Abiotic conditions chosen for stock maintenance.   \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n Recording of temperature, salinity and pH was performed daily. The quantification of pH in the \n\nreplicate tanks was determined using a pH meter (826 pH mobile, Metrohm, Germany) connected to a \n\nglass electrode (Schott IoLine, SI analytics), calibrated with TRIS-HCI (TRIS) and 2-aminopyridine-\n\nHCl (AMP) (Mare, Belgium) seawater buffers. Seawater carbonate system speciation (SCSS) was \n\nquantified following the same method described in Repolho et al. (2017). SCSS was calculated from \n\nTA (total alkalinity, measured by spectrophotometry at 595 nm) and pH measurements. Values of \n\nbicarbonate and pCO2 were calculated using the CO2SYS software (Carbon Dioxide Information \n\nAnalysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA), with dissociation constant, as refitted.  \n\n Temperature inside the tanks was kept constant by partial immersion in a large bath, supplied \n\nwith water that was conditioned by a chiller and thermostats to the desired levels. The tanks were \n\nilluminated from above with white fluorescent lamps, with a fixed photoperiod of 12 h light and 12 h \n\ndark). Daily water renewal for each replicate was calculated to be approximately 10 times its volume. \n\n \n\n 3.3. Transgenerational design \n \n\n The transgenerational experimental design is summarized in Figure 3.3.1.  \n\n Thirty MG couples were randomly selected from the stock tanks at the beginning of the \n\nexperimental phase. These individuals were maintained in two 60-L tanks (15 couples for each \n\ntreatment) and gradually acclimated to the desired treatment conditions (i.e. pH was maintained at 8.0 \n\nfor the controls and decreased gradually by 0.1 units per day in the acidified treatments, until reaching \n\nthe target pH). This procedure guaranteed that the first generation (F0 or paternal generation) was \n\nconceived and developed already under the respective treatment conditions and, as such, exposure to \n\neach pH level was assured since shortly before the beginning of the embryonic development.   \n\n Following acclimation, normal gestation was allowed to continue with removal of the males \n\nfrom the pre-F0 population after the end of the MG behaviour. Upon birth and exit from the mother\u2019s \n\nbrood pouch, new-borns were randomly sorted into the 4-L replicate tanks (Figure 3.3.2). A total of 25 \n\nnew-borns were randomly placed into each treatment\u2019s 5 replicates.  \n\nFigure 3.3.1. Global experimental design: after ensuring 60 to 70 days of stock acclimation, the last new-born individuals were \n\nleft to develop and reach maturity. These individuals would be separated into two groups: one control and one acidified, which \n\nwould then constitute the parental generation (F0). The progeny resulting of the intra-group reproduction would be separated, \n\nwith half being subjected to the same treatment conditions as their progenitors, and the other subjected to conditions of the \n\nopposing treatment.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n Each experimental generation was reared from juvenile to sexual maturity (approximately 30 \n\ndays of age). After this period, sampling of reproductive, behavioural and metabolic outputs (i.e. the \n\nlatter only for the F1 generation, as previously mentioned) took place, with the collection of new-borns \n\nto ensure the establishment of the following generation. Population size depended on youngling \n\nrecruitment, and replicates were populated with 25 new-born F1 individuals. \n\n \n\n 3.4. Reproductive traits \n \n\n 3.4.1 Reproductive traits \n\n \n\n Reproductive outputs were measured continuously upon each generation\u2019s pre-reproductive \n\nphase. Starting at approximately 20 days of exposure, when overall size, behaviour and sexual \n\ndimorphism indicated that individuals would soon reach maturity, tanks were checked twice a day for \n\nrecently formed pre-copulatory MG couples. When identified, these couples were separated from the \n\ngroup and placed into transparent plastic cups (220-mL) filled with their respective replicate\u2019s water. \n\nThis allowed for an accurate measurement of the desired outputs and also helped to minimize the risk \n\nof cannibalism of females by other extra-couple individuals or aggressiveness interfering with mating \n\nand embryonic development. After couple separation, males were quickly removed from the cups and \n\nreintroduced into their original population. The time (in days) from MG initiation until separation was \n\nregistered. Afterwards, approximately half of the ovigerous females were sacrificed for determination \n\nof female investment, while the other half was allowed to complete gestation, with measurement of \n\nembryonic development time and fecundity. A total of 146 females (50 ? in F0 and 96 ? in F1) and 61 \n\nmales (for the MG duration output) were sampled.  \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Female investment   \n\n \n\n Given the difficulty of isolating a female prior to reaching sexual maturity, without resorting to \n\ninvasive and time consuming morphological analysis (due to the apparent similarities between immature \n\nfemales and young females, and to the lack of synchronization in female\u2019s reproductive cycles), only \n\novigerous females possessing fertilized eggs were sampled. Investment was then accounted as the total \n\nnumber of eggs present in the marsupium of a gravid female, after MG behaviours had ceased and the \n\ncouple had separated.  \n\nFigure 3.3.2. Schematic (left) and photograph (right) of the 4 L replicate tanks used in the setup. In the photograph, the tubes \n\nwhich conducted water from the mixture tanks by gravity can be observed, as well as the stones and PVC pipes placed above \n\nthe substrate for shelter and the small clusters of Ulva sp. supplied for both shelter and nutrition.  \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n Previous trials demonstrated that females could be anesthetized either via short time exposure \n\nto low temperatures or carbonated water (Sundelin et al., 2008), followed by lateral and ventral \n\nphotography and consequent egg count with ImageJ. This allowed females to be returned to their \n\nrespective population, preventing their sacrifice, and even allow for a direct comparison between a \n\nfemale\u2019s investment and the total number of younglings that reached the end of their embryonic \n\ndevelopment. However, comparisons between photographic data and data from the sacrifice of a number \n\nof females showed a disparity of over 60% in the total number of eggs. As such, in order to ensure a \n\ncorrect measurement of the number of eggs inside the brood pouch, females were sacrificed by freezing \n\n(-80 \u00baC) shortly after the parting of the male. \n\n After sacrifice, a female\u2019s marsupium would be gently scrapped using a blunt laboratory \n\ntweezer, in the anterior-posterior direction. This allowed for efficient egg removal and minimized \n\npotential egg damage or loss (Figure 3.4.2) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4.3 Embryonic development and Fecundity  \n\n \n\n To estimate the average duration of embryonic development, the amount of time (in days) \n\nspanning from oviposition and male fertilization, to the exit of all juveniles in the female\u2019s brood pouch \n\nwas registered. Females with recently fertilized eggs were kept separated from the rest of the population, \n\nand maintained in plastic cups until eventual youngling departure. Small pieces of algae were supplied \n\nto ensure enough food was available for the female and her progeny, thus minimizing losses by maternal \n\ncannibalism.  \n\n When the marsupium appeared empty, water from the cups was processed and juveniles \n\nseparated from the females. Female fecundity was accounted as the number of juveniles released per \n\nfemale in each replicate (Maranh\u00e3o and Marques, 2003). Following separation from their mother, \n\njuveniles were counted and pooled in small tanks per replicate, in preparation for the next experimental \n\ngeneration.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.4.2.

The chosen experimental \n\nsetup (Figure 3.5.1) was based on a system that was firstly described in 1913, and developed to study \n\nthe response of fishes to different levels of dissolved O2 and CO2 (Shelford and Allee, 1913). Since then, \n\nthis design has been used and adapted by several authors to test chemical preference and avoidance in \n\nmarine organisms (Hall et al., 1982, Hall et al., 1984, Pinkney et al., 1985, Dempsey, 2009) \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n A 60 x 20 cm rectangular arena, with a water depth of 3 cm, was used (Figure 3.5.2). A single \n\nindividual was placed in the choice arena, where it would be able to swim freely between two opposing \n\nwater masses (i.e. one containing female scent cues to incite a males\u2019 response, and other corresponding \n\nto clean filtered seawater). The water masses were continuously supplied, in a flow through manner, by \n\ntwo 20 L header tanks, in which cues had been prepared for at least 48 hours prior to trials, by leaving \n\nthe highest possible number of adult females in a tank to release odours (e.g. urine and pheromones) \n\ncapable of attracting males. A drain, placed at the centre of the starting zone, allowed a constant water \n\nheight while ensuring that both cue flows continuously drained away, hence creating two opposing water \n\ncurrents. As mentioned, one header tank was filled with normal filtered seawater, while the other was \n\nfilled with water from the same source and populated with 30 to 35 stock adult females. Both header \n\ntanks were continuously aerated. Amphipod males were tested in the respective treatment-conditioned \n\nwater. The possibility that acidified water would damage or degrade the female cues involved in male \n\nattraction was accounted for.   \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Preliminary testing was performed for setup optimization, in order to establish optimum flow \n\nrates to prevent mixture between the two water masses (See Figure 3.5.3 and Video 1 in supplemental). \n\nThese tests consisted on the definition of a specific flow and by visual analysis using a blue dye (food \n\ncolouring).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Following setup optimization, an amphipod\u2019s position after being released from the starting \n\ncompartment could be accurately determined \u2013 association zone A or B \u2013 with minimum error. The \n\nstarting zone was used to randomly assign the position of the starting compartment in each arena, and \n\nto minimize possible biases and uncontrolled variables that could interfere with the water flow and hence \n\nprevent a confident analysis of the first seconds of trial run following release. Each trial consisted of a \n\ntotal run time of 20 minutes: 10 minutes acclimation and initial exposure, and 10 minutes of free \n\nmovement inside the arena. Amphipods were placed in small perforated holding containers inside the \n\nstarting zone, to acclimate to the water flow and overall surroundings. Acclimation duration was decided \n\nafter preliminary trials, as it ensured a minimum exposure to the cues to allow for initial stimulation. \n\nAfter 10 minutes, the containers were lifted one by one, and the amphipod\u2019s movements were recorded \n\nwith a video camera for posterior analysis. A total of 24 adult males from the F1 generation (12 per main \n\ntreatment, 2 to 3 per treatment) were randomly selected from the replicate tanks and tested two times, \n\nwith cue input reversal. The response time of an amphipod \u2013 the time required for it to start moving \u2013 \n\nas well as first choice of direction and cumulative time (i.e. the mean proportion of time spent in the \n\npresence of the female cue, compared to the total amount of time spent in both association zones) were \n\nFigure 3.5.2 Overhead view of the binary-choice arenas.  \n\na) b) c) \n\nFigure 3.5.3. Blue dye test for setup optimization. (a) 0 sec; (b) 600 sec; (c) 1200 sec. During trials, and as demonstrated in the \n\nvideo in supplemental, after 20 minutes of cue input there was no mixture of the water masses in either association zone. Larger \n\nversion included in appendix 9.1.  \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nregistered. Out of the 24 males used in these trials only those that met the following requirements were \n\nincluded for the statistical analysis: i) an individual\u2019s initial response time was less than one minute \n\n(60s); ii) a male\u2019s first choice for direction of movement was clearly defined (i.e. the male did not move \n\nto the centre drain, and instead chose one of the association zones); iii) an individual spent at least 7 \n\nminutes (70% of the total trial time) exhibiting active searching or exploratory behaviours.  \n\n \n\n 3.6 Routine Metabolic Rate (RMR) \u2013 Oxygen consumption  \n  \n\n Measurements of routine metabolic rate (O2 consumption rate) were used to address possible \n\neffects of OA on amphipod\u2019s metabolic fitness. RMR is an ecologically relevant measure of metabolism, \n\nthat is applied in situations when an animal\u2019s locomotor activity cannot be completely controlled (i.e. \n\nthe animal is neither completely still, nor completely active during measures) (Ikeda, 2016). The design \n\nconsisted of a static, intermittent flow-through respirometry system (Clark et al., 2013) and is \n\nrepresented in Figure 3.6.1. The dimensions and volume of the chamber (Vchamber + tubbing = 90 mL) were \n\ndefined according to the average individual size of G. locusta, so that a large individual could easily be \n\naccommodated in a static position. At the same time, the combined volume of chamber plus tubbing \n\nwas small enough to allow a correct measurement of individual amphipod\u2019s O2 consumption rate, \n\nwithout it mixing with background respiration noise \u2013 the possible consumption by microorganisms in \n\nthe water column.  \n\n Oxygen measurements were achieved by attaching a small sensor spot (thin sheet of material \n\ncoated in relevant O2 sensing chemicals), on the inside of one of the transparent faces of the cylindrical \n\nchambers. A fibre-optic sensor was attached in the same area on the outside of the chamber, which \n\nmeasured small changes in the sensor spot material\u2019s colour, which reacted to the amount of dissolved \n\noxygen in the water volume. Recirculation was needed in order to prevent water stratification that could \n\npotentially bias measurements: this was achieved by using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S\u00ae series), \n\nwhich ensured a continuous flow of approximately 40 ml min -1. The entire system was submerged in a \n\nbath of oxygenated and previously conditioned water to the desired pH and temperature levels.  \n\nFigure 3.6.1. Schematics of the static, intermittent flow respirometry system used in for the assessment of oxygen consumption \n\nrates in G. locusta.

White arrows represent permanent water \n\ncirculation ensured by the peristaltic pump; Blue arrows represent intermittent path of flush of oxygenated water.  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n  \n\n Each amphipod was gently introduced into one sealed acrylic chamber, following sensor \n\ncalibration in O2 saturated water, and then left for 40 minutes to acclimate to the chamber with \n\nrecirculating water. Following acclimation, a 5-minute flush with oxygenated water from the bath \n\nsignalled the start of a 25-minute measurement period, and was performed by means of a flush pump. \n\nEach flush ensured that O2 levels inside the chamber returned to start values, and the run-time of 25 \n\nminutes ensured that they never fell below 80% air saturation levels (Hughes, 1973, Clark et al., 2013). \n\nA total of 3 flushes (three replicate measurements) were made for each individual and no individual was \n\nused twice. Both acclimation and measurement periods were based on Ramus &amp; Forward (2011), who \n\nmeasured oxygen uptake rates in the amphipod Talorchestia longicornis. In order to ensure proper \n\nacclimation to the chamber and to the respirometry system, an acclimation time of 40 minutes was \n\nconsidered for G. locusta. A total of 28 individuals (14 per treatment) were sampled using this \n\nmethodology. Efforts were made to ensure that amphipods remained not stressed for the majority of run \n\ntime, to minimize the possible disturbance of O2 gradients, or peaks of activity (Clark et al., 2013): tests \n\nwere conducted under reduced lighting and the experimenter\u2019s movements next to the respirometry \n\nsystem were minimized and concealed from the animal\u2019s view, in order to reduce possible stress-induced \n\nmovements.  \n\n Oxygen consumption during each 25-minute run was logged in Pyro Oxygen Logger \n\nSoftware\u00ae. After each test, the individual amphipod\u2019s wet weight (WW) was determined to the nearest \n\n1e-5 g, by removing excess water with paper towelling for 5 to 10 seconds, and then transferring them \n\nto a tared petri-dish (Halcrow and Boyd, 1967). Sex as well as a qualitative measure of the animal\u2019s \n\nactivity during trials were registered. Data from animals that were apparently stressed was not taken into \n\nconsideration. Determination of mass-specific RMR (\u00b5mol O2 g\n-1 h-1) is widely common in fish and can \n\nalso be applied to molluscs and crustaceans (Clark et al., 2013), according to the formula presented \n\nbelow. \n\n \n\n3.6.1. Routine Metabolic Rate (\u00b5mol O2 g-1 H-1) =\n[(?????)???2]\n\n?? (?)? ?? (?)\n \n\n \n\n The slope of oxygen consumption for each 25-minute registry period was calculated by applying \n\na linear regression to the continuous raw trace (?O2/?t), and only slope regressions with coefficients (R2) \n\ngreater than 0.90 were used. Given that an individual\u2019s volume (Vf) did not constitute over 5% the total \n\nvolume of the chamber + tubbing (Vr), the individual volume was discarded for all calculations. \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n4. Data analysis  \n \n\n \n\n For all reproductive outputs, intra-generation and intra-treatment comparisons, as well as cross-\n\ntreatment comparisons were performed to evaluate transgenerational effects of ocean acidification, and \n\npossible carry-over effects.  \n\n In behavioural and metabolic outputs, results concern only the main acidified (AA) and main \n\ncontrol treatments (CC) from the F1 generation and, thus, no transgenerational analysis is performed.  \n\n Important terminology used for the analysis, and which will be used in the results and discussion \n\nsections follows: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Analysis of reproductive outputs was performed via generalized linear models (GLM) using the \n\nPoisson family of distribution. When Poisson over dispersion was different than 1, the family of \n\ndistribution was changed to Negative Binomial (dispersion higher than 1) or to Quasipoisson (dispersion \n\nsmaller than 1), and model definitions adjusted accordingly. Behavioural outputs were also analysed \n\nwith resort to GLM, with the appropriate families of distribution: Gaussian (response time), Gamma \n\n(cumulative time) and Binomial (first choice). Oxygen consumption rates were analysed via GLMs for \n\ncontinuous variables (Gaussian).  \n\n For all models, \u00abGeneration\u00bb, \u00abTreatment\u00bb, and \u00abReplicate\u00bb and, in the behavioural trials, \n\n\u00abTest\u00bb and \u00abIndividual\u00bb were included as factors, to account for intrinsic variability in random effects \n\nanalysis. The best model for each output was ultimately chosen with resource to the calculation of the \n\nAkaike Information Criterion (AIC) \u2013 as a rule, the best model was the one which featured the smallest \n\nAIC. All data analysis was performed in RStudio Software (Version 1.0.143\u2013 \u00a9 2009-2016 RStudio, \n\nInc.) \n\n \n\n  \n\nMain \n\ntreatments \n\nCross \n\ntreatments \n\nC \u2013 Individuals reared in control conditions, whose progenitors came from stock populations \n\nA \u2013 Individuals reared in acidified conditions, whose progenitors came from stock populations.  \n\nAA \u2013 Individuals reared in acidified conditions, and whose progenitors were also reared in acidification  \n\nCC \u2013 Individuals reared in control conditions, and whose progenitors were also reared in control  \n\n \n\nCA \u2013 individuals reared in acidified conditions, whose progenitors were reared in the control treatment.  \n\nAC \u2013 individuals reared in control conditions, whose progenitors were reared in the acidification treatment.  \n\n \n\nF0 \n\nF1 \n\nF1 \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n5.

Discussion \n \n\n \n\n 6.1. Survival \n \n\n High-CO2 was responsible for causing a significant decline in the survival of G. locusta after 30 \n\ndays under experimental conditions. In the parental generation, survival decreased from approximately \n\n75-80% in the control group, to approximately 60-65% in the acidified treatment. For the same species, \n\nHauton et al., (2009) reported similar survival rates (~65%) after a 25-day exposure to a 7.8 pH. The \n\nfact that survival in F1-CA was similar to the acidified treatment in F0 and was significantly lower \n\ncompared to both F1-CC and their parent generation treatment F0-CC, reinforce evidence that within-\n\ngeneration decrease in pH levels (acclimation exposure) significantly reduces survival for this \n\namphipod. There was also evidence for the existence of parental effects in the cross from the acidified \n\ninto the control conditions in F1 (F1-AC). Survival for this group was significantly lower than both the \n\nF1-AA and F1-CC treatments, and was similar to F1-CA. Although on F1 comparisons, the F1-AA \n\ntreatment did not exhibit differences regarding the control group, this did not hint at a possible \n\ntransgenerational acclimation by prolonged exposure. The absence of differences under OA between \n\nboth generations, suggests that survival could be significantly reduced on a transgenerational level.  \n\n Decreases in survival could be related to impacts of OA on calcification and metabolism \n\n(Kroeker et al., 2010), which could result in altered energy allocation and consequent fitness reduction. \n\nPrevious multigenerational studies have shown varied survival responses to OA in invertebrates. In the \n\ncalanoid copepod, Acartia tsuensis, exposure to OA for two generations revealed no clear impact on \n\nsurvival (Kurihara, 2008). In the oyster Saccostrea glomerata, despite short-term transgenerational \n\nexposure to OA led to decreases in survival (Parker et al., 2012), prolonged exposure revealed the \n\nexistence of positive carry-over effects, with larvae and juveniles exhibiting increased resilience (Parker \n\net al., 2015). It is possible that a multigenerational exposure to OA could reveal the existence of positive \n\ncarry-over effects regarding survival.  \n\n \n\n 6.2. Reproductive traits \n \n\n  6.2.1 Mate-guarding \n\n  \n\n The significant reduction of the duration of precopulatory MG in the first acidified generation \n\n(both in F0-AA; and in F1-CA), suggests that first-generation acclimation to high-CO2 conditions could \n\naffect precopulatory behaviour and reproductive success in G. locusta.  \n\n The comparison of F1-CA with its parent group, as mentioned above, emphasises the short-term \n\neffects of acidification that significantly reduced the duration of MG behaviours. The other parental \n\ncross, F1-AC, showed that despite being reared in control conditions, the progeny of acidified \n\nindividuals still exhibited shorter-duration MG periods. This hints at the presence of parental effects that \n\nare not alleviated nor worsened by a return to normocapnic conditions. Also, the significant differences \n\nbetween both first-generation exposure to high-CO2 treatments (F0-AA and F1-CA), although initially \n\nunexpected, don\u2019t go against these assumptions, since MG duration was shorter in F1-CA.  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n Shorter MG duration could be related with increased metabolic costs under OA. There is \n\nevidence that in Gammarus sp., males that are in poor energetic condition may be less able to pay the \n\nenergetic costs associated with precopulatory mate-guarding (Plaistow et al., 2003). Hence, acidified \n\nmales could be investing in shorter-duration MG behaviour, with the possible trade-off of increasing the \n\nprobability of losing the role as the fertilizer of the eggs (i.e. if a male leaves the female before \n\nfertilization occurs), as a response to metabolic stress. Another possibility could be the reduction of \n\nparturial moult duration in pre-mature females - thus allowing shorter but still effective MG by males. \n\nHowever, sustained decreases in ocean pH of at least 0.5 units have already been proved to have no \n\nsignificant impacts in the moulting cycle of G. locusta (Hauton et al., 2009), suggesting the former \n\nhypothesis is the most probable one. \n\n  \n\n  6.2.2 Female investment and fecundity \n\n \n\n First-generational exposure to high-CO2 resulted in a significantly larger investment by females \n\nin the mean number of eggs of the first brood (for both F0-AA and F1-CA). Positive stimulation of egg \n\nproduction in response to high-CO2 induced stress is known to occur in crustaceans (Schade et al., 2014), \n\nalthough this stressor frequently induces either an effective decrease in female investment per brood, or \n\nno effects at all (Kroeker et al., 2010). Transgenerational exposure to high-CO2, however, revealed a \n\npronounced decrease in egg production in F1-AA, compared to its parent treatment and to the F1-CC. \n\nThis could imply that the physiological stress felt since birth or transmitted through the maternal line \n\n(possibly energetic trade-offs) not only led to a decrease in egg production regarding their parental \n\ntreatment, but also resulted in an overall reduction in the number of eggs compared to the control group \n\nin F1.  \n\n The F1-AC treatment produced a mean number of eggs per brood similar to both F1 acidified \n\nand control groups. This suggests that negative effects of acidification have been introduced into the F1 \n\ngeneration during either egg or embryo development (early in life, and possibly through maternal \n\neffects) and were not necessarily alleviated by transfer into control conditions. It is possible that some \n\nmaternal effects are being transferred from F0 to F1. The fact that F1-AC and F1-AA had similarly \n\nreduced female investment suggests that their individual fitness was affected on some level, either during \n\negg formation (in egg quality) or during embryonic development.  \n\n Egg number dropped from F0 to F1 for both the acidified and control groups, for reasons that \n\nare unknown. This overall drop in egg count helps to explain why no significant differences were found \n\nbetween F1-CA and F0-CC, as was expected, despite the former clearly exhibited a higher egg \n\nproduction regarding F1-CC. The magnitude of decrease between F0 and F1 for both main treatments \n\nwas, however, different. In the acidified group, the mean egg number was reduced by approximately \n\n20%, while in the control treatment, the decrease was only of 10%.  \n\n Concerning fecundity, OA did not produce immediate effects (positive or negative) to F0-AA, \n\nbut, in the second generation, a significant decrease was observed for the main acidified treatment. This \n\nis consistent with a multigenerational study on the copepod Acartia sp., which exhibited a consistent \n\ndecrease on egg hatching success over subsequent generations exposed to high-CO2 (Vehmaa et al., \n\n2016). Another study, also on a copepod species (i.e. Pseudocalanus acuspes), found that second \n\ngeneration adults exhibited a 29% decrease in fecundity at 900 ?atm, compared to control conditions \n\n(Thor and Dupont, 2015).  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n The absence of effects in F0-AA for this reproductive trait suggests that the increased egg \n\nproduction was enough to ensure that mean fecundity remained at \u201cnormal\u201d or control levels. However, \n\nincreased investment did not result in increased fecundity. In the F1 generation, mean fecundity suffered \n\na significant drop, concomitant with the decline in egg investment for the same treatment. It is possible \n\nthat the metabolic costs associated with the accumulated effects of two-generation exposure could have \n\nled to a temporary shift in the allocation of energy resources that would normally be used for \n\nreproduction, i.e., the female investment in the number of mature oocytes that are deposited as eggs in \n\nthe brood pouch and, possibly, egg quality (Neuparth et al., 2002). \n\n Similar fecundity levels were expected between F0-CC and F1-CA, following the trend \n\nestablished by the high-CO2 group in F0 (F0-AA), but this was not the case. Nonetheless, mean fecundity \n\nwas still significantly higher than the same generation\u2019s main acidified treatment (F1 AA), as expected, \n\ndespite being significantly smaller than both CC (F0 and F1) and AA (F0) groups. Maternal cannibalism \n\n(i.e. during development, when new-born individuals are already capable to enter and exit the brood \n\npouch at will) could help explain this apparent disparity. Decreases in pH levels have already been linked \n\nto an increase in the number of cannibalistic crustacean species in acutely acidified lakes (Havens, \n\n1991), and cannibalism can also account for a significant portion of mortality rates in G. locusta (Christie \n\nand Kraufvelin, 2004, Costa et al., 2005) \n\n The results also suggest the existence of negative maternal effects regarding fecundity that were \n\npresent in both F1-AA and F1-AC groups. Mean fecundity for F1-AC was significantly reduced when \n\ncompared to this treatment\u2019s parent generation, and just as reduced as F1-AA, and followed the same \n\ntendency as female investment for the same treatment. Vehmaa (2016), also showed the existence of \n\nsignificant negative maternal effects of pH on egg hatching success in Acartia sp.  \n\n The (~) 10% reduction in the mean number of eggs in the control group from F0 to F1 was not \n\nfollowed by a significant reduction in the number of younglings that successfully hatched and reached \n\nthe age of brood-exit. This could be explained by normal female variability in this trait \u2013 since females \n\nthat were sampled for egg count were not the same that were sampled for fecundity, as discussed in the \n\nmaterials and methods section \u2013 and due to the high deviation ranges experienced for both these outputs \n\nin control.  \n\n \n\n  6.2.3 Embryonic development  \n\n \n\n The duration of embryonic development was unaffected by acidification. There is a lack of \n\nliterary information regarding this particular trait for amphipods, however, in Echinogammarus marinus \n\n(Leach, 1815), exposure to pH 7.5 resulted in delayed embryonic development at low salinities (22), but \n\nthis effect was absent at 35 (Egilsdottir et al., 2009). Also, similar reductions in pH had no effect on the \n\ngrowth rate of juveniles (from adolescence to sexual maturity) in the same species as ours (Hauton et \n\nal., 2009). It seems plausible that transgenerational exposure to ocean acidification by itself and in a \n\nreduced number of generations will not produce changes in the development rate of this marine \n\namphipod, as it was reported for other invertebrate species - e.g. Saccostrea glomerata (Parker et al., \n\n2012). It is possible that multigenerational exposure could, however, produce significant effects in the \n\nduration of embryonic development that have not been triggered by the current experiment duration.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n 6.3. Behavioural traits \n \n\n The behavioural trials showed, overall, that OA can significantly affect the ability of gammarid \n\nmales to successfully locate and track the origin of female waterborne cues. Males from F1-AA (who \n\nwere 2nd generation-exposed to high-CO2), spent significantly less time (in proportion regarding total \n\ntest time) in the association areas in which the female scent cue was present. On the other hand, males \n\nfrom the control condition spent the majority of trial time, on average, in the correct association area \n\nand hence, exhibiting the normal levels of attraction and cue tracking that would be characterized by \n\nnormal chemosensory reception.  \n\n The decreased proportion of time spent in the presence of female cues could indicate a decreased \n\nability to accurately track and locate the origin of a cue trail in the water column, as has already been \n\ndescribed for Eurytemora affinis and Temora longicornis (Seuront, 2010). Acidified males did exhibit \n\na mean proportion of 50% of the time spent in the correct association area, despite the increased \n\ndeviation range for both treatments. This supports the possibility that males could be unable to detect \n\nthe female pheromones, since this proportion is neither indicative of attraction nor avoidance. The fact \n\nthat there were no statistical differences between F1-AA and F1-CC regarding first-choice means that, \n\non average, acidified males can still detect and be positively stimulated by exposure to a female \n\npheromone trail. This would suggest that although males exposed to OA are not able to correctly identify \n\nand track the origin of this cue, they are still being positively stimulated by it to some extent. Also, the \n\nresponse time at trial start exhibited by males was also significantly higher under OA. This could suggest \n\nthat such males experienced, in the F1 generation at least, a reduction in stimuli response time linked to \n\nphysiological-induced locomotor impairments.  \n\n The possibility that using treatment-conditioned water for the behavioural tests would damage \n\nor degrade the female cues involved in the attraction of males was dismissed. Although the effect of pH \n\non signalling molecules in the context of OA has yet to be sufficiently explored on a molecular level \n\n(Roggatz et al., 2016), so far only in one freshwater system has molecular evidence for cue degradation \n\nbeen described, which directly affected individual response to alarm cues \u2013 the cue in question being a \n\nnaturally occurring purine derivative, hypoxanthine (Brown et al., 2002). Marine studies involving CO2-\n\ninduced acidification and the testing of behavioural responses to olfactory stimuli in fish, showed that, \n\nin overall, the observed changes were not caused by chemical modification of the odour cues, at least \n\nfor a change in pH levels of approximately 0.5 units (Leduc et al., 2013). Also, aquatic sex pheromones \n\nthat are known to be potentially affected by pH include peptides, nucleosides, thiols and organic acids \n\n(Hardege et al., 2011), while hormones that are most likely involved in acting as male attractants in long \n\ndistances for gammarid amphipods (like the active moulting hormone 20-OH-ecdysone) belong to the \n\nsteroid compound class (Thummel and Chory, 2002), that are not included in the mentioned hormone \n\ncategories. \n\n The present study showed, for the first time, sexually-related chemo-sensory disruption in \n\nmarine amphipods. In marine fish, OA was also responsible for the loss of avoidance behaviour in larvae \n\nof the anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus to chemical alarm cues, as well as a reversal to the elicited \n\nresponse with attraction to this cue (Welch et al., 2014). Yet, such study showed that transgenerational \n\nacclimation alone was not able to reverse these effects. Further testing on subsequent generations of G. \n\nlocusta is, therefore, important in order to address possible transgenerational effects on this particular \n\ntrait.  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n 6.4. Metabolism  \n \n\n Results from the mass-specific RMR analysis showed that mean routine O2 consumption rates \n\nwere significantly reduced in amphipods that had been exposed to high-CO2 for two generations (F1-\n\nAA). This effect can be the direct result of respiratory-stress induced by hypercapnia \u2013 abnormally high \n\nconcentrations of dissolved CO2 in the haemolymph (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004). The decrease in extracellular \n\npH unbalances the regulation of the intracellular acid-base status in the organism (by slowing down the \n\nrate of H+ equivalent ion exchange in Na+/H+- and Na+- dependent Cl-/HCO3\n- transporters), and when \n\nuncompensated, this decrease leads to acidosis-induced metabolic depression (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004). \n\nMetabolic depression is considered as a time-limited adaptation strategy to survive unfavourable \n\nconditions, such as hypercapnia (Guppy and Withers, 1999), since it reduces the energy requirements \n\nof acid-base regulation (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004). In many calcifying and non-calcifying marine invertebrates \n\ntolerant to CO2 oscillations, prolonged high-CO2 exposure has been known to cause drops in metabolic \n\nrates and even, sometimes a phenomenon similar to anaesthesia (Reipschl\u00e4ger and P\u00f6rtner, 1996, \n\nP\u00f6rtner et al., 2004, Michaelidis et al., 2005).  \n\n By comparing female and male RMR, no significant differences were found which could \n\nindicate metabolic depression in either sex for each treatment, despite slightly higher values in female \n\nconsumption rates. This is a solid indicator that both males and females are equally subjected to \n\nmetabolic depression as a possible compensation for extracellular acidosis and, thus, are equally \n\nmetabolically affected by pH reductions in the environment. These results help support some of the \n\npreviously stated hypothesis, in which disruption of normal metabolic processes by OA might be playing \n\na role in modulating other life-history traits or behaviours.  \n\n \n\n \n\n7. Conclusions \n \n\n Ocean acidification is a pervasive stressor that will undoubtedly pose risks for marine \n\nbiodiversity in the future. Some marine species will have the ability to adapt to future global change, \n\nthrough transgenerational plasticity and epigenetics, but this adaptive potential can be relatively finite, \n\ndue to the presence of evolutionary trade-offs and reduction of extant genetic diversity (Calosi et al., \n\n2016). Our results highlight the hypothesis that gammarid amphipods, which are commonly considered \n\nmore tolerant than other species to future climate change, are also prone to negative effects of high-CO2. \n\nA summary of the results of all reproductive, behavioural and metabolic analysis is featured in Table \n\n7.1. \n\n First-exposure individuals showed an increase in female reproductive investment, a reduction \n\nin MG duration and decreased survival, despite exhibiting normal fecundity levels. The adoption of a \n\ndifferent reproductive strategy by females, could pose an active response regarding prolonged \n\nphysiological stress, which could aim to maximize genetic variability and thus, the chances that new, \n\nmore adapted phenotypes, could arise. Short-term survival (at 30 days) was also affected, leading to \n\nsurvival ratios approximately 19% lower than in control.  \n\n In marine invertebrates, the maintenance of acid-base balance is an energetically costly process \n\nthat does not occur spontaneously (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2004). Previous exposure to reduced pH during growth \n\n(from juvenile to maturity) for G. locusta has shown an increased and sustained expression of the gapdh \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1. Summary table of the results for the reproductive traits, behaviour and metabolism analysis. Arrows signify increase \n\n(?) or decrease (?) for a determined measurement, for the acidified treatments of first exposure (F0-A; F1-CA) and second \n\ngeneration (F1-AA).  \n\ngene (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which suggests that subtle changes in the \n\norganism\u2019s physiology do take place on OA scenarios (Hauton et al., 2009). This supports the possibility \n\nthat OA, as the organism\u2019s physiology attempts to compensate acid-base balance, is causing some \n\nimportant and negative effects on the metabolism of G. locusta, evidenced by changes in mean survival \n\nand in reproductive traits. In fact, in the second generation, both male and female amphipods suffered \n\nsome degree of metabolic depression, that is thought to constitute a survival enhancing strategy under \n\nstressful conditions, as it allows an active defence against disturbances in metabolism and tissue \n\nfunctioning induced by hypercapnia (Lannig et al., 2010). This result helps to explain the significant \n\nincrease in response time observed in the behavioural trials for high-CO2 exposed males, since metabolic \n\ndepression can be behaviourally expressed as a reduction in activity (anaesthesia). Not only did males \n\ntake more time to react to the female cues, but their preference responses were less clear than males in \n\nthe control group, suggesting that OA is potentially acting as a chemosensory disruptor. Decreased \n\nmetabolic rates could also explain the reduction in MG duration in the first generation, although no \n\nmetabolic data was collected for the parental generation.  Smaller amounts of energy could be available \n\nfor processes other than maintaining metabolism and acid-base balance, which could lead to males \n\ninvesting less in the active guarding of females, and potentially reducing the number of successful sexual \n\noccurrences between mates. Females in F1 also experienced a drop in investment by number of eggs, \n\nwhich culminated in reduced progeny.  \n\n The presence of parental effects was also identified. In female investment, MG, survival and \n\neven in fecundity, individuals reared in control conditions whose parents came from the acidified \n\nparental group always exhibited negative tendencies of traits, that either followed the negative trend of \n\ntheir parental generation (MG duration and survival) or the trend exhibited by the acidified population \n\nof the second generation (female investment and fecundity). Although two particular results seemed to \n\nhint to a possible transgenerational acclimation in F1-AA (MG and survival, specifically), these are most \n\nlikely due to the high deviance range of the data for these outputs in this particular treatment. It could \n\nbe, still, that prolonged transgenerational exposure is indeed acting towards acclimation of the \n\npopulation - with the potential genetic variability induced by high female investment in F0-AA \u2013 and \n\nthat the high deviation of the data is indeed a sign of this variability.  \n\n  \n\n \n\nTrait \nAcidified population's response regarding control \n\n1st exposure (F0-A; F1-CA) F1 (AA) Parental effects (F0 -> F1) \n\nSurvival at 30 days (%) ? no differences negative effects \n\nReproduction    \n\nDuration of mate-guarding (days) ? no differences negative effects \n\nNumber of eggs per female ? ? negative effects \n\nDuration of embryonic development \n\n(days) \nno differences no differences absent \n\nNumber of juveniles per female no differences ? negative effects \n\nBehaviour    \n\nResponse time (sec) - ? - \n\nFirst-choice - no differences - \n\nCumulative time (%) - ? - \n\nMetabolism    \n\nRoutine metabolic rate (RMR) - ? - \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n Further experimental tests are necessary to improve scientific knowledge towards understanding \n\nthe impacts of OA in amphipod\u2019s biological traits. Not only increasing the number of experimental \n\ngenerations, but also complementing these outputs with other useful data that could help shed some light \n\non the exact mechanisms that might be at play. First, regarding reproductive trials, it would be important \n\nto complement female investment (in number) with data on egg quality, size and shape, and following \n\nembryonic development to address the existence of abnormalities of development in younglings. Mate-\n\nguarding duration should be complemented by a quantitative analysis of successful mate encounters \u2013 \n\nwhich should be reduced, since high-CO2 negatively affected the ability of males to identify the origin \n\nor the presence of female cues in the water current. Since males rely on both long and short distance \n\nchemical cues to track females and initiate MG behaviour, specific tests should be designed to assess \n\npossible disruption in the detection of contact-pheromones, and in possible modification of the success \n\nof MG initiation. It is also important to test for chemosensory disruption of other fitness-enhancing \n\nchemically-based behaviours: i) does OA only affect the detection of sexual cues, or does it disrupt all \n\nof the amphipod\u2019s chemoreception mechanisms and equally decreases individual\u2019s response to other \n\nconspecific and heterospecific, or even environmental cues? ii) does OA impair the conspecific \n\nrecognition mechanisms that elicit gregarious behaviours in this species, and, does it decrease the ability \n\nto detect predator and injured conspecific cues in water-currents - thus increasing mortality by intra- and \n\ninterspecific predation?  \n\n It is also important to assess whether metabolic depression carries on in subsequent generations, \n\nand if individual survival is indeed maximized, and amphipods eventually begin to show a positive \n\ncomeback from the apparent negative effect of OA, thus hinting at transgenerational acclimation.  \n\n Trans- and multigenerational approaches to OA and other stressors, as well as possible \n\nsynergies, in climate-change ecology are fundamental in order to help managers and policy-makers in \n\nthe development of measures towards the protection of global environments. It is only through long-\n\nterm experimental evolutionary studies that scientists will be able to accurately understand the expected \n\neffects of these stressors on different levels of biological organization (i.e. from molecules and cells, to \n\ncommunities and ecosystems).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n8.
