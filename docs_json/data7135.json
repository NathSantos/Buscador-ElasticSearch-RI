More\nattention has been paid to practices aiming at the recovery of degraded soils in the\nlast years, e.g, the use of organic fertilizers, liming and introduction of species\nadapted to adverse conditions.  The purpose of this study was therefore to\ninvestigate the recovery of physical properties of a Red Latosol (Oxisol) degraded\nby the construction of a hydroelectric power station.  In the study area, a soil layer\nabout 8m thick had been withdrawn by heavy machines leading not only to soil\ncompaction, but resulting in high-degree degradation.  The experiment was\narranged in a completely randomized design with nine treatments and four\nreplications.  The treatments consisted of: 1- soil mobilization by tilling (to ensure\nthe effect of mechanical mobilization in all treatments) without planting, but growth\nof spontaneous vegetation; 2- Black velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum Piper &amp;\nTracy); 3- Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) DC); 4- Liming + black velvet bean; 5-\nLiming + pigeonpea until 1994, when replaced by jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis);\n6- Liming + gypsum + black velvet bean; 7- Liming + gypsum + pigeonpea until 1994,\nwhen replaced by jack bean; and two controls as reference: 8- Native Cerrado\nvegetation and 9- bare soil (no tilling and no planting), left under natural conditions\nand in this situation, without spontaneous vegetation.  In treatments 1 through 7,\nthe soil was tilled.  Treatments were installed in 1992 and left unmanaged for\nseven years, until brachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens) was planted in all plots in\n1999.  Seventeen years after implantation, the properties soil macroporosity,\nmicroporosity, total porosity, bulk density and aggregate stability were assessed\nin the previously described treatments in the soil layers 0.00\u20130.10; 0.10\u20130.20 and\n0.20\u20130.40 m, and soil Penetration Resistance and soil moisture in 0.00\u20130.15 and\n0.15\u20130.30 m.  The plants were evaluated for: brachiaria dry matter and spontaneous\ngrowth of native tree species in the plots as of 2006.  Results were analyzed by\n\n(1) Part of the Master\u00b4s Dissertation of the first author.

In all treatments,\nexcept for the bare soil (no recovery measures), ongoing recovery of the degraded\nsoil physical properties was observed.  Macroporosity, soil bulk density and total\nporosity were good soil quality indicators.  The occurrence of spontaneous native\nspecies indicated the soil recovery process.  The best adapted species was\nMachaerium acutifolium Vogel, with the largest number of plants and most\nadvanced development; the dry matter production of B.  decumbens in recovering\nsoil was similar to normal conditions, evidencing soil recovery.\n\nIndex terms: soil bulk density, total porosity, soil degradation, soil quality.\n\nRESUMO:        RECUPERA\u00c7\u00c3O DAS PROPRIEDADES F\u00cdSICAS DO SOLO POR\nMEIO DE ADUBOS VERDES, CALAGEM, GESSO, PASTAGEM E\nESP\u00c9CIES DE OCORR\u00caNCIA ESPONT\u00c2NEA\n\nO uso inadequado pode degradar os recursos naturais, sobretudo o solo.

Nesse sentido, desenvolveu-se o presente trabalho com o objetivo de investigar a\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades f\u00edsicas de um Latossolo Vermelho degradado devido \u00e0 constru\u00e7\u00e3o\nde usina hidrel\u00e9trica.  Na \u00e1rea estudada, foi retirada uma camada de solo de aproximadamente\n8 m de espessura, com o uso de m\u00e1quinas pesadas, o que causou compacta\u00e7\u00e3o do solo,\ncaracterizando alto grau de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o.  O delineamento experimental utilizado foi\ninteiramente casualizado, com nove tratamentos e quatro repeti\u00e7\u00f5es.  Os tratamentos foram:\n1-solo mobilizado pelo preparo (para se obter o efeito mec\u00e2nico da mobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o em todos os\ntratamentos) e sem plantio, deixando a ocorr\u00eancia de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea; 2-mucuna-preta\n(Stizolobium aterrimum Piper &amp; Tracy); 3-guandu (Cajanus cajan (L.)

Nos tratamentos 1 a 7 o solo foi\nmobilizado pelo preparo.  Os tratamentos foram instalados em 1992 e permaneceram por sete\nanos, at\u00e9 que em 1999 implantou-se Brachiaria decumbens em todas as parcelas\nexperimentais.  Ap\u00f3s 17 anos de implantados os tratamentos descritos, foram avaliadas as\npropriedades: macroporosidade, microporosidade, porosidade total, densidade do solo e\nestabilidade de agregados nas camadas de 0,00\u20130,10, 0,10\u20130,20 e 0,20\u20130,40 m, resist\u00eancia do\nsolo \u00e0 penetra\u00e7\u00e3o e umidade do solo (0,00\u20130,15 e 0,15\u20130,30 m).  Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s plantas,\nforam avaliados a massa seca da braqui\u00e1ria e o crescimento das esp\u00e9cies arb\u00f3reas nativas que\nsurgiram espontaneamente nas parcelas experimentais, sendo notadas a partir de 2006.  Os\nresultados foram analisados efetuando-se a an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e2ncia e o teste de Tukey a 5 % para\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9dias.  Todos os tratamentos adotados, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o do solo exposto (sem\ninterven\u00e7\u00e3o para a sua recupera\u00e7\u00e3o), est\u00e3o recuperando as propriedades f\u00edsicas do solo\ndegradado.  A macroporosidade, densidade do solo e porosidade total foram bons indicadores\nda qualidade do solo.  A ocorr\u00eancia de esp\u00e9cies nativas espont\u00e2neas foi um indicativo do\nprocesso de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, e a esp\u00e9cie Machaerium acutifolium Vogel foi a mais adaptada,\npelo maior n\u00famero de plantas e maior desenvolvimento; a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de massa seca de Brachiaria\ndecumbens no solo em recupera\u00e7\u00e3o foi semelhante \u00e0 do solo sob condi\u00e7\u00e3o natural, atestando a\nsua recupera\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nTermos de indexa\u00e7\u00e3o: densidade do solo, porosidade do solo, degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, qualidade do\nsolo.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDue to population growth and, consequently,\neconomical development, environmental resources\nhave been widely affected in the last decades.\n\nCurrently, of the natural resources degraded by\nanthropic actions, the natural characteristics of soil\nhave been the most affected, mainly by inadequate\nexploration.  The history of soil use shows that these\nalterations are not always followed by a new\n\n\n\nRECOVERY OF SOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES BY GREEN MANURE, LIMING, GYPSUM...               1399\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1397-1406, 2011\n\nsustainable ecological system and that soils under\nintensive and improper use will be degraded (Alves &amp;\nSouza, 2008).\n\nFor the maintenance and improvement of the soil\nphysical conditions, the addition and positive balance\nof organic matter is fundamental, based on the supply\nof organic matter, root action, macro- and\nmicrobiological activities and decomposition of organic\nmatter (Alves, 1992).\n\nIn the recovery of a degraded soil the great\nchallenge is the formation of a new horizon A,\nunderlying the reestablishment of the surface layer\nand of other horizons (Noffs, 2000).\n\nVezzani &amp; Mielniczuk (2009) report that Brazilian\nresearchers are seeking for more adequate soil quality\nindicators, proposing indicators related to physical\n(Alves et al., 2007), chemical (Ribeiro et al., 2007),\nand biological (Vargas &amp; Scholles, 2000) properties or\na range of intergrated indicators (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2007).\nThese indicators are chosen according to the ease of\nuse, and infrastructure and economic conditions.  It\nis important to remember that a set of indicators is\nthe most adequate option for a safe diagnosis.\n\nThe biological diversity and the intensity and\nduration of disturbances determine the resilience of\necosystems.  Ecosystem restoration is the term\nattributed to the challenge to, by means of planned\nactions, recover soil structure \u2013 one of the fundamental\nconditions for restoration success \u2013 and consequently,\nimprove aeration, mass/volume ratio, and soil water\nretention.  This will create, the physical conditions\nfor the re-establishment, also, of natural ecological\nprocesses, i.e., seed germination, seedling emergence\nand development, and return of vegetable residues to\nthe soil, an energy source for soil organisms (Alves et\nal., 2007).  In this context, Reis &amp; Kageyama (2003)\nadd that crop succession is a complex and concomitant\nprocess, which improves soil conditions, the\nmicroclimate, as well as the diversity of flora, fauna\nand also decomposers.\n\nResilience represents the capacity of an ecosystem\nfor regeneration after some natural or anthropogenic\ndegradation (Aronson et al., 1994).  The resilience of\ndegraded areas is very low or nearly inexistent, due\nto the elimination of the means of natural\nregeneration, i.e., the soil seed bank and surface layer\n(Kageyama et al., 1992).  In this case, restoration is a\nslow and difficult process, requiring a careful choice\nof plants with high growth capacity and good\ndevelopment in these degraded environments, as well\nas the use of soil management practices which support\ntheir recovery (Alves et al., 2007).\n\nA number of techniques are used for restoration of\ndegraded soils; most of them combine mechanical\npractices, to break up compact layers, with the input\nof organic matter.  Alves et al. (2007); Kitamura et\nal. (2008) and Campos &amp; Alves (2008) reported\nimproved soil quality by means of addition of organic\n\nmatter (using green manure, sewage sludge) and\nconfirmed the beneficial effects on the soil physical\nproprieties (bulk density, total porosity and\nmacroporosity), in other words, a decrease in soil bulk\ndensity and increase in total porosity and\nmacroporosity, as well as a better development of\nplants.\n\nThe problem of degradation in the study area was\na consequence of the construction of the Hydroelectric\nPower Station Ilha Solteira, in S\u00e3o Paulo.  Although\npower generation by water is considered one of the\nleast harmful solutions, the dam constructions tend\nto cause strong degradation in many surrounding\nareas evidenced by, e.g., the withdrawal of vegetation\nand soil layers, as well as flooding.  Therefore, among\nthe areas affected by the dam constructions, there\nare \u201cloan areas\u201d (from which soil is removed for the\nfoundations of the dam wall), as well as unstable slopes\nand wetlands, flooded areas, etc. (Alves &amp; Souza, 2008).\n\nDue to the impact generated by the large civil\nconstructions, it is necessary to develop techniques\nand alternatives for the recovery of these\nenvironments, where soil layers and the natural seed\nbank had been removed.  Alves et al. (2007) studied\nthe soil recovery of an area degraded by a civil\nconstruction, (hydroelectric plant), and concluded that\nsoil quality improvement is possible by tilling,\napplication of sewage sludge and green manuring, as\nindicated by the increased porosity, lower bulk\ndensity, improved water infiltration.  Kitamura et al.\n(2008) reported the recovery of soil physical properties\n(bulk density, macroporosity, total porosity, aggregate\nstability) in another loan area degraded by soil removal\nfor dam construction and that soil bulk density was\nthe best physical indicator of the soil alterations.\n\nIn the search for solutions to the problems\ninvolving soil restoration, efforts are being made to\nidentify the most adaptable species to the adverse\nconditions, as well as their positive effects on the soil\nproprieties, the recovery speed, and also to understand\nthe factors associated to the resilience of the area under\nstudy, such as climate, water storage in the soil, and\nthe capability of development of planted or spontaneous\nspecies.  In this sense, some physical properties of a\nRed Latosol, under restoration for 17 years using green\nmanure, liming, gypsum and pasture were evaluated,\ntogether with Brachiaria decumbens dry matter and\nspontaneous occurrence of native tree species.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe study was conducted in a degraded area in\nSelv\u00edria, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, (latitude 20 o 22 \u2019\nSouth, longitude 51 o 22 \u2019 West, altitude 327 m asl).  The\nmean annual rainfall in the region is 1,370 mm,\ntemperature 23.5 oC and relative humidity between 70\nand 80 %.  The soil in the study area, by the Brazilian\nSoil Classification System is a dystrophic Red Latosol\n\n\n\n1400 Carolina dos Santos Batista Bonini &amp; Marlene Cristina Alves\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1397-1406, 2011\n\n(Dematt\u00ea, 1980; Embrapa, 2006), corresponding to an\nOxisol by the US Soil Taxonomy.\n\nFrom the area under study, a layer of 8.6 m had\nbeen withdrawn from the original soil surface for the\nconstruction of Hydroelectric Power Station Ilha\nSolteira, leaving the bare subsoil of the area exposed\nas of 1969 (Alves &amp; Souza, 2008).  In 1992, the subsoil\nwas surface-compacted and a little spontaneous\nvegetation had grown.  In that year, restoration work\nwas initiated.  First, tilling was performed by\nsubsoiling to an average depth of 0.41 m.  The soil\nwas also plowed and harrowed with leveling disks and\nthe soil analyzed physically and chemically: soil bulk\ndensity = 1.76 kg dm-3; P = 0.5 mg dm-3; MO =\n5.5 g dm-3; pH (CaCl2) = 4.1; K = 0.2 mmolc dm-3; Ca2+\n= 0.2 mmolc dm-3; Mg2+ = 1.0 mmolc dm-3; sum of\nbases = 3.2 mmolc dm-3; H + Al = 20.0 mmolc dm-3;\nCEC = 23.2 mmolc dm-3 and V = 14 %.\n\nSoil particle-size analysis determined 235 g kg-1\nclay, 30 g kg-1 silt and 750 g kg-1 sand, in the soil under\nnatural vegetation.  In the loan area, after withdrawal\nof a 8.6 m thick surface layer, 261 g kg-1 clay,\n152 g kg-1 silt and 662 g kg-1 sand was found.  Under\nboth conditions, the textural soil class is sandy clay\nloam.\n\nLiming was based on the chemical characterization\nof the experimental area.  Lime was applied to raise\nbase saturation to 70 %, and in the treatments which\nincluded lime and gypsum, 25 % of lime CaO weas\nreplaced by 25 % of gypsum CaO, which were both\nincorporated into the soil.\n\nThe green manure species (Stizolobium\naterrimum, Cajanus cajan and Canavalia ensiformis)\nwere sown by hand in December and January, from\n1992 to 1996, at a density of 10 seeds m-2 and row\nspacing of 0.50 m.  The green manure management\nconsisted of mowing the plants and leaving them on\nthe surface.\n\nIn 1996, four years after treatment installation,\nthe soil was limed again, based on chemical analysis,\nonly in the treatments with lime and lime + gypsum.\n\nThe substitution of lime by gypsum followed the same\nprocedure as described above.  Liming was applied to\nraise base saturation to 70 % in the cases where it\nwas &lt;60 %.\n\nIn January 1997, corn (Zea mays L.), an AG 405\nhybrid, was sown in all experimental plots.\nFertilization consisted of 250 kg ha-1 4-30-10 NPK plus\n0.3 % Zn, without liming.  In June 1998, black oat\n(Avena strigosa Schieb) was also sown in all\nexperimental plots.  In February 1999, the forage grass\n(Brachiaria decumbens Stapf.) was sown as soil\nprotection and to provide organic matter.  In 2006,\nthe presence of native Cerrado tree species was assessed.\n\nThe experiment had a completely randomized\ndesign, consisting of nine treatments and four\nreplications.  A border of 2 m on all sides of each\n10 x 10 m plot was disregarded (assessed area 64 m2)\nand replications were 2 m apart from each other.\n\nThe treatments consisted of: (1) OT/B: soil tilling\nwithout planting, allowing growth of spontaneous\nvegetation, until 1999, followed by planting of\nbrachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens); (2) SA/B: black\nvelvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum Piper &amp; Tracy)\nuntil 1999 and then replacement with brachiaria; (3)\nCC/CE/B: Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) DC) until\n1994, then replacement with jack bean (Canavalia\nensiformis), and as of 1999, replacement with\nbrachiaria; (4) L+SA/B: Liming + black velvet bean\nuntil 1999, when replaced with brachiaria; (5) L+CC/\nCE/B: Liming plus pigeonpea until 1994, when\nreplaced with jack bean, and as of 1999, replaced by\nbrachiaria; (6) L+GY+SA/B: Liming + gypsum + black\nvelvet bean until 1999, then replaced by brachiaria;\n(7) L+GY+CC/CE/B: Liming +gypsum+pigeonpea\nuntil 1994, when replaced by jack bean, and as of\n1999, replaced by brachiaria, and two controls as\nreference; (8) NV: Native Cerrado vegetation and (9)\nBS: Bare soil (no tilling and no planting) (Table 1).\n\nThe controls bare soil and native Cerrado were\nincluded for comparison among treatments, so as to\nmonitor the recovery of the studied physical\n\nTable 1.

An approach of the physical properties of\nthe exposed soil to those of soil under natural vegetation\nwould mean the restoration of the degraded soil\n(anthropogenic intervention would be accelerating the\nrecovery process).  Differences observed in the recovery\ntreatments compared to the control bare soil would\nindicate beneficial changes in the soil properties.\nThese changes would be interpreted in comparison\nwith the soil conditions under natural vegetation.\n\nIn January 2008, the following soil physical\nproperties were assessed: soil bulk density, by the\nvolumetric ring method; total porosity, by measuring\nsoil saturation (total volume of water-filled soil pores);\nmicroporosity was assessed using the tension table\nand a water column of 6 kPa; and macroporosity was\ncalculated from the difference between total porosity\nand microporosity.  All evaluations were performed\naccording to methodologies described by Embrapa\n(1997).  The distribution and aggregate stability in water\nin this study is represented by the mean weighted\ndiameter (MWD), according to Angers &amp; Mehuys\nmethodology (2000).  Soil Penetration Resistance was\ndetermined by a Penetrographer PAT SC-60 and soil\nmoisture on a mass basis (Embrapa, 1997).\n\nFor the analysis, according to their specific\ncharacteristics, disturbed and non-disturbed soil\nsamples were collected from three layers: 0.00\u20130.10;\n0.10\u20130.20, and 0.20\u20130.40 m.  Soil Penetration\nResistance as well as soil gravimetric moisture were\nassessed in the layers 0.00\u20130.15 and 0.15\u20130.30.\n\nDry matter mass was evaluated every three\nmonths.  Plants from two points (contained in 1 m2)\nper plot were collected and weighed (drying at 60\u2013\n70 oC to constant weight) and expressed in kg ha-1.\nThe stem diameter and height of tree species of\nspontaneous occurrence in the experimental area were\nassessed.\n\nResults of soil physical evaluations were analyzed\nby variance analysis and Tukey test at 5 % for mean\ncomparison.  Sisvar software (Ferreira, 2003) was used\nfor the statistical analysis.  It is emphasized that, for\nstem diameter and height of the spontaneous tree\nspecies, no statistical analysis was performed due to the\nvariations in numbers of plants per plot (statistically\nnot controlled because occurrence was spontaneous).\nTherefore, the plants were only characterized.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTable 2 shows the significant difference among\ntreatments in soil macroporosity, microporosity and\nbulk density as well as the MWD in all layers.  For\ntotal porosity, significant differences were observed\nin all layers but 0.10\u20130.20.\n\nFor macroporosity in the bare soil (degraded, no\nrecovery measures) values were observed below the\nlimit considered critical for a good development of the\nplant root system, i.e., 0.10 m3 m-3 (Baver, 1949;\nGreenland, 1981; Gupta &amp; Allmaras, 1987), in the\n\nTable 2. Average figures for macroposity, microporosity, total porosity, soil bulk density and mean weighted\ndiameter (mm) in the layers 0.00\u20130.10, 0.10\u20130.20 and 0.20\u20130.40 m, in the treatments studied, in 2008\n\nAverages followed by equal letters in rows did not differ from each other by Tukey test at 5 %. OT/B: soil tilled until 1999,\nfollowed by implantation of brachiaria; SA/B: Stizolobium aterrimum until 1999, and then brachiaria; CC/CE/B: Cajanus cajan\nuntil 1994, replaced then by Canavalia ensiformis, and as of 1999, replaced by brachiaria; L+SA/B: Liming +Stizolobium\ninterrimum until 1999, replaced then by  brachiaria; L+GY+SA/B: Liming + Gypsum + Stizolobium aterrimum until 1999, then\nreplaced by brachiaria; L+GY+CC/CE/B: Liming + Gypsum + Cajanus cajan until 1994, then replaced by Canavalia ensiformis,\nand, as of 1999, replaced by brachiaria; NV: Native Cerrado vegetation; BS: bare soil.\n\n\n\n1402 Carolina dos Santos Batista Bonini &amp; Marlene Cristina Alves\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1397-1406, 2011\n\nthree soil layers studied.  It is noteworthy that in\nlayer 0.00\u20130.10 m, three treatments approached the\ncritical limit (SA/B; CC/CE/B; L+GY/SA/B), while five\nexceeded it (OT/B; L+SA/B; L+GY/CE/B; NV),\nalthough there were no statistical differences among\nthem.  In terms of soil quality, this means that the\nphysical conditions in treatments in which\nmacroporosity exceeded the limit are better for a good\ndevelopment of the root system.  Under natural\nCerrado vegetation, macroporosity was higher in the\nthree soil layers and statistically different from the\nother treatments.\n\nThe reduction in macroporosity in degraded soils\nresults from increased compaction, as evidenced in\nthe higher bulk density (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2004; Camilotti\net al., 2005).  A similar behavior was observed by\nCampos &amp; Alves (2006) and Kitamura et al. (2008),\nin agreement with the observations in this study\n(Table 2).\n\nIn the layers 0.10\u20130.20 and 0.20\u20130.40, macroporosity\nwas similar in the soils under treatment and the bare\nsoil (degraded), indicating that the treatments had no\neffect below 0.10 m.  Effects in deeper layers take longer\nbecause the response to recovery of physical properties\nof Cerrado soils is slow (Alves &amp; Suzuki, 2004).\n\nThe physical properties of soils used as quality\nindicators show that the surface layer is being\nrecovered (Table 2): macroporosity was higher and/or\nsimilar to the critical value; for soil with average\ntexture, the values of bulk density were within the\naverage bulk density range for this textural class\n(1.40\u20131.50 kg dm-3).  It is noted that the texture of\nthe exposed soil (under study in this work) is sandy-\nclay loam soil (258, 79 and 663 g kg-1 of clay, silt and\nsand, respectively) (Campos &amp; Alves, 2006; Kitamura\net al., 2008).\n\nA comparison of means of physical properties taken\nas indicators of soil quality among the recovery\ntreatments (Table 2) showed a similar behavior in the\nstudied soil layers.  These findings corroborate results\nof Alves et al. (2007) in an area degraded by a power\nplant construction.\n\nThe data of total soil porosity and bulk density in\nthe layer 0.00\u20130.10 m (Table 2) confirm the soil\nrecovery in this layer.  Total porosity was similar\namong the treatments used for soil restoration, but\nwas greater than and statistically different from the\nbare soil (degraded).  On the other hand, except for\nthe treatment with L+GY+SA/B, results were similar\nin soil with natural Cerrado vegetation, indicating\nimprovements in the soil structure.  For soil bulk\ndensity, though, values were similar among the\nrecovery treatments, lower than in the bare soil, and\nhigher than under natural Cerrado vegetation.\n\nIn general there are similarities among the soil\nrecovery treatments influencing the layer 0.00\u2013\n0.10 m, corroborating results of Campos &amp; Alves\n(2006); Alves et al. (2007) and Kitamura et al. (2008).\n\nIt is worth highlighting the action of treatment lime+\nblack velvet bean/brachiaria, in 0.00\u20130.10 m, with\nsimilar results to the soil under natural Cerrado\nvegetation.  This means that the treatment is efficient\nin soil recovery, since the conditions are similar to\nthose of a soil with natural vegetation.  These results\nconfirm findings of Alves (2001) and Alves et al. (2007).\n\nIn the surface layers (0.10\u20130.20 and 0.20\u20130.40 m)\ndata obtained in this study (Table 2) compared with\ndata obtained in the same area by Andrade J\u00fanior\n(2004) and Alves &amp; Souza (2008) show improvements\nin the soil physical quality, i.e, a restructuration of\nthe soil occurred, reflected in the decrease of bulk\ndensity and increase of macroporosity and total\nporosity.  Despite these improvements, it was noted\nthat the physical properties were still degraded\n(smaller macroporosity, greater bulk density, less total\nporosity, compared to the critical limits and natural\nsoil conditions).  Reichert et al. (2003) stated that the\nevaluation of soil quality has both spatial and temporal\ndimensions.  Intervals between measurements, to\nobserve changes in the indicator assessed, depend on\nthe period required for an action to produce quantifiable\nchanges, and its frequency in space must take the\nspatial variations caused by the soil into account.\nAndrade J\u00fanior (2004) mentions that, as time passes,\nbrachiaria roots supply organic matter to the soil while\nthe addition of organic matter by green manures and\nthe brachiaria root system have a positive effect on\nthe physical soil properties.\n\nFor soil penetration resistance in the layer 0.00\u2013\n0.10 m, values were highest (4.9 MPa) for the bare\nsoil (Table 3).  There was no difference between the\nsoil with natural Cerrado vegetation and the recovery\ntreatments, and values varied from 2.2 to 3.7 MPa.\nMany are the studies focused on the search for a\ncritical value or a range of critical values of soil\npenetration resistance limiting plant growth, but\nuncertainties still remain about these limits, due to\nthe diversity of behaviors of plants and soils (Reichert\net al., 2007).  It is known that the soil penetration\nresistance increases with soil degradation and\ncompaction; limiting values to root growth vary from\n1.5 to 3.0 MPa (Grant &amp; Lanfond, 1993), from 2.0 to\n4.0 MPa (Arshad et al., 1996), and in nop-tillage\nsystems they reach 5.0 MPa (Ehlers et al., 1983).  The\nrecovery treatments show that the soil is being\nrestored, since the soil penetration resistance showed\nthat the soil was less compacted in the treatment areas\nthan in the bare soil.\n\nThe determination of soil moisture at the moment\nof evaluation of soil penetration resistance is\nfundamental for a proper interpretation of the results.\nThe moisture degree influences the evaluation by\nmodifying cohesion among soil particles, which is\ngreater in dry soils and decreases as the water content\nincreases, causing particle detachment (Klein et al.,\n1998).  Soil moisture was similar among treatments\n(Table 3).  It is worth emphasizing the value of soil\n\n\n\nRECOVERY OF SOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES BY GREEN MANURE, LIMING, GYPSUM...               1403\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1397-1406, 2011\n\nresistance under natural Cerrado vegetation\n(3.0 MPa), which was deemed high This was probably\ndue to the low water content in the soil, since Campos\n(2006), for the soil in study (Red Latosol sandy-clay\nloam texture under natural Cerrado vegetation)\nobserved that at this moisture level, the tension value\nin soil water was 200 kPa.  Nevertheless, what is\nrelevant is that the water content was similar among\nthe treatments.\n\nIn the layer 0.15\u20130.30 m (Table 3), soil penetration\nresistance under Cerrado vegetation and in the\nrecovery treatments with SA/B, L+GY+SA/B and\nL+GY+G/CE/B was lower than in the bare (degraded)\nsoil.  But among the soil recovery treatments no\ndifference was noted.  This behavior is consistent with\nobservations for soil porosity and bulk density, i..e,\nthe treatments were more efficient in the soil surface\nlayer.\n\nFor brachiaria dry matter production (Table 4),\nsignificance was noted for treatment and time, while\nthe interaction of treatment x time was not significant.\nWhen comparing all soil recovery treatments, the\ntreatments L+GY+CC/CE/B and L+GY+SA/B\nproduced the most and the least amount of brachiaria\ndry matter, respectively.  But among the other\ntreatments there was no difference.  It was expected\nthat the treatment with lime and gypsum would be\nthe most efficient in brachiaria dry matter production,\nwhich was not confirmed.  Among the green manures,\nthe performance of black velvet bean was better than\nof jack bean in terms of residual effects, reflected in\nthe growth of brachiaria.  In contrast, Andrade J\u00fanior\n(2004), working in the same area, reported greater\nbrachiaria dry matter production by the treatment\nL+GY+CC/CE, in disagreement with the results\npresented here.  Brachiaria dry matter was equal to\nor higher than observed by Kawatoko (1999), who\nreported results between 1,818 to 2439 kg ha-1 in Red\n\nLatosol.  This shows that this soil is in recovery\nprocess, since the values here found are equivalent to\nthose in soil under natural conditions.\n\nThe occurrence of spontaneous tree species in the\narea was assessed in October 2007 and showed the\npresence of three species: Machaerium acutifolium\nVogel, Solanum lycocarpum St.  Hil and Mimosa\nlacticifera Rizini and Mattos Filho (Table 5).

Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1397-1406, 2011\n\nof 88 plants were identified of which 85 were M.\nacutifolium species, two S.  lycocarpum, and one M.\nlacticifera.  In 2009, the S.  lycocarpum plants were\nno longer observed in the area, while three more M.\nacutifoliumt plants had grown, and one new plant of\nthe species Curatella Americana L, of the family\nDilleniaceae had appeared.  The dynamics of the\noccurrence of these species in the study area was most\nlikely related to their adaptation to the adverse soil\nconditions (degraded structure).\n\nIt can be noted that, of the three species which\nregrew naturally in the study area, one belonged to the\nfamily Fabaceae (M. lactifera).  The Fabaceae are\nconsidered essential for the success of regeneration of a\ndegraded area in view of their rusticity and high ability\nto provide the soil with organic matter (Costa, 2007).\n\nWhen analyzing the development of the species\nMachaerium acutifolium Vogel, the species with the\nlargest number, it was observed that this was the\nspecies with the greatest growth (height and diameter)\nin treatment L+GY+CC/CE/B, followed by treatments\nSA/B, CC/CE/B and L+GY+SA/B (Table 5).  Ferreira\net al. (2007), when evaluating the development of tree\nspecies in an area degraded by the construction of a\npower plant, found that, of all species analyzed\n(Piptadenia gonoacantha, Inga affinis, Clitoria\nfairchildiana, Machaerium villosum, Anadenanthera\ncolubrine, Acacia mangium, Cecropia pachystachya,\nTrema micrantha, Erythrina falcate and Acacia\nauriculiformis) the tallest species with the largest\naverage diameters belonged to the family Fabaceae,\nreinforcing the thesis that the species of this family\nare fundamental for the recovery of degraded areas,\nbecause they grow fast in adverse environments.  It\nis important to enhance their occurrence from the\nAmazon region across to S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso\n\ndo Sul.  The spontaneous incidence of this species in\nthe recovering area, with the greatest number and\ndevelopment, show evidence of the efficiency of the\ntreatments for soil recovery.\n\nSome authors associate the competition of\nbrachiaria with the development of other species.  For\nDurigan et al. (1998), grasses (Poaceae) compete with\nthe Cerrado species, slowing down, or even preventing\nthe process of natural regeneration.  Reis &amp; Kageyama\n(2003) however highlight that grasses in general\nproduce substances capable of preventing the growth\nof other species by means of a process called antibiosis.\nOn the other hand, this does not mean that they\nshould be avoided in restoration processes in view of\ntheir capacity of colonization, of organic matter\nproduction and improvement in soil quality.  Results\nof this study confirm information of Seitz (1994), who\nstated that anemochoric species tend to be the first to\ntake root after total vegetation destruction.\n\nAs an anemochoric species, these plants may have\nbeen brought to the experimental area by wind\ndispersal of seeds from an adult plant.  This is evidence\nof the importance of dispersal in the recovery processes\nof degraded areas.  It can therefore be said that, for\nthe species Machaerium acutifolium, the variable\nnumber of plants was influenced by the proximity of\nthe matrix plant in relation to the experimental plots,\nonce the highest number of plants of this species was\nfound in the plots closest to the adult plant.  Stem\ndiameter and height of the plants were influenced by\nthe treatments since the greatest average diameters\nwere found in the plots treated with the combination\nof chemical fertilizers and green manure, particularly\nL+GY+CC/CE/B.  This reiterates the fact that the\ntreatments are improving the characteristics of the\nrecovering soil (Alves &amp; Souza, 2008), resulting in\nplant with better development in the fertilized plots.\n\nIt was observed that the species Machaerium\nacutifolium is not competitive since other plants were\nfound around the matrix plant, and it can be stated\nthat it provides conditions for the development of other\nspecies.  No other plant of the same species was found\nnear the matrix plant, making it evident that the\nexperimental area (recovering environment) created\nbeneficial conditions for the establishment of species,\nonce the area under study had been recovering for 17\nyears, resulting in better conditions in relation to the\nones found outside the experiment.  In Table 5 the\ntreatments with most plants can be observed, which\nmeans that the plots of those treatments were nearer\nthe matrix plant.  Spontaneous occurrence seemed to\nbe more related to this proximity than to the treatments.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. The soil physical proprieties are being recovered\nand soil macroporosity, total porosity and bulk density\nwere good indicators of the soil quality.\n\nTable 5.
