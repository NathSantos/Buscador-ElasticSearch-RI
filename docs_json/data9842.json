With time, the use of heavier material is being replaced by lighter materials such as advanced steel alloys, aluminium alloys and composites. The lighter the structures the better in terms of fuel consumptions and gas emission\u2019s reduction. However, these structures have to maintain their reliability, ensuring active and passive security to vehicles passengers. Therefore, this study concentrates on studying the mechanical behaviour of aluminium tubes filled with aluminium foams under compression. The closed foams are produced through a powder metallurgical method, while the open-cell foams are produced through investment casting. This study also focuses on the study of open-cell foams embedded with polymers, silicone and epoxy, commonly called \u2019Hybrid Foams\u2019. Compression tests are made under quasi-static and dynamic conditions, and analysed with non-destructive technique (Infrared Thermography), which allows to obtain thermal images (thermogrames), used to study the deformation modes. The analyses of the results passes not only through the study of the deformation modes but also focuses on its influence in energy absorption capability, as well as in the occurrence of cracks and fractures. The results show that foam filled tubes with closed-cell, expanded inside the tube itself ( designated as in-situ), ensures a better mechanical response, due to its more stable and predictable behaviour.\nPalavras-chave\tEspumas de alum\u00ednio; Espumas abertas; Espumas fechadas; Espumas h\u00edbridas; Estruturas preenchidas com espuma; Comportamento \u00e0 compress\u00e3o; Modos de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o; Absor\u00e7\u00e3o de energia.\nresumo\tEstudos na \u00e1rea dos materiais t\u00eam desempenhado um importante papel na ind\u00fastria autom\u00f3vel.

Vehicle construction industry is one of these and its future passes through the development of reliable lightweight structures. In the past, vehicles were heavy with constructions based on solid steel. However more recently, efforts have been applied into developing lightweight structures which allow cost-effective solutions with high energy absorption efficiency. Simultaneously they allow lighter structures, diminishing fuel consumption and becoming more environmental friendly.\nThe lightweight structures have been developed and tested with a combination of different materials such as advanced steels, light metals (e.g. aluminium, magnesium and their alloys) and cellular materials (e.g. polymeric and metallic foams). As it is well known, the cellular materials exhibit a very a long flat plateau (i.e. constant stress) stress-strain curve up to a strain known as the densification strain, deforming layer by layer when subjected to compressive loads. Thus, they can absorb a maximum of mechanical energy without exceeding a certain stress limit due to plastic, irreversible deformation over a large strain range. This property (energy absorption capability) makes them almost ideal crash absorbers in which the key requirement of crash protection is to absorb and dissipate energy. In an impact, the crushed structure must dissipate the energy of the impact whilst ensuring that the occupants of the vehicle are not subjected to excessive accelerations/forces, and that the \"survivable\" zone within the car remains intact. This energy dissipation is achieved through plastic work done in deforming the material in the crash structure. The metallic foams, in particular aluminium alloy foams have been tested for this purpose to protect the occupants and reduce the risk of serious injury in the event of a collision. The researchers in this field believe that these materials can contribute to construct light, safe and environmentally-friendly vehicles. More specifically, such foams can contribute to reduce the vehicle weight, increase the passive safety in case of an accident, protecting the compartment of the passengers and increase the active safety, avoiding the noise and the vibration while driving.\nThese foams are normally incorporated into hollow structures made of light metals, in particular thin-walled tubes which are widely used as key components in automotive body parts. In these composite structures, the hollow structures ensure the high mechanical strength, while the foam filler mainly contribute to the high crashworthi\nness. Several studies have been published in this field. Most of these studies have been conducted on steel tubes filled with Al-alloy foams in which the foams are cut from large panels of the foams and bonded by polymeric adhesives. Other joining processes (e.g. welding, brazing and soldering) have been also tested in order to ensure a strong bonding between the foam filler and the inner wall of the hollow structures. Results have demonstrated that the cellular structures are damaged during these processes and are not suitable to fabricate foam filled tubes (FFTs). Moreover, this additional joining step makes the process expensive, resulting in non-competitive products. Alternatively, the University of Aveiro (Portugal), University of Maribor (Slovenia) and University of Split (Croatia) have been developed and tested lightweight, recyclable, non-inflammable foam filled tubes (FFTs) made of light Al-alloys, exploring the potentiality of the powder compact foaming method (PCF, as called powder metallurgy method). Cylindrical exsitu FFTs and in-situ FFTs have developed using the PCF method by inserting the preformed aluminium alloy (Al-alloy) integral-skin foam filler into an empty Al-alloy tube and by filling the Al-alloy empty tube with Al-alloy foam during its formation, respectively. The results have demonstrated that in-situ FFTs have a superior mechanical performance and that they ensure high ductility and very good crashworthiness behaviour since they deform under compressive and bending loads without formation of cracks and without abrupt failure. Additionally, the results have shown that a good interface bonding between the foam core and the tube is a pre-requisite for better mechanical response of the composite structure.\nThe present work carried out within this international cooperation in which the aim is to develop energy absorbing lightweight structures based on cellular metals with a reliable and predictable mechanical behaviour and failure. In this work, the use of closed-cell Al-alloy integral-skin foams (prepared by powder compact foaming) and open-cell aluminium foams (fabricated by investment casting) were exploited as filler materials of thin-walled tubes. Moreover, hybrid foams are also studied as alternative filler materials of thin-walled tubes in which the open-cell foam is embedded with a polymer (e.g. epoxy and silicone, the polymers studied in this work). The study is performed on FFTs having a different geometry, i.e. square shape instead cylindrical geometry, since the performance of these tubular structures could be improved by optimizing their shape (e.g. cylindrical, rectangular and square). This also allows to broaden the crush performance knowledge of these advantageous FFTs to axial compressive loads and to study their stability and deformation predictability. The quasi-static and dynamic crush performance of the different FFTs was evaluated by uniaxial compression tests supported by the infrared thermography (IR), revealing their deformation and failure mechanisms. The compressive performance of the different FFTs was compared with the individual components (foam filler and thin-walled tubes), as well as to each other.\n1.2\tObjectives\nThe goal of the research of the international cooperation between the UA/UM/US in this research topic is to develop light filled structures based on cellular metals (e.g. advanced pore morphology foam elements, metallic hollow spheres, open-cell and closed-cell foams) with a predictable mechanical behaviour and failure that is needed for applications where optimised responses are of crucial importance.\nHerein, the aim of this study is evaluated the effect of fillers based on open and closed-cell aluminium foams on the quasi-static and dynamic crush response and energy absorption performances of aluminium alloy square thin-walled tubes. More specifically, simple open-cell foams, hybrid foams (open-cell foams embedded with epoxy and with silicone), as well closed-cell foams were studied as fillers of Al-alloy square tubes. The resulting structures were compared each other and as well as their individual components (tube and fillers). Quasi-static and dynamic axial crush performance of such foam-filled structures was studied by uniaxial compressive tests coupled with infrared thermography, exploring their deformation and failure mechanisms. The foam-filled tubes, empty tubes and foams are compared in terms of the main mechanical parameters (e.g. plateau stress, the yield stress and densification strain), maximum load carrying capacity, crush energy absorption, specific energy absorption and deformation modes. The mechanical analysis was made based on standard ISO 13314: 2011 standard for cellular materials. By comparing the capacity for energy dissipation of different FFTs, and considering their density, it was possible to assess which materials provide optimal energy dissipation per unit mass - \"specific energy absorption\". A detailed understanding of the deformation modes and failure of these FFTs was also one of the goals of this work. As it well-known that ideal energy absorbing structures should exhibit a high energy absorption capacity, deforming under crush loads without the crack formation, which is a pre-requisite for good crashworthiness behaviour.\n1.3\tOutline\nThis thesis is organised into five main chapters.

Since ever humanity followed several natural mechanisms. Even in Greek mythology, Icarus tried to fly with wings, inspired by the birds. In the same way, nowadays humanity is inspired once again in nature, developing mechanisms and systems. This particular example, foams, exist naturally by nature, the commonly called cellular structures. They can take many forms, representing an important role in ecosystems. Imagine bee's hives figure 2.1(a), visible to the human eye, with their ultralight honeycombs. Another every-day cellular that exists are trees, more specifically wood (figure 2.1(b)) and cork structures (figure 2.1(c)). Trees can be huge and massive structures, with thousands of branches and climbing animals. Besides this, they can withstand floods and floor instabilities at the same time that they support wind and storms.\n(b) (c)\nFigure 2.1: Examples of cellular structures in nature: (a) Honeycombs [1],(b) Wood structure [2] and (c) Cork structure [3].\nEven the human body has foams inside its bones, called Trabecular bone (figure 2.2) 1. It is softer than the outsider bone, however it is responsible for ensuring the stability. All of these materials mentioned above are porous but still very strong supporting high loads. They belong to a group of materials called cellular solid materials.\n1 Also known as Spongy bone due to its structure.\nFigure 2.2: Trabecular bone [4].\nThat is exactly what man did. Man started to develop similar materials in laboratory, but made from a metal, a polymer, a glass and a ceramic. Over the last 20 years, we have witnessed a growing interest in the field of cellular materials in general and particularly in cellular metals by industry, especially in Europe, China and United States of America. These cellular metals are available as closed-cell and open-cell foams, hollow-sphere foams, syntactic foams, composite and nano-composite foams, periodic and optimized truss structures and engineering honeycombs. The term \"solid foam\" refers to a class of materials in which the material is continuous and the gaseous pores are dispersed from the solid (e.g. metal). However, the attribution of this term to a material is mainly related to the porosity level. Normally, a material is considered a foam when when its porosity level is superior to 70%, e.g. a material with a porosity level of 80% is constituted by 20% of metallic material and 80% of empty spaces pores.\nThese cellular metals, in particular the metal foams can be used as functional or structural materials, mainly depending of their cellular structures (open-pore or closed-pores). These materials are lighter than traditional dense solid material and more functional than other cellular materials (e.g. polymer foams). They can be used in numerous industrial applications, such as lightweight structures, impact energy absorbers, biomedical devices and implants, filters, electrodes, catalysts and heat exchangers.\nAs mentioned above, there are two groups of metal foams: open and closed-cell foams, as shown in figure 2.3(a) and figure 2.3(b), respectively.\nOpen-cell foams are characterized as foams in which the cells are interconnected by cell edges or ligaments. They have a very high specific surface area, a very good thermal and electrical conductivity, a good permeability that makes them effective for functional engineering applications. They are extensively used as heat exchangers, filters, electrodes, shock absorbers, etc., taking advantages of their high specific surface area and high thermal and electrical conductivities. Closed-cell foams are characterized by isolated pores separated from each other by cell-walls. These foams have high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios, high impact energy absorbing capacity and/or with a good damping of noise and vibration. They are mainly used for structural engineering applications (e.g., automotive, aerospace, industrial equipment and building construction).\nFigure 2.3: Different types of foams:\n(a) Open-cell [5], (b) and closed-cell [6].\n2.1.1\tManufacturing methods\nThere are several ways to produce metallic foams. Banhart in 2001 published a review paper where the main manufacturing methods are described. He divided the manufacturing methods according to the initial state of the metal (e.g. melt and powder). Here, only the most relevant methods currently used to fabricate and commercialise these materials are presented [7].\nOpen-cell foams are usually prepared by replicating an open-cell polymeric foams (e,g. polyurethane foams), called investment casting, as illustrated in figure 2.4. The polymeric foam is impregnated by a ceramic slurry (e.g. mixture of mullite, phenolic resin and calcium carbonate). After drying, the polymer is burnt out by heating in an atmosphere (air), resulting a porous ceramic material. Then, the molten metal (e.g. aluminium alloy melt) is poured into the ceramic porous. The metal is cooled and the ceramic porous is removed by mechanical or chemical dissolution. The process should be controlled to avoid the damage of the ceramic porous during the infiltration of the metal molten that are normally performed under high pressures and temperatures. Also, the removing the ceramic material must be carefully made to avoid the damage of the resulting metal foam. The method allows fabricating perfect replicates of the original polymer foam used, achieving porosities in the range of 80% to 97%. These foams are commercialized according to the grades that are given in pores per inch (ppi). This is the method used to fabricate the open-cell aluminium foams studied in this work. This type of foams is usually used for functional engineering applications, like heat exchangers, filters, electrodes. Herein, the open-cell foams are combined to the polymers for studying their application as core of the empty tubes for structural engineering applications.\nFigure 2.4: Investment casting manufacturing process of open-cell foam.\n\n\nClosed-cell foams metal foams are usually fabricated using direct and indirect foaming methods for scale commercial exploitation. The direct foaming methods (figure 2.5)consist in the preparation of a foam by directly injecting a gas (e.g. argon) or by adding a blowing agent (e.g. titanium hydride) into a molten metal (e.g. aluminium) containing uniformly dispersed ceramic particles (e.g. silicon carbide and calcium). In the first method, the gas is injected and the its bubbles are dispersed into the melt using a rotating impellers or ultrasound oscillations. Ceramic particles (5-20 vol.%) are previously added to increase the viscosity of the melt and to stabilize the liquid cell walls. The bubbles rise to the top of the melt, where the formed foamy mass (liquid foam) is continuously draw off by means a conveyor belt or filled closed moulds, solidifying after leaving the furnace. An additional upper conveyor belt is used to control the thickness of foam panel. The liquid foam can also fill closed moulds directly, producing complex shaped foam parts. Nowadays, these foams are commercialized by Cymat (Canada) and Aluivent (Hungary) which use rotating impellers or ultrasound oscillations to form the bubbles into the melt, respectively. The ultrasound oscillations allow a better control of the pore size distribution, achieving a much lower pore size. This method allows fabricating long foam panels. For example, panels with 1m in width and thickness range of 25-150 mm can be produced at production rates of 900 kg/hour. The main disadvantage is the brittle behaviour that these foams exhibit due to high content of ceramic particles used. This method can produce foams with an average pore 2.5-30 mm and size relative density within the range 0.05-0.55 g/cm3. Another alternative way, the gas bubbles can be generated chemically by the thermal decomposition of a blowing agent into the melt. Firstly, the calcium powder (1.5 wt.%) is previously added to the melt at high temperatures, followed by several minutes stirring to adjust the viscosity. The increase of viscosity is achieved by the formation of calcium oxides. After that, the powder of blowing agent is quickly dispersed into the melt under mechanical stirring. In direct contact to the high temperatures of the melt, the particles of blowing agent decompose releasing a gas (hydrogen in the case of TiH2) into the hot viscous liquid. The foaming process takes place into the moulds at constant pressure. After cooling the mould, the foam solidifies and is removed from the mould. The foam block is sliced into flat plates with desired thickness according to its end use. This process can produce large foam blocks (450 mm in width, 2050 mm in length and 650 mm in height). The density range of these foams is 0.18-0.24 gcm3, and the pore size is about 4.5 mm. This method is more expensive than the foaming melts by gas injection method and requires a more complex processing equipment. Moreover, these foams have uniform pore structure and do not require the addition of ceramic particles, which makes it brittle. These foams are commercialized by Foamtech (Korea). [8].\nFigure 2.5: Gas injection and dispersion [9].\nAs an alternative to these direct foaming methods, the powder metallurgical method (also called compact foaming technique) is the most indirect method commercially exploited to produce structures based on closed-cell metal foams. This is the method used to produce the closed-cell metal foams studied in this work. Figure 2.6 shows a scheme of this manufacturing process which was developed and patented by the Fraunhofer Institute (in Bremen, Germany). This method is divided into three main manufacturing steps (1-3). In the first step (step I, figure 2.6), a powder mixture of a metal powder (e.g. aluminium, magnesium and zinc) and a small amount of a blowing agent powder (e.g. typically 0.5-1 wt.% of titanium hydride) is prepared using conventional mixers (e.g. tumbling mixers). The blowing agents used to prepare foams are usually metal hydrides (e.g. TiH2 and MgH2), but other alternative blowing agent (e.g. CaCO3) has been investigated as an effective-cost alternative. The characteristics of the blowing agent used (e.g. particle size) are crucial to the quality of the resulting foam. For example, some studies revealed that the use of coarser or finer particle sizes of TiH2 leads to foams larger or smaller pore sizes, respectively.\nThe second step (step II, figure 2.6), the mixture powder is hot compacted using a combination of conventional compaction techniques (e.g. hot/cold uniaxial pressing, cold isostatic pressing and hot extrusion), resulting a dense semi compacted called foamable precursor material that can be processed into sheets, rods and profiles. The compacting processes could be carried out under different atmospheres (e.g. air, vacuum). The density of these foamable precursor materials must be closed to the density of the aluminium matrix (no residual open porosity).\nThe third step, the foamable precursor material is heated to temperatures close to the melting temperature of the metal matrix, resulting a liquid metal foam. The metal expands developing a highly internal porous structure of closed pores due to the simultaneous melting of the metal and the thermal decomposition of the blowing agent in gas. The solid foams are simple obtained by cooling the formed liquid foam at temperatures below to the melting temperature.\n(1)\t(2)\t(3)\nmetal powder\tmixing\ttwo stage compacting\theat treatment\nFigure 2.6: Fraunhofer Process \u00ae.\nFoams parts prepared by this method have a highly internal structure with closed-cells and are covered by a dense metal skin that provides a good surface finish and improves their mechanical properties. The main advantage of this method is the possibility to fabricate foam parts without limitations concerning shape (e.g. panels, filled profiles, 3D complex shaped foam parts), figure 2.7. This is due to the foaming process, which can take place into closed or open moulds, or even into hollow structures (e.g. thin-walled tubes) in which the cavity of the mould has the same dimensions and design of the final foam part. This method also allows joining the metal foams with other ma\nterials (e.g. screws and nuts) during the formation of the liquid metal foam, eliminating the joining step. Thus, fasteners or standard parts used in vehicles (i.e. nuts, bolts, pin rivets) could be incorporated into the metal foam, which is an opportunity to simplify and improve vehicles components [10]. Based on this method, sandwich panels can also be produced by hot rolling a precursor into the sheets before foaming step. This PM method allows producing foams of different metal and its alloys (e.g. aluminium, steel, tin or gold). Foams with porosities between 75% and 90% can be produced by this process, which is actually commercialized by Pohltec Metalfoam (Germany).\nFigure 2.7: Complex foam part made with aluminium foam [11].\nRecently, Advanced Pore Morphology (APM) foam elements prepared by this PM method have become of interest due to their easily reproducible simple geometry and consistent mechanical and physical properties. APM foams (figure 2.8(a)) are also conventional foams (with skin) prepared by the same method, but much smaller in size and spherical (2 to 15 mm). These APM foams are prepared by heating small rectangular precursor elements in a continuous belt furnace. During the foaming process, the initial rectangular precursor element shape changes to a near-spherical shape. The small element\u2019s size ensures that surface tension forces during melting are relatively large compared to the hydrostatic pressure, allowing formation of near spherical shapes. The APM foams could be also coated by a polymeric adhesive (e.g. polyamide), allowing their easily commercialisation. They have been tested as filler of thin-walled tubes (figure 2.8(b)) to prepare efficient energy absorbing structures for automobiles vehicles [12-15].\n(a)\t(b)\nFigure 2.8: (a) APM foam morphology [13] and (b) foam application [14].\n2.1.2\tProperties\nThe open-cell and closed-cell metal foams are light-weight, recyclable, non-inflammable materials. Their properties combine the properties of cellular materials (open and closed pores) with the properties of the metals. Some properties of these foams are the exactly the same to the properties of the metal matrix (e.g. melting temperature), but the mechanical, thermal, electrical properties are changed. The properties of these foams are influenced by morphological parameters (e.g. pore size, closed or open pore, defects in the cell-walls). These morphological parameters depend on the manufacturing process used to produce the foams. Table 2.1 lists the main properties of the foams prepared by the main commercial manufacturing methods described above [7,16,17].\nThe properties, in particular the mechanical properties depend mainly on the foam density, but are also influenced by the cellular structure parameters, such as pore size, pore type (closed or open pores) and defects in the cell-walls. It is well-known that the mechanical properties are degraded with the presence of the defects and structural imperfections.\nTable 2.1: Mechanical properties of some metal foams, adapted from [17].\nProperty\tAlulight\tDuocel\tAlporas\nMaterial [ - ]\tAl\tAl\tAl\nStructure [ - ]\tclosed cell\topen cell\tclosed cell\nDensity [kg/m3]\t300-700\t160-250\t200-250\nRelative density [ - ]\t0.1-0.35\t0.05-0.1\t0.08-0.1\nYoung's modulus [GPa]\t1.7-12\t0.06-0.3\t0.4-1\nPoisson's coefficient [ - ]\t\t0.31-0.34\t\nCompressive strength [MPa]\t1.9-14\t0.9-3\t1.3-1.7\nTensile Strength [MPa]\t2.2-30\t1.6-1.9\t1.6-1.9\nDensification strain [ - ]\t0.4-0.8\t0.7-0.82\t0.7-0.82\nThe mechanical properties have been evaluated using uniaxial compression tests under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. The metal foams, in particular the closedcell foams are good energy absorbers due to the exhibition of a long plateau region in the compression curve. Figure 2.9(b) shows a typical compressive stress-strain curve measured for these foams. The compressive stress-strain curve is divided into three regions: linear elastic, plateau and densification. In the first region, the deformation is controlled by cell wall bending and/or stretching depending on the structure of the foams - open or closed foams - figure 2.9(a). The compressive stress-strain relationships of the integral\u2014skin foams subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions are presented in figure 2.9(b). The diagram shows a typical compressive behaviour of foams, composed of three distinct regions:\n\u2022\t(I) the linear elastic region in which the deformation is controlled by cell wall bending and/or stretching;\n\u2022\t(II) an extended plastic collapse plateau region with a nearly constant stress, where the foam cell walls bend, buckle, yield and fracture;\n\u2022\t(III) densification region [18].\nOpen-cell foam deforms mainly by cell wall bending, followed cell wall axial deformation. Besides cell edge deformation, the thin membranes of the closed pores which form the cell faces, stretch normal to the compression axis increasing stiffness. If the membranes do not rupture, the compression of the gas trapped within the cells increases the stiffness, so, the Young modulus increases with the foam density. The closed-cell foams deform by cell wall bending and contraction, membrane stretching and enclosed gas pressure.\nFigure 2.9: Representation of foams deformation: (a) Cell wall deformation due to compression , adapted from [18] and (b), different deformation stages of foams.\nStrain[-]\n(b)\nDue to their low relative density, foams are very interesting energy absorbers. Once that an incredible amount of energy can be absorbed by the structure,comparatively to their weight. Energy absorption depends not only of relative density but also of pore size, existing imperfections and possible defects in porous structure [19].\n2.1.3\tApplications\nDepending of the cellular structure, the foams are used as functional and structural engineering applications. Figure 2.10 shows an overview of the different applications depending of the type of pore.\nopen\tpartially open\tclosed\ntype of porosity\nFigure 2.10: Foam applications according to their porosity [7].\nThe open-cell metal foams with interconnected porosity are extensively used as heat exchangers, filters, electrodes, shock absorbers, etc., taking advantages of their high specific surface area and high thermal and electrical conductivities. Figure 2.11 shows some real applications [20, 21].\n(b)\nFigure 2.11: (a) A small heat exchanger to thermally stabilize the lens of an electron scanning microscope and (b), aluminium foam core mirror utilized in space communications.\nThe closed-cell foams are used as a lightweight, energy absorption and damping insulation structures for different industrial sectors (automotive, building construction, naval and design and architecture). Figure 2.12 and figure 2.13 show some real applications of these closed-cell aluminium foams. The ideal application of these materials is in the transport industry. The incorporation of these materials into the automotive structures contributes to reduce the weight of the vehicle, to increase the active safety in case of an accident protecting the compartment of the passengers and to increase the passive safety, avoiding the noise and the vibration during the drive [20]. The closed-cell foams have been tested to improve structural protection against ballistic impact from projectiles or blast protection from explosives in military applications for lightweight armour systems (e.g. vehicles and bullet-proof vest) [22]. The results have also shown that these foams exhibit significant non-linear deformation and stress-wave attenuation during high speed impacts.\n(b)\nFigure 2.12: Foam application in: (a) automotive components [23], and (b) in military equipment [24].\n(a)\nRegardless of automotive industry, closed-cell foams have another applications such as civil engineering or simply art and decoration. The first, figure 2.13(a) is the new building of Prada foundation in Milano. As for figure 2.13(b), it is a simple geology cabinet.\n(a)\t(b)\nFigure 2.13: Foam application in (a) civil engineering [25] and (b) in art [26].\n2.2\tThin-walled tubes\nThin-walled tubes, also known empty tubes (figure 2.14), with different geometries (e.g. cylindrical, rectangular, square, tapered, hat-section and cone) made of different materials (e.g. steel and aluminium) are applied in all industrial sectors (e.g. equipment construction, building construction and automotive sector). For example, these tubes are the main structural components used as impact energy absorbers in the automotive vehicles due to their ability to deform in a stable, progressive axial manner.\nFigure 2.14: Tubes with different sections.\nThere are several qualitative criteria needed to characterise the energy absorption capacity of energy absorbing structures which are well-known and defined. Such criteria are primarily used in the initial design stage of energy absorbing systems. For example, energy absorption, specific energy absorption, mean crush load, crush force efficiency, energy absorbed per unit crush length, deformation capacity are some of these parameters [27,29]. The major energy absorbing characteristics described here are:\n\u2022 Energy absorption\nThe load-displacement response of energy absorbing structures allows measuring their energy absorption performance. Energy absorption (W) is defined as an integration of a load-displacement curve, W= j/max f (S') dS where F is an instantaneous crushing load, S the displacement. From this equation, the mean crush load (Pmean) is calculated using equation 2.1.\n1 fs\nFmean =\tFS dS\t(2.1)\nS\tJ 0\nAn ideal energy absorber can be represented with a constant crushing load, Pmax from the onset of the crushing process up to the maximum Smax. Thus, the energy absorption capacity corresponds to the rectangular area of a load-displacement curve.\n\u2022 Specific Energy absorption\nThe most important characteristic of energy absorbers is the specific energy absorption capacity, WS (equation 2.2). The specific energy absorption (WS) is\ndefined by energy absorbed per unit mass where W is the absorbed energy and m is the original non-deformed mass.\nm\n(2.2)\nIn the fact, Ws is the most common performance parameter for energy absorbing structures to assess the energy absorbing capacity particularly when weight reduction is extremely important. The WS is also used as an indicator of the weight efficiency of an energy absorber. For a given absorbed energy, a higher Ws indicates a more efficient crush absorber in terms of its weight. However, the weight-saving does not comprise safety or structural performance.\n\u2022 Mean crush load\nThe mean crush load (Pmean) for a given deformation is defined as the total energy absorbed (Wt) divided by the total deformation, 6 (equation 2.3.\nmean\nWt\n\u00d4\n(2.3)\nThe mean load is also an indicator of energy absorbing capability of a structure when compared to the axial displacement required to absorb the energy. For the crush response of thin-walled tubes, the load fluctuates throughout the crushing process. The maximum peak load (first initial peak load) gives an indication of the load required to initiate collapse and hence begin the energy absorption process. For practical implications, these two parameters, mean crush load and initial peak load are the important parameters in evaluating the energy absorption performance of energy absorbers.\n\u2022\tCrush force efficiency\nThe crush force efficiency, defined by n =Pmean/Ppeak, measures the uniformity of the crush loads. For an ideal energy absorber, the crush force efficiency should be as close to 100% as possible. From a crashworthiness point of view, high crush force efficiency is desirable. An energy absorber may be able to absorb a required energy, represented by the mean load, but may be impractical because the load required to initiate crush might be too high. To overcome this problem, a trigger mechanism is introduced to reduce the initial peak load leading to an increase of the crush force efficiency.\n\u2022\tEnergy absorbed per unit crush length\nThe energy absorbed per unit crush length (Wci) is determined using the absorption energy divided by either the non-deformed length or the maximum crush distance of the energy absorber. The parameter becomes important for cases where the available crush zone is limited.\n\u2022 Stroke efficiency\nThe stroke efficiency is defined as the ratio between the maximum allowable crush distance (dmax) and the initial length (L). This is a good indicator of the amount of material used to absorb the kinetic impact energy during an impact.\n\u2022 Dynamic amplification factor\nThe Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) is an additional crush criterion when comparing the energy absorption capacity of structures under quasi static and dynamic loading conditions. The dynamic amplification factor is defined by the ratio of energy absorbed under dynamic loading (Wdyn) and energy absorbed under static loading (Wstat).\nIn the following section, an overview of the crush mechanical performance of cylindrical and square thin-walled tubes, including their deformation modes is presented. This work focused on the study of square thin-walled tubes.\n2.2.1\tCrush performance of thin-walled tubes\nThe crush performance of the thin-walled tubes has been extensively studied using experimental and numerical studies. Most of the studies have been performed using uniaxial compression tests under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. From these studies, it was concluded that the manner in which a thin-walled tube deforms depends on the tube's material (e.g. chemical composition and mechanical properties) and geometry (e.g. cross-section, diameter, wall thickness and height).\nFigure 2.15: Scheme of compression behaviour of thin-walled tube [27].\nFigure 2.15 shows a typical compressive stress-strain curve of a thin-walled tube under axial loading. The compressive curve is usually divided into three regions. The initial linear region characterised by Young's Modulus (E) which is usually determined from the slope of the curve, characterises the stiffness of the material. Then, the stress increases slowly until reached the yield point (first peak load/stress). After that, a load drop region reaching the minimum stress value, followed by load oscillations with a gradual trend of increase in the load/stress values, and the densification region in\nwhich the load/stress increases abruptly. For the crush response of thin-walled tubes, the load/stress in general fluctuates throughout the crushing process and the highest initial load point is defined as the initial peak load/stress (A - peak). For cylindrical thin-walled tubes, the buckling force corresponds to the first peak, while the buckling force is not necessarily the first peak for the square thin-walled tubes.\nThe cylindrical thin-walled tubes can deform in axisymmetric (concertina mode), non-axisymmetric (diamond mode) or mixed mode pattern, or even global bending. Figure 2.16 shows the final deformed tubes, showing the concertina (at left) and diamond (center and right) modes. These different deformation modes depends on the ratio of diameter to wall thickness (D/t), but also on the ratio of length to the diameter (L/D), as illustrated in figure 2.17.\nFigure 2.16: Concertina deformation mode (left) and diamond deformation mode (center and right) [28].\nFor certain values of D/t ratio, a tube may start collapse with the concertina mode and then switch to the diamond mode, hence exhibiting a mixed mode. The transition of the deformation mode from axisymmetric to non-symmetric depends on the D/t ratio, but also the hardening characteristics of the tube\u2019s material [28,29].There are even diagrams that classify and associate the deformation modes with the geometrical parameters of tubes (figure 2.17) for each type of material. Andrews et al. [30] constructed charts, also called deformation maps relating the deformation modes of empty tubes with their geometrical parameters (D/t and L/D) under uniaxial compression loads. These studies were usually focusing on determining the parameters that control the collapse mode of empty tubes under compression loads [28,30]. Many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the thin-walled tubes made of Al-alloys (e.g. 6060 T5, 6061 T6, 6260 T4 and carbon steel [31]) with different ratios of D/t and L/D. The tubes can collapse in an efficient (either in axisymmetric concertina mode, non-axisymmetric - diamond mode or mixed mode pattern) or inefficient manner (e.g. global bending or buckling). The results reported in literature have demonstrated that the thicker tubes usually deform in an axisymmetric (concertina mode), while thinner tubes deform in a non-axisymmetric (diamond mode). Furthermore, empty tubes with a low ratio of diameter to wall thickness (D/t &lt;80) and material insensitive to strain hardening deform in an axisymmetric concertina mode, while tubes with a high D/t (D/t > 80) and material sensitive to strain hardening deform generally in a non-axisymmetric (diamond mode). Moreover, when its length is greater than the critical length for a given tube, it deforms in the overall Euler buckling mode, which is an inefficient energy mode [28,29].\nThe number of the folds and the localization of the initial folding layer (e.g. middle, lower or upper ends) also depend on the geometrical parameters (e.g. wall thickness,\ndiameter and height) and the material characteristics [10]. The number of the folds usually increases by increasing the height of the tubes. Basically, the cylindrical tube starts to deform in the weak region, creating the first fold. When the first fold is completely compressed, the stress increases again which leads to formation of the second fold. The process is repeated constantly, while the peaks of the stress in the stressstrain diagram represent the number of folds. The first peak is normally higher than the successive peaks.\nRecent studies [32] have demonstrated that thin-walled tubes made of 6061 T66 submitted to a heat treatment (700\u00b0C) start to deform in middle of the sample, while without treatment start to deform in one of the ends (lower or upper end) at both (quasi-static and dynamic) loading conditions. Also, no cracks are observed during the folding of heat treated tubes (figure 2.18(b)), but are observed in the untreated tubes (figure 2.18(a)), only at the end of the compression tests. Together with deformation of the folding, these untreated tubes (figure 2.18(a)) develop many cracks mainly aligned in the direction of loading at the early stages of the deformation.\n(a)\t(b)\nFigure 2.18: Deformed specimens of (a) untreated tube and (b) treated tube [32]).\nThe propagation of the cracks occurs through all the loading process due to the stress concentrations in crack tips. The oscillation of the stresses observed in region oscillation stress up to the densification region seems to be related to the propagation of the cracks. The formation of cracks is related to the micro-structure and the hardening characteristics of the material the empty tubes are made of. Tubes fold but do not avoid the stress concentrations that are severe enough to initiate cracking. This is related to the ductility of metals that refers to its ability to deform under tensile stress. After the formation of the fold, some material in the fold region experiences tensile stress which leads to development of cracks. The localization of the fold (middle, lower and upper ends) also depends on the hardening characteristics of the material. The deformed specimens also show a slight distortion and an irregular fold form. The structural changes induced by the heat treatment of treated tubes (figure 2.18(b)) thus positively affect their crashworthiness and the ductility, ensuring that the treated tubes fold without stress concentrations severe enough to initiate cracking (figure 2.18(b)). The results have demonstrated that the treated tubes have a postponed failure and damage progression region after passing the yield point in comparison to the untreated tubes.\nSimilarly to the cylindrical thin-walled tubes, Abramowicz and Jones in 1984 and 1986 classified and grouped the deformation and failure modes of square thin-walled tubes into three groups: symmetric collapse mode(also called stable), asymmetric mixed collapse mode(also called unstable) and extensional collapse mode (also called unstable) [33,34].\nAlso, Wierzbicki and Abramowicz for evaluating the static and progressive buckling of thin-walled square tubes identified two basic collapse elements as illustrated in figure 2.19. Type I (figure 2.19(a)), when the buckle goes inwards, and Type II (figure 2.19(b)) when the buckle goes outward. Considering this, there are six different progressive buckling modes which are shown in figures 2.20, 2.21 and 2.21(c) [29,34,35].\nFigure 2.19: Collapse modes configuration: (a) Type I and (b) Type II .\nTo be considered symmetric the layer can present all the lobes inwards (figure 2.20(a)), two opposite lobes inwards and two opposite lobes outwards (figure 2.20(b)) or three lobes inwards and one lobe outward (figure 2.20(c)). However, despite the differences between them, all are considered to have similar behaviours and all the developed lobes present similar responses whether the square tube suffers dynamic or static load, resulting in similar crushing loads and energy absorption characteristics.\nFigure 2.20: Symmetric deformation modes: (a) 4 inward lobes , (b) 2 inward lobes and (c) 1 inward lobe.\nAs for the asymmetric mode, there are two main modes, \u2019A\u2019 and \u2019B\u2019. The asymmetric mode A presents a layer with three lobes deforming outwards and one inwards (figure 2.21(a)), while the deformation mode B presents two adjacent lobes deforming outwards and the other two deforming inwards (figure 2.21(b)). The asymmetric mode can induce bending. Abramowicz et al. in 1986 [34] concluded that this is related to the presence of initial imperfections, being independent of the tube initial length. Despite the figures show flatten lobes, they don't really flatten completely during crush, presenting some circular edges [34]. The last one, extensional mode, is characterized by 4 fours outwards (figure 2.21(c)).\nFigure 2.21: Asymmetric deformation modes: (a) mode A and (b) mode B; (c) extensional deformation mode.\nLikewise, there are diagrams that classify and associate the deformation modes with the geometrical parameters of square tubes [27] for each type of material, as illustrated in figure 2.22 for mild steel. The dotted curve in this figure shows the boundary between unstable and stable areas derived by using the empirical formula proposed by Abramow-icz and Jones [36] on the basis of the experimental results for mild steel. This type of diagram is important to design a tubular structures for ensuring a stable and efficient axial crushing.\nPrevious studies concluded that relatively short tubes deform through progressive buckling. With length increase, bending effects become more probable. Fyllingen (2012)\nFigure 2.22: Map of square tubes deformation, adapted from [27].\net al. also concluded that eccentricity development is the reason to global bending transition and that this one is a function of a transition zone from extensional to symmetric lobes. Another possible reason to global bending is unequal crush on different sides of the tube, promoting eccentricity development [37,38].\nGlobal bending can also occur due to imperfections. These cause fragilities in the material, becoming sensitive zones. Similarly, when tubes are suffering compression, they sometimes fracture. These fractures act as imperfections and become sensitive zones in which bending is more probable to happen [33,37].\n2.2.2\tApplications\nThin-walled tubes are widely used as structural components in several industrial sectors, such as building construction, aerospace and transportation sector. Two real applications are shown in figure 2.24. These tubular structures with various geometrical shapes (circular, rectangular, square, tapered, hat-section and cone) are widely used as impact energy absorbers in automotive and aerospace industry due to their ability to deform in a stable, progressive axial manner.\n(b)\nFigure 2.24: Thin-walled tubes made of aluminium alloys applications in:(a) automotive industry [39] and (b) construction structures [40].\nIn more recent years, the environmental concerns, recycling and energy saving has opened the need for construction lighter buildings and lighter vehicles with more fuelefficiency, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These have opened the door for introduction of new materials to the market as an alternative to the heavier materials, offering lighter materials and more environmentally friendly future vehicles. Nowadays, light metals (e.g. advanced steels, aluminium and its alloys and magnesium and its alloys) are widely used to replace the heavier materials (e.g. traditional steels). As it well-known, the metals are 100% recyclable and can be infinitely recycled, allowing the creation of new products without loss of mechanical strength. The most recent promising effective material is aluminium and its alloys due to its excellent properties like, weight saving, ensuring fuel consumption, pollution reduction, improvement of certain safety and driving performance , high corrosion resistance, good weld ability, etc.\n2.3\tFoam filled tubes\nThere has been growing interesting in light foam filled tubes (FFTs) as efficient energy absorbing structures where the thin-walled tubes are filling with lightweight cellular materials (e.g. metal foams and polymeric foams). A number of researchers [41-43] carried out extensive experimental, numerical and analytical studies on the quasi-static and dynamic compressive and bending behaviour of these FFTs. The lightweight foam filler is able to stabilise the cross section of thin-walled tube and retards the local sectional collapse at the compression wall, leading to a significant improve of the load carrying capacity and energy absorption. The foam filler not only absorbs kinetic energy by its own compressive plastic deformation, but also helps the surrounding metal shell spread plastic deformation over a larger bending zone by its interaction with the tube walls. These FFTs take full advantages of the excellent properties of the individual components (e.g. thin-walled tube and foam filler). The tubes have an excellent capacity to absorb impact energy, deforming in a stable, progressive axial manner. The cellular materials become increasingly attractive as fillers for of empty thin-walled structures due to its ability to absorb energy under compressive and bending loads, improving the crashworthiness and safety of vehicles. They exhibit a constant stress \u2019plateau\u2019 (see section 2.1.2), absorbing higher levels of energy than dense materials. Within cellular materials, the non-inflammable, recyclable and lightweight metal foams, in particular the closed-cell aluminium alloy (Al-alloy) foams are the most promising and the most tested for this purpose. The use of aluminium and its alloys offers a considerable potential for reducing the weight of an automobile body, as explained above. Polymeric foams have limited use due to the recycling difficulty and environmental impacts, however, there are several studies using tubes filled with polymeric foams [44-46]. The Al-alloy foams are even being used as a filler material in lightweight structures subject to crash and/or high velocity impact or as thermal/ acoustic insulation devices.\nThis is even the current trend in transport industry, use of lightweight materials (e.g. aluminium, magnesium and advance steels) and integrate them into vehicle designs for improving the fuel economy efficiency and reduce the vehicle weight, without comprising other attributes such as the cost, performance, comfort, safety, corrosion and recyclability.\nThe first studies on the crush performance of foam filled tubes based on aluminium foams were carried out by Abramowicz and Wierzbicki [47], Santosa et al. [43], Hanssen et al. [48-50] and Seitzberger [41,42] and Banhart et al. [16]. The most of these first studies were carried out in steel cylindrical [41] and square [42] tubes filled with aluminium honeycomb [43] and closed-cell aluminium foams [ [48-50]]. The most of these FFTs were prepared prepared by inserting foams (without dense skin) cut from large foam panels directly into the tubes (mainly steel tubes) using adhesive bonding. Nowadays, several lightweight structures made of light metals, in particular aluminium alloy have been developed in order to obtain a strong bonding between the foam filler and the tube, avoiding the use of polymeric adhesive. Both (filler and tube) are made by Al-alloy that offer considerable potential to reduce the weight of the body-in-white. The following sections present an overview on the recent development in this field describing their manufacturing methods, properties and potential applications.\n2.3.1\tManufacturing processes\nIn the past, foam-filled tubes fabrication consisted in inserting a foam filler into the empty tubes, in which the foams are cut to required dimensions by an electrical discharge machine from large foam panels. Polymeric adhesives are usually easily used to join the filler and the tube. However, they cannot be used for applications under high-temperature conditions and cannot be used in heat-resistant or non-flammable components [51]. Moreover, the resulting structures have also limited applications due to the recycling difficulty and environmental impacts. To overcome these problems while adhesives continue being used, several other joining processes have been developed and studied. This is even one of the hot research topic in the metal foam field.\nThus, several joining process have been tested such as friction stir welding [52], fluxless soldering with surface abrasion [53], brazing [54] and soldering [55]. Nonetheless, the results have demonstrated that the cellular structures of the foams could be damaged during these joining processes (e.g. fusion welding). Authors have reported that there is still much work needed to determine suitable filler metals and proper methods to remove the oxide film on Al-alloy foams. This greatly impedes obtaining a reliable joint using the above mentioned joining processes, due to aluminium oxides appearing on the surface soon after production of machining process. These joining processes have also several limitations. For example, it is still difficult to fabricate large and geometrically complex parts, only allowing the fabrication of simple flat parts (e.g. sandwich panels joining Al-foams and flat metal sheets), as shown in figure 2.25. Furthermore, this additional step makes the process expensive, resulting in non-competitive products.\nFigure 2.25: The process of fluxless soldering with surface abrasion assisted by different vibration modes: (a) molten solder coated on aluminium foam , (b) molten solder coated on Al plate, (c) Al plate covered on aluminum foam, (d) mechanical vibration , and (e) ultrasonic vibration.\nAs an alternative method, some researchers have been exploring the powder metallurgy as a method usually used to fabricate high quality metal foam parts (e.g. Al-alloy foams) to develop new lightweight foam-filled tubes, called ex-situ FFTs [10] and in-situ FFTs [56]. The ex-situ FFTs are fabricated by simply inserting an integral-skin foam filler (figure 2.26(a)), instead of a foam without skin, with required dimensions which\nare prepared one-by-one using the powder compact foaming technique. The integralskin foams have the advantage of being covered by an external dense metal skin that improves their mechanical behaviour and, additionally, allows a good surface finish. On other hand, no cutting operation is necessary before being inserted, leading to significant reduction of the production costs. There is a air gap between the foam filler and the outer tube (figure 2.26(c)).\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2.26: Cylindrical specimens of: (a) integral-skin foams , (b) ex-situ FFT and (c) gap between the foam filler and outer tube [10].\nThe in-situ FFTs (figure 2.27) are prepared by heating the foamable precursor material inside a steel or aluminium alloy tube, thus promoting the in-situ formation of the foam and the complete filling of the tubes. However, the manufacturing conditions should be carefully adjusted in order to ensure its structural integrity avoiding its melting while exposed to high foaming temperatures close to the Al-alloy melting temperature. Duarte et al. [32] have demonstrated that Al-alloy tubes could be filled with Al-alloy foam during the foam formation, promoting a metal bonding between the foam filler and the inner tube wall, as shown in figures 2.27(b) and 2.27(c).\nFigure 2.27: Cylindrical specimens of: (a) in-situ FFTs, (b) and(c) the interface between the inner tube wall and the foam [32].\nRecently, a new approach from Hangai et al. [57,58] to prepare steel tubes filled with aluminium foam was developed by combining the powder metallurgy with friction stir welding (FSW) techniques. Figure 2.28 illustrates the schematic representation of this approach.\n(a)\t(b)\t(c)\nThermocouple\nFigure 2.28: Schematic illustration of manufacturing method of Al-alloy (ADC12)-foam filled A1050 tube by friction welding. (a) Foamable precursors set in the tube; (b) Insert of a rotating tool made of SUS304 steel; (c) Friction welding conduction; (d) ADC12-precursor bonded; (e) ADC12-foam filled with A1050 tube [58].\n(d)\t(e)\nA typical foamable precursor material is obtained by hot compacting a powder mixture of aluminium alloy powder (Al-Si-Cu die-cast aluminium alloy) and a blowing agent powder (titanium hydride) used to fabricate the aluminium alloy foams by PM method (see section 2.1.1). The first step consists on bonding two pieces of precursor to the inner wall of the steel tube by FSW technique (figure 2.28).\nFigure 2.29: Fabricated ADC12-precursor bonded A1050 tube. (a) Sample immediately after friction welding; (b) Cross section of sample in (a).\nThen, a rotating tool made of steel of 13 mm diameter is inserted into the tube from above at a feed rate of 5 mm/min and a rotation rate of 800 rpm (figure 2.28 step (b)). This rotating tool is moved downward after first coming into contact with the surface of the top precursor (figure 2.28 step (c)). Friction heat is generated between the precursors and the rotating tool during friction welding. A plastic flow due to the softening of the precursors leads to the filling of the gap between the tool and the steel tube. There are three thermocouples placed at upper, middle and lower positions which allow to measure the temperature during this friction welding process. At the end, the precursors are completely welded to the steel tube (figure 2.28 step (d)). The last step is the foam formation step that consists on heating the precursors welded to the steel into\na preheated furnace at temperatures above the melting temperature of the precursor material during a certain time, resulting in foam-filled part.\n5 mm\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 2.30: ADC12-foam-filled steel (A1050) tube fabricated by FSW technique with foaming times of (a) 8.5 min and (b) 11 min; (c) enlargement of part (b).\nDespite the Al foam-filled steel tubes being successfully fabricated by this process (Figure 2.30), it is very expensive and is non-competitive when compared to the conventional PM method to fabricate Al-alloy foams described in section 2.1.1. The PM method allows for the fabrication of foam filled tubes by heating the same foamable precursor material into the tubes in which the tube is filled by the foam during its formation (Figure 2.29(a)), without the need of previously bonding the precursor to the inner wall of the tube. It is also possible to fabricate aluminium tubes instead of the steel tubes filled with aluminium alloy foams leading to much lighter structures to mainly use in the automotive industry.\n2.3.2\tDeformation modes\nThe axial compressive crush performance of the individual components (tubes and foams) and FFTs, including the energy absorption capabilities have been studied and evaluated using uniaxial compression and bending tests, exploring their deformation and failure mechanisms. Also, numerical studies have been performed to develop mathematical models to help predict and describe the folding behaviour and stress-strain curves as well. The results have clearly demonstrated that the deformation mode and response of the FFTs seem to be a combination of the responses of the individual components (foams and empty tubes). Moreover, their response is also affected by the interaction between the foam filler and the wall of the tube.\nIn general, the crushing stresses of the FFTs exceed the sum of the individual responses of the foam filler and the tube. The load transfer from the tube to the foam filler results to higher stress values (stiffness). The foam filling leads to an improved compressive response due to the interaction between the tube wall and foam filler. The results have also demonstrated that a good interface bonding between the foam core and the tube is a pre-requisite for better mechanical response of the composite structure, leading to an effective in increasing energy absorption of the filled tubes. The foam filling contributes to better crush performance and can effectively resist the combination of compressive and bending forces. A strong bonding can contribute to improvement of the energy absorption capacity by two mechanisms: (i) increased load transfer from the tube wall to the foam core and (ii) the tearing of the bonded interface [32].\nThe deformation manner of the FFTs is very identical to that of the empty tubes. Thus, the deformation modes for cylindrical FFTs are axisymmetric (concertina mode), non-axisymmetric (diamond mode) or mixed mode pattern, or even global bending, while the deformation modes for square FFTs are symmetric collapse mode, asymmetric mixed collapse mode and extensional collapse mode, described in detail above.\nNonetheless, some researchers reported that the presence of foam filler can change the deformation mode of empty tubes. For example, Hanssen in 2000 [49] reported that the deformation mode cylindrical tubes changes from diamond to the concertina mode due to the foam density due to the interaction between the foam filler and the tube.\nThe deformation mode of FFTs, including the efficiency, stability and deformation reliability depends on the characteristics (e.g. microstructure and hardness) and geometric parameters of the thin-walled tube (e.g. D/t and L/t ratios for cylindrical tubes and C/L and C/t for square tubes), the properties of the foam filler and the interface bonding between the foam core and the inner wall tube. The results have confirmed that foam filler stabilizes the deformation of the thin-walled tubes and leads to an increase of the total absorbed crush energy [10,32,49,56]. Such structures absorb more energy than the empty tubes due to the interaction between the tube and the foam core which is related to the inter-facial phenomena discussed above [59].\nAlso, the use of a strong bonding between the filler and the tube wall was found to be effective in increasing energy absorption of the filled tubes. The foam filling contributes to better crush performance and can effectively resist the combination of compressive and bending forces. The number of lobes/folds increases and the fold length diminishes [49,59]. Figure 2.31 shows deformed specimens of ex-situ FFT (figure 2.31(a)) and in-situ FFT (figure 2.31(b)) prepared by PM method in which the ex-situ and insitu FFTs have a narrower gap and a good interface metallic bonding between the foam\ncore and the inner wall tube, respectively.\n(a)\t(b)\nFigure 2.31: (a) Deformed specimens of ex-situ FFT [10], (b) in-situ FFTs [32].\nIt has been reported an improved compressive and bending performance of the in-situ FFTs with a more stable and predictable mechanical performance under compressive [32] and bending loads [56], in which a strong metallic bonding between the foam core and the inner tube wall is formed. The narrower gap and partial mechanical interlocking between the foam core and the inner tube wall act more efficiently in terms of load transfer from the tube to the foam core, leading to an increase in the energy absorption capability. It has also been concluded that the effect of the lateral constrained deformation of the foam in FFTs is the main mechanism for ensuring a good crashworthiness. The air gap between the foam filler and the tube (figure 2.26(c)) might slightly contribute to inefficient and uncontrolled energy absorption.\nSimilarly to the empty tubes, the FFTs can start to deform in the middle or in one of the ends (lower or upper end), according to the quality of the properties of the outer tube [32]. For example, the ex-situ FFTs that use untreated tubes deform in the same manner as the simple untreated tubes (one of its individual components). Both start to deform in one of the ends (lower or upper end) developing folds (figure 2.18(b)) [10,48,49]. Visible cracks are developed, within these structures, mainly aligned with the loading direction already at the early loading stages and propagated during entire compressive process in the exterior tube of the FFTs as observed for the empty untreated tubes (figure 2.18(a)). However, the effect of the formation and propagation of these cracks is less pronounced with the presence of the foam filler [49,59]. Also, after the compression tests, the deformed ex-situ FFTs (figure 2.31(a)) show a similar distortion and irregular fold as observed for the empty untreated tubes (figure 2.18(a)) [32]. These ex-FFTs deform by axisymmetric concertina crushing mode with the formation of a single visible concertina fold in which there is a tendency of the foam also filling the concertina fold.\nIn opposite to the ex-situ FFTs and untreated, no visible cracks are observed for the in-situ FFTs (figure 2.31(b)) and treated tubes (figure 2.18(b)). It folds without the formation of the cracks. However, in opposite to the treated tubes, the in-situ FFTs do not show any distortion/irregularity. This deformation preference is obviously attributed to the interaction effect between the tube and the foam, which also provides a resistance to the inwards deformation of tube\u2019s wall. Hence, it causes an outwards expansion of the tube wall due to progressive buckling.\nThe developed in-situ FFTs offer a further benefit in terms of deformation, resulting in a very stable progressive crush behaviour and predictable failure [32]. This efficient bonding acts more efficiently in terms of load transfer from the tube to the foam core and is responsible for more predictable and stable behaviour observed in the in-situ FFTs. The resistance of the foam core to the inward and outward folding of the tube and the inter-facial friction between the foam core and the tube\u2019s inner wall are the two interaction effects. The constrained lateral movement of the foam within the tube improves the crush performance of the foam-filled structures. Also, the Al-alloys should be heat treated to avoid stress concentrations that might be severe enough to initiate cracking during the folding deformation. However, the structural changes of the tubes induced during the heat treatment can decrease their stiffness, which is also reflected in their energy absorption capacity [32].\nThe efficiency of foam filling depends besides on the geometry and the base material of the structure and its metallurgical and mechanical properties also on the foam filler density [49]. The results have demonstrated that the thin-walled tubes filled with highest density foam are the most efficient in terms of the peak stress and energy absorption [10, 32, 49, 59]. As for the simple Al-alloy foams, there is a tendency of the FFTs to start to densify earlier in terms of increasing the foam density. Also, the energy absorption increases with the increase of the foam filler density for FFTs, as well as for the metal foams. There is a critical foam density above which the foam filling effect is more prominent than the thickness of the tube\u2019s wall and the effect of the adhesive bonding. After a critical foam filler density, the filler has found to act as a solid material and resulted in an inefficient collapse mode. The researchers have shown that filling a thinwalled tube with a metal foam allows to save weight by decreasing the thickness of the wall of the tube in terms of the energy absorption capacity.\nSumming up, a key requirement is that the applied material exhibits a high energy absorption capacity and deforms well under crush loads, i.e. it is important that it folds without the formation of the cracks and does not tend to a fragment during compression, as it is the case of the in-situ FFTs (figure 2.31(b)). The strain rate sensitivity of FFTs is also noted, since the peak stress increases by increasing the loading rate. Moreover, the energy absorbing structures are required to collapse in a predictable manner with a controlled force level if they are to be used in real applications.\nFigure 2.32: Representation of folding mechanisms initiation [49].\n2.3.3\tApplications\nFoam filled tubes are used in automotive industry as filler of the hollow structures. Figure 2.33 shows two real applications of such structures. Figure 2.33(a) shows a crush absorber (safety separation net) made of aluminium foam which is used between back seat and the trunk in Audi Q7. Figure 2.33(b) shows a reinforcement for the frame rail for Ferrari Spider 430. Researchers believe that the incorporation of such structures into the automotive structures can further reduce the vehicle weight, increase the active safety in case of an accident and increase the passive safety by reducing the noise and vibrations while driving.\n(a)\t(b)\nFigure 2.33: Application of foam fillers: (a) foamed part for Ferrari 360 adn 430 spider [60] and (b) crash absorbing part for Audi Q7 [61].\nChapter 3\nMaterials and experimental methods\n3.1\tMaterials\nThe aim of this study is to study the effect of different foam fillers on the static and dynamic axial crush performance of the FFTs. The axial crush performance of FFTs were compared with the performance of the individual components (foam core and empty tubes). Thus, the materials used in this work were:\n\u2022\tSquare thin-walled tubes were produced of Al-alloy AA 6060 T66 (outer width of 25 mm, wall-thickness of 1.5 mm, length of 25 mm).\n\u2022\tOpen-cell foams, a plate of AlSi7Mg0.3 foams (300x150x50 mm3) with pore sizes of 10 ppi (pores per inch) was prepared by investment casting method. As for closed-cells, a block of AlSi7 foam (80x50x50 mm3) was prepared by powder metallurgy.\n\u2022\tAs for the polymer fillers, silicone polymer rubber (tekasil-2K-Z010) supplied by TKK d.o.o. (Slovenia) which consists of three components: component A (80 wt.%; (p = 1260 kg/m3, v = 25-30 Pa.s), component B (4 wt.%; catalyst) and component C (16 wt.%; silicone oil). First the components A and B are thoroughly mixed, then the component B is stirred into the mixture.\n\u2022\tEpoxy resin (p = 1100 kg/m3, Compression strength: 90.4 MPa) with a trade name Epoksi veza SN, supplied by KGK (Kemijsko-gradevinska industrija d.o.o., Karlovac, Croatia) which is composed by two component epoxy glue with 9:5 component ratio. The curing time is 25 minutes on 20\u00b0C.\n3.2\tPreparation of the specimens\nOpen-cell foam specimens (figure 3.1(a), 22x22x25 mm3) were cut from the big foam plate (350x150x50 mm3) to prepare of each type of structures (simple, silicone embedded open-cell, epoxy embedded open-cell foams and all ex-situ FFTs).\nThe simple open-cell foams embedded with a polymer (silicone and epoxy) were previously put into an auxiliary tube in which the inner surface of quadrilateral tube was greased to be able to push out the resulting core. The specimens of open-cell foams embedded with silicone (figure 3.1(b) ) were prepared by injecting the liquid silicone mixture under vacuum (0.5 MPa). The liquid mixture was further stirred in a vacuum chamber in order to avoid any residual air gaps after the filling of the foam with the silicon rubber. When the pressure in the vacuum chamber reached approximately 0 Pa, the open-cell foam specimens were filled and embedded with the silicon rubber and left for two days to let the silicone rubber completely cure. After this curing process, the superfluous silicone rubber was cut off along the outer planes of specimens.\nThe specimens of open-cell foams embedded with epoxy (figure 3.1(c) ) were prepared by pouring the epoxy resin into foam that was previously placed into quadrilateral tube. Afterwards free surface was machined by milling in lathe machine. Specimens have been tested after 2 days of curing on room temperature.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 3.1: (a) Open-cell foams; specimens with polymer filler: (b) silicone and (c) epoxy\nThe ex-situ FFTs filled with open-cell foams were prepared by simply inserting an open-cell foam into the empty tube (figure 3.2(a) ). The ex-situ FFTs filled with simple open-cell foams embedded with silicone (figure 3.2(b) ) or epoxy (figure 3.2(c)) were prepared by firstly inserting the open-cell foam into a tube, followed the incorporation of the silicone or epoxy within the foam, using the experimental procedures described above. Closed-cell foam specimens (22x22x25 mm3) were cut from the block foam (80x50x50 mm3) to prepare of simple (figure 3.3(a) ) and ex-situ FFTs specimens (figure 3.3(b) ). The ex-situ FFTs (figure 3.3(b)) were prepared by directly inserting a closed-cell foam into the empty tube. The block foam (80x50x50 mm3) was fabricated by heating a precursor material into a placed into a pre-heated furnace at 700\u00b0C.\nIn-situ foam-filled tubes made of aluminium alloys (figure 3.3(c) ) prepared by powder metallurgy which is used the manufacturing process described in detail in [Duarte et al., Materials and Design, 2015]. Basically, the in-situ FFTs were fabricated by filling the tube by a foam during the foam formation step. The empty tube containing precursor was placed into a pre-heated furnace at 700\u00b0C.\n(a)\nFigure 3.2: FFTs with:\n(c)\n(b)\n(a) open-cell foams, (b) silicone filler and (c) epoxy filer.\n(a)\t(b)\t(c)\nFigure 3.3: Specimens of: (a) Closed-cell foam, (b) ex-situ FFTs and (c) in-situ FFTs .\n\n3.3\tUniaxial compressive testing\nThe specimens, except the specimens based on epoxy (cores and tubes filled with epoxy embedded open-cell foam) were submitted to uni-axial compression tests under quasistatic and dynamic loading conditions using a servo-hydraulic dynamic INSTRON 8801 testing machine with a load cell 50 kN (figure 3.4(b)), in which the cross-head rates were 0.1 mm/s and 284 mm/s, respectively. The specimens based on epoxy were tested using an electro-mechanical RAAGEN testing machine with maximum load 250 kN (figure 3.4(a)). The specimens under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions were monitored by a conventional video camera and by a high cooled middle-wave infrared (IR) thermal camera Flir SC 5000 (figure 3.4(a)), respectively. The mechanical response analysis of the different structures studied in this work was performed according to the standard ISO 13314: 2011 [62]. The load-displacement data were transformed to engineering stress-strain data based on the specimen dimensions. The plateau stress, the yield stress, densification strain are calculated following the standard ISO 13314: 2011 [62]. The absorbed energy per unit volume (strain energy density) for each type of the structure was calculated by integrating the stress-strain curves using the Origin Pro (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Specific absorption energy curve for each type of the structure was determined by dividing the absorbed energy per unit volume by the total weight of the specimen.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 3.4: (a) Servo-hydraulic dynamic INSTRON 8801 testing machine and (b) electromechanical RAAGEN testing machine and IR camera Flir SC 5000.\n3.4\tInfrared thermography\nThe deformation and failure modes under quasi-static loading were captured using a standard video camera, while they were additionally recorded by the high speed cooled middle-wave infrared (IR) thermal camera Flir SC 5000 in case of the dynamic loading conditions. The Infrared(IR) thermography is based on cooled InSb middle wave detectors, enabling to acquire at high frame rates, achieving frame rate up to 700 Hz, as in the camera model used, Flic SC 5000. It has been demonstrated that this IR thermography is an efficient tool for evaluating high speed deformation rates to detect the plastification zones and collapse mechanism under dynamic loading conditions of structures based on cellular metals, such as open-cell foams [44], closed-cell foams [10], syntactic foams [63], Advanced Pore morphology (APM) spherical foams or even into these cellular metals into the tubes (foam filled tubes) [56].\nThis is not a method of strain measurement but a method to evaluate material yielding process [64]. However, in the case of metallic foams, this method is limited to dynamic tests, since in the quasi-static tests, the heat dissipation is too fast to be measured due to material's high heat conductivity. The specimens tested under dynamic tests were painted with black paint. The yielding process is clearly observed using this technique under the applied dynamical loading. IR thermography allows to trace the propagation of plastification front waves, plastification slide lines and cracks. According to producer's specifications, accuracy of this machine is \u00b11% which is equivalent to \u00b11\u00b0C [45,64,65].\nAs for open-cell foams, IR thermography allows to detect deformation modes as well as the plastification front propagation and the inner structure heat. Open-cell foams can be embedded with filler materials (e.g. epoxy and silicone) in order to increase energy absorption capacity. Applied to this cases, it is able to evaluate plastification of the filler material and effects of incompressibility in deformation modes. Previous works noticed change from layer-wise mechanisms in no filler specimens to tangential stress slide-lines in filled ones [45, 64, 65]. As for closed-cell foams, IR thermography allows to obtain distribution of surface strain, formation of slide zones and fractures [65].\n3.5\tExperimental methodology\nWithin this study ten types of materials/structures made of aluminium alloy were analysed and compared: open-cell foams, silicone embedded open-cell foams, epoxy embedded open-cell foams, closed-cell foams, thin-walled tubes, tubes filled with open-cell foams, tubes filled with silicone embedded open-cell foams, tubes filled with epoxy embedded open-cell foams, ex-situ closed-cell foam filled tubes and in-situ closed-cell foam filled tubes.\nTables 3.1 to 3.3 give an overview of these specimens, summarising their main geometrical dimensions and the number of performed test for mechanical characterisation.\nTiago Rodrigues\tMaster Degree\nTable 3.1: Overview of the core specimens (geometrical dimensions) for performed mechanical tests.\nSpecimen Weight\tDimensions\tVolume Density\n\t\t[g]\tLI [mm]\tLength L2 [mm]\tL [mm]\tWidth [mm]\tHeight [mm]\t[cm3]\t[g/cm3]\n\tOF-l\t1.127\t24.75\t24.65\t24.70\t21.85\t21.90\t11.82\t0.095\n\tOF-2\t1.108\t24.75\t24.40\t24.58\t21.65\t21.95\t11.68\t0.095\nOpen-cell\tOF-3\t1.105\t24.25\t24.30\t24.28\t22.20\t22.15\t11.94\t0.093\ncore\tOF-4\t1.056\t25.15\t25.20\t25.18\t20.85\t21.95\t11.52\t0.0917\n\tOF-5\t1.061\t23.90\t24.35\t24.13\t21.95\t21.90\t11.60\t0.092\n\tOF-6\t1.140\t24.40\t24.30\t24.35\t21.70\t21.65\t11.44\t0.100\nOpen-cell\tEF-1\t1.110\t24.10\t24.05\t24.08\t22.22\t22.35\t11.96\t1.200\ncore with\tEF-2\t1.090\t24.45\t24.20\t24.33\t21.70\t20.95\t11.06\t1.290\nepoxy filler\tEF-3\t1.177\t24.20\t23.80\t24.00\t21.90\t21.80\t11.46\t1.250\n\tSF-1\t1.054\t24.41\t24.36\t24.39\t21.66\t21.36\t11.28\t1.320\n\tSF-2\t1.178\t24.27\t23.81\t24.04\t21.42\t21.97\t11.31\t1.310\nOpen-cell\tSF-3\t1.033\t24.39\t23.96\t24.18\t21.71\t21.04\t11.04\t1.340\ncore with\tSF-4\t1.049\t24.47\t24.25\t24.36\t21.82\t21.73\t11.55\t1.280\nsilicone filler\tSF-5\t1.068\t23.90\t24.45\t24.18\t21.87\t21.68\t11.46\t1.250\n\tSF-6\t1.112\t22.77\t23.97\t23.37\t20.83\t21.86\t10.64\t1.360\n\tCF-1\t2.380\t25.91\t25.80\t25.86\t21.31\t21.74\t11.98\t0.20\n\tCF-2\t3.204\t24.72\t24.50\t24.61\t21.31\t21.49\t11.27\t0.28\n\tCF-3\t3.402\t25.63\t25.57\t25.60\t21.71\t21.29\t11.83\t0.29\nClosed-cell\tCF-4\t4.886\t25.25\t25.38\t25.32\t21.65\t21.41\t11.73\t0.42\ncore\tCF-5\t5.022\t25.17\t24.77\t24.97\t21.83\t21.56\t11.75\t0.43\n\tCF-6\t5.631\t24.72\t24.85\t24.79\t21.60\t21.62\t11.57\t0.49\n\tCF-7\t6.018\t24.95\t24.75\t24.85\t21.58\t21.42\t11.49\t0.52\n\tCF-8\t6.192\t24.82\t24.92\t24.87\t21.85\t21.57\t11.72\t0.53\n3.Materials and experimental methods\nTiago Rodrigues\tMaster Degree\nTable 3.2: Overview of the foam filled tubes based on open-cell specimens (geometrical dimensions) for performed mechanical tests.\nSpecimen\tWeight\tDimensions\tVolume\n\t\tFoam [g]\tTube ;

This is mainly due to their brittle behaviour, with collapse and fracture of cell walls. This behaviour also influences plateau region, with ups and downs on the stress-strain curve. Analysing table 4.1, it is possible to observe the increase of Young\u2019s modulus from quasistatic to dynamic tests, due to higher curves presented by the latter, and elastic regime at lower strains.\nTable 4.1: Young\u2019s modulus of open-cell foams.\t\t\t\nSpecimen\tDensity [kg/m3]\tYoung Modulus [MPa]\tError\nOF-1\t0.095\t7.295\t0.9904\nOF-2\t0.095\t9.655\t0.9926\nOF-3\t0.093\t10.109\t0.9907\nOF-4\t0.092\t155.937\t0.9925\nOF-5\t0.092\t150.160\t0.9947\nOF-6\t0.100\t126.960\t0.9945\nSimilarly to closed-cells, there is a relation between density and mechanical properties, but in this case, due to small density gradients, the influence is not so relevant. Through visualisation of figure 4.1(b), in quasi-static loading is observed the formation on only one deformation band and consequent collapse. There is no relevant transversal deformation, corresponding to a low Poisson\u2019s ratio, characteristic of porous materials. As for dynamic loading, represented in figure 4.1(c), one main deformations bands is observed. The foam ends up collapsing through this layer, in the direction of the loading force.\nThrough analysis of figure 4.1(a) and tables 4.1 and 4.5 is evident the difference in Young\u2019s modulus in quasi-static and in dynamic loading, and the latter is about ten higher. Besides that, there are no relevant differences in peak, plateau or densification\nstress, as well as in corresponding deformation strains. These specimens reveal a strainrate sensitivity, with higher peak stresses in dynamic conditions.\nStrain [-]\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.1: (a) Open-cell foams core stress-strain curves, and progressive deformation: (b) quasi-static , and (c) dynamic.\n4.1.2\tSilicone embedded open-cell foams\nDue to their structure, open-cell foams can be used with fillers. These are normally viscous fillers, such as silicone. Once they\u2019re viscous, they offer flow resistance during foam compression. This compression ends up increasing the structure stiffness [45]. Analysing table4.2, it is possible to observe the low and sometimes irregular Young\u2019s\nmodulus, as in specimen SF-4 and SF-6, corresponding to a low elastic deformation. This is probably due to the slip of the silicone during compression.\nTable 4.2: Young\u2019s modulus of open cell foams embedded with silicone.\nSpecimen Density Young Modulus Error - r2\n[kg/m3]\t[MPa]\nSF-1\t1,320\t6.072\t0.9879\nSF-2\t1,310\t7.603\t0.9923\nSF-3\t1,340\t7.014\t0.9894\nSF-4\t1,280\t1.785\t0.9909\nSF-5\t1,250\t7.9608\t0.9865\nSF-6\t1,360\t3.8114\t0.9959\nVesenjak (2008) et al. concluded through computer simulation that cellular structures mechanical behaviour is influenced by the presence of a viscous filler, increasing energy absorption capability. It was also concluded that structures with higher relative density are more influenced by the filler due to an increment of flow resistance [45]. Later, Vesejak (2009, 2013) et al. studied, experimentally, the behaviour of regular (Vesenjak et al. [45]) and irregular (Vesenjak et al. [44]) open-cell cellular structures. The conclusion was that in spite of both specimens present typical porous material behaviour, the latter shows a more smooth behaviour, opposite to the brittle behaviour of the regular ones.\nOpen-cell foam with silicone filler exhibits a compressive behaviour typical of porous materials, as expected. Analysing figure 4.2(a) is possible to observe a small elastic step, followed by a slightly increasing plateau region and consequently the final densification of the structure. Silicone filler stabilizes Plateaus region, in contrast to the brittle responde of open-cells by themselves without any filler, but the curve it is not much horizontal, with an incrreasing slope. This is in agreement with previous works Vesenjak et al. [44]. Silicone filler also increases the specimen energy absorption, with higher values of plateau\u2019s stress - around 2.5 higher values, whether quasi-static or dynamic test - as well as in higher initial specimen yielding.\nAs for to densification, it happens at 2.5 higher stress values comparatively to opencells. However, the strain is 1.30 times smaller due to the existence of the filler. Nevertheless, silicone fillers improve the energy absorption capacity. Regardless of this, the total mass of the specimen increases and the specific energy absorption capacity is smaller than open-cells by themselves. This is due to mass increase, caused by the silicone, with values of approximately 1.93 times higher.\nIt is also possible to observe a strain-rate sensitivity, with higher peak stresses in dynamic conditions, similarly to open-cell foams.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.2: (a) Open-cell foams embedded with silicone stress-strain curves , and progressive deformation: (b) quasi-static, and (c) dynamic.\n4.1.3\tEpoxy embedded open-cell foams\nFilling open-cell foams with epoxy confers different properties to the specimen than with silicone. This is due to the characteristic stiffness of the epoxy. However, it also presents a brittle behaviour. Analysing table 4.3, it is possible to observe higher Young\u2019s modulus than the ones of other cores.\nTable 4.3: Young\u2019s modulus of open cell foams embedded with epoxy.\nSpecimen Density Young Modulus Error - r2\n[kg/m3]\t[MPa]\nEF-1\t1.200\t2043.536\t0.9950\nEF-2\t1.290\t2038.674\t0.9916\nEF-3\t1.250\t2031.784\t0.9933\nDue to the high stiffness and the fact that another machine would be required for the operation, epoxy was only tested in quasi-static conditions. Through figure 4.3(b) it is possible to observe the expansion at the sides of the specimen at the same time it is being compressed, ending up fracturing into small parts.\nAnalysing figure 4.3(a), there are several differences between the behaviour of foams without fillers and foams with silicone compared with foams filled with epoxy. These present more stable curves, with an elastic stage going to higher values than the others. However, after this, there is a decrease and several peaks until densification happen.\nBesides the brittle behaviour, higher values of peak stress and densification stress are obtained while densification occurs at 1.12 higher strain than for open-cell foams without any filler. It is also observable a small influence of density, but due to the small range of the specimen\u2019s densities, the influence it is not very conclusive. However, higher performances were obtained by the specimen with higher density. These results are presented in table 4.5.These specimens can\u2019t be analysed in terms of strain rate sensitivity, since only quasi-static conditions were tested.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.3: (a) Open-cell foams embedded with epoxy stress-strain curves, and (b) progressive quasi-static deformation .\n4.2\tCompressive behaviour of the cellular foams based on closed-cell foams\nFrom table 4.4 is possible to observe an increased stiffness corresponding to higher densities. Furthermore, it is possible to observe the influence of the surface skin, with specimen CF-1 (doesn\u2019t present surface skin) showing the lowest Young\u2019s modulus.\nTable 4.4: Young\u2019s modulus of closed-cell foams.\nSpecimen Density Young Modulus Error - r2\n[kg/m3]\t[MPa]\nCF-1\t0.200\t19.899\t0.9904\nCF-2\t0.280\t133.264\t0.9927\nCF-3\t0.290\t130.834\t0.9918\nCF-4\t0.420\t136.866\t0.9940\nCF-5\t0.430\t162.769\t0.9967\nCF-6\t0.490\t174.762\t0.9850\nCF-7\t0.520\t168.283\t0.9987\nCF-8\t0.530\t249.445\t0.9905\nRelatively to quasi-static deformation, it is possible to observe in figure 4.4(b) the formation of three deformation bands, perpendicular to loading direction. These occur in weaker regions of the foam. It is also possible to observe that exist gradient of densities inside of the specimen, caused by a non-uniform foam growth. It is visible that the cells outside the deformation band keep almost their original shape, even though they deform elastically. The propagation of the deformation bands is uniform and in the direction of the force.\nAs for to dynamic analysis, is possible to observe a single deformation band. Observed deformation is not perpendicular to the direction of the force, probably due to gradient of densities. However, from a certain point, the deformation turns perpendicular to the direction of the force.\nIn the plot of figure 4.4(a) one of the most evident characteristics if the fact that the main mechanical properties increase with foam density increasing, as also reported in [19,20,66]. From the plot is also visible an increase of compressive strength in dynamic conditions, relatively to quasi-static ones which is in accordance with some previous works, but another authors verified that this depends of specimen\u2019s densities, with higher strain rates corresponding to higher densities [67]. Yet, another authors concluded that the foams are insensitive to strain rate, but these specimens where made through different production methods [68].\nSome specimens exhibit a surface skin in some faces, due to production method (the precursor material is foamed, then it is sliced into specimens with the desired shape and size). This results in an increase of the foam strength as well as in oscillations in plateau stress, due to skin\u2019s disintegration. The same way, CF-1 (0.20 g/cm3) presents lower mechanical properties. For example, peak stress value it is only of 0.56 MPa, while for specimen CF-1 with density 0.28 g/cm3 the peak stress value is of 3.30 MPa, almost 6 times higher.\nThe plateau regime, representing the continuous collapse of cell walls and edges, is described by some oscillations, due to the presence of the surface skin. This surface\ncauses oscillations due to its continuous partial disintegration. Lastly, densification occurs, ending up in total collapse of the porous structure. These tests revealed a similar behaviour with open-cell foams relatively to strain rate sensitivity, with higher mechanical responses in dynamic conditions.\n(b)\nFigure 4.4: (a) Closed-cell foams stress-strain curves, (b) progressive deformation: quasistatic , and (c) dynamic.\nFrom tables 4.4 and 4.5 is possible to conclude the interference of the surface skin. Specimen CF-1, represented in the plot of figure 4.4(a) by the black squares, exhibits a mechanical behaviour far weaker than its pairs. This happens due to the absence of skin (figure 4.5(a)), in contrast to the increased mechanical properties of specimen CF-2, represented by black circles in figure 4.4(a) and completely deformed in figure 4.5(b).\n(a)\t(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.5: Closed-cell foam core: (a)with skin, (b) without skin and (c) the final deformed foam.\n4.3\tConcluding remarks\nObserving figure 4.6(a) it is possible to observe the better response of the open-cell foams embedded with epoxy. In figure 4.6(b) is in detail the behaviour of the different cores except the ones with epoxy, due to its higher curves. It is also possible to observe the strain rate sensitivity of the specimens. Dynamic curves exhibit higher peak stresses than the black ones to all the specimens.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.6: Average of the stress-strain curves: (a) with epoxy specimen and (b) without epoxy specimen.\nTiago Rodrigues\tMaster Degree\nTable 4.5: Properties of the core specimens.\nSpecimen Density Velocity\nElastic region\nPlateau region\nDensification region\n\t[g/cm3]\t[mm/s]\t[MPa]\te\ta\tCp=0.2\t<7e=0.4\t<7pZ\t^-dens\t1.3<7y\u00bf\n\t0.095\t1\t7.30\t0.035\t0.138\t0.289\t0.261\t0.275\t0.583\t0.357\n\t0.095\t1\t10.11\t0.039\t0.231\t0.252\t0.239\t0.246\t0.559\t0.319\nOpen-cell\t0.093\t1\t9.65\t0.050\t0.258\t0.260\t0.256\t0.258\t0.542\t0.336\ncore\t0.092\t284\t155.94\t0.028\t0.228\t0.273\t0.278\t0.275\t0.522\t0.358\n\t0.092\t284\t150.16\t0.033\t0.232\t0.250\t0.343\t0.297\t0.554\t0.386\n\t0.100\t284\t126.96\t0.025\t0.333\t0.294\t0.274\t0.284\t0.543\t0.369\nOpen-cell\t1.200\t1\t2098.55\t0.654\t77.815\t65.751\t52.246\t\t0.566\t49.320\ncore with\t1.290\t1\t1962.09\t0.053\t76.344\t51.728\t68.231\t-\t0.638\t76.686\nepoxy filler\t1.250\t1\t1994.81\t0.052\t75.793\t51.444\t69.666\t\t0.627\t74.275\n\t1.320\t1\t6.0721\t0.082\t0.420\t0.542\t0.718\t0.630\t0.405\t0.819\n\t1.310\t1\t7.6026\t0.076\t0.451\t0.561\t0.821\t0.691\t0.432\t0.898\nOpen-cell\t1.340\t1\t7.0140\t0.063\t0.398\t0.542\t0.773\t0.657\t0.441\t0.855\ncore with\t1.280\t284\t-\t0.073\t0.308\t0.517\t0.879\t0.698\t0.413\t0.907\nsilicone filler\t1.250\t284\t-\t0.037\t0.299\t0.566\t0.915\t0.740\t0.420\t0.963\n\t1.360\t284\t-\t-\t\t0.579\t0.858\t0.718\t0.436\t0.934\n\t0.200\t1\t19.90\t0.032\t0.564\t0.659\t1.157\t0.908\t0.403\t1.180\n\t0.280\t1\t135.77\t0.038\t3.301\t3.321\t4.043\t3.682\t0.476\t4.786\n\t0.290\t1\t119.90\t0.034\t3.412\t3.105\t3.506\t3.306\t0.527\t4.297\nclosed-cell\t0.420\t1\t136.87\t0.054\t4.040\t5.303\t7.775\t6.539\t0.430\t8.501\ncore\t0.430\t284\t162.35\t0.042\t3.880\t5.141\t7.274\t6.208\t0.442\t8.070\n\t0.490\t284\t174.76\t0.053\t4.689\t5.126\t6.284\t5.705\t0.503\t7.417\n\t0.520\t284\t168.28\t0.063\t7.315\t7.977\t11.873\t9.925\t0.431\t12.903\n\t0.530\t284\t249.45\t0.060\t7.955\t9.415\t11.956\t10.686\t0.475\t13.891\n4.Results and Discussion\n4.4\tCompressive behaviour of the thin-walled tubes\nThin walled tubes were subjected either to quasi-static and dynamic compression tests and the results are presented in table 4.7. Values of Young\u2019s modulus are represented in table 4.6.\nTable 4.6: Young\u2019s modulus of thin-walled tubes.\nSpecimen Density Young Modulus Error - r2\n\t[kg/m3]\t[MPa]\t\nT25-1\t\t2494.732\t0.9933\nT25-2\t\t3352.772\t0.9913\nT25-3\t\t3424.868\t0.9900\nT25-4\t\t2441.660\t0.9977\nT25-5\t\t2216.990\t0.9933\nT25-6\t\t2269.688\t0.9954\nDuring the quasi-static tests (figure 4.7(b)), the buckles began to form in the middle of the thin-walled tubes, instead of one of the ends as observed in previous studies of Fyllingen et. al [37]. It was verified that the predominant deformation mode was asymmetric mode B , which has two adjacent layers deforming outwards and the other two deforming inwards. In this test it wasn\u2019t detected any fracture of crack in any of the specimens.\nRelatively to dynamic tests (figure 4.7(c)), buckles also began to form in the middle of the thin-walled tube. However, in terms of deformation modes, there is a slight difference relatively to quasi-static tests. While the specimens T25-4 and T25-5 deformed extensionally, the T25-6 specimen deformed symmetrically. Analysing this information together with data from table 4.7 and figure 4.7(a), it is possible to conclude that symmetric mode of deformation allows a smoother densification than extensional mode, which is abrupt.\nTable 4.7: Results from the thin-walled tubes compression tests.\nSpecimen Velocity\tElastic region\tMinimum\tDensification\nregion\n\t[mm/s]\t[MPa]\te\ta\te\ta\tedens\tadens\nT25 - 1\t1\t2364,90\t0,049\t38,226\t0,411\t19,657\t0,540\t19,238\nT25 - 2\t1\t3352,77\t0,048\t37,530\t0,035\t18,937\t0,619\t16,047\nT25 - 3\t1\t3424,87\t0,049\t37,414\t0,288\t21,325\t0,637\t14,759\nT25 - 4\t284\t1934,23\t0,049\t39,125\t0,360\t20,078\t0,633\t18,104\nT25 - 5\t284\t2216,99\t0,059\t39,751\t0,398\t19,846\t0,559\t18,641\nT25 - 6\t284\t2269,69\t0,047\t38,197\t0,415\t17,733\t0,622\t16,458\nThin-walled tubes are characterized by five main regions (A, B, C, D and E), represented in figure 4.7(a), and the number of peaks, besides the initial one, corresponds to the number of buckles formed. The different specimens present similar behaviours with slightly more relevant differences in region C, D and E. In the case of sample T25-1 and T25-6, the corresponding strain to minimum stress is higher, and the specimens densifie smoother than the remaining. Besides this, peak stress in dynamic tests is little higher\nthan in quasi-static ones, in contrast to another authors such as Langseth et al. [59]. This means that the material used in the thin-walled tubes, aluminium, is strain rate sensitive.\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.7: (a) Thin-walled tubes stress-strain curves, and progressive deformation: (b) quasi-static , (c) dynamic.\n4.5\tCompressive behaviour of the foam filled tubes based on open-cell foams\n4.5.1\tTubes filled with open-cell foams\nThrough a first analysis of table 4.8 it is possible to observe a decrease of Young\u2019s modulus comparatively to the one of empty tubes.\nTable 4.8: Young\u2019s modulus of foam filled tubes with open-cell cores.\nSpecimen\tDensity\tYoung Modulus\tError - r\n\t[kg/m3]\t[MPa]\t\nFFTs_OF-1\t0,0996\t1896,191\t0,9909\nFFTs_OF-2\t0,1000\t2254,829\t0,9913\nFFTs_OF-3\t0,0900\t2335,700\t0,9950\nFFTs_OF-4\t0,0903\t1799,100\t0,9956\nFFTs_OF-5\t0,0893\t1467,421\t0,9977\nFFTs_OF-6\t0,0880\t1621,227\t0,9966\nAnalysing figure 4.8(b) is possible to observe quasi-static progressive buckling in quasi-static conditions. The observed deformation mode is symmetric. Joining the analysis of table 4.11 and figure 4.8(a), is possible to conclude a mix of behaviours, on one hand the stiffness from thin-walled tubes, and on the other hand, the open-cell foam filler. It is observable the characteristic curve, where the peaks correspond to the buckle formation. Levels of stress are higher than the ones observed to open-cell cores in the previous section. Comparatively to the empty tubes, the basic behaviour is quite similar, however an improvement in stress levels is acquired, due to increase of load transfer caused by the presence of the foam. Relatively to minimum stress, which corresponds to total collapse of the buckle, comparatively to empty tubes value rises 1.10 times in quasi-static compression and diminish 1.20 times in dynamic compression. As for densification stress, the values rise 1.07 and diminish 1.08 times in the same conditions.\nIt is also possible to observe a strain-rate sensitivity, with higher peak stresses in dynamic conditions.\nRelatively to dynamic analysis, through figure 4.8(c) is possible to observe that the deformation it is not symmetric in the left and in the right side of the tube. In the left side the deformation begins near the middle of the tube, while in the right side it begins a little above. However, all the tubes submitted to dynamic test ended up collapsing with two opposite lobes going inwards and the other two going outwards (figure 4.5.1).\nAs for density influence, it is possible to observe that higher foam densities also increase the mechanical properties of the foam filled tube. In this case the influence it is not so highlighted due to small density gradients.\n(a)\n(b)\nfr\tmm&lt;k\u00bb'\n(c)\nFigure 4.8: (a) Foam filled tubes with open-cell foams stress-strain curves, and progressive deformation: (b) quasi-static, (c) dynamic.\nFigure 4.9: Final dynamic deformation of FFTs with open-cell foam.\n4.5.2\tTubes filled with silicone embedded open-cell foams\nEmbedding open-cell foams with silicone and then inserting them into empty-tubes it is another possible configuration of filled tubes. These ended up decreasing the value of elastic Young's Modulus, comparatively to the thin-walled tubes. As for the cores, this is also due to the slip of the silicone, due to its smoother behaviour. It is visible the direct relation of the density of the specimen and the correspondent Young's modulus.\nTable 4.9: Young's modulus of foam filled tubes with open-cell cores embedded with silicone.\nSpecimen\tDensity\tYoung Modulus\tError -\n\t[kg/m3 ]\t[MPa]\t\nFFTs_SF-1\t1.28\t1308.827\t0,9940\nFFTs_SF-2\t1.30\t1489.851\t0,9932\nFFTs_SF-3\t1.26\t1122.575\t0,9620\nFFTs_SF-4\t1.31\t1512.525\t0,9889\nFFTs_SF-5\t1.33\t1686.543\t0,9922\nObserving figure 4.10(b) and figure 4.10(c) it is possible to observe different behaviours in quasi-static and dynamic compression tests, respectively. In both of them the buckle begins to form near one of the ends of the tube. Then, in quasi-static conditions, the compression continues, and an asymmetrical deformation mode is observed. Compression goes on, until the pressurized silicone begins to release itself from the tube, as happened in the tests of the embedded open-cell foams without the tube. These specimens present higher values of peak stress and densification, 1.12 and 1.99 times higher than FFTs with open-cell, however also present 1.68 lower densification strain.\nAs for dynamic tests, an extensional deformation mode is observed, also existing release of silicone. However, in dynamic conditions, rupture occurs. From figure 4.5.2 it is possible to observe that the specimens don't maintain their structure, occurring fracture of the tubes, due to the pressure made by the silicone. Peak and densification stress values in dynamic conditions are 1.42 and 1.60 times higher than FFTs with opencell, but similarly to quasi-static conditions, densification strain is 1.63 times lower.\nFrom figure 4.8(a) it is possible to observe a curve similar to the filled tubes, with a decrease of stress due to silicone flow. After this, the curve becomes unstable, with a lot of ups and downs until final densification. From table 4.11 it is possible to relate densification stress with specimen's density, with lower densities corresponding to higher densification stresses. Similarly to FFTs with open-cell foams, the specimens exhibit a strain-rate sensitivity, with higher peak stresses in dynamic conditions.\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.10: (a) Foam filled tubes with open-cell foams embedded with silicone stressstrain curves , and progressive deformation: (b) quasi-static, (c) dynamic.\nFigure 4.11: Final deformation of FFTs with open-cell foams embedded with silicone.\n4.5.3\tTubes filled with epoxy embedded open-cell foams\nAnalysing table 4.10, it is possible to observe very similar elastic response of Young\u2019s modulus to similar densities. However, further specimens with different densities should be analysed in order to better understand the behaviour of the epoxy as a filler material. Young\u2019s modulus values are smaller than the ones for the core without the tube. The only tests realized were quasi-static, due to the high stiffness of the epoxy, as referred also for the epoxy core.\nTable 4.10: Young\u2019s modulus of foam filled tubes with open-cell cores embedded with epoxy.\nSpecimen Density Young Modulus Error - r2\n[kg/m3 ]\t[MPa]\nEF-1\t1.23\t1442.550\t0.9982\nEF-2\t1.24\t1447.876\t0.9989\nExamining figure 4.12(a), it is possible to observe similar behaviour of FFTs filled with epoxy compared with the other tubes. It presents the characteristic linear stage, followed by the stress drop until the minimum, and subsequent increase and decrease of density until densification.\nAnalysing also table 4.11, it is possible to observe the similar behaviours in terms of peak minimum and densification stresses. These are higher values than the ones for other specimens. Relatively to densification strains, it is possible to observe that densification occurs at higher strains than any other specimen.\nIn the quasi-static test, figure 4.12(b), it was observed the formation of one buckle in the right side and two lobes in the left side. These ended up joining into only one larger lobe and it was observed rupture of the tube\u2019s wall primarily in this region. Consequently, epoxy was expelled through this gap. Peak stress was 2.63 higher than for thin-walled tubes, while densification stress 6.81 times higher.\nDifferent tubes presented different behaviours but all of them deformed extensionally,\npresenting rupture in one, two or even all the four corners (figure 4.5.3).\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.12: Foam filled tubes with open-cell foams embedded with epoxy stress-strain curves a), and progressive deformation b).\nFigure 4.13: Final deformation of FFTs with open-cell embedded with epoxy.\nTable 4.11: Foam filled tubes with open-cell foams and open-cell embedded with polymer fillers.\nDensif.\nSpecimen Velocity Density\tElastic region\tMinimum\tregion\n\t[mm/s]\t\t[MPa]\te\ta\te\ta\tedens\tadens\nOF-1\t1\t0,0996\t1896,19\t0,044\t35,67\t0,38\t17,29\t0,566\t17,16\nOF-2\t1\t0,1\t2254,83\t0,055\t37,83\t0,30\t21,26\t0,600\t17,12\nOF-3\t1\t0,09\t2335,70\t0,066\t39,43\t0,33\t21,81\t0,606\t18,60\nOF-4\t284\t0,0903\t1799,10\t0,058\t38,48\t0,38\t19,94\t0,590\t23,41\nOF-5\t284\t0,0893\t1467,42\t0,049\t36,59\t0,45\t16,26\t0,602\t16,35\nOF-6\t284\t0,088\t1621,23\t0,049\t37,87\t0,46\t16,56\t0,611\t16,79\nSF-1\t1\t1.28\t1308.827\t0.063\t38.06\t0.18\t30.79\t0.358\t34.23\nSF-2\t1\t1.3\t1489.851\t0.060\t37.48\t0.20\t30.84\t-\t-\nSF-3\t284\t1.26\t1122.575\t0.061\t40.99\t0.32\t34.67\t0.395\t19.26\nSF-4\t284\t1.31\t1512.525\t0.635\t39.58\t0.21\t32.13\t0.368\t34.90\nSF-5\t284\t\t1686.543\t0.070\t40.52\t0.23\t32.77\t0.315\t35,297\nEF-1\t1\t1.23\t1142.550\t0.091\t101.93\t0.21\t83.71\t0.639\t123.36\nEF-2\t1\t1.24\t1447.876\t0.089\t103.99\t0.19\t83.72\t0.647\t123.05\n4.6\tCompressive behaviour of foam filled tubes based on closed-cell foams\n4.6.1\tEx-situ closed-cell foam filled tubes\nLooking at figure 4.14(a) and analysing table 4.12 there is a highlighted characteristic. It has been referred in this work the influence of density in mechanical properties. In this particular case that effect is highlighted, with levels of curves to the correspondent densities.\nTable 4.12: Young\u2019s modulus of ex-situ foam filled tubes with closed-cell foams.\nSpecimen\t\tDensity [kg/m3]\tYoung Modulus [MPa]\tError -\nFFTs_\t_CF-1\t0,19\t1587,628\t0,9942\nFFTs_\tCF-2\t0,29\t2371,236\t0,9933\nFFTs_\tCF-3\t0,29\t2490,344\t0,9940\nFFTs_\tCF-4\t0,42\t3083,490\t0,9958\nFFTs_\tCF-5\t0,41\t2713,134\t0,9929\nFFTs_\tCF-6\t0,48\t1267,630\t0,9652\nFFTs_\tCF-7\t0,52\t2431,068\t0,9920\nFFTs_\tCF-8\t0,53\t1254,523\t0,9690\nQuasi-static compression (figure 4.14(b)), gives origin to symmetric deformation, which is in accord with previous works of Hanssen et al [49]. The presence of the filler increases the stiffness of the tube, stabilizing the stress-strain curves. With higher densities the usual curve of tube\u2019s compression suffers changes and the usual minimum stress correspondent to the buckle formation turns into a smoother curve, due to the effect of the filler, which absorbs part of the impact energy and improves the stiffness of the tube. In the current tests no rupture was recorded.\nAs for to dynamic tests (figure 4.14(c)), two main deformation modes were recorded. In specimen 5 there was extensional, while specimen 6 deformed asymmetrically. The deformation was not perpendicular to the direction of the load. Initially it looks like there is the formation of two different buckles, one on the middle of the tube and other a little above. However, they converge into one, which is not perpendicular to the direction of the load, deforming quicker in the left side of the tube.\nThe results, presented in table 4.14, show an improvement of the general of the mechanical properties of the empty-tube by itself. The values of peak stress were of the same order, with slightly higher for filled tubes (1.02 and 1.13 times higher for quasistatic and dynamic compression, respectively). As for densification stress, 1.38 and 1.79 higher values were obtain, almost the double relatively to empty tubes in the dynamic conditions. However, the densification strain is 1.22 and 1.52 times lower at quasi-static and dynamic conditions, respectively.\nThese tests revealed a similar behaviour with open-cell foams relatively to strain rate sensitivity, with higher mechanical responses in dynamic conditions. Final deformation of the dynamic specimens is represented in figure 4.6.1. One of the problem of these specimens, as verified in figure 4.6.1 is the irregular behaviour and deformation modes.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.14: (a) Foam filled tubes with closed-cell foams stress-strain curves, and progressive deformation: (b) quasi-static and (c) dynamic.\nFigure 4.15: Final deformation of FFts with closed-cell foams.\n4.6.2\tIn-situ closed-cell foam filled tubes\nIn table 4.13 it is presented different in-situ specimens and correspondent densities and Young\u2019s modulus. It is evident the difference of Young\u2019s modulus to similar densities which can be justified by defects on the tube\u2019s wall of eventual difficulties in the bonding of the tube\u2019s wall and the foam during the manufacturing process. The fact of the presented values being lower than the ones for ex-situ FFTs, is justified by the manufacturing process, which decreases the stiffness of the specimen.\nTable 4.13: Young\u2019s modulus of in-situ foam filled tubes with closed-cell foams.\nSpecimen\t\tDensity [kg/m3 ]\tYoung Modulus [MPa]\tError -\nFFTs_\tInCF-1\t0,46\t718,448\t0,9958\nFFTs_\tInCF-2\t0,44\t525,975\t0,9967\nFFTs_\tInCF-3\t0,46\t440,176\t0,9976\nFFTs_\t_InCF-4\t0,49\t1281,594\t0,9921\nFFTs_\t_InCF-5\t0,49\t558,129\t0,9913\nFFTs_\tInCF-6\t0,57\t1083,951\t0,9934\nBehaviour of in-situ foam filled tubes is quite similar to ex-situ FFTs, having an even higher capability of load transfer from and for the tube\u2019s wall. As in the previous specimens, the effect of density is obvious.\nRelatively to quasi-static tests, observing figure 4.16(a), it is observed that only the specimen with the lower density InCF-2 contains a peak and minimum, similarly to the thin-walled tube\u2019s behaviour. In the other specimens, the behaviour was attenuated by the presence of the foam. The stress-strain curves presented are even more soft than the ex-situ ones. From figure 4.16(b) it is possible to sight the extensional deformation mode of the specimens.\nAs for to dynamic analysis, it is quite similar to quasi-static one. Figure 4.16(a) shows the similar behaviour of both specimens InCF-4 and InCF-5 with 0.49 g/cm3, as expected. Small differences can be justified by the non-existence of total bond of the foam to the tube\u2019s wall. This is justified by the manufacturing process - which presents more difficulties related to the bond than in circular tubes - due to the existence of corners. Therefore the expansion of the foam inside the tube should be done properly,\nwith the less gaps possible.\nIn-situ FFTs should be compared with empty tubes, but also with ex-situ FFTs (table 4.14. In any case, in-situ FFTs revealed a proper behaviour. Obtained values of peak stress were almost equal to the ones in empty-tubes and ex-situ FFTs. The main difference is related to densification stress, where in-situ FFTs present 1.89(quasi-static) and 2.00(dynamic) higher values when compared to empty tubes. As for ex-situ FFTs, the difference is less, with 1.37 for quasi-static conditions and 1.11 higher for dynamic ones, but at lower strains.\nAs ex-situ specimens, in-situ FFTs revealed influence of velocity, with higher peak stresses, corresponding to strain rate sensitivity. The final dynamic deformation of the specimens is represented in figure 4.6.2, strengthening the conclusion of a stable behaviour and no rupture of these specimens.\nTable 4.14: Properties of the ex-situ and in-situ FFTs.\nSpecimen Velocity Density\tElastic region\tMinium Densif. region\n\t[MPa]\t\t\t\u00ca\ta\t\u00ca\ta\t\u00cadens\tadens\nCF-1\t1\t0.19\t1587.628\t0.050\t37.71\t0.35\t19.00\t0.563\t23.94\nCF-2\t1\t0.29\t2371.236\t0.050\t40.04\t0.38\t22.35\t0.526\t25.54\nCF-3\t1\t0.29\t2490.344\t0.066\t39.63\t\t\t0.495\t24.50\nCF-4\t1\t0.42\t3083.490\t0.052\t40.47\t\t\t0.492\t32.68\nCF-5\t284\t0.41\t2713.134\t0.636\t43.07\t\t\t0.432\t28.54\nCF-6\t284\t0.48\t1267.630\t0.066\t43.17\t\t\t0.391\t31.64\nCF-7\t284\t0.52\t2431.068\t0.066\t45.41\t0.36\t30.92\t0.494\t39.18\nCF-8\t284\t0.53\t1254.523\t0.076\t46.41\t\t\t0.331\t33.47\nInCF-1\t1\t0.46\t718.448\t0.093\t38.550\t\t\t0.32\t30.93\nInCF-2\t1\t0.44\t525.975\t0.098\t37.57\t0.28\t33.24\t0.411\t34.42\nInCF-3\t1\t0.46\t442.033\t0.096\t37.11\t\t\t0.421\t34.39\nInCF-4\t284\t0.49\t1281.594\t0.080\t41.33\t\t\t0.333\t36.26\nInCF-5\t284\t0.49\t558.129\t0.107\t40.16\t\t\t0.290\t35.76\nInCF-6\t284\t0.57\t1083.951\t0.096\t47.31\t\t\t0.302\t43.08\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.16: (a) Foam filled tubes with in-situ closed-cell foams stress-strain curves, and progressive deformation: (b) quasi-static and (c) dynamic.\nFigure 4.17: Final deformation of in-situ FFts.\n4.7\tConcluding remarks\nFrom figure 4.18 it is possible to observe the different behaviours with higher curves corresponding to the epoxy embedded specimens, followed by the FFTs with closed cells, ex-situ and in-situ. It is also possible to observe the unstable behaviour of the FFTs with open-cell cores embedded with silicone comparative to the other specimens, specially in figure 4.19. It is also easier to observe the differences between the slope of different tubes, with lower slopes corresponding to the in-situ specimens, due to the manufacturing process.\nFigure 4.18: Average stress-strain curves for different FFTs.\nFigure 4.19: Average stress-strain curves for different FFTs without epoxy specimen.\nIn order to analyse the different FFTs a dimensionless comparison is made in figures\n4.7\tand 4.7. They present, respectively, dimensionless comparisons of peak and densification steps, focusing either on strain as on stress. This analysis is made taken into account the maximum value of the characteristic in analysis, e.g. peak strain. Then, the peak strain values of other specimens are divided by it, obtaining normalized values between 0 and 1.\nThe first highlighted characteristic of these plots is the dynamic behaviour, with higher values than the quasi-static ones, except on the strain values of densification for in-situ specimens.\nRelatively to figure 4.20(a), it is notorious the similar behaviour of FFTs with open-foams embedded with epoxy and the in-situ specimens, with similar adimentional strains but slightly higher to the latter. As for figure 4.20(b), it is visible the similar behaviour of the different specimens, either in quasi-static and dynamic analysis, with the exception of the quasi-static behaviour of epoxy FFTs, which have an average of peak stress more than two times higher than the others.\nAs for densification strain, the higher values are obtained for the thin-walled tubes (ET), FFTs with open-cell foams and the specimens with epoxy. Relatively to densi-fication stress, the higher values are obtained by the in-situ and specimens with epoxy, with FFTs with closed-cell foams very near.\nThis analysis complements the individual analysis, high-lightening the behaviour of insitu FFTs and FFTs with open-cell foams embedded with epoxy. However, it must not be forgotten the contrast showed in the deformation modes of both of them. The FFTs with open-cell foams embedded with epoxy presented a behaviour in which rupture and cracks occurred, while in-situ FFTs presents a highly stable and predictable behaviour.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.20: Average of dimensionless: (a) peak strain and (b) peak stress, at quasi-static and dynamic conditions.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.21: Average of dimensionless: (a) densification strain and (b) densification stress, at quasi-static and dynamic conditions.\n4.8\tEnergy absorption capabilities\n4.8.1\tCores energy absorption\nThe following analysis is divided between energy absorption (W) and specific energy absorption (Ws), which is the energy divided by the mass of each specimen.\nOpen-cell foams without filler exhibit a behaviour in which energy absorption capacity increases with higher densities, as represented in figure 4.22. The values presented for different strains at table 4.15, presents a range between [0.010 - 0.207] for quasi-static compression and of [0.022-0.254] to dynamic tests, for strains up to 0.7.\nRelatively to open-cell foams with silicone fillers (figure 4.23), there is also a direct relation with foam density. Besides this, there is an alternative way of energy dissipation, due to liberation of the silicone filler. This ends up increasing the values of energy absorption to values 3 times higher when compared to open-cell foams. However, relatively to specific energy, the results are worst than for open-cell without filler. This is justified by the increase in the specimen\u2019s mass due to the silicone filler.\nThe behaviour and energy absorption capability of open-cell foams embedded with epoxy (figure 4.24) presents slightly differences with density, but they\u2019re not so relevant as in other type of specimens. The energy curve, in contrast to the exponential behaviour of the other ones, exhibits almost a linear behaviour. These specimens present higher energy absorption than any other core, either open or closed. However, when comparing the specific energy absorption represented in figures 4.28(a) and 4.29 several details must be taken into account. The specific energy curve, similarly to the energy curve, presents a linear behaviour in contrast to the exponential curve of the other specimens. The energy absorption values are much higher than the other cores, but when it comes to the specific energy that doesn\u2019t happen. The values are quite similar to the closed-cell foams with an important difference, the mass of the specimens. The closed cells present an average mass of approximately 3.303 g while the open-cell embedded with epoxy have an average mass of 14.300g, more than 4 times higher.\nAs for closed-cell foams, it is notorious the influence of density with higher performances from the specimens with higher density. As in the stress-strain analysis, there is also important to analyse the influence of the surface skin which doesn\u2019t exist in the lower curve\u2019s specimen. Therefore, a direct correlation between the existence of surface skin and energy absorption is made, according to previous works [19] . As for closed-cell foams (figure 4.25), they absorb 20 times more energy than those of open-cell structure. As all the other specimens, higher densities correspond to higher capabilities of energy absorption. Simultaneously, the existence of the surface skin works as an improvement, increasing the energy absorption capacity of the foam.\nFigure 4.26 represents the energy absorption capacity of the different cores, with the highlighted behaviour of open-foam embedded with epoxy, which presents a far higher curve than the other specimens. As for figure 4.29, represents the different specific energy absorption capacity of the different cores. Once more, foam embedded with epoxy presents a higher curve. However, these have more weight than the closed-cell foams, presenting an obstacle in further applications in lightweight structures.\nFigure 4.22: Energy absorption for open-cell foams.\nFigure 4.23: Energy absorption for open-cell foams embedded with silicone.\nFigure 4.24: Energy absorption for open-cell foams embedded with epoxy.\nFigure 4.25: Energy absorption for closed-cell foams.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.26: Average of the energy curves for the different cores: (a) with epoxy specimen and (b) without epoxy specimen.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.27: Specific energy absorption for: (a) open-cell core and (b) open-cell foam embedded with silicone.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.28: Specific energy absorption for open-cell foams embedded with epoxy a) and closed-cell foams b).\nFigure 4.29: Average of the specific energy curves for the different cores.\nTable 4.15: Cores and respective energy absorption values at different strains.\nSpecimen\t@0.1\t@0.2\t@0.3\t@0.4\t@0.5\t@0.6\t@0.7\nOF-1\t0.010\t0.036\t0.058\t0.085\t0.109\t0.139\t0.184\nOF-2\t0.021\t0.042\t0.063\t0.088\t0.113\t0.148\t0.198\nOF-3\t0.021\t0.045\t0072\t0098\t0.124\t0.154\t0.207\nOF-4\t0.022\t0.047\t0.078\t0.109\t0.137\t0.175\t0.237\nOF-5\t0.023\t0.048\t0.079\t0.116\t0.147\t0.185\t0.254\nOF-6\t0.027\t0.052\t0.087\t0.117\t0.145\t0.184\t0.252\nSF-1\t0.012\t0.055\t0.107\t0.165\t0.238\t0.338\t0.490\nSF-2\t0.036\t0.087\t0.145\t0.216\t0.312\t0.454\t0.712\nSF-3\t0.032\t0.079\t0.134\t0.199\t0.288\t0.417\t0.639\nSF-4\t0.024\t0.065\t0.126\t0.200\t0.303\t0.461\t0.772\nSF-5\t0.028\t0.072\t0.137\t0.219\t0.328\t0.517\t0.904\nSF-6\t0.022\t0.069\t0.133\t0.206\t0.304\t0.465\t0.781\nEF-1\t3.721\t9.083\t14.449\t20.430\t27.017\t32.787\t39.478\nEF-2\t4.939\t10.247\t15.579\t21.663\t29.435\t37.665\t-(45.258)\nEF-3\t5.109\t10.349\t15.757\t22.016\t29.906\t37.592\t45.541\nCF-1\t0.048\t0.104\t0.182\t0.278\t0.404\t0.583\t0.889\nCF-2\t0.273\t0.588\t0.926\t1.303\t1.750\t2.304\t3.139\nCF-3\t0.279\t0.581\t0.898\t1.235\t1.604\t2.062\t2.686\nCF-4\t0.322\t0827\t1.407\t2.092\t3.004\t4.199\t5.879\nCF-5\t0.350\t0.815\t1.382\t2.059\t2.894\t4.091\t5.982\nCF-6\t0.354\t0.851\t1.376\t1.978\t2.657\t3.531\t4.994\nCF-7\t0.594\t1.356\t2.193\t3.223\t4.611\t6.504\t9.402\nCF-8\t0.604\t1.460\t2.431\t6.546\t4.863\t6.671\t9.709\n4.8.2\tThin-walled tubes and foam filled tubes energy absorption\nThin-walled tubes were testes and energy curves were obtained (figure 4.30(a)) in order to a better comparison between the properties of these ones and the ones with filled tubes.\nRelatively to foam filled tubes with open-cells, is observable in figure 4.30(b) a direct relationship between foam density and energy absorption capacity. This capacity is quite similar to the closed-cell foam, ex-situ and in-situ, but still a little lower, as also for empty tubes.\nComparatively to the open-cells filled with silicone and epoxy, open-cell with no filler has also lower curves. As for specific energy absorption (figure 4.33(b)), open-cells foams exhibit a very good behaviour, with values quite proximate to the ones of the empty tubes and closed-cell foams. This is justified their reduced weight, due to their open-structure without cell-walls.\nFoam filled tubes with open-cell foams embedded with silicone (figure 4.31(a)) exhibit values or energy absorption similar to the FFTs with open-cell and closed cell fillers. However when it comes to specific energy absorption (figure 4.34(a)) silicone doesn't present so good behaviour. As explained above when analysing the open-cell core embedded with silicone, the polymer adds weight to the specimen. This is what happens in the FFTs test as well, reducing its capacity of energy absorption by mass at a level too low to be used as an viable alternative to the empty tube by itself.\nAs for FFTs with open-cell foams embedded with epoxy (figure 4.31(b))the range of densities of the specimens doesn't allow to take conclusions in this matter. However, both of the specimens present similar behaviours, with higher curves than the ones of empty tubes and the remaining existing fillers.\nAs for specific energy absorption, represented in figure 4.34(b), higher curves are also obtained. However, the mass of the specimens is much higher, for example, than the ones of empty-tubes and closed-cell foams, 2.5 and 1.5 times higher, respectively. Another problem with epoxy FFTs is the fact that rupture occurs and part of the energy absorption in during this phase. Taking into account the interest of automotive industry in the absorption of impacts without rupture of material, the importance of the higher curve of epoxy is diminished.\nAs for FFTs with closed-cell foams (figure 4.32(a)), it is possible to observe a direct relation between foam's density and energy absorption capacity. These curves are quite similar to the ones of empty-tubes, but slightly higher. As for specific energy absorption, the scenario inverts, and the empty tube's curves are slightly higher. These results are in accordance with previous works of Duarte et al [32], but in that case for circular specimens. However, that is not necessarily a disadvantage, once the presence of the foam increases the tube's stiffness, but also prevents fracture of the tube, absorbing part of the impact.\nLastly, in-situ FFTs analysis, represented in figure 4.32(b). Relatively to energy absorption, these specimens presents behaviours quite similar to the closed-cell foams, with high influence of density. As for specific energy absorption capacity, figure 4.35(b), these specimens present a behaviour influenced differently by the density. In this case, lower densities have an higher capacity of energy absorption per unit of mass, once lower densities correspond to lower weights and consequently higher values of energy absorbed per mass unit. However this behaviour it is not uniform, probably due to the\nbonding between the foam and the tube\u2019s wall. When compared with empty tubes, these specimens present lower curves. However, as in the previous case of closed-cell foams, there is an improvement in the stiffness of the tube.\nBetter results are not acquired due to the expansion of the foam inside of the tube, once it lowers the tube\u2019s mechanical properties.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.30: Energy absorption capacity of: (a) thin-walled tubes and (b) FFTs with open-cell foams.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.31: Energy absorption capacity of FFTs: (a) with open-cell foams embedded with silicone; (b) with open-cell foams embedded with epoxy.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.32: Energy absorption capacity of FFTs: (a) with ex-situ closed-cell foams; (b) with in-situ closed-cell foams.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.33: Specific energy absorption capacity of: (a) thin walled tubes and (b) FFTs with open-cell foams.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.34: Energy absorption capacity of FFTs: (a) with open-cell foams embedded with silicone; (b) with open-cell foams embedded with epoxy.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.35: Specific energy absorption capacity of FFTs: (a) with ex-situ closed-cell foams; (b) in-situ FFTs.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.36: Average of: (a) energy absorption capacity of FFTs and (b) specific energy absorption.\nTable 4.16: Energy absorption of the different foam filled tubes.\nSpecimen\t@0.1\t@0.2\t@0.3\t@0.4\t@0.5\t@0.6\t@0.7\nT25-1\t3.304\t6.379\t8.827\t10.927\t12.891\t14.889\t17.625\nT25-2\t3.124\t5.862\t8.032\t9.981\t12.011\t13.795\t15971\nT25-3\t3.140\t5.979\t8.234\t10.474\t12.542\t14.196\t15.974\nT25-4\t3.424\t6.573\t8.979\t11.028\t13.079\t14.905\t17.124\nT25-5\t3.362\t6.742\t9.338\t11.473\t13.397\t15.334\t18.006\nT25-6\t3.315\t6.329\t8.652\t10.581\t12.427\t14.187\t16.379\nOF-1\t2.928\t5.468\t7.481\t9.249\t11.123\t12.972\t16.395\nOF-2\t3.155\t5.946\t8.164\t10.600\t12.804\t14.570\t17.150\nOF-3\t3.263\t6.420\t8.899\t11.128\t13.291\t15.222\t17.733\nOF-4\t3.179\t6.161\t8.552\t10.617\t12.942\t15.341\t18.274\nOF-5\t2.969\t5768\t8.067\t9.951\t11.578\t13.221\t15.924\nOF-6\t3.113\t6.027\t8.404\t10.359\t12.073\t13.704\t16.648\nSF-1\t2.921\t6.135\t9.263\t12.078\t-\t-\t-\nSF-2\t2.555\t5.839\t8.973\t12.216\t15.223\t17.973\t21.106\nSF-3\t3.257\t6.734\t10.099\t13.005\t15.182\t17.664\t20.201\nSF-4\t3.040\t6.340\t9.584\t12.915\t14.899\t16.889\t20.428\nSF-5\t3.266\t6.742\t10.044\t13.184\t15.948\t17.793\t20.045\nEF-1\t6.640\t15.233\t23.967\t34.222\t45.475\t57.202\t72.221\nEF-2\t6.528\t15.225\t24.077\t64.623\t46.241\t56.719\t71.059\nCF-1\t3.116\t5.901\t8.061\t10.077\t12.061\t15.021\t19.059\nCF-2\t3.289\t6.437\t8.960\t11.209\t13.826\t16.510\t-\nCF-3\t2.716\t6.179\t9.001\t11.439\t13.813\t16.619\t20.866\nCF-4\t3.487\t7.054\t10.301\t12.873\t15.902\t19.597\t-\nCF-5\t3.642\t7.483\t10.765\t13.663\t16.648\t19.977\t25.095\nCF-6\t3.222\t7.125\t10.555\t13.770\t17.070\t20.929\t-\nCF-7\t3.777\t7.697\t11.021\t14.136\t17.764\t22.927\t-\nCF-8\t3.078\t7.304\t10.903\t14.281\t18.006\t22.897\t-\ninCF-1\t2.632\t6.362\t9.642\t12.791\t16.632\t22.086\t-\ninCF-2\t2.187\t5.876\t9.304\t12.629\t16.429\t21.770\t-\ninCF-3\t2.392\t6.078\t9.553\t12.981\t16.579\t21.798\t-\ninCF-4\t3.328\t7.368\t11.078\t14.759\t18.766\t24.423\t-\ninCF-5\t2.495\t6.486\t10.188\t13.801\t17.749\t12.546\t-\ninCF-6\t3.388\t8.053\t12.439\t16.869\t22.293\t-\t-\nIntentionally blank page.\nChapter 5\nSummary\n5.1\tConclusions\nThe present work presents the main results of a systematic study in which the crush performance and deformation modes of the square tubes filled with different foam fillers (closed-cell foams, open-cell foams and hybrid foams were evaluated using uniaxial compressive tests under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions, supported by infrared thermography. The performance of these structures was compared to the performance of individual components (empty aluminium tubes and foam filler), as well as to each other. The results presented in this thesis enable to draw the following conclusions:\n\u2022\tThe mechanical parameters (e.g., plateau stress, yield stress and densification strain) of the foam fillers studied increase with their density.\n\u2022\tThe presence of surface skin in the aluminium alloy foams prepared by PCF method leads to higher compressive response showing a smooth plateau stress with minimising effects of the structural imperfections and defects. The closed Al-alloy foams without skin, or even the open-cell foams exhibit fluctuations in the plateau region of the compressive strain-stress curves that could lead a high scatter of the mechanical properties.\n\u2022\tThe studied foams display strain rate sensitivity. The loading conditions affect the load carrying capacity and the energy absorption in conjunction with other parameters like the foam density and the structural imperfections of the cellular structure.\n\u2022\tThe initial brittle behaviour of the open-cell foams is stabilized by using a polymer filler (silicone or epoxy), resulting in improved mechanical properties and significantly higher energy absorption capability of the cellular structure. The enhancement effect of the epoxy on the compressive responses of the aluminium foams is higher than that of the silicone.\n\u2022\tThe efficiencies of the foam filling on energy absorption capacity depend not only on the base material of the structure, but also the foam density filler.\n\u2022\tFoam-filled structures have shown advantageous mechanical properties and energy absorption capabilities in case of compressive loading.\n\u2022\tThe compressive response and the energy absorption increase by increasing the foam density. The tubes filled with highest density foam prove to be the most efficient in terms of the peak stress and energy absorption capacity.\n\u2022\tFoam filled tubes embedded with silicone and epoxy present rupture of tube\u2019s wall and consequent expelling of the filler material.\n\u2022\tThe in-situ FFTs show much more progressive and stable crushing behaviour under compressive loads. They deform by extensional deformation mode, without the formation and propagation of visible cracks, as was observed in the other FFTs. The structural changes suffered by the empty tubes during the manufacturing process of in-situ FFTs positively affect the crashworthiness and the ductility, ensuring the controlled folding, while avoiding stress concentrations severe enough to initiate cracking. However, the structural changes decrease the load bearing capacity, which is also reflected in the lower energy absorption capability.\n5.2\tFuture works\nFrom these findings of this research, some future works are suggested in this topic field that are as follows:\n\u2022\tFurther quasi-static and dynamic experimental testing under different crush loads should be undertaken to build a complete database of the results. These additional data would reinforce the present research findings. Further analysis should be done for a wide range of geometry and dimensions, material and loading conditions.\n\u2022\tThe materials should be tested using different mechanical tests - fatigue, bending tests.\n\u2022\tFurther investigation should be performed to study other types of alternative foam fillers, including hybrid foams.\n\u2022\tOptimization studies should be performed to predict the optimum density and geometry of foam filler in order to maximize the amount of energy absorbed.\nIntentionally blank page.\nBibliography\n[1]\t\u201cHoneycomb,\u201d 2015.
