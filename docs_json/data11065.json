M\u00e9todos: Participaram dez crian\u00e7as e adolescentes com a faixa et\u00e1ria entre 4 e 13 anos, de ambos \n\nos g\u00eaneros, com diagn\u00f3sticos estabelecidos entre os Transtornos do Espectro do Autismo. Para a coleta de \n\ndados, foram realizadas oito filmagens durante sess\u00f5es de terapia de linguagem individual com dura\u00e7\u00e3o de 30 \n\nminutos, sendo quatro em sala com organiza\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental convencional (sala comum) e quatro em sala com \n\nambienta\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica (sala NIC), intercaladamente, durante um m\u00eas.

The social and affective deficits in the ASD \nare associated with cognitive damage that leads to a poor \ndevelopment in the game, therefore the child does not have \nappropriate emotional and cultural cycles for a typical \ndevelopment(3). For the speech therapy practice, knowl-\nedge on the existent variations in the relations between \nthe areas is extremely important in the intervention pro-\ncess, because it shows that peculiarities of the delays in \nlanguage development may be analyzed under different \nperspectives(2).\n\nAnother aspect that should be considered in speech \ntherapy interventions is related to the variables concern-\ning the environmental context of language therapy(7-10). \nSeveral researchers, based on a pragmatic perspective of \nthe language, pointed out the importance of the context \nfor communication(7,8).\n\nThe context in which communication occurs is com-\nplex and includes multidimensional aspects; therefore, its \nanalysis is very important to investigate characteristics \nassociated with communication(11) such as the sociocog-\nnitive performance. For subjects with ASD, development \ncan be favored in environments that are comprehensive and \nmake its evolution easier and can be adjusted to its limita-\ntions(10), and they can possibly be significantly modified \nfrom one context to another(12).\n\nFurthermore, literature mentions the importance that \nenvironmental context has on aspects such as behavior, \nattention, and expressive language in subjects with ASD(13-15).\n\nThus, scientific investigations are required on the lan-\nguage and cognitive aspects in the subjects with ASD, \nwhich take into consideration the different context ele-\nments that may interfere in the development of children \nwith ASD(7,8). Thus, the objective of this study was to ana-\nlyze the sociocognitive performance of children and ado-\nlescents with ASD in two language therapy environments, \nwhich differ as to the physical structure.\n\nThe hypothesis that led us to carry out this study was \nthe result of theoretical referential associated with clinical \nexercise showing that children with ASD might present a \nbetter communication performance in an environment that \nis structured, functional, and familiar to the child than in \na conventional room of speech therapy.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis research was approved by the research ethics com-\nmittee of Faculdade de Filosofia e Ci\u00eancias of Universidade \n\nEstadual Paulista \u201cJ\u00falio de Mesquita Filho\u201d (UNESP), Mar\u00edlia \nCampus, under protocol number 968/2003. All people in \ncharge for the participants signed the free informed consent \naccording to resolution 196/96 of the Brazilian National \nHealth Counsel (NHC).\n\nSubjects\n\nTe n  c h i l d r e n  a n d  a d o l e s c e n t s  a g e d  4 \u2013 1 3  y e a r s \n(mean\u00a0 = \u00a0 7.9\u00a0 years) were included in this research, six \nmale and four female. All of them were diagnosed with \nASD, and diagnoses were performed by a psychiatry fol-\nlowing specific criteria(16,17). Subjects were going through \na speech therapeutic process during a period from 1 to \n6\u00a0years, and the following criteria were not considered as \nexclusion characteristics: age, sex, education, use of ver-\nbal or nonverbal communication, and IQ.\n\nChart 1 presents data concerning age, sex, and speech ther-\napy period of each subject.\n\nData were collected at the end of the school year of the \nfourth-year therapists; thus, children were receiving treatment \nwith the same therapist for a period of around 9 months.\n\nProcedures\n\nData were collected inside the Health and Education Study \nCenter (CEES) of Faculdade de Filosofia e Ci\u00eancias of UNESP, \nMar\u00edlia Campus.\n\nThis is a cross-sectional study, in which filming sessions \nhappened in two rooms called common room and children\u2019s \ninteraction core (CIC) room, with different physical structures. \nThe common room presented a conventional environmental \norganization generally used in speech therapy, measuring 9 m2 \nincluding table, chairs, cabinet, small mattress, and toys that \nwere available inside a cabinet for each subject to use. However, \nthe CIC room measured around 30 m2 and had furniture adapted \nfor small children and for its respective environment, such as \nkitchen (sink, stove, microwave stove, fridge, and table), liv-\ning room (armchair and table), bedroom (wardrobe, dressing \ntable, bed, cradle, and dolls), and other toys with the aim of \nrepresenting a copy of the house.\n\nChart 1.

In the beginning \nof every session, the therapist opened the cabinet and the \nchild chose the toys he/she would like to get. The child \nwas free to request or open the cabinet to catch other toys \nthroughout the speech therapy session.\n\nIn the CIC room, toys were exposed according to their \nfunctionality and they were at children\u2019s disposal. In both \nsituations, therapists were requested to establish a free \ngame situation, providing interaction, according to the \ninterests shown by the child.\n\nAll subjects had been previously cared in two routine \nsessions, in both rooms. Thus, they were acquainted with \nthese ambiances.\n\nFor data collection, filming equipment to record the \nspeech therapy sessions was used.\n\nEight filming sessions of individual language therapy \nwere recorded for each subject with ASD, during a 1-month \nperiod, and four of them were carried out in the common \nroom and four in the CIC room, interposed. Initially, the \nfilming session were done in the CIC room with all partic-\nipants, following the order: CIC room/common room for \ndata collection. Thus, 80 filming sessions were performed: \n40 ones lasting 30 minutes in each room, totalizing 2,400 \nminutes or 40 hours of observation.\n\nTo analyze sociocognitive performance of children \nwith ASD during the filmed situations, the Sociocognitive \nPerformance Protocol(18) was used. In the analysis using \nsuch protocol, collected data were registered with numbers \naccording to the best performance of each child in every \narea analyzed in the protocol: \n1. gestural communicative intention, \n2. vocal communicative intention, \n3. use of mediator object, \n4. gestural imitation, \n5. vocal imitation, \n6. combinatory game, and \n7. symbolic game.\n\nEach area presents a minimum and a maximum score \nfor classification according to child\u2019s performance. The \ngestural communicative intention, vocal communicative \nintention, combinatory game, and symbolic game areas pre-\nsented scores that varied from one to six, that is, the higher \nthe grade is, the better is the performance in that area. In \nthe gestural imitation, vocal imitation, and use of mediator \nobject areas, the scores ranged from one to four, in which \nthe highest classification corresponds to the best perfor-\nmance. All data were analyzed and transcribed and, later, \nthe interobserver concordance index verification was carried \nout. The two judges were speech therapists graduated and \n\nexperienced in infantile psychiatry and equivalent experi-\nence in using the analysis instrument. Therefore, eight film-\ning situations were sorted so that each judge could analyze \nthem, four in the CIC room and four in the common room. \nTo calculate the concordance between judges and the first \nauthor researcher of this study about the sociocognitive \naspects, the following mathematical formula was used: \n(100-|n1 - n2|/n maximum)x100. The concordance between \njudges and the researcher was of 99.97%.\n\nFor the analysis of results, the best performance of each \nsubject in every studied room was considered. From these \ndata, the statistical analysis was carried out using Student\u2019s \nt-test to compare results concerning the sociocognitive per-\nformance in every room. The 5% significance level (p<0.05) \nwas used to apply the statistical test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTable 1 presents the score of the best performances in the \ngestural communicative intention (GCI), vocal communicative \nintention (VCI), use of the mediator object (UMO), gestural \nimitation (GI), vocal imitation (VI), combinatory game (CG), \nand symbolic game (SG) during the eight sessions, in the com-\nmon and CIC rooms, respectively.\n\nTable 2 shows the scores summary of the sociocognitive \nperformance of the subjects with ASD in the common and CIC \nrooms through means and standard deviation of scores obtained \nfrom the Sociocognitive Performance Protocol. Besides, it \nalso presents results related to the comparative analysis of the \nsociocognitive performance of 10 subjects in the common and \nCIC rooms.\n\nIt was also seen, after applying the Student\u2019s t-test for paired \ndata, that there was no significant difference in the sociocog-\nnitive performance of 10 subjects in the common and CIC \nrooms (Table 2).\n\nTable 1.

These find-\nings are in agreement with those seen by other authors who \nalso mentioned that the subjects with ASD may present simi-\nlar sociocognitive performance in the different communicative \nsituations studied(2).\n\nIn the gestural communicative intention area, most individ-\nuals presented similar performance in both rooms; therefore, \nthis aspect did not present a variation due to the environment \ncontext. A study(18) spontaneously and directly performed also \ncould not find a difference in this area, probably because the \nchild would not need to make use of gestures to get the toy, \nbecause there were several toys at his/her disposal.\n\nIn addition, it was seen that 70% of the subjects had similar \nperformance in the vocal communicative intention in the com-\nmon and CIC rooms, therefore the context did not interfere in \nthis aspect. However, a study(18) states that when the child has \nverbal language, he/she will probably use it in any moment \nduring the 30 minutes of the filming session, indicating that \nsuch aspect may happen regardless of the environment context.\n\nNo mediator object was used in 30% of the subjects, and \nthe worst performance was seen in 40% of the subjects in the \ncommon and CIC rooms, being the best one in 20% in the CIC \nroom. Only 4% of the subjects presented better performance in \nthe common room. These data confirm the findings of a study(19) \n\nthat emphasized the worst performance of this aspect in spon-\ntaneous communicative situations.\n\nAs to the combinatory game, most subjects (70%) presented \nsimilar performance in the two studied rooms. These data can be \ncompared to the findings of a study(18) showing that the sponta-\nneous situation favors the appearance of a combinatory game.\n\nOf the 10 studied subjects, 60% presented similar perfor-\nmance in the symbolic game in both rooms, and the others (40%) \nhad better performance in the CIC room. A study(18) indicates \nthat the subjects with ASD showed better performance for the \nsymbolic game in the test situation than in the spontaneous one. \nIn this study, the CIC room seems to favor the appearance of \nthe symbolic game because materials were exposed according \nto their functionality and were at children\u2019s reach.\n\nIt should be mentioned that a higher number of subjects \npresented better performance in the CIC room compared to \nthe vocal imitation (60% of the subjects). Half of them (50% \nof the subjects) for the gestural imitation area, only 20% of the \nsubjects achieved better performance in the common room and \n30% presented similar performance in the two rooms, as shown \nin Table 1. These data confirm the statement(20) that physical \ncontexts such as tables and chairs tend to provide less possi-\nbilities of gesture expression than large environments such as \nthe CIC room.\n\nAccording to other authors(10,21), different contexts in situ-\nations of individual speech therapy for the subjects with ASD \nimply differences of performance, but such changes are also \nrelated to time and interference of several speakers and not only \nto the context. Regardless of the physical environment and of \nthe adopted therapeutic proposal, the speech therapist will be \nin charge of process distinction acting like an ideal speaker and \na mediator of the therapeutic process(7).\n\nWhen analyzing individual tendencies, there were some \ncharacteristics that are in agreement with those of the other \nauthors(2,3,5) who saw heterogeneity in the sociocognitive per-\nformance of the subjects with ASD. It is important to explore \nindividual differences because they are associated with diag-\nnosis and prognosis of language and interaction of the children \nwith ASD, besides they help creating strategies of interventions \nmore directed to the needs of each case(22).\n\nSociocognitive performance can be used as a support instru-\nment in the therapeutic process, making the identification of \nvariables that may interfere in the communicative performance \neasier(2). Thus, the study on sociocognitive aspects of the sub-\njects with ASD can offer subsidies to prepare and use new \ntechniques and procedures that favor the communicative pro-\ncess efficiently(2,3).\n\nData presented herein suggest the need of new researches \nsuch as longitudinal studies about the interference of the physi-\ncal context, to better clarify the possible interferences related \nto the sociocognitive performance of the subjects with ASD in \ndifferent ambiances of language therapy.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAnalysis of the relations between sociocognitive performance \nof children and adolescents with ASD and physical structure \n\nTable 2.
