Contudo, a maioria dos trabalhos nesta \u00e1rea tem sido \nfeita utilizando filmes porosos destacados devido \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de uma barreira no \nfundo dos poros. No entanto, esta estrat\u00e9gia segue demasiados passos, o que \naumenta o seu custo, torna mais dif\u00edcil a execu\u00e7\u00e3o e imp\u00f5e v\u00e1rias limita\u00e7\u00f5es. \nConsequentemente, existe a necessidade de uma t\u00e9cnica que permita o \nenchimento (electrofilling) dos tubos sem remover a camada barreira \u2013 esta tese \nrepresenta o nosso contributo para esse trabalho. Utiliz\u00e1mos uma t\u00e9cnica mais \nsimples que permite a electrodeposi\u00e7\u00e3o e \u201celectrofilling\u201d de nanoestruturas \ndirectamente nos modelos sobre o substrato met\u00e1lico, utilizando solventes  \neut\u00e9cticos profundos \u00e0 base de cloreto de colina como electr\u00f3lito. Relativamente \n\u00e0 \u00e1gua, os solventes eut\u00e9cticos profundos demonstram superior estabilidade \nt\u00e9rmica e uma janela electroqu\u00edmica mais alargada, o que aumenta o n\u00famero \nde materais secund\u00e1rios depositados. \nComo materiais a investigar foram escolhidos tit\u00e2nia e alumina dada a sua \ncapacidade para formar estruturas porosas altamente ordenadas, propriedades \neletroqu\u00edmicas distintas e uso generalizado em s\u00edntese assistida por padr\u00e3o. O \nestudo aqui apresentado encontra-se dividido em duas etapas. Primeiramente, \na influ\u00eancia da camada barreira foi investigada em sistemas modelo atrav\u00e9s da \nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes barreira densos na superf\u00edcie dos el\u00e9trodos. Para os filmes \nde alumina e tit\u00e2nia, identificaram-se v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros que afectam a \nelectrodeposi\u00e7\u00e3o, dos quais se destacam a influ\u00eancia da voltagem de \nanodiza\u00e7\u00e3o, a espessura da camada de barreira, a dupla camada el\u00e9ctrica e o \nperfil de corrente. Durante esta etapa detectaram-se efeitos nefastos, como a \nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma densa camada org\u00e2nica na superf\u00edcie do el\u00e9ctrodo, que foram \nultrapassados aumentando a temperatura ou alternando o potencial aplicado. \nA segunda etapa consistiu em passar de el\u00e9trodos planos (primeira etapa) para \nmodelos porosos (segunda etapa). Foi realizado, com sucesso, o \npreenchimento dos poros de alumina e dos poros de tit\u00e2nia. Par\u00e2metros como \no perfil de corrente, temperatura de solu\u00e7\u00e3o, entre outras, foram ajustadas para \nmelhorar o fator de preenchimento e a homogeneidade do preenchimento. Foi \ndesenvolvido um processo de preenchimento de moldes de alumina an\u00f3dica em \nduas etapas, nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o AC (1\u00ba passo) e preenchimento galvanost\u00e1tico (2\u00ba \npasso). Foram utilizadas tr\u00eas condi\u00e7\u00f5es diferentes de modelos de tit\u00e2nia an\u00f3dica \nporosa no \u201celectrofilling\u201d. O primeiro \u00e9 sem modifica\u00e7\u00e3o e demonstrou que a \nelectroredu\u00e7\u00e3o do zinco ocorre de forma aleat\u00f3ria ao longo de todo o \ncomprimento do poro, o que leva ao fecho do poro e a um enchimento n\u00e3o \nhomog\u00e9neo. A segunda modifica\u00e7\u00e3o, cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o total por t\u00eampera, permite a \nprepara\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas coaxiais devido \u00e0 deposi\u00e7\u00e3o uniforme de zinco nas \nparedes dos poros. A \u00faltima modifica\u00e7\u00e3o foi a cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o selectiva do fundo \ndo poro. Foi descoberto que uma anodiza\u00e7\u00e3o adicional em eletr\u00f3litos n\u00e3o \nagressivos leva \u00e0 cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o da parte barreira dos tubos (fundo) e, \nconsequentemente, a maior condutividade na parte inferior do que nas paredes. \nEste efeito permite um enchimento ascendente dos modelos porosos de tit\u00e2nia. \nAs estrat\u00e9gias aqui apresentadas alargam a gama de possibilidades para a \naplica\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos porosos an\u00f3dicos na electrodeposi\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes \nnanoestruturas. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nelectrodeposition, barrier layer, deep eutectic solvent, porous template, anodic \ntitania, anodic alumina.  \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe template assisted method of 1-D nanoparticles synthesis has become a hot \ntopic in Chemistry after the development of high-ordered porous anodic films. \nMost studies in this field have focused on the use of detached porous films due \nto the presence of the barrier layer on the pore bottom. However, this strategy \nfollows a great number of steps, which raises its cost while decreasing \nconvenience of operation and imposing several limitations. Consequently, there \nis a need for a technique which allows electrofilling of tubes without removing the \nbarrier layer \u2013 this thesis represents our contribution to that enterprise. We have \ndevised a simpler technique which allows electrodeposition of nanostructures \ndirectly in the templates on metallic substrate, using choline chloride based deep \neutectic solvents (DES) as electrolyte. Compared to water, DES have improved \nthermal stability and a wider electrochemical window, dramatically increasing the \nnumber of possible secondary materials deposited. \nTitania and alumina were chosen as materials under study due to their known \ncapacity to form highly-ordered porous structures, different electrochemical \nprofiles and widespread use in template assisted synthesis. The present work is \ndivided in two parts. First, the influence of the barrier layer has been investigated \nby using dense barrier films on the electrode surface as a model system. For \nboth alumina and titania films, several parameters affecting the electrodeposition \nof zinc have been identified, notably the influence of the anodization voltage, \nbarrier layer thickness, electrical double layer and current profile. During this \nstage, some negative effects have been detected, such as a dense organic layer \nformation on electrode surface, a hurdle which has been overcome by either \nincreasing the temperature or applying the alternating potential. \nThe second stage consisted in transferring the method from the flat electrodes \n(the first stage) to the porous templates. The successful filling of both porous \nalumina and porous titania, has been achieved. Parameters such as current \nprofile, solution temperature, among others, have been tuned to improve the fill \nfactor and homogeneity of the filling. A two-step porous anodic alumina template \nfilling with AC nucleation (1st step) and galvanostatic filling (2nd step) has been \ndeveloped. Three different types of porous anodic titania templates have been \nused for electrofilling. The first one was used as-prepared, showing that zinc \nelectroreduction occurs in random places along all pore length, resulting in pore \nsealing and non-homogeneous filling. The second modification, full \ncrystallization by annealing, allows the preparation of coaxial structures due to \nuniform zinc deposition on the pore walls. The last modification is selective \nbottom crystallization. It has been found that additional anodization in \nunaggressive electrolytes leads to crystallization of the barrier (bottom) part of \nthe tubes and, thus, to higher conductivity of the bottom part than that of the \nwalls. This effect allows a bottom-up filling of the titania porous template. \nThe strategies presented here widen the range of possibilities for the application \nof porous anodic templates in the electrodeposition of different nanostructures. \n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\nxv \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nList of abbreviations ..................................................................................................... xvii \n\nList of figures ................................................................................................................ xix \n\nList of tables ................................................................................................................. xxv \n\nIntroduction ...................................................................................................................... 1 \n\nChapter I State of the art ................................................................................................... 5 \n\n1.

The main idea is to find a possible way of formation of nanorods \n\nby direct electrodeposition in porous non-detached oxide matrixes, avoiding expensive \n\nand time consuming steps such as substrate removal, pores opening and contact \n\nsputtering. The negative feature of the barrier layer on the pores bottoms is vanished by \n\ntemplates modification or by application of a specific current profile. \n\nThis PhD thesis reports a part of the work on the metal electrodeposition that has \n\nbeen performed during the last four years. For the template investigation, step-by-step \n\nanalysis has been used. Different approaches were used in order to achieve the \n\nhomogeneous pores electrofilling. Some of them either had a negative effect or resulted \n\nin no visible effect, while others were found to enhance the electrodeposition process.  \n\nThe work is divided into seven chapters. The first one demonstrates the state of \n\nthe art related to objects of the thesis and gives useful information concerning those \n\nsubjects. The second chapter provides information about the performed experimental \n\nwork and about the experimental techniques that were applied. Detailed description of \n\nthe procedures, which were used in this work, is presented in the corresponding individual \n\nchapters. \n\nThe core results are presented in chapters III-VI. These chapters are constituted \n\nby the published papers starting from the oldest to the newest. Chapters III and IV report \n\nthe investigation of the anodic alumina oxide. The chapter III describes the two-step \n\ntechnique of filling the anodic alumina pores with zinc. The importance of application of \n\nthe pulse nucleation step and the galvanostatic step is shown in detail. Chapter IV contains \n\nexperimental data on the influence of the alumina barrier layer on the electrochemical \n\nreduction processes. In this work, the impacts of several parameters such as film \n\nthickness, temperature of the solution, additional sinusoidal potential oscillation, have \n\nbeen demonstrated. An evidence of formation of a dense organic layer on the \n\nalumina/electrolyte interface which hindered the zinc reduction and a possible way to \n\navoid the obstacles caused by this layer are given in the chapter. \n\nResults presented in chapters V and VI correspond to studies carried out on anodic \n\ntitania. In the same way, initially, the planar anodic film on the titanium interface has \n\nbeen investigated in terms of influence of both the oxide film thickness and the \n\nanodization voltage on the nucleation processes and kinetics of zinc reduction (chapter \n\nV). Then, based on the results presented in the chapter V, several possible template \n\nmodifications were studied and successfully used for filling of the porous titania \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n4 \n\n \n\ntemplates. The modifications such as annealing and selective bottom crystallization are \n\ndescribed and characterized in the chapter VI. The chapter also gives a description of the \n\nfilling of the modified templates. The results reported in chapters III-VI have been \n\npublished in SCI peer reviewed journals in the area of Electrochemistry. \n\nThe last chapter (chapter VII) summarizes the general conclusions of the work \n\nand shows possible future activities in the area of anodic films and ionic liquids. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter I \n\nState of the art \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n7 \n\n \n\nThales, a Greek philosopher, discovered that if amber was rubbed with a woollen \n\nfabric it started to attract light items such as small pieces of wood, feathers and leaves. \n\nHe was among the first to develop electricity in VI B.C. century. Nevertheless, two \n\nthousand years after that, knowledge about the electricity was hardly progressed at all. A \n\nnew wave of studies in the field started in the beginning of XVII century. There was a \n\nconsiderable number of scientists who tried to explore the phenomenon. Particularly, Otto \n\nVon Guericke created the first electrical machine, Stephen Gray developed the conception \n\nof conductors and nonconductors, Pieter Van Musschenbroek discovered the principle of \n\nthe Leyden jar (the first capacitor). Only in 1746, an American philosopher and statesman \n\nBenjamin Franklin suggested the single-fluid theory of electricity. In 1775, after the work \n\nof Luigi Galvani, Alessandro Volta announced the construction of the voltaic pile, the \n\nfirst electric battery, which transforms chemical energy to electrical energy. The main \n\nlaws of electricity, such as Ampere law, that explained the nature of electric current, Ohm \n\nlaw, Faraday\u2019s law and many others, were developed during the next 50 years. The \n\ndecomposition process of a compound by electricity was named \u201celectrolysis\u201d by Faraday \n\nin 1833. Furthermore, he discovered the laws of electrochemical decomposition: \u201cthe \n\namount decomposed by an electrical current is proportional to the current flowing and to \n\nthe time during which it flows; and when an electrolyte, or a series of electrolytes, is \n\ndecomposed by an electric current, the components into which it is separated are always \n\nchemically equivalent\u201d. This moment can be considered the origin of Electrochemistry \n\n[1].  \n\n1. Valve metals \n\nApplication of anodic potential to a metallic electrode in water based electrolyte \n\ninitiates the oxygen evolution. There is an additional process, namely the oxide layer \n\nformation on all metals, even before reaching the oxygen evolution potential [2]. These \n\noxides can be divided into three groups. The first group is commonly formed on noble \n\nmetals such as platinum, gold, iridium, ruthenium etc. and all of them are highly \n\nconductive oxides. The oxide layers with semiconductor properties (on nickel, tungsten, \n\ntitanium, molybdenum etc.) belong to the second group. According to the same logic, the \n\nlast group consists of the oxides with insulator properties, such as oxides of the valve \n\nmetals: aluminium, tantalum, zirconium etc. The oxide layer formation is the main \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n8 \n\n \n\nreaction that takes place during anodic polarization of the third metals group (valve \n\nmetals) [2]. \n\nThere is a variety of factors that can influence formation of the oxide layer on the \n\nelectrode interface (so-called passivation), for example, metal nature, composition of the \n\nelectrolyte and electrochemical conditions. Alteration of these parameters (electrode \n\nmaterial, solution composition, potential and current density, temperature of the solution \n\netc.) will affect the electrochemical reaction on the anode.  \n\nFigure I. 1 shows the typical linear potential sweep curve from open circuit \n\npotential to anodic values. Initial potential growth leads to increasing of dissolution rate. \n\nHowever, after reaching the critical current, dissolution almost stops and further potential \n\ngrowth does not influence current significantly. The voltage with the highest current of \n\ndissolution is named a primary passivation potential, while the highest current is named \n\nthe critical corrosion current. The current will start rising sharply at more positive \n\npotential, named breakdown potential. The second current increase occurs because of \n\ndielectric, chemical or structural film breakdown accompanied by intense electrolyte \n\ndecomposition and dissolution of electrode material [2]. The stable region with a very \n\nlow current density is a passive region. The barrier layer forms at this potential range. It \n\nis similar to the chemical barrier layers, such as those grown on iron in concentrated nitric \n\nsolution or on aluminium in air, which block further reactions [2]. The biggest advantage \n\nof the valve metals is a high breakdown potential (wide passive region (Figure I. 1 dotted \n\nline)) which can be up to several hundred volts.  \n\n \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 1 The typical current/potential dependence of anodic polarization with \n\npassivation behaviour. \n\nIt is possible to obtain various processes by changing voltage that subsequently \n\nleads to different types of surfaces on the electrode. All of these regimes are actively used \n\nfor broad-ranging applications, for instance electropolishing [3, 4], metal passivation [5, \n\n6], plasma electrolytic oxidation [7-9], porous anodic template formation [10-12].  \n\n1.1 Dense anodic films \n\nAs it was mentioned before, the valve metals have a wide passive region. At this \n\npotential range oxide thickness grows as the voltage increases. It leads to thick film \n\nformation if there are no aggressive ions capable to dissolve oxide [2]. \n\nThe barrier anodic film forms via ions migration. As shown in Figure I. 2, metallic \n\ncation and oxygen anion migrate through the oxide layer in the opposite directions: from \n\nthe metal surface to the oxide/electrolyte interface and from electrolyte to the metal, \n\ncorrespondingly. Cations combine with anions and form metal oxide [5]. The anodic \n\nreaction is the following: \n\n \n\nM + zH2O - 2ze\n- ? MOz + 2zH+ (I.1) \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 2 Schematic representation of the barrier anodic film formation on a metal \n\nsurface. \n\nIdeally, the barrier layer is a non-porous oxide film both electrons and ions \n\nconductive, although ions move only at high electric field strength [13]. The barrier layers \n\nare commonly characterized by low electronic, but high ionic conductivity. It means that \n\nionic conductivity is predominant in this type of films and anodization will occur until \n\nthe ionic current flow stops. The different factors, such as the electric field strength, nature \n\nof the metal and metal oxide, influence the ionic current. It is also clear that the resulting \n\nfilm thickness depends on the relation between the electric field and the ionic current \n\ndensity [13]. This relation is named an anodization ratio (oxide thickness nanometres per \n\nvolt, nm V-1). The oxide film thickness can be approximately calculated by multiplying \n\nthe anodization ratio by the applied potential. Unfortunately, the anodization ratio \n\nstrongly depends on the electrode material, the solution composition, temperature, \n\napplied current etc. The typical anodizing ratios for different valve metals are present in \n\nTable I. 1. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n11 \n\n \n\nTable I. 1 Properties of several oxide/metal systems. \n\nSystem \nAnodization \n\nratio (nm V-1) \n\nDensity  \n\n(g cm-3) \n\nDielectric \n\nconstant \n\nAl/Al2O3 \n\nTi/TiO2 \n\nZr/ZrO2 \n\nTa/Ta2O5 \n\n1.3-1.4 [5] \n\n2-3 [14-18] \n\n2.7-3.0 [19] \n\n1.6 [20] \n\n3.1 \n\n3.9 \n\n5.7 \n\n8.5 \n\n9 [21] \n\n57 [17, 18] \n\n27 [22] \n\n21 [20] \n\n1.1.1 Anodic alumina film \n\nThe history of the dense anodic film on aluminium has started more than 100 years \n\nago. Over the course of decades aluminium and aluminium alloys attract a lot of attention \n\ndue to the surface barrier layer. The layer protects the main metallic part from corrosion. \n\nIt was found that the Al and Al-based alloys have a better corrosion resistance than that \n\nof iron and steels. Moreover, such property of the aluminium alloys as low density, makes \n\nit attractive for aircraft industry. After development of chemical- and electropolishing, \n\naluminium surfaced are intensively used as reflectors. Additionally, a possibility to \n\nprepare anodic alumina films with different colours opens a wide prospect for its \n\napplication in decoration. Since recently, anodic alumina films are intensively studied for \n\ncreation metal-insulator-metal and metal-insulator-semiconductor devices, which can be \n\nused as sub-wavelength plasmonic waveguides [23, 24] and supercapacitors [25, 26]. \n\nApplication of a positive potential to the aluminium electrode in a suitable, i.e. \n\naggressive ions free, electrolyte such as ammonium pentaborate and ammonium citrate, \n\nleads to formation of compact and adherent film of the anodic alumina on the electrode \n\ninterface according to the aforementioned general mechanism. After formation of the \n\noxide monolayer, the oxidation should stop because of insulator properties of the alumina. \n\nNevertheless, the barrier layer continue growing owing to ions migration in the high \n\nelectric field. Obviously, continuous growth of the oxide requires continuous voltage \n\nincreasing, otherwise the film becomes too thick and the anodic current flow stops [5]. \n\nThe typical I(t) curve for barrier layer formation at constant potential is presented in \n\nFigure I. 3.  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 3 Typical current \u2013 time transient obtained at constant potential for barrier \n\nlayer formation. \n\nAs it was specified in Table I. 1, the anodization ratio for alumina is about 1.4 nm \n\nV-1, which matches to the high electric field, values higher than 7x106 V cm-1 [27]. The \n\nthickness of the barrier layer can reach 0.7 \u00b5m at voltage of about 500 V [28]. \n\nUnfortunately, higher voltage is problematic to achieve because of electrical breakdown \n\nof a film. \n\nThe structure of the obtained film depends on temperature, applied voltage, \n\nsolution composition etc. [13] The electron diffraction study has been done by Harrington \n\nand Nelson [29] for anodic alumina film formed at different electrolytes. The results \n\nshowed that films are amorphous. The influence of temperature was investigated by \n\nseveral researchers. Firstly, it was reported by Taylor et al. [30] in 1945 that films remain \n\namorphous independently on the electrolyte used up 100 V of anodization. Application \n\nof a higher voltage leads to formation of ?-Al2O3 phase detected by XRD. 15 years later, \n\nsimilar conclusions were made by Stirland and Bicknell [31]. They used the electron \n\ndiffraction for the film examination. The authors found that at a voltage below 100 V the \n\nbarrier film is absolutely amorphous. The films prepared at a voltage above 100 V \n\nremained mostly amorphous, but some ?-alumina phase was also detected. \n\nComposition of the barrier layer depends on the electrolyte used because of the \n\nanions incorporation. In conformity with the ions nature, Thompson et al. [32, 33] divided \n\nall anions in three groups: \n\n? mobile inwards (phosphate, sulfate); \n\n? immobile (borate, silicate); \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n13 \n\n \n\n? mobile outwards (tungstate, molybdate); \n\nThe ions from the first group incorporate into the layer and migrate inside the film \n\nunder electric field because of their negative charge. The immobile species are adsorbed \n\non the electrode surface and afterwards they incorporate into the film as oxide (B2O3 and \n\nSiO2). The species from the third group move from the inner part of the oxide to the \n\nalumina/electrolyte interface. This tendency can be explained by anions oxidation to \n\ncations during anodization with subsequent cations movement in the same direction with \n\nAl3+ under the influence of electric field [32]. Thompson et al. [32] obtained the \n\nincorporation level of the electrolyte species in the range of 0.6 \u2013 5.5 at%. Moreover, the \n\namount of incorporated ions also depends on the anodization voltage and the electrolyte \n\ntemperature. It was shown by Mason [34] that at higher current density and lower solution \n\ntemperature the anodic film was richer in extra species. The same behavior was found for \n\nbarrier film on tantalum and niobium [35]. The preparation of a relatively pure anodic \n\nalumina layer is described by Skeldon et al. [36]. The authors used potassium hydroxide \n\nsolution as electrolyte. Since the only OH- anions were present, the obtained film was free \n\nof additional elements.  \n\nAlthough in some cases, the water incorporation during the film formation can be \n\ndetected, but nonporous films are generally observed to be anhydrous. The amount of \n\nincorporated water is determined by the formation conditions. Furthermore, no water is \n\nincorporated in a free form, commonly it is hydroxide or hydrated oxide [13].  \n\n1.1.2 Anodic titania film \n\nTitanium standard potential value is almost equal to that of aluminium: -1.63 V \n\nand -1.66 V for Ti/Ti2+ and Al/Al3+, correspondingly. Thereby, Ti is a very active metal, \n\nalthough shows typical properties of the valve metals. Titanium does not corrode in air \n\nonly due to thin oxide film on the interface which forms immediately after a contact with \n\noxygen. The titanium dioxide films have distinguished properties, namely catalytic and \n\nphotocatalytic [37, 38], self-cleaning and wetting [39]. The TiO2 films find use in solar \n\ncells [40] and optical devices [41]. \n\nGenerally, anodic titania and alumina are resembling materials, for example, the \n\nmechanism of the titania formation is comparable to that of alumina and other barrier \n\nfilms. At the same time, alumina is an insulator as, while titania is a n-type semiconductor \n\nwith a comparatively high electronic conductivity. Therefore, there are two reactions that \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n14 \n\n \n\nsimultaneously. The first, titanium oxidation, occurs with ionic current under high electric \n\nfield and is responsible for the film growth: \n\nTi + 2H2O ?TiO2 + 4H\n+ + 4e- (I.2) \n\nThe second one is the oxygen oxidation on the barrier/electrolyte interface \n\n(electronic current) and does not contribute to the film growth [42]. \n\nThe number of possible electrolytes applicable for the titania film formation is \n\nmuch bigger than those available for alumina preparation because of titania insensitivity \n\nto different aggressive ions. Hwang and Hwang [43] have studied kinetics of the titanium \n\nanodization in a 0.5M sulfuric acid. The authors applied atomic absorption spectroscopy \n\nfor calculation of the titanium concentration in the solution after anodization and \n\nconcluded that the dissolution rate is exiguous. There are series of publications reporting \n\non successful preparation of thin titania layers in sulfuric acid with different \n\nconcentrations [18, 44, 45], phosphoric acid [44, 46], sodium hydroxide [45] etc. During \n\nthe film formation the electrolyte anions migrate inside the titania film in the same manner \n\nas described above for the case of aluminium anodization. Moreover, the nature and \n\nconcentration of the solution affect not only the final composition of the titania layer, but \n\nalso the oxide growth behaviours. Sul et al. [47] investigated properties of anodic oxide \n\nlayer as function of current density, the electrolyte compositions and concentrations, and \n\ntemperature. All of these parameters have a significant influence on anodic formation \n\nfactor, current efficiency, anodic forming voltage and oxide forming rate. Moreover, the \n\nformation rate was found to have a strong impact on surface properties of the layer. \n\nBlackwood et al. [48] found that a higher formation rate results in a higher defect \n\nconcentration. The dielectric constant is also affected by the growth rate. \n\nThe regime of film preparation influences the crystallinity of the film. There are \n\nthree main characteristics determining the film crystallinity, namely temperature, current \n\nand voltage. The crystalline state of an anodic oxide film on titanium was found to be \n\ndependent on the formation potential and the electrolyte temperature (Shibata and Zhu \n\n[49]). Film crystallization occurs at potentials that are more positive than 7.0 V or at \n\ntemperatures above 333 K. Ohtsuka et al. also confirmed that at some critical voltage, \n\namorphous titania transforms to crystalline anatase phase [50]. Furthermore, the solution \n\nconcentration is critical for the titania crystal structure. Diamanti and Pedeferri [51] \n\ninvestigated the influence of oxidation parameters on the anodic titanium dioxide layer. \n\nThe authors have demonstrated that at higher potential titania became more crystalline as \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n15 \n\n \n\nit was also shown in Shibata and Ohtsuka works. Moreover, a film growth at lower current \n\ndensity and/or at lower concentration of the electrolyte results in a smaller fraction of \n\nanatase in the oxide.  \n\n1.2 Porous anodic templates \n\nIn the electrolytes that contain aggressive ions, porous oxide film and not only \n\ndense barrier layers form (Figure I. 4). The ions considered as aggressive are different for \n\ndifferent metals. For instance, porous alumina film can be easily prepared in oxalic, \n\nsulphuric, phosphoric and tartaric acids containing solutions. However, most of the valve \n\nmetals demand the presence of the fluoride anions in the electrolyte. Oxidation of \n\ntitanium, zirconium, hafnium, tungsten, thallium, vanadium and even iron in the \n\nappropriate electrolytes is accompanied with formation of porous oxide layers. Moreover, \n\noptimization of the anodization conditions such as electrolyte composition, voltage, \n\ntemperature, results in formation of ordered pores, which are arranged perpendicularly to \n\nthe substrate (Figure I. 4).  \n\n \n\nFigure I. 4 Valve metals electrooxidation, depending on solution composition, occurs \n\nwith formation of dense barrier or porous anodic film. \n\nThe porous anodic templates on transition metals have ubiquitous applications due \n\nto the electronic, chemical and optical properties. For example, ZrO2, WO3, Al2O3, Ta2O5, \n\nTiO2 etc. have promising properties, which allow them to be used in many application \n\nsuch as solar energy conversion [52, 53], energy [54] and data [55] storage, as well as in \n\noptical [55, 56], photocatalytic [57-60], biomedical [59], and electrochromic devices [61, \n\n62]. Moreover, titania shows perfect biocompatibility. This characteristic promotes the \n\nuse of titania in medical technologies, such as in orthopedics and dentistry.  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n16 \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Porous anodic alumina \n\nPorous anodic alumina has been known since 1953 [63], but it was given a due \n\nconsideration only in 1995, after development of highly ordered hexagonal pore \n\nstructures by Masuda et al. [64]. This material is under active investigation during last \n\ndecades as template or host system for formation of nanostructures such as nanorods, \n\nnanowires, nanodots, nanotubes etc. \n\nThe porous anodic alumina (PAA) is mainly synthesized in acid base electrolyte \n\n[55] with pH lower than 5. Low pH is one of the most crucial factors necessary for \n\ndissolution of the alumina and formation of a porous structure. Different acids and \n\nmixtures of acids can be used. Some possible electrolytes as well as the anodization \n\nconditions are presented in Table I. 2 (based on Chu\u2019s et al. work [65]).  \n\nTable I. 2 Examples of electrolytes and anodization conditions for PAA preparation. \n\nElectrolyte Concentration Voltage (V) Temperature (K) Interpore \n\ndistance (nm) \n\nOxalic \n\n \n\n0.5 wt% \n\n0.25 wt% \n\n100 \n\n160 \n\n276 \n\n274 \n\n220 \n\n440 \n\nPhosphoric \n\n \n\n2.5 vol% \n\n1 vol% \n\n195 \n\n235 \n\n273 \n\n273 \n\n420 \n\n480 \n\nSulfuric 10 vol% 70 273 130 \n\nTartaric 2 wt% 235 278 600 \n\nMalic \n\n \n\n4 wt% \n\n2 wt% \n\n220 \n\n450 \n\n283 \n\n283 \n\n550 \n\n950 \n\nCitric \n\n \n\n4 wt% \n\n2 wt% \n\n270 \n\n370 \n\n293 \n\n293 \n\n650 \n\n980 \n\nGlycolic \n\n \n\n10 wt% \n\n1 wt% \n\n50 \n\n150 \n\n283 \n\n283 \n\n150 \n\n320 \n\n \n\nResults of the Chu\u2019s et al. work clearly showed ample opportunities of the PAA \n\nuse as a template due to wide ranges of interpore distance, pore diameter and pore density \n\n[55] (from 108 to 1012 pores cm-2). Three most common conditions used for PAA \n\npreparation are the following: sulfuric acid at 25 V [66], oxalic acid at 40 V [64] and \n\nphosphoric acid at 195 V [67, 68]. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n17 \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the pore diameter can be tuned by immersion of the template in acid \n\nelectrolytes without application of any potential. It leads to dissolution of the alumina and \n\nconsequently to pores widening. The typical SEM images of the anodic alumina oxide \n\nafter pore widening are shown in Figure I. 5. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 5 Typical porous alumina templates prepared in a 3M oxalic acid at 40 V \n\n(a) and in a 8 wt% phosphoric acid at 152 V (b) after pore widening in the same \n\nanodization electrolytes at 40oC for 2.5 and 0.5 h correspondingly. \n\nThe growth mechanism of the self-organized alumina nanopores is still largely \n\nunknown. Electrochemical reactions are the same for both porous and dense anodic films \n\nformation, but chemical dissolution takes place only during porous film preparation. The \n\ncathode reaction is a hydrogen evolution:  \n\n2H+ + 2e- ? H2 (I.3) \n\n2H2O + 2e\n- ? H2 + 2OH\n\n- (I.4) \n\nReactions on the anode should be divided in two groups: \n\n? electrochemical oxidation (at the metal/oxide interface): \n\nAl0 \u2013 3e- ? Al3+ (I.5) \n\n2Al0 + 6OH- ?

Up to date, the most acknowledged mechanisms of ordering are based on \n\nmechanical stress and field assisted dissolution [69-72]. The pore growth can be separated \n\nin four successive steps: \n\n? formation of the compact oxide; \n\n? random chemical etching; \n\n? pores nucleation; \n\n? pores growth in steady-state conditions; \n\nAll the steps reflect to the current time transient which is schematically \n\nrepresented on Figure I. 6 and described by Parkhutik [73].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 6 Typical current time transient obtained during aluminium anodization \n\nin acid electrolyte (adapted from Parkhutik [73]). \n\nAt the beginning of anodization (zone I), the aluminium surface is being covered \n\nby dense alumina. Since this bulk alumina film is insulator, it provides fast decreasing of \n\nthe current density. In zone I, the current time transient has the same shape as that of a \n\ntransient when anodizing in a neutral electrolyte. The barrier layer is uniform in large \n\nscale and the electric field is constant at the whole sample surface at that moment as \n\nshown in Figure I. 7 a [74]. The next stage is possible only in aggressive electrolyte and \n\ncharacterized by increase of the current density (Figure I. 6, zone II). During this stage, \n\nsome pits occur on the oxide surface due to random chemical etching, stress after the \n\noxide formation, impurities etc. In these places, alumina layer is thinner than in the rest \n\nof the film and it results in lower resistance of the film and consequently in higher local \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n19 \n\n \n\ncurrent. Moreover, the electric field is stronger in vicinity of the irregularities of the \n\nsurface. As a result, chemical dissolution, superimposed by field-enhanced dissolution, is \n\nfaster in these pits than in the bulk oxide (Figure I. 7 b). However, not all the surface \n\nconcavities will transform into pores, since some of them will close with time and the \n\npore formation will stop. This process corresponds to the small current drop in the zone \n\nIII (Figure I. 6). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 7 Schematic representation of the alumina pore formation by anodization: \n\n(a) formation of the planar layer with a uniform thickness; (b) onset of surface \n\nirregularities that change the field distribution in the layer; (c) initiation of the pore \n\ngrowing; (d) pore growing at steady-state conditions; (e) pores self-ordering \n\n(adapted from Su et al. [74]). \n\nAfter the first three stages, the surface is stable and pores grow in a steady-state \n\ncondition. The zone IV corresponds to the stable growth and is characterized by constant \n\ncurrent density (Figure I. 6). Physically, at this stage, oxidation of the aluminium and \n\ndissolution of the alumina occur simultaneously, but dissolution of the pore wall is slower \n\nthan that of the bottom barrier, where a stronger electrical field enhances the process \n\n(Figure I. 7 c, d). This difference in the rates of dissolution leads to pore formation. \n\nDuration of the pore growth depends on several factors such as type and concentration of \n\nthe electrolyte, voltage, temperature and stirring. At the point, when the rate of chemical \n\ndissolution of the alumina will be the same as the oxidation rate, the thickness of the \n\nporous layer is kept constant. This point corresponds to maximal thickness of the template \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n20 \n\n \n\n(it is possible to have thickness higher than 50 \u00b5m). All the above described stages were \n\nobserved directly and confirmed by Thompson et al. with the use of TEM [71]. \n\nPractically, the pores density is high and it could strongly affect the neighbour \n\npores (Figure I. 7 e). According to mechanical stress model [68-70, 74], volume of the \n\nanodic alumina is twice bigger than volume of aluminium which was used for \n\nanodization. Consequently, the mechanical stresses appear in the oxide/metal interface \n\nowing to volume enlargement. Repulsive forces between the boundary pores determine \n\nself-organization in hexagonal structure. \n\nIn principle, ordered anodic alumina template can be manufactured using a single \n\nstep anodization, but it is hardly achievable because of the random pore initiation. In \n\n1995, Masuda and Fukuda introduced the two-step anodization approach [64] \n\nschematically represented in Figure I. 8. \n\n \n\nFigure I. 8 Schematic representation of the two-step anodization. \n\nThe first anodization is normally performed continuously during several hours. \n\nThis step consists on formation of highly ordered pores structure at the metal/oxide \n\ninterface and the aluminium surface texturing with a long-range order of dimples. \n\nNevertheless, the upper part of the obtained porous oxide layer is irregular. After the first \n\nanodization, the electrode is immersed in a solution which dissolves the anodic alumina \n\nwithout any reaction with aluminium substrate. Commonly, solution of chromium (VI) \n\noxide in phosphoric acid is used for this aim [75, 76]. The alumina dissolution leads to \n\nremoval of the irregular porous layer and revealing of the periodically arranged dimples \n\non the aluminium surface. The second step is normally carried out at the same conditions \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n21 \n\n \n\nas the first one. These ordered dimples form the initiation sites for growth of new pores. \n\nIt excludes any random distribution of pores at the pore nucleation step and the new \n\nstructure has long range order over the whole length of the pores [76-78]. \n\nAlternatively, pre-textured aluminium surface with controllable interpore distance \n\ncan be manufactured by several techniques, such as mechanical imprinting [79-81], \n\nfocused-ion-beam lithography [82-84], holographic lithography[85]. The key benefit of \n\nall these techniques is a single step process, which saves time and makes parameters of \n\nthe template fully controllable. Unfortunately, the equipment for the aluminium surface \n\npre-texturing is sophisticated and expensive.  \n\nThere are several important points to be mentioned regarding the pore ordering. \n\nOne can see, irregularities in pores structure are mainly concentrated in vicinities of the \n\naluminium grain boundaries. Therefore, aluminium is annealed at near melting point \n\ntemperature (500-600oC) for several hours in order to increase the grain size and decrease \n\nthe grains boundary thereby decreasing the amount of irregularities. Moreover, the purity \n\nof aluminium plays an important role because impurities lead to deviation in volume \n\nexpansion of the oxide and, as a result, the disordering of the pores occurs. Furthermore, \n\nas it was shown before (on example of dimples), the surface roughness affects the pore \n\nordering. Consequently, the surface smoothening is preferred and typically performed by \n\nmeans of electropolishing in mixture of the perchloric acid and ethanol [86, 87]. \n\n1.2.2 Porous anodic titania \n\nPreparation of porous anodic titania has firstly reported by Zwilling et al. in 1999 \n\n[88]. Using a chromic acid electrolytes with hydrofluoric acid, a porous film of about 0.5 \n\n\u00b5m thick was obtained. The Zwilling et al. work shows the importance of the fluoride \n\nions presence in the electrolyte for manufacturing of the porous layer. In the following \n\nyears, several electrolytes for PAT preparation were used, such as the water based ones \n\nwith sulphate [89], phosphate [90, 91], acetate [92] ions or in organic electrolytes [93] \n\nwhich were based on glycerol [94], ionic liquids [95], dimethyl sulfoxide [96]. In all the \n\nmentioned cases, the electrolytes contained also fluoride ions. Based on those studies, \n\nseveral dependences were found. Macak et al. [89] showed that at neutral pH, the \n\nmaximal film thickness is about 2.5 \u00b5m while it is ?1 \u00b5m [91] when preparing in acid \n\nelectrolyte. Anodization in organic based electrolyte such as ethylene glycol [97, 98] \n\nresults in formation of high-ordered and long (more than 250 \u00b5m [98]) tubes with smooth \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n22 \n\n \n\nwalls, in contrast to the situation with water based electrolyte, where sidewall ripples were \n\nfound. Furthermore, the two-step technique was used for preparation of high-ordered \n\ntitania tubes in the same manner as described above for the case of porous anodic alumina \n\n[99].  \n\nThe self-ordering and pore formation mechanism of both the porous anodic titania \n\nand the porous anodic alumina are similar. Initially, the dense barrier layer is formed on \n\nthe electrode interface, then the pores nucleate randomly on the pits and defects followed \n\nby steady-state pore growth. The similarity of the current time transient and the steps \n\nduring PAT preparation with aluminium oxidation (Figure I. 6) was proved in several \n\nworks [100, 101]. Moreover, SEM studies confirmed that the main steps of PAT \n\npreparation and PAA preparation are the same.  \n\nDespite the obvious resemblance of the anodization of aluminium and titanium, \n\nthere are some critical distinctions. The reaction on cathode is the same: \n\n2H+ + 2e- ? H2 (I.8) \n\n2H2O + 2e\n- ? H2 + 2OH\n\n- (I.9) \n\nAnodic oxidation of titanium occurs by a general mechanism for all valve metals: \n\nTi + 2H2O ? TiO2 + 4H\n+ + 4e- (I.10) \n\nHowever, the pore formation is impossible without dissolution of the oxide, that \n\nis why fluoride ions are added to solution. Titanium ions form soluble complexes with F- \n\nand then these species go to the electrolyte. There are two possible ways of the \n\ncomplexation: \n\n? chemical dissolution of the titanium dioxide; \n\nTiO2 + 6F\n- + 4H+ ? [TiF6]\n\n2- + 2H2O  (I.11) \n\n? direct complexation of the Ti4+ cations on the electrode/electrolyte interface \n\nTi4+ + 6F- ? [TiF6]\n2- (I.12) \n\nThe pores formation occurs as a result of competition between anodic oxide \n\nformation and oxide dissolution [53] in which the fluoride ions concentration plays an \n\nimportant role. The compact layer only forms at the very low concentration of F- (lower \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n23 \n\n \n\nthan 0.05% (wt.)). When concentration of fluoride ions is higher than 1% (wt.), the \n\nelectropolishing happens due to solubility of the [TiF6]\n2- species. Therefore, formation of \n\nthe porous titania layer is only possible at the moderate concentration of the fluorides \n\n[102, 103]. \n\nOne more distinction between titania and alumina films is the microstructure \n\nstructure. Ordered anodic titania structure is often called tubes and not pores. However, \n\nthe tubes near the bottom are compact and have hexagonal organization which is very \n\nsimilar to the pores arrangement in anodic alumina. One can see, that the tubes formation \n\nfrom the pores during anodization [99, 102] cannot be explained by a standard \n\nmechanism. The important step for understanding the difference between PAA and PAT \n\nwas the development of multi-layer structure of a titania pore [104-107]. Schematic \n\nrepresentation of the pore configuration is shown in Figure I. 9. Albu et al. [105] have \n\nfound three main layers in a pore: \n\n? outer shell of the tube (OST) mainly formed by TiO2 with a small amount of F\n-. \n\n? inner shell of the tube (IST) formed by titanium oxide and hydroxide and \n\ncontaining the electrolyte components. \n\n? fluoride-rich layer (FLR) formed by TiO2 with a considerable amount of F\n-. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 9 Schematic representation of a titanium pore structure with outer (OST) \n\nand inner (IST) oxide shell and a fluoride-rich layer (FRL); a) ideal condition \n\nwithout layer dissolution and b) real condition (adapted from Albu et al. [105]). \n\nThe IST layer is crumbly in comparison to the dense OST one and the IST layer \n\nis dissolved in electrolyte much easier and faster. Dissolution of the inner shell is \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n24 \n\n \n\nresponsible for formation of a common V-shape of the tube [99, 104-107]. On the other \n\nhand, the OST layer has almost constant thickness along the whole pore length [105]. \n\nThere is a number of works where the fluoride-rich layer was described as a very thin \n\nfilm on the border between titanium substrate and outer shell. The presence of this region \n\nis in agreement with the anodization mechanism. In high electric field, the negative ions, \n\nsuch as O2-, OH-, F-, move through the oxide until the metal interface where they react \n\nwith the substrate. Fluoride ion is very small and its migration occurs much faster than \n\noxygen or hydroxide ions, which results in formation of a fluoride-rich layer on the \n\nmetal/oxide interface. The thin layer (FRL) moves from the bottom to the tube walls \n\naccording to the flow concept introduced by Hebert et al. [108]. The model shows that \n\nthe viscous titania drifts up the pore walls induced by the forces which are originated by \n\ncompressive stress and ionic movement. This titania flowing leads to growth of the tubes \n\n(Figure I. 9 a). It should be also mentioned that, in a real condition, all electrolytes contain \n\nwater and it is mandatory for the titanium oxidation. The water dissolves the IST layer \n\ntogether with FLR and exactly because of the solubility of FLR the tube structure forms \n\n(Figure I. 9 b). Furthermore, Berger et al. [107] studied the influence of water in ethylene \n\nglycol electrolyte on the growth of the TiO2 tubes. It was confirmed that at low water \n\nquantity, the dissolution of the fluoride-rich region is limited and tubes have cylindrical \n\nshape. In contrast, tapered tubes form when quantity of water is too high. \n\nAs-formed titania tubes are commonly amorphous [109]; a nanocrystaline anatase \n\nphase was detected in the tubes after anodization at relatively high voltage [94]. \n\nCrystalline state strongly affects properties of the titania layer, such as conductivity [109], \n\nphotoresponse etc. For this reason, a considerable work was performed to investigate \n\ncrystallization of titania films. Anatase and rutile are two main phases which can be \n\nobtained by annealing under oxidation condition (air or oxygen atmosphere) [89, 105, \n\n110]. Crystallization of amorphous titania into anatase begins at relatively low \n\ntemperature (250oC) [94, 109, 111]. Increase of temperature up to 450oC results in higher \n\nconcentration of anatase phase. Moreover, annealing at 250oC for a longer time (up to 20 \n\nh) also leads to a significant increase of the anatase fraction [109]. At temperature above \n\n450oC, the rutile phase is also detected in the layer [109] and at 900oC, titania is \n\ncompletely converted to rutile [102].  \n\nApart from crystalline state and crystal structure, annealing can affect composition \n\nof oxide film. Thus, reduction of the Ti4+ species to Ti3+, which occurs when annealing \n\nin inert atmosphere (e.g. in Ar), impacts the conductivity of film. Additionally, it is well-\n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n25 \n\n \n\nknown that as-prepared nanotubes contain different species from electrolyte, such as \n\nhydroxide, fluoride, phosphate, carbon etc. These species can be also removed by \n\nannealing [105, 110]. \n\nApplication of the TiO2 nanostructures is commonly based on some unique \n\nbehaviours of titania such as electronic, ionic and biocompatible. Moreover, the large \n\nsurface area is an important factor as well [102]. For example, biocompatibility of the \n\ntitanium and titanium based alloys allows wide application of these materials as implants. \n\nThe implant surface is independent from the shape and it can be covered by anodic film \n\nwith different tube sizes. It helps to use the best condition for the cell adhesion [112]. \n\nMoreover, the fast hydroxyapatite formation on the pores surface attracts a lot of attention \n\nin bone implants [59]. Semiconducting properties of titania nanosructures films found \n\napplications in photocatalytic [113, 114] and solar cells devices [115, 116].  \n\n1.2.3 Preparation of 1-D nanoparticles through template \n\nassisted electrodeposition \n\nTemplates assisted electrodeposition is well-priced and one of the most \n\nconvenient technique for 1-D nanoparticles preparation. There is a variety of systems \n\nused for this aim, for instance Si/SiO2 [117-119], polymer matrix [120, 121]. \n\nNevertheless, most of the studies in the area were focused on the porous anodic templates \n\ndue to simplicity of both preparation and parameters control. Unfortunately, their \n\napplication templates for electrosynthesis requires additional modifications. \n\nA disadvantage of application of porous anodic templates arises from the presence \n\nof a barrier layer at the bottom of pores. Commonly, the oxide film, formed as a result of \n\nanodization or immediate oxidation of valve metals, acts as a high resistive medium \n\nimpairing the flow of current. One typical and frequently used template with this kind of \n\nproblem is anodic aluminium oxide.  \n\nNowadays, several approaches are actively used to solve the problem. The first, \n\nand probably the most common one, is the use of detached porous film. A multi-stage \n\nprocess of removal of both substrate and the barrier layer followed by contact deposition \n\nis typically applied [122]. In the first stage, a comparatively thick PAA layer is grown on \n\nthe aluminium foil (Figure I. 10 a). Then, metallic aluminium (substrate) is removed by \n\nchemical etching in solution of HgCl2  [123], CuCl2 + HCl [124] or SnCl4  [125] (Figure \n\nI. 10 b). Nonetheless, after the substrate is removed, the pores are still closed in one side. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n26 \n\n \n\nPores opening is commonly carried out in a diluted acidic or basic solution (Figure I. 10 \n\nc). The last step is metallization of the one side of the membrane. It can be performed by \n\nevaporation [123-125], filtration [126] or some other techniques (Figure I. 10 d). The \n\nresult of these procedures is the highly-ordered matrix with insulating walls and \n\nconducting bottom. The free-standing membranes were successfully used for preparation \n\nof different metallic [125, 127], semiconductor [128, 129], multilayer [130] 1-D \n\nnanoparticles and nanowires via electrodeposition.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 10 Schematic representation of the free-standing PAA template \n\npreparation. a) preparation of the PAA template; b) dissolution of the substrate; c) \n\npores opening; d) contact evaporation. \n\nAnother technique is a deposition in the non-detached PAA film after barrier \n\ncracking or thinning. The barrier modification is performed by decreasing of the voltage \n\nat the end of anodization or/and chemical etching [131, 132]. The thickness of the barrier \n\nlayer is proportional to the applied voltage. Hence, a decrease of the potential at the end \n\nof anodization leads to a decrease of the barrier layer thickness. Thus, electrodeposition \n\noccurs much easier in the modified template. However, there are no techniques that can \n\nremove absolutely the alumina layer due to immediate formation of the oxide layer on \n\naluminium at ambient conditions. Hence, it is necessary to use AC regime and \n\ncomparatively high voltage (10-20 V) for deposition [133].  \n\nIn spite of the fact that titania barrier layer is conductive, far less works on \n\nelectrodeposition in PAT template are available today. Because of the biggest weakness \n\nof the PAT, namely conductive walls, electrodeposition occurs in the whole pore surface \n\nand the pores are sealed on the top [134, 135]. In general, the approaches for \n\nelectrodeposition inside the titania nanotubes are similar to the previously showed for \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n27 \n\n \n\nalumina: AC (pulse) electrodeposition [136, 137], electrodeposition in detached template \n\n[138] and bottom modification. Bottom modification of PAT is different from that \n\napplicable for PAA and based on improving the barrier conductivity without changing \n\nthe walls. One of the most considerable and interesting work in the area was performed \n\nby Macak et al [139]. The authors increased conductivity of the bottom part of the tubes \n\nvia proton intercalation (Ti4+ + e- + H+ = Ti3+H+). In this way, successful bottom-up filling \n\nof the PAT with copper from a water-based solution was achieved. \n\n2. Ionic liquids and DES \n\nElectroplating was used for the first time in XIX century to deposit thin gold \n\ncoatings on various jewellery and decorative products. Nowadays, electrodeposition \n\ngains widespread use in all areas of industry, for example, electronics [140], corrosion \n\nprotection[141], metal production. Electrodeposition is considered as a cheap and \n\nappropriate method for preparation of coatings with diverse thicknesses, compositions for \n\nvariety of applications [142]. Unfortunately, electrodeposition from the most classical \n\nand generally available solvent, water, often requires the use of toxic components in \n\nsolution. In addition, it can be followed by undesirable extra processes (hydrogen \n\nreduction provokes the loss of efficiency and, what is more important, it could lead to \n\nhydrogen embrittlement). Varied media for deposition, such as organic solvents, eutectic \n\nmixture and ionic liquids, have been investigated as methods to avoid these secondary \n\nprocesses [2]. \n\nThe main driving force to study electrochemistry of non-aqueous solutions is the \n\nelectrodeposition of certain metals such as titanium, aluminium and tungsten. These \n\nmetals are well-known as materials with excellent corrosion resistance because of the thin \n\noxide layer formed in the ambient conditions. It was observed that the layer is very stable \n\nand prevents corrosion. On the other hand, the same factor (oxide layer formation) makes \n\nthe electrodeposition of these metals from aqueous media impossible. Organic solvents \n\nand melting salts are not suitable for common applications because of high volatility, \n\ntoxicity, flammable and high power consumption.  \n\nIonic liquid is a good compromise between organic solvents and melting salts. A \n\ntypical definition of an ionic liquid is \u201clow-melting salts (melting-point typically&lt;100oC) \n\nobtained by the combination of large organic cations with a variety of anions\u201d [143]. \n\nUsually, ionic materials have a high lattice energy and their melting temperature is high. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n28 \n\n \n\nIn general, one part of the ionic liquids is a big organic ion where the charge is \n\ndelocalized. It allows to decrease the lattice energy and to have liquid ionic materials at \n\nroom temperature [144].

This electrolyte contains two \n\ncomponents: the Lewis acid (most commonly AlCl3 or AlBr3) and a 1,3-\n\ndialkylimidazolium, alkylpyridinium or quaternary ammonium compound. The most \n\ncommon method for synthesis of this type of ionic liquids is a solid state reaction by \n\nmixing the components under active stirring. The preparation should be performed under \n\ninert atmosphere by using Schlenk techniques or glove box.  \n\nMixing of a quaternary halide salt where the cation is typically an amine, \n\nphosphine or sulfide (Cat+Hal-) with a Lewis acid (MeHalx) leads to formation of the  \n\n(Cat+MeHal-x+1) salt. The most frequently used quaternary salt is 1-ethyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM]Cl) and the Lewis acid is AlCl3. Unfortunately, \n\ncomposition of the final electrolyte is rather uncertain because it has a strong dependence \n\non the ratio organic salt : Lewis acid and on temperature [145]. Reactions that occur \n\nduring the ILs synthesis are the following: \n\n[EMIM]+Cl- + AlCl3 ? [EMIM]\n+[AlCl4]\n\n- (I.13) \n\n[EMIM]+[AlCl4]\n-  + AlCl3 ? [EMIM]\n\n+[Al2Cl7]\n- (I.14) \n\n[EMIM]+[Al2Cl7]\n- + AlCl3 ? [EMIM]\n\n+[Al3Cl10]\n- (I.15) \n\nThe ionic liquids can be also divided into three groups according to their acidity \n\nby analogy with water. Autosolvolysis of water can be described as: \n\n2H2O ? H3O\n+ + OH- (I.16) \n\nIn the same manner autosolvolysis reaction of [AlCl4]\n- species can be written as: \n\n2[AlCl4]\n- ? [Al2Cl7]\n\n- + Cl- (I.17) \n\nThe Lewis acidity/basicity can be easily changed by means of variation of the ratio \n\nbetween [EMIM]Cl and AlCl3, because Cl\n- is a typical Lewis base and [Al2Cl7]\n\n- is a Lewis \n\nacid (in water, these are OH- and H+, respectively). For the foregoing reasons, the three \n\ngroups of the ionic liquids are:  \n\n \n\n1) Acidic (with an excess of [Al2Cl7]\n- (i.e., [EMIM]Cl:AlCl3 &lt;0.5 (molar ratio)). \n\n2) Basic (with an excess of Cl- (i.e., [EMIM]Cl:AlCl3 > 0.5 (molar ratio)). \n\n3) Neutral (with a molar ratio [EMIM]Cl:AlCl3 = 0.5). \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n31 \n\n \n\nIt is well known that electrodeposition of metals from a water solution often is \n\ncarried out at low or high pH and it has a great influence on the deposition process. The \n\nanalogous situation with ILs and Lewis acidity was found.  \n\nA representative of the second generation or discrete ions ionic liquids was firstly \n\nreported by Wilkes and Zaworotko in 1992 [146]. It consisted of 1-ethyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium cation and tetrafluoroborate anion. In contrast to the first generation \n\nelectrolyte, the second one has isolated ions. Nowadays, the discrete ions ILs attract a \n\ngreat attention due to a wider electrochemical window [147] that allows electrodeposition \n\nof reactive metals. Moreover, ILs based on tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate are \n\nwater insensitive despite the fact that slow hydrolyse with HF evolution [148] occurs. The \n\nsystems with similar physical properties but absolutely water insensitive were prepared \n\nwith tri-fluromethanesulphonate (CF3SO3\n-) and bis-(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide \n\n[(CF3SO2)2N\n-] [149]. There are available several reviews about these ILs [144, 145]. \n\n2.2 Deep eutectic based ionic liquids \n\nThe ideal mixture of two components, without any interaction between them, has \n\nlinear dependence of the melting temperature on composition. In fact, mixture of two \n\ndifferent compounds has lower melting temperature than it should be in ideal mixture \n\n[150]. This negative deviation appears if components of the system have strong physical \n\ninteraction between each other. Schematically it is shown in Figure I. 11. \n\nA mixture of two components is entirely solid regardless of the molar ratio at a \n\ntemperature, which is lower than the eutectic isotherm line, and is entirely liquid upper \n\nthe liquidus line (Figure I. 11). A transition zone between liquidus and solidus lines has \n\na liquid phase and a solid component (it depends on molar ratio). Eutectic point is a \n\ncomposition of the mixture with the lowest melting temperature [150].  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 11 Schematic representation of a two component phase diagram (adapted \n\nfrom Atkins et al. [150]). \n\nSome eutectic mixtures are used for electrowinning of metals such as aluminium. \n\nHowever, their melting temperatures are comparatively high, which raises the costs of the \n\nmetal manufacturing. Only development of chloroaluminate ionic liquids allowed \n\ndecrease of the melting point down to room temperature. This system is of the interest \n\ndue to industrial importance of the aluminium. Several decades after the ionic liquids \n\nintroduction, Abbott et al. and Sun et al. showed that quarter ammonium halides also \n\nformed eutectics with zinc halides [151-153]. The general formula of such a system can \n\nbe written as (R1R2R3R4N\n+)X- Y, where ammonium (sulfonium, phosphonium) cation \n\n(R1R2R3R4N\n+) and halide anion (X-) formed the first component of the eutectic. The \n\nsecond component (Y) is a Lewis or Bronstad acid complexing agent, which complexes \n\nthe anion and delocalizes its charge. Charge delocalization leads to decrease of interaction \n\nbetween cation and anion and thereby to a decrease of the melting point. \n\nDepending on the complexing agent nature the deep eutectic solvents (DES) can \n\nbe divided into four groups [154]: \n\n \n\n? Eutectic Type 1: Y=MClx M= Zn, Sn, Fe, Al, Ga, In \n\n? Eutectic Type 2: Y=MClx yH2O = Cr. Co, Cu, Ni, Fe \n\n? Eutectic Type 3: Y=RZ, Z=CONH2, COOH, OH. \n\n? Eutectic Type 4: MClx + RZ, M=Zn, Sn, Fe and Z=CONH2, OH \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n33 \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Type I eutectics \n\nA deep eutectic solvent from the first group is formed from quaternary ammonium \n\nsalts and anhydrous metal halides. The type I eutectics are analogous to the \n\nchloroaluminate ionic liquids. The DESs can be formed from the metal halides which \n\nhave relatively low melting points such as ZnCl2 [151, 155], SnCl2 [151, 155], FeCl3 \n\n[156], GaCl3 [157], InCl3 [158]. The composition of the system strongly depends on \n\nmolar ratio of the components likewise for the chloraluminate ILs [151, 159]. It was \n\nshown that although Cl- and ZnCl3\n- ions dominate in Lewis basic liquids, there are several \n\nchlorozincate clusters (ZnCl3\n-, Zn2Cl5\n\n-, Zn3Cl7\n-) in Lewis acidic liquids. A similar \n\nbehaviour was demonstrated for the chlorostannate systems [151, 159].  \n\n2.2.2 Type II eutectics \n\nThe hydration water decreases the lattice energy and it leads to reducing of the \n\nmelting point of the salts. It extends number of metals which can form DES such as  \n\nCaCl2 \u00b7 6H2O, LaCl3 \u00b7 6H2O, CoCl2 \u00b7 6H2O, LiNO3 \u00b7 4H2O, Zn(NO3)2 \u00b7 4H2O [160], \n\nMgCl2?\u00b7?6H2O[161]. The type II eutectics are not strictly ionic liquids because of presence \n\nof hydration water, but in spite of that, their physical properties are comparable with those \n\nof the conventional ILs and water is rather ligand than solvent [162]. The water molecules \n\nare strongly coordinated to the ions and it is very difficult to reduce them that provides \n\nwider electrochemical windows than those in water based electrolytes. Unfortunately, this \n\ntype of DES is rarely studied and nowadays the influence of water molecules is not fully \n\nunderstandood. The DES containing chromium is the most investigated system [162-\n\n164]. Abbott et al. have studied this system and the lowest melting point was found for \n\n2:1 CrCl3 6H2O/ChCl ratio. Composition of this eutectic mixture was investigated using \n\nUV-vis spectrometry and it was shown that the DES contains mainly the Cr(H2O)3Cl3 \n\nspecies with small amount of [CrCl4\u00b72H2O]\n?. The presence choline cations and CrCl4\n\n- in \n\nthe eutectic was found by electrospray mass spectroscopy. Authors made a conclusion \n\nthat ChCl+ and Cl- are the main charge carrying species [162]. The cyclic voltammogram \n\nof the 2:1 CrCl3 6H2O/ChCl system shows no water reduction current which means that \n\nthe water molecules are highly coordinated and the electrolyte is not just a concentrated \n\nsolution [165].  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n34 \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Type III eutectics \n\nDES of the third type are based on formation of complexes between halogen \n\nanions and hydrogen bond donors (HBD) [166]. Formation of deep eutectic solvents was \n\nfound for a range of amides, alcohols and carboxylic acids (Figure I. 12 [154]). These \n\nliquids are easy to prepare, relatively cheap, water- and air-stable and mainly \n\nbiodegradable [144, 154]. DES of this type have been used in the current work. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 12 Structures of some halide salts and hydrogen bond donors used in the \n\nformation of deep eutectic solvents (taken from Smith et al. [154]). \n\nComposition of a deep eutectic solvent depends on the quantity of functional \n\ngroups of the hydrogen bond donors; for instance, molar ratio between urea, oxalic acid, \n\ncitric acid and quaternary ammonium salt (choline chloride) are 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2, \n\ncorrespondingly. Complexation (charge delocalization) of the halide anions occurs \n\nthrough hydrogen bond formation with HBDs. An additional proof of the presence of \n\nhydrogen bonding in the system was obtained using Heteronuclear Overhauser effect \n\nspectroscopy for choline fluoride/urea system and using FAB MS for choline chloride \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n35 \n\n \n\n(ChCl)/urea system. The signals which correspond to two urea molecules and Cl- (M-\n\n=155) and to one urea and chloride (M-=95) were observed by FAB MS [167]. \n\nThe III type eutectics have large temperature difference between real melting \n\npoint and theoretical melting point of ideal mixture, for example the practical melting \n\npoint of 1ChCl/2urea is lower for 180oC than the theoretical one [167]. Moreover, the \n\nlarge number of available hydrogen bond donors makes this class of ionic liquids \n\nattractive for industrial application because it can be easily adopted for specific usage \n\nwith a capability to dissolve a wide range of metal salts and oxide. \n\nThe DES based on the choline chloride and glycols are non-toxic and accessible \n\nto the industry [154]. For instance ChCl is a vitamin and it is produced on a large scale as \n\nanimal feed supplement. The ChCl based solvents were used in the experimental work on \n\nthe thesis because these ionic liquids have the highest conductivity, the lowest viscosity \n\nand comparatively large potential windows. These parameters are extremely important \n\nfor electrodeposition processes. \n\n2.2.4 Type IV eutectics \n\nThe mixture of metal halide with hydrogen bond donors in some situation is \n\neutectic with a near room temperature melting point. The possibility of such an eutectic \n\nhas been shown by Abbott et al. for zinc, tin (II) and iron (III) chlorides in a mixture with \n\nethylene glycol, urea or acetamide [168]. It was proposed by the authors to classify these \n\nsystems as type IV eutectics. The zinc chloride forms eutectics with urea, acetamide, \n\nethylene glycol and hexandiol in the ratios (eutectic donor/ZnCl2) 3.5, 4, 4 and 3, \n\ncorrespondingly. Ionic species identification was performed by FAB MS [168] and it was \n\nshown that together with common zinc complexes [ZnCl3]\n-, [Zn2Cl5]\n\n- and [Zn3Cl7]\n-, there \n\nare also positive species such as [ZnCl(urea)]+, [ZnCl(urea)2]\n+, [ZnCl(urea)3]\n\n+ in the IV \n\ntype of eutectics.  \n\n2.3 Physico-chemical properties \n\nThere is a number of properties that makes ionic liquids attractive for \n\nelectrochemistry. These properties allow deposition of different compounds which is \n\nimpossible with other solutions.  \n\nIonic liquids are particularly noteworthy from the electrochemical point of view, \n\nowing to their wide potential window. Typical electrochemical window for an ionic liquid \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n36 \n\n \n\nis about 4 V, although the IL with a 7 V window was also reported (electrochemical \n\nwindow of water is less than 2 V). This specific electrochemical parameter allows \n\nelectrodeposition of different active materials such as aluminum, magnesium, lithium, \n\nsodium, silicon. \n\nThe electrochemical window is not the only significant factor. The roles of such \n\nproperties as electrical and thermal conductivity, melting point and temperature of \n\ndecomposition, viscosity and diffusion coefficient, solubility of metal salts, density are \n\nalso undeniable in electrochemical processes.  \n\nThe main physico-chemical properties of ILs are covered in series of books, \n\npapers and databases [143-145, 154, 169-171]. Moreover, properties of some ionic liquids \n\nare presented in Table I. 4.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n37 \n\n \n\nTable I. 4 Main physico-chemical properties of different ionic liquids. \n\n \nIonic liquid \n\nDensity \n\ng/cm3 \n\nViscosity \n\ncP \n\nMelting Point \n\noC \n\nConductivity \n\nmS cm\u20131 \n\n1\nst\n\n g\ne\nn\ne\nra\n\nti\no\nn\n\n \n\n[EMIM][AlCl4] \n\n[BMIM][AlCl4] \n\n1,38 [169] \n\n1.25 [172] \n\n18 [169] \n\n34.0 [172] \n\n7 [169] \n\n- \n\n22,7 [173] \n\n- \n\n2\nn\nd\n G\n\ne\nn\ne\nra\n\nti\no\nn\n\n \n\n[n-Alkyl-] 3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate \n\n1-Ethyl- \n\n1-Butyl- \n\n1-Hexyl- \n\n1-Octyl- \n\n1,56 [144] \n\n1.36 [174] \n\n1.3 [175] \n\n1.24 [175] \n\nsolid \n\n395 [176] \n\n707 [177] \n\n1052 [177] \n\n62 [178] \n\n-8 [174] \n\n-61 [179] \n\n-82 [179] \n\n4.91 [180] \n\n1.4 [174] \n\n3.86 [181] \n\n2.57 [181] \n\n1-Ethyl -3-methylimidazolium [X-] \n\nMethyl sulfate \n\nButyl sulfate \n\nHexyl sulfate \n\nOctyl sulfate \n\n[CF3SO3] \n\n[CF3COO] \n\n1.29 [182] \n\n1.18 [182] \n\n1.13 [182] \n\n1.1 [182] \n\n1.38 [149] \n\n1.29 [149] \n\n99.7 [182] \n\n242.3 [182] \n\n428.3 [182] \n\n856.0 [182] \n\n45 [149] \n\n32 [183] \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n-9 [149] \n\n-14 [149] \n\n6.02 [184] \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n8.6 [149] \n\n9.6 [149] \n\nD\nE\n\nS\n \n\nI, II and IV type \n\nChCl/2ZnCl2 \n\nChCl/2CrCl3 6H2O \n\n3.5Urea/ZnCl2 \n\n- \n\n- \n\n1.63 [168] \n\n85000 [151] \n\n4500 [162] \n\n11340 [168] \n\n25 [151] \n\n13 [162] \n\n9 [168] \n\n0.036 [151] \n\n0.7 [162] \n\n- \n\nIII type \n\nChCl/2Urea \n\nChCl/2EG \n\nChCl/Oxalic acid \n\n1.18 [185] \n\n1.11 [185] \n\n- \n\n1100 [167] \n\n23 [185] \n\n160 [166] \n\n12 [167] \n\n- \n\n34 [166] \n\n1.5 [167] \n\n7.2 [185] \n\n3 [166] \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n38 \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Density \n\nIn general, ionic liquids have higher density than that of water. One can see from \n\nTable I. 4 that the density values are in the range from 1.1 to 1.6 g/cm3. \n\nAlthough a dependence between structure of ions and density of the corresponding \n\nionic liquids has not been found yet, several tendencies described in literature [143, 144, \n\n169, 171] should be mentioned here. First of all, a noteworthy detail is that an increase of \n\nthe length of alkyl radicals both in cations and in anions leads to density decreasing [186]. \n\nA good example of this is imidazolium based ionic liquids. Changing of the carbon \n\nnumber in the row 1-Ethyl-; 1-Butyl-; 1-Hexyl-; 1-Octyl-3-methylimidazolium \n\nhexafluorophosphate results in a decrease in density as 1.56; 1.37; 1.31; 1.23 g/cm3, \n\ncorrespondingly. Similar trend with growing of alkyl radicals can be observed in anions. \n\nFor example, 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation ([EMIM]) with different alkyl-\n\nsulphate anions methyl; butyl; hexyl; octyl sulphate have the density values 1.29; 1.18; \n\n1.13 and 1.1 g/cm3, correspondingly [182]. Moreover, it is important to mention that \n\nsubstitution of light radical for a heavier one, without big difference of sizes, leads to an \n\nincrease in density. For instance, [EMIM][CH3SO3] and [EMIM][CF3SO3] have 1.25 and \n\n1.38 g/cm3, correspondingly. However, for such heavy radicals the inverse dependence \n\ncan be found: in spite of carbon chain growing, [EMIM][CF3COO] and \n\n[EMIM][C3F7COO] have the densities of 1.29 and 1.45 g/cm\n3. \n\n2.3.2 Viscosity \n\nViscosity of ionic liquids is higher than that of the molecular solvents. Values of \n\nthe viscosity of most of the ILs presented in Table I. 4 are in the range of 10-1000 cP \n\n(0.01-1 Pa s). This is higher than the water viscosity by one to four orders of magnitude \n\n(water \u2013 0.89 cP). The ionic liquids viscosity is determined by the Van Der Waal\u2019s forces \n\nand by abilities of the ions to form hydrogen bonds [169]. Size and structure of the ions \n\nhave a strong influence on viscosity as they do on density. Growth of the alkyl radicals\u2019 \n\nlength leads to reinforcement of the Van Der Waals interaction and increases viscosity. It \n\nwas found that hydrogen bonding has a similar trend. Ionic liquids with BF4\n- and PF6\n\n- \n\nhave a higher viscosity values due to the hydrogen bonds formation. The electrostatic \n\ninteraction also plays an important role here [169]. \n\nViscosity is a crucial parameter for electrochemistry because it has a strong impact \n\non conductivity [171, 187] and kinetics. High viscosity of ILs mainly impairs diffusion \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n39 \n\n \n\nof metal species to the working electrode which means restrictions to the mass transport. \n\nAlthough it was reported that increasing of temperature results in decreasing of viscosity \n\nof ILs [188-192], but usage of them at high temperature partially contradicts the idea of \n\nroom temperature ionic liquids. It was found that small amounts of different impurities, \n\nsuch as water, in ionic liquids lead to strong changes in physico-chemical properties \n\nincluding viscosity [193, 194]. Nowadays, dilutants are often added to ionic liquids and \n\nDES to decrease viscosity, remove diffusion limitations and increase conductivity [195-\n\n199]. These substances and their amounts are different for each specific case depending \n\non the ionic liquid composition and materials planned to be deposited. Commonly they \n\nare different alcohols, hydrocarbons, ethers etc. In some cases, a small amount of water \n\ncan be also used as dilutant.  \n\n2.3.3 Temperature range \n\nMelting point and decomposition temperature are two main thermal \n\ncharacteristics of ionic liquids as electrolytes. First of all, it is important to know the \n\nmelting temperature. Commonly, inorganic salts melt at temperature of the order of \n\nthousand degrees because of a strong electrostatic interaction between ions.  \n\nThe term \u201croom temperature ionic liquids\u201d clearly indicates that these materials \n\nare in liquid state at room temperature. It is possible due to usage of organic molecules \n\nwhere charge is distributed over a big volume which significantly decreases interaction \n\nbetween ions. It is evident that structure of ions and composition of ionic liquid have a \n\nstrong impact on the temperature parameters [169]. Unfortunately, as with viscosity and \n\ndensity, precise correlation between structure and melting or decomposition points has \n\nnot been found yet. At the same time, the main tendencies can be revealed for certain \n\nnumber of parameters. Melting temperature of ionic liquids, by analogy with inorganic \n\nsalts, decreases with increasing of the ions size. It happens because in molecule with \n\nbigger ions, distance between their centres increases and surface charge decreases, which \n\nresults in lower electrostatic interactions [169]. Apart from the size effect, structure of the \n\nILs species has a considerable effect on properties which makes an estimation of the \n\nthermal properties much more difficult. For example, ionic liquids with aromatic cation \n\nhave lower melting points than that with aliphatic one because of the charge \n\ndelocalization. Concerning side-chain size, initial increasing of carbon number leads to a \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n40 \n\n \n\nlower melting point, but with large radicals the orientation effect and solidification of the \n\nsystem can be observed.  \n\nInfluence of the anion structure on the melting temperature is similar to the above-\n\ndescribed one for the cation structure. Presence of bigger anions and the anions with \n\nhigher charge delocalization implies lower electrostatic interaction and, thereby, a lower \n\nmelting point. \n\nThe maximal temperature, at which the use of an ionic liquid without \n\ndecomposition or other chemical changes can be implemented, is also an important \n\nparameter for certain applications. ILs with the decomposition temperature of about 400-\n\n450oC were reported [178, 200]. However, it was mentioned that a degradation of the ILs \n\nstarts below the above-mentioned range. That is why the usage of the electrolyte at \n\ntemperatures which are close to the decomposition range for a long time is not \n\nrecommended. Data on decomposition temperature of some ionic liquids is shown in \n\nFigure I. 13 [144]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 13 Relation between thermal decomposition temperature of 1-alkyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium-type ILs with alkyl chain length (adapted from Endres and \n\nAbbott [144]). \n\n2.3.4 Conductivity \n\nConductivity of ionic liquids is lower than that of the concentrated water solution \n\n(about 10 mS cm-1), because the large size of ions and its aggregations lead to limited \n\nmobility of charge carriers. At the same time, ILs show good ionic conductivity, which is \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n41 \n\n \n\nmakes them similar to the best non-aqueous electrolytes. Conductivity of a RTIL has a \n\nstrong correlation with viscosity. These two parameters are combined in Walden\u2019s rule \n\n[201]: \n\n \n\n??=constant (I.18) \n\nwhere ? is molar conductivity of the ionic liquid, and ? is a viscosity \n\nIt is obvious from Walden\u2019s rule that ionic liquids with higher viscosity have \n\nlower conductivity. Moreover, as it was mentioned before, with temperature increasing \n\nthe viscosity decreases and consequently conductivity increases [202]. Some ionic liquids \n\nmight have conductivity of about 10 S cm-1 at 200oC.  \n\nHigh resistivity of ILs as electrolyte is a negative factor and due to high Ohmic \n\nloss, their applications in industry are limited. \n\n2.3.5 Electrochemical windows \n\nElectrochemical window is a potential range for any electrolyte where no \n\nelectrochemical processes i.e., oxidation or reduction of the electrolyte occur [203]. \n\nTherefore, electrochemical window (Ew) is a measure of electrochemical stability of the \n\nelectrolyte. It is well known that this range is very narrow for water based electrolytes, \n\nnamely about 1.2 V, which imposes constraints on their electrochemical behaviour. \n\nAlthough the electrochemical window of ILs is typically around 4-5 V [144], but the ionic \n\nliquid with 7 V [204] does also exist. Table I. 5 presents the electrochemical properties \n\nof some ionic liquids together with the measurement conditions. \n\n  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n42 \n\n \n\nTable I. 5 Main electrochemical properties of ionic liquids. \n\n \n\nUnfortunately, the ranges of electrochemical stability reported in literature for the \n\nsame ionic liquids are different. Even small amount of impurities dramatically changes \n\nproperties of ILs. For example, a negligible amount of water result in a decrease of the \n\nelectrochemical window due to the hydrogen reduction [203]. Moreover, it is important \n\nto know the material of the working electrode; because, depending on the electrochemical \n\nproperties of the materials, current appears at different potentials. It can be demonstrated \n\nfor the case of either platinum or tungsten electrodes (Table I. 5). Platinum is a good \n\ncatalyst and the electrochemical window for the platinum working electrode is smaller \n\nthan that for tungsten one.  \n\nIn general, ionic liquids with quaternary ammonium cations show a wide \n\nelectrochemical window owing to a relatively low potential of the reduction. For instance, \n\nthe reduction potential of the imidazolium based electrolytes is higher than that of the \n\nIonic liquid [REF] \nEred \n\n(V) \n\nEox \n\n(V) \n\nEW \n\n(V) \n\nWorking \n\nelectrode \nReference electrode \n\nClassical ionic liquids \n\nEMIM[AlCl4] [205] -2.1 2.35 4.45 GC Al/A1C13:2DMPrIC \n\nEMIM[AlCl4] [205] -2.1 2.3 4.4 W Al/A1C13:2DMPrIC \n\nEMIM[AlCl4] [205] -1.85 1.95 3.8 Pt Al/A1C13:2DMPrIC \n\n[EMIM][BF4]\n- [204] -2.6 2.6 5.2 GC Ag/AgNO3 \n\n[EMIM][BF4]\n- [206] \n\n[EMIM][BF4]\n- [207] \n\n[EMIM][(CF3SO2)2N\n-] \n\n[207] \n\n-2 \n\n-2.2 \n\n-2.4 \n\n2 \n\n1.6 \n\n2.2 \n\n4 \n\n3.8 \n\n4.6 \n\nPt \n\nGC \n\nGC \n\nAg/AgCl \n\nFc/Fc+ \n\nFc/Fc+ \n\n1-butylpyridinium  \n\n[BF4]\n- [206] \n\n-1 2.4 3.4 Pt Ag/AgCl \n\nTetrabutylammonium \n\n[(C2F5)3PF3]\n- [204] \n\n-3.3 \n\n \n\n3.7 \n\n \n\n7 GC Ag/AgNO3 \n\n \n\nDeep Eutectic Solvents \n\nChCl/2CrCl3 \u00b7 6H2O [162] 0 1.5 1.5 Pt Cr wire \n\nChCl/Urea [208] -1.2 1.25 2.45 Pt Ag wire \n\n3.5Urea/1ZnCl2 [168] -0.75 1.25 2 Pt Pt wire \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n43 \n\n \n\nquaternary ammonium based one (Table I. 5). It can be explained by the existence of the \n\nactive proton in the imidazolium ion structure. At the same time, pyridinium can be \n\nreduced with less difficulties in comparison with the imidazolium [206]. Furthermore, \n\nstructure and nature of anions influence significantly the electrochemical stability of ILs. \n\nTetrafluoroborate and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide are the ions with the highest \n\noxidation potentials. \n\nThe electrochemical studies are often carried out in three electrode cells. There is \n\na reference electrode together with the working and the counter electrodes in such cells. \n\nElectrochemistry of ionic liquids is relatively new area and a standard reference electrode \n\nto work in ILs has not been defined yet [209] as, for example, silver chloride, calomel \n\nand others for the water based electrolytes. Reference electrodes used in ILs today can be \n\ndivided in three groups [210]. The first is a quasi-reference electrode, the simplest \n\nelectrode in terms of design. It contains metallic wire (platinum, silver, aluminium, zinc \n\netc.) which is immersed in the electrolyte and separated from the reaction area by a \n\nmembrane. The second type of reference electrodes is similar to the common electrodes \n\nfor aqueous electrolytes: for instance, a silver wire covered by silver chloride and \n\nimmersed in solution of a silver compound in organic solvent. The third type of reference \n\nelectrodes is an electrode with Red/Ox couple. Most frequently, researchers use a \n\nferrocene (II/III) couple, which is recommended by IUPAC, or an I-/I3\n- couple. \n\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to use the same redox couple in all types of ionic liquids \n\nbecause these compounds can affect electrochemistry of the system. Detailed pre-\n\nexperimental investigations should be performed to determine the potential for use in each \n\nspecific ILs [210]. A wide number of available electrodes leads to different values of \n\noxidation and reduction potential of ionic liquids presented in literature. \n\nWide electrochemical window is an electrochemical property of high importance, \n\nbut for successful plating it is also critical to pay attention to all factors, depending on the \n\ndesirable aims. \n\n2.4 Electrochemical  application  of  ionic  liquids  and  deep  \n\neutectic  solvents \n\nOne of the major applications of the ionic liquids is electrodeposition [211]. \n\nNowadays, most of the metals can reduced from different ILs (Figure I. 14). All marked \n\nelements can be deposited as pure metals or as alloys [144, 154, 165, 171, 209, 212, 213]. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 14 Periodic table with highlighted elements which were deposited from ILs. \n\n2.4.1 Electrodeposition from ionic liquids \n\nHistorically, the AlCl3-based ILs were the first type of ionic liquids applied for \n\nelectrodeposition of metals. These ionic liquids have several drawbacks such as the \n\nelectrochemical window limitation through reduction of aluminium, as well as water- and \n\nair sensitivity. The last two disadvantages can be avoided by using close atmosphere, \n\nwhereas the first one (electrochemical window) strongly limits the number of deposited \n\nmaterials. It means that a lot of diverse metals were deposited not at pure state but as \n\nalloys with aluminium. Nevertheless, a great number of metals was deposited from this \n\ntype of ionic liquids. \n\nFirst of all, attention should be paid to aluminium, because the majority of works \n\nin chloroaluminate ILs is done on electrodeposition of this metal. The aluminium \n\nelectrodeposition is of interest for industry owing to high corrosion stability provided by \n\noxide layer formed on the metal interface. Aluminium was successfully deposited from \n\nionic liquids containing different cations such as EMIM [214, 215], BMIM [216], \n\nbutylpyridinium [217], benzyltrimethylammonium [218]. Different cations offer different \n\nphysical properties of ILs such as viscosity, electrochemical window, water sensitivity \n\netc., as it was described in the previous part. Moreover, electrodeposition of aluminium \n\nwas performed on different substrates including glassy carbon, steel, gold, platinum. \n\nThese first experiments show a wide range of possible ionic liquids applications.  \n\nThe electrodeposition of lithium from EMIMCl/AlCl3 with addition of lithium \n\nchloride was demonstrated for the first time in 1985 [219]. 10 years later, sodium was \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n45 \n\n \n\nfirstly reduced from the same ionic liquid by Gray et al [220]. Some less reactive elements \n\nsuch as silver, copper [221], indium [222], cobalt [223], zinc [224], gallium [225], \n\nantimony [226], tellurium [227], gold [228] were also successfully deposited afterwards. \n\nFurthermore, the experiments with deposition of alloys, rather than pure metals, were also \n\nsuccessfully implemented (magnesium alloy [229], titanium alloy [230]).  \n\nThe chloroaluminate based ILs were substituted in 1990s by the discrete ions ILs \n\n[146]. The use of tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, \n\nbis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anions improves both chemical and electrochemical \n\nstabilities. The increase of the electrochemical stability extends the number of metals \n\navailable for deposition. The second generation of ILs allows to deposit not only \n\ncomparatively noble metals e.g., cadmium [231], gold [232], copper [233], selenium \n\n[158, 234] but also materials that can be reduced neither from water based solution nor \n\nfrom chloroaluminate systems (magnesium [235], titanium (thin film) [236], silicon [237, \n\n238], caesium [239]).  \n\nApart from the pure metals the electrodeposition of alloys and other compounds \n\nwas also widely studied in available ionic liquids. Several technically important alloys \n\nand semiconductors such as Zn/Sn [240], GaAs [241], InSb [242], ZnTe [243] were \n\ndeposited. \n\n2.4.2 Electrodeposition from deep eutectic solvent \n\nThe third type of deep eutectics based on choline chloride is not toxic and has a \n\nlow cost and, therefore, it has been intensively studied after the introduction made by \n\nAbbott et al. in 2004 [166]. These DES are flexible and adaptable for necessary conditions \n\ndue to the large number of available HBD. The applications of DES are limited by \n\nelectrochemical window (normally about 3 V), that does not allow the electrodeposition \n\nof electronegative metals such as titanium, aluminium and alkali metals from these \n\neutectics. Nevertheless, at the industry scale, DES are deemed to be promising substitutes \n\nof the water electrolytes for deposition of metals (zinc [208, 244-246], copper [247], \n\nnickel [248], tin [208]) and alloys, for instance Zn/Sn [208], Zn/Ni [249]. Increase of the \n\ncurrent efficiency and improvement of the surface reproducibility are the most significant \n\neffects of choline based electrolytes application. \n\nZinc is one of the most important metals in plating industry due to the corrosion \n\nresistance and a low price. Electrodeposition of this metal has been widely studied. Initial \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n46 \n\n \n\nstudies of zinc electrodeposition from choline chloride ethylene glycol (1:2) DES were \n\ncarried out by Whitehead et al. [246]. They showed that electroreduction of zinc on glassy \n\ncarbon rod occurs much faster when the potential is increased from more negative (-0.8V) \n\nto -0.4 - -0.2V vs Zn/Zn2+ quasi-reference electrode. It can be explained by formation of \n\nso-called Z species (intermediate compounds) which are reduced at higher potential. \n\nThen, Vieira together with Whitehead and Gollas studied this phenomenon particularly \n\nand confirmed the formation of Z species in the diffusion layer [250].  \n\nAbbott et al. have studied the influence of double layer on the zinc nucleation \n\n[185]. They used two types of ILs based on choline chloride with different HBD (either \n\nurea or ethylene glycol). It is shown that the deposit has different structures explained by \n\nblocking of certain crystal faces in glycol-contained electrolyte. Bakkar and Neubert \n\n[245] electrodeposited zinc on magnesium from choline based DES with four different \n\nHBDs: urea, ethylene glycol, glycerol and malonic acid. Such zinc coating was used in \n\norder to protect Mg from corrosion. The ChCl/urea eutectic is considered to be the most \n\nsuitable liquid for successful electroplating. As it was recently shown by Vieira et al. \n\n[251], the working electrode materials also have a strong impact on nucleation and \n\ndeposition processes. These authors used glassy carbon, stainless steel, gold, platinum \n\ncopper and zinc as substrates to study the hydrogen overpotential and possible Z species \n\nformation. Formation of a compact blocking layer on the electrode interface, which \n\ninhibits the electrodeposition of zinc, has been noted. \n\nNowadays, improvement of the coating quality, brightening, efficiency increment \n\nduring electroplating are achieved via addition of some specific compounds. Nonetheless, \n\nadditives for electrodeposition from DES are barely studied. The first full investigation \n\nof the influence of three polar additives (acetonitrile, ethylene diamine, and ammonium \n\nhydroxide) on the nucleation of zinc and the morphology of the coating was published by \n\nAbbott et al. in 2011 [199]. Ammonia and ethylene diamine additives result in effective \n\nbrightening of the coating. Ibrahim [198] et al. also studied the influence of acetonitrile \n\nand ethylene diamine on electrodeposition of zinc. They mentioned that additives \n\npromote reduction at less negative potential, although the current efficiency decreases.  \n\nApplication of DES for metals plating is new and promising area. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n47 \n\n \n\n2.5 Electrode/electrolyte interface \n\nThe ionic liquids behaviour differ greatly from that of the common water based \n\nelectrolytes and the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface are not an exception. \n\nThe main difference occurs because ILs contain only charged species in contrast to \n\nmolecular liquid. As a result, additional interionic forces such as Coulomb, Van der Waals \n\nand hydrogen bonding arise. All these interactions promote formation of nanostructures \n\nin both bulk deposit and at the electrolyte/electrified interface [252, 253]. Formation of \n\nmultilayered structure was confirmed by several independent techniques, namely high \n\nenergy X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, \n\nelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The strong ILs adsorbance onto solid interface \n\nand formation of multilayer superstructure was reported [253-257]. Moreover, it was also \n\ndemonstrated that applied potential has a strong impact on the ions arrangement: the \n\nsurface structure is more obvious both at more positive and more negative potentials. The \n\ngenerally accepted model of the electrode/ILs interface is presented in Figure I. 15 [209]. \n\nThe single layer of ions mostly neutralizes the electrode charge and this layer is also \n\ncompensated by other oppositely charged ion layers. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I. 15 Schematic diagrams of the electrode-electrolyte interface in ionic liquid. \n\n(Adapted from Abbott et al. [209]) \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n48 \n\n \n\nBesides experimental studies, the molecular dynamics calculations and Monte \n\nCarlo simulations [258-261] were also performed for theoretical descriptions of the \n\nelectrolyte/electrode systems. The calculated data were found to be in a good agreement \n\nwith the experimental results. \n\nDES and classical ILs show similar behaviour on the electrode surface. Several \n\nstudies of interfaces in the deep eutectic solvents based on choline chloride were reported \n\n[262, 263]. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were \n\nused in these works for the interface investigation. The capacitance values at different \n\npotentials were measured for the ChCl:2Glycerol eutectic on glassy carbon, platinum and \n\ngold electrodes [262]. It was shown that measured capacity depends on the electrode \n\nmaterial. For instance, replacing glassy carbon electrode by platinum one leads to an \n\nincrease of the capacity value for all potentials, although the shape of the curves remains \n\nsimilar. Moreover, increasing temperature results in an increase of the differential \n\ncapacity. The results of the study [262] correlate with the reported data for conventional \n\nionic liquids. Another study on the structure of double layer were performed on mercury \n\nelectrode in choline based DESs with different hydrogen bond donors (urea, 1,2 and 1,3 \n\npropanediol, ethylene glycol) [263]. Authors concluded that at negative potential, the \n\ndouble layer structure on mercury electrode is similar to one observed in aqueous \n\nelectrolyte solution. They assumed presence of a hydrogen bond donors layer between \n\nthe electrode and cations at negative potential. The observed growth of the capacitance at \n\npositive potential was attributed to adsorption of free chloride ions.  \n\nThe double layer structure in both ionic liquids and eutectic solvents is not well \n\nunderstood for both ionic liquids and eutectic solvents despite of the numerous studies \n\nand calculations performed. Therefore, new studies should be undertaken in order to \n\nimprove the understanding of role of the ionic species and their behaviour on the \n\nelectrified interface.   \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n49 \n\n \n\nThesis objectives  \n\nThe main goal of this PhD work is electrosynthesys of 1-D zinc nanorods from \n\ncholine chloride based ionic liquid by using the template assisted techniques. A novelty \n\nof this research is a use of the not-detached template, which allows reducing the price and \n\nthe time for the nanomaterials preparation. During the work, two most common porous \n\nanodic templates (porous anodic titania and porous anodic alumina) were carefully \n\nstudied with particular attention to barrier layer influence. The electrochemical processes \n\nthat occur during nanowires fabrication have a noticeable influence of the barrier layer \n\nthickness. This specific influence was studied step-by-step from a flat dense oxide layer \n\nto the porous templates. The studies revealed several ways of deposition and modification \n\nof the porous templates for the successful nanoparticles preparation.  \n\nZinc has been used as a model material with a possible further conversion to \n\nsemiconductive materials such as zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc selenide or substitution by \n\nother materials. The use of the ionic liquids as electrolyte also gives vast array of possible \n\nsecondary materials and excludes several negative effects of the water based electrolytes \n\nnamely a narrow electrochemical window, hydrogen evolution, toxic components. We \n\nalso observed the specific adsorption of the electrolyte components on the electrode \n\nsurface which hinders the reduction of the zinc species. An appropriate way to solve the \n\nproblem was also developed. \n\nRegarding the main objectives, it is possible to highlight the followings:  \n\n1) synthesis of the dense and porous anodic films on the valve metals (aluminium \n\nand titanium); \n\n2) physico-chemical characterization of the templates; \n\n3) correlation of the applied voltage, film thickness, film structure with the \n\nobserved kinetics of zinc reduction on the dense barrier layer; \n\n4) investigation of the electrical double layer on the oxide/electrolyte interface and \n\nits influence on deposition process;  \n\n5) adaptation of the results obtained on the dense anodic films to the porous \n\ntemplates;  \n\n6) modification of porous anodic template for the synthesis of nanoparticles;  \n\n7) electrodeposition of zinc inside the porous templates and characterization of \n\nthe obtained materials. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n50 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n[1] N.E.M.

A brief overview of the techniques used in the work is also done here. \n\nBesides, the experimental details are additionally described in each chapter of the Results. \n\nThe main objective of the work was electrodeposition of zinc in non-detached \n\nporous anodic templates. In the first step, investigation was performed on bulk anodic \n\nfilms. For this purpose, dense anodic layers of various thickness on titanium and \n\naluminium were prepared and characterized. Then, porous templates on the same metals \n\nwere prepared and studied. In the following step, electrochemical behavior of the anodic \n\nfilms in deep eutectic solvent was considered. Finally, the results obtained for the planar \n\nanodic layers were analyzed and applied to the porous templates. The essential parameters \n\nof the electrodeposition process have been established and modification of the templates \n\nfor successful Zn filling (where applicable) have been performed. The full scheme of the \n\nPhD work is schematically depicted on the Figure II. 1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II. 1 Summary of the experimental research performed during the PhD work. \n\n  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n64 \n\n \n\n1. Procedures description \n\nThe first stage of the work consists in the electrodes and electrolyte preparation. \n\nAs it was mentioned above, the deep eutectic solvent based on the choline chloride was \n\nchosen as electrolyte. This type of ionic liquids can be prepared by simple mixing of the \n\ncholine chloride and the hydrogen bond donor. In our case, the latter was ethylene glycol. \n\nThe molar ratio of the components was 1 ChCl to 2 EG that corresponds to the eutectic \n\npoint of the mixture. An appropriate amount of zinc was dissolved in the eutectic at 60oC \n\nand then the electrolyte was kept under vacuum for 24 hours. Between the experiments, \n\nthe solution was stored in desiccator over P2O5. \n\nInitially, the metallic substrate was polished at suitable conditions and then \n\nanodized in two electrode cells. In this system, the chosen substrate (aluminium or \n\ntitanium) was used as the working electrode and platinum foil was used as the counter \n\nelectrode. Two types of electrolyte, with and without aggressive ions, were used for \n\npreparation of porous and dense anodic films, correspondingly. The dense barrier layer \n\nwas formed in neutral solution (ammonium pentaborate), because alumina is sensitive to \n\npH and easily dissolves in an acidic solution. As opposed to bulk layers, the porous oxides \n\nwere produced in acidic electrolyte (oxalic acid) because of the same reason of the pH \n\nsensitivity of alumina. Since titania is indifferent to pH, the bulk titania anodic films can \n\nbe obtained in many different of electrolytes. The sulfuric acid solution was used for that \n\naim due to high reproducibility and stability of the obtaining layer. In the case of porous \n\ntemplate formation, the ethylene glycol based electrolyte, with small amount of water and \n\nfluoride ions, has been used. The fact that the electrolyte is based on ethylene glycol \n\nallowed preparation of long pores with smooth walls. Presence of fluoride ions was \n\nimportant because exactly these ions promote dissolution of the barrier titania. \n\nCommonly, bulk oxide layer preparation is carried out in one step (galvanostatic \n\noxidation). However, the two-step technique is the most desirable way of formation of \n\nhigh-ordered porous anodic templates. Both steps are normally performed at the same \n\nconditions (electrolyte, temperature, voltage) and only the removal of the oxides (either \n\nchemical or mechanical) splits the steps. Detailed descriptions of the anodization \n\nmechanism and of the used parameters are presented in the State of the art and Results \n\n(papers), correspondingly. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n65 \n\n \n\nThe electrodes were fully characterized after preparation. The morphological \n\nproperties, such as topography, pore diameter, interpore distance, pores ordering, \n\nthickness of the pores layer, and crystallinity of the templates were assessed using \n\nscanning and transmission electron microscopies. The barrier oxide layer thicknesses \n\nwere estimated by several techniques, namely glow discharge optical emission \n\nspectroscopy, ellipsometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. \n\nAt the second stage of the work, the electrochemical behavior of the electrodes \n\ncovered by dense anodic alumina or titania was investigated. It has been done in three \n\nelectrode cell to ensure a higher-precision control of the potential on the working \n\nelectrode. In the frame of this step, influence of the film thickness and temperature of the \n\nsolution on the kinetics of zinc reduction was studied using both cyclic and linear \n\nvoltammetry as well as chronoamperometry. I(t) curves gave indication of the mechanism \n\nof nucleation which is an important factor for the electrodeposition process. SEM and \n\nAFM were used in order to confirm nucleation mechanism which was obtained by I(t) \n\ncurves analyses.  \n\nFurthermore, strong influence of electrical double layer (EDL) on the zinc species \n\nreduction was observed during the electrochemical measurements, which increased \n\ninterest in studying this phenomenon. The EDL was explored by attenuated total \n\nreflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, the use of AC signal \n\nsuperimposed on a bias potential to avoid the blockage effect of the dense organic layer \n\n(EDL) at the electrodeposition to porous alumina templates was explored. \n\nAt the last stage, the parameters, and conditions revealed and then optimized for \n\nthe dense anodic oxides were summarized and applied to the porous templates. It was \n\ndecided to use two-step electrodeposition for filling of porous anodic alumina templates. \n\nThe first step, a pulse electrodeposition, leads to zinc nucleation on bottoms of the pores. \n\nThe second one results in the galvanostatic pores filling. Concerning the porous anodic \n\ntitania, several modifications such as annealing and electrochemical selective \n\ncrystallization were performed to achieve successful filling of the titania nanotubes by \n\nzinc in one step. Control of the pores filling was performed using SEM, TEM, EDX and \n\nGDOES techniques. \n\n  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n66 \n\n \n\n2. Techniques overview  \n\nElectron microscopy \n\nScanning and transmission electron microscopies are important tools for \n\nmorphological characterization of materials. In these techniques, an electron beam is used \n\nfor illumination, which allows a higher resolution than when using a visible light beam. \n\nMathematically, the resolution can be described by Abbe\u2019s equation: \n\n \n\n? =\n0.612 ?\n\n? ????\n   (II.1) \n\n \n\nwhere (n sin?) is numerical aperture (NA), d is resolution and ? is wavelength of the \n\nimaging radiation. According to equation (II.1), the limit of optical resolution is about \n\n2000 \u00c5 for the violet light (?=4000 \u00c5 and NA = 1.25). The electron beam wavelength is \n\nmuch smaller that results in a higher resolution (d = 0.2 \u00c5, by the same equation) [1]. \n\nThe electron beam, emitted by electron gun, is accelerated and goes through the \n\nseries of electromagnetic lenses which focus it on the sample. There are two groups of \n\ninteractions of the electron beam with a sample: elastic and inelastic. The first group is \n\ncharacterised by wide-angle changes in electron trajectory and insignificant energy losses \n\nof the scattered electrons. Typical signal after elastic scattering, used for imaging, is \n\ncontributed by backscattered electrons (BSE). BSE signal provides both topographical \n\nand compositional information. The compositional information is possible to receive \n\nbecause the intensity of the signal strongly depends on the atomic numbers of the \n\nelements in the sample [1, 2].  \n\nThe second group, inelastic scattering, is characterized by significant amount of \n\nenergy transferring from the incident beam to the specimen atoms. This interaction leads \n\nto excitation of the atoms and to generation of the secondary electrons with the energy \n\nless than 50 eV. Such a signal is widely used for visualization of surface texture of the \n\nsample. Another signal which also appears, when excited atom returns to ground state, is \n\ncharacteristic X-ray (EDX). EDX allows both qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis \n\nof the chemical composition [1, 2]. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n67 \n\n \n\nBesides the above-described signals, there are also other signals, such as \n\ncontinuum X-rays, Auger electrons, cathodoluminescence, and specimen current. All of \n\nthem, except continuum X-rays, can be used for the specimen characterization [2, 3]. \n\nSEM was actively used during this PhD work for characterization of the deposits \n\nboth on the dense anodic layers and inside the porous anodic templates. Moreover, the \n\nmicrostructure of the porous templates was also controlled by SEM. The deposits \n\ncomposition and distribution of the deposited particles over the electrode interface were \n\ncontrolled by EDX and BSE analyses. \n\nThe electrons from the incident beam can be transmitted through the sample if it \n\nis thin enough. Transmitted electrons participate in formation of electron diffraction \n\nimage or TEM image. Two different modes are commonly applied for TEM analyses. \n\nThe first and the most common one is a bright field imaging mode. In this mode, the \n\ncontrast is formed \u201cclassically\u201d; in other words, by direct occlusion and absorption of the \n\nelectrons from the incident beam in the samples. It means that the thicker part of the \n\nsample or part containing heavier elements will be darker than the thinner region or area \n\nout of the sample. The second type is a dark field mode when unscattered (direct) beam \n\nis blocked by aperture. It leads to dark areas if there is no sample (beam passing without \n\nany interaction) and only scattered electrons make the bright places in the image. Dark \n\nfield mode is very useful for particles size measurements and planar defects investigations \n\n[3].  \n\nCommonly TEM provides a higher resolution than SEM due to the use of the \n\nelectron beam with a higher energy, but the sample preparation for TEM is more \n\ncomplicated. Nevertheless, presence and morphology of the secondary materials, \n\ncrystallinity and structure of the tubes were studied by TEM. \n\nKey benefits of these techniques are high resolution, possibility to measure a large \n\nvariety of the materials characteristics, short analysis time etc. The drawbacks are the \n\nfollowing: use of high vacuum in the electrode beam area, sampling (TEM), sample \n\npreparation (TEM), possible damage by electron beam and interpretation of the results \n\n(TEM).  \n\nGlow discharge optical emission spectroscopy \n\nGDOES is an effective technique for elemental surface analysis and depth \n\nprofiling of bulk solids and thin films. The working principle is based on the detection of \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n68 \n\n \n\nthe photons which come from the highly-excited atoms during its de-excitation to a lower-\n\nenergy state or to the ground state.  \n\nAccording to the quantum mechanics principles, in contrast to classical \n\nmechanics, electrons in the atoms can have only certain value of energy. Each pair of \n\nprincipal quantum number and azimuthal quantum number corresponds to only one \n\nspecific energy level of electron. It is well known, that all atoms have a large number of \n\npossible energy levels, but not all of them are stable. Thus, excited atom returns to the \n\nground state through one or several steps and, at each step, the energy difference releases \n\nin the form of radiation. The energy (E) and the frequency of the emitted photon (?) are \n\nlinked by the Planck\u2013Einstein relation: \n\n \n\nE=h?  (II.2) \n\n \n\nwhere h is Plank constant (6.626 10?34 J?s). \n\nSince the photon frequency is specific for each de-excitation step and for each \n\ndifferent atom, it is possible to identify the atoms type and quantity the atoms from \n\nanalysis of the emission spectra. \n\nThe sample should be atomized before excitation. The low-pressure plasma is \n\nused in the GDOES equipment for that aim. The plasma is induced by electrical current \n\npassed through the gas (argon is mostly used) under a low pressure. The electron flow \n\ninteracts with inert argon atoms and forms a plasma. The plasma is not homogeneous and \n\ncontains four different regions (Figure II. 2) [4]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II. 2 Schematic representation of the glow discharge plasma and distribution \n\nof light zones (adapted from Weston [4]). \n\nThe cathode dark space (CDS), also called the cathode fall, is about 1 mm length. \n\nMost of the potential differences between anode and cathode happen in this region. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n69 \n\n \n\nAnother region is called negative glow (NG) and its length has several millimeters. This \n\nregion is almost field free and it is the biggest part of the plasma [4]. Formation of the \n\nsimilar zones (anode dark space and positive glow region) near anode has been also found \n\nin some sources. The phenomenon is irrelevant for our system because of the small \n\ndistance between anode and cathode [5, 6].  \n\nThe positive species (mostly Ar) are accelerated in the CDS region by electrical \n\nfield and bombard the cathode (sample) surface. Moreover, significant part of ions regains \n\nelectrons by means of collisions with neutral atoms. It leads to conversion of the neutral \n\natoms and ions to the slow ions and fast neutral atoms, correspondingly. Both ions and \n\nthe fast neutral atoms have enough kinetic energy for the sample sputtering [6]. \n\nThe sputtered atoms move away from the sample surface to the NG region, which \n\ncontains enough electrons with the energies sufficient to excite these atoms. Finally, \n\nexcited atoms de-excite with emitting of the characteristic photons [6]. \n\nThe GDOES technique has been used along all the work for determination of both \n\nthe thicknesses and the composition qualitative characterization of the anodic films. \n\nBesides, GDOES has been applied to study the mechanism of the pore filling. The \n\npossibility to control the sputtering rate by the plasma energy allowed carrying the soft \n\nplasma polishing of the samples before SEM studies that broadens significantly \n\nopportunity of the SEM analyses. \n\nThe disadvantages of GDOES are the following: a strong influence of the surface \n\ncondition, obligatory calibration for quantification, difficulties to analyse rough surfaces. \n\nNevertheless, the GDOES technique offers a low-cost and rapid analysis with high \n\nsensitivity (1-10 ppm), high depth resolution (nm) and a possibility to measure all \n\nelements including the light ones (H, B, Li etc.).  \n\nElectrochemical techniques \n\nTypical electrochemical measurements are performed in electrochemical cells \n\nwhich can contain two or more electrodes. In the simplest cell, the potential difference is \n\nmeasured between two electrodes, namely the working electrode and the counter one. \n\nMain drawback of this type of electrochemical cell is the lack of precise control of the \n\nworking electrode potential. The problem can be solved by entering additional (third) \n\nelectrode, so-called the reference electrode. The third electrode has a constant potential \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n70 \n\n \n\nand the potential difference is measured between the working and the reference electrode \n\n(in contrast to the two-electrode cell) that allows to make precise potential changes. \n\nDuring electrochemical measurements, it is impossible to control the current and \n\nthe potential simultaneously. Therefore, only two basic experiments can be performed: \n\nwhen the potential is controlled while the current is measured and, the opposite, when the \n\npotential is measured while current is controlled. The most known electrochemical \n\ntechniques are presented in Figure II. 3. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II. 3 Family tree of interfacial electrochemical techniques  \n\n(taken from Harvey [7, 8]). \n\n \n\nOnly two electrochemical techniques from the list, namely voltammetry and \n\nchronoamperometry were applied in this PhD work, because they are the main methods \n\nto study the electrode kinetics. It is possible to obtain information about nature of \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n71 \n\n \n\nelectrode processes, based on the shape of curves and the shape changing in different \n\nsolutions, temperature and other physico-chemical parameters [9, 10]. \n\nOne of the most widely used technique is voltammetry. The method consists in \n\napplication of a continuously time-varying potential to the working electrode and \n\nregistration of the corresponding current.  \n\nIn the electrochemical system, the resulting current contains faradaic and \n\nnonfaradaic parts. The most important example of nonfaradaic part is current of the EDL \n\ncharging. This small current depends on the potential value due to reorganization of the \n\nEDL structure [8]. \n\nThe faradaic current appears as a result of redox reactions on the electrode which \n\nmostly occur under polarization. Polarization is necessary for equilibrium changing in the \n\nsystem. The relationship between the electrode potential (E) and the equilibrium \n\nconcentration of ions is described by the Nernst equation: \n\n \n\n? = ?0 +  \n??\n\n??\nln (\n\n???\n\n????\n)  (II.3) \n\n \n\nwhere E0 is standard potential (V), R \u2013 universal gas constant (8.314 J K-1 mol-1), T \u2013 \n\ntemperature (K), F \u2013 Faraday constant (96485 C mol-1), n \u2013 number of moles of electrons \n\ntransferred in the reaction, ?red/ox is a chemical activity for the relevant species (can be \n\nsimplified by replacing for concentration of the species) [8, 11].  \n\nIt is obvious from equation II.3 that any changes in E result in changing the \n\nconcentration ratio (?ox/?red) of the species on the electrode interface according to the \n\nscheme: \n\n \n\nOx + ne = Red  (II.4) \n\n \n\nThis particular electrons flow appears in the I(E) curve as a current. There are two \n\nmain factors influencing the current density during the electrochemical experiments, \n\nnamely mass-transport and kinetics of the electron transfer. The charge-transfer rate can \n\nbe enhanced by applying potential until the moment, when the mass-transport becomes a \n\nlimiting factor. The mass-transport is contributed by three independent mechanisms: \n\nmigration, convection and diffusion. The driving forces are electric field in solution, \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n72 \n\n \n\nexternal energy (for example mechanical stirring) and chemical potential caused by \n\nconcentration gradient, correspondingly [11].  \n\nThe cyclic voltammetry (CVA) is a particular case of voltammetry. It is a very \n\npowerful technique for initial analysis of the system and occurring processes. As it was \n\ntold by E. Gileady: \u201cCyclic voltammetry should always be the first experiment performed \n\nin a new system, but never the last\u201d [11]. The advantage of the CVA, in comparison with \n\nthe linear sweep voltammetry, is that scan of the potential is performed in both directions. \n\nIt gives an opportunity to investigate species generated on the electrode. [7, 8, 11].  \n\nAdditional information about electrochemical processes in the systems studied in \n\nthe current work was obtained from the chronoamperometry measurements, where the \n\npotential was kept constant and the current response was studied. In particular, this \n\ntechnique has been used for determination of the nucleation mechanism, critical size of \n\nthe nuclei, nucleation rate and also for quantification of the deposit amount using the \n\nFaraday equation (V.2) [9, 10]. \n\nReferences \n\n[1] W.

For the first time, the electrodeposition \n\nfrom an ionic liquid is performed in a porous alumina template, anodically grown on the \n\naluminium substrate without complete removal of the barrier layer. The two-step process \n\nwas applied; first, with alternating-current pulse nucleation of zinc nanoparticles on the \n\nbottom of the pores, followed by direct-current growth of the rods. The electrolyte \n\nconsisted of 0.5M ZnCl2 in choline chloride and ethylene glycol in a 1:2 molar ratio. The \n\nresulting zinc nanorods are approximately 3 \u00b5m in length and 70 nm in diameter. The \n\nachieved fill factor of the pores is in the 70\u201380% range. \n\nKeywords: anodic alumina, electrodeposition, ionic liquid, nanorods, porous \n\ntemplate. \n\nIntroduction \n\nIn recent years, 1D nanostructured metal materials, such as nanowires and \n\nnanorods, have attracted more and more attention, owing to their applications and uses in \n\nphotonics [1], nanoelectronics [2], catalysis, sensors [3], and so forth. Metallic nanorods \n\nhave been intensively studied for potential use in the fields of high-density data storage \n\n[4] and biosensing [5]. The deposition of metallic nanorods into pores with a dielectric \n\nbarrier layer has also opened new perspectives for the development of metal\u2013dielectric\u2013\n\nmetal subwavelength plasmonic waveguides [6, 7] and, specifically, the one-end-sealed \n\nmetal\u2013insulator\u2013metal waveguides [8] when the bottom of the pore is sealed by a \n\ndielectric material. Metallic nanorods can be considered as precursors for various \n\ninorganic compounds after relevant post-treatment. For example, metallic zinc \n\nnanomaterials can be converted to the semiconducting oxide or sulfide forms, keeping \n\nthe original shape [9]. \n\nElectrodeposition into porous templates is a relatively simple and cheap method \n\nfor the synthesis of metallic nanomaterials [10-13]. However, the uniform \n\nelectrodeposition of metals into the pores from conventional water-based electrolytes is \n\noften complicated by number of limiting factors. The electrochemical window of water \n\nis rather limited, and hydrogen evolution can occur in parallel to the reduction of metal \n\ncations. It is especially critical when the pores in the template demonstrate a different \n\ngeometry and different local iR drops. Thus, the real applied potential can vary from pore \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n76 \n\n \n\nto pore, causing hydrogen generation in the wider ones. The issue of hydrogen evolution \n\ncan affect the deposited material if the hydrogen is dissolved in the nanorods. This process \n\ncan also cause blocking of the pores, because of the formation of gas bubbles or through \n\nsecondary effects in electrolyte, owing to local alkalinization [14]. \n\nElectrosynthesis from ionic liquids becomes attractive, owing to the unique \n\nproperties of these electrolytes [15]. Ionic liquids demonstrate significantly wider \n\nelectrochemical windows and higher thermal stability than standard electrolytes. \n\nUtilization of ionic liquids also allows electrosynthesis of active metallic materials, which \n\nare impossible in aqueous electrolytes. Several types of metallic nanorods have recently \n\nbeen obtained through electrodeposition from ionic liquid into porous polycarbonate and \n\noxide templates [16-18]. The electrodeposition of free-standing zinc nanowires from an \n\nionic liquid has also been reported recently [19]. The zinc nanostructures were grown in \n\nthe pores of track-etched polycarbonate membranes, which contained a sputtered metallic \n\nlayer, closing the end of the pores from one side and ensuring electrical contact. In the \n\ncase of well-ordered nanostructures, the track-etched membranes cannot be employed, \n\nbecause of the random distribution of pores. The oxide templates are usually used in such \n\nsituations. These templates are normally prepared as free-standing membranes with the \n\nbarrier layer removed, and a metallic film is sputtered on the back side to establish an \n\neffective electrical contact by using a multistage complex process [20]. To the best of our \n\nknowledge, direct electrodeposition from ionic liquids into alumina templates without the \n\nremoval of the barrier layer has not yet been reported. \n\nThe main aim of this work was to directly electrodeposit metallic nanorods from \n\ndeep eutectic solvents into a porous anodic alumina template on aluminum substrates \n\nwithout the removal of the barrier layer. Zinc is used herein as a model system for growing \n\nthe nanorods. Until now, no successful electrodeposition of zinc has been proven in this \n\ntype of template. Moreover, zinc was selected here because of the ease of possible \n\nsulfurization or oxidation post-treatments, which can confer an ordered array of \n\nsemiconductive nanorods. The obtained results can also be transferred to other metallic \n\nsystems, especially those that are hard to electrodeposit from waterbased solutions. \n\nA two stage AC/DC process, recently suggested for aqueous electrolytes [21], was \n\nemployed in this work aiming at uniform filling of the pores with metal. In this paper, \n\ndeposition of relatively noble metals such as copper, silver, and cobalt was shown. Zinc \n\ndeposition from aqueous electrolytes was also tried, but without convincing proof of \n\nmetallic zinc deposition. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n77 \n\n \n\nExperimental \n\nThe annealed aluminium (99.0%) foil was used for preparation of porous \n\ntemplate. The substrate was mechanically polished (down to grid 4000) followed by the \n\nchemical polishing in a mixture of phosphoric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid at 70-90oC. \n\nFinally, the samples were washed with acetone, ethanol and distilled water, and then dried \n\nin air.  \n\nTwo-step anodization of the samples was used in order to form a well-ordered \n\nalumina template [22]. The first anodization step was performed at constant potential of \n\n40 V in oxalic acid (0.3M) for 1 hour at temperature about 3\u00b0C. The pre-structured \n\naluminum surface was obtained after dissolution of the formed oxide in a mixture of \n\nphosphoric acid and CrO3 at 70-80\u00b0C for 5 minutes. The second anodization stage was \n\nperformed at similar condition as the first one with potential drop from 40V to 0V with \n\nsweep rate 1.3V min-1 after 30 or 60 minutes of potentiostatic polarization. Post-\n\nanodization wall thinning was carried out in 0.3M (COOH)2 at 40\noC for 2.5 hours \n\nresulting in formation of the template with a pore size of 70 nm and wall thickness \n\nbetween the pores in the range of 15-20 nm. The obtained template had 3\u00b5m and 1.3\u00b5m \n\npore length (by SEM measurements) for 60 min and 30 min anodization respectively.  \n\nPreparation of the ionic liquid electrolyte and following electrodeposition \n\nexperiments were held in air. Eutectic solution was prepared by adding 0.5M of \n\nanhydrous zinc chloride (99.99%) to the mixture of choline chloride (98%) and ethylene \n\nglycol (99+%) in the molar ratio 1:2. Then the mixture was heated to 60\u00b0C and kept at \n\nthis temperature in vacuum during 24 hours in order to dry the electrolyte. \n\nElectrochemical studies were performed employing a Bio-Logic SAS SP-300 \n\npotentiostat using a two electrode cell with graphite rod as a counter electrode. \n\nMicroscopic investigations were carried out using Hitachi S-4100 scanning electron \n\nmicroscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray diffraction \n\n(XRD) data of the samples were obtained employing a PANalytical X\u2019Pert PRO \n\ndiffractometer (Bragg-Brentano geometry, CuK?-radiation). \n\nResults and discussion \n\nA uniform electrodeposition of Zn nanorods in the porous alumina template with \n\nthin barrier layer is not possible in DC mode. The potentiostatic polarization leads to high \n\ndrop of potential across the barrier film. Therefore the electrochemical reduction of the \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n78 \n\n \n\nmetal cations occurs only in some defective zones causing formation of large unordered \n\nlumps which are growing through porous oxide while most of the pores stay unfilled. The \n\ndissolution of alumina in the studied ionic liquid does not occur as observed by \n\nelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (not shown). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III. 1 a) Typical shapes of voltage/current pulses applied during the first \n\nnucleation stage; b) and c) cross-sectional SEM micrographs obtained after first \n\nstage pulsed electrodeposition from 0.5M ZnCl2 in 1ChCl:2EG for 10 and 30 min \n\nrespectively. \n\nAnother strategy based on high-frequency pulsed electrodeposition with \n\nasymmetric pulse modulation was employed. The idea was to apply higher frequencies at \n\nwhich the impedance modulus of the system decreases at least below 103 Ohm cm-2 in \n\norder to achieve a reasonable current density. The desirable values of the impedance are \n\nachieved at frequencies above 10 Hz. Therefore the electrodeposition was performed at \n\n50, 100 and 200 Hz in order to find an optimal frequency for uniform filling of the pores. \n\nThe application of highest frequency (200 Hz) leads to formation of unordered deposits \n\non top of the oxide without filling the pores. This fact can be caused by relatively low \n\nimpedance of the total system including barrier and porous part at such frequencies. Thus \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n79 \n\n \n\nno preferential deposition into pores can be achieved. No clear filling of pores was also \n\nobserved using 50 Hz perturbation. The optimal electrodeposition of Zn was achieved at \n\n100 Hz as described below.  \n\nA non-symmetric pulsed AC signal with the shape shown in Figure III. 1 was \n\napplied. The signal was composed by the -9V \u2013 +5V sin-wave with total duration (t \n\nreduction + t oxidation) equal to 10 ms. 100 ms off time was kept between the pulses. \n\nThe strong reduction potential applied to the anodized electrode leads to \u2018bridging\u2019 the \n\nbarrier oxide layer. The integral impedance modulus of the oxide film decreases at such \n\npolarizations by several orders of magnitude (not shown) and make deposition in the \n\npores possible. The anodic part of the pulse partially dissolves the deposited Zn. At the \n\nbeginning of the electrodeposition a high Zn electrodeposition current and relatively low \n\nZn dissolution current are observed. The reduction/oxidation charge ratio is 4 during the \n\nperiod from 120s to 180s. With time the ratio decreases and achieves values close to 1 \n\nafter about 6000s (Figure III. 1). The situation when reduction current is equal to the \n\noxidation one leads to situation when the amount of electrodeposited zinc is equal to the \n\namount of metal dissolved at anodic part of the wave. The steady state is achieved and \n\nthe growth of zinc particles terminates.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III. 2 Chronopotentiometric curve obtained at galvanostatic \n\nelectrodeposition at 5 mA/cm2. The insets show SEM top-view of the sample after \n\ndifferent times of galvanostatic polarization. \n\nThe zinc nanoparticles are formed at the bottom of all pores as a result of the \n\npulsed electrodeposition during 10 minutes (Figure III. 1 b). The nanoparticles do not \n\ngrow significantly when longer pulsed polarization is applied (Figure III. 1 c) since the \n\nsteady state conditions are achieved.  \n\nA second galvanostatic step with 5 mA/cm2 current density was applied to drive \n\nfurther growth of zinc nanorods inside the pores. Figure III. 2 demonstrates a \n\nchronopotentiometric curve during the galvanostatic electrodeposition. The initial \n\npotential at this stage had value of -4.1V and becomes less negative with time showing \n\nthat electrochemical reduction process is initiated at the bottom of pores. The potential \n\nvalue demonstrates a sharp change in the beginning followed by a lower slope \n\ntransformed with time into a plateau-like zone on the curve. This behaviour is associated \n\nwith a steady state electrodeposition process controlled by the diffusion of metallic \n\ncations into the pores. The continuous slow decrease of polarization is caused by the \n\ndecrease of the diffusion path of cations from the bulk electrolyte to the metal surface in \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n81 \n\n \n\npores because of continuous filling of the pores with metallic Zn. The uniform filling of \n\nthe pores can be observed at this stage (left inset on Figure III. 2) leading to the situation \n\nwhen zinc nanorods reach the surface of template and begin to fuse because of started \n\nmultidirectional growth (middle inset on Figure III. 2). The next stage is formation of \n\nbulky deposits over whole surface with consequent drop of polarization (Figure III. 2) \n\nbecause of increased electroactive surface (Figure III. 2).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III. 3 Cross-sectional SEM micrograph of porous alumina template filled \n\nwith zinc after two-stage electrochemical deposition. \n\nFigure III. 3 shows cross-sectional SEM image of the sample after the complete 2 \n\nsteps of the deposition. Uniform complete filling of the pores with zinc nanorods of 3 \u00b5m \n\nlength and 70 nm in diameter is observed. The XRD data (not shown) indicate that the \n\nphase appeared in the anodic template as a result of the deposition is metallic zinc. It also \n\ndoes not show any signs of post-oxidation. At least no respective crystalline products are \n\nobserved.  \n\nConclusions \n\nThe zinc nanorods were deposited from ZnCl2/ChCl:EG ionic deep eutectic \n\nsolvents into porous anodic alumina template without removal the barrier layer. A two-\n\nstep electrodeposition pr ocess was developed with pulsed AC pre-deposition nucleation \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n82 \n\n \n\nstage followed by the galvanostatic growth. Highly uniform filling of the pores was \n\nachieved resulting in formation of nanorods with reproducible geometrical parameters. \n\nThe method allows fabrication of highly-ordered metal-dielectric nanoassemblies \n\nutilizing fully wet and simple template preparation method as well as non-expensive ionic \n\nliquids with low sensitivity to humidity. \n\n  \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n83 \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe financial support of the European Commission and Portuguese Foundation \n\nfor Science and Technology (FCT) in frame of PIRSES-GA-2011-295273 \u2013 NANEL and \n\nPTDC/CTM-NAN/113570/2009 projects, respectively, is gratefully acknowledged. \n\nReferences: \n\n[1] V.

In this paper, zinc \n\nelectrodeposition from a solution of ZnCl2 in a choline chloride / ethylene glycol eutectic \n\nmixture on dense alumina layers of different thicknesses was studied. In a potentiostatic \n\nregime, the deposition on a barrier layer was found to be hardly possible even when the \n\nlayer is a native alumina film (about 2 nm thick). Choline and ethylene glycol form an \n\nadsorbed stable layer at the alumina/electrolyte interface and thereby block the access of \n\nzinc chloride anions to the electrode. \n\nIt has been shown that zinc can be directly deposited on a barrier layer by means \n\nof application of a combined potential mode in which an AC component of 50 mV \n\nsuperimposed on the DC potential of -1.6 V. Increasing the temperature of the eutectic \n\nsolution allows zinc electrodeposition in a potentiostatic regime already at 50oC. By \n\napplication of any of these conditions, zinc can be deposited on a barrier alumina layer \n\nup to about 60 nm thick. The range of frequencies of the AC component and the \n\ntemperature range where the deposition is optimal were considered. The mechanism of \n\nunblocking of the electrode by the alternating potential and by the temperature rise has \n\nbeen suggested.  \n\nKeywords: barrier alumina layer, deep eutectic solvent, choline chloride, \n\nelectrochemical deposition \n\nIntroduction \n\nIn the last decade the high-ordered porous templates of anodic aluminium oxide \n\n(AAO) have widely been used for preparation of 1-D nanostructures [1]. Nanorods and \n\nother nanostructures are produced using electrochemical deposition that is the most \n\nconventional and cheap method. However, there is a limitation for application of AAO \n\ntemplates that arises from the presence of a barrier layer at the bottom of pores. The \n\nalumina film formed as a result of anodization or immediate oxidation of aluminium acts \n\nas a high resistive medium impairing the flow of current.  \n\nGenerally, a detached AAO membrane (free AAO) with sputtered metallic contact \n\nis used for electrofilling of the pores [2-4]. A multi-stage process of removal of both \n\nsubstrate and the barrier layer followed by contact deposition is typically applied [5]. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n88 \n\n \n\nBoth stages are time-consuming, require expensive equipment and have a poor \n\nscalability. In this respect, preparation of 1-D nanostructures by means of direct \n\ndeposition in pores AAO template has a good practical potential. The method is much \n\ncheaper and faster than a deposition using a detached membrane. A number of ways to \n\nthin the barrier layer have been reported. The decrease of potential at the end of anodizing \n\nprocess [6-8] and dissolution of the oxide layer are the most promising of them. \n\nUnfortunately, the layer cannot be completely removed by any of these methods, and \n\nresults in difficulties in electrochemical deposition into pores. The direct growth of \n\nnanostructured materials on barrier alumina layers opens new possibilities, as to create \n\ndifferent metal-insulator-metal and metal-insulator-semiconductor devices, which can be \n\nused as sub-wavelength plasmonic waveguides [9, 10] and supercapacitors [11, 12].  \n\nIt is well-known that ionic liquids (ILs) demonstrate a number of important \n\nproperties such as negligible vapour pressure, wide electrochemical window and high \n\nthermal stability [13]. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have similar properties but, in \n\ncontrast to the conventional ILs, DESs are much cheaper, non-toxic, water-/ air- stable, \n\nand therefore have a good potential for use in industrial scale [14]. Abbott et al. have \n\nwidely studied properties of DESs based on choline chloride namely viscosity and \n\nconductivity [15, 16]. Electrodeposition of metals [17, 18] and particularly zinc [19-24] \n\nand Zn-containing alloys [25] from these solvents was explored as well. \n\nIn our previous work [26], we formed zinc nanorods in an AAO template through \n\nzinc electrodeposition from DES based on choline chloride. Zinc was chosen as a model \n\nmetal for deposition due to possibility of subsequent transformation into semiconductor \n\nmaterials such as zinc oxide and zinc sulphide [27]. It is known that the use of DES \n\nprevents a chemical destruction of the barrier which is typical for acidic/basic aqueous \n\nelectrolytes. An ordered porous template was prepared by anodization of aluminium \n\nsubstrate without complete removal of the barrier layer. A two-step process was used; \n\npulse nucleation of zinc nanoparticles on the bottom of the pores followed by a growth of \n\nthe rods in a potentiostatic mode. Application of the alternating current [28] (AC) stage \n\nin the beginning of the process allowed us to deposit zinc in presence of the barrier [26]. \n\nIt has been demonstrated that electrofilling of an AAO template without removal of the \n\nbarrier layer is also feasible as well in aqueous electrolytes [29, 30]. An AC mode method \n\nor a pulse deposition [31] were shown to be the most promising methods in this respect. \n\nHowever, no systematic study of electrodeposition over an aluminium oxide layer has \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n89 \n\n \n\nbeen reported. The mechanisms of nucleation at the bottom of pores are also not fully \n\nunderstood. \n\nThe study of nucleation processes in porous templates is not easy because of the \n\nfact that the interface is buried. Besides, the diffusion limitations in the pores can create \n\ninterfering effects. In this respect, electrodeposition on flat samples allows to avoid these \n\nlimitations and can serve as an appropriate model process for such study. This work aims \n\nat investigating ways of zinc electrodeposition from DES based on choline chloride over \n\nbarrier alumina layers in terms of temperature, oxide layer thickness, and potential profile \n\napplied. Effects of Zn deposition using a potentiostatic (PS) regime and a PS regime \n\nmodified with a small alternating potential (AC-PS) were considered.  \n\nExperimental \n\nCoupons of aluminium foil (10?5?0.2mm, 99.990%, Goodfellow) and Fluorine \n\ndoped Tin Oxide (FTO) glass (Sigma-Aldrich) were used for template preparation. Part \n\nof their surface was isolated with varnish, giving an electrode working area of about 0.5 \n\ncm2. Before anodization, the metallic electrodes were chemically polished in a mixture of \n\nphosphoric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid at 70-90oC. Finally, the samples were rinsed with \n\nacetone, ethanol and distilled water, and then dried in air. \n\nPreparation of anodized samples \n\nA Keithley 237 High Voltage Source-Measure Unit was used as a current source \n\nfor sample oxidation. A 0.1 M ammonium pentaborate aqueous solution served as \n\nelectrolyte. A two-step anodization procedure was applied at room temperature. The first \n\nanodization step was performed in a galvanostatic mode with a current density of 1 \n\nmA/cm2. Platinum foil was used as counter electrode. The process was terminated after \n\nthe desired voltage (10, 20, 40 V) was achieved. The second anodization step was done \n\nin a potentiostatic regime at the same voltages during 10 min. After the two steps of \n\nanodization the electrodes were stored in a desiccator for stabilization of the compact \n\nalumina layer.  \n\nOxide layer thickness measurements \n\nThickness of the layers was measured by Electrochemical Impedance \n\nSpectroscopy (EIS) and Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES).  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n90 \n\n \n\nThe EIS measurements were performed using a Gamry FAS2 Femtostat with a \n\nPCI4 Controller over a 105 \u2013 10-2 Hz frequency range with a step of 7 points per decade. \n\nImpedance spectra were recorded applying a 10 mV (rms) sinusoidal perturbation at open \n\ncircuit potential. The measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell (consisting \n\nof a Mercury/Mercury sulphate reference electrode, a platinum foil as the counter \n\nelectrode and the working electrode with an area of 0.5 cm2). All measurements were \n\nperformed in the Faraday cage to avoid interferences with external electromagnetic fields. \n\nA 0.1 M ammonium pentaborate aqueous solution was the working electrolyte. The \n\nimpedance plots were fitted using the Echem Analyst software from Gamry Inc. All \n\nspectra were successfully fitted using a parallel R-C network. \n\nGDOES depth profile analysis of the coatings was completed using a HORIBA \n\nGD-Profiler 2 with an anode of 4 mm in diameter and operating at a pressure of 650 Pa \n\nand a power of 10 W. \n\nBoth EIS and GDOES methods gave the same thickness values (Table IV. 1).  \n\nTable IV. 1 Thickness of the barrier alumina layers \n\nVoltage Thickness \n\n0 V 2 nm \n\n10 V 15 nm \n\n20 V 27 nm \n\n40 V 54 nm \n\nElectrodeposition study \n\nPreparation of DES electrolytes and the electrodeposition experiments were done \n\nin air atmosphere. The eutectic system was prepared by mixing choline chloride (ChCl, \n\n98%) and ethylene glycol (EG, 99+%) in the molar ratio of 1:2. Anhydrous zinc chloride \n\n(99.99%) was added to the DES to obtain a 0.1 M solution which was then heated and \n\nkept at 60 \u00b0C under vacuum during 24 h. As-prepared solution (hereafter DES:Zn) was \n\neither used for electrodeposition or stored in desiccator over P2O5. \n\nCyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained using a Bio-Logic SAS SP-300 \n\npotentiostat. Measurements were performed in a Faraday cage. A three-electrode cell \n\nconsisting of a platinum wire as reference electrode, graphite rod as counter electrode and \n\nthe working electrode was used. All cyclic voltammetric curves were recorded starting in \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n91 \n\n \n\nthe cathodic direction. The potential scan rate was 0.1 V/s in all potentiodynamic \n\nexperiments. \n\nInvestigations of electrode surface morphology and elemental analysis were \n\nperformed using a Hitachi S-4100 scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with \n\nenergy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). An ImageJ 1.48v image processing software was \n\napplied for calculation of the electrode areas covered by the deposited zinc. \n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker IFS55 \n\nspectrometer equipped with a single horizontal Golden Gate attenuated total reflectance \n\n(ATR) cell.  \n\nResults and discussion \n\nElectrodeposition of zinc in potentiostatic (PS) regime  \n\nInitially, zinc electrodeposition from DES:Zn on an electrode with a good \n\nconductivity for characterization of electrochemical properties of the system was tested. \n\nTypical CV recorded on a FTO electrode in a blank DES as a background solution is \n\nshown in Figure IV. 1 (dotted line). No electrochemical process is observed in the \n\npotential range from 0 to -2 V. Such a wide electrochemical window suggests feasibility \n\nof zinc deposition from a Zn-containing DES. Then, the experiments were performed in \n\nDES:Zn. It is seen from Figure IV. 1 (solid line) that a cathodic current appears at about \n\n-1.4 V. Further increase of the cathodic potential leads to onset of a reduction process that \n\ncan be associated with deposition of metallic zinc. Indeed, appearance and growth of a \n\nzinc layer were observed. The obtained CVs are typical for 3D nucleation followed by \n\ndiffusion limited growth. Similar CVs were previously reported for the case of Zn \n\nelectrodeposition from DES on the different templates [22-24] The anodic process \n\nresponsible for zinc dissolution was detected in the reverse potential scan at -1.25 V. The \n\nforward-reverse scan after the reduction peak demonstrates a current loop that is typical \n\nfor the nucleation process, with overpotential of 0.15 V.  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n92 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 1 Cyclic voltammetric curves recorded on an FTO coated glass electrode \n\nin blank Ch:EG DES and in DES:Zn. Notice the difference between the y-axis scales \n\nin the main plot and the inset. \n\nIt was observed that zinc electrodeposition from DES:Zn on FTO glass at -1.4 V \n\nresulted in an island-type metallic layer (3D nucleation) with poor adhesion. When \n\ndeposition was undertaken at -2 V, gas evolution accompanying zinc reduction was \n\ndetected. Hence, both potentials, -1.4 and -2 V, turned out to be not suitable for the \n\ncompact zinc deposition. A mirror-like, solid zinc coating with a strong adhesion was \n\nobtained at -1.6 V. Therefore this value was used then as a base potential in all deposition \n\nexperiments. \n\nZinc electrodeposition on aluminium surface with a native alumina film was \n\nexpected to be different from that on FTO glass due to the presence of barrier layer. \n\nIndeed, the cathodic current at -1.4 V was much smaller (Figure IV. 2) as compared with \n\nthat on FTO electrode at the same potential value (Figure IV. 1). Keeping the potential at \n\n-1.6 V for 30 min, zinc was not deposited on the electrode surface. (Figure IV. 3 A). \n\nElectrodeposition at -2 V and even at -5 V was tried as well. Intense gas evolution was \n\nobserved but no metallic zinc on the electrode surface was found. It was shown in \n\nliterature that trimethylamine [32, 33], hydrogen [24] as well as (in minor amounts) \n\nchloromethane, dichloromethane and chloroform [32] are the most likely gaseous \n\nproducts of cathodic reduction of DES based on ChCl.  \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 2 Cyclic voltammetric curves recorded on aluminium electrode with \n\nnative alumina film in blank Ch:EG DES and in DES:Zn. \n\nThese results suggested that the failure in the electrodeposition comes from large \n\npotential drop at the interface although other electrochemical processes could occur. \n\nIt has been reported that the DES components can form layers on an electrode \n\nsurface [34-36]. Structure and composition of such a layer evidently depend on chemical \n\nnature of both DES and material of electrode. Based on the research conducted in \n\nChCl:EG DESs, it has been suggested that the organic layer is formed by ethylene glycol \n\nmolecules. However, one should notice that the above mentioned studies were performed \n\nusing the electrodes that are free of oxide films, namely Au, Pt, Hg, and glassy carbon. \n\nCharacteristics of the organic layer formed by DES components on an electrode with \n\noxide film can differ from that formed on a pure metal (or carbon) electrode. Likely \n\nvariations in composition and/or structure of such a layer can be also caused by the oxide \n\nfilm thickness and density. For example, in the case of aluminium electrode, the alumina \n\nfilm can be considered as either dielectric or semiconductor depending on thickness and \n\ndefect concentration. Moreover, due to specificity of the oxidation mechanism, the oxide \n\nfilm on an aluminium surface is chemically inhomogeneous. The outer interface of such \n\na film is rich in oxygen [37] that certainly favours formation of bonds with organic species \n\nthat have OH groups as a constituent. In DES:Zn, such species are choline (Ch cation) \n\nand ethylene glycol (EG molecule). Therefore, Ch and EG seem to be likely species able \n\nto form a layer structure on the alumina/electrolyte interface (Figure IV. 4 A). Moreover, \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n94 \n\n \n\nthese organic species are able to create strong hydrogen bonds among themselves thereby \n\nmaking the layer structure more stable.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 3 SEM images of aluminium electrode surface with native alumina film \n\nafter zinc deposition from DES:Zn in a PS mode (A) and after the deposition an AC-\n\nPS mode at 1 kHz (B). SEM image of aluminium electrode with a 15 nm anodic film \n\nafter zinc deposition in an AC-PS mode at 1 kHz (C). The EDS spectrum recorded \n\nfrom the sample surface after zinc deposition in an AC-PS mode (15 nm anodic film, \n\n1 kHz) (D). The deposition time was 30 min. \n\nIt has been found by Abbott et al. [25, 34] that zinc in DES:Zn exists in an anionic \n\nform as ZnCl4\n2-. Therefore application of a constant cathodic potential lowers \n\nconcentration of zinc in a vicinity of the alumina/DES:Zn interface. In ZnCl4\n2-, zinc is \n\ncoordinated by four chlorines forming a tetrahedron with the minimal dimension of ~0.7 \n\nnm. Such a big ion can hardly pass through the stable layer of organic species on the \n\nelectrode. As a result, in a PS regime, no zinc deposition occurs (Figure IV. 4 B).  \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 4 Stable layer structured of choline / ethylene glycol on the electrode \n\nsurface in absence of potential (A) and at constant potential (PS mode) (B). \n\nDestabilization of the layer as a result of application of an AC-PS mode (C) or/and \n\nincreasing temperature (D). \n\nInfrared spectroscopy study  \n\nNature of the organic layer formed in DES:Zn on aluminium electrode with barrier \n\nalumina film and its characteristic features as compared with such a layer on a noble metal \n\nelectrode were studied using infrared spectroscopy. FTIR-ATR spectrum of DES:Zn in \n\ncontact with platinum electrode is in Figure IV. 5. The respective spectra of blank DES:Zn \n\nand blank platinum are shown for comparison. The observed bands in the DES:Zn spectra \n\ncorrelate well with the reference spectroscopic data for ethylene glycol and choline \n\nchloride. One can see that contact of DES:Zn with platinum surface results in no shift of \n\nthe bands characteristic of the blank DES:Zn spectrum thereby suggesting that no \n\nchemical bonds between the organic species and platinum electrode form.  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n96 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 5 FTIR-ATR spectra of platinum surface, blank DES:Zn and platinum \n\nsurface in contact with DES:Zn. \n\nPrior to the infrared spectroscopy study, aluminium electrode with a 15 nm anodic \n\nalumina layer was immersed in DES:Zn for 5 min, rinsed in distilled water and then dried \n\nin nitrogen gas flow. For comparison, an electrode with as-prepared (blank) 15 nm \n\nalumina layer and an electrode with the 15 nm layer in contact with DES:Zn were studied \n\nas well. Figure IV. 6 represents the respective FTIR-ATR spectra. The only band at about \n\n1000 cm-1 associated with longitudinal optical vibrations of the Al-O bonds in alumina is \n\nseen in the blank alumina spectrum [38]. In the spectra of the alumina films either in \n\ncontact with DES:Zn or after the 5 min immersion in DES:Zn, in addition to this band, \n\nthe modes that are characteristic of the infrared spectrum of this eutectic solution are \n\nobserved, although less intense. In blank DES:Zn, the mode that corresponds to the O-H \n\nstretching in alcohols is observed at 3310 cm-1, while the same mode for alumina after \n\nimmersion in this eutectic solution is at 3445 cm-1 (Inset A in Figure IV. 6). Such a shift \n\nin the mode position suggests some interaction between OH groups of the organic species \n\nin DES and defect outer surface of the anodic alumina film. This shift is considered to \n\nindicate the formation of a layer of adsorbed organic species on the alumina film surface. \n\nIn the spectrum of alumina in contact with DES:Zn, the O-H stretching mode is also \n\nshifted in comparison with that of the blank DES:Zn and it is centered at 3357 cm-1. We \n\nconsider that this band has the contribution of the respective modes of both adsorbed \n\nspecies and free species, and the contribution from the former is definitely smaller than \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n97 \n\n \n\nthat from the latter. Hence, the band position for the alumina in contact with DES:Zn is \n\nclose to that for the blank DES:Zn.  \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 6 FTIR-ATR spectra of blank DES:Zn, blank anodic alumina film, \n\nanodic alumina film after a 5 min immersion in DES:Zn and anodic alumina film in \n\ncontact with DES:Zn. Magnified areas of the spectra in the ranges of 2500-4000 cm-\n\n1 (A) and 1000-1600 cm-1 (B). \n\nThe modes associated with C-O vibrations in blank DES:Zn (at 1083 and 1036 \n\ncm-1) are shifted to 1089 and 1041 cm-1, respectively, in DES:Zn in contact with alumina \n\n(Inset B in Figure IV. 6). As regards the modes related to C-H vibrations that are present \n\nin the spectra as well, changes in their positions were found to be below the experimental \n\nerror. This suggests that the interaction between the alumina surface and choline / \n\nethylene glycol occurs through OH groups of these organic species.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n98 \n\n \n\nElectrodeposition of zinc in AC-PS regime  \n\nZinc electrodeposition in the AC-PS regime was studied using the anodized \n\nsamples with a 15 nm alumina layer. A sinusoidal potential of 50 mV amplitude was \n\nsuperposed on above the DC potential of -1.6 V at the following frequencies: 1, 10, 10 \n\nHz; 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 kHz.  \n\nWe found out that blocking effect of the choline / ethylene glycol layer can be \n\ndiminished by application of such a combined potential. Indeed, zinc reduction was \n\ndetected in the frequency range of 1 Hz - 1 kHz. It was revealed from SEM/EDS study \n\nthat the observed isolated particles on the electrode surface are metallic zinc (Figure IV. \n\n3 B, C, and D). Both number and size of the particles were found to increase as the AC-\n\nPS frequency is increased from 1 Hz to 1 kHz. The maximal deposited zinc amount was \n\nobtained when electrodeposition was performed at 1 kHz (Figure IV. 7).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 7 Relative surface area of aluminium electrode with a 15 nm anodic \n\nalumina layer covered by the deposited zinc particles after electrodeposition in AC-\n\nPS mode at different frequencies of the alternating component of the applied \n\npotential. The deposition in the frequency range between 1 kHz and 2 kHz has not \n\nbeen explored. The lines are used to guide eyes. \n\nPeriodic variations of the potential are assumed to disturb the stationary state \n\nestablished in the vicinity of cathode as a result of application of the PS regime only. \n\nSpecifically, field-induced vibrations of polar choline cations make the respective organic \n\nlayer on the alumina/electrolyte interface less compact (Figure IV. 4 C). It opens a way \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n99 \n\n \n\nfor zinc chloride anions to reach the cathode followed by zinc reduction. Zinc deposition \n\nwas more efficient when the frequency of the alternating component was 1 kHz (Figure \n\nIV. 3 B, C and Figure IV. 7). When the frequency increases the relatively heavy choline \n\nions are not able to move substantially during the potential cycles. Thus, due to inertia of \n\nthe choline cations the respective layer keeps compact. Periodic variations of the applied \n\npotential with frequency of 2 kHz and above do not disturb the stationary state and zinc \n\ndeposition remains impossible.  \n\nEffect of temperature \n\nThe process of zinc electrodeposition on a barrier alumina layer was also studied \n\nas a function of the electrolyte temperature. Deposition experiments in the PS regime and \n\nAC-PS regime with the applied potentials of -1.6 V and -1.6 V overlaid with a sinusoidal \n\npotential of 50 mV at 1 kHz, respectively, on a 15 nm alumina layer at 25, 50, 75 and \n\n100oC were performed.  \n\nThe electrical properties of alumina layers before and after 30 min immersion in \n\nDES:Zn at each temperature was controlled by EIS. No significant change in EIS spectra \n\nof barrier layers has been observed. The high-frequency part of the spectra was found to \n\nbe the same for all samples regardless of the temperature.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 8 Cyclic voltammetric curves recorded on aluminium electrode with a 15 \n\nnm anodic alumina layer in DES:Zn at 25, 50, 75 and 100oC. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n100 \n\n \n\nIncreasing temperature was found to allow zinc electrodeposition from DES:Zn \n\neven in the potentiostatic regime. It is seen from the CV curves in Figure IV. 8 that already \n\nat 50?? a zinc oxidation peak appears and increases with temperature. Indeed, a PS \n\nelectrodeposition at 50oC resulted in formation of isolated particles of zinc on the \n\nelectrode surface while no deposit was detected in the same experiments at room \n\ntemperature (Figure IV. 9). It should be noticed that application of the alternating \n\ncomponent at this temperature still enhanced the deposition: the zinc coated area after \n\nAC-PS-mode deposition was almost two times larger than that when the PS regime was \n\nonly applied. However, at 100oC, the amount of the deposited zinc turned out to be the \n\nsame regardless of the deposition regime (either PS or AC-PS) used (Figure IV. 9).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 9 Relative surface area of aluminium electrode with a 15 nm anodic \n\nalumina layer covered by the deposited zinc particles after electrodeposition either \n\nin PS mode or in AC-PS mode at different temperatures. Solid lines are used to guide \n\neyes. \n\nTherefore, increasing temperature gives qualitatively the same result as that \n\ncaused by application of an alternating potential component. In fact, in both cases the zinc \n\ndeposition on a barrier alumina layer can be described using the same mechanism. \n\nVibrations of choline cations and ethylene glycol molecules, which make the blocking \n\nlayer of the organic species permeable to zinc chloride anions, can be induced both by \n\nalternating applied potential and by thermal agitation (Figure IV. 4 D).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n101 \n\n \n\nEffect of the alumina barrier layer thickness  \n\nEffect of the barrier layer thickness was studied at room temperature using either \n\nsamples with a native alumina film (~2 nm thick) or anodized samples with barrier layers \n\nof 15, 27 and 54 nm thick. Experiments were performed in the AC-PS regime at 1 kHz \n\nfor 30 min.  \n\nIt was found from SEM study that the morphology of the zinc particles and their \n\nquantity per unit area are approximately the same in cases of deposition on a native layer \n\nand on a 15 nm alumina layer. However, the particles deposited on the thicker layer were \n\nrather smaller. Therefore, one can suggest that the zinc nucleation rate was equal in both \n\ncases while the particle growth rate was bigger when zinc was deposited on a native layer. \n\nFigure IV. 10 shows the relative electrode area covered by zinc particles as a function of \n\nthe alumina layer thickness. One can see that the deposition rate decreases strongly when \n\ncrossing from a native alumina film to a 15 nm layer. Deposition on a 54 nm layer is still \n\npossible but with much smaller amount of zinc particles.  \n\n \n\nFigure IV. 10 Relative surface area of aluminium electrode either with native \n\nalumina layer or with anodic alumina layers of different thicknesses covered by the \n\ndeposited zinc particles after electrodeposition in AC-PS mode at 1 kHz. Solid lines \n\nare used to guide eyes. \n\nFurther experiments have revealed that zinc deposition on barrier layers is \n\npossible when frequency of the alternating component of the applied potential is within \n\nthe range of 1 Hz - 1 kHz regardless of the barrier layer thickness unless it exceeds ~60 \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n102 \n\n \n\nnm. The difficulty in depositing zinc on a thicker barrier layer is caused by increasing \n\nresistance of the layer. \n\nConclusions \n\nPotentiostatic deposition of zinc from a 0.1 M ZnCl2 solution in a choline \n\nchloride/ethylene glycol eutectic mixture on an alumina barrier layer at room temperature \n\nis impossible even if the layer thickness does not exceed ~2 nm (a native alumina film), \n\nalthough zinc is easily deposited at -1.4 V from the same solution on a FTO glass \n\nelectrode. In the case of deposition on alumina layers, the cathodic current is negligible \n\nat the same potential.  Intense gas evolution is observed when -2 V and higher potentials \n\nare applied but no zinc deposition occurs.  \n\nCholine and ethylene glycol adsorb on alumina surface. Due to interaction \n\nbetween OH groups of these organic species with the oxygen-reach outer part of the \n\nalumina film, stable layer structures in the alumina/electrolyte interface are formed which \n\nblock the access of zinc chloride anions to the cathode in a potentiostatic regime.  \n\nApplication of the potential of -1.6 V superimposed with alternating sinusoidal \n\ncomponent of 50 mV allows to deposit zinc both on native alumina film and on anodic \n\nlayers up to about 60 nm thick when the frequency of the alternating component is within \n\nthe range of 1 Hz - 1 kHz. Periodic variations of the potential disturb the stationary state \n\nof the choline cations making the respective organic layer in the alumina/electrolyte \n\ninterface less compact and permeable to zinc chloride anions. The deposition rate \n\ndecreases when the potential frequency is 2 kHz and above - relatively heavy organic \n\nspecies are not able to follow the cycling potential variations.  \n\nIncreasing the temperature has the same effect as the use of an alternating \n\ncomponent over the DC potential. Electrodeposition of zinc on a barrier layer at 100oC is \n\npossible even in potentiostatic regime.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n103 \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe financial support of the European Commission and Portuguese Foundation \n\nfor Science and Technology (FCT) in frame of the projects PIRSES-GA-2011-295273 \u2013 \n\nNANEL and PTDC/CTM-NAN/113570/2009, respectively, is gratefully acknowledged. \n\nReferences: \n\n[1] A.M.

It was shown that thin titanium dioxide layers work as high \n\nresistive media and the rate of zinc deposition decreases with film thickness. Thicker \n\ntitania layers (23 nm and higher) have opposite properties and the zinc reduction rate \n\nstarts gradually increasing with thickness. This happens because at the higher voltage \n\nnecessary to grow thicker anodic films they become more crystalline and consequently \n\nmore conductive. \n\nThere is also evidence that in deep eutectic solvent no dense organic layer forms \n\non the titanium/titania electrodes. The application of an AC signal superimposed on a DC \n\npotential only marginally increases the amount of zinc deposited and FTIR measurements \n\ndid not reveal the formation of any chemical bonds between the film and deep eutectic \n\nsolvent. \n\nZn deposition onto titanium/titania at -1.6V is characterised by instantaneous \n\nthree-dimensional nucleation mechanism, which is independent of the titania thickness. \n\nKeywords: Titanium oxide, deep eutectic solvent, zinc electrodeposition. \n\nIntroduction \n\nElectrochemical deposition is a conventional and cheap technique to form 1-D \n\nnanostructures. In most of the cases, porous anodic templates on the valve metals are \n\nused. Filling of the matrices by other materials is applied to produce solid state solar cells, \n\nphotodetectors, magnetic sensors, metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal capacitors [1] etc. The major \n\ndrawback of the porous anodic oxide templates is a barrier layer on the bottom of pores, \n\nwhich usually acts as a high resistive medium impairing the flow of current. \n\nDirect investigation of deposition and nucleation processes in porous templates is \n\nchallenging because the interface is hidden. Electrodeposition on flat samples allows to \n\navoid these limitations and can serve as an appropriate model process for such study. \n\nHowever extrapolation of results found on a bare metal electrode to the processes on the \n\nbottom of pores is incorrect because of critical differences between metal/electrolyte and \n\nbarrier oxide/electrolyte interfaces. Consequently, the use of a metallic electrode covered \n\nby the anodic oxide layer is one of the most convenient ways to study the bottom \n\nprocesses. In our previous work [2] zinc electrodeposition from a solution of ZnCl2 in a \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n108 \n\n \n\ncholine chloride / ethylene glycol eutectic mixture on dense alumina layers of different \n\nthicknesses was studied. It was shown that the potentiostatic deposition of zinc on an \n\nalumina barrier layer at -1.6V and room temperature is impossible even if the layer \n\nthickness does not exceed ~2 nm (a native alumina film). As a comparison, zinc is easily \n\ndeposited at -1.4 V from the same solution on a fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass \n\nelectrode. The formation of a dense organic layer due to interaction between OH groups \n\nof the organic species with the alumina film was demonstrated. Moreover deposition has \n\nbeen shown to be possible by superimposing an alternating sinusoidal voltage on DC \n\npotential (-1.6V) or alternatively increasing the solution temperature [2]. \n\nThe current paper is devoted to studying of electrodeposition of zinc from choline \n\nbased eutectic on anodic titanium oxide film. Bulk anodic titania has been investigated \n\nfor more than 50 years. Several properties such as growth factors [3-8], crystallinity [1, \n\n9-12], conductivity, influence of anodization solution and regime [13] were widely \n\nstudied by different authors. Despite all these studies deposition over anodic titania is still \n\nhardly understood. Only works about deposition of copper on titanium oxide films from \n\nwater solution were described in literature [14, 15]. Electrodeposition of metals from deep \n\neutectic solvent (DES) on titania covered electrodes has not yet been analysed. \n\nTitanium dioxide films both in pure state and after electrochemical modification \n\nhave distinguished properties, for instance, catalytic and photocatalytic [16, 17], self-\n\ncleaning and wetting [18], use as solar cell [19] and optical devices [20]. Furthermore, \n\nanodic titania is a promising porous matrix to be filled by different materials [21-23].  \n\nDeep eutectic solvent based on choline chloride was selected as electrolyte for \n\ndeposition due to its properties, such as negligible vapour pressure, wide electrochemical \n\nwindow and high thermal stability [24]. Choline eutectic is often called in literature as \n\nquasi ionic liquid since their behaviour is similar, for instance, low melting point, \n\nrelatively wide liquid-range etc. However, in contrast to conventional ionic liquids, DESs \n\nare very cheap, not-toxic and have good potential for industrial usage [25]. Abbott et al. \n\nhave widely studied properties of DESs based on choline chloride, namely viscosity and \n\nconductivity [26, 27]. Electrodeposition of metals [28, 29] and particularly zinc [30-36] \n\nand Zn-containing alloys [37] from these solvents was explored as well. Moreover the \n\nuse of DES as electrolyte gives an opportunity to dissolve compounds which are insoluble \n\nin water (for example ZnO) and to make deposition from these solutions [35, 38].  \n\nIn the present work zinc was chosen as a material to be deposited due to its \n\ncapability to transform afterwards into semiconductor materials such as zinc oxide and \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n109 \n\n \n\nzinc sulphide [39] and for comparison of the results with previous work [2] where \n\ndeposition of zinc on aluminium/alumina was reported. \n\nExperimental \n\nCoupons of titanium foil (100mm ?5mm ?1 mm, 99.2%, Alfa Aesar) were used \n\nas electrode material for sample preparation. The coupons were rinsed with acetone, \n\nethanol and distilled water and then were dried in air. Before anodization, the electrodes \n\nwere chemically polished in a HF:HNO3 mixture (1:3 by volume) to mirror finish and \n\nfinally were rinsed with deionized water. Part of their surface was isolated with \n\nchemically resistant varnish, giving an electrode working area of 0.5 cm2. The sample \n\nwith the thinnest barrier layer was prepared by activation in hydrofluoric acid. It is a \n\ncommon procedure before plating and it results in decrease of the native layer thickness \n\ndue to formation of soluble titanium fluorides. Formation of titanium hydride takes also \n\nplace [40] and this layer prevents generation of a new barrier layer [41]. The activation \n\nwas performed in 5% HF during 30 seconds.  \n\nA Keithley 237 High Voltage Source-Measure Unit was used as a current source \n\nfor the sample anodizing. A 1M sulphuric acid aqueous solution was used as electrolyte \n\n[12]. The anodization was performed in a galvanostatic mode with a current density of 10 \n\nmA/cm2. The counter electrode was a platinum foil. The process was terminated after the \n\ndesired voltage (3, 7, 10, 20, 40 V) was attained. The thinnest anodic film used in this \n\nwork (12 nm) corresponds to 3V. Preparation of thinner anodic titania layers is hindered \n\nbecause of low reproducibility of the experiments and inhomogeneity of the films. After \n\nanodization the electrodes were stored in a desiccator for stabilization of the compact \n\ntitania layer for 24 hours.  \n\nThickness of the layers was measured by Ellipsometry and Glow Discharge \n\nOptical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES). The spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements \n\nwere made using an AutoSE ellipsometer (HORIBA Scientific) with a total of 250 points \n\nin the wavelength interval 450-850 nm, an incidence angle of 70o, a signal quality of 30 \n\nand a measurement spot area of 250\u00d7250 \u00b5m2. The structural model used consists of a \n\nthree-layered structure incorporating substrate, titania layer and air as ambient medium \n\nwith a refractive index value of 1.00. The thickness of the substrate was considered \n\ninfinite and the refractive index was obtained by direct inversion of the ellipsometric data. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n110 \n\n \n\nTo describe the refractive index values the Lorentz model was used, which expresses the \n\nrelative complex dielectric constant as a function of the frequency (?) described by: \n\n \n\n? ?\n? ? ???\n\n???\n??\n\n???\n\n??\n?? ?\n\n?\ni\n\ns\n\n22\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n (V.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ??, ?s, ?0 (eV), ? (eV) are the high frequency relative dielectric constant, \n\nthe static relative dielectric constant, the oscillator resonant frequency and the damping \n\nfactor, respectively [42]. The fitting method has been described elsewhere [43]. The \n\nreported values for the thickness are the average of three measurements performed for \n\neach sample with a maximum standard deviation of 5%.  \n\n GDOES depth profile analysis of the coatings was done using a HORIBA GD-\n\nProfiler 2 with a copper anode of 4 mm in diameter. Argon sputtering of the sample \n\nsurface occurred at a pressure of 900 Pa and power of 10 W. A minimum of three \n\nmeasurements were performed for each sample. \n\nPreparation of DES electrolytes and the electrodeposition experiments have been \n\ndone in contact with air. The eutectic system was prepared by mixing choline chloride \n\n(ChCl, 98%) and ethylene glycol (EG, 99+%) in the molar ratio of 1:2. Anhydrous zinc \n\nchloride (99.99%) was added to the DES to obtain a 0.3 M solution, which was heated \n\nand kept at 60 \u00b0C under vacuum during 24 h. The as-prepared solution (hereafter DES:Zn) \n\nwas either used for electrodeposition or was stored in a desiccator over P2O5. All \n\nexperiments were performed in open air because the DES is water and air stable and it is \n\none of the main advantages of this electrolyte compared to ionic liquids. Moreover, it is \n\nnot sensitive even to small amount of water [24]. When not in use the DES was stored in \n\nthe desiccator with P2O5.  \n\nVoltammograms were recorded using a Bio-Logic SAS SP-300 potentiostat. \n\nMeasurements were performed in a Faraday cage. A three-electrode cell consisting of a \n\nplatinum wire as pseudo-reference electrode, graphite rod as counter electrode and the \n\nworking electrode was used. All voltammetric curves were recorded starting in the \n\ncathodic direction. In all potentiodynamic experiments, the potential scan rate was 20 \n\nmV/s. Each measurement was repeated minimum twice for reproducibility checking.  \n\nInvestigation of electrode surface morphology and elemental analysis were \n\nperformed using a Hitachi S-4100 scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with an \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n111 \n\n \n\nenergy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). An ImageJ 1.48v image processing software was \n\napplied for calculation of the electrode areas covered by the deposited zinc. \n\nThe Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with the use of a \n\nBruker IFS55 spectrometer equipped with a single horizontal Golden Gate attenuated \n\ntotal reflectance (ATR) cell. In the optical range of 350-4000 cm-1, 128 scans were \n\nperformed for each measurement. The resolution of the equipment is 4 cm-1. Templates \n\nwere prepared on thin titanium substrate (0.1 mm) involving the procedure that has been \n\ndescribed before. The samples were installed in contact with the DES:Zn and pressured \n\nto the crystal. \n\nA Digital Instruments NanoScope III atomic force microscope (AFM) system with \n\nExtenderTM Electronic Module was used for acquisition of topography. The \n\nmeasurements were performed with highly doped Si AFM probes purchased from App \n\nNano (model ACT). The probes had the following characteristics: tip pyramid height 14-\n\n16 ?m, tip radius&lt;10 nm, 300 kHz resonance frequency, spring constant around 37 N/m. \n\nResults and discussion \n\nTitanium anodization \n\nFigure V. 1 a shows the dependence of the signal intensity of the elements \n\ncomposing the titanium anodized layer (40 V) on its depth obtained by GDOES. It \n\ndemonstrates homogeneity of the oxide film and uniformity of sulphur distribution. \n\nSulphur is present in the titania film because sulphuric acid solution was used as an \n\nelectrolyte. Deviation of the profiles at the beginning of sputtering can be explained by \n\nthe presence of an adsorbed layer on the surface containing sulphur and oxygen, probably \n\nfrom the sulphuric acid. The oxygen concentration slightly decreases throughout the film \n\nbecause oxygen migration occurs during the anodization process, from the electrolyte to \n\nthe electrode leading to higher concentration of oxygen on the titania/electrolyte surface \n\nthan on titania/titanium interface. A well-defined interface between the anodic titania film \n\nand the titanium substrate was obtained. The plateau on the titanium and oxygen signal \n\nintensity curves during the glow discharge etching process corresponds to the oxide layer. \n\nFurther growth of the titanium signal indicates that the metal sputtering started.  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n112 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 1 Qualitative GDOES depth profiles of titanium anodized at different \n\nvoltages for Ti, O, S after anodization at 40 V (a), and for titanium after anodization \n\nat 3, 7, 10, 20 and 40 V (b). \n\nEllipsometry measurements were done in parallel to GDOES and data fitting were \n\nperformed using the Lorentz model. Both the techniques showed similar results in terms \n\nof thickness/voltage ratio for instance at 5 and 20 volts the ellipsometry results are 15 nm \n\nand 44 nm respectively, whereas the GDOES technique estimates 12 and 43 nm. \n\nRoutinely, the oxide thickness of the samples was controlled and presented (Figure V. 2) \n\nonly for GDOES due to similarity of the results. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 2 Film thickness vs anodizing potential of titanium in 1M sulphuric acid \n\nsolution measured by GDOES equipment. Solid line is used to guide eyes. \n\nThe GDOES data of Figure V. 2 shows that the thickness-voltage ratio for the \n\ngalvanostatic growth of anodic TiO2 is in the range of 2\u20133 nm/V, which is in accordance \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n113 \n\n \n\nwith the values commonly reported in literature for titania anodic films grown in sulphuric \n\nacid solutions [3-8]. \n\nZinc electrodeposition on Ti/TiO2 electrodes with different film \n\nthicknesses  \n\nTypical voltammograms that were obtained on zinc and on titanium electrode \n\ncovered with compact titania film in DES:Zn are presented in Figure V. 3. The potential \n\nfor reduction of zinc on zinc electrode is -1.1V (Figure V. 3). Nevertheless, the negative \n\ncurrent was only detected at -1.2V on the titanium/titania electrode after pre-treatment \n\n(activation) in hydrofluoric acid, which evidences the existence of an overpotential for \n\nzinc reduction on the titania surface. Fast current increase followed by a plateau was \n\nobserved for these electrodes. Strong cathodic current appears at -1.65V and corresponds \n\nto reduction of the electrolyte organic species. Decomposition occurs according to the \n\nmechanism described in literature [44, 45]. The small current that appears on the titania \n\ncovered electrodes probably corresponds to reduction of titania [23] since zinc was not \n\ndetected on the surface by SEM studies in this potential region. Electroreduction of zinc \n\nwas performed in the range from -1.2V to -1.7V with a 100mV step to find the best \n\nphysical properties of the deposit. The quality of the coating was evaluated visually. The \n\ndeposition potential of -1.6V was selected because it gives solid zinc coating with the best \n\nadhesive properties. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 3 Voltammograms for zinc and titanium covered with anodic titania of \n\ndifferent thicknesses electrodes (inset: magnification of -1.5 to -1.0 V zone). \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n114 \n\n \n\nInitial increase in the barrier layer thickness from the one corresponding to the HF \n\nactivated electrode until 12 nm obtained by anodizing leads to a strong decrease of the \n\nreduction current (Figure V. 3). It is typical for valve metals because of low conductivity \n\nof the oxide film. Normally, the resistance of the film rises with its growth, which makes \n\nthe deposition difficult. This situation was demonstrated for the like aluminium/alumina \n\nsystem in our previous work [2]. Increasing the alumina barrier thickness provides \n\nsignificant increase of the resistance and consequently decrease of the zinc reduction \n\ncurrent. Nevertheless, in the present case, the negative current on the titanium/titania \n\nelectrode with 18 nm titania film stays on the same level as with 12 nm thickness (Figure \n\nV. 3). Moreover, with further increment of thickness to 23 nm and thicker, the current \n\nrises, contrary to the case of alumina where the current decreases dramatically with \n\ngrowth of the film. The maximum current on titanium/titania electrode was obtained at \n\nmaximal film thickness of 84 nm, and is similar to the current on the activated electrode \n\n(Figure V. 3). The phenomenon of current increase on thicker anodic titania films was \n\ndemonstrated in Hyun Chang\u2019s work for copper deposition from water solution [15]. The \n\nauthors modified the Ti cathode surface by temperature oxidation and anodization \n\nprocess. Both cases showed enhanced deposition rate because the film is more conductive \n\nin spite of the oxide layer is thicker. They explained this fact by better crystallinity of the \n\nanodic film at higher anodization voltage and correspondingly at higher film thickness. \n\nSimilar conclusion was achieved by Shibata et Zhu [9]. The structure of the anodic oxide \n\nfilm on titanium was found to be dependent on the formation potential. Film \n\ncrystallization occurs at potentials more positive than 7.0 V. In the present work it can be \n\nsuggested an analogous explanation for the current increment. The oxide layer remains \n\namorphous on the initial stage of the growth and the conductivity decreases with film \n\nthickness (12 and 18 nm films). After reaching a critical anodization voltage, the anodic \n\nlayer starts crystallizing, which results in higher current for the 23 nm barrier film (limit \n\nvoltage of 10V) compared to the 12 and 18 nm films (limit voltage of 3 and 7V, \n\nrespectively). The film crystallinity and conductivity progressively increase with \n\nadditional accretion of the barrier, which reflects on the voltammetric curves as increase \n\nof current (Figure V. 3). These results are in accordance with Shibata\u2019s work [9] where it \n\nwas demonstrated that the crystallization starts after the anodization potential of 7 V. \n\nFigure V. 4 a depicts the current-time transients resulting from \n\nchronoamperometric experiments on titanium electrode covered with titania of different \n\nthicknesses at -1.6 V. The maximum of current was not detected for the HF activated \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n115 \n\n \n\nspecimen. The initial high current is decreasing according to the Cottrell equation [46]. It \n\nmeans that the nuclei formation in this case occurs fast and easily. The layer of titanium \n\nhydride formed on the electrode after activation is one of the conditions that probably \n\npromotes nucleation process due to the strong reducing ability of the compound. Zinc \n\ndeposition on the activated electrode is much faster than on thin barrier layers (12, 18 nm \n\nthick). The total electric charge starts to increase for the 23 nm layer and rises as the layer \n\nthickness grows. In our previous work [2], it was demonstrated that electrodepostion of \n\nzinc on native alumina layer (around 2 nm) was impossible in standard potentiostatic \n\nregime. Even after shifting the potential into the deep cathodic region (-5V) where intense \n\ngas evolution was observed there was no deposition of zinc on the electrode surface. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 4 Current-time transients resulting from chronoamperometric \n\nexperiments that were performed at a titanium electrode with different titania layer \n\nthicknesses in DES:Zn at -1.6V applied potential (inset: magnification of 0 to -0.6 s \n\nzone) (a). Comparison of experimental data obtained from current transients with \n\ninstantaneous and progressive nucleation models (b). \n\nThe amount of zinc that was deposited during 30 seconds was calculated from \n\nFaraday\u2019s law: \n\n \n\n? =\n?\n\n??\n (V.2) \n\n \n\nwhere n is the chemical amount of zinc deposited, Q is the total electric charge \n\npassed, which is calculated from the above current-time curves, z = 2 is the number of \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n116 \n\n \n\nelectrons transferred per ion and F is the Faraday constant. The results are shown in Figure \n\nV. 5 (red line). \n\n \n\nFigure V. 5 Chemical amount of zinc deposited on titanium electrode covered with \n\ntitania calculated by ImageJ software (black line) and by Faraday's law (red line). \n\nDeposition dwell was 30 s. Solid lines are used to guide eyes. \n\nAnalysis of SEM images of the samples was performed to confirm that the current \n\nincrease corresponds to the growth of the zinc deposition rate and not to additional \n\ncompetitive reactions (as in the case of aluminium/alumina). The typical image obtained \n\nfor deposited zinc on titania film, 23nm thick, at E = ?1.6V, is shown in Figure V. 6 a \n\nand in the inset after processing by ImageJ. At the early stages of Zn deposition (30 \n\nseconds) individual spherical particles with size d = 40 nm were formed. EDS analysis \n\n(Figure V. 6 c) shows the presence of Zn. The number and average size of the particles \n\nwere determined in the same way for all the samples. For the sake of simplicity it was \n\nassumed that the particles are spherical. Then the zinc volume was calculated and the \n\nchemical amount of the deposit obtained. The results demonstrate that the quantity of zinc \n\ndeposited on the surface increases with the barrier thickness growth (Figure V. 5, black \n\nline). The difference between the black and red lines could be because the deposition \n\nprocess efficiency is not 100% (around 60%). \n\n  \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n117 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 6 SEM images of titanium electrode surface covered with 23 nm titania \n\nfilm after zinc deposition at -1.6V from DES:Zn in PS mode (a) and in AC-PS mode \n\n(b) inset is a typical image obtained after processing by ImageJ. The EDS spectrum \n\nrecorded from the sample surface after zinc deposition in DC mode (23 nm anodic \n\nfilm) (c). Deposition dwell was 30 s. \n\nAs it has been mentioned in the introduction a strong interaction between the \n\nsolution eutectic components and alumina interface was observed during deposition on \n\nanodic alumina in our previous work [2]. Additional AC component superimposed on \n\nconstant DC potential makes the organic layer on the alumina/electrolyte interface less \n\ncompact and more permeable to zinc chloride anions. The positive influence of this \n\nregime, such as growth of zinc reduction rate, for electrodeposition on the \n\naluminium/alumina system was demonstrated. Identical study in this work was performed \n\nusing a sinusoidal potential of 50 mV amplitude superimposed on the DC potential of -\n\n1.6 V at the 1 kHz frequency. Specimens with titania layers of 12, 18, 23, 43 and 84 nm \n\nwere used. Typical SEM images of the electrode surface after 30 seconds of zinc \n\ndeposition on the titanium electrode covered with 23 nm titania film is presented in Figure \n\nV. 6 b.  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n118 \n\n \n\nThe particles size on the electrode after AC-PS mode deposition is bigger than on \n\nDC (PS) mode, but the number of the particles is less. The quantity of deposited zinc in \n\nboth modes was estimated by the same way using ImageJ and it is 1.5 times less in \n\npotentiostatic mode than in the AC-PS regime. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a \n\nsmall influence of the AC component on the deposition process. Increase of the zinc \n\namount was much smaller in comparison with the aluminium/alumina system where it \n\nwas found an increase of 10 times at the same conditions [2]. The small difference \n\nobserved can be explained by additional \u201celectro stirring\u201d on the AC-PS mode, i.e., \n\ntransport of charged species due to the alternating electric field. The dense organic layer \n\nformed in the case of alumina/aluminium system might not exist in the case of \n\ntitanium/titania. \n\nFTIR measurements were carried out to confirm that this organic layer does not \n\nform. FTIR-ATR spectra of DES:Zn in contact with titanium electrodes covered by titania \n\nare presented in Figure V. 7. The respective spectrum of blank DES:Zn is shown for \n\ncomparison. The observed bands in the DES:Zn spectra correlate well with the reference \n\nspectroscopic data for ethylene glycol and choline chloride. One can see that contact of \n\nDES:Zn with the electrode surface results in no shift of the characteristic bands. It differs \n\nfrom the case of alumina/DES interface where a O-H stretching shift around 135 cm-1 \n\nwas found [2]. Thereby we anticipate that no chemical bonds were formed between the \n\norganic species and the titanium/titania electrode. Titanium/titania and \n\naluminium/alumina systems despite chemical similarity demonstrated different properties \n\nin terms of interaction with DES. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 7 FTIR-ATR spectra of blank DES:Zn, and titanium covered with \n\ndifferent thicknesses of anodic titania films in contact with DES:Zn. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n119 \n\n \n\nZinc nucleation mechanism \n\nElectrodeposition of metals on an electrode with low chemical affinity to \n\nelectrodeposited metal usually occurs with overvoltage and involves three-dimensional \n\nnucleation with hemispherical growth of the nuclei [47]. There are two limiting cases of \n\nthree-dimensional nucleation: instantaneous and progressive. In the instantaneous model \n\npractically all nucleation sites are activated in a short time after potential is applied. \n\nProgressive model is the situation when the nucleation sites become activated during the \n\nexperiment. In the description below, we use the expressions instantaneous and \n\nprogressive models in the sense that it is closer to one or the other mechanism, although \n\nwe are aware that these are limiting cases. \n\nDeep understanding of the nucleation process and other processes, which occur in \n\nthe beginning of the deposition, is extremely important since the initial stage of the \n\nprocess is crucial to the properties and structure of the deposited materials. For example, \n\nin the same titania matrix, inside and over the tubes is possible to obtain different \n\nstructures such as nanowires, nanotubes, sandwich and coaxial multilayer structures. \n\nThe mechanism of nucleation and growth can be determined by graphical analysis \n\nof the current transients from chronoamperometric measurements. Such an approach has \n\nbeen commonly used in studies for metal nucleation on different substrates (Ge, Si, W, \n\nvitreous carbon, etc.) [36, 47-50]. Transition from instantaneous to progressive nucleation \n\nmechanism could occur with decrease of deposition overvoltage [51]. To detect the \n\npotential of this transition, current-time transients at different applied potentials were \n\nrecorded on a titanium electrode covered with a 23 nm titania film (Figure V. 8 a). The \n\ntransients are characterized by an initial increase of current followed by a drop at longer \n\ntime. We believe, that the nucleation process matches to 3D mechanism due to the high \n\ndeposition overpotential (about 100 mV) and is followed by diffusion-limited growth \n\nbecause of the transient shape [47]. The deposition transients acquired at different \n\novervoltages were plotted in dimensionless form by normalizing the current (j) and time \n\n(t) respectively to the maximum current (jmax) and time (tmax) where the maximum current \n\nis reached, Figure V. 8 b.  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n120 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 8 Current-time transients recorded at different potentials on a titanium \n\nelectrode covered with 23 nm titania layer in DES:Zn (a) and the same transients \n\nreplotted in dimensionless form (b). \n\nAccording to literature [47, 48, 52] for instantaneous nucleation the theoretical \n\ntransient is represented by: \n\n \n\n(\n?\n\n????\n)\n\n2\n\n= 1.9542\n??????0\n\n???0\n[1 ? ??? (?1.2564\n\n???0\n\n??????0\n)]\n\n2\n\n (V.3) \n\n \n\nfor progressive nucleation the theoretical transient is given by: \n\n \n\n(\n?\n\n????\n)\n\n2\n\n= 1.2254\n??????0\n\n???0\n[1 ? ??? (?2.3367\n\n(???0)\n2\n\n(???? ??0)\n2\n)]\n\n2\n\n (V.4) \n\nwhere t0 is the induction time, i.e. the time needed to form a nucleus larger than \n\nthe critical nucleus size. The respective plots are also shown in Figure V. 8 b (solid lines). \n\nElectrocrystallization of zinc in the potential range from -1.4 to -1.6 V fits well the \n\ninstantaneous mechanism. However, the curve recorded at more positive potential, -1.3 \n\nV, shifts towards to the progressive nucleation theoretical curve and it is situated between \n\ninstantaneous and progressive theoretical curves. The mechanism determination at higher \n\nvoltages (where it could be found better overlapping of the theoretical curve) is hindered \n\nbecause the peak maximum is not evident at potentials greater than -1.3 V. \n\nChronoamperometric curves in Figure V. 4 a were replotted in dimensionless form \n\n(Figure V. 4 b). The plot for the activated electrode is not in the figure since the maximum \n\non current time transient is absent as already explained in previous section. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n121 \n\n \n\nThe theoretical plots are also shown in Figure V. 4 b. Comparing the theoretical \n\nplots for progressive and instantaneous nucleation with the experimental plots for zinc \n\nreduction, it can be concluded that Zn deposition onto titanium/titania electrode proceeds \n\nby instantaneous three-dimensional nucleation. The mechanism is independent of the \n\ntitania thickness and denotes that practically all Zn nuclei on the electrode surface are \n\nformed at once and have the same size. These results correlate with the work of Abbott \n\net al. [30] where they reported that the electrodeposition of electronegative metals such \n\nas aluminium and zinc in ionic liquids occurs by instantaneous nucleation mechanism \n\nirrespectively of the ions or substrate material. Deviation from the theoretical curves after \n\ntmax>1 is probably related to accessory processes such as hydrogen and dioxolanes \n\nformation [44, 45, 53]. This has been also reported for different deep eutectic solvents, as \n\ncholine chloride and ethylene glycol DES [36]. Abbott et al. also demonstrated high \n\nmismatch between the experimental curves and the theoretical ones and explained it by \n\nspecific adsorption of species on the electrode surface, apparently chloride ions [30]. In \n\ncase of one side reaction, like hydrogen reduction, its contribution to the current could be \n\nmathematically extracted by using multiparametric model [54]. However, there is no \n\nunanimity in the origin and number of side reactions at low cathodic potentials in DES \n\n[36, 44, 45]. The impact of side reactions to overall current could be addressed in future \n\nstudies.  \n\nThe nucleation mechanism was additionally verified by AFM study. AFM \n\nmeasurements were performed on titanium electrode covered by 84 nm titania film at -\n\n1.6 V potential. Figure V. 9 shows AFM images of the electrode surface (area 5x5 \u00b5m) \n\nafter different times of deposition. The blank surface before application of potential is \n\nshown in Figure V. 9 a. The surface is not perfectly flat, revealing big irregularities. After \n\nthe initial 1.5 second of deposition formation of particles with sizes of ca. 85 nm on the \n\nelectrode surface was observed (Figure V. 9 b). Increasing the deposition time results in \n\ngradual increase of particles sizes: 120 and 170 nm for deposition times of 4 and 9 seconds \n\n(Figure V. 9 c, d), respectively. Statistically insignificant variations in number of particles \n\nper unit surface area at the different deposition times indicate that nucleation rate is much \n\nlower than the growth rate, clearly pointing to instantaneous nucleation. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n122 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V. 9 AFM images of titanium covered with 84 nm titania layer (a) and after \n\nzinc electrodeposition in DES:Zn at -1.6V: during 1.5 s (b); 4 s (c) and 9 s (d). \n\nConclusions \n\nElectrodeposition of zinc from 0.3M ZnCl2 solution in choline chloride/ethylene \n\nglycol eutectic solvent on titania barrier layer was successfully performed. Reduction of \n\nzinc species occurs much faster on thicker anodic films than on thinner ones. The \n\nchemical amount of reduced metallic zinc at -1.6 V during 30 seconds is 4 times higher \n\non 84 nm thick films than on 12 nm ones. It happens because both film thickness and \n\ncrystallinity grow with the anodization potential, the latter leading to higher oxide \n\nconductivity. Application of -1.6V DC potential, superimposed by an alternating \n\nsinusoidal component of 50 mV, leads to moderate increase of the amount of zinc \n\nreduced. Regarding this fact and additional FTIR results it is assumed that there is no \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n123 \n\n \n\nformation of a dense organic layer on titanium/titania electrode contrary to the \n\naluminium/alumina system. Thus, zinc deposition becomes easier. \n\nElectrodeposition of zinc at -1.6 V from DES occurs by the instantaneous three-\n\ndimensional nucleation mechanism and it is not influenced by the titania layer thickness. \n\nThis result was confirmed by AFM studies. A trend for transition from instantaneous \n\nnucleation mechanism to progressive one seems to occur at deposition potential of  \n\n-1.3 V.  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n124 \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe financial support of the European Commission and Portuguese Foundation \n\nfor Science and Technology (FCT) in frame of the projects PIRSES-GA-2011-295273 \u2013 \n\nNANEL and PTDC/CTM-NAN/113570/2009, respectively, is gratefully acknowledged. \n\nThe financial support of a Post-Doctoral grant (ref.

Electroreduction is performed \n\nby a pulse method in titanium dioxide templates modified in three different ways. Titania \n\nnanotubes were formed in ethylene glycol based electrolyte with 0.38% (wt.) ammonium \n\nfluoride and 1.79% (wt.) of water. The first template has been used as-prepared, without \n\nany modification. Such a matrix shows a low fill-factor and zinc electrodeposition mainly \n\noccurs on the top of the tubes. The next template was annealed at 450oC to complete \n\ncrystallization of titania. It results in electrodeposition of zinc along the entire tube surface \n\nand consequently in formation of coaxial structure. The third template was modified \n\nbased on selective crystallization of the pore bottoms using higher anodisation voltage \n\n(80 V) than the one used for tubes formation (40 V) in sulphuric acid electrolyte. The \n\nsuccessful bottom-up filling of the titania nanotubes is demonstrated in this case. \n\nInvestigation of the tubes filling is performed by a set of complementary techniques such \n\nas GDOES, SEM and TEM. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Titanium dioxide, deep eutectic solvent, ionic liquids, \n\nelectrodeposition, zinc, choline chloride. \n\nIntroduction  \n\nRecently, porous anodic films on valve metals such as aluminium [1], zirconium \n\n[2, 3], iron [4], titanium [3, 5] etc., attract great attention due to wide range of applications. \n\nOne of the most important uses of the templates is electroformation of nanorods [6] and \n\nnanowires. The parameters of matrix such as length and diameter of the pores, wall \n\nthickness can be easily controlled [7] by composition of the anodisation solution [8-11], \n\nits temperature [12, 13] or the applied voltage [14, 15].  \n\nTitanium dioxide has semiconductive properties that advantageously differentiate \n\nit from many other porous anodic layers. Additionally, it reveals common porous anodic \n\ntemplate characteristics such as high regularity, homogeneity of the layer etc. However, \n\nthere is scant work on application of porous anodic titania (PAT) as a matrix for \n\nelectropreparation of metallic or other conductive nanowires, when compared with a \n\ngrowing number of existing studies of the \u201csister material\u201d porous alumina. Moreover, \n\nthe majority of both templates studies was performed with detached oxide template \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n130 \n\n \n\ninstead having them attached to the metal electrode [16-19]. The use of the detached \n\ntemplate leads to increase of cost and time due to the additional step of substrate removal \n\nand evaporation of an electrical contact. There were several attempts to perform \n\ndeposition directly in the pores without removing the original substrate. Macak et al [20] \n\nhave reported increasing the conductivity of the bottom part of the tubes via proton \n\nintercalation (Ti4+ + e- + H+ ? Ti3+H+). \n\nPorous titania template can be formed in a number of inorganic solutions \n\ncontaining sulphate [21], phosphate [10, 22], acetate [23] ions etc. or in organic solutions \n\n[5] which are based on glycerol [15], ethylene glycol etc. The presence of fluoride ions is \n\nmandatory for all these electrolytes, otherwise a dense oxide layer will form instead of a \n\nporous one. In the current work we have used ethylene glycol based electrolyte for \n\nformation of the pores with several micrometres length and with very smooth walls.  \n\nElectrodeposition of active metals from water based solutions is difficult or even \n\nimpossible. Ionic liquids are promising electrolytes in this area, because they demonstrate \n\nunique properties such as wide electrochemical window, high thermal stability, \n\nconductivity, negligible vapour pressure, etc [24]. High price and water sensitivity are the \n\nbiggest disadvantages of classical ionic liquids. Deep eutectic solvents [25] (DES) are a \n\ncheap alternative to common ionic liquids with similar physicochemical properties. DES \n\nare non-toxic, water-/air- stable and also have good potential to be scaled up to industrial \n\nlevel [25]. Choline chloride based DES is one of the alternative green solvents. Several \n\ngroups have studied in detail the properties of the choline chloride DES. Abbott et al. has \n\nstudied viscosity and conductivity [26, 27] and influence of different hydrogen bond \n\ndonors [28, 29]. Moreover, electrodeposition of different metals such as zinc [30-36], tin \n\n[37], silver [38] and alloys [39] is under intensive investigation. \n\nIn our previous works we have studied zinc electrodeposition from choline chloride \n\n(ChCl):ethylene glycol (EG) DES on bulk anodic titania [40]. It was found that \n\nelectrodeposition on a thick titanium dioxide layer occurred faster than on a thin film. \n\nTaking into account previous studies [41] it was suggested that crystallinity of the films \n\nformed at higher anodising voltage (and correspondingly thicker ones) is better. \n\nThe main aim of present work is the investigation of direct electrodeposition of \n\nmetallic nanorods from deep eutectic solvent into porous anodic titania templates directly \n\non the titanium substrate. Until now, there is no report on successful electrodeposition of \n\nzinc in PAT template. Zinc was chosen as a model metal to be electrodeposited because \n\nit is an attractive metal due to further possibilities to be oxidized leading to semiconductor \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n131 \n\n \n\nmaterials such a zinc oxide, zinc sulphide, zinc selenide, etc. Moreover, the similar \n\napproach can be used for electrodeposition of other metals.  \n\n \n\nExperimental  \n\nMaterials \n\nTitanium foil of 1 mm thick (99.2%, Alfa Aesar), Nitric acid (68-70%, Alfa Aesar), \n\nHydrofluoric acid (48-51%, Alfa Aesar), Ammonium fluoride (Puriss p.a. Sigma-\n\nAldrich) Ethylene glycol (99.8% anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich), Choline chloride (>98%, \n\nSigma), Ethanol (absolute anhydrous), Zinc chloride (98+%, Alfa Aesar), Sulphuric acid \n\n(95-98%, Alfa Aesar) were used as received. Deionized water was used as solvent. \n\nProcedures \n\nCoupons of titanium foil (100?5?1 mm) were used as electrode material for \n\nsample preparation. The coupons were consequently rinsed with acetone, ethanol, and \n\ndistilled water and then they were dried in air. Before anodization, the electrodes were \n\nchemically polished in a HF:HNO3 mixture (1:3 by volume) to mirror finish and finally were \n\nrinsed with deionized water. A part of their surface was isolated with chemically resistant \n\nvarnish, giving defined electrode working area of about 1 cm2. \n\nA Keithley 237 High Voltage Source-Measure Unit was used as a current source \n\nfor the sample anodizing. Ethylene glycol solution with 0.38% (wt.) ammonium fluoride \n\nand 1.79% (wt.) of water was used as electrolyte [42]. The anodization was performed in \n\na potentiostatic mode with an applied voltage of 40 V applied for 1 hour. The counter \n\nelectrode was a platinum foil. Anodization was carried out in two steps with intermediate \n\nremoval of the oxide. The voltage and the electrolyte were the same for both steps and \n\nduration of the second step was 30 minutes. Removal of the anodic layer after the first \n\nstep was done by ultra sonication in the distilled water during 5 minutes. After anodization \n\nthe electrodes were washed in ethanol and stored in a desiccator for stabilization of the \n\ntitania layer during 24 hours. Mechanism of pore formation allows preparation of highly-\n\nordered template using the two-step technique [43]. \n\nThe crystallization was performed in a furnace at 450oC for 5 hours with 2oC/min \n\nheating and cooling ramps. \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n132 \n\n \n\nPreparation of DES electrolytes and the electrodeposition experiments were \n\ncarried out in contact with air. The eutectic system was prepared by mixing choline \n\nchloride (ChCl) and ethylene glycol (EG) in the molar ratio of 1:2. Anhydrous zinc \n\nchloride was added to the DES to obtain a 0.5 M solution, which was heated and kept at \n\n60\u00b0C under vacuum for 24 hours. The as-prepared solution (hereafter DES:Zn) was either \n\ndirectly used for electrodeposition or was stored in desiccator over P2O5.  \n\nElectrodeposition was performed using a Bio-Logic SAS SP-300 potentiostat. All \n\nmeasurements were done in a Faraday cage. A three-electrode cell consisting of a \n\nplatinum wire as a reference electrode, graphite rod as a counter electrode and titanium \n\ntemplate as a working electrode was used in the experiments. All electrodes after \n\ndeposition were rinsed in distilled water and then were stored in deionized water for \n\nseveral hours for physically adsorbed zinc species removal. \n\nInvestigation of the electrode surface morphology and elemental analysis was \n\nperformed using a Hitachi SU-70 scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with an \n\nenergy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). A Hitachi 9100 transmission electron microscope \n\n(TEM) with acceleration voltage 300kV was also used for the analysis. \n\nThe thickness of the layers was estimated by Glow Discharge Optical Emission \n\nSpectroscopy (GDOES). GDOES depth profile analysis of the coatings was done using a \n\nHORIBA GD-Profiler 2 with a copper anode of 4 mm in diameter. Argon sputtering of \n\nthe sample surface occurred at a pressure of 650 Pa and power of 30 W. Plasma polishing \n\nwas performed at a pressure of 900 Pa and power of 10 W. About 1 \u00b5m of the porous \n\ntemplate have been removed during plasma polishing. \n\nResults and discussion  \n\nTypical SEM image of porous anodic titania template after anodisation at the \n\nconditions indicated in Experimental is presented in Figure VI. 1a. An uniform porous \n\nlayer is self-aligned and well-ordered forming tapered tubes array, wider at the top [44, \n\n45]. It is also evident that the pores are open on the top. Diameter of the pores and wall \n\nthickness on the interface after 0.5 hour of anodisation are about 70 and 30 nm \n\nrespectively. The thickness of the porous layer is in the range of 3-3.5 \u00b5m as shown in \n\nFigure VI. 1b. The tubes have a smooth wall morphology typical for the anodic layers \n\ngrown in organic electrolytes [46]. Qualitative GDOES profile of the tubes is presented \n\nin Figure VI. 1c. There are two regions which belong to porous titania layer and titanium \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n133 \n\n \n\nsubstrate. After initiating sputtering the titanium and oxygen signals reach a plateau \n\nwhich corresponds to the porous titania part. The second region with the maximal \n\ntitanium signal intensity and oxygen background level has been reached at the end of \n\nsputtering. It corresponds to metallic titanium (substrate) sputtering. The porous film has \n\nhomogeneous composition along the entire length of the tubes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 1 SEM images of the titanium electrode surface (a), cross-section (b) and \n\nqualitative GDOES profile (c) obtained on electrode after 30 min of anodisation in \n\nethylene glycol ammonium fluoride solution at 40V. \n\nFigure VI. 2 TEM image of the porous titania layer with the barrier film on the \n\nbottom which was formed during anodization. It can be seen that the pores are closed by \n\ntitania from the bottom. This compact layer on the pore bottom is named in literature \n\nbarrier layer and its formation is typical for valve metals such as tungsten, aluminium etc \n\n[47]. In contrast to the majority of other barrier layers titanium dioxide is a \n\nsemiconductor. Comparatively the high conductivity of the titania barrier layer facilitates \n\nthe filling of the porous template. On the other hand, conductivity of the titanium dioxide \n\nis also a weakness of this template, because the deposition can occur not only on the \n\nbottom but also on the pore walls and on the electrode surface. The Zn electrodeposition \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n134 \n\n \n\nexperiments were performed using the titania templates described above. Electrical \n\nparameters such as current profile and current distribution affect the quantity of reduced \n\nzinc at the interface and the uniformity of the deposition process. Optimal results were \n\nobtained with a pulsed technique at a current density of 100 mA/cm2 (current applied in \n\none step). Cathodic and anodic rectangular pulses with a dwell time of 10 \u00b5s and 2 \u00b5s, \n\nrespectively, and the same absolute value of current density were applied sequentially. \n\nOne cycle was applied every second. Anodic current is needed to remove metallic zinc \n\nfrom the electrode interface and opens access to the fresh electrolyte inside the pores. \n\nMoreover, a positive potential promotes electromigration of negatively charged zinc \n\nspecies (ZnCl3\n-, Zn2Cl5\n\n- [32, 39]) inside the tubes. Enrichment of the electrolyte in zinc \n\nspecies also occurs during intervals between the pulses. The relatively long waiting time \n\nbetween the pulses was chosen to allow partial relaxation of the system taking into \n\naccount the length of the pores and high viscosity of the electrolyte. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 2 TEM image of as-prepared titanium dioxide tube, the inset shows \n\nselected area electron diffraction pattern. \n\nElectrodeposition in as-prepared PAT \n\nThe inset in Figure VI. 2 presents an electron diffraction image of as-prepared \n\ntitanium dioxide tubes. Diffuse ring without separate reflections suggests that the as-\n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n135 \n\n \n\nprepared porous titania layer is amorphous. The conductivity of the amorphous titania is \n\nlower than conductivity of the crystalline titania. This causes difficulties during \n\ndeposition, but even so in this condition electroreduction occurs.  \n\nIn this work the filling of the pores along their length was controlled by GDOES \n\ntechnique. The elemental depth profile of the sample obtained after one hour of deposition \n\nin as-prepared template is presented in Figure VI. 3a. The position of the interface \n\nbetween the porous titania and substrate was assessed through Ti profile. After initiating \n\nsputtering the titanium signal reaches a plateau which corresponds to porous titania part. \n\nThe maximum of the intensity has been reached in the end of sputtering that corresponds \n\nto metallic titanium (substrate). Zinc signal has very high intensity in the beginning of the \n\nelectrode sputtering, but it is followed by a sharp decrease. It is evident that the zinc layer \n\nwas formed mainly on the top of the pores with only minor penetration into pores. The \n\nzinc signal goes down to the background at the titania/titanium interface that means \n\nalmost no zinc deposition occurs at the pores bottom.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 3 Qualitative depth profile of a porous titanium oxide measured by \n\nGDOES after zinc deposition during 1 h (a) and schematic representation of the \n\npores filling (b). \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n136 \n\n \n\nThis result was confirmed by the electron microscopy as well. Figure VI. 4a depicts \n\na top view of the porous template after 1 hour of deposition. The upper part of the template \n\n(around 1 \u00b5m here and after) was removed by soft plasma polishing using the GDOES \n\nequipment. The pores fill-factor (ratio between the numbers of filled pores to the total \n\nnumber) at this depth is very low, about 5-10%, and decreases closer to the bottom \n\n(GDOES results). Additional STEM investigation (Figure VI. 4b) demonstrates that the \n\npores, besides being covered by the zinc layer on the top, are also sealed in random places \n\nas it is schematically demonstrated in Figure VI. 3b. Sealing the pores at the middle blocks \n\nthe access of fresh electrolyte and impairs their filling. Changing the electrodeposition \n\nparameters does not solve this issue. Therefore, the next step was to modify the template \n\nin order to improve the electrodeposition inside the pores.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 4 SEM (after plasma polishing) (a) and STEM (b) micrographs obtained \n\nafter electrodeposition in as-prepared template for 1 h. \n\nElectrodeposition in annealed PAT \n\nIncrease of the conductivity of the porous titania template achieved via annealing \n\nin air at 450oC. In these conditions the amorphous titania converts into anatase phase that \n\nleading to increase of electrical conductivity and, as a result, to more uniform \n\nelectrodeposition along the whole pore surface. Figure VI. 5 depicts TEM micrograph of \n\nporous titania film after annealing. Electron diffraction pattern (insert in Figure VI. 5) \n\ndemonstrates discrete rings with bright spots and it indicates the anatase crystalline \n\nstructure. \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n137 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 5 TEM image of annealed titanium dioxide tube, the inset shows selected \n\narea electron diffraction pattern. \n\nElectrodeposition of zinc was performed at the same conditions as those applied in \n\nthe as-prepared template. GDOES profile for such sample is presented in Figure VI. 6a. \n\nOnly one titanium profile is shown because of similarity of templates. With the help of \n\nthis profile the transition from anodic titania to titanium has been demonstrated. The depth \n\nprofiles for Zn is also presented for two different electrodeposition times, namely 1 hour \n\nand 10 minutes. The zinc signal after one hour of deposition in annealed template has a \n\npeak in the beginning of sputtering, and then it decreases and reaches a plateau followed \n\nby a second decrease until the background level at the titania/titanium interface. The \n\ntemplate can be divided in three main zones according to the shape of the zinc signal \n\ncurve. The first zone, in the beginning of sputtering, is the electrode surface and it has a \n\nhigh zinc signal because of a deposit formed on the electrode surface. The middle part of \n\nthe template (zone II) shows a plateau which means that pores are successfully and \n\nhomogeneously filled along the length. Then, near the interface between the anodic film \n\nand substrate (zone III), a small zinc peak appears and it can be explained by the presence \n\nof empty space next to the bottom as schematically shown in Figure VI. 6b. This \n\nirregularity forms due to strong diffusion limitation, which originates concentration \n\ngradient of zinc species and consequently results in different zinc deposition rate along \n\nthe length of pores. The faster deposition rate on the wall surface at the pore opening \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n138 \n\n \n\nleads to the situation that after a certain time the pore fully closes leaving a void with \n\nentrapped electrolyte closer to the pore bottom. High homogeneity (geometrical shape \n\nand distribution) of the tubes ensures sealing of the pores mainly at specific depth \n\ndepending on solution concentration, pore length and diameter. A noteworthy detail is \n\nthat regular sealing (at the same distance from the surface) is only possible if growth \n\noccurs through the whole length of the tube simultaneously, otherwise the pores close \n\nrandomly as it was shown for the as-prepared templates.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 6 Qualitative depth profile of a porous titanium oxide measured by \n\nGDOES after zinc deposition during 10 min and 1 h (a) and schematic \n\nrepresentation of the pores filling after 1 h (b) and 10 min (c) of deposition. \n\nAnalysing the depth profiles after shorter deposition times can provide important \n\ninformation on the kinetics of pore filling. The profile after 10 minutes was chosen since \n\nthis time ensures a detectable signal, but at the same time the sealing doesn\u2019t occur yet \n\n(green curve in Figure VI. 6a). The zinc signal reaches a plateau at the beginning of \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n139 \n\n \n\nsputtering and remains at the same level until pore bottoms are reached. It is reasonable \n\nto suggest that, in this zone, the walls of the pores are homogeneously covered with a thin \n\nlayer of zinc as schematically represented in Figure VI. 6c. The peak on the zinc signal \n\nappears near the titania/titanium interface presumably because the higher quantity of zinc \n\ndeposited in this plane.  \n\nIn support of GDOES results, SEM studies were also performed. Figure VI. 7 \n\ndemonstrates templates surfaces after 1 hour and after 10 minutes of deposition (GDOES \n\npolishing was also carried out). Zinc nanowires inside the template are clearly seen after \n\n1 hour of deposition (Figure VI. 7a). The fill-factor at this plane is near 90% which is \n\nmuch higher than in the as-prepared templates. The SEM image after a short-time \n\ndeposition indicates formation of zinc precipitates on the tubes walls (Figure VI. 7b).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 7 SEM (after plasma polishing) micrographs obtained after \n\nelectrodeposition in annealed template for 1 h (a) and 10 min (b). \n\nBased on both GDOES measurements (1 hour and 10 minutes) and SEM results \n\nwe suggest that zinc deposition occurs simultaneously on the whole titania surface and in \n\nthe beginning of growth zinc forms coaxial tubes (titania outer layer and zinc inner). \n\nLonger deposition leads to sealing the tubes and filling of the template from these seals \n\nuntil interface (Figure VI. 6b). \n\nElectrodeposition in PAT after bottom crystallization. \n\nAs it was shown above, electrodeposition in the as-prepared and in the annealed \n\ntemplates occurs on the whole tube length. Based on this result one can assume that \n\nbottom-up filling of the tubes requires higher conductivity of the bottom of the pores \n\ncompared to the walls. One of the ways to create different conductivity is selective \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n140 \n\n \n\ncrystallisation. Fortunately, during the pores preparation process, current passes mostly \n\nthrough the bottom of the tubes [45]. It makes possible a selective electrochemical \n\nmodification of pore bottom without strong effect on the walls.  \n\nInfluence of the anodisation parameters on crystallinity of the titania was \n\ndemonstrated by Shibata, Zhu [41] and Xing et al. [48]. The authors showed that dense \n\nanodic titania films prepared at higher anodisation voltage [41] and at longer anodisation \n\ntime [48] had better crystallinity. Additionally, it was shown in our recent paper [40] that \n\nzinc electrodeposition rate raises with increasing the titania barrier layer thickness. At the \n\nsame time, the thickness of the anodic barrier layer depends on the oxidation voltage and \n\nbecomes bigger at higher potential. Therefore, an additional anodisation step was applied \n\nto the as-prepared template. The treatment of the prepared template was done in a 1M \n\nsulphuric acid in two steps. The solution and procedure of anodisation were the same as \n\nthose used in our previous work where the compact anodic titania films were studied [40]. \n\nThe first step was performed in galvanostatic mode at 10 mA/cm2. The second step took \n\nplace in potentiostatic mode at 80 V during 2.5 hours. Galvanostatic mode was changed \n\nto potentiostatic one when the potential reached 80 V. The anodisation voltage at this \n\nprocess is two times higher than template formation voltage (40 V) that, together with \n\nlong oxidation time, results in thicker and better crystallized barrier layer in comparison \n\nwith that in the as-prepared template. \n\nEffect of such an additional anodisation on the template structure was analysed by \n\nTEM. Regular porous structure with relatively thick barrier layer on the bottom \n\n(compared to the as-prepared template, Figure VI. 2) is seen in Figure VI. 8a. Moreover, \n\nthe selected area electron diffraction shows significant difference in crystallinity of the \n\nanodic titania at walls and barrier parts. The diffraction pattern of walls does not represent \n\nseparate reflections indicating that the material is amorphous (Figure VI. 8b). \n\nNevertheless, at the diffraction pattern from the barrier layer shows rings, which confirm \n\nthe polycrystalline structure of this area (Figure VI. 8c). The reflections are not sharp due \n\nto very small size of the crystallites.  \n\n \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n141 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 8 TEM image of titanium dioxide tube after bottom crystallization (a), \n\nselected area electron diffraction pattern of the walls (b) and bottom part (c). \n\nZinc deposition in the template after crystallisation of the barrier layer was \n\nperformed at the same condition as in two cases described above. The GDOES results \n\nobtained on this specimen are presented in Figure VI. 9. Zinc signal after 1 hour of \n\ndeposition has a high intensity in the beginning of sputtering, afterward the intensity \n\nslowly decreases until the template bottom is reached. The amount of zinc is \n\ncomparatively high along the whole length of titania pores, and in this way the filling of \n\nthe pores had to start from the bottom. A gradual decrease of the zinc signal happens \n\nbecause the template is imperfect. Although reduction occurs mainly on the bottom part \n\nthere is also some deposition simultaneously on the walls (although in a far less degree \n\nthan in the case of the as-prepared template). \n\n \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n142 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI. 9 Qualitative depth profile of a porous titanium oxide measured by \n\nGDOES after zinc deposition during 10 min and 1 h (a) and schematic \n\nrepresentation of the pores filling after 1 h (b) and 10 min (c) of deposition. \n\nAn additional proof of the suggested mechanism of pore filling can be obtained \n\nafter analysis of the electrode prepared after 10 minutes of deposition (Figure VI. 9a, \n\ngreen line). Zinc signal has a peak close to the bottom and almost background signal in \n\nthe beginning of sputtering. This difference of the zinc signal is explained by a small \n\namount of zinc which was deposited at different parts of the tubes. Filling of the tubes \n\nafter 1 hour and after 10 minutes of deposition are presented schematically in Figure VI. \n\n9b and c correspondingly.  \n\nIt is evident from SEM image and agrees with GDOES results that most of the \n\npores are filled by secondary material (Figure VI. 10a). Besides, the fill-factor is about \n\n90% that is much higher than that in the case of the as-prepared template. The STEM \n\nimage presented in Figure VI. 10b demonstrates homogeneous pores filling.

It was demonstrated that electrodeposition in the as-prepared \n\ntemplate occurs in random places without regular pore filling. Annealing of the template \n\nat 450oC converts amorphous titania of the as-prepared template to anatase. It improves \n\nconductivity of the template along the full length of the pores and allows regular \n\ndeposition over the whole pore surface. Successful bottom up filling was performed in \n\nthe template with additional electrocrystallization of the barrier layer.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n144 \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe financial support of the European Commission and Portuguese Foundation for \n\nScience and Technology (FCT) in frame of the projects PIRSES-GA-2011-295273 \u2013 \n\nNANEL and PTDC/CTM-NAN/113570/2009, respectively, is gratefully acknowledged. \n\nM.

This subject has been fully \n\ninvestigated using a step-by-step approach for two most common metallic substrates. The \n\nstudies were started from the modelling of reduction processes on the dense barrier layer, \n\nwhich mimics the pore bottom and then, the obtained results were applied to the porous \n\ntemplates. One more important feature, namely the adsorbed layer of DES on the anodic \n\noxide/DES interface which formed in the considered systems was thoroughly studied.  \n\nTemplates preparation and characterization \n\nThere were two different metal substrates used for preparation of dense and porous \n\nanodic layers in the work. Series of the samples with different thickness of the oxide films \n\non both titanium and aluminium substrates were successfully prepared in solutions of \n\nsulfuric acid and ammonium pentaborate, correspondingly. The thickness of the barrier \n\nfilms was estimated using the complementary techniques such as GDOES, EIS and \n\nellipsometry.  \n\nPorous anodic templates on aluminium and titanium were formed in an oxalic acid \n\naqueous solution and in fluoride containing ethylene glycol based electrolyte, \n\ncorrespondingly. Both types of the prepared templates were well-ordered and had similar \n\nmorphology: the pore diameter of 60-70 nm and the wall thickness of 20-30 nm.  \n\nStudies of the dense barrier layer influence \n\nThe electrodeposition studies were initially performed on flat electrodes covered \n\nby dense anodic films. These studies showed a strong impact of structure and thickness \n\nof the barrier layer on the electrodeposition process, but the influence is very different in \n\naluminium oxide and in titanium oxide. As alumina film is an insulator, it was found that \n\nthe zinc electroreduction rate is lower when the barrier film is thicker. Moreover, the \n\nformation of a dense organic layer by specific adsorption of the electrolyte components, \n\nsuch as choline cation and ethylene glycol on the alumina surface was revealed. The \n\norganic layer was shown to have an adverse impact due to additional limitation on \n\nmigration of zinc species to the electrode surface. The way to avoid or at least to minimize \n\nthe effect of the organic layer formation was suggested. It was shown that relatively small \n\nAC perturbation overlapped on the potential results in destabilization of the layer and \n\n\n\nPhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich \n\n150 \n\n \n\nenhances the zinc reduction. Furthermore, the temperature increase causes growing of the \n\nkinetics energy that hinders the layer stabilization.  \n\nThe dense anodic titania was revealed to show the opposite thickness related \n\nbehaviour in comparison to that of alumina. Reduction of zinc species occurs much faster \n\non thicker anodic films than on thinner ones. It was explained by crystallization of the \n\ntitania layer at higher potentials that leads to higher conductivity of the layer and higher \n\nrate of zinc reduction. Moreover, neither adsorption of the organic components on the \n\nelectrode surface nor formation of a dense organic layer have been detected in contrast to \n\nalumina. It suggests again that each type of templates should be studied separately in spite \n\nof their apparent similarity. Additionally, based on the chronoamperometric \n\nmeasurements confirmed by SEM and AFM observations, the nucleation mechanism has \n\nbeen determined for different film thicknesses and overvoltages.  \n\nPorous anodic templates filling \n\nThe porous anodic alumina has been successfully used as the template for \n\nelectrodeposition of zinc nanowires. The main advantage of this method is the use of \n\nporous films directly on the substrate without any intermediate stages. The electrofilling \n\nof this type of templates by electrodeposition from DES was reported for the first time. A \n\ntwo-step process was developed and used for the electrosynthesis. The first step is AC \n\npre-nucleation of zinc on the pore bottom. The second step is the galvanostatic pores \n\nfilling. The optimal conditions, including current density, frequency, relaxation time have \n\nbeen found. As a result, highly uniform, well-ordered zinc nanorods have been obtained. \n\nThe porous anodic titania has been chosen as the another template for the zinc \n\nnanorods formation due to conductive behavior of the oxide. Electrodeposition of zinc \n\nwas performed in the titania-based templates modified in three different ways. The first \n\none was used as-prepared. It is found that electrodeposition occurs randomly along the \n\nfull length of the pores that leads to sealing of the pores and thus to a non-uniform filling. \n\nAmorphous titania in the second template was converted to the anatase phase by \n\nannealing. It improved conductivity of the template and allowed regular zinc \n\nelectroreduction over the whole pore surface. This modification is suitable for production \n\nof coaxial structures. The last modification, selective bottom crystallization, allowed a \n\nbottom up filling of the pores and formation of the zinc nanorods. The electrochemical \n\n\n\nElectrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates \n\n151 \n\n \n\nparameters, such as pulse length, current density, relaxation time, and their influence on \n\nthe fill-factor have been also studied. \n\nMy contribution to the work presented (published papers) \n\nThe main part of the work and data reported in chapters III-VI were obtained and \n\nanalysed by myself. The papers were also written by myself although the final corrections \n\nwere performed together with my supervisors. Since almost all the works required \n\nadditional characterization techniques such as ellipsometry, AFM, XRD etc., other \n\nresearchers from our group and other groups assisted me with that. In general, my work \n\nwas more focused on the electrochemical experiments: templates preparation, zinc \n\nelectrodeposition, pores filling etc.  \n\nMore specifically: \n\nChapter III: I have prepared all templates, suggested two-step technique for \n\ndeposition and performed pores electrofilling. The characterizations were mostly \n\nperformed by myself except some SEM observations. \n\nChapter IV: The template synthesis, zinc electrodeposition and characterization \n\nwere fully performed by myself, but some advices concerning the electrochemical \n\nmeasurements were received from my colleagues. \n\nChapter V: The core work such as template synthesis, zinc electrodeposition and \n\nelectrochemical studies has been done by myself. I also performed nearly all \n\ncharacterization of the samples, except for the ellipsometry and AFM.  \n\nChapter VI: I have performed all the work.  \n\n \n\nThe full list of publications is presented below: \n\nCore publications of the thesis: \n\n1.

The first one is \n\nelectrodeposition of different secondary materials for specific applications. For instance, \n\nthe elecrodeposition methods developed for zinc can be can be applied to magnetic, \n\nsemiconducting materials or to materials with high catalytic activity. I have already \n\nstarted investigation on conversion of zinc nanorods to zinc oxide and zinc sulphide. \n\nThe second group of my research activities I would like to link with anodic \n\nprocesses in DES. Although this area is rarely studied, it has a great potential in \n\nelectropolishing and anodization of metals, doping of the anodic films by different species \n\nwith the view to improve corrosion protection, conductivity, stability etc. Both areas are \n\ninteresting and attractive for me."}]}}}
