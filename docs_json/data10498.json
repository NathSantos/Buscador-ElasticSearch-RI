It was great to know you \n\nand to be able to work with you! I am also thankful to Jose-Manuel Fortu\u00f1o for his friendship \n\nand technical support during the daily SEM sessions at ICM. The beautiful photographic \n\nappendix presented in this thesis was made thanks to you! \n\n- to Vera Pawlowsky-Glahn for your permanent generosity while \u201ctranslating\u201d the basic \n\nconcepts and applications of Compositional Data Analysis. It was a wonderful experience to \n\nparticipate in the 4\nth\n CoDA Workshop (May 2011) and to be able to work with you since then. \n\nYour constant encouragement was very important!

Para compreender a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre os coccolit\u00f3foros e as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais, os resultados foram interpretados numa perspectiva multidisciplinar, \n\nintegrados num conjunto significativo de dados relativos \u00e0s caracter\u00edsticas ecol\u00f3gicas e \n\nhidrol\u00f3gicas das massas de \u00e1gua superficiais da margem Portuguesa central (i.e. nutrientes, \n\nclorofila, temperatura, salinidade, turbidez, dados de vento e de sat\u00e9lite), e \u00e0s caracteristicas \n\nsedimentol\u00f3gicas dos fundos marinhos (i.e. composi\u00e7\u00e3o, textura e acumula\u00e7\u00e3o sedimentar). \n\nAs varia\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas mais significativas observadas nas comunidades de coc\u00f3litoforos \n\nao largo de Portugal ocorreram ao longo do gradiente costa-oceano. Dois grupos taxon\u00f3micos \n\nprincipais de comportamento ecol\u00f3gico oposto foram observados na zona f\u00f3tica, marcando a \n\ntransi\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies adaptadas a regimes mais est\u00e1veis (K-selected) preferencialmente \n\ndistribu\u00eddas no dom\u00ednio oce\u00e2nico, para esp\u00e9cies oportunistas (r-selected) mais frequentes nas \n\nregi\u00f5es neritico-costeiras. Este gradiente tamb\u00e9m foi observado nas associa\u00e7\u00f5es de coc\u00f3litos \n\npreservadas nos sedimentos superficiais do fundo marinho, tanto ao longo dos canh\u00f5es \n\nsubmarinos como nas suas \u00e1reas adjacentes, embora v\u00e1rias diferen\u00e7as tenham sido reconhecidas \n\nentre os dois tipos de ambientes. \n\nNa zona f\u00f3tica, as esp\u00e9cies Emiliania huxleyi e Gephyrocapsa oceanica revelaram um \n\ncomportamento claramente r-selected, tendo sido as principais respons\u00e1veis pelo bloom de \n\ncocolit\u00f3foros observado ao largo do Cabo Carvoeiro. Este bloom ocorreu em resposta \u00e0 \n\ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o favor\u00e1vel de descarga fluvial de final de inverno com ventos predominantes de \n\nnorte sobre a plataforma, e condi\u00e7\u00f5es de c\u00e9u limpo. Em apenas alguns dias, as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ncocolit\u00f3foros e biomassa de fitopl\u00e2ncton (Chl-a) mais do que triplicaram, indicando claramente \n\na capacidade destes organismos em tirar partido das condi\u00e7\u00f5es favor\u00e1veis em luz e nutrientes \n\nprovidenciadas pela pluma fluvial superficial. As duas esp\u00e9cies desenvolveram-se em conjunto \n\ncom outros fitopl\u00e2nct\u00f3nicos oportunistas (Chaetoceros s.l., Thalassiosira s.l, Skeletonema s.l.), \n\nconfirmando o seu papel enquanto esp\u00e9cies r-selected de primeiro est\u00e1dio da sucess\u00e3o \n\nfitoplanct\u00f3nica, caracterizadas por terem um potencial de desenvolvimento r\u00e1pido em ambientes \n\nricos em nutrientes. Coronosphaera mediterranea e Syracolithus dalmaticus tamb\u00e9m \n\nresponderam positivamente \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es favor\u00e1veis no decorrer do cruzeiro, embora menos \n\nnotavelmente do que as esp\u00e9cies anteriores. Pelo contr\u00e1rio, os grupos Syracosphaera spp. e \n\nOphiaster spp. revelaram caracter\u00edsticas t\u00edpicas de esp\u00e9cies K-selected, consistentemente mais \n\nabundantes em \u00e1guas mais oce\u00e2nicas e menos eutr\u00f3ficas, afastadas da influ\u00eancia da pluma \n\nfluvial, ou distribu\u00eddas em n\u00edveis abaixo da pluma nas regi\u00f5es mais neritico-costeiras. \n\nGephyrocapsa ericsonii e Gephyrocapsa muellerae dominaram a comunidade de cocolit\u00f3foros \n\nsob condi\u00e7\u00f5es de baixa produtividade na plataforma, mas n\u00e3o quando as \u00e1guas de regi\u00f5es \n\nner\u00edtico-costeiras se tornaram favor\u00e1veis ao bloom de esp\u00e9cies oportunistas. \n\n\n\nResumo \n\n 14 \n\nNo sedimento superficial de fundo, enquanto as esp\u00e9cies C. mediterranea, Helicosphaera \n\ncarteri e a G. oceanica (e, em menor grau, Coccolithus pelagicus) registaram uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmarcadamente costeira, os coc\u00f3litos produzidos pelas esp\u00e9cies Calcidiscus leptoporus, \n\nUmbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera irregularis e Rhabdosphaera spp. foram observados \n\npreferencialmente distribuidos para offshore e para sul, possivelmente indicadoras de uma maior \n\ninflu\u00eancia da ENACWst na zona mais meridional da area de estudo (i.e. a sul do Espor\u00e3o da \n\nEstremadura). G. muellerae revelou ser, de longe, a esp\u00e9cie mais abundante e amplamente \n\ndistribu\u00edda, embora geralmente mais oce\u00e2nica, particularmente nas regi\u00f5es adjacentes aos \n\ncanh\u00f5es submarinos. Enquanto certas especies mais robustas (i.e. C. leptoporus, C. pelagicus, \n\nH. carteri) tiveram um registo mais relevante no sedimento em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com a coluna de \n\n\u00e1gua, g\u00e9neros de morfologia mais fr\u00e1gil e de menores dimens\u00f5es (i.e. Syracosphaera spp., \n\nOphiaster spp., S. dalmaticus) n\u00e3o foram observadas no sedimento, provavelmente traduzindo \n\nos efeitos da dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o e fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o selectiva. No entanto, quando considerando \n\npercentagens de esp\u00e9cies de coc\u00f3litos de dimens\u00e3o semelhante (?3 \u00b5m), n\u00e3o foi observada \n\nqualquer evid\u00eancia mais consistente de que tenha havido transporte ou preserva\u00e7\u00e3o preferencial \n\nde especies individuais, confirmando que o signal preservado no sedimento apresenta uma forte \n\ncomponente (paleo)ecol\u00f3gica, e n\u00e3o meramente tafon\u00f3mica. \n\nEm termos de din\u00e2mica de canh\u00e3o submarino, o Canh\u00e3o da Nazar\u00e9 foi observado a ter o \n\nefeito de conduta preferencial de \u00e1guas oce\u00e2nicas para regi\u00f5es bastante proximais da plataforma \n\ncontinental Portuguesa, as quais se encontravam empobrecidas em nutrientes em compara\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncom as massas de \u00e1gua ner\u00edticas e costeiras durante o per\u00edodo de final de inverno monitorizado \n\ndurante o cruzeiro. A ocorr\u00eancia singular de Discosphaera tubifera e Palusphaera vandelii na \n\ncabeceira do canh\u00e3o, juntamente com C. leptoporus \u00e9 interpretada enquanto tra\u00e7adora do \n\ndeslocamento preferencial de ENACWst intensificado ao longo do tro\u00e7o superior do canh\u00e3o, \n\ndurante o inverno. Um \u201chotspot\u201d de diversidade de cocolit\u00f3foros foi observado na coluna de \n\n\u00e1gua desta \u00e1rea, incluindo tanto esp\u00e9cies oce\u00e2nicas-oligotr\u00f3ficas como esp\u00e9cies costeiras \n\noportunistas, tendo sido interpretado enquanto reflexo da capacidade do canh\u00e3o em promover \n\ntrocas de massas de \u00e1gua entre regi\u00f5es neritico-costeiras e regi\u00f5es mais oce\u00e2nicas, \n\nparticularmente durante o inverno. Adicionalmente, a persistente ocorr\u00eancia de elevadas \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de Chl-a \u00e0 superf\u00edcie obtidas por imagens de sat\u00e9lite, particularmente entre \n\nMar\u00e7o e Outubro (2006-2011), sugerem a cabeceira do Canh\u00e3o da Nazar\u00e9 como sendo o sector \n\nmais persistentemente produtivo do tro\u00e7o superior-m\u00e9dio do canh\u00e3o. Percentagens mais \n\nelevadas de coc\u00f3litos de esp\u00e9cies costeiro-neriticas em sedimentos da parte superior do Canh\u00e3o \n\nda Nazar\u00e9 corroboram esta hip\u00f3tese, possivelmente traduzindo a forte proximidade da sua \n\ncabeceira \u00e0 linha de costa, resultando numa maior influ\u00eancia da din\u00e2mica costeira e na sua \n\nintensifica\u00e7\u00e3o na cabeceira e \u00e1rea adjacente (i.e. upwelling, ondas internas), e em condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nmais din\u00e2micas e ricas em nutrientes para as quais as esp\u00e9cies r-selected est\u00e3o melhor \n\nadaptadas.  \n\nPelo contr\u00e1rio, percentagens mais elevadas de coc\u00f3litos de esp\u00e9cies oce\u00e2nicas no Canh\u00e3o \n\nde Lisboa-Set\u00fabal parecem traduzir um ambiente em geral mais oce\u00e2nico-pel\u00e1gico neste \n\n\n\nResumo \n\n 15 \n\ncanh\u00e3o, resultante da sua maior dist\u00e2ncia aos efeitos da din\u00e2mica costeira e aus\u00eancia de \n\ntransporte sedimentar significativo ao longo do seu talvegue, na actualidade. \n\nUma mistura mais acentuada de coc\u00f3litos produzidos pelas duas associa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\n(paleo)ecol\u00f3gicas, i.e. a costeiro-neritica e a oce\u00e2nica, foi observada nos sedimentos dos \n\ncanh\u00f5es, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com as regi\u00f5es da plataforma e vertente regi\u00f5es adjacentes aos \n\ncanh\u00f5es onde o gradiente (paleo)ecol\u00f3gico costa-oceano \u00e9 mais distintivo. Esta assinatura nos \n\ncanh\u00f5es confirma a capacidade destas estrutura em promover trocas de massas de \u00e1gua costeiras \n\ne oce\u00e2nicas (sinal ecol\u00f3gico), embora o importante papel das ondas internas e dos ocasionais \n\nfluxos grav\u00edticos de sedimentos em perturbar e homogeneizar o registo sedimentar (sinal \n\ntafon\u00f3mico) nos canh\u00f5es deva ser sempre considerado. \n\nAo evitar os problemas estat\u00edsticos tipicamente associados \u00e0s determina\u00e7\u00f5es percentuais, \n\na An\u00e1lise de Dados Composicionais (i.e. a abordagem isometric log-ratio) permitiu validar e \n\nconfirmar o gradiente ecol\u00f3gico costa-oceano observado nas associa\u00e7\u00f5es de coc\u00f3litos no \n\nsedimento. A boa concord\u00e2ncia entre os dois m\u00e9todos sugere que o sinal (paleo)ecol\u00f3gico \n\npreservado na cobertura sedimentar da margem Portuguesa central \u00e9 robusto, mesmo junto \u00e0 \n\ncosta e no contexto das condi\u00e7\u00f5es din\u00e2micas vigentes nos canh\u00f5es submarinos. \n\nPelo contr\u00e1rio, tanto as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de coc\u00f3litos (nanno/g) como os fluxos \n\n(nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) revelaram padr\u00f5es de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial onde as rela\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas inter-\n\nesp\u00e9cies parecem estar \u201cmascaradas\u201d por factores sedimentares/tafon\u00f3micos, particularmente \n\nnas zonas costeiras e nos canh\u00f5es. O aumento de coc\u00f3litos para offshore reflecte n\u00e3o s\u00f3 a \n\nnatureza primordialmente oce\u00e2nica dos cocolit\u00f3foros, mas tamb\u00e9m a ocorr\u00eancia de selec\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ntextural, resultando na acumula\u00e7\u00e3o preferencial de coc\u00f3litos em regi\u00f5es menos energ\u00e9ticas da \n\nvertente continental m\u00e9dia e inferior, e em certas zonas dos canh\u00f5es as quais funcionam como \n\narmadilhas morfol\u00f3gicas tempor\u00e1rias de sedimentos. Fluxos mais elevados nos tro\u00e7os superiores \n\ndos canh\u00f5es reflectem o seu papel enquanto depocentros preferenciais de sedimentos finos na \n\nplataforma continental, tanto de origem litog\u00e9nica como biog\u00e9nica, incluindo coc\u00f3litos \n\nprovenientes de fluxos verticais (produtividade \u2013 sinal ecol\u00f3gico) e laterais (resuspens\u00e3o e \n\nadvec\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 sinal tafon\u00f3mico). \n\nEste estudo ilustra cabalmente a rapidez de resposta dos cocolit\u00f3foros a varia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nmeteorol\u00f3gicas e hidrogr\u00e1ficas de curto-prazo e ao surgimento de condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais \n\nfavor\u00e1veis na costa Portuguesa, contrariando a no\u00e7\u00e3o amplamente aceite de que estes \n\norganismos representam um grupo fitoplanct\u00f3nico calc\u00e1rio uniforme t\u00edpico de ambientes de \n\nbaixa turbul\u00eancia, baixo conte\u00fado nutritivo e intensa luminosidade. Embora haja ainda muito \n\ntrabalho a fazer no que respeita ao impacto dos canh\u00f5es submarinos sobre a din\u00e2mica \n\noceanogr\u00e1fica e fitoplanct\u00f3nica ao largo de Portugal, as associa\u00e7\u00f5es de coc\u00f3litos preservados no \n\nsedimento revelaram-se \u00fateis enquanto tra\u00e7adores de gradientes (paleo)ecol\u00f3gicos e \n\n(paleo)oceanogr\u00e1ficos vigentes na margem Portuguesa central. Os resultados confirmam estudos \n\nanteriores focados na complexa din\u00e2mica hidro-sedimentar vigente nos canh\u00f5es submarinos da \n\nNazar\u00e9 e de Lisboa-Set\u00fabal. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 17 \n\nAbstract \n \n\nThis thesis aims to contribute to the knowledge of coccolithophores from coastal-neritic-\n\noceanic transitional settings, their distribution offshore central Portugal, and their potential as \n\n(paleo)ecological and (paleo)ceanographic proxy in the context of submarine canyons. In order \n\nto achieve a good understanding of the relationship of coccolithophores with the environmental \n\nsetting, results were interpreted on a multidisciplinary basis, integrating a significant data set \n\nconcerning the hydrological characteristics of surface waters of the central Portuguese margin \n\n(i.e. nutrients, chlorophyll, temperature, salinity, turbidity, wind data) and seabed \n\nsedimentological characteristics (i.e. sediment bulk composition, particle size and sediment \n\naccumulation).  \n\nThe most striking variations in phytoplankton communities off central Portugal occurred \n\nalong the coastal-oceanic lateral gradient. Two principal groups of taxa of opposite ecological \n\nbehaviour were observed in the photic layer, with K-selected taxa preferentially distributed in \n\nthe open ocean, and r-selected taxa preferentially occurring in more coastal-neritic regions. Such \n\ngradient was also reflected in coccolith assemblages preserved in surface sediments on the \n\nseabed, both along the submarine canyons and on the adjacent shelf and slope areas, although \n\nseveral differences were noticed between the two environments. \n\nIn the photic layer, Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica exhibited the typical \n\nbehaviour of r-selected species, being the main responsible for a coccolithophore bloom \n\noccurring in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon region (off Cape Carvoeiro). This bloom occurred in response \n\nto late winter continental runoff combined with northerly winds prevailing over the shelf, under \n\nclear sky conditions. Within a few days, coccolithophore cell densities and associated \n\nphytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) more than tripled, indicating that phytoplankton was taking \n\nprofit from favourable nutrient and light conditions provided by the superficial buoyant plume. \n\nThe two species were developing together with other opportunistic phytoplankton genera \n\n(Chaetoceros s.l., Thalassiosira s.l, Skeletonema s.l.), confirming their role as early succession \n\nr-selected taxa, capable of rapid growth within nutrient-rich environments. Coronosphaera \n\nmediterranea and Syracolithus dalmaticus also responded to the favourable conditions, but less \n\nso than E. huxleyi and G. oceanica. On the contrary, Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. \n\nrevealed typical characteristics of K-selected species, being consistently more abundant in more \n\noceanic and less eutrophic waters, away from the influence of river runoff, and extending well \n\nbelow the nutrient-rich surface layer in the more coastal-neritic regions. Gephyrocapsa ericsonii \n\nand Gephyrocapsa muellerae dominated the coccolithophore community under steady-state \n\nlow-productive conditions over the shelf, until shelf and coastal waters became favourable for r-\n\nselected species to bloom. \n\nIn the seafloor sediment, coccoliths from C. mediterranea, Helicosphaera carteri and G. \n\noceanica (and to a lesser extent, Coccolithus pelagicus) exhibited a markedly coastal \n\ndistribution, whereas coccoliths from Calcidiscus leptoporus, Umbilicosphaera sibogae, \n\nUmbellosphaera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. were preferentially distributed further \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\n 18 \n\noffshore and southwards, possibly tracing the preferential onflow of ENACWst into the \n\nsouthern part of the central Portuguese shelf (i.e. south of Estremadura spur). G. muellerae was \n\nby far the most abundant and broadly distributed species in the sediment, with highest \n\nabundances in the more oceanic areas, particularly outside the canyons. Whereas larger and \n\nmore robust coccolith species (i.e. C. leptoporus, C. pelagicus, H. carteri) were better \n\nrepresented in the sediment in comparison to the overlying water column, smaller and more \n\ndelicate species from the genera Syracosphaera spp., Ophiaster spp. and S. dalmaticus were not \n\nfound in the sediments, most likely due to selective dissolution and breaking. Yet, considering \n\nthe coccolith species assemblage preserved in the sediment, no consistent evidence for selective \n\ntransport or preservation of individual taxa in relation to coccolith size was found, strongly \n\nsuggesting the signal within the sediment is mostly (paleo)ecological rather than merely \n\ntaphonomical.  \n\nIn terms of canyon dynamics, the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon was observed to act as a preferential \n\nconduit for oceanic waters into very proximal regions of the Portuguese shelf, which were \n\nnutrient-depleted in comparison to neritic and coastal water masses during the monitored late \n\nwinter period. The single occurrence of Discosphaera tubifera and Palusphaera vandelii in this \n\nproximal area, together with C. leptoporus, is interpreted as tracing the onflow of ENACWst \n\nintensified along the upper canyon during winter. A coccolithophore diversity \u201chotspot\u201d was \n\nnoticed in the canyon head, including both oligotrophic-oceanic and opportunistic-coastal taxa, \n\ninterpreted as reflecting the canyon\u2019s capacity to promote exchange of water masses between \n\nneritic-coastal and oceanic regions during winter. In addition, Chl-a time series obtained from \n\nsatellite data (2006-2011) revealed that the canyon head is often the stage of high productivity \n\nbetween March and October, which makes this region the most persistently productive part of \n\nthe upper-middle canyon and nearby shelf. Highest percentages of coastal-neritic coccoliths in \n\nsediments from the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon support this hypothesis, possibly reflecting the greater \n\nproximity of the head of this canyon to the coastline. The stronger influence of coastal dynamics \n\nand their intensification in this area (i.e. upwelling, internal waves), gives rise to more dynamic \n\nand nutrient-rich conditions to which r-selected coccolithophore species are better adapted.  \n\nOn the contrary, higher percentages of coccoliths from oceanic taxa in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon suggest that a generally more oceanic-pelagic environment prevails in this canyon, \n\nexplained by its greater distance from coastal dynamics and present-day lack of down-canyon \n\nsediment transport. Enhanced percentages of G. muellerae in the upper Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon \n\nmay be indicating preferential onflow of oceanic water masses through the canyon and/or up-\n\ncanyon transport of resuspended coccoliths in the bottom boundary layer. \n\nMore pronounced mixing of coccoliths from both coastal-neritic and oceanic coccolith \n\nassemblages was observed in sediments from the canyons, in comparison to the canyons \n\nadjacent shelf-slope regions where the coast-ocean (paleo)ecological gradient is more \n\ndistinctive, confirming the capacity of these structures in promoting the exchange between \n\ncoastal and oceanic water masses (ecological signal). Nevertheless, the role of internal tides and \n\noccasional sediment gravity flows in disturbing and homogenizing the sedimentary record \n\nwithin canyons (taphonomical signal) should also be considered. \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\n 19 \n\nWhile avoiding the major statistical problems potentially associated with percentages, \n\nCompositional Data Analysis involving the use of isometric log-ratios allowed validation of \n\ncoast-to-ocean ecological trends determined from sediment coccolith percentages. The good \n\nagreement between the two methods suggests that the coccolith (paleo)ecological signal \n\npreserved in sediments of the central Portuguese margin is robust, even near the coast and in the \n\ncontext of the highly dynamic submarine canyons. \n\nOn the contrary, both coccolith concentrations (nanno/g) and fluxes (nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) \n\nshowed spatial trends in which ecological inter-relationships appear to be masked by \n\nsedimentary/taphonomical factors, especially towards the coast and in the submarine canyons. \n\nThe general increase of coccoliths further offshore reflects the oceanic nature of \n\ncoccolithophores, but also physical sorting, resulting in preferential accumulation of coccoliths \n\nwithin finer-grained hemipelagic sediments that accumulate in more calm environments of the \n\nmiddle and lower slope and in certain parts of the canyons acting as temporary sediment \n\nmorphological traps. Highest coccolith fluxes in the upper canyons reflect their role as \n\npreferential depocenters of fine-grained particles both lithogenic and biogenic. Biogenic fine \n\nparticles include coccoliths from vertical (productivity - ecological signal) and lateral fluxes \n\n(resuspension and advection \u2013 taphonomical signal). \n\n This study strikingly illustrates the rapid response of coccolithophores to short-term \n\nmeteorological and hydrographic variability creating favourable conditions for growth off \n\ncentral Portugal. These results contradict the accepted notion of coccolithophores being a \n\nuniform functional group of calcifying phytoplankton thriving in low-turbulence, low-nutrients \n\nand high-light environments. Whereas much work still needs to be done concerning the impact \n\nof the canyons on both oceanography and phytoplankton dynamics off central Portugal, \n\ncoccoliths preserved in the seabed sediment appeared to be useful tracers of the prevailing \n\n(paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographic trends. The results support previous studies focused \n\non the complex hydro-sedimentary dynamics prevailing in the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\ncanyons.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1 \n\nGeneral Introduction \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 23 \n\nChapter 1  \n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n1.1. Coccolithophores \n\nCoccolithophores are marine, unicellular phytoplankton organisms, belonging to the \n\nKingdom Chromista, phylum Haptophyta and division Prymnesiophyceae. They represent the \n\nmain component of extant calcareous nannoplankton (Jordan and Chamberlain, 1997; Jordan et \n\nal., 2004). Coccolithophores are one of the main groups of marine phytoplankton, \n\ndistinguishable from other groups by the presence of a calcified exoskeleton at some stage in \n\ntheir life cycle, composed of numerous minute calcified scales (1-16 \u00b5m across), the coccoliths. \n\nThese coccoliths, produced by biomineralization of minuscule calcite crystals arranged \n\naccording to characteristic arrays, exhibit morphological and optical patterns that have \n\ntaxonomic and phylogenetic meaning (Pienaar, 1994; Young, 1994).  \n\nCoccolithophores are among the most important pelagic calcifying organisms in the \n\nmoderns oceans (Baumann et al., 2004; Hay, 2004). Their coccoliths abound in seafloor \n\nsediments and present one of the most abundant and continuous fossil records since the Late \n\nTriassic to the present day (e.g. Bown et al., 2004). Coccoliths preserved in the geological \n\narchive store valuable information on (palaeo)environmental conditions from the photic zone \n\n(McIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967; Roth, 1994; Baumann et al., 2000; Boeckel and Baumann, 2008) and \n\nthus can be used as indicators of paleoceanographic processes, sea surface water masses, \n\nproductivity and climate change (e.g. Beaufort et al., 2001; 2011; Flores et al., 2000; Ziveri et \n\nal., 2004; Silva et al., 2008). \n\nIt is estimated that about 20\u201360 % in weight of marine pelagic carbonate is produced by \n\ncoccolithophores (Brand, 1994; Winter et al., 1994). Coccoliths are, by far, the most common \n\n(sub)fossil structure than can be found in a simple smear of ocean sediment, particularly in \n\noozes. Therefore, coccolithophores are not only important in the marine ecosystem as primary \n\nproducers, but also as contributors of inorganic carbon to the marine carbonate pump (Bown, \n\n1998; Rost and Riebesell, 2004). In addition, they are likely to produce additional feedback on \n\nglobal climate due to enhanced albedo resulting from the highly reflective masses of detached \n\ncoccoliths and production of dimethylsulphonium propionate \u2013 DMSP, thought to play a role in \n\nreducing solar irradiation (Westbroek et al., 1993; Malin and Steinke, 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 24 \n\nMorphology and Biology \n\nThe taxonomy of coccolithophores is based on the morphology and optical properties of \n\nthe coccoliths covering the cell. The crystallographic features of calcite are used to identify \n\ndifferent coccolithophore species, i.e. the birefringence and extinction patterns of calcite crystals \n\nwhen viewed in cross-polarized light, which are distinct for different coccolithophore genera \n\naccording to the specific crystallographic arrangement of their coccoliths (e.g. Young and \n\nBown, 1991). \n\nThere are two major groups of coccoliths:  the holococcoliths, composed of numerous \n\nminute euhedral calcite crystals, whose biomineralization is supposed to occur outside the cell; \n\nand the heterococcoliths, which are the most common forms in the sediment, composed of \n\nradially continuous series of variably shaped crystal units biomineralized intracellularly (see \n\nPiennar, 1994; Young et al., 1997; Young and Henrikson, 2003).  \n\nWithin these basic groups, a high morphological diversity is observed. Among the \n\nheterococcoliths, the most important morphological categories are: placoliths (e.g. Emiliania \n\nhuxelyi, Gephyrocapsa spp., Coccolithus pelagicus s.l., Calcidiscus leptoporus, \n\nUmbilicosphaera sibogae), helicoliths (e.g. Helicosphaera carteri), caneoliths (e.g. \n\nSyracosphaera spp., Ophiaster spp., Coronosphaera mediterranea) and rhabdoliths \n\n(Rhabdosphaera spp., Discosphaera tubifera) (see Young et al., 1997; Cros, 2000) (Figure 1.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 - Examples of different types of coccospheres and coccoliths (http://www.geo.uni-bremen.de). \n\nThe term \u201cnannoliths\u201d refers to nannofossils which are thought to be related to coccolithophores, but \n\nexhibiting structures that are neither heterococcoliths nor holococcoliths (e.g. Braarudosphaera \n\nbigelowi). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.geo.uni-bremen.de/\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 25 \n\nCoccolithophore cells may have coccoliths that are all of the same size and morphology, \n\nbut they may also have different coccolith forms (i.e. dimorphism and polymorphism e.g. \n\nSyracosphaera spp.) and sizes. Most coccolithophores have different types of coccoliths for \n\ndistinct life-stages (e.g. C. pelagicus s.l.) (see Piennar, 1994). In most cases, coccoliths are \n\narranged in a single layer outside the body organic scales, whereas some taxa may exhibit two \n\ndistinct layers of heterococcoliths of different types (i.e. dithecatism) (Cros, 2000). Others \n\nproduce multi-layered coccospheres composed of numerous uniform coccoliths (e.g. E. huxleyi) \n\n(see Billard and Inouye, 2004). \n\nVarious explanations have been given for the function of coccoliths: protection of the cell \n\nmembrane, protection from predation, cellular buffering, ballast for increasing sinking rate, \n\naiding nutrient absorption in turbulent environments (e.g. placolith-bearing taxa), enhancing \n\nsurface area to decrease sinking in low turbulence environments (e.g. spines and spiral \n\ncoccoliths), light focusing aiding photosynthesis in low-light environments (see Young, 1994). \n\nThe high morphological diversity of coccoliths and coccospheres may also reflect distinctive \n\necological strategies preferred by different coccolithophore taxa; e.g. placolith-bearing taxa are \n\nmore associated to eutrophic environments, such as upwelling areas and shelf-seas, where light \n\nand nutrient levels are favourable for rapid population growth (r-selected), whereas \n\n\u201cumbelliform\u201d taxa are more often associated to low-latitude oligotrophic environments (K-\n\nselected) (see Young, 1994) (Figure 1.2) . \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013Ecological distribution of coccolithophore types representing a transect from continental shelf \n\nto mid-ocean at low latitudes. Arrows represent nutrient supply driven from river runoff and coastal \n\nupwelling between the continental shelf and slope. Dashed lines are delimiting the lower photic zone \n\n(adapted from Young, 1994). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe life cycle of coccolithophores is heteromorphic, with alternating haploid (mobile and \n\nflagellate) and diploid generations (non-mobile, without flagellates), produced by mitotic \n\ndivision and syngamy, respectively (Figure 1.3). Typically, diploid cells produce \n\nheterococcoliths, whereas haploid cells produce holococcoliths (see Billard and Inouye, 2004; \n\nHoudan et al., 2003). \u201cCombination coccospheres\u201d composed of both types of coccoliths are \n\ninterpreted as cells that were captured right after a life-cycle transition (Cros et al., 2000; Geisen \n\net al, 2002; Frada et al., 2009). Whereas little is known yet about the factors that trigger phase \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 26 \n\nchanges in coccolithophores, it has been proposed that phase changes represent an evolutionary \n\nmechanism for genetic recombination in marine planktonic organisms that are forced to deal \n\nwith constantly changing environmental conditions (Baumann et al., 2005). Other authors have \n\nproposed that their ability to grow under two phases may have a primary ecological \n\nsignificance, either as strategy for a species to exploit a wider range of environmental conditions \n\n(e.g. Cros et al., 2000), and/or to rapidly escape negative selection pressures carried on one \n\nstage, such as grazing, parasitic attack or viral infections (Frada et al., 2008), or abrupt \n\nenvironmental changes (Noel et al., 2004). \n\nReproduction rates observed in the laboratory were highest for Emiliania huxleyi (up to \n\n2.7 divisions per day), followed by Gephyrocapsa oceanica and Calcidiscus leptoporus (1.2 \n\ndiv. per day) (Brand, 1982). Field observations by Cach\u00e3o and Moita (2000) indicated a growth \n\nrate of 1.4 divisions per day for Coccolithus pelagicus during a moderate upwelling event \n\noffshore Portugal. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Schematic illustration of coccolithophorid life cycles. Diploid and haploid phases produce \n\nheterococcoliths and holococcoliths, respectively, here illustrated by scanning electron microscope \n\nimages of Calcidiscus leptoporus (left) and Calcidiscus quadriperforatus (right), respectively. The \n\ncombination coccosphere shown in the middle, which has both types of coccoliths, represents a transition \n\nfrom haploid to diploid phase (from Young and Henriksen, 2003).  \n\n \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 27 \n\nEcology and Biogeography \n\nCoccolithophores, like all other photosynthesizing plankton groups, are restricted to the \n\nphotic zone of the oceans. Within this upper ocean layer, turbulence is important in controlling \n\naccess of phytoplankton to light and nutrient. According to the \u201cMargalef Mandala\u201d, which \n\nclassifies phytoplankton groups in terms of their response to nutrients vs. turbulence following a \n\nmixing event, coccolithophores occupy an intermediate position between diatoms, \u2013 fast-\n\ngrowing r-selected organisms adapted to profit from nutrient availability in eutrophic and \n\nturbulent environments -, and dinoflagellates \u2013 slower-growing K-selected organisms adapted to \n\nstratified, low-nutrient environments ( Margalef, 1978) (Figure 1.4). However, the \u201cMargalef \n\nMandala\u201d was mostly based on the ecological behavior of E. huxleyi, which is nowadays known \n\nto be a somewhat atypical coccolithophore, often acting as an early succession r-selected species \n\nand reported to produce extensive blooms in various regions of the ocean (e.g. Winter et al., \n\n1994; Tyrell and Merico, 2004; Souza et al., 2011).  \n\nAs a group, the coccolithophores are considered to be K-selected, as they reach their \n\nhighest diversity and relative abundance within the phytoplankton community in warm, \n\nstratified oligotrophic waters from low and middle latitude regions, as opposed to eutrophic \n\nenvironments such as coastal-neritic waters, where they are less diverse and surpassed in \n\nabundance by diatoms (e.g. McIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967; Winter et al., 1994; Brand, 1994; Ziveri et \n\nal., 2004). Nevertheless, several taxa reveal a clear r-selected behaviour, e.g. placolith-bearing \n\ntaxa such as E. huxleyi and G. oceanica, as indicated by their occurrence in blooms in the \n\noceans (e.g. Knappertsbusch and Brummer, 1995; Souza et al., 2011) (Figure 1.5), and within \n\nturbulent coastal and mature upwelled waters (e.g. Ziveri et al., 1995; Baumann et al., 2000; \n\nCach\u00e3o and Moita, 2000; Moita, 2001; Moita et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2008). Overall, \n\ncoccolithophore species appear to be distributed along nutrient gradients from the eutrophic \n\ncoastal and polar regions to oligotrophic central gyres, thus reflecting r- and K-selection \n\nbiological characteristics respectively (Brand, 1994). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013Margalef\u2019s Mandala (Margalef, 1978) re-drawn by Balch (2004) \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 28 \n\nThe general biogeography and habitat characteristics of coccolithophores are known from \n\nplankton and seafloor sediment surveys (McIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967; Brand, 1994; Roth, 1994; \n\nWinter et al., 1994; Young, 1994; Ziveri et al., 2004). Temperature controls the largest-oceanic \n\nscale distribution following broad latitudinally defined biogeographical zones related with the \n\nmajor oceanic water masses (McIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967; Winter et al., 1994). Five major floral \n\nzones have previously been defined by McIntyre and B\u00e9 (1967): Subarctic/antarctic, Temperate, \n\nSubtropical and Tropical. This broad-scale zonation, however, does not take into account local \n\nphenomena such as coastal currents, gyres, eddies, upwelling, river runoff, which regionally \n\naffect their distribution (Cach\u00e3o and Moita, 2000; Andruleit et al., 2003; Ziveri et al., 2004; \n\nAndruleit, 2007; Silva et al., 2008; Guerreiro et al., 2013 \u2013 see Chapter 2).  \n\nChanges in temperature will most likely affect sub-polar and temperate populations \n\nwhose ecology is dependent on the seasonal thermocline, as opposed to species from subtropical \n\nregions where a permanent thermocline is present: whereas coccolithophore species are present \n\nin the tropics during the entire year, in temperate regions, they are only abundant in spring-\n\nsummer (e.g. Brand, 1994; Andruleit et al., 2003). Whereas most coccolithophore species \n\npreferentially dwell in the upper 50\u201380m of the photic layer, most species appear photo-\n\ninhibited very close to the surface. E. huxleyi, however, stands out for its tolerance to high light \n\nlevels, possibly contributing to its capacity to dominate coccolithophore assemblages (Tyrell \n\nand Merico, 2004). Other species of coccolithophores live almost exclusively between 100 and \n\n200 m, in the lower photic zone (e.g. Florisphaera profunda, see Brand, 1994).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 - Satellite image of an Emilinia huxleyi bloom in the English Channel off the coast of \n\nCornwall, 24 July 1999 (http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/soes/staff/tt/eh/satbloompics.html). \n\n \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 29 \n\nVertical Transport and Sedimentation  \n\nCoccoliths provide a particularly useful calibration link with ecological and \n\noceanographic conditions since they reflect the hydrological patterns persistent or strong enough \n\nto be preserved in the fossil record as revealed by several studies. Indeed, although subjected to \n\na variety of post-mortem (biostratonomical) processes after death of the coccolithophore cell, \n\nstudies indicate that coccolith thanatocoenosis in surface sediments can be closely related to the \n\ncoccolithophore communities dwelling in the overlying photic layer (e.g. Abrantes and Moita, \n\n1999; Baumann et al., 2000; 2005; Kinkel et al., 2000; Sprengel et al., 2002; Boeckel and \n\nBauman, 2008). Such is the particular case of heavier calcified and resistant forms (C. \n\nleptoporus, C. pelagicus, H. carteri), which have higher preservation potential, and high cell \n\ndensities species (E. huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa spp.) which are more abundant due to seasonal high \n\nproductivity (e.g. Baumann et al., 2000; Ziveri et al., 2004; Baumann et al., 2005; Boeckel and \n\nBaumann, 2008). This good correspondence, as well as the good preservation of coccoliths even \n\nin sediments below the calcite compensation depth, can be attributed to their rapid transfer from \n\nthe photic zone to the sediment through incorporation in fast-sinking faecal pellets produced by \n\ngrazing zooplankton and within marine snow aggregates (Roth, 1994; Steinmetz, 1994; Balch, \n\n2004). Otherwise, taking the very slow settling of individual coccoliths into account, being on \n\nthe order of a few cm per day, it would take a single coccolith on the order of a century to reach \n\nthe bottom of the ocean, making it very unlikely that it would escape from dissolution and \n\ndisplacement by currents far beyond the production area (see Steinmetz, 1994). Faecal pellets, \n\nin addition to providing rapid transport of intact coccospheres and individual coccoliths at \n\naverage sinking rates of 200 m/day, they also provide protection to coccoliths by enclosing them \n\nin an organic membrane that acts as a chemical barrier. Whereas one single pellet may carry \n\n100,000 coccoliths, the mismatch between coccoliths and coccospheres in sediment traps seems \n\nto be 3-4 order of magnitude (e.g. Broerse et al., 2000; Ziveri et al., 2000ab). This happens \n\nbecause the latter are fragile and easily disintegrate after organic membranes holding the \n\ncoccoliths together have been digested by herbivorous zooplankton or metabolized by bacteria \n\nduring transport to the seafloor, while lying on the seafloor, or after burial (Roth, 1994).  \n\nBecause of the importance of faecal pellets in the vertical transport of coccoliths, \n\ncoccolith-rich sediments are more commonly found below mixed, productive surface waters \n\nwhere coccoliths may not be the dominant phytoplankton group but where grazing is important, \n\nrather than below oligotrophic waters where coccolithophores are dominant but where grazers \n\nare less abundant (Balch, 2004). \n\nDespite the efficiency of faecal pellets in protecting coccoliths and accelerating their \n\nvertical transport, the correspondence between living coccolithophore communities and \n\ncoccolith assemblages preserved in the seabed is still complex. In the first place because the \n\nseabed sediment contains a time-integrated collection of the seasonally variable flux of \n\ncoccoliths arriving from the ocean surface layer. Subsequent bioturbation of the uppermost few \n\ncentimetres of sediment will easily mix coccoliths produced over a timespan of hundreds of \n\nyears. On top of that, resuspension of surface sediments by bottom currents may result in sorting \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 30 \n\nand selective destruction of coccoliths, whilst coccoliths from allochtonous production or \n\nreworked from older deposits may be introduced. The result will be a more or less homogenised \n\ncoccolith taphocoenosis. The gradual loss of primary ecological information occurring from the \n\ninitial production of coccolithophores in the photic layer until the final incorporation of \n\ncoccoliths in the sedimentary record was well illustrated by studies performed in the Arabian \n\nSea, where coccolithophore species composition in water samples, sediment trap samples and \n\nsurface sediments were compared (Andruleit et al., 2003; Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; \n\nBaumann et al., 2005). The study demonstrated that the great variability in plankton samples \n\nwas not preserved in the annual cycle from the sediment traps, whereas the annual mean \n\ncomposition from the traps closely resembled the sedimentary record, which represented a \n\nmixed signal of intra-annual species succession. According to these authors, the good \n\ncorrespondence of species composition and relative abundance between the annual mean of \n\nsediment trap samples and surface sediments suggests that the information record from the traps \n\nis likely to be transformed into the sediment almost without biases in the species relative \n\nabundances (Baumann et al., 2005).  \n\n \n\n \n\nCoccoliths as (paleo)ecological proxies in coastal regions  \n\nWhereas coccolithophores are generally studied in the oceanic domain where the highest \n\nconcentrations and diversity occur, several studies demonstrated the ability of this group to \n\nprofit from the high nutrient conditions driven by coastal upwelling and river runoff (e.g. \n\nCach\u00e3o and Moita, 2000; Silva et al., 2008; Guerreiro et al., 2013 \u2013 Chapter 2). However, the \n\nrelationship between living communities and coccolith species assemblages preserved in the \n\nseabed may be particularly complex within shallower marine environments such as continental \n\nshelves (e.g. Steinmetz, 1994; Roth, 1994).  \n\nDilution by terrigenous material and dissolution caused by oxidation of organic matter in \n\nsediments are additional factors that affect the concentration and composition of coccolith \n\nassemblages in sediments from shallow marginal seas (Roth, 1994). In addition, the increasing \n\nbottom water hydrodynamics towards the coast will expectedly have a major control on \n\ncoccolith accumulation in the sediment; whereas winnowing by waves and currents hampers the \n\naccumulation of coccoliths in coarse-grained deposits of the shelf and upper slope, coccoliths \n\nwill preferentially accumulate in fine-grained hemipelagic deposits that accumulate in more \n\nquiescent environments of the middle and lower slope (see Chapter 4). Reworking of sub-fossil \n\nor fossil specimens by strong bottom currents in continental shelf and slope regions may also be \n\na problem when making ecological inferences from sediment coccolith assemblages (e.g. \n\nFerreira et al., 2008). Complexity further increases in heterogeneous and dynamic regions such \n\nas submarine canyons, where the factors above are known to be intensified (i.e. intensified \n\ncoastal dynamics; bottom resuspension by internal tides and gravity flows; De Stigter et al., \n\n2007; 2011). A deep knowledge of the oceanographic and sedimentary processes prevailing in \n\nthese areas is essential to study coccolith sedimentation in marginal-marine settings, for which a \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 31 \n\nclose cooperation between nannoplankton specialists and physical, chemical and biological \n\noceanographers, and marine sedimentologists is required. \n\n \n\n \n\nCoccolithophores off central Portugal  \n\nThe first study on the coccolithophores off Portugal was based on the coccoliths \n\nsedimentary record from shelf-to-slope transects in the Portuguese margin, performed by \n\nCach\u00e3o (1993), revealing a general increase of coccolith species diversity further south. \n\nHighlights from this study refer to the tendency of Calcidiscus leptoporus and Rhabdosphaera \n\nspp. to decrease their relative abundance towards the coast, whereas Gephyrocapsa spp. was \n\nmore generally abundant in neritic-coastal regions, and Helicosphaera carteri was more \n\nabundant north of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. The increase of H. carteri further north was later \n\nsupported by both sediment and water column studies: an extremely high percentage of this \n\nspecies (~85 %) was found in sediments from the mouth of the Douro river by Guerreiro et al. \n\n(2005), interpreted as reflecting an opportunistic behaviour possibly related with locally \n\nconfined nutrient-rich conditions, whereas Moita et al. (2010) observed H. carteri being more \n\nabundant in the photic layer west of this river, during winter. \n\nAbrantes and Moita (1999) and Moita (2001) were the first to study the annual (summer-\n\nfall of 1985 to winter-spring of 1986) composition and seasonal spatial variation of \n\nphytoplankton in the Portuguese continental margin. According to these authors, diatoms were \n\nthe major phytoplankton group during upwelling conditions, whereas coccolithophores were \n\ndominant (>90 %) during winter, associated with warmer and nutrient-depleted subtropical \n\nwaters flowing onto the Portuguese shelf. Living coccolithophores revealed a broad distribution, \n\nbut more abundant south of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon in both summer and winter sampling periods. \n\nNorth of Nazar\u00e9, this group occurred mainly on the mid- and outer-shelf. The sediment record \n\nreflected not only the general north-south difference observed in the water column for both \n\nupwelling and non-upwelling situations, but also the summer water distribution (Abrantes and \n\nMoita, 1999). According to these authors, the sediment distribution pattern preserved most of \n\nthe original biological spatial variability independent of the sediment lithology and/or \n\nsedimentary processes acting on the Portuguese shelf, particularly concerning the record of \n\ncoccolithophores produced during blooms.  \n\nMore detailed analysis of the coccolithophores communities thriving off Portugal during \n\nwinter was later performed by Cach\u00e3o et al. (2000). The entrainment of subtropical water \n\nmasses, originating from south of the Azores Front into the Iberian Poleward Current during this \n\nperiod, was reflected in coccolithophore assemblages by the occurrence of subtropical species \n\nlike Algirosphaera quadricornu, Alveosphaera bimurata, Cyclolithus annulus, Florisphaera \n\nprofunda, Michaelsarsia elegans, Syracosphaeara lamina and Turrilithus latericioides, along \n\nwith temperate species like Gephyrocapsa muellerae, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Emiliania \n\nhuxleyi. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 32 \n\nCach\u00e3o and Moita (2000) brought new insights on the ecological preferences of C. \n\npelagicus, a formerly considered typical sub-arctic coccolithophore species. These authors \n\nobserved living C. pelagicus consistently associated to riverine plumes and shelf-break fronts \n\noff Portugal, and an increase of its coccolith abundances in surface sediment assemblages off \n\nDouro, Ave and C\u00e1vado rivers (NW Portugal). This was interpreted as reflecting a relation \n\nbetween C. pelagicus and moderate turbulence conditions combined with nutrient availability, \n\nproposing this species as a tracer of the periphery of areas of enhanced productivity. \n\nMorphometric analysis later performed by Parente et al. (2004) revealed the existence of three \n\nmorphotypes of C. pelagicus (s.l.), each revealing specific ecological features: the smaller-sized, \n\nrelated to C. pelagicus subsp. pelagicus, interpreted as a proxy of the influence of subpolar \n\nAtlantic water masses west of Portugal; the intermediate-size, related to C. pelagicus subsp. \n\nbraarudii, possibly related to coastal upwelling; and the larger, described as C. pelagicus subsp. \n\nazorinus, which seemed to indicate the influence of water masses driven directly from the \n\nAzores front.  \n\nMore recently, during a four years weekly survey, Silva et al. (2008) performed the first \n\nsystematic investigation of the coccolitophore assemblages from offshore Portugal. This study \n\nconfirmed the general preference of the group for non-upwelling conditions, although certain \n\nspecies appeared capable of withstanding coastal turbulence and well-adapted to the nutrient-\n\nrich coastal environment. A recurrent and distinct seasonal succession and interannual \n\ndifferences were observed, related with intensity and length of upwelling-downwelling seasons \n\n(and related temperature variations) and precipitation (and related salinity variations). \n\nAccording to these authors, Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa spp. revealed to be good \n\nproxies for coastal surface productivity waters as they responded quickly to a decrease in \n\nturbulence during upwelling events, in particular during spring and summer; G. muellerae and \n\nG. ericsonii were more abundant in colder waters associated with the beginning of the \n\nupwelling season, whereas Gephyrocapsa oceanica was more productive during summer; C. \n\npelagicus was also related to upwelling, possibly responding to shifts in the position of the Cape \n\nRoca filament relatively to Cascais position; Coronospheara mediterranea, Syracosphaera \n\npulchra, H. carteri and Rhabdosphaera clavigera revealed to be tracers of the onflow of \n\nsubtropical warmer and saltier waters over the shelf during the transition from upwelling to \n\ndownwelling season (e.g. Moita et al., 2010); finally, the oceanic preference of C. leptoporus \n\nwas confirmed, revealing to be a good tracer for the convergence of oceanic waters during \n\nwinter.  \n\nIn the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon area, a general characterization of the calcareous nannoplankton \n\nassemblages preserved in surface sediment samples carried out by Guerreiro et al. (2009) \n\nsuggested that the canyon\u2019s hydro-sedimentary dynamic regime may prevent the deposition \n\nand/or preservation of the smaller and fragile species (e.g. E. huxleyi and G. ericsonii), while \n\nenhancing the record of the larger ones (e.g. G. oceanica). Evidences of local enhanced \n\nproductivity are reported from near the canyon possibly related to persistent physical \n\nphenomena resultant from the canyon\u2019s morphology and proximity to the coast (e.g. solitary \n\ninternal waves; Quaresma et al., 2007), and/or upwelling enhancement in the canyon head . \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 33 \n\nThese hypotheses were later corroborated by a phytoplankton pigments study performed by \n\nMendes et al. (2011) in this region; maximum values of 19\u2019 hexanoyloxyfucoxantine, the \n\npigment used as a proxy for the coccolithophores, were found north of the canyon, and the \n\nmaximum values of chlorophyll-a were recorded in the inner shelf north of the canyon\u2019s head \n\nwhere the highest coccolith abundances were found.  \n\n \n\n1.2. Submarine canyons \n\nSubmarine canyons are prominent topographic features dissecting the seafloor of most of \n\nthe world\u2019s continental margins, cutting through all substrates, from unlithified sediment to \n\ncrystalline rock. Canyons typically start off on the shelf and upper slope as deeply incised \n\nvalleys generally with a V-shaped profile and with deep and steep, gullied slopes, gradually \n\nchanging to shallower valleys with U-shaped profile as depth increases. At the base of the \n\ncontinental slope a great decrease in the canyon wall height occurs, and often the canyon passes \n\ninto deep-sea channels bordered by natural levees (e.g. Shepard, 1964). Whereas some canyons \n\ncut across the shelf all the way to the coast, others may just indent the outer shelf. Coastal \n\ncanyons typically exhibit sizes comparable to those of Grand Canyon, i.e. width of ~10-30 km \n\nand depth ~2 km (Hickey, 1995) (see Figure 1.6). \n\nThe formation of submarine canyons results from a dynamic interplay of erosional and \n\ndepositional processes controlled by tectonics, terrestrial sediment input, and regional \n\noceanography (Shepard, 1981; Hickey, 1995; Lastras et al., 2009; Masson et al., 2011). Whereas \n\ncanyons are nowadays thought to evolve from localized small furrows on the upper slope along \n\nwhich slope instability and sediment failure in the form of gravity-driven flows eventually leads \n\nto their retrogressive development and enlargement (Pratson and Coakley, 1996; Arzola, 2008; \n\nLastras et al., 2009), a limited number of fundamental processes acting in different geological \n\nand geographic, climatological and oceanographic settings is likely to result on a wide range of \n\ndifferent canyon morphologies. Geomorphological and sedimentary observations reveal that \n\nmuch of their present-day morphology resulted from enhanced sediment transport during \n\nperiods of sea-level low stands, when the continental shelves were exposed and presented a \n\nbetter connectivity between fluvial systems and canyon heads (Normark and Piper, 1991).  \n\nDuring sea-level high stands, submergence of the shelf drastically reduced the role of \n\ncanyons as preferential pathways of coarse sediment towards to the deep-sea, resulting in \n\npredominant hemipelagic sedimentation (e.g. Weaver and Kuijpers, 1983; Canals et al., 2006; \n\nPalanques et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012), with much of the fine-grained and \n\norganic material transported being nowadays retained in the canyons\u2019 upper and middle sections \n\n(Van Weering et al., 2002; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011).  \n\nNevertheless, those canyons that are deeply incised into the continental shelf still preserve \n\na certain degree of activity, as they continue to receive and transport fine-grained sediments \n\nsupplied by coastal and shelf currents. Extreme river floods, strong storm events, dense water \n\ncascading and earthquakes are considered the most important triggers for the occurrence of \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 34 \n\nepisodic canyon-flushing events, able to carry sediments from the shelf down to the abyssal \n\nplain (e.g. Palanques et al., 2005; Canals et al., 2006; Palanques et al., 2005; De Stigter et al., \n\n2007; 2011; Martin et al., 2011; Masson et al., 2011).  \n\nClosely related to their impressive morphology, submarine canyons are complex, \n\nheterogeneous and highly dynamic marine environments. While linking the land intimately with \n\nthe deep ocean, canyons may act both as (1) temporary depositories of sediment particles and \n\norganic matter in transit along the coast and shelf, (2) preferential conduits through which the  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 \u2013 Scheme of a submarine canyon dissecting the continental shelf and slope (above) \n\n(Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc., 2006); bathymetric high-resolution maps of Monterey Canyon (off \n\nCalifornia, on the left) (http://www.mbari.org) and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (off Portugal, on the right) (data from \nPortuguese Hydrographic Institute).  \n\n \n\ntransport of particles between the coastal domain and the deep-sea is intensified (e.g. dense-\n\nwater cascading and gravity-driven flow events; Schmidt et al., 2001; Van Weering et al., 2002; \n\nOliveira et al., 2007; Canals et al., 2006; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011), and (3) modifiers of \n\ncoastal circulation, interrupting the along-slope geostrophic flow and thus leading to enhanced \n\nshelf-slope exchange of water and organic/inorganic matter (e.g. Hickey et al., 1986; Durrieu de \n\nMadron, 1994; Monaco et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2003). Canyons affecting water mass flow and \n\nsediment exchange between shallower and deeper regions have a strong impact on both pelagic \n\nand deep-sea benthic biological communities, often reflected in enhanced productivity and \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 35 \n\nspecies diversity (e.g. Hickey, 1995; Ryan et al., 2005; Tyler et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2011; \n\nContreras-Rosales et al., 2012; Morris et al., in press). \n\nMeasurements in submarine canyons are among the most difficult in the ocean mostly \n\ndue to their complex and heterogeneous topography and the extremely steep walls, and the \n\npresence of strong bottom currents (e.g. Hickey, 1997; Masson and Tyler, 2011). The \n\nintroduction of new geophysical techniques has been crucial to allow more detailed \n\ngeomorphological and bottom sedimentary descriptions of these systems, making the canyons \n\nmore accessible to safely obtain sediments samples, CTD profiles and to deploy moored \n\ninstruments. \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact on regional oceanography  \n\nSubmarine canyons are areas of increased exchange between oceanic and coastal water \n\nmasses, exhibiting intensified flow and turbulence in comparison to the adjacent shelf and slope, \n\npotentially affecting coccolithophore communities in their vicinity. Both observations and \n\nnumerical models demonstrate that canyons modify regional current patterns, changing \n\nmagnitude and direction of currents. Pressure-driven, wind-driven and tidal flows dominate \n\nwater motion within canyons (Hickey, 1995; Klinck, 1996; Allen and Durrieu de Madron, \n\n2009).  \n\nWhereas shelf and slope currents usually follow the isobaths due to geostrophic \n\nconstraints, once they are intersected by canyons, a new dynamic balance that is not geostrophic \n\nis produced; the along-flow will be focused by the canyon topography until it crosses the \n\nisobaths, resulting in enhanced cross-slope and cross-shelf exchange along the canyons. This \n\ncross-isobath flow tends to enhance wind-driven upwelling and downwelling currents, and \n\ncascading flows of dense water into the ocean. In addition, vertical water movements associated \n\nto wind-driven currents and internal tidal activity will be locally enhanced in the canyons and \n\nadjacent areas, due to topographic funneling of water (Hickey, 1997; Allen and Durrieu de \n\nMadron, 2009).  \n\nNarrow canyons have a relatively strong effect on the oceanographic circulation, whereas \n\nwider canyons mainly distort the flow to occur along isobaths. Near the sea surface, the flow \n\npasses unhindered across the canyon, but closer to the canyon rim, the flow is redirected along \n\nthe canyon axis with the occurrence of upwelling or downwelling occurrin depending on the \n\ndirection of the winds (Klinck, 1996; Hickey, 1997; She and Klinck, 2000; Palanques et al., \n\n2005). The mean flow within a few hundred meters of the canyon floor is predominantly \n\ndirected up- or down-canyon, constituting a very important mechanism for resuspension and \n\ntransport of sediments from the shelf and slope to the deep-sea. Stratification of the water \n\ncolumn reduces the canyon\u2019s topographic effect on the coastal flow (Klinck, 1996; She and \n\nKlinck, 2000 and references therein). \n\nUnder upwelling-favorable wind conditions in Eastern Boundary Systems like the \n\nPortuguese continental margin, downwelling of shelf water occurs along the northern canyon \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 36 \n\nrim (upstream side) whereas upwelling occurs along the canyon axis and southern rim \n\n(downstream side) (Allen, 1996; Hickey, 1997, Klinck, 1996). Large volumes of water are \n\npumped out of a canyon during upwelling events, which may result in an onshore flow up to 50 \n\ntimes more than occurring over the adjacent shelf and slope (Allen, 1996). During strong wind \n\nevents, intensification of upwelling in canyons may result in vertical velocities of up to 80 \n\nm/day (Hickey, 1997), bringing nutrient-rich water from depths up to 300 m to the canyon rim \n\nand onto the adjacent shelf (She and Klinck, 2000). The up-canyon deflection of deeper offshore \n\ncurrents can induce a strong nutrient transport into the euphotic zone, in the continental shelf, \n\nstimulating primary production on the shelf and nearshore areas (in Skliris and Djenidi, 2006).  \n\nUnder downwelling-favorable wind events, the circulation generated within the canyon is \n\nlargely opposite to that forced by upwelling winds, creating strong flow toward the shelf and \n\ncoast resulting in downwelling (Klinck, 1996; She and Klinck, 2000). A 3-D numerical \n\nmodeling study performed for the Calvi Canyon (NW Corsican coast) showed that convergence \n\nunder downwelling-favorable winds is amplified along the canyon, such that the canyon is \n\nacting as a trap of shelf water (Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). \n\nIn addition to pressure-driven and wind-driven circulation, tidal flows that usually run \n\nparallel to the shelf-break topography will be intersected by the presence of a narrow submarine \n\ncanyon, resulting in regions of intensified and focused baroclinic tides and internal waves, \n\nleading to strong vertical mixing within and around the canyon (e.g. Hickey, 1995; Allen and \n\nDurrieu de Madron, 2009; De Stigter et al., 2007). This process may result in higher particulate \n\nand nutrient concentrations in the water column within the canyon (e.g. Bosley et al., 2004; \n\nRyan et al., 2005). Where canyons cut across the entire width of a continental shelf, the \n\ninteraction between tidal currents and the canyon rim may result in internal waves that \n\npropagate from the canyon across the adjacent shelf, increasing bottom turbulence and thereby \n\nfavouring bottom sediment resuspension and transport (Huthnance et al., 2002; Quaresma et al., \n\n2007). \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact on marine ecosystems  \n\nWhereas the majority of studies on submarine canyon ecology are focused on the benthic \n\nsystem, exhibiting enhanced productivity associated with the accumulation of labile organic \n\nmatter, a strong response from plankton in the vicinity of canyons has also been reported from \n\nboth in situ observations (e.g. Allen et al., 2001; Bosley et al., 2004; Palanques et al., 2005; \n\nRyan et al., 2005; 2010) and numerical models (Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). This is partially \n\nexplained by the enhancement of upwelling at and near the canyons, providing a nutrient source \n\nthat increases phytoplankton and zooplankton productivity (Hickey, 1995; Allen, 1996; Klinck, \n\n1996). Funneling and trapping of plankton (e.g. Macquart-Moulin and Patriti, 1996; Skliris and \n\nDjenidi, 2006)) and resuspension phenomena driven by increased bottom turbulence in canyons \n\n(e.g. Bosley et al., 2004; Ryan et al., 2005) are additional factors leading to enhanced \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 37 \n\nproductivity in these regions. Recirculation within canyons also favors a prolonged residence \n\ntime of nutrients and biota in these areas (Hickey, 1995; 1997; Allen et al., 2001). \n\nThere is strong evidence to suggest that submarine canyons have an important effect on \n\nthe entire marine food chain, from phytoplankton to marine mammals. Some examples are \n\ngiven below: \n\nA three-dimensional hydrodynamic model used to investigate plankton dynamics in the \n\nCalvi Canyon (NW Corsica) showed maximum concentrations of phytoplankton occurring over \n\nthe canyon and downstream of the canyon mouth, and trapping of phytoplankton biomass by the \n\ncyclonic circulation within the canyon (Skliris and Djenidi, 2006);  \n\nIn the vicinity of Astoria Canyon (west coast of North America), local primary \n\nproduction may have a dominant role on the canyon food web in comparison to other potential \n\nsources. Densities and biomasses of some micronekton species were higher in the canyon in \n\ncomparison to nearby areas, suggesting that the distribution of these organisms was affected by \n\ncurrents modified by the canyon topography (Bosley et al., 2004);  \n\nIn the Palam\u00f3s Canyon (NW Mediterranean) chlorophyll concentrations were found to be \n\nhigher in its upper section (from the canyon head to about 1200 m) in comparison to its lower \n\nsection (deeper than 1200 m), suggesting a direct biological input from the coastal productivity \n\ninto the canyon system. Extremely high concentrations of cysts of a variety of planktonic \n\norganisms, including dinoflagellates, tintinnids and calanoida, were found in sediment traps \n\nfrom the Foix Canyon and Palam\u00f3s Canyon, in comparison to much lower concentrations from \n\nthe slope adjacent to the canyon, suggesting preferential accumulation driven by the \n\nhydrodynamics prevailing in the canyons and neighboring areas (Della Tommasa et al., 2000; \n\nPalanques et al., 2005). Alvarez et al. (1996) reported high fish larval density on the rims of \n\nPalam\u00f3s canyon, much larger than in the shelf area, whereas Macquart-Moulin and Patriti \n\n(1996) found accumulations of migratory micronekton crustaceans over submarine canyons on \n\nthe NW Mediterranean. David and Di-M\u00e9glio (2012) reported that these canyons are \n\npreferential sites for gathering of marine mammals, apparently related to food availability; \n\nIn the Barkley Canyon (SW off Canada), superficial zooplankton species were found to \n\nbe carried across the canyon with little deflection from their normal cross-shelf position, \n\nwhereas the deeper species were observed to be displaced in shoreward direction by the currents \n\nflowing through the canyon (Allen et al., 2001); \n\nIn the Monterey Canyon, interaction between currents and bottom topography was \n\nreported to have a strong impact on the spatial distribution of phytoplankton. Internal tidal \n\npumping of nutrients and resting stages of phytoplankton (i.e. cysts) from the deep shelf and/or \n\ncanyon to the shallow euphotic zone resulted in local phytoplankton production at the surface. \n\nThe upsurge of a wedge-shaped tongue of cold, dense water from the canyon was also reported \n\nto occur in this canyon, flowing up onto the continental shelf. The intruding water mass was \n\nobserved to entrain a plume of nutrient-rich turbid water from the seafloor up to the surface, \n\nabove which high concentrations of phytoplankton were observed (Ryan et al., 2005; 2010). \n\nThe topographic complexity of canyons, the time-varying nature of currents, and the \n\ndifficulty in sampling dynamic biological populations in such dynamic environments, makes it \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 38 \n\ndifficult to fully understand the trophic relationships within canyons (Bosley et al., 2004). More \n\ndirect, interdisciplinary and temporal measurements are necessary to understand the nature of \n\nsuch interactions (Hickey, 1995; Jordi et al., 2008).   \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3. The study area  \n\nCentral Portuguese margin  \n\nIn comparison to the larger part of the European Margin, the central Portuguese margin \n\nhas a relatively narrow shelf (20\u201350 km wide and a gradient of&lt;1\u00b0), passing into a steep \n\nirregular slope (6\u20137\u00b0) below the shelf-break which is located at 160-200 m depth. The margin is \n\ndissected by a number of long submarine canyons, of which the Nazar\u00e9 and Set\u00fabal\u2013Lisbon \n\ncanyons are the most remarkable (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Mougenot, 1989; Alves et \n\nal., 2003). The complex morphology and geology of the margin results from a strong structural \n\nheritage from deep variscan structures, later affected by Mesozoic extensional tectonics related \n\nto the opening of the North Atlantic, and by Cenozoic compression resulting from the collision \n\nof the European and African plates. Since the Miocene, the northern margin has experienced \n\nmajor subsidence, which allowed the build-up of thick prograding sedimentary series, \n\nparticularly on the shelf and slope. The shelf is composed of thick Cenozoic carbonate and \n\ndetritic formations, filling structural basins formed during earlier rifting phases (e.g. Vanney \n\nand Mougenot, 1981; Rodrigues, 2004; Alves et al., 2003).  \n\nSurface sediments on the shelf are generally very coarse and sand-dominated, and include \n\nold littoral deposits formed during the Holocene transgression preserved at shallow water \n\ndepths. Finer-grained sediments generally increase with depth on the shelf, but also occur in \n\nmuddy deposits located off the estuaries, in structural depressions at the middle shelf and in the \n\ncanyons upper reaches. At present, terrigenous sediment supply to the margin is relatively \n\nlimited, especially since the major rivers Tejo, Douro and Minho have been extensively \n\ndammed over the past decades (Dias et al., 2002). Still, it is subjected to the discharge of the \n\nmore important Portuguese rivers, as well as to a seasonally highly energetic regime (waves and \n\ntides). Cliff and beach erosion, reworking of shelf deposits and biogenic production constitute \n\nadditional sources of sediment (Dias, 1987; Van Weering et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002; \n\n2007). Further down in the continental slope, sediments change from slightly coarser and \n\ncompositionally variable on the upper slope towards more uniform fine-grained and carbonate-\n\nricher hemipelagic muds on the deeper slope (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011). \n\nSurface water circulation along the Portuguese margin is directly dependent on two major \n\ncurrent systems that transport surface water masses from west to east across the Atlantic: the \n\nNorth Atlantic Current and the Azores Current south of Iberia (Saunders, 1982; Pollard and Pu, \n\n1985; Barton, 2001; Peliz et al., 2005), both smoothly feeding into the near-surface equatorward \n\nflow of the Portugal and Canary currents (Saunders, 1982; Barton, 2001). Underneath, the \n\nIberian Poleward Current (IPC) can be recognized traveling poleward, counter to the general \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 39 \n\ncirculation and closely bound to the continental slope. This current is mostly restricted to the \n\nsubsurface layers along most of the eastern subtropical gyre, but it surfaces whenever the Trade \n\nWinds weaken or turn northward (Barton, 2001) (see Figure 1.7). \n\nCirculation over the Portuguese shelf and upper slope displays a marked seasonal \n\nvariation: during summer, the Azores high pressure system migrates towards the central \n\nAtlantic, typically inducing Trade Winds to become northerly, inducing the upwelling of colder, \n\nless salty and nutrient enriched subsurface water to rise to the surface along the Portuguese \n\ncoast (e.g. Fi\u00faza, 1983; Haynes et al. 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., \n\n2011); during winter, the Iceland low pressure system intensifies and the dominant wind regime \n\nbecomes southerly along the western Portuguese margin, inducing the IPC to rise over the upper \n\nslope and shelf and resulting in downwelling conditions over the shelf (Fi\u00faza, 1983; Vitorino et \n\nal., 2002). Typical winter wave conditions are swells from NW and SW with significant wave \n\nheights of 3\u20134 m, often exceeding 5 m during stormy periods, whereas during summer, a low \n\nenergy wave regime occurs, reaching mean significant wave heights&lt;2 m (Vitorino et al., \n\n2002). River runoff is an important feature of the winter circulation over the western Portuguese \n\nmargin. Significant discharge particularly from the NW Portuguese rivers (Mondego, Douro, \n\nMinho, Lima, Vouga) results in the formation of low salinity water lenses in the coastal ocean \n\n(Peliz et al., 2005). \n\nThe upper 500 m of water column off Portugal is mostly constituted by the Eastern North \n\nAtlantic Central Water (ENACW), which is the main source of the nutrient-rich upwelled \n\nwaters on the Portuguese coast, and reveals two main components of different origin, \n\nconverging to this region (Fi\u00faza, 1984; McCave and Hall, 2002): a lighter, relatively warm and \n\nsalty subtropical branch (ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually loses its \n\ncharacteristics as it travels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline colder \n\nwater mass of subpolar origin (ENACWsp) slowly flowing southwards below the poleward \n\nsubtropical branch (Fi\u00faza et al., 1998). Underneath the ENACW a strong salinity gradient is \n\nnoticed down to the core of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) lying at ~800\u20131400 m \n\ndepths (see Figure 1.7). The deeper water masses below the MOW comprise the Northeast \n\nAtlantic Deep Water (NEADW) below 2000 m, and the Lower Deep Water (LDW) at levels &lt;\n\n4000 m (Van Aken 2000ab).  \n\n \n\n \n\nNazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyons \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons are the largest submarine canyons of the central \n\nPortuguese margin, extending from near the shore to abyssal depth (Figure 1.7), and acting as \n\npreferential dispersal pathways of particulate matter and attached pollutants from the coast to \n\nthe deep sea (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; Richter et al., 2009; Jesus et al., 2010; Martin et al., \n\n2011). Their morphology, sedimentary processes and impact on the biological communities \n\nhave been described in recent literature (e.g. Van Weering et al., 2002; De Stigter et al., 2007; \n\n2011; Oliveira et al., 2007; Arzola et al., 2008; Lastras et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 2007; 2010; \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 40 \n\nMartin et al., 2011; Masson et al., 2011; Koho et al., 2007; 2008; Tyler et al., 2009; Cunha et \n\nal., 2011; Mendes et al., 2011), following extensive research performed in the framework of \n\nseveral scientific projects, both Portuguese (i.e. SEPLAT, 1974-2005; DEEPCO, 2006-2009) \n\nand European (OMEX II, 1997-2000; EUROSTRATAFORM, 2002-2005; HERMES, 2005-\n\n2009; HERMIONE, 2009-2012). \n\nThe present morphology of the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons results from erosive \n\nprocesses occurring at least since the middle Miocene. Their location appears to be, at least in \n\npart, controlled by the geological structure of the Portuguese Margin. The NE-SW general \n\norientation of the canyons is roughly parallel to pre-existing faults of late-Variscan age, both \n\nonshore and offshore (see Vanney and Mougenot, 1990; Alves et al., 2003; Lastras et al., 2009). \n\nSuch faults represent areas of relative weakness on the slope, thus susceptible to be eroded by  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7 - Geographical location of the central Portuguese margin and the Nazar\u00e9, Cascais and Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal submarine canyons.

IAP and TAP refer to the Iberian and Tagus Abyssal Plains, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\ngravity flows, and leading to the progressive headward erosion of the canyons (Pratson and \n\nCoackley, 1996; Arzola, 2008).  \n\nThe presence of large sedimentary levees along the lower course of the Nazar\u00e9 and \n\nSet\u00fabal canyons indicates that the two canyons acted as conduits for large-scale sediment \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 41 \n\ntransport to the deep-sea, contributing turbiditic sediments to the Tagus and Iberia Abyssal \n\nPlains, at least since the Miocene. Sediment core analysis indicates that highest sedimentation \n\nrates in this area mostly occurred during sea-level low stands of glacial times (Arzola et al., \n\n2008). Turbidity currents were the dominant processes of sediment erosion, transport and \n\ndeposition in the two canyons during glacial times. Closely-spaced stacks of thin turbidite layers \n\nthat are commonly observed in late-glacial deposits from the lower canyon are thought to be \n\ngenerated by fluvial processes directly affecting the upper canyons. Larger-volume canyon-\n\nflushing events triggered by earthquakes were relatively less common during glacial periods. \n\nDuring the Holocene, little sediment appears to have reached the abyssal plain through \n\nthe canyons with their upper and middle sections acting as sediment morphological traps, as \n\nrevealed by exceptionally high sedimentation rates recorded in these regions (De Stigter et al., \n\n2007; 2011; Masson et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon- \n\nSet\u00fabal canyon still exhibit a certain degree of activity, mostly controlled by internal tidal \n\ndynamics and sediment gravity flows triggered by meteorological forcing (Oliveira et al., 2007; \n\nDe Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; Martin et al., 2011). The present-day activity appears different for \n\nthe two canyons, probably related to their different geographical setting and morphology.  \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon is one of the largest and deepest submarine canyons of the European \n\nMargin, cutting across the full width of the central Portuguese margin, with its head located at \n\n~50 m water depth and less than 1 km from the shore. Although it is presently not connected to \n\na major modern drainage system, it is recognized as a major sediment pathway among European \n\ncanyons, obtaining its sediment input by capture of particles transported by littoral drift (Duarte \n\net al., 2000) and along the shelf (Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007).  \n\nIn the upper and middle parts of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, sediments are continuously \n\nresuspended and transported by strong internal tidal currents, as reflected by high turbidity \n\nvalues in bottom waters (up to 300 m above the bottom), high horizontal and vertical sediment \n\nfluxes in the bottom water layer. The diminishing strength of tidal currents down-canyon results \n\nin focused sediment deposition in the middle canyon, as revealed by high sediment \n\naccumulation rates observed in sediment traps and sediment cores in that area (De Stigter et al., \n\n2007; Masson et al., 2011) (Figure 1.8). Transport of fine-grained sediments further down to the \n\nlower canyon occurs through the action of intermittent gravity-driven flows triggered by \n\nresuspension of shelf sediments by winter storms and enhanced input of sediments by the \n\nflooding of rivers north of the canyon and around the canyon head. The deep indentation of the \n\ncanyon into the coastline and high exposure to incoming westerly storms certainly contributes to \n\nenhanced sediment input (Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2011; \n\nMasson et al., 2011). Transport of coarser sand-sized material to the lower canyon only occurs \n\nin centennial or longer time scales, with the most recent turbidite layer found in this region \n\ninterpreted as representing a canyon-flushing event triggered by the 1755 AD Lisbon \n\nEarthquake (Figure 1.9) (De Stigter et al., 2007). Despite of the apparently less energetic \n\nenvironment in the lowermost part of the canyon at the present, coarse gravel exposed in the \n\ncanyon walls indicates a much more active dynamics in the past, with catastrophic processes \n\ncapable of transporting boulders up to 1 m across (Tyler et al., 2009). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 42 \n\nAlthough connected with two major river systems, i.e. Tagus and Sado rivers, the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon appears to be much less dynamic than Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, and presently inactive in \n\nterms of down-canyon mass sediment transport (De Stigter et al., 2011). Unlike the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon, gravity-driven sediment flows appear rare at present in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. In \n\naddition, an overall up-canyon flow was observed to produce a net transport of suspended \n\nsediment toward the canyon head rather than disperse sediment down-canyon. In the middle and \n\nlower parts of the canyon, the sediment is essentially hemipelagic, similar to the sediment found \n\non the adjacent continental slope (De Stigter et al., 2011). The location of the heads of the \n\nLisbon and Set\u00fabal canyon branches at somewhat deeper water a few km off the coast, and the \n\nrelatively sheltered position of the upper canyon behind prominent coastal capes, probably \n\ncontribute to its low present-day sedimentary activity. During sea-level low-stands, however, \n\nthe heads of the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal canyon branches were probably indenting the estuaries of \n\nthe Tagus and Sado rivers (Dias et al., 2000), thereby funneling large amounts of sediments to \n\nthe deep-sea through high-energy and erosive turbidity currents similar to those reported from \n\nthe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Arzola et al., 2008; Lastras et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8 - Suspended particle load above the \n\nseabed in the axis of Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Tyler et al., \n\n2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLittle is known yet about the influence of the central Portuguese canyons on the \n\nproductivity and distribution of phytoplankton assemblages. The focus of biological research in \n\nthese canyons has been directed at understanding the functioning of benthic ecosystems, related \n\nto the fact that the canyons are recognized as major temporary depocenters and conduits of \n\norganic-rich particles to the deep-sea (Garcia and Thomsen, 2008; Masson et al., 2010; Garcia \n\net al., 2010), and sites of high heterogeneity in terms of substrate and physical processes. The \n\nPortuguese canyons appear to have an important role in modifying abundance and diversity \n\npatterns that are normally observed in continental slope environments (Cunha et al., 2011). A \n\nlarge variety of faunal species was observed in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon by Tyler et al. (2009), \n\nsuggesting the canyon represents a biodiversity hotspot. However, lower abundance of \n\nmeiobenthos observed along the axis of the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon by Koho et al. (2007, 2008)  \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 43 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9 \u2013 Sediment core collected from the lower Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, at 4976 m depth, showing a 19 cm \n\nthick turbidite layer at its base, resulting from a canyon-flushing event triggered by the 1755 AD Lisbon \n\n(De Stigter et al., 2007). \n \n\n \n\nand Garcia et al. (2007) was interpreted to result from the prevailing strong bottom currents and \n\nunstable sedimentary conditions, whereas higher abundances on the sediment-draped terraces \n\nand further downslope on the flat-floored middle and lower canyon sections (3000\u20135000-m \n\nwater depth) suggest that benthic organisms actively profit from fresh organic matter that is \n\nepisodically flushed from the upper canyon and deposited there (Koho et al., 2007; Garcia et al., \n\n2007). High abundance coupled with low biodiversity was also observed in macrofauna from \n\nthe upper part of Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons in comparison to the adjacent slope \n\nregions (Cunha et al., 2011).  \n\nMendes et al. (2011) performed the first investigation on the distribution and composition \n\nof phytoplankton assemblages in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, during an upwelling event, on the basis of \n\nphytoplankton pigments. According to these authors coccolithophores appeared most common \n\noutside the upwelling areas, in stratified and nutrient-poor waters. Maximum values of 19\u2019 \n\nhexanoyloxyfucoxantine, a pigment that represents a proxy for coccolithophores, were noticed \n\nnorth of the canyon and the maximum concentrations of phytoplankton biomass (i.e. Chl-a  \n\nwere found in the inner shelf north of the canyon\u2019s head. The other two dominant \n\nphytoplanktonic groups \u2013 diatoms and dinoflagellates \u2013 were more abundant in nutrient-rich \n\nupwelled waters along the coast. Contrasting nutrient conditions north and south of the canyon \n\nwere interpreted as resulting from the interaction between the canyon topography and upwelling \n\ncurrents, in particular the intensification of upwelling in the canyon head and southern canyon \n\nrim and nearby shelf. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 44 \n\n1.4. Framework and Objectives of the Thesis \n\nThe central Portuguese Margin and the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons have been the \n\nsubject of studies carried out in the framework of several scientific projects over the past \n\ndecades. The SEPLAT\n1\n national program (1974-2005) was designed and developed by the \n\nPortuguese Hydrographic Institute with the purpose of identifying the nature and extension of \n\nthe sedimentary deposits offshore Portugal and to produce the cartographic map of the \n\nsuperficial sediments from the Portuguese Continental Shelf, at 1:150,000. Over 12600 \n\nsediment samples were collected in the course of around 30 hydrographical cruises, providing \n\nthe fundamental basis of several research studies and training in the course of the last decades \n\n(Bizarro, 2010). The OMEX-I\n1\n (1993-1996) (Wollast and Chou, 1996) and OMEX-II\n\n1\n (1997\u2013\n\n2000) (Van Weering and McCave, 2002) projects, investigated the exchange of particulate and \n\ndissolved matter, with special focus on the exchange of organic carbon across the continental \n\nmargin of, respectively, the northern Bay of Biscay and NW Iberia. Some work was dedicated \n\nto the Lisbon Canyon (Jouanneau et al., 1998) and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Van Weering et al., 2002). \n\nThe EUROSTRATAFORM project\n1\n (2002-2005) (Weaver et al., 2006) was more directly \n\nfocused on exploring the role of canyons as preferential conduits of sediment transport to the \n\ndeep ocean, using among others the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons as examples of \n\ncontrasting sedimentary systems (Weaver, 2006). The DEEPCO\n1\n national project (2006-2009) \n\naimed to investigate the geomorphological, geophysical, sedimentary features of the submarine \n\ncanyons dissecting the NW Portuguese continental shelf, notably the Porto, Aveiro and Nazar\u00e9 \n\ncanyons (Guerreiro et al., 2005-2006). More recently, the projects HERMES\n1\n (2005-2009) \n\n(Weaver and Gunn, 2009) and HERMIONE\n1\n (2009-2012) (Weaver et al., 2009) had a broader \n\nmultidisciplinary approach, covering geology, oceanography and biology. The main purpose of \n\nthese projects was the mapping and understanding of the marine ecosystems on the European \n\ncontinental slope, including man\u2019s influence on these ecosystems. A very significant amount of \n\noceanographical, geological and biological data was acquired from the two canyon systems \n\nduring these projects, much of which has been published in recent literature.  \n\nAs the Portuguese canyons were found to constitute major temporary traps of organic-\n\nrich sediment (see Van Weering et al., 2002; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011), most biological \n\nstudies were directed at the benthic ecosystems profiting of organic matter enrichment (e.g. \n\nKoho et al., 2007; 2008; Garcia et al., 2007; Amaro et al., 2009; Tyler et al., 2009; Cunha et al., \n\n2011). Little attention was given to the phytoplankton communities thriving in these regions. \n\nThe main purpose of this thesis consists in filling this gap, focusing on the coccolithophores.  \n\nThe central hypothesis of this thesis, supported by field observations and results from \n\n                                                            \n1\n SEPLAT \u2013 Carta dos Sedimentos Superficiais da Plataforma Continental Portuguesa;  \n\nDEEPCO \u2013 Deep Sedimentary Conduits of the West-Iberian Margin; \n\nOMEX \u2013 Ocean Margin Exchange;  \n\nEUROSTRATAFORM \u2013 European Strata Formation;  \n\nHERMES \u2013 Hotspot Ecosystem on the Margins of European Seas;  \n\nHERMIONE \u2013 Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man\u2019s Impact On European Seas. \n\n \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 45 \n\nnumerical models, is that enhanced coast-shelf-slope exchange within submarine canyons is \n\ncapable of affecting the dynamics of plankton ecosystems (see Hickey, 1995; Kampf, 2006; \n\nSkliris et al., 2002; Bosley et al., 2004; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006; Ryan et al., 2005; 2010). The \n\npresent dissertation aims to (a) investigate the effects of the central Portuguese canyons on the \n\necology of recent coccolithophores, along coast-ocean transects, along and outside the canyons, \n\n(b) explore the potential of coccoliths as tracers of oceanographic processes occurring at the \n\ncentral Portuguese margin, namely those related to the submarine canyons. In order to achieve \n\nthis, water column and surface sediment samples were analysed to study the coccolithophore \n\nliving communities (i.e. biocoenosis) and sub-fossil coccolith assemblages (i.e. \n\nthanatocoenosis), respectively. Data obtained from the water column and surface sediment are \n\ncompared and integrated within a multidisciplinary and multi-proxy approach. Particular focus \n\nis attributed to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon.  \n\n \n\nIn more specific terms, the present study aims to address: \n\n \n\n(1) the coccolithophore assemblages currently thriving in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon region, and the \n\necological preferences and spatial (lateral and vertical) distribution of individual taxa;  \n\n(2) the relationship between the ecology of coccolithophores and the environmental \n\n(meteorological and hydrographical) settings off central Portugal; \n\n(3) the potential role of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon topography on the distribution, productivity and \n\necology of living coccolithophores; \n\n(4) the (paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographical differences between the Nazar\u00e9 and the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons, and between the canyons and their adjacent shelf-slope regions; \n\n(5) the extraction of  the (paleo)ecological signal within the coccolith sediment assemblages, \n\nindependent from the intensified taphonomical effects in submarine canyons and coastal \n\nsettings; \n\n(6) the introduction of Compositional Data Analysis (i.e. the isometric log-ratio approach) as a \n\nnew procedure to validate and obtain consistent (paleo)ecological interpretations. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5. Outline of the Thesis \n\nThis study presents data on living coccolithophore concentrations (cells per litre) from \n\nsurface waters of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon region, collected during a late winter period, and coccolith \n\nspecies concentrations (nanno per gram of sediment) obtained from surface sediments collected \n\nover a wider area in the central Portuguese margin, including the Nazar\u00e9, Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and \n\nCascais canyons, and their adjacent shelf-slope areas off Cape Mondego, Estremadura spur and \n\noff Cape Sines. The complete list of samples, respective positions, depth and analysed proxies is \n\npresented in Appendix D. Results are integrated and discussed within a significant and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 46 \n\nmultidisciplinary data set concerning the ecological and hydrological late-winter characteristics \n\noff central Portugal, and topographic and sedimentological features of the seabed. \n\nIn Chapter 2, a general characterization of the late winter coccolithophore communities \n\nthriving in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon region is presented. Hydrographic and meteorological variability \n\nduring the winter-spring transition are taken into consideration while interpreting the ecological \n\npreferences of coccolithophores. The impact of short-term environmental changes on the \n\nproductivity and ecology of this group, and the rapid response of certain species to nutrient \n\ninput, are investigated and discussed.  \n\nIn Chapter 3, the impact of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon topography on the spatial distribution and \n\necological preferences of the late winter coccolithophore assemblage is investigated, whereas \n\nthe potential of certain species as tracers of oceanographic phenomena occurring in the canyon \n\nduring this time of the year is explored. Results presented here are part of the ongoing \n\ninvestigation by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute of the complex dynamics of the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon (biological, physical and sedimentary), in relation with the seasonal circulation pattern \n\nprevailing west of central Portugal.  \n\nChapter 4 deals with the coccoliths preserved in surface sediment samples from the \n\ncentral Portuguese margin. North-South and onshore-offshore trends in coccolith concentrations \n\nand species percentages were analysed in relationship with sediment characteristics (i.e. \n\nsediment bulk composition, particle size, accumulation rate) to investigate to what extent these \n\nassemblages reflect a primary ecological signal related to surface water oceanography, and to \n\nwhat extent they are modified by taphonomical processes including reworking by bottom water \n\ncurrents. A comparison is made between the ecological and sedimentary dynamics of Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon and the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, and between the canyons and adjacent shelf-slope \n\nareas. \n\nChapter 5 is of a more methodological nature; a review of the factors controlling the \n\nsedimentation of coccoliths in coastal settings is presented, and the Compositional Data \n\nAnalysis (CoDA) is introduced as a new statistical tool to study the coccolith assemblages, and \n\nto confirm the effect of submarine canyons on the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores. Results \n\nfrom using CoDA are compared to those obtained from classical analytical methods, (i.e. \n\ncoccolith concentrations - nanno/g; coccolith fluxes - nanno/cm\n2\n/yr; and percentages), and \n\nfurther discussed.  \n\nChapter 6 synthesises the results presented in the previous chapters, with the aim of \n\nconceiving a general conceptual model for the role of the canyons in the (paleo)ecology and \n\ntaphonomy of coccolithophores. It includes a qualitative comparison between the living \n\ncommunities and the recent coccolith assemblages preserved on the seafloor. The potential of \n\ncoccoliths as (paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographic proxies in coastal settings and tracers \n\nof oceanographic processes prevailing within and around submarine canyons is discussed. \n\nFinally, proposals for future research are presented. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 47 \n\n1.6. Material and Methods \n\n A total of 219 samples were analysed for the study of coccolithophores and coccoliths \n\n(see Appendix D). A detailed description of the sampling, laboratory work and microscope \n\nanalysis used in this study - including the analysis of nutrients, Chl-a concentrations and \n\nacquisition of satellite imagery, which were performed by other researchers -  is included in \n\neach chapter of the thesis, and hence only a brief overview is presented below.  \n\n \n\n \n\nSampling  \n\n127 Water samples were collected at discrete depth levels (between 5 and 110 m depth) \n\nfrom 39 CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) casts around the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon region. \n\nSampling was conducted between 9 and 19 of March 2010, on board of NRP \u201cAlmirante Gago \n\nCoutinho\u201d during the 2\nnd\n\n HERMIONE scientific cruise. CTD profiling and water column \n\nsamples were collected using a combined Neil Brown MKIIIC CTD profiler equipped with an \n\nAquatracka nephelometer, a Seapoint fluorometer and a rosette sampler (12 Niskin bottles of 8 \n\nl) (Figure 1.10). Additional samples were collected to analyse nutrients and chlorophyll-a. \n\n92 Surface sediment samples were taken from the top 0.5 or 1 cm of box- and multicores, \n\ncollected along six transects crossing the central Portuguese margin in an approximately E-W \n\ndirection, along the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons and along adjacent shelf and slope \n\nareas. Sediment coring was performed during several cruises with RV Pelagia of Royal NIOZ \n\nbetween 2002 and 2011, in the framework of the European projects EUROSTRATAFORM and \n\nHERMES, and the Dutch scientific projects \u2018\u2018Lead in Canyons\u2019\u2019 and \u201cPacemaker\u201d (Figure \n\n1.10).  \n\n \n\n \n\nLaboratory and Microscope Analysis \n\nFor the study of coccolithophores, seawater samples of around 2 l were filtered over \n\ncellulose acetate filters (47 mm diameter and 0.45 ?m pore size) using a low pressure vacuum \n\nsystem. Coccospheres (cells) were identified and counted from a randomly chosen section of \n\neach filter, cut and permanently mounted on a glass slidewith a synthetical resin (Entellan), \n\nusing polarized light microscope (PLM) (Olympus BX-40) at 1250\u00d7 magnification. The number \n\nof cells per liter (cells/l) was estimated according to Cros (2001). To refine the taxonomic \n\ndifferentiation of certain groups, 18 samples were investigated using Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscope (SEM Hitachi S-3500N, at 5 kV). \n\nFor the study of sediment coccolith assemblages, a minimum of 300 individual coccoliths \n\nwere counted and identified from slides previously prepared according to the random settling \n\nprocedure (Flores and Sierro, 1997), using PLM. To minimize possible bias by differential \n\ndissolution, only coccolithophore species producing relatively large and more robust coccoliths \n\n(? 3 \u00b5m) were considered for the (paleo)ecological analysis.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n 48 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.10 \u2013 Aspects of the CTD profiler and rosette sampler containing the Niskin bottles (a-b); \n\nseawater collection (c) and filtering on the laboratory onboard, using a low pressure vacuum system (d); \n\nmulticorer equipment and collected sediment multicores (e-h); aspect of the uppermost sediment fluff \n\nlayer in perfect preservation, representing the water-sediment interface (i).  \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n 49 \n\nTaxonomic identification of coccolithophores from both seawater and sediment samples \n\nwas performed according to Jordan et al. (2004). \n\nAs most of the sedimentological data presented in this thesis have been previously \n\npresented and discussed by De Stigter et al. (2007, 2011), Jesus et al. (2010) and Costa et al. \n\n(2011), the reader is referred to these authors for a complete description of the analytical \n\nmethodology used to determine the sediment bulk composition, particle size and sediment \n\naccumulation rates. \n\n \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nStatistical multivariate analysis (r-mode Factor Analysis, by Statistica 10) and Spearman \n\ncorrelation were used to investigate the relationship between coccolithophore taxa and the \n\nenvironmental conditions. The analyses were performed upon data matrices with \n\ncoccolithophore data and the associated environmental proxies as columns (variables) Chapters \n\n2, 3 and 4).  \n\nThe isometric log-ratio (ilr) approach of Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) (Egozcue \n\net al., 2003) was used to test and validate the results obtained from the coccolith percentages \n\n(Chapter 5). Six compositional balances were determined by applying a sequential binary \n\npartition to seven taxonomic groups, based on our pre-knowledge of their ecological preferences \n\nfrom the scientific literature (e.g. Winter et al., 1994; Cach\u00e3o and Moita, 2000; Cach\u00e3o et al., \n\n2000; Silva et al., 2008), and from the species percentages (Chapters 4 and 5). A balance-\n\ndendrogram representing the six isometric log-ratios was automatically obtained using \n\nCODAPACK software (Version 2.01.13). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom  \n\noff central Portugal in response to  \n\nriver discharge and upwelling \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nChapter 2  \n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom off \n\ncentral Portugal in response to river \n\ndischarge and upwelling  \n \n\n \n\nPublished as C.

Late winter coccolithophore bloom off central Portugal in response to \n\nriver discharge and upwelling. Continental Shelf Research 59, 65-83 \n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nCoccolithophore communities collected during late winter (9\u201319 March of 2010) over the \n\ncentral Portuguese margin showed a major change in species abundance and composition within \n\na few days\u2019 time, closely related to the highly transient meteorological and oceanographic \n\nconditions.  \n\nParticularly favourable conditions for coccolithophore growth resulted from late winter \n\ncontinental runoff combined with northerly winds prevailing over the shelf, under clear sky \n\nconditions. A nutrient-rich Buoyant Plume (BP) resulting from intense river water runoff prior \n\nto and during the start of the cruise, was observed to spread out over the denser winter mixed \n\nlayer water beneath, and extend equatorwards and offshore under influence of Ekman \n\nsuperficial dynamics. Stabilization of buoyancy, settling of suspended sediment from the BP \n\nand the prevailing clear sky conditions in the transition to the 2\nnd\n\n leg of the cruise resulted in \n\noptimum conditions for coccolithophores to develop, at the expense of nutrient availability in \n\nthe superficial sunlit layer. Within a few days, coccolithophore cell densities and associated \n\nphytoplankton biomass more than tripled, reaching maximum values of 145,000 cells/l and ~13 \n\nmg/l Chl-a, respectively.  \n\nOften considered as a uniform functional group of calcifying phytoplankton thriving in \n\nlow-turbulence, low-nutrients and high-light environments, results presented in this study \n\nclearly show that coccolithophore life strategies are much more diverse than expected. The \n\nincrease of cell densities was mainly due to the bloom of Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa \n\noceanica in the coastal region west off Cape Carvoeiro, together with other opportunistic \n\nphytoplankton genera (Chaetoceros s.l., Thalassiosira s.l and Skeletonema s.l.). This confirms \n\ntheir role as early succession r-selected taxa, capable of rapid growth within nutrient-rich \n\nenvironments. On the contrary, Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. displayed the \n\ncharacteristics of K-selected species, being consistently more abundant in more oceanic and less \n\neutrophic waters, away from the influence of the BP, during both low- and high-productive \n\nperiods.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n54 \n\nA general description of coccolithophore communities as well as the environmental \n\nconditions during this period is presented in this study (i.e. hydrography and nutrient \n\navailability). Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the impact of short-term \n\nenvironmental changes on the productivity and ecology of this group. In view of the observed \n\ndominance of coccolithophores off Portugal during winter, this transitional period appears \n\nparticularly favourable for coccolithophores to develop. The results highlight the importance of \n\ntaking short-term hydrographic and meteorological variability into account when interpreting \n\nthe ecological preferences of coccolithophores from coastal-neritic-oceanic transitional settings. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Coccolithophore ecology; river runoff; Ekman circulation; haline-stratification; \n\nPortuguese margin  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nCoccolithophores are a major group of unicellular marine phytoplankton, representing the \n\nmain component of extant calcareous nannoplankton. Their ability to produce delicate calcite \n\nplatelets, the coccoliths, combined with their ocean-wide distribution, makes them the most \n\nproductive calcifying organisms on Earth, with remarkable potential as paleoenvironmental \n\nmarkers (e.g. Winter et al., 1994; Ziveri et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008). In addition to their \n\nunique role in the marine carbon cycle, forming part of both the biological and carbonate pumps \n\n(Rost and Riebesell, 2004), they are likely to produce additional feedback to climate due to their \n\nphysical (albedo increase resulting from the highly reflective masses of detached coccoliths) and \n\nbiochemical (production of dimethylsulphonium propionate - DMSP) characteristics \n\n(Westbroek et al., 1993; Malin and Steinke, 2004). \n\nThe general biogeography and habitat characteristics of coccolithophores are known from \n\nplankton and bottom sediment surveys (McIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967; Brand, 1994; Roth, 1994; \n\nWinter et al., 1994; Young, 1994; Ziveri et al., 2004). The group is usually associated with \n\noligotrophic conditions in warm and stratified waters from low and middle latitude regions (e.g. \n\nMcIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967; Winter et al., 1994; Ziveri et al., 2004). However, local phenomena \n\nsuch as coastal currents, gyres, eddies, upwelling, river runoff, are known to regionally affect \n\ntheir productivity (Cach\u00e3o and Moita, 2000; Ziveri et al., 2004). Studies of modern \n\ncoccolithophores suggest that their ecology is mostly controlled by light and nutrient \n\navailability rather than by temperature and water stratification alone. This is indicated by their \n\noccurrence in blooms (e.g. Knappertsbusch and Brummer, 1995; Souza et al., 2011) in the \n\ncontext of subtropical oligotrophic gyres or within turbulent coastal and mature upwelled waters \n\n(e.g. Ziveri et al., 1995; Baumann et al., 1999; 2000; Cach\u00e3o and Moita, 2000; Moita, 2001; \n\nMoita et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2008). More regional studies on living coccolithophores are \n\nrequired to calibrate their specific local ecological tolerances and to assess their potential for \n\nlocal paleoceanographic reconstructions (e.g. Andruleit et al., 2003). \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n55 \n\nThe central Portuguese margin (Figure 2.1) is part of the North Atlantic Upwelling \n\nRegion (see Relvas et al., 2007), and located on the boundary between the transitional and the \n\nsubtropical coccolithophore biogeographical zones (McIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967). In a number of \n\nimportant studies on the coccolithophore assemblages living off Portugal, the group generally \n\nappears to be dominant over diatoms during winter, when warmer and nutrient-depleted \n\nsubtropical waters flow onto the Portuguese shelf (Abrantes and Moita, 1999; Cach\u00e3o and \n\nMoita, 2000; Cach\u00e3o et al., 2000; Cach\u00e3o and Oliveira, 2000; Silva et al., 2008, 2009; Moita et \n\nal., 2010). The entrainment of subtropical water masses, originating from south of the Azores \n\nFront into the Iberian Poleward Current during winter, is reflected in coccolithophore \n\nassemblages by the occurrence of subtropical species like Algirosphaera quadricornu, \n\nAlveosphaera bimurata, Cyclolithus annulus, Florisphaera profunda, Michaelsarsia elegans, \n\nSyracosphaeara lamina and Turrilithus latericioides, along with temperate species like \n\nGephyrocapsa muellerae, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Emiliania huxleyi (Cach\u00e3o et al., 2000). \n\nMore recently, during a four years weekly survey, Silva et al. (2008) performed the first \n\nsystematic investigation of the coccolithophore assemblages from offshore Portugal. This study \n\nconfirmed the preference of the group for non-upwelling conditions, although certain species \n\nappeared capable of withstanding coastal turbulence and well-adapted to the nutrient-rich \n\ncoastal environment (i.e. E. huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa oceanica). Later, Moita et al. (2010) \n\nidentified the assemblage composed by Helicosphaera carteri, Syracosphaera pulchra and \n\nCoronosphaera mediterranea as a summer tracer of subtropical waters upwelled along the \n\nsouthwestern and southern coast of Portugal. \n\nHere we report on coccolithophore assemblages collected during a two-leg hydrographic \n\nand plankton survey west off Portugal, during a late winter period (9\u201319 March 2010) at the end \n\nof an exceptionally negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. A detailed characterization \n\nof the living assemblages is presented, as well as a general description of the meteorological and \n\noceanographic conditions during the cruise (i.e. wind, hydrography, chlorophyll-a and nutrient \n\navailability). Our aim is to investigate the impact of the transient environmental settings on the \n\necology and productivity of this group in the central Portuguese margin. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Regional setting \n\nThe central Portuguese margin has a relatively narrow shelf (20\u201350 km wide and a \n\ngradient&lt;1\u00ba), which at 100\u2013200 m depth passes into a steep irregular slope (6\u00ba\u20137\u00ba). The shelf is \n\ncomposed of thick (>1000 m) Cenozoic sediments covering a Mesozoic substrate (Jouanneau et \n\nal., 1998) and dissected by a number of long submarine canyons, namely the Nazar\u00e9, Cascais \n\nand Set\u00fabal\u2013Lisbon canyons (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Alves et al., 2003; Lastras et \n\nal., 2009).  \n\nSurface water circulation along the Portuguese margin is directly dependent on two major \n\ncurrent systems that transport surface water masses from west to east across the Atlantic: the \n\nNorth Atlantic Current extending to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, and the Azores Current \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n56 \n\nsouth of Iberia (Saunders, 1982; Pollard and Pu, 1985; Barton, 2001; Peliz et al., 2005). As the \n\nAzores Current flows eastwards, branches of this current smoothly loop northward into the \n\nPortugal Current and southward into the Canary Current (Saunders, 1982; Barton, 2001) (Figure \n\n2.1a).  \n\nThe upper 500 m of water column off Portugal, including the surface mixed layer and the \n\nfirst thermocline, are constituted by Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) which is \n\nthe main source of the nutrient-rich upwelled waters along the Portuguese coast. The ENACW \n\nhas two main components of different origin, converging to this region: a lighter, relatively \n\nwarm and salty subtropical branch (ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually \n\nloses its characteristics as it travels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline \n\ncolder water mass of subpolar origin (ENACWsp), related to the Subpolar Mode Water formed \n\nin the eastern North Atlantic by winter cooling and deep convection (Fi\u00faza et al., 1998), slowly \n\nflowing southwards below the poleward subtropical branch (Figure 2.1a).  \n\nBeneath the near-surface equatorward flow of the Portugal and Canary currents, the \n\nIberian Poleward Current (IPC) can be recognized travelling poleward, counter to the general \n\ncirculation and closely bound to the continental slope, its core extending about 300\u2013400 m \n\nvertically (Figure 1a). This current is mostly restricted to the subsurface layers along most of the \n\neastern subtropical gyre, but it surfaces whenever the Trade Winds weaken or turn northward \n\n(Barton, 2001).  \n\nCirculation over the Portuguese shelf and upper slope displays a marked seasonal \n\nvariation associated with seasonal shifts in the position of the Azores high and Iceland low \n\npressure systems (e.g. Haynes et al., 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007). During summer, \n\nthe Azores high migrates towards the central Atlantic, typically inducing Trade Winds to \n\nbecome northerly, inducing an equatorward circulation over the upper 150\u2013200 m of the water \n\ncolumn off Portugal. A surface layer of about 30 m thick of relatively warmer and lighter water \n\nis swept offshore by Ekman transport, allowing colder, less salty and nutrient enriched \n\nsubsurface water to rise to the surface along the coast (e.g. Fi\u00faza, 1983; Haynes et al., 1993; \n\nBarton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2011). During winter, when the Azores high is \n\nlocated further south and the Iceland low intensifies, the dominant wind regime becomes \n\nsoutherly along the western Portuguese margin. This induces the IPC to rise over the upper \n\nslope and shelf, where the poleward flow produces an onshore Ekman transport, in turn \n\nresulting in downwelling conditions over the shelf (Fi\u00faza, 1983; Vitorino et al., 2002). \n\nDischarge of fresh water from rivers and streams, leading to the formation of coastal low \n\nsalinity water lenses, is another important feature of the winter circulation over the western \n\nPortuguese margin. The Buoyant Plumes (BP\u2019s) that are thus formed either develop into inshore \n\ncurrents (Relvas et al., 2007; Otero et al., 2008) or spread further offshore, depending on the \n\nwind forcing conditions over the shelf (Otero et al., 2008). Under typical winter conditions, the \n\nonshore Ekman transport driven by prevailing southerly winds induces the saline front to move \n\ntoward the coast, thus forcing the BP to develop into a narrow coastal current with strong \n\npoleward velocities (e.g. Marta-Almeida et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002; Relvas et al., 2007). \n\nWhen the southerly winds weaken or turn northerly, offshore spreading of the plume occurs,  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 (a) Schematic map of the central Portuguese margin, showing topographic features and surface and deep currents mentioned in the text. Rectangle indicates the \n\nsampling area. Arrows represent the main currents: river runoff (thick brown) and offshore and equatorward expansion of the buoyant river plume (curved brown dashed \n\nlines), summer equatorward shelf current (continuous blue), IPC (continuous black), Portugal Current (thick light grey), ENACWsp and ENACWst (short dashed), and MOW \n\n(long dashed); (b) Enlargement of the sampling area.

Squares with a black contour refer to stations where samples were collected for nutrient analysis. Stations with number \n\nlabel indicate the locations where coccolithophore sampling was performed. Red and blue lines represent the location of the density profiles along the upper-middle Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon axis and west of Cape Carvoeiro, during the 1\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n legs of the cruise, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.3. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n58 \n\neven when wind variation is of short (1\u20133 h) duration (Otero et al., 2008) (Figure 1a). The \n\nWestern Iberian Buoyant Plume is mostly fed by outflow from the northern Portuguese rivers \n\n(Mondego, Douro, Minho, Lima, Vouga), and is characterized by low salinities (<35.8) and \n\nlower temperature than the ambient shelf waters (Peliz et al., 2005).  \n\nThe seasonally variable circulation on the Portuguese shelf and slope is also subject to \n\ninterannual variation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the latter resulting \n\nfrom fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure between the Azores high and the \n\nIceland low. Under NAO high index conditions, Trade Winds increase and bring moist air to \n\nEurope, leading to cool summers and mild and wet winters in central Europe and its Atlantic \n\nfacade. On the contrary, NAO low index conditions are characterized by atmospheric \n\ntemperature extremes with heat-waves and cold spells, and an increase of storm activity and \n\nrainfall in southern Europe and North Africa. Several studies indicate that in more recent years \n\nupwelling events off Portugal have decreased in intensity but increased in frequency, occurring \n\neven during the winter period (e.g. Barton, 2001; Vitorino et al., 2002; Santos et al., 2004; \n\nRibeiro et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2008; Alvarez et al., 2009), apparently linked with the trend \n\ntoward the \u201chigh index\u201d polarity of the NAO observed over the last decades, (Barton, 2001; \n\nWallace, 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3. Material and methods \n\n2.3.1. Sample collection \n\nSampling was conducted between 9 and 19 of March 2010, on board of NRP \u201cAlmirante \n\nGago Coutinho\u201d during the 2\nnd\n\n HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man\u2019s Impact \n\non European Seas) scientific cruise. Coccolithophore communities were investigated in 127 \n\nwater column samples collected and analyzed from 39 CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) \n\ncasts from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon region (Figure 2.1b, Appendix D). Samples were collected at \n\ndiscrete water depth levels between 5 and 110 m depth to assess the distribution of \n\ncoccolithophores along the shelf and oceanic water column in relation with hydrographic and \n\nbiological characteristics.  \n\nDuring the 1\nst\n leg (9\u201312 March) CTD profiling and water sampling was conducted along \n\na transect in the upper and middle part of Nazar\u00e9 Canyon following the canyon axis, as well as \n\nalong transects across the upper canyon and surrounding shelf. During the 2\nnd\n\n leg (15\u201319 \n\nMarch) profiling and sampling was conducted along a transect crossing the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon near \n\nthe upper-middle canyon transition (stations 174, 176 and 258), and two transects across the \n\nadjacent shelf and slope, one along the northern valley, a minor incision of the shelf break north \n\nof Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (stations 146, 142 and 251), and the other west off Cape Carvoeiro, south of \n\nthe canyon. \n\nPhysical oceanographic, biological and chemical data (i.e. temperature, salinity, turbidity, \n\nfluorometry and nutrients) and water column samples were collected using a combined Neil \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n59 \n\nBrown MKIIIC CTD profiler equipped with an Aquatracka nephelometer, a Seapoint \n\nfluorometer and a rosette sampler (12 Niskin bottles of 8 l). Around 192 samples of suspended \n\nmatter were collected from surface, intermediate and bottom nepheloid layers in order to define \n\nthe particulate matter concentration and to calibrate the nephelometer response (turbidity). \n\nCalibration of turbidity was carried out following the manufacturer's recommendations. The \n\nused nephelometer has a pulsed Xenon flash light source with high ultra violet content (440 \n\nnm), and measures light scattered back from suspended particles using a solar-blind photodiode \n\ndetector. It has a very high sensitivity to low values of turbidity, and to small particles (<4 mm), \n\nwith a precision of 4 % of the measured value. Measurements are not affected by Chl-a (680 \n\nnm). The particulate matter concentration (PCM, g/m\n3\n) was compared to a laboratory calibration \n\nof the instrument with a standard formazine solution (FTU). The turbidity calibration for March \n\n2010 was FTU=0.112\u00d7PMC with r=0.88. CTD data are represented as contour plots constructed \n\nwith the inverse distance to power gridding method of Surfer Version 8. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Meteorological and hydrographic data \n\nWind data were collected with an Aanderaa AWS 2700 coastal weather station located at \n\nFerrel and maintained by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute (IH) (position: 39\u00ba 23.3\u2019N; 09\u00ba \n\n17.5\u2019W, WGS84). Sea wave conditions were obtained from the MONICAN multiparametric \n\nbuoy (IH) located offshore in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis (position: 39\u00ba 28\u2019N; ?9\u00ba 40\u2019W) \n\n(http://monican.hidrografico.pt/). Average daily river discharge data (m\n3\n/s) of the Douro River, \n\nmeasured at the hydrometric station at Crestuma (EDP) (position: 41\u00ba 04\u2019N; 8\u00ba29\u2019W) were \n\nobtained from the Sistema Nacional de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o de Recursos H\u00eddricos, SNIRH, from \n\nInstituto da \u00c1gua (http://snirh.pt). Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and monthly \n\naveraged chlorophyll-a data (Chl-a) for the area and time interval involved in this study were \n\ndownloaded from the Ocean Colour Website (http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov). These data \n\nwere acquired by the Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA\u2019s \n\nAqua satellite and processed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Daily images \n\ncovering the region of interest were averaged for PAR. Cloud coverage was also estimated from \n\nMODIS data, as the percentage of pixels in the image flagged with \u201cprobable cloud or ice \n\ncontamination\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Laboratory and microscope analysis \n\n2.3.3.1. Phytoplankton pigments and nutrients \n\nChlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations were used as an indicator for phytoplankton \n\nbiomass. Water samples of 2 l were filtered over Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 ?m pore size, 25 \n\nmm diameter), and the filters were immediately deep-frozen and stored at ?80 \u00baC. \n\nPhytoplankton pigments were extracted with 2\u20133 ml of 95 % cold buffered methanol (2 % \n\nhttp://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n60 \n\nammonium acetate) and analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). \n\nChromatographic separation was carried out following Zapata et al. (2000). Chl-a \n\nconcentrations obtained from 38 HPLC samples were then used to calibrate fluorometry \n\nmeasurements obtained from CTD casts (r\n2\n=0.7 and r\n\n2\n=0.6, with p&lt;0.01, for the 1\n\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n leg, \n\nrespectively). Further details on the HPLC method used can be found in Mendes et al. (2007). \n\nWater samples for nutrient analysis were filtered on board ship by vacuum with \n\npolycarbonate filters of 0.45 mm pore size and kept frozen below ?20 \u00baC until analysis. Nutrient \n\nconcentrations (NOx: nitrate/nitrite, ammonium, PO4: phosphate, and SiO2: dissolved silica) \n\nwere determined using a Skalar SAN plus Segmented Flow Auto Analyzer specially designed \n\nfor the analysis of saline waters. N\u2013NOx and N\u2013NO2 were determined according to Strickland \n\nand Parsons (1972), with N\u2013NO3 being estimated by the difference between the previous two; \n\nN\u2013NH4 and Si\u2013SiO2 were determined according to Koroleff (1976); P\u2013PO4 was determined \n\naccording to Murphy and Riley (1962). All methods were adapted to the methodology of \n\nsegmented flow analysis and uncertainties were determined following Mendes et al. (2011). \n\nLimits of quantification and detection (=1/3 LQ) were, respectively, the following: 0.50 and \n\n0.17 for nitrate+nitrite, 0.1 and 0.033 for nitrite, 1.0 and 0.33 for ammonia, 0.2 and 0.067 for \n\nphosphate, and 0.3 and 0.1 for silica. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.3.2. Coccolithophores \n\nFor the study of coccolithophores, seawater samples of around 2 l were filtered over \n\ncellulose acetate filters (0.45 ?m pore size, 47 mm diameter) using a low pressure vacuum \n\nsystem. The filters were then rinsed with tap water to remove salt and oven-dried at 40 \u00baC for 24 \n\nh. A randomly chosen section (approx. 30\u00ba\u201345\u00ba) of each filter (radius of ~24 mm) was cut and \n\npermanently mounted on a glass slide. Coccospheres (cells) were identified and counted under \n\npolarized light microscope (PLM) (Olympus BX-40) at 1250\u00d7 magnification. The examined \n\narea per filter varied between 3.0\u00d710\n5 \n\nand 3.4\u00d710\n6\n mm\n\n2\n, depending on the general cell density. \n\nThe number of cells per liter (cells/l) was estimated from the number of counted coccospheres \n\nin the examined area multiplied with the ratio of total filter area to examined area and divided \n\nby the volume of filtered water (Cros, 2001).  \n\nTaxonomy of coccolithophores was performed according to Jordan et al. (2004). To \n\nrefine the taxonomic differentiation of Syracosphaera spp., Gephyrocapsa spp., Algirosphaera \n\nrobusta and Ophiaster spp., 18 samples were investigated using the Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscope (SEM Hitachi S-3500N, at 5 kV). Samples were selected for containing relatively \n\nhigher cell densities and species diversity. A randomly chosen section of the selected filters was \n\nfixed with colloidal Ag on a SEM stub and sputtered with an Au\u2013Pd coating of maximum 20 \n\nnm thick. A minimum of 100 vision fields (VF) were then examined and coccospheres counted \n\nusing magnifications between 1000\u00d7 (observation area of each VF: 1.2\u00d710\n4\n ?m\n\n2\n) and 2000\u00d7 \n\n(observation area of each VF: 3.0\u00d710\n4\n \u00b5m). \n\n \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n61 \n\n2.3.4. Statistical analysis \n\nIn order to investigate the relationship between coccolithophore taxa and environmental \n\nconditions during the cruise, a statistical multivariate analysis (r-mode Factor Analysis, by \n\nStatistica 10) was performed upon data matrices with coccolithophore cell densities, nutrient \n\nconcentrations (NOx, PO4 and SiO2), Chl-a and physical parameters (temperature, salinity and \n\nturbidity) as columns (variables). In view of the very different conditions encountered during \n\nthe 1\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n leg (see Section 2.4.1) the two legs of the cruise were analyzed separately from \n\ntwo distinct data matrices. Only the more abundant coccolithophore species were considered \n\n(>2000 cells/l). Results from the original data matrices were optimized through Varimax Raw \n\nrotation. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4. Results \n\n2.4.1. Environmental conditions during the cruise \n\nHydrographic profiling and plankton sampling took place at the end of what for \n\nsouthwest European standards was an unusually cold winter (2009\u20132010), associated with an \n\nexceptionally negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Cattiaux et al., 2010; \n\nTroupin and Machin, 2012), as indicated by data from the NOAA-AVHRR data centre \n\n(http://www.knmi.nl/datacentrum/satellite_earth_observations/NOAA/2010). Whereas the \n\nwinter mixed layer still comprised the upper 150\u2013200 m of the water column over the shelf and \n\nupper slope, the period of sample collection was marked by transient meteorological and \n\nhydrographic conditions. During the 1\nst\n leg of the cruise, the general circulation on the shelf was \n\nunder the influence of intense river runoff, and intensified onshore oceanic convergence induced \n\nby the southerly wind regime prevailing prior to the cruise (Figure 2.2). Hydrometric stations \n\nalong the Douro River measured a peak discharge two weeks prior to the cruise. \n\nA shift to northerly winds occurred on the 9\nth\n\n of March 2010, coinciding with the start of \n\nthe cruise. Initially alternating in northerly and southeasterly direction during most of the 1\nst\n leg, \n\nthe wind increased in strength (max. ~15 m/s) and became persistently northerly in the interval \n\nbetween the two legs, turning back to southerlies on the 15\nth\n of March at the start of the 2\n\nnd\n leg \n\n(Figure 2.2). Sea wave conditions were mostly moderate, dominated by significant wave heights \n\n(Hs) between 1.4 and 2.3 m, mainly coming from W to NW. Ocean colour satellite images \n\nindicate a cloud coverage >50 % during most of the cruise except at the end of the 1\nst\n leg and \n\nthe two following days when skies were generally clear. The clear skies resulted in a relative \n\nincrease of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) in this short period (Figure 2.2). \n\nDuring both legs of the cruise a well-established surface layer of less dense water was \n\nobserved, with markedly lower temperature and salinity than that of the underlying winter \n\nmixed layer. The layer, interpreted as a buoyant plume (BP) resulting from the recent high river \n\ndischarge, extended from near the coast to more than 50 km offshore (see water density profiles \n\nin Figure 2.3a,b). During the 1\nst\n leg, while there was still important river discharge to the shelf,  \n\nhttp://www.knmi.nl/datacentrum/satellite_earth_observations/NOAA/2010\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Time series of relevant meteorological parameters and Douro River discharge measured in \n\nMarch 2010.

Wind intensity (m/s) and direction from the coastal meteorological station at Ferrel. \n\nNortherly winds dominated from 9 to 15 of March, later changing to southerlies from 16 to 19 of March \n\nof 2010. Grey shaded areas mark the periods of the two legs of the cruise. \n\n \n\nT and S values in the BP were conspicuously low (min. 14.2 \u00baC and 33.8, respectively), slightly \n\nincreasing during the 2\nnd\n\n leg (min. 14.4 \u00baC and 34.8, respectively), following three days of \n\npersistent northerly wind.  \n\nSignificant variability in thickness of the BP and in the steepness of the TS gradient at its \n\nbase was noticed during both legs of the cruise. During the 1\nst\n leg, closer to the coast, the BP \n\nwas 40\u201350 m thick and gradually increasing in TS from the surface down to the winter mixed \n\nlayer below, suggesting significant vertical mixing between the two water masses; further \n\noffshore, the BP decreased to 15\u201320 m thick with a relatively steep TS gradient at its base. \n\nDuring the 2\nnd\n\n leg, the BP appeared to have increased in thickness relative to what was observed \n\nduring the 1\nst\n leg, with the TS gradient at its lower boundary extending in some cases to more \n\nthan 100 m depth, closer to the shelf-break. The BP decreased in thickness and at the same time \n\nbecame more sharply defined in offshore direction, with the thinnest BP occurring at the more \n\ndistal stations off Cape Carvoeiro.  \n\nThe warmer and saltier winter mixed layer underneath the BP was present in the entire \n\ninvestigated region, at depths generally between 15 and 20 m, and 200 m. Higher TS values \n\nclose to the shelf-break, at the upper-middle Nazar\u00e9 Canyon transition, and further offshore \n\nalong the southern flank of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, trace out the core of the IPC along the upper \n\nslope. Further north along the slope around 39.5 \u00baN, lower TS values indicate mixing of the IPC \n\nwith colder water masses from north.  \n\n \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Representative density sections based on CTD casts along two coast-to-ocean transects: (a) \n\nWSW \u2013 ENE transect along the axis of the upper to middle part of Nazar\u00e9 Canyon covered during the 1\nst\n \n\nleg, and (b) W \u2013 E transect off Cape Carvoeiro covered during the 2\nnd\n\n leg. Location of the transects is \n\nindicated on Figure 2.1b. CTD station positions are indicated by tick marks along the top of the graph. \n\nNumber labels refer to CTD stations where coccolithophore samples were collected. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe boundary with the colder and less saline superficial layer was particularly well-\n\ndefined during the 1\nst\n leg, when the core of the IPC was centred less than 10 km off the coast. \n\nThe TS gradient marking the boundary between the BP and the winter mixed water layer \n\nappeared less acute in CTD profiles measured during the 2\nnd\n\n leg, suggesting mixing of the two \n\nwater masses had taken place. \n\nWhereas turbidity was generally low during the cruise, some near-shore stations \n\nmonitored during the 1\nst\n leg showed higher turbidity at the surface. Enhanced turbidity was \n\nclearly associated with the BP, as the highest FTU values corresponded to the lowest salinity. \n\nHigh turbidity values recorded around 200\u2013300 m water depth in the upper canyon, however, \n\nappear to reflect bottom sediment resuspension caused by the canyon's internal tide. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n64 \n\n2.4.2. Nutrients \n\nDuring the 1\nst\n leg, highest nutrient concentrations were recorded in the relatively cool and \n\nlow-saline surface water of the BP, decreasing to lower concentrations in the winter mixed \n\nwater layer below the surface (Figure 2.4). The decrease with depth was particularly noticeable \n\nin the case of SiO2. During the 2\nnd\n\n leg, nutrient concentrations in the superficial water layer \n\nappeared to have significantly decreased, becoming lower than in the underlying water mass. In \n\nthe deeper water layer nutrients had also decreased but much less than near the surface. The \n\nrapid depletion of nutrients from the superficial water layer, and slower decrease in nutrient \n\nconcentrations below the surface is likely reflecting higher rates of nutrient consumptions by \n\nphytoplankton at the surface during this time of the cruise. This is particularly apparent for NOx, \n\nbut to a lesser degree for PO4 and SiO2. Median+/- standard deviation of NOx/PO4 ratio in \n\nsuperficial water layer was 16.1+/- 2.1 and 3.8+/-3.8 during the 1\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n leg, respectively, \n\nclose to the 16:1 Redfield Ratio typical for marine waters (Redfield et al., 1963). Lower ratio's \n\noccurring in samples from the 2\nnd\n\n leg suggests that NOx was becoming the limiting nutrient for \n\nphytoplankton growth at that time. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.3. Phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and coccolithophore cell densities \n\nPhytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and coccolithophore cell densities (cells/l) drastically \n\nincreased from the 1\nst\n leg (max.&lt;1 mg/l and 4.2\u00d710\n\n4\n cells/l) to the 2\n\nnd\n leg (max. ~13 mg/l \n\nand15\u00d710\n4\n cells/l). Both were generally higher at the upper part of the water column, associated \n\nwith the relatively cool and low saline superficial layer, and gradually decreasing with depth \n\n(Figure 2.5). The highest Chl-a concentrations and cell densities were found off Cape Carvoeiro \n\nand further NW, where the northern valley cuts the shelf-break north of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. \n\nWhereas coccolithophore cell densities displayed only a weak positive correlation with \n\nphytoplankton biomass and no correlation with nutrients during the 1\nst\n leg (Figure 2.6), a strong \n\npositive correlation with phytoplankton biomass and a negative correlation with NOx and PO4 \n\nwas observed during the 2\nnd\n\n leg, reflecting the growth of coccolithophores at the expense of \n\nnutrients in the surface water layer (Figure 2.7). \n\nAdditional pigment data (C. S\u00e1 personal communication, data not presented in this study) \n\nrevealed that coccolithophores and diatoms, constituting the two dominant phytoplankton \n\ngroups, contributed equally to total Chl-a concentration during the 1\nst\n leg, with diatoms being \n\ngenerally more abundant at the surface and coccolithophores in deeper subsurface waters. \n\nDuring the 2\nnd\n\n leg, diatoms were clearly the dominant phytoplankton group and the main \n\ncontributor to Chl-a production, except further offshore where other groups recorded an increase \n\nof their relative abundances (station 251). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n                              \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Salinity (PSS-78) and nutrient concentrations (\u00b5mol/l) measured in the \n\nupper 100 m of the water column during the 1\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n leg of the cruise (light and dark \n\nsymbols, respectively). \n\nFigure 2.5 - Coccolithophore cell densities (cells/l) and phytoplankton biomass \n\n(Chl-a \u00b5g/l) in the upper 110 m of the water column, measured during the 1\nst\n \n\nleg (a) and 2\nnd\n\n leg (b) of the cruise. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Scatter plots of phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a, \u00b5g/l) and \n\nnutrient concentration (NOx, PO4, SiO2, \u00b5mol/l) versus coccolithophore cell \n\ndensity (cell/l) measured during the 1\nst\n leg of the cruise, showing a weak \n\npositive correlation between coccolithophore cell density and \n\nphytoplankton biomass, and no correlation between coccolithophore cell \n\ndensity and nutrients.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 - Scatter plots of phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a, \u00b5g/l) and nutrient \n\nconcentration (NOx, PO4, SiO2, \u00b5mol/l) versus coccolithophore cell density \n\n(cell/l) measured during the 2\nnd\n\n leg of the cruise, showing a strong positive \n\ncorrelation between coccolithophore cell density and phytoplankton biomass, \n\nand negative correlation with nutrients (particularly PO4 and NOx). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n66 \n\n2.4.4. Coccolithophore species diversity and ecological preferences \n\nA total of 35 distinct taxa of coccolithophores (coccospheres) were recognized. 19 species \n\nand four genera were identified using PLM whereas an additional Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscope analysis revealed 14 species belonging to the genera Syracosphaera, Ophiaster, \n\nAlisphaera and Acanthoica, and one species of holococcolithophore (for the complete list of \n\ntaxa, see Appendix A). Of the 35 identified coccolithophore taxa, only 10 reached cell densities \n\nof more than 2000 cells/l which we considered as significant for subsequent analysis. Mean and \n\nmaximum abundances of different taxa during the two legs, as determined from PLM \n\nobservations, are indicated in Table 2.1. The 10 more significant taxa were (in order of \n\nmaximum abundance): E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii, G. oceanica, G. muellerae, Syracosphaera spp. \n\n(dominated by S. marginoporata), C. mediterranea, Ophiaster spp. (dominated by O. \n\nhydroideus), Helicosphaera carteri, Syracolithus dalmaticus and A. robusta. Other plankton \n\ngroups observed on filters collected during the 2\nnd\n\n leg include diatoms (Chaetoceros sp., \n\nRhizosolenia sp., Skeletonema costatum, Thalassionema sp., Thalassiosira sp.), silicoflagellates \n\n(Dictyocha fibula), siliceous Chromista as Meringosphaera sp. and Prymnesium neolepis; and \n\ndinoflagellates (Ceratium sp., Protoperidinium sp.), calcareous dinoflagellates (Thoracosphaera \n\ns.l.), radiolarians (Sticholonche zanclea), choanoflagellates, tintinnids and foraminifera. \n\nThe strong increase in coccolithophore abundance observed during the 2\nnd\n\n leg of the \n\ncruise was mostly due to a strong increase of E. huxleyi, and to a lesser extent of G. oceanica \n\nand C. mediterranea (Figure 2.8). All three species can be characterized as surface dwellers, \n\nbeing consistently more abundant at the surface and gradually decreasing with depth.  \n\nG. ericsonii and S. dalmaticus had also increased during the 2\nnd\n\n leg, although less \n\nstrongly in comparison to the previous three species. G. ericsonii revealed a broad vertical \n\ndistribution during both legs, whereas S. dalmaticus was preferably more abundant at the \n\nuppermost 5\u201325 m (Figure 2.8). \n\nG. muellerae, Ophiaster spp. and Syracosphaera spp. kept similar cell densities during \n\nboth periods, although slightly decreasing their maxima during the 2\nnd\n\n leg. Whereas all three \n\nrevealed a broad vertical distribution, the latter two can be characterized as distinct subsurface \n\ndwellers.  \n\nH. carteri and A. robusta were generally low abundant during the cruise without a \n\nspecific water depth preference, although maxima of both were observed in the surface water \n\nlayer. \n\nDuring both legs, coccolithophore assemblages from the bottom nepheloid layer (BNL) \n\ngenerally appeared to reflect those from the surface water layer, dominated by the more \n\nproductive surface-dwelling species (E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii, G. oceanica and C. mediterranea) \n\nand, to a lesser extend from the subsurface dwelling taxa Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster \n\nspp. The maximum abundance of H. carteri during the cruise was observed in the BNL of \n\nstation 93, collected during the 1\nst\n leg.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Mean and maximum cell densities of the more important coccolithophore species (>2000 cells/l, observed under PLM), for each sampling period, with water \ncolumn depth, station and bottom depth for which maximum density was observed.

As illustrated by Figure 2.9, the large increase in \n\ncoccolithophore abundance from the 1\nst\n to the 2\n\nnd\n leg (from less than 4.3\u00d710\n\n4\n cells/l to more \n\nthan 14\u00d710\n4\n cells/l, respectively) was mostly accounted for by surface-dwelling taxa like E. \n\nhuxleyi, particularly in stations on the shelf and upper slope where the BP was well developed. \n\nThe boundary between the BP and the underlying winter mixed layer was marked by a distinct \n\nstep in T and S, clearly visible in all the CTD profiles, except those from the most offshore \n\nstations, where the plume is absent and the winter mixed layer occupies the entire water column \n\nup to the surface (stations 132 and 251). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 - Vertical distribution of the more abundant coccolithophore taxa (> 2000 cells/l) in the upper \n\n110 m of the water column during the 1\nst\n leg (light grey symbols) and 2\n\nnd\n leg (dark grey symbols). Boxes \n\nrepresent 1\nst\n, median and 3\n\nrd\n quartile of abundance distribution, whiskers represent minimum and \n\nmaximum abundance. Samples from the turbid bottom nepheloid layer (BNL) were counted separately \n\nand represented in the grey band marked BNL. Note that Total, E. huxleyi and Total except E.h. are \n\nrepresented on an order of magnitude higher abundance scale than all other taxonomic groups. \n\n \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n69 \n\nHighest cell densities of E. huxleyi occurred west of Cape Carvoeiro, where it appeared \n\nclosely associated with the highest Chl-a concentrations and maxima of small-chain diatom \n\nspecies considered to be 1\nst\n stage taxa in phytoplankton succession (Margalef, 1978) (e.g. \n\nThalassiosira spp., Chaetoceros spp., Skeletonema spp.). The significant increase of G. \n\noceanica and C. mediterranea during the 2\nnd\n\n leg appeared also closely related with the \n\nsuperficial BP. Maxima of G. oceanica occurred close to the coast west off Cape Carvoeiro \n\n(station 238), whereas the maximum of C. mediterranea was reached further offshore at the \n\nnorthern valley (station 146). In the latter area, modest increases in some other species such as \n\nSyracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp., were observed, as well as a broader vertical distribution \n\nof coccolithophores and stronger correlation between coccolithophore cells and phytoplankton \n\nbiomass (Chl-a). This makes the northern valley appear different from the area off Cape \n\nCarvoeiro.  \n\nA similar increase in abundance was not noticed in the most oceanward stations where \n\nthe BP was absent and the winter mixed layer occupied the entire water column up to the \n\nsurface (stations 132 and 251, respectively Figure 2.9c,f). In those stations, E. huxleyi was \n\nsubordinate to less prolific surface dwellers like G. ericsonii and subsurface dwellers like \n\nOphiaster spp. and Syracosphaera spp. even during the 2\nnd\n\n leg. The latter genera were observed \n\ndisplaying a broad vertical distribution along the entire 100 m at these distal locations. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.5. Multivariate analysis \n\nIn order to explore and statistically demonstrate the rapid response of coccolithophore \n\ntaxa (and phytoplankton s.l.) to the short-term environmental variations that occurred during the \n\ncruise, factor analysis was performed using the cell densities of the dominant coccolithophore \n\ntaxa and the physical\u2013biological proxies as variables in one single data matrix. In view of the \n\nvery different environmental conditions and ecological responses encountered during the two \n\nlegs of the cruise, factor analysis was performed on data from each of the two legs of the cruise \n\nseparately. Only the samples for which nutrient data were available were considered as cases in \n\nthe factor analysis. Since the lateral coast-to-ocean and vertical water column gradients appear \n\nas the most significant ecological gradients, factor scores were plotted against distance to coast \n\nand water depth (Figures 2.10\u20132.12).  \n\nFour factors explained 55 % and 73 % of the total variance in the data from, respectively, \n\nthe 1\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n leg, of which Factor 1 (F1) and Factor 2 (F2) were considered the most \n\nstatistically relevant for subsequent environmental analysis (Table 2.2).  \n\nFor the 1\nst\n leg, F1 (28 %) is mostly represented by nutrients (positive loadings) in \n\nopposition to salinity, temperature and Syracosphaera spp. (negative loadings), whereas F2 (13 \n\n%) is represented by Chl-a, Ophiaster spp. and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii (positive loadings). \n\nSamples influenced by the factor assemblage NOx, PO4 and SiO2 (F1 positive scores) are \n\nbetter represented at the surface water level close to the coast (Figure 2.10a). The lack of \n\nnutrient data at the surface of the more distal stations (i.e. 122 and 131) limits our perception \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 - Water column profiles of \n\nphytoplankton biomass (\u00b5g/l), \n\ntemperature (\u00b0C), salinity (PSS-78), \n\nsuspended particulate matter (FTU) and \n\ncoccolithophore assemblages from three \n\nrepresentative stations of the 1\nst\n leg of the \n\ncruise: Station 85 (306 m), Station 122 \n\n(1311 m) and Station 132 (3478 m), and \n\nthree stations of the 2\nnd\n\n leg of the cruise: \n\nStation 236 (100 m), Station 146 (171 m) \n\nand Station 251 (1589 m). \n\n \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n71 \n\nabout its latitudinal distribution at surface level.

Samples influenced by \n\nthe factor assemblage Chl-a, Ophiaster spp. and G. ericsonii (F2 positive scores) are \n\npreferentially distributed further offshore, revealing a rather broad vertical distribution (Figure \n\n2.10b).  \n\nFor the 2\nnd\n\n leg, F1 (38 %) is represented by temperature and salinity (positive loadings) in \n\nopposition to E. huxleyi, turbidity, Chl-a, G. oceanica, C. mediterranea, S. dalmaticus and H. \n\ncarteri (negative loadings), whereas F2 (16%) is represented by G. muellerae, Syracosphaera \n\nspp. and G. ericsonii (positive loadings) in opposition to temperature (negative loadings). \n\nSamples influenced by the factor assemblage E. huxleyi, turbidity, Chl-a, G. oceanica, C. \n\nmediterranea, S. dalmaticus and H. carteri (F1 negative scores) are better represented at the \n\nsurface water level in more neritic-coastal regions, i.e. off Cape Carvoeiro (Figure 2.11a) and at \n\nthe northern valley (Figure 2.12a).

The contrast between the two legs and the \n\nquick change of hydrographic conditions and related phytoplankton response is well represented \n\nby the lower versus higher statistical significance obtained for the 1\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n legs, respectively. \n\nLower percentage of explained variance obtained for the 1\nst\n leg reflects the more steady-state \n\nand low-productive ecological conditions during this period, when phytoplankton was not yet \n\nsignificantly developing, neither taking advantage from the nutrient-rich BP. Most of the \n\nphysical and biological variables, including the most abundant coccolithophore taxa, revealed a \n\ndistribution quite near the normal.

Buoyant plume dynamics during a late winter upwelling event \n\nThe reported hydrographic profiling and plankton sampling coincided with a period of \n\ntransient oceanographic and meteorological conditions, characteristic for the late winter period. \n\nRelatively warm and saline oceanic waters fed by the IPC were present in the winter mixed \n\nlayer which occupied the upper 100\u2013200 m of the water column over the shelf and upper slope, \n\nas typical during winter (e.g. Oliveira et al., 2004). A superficial layer of relatively cool and low \n\nsaline water capping the warmer and more saline winter mixed layer water was noticed during \n\nboth legs of the cruise. This buoyant plume was presumably fed by runoff from intense rainfall \n\nthat occurred prior to and at the beginning of the cruise. Fresh water was possibly originating \n\nfrom rivers north of the study area (e.g. Lis, Mondego, Douro rivers) as well as from small \n\nrivers flowing directly into the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head (e.g. Alc\u00f4a, Tornada and Arnoia rivers) \n\n(see Figure 2.1). Lowest salinities in the superficial layer, and strongest vertical gradients were \n\nrecorded during the 1\nst\n leg, along the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon.  \n\nEquatorward and offshore extension of the BP most probably occurred as a consequence \n\nof Ekman superficial dynamics driven by the prevailing northerly winds. As lighter waters were \n\ncontinuously being advected above the denser winter mixed layer, vertical stratification of the \n\nEkman layer increased and the seaward side of the BP was stretched. Nearer to the coast, the \n\ngreater thickness of the BP suggests that it was subject to mixing at its base with the underlying \n\ndenser waters which were brought up from deeper levels by the Ekman circulation. Whilst \n\nmixing was levelling off the vertical density gradient at the base of the plume along its coastal \n\nside, the BP continued to move in offshore direction until it eventually got separated from the \n\ncoast (see Fong and Geyer, 2001; Santos et al., 2004).  \n\nSimilar cases where local winds control the dynamics of river plumes and coastal \n\nupwelling have been described by several authors. Fong and Geyer (2001) argue that a \n\nmoderate-amplitude upwelling wind lasting a few days induces significant mixing in the plume, \n\nadvecting and spreading it far off the coast, whereas under sustained upwelling winds the plume \n\nis gradually spread out to nearly uniform thickness. Such has already been described from off \n\nthe Portuguese coast during occasional winter upwelling events, when Ekman surface \n\ncirculation was observed to advect the plume to more than 100 km offshore in a few days (Otero \n\net al., 2008). Convergence of the BP with the IPC was reported to occur at the shelf break, \n\nleading to local thickening of the plume, favouring the retention of biological material in this \n\narea (Peliz and Fi\u00faza, 1999; Santos et al., 2004; Ribeiro et al., 2005).  \n\nSuch a scenario appears to apply also to our cruise: whereas river runoff decreased, the \n\nnortherly wind-driven Ekman circulation persisted, causing the BP to spread further offshore \n\nand become detached from the coast. Nevertheless, contrary to summer upwelling episodes, \n\nduring which northerly winds are more intense and persistent over the Portuguese coast (e.g. \n\nPeliz et al., 2002; Alvarez-Salgado et al., 2003), the observed northerly wind event was \n\nprobably not persistent enough to bring nutrients from below the deep (~150 m) seasonal \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n75 \n \n\npycnocline (e.g. Ribeiro et al., 2005). Moreover, vertical profiles along the uppermost 1000 m \n\nof stations from the 1\nst\n leg (data not shown) revealed that nutrient concentrations significantly \n\ndecreased from the surface down to 250 m depth and thus, no significant input would be \n\nexpected from the levels immediately below the pycnocline. Therefore, the observed upwelling \n\nevent should be viewed in terms of its capacity to spread a thin nutrient-rich BP from the coast \n\ntowards offshore, rather than as a mechanism of nutrient replenishment from subsurface waters. \n\nThat highest nutrient concentrations were measured within the BP indicates that nutrients were \n\nbeing sourced mainly by runoff discharged by rivers prior to and at the beginning of the cruise.  \n\nIn comparison to some other areas of the world\u2019s oceans, nutrient concentrations during \n\nthe cruise can be considered as generally low (Levitus et al., 1993), but enough to support the \n\nphytoplankton communities thriving in this area (see Section 2.4.2). N:P ratios falling below the \n\ntypical 16:1 Redfield ratio in surface waters during the 2\nnd\n\n leg point at nitrogen as the main \n\nlimiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth, in good agreement with several studies within \n\ncoastal waters (Redfield, 1958; Redfield et al., 1963; Ryther and Dunstan, 1971; Fisher et al., \n\n1992; Labry et al., 2002; Mendes et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5.2. Productivity variations on a weekly basis \n\nResults presented in this study strikingly illustrate the rapid response of phytoplankton to \n\nfavourable environmental conditions. A brief period of northerly winds was enough to promote \n\nspreading of the nutrient-rich BP, favouring a massive increase in phytoplankton biomass and \n\ncoccolithophore cell densities from the 1\nst\n to the 2\n\nnd\n leg of the cruise. \n\nVertical stratification associated with the BP appears to have acted as a mechanism \n\nretaining both nutrients and cells within the sunlit surface layer, leading to a remarkable \n\nphytoplankton bloom in the otherwise relatively nutrient-poor oceanic conditions that prevail \n\nduring winter on the central Portuguese margin (see Santos et al., 2004; Ribeiro et al., 2005). \n\nCells and nutrients were clearly associated with the salinity minima of the BP and were \n\nprobably advected along with it. This would explain why the highest concentrations of Chl-a \n\nand coccolithophore cells occurred preferentially at the surface of the more distal part of the \n\ntransect west off Cape Carvoeiro, where the BP was thinner and more sharply defined at the \n\nsurface. A map of Chl-a average concentration for March 2010 obtained from satellite data (see \n\nFigure B in Auxiliary Material) illustrates the broad spreading of this Chl-a enrichment, \n\nextending from the coast to the middle shelf region, and apparently originating from the north.  \n\nAlthough nutrients were already available at the time of the 1\nst\n leg of the cruise, and \n\nprobably were still being replenished by runoff from land, a clear response in phytoplankton \n\nproductivity was only observed during the 2\nnd\n\n leg. Such delay may be explained partly by the \n\nhigher advective mixing between the BP and shelf's ambient waters and significant cloud \n\ncoverage during the 1\nst\n leg (see Figure 2.2). When river runoff had decreased at the end of the \n\n1\nst\n leg, the intensity of mixing between the BP and the denser water layer below probably \n\nweakened, leading to stabilization of the vertical stratification (see Ribeiro et al., 2005). The \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n76 \n\nretention of cells within the BP promoted exposure of phytoplankton to sunlight and allowed \n\ncell division to remain constant as long as the cells remained inside the BP (e.g. Smetacek and \n\nPassow, 1990; Ribeiro et al., 2005). With nutrient availability ensured within the BP, light \n\nseems logically the ultimate factor needed to set off the phytoplankton bloom. Clear skies and \n\nslight increase of PAR (see Figure 2.2) occurring in the interval between the two legs of the \n\ncruise may have provided the required favourable light conditions. \n\nAnother factor that possibly contributed to the establishment of favourable conditions for \n\nphytoplankton to bloom within the surface layer was the relatively low suspended sediment load \n\nin the BP, therefore not significantly reducing light availability. River floods occurring in \n\nautumn and early winter, when river basins are still loaded with accumulated fine sediments, \n\ntend to discharge much more turbid waters onto the shelf, thereby inhibiting phytoplankton \n\ngrowth. Waters discharged as a result of the late winter flood prior to our cruise were probably \n\nrelatively clear. The moderate sea wave conditions also contributed to the generally low \n\nturbidity values during the cruise, and to the persistence of the water stratification, long enough \n\nto allow the development of a phytoplankton bloom at the surface. Even so, settling of \n\nsuspended sediment from the BP as it spread out in offshore direction may have played a role in \n\nimproving light conditions near the surface as well as in deeper water. Change from a \n\nsuspension-related turbidity during the 1\nst\n leg, to phytoplankton-related turbidity during the 2\n\nnd\n \n\nleg supports this hypothesis (see Figure A in Auxiliary Material). \n\nWind-driven turbulence, water stratification and mixed-layer depth were already \n\ndemonstrated to be important factors controlling phytoplankton access to its basic requirements \n\nfor growth: light and nutrients (Doyon et al., 2000; Kudela et al., 2005). The importance of river \n\nrunoff in providing nutrients to phytoplankton communities, and stratification of the upper \n\nwater column as a key-factor in the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms during winter and \n\nspring on the Portuguese continental shelf, have also been confirmed by several authors (Peliz \n\nand Fi\u00faza, 1999; Moita, 2001; Varela et al., 2001; Ribeiro et al., 2005; De Castro et al., 2006). \n\nMoita (2001) found that Chl-a peaks during winter were associated with runoff-driven \n\nhaline-stratification, particularly north of Cape Carvoeiro, and that phytoplankton growth during \n\nspring occurred at the expense of nutrients replenished during winter when thermal stratification \n\nwas still weakly developed. During this transient period the relatively well-mixed water column \n\nshowed a certain degree of stability at the uppermost water levels, where blooms occurred very \n\nclose to the surface following calm and relatively warm days and in the presence of some \n\nhaline-stratification. Peliz and Fi\u00faza (1999), analysing Coastal Zone Colour Scanner images \n\nobtained between 1979 and 1985, concluded that the highest Chl-a concentrations occurred in \n\nwinter over the shelf and slope, extending to large distances off the coast. They appeared \n\nassociated with the offshore spreading of river plumes, eventually occupying the whole shelf \n\nand slope zone in about one week (e.g. Peliz and Fi\u00faza, 1999; Santos et al., 2004). The role of \n\nCape Carvoeiro in rapidly redirecting the nutrient-rich BP further offshore, following similar \n\ndynamics as associated with the generation of chlorophyll-rich upwelling filaments extending to \n\nthe ocean during summer, should not be discarded (e.g. Fi\u00faza, 1983; Haynes et al., 1993; Peliz \n\net al., 2002). \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n77 \n \n\nThe late winter bloom here described occurred at the expense of nutrients within the BP, \n\nas indicated by the significant decrease of NOx, PO4 and SiO2 at the surface. A lesser decrease \n\nin nutrient concentrations at deeper levels is indicative of lower consumption rates below the \n\nsurface (Figure 2.4). Chl-a concentrations reported in this study revealed to be much higher than \n\nso far reported from the Portuguese margin, with a maximum Chl-a of 13 mg/l off Cape \n\nCarvoeiro, compared to 4.3 mg/l in the Nazar\u00e9 canyon region in June of 2006 (Mendes et al., \n\n2011), max. 4.6 mg/l off Cape S. Vicente and along the coastal region north of Cape Carvoeiro, \n\nduring summer, and max. 6.3 mg/l off Faro, during spring (Moita, 2001), max. ~3.5 mg/l in the \n\nNW region of the Portuguese shelf, February of 2000 (Ribeiro et al., 2005), and max. 5.3 mg/l \n\nin Lisbon Bay, February 2005 (Silva et al., 2009). The winter\u2013spring transition may thus lead to \n\na stronger ecological response than occurring during the summer-upwelling season, when wind \n\nand sunlight conditions are usually more persistently favourable. \n\nPigment data from this period indicate that diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton \n\ngroup and the main contributor for Chl-a production, particularly at the uppermost water layer \n\n(data not shown). The conspicuous depletion of SiO2 at the surface, observed especially off \n\nCape Carvoeiro therefore likely reflects the bloom of small-chain diatoms (see Margalef, 1978). \n\nRapid exhaustion of silica by diatoms apparently led coccolithophores to profit from NOx and \n\nPO4 still available at the surface, contributing to their unexpectedly rapid and significant bloom \n\nnear the coast. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5.3. Coccolithophore ecological preferences \n\nOften considered as a uniform functional group of calcifying phytoplankton thriving in \n\nlow-turbulence, low-nutrients and high-light environments, results presented in this study \n\nclearly show that coccolithophore life strategies are much more diverse than expected. The most \n\nstriking ecological variations occurred along the coastal-oceanic lateral gradient and vertically \n\nalong the upper photic layer. It is clear that some taxa were favoured by the offshore spread of \n\nthe BP, taking profit from nutrient and light availability at the surface, whereas others preferably \n\ndeveloped below the surface and further offshore, away from the influence of river runoff (see \n\nFigures 2.9\u20132.12). Results from factor analysis clearly confirmed such short-term ecological \n\nchanges. \n\nFactor analysis for the 1\nst\n leg clearly illustrates the strongest contrast between the coastal-\n\nneritic region affected by nutrient rich runoff waters in the BP and the oceanic mixed water \n\nmass further offshore observed in this period. Only few coccolithophore species displayed some \n\ndirect relation with such lateral gradient: subsurface dweller Syracosphaera spp. preferably \n\nassociated to more oceanic and oligotrophic water conditions below the surface and along the \n\nentire uppermost 100 m further offshore (F1, Figure 2.10a), whereas Ophiaster spp., G. \n\nericsonii and, to a lesser extent, C. mediterranea, were more associated to (low) phytoplankton \n\nproductivity (Biom Chl-a) occurring at the surface closer to the coast (F2, Figure 2.10b). \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n78 \n\nThe observed coccolithophore bloom at the expense of nutrients within the BP is clearly \n\nshowed by factor analysis performed for the 2\nnd\n\n leg. E. huxleyi, G. oceanica and C. \n\nmediterranea were the more productive and contributor species for the remarkable increase of \n\nChl-a observed in this period (F1, Figures 2.11 and 2.12a), whereas G. muellerae, \n\nSyracosphaera spp., G. ericsonii and Ophiaster spp. were more independent from the nutrient-\n\nrich BP and preferentially developing offshore, outside the influence of runoff (F2, Figure \n\n2.12b). \n\nThe observed dominance of E. huxleyi during both low- and high productivity periods \n\nduring the cruise is in good agreement with its presumed cosmopolitan and opportunistic \n\nbehaviour (Winter et al., 1994; Baumann et al., 2000; Andruleit, 2007; Boeckel and Baumann, \n\n2008). The remarkable occurrence of E. huxleyi together with small-chain diatoms and \n\nsignificantly contributing to phytoplankton biomass during the high productive period, supports \n\nearlier observations identifying it as an early succession r-selected species, capable of rapid \n\ngrowth within nutrient-rich, turbulent environments (e.g. Giraudeau and Bayley, 1995; \n\nAndruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Sprengel et al., 2002; Andruleit, 2007; Silva et al., 2008) and \n\nconstituting the main bloom-forming coccolithophore (e.g. Okada and Honjo, 1973; \n\nKnappertsbusch and Brummer, 1995; Garcia et al., 2011; Souza et al. 2011). \n\nG. oceanica was apparently \u201cdormant\u201d during the low-productive period (1\nst\n leg) but \n\nrapidly developed as soon as nutrient-light stratification conditions became favourable during \n\nthe 2\nnd\n\n leg. It manifests itself as one of the species better adapted to thrive within nutrient-rich, \n\ncompetitive conditions near the coast, although not reaching cell densities as high as those of E. \n\nhuxleyi. Results agree with several authors referring to it as a typical coastal coccolithophore, \n\nwell adapted to the nutrient-rich and productive environment off Portugal (Silva et al., 2008), \n\nand as maximum upwelling indicator, based on its quick response to nutrient input (Winter et \n\nal., 1994; Giraudeau and Bayley, 1995; Broerse et al., 2000; Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; \n\nSprengel et al., 2002; Andruleit et al., 2003). \n\nC. mediterranea was also able to profit from nutrient favourable conditions during the \n\ncruise and flourished in the 2\nnd\n\n leg, although less prominently than the two latter, and more \n\ndisplaced towards the shelf-break region, at the northern valley. Silva et al. (2008) and Moita et \n\nal. (2010) also reported the presence of high cell densities of C. mediterranea off the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nregion during winter, referring to it as a good tracer for the convergence of subtropical waters \n\n(ENACWst) onto the Portuguese shelf during the upwelling-downwelling transition. \n\nDespite the generally low abundance of S. dalmaticus, correlation of this species with E. \n\nhuxleyi, G. oceanica and C. mediterranea, closer to the coast off Cape Carvoeiro, suggest that it \n\nhas some capacity to profit from nutrient availability, in the context of moderate-to-low \n\nturbulence within coastal regions. This contradicts previous studies which associate \n\nholococcolithophores with more oligotrophic and oceanic environments (i.e. Mediterranean Sea, \n\nNE Atlantic, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, Kleijne, 1991). \n\nObservations on Syracosphaera spp. are consistent with Andruleit (2007) in terms of its \n\nbroad depth range but contradict several studies reporting this genus as having affinity for \n\nnutrient availability in coastal regions (e.g. Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Andruleit, 2007). In \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n79 \n \n\naddition, little is known about S. marginoporata, the dominant species within this group (max. \n\n1.4\u00d710\n4\n cells/l counted with SEM). The same applies to Ophiaster spp. which, similarly to \n\nSyracosphaera spp., includes a variety of species which cannot be distinguished with PLM but \n\nwhich are expected to have distinct ecological preferences (Young, 1994). Lack of taxonomical \n\ndifferentiation and of a systematic quantification of typical nutrient levels in the above-\n\nmentioned studies may partially explain discrepancies with the present study. \n\nG. ericsonii was the second most abundant species during the cruise, next to E. huxleyi, \n\nconfirming its preference for nutrient enriched coastal/neritic regions inferred by several authors \n\n(e.g. California Current System, Winter et al., 1979; south of Benguela upwelling system, \n\nGiraudeau and Bayley, 1995; Lisbon Bay, Silva et al., 2008). Yet, its highest cell densities \n\nfurther offshore during the high productivity period, away from the influence of the BP and \n\ncoastal turbulence, suggest that it is better adapted to compete with E. huxleyi in oceanic \n\nconditions than in coastal waters. Although with much lower abundances, G. muellerae \n\ndisplayed an ecological performance similar to G. ericsonii: higher abundances and coastal-\n\nneritic distribution during the 1\nst\n leg and better performance in more oceanic regions during the \n\nhigh-productive period, suggesting it has a more oligotrophic behaviour on the central \n\nPortuguese margin, in comparison to other placolith-bearing species (i.e. G. oceanica and E. \n\nhuxleyi). The two species are apparently able to thrive and dominate the coccolithophore \n\ncommunity under steady-state low-productive conditions over the shelf, but not when shelf and \n\ncoastal waters become favourable for r-selected species like E. huxleyi and G. oceanica. \n\nThe observed higher diversity of coccolithophore species, broader vertical distribution \n\nand stronger correlation between cells and phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) at the shelf-break \n\nregion (northern valley), possibly reflect the dominance of this group within more distal regions. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6. Conclusions \n\nCoccolithophores off central Portugal showed a rapid response to regional meteorological \n\nand hydrographic variations occurring in late winter between 9 and 19 March 2010, either \n\ntaking profit of nutrient availability in coastal-neritic areas and competing with other r-selected \n\nphytoplankton groups (e.g. small-chain diatoms), or preferentially developing in more oceanic-\n\noligotrophic regions, where competition with r-selected taxa is expectedly lower. \n\nOver the relatively warm and saline winter mixed layer water occupying the upper 100\u2013\n\n200 m of the water column over the shelf and upper slope, a superficial nutrient-rich Buoyant \n\nPlume (BP) of relatively cool and low-saline water, presumably fed by runoff from intense \n\nrainfall that occurred prior to and at the beginning of the cruise, was spread out equatorwards \n\nand offshore, most probably as a consequence of Ekman superficial dynamics generated by the \n\nprevailing northerly winds. Whereas river runoff decreased, the Ekman circulation driven by the \n\nnortherly wind made the BP to spread further offshore and become detached from the coast. \n\nDespite relatively high nutrient availability within the BP, cloud cover and initial relatively high \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n80 \n\nturbidity within the BP resulted in sub-optimal light conditions unfavourable for the growth of \n\nphytoplankton (Figure 2.13a). \n\nIn the transition towards the 2\nnd\n\n leg, stable density stratification, decreasing turbidity at \n\nthe surface and prevailing clear skies finally allowed phytoplankton to take advantage of the \n\nnutrients retained in the BP. In the shelf and upper slope area covered by the BP, E. huxleyi and \n\nG. oceanica were the coccolithophore species that benefited the most from favourable nutrient \n\nconditions within the sunlit layer. C. mediterranea and S. dalmaticus also responded to the \n\nfavourable conditions, although less notably than the first two species (Figure 2.13b). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13 \u2013 Schematic representation of the environmental conditions that contributed to the late winter \n\ncoccolithophore bloom observed during the cruise: (a) 1\nst\n leg, low-productive pre-bloom period: the wind \n\nregime was shifting from southerlies to northerlies, and the vertical gradient between the BP and the \n\nwinter mixed layer was strongest due to still significant river discharge; (b) period between legs: clear sky \n\nconditions were most favorable, runoff driven turbidity at the surface had decreased, and northerly wind \n\nforced Ekman circulation of the BP was strongest, all factors contributing to trigger the phytoplankton \n\nand coccolithophore bloom in the BP; (c) 2\nnd\n\n leg, high-productive bloom period: significant Chl-a and \n\ncell concentrations were recording a bloom at the surface, at the expense of nutrient provided by the \n\nplume, with E. huxleyi, G. oceanica and C. mediterranea revealing a remarkable increase of abundance \n\nbetween the coast and the shelf-break. During this time, the BP was relatively more mixed with the \n\nunderneath winter layer, the wind regime changed back to southerlies and an increase of cloud coverage \n\nwas noticed (C. mediterranea \u2013 Cm; E. huxleyi \u2013 Eh; G. ericsonii \u2013 Ge; G. muellerae \u2013 Gm; G. oceanica \n\n\u2013 Go; Ophiaster spp. - Ophi; Syraco. dalmaticus \u2013 Sdalm; S. marginoporata \u2013 SM; Buoyant Plume \u2013 \n\nBP).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLate winter coccolithophore bloom \n\n81 \n \n\nSyracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. were the most consistently oligotrophic taxa, \n\nconstituting an important component in offshore assemblages and displaying a broad vertical \n\ndistribution extending well below the nutrient-rich surface layer in the more coastal-neritic \n\nregions. G. ericsonii and G. muellerae decreased in abundance in shelf and upper slope waters, \n\nbut increased in the most offshore waters where E. huxleyi was not significantly developing \n\n(Figure 2.13a). \n\nThe observed rapid response of coccolithophores to short-term meteorological and \n\nhydrographic variability presents a challenge to the application of coccoliths in paleoclimatic \n\nand paleoceanographic reconstructions, and demonstrates the need for improved knowledge of \n\nthe ecological characteristics of this group. \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements - This research was supported by the HERMIONE project (EC contract 226354) \n\nfunded by the European Commission and the Cd Tox-CoN project (FCT-PTDC/MAR/102800/2008) \n\nfunded by the Portuguese Science Foundation FCT.

Deep-Sea Research, Special Issue \u2013 Submarine \n\ncanyons. \n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThis paper presents a first attempt to characterize coccolithophore assemblages occurring \n\nin the context of an active submarine canyon. Coccolithophores from the upper-middle sections \n\nof the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (central Portuguese margin) - one of the largest canyons of the European \n\ncontinental margin - were investigated during a late winter period (9 \u2013 12 March 2010). Species \n\ndistributions were analyzed in a multiparameter environmental context (temperature, salinity, \n\nturbidity, Chl-a and nutrient concentrations). Monthly averaged surface water Chl-a \n\nconcentration between 2006 and 2011 assessed from satellite data is also presented, as a \n\nframework for interpreting spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton in the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon. \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon was observed to act as a conduit for advection of relatively nutrient-\n\npoor oceanic waters of ENACWst origin into nearshore areas of the continental shelf (less than \n\n10 km off the coast), whilst at the surface a nutrient-rich buoyant plume resulting from intensive \n\ncoastal runoff prior and during the beginning of the cruise was spreading in oceanward \n\ndirection.  \n\nTwo distinct coccolithophore assemblages appear representative for the coast to open \n\nocean gradient: (1) Emiliania huxleyi together with Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Coronosphaera \n\nmediterranea dominated the more productive assemblage present within coastal-neritic surface \n\nwaters; and (2) Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. displayed a higher affinity with open-\n\nocean conditions, and also generally a broader vertical distribution. Local \u201chotspots\u201d of \n\ncoccolithophore and phytoplankton biomass potentially associated with perturbations of surface \n\nwater circulation by the canyon are discussed. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Living coccolithophores; Chl-a; ENACWst; submarine canyon  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n86 \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nSubmarine canyons incising the continental margins are prominent topographic features \n\nthat modify the coastal circulation. By intensifying shelf-slope exchange of water and \n\norganic/inorganic matter they play a key-role in global biogeochemical cycling (e.g. Durrieu de \n\nMadron, 1994; Gardner, 1989; Hickey et al., 1986; Monaco et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2003). \n\nNarrow canyons tend to have a stronger effect on low-frequency circulation, whereas wider \n\ncanyons mainly cause bottom flow adjustment along isobaths (Klinck, 1988). Stratification of \n\nthe water column reduces the canyon\u2019s topographic effect on the coastal flow (Hickey, 1997; \n\nShe and Klinck, 2000).  \n\nIn the upper water layers (above 100 m), the influence of the canyon is only gentle, with \n\nthe along-shelf flow turning slightly onshore upstream of the canyon and turning offshore \n\ndownstream. Closer to the canyon rims (100-200 m) the along-shelf flow is more strongly \n\ndeflected in onshore direction, turning back on the downstream side of the canyon, with \n\nupwelling or downwelling occurring above the rims, depending on the wind direction (She and \n\nKlinck, 2000). In the Northern Hemisphere right-bounded flows (i.e. coast to the right, looking \n\ndownstream) induce downwelling conditions within the canyon, whereas left-bounded flows \n\nfavor the occurrence of upwelling (Klinck, 1996; She and Klinck, 2000). Upwelling occurs \n\nmostly at the canyon head and downstream rim and adjacent shelf (Allen, 1996; Klinck, 1996; \n\nMendes et al., 2011; She and Klinck, 2000). Under downwelling conditions, the canyon acts as \n\na trap for converging shelf water (Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). \n\nThe intensification of both coast to ocean and vertical water transport within submarine \n\ncanyons is expected to affect the dynamics of plankton ecosystems in the vicinity of canyons \n\n(see Bosley et al., 2004; Hickey, 1995; Kampf, 2006; Ryan et al., 2005; 2010; Skliris et al., \n\n2002; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). Indeed a strong response of phytoplankton production to \n\ncanyon flows, and concentration of marine organisms by physical processes within and around \n\ncanyons were reported from several studies (e.g. Bosley et al. 2004; Macquart-Moulin and \n\nPatriti, 1996; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006).  \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, located at the central Portuguese margin and one of the largest \n\nsubmarine canyons of Europe, has been relatively intensely explored with regards to its \n\ngeology, geomorphology, oceanography and benthic biology (e.g. Tyler et al., 2009). Little is \n\nknown, however, about the plankton communities thriving in this region, and about the \n\ncanyon\u2019s effect on their ecology.  \n\nGuerreiro et al. (submitted-b) (Chapter 4) observed a relatively higher diversity of \n\ncoccolith species, including both oceanic and coastal-neritic taxa but with a relative dominance \n\nof the latter, in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon in comparison to the adjacent shelf/slope regions. This was \n\ninterpreted as reflecting the exchange of water masses between coastal and oceanic regions \n\nthrough the canyon, as well as the dynamic and nutrient-rich conditions where the coastal \n\nspecies are better adapted to survive. Locally enhanced productivity in the surroundings of the \n\ncanyon may be related to persistent physical phenomena associated with the canyon such as \n\nvertical mixing by solitary internal waves (Quaresma et al. 2007), and/or upwelling in the \n\n\n\nInfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n87 \n\ncanyon head (Guerreiro et al., 2009). Evidence for local enhancement of phytoplankton \n\nproductivity is also provided by observations on phytoplankton pigments reported by Mendes et \n\nal. (2011), with maximum values of Chl-a (indicative of phytoplankton in general) near the \n\ncanyon head and maximum values of 19\u2019 hexanoyloxyfucoxantine pigment (indicative of \n\ncoccolithophores) found in the area north of the canyon.  \n\nHere we report the results obtained from a plankton survey on living coccolithophores \n\nfrom the upper-middle Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, during late winter (9 \u2013 12 March 2010) (Figure 3.1). On \n\nthe basis of a detailed characterization of the coccolithophore assemblages together with a \n\ngeneral characterization of environmental conditions prevailing during the sampling period, the \n\nimpact of this major submarine canyon on coccolithophores and phytoplankton biomass is \n\ndiscussed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Regional setting \n\n3.2.1. Oceanography  \n\nThe central Portuguese continental margin is characterized by a relatively narrow shelf of \n\na few tens of km width, with a maximum of ~70 km where it projects oceanward in the \n\nEstremadura promontory, but cut back to very close to shore where it is incised by the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nand Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyons. The Douro and Tagus are the most important rivers debouching \n\non the shelf, with relatively minor contribution of continental runoff from other rivers. From the \n\nshelf edge located at 160-200 m, a steep upper slope and more gently inclined lower slope \n\nincised by numerous gullies and canyons, lead down to the Iberia and Tagus abyssal plains. \n\nSurface water circulation along the Portuguese margin is directly dependent on two main \n\ncurrent systems transporting water eastwards across the North Atlantic: the North Atlantic \n\nCurrent extending to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, and the Azores Current south of Iberia \n\n(Barton, 2001;  Peliz et al., 2005; Pollard and Pu, 1985; Saunders, 1982). As the Azores Current \n\nextends eastwards, branches of this current loop smoothly into the Portugal Current and further \n\nsouth into the Canary Current. The Portugal Current slowly flows southwards, west of Portugal, \n\ncarrying about 2\u00d710\n6\n m\n\n3\n/s in the upper 200 m of the water column. It partially continues further \n\nsouth into the Canary Current, while another part apparently enters the Mediterranean within a \n\nshallow surface layer (Barton, 2001; Saunders, 1982). \n\nThe upper 500 m of water column off Portugal, including the surface mixed layer and the \n\nfirst thermocline, is constituted by the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW). This \n\nwater mass, representing the main source of the nutrient-rich upwelled waters on the Portuguese \n\ncoast, shows considerable variation in its hydrological features as it travels along the coast \n\n(Fi\u00faza, 1984; McCave and Hall, 2002). The ENACW has two main components of different \n\norigin that converge to this region: a lighter, relatively warm and salty subtropical branch \n\n(ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually loses its characteristics as it \n\ntravels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline colder water mass of subpolar \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n88 \n\norigin (ENACWsp) slowly flowing southwards below the poleward subtropical branch, related \n\nwith the Subpolar Mode Water formed in the eastern North Atlantic by winter cooling and deep \n\nconvection (Fi\u00faza et al., 1998). \n\nBeneath the near-surface equatorward flow of the Portugal and Canary currents, the \n\nIberian Poleward Current (IPC) can be recognized traveling poleward, counter to the general \n\ncirculation and closely bound to the continental slope, its core extending about 300-400 m \n\nvertically. This current is mostly restricted to the subsurface layers along most of the eastern \n\nsubtropical gyre, but surfaces whenever the Trade Winds weaken or turn northward (Barton, \n\n2001). \n\nCirculation along the Portuguese shelf and upper slope is markedly seasonal, associated \n\nto the annual cycle of two major atmospheric systems: the Azores high and Iceland low pressure \n\nsystem, respectively (e.g. Barton, 2001; Haynes et al., 1993; Relvas et al., 2007). During \n\nsummer, the Azores high pressure system migrates towards the central Atlantic, typically \n\ninducing Trade Winds to become northerly, inducing an equatorward circulation over the upper \n\n150-200 m of the water column off Portugal. During winter, when the Azores high pressure \n\nsystem is located further south and the Iceland low pressure system intensifies, the dominant \n\nwind regime becomes southerly along the western Portuguese margin. This induces shoaling of \n\nthe IPC over the upper slope and shelf, where the poleward flow produces an onshore Ekman \n\ntransport, in turn resulting in downwelling conditions over the shelf (Fi\u00faza, 1983; Vitorino et \n\nal., 2002).  \n\nRiver runoff is an important feature of the winter circulation over the western Portuguese \n\nmargin, through which a significant discharge of low salinity water occurs into the coastal \n\nocean. This results in buoyant plumes that either develop into inshore currents (Relvas et al., \n\n2007; Otero et al., 2008) or expand further offshore, under the influence of, respectively, \n\nsoutherly or northerly-winds over the shelf and slope (Otero et al., 2008). The Western Iberian \n\nBuoyant Plume, characterized by low salinity (<35.8) and low temperature compared to normal \n\nshelf waters, is mostly fed by outflow from rivers of northen Portugal (Mondego, Douro, \n\nMinho, Lima, Vouga). Besides these major rivers, other smaller rivers and lagoons contribute as \n\nwell.  \n\nInterannual variability of circulation along the Portuguese shelf and slope is influenced by \n\nthe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), resulting from fluctuations in the difference of \n\natmospheric pressure between the Azores high and the Iceland low. NAO high index conditions \n\ntypically are associated with an increase of the trade winds that bring moist air into Europe, \n\nresulting in cool summers and mild and wet winters in Europe and its Atlantic forefront. On the \n\ncontrary, NAO low index conditions leads to more extreme atmospheric temperatures, \n\nproducing heat-waves and deep freezing, and an increase of storm activity and rainfall in \n\nsouthern Europe and North Africa. Several studies have indicated a decreasing intensity and \n\nincreasing frequency in upwelling events, occurring even during the winter period (e.g. Alvarez \n\net al., 2009; Barton, 2001; Ribeiro et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008; Vitorino et \n\nal., 2002), apparently linked with a trend towards the \u201chigh index\u201d mode of the NAO observed \n\nover the last decades, leading also to mild, wet winters over northern Europe and dry conditions \n\n\n\nInfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n89 \n\nover Portugal (Barton, 2001; Wallace, 2002).  \n\nIn addition to thermohaline and wind-driven circulation, tidal currents are also important \n\nin influencing the hydrodynamics of the Portuguese margin. Particularly where the M2 semi-\n\ndiurnal tidal current, the dominant tidal constituent over the Portuguese margin, forces stratified \n\nupper ocean water over the abrupt topography of the slope and shelf-break (e.g. Quaresma and \n\nPichon, 2011), tidal energy is transferred into baroclinic motions in the form of internal waves \n\nand internal tides. These are very important in mixing the ocean water column, enhancing \n\nvertical nutrient transport and thus phytoplankton productivity (e.g. Guerreiro et al., 2009), as \n\nwell as in increasing bottom turbulence over the continental shelf and slope, triggering bottom \n\nsediment resuspension and transport (Huthnance et al., 2002). \u201cHotspots\u201d of internal tide \n\ngeneration on the Portuguese margin appear associated with submarine canyons cutting across \n\nthe shelf and slope (e.g. Portim\u00e3o canyon, Bruno et al., 2006; Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, Quaresma et al., \n\n2007; Quaresma and Pichon, 2011) and with promontories of the continental shelf (e.g. \n\nEstremadura spur, Quaresma and Pichon, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Nazar\u00e9 Canyon  \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, the largest submarine canyon of the Portuguese margin, cuts \n\ncompletely across the shelf and slope, from less than 1 km from the coastline off the village of \n\nNazar\u00e9 at a water depth of about 50 m to a distance of >210 km from the coast and a water \n\ndepth of 5000 m. An upper, middle and lower section can be distinguished on the basis of \n\ngeneral morphology and characteristics of the hydrodynamic and sedimentary environment \n\n(Vanney and Mougenot, 1990; De Stigter et al., 2007; Lastras et al., 2009). The upper canyon \n\nsection consists of a narrow and distinctly V-shaped meandering valley that lies deeply \n\nentrenched in the shelf. Beyond the shelf edge, it passes into the much broader and U-shaped \n\nmiddle section incised in the continental slope. The lower canyon section consists of a broad \n\nand flat-floored valley at the base of the slope, opening at 5000 m water depth into the Iberia \n\nAbyssal Plain. \n\nThe physical oceanography of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon has been summarised by Tyler et al. \n\n(2009), largely on the basis of CTD and current meter data collected by the Portuguese \n\nHydrographic Institute and Royal NIOZ (final reports of the EUROSTRATAFORM, HERMES \n\nand HERMIONE European projects). \n\nInside the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, residual currents are generally aligned along the canyon axis \n\nas the result of strong topographical control. The current alignment extends well above the \n\ncanyon edges (~150 m depth) implying substantial disturbance of the predominant north-south \n\ncirculation parallel to the general trend of the shelf and slope.  \n\nAt depths shallower than 300 m, the residual currents inside the canyon show a distinct \n\ncoupling to the wind-driven current regime over the continental shelf. During winter, the \n\noccurrence of downwelling conditions over the shelf results in a down-canyon residual flow \n\nnear or just above the canyon edge. Under strong upwelling conditions and southward flow \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n90 \n\nacross the shelf, onshore (up-canyon) flow is observed in the upper canyon, with intensification \n\nof upwelling near the canyon head. The enhancement of upwelling and associated bottom \n\nresuspension can be expected to provide a nutrient source supporting enhanced phytoplankton \n\nconcentration south of the canyon (e.g. Hickey, 1995; Kampf, 2006). This seems to be \n\nconfirmed by observations by Mendes et al. (2011) regarding phytopigment distribution patterns \n\nin surficial waters around the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, with maximum concentrations of diatoms \n\noccurring south of the canyon.  \n\nThe interaction of the external (barotropic) tide off the Portuguese coast with the canyon \n\ntopography, in the presence of water stratification, leads to the generation of internal \n\n(baroclinic) tides (i.e. internal waves of tidal period), which radiate from the generation point \n\nand propagate the tidal energy vertically (Quaresma et al., 2007; Tyler et al., 2009). Strong \n\nsemi-diurnal bottom currents occur in all parts of the canyon, particularly in its upper and \n\nmiddle sections (commonly exceeding 30 cm/s) which, along with the ample supply of fine-\n\ngrained sediments from the shelf, result in the permanent haze of suspended matter in the upper \n\ncanyon (De Stigter et al., 2007).  \n\nThe generation of non-linear internal waves (NIW) at the canyon\u2019s northern shelf break \n\nand their refraction towards NE was observed by Quaresma et al. (2007) mainly during summer, \n\nwhen stratification of the shelf waters supports the waves. Observations indicate that the NIW \n\nmost likely result from the interaction of the semidiurnal M2 barotropic tide with the canyon \n\nrim, displaying horizontal and vertical velocities strong enough to resuspend bottom sediments \n\nalong the wave propagation path from the middle to the inner shelf. The injection of nutrients \n\nfrom the lower toward the upper levels of the water column forced by the shoreward \n\npropagation of these NIW has been invoked to explain high concentrations of coccoliths found \n\nin the sedimentary cover in this near shore position (Guerreiro et al., 2009). Although this \n\nmechanism occurs mainly during spring and summer, it seems persistent enough to explain such \n\nanomaly in coccolith distribution.  \n\nIn autumn and winter, violent westerly storms generating waves with significant height \n\nup to 9 m cause widespread sediment resuspension on the shelf and downwelling of turbid \n\nwaters towards the canyon. The location of the canyon head at less than 1 km from the shore \n\nmakes it particularly prone to trap particulate matter transported as bedload and in suspension \n\nalong the shelf (De Stigter et al., 2007; Oliveira et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nInfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n91 \n\n3.3. Material and methods  \n\n3.3.1. Sample collection  \n\nSampling was conducted between 9 and 12 of March 2010, on board of NRP \u201cAlmirante \n\nGago Coutinho\u201d during the 2\nnd\n\n HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man\u2019s Impact \n\nOn European Seas) scientific cruise of the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute. Coccolithophore \n\ncommunities were investigated in 97 water column samples collected at discrete water depth \n\nlevels between 5 and 110 m depth from 25 CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) casts in and \n\naround the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Figure 3.1, Appendix D).  \n\nPhysical oceanographic, biological and chemical data (i.e. temperature, salinity, turbidity, \n\nfluorometry and nutrients) and water column samples were collected using a combined Neil \n\nBrown MKIIIC CTD profiler equipped with an Aquatracka nephelometer, a Seapoint \n\nfluorometer and a rosette sampler (12 Niskin bottles of 8 litres). 192 suspended matter samples \n\nwere collected from surface, intermediate and bottom nepheloid layers in order to define the \n\nparticulate matter concentration (PMC) and to calibrate the nephelometer response (turbidity). \n\nThe PMC (g/m\n3\n) was compared to a laboratory calibration of the instrument with a standard \n\nformazine solution (FTU). The turbidity calibration for March 2010, was FTU = 0.112*PMC \n\nwith r = 0.88. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Meteorological and hydrological data \n\nHydrographic conditions during the cruise as determined from CTD profiles are \n\nrepresented as contour plots using inverse distance to power gridding in Surfer Version 8 \n\nsoftware. A WSW-ENE oriented transect covering the entire length of the upper-middle Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon axis (23 CTD casts) was built to represent density, temperature, salinity and turbidity \n\nconditions during the sampling period (casts indicated in Figure 3.1; CTD profiles in Figures \n\n3.2a-d).

Satellite data \n\nMonthly averaged surface water chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration between 2006 and \n\n2011 was assessed from satellite data as a framework for interpreting spatial and temporal \n\ndistribution of phytoplankton in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. Chl-a data acquired by the Moderate-\n\nresolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Aqua satellite and processed by The \n\nOcean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) were downloaded from the Ocean Color Website \n\n(http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/). After quality checking and masking, valid data were \n\ninterpolated from a grid of regular latitude-longitude intervals. For each image, with nominal \n\nresolution of 1 km, data corresponding to three defined transects (one transect along the canyon, \n\ntwo other crossing it) were extracted and averaged per month.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1\u2013 Geographical location of the study area and investigated CTD casts.

Laboratory and microscope analysis \n\n3.3.4.1. Coccolithophores \n\nFor the study of coccolithophores, seawater samples of around 2 l were filtered over \n\ncellulose acetate filters (47 mm diameter and 0.45 ?m pore size) using a low pressure vacuum \n\nsystem. The filters were then rinsed with tap water to remove salt and oven-dried at 40 \u00baC for 24 \n\nhours. A randomly chosen section (approx. 30\u201345\u00ba) of each filter was cut and permanently \n\nmounted on a glass slide. Coccospheres (cells) were identified and counted under polarized light \n\nmicroscope (PLM) (Olympus BX-40) at 1250\u00d7 magnification. The scanned area per filter varied \n\nbetween 0.1 and 3.5 mm\n2\n, depending on the general cell density. The number of cells per liter of \n\nseawater was estimated from the number of counted coccospheres multiplied with the ratio of \n\nfilled filter area to observed area and divided by the volume of filtered water (Cros, 2001).  \n\nFor the study of the living assemblages (cells) only the water column between 5 and 110 \n\nm water depth was considered. To refine the taxonomic differentiation of Alisphaera spp., \n\nAlgirosphaera robusta, Gephyrocapsa spp., Ophiaster spp., Syracolithus dalmaticus and \n\nSyracosphaera spp., 13 samples were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM \n\nHitachi S-3500N, at 5 kV). Samples were selected for containing relatively higher cell densities \n\nand species diversity. A randomly chosen section of the selected filters was fixed with colloidal \n\nAg on a SEM stub and sputtered with an Au-Pd coating of maximum 20 nm thick; then, a \n\nminimum number of 100 vision fields (VF) were observed and counted using magnifications \n\nbetween 1000\u00d7 (observation area of each VF: 126.52 \u00d7 94.84 ?m) and 2000\u00d7 (observation area \n\nof each VF: 63.26 \u00d7 47.42 \u00b5m).  \n\nIdentification of coccolithophore species followed Jordan et al. (2004) and Young et al. \n\n(2003), whilst the new website on nannoplankton taxonomy http://nannotax.org (Young et al., \n\n2011) and specific literature on light microscopy (Frada et al. 2009), Mediterranean \n\ncoccolithophores (Cros and Fortu\u00f1o 2002) and Syracosphaera genus (Kleijne and Cros, 2009) \n\nprovided useful additional guidance for classification. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.4.2. Phytoplankton pigments (Chl-a) and nutrients  \n\nChl-a concentrations were used as an indicator for phytoplankton biomass. Water samples \n\nof 2 l were filtered over Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 ?m pore size, 25 mm diameter), and the \n\nfilters were immediately deep-frozen and stored at ?80 \u00b0C. Phytoplankton pigments were \n\nextracted with 2-3 ml of 95 % cold-buffered methanol (2 % ammonium acetate) and analysed \n\nwith high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chromatographic separation was \n\ncarried out following Zapata et al. (2000). Chl-a concentrations obtained from 25 HPLC \n\nsamples were then used to calibrate fluorometry measurements obtained from CTD casts (r\n2 \n\n=0.7, with p&lt;0.01). \n\nNutrient concentrations (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate and silicate) were \n\ndetermined using a Skalar SANplus Segmented Flow AutoAnalyzer specially developed for the \n\nhttp://nannotax.org/\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n94 \n\nanalysis of saline waters. N\u2013NOx and N\u2013NO2 were determined according to Strickland and \n\nParsons (1972), with N\u2013NO3 being estimated by the difference between the previous two; N\u2013\n\nNH4 and Si\u2013SiO2 were determined according to Koroleff (1976); P\u2013PO4 was determined \n\naccording to Murphy and Riley (1962). All methods were adapted to the methodology of \n\nsegmented flow analysis and uncertainties were determined following Mendes et al. (2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.5. Statistical analysis \n\nA statistical multivariate analysis (r-mode Factor Analysis by Statistica 10) was \n\nperformed upon the data matrix with coccolithophore cell densities, nutrient concentrations \n\n(NOx, PO4, SiO2), biomass (fluorometry calibrated with Chl-a concentrations measured by \n\nHPLC) and physical parameters (temperature, salinity, turbidity) as columns (variables). Results \n\nfrom the original data matrices were optimized through Varimax Raw rotation. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4. Results  \n\n3.4.1. Environmental conditions during the cruise \n\nThe plankton cruise took place under transient environmental conditions in late winter \n\n2010, as discussed in detail in Guerreiro et al. (2013) (Chapter 2). Sampling was performed at \n\nthe end of an unusually cold winter in Europe (2009\u20132010) under an exceptionally negative \n\nphase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Cattiaux et al., 2010; Troupin and Machin, \n\n2012). Whilst a northerly wind regime began to settle around the start of the cruise, the winter \n\nmixed layer was still occupying most of the water column over the shelf and upper slope \n\n(uppermost ~150\u2013200 m water depth), as normally the case during winter off Portugal (Oliveira \n\net al., 2004). However, intense river runoff that occurred prior to and continued during the \n\ncruise had produced a well-established colder and less saline surface layer extending from near \n\nthe coast to more than 50 km offshore, overlying the warmer and saltier winter mixed layer \n\nwaters (Figures 3.2a,b,c). The lowest TS values within this buoyant plume fed by runoff water \n\nwere measured at the surface, approximately between 16 and 30 km off the coast (stations 79 \n\nand 122, respectively). \n\nThe warmer and saltier winter mixed layer associated with the flow of the IPC along the \n\nPortuguese margin was noticeable below the surface buoyant plume in the entire investigated \n\nregion, generally below 15-20 m water depth, appearing continuous in north-south direction \n\nclose to the shelf-break, at the upper-middle Nazar\u00e9 Canyon transition. Further offshore it was \n\nmostly noticed along the southern flank of the middle canyon but weakening northwards where \n\nsignificant mixing apparently occurred with colder water masses from north. The TS contrast \n\nbetween the superficial BP and the winter mixed layer below was particularly pronounced in the \n\nupper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon where the core of the IPC penetrated up-canyon to less than 10 km off the \n\ncoast. TS profiles along the canyon axis show evidence of strong vertical oscillation around  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Density (a), salinity (b), temperature (c) and turbidity (d) sections \n\nobtained from CTD casts along a WSW-ENE transect representing the \n\nhydrological conditions during the cruise along the upper-middle Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\naxis. Labels refer to stations where plankton samples were collected for \n\ncoccolithophore studies. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n96 \n\nBelatina Valley (station 120) possibly driven by internal tides in this part of the canyon \n\n(Quaresma et al., 2007) (Figures 3.2a,b,c). \n\nTurbidity was generally low, with relatively higher FTU values noticed in the surficial \n\nwater layer, as well as at the bottom layer of the upper canyon (i.e. in the canyon head and close \n\nto the intersection with Vit\u00f3ria tributary). Highest turbidity values recorded around 200\u2013300 m \n\nwater depth appear to reflect bottom sediment resuspension caused by the canyon\u2019s internal tide \n\n(Figure 3.2d). \n\nHighest nutrient concentrations were recorded in the relatively cool and low-saline \n\nsurface water of the BP, decreasing to lower concentrations in the winter mixed layer water \n\nunderneath. The vertical decreasing trend was particularly noticeable in the case of SiO2 (Figure \n\n3.3). NOx/PO4 ratio was generally close to the 16:1 Redfield Ratio typical for marine waters \n\n(Redfield et al., 1963). A slight deviation toward lower NOx concentrations relative to PO4 in \n\nmost samples suggests that NOx was the major limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth at \n\nthat time.  \n\nPhytoplankton biomass inferred from Chl-a concentrations (max.&lt;0.7 \u00b5g/l) was \n\ngenerally low during the cruise, with the highest values reached at the uppermost part of the \n\nwater column (above 50 m depth) (Figure 3.4). Highest Chl-a and nutrient concentrations (NOx \n\nand SiO2) and the lowest salinities were measured at the surface (5 m) near Belatina Valley \n\n(stations 118 and 120) and north of the upper canyon (stations 112 and 111).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Relationship between nutrient concentration and salinity during the cruise.

Species diversity, cell density and distribution \n\nA total of 35 distinct taxa of coccolithophores (coccospheres) were recognized. 19 species \n\nand 4 genera were identified using polarizing light microscopy (PLM) whereas additional \n\nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis revealed an additional 16 species belonging to \n\nthe genera Syracosphaera, Ophiaster, Alisphaera and Acanthoica, and one holococcolithophore, \n\nSyracolithus dalmaticus (see Table 3.1). The list of observed species is presented in Appendix \n\nA.  \n\nCoccolithophore cells occurred within the BP and the upper layers of the winter mixed \n\nlayer as indicated in Figure 3.5. Total cell densities ranged between 4.0\u00d710\n3\n and 6.0\u00d710\n\n5\n cells/l \n\n(Table 3.1). The highest cell densities along a transect covering the upper-middle Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon axis were noticed close to Belatina Valley, associated to minimum TS values within the \n\nBP (stations 118 and 120) (Figure 3.6). High cell densities were also noticed closer to the coast, \n\nat the canyon\u2019s head (station 87), less than 2 km off the coast, and above the southern canyon \n\nrim (station 89) (Figure 3.7a). Further offshore toward the open ocean (station 132) lower cell \n\ndensities were observed, distributed more homogeneously over the water column (Figure 3.7b-\n\nc).  \n\nOf the 35 identified taxa, only ten reached significant cell densities of more than 2000 \n\ncoccospheres per litre: Emiliania huxleyi, Syracosphaera spp., Gephyrocapsa ericsonii, G. \n\noceanica, G. muellerae, Coronosphaera mediterranea, Ophiaster spp., Helicosphaera carteri, \n\nSyracolithus dalmaticus and Algirosphaera robusta. E. huxleyi was the dominant species during \n\nthe cruise, particularly at the surface close to the shelf-coastal region (Figure 3.8, Table 3.1). \n\nBelow the surface and further offshore, other species gained in relative importance within the \n\ntotal assemblage, generally displaying a broader vertical distribution (Figure 3.9; Guerreiro al., \n\n2013) (Chapter 2). G. ericsonii, A. robusta, Acanthoica spp., Syracosphaera pulchra, S.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 - Coccolithophore cell densities (cells/l) observed during the cruise plotted over a TS diagram. \n\nSolid lines refer to CTD profiles from selected stations to illustrate the surface mixed layer and the \n\nENACWst as defined by Fi\u00faza (1984) and Fi\u00faza et al. (1998): stations 87, 118 and 132 located at 225 m, \n\n854 m and 3478 m water depths, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\ndalmaticus, Coccolithus pelagicus, Michaelsarsia elegans and, to a lesser extent G. oceanica, \n\ndisplayed a downward decreasing trend in cell density, similar to that of E. huxleyi. Other \n\ngroups of species such as Syracosphaera spp, Ophiaster spp. and Gephyrocapsa muellerae \n\nrevealed a more uniform vertical distribution. The remaining taxa did not reveal a specific \n\nvertical distribution pattern (Figure 3.8). \n\nA coast to open ocean ecological and hydrological dichotomy is well illustrated in Figure \n\n3.9: E. huxleyi dominated at the surface in coastal waters (stations 87 and 120, Figures 3.9c,b), \n\nwhereas Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. were dominant further offshore in more open-\n\nocean conditions, and showing a broader vertical distribution (station 132, Figure 3.9a). Closer \n\nto Belatina Valley, the three taxa co-existed, with E. huxleyi largely dominating at the surface, \n\nand the latter taxa relatively increasing in the subsurface water mass (Figure 3.9b). G. \n\nmuellerae, G. oceanica and S. dalmaticus were also more abundant near the coast, whereas G. \n\nericsonii and C. mediterranea revealed a broader lateral distribution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nInfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Maximum cell densities (cells/l) of the coccolithophore species observed under PLM during \n\nthe sampling period.

Multivariate analysis \n\nResults from factor analysis revealed four distinct factor assemblages explaining 46 % of \n\nthe total variance in the data (Table 3.2, Figure 3.10). Factor 1 (F1) explains 22 % of total \n\nvariability, with NOx, SiO2, Acan and Eh recording the highest (positive) factor loadings, in \n\nopposition to S, T (and Syraco and Ophi) (negative loadings). Factor 2 (F2) explains 10 % of \n\ntotal variance, being represented by Ge, Biom and Cm (and Eh) (positive loadings). Factor 3 \n\n(F3) explains 8 % of total variability and is represented by Dtub, Alisph (and PO4) (negative \n\nloadings). Factor 4 (F4) explains 7 % of total variability and it is represented by Go (and Turb) \n\n(positive loadings) in opposition to Meleg (negative loadings).  \n\nSamples influenced by factor assemblage NOx, SiO2, Acanthoica spp. and E. huxleyi (F1 \n\npositive scores) were better represented at the surface, particularly close to Belatina Valley \n\n(stations 118 and 120) but also around the uppermost reaches of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (stations \n\n112, 111, 102) and the canyon head (stations 85, 87) (Figure 3.10a). Below the surface this \n\nassemblage was practically inexistent or weakly represented.

In the intersection between the canyon axis and Vit\u00f3ria \n\ntributary (station 80) and at Belatina Valley, this assemblage was well represented at the \n\nuppermost 25 m (Figure 3.10d).  \n\nThe relatively low percentage of variance explained by F1-F4 (&lt;50%) reflects the highly \n\ntransient meteorological and hydrological conditions during the cruise, where water masses \n\n(both oceanic and continental) were still adjusting to the circulation imposed by the shifting \n\nwind regime (see Guerreiro et al., 2013). Nevertheless, factor analysis helped to reveal and \n\nunderstand the most important ecological signals during the cruise:   \n\n(a) coccolithophore cell density and diversity \u201chotspot\u201d at the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head, \n\ndespite of abundant detritic material (i.e. terrigenous particles, reworked coccoliths). Significant \n\namounts of perfectly preserved cells, particularly of E. huxleyi, together with several other \n\nspecies, testify of the high diversity found in this part of the canyon (see Appendix B). \n\nGephyrocapsa muellerae, Syracolithus dalmaticus, Acanthoica spp. and Michaelsarsia elegans \n\nhad their maxima in this area (Table 3.1). Additional SEM observations confirmed the relative \n\nincrease of Calcidiscus leptoporus, Coccolithus pelagicus and Helicosphaera carteri in the \n\ncanyon head, together with the single occurrence of Syracosphaera amoena (formerly S. \n\nbannockii, see Dimiza et al 2008), Syracosphaera molischii, Palusphaera vandelii and \n\nSyracosphaera anthos.

Monthly averaged Chl-a from satellite imagery \n\nTime-series of monthly averaged Chl-a between 2006 and 2011 calculated from satellite \n\ndata are shown for three transects: transect A, WSW\u2013ENE oriented, covering the whole upper-\n\nmiddle canyon axis (Figure 3.11a); transect B, N\u2013S oriented, cutting across the canyon axis at \n\nBelatina Valley (station 120) (Figure 3.11b); and transect C oriented at a low angle to the \n\ncoastline and cutting across the canyon head (station 87). \n\nThe along-canyon time series (Figure 3.11a) illustrates the recurrent maximum of Chl-a \n\nin offshore waters occurring around March and April of all years, and a more persistent \n\npresence of high Chl-a concentrations in the coastal zone during spring and summer months. \n\nThere is no evidence of persistent or particularly high Chl-a at Belatina Valley, although the \n\ntransition zone between Chl-a enriched waters extending from the coast and Chl-a poorer \n\noffshore waters is often located approximately in this region. A map of average Chl-a \n\nconcentration for March 2010 (see Figure B in Auxiliary Material, Chapter 2) illustrates the \n\nbroad spatial spread of this Chl-a enrichment, occupying a significant portion of the continental \n\nshelf and extending approximately up to the middle shelf region, apparently coming from north. \n\nSlightly higher Chl-a concentrations are noticed along the canyon axis in comparison to the \n\nshelf immediately north of it, particularly at Belatina Valley, where the highest coccolithophore \n\ncell densities and Chl-a were recorded in situ during the cruise. Similar offshore outbreaks of \n\nChl-a enrichment were also observed in March 2006 and 2009, extending almost to the shelf-\n\nbreak in 2006, and even beyond in 2009 (data not shown).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 \u2013 Monthly averaged Chl-a \n\nproduction in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon region \n\nduring 2006-2011, obtained from \n\nsatellite data: (a) along-canyon oriented \n\nTransect A, between 39.59N, -9.1W \n\nand 39.51N, -9.9W; (b) north-south \n\noriented Transect B crossing the canyon \n\nat station 120, between 39.85N, -9.41W \n\nand 39.2N, -9.41W; and (c) NNE-SSW \n\noriented Transect C crossing the canyon \n\nat station 87, between 39.85N, -9.1W \n\nand 39.4N, -9.41W.

The time series for the NNE-SSW near-shore \n\ntransect cutting across the canyon head (Figure 3.11c) shows maximum Chl-a concentrations in \n\nthe canyon head and immediate vicinity in these time-intervals, exceeding concentrations on the \n\nsurrounding shelf. The timing of Chl-a peaks in the canyon head, between mid-August and mid-\n\nSeptember 2007; between mid-May and mid-June 2009; in March and between mid-June and \n\nmid-August 2010, is conspicuously different from that of the widespread Chl-a enrichment in \n\nearly spring extending across the shelf.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5. Discussion \n\n3.5.1. Late winter coccolithophore assemblages off Portugal \n\nModerately low coccolithophore cell densities (between 3.6\u00d710\n3\n and 6\u00d710\n\n5\n cells/l) and \n\nlow phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) (max.&lt;0.7 \u00b5g/l) were observed during the sampling period, \n\nwhich is in good agreement with observations by Moita (2001) and Silva et al. (2009) regarding \n\nwintertime phytoplankton production off Portugal. The lack of a clear correlation between Chl-a \n\nand nutrients (Figure 3.4) suggests that phytoplankton production was generally low and not \n\nlimited by nutrient availability within the BP. In comparison, previous studies reporting a much \n\nstronger relationship with nutrient concentration attributed a decisive role to haline-stratification \n\nin promoting phytoplankton blooms during late winter upwelling events off Portugal (Peliz and \n\nFi\u00faza, 1999; Ribeiro et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2004). The subdued phytoplankton growth here \n\nobserved is interpreted as resulting from important advective mixing promoted by the BP during \n\nthis period of intense runoff, sub-optimal light conditions due to cloud cover and initial \n\nrelatively high turbidity within the superficial BP (discussed in Guerreiro et al., 2013) (Chapter \n\n2). \n\nFour distinct ecological signatures (factors) were extracted from multivariate statistical \n\nanalysis applied to the present dataset, explaining 46 % of the variability within the data and \n\nrevealing the most important environmental and ecological signals during the cruise (Figure \n\n3.10, Table 3.2).  \n\nFactor 1 (positive loadings) is interpreted as representing the gradient between the runoff-\n\ninfluenced coastal-neritic zone, where relatively high nutrient concentrations were retained in \n\nthe superficial BP, and the oceanic mixed water that characterizes the Portuguese margin during \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n112 \n\nwinter, present below the BP closer to the coast and surfacing further offshore. Acanthoica spp. \n\nand Emiliania huxleyi appear positively correlated with nutrients at the surface within more \n\ncoastal-neritic conditions. F1 was strongly expressed close to Belatina Valley and around the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon head and surroundings, but nearly absent below the surface, highlighting the \n\nstrong vertical density gradient of the BP and the clear preference of these taxa to develop at the \n\nsunlit nutrient-rich surface water layer (Figure 3.9b,c and 3.10a).  \n\nThe large dominance of E. huxleyi at the less saline sunlit surface layer and its preference \n\nfor more coastal/neritic conditions is in good agreement with several authors describing this \n\nspecies as having a highly cosmopolitan distribution independent of sea surface temperature, \n\nand attaining high cell densities in both oligotrophic and eutrophic environments (Andruleit, \n\n2007; Baumann et al., 2000; Winter et al., 1994). This species was considered to be a possible \n\nindicator for more stable regions regarding with nutrient availability (Andruleit and Rogalla, \n\n2002), and is often found associated with nutrient-rich and productive coastal regions (e.g. \n\nAndruleit, 2007; Giraudeau and Bailey, 1995; Sprengel et al., 2002; Silva et al., 2008). From \n\nvarious locations it has been reported as responsible for major blooms (e.g. Garcia et al., 2011; \n\nKnappertsbush and Brummer, 1995).  \n\nE. huxleyi was also weakly positively correlated to Gephyrocapsa ericsonii, \n\nCoronosphaera mediterranea and Chl-a in Factor 2 (positive loadings), particularly in what \n\nrevealed to be the most productive station monitored during the cruise, located around Belatina \n\nValley (Figure 3.10b). Further offshore where E. huxleyi was not dominating the \n\ncoccolithophore community, the two taxa were also important. G. ericsonii was the second most \n\nabundant species during the cruise, next to E. huxleyi, which is in good agreement with several \n\nstudies indicating its preference for nutrient-enriched coastal-neritic regions (Giraudeau and \n\nBailey, 1995; Silva et al., 2009; Winter et al., 1979). C. mediterranea was also significantly \n\npresent during the cruise, supporting previous observations reporting high cell densities of this \n\nspecies off the Nazar\u00e9 region (Moita et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2008), and fast response to \n\nnutrient availability in this area during winter (Guerreiro et al., 2013) (Chapter 2).  \n\nOn the contrary, Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. (negative loadings of Factor 1) \n\nshowed a higher affinity for warmer and saltier open ocean waters, and these species appeared \n\nmore broadly distributed along the water column (Figures 3.9a and 3.10a). Closer to the coast, \n\nthese species were generally less frequent, although higher cell densities were observed below \n\nthe surface, where they were apparently able to compete with E. huxleyi. This suggests that the \n\nlower light and nutrient level within neritic subsurface waters were less limiting for these taxa \n\nthan for E. huxleyi. Results are consistent with Andruleit (2007) in terms of the broad depth \n\nrange of Syracosphaera spp. but not concerning the affinity of this group for nutrient \n\navailability in coastal regions as reported in earlier studies (e.g. Andruleit, 2007; Andruleit and \n\nRogalla, 2002; Giraudeau and Bailey, 1995). Whereas SEM observations indicated that \n\nSyracosphaera marginoporata was the dominant species within the group (max.1.4\u00d710\n5\n cells/l), \n\nthe low level of taxonomical differentiation of Syracosphaera spp. from the above mentioned \n\nstudies  may explain the discrepancy between its reportedly association with relatively eutrophic \n\nconditions and its preferential distribution in the relatively oligotrophic oceanic waters of the \n\n\n\nInfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n \n113 \n\n \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon region. \n\nThe same applies to Ophiaster spp. of which little is known yet in terms of both \n\necological preferences and biogeographic distribution. Whereas our late winter observations \n\nseem to indicate an association of this genus with oceanic-oligotrophic conditions, other studies \n\ndescribe it as associated to nutrient-rich environments such as subtropical frontal zones and \n\nupwelling areas (e.g. Boeckel and Baumann, 2008; Kleijne, 1993). \n\nDiscosphaera tubifera and Alisphaera spp. were not abundant during the cruise (<2000 \n\ncells/l), and found weakly correlated to PO4 (negative loadings of Factor 3), very close to the \n\ncoast at the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head (station 87, 50 m water depth) (Figure 3.10c). In the recent \n\nliterature, D. tubifera is typically associated with subtropical gyres (Boeckel and Baumann, \n\n2008) and oligotrophic waters, always outside the upwelling area (e.g. Andruleit et al., 2003; \n\nKleijne, 1992). Ecological preferences of Alisphaera spp. are still poorly known, whereas \n\nKleijne (1993) found it associated with G. oceanica in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and \n\nSourthern Red Sea, both increasing towards the central upwelling zone. In addition to these \n\ntaxa, the sporadic occurrence of other species of subtropical affinity in the upper Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon, i.e. Rhabdosphaera clavigera, Palusphaera vandelii, Umbellosphaera irregularis, \n\nScyphosphaera apsteinii and Umbilicosphaera hulburtiana, and the local relative increase of \n\nspecies that exhibited an oceanic affinity during the cruise, i.e. Calcidiscus leptoporus, \n\nCoccolithus pelagicus, Syracosphaera amoena, and Syracosphaera molischii were also noticed. \n\nThe relatively oligotrophic signature of coccolithophore assemblages observed in subsurface \n\nwaters along the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis seems in favour of the hypothesis that the canyon acts as a \n\npreferential pathway for advection of oceanic waters derived from ENACWst from offshore \n\nonto more nearshore areas during winter (see section 3.5.2).  \n\nGephyrocapsa oceanica appears to be related to turbidity, although the correlation is \n\nsomewhat weak (positive loadings of Factor 4). This species was consistently distributed closer \n\nto the coast (&lt;10 km) at all water depths, particularly at the canyon head and adjacent shelf \n\n(Figure 3.10d). The broad depth range of G. oceanica was also recognized by Andruleit (2007) \n\nand Houghton and Guptha (1991), as well as its tolerance for lithogenic particles, which would \n\nbe in accordance with the occurrence of G. oceanica in the dynamic canyon head area; water \n\nsamples collected from this area displayed a highly content in terrigenous particles and \n\nreworked coccoliths; see Appendix B, Figures 45 and 46). The coastal preference of G. \n\noceanica is also in good agreement with Silva et al. (2008) and Guerreiro et al. (2013; \n\nsubmitted-b) (Chapters 2 and 4), who described this species as a typical coastal coccolithophore, \n\nwell adapted to the nutrient-rich and productive environment off Portugal. The species seems \n\nable to quickly respond to nutrient input (Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Andruleit et al., 2003; \n\nBroerse et al., 2000; Giraudeau and Bailey, 1995; Sprengel et al., 2002; Winter et al., 1994). \n\nThe relatively low cell densities of this species confirm the generally low-productive conditions \n\nduring the cruise. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n114 \n\n3.5.2. Influence of the submarine canyon and hydrological conditions \n\nAlthough phytoplankton production apparently had not yet responded to higher nutrient \n\navailability provided by runoff, as revealed by generally low coccolithophore cell and Chl-a \n\nconcentrations (see section 2.5.1 in Chapter 2, Guerreiro et al., 2013), local abundance and \n\ndiversity \u201chotspots\u201d were noticed in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis close to Belatina Valley \n\n(stations 120 and 118) and in the canyon head (station 87).  \n\nOf particular interest for the canyon head dynamics are the sporadic occurrences of \n\ntypical subtropical-oligotrophic species, such as Discosphaera tubifera and Palusphaera \n\nvandelii. These species were only observed in this proximal part of the canyon and may be \n\ninterpreted as tracers for the preferential onflow of ENACWst through the upper canyon during \n\nwinter, as revealed by TS profiles along the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis (Figures 3.2a,b). Shoreward \n\ndeflection of circulation in the upper water column is expected to be stronger when the water \n\ncolumn above the shelf and upper slope is relatively unstratified (see Allen, 1996; She and \n\nKlinck, 2000), as typically the case off Portugal during this time of the year (Oliveira et al., \n\n2004).  \n\nAlong with these subtropical species, a diverse assemblage dominated by the productive \n\nEmiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Coronosphaera mediterranea was observed in \n\nthe canyon head. Maxima of other species, both neritic-coastal (i.e. Gephyrocapsa oceanica, \n\nAcanthoica spp.) and neritic-oceanic (i.e. Gephyrocapsa muellerae, Syracolithus dalmaticus and \n\nAlisphaera spp.) were also observed in this area. Whereas during the low productive winter \n\nseason the shoreward advection of oceanic waters through the canyon can be traced by \n\nrelatively diverse coccolithophore assemblages with oligotrophic subtropical affinity, satellite \n\ndata clearly show a maximum in Chl-a concentration at the canyon head between March and \n\nOctober suggesting that upwelling of oceanic waters in the canyon head enhances \n\nphytoplankton productivity making the canyon head the most persistently productive part of the \n\ninner shelf zone (Figures 3.11a,c). Also during the years of lower productivity a relative \n\nincrease of Chl-a is noticed at the canyon head. Previous observations from Mendes et al. \n\n(2011) had already indicated that the highest Chl-a concentrations during an upwelling event \n\noccurred at the canyon head (> 4 ?g/l).  \n\nEnhanced Chl-a concentrations observed in satellite imagery south of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\nand close to Cape Carvoeiro supports previous observations of Mendes et al. (2011) of \n\npersistently high concentrations of diatoms in this area, interpreted as reflecting the occurrence \n\nof intensified upwelling along the southern canyon rim extending its influence over the southern \n\nshelf, and persisting even during relaxation of upwelling-favourable winds. Enhancement of \n\nupwelling in the canyon head and nearby shelf is in accordance with studies of Bosley et al. \n\n(2004), Hickey (1995) and Skliris and Djenidi (2006). However, the recurrent generation of \n\nupwelling filaments off Cape Carvoeiro during spring-summer should also be considered when \n\nexplaining high production of phytoplankton in this area (e.g. Fi\u00faza, 1983; Haynes et al., 1993; \n\nPeliz et al., 2002). \n\nThe region close to Belatina Valley, where the upper canyon axis makes a tight turn \n\n\n\nInfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n \n115 \n\n \n\n(stations 120 and 118), also stood out for particular hydrological and ecological characteristics. \n\nThe highest phytoplankton biomass and coccolithophore cell densities during the cruise were \n\nobserved in this area, with E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii and C. mediterranea dominating the \n\nassemblage in the uppermost 25 m of the water column. The lowest TS values and the highest \n\nnutrient concentrations within the superficial BP were also measured here, whereas indications \n\nof enhanced vertical baroclinic oscillation were noticed underneath the BP (Figures 3.2a,b), \n\ninterpreted as resulting from the interaction of internal waves with the canyon topography. The \n\nconversion of barotropic to baroclinic tidal motion occurs in the presence of water stratification \n\nand leads to the generation of internal (baroclinic) tides (i.e. internal waves of tidal period), \n\nwhich radiate from the generation point and propagate the tidal energy vertically (Quaresma et \n\nal., 2007; Tyler et al., 2009). The vertical density gradient existing between the BP (above) and \n\nthe ENACWst (below) within the confined topography of the upper canyon will likely promote \n\nthe baroclinic oscillation of the water masses involved. In addition, the presence of a meander in \n\nthis part of the canyon axis appears to block the flow of the internal wave, leading to local \n\namplification of the vertical oscillation. One could speculate that this represents a typical \n\nhydrological feature of the canyon during wintertime, given that it is during this time of the year \n\nthat the IPC usually surfaces and reaches particularly nearshore areas within the canyon. During \n\nsummer, when the IPC retreats down to slope water depths, baroclinic activity near the surface \n\nis mainly associated to water column thermo-haline stratification typical of this season (e.g. \n\nQuaresma et al., 2007). \n\nThe highest cell and Chl-a concentrations measured in situ close to Belatina Valley may \n\nbe interpreted to merely represent a local expression of shelf-wide high phytoplankton \n\nproduction recurrently occurring during the month of March (Figures 3.11a and Figure B in \n\nAuxiliary Material, Chapter 2). Although slightly higher monthly Chl-a concentrations appear to \n\nbe roughly aligned with the canyon axis in comparison to the northern shelf, in particular close \n\nto the meander (Figure B-b in Auxiliary Material, Chapter 2), it is very hard to decipher whether \n\nthis reflects a recurrent physical phenomenon related to the canyon or merely an artefact \n\nproduced by the satellite acquisition. Given that the regional Chl-a outbreak observed in satellite \n\nimagery consistently occurs in late winter/early spring of most years, occasionally also in early \n\nautumn, but never in full winter or full summer time, it is likely representing the early spring \n\nand autumn phytoplankton bloom, controlled primarily by the increase in light availability in \n\nspring and replenishment of nutrients in autumn. The more intense offshore blooms recorded in \n\nMarch of 2006, 2009 and 2010 may result from late-winter and early-spring runoff in \n\ncombination with short-term northerly winds over the shelf, a condition described by several \n\nauthors (i.e. Guerreiro et al., 2013; Peliz and Fi\u00faza., 1999; Ribeiro et al., 2005; Santos et al., \n\n2004; Chapter 2). \n\nIn situ measurements indicating enhanced productivity in the surroundings of Belatina \n\nValley should, therefore, primarily reveal the presence of a front generated between the BP and \n\nthe shelf-slope waters during a hydrologically and meteorologically highly transient period in \n\nthis region (Guerreiro et al., 2013 \u2013 Chapter 2). Nevertheless, in view of the particular location, \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n116 \n\nother phenomena could be invoked to explain the local phytoplankton increase, which may be \n\ntoo short-lived and localized to be identified within monthly averaged Chl-a distribution maps. \n\nAs suggested above, the abrupt seabed topography of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon is likely to \n\ninduce perturbations in the flow of water masses on the shelf. Fronts between relatively \n\nproductive coastal water masses and less-productive open ocean water masses will tend to \n\nmeander across the canyon, adding complexity to spatial distribution of particulate matter in the \n\nsurface water. Since the sampling cruise took place during the winter-spring transition when the \n\nwater masses were still adjusting, the canyon topography might be expected to have a noticable \n\ninfluence on the circulation. In contrast, during typical summer-conditions, wind forcing will \n\nplay a more prominent role in determining surface water circulation.  \n\nBelatina Valley appears to be a region of significant topographic effect on the front of the \n\nlow salinity BP, as indicated by the occurrence of the strongest vertical density gradients in this \n\narea. Quaresma (2012) reported on the existence of a barotropic water mass flux of convergent-\n\ndivergent periodic motion between the interior of the canyon and the shelf close to Belatina \n\nValley, driven by the barotropic onshore-offshore water flow. According to this author, the \n\ncanyon axis acts as drain for shelf water at this location during every low tide. This water \n\nexchange may result in the concentration of nutrients within the surface water layer, whose \n\ntime-integrated effect would result in a local nutrient-enrichment favorable for phytoplankton \n\ngrowth. Several modeling studies revealed the importance of ocean currents interacting with \n\nsubmarine canyons, enhancing productivity and influencing phytoplankton distribution by \n\nfunneling and trapping plankton within the canyons. These studies highlight the predominant \n\neffect of local primary production on the canyon food web, in comparison to other potential \n\nsources (Bosley et al., 2004; Macquart-Moulin and Patriti, 1996; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). \n\nIn addition, one could speculate that internal tidal pumping driven by intensified vertical \n\nbaroclinic oscillation around Belatina Valley could contribute to phytoplankton growth in this \n\narea, similar to what has recently been described from Monterey Canyon (California, USA) by \n\nRyan et al. ( 2005; 2010). These authors described the upsurge of a wedge-shaped tongue of \n\ncold, dense water from the canyon, flowing up onto the continental shelf. The intruding water \n\nmass was observed to entrain a plume of nutrient-rich turbid water from the seafloor up to the \n\nsurface, above which high concentrations of phytoplankton were observed. In the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon, during a cruise performed in November 2002, a vertical turbid plume was observed at \n\nthe Belatina Valley area, extending upward from a level of intense intermediate nepheloid layers \n\nat 800-900 m water depths to about 300 m. This plume was interpreted as reflecting \n\nresuspension by the canyon\u2019s internal tide, enhanced by the strong density gradient between the \n\nENACW (above) and the denser Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) (below) (Oliveira et al., \n\n2007). Such baroclinic vertical oscillation, amplified in the canyon meander, may be responsible \n\nfor bringing nutrients from below the canyon rim during winter, promoting phytoplankton \n\ngrowth in the upper part of the water column. However, our water column turbidity profiles and \n\nvertical distribution of coccolithophores and nutrients show no evidence of the occurrence of \n\nthis process during the investigated late winter period, where enhanced nutrient concentrations \n\nappeared predominantly associated with the BP (see Guerreiro et al., 2013). Baroclinic activity \n\n\n\nInfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n \n117 \n\n \n\nis more likely to gain in importance during stratified summer conditions. \n\n \n\n3.5.3. Satellite data versus in situ measurements \n\nOur observations, both long-term Chl-a concentrations obtained from satellite data and in \n\nsitu quantification, suggest that the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon may locally favor, at least indirectly, the \n\ndevelopment of phytoplankton, including coccolithophores. This is the case for the canyon \n\nhead, which appears to be the stage of recurrent higher productivity in comparison to the \n\nadjacent shelf. However, in the case of Belatina Valley, where in situ observations revealed \n\nlocal Chl-a and coccolithophore cell enhancement, monthly averaged productivity obtained \n\nfrom satellite suggest that enhanced Chl-a production was not confined to that specific area but \n\noccurred over a much wider area including most of the shelf (transect B, Figure 11b).  \n\nOn the one hand, lacking in situ observations from outside the canyon, we cannot \n\nascertain whether higher Chl-a and cell densities obtained from this area are actually confined to \n\nthe canyon axis, or are part of a larger pattern not necessarily related to the canyon. On the other \n\nhand, it cannot be expected that monthly Chl-a averages obtained from satellite data will match \n\nexactly the coccolithophore and Chl-a peaks measured in situ and only representing one instant \n\nof the annual productivity. Different spatial and temporal scales are involved: whereas the \n\nsatellite data reveal patterns of phytoplankton distribution at the surface at relatively high \n\nresolution, insight of phytoplankton productivity at deeper levels in the water column can only \n\nbe obtained from in situ measurements. Differences between the two will expectedly be largest \n\nunder the highly transient meteorological and oceanographic conditions characteristic of the late \n\nwinter period, as prevailing during the cruise.  \n\nIntensified baroclinic activity at Belatina Valley might well promote biological \n\nproduction events that are too deep and short-lived to be detected by monthly Chl-a averages \n\nobtained by satellite. The rapid response of certain species of coccolithophores to regional \n\nmeteorological and hydrological variations off central Portugal was recently demonstrated by \n\nGuerreiro et al. (2013) (Chapter 2). Satellite imagery has a tremendous potential to describe \n\nlarger-scale phenomena prevailing on the Portuguese margin, but it may not be the best \n\napproach to investigate smaller-scale processes, for which higher temporal and spatial resolution \n\nare probably required.  \n\nValidation of hypotheses presented here requires additional sampling surveys integrated \n\nwith meteorological and hydrological monitoring in order to address the seasonal and \n\ninterannual variability of phytoplankton (in general) and coccolithophores (in particular), in \n\nrelation with physical processes in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n118 \n\n3.6. Conclusions  \n\nThis study is the first attempt to characterize coccolithophore assemblages occurring in \n\nthe context of an active submarine canyon. A late winter low-productive period was investigated \n\nin the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (off central Portugal) during which warm and saline waters fed by the IPC \n\nwere still strongly influencing the hydrology of the shelf and slope, and the winter mixed layer \n\noccupied the entire water column of the shelf-upper slope. The canyon was clearly acting as a \n\nconduit for the onshore advection of relatively nutrient-poor oceanic waters to very nearshore \n\nareas (less than 10 km off the coast).  \n\nRunoff prior and during the cruise was an important source of nutrients into the system, \n\nas indicated by high nutrient concentrations that were measured in the relatively low saline \n\nbuoyant plume overlying the winter mixed layer in the coastal zone. Nevertheless, the weak \n\ncorrelation of nutrients with biomass suggests that phytoplankton production had not yet \n\nresponded to higher nutrient availability, probably resulting from important advective mixing \n\npromoted by the BP during this period of intense runoff, sub-optimal light conditions due to \n\ncloud cover and initial relatively high suspended sediment load within the surface water layer \n\n(discussed in Guerreiro et al., 2013 \u2013 Chapter 2). \n\nTwo main coccolithophore assemblages were distinguished, representing the gradient \n\nbetween the runoff-influenced coastal-neritic zone and the oceanic mixed water conditions that \n\ncharacterize the Portuguese margin during winter: (1) Emiliania huxleyi was the dominant taxon \n\nat the surface within more coastal-neritic conditions and, together with Gephyrocapsa ericsonii \n\nand Coronosphaera mediterranea, represent the more productive assemblage during the \n\nsampling period. (2) Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. showed a clearly higher affinity for \n\nopen-ocean conditions, displaying a generally broader vertical distribution. Closer to the coast, \n\nthese taxa were able to compete well with E. huxleyi in the subsurface layer, suggesting that \n\nlower light and nutrient level within more neritic conditions were less limiting for \n\nSyracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. as it was for E. huxleyi. \n\nChl-a time series obtained from satellite data suggest that the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head is \n\noften the stage of high productivity between March and October, which makes the canyon head \n\nthe most persistently productive part of the upper-middle canyon. In situ observations also \n\nrevealed a coccolithophore diversity \u201chotspot\u201d in this area, including both oligotrophic-oceanic \n\nand opportunistic-coastal taxa. The single occurrence of typically subtropical-oligotrophic \n\nspecies (i.e. Discosphaera tubifera, Palusphaera vandelii, Calcidiscus leptoporus) is interpreted \n\nas indicative for the shoreward flow of ENACWst intensified along the upper canyon during \n\nwinter. In addition to these species, a diversified assemblage dominated by the productive E. \n\nhuxleyi, G. ericsonii and C. mediterranea, together with other species which have their \n\nmaximum occurrence in the canyon head area including both neritic/coastal (i.e. Gephyrocapsa \n\noceanica, Acanthoica spp.) and neritic/oceanic species (i.e. Gephyrocapsa muellerae, \n\nSyracolithus dalmaticus, Alisphaera spp. and Michaelsarsia elegans) may also reflect exchange \n\nof water masses between neritic-coastal and oceanic regions through the canyon during winter. \n\nLocal enhancement of nutrient concentration and coccolithophore cell concentration was \n\n\n\nInfluence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\n \n119 \n\n \n\nobserved near the Belatina Valley, with E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii and C. mediterranea dominating \n\nthe assemblage at the uppermost 25 m of the water column. In addition, monthly averaged \n\nsatellite data reveal slightly higher Chl-a concentrations apparently roughly aligned with the \n\ncanyon axis, close to Belatina Valley. We hypothesize that this imprint may be tracing the time-\n\nintegrated effect of barotropic water mass flux into Belatina Valley and the meandering of the \n\nlow-salinity front into this location. Based on our in situ observations and on recent studies \n\nidentifying this narrower part of the canyon axis as an area of intensified vertical water \n\nmovement, we suggest that Belatina Valley may potentially be a favourable region for \n\nphytoplankton local enhancement.   \n\nResults presented here provide some valuable indications with regards to the important \n\nand persistet influence of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon on the ecology and distribution of \n\ncoccolithophores and phytoplankton biomass at the central Portuguese margin. The results \n\nhighlight the need of long-term multi-proxy investigations in order to address the seasonal and \n\ninterannual variability in phytoplankton in relation with the seasonal- and/or topographically \n\ndriven physical phenomena associated with the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements - This research was supported by the HERMIONE project (EC contract 226354) \n\nfunded by the European Commission and the Cd Tox-CoN project (FCT-PTDC/MAR/102800/2008) \n\nfunded by the Portuguese Science Foundation FCT.

Rodrigues.  \n\nIn revision, Marine Micropaleontology  \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nIn this study we describe recent coccolith assemblages from surface sediments of the \n\ncentral Portuguese continental margin. Assemblages from the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nsubmarine canyons are compared with those from adjacent shelf and slope regions. By \n\ninvestigating North-South and onshore-offshore trends in coccolith concentrations and species \n\npercentages, and by correlation with sediment characteristics (sediment bulk composition and \n\nparticle-size, Corg/Ntot and sediment accumulation rate), (paleo)ecological information can be \n\ndistinguished from taphonomical effects (dissolution, lateral transport and dilution with \n\nterrigenous material). Multivariate analysis was used to statistically reveal and summarize the \n\nmost important signals preserved on the sedimentary record. \n\nCoronosphaera mediterranea, Helicosphaera carteri and Gephyrocapsa oceanica \n\ndisplayed a markedly coastal distribution, revealing to be good (paleo)ecological proxies for \n\nenhanced productivity in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and Estremadura spur, whereas Calcidiscus \n\nleptoporus and the taxonomic group composed by Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera \n\nirregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. appeared to be a good proxy for production occurring \n\nfurther offshore and for onflow of ENACWst towards the southern part of the Portuguese shelf. \n\nIncrease of Gephyrocapsa muellerae in the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon may be \n\ntracing the preferential onflow of oceanic temperate water masses (ENACWsp) through the \n\ncanyon toward coastal regions, and/or indicating up-canyon transport of resuspended coccoliths \n\nin the benthic boundary layer. \n\nThe mix of coccoliths from both coastal-neritic and oceanic species in the canyons appear \n\nto reflect their capacity to promote the exchange of water masses between more coastal and \n\noceanic regions, in comparison to the adjacent shelf and slope regions, as well as the role of \n\ninternal tides in disturbing and homogenizing the sedimentary record. Sediments from the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon are clearly enriched in coccoliths from coastal-neritic species, suggesting a \n\nmore dynamical and nutrient-rich environment favourable for r-selected species to develop, \n\nalthough some down-canyon displacement of coastal-neritic coccoliths should also be \n\nconsidered. On the contrary, relatively higher proportions of coccoliths from oceanic taxa in the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n124 \n\n \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon suggests more oceanic and stable conditions, probably in relation with \n\nits greater distance to the coastal dynamics and limited down-canyon transport. \n\nThis study highlights the impact of sea bottom topography and related oceanographic \n\ncirculation on both taphonomy and ecology of coccolithophores, and provides new insights in \n\nthe role of submarine canyons in influencing the coccolithophore assemblages closer to the \n\ncoast.  \n\n \n\nKey-words: coccoliths; (paleo)ecology; taphonomy; bottom dynamics; Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal canyons \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nCalcareous nannoplankton, predominantly represented by coccolithophores, has the best \n\nfossil record of all marine phytoplankton, with the exception of polar regions (Ziveri et al., \n\n2004). Their calcitic cell-covers (coccoliths or nannoliths sensu lato), are produced by \n\nbiomineralization of tiny calcite crystals arranged according preferential orientations, and \n\nrepresent morphological elements with taxonomic and phylogenetic meaning (Pienaar, 1994; \n\nYoung, 1994). By becoming preserved in the geological archive, the coccoliths store valuable \n\ninformation on palaeoenvironmental conditions from the photic zone (McIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967; \n\nRoth, 1994; Baumann et al., 2000; Boeckel et al., 2008). As such they can be used as markers of \n\npaleoceanographic processes, sea surface water masses, productivity and climate change (e.g. \n\nBeaufort et al., 2001; 2011; Flores et al., 2000; Ziveri et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008). \n\nThe correspondence between the coccolith species assemblages preserved in the seabed \n\nand the living communities thriving in the adjacent photic layer is, however, complex, \n\nparticularly within shallower marine environments such as continental shelves. Complexity \n\nfurther increases in heterogeneous and dynamic regions such as submarine canyons, often acting \n\nas morphological traps of sediment particles and organic matter from the continent and shelf, \n\nand simultaneously, as preferential conduits through which the transport of sediments between \n\nthe coast and the deep sea is intensified (e.g. dense-water cascading and gravity-driven flow \n\nevents) (e.g. Schmidt et al., 2001; Van Weering et al., 2002; Canals et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., \n\n2007; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011).  \n\nApart from their role in channeling water mass exchange and sediment transport between \n\nthe shelf and slope, increased phytoplankton density has been reported to be associated to \n\nsubmarine canyons, resulting from upwelling and bottom sediment resuspension in the upper \n\ncanyon reaches (e.g. Hickey, 1995; Kampf, 2006). The potential of physical processes within \n\ncanyons to concentrate marine organisms in and around the canyons, also related to local \n\nenhancement of primary production, has been reported in several studies (e.g. Macquart-Moulin \n\nand Patriti, 1996; Bosley et al., 2004; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). Whether any of this is reflected \n\nin recent fossil assemblages in canyon sediments is problematic, since high terrigenous \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n125 \n\n \n\nsediment input and strong bottom dynamics typical of submarine canyons are expected to dilute \n\nand disturb the paleoecological signal.  \n\nHere we report the results from a study of recent coccolith assemblages obtained from 92 \n\nsurface sediment samples collected from the central Portuguese margin, where two major \n\nsubmarine canyons are located: the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. Little is known \n\nabout the effect of physical processes operating in these canyons on the ecology of \n\nphytoplankton communities in the overlying water masses. Mendes et al. (2011) investigated \n\nthe distribution and composition of phytoplankton assemblages in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon during an \n\nupwelling event, reporting the highest Chl-a concentrations occurring at the canyon head. \n\nAccording to these authors, persistently high concentrations of diatoms observed south of the \n\ncanyon apparently reflect the occurrence of intensified upwelling along the southern rim of the \n\ncanyon, extending its influence to the southern shelf, and persisting even during the period of \n\nrelaxation of upwelling winds. The late-winter coccolithophore assemblage thriving in the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon region was recently discussed by Guerreiro et al. (sumitted-a), who \n\nhypothesized the presence of local diversity and productivity \u201chotspots\u201d related to the canyon\u2019s \n\ntopography. Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii, Coronosphaera mediterranea and \n\nGephyrocapsa muellerae were the dominant species within the coccolithophore community. \n\nGephyrocapsa oceanica was relatively more abundant at the canyon\u2019s head and southern \n\nadjacent shelf, whereas Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. were consistently thriving \n\nfurther offshore at the middle Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. \n\nTo reveal the (paleo)ecological information contained in calcareous nannoplankton \n\nassemblages from such a heterogeneous region as the central Portuguese margin, we applied \n\nmultivariate analysis in this study, focusing on the larger and taphonomic-resistant \n\ncoccolithophore species, and including data on sediment characteristics. Our aim is to contribute \n\nto the knowledge of this phytoplankton group, its distribution offshore central Portugal, and its \n\npotential as (paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographic proxy in the context of submarine \n\ncanyons. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Regional setting \n\n4.2.1. Central Portuguese margin  \n\nThe central Portuguese margin has a relatively narrow shelf (20\u201350 km wide and a \n\ngradient of&lt;1\u00b0), passing into a steep irregular slope (6\u20137\u00b0) below the shelf-break which is \n\nlocated at 160-200 m depth (Figure 4.1). The shelf is composed of thick Cenozoic detritical \n\nformations, filling structural basins formed during earlier rifting phases. The margin is dissected \n\nby a number of long submarine canyons, of which the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons are \n\nthe most remarkable (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Mougenot, 1989; Alves et al., 2003). \n\nSurface sediments on the shelf are generally very coarse and sand-dominated, and include \n\nold littoral deposits formed during the Holocene transgression preserved at shallow water \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n126 \n\n \n\ndepths. Finer-grained sediments generally increase with depth on the shelf, but also occur in \n\nmuddy deposits located off the estuaries, in structural depressions at the middle shelf and in the \n\ncanyons upper reaches. Fluvial discharge, coastal erosion and biogenic production are the main \n\npresent day fine sediment sources (Dias, 1987; Van Weering et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002). \n\nFurther down in the continental slope, sediments change from slightly coarser and \n\ncompositionally variable on the upper slope towards more uniform fine-grained and carbonate-\n\nricher hemipelagic muds on the deeper slope (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011). \n\nSurface water circulation along the Portuguese margin is directly dependent on two major \n\ncurrent systems that transport surface water masses from west to east across the Atlantic: the \n\nNorth Atlantic Current extending to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, and the Azores Current \n\nsouth of Iberia (Saunders, 1982; Pollard and Pu, 1985; Barton, 2001; Peliz et al., 2005). As the \n\nAzores Current flows eastwards, branches of this current smoothly loop northward into the \n\nPortugal Current and southward into the Canary Current (Saunders, 1982; Barton, 2001). \n\nBeneath the near-surface equatorward flow of the Portugal and Canary currents, the Iberian \n\nPoleward Current (IPC) can be recognized traveling poleward, counter to the general circulation \n\nand closely bound to the continental slope, its core extending about 300-400 m vertically. This \n\ncurrent is mostly restricted to the subsurface layers along most of the eastern subtropical gyre, \n\nbut it surfaces whenever the Trade Winds weaken or turn northward (Barton, 2001). \n\nCirculation over the Portuguese shelf and upper slope displays a marked seasonal \n\nvariation associated with seasonal shifts in the position of the Azores high and Iceland low \n\npressure systems (e.g. Haynes et al., 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007). During summer, \n\nthe Azores high migrates towards the central Atlantic, typically inducing Trade Winds to \n\nbecome northerly, inducing an equatorward circulation over the upper 150-200 m of the water \n\ncolumn off Portugal. Under such conditions, the surface layer of about 30 m thick of relatively \n\nwarmer and lighter water is swept offshore by Ekman transport, allowing colder, less salty and \n\nnutrient enriched subsurface water to rise to the surface along the coast (e.g. Fi\u00faza, 1983; \n\nHaynes et al. 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2011). During winter, the \n\nIceland low intensifies and the dominant wind regime becomes southerly along the western \n\nPortuguese margin. This induces the IPC to rise over the upper slope and shelf, where the \n\npoleward flow produces an onshore Ekman transport, in turn resulting in downwelling \n\nconditions over the shelf (Fi\u00faza, 1983; Vitorino et al., 2002). River runoff is an important \n\nfeature of the winter circulation over the western Portuguese margin. Important discharge \n\nparticularly from the NW Portuguese rivers (Mondego, Douro, Minho, Lima, Vouga) results in \n\nthe formation of low salinity water lenses in the coastal ocean (Peliz et al., 2005). \n\nThe upper 500 m of water column off Portugal, including the surface mixed layer and the \n\nfirst thermocline, is constituted by the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW). This \n\nwater mass, representing the main source of the nutrient-rich upwelled waters on the Portuguese \n\ncoast, shows considerable variation in its hydrological features as it travels along the coast \n\n(Fi\u00faza, 1984; McCave and Hall, 2002). The ENACW has two main components of different \n\norigin, converging to this region: a lighter, relatively warm and salty subtropical branch \n\n(ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually loses its characteristics as it  \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n127 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Geographical location of the central Portuguese margin. Black and green squares indicate \n\nlocation of multi- and boxcores analysed for, respectively, coccoliths and sediment characteristics. \n\nSquares with a black contour mark stations where sediment accumulation rate (SAR\u2019s) was determined. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n128 \n\n \n\ntravels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline colder water mass of subpolar \n\norigin (ENACWsp) slowly flowing southwards below the poleward subtropical branch, related \n\nwith the Subpolar Mode Water formed in the eastern North Atlantic by winter cooling and deep \n\nconvection (Fi\u00faza et al., 1998). \n\nUnderneath the ENACW a strong salinity gradient is noticed down to the core of the \n\nMediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) lying at ~800\u20131400 m depths. The warmer and more \n\nsaline MOW was observed interacting intermittently with the slope to acquire a weak turbidity \n\nof &lt;50 mg/m\n3\n due to local resuspension caused by internal wave and slope current activity, \n\ncontributing to load the overlying ENACW at 500\u2013800 m (mixing zone between ENACW and \n\nMW) (McCave and Hall, 2002). The deeper water masses below the MOW comprise the \n\nNortheast Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) below 2000 m, and the Lower Deep Water (LDW) at \n\nlevels&lt;4000 m (Van Aken 2000ab).  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Submarine canyons \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons are the largest submarine canyons of the central \n\nPortuguese margin, extending from near the shore to abyssal depth, and acting as preferential \n\ndispersal pathways of particulate matter and attached pollutants from the coast to the deep sea \n\n(De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; Richter et al., 2009; Jesus et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2011) (Figure \n\n4.1).  \n\nThe 211 km long Nazar\u00e9 Canyon cuts across the full width of the Portuguese central \n\nmargin, with its head located at ~50 m water depth and less than 1 km from the shore, and its \n\nmouth at almost 5 km water depth opening to the Iberian Abyssal plain. Its upper, middle and \n\nlower courses extend onto ~2000 m, ~4050 m and ~4970 m water depths, respectively (Lastras \n\net al., 2009). \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon is presently not connected to a major modern drainage system, and \n\nobtains its sediment input by capture of particles transported by littoral drift (Duarte et al., 2000) \n\nand along the shelf (Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007). Internal tidal currents actively \n\nresuspend and transport sediment in the upper and middle canyon, as reflected by high \n\nconcentration of suspended particles in bottom waters, high horizontal and vertical sediment \n\nfluxes in the bottom water layer, and high sediment accumulation rates on the seabed (De \n\nStigter et al., 2007). Intermittent sediment gravity flows transport fine-grained sediment further \n\ndown to the lower canyon, but mass transport of coarser material by high-energy turbidity \n\ncurrents, dominant in shaping seabed morphology and sediment deposits of the lower canyon \n\nreaches (Arzola et al., 2008; Lastras et al., 2009) is rare at present. Resuspension of shelf \n\nsediments by winter storms and enhanced input of sediments by the flooding of rivers north and \n\naround the canyon head apparently contribute to trigger sediment gravity flows to the middle \n\ncanyon (Oliveira et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2011; Masson et al., 2011). \n\nResidual currents above 300 m inside the canyon are well related with the wind regimes \n\ncurrent in the western Portuguese margin: upwelling-favourable northerly winds over the shelf \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n129 \n\n \n\ngenerate an onshore up-canyon flow, with upwelling occurring near the canyon head, whereas \n\ndownwelling-favourable southerly winds lead the residual flow near or just above the canyon \n\nrim to become down-canyon. Below 300 m depth, the flow inside the canyon is mostly affected \n\nby the interaction of the northward flowing MOW with the canyon walls (Tyler et al., 2009). \n\nThe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon has a more complex morphology, fed by two main branches: \n\nthe E-W oriented Set\u00fabal branch and the N-S trending Lisbon branch. Like the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, \n\nthe latter is deeply incised into the continental shelf and slope, and extends down to the abyssal \n\nplain at depths >4800 m. Different from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, however, the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon heads, located in somewhat deeper water a few km off the coast, are connected with \n\ntwo major river systems, i.e. Tagus and Sado rivers. The Lisbon and Set\u00fabal branches merge at \n\n2010 m depth, from there the middle course is measured down to the canyon mouth at 4170 m \n\nwater depth, and the lower course extends down to the edge of the Tagus abyssal plain, at ~4860 \n\nm depth (Lastras et al., 2009).  \n\nRecent findings of De Stigter et al. (2011) indicate that the Lisbon Set\u00fabal-Canyon is \n\npresently nearly inactive in terms of down-canyon sediment transport, probably due to the \n\npresence of an overall up-canyon direction of net water transport, leading the particles to settle \n\nin the upper canyon towards the canyon head rather than disperse them down-canyon, and the \n\napparent rareness of sediment gravity flows, which in other canyon systems (e.g. Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon) are the dominant mechanism of down-canyon dispersal. Fine-grained predominantly \n\nlithogenic particles from the adjacent shelf areas accumulate in their upper reaches, whereas the \n\nsediment deposited further down in the middle and lower canyon reaches is essentially \n\nhemipelagic, similar to the sediment found on the adjacent continental slope.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. Material and methods \n\n4.3.1. Cruises and surface sediment sampling \n\nSurface sediment cores used in this study were recovered during several cruises with RV \n\nPelagia of Royal NIOZ, held in November 2002, October 2003, April/May 2004, May 2005, \n\nSeptember 2006 and March 2011 in the central Portuguese margin (cruises 64PE204, 64PE218, \n\n64PE225, 64PE236, 64PE252 and 64PE332, respectively). Coring equipment and methodology \n\nare described in De Stigter et al. (2007, 2011). Sediment coring was concentrated on six \n\ntransects crossing the central Portuguese margin in an approximately E-W direction: (1) three \n\ntransects covering the Nazar\u00e9, Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons; (2) three transects across \n\nthe shelf and open slope off Cape Mondego, Estremadura spur and off Cape Sines. Coring \n\npositions are shown in Figure 4.1 and listed in the Appendix D. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n130 \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Laboratory and microscope analysis \n\n4.3.2.1. Sedimentological analysis  \n\nSedimentological data presented in this paper have been previously presented and \n\ndiscussed by De Stigter et al. (2007, 2011), Jesus et al. (2010) and Costa et al. (2011), with the \n\nexception of material from Stations PE252-01 to -07 on the shelf and slope region west of Cape \n\nMondego, and Stations PE252-40, PE252-43 to -46 and PE252-49 in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and on \n\nthe adjacent middle shelf. Analytical methodology for determining lithogenic material, \n\ncarbonate and organic matter content, particle-size, and sediment accumulation rates, also used \n\nfor analysis of additional cores from stations mentioned above, is described in De Stigter et al. \n\n(2007, 2011).  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.2.2. Calcareous nannoplankton \n\nCalcareous nannoplankton was studied from freeze-dried sediment samples from the top \n\n0.5 or 1 cm of the collected box- and multicores. Slides were prepared following the random \n\nsettling procedure (Flores and Sierro, 1997) and observed under optical polarizing microscope \n\n(Olympus BX-40), at 1250\u00d7 magnification. For coccolith species ? 3\u00b5m, a minimum of 300 \n\nindividual coccoliths, or nannoliths s.l. (here abbreviated to \u201cnanno\u201d) was counted and \n\nidentified in each slide to determine the species abundances (nanno/g). Florisphaera profunda \n\nand small placolith taxa Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii were counted separately, \n\nfor which approximately ten vision fields were counted to estimate the coccolith concentrations \n\nof these species. Concentrations were determined according to the following equation: \n\n \n\n(1)  \nW\n\n1\n\nOa\n\nPa\n\nVp\n\nV\nnN ????  \n\n \n\nWhere, N = nanno/g, n = number of counted coccoliths, V = volume within the glass \n\nbottle (10000 \u00b5l), Vp = volume pipetted and injected into the Petri dish, Pa = Petri dish area, Oa \n\n= observed area (obtained by the number of vision fields, VF, at the microscope, multiplied by \n\nthe unit area correspondent to the microscope; 1 VF Olympus BX-40 = 0.02 mm\n2\n), and W = \n\nweight of the sediment sample. The number of coccoliths per gram of sediment will be \n\ngenerally termed as \u201ccoccolith concentration\u201d throughout the text, to distinguish from the \n\n\u201crelative abundances\u201d calculated as % relative to total coccoliths. \n\nTo magnify the more robust and larger sized coccolith species and minimize possible bias \n\nby differential dissolution, small placolith taxa Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii \n\nwere ruled out from the (paleo)ecological analysis, and used as a general qualitative indicator \n\nfor the degree of preservation of the observed coccolith assemblages. F. profunda was also \n\nexcluded from the analysis due to difficulties in its identification within highly terrigenous \n\nsediment samples as those collected from the studied shelf-slope region. \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n131 \n\n \n\nNine taxa of coccolithophores were selected for this (paleo)ecological study: Calcidiscus \n\nleptoporus (Cl), Coccolithus pelagicus s.l. (Cp), Coronosphaera mediterranea (Cm), \n\nGephyrocapsa muellerae (Gm), Gephyrocapsa oceanica (Go), Helicosphaera carteri (Hc), \n\nUmbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. Due to their \n\nscarcity and the fact that all the three latter taxa are considered as tracers for the onflow of \n\noceanic warmer currents driven along the Azores current onto the Portuguese shelf (Cach\u00e3o et \n\nal., 2000) they were grouped into one single taxonomic variable (UUR). Relative abundances \n\n(%) were determined relative to the sum of the seven taxonomic groups (? 3 \u00b5m).  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Statistical analysis \n\nA Spearman correlation coefficient matrix was built upon a data matrix with the coccolith \n\ntaxa percentages and depth, distance to coast, total coccoliths per gram, percentage of CaCO3, \n\nlithogenic material and organic matter, sediment accumulation rate (SAR), median particle-size, \n\nand percentage of coccoliths with sizes >6 \u00b5m, between 5 and 6 \u00b5m , and between 5 and 3 \u00b5m \n\n(52 cases). A default p-level of 0.05 was considered. Coccolith size classes were defined on the \n\nbasis of coccolith morphometric measurements earlier performed by Cros (2001) and Narciso et \n\nal. (2006), such that: size class >6 \u00b5m includes the coccolith concentrations of Calcidiscus \n\nleptoporus, Coccolithus pelagicus and Helicosphaera carteri; size class between 5 and 6 \u00b5m \n\nincludes the coccolith concentrations of Gephyrocapsa oceanica and Umbilicosphaera sibogae; \n\nand finally, size class between 3 and 5 \u00b5m includes the coccolith concentrations of \n\nCoronosphaera mediterranea and Gephyrocapsa muellerae. \n\nA statistical multivariate analysis (r-mode Factor Analysis by Statistica 10) was \n\nperformed upon a data matrix with the coccolith taxa percentages and the above-mentioned \n\nenvironmental variables, and in addition modal sediment particle-size (\u00b5m) and molar Corg/Ntot \n\nratio, but excluding total coccoliths per gram, SAR and the three size classes of coccoliths (63 \n\ncases). Results from the original data matrix were optimized through Varimax Raw rotation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4. Results \n\n4.4.1. Sedimentary cover in the submarine canyons and adjacent shelf and slope \n\nCharacteristics of superficial sediments from the submarine canyons and adjacent shelf \n\nand slopes of Estremadura spur and west of Cape Sines were previously presented by De Stigter \n\net al. (2007, 2011), Jesus et al. (2010) and Costa et al. (2011), revealing that sediments from the \n\ncanyons significantly differ from those of their adjacent continental margins.  \n\nThe most striking sedimentological features evidenced in Figure 4.2 concern the \n\ndifferences between the canyons upper reaches and their adjacent coastal regions. Much finer-\n\ngrained sediments and higher percentages of lithogenic material and organic matter are recorded \n\nfrom the canyons, whereas a relatively more uniform distribution of particle-size is also \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n132 \n\n \n\nrecorded along their axis, particularly in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. The canyon seabed and lower \n\nwalls were observed to be covered by a superficial layer of mud predominantly composed of \n\nlithogenic material which, in the case of Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, extends downwards to its lower \n\nsection (De Stigter et al., 2007). Adjacent to the canyons, the sedimentary cover is much coarser \n\nnear the coast, particularly off Cape Mondego, and abruptly changing into fine-grained \n\nsediments in the shelf-slope transition. Higher percentages of carbonates and lower percentages \n\nof organic matter are also noticed in coastal areas adjacent to the canyons (Figure 4.2a-e and \n\nTable 4.1). Higher molar Corg/Ntot ratios in the canyons indicate a markedly terrestrial origin of \n\nthe organic matter in these regions (Middelburg and Nieuwenhuize, 1998; Alt-Epping et al., \n\n2007) (Figure 4.2e). Highest SAR\u2019s in the upper and middle canyon reaches (Figure 4.2f) reflect \n\ntheir role as morphological traps and temporary depositories of particles in transit along the \n\nshelf (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011). The highest SAR\u2019s, molar Corg/Ntot ratios and percentage of \n\nlithogenic and organic material, were found in the upper reaches of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon.  \n\nOn the contrary, lower SAR\u2019s were determined for the canyon edges and adjacent margin \n\nareas. The lowest SAR\u2019s obtained from offshore areas, in the lower canyon reaches and adjacent \n\nslope areas are most likely overestimated as bioturbation was not taken into account in \n\ncalculation of SAR\u2019s from down-core radio-isotope profiles (De Stigter et al., 2007, 2011). For \n\nthis reason, higher SAR\u2019s from the open slope of Estremadura spur should be carefully \n\nconsidered. Low terrigenous input arriving to this region, as testified by the extensive areas of \n\nrock outcrops, is possibly due to relatively large distance from continent and bypassing of \n\nlithogenic sediment through canyons north and south of Estremadura Spur (Jesus, 2011).  \n\nThe Estremadura spur and region west of Cape Sines reveal slightly coarser sediment \n\nparticle-size and variable composition on the upper slope, changing towards more uniform fine-\n\ngrained hemipelagic muds on the deeper slope. Towards the coast sediments off Sines become \n\ncoarser. In terms of bulk composition, sediments off Sines are remarkably uniform with water \n\ndepth and similar to those from the Set\u00fabal and Cascais canyons, whereas the Estremadura \n\nslope reveals distinctively lower lithogenic and higher carbonate content (De Stigter et al., 2011; \n\nJesus, 2011). \n\nThe coarsest sediments of the entire study area were recorded on the shelf and upper \n\nslope west of Cape Mondego. On the shelf, sediments have slightly higher lithogenic and lower \n\ncarbonate and organic matter content than at comparable depths off Sines. At slope depths, \n\nsediments off Mondego have similar Corg/Ntot, particle-size and compositional features as those \n\nfrom the other slope regions, with lithogenic and carbonate percentages somewhat in between \n\nthose of the Estremadura and Sines slopes. The shelf-slope transition is characterized by a \n\nnoticeable change of the seabed sedimentological features, with the slope recording relatively \n\nhigher percentages of carbonates and organic matter. \n\nLower molar Corg/Ntot ratios outside the canyons indicate a generally more marine \n\nsignature of the sediment organic matter in these regions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n133 \n\n \n\n4.4.2. Calcareous nannoplankton  \n\nA total of 18 distinct coccolith taxa were recognized using polarizing light microscopy, of \n\nwhich only 9 taxa (= 7 taxonomic groups) were selected for this (paleo)ecological study, based \n\non their relatively higher coccolith concentrations and coccolith dimension (?3 \u00b5m) and \n\nrobustness (see section 3.3.2). Small placolith taxa Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa \n\nericsonii were ruled out of the species percentage determinations, whereas their estimated \n\ncoccolith concentrations are here presented as a general indicator of the degree of preservation \n\nof the coccolith assemblage. The complete list of the observed taxa is presented in Appendix A. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.2.1. Coccolith concentrations  \n\nTotal coccolith concentrations of species ?3 \u00b5m varied between 3\u00d710\n6  \n\nnanno/g at the \n\nshelf of Estremadura Spur and 3\u00d710\n9\n nanno/g at the lower slope off Cape Mondego, with an \n\naverage abundance of 9\u00d710\n8\n nanno/g. Gephyrocapsa muellerae was the most abundant species, \n\nfollowed by Calcidiscus leptoporus, Gephyrocapsa oceanica, the taxonomic group composed \n\nby Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. (UUR), \n\nCoronosphaera mediterranea, Coccolithus pelagicus and Helicosphaera carteri. Mean and \n\nmaximum coccolith concentrations of each species at the five sectors are indicated in Table 4.1.  \n\nCoccolith concentrations generally decrease towards the coast, except in the upper \n\nreaches of the canyons where important values are noticed (Figure 4.3a). High concentrations \n\nwere clearly more associated to finer-grained and carbonate-richer sediments further offshore, \n\nas indicated by the strong negative correlation with sediment particle-size (r\n2\n = -0.83) (Figure \n\n4.3b and Table 4.2) and positive correlation with percentage of CaCO3  (r\n2\n = 0.50) bottom depth \n\n(r\n2\n = 0.64) and distance off the coast (r\n\n2\n = 0.56) (see Table 4.2). \n\nAll the taxonomical groups show this distribution trend, particularly clear in the case of \n\nC. pelagicus, G. muellerae, G. oceanica and UUR. C. mediterranea and H. carteri reveal a \n\nmore irregular W-E distribution, with higher abundances found at intermediate distances to the \n\ncoast (~ between 90-110 and 50 km off the coast), and recording high abundances in the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon. C. leptoporus has a more consistently oceanic distribution, even within the canyons \n\n(data not shown; Guerreiro et al., submitted-c; Chapter 5). \n\nTotal coccolith concentrations of small placolith species ranged between 2\u00d710\n6\n and 2\u00d710\n\n9 \n\nnanno/g (average 4\u00d710\n8\n nanno/g) for belonging to Emiliania huxleyi, and between 4\u00d710\n\n5\n and \n\n2\u00d710\n9\n nanno/g (average 5\u00d710\n\n8\n nanno/g) for Gephyrocapsa ericsonii. Mean and maximum \n\ncoccolith concentrations of the two species at the five sectors are indicated in Table 4.1. In \n\nterms of concentrations, these two species showed a distribution pattern similar to that of larger \n\ncoccolith species (data not shown).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Mean and maximum coccolith abundances, relative to sediment dry weight and relative to the sum of common coccoliths ? 3 \u00b5m, of the seven selected taxonomic \n\ngroups along the five investigated transects.

Nearer to shore, where relative abundances are lower \n\noverall except in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyons, the lowest percentages dropping below 40 % \n\noccur on the Estremadura shelf. Whereas in the upper reaches of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon G. \n\nmuellerae recorded relatively lower percentages similar as in the adjacent coastal regions, this \n\nspecies revealed distinctly higher abundances in the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon, similar to those from further offshore. No correlation was obtained between this \n\nspecies percentages and sediment particle-size in the study area, except off Cape Sines where a \n\nnegative correlation is noticed (r\n2\n = 0.46) (Figure 4.4d).  \n\nGephyrocapsa oceanica, the second most abundant species, shows a clearly coastal \n\npreference in its distribution, with highest relative abundance around 60 % on the Estremadura \n\nshelf (see the plot on the left side of Figure 4.4e). G. oceanica clearly decreases in offshore \n\ndirection to abundances around 10 %. A basically similar distribution pattern is observed in the \n\ncanyons, whereas the lowest percentages close to the coast were recorded in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon. Low correlation was obtained between this species percentages and sediment particle-\n\nsize in the canyons and Estremadura open slope (r\n2\n &lt;0.15), whereas a positive correlation is \n\nnoticed off Cape Mondego and Cape Sines (r\n2\n = 0.73 and r\n\n2 \n= 0.45, respectively) (Figure 4.4e).  \n\nCoronosphaera mediterranea and Helicosphaera carteri are also generally more \n\nabundant closer to shore, the first species reaching particularly high abundances up to 20-25 % \n\nin the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon. Further offshore, the abundance of both species decreases to less \n\nthan 5 %. Although with considerable variation, abundance of H. carteri in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\nfollows a pattern more similar to that from the adjacent shelf and slope. Abundances in the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon are consistently lower, however. No significant correlation was found \n\nbetween C. mediterranea and sediment particle-size (r\n2\n &lt;0.2), whereas H. carteri reveals a \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n137 \n\n \n\nclearly positive correlation off Cape Mondego (r\n2\n = 0.65) and Cape Sines (r\n\n2\n = 0.75) (Figures \n\n4.4b and f). \n\nCalcidiscus leptoporus is consistently more abundant further offshore, particularly on the \n\nEstremadura spur and west of Cape Mondego (Figure 4.4a). Closer to shore, relative \n\nabundances are less than 5 %, except in the southern part of the study area in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon and Sines shelf where higher abundances are found. Relative abundances in the canyons \n\ntend to be higher, but show a similar increase in offshore direction. C. leptoporus reveals no \n\ncorrelation with sediment particle-size in the study area, except off Cape Mondego where a \n\nnegative correlation is noticed (r\n2\n = 0.55).  \n\nUUR are consistently better represented at intermediate distance to shore, generally \n\ncoinciding with upper slope depths. A similar pattern is visible in the canyons. This taxonomic \n\ngroup reveals a weak negative correlation with particle-size at the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon (r\n2\n = \n\n0.28) and off Cape Sines (r\n2\n = 0.39) (Figure 4.4g).  \n\nC. pelagicus, the least abundant species of those considered, with abundances generally \n\nbelow 5%, revealed the weakest coast-ocean gradient in the study area, although this species is \n\ngenerally better represented nearer to shore, in the upper canyon reaches and the adjacent shelf \n\nareas. No significant correlation was obtained between this species percentages and sediment \n\nparticle-size, although a positive correlation is noticed off Cape Sines (r\n2\n = 0.86) (Figure 4.4c).  \n\nAll the taxa revealed a higher variability of relative abundances in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, i.e. \n\nboth low and high percentages were determined at both shorter and greater distances of the \n\ncoast, particularly from sediments with median particle-sizes between 7 and 20 \u00b5m. \n\nWhereas G. oceanica and C. leptoporus display a rather clear oceanic-coastal gradient at \n\nboth submarine canyons and adjacent regions (increasing and decreasing gradients, \n\nrespectively), other species such as C. mediterranea, H. carteri and G. muellerae display \n\ndifferent tendencies in and outside the upper canyon reaches. G. muellerae generally decreases \n\ntowards the coast outside the canyons, whereas important percentage values of this species are \n\nrecorded in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. C. mediterranea stands out for recording much higher \n\nvalues in the upper canyon sections, particularly in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, in comparison to the \n\nadjacent shelf for comparable distances to the coast. Likewise, H. carteri recorded its highest \n\npercentages in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon whereas the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon and Estremadura spur \n\nrecorded its lowest percentage values close to the coast. \n\nSpearman correlation coefficients generally confirm the distributions described above. \n\nSignificant positive correlations are found between individual coastal-neritic taxa as well as \n\nbetween individual oceanic taxa, and negative correlations between coastal and oceanic taxa. \n\nEach group is clearly associated to a specific environmental setting: the oceanic group is often \n\npositively correlated with \u201coceanic factors\u201d such as bottom depth, distance to coast, total \n\ncoccoliths per gram and carbonates, whereas the coastal-neritic group is often positively \n\ncorrelated with \u201ccontinental factors\u201d such as coarser sediment particle-size, lithogenic material \n\nand high Corg/Ntot ratio (Table 4.2).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n138 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013Coccolith relative abundances (%) plotted against distance to coast and median particle-size: \n\nCalcidiscus leptoporus (a), Coronosphaera mediterranea (b), Coccolithus pelagicus (c), Gephyrocapsa \n\nmuellerae (d), Gephyrocapsa oceanica (e), Helicosphaera carteri (f) and Umbilicosphaera sibogae, \n\nUmbellosphaera irregularis, Rhabdosphaera spp. (UUR) (g).

Multivariate statistical analysis  \n\nResults from factor analysis revealed four distinct factor assemblages explaining 70 % of \n\nthe total variance in the data (Table 4.3). Factor 1 (F1) explains 38 % of total variability, with C. \n\nleptoporus (Cl), water depth and distance to coast recording the highest (negative) factor \n\nloadings, in opposition to C. mediterranea (Cm) and G. oceanica (Go) (positive loadings). \n\nFactor 2 (F2) explains 16 % of total variance and it is represented by sediment particle-size \n\n(positive loadings) in opposition to organic matter (OM) (negative loadings). Factor 3 (F3) \n\nexplains 9 % of total variance and it is represented by H. carteri (Hc), Cm, Go (C. pelagicus \u2013 \n\nCp, and OM) (positive loadings) in opposition to G. muellerae (Gm) (negative loadings). Factor \n\n4 (F4) explains 7 % of total variability and it is represented by CaCO3 and UUR (positive \n\nloadings) in opposition to Litho, OM and molar Corg/Ntot ratios (negative loadings). \n\nSamples with F1 positive scores (influenced by the variable cluster Cm and Go) are better \n\nrepresented closer to the coastline in all the investigated sectors, particularly in the upper \n\nreaches of the submarine canyons. Samples with F1 negative scores (influenced by the variable \n\ncluster Cl, depth and distance to coast) are clearly better represented further offshore. The two \n\nsamples from the lowermost Nazar\u00e9 Canyon show conspicuously diverging scores on F1 \n\n(Figure 4.5a).  \n\nSamples with F2 positive scores (represented by coarser sediment particle-size) are better \n\nrepresented closer to the coastline, on the shelves off Cape Mondego and Cape Sines. Lack of \n\nsedimentological data from the shelf at Estremadura spur does not allow a comparison for this \n\narea. Samples with F2 negative scores (represented by OM) are generally better represented \n\nfurther offshore on the open slope areas, whereas the canyons and especially Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\ntypically show negative scores on F2 along their entire length (Figure 4.5b). \n\nSamples with the highest F3 positive scores (represented by the variable cluster Hc, Cm, \n\nGo, Cp and OM) appear concentrated relatively close to the coast in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, \n\nwhereas lower scores without a clear longitudinal or latitudinal separation of positive and \n\nnegative scores is observed in the remaining areas. Samples with F3 negative scores \n\n(represented by Gm) are preferentially distributed further offshore, except in the upper canyon \n\nreaches, where this factor becomes more important close to the shore, particularly in the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon (Figure 4.5c).  \n\nThe distribution of F4 seems to be dominated by the contrast between carbonate-rich \n\npelagic sediments characterized by low OM content of marine signature, versus more \n\nlithogenic-rich sediments characterized by relatively higher OM content with a terrigenous \n\nsignature. Samples with F4 positive scores (represented by the variable cluster CaCO3 and \n\nUUR) prevail on the Estremadura slope. Samples with F4 negative scores (represented by Litho, \n\nOM and molar Corg/Ntot) are better represented along the canyons (Figure 4.5d). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n142 \n\nTable 4.3 - Results from factor analysis: factor loadings, eigenvalues and percentage of the explained \n\nvariance obtained for the investigated surface sediment samples (r-mode Factor Analysis by Statistica 10; \n\nhighlighted loadings are > 0.5).

Discussion \n\n4.5.1. General bottom conditions of the study area \n\nThe central Portuguese margin is a highly heterogeneous region, both topographically and \n\nin terms of sedimentary cover. The most striking expression of this heterogeneity are the two \n\nmajor submarine canyons, Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons, which by cutting across the \n\ncontinental shelf and slope disturb the prevailing pattern of sediment distribution parallel to the \n\nisobaths on the shelf and slope.  \n\nHighest sediment accumulation rate, lithogenic and organic matter content and molar \n\nCorg/Ntot ratios in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon clearly indicate that this area is presently acting as a \n\nsediment depocenter within the central Portuguese margin, actively capturing material of \n\ncontinental origin (Epping et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007) (Figure \n\n4.2). The massive occurrence of nepheloid layers in the upper part of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, and \n\nthe very high sediment fluxes to the canyon floor as recorded in sediment traps and in seabed \n\ndeposits, are clear evidence of the present-day activity of this canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007;  \n\n  \nFactor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 Factor 4 \n\nCl -0.88 -0.06 -0.03 0.26 \n\nCm  0.48 -0.26 0.67 -0.14 \n\nCp  -0.19 0.21 0.39 -0.25 \n\nGm  -0.03 -0.01 -0.94 0.15 \n\nGo  0.47 0.17 0.65 -0.34 \n\nHc  0.29 0.29 0.68 -0.23 \n\nUUR  -0.30 -0.24 -0.32 0.44 \n\nDepth -0.82 -0.25 -0.23 0.04 \n\nDistance  -0.74 -0.09 -0.29 0.31 \n\nCaCO3  -0.20 0.14 -0.20 0.91 \n\nOM  0.21 -0.51 0.37 -0.46 \n\nLitho 0.19 -0.08 0.17 -0.90 \n\nCorg/Ntot  0.08 0.12 -0.03 -0.40 \n\nMedian P-S 0.19 0.89 0.04 0.00 \n\nModal P-S 0.11 0.87 0.09 0.17 \n\nEigenvalue 5.6 2.4 1.3 1.1 \n\nTotal var.

For \n\ncomplete taxonomic references see Table 4.3. \n\n \n\n \n\nOliveira et al., 2007). Although the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head is not presently connected to a major \n\ndrainage system, it is located very close to the coastline (i.e. ~50m water depth; Lastras et al., \n\n2009) favouring sediment input by capture of particles transported by littoral drift (Duarte et al., \n\n2000) and along the shelf (De Stigter et al., 2007; Oliveira et al., 2007). Relative homogeneity \n\nin composition and texture of bottom sediments along the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis reflects the \n\nactive transport of particulate matter along this canyon system (De Stigter et al., 2007). \n\nIntermittent down-canyon sediment gravity flows were observed redistributing sediments along \n\nthe entire length of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis (De Stigter et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2011).  \n\nRelatively lower sediment accumulation rate, organic matter content and molar Corg/Ntot \n\nratios in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon suggest a lesser sedimentary contribution from the \n\ncontinent in comparison to the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Figure 4.2). Although the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon is connected with two major river basins (i.e. Tagus and Sado rivers), the more distant \n\nposition of the canyon heads relative to the coastline results in a sedimentary regime that is less \n\naffected by dynamic coastal processes. Although this canyon is effectively trapping sediment in \n\nits upper reaches, the sediment appears to be mostly derived from vertical flux (De Stigter et al., \n\n2011).  \n\nA markedly different and more heterogeneous sedimentary signature was recorded in the \n\nregions adjacent to the canyons. Coarse sediment prevailing on the inner shelf reflects the effect \n\nof present-day winnowing by waves and currents in the coastal zone, whereas coarse deposits \n\nfurther offshore were formed during stages of lower sea level in the past. Finer grained \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n144 \n\nsediments are progressively sorted as they are transported from shallower towards deeper areas. \n\nMuch lower sediment accumulation rates and lack of fine particles closer to the coast most \n\nlikely result from resuspension and remobilization of fines from the shelf during winter storms \n\n(e.g. Oliveira et al., 2002; Vitorino et al., 2002) (Figure 4.2).  \n\nThe shelf west of Cape Mondego has the coarsest bottom sediments of the investigated \n\nshelf area, reflecting stronger bottom dynamics over this region in comparison to the area west \n\nof Cape Sines, at comparable distances of the coast. Indeed, the continental margin west of Cape \n\nSines reveals a smoother slope gradient, with the 200 m isobath at only ~20 km off the coast, \n\nleading to a more gradual dissipation of tide and wave energy in this region. On the contrary, \n\nthe much broader and flatter shelf off Cape Mondego changes abruptly into a rather steep slope \n\nat 150-200 m water depth, less than 65 km of the coast, resulting in a more abrupt transition \n\nbetween a shallower coarse-grained sediment domain and a deeper fine-grained sediment \n\ndomain (see Figure 4.1). Lack of sedimentological data from the Estremadura shelf does not \n\nallow comparing this region with those above. \n\nHighest percentages of CaCO3 and the lowest molar Corg/Ntot ratios in sediments from the \n\nslope of Estremadura spur are in good agreement with previous studies reporting the presence of \n\na coarse and biogenic shelf sediment cover, with calcite content in the silt-clay fraction reaching \n\nup to 80 % in the deeper parts of the shelf (Balsinha, 2008). These high carbonate contents \n\nsuggest bypassing of terrigenous sediment entering via the shelf and through the Cascais and \n\nNazar\u00e9 canyons, south and north of the spur (Jesus, 2011). Moreover, the low gradient of the \n\nshelf and slope at Estremadura spur and great depth of the shelf-break at 330-400 m depth \n\napparently cause a build-up of wave energy as waves approach the coast, sweeping an area of \n\nalmost 30 km width and preventing fine sediments to deposit (Balsinha et al., 2012). \n\nEstremadura spur has also been reported as a hotspot for internal tide generation on the \n\nPortuguese margin (Quaresma and Pichon, 2011).  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5.2. (Paleo)ecology versus taphonomy  \n\nIn the investigated sediment samples, the smaller coccolith species Emiliania huxleyi and \n\nGephyrocapsa ericsonii displayed concentration values similar or even higher than those of \n\nlarger coccolith species (?3 \u00b5m), providing a general and qualitative indicator that the \n\nassemblages were not significantly affected by dissolution. The occasional presence of intact \n\ncoccospheres at both shallower and deeper regions (up to 3914 m), even in the context of \n\nhydrodynamically active systems as the submarine canyons, is an additional indication of the \n\ngood preservation of the sediment coccolith assemblages.  \n\nAll the species (both smaller and larger) were more abundant at greater distances off the \n\ncoast and revealing a negative correlation with sediment particle-size and lithogenic material, \n\nmostly reflecting the important bottom water hydrodynamic control on coccolith accumulation \n\nin the sediment (data not shown, Guerreiro et al., submitted-c; Chapter 5). Whereas winnowing \n\nby waves and currents hampers the accumulation of coccoliths in coarse-grained deposits of the \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n145 \n\n \n\nshelf and upper slope, coccoliths will preferentially accumulate in fine-grained hemipelagic \n\ndeposits that accumulate in more quiescent environments of the middle and lower slope, and the \n\ncanyons (Figure 4.3).  \n\nIn the upper slope and shelf regions the highest coccolith concentrations were recorded in \n\nthe southern part of the study area, west of Sines, whereas further offshore, on the open slope, \n\nhighest coccolith concentrations are recorded further north, west of Mondego. \n\nHighest coccolith concentrations in the southernmost sector of the study area, west of \n\nCape Sines, most likely reflect the smoother bottom morphology of this area, leading to a more \n\ngradual dissipation of tide and wave energy and favouring the settling of coccoliths and their \n\nintegration in the sedimentary record. In turn, lower abundances on the upper-slope and shelf off \n\nCape Mondego and Estremadura spur probably reflect strongest bottom hydrodynamics \n\nprevailing in these regions, already illustrated by their coarser sedimentary cover (see section \n\n4.5.1). In their earlier study, Abrantes and Moita (1999) also observed higher coccolith \n\nabundances along the southern and southwestern Portuguese shelf, and lower abundances on the \n\nnorthern Portuguese shelf, reflecting distinct bottom morphologies, hydrodynamics and \n\ndepositional conditions prevailing in the two regions. Nevertheless, the presence of more \n\npersistently productive conditions off Sines, due to its proximity to the upwelling centre of Cape \n\nS. Vicente, should not be discarded.  \n\nHigher coccolith concentrations of all taxa in the upper canyon reaches, in comparison to \n\nadjacent coastal regions (data not shown, Guerreiro et al., submitted-c; Chapter 5), reflect the \n\nrole of the canyons as preferential depocenters of suspended fine-grained particles, not only \n\nterrigenous (e.g. Oliveira et al, 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007), but also biogenic; in this case, \n\nboth derived from coccolithophore productivity in the overlaying photic layer (vertical flux), \n\nand from lateral transport of resuspended coccoliths. Relatively higher abundances in the upper \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon vs. slightly more homogeneous distribution of coccolith abundance \n\nvalues along the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis may be related with differences in the sedimentary settings \n\nbetween the two canyons as discussed in section 4.5.1: trapping of particles derived from \n\nvertical flux in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon vs. down-canyon transport by tidal currents and \n\nsediment gravity flows in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011).  \n\nDilution of coccoliths with lithogenic material seems less important than the \n\nhydrodynamic control on the coccoliths deposition, in view of the lack of significant negative \n\ncorrelation between coccolith abundance and lithogenic content. Rather, it appears that \n\ncoccoliths are deposited along with the fine sediment fraction, irrespective of whether that is \n\nderived from land or of marine origin. Results strongly suggest that preferential deposition in \n\nfine-grained sediments is affecting all the studied taxa equally, and thus coccolith abundances \n\nrelative to dry sediment weight appears unsuitable for investigating species\u2019 ecological inter-\n\nrelationships. Species relative abundance (%) within the total of common larger coccoliths will \n\nbe used hereinafter to infer the species\u2019 ecological inter-relationships independently of bottom \n\nsediment dynamics. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n146 \n\n4.5.3. (Paleo)ecological, (paleo)oceanographical and environmental conditions \n\nThe observed coccolith species assemblages generally agree with previous studies \n\nperformed in the Portuguese margin, reflecting the prevailing surface oceanographic circulation \n\nand the convergence of water masses from both subtropical and temperate regions (e.g. Cach\u00e3o, \n\n1993; Guerreiro et al., 2005; 2009). Differences between coastal and oceanic regions, and \n\nbetween the submarine canyons and their adjacent margins reflect the important heterogeneity \n\nof the central Portuguese margin, in terms of coccolithophore ecology, oceanographic and \n\nsedimentary processes, seabed and coastal topography.  \n\nResults from factor analysis revealed to be statistically significant (i.e. 70 % of explained \n\nvariance) and able to summarize the most striking environmental and (paleo)ecological signals \n\npreserved in the sedimentary record of the study area (Figure 4.5, Table 4.2).  \n\nThe most distinctive (paleo)ecological assemblages recorded in the sedimentary record \n\nare represented in F1 and F3. F1 represents the coast-to-ocean ecological gradient, with C. \n\nmediterranea and G. oceanica clearly more abundant closer to the coast, and C. leptoporus \n\nfurther offshore (Figure 4.5a). F3 is represented by two distinct coccolith species assemblages; a \n\ncoastal assemblage composed by H. carteri, C. mediterranea, G. oceanica particularly \n\nimportant in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, in contrast with G. muellerae which is most common in \n\noceanic waters outside the canyons.  \n\nG. muellerae is by far the most abundant coccolith species, dominating the assemblages \n\nof both coastal and offshore areas in all transects, except on the Estremadura shelf where G. \n\noceanica was more abundant. This broad distribution suggests that this species is optimally \n\nadapted for the environmental conditions of the Portuguese margin. The dominance of G. \n\nmuellerae in sediments from the Portuguese continental shelf has been previously reported by \n\nGuerreiro et al. (2005, 2009). Outside the canyons G. muellerae is generally found in highest \n\nrelative abundance in more open oceanic environments, whereas lower abundances are found \n\ncloser to the coast (Figures 4.4d and 4.5c). High relative abundances of G. muellerae equal to \n\nabundances more typically found in the offshore areas are observed in the upper reaches of the \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. Since abundances on the adjacent Sines and Estremadura shelves are \n\ndistinctly lower than in the canyon, the high abundances in this canyon may be interpreted to \n\nreflect up-canyon displacement of coccoliths derived from the deeper canyon and slope, along \n\nwith the overall up-canyon suspended sediment transport that seems to occur in this canyon (De \n\nStigter et al., 2011). Being by far the most abundant species in open slope sediments, any \n\nresuspension and up-canyon transport of open slope material will result in an increase of G. \n\nmuellerae percentages in the upper canyon. This will, at least partially, mask the \u201creal\u201d \n\necological relationships in this region. On the other hand, given that G. muellerae is the most \n\nabundant oceanic species, its increase in the middle Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and upper Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon in comparison to the adjacent regions, could be tracing the preferential onflow of more \n\noceanic water masses throughout the canyons, as it has been reported to occur in canyon \n\nsystems (e.g. Skliris and Djenidi, 2006; Guerreiro et al, submitted-a \u2013 Chapter 3).  \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n147 \n\n \n\nConsistently higher percentages of coccoliths from C. leptoporus further offshore are \n\nindicative of its stronger affinity for more oceanic-oligotrophic environments (Figures 4.4a and \n\n4.5a). Previously, Silva et al. (2008) recognized C. leptoporus as a winter-species in Lisbon bay, \n\ntracing the advection of subtropical oceanic waters to this region. Guerreiro et al. (submitted-a) \n\n(see Chapter 3) observed it thriving further offshore in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, during late-winter. \n\nAlso with regards to its larger-scale distribution, C. leptoporus is generally more associated to \n\noceanic-oligotrophic environments, preferentially occurring within oceanic gyre centers (Ziveri \n\net al., 2004) and revealing an optimal growth under oligotrophic conditions (Sprengel et al., \n\n2002). That percentages of C. leptoporus are higher on the Sines shelf than on the Estremadura \n\nand Mondego shelf may reflect a stronger influence of water masses of subtropical origin in the \n\nsouthern part of the study area.  \n\nAmong the coccoliths showing a preferential near-shore distribution, i.e. G. oceanica, C. \n\nmediterranea and H. carteri, high percentages of C. mediterranea in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon are \n\nparticularly interesting because these are in good agreement with a recent study describing the \n\nlate-winter coccolithophores thriving in this region, where this species was observed to be more \n\nabundant in the upper canyon and canyon head (Guerreiro et al., submitted-a; Chapter 3) \n\n(Figures 4.4b and 4.5c). The rapid response of C. mediterranea to nutrient availability was \n\nrecently observed at the shelf-break off Nazar\u00e9 by Guerreiro et al. (2013) (Chapter 2). Enhanced \n\npercentages of C. mediterranea in the canyon head, in comparison to the adjacent coastal areas \n\nseems to genuinely reflect its live distribution in this area, possibly reflecting favourable local \n\nconditions provided by the canyon near coast.  \n\nHighest percentages of H. carteri recorded in the northern part of the study area agree to \n\nsome extent with previous studies performed on the Portuguese margin, reporting an increase of \n\ncoccoliths from this species in the NW Portuguese shelf (Cach\u00e3o, 1993; Guerreiro et al., 2005; \n\n2009). An extremely high percentage of H. carteri (~85 %) was found by Guerreiro et al. (2005) \n\nin sediments from the mouth of the Douro estuary, interpreted as reflecting an opportunistic \n\nbehaviour possibly related with locally confined nutrient-rich conditions. Moita et al. (2010) \n\nalso observed H. carteri to be more abundant in winter west of the Douro River. The important \n\nrecord of H. carteri in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon may reflect its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich coastal \n\nenvironments. It may also reflect the good preservation of its large-sized and robust coccoliths \n\nin the dynamic bottom environment of the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon.  \n\nThe coastal distribution of coccoliths from G. oceanica in all the five sectors clearly \n\nconfirms its coastal ecological preference off central Portugal. Our results are in agreement with \n\nearlier studies which identified G. oceanica as a typical coastal coccolithophore, well adapted to \n\nthe nutrient-rich and productive environment found in Portuguese coastal waters (Silva et al., \n\n2008). It is seen as an indicator for maximum upwelling conditions, showing a quick response \n\nto nutrient input (Winter et al., 1994; Giraudeau and Bailey, 1995; Broerse et al., 2000; \n\nAndruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Sprengel et al., 2002; Andruleit et al., 2003; Guerreiro et al., \n\n2013). The rapid response of this species to favourable nutrient and light conditions was \n\nrecently observed during a late winter coccolith bloom in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon area, where G. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n148 \n\noceanica occurred in association with the opportunistic Emiliania huxleyi and small-chain \n\ndiatoms (i.e. Chaetoceros s.l. and Thalassiosira s.l.) which are indicators of the first stage of \n\nupwelling (Guerreiro et al., 2013 \u2013 Chapter 2). Highest percentages of G. oceanica observed on \n\nthe Estremadura shelf are in good agreement with previously reported high coccolith \n\nconcentrations and relative abundances of this species in surface sediments from the shelf south \n\nof the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Guerreiro et al., 2009). Results agree with previous studies which \n\nidentified the spur as potentially favourable for marine productivity (i.e. Jesus, 2011; Quaresma \n\nand Pichon, 2011).  \n\nCoccolithus pelagicus and the taxonomical group UUR show weaker coast-ocean trends \n\nand a weaker signal obtained from factor analysis (Figure 4.4c), possibly reflecting a relatively \n\nbroader range of ecological preferences in comparison to other coccolithophore species clearly \n\nrevealing an oceanic (i.e. C. leptoporus) or coastal affinity (G. oceanica, C. mediterranea, H. \n\ncarteri). For both C. pelagicus and the UUR group there are no noteworthy differences between \n\nthe submarine canyons and the adjacent shelf and slope. C. pelagicus appears weakly correlated \n\nto the coastal-neritic assemblage from F3 reflecting the preferential coastal distribution of this \n\nspecies (Figure 4.5c), which somewhat supports previous studies describing its close relation \n\nwith the Portuguese upwelling system (Cach\u00e3o and Moita, 2000; Parente et al., 2004; Narciso et \n\nal., 2006; Silva et al., 2008). On the contrary, UUR are notably more abundant at greater \n\ndistances of the coast, particularly in the southern part of the study area, possibly reflecting the \n\nstronger influence of ENACWst water masses in this region (Fi\u00faza et al., 1998).  \n\nDifferences in the coccolith assemblages between the two upper canyons could reflect \n\ndifferences in their environmental settings: (1) a more coastal ecological signature (i.e. C. \n\nmediterranea, H. carteri, and somewhat G. oceanica) in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head indicating \n\nhigher nutrient availability in this area, resulting from the proximity of the canyon head to the \n\ncoast and the associated intensification of upwelling, and stronger internal tidal activity in the \n\nupper canyon. This is supported by Chl-a time series recently obtained from satellite data \n\nrevealing that the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head is the stage of high productivity throughout the year and \n\nparticularly from March to October, (Guerreiro et al., submitted-a; Chapter 3); and (2) a more \n\noceanic ecological signature in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon reflecting more stable and \n\noligotrophic conditions in this area resulting from the more distant position of the canyon heads \n\nrelative to coastal dynamics. In addition, as mentioned before, influence from ENACWst is also \n\nexpected to be stronger in the southern part of the study area, and thus, leaving a clearer \n\n\u201coceanic ecological imprint\u201d (i.e. C. leptoporus and UUR) in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. \n\nF2 and F4 are mostly reflecting the differences in the sedimentary dynamics between the \n\nsubmarine canyons and the adjacent shelf and slope regions, already discussed in sections 4.4.1 \n\nand 4.5.1 (Figures 5b,d).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n149 \n\n \n\n4.5.4. Coccoliths as (paleo)ecological proxies in coastal regions  \n\nLinking living coccolithophore communities to the corresponding coccolith assemblages \n\npreserved in seabed sediments is complex, particularly in dynamic coastal areas and in places \n\nwhere the continental margin is dissected by submarine canyons, promoting the interplay of \n\ncontinental and marine factors (e.g. Steinmetz, 1994; Roth, 1994). Sediments in such areas \n\nalways contain a cumulative averaged signal composed of the sub-signals from all intervening \n\nfactors, of which only the stronger leave a recognizable \u201cimprint\u201d in the sediment. Our \n\nchallenge consists in finding the best clues that may lead us to a better understanding of the \n\nmore important phenomena. \n\nResults presented in this study indicate that it is more difficult to make ecological \n\ninferences based on coccoliths from the sedimentary record of canyons, in comparison to \n\nadjacent margins. The more mixed assemblages of coccoliths in the canyons, including both \n\ncoastal-neritic and oceanic species, reflects the enhanced exchange of water masses between \n\ncoastal and oceanic regions through the canyons. However, this exchange may on the one hand \n\ninvolve the advection of living coccolithophores from oceanic to more coastal areas in the upper \n\nwater masses, whereas on the other hand coccoliths produced by coastal-neritic species in the \n\nupper canyon reaches may be transported down-canyon by internal tides and turbidity currents \n\nacting along the bottom of the canyon. In the end, we can only interpret the general \n\ntrends/signals along the canyon by reference to the signal from the surrounding areas (i.e. \n\n\u201cbackground\u201d). \n\nWhereas coccoliths appear to be preferentially included in finer-grained sediments, no \n\nconsistent evidence for selective transport or preservation of individual taxa was found. C. \n\nleptoporus and H. carteri, two taxa of comparable sizes and comparable degrees of resistance to \n\ndissolution and physical breakage, revealed clearly distinctive distribution patterns unrelated to \n\ntrends in sediment particle-size. G. oceanica and C. mediterranea, two smaller and more fragile \n\ncoccolith species, are preferably found closer to the coast despite the stronger winnowing and \n\ndestructive mechanical forces in that area.  \n\nApparent correlations of certain species (e.g. C. leptoporus, H. carteri, G. oceanica and \n\nC. mediterranea) with particle-size to our understanding are more likely due to parallel trends in \n\nthe distribution of these species and particle-size, than representing a causal relationship. \n\nAlthough somewhat diluted, these coast-ocean gradients were also observed in the \n\ncanyons, even in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, where down-canyon transport of suspended particles \n\ncontinuously occurs, forced by the canyon internal tide. Moreover, the canyons revealed \n\nspecific features, which are most likely related with the intensified interplay of both sedimentary \n\nand ecological factors in these areas (i.e. enhanced percentages of G. muellerae in the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon head indicating up-canyon transport of resuspended coccoliths and/or \n\npreferential onflow of oceanic water masses throughout the canyon; and enhanced percentages \n\nof H. carteri and C. mediterranea in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head indicating dissolution and \n\nbreakage resistance and/or ecological preference for nutrient-rich local conditions in this sector). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n150 \n\n4.6. Conclusions \n\nThis study provides new insights into the impact of sea bottom topography and related \n\noceanographic circulation on both taphonomy and ecology of coccolithophores, and the role of \n\nsubmarine canyons as preferential conduits for the onflow of oceanic water masses into more \n\ncoastal regions, and the down-canyon transport of suspended particles near the bottom.  \n\nThe central Portuguese margin represents a highly heterogeneous region, strongly marked \n\nby the presence of two major submarine canyons, the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons, \n\nwhich leave a very distinctive sedimentary and (paleo)ecological signature in seabed sediments \n\nfrom this region. \n\nRemarkably high SAR\u2019s and a predominantly lithogenic, organic-rich and fine-grained \n\nsedimentary cover clearly distinguishes the canyon\u2019s upper reaches from their adjacent margins. \n\nGreater longitudinal homogeneity in sediment composition and texture along the canyons, as \n\ncompared to the adjacent shelf and slope areas, reflects their function as preferential conduits \n\nfor the transport of particles towards the oceanic basin.  \n\nCoccoliths produced by calcareous nannoplankton were found to be useful tracers to \n\ninvestigate (paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographic trends prevailing in the central \n\nPortuguese margin, supporting previous studies focused on the sedimentary dynamics prevailing \n\nin the canyons. The increase of coccolith concentrations further offshore is interpreted as \n\nreflecting the oceanic nature of coccolithophores, coupled with physical sorting resulting in \n\npreferential accumulation of coccoliths with the finer-grained hemipelagic sediments. Relatively \n\nhigher coccolith abundances of all taxa in the upper canyons, in comparison to their adjacent \n\ncoastal regions, reflect the role of the canyons as preferential depocenters of fine-grained \n\nsediments, not only terrigenous but also biogenic and including coccoliths derived from local \n\nproduction as well as from lateral transport. \n\nCoccoliths from Coronosphaera mediterranea, Helicosphaera carteri and Gephyrocapsa \n\noceanica showed a markedly coastal distribution, revealing to be good (paleo)ecological proxies \n\nfor enhanced productivity in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon and Estremadura spur. Calcidiscus \n\nleptoporus was consistently better represented further offshore and appeared to be a good proxy \n\nfor coccolithophore production occurring further offshore. Together with Umbilicosphaera \n\nsibogae, Umbellosphera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp., this species appears to be tracing \n\nthe preferential onflow of ENACWst into the southern part of the central Portuguese shelf. \n\nGephyrocapsa muellerae was by far the most abundant species, showing the broadest ecological \n\ntolerance, but generally more oceanic, particularly outside the canyons. Enhanced percentages \n\nof this species in the upper Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon may be indicating up-canyon transport of \n\nresuspended coccoliths from the bottom benthic layer and/or preferential onflow of oceanic \n\nwater masses through the canyon. \n\nThe mix of coccoliths from both coastal-neritic and oceanic species in the canyons \n\nappears to reflect the enhanced exchange of water masses between more coastal and oceanic \n\nregions through the canyons, in comparison to the adjacent shelf and slope regions. Highest \n\npercentages of H. carteri and C. mediterranea in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, in comparison to \n\n\n\nCoccoliths from recent sediments \n\n \n151 \n\n \n\nthe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, may be indicative of differences in the environmental conditions \n\nbetween the two canyon systems: greater proximity of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head to the coastline \n\nresults in a stronger influence of coastal dynamics, characterized by more dynamic and nutrient-\n\nrich conditions to which r-selected coccolithophore species are better adapted; on the contrary, \n\nhigher percentages of coccoliths from G. muellerae, C. leptoporus and UUR in the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon suggests that a generally more oceanic-pelagic environment prevails in this \n\ncanyon, explained by its greater distance from the coast and present-day lack of down-canyon \n\nsediment transport.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements - Data for this study were collected in the framework of the EU-funded \n\nEUROSTRATAFORM (contract EVK3-CT-2002-00079) and HERMES EU-funded projects (contract \n\nGOCE-CT-2005-511234), \u2018\u2018Lead in Canyons\u2019\u2019 and \u201cPacemaker\u201d projects funded by the Netherlands \n\nOrganization for Scientific Research, and by the Portuguese project Cd Tox-CoN (FCT-\n\nPTDC/MAR/102800/2008).

Rodrigues \n\nSubmitted to Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology \n \n\n \n\nAbstract  \n\nSubmarine canyons are a common feature of most continental margins, and associated \n\nwith them physical forcing mechanisms exist that may provide a nutrient source for local \n\nphytoplankton development. Phytoplankton assemblages characteristic of the canyon setting \n\nmay be preserved in sediments accumulating within and adjacent to the canyon, but high \n\nterrigenous sediment input and strong bottom dynamics are expected to significantly dilute and \n\ndisturb the (paleo)ecological signal. The main challenge for paleoenvironmental reconstructions \n\nconsists in extracting the ecological signal from taphonomical distortions, particularly \n\nintensified in these contexts. \n\nCoccolith assemblages preserved in 89 superficial sediment samples from the Nazar\u00e9 and \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons and adjacent shelf and slope regions off central Portugal were \n\ninvestigated. Results from using classical analytical methods, (i.e. coccolith concentrations - \n\nnanno/g; coccolith fluxes - nanno/cm\n2\n/yr; and percentages) are compared to results from using \n\nCompositional Data Analysis (CoDA) and further discussed.  \n\nBoth coccolith concentrations and fluxes showed spatial trends in which the species\u2019 \n\necological inter-relationships appear to be masked by taphonomical phenomena, especially \n\ntowards the coast and in the canyons. Calculation of species percentages relative to the sum of \n\ncommon taxa, eliminating the common sedimentological factors that affect all the taxa equally, \n\nrevealed distinct ecological signals among the studied taxa. In particular the existence of an \n\nassemblage of coastal-neritic affinity, and another of oceanic affinity. Nevertheless, given the \n\nspurious correlations and biased statistical analysis associated to percentage determinations, the \n\ncoastal-neritic and oceanic assemblages and their spatial distribution were validated and \n\nconfirmed using CoDA, specifically the isometric log-ratio approach (ilr).  \n\nProviding scale invariance and subcompositional coherence between the components (i.e. \n\ntaxa), CoDA appears to be a robust statistical tool to study the (paleo)ecology of \n\ncoccolithophores, corroborating in the present case results derived from percentage \n\ndeterminations. Results clearly confirmed the coastal-neritic distribution of coccoliths from  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n156 \n\nGephyrocapsa oceanica, Helicosphaera carteri and Coronosphaera mediterranea, \n\nwhereas coccoliths from Calcidiscus leptoporus, Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera \n\nirregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. more typically occurred offshore. (Paleo)ecological \n\ndifferences between canyons and adjacent shelf and slope areas, and between the two studied \n\ncanyons, reflect their distinct environmental settings. More pronounced mixing of coccoliths \n\nfrom both assemblages in the canyons reflect the capacity of these structures in promoting the \n\nexchange between coastal and oceanic water masses (ecological signal), as well as the role of \n\ninternal tides and sediment gravity flows in disturbing and homogenizing the sedimentary \n\nrecord (taphonomical signal). Higher \u201cweight\u201d of the coastal-neritic assemblage in the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon suggests a more dynamic and nutrient-rich environment favourable for coastal \n\nopportunistic species to develop, whereas the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon appears to exhibit more \n\noceanic and stable conditions, probably due to the greater distance of its two canyon heads to \n\nthe dynamic coastal zone.  \n\nResults suggest that the (paleo)ecological signal preserved in the studied sediment \n\nsamples is robust enough to be revealed by the two methods, even within a bottom environment \n\nas heterogeneous and dynamic as present on the central Portuguese margin. This study \n\nillustrates the potential of percentages in providing a first indication of the most important \n\necological signals preserved in the sediment and the pointers in which the sequential binary \n\npartition will be based on, whereas the ilr is fundamental to test and validate such signals, \n\nassuring that all the available information is extracted from the data and that (paleo)ecological \n\ninterpretations are correctly performed. \n\n \n\nKeywords: coccoliths; CoDA; isometric log-ratios; percentages; Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\ncanyons; Portuguese margin \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nCoccolithophores are the predominant phytoplankton group within calcareous \n\nnannoplankton, commonly used as (paleo)environmental proxies and markers of oceanographic \n\nprocesses (e.g. Ziveri et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008) due to their exceptional fossil record in \n\nboth open ocean (e.g. Ziveri et al., 2004) and continental shelf/slope sediments (e.g. Cach\u00e3o and \n\nMoita, 2000; Guerreiro et al., 2005; submitted-b; Chapter 4). Although affected by various post-\n\nmortem (biostratonomical) mechanisms, studies indicate that coccolith thanatocoenoses \n\npreserved in surface sediments can be closely related to the coccolithophore communities \n\ndwelling in the overlaying photic layer (e.g. Abrantes and Moita, 1999; Baumann et al., 2000; \n\nKinkel et al., 2000; Sprengel et al., 2002; Boeckel and Bauman, 2008) due to rapid transfer \n\nmechanisms mediated by zooplankton grazing (Steinmetz, 1994; Balch, 2004). Thereby, \n\ncoccoliths provide a particularly useful calibration link with oceanographic conditions since \n\nthey reflect the physical and ecological patterns that are strong and persistent enough to be \n\npreserved in the fossil record (Ziveri et al., 2004).  Nevertheless, the correspondence between \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n\n157 \n\nthe coccolithophore living communities and the coccolith species assemblages preserved in the \n\nseabed is complex, particularly close to the coast and in the context of a continental margin \n\ndissected by submarine canyons, where both continental and marine factors interplay. Factors \n\nthat control the sedimentation of coccolithophores and the distribution of coccoliths in recent \n\n(oceanic) sediments have been earlier discussed by Steinmetz (1994) and Roth (1994).  \n\nProductivity of coccolithophores (P) is primarily a function of light and nutrients, \n\nmodulated by hydrological parameters like temperature, salinity, turbulence and turbidity (see \n\nMargalef, 1978). Seasonal variability in controlling parameters results in successions of \n\nseasonally distinct coccolithophore biocoenoses. The coccolith fossil record (FR) preserved in \n\nthe seafloor sediment results from this primary signal, further affected by several processes here \n\ncategorized in necrolysis (N), biostratonomy (B), variations in the sediment accumulation rate \n\n(SAR), sediment mixing mostly driven from bioturbation (M) and diagenesis (D), all \n\ntaphonomical phenomena that act upon the coccospheres/coccoliths (Figure 5.1). In other \n\nwords, whereas a certain P represents the cumulative coccolithophore production of a certain \n\nregion of the ocean, FR is the cumulative average over several months, years, decades, centuries \n\nor even thousands of years of continuous productivity, more or less distorted by taphonomy. For \n\neach sampling point, FR can be conceptually represented as follows (equation 1): \n\n \n\n    ?    (  )\n \n        (  )   (  )   (  )                                                    (1) \n\n \n\nwhere ti = 1, 2,\u2026, n is time, and PE = (paleo)ecological record, referring to the most recent \n\ncoccoliths deposited on the seafloorbut prior to burial, i.e. coccolith thanatocoenosis. PE can be \n\nconsidered as the summation of three major components: one here called \u201cweak\u201d ecological \n\nsignal (PEw), a \u201cstrong\u201d ecological signal (PEs) and a third component of biostratonomical \n\nnature (PE\u2019) (equation 2): \n\n \n\nPE = PEw + PEs + PE\u2019                                                                                     (2) \n\n \n\nPEw represents the ecological component that derives from continuous production of \n\ncoccolithophores (P1) and results from isolated cell lysis (N1) and/or coccolith dispersion and \n\nsinking (B1) through the water column (equation 3).  \n\n \n\nPEw = P1 \u00d7 N1 \u00d7 B1                                                                                         (3) \n\n \n\nDue to their minute dimensions, isolated coccospheres/coccoliths can stay suspended in \n\nthe water column over extended periods of time, eventually becoming dispersed or even \n\ndissolved before reaching the bottom (Roth, 1994; Steinmetz, 1994). For this reason, PEw is \n\nconsidered negligible in terms of contribution to the (paleo)ecological record and thus will not \n\nbe further considered. \n\nPEs is the stronger ecological signal i.e. able to introduce changes in species inter-\n\nrelationships in the sedimentary record, controlled by coccolithophore blooms (P2) triggering \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\n158 \n\nzooplankton grazing (N2), in turn resulting in the incorporation of large amounts of \n\ncoccospheres in faecal pellets, which are rapidly transported towards the bottom (B2) (equation \n\n4): \n\nPEs = P2 \u00d7 N2 \u00d7 B2                                                                                         (4) \n\n \n\nVertical transport inside faecal pellets is considered the most efficient mechanism for \n\ncoccoliths to be transferred to the bottom (Steinmetz, 1994). Assuming that zooplankton and \n\nnekton are not selective for minute coccolithophore cells, grazing provides a mechanism to \n\nefficiently sample coccolithophore assemblages from the upper part of the water column, and \n\npackaged in faecal pellets rapidly transferring them to the seafloor, thus contributing to \n\nformation of the sedimentary record. Given that biological breakage and dissolution due to \n\ngrazing probably represent an important alteration factor (Harris, 1994), only the \n\ncoccolithophores which were incorporated without total destruction into fast sinking faecal \n\npellets or marine snow aggregates are likely to be preserved (Honjo, 1976; 1980). \n\nFinally, PE\u2019 represents allochtonous coccolithophore productivity, i.e. advected from \n\nadjacent water masses. According to Ziveri et al. (2004), a sediment sample may include \n\ncoccoliths produced within a geographical area of at least 100 km\n2\n, with lateral transport leading \n\nto the eventual loss of the smaller and most delicate species. PE\u2019 can also incorporate reworked \n\nfossil or subfossil specimens resuspended from the bottom of continental shelf and slope \n\nregions. PE\u2019 is particularly important where the continental margin is dissected by submarine \n\ncanyons, given that these are regions of intensified sedimentary dynamics (i.e. coastal \n\ndynamics, internal tides, gravity flows; Arzola et al., 2008; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011). \n\nIn equation 2, SAR represents the effect of dilution of the coccolith thanatocoenosis with \n\nother sedimentary material (including reworked coccoliths) whereas M represents mixing by \n\norganisms living in the benthic sediment layer, both occurring at the seafloor, the latter of which \n\nresulting in more or less homogenised coccolith taphocoenoses. After burial, the latter \n\nassociation will be further subjected to diagenesis (D) occurring on longer time scales (i.e. \n\ncenturies, thousands or millions of years). Processes such as dissolution and recrystallization \n\nwill tend to preferentially eliminate the smaller and more delicate forms while favouring the \n\npreservation of the larger and more robust ones, resulting in an orictocoenosis only partially \n\nrepresenting the original assemblage. \n\nIn conclusion, all these phenomena are represented, for each sampling point, as follows \n\n(equation 5): \n\n \n\n    ? (        (  )     (  ))     (  )   (  )                                            (5) \n\n \n\nPEs is the ecological term that should be extracted from the fossil record, in order to make \n\necological and subsequent oceanographic inferences. To extract PEs from FR, the effects of \n\nadvection and reworking (PE\u2019), variations in sedimentation (SAR) and diagenesis (D) must be \n\nremoved.  \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n\n159 \n\nDistortions induced by D can be significantly reduced by: (1) studying Upper Holocene \n\nsediment records for which diagenesis can be assumed to be negligible; or (2) selecting species \n\nwith a similar degree of resistance to dissolution/recrystallization. The (paleo)ecological signal \n\nwithin the thus reconstructed taphocoenosis is now only affected by the biostratonomical \n\nadvective and reworked components (PE\u2019) and variations on SAR.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - Schematic representation of the principal factors that affect the coccolithophore assemblage \n\nfrom the moment of its production (biocoenosis) on the oceanic photic layer towards the moment of its \n\nburial (thanatocoenosis -> taphocoenosis-> orictocoenosis). P2 = productivity resulting from \n\ncoccolithophore blooms, N2 = necrolysis mediated by zooplankton grazing, B2 = rapid vertical transfer of \n\ncoccospheres within fecal pellets produced by zooplankton, PEs = Strong ecological signal, PE\u2019 = \n\nadvected and resuspended coccoliths by oceanic currents and bottom resuspension within the bottom \n\nnepheloid layer (BNL), SAR = sediment accumulation rate, and D = diagenetic phenomena (e.g. \n\ndissolution, recrystallization). The conical shape is meant to schematically represent the area of \n\nproduction (P2) and transport (B2 and PE\u2019) from which a coccolith assemblage preserved in a seafloor \n\nsediment sample may be derived. \n\n \n\nIn the context of a continental margin, the species concentrations (i.e. number of \n\ncoccoliths per gram of sediment) computed from the taphocoenosis is highly dependent on \n\nSAR, which will distort the original thanatocoenosis. Determining the coccolith fluxes \n\n(nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) from a constant sedimentation rate may eliminate this problem. However, \n\ncurrent radiometric methods commonly used for determining sediment accumulation rates in \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\n160 \n\ncontinental margin settings provide only averages over decadal to centennial periods of time, \n\nlacking desired finer resolution. In addition to that, effects of bioturbation can often not be \n\naccounted for in the calculation of sediment accumulation rate, leading to considerable errors \n\nespecially in slowly-accumulating sediments from open continental slopes (see Carpenter et al., \n\n1982; Fuller et al., 1999; Boer et al., 2006). \n\nOn the other hand, in regions of high SAR\u2019s such as submarine canyons (De Stigter et al., \n\n2007; 2011) coccolith fluxes derived from present day productivity (i.e. PEs) end up mixed with \n\nresuspended/reworked coccoliths (PE\u2019), due to the fact that these major submarine valleys often \n\nact as morphological traps for fine particles in transit along the shelf. \n\nDetermining species relative abundance in percentage relative to the sum of total or \n\nselected common coccoliths is a standard analytical procedure to eliminate the effect of the \n\n(common) factors that indiscriminately act upon P, thus allowing to infer species\u2019 ecological \n\ninter-relationships independently of sediment dilution effects and/or effects of bottom dynamics. \n\nIt is thereby assumed that all taphonomical processes affect all coccolithophore species of \n\nsimilar size (? 3\u00b5m) equally. This way, only the original PEs and PE\u2019 signals will remain.  \n\nNevertheless, the closure problem and the inconsistency of determining percentages may \n\nlead to spurious correlations and biased statistical analysis; according to Pawlowsky-Glahn and \n\nEgozcue (2006), using percentage values leads to inconsistent and spurious relations between \n\nthe parts and, thus, to potentially unrealistic interpretations (i.e. changing the number of \n\ncomponents leads to different relationships among them). There are cases where it is possible to \n\nobtain similar results, especially when the sub-compositions are nearly constant/homogeneous, \n\nalthough one cannot assure that it will be so in advance.  \n\nCompositional Data Analysis (CoDA) (Buccianti and Esposito, 2004; Pawlowsky-Glahn \n\nand Egozcue, 2006) was designed to provide robust results, since the inferences made on the \n\ncoccoliths assemblage is based on a theoretical approach that provides tools that allow to extract \n\nrelative information while satisfying scale invariance, subcompositional coherence and \n\npermutation invariance. By implementing the use of isometric log-ratios, CoDA makes the \n\ntreatment of two variables, or groups of variables, symmetric, given that Log (x/y) = - Log \n\n(y/x). Such symmetry is essential to avoid spurious correlations by giving them \n\nsubcompositional coherence, and thus leading to more reliable comparisons and interpretations.  \n\nHere, CoDA is applied to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores from the central \n\nPortuguese margin. The isometric log-ratio (ilr) approach was applied to previously reported \n\ncoccolith assemblage data from superficial sediments collected along the Nazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal canyons and adjacent shelf and slope regions (Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; Chapter 4), \n\nto validate the robustness of ecological inferences based on percentages. The goals of the \n\npresent work are: (1) to confirm the effect of submarine canyons on the (paleo)ecology of \n\ncoccolithophores, (2) to extract the ecological signal, independent from the intensified \n\ntaphonomical effects in these regions (i.e. PE\u2019 and SAR), and (3) to introduce the isometric log-\n\nratio as a procedure to validate and obtain consistent (paleo)ecological interpretations. Results \n\nobtained from both compositional (CODA) and classical approaches are compared and \n\ndiscussed. \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n\n161 \n\n5.2. General principles behind Compositional Data Analysis \n\nCompositional data are data in which the components represent \u201cparts of a whole\u201d. They \n\ncarry only relative information between parts, and are usually represented as percentages or \n\nppm; in this case, their sum corresponds to a constant, typically 100% or 10\n6\n (Parent et al., \n\n2012). Because of this, compositional data are an easy target of spurious correlations and \n\nsubcompositional incoherence that typically affect all data that measures parts of the same \n\nwhole. An example: considering an ecological subsystem composed of a few selected species \n\n(sp1, sp2, sp3,\u2026) the behaviour of any two components will randomly change their signs and \n\nmeanings depending on the other components involved, leading to the so-called \u201cspurious \n\ncorrelation problem\u201d or subcompositional incoherence (Pearson, 1897; Tolosana-Delgado, \n\n2012; Buccianti, 2013). Ideally, results should not depend on whether we take one, some, or all \n\nof our components or species, neither on whether we scale them up and down by arbitrary \n\nnumbers, nor even whether we choose our samples to sum up to 100% or leave them untouched \n\n(Aitchison, 1997). To avoid these problems, a \u201cscale or scaling invariance\u201d property should be \n\ninherent to the methods applied when studying compositional data. Such property is assured by \n\nusing the ratios between the components instead of their individual variation, based on the \n\npremise that one cannot assess absolute increase or decrease of the components, but only \n\nrelative changes (Aitchison et al., 2000). \n\nDespite these facts, most of the quantitative analyses performed by geoscientists all over \n\nthe world do not take into account the particular features of compositional data. Although \n\nsimilar results may be achieved from both classical and compositional approaches, depending \n\non where the data are located within the sample space or simplex (i.e. if they are close to the \n\ncentre or to the borders), it is up to now not possible to know the weight of this effect a priori, \n\nor how to measure it. Therefore, part of the information about compositional natural systems \n\nmay become completely lost or misunderstood (Buccianti, 2013). \n\nCompositional Data Analysis (CoDA) is a set of statistical tools and geometric concepts \n\nbuilt with the purpose of allowing results to satisfy scale invariance and subcompositional \n\ncoherence, based on the idea that we can only assess relative changes between components \n\n(Aitchison, 1997). It requires transformation of compositional data located in the constrained \n\nspace (the simplex) before performing statistical analysis, in order to move them into real space, \n\nthus allowing the inference about the sample features, from which the data are drawn, to be \n\nconsistently performed from a theoretical point of view (Aitchison, 1982; Buccianti and \n\nEsposito, 2004). By avoiding spurious correlations and negative bias, the log-ratio approach \n\npermits obtaining an exhaustive understanding on how natural phenomena work, and to extract \n\nall the information contained in data variability (Buccianti, 2013). \n\nGiven the Euclidean space nature of the simplex (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2001), \n\nrepresenting compositions by their coordinates in the simplex has an enormous potential.  A \n\nsuitable orthonormal basis for this purpose is obtained through an isometric log-ratio \n\ntransformation (Egozcue et al., 2003). The advantage of such a transformation is that, as a result \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\n162 \n\nof orthogonality, the original information is preserved (Parent et al., 2012), i.e. the distance \n\nbetween two observations before and after the transformation is the same. \n\nTo obtain an interpretable isometric transformation and provide the geometry required to \n\nanalyse data in Euclidean space, Egozcue et al. (2003) and Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn \n\n(2005a) arranged the D parts of a composition in a D-1 sequential binary partition (SBP), which \n\nleads to an orthonormal basis. A SBP is a hierarchical grouping of parts of the original \n\ncompositional vector, starting with the whole composition as a group and ending with each part \n\nin a single group (Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2005a). This partition can be selected by the \n\nuser in order to enable the best interpretation of the results when some kind of relation between \n\nparts is a priori known or preferred (Thi\u00f3-Henestrosa et al., 2008). The D-1 isometric log-ratio \n\n(ilr) coordinates are data transformations mapped according to the SBP and computed as \n\ncontrasts/balances between two groups (tagged with + and \u2013 signals) (Parent et al., 2012). Such \n\nbalances reflect the relative variation of two groups of parts, i.e. the isometric log-ratios of \n\ngeometric means of groups of parts (see Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2005a). \n\nThe balance-dendrogram is a new methodology within CoDA aimed to explore and \n\ndescribe compositional data in a coherent geometry, particularly useful to summarize and to \n\ngraphically describe a composition of many parts. It allows the visualization of the partition \n\nused and, for each balance, the sample mean or centre, the proportion of the sample total \n\nvariance corresponding to it, and summary statistics represented by the boxplot of percentiles 5, \n\n25, 50, 75 and 95 (see Thi\u00f3-Henestrosa et al., 2008). A more complete description of the \n\nelements of the balance-dendrogram is presented by Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn (2005b) \n\nand Thi\u00f3-Henestrosa et al. (2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3. Regional setting \n\nThe central Portuguese margin has a relatively narrow shelf (20\u201350 km wide and a \n\ngradient of&lt;1\u00b0), passing into a steep irregular slope (6\u20137\u00b0) below the shelf-break which is \n\nlocated at 160-200 m depth. The shelf is composed of thick Cenozoic carbonate and detritic \n\nformations, filling structural basins formed during earlier rifting phases. The margin is dissected \n\nby a number of long submarine canyons, of which the Nazar\u00e9 and Set\u00fabal\u2013Lisbon canyons are \n\nthe most remarkable (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Mougenot, 1989; Alves et al., 2003) \n\n(Figure 5.2). \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon stands out for being one of the largest and steepest canyons of the \n\nEuropean margin, cutting across the full width of the Portuguese central margin almost to the \n\ncoastline. The canyon starts at ~50 m water depth and within 1 km from Nazar\u00e9 Bay, and \n\nextends to the Iberian Abyssal plain, 211 km off the canyon head. This canyon is presently not \n\nconnected to a major modern drainage system, and obtains its sediment input by capture of \n\nparticles transported by littoral drift (Duarte et al., 2000) and along the shelf (Oliveira et al., \n\n2007; De Stigter et al., 2007). Tidal currents actively resuspend and transport sediment in the \n\nupper-middle canyon, as reflected by high concentrations of suspended particles in bottom \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n\n163 \n\nwaters, high horizontal and vertical sediment fluxes in the bottom water layer, and high \n\nsediment accumulation rates on the seabed (De Stigter et al., 2007). Sediment accumulated in \n\nthe canyon head and upper section is remobilized and flushed to its lower section and adjacent \n\nabyssal plain by intermittent sediment gravity flows occurring mostly during autumn and winter \n\nmonths (De Stigter et al., 2007; Mart\u00edn et al., 2011; Masson et al., 2011).  \n\nThe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon has a more complex morphology, fed by two main branches: \n\nthe E-W oriented Set\u00fabal branch and the N-S trending Lisbon branch. Like the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, \n\nthe latter is deeply incised into the continental shelf and slope, and extends down to the abyssal \n\nplain at depths > 4800 m. Different from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, however, the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon heads, located in somewhat deeper water  a few km off the coast, are connected with \n\ntwo major river systems, i.e. Tagus and Sado rivers (at 120 and 90 m depth, and at 20 and 13 \n\nkm off the river mouths, for the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal branches, respectively (see Lastras et al., \n\n2009). Recent findings of De Stigter et al. (2011) indicate that the Lisbon Set\u00fabal-Canyon is \n\npresently nearly inactive in terms of down-canyon sediment transport, probably due to the \n\npresence of an overall up-canyon direction of net water transport, leading the particles to settle \n\nin the upper canyon towards the canyon head rather than disperse them down-canyon, and the \n\napparent rareness of sediment gravity flows, which in other canyon systems (e.g. Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon) are the dominant mechanism of down-canyon dispersal. Fine-grained predominantly \n\nlithogenic particles from the adjacent shelf areas accumulate in their upper reaches, whereas the \n\nsediment deposited further down in the middle and lower canyon reaches is essentially \n\nhemipelagic, similar to the sediment found on the adjacent continental slope.  \n\nCirculation over the Portuguese shelf and upper slope displays a marked seasonal \n\nvariation associated with seasonal shifts in the position of the Azores high and Iceland low \n\npressure systems (e.g. Haynes et al., 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007). During summer, \n\nthe Azores high migrates towards the central Atlantic, typically inducing Trade Winds to \n\nbecome northerly, inducing an equatorward circulation over the upper 150-200 m of the water \n\ncolumn off Portugal. Under such conditions, the surface layer of about 30 m thick of relatively \n\nwarmer and lighter water is swept offshore by Ekman transport, allowing colder, less salty and \n\nnutrient enriched subsurface water to rise to the surface along the coast (e.g. Fi\u00faza, 1983; \n\nHaynes et al. 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2011). During winter, the \n\nIceland low intensifies and the dominant wind regime becomes southerly along the western \n\nPortuguese margin. This induces the IPC to rise over the upper slope and shelf, where the \n\npoleward flow produces an onshore Ekman transport, in turn resulting in downwelling \n\nconditions over the shelf (Fi\u00faza, 1983; Vitorino et al., 2002).  \n\nThe upper 500 m of water column off Portugal, including the surface mixed layer and the \n\nfirst thermocline, is constituted by the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW). This \n\nwater mass, representing the main source of nutrient-rich waters upwelling along the Portuguese \n\ncoast, shows considerable variation in its hydrological features as it travels along the coast \n\n(Fi\u00faza, 1984; McCave and Hall, 2002). The ENACW has two main components of different \n\norigin, converging to this region: a lighter, relatively warm and salty subtropical branch \n\n(ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually loses its characteristics as it \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\n164 \n\ntravels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline colder water mass of subpolar \n\norigin (ENACWsp) slowly flowing southwards below the poleward subtropical branch, related \n\nwith the Subpolar Mode Water formed in the eastern North Atlantic by winter cooling and deep \n\nconvection (Fi\u00faza et al., 1998). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - Geographical location of the central Portuguese margin.

Material and Methodology \n\n5.4.1. Cruises and surface sediment sampling \n\nThe sediment samples used in this study were recovered during several cruises with RV \n\nPelagia of Royal NIOZ, held in November 2002, October 2003, April/May 2004, May 2005, \n\nSeptember 2006 and March 2011 in the central Portuguese margin (cruises 64PE204, 64PE218, \n\n64PE225, 64PE236, 64PE252 and 64PE332, respectively). \n\nSurface samples were collected with equipment and methodology as described in De \n\nStigter et al. (2007, 2011). Samples corresponding to the top 0.5 or 1 cm of box- and multicores \n\nwere sub-sampled and analysed to determine the recent coccolith assemblages. Sediment coring \n\nwas concentrated on six transects crossing the central Portuguese margin in an approximately E-\n\nW direction, aiming to represent the gradients coast versus ocean and canyons versus adjacent \n\nshelf and slope: (1) three transects along the axis of the Nazar\u00e9, Lisbon-Set\u00fabal and Cascais \n\ncanyons; (2) three transects covering the shelf and open continental slope off Cape Mondego, \n\nEstremadura spur and off Cape Sines. Coring positions are shown in Figure 5.2 and listed in \n\nAppendix D. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4.2. Laboratory and microscope analysis \n\nFor the study of the fossil record of coccolithophores, 89 surface sediment samples were \n\nanalysed. Slides were prepared following the random settling procedure (Flores and Sierro, \n\n1997) and observed under optical polarizing microscope (Olympus BX-40), at 1250\u00d7 \n\nmagnification. A minimum of 300 individual coccoliths (i.e. \u201cnanno\u201d for short) was counted \n\nand identified in each slide to determine their concentration (nanno/g), according to the \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n  \n\n \nW\n\n1\n\nOa\n\nPa\n\nVp\n\nV\nnN ????                                                                        (6) \n\n \n\nwhere, N = nanno/g, n = number of counted coccoliths, V = volume within the glass bottle \n\n(10000 \u00b5l), Vp = volume pipetted and injected into the Petri dish, Pa = Petri dish area, Oa = \n\nobserved area (obtained by the number of vision fields, VF, at the microscope, multiplied by the \n\nunit area corresponding to the microscope; 1 VF Olympus BX-40 = 0.02 mm\n2\n), and W = weight \n\nof the sediment sample. The numbers of coccoliths per gram of sediment will be generally \n\nreferred to as \u201ccoccolith concentrations\u201d throughout the text, to distinguish them from the \n\n\u201crelative abundances\u201d calculated relative to the sum of common coccoliths. \n\nAt each sampling point, coccolith fluxes (nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) were determined by multiplying \n\nthe coccolith concentrations by sediment accumulation rates (SAR), previously calculated from \n\nsediment profiles of \n210\n\nPb (22.2 years half-life (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; Guerreiro et al., \n\nsubmitted-b, Chapter 4).  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\n166 \n\nTo minimize effects of differential dissolution, only the larger and more robust taxa (? 3 \n\n\u00b5m) were considered. Nine coccolithophore taxa were selected for this study: Calcidiscus \n\nleptoporus (Cl), Coronosphaera mediterranea (Cm), Coccolithus pelagicus s.l.

Statistical analysis: compositional and classical approaches \n\nThe isometric log-ratios (ilr) (Egozcue et al., 2003) were determined from the coccolith \n\nconcentrations (nanno/g) and made by taking rigorously into account the sample space of \n\ncompositional data (i.e. data matrices whose rows sum to 100%). Six compositional balances \n\n(?) were determined by applying a sequential binary partition (SBP) to the seven taxonomic \n\ngroups, based on our pre-acquired knowledge of their ecological preferences and on the results \n\nfrom percentages (e.g. Winter et al., 1994; Cach\u00e3o and Moita, 2000; Cach\u00e3o et al., 2000; Silva \n\net al., 2008; Guerreiro et al., submitted-b, Chapter 4), determined according to: ? 7 taxa (%) = \n\nCl (%) + Cm (%) + Cp (%) + Gm (%) + Go (%) + Hc (%) + UUR (%) = 100 %. The SBP was \n\nperformed by taking the whole group (7 taxa) and dividing it into two groups (here 4 neritic-\n\ncoastal taxa vs. 3 oceanic taxa). The resulting balance (?1) reflects the (geometric) mean \n\nbehaviour of the first group vs. the (geometric) mean behaviour of the second group.

Boxplots representing the distribution of the isometric log-\n\nratios (ilr) in water depth (m) were also built for the five studied sectors. \n\n \n\n5.5. Results  \n\n5.5.1. Classical approaches: nanno/g, coccolith fluxes and percentages  \n\nData of coccolith total counts, concentrations (nanno/g), fluxes (nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) and \n\nrelative abundances (%) determined from the studied sediment samples are listed in the \n\nAppendix D. With the exception of the coccolith fluxes, results presented in this section have \n\nbeen previously discussed in Guerreiro et al. (submitted-b) (see Chapter 4) and, therefore, only a \n\ngeneral overview of the coast to ocean distribution of coccolith species is shown.  \n\nA general decrease of coccolith concentrations (nanno/g) towards the coastline is visible \n\nfrom the plots of the seven taxonomic groups, especially in the case of Cl. Such W\u2013E \n\ndecreasing gradient is particularly evident along the ocean-coast transects adjacent to the \n\nsubmarine canyons, whereas all taxa display higher nanno/g values in the upper sections of the \n\ncanyons in comparison to the adjacent coastal regions, particularly in the upper Lisbon-Set\u00fabal \n\nCanyon (Figure 5.3).  \n\nCoccolith fluxes (nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) determined from SAR\u2019s were highest at the central part \n\nof the investigated region, with a maximum value in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head, where several \n\ncoccolith species recorded a peak in flux. Indeed, a clear distinction between the submarine \n\ncanyons and the adjacent coastal regions is noticed close to coast: higher coccolith fluxes are \n\nrecorded in the upper reaches of the canyons, particularly in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, whereas rather \n\nlow fluxes are noticed in the adjacent regions, for comparable distances to the coast. Cp, Gm, \n\nGo and Hc recorded their highest coccolith fluxes in the upper reaches of the canyons, \n\nparticularly in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Figures 5.3c-f). Cl and UUR recorded similar values of \n\ncoccolith fluxes in both studied canyons (Figure 5.3a, g). Further offshore, generally low \n\ncoccolith fluxes were obtained, except on the open slope of Estremadura spur. Most of the \n\nspecies recorded an increase of coccolith flux in this region, but it was most pronounced for the \n\noceanic taxa Cl, Gm and UUR (Figures 5.3a, d, g). \n\nSpecies relative abundances also show a clear W-E gradient, in this case revealing \n\ndifferences among the taxa. An increase in percentage of the neritic-coastal species Cm, Go and \n\nHc towards the coast is clearly recorded, with Cm and Hc clearly more abundant in Nazar\u00e9  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 Coccolith concentrations (nanno/g), fluxes (nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) and percentages plotted against distance to coast (km): (a) Calcidiscus leptoporus, (b) Coronosphaera \n\nmediterranea, (c) Coccolithus pelagicus. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 (cont) \u2013 Coccolith  concentrations (nanno/g), fluxes (nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) and percentages plotted against distance to coast (km): (d) Gephyrocapsa muellerae,                      \n\n(e) Gephyrocapsa oceanica. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 (cont) \u2013 Coccolith  concentrations (nanno/g), fluxes (nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) and percentages plotted against distance to coast (km): (f) Helicosphaera carteri,                     \n\n(g) Umbillicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera irregularis, Rhabdosphaera spp. (UUR) \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n\n171 \n\n whereas Go is more abundant on the Estremadura shelf.

Relatively higher percentages of this species are \n\nnoticed at Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. Gm and UUR display the same general decreasing trend \n\ntowards the coast, although less distinctive than in Cl. Gm has markedly higher relative \n\nabundances in the upper reaches of the canyons in comparison to the adjacent shelf and coast, \n\nparticularly in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon. Higher proportions of coccoliths from oceanic taxa \n\nare noticed at the upper Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, whereas the coccoliths from coastal-neritic \n\nspecies are better represented at the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Figure 5.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5.2. CoDA: isometric log-ratios (ilr)  \n\nThe dendrogram represented in Figure 5.4 gives information about the relative \n\nimportance of each (paleo)ecological assemblage (oceanic vs. coastal-neritic) within the \n\ninvestigated sectors. Each balance (?) is represented by a black vertical \"arm\", the length of \n\nwhich is proportional to the variance explained by the balance, if all the samples are considered \n\ntogether, i.e. as one unique sample. The relative weight of each (paleo)ecological signature in \n\nthe different sub-groups of samples (i.e. investigated sectors) is given by the horizontal distance \n\nbetween the box plot and the black vertical \"arm\" corresponding to the centre of the balance, i.e. \n\nthe shorter it is towards the centre of the balance, the heavier is its geometric mean in the data \n\nset. It means that the geometric mean weighs more in that specific group of samples.  \n\nEach sector (assumed to be well represented by a group of samples) is illustrated by a box \n\nplot and a \"vertical arm\" with the same colour, the length of both giving information about the \n\ncompositional variability (i.e. > length = > variability). The position of the vertical \"arm\" in the \n\nbox plot indicates the mean of the balance in that specific sector. The performed SBP, the mean \n\nand variance of each extracted isometric log-ratio (i.e. balance) is represented in Table 5.1. The \n\nilr\u2019s obtained for each sediment sample are listed in the Appendix D. \n\nThe most striking differences between the five sectors shown in the dendrogram are given \n\nby ?1, which discriminates the coastal-neritic from the oceanic taxa, i.e. ?1 represents the \n\n(geometric) mean behaviour of the neritic-coastal group (Cm, Hc, Go and Cp) vs. the \n\n(geometric) mean behaviour of the oceanic group (Gm, UUR and Cl). This first balance \n\nindicates that the oceanic taxa have a higher weight on the studied dataset, as revealed by the \n\nrelatively shorter \u201chorizontal left arm\u201d compared to the corresponding horizontal right arm, i.e. \n\nthe vertical arms are globally positioned closer to the oceanic group.  \n\nWhen comparing the five sectors, the graph clearly shows the relatively stronger relation \n\nof the canyons with the coastal-neritic species, as indicated by the median of their boxplots \n\nwhich is relatively displaced towards the right side of the dendrogram, particularly in the case of \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon. On the contrary, for the shelf and slope regions the median coccolith abundance \n\nis displaced toward the left side of the dendrogram, meaning that in these sectors the oceanic \n\nassemblage has a higher weight.

The Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon and the region west of Cape Sines reveal a slightly higher \u201cweight\u201d of coccoliths from \n\nCm and Hc, whereas the regions west of Cape Mondego, Estremadura spur and the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon reveal a slightly higher \u201cweight\u201d of coccoliths from Go and Cp. ?5 shows the \n\ngreater importance of Gm in comparison to UUR and Cl, as indicated by the shorter \u201carm\u201d that \n\nseparates Gm from the centre of ?5. Gm is more important in the Mondego transect and in the \n\ncanyons in comparison to the Estremadura and Sines transects. \n\nIn order to complement the information given by the balance-dendrogram and to achieve \n\na clearer perception about the spatial distribution of the (paleo)ecological ratios along the five \n\nstudied sections, the ilr\u2019s obtained from the SBP were plotted against distance to coast (Figure \n\n5.5). In analogy to factor scores in classical factor analysis (see Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; \n\nChapter 4), the distribution of ilr\u2019s towards the positive and negative part of the yy axis \n\nindicates the relative importance of the species in the numerator and denominator of each \n\nisometric log-ratio (i.e. balance), respectively, within the studied samples (cases).  \n\nThe balance ?1 clearly reveals a relatively higher importance of oceanic species further \n\noffshore (negative values), whereas the coastal species become more important closer to the \n\ncoast (positive values). A larger number of samples recording ilr values &lt;0 reflects the higher \n\n\u201cweight\u201d of the oceanic assemblage within the study area, most probably due to the remarkable \n\ndominance and broad distribution of Gm. Balance ?1 is more stable further offshore than closer \n\nto the coast (&lt;80 km), i.e. a very stable proportion between coastal and oceanic taxa is noticed \n\nwithin and among the studied sectors offshore (except in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, due to \n\nlack of data for this offshore region), whereas a higher variability is visible towards the coast. \n\nThe positive trend of ?1 towards the coast is more distinct outside the canyons, whereas a higher \n\nvariability of both assemblages is noticed in the upper reaches of the canyons (Figure 5.5a).  \n\nAt comparable (proximal) distances off the coast, a larger number of samples with \n\nnegative ilr\u2019s in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon suggests a higher \u201cweight\u201d of the oceanic group in \n\nILR binary partition: \n\n        \nBalance Cp Hc Cl Go Gm Cm UUR Mean Variance \n\n?1 1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -0.8 1.5 \n\n?2 1 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 0.3 0.2 \n\n?3 1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 -1.4 0.2 \n\n?4 0 1 0 0 0 -1 0 -0.3 0.3 \n\n?5 0 0 1 0 -1 0 1 -2.3 0.4 \n\n?6 0 0 1 0 0 0 -1 0.5 0.4 \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n174 \n\nthis canyon, whereas the larger number of samples with positive ilr\u2019s in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\nindicates a higher \u201cweight\u201d of the coastal-neritic. When comparing the shelf and slope regions \n\nadjacent to the canyons, samples collected off Cape Sines stand out for having ilr\u2019s ? 0 along \n\nthe entire W-E transect, suggesting a more oceanic environment in comparison to the regions \n\noff Cape Mondego and Estremadura spur where a higher \u201cweight\u201d of the coastal-neritic \n\nassemblage is noticed near the coast.  \n\nThe remaining balances (ilr\u2019s) reveal a more uniform lateral distribution in comparison to \n\n?1, although here too a higher stability further offshore is observed, in comparison to increasing \n\nvariability towards the coast. The distribution of ilr\u2019s indicates that among the coastal-neritic \n\ngroup, Go represents the higher weight within the dataset, followed by Cm, Hc and Cp. (Figures \n\n5.5b-d). Outside the canyons, ?2 tends to increase towards the coast revealing a higher \u201cweight\u201d \n\nof Cp and Go in these proximal regions. In contrast, the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon reveals a generally \n\ndecreasing trend along its entire W-E section, with the strongest signal of Hc and Cm recorded \n\nclose to the coast (~20 km). At the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, ?2 stands out for recording a rather \n\nuniform lateral distribution (Figure 5.5b). \n\nAmong the oceanic taxa, Gm displays by far the highest weight in the studied samples, followed \n\nby Cl and UUR. Balance ?5 reveals a strikingly uniform W-E distribution trend in the shelf and \n\nslope regions west of Cape Sines and Estremadura spur, whereas the submarine canyons and the \n\nregion off Cape Mondego reveal a clearly decreasing trend from 60-40 km to the coast (Figure \n\n5.5e). Balance ?6 reveals a quite uniform lateral distribution, although a certain decreasing \n\ntendency is noticed towards the coast, suggesting that Cl is more important further offshore in \n\ncomparison to UUR (Figure 5.5f). \n\nIn Figure 5.6, the box-plots representing the distribution of the six balances with water \n\ndepth (deeper or shallower than 500 m) revealed similar spatial distributions to those from \n\nFigure 5.5. The most striking aspects refer to the distribution of ?1 and ?5, whereas the \n\nremaining balances revealed a quite uniform distribution among the five sectors, at both shallow \n\nand deeper water regions (Figures 5.6a and 5.6e). Higher variability is often noticed for water \n\ndepths lower than 500 m, whereas the deeper regions reveal a more uniform N-S distribution. \n\n?1 reveals a conspicuous mix of both coastal and oceanic taxa at both shallower and \n\ndeeper areas along the canyons, whereas a clear separation between coastal and oceanic taxa is \n\nnoticed on the adjacent shelf and slope regions, at shallower and deeper areas, respectively.  The \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon shows the stronger mixing between the two assemblages and the highest weight \n\nof coastal coccoliths at both water depth ranges (particularly at &lt;500 m), whereas the Lisbon-\n\nSet\u00fabal Canyon has a higher weight of oceanic taxa at both water depth ranges. The coastal \n\ncoccolith assemblage reveals a general N-S decrease of weight at &lt;500 m, whereas the canyons \n\nhave a higher weight of the coastal assemblage at > 500 m, in comparison to the adjacent shelf \n\nand slope regions (Figure 5.6a). \n\n?5 illustrates a general N-S decreasing importance of Gm in the shallower areas, except \n\nin the upper reaches of the canyons where it was more strongly recorded in comparison to the \n\nadjacent shelf and slope regions at comparable water depths. Towards greater depths, an \n\nincrease in importance of Cl and UUR is noticed in all the sectors. ?6 shows almost no \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n175 \n\n \n\nvariability within and among the five studied sectors, with the exception of the Sines transect \n\n(Figure 5.6f). \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 \u2013 Isometric log-ratios (ilr) obtained for the studied set of samples plotted against distance to \n\ncoast (km): (a) ?1 [Cp, Go, Hc, Cm / Cl, UUR, Gm], (b) ?2 [Cp, Go / Hc, Cm], (c) ?3 [Cp / Go], (d) ?4 \n\n[Hc / Cm], (e) ?5 [Cl, UUR / Gm], (f) ?6 [Cl / UUR]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n176 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n \n\n     \n\n \n\n     \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 \u2013 Boxplots representing the distribution of the isometric log-ratios (ilr) in water depth (m), \n\nalong the five studied sectors: (a) ?1 [Cp, Go, Hc, Cm / Cl, UUR, Gm], (b) ?2 [Cp, Go / Hc, Cm], (c) ?3 \n\n[Cp / Go], (d) ?4 [Hc / Cm], (e) ?5 [Cl, UUR / Gm], (f) ?6 [Cl / UUR]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n177 \n\n \n\n5.6. Discussion \n\n5.6.1. (Paleo)ecology of coccolithophores based on isometric log-ratios \n\nResults presented in this study are in good agreement with distribution trends previously \n\nreported by Guerreiro et al. (submitted-b) (see Chapter 4) for this dataset, using factor analysis \n\nwith the taxa percentages: distinct (paleo)ecological N-S and W-E trends were observed \n\nbetween the seven taxonomic groups, and differences were also observed between the \n\nsubmarine canyons and the adjacent shelf and slope regions. \n\nThe relatively higher \u201cweight\u201d of the oceanic assemblage in the studied dataset reflects \n\nthe significant dominance and broad distribution of Gm (Figure 5.4). Of the three oceanic \n\nspecies, Gm seems to be better adapted to more turbulent and nutrient-rich coastal regions. \n\nAlthough this species has been associated to more temperate ecological conditions (Ziveri et al., \n\n2004) and to colder water masses at the onset of upwelling west off Portugal (Silva et al., 2008), \n\nits high abundance and wide distribution in the sedimentary record suggests it has a broad \n\necological tolerance in the central Portuguese margin. The relative enrichment of coccoliths \n\nfrom Gm in the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon may result from up-canyon \n\ntransport of resuspended coccoliths within the benthic boundary layer toward the canyon head \n\n(De Stigter et al., 2011) and/or the preferential onflow of more oceanic water masses through \n\nthe canyons, as has been reported to occur in canyon systems (e.g. Skliris and Djenidi, 2006; \n\nGuerreiro et al, submitted-a; Chapter 3) (Figure 5.4 and 5.5e).  \n\nOn the contrary, Cl and UUR were more persistently associated to more oceanic regions \n\nand therefore may be used as proxies for coccolithophore productivity (P) occurring offshore \n\n(Figures 5.5a and f). The relatively higher weight of Cl and UUR at the southernmost part of the  \n\nstudy area (i.e. west of Cape Sines) and the N\u2013S decreasing importance of the coastal-neritic \n\nassemblage in the shallower areas possibly reflects a stronger influence from ENACW of \n\nsubtropical origin (ENACWst) in this region (Fi\u00faza et al., 1998; Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; \n\nChapter 4). Such subtropical influence will expectedly be stronger during winter when the \n\nIberian Poleward Current advects NEACWst towards the Portuguese coast under downwelling \n\nconditions prevailing during this season (Vitorino et al., 2002). \n\nWhereas the coastal-neritic taxa were preferentially distributed closer to the coast in all \n\nthe five sectors, distinct (paleo)ecological signatures were observed in the canyons and the \n\nadjacent shelf and slope regions at greater water depths, most probably reflecting differences in \n\nterms of oceanographic and bottom sedimentary dynamics. In the canyons, particularly at \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon, higher \u201cweight\u201d of coccoliths from coastal-neritic species, higher mixing \n\nbetween the two assemblages (dispersion) (Figures 5.4, 5.5a, 5.6a) may reflect the capacity of \n\nthe canyons to create nutrient-rich conditions favouring growth of opportunistic species, and to \n\npromote the exchange of water masses from neritic-coastal and oceanic regions (i.e. ecological \n\nsignal). It may also reflect the effect of permanent internal tidal activity resuspending and \n\nremobilizing fine sediments from the canyon seafloor, producing a relatively more \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n178 \n\nhomogeneous sedimentary cover (taphonomical signal, PE\u2019) (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; \n\nGuerreiro et al., submitted-b; Chapter 4).  \n\nOf the five sectors, the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon reveals the highest dispersion and the highest \n\nweight of coastal-neritic coccoliths at >500 m depth, in comparison to the other sectors for the \n\nsame depth range, including the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon (Figure 5.6a). On the one hand, given \n\nthe proximity of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head to the coastline, this major valley is likely able to \n\nadvect living coccolithophores from oceanic to more coastal areas and, at the same time, \n\ninfluencing oceanographic circulation near the coast (i.e. upwelling intensification, internal tidal \n\nactivity), favouring the input of nutrients and thus promoting the development of r-selected \n\nspecies. Chl-a data recently obtained from satellite imagery (2006-2011) suggest that the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon head is the most persistently productive part of the upper-middle canyon (Guerreiro et \n\nal., submitted-a; Chapter 3), supporting this hypothesis. On the other hand, internal tidal activity \n\nand intermittent down-canyon sediment gravity flows in this canyon were observed \n\nredistributing sediments along its entire length (De Stigter et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2011), \n\nwhich probably leads to resuspension and transport of coastal-neritic coccolith species from the \n\nupper canyon reaches toward the middle and lower reaches (Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; \n\nChapter 4). \n\nOn the contrary, the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon head is located further offshore, where it is \n\napparently less affected by coastal dynamics. Representing a calmer environment, this canyon \n\nsystem seems to be mainly trapping particles from vertical flux. The result of this is a relatively \n\nmore pelagic sedimentation (De Stigter et al., 2011) and a (paleo)ecological signature \n\ndominated by coccoliths from oceanic species (Cl, UUR; see Figures 5.3a and 5.3e). A stronger \n\ninfluence of subtropical waters flowing onto this southern part of the central Portuguese margin \n\n(see Fi\u00faza et al., 1998) should be considered to explain these coccolith assemblages. \n\nAll the balances produced by CoDA revealed higher stability further offshore, i.e. the \n\ntaxa within each log ratio displayed very stable proportions along that part of the W-E sections, \n\npossibly reflecting more stable depositional conditions in these deeper regions, away from \n\nlittoral dynamics. Coccoliths will preferentially accumulate in fine-grained hemipelagic deposits \n\nthat accumulate in more quiescent environments of the middle and lower slope, including also \n\nthe lower reaches of the canyons. The resulting (paleo)ecological record expectedly appears \n\n\u201ccleaner\u201d offshore, i.e. less disturbed, mostly derived from vertical coccolith fluxes. On the \n\ncontrary, the increasing variability of the balances towards the coast reflects the increasing \n\neffect of taphonomical processes associated to coastal dynamics, which in the case of the central \n\nPortuguese margin are mostly related to coccolith resuspension and winnowing by waves and \n\ncurrents, rather than dilution with other sedimentary material (Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; \n\nChapter 4). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n179 \n\n \n\n5.6.2 Compositional vs. classical approaches \n\nResults obtained with CoDA are in good agreement with those from conventional \n\nanalysis of species percentages, despite potentially spurious correlations and biased statistical \n\nanalysis associated to the latter. While avoiding the major statistical problems related to the use \n\nof percentages, by providing subcompositional coherence to our dataset, CoDA allowed to \n\nvalidate the existence of two main coccolithophore assemblages \u2013 one of coastal-neritic affinity,  \n\nrepresented by Cm, Hc, Go (and to a lesser extent Cp), and another of oceanic affinity \n\nrepresented by Cl, UUR and Gm. Likewise, the most striking (paleo)ecological differences \n\namong the five studied sectors, i.e. canyons vs. adjacent margins, and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon vs. \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, were revealed by both compositional and classical approaches. The \n\nobtained balance-dendrograms revealed to be particularly efficient, not only in providing \n\nsymmetry between the coccolithophore taxa, and thus leading to more reliable interpretations, \n\nbut also in representing the most important statistical features and relationships between the \n\ntaxa, their degree of dispersion and relative importance within the dataset, and their spatial \n\ndistribution in the study area (Figure 5.4). \n\nThis study suggests that the coccolith (paleo)ecological signal preserved in sediments of \n\nthe central Portuguese margin is robust, despite the strong bottom dynamics prevailing in this \n\nregion, particularly around the submarine canyons. Although similar results as obtained with \n\nilr\u2019s may in some cases also be found by just using percentages, which seems to be the case \n\nwhen the data are located close to the centre of the simplex, i.e. away from the borders, one \n\ncannot be sure of this in advance; in particular, one cannot tell when they \u201care close enough to \n\nthe centre\u201d and, therefore, calibration with CoDA should be a basic requirement. Results \n\nsuggest that combining the two approaches might be the best option in order to take full \n\nadvantage of the data set: determining the species percentages may serve as a \u201cpreview\u201d of the \n\ndata and the species relative abundances, and providing leads for the SBP, whereas using CoDA \n\nis fundamental to validate and confirm the results in a consistent framework, and to assure that \n\nall the information contained in the data set is being extracted and correctly interpreted. \n\nDespite the robust spatial trends revealed by the percentages, and confirmed by CoDA, \n\nresults from regression tests revealed that there is only a weak or no linear dependence at all \n\nbetween the balances and the distance to the coast. This suggests that the current data set, or the \n\nstudy region itself, contains greater ecological and taphonomical complexity than can be \n\nresolved by basic statistical models. Further exploration of this matter is beyond the scope of the \n\npresent paper, and is left as an open line for future research. \n\nDistribution patterns observed in coccolith concentrations (nanno/g) and fluxes \n\n(nanno/cm\n2\n/yr) appear to be dominated by taphonomical effects, masking the (paleo)ecological \n\nsignal from the fossil record; a general decrease of nanno/g of all taxa towards the coast is \n\nmostly reflecting the increase of near-bottom sedimentary dynamics towards the coast; \n\nenhanced coccolith concentrations and fluxes in the upper canyon reaches may result from \n\nenhanced coccolithophore production in the overlying photic layer (e.g. intensification of \n\nupwelling) (ecological signal - vertical flux; Mendes et al., 2011; Guerreiro et al., submitted-a; \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n180 \n\nChapter 3) and/or from lateral transport of coccoliths and deposition in fine-grained canyon \n\nsediments (biostratonomical signal \u2013 lateral flux) (e.g. Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., \n\n2007). Given that all the taxa revealed this trend more or less equally, the second hypothesis \n\nmay be the most feasible.  \n\nAs previously mentioned, fluxes should be carefully considered since they only take into \n\naccount the effect of dilution with other particles (i.e. variations in SAR), but not the effect of \n\nother taphonomical processes, such as lateral transport, resuspension and diagenesis. This is \n\nparticularly true for the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, which has been reported to act as a \n\nmorphological trap for fine sediments in transit along the coast and shelf, and the stage of \n\nrecurrent resuspension phenomena driven from intensified internal tidal activity (De Stigter et \n\nal., 2007, 2011; Oliveira et al., 2007). Likewise, one cannot be sure that enhanced coccolith \n\nfluxes of all taxa on the open slope of Estremadura spur reflect favourable conditions for \n\nphytoplankton production in this region or just overestimation of SAR due to bioturbation not \n\naccounted for in the calculation of SAR. \n\nResults suggest that sedimentary/taphonomic factors equally affect all the seven \n\ntaxonomic groups, masking their ecological inter-relationship. Therefore, using coccolith \n\nspecies concentrations and fluxes determined from SAR appears to enhance the taphonomic \n\neffects over the ecological signal and, thus, might not be the best approach when investigating \n\nthe (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores from coastal-neritic-oceanic sections, particularly in the \n\ncontext of submarine canyons (Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; Chapter 4)  Nevertheless, the two \n\nmeasures might be a useful indicator for coccolithophore productivity and/or terrigenous \n\nsediment starvation, and for hydrodynamic conditions over a continental margin.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.7. Conclusions \n\nWhile avoiding the major statistical problems of dealing with percentages, CoDA allowed \n\nto validate the existence of a coastal-neritic (Hc, Go and Cp) and an oceanic assemblage (Gm, \n\nCl, UUR), with the latter revealing a relatively higher \u201cweight\u201d in the studied dataset. This \n\nreflects the remarkable dominance and broad distribution of Gm in the entire investigated \n\nregion, suggesting this species is better adapted to more turbulent and nutrient-rich coastal \n\nregions in comparison to other oceanic taxa such as Cl and UUR.  \n\nRelatively stronger mixing of the two coccolithophore assemblages in the canyons, in \n\ncomparison to the adjacent shelf and slope regions, is interpreted as reflecting the role of these \n\nmajor submarine valleys in exchanging water masses between coastal and oceanic regions \n\nand/or the important role of internal tides and sediment gravity flows in \n\nresuspending/transporting particles from the upper canyon reaches down to their middle and \n\nlower reaches, leading to a more homogenised sedimentary and (paleo)ecological record. The \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon revealed the broadest range in (paleo)ecological signature and the highest \n\n\u201cweight\u201d of coastal-neritic coccoliths, both in shallower and deeper regions. This seems to \n\nindicate, on the one hand, higher nutrient availability in this area resulting from the proximity of \n\n\n\n(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores \n\n \n181 \n\n \n\nthe canyon head to the coast and the associated intensification of upwelling, and stronger \n\ninternal tidal activity in the upper canyon; on the other hand, it may be reflecting enhanced \n\nexchange of water masses between coastal and oceanic regions occurrung along this major \n\nsubmarine canyon, involving the advection of living coccolithophores from oceanic to more \n\ncoastal areas in the upper water masses, whereas coccoliths produced by coastal-neritic species \n\nin the upper canyon reaches may be transported down-canyon by internal tides and turbidity \n\ncurrents acting along the bottom of the canyon. \n\nOn the contrary, the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon reveals a (paleo)ecological signature richer \n\nin coccoliths from oceanic species (Cl, UUR), probably reflecting the more offshore position of \n\nthe canyon heads, and thus representing a more stable environment mainly trapping particles \n\nfrom vertical flux. Higher weight of Gm in the upper reaches of the canyons, in comparison to \n\nthe adjacent coastal areas, suggests this species is tracing the up-canyon flow of resuspended \n\ncoccoliths from the benthic layer to the canyon head and/or the preferential onflow of more \n\noceanic water masses through the canyons. Higher weight of the oceanic assemblage in the \n\nsouthern part of the study area appears to be tracing a stronger influence of ENACWst, whereas \n\na higher weight of Gm in the northern part may be tracing a stronger influence of ENACWsp in \n\nthis area. \n\nUsing the species concentrations and the coccolith fluxes determined from SAR appears \n\nto enhance the taphonomic effects over the ecological signal, and therefore, might not be the \n\nbest approach when investigating the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores along coast to ocean \n\nsections, particularly in the context of a continental margin dissected by submarine canyons. \n\nEnhanced coccolith concentrations and fluxes of all taxa in the upper canyon reaches appears to \n\nresult mostly from lateral transport of coccoliths and deposition within these morphological \n\ntraps along with fine\u2013grained sediment in transit along the shelf. \n\nResults obtained with isometric log ratio coordinates are in good agreement with results \n\nobtained using species percentages, despite potentially spurious correlations and biased \n\nstatistical analysis associated to percentage determinations. This suggests that the coccolith \n\n(paleo)ecological signal preserved in sediments of the central Portuguese margin is robust, even \n\nin the context of the highly dynamic submarine canyons. Nevertheless, calibration with ilr\u2019s \n\nshould be a basic requirement since it cannot be sure in advance that use of percentage data will \n\nproduce reliable results. Combining the two approaches should be the best compromise to take \n\nthe best of our data set: determining the species percentages provides a \u201cpreview\u201d of the data \n\nand provides the basis for the SBP, whereas CoDA appears as a fundamental tool to validate \n\nand corroborate the obtained ecological signals, and to assure that all the information contained \n\nin the data set is being extracted and correctly understood. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n182 \n\nAcknowledgements - This work was funded by HERMES (GOCE-CT-2005-511234) and Cd Tox-CoN \n\n(FCT-PTDC/MAR/102800/2008) projects.

Synthesis \n\nThe central Portuguese margin represents a complex and diversified region in terms of \n\noceanography, bottom topography and sedimentary dynamics. Currents and water masses of \n\ndistinct origins, with different hydrological and ecological characteristics, converge into this \n\narea and seasonal variation in shelf-slope circulation is modulated by seasonal shifts in the \n\nposition of the Azores high and Iceland low pressure systems, resulting in alternating upwelling \n\nand downwelling along the coast. The two major submarine canyons extending from near the \n\nshore to abyssal depth, focusing geostrophical currents and oceanic water masses, and \n\namplifying tidal and wind-forced currents, are expected to enhance vertical water transport and \n\nexchange between coastal and oceanic regions, potentially providing a nutrient source for local \n\nphytoplankton development. Phytoplankton assemblages characteristic of the canyon setting \n\nmay be preserved in sediments accumulating within the canyons and adjacentshelf and slope, \n\nbut high terrigenous sediment input and strong bottom water dynamics are expected to \n\nsignificantly dilute and disturb the (paleo)ecological signal. Extracting the ecological signal \n\nfrom the sedimentary record, which particularly in the context of submarine canyons is prone to \n\ntaphonomical bias, represents a major challenge for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The \n\npresent thesis presents a first attempt to address this challenge, on the basis of coccolithophores \n\nand recent coccoliths collected from the central Portuguese margin. Relevant issues discussed in \n\nthe various chapters of the thesis include the present day ecology and distribution of \n\ncoccolithophores in the central Portuguese margin (Chapters 2 and 4), effects of the central \n\nPortuguese canyons on the ecology of coccolithophores living in the overlying surface waters, \n\nand the potential of this group as tracer for canyon processes (Chapters 3 and 4), the dichotomy \n\nbetween taphonomy and ecology of coccolithophores from coastal settings (Chapters 4 and 5) \n\nand statistical approaches to perform more consistent (paleo)ecological interpretations while \n\navoiding the statistical problems associated with the use of percentages (Chapter 5). \n\n \n\n \n\nEcology and distribution of coccolithophores offshore Portugal \n\nWhereas the general biogeography and habitat characteristics of coccolithophores are \n\nrelatively well-described from plankton and bottom sediment surveys, the effects of local \n\nphenomena such as coastal currents, gyres, eddies, upwelling and river runoff are often less \n\nwell-known. More regional studies are required to calibrate the specific local ecological \n\ntolerances of this group, and to evaluate their potential for local paleoceanographic \n\nreconstructions. Results presented in this thesis contribute to fill this gap, using the living \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\n186 \n\ncoccolithophores and sediment coccolith assemblages recorded from the central Portuguese \n\nmargin.  \n\nWhereas coccolithophores are often considered as a typical open ocean phytoplankton \n\ngroup, due to their greater species diversity and numerical contribution to open ocean \n\nphytoplankton communities  (e.g. McIntyre and B\u00e9, 1967; Winter et al., 1994; Brand, 1994; \n\nZiveri et al., 2004), coccolithophores were found in high concentrations in coastal waters of the \n\ncentral Portuguese margin, exhibiting an ecological gradient from K-selected species prevailing \n\nfurther offshore to r-selected species occurring in higher numbers in more coastal-neritic areas. \n\nResults from the cruise in late winter 2010 reported in Chapter 2 provide a remarkable snap-shot \n\nview on the capacity of phytoplankton to rapidly respond to favourable nutrient and light \n\nconditions resulting from short-term regional meteorological and hydrographic variability \n\nWhereas surface water phytopigment data collected during this event indicate that diatoms were \n\nthe dominant phytoplankton group and the main contributor of Chl-a production (data not \n\nshown), rapid exhaustion of silica by diatoms apparently worked in favour of coccolithophores \n\nwhich could profit from nitrates and phosphorus still available at the surface (Figures 2.6-2.7). \n\nIn fact, whereas nutrient depletion from coastal waters is usually attributed to diatoms and some \n\nopportunistic dinoflagellate species (Moita, 2001; Mendes et al., 2011), the significant increase \n\nof coccolithophore cell densities observed off central Portugal in March 2010 indicates that this \n\ngroup can also take advantage of intermittent nutrient replenishment (Figure 2.5). Emiliania \n\nhuxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica were the key players of the coccolithophore bloom \n\nobserved during the high-productive period of the cruise, showing a particularly rapid response \n\nto nutrient input and improved light conditions.  These two species were able to compete with \n\nopportunistic small-chain diatoms, as revealed by their drastic increase of cell densities in the \n\ncoastal region off Cape Carvoeiro, together with Chaetoceros s.l., Thalassiosira s.l, \n\nSkeletonema s.l., clearly confirming their role as early succession r-selected taxa, capable of \n\nrapid growth within nutrient-rich environments (Margalef, 1978). \n\nWhereas E. huxleyi did not reveal any clear distribution trend in the sediment, most likely \n\nreflecting the effects of early-diagenesis on its small-sized coccoliths closer to the coast, the \n\ncoastal affinity of G. oceanica was distinctly reflected in sediments from the central Portuguese \n\nmargin, particularly south of the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, where this species dominated the coccolith \n\nassemblage (Figures 4.4e and 6.1). Given its rapid response to nutrient input observed off Cape \n\nCarvoeiro, its dominance in sediments from around this area suggests that the Estremadura Spur \n\nshelf is the stage of more or less persistent high productivity. Interpretation of G. oceanica as a \n\ngood (paleo)ecological proxy for enhanced productivity near the coast is in agreement with \n\nprevious studies reporting the coastal ecological preference of this species (Silva et al., 2008) \n\nand its ability to quickly respond to nutrient input (Winter et al., 1994; Giraudeau and Bailey, \n\n1995; Broerse et al., 2000; Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Sprengel et al., 2002; Andruleit et al., \n\n2003). \n\nCoronosphaera mediterranea was also able to profit from favourable nutrient conditions, \n\nalthough less prominently than E. huxleyi and G. oceanica, and more displaced towards the \n\nshelf-break region (Figures 2.8-2.11). High cell densities in the upper water masses of the \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Future Work \n\n \n\n187 \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon head correspond well with highest coccolith percentages in the \n\nunderlying sediments, suggesting persistently favourable conditions for C. mediterranea in this \n\nproximal part of the canyon (Figure 4.4b). Results confirm previous observations from Moita et \n\nal. (2010) reporting the significant occurrence of this species close to the coast off Nazar\u00e9 \n\nduring winter.  \n\nHelicosphaera carteri also exhibited a preference for more coastal environments, \n\ncorrelating positively with the afore-mentioned high-productivity species during the 2\nnd\n\n leg of \n\nthe cruise, and displaying a markedly coastal distribution within the sediment (Figures 2.11a \n\nand 4.4f). Results are in agreement with an earlier study from Guerreiro et al. (2005) reporting \n\nan extremely high percentage of H. carteri (~85 %) in sediments from the mouth of the Douro \n\nestuary, interpreted as reflecting an opportunistic behaviour possibly related with locally \n\nconfined nutrient-rich conditions.  \n\nOn the oceanic side, Syracosphaera spp. (dominated by S. marginoporata) and Ophiaster \n\nspp. (with slightly higher densities of O. hydroideus) were the most consistently oligotrophic \n\ntaxa observed in the upper photic layer during both low- and high-productive periods. Closer to \n\nthe coast, the two taxa displayed a broad vertical distribution extending well below the nutrient-\n\nrich surface layer, revealing their ability to compete with E. huxleyi in the subsurface layer in \n\nthese near-shore areas (Figures 2.9-2.11). This suggests that lower light and nutrient levels \n\npresent in subsurface shelf waters were less limiting for these taxa than for E. huxleyi.  \n\nThe near absence of coccoliths from Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. in the \n\nsediment, even in the most offshore stations, most likely reflects the lower resistance of their \n\nsmaller sized-coccoliths to the effects of both biostratonomy and early-diagenesis. Instead, \n\nlarger and more robust coccoliths from Calcidiscus leptoporus were consistently better \n\nrepresented further offshore, indicating the stronger affinity of this species for more oceanic-\n\noligotrophic environments and its greater resistance to dissolution and breakage in comparison \n\nto the two former groups (Figure 4.4a and 6.1). C. leptoporus may therefore be considered a \n\ngood proxy for coccolithophore production occurring further offshore, which is in good \n\nagreement with earlier studies reporting this species as a winter-species in Lisbon bay, tracing \n\nthe advection of subtropical oceanic waters to this region (Silva et al., 2008) and, in a larger \n\nscale, associated to oceanic-oligotrophic environments, preferentially occurring within oceanic \n\ngyre centers (Ziveri et al., 2004).  \n\nGephyrocapsa ericsonii and Gephyrocapsa muellerae revealed apparently similar \n\necological preferences during the plankton cruise, decreasing in cell densities in shelf and upper \n\nslope waters during the high-productive period, but increasing in the most offshore waters \n\nwhere E. huxleyi was not significantly developing (Figure 2.11). G. muellerae was one of the \n\nmost abundant placolith-bearing taxa (?3 \u00b5m) during the low-productive period, next to E. \n\nhuxleyi and G. ericsonii, with cell densities three times higher than those of G. oceanica, even at \n\nthe coastal stations (Table 2.2). During the high-productive period, however, the ratio between \n\nthe two species was reversed, with G. oceanica dominating over G. muellerae near the coast \n\n(see Figure 6.2a,b). In the sediment, though, G. muellerae was by far the most abundant \n\ncoccolith species  (?3\u00b5m) in surface sediments, with concentrations often higher than those of \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\n188 \n\nE. huxleyi and G. ericsonii, and dominating the assemblages of both coastal and more offshore \n\nareas (except on the Estremadura shelf) (Figure 4.4d and 6.1c). Higher percentages of coccoliths \n\nfrom G. muellerae in sediments of oceanic areas outside the canyons are in good agreement \n\nwith the relatively higher abundance of this species in more oligotrophic surface waters off \n\ncentral Portugal, in comparison to other placolith-bearing species such as G. oceanica, E. \n\nhuxleyi). \n\nThe overwhelming dominance of G. muellerae over G. oceanica in the sediment suggests \n\nthat, whereas the latter may be faster and more efficient in its response to intermittent \u201cbursts\u201d \n\nof nutrient input, G. muellerae may maintain a more regular production on the longer run. \n\nAlthough phytoplankton blooms often result in higher production of zooplankton faecal pellets \n\nand therefore a more efficient transfer of coccoliths from the upper water layers to the seafloor \n\nthan during non-bloom conditions (see Roth, 1994; Steinmetz, 1994; Balch, 2004), results \n\npresented here give rise to new questions about the real importance of bloom events in the \n\ngeneration of the sedimentary record.  \n\n \n\n \n\nCoccolithophores in the central Portuguese submarine canyons: the Nazar\u00e9 and \n\nLisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons \n\nCompared to the effort made over the last 15 years to characterize and understand the \n\ngeology and geomorphology of the central Portuguese canyons, little was known until recently \n\nabout how these canyons affect the circulation over the shelf and upper slope and the production \n\nand distribution of phytoplankton. The present thesis was specifically addressing these \n\nquestions, providing some indications about the influence of the canyons on the present day \n\necology and distribution of coccolithophores on the central Portuguese margin. \n\nThe Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head appeared to be the stage of different processes converging in \n\nthe near-shore area. On the one hand, this area seemed to constitute a local \u201cpool\u201d of oceanic \n\nwater masses near the coast during winter, contrasting to nutrient-richer water masses from the \n\nsurrounding shelf and coast. This was revealed by CTD sections along the upper canyon axis \n\nshowing that the core of the IPC reached very near-shore areas less than 10 km off the coast via \n\nthe canyon, and by the single occurrence of typical subtropical-oligotrophic species \n\nDiscosphaera tubifera, Palusphaera vandelii and Calcidiscus leptoporus associated with water \n\nof southerly origin advected by the IPC (Figures 3.10d and 3.2). This observation agrees with \n\nearlier studies indicating that narrow submarine canyons may significantly deflect shelf \n\ncirculation when stratification is absent (Klinck, 1988; Hickey, 1997), thereby intensifying \n\nwater mass exchange between the ocean and the coast. High relative abundances of coccoliths \n\nproduced by G. muellerae in sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, \n\nand in the middle Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, equivalent to abundances more typically found in the \n\noffshore areas (Figure 4.4d), could be tracing the preferential onflow of more oceanic water \n\nmasses through these canyons. \n\n \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Future Work \n\n \n\n189 \n\nAt the same time, several observations seem to support the hypothesis of enhanced \n\nphytoplankton production  in the canyon head: the presence of a diverse coccolithophore \n\nassemblage dominated by the productive E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii and C. mediterranea, together \n\nwith maxima of both neritic-coastal taxa (i.e. G. oceanica, Acanthoica spp.) and neritic-oceanic \n\ntaxa (i.e. G. muellerae, S. dalmaticus, Alisphaera spp., Michaelsarsia elegans), and the \n\nobservation of a Chl-a peak at the canyon head obtained in March 2010 (Figure 3.11c). Surface \n\nwater Chl-a distribution determined from satellite data, indicate the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon head as an \n\narea of persistent high phytoplankton production particularly between March and October) \n\n(Figure 3.11a). This agrees well with enhanced percentages of coastal-neritic coccolith species \n\n(C. mediterranea and H. carteri) in sediment of the canyon head in comparison to the adjacent \n\ncoastal areas (Fig. 4.4b,f). Enhanced Chl-a concentrations often found south of the canyon and \n\nclose to Cape Carvoeiro support previous observations by Mendes et al. (2011) of persistently \n\nhigh diatom concentrations south of the canyon, apparently related to intensification of \n\nupwelling along the southern canyon rim and extending its influence to the shelf south of the \n\ncanyon, persisting even during relaxation of upwelling-favourable winds.  \n\nThe relatively higher diversity of coccolithophores found in the canyon head may be \n\nconsidered as representative for late-winter conditions in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, involving \n\nlocally enhanced production of more opportunistic phytoplankton species by upwelling \n\nintensification and internal tidal pumping, and introduction of oceanic species along with the \n\nshoreward advection of oceanic and oligotrophic water masses through the narrow upper canyon \n\n(see Figure 6.1). The more pronounced mixing of coccoliths from both coastal-neritic and \n\noceanic species in sediments from the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, compared to the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, \n\nconfirms the enhanced exchange of water masses between coastal and oceanic regions in the \n\nNazar\u00e9 Canyon system. This seems not only to apply to the advection of living coccolithophores \n\nfrom oceanic to more coastal areas in the upper water masses ((paleo)ecological record), but \n\nalso to the down-canyon transport of coccoliths produced by coastal-neritic species in the upper \n\ncanyon reaches, by internal tides and turbidity currents acting along the bottom of the canyon \n\n(taphonomical record).  \n\nIn the vicinity of Belatina Valley, in the upper Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, indications for interaction \n\nof the canyon with surface water circulation and phytoplankton production consist in local \n\nmaxima in surface water concentrations of nutrients, Chl-a, and coccolithophore cell densities. \n\nMaximum density gradients between the superficial buoyant plume existing during the time of \n\nthe cruise and the winter mixed layer underneath, appear to reflect a significant topographic \n\neffect induced by this narrow part of the canyon on the surface circulation, generating a front \n\nbetween the buoyant plume and the shelf-slope waters (Figure 3.7). This agrees with previous \n\nobservations from Quaresma (2012) who found that this part of the canyon acts as a water drain \n\nfor the surrounding area during every low tide, potentially resulting in the concentration of \n\nparticles in the surface water layer, which over time would result in local nutrient-enrichment \n\nfavorable for phytoplankton growth. Earlier studies also referred to the important role of ocean \n\ncurrents within and above submarine canyons in funneling and trapping plankton (Macquart-\n\nMoulin and Patriti, 1996; Bosley et al., 2004; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\n190 \n\nBelow the surface, the vertical density gradient existing between the surficial buoyant \n\nplume and the ENACW may have promoted the baroclinic oscillation of the water masses \n\nwithin the narrow canyon topography. The presence of a meander in this part of the canyon axis,  \n\nblocking the flow of the internal wave, seemed to enhance the vertical oscillation (Figure 3.2). \n\nPrevious observations also suggested that Belatina Valley may be a site of enhanced \n\nphytoplankton productivity, through the action of internal tidal pumping of nutrients from below \n\nthe canyon rim up to the photic layer, particularly under stratified conditions prevailing during \n\nsummer (e.g. Oliveira et al., 2007) Similar processes have also been reported to occur in the \n\nMonterey Canyon, California (Ryan et al., 2005; 2010).  \n\nWhen comparing the Nazar\u00e9 and the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons, differences in the coccolith \n\nassemblages between the upper reaches of the two canyons seem to reflect differences in their \n\nenvironmental settings and dynamics; a more coastal ecological signature (i.e. dominance of C. \n\nmediterranea, H. carteri, and to some extent also G. oceanica) in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon probably \n\nreflects the greater proximity of this canyon head to the coastline and the associated \n\nintensification of upwelling and stronger influence of coastal dynamics (see Figure 6.1). On the \n\ncontrary, a more oceanic ecological signature in the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon (i.e. dominance of \n\nG. muellerae, C. leptoporus and UUR) suggests that a generally more oceanic-pelagic \n\nenvironment characterised by more oligotrophic nutrient conditions is prevailing in this canyon, \n\nwhich may be explained by its greater distance from coastal dynamics. In addition, a stronger \n\ninfluence of ENACWst in the southern part of the study area will expectedly leave a clearer \n\n\u201coceanic ecological imprint\u201d (i.e. C. leptoporus and UUR) in this canyon.  \n\nApart from distinct ecological conditions prevailing in the surface waters overlying the \n\nNazar\u00e9 and Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyons, differences in their bottom sedimentary dynamics should \n\nalso be considered when interpreting differences in the coccolith assemblages; i.e. stronger \n\neffects of intermittent down-canyon gravity flows and bottom resuspension by internal tidal \n\ncurrents in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon, in comparison to calmer sedimentary conditions prevailing in \n\nthe Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon (see Figure 6.1).  \n\n \n\n \n\nTaphonomy vs. (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores in coastal settings  \n\nAlthough coccolith thanatocoenoses preserved in seabed sediments may be expected to \n\nshow a general correspondence with the living communities dwelling in the overlying photic \n\nlayer, the correspondence is generally complicated (see Steinmetz, 1994; Roth, 1994) due to \n\nmodification of the primary ecological signal by a variety of taphonomical processes integrated \n\nover several months, years, decades, centuries or even thousands of years (Figure 5.1). \n\nComplexity further increases in shallower marine environments such as continental \n\nshelves, particularly in areas where submarine canyons are deeply incising the shelf and coast, \n\nand where continental and oceanic processes interplay. Sediments in such dynamic areas will \n\nalways contain an averaged paleoenvironmental signal composed of the cumulative of  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.1\u2013 Schematic representation of the most striking environmental differences between coastal submarine canyons and adjacent coast-shelf areas, using the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon as example: (a) outside the canyons the coast-ocean gradient represented by r-selected taxa near the coast, and K-selected taxa further offshore, is more distinctive in \n\ncomparison to the canyon (b) where a mixture of K- and r-selected taxa is noticed in the upper canyon; focusing of oceanic water masses via the canyon results in advection of \n\nsubtropical taxa towards the coast and, concurrently, enhanced nutrient pumping driven by intensified upwelling and focusing of internal tidal activity in the canyon head \n\nresults in enhanced production of r-selected taxa in this area. The mixing of ecologically diverse taxa is also recorded on the seabed of the canyon and extends from the upper \n\nto the middle canyon axis, with additional contribution of coccoliths resuspended and transported down-canyon by internal tides. Green colors represent the injection of \n\nnutrients by coastal upwelling and internal tidal pumping and r-selected coccolithophores (e.g. C. mediterranea \u2013 Cm; E. huxleyi \u2013 Eh; G. oceanica \u2013 Go). Thicker green \n\narrow in the canyon illustrates the intensification of these phenomena in the upper canyon reaches. Blue colors represent onshore advection of oceanic water masses via the \n\ncanyon and entrained oceanic-oligotrophic taxa (e.g. Syracosphaera spp. \u2013 Syraco; Calcidiscus leptoporus \u2013 Cl; Discosphaera tubifera \u2013 Dtub). Coccoliths represented in the \n\nfigure belong to taphonomically-resistant taxa C. leptoporus, G. oceanica, C. mediterranea. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\necological and sedimentary signals, of which only the stronger leave a recognisable \u201cimprint\u201d in the \n\nsediment. \n\nIn the studied data set from the central Portuguese margin, diversity of coccolithophores in the \n\nsurface water layer appeared much higher (35 species) than that of coccoliths preserved in the sediment \n\n(18 species), illustrating the significant loss of information occurring between the moment of \n\ncoccolithophore production in the photic layer and the incorporation of the coccoliths within the seafloor \n\nsediment. Post-mortem loss of information (i.e. due to biostratonomy) was particularly important for \n\nsmaller and more delicate taxa such as Syracosphaera spp., Ophiaster spp., S. dalmaticus which, despite \n\ntheir significant concentrations in the photic layer, were found to be rare or absent in the sediment.  \n\nLarge placolith- (Gephyrocapsa spp., C. pelagicus, C. leptoporus), helicolith- (H. carteri), and \n\nsome robust caneolith-bearing taxa (C. mediterranea and Syracosphaera pulchra) appeared less affected \n\nby early diagenesis and most likely to become part of the sediment assemblage, which agrees with earlier \n\nstudies reporting these species as being the most dissolution-resistant (e.g. Steinmetz, 1994; Roth, 1994; \n\nAndruleit et al., 2003; Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Baumann et al., 2005). In contrast, smaller placolith-\n\nbearing taxa like E. huxleyi and G. ericsonii have been recognized as more easily affected by dissolution, \n\nreason for which their coccolith concentrations are here used as qualitative indicators for the degree of \n\npreservation of the coccolith assemblages in the sediment. \n\nIndeed, in the studied assemblages from the central Portuguese margin, the most striking difference \n\nconcerns the drastic relative decrease of E. huxleyi and the important relative increase of G. muellerae. \n\nWhereas E. huxleyi showed an overwhelming dominance in the living communities from both low- and \n\nhigh-productive periods, other species significantly increased in the sediment, even those which showed \n\nonly low concentrations in the upper photic layer. Such is the case for larger species like H. carteri, C. \n\nleptoporus and C. pelagicus (Figure 6.2). \n\nDespite of its observed ability to rapidly respond to nutrient input, and relative robustness of its \n\ncoccoliths, G. oceanica appeared to be less abundant in the sediment in comparison to G. muellerae, \n\nwhilst in the living assemblages observed during the cruise G. oceanica was generally the more abundant \n\nof the two species. This suggests that G. muellerae may be more productive in the long run and over a \n\nbroader area off Portugal, whereas G. oceanica is mostly abundant in particularly productive areas such \n\nas the upper Nazar\u00e9 canyon region and adjacent southern continental shelf. This finding raises new \n\nquestions on whether coccolith assemblages preserved in the sediment are mostly formed by steady \n\nproduction of less conspicuous \u201cslow\u201d coccolithophores, or by bursts of bloom species such as G. \n\noceanica and E. huxleyi. At the same time, given the apparently broader ecological tolerance of G. \n\nmuellerae, this study suggest that this species may have lower potential as paleoenvironmental proxy in \n\ncomparison to G. oceanica, which appears to be particularly well adapted to high-productive coastal \n\nenvironments.  \n\nIn addition to the effects of biostratonomy and early diagenesis, winnowing by waves and currents \n\nin more near-shore areas are additional factors adding complexity to the transformation of coccolith \n\nassemblages from coastal settings. Due to their tiny size, coccoliths are less prone to accumulate in \n\ncoarse-grained deposits of the shelf and upper slope, but more likely accumulate in fine-grained \n\nhemipelagic deposits of the middle and lower slope and the canyons. \n\n \n\n192 \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Future Work \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 \u2013 Relative proportions of dominant coccolithophores observed in shelf and slope waters off central Portugal in March \n\n2010 (a, Nazar\u00e9 Canyon axis, low-productive period; b, off Cape Carvoeiro, high-productive period) and of coccoliths in \n\nsediments from the central Portuguese shelf and slope (c). Species relative abundances presented in (a) and (b) are based on \n\nintegration of species cell densities over the 0-110 m water depth interval, such that Inventory SpA = SpA cells/m\n3\n (0-15m)*15 + \n\nSpA cells/m\n3 \n(15-37.5m)*22.5 + SpA cells/m\n\n3 \n(37.5-75m)*37.5 + SpA cells/m\n\n3 \n(75-110m)*35. In stations where coccolithophore \n\nconcentrations were lacking for certain depth intervals, concentrations were extrapolated from adjacent stations. Greater coast-to-\n\nocean variability in (c) is due to the indiscriminate inclusion of samples from widely different settings in the graph. \n\n \n\n193 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\nThis process appears to affect all taxa, as shown by a general decrease of coccolith concentrations \n\ntowards the coast particularly evident along transects across the open shelf and slope, and a general \n\nincrease of coccolith concentrations and fluxes in the upper canyon reaches in comparison to the adjacent \n\nshelf areas (Figures 4.3 and 5.3). The concentration of coccoliths along with other fine-grained material in \n\nupper canyon sediment depocenters, includes both coccoliths produced in the overlying photic layer \n\n(ecological signal \u2013 vertical flux), as well as resuspended coccoliths arriving by lateral transport \n\n(biostratonomical signal \u2013 lateral flux). \n\nDespite of all these complicating factors, two distinct coccolith assemblages could be \n\ndistinguished, which seem to reflect the ecological trends from the overlying photic layer off central \n\nPortugal: a coccolith assemblage of coastal affinity primarily represented by C. mediterranea, H. carteri \n\nand G. oceanica, and another assemblage of oceanic affinity, composed of C. leptoporus, G.muellerae \n\nand UUR (Figures 4.4. and 5.3). No consistent evidence for selective transport or preservation of \n\nindividual taxa was found when considering the taphonomically more resistant taxa: C. leptoporus and H. \n\ncarteri, two species of comparable size and expectedly comparable degree of resistance to dissolution and \n\nphysical breakage, exhibited distinct and opposite distribution patterns, unrelated to trends in sediment \n\nparticle size. C. leptoporus was more abundant offshore in fine-grained sediments, whereas H. carteri \n\nwas more abundant close to the shore in coarser grained sediment. Similarly, G. oceanica and C. \n\nmediterranea, two smaller and more fragile coccolith species were preferably found closer to the coast \n\ndespite the stronger winnowing and destructive mechanical forces in that area. \n\nIn the submarine canyons, similar trends were also recorded although somewhat levelled-out, \n\nprobably reflecting interference of the ecological-oceanographic signal resulting from enhanced \n\necological and oceanographic processes in the surface water and the taphonomical signal resulting from \n\nthe intense bottom water dynamics in the canyons. Especially in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon onshore advection of \n\noceanic coccolithophore species through the canyon and down-canyon transport of coastal-neritic \n\ncoccoliths appears to result in mixing of oceanic and coastal-neritic assemblages. Even so, locally \n\nenhanced productivity in the canyon head appears to be persistent enough to be reflected in the \n\n(paleo)ecological record preserved in the sediment (see Figure 6.1).  \n\nIn the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon the (paleo)ecological record may be expected to be less disturbed \n\nand determined mostly by the vertical flux of coccoliths produced in the overlying water, due to the fact \n\nthat this canyon seems to represents a less dynamic sedimentary environment in comparison to the Nazar\u00e9 \n\nCanyon (De Stigter et al., 2011). Nevertheless, whereas the relative increase of coccoliths of G. muellerae \n\nobserved in the upper reaches of this canyon may reflect shoreward advection of oceanic water masses \n\nthrough the canyon, concentration of this species by taphonomical processes should not be excluded; \n\nsince abundances of G. muellerae on the adjacent Sines and Estremadura shelves are distinctly lower than \n\nin the Lisbon-Set\u00fabal canyon, and this species was by far the most abundant (? 3\u00b5m) in open slope \n\nsediments, the high relative abundance in upper canyon sediments may partially reflect up-canyon \n\ndisplacement of coccoliths from the deeper canyon and slope, along with the overall up-canyon \n\nsuspended sediment transport that seems to occur in this canyon (De Stigter et al., 2011).  \n\nIn conclusion, results of this study seem to indicate that despite of all the factors intervening with \n\nthe deposition and preservation of coccoliths in sediments of coastal-neritic areas, leading to significant \n\nloss of the initial species diversity of the live coccolithophore assemblage, the taphonomically resistant \n\n194 \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Future Work \n\n \n\n \n\ncoccolith taxa may be useful tracers of ecological and oceanographical processes occurring on the central \n\nPortuguese margin. It appears generally more difficult to make ecological inferences based on coccoliths \n\npreserved in the sedimentary record of canyons, due to the more complex surface circulation and stronger \n\nbottom water dynamics prevailing in these areas. Knowledge of the oceanographic processes occurring in \n\nthese areas appears crucial prerequisite for the correct interpretation of the ecological signals preserved in \n\nsediments from submarine canyons. \n\n \n\n \n\nCompositional Data Analysis: the isometric log-ratio approach  \n\nDetermining species relative abundance in percentage relative to the sum of total or selected \n\ncommon coccoliths is a standard analytical procedure in paleoecological studies, by which ecological \n\ninter-relationships between species can be inferred independently of sediment dilution effects. However, \n\ndetermining percentages entails inconsistencies mostly related to the closure problem, often leading to \n\nspurious correlations between the taxa and biased statistical analysis, and thus to potentially unrealistic \n\ninterpretations (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2006). The Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) \n\napproach applied in this study has the advantage that scale-invariance and subcompositional coherence \n\nare satisfied, which is essential to avoid spurious correlations. By implementing the use of isometric log-\n\nratios, CoDA allows extracting all the information contained in data variability, thus leading to more \n\nreliable comparisons and interpretations (Buccianti, 2013). \n\nIn the present study, CoDA allowed to validate the existence of two main coccolithophore \n\nassemblages, initially inferred from percentage data: one of coastal-neritic affinity, and another of oceanic \n\naffinity. The most striking (paleo)ecological differences among the five studied transects, i.e. canyons vs. \n\nadjacent margins, and Nazar\u00e9 Canyon vs. Lisbon-Set\u00fabal Canyon, were also revealed by both \n\ncompositional and classical approaches. CoDa balances revealed higher stability further offshore, \n\npossibly reflecting more uniform depositional conditions away from shelf and upper canyon dynamics, \n\nwhere the (paleo)ecological record is less disturbed and mostly derived from vertical coccolith fluxes \n\n(Figure 5.5). In contrast, the increasing variability of the balances towards the coast reflects the increasing \n\neffect of taphonomical processes associated to coastal dynamics, mostly related to coccolith resuspension \n\nand transport by waves and currents (see Chapter 4 \u2013 Table 4.2). \n\nThe higher weight of the oceanic assemblage in the studied dataset reflects the significant \n\ndominance and broad distribution of G. muellerae in the study area (Figure 5.4; see section I). CoDA also \n\nconfirmed the mixing of coastal and oceanic taxa along the canyons, contrasting with the clear separation \n\nbetween coastal and oceanic taxa on the adjacent shelf and slope areas (Figure 5.6), reflecting the \n\ndifferent oceanographic and sedimentary dynamics of the canyons and the open shelf and slope. \n\nThe good agreement between trends observed in percentage data and trends revealed by CoDA \n\nconfirms the robustness of the coccolith (paleo)ecological signal preserved in sediments of the central \n\nPortuguese margin. Nevertheless, calibration with isometric log-ratio is recommended as a basic \n\nrequirement in (paleo)ecological studies, since it cannot be assured in advance that use of percentage data \n\nwill produce reliable results (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2006). Combining the two approaches \n\nmight be the best option in order to take full advantage of the data set: the species percentages serve as a \n\n195 \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\n\u201cpreview\u201d of the data and the species relative abundances, and providing leads for the SBP, whereas \n\nusing CoDA allows validating and confirming the results in a consistent framework.  \n\n \n\n6.2. Future Work \n\nResults presented in this thesis show that coccolithophores are valuable tracers for oceanograpic, \n\necological and sedimentary processes occurring on the central Portuguese margin. It was demonstrated \n\nthat short-term hydrographic-meteorological variability should be taken into account when interpreting \n\ncoccolith assemblages preserved in the sedimentary record of continental margin settings. In addition, \n\nnew insights are provided with regards to the impact of sea bottom topography and oceanographic \n\ncirculation on both ecology and taphonomy of coccolithophores, and notably the role of submarine \n\ncanyons as preferential conduits for advection of oceanic water masses into more coastal areas and the \n\ndown-canyon transport of suspended particles near the bottom.  \n\nIn the case of Belatina Valley, however, where enhanced local productivity of coccolithophores \n\ninferred from in situ measurements could not be corroborated by satellite data nor by coccoliths in the \n\nsedimentary record, validation by means of additional sampling surveys may be required, addressing the \n\nseasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton (in general) and coccolithophores (in particular), \n\nintegrated with meteorological and hydrological monitoring. Enhanced productivity at Belativa Valley \n\nmay be too deep and short-lived to be detected in monthly averages of surface water Chl-a obtained by \n\nsatellite. Long-term in situ observations within and outside the canyon axis should therefore be performed \n\nin future studies, in order to evaluate the spatial and temporal persistency of ecological hotspots occurring \n\nin this area; i.e. how long they exist, at the surface or deeper in the water column, and if they are actually \n\nconfined to the canyon axis and its immediate vicinity, or part of a larger pattern not necessarily related to \n\nthe canyon.  \n\nA more complete and time-integrated understanding of the influence of the central Portuguese \n\ncanyons on the seasonal production and spatial distribution of coccolithophores could be obtained by \n\nmeans of sediment trap moorings deployed at specific locations along the canyon (i.e. canyon head, \n\nupper-middle and middle-lower canyon transition), and at different depths along the water column (i.e. \n\njust below the photic zone but above the canyon rim, at intermediate depth, and near the bottom). \n\nAlthough earlier studies referred to the overprinting of the productivity signal in sediment traps by \n\nresuspended or advected particles in shallower regions (i.e. Broerse, 2000; Sprengel et al., 2002), results \n\nof the present study give confidence that ecological phenomena off central Portugal are strong and \n\npersistent enough to leave their imprint in the sediment. In fact, sediment traps would allow addressing \n\nseveral questions concerning the transport and sedimentation of coccoliths in the canyons. By evaluating \n\nactual fluxes of coccoliths towards the canyon seafloor, it can be assessed to what extent this flux \n\nrepresents export production (i.e. reflecting changes in productivity in the overlying surface waters) or \n\nhas a significant component determined by lateral advection and bottom resuspension of coccoliths. \n\nFinally, for testing the application of coccoliths as proxies of paleoceanographic and \n\npaleoenvironmental changes in the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon region, two long sediment cores previously collected \n\nfrom the north and south bank of the lower Nazar\u00e9 Canyon (Koho, 2008) might offer interesting \n\n196 \n\n\n\nSynthesis and Future Work \n\n \n\n \n\nopportunities. Analysis of coccolith assemblages from these cores may give insight in millennial scale \n\nvariations in NAO during the Holocene, its frequency and impact on the sedimentary and ecological \n\ndynamics off central Portugal. Periods characterized by a negative NAO index will expectedly be marked \n\nby increased terrigenous sediment supply to the lower canyon due to intensified canyon flushing events \n\ntriggered by enhanced storm and river flooding frequency; in coccolith assemblages marked by greater \n\ndiversity of oceanic species and higher percentages of reworked coastal-neritic species. Periods \n\ncharacterized by a positive NAO index will most likely be marked by hemipelagic sedimentation, with \n\nrelatively higher proportions of oceanic coccoliths. In addition, comparing coccolith assemblages from \n\nthe two contrasting sedimentary environments, the north bank being affected by spill-over of sediment \n\ngravity flows going down the canyon, and the south bank apparently only affected by continuous \n\nhemipelagic deposition, may contribute to better distinction of transport in fossil coccolith assemblages.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n197 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\nReferences  \n\nAbrantes, F., Moita, T., 1999.

Its ecological importance lies in the replenishment of surface waters with nutrients stimulating \n\nprimary production. \n\nCoastal downwelling \u2013 Downward and offshore movement of water from superficial levels of the water \n\ncolumn, induced by the onshore movement of the Ekman surface layer in response to longshore wind \n\nstress.  \n\nCoriolis force \u2013 force apparently experienced by any object moving through a rotating reference frame, \n\ncausing deflection relative to the reference frame. Winds and currents moving across the rotating Earth\u2019s \n\nsurface experience Coriolis force acting at right angles to the direction of motion, causing deflection to the \n\nright in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left on the southern Hemisphere. The Coriolis force has \n\nmaximum magnitude at the poles and zero at the Equator. \n\nContinental margin \u2013 submersed region of a continent, linking the continental landmass with the oceanic \n\nbasins. It is constituted by a low-gradient and narrow continental shelf passing into a steep continental \n\nslope and rise below the shelf-break which is often located at ~150-200 m depth. Intensified exchange of \n\nwater masses and organic/inorganic matter occurs between the continent and the deep-sea where submarine \n\ncanyons are deeply carving the continental margin edges. \n\nDense water cascading \u2013 near-bottom gravity current resulting from density difference between water \n\nmasses on the shelf and adjacent slope, or from denser shelf water being forced over the shelf-break by \n\nexternal forcing (e.g. downwelling favourable-wind), and contributing to the ventilation of intermediate \n\nand deep oceanic waters.  \n\nDiagenesis \u2013 Physical and chemical processes that lead to the alteration of the organism remains and \n\nassociated mineral sedimentary component that occurs within the sedimentary matrix since after its burial. \n\nEastern Boundary Current \u2013 broad and shallow diffuse currents along the eastern side of oceanic basins, \n\nadjacent to the western coasts of continents (e.g. Portugal, Canary and Benguela currents on the eastern \n\nside of the Atlantic Ocean; California Current on the eastern side of Pacific Ocean). Coastal upwelling is a \n\nrecurrent feature of these current systems and hence, they are highly productive.  \n\nEkman circulation \u2013 movement of water resulting from the action of wind forcing on the ocean surface, \n\nbalanced by the Coriolis force. On the Northern Hemisphere, it results in an averaged net transport of water \n\n90\u00ba to the right of the prevailing wind direction, causing divergence (upwelling) or convergence \n\n(downwelling) of water, depending on the prevailing wind forcing direction.  \n\nGeostrophic currents \u2013 currents resulting from the balance between the Coriolis force and horizontal \n\npressure gradients, i.e. water tends to flow from high to low pressure, as moving water tends towards a state \n\nof equilibrium, resulting in the tendency of slope and shelf currents to follow isobaths. \n\n\n\nAppendix  \n\n \n\n246 \n\n \n\nSediment gravity flow \u2013 general term for sediment transport driven by gravity, including turbidity currents \n\nand debris flows. It results from a mixture of water and sediment particles, where the gravity acting on the \n\nsediment particles moves the fluid and not the contrary (as in land rivers), being the predominant and most \n\nefficient process by which particles are transported down a continental slope, and the prevailing transport \n\nmechanism within many submarine canyons.  \n\nInternal wave \u2013 gravity wave that oscillate within any stratified fluid medium (e.g. the atmosphere and the \n\nocean), being commonly generated over continental margins, where stratified water flows over irregular \n\ntopography. They can propagate over large distances, causing turbulence and mixing, often strong enough \n\nto resuspend bottom sediments from the shelf and slope regions and thus, contributing to the generation of \n\nbottom nepheloid layers.  \n\nInternal tide \u2013 internal waves that propagate at a tidal frequency, i.e. at diurnal and semidiurnal periods. \n\nNecrocoenosis (necros = death; cenosis = community) \u2013 accumulation of dead organisms (dead bodies \n\nwith organic matter). \n\nOrictocoenosis (orictos = fossil; cenosis = community) \u2013 Association of fossil elements preserved in the \n\nsediment that have been subjected to diagenesis during a significant period of (geological) time.  \n\n(Paleo)biocoenosis or (paleo)ecological assemblage (paleo = old; bios = life) - community of organisms \n\nthat lived in a certain biotope during a certain recent time period (i.e. not fossilized). \n\nr-selected species \u2013 species able to reproduce quickly in unstable or unpredictable, often characterized for \n\npresenting small body size and high maximum growth rates (e.g. diatoms, which are known as being \n\nopportunistic species well adapted to survive and flourish within nutrient-rich and turbulent coastal \n\nenvironments). As opposed to K-selected species which are better adapted to compete successfully for \n\nlimited nutrient availability in more stable or predictable environments, presenting larger body size and \n\nlower maximum growth rates, resulting in very constant populations that are in equilibrium with the \n\nenvironmental resources (e.g. coccolithophores thriving in the subtropical oceanic gyres).  \n\nTaphocoenosis (tafos = grave; cenosis = community) \u2013 Buried association of skeletal remains within a \n\ncertain sedimentation area. \n\nTaphonomy \u2013 refers to the set of processes that rule the transition of organic remains from the biosphere \n\ntowards the lithosphere, from the moment of the organism death until it is recovered as a fossil. \n\nThanatocoenosis (tanatos = death; cenosis = community) \u2013 Post-mortem association of skeletal remains \n\n(without organic matter) deposited on the water/sediment or subaereal/soil interfaces. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAppendix  \n\n \n\n247 \n\n \n\nAC \u2013 Azores Current \n\nAcan \u2013 Acanthoica spp. \n\nAlisph \u2013 Alisphaera spp. \n\nB \u2013 Biostratonomy: B1, dispersion and sinking of \n\nisolated coccoliths through the water column; B2, \n\nrapid transport of coccospheres in faecal pellets \n\ntowards the bottom. \n\nBiom \u2013 Biomass (Chl-a) \n\nBNL \u2013 Bottom Nepheloid Layer \n\nBP \u2013 Bouyant Plume \n\nCC \u2013 Canary Current \n\nChl-a \u2013 Chlorophyll-a \n\nCl \u2013 Calcidiscus leptoporus \n\nCm - Coronosphaera mediterranea \n\nCoDA \u2013 Compositional Data Analysis \n\nCorg/Ntot \u2013 Ratio between organic carbon and \n\ntotal nitrogen \n\nCp \u2013 Coccolithus pelagicus \n\nCTD \u2013 Conductivity, Temperature, Density \n\nD - Diagenesis \n\nDtub \u2013 Discosphaera tubifera \n\nEh \u2013 Emiliania huxleyi \n\nENACW \u2013 Eastern North Atlantic Central \n\nWater: st, subtropical origin; sp, subpolar origin; \n\nF1-F4 \u2013 Factors 1-4 from Factor Analysis \n\nFR \u2013 Fossil Record \n\nFTU \u2013 Formazin Turbidity Unit \n\nGe \u2013 Gephyrocapsa ericsonii \n\nGm \u2013 Gephyrocapsa muellerae \n\nGo \u2013 Gephyrocapsa oceanica \n\nHc \u2013 Helicosphaera carteri \n\nHPLC - High-Performance Liquid \n\nChromatograph \n\nIlr \u2013 Isometric Log-Ratio \n\nIPC \u2013 Iberian Poleward Current \n\nLDW \u2013 Lower Deep Water \n\nM \u2013 Mixing  \n\nMOW \u2013 Mediterranean Outflow Water \n\nNC \u2013 Nazar\u00e9 Canyon \n\nN:P \u2013 Ratio Nitrates/ Phosphates \n\nN \u2013 Necrolysis: N1, isolated cell lysis; N2, \n\nzooplankton grazing \n\nNAC \u2013 North Atlantic Current \n\nNAO \u2013 North Atlantic Oscillation \n\nNEADW \u2013 North East Atlantic Deep Water \n\nOM \u2013 Organic Matter \n\nOphi \u2013 Ophiaster spp. \n\nP \u2013 Productivity: P1, continuous production of \n\ncoccolithophores; P2, coccolithophore blooms \n\nPAR \u2013 Photossynthetic Available Radiance \n\nPC \u2013 Portugal Current \n\nPMC \u2013 Particulate Matter Concentration \n\nPE \u2013 (Paleo)ecological Record: PEw (= weak), \n\necological component that derives from \n\ncontinuous production of coccolithophores; PEs \n\n(= strong), ecological component able to \n\nintroduce changes in species inter-relationships in \n\nthe sedimentary record; PE\u2019, allochtonous \n\ncoccolithophore productivity (advection from \n\nadjacent water masses) and reworked fossil or \n\nsubfossil specimens (bottom resuspension). \n\nPLM \u2013 Polarizing Light Microscopy \n\nSAR \u2013 Sediment Accumulation Rate \n\nSBP \u2013 Sequential Binary Partition \n\nSdalm \u2013 Syracolithus dalmaticus \n\nSEM \u2013 Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\nSyraco \u2013 Syracosphaera spp. \n\nTS \u2013Temperature and Salinity \n\nTurb - Turbidity \n\nUUR \u2013 Umbilicosphaera sibogae, \n\nUmbellosphaera irregularis, Rhabdosphaera \n\nspp. \n\nWIBP \u2013 Winter Iberian Bouyant Plume \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix D \n\nDigital Data \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n251 \n\n \n\nAPPENDIX D \u2013 Digital Data \n\n1 \u2013 PhD Thesis of Catarina A.
