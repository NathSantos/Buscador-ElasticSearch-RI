Samples\nand measurements were taken every other day at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 m depths. The relationship\nbetween variability of the populations and some environmental factors was analyzed. The main species\nwere: Argyrodiaptomus furcatus (Sars), Notodiaptomus iheringi (Wright), Mesocyclops longisetus\n(Thi\u00e9baud), Thermocyclops decipiens (Fischer), and T. minutus (Lowndes). Thermocyclops minutus\nwas the most abundant species in dry season and its abundance varied significantly between sam-\npling days. A large increase in abundance of calanoids occurred during the rainy season. This increase\nwas correlated with higher temperature values. At that time, Notodiaptomus iheringi was dominant.\nThis species showed significant short-term variations in abundance in both dry and rainy seasons.\nSignificant variation in density of populations within the same sampling period might result from\neither the dispersion pattern of the populations or continuous substitution of the water masses. Sig-\nnificant correlation was observed between copepod abundance and temperature, especially for species\nof calanoids and there was also some correlations between densities of particular species of cope-\npods and some phytoplankton taxa, mainly during the dry season. As for vertical distribution, most\norganisms were found between the surface and 15 m deep. During the rainy season, there was some\nevidence of the occurrence of spatial segregation between species of cyclopoids and calanoids, with\nthe cyclopoids in a deeper position within the water column.\n\nKey words: short-term variability, copepod, Calanoida, Cyclopoida, tropical reservoir.\n\nRESUMO\n\nVariabilidade em curto prazo na abund\u00e2ncia de cop\u00e9podos na Represa de Jurumirim,\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil\n\nO presente estudo examinou a variabilidade na composi\u00e7\u00e3o e na abund\u00e2ncia das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de\ncop\u00e9podos, em dois per\u00edodos do ano, seco (inverno) e chuvoso (ver\u00e3o), na regi\u00e3o da barragem da\nRepresa de Jurumirim, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil.

Variations in the environment can promote\ncyclic or erratic changes in the activities of the\norganisms, short-and long-term fluctuations in the\nabundance of populations or even substitution of\nthe species. Information on how the structure of\na community changes, at different temporal scales,\ncan contribute to a better understanding of the\nfunctioning and evolution of the ecosystem.\n\nSeveral researchers in Brazil have inves-\ntigated patterns of temporal variations of the\nzooplankton, including populations of Copepoda.\nMost of the studies have considered diurnal rhy-\nthms and seasonal fluctuations (Tomm et al.,\n1982; Fisher et al., 1983; Infante, 1982; Matsu-\nmura-Tundisi &amp; Okano, 1983; Matsumura-Tundisi\net al., 1989; Lansac-T\u00f4ha et al., 1995; Nogueira\n&amp; Matsumura-Tundisi, 1996; Nogueira &amp; Pana-\nrelli, 1997). However, information about short-\nterm fluctuations in density are scarce, despite\nthe fact they can have an important role in\nplankton dynamics in tropical zones. According\nto Nilssen (1984), higher velocities of biological\nprocesses in the tropics are the main difference\nbetween temperate and low latitude lakes. Moreover,\nreservoirs built for hydroelectric production tend\nto show lower hydrodynamics stability, due to the\nshorter water retention time, than natural lakes. Thus,\nstudies on short-term variability are of major impor-\ntance for understanding the dynamics plankton\ncommunities in this kind of ecosystem, which can\nbe subject not only to the natural variations but\n\nalso to variations imposed by the operational\nsystem for electricity production.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate patterns\nin short-term variability of zooplancton abundance\nin the lacustrine zone of a tropical reservoir (Juru-\nmirim Reservoir), located in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo,\nBrazil. Sampling was carried out in the dry (winter)\nand rainy (summer) seasons in order to discriminate\nthe influence of seasonal effects. In this paper we\npresent data on Copepoda populations while data\non Cladocera and Rotifera are being analyzed to\nbe published opportunely.\n\nSTUDY AREA\n\nJurumirim Reservoir (Fig. 1) is a large reser-\nvoir built in 1962 for generating hydroelectricity.\nIt is located in the upper region of the Parana-\npanema River (Upper Paran\u00e1 basin), State of S\u00e3o\nPaulo, Brazil. The main water body is positioned\nbetween latitudes 23o08\u2019 and 23o35\u2019S and longi-\ntudes 48o30\u2019 and 49o13\u2019W. The reservoir receives\ntwo large tributaries on its southern side, the\nParanapanema and Taquari rivers, and several small\nrivers and streams enter the northern shore.\n\nThe zone of the reservoir near the dam is oligo-\ntrophic with characteristics of a warm monomictic\nsystem. Thermal stratification is observed during\nthe rainy season and a mixing period occurs during\nthe dry season. Further information on primary\nproduction, as well as physical and chemical cha-\nracteristics of this reservoir, including its different\nspatial compartiments can be found in Henry (1990,\n1992, 1993a, 1993b); Henry &amp; Gouveia (1993);\nHenry &amp; Maricatto (1996); Henry &amp; Nogueira\n(1999); Nogueira et al.

Local depth was 30 m. Physical\nand chemical measurements and zooplankton sam-\nples were taken every 5 meters from the surface\nto 25 m. Field work was carried out every other\nday (in the morning) from 1 to 29 July 1993 (dry\nseason winter) and from 11 January to 8 February\n1994 (rainy season summer).\n\nWater transparency was measured with a Sec-\nchi disk; water temperature with a Toho Dentan\nthermistor (ET-3); dissolved oxygen by the Winkler\nmethod (Golterman et al., 1978); pH with a Mi-\ncronal B380 pHmeter; conductivity with a Hatch\n\nconductivimeter (model 2511); suspended solids\nby gravimetry, as described in Cole (1979), and\nthe phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a con-\ncentration) was estimated according to Golterman\net al. (1978), using cold acetone as solvent. Cli-\nmatological data (air temperature, wind speed and\nprecipitation) acquired from a meteorological\nstation located near the dam were supplied by the\nelectric company, Cesp (Companhia Energ\u00e9tica\nde S\u00e3o Paulo).\n\nFor quantitative analysis of the zooplankton,\n300 liters of water were collected at each sampling\nlayer using a gasoline pumping system connected\nto a hose 38 mm in diameter. This volume was filtered\nusing a plankton net of 55 \u00b5m mesh size. A net with\nthe same mesh size was used in vertical hauls for\ntaking samples for qualitative analysis. All samples\nwere preserved in 4% formalin.

G. and HENRY, R.\n\nCalanoida (nauplii, copepodids and adults)\nand Cyclopoida (adults and copepodids) were\ncounted on a stereo microscope (ZEISS, Stemi\nSV6), using sub-samples with at least 150 indi-\nviduals or the entire sample, when the density of\norganisms was low. Sub-samples (with at least 150\norganisms) were used to count nauplii of Cyclo-\npoida in Sedgwick-Rafter chambers, using an opti-\ncal microscope (ZEISS, Standard 25). Schematic\ndrawings (camara lucida) and pictures (scanning\nmicroscopy) of the species are showed in Figs. 4,\n5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed to verify\nshort-term variability of copepod abundance (ANO-\nVA), and also to detect correlation between abiotic\nfactors and population densities of copepods and\nphytoplankton (Pearson correlation). The values\nof abundance for phytoplankton taxa were obtained\nfrom Ferreira (1998), who analyzed the total phy-\ntoplankton collected at the same sampling station,\nin the same depths and on the same days when the\nzooplankton were sampled. For both analyses SAS\nsoftware was used.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEnvironmental factors\nFor some variables, e.g., precipitation, water\n\ntemperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-\n\na the differences between the periods studied were\nevident.\n\nThe data on precipitation and wind speed are\nrepresented in Fig. 2. During the sampling period\ncorresponding to the dry season the rainfall was\nlow, 1.13% of total precipitation for 1993. During\nthe sampling period corresponding to the rainy\nseason, precipitation was relatively high but not\nfrequent and constituted 23.76% of the total for\n1994. Wind speed showed high daily oscillations\nfor both periods of the year. During the rainy season\nthe daily mean was 139 km per day\u20131 (1.61 m. s\u20131).\nIn the dry season there were longer periods of low\nwind speed and the daily mean was 116 km per\nday\u20131 (1.35 m.s\u20131).\n\nSome vertical profiles of water temperature\nand dissolved oxygen are shown in Fig. 3. In the\ndry season the water column remained isothermal\nand the profiles varied between 19oC and 21oC for\nmost of the period; there were also some near-\nsurface microstratifications. During the rainy season\na thermocline was generally observed below 20 m\nand occasionally some secondary stratification\noccurred in the superficial layers. Temperature\nranged between 24oC and 27oC in the epilimnion\nand between 21oC and 23oC in deeper layers. High\noxygen concentrations were observed, with a rela-\ntively homogeneous vertical distribution during\nthe dry season.\n\nArea 446 km\n2\n\nVolume 7.9 \u00d7 109 m3\n\nRetention time (1991-1992) 334 days\n\nMaximum length 30.75 km\n\nMaximum width 10.50 km\n\nMean depth 12.9 m\n\nMaximum depth 40.0 m\n\nShoreline development index 14.9\n\nPerimeter 1,115 km\n\nAverage outflow: 29/June-29/July/1993 (dry season) 223.81 m\n3\n.s\n\n\u20131\n\nAverage outflow: 9/January-8/ February/1994 (rainy season) 186.00 m\n3\n.s\n\n\u20131\n\nSource: Division of Operation for the Hydroelectric of Jurumirim; modified from Henry (1990) and Nogueira et al.\n(1999).\n\nTABLE 1\nMorphometric characteristics of Jurumirim Reservoir.\n\n\n\nBraz.

During this period\nthere was a remarkable daily variation in the values\nmeasured in the water column. In the rainy season\na relatively low variation in chlorophyll con-\ncentration was observed, except for the first ten\ndays.\n\nThe results of the variance analysis performed\nin order to identify differences between sampling\ndays and between depths are shown in Table 2.\nThere were significant differences, between sam-\npling days for both periods studied. There was no\n\nsignificant variation for vertical distribution of the\nenvironmental variables during the dry season.\nHowever, most variables showed significant\ndifferences in the water column during the rainy\nseason.\n\nCopepoda\nCopepoda is an important group in the zoo-\n\nplankton of Jurumirim Reservoir. They constituted,\nin terms of mean density, 26% and 27% of the total\nzooplankton (Cladocera 6% and 9%; Rotifera 64%\nand 63%) in the dry and rainy season, respectively\n(Panarelli, 1999).

In Fig. 18 presents some selected profiles\non vertical distribution of the main copepods spe-\ncies. A larger number of organisms was found\nwithin the first 20 m of depth during the dry season.\nA higher abundance of T. minutus was found bet-\nween 0 and 10 m.

Numerical dominance\nin the zooplankton community by rotifers was also\nfound in another oligotrophic reservoir, Broa\nReservoir, in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (Matsumura-\nTundisi et al., 1989). Rotifers constituted 65.5%\nof total zooplankton, followed by cladocerans\n\n(17.2%) and copepods (16.9%). However, when\nthese values were expressed in terms of dry weight,\nthe copepods exhibited the largest proportion of\ntotal biomass, 80.8%, followed by cladocerans,\n13.8% and rotifers, &lt;5%.\n\nMajor differences were observed in population\nabundances and dominance between dry and rainy\nperiods, which indicates that seasonal effects are\nimportant factors in the dynamics of these populations.\nThe dominance of Cyclopoida, especially T. minutus\nduring the dry season, and the numerical increase\nof Calanoida, mainly N. iheringi in the rainy season,\nwere probably related to temperature variation and\nthe phytoplankton community structure. The species\nof Calanoida showed a significant correlation with\nwater temperature.\n\nEsp\u00edndola (1994) verified experimentally, that\nthe development of N. iheringi from egg to phase\nnauplius I decreased with temperature increase, from\n4.3 days at 18oC to 1.1 days at 28oC. The deve-\nlopment time from egg to egg significantly\ndecreased as well, from 17.6 days at 23oC to 9.7\ndays at 28oC. At a lower temperature (18oC) there\n\nFig. 13 \u2014 Nauplii, copepodid, and adult proportions of cyclopoid, in the water column of Jurumirim Reservoir.\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 61(4): 577-598\n\n592 PANARELLI, E. A., NOGUEIRA, M. G. and HENRY, R.\n\nFig. 14 \u2014 Mean density of organisms for the species of Calanoida, in the water column of Jurumirim Reservoir.\n\nwas an increase in mortality rate and a decrease\nin reproductive efficiency for these species. These\ndata show that a considerable increase in number\nof copepods can occur due to fast development\nin high temperature conditions. On the other hand,\nRietzler (1995) observed in experiments with T.\nminutus a decrease in longevity with temperature\nincrease, from 37 days at 18oC to 7.7 days at 28oC.\n\nThe results of the experiments mentioned above\nshow that N. iheringi and T. minutus seem to have\nbetter physiologic performance (longevity and\ndevelopment time) in different temperature ranges.\nThis fact contributes to understanding the pattern of\nvariation in calanoid and cyclopoid abundance obser-\nved in the present study, with higher density of\ncalanoids during the rainy season (with temperature\nnear 24.6oC) and higher density of cyclopoids in the\ndry season (temperature near 19.8oC).\n\nHigher proportions of copepodids and adult\ncalanoids observed during the rainy season can be\n\nassociated with greater longevity in high temperature\nconditions. The same can be inferred for cyclopoids\nin lower temperature conditions. The higher density\nof nauplii in possibly adverse conditions (cyclopoid\nin warmer and calanoid in cooler periods) can be\na strategy of these populations for remaing in the\nenvironment with the generation of great numbers\nof descendents, even so a small only a small part\nof these reach the adult phase. Nogueira (1996),\nNogueira &amp; Panarelli (1997), and Mitsuka (1998)\nverified the same variation pattern in the ratio of\nCalanoida/Cyclopoida abundance when compared\nto the dry (winter) and rainy (summer) seasons in\nJurumirim Reservoir. The male/female relation was\nmore stable for N. iheringi in both seasons, with\nsimilar values for male and female density. The male/\nfemale ratio was stable for T. minutus during the\ndry season, but a high was obser ved in the rainy\nseason, when this species was less abundant. Males\nof T. decipiens appeared only sporadically.\n\n\n\nBraz. J.

J. Biol., 61(4): 577-598\n\n596 PANARELLI, E. A., NOGUEIRA, M. G. and HENRY, R.\n\nIn the dry season there was a tendency towards\nspatial segregation between N. iheringi, which\ngenerally occupied superficial layers (between 0\nand 5 m), and the two species of Thermocyclops,\nwhich were more abundant below 5 m.\n\nProbably the species of Cyclopoida are distri-\nbuted preferentially in layers where temperature\nvalues are lower, whereas during the period of iso-\nthermal conditions these species showed higher\nabundances between 0 and 10 m depth. The presence\nof the species of Thermocyclops in deeper layers\nduring the thermal stratification period, also indicates\nthat they can tolerate lower concentrations of dis-\nsolved oxygen, which are observed in the region\nnear the hypolimnion. In a study on vertical mi-\ngration of zooplankton in Jurumirim Reservoir, No-\ngueira &amp; Panarelli (1997) verified preferential\ndistribution of T. minutus in the hypolimnion, espe-\ncially during the day and in stratified conditions.\n\nFerguson et al. (1982) considered temperature\nand food resources as the main factors responsible\nfor changes in population densities and in the age\nstructure of zooplankton communities. The chlo-\nrophyll-a values did not show significant correlation\nwith the zooplanktonic population, however when\nanalyzed the phytoplanktonic groups showed cor-\nrelations mainly in the dry season. For copepods,\nwe should consider that calanoids and cyclopoids\nhave different feeding preferences. Calanoids are\nfilter-feeding and cyclopoids capture alimentary\nparticles. Esteves &amp; Sendacz (1988) suggested that\ncyclopoids can ingest portions of filamentous and\ncolonial algae, which may be inadequate as a food\nresource for the calanoids. On the other hand, Fulton\n(1988), based on experimental results, proposed that\nthe inhibitor effect of blue-green algae for the\ndevelopment of zooplankton, would be more related\nto toxicity than to morphology of these algae. In\nan experimental study on feeding processes of\nArgyrodiaptomus furcatus using five phytoplankton\nspecies, Tavares &amp; Matsumura-Tundisi (1984),\nverified that Scenedesmus quadricaudata was filte-\nred at higher rates than Chlorella zoofingensis,\nalthough the latter species was present in a higher\nconcentration. According to these authors, diffe-\nrences in filtration and assimilation rates for different\nalgae may be associated with differences in nutrient\ncontent and cell morphology, palatability, and even\ntoxicity. Rietzler &amp; Esp\u00edndola (1998) analyzed the\ngut content of copepods and verified for the cy-\n\nclopoids Mesocyclops kieferi and Thermocyclops\ndecipiens ingestion of a high percentage of organic\ndetritus besides consumption of colonies of\nCyanophyceae (mainly Microcystis); for calanoids\n(Notodiaptomus) the main food items were diatoms\nand phytoflagellates. They concluded that colonies\nof Microcystis provided (directly or not) an alter-\nnative food resource for cyclopoids.\n\nDuring the dry season, for the same sampling\ndays, Ferreira (1998) found higher densities of Micro-\ncystis. The capacity of the cyclopoids to use colonies\nof Microcystis, or organic detritus associated with\nthem, can explain their dominance in Jurumirim\nReservoir in this period. Species of Cryptophyceae,\nknown as an edible food resource for zooplankton\n(Klaveness, 1988), were positively correlated with\nA. furcatus during the same season. Significant\ncorrelations between zooplankton and phytoplankton\npopulations were not detected during the rainy season,\ndespite presence of the same species. Therefore,\nabiotic factors may play a determinantal role in the\ndynamics of plankton communities in Jurumirim\nReservoir during certain periods of the year.\n\nShort-term variations in abundance of cala-\nnoids were observed in both periods of the year.\nHowever, for cyclopoids, conspicuous daily varia-\ntions occurred only in the dry season, when out-\nflow was higher (Table 1). Zooplankton opulations\ncan exhibit aggregate patterns of distribution, in\npatches with a large number of organisms. The\nadvective currents as much as the action of the\nwind can promote displacement of these aggre-\ngates of individuals. In spite of unverified direct\nrelation between wind speed and abundance\nvariations, it is important to notice that daily oscil-\nlations in the wind speed occurred and that these\ninduce movements of water masses. In the present\nstudy, the main cause of density variations of\npopulations during short time inter vals was\nprobably the transportation of organisms due to\nwater mass movements, as indicated by great\nchanges observed in density. For instance, the\nfivefold increase in abundance of N. iheringi,\nbetween 7 and 9 July, when water temperature\nwas relatively low (19.5oC), seems incompatible\nwith natural changes in the dynamics of a single\npopulation. According to Esp\u00edndola (1994), in\nthese temperature conditions, increases in mor-\ntality and development time rates for this species\nwould be expected.\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 61(4): 577-598\n\nSHORT-TERM VARIABILITY OF COPEPOD ABUNDANCE IN JURUMIRIM RESERVOIR 597\n\nIn reservoirs with continuous water flow,\ndisplacement of water masses certainly contribute\nto variability in population abundances. Nogueira\n&amp; Panarelli (1997) in studying zooplankton vertical\ndistribution at the dam region of Jurumirim Re-\nservoir, also related a great increase in density with\ndisplacement of adjacent water masses. They ve-\nrified an increase of more than 100% in abundance\nof total zooplankton within an 8-hour interval.\nAccording to Lewis Jr. (1978), some sophisticated\ninformation is available on zooplankton patch\nstructure at given instants in time, but knowledge\nabout the behavior of patch structure in tempo-\nral scales is still not sufficient for better unders-\ntanding the relationship between temporal and\nspatial variation of planktonic populations. The\nmovements of patches of zooplankton can have\nan important role in community dynamics. The\nsame site can be exploited by a large number of\nindividuals at different times, and the same set of\norganisms can exploit several parts of the eco-\nsystem during short periods of time.\n\nSome abiotic variables, such as temperature,\ndissolved oxygen and pH, as well as abundance of\ntaxa of phytoplankton (Ferreira, 1998), showed signi-\nficant variations between days for the same sampling\nperiod. This environmental variability seems to have\ninfluenced organism distribution or even fluctuation\nin abundance of copepod populations, promoting\neither organism increase or decrease in distinct inter-\nvals of time.\n\nOur data showed that variations in abundance\nof copepod populations, within a relatively short\ninterval of time, can be as great as, or even greater\nthan, fluctuations observed in seasonal series. This\nreinforces results obtained by Twombly (1983) and\nPinto-Coelho (1987), who have emphasized the\nimportance of short-term fluctuations in zooplankton\ncommunity dynamics.\n\nOur results also indicate that future inves-\ntigations, in order to contribute to better unders-\ntanding of zooplankton community ecology in\nJurumirim Reservoir, should include some expe-\nrimental work on particular biological and ecolo-\ngical responses of the main zooplankton species\nto a range of variations in some determinantal\nenvironmental variables.\n\nAcknowledgments \u2014 We thank Fapesp (process 91/0612-5 \u2013\nthematic project and 96/3435-0 \u2013 scholarship to the first author)\nfor financial support.
