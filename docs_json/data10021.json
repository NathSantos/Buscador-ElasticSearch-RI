The aim of this study was to characterize the mineralogy\nand micromorphology of soil materials from a representative toposequence of the\nwatershed of the vereda Lagoa do Leandro, located in Minas Novas, state of Minas\nGerais, Brazil, on plains in the region of the upper Jequitinhonha valley, emphasizing\nessential aspects of their genesis and landscape evolution. The toposequence is\nunderlain by rocks of the Maca\u00fabas group and covered with detrital and\nmetamorphic rocks (schists of Proterozoic diamictites). The soil profiles were\nfirst pedologically described; samples of the disturbed and undisturbed soils were\ncollected from all horizons for further micromorphological and mineralogical\nanalyses. The mineralogical analysis was mainly based on powder X ray\ndiffractometry (XRD) and micromorphological descriptions of thin sections under\na petrographic microscope. The soils from the bottom to the top of this\ntoposequence were classified as: Typic Albaquult (GXbd), Xanthic Haplustox, gray\ncolor, here called \u201cGray Haplustox\u201d (\u201cLAC\u201d), Xanthic Haplustox (LA) and Typic\nHaplustox (LVA). The clay mineralogy of all soils was found to be dominated by\nkaolinite. In soil of LA and LVA, the occurrence of goethite, gibbsite, and anatase\nwas evidenced; \u201cLAC\u201d also contained anatase and the GXbd, illite, anatase, and\ntraces of vermiculite. The micromorphological analyses of the LVA, LA and \u201cLAC\u201d\nsoils showed the prevalence of a microaggregate-like or granular microstructure,\n\n(1) Part of the dissertation of first author, presented to the Master\u2019s degree in Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Vegetal of the Universidade Federal dos\nVales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri \u2013 UFVJM.

The original biome was the\nCerrado vegetation and the area was separated by the\nJequitinhonha and Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed River and their affluents.\nSome of these chapadas, which cover over 10,000 ha,\nare drained by streams with swamps (veredas) at their\nsource.\n\nAccording to Campos (1998), the drainage system\nof the upper Jequitinhonha valley is immensely\nimportant for the soil and landscape evolution because\nstructural, tectonic, and lithological factors induced\nchanges in this environment.  Veredas may occur\n\nunder varied hypsometric, lithostratigraphic,\npedologic, and pluviometric conditions (Melo, 1992).\nRed, Red Yellow, Yellow, and gray-colored Latosols\npredominate on the chapadas of the upper\nJequitinhonha; and Gleysols and Plinthosols are found\nin the valleys (Ferreira et al., 2010).\n\nThe mineral material of the dominant soils in the\nCerrado biome is clayey, composed mainly of kaolinite,\niron oxides, gibbsite, and also Ti and quartz oxides\n(Moura Filho &amp; Buol, 1972; Weaver, 1974; Curi &amp;\nFranzmeier, 1984); these in turn reflect the soil\ngenesis and weathering stages, related with the\nlandscape evolution.  Ferreira et al. (2010) characterized\nthe mineralogy of the Latosols on the Jequitinhonha\nplateau, which contain mostly kaolinite and gibbsite\nwith significant crystallinity in the clay fraction.\n\n\n\nHIGHLANDS OF THE UPPER JEQUITINHONHA VALLEY, BRAZIL. II \u2013 MINERALOGY...                 1083\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1081-1091, 2011\n\nDetailed micromorphological studies deepen the\nunderstanding of the origin of soils (Brewer, 1976).\nSuch studies have demonstrated clay illuviation/\neluviation, microaggregation, and pore quantity and\nsize distribution as soil forming processes (Bullock et\nal., 1985), which are also related with the landscape\nevolution.\n\nThe purpose of this paper was to study the\nmicromorphology and identify the mineral material\nof the clay fraction of soils in a representative\ntoposequence of a highland swamp (vereda located on\na chapada) of the upper Jequitinhonha valley, MG,\nfocused on the genesis and relation with the landscape\nevolution.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nLocation, geomorphology, and geology\n\nThe studied soils are part of a toposequence in the\nVereda Lagoa do Leandro, in the municipality of\nMinas Novas, Alto Vale do Jequitinhonha, Minas\nGerais State, Brazil (latitude 17 \u00ba 19 \u2019 to 17 \u00b0 20 \u2019\nSouth, longitude 42 \u00ba 28 \u2019 to 42 \u00b0 29 \u2019 West).\n\nThe region around Minas Novas is drained by the\nAra\u00e7ua\u00ed, Fanado, Capivari, and Setubal rivers.  There\nare two hydrogeological domains: Cenozoic dendritic\ncover, and Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks (CPRM,\n2005).\n\nThe planation surface on the Jequitinhonha plateau\nwas formed in the Lower or Middle Tertiary Period,\nand originated the current chapadas, which are\nunderlain by lithologies of the Maca\u00fabas group; the\nsummits are flattened and were fragmented by intense\ndissection of the landscape.  There are Cenozoic\ndendritic-lateritic sediments in these dissected areas,\nconverging to the Fanado and Capivari river basins\n(Minas Gerais, 1982; Campos, 1998).\n\nA deep pedologic cover on the chapadas facilitates\nwater infiltration; part of this water supplies deep\nregional water tables, and another part rises to the\nsurface as localized surface flow in the lower portions\nof the chapadas; the headwaters are commonly named\n\u201cveredas\u201d (Projeto RADAMMINAS, 1977).\n\nThe planation surfaces of the Lower or Middle\nTertiary Periods overlay Proterozoic diamictite schists\n(Minas Gerais, 1982; Campos, 1998).  This author\nalso claims that this region defines the beginning of\nthe caatinga vegetation in the State of Minas Gerais.\n\nThe Maca\u00fabas lithology is a pre-Cambrian\nNeoproterozoic sedimentary sequence consisting of\nquartz-biotite-schists with interbedded quartzite,\nconglomerates, philites, limestone lenses,\namphibolites and green schists, underlying the\nevolution of the regional terrain (Pedrosa Soares,\n1996).\n\nField work\nBased on the Brazilian Soil Classification System\n\n(Embrapa, 2006), four profiles representing the\nlandscape (top, mid-slope, foot slope, and bottom of\nthe vereda) were described in a toposequence on the\nhillside of the Lagoa do Leandro microbasin in the\nupper Jequitinhonha valley: top \u2013 typical dystrophic\nRed Yellow Latosol (LVA); mid-slope \u2013 typical\ndystrophic Yellow Latosol (LA); foot slope \u2013 grayish\ncolored dystrophic Yellow Latosol, here named\ndystrophic \u201cGrayish Latosol\u201d (\u201cLAC\u201d); and the base of\nthe vereda \u2013 argisol dystrophic tb Haplic Gleysol\n(GXbd).  Based on the Soil Taxonomy (United States,\n1975) the same soil profiles were classified, respectively,\nas: Typic Haplustox (LVA), Xanthic Haplustox (LA),\nXanthic Haplustox, gray color, here called \u201cGray\nHaplustox\u201d (\u201cLAC\u201d) and Typic Albaquult (GXbd).\n\nThe soils sampled in trenches in horizons were\ndescribed morphologically, according to Santos et al.\n(2005).  Disturbed samples were collected for mineral\nmaterial analysis of B horizons, since there was no\nmineralogical variation across the layers, and non-\ndisturbed samples preferably of the A and B or\ntransition horizons for micromorphological analyses.\nThe aim was to sample a surface layer (affected by\norganic matter) and a subsurface (diagnostic) horizon.\n\nLaboratory work\n\nMineralogical analyses\n\nThe mineral material of the clay fraction was\nanalyzed by X ray diffraction (XRD).  Samples were\nprepared and the mineral material of the clay fraction\ndetremined according to Jackson (1975).  Samples were\ntreated according to K\u00e4mpf &amp; Schwertmann, (1982),\nusing a method modified by Singh &amp; Gilkes (1991) for\nconcentrates to identify iron oxides.\n\nDiffraction X ray was carried out using a Shimadzu\nXRD 6000 diffractometer with a copper anode and\ncoupled graphite crystal monochromator, operating\nat 40 kv and 20 mA.  Samples were diffracted in the\nform of aggregates on slides, scanned in 3\u201335 \u00ba2?\nintervals at a speed of 1.5 \u00ba2? min-1 in continuous\nmode.  Natural clay and oxide concentrates were\nanalyzed as non-oriented dust scanned in 3\u201370 \u00b02?\nintervals, also at 1.5 \u00ba2? min-1 in continuous mode.\n\nThe criteria for interpreting diffractograms and\nidentifying the mineral material of the clay fraction\nwere based on interplanar (d) spacing and the\ndiffraction peaks following thermal and saturation\ntreatments, as described by Jackson (1975), Brown &amp;\nBrindley (1980), and Moore &amp; Reynolds (1989).\n\nMicromorphological analyses\n\nNon-disturbed samples were collected on card paper\ncovered with film paper to maintain the structural\nintegrity.  The samples were then impregnated with\na 1.0 # 08 crystal resin + styrene monomer +\nfluorescent pigment and catalyzer, after which the\n\n\n\n1084 F\u00e1bio Henrique Alves Bispo et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1081-1091, 2011\n\nsections were polished, glued onto glass slides, and\nagain sectioned and polished to the ideal thickness\nfor micromorphological analysis, as recommended by\nMurphy (1986).  The thin sections were analyzed under\na Zeiss petrographic microscope and described\naccording to Bullock et al. (1985), Brewer (1976), and\nStoops &amp; Jongerius (1975).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nCharacterizing the mineralogy\n\nThe mineral material of the clay fraction in all\nstudy soils consisted mostly of kaolinite (K), with some\ntitanium oxide occurrences (Anatase - An), as often\nobserved in regions with latosols (Curi &amp; Franzmeier,\n1984) (Figures 1 to 4).  Goethite (Gh) and gibbsite (Gb)\nmay be found in LA and LVA (Figures 3 and 4).  Illite\n(I) and a low intensity diffraction peak corresponding\nto the basal spacing of vermiculite (V) was found in\nthe Btg2 horizon of the GXbd (Figure 1).\n\nKaolinite was found by the presence of diffraction\npeaks at basal spacings of 0.722 nm (12.24 \u00b02? d001)\nand 0.359 nm (24.74 \u00b02? d002), which collapsed after\nheating to 550 \u00baC.  Heating the sample to 550 \u00b0C causes\ndestruction of Al oxides and collapse of this mineral.\nThe presence of 1.026 nm (8.61 \u00b02? d001), 0.505 nm\n(17.52 \u00b02? d001), and 0.336 nm (26.48 \u00b02? d001)\ndiffraction peaks indicated the presence of illite\n(Figure 1).  Anatase was found at a 0.351 nm (25.3\n\u00b02? d101) diffraction peak, which becomes clear after\nheating the oxide concentrate to 550 \u00baC (Figures 1 to\n4).  Vermiculite was found in the GXbd because of a\nweak 1.4 nm (6.3 \u00b02? d001) diffraction peak that was\nnot displaced after treatment with glycerol, and which\n\ncollapsed after heating to 550 \u00baC (Figure 1).  Diffraction\npeaks at 0.483 nm (18.35 \u00b02? d001) and 0.437 nm\n(20.3 \u00b02? d001) indicated the presence of gibbsite.\nGoethite was found because of 0.416 nm\n(21.34 \u00b02? d001) and 0.269 nm (33.25 \u00b02? d001)\ndiffraction peaks, which collapsed after thermal\ntreatment at 350 \u00baC (Figures 3 and 4).\n\nKaolinite was predominant in the Btg2 horizon of\nthe GXbd; there were occurrences of illite and traces\nof vermiculite.  This material was concordant with\nthe Ki &lt;2.0 and pH &lt;5.0 values for all horizons of\nthis soil type (Melo, 1992; Bispo, 2010) also found 2:1\ntraces of minerals at the bottom of veredas on a plateau\nin northwestern Minas Gerais.\n\nAccording to Mala (2002), vermiculite formation\nmay be associated with alteration in micaceous or\nfeldspathic minerals.  According to Ramos (2000), the\noccurrence of vermiculite traces in waterlogged soils\nof the vereda may be explained by stagnant water\nthat results in less intense weathering and\nneoformation of these minerals under the effect of\nsilica and bases.\n\nHorizons Bw in LA and LVA consist essentially of\nkaolinite, goethite, and gibbsite, which are typical clay\nminerals formed under intense weathering conditions\nand excellent drainage.  Low Ki values and a low Feo/\nFed ratio support these results.  Iron oxides were not\nfound in the \u201cLAC\u201d, which is supported by a low content\nof Feo and Fed and a much higher Feo/Fed ratio than\nin the LA and LVA, and at a lower ratio than that of\nGXbd (Bispo, 2010).\n\nK\u00e4mpf &amp; Schwertmann (1983) have suggested that\nincreased moisture and lower pH values in LA and\n\nFigure 2.

Solo, 35:1081-1091, 2011\n\nLVA profiles result in (hydrated) goethite rather than\n(dehydrated) hematite formation.  Ferreira et al.\n(2010) found no Fe oxides either in a gray latosol profile\nin the upper Jequitinhonha region.\n\nThe Latosols of the Lagoa do Leandro swamp are\nformed by pre-weathered materials (in prior  weathering\ncycles) which, in association with the current terrain\nand climate, are at an advanced weathering stage;\nthus they are essentially kaolinitic and oxidic.\n\nMicromorphology\n\nThe A horizon of GXbd is homogeneous; it contains\na single porphyric-enaulic zone.  The microstructure\nconsists of subangular, prismatic, and microgranulated\nblocks (Figure 5a).  The plasma is black-reddish and\nisoptic, probably because of organic matter.  The\npredominantly inter-aggregate porosity has a stacked/\npacked structure, with some filled biological cavities,\nchannels, and microfissures (Figure 5b).  Pedologic\nfeatures such as quartz-containing orthotubules,\norganic matter, micro-aggregates, and empty\npedotubules may be found.  There are also many roots\nalong this horizon.\n\nThe Btg2 horizon of the GXbd is homogeneous.\nThere is a dense porphyric zone with a microstructure\nof prismatic and subangular polyhedral aggregates\n(subangular blocks), confirming the morphological\ndescription of its structure.  The plasma is gray isoptic\nand predominant cavity porosity (inter-aggregates);\nthere are also chambers and microfissures.  The\nmicrostructure of these soils is typically prismatic.\nThere are also illuvial ferriargillan and cutans\n(Figure 5c) composed of illuvial clay and unfilled\npedotubules in small quantities.  These cutans and\nferriargillans are evidence of the occurrence of\nargilluviation in the GXbd, as proposed by Ranst &amp;\nConinck (2002), and help explain the high B/A texture\ngradient found in these soils.\n\nAccording to Cooper &amp; Vidal-Torrado (2000), the\nmain processes that form textural B horizons are clay\ntranslocation and deposition in pores as illuvial cutans.\nFedoroff &amp; Eswaran (1985) also suggested that illuvial\ncutans are the main feature for classifying textural B\nhorizons.\n\nThe Bw2 horizon of the \u201cLAC\u201d is homogeneous and\ncontains a single porphyric-enaulic zone, which\nconsists mostly of a dense microgranulated\nmicrostructure with a granular substructure\n(Figure 6b).  The inter-aggregate porosity consists of\ncavities and chambers, and the plasma is isoptic gray-\nyellow.  Iron compound-filled orthotubules were found\nas well as a few rounded elongated iron nodules in\nregions of mottling.  Coal fragments are found\nconstantly in this horizon (Figure 6a), showing that\nthe plant cover of this soil had been burned, with the\nlikelihood of root carbonization.  These fires probably\noccurred following landscape dissection because of\nimproved drainage conditions in the current position\nof the foot of the slope.  The microgranulated\nmicrostructure suggests an effect of the fauna and\ndemonstrated the latosolic nature of this horizon.\nFerreira et al. (2010) published similar descriptions\nfor a gray latosol in the region of Itamarandiba (MG).\n\nThe granular microstructure described by Bullock\net al. (1985) may be observed in the \u201cLAC\u201d, and\nindicates a typical latosol structure, especially in more\nweathered soils (Buol &amp; Eswaran, 1978).  Another\nfeature of latosols found in the \u201cLAC\u201d is isoptic plasma\n(Brewer, 1976).\n\nFigure 3.

The plasma was yellow red isoptic,\nand interaggregate porosity was predominantly\nstructured by stacking with a few biological cavities\nand microfissures.

The plasma is red isoptic.\nAgrotubules are filled with clay, quartz, and Fe oxides;\niron nodules are an additional pedological feature.\n\nThe micromorphological features of the horizons\nof these latosols are similar to those reported by\nAndrade et al. (1997) and Silva &amp; Vidal-Torrado (1999).\n\nOrigin of soils in the toposequence\n\nThe presence of illite and vermiculite traces in the\nBtg2 horizon of the GXbd (Figure 1) is evidence of drier\n\nFigure 7.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1081-1091, 2011\n\nperiods, as illite is formed when there is more\nevaporation (dry seasons) in sedimentary environments\n(Thompson &amp; Ukrainczyk, 2002).  Further evidence\nis provided by the argisolic nature of the GXbd.\n\nBuol et al. (1980), Vidal-Torrado &amp; Lepsch (1993),\nand Breemen &amp; Buurman (2002) have suggested that\none of the main B/A texture differentiating processes\nin soil profiles is the movement of suspended clays\nfrom surface to subsurface horizons.  To make clay\nmigrate downwards across profiles, aggregates must\nbreak apart by a sudden entry of water into the\naggregate pores, resulting in explosion of the\naggregates by the air leaving the pores.  Rupture is\nmore common when seasonality is significant, with\nwell-defined dry periods when soils dry out completely,\nand short wet periods with intense rains that quickly\nsaturate the soil, thereby \u201cexploding\u201d the aggregates.\nThus, argilluviation in the GXbd as shown by the\npresence of illuviation cutans (Figure 5c) and\nferriargilans is strong evidence of a past climate with\na pronounced dry season and torrential rains at the\nbeginning of a short wet period (Breemen &amp; Buurman,\n2002) in the Lagoa do Leandro swamp region.  This\nstructure was preserved because a change to a wetter\nclimate raised the water table in this soil, minimizing\nthe homogenizing effect of biological activity in the profile.\n\nIn the current climate, ferrolysis may have further\nincreased the B/A textural differentiation observed in\nthe GXbd.  This horizon is water-saturated during\nthe rainy season, and dries out during the dry season.\nWater saturation reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+, which displaces\nthe cations from the exchange complex, thereby\nreducing the pH.  In the dry season, oxidation of Fe2+\nto Fe3+ causes H+ formation, resulting in a further\npH decrease; H+ then penetrates the surface of silicate\nclay (K, I, and V \u2013 Figure 1), changing positions with\nthe Al in its octahedrons, resulting in their break up\n(Brinkman, 1970; Breemen &amp; Buurman, 2002; Ranst\n&amp; Conick, 2002).  This soil-forming process may have\ncontributed significantly to the clay destruction in the\nA horizon of GXbd.\n\nGood drainage in the LVA and the LA favor profile\nhomogenization due to the fauna activity in soils.  In\nthe \u201cLAC\u201d, landscape dissection the helped improve\ndrainage, and the fauna homogenized the profile.  The\npresence of coal fragments in the Bw2 horizon of the\n\u201cLAC\u201d (Figure 6a) suggests that the plant cover of\nthis soil had been affected \u2013 and remains exposed to \u2013\nfires, which carbonized mainly the roots.  These fires\ncan only have occurred after landscape dissection and\nthe resulting improved drainage conditions.  A\nmicrogranulated microstructure suggests the effect\nof the fauna, and is evidence of the Latosolic nature of\nthis horizon.\n\nLandscape evolution and origin of soils in the\nLagoa do Leandro swamp\n\nThe chapadas of the upper Jequitinhonha valley\nextend over 10,000 to 40,000 ha and are separated by\n\ndissected areas.  In the region of Minas Novas (MG),\nchapadas contain drained microbasins in oval, pear-\nshaped, depressed areas named veredas.\n\nFigure 9 presents a model of the evolution of\nvereda-drained microbasins on the chapadas of the\nupper Jequitinhonha region.  Field work, satellite\nimages, and geomorphological studies (King, 1956;\nBoaventura, 1978; Saadi, 1995; Campos, 1998; Motta\net al., 2002) played important roles in developing the\nmodel and understanding the current landscape.\n\nThe regional terrain was formed on a uniformly\nflattened surface during a prolonged period in the\nLower Tertiary (Figure 9a); it corresponds to a\npeneplan resulting from the South American erosion\ncycle (King, 1956).  Chapadas at 800 to 1,000 m asl\nare evidence of the relief imposed by the South\nAmerican Surface (Saadi, 1995).\n\nThe oval shape of the vereda of the Lagoa do\nLeandro microbasin may have been originated by\n\u201cgeochemical dissolution\u201d processes (Lima &amp; Queiroz\nNeto, 1996) associated with erosion (Figure 9b).\n\u201cGeochemical dissolution\u201d may have occurred due to\nthe presence of less weathering-resistant minerals in\nthe parent material (Maca\u00fabas).  A low-grade drainage\nnetwork dissected the chapadas during the Tertiary\nperiod, (Figure 9c).\n\nThe chapadas in the region of Minas Novas (MG)\nare a more recent dissection, compared to those studied\nby Ferreira et al. (2010).  The soil distribution in the\n\nFigure 9. Proposed model of landscape evolution of\ndrained vereda-microbasins on highlands of the\nJequitinhonha plateau.\n\n\n\nHIGHLANDS OF THE UPPER JEQUITINHONHA VALLEY, BRAZIL. II \u2013 MINERALOGY...                 1089\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1081-1091, 2011\n\nLagoa do Leandro microbasin appears to be significant\nevidence of the current drainage network.  The\noccurrence of Latosols (Figure 9d) is similar to that\nfound on surface I, as described by Motta et al. (2002),\nfor soils of the Brazilian Central Plateau, which is in\nturn related with the South American Surface as\ndescribed by King (1956).\n\nThe soils of the vereda underwent an intense\ndeferrification process, resulting in grayish colors;\nunlike on the chapadas, where reddish or yellowish\nsoils predominate, due to better drainage (UFV, 1980).\nThe color of the B horizon of Latosols in the microbasin\nunder study is yellowish and burnished and can be\ngrayish at the base of the vereda.\n\nOn gently undulated areas that correspond to the\n\u201cLAC\u201d, alternating reduction and oxidation because\nof water table oscillations in the swamp led to mottling\nin the subsurface of this soil.  Gleysolization of the\nGXbd probably occurred because of permanent water\nsaturation during most of the Pleistocene, interrupted\nby dry periods (Salgado-Labouriau et al., 1998).\n\nIn the \u201cLAC\u201d, formed in lower and poorly drained\nareas of the landscape during the Pleistocene (Ferreira\net al., 2010), drainage improved gradually, but the\ngrayish colors remained as probably almost all Fe3+\nwas removed during the long period under reducing\nconditions (Schwertmann &amp; Taylor, 1989;\nPeterschmitt et al., 1996; K\u00e4mpf &amp; Curi, 2000).\n\nAs drainage improved, the action of the\nbioturbating fauna (ants, termites, and annelids) in\nthe pedologic cover may have been intensified, changing\nthe blocky structure of old gleysolized soils into a\ngranulated structure (Figure 6b).  These Gleysols were\ngradually latosolized by biological and chemical\nprocesses; however, as the grayish colors were not\nlost, they originated the gray Latosols, or \u201cLAC\u201d\n(Ferreira et al., 2010).\n\nThus, Argisols may have been formed during\nclimates with more pronounced dry seasons and\ntorrential rains at the beginning of short wet seasons,\n(Breemen &amp; Buurman, 2002).  Drainage lines became\ndeeper and soils in higher parts of microbasins that\ndrain to the veredas may have become homogenized\nby the action of the soil fauna supported by the wet\nclimate during the more humid Pleistocene period.\nAs dissection progressed, soil drainage in lower\nportions of the past landscape improved, and the fauna\ncaused material to become homogeneous and formed\nmicroaggregates \u2013 latosolizing the ancient\nhydromorphic soils.\n\nThe current veredas would have formed in the\nnewer, more depressed parts of the landscape, a result\nof the interconnection of circular depressions\n(exudation points) located in poorly drained areas on\nthe chapadas.  At these sites, Gleysols are currently\nfound, preserving evidence of dry periods or inherited\nmaterial, such as illite and vermiculite in the clay\nfraction, and illuvial cutans and ferriargilans in the\n\nBtg horizon.  Ferrolysis in horizon A would have\ncontributed significantly to a high texture gradient\nbetween horizons A and B.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. Paleogleysols were latolized by excavating fauna/\nbioturbating fauna and gave rise to the current LACs.\n\n2. The past seasonal climate and current ferrolysis\nare evidence of a high B/A texture gradient in Haplic\nGleysols.\n\n3. Haplic Gleysols at the base of the vereda conserve\noriginal physical, mineralogical, and micromorphological\nfeatures of their formation during dry periods.\n\n4. The soils and landscape of the Lagoa do Leandro\nswamp were formed and developed together with a\ndrainage network that is related with Pleistocene\nclimate changes.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors are indebted to the company\nArcelorMittal S.A, the Brazilian Federal Agency for\nSupport and Evaluation of Graduate Education\n(CAPES), and the Research Foundation of the state of\nMinas Gerais (FAPEMIG) for funding for this study.\nIn particular, they wish to thank professor Valdomiro\nSeverino da Souza J\u00fanior, lecturer at the Universidade\nFederal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE), for his\nsuggestions for the mineralogical analyses and support\nin interpreting the results.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nANDRADE, H.; SCHAEFER, C.E.; DEMATT\u00ca, J.L.I. &amp;\nANDRADE, F.V.
