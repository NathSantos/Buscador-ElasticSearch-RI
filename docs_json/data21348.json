L. B. Methodology for definition of new operating sectors for DP \nassisted offloading operations in spread-moored platforms. 2017. 142 p. Thesis \n(Master\u2019s Degree) \u2013 Naval architecture and Marine engineering department of \n\nUniversity of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, 2017.  \n\n \n\nThis thesis defines and applies a methodology for analyzing the possibility of \n\nextending the operating sector of DP shuttle tankers for offloading operations in \n\nSpread Moored FPSO Platforms. Extending the operating sector is beneficial to \n\nincrease operations\u2019 availability and to reduce DP power demand under certain \n\nenvironmental conditions. This study is important, since several emergency \n\ndisconnections have occurred during offloading in Santos Basin because the shuttle \n\ntanker was pushed out of the green sector by environmental resultants that pointed \n\nto the West. However, this proposal has to be carefully analyzed in order to \n\nguarantee the operations\u2019 safety and not to increase the risks of collision between \n\nFPSO and shuttle tanker, of oil pollution and of personnel safety. The methodology \n\nconsists in five basic steps: Preliminary Risk Analysis to assess the potential hazards \n\nassociated with the new sector; evaluation of the uptime gain through static analysis; \n\nevaluation of DP power demand inside the original and extended sector; real time \n\nsimulations to evaluate the operation in a realistic environment; and, finally, field tests \n\nto validate the proposal. This thesis presents the contextualization of the problem, a \n\nbibliographical research, theoretical concepts, the detailed methodology and results \n\nof each step. The results show that the average uptime gain is significant both in \n\nCampos and Santos Basins \u2013 up to 9% and 13% respectively \u2013 and that the \n\nadditional risks created by the sector extension are well mitigated if some \n\nrecommendations are put into place. The conclusion of this thesis is that extending \n\nthe operating sector is not only beneficial but also safe. \n\n \n\nKeywords: offloading, DPST, Dynamic Positioning, shuttle tanker, FPSO.  \n\n

In these types of system, \n\nthe Christmas tree (set of valves controlling the well production) and processing units \n\nare positioned above water level on the platform\u2019s deck, which is called dry \n\ncompletion, and the produced oil flows through subsea pipelines to the onshore \n\nterminals. \n\nAlong with the technology of fixed units, a series of drilling platform technologies \n\nwas developed - including rigs on barges, on ships, on semi-submersible platforms \n\n(SS) and jack-ups (self-elevating units) - which allowed the continued expansion of \n\noffshore activity. \n\nThus, at the beginning of the 80s it became clear that although there was seismic \n\nand drilling technology to operate in deep water, the same did not occur with the \n\nproduction technologies. Fixed production systems have assumed increasing \n\ndimensions and their costs tend to increase exponentially with increased water \n\ndepth.  \n\nA number of solutions were proposed to overcome this problem, including \n\ncompliant tower platforms, articulated towers and tension leg platforms (TLP). The \n\nlatter started to gain importance in the exploration and production activities in the \n\nGulf of Mexico and the North Sea as it allowed to be installed in deeper fields and still \n\nkeeping dry completion. \n\nThe first applications of wet completion technology, in which the Christmas tree \n\nare installed underwater lying on the seabed, were introduced in the North Sea. It \n\nwas in this region that the first floating production systems (FPS) were developed, \n\nduring the 70s (Furtado, 1996), but only in the 80/90 decades that the first floating \n\nunits with wet completion were implemented. \n\nThe uprising of the concept of semi-submersible production units overcame the \n\nbarrier of deep water and allowed reaching even ultra-deep waters. PETROBRAS \n\ninstalled the first SS in Brazil in 1983, in Corvina oil field whose depth is 230m. \n\nEven though the SSs have represented an important development for the \n\noffshore activities, oil field discoveries in more distant areas from the coast have \n\nimposed major challenges with regard to the transportation of produced oil to the \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nshore. The SSs, as well as the fixed units, are designed to treat the oil extracted from \n\nthe well and then transfer it to the onshore terminals by major underwater pipelines. \n\nThe increasing distance of the oil fields to the coast makes the projects of underwater \n\npipelines ever more complicated and costly.  \n\nTherefore, the concepts of Floating Storage and Offloading units, (FSO), and of \n\nFloating Production Storage and Offloading units (FPSO) started to gain more \n\nimportance. The first consists of an anchored tanker that stores the oil produced by \n\nother platforms in its cargo tanks inside the hull and exports it to a ship called shuttle \n\ntanker \u2013 in an operation called offloading \u2013 that transports it to the coast. The second \n\nconsists of a more complete and independent unit, which produces the oil extracted \n\nfrom the well, stores it in its cargo tanks and performs the offloading. Figure 1-1 \n\nbelow shows examples of FSO and FPSO units. It is possible to differentiate easily \n\nthe two types of units because FPSOs present several facilities installed on the \n\ntopsides \u2013 which is the production plant \u2013 while the FSOs present a not so congested \n\nmain deck, because they do not need a production plant.  \n\n \nFigure 1-1: P-38 (FSO) on the left and P-50 (FPSO) on the right \n\n  \nS o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s   \n \n\nThe first FPSO in the world, Shell Castellon, was installed in 1977 in the \n\nMediterranean Sea (Offshore Post, 2017). In Brazil, the first FPSO was installed in \n\n1979 as an early production system, but the boom of FPSO construction and \n\ninstallation only happened at the beginning of the 90s due to the increased \n\nproduction of Campos Basin (Henriques and Brand\u00e3o, 2007). This concept has \n\nbecome so important in the offshore industry that more than 150 units are now \n\noperating worldwide being 30 units in Brazil. \n\nOver the years, PETROBRAS has demonstrated its great preference for FPSOs \n\nfor oil exploration, especially in Santos Basin (BS), a region where part of the \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nBrazilian pre-salt is found, where the fields are located up to 300 km from the coast \n\nand water depths are up to 2,500 m. Only 16 semi-submersible units make part of \n\nPETROBRAS fleet and, until 2020, 20 more FPSO units will be installed in Santos \n\nand other basins (PETROBRAS, 2015a).  \n\n1.1 FPSO mooring systems \n\nIt is important to define the two types of FPSO mooring systems that can be \n\nfound in the industry: Single Point Mooring (SPM) and Spread Mooring System \n\n(SMS). The definition is important, because depending on the mooring system the oil \n\nexport operations are performed with different types of tankers, as it will be explained \n\nin section 1.2, and this study concerns FPSOs moored with Spread Mooring System \n\nonly. \n\nThe first type of mooring, the SPM, consists in an assembly of bearings and \n\nswivels, that is integrated into a vessel\u2019s hull (internally, as shown in Figure 1-2, or \n\nexternally, as shown in Figure 1-3) and permanently fixed to the seabed by means of \n\na mooring system or a fixed structure. The bearing system allows the vessel to \n\nweathervane, i.e., rotate around the fixed part. The risers that bring the oil up from \n\nthe well to the FPSO are connected to the swivels. They can be seen in Figure 1-2 \n\nas yellow lines (white lines are mooring lines, yellow lines are risers or injection lines \n\nand black lines are umbilicals). \n\n  \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nFigure 1-2: Single Point Mooring \u2013 internal arrangement  \n\n \nS o u rc e : (S c a n m a tic , 2 0 1 6 ) \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1-3: Single Point Mooring \u2013 external arrangement \n\n \nS o u rc e : (P e tr\u00f3 le o  e  C o n s tru \u00e7 \u00e3 o  N a v a l, 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\nThe second type of mooring, SMS, consists in a multi-point system that moor \n\nvessels to the seabed using multiple mooring lines. They are usually composed by \n\nfour clusters of mooring lines tied to each corner of FPSO and to the seabed as \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nshown in Figure 1-4. This system, in the other hand, does not allow the FPSO to \n\nweathervane, i.e., its heading is permanently fixed, and in this configuration, the \n\nrisers are connected to the FPSO through the riser balcony, which is located at \n\nportside, on the side of the hull. \n\n \nFigure 1-4: Spread Mooring System (SMS) \n\n \nSource: (2b1 Consulting, 2016) \n\n \n\nAlthough the SMS presents the disadvantage of needing more mooring lines \n\nthan the SPM (because the fixed heading implies greater mooring tensions to hold \n\nthe FPSO in place), the SMS presents other advantages that made it largely \n\npreferred by PETROBRAS to every new FPSO. \n\nFirstly, it demands less maintenance than the SPM, because the mooring lines \n\nonly need to be re-tensioned from time to time, while bearings of the SPM need very \n\ncareful lubrication. Any failure on this process might cause major damages to the \n\nbearings and it may cause clamping, which means losing the ability to weathervane. \n\nIf major repairs on that system are needed, as for example, replacement of the \n\nbearings, this might mean the need of bringing the FPSO back to a shipyard to fix it. \n\nThis would generate a millionaire loss for the operator and it is an alternative that is \n\ncompletely off the table.  \n\nSecond important advantage that made the SMS be the most used mooring \n\nsystem in PETROBRAS is that the riser balcony allows the connection of more risers, \n\ninjection lines and umbilicals. A normal SPM accommodates about 30 slots for lines \n\nconnection and the biggest one in the world accommodates 75 slots. A normal riser \n\nbalcony, on the other hand, can accommodate around 100 slots. Hence, the \n\nproduction capacity on a SMS FPSO may be higher than a SPM one. For this \n\nreason, today, in PETROBRAS fleet, 22 F(P)SOs are spread moored and only 11 are \n\nsingle point moored.  \n\nRiser Balcony \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n1.2 Oil export from FPSO units  \n\nThe oil stored in the F(P)SO must be transported to the coast by a tanker, or a \n\nshuttle tanker (ST), which navigates to the location of the platform and receives the \n\noil through a string of flexible hoses. This operation can be performed in two ways: \n\nthrough a Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring (CALM) buoy or directly from the FPSO, \n\nwhich is known as tandem offloading. \n\nThe CALM buoy is a floating structure anchored to the seabed and connected to \n\nthe FPSO by submarine hoses (see Figure 1-5). Its facilities include a hawser, which \n\nis generally a nylon rope, to which the tanker can moor, and a string of floating hoses \n\nthat connects to the tanker\u2019s midship manifold through which the oil will be \n\ntransferred. \n\n \nFigure 1-5: CALM buoy for offloading with conventional tankers \n\n \nS o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  \n\n \n\nTraditionally in Brazil, the CALM buoy is used in port terminals for loading and \n\nunloading oil. The operation takes place in sheltered waters using conventional \n\ntankers.  \n\nAlthough the CALM buoy is able to operate with any conventional tanker, it \n\npresents serious disadvantages in terms of personnel and environment safety. The \n\nactivities of hoisting the hose and its connection to the midship manifold are manual \n\ntasks without any automation. During the connection, the workers are closely \n\n\n\n 24 \n\npositioned to a hoisted element that presents many hazards such as fingers or arms \n\nclamping or even crushing to death if the crew is not properly trained. Man overboard \n\nis another serious hazard in the operation since it happens through the side shell of \n\nthe hull. Figure 1-6 and Figure 1-7 below illustrate the moment of lifting the hose and \n\nthe connection to the midship manifold in a conventional shuttle tanker. These \n\npictures were actually taken during a tandem offloading in a SPM FSO, but the \n\noperation is very similar to that of a CALM buoy. \n\n \nFigure 1-6: Hose lifting in conventional shuttle tankers. \n\n \nS o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  \n\n \nFigure 1-7: Hose connection to midship manifold in conventional shuttle tankers. \n\n \nS o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  \n\n \n\nIn terms of environmental risks, the midship connection does not present any \n\npossibility of quick disconnection between the tanker and the hose string. Hence, an \n\nundesired event such as hawser rupture may cause hose string rupture and \n\nconsequent oil pollution. \n\nOperation with offshore CALM buoys offers, therefore, in the Brazilian context, \n\neven greater risks to workers and environment, as the operations would take place \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nunder adverse environmental conditions and using exactly the same type of vessel, \n\nequipment and personnel. For this reason, PETROBRAS operates four CALM buoys \n\nonly, in port terminals, and is installing another one in Campos Basin for offloading in \n\nshallow water (90 m). \n\nThe offloading in tandem is the most frequently used in F(P)SOs in Brazil. Single \n\nPoint Mooring units have one offloading station at the stern and Spread Moored units \n\nhave two offloading stations, one at the bow and one at the stern, where the flexible \n\nhoses are stored either elongated over a chute or wounded onto reels (see Figure \n\n1-8), the last being the most common alternative. \n \n\nFigure 1-8: FPSO hose string storage in chute system (left) and reel (right)  \n\n \nS o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  (rig h t) a n d  O ffs h o re  T e c h n o lo g y  (2 0 1 6 ) (le ft)  \n\n \n\nIn this operation, the tanker approaches the production unit at about 80m away \n\nso that the platform personnel shoots a messenger line to be used to hoist the \n\nhawser and the hose string from the FPSO to the tanker. At this point, depending on \n\nthe tanker used, the sequence of activities varies. \n\nFor SPM F(P)SOs in Campos Basin, it is still common to use conventional \n\ntankers, because the production unit and the tanker tend to be aligned with the \n\nenvironmental conditions at all times, which reduces the risk of collisions between \n\nthem. However, the activities of hose connection to the midship manifold of the \n\ntanker are the same as on the operation of a CALM buoy earlier described, and the \n\nrisk to workers is still too high. \n\nFor Spread Moored FPSOs, which do not align with the environmental conditions \n\nbecause of its fixed heading, the risk of operation with conventional vessels is \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nconsidered not tolerable by PETROBRAS, because in case of a sudden change in \n\nthe weather the tanker would not be able to keep position and there would be not \n\nenough time to disconnect the offloading hoses and avoid collision of both vessels. \n\nFor this reason, SMS FPSOs operate only with Dynamically Positioned Shuttle \n\nTankers (DPSTs), or simply Shuttle Tankers (ST), which are better described in \n\nsection 1.3. \n\n1.3 DP shuttle tankers  \n\nThe Dynamic Positioning System (DP system or simply DPS) is a system that \n\nautomatically controls the heading and position of a vessel by means of active \n\npropulsion. It consists in a complex control system composed by four subsystems: a \n\nset of sensors for the detection of position, course, heading and environmental \nconditions, a central control module \u2013 which processes the information received \nfrom sensors, estimates the environmental forces acting on the ship and calculates \n\nthe necessary thrusts to keep it in a certain position \u2013 a propulsion system \u2013 which \nreceives the central control commands and drives the thrusters to obtain the desired \n\nforces and returns the feedback of the actions to the controller \u2013 and finally a \n\ngeneration and distribution system - that feeds electric power to all the other \nsystems. Figure 1-9 extracted from Eriksen, Harms and McDonnell (1999), illustrates \n\nhow these systems are interrelated. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nFigure 1-9: General arrangement of a Dynamic Positioning System  \n\n \nS o u rc e : (E rik s e n , H a rm s  a n d  M c D o n n e ll, 1 9 9 9 ) \n\n \n\nAmong the available DP vessels on the market, there are several types of \n\nprojects that aim at different levels of position keeping ability, reliability and \n\nredundancy. In general, the types of DP vessel are divided into three classes, \n\naccording to the following criteria (ABS, 2013): \n\n\u2022 Class 1: the loss of position is accepted to occur in a single failure event; \n\u2022 Class 2: loss of position is not accepted to occur in the event of a single failure \n\nof a component or system (generators, thrusters, switchboards, control computers, \n\nsensors, remotely controlled valves, etc.), excluding the loss of one or more \n\ncompartments; \n\n\u2022 Class 3: loss of position is not accepted to occur in the event of a single failure \nof a component or system (generators, thrusters, switchboards, control computer, \n\nsensors, controlled valves remotely, etc.), including the loss of a whole compartment \n\nby fire or flooding. \n\nABS Guide also provides Enhanced Class Notation (EHS) for DP-2 and DP-3 \n\nvessels. This notation provides the basis for the measurement of the enhancement of \n\ncritical components of the DP system, including power and thruster system, control \n\nsystem and fire &amp; flood protection system. Although EHS notation is not available for \n\nDP-1, some shuttle tankers in PETROBRAS fleet are considered to be DP-1 \n\nEnhanced, because they present improvements on their power or thruster system.  \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nThe DP system was developed in the 60s for offshore drilling activities. The first \n\ntrials with shuttle tankers took place in the North Sea in 1982 (Helg\u00f8y, 2003). The DP \n\nshuttle tankers reduce the risk of collision with the production units, since they can \n\ncounteract the environmental loads.  \n\nNevertheless, they are designed with the Bow Loading System (BLS), shown in \n\nFigure 1-10  below, which allows automated connection of the hose string to the \n\nship\u2019s bow manifold and contributes greatly to enhancing personal safety, since it \n\neliminates the direct contact of workers with the hose string. A quick release feature \n\nis also available in the BLS, avoiding environmental pollution in case of undesired \n\nevents. \n \n\nFigure 1-10: BLS connection in DP Shuttle Tankers \n\n \nS o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  \n\n \n\nBecause of these safety advantages, PETROBRAS has adopted since 2002 the \n\nexclusive use of DPSTs to carry out offloading operations in SMS F(P)SOs. The first \n\nto enter the fleet were Cartola and Ataulfo shuttle tankers. Today the fleet consists of \n\n28 vessels, among which eight are DP Class 1, two are DP Class 1 Enhanced, and \n\nseventeen are DP Class 2. \n\nAlthough there are no official records of all incidents and accidents involving \n\nconventional tankers and shuttle tankers for comparison, operational experience \n\nshows that DPST incidents and accidents are less frequent. From 2002 to date there \n\nhas been only one collision recorded in Brazil of Cartola DP-1 shuttle tanker with \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nFPSO Marlim Sul in 2012, while at least three collisions between FPSO and \n\nconventional tankers took place in the history of offloading operations in Brazil. \n\n1.4 Offloading with DP shuttle tankers \n\nThe offloading operation consists of five steps: Approach, Connection/Mooring, \n\nOffloading, Disconnection/Unmooring and Departure. \n\nThe shuttle tanker navigates until the location with its main propeller and rudder. \n\nThe Captain turns the DP system on when the ST is about 1,500m away from the \n\nFPSO. The approximation is aided by the DP system, which actuates on the \n\nthrusters to progressively decrease the shuttle\u2019s speed from around 3 knots to the \n\ncomplete stop. The tanker always approaches in the opposite direction of the \n\nresulting environmental forces to minimize risk of collision in case of blackout.  \n\nWhen the tanker is about 80m away, the messenger line is passed from the \n\nplatform to the tanker with the help of an air pistol. The ST reaps the messenger line \n\nof the hawser and hose string and performs the mooring/connection to both the chain \n\nstopper and the BLS, respectively. The whole connection phase lasts around 6 hours \n\nin total.  \n\nAfter connection, the ST positions itself from 120 to 155m away from the FPSO \n\nto continue the operation. First, a leak test takes place on the hose string and then \n\nwater is pumped from the FPSO to the ST\u2019s slop tank. Finally, the oil starts pumping \n\nfrom the FPSO to the ST\u2019s cargo tanks. \n\nAfter the loading is complete, about 24 hours later, the ship's slop water is \n\npumped back to the FPSO to flush the oil off the hose string, and the ship's crew \n\nstarts to disconnect the hoses and the hawser. Once disconnected, the ship departs \n\nusing the main engine only. \n\nIn order to increase the safety of these operations, PETROBRAS has established \n\nprocedures that limit the operating sector of DPSTs, bordering a green area where \n\nthe vessel is allowed to be positioned in during all stages of offloading. \n\nFigure 1-11 shows the current operating sector for offloading operations in \n\nSpread Moored FPSOs. It can be noted that the limit angles are not symmetrical: the \n\ngreen limit is 45\u00b0 to portside and 60\u00b0 to starboard, or simply -45\u00b0/+60\u00b0. The sector is \n\nmore restricted at portside because this is the riser balcony side, where all the risers \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nare connected. At this side, the risers come out of the water and are exposed to the \n\nsurface. Any collision on there would be catastrophic.  \n\nThe operating sectors are defined as follows: \n\n\u2022 GREEN SECTOR: the sector within which the shuttle tanker is allowed to \nstay during the whole offloading operation. \n\n\u2022 YELLOW SECTOR: the sector within which the ship is allowed to stay as \nlong as necessary for the Captain to try to put the ship back into the Green \n\nZone using the available resources. If the ST reaches 85\u00b0 to starboard or \n\n60\u00b0 to port, the Captain contacts the FPSO OIM, requesting the immediate \n\ninterruption of the offloading operation (OESD I). The shuttle crew must \n\nstay alert to perform emergency disconnection of the hose and mooring \n\nsystem (OESD II - Offloading Emergency ShutDown level 2) if necessary. \n\n\u2022 RED SECTOR: the sector within which the shuttle tanker is not allowed to \nstay under any circumstances. If the ship reaches 90\u00b0 to starboard or 70\u00b0 \n\nto port, the Captain should immediately execute the emergency \n\ndisconnection of the hose line and mooring system (OESD II). \n\n \nFigure 1-11: Operating sector for Spread Moored Platforms \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 0 9 )  \n\n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n1.5 Objectives \n\nThe objective of this work is to develop and apply a meticulous but sufficient \n\nmethodology to validate a modification of a specification in offloading operations. \n\nThe modification under consideration is the proposal of extending the offloading \n\ngreen sector described in section 1.4 from -45\u00b0/+60\u00b0 to -45\u00b0/+90\u00b0. The main \n\nmotivation for this is that extending the green sector may increase the operation\u2019s \n\navailability, or uptime, which may represent financial economy for the platform\u2019s \n\noperator, as it will be explained in section 1.6. \n\nThe extension of the offloading sector was originally proposed by Corr\u00eaa (2012), \n\nwho demonstrated through a series of static analyses that this would result in \n\nsignificant availability gains in offloading operations. Corr\u00eaa studied two proposals of \n\nextended green sectors: -45\u00b0/+90\u00b0 and -45\u00b0/+120\u00b0 \u2013 always maintaining -45\u00b0 at \n\nportside not to increase safety risks on the riser balcony side. His results show that \n\nuptime gain would be significant in both proposals: around 10% and 15%, \n\nrespectively. However, he preferred not to consider -45\u00b0/+120\u00b0 as a feasible proposal \n\nbecause the equipment installed at the FPSO offloading stations (hawser chain \n\nstopper and hoses\u2019 reel) have physical limitations that may be surpassed if the DPST \n\nis allowed to reach +120\u00b0. Figure 1-12 is extracted from his study and shows his final \n\ngreen sector proposal, -45\u00b0/+90\u00b0, which will be evaluated in this study. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nFigure 1-12: Extended operating sector proposed by Corr\u00eaa (2012) \n\n \nS o u rc e : (C o rr\u00ea a , 2 0 1 2 )  \n\n \n\nThis proposal, however, still needed to be evaluated through a specific \n\npreliminary risk analysis, real time simulations and field tests, and the availability \n\ncalculations still needed to be improved to consider an operating window of 36 hours, \n\nwhich is necessary to accomplish the offloading operation.  \n\n That is why the present work developed and applied the methodology further \n\nexplained in section 1.7, in order to validate Corr\u00eaa\u2019s operating sector proposal.  \n\n1.6 Justification \n\nAlthough PETROBRAS has operated with this sector for many years, Santos \n\nBasin offloading operations, which are becoming more and more frequent, are very \n\nchallenging.  \n\nAs it will be shown in section 5.1.2, Santos Basin\u2019s environmental conditions are \n\nmore severe than Campos Basin\u2019s and their mean resultant load tends to push the \n\nshuttle tanker to the West, especially when strong currents come from the East. \n\nFigure 1-13 below shows the difference between annual mean environmental loads \n\nin Campos and Santos Basins. The resultant forces were calculated from hindcast \n\ndata available for each basin (for more information on hindcast data, see sections 2.5 \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nand 5.1.2). It can be seen that mean environmental loads in Campos Basin tend to \n\npush the shuttle tanker to South-West, while in Santos Basins they tend to push the \n\nDPST to the West, i.e., pushing it out of the green sector1.  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1-13: Campos and Santos Basins mean resultant environmental loads \n\n \nS o u rc e : E d u a rd o  A o u n  T a n n u ri  \n\n \n\n                                            \n1 It is important to notice that the FPSO heading on the location is chosen to optimize its mooring \nsystem, i.e., to position the vessel in the most favorable heading to handle the incidence of extreme \nconditions. In Campos and Santos Basins, extreme conditions generally come from South-West, so \nthe FPSOs are headed in a way that unfortunately does not optimize offloading operations. \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nConsequently, on the last years PETROBRAS has experienced several \n\noffloadings being aborted because the DPST could not keep position inside the \n\ngreen sector.  \n\nExtending the operating sector is thus crucial to the efficiency of offloading \n\noperations on the years to come.  Corr\u00eaa (2012) was already aware of this issue and \n\nshowed that increasing the operational sector to -45\u00b0/+90\u00b0 could bring gains of \n\naround 10% to 15% in the availability of each offloading station. This would be \n\nequivalent to 36 days more to operate in a year. \n\nThe greater the availability of operations, the lower the risk of interrupting the oil \n\nproduction due to \"top\". A top happens when the platform has to stop the production \n\nplant due to lack of storage space in the cargo tanks. This scenario may occur when \n\nthe offloading cannot be carried out because of bad weather conditions \u2013 that hinder \n\nthe position keeping of the DPST \u2013 or because of operational difficulties \u2013 DPS \n\ndegradation or problems with the offloading station equipment. \n\nStopping a plant that processes about 100,000 barrels of oil per day generates \n\nmillionaire losses to the operator and should be avoided to the maximum. \n\nEven if there is no risk of top in a platform, the delay in offloading operations \n\ngenerates extra costs of demurrage of the shuttle tanker. The daily rate of these DP \n\ntankers is about U$55,000. For this reason, any demurrage in the operation is quite \n\ncostly to the oil company. \n\nCorr\u00eaa (2012) presents the statistics of emergency disconnections that occurred \n\nin offloading operations in Spread Moored terminals, in both in Santos and Campos \n\nbasins between 2008 and 2011. In total, 33 disconnections took place, of which 13 \n\n(about 40%) were motivated by position keeping difficulties by the DPST \u2013 which can \n\nbe either due to vessel degradation or due to environmental conditions pushing the \n\nship out of the operating sector. The other disconnections have been caused by \n\nother factors, as shown in Figure 1-14. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nFigure 1-14: DPST/SMS FPSO emercency disconnection causes for Campos and Santos \nBasins  \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( C o rr\u00ea a , 2 0 1 2 ) \n\n \n\nAccording to PETROBRAS Business Plan (PETROBRAS, 2015a), by 2020, 22 \n\nmore FPSO units will be installed in Santos Basin to develop the pre-salt fields. In \n\nthis scenario, the increased availability of the offloading operation can bring \n\neconomic benefits to the company, reducing the risk of interrupting the production \n\nunits and of demurrage of shuttle tankers. \n\nNevertheless, Corr\u00eaa (2012) points out that the extension of operating sector \n\ncould increase operational safety, because it allows the ST to better align with \n\nenvironmental conditions, reducing the power demand on the thrusters and hence \n\nthe risk of black-out. This work will show in section 6 that this hypothesis is actually \n\ntrue. \n\n1.7 Methodology \n\nThe methodology used in this study consists in five different steps. First, a \n\nPreliminary Risk Analysis is performed by a group of specialists to assess the \n\npotential hazards associated with the operation on the new extended sector. The \n\nmain purpose is to better understand what can go wrong during the operation at big \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nrelative headings and what the consequences are. Drive-off and blackout failures \n\nfollowed by collision with the F(P)SO are the main focus of this work. This step is \n\ndescribed in section 4. \n\nSecond, a downtime analysis is carried out to evaluate the advantages of the \n\nextended sector in terms of availability gain. This is accomplished by performing \n\nseveral static analyses to determine the ship\u2019s station keeping capability under the \n\nenvironmental conditions from Campos and Santos basins as further explained in \n\nsection 5. This analysis differs from Corr\u00eaa\u2019s because it takes into account an \n\noperating window of 36 hours, which is a more conservative approach, and it uses \n\ndifferent hindcast data from other locations.  \n\nThe third step is a power demand analysis, whose main objective is to evaluate \n\nthe advantages of the extended sector in terms of power demand reduction. As \n\npreviously mentioned in section 1.6, by operating in the extended sector, the shuttle \n\ntanker can better align with environmental conditions which would decrease the \n\npower demand on the thrusters and hence the fuel consumption and the risk of \n\nblackout. This analysis results in a comparison between the optimized power \n\ndemand on the DP system when the vessel operates in original and extended \n\nsectors through histograms, which are shown in section 6. \n\nThe fourth step, detailed in section 7, consists in a series of real time simulations \n\nfollowed by experienced DPST Captains so they can evaluate in practice the \n\nextended operating sector and manifest their opinion about the safety of the \n\noperations under the new proposed conditions. \n\nFinally, the fifth step, detailed in section 8, consists in performing field tests to \n\nevaluate the software update that needs to be installed on the shuttle tanker and to \n\nassess the Captain\u2019s impression on the safety of the operation, this time in real life. \n\n1.8 Text Organization \n\nThis report first provides in section 2 a literature review to show what has been \n\nstudied about offloading operations that is important to the methodology explained in \n\nsection 1.7. This involves operating sectors, risk analysis, numerical simulations, \n\ndowntime analysis and the use of hindcast data. \n\n Then, in section 3, the theoretical concepts, which were used to accomplish the \n\nwhole methodology, are detailed. Those concern the methodologies for calculating \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nenvironmental loads (from wind, waves and current) over the shuttle tanker\u2019s hull, for \n\nthrust allocation \u2013 both used in the Downtime Analysis step \u2013 and the theory behind \n\nPreliminary Risk Assessment, which is used in the fourth step. \n\nNext, it presents in detail each of the methodology\u2019s steps that were performed, \n\nas follows: Preliminary Risk Analysis (PRA) in section 4, Offloading Downtime \n\nAnalysis in section 5, DP System Power Demand Analysis in section 6, Real Time \n\nSimulations in section 7 and Field Tests in section 8. For each activity, the specific \n\nmethodology and results are described. \n\nSection 9 finally brings the conclusions that summarize the results that support \n\nthe proposal of extending the operating sector, and after that, the bibliography, the \n\nglossary, the appendices and annexes are presented. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 38 \n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW AND BACKGROUND \n\nOffloading systems and operations are widely studied in the industrial and \n\nacademic community. Issues such as risk, collision, structural damage are the most \n\nfrequent, as seen below. \n\nIt should be noted that in the North Sea \u2013 a very well studied location in the \n\nliterature \u2013 most FPSOs are single point-moored and align with the environmental \n\nconditions all the time (some even have stern thrusters to change their heading). In \n\naddition, the DPSTs operate at distances between 80 and 100 meters from the \n\nFPSO, and, in general, the DP system is operated in Taut Hawser mode \u2013 when \n\ndistance from FPSO is \u201cmanually\u201d ensured by the Captain, using the main propeller \n\nwith a small thrust astern and keeping the hawser tension up to 20 ton \u2013, as reported \n\nby Chen and Moan (2004) and Vinnem, Utne and Schj\u00f8lberg (2015).  \n\nIn Brazil, on the other hand, most FPSOs are Spread Moored, the operating \n\ndistance of the DPST is 150m and the DP operating mode is called Normal Mode \u2013  \n\nin which the DPS operates automatically with a fixed set point, which is the shuttle\u2019s \n\nmidship section, and in weathervane mode, i.e., the shuttle aligns automatically with \n\nthe resultant of environmental conditions and the midship section is a fixed reference \n\npoint that is kept at the same GPS coordinates all the time.  \n\nTherefore, it is interesting to analyze the aforementioned bibliographies with \n\nsome caution when interpreting their issues and recommendations. \n\n2.1 Offloading operating sectors \n\nThe first reference that mentions operating sectors is the UKOOA Tandem \n\nLoading Guidelines (UKOOA, 2002), which brings the operating limits shown in \n\nFigure 2-1. These limits are less severe than PETROBRAS\u2019 when it comes to \n\ndistance from the FPSO, as they allow the shuttle to be as close as 60 m from the \n\nplatform during operation. On the other hand, it is more restrictive when it comes to \n\nthe position of the shuttle\u2019s bow, which is limited to +/- 25\u00b0.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nFigure 2-1: Offloading operating limits \n\n \nS o u rc e : (U K O O A , 2 0 0 2 )  \n\n \n\nDiederichsen and Olsen (2012) present the qualification of a new DP offloading \n\nvessel, designed to dock onto conventional tankers and keep them on safe position \n\nduring the offloading operation. This vessel is designed to operate in a called banana \n\nsector, which goes from -60\u00b0 on portside and +75\u00b0 on starboard (see Figure 2-2) 300 \n\nmeters away from the spread moored FPSO. This proposal was validated and \n\nconsidered safe enough with the aid of real time simulations. In this case, the green \n\nsector is larger than PETROBRAS\u2019, but the same logic applies here: since the DP \n\nvessel is 300m away from the FPSO, it seems fair to operate in a bigger sector. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n156 \n\n156 \n\ndo setor verde s\u00e3o poss\u00edveis e at\u00e9 mesmo recomendadas, uma vez que permitem a \n\nminimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da pot\u00eancia demandada para a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da posi\u00e7\u00e3o.

At a certain point, its shows an image of a numerical simulation taking into \n\naccount an operating sector, but never gives the parameters of this sector. However, \n\nby analyzing Figure 2-3 and the grid of the drawing it is possible to assume that the \n\ngreen sector is +/- 45\u00b0 and yellow sector is +/- 60\u00b0. \n\n \nFigure 2-3: Operating sector for a SMS FPSO  \n\n \nS o u rc e : (V o o g t a n d  B ru g ts , 2 0 1 0 ) \n\n \n\nChen, Lerstad and Moan (2010), present the following operating sector shown in \n\nFigure 2-4, which is used in Sevan Marine unit (spread moored cylindrical FPSO) \n\noperating in Hummingbird/Chestnut field in the North sea. Although they do not bring \n\n4  OTC 23208 \n\nA typical Field Layout with offloading from a spread moored FPSO is shown in below figure. \nWhen not in use the DP vessel can either be parked onto the FPSO or kept floating away from the FPSO. \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Field Layout with offloading from a spread moored FPSO \n \n\n \nOnce the DP vessel is connected to the tanker, the DP vessel supports the tanker approach and maneuvering operations as \nwell as the station keeping of the tanker during the entire offloading operation (typically 24 hours). The DP vessel\u2019s onboard \ncrew comprises of three people: Two DP operators and one marine engineer. The DP operators have visual contact with all \ncritical areas of the operation at any given time, providing additional safety to the technically fully redundant system. \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4 - Station keeping of tanker by use of the DP Vessel \n \n \n\nDP Vessel\n\nConventional Tanker\n\n8  OTC 20638 \n\nSimulation Results \nSimulations were carried out in different west of Africa environments with waves, wind and current. Different wave \n\nperiods were included to study the sensitivity and dynamic wind and current conditions are included. Particular attention is \npaid to rip currents and squall conditions, in which the current or wind changes rapidly in velocity and or direction under the \ninfluence of throughs moving through the area. \n\nMotions of both vessels, relative motions between the vessels and the resulting hawser or line loads are studied to \ndetermine the uptime. The simulation model also outputs the wind, wave and current forces and the forces applied by the tugs \nand anchor system. The topview plots shown in Figure 10 allow quick assessment of the behavior and comparison with the \nspecified safe offloading sectors. \n\n \nFigure 10 Top view of offloading operation with safe working sectors \n\n \nComparison with model tests  \n\nFor model testing, a 135,000 m3 storage capacity transport vessel is considered whose main particulars are listed in Table \n1. The natural roll period of the loaded vessel at 11.0 m draft is 15.5 seconds. The roll period of the transport vessel is slightly \nlonger than the roll period of the offshore terminal of 14s.The transport vessel is moored alongside the terminal with 20 lines \nand 4 large fenders. Eight spring lines are centered around midship and run from fairleads 30m from midships on the terminal \nto 60m from midship on the transport vessel. The calm water pretension in the lines equals 150kN. The 20 line mooring \narrangement consists of 6 aft breast lines near the stern, 4 aft spring lines, 4 fore spring lines, 6 fore breast lines near the bow \nlines. To reduce the stiffness of the lines, the lines continue towards bollards further on the deck and a 25m nylon tail is \nincluded in each line. The vessels are separated by four pneumatic fenders with an unloaded diameter of 4.5m. The \npretension in the lines loads the fenders with 375kN each, resulting in a compression of 0.5m and a gap distance between the \nships of 4m. The mooring lines and fenders are combined to increase the accuracy of the tests and the equivalent \nconfiguration and setup is shown in Figure 11. \n\n \nTable 1 Main dimensions of the vessels used in the simulations \n\nDesignation offshore terminal transport vessel \nLength between perpendiculars [m] 300 274 \nBreadth [m] 65 44.2 \nDepth [m] 32 25 \nDraft (even keel) [m] 13 11 \n\n \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nthe information about the sector aperture angles, it is possible to see that the \n\ndistance from the FPSO is 250m, that the DPST may assume a wide range of \n\nheadings and that the ship always aims a pivot point which is not the FPSO\u2019s \n\noffloading station \u2013 reducing, thus, the risk of collision in case of drive-off. The blue \n\nzone is the messenger line pick-up point. \n\n \nFigure 2-4: Operating sector for a SMS FPSO  \n\n \nS o u rc e : (C h e n , L e rs ta d  a n d  M o a n , 2 0 1 0 ) \n\n2.2 Offloading risk analysis \n\nRisk analysis is an important activity for managing the health and safety of any \n\nbusiness. They are commonly used to assess the possible hazards of the operations \n\nand decide whether the operator is implementing reasonable measures to prevent \n\nthose hazards from becoming accidents.  \n\nDifferent techniques may be used for assessing and analyzing risks, but they are \n\nusually classified into two categories: qualitative risk analysis and quantitative risk \n\nanalysis. The last alternative is usually applied when the main target is to quantify the \n\nprobabilities of occurrence of a certain hazard and its consequences, when that \n\ninformation is important for decision-making. When it comes to offloading operations, \n\n \n\n \n\n161 \n\n161 \n\nposicionamento do NADP com as caracter\u00edsticas ilustradas na Figura 3-20 e na Figura \n\n3-21 a seguir: \n\n \n\nFigura 3-20 \u2013 Setor operacional e estrat\u00e9gia de posicionamento para NADP propostos por \nLERSTAD [13]. Ilustra\u00e7\u00e3o extra\u00edda de LERSTAD [13]. \n\n \n\nA defini\u00e7\u00e3o deste setor operacional teve como premissa a n\u00e3o utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do cabo \n\nde amarra\u00e7\u00e3o \u2018hawser\u2019, uma vez que havia o direcionador das companhias operadoras \n\nno Mar do Norte de simplifica\u00e7\u00e3o das opera\u00e7\u00f5es. Para ainda se reduzir a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao \n\nrisco de colis\u00e3o direta foi tamb\u00e9m tida como diretriz uma maior dist\u00e2ncia entre a \n\nunidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e a embarca\u00e7\u00e3o de al\u00edvio durante as opera\u00e7\u00f5es. Com o mesmo \n\nobjetivo, a l\u00f3gica inserida \u00e0 estrat\u00e9gia de posicionamento do SPD considera ainda dois \n\npontos de pivotamento para que em nenhum instante o NADP tenha seu eixo \n\nlongitudinal alinhado com o FPSO. Finalmente, desenhou-se ent\u00e3o um setor operacional \n\nem que o NADP poderia aproar-se mesmo de forma paralela \u00e0 unidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o o \n\n\n\n 42 \n\na quantitative risk analysis targets at, for example, calculating the expected \n\nprobability of collisions between shuttle tanker and FPSO as Chen and Moan (2004) \n\ndid. They developed a probabilistic model based on historical statistics of collisions \n\ncaused by drive-off events and on the modelling of probability of failure of recovery \n\nactions to avoid collision after drive-off has initiated. \n\nRodriguez (2012) has performed extensive studies on quantitative risk analysis in \n\noffloading operations introducing a method called dynamic probabilistic analysis, \n\nwhich considers that probabilities of failure may change over time with the come-out \n\nof new events. The method applies Bayesian and Markovian analysis to calculate the \n\nprobabilities of different failure events. Other references on that subject include \n\nRodriguez and Souza (2011a and 2011b). \n\nQualitative analysis, which is used in this study, is the best choice when the \n\nobjective is to evaluate and rank the risks of the operation into \u201ctolerable\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d \n\nand \u201cnot tolerable\u201d categories and to assess recommendations for risk mitigation. \n\nQualitative analysis must be based, as much as possible, on professionals\u2019 \n\nexperience, historical incidents data and technical knowledge of the systems and \n\ntheir failure causes. Many are the authors who discuss those issues. \n\nVinnem, Utne and Schj\u00f8lberg (2015) and Lundborg (2014) present statistics on \n\nthe number of collisions and near collisions that occurred between 1996 and 2013 in \n\nFPSOs operating for Norway and the UK in the North Sea, showing that there were 7 \n\ncollisions and 13 near collisions with DP shuttle tankers in that period. Chen and \n\nMoan (2004) report that among 2,000 offloading operations that were carried out by \n\nDP shuttle tankers between 1996 and 2000, 5 collisions took place, all of them \n\ncaused by drive-off event, which happens when the DP system erroneously drives \n\nthe ship out of position \u2013 backwards or forwards, the last one increasing the risk of \n\ncollision. \n\nAlso according to Chen, the occurrence of drive-off is associated with the intense \n\nresponse of FPSOs to environmental conditions (surge and yaw motions), which \n\nimposes large changes in the horizontal relative distance between the vessels. \n\nThese situations make the DP system of the ST constantly seek the correct distance \n\nfrom the target and possibly end up driving the tanker forward and against the \n\nplatform. This hypothesis is not actually applicable in Brazilian fields, because SMS \n\nFPSOs do not present large fishtailing motions while single point moored FPSOs \n\noperate with conventional shuttle tankers. By PETROBRAS own experience, drive-off \n\n\n\n 43 \n\noccurs mostly for technical or maintenance problems such as locking of the pitch of \n\nthe Controlled Pitch Propeller (CPP) in an unwanted position. \n\nChen also estimated by time domain simulations that the Captain\u2019s response to \n\ndrive-off must take 53 seconds maximum to successfully avoid collision when \n\noperating at 80m-distance, whereas it must take 81 seconds maximum when \n\noperating ate 150m-distance. However, based on information about incidents, \n\nanalysis of questionnaires given to various Captains and observation training \n\nsimulator instructors, on average, an operator takes 60-90 seconds to react. \n\nMacDonald et al. (1999), Chen and Moan (2004) and Vinnem, Utne and \n\nSchj\u00f8lberg (2015) point out that the biggest risks are related to drive-off and may \n\ncause extensive damage as rupture of fuel tanks, damage to living quarters, loss of \n\nmultiple anchoring lines, flooding of the machinery room, and even multiple \n\nexplosions in both vessels if severe collision takes place just below the flare \n\nstructure. \n\nSeveral recommendations are made for mitigating risks, including use of fenders \n\nduring operation (MacDonald et al., 1999), more training and better scaling of the \n\ncrew (Williams et al., 1999) and better integration with the support base onshore \n\n(Easton and Falcon, 2000) - the latter being framed in the reality of drilling rigs, but \n\nnot impossible to adapt to the case of DP vessels. \n\nVinnem, Utne and Schj\u00f8lberg (2015) and Mo, Muddusetti and Cargill (2011) also \n\npropose the implementation of decision support software on the DPST that provides \n\nonline information such as manuals, documents, standards, lists of equipment \n\ninterdependence and failure consequences, assisting the commander in decision-\n\nmaking on the continuation or not of the offloading operation. \n\nFinally, Chen and Moan (2004) propose measures to increase the time to \n\nrespond to the drive-off events: more effective systems to drive-off detection, \n\nimproved training of the crew to ensure greater attention during operations and the \n\nincrease in operating distance between ship and platform. \n\nThis last recommendation makes perfect sense if we compare accident statistics \n\noccurred in the North Sea, where the DPST operates 80 to 100m away from the \n\nFPSO (Vinnem, Utne and Schj\u00f8lberg, 2015), and in Brazil, where PETROBRAS \n\nprocedures require 150m. While Vinnem, Utne and Schj\u00f8lberg (2015) reports at least \n\nseven collisions between 1996 and 2013 in the North Sea, Brazil experienced only \n\none collision event between 2002 and 2016. \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nObviously, this is a very simplified comparison. Several issues may be related to \n\nfewer accidents in Brazil, including shorter history in DP offloading, type of FPSO \n\nmooring system (SPM versus SMS), shorter number of DP-aided offloadings \n\nperformed per year, company\u2019s management system and other issues. However, the \n\noperating distance between vessels is a strong sign. \n\nLiteratures about predicting collision damages between ships were also \n\nresearched in order to have an idea of how critical a collision between FPSO and DP \n\nshuttle tanker would be during offloading. Many authors have developed several \n\ntools and they include simple formulae, simplified analytical methods, simplified FEM, \n\nand non-linear FEM simulations. \n\nMost part of the articles found, though, such as Sun (2015), Kitamura et al. \n\n(2002), Yamada and Pedersen (2007) and Gao et al. (2014), predict collision \n\nconsequences between two ships, or between FPSO and passing ships, taking place \n\nat speeds ranging from 5 to 15 knots. The last authors conclude that right angle \n\ncollision is the worst case for the struck ship. \n\nHowever, MacDonald et al. (1999) claim that collision between FPSO and DP \n\nshuttle tanker during offloading might take place at a maximum of 2 knots, because \n\nsuch a small distance between the vessels would not allow the DPST to accelerate \n\nmore than that in case of a drive-off event. No other study was found about \n\ncalculating collision consequences between FPSO and DPST during offloading, but it \n\nis known that the only collision experienced in PETROBRAS\u2019 history originated \n\nstructural damages only with no oil spills or personnel injury. \n\n2.3 Offloading numerical simulations \n\nNumerical simulations are usually applied in Naval and Marine Engineering in \n\norder to calculate vessels\u2019 motions and accelerations under the influence of weather \n\n(current, wind and waves), other vessels 2  and mooring or Dynamic Positioning \n\nsystem. Three types of simulations are commonly used: static analyses, fast-time \n\ndynamic analyses and real-time dynamic analysis. \n\n                                            \n2 Simultaneous operations with two or more vessels generally require a so-called diffraction and \nradiation analyses, because the presence of other hulls close to a certain vessel may affect the \nprofiles of wave, wind and current that reach it. \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nStatic analyses consider that environmental loads are constant forces acting on \n\nthe hull. Thus, they are simple, fast and do not consume many computational \n\nresources. Although the real environmental conditions are dynamic, i.e., they change \n\nover time, static analyses are widely used in the industry since they allow that a large \n\nnumber of conditions are tested in minimum time. Normally, a safety margin is put \n\ninto place to guarantee that the results are conservative.  \n\nWhen it comes to Dynamic Positioning operations, they are commonly used, for \n\nexample, to evaluate the station-keeping capability of DP vessels. The simulations \n\ncalculate constant environmental loads over the hull in every direction from 0 to 360\u00b0 \n\nand evaluate if the available thrust is able to counteract those forces or not, and, \n\nthus, if the vessel can maintain position and heading or not. The results are usually \n\npresented as Capability Plots, which are polar plots that contain wind envelopes, \n\nwhere the maximum wind speed at which the vessel can maintain position and \n\nheading is plotted for each angle of attack. A plot example is shown in Figure 2-5.  \n\nIMCA (2000) specifies the requirements for generating Capability Plots based on \n\nstatic analyses. In order to compensate for dynamic loads, which, as already said, \n\nare not represented in static analysis, IMCA recommends using a 15-20% dynamic \n\nmargin over the available thrust to guarantee the conservativeness of the results.  \n\n \nFigure 2-5: DP Capability Plot example  \n\n \nS o u rc e : (V IC U S d t, 2 0 1 6 ) \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 46 \n\nSome authors disagree with performing static analysis to determine station-\n\nkeeping capability of DP vessels, which is the case of Smogeli et al. (2013). The \n\nauthors of this study show that performing dynamic analysis and establishing \n\nallowable offset and heading deviations instead might be more conservative and \n\nrealistic than IMCA\u2019s method and generate smaller wind envelopes. However, the \n\ndynamic analysis results depend on several factors, including thrusters\u2019 response \n\ntime and DP system control parameters, which were not detailed in their study. \n\nOn the other hand, Tannuri, Saad and Morishita (2009) verified that the IMCA \n\n20% margin for static analysis is adequate for DP vessels that do not need much \n\noffset precision such as DP shuttle tankers. Other vessels, however, such as drilling \n\nunits and pipe laying vessels, which need more offset and heading precision, should \n\nbe modeled with larger margins in static analysis.  \n\nDynamic analyses, on the other hand, are simulations that take into account the \n\nfact that environmental loads are dynamic and change over time and that \n\nconsequently, vessels\u2019 motions also change with time. They can be performed \n\nthrough either fast-time analysis or real-time analysis. Since both are time domain \n\nsimulations and consider non-linear effects, they are much more complex, time-\n\nconsuming and resources consuming than static analyses.  \n\nFast-time dynamic analysis usually requires a specific software, like Dynasim, \n\nand a computer with good processing capability (or a cluster, depending on how \n\ncomplex the simulation is). The parameters of the simulation are input in the software \n\nand the simulation is run by itself with no further interference from the user. The \n\nresults can be shown as time domain or frequency domain graphics concerning \n\nvessel\u2019s motions and accelerations, environmental loads, thruster forces or mooring \n\nlines\u2019 tensions. An animation of the vessel\u2019s movements is usually generated from \n\nthe simulations as well. When it comes to analyzing DP operations, they are most \n\ncommonly used, for example, when the main goal is to evaluate and test DP system \n\nbehavior or parameters of the PID controller, as done by Peng and Spencer (2008) \n\nand Tannuri and Morishita (2006).  \n\nReal time simulations are the last type of simulations that are commonly used to \n\nanalyze DP operations. These simulations take place in full-mission facilities, with a \n\nrealistic representation of the ship\u2019s bridge \u2013 built with all the available equipment \n\nthat exists in the real ship \u2013 and immerse pilots into very realistic scenarios. These \n\nsimulators use the same algorithms as the fast-time dynamic analysis, but they \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nproject on the screens the animation of the operation as if it as happening in real life \n\nand the users are capable of interacting with the simulation and change parameters \n\nsuch as environmental condition, thruster forces and rudder direction. They can be \n\nused for a variety of applications, including crew training and skills improvement, \n\noperations planning and non-conventional operations evaluation. Currently, most of \n\nthe medium to large size navigation companies, pilots and Captains, are already \n\nfamiliarized with this type of simulators. Some time-domain maneuvering simulators \n\nare presented by Ankudinov, Kaplan and Jacobsen (1993) and Fossen and Smodeli \n\n(2004). Other authors such as Varela and Soares (2015), Sutulo and Soares (2015), \n\nTannuri, Saad and Morishita (2009) and Tannuri et. al (2014) have described \n\nexamples of operation analyses with real time simulations.  \n\nSutulo and Soares (2015) have compared the results from real-time maneuver \n\nsimulations to sea trial full-scale data and have concluded that their simulator\u2019s \n\nnumerical model is adequate to reality. Tannuri, Saad and Morishita (2009) have \n\ncompared full-scale measurements of a DP offloading operation \u2013 that included \n\nvessel\u2019s motions, individual thrusters\u2019 forces, DPST and FPSO distances and \n\nenvironmental conditions \u2013 to the offloading simulation in the same conditions. The \n\nresults also show good agreement between numerical simulations and full-scale \n\nmeasurements indicating that the computational simulator is an effective tool in the \n\nanalysis and design of DP systems. \n\nTannuri et al. (2014) describe the mathematical models of the simulator used in \n\nthis project and presents two examples of application. A better overview of this \n\nsimulator is presented in section 7.1. \n\n2.4 Offloading downtime analysis \n\nMany literatures discuss improvements in the availability of offloading operations, \n\nas they are directly related to the cost of production loss due to possibility of \n\ninterrupting the FPSO production. \n\nMisund and Tveitt (1982) proposed as downtime calculation method the \n\nobservation of several production units over time, counting how many oil transfer \n\nfailures occurred and how long it took until the problem was resolved. Because the \n\nproposed method was difficult to put into practice, as the authors said themselves, \n\nthey adhered only to cite best practices for increasing the availability of the operation, \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nsuch as providing redundancy in systems or major equipment and performing \n\nperiodic maintenance campaigns in key components as a hawser, hoses and oil \n\nswivel. \n\nYamamoto et al. (2002) studied a new technology to control the dynamic \n\npositioning system based on neural networks and shows that with this system, which \n\nis installed on the FPSO to control yaw motions, the tension in the hawser may be \n\nwell controlled even under adverse conditions. Thus, the Hs limit for offloading \n\noperation can be increased from 3.5m to 4.5m, increasing thus the availability of \n\noperation. \n\nBallard and Evans (2014) discuss the planning of offshore operations, such as \n\ninstallation of subsea equipment, based on the concept of availability. The \n\nimportance of his work to the present one is that he proposes using environmental \n\nconditions measures or computer modeling, like hindcast data, to predict the \n\nprobability of success of each sub-task depending on its duration. This was similarly \n\ndone in the present study and better described in section 5. \n\nTannuri et al. (2010a) present a methodology for calculating downtime of \n\noffloading operations through performance of dynamic analysis. Tannuri et al. \n\n(2010b) make a comparative analysis of calculating downtime through static and \n\ndynamic analysis and conclude that the first method is more conservative than the \n\nsecond one when using a 20% margin for dynamic allowance (this margin is used to \n\ncompensate the dynamic loads that are neglected in static analysis as mentioned in \n\nsection 2.3). \n\nFinally, Corr\u00eaa et al. (2013) use the static analysis methodology for calculating \n\nthe downtime of offloading operations, and the present work is based on the same \n\napproach proposed by them but with a more conservative approach, which is taking \n\ninto account an operating window of 36h as it will be explained in section 5.2. \n\n2.5 Environmental hindcast data \n\nThe downtime calculation was performed based on hindcast data from Campos \n\nand Santos basins. Hindcast data consist in a database of wave and swell significant \n\nheights and periods, wind and current speeds, all of them associated with their \n\nincidence direction. These data are generated using numerical models that provide \n\naccurate, localized long-term data of ocean and atmospheric conditions. \n\n\n\n 49 \n\nSeveral literatures such as Akpinar and K\u00f6m\u00fcrc\u00fc (2013), Boudi\u00e8re et al. (2013), \n\nChawla, Spindler and Tolman (2013), Durrant, Greenslade and Simmonds (2009) \n\nand Suursaar, Kullas and APS (2012) discuss the use, accuracy and validation of \n\nhindcast data. In general hindcast data are very reliable, have been validated through \n\ncomparison with satellite altimeters and in-situ buoy measurements and have been \n\nused for different purposes, such as offshore structures design, marine energy \n\nconverters, wave farms design and even for marine biology studies.   \n\nThe wave and wind data for this study come from the results of BOMOSHU JIP \n\n(Oceanweather, 2016) and current data come from the HYCOM consortium \n\n(HYCOM, 2016). All data were also validated through comparison with satellite \n\nmeasures and oceanic buoys. The data comprehend the period of 1st of January \n\n2004 and 31st of December 2009 because HYCOM data were available from 2004 on \n\nand the JIP finished in 2009. More recent data were not available, however they are \n\nnot expected to have changed over the years. PETROBRAS oceanography \n\nspecialists affirm that recent buoy measurements do not show increase in wind, wave \n\nand current intensities over the last years. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 50 \n\n3 THEORETICAL CONCEPTS \n\nThis section presents the theoretical concepts that were used as a basis for the \n\nsimulations or calculations performed in this study. \n\n3.1 Static environmental loads over the hull  \n\nThe Offloading Downtime Analysis further discussed in section 5 is accomplished \n\nby means of static analyses and uses a database of discrete environmental \n\nconditions called hindcast data (se sections 2.5 and 5.1.2).  Static analysis is chosen \n\nover dynamic analysis because it is more time saving in terms of computational \n\nresources. \n\nStatic analysis only considers average loads over the hull and despises important \n\neffects such as wind gusts, first order movements and slow drift forces. Hence, they \n\nare faster than dynamic analysis. To compensate for these simplifications, a 20% \n\nmargin is applied over the thrusters\u2019 maximum capability as a reserve for dynamic \n\neffects. This margin is usually known as \u201cdynamic allowance\u201d (IMCA, 2000). \n\nIn order to perform static analyses, the first step is to calculate environmental \n\nloads over the hull of the DPST. Environmental loads comprehend current, wind and \n\nwave forces, and their calculation is described in the following sections. \n\nThe mathematical models are the same used by Tannuri, Saad and Morishita \n\n(2009) and Corr\u00eaa (2012). Current and wind moments and loads are considered \n\nconstant and are described by generic equations that require drag coefficients. Wave \n\nloads and moments are also constant but are calculated based on the location\u2019s \n\nwave spectrum. \n\nAs the hindcast data is a discrete database, the formulation presented on the \n\nfollowing sections must be applied to each of the 17,536 environmental conditions of \n\nthe database to calculate the resultant environmental loads and, further on, the \n\nstation keeping ability of the DPST. \n\nShips\u2019 dynamics is classically decomposed into six degrees of freedom, as \n\nshown in Figure 3-1. Translational movements represented by ?1, ?2 and ?3 are \n\ncalled, respectively, surge, sway and heave. Rotational movements represented by \n\n?4, ?5 and ?6 are called, respectively, roll, pitch and yaw. \n\n \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nFigure 3-1: Ship\u2019s dynamics in six degrees of freedom \n\n \nS o u rc e : (C o rr\u00ea a , 2 0 1 2 )  \n\n \n\nAs the Dynamic Positioning System is only capable of acting on the horizontal \n\nplane movements (surge, sway and yaw), only these three degrees of freedom are \n\nmodeled in the static analyses.  \n\n3.1.1 Current moments and loads  \n\nCurrent moments and loads are calculated according to OCIMF guidelines \n\n\u201cPredictions of wind and current loads on VLCCs\u201d (OCIMF, 1994).

The DP system is not capable of reacting to these forces, because the \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nthrusters\u2019 response time is too slow for that. Moreover, these forces do not interfere \n\nin the average position of the vessel in a long time observation, so they are not \n\nconsidered in static analysis. \n\nSlow and mean drift loads are second order loads, i.e., proportional to the square \n\nof the wave heights. These are the loads, which the DP system is able to \n\ncompensate, because of their lower frequency. Slow drift loads are dynamic, so they \n\nare also not considered in static analysis. \n\nMean drift loads are constant and impose large thrust demand in the DP system \n\nto compensate it. Thus, they are the only wave loads considered for static analysis \n\nand their calculation is shown further in this section. \n\nIn order to calculate mean drift forces, it is important to model the location sea \n\nstate in which the DP vessel is operating through a sea spectrum. The sea spectrum \n\nrepresents the way irregular waves\u2019 energies are distributed in relation to their \n\nfrequency. Following PETROBRAS procedures, bi-modal JONSWAP modeling is \n\nused here, whose calculation is given by Equation 3.7. \n\n \n\n! ! =\n!!!!\n!! .!\"# ?\n\n5\n4\n!!\n!\n\n!\n!!\"# ! !!!! !/(!!!!!!)

(3.10)  \n \n\nHowever, this system of equations presents 3 equations and !!\"#! + !!\"#$ \nunknown values, so the solution for this system has to be found through minimization \n\nalgorithms. The minimization consists in finding the combination of thruster forces \n\nthat require minimum total power demand from the DP system. \n\nIt is well known that the power demand on the DP system is proportional to the \n\nsum of the modulus of thrust forces to the power of 3/2 (Tannuri, 2002, Rindar\u00f8y, \n\n2013, and Fossen, 2002). However, the power demand can be approximated by the \n\nsum of thrust forces to the power of 2 in order to use simpler minimization algorithms \n\nwithout implying significant errors to the result (De Wit, 2009). The function to be \n\nminimized, !(!), thus, is assumed to be proportional to the sum of squares of \nthruster forces following equation (3.11) below. \n\n \n\n! ! !~ !!!\n!!\"#!\n\n!!!\n (3.11)  \n\n \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nIn this study, the minimization of the power demand function is accomplished in \n\nMatlab through \u201cFmincon\u201d function, which finds the minimum of a problem specified \n\nby the function to be minimized and the problem\u2019s restraints given by the user. \n\nIn the thrust allocation problem of the present work, the only restraint is to \n\nconsider that the maximum load in each thruster must be less than 80% of maximum \n\navailable thrust. This is done to better distribute the thrust demand among all the \n\nthrusters and to avoid that the minimization algorithm calculates, for example, 100% \n\npower of one thruster and 10% of the others. \n\nThe present problem does not consider any forbidden zones or efficiency loss \n\ndue to hull structures or thrusters interferences, but that is a fair simplification since \n\nthose effects are less expected in a shuttle tanker when compared to a semi-\n\nsubmersible rig. \n\n3.3 Preliminary risk analysis \n\nAs part of managing the health and safety of any business, it is important to \n\ncontrol the risks involved in every operation or activity. Risk analysis techniques are \n\ncommonly used to assess the possible hazards of the operations and decide whether \n\nthe company is implementing reasonable measures to prevent those hazards from \n\nbecoming accidents.  \n\nRisk analysis can be either qualitative or quantitative. The last alternative is \n\nusually applied when the main target is to quantify the probabilities of occurrence of a \n\ncertain hazard and its consequences, when that information is important for decision-\n\nmaking. For example, if a company wants to evaluate a certain operation and \n\ndetermine the probability of failure and the costs involved in the event of failure, \n\nquantitative analysis is the best choice. However, this technique is usually complex, \n\ntime costing and might demand the use of specific software. \n\nQualitative analysis, which is used in this study, is the best choice when the \n\nobjective is to determine the severity and importance of the risks of the operation, to \n\nrank them and to assess recommendations for risk mitigation. \n\nThis alternative is widely used in the oil &amp; gas industry when it comes to planning \n\noperations and activities from the simplest ones, such as welding and painting, to the \n\nmost complex ones such as FPSO or subsea equipment installation. Qualitative risk \n\nanalysis is so important in this sector that the International Maritime Organization \n\n\n\n 60 \n\n(IMO, 2002) proposes its own methodology called Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) \n\nfor that. \n\nFSA is a structured and systematic methodology for qualitative risk analysis \n\nwhose main goal is to help in the evaluation of new regulations for maritime safety \n\nand protection of the marine environment, but it can also be used as a tool for routine \n\noperation risk analysis. The methodology consists in accomplishing the following five \n\nsteps: \n\n \n\n1. Identification of hazards: identify a list of hazards, their frequency, their \nseverity and ranking of the risks with the help of a tolerability matrix; \n\n2. Risk analysis: detailed investigation of the causes and consequences of the \nmore important scenarios identified in step 1; \n\n3. Risk control options (RCOs): propose effective and practical \nrecommendations for risk mitigation; \n\n4. Cost benefit assessment: identify and compare benefits and costs \nassociated with the implementation of each recommendation identified and \n\ndefined in step 3; and \n\n5. Recommendations for decision-making: define the RCOs, which should be \npresented to the relevant decision makers. \n\n \n\nIt is important to highlight at this point the following terminology defined by IMO \n\nthat will also be used in this study: \n\n \n\n\u2022 \u201cHazard\u201d is a potential to threaten human life, health, property or the \n\nenvironment; \n\n\u2022 \u201cAccident\u201d is an unintended event involving fatality, injury, ship loss or \n\ndamage, other property loss or damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cInitiating event\u201d is the first of a sequence of events leading to a hazardous \n\nsituation or accident. Here, it will be referred to as the \u201ccause\u201d of an \n\naccident. \n\n\u2022 \u201cAccident scenario\u201d is a sequence of events from the initiating event to \n\none of the final stages, which can be interpreted as the specific \n\ncombination of a certain hazard, the events that trigger the accident (i.e., \n\nthe causes), and their corresponding consequences. If an accident may \n\n\n\n 61 \n\npresent different causes, each of them might generate a different accident \n\nscenario; \n\n\u2022 \u201cConsequence\u201d is the outcome of an accident; \n\n\u2022 \u201cFrequency\u201d is the number of occurrences per unit time (e.g., per year), \n\nbut in this study it represents the qualitative probability of occurrence of an \n\naccident scenario (for example, \u201cfrequent\u201d, \u201clikely\u201d, \u201cnot likely\u201d, \u201cremote\u201d); \n\n\u2022 \u201cRisk\u201d is the combination of the frequency and the severity of the \n\nconsequence. \n\n \n\nAnother common technique for qualitative risk analysis is called Preliminary Risk \n\nAnalysis, or simply PRA. This technique is close to FSA\u2019s methodology, except that \n\nsteps 1 and 2 do not follow this exact order and steps 4 and 5 are not necessarily \n\naccomplished. PETROBRAS has established an internal regulation for performing \n\nPRA and other qualitative techniques, which is N-2782 \u2013 Applicable Techniques for \n\nIndustrial Risk Analysis (PETROBRAS, 2015b) \u2013 that can be found in ANNEX A.  \n\nFigure 3-7 below is extracted from N-2782 and shows the PRA methodology \n\nflowchart. The frequency, severity and risk evaluation follows the Risk Tolerability \n\nMatrix shown in Figure 3-8. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-7: PRA flowchart \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 b ) \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nFigure 3-8: Risk Tolerability Matrix, N-2782  \n \n\nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 b ) \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 64 \n\n \n\nA group of specialists on the subject accomplishes this methodology in a \n\nbrainstorm session.

The \n\naccident scenario is defined as the ensemble formed by phase, hazard, its \n\ncauses and its consequences. \n\n \n\nThe PRA methodology is the most used in PETROBRAS, and offloading \n\noperations are commonly evaluated through this technique. When the operations \n\ntake place in normal conditions, i.e., following offloading guidelines, they are already \n\ncovered by a generalist analysis that is applicable to all the FPSOs and DPSTs in \n\nBrazil.  \n\n\n\n 66 \n\nHowever, if one parameter is changed \u2013 like the operating sector angles, a \n\nsimultaneous operation with a rig, harsh environments, DPST degradation and others \n\n\u2013 a specific risk analysis must be carried out. That is why the Preliminary Risk \n\nAnalysis is important to be done in order to validate the new operating sector. The \n\nresults of this analysis are described in section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 67 \n\n4 PRELIMINARY RISK ANALYSIS \n\nPreliminary risk assessment was the first task to be done in this study because it \n\nwas important to analyze the expansion of the operating sector among other \n\nPETROBRAS specialists before investing in other time and cost consuming activities.  \n\nAs explained in section 3.3, offloading operations in normal conditions are \n\nalready covered by a generalist risk analysis that is applicable to all the FPSOs and \n\nDPSTs in Brazil. However, when one parameter is changed \u2013 like the operating \n\nsector angles in this case \u2013 a specific risk analysis must be carried out. \n\nCorr\u00eaa (2012) presents Preliminary Risk Analyses for offloading operations \n\ncomparing the use of conventional and DP shuttle tankers. The conclusion is that \n\nconventional STs present a greater number of non-tolerable risks than DPSTs. \n\nHowever, his study is focused in normal offloading operations and does not discuss \n\nthe additional risks associated with operating in the extended sector. Hence, the \n\nmain goal of the PRA presented in this section is to analyze these additional risks.  \n\nThe following sections explain the methodology used, the participating team, the \n\npremises taken and finally the results, which were summarized from the technical \n\nreport that was issued at the time (DNV, 2014).  \n\n4.1 Methodology \n\nAs mentioned in section 3.3, the Preliminary Risk Analysis followed \n\nrecommendations of PETROBRAS norm N-2782, Applicable Techniques for \n\nIndustrial Risk Analysis. \n\nThe first step was to identify the different phases of the offloading operations \u2013 \n\napproach, connection, offloading, disconnection and departure \u2013 and to assess all \n\nthe operating procedures for them. Then, for each phase, the group of specialists \n\nassessed a list of hazards, and, for each hazard, its causes, safeguards, existing \n\nmeans of detection and the possible consequences. The consequences\u2019 severity \n\nwere classified following the most serious effect that an accident scenario presents, \n\ne.g., if a collision implied light injuries to people (category II following the risk matrix) \n\nand catastrophic oil spill (category V), the scenario severity was classified in category \n\nV \u2013 catastrophic.  \n\n\n\n 68 \n\nThe ensemble formed by phase, hazard, its causes and its consequences \n\nconstitutes an accident scenario. Thus, the same hazard, e.g. DPST drive-off, can \n\nunfold in more than one accident scenario, e.g., collision caused by drive-off, collision \n\ncaused by blackout, collision caused by human error. For each accident scenario, the \n\nfrequency of occurrence and severity of its consequences were evaluated \n\nqualitatively, and   the risk was classified as Risk tolerability matrix established by N-\n\n2782 standard is shown in Figure 3-8.  \n\nFor each scenario, whose risk was classified as \u201cModerate\u201d or \u201cNot Tolerable\u201d \n\nrecommendations for risk reduction were proposed and the residual risk was \n\nevaluated considering the implementation of these recommendations. \n\nThe Preliminary Risk Analysis (PRA) was conducted through meetings with staff \n\nfrom PETROBRAS E&amp;P division, TRANSPETRO and DNV GL, using a standard \n\nspreadsheet (shown in Figure 3-9) where the analysis of the hazards of the activities \n\nand tasks of each phase of DP offloading operation in the extended sector were \n\nfilled. \n\nIn the case of the offloading operation, the main hazards refer to events such as \n\ncollision, incidents during cable or hose handling, oil leaks, man lost at sea, etc. In \n\nthis analysis, though, only collision scenarios were analyzed because it was \n\nconsidered that other types of risk are independent of the operational sector and \n\nwere therefore already analyzed in other risk analyzes. \n\nOne last observation is important to highlight at this point. Considering the formal \n\ndefinition of \u201chazard\u201d (see section 3.3), in the offloading scenario, a hazard would be, \n\nfor example, the great proximity between DPST and FPSO. The concretion of this \n\nhazard, i.e., the accident, would be the collision of the two vessels caused by human \n\nerror and its consequences would be oil leak from cargo tank. However, to facilitate \n\nthe analysis and the filling of the spreadsheet, the definitions of \u201chazard\u201d and \n\n\u201caccident\u201d are mixed together and the hazard in this example scenario becomes the \n\ncollision itself, the cause is human error and the consequence is oil leak. \n\n4.2 Team \n\nThe Preliminary Risk Analysis was performed by a group of offloading \n\nspecialists: two DPST Captains, four naval engineers, two risk analysis consultants \n\n\n\n 69 \n\nand a professor from University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), which gathered for two days in \n\nPETROBRAS office in Rio de Janeiro. \n\n4.3 Premises \n\nThe main premises regarding the risk analysis study are listed below: \n\n\u2022 Location: Non-defined basin \u2013 the group agreed that environmental \n\nconditions would not interfere on the frequency and consequences of the \n\nhazards, since the DPST only operates within contractual limits; the \n\nresults are valid both for Campos and Santos basins; \n\n\u2022 Contractual environmental limits \u2013 follow PETROBRAS offloading \n\nprocedures (PETROBRAS, 2009); \n\n\u2022 Conditions for mooring, unmooring and operating follow PETROBRAS \n\noffloading procedures (PETROBRAS, 2009); \n\n\u2022 FPSO unit: typical ship-shaped FPSO whose characteristics are shown in \n\nTable 4-1; \n\n\u2022 DPST: Cartola, DP 1 Enhanced, whose characteristics are shown in Table \n\n4-2; \n\n\u2022 No tug is used to aid the operation; \n\n\u2022 Emergency shut-down conditions follow PETROBRAS offloading \n\nprocedures (PETROBRAS, 2009); \n\n\u2022 Offloading operating sector: the group evaluated that extending the \n\noperating sector up to 90\u00b0 (as proposed in Corr\u00eaa, 2012, Figure 1-12) \n\nwouldn\u2019t be possible because of hawser interference with FPSO \n\nstructures. Hence, the group proposed analyzing a different sector \n\ninstead, shown in Figure 4-1 on page 72.  The difference is that green \n\nsector is extended to 75\u00b0 at starboard only, and a conditional green sector \n\n(hatched one) is established between 75\u00b0 and 80\u00b0. Within this area, the \n\nDP shuttle tanker is allowed to stay during the offloading operation as long \n\nas the environmental conditions are mild and power demand is low \u2013 \n\nwhich is considered by the team to be less than 50% of rated power. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 70 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTable 4-1: FPSO premisses \nPremise Detail \n\nMooring Spread Mooring System \nLength over all 327.5 m \nBreadth 57.237 m \nStern thrusters or propulsion None \nHeading 211 degrees from true north; \n\nmaximum heading variation of 5 \ndegrees to each side \n\nRisers 14 production wells e 8 injection \nwells, 36 risers on the riser balcony \n\nStorage capacity 252,800m3 (1,600,000 barrels) \nInert gas system Operational \n Maximum production 28,440m3 or 180,000bpd (barrels \n\nper day) \nOffloading stations Both operational \nOffloading normal flow 6,000m3/h \nOffloading maximum flow 7,000m3/h \nPeople on board (POB) 110 people \nFacility\u2019s service life 25 years \nHose string 237 m-length, double carcass hoses \nHawser length 180 m \n\nS o u rc e : A u th o r  \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 71 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4-2: Shuttle Tanker premises \nPremise Detail \n\nVessel Cartola, DP 1 Enhanced \nBreadth 46 m \nLength overall 279 m \nSummer draft 16 m (full) \nLight draft 8 m (with 40.000ton ballast) \nDouble hull structure N.A. \nMain propeller Controllable pitch \nThrusters configuration 2 tunnel thrusters (bow and stern) \n\nand 1 bow azimuth thruster; \nStorage capacity 166,000m3 (1.050.633 barrels); \nOffloading through Bow Loading \nSystem (BLS) only \n\nN.A. \n\nReference position systems adjusted \nbetween shuttle and FPSO \n\nN.A. \n\nNo automatic oil leak detection, \nvisual detection only \n\nN.A. \n\nRadio communication in exclusive \nband \n\nN.A. \n\nFixed foam cannon system on deck N.A. \nInert gas system Operational \nPeople on Board 26 people \nTwo slop tanks (one clean and one \nwith hoses\u2019 wash water), capacity: \n2.000 m3 each \n\nN.A. \n\nSegregated ballast system N.A. \nLighting on deck; N.A. \nLeak containment on the deck with \nrelief valve to the slop tank; \n\nN.A. \n\nChain stopper, with hawser tension \nmonitoring available; \n\nN.A. \n\nPelican hook (easy to release cable) \nand bollard (250 ton) for tug \nconnection available on board; \n\nN.A. \n\nAntipollution kit (SOPEP) available \non board; \n\nN.A. \n\nS o u rc e : A u th o r  \n \n\n\n\n 72 \n\nFigure 4-1: Extended operating sector final proposal \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n4.4 Operating procedures \n\nThe procedures for Approaching, Mooring, Offloading, Unmooring and Departing \n\nfrom FPSO are described in detail in PETROBRAS Offloading Guidelines \n\n(PETROBRAS, 2009). \n\nThe procedures determine system checklists, verification of environmental and \n\noperational conditions, speed and direction of approach, hawser and hose string \n\nconnection, hose string wash, cargo transfer, hawser and hose string disconnection \n\nand departure from location. \n\n4.5 Results for bow station \n\nIn total, 41 accident scenarios have been identified in the operation on the bow \n\nstation within the extended sector, using a DP 1 Enhanced shuttle tanker without \n\nauxiliary tug. These hazards have consequences for the safety of personnel, \n\nenvironment, facilities and for the company's image. \n\nIn total, eleven accident scenarios were classified as not tolerable risks to the \n\nenvironment because they are a combination of a catastrophic consequence, which \n\n\n\n 73 \n\nis large-scale oil leak from a FPSO cargo tank in case of collision, with a \u201cnot likely\u201d \n\nprobability of occurrence. These scenarios are related to human error, blackout \n\nevents, sudden change in weather conditions and drive-off event, which is the most \n\ndangerous situation during offloading operations, since the DPST might collide with \n\nthe FPSO at a higher speed if compared to a blackout scenario. Table 4-3 below \n\nshows the most relevant accident scenarios for the operation by the bow, and the \n\nrecommendations to mitigate them are shown in Table 4-4. \n\nIt is important to notice that the author disagrees with the conclusion of the group \n\nconcerning the frequency category of the scenarios of human error, blackout and \n\nsudden change in weather conditions, because they should be classified as \u201cremote\u201d \n\n(B) instead of \u201cnot likely\u201d (C). The justification for that is: (1) there is no reference in \n\nPetrobras\u2019 history that human error has ever caused a collision during offloading with \n\nDP shuttle tankers (while drive-off events, on the contrary, have) and (2) blackout \n\nevents and sudden change in weather conditions will probably not lead to a collision \n\nwith enough impact energy to cause the rupture of the side shell of the FPSO. \n\n  \nTable 4-3: Relevant accident scenarios in the operation through the bow station  \n\nPhase Hazard / Consequence Cause Freq.

These accident scenarios were conceived from the observation of \n\nemergency documents of some FPSO units, where, depending on the unit\u2019s loading \n\n\n\n 75 \n\ncondition, the flooding of the engine room generates shear forces and bending \n\nmoments that exceed the design limits. However, it is important to highlight that \n\nthese scenarios should be revised by the PRA group and re-classified into \nModerate category. FPSO projects already consider the flooding of the machinery \nroom scenario as required by MARPOL Convention (IMO, 1973); hence, it is unlikely \n\nthat a FPSO may sink due to this scenario. Moreover, shear forces and bending \n\nmoments\u2019 envelopes are applicable to intact stability analyses only. After consulting \n\nseveral PETROBRAS and Bureau Veritas specialists on the subject, the author \n\nconcluded that these scenarios present an extremely remote probability of \n\noccurrence.  \n\nTable 4-5 below presents those 11 scenarios, which were classified as \u201cnot \n\ntolerable\u201d by the PRA team. The recommendations for mitigating those risks are the \n\nsame as shown in Table 4-4 for operation at the bow station and may also reduce the \n\nrisks to Moderate category.  \n\n \nTable 4-5: Not tolerable accident scenarios in the operation through the stern station  \n\nPhase Hazard / Consequence Cause Freq.

The following conclusions \n\nare considered valid for both Campos and Santos Basins: \n\n\u2022 The \u201cNot Tolerable\u201d risks, both at the bow and stern stations, are mainly \n\nrelated to the occurrence of drive-off; \n\n\u2022 These not tolerable risks involve large-scale oil leak from and FPSO cargo \n\ntank when offloading by either bow or stern; \n\n\u2022 The recommendations assessed by the group of specialists were \n\nconsidered sufficient to reduce the risk of these scenarios to \u201cModerate\u201d; \n\n\u2022 The use of a DP Class 2 shuttle tanker with adequate power can reduce \n\nthe risk of collisions during offloading in the extended sector both at the \n\nbow and at the stern;  \n\n\u2022 With the increase of the operational sector limit from 60 to 80 degrees, \n\nwithout increasing the red sector limit of 90 degrees, the yellow sector \n\nspan was reduced from 20 degrees to 5 degrees and red sector span of \n\n10 degrees to 5 degrees. With these reductions, the available time for \n\nreaction becomes smaller. Therefore, during offloading in the extended \n\nsector, attention must be doubled to changing environmental conditions \n\nand shuttle heading; \n\n \n\nWhen comparing the results from the present risk analysis to the ones given by \n\nCorr\u00eaa (2012), it is possible to notice that the frequency of some scenarios was more \n\nconservative (higher) in this study than in Corr\u00eaa\u2019s one (while here the expected \n\nfrequencies for operating with DPSTs are \u201cNot Likely\u201d, Corr\u00eaa indicates \u201cRemote\u201d \n\nand \u201cExtremely Remote\u201d). This is because the PRA team feared that by operating in \n\nthe extended sector, in case of drive-off event, the DPST Captain would have fewer \n\noptions to perform an escape maneuver to avoid collision with the FPSO, if needed, \n\nand the chances of running into the platform would be higher. Figure 4-2 illustrates \n\nthe escape maneuver routes to avoid collision in each operating sector. That would \n\nbe the greater difference between operating in the extended and original sector: the \n\nrisk of collision can be higher if no recommendations are put into place. \n\n\n\n 77 \n\n \nFigure 4-2: Escape maneuver routes when operating in original sector (left) and extended \n\nsector (right) \n\n \nS o u rc e : D o u g la s  G u s ta v o  T a k a s h i Y u b a  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n 78 \n\n5 OFFLOADING DOWNTIME ANALYSIS \n\nThis chapter describes the calculation methodology and results of the availability \n\nof the offloading operation in Campos and Santos basins, comparing the values to \n\nthe original operating sector and the extended one. \n\nThe term \"availability\", or \u201cuptime\u201d, must be understood as the percentage of time \n\nin which an offloading station (or both) is available for performing offloading. This \n\navailability is based on the operational sector and the position-keeping capacity of \n\nthe DPST and should not be confused with the availability of offloading equipment \n\n(reel, HPU, pumps and cargo valves, etc.), which is defined by reliability engineering. \n\nThis term can also be understood as the probability of success of offloading, \n\nwhich represents the chance of a shuttle tanker getting to the location and being able \n\nto accomplish the offloading operation during 36h (6h connection + 24h operation + \n\n6h-off) without interruptions.  \n\nThe opposite of \"availability\" \u2013 \"unavailability\" or \u201cdowntime\u201d \u2013, is the mostly used \n\nterm in the following sections. \n\n5.1 Premises \n\nThe following sections describe the premises used in this study regarding \n\nlocation, environmental conditions, vessel and operating limits. \n\n5.1.1 Basins \n\nTwo FPSO\u00b4s are used as case studies in this section. The FPSO P-50 is located \n\nin Albacora Leste field, in Campos Basin. The FPSO Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo is located \n\nin the Lula field (Santos Basin). Figure 5-1 shows the location of both fields. \n\n\n\n 79 \n\nFigure 5-1: Location of the FPSOs chosen for this study \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\n5.1.2 Environmental conditions \n\nThe occurrence of simultaneous environmental agents as bi-modal wave, wind \n\nand current were considered in this analysis.  \n\nHindcast data was available for both locations. The data consisted in the \n\nmodelling of environmental conditions in the period of 6 years between 01/01/2004 \n\nand 31/12/2009 with 3 intervals in 3h totaling 17,536 cases for each field. The long-\n\nterm computation of the environmental agents is based on numerical models \n\nvalidated/calibrated by some sparse monitoring campaigns in specific locations of \n\nCampos and Santos Basin as explained in section 2.5. The environmental data used \n\nin the present project are based on the same used for defining the official Metocean \n\nof Campos and Santos Basin adopted by PETROBRAS. A detailed description of the \n\nmathematical model adopted is presented by Andrioni et al.  (2012). \n\n\n\n 80 \n\nFigure 5-2 shows the frequency, direction and intensity of each environmental \n\nagent for the Albacora Leste field and Figure 5-3 shows the environmental data for \n\nLula field. It should be noted that environmental data for wind, wave and swell show \n\nthe direction of incidence, while the current data show the direction of propagation. \n\n \nFigure 5-2: Environmental conditions for Albacora Leste field \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n  \n\n5%\n\n10%\n\n15%\n\nW  E\n\nS\n\nNW NE\n\nSW SE\n\nWNW ENE\n\nWSW ESE\n\nNNW NNE\n\nSSW SSE&lt;1.5\n1.5 - 2\n2 - 2.5\n2.5 - 3\n3 - 3.5\n3.5 - 4\n4 - 4.5\n4.5 - 5\n5 - 5.5\n5.5 - 6\n\nWave (Hs)\n\nm 5%\n10%\n\n15%\n\nW  E\n\nS\n\nNW NE\n\nSW SE\n\nWNW ENE\n\nWSW ESE\n\nNNW NNE\n\nSSW SSE 0 - 0.5\n0.5 - 1\n1 - 1.5\n1.5 - 2\n2 - 2.5\n2.5 - 3\n3 - 3.5\n\nSwell\n\nm\n\n10%\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\nW  E\n\nS\n\nNW NE\n\nSW SE\n\nWNW ENE\n\nWSW ESE\n\nNNW NNE\n\nSSW SSE&lt;4\n4 - 6\n6 - 8\n8 - 10\n10 - 12\n12 - 14\n14 - 16\n16 - 18\n\nWind\n\nm/s\n\n10%\n20%\n\n30%\n40%\n\nW  E\n\nS\n\nNW NE\n\nSW SE\n\nWNW ENE\n\nWSW ESE\n\nNNW NNE\n\nSSW SSE&lt;0.2\n0.2 - 0.3\n0.3 - 0.4\n0.4 - 0.5\n0.5 - 0.6\n0.6 - 0.7\n0.7 - 0.8\n0.8 - 0.9\n0.9 - 1\n\nCurrent\n\nm/s\n\n\n\n 81 \n\nFigure 5-3: Environmental conditions for Lula field \n\n  \n\n  \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\nFigure 5-4 shows a comparison of annual environmental conditions of the two \n\nlocations.

Thus, these limits were adopted in the \n\ndowntime study as the trigger for offloading interruption or non-start. \n\nBow Tunnel Thruster x = 127m  y = 0m +/- 31tonf 2200kW\nBow Azimuth Thruster x = 122m  y = 0m +38tonf; -24 tonf 2200kW\nStern Tunnel Thruster x = -111m  y = 0m +/- 29tonf 1935kW\n\nStern Azimuth Thruster x = -91m  y = 0m +38tonf; -24 tonf 2200kW\nMain Propeller x = -125m  y = 0m +211tonf; -135 tonf 18.881kW\n\nRudder\n\nActuator Max.

In \n\nthis mode, the ship operates with a fixed reference point (center of rotation), which is \n\nthe shuttle\u2019s midship section, and in weathervane mode, which means that the \n\nshuttle automatically aligns with the resultant of environmental conditions to minimize \n\nthrusters\u2019 demand. The Bow Rotation mode is also a weathervaning mode, but in \n\nwhich the fixed reference point is the bow of the shuttle, not the midship section. The \n\nHeading Restriction mode is a Bow Rotation mode added to a one-side-only heading \n\nrestriction, which forbids the shuttle\u2019s heading to surpass the grey limit on one side \n\nbut allows the shuttle to freely weathervane between grey and green limits.  \n\nChanging from Normal Mode to Bow Rotation mode on the green sector limit \n\nwould be a good solution, because this would allow a significant decrease in power \n\ndemand. Originally, when the DPST attaints the green sector limit, the Captain tries \n\nto hold the shuttle in position changing the DPS to Auto Position Mode \u2013 which is a \n\nfixed position and fixed heading mode \u2013 so that the operation is not interrupted. This \n\n                                            \n3 This is due to technical restrictions on the software only. The fact that the sector is increased by 5\u00b0 \non portside is not a concern, since yellow and red sectors are kept the same, i.e., 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 \nrespectively.  \n\n\n\n 85 \n\nsituation usually increases the power demand on the thrusters. The inclusion of the \n\nBow Rotation mode allows the shuttle to continue in weathervane mode as the bow \n\ncontinues inside the green sector, thus, reducing the power demand from the original \n\nalternative. \n\n \nFigure 5-6: Operating sector final proposition \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\n \n\nAs this alternative greatly approaches the hatched green sector proposition and \n\ncomplies with the PRA recommendation of operating in a misaligned heading so that \n\nthe escape route is facilitated in case of drive-off, this was the final operating sector \n\nconsidered in the following calculations. \n\n5.2 Calculation methodology \n\nTo calculate the offloading downtime, static analyses were used, programmed in \n\nMatLab software. It is based on an adaptation of computer code simulation \n\nTPN/Dynasim (Nishimoto, Fucatu and Masetti, 2002), (Nishimoto et al., 2003). This \n\nprogram performs a static evaluation of the available thrust on the DP system, to \n\nverify if the shuttle is able to counter the resulting environmental forces and keep \n\nDP operating mode \nfrom -50\u00b0 to +70\u00b0: \n\nNormal \n\nDP operating mode \n@75\u00b0: Bow Rotation \n\nDP operating mode  \n@85\u00b0: Heading \n\nRestriction \n\n\n\n 86 \n\nposition for each environmental condition of the hindcast data. The equations for \n\ncalculating environmental forces over the hull are described in section 3.1. \n\nThe application of dynamic simulations would be more complete than static \n\nsimulations, but that would require a very high computational time due to the large \n\nnumber of environmental conditions and headings to be analyzed.  \n\nFor static analysis, the geometry of the FPSO hull is not used, since the program \n\nis not able to account for hulls interference. Only the relative heading between \n\nvessels is considered in order to check the possible positions for the shuttle within \n\nthe extended sector. That is considered a conservative hypothesis, because in most \n\ncases the shadow effect reduces the forces acting on the DPST, since it is on the \n\ndownstream position. There are some few cases, however, where the environmental \n\nforce is amplified due to the change on current/wind flow direction by the FPSO (see \n\nfor example Illuminati et al., 2009), but they are exceptions. Hence, for downtime \n\ncalculation, it is expected that the shadow effect will increase the uptime that is \n\ncalculated with the hypothesis of no-shadow effect.  \n\nIn the first step, the routine creates a three-dimensional vector of boolean values \n\nand verifies if the vessel has enough power to maintain position or not for all the \n\n17,537 environmental conditions, 71 DPST headings and 2 loading conditions \n\n(loaded and ballast). The routine assigns zero to the cells if the shuttle cannot \n\nmaintain position and one if it can. \n\nThe logical structure of this part of the routine is as follows: \n\n \nFor each loading condition (l = 0 to 1) (Loaded and Ballast) \n\nFor each shuttle tanker heading (h = 1 to 71) (0\u00ba to 355\u00ba with 5 deg \nincrements4) \n\nFor each environmental condition (e = 1 to 17 537 cases) \nGet static forces and momentum from wave, wind and current \n(attribute to Fenv vector) \nPerform thrust allocation of -Fenv on the vessel and check if \nit is feasible \nIf not feasible, vector_feasilibity [l, h, e] = 0 \nIf feasible, vector_feasilibity [l, h, e] = 1 \n\nEnd_for \nEnd_for \n\nEnd_for \n \n\n                                            \n4 Although the DPTS will only operate inside the green sector limits, the calculation of environmental \nforces and thrust allocation is performed from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in order to give more flexibility to the \navailability analysis. Having the data of all the possible headings allows the user to choose a wide \nrange of operating sector angles on the following step to calculate their uptime and later compare the \nresults.  \n\n\n\n 87 \n\nNext, in possession of the feasibility vector and probabilities of occurrence of \n\neach environmental condition (which is 1/17,537), the routine calculates the uptime \n\nand downtime of the offloading operations by the bow station, by the stern, and by \n\nboth (bow and stern) as follows: \n \nGiven the heading of FPSO and operational sector limit angles \n \nFor each environmental condition (e = 1 to 17 537 cases) \n \n\nCheck if there is at least one heading inside the green sector for \nwhich it is possible to carry out the offloading in loaded condition by \nthe bow \n\nIf possible, check if there is at least one heading inside the \ngreen sector for which it is possible to carry out the offloading \nin ballast condition by the bow \n\nIf possible, verify if the next 12 environmental conditions \nalso meet the previous two criteria \n\nIf true, increase the bow uptime by Prob[e]: \nUptime_bow = Uptime_bow + Prob[e] \nand count_upbow[e]=1  \n**this last counter helps later to calculate uptime of \nbow-stern \n \n\nCheck if there is at least one heading inside the green sector for \nwhich it is possible to carry out the offloading in loaded condition by \nthe stern \n\nIf any, check if there is at least one heading inside the green \nsector for which it is possible to carry out the offloading in \nballast condition by the Stern \n\nIf possible, verify if the next 12 environmental conditions \nalso meet the two previous criteria \n\nIf true, increase the Stern uptime by: \nUptime_stern = Uptime_stern + Prob[e] \nand count_upstern[e]=1 \n**this last counter helps later to calculate uptime of \nbow-stern \n \n \n\nIf count_upbow[e] = 1 OR count_upstern[e] = 1 then increase the uptime \nof the bow-stern \n\nUptime_bowstern = Uptime_bowstern + Prob[e] \n \nEnd_for \n \n\nFigure 5-7 illustrates how the routine works, testing for all possible headings \nwithin the bow and stern sectors, if there is at least one solution for a given \nenvironmental condition. \n \n\n\n\n 88 \n\nFigure 5-7: MatLab routine logic \u2013 evaluation of the existence of at least one solution for a \ngiven environmental condition \n\n \nS o u rc e : (C o rr\u00ea a  e t a l., 2 0 1 3 ) \n\n \n\nThe acceptance criteria for an environmental condition to be accounted for as \nuptime for a particular offloading station are as follows: \n\n \n1. Hs is less than 3.5m (contractual limit) \n2. Wind speed is less than 40 knots (contractual limit) \n3. If environmental forces tends to push the ship towards the FPSO, this force \n\nmust be less than 22 kN (which is equivalent to a wind of 10 knots and 1m \nHs wave, to ensure that the shuttle is not operating at the unfavorable \nstation) \n\n4. The thrust of the most requested propeller is less than 80% (dynamic \nallowance, explained in sections 2.3 and 3.1) \n\n5. Shuttle\u2019s roll amplitude is less than 6\u00b0 (to guarantee comfort on board of the \nST, according to Captains\u2019 experience) \n\n6. Operating window of 36 hours is met (6h for connection, 24 hours for \noffloading and 6h for disconnection). \n\n \nThe above-described routine can be used to calculate the availability of the \n\noffloading given the heading of the FPSO and the operating sector limit angles. Thus, \nit is possible to calculate the downtime for both basins (because FPSO headings are \ndifferent) and for both sectors \u2013 original (-45\u00b0/+60\u00b0) and extended one (-45\u00b0/+75\u00b0). \n\n\n\n 89 \n\nThis allows to calculate the uptime gain due to the extension of the operating sector \nand to compare the results of both basins. \n\n5.3 Seasonal uptime results \n\nSince the environmental data from Campos and Santos Basins show that \n\nsummer and winter present very different conditions, it is important to present \n\nseasonal (monthly based) uptime results. \n\nFigure 5-8 presents the results of offloading seasonal uptime comparing the \n\noriginal sector of 60\u00b0 and the extended sector of 75\u00b0 for Campos Basin, and Figure \n\n5-9 shows the results for Santos Basin. The blue lines represent bow station, red \n\nlines represent stern station, yellow lines represent global system (bow and stern) \n\nand black line represent maximum uptime due to contractual limits. Triangles \n\nrepresent extended sector and asterisks represent original sector. \n\nIt can be seen that extending the green sector from 60 to 75 degrees is beneficial \n\nfor both offloading stations in every season of the year and that the global operation \n\nuptime approaches even more from the maximum uptime due to contractual limits. \n\n \nFigure 5-8: Offloading uptime (Campos Basin) \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\n\n\n 90 \n\nFigure 5-9: Offloading uptime (Santos Basin) \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\nOne interesting point to be noted from the previous graphics is that, in Campos \n\nBasin, the bow station is more advantageous than the stern station in most months of \n\nthe year except for the month of May. In some months of the year, it was found a \n\ndifference of 60% more availability for bow station than for stern station. Even \n\nthough, the stern station plays an important part for the global uptime, which remains \n\nvery close to the contractual limits\u2019 uptime.  \n\nResults for Santos Basins, however, show that stern station is preferable during \n\n5 months of the year and that availability differences between the two stations are \n\nsmaller than in Campos Basin.  \n\nThe following graphics, Figure 5-10 and Figure 5-11, show the actual uptime gain \n\non each station and on the global system for both basins. This graphic is done by \n\nsubtraction of the triangles lines by the asterisks lines on Figure 5-8 and Figure 5-9. \n\nIt can be seen that for Campos Basin an annual uptime gain of 9.1% was found \n\nfor bow station and 8.6% for stern station. The global system presents an annual \n\navailability gain of 3.0%. By analyzing each month individually, it is noticed that some \n\nmonths may present uptime gains of up to 19% (bow station, month of May) or as \n\nlow as 4% (bow station, month of February).  \n\n\n\n 91 \n\nAs for Santos Basin, the uptime gain is even more significant, around 10.6% for \n\nbow station, 13.2% for stern station and 4% for the global system (annual average). \n\nBy analyzing each month individually, it is noticed that some months may present \n\nuptime gains of up to 18% (stern station, month of February) or as low as 2.5% (bow \n\nstation, month of August). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-10: Offloading uptime gain for Campos Basin \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\n\n\n 92 \n\nFigure 5-11: Offloading uptime gain for Santos Basin \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\n5.4 Probability of disconnections during offloading \n\nIt is important to notice that even if the 36-hour window is not met in real life, the \n\nshuttle may be able to start the offloading in one station and change stations if the \n\nweather changes. Changing stations represent an important loss of time, since the \n\nST has to disconnect from one station and re-connect to the other one. However, it \n\ngives the operator more flexibility to offload, especially if the FPSO is close to top. \n\nThe probability pf disconnection during offloading would be an interesting \n\ninformation to calculate, however, no specific methodology was developed in this \n\nstudy for that. Nonetheless, it is possible to assess this issue in a simplified manner. \n\n Since the probability of finding a 36h window on a single station is higher for the \n\nextended sector than for the current sector, it is clear that the probability of not \n\nmeeting the required window and perform a disconnection is smaller, though this \n\nprobability is not quantified. \n\nThus, it is possible to say that, by operating in the extended green sector, it is \n\nless likely that the DPST has to change stations to continue with the oil transfer. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 93 \n\n6 DP SYSTEM POWER DEMAND \n\nThis section presents the discussion about another advantage of extending the \n\noffloading operating sector. As previously mentioned in the Introduction, section 1.6, \n\nby operating in the extended sector, the shuttle tanker can better align with \n\nenvironmental conditions which would decrease the power demand on the thrusters \n\nand hence the risk of blackout. The comparison between the optimized power \n\ndemand on the DP system when the vessel operates in original and extended \n\nsectors is shown below. \n\n6.1 Calculation methodology \n\nIn order to compare the power demand on both sectors, the results from \n\ndowntime analysis routine were used. As explained in section 5.2, the MatLab routine \n\ndetermines for all environmental conditions and all shuttle headings if it is able to \n\nkeep position or not by calculating environmental loads over its hull and allocating \n\nthrust on the propellers.  \n\nWith this information, it is possible to find for each environmental window of 36h \n\nthe optimized DP power demand to the operation. This can be done both for normal \n\nand extended sectors. By comparing the optimized power demand, it is possible to \n\nconclude if the extended sector helped the shuttle to find a more comfortable \n\nheading, with less power demand. \n\nThe logic of the routine is as follows: \n\n \n\n1. For the original green sector, find every environmental window that allows \n\nthe offloading operation to take place; \n\n2. For each of these windows, find the optimized DP power demand as \n\nfollows:  \n\ni. For every environmental condition within the 36hour-window, \n\nfind the optimum heading inside the sector which requires the \n\nminimum DP power demand; \n\nii. The optimized power demand for the window, i.e., the whole \n\noperation, will be the highest power demand found in item i. \n\n3. Keep the optimized power demand value on a specific vector; \n\n\n\n 94 \n\n4. Do steps 1 to 3 for extended sector; \n\n5. Compare results through histograms. \n \n\nThis methodology is applied for bow station, stern station and global system for \n\neach month of the year.  \n\nAn important point to be noted is that the environmental conditions that had \n\nsolution in the extended sector only were not considered for the comparison of DP \n\npower demand. Only the conditions that had solutions in both sectors were taken into \n\naccount, otherwise the comparison would be unfair, since the ultimate goal here is to \n\nunderstand what is the gain in terms of safety when extending the green sector. \n\nAfter calculating the optimized DP system utilization for all environmental \n\nwindows for both sectors, several histograms were generated showing how many \n\ncases (environmental windows) request the following ranges of power on the DP \n\nSystem: \n\n\u2022 0 to 10% \n\u2022 10 to 20% \n\u2022 20 to 30% \n\u2022 30 to 50% \n\u2022 50 to 80% (maximum utilization, discussed in 5.2) \n\nThe histograms were generated for Campos and Santos Basins, for original and \n\nextended sectors, and for bow and stern stations, to facilitate comparison, each one \n\nshowing the power demand in every month of the year. \n\n6.2 Results \n\nThe next sections present the results for Campos and Santos Basins. \n\n6.2.1 Power demand in Campos Basin \n\nFigure 6-1 and Figure 6-2 below show the results for bow and stern stations \n\nrespectively. The y-axis represents all the cases (environmental windows) where the \n\nDPST can operate in both sectors (previous and extended sectors). The length of the \n\ncolor bars represents the percentage of cases where the DPST presents the average \n\npower demand corresponding to its color. The total sum of color bars corresponds to \n\n\n\n 95 \n\n100% of the cases, and the total number of cases is the same for previous and \n\nextended sectors. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-1: Average utilization of DP System for Bow Station (Campos Basin) \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n  \n\nFigure 6-2: Average utilization of DP System for Stern Station (Campos Basin)  \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\nCampos Basin (Stern) \u2013 Original Sector \n\nCampos Basin (Bow) - Original Sector \n\n\n\n 96 \n\nFirstly, it is possible to verify that the average utilization of the DP system is \n\nalways lower in the bow station compared to the stern station, regardless of \n\noperating sector. This is due to more favorable environmental conditions to offload by \n\nthe bow, as seen in section 5.1.2.  \n\nRegarding the operating sector, it is clear that for the extended sector there is a \n\npower demand reduction at both bow and stern stations. For example, for the stern \n\nstation in January, if the shuttle operates in the original sector the chances that the \n\npower demand is lower than 50% are less than 60%. However, if the shuttle operates \n\nin the extended sector, this chances increase to almost 80%. This indicates that the \n\nsector's extension could make the operation safer in terms of stress on the DP \n\nsystem and risk of blackout. \n\n6.2.2 Power demand in Santos Basin \n\nFigure 6-3 and Figure 6-4 show the results for bow and stern stations \n\nrespectively. \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Average utilization of DP System for Bow Station (Santos Basin) \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n \n\nSantos Basin (Bow) - Original Sector \n\n\n\n 97 \n\nFigure 6-4: Average utilization of DP System for Stern Station (Santos Basin) \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\nAs well as observed for Campos Basin, it is possible to see that the average \n\nutilization of the DP system is lower in the bow station than in stern station, \n\nregardless of operating sector. This is also due to more favorable environmental \n\nconditions to offload by the bow.  \n\nRegarding the operating sector, it is possible to see that power demand reduction \n\nalso occurs when operating within the extended sector and it is even more significant \n\nfor the bow in Santos Basin than for Campos.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\nSantos Basin (Stern) - Original Sector \n\n\n\n 98 \n\n7 REAL TIME SIMULATIONS \n\nThe last part of this study consisted in performing real time simulations with the \n\nparticipation of experienced DPST Captains so they could give their impression on \n\nhow safe the operation in the extended sector would be in real life. The simulations \n\nwere performed in the Maritime and Waterway Simulator, or Simulador Mar\u00edtimo \n\nHidrovi\u00e1rio (SMH-USP) in Portuguese, available at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo inside \n\nthe Numerical Offshore Tank Laboratory of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (TPN-USP) \n\nfacilities. \n\nThese simulations had three main objectives. First, to assess the opinion of \n\nexperienced Captains on the operation\u2019s safety in a realistic simulator. Second, to \n\ncompare DP System power demand in the original and extended sectors to confirm \n\nthat the extended sector may allow the shuttle tanker to consume less fuel. Third and \n\nmost importantly, to analyze if drive-off events during the operation in the extended \n\nsector were safely overcame by performing escape maneuvers to avoid collision with \n\nthe FPSO. As explained in section 4.7, this was one of the main concerns of the \n\ngroup of specialists of the Preliminary Risk Analysis. \n\n7.1 The maneuvering simulator SMH-USP \n\nThe SMH is a simulator for analysis and training of waterway, port and offshore \n\noperations, which was developed by the University of S\u00e3o Paulo,  \n\nTRANSPETRO and PETROBRAS, with the technical collaboration of Brazilian Pilots \n\nAssociation (CONAPRA) in 2012. \n\nThe software is based on the TPN (Numerical Offshore Tank) numerical code \n\n(Nishimoto et al., 2002), which had several modifications, in order to perform real-\n\ntime simulations. It helps in performing various maneuverings in extreme conditions, \n\nwith different types of ship and in damaged conditions and/or command failures. \n\nNon-conventional operations, such as ship-to-ship berthing and maneuvering of hulls \n\nof future FPSO platforms (without propulsion), can also be examined beforehand \n\nusing simulation. \n\nThe simulator is equipped with 25 flat screen TVs giving a 360\u00b0 view of the \n\noperation, 10 command screens, levers to control tunnel, azimuth thrusters, main \n\n\n\n 99 \n\npropeller (fixed or variable pitch) and rudder, and DP system control station (in-house \n\ncode and/or Kongsberg DP system code). See Figure 7-1. \n\n \nFigure 7-1: TPN-USP\u2019s Full-Mission Simulator \n\n \nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 )  \n\n \n\nThe simulator is capable of considering the following variables: \n\n\u2022 Calculation of movement in six degrees of freedom; \n\n\u2022 Hydrodynamics of the vessel in open water considering external wave and \n\ncurrent; \n\n\u2022 Shallow water effects (bathymetric bottom) on the potential and viscous \n\nhydrodynamic efforts and on propulsion and maneuvering system; \n\n\u2022 Bank effects and interaction with other vessels; \n\n\u2022 Thrusters modeling (fixed or variable pitch), autopilot and dynamic \n\npositioning system; \n\n\u2022 Fenders, anchor and cables for docking and mooring simulations. \n\n \n\nAs the simulations are performed, the simulator outputs are recorded in a \n\nparticular hardware. These outputs comprehend videos, images of the vessel\u2019s trails, \n\ntime history graphics of vessels\u2019 motions (heave, roll, pitch, surge, sway and yaw), \n\npower demand on each thruster, hydrodynamic forces and others. \n\n7.2 Team \n\nAccording to Tannuri et al. (2014), \u201cthe simulators are never perfect, since \n\nmathematical models are simplifications of reality. Therefore, they must always be \n\nused in conjunction with the knowledge and experience of local conditions\u201d. Based in \n\nthis same idea, the team that participated in the real time simulations was composed \n\n\n\n 100 \n\nby two experienced DPST Captains (one of whom had participated in the PRA \n\nsections), four naval engineers from PETROBRAS and three simulator specialists \n\nfrom TPN (Figure 7-2 and Figure 7-3).  \n\nBefore the simulations took place, a calibration test was done a few weeks \n\nbefore, in the presence of another experienced Captain in order to adjust any items \n\nor parameters that he found necessary. On this day, a drive-off situation was tested. \n\nAfter discussing with the Captain about his perceptions, TPN staff provided a DARPS \n\nscreen to the facility and programmed the code so it would be possible to easily \n\nchange the thrusters command from the DP console to the manual levers. \n\n  \nFigure 7-2: Petrobras, TPN and Transpetro teams on the calibration simulations \n\n \nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 101 \n\nFigure 7-3: Transpetro and TPN teams during the actual simulations \n\n \n\n  \nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\n7.3 Simulation Cases \n\nAmongst the environmental hindcast data from Campos and Santos Basins, the \n\nmost significant conditions were chosen to be input into the simulations. These \n\nconditions were chosen because they represented either typical conditions from each \n\nbasin or intense conditions that would tend to push the DPST out of the original \n\ngreen sector. \n\nIn total, twelve simulations were performed with different shuttle tanker\u2019s draft \n\nand different environmental conditions, as shown in Table 7-1. All of them included \n\ndrive-off simulations to verify if the escape maneuvers would be successful and safe \n\n\u2013 which was assessed as an important concern in the Preliminary Risk Analysis \n\ndetailed in section 4. The focus was to compare thrusters demand in original an \n\nextended sector and to evaluate possible drive-off escape maneuvers in the \n\nextended sector.   \n\n\n\n 102 \n\nTable 7-1: Simulation Cases \nCase DPST Draft \n\nCurrent \n(dir. / knot) \n\nWind \n(dir. / knot) \n\nWave \n(dir. / Hs / Tp) \n\nSwell \n(dir. / h / t) \n\n1 Ballast W (266\u00b0) 0.74 \nSSE \n\n(103\u00b0) 21 \nSSE \n\n(113\u00b0) 3m 7.6s - - - \n\n2 Ballast S (185\u00b0) 0.8 \nSE \n\n(134\u00b0) 20 \nSE \n\n(133\u00b0) 3.3m 7.6s - - - \n\n3 Full S (202\u00b0) 0.74 \nSSW \n(206\u00b0) 15 \n\nSSW \n(192\u00b0) 3m 16s - - - \n\n4 Full S (202\u00b0) 0.74 \nSSW \n(206\u00b0) 15 \n\nSSW \n(192\u00b0) 3m 16s - - - \n\n5 Full SW (241\u00b0) 1 \nS    \n\n(181\u00b0) 10 \nS   \n\n(196\u00b0) 1.8m 9s - - - \n\n6 Full SW (241\u00b0) 1 \nS   \n\n(181\u00b0) 10 \nS   \n\n(196\u00b0) 1.8m 9s - - - \n\n7 Interm.

The results are summarized in Table 7-2 \n\nbelow. A detailed description of each of the simulated cases can be found in \n\nAppendix A. As the results show, most scenarios indicated that the extended sector \n\nis not only possible but also advantageous in terms of power demand. During the \n\nsimulations of these scenarios, the Captains felt comfortable all the time and \n\nconcluded that operating in this sector would be safely accomplished in real life. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n 103 \n\nTable 7-2: Results of real time simulations \n\nCase \nOperating in \n\nextended sector is \npossible \n\nExtended sector is \nmore advantageous \n\nin terms of power \ndemand \n\nDrive-off \nmaneuver is \nsuccessful \n\nNotes \n\n1 Yes Yes No [1] \n2 Yes Yes Yes [2] \n3 Yes No Yes [2] \n4 - - Yes [1] [3] \n5 Yes Yes Yes [2] \n6 - - No [1] [3] \n7 Yes Yes Yes [2] \n8 Yes - - [4] \n9 Yes No Yes [1] \n\n10 - - - [5] \n11 Yes Yes Yes [2] \n12 Yes Yes Yes [1] \n\nNotes: \n[1] Drive-off escape maneuver performed using main propeller and rudder only. \n[2] Drive-off escape maneuver performed using main propeller, rudder and all the thrusters. \n[3] Drive-off simulation only.

Vessel did not keep position because of inertia. \n\nS o u rc e : A u th o r  \n\n7.4.1 Power demand \n\nThe evaluation of power demand on each simulation is done through power \n\nhistograms, which are provided by the simulator and show for how many time during \n\nthe simulation each thruster attained the different levels of power demand. Dark red \n\ncolor represents the time a certain thruster worked between 50% and 100% of its \n\nnominal power, and dark blue color represents the time that this thruster was not \n\nused. Light blue, green and Orange colors represent, respectively, the time that a \n\nthruster was used at very low demand (from 0% to 12.5%), low demand (from 12.5% \n\nto 25%) and moderate demand (from 25% to 50%). So the more dark red areas on \n\nthe histogram, the more that thruster was demanded at full power. The more blue \n\nand green colors on the histogram, the more time the thruster had low demand. \n\nAs a summary from all the simulations, it can be said that extended sector \n\ngenerally showed to be less power demanding than original sector. This happens \n\nmostly for environments where wave and wind come from East and South East, or \n\nwhen strong currents come from the East (cases 1, 2, 7, 11 and 12). Figure 7-4 \n\nbelow shows the power histogram of Case 2. It is possible to notice a significant \n\npower reduction when the DPST changes position from original sector limit to \n\nextended one. \n\n\n\n 104 \n\n \nFigure 7-4: Case 2 \u2013 Power demand comparison between operation in original (top) and \n\nextended (down) sectors. \n!\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n!!!\n!\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n!!\nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\nTwo simulations (cases 10 and 11) also showed the importance of the hatched \n\ngreen sector. In these simulations, the DPST was only able to keep position at 80o in \n\nrelation to the FPSO. This confirms the uptime gain in extending the operating sector. \n\nFinally, two simulations (cases 3 and 9) did not show power consumption \n\nadvantages for the extended sector. Instead, case 3 even showed that the extended \n\nsector might be disadvantageous depending on the wave height and period coming \n\nfrom the South. In this simulation, the shuttle was positioned inside the extended \n\ngreen sector, it was submitted to beam sea and presented excessive roll motions \n\n(see Figure 7-5).

The \n\nescape maneuvers were performed in two different ways. First and most common \n\nway was using the rudder and all the thrusters to apply a moment to starboard on the \n\nshuttle to make the curve and escape from the FPSO. Second, which is a more \n\nconservative approach, was using only the ruder to turn the DPST away from the \n\nFPSO. It is important to notice that the main propeller is fully actuated forward on \n\nboth cases. \n\nThe performance and success of the escape maneuver can be analyzed through \n\na series of images that show the vessel\u2019s trail through time. They give an idea of the \n\nDPST\u2019s trajectory during escape maneuver and how far from the FPSO unit it went \n\nby. \n\nMost drive-off scenarios were successfully handled in the extended sector and \n\nthere were no collisions. Case 1 and 6 were exception. In these simulations, the \n\nCaptains performed the escape maneuver using main propeller and rudder only. The \n\nthrusters were not used to aid just as a conservative approach. In Case 1, a collision \n\ntook place and in case 6, although there was no collision, the DPST came too close \n\nto the FPSO.  \n\nDrive-off simulations showed that it is always recommended to perform escape \n\nmaneuvers using all available thrusters to minimize the risk of collision. When the \n\nweather tends to push the shuttle away from the FPSO, however, the maneuver can \n\nbe safely done with the main propeller and rudder only (this was possible in cases 4, \n\n9 and 12). Although most of the escape manoeuvers were successfully performed, \n\nthe Captains highlighted that it is safer that the shuttle\u2019s bow never points towards \n\nthe offloading station as usually done so it is easier to avoid collision in case of drive-\n\noff. \n\nFigure 7-7 and Figure 7-6 below show the comparison between drive-off escape \n\nmanoeuvers performed in cases 1, 2, 3 and 4. It is possible to notice through the \n\nDPST trajectory that the use of thrusters to aid the escape manoeuver is safer \n\nbecause it increases the distance to the FPSO. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 107 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 7-6: Cases 3 and 4 \u2013 Drive-off escape manoeuver using rudder and thrusters (left) and \nrudder only (right). \n\n  \nFigure 7-7: Cases 1 and 2 \u2013 Drive-off escape manoeuver using rudder only (left) and rudder and \n\nthrusters (right). \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n0.039kn 6265\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n-0.25kn 6265\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n-0.078kn 3213\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n-0.019kn 3213\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n0.078kn 4400-0.14kn 4800\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n0.058kn 4400\n\n3.5kn 4800\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n0kn 0.10.43kn 400.1\n0.51kn 800.1\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n0kn 0.10.039kn 400.1\n\n3.4kn 800.1\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n\n\n 108 \n\n8 FIELD TESTS \n\nAfter completing the previous steps proposed by the methodology of this work, it \n\nwas possible to gain confidence to test the operation with the new sectors in real life. \n\nThe main objective of performing the field tests was to evaluate the DP software \n\nupdate on an existing shuttle tanker, to test the transition between Normal and Bow \n\nRotation modes, between Bow Rotation and Heading Restriction Modes, and to have \n\nthe Captain\u2019s impression on the operation safety. \n\nFor this test to be possible, it was firstly necessary to choose the location, the \n\nFPSO and DPST to be used and to negotiate with Kongsberg the implementation of \n\nthe new sector on the shuttle tanker.  \n\nThe chosen location was Santos Basin, as this is the location with greater \n\nconcern since the beginning of the study. The choice of the vessel is merely a matter \n\nof respecting the premises of the Risk Analysis \u2013 DP Class II, following the \n\nrecommendations \u2013 and of choosing a shuttle that has operated several times at the \n\nchosen location. The chosen vessel was Brasil 2014, a Suezmax type, DP Class 2 \n\nvessel that had already good experience in Santos Basin. Finally, the choice of the \n\nFPSO depended only on the DPST schedule, since no set-ups needed to be done on \n\nthe FPSO side for this field test. \n\nThe test was performed in August 2015 and required 72 hours in total to be \n\naccomplished \u2013 36h of primary testing and 36h of offloading operation. Two experts \n\nfrom PETROBRAS and one expert from Kongsberg boarded the shuttle tanker in \n\nS\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o port to proceed to FPSO Cidade de Mangaratiba located in Santos \n\nBasin. The DP software update was performed during the trip to the offloading \n\nlocation and it only took half an hour to be completed5.  \n\nThe shuttle arrived at the destination on time and connected to the FPSO\u2019s bow \n\nstation following the normal procedures and approached the FPSO inside the \n\nextended sector. The offloading started and was entirely carried out under calm \n\nweather conditions that would have allowed the shuttle to operate even inside de \n\noriginal sector. \n\nAt a certain point, the shuttle\u2019s Captain was asked if he could position the vessel \n\ncloser to the limit of the extended sector (75\u00b0) in order to force the situation were the \n\n                                            \n5  The software update took one week of preparation onshore, and 30 min for installation onboard. \n\n\n\n 109 \n\nDP software would change from Normal to Bow Rotation mode and then to Heading \n\nRestriction mode. As this manoeuver would not put into risk the operation, he \n\npromptly agreed and re-positioned the shuttle. \n\nAs the shuttle overcame the limit of 75\u00b0, the DP software changed to Bow \n\nRotation mode as expected and it was possible to see that thrusters\u2019 power demand \n\nimmediately dropped down. This confirmed that the Bow Rotation mode requires less \n\npower from the DP system when the shuttle is operating at the limits of the green \n\nsector, as explained in section 5.1.5. Later, the shuttle finally attained the Heading \n\nRestriction limit and the software promptly altered the operation mode not to allow \n\nthe shuttle to surpass the limit of 85\u00b0 shown in Figure 5-6 on page 85. \n\nAs no adversities took place and the Captain of Brasil 2014 perceived no safety \n\nissues in operating inside the extended sector, the tests were considered successful \n\nand it was decided that it was possible to move on to the next stage, i.e., definite \n\nimplementation of the technology on the whole fleet (PETROBRAS, 2015c). \n\nThis stage involved official validation of the new sector inside PETROBRAS, \n\nmodification of offloading procedures and implementation on all DP Class II shuttles \n\nof the fleet \u2013 which means performing set-up of every DPST shuttle with every FPSO \n\nin the fleet, what roughly makes 748 set-ups to be completed (17 DP Class II \n\nshuttle\u2019s times 22 FPSOs times 2 offloading stations). \n\nThe official validation of the new sector was done by the department in charge of \n\noffloading operations and procedures inside PETROBRAS E&amp;P division after \n\nextensive discussions and participation of TRANSPETRO specialists.  \n\nThe new sector is already in operational in about 12 shuttle tankers in \n\nPETROBRAS and positive feedback has been received both by DPST Captains and \n\nby Kongsberg specialists. Figure 8-1 and Figure 8-2 show the images of Eagle \n\nParaiba shuttle tanker operating in the extended sector and a screen capture of his \n\nDP console showing the operation mode set to \u201cbow rotation\u201d. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 110 \n\nFigure 8-1: DPST Eagle Paraiba operating inside the extended sector \n \n\n \nS o u rc e : K o n g s b e rg  M a ritim e   \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8-2: Screen capture of DP console showing the operation in bow rotation mode \n\n \nS o u rc e : K o n g s b e rg  M a ritim e  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 111 \n\n9 CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe results presented in section 5 \u2013 Offloading Downtime Analysis \u2013 and in \n\nsection 6 \u2013 DP System Power Demand \u2013 show that the extended operating sector is \n\nadvantageous for increasing the offloading uptime, decreasing the probability of \n\ndisconnection during the operation and decreasing the average of thrusters\u2019 \n\nutilization of the DP shuttle tanker. \n\nThe Downtime Analysis shows that for Campos Basin an annual average uptime \n\ngain of 9.1% is found for bow station and 8.6% for stern station. The global system \n\npresents an annual availability gain of 3.0%. By analyzing each month of the year \n\nindividually, it is noticed that some months may present uptime gains of up to 19% \n\n(bow station, month of May) or as low as 4% (bow station, month of February). As for \n\nSantos Basin, the uptime gain is even more significant \u2013 around 10.6% for bow \n\nstation, 13.2% for stern station and 4% for the global system (annual average) \u2013 and \n\nby analyzing each month individually, some of them present uptime gains of up to \n\n18% (stern station, month of February) or as low as 2.5% (bow station, month of \n\nAugust). \n\nIt is important to highlight that availability gain is eventually translated as \n\neconomical gains to the operator, since it reduces the probability of offloading delays \n\nand top events. The delay in offloading operations generates extra costs of \n\ndemurrage of the shuttle tanker. The current daily rate of these DP shuttle tankers is \n\nabout US$ 55,000. Moreover, a top event may cost about 5,5 million dollars a day \n\n(considering a 100,000 barrels production plant with the crude oil brent price at \n\nUS$ 55).  \n\nThe Power Demand study shows that, when operating within the extended \n\nsector, there is a power demand reduction at bow and stern stations for both Campos \n\nand Santos Basin. This indicates that the sector's extension could make the \n\noperation safer in terms of stress on the DP system and consequent lower risk of \n\nblackout. \n\nThe Preliminary Risk Assessment presented in section 4 shows that the non-\n\ntolerable risk scenarios assessed are mainly caused by drive-off events. These \n\nscenarios\u2019 consequences are mainly associated with collision between the two \n\nvessels, representing risks for the personnel, environment, facilities and company\u2019s \n\nimage. When offloading by the bow or stern within the extended sector, a collision on \n\n\n\n 112 \n\nthe side of the FPSO can cause large-scale oil leak of a cargo tank. When offloading \n\nby the stern, a collision may cause flooding of the machinery room and severe \n\ndamage to facilities. However, the PRA group assessed several recommendations, \n\nwhich, when implemented, are considered sufficient to reduce the risk of these \n\nscenarios to \u201cModerate\u201d category. \n\nThe Real Time Simulations presented in section 7 complement all the other \n\nanalysis showing that: \n\n \n\n\u2022 for some environmental conditions, where the DPST cannot keep position \n\ninside original sector, the extended sector allows the operation to continue \n\nnormally, \n\n\u2022 for most of the simulated cases, even if the DPST is able to keep position \n\ninside original sector,  the extended one allows the shuttle to keep position \n\nin a more comfortable way, with reduced thrusters\u2019 power demand, \n\n\u2022 in case of drive-off event when operating in extended sector, it is possible \n\nto avoid collision with the FPSO by using all the thrusters, main propeller \n\nand rudder to aid the escape maneuver, and \n\n\u2022 the experienced Captains that participated in the simulations felt \n\ncomfortable all the time and concluded that operating in this sector would \n\nbe safely accomplished in real life.  \n\n \n\nAfter all the simulations were completed, a field test was carried out to evaluate \n\nthe implementation of the new sectors in real life. As no adversities took place and \n\nthe Captain of the tested DPST perceived no safety issues in operating inside the \n\nextended sector, the tests were considered successful and it was decided that it was \n\npossible to implement the new sector on the whole fleet.  \n\nThe final operating sector, which was validated through all the simulations and \n\nfield-testing, is the one shown in Figure 9-1. The new sector presents a \u201cBow \n\nRotation\u201d zone, in which the DP operation mode is changed from \u201cNormal\u201d to \u201cBow \n\nRotation\u201d when the shuttle tanker attaints the green sector limits (-50\u00b0 or +75\u00b0) and to \n\na \u201cHeading Restriction\u201d mode when the stern of the shuttle attains grey  sector  limit \n\n(-60\u00b0 or +85\u00b0) as  explained in section 5.1.5. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n 113 \n\nFigure 9-1: Validated operating sector \n\n \nS o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) \n\n \n\nAs a general and final conclusion, this study verified that the extension of the \n\ngreen operating sector can be incorporated into PETROBRAS\u2019 offloading procedures \n\nwithout increasing any risks to the safety of people, environment, facilities and \n\ncompany\u2019s image and represents good advantages in terms of uptime gain and \n\npower demand reduction. The new sector is already in operational in about 12 shuttle \n\ntankers in PETROBRAS and positive feedback has been received both by DPST \n\nCaptains and by Kongsberg specialists. \n\nAs a suggestion for future work, it is recommended to perform DP System \n\nreliability study together with quantitative risk analysis to determine the expected \n\nfrequency of collision between shuttle tanker and FPSO. Along with these studies, \n\nFinite Element analyses can be performed to determine the exact consequences of \n\ncollision and check if the severities of the scenarios assessed in PRA sessions are \n\nrealistic or too conservative.  \n\nAnother suggested activity is monitoring the DPST fleet to calculate the real \n\noffloading downtime and the frequency of use of the extended zone to compare with \n\nstatic analysis results and validate them. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 114 \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY6 \n\n2B1 CONSULTING.

Case 1 \n\nThe first case was a connection with the FPSO under environmental conditions \n\nfrom Santos Basin. Wave, Wind and current coming from SSE with moderate to high \n\nintensity (see Figure A-1).  \n\n \nFigure A-1: Case 1 \u2013 Environmental conditions \n\n \nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\n \n\nThis simulation started with a shuttle tanker heading of 6 degrees in relation to \n\nthe FPSO. It was noticed the difficulty to keep position with this heading, so the \n\nshuttle was then brought to the limit of original green sector 70 degrees (60 degrees \n\nin relation to the FPSO). At this point, the shuttle was able to keep position, but the \n\nthrusters were too much demanded, which according to the Captains was not \n\nrecommended because of equipment\u2019s heat-up. The heading was adjusted again, \n\nnow to the extended sector limit 80 degrees (70 degrees in relation to the FPSO) and \n\nit was possible to see that thrusters demand was reduced as expected. Figure A-2: \n\nshows the comparison of power histograms for both headings (70 and 80 degrees). \n\n  \n\n\n\n 124 \n\nFigure A-2: Case 1 \u2013 Power demand comparison between operation in original (top) and \nextended (down) sectors \n\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n!!\nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\nDrive-off was then simulated as if the pitch of the main propeller had locked on \n\nfull thrust ahead position. The Captains performed the escape maneuver as if all the \n\nother thrusters were unavailable to aid, so only the rudder was used. The Captains \n\nwanted to try this way because it is possible that together with drive-off the thrusters \n\nwill become unavailable. As it can be seen in Figure A-3, this maneuver was not \n\nsuccessful because the two vessels collided.  \n\n  \n\n-0.25kn 559\n-0.43kn 959-0.19kn 1359-0.078kn 17590.058kn 2159\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n0.37kn 5590kn 959\n0.23kn 1359-0.31kn 1759-0.16kn 2159\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\nTUNNEL BOW AZIMUTE BOW AZIMUTE STERN TUNNEL STERN MAIN\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nTi\nm\n\ne \n(m\n\nin\n)\n\nStavanger: Commands\n\n \n\n \n0.0%\n0.0%-12.5%\n12.5%-25.0%\n25.0%-50.0%\n50.0%-100.0%\n\n0.039kn 26510.039kn 3051-0.019kn 3451-0.039kn 3851-0.27kn 4251\n-0.16kn 4651\n\n0.25kn 5051-0.27kn 5451\n-0.54kn 5851-0.058kn 6251\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n0.097kn 26510.25kn 30510.039kn 34510.16kn 3851\n-0.35kn 42510.039kn 4651\n\n0.66kn 5051\n-0.25kn 5451-0.058kn 5851-0.12kn 6251\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\nTUNNEL BOW AZIMUTE BOW AZIMUTE STERN TUNNEL STERN MAIN\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nTi\nm\n\ne \n(m\n\nin\n)\n\nStavanger: Commands\n\n \n\n \n0.0%\n0.0%-12.5%\n12.5%-25.0%\n25.0%-50.0%\n50.0%-100.0%\n\n\n\n 125 \n\nFigure A-3: Case 1 \u2013 Drive-off escape using rudder only. \n\n \nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\n \n\nAt this point, the Captains highlighted that it is safer that the shuttle\u2019s bow never \n\npoints towards the offloading station as usually done so it is easier to avoid collision \n\nin case of drive-off, as shown in Figure A-4.  \n\n \nFigure A-4: Heading suggestion during offloading in order to avoid collision in case of drive-\n\noff. \n\n \nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\n \n\n0.039kn 6265\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n-0.25kn 6265\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\nShuttleheading awayfrom\nthe FPSO\n\n\n\n 126 \n\nA.2.

The \n\nCaptains observed that it would be not recommended to perform offloading in these \n\nconditions since the typical period of the waves is well beyond contractual limits, \n\nwhich is 9s. Too long waves may cause extreme pitch motions and hawser \n\nconsequent whips and stress. Moreover, these conditions tend to push the shuttle \n\ntowards the FPSO, increasing the risk of collision in case of blackout. Although it was \n\na typical case were the offloading by the Stern would me much more recommended \n\n(regardless of the period problem), the simulation was performed anyway for \n\nanalysis. \n\n  \n\n-0.078kn 3213\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n-0.019kn 3213\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n\n\n 129 \n\nFigure A-8: Case 3 \u2013 Environmental conditions \n\n \nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\n \n\nThis simulation began with a shuttle tanker heading of 27 degrees (-3 degrees in \n\nrelation to the FPSO). It was noticed that the power demand was not very high, and \n\nthe vessel could easily keep position although it was being pushed towards the \n\nFPSO. The pitch motion however was accentuated, going up to \u00b11,2o. Next, the \n\nshuttle was brought to the limit of original green sector 90 degrees (60 degrees in \n\nrelation to the FPSO). The pitch motions were reduced to \u00b10,8o, but the roll increased \n\nfrom almost zero to \u00b15,0o. When the heading was adjusted again, now to the \n\nextended sector limit 105 degrees (75 degrees in relation to the FPSO), it was \n\npossible to see that roll response increased even more to \u00b17,0o, which is actually \n\nexpected because in this situation the vessel is submitted to beam sea. Figure A-9 \n\nshows the comparison of power histograms and motions for the three tested \n\nheadings (27, 90 and 105 degrees).

Again the Captains highlighted the importance of \n\nthis simulation, because not only the thrusters can become unavailable during drive-\n\noff, but also other vessels, different from Stavanger, might have less azimuth \n\nthrusters and thus less escape capability. \n\n0.14kn 100.51kn 410\n0.49kn 810\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n0.21kn 10\n-0.35kn 410\n0kn 810\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n0.35kn 15340.058kn 1934-0.18kn 2334\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n0kn 1534\n\n0.058kn 1934-0.019kn 2334\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n0.058kn 2630-0.097kn 3030-0.12kn 3430\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n0.078kn 2630\n\n-0.39kn 3030-0.019kn 3430\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\nHeading 014+\nPhase 1\n\nHeading 070+\nPhase 2\n\nHeading 085+\nPhase 3\n\nTUNNEL BOW AZIMUTE BOW AZIMUTE STERN TUNNEL STERN MAIN\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nTi\nm\n\ne \n(m\n\nin\n)\n\nStavanger: Commands\n\n \n\n \n0.0%\n0.0%-12.5%\n12.5%-25.0%\n25.0%-50.0%\n50.0%-100.0%\n\nTUNNEL BOW AZIMUTE BOW AZIMUTE STERN TUNNEL STERN MAIN\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nTi\nm\n\ne \n(m\n\nin\n)\n\nStavanger: Commands\n\n \n\n \n0.0%\n0.0%-12.5%\n12.5%-25.0%\n25.0%-50.0%\n50.0%-100.0%\n\nTUNNEL BOW AZIMUTE BOW AZIMUTE STERN TUNNEL STERN MAIN\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\nTi\n\nm\ne \n\n(m\nin\n\n)\n\nStavanger: Commands\n\n \n\n \n0.0%\n0.0%-12.5%\n12.5%-25.0%\n25.0%-50.0%\n50.0%-100.0%\n\n[Order of thrusters in the histograms from left to right: Tunnel Bow, Azimuth Bow, Azimuth Stern, Tunnel Stern, Main propeller] \n\nTUNNEL BOW AZIMUTE BOW AZIMUTE STERN TUNNEL STERN MAIN\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nTi\nm\n\ne \n(m\n\nin\n)\n\nStavanger: Commands\n\n \n\n \n0.0%\n0.0%-12.5%\n12.5%-25.0%\n25.0%-50.0%\n50.0%-100.0%\n\n\n\n 133 \n\nOnce more, the recommendation of never pointing the shuttle\u2019s bow to the \n\noffloading station was made, and the recommendation of always using all thrusters to \n\nescape from collision. \n\n \nFigure A-13:  Case 6 \u2013 Drive-off escape maneuver using rudder only. \n\n \nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) \n\nA.7.

When the heading was adjusted again, now \n\nto the extended sector limit 105 degrees (75 degrees in relation to the FPSO), it was \n\npossible to see that roll response continued low as expected and that power demand \n\ndecreased a little more.

The Captains were then \n\nforced to position the shuttle to the extended sector limit (heading 85 degrees - 75 \n\ndegrees in relation to the FPSO), because even in original limit (heading 70 degrees \n\n- 60 degrees in relation to the FPSO) the tanker could not keep position. Even for this \n\nheading, the shuttle continued to drift off and the simulation was aborted.

The problem in this simulation was that when the \n\nweather started drifting the ship away from initial position, it gained too much inertia \n\nand when he was finally positioned on the most favorable heading, it still was not \n\nable to keep position. Case 11 was further done to repeat the approach, now with the \n\nrecommended heading. \n\nA.11. Case 11 \n\nThis case is a repetition from Case 10, but this time approaching with the \n\nrecommended heading of 85 degrees (75 degrees in relation to the FPSO), which is \n\nthe extended sector limit. The approach is performed with the DP system, because \n\naccording to the Captains the distance from the FPSO already allowed that. \n\nDue to environmental conditions, the power demand on the thrusters was very \n\nhigh and the Captains decided to change the heading to 105 degrees (95 degrees in \n\nrelation to the FPSO), which is on the red sector. Although this would not be \n\npermitted in real life, the Captains decided to do that only for analyzing the ship\u2019s \n\nbehavior. At this heading, the shuttle approached the FPSO safely. When it got to the \n\noperation distance of 150m, the heading was adjusted to 85 degrees (75 degrees in \n\nrelation to the FPSO - extended green sector limit) but it was possible to see the \n\n0kn 0.10.45kn 400.1\n0.53kn 800.10.23kn 1200\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n0kn 0.1\n\n-0.27kn 400.1\n\n-0.16kn 800.1\n\n-0.019kn 1200\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n\n\n 140 \n\npower consumption increased too much.

It was noticed that the power demand \n\nwas very high although the vessel was able to keep position. Next, the shuttle was \n\nbrought to the limit of original green sector, 60 degrees (60 degrees in relation to the \n\nFPSO), and then again to the extended sector limit, 85 degrees (75 degrees in \n\n-0.35kn 2762-0.35kn 3162\n\nTrajet\u00f3ria\n\n-0.039kn 2762\n4.2kn 3162\n\n2.79 2.795 2.8 2.805\n\nx 105\n\n9.0673\n\n9.0674\n\n9.0675\n\n9.0676\n\n9.0677\n\n9.0678\n\n9.0679\n\n9.068\n\n9.0681\n\n9.0682\n\n9.0683\n\n9.0684\nx 106\n\n\n\n 142 \n\nrelation to the FPSO). It was possible to see that power demand decreased \n\nrepeatedly for both limits.  \n\n Figure A-25 shows the comparison of power histograms for the three tested \n\nheadings (60, 70 and 85 degrees). The conclusion is that for this environmental \n\ncondition, the extended green sector presents good advantage for power \n\nconsumption.  \n\n \nFigure A-25: Case 12 \u2013 Power demand comparison between operation in original and extended \n\nsectors \n\n \n \n\nS o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 )  \n \n\nDrive-off was then simulated and the escape maneuver was performed \n\nconsidering the use of the rudder only because the conditions tend to push the \n\nshuttle away from FPSO.
