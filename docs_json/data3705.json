This paper reports the physical, chemical, mineralogical and microstructural \n\ncharacterization of three soils of the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and \n\ntheir mixtures with the chemical stabilizer RBI Grade 81 for geotechnical engineering \n\npurposes. The investigation consisted of: (i) one mature residual soil (soil 1) and two \n\nless weathered soils (soils 2 and 3) on gneiss; (ii) stabilizer contents of 2%, 4% and 6% \n\nregarding soil dry weight; (iii) mixtures specimens cured during seven days in a \n\nconditioning chamber; (iv) soils and mixtures specimens compacted at the standard and \n\nmodified Proctor compaction efforts, for microstructural characterization. The results \n\nindicated that the chemical stabilizer promoted considerable changes in all physical, \n\nchemical, mineralogical and microstructural properties of studied soils. There were \n\nobserved changes in texture and plasticity, increases in pH and CEC and decreases in \n\nexchangeable acidity. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) analyses indicated \n\nthat contents of Si and Al oxides in soils decrease after chemical stabilization, probably \n\nby solubilization of these oxides and Ca silicates and aluminates formation during \n\nhydration and/or pozzolanic reactions of chemical stabilizer with soils. With reference \n\nto mineralogy, the chemical stabilizer addition resulted in peak reduction of all clay \n\nminerals and the formation of rankinite, a Ca-silicate in a well-crystalline form, easily \n\nidentified by X-ray diffraction, strengthening the conclusions gotten from the EDS \n\nanalyses. The microstructure of soils subjected to high compaction effort (modified \n\nProctor) showed the development of microfractures and unconnected crack voids in \n\nsoil 1, whereas in the sand soils 2 and 3 we also observed widespread break of quartz \n\ngrains. The chemical stabilizer addition accounted for the formation of well-developed \n\ncementation nuclei, notably in soil 3 mixture. \n\nKeywords: Tropical soils; Chemical stabilization; RBI Grade 81 stabilizer; Physical, \n\nchemical, mineralogical and microstructural characterization; Geotechnical applications. \n\n\n\n \n\n 119\n\n7.1. Introduction \nThe perfecting of chemical stabilization techniques for tropical soils requires \n\nthe development of extensive laboratory and field experimentation to attain the \n\nengineering standards to comply with the technical norms. Regarding laboratory \n\nprograms, an important step to be executed is the characterization of the physical, \n\nchemical, mineralogical and microstructural characteristics of soils and their mixtures \n\nwith the chemical additives used, thus creating essential parameters for a complete \n\ntechnical assessment, together with data on the mechanical strength and durability of the \n\nend product. \n\nThus the objective of this study was to widen the Brazilian databank on the \n\nphysical, chemical, mineralogical and microstructural characteristics of soils stabilized \n\nchemically for geotechnical purposes, especially for highway applications. Three \n\nresidual gneiss soils of the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, mixed with the \n\nRBI Grade 81 chemical stabilizer were characterized technologically. \n\nRBI Grade 81 is chemical stabilizer commercialized by the Anyway Solid \n\nEnvironmental Solutions Ltd. Kerem Maharal Corporation for highway construction \n\napplications. In the last decade the product was recognized internationally as a highway \n\npavement layers stabilizer, in the functions of improving the subgrade, sub-base, base \n\nand first cover, which has been applied in several countries on the African continent and \n\nin some countries in Europe, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy. It has been little used in \n\nBrazil and the only reference is the construction of the base layer of the service patio of \n\nthe Vallourec &amp; Mannesmann do Brazil S.A. Corporation in Belo Horizonte, Minas \n\nGerais State, which showed promising results (LIMA et al., 2003). Regarding \n\nLaboratory studies on the Brazilian soils stabilized with RBI Grade 81, data recently \n\npresented in the studies by Caneschi et al. (2004), Fran\u00e7a (2003), Machado et al. (2001) \n\nand Trindade et al. (2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2006a, 2006b, 2006c) showed that the \n\nproduct accounted for substantial improvements in the mechanical properties of \n\ndifferent types of soils (ranging from highly plastic clays to sandy soils), but the most \n\nexpressive mechanical strengths gains generally occurred in mixtures of the chemical \n\nadditive with granular soils. \n\nThe following will be discussed as specific topics in the present study: (i) \n\ninfluence of the chemical additive content on the physical (Atterberg limits, grain size \n\n\n\n \n\n 120\n\n7.2. \n\ndistribution, grain unit weight), chemical (pH, cationic exchange capacity and potential \n\nacidity) and mineralogical soils properties; (ii) effects of applying different compaction \n\nefforts and the addition of chemical stabilizer on the microstructural characteristics of \n\nthe soils using images obtained from optical microscope (OM) and secondary electron \n\nsignals generated in a scanning electronic microscope (SEM); (iii) effects of the \n\nchemical stabilizer incorporation on chemical elements contents measured by energy \n\ndispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) analyses. \n\nMaterials and experimental methods \n\n7.2.1. Materials \n\nThe present study was carried out on three tropical soils derived from Pre-\n\nCambrian gneiss, forming a clay-sand-silt sample collected in the B horizon of a mature \n\nresidual soil (soil 1), classified pedologically as Red-Yellow Latosol, and two sand-silt-\n\nclay samples collected in the C horizon from two young residual soils (soils 2 and 3). \n\nThe soil stabilizing agent used was RBI Grade 81, at contents of 2%, 4% and 6% \n\ncompared to the dry soil weight. Further information on the soils and the chemical \n\nstabilizer assessed in this study can be found in Trindade et al. (2006a, 2006b). \n\n7.2.2. Methods \n\n7.2.2.1. Soils sampling \n\nThe samples were collected with hand tools in cutting trenches, packed in \n\n50 kg plastic bags and identified by labels containing the data on the soil origin.  The \n\nbags were then taken to the Civil Engineering Laboratory (LEC) of the Civil \n\nEngineering Department (DEC) at the University of Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa were \n\nat they were air dried, broken up, sifted through a 4.8 mm mesh and placed in plastic \n\nbags for later use. \n\n\n\n \n\n 121\n\n7.2.2.2. Physical and chemical characterization \n\nThe geotechnical characterization was carried out following the \n\nrecommendations of the Brazilian Technical Standards Association (ABNT). The tests \n\ncarried out were: (i) sieve analysis (ABNT, 1984d); (ii) determination of liquidity limit  \n\n(ABNT, 1984a); (iii) determination of plasticity limit and plasticity index  \n\n(ABNT, 1984c); and (iv) determination of grain unit weight (ABNT, 1984b). \n\nThe chemical analyses were performed according to the procedures of the \n\nBrazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA, 1997), and the mean value of \n\nthree determinations was considered for each analysis. The pH in H2O was determined \n\nby a potentiometer, using proportions of 1:2.5 (volume/volume) soil:solution. The Ca2+ \n\nand Mg2+ exchangeable cations were extracted in KCl 1 mol/L and determined by \n\natomic absorption spectrometry. The Al3+ cation, extracted by KCl 1 mol/L, was \n\ndetermined volumetrically by titrating with NaOH 0.025 mol/L. The potential acidity \n\n(H+ + Al3+) was determined by extraction with 0.5 mol/L calcium acetate at pH 7.0 and \n\nlater titrating with NaOH. The K+ and Na+ cations were extracted by Mehlich-1 \n\nextractor and determined by flame photometry. The following were determined from the \n\nresults of these analyses: (i) the sum of the exchangeable bases (SB): Ca + Mg + K + \n\nNa; (ii) cation exchange capacity (CEC): SB + (H + Al); and (iii) percentage base \n\nsaturation (V%): (SB / CEC) x 100. \n\nThe procedures recommended by the ABNT (1986a) were followed for the \n\npreparation of the disturbed samples for the laboratory tests, while the chemically \n\nstabilized soil samples used in the physical and chemical property characterization \n\nexperiments were prepared according to the description in the following paragraphs. \n\nThe samples of each one of the soils were placed in 2 kg plastic bags to which \n\nthe chemical additive was added in amounts of 2%, 4% and 6% content, then \n\nhomogenized to incorporate it uniformly in the soils to maximize the occurrence of the \n\nsoil additive reaction processes. Finally, each one of the samples received a quantity of \n\nwater necessary to reach the optimum moisture contents determined in the compaction \n\ntests carried out at the Standard Proctor compaction effort. The plastic bags were sealed \n\nand placed in a moist chamber with relative air humidity greater than 95%, then starting \n\nthe cure time of the mixtures. After seven-day cure time, the samples were air dried, \n\nbroken up in a pestle with a hand mortar and sieved through a 2 mm mesh. The \n\n\n\n \n\n 122\n\nhygroscopic moisture was determined in each one of the samples and experiments were \n\nperformed to determine the physical and chemical properties. \n\n7.2.2.3. Mineralogical characterization \n\nThe soil mineralogy (soils 1, 2 and 3, and adding mixture) was identified by X-\n\nray diffractometry, using the two soils fractions separated by the 53 ?m mesh. \n\nPowdered specimens from the ? 53 ?m fraction were mounted in excavated glass slide, \n\nusing neutral glue for fixing the sample, avoiding any orientation. Oriented samples \n\nwere mounted with the &lt;53 ?m fraction of analyzed materials, allowing the settling of \n\ndrops suspension onto a glass slide, followed by air-drying. \n\nAll samples were cobalt-irradiated (Co-K?) in the 4\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 2? interval, using \n\na X-ray diffractometer manufactured by Rigaku Radiation Shield Company set with a \n\nspeed of 2\u00b0 2?/min, fitted with a nickel filter. Data acquisition was made automatically \n\nat each 0.05\u00b0 2?. \n\n7.2.2.4. Microstructural characterization \n\nThe microstructural characterization was carried out by means of optical and \n\nscanning-electron microscopy and microanalysis, for soils samples 1, 2 and 3, as well as \n\nits mixtures with 6% of chemical stabilizer, which were previously cured for seven days \n\nin a wet chamber. \n\nFor thin sections prepared for optical microcopy, the following steps were \n\nconsidered: (i) the specimens were compacted in the optimum compaction parameters \n\n(wopt and ydmax) determined in the modified Proctor test (Table 7.2); (ii) mixture \n\nspecimens were cured in an acclimatized room for a period of seven days and after cure \n\ntime were oven-dried at 50 \u00b0C for 24 hours; and (iii) after, specimens were impregnated \n\nwith a resin mixture, using 450 mL of polyester resin, 550 mL styrene and 5 mL \n\ncatalyser; polymerization was accomplished after 30 days in a ventilated room, followed \n\nby thin sectioning, using a diamond-powder polishing system. Thin sections were \n\nphotographed in a Pentax camera fitted in a Olympus SZH binocular at plain light and \n\nmagnified 15X. All microstructural descriptions followed the recommendations of \n\nBullock et al. (1985). \n\n\n\n \n\n 123\n\nWith reference to SEM analyses, it was used small 1 cm3 compacted samples \n\nextracted from specimens compacted in the optimum parameters determined in \n\ncompaction effort of standard and modified Proctor tests (Tables 7.1 and 7.2). It should \n\nbe emphasized that the Brazilian standard and modified Proctor compaction tests are \n\nsimilar to the AASHTO standard and modified compaction tests. The samples were \n\ndried in a chamber at 50\u00b0 C for 24 hours and fixed on aluminum stubs using double \n\nfaced carbon adhesive tape. Next, a coating of approximately 20 nm of a palladium gold \n\nalloy was applied, using an FDU 010 model metalizer, manufactured by Balzers Inc., \n\nUSA. The samples were observed under a VP 1430-type scanning electronic \n\nmicroscope, manufactured by LEO Electron Microscopy Oberkochen, Germany, that \n\noperated at 15 kV. The metalization and scanning electronic microscopy were both \n\ncarried out at the Nucleus for Microscopic and Microanalysis (NMM) at the Federal \n\nUniversity of Vi\u00e7osa (UFV). \n\nThe compaction tests were carried out following the methodology \n\nrecommended by the ABNT (1986b), compacting the mixtures for between two to four \n\nhours after adding the stabilizer, following the usual procedures for soil-cement and \n\nsoil-lime mixtures. Tables 7.1 and 7.2 show the optimum moisture content values (wopt) \n\nand maximum dry unit weight (?dmax) of the soils and their respective mixtures used in \n\nmolding the specimens. Limits were fixed for specimen acceptance as proposed by the \n\nBrazilian National Highway Officials (DNER, 1994) in their preparation: maximum dry \n\nunit weight \u00b1 0.30 kN/m3 and optimum moisture content \u00b1 0.5%. \n\nTable 7.1.

The samples of soils 1, 2 and 3 and their \n\nmixtures with 6% of stabilizer were fixed on aluminum stubs using double faced carbon \n\nadhesive tape. Next, a coating of carbon conductor film was applied using a Balt-Tec \n\nMED 020 metalizer. After sample preparation, photographs were taken using a SEM \n\nmodel JEOL JSM 6360-LV attached to a backscattering detector and energy dispersive \n\nX-ray spectrometer (EDS) with Si(Li) 10 mm2 detector, 136 eV energy resolution, \n\nmanufactured by Thermo Electron Company. The analyses were performed at the \n\nCampinas State University (UNICAMP) Chemistry Institute, located in the city of \n\nCampinas, S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil. In the samples of soil 1 and its mixture prepared with \n\n6% of stabilizer were also performed microchemicals mapping from a 55 mm distance \n\n(surface-detector) at voltage of 20 kV and 5 A. After testing each sample the EDS was \n\nrecalibrated using a copper standard. Microchemicals maps of selected particles were \n\nobtained considering the most important chemical elements present in the tested \n\nsamples (Si, Al, Fe, S and Ca). EDS qualitative spectrums obtained from the analyses \n\nwere recorded in a computer hard disk for quantitative determination of chemical \n\ncomposition of each tested sample using a Noran System SIX Corporation dedicated \n\nsoftware that quantifies the percentages of each chemical element (Z > 11) based on the \n\nhypothesis that they are in the oxide form. The results of the analysis were based in the \n\naverage of 10 to 20 isolated determinations, as depicted in Figure 7.1. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7.1.

Physical and chemical properties of the soils and mixtures \n\nThe physical and chemical characteristics of civil engineering construction \n\nmaterials must be known to classify them for their potential uses. To meet this \n\nrequirement, physical and chemical characterization experiments were carried out on \n\nthe materials under study. \n\nThe results of the sieve and sedimentation analysis are presented in Figure 7.2. \n\nThis figure shows the grain size distribution curves of the soils and their respective \n\nmixtures with the chemical additive studied and the quantities of the clay (? ? \n\n0.002 mm), silt (0.002 &lt;? ? 0.06 mm) and sand (0.06 &lt;? ? 2 mm) fractions defined by \n\nthe grain size distribution scale proposed by the ABNT (1995). \n\nComparison of the grain size distribution curves in Figure 7.2 shows that the \n\nchemical additive altered the original particle distribution of all soils. It is believed that \n\nthe small particles in the soils agglutinated, forming larger sized flakes, as observed \n\nespecially in soil 1 (Figure 7.2a) where, with the increase in the amount of additive, the \n\npercentage of the clay fraction decreased significantly and the silt and sand fractions \n\nincreased. A small variation was observed in this performance in soils 2 and 3 (Figures \n\n7.2b and 7.2c, respectively), because with the increase in the additive content the \n\npercentage of the clay and silt fractions decreased but the sand fraction increased. When \n\n6% chemical additive was added to the soils, the percentages of particles smaller than \n\n0.002 mm decreased from 61%, 15% and 13% to 29%, 13% and 6%, respectively, in \n\nsoils 1, 2 and 3, proving that the predominant reactions were those of flocculation, \n\ncharacteristic in clay surfaces with a high concentration of Ca2+ ions. This conclusion \n\nwas reinforced by the observation that the modifications produced by the additive in the \n\ngranular soils were more significant in soil 1, which consisted of 61% clay particles \n\n(particle diameter less than 0.002 mm). \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 126\n\n0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100\n\nGrain size (mm)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nt f\n\nin\ner\n\n b\ny \n\nw\nei\n\ngh\nt\n\nSoil\nSoil with 2% of RBI Grade 81\nSoil with 4% of RBI Grade 81\nSoil with 6% of RBI Grade 81\n\n0 2 4 6\n    RBI Grade 81 (%)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nta\n\nge\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nt f\n\nin\ner\n\n b\ny \n\nw\nei\n\ngh\nt\n\n2.\n0 \n\nin\n1.\n\n5 \nin\n\n1.\n0 \n\nin\n0.\n\n75\n in\n\n0.\n37\n\n5 \nin\n\n# \n4\n\n# \n10\n\n# \n16\n\n# \n30\n\n# \n40\n\n# \n50\n\n# \n10\n\n0\n\n# \n20\n\n0\n\n0 2 4 6\n    RBI Grade 81 (%)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nta\n\nge 61\n\n14\n\n25\n\n45\n\n16\n\n39\n\n34\n\n19\n\n47\n\n29\n\n19\n\n52\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nt f\n\nin\ner\n\n b\ny \n\nw\nei\n\ngh\nt\n\n0 2 4 6\n    RBI Grade 81 (%)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nta\n\nge\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n13\n\n17\n\n70\n\n12\n\n16\n\n72\n\n9\n8\n\n83\n\n6\n8\n\n86\n\n1315\n\n22\n\n63\n\n15\n\n24\n\n61\n\n16\n\n15\n\n69\n\n15\n\n72\n\nSedimentation analysis Sieve analysis\n\nClay fraction\nSilt  fraction\nSand  fraction\n\nClay Silt\nSand\n\nGravelfine coarsemedium\n\n \nFigure 7.2.  Grain size distribution curves and percentages of clay, silt and sand fractions in soils and \n\nsoil-mixtures: (a) soil 1; (b) soil 2; and (c) soil 3. \n\n\n\n \n\n 127\n\nThe occurrence of significant grain size modifications in soils has been \n\nreported in the literature by Guimar\u00e3es (1971), who detected significant changes in clay \n\nsoils after adding lime at 3% and 5%, Osula (1996), who added 1%, 2% and 3% \n\nPortland cement and hydrated lime to a laterite, and Cristelo and Jalali (2004), who \n\nadded 2% hydrated lime to two residual granite soils. \n\nIn a recent paper on the determination of shear strength and elastic properties \n\nof soils-RBI Grade 81 mixtures via triaxial tests, Trindade et al. (2006b, 2006c) reported \n\ngains in the peak friction angle of specimens cured for seven days in a wet chamber and \n\nassociated them to changes in grain size distributions due to flocculation/agglomeration \n\nand consequent increase in soils grain size. This assumption is confirmed by data \n\npresented in Figure 7.2. \n\nTables 7.3 to 7.5 show the effects of increasing additive content on the grain \n\nunit weight (?s) of soils and mixtures. The addition of the stabilizer produced small \n\nalterations in the values of this parameter, as expected, because the product has ?s \n\napproximately equal 25 kN/m3 (ANYWAY, 2004), that is, a value close to those \n\nreported for soils without treatment. \n\nRegarding the consistency indices of the soils and mixtures, the data presented \n\nin Tables 7.3 to 7.5 show that generally there were slight increases in the plasticity limit \n\nvalues (PL) but reductions in the liquidity limit values (LL) and the plasticity Index (PI) \n\nof the soil with the increase in the quantity of chemical additive. The only combination \n\nthat showed a reduction in PL compared to the natural soil was the mixture of soil 1 \n\nwith 6% additive. \n\nThe changes in plasticity presented in Tables 7.3 to 7.5 suggest that there may \n\nhave occurred not only cationic exchanges but also alterations in the structure of the fine \n\nsoil particles via their flocculation and cementation. These results may reflect directly \n\non the performance of these materials in the field, affecting aspects and parameters such \n\nas workability, swelling and compaction moisture. Similar conclusions are reported by \n\nGuimar\u00e3es (1971), Transportation Research Board (TRB, 1976), Osula (1996), \u00c7ok\u00e7a \n\n(2001) and Cristelo and Jalali (2004) where hydrated lime, Portland cement and fly ash \n\nwere used as stabilizing agents. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 128\n\nTable 7.3.

Hilt and Davidson (1960) \n\nanalyzed the mechanical performance of clay soil and lime mixtures and considered the \n\npossibility of the existence of a limit condition at which, primarily, the stabilizer should \n\nmeet the affinity of these soils to lime, defining it as its lime fixation capacities. In this \n\nstudy, these authors concluded that: (i) the addition of small quantities of lime to clay \n\nsoils led to significant increases in net PL, and these were more expressive in soils rich \n\nin montmorillonite than those rich in kaolinite; (ii) the addition of amounts of lime \n\nlower than the soil fixation point can lead to significant changes in its workability, but \n\nnot in its mechanical strength. \n\nThus, when small quantities of lime are added to clay soils, significant \n\nvariations occur in their PL, but inexpressive changes in the mechanical strength, \n\nbecause there is no lime available for significant pozzolanic reactions to take place; for \n\nlarger quantities of additive, the PL tends to remain unaltered, verifying the availability \n\nof lime for pozzolanic reactions to take place that can lead, if they are reactive to lime, \n\nto significant variations in their mechanical strength. Thus the PL parameter can be \n\nconsidered a good indication of the lime fixation point of a soil. Similarly, Marks III \n\n\n\n \n\n 130\n\nand Haliburton (1970) widened this discussion, understanding that the lime fixation \n\npoint of a clay soil corresponds to the maximum compression condition of the diffuse \n\ndouble layer of its clay particles, and there is no later reduction in its plasticity, because \n\nthe superficial charges of these particles reached a condition of equilibrium. Thus in this \n\ntype of soil, there is a limit for plasticity reduction. In the present study, it was observed \n\nthat modifications took place in the soil consistency indices with the addition of the \n\nstabilizer, and small falls in LL and slight increases in PL were observed, except in soil \n\n1, and a gradual fall in PI, that was more pronounced in soil 1 stabilized with 2% \n\nadditive. When the concept of the lime fixation point was applied to the data in the \n\npresent study, it was associated with the 2%, 6% and 4% contents, respectively to soils \n\n1, 2 and 3, as shown in Figure 7.3. However, this type of performance was not observed \n\nclearly and easily in the mixtures analyzed here. \n\n \n\n0 2 4 6\nRBI Grade 81 (%)\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nPl\nas\n\ntic\nity\n\n li\nm\n\nit \n(%\n\n) 35\n\n42\n\n39\n\n36\n\n25 25\n27\n\n29\n\n20 20\n22 22\n\nSoil 1\nSoil 2\nSoil 3\n\n \nFigure 7.3.

Soils, for example, with high cationic exchange capacity are considered as \n\nbeing fertile. In the geotechnical area, these experiments have been carried out to assess, \n\nfor example, the degree of soil weathering, soil potential for liner applications in \n\nenvironmental geotechnical engineering and the soil reaction potential to chemical \n\nstabilizers. \n\nTables 7.3 to 7.5 show the results of the chemical characterization of the soils \n\nand soil-mixtures. The pH values, measured in water following the 1:2.5 volumetric \n\nsoil:solution ratio of soils 1, 2 and 3 were, respectively, 6.1, 5.4 and 5.3, characterizing \n\nsoil 1 as slightly acid and soils 2 and 3 as acid according to terminology by Guimar\u00e3es \n\n(2002). According to van Raij et al. (1987) soil pH values are generally between 4 and \n\n7, and values below this range indicate the presence of free acids and values above this \n\nvalue indicate the presence of saline or limestone soils. The cationic exchange capacity \n\n(CEC) values in soils 1, 2 and 3 were relatively low and compatible with the mineralogy \n\nof their clay fractions, which were predominantly composed of kaolinite and iron and \n\naluminum oxides, which are secondary minerals that have, respectively, CEC in the \n\nrange from 3 to 15 cmolc/kg (GUIMAR\u00c3ES, 1971) and 2 to 4 cmolc/kg (MEURER et \n\nal., 2004). Regarding the percentage base saturation (V%), soils 1, 2 and 3 presented \n\nvalues lower than 60%. According to Brady and Weil (1999), soils from tropical and \n\nwet regions, in which silicate clays predominate, are acid when V% is lower than 80%. \n\nTherefore the V% values are in line with the pH values determined and with the clay \n\nminerals present in the soils studied. The potential acidity (H+ + Al3+) values of soils 1, \n\n2 and 3 were, respectively, 0.99, 1.32 and 1.54, that is, they presented an inverse \n\nrelationship with the pH values, showing that the potential acidity and consequently, \n\nsome of the hydrogen and aluminum compounds influenced the pH means of the soils. \n\nBrady and Weil (1999) commented that the factors that account for soil acidity are \n\ncomplex, because there are two groups of dominant elements that exercise influence in \n\nthe soil at the same time: acidity derives from aluminum and hydrogen while most of \n\nthe other cations neutralize it. \n\nTables 7.3 to 7.5 show that when the chemical additive was added to the soils \n\nthere were significant increases in the value of the following chemical characteristics: \n\npH, sum of exchangeable bases (SB) (mainly due to the increase in the Ca2+ ions), CEC \n\nand V%. In contrast, there was an expressive reduction in the quantity of free hydrogen \n\nand aluminum and the quantitative sums of H+ + Al3+ became nil after stabilizing the \n\n\n\n \n\n 132\n\nsoils with the additive under study. In short, the incorporation of the chemical stabilizer \n\nin the soils accounted for the increase in saturation of bases and for the total \n\nconsumption of the exchangeable H+ + Al3+ ions, generating sharp modifications in the \n\npH from acid to alkaline. \n\nAmong the chemical characteristics assessed in the present study, the pH has \n\nbeen the most used in studies of soil chemical stabilization. It is known that increased \n\npH causes the partial dissolution of mineral constituents of the soils generally followed \n\nby the formation of new silicates and aluminates, stable in the new conditions, which \n\nassociate, forming a cement-like product capable of conferring high mechanical strength \n\nto the material (CHAUVEL and N\u00d3BREGA, 1980). For instance, some studies sought \n\nto establish dosing criteria based on the pH values of the stabilized material, such as the \n\nclassic study by Eades and Grim (1966) and recently the standard test method presented \n\nby American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1999). In these publications it \n\nis proposed a method to determine the ideal quantity of lime to stabilize a soil \n\ndetermining its lime reactivity level, which consisted of measuring the pH of the \n\nmixture after one hour. This value was then related to the quantity of lime consumed in \n\nthe reactions in this time interval relating the optimum lime content to the smallest \n\nquantity of lime that raises the pH of the mixtures to 12.4. However, it is believed that \n\ndosage criteria based on the pH value that causes attack on the silica and aluminum \n\npresent in the soil should be studied in depth, especially in the case of chemically \n\nstabilized tropical soils. Some studies carried out in tropical soils have reported that the \n\naddition of quantities from 2% to 5% Portland cement (PESSOA, 2004) and hydrated \n\nlime (LIMA, 1981; CARVALHO et al., 1981; PESSOA, 2004) was responsible for \n\nsharp increases in the pH, and values greater than 12.0 were observed. On the other \n\nhand, Rezende (2003) studied clay soils from the subgrade of two Brazilian highway \n\nexperimental roads constructed in Brasilia-DF and did not observe pH values greater \n\nthan 10.9 even after adding up to 6% hydrated lime. \n\nIn the present study, it was verified that when 2% to 4% chemical additive was \n\nadded to soils the pH value increased significantly, but more variations were observed at \n\n4% and 6% quantities and there was a slight tendency to stabilization in the pH values \n\naround 10.0, as shown in Figure 7.4. \n\nBased on the chemical equilibriums reported by Lindsay (1976), curves were \n\nconstructed that represented the conditions which under silica and aluminum \n\n\n\n \n\n 133\n\nsolubilization in water takes place, in function of the pH values. Figure 7.4 shows that in \n\nthe soils the aluminum was practically insoluble and the silica presented solubility \n\nbetween 25 and 30 cmol/L, but with the addition of 6% chemical additive the \n\nsolubilities of silica and aluminum raised to, respectively, 65 and 50 cmol/L in soils 1 \n\nand 2. In the case of soil 3, when the pH reached 10.0, silica presented solubility about \n\n75 cmol/L and aluminum was totally soluble. \n\n \n\n0 2 4 6\nRBI Grade 81 (%)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\npH\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\npH\n\n100 80 60 40 20 0\n\nSolubility (cmol/L)\n\nSoil 1\nSoil 2\nSoil 3\n\nSiO2\n\nAl2O3\n\n \nFigure 7.4.  pH of soils 1, 2 e 3 and its mixtures and basic curves of silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) \n\nsolubilization. \n\n7.3.2. Mineralogical characterization of soils and mixtures \n\nMost of chemical reactions between soil and chemical stabilizer are soil \n\nminerals dependent, and identification of mineral type in the soil different fractions is \n\nmandatory to soil stabilization studies to understand the process as a whole. Therefore, \n\nthe kinds of minerals present after the soil stabilization can become a good tool for \n\ndiagnosis on the soil behavior, which could complement the studies involving the \n\nphysical and chemical characteristics of the final product after stabilization. \n\n\n\n \n\n 134\n\nFigures 7.5 and 7.6 show data from XRD (X-ray diffraction) analyses \n\nperformed on soil samples 1, 2 and 3 and theirs 7-days curing mixtures with 2%, 4% \n\nand 6% RBI Grade 81 contents. Samples were prepared using soils sand (? 53 ?m) and \n\nsilt-clay (&lt;53 ?m) fractions. Tables 7.6 and 7.7 show values of peak intensity of the \n\nminerals identified in each of the tested soils and mixtures. \n\nSand fractions for soil samples 1, 2 e 3 and their admixtures are very similar \n\nand present, essentially, quartz that was identified by peaks corresponding to d\u2019s \n\n(atomic interplanar distance) 0.43, 0.33, 0.25 and 0.23 nm (GRIM, 1968; MOORE and \n\nREYNOLDS JR., 1989). In the sand fraction of soil 3 and its mixtures it was identified \n\nK-feldspars due to peaks obtained at 0.32 nm (GRIM, 1968; MOORE and REYNOLDS \n\nJR., 1989). Additionally to quartz and feldspar, also were detected peaks that allowed to \n\nidentify kaolinite (0.72 and 0.36 nm) in the sand fractions of soils 2 and 3 and their \n\nadmixtures. The presence of kaolinite in these samples can be associated to the \n\npseudomorphs inherited from the weathering of feldspar or muscovite that are \n\ncommonly found in these soils, as related by Pinto et al. (1972). The Figure 7.7 presents \n\nan example of the kaolinite in mica pseudomorphics forms found in soils 2 and 3. From \n\nthe data presented in Figure 7.5 and Table 7.6, it can be seen that there was a \n\nprogressive decrease in the intensity of the peaks from quartz and feldspars detected in \n\n? 53 ?m fraction at the same time that there was an increase in the chemical stabilizer \n\ncontent, showing that stabilization process was destroying part of these minerals \n\nthrough of the short- and medium-term chemical reactions that have been developed. \n\nThe XRD patterns presented in Figure 7.6 show the silt-clay fraction of all soil \n\nsamples and their mixtures. They show that kaolinite, quartz and goethite, identified by \n\ntheir peaks of d\u2019s equal to 0.72, 0.33 and 0.42 nm, respectively, appeared in all \n\n&lt;0.53 ?m fractions of soil samples and its mixtures. In samples from soils 1 and 2 and \n\nits mixtures was detected gibbsite (d = 0.49 nm). From peaks at positions corresponding \n\nto d = 1.00 nm and d = 0.50 nm it was possible to determine the presence of mica in soil \n\nsamples 2 and 3 and their mixtures. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 135\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\n2-Theta (degrees) Cok?\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n)\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n)\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n)\n\nSoil 1\n\nSoil 2\n\nSoil 3\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nQz\nQz\n\nQz\n\nQz Qz\n\nQz Qz Qz\n\nQz\n\nKa Ka\n\nKa Ka Qz\nRa\n\nFd\nQz\n\nQz\nQz Qz\n\n \nFigure 7.5.

Image obtained by secondary electrons signs produced in SEM of one kaolinite in mica \n\npseudomorphics forms flake present in soil 3 sample. \n\n \nFrom the analyses of the XRD patterns presented in Figures 7.5 and 7.6, it can \n\nbe observed that when the chemical stabilizer was added new minerals phases were \n\nformed and they were identified. In the silt-clay fraction of mixtures from soil samples 1 \n\nand 2 it was noticed the presence of portlandite which is a calcium hydroxide \n\n(d = 0.26 nm). Rankinite, calcium silicate, was identified by its peaks positions \n\ncorresponding to a d = 0.30 nm (EADES and GRIM, 1960; EADES et al., 1962) and it \n\nwas found in most of the mixtures, exception in the ? 53 ?m fraction of mixtures from \n\nsoil samples 1 and 2 (Figure 7.5). Intense and well defined peaks showed that the \n\nmixtures, after seven days cure time, showed the formation of a significant amount of \n\ncalcium silicate, mainly in the finer fractions. It was also observed that with the \n\nincreasing of chemical additive contents, the peaks for rankinite also increased \n\nindicating a larger formation of cementing compounds associated to the 6% content of \n\nRBI Grade 81. \n\nThe rankinite, calcium silicate, is a typical product of hydration reactions of the \n\ntricalcium silicate (C3S or 3CaOSiO2) portland cement (NOBLE, 1967; PETRUCCI, \n\n1998) and from pozzolanic reactions between silica (SiO2) and calcium oxide (CaO) in \n\nsoil-lime mixtures (EADES and GRIM, 1960; EADES et al., 1962; SRINIVASAN, \n\n1967; GUIMAR\u00c3ES, 1971; TRB, 1976; CHAUVEL and N\u00d3BREGA, 1980; LIMA, \n\n1981; CARVALHO et al., 1981). The portlandite [Ca(OH)2] is a mineral phase present \n\nin the RBI Grade 81 (Figure 7.8), which indicates that in soil samples 1 and 2 the \n\nreactions between this mineral and the soil minerals didn\u2019t occur completely, being \n\nnecessary a long-term to produce all the reactions. These observations are corroborated \n\n\n\n \n\n 138\n\nby the data presented by Trindade et al. (2006a, 2006b, 2006c), who, when studying the \n\neffect of the RBI Grade 81 addition in the mechanical properties of soils 1, 2 and 3, \n\nverified that the higher increases in CBR, unconfined compressive strength, tensile \n\nstrength and shear strength were associated to soil 3. \n\nTable 7.6.

This reinforces the idea that the chemical stabilization process was \n\nresponsible by consumption part of soil minerals through of the chemical reactions with \n\nRBI Grade 81. This hypothesis also presented by Eades et al. (1962), in soil-lime \n\nstabilization case, and Noble (1967), in a soil-cement stabilization study, which \n\nassociated the decreasing in peak intensities of soil minerals to consumption of these \n\nminerals, principally the aluminosilicates, though of reactions with constituents of \n\nchemical stabilizers studied. \n\n \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\n2-Theta (degrees) Cok?\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n) Ba\n\nBa\n\nPo\n\nBa\n\nBa\n\nPo\nBa\n\nBa\n\nBa\n\nBa\nBa\n\nBa\nPo Ba\n\n \nFigure 7.8.

Microstructural characterization of soils and mixtures \n\nIn stabilization studies of tropical soils, although there are many data of interest \n\non geotechnical properties of these materials, there is very little information at the \n\nmicroscopic level, including aspects such as structural reorganization, compaction and \n\nparticle cementing, which could offer interesting input for the study of the technical \n\nperformance of the mixtures. Among the methods available for this purpose, scanning \n\nelectronic microscopy has been much used to study the microstructure of compacted \n\nand chemically stabilized soils, because, according to Pessoa (2004), both compaction \n\n\n\n \n\n 140\n\nand cationic exchanges and chemical reactions are capable of causing structural \n\nrearrangements. \n\nIn the scanning electronic microscope (SEM) an electron beam accelerated by \n\nan electric field is directed, through a vacuum of 1.33x10-6 kPa, to the surface of the \n\nsample to be observed. As the result of the interaction of the electrons beam with the \n\nsample surface, there is the emission of a series of radiations, including secondary \n\nelectrons, backscattered electrons, X-rays, Auger electrons, and photons. When \n\ncorrectly captured, these radiations give characteristic data on the sample analyzed, \n\nincluding surface topography, composition and crystallography. \n\nIn scanning electronic microscopy, the signals of greatest interest for image \n\nformation are the secondary and backscattered electrons. As the primary electron beam \n\nscans the sample, these signals are modified according to variations in the surface. The \n\nsecondary electrons supply images of the sample surface topography and obtain the \n\nhigh-resolution images, while the backscattered electrons give an image characteristic \n\nof the variation of the components due to their differences in anatomic densities, where \n\nthe elements with greater densities present greater brilliance. Depending on the material \n\nanalyzed, the magnification can reach 900,000 times, but for the analysis of materials \n\ncommonly used in civil construction, the maximum increase used is 10,000 times. \n\nInitially, the microstructure was characterized from an analysis of the \n\nsecondary electron images obtained in SEM. Samples from soils 1, 2 and 3 and their \n\nmixtures with 6% chemical additive compacted under the optimum conditions (wopt and \n\n?dmax) at the standard and modified Proctor test were analyzed and the images are \n\nshown, respectively, in Figures 7.9 and 7.10. \n\nIt was observed from the sets of images presented in these figures that the \n\nvolume of soil 1 was taken up predominantly by plasma that formed a continuous phase \n\nand in some cases, was presented in the form of spherical micro-aggregates joined \n\ntogether. These micro-aggregates were formed by a very fine particles, randomly \n\nplaced, formed by assemblies of kaolinite and gibbsite minerals wrapped and cemented \n\nby iron oxyhydroxides responsible for the stability of their organization. On the other \n\nhand, it was observed that the predominance of the plasma compared to the skeleton \n\ngreatly decreased in soils 2 and 3, and in this last material there were 100 to 500 ?m \n\nquartz grains with little, or practically no, quantity of fine material filling the gaps. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 141\n\n \nFigure 7.9.  Compacted samples at standard Proctor effort images obtained by secondary electrons signs \n\nproduced in SEM: (a), (c) and (e), respectively, soils 1, 2 and 3; (b), (d) and (f), \nrespectively, soils 1, 2 and 3 with 6% of chemical stabilizer. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 142\n\n \nFigure 7.10.  Compacted samples at modified Proctor effort images obtained by secondary electrons \n\nsigns produced in SEM: (a), (c) and (e), respectively, soils 1, 2 and 3; (b), (d) and (f), \nrespectively, soils 1, 2 and 3 with 6% of chemical stabilizer. \n\n \nThe effects of the increase in the compaction effort, from the standard Proctor \n\ntest to the modified Proctor test, were clearly visible in soils 1, 2 and 3. Figures 7.9 and \n\n7.10 show that the quartz grains, present in large quantities in soils 2 and 3, were broken \n\n\n\n \n\n 143\n\nafter the increase in compaction effort, forming finer and less porous materials. In soil \n\n1, it was observed that after the increase in compaction effort very fine crack gaps arose \n\n(0.1 to 10 ?m), close to each other and placed perpendicularly to the compaction axle. \n\nFigures 7.9a and 7.10a show that these cracks were limited by a paler colored clay film, \n\ncalled stress cutan, according to terminology adopted by Brewer (1976). According to \n\nCarvalho et al. (1981), the application of a great compaction effort is not always the best \n\ntreatment to attain high mechanical strength, and it can lead to the complete destruction \n\nof the microstructure of the material, that is sometimes naturally stable, as in the case of \n\nthe latosols. \n\nRegarding the microstructure of the stabilized soils, Figures 7.9 and 7.10 show \n\nthat the chemical additive used accounted for the formation of cementation nuclei \n\namong the soil micro-aggregates. These nuclei were more obvious in the soil 3 mixtures \n\n(Figures 9f and 10f), where there seems to have been SiO2 and Al2O3 solubilization, \n\nforming a gel (calcium silicate and/or aluminates) that, after consolidation, cemented \n\nthe surrounding particles, conglomerating them (EADES and GRIM, 1960; EADES et \n\nal., 1962; NOBLE, 1967). In the soil 1 mixtures the addition of the additive conserved \n\nthe continuous microstructure (Figures 9b and 10b), resulting from the coalescence of \n\nthe micro-aggregates; however it prevented the formation of plasma orientations and \n\nempty cracks, responsible for the lamellation of soil 1 without treatment after applying \n\nthe high compacting effort, as was the case of the use of the modified Proctor test. \n\nThe analysis of the microstructure of the material compacted after adding the \n\nchemical additive also explained the results of the grain size distribution analyses \n\npresented in item 7.3.1, where the stabilized soils presented a greater quantity of sand \n\ncompared to the untreated soils. Figures 7.9 and 7.10 show that after soil stabilization \n\nthe micro-aggregates linked by the cementing nuclei performed as highly stable grains, \n\ncapable of resisting all the processes used in the grain size distribution test together to \n\ndisperse the soil particles. \n\nIn addition to SEM analysis, the microstructure of soil samples 1, 2 and 3 and \n\nof theirs admixtures with 6% of RBI Grade 81 were described using optical microscopy \n\n(OM) performed in specimens compacted at the modified Proctor compaction effort. \n\nOptical microscopy is rarely used in soil mechanics studies in Brazil and elsewhere, \n\nalthough it provides one of the simplest and less expensive techniques to study the \n\ndevelopment of microstructures of soil mixtures, reaching resolutions down to 200 ?m. \n\n\n\n \n\n 144\n\nFigure 7.11a shows that compaction of soil 1 created a clear tendency to \n\npacking and virtual coalescence of the ovoidal micro-aggregates, welded face-to-face, \n\nturning the soil mass in a higher cohesive structure and forming a typical structure \n\nobserved in compacted kaolinite latosols (SCHAEFER, 2001). Color was mainly red-\n\ndark, different from the yellowish-red color observed in undisturbed soil samples, as \n\nreported by Azevedo (1999). The quartz grains in soil 1 were less abundant than the \n\nmicro-aggregates, with grain size ranging from 0.05 to 2 mm and, usually, with \n\nsubangular to angular shapes and not oriented. In some cases compaction resulted in a \n\nbreaking or fracturing of quartz, however most grains were unaffected. Also, the \n\ncompaction effort created a fissured structure along the lines of particle weaknesses, \n\nfilled by fine interstitial plasma without apparent orientation. \n\nSimilarly to the observed in SEM images, the addition of 6% of chemical \n\nstabilizer to soil 1 produced significant reduction of its fissure formation pattern \n\n(Figure 7.11b), and all remaining voids were filled by a fine yellowish-red material. \n\nThis material was probably a mixture of the partially solubilized oxides in high pH \n\nresulting from the stabilizer addition. \n\nSoils 2 and 3 present an organization of plasma-skeleton of the granoic type, \n\nexhibit small portions with agglomeroplasmatic type, in which no clay aggregates occur \n\n(Figures 7.11c and 7.11e). The nodules are common and typically pseudomorphic, \n\nshowing subrounded smoothed grain, without fracturing and lacking orientation. \n\nStructural elements are linked through clay bridges or are embedded in the scarce \n\nplasma. In these soils, compaction led to an extreme reduction of structural voids, \n\nmainly presenting small channels and chambers and, less commonly, in the form of \n\npacking voids. The quartz grains are dominant in soils 2 and 3. In the case of the soil 2, \n\nthe grains are small, subrounded to subangular, with average size of 0.2 mm \n\n(Figure 7.11c). On the other hand, quartz and feldspar grains in soil 3 are considerably \n\nlarger, with average size of 0.5 mm, with a considerable amount of quartz grains bigger \n\nthan 1 mm (Figure 7.11e). These showed little fracturing and no evidence of corroded \n\nsurfaces. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 145\n\n \nFigure 7.11.  Compacted samples at modified Proctor effort images obtained by OM: (a), (c) and (e), \n\nrespectively, soils 1, 2 and 3; (b), (d) and (f), respectively, soils 1, 2 and 3 with 6% of \nchemical stabilizer. \n\n \nUndisturbed samples of soils 2 and 3 present kaolinite pseudomorphs after \n\nmica dispersed in the soils masses, as described by Azevedo (1999). According to this \n\n\n\n \n\n 146\n\nauthor, compaction effort promoted repacking and reorientation of these pseudomorphs \n\nforming horizontal lines parallel to the specimen\u2019s surface, and normal to the direction \n\nof the applied compaction effort. \n\nRegarding the mixtures of soils 2 and 3 stabilized with 6% of RBI Grade 81, \n\nthe images presented in Figures 7.11d and 7.11f are consistent with SEM observations. \n\nMainly in soil 3, it was observed that quartz and feldspar grains were mostly destroyed \n\nand solubilized, and the few remaining grains became fractured after the soil \n\nstabilization process. The solubilized material formed a sort of cementing gel that \n\ninvolved the micro-aggregates, pseudomorphs and remaining grains, forming a \n\nstructurally dense soil mass, highly resistant. \n\nIn the soil 3 mixture it was also possible to identify the formation of a red to \n\nyellow cementing material (Figure 7.11f) that is, probably, constituted by the same \n\nmaterial that filled out the fine crack gaps of soil 1 after its chemical stabilization. \n\nAlthough not having observed through the analyses of XRD presented in Figures 7.5 \n\nand 7.6 the formation of others minerals besides the rankinite (3CaO.2SiO2), it is \n\nbelieved that the yellow to red cementing material is formed starting from the reaction \n\nof the calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] present in RBI Grade 81 (Figure 7.8) together with \n\nthe iron and aluminum oxides (respectively, Fe2O3 and Al2O3) present in the soils, \n\ncreating the 4CaO.Al2O3.Fe2O3, also known as the C4F commonly found in the \n\nconstitution of the Portland cements. \n\nTo complement the results of the present study, a specific study was directed to \n\nthe qualitative and semiquantitative determination of the presence of chemical elements \n\nin the soils and in their mixtures using the microanalysis technique. \n\nThe microanalysis is one of the most important instruments for the chemical \n\nanalysis of organic and inorganic materials. Through the identification of the X-ray \n\nemitted by the sample, when of the interaction with the electrons beam, it is possible to \n\ndetermine the composition of areas over 1 \u00b5m of diameter. It is a non-destructive \n\ntechnique that can determine amounts from 0.1% of present elements in the sample, \n\nsince Z > 11 in the case of EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer) and Z > 4 in the \n\ncase of WDS (wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometer). It should be pointed out that \n\nin the EDS technique presence of the carbon element can be related to the coating of the \n\ncarbon conductor film applied over the sample before testing. In the present research it \n\n\n\n \n\n 147\n\nwas used a EDS probe and Figures 7.12 and 7.13 show data of soils 1, 2 and 3 and of \n\ntheirs mixtures with 6% of RBI Grade 81. \n\n \n\n0\n\n400\n\n800\n\n1200\n\n1600\n\n2000\nIn\n\nte\nns\n\nity\n (\n\nco\nun\n\nts\n)\n\nElements\nC\nO\nAl\nSi\nTi\nFe\n\nMean concentration (%)\n7.76\n\n63.76\n13.58\n10.84\n0.23\n3.83\n\n0\n\n400\n\n800\n\n1200\n\n1600\n\n2000\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n)\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nEnergy (keV)\n\n8\n0\n\n400\n\n800\n\n1200\n\n1600\n\n2000\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n (\nco\n\nun\nts\n\n)\n\nC\n-K\n\n?\nO\n\n-K\n?

However, other elements were also detected in \n\nsmaller amounts, as it is the case of Na, Mg, K and Ti. It should be referred that the \n\nelements Na and K were just found in the soils 2 and 3 (Figures 7.12b and 7.12c) being \n\nassociated to the K-feldspar and mica mineral groups as illustrated in Figures 7.5 and \n\n7.6. The largest amount of Fe was determined in soil 1 (Figure 7.12a), a yellowish-red \n\nlatosol with reasonable goethite presence (Figure 7.6). Great amounts of Al and Si were \n\nencountered, probably, associated to the minerals kaolinite and quartz which are the \n\nmost abundant in the three analyzed soils. \n\nFrom the ESD spectrums illustrated in Figure 7.13, it was also verified the \n\nmain elements found in the mixtures of the soils 1, 2 and 3 with 6% of RBI Grade 81 \n\nthat most important elements present are Al, Si, Ca and S. But Mg, P, K, Mn, Ti and Fe \n\nwere also detected in smaller amounts. \n\nAlso, microchemical analysis were performed to quantify the cementation \n\nprocess created by addition of 6% of stabilizer to the soil 1, furnishing semiquantitatives \n\nmicrochemical charts of this soil and its mixture (Figure 7.14). \n\nThe data presented in Figure 7.14c are in agreement with those from the \n\nmicroanalysis (Figure 7.12a), and show that the soil 1 is constituted basically by Si, Al \n\nand Fe oxides. From the data presented in Figure 7.14d it can be observed that in the \n\nmixture of the soil 1 with 6% of RBI Grade 81are detected, also, Ca and S that are \n\nconcentrated in the areas of assembly of crystals. In these areas, together with the Ca \n\nand S, it is verified presence of an expressive amount of O, Al and Si. \n\nThe micro-aggregates in the form of small sticks presented in Figure 7.14b and \n\n7.14d, probably, are constituted by bassanite or gypsum [CaSO4(0.5H2O)], which is also \n\na material present in the RBI Grade 81 (Figure 7.8). Other minerals that, probably, were \n\nformed in the stabilization process of soil 1 were the calcium, aluminum and iron \n\nsilicates and the sulfoaluminate, that is a solid element that lodges in the pores of the \n\nsoil mass turning them more compact, since there is not excess of calcium oxide \n\ndissolved in the interstitial water that, in contact with the sulfoaluminate, can create the \n\nettringite (hydrated calcium aluminum sulfate hydroxide), which is an extremely \n\nexpansible and very common mineral in the reactions between soils rich in sulfates with \n\nthe Portland cements (ROLLINGS et al., 1999). \n\n\n\n \n\n 150\n\n \nFigure 7.13.

Conclusions \n\n\u2022 The chemical additive altered the grain size distribution of the soils. Fine \nparticles were coalesced forming larger flakes; with tend to be granular with \n\nincreasing additive content. These changes in grain size distribution are \n\nillustrated at SEM scale (secondary electron images presented in Figs. 7.9 \n\nand 7.10) showing the formation of a granular microstructure by welding of \n\nsmaller particles with a cementing agent. \n\n\u2022 Increasing chemical additive content generally caused slight increases in the \nPL values and decreases in the LL and PI values, as well produced small \n\nalterations in the grain unit weight of all studied soils. \n\n\u2022 The chemical additive was responsible for significant increase in pH and \nCEC, with sharp reductions in the potential acidity of the soils. The pH of \n\nthe mixtures reached values of 10.0, forming greater silica and aluminum \n\nsolublization in the soil, resulting in the formation of calcium silicates and \n\naluminates. These silicates are the compounds responsible for the \n\nmechanical strength and durability of concrete from Portland cement \n\n(EADES et al., 1962). It is postulated that the inter-particle cementing \n\nmatrix formed after stabilization with RBI Grade 81 is very strong and \n\nstable, and maybe be very durable. \n\n\u2022 The OM and SEM analyses showed that increasing compaction effort \naccounted for the appearance of fractures along the surfaces, unconnected \n\ncracking voids in the clayey plasma (soil 1) and breaking of the quartz \n\ngrains (soils 2 and 3). However, the latter effect was minimized with the \n\naddition of the chemical additive to the soils that caused the formation of \n\nhighly visible cementing nuclei, especially in the soil 3 mixtures. \n\n\u2022 Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) analyses indicated that \ncontents of Si and Al oxides in soils decrease after chemical stabilization, \n\nprobably by solubilization of these oxides and Ca silicates and aluminates \n\nformation during hydration and/or pozzolanic reactions of chemical \n\nstabilizer with soils. \n\n\n\n \n\n 152\n\n\u2022 With reference to mineralogy, the chemical stabilizer addition resulted in \npeak reduction of all clay minerals and the formation of rankinite, a Ca-\n\nsilicate in a well-crystalline form, easily identified by X-ray diffraction, \n\nstrengthening the conclusions gotten from the EDS analyses. \n\nReferences \n\nAMERICAN SOCIETY FOR TESTING AND MATERIALS.
