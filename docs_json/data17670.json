This \nmicroscopic model is based on a network approach for porous medium and is used to study the \ndrying behavior inside the porous medium at the pore level during the drying process. The driving \nforce for liquid transfer is the capillary force and the mass transfer in gaseous phase is the vapor \ndifiiision. The Kelvin effect is considered in this model, i.e., the gas-liquid interface is treated as a \nmeniscus. The gravity force is neglected because the size o f the pores and throats in network are \nlarge enough (> 20 jim). Drying process is simulated using this model on various 100x20 square \nnetworks which contain 2000 pores and 4000 throats. The liquid used is alcohol. The drying \nprocess is assumed to be isothermal.\n\nThe phase distribution effect, the Kelvin effect and the influence o f the velocity of the \nexternal flow upon the drying process are investigated. Three distinct regions are observed in all \nof the simulation results, i.e., dry region, unsaturated region and saturated region. The \nevaporating front region (unsaturated region) is relatively stable, although it is far from a flat \nsurface. Many temporary liquid clusters appear in the unsaturated region and the cluster number \nincreases with the distance o f the evaporating front from the interface.\n\nIt is found that the phase distribution (moisture heterogeneities) has a great influence on \nthe drying rate through the formation of funicular drying zones, specially at the beginning of the \ndrying process. This influence decreases with the receding o f the evaporating front from the \ninterface. The drying process becomes vapor difiiision dominated after the interface is totally \ndried and the influence o f phase distribution heterogeneities decrease. The evaporation- \ncondensation mechanism is observed in the simulation, which confirmed the existence of such \nprocess in the drying o f capillary porous medium.\n\n\n\nA b stra ct Hi\n\nConcerning to the microscopic model, it is found that Kelvin effect makes a very small \ndifference in terms of the difltusion driving force caused by the curvature. The Kelvin effect, \nhowever, is very important from the pomt of view of the evaporation-condensation mechanism. \nThe appearance of condensing clusters changes the drying path due to the liquid removing \nprocess, altering the phase distribution during the drying process. This influence is affected by the \nnetwork formation.\n\nThe incoming velocity of the external flow over the interface o f the porous medium has \ninfluence on the local mass fluxes as would be expected. But it is significant only while the \ninterface is totally or partially wetted. This influence decreases with the receding evaporating \nfi-ont. Concerning the stability o f the evaporating fi-ont, it seems that this is only important at the \nbeginning o f the drying period.\n\n\n\nResumo iv\n\nR e s u m o\n\nUm modelo de secagem microsc\u00f3pico para o meio poroso capilar \u00e9 apresentado nesta \ntese. Este modelo microsc\u00f3pico \u00e9 baseado em uma abordagem de rede para o meio poroso e \u00e9 \nusado para estudar o comportamento da secagem no interior do meio poroso durante o processo \nde secagem em escala dos poros. A for\u00e7a motora para o transporte do l\u00edquido \u00e9 a for\u00e7a capilar e a \ntransfer\u00eancia de massa na fase gasosa \u00e9 a difus\u00e3o de vapor. O efeito Kelvin \u00e9 considerado neste \nmodelo, ou seja, a interface g\u00e1s-l\u00edquido \u00e9 tratada como um menisco. A for\u00e7a gravitacional \u00e9 \nignorada pois os tamanhos dos poros e gargantas da rede s\u00e3o relativamente grandes (> 20 [xm). O \nprocesso de secagem \u00e9 simulado usando este modelo em v\u00e1rias redes quadradas 100x20, \ncontendo 2000 poros e 4000 gargantas. O l\u00edquido \u00e9 \u00e1lcool e o processo de secagem \u00e9 assumido \nisot\u00e9rmico.\n\nO efeito de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da fase l\u00edquida, o efeito Kelvin e a influ\u00eancia da velocidade do \nescoamento externo sobre o processo de secagem s\u00e3o investigados. Tr\u00eas regi\u00f5es distintas s\u00e3o \nobservadas em todas as snnula\u00e7\u00f5es, isto \u00e9, regi\u00e3o seca, regi\u00e3o n\u00e3o saturada e regi\u00e3o saturada. A \nfrente de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o (regi\u00e3o n\u00e3o saturada) \u00e9 relativamente est\u00e1vel, mesmo que a superf\u00edcie seja \nhregular. Muitas ilhas isoladas tempor\u00e1rias surgem na regi\u00e3o n\u00e3o saturada e o n\u00famero dessas ilhas \naumenta com a dist\u00e2ncia da frente de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o da interface.\n\nConstatou-se que a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da fase l\u00edquida (heterogeneidade da umidade) tem uma \ngrande influ\u00eancia sobre a taxa de secagem atrav\u00e9s da forma\u00e7\u00e3o das zonas secas funiculares, \nespeciahnente no in\u00edcio do processo de secagem. Esta influ\u00eancia dimmui com o recuo da frente de \nevapora\u00e7\u00e3o da interface. O processo de secagem toma-se dominado pela difus\u00e3o de vapor ap\u00f3s a \nsecagem total da interface e a influ\u00eancia de heterogeneidade da umidade diminui. O mecanismo \nevapora\u00e7\u00e3o-condensa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 observado na simula\u00e7\u00e3o, influenciando o processo de secagem atrav\u00e9s \nda mudan\u00e7a do caminho da secagem.\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nNo que diz respeito ao modelo microsc\u00f3pico, o efeito Kelvin tem pouca influ\u00eancia com \nrela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 for\u00e7a motora de difiis\u00e3o, causada pela curvatura. Entretanto, esse \u00e9 muito importante do \nponto de vista do mecanismo evapora\u00e7\u00e3o-condensa\u00e7\u00e3o. O surgimento de ilhas isoladas em \nprocesso de condensa\u00e7\u00e3o muda o caminho da secagem devido ao processo de retirada do l\u00edquido, \nalterando a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da fase l\u00edquida durante o processo de secagem. Essa influ\u00eancia \u00e9 afetada \npela distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de poros da rede.\n\nA vaz\u00e3o do escoamento externo tem uma influ\u00eancia na taxa de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o local, como \nera de se esperar. Entretanto, isso \u00e9 importante apenas enquanto a interface est\u00e1 total ou \nparcialmente molhada. Esta influ\u00eancia diminui com o recuo da frente de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o no interior do \nmeio poroso. A estabilidade da frente de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o parece ser importante somente no in\u00edcio da \nsecagem.\n\n\n\nL ist o f  Contents y,\n\nL i s t  o f  C o n t e n t s\n\nA c k n o w l e d g m e n

The \nconvective drying of porous materials and the thermal insulation o f buildings are two examples. \nEspecially, drying is an essential operation unit in the industrial production and one of the most \nenergy-intensive processes in industry. There is hardly a product in the processing industries that \ndoes not have to be dried one or more times during the course of its production. Sometimes, the \ndrying operation cost can affect the economics of all process. To improve process performance \nand energy utilization, new drying technologies have been studied and applied, such as fluidized \nand spouting bed drying, freeze drying, spray drying and dielectrically-assisted convective drying, \nwith emphasis on increasing the heat and mass transfer area and the transfer coefBcient at the \ninterface between external flow and porous material. Although these drying technologies have \nbeen used in industry production, the drying model for prediction of the processes are generally \nempirical or semi-empirical. From the theoretical point of view, even the simplest situation, such \nas the convective drying of a bed of glass beads at room temperature is still a challenging problem \nfor the modelers. One of the reasons which precludes the existence o f a general model for the \nprediction of drying of porous material is the great variety of the materials encountered in practice \nand the geometric complexity of their structures. Porous media include a lot o f materials which \nare encountered literally everywhere in everyday Ufe. A material or a structure must pass at least \none of the following two tests in order to qualify as a porous medium (Dullien, 1979).\n\n(1) It must contain spaces, so-called pores or voids, free of solids, imbedded in the solid or \nsemisolid matrix. The pores usually contain some fluid, such as air, water, oil, etc., or a mixture of \ndifferent fluids.\n\n(2) It must be permeable to a variety of fluids, i.e., fluids should be able to penetrate \nthrough one face of a septum made of the material and emerge on the other side.\n\n\n\nC hapter 1 G eneral Introduction\n\nCapillary flow\nEvaporation-\nCondensation Vapor flow\n\nFig. 1-1 Moisture movement at various stages in the \ndrying of a porous material (from Bories, 1991)\n\nWhen a sample of wet porous material dries under constant external conditions, that is, \ntemperature, humidity and air-velocity held constant during the drying process, four phases of \nmoisture movement within the material may be distinguished (Fig. 1-1). In the first phase, the \nsample is saturated with the liquid, the moisture flows as liquid towards the interface under a \nhydraulic gradient due to the difference of capillary force. There is no vapor or air inside the \nporous medium, or it can be neglected. In the second phase, a part of the sample has been dried, \nthe moisture has withdraw from the waist of the pores, and moisture can migrate either by \ncreeping along the capillary walls or by successive evaporation and condensation between liquid \nbridges (Fig. 1-2). The evaporation-condensation mechanism through liquid bridges works as \nfollowing.\n\nFig. 1-2 A liquid bridge at a narrow throat\n\nInitially, the menisci curvature at the two sides of the liquid bridge are equal due to the \nthermodynamic equilibrium condition (indicated by solid line). The vapor flows in the direction\n\n\n\nC hapter I G eneral Introduction\n\nindicated by the arrow due to the gradient of partial pressure caused by the difference of menisci \ncurvatures and the temperature. Vapor condenses at the surface of meniscus A, resulting in a \ndecreasing of the meniscus curvature (plotted by dashed line) and the unequilibrium of capillary \nforce between two sides. The meniscus B (soUd line) has a higher curvature than meniscus A. This \ncurvature difference of menisci at the two end sides of the liquid bridge resuhs in a pressure \ndifference inside the liquid phase, i.e., a gradient of hydraulic pressure from A to B is established. \nAs a consequence, liquid flows from high to low pressure and a new equilibrium tends to establish \nat the two end sides of the liquid bridge (dashed line). If the vapor pressure at the side B is lower \nthan that of side A, the liquid at meniscus B will evaporate causing an increasing in curvature. \nVapor will condense on side A and evaporate on side B, and liquid is transported through the \nbridge. The liquid bridge can last if the condensation rate at one side is equal to the evaporation \nrate at the other side. Of course, the liquid bridge could have two evaporating or condensing \nmenisci at its both sides depending on the moisture content adjacent to the menisci. If the two \nmenisci are evaporating, the liquid bridge will become smaller and smaller until it disappears. On \nthe other hand, if the two menisci are condensing, the liquid bridge will become bigger and bigger \nuntil its menisci reach the throat edges.\n\nOn a latter drying stage, the liquid bridges evaporate entirely leaving only adsorbed \nmoisture behind. During this last phase, moisture moves by unhindered diffusion. The final stage \no f the porous medium is one of desorption-adsorption during which any moisture evaporated is \ncondensed and the body is in hygrothermal equilibrium with its environment.\n\nThe internal moisture flow may be affected by several factors depending on the structure \nof the solid matrix, the type o f moisture bonding, the moisture content, temperature and pressure \nin the capillaries, etc. The main mechanisms which cause internal moisture flow are:\n\n(1) Capillary forces\n(2) DifRision due to concentration difference\n(3) Phase change (evaporation - condensation mechanisms taking place in the pores)\n(4) Surface diffusion of moisture on adsorbed liquid layer at the capillary surface\n(5) Difference in total pressure\n(6) Gravity\n(7) Thermo-diffiision\n\nSeveral of these mechanisms dominate at a given time during drying, and their importance \nare not the same for different porous materials. It depends on many factors such as material \ncomposition, period of drying, pore size etc. No matter which mechanism controls the drying\n\n\n\nC h apter I G eneral Introduction\n\nbehavior, the drying rate curve is almost common to all materials (Fig. 1-3). A general drying \nprocess wUl now be described (Peishi and David, 1989, Bories, 1991)\n\nIf the initial moisture content o f the porous medium is high enough, almost all material \nsurface is covered by a liquid fihn and the internal moisture transfer is mainly attributable to \ncapillary flow o f free liquid. The drying rate is then generally controlled by the convective heat \nand mass transfer coefficient of the external flow. If the external conditions are constant, the \ndrying rate is constant in this period. It is also known that if all the heat needed for evaporating \nthe liquid is supplied by the ak, the temperature of the material surface will take on a value very \nclose to the ambient wet-bulb temperature (Prata and Sparrow, 1985a, 1985b and 1988)\n\nFig. 1-3 Variation of drying rate with time\n\nAs drying proceeds, the liquid supplied to the surface by capillary forces becomes \ninsufficient to replace the liquid being evaporated. When the moisture content reaches a certain \ncritical value, discontinuous wet patches will occur at the material surface. Thus, the mass transfer \ncoefficient decreases with the surface free liquid content and the first falling rate period starts. In \nthe first falling rate period, a new energy balance will be reached at the surface, accompanied by a \nslowly rising o f the surface temperature. Free liquid still exists at the surface, the 'dry' patches still \ncontain bound liquid, and the vapor pressure at the surface is determined by the Clausius- \nClapeyron equation.\n\nWhen the surface moisture content reaches its maximum sorptive value, no free liquid \nexists at the surface. The surface temperature will rise rapidly, signaling the start of the second \nf a l l i n g  rate period, and evaporation takes place only inside the material.\n\n\n\nChapter 1 G eneral Introduction\n\nThe main difficulty in modeling the drying behavior lies in the prediction of the falling rate \nperiod which is, in fact, the essential period of drying. Such a prediction requires a rigorous and \ndetailed physical and mathematical description of internal mechanisms and boundary conditions.\n\n1 .2  L it e r a t u r e  R e v ie w\n\nThe description of heat and mass transfer is usually based on the transport equations \nresulting from the differential balance laws. To predict the mass and heat flux from a given \nmaterial requires detailed information on the surrounding velocity and temperature fields. For a \ncontinuous medium, this information is extracted from the solution of the associated microscopic \nequations subject to pertinent boundary conditions.\n\nFor porous media, these local or microscopic equations are generally still valid within the \npores. However, the geometric complexity of the pores medium precludes a general solution of \nthe detailed velocity and temperature fields.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, the continuum approaches are generally used to obtain \n'macroscopic' equations, valid at a Representative Elementary Volume (R.E.V.). In these models, \nthe porous medium is treated as a fictitious continuum medium and the variables o f interest \n(moisture contents, temperature, etc.) are not representative at the pore scale but at the scale of \nsmall volumes containing a sufficient number of pores (R.E.V.) (Bachmat and Bear, 1986). The \nmajority of these models are based on the work of Philip and de Vries (1957), Luikov (1966) and \nWhitaker (1977). The fundamental hypotheses for all macroscopic models are the continuum \napproach involving generalized Darcy's and Fick's laws and the relative permeability concept. The \nmacroscopic equations for heat and mass transfer in porous medium have the following form \n(Bories, 1991);\n\n^  = V (D Vw + DTVT)-V ( ^ K V y )  (1-1)\nd i Ps\n\n( p c ) ' 5  = V((X,- + j:p.D \u201e)V T +lp.D \u201eV w ) (1-2)\noi\n\nin which w and T denote the local moisture content and temperature in the porous medium, \nrespectively. All coefficients of equations (1-1) and (1-2) are dependent variables of moisture \ncontent and temperature and must be specifically determined for each porous medium. For more \ndetails, one can refer to Crausse (1983) or Crausse.et al. (1981).\n\n\n\nC hapter I General Introduction\n\nAs have been pointed out by Masmoudi et al. (1991), these equations have not yet been \nderived from the microscopic equations by means o f a rational approach such as, for instance, the \nvolume averaging method (Whitaker, 1977) in a completely satisfactory way. Doubt remains with \nregard to the validity of these equations from a theoretical point of view. It has been shown that \none cannot expect to describe certain two-phase flow processes in porous media according to a \ncontinuum approach because of the occurrence o f large-scale heterogeneities in the fluid \ndistribution within the porous medium. These heterogeneities are associated with the action of the \ncapillary forces in a system containing a sufficient distribution of pore size. In some cases, \nmoisture content heterogeneities could also be associated with macroscopic heterogeneities of the \nstructure (Maneval and Whitaker, 1988).\n\nSome macroscopic equations are derived from microscopic equations through volume \naveraging techniques (Slattery, 1970, Gray, 1983, Whitaker, 1986a,b, Moyne et al., 1988, Bear \nand Bensabat, 1989 and Moyne et al., 1990). These equations are assumed to be valid, on the \nR.E.V., of average volumes of microscopic quantities. The main advantage of this kind of \napproach is to provide a clear physical significance o f the macroscopic coefficients, relating \nenergy and moisture fluxes and temperatures and moisture content gradients.\n\nBories (1991) reviewed some theoretical, numerical and experimental studies published \nduring the last decade on simultaneous heat and mass transfer during the drying of capillary- \nporous bodies and concluded that despite the limitations of the theory and the underlying \nassumptions, the macroscopic model is a good tool to describe and to analyze the drying of \ncapillary-porous bodies. However, many doubts still remain regarding the macroscopic models. \nFor example:\n\n\u2022 What are the transport properties of the material in question?\n\u2022 What are the appropriate values of the convective heat and mass transfer coefficients \n\nto be used at the interface between the porous medium and the external flow?\n\u2022 What is the minimum size of the averaging volume or Representative Elementary \n\nVolume for the material and transport phenomena in question?\n\u2022 How the liquid is distributed inside the porous medium during the drying process?\n\u2022 To what extent is the heterogeneity o f liquid phase distribution?\n\u2022 To what extent is the influence o f the heterogeneity of liquid phase distribution upon \n\nthe drying process?\n\u2022 What is the importance of Kelvin effect on the drying process?\n\nIn a number of studies (Whitaker and Chow, 1983, Plumb et al., 1985), it has been found \nthat the heat and mass transfer coefficients at the interface must be allowed to vary during the\n\n\n\nChapter 1 G en eral Introduction\n\ndrying process in order to obtain satisfactory agreement between experimental and numerical \nresults. The heterogeneities of moisture content at the interface has a great influence upon heat \nand mass transfer coefficient. Traditional one-dimensional simulation is not suitable to describe \nthis phenomenon. Two-dimensional or three-dimensional simulation is needed to improve the \naccuracy of the numerical results.\n\nIn the falling rate period, the fi\u2019action of wet area decrease with decreasing interface \nmoisture content. However, the continuum approach model can not answer how the fraction of \nthe wet area varies with the interface moisture content and where is the wet and dry patches at \ninterface.\n\nFurthermore, most of the macroscopic models have a common resolution o f drying, i.e., \ninterface is the first part to be dried, then the dried region proceeds inside the porous medium. In \nother words, there is always a positive moisture gradient fi\u2019om the bottom of sample to the \ninterface; the moisture at the bottom is always higher than that at the interface. This is probably \ntrue for some o f the porous media, but not for all.\n\nLee et ai. (1992) reported some surprising phenomena in the drying of 65 [im and 120^m \nglass beads. They observed that in all cases these beads had the lowest saturation at the bottom \nand very close to the investigated drying surface. In this case sufficient suction potential is \ndeveloped to lift the entire water colunm in the packed bed towards the drying surface, resulting \nin two drying fironts; one at the top of the bed and one at the bottom. This observation is contrary \nto any of the model predictions that are available in literature. One can note fi\u2019om Lee et al. results \nthat the moisture gradient can be negative at some place and positive at other place fi-om bottom \nto surface.\n\nLee et al. also measured the pressure at the bottom of the sample for the 65|im beads. It \nwas found that the pressure dropped very quickly to 0.305 cm (vacuum) of water as the bed \nbegan to dry but after a short period rose to atmospheric. This implies that air broke through fi\u2019om \nthe surface of the bed even at high liquid saturation.\n\nIt is also well-known that strong heterogeneities in the fluid phase distribution may occur \nduring drying process (trapped clusters of fluid) (Lenormand et al., 1988). However, in its \nstandard form, the model of Philip and de Vires carmot account for the occurrence of such \nheterogeneities, which is not surprise because of the fundamental hypotheses of such kind of \nmodel -\u2014 continuum approach. One cannot expect to describe the heterogeneous phenomena by \nusing a continuum concept.\n\n\n\nChapter 1 G eneral Introduction\n\nTo answer some of the questions posed previously, percolation theory seems to be a good \nalternative. Percolation theory, developed over the last decades, is ideally suited as a conceptual \nframework for interpreting the morphology and transport properties of disordered composite \nmaterials. In several papers (Larson, 1977, Pathak, 1980 and Larson et al., 1981), it is shown that \npercolation ideas provide the basis of an unified theory of the properties o f porous media and \nfluids therein.\n\nMany transport process may be successfully idealized as transport of an abstract 'fluid' \nthrough an abstract 'medium'. Difiiision of a solute through a solvent is an example of such a \nprocess. If, as in this example, the 'fluid' (solute) is imagined to 'flow' randomly, the process is \ntermed a difiiision process. If, on the other hand, the 'fluid' flow paths are determined by the \n'medium', but the 'medium' itself is in some sense random, the process is called a percolation \nprocess. This classification, and the introduction of percolation theory, are due to Broadbent and \nHammersley (1957).\n\nIn percolation theory, the porous medium is really treated as a 'porous material', i.e., parts \nof solid and parts of pores are identified. It is almost impossible to describe the geometry of \nporous media exactly because of their complexity and to overcome this difficulty, many simple \ngeometric descriptions of porous media through percolation theory have been employed in \nprevious studies. The most used method is the network model. In this model, the pores can be \nrepresented by spheres (for 3-D representation) or cylinders (for 2-D representation) and \ncoimected by throats. The liquid and vapor can migrate firom one pore to others through the \nthroats. This approach will be discussed in more details in Chapter 2.\n\nNetwork models of pore structure were first pioneered by Fatt (1956). More recently, \npore-level physics have been combined with percolation theory concepts to predict the \nmacroscopic transport and capillary equilibrium properties o f porous medium, such as capillary \npressure curves and relative permeability curves. One of the early attempts in this direction was \nthe work of Chatzis and Dullien (1977), who applied bond percolation to regular two-dimensional \nand three-dimensional lattices in order to simulate the mercury intrusion porosimetry curves of \nsandstones. Bond-correlated site percolation in random networks was latter introduced by Chatzis \n(1980) as a more realistic model for the simulation o f immiscible displacement in sandstones. \nOther contributions applying percolation theory concepts to capillary displacement in two- and \nthree- dimensional networks include the works o f Mohanty et al. (1980), Larson et al. (1981), \nMohanty and Salter (1982), Chander et al. (1983), Wilkison and Barsony (1984), Guyon et al. \n(1984) and Yanuka et al. (1989). Network models consisting o f unit cells o f the constricted-tube \ntype, have been developed by Payatakes et al. (1973,1980). Models o f this type were used to \nstudy single-phase flow (Constantinides and Payatakes, 1989) and two phase immiscible\n\n\n\nC hapter 1 G eneral Introduction\n\ndisplacement (Dias and Payatakes, 1986) in porous media. Network models of spheres-and- \ncapillaries have been used by Lapidus et al. (1985), Conner et al. (1983), Conner and Lane (1984) \nand Tsakiroglou and Payatakes (1990) in simulations of mercury porosimetry. Most of the above \ncited studies are parametric investigations o f the effect o f model parameters on model predictions. \nThe network models can be used to predict the structure and transport properties of porous media \nwhich are used in the macroscopic model for drying of porous media (loarmidis and Chatzis, \n1993). However, few works have been done to predict the drying process of capillary porous \nmedia directly by using the network model.\n\nMasmoudi et al. (1991) used the invasion percolation theory to predict the drying of \ncapillary porous media. In their model, drying is considered as an immiscible displacement process \nat low capillary number where air and water are displacing and displaced fluid, respectively. In \nabsence o f gravity, immiscible displacement can be characterized by two dimensionless numbers, \nthe viscosity ratio M and the capillary number Ca which are defined as following,\n\n^ t-t(displacmg fluid) ^ tn(di,pi^\n\nM'CdispIaced fluid) C7\n\nwhere V and a  denote the displaced fluid average velocity and the interfacial tension, respectively. \nCa represents the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces. Depending on the values of Ca and \nM, three main flow pattern have been identified (Lenormand et al., 1988)\n\n\u2022 viscous fingering\n\u2022 capillary fingering\n\u2022 stable displacement\n\nIn the case o f drying, for air as the displacing fluid and water as the displaced one, \nM = 1.8 X 10-?  and typical value of capillary number are smaller than 10 '\". At very low capillary \nnumber, such displacement can be associated with invasion percolation as statistical model \n(Lenormand et al., 1988, Wilkison, 1984). The invasion process is entirely controlled by the \ncapillary mechanisms that take place at the microscopic scale, and the randomness due to the \ndifferent size o f pores. During the invasion process, the non-wetting fluid can only enter the throat \nassociated with the largest radius of curvature (which corresponds the smallest capillary pressure). \nInvasion percolation is thus a local model. At each step, the displacing fluid invades one pore \naccording to the size of the throats along the boundary between the two fluids within the material. \nIn the work of Masmoudi et al. (1991), the main efforts were devoted to characterizing the \ntrapped fluid clusters. The experimental results were obtained using a two-dimensional \ntransparent etched network which containmg about 10,000 ducts with seven classes o f width\n\n\n\nC hapter 1 G en eral Introduction 10\n\n(from 0.1-0 6 mm) distributed at random. It was found that liquid clusters of various size \nappeared during the drying process. The number and size of the clusters depend on the relative \nimportance o f capillary and gravity. The occurrence of clusters affects the interfacial transfer \ncoefficient. The width of the trapped cluster region tends to increase with the average distance \nfi'om the interface.\n\nPlumb and Prat (1992) developed two microscopic models for describing transport \nphenomena in capillary porous media. The first consists of a two dimensional array of square \nparticles having a log-normal size distribution. The randomly sized particles are placed on a \nCartesian grid with centers distributed uniformly resulting in a network of non-uniformly sized \npores. In the second model, the porous medium is represented using two sets of elements: pores \nand throats, located respectively at the sites and bonds o f a two-dimensional Cartesian lattice. All \nsites and pores have the same size, however, the width of the throats is selected randomly \naccording to a log-normal distribution. The prediction of liquid transport due to capillary action \nand difiiision in the vapor phase were made using both models. It was found that the prediction of \ncapillary pressure and vapor phase difiusivity agree with resuhs available in the literature \nqualitatively and that the Representative Elementary Volume for such properties is larger than \nthat traditionally accepted for other properties such as porosity and dry diffiisivity. The maximum \narray or network size used in their study was 40x40. The studies o f Plumb and Prat are \nintroductory and deals only with transport phenomena inside the porous matrix. External flow \nwas not considered in their model.\n\nIn the more recent work o f Prat (1993), an isothermal drying model of capillary porous \nmedia was presented based on a modified form of invasion percolation theory. The porous \nmedium is conceptualized as a network of pores connected by narrow throats. In addition to \ncapillary and gravity effects, evaporation at the microscopic gas-liquid interface and vapor \ndifiiision in the gases phase were taken into account. This leads to a modification of the invasion \nrules associated with invasion percolation. In this model, the trappmg cluster phenomenon was \nconsidered. Contrary to the standard invasion percolation, permanent trapping cluster does not \noccur because of the evaporation at the border of each cluster during the drying process. Some \ndrying simulations on a two-dimensional network containing 5000 ducts were carried out using \nthis drying model. The phase distribution inside the network was presented and compared \nfavorably with experimental resuhs obtained using a two-dimensional micromodel (Masmoudi and \nPrat, 1991). The Kelvin effect was not taken into account in this model, i.e., the gas-liquid \ninterface was treated as plane.\n\n\n\nC hapter 1 G eneral Introduction 11\n\n1.3  Ob j e c t iv e  o f  P r e s e n t  Wo r k\n\nThe purpose of this work is to develop a microscopic model for capillary porous media by \nusing the network approach to simulate the drying process, and to study the influence of the \nheterogeneity of the porous media from a microscopic point of view, such as liquid distribution \nheterogeneity and the trapped cluster phenomenon. The final goal of this work is to describe the \nheterogeneities of moisture at the surface and inside o f porous media, to obtain the liquid \ndistribution at each step of the drying process, and to study the influence of dry patches \nphenomenon on the mass transfer at the interface between a fluid and a capillary porous medium.\n\n\n\nC hapter 2 Problem Formulation 12\n\nC h a p t e r  2  P r o b l e m  F o r m u l a t i o n\n\n2.1 P r o b l e m  Co n f ig u r a t io n\n\nThe problem studied here focus on the convective drying of capillary porous media (Fig. \n2-1). It consists of two parts; external flow (dry air flow) and internal flow (porous media). The \nexternal flow could be considered here as a steady laminar flow with zero incidence at the \nsurface. The vapor mass fraction and velocity of the external flow are denoted by o  and U, \nrespectively. The porous medium is assumed to be saturated initially and can be represented by a \nnetwork model. The liquid in porous medium can only evaporate from the top open edge. Other \nthree edges are impermeable.\n\nFor simplicity, only the isothermal drying of non-hygroscopic capillary porous medium is \nconsidered. The terminology \"capillary porous medium\" implies that capillary effects are the main \nmechanism of internal moisture transfer in the liquid phase (Prat, 1993). In these materials, \ncontrary to the hygroscopic materials, the liquid moves through the pores and not the solid phase, \ni.e., the liquid sorption phenomena may be neglected. The mechanism for vapor transfer inside the \nporous medium is the vapor difiiision through the empty pores. There can be an adsorbed liquid \nfilm on the solid surface (Rogers and Kaviany, 1992) which is due to the van der Waals' \ndispersive forces, and is significant when the pores are very small (smaller than 1 (am). The \nsurface adsorption/desorption will not be addressed here since only pores larger than 1 nm will be \nconsidered.\n\nThe traditional approach to attack such a problem can be summarized by the following\nsteps;\n\n(i) the external flow is determined by assuming a no-slip condition at the porous surface.\n\n\n\nChapter 2 Problem  Formulation 13\n\n(ii) heat and mass transfer is obtained by coupling the equations describing transports in \nboth media by expressing continuity of temperature, mass fraction, and heat and mass normal flux \ndensities at interface.\n\nPorous\nMedium\n\nExternal Flow\n\nImpermeable\n\nFig. 2-1 Configuration of the problem\n\nConsidering that a microscopic model will be used here to describe the drying of the \nporous medium, one could understand that the traditional approach for this configuration is no \nlonger suitable. The difficulties appear both inside the porous medium, and at the interface \nbetween the external flow and the porous medium. The question is how to deal with the phase \nchange inside the porous medium. In the present model, the liquid is evaporated at the air-liquid \ninterface and then transported to the top open edge by vapor difiiision. There is an evaporating \nfront inside the porous medium and its form change continually during the drying process. It is \ndifficult to simulate the real transient process of drying because of this evaporating front inside \nthe porous medium. This will be discussed in more details in the section o f boundary conditions \nfor the porous medium.\n\nFor the convective drying of the porous medium, it was first assumed that both external \nflow and the flow inside the porous medium are in an equilibrium at each time interval of drying \nprocess, i.e., the evaporating rate at the interface is constant for each time interval. The no-slip \nboundary condition is employed at the interface between the external flow and porous medium. \nThus the external flow problem is analogous to a boundary layer problem over a flat plate. For \neach time interval, the species concentration problem is solved independent of the mass transfer in \nthe porous medium. The mass transfer in the porous medium (diffiision fluxes in empty throats \nand the evaporating rate at the evaporating front) were determined with the obtained moisture \ncontent profile at the interface. The evaporating fi\"ont inside the porous medium keeps the same\n\n\n\nC h a p te r !  Problem  Formulation 14\n\nform during this time interval. In this way, the mass transfer of the external flow and porous \nmedium is solved separately in a segregate manner. To update the moisture content field of the \nexternal flow at each time interval, the information of the mass transfer of porous medium is \npassed to the external flow. The coupling between the mass transfer of porous medium to the \nexternal flow will be discussed in more details in chapter 3.\n\n2 .2  P r o b l e m  F o r m u l a t io n\n\n2.2.1 External Flow Problem\n\nAs have been discussed before, use will be made of the continuum approach to the \nexternal flow, with the no-slip condition at the interface. For a detailed discussion of the validity \nof a no-slip condition at the porous surface, one can refer to the work o f Masmoudi and Prat \n(1991). In this respect the external flow is similar to the boundary layer problem over a flat plate. \nThis is a well studied problem, and the governing equations are given by\n\nV -U  = 0 (2-1)\n\nU-VU = - - ^  + u ^ ^  (2-2)\np 5x dy\n\n-  5^0\nU - V ( D = J ^ \u2014  (2-3)\n\nd f\n\nwhere u  = u j + u j  is the velocity vector, p is the pressure, u  is the kinematic viscosity, p is \n\ndensity, is the binary difiiision coefiicient and to is the mass fi'action o f the vapor of the \nevaporating liquid.\n\nThere is no time derivative in equations (2-2) and (2-3) because it is assumed that the \nexternal flow reaches a steady state at each time interval of drying process. The time evolution for \nthe external flow can thus be viewed as a succession of steady states.\n\n\n\nC hapter 2 Problem  Formulation 15\n\n2.2.2 Boundary Conditions for the External Flow\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface depend upon what kind of model is used for the \nporous medium. For the case of a macroscopic model, the boundary conditions are somewhat \nsimple. However, for the case of a microscopic model, different boundary conditions at the \ninterface will be required for the solid, foil throats and empty throats.\n\nThe boundary conditions for equation (2-2) are given as following,\n\nU; = 0 at the solid surface (2-4)\n\n^  (2-5)\nPAi ^\n\ndy\nUyi = --Sab at empty throats (2-6)\n\nwhere the subscript a ,  b  and i denotes the vapor, air and interface respectively. Equation (2-5) \nrepresents the vertical velocity of vapor at the interface (Prata and Sparrow, 1988). In accordance \nwith the impermeability condition, the naturally occurring diffosive flow o f air to the interface \nmust be balanced by a convective flow of air away firom the interface, this is taken care of by the \nratio p/p^i in equation (2-5), as will be discussed later in section (2.2.3.3). Equation (2-6) is Fick's \nlaw and gives the vertical velocity of the vapor at the interface between the porous media and the \nexternal flow.\n\nFor equation (2-3), the boundary conditions are,\n\n\u2022 = 0 at solid surface (2-7)d(\u00d9M\nd y\n\n\u00a9Ai = o* for full throats (2-8)\n\n= -p-? AB \u2014 \u2014 for empty throats (2-9)\nd y\n\nwhere the ca* is the vapor mass fraction at the system temperature for corresponding throat radius \nand the J is the vapor difiiision flux density within the empty throats. With given boundary \nconditions, one can solve the governing equation numerically by using the control volume method \n(Patankar, 1980), for instance.\n\n\n\nC hapter 2 Problem  Formulation 16\n\n2.2.3 Microscopic Model for Porous Medium\n\n2.2.3.1 Network M odel fo r  Porous Medium\n\nThe structure of most real porous media is too complex for an exact mathematical \ndescription. For this reason, simplified geometrical models of the porous media are usually \nemployed. Based o f such simplified models, transport process in porous media can be predicted. \nOne can refer to Dullien and Batra (1970), van Brakel (1975), and Payatakes and Dias (1984) for \nreviews o f different models based on pore network used for various classes of porous media.\n\nFig. 2-2 Some example o f lattices and pore network\n\nDifferent network models (square, hexagonal, triangular, Kagomw, cubic, and node of a \npore network, for example, Burganos and Sotirchos, 1987, Fig. 2-2) should be used to describe \nthe structure of different porous media. The geometrical structure of a packed bed o f sand, for \ninstance, is different fi'om that of a piece of wood. Therefore, a very important step is to select an \nappropriate network model for a given porous medium. To some extent, the choice of the \nnetwork is a factor that can determine the success of a microscopic model. Generally, the image \nanalysis technique should be used to study the structure of porous media. The distribution of \npores can be obtained and the appropriate network can be selected by using this technique.\n\nFor simplicity, we could consider the porous media as a network consisting of pores and \nthroats. Thus, the porous media will be treated here as a cubic (for three-dimensional) or square \n(for two-dimensional) network of spherical (or cylindrical) pores interconnected by cylindrical (or\n\n\n\nC h a p te r !  Problem  Formulation 17\n\nrectangular) throats. The distance between the centers of two adjacent pores will be held fixed. \nThe diameters o f pores and throats could be chosen randomly fi-om preselected distribution \n(Gaussian or log-normal, for instance). This makes the network model adopted here different \nfirom that o f Plumb and Prat, 1992. In their model, only the throat diameter a log-normal \ndistribution but the diameter of pores was kept the same. Where two adjacent pores are found to \nintersect during the network construction, one of them is randomly interchanged with another \npore of the network. A similar interchange is made if a throat is found to be larger than one of the \ntwo pore at its ends. One can refer to Constantinides and Payatakes (1989) for more details on \nthe computer-aided construction of the network.\n\n2.2.3.2 Liquid Transport in Porous Medium\n\nIn the present model, the driving force for liquid transport is the difference o f the capillary \npressure. For the convective drying problem treated here, the inmiiscible displacement concept is \nnot appropriate to describe the drying process because all the liquid which were taken fi-om the \nporous media is in vapor state. In other words, the liquid have to become vapor before it is \ntransported to the external flow. For the immiscible displacement process (Kaviany, 1991), there \nis no mass exchange through the air-liquid interface, and the liquid is displaced simply by the air,\ni.e., the liquid is taken fi-om the porous media in liquid state. That is the case in the work of \nMasmoudi et al. (1991) and Plumb and Prat (1992), where the drying is treated as an immiscible \ndisplacement process. The present author is in doubt about this approach.\n\nThe description of the liquid transport adopted here will now be presented. At the \nbeginning of drying, all of the pores and throats are filled with liquid, and only the throats \nadjacent to the surface are in contact with the external dry air flow. The evaporation o f liquid \ntakes place at the throats which have an air-liquid interface. As drymg proceeds, the curvature of \nmenisci of the throats adjacent to the interface decrease. When the curvature of the menisci reach \na critical value, i.e., the meniscus of the biggest throat is approximately hemispherical, its \ncurvature stops changing. As a result of evaporation, the meniscus o f the biggest throat adjacent \nto the surface recedes inwards the porous matrix, and all others menisci remain at the same \nposition because their suction potential are higher than that of the biggest throat. The liquid which \nevaporated fi-om the smaller throats are replaced by liquid fi'om bigger throats which have an air- \nliquid interface. In other words, bigger throats lose their liquid in two ways, by evaporation and \nby liquid flow caused by difference of capillary pressure. Smaller throats virtually do not lose \nliquid because they can get liquid fi'om bigger throats to replace their evaporated liquid There is a \nbalance between the rate of evaporation and liquid flux caused by difference of capillary pressure. \nThe menisci of smaller throats do not recede as long as this balance holds. For a discussion o f the\n\n\n\nC hapter 2 Problem Formulation 18\n\ninfluence of gravity and viscosity in this balance, the reader is referred to Prata and Prat, 1995. At \nthe later period of drying, the difference of capillary pressure become smaller, and liquid \nevaporated fi\u2019om small throats can not be replaced by liquid transported by difference of capillary \npressure, and the menisci of the small throats begin receding. At this moment, all o f the menisci \nrecede either because o f evaporation or liquid flow.\n\nFig. 2-3 gives a simple example o f the liquid transport in the porous medium. The menisci \nA and E are plate at the initial. Liquid evaporate fi'om both menisci A and B and their curvature \ndecrease. When their curvature reach the critical value o f meniscus A, their curvature stop \nchanging. The meniscus A recedes to the position B. The meniscus E remains at the interface \nbecause it can take the liquid fi\u2019om larger throat to replace the evaporated liquid. After throat 1 is \nempty, the meniscus recede to the position C and throat 3 still has condition to take liquid fi-om \nthroat 2 to replace its evaporated liquid. Meniscus E begin to recede inside the porous medium \nonly after the meniscus from throat 2 reaches the position D because there is no more larger fiill \nthroat from which throat 3 can take liquid. As a result o f evaporation, the menisci E and D \nchange their position in the same time until throat 3 is empty.\n\nA\n\nV A\n\nB\n\n1\ni\n\nFig. 2-3 An example o f liquid transport in porous medium\n\nAs mentioned before, the trapped liquid phenomena can occur at some period of the \ndrying process. Several liquid clusters can appear in the porous media. For each trapped liquid \ncluster, the liquid evaporated from smaller throats can only be replaced by the liquid of the \nbiggest throat of the corresponding cluster because there is no connection between trapped \nclusters.\n\n\n\nChapter 2 Problem  Formulation 19\n\nThe liquid inside the pores have priority to evaporate in each cluster as soon as one of its \nconnecting throats is empty because the pore radius is always bigger than that of its connecting \nthroats due to the basic rule in construction of networks. If one o f the pore cormecting throat is \nthe largest throat at the evaporating front, the pore has to be the biggest one after the liquid in \nthat throat was evaporated. This will be taken as a rule in the present simulation.\n\n2.2.3.3 Evaporation Rate at the Air-Liquid Interface\n\nIn the present model, liquid evaporation takes place at all pores having an air-liquid \ninterface inside the porous medium during the drying process. The evaporated vapor are \ntransported to the surface only by vapor difiiision. It should be noted that the porous medium is \nisothermal and that the liquid evaporation rate is controlled by the rate of difiiision, i.e., vapor \ntransported by difiiision have to be balanced by vapor evaporated. The balance between difiiision \nand evaporation yields (Prata and Sparrow, 1988)\n\n=  ( 2- 10)\ndy\n\nwhere is the vapor density at the air-liquid interface, Uyj is the vapor velocity, p is the mixture \ndensity, is the binary difiiision coefiicient and a  is the vapor mass fraction; subscript a  and i \ndenote vapor and interface respectively. Equation (2-10) can be rewritten as\n\n=  (2- 11)\nPAi ^\n\nEquation (2-11) will be used to calculate the evaporation rate at the interface between the \nexternal flow and the porous medium.\n\n2.2.3.4 Diffusion o f Vapor\n\nThe vapor difiiision takes place between two adjacent empty pores while the connecting \nthroat is empty. It is assumed that the vapor difiiision between empty pores can be treated as an \none-dimensional binary difiiision. Thus, the difiiision of vapor can be described by Fick's law\n\nday\nA- \n\ndy\nh = - P ^ A B - ^  (2-12)\n\n\n\nC hapter 2 Problem Formulation 20\n\nwhere, except for which is the vapor flux density, all other symbols appearing in equation (2- \n12) have been already explained and is also in the nomenclature.\n\nDififusivities of gases at low density are almost composition independent, increase with the \ntemperature, and vary inversely with pressure. In the present work, the gaseous pressure in the \nporous medium is atmospheric pressure and the temperature virtually constant. Therefore, the \nbinary diffusion coefBcient, will be assumed constant.\n\n2.2.3.5 Partial Pressure o f Vapor within the Pores\n\nDuring the drying process, the pores can have only two states: full o f liquid or empty. For \na full pore, it is not necessary to calculate the partial pressure of liquid because there is no vapor \ndiffusion through it. But for empty pores, the situation is somewhat complex because the \nconnecting fiill throats could belong to different trapping clusters. There are two possible \nsituations and the way to determine the partial pressure of the vapor for each situation is different. \nThose situations will now be discussed.\n\n1. Empty pore connecting with empty throats\n\nIn this case, the partial pressure of vapor in the pore is determined by the difiiision rate of \nadjacent throats. There is a mass balance that has to be satisfied and the vapor partial pressure can \nonly be calculated by solving the difiiision equations o f adjacent throats all together. Note that the \npartial pressure o f this pore depends upon the four adjacent pores, that is, it is not an independent \nvariable. This will be discussed later in more details.\n\n2. Empty pore connecting with more than one fiill throats\n\nThe vapor partial pressure in the pore is not uniform. Consideration is given to an empty \npore connecting with more than one fiill throats which belong to different trapping clusters. For \neach trapping cluster, the menisci radii of all throats which are on its border have to be the same, \nand is determined by the Kelvm's law. If there are difference o f menisci radii at the border o f a \ntrapping cluster, there would be difference of Kelvin force between them. This force unbalance \nwill cause liquid flow inside the trapping cluster until equilibrium is established. The menisci radii \nat the border will tend to be the same and equal to the radius o f the biggest fiill throat. In other \nwords, the partial pressure of vapor at a trapping cluster have only one value and is determined by \nthe biggest throat at the border.\n\n\n\nC hapter 2 Problem  Formulation 21\n\nFig. 2-4 Diagram showing an empty pore with three full throats; \nthe vapor partial pressure is determined by the balance between \n\nevaporating rate at interface and diffusion fluxes of empty throats\n\nThe vapor partial pressure at the menisci of the fiill throats which are cormected to the \nempty pore, thus, can have different value since they belong to different trapping clusters (Fig. 2- \n4). Kelvin's equation can then be used to determine the vapor partial pressure at the border of \neach trapping cluster. The vapor partial pressure at the center point of the empty pore (Py) can be \ncalculated by mass balance assuming an equilibrium state. One should recall Kelvin's equation,\n\nR T l n ^ = - \u2014  (2-14)\nPo rp,\n\nwhere\n\nR Universal gas constant \nT Absolute temperature of the system \no  Surface tension \nM Liquid molecular weight \nP( Liquid density \nr Radius of curvature\nPq Vapor pressure for a flat surface at temperature T \nPj Vapor pressure for a curved surface of radius r\n\n\n\nC hapter 2 Problem  Formulation 22\n\nFor simplicity, it is assumed that the contact angle is equal to zero, i.e., the meniscus \nradius is equal to the throat radius. The mass fraction o  is then calculated by using the state \nequation for ideal gases.\n\nP,V = n ,^ R T\n\nP,M,\nV ?

The vapor cannot be \ntransported through a full throat by difiiision but evaporation-condensation mechanism. The \nvapor mass fraction in empty pores are not independent variables, but are determined by the \ndiffusion fluxes o f neighbor empty throats. There is a mass balance for each empty pore that must \nbe satisfied. The number of empty pores and throats change at each time interval, and, therefore, \nthe resistance network for vapor difiiision change its form during the drying simulation.\n\nFor a square network, each pore is connected with four throats, i.e., the coordination \nnumber is four. Generally, we consider the situation sketched in Fig. 2-5. At a time interval At, \nthe vapor mass balance for pore (i,j) is given by\n\n-  (\u00ae i,jP u)'K j / At = Ih;? j -  + mf. -  m j_, (2-19)\n\nwhere O;j is the vapor mass fraction in pore (iJ), rhy is the vapor flux in vertical throat (iJ) and \n\nrhy is the vapor flux in horizontal throat (i,j).

The value of co in empty pores at each time interval are obtained by solving \nequation (2-30).\n\n\n\nC hapter 2 Problem  Formulation 25\n\n2.2.4 Boundary Conditions for the Porous Medium\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface for the external flow have already been given in \nequation (2-4)-(2-9). For the porous medium model, the boundary conditions at the interface \nbetween the external flow and the porous medium is somewhat simple. The throats adjacent to \nthe interface were considered either fiill or empty. For full throats, equation (2-11) is used to \nobtain the evaporation rate and for empty throats, equation (2-12) is used to calculate the \ndiffusion flux. The coupling between the external flow and the internal flow will be discussed in \nmore details in the next Chapter.\n\nThe situation inside the porous medium is more complex, since the problem encompasses \nphase change, that is, there is an evaporating front inside the porous medium. Different from the \nmacroscopic model, this evaporatmg front is not plane but has a complex geometric form. \nMoreover, the evaporating front changes its form and place during the drying process. At late \ndrying periods, the formation of liquid clusters complicates the situation. Clearly, one can not \nexpect to deal with the continuous change of the evaporating front during the drying simulation \nbecause it is difficult to calculate the diffusion fluxes of empty throats with a changing \nevaporating front inside the porous medium. This is the main reason that it is difficult to simulate \nthe real transient process of drying. The form of resistance network for vapor diffusion has to be \nfixed in order to have a fixed boundary condition at the evaporating front. Therefore, the \nevaporating front is assumed to be fixed during a time interval. For each new time interval At, the \nposition of the evaporating front for each cluster have to be updated to get the new resistance \nnetwork for vapor diffusion. The vapor mass fraction at the evaporating front is the saturated \nvalue corresponding to each trapped cluster, i.e., the mass fraction at the border of one trapped \ncluster are the same and is determined by the radium of the biggest throat at its border.\n\n\n\nChapter 3 Solution M ethodology 26\n\nC h a p t e r  3  S o l u t i o n  M e t h o d o l o g y\n\nAfter the formulation of the external flow problem, the introduction of the boundary \nconditions and the discussion of the microscopic model for porous medium explored in last \nchapter, the next step is to solve the governing equations numerically and to develop a simulator \nfor the porous medium according to the microscopic model described foregoing. As have been \ndiscussed before, the external flow can be treated as a boundary layer problem and is a well \nstudied subject. That is particularly true for the problem of the boundary layer over a flat surface \n(see for instance Schlichting, 1968). In the present work the main attention is focused on the flow \npattern and the drying behavior of the porous medium, and on the coupling between the external \nflow and the internal flow. Most of the present chapter will be devoted to this purpose.\n\n3 .1  N e t w o r k  Co n s t r u c t io n  f o r  t h e  P o r o u s  M e d iu m\n\nThe first task is to construct a network for the porous medium on which the microscopic \nmodel as discussed in section 2.2.3 can be applied. As have been mentioned in Chapter 2, the \ngeometric structure of the porous medium is complex and drying strongly depends upon this \nstructure. In this regard, it is very important to select an appropriate network model for studying \nthe porous medium. Reconstruction of porous medium has been receiving much attention in \nrecent years and the reader is referred to Fernandes (1994) and Adler (1992) for a more elaborate \ndiscussion on that. In the present work, the attention is not paid to the reconstruction of the \nporous medium. For simplicity, the network used here is a square network of pores and throats. \nEach pore is coimected to four throats. The distance between the centers of two adjacent pores is \nfixed, but the radii of pores and throats have a known distribution. In order to give a more real \nradii distribution of pores and throats to the network, experimentally measured data is used to \nobtain the parameters for the network construction. For a given porous medium, the volume of\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 2 7\n\npores of different radii can be measured, for example, by mercury porosimetry (Kloubek, 1981 \nand van Brakel et al., 1981). The experimentally measured volume distribution of the sand-caulim \nmedium to be used here is shown in Fig. 3-1. From this figure, the radii distribution of pores and \nthroats is calculated.\n\nRadii of pores (|j.m)\n\nFig. 3-1 Pore distribution of the sand-caulim mixture used \nas the porous medium in the present work (Quadri, 1988)\n\nIn a real porous medium, it is diflBcult to say what is pore and what is throat. Generally, \nthe bigger voids inside the porous medium are treated as pores and the smaller voids are treated \nas throats. Indeed, it is unknown how much empty volume in a porous medium is pores or \nthroats, since all empty volume can be treated either as pores or as throats. In the present work, \nthe empty volume will be treated as spherical pores to obtain the radii distribution of the pores.\n\nTo facilitate the network construction, the isonumber method (Philippi, 1995) is used to \nobtain the distribution of pores radii, i.e., each class of pores has the same number of pores. From \nthe data of volume fi'action of pores (Fig. 3-1), the accumulated pores number is calculated. The \ncurve of accumulated pores number versus pores radii is drawn in Fig. 3-2. From this curve, ten \nclasses of pores radii are obtained (Table 3-1).\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M eth odology 28\n\n1 .8 4 E + 6\n\n2  1.76E+6\n\n1.68E+6\n0.00 40.00 80.00 120.00 \n\nRadii of pores (n-m)\n160.00\n\nFig. 3-2 Accumulated pores number versus the pores radii\n\nAs have been mentioned before, the voids can be treated either as pores or throats. In \nother words, the distribution of the radii of throats should be the same of the pores. To obtain the \nradii distribution o f the throats, therefore, it is assumed that the throats have the same kind of \ndistribution of the pores but have a different radii range. The radii range for the pores is \n14.3-178.2 jam and the radii range for the throats, thus, can be obtained by using a factor to aU \nclasses (the factor is chosen between 0.5 -  0.9). The porosity of the network can be changed by \nusing different factors and the distance between the pores. It should be noted that the network \ndifRisive resistance for the vapor is assumed to be only due to the throats and that there is no \nresistance due to the pores; the pores resistance is somehow inserted into the throat resistance \nthrough an equivalent length. The distance between the centers of two adjacent pores is chosen to \nbe large enough to avoid the intersection of two adjacent big pores. There may be an overlap of \nradii range of pores and throats, i.e., some throats may have a bigger radius than that of some \npores. During the network construction, therefore, if a throat is found to be larger than one of the \ntwo pores at its end, it is randomly interchanged with other throat of the network.\n\nTable 3-1 Radii classes of pores and throats obtained \nfrom the experimental data\n\nRadii of pores \nX1q5 (m)\n\n17.82 9.190 5.565 4.105 3.475 3.065 2.655 2.300 1.840 1.430\n\nRadii of throats \nXIqS (m)\n\n8.910 4.595 2.783 2.053 1.738 1.533 1.328 1.150 0.920 0.715\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 29\n\n3 .2  S o l u t io n  P r o c e d u r e\n\n3.2.1 Solution Procedure for the Porous Medium\n\n3.2.1.1 Identification o f  Trapped Clusters and Location o f the Evaporating Front\n\nIn the present model, the trapped cluster phenomena is taken into account during the \ndrying process. The evaporating front recedes gradually inward the porous medium and its form \nchanges continually during the drying process. This evaporating front has to be located inside the \nnetwork in order to calculate the vapor difiiision fluxes for the empty throats. Therefore, the first \nimportant step is to develop an algorithm to scan the trapped clusters within the network. The \ntask of this scanning procedure is to find out the trapped clusters from the information of the state \nof pores and throats (empty or fiiU). Then, a number is given to each cluster to identify it since \nliquid evaporated from each cluster can be taken off only from the corresponding cluster. In fact, \nthe cluster phenomena takes places soon after some of the throats adjacent to the external \ninterface are dried. Clearly, it strongly depends on the radii distribution of throats in the porous \nmedium. The more the smaller throats are located near the surface, the sooner the clusters appear.\n\nOther task to be achieved is to identify the throats which are located on the boundary of \neach cluster. It is on those throats that evaporation and condensation take place. As drying \nproceeds, the number of clusters and their boundary change. It is necessary, therefore, to run the \nprogram at each time interval to update the information about the trapped clusters and the \nevaporating front. The algorithm for scanning clusters and some illustrative results will be \npresented in Chapter 4, together with its validation.\n\n3.2.1.2 Diffusion Fluxes in Resistance Network\n\nAfter the clusters have been identified and the evaporating front has been located, the next \nstep is to determine the diffusion flux in each empty throat. This is attained by solving equation \n(2-30) on the resistance network for the vapor difflision with the prescribed boundary conditions \nat the interface (profile of mass fraction for the external flow near the interface) and the \nevaporating front (saturated mass fraction at the menisci surface of the throats which are on the \nborder of the trapped clusters).\n\nIt is well known that equation (2-30) which gives the mass fraction of pore(i,j) can be \nwritten in two different formulations, explicit and implicit, depending on which time the mass \nfraction of the neighboring pores are determined. If the values used are those of the last iteration\n\n\n\nChapter 3 Solution M ethodology 30\n\n(known), the equation is an explicit one. In this case, the equation for each pore is independent of \nthe other equations and can be solved one by one. If the values used to evaluate the mass fraction \nof the neighboring pores are those of the present iteration (unknown), the equation is implicit. In \nthis formulation, it is necessary to solve a linear system of equations to determine the mass \nfraction for each pore. A solution of this system of equations can be obtained by a direct or \niterative way. Some direct methods are; Matrix inversion, elimination of Gauss, Fourier \ntransformation, etc. The iterative methods are: Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel, Successive Over- \nRelaxation (S.O R.), etc. (Patankar, 1980, Press et al., 1992). Clearly, the explicit formulation is \nsimpler to be adopted than the implicit one. However, the convenience of the explicit method is \noffset by a serious limitation: the time step At for each iteration have to be small enough to ensure \nstability. In present model, the implicit scheme is adopted and it is assumed that the vapor \ndiffusion between the empty pores in the porous medium is in equilibrium, i.e., the vapor entering \nan empty pore is equal to the vapor leaving the pore during a time interval At. To this extent \nequation (2-30) is simplified as\n\n\u00ae +  8M,j\u00ae i-i,j +  +  g fj-i\u00ae i,j-i) / GSUM (3-1)\n\nwhere\n\nG S U M = .g ,> g .> :,.+ g 5 + g \u00bb _ , (3-2)\n\nThe mass fraction of each empty pore is calculated one by one in the resistance network \nfor vapor diffusion by using the equation (3-1). This is done iteratively, and convergence is \nreached rapidly. After convergence has been reached, the mass fraction of the vapor in the empty \npores is taken to be constant during the drying time interval, in accordance with the implicit \nscheme. Thus, during At the vapor fluxes to and from the pores are taken to be constant.\n\nThe next step is to obtain the evaporation (or condensation) rate on the border of each \ncluster. In fact, the evaporation (or condensation) rate of the fiill throats which are on the border \nof the clusters is obtained when the resistance network for vapor diffusion is solved. To obtain the \nevaporation rate of a cluster, one just needs to sum the evaporation rate o f the throats on its \nborder. It should be noted that some of the throats are evaporating and some condensing (Fig. 3- \n3a). It is defined here that the evaporation rate is positive and the condensation rate is negative. \nThus, if the sum of the evaporation rate is positive, it means that this cluster is losing liquid by \nevaporation. If the sum is negative, the cluster is gaining liquid by condensation. The amount of \nliquid evaporated from each cluster in a given time interval can be obtained muUiplying the \nevaporation rate by the time interval. It is worthy mentioning that an empty pore can lie on the \nborder of various clusters, as indicated in (Fig. 3-3b).\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology SI\n\nThe condensing throats at the border of the clusters are marked in order to distinguish \nthem from the evaporating throats. It is important to do so because, of course, the evaporated \nliquid of a cluster cannot be removed from a condensing throat even if it is the biggest throat on \nthe border of cluster. This will be a rule in choosing the biggest throats on the evaporating front.\n\nFig. 3-3 (a) pore on the border of one cluster\n(b) pore on the border of three clusters\n\n3.2.1.3 Determination o f the Time Interval\n\nAt each time interval, it is assumed that the network is in an equilibrium, that is, the mass \nfraction at the empty pores and the diffusion fluxes through the empty throats remain constant. \nClearly, the time interval used to calculate the quantity of the Uquid evaporated from each cluster \nhas a great influence on the drying process simulation. The smaller the time interval, the better the \napproximation of drying process. Generally, the problem becomes independent of the time interval \nif liquid o f only one or two throats and pores is removed in each time interval. The time interval is \nnot fixed during the simulation because the drying rate decreases sharply after the interface is \ndried. Since the evaporating rate is bigger at the earlier times, the time interval starts with a small \nvalue, and with the receding of the evaporating front, the evaporating rate decrease and bigger \ntime intervals can be used to accelerate the marching procedure.\n\nIf the time interval were chosen arbitrarily, it could happen that some small clusters would \nhave less liquid to be removed than that that would be evaporated from them during the time \ninterval. To avoid this problem, the time interval is chosen as following.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 32\n\n\u2022 after the clusters and their borders are located, the evaporation (or condensation) rate for \neach cluster is calculated\n\n\u2022 the amount o f liquid in each cluster is obtained\n\u2022 for each evaporating cluster, the time to evaporate all liquid o f cluster is calculated\n\u2022 the smallest time is chosen to be the time interval and is used for all clusters to calculate \n\nthe amount o f liquid evaporated or condensed\n\nIn this way, it is ensured that all clusters have sufficient liquid to be removed in each time \ninterval. At the begiiming of simulation, the network is saturated , i.e., there is only one cluster in \nthe network and it is obvious that one cannot choose the time to evaporate all liquid in this cluster \n(the whole sample) as the first time interval. To avoid a too big time interval at the beginning and \nduring the simulation, a criterion is used to control the maximum time interval for different drying \nstages. The time interval increases gradually as drying proceeds since the drying rate decrease for \nlarger times.\n\n3.2.1.4 Removal o f  Liquid from Clusters\n\nSo far, it is known how much liquid is evaporated firom the border of each cluster and \ntransported to the surface of porous medium or, reversely, how much vapor is condensed to each \ncluster during a time interval At. The attention now is turned to the removing o f the liquid fi\u2019om \neach cluster. The questions are how to remove the evaporated liquid fi\u2019om each cluster, when and \nwhere the liquid removing process stops.\n\nInspection is carried out from left to right and from top to bottom o f the network during \nthe liquid removal process. If there is only one biggest throat at the evaporating front of each \ncluster in each time interval, there is no doubt that this throat loses its Uquid first. Difficulties \nappear when there are more than one biggest throat on the cluster border at the same time \ninterval. One has to determine, thus, from which throat the liquid should be removed first. \nAccording to the mechanism for liquid transfer of the present model (capillarity), the biggest \nthroats can lose their liquid because they have the same radius, regardless of their location on the \ncluster border. There are various ways to remove the evaporated liquid from each cluster. For a \ngiven cluster, for example, the first biggest throat encountered at the cluster border during the \ninspection can be chosen as the throat from which the liquid is removed first. As soon as the liquid \nof this throat is removed, the liquid of the connecting pore is also removed because, as have been \nmentioned before, the pores have priority to evaporate. After the liquid from the pore is removed, \nother three connecting throats become located on the evaporating front. The removal process for \nthis throat can stop and the inspection goes on, or, the process can only stop when the radii of the\n\n\n\n0 \u2022 a &lt;4 ^  -  I\nChapter 3 Solution Methodology 33\n\nthree connecting throats are smaller than that of the other throats that lie on the border. The way \nemployed to simulate the drying process, of course, can affect the simulation result in a significant \nextent. Since only a little amount of liquid (of one or two throats or pores) is removed from a \ncluster in a time interval, this influence is strong. The left top part of the porous medium will be \ndried more rapidly than the right part because the inspection routine is always started from the left \ntop part of the network.\n\nIn the present model, the liquid removal from a given evaporating cluster is performed by \nthe following steps:\n\n1. The biggest throat radius is obtained by comparing the radii of the evaporating throats \non the border of cluster. The condensing throats are not considered during the \ninspection.\n\n2. The first biggest fiill throat encountered on the border of a cluster during the \ninspection is taken as the first throat from which the liquid is removed.\n\n3. The liquid of this throat is removed if it is an evaporating throat. Contrarily, the \ninspection goes on to encounter the next biggest throat.\n\n4. After the liquid of this throat is removed, the liquid within the pore which is \nconnected to the biggest throat (at other end) is removed.\n\n5. The other three fiill throats are marked as the throats on the border and the liquid \nremoval process in this throats stops.\n\n6. The inspection goes on to find out other biggest fiiU throat on the border.\n7. Steps 1-6 is repeated until all the evaporated Uquid is removed from this cluster.\n\nff the given cluster is a condensing one, condensed Uquid is given to it by the foUowing\nsteps:\n\n1. The biggest throat radius is obtained by comparing the radu of the throats on the \nborder of cluster, regardless of it is evaporating or condensing.\n\n2. The first biggest fiiU throat encountered on the border of the cluster during the \ninspection is taken as the throat on which the condensed Uquid is put.\n\n3. The Uquid is given to this throat, and what is changed is the amount of the Uquid in \nthe throat. The meniscus position is considered the same.\n\nFor simpUcity, the Uquid volume within the throats is calculated considering a plane \nmenisci surface.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 34\n\nThe liquid removal process is performed cluster by cluster until all of the evaporated liquid \nis taken off from the evaporating cluster and the condensed liquid is placed on the condensing \ncluster.\n\nFor an evaporating cluster, the amount of evaporated liquid during a time interval is hardly \nequal to the amount of liquid in the chosen throats and pores. At the end of the time interval, the \namount of evaporated liquid to be removed may be less than that of a biggest throat or a pore. \nUnder this circumstance, some liquid is left in the throat or pore after the evaporated liquid is \ntaken off from this throat or pore. If this occurs for a throat, the throat is treated as a fixll one in \nthe next iteration but the quantity o f liquid in it is less than before. Thus, the meniscus will not be \nat the end of the throat. Instead, the meniscus recedes inside the throat as shown in Fig. 3-4a. For \na throat having two empty pores at its ends (liquid bridge), the menisci of both side recede inside \nthe throat (Fig. 3-4b). It should be noted that evaporation-condensation mechanism can take place \nat this kind of throats. In fact, the liquid bridge in the throat is a small trapped cluster. For a big \ntrapped cluster, the evaporation-condensation mechanism can also take place because one can \nlook all trapped clusters as liquid bridges. The difference is that for a small trapped cluster (one \nthroat), there is only one evaporating meniscus and one condensing meniscus, for a big trapped \ncluster, however, there may be various evaporating and condensing menisci.\n\n(a)\n\nFig 3-4 Diagram showing the possible position of menisci of throat\n\nAs have been shown in Fig 3-4, there are various possible positions for menisci inside the \nthroats. Regardless o f where the menisci are, this kind of throat is treated in the same manner as a \ncompletely fiill throat in the next time interval, and the evaporating rate at receded menisci is \nobtained in the same manner of that at menisci at the ends of throat.\n\nIf the liquid removing process is terminated in a pore and the amount of liquid left to be \nremoved is less than the existing amount o f liquid within this pore (Fig. 3-5), then the evaporated \nliquid is removed from this pore and this pore is treated as an empty one in the next iteration. The \nfiill throats connected to this pore are taken to be on the evaporating front in the next iteration. \nThis kind of pore will be taken as the first one to be evaporated in next iteration, that is, it is\n\n\n\nChapter 3 Solution M ethodology 35\n\ntreated as the biggest throat on the evaporating border at the next time interval. It should be noted \nthat in the last time interval, this pore and its three connected fiill throats belong to the same \ncluster. As it becomes an \"empty\" pore during the next time interval, it no longer link the three \nfiiU throats. In this circumstance, the three fiill throats may be in three different clusters. \nConsidering that the vapor diffiision flux in the empty throat is the result of evaporation from \nthree full throats, the liquid left in this pore should be distributed among the dijBFerent clusters to \nwhich the three throats belong. The liquid left in this pore, is then equally divided and distributed \namong the different clusters.\n\nFig. 3-5 Diagram o f pore with left liquid\n\nAll procedures performed during a time interval within the porous medium is completed at \nthis point. Next, the network is inspected again to identify trapped clusters and evaporating fronts \nfor the next time interval. To obtain the vapor fluxes in the resistance network, a new boundary \ncondition has to be given at the interface between the porous medium and the external flow. \nTherefore, the mass fraction field of the external flow should be updated. The calculation o f the \nmass fraction in the external flow will be explored next.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 36\n\n3.2.2 Solution for External Flow\n\nThe mathematical model for external flow is given by equations (2-l)-(2-3). To solve \nthose differential equations, use is made o f the control volume methodology due to Patankar \n(1980). In this methodology, the calculation domain is divided into a number of nonoverlapping \ncontrol volumes such that there is one control volume surrounding each grid point (Fig. 3-6). The \ngoverning equation is then integrated over each control volume and a set of algebraic equations is \nobtained as explored in the next section.\n\n(5 x ),\n\nFig. 3-6 Control volume for the two-dimensional situation\n\n3.2.2.1 Discretization o f  Differential Equations\n\nThe governing differential equations are integrated over each control volume. Piecewise \nprofiles expressing the variation of the variables of interest (such as U^, Uy and o , etc.) between \nadjacent grid points are used to evaluate the required integrals. The outcome is algebraic \nequations containing the value of the variables of interest for a group of grid points. The value of \nthe variable in each control volume is taken as constant and equal to the value of the grid point at \nthe center o f control volume.\n\nEquation (2-2) and (2-3) can be written in the general form as\n\n\n\nChapter 3 Solution M ethodology 37\n\n+ S (3-3)\n\nwhere the (j) is the general variable (Ux, Uy and co, for example), F is the diffusion coefficient and \nthe S is the source term. The two-dimensional discretization equation for this general differential \nequation can be written as (for the details of discretization, one can refer to Patankar, 1980)\n\nap(j)p = aE(|)E + aw<l)w + ^ (3-4)\n\nwhere\n\naE = D.A(|P.|) + [| - F \u201e 0\n\naH = D .

The source term is \nlinearized in the form of S = Sc + Sp(l)p. The mass flow rate through the east face of a typical\n\ncontrol volume Fg, the corresponding conductance Dg, and the Peclet number P^ are defined as\n\nFe =(puXAy (3-12)\n\n(Sx),\n(3-13)\n\nPe = \u2014  D.\n(3-14)\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology S8\n\nThe mass flow rates, conductances and Peclet numbers for other three faces of a typical \ncontrol volume are defined in the same way. The interpolation fiinction A (p ) can be selected\n\nfrom various schemes such as central difference, upwind, hybrid, power law and exponential \n(Patankar, 1980). Here, the power law scheme is adopted, in which,\n\na ( |p |) = [| 0 , ( l - 0 . l |P |) '  I] (3 - 1 5 )\n\nNote that the discretzation form of the general differential equation can be used to solve \nthe transient problem. In our work, it is assumed that the external flow has reached a steady state \nin each drying time mtemal. Under this circumstance, we just let the At in equation (3-11) tends \nto infimte, yielding, a  ? equal to zero. The information of the mass transfer of the internal flow \n(porous medium) is passed to the external flow through the source term in equation (2-3). This \nwill be discussed in more details in section 3 .3.\n\n3.2.2.2 Solution o f  the Algebraic Equations\n\nThe solution of the set of algebraic equations for an one-dimensional situation can be \nobtained by the standard Gaussian-elimination method. Sometimes, it is called the TDMA \n(TriDiagonal-Matrix Algorithm). The designation TDMA refers to the fact that when the matrix \nof the coefficients o f these equations is written, all the nonzero coefficients align themselves along \nthree diagonals of the matrix. For the two-dimensional situation, direct method (i.e., these \nrequiring no iteration) for solving the algebraic equations are much more compUcated and require \nrather large amounts of computer storage and time. For a linear problem, which requires the \nsolution of the algebraic equations only once, a direct method may be acceptable, but in nonlinear \nproblems, since the equations have to be solved repeatedly with updated coefficients, the use of a \ndirect method is usually not economic. Thus, the line by line method which combines the direct \nmethod (TDMA) for one dimensional ( for a chosen grid line) and the Guauss-Seidel method is \nused, To carry the information of the boundary conditions into domain more rapidly, the TDMA \ncan be carried out in the grid line by line forward, then backward and column by column \ndownward, then upward and so on.\n\nFor the solution of the algebraic equation associated to the differential equation (2-3), \nthere is no difficulty in determming the source term because the evaporation rate at the interface is \nknown from the solution of the network. However, difficulty arises in the calculation of the \nsource term for the velocity field, that is, the unknown pressure field. This is so because there is \nno obvious equation to obtain the pressure field. The pressure field is indirectly specified via the\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 39\n\ncontinuity equation (equation (2-1)). When the correct pressure field is substituted into the \nmomentum equation, the resulting velocity field satisfies the continuity equation.\n\nHere, the SIMPLER algorithm is used to calculate the velocity field. It consists of solving \nthe pressure equation fi'om a guessed velocity field to obtain the pressure field and solving a \npressure-correction equation only to correct the velocities (for more details, see Patankar, 1980, \n1981).\n\n3 .3  Co u p l in g  o f  E x t e r n a l  F l o w  w it h  P o r o u s M e d iu m\n\nFor the problem of convective drying of porous medium such as sketched in Fig. 2-1, one \nshould pay attention to the coupUng of the external and the internal flow. Generally, for the \nconvective drying of the porous medium, the scale of external flow is different firom the scale of \ninternal flow. As have been discussed in Chapter 1, in macroscopic model o f porous media, the \nvariables of interest are not representative of transfer at the pore scale but of transfer at the scale \nof small volumes containing a sufficient nimiber of pores (R E. V ). Clearly, the scale of such kind \nof models is bigger than that of the external flow model. Under this circumstance, there are some \ndoubt on the classic coupling method of external flow with internal flow. Plumb and Prat (1992) \nstudied the size o f R.E.V. of the porous medium, and they found that the Representative \nElementary Volume for mass transfer is larger than that traditionally accepted for properties such \nas porosity and dry diffiisivity.\n\nIn the present microscopic model for the porous medium, there is no doubt about scale \nbecause the equations used to describe the drying are derived at the pore scale. In other words, \nthe variables for the porous medium are evaluated in the same scale of the variables for the \nexternal flow. This is one of the main advantages of using the microscopic model for the porous \nmedium.\n\nIn the drying problem under consideration, the surface of the porous medium is flat. \nRegarding the computer storage capacity and reasonable computer time, the network size of \npores and throats for the porous medium will not be bigger than 100x100 in the present \nsimulation. The grid for the external flow could be of the same size or smaller. The control \nvolume at the interface, for instance, can couple with one or various throats as shown in Fig. 3-7. \nThe internal flow problem is solved separately fi'om the external flow problem, and the coupling \nof the two problems is made by passing the information either of the evaporation rate of fiill \nthroats or vapor flux of empty throats to the control volumes adjacent to the external flow via \nsource term in equation (2-3). That is, the vapor transported into the external flow through the\n\n\n\nChapter 3 Solution M ethodology 40\n\ninterface is treated as it is generated in the control volume adjacent to the interface. Thus, the \ninterface is taken as impermeable during the solution of equation (2-3). Equation (2-11) is used to \ncalculate the evaporation rate of a fiill throat on the interface. The derivative of the mass fi'action \nin equation (2-11) is calculated in different ways depending if the throat is fiill or empty. The two \ncases are shown in Fig. 3-8. For the external flow, the mass fi\u2019action is taken to be uniform along \neach control volume and is evaluated in its center as shown in Fig. 3-8. The distance used to \nobtain the derivative of the mass fi\u2019action, therefore, is somehow arbitrary.\n\nFig. 3-7 Coupling of grid for external flow with the network\n\nFig. 3-8 Diagram of throats on interface\n\n\n\nC h a p te rs Solution M ethodology 41\n\nFor full throats, the distance used here is that between the center point of the control \nvolume and the surface of the meniscus (at the interface or receded meniscus). The mass fraction \nat the meniscus (saturated) can be calculated using equations (2-14)~(2-18). For empty throats, \nthe vapor flux is calculated using equation (2-12). The distance employed to obtain the derivative \nof the mass fraction is that from the center of the control volume to the center of the empty pore.\n\nThe boundary condition at the interface for equation (2-2) is the no-slip assumption \ntogether with the blowing velocity given by equation (2-12). The interface is treated as an \nimpermeable one for equation (2-3).\n\nIt is worthy mentioning that the two-dimensional grid used to solve the external flow, in \nfact, has an unity thickness in the z-direction. If the network for the porous medium is two- \ndimensional, i.e., the throats are rectangular and the pores are cylindrical, the network can be \ntaken as a network with an unity thickness in z-direction as shown in Fig. 3-9. Thus, the interface \nof both the external flow and the porous medium have the same thickness. To calculate the vapor \ntransported into the control volume, the intersection area of the rectangular throat (shaded area) \nis used.\n\nFig. 3-9 Coupling of a 2D grid with a 2D network of rectangular throats\nand cylindrical pores\n\nHowever, for a two-dimensional network of cylindrical throats and spherical pores, the \nnetwork thickness has a certain value (the radius of the largest pore, for example). Under this \ncircumstance, the intersection area of the throats on the interface is their sectional area (darken\n\n\n\nChapter 3 Solution M ethodology\n42\n\narea m Fig. 3-10), but the control volume for external flow has an unity thickness. Clearly, the \nsectional area of the interface for the external flow and the network is incompatible. Thus, the \nmtersection area for the network at the interface have to be modified to make it compatible with \nthe control volume of the external flow. To do so, the diffiision rate of empty throats and the \nevaporation rate of full throats at the interface are modified from the sectional area of throats to \nthe square area with a width o f the diameter of the throats. Thus, the vapor transported into the \ncontrol volume is calculated by multiplying the modified vapor diffusion or evaporation rate by \nthe rectangular area with a width of the diameter and a thickness of unity (shaded area).\n\nFig. 3-10 Coupling of a 2D grid with a 2D network o f cylindrical throats\nand spherical pores\n\nOf course, one could have made the control volume compatible to the network by \nreducing the thickness o f the control volume in z-direction fi-om unity to the same thickness of the \nnetwork.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 43\n\nCh a p t e r  4  S u b r o u t i n e  S c a n c l u s t e r\n\n4.1 In t r o d u c t io n\n\nThe trapped clusters phenomenon in the latter period of the convective drying problem has \nto be taken into account in the numerical simulation due to its great influence on the liquid phase \ndistribution in the porous media. Because of this phenomenon, the evaporating front inside the \nporous medium has a complex form that changes during the drying process. In Chapter 3, it was \ndescribed how the evaporated (or condensed) liquid of each cluster in a time interval can be taken \noff or put on. Therefore, the trapped clusters in the network should be identified, labeled and the \nevaporating front should be located in each time interval. To perform this process in the numerical \nsimulation, an algorithm was developed.\n\nThe infinite and finite cluster in an infinite network is a general concept of percolation \ntheory. The dynamic and static aspects of percolation phenomena are well known and to a large \nextent understood. The concept of percolation has been closely associated with the permeation of \nfluid through porous media. The formation of an infinite cluster of identical molecules in a \nnetwork can also be described within the framework of percolation theory.\n\nThe algorithm for locating clusters in a network is discussed here as a chapter because it is \nnot only usefiil for the present convective drying problem, but also for other situation. Various \nexamples of phenomena that need this kind of algorithm are encountered in the literature. These \ninclude among others: spontaneous magnetization of dilute ferromagnets (Elliott et al., 1960), \nspreading of diseases in orchards (Broadbent et al., 1957), formation of polymer gels (Flory, \n1953), electrical conductivity of amorphous semiconductors and metal-ammonia solutions \n(Eggarter et al., 1971 and Cohen et al., 1976), distribution of grain size in photographic emulsions \n(Kottler et al., 1950), and exciton percolation in isotopically disordered crystals and\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 44\n\nphotosynthetic units (Kopelman et al., 1975 and Kopelman, 1976). It should be noted that this list \nincludes only a small \"random sample\" of a variety of percolation process occurring in nature.\n\nVarious mathematical and computational approaches to the problem, including their scope \nand limitations, have been outlined in numerous papers and review articles (Frisch et al., 1963, \nFisher, 1964, Essan, 1973). Computational methods broadly termed as Monte Carlo methods \n(Broadbent et al, 1957) are applied to finite sublattices whereas percolation theory, basically, is \nconcerned with the probabihty for locating an infinite cluster in an infinite lattice.\n\nThe difficulties encountered in a solution of a percolation problem utilizing the direct \nsimulation approach are the limitation of computer storage capacity and computer speed. Hoshen \nand Kopelman (1976) developed a \"cluster multiple labeling technique\" to save storage and \ncomputer time. Its distinctive feature is the assignment of alternate labels to sites belonging to the \nsame cluster. This technique algorithm is briefly described in the following.\n\nThe first time an marked site (it could be a site occupied by a certam molecule, or, a fiiU \npore, etc.) is encountered during the inspection of the lattice the label counter k is set to an initial \nvalue k(). The increment Ak is a small positive integer. For the site /, its neighbors are searched \nfirst. Generally, the neighbors of site / are defined as those sites connected by bonds to site i. The \nnumber of neighbors is equal to the bond order of site /. If there are no labeled neighbors in the \nvicinity of site /, the site is assigned a new label after k is incremented. If there is only one labeled \nneighbor, site / gets the same label of its neighbor. The unique features of the cluster multiple \nlabeling technique become apparent when there are more than one labeled neighbors, that is, the \nsite / links two or more previously labeled cluster fi^agments into a single cluster. No site \nbelonging to any of these cluster fragments is relabeled and it retains its original label throughout \nthe inspection process. The actual readjustments occurs within the number counters of these \nclusters. All the labeled sites of these clusters is added to the cluster which has the smallest cluster \nnumber and the nimiber counters of these clusters are set to a negative integer (with the same \nnumber o f the smallest cluster number). With this readjustment, these clusters are coalesced into a \nnew larger cluster without relabeling. Site labeling and cluster size classification can be \naccomplished by a single scan of the lattice. The additional advantage of the single scan process is \nthat only a fraction of the columns (or layers) have to reside in the computer memory \nconcurrently. The entire lattice need not to be stored on the computer because after a segment of \ncolumns (or layers) have been processed they are not referred to again by the program.\n\nThe idea of \"cluster multiple labeling technique\" can be used in the present algorithm. It \nshould be mentioned that this algorithm requires not only the ability of locating and labeUng the \nclusters in a square network, but also the ability of locating the pores and throats which are on the\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 45\n\nevaporating or condensing front of each cluster. The algorithm developed by Hoshen and \nKopelman (1974), which uses the \"cluster muhiple labeling technique\", labels a same cluster using \nvarious number. Difficulties will arise at later drying stages if a cluster is labeled with more than \none number, and Hoshen and Kopelman algorithm has to be altered for the same cluster to be \nlabeled with only one number; the number o f clusters in the network should be then a set of \nnatural numbers.\n\n4 .2  S c a n n in g  t h e  C l u s t e r\n\nAs have been pointed out, the clusters in the porous medium have to been located for each \ntime interval. Therefore, a subroutine SCANCLUSTER was developed specially to perform this \ntask. The subroutine is required not only to locate the clusters in the porous medium but also to \ngive a natural number (label) to each cluster. This subroutine was written for a network of pores \nand throats (the bond order is four), but it could be used to other kind of network after some \nmodification. The algorithm is shown in Fig. 4-1. The scanning process is done row by row, from \nleft to right and from top to bottom of the network. The first time a fijll throat or pore is \nencountered during the inspection of the network, the label counter k is set to an initial value k?  \n(normally ko equal to 1). Three matrix are used to store the label number, one for pores, one for \nvertical throats and another for horizontal throats.\n\nThe network used to represent the porous medium in the present work is a square \nnetwork of pores and throats. For the problem of convective drying shown in Fig. 2-1, on the \nborder of the network there are only throats (Fig. 3-6). The scanning process is done pore by \npore, and for each pore the connecting throats are also scanned.\n\nAt the beginning of the scanning, pore (1,1) is checked. If it is frill, it is labeled with 1 and \nits four neighbor throats are labeled with the same number. This is so because it is assumed in the \npresent model that the pore will be empty as soon as one of its four neighbor throats has been \nempty. As discussed earlier, this is a basic rule for the program. If the pore is empty, the fiall \nneighbor throats are labeled in sequence using different number with an increment Ak=l. Empty \npores and throats are not labeled.\n\nFor the other pores of the first row, the neighbor throat of the left hand side does not need \nto be scanned because it has already been done in last pore. If the pore is fiall, the pore and other \nthree neighbor throats are labeled with the same number of the left neighbor throat. If the pore is \nempty, the fiall neighbor throats of top, right and bottom are labeled having different numbers with \nan increment o f Ak= 1.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 46\n\n1pore (1,1)\nIf pore is M l, label pore and four \nneighbor diroats with same number \nIf pore is empty, label neighbor \nfiill diroats with di\u00a3ferent number \nwith increment o f 1\n\nI\npore (i,l)\n\nIf pore is fiill, label pore and three neighbor \nthroats with same number o f top throat \nIf pore is empty, label fiill throats \no f left, right and bottom in different \nnumber with increment of 1\n\ni\n1p o r e (lj)\n\nIf pore is fiill, label pore and three \nneighbor throats with same number of left \nthroat\nIf pore is empty, label fiill throats o f top, \nright and bottom with different number \nwith increment of 1\n\npore (i j )\n\nIf pore is fiill, label pore, right and bottom \nthroats with smae number of the minimiim \nnumber of top and right throats \nIf pore is empty, label fiill throats of right \nand bottom with different number with \nincrement o f 1\n\n' n --------------------------\n\nCall subroutine CLUSTER to re-label a cluster \nwhen it is found that one cluster was labeled \nwith different number\n\nCall subroutine CLUSTER to rearrange the \ncluster number as a natural number set\n\nFig. 4-1 Subroutine SCANCLUSTER\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster _fj\n\nFor the pores which are in the first column, the top neighbor throat is not scanned. The \npore and other three neighbor throats are labeled with the same number of the top throat if the \npore is fiill. Contrarily, the fiill neighbor throats of left, right and bottom are labeled using \ndifferent numbers with an increment of Ak=l.\n\nFor the rest of pores, only the right and bottom neighbor throats are scaimed because the \nleft and top neighbor throats have already been scaimed. If the pore is empty, the right and bottom \nneighbor throats are labeled with numbers different than that if they were fiill. There are two \npossibilities for a fiall pore. First, the left and top neighbor throats have the same number, then, the \npore, right and bottom neighbor throats are labeled wdth this number. For the second possibility \nfor a fiill pore, the left and top neighbor throats have different number. For this case, the pore and \nthe two throats are labeled using the smaller number of the top and left neighbor throat. Note that \nthis cluster that have different numbers for the left and top neighbor throats is really the same \ncluster, eventhough it is labeled with different numbers. It have to be re-labeled in a latter step \nbecause there should be an one to one correspondence between numbers and clusters.\n\nAfter all fiall pores and throats are labeled, the next step is to change the number of \nclusters which were labeled with more than one number. A subroutine CLUSTER is written to do \nthis job. Only fiiU pores is scanned during the inspection because an empty pore can not link a \ncluster. If it is found that the four fiall throats of a fiall pore have different numbers, they have to \nbe relabeled, since they are in the same cluster, and the same cluster should have the same \nnumber. The smaller o f the numbers is found and all pores and throats which have the same \nnumber o f the other throats (bigger than the smaller number) in the network are relabeled using \nthe smaller number. As a result, each cluster will have only one number after the subroutine \nCLUSTER is called. A problem that arises is that some natural numbers disappear during this \nprocess, and the cluster number is no longer in sequence. Clearly, there is no problem to identify \nthe clusters if the clusters have different number, even if these numbers are not in sequence \nHowever, this is not convenient from a computational point of view because it is difficuh to use \nthe DO LOOP command if the clusters numbers that are not in sequence. To overcome this \ndifficulty, the subroutine CLUSTER is used again to rearrange the cluster number.\n\nThe subroutine CLUSTER is called when it is found that a natural number is absent. One \nof the cluster which has a cluster number bigger than the absent one is relabeled by using this \nnumber. This is repeated until no cluster number is bigger than the last natural number. The last \nnatural number is the number of clusters in network.\n\nThe pores and throats which are on the border of each cluster are found and marked in the \nsubroutine SCANCLUSTER. In fact, it is these throats that represent the evaporation front inside\n\n\n\nC hapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 48\n\nthe network. This is an important information when evaporated liquid is taken off from each \ncluster. The biggest full throat from which the evaporated liquid is removed should be on the \nborder o f each cluster. Therefore, the pores and throats which are on the border of each clusters \nare marked by 1, and the others by 0. By using this information associated to the cluster number, \none can identify the evaporating (or condensing) border o f each clusters.\n\nAfter subroutine SCANCLUSTER is called once, one know how many clusters are there \nin the network, which pores and throats are in the same cluster and which pores and throats of \none cluster are on its border (evaporation or condensation front).\n\nThe subroutine SCANCLUSTER is fundamental in using the microscopic model. Its \nvalidity and efficiency, of course, has a strong influence on the simulation since it has to be used \nfor each time interval. In what follows SCANCLUSTER will be used to scan some network \ndemonstrating its validity and efficiency.\n\n4.3 S o m e  Il l u s t r a t iv e  Re s u l t s  o f  SCANCLUSTER\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0  \n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0  \n\n1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0  \n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n\n0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0  0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0  1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n0 0 \n1 0 0 0 0  \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1 \n\n11111 \n1 1\n\nFig. 4-2 An example of liquid distribution in network\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 49\n\nTo illustrate the validity and efficiency of subroutine SCANCLUSTER. a network, shown \nin Fig. 4-2, containing 10x30 pores Aviil now be processed.

Considering that this \nSCANCLUSTER will be used in a network bigger than 100x100, its efficiency is as important as \nits accuracy. Therefore, the SCANCLUSTER will now be used on various network to study its \nefficiency.\n\n\n\nC hapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 51\n\n4.4 SCANCLUSTER E f f ic ie n c y\n\nThe SCANCLUSTER will now be used on various network to examine its efficiency. The \ncomputer is an IBM 3090. The efficiency of the SCANCLUSTER subroutine is clearly shown in \nFig. 4-5, where the time required for locating and labeling the clusters in a network is plotted \nversus the number o f sites processed in network. Mere 8 seconds is required to process a network \ncontaining 10,000 (the number of clusters in this network is 298) sites illustrating the efficiency of \nthe method. It should be noted that the 100x100 network contain 10,000 pores and 20,000 \nthroats. The actual number of sites processed for this network is about 30,000.\n\nSite number processed\n\nFig. 4-5 A plot of the computer central-processor-unit (CPU) time \nversus the number of sites processed in a network o f 30x30 to \n\n100x100 pores; the number of clusters in each network is different.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the CPU time required to process a network not only depend \nupon the number o f sites in network, but also on the number of clusters. The CPU time required \nto process a network of 100x100 at the beginning of drying (corresponding less clusters), for \nexample, is different from that of the same network at the later period o f drying (corresponding \nmore clusters). Fig. 4-6 gives a example of the influence of the number o f clusters on the required \nCPU time.\n\nFig. 4-6 demonstrates that the number o f clusters in the network have a strong influence \non the required CPU time. For a 100x100 network (containing 30,000 equivalent sites), it took\n\n\n\nC hapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 52\n\nonly 2 seconds to execute SCANCLUTER in presence of 14 clusters, and it took 11 seconds for \n413 clusters in the network. Considering that the maximum network which will be used to study \nthe convective drying is 100x100 pores, the required CPU time is expected to be less than 30 \nseconds.\n\ntoTJ\ncOo(Dut\na>\nE\n\n3\nQ.\nO\n\n12.00\n\n10.00 -\n\n8.0 0 -\n\n6 . 0 0 -\n\n4 .0 0 -\n\n2.00\n\n0.00 1 ' I ' r  \n0 100 200 300 400 500 \n\nNumber of clusters in network\n\nFig. 4-6 A plot o f the computer CPU time versus the number \no f clusters in a network of 100x100 pores\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results and Discussions 53\n\nC h a p t e r  5  R e s u l t s  a n d  D i s c u s s i o n s\n\nAll drying simulations to be explored were made on a two-dimensional network containing\n4,000 throats and 2,000 pores (100x20). The pores are cylindrical and the throats are rectangular. \nThe real size of the network is 6.0 cm (width) x 1.2 cm (depth). The thickness of the network is \nunity. The network is so chosen because the major interests here are focused at the beginning of \nthe drying (near the interface of the porous medium and the external dry air flow). As have been \ndiscussed before, the dry pitches which appear at the very beginning o f the drying process have a \ngreat influence upon the transfer coefficients of the interface. If the network is chosen as a square \none with the same number of pores and throats (a network of 50x50, for example), it has both \nwidth and depth of 3 cm. Although the sites that should be processed for each time interval of \ndrying are practically the same for the two network, the 50x50 network needs a longer time to be \ndried entirely because it has a larger depth. The drying rate is very high at the beginning while the \ninterface is wetted with liquid and decreases sharply after the interface is dried. Thus, a 50x50 \nnetwork needs more iterations for a simulation than a 100x20 network.\n\nThe radii classes of the pores and throats used to construct the network are listed in Table \n5-1. One can note that the size distribution o f the pores and throats is different from the data \npresented in chapter 3. The reason to modify the size distribution is that the porosity of the \nnetwork is very small if the distance of two pores is large (600 iim, for example). On other hand, \nthe network size will be too small if the distance of two pores is reduced.\n\nTable 5-1 Radii classes of pores and throats used to construct the network\n\nRadii of pores \nX 10?

The boundary \ncondition imposed on the open edge (the up side of the network) is the mass fraction of vapor \nequal to zero. The other three edges of the network are impermeable. The total pressure within \nthe network is assumed to be atmospheric and the physical properties of alcohol used in the \nsimulation are given in Table 5-2.\n\nTable 5-2 Physical properties o f alcohol\n\ng  (N/m)\n0.0217\n\np,(Kg/m3)\n815\n\n^ab (mVs)\n0.815x10-5\n\nPvs (kg/m3)\n\n0.102\nPys (Pa)\n4159.6\n\nMa (s )\n60.09\n\nBefore considering the configuration sketched in Fig. 2-1, attention will focused on some \nbehavior o f the microscopic model for porous medium, such as the influence of network \nformation, the Kelvin effect and the evaporation-condensation phenomenon in the network. \nFirstly, the influence of the network formation on the drying process is studied.\n\n5.1 In f l u e n c e  o f  t h e  N e t w o r k  F o r m a t io n  o n  t h e  D r y i n g  K in e t i c s\n\nThe network used in the microscopic model to represent the porous medium structure, as \nhave been discussed in chapter 2, is constructed by placing pores and throats randomlv in a square \narray. The size o f pores and throats have a known distribution obtained from the experimental \ndata. The networks constructed in this way have the same statistical characteristics such as \nporosity, number of pores and throats of each size class. However, the position of the pores and \nthroats in the network can be different during the different construction because, as have been \nmentioned before, the pores and the throats are placed in the network randomly. Clearly, the \nnetworks constructed have some difference in a local view. The throats on the interface, for \nexample, can have different sizes for different networks. This difference, as can be expected, will \nhave an influence on their drying behavior. In this section the influence of network formation wiU \nbe studied. All results to be presented in this section include the Kelvin effect.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results and Discussions 55\n\n5.1.1 Drying Kinetics\n\nTo study the influence of liquid phase distribution upon the drying performance, five \nnetworks were constructed by using the same pores radii and throats radii distribution. Both the \npores and throats radii have ten classes within the range of 39-250 (xm and 32.7-208 [im \nrespectively. The distance between the centers of two adjacent pores is 0.6 nrni. Each class of \nradius has the same number of throats or pores. The porosity of network is about 0.5. The drying \nprocess was simulated on these five networks under the same conditions. The drying kinetics \nresuhs are presented in Fig. 5-1. The results are plotted as saturation, s, of network (volume of \nliquid divided by empty volimie) versus drying time.\n\nDrying Time (hours)\n\nFig. 5-1 Drying curves for five networks\n\nIt is seen from Fig. 5-1 that the drying curves for the five networks have the same \ncharacteristics. Although these five networks have the same geometrical size and the same \ndistribution of the pores and throats sizes, the times which are needed to dry the networks to the \nsaturation S=0.1 are different. The difference of the end drying times between the fastest one and \nthe slowest one is about 20%. However, it was noted that the drying times can have a difference \nof more than 45% near the saturation S=0.4. The drying curves begin to deviate fi'om the \nbeginning of the drying and the deviation increases with the drying process until the saturation\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d  Discussions S6\n\nreaches about 0.4. Clearly, the drying rates for each network are different during this period. \nAfler S=0.40, the drying curves become parallel, which implies that the drying rates tend to be the \nsame for the five networks. Furthermore, an interesting evidence was noted. The network 2 dries \nmore slowly than network 3 before S=0.6 but this tendency is then inverted after that. It seems \nthat initially the drying rate of network 2 is small but is accelerated after S=0.6. To have a better \nlook of it, the drying rate curves are plotted in Fig. 5-2.\n\n5.1.2 Drying Rate\n\nThe drying rate in Fig. 5-2 is the drying time derivative of saturation (dS/dt). One can see \nclearly fi-om Fig. 5-2 that the drying rates are very high at the beginning of the drying process (the \ninterface is completely wetted with liquid) and then, decrease very quickly. The difference of the \ndrying rates for different networks appear soon after some area of interface is dried (formation of \ndry pitches at the interface). This difference increases with the reducing saturation and reaches the \nmaximum near S=0.6. After S=0.4, the drying rates of the five networks tend to be the same. This \nis coincident with the observation of Fig. 5-1.\n\n0.60\n\n0.501\nsz\n\n0.40\nCO\n3 ,\n\n0.30\ncS\n\nD> 0.20\nC\n?>,e  -\nQ 0.10\n\n0.00\n\nNetwork 1 \n\nNetwork 2 \n\nNetwork 3 \n\nNetwork 4 \n\nNetwork 5\n\n\u2014 ,  ?  ?  ? ^   ? ^ ^ ^\n\n1.00 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.00 \nSaturation, S\n\nFig. 5-2 Drying rates for five networks\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d  Discussions S7\n\nObserving the drying rates of network 2 and network 3 in Fig. 5-2, one can find that the \ndrying rate of the network 2 decreases more rapidly than that of network 3 before S=0.70. Then, \nthe drying rate o f network 2 and network 3 maintain constant with a higher drying rate of \nnetwork 3. At the S=0.5, the drying rate of network 3 decreases again and becomes lower than \nthe drying rate of network 2 which continue to be constant. This suggests that there are \nsomething occurring near the S=0.50 for network 3. In order to understand it better, the \nevaporating area inside the five networks during the drjdng process are presented in Fig. 5-3.\n\n5.1.3 Evaporating Area in the Network\n\nThe evaporating area plotted in Fig. 5-3 is the sum of the border area of trapped clusters. \nIt is obtained by summmg up all the sectional area of the throats which are on the border of each \nevaporating trapped cluster. One can note that the evaporating areas at high saturations are \nalmost the same for five networks. This is so because the initial evaporating area is exactly the \nsectional area of the throats on the interface. For all five networks, there is a small difference in \nthe evaporating area at the very begiiming of drying.\n\n0.12\n\n0.10\nCN\nE  0.08 -\n\nS  0.06 \n<\no> 0.04 -\n\n2  0.02 H \no\nQl\n5  0.00 -  \nLU\n\n-0.02 ^  \n\n-0.04\n\nNetwork 1 \nNetwork 2 \nNetwork 3 \nNetwork 4 \nNetwork 5\n\nT\n1.00 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.00 \n\nSaturation, S\n\nFig. 5-3 Evaporating area inside the network during the drying\n\n\n\nCO\nC h a p te r s  Results and Discussions\n\nAs drying proceeds, the trapped clusters in each network are not the same, i.e., the liquid \nphase distribution in the network during the drying simulation is different for each network. This \ndifference results in different evaporating areas for the different networks. It is found, however, \nthat the evaporating area curves for the five networks have the same characteristics as shown in \nFig. 5-3. The evaporating area increase due to the formation of trapped clusters for S>0.70. Then, \nthe evaporating area oscillates and for S<0.3 the evaporating area begin to decrease. The \nperformance of the evaporating area curves will be discussed in more details latter with the liquid \nphase distribution maps.\n\nIt was also found that the evaporating area curves present a correspondence with the \ndrying curves, i.e., the network which dries faster has a higher evaporating area than the network \nwhich dries slower. For the network 2 and 3, there is a peak on the evaporating area curves \naround S=0.4 and 0.6, respectively. As the evaporating area of network 2 begin to reach its peak \nvalue the evaporating area of network 3 begin to drop fi-om its peak value. The cross of the two \ncurves take place near S=0.50. It was at this point that network 2 became to dry more rapidly \nthan network 3 as seen fi-om Fig. 5-2. This suggests that the evaporating area inside the network \nplays an important role in determining the velocity of the drying process.\n\nIt is well-known that the drying rate decreases rapidly with the receding evaporating fi-ont \ninto the porous medium. The evaporating area for network 3 reaches its peak value earlier than \nnetwork 2. It means that the evaporation rate on the drying fi-ont for network 3 at the peak point \nshould be higher than that of network 2. If the evaporating fi-ont recede uniformly, it should be \nnearer to the top for network 3 than for network 2 when the evaporating area reaches to the peak. \nAs a result, the peak evaporating area should have a greater influence on the drying process for \nnetwork 3. However, as seen fi-om Fig. 5-1, although with a lower evaporation network 2 dries \nmore rapidly than network 3. This cannot be reasoned only with information o f the evaporating \narea because Fig. 5-3 only gives the size of the evaporating fi-ont but not its location. To obtain \nthis information, liquid phase distribution maps are extracted during the drying simulation. From \nthese maps, one can locate the evaporating fi-ont at each drying step.\n\n5.1.4 Phase Distribution in the Network\n\nLiquid phase distribution maps for network 1-5 are given in the Fig. 5-4 ~ 8. From those \nmaps, the first thing to be noted is that the evaporating fi-ont is far fi-om being uniform, i.e., the \nevaporating fi-ont does not recede into the network as a flat surface. The form of the evaporating \nfi\u2019ont is very complex and different for the five networks. Even for the network 1 whose \nevaporating area oscillate less than other networks as seen in Fig. 5-3, the evaporating fi-ont is far\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d D iscussions S9\n\nS = 0.90\n\nS = 0.30\n\nS = 0.20\n\nS = 0.10\n\nFig. 5-4 Phase distribution for network 1\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults and Discussions 60\n\nS = 0.90 -\nS = 0.80\n\nW\u00ea\u00ea? \u00ea\u00ea\u00ea\u00ea? ^\u00ca\u00caM\nS = 0.70\n\ni\u00fc ^ \u00c9 \u00c9 l\nS = 0.60\n\nS = 0.50\n\nS = 0.40\n\nS = 0.30\n\nS = 0.20\n\nFig. 5-4 Phase distribution for network 2\n\n\n\nChapter 5 R esults an d Discussions 61\n\nS = 0.90\n\nS = 0.80\n\nm\nS= 0.70\n\nl ^ l l\n\n\u00c9 I \u00c9 ^\nS = 0.60\n\n\u00ca I\n\nS = 0.50\n\nl\u00cb\u00e2\nS = 0.40\n\nSiaii\n\nm.\u00c6\ni i L .\n\nS = 0.20\n\nS = 0.10\n\nFig. 5-4 Phase distribution for network 3\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults and Discussions 62\n\nS = 0.20\n\n'llllllj'?  hifii\nS = 0.10\n\nFig. 5-4 Phase distribution for network 4\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d  Discussions 63\n\nS = 0.90\n\nS = 0.30\n\ny .

Dry pitches at the begirming of the drying can be seen in the maps. With the \nreceding of the evaporating front away from the top, the form of the evaporating front become \nmore and more complex due to the appearance of more liquid clusters and the formation of some \nfrinicular drying zone.\n\nThe drying behaviors of network 2 and 3 can now be understood with the help of the \nliquid phase distribution maps. One can see that the top surface of network 1, 4 and 5 dried more \nrapidly than that of network 2 and 3. Their top surface are completely dried soon after S=0.70. \nFor network 3, the top surface became completely dry only after S=0.60. For network 2, there is \na liquid cluster on the top surface and it is completely dry only after S=0.40. The evaporating area \nof network 2 reached its peak value for S=0.40 because, the evaporation rate on the front kept a \nrelatively high value due to this liquid cluster. This explains why network 2 dried more rapidly \nthan network 3 even for later tunes. At a saturation of S=0.4, the evaporating front of network 2 \nis nearer the interface than that of network 3. With a higher evaporation rate on the evaporating \nfront and a larger evaporating area, network 2 dries more rapidly than the other networks.\n\nFrom the liquid phase distribution maps, one can understand why the evaporating area \ndecreases after S=0.30 for all networks. Funicular drying zones reaches the bottom edge of the \nnetworks near S=0.30, and the edge effect takes place. In other words, the evaporating front is \nlimited to develop its form freely. The edge effect reduces the clusters in the network and, \nconsequently, the evaporating area.\n\nThe drying rate presented in Fig. 5-2, in fact, is a combination of the evaporation rate on \nthe evaporating front and the area o f the evaporating front. To illustrate the mass transfer at the \ntop surface of the porous medium during different stages of simulation, local evaporation rate for \nnetwork 2 and 3 are shown in Fig. 5-9 and Fig. 5-10.\n\n5.1.5 Local Mass Fluxes at the Top Surface\n\nFrom Fig. 5-9, it is found that the local mass fluxes of the vapor at the top surface \ndecreases sharply after this surface is dried. The vapor fluxes at the wet surface is ahnost ten \ntimes bigger than the vapor fluxes at the dry surface. The mass fluxes at the top surface decrease \nwith the receding evaporating front. For network 2, the wet pitch at the top surface maintain the \nglobal mass flux at a relatively high value. Going back to the drying rate curves in Fig. 5-2, one \ncan observe that the drying rate curves for network 1, 2 and 3 have a feature that network 4 and 5 \ndo not have. For the formers, the drying rate decreases rapidly at the very begirming of drying and \nthen keeps ahnost constant at a certain value. Then the drying rate drops sharply again to a lower\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d  Discussions 65\n\n4E-3\n\n3E-3 -  \n\n2E-3 -  \n\n1E-3 -  \n\nOE+0 -\n\n11\n\" \u2014  n nn\n\nV V V / U \u00a5 IHJU\n\n4E-3\n\n?\nS = 0.90 S = 0.50\n\n? iiliiiiillB llil\nS = 0.70 S = 0.30\n\n4E-3\n\n3E-3\n\nOE+0\n\n-\n\nS = 0.60 S = 0.20\n\nFig. 5-9 Local mass flux profiles at the top surface fiar network 2 (with Kelvin effect)\n\n\n\nC h a p te rs Results and Discussions 66\n\n4E-3\n\nw\nE\no>\n\ns\n3M\nQ.\n2\n(D\n\n(0\nX3\n\nO\ns\na\n5\n\nLU\n\nS = 0.90\n\n4E-3\n\n3E-3 -  \n\n2\u00ca-3 \n\nIE-3 \n\nOE+0\n\nS = 0.80\n\nS= 0.70\n\n?\n\nu\n1\n\ni U\n\n3E-4\n\n2E-4 -\n\nIE-4 -\n\nOE+0\n\n3E-4\n\n2E-4 -\n\n1E-4\n\nOE+0\n\nS = 0.50\n\nS = 0.40\n\nS = 0.30\n\nS = 0.60\n\nFig. 5-10 Local mass flux profiles at the top surface for network 3 (with Kelvin effect)\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults and Discussions 67\n\nvalue at given saturation value. This saturation value where the second drop in the drying rate \ntakes place, in agreement with Figs. 5-4 ~ 8 and 5-9 ~ 10, is exactly the value where the top \nsurface becomes totally dried. The constant drying rate after the first drop for network 1, 2 and 3 \nis different than the one that occurred earlier, which is determined by the wet area o f the top \nsurface. The larger the wet area, the higher the global mass flux at the top surface. On other hand, \nthe longer the top surface keeps wet, the longer the constant drying rate period is.\n\nFor network 4 and 5, the second drop in the drying rate is not as clear as that for other \nnetworks. From Fig. 5-7 and Fig. 5-8, one can find that the top surface becomes totally dried very \nquickly (before S=0.7). Their drying curves, thus, are smoother than that o f other networks.\n\nIt is worthy mentioning here that evaporation-condensation mechanisms were observed \nduring all simulations, i.e., some clusters have a negative global evaporation rate around their \nborder, although in a somewhat low extent. This was not reported by Prat (1993) because the \nKelvin effect was not included m his drying model, i.e., all gas-liquid interface in his network are \ntaken to be plane.\n\nMotivated by the existence of evaporation-condensation inside the network Kelvin effect \nwill now be explored.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results and Discussions 68\n\n5.2 In f l u e n c e  o f  th e Ke l v in  E f f e c t  o n  t h e  D r y in g  K in e t i c s\n\nThe difference caused by the Kelvin effect, in terms of the driving force for vapor \ndiffusion, i.e., the partial pressure of the vapor at the gas-liquid interface, is very small. According \nto the Kelvin's equation, the partial pressure of the vapor at a concave meniscus is lower than the \npartial pressure at a flat interface. The difference of the partial pressure increases with the \ndecreasing meniscus radius. The variation of partial pressure of alcohol vapor with the meniscus \nradius is given in Fig. 5-11.\n\nOne can find that the difference o f the partial pressure between a flat interface (Pq) and a \nmeniscus (Pj.) is very small for meniscus radius bigger than 0.1 iim. The size of pores and throats \nused in our network is much bigger than 0.1 jim, and, therefore, the Kelvin effect with regard to \nthe driving force for vapor diffusion, can be neglected. However, for a drying model in which the \ngas-liquid interface is taken to be flat, the partial pressure of vapor at the gas-liquid interface in \nthe network is uniform. In other words, vapor condensation, as have been reported by Prat \n(1993), can not take place at these interfaces because the vapor partial pressure at the interface is \nalways the highest inside the network. For a drying model in which the gas-liquid interface has a \ncertain curvature, although the difference of the saturated partial pressure at the interface caused \nby the difference of the curvature is very small, the condensation o f vapor in the network, as have \nbeen observed in the simulations, can take place during the drying sunulation. The interesting \npoint is to investigate which role the condensation-evaporation mechanism plays during the \nsimulation.\n\nO.OE+O 2.0E-7 4.0E-7 6.0E-7 8.0E-7 1.0E-6 \nCurvature radius (nn)\n\nFig. 5-11 Variation of partial pressure with curvature radius\n\n\n\nChapter 5 R esults an d Discussions 69\n\nTo Study the Kelvin effect on the drying kinetics, two drying models are used to simulate \nthe drying behavior for the same network. One drying model takes into account the Kelvin effect \n(the gas-liquid interfaces have curvature) and the other takes the gas-liquid interfaces as flat. The \nfive networks used here are the same of those used in the last section. The simulations are carried \nout under the same conditions o f the last section. Again, the external flow is not considered.\n\n5.2.1 Drying Kinetics\n\nThe drying curves for the five networks using the two different drying models are \npresented in Figs. 5-12 - 1 6 . The first evidence that can be observed fi'om these figures is that the \nKelvin effect has a different influence on a different network. For network 1 and 2, the difference \nin drymg time caused by the Kelvin effect is much larger than that for network 3, 4 and 5. The \ndifference in drying time can reach more than 20% (for network 1) or less than 2% (for network \n4). For all networks used here, the drying tune for the two models is practically the same for \nS>0.7. Deviations take place near S=0.50. After this point, the drying curves for the two models \nseparate one fi-om the other.\n\nDrying Time (hours)\n\nFig. 5-12 Drying curve for network 1\n\nDrying Time (hours)\n\nFig. 5-13 Drying curve for network 2\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esu lts and Discussions 70\n\nDrying Time (hours)\n\nFig. 5-14 Drying curve for network 3\n\nDrying Time (hours)\n\nFig. 5-15 Drying curve for network 4\n\nDrying Time (hours)\n\nFig. 5-16 Drying curve for network 5\n\nThe second evidence, which is more interest, is that the Kelvin effect can cause either a \npositive influence (accelerating the drying process) or a negative influence (reducing the drying \nprocess). This is somehow strange because, as one usually would expect, the Kelvin effect should \nalways reduce the drying. For the two drying models used here, the boundary condition imposed \non the top edge of the network is the same, i.e., the mass fraction of alcohol vapor is the zero. For \nthe model which takes Kelvin effect into account, the saturated partial pressure of alcohol vapor\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d  Discussions 71\n\nat the gas-liquid interface inside the network is lower than that of the model which do not \nconsider the Kelvin effect and should slow the drying process. However, one can find, from Figs. \n5-12 ~ 16, that the effect on network 1 and 5 (positive effect) is different than that on the network\n2, 3 and 4 (negative effect). As have been explained before, the negative effect is easy to \nunderstand. Otherwise, the positive effect can not be explained only by the difference of the \nsaturated partial pressure at the gas-liquid interface in the network. More detailed information \ninside the network are needed to explain why for some networks reducing the vapor pressure at \nthe gas-liquid interface can accelerate the drying.\n\n5.2.2 Drying Rate\n\nThe drying rate curves for the five networks are presented in Figs. 5 - 1 7 - 2 1 . It can be \nseen that the difference of drying rate coincides with the difference o f the drying time caused by \nthe Kelvin effect. For network 1 and 2, the difference in drying curves obtained by using the two \ndrying models is large, as seen from Figs. 5-12 and 5-13; the same occurs for the drying rate \naccording to Figs. 5-17 and 5-18. For network 3, 4 and 5, the difference in the drying rate curves \ndue to the Kelvin effect is small. The drying rate curves for the model without the Kelvin effect \nhave the same characteristics of the drying rate curves for the model with the Kelvin effect, that \nis, the drying rate decreases rapidly to a certain value and then this value is maintained for a \nperiod. For network 1, 2 and 3, the second drop in the drying rate occurs for both models, \nwhereas for network 4 and 5 the second drop is not clear on the drying rate curves. The \noccurrence of the second drop in the drying rate which indicates the moment, as have been \ndiscussed before, that the interface becomes totally dried, is not at the same saturation for the two \ndifferent models. For network 1 (Fig. 5-17), the second drop on the solid line (with Kelvin effect) \noccurs earlier than that on the dashed line (without Kelvin effect), i.e., the interface dries more \nrapidly by using the model with Kelvin effect than by using the model without Kelvin effect. This \nimplies that the liquid phase distribution is different during the simulation for the same network \ndepending whether Kelvin effect is included or not.\n\nDifferent than what was observed for network 1, for network 2 the second drop in the \ndrying rate with Kelvin effect takes place later than without Kelvin effect. It means that the top \nsurface kept partially wetted for a longer tune by using the model with Kelvm effect. As have \nbeen discussed in the last section, the wetted surface has a much higher evaporation rate than the \ndried surface. This difference o f evaporation rate at the top surface has a stronger influence on the \ndrying kinetics than the difference of the saturated partial pressure caused by the curvature. As a \nresuk of the wet surface, the network dries more rapidly by usmg the model with Kelvin effect.\n\n\n\nC hapter 5 R esults a n d  Discussions 72\n\nSaturation, S Saturation, S\n\nFig. 5-17 Drying rate curve for network 1 Fig. 5-18 Drying rate curve for network 2\n\n\u2022o\n\n0.60\n\n0 .5 0 -\n\n0 .4 0 -\n\n0.30\nB ro \na:\no, 0.20 H \ng\n\nQ 0.10-^\n\n-  I\nt\n\\\n\nwith Kelvin effect \n\nwithout Kelvin effect\n\n0.00\n\ns\n\nBro\na:\nO)\u00c7\nS'\n\n1  ?

However, the dashed line maintain a lower value of drying rate after the first \ndrop. This might be caused by the evaporating fi-ont area or the evaporating fi-ont position in the \nnetwork.\n\nThere is almost no difference on the drying rate curves for network 4 and 5.\n\n5.2.3 Evaporating Area in the Networli\n\nThe evaporating area for the five networks are plotted in the Figs. 5-22 ~ 26. It can be \nobserved again that the curves of the evaporating area are very affected by the network. For \nnetwork 1, around S=0.4 there is a peak on the curve for evaporating area when the Kelvin effect \nis absent while no peak is observed when the Kelvin effect is present. Contrarily, for network 2, \nthe absence of the Kelvin effect cause the disappearance of the peak on the evaporating area \ncurve. For network 3, 4 and 5, the curves of the evaporating area have the same feature for both \nmodels. From these figures, one can see that the evaporating area can be used to explain the \ndrying times observed in Figs. 5-12 to 5-16. For networks 1 and 5 the drying times in absence of \nthe Kelvin effect is shorter than those with Kelvin effect and the corresponding evaporating areas \nare larger. Also, for networks 2 and 3 the shorter drymg times observed with the Kelvin effect is \nin agreement with the larger evaporating areas. However, for network 4, in spite of the larger \nevaporating area observed in presence of Kelvin effect, the drying time is virtually unaffected by\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d  D iscussions 74\n\nthe Kelvin effect as seen from Fig. 5-15.

Figs. 5-4 \n~ 8 are presented again to facilitate the comparison o f liquid distribution for the same network \nobtained by using the two different drying model. One can see that liquid is distributed differently \nfor the same network at the same saturation. This means that the Kelvin effect changed the drying \npath in the network. For network 1 (Fig. 5-4 and Fig. 5-27), the liquid distribution in the network \nis somewhat similar before S=0.70. After S=0.70, in Fig. 5-4 (with Kelvin effect), the evaporating \nfront receded from the top surface, thus, as have been discussed in last section, resulting a sharp \ndecrease o f evaporation fluxes. In Fig. 5-27 (without Kelvin effect), there is some Uquid near the \ntop surface until S=0.50. This keeps the evaporation fluxes at the top surface at a relatively high \nvalue, accelerating the drying process.\n\nFor network 2 (Fig. 5-5 and Fig. 5-28), what happened is contrary to that observed for \nnetwork 1. In Fig. 5-5, the top surface became totally dry only after S==0.40. In Fig. 5-28, the \ninterface was dried soon after S=0.60. The mfluence o f Kelvin effect on the drying kinetics caused \nby the difference o f liquid phase distribution is much stronger than that caused by the difference in \nsaturated pressure at the gas-liquid interface. As a result, the network dries slowly even in the \nabsence o f the Kelvin effect. This also explained the drying behavior of network 3.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results an d  D iscussions 76\n\nS = 0.90\n\nS = 0.20\n\n.

The Kelvin effect \nhas a strong or weak influence, depending on the network and on the maimer the drying path \naffects the kinetics (in fact, the phase distribution). This influence can be on increasing or \ndecreasing the drying rate.\n\nAt this point one can go back to Figs. 5-15 and 5-25 and try to understand why the drying \ntime for network 4 was unaffected by the presence of Kelvin effect in spite of the influence of \nKelvin effect on the evaporating area as seen from Fig. 5-25.\n\nFirst it should be observed that for network 2 and S=0.5 the evaporating area without \nKelvin effect is larger than that with Kelvin effect. However, as shown by Figs. 5-15 and 5-28 for \nS=0.5, with Kelvin effect the top surface has wet patches contrary to the top surface without \nKelvin effect which is totally dry. Thus, even through with Kelvin effect the evaporating area is \nsmaller than that without Kelvin effect, the drying rate for network 2 at S=0.5 is higher for the \nformer (with Kelvin effect) than for the latter (without Kelvin effect). This findmg evidences that \nthe drying rate is affected by both the evaporating area and the resistance for the vapor diffusion \nfrom the gas-liquid interface to the top surface.\n\nFor network 4 with Kelvin effect, the evaporating area might be larger than that without \nKelvin effect but the resistance for the vapor diffusion is smaller due to the phase distribution \ninside the network. The combination o f both effects, evaporating area and vapor diffiision \nresistance yields drying rate for network 4 that is unaffected by the presence or not of Kelvin \neffect as is observed in Figs. 5-15 and 5-20.\n\n\n\nC hapter 5 R esu lts an d  Discussions 82\n\n5.3 S t a b i l it y  o f  t h e  E v a p o r a t in g  Fr o n t\n\nThe stability of the evaporating front, as has been pointed out by Prat (1993), is important \nfrom the point o f view of the validity of the continuum or macroscopic approach. If the \ncontinuum approach is valid with the porous medium, the evaporating front should be relatively \nstable during the drying process because the porous medium is usually assumed to be isotropic, i. \ne., the properties o f the porous medium such as porosity, conductivity and permeability has the \nsame value in any direction, at least at the scale o f the representative elementary volume (R.E. V).\n\nFrom the phase distribution maps of all simulations, three main regions can be observed \nduring the drying process (Fig. 5-32):\n\nFig. 5-32 Three mam regions in term of phase distribution\n\nDry region\nThere is no liquid in this region. The vapor is transported in the gaseous phase by \nvapor diffusion.\n\nUnsaturated region\nThere are some temporary trapped liquid clusters where the liquid transport is the \nresult o f a complex interaction between liquid transport within the trapped clusters \nand vapor diffiision in the surrounding gaseous phase. The evaporation-condensation \nmechanism (liquid bridge) takes place in this region.\n\nSaturated region\nThe liquid transport occurs in the liquid phase due to capillary force.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esu lts a n d  D iscussions 83\n\nIn fact, the evaporatmg front is formed by the evaporating throats on the border of the \nclusters. Its shape is quite complicated. Strictly speaking, there is an evaporating surface \nsurrounding each temporary trapped cluster. In other words, the evaporating front is not a \ncontinuous surface but a region consisting of many separated evaporating surface. The term \n\"evaporating front\" used here is associated with the unsaturated region. The stability of \nevaporating front, therefore, refers to the stability (the relative depth) of this region.\n\nSome fingering occurs after the evaporating front receded from the top surface. Although \nthose fingering do not reach to the sample size, the evaporating front is far from being flat as \nassumed in many drying models encountered in the literature. The depth o f the evaporating front \nregion (unsaturated region) tends to increase while the evaporating front recede from the top \nsurface. One can find also that the number of trapped clusters increase as drying proceeds. Some \nexample of the variation of the temporary trapped cluster number during the drying simulation are \ngiven in Fig. 5-33 and 5-34. It is clearly shown in the figures that the trapped cluster number \nincrease rapidly with decreasing saturation. The trapped cluster number decrease at the end of \ndrying because o f the bottom edge effect, as have been discussed before.\n\nSimilar phenomena have been observed by Masmoudi et al. (1992) and Prat (1993) in their \nexperimental and numerical works. In the paper of Masmoudi et al., the liquid phase distribution \nwas obtained using a transparent etched network (for more detail, one can refer to Lenormand et \nal., 1988). The liquid phase distribution in the network was photographed during the drying \nprocess. The influence o f gravity on the cluster size and on their number in the network was \ninvestigated by Masmoudi et al. and it was found that the shape of the evaporating front is fractal, \nand that depth o f the evaporating (invasion front, in that paper) depends clearly on the Bond \nnumber which is defined as\n\na\n\nwhere Ap represents the density difference between the displacing and displaced fluids, the t is a \ntypical pore size diameter and the o  is the interfacial tension. Their experimental results show that \nthe number and the maximum size of the clusters tend to increase as Bond number decrease.\n\nOne interesting feature observed by Masmoundi et al. is the relative stability of the \ninvasion front (cluster region). This stability is observed in the experiments with the micromodel \nwhen the gravity forces are not negligible. Such a stability is also observed in the numerical \nsimulation results o f Prat (1993). As have been pointed out by Prat in his paper, the front stability \ncould be explained in terms of the removal mechanism of the clusters through the action of\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results an d  Discussions 84\n\nevaporation. In fact, there is no permanent trapped cluster in the network during the drying \nprocess. The small trapped clusters can be eliminated soon due to evaporation.\n\nSaturation Saturation\n\nFig. 5-33 Total cluster number and condensing Fig. 5-34 Total cluster number and condensing \ncluster number in the network 2 during drying cluster number in the network 3 during drying\n\nOne can find also, fi\"om the present simulation, that the depth of the evaporating front tend \nto increase while the evaporatmg front receded from the interface. According to Masmoudi et al., \nthe reason for the increasing of the evaporating front depth should be associated with the \ndecreasing of the evaporation rate in terms of a diminished power for the evaporation process \n(together with the diffusion process of vapor in the gaseous phase) to eliminate or erode the \ncluster.\n\nThe sharp decrease of the evaporation rate at the top surface after it becomes totally dry \nhas been shown clearly in the present simulation. The present author agree with the explanation of \nMasmoudi et al. about the increasing of evaporating front depth. However, the evaporation- \ncondensation mechanism was not concerned in their discussion. In the present author's opinion, \nthe reducing of the evaporation process power is an important effect, but not the unique reason. \nThe other reason for the increasing of the evaporating front depth, is the temporary condensing \nclusters. It has been confirmed in the present simulation that the evaporation-condensation \nmechanism takes place during the drying process. As have been shown in Fig. 5-33 and 5-34, the \ntotal cluster number and the condensing cluster number increase with the receding evaporating\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results and D iscussions 8S\n\nfront. The condensing clusters can not be eliminated in the network until they become evaporating \nones. As a resuh, the evaporating front depth increase.\n\nThe place of condensing clusters in the network during the simulation process are given in \nFig. 5-35 and 36. In these figures, the evaporating clusters are printed black and the condensing \nclusters red. One can see that the condensing clusters are always at the place where is surrounded \nby other clusters. There is no permanent condensing cluster in the network during the simulation, \ni.e., the cluster could be a condensing one in one drying time interval and become evaporating one \nin next drying time interval. As have been observed, the condensing clusters exist only when the \nplace is surrounded by other evaporating clusters. Once after the place is open due to the \nelimination of some evaporating clusters around it, the condensing clusters change to be \nevaporating clusters and can be eliminated as time advances.\n\nIt should be reminded that gravity has not been taken into account in the present drying \nmodel. Generally, gravity becomes negligible when the pore size is small enough, that is, the \ncapillary force is large enough comparing to the gravity force difference caused by the pores \nlocation in the network. In fact, the height of network used here is only 1.2 cm and the pore size \nrange is 39 ~ 250 pun. The gravity force is not important for simulation.\n\nIn the paper of Masmoudi et al., the stability of the invasion front was discussed in terms \nof gravity by considering only the typical pore size (Bond number). It should be noted that the \npore size distribution range has a great influence on the stability o f evaporating front. Generally \nspeaking, for a network with a narrow pore size range, the evaporating front shoiild be more \nstable due to the small difference of capillary force. As an extreme example, the evaporating front \nshould be flat for a network with an uniform pore size.\n\nThe experimental resuhs of Masmoudi et al. (1992) were obtained using a network \ncontaining about 10000 ducts with seven classes o f width (from 0.1 ~ 0.6 mm) distributed at \nrandom; gravity is not negligible for these pores. The network used in the present simulation has \nten classes of pore and throat size. For a real porous medium, however, the pore size distribution \nrange is quite large. The material used to obtain the pore size distribution in the present work, for \nexample, has a pore size ranging from 5.0 to 170 |im. It can be expected that the evaporating \nfront in a real porous medium should be wider than those observed here.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results and Discussions 86\n\nS = 0.90 S = 0.90\n\nS = 0.10 S = 0.10\n\nFig. 5-35 Place o f condensing clusters Fig. 5-36 Place of condensing clusters \nin network 2 during the drying simulation in network 3 during the drying simulation\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esu lts and Discussions 87\n\n5 .4  In f l u e n c e  o f  t h e Ex t e r n a l  A i r  Fl o w\n\nThe complete configuration sketched in Fig. 2-1 will now be considered. In practice, the \nporous medium is dried by a hot dry (or moist) air flow. Under this circumstance, an external dry \nair flow is imposed on the surface o f the porous medium. Generally speaking, the external flow \nshould increase the mass transfer coefBcient at the interface between the external flow and the \nporous medium. However, as have been mentioned before in chapter 2, the drying behavior at the \ninterface between the external flow and the porous medium is still unclear. It is interesting, \ntherefore, to  study the influence of the external flow on the mass transfer at the interface.\n\nuniform grid 100x20 \nexternal flow domain\n\n- . network 100x20 \n' porous medium domain\n\nA\n3 mm\n\n12 mm\n\n1 .\n\nO -\n60 mm\n\n- O\n\nFig. 5-37 Solution domain and the geometrical size\n\nThe solution domain to be used in the numerical calculation is presented in Fig. 5-37. The \ngeometrical size of the domain is as shown in the figure. The network used to represent the \nporous medium is the same of section 5.2 and 5.3 (100x20). To facilitate the coupling of the \nexternal flow with the porous medium, an uniform 100x20 grid is used for the external flow \ndomain. Thus, each throat is coupled with one control volume at the interface. Both network and \nexternal flow grids have an unity thickness. It is not necessary, therefore, to convert the throat \nsurface at the interface. It should be pointed out that the main focus here is not on the numerical \naccuracy o f  the phenomenon that is being modeled. Instead a general description of the drying \nkinetics is being sought. For a more representative simulation in which quantitative agreement \nwith experiments is needed a more refined grid is required.\n\nThe simulation conditions for porous medium are the same of the last section. The inlet \nvelocity o f the external flow is assumed to be uniform and the inlet mass fi'action of alcohol vapor \nis zero. The velocity field is obtained by solving the differential equations (2-1) and (2-2) under \nthe assumption o f no-slip condition at the interface. Considering that the evaporation rate at the \ninterface is not very high, the obtained velocity field is used for the whole simulation without\n\n\n\nC h apter 5 R esu lts an d Discussions 88\n\nupdating it, that is, the quantity o f the evaporated alcohol vapor from the porous medium is \nassumed to be small enough to not influence the velocity field. This can save the computation time \nsignificantly and, as explored by Prata and Sparrow (1987) in a somehow similar problem, has a \nnegUgible effect on both the flow field and the evaporation rate. After the velocity field is \ncalculated, the moisture field is obtained by solving the differential equation (2-3) with the \nprescribed evaporation rate at the interface. The moisture field is updated for each drying time \ninterval with the updated evaporation rate at the interface. The procedure of the alcohol removal \nfrom the network is the same of that described in last section. The drying simulation is made on \nnetwork 1 for the inlet velocity of 1 ~ 50 m/s, and for the aforegiven parameters the flow is \nlaminar.\n\n5.4.1 Drying Kinetics\n\nThe drying kinetics curves for inlet velocity of 1 ~ 50 m/s is presented in Fig. 5-38. One \ncan see that the difference of drying time caused by the external flow is small. The difference of \nthe total drying time is not larger than 10%. Just as have been observed in the results of the phase \ndistribution, the drying curves begin to deviate one from the other at the very begirming o f drying \nuntil S=0.60. The maximum difference o f drying time can reach 50% (between U=1.0 and 50.0 \nm/s). After the saturation of S=0.60, the deviation stops developing and the drying time curves \nfor the various inlet velocities become almost the same.\n\nIt is surprising to observe that the relationship between the drying time and the inlet \nvelocity is not monotonie. The network dries fastest when the inlet velocity is U=10.0 m/s and the \ntotal drying time for U=5 .0 m/s is larger than that for U=3 .0 m/s. This is, of course, unexpected \nfrom the point of view of the continuum approach. One can note that the drying curves become \nnearly parallel while the saturation equals to about 0.60. To have a better look at the beginning of \nthe drying process. Figs. 5-39 ,40 and 41 were prepared.\n\nIt is observed from Figs. 5-39 to 41 that for S > 0.7, the drying time decreases as the inlet \nvelocity increases, as expected. This evidences the external flow influence on the drying kinetics \nduring this period. Also noted from the figures is that the influence of external flow decreases \nwith increasing inlet velocity. That is, the impact on drying of an increase of the inlet velocity \ndiminishes as the inlet velocity increases. One can see that near the S=0.65, drying is accelerated \nfor U=7.0 and 10.0 m/s and the corresponding curves for these inlet velocities cross the curve for \nU=50.0 m/s. In especial, the curve for U=7.0 m/s crosses the curve for U=50.0 m/s four times. It \nbecomes to dry more quickly than U=50.0 m/s near S=0.65 and back to dry more slowly near \nS=0.50. It becomes to dry faster again at S=0.25 and to dry slower near S=0.20. Also worth\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esu lts a n d  D iscussions 89\n\nnoting is that close to S=0.25 the curve for 5.0 m/s that was yielding drying times smaller than \nthose of U=3.0 m/s crosses it and starts to dry more slowly. Those findings will be discussed with \nthe results for the evaporating area.\n\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 \nDrying Time (hours)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0\nDrying Time (hours)\n\n1.5\n\nFig 5-38 Drying curves for various \ninlet velocity o f external flow\n\nFig. 5-39 Drymg curves of beginning part \nfor various inlet velocity\n\nDrying Time (hours) Drying Time (hours)\n\nFig. 5-40 Drying curves of middle part \nfor various inlet velocity\n\nFig. 5-41 Drying curves o f latter part \nfor various inlet velocity\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results and Discussions 90\n\n5.4.2 Drying Rate\n\nThe drying rate curves shown in Fig. 5-42 is, as also presented in the last section, the \ndrying time derivative of saturation (dS/dt) versus saturation. It can been found that the difference \no f drying rate caused by the external flow velocity occurs before saturation reaches the 0.60 \nvalue. The maximum difference on the drying rate takes place at the initial of drying. This \ndifference decreases with the reducing saturation. A second drop in the drying rate can been \nobserved for all inlet velocities investigated. From Fig. 5-43, one can find that the second fall in \ndrying rate occurs between S=0.70 and 0.60. As have been discussed in the last section, this point \nindicates the moment that the top surface becomes totally dry. The second drop takes place at \nsmaller saturation for U=10.0 m/s than for the others velocities. This coincides with the drying \nkinetics where the network dries most quickly for U=10.0 m/s than for the others velocities. After \nthe second fall, the drying rate for all cases tend to be the same. This indicates that the external \nflow has influence on the drying kinetics only when the top surface is totally or partially wetted. \nFor a dry surface the mtemal vapor diffusion resistance overcomes the external convective \nresistance, and becomes the dominant mechanism for drying.\n\nSaturation, S Saturation, S\n\nFig. 5-42 Drying rate curves for various \ninlet velocity of external flow\n\nFig. 5-43 Drying rate curves for various \ninlet velocity o f external flow\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esu lts an d Discussions 91\n\n5.4.3 Evaporating Area in Network\n\nThe evaporating area inside the network, from which the information of evaporating front \ncan be obtained, is plotted in Fig. 5-44. It is found that the evaporating area for all inlet velocities \ninvestigated has the same overall pattern. The evaporating area at the very beginning is the same \nfor all inlet velocities since this area is exactly the wet area when the top surface is saturated. As \nthe same network is used for all velocities, the wet area of top surface is the same. The \nevaporating area increase with the decreasing saturation until the first peak is reached. It can be \nalso seen that the peak value and the corresponding saturation peak value is different for various \ninlet velocities. The evaporating area decreases after this point since all the evaporating front \nbegin to recede from the top surface, as a result, the evaporating front becomes flatter. The first \npeak point corresponds to the moment that the top surface becomes totally dry. The second peak \nof evaporating area is believed to be caused by the formation of more trapped clusters in the \nnetwork. The evaporating area during the simulation for each inlet velocity is different. This \nsuggests an influence of the inlet velocity on the phase distribution in the network. Attention will \nbe returned to this matter in section 5.4.6.\n\nA carefiil examination of Fig. 5-44 indicates that the curve for U=7.0 m/s crosses the \ncurve for U=50.0 m/s four times, just as have been observed in Fig. 5-38. The first peak for \nU=7.0 m/s occurs later and is higher than U=50.0 m/s, corresponding to the first cross in which \nU=7.0 m/s becomes to dry more quickly than U=50.0 m/s. The second peak takes place on the \ncurve for U=50.0 m/s during S=0.60 ~ 0.40 resulting in a faster drying while no peak is observed \non the curve for U=7.0 m/s. The evaporating area for U=7.0 m/s becomes higher than that for \nU=50.0 m/s near S=0.40 and lower agaui near S=0.20, corresponding to the other two cross of \nthe drying curves, as mentioned before. It is worth noting that although the evaporating area for \nU=7.0 m/s is not much higher than that for U=50.0 m/s, considering the large inlet velocity \ndifference, the case for U=7.0 m/s succeeds in drying faster than U=50.0 m/s during S=0.40 ~ \n0.20, indicating that the external flow influence is weak during the latter drying period.\n\nThe variation of the wet area percentage of the top surface with the saturation is presented \nin Fig. 5-45 to show the moment that the top surface becomes totally dried. It can be seen that the \nvariation o f wet area percentage of the top surface with the saturation is almost the same for all \ninlet velocities. The top surface dries quickly at the very beginning and only 5 .0% o f top surface is \nwetted when S=0.90. The top surface approximately maintains this percentage of wet area until \nS=0.65. Recalling what have been observed on the drying rate curves, the drying rate decreases \nsharply before S > 0.90 and then becomes almost constant until the second drop. To show more \nclearly how the wet area percentage at the top surface approaches zero. Fig. 5-46 was prepared. \nIt should be noted that the curve for U=50.0 m/s is overlapped on the curve of U=1.0 m/s. It can\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d  D iscussions 92\n\nbe seen that the sequence that the top surface becomes totally dry coincides with the sequence of \nsecond drop in drying rate in Fig. 5-43 and the first peak point of evaporating area in Fig. 5-44.\n\n\u201c 1\u2014 \u2014?

The local mass fluxes at the top surface during the \ndrying process are important in studying the influence of dry patches on the drying kinetics, and in \nexploring the influence of the surface saturation on the mass transfer coeflBcient. In applying the \ncontinuum approach to predict drying of unsaturated porous medium much debate has appeared \nin the literature concerning the variation of the local Sherwood number on the top surface and the \nvalidity of the analogy between heat and mass transfer (see for example, Lee et al., 1992, Rogers \nand Kaviany, 1990, Tao and Kaviany, 1989 and Chen and Pei, 1989). To shed some Ught into this \nissue, the local mass fluxes at the top surface for some cases at certain saturations are presented in \nFig. 5-47 ~ 49. The inlet velocity of the external flow is 1, 5 and 10 m/s, respectively.\n\nFrom these figures, one can see the influence of the external flow on the mass fluxes along \nthe top surface. The local mass fluxes profiles are different from those presented in Fig. 5-9 and \n10, where the mass fraction of alcohol vapor at the top surface was taken to be zero, and as a \nresult, the local mass fluxes of the wetted interface was uniform. With an external flow over the \nsurface of the porous medium, the local mass fluxes of the wetted top surface decrease \ndownstream. This mass fluxes profile is expected and follows the typical mass transfer pattern \nobserved from a boundary layer over a flat surface (Kays and Crawford, 1993). The mass fraction \no f alcohol vapor at the entrance of the external flow domain is zero, and the evaporation rate at \nthe wetted surface is highest. The evaporated alcohol vapor is carried downstream in the domain \nresulting in an alcohol laden air along the top surface, decreasing the evaporating rate. As can \nbeen observed from the figures the boundary layer effect has virtually no influence on the \nevaporation flux when the top surface is no longer wet. Once again, the difference of mass fluxes \nfor wetted and dry top surface is very large.\n\nAfter the top surface have been dried, the external flow has a weak influence on the mass \nfluxes profile. Contrary to the wetted surface, the local mass fluxes downstream can be higher \nthan that upstream. This is so because for a dry top surface the mass flux is more affected by the \nresistance to vapor diffusion inside the network, as explored before.\n\nA careflil examination of the phase distribution maps and the corresponding local mass \nfluxes at the top surface indicate the influence of the external flow, in spite of its weakness, after \nthe top surface have been dried. From Fig. 5-43, one can find that, at the latter periods of drying, \nthe mass flux upstream can be higher than that downstream, considering the large distance \nbetween the evaporating front and the top surface.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esu lts a n d  Discussions 94\n\n1.2E-2 \n\n9.0E-3 -  \n\n6.0E-3 -  \n\n3.0E-3 -  \n\nO.OE+0 -\n\nS = 0.90\n\nu \u00dc\n\n4.0E-4\n\nS = 0.50\n\n1.2E-2\n\n9.0E-3 -\n\n6.0E-3 -\n\n3.0E-3\n\nO.OE+0\n\nO.OE+0\n\nS = 0 .8 0\n\n4.0E-4\n\nS = 0.40\n\nS = 0.70 S = 0.30\n\nS = 0.60 S = 0.20\n\nFig. 5-47 Local mass flux profiles at the top surface for U=1.0 m/s\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d D iscussions 95\n\n1.2E-2 \n\n1.0E-2 -  \n\n8.0E-3 \n\n6.0E-3 -  \n\n4.0E-3 -  \n\n2.0E-3 -  \n\n0.0E-K3 -\n\n......... - -\n\nu V\n\nS = 0.90 S = 0.50\n\nS = 0.80 S = 0.40\n\nS = 0.60 S = 0.20\n\nFig. 5-48 Local mass flux profiles at the top surface for U=5.0 m/s\n\n\n\nChapter 5 R esu lts and Discussions 96\n\nS = 0.90 S = 0.50\n\n4.0E-4\n\n3.0E-4 -\n\n2.0E-4 -\n\n1.0E-4 -\n\nO.OE+0\n\nS = 0.80 S = 0.40\n\n1.2E-2 \n\n1.0E-2 -  \n\n8.0E-3 -  \n\n6.0E-3 \n\n4.0E-3 -  \n\n2.0E-3 -  \n\nO.OE+0\n\n4.0E-4\n\nS = 0.70 S = 0.30\n\nS = 0.60 S = 0.20\n\nFig. 5-49 Local mass flux profiles at the top surface for U=10.0 m/s\n\n\n\nChapter 5 Results and Discussions 97\n\nOther interesting finding extracted fi-om Fig, 5-47 ~ 49 is that the mass fluxes profiles at \nthe top surface for latter drying periods (S &lt;0.30) are ahnost the same for the three different inlet \nvelocities, even though the evaporating fi-onts in the network have different shapes. As have been \ndiscussed before, the evaporating front in the network during the drying process is far from being \nflat. This heterogeneity in the evaporating front has a strong influence on the mass fluxes at the \ntop surface while the top surface is totally or partially wet. This influence reduces with the \nreceding evaporating front from top surface. From what are observed here, it seems that the \nheterogeneity of evaporating front is no longer important for latter drying periods. Recalling that \nthe present network has only a depth of 1.2 cm, this finding suggests that from the point of view \nof the validity o f the continuum approach, the stability o f evaporating front is not so important as \none might think, once the top surface has been totally dried.\n\nAt high saturation, comparing the mass fluxes profiles at the top surface for different inlet \nvelocities, one can find that the difference in the mass fluxes caused by the external flow decrease \nwith increasing inlet velocity, as explored in Fig. 5-50, Again this is an expected result and follows \nfrom the boundary layer theory.\n\n1.2E-2\n\nCM\n\nCD\nw\n8\n\no\n\nX\n\n\u00abMCB\n\n8.0E-3 -\n\nZ  4.0E-3 -\n\nO.OE+O -------------------^ ^ ^ ---------------------------------1---------------------------------,----------------------\n\n0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06\nDistance from inlet edge (m)\n\nFig. 5-50 Mass fluxes profile for various inlet velocity at S \u00ab 1,0\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results an d D iscussions gg\n\n5.4.5 Local Mass Transfer Coefficient at Top Surface\n\nAs have been discussed by Lee et al. (1992), the convective mass transfer coefBcient \ncalculated from the analogy between heat and mass transfer holds only if the top surface is \ncompletely covered with liquid resulting in the saturated vapor conditions at all points on the \nsurface. If the surface is partially wet, then the average vapor pressure at the surface should be \nless than the saturated value. Thus, it is interesting to e?q)lore the near surface physics using the \npresent drying model. For this purpose, the local convective mass transfer coefficient at the \nsurface for S\u00ab1.0 are presented in Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 for inlet velocities of 1.0 ~ 10.0 m/s and \ncompared with the convective mass transfer coeflBcient calculated from the correlation of \nboundary layer theory.\n\nIn each figure six set o f results are presented. The solid line is obtained from the boundary \nlayer theory; large slashed line represents the numerical results assuming that the top surface is \ntotally covered with liquid; triangles are numerical resuhs for actual situation as seen in Figs. 3-7 \nto 3-9, that is, part o f the top surface is wetted and part is solid; slash-dotted line is curve fitting \nfor the triangles; circles are numerical results for actual situation averaged over the surface of \neach control volume; small slashed line is curve fitting for the circles. More details about each one \nof the set of results will be provided in the next paragraphs.\n\nThe mass transfer coeflBcient in Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 is defined as\n\nPvs-P\u00ab\n\nwhere k is the convective mass transfer coeflBcient, is the vapor flux density, pyg is the \nsaturated vapor density and p\u201e is the inlet vapor density.\n\nTo show the validity o f the present numerical results, the local mass transfer coeflBcient \ncalculated using the 100x20 uniform grid with assumption o f the saturated vapor density at all \npoints on the top surface (total wet surface) are also presented in Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 and compared \nwith that calculated from the correlation of boundary layer theory. According to boundary layer \ntheory, the local mass transfer coeflBcient for laminar flow can be calculated using the following \ncorrelation\n\nSh, = 0 .3 3 2 R ef Sc*'' for S O l (5-1)\n\n\n\nChapter 5 Results an d  D iscussions gg\n\nwhere Sh?  is the local Sherwood number, (kx/D), Re^ is the local Reynolds number, (pU\u201ex/|a), \nand Sc is the Schmit number, (v/D).\n\nIt can be found from these figures that the deviation between numerical and analytical \nresults concentrates near the upstream and increases with the inlet velocity. This is so because, as \nhave been mentioned at the begmning of this section, the grid used for external flow is not refined \nenough for describing the vapor density derivative near the inlet edge where the boundary layer is \nvery thin. With a higher inlet velocity, the boundary layer near the inlet edge is thinner resulting in \na larger deviation between the numerical and analytical results. However, the numerical results are \nreasonable for a qualitative analysis.\n\nIt can be also seen that the local mass transfer coefficients calculated numerically for the \nactual situation (S=1.0) under all investigated inlet velocities are higher than that calculated from \nthe boundary layer theory. It is an expected result since the top surface o f network is not totally \ncovered by liquid even when the saturation at the top surface is equal to 1.0 The wet surface is \nabout 30% of the total surfece at S=1.0. Clearly, the saturation conditions can be only used on \nwet surface and at the solid surface the vapor pressure is practically zero. Comparing with the \ntotally wet surface, less vapor enter into the external flow resulting in a lower mass fraction in the \nboundary layer and, consequently, a higher local convective mass transfer coefficient. The local \nmass transfer coefficient presented in Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 for the actual situation is the local value for \nwet surface. In other words, the area for mass transfer considered here is not the total top surface, \nbut the sectional area o f throats on the top surface. Recalling the Fig. 3-9 that shows the coupling \nof the porous medium with the external flow, the local mass transfer coefficient for wet surface is \nobtained using the mass flux density at the wet surface, not the average value for the total surface.\n\nThe local mass transfer coefficient calculated from average mass flux density for actual \nsituation shows a very interesting behavior. One can note from Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 that these local \nmass transfer coefficients agree well with the correlation value for all investigated inlet velocities. \nAgain, the deviation occurs only near the inlet edge and increases with increasing inlet velocity. It \nseems that the local mass transfer coefficient obtained from analogy can be used at the very \nbeginning of the drying even though the top surface o f porous medium is not totally covered with \nliquid. It should be pointed out that the wet surface is somehow distributed periodically on the top \nsurface of network and is in accord with the point o f view of the continuum approach. As the \nevaporating front receding from top surface, of course, the wet patches are no longer distributed \nperiodically on top surface and, as have been shown in Fig. 5-47 ~ 49, the local mass transfer \ncoefficient will be quite different from that obtained using the correlation.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d D iscussions 100\n\n1.2E-1\n\nI\no\ne\nOU\ni-\ns</>\nc\n5\n(/)</)<0\n\nU a  1 .0  m / s  \n\nb o u n d u y  la y e r  t h t o r y  (cofT\u00ab\u00abation )\n\n-------------------- n u m \u00ab r ic a J r \u00bb \u00ab jttf c f  total v \u00bb \u00ab ts u rfic #\n\nA  num efical r e s u lt f c r  a c tu a l situalion\n\n------- --F I  fo r a c tu a l situation: log(Y)BB1og(X>M\n\nO .........a v \u00ab r a g \u00bb f > u m e r ic a lr e s u lf c r a e tu a is iu a tio n  \n.................... ...F \u00bb tb r a v e f\u00ab g a p e * u t;lo g (Y )\u00ab e T o g C X )* A\n\nO.OE+O\n9 . . .

The vapor density is back calculated using the convective \nmass transfer coefiBcient obtained under the saturated conditions at the top surface. One can find \nthat the vapor density at the top surface is less than the saturated value for all surface saturation. \nThis is in accord with the observation of Lee et al. (1992) in their experiment results. Also noting \nis that the vapor density for the same surface saturation decreases with an increasing inlet \nvelocity.\n\n5.4.6 Moisture Field and Boundary Layer\n\nThe boundary layer for the alcohol vapor mass fi-action during the drying simulation are \npresented in Fig. 5-57 ~ 59 for some cases. The numbers in the figures are not the mass fraction \nbut the relative humidity value of the alcohol vapor (P/Pq) due to the small values of the mass \nfraction. The size of external domain is 60 x 3 mm, and in the figures presented here the y- \ndirection is amplified to show the boundary layer more clearly.\n\nFrom Fig. 5-57, one can see that the boundary layer thickness decreases as drying \nproceeds. The mass fraction near the top surface decreases rapidly with the receding evaporating \nfront during the early drying period. After the interface is totally dried, the mass fraction near the\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults an d  D iscussions 102\n\ntop surface reduce to a very low value, and the boundary layer thickness remains almost \nunchanged.\n\nSome evaporation focuses are observed when the top surface is partially wetted at the \nearly drying period. As have been discussed before, the mass flux is very affected whether the top \nsurface is dry or wet. This difference can be of the order of ten times. The evaporated alcohol \nvapor goes into the external flow mainly from the wet patches. When the external flow velocity is \nnot very high, the alcohol vapor evaporated from the wet patches is not carried away by \nconvection quickly enough, and the mass fraction near these wet patches become higher than that \nof the adjacent regions, yielding a mass fraction gradient along the top surface that can be in the \ndownstream or upstream direction, depending on the mass fluxes and on the velocity of external \nflow.\n\nComparing Figs. 5-57, 58 and 59, one can see that the thickness of the boundary layer \ndecreases with increasing inlet velocities due to the stronger convection. The boundary layer \nthickness for U=5.0 m/s, for example, is just a half of that for U=1.0 m/s. The thickness of the \nboundary layer for U=10.0 m/s, however, is only a little smaller than that for U=5.0 m/s. The \nsame behavior is observed for the mass fraction near the top surface, which is reduced from about \n0.481 to 0.301 while the inlet velocity increases from 1.0 to 5.0 m/s. The top surface mass \nfraction only decreases from 0.301 to 0.251 as the external flow velocity increases from 5.0 to \n10.0 m/s, indicating that the external flow influence decrease with increasing inlet velocity.\n\nIt can be also noted that the evaporation focuses observed at low inlet velocity is no \nlonger so obvious when the inlet velocity is relatively high. This is so because the alcohol vapor \nevaporated from the wet patches (focuses for low inlet velocity case) can be carried downstream \nby convective for the higher inlet velocities, and the vapor evaporated from wet patches, \ntherefore, can not be accumulated to form the focuses of alcohol vapor.\n\nThe boundary layers for case of U=1.0 m/s are drawn in Fig. 5-60 in color to show more \nclearly the evaporation focuses at the top surface. One can see that there are some high alcohol \nvapor concentration regions at the top surface (red areas) while the surface is partially wetted. \nThese focuses o f alcohol vapor are coincident with the wetted surface where the evaporation \nfluxes are very high. After the top surface is totally dried, no focus is observed at the interface.\n\nIt should be noted that different scales for the mass fraction were employed for the various \nsaturation in drawing Fig. 5-60. The same color indicates different mass fraction value in different \ndrying stages. One can refer to Fig. 5-57 to have an idea about the mass fraction value during the \ndrying process.\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults and Discussions 103\n\nS = 0.90 S = 0.40\n\nS = 0.80 S = 0.30\n\nS = 0.70 S = 0.20\n\nS = 0.60\n\nS = 0.50\n\nFig. 5-57 Mass fraction boundary layer for U=1.0 m/s\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  R esults and Discussions 104\n\nS = 0.90\n\n^ ro i\nr ----------:------, ------------------- ---- U.Ul i -r ^  .1\u2014 ,\n\n.  j .  . .JU- rfWh. . .  jfes. j t : .  j\n\n\u2014  ^  nn?R\u2014\n\nS -  0.40\n\n0.001------------ -\n\nWHHL ?HfltnBn(nlftllW>f\n\nS = 0.80 S = 0.30\n\nS = 0.70 S = 0.20\n\nS = 0.60\n\n- 0 .0 0 1 -\n\nS = 0.10\n\nS = 0.50\n\nFig. 5-58 Mass fraction boundary layer for U=5.0 m/s\n\n\n\nC h a p te r s  Results and Discussions I OS\n\nS = 0.90 S -  0.40\n\nS = 0.80 S = 0.30\n\nS = 0.70 S = 0.20\n\nSO.Ol! g a g )  0315\n\nS = 0.60 S - 0 . 1 0\n\nnno\u00ee\n\n\u00cb \u00c6 j\u00bb '\n\nS = 0.50\n\nFig. 5-59 Mass fraction boundary layer for U=10.0 m/s\n\n\n\nC hapter 5 Results and Discussions 106\n\nS = 0.90 S = 0.40\n\nS = 0.80 S = 0.30\n\nS = 0,70 S = 0.20\n\nS = 0,60 S = 0.10\n\nS - 0 .5 0\n\nFig. 5-60 Mass fraction boundary layer for U=1.0 m/s (color)\n\n\n\nChapter 6 Conclusions 107\n\nCh a p t e r  6  C o n c l u s i o n s\n\nA microscopic drying model for capillary porous medium is presented in this thesis. This \nmicroscopic model is based on a network approach for porous medium and is intended to study \nthe mass transfer behaviors inside the porous medium at the pore level during the drying process. \nIt can be used, for example, to study the efifect of heterogeneities of phase distribution in porous \nmedium, that cannot be attained by a macroscopic drying model due to the continuum approach. \nMoreover, the Kelvin effect can be studied in a quantitative manner. The influence o f dry patches \nat the interface on the local mass fluxes can be shown clearly in the present simulation since the \nmicroscopic model is able to describe the phase distribution at the top surface.\n\nThe phase distribution effect, the Kelvin effect and the influence of inlet velocity o f the \nexternal flow upon the drying process are studied in the present thesis using this microscopic \nmodel. From the simulations the following conclusions can be extracted.\n\n\u2022 Three distinguished regions are observed in simulation, i.e., dry region, unsaturated region \nand saturated region. The evaporating fi-ont region (unsaturated region) is relatively stable, \nalthough it is far from being a flat surface. Many temporary liquid clusters appear in the \nunsaturated region as drying proceeds and the cluster number increases with increasing \ndistance of the evaporating front from the top surface. In other words, the depth of the \nevaporating front region increases during the drying process. This observation indicates \nthat the two-zone model used to describe the simultaneous heat and mass transfer during \nthe falling rate period is more realistic than the single zone model.\n\n\u2022 Phase distribution (moisture heterogeneities) has a great influence on the drying rate \nthrough the formation of the funicular dry zone, specially at the beginning o f the drying \nprocess. This influence decreases with the receding of the evaporating front from the top\n\n\n\nChapter 6 Conclusions 108\n\nsurface. The drying process becomes vapor diffusion dominated after the interface is \ntotally dried and the influence of phase distribution heterogeneities decrease.\n\nEvaporation-condensation inside the porous medium is observed in the present \nsimulations. Some clusters are condensing at one drying time interval and can not be \neliminated by evaporation action. These condensing clusters always appear surrounded by \nother evaporating clusters. They can become evaporating clusters and thus be eliminated \nas drying proceeds.\n\nConcerning to the microscopic model, the Kelvin effect makes a very small difference in \nterms o f the difilision driving force caused by the meniscus curvature. The Kelvin effect, \nhowever, is very important from the point of view of the evaporation-condensation \nmechanism. The appearance of condensing clusters changes the drying path due to the \nliquid removing process. Consequently, the phase distribution is altered during the drying \nprocess. This influence is not the same for different network.\n\nDry patches phenomena (surface saturation) have a strong influence on the local mass \nfluxes at the interface. The difference of mass fluxes for wet and dry surface can reach to \nten times.\n\nConstant rate period is not observed for the simulations performed in the present work \nbecause that only 30% of top surface is covered with liquid even as top surface saturation \nequals to 1.0. A second drop in the drying rate is found, which indicates the moment that \nthe top surface becomes totally dried.\n\nNumerical local mass transfer coefficient for the totally wetted top surface agree with the \nanalytical value. The local mass transfer coefficient calculated from average mass flux \ndensity for actual situation shows a very interesting behavior. The local mass transfer \ncoefficient agree well Avith the correlation value for all investigated mlet velocities even \nthough the top surface is not totally covered with liquid, but periodically distributed.\n\nInlet velocity of the external flow over the top surface o f the porous medium affects the \nlocal mass fluxes. This is significant only while the interface is totally or partially wet. The \ninfluence o f the inlet velocity decreases with the receding evaporating front. Concerning \nthe stability o f the evaporating front, it seems that this is only important at the begiiming of \ndrying.\n\n\n\nC hapter 6 Conclusions 109\n\nIt should be pointed out that the network size used in the present work (100x20) is not \nlarge enough to assure statistical homogeneity. As can be seen in chapter 5, different networks \nwhich are constructed with the same size distribution of pores and throats, but with a different \nrandom generator, do not show the same drying kinetics. In fact, the random generator will settle \nthe spatial distribution of clusters of small diameter throats: when these clusters are located near \nthe top surface, the efifect is to increase the drying rate, as a consequence of smaller vapor \ndifRision resistance. The networks considered in the present work are, nevertheless, important for \ndescribing the efifect of heterogeneities in the spatial distribution of pores on drying kinetics, \nspecially at the very beginning of drying. In fact, spatial heterogeneities are frequently found in \nsamples used for drying as a resuh of sample manufacturing. These heterogeneities have a great \ninfluence on the early stage of drying, when the drying depth is of same magnitude order as the \nmean heterogeneity length.\n\nIt is worthy reminding that the microscopic drying model presented here is, in some \nmeanings, a simplified model. Naturally, there are many improvements that should be done for the \nmodel. The mechanism for liquid transfer considered here, for instance, is only the capillary force. \nThe formation of liquid films on the porous surface at unsaturated regions, as have been observed \nby Prat in his experiments (1993), is not taken into account and may modify the drying kinetics. \nThe gravity efifect, which can play a role either as stablisant or d\u00e9stabilisant of evaporating front, \nis ignored. The model can not address all drying situations and heat transfer is not taken into \naccount in the present model. To describe the porous medium better, the model should be \nextended to three dimensions.\n\n\n\nReferences 110\n\nR e f e r e n c e s\n\nAdler P.
