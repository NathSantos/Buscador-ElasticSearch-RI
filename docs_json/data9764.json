Introduction\n\nThe mineral tunellite [1,2] is hydrated hydroxy borate of stron-\ntium of formula SrB6O9(OH)2?3H2O. The mineral is a rare mineral\nformed in borate deposits. The mineral is named after George\nGerard Tunell, Jr. (1900\u20131996), Professor of Geology, University\nof California, Los Angeles, California, USA. The mineral is known\nfrom a significant number of deposits worldwide [1,3\u20136].\n\nTunellite is one member of a series of borate compounds of the\nborate series M2+O.3B2O3?xH2O [7]. Other borate minerals include\nveatchite (Sr), p-veatchite (Sr) with x = 2, nobleite (Ca), with\nx = 4, aksaite (Mg) and gowerite (Ca) with x = 5 [7]. Many synthetic\nborates with this fundamental formula have been forthcoming. The\nchemistry of tunellite including its thermal decomposition has\nbeen studied by Gulensoy and Teberdar [8]. The effect of heat\ntreatment on the structural properties of the tunellite has been\nstudied [9]. Hydrogen bonding in tunellite has been elucidated\n[10]. Boron NMR spectroscopy has proven useful for the study of\nthe polyanions in tunellite [11].\n\nTunellite is monoclinic with point group 2/m [2,7]. The cell\ncharacteristics are P21/a with a = 14.415(3), b = 8.213(1),\nc = 9.951(2), b = 114.05(1)_ and Z = 4. Tunellite occurs in prismatic\ncrystals up to 10 cm long or compact fine-grained nodules. The\ncrystal structure contains infinite sheets composed of polymerized\nborate polyanions, with Sr2+ cations and water molecules filling\navailable spaces in and near the sheets [7]. Adjacent sheets are held\ntogether solely by bonds to water molecules [7]. The polymerized\nborate polyanions are composed of individual borate groups, each\ngroup containing three B\u2013O tetrahedra and three B\u2013O triangles.\n\nVibrational spectroscopy has been applied to borate glasses\n[12\u201315]. There have been a number of studies of borate glasses\ndoped with a wide range of radioactive atoms [16,17]. Borate\nglasses are used as a means of containment of radioactive materi-\nals. There have been a number of studies looking at the effect of\nradiation on borate glasses [18,19]. If there is to be an understand-\ning of borate glasses and their role in radioactive element contain-\nment, then an understanding of the vibrational spectroscopy of\nborate minerals needs to be undertaken. The number of vibrational\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.10.012&amp;domain=pdf\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.10.012\nmailto:r.frost@qut.edu.au\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.10.012\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00222860\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/molstruc\n\n\nR.L. Frost et al. / Journal of Molecular Structure 1059 (2014) 40\u201343 41\nspectroscopic studies of borate minerals is quite few and far be-\ntween [20\u201323]. The number of Raman studies of borate minerals\nis also very limited [24,25]. There have been a number of infrared\nstudies of some natural borates [26\u201329]. Most of these references\nare not new and there have been no recent studies on the vibra-\ntional spectroscopy of natural borates. Ross in Farmer\u2019s treatise re-\nported the infrared spectra of several borate minerals [30].\n\nThe use of infrared spectroscopy is limited by the spatial reso-\nlution of the technique which is around 25 lm. In comparison,\nthe spatial resolution using Raman spectroscopy is 1 lm. Thus,\nwhen studying a mineral using spectroscopic techniques it is\nadvantageous to use Raman spectroscopy. The selection of the tar-\nget mineral is more easily made. With infrared spectroscopy, any\nimpurities will be measured as well as the target mineral. Raman\nspectroscopy has proven most useful for the study of secondary\nminerals [25,31\u201336].\n\nTo the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, there have been very few\ninfrared spectroscopic studies of tunellite type structure [29,37]\nand no Raman studies of this natural mineral have been forthcom-\ning. The objective of this paper is to report the vibrational spectro-\nscopic study of a natural tunellite mineral and relate the spectra to\nthe molecular chemistry and the crystal chemistry of this borate\nmineral. We have characterised tunellite using a combination of\nRaman and infrared spectroscopy.\nFig. 1. (a) Raman spectrum of tunellite (upper spectrum) over the 4000\u2013100 cm?1\n\nspectral range and (b) infrared spectrum of tunellite (lower spectrum) over the\n4000\u2013500 cm?1 spectral range.\n2. Experimental\n\n2.1. Mineral\n\nDetails of the mineral have been published (page 80, vol. 5)\n[38].\n\n2.2. Raman spectroscopy\n\nCrystals of tunellite were placed on a polished metal surface on\nthe stage of an Olympus BHSM microscope, which is equipped with\n10?, 20?, and 50? objectives. The microscope is part of a Reni-\nshaw 1000 Raman microscope system, which also includes a\nmonochromator, a filter system and a CCD detector (1024 pixels).\nThe Raman spectra were excited by a Spectra-Physics model 127\nHe\u2013Ne laser producing highly polarised light at 633 nm and col-\nlected at a nominal resolution of 2 cm?1 and a precision of\n\u00b11 cm?1 in the range between 200 and 4000 cm?1. Repeated acqui-\nsitions on the crystals using the highest magnification (50?) were\naccumulated to improve the signal to noise ratio of the spectra. The\nspectra were collected over night. Raman Spectra were calibrated\nusing the 520.5 cm?1 line of a silicon wafer. The Raman spectrum\nof at least 10 crystals was collected to ensure the consistency of\nthe spectra.\n\n2.3. Infrared spectroscopy\n\nInfrared spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 870 FTIR\nspectrometer with a smart endurance single bounce diamond\nATR cell. Spectra over the 4000\u2013525 cm?1 range were obtained\nby the co-addition of 128 scans with a resolution of 4 cm?1 and a\nmirror velocity of 0.6329 cm/s. Spectra were co-added to improve\nthe signal to noise ratio. The infrared spectra are given in the sup-\nplementary information.\n\nSpectral manipulation such as baseline correction/adjustment\nand smoothing were performed using the Spectracalc software\npackage GRAMS (Galactic Industries Corporation, NH, USA). Band\ncomponent analysis was undertaken using the Jandel \u2018Peakfit\u2019 soft-\nware package that enabled the type of fitting function to be\nselected and allows specific parameters to be fixed or varied\naccordingly. Band fitting was done using a Lorentzian\u2013Gaussian\ncross-product function with the minimum number of component\nbands used for the fitting process. The Lorentzian\u2013Gaussian ratio\nwas maintained at values greater than 0.7 and fitting was\nundertaken until reproducible results were obtained with squared\ncorrelations of r2 greater than 0.995.\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\nThe Raman spectrum of tunellite in the 4000\u2013100 cm?1 region\nis displayed in Fig. 1a. This figure reports the position of the Raman\nbands and their relative intensity. It is noted that there are parts of\nthe spectrum where no intensity is observed. Therefore, the spec-\ntrum is subdivided into sections in subsequent figures so that more\ndetailed assessment of the spectrum can be made. In a similar way,\nthe infrared spectrum of tunellite in the 4000\u2013500 cm?1 region is\nreported in Fig. 1b. The spectrum is not shown below 500 cm?1.\nThe reason for this is that we are using a reflectance technique\nand the ATR cell absorbs all incident radiation. In a similar fashion\nto the Raman spectrum, the infrared spectrum is divided into sec-\ntions depending upon the types of vibrations being observed.\n\nThe Raman spectrum of tunellite in the 1200\u2013700 cm?1 spectral\nrange is reported in Fig. 2a. The infrared spectrum of tunellite in\nthe 1200\u2013700 cm?1 spectral range is reported in Fig. 2b. The Ra-\nman spectrum in this spectral region is dominated by a sharp\nintense band at 994 cm?1. Bands of significantly lesser intensity\nare observed at 1043, 1063, 1082 and 1113 cm?1. The Raman band\nat 994 cm?1 is assigned to the BO stretching vibration of the B6O9\nunits. The Raman bands at 1043, 1063, 1082 and 1113 cm?1 are\nattributed to the BOH in-plane bending modes. Iliev et al. deter-\nmined the Raman spectrum of a synthetic cobalt tunellite [39].\n\n\n\nFig. 2. (a) Raman spectrum of tunellite over the 1200\u2013700 cm?1 spectral range and\n(b) infrared spectrum of tunellite over the 1000\u2013650 cm?1 spectral range.\n\nFig. 3. (a) Raman spectrum of tunellite (upper spectrum) in the 700\u2013400 cm?1\n\nspectral range and (b) infrared spectrum of tunellite (lower spectrum) in the 400\u2013\n100 cm?1 spectral range.\n\nFig. 4. (a) Raman spectrum of tunellite (upper spectrum) in the 3800\u20133100 cm?1\n\nspectral range and (b) infrared spectrum of tunellite (lower spectrum) in the 3800\u2013\n2800 cm?1 spectral range.\n\nFig. 5. Infrared spectrum of tunellite over the 1800\u20131500 cm?1 spectral range.\n\n42 R.L. Frost et al. / Journal of Molecular Structure 1059 (2014) 40\u201343\nThe symmetry species of some vibrational modes were deter-\nmined. Iliev et al. [40] used Raman imaging to show the ferroelec-\ntric properties of tunellite type compounds. These workers [40]\nshowed that tunellites exhibit a sequence of transitions from the\nhigh temperature paraelectric cubic phase to ferroelectric ortho-\nrhombic, monoclinic, trigonal phases, and finally to a monoclinic\nphase at low temperatures where both ferroelectric and magnetic\norders coexist. Kim and Somoano determined the improper ferro-\nelectric transition using Raman spectroscopy [41].\n\nIn contrast, the infrared spectrum of tunellite (Fig. 2b) shows\ncomplexity with many overlapping bands, making the assignment\nof the infrared bands very difficult. The intense infrared band at\n\n\n\nR.L. Frost et al. / Journal of Molecular Structure 1059 (2014) 40\u201343 43\n960 cm?1 with shoulders at 929, 947 and 985 cm?1 is assigned to\nthe trigonal borate stretching modes. The overlapping infrared\nbands at 784, 809, 844, 863 and 877 cm?1 are attributed to the\ninfrared tetrahedral borate stretching and bending vibrations.\nThe series of bands from 669 through to 737 cm?1 are related to\ntrigonal borate bending modes.\n\nThe Raman spectra in the 700\u2013400 cm?1 and in the 300\u2013100 cm?1\n\nspectral range are illustrated in Fig. 3a and b. Sharp Raman bands are\nobserved at 464, 480, 523, 568 and 639 cm?1. These bands are simply\ndefined as trigonal and tetrahedral borate bending modes. A series of\ninfrared bands at 669, 679, 699, 708, 728 and 737 cm?1 (Fig. 2b) are\ndue to these bending modes. Strong Raman bands are found in the\nfar wavenumber region at 150, 332 and 371 cm?1 (Fig. 3b). These\nbands may be simply described as lattice vibrations.\n\nRaman spectrum of tunellite in the 3800\u20132700 cm?1 spectral\nrange and the infrared spectrum of tunellite in the 3700\u2013\n2500 cm?1 spectral range are reported in Fig. 4a and b. According\nto the commonly accepted formula of tunellite SrB6O9(OH)2?3(H2O),\nboth water or OH groups are found in the formula of the mineral.\nThe Raman spectrum clearly shows intense Raman bands at 3567\nand 3614 cm?1. These bands are assigned to the stretching\nvibrations of the OH units. Two OH-stretching bands in the Raman\nspectra of the mineral, at 3405 and 3494 cm\u20131, respectively, are\nindicative of two distinct hydrogen positions in the structure. Other\nstrong intensity bands at 3243, 3282, 3324, 3369, 3383 and\n3430 cm?1 are found. These broader bands are assigned to water\nstretching vibrations.\n\nThe infrared spectrum in the 1800\u20131300 cm?1 region is reported\nin Fig. 5. An infrared band centred upon 1677 cm?1 is observed\nwhich may be band component analysed into several components\nat 1631, 1660 and 1727 cm?1. These bands are attributed to water\nbending vibrations. The intensity as observed in the infrared spec-\ntrum is quite strong with a broad band at 1631 cm?1 found.\n\nThe development of these type of compounds such as tunellite\nrests with their ferromagnetic and pyro-electric properties [42].\nThe development of piezoelectric properties is time continuous\n[43,44]. Also a hydroxy compound has been synthesised [45],\nalthough the vibrational spectroscopy of this compound was not\nreported. In the infrared spectrum (Fig. 2b) a series of low intensity\nbands are observed.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nThere are many borate minerals which have yet to have their\nvibrational spectrum determined and the molecular structure as-\nsessed in terms of their vibrational spectrum. In this work we have\nmeasured the Raman and infrared spectrum of tunellite, a\nhydrated hydroxy borate mineral of calcium with formula:\nSrB6O9(OH)2?3(H2O). The importance of the mineral tunellite rests\nwith the chemistry of the compound and the range of isomorphic\nsubstitutions which can be made in order to produce specially\nselected ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties.\n\nThe Raman spectrum in this spectral region is dominated by a\nsharp intense band at 994 cm?1. Bands of significantly lesser inten-\nsity are observed at 1043, 1063, 1082 and 1113 cm?1. The Raman\nband at 994 cm?1 is assigned to the BO stretching vibration of\nthe B6O9 units.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe financial and infra-structure support of the School of\nChemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering, Science and\nEngineering Faculty, is gratefully acknowledged.
