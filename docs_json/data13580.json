(2016). Bioretention for diffuse pollution control in SUDS using\nexperimental-adaptive approaches of ecohydrology. Doctoral Thesis, S\u00e3o Carlos School\nof Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Carlos.\n\nProblems of land use and occupation in urban areas may prevent the infiltration of water,\nthus increasing runoff. Bioretention techniques are solutions, which are emerging from the\nhydrology field to mitigate the consequences of increasing urbanization, including,\nflooding and contamination of rivers. The general objective of this research is to study the\ngeneral efficiency of combined Compensatory Techniques (CT) with detention and\nbioretention control of diffuse pollutants from an urban drainage system. Specific\nobjectives are defined in each chapter and relates to sizing and to the bioretention systems\nof modeling and monitoring, located in southeastern Brazil, S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 S\u00e3o Carlos. The\nfirst chapter presents the general introduction of the thesis, the objectives and research\nhypotheses, as well as, the description of the general methodology for the thesis\nconstruction and the goals related to each chapter. The second chapter discusses the scope\nand some limitations of the classifications of terms frequently used in the theme of\nsustainable urban drainage. This chapter, in a way, approaches the other chapters, which\ncomposes this thesis, by providing them comprehensive database of references. The third\nchapter presents the design criteria used for the construction of experimental bioretention\nsystem and compares the design with the model HEC \u2013 HMS - Hydrologic Engineering\nCenter - Hydrologic Modeling System. The fourth chapter talks about some criteria to\nidentify areas for building bioretention systems and presents the GIS - Geographic\nInformation System and ecohydrology indicators, in this characterization, considering the\nquantity and quality aspects in the urban drainage. The fifth chapter shows the use of\nPCSWMM model (Personal Computer Stormwater Management Model) to simulate future\nscenarios, assuming progressive modular expansion of CTs, modeling efficiency in\nqualitative and quantitative aspects diffuse pollution for scenarios 2015, 2025, 2050, 2100.\nThe conclusion of this research is that compensatory techniques can be used not only to\nassess the impacts of diffuse pollution stemmed from urban drainage system, but as a\ncontribution to the sustainability of watersheds and to mitigation of extremes risks derived\nby increased urban drainage demand.\n\nPalavras-chave: Sustainable urban drainage, Compensatory techniques sizing, Diffuse\npollution.\n\n\n\nRESUMO\n\nROSA, A.

GENERAL CONCLUSION .................................................................................. 106\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\nHistorically, urban drainage in Brazil has focused on surface runoff water\n\ntreatment, resulting in the concept of conduit based drainage systems, as highlighted by\n\nPomp\u00eao (2000). In the 1990s, the Brazilian research centers that worked with urban\n\ndrainage sought to adapt the so-called \u201cCompensatory Techniques\u201d (CTs) to compensate\n\nthe effects of urbanization for the runoff, whose review and typology are discussed by\n\nBaptista et al. (2005). These CTs were adaptations of techniques developed by research\n\ngroups from Europe, the U.S. and Australia. Currently, these concepts have brought out\n\nconsiderations and changes in the paradigms of the new Urban Master Plans (PENNINO et\n\nal., 2016). These experimental and adaptive approaches have been named as Sustainable\n\nUrban Drainage Systems-SUDS, Water Sensitive Urban Design -WSUD, Best\n\nManagement Practices-BMP and/or Low Impact Development-LID (SAMPLE et al., 2014;\n\nHUNT et al., 2006).\n\nAccording to A. Morales-Torres et al. (2016), urban stormwater management is a\n\ncomplex subject, directly linked with other parts of the urban water cycle: the management\n\nof one element (either good or bad) can influence the successful management of another\n\none. Considering this, this thesis is divided in several chapters to explore this complexity.\n\nThus, it is presented in the first chapter of this thesis the general introduction of this work,\n\nits objectives and research hypotheses, as well as, the description of the general\n\nmethodology for the thesis construction and a list of goals with its respective chapters.\n\nIt is observed that these new concepts essentially address the same principles and\n\nthe same types of solutions, whether by structural and/or non-structural means. According\n\nto Fletcher et al. (2012), these new approaches prioritize induced infiltration, retention,\n\nrunoff bio-filtration, control at the runoff source, landscape integration with the urban\n\nspace, non-transfering of the downstream impacts and a multidisciplinary approach to\n\nenvironmental education and social participation. In this sense, the second chapter\n\ndemonstrates, through bibliometric technique, a survey of publications and research\n\nprojects, from a collection of 22 terms frequently used in the subject sustainable drainage.\n\nIn short, all concepts are related to maintaining the urban conditions as close as\n\npossible to the natural conditions of the hydrological cycle (qualitative and quantitative),\n\nseeking to integrate quantity efficiencies (stored volumes, attenuated peak flows, delay of\n\nflow time) and water quality (considering diffuse pollution with the physical-chemical,\n\nmicrobiological and ecotoxicological aspects).\n\n\n\n2\n\nHowever, in spite of two decades of developing CTs in Brazil, there has been little\n\npractical usage of the solutions developed, especially at the scale where they have been\n\nstudied. The main reasons are driven by the scale of drainage problems: I) there is a\n\npreference for detention reservoirs in macro drainage systems (CANHOLI, 2005), due to a\n\nlack of technical upgrading of the drainage management agencies to deal with the\n\nimplementation, operation and maintenance of diffuse, decentralized and small structures,;\n\nII) society has difficulty in understanding the relationship between small-scale solutions\n\nand large-scale problems: experimental research has focused on control at the source on a\n\nlocal scale, while the urban drainage problems are seen on a large scale, as well as the\n\ndifficulty of inserting qualitative and quantitative parameters in the design of bioretention\n\nsystems.\n\nThus, the third chapter details the methodology used to measure and simulate the\n\nbioretention system, object of this research, entitled BIoREteNtIon CEll method -\n\nBIRENICE. And it also compares it with the HEC-HMS model, which is widely used in\n\nresearches.\n\nOne of the main difficulties in choosing propitious areas to build bioretention\n\nsystems ends up being the characterization and detail of the terrain. Some factors such as\n\nslope, land use and soil type must be taken into consideration. Regarding this difficulty, the\n\nfourth chapter demonstrates, with the use of GIS tools along with some indicators from\n\necohydrological studies, a more detailed and precise analysis of suitable areas for building\n\nbioretention techniques. Emphasizing that the system of monitoring has shown that the\n\nbenefits of CT implementation constitute a landmark for urban drainage.\n\nThe fifth and final chapter evaluate the performance of bioretention technique\n\nthrough computer simulations as a result of mathematical modelling through the SWMM5\n\nPCSWMM in version 6.2. The model inputs correspond to hydraulic, hydro-\n\nmeteorological and geotechnical components, being calibrated by the method of multi-\n\nobjective optimization, allowing users to set tolerances for the parameter of uncertainty in\n\nSWMM layers, running the model to the extremes of this range of uncertainty. The model\n\nresponds in the form of the flow and level of water infiltration, making it possible to\n\nevaluate the removal of pollutants and the water volume for different characteristics of\n\nprecipitation events.\n\nThis doctorate research project is connected to and has the financial support of\n\nthree ongoing projects: (1) MAPLU2 \u2013 Stormwater Management in the Urban\n\nEnvironment/FINEP Agreement 0982/10(01.10.0701.00), composed of a network of 16\n\n\n\n3\n\nBrazilian IES, (2) Thematic Project FAPESP 2008/58161-1 \u201cAssessment of Impacts and\n\nVulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil and Strategies for Adaptation Options\u201d, through\n\nits Component 6 (EESC/USP) \u201cMitigation and adaptation measures of vulnerable\n\ncommunities to cope with water-related risks derived from climate change scenarios at\n\nriver basins of S\u00e3o Carlos\u201d; and (3) Casadinho/PROCAD CNPq 552494/2011-9 (UFAL-\n\nEESC/USP) \u201cAdvanced monitoring of biotechnological processes and environmental\n\nquality\u201d.\n\nThis research has an integrative aspect of the three (presented) projects, through\n\nwhich it was possible to reach the objectives proposed here. With MAPLU2 project, a\n\nbroad network of researches and partnerships was accessed, fortifying the following study\n\nthrough experiments, replicating methodologies and Compensatory Techniques\n\nexperiments in different regions of Brazil.\n\nWith the thematic project, FAPESP research was inserted in the subject of climate\n\nchanges and its consequences to the urban environment, reflecting the contributions of this\n\nstudy for this research field, strengthening the proposal to model future scenarios due to\n\nthe impacts caused by urbanization.\n\nWhile participating in the Casadinho/PROCAD project, it was possible to deepen\n\nthe knowledge obtained related to water monitoring quality. As follows, one of the main\n\nobjectives of this project, which intended to study the application of molecular techniques\n\nto detect pathogenical organisms in the environment, especially in urban scenarios, is to\n\ncontribute to the water resources management through compensatory monitoring\n\ntechniques, mainly of urban areas.\n\nIt is important to notice that the participation in these projects provided great\n\nvisibility to the research by participating in major international scientific events. One of the\n\nevents was the Scientific Expedition Brazil \u2013 Germany, 490148/2011 \u2013 5o Planning tools\n\nand measures for sustainable management of water resources in Brazil. This expedition\n\ninvolved researchers from the University of Kassel and University of S\u00e3o Paulo (S\u00e3o\n\nCarlos School of Engineering - EESC). Another important event was the International\n\nconference on Water, Megacities and global change - 2015 December 1st - 4th 2015 at\n\nUNESCO HQ - Paris - France. After this participation, the project gained visibility in\n\nBrazil, published in printed and televised media.\n\n\n\n4\n\n1.1 Research Hypotheses\n\nConsidering the state of the art on CTs for the control of diffuse pollution of urban\n\ndrainage, these research hypotheses state that:\n\n? The compensatory techniques, when studied in the form of combined detention with\n\nbioretention, represent more efficient adaptation strategies to control urban drainage\n\nchanges in the long run,\n\n? Under these scenarios, the master plans seek to optimize resources and incorporate\n\ndrainage resilience, therefore the techniques will actually be compensatory if\n\nprogressive systematic rehabilitation or \u201cmodular\u201d steps are included to increase\n\nefficiency during its lifetime,\n\n? Ecohydrological indicators are tools that evaluate how this generalized efficiency is\n\nincreased, and how quantity and quality of diffuse pollution could better characterize\n\nurban drainage if an experimental and adaptive approach is used.\n\n1.2 General Methodology\n\nThe general methodology follows the schematic flow chart shown in Figure 2.1,\n\ndivided into six steps: (1) pollutant loads analysis enchases the diffuse pollution of urban\n\ndrainage; (2) theoretical-adaptive approach of the compensatory techniques (CT) practices\n\nis used; (3) experimental approach with sizing by detention and bioretention; (4) choosing\n\nof experimental areas for construction of compensatory techniques practices; (5)\n\ninstallation and quality-quantitative monitoring during the working of compensatory\n\ntechniques practices; and (6) performance evaluation of CT. The discussed methodology\n\nmay apply to any situation.\n\n\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.1 - Long-term project flowchart\n\n\n\n6\n\n1.3 Relationship between Objectives, Methods and Products\n\nFigure 1.2 shows the flowchart of the practical implementation of this research.\n\nThe first phase was the construction of a CT system, based on a comprehensive study and\n\ncharacterization of the area to be implemented, taking into account the legal and\n\nadministrative requirements of land use and ecohydrological indicators. The research\n\nrecognizes that the use of compensatory techniques can be an effective alternative to\n\nstemmed diffuse pollution control of urban drainage, using experiments built in real scale\n\nin previously selected areas.\n\nFrom documentary and literature surveys that culminated in the discussion of the\n\nmethodological scope and its limitations and through a thorough theoretical overview, the\n\nmethodology was developed. Bibliometric techniques were used and supported the\n\nunderstanding of different denominations related to sustainable urban drainage techniques\n\nas well as research groups, institutions and researchers involved. It resulted in the article:\n\nSustainable urban drainage: delineation of the scientific domain of knowledge production.\n\nFigure 1.2 - Practical implementation flowchart\n\n\n\n7\n\nThrough the proposed and implemented sizing model, adding to the aggregate\n\nknowledge through conceptual theoretical research, it was proposed the second product,\n\nwhich deals with the methodology used in the design of CTs system, the object of this\n\nresearch. It demonstrates innovative aspects as modular design and considered qualitative\n\nand quantitative aspects. This step resulted in the article: Modular sizing is bioretention\n\nsystems to urban scenarios considering scale and increasing urbanization time - a case\n\nstudy in the city of S\u00e3o Carlos.\n\nThe choice of areas to construct the CTs systems can be considered one of the\n\nmost complicated steps in the implementation process and monitoring of these techniques.\n\nThe project was implemented with the support from the Brazilian legal framework and\n\necohydrologicals indicators that supported the preliminary studies, giving rise to the fourth\n\nchapter of this thesis called: CT for control urban drainage with ecohydrology base: GIS\n\nas a tool for choices propitious areas.\n\nThe last paper, but not least, demonstrates that through the use of PCSWMM for\n\nmodelling qualitative and quantitative data obtained by monitoring the compensatory\n\ntechnique, it is possible to study CT\u2019s performance.\n\nThus, the project included the methodological steps ranging from the study of the\n\nrelevance of compensatory techniques in urban drainage to computer simulations to\n\nevaluate the performance of the project after its construction.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nBARBOSA, A.

SUSTAINABLE URBAN DRAINAGE: DELINEATION OF A SCIENTIFIC\nDOMAIN OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION*\n\n*A modified version of this chapter has been submitted as: ROSA, A.; PROCOPIUCK, P.; MACEDO, M. B.;\nSAMPLE, D.; SOUZA, V. C. B.; MENDIONDO, E. M. Sustainable urban drainage: delineation of a scientific\ndomain of knowledge production. Submitted to Water Resources Management. Manuscript Number - WARM-\nD-16-00952.\n\nAbstract\n\nSustainable Urban Drainage emerged and gained prominence during the late 90s. Despite this\nprogress, there is little uniformity in subjects and definition of terms within the overall\nsustainability theme. This tends to create a duplication of objectives and confusion about the\ncorrect use of techniques and procedures. This paper seeks to identify, map and evaluate\n\u2018Sustainable Urban Drainage\u2019 as a scientific domain, using relationships between underlying\nsubthemes. We analyzed 3,805 publications by 8,237 authors with relation to 11,957 citations\nusing sociometric and bibliometric techniques. The results confirm the existence of the\nknowledge domain with one main nucleus and 20 independent networks. Core subthemes\nsuch as stormwater management, low impact development, integrated urban water\nmanagement, bioretention, and best management practices are distinguishable the main\ndomain.\n\nKeywords: scientific domains, low impact development, integrated urban water management,\nbioretention, best management practices\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nQuestions related to urban drainage have occupied professionals and researchers in\n\ndifferent contexts. Over the last decades, practical results, adaptations, experiences and\n\ntechniques have been the object of scientific literature originating mainly from Europe, the\n\nUnited States of America (USA), and Australia. Research within the area of natural\n\nhydrological cycles represents a point of convergence within this theme.\n\nA central concept in the urban drainage literature is knowledge generated in\n\nnetworks involving intellectual, social, and physical, chemical, and biological processes.\n\nStudies focusing upon the theoretical development and practical application of new methods\n\nare principally concerned with reducing negative impacts from urban development, as well as\n\nthe expansion of the respect for the natural environment limitations.\n\nFrom this perspective, studies of urban drainage range from those that are strictly\n\ntechnical in nature - e.g. induced infiltration, retention and (bio) filtration \u2013 to\n\nmultidisciplinary socio-technical studies whose aim is to avoid downstream transfer of\n\nimpacts, and reinforce environmental education and social participation. In this range of\n\napproaches ranging from the technical scope to the political one, the increasing concern on\n\n\n\n9\n\nunderstanding how to operationalize socio-technical solutions capable of assuring significant\n\nlevels of success based on the sustainable development principles become more relevant.\n\nThis paper seeks to identify, relate and analyse a group of research areas united by a\n\nsustainable urban drainage theme. This study maps and explains the relationships between\n\nauthors and subthemes related to urban drainage in an international context. The work seeks\n\nanswers to the following questions: Which are the main subthemes that emerge under the\n\nsustainable urban drainage theme? Which are the major countries and authors that stablish\n\nrelationships among the subthemes? Which are the more active subthemes in the scientific\n\ncommunity?\n\n2.1.1 Theoretical perspectives on urban drainage\n\nAs communities build improved responses to urban drainage problems, social\n\nresearch that explains how scientists interact and how they reach consensus on methods is\n\nconducted.  Scientific enterprise depends, to a large extent, on the community\u2019s ability, to\n\nadopt assumptions and dedicate themselves to implementing specific practices, until new\n\nscientific knowledge becomes available. New investigations will consequently lead the\n\ncommunity to a new set of practices. While it is theoretically possible to repeat this process\n\nindefinitely, in reality it tends to degrade over time, eventually leading to the emergence of\n\nnew methods, which, as they propagate, repeats the process. Within the sustainable urban\n\ndrainage theme, the fundamental questions currently in discussion pertain mainly to general\n\nmethods and philosophical principles (KUHN, 2000, pp. 23-25).\n\nIn the case of conventional urban drainage systems, efforts to expand knowledge\n\ntends to concentrate on internal components (GELDOF, 1995). For example, reducing runoff\n\nvolume through infiltration, removes this source of flow to downstream areas more or less\n\npermanent. This influence is perceived on the amount of technical developments and\n\ntheoretical framework about drainage based on conduits for the construction of stormwater\n\nsewers and actions to increase the flow capacity of rivers and canals (POMP\u00caO, 2000;\n\nPROCOPIUCK &amp; ROSA, 2015). Although, this perspective on development of knowledge\n\nabout urban drainage is important in the scope of technological development as well as fast\n\nresponses to emergency problems; it showed itself little fruitful in offering more aligned\n\nsolutions to the sustainable development.\n\nSince the 60s, municipal master plans have adopted protection of natural resources as\n\na policy goal, indicating a broader focus of urban drainage. Research are now focused on\n\n\n\n10\n\naspects other than flooding of streams to overcome problems caused by the development of\n\nintegrated methods and measures to mitigate urbanization effects (GELDOF, 1995, p. 16;\n\nPOMP\u00caO, 2000).\n\nThe development of techniques to reduce flows by temporary storage in the soil,\n\nthrough infiltration was created out of necessity to prioritize planning actions (POMP\u00caO,\n\n2000). While originating in the broad strategies of environmental management, urban\n\ndrainage can be understood as a network of relationships between intellectual, social,\n\nphysical, chemical, and biological processes (GELDOF, 2005).\n\nOn a constant development process marked by new demands of sustainable urban\n\ndevelopment, the technicist paradigm was replaced by a new perspective focused on\n\nmultifunctional adaptive structure for managing natural resources. Integrated management\n\nemerges as a multidisciplinary approach to face uncertainties on how to handle natural\n\nresources (JEFFREY &amp; GEAREY, 2006). This change of perspective has contributed\n\nsignificantly to the rise of a new concept of urban drainage, sustainable urban drainage\n\n(SUD).\n\nSUD research can be classified into: alternative techniques (Tim D. Fletcher et al.,\n\n2014), best management practices (Davis, Hunt, Traver, &amp; Clar, 2009; Tim D. Fletcher et al.,\n\n2014; Zhou, 2014;), bioretention systems (R. A. Brown &amp; Hunt III, 2010; Davis, 2008; Lucas\n\n&amp; Sample, 2015; Sample et al., 2012; Sample &amp; Liu, 2014), compensatory techniques (Tim\n\nD. Fletcher et al., 2014), design stormwater (Park, Chung, Yoo, &amp; Kim, 2012), diffuse\n\npollution control (Panagopoulos, Makropoulos, &amp; Mimikou, 2013), green infrastructure (Tim\n\nD. Fletcher et al., 2014), integrated urban water management (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014),\n\nlow impact development (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014; T. J. Scott et al., 2014; Zhou, 2014),\n\nlow impact urban design and development (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014; Zhou, 2014),\n\nmanagement of urban drainage (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014), management of urban water\n\n(R. Brown, 2005; Lee &amp; Yigitcanlar, 2010), source control (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014),\n\nstormwater control measures (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014), stormwater management (Davis\n\net al., 2009; Roseen et al., 2009; T. J. Scott et al., 2014; Zakaria, Ab Ghani, Abdullah, Mohd.\n\nSidek, &amp; Ainan, 2003), stormwater quality improvement devices (Begum, Rasul, &amp; Brown,\n\n2008), stormwater quality studies (T. D. Fletcher, Andrieu, &amp; Hamel, 2013; Newman, Aitken,\n\n&amp; Antizar-Ladislao, 2013; Zakaria et al., 2003), stormwater quantity studies (R. Brown, 2005;\n\nZakaria et al., 2003), stormwater treatment efficiency (Zhang, Zhou, Li, &amp; Yu, 2010),\n\nsustainable drainage systems (Lee &amp; Yigitcanlar, 2010), sustainable urban drainage systems\n\n(Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014; Zhou, 2014), and water Sensitive Urban Design (Davis et al.,\n\n\n\n11\n\n2009; Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014; Lee &amp; Yigitcanlar, 2010; Sharma, Gray, Diaper, Liston, &amp;\n\nHowe, 2008).\n\nThe increase and spread of different approaches to understand a phenomenon tends\n\nto demonstrate its importance and dynamic. However, in this case, it complicates effectively\n\nunderstanding the domain and its central themes. In this study, we investigate the direction of\n\nSUD research.\n\n2.1.2 Methodological approach to the comprehension of the theoretical field of urban\n\ndrainage\n\nConsidering this complexity, we contend that clarity and direction of the research\n\nthemes within SUD can be enhanced through domain analysis. According to Argas-Quesada\n\nand de Moya-Aneg\u00f3n (2007), domain analysis is one of the novel fronts of research emerging\n\nfrom advancements in information visualization of networks and this approach helps reveal\n\nthe essence of scientific knowledge, especially in multidisciplinary fields with intense\n\nchanges.\n\nDomain analysis is based upon the concept that the best way to comprehend a\n\nknowledge field is through analysis of speech patterns, and identifying the networks that\n\nprovide structure to knowledge areas. Knowledge domains contain unique structures and\n\norganization, and standards of cooperation, language, and communication means (Argas-\n\nQuesada &amp; de Moya-Aneg\u00f3n, 2007; Hj\u00f8rland &amp; Albrechtsen, 1995). Based on sociometric\n\ncriteria, domain mapping generates  images that express the networks, relationships, and roles\n\nthat scientific communities play in society (Argas-Quesada &amp; de Moya-Aneg\u00f3n, 2007; Hood\n\n&amp; Wilson, 2000).\n\nIn addition, bibliometric analysis reduces subjectivity by informing statistics such as\n\nthe number of authors, of publications, and of countries of origin in the citations of a  domain\n\ncategory (Price, 1976, p. 39). Bibliometric studies use statistical and mathematical methods to\n\nidentify historical trends in the literature and assess emerging standards, mainly through\n\nanalysis of the relationship between authors and the use of domain knowledge and themes. In\n\nthese studies, a sociometric technique known as the Social Network Analysis (SNA)\n\nperspective is often used. SNA views the researcher as a socially interconnected actor.\n\nAdvancing science and producing knowledge requires interactions, associations and the union\n\nof abilities according to common views. This is especially the case with collaborative works.\n\n\n\n12\n\nThe central-periphery model provides an important tool for SNA, facilitating the\n\nevaluation of cohesion between nodes in a network. This evaluation algorithm calculates the\n\nproximity values in relation to the center and, from that, the correlation between the empirical\n\nmatrix and the theoretical one. The evaluation was conducted with continuous method to\n\nattribute a score to the relationships of each node to the center (Borgatti &amp; Everett, 1999).\n\n2.2 Material and Methods\n\nThe bibliometric analysis was conducted in two phases. First, was performed under a\n\nqualitative method through the choice of expressions from a body of text comprised of 50\n\npapers that address different perspectives of SUD studies; the papers served as a basis to the\n\nconstruction of a research project under the theme. The objective was to make a systematic\n\nsurvey of the most relevant terms and expressions. That survey resulted in 22 expressions,\n\nwhich are listed in Table 2.1\n\nSecond, phase was conducted using a quantitative method, exploring research papers\n\nand reviews that contained high information credibility and authored by prominent\n\nresearchers in the SUD field. The data was compiled in August 2015, from the Web of Science\n\ndatabase, covering all complete papers and reviews registered since the year 1864. The\n\nsoftware VantagePoint (Search Technology, 2006) was used to house and structure the data\n\nand assist in further analysis.\n\nInitially, 18,662 documents were identified, which reduced to 3,805, in the second\n\nphase. A filter was used in the following areas: Environmental Science Ecology, Engineering,\n\nWater Resources, Agriculture, Geography, Architecture, Science technology other topics,\n\nUrban Studies, Biodiversity Conservation, Physical Geography, Chemistry and Public\n\nAdministration. This refinement was necessary because many expressions have multiple\n\nmeanings, outside the interest of SUD research.\n\nThe queries in the \u2018Web of Science\u2019 were based on the expressions in the first\n\ncolumn of Table 2.1. The searches included each expression altogether in quotation marks.\n\nThus, abbreviations and acronyms were omitted.\n\nThe data in the last column of Table 2.1 was condensed, for each expression, in a\n\nmatrix of co-citation in the software VantagePoint. These databases were converted into\n\nedglist1 files through Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) codes run inside Microsoft Excel,\n\nto be imported by the software Ucinet. The visualization of the networks was made with the\n\nsoftware NetDraw.\n\n\n\n13\n\nFinally, the evaluation of the centrality of countries, institutions, themes and authors\n\noccurred using the Core/Periphery model of Ucinet (Borgatti, Everetti, &amp; Freeman, 2002),\n\nwith 1,000 interactions processed based on continuous method. Centrality was evaluated\n\nusing the Gini index, where 0 stands for complete equality and 1 stands for complete\n\ninequality.\n\n2.3 Results analysis\n\nIn the following topics, there is a first a characterization of the body of analysis\n\ncomprised by the documents resulting from the search on Web of Science. Subsequently, it is\n\npresented the global result based on the centrality relationships between authors relative to\n\nlocations. Then, the centrality and peripheral relationships of universities or research centers,\n\nto which the authors are affiliated were characterized, as well as the themes reviewed in this\n\nresearch; and finally, the relationship between authors without an institutional mediation.\n\n2.3.1 Characterization of the analysis Basin representation\n\nAll documents selected by the search terms from the first phase, i.e., without any\n\nfilter are contained in column (b) of Table 2.1 There are the number of documents in the\n\nresearch fields with affinity with the theme in column (c). Finally, the remaining documents\n\nused in body of analysis of this paper is provided in column (d).\n\nTable 2.1 - Expressions searched in the Web of Science base\n\n(a) Searched expression\nNumber of publications resulted from the search\n\n(b) Found (c) Refined (d) Used\n1) Alternative techniques 2025 249 239\n2) Best management practices 5388 1156 1122\n3) Bioretention 362 263 259\n4) Compensatory  techniques 32 3 2\n5) Design stormwater 5 4 4\n6) Diffuse pollution control 31 26 24\n7) Green infrastructure 453 309 288\n8) Integrated urban water management 86 69 66\n9) Low impact development 349 249 215\n10) Low impact urban design and development 6 4 3\n11) Management of Urban Drainage 12 11 11\n12) Management of Urban Water 51 28 26\n13) Source control 8107 319 298\n14) Stormwater control measures 40 38 37\n15) Stormwater management 1140 809 774\n16) Stormwater quality improvement devices 3 2 2\n17) Stormwater quality 298 210 207\n18) Stormwater quantity 34 27 25\n19) Stormwater treatment efficiency 5 5 5\n20) Sustainable drainage systems 64 59 59\n21) Sustainable urban drainage systems 65 57 57\n22) Water Sensitive Urban Design 106 82 82\nTOTAL 18.662 3979 3805\n\n\n\n14\n\nThere are disparities among the results in Table 2.1 regarding the number of\n\ndocuments found, refined and used for each searched term. That happens because some terms\n\nare considered as techniques or a set of techniques in a global scope \u2013 for example,\n\nAlternative techniques, Best management practices, Source control and Stormwater\n\nmanagement \u2013 and others can be applied in different knowledge fields.\n\n2.3.2 Global network of authors and countries\n\nThe global network showed in Figure 2.1 express the relational logic of the\n\ncommunity studying SUD. This community is comprised of 8,237 authors from 82 countries.\n\nThe authors relate to each other through 11,957 bonds stablished by their location.\n\nFigure 2.1 - Global network\n\nFigure 2.2 - Relationships between authors and countries related to continent\n\nAfrica Asia Europe North America Oceania South America\n\nRelationships 370 2863 6244 7314 1881 319\n\n% 2% 15% 33% 39% 10% 2%\n\n0%\n\n5%\n\n10%\n\n15%\n\n20%\n\n25%\n\n30%\n\n35%\n\n40%\n\n45%\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n\n\n15\n\nFigure 2.3 - Relationships between authors and countries related to countries\n\nIn the global network, 32% of authors are from the USA. An intermediary group\n\nformed by 12 countries sums up 49% of authors. Finally, a last group of 80 countries gathers\n\n19% of the authors. This distribution is verified in detail in the Figure 2.2. When author\n\nlocations are consolidated from country to continent, it is apparent that 72% comes from\n\nNorth America and Europe, 25% from Asia and Oceania, and 4% from South America or\n\nAfrica Figure 2.3. When internal and external relationships of the authors are considered, the\n\ncentral countries in the SUD research network are the USA, Australia, Canada, England, and\n\nGermany, as marked by a dashed line in Figure 2.4.\n\nFigure 2.4 - Centralization of countries in terms of relations between authors\n\nIn Figure 2.4, the solid line represents the centrality of authors exclusive of their\n\nexternal relationships, i.e., international relationships. In this perspective, there is a shift of the\n\norder of the countries in terms of centrality. In order of importance, the sequence becomes the\n\nPeoples Republic of China (PRC), USA, Germany, England, Australia, and Canada. The\n\ncentrality index considering internal and external relationships are 0.786, considering only\n\ninternational relationships, the centrality index is 0.770.\n\nUS AU GB CN CA DE FR IT NL ES SE DK KR Others\n\nRelationships 6112 1724 1489 1309 1127 769 548 418 410 383 376 371 365 3590\n\n% 32% 9% 8% 7% 6% 4% 3% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 19%\n\n0%\n\n5%\n\n10%\n\n15%\n\n20%\n\n25%\n\n30%\n\n35%\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n0\n,8\n\n9\n0\n\n,2\n6\n\n0\n,1\n\n9\n0\n\n,1\n8\n\n0\n,1\n\n7\n0\n\n,1\n2\n\n0\n,1\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n7\n\n0\n,0\n\n6\n0\n\n,0\n6\n\n0\n,0\n\n6\n0\n\n,0\n5\n\n0\n,0\n\n5\n0\n\n,0\n4\n\n0\n,0\n\n4\n0\n\n,0\n3\n\n0\n,0\n\n3\n0\n\n,0\n3\n\n0\n,0\n\n3\n0\n\n,0\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,3\n\n1\n0\n\n,1\n8 0\n,2\n\n1\n0\n\n,1\n5\n\n0\n,8\n\n2\n0\n\n,2\n7\n\n0\n,1\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n9\n\n0\n,1\n\n0\n0\n\n,1\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n5\n0\n\n,0\n4\n\n0\n,0\n\n6\n0\n\n,0\n3\n\n0\n,0\n\n3\n0\n\n,0\n6\n\n0\n,0\n\n5\n0\n\n,0\n3\n\n0\n,0\n\n3\n0\n\n,0\n3\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n3\n\n0\n,0\n\n3\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n2\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n2\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n1\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n1\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n0,00\n\n0,10\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\nU\nS\n\nA\nA\n\nu\nst\n\nra\nli\n\na\nE\n\nn\ngl\n\nan\nd\n\nC\nan\n\nad\na\n\nP\neo\n\np\nle\n\ns \nR\n\n C\nh\n\nin\na\n\nG\ner\n\nm\nan\n\ny\nF\n\nra\nn\n\nce\nS\n\nw\ned\n\nen\nN\n\net\nh\n\ner\nla\n\nn\nds\n\nS\nco\n\ntl\nan\n\nd\nIt\n\nal\ny\n\nS\no\n\nu\nth\n\n K\nor\n\nea\nS\n\np\nai\n\nn\nD\n\nen\nm\n\nar\nk\n\nN\new\n\n Z\nea\n\nla\nn\n\nd\nA\n\nu\nst\n\nri\na\n\nN\no\n\nrw\nay\n\nS\nw\n\nit\nze\n\nrl\nan\n\nd\nIr\n\nan\nT\n\nai\nw\n\nan\nB\n\nel\ngi\n\num\nP\n\no\nrt\n\nu\nga\n\nl\nB\n\nra\nzi\n\nl\nM\n\nal\nay\n\nsi\na\n\nJa\np\n\nan\nIn\n\nd\nia\n\nS\no\n\nu\nth\n\n A\nfr\n\nic\na\n\nG\nre\n\nec\ne\n\nF\nin\n\nla\nn\n\nd\nT\n\nu\nrk\n\ney\nW\n\nal\nes\n\nP\no\n\nla\nn\n\nd\nL\n\neb\nan\n\no\nn\n\nIr\nel\n\nan\nd\n\nIn\nd\n\no\nne\n\nsi\na\n\nIs\nra\n\nel\nS\n\nin\ng\n\nap\nor\n\ne\nC\n\nhi\nle\n\nM\nex\n\nic\no\n\nR\nom\n\nan\nia\n\nS\nL\n\nO\nV\n\nA\nK\n\nIA\nU\n\nk\nra\n\nin\ne\n\nC\nol\n\no\nm\n\nb\nia\n\nE\ng\n\nyp\nt\n\nC\nyp\n\nru\ns\n\nE\nth\n\nio\npi\n\na\nP\n\nak\nis\n\nta\nn\n\nH\nu\n\nn\nga\n\nry\nP\n\nh\nil\n\nip\np\n\nin\nes\n\nS\nlo\n\nv\nen\n\nia\nJo\n\nrd\nan\n\nB\nul\n\ng\nar\n\nia\nT\n\nu\nni\n\nsi\na\n\nT\nh\n\nai\nla\n\nn\nd\n\nS\ner\n\nb\nia\n\nS\nri\n\n L\nan\n\nka\nV\n\nie\ntn\n\nam\nB\n\nan\ng\n\nla\nd\n\nes\nh\n\nC\nos\n\nta\n R\n\nic\na\n\nS\nau\n\nd\ni \n\nA\nra\n\nbi\na\n\nT\nan\n\nza\nni\n\na\nL\n\nu\nxe\n\nm\nb\n\nou\nrg\n\nE\ncu\n\nad\no\n\nr\nIr\n\naq\nA\n\nrg\nen\n\nti\nna\n\nU\n A\n\nra\nb\n\n E\nm\n\nir\nat\n\nes\nK\n\nen\ny\n\na\nN\n\nig\ner\n\nia\nB\n\nah\nra\n\nin\nZ\n\nim\nb\n\nab\nw\n\ne\nN\n\no\nrt\n\nh \nIr\n\nel\nan\n\nd\nM\n\nal\naw\n\ni\nK\n\nu\nw\n\nai\nt\n\nF\nr \n\nP\no\n\nly\nne\n\nsi\na\n\nG\nh\n\nan\na\n\nA\nlg\n\ner\nia\n\nV\nen\n\nez\nu\n\nel\na\n\nIc\nel\n\nan\nd\n\nB\nye\n\nla\nru\n\ns\nC\n\nze\nch\n\n R\nep\n\nu\nb\n\nli\nc\n\nM\nal\n\nta\nE\n\nst\non\n\nia\n\nInternal Relationships\n\nInternational Relationships\n\n\n\n16\n\n2.3.3 Relationship between research institutes\n\nRegarding the relation between centrality and peripheral of institutions to which the\n\nauthors are affiliated, in the universe of 2,027, 12 are from the USA, 3 from Australia, 2 from\n\nChina, 1 from Sweden, 1 from Austria and 1 from Denmark.

This set of authors,\n\nformed by 21 communities, is comprised of 543 authors and 4826 relationships. The nodes\n\nidentified in black represent the principal authors, classified according to the core-periphery\n\nmodel.\n\nFigure 2.11 - Network of authors with degree higher than 10\n\nIn Figure 2.11, it is worth noting the broad network located in the bottom right corner\n\nis dominated by the core authors. Regarding the other smaller networks, interesting\n\nperspectives arise for investigations into which methods or interests structure the relationship\n\nbetween authors.\n\n2.3.6 Relationships of intermediation capacity\n\nThe betweenness centrality index considers a network as a whole and is an\n\nexpression of the capacity of each author to establish relationships between other two non-\n\nneighboring authors in the network. The relationships between the two non-neighboring\n\nauthors depends on the intermediary authors, which implies that the latter has a greater\n\ninfluence over the social network. The authors with higher level of intermediation are\n\n\n\n22\n\nconsidered core connectors because they provide the connection for a large number of authors\n\nin the network.\n\nThis metric enables the evaluation of importance of a particular author as a function\n\nof the flow passing by that author. The 70 authors with the highest intermediate centrality\n\nindex in 2,012 relationships are shown in the network of Figure 2.12, with indices ranging\n\nfrom 249.2 to 2341.6.\n\nFigure 2.12 - Betweenness centrality\n\nThe 15 most relevant authors in terms of intermediation centrality are Marsalek, J\n\n(2,341.6), Bradford, A (2,291. 2), Meyer, P (2,078.3), Mikkelsen, PS (1,901.4), Hunt, WF\n\n(1,770.8), Sample, DJ (1,677.3), Pesseport, E (1,650.6), Davis, AP (1,509.8), Li, J (1,505.1),\n\nDeletic, A (1,482.3), Rauch, W (1,374.8), Smith, P (1,254.9), Drake, J (1,242.0), Li, JY\n\n(1,225.9), Fran, C (1,205.7).  In the intermediation network, the authors are identified as\n\nstrategically located in a central position within the network; and they have an important role\n\nin the flux by their capacity to concentrate and make directly available information of other\n\nauthors. They are authors that facilitate direct contact with many others without the necessity\n\nof intermediates, and exert important influence in the network information flux.\n\n2.4 Conclusions\n\nThe sociometric and bibliometric techniques described in this paper helped identify,\n\nmap and objectively evaluate the domain formed by scientific publications related to a set of\n\n\n\n23\n\n22 themes related to SUD, involving researchers from 82 countries, 2,027 research centers,\n\n8,237 authors interacting through 11,857 citation relationships. In this domain, 72% of the\n\nrelationships occurred between authors from European and North American countries.\n\nThe research supporting SUDS has drawn attention from a large number of countries.\n\nFrom the results, it can be inferred that the central locations, in terms of relationships between\n\nresearchers and research centers, are USA, Australia, Canada, England, and Germany. When\n\nthe internal relationships of each author of each location are considered, the PRC takes the\n\nsecond place among the core countries. Considering the great number of authors that\n\narticulate themselves in a large international, it is difficult to generalize tendencies in the area\n\nguided only by the geographical location of the authors of seminal texts. On the other hand,\n\nthe domain shows that, if there are such pretensions, research should be expanded to capture\n\nlocal and regional nuances to fully explore SUD. From that expanded domain, generalizations\n\nwould become more realistic.\n\nAmong the 8,237 authors, the ones considered as core authors in terms of density of\n\ncitation relationships with authors from other countries are Fletcher, TD; Deletic, A; Rauch,\n\nW; McCarthy, DT; Hatt, BE; Kleidorfer, M; Sitzenfrei, R; Bach, PM; and Urich, C. Although\n\nthese pose as references to the domain due to their relationships in the central network, there\n\nare other authors that stand out with relevant levels of leadership in 20 smaller networks.\n\nMoreover, if the evaluation is accomplished under the perspective of intermediation, the 15\n\nmost relevant authors are Marsalek, J; Bradford, A; Meyer, P; Mikkelsen, OS; Hunt, WF;\n\nSample, DJ; Pesseport, E; Davis, AP; Li, J; Deletic, A; Rauch, W; Smith, P; Drake; Li, JY;\n\nand Fran, C. While authors from the first core group dominates in terms of strong\n\nrelationships among each other, mainly because they belong to a selective group of 4\n\nuniversities, the second group stand out because their publications broaden the reach of SUD\n\nknowledge produced by other authors.\n\nThe majority of research conducted on SUD has been conducted within developed\n\ncountries. That probably derives from the investment capability of these countries and their\n\nconcerns with alternative solutions based on the SUD perspective, assigning greater\n\nimportance to the environmental issues. The low participation of African and South-American\n\ncountries, which provided only 2% of the citation relationships, can be explained by the lower\n\npriority environmental issues may have in developing countries.  However, it may represent a\n\nmissed research and development opportunity if not corrected.\n\nThe most active themes in the academic community included: Stormwater\n\nmanagement, Low impact development, Integrated urban water management, bioretention\n\n\n\n24\n\nand best management practice. The nuclear position of these themes may indicate interesting\n\npaths to future research regarding SUD and may suggest analytical efforts to try to unify the\n\nnomenclature and form a domain of scientific research. The formation of a domain would\n\nfacilitate, on the one hand, a deepening of research, and on the other hand, bring benefits to\n\npolicymakers so they may understand and justify public policies based on a more consistent\n\ntheoretical diagnosis about how important it is to follow up such references on SUD.\n\nIn the present research, it was verified that the Brazilian researchers appear isolated,\n\nnot getting any prominence in any of the connections presented. This may occur because of\n\nthe different terminologies used from those considered in this study. Also, this groups have\n\npublished in other languages than English or because Brazilian academic production is not\n\nindexed in the platform web of Science. The language variable can be a considerable\n\nlimitation, even if the possibilities of articles written in a language other than English have a\n\nvery low probability of being cited in the international scientific community, which uses\n\nEnglish as the basis for scientific communication in studies on the subjects covered by this\n\nresearch. However, before being a limitation, this last hypothesis can be seen as an important\n\ndiscovery that can be evaluated by the methodology developed, for example, by expanding\n\nthe databases used in future research. This could open interesting ways to objectively evaluate\n\nwhether such limitation arises from the intentional strategy of the Brazilian scientific\n\ncommunity to refrain from publishing in English or from a limitation imposed by the English\n\nlanguage as a barrier to international insertion.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support of projects: (1) MAPLU2 - Stormwater Management in\nUrban Environment/FINEP, (2) Thematic Project 2008/15161-1 FAPESP \u201cAssessment of\nImpacts and Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil and Strategies for Adaptation Options\u201d\n(3) Casadinho/PROCAD CNPq 552494/2011-9 (UFAL-EESC / USP) \u201cAdvanced monitoring\nof biotechnological processes and environmental quality\u201d and (4) CNPq 307637/2012-3 of\nScientific Productivity.

MODULAR SIZING FOR BIORETENTION SYSTEMS TO URBAN\nSCENARIOS CONSIDERING TIME SCALE AND INCREASING URBANIZATION -\nA CASE STUDY IN THE CITY OF S\u00c3O CARLOS, BRAZIL*\n\n*ROSA, A.; MACEDO, M. B.; SAMPLE, D.; SOUZA, V. C. B.; MENDIONDO, E. M. Modular sizing for\nbioretention systems to urban scenarios considering time scale and increasing urbanization - a case study in the\ncity of S\u00e3o Carlos, Brazil. Submitted to Journal of Hydrology. Protocolo HYDROL21595\n\nAbstract\n\nEspecially after the 90s, the literature and research addressing the theme of sustainable urban\ndrainage systems have expanded. However, there is still a gap in the supply of bioretention\nsystems sizing methods that consider the characteristics and climatic conditions of different\nregions where these practices are to be implemented. This paper presents a new bioretention\nsizing methodology called BIoREteNtIon CEll method \u2013 BIRENICE, with a focus in\nsubtropical climates. The method presents, as innovation, the modular sizing with simulation\nscenarios. The methodology details the sizing and simulation method proposed by\nBIRENICE. A case study with a bioretention field application was made for a\nmicrocatchment at Campus 2 of University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in S\u00e3o Carlos, Brazil. We then\ncompared the results with HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modeling System - Hydrologic Modeling\nSystem), an already consolidated model. The proposed model, BIRENICE, makes possible to\ncalculate the dimensions of a bioretention cell for future scenarios. The simulation module\npresented the water balance behavior over time, allowing the confirmation of the sizing. The\nresults demonstrate that the simulations for BIRENICE method are accurate and have a\nsimilar behavior with HEC-HMS. In addition, BIRENICE shows that the stored volume\ndecays by percolation over time, while in HEC-HMS, this loss is not estimated in reservoirs.\nBy comparison, the sizing and simulation method proposed, BIRENICE, has little difference\nin front of results found with HEC-HMS, showing its applicability. For further research, we\nrecommend to monitor bioretention cell in field for comparing actual data with simulated data\nby the proposed method.\n\nKeywords \u2013 LID, urban drainage, stormwater practice design, subtropical\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nAccording to P\u00f4mpeo (2000), in Brazil, urban drainage and runoff treatment have\n\nbeen focused on hydraulic conveyance, which remains the prevailing design objective.\n\nTraditional stormwater drainage has been found to be incapable of handling the impacts of\n\nurban development (Dietz, Clausen, 2008). Therefore, the development of alternative\n\ntechnologies emerged to deal with the impacts of urbanization. As an alternative to traditional\n\ndrainage measures, Low Impact Development (LID) practices have emerged and have\n\nbecome increasingly popular (Sample &amp; Liu, 2014). LID practices handles urbanization\n\nimpacts in a holistic manner and seeks to counterbalance their effects systematically.\n\nRecently, the conservation of the water balance prior to urbanization has been a relevant focus\n\n\n\n28\n\nand is employed by reducing impermeable surface creation and increasing infiltration through\n\na variety of means.  LID practices also reduces runoff volume and slows the speed as the\n\nvolume moves downstream (Prince George's County, 2000). Baptista et al. (2005) presented\n\nan overview of types and operation of several LID practices. Those alternative technologies\n\nfor urban drainage, which are focused on low impact and sustainable urban drainage,  have\n\nother names according to different authors, such as: Alternative Techniques (Fletcher et al.,\n\n2014); Best Management Practices (BMP) (Davis et al., 2009; Fletcher et al., 2014; Zhou,\n\n2014); Compensatory Techniques (Fletcher et al., 2014); Diffuse Pollution Control\n\n(Panagopoulos et al., 2013); Management of Urban Drainage (Fletcher et al., 2014);\n\nSustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) (Fletcher et al., 2014; Zhou, 2014), and Water\n\nSensitive Urban Design (WSUD) (Davis et al., 2009; Fletcher et al., 2014; Lee &amp; Yigitcanlar,\n\n2010; Sharma et al., 2008). However, the most common terms are LID, BMP, WSUD e\n\nSUDS.\n\nThe practices within LID technologies can be applied in three major scales: font\n\ncontrol, micro drainage and macro drainage (Marsalekk and Schereier, 2009). A great number\n\nof practices, such as infiltration trenches, permeable pavements and green roof are usually\n\nemployed in a large scale with a better interaction between user and technology. The\n\nbioretention practices, on the other hand, are also known as rain gardens, and even though\n\nthey can be used in a large scale they are a good option for micro-drainage (Sample et al.,\n\n2013). Two treatment processes within the bioretention practices are filtration and infiltration\n\n(Erickson et al., 2013), which contribute to both water retention as well as the treatment of the\n\nwater runoff quality (Sample et al., 2013).\n\nAlthough there are over two decades of studies in LID operation and sizing, most\n\nstudies have been focused upon hydrologic performance and water quality limited to the\n\nlaboratory-scale, once field studies are more difficult, more expensive and harder to isolate\n\nsingle variables (Liu et al., 2014). There also remain gaps on how to predict the hydrologic\n\neffectiveness and water quality of bioretention (Lucas &amp; Sample, 2015). Additionally, little\n\nhas been conducted in subtropical climates, which presents distinct hydrologic characteristics\n\nwith high temperatures and evapotranspiration rates. Nonetheless, developing countries are\n\nlocated in these regions, which have different socioeconomic conditions, large urban\n\nagglomerations and megacities associated with a lack of urban planning and economic\n\ncontrasts. There is a lack of understanding in the basic physical processes through which LID\n\npractices actually works when applied in field (interaction with the user, visual integration\n\nissues, waste and water quality issues, and potential risk of environmental degradation) (Liu et\n\n\n\n29\n\nal., 2014, Sample &amp; Liu, 2014). A particular need is to concern the sizing issue, i.e., what size\n\nis appropriate for a real watershed (Roy-Poirier et al., 2010).\n\nMany authors have been working on developing models, simulations and\n\nstandardized methods and parameters aiming at a proper evaluation and design of LID\n\npractices. Elliott &amp; Trowsdale (2007) reviewed appropriate evaluation models for SUDS,\n\nLID, BMPs, WSUD and more. Winston et al. (2011), Lintern et al. (2011) and Fletcher et al.\n\n(2015) discussed how to choose the key parameters that can be used as a sizing criteria and its\n\ninfluence in bioretention performance and useful life. In Brazil, Souza et al. (2011) adapted a\n\nrainfall-runoff model to simulate LID practices in urban drainage systems under different\n\nmitigation scenarios.\n\nTable 3.1, adapted from Liu et al. (2014), presents different models used to simulate\n\nand measure LID practices, including bioretention. The first column on the left brings the\n\nmodel used; the middle column describes briefly the model; and the right column cites some\n\nresearchers that have used the correspondent model on their research. The models SWMM,\n\nHEC-HMS, RECARGA and DRAINMOD present the advantage of being public-domain,\n\nwhich makes its acquisition easier. The DRAINMOD and RECARGA are less used models\n\nonce the first was originally developed to simulate agricultural fields and has been adapted to\n\nbioretention and the last was developed to simulate a single bioretention cell. However,\n\nSWMM and HEC-HMS are hydrologic models employed for distinct purposes, including LID\n\npractices and bioretention and are more internationally supported.\n\n\n\n30\n\nTable 3.1 - Computational models and it assignments for simulation in alternative methods of urban drainage (Source: Liu et al., 2014)\n\nModel Brief description Capabilities Processing LID application References Quali-quantitative\nassessment\n\nSpatio-temporal\nModule Sizing\n\nSWMM Public-domain; hydrologic,\nhydraulic and water quality model\nwith optional continuous\nsimulation (note: several\nproprietary, value-added versions\nexist).\n\nDetailed analysis of watershed\nwith storage-focused LID\n\nRunning under Windows, SWMM5;\nrunning hydrologic, hydraulic and water\nquality simulations; and viewing the results\nin a variety of formats.

Silveira and Goldenfum (2007) present a pre-sizing \"general methodology\" for LID\n\npractices. However, their methodology only considers quantitative aspects in peak flows and\n\nvolume controls. Akan &amp; Houghtalen (2003) developed a detention basin sizing methodology\n\nthat integrated sediment removal as assessed by total suspended solids (TSS), but no other\n\nwater quality constituents.\n\nGiven the increasing adoption of biofilters and bioretention, it is critical that their\n\nsize should incorporate key design parameters within an integrative approach. In this paper,\n\nwe present a method to size a bioretention cell, which has a computer-based simulation\n\nmodule, using a simple method known as loads detention to verify the dimensioning. The\n\nproposed methodology considers the range of hydrological effects (Figure 3.1) guiding\n\ntreatment processes from the individual lot to the micro drainage scale. Figure 3.1 shows the\n\nvariables of the water balance and theirs expected temporal variation. Sizing is made based on\n\nthe quantification of the cell storage volume, calculated by the difference between inflow and\n\noutflow hydrogram peak, in order to find the water balance as closely as possible to the pre\n\nurbanization period. The hydrograms used are obtained by the computer-based simulation\n\nmodule.\n\nFigure 3.1 - Hydrograms for sizing scenarios and water balance to the proposed bioretention basin, with its\ninflow, storage and outflow variables. The line colours of the graph at (c) corresponds to the inputs and outputs\nrepresented in (b). In (b), it is possible to observe the temporal variation of each variable as it is the expected in\nthe observation from the computer-based simulation. In (c), more specifically, it is possible to see the volume of\nthe cell shown by the dotted lines, which is equivalent to the peak of the stored volume. After reaching the peak.\n\nit begins to be output flow by the spillway.\n\n1\n\n\n\n32\n\nAs part of the innovation, we also propose the construction of bioretention cells\n\nusing an incremental approach, as a time-adapted strategy to improve the overall life of\n\nbioretention structure. The method proposed is the construction of a bioretention cell\n\nstructured to use multiple gradual scenarios as opposed to building a single structure to meet\n\nthe final plan (Figure 3.2). Then, it is possible to develop a plan to supply the long-term\n\ndemand with amortized costs during the lifetime of the work.\n\nFigure 3.2 - Graphs showing the increase of capacity of the urban drainage system using LID practices according\nto its demand. In (a), we have the behavior of modular design, in which system capacity is increased by three\n\ndifferent modules\n\nFinally, it was developed a case study in an urban basin in the city of S\u00e3o Carlos to\n\nverify the real application of the model and the modular design. The model\u2019s performance is\n\nassessed and compared with another commonly accepted model, HEC-HMS, using design-\n\nbased examples with a range of event-based simulation. With this comparison, we intend to\n\nshow that the proposed model presents similar results as an established model, but it has the\n\nadvantage of being focused on bioretention and ease to use, beyond enabling the user to make\n\nchanges in the equation used for better meeting their goals.\n\n3.2 Methods\n\nIn this section, it will be presented the conceptual methods of dimensioning proposed\n\nby many authors, directing to a discussion about the development of the model design and\n\nmethodology. In order to verify its applicability, the developed model was compared to an\n\nestablished model (HEC-HMS) and a bioretention cell was built in the field.\n\n\n\n33\n\n3.2.1 Sizing theory\n\nSizing by runoff retention (Vmas,quanti, eff?Qquanti)\n\nFor calculation purposes, we define the following mass variables as a function of\n\ntime: HE as the accumulated water depth at the input and HS as accumulated water depth at the\n\noutput, both of them are measured over the drainage area. The maximum potential treatment\n\nvolume can be estimated by solving a set of equations (Eq. 3.1 - 4), obtained from Silveira &amp;\n\nGoldenfun (2007). See the illustrative scheme of parameters used in the sizing in appendix C.\n\nH= =( 60 \u00d7 ? 60 ) Eq. 3.1\n?= \u00d7\u00d7 Eq. 3.2\nq = + \u00d7 Eq. 3.3\neff =? ? \u00d7? Eq. 3.4\nWhere: Vmaxquanti is the pre-sizing volume (mm height equivalent) to mitigate excessive urban runoff volume.\nThe total volume can be expressed as Vbioretention = Vmaxquanti \u2022 A, which can be simplified as Vbioretention = hmax\n\u2022 Abioretention (plant) ? hmax \u2022 Abiofilter (plant). ? is the runoff coefficient with the ratio between percolation area and\nimplementation area; A is the contribution area; C is the runoff coefficient of contribution area; L and B represent\nlength and width dimensions (m) and T  represents return time (years); ? is the filler material porosity; ? is the\nratio between the percolation area and volume (mm); Ksat is the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (mm h-1); ?\nis the infiltration efficiency reduction coefficient due to clogging and, finally, qpre is the desired flow goal, which\nis an environmental or pre-development flow established in the Drainage Master Plan.\n\nSizing by pollution charge retention (Vmas,quali, eff?Yquali)\n\nQuality parameters are normally incorporated based upon the methodology proposed\n\nby Akan &amp; Houghtalen (2003), and Hatt et al. (2009). The hypothesis considers a trial size\n\nbased upon solids mass transport retention time (tTSS quali-IN), derived from urban drainage, and\n\nthe bioretention evacuation time (tTSS quali-OUT), which set an extra volume, Vmaxquali. Akan &amp;\n\nHoughtalen (2003), and Hatt et al. (2009) discuss the relationship between Vmaxquali and\n\noutput structure size and type using the set of  Eq. 3.5 - 9. See the illustrative scheme of\n\nparameters used in the sizing in appendix C.\n\nV = \u00d7?

See the\n\nillustrative scheme of parameters used in the sizing in appendix C.\n\n= ,?( , . , ) Eq 3.10\n, = . . . Eq.3.11= . . (? . + , .? ) Eq.3.12\n? , =1? 1+ . ,? ? . ( )( ) Eq.3.13\n\nIn wich: Lbio is the length of bioretention cell; Qmax,?Pe is the maximum discharge rate entering the bioretention\ncell, Bh,flooded and Bbio respectively represent the mean width of the transversal flooded area and the width in\nbioretention cell; Ks is the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity; hmax is the maximum flooding depth above the\nbioretention cell; dbiofilter is the biofilter depth; tc is the concentration time of contribution area; fh=0,5hmax is the\ninfiltration rate for water height equal to half of the maximum flooding depth; \u00f8 is the soil porosity; n is a\nturbulence empirical hydraulic parameter proposed by Fair &amp; Geyer (1954). For preliminary design, it is\nrecommended that it is assigned the value of 1.33 (PGC, 2009).\n\nThe bioretention efficiency eff ?X,bio depends on the hydraulic loading rate, defined as\n\nthe ratio between Qmax,?Pe and Abio, on hSTT, defined as the biofilter clogging depth, and on\n\nhmeta, defined as an intermediate flooding depth to remove pollutants loads via filtration. The\n\nadvantage of using specific bioretention equations is that it can incorporate parameters such as\n\nbasin concentration time (tc) and hydraulic criteria for the hydrologic regime under which the\n\nbioretention is subjected to.\n\n\n\n35\n\nSizing by computational simulation\n\nThis fourth method integrates the detention and bioretention process and is valid for\n\nhydrological simulation. It is used the level pool flow lamination (PULS method) and total\n\npercolation in potential wet area (Aw), by the Green-Ampt method (Tucci 1993). The\n\ndischarge structure in bioretention cell output is sized in order to preserve the pre-\n\ndevelopment of water balance. Infiltration at the bottom and the sidewalls depends on the\n\nparticle size and geometry of the soil that surrounds the device. Assuming the bioretention\n\ncell with rectangular area plant (ATC) and maximum depth (hmax,LID), the criterion is\n\nsummarized as: optimize Vcell, hmaxLID and lip, subject to restrictions in Eq. 3.14 \u2013 16.\n\n, ? , (restriction of maximum flows) Eq.3.14? ? ? , +2? ? , (restriction of flowing excess) Eq.3.15\n, ? , + , ? ? ? , (restriction of polluting loads in excess) Eq. 3.16\n\nwhere: Cout,max*Qout,max, max maximum pollution load (concentration * flow) coming out of flow device,\nCf,max*fmax the maximum pollutant load that seeps into the device and Cstandard * Cstandard*Qpreurbanization,max, max\nmaximum pollution load allowed the legal standard (see CONAMA 357/05).\n\n3.2.2 Bioretention Cell Method \u2013 BIRENICE\n\nBioretention cells have multiple functions, including the reduction of runoff volume\n\n(by increasing infiltration), the reduction of peak runoff and the reduction of pollutants in\n\ndischarge flows through both mass reduction and physical and biological treatment (LIU et\n\nal., 2014), favoring the maintenance of water balance based on a pre urbanization period.\n\nBioretention can affect both water quantity and quality. Predicting hydrological and water\n\nquality results, as a function of changing bioretention design parameters, is essential to\n\nimprove performance.\n\nTo facilitate the design of a bioretention cell, we have developed a computational\n\nmodel to simulate the design, using unique parameters to each cell given its specific location.\n\nA key feature of the method is that it estimates the eventual size of the bioretention cell in\n\nmultiple, cumulative scenarios. This enables the designer to select a variety of trial sizes and\n\niteratively simulate each bioretention cells in steps, by setting the desired time intervals and\n\nthe input parameters.\n\n\n\n36\n\nThe computational model, BIRENICE, was developed in VBA (Visual Basic for\n\nApplications). The BIRENICE method allows the adoption of two rain duration values as\n\nsizing criteria. In addition, the user can choose either a single design event or continuous\n\nsimulation. In the simple mode, the structure simulation is done for a single design event, in\n\ncontinuous simulation; it is possible to simulate multiple events, creating a worksheet\n\ncontaining graphs for comparison of results from each simulated event. The model runs for\n\nthe present time and, then, continues until the bioretention cell is completely drained.\n\nThe proposed model follows the script shown in Figure 3.3. The bioretention design\n\ninput parameters are in blue, which include: return period, rain duration, contributing drainage\n\narea, soil properties, occupation scenario and filtration material medium (% empty). The gray\n\ncolor shows the intermediate parameters, calculated by the model, as follows: rainfall\n\nintensity, rainfall, effective rainfall, runoff coefficient and peak flow. As the main system\n\noutput, there is the cell volume, from which it will be sized and designed based on the\n\navailable field area. In simulation module, used to verify the sizing (represented by the pink\n\npart in Figure 3.3), it is used PULS method, which has as outputs the hydrograph for: inflow,\n\nstorage, outflow and percolation. These parameters, metrics and methods for computing them\n\nare explained in the following sections.\n\nFigure 3.3 - Diagram used for modeling and computational simulation. The model input parameters are in\nblue. The pink part is the simulation module. The methods used in the intermediate and output variables calculus\n\nare in red color.\n\n\n\n37\n\n3.2.3 Hydrological risk and return period\n\nThe risk adopted for designing stormwater management systems is defined as the\n\nprobability of occurrence or when overcoming a considered critical event for a given return\n\nperiod (T). On risk analysis, it is implied that events have their origin in natural phenomena\n\nand that there are statistical hypotheses related to the processing of hydrological variables as\n\nbeing random. In this case, if P (X ? x) is the probability of an X ? x event, then the\n\nprobability of R (hydrological risk) that X ? x occurs at least once in n years is given by Eq.\n\n3.17. Knowing that Eq. 3.18 (T) gives the return period, the hydrological risk can be written\n\nas in Eq. 3.19.\n\n=1?[1? ( ? )] Eq. 3.17= ( ) Eq. 3.18=1? 1? Eq. 3.19\nAccording to this definition, it is known that the smaller the hydrological risk is, the\n\nhigher is the return period. The adoption of a higher return period implies to size a device for\n\nincreased flow, i.e., the structure will have higher cost. Considering the lack of resources, the\n\nchoice of return period is economically limited.\n\n3.2.4 Soil properties\n\nDetermining the soil type and hydrologic group is important to set the runoff\n\ndivision. In this model, the curve number method was chosen, identifying the CN coefficient\n\naccording to Drainage Manual and Stormwater Management (S\u00e3o Paulo, 2012). The\n\ncoefficient is, then, applied in the Natural Resources Conservation Service/Soil Conservation\n\nService - NRCS/SCS hydrologic method (USDA, 1986) to determine the runoff. Another\n\nimportant soil property is the permeability coefficient, in order to quantify the percolation\n\nover time.\n\n3.2.5 Contribution of a drainage area and occupation scenario\n\nThe contribution of a drainage area is determined to quantify the peak flow runoff\n\nand total rainfall volume. In urban areas, there is a great difficulty in defining the contribution\n\n\n\n38\n\narea due to lack of alignment between the drainage projects and their implementation, as well\n\nas the large number of illegal foreign contributions.\n\nIt must also be determined the current land use area and occupation, as well as for\n\nfuture planning scenarios. Future scenarios should be determined in accordance with the\n\nguidelines of the local master plan.\n\n3.2.6 Rainfall intensity and total rainfall\n\nTo calculate rainfall intensity the model uses the IDF equation (Eq. 3.20) with the\n\ncoefficients a, b, n and m to the desired location. Then, we calculated total rainfall using the\n\nrainfall intensity (i) and the duration of the rain (t), according to Eq. 3.21.= .( ) Eq. 3.20= . Eq. 3.21\n3.2.7 Effective rainfall\n\nEffective rainfall is calculated by the method of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS-\n\nCN) represented by Eq. 3.22 and 3.23.\n\n>0.2 ? = ( . ). ; ? 0.2 ? =0 Eq. 3.22= ?254 Eq. 3.23\nWhere: Pe corresponds to effective rainfall; P to rainfall; and S to ground potential retention.\n\nThe CN coefficient represents the soil ability to retain runoff, ranging according to\n\nland use and occupation and soil type. Their values are tabulated (Drainage Manual and Water\n\nManagement Stormwater - Stormwater Drainage Manual and Management, 2012), and use, as\n\ninput, the soil hydrologic group and its use and occupation. If the area has more than a soil\n\ngroup and more than one use and occupation, the CN average value is then computed by\n\nmeans of Eq. 3.24.\n\n= ? .? Eq. 3.24\nWhere: Ai corresponds to the area of i-th basin portion corresponding to CNi coefficient.\n\n\n\n39\n\n3.2.8 Runoff coefficient\n\nThe use of rational method for the peak flow forecast requires determining the runoff\n\ncoefficient C. It represents the runoff generation percentage for the contribution area. The\n\ncalculation was done according to Eq. 3.25 (KAWATOKO, 2012).\n\n= Eq. 3.25\n3.2.9 Peak flow\n\nFor bioretention basins application as stormwater treatment practices, it is\n\nrecommended small areas of contribution and microdrainage scale. Thus, it is considered the\n\nbasins as small ones, when they are smaller than 3km2, following the recommendations of the\n\nStormwater Management Drainage Manual of S\u00e3o Paulo, and it is used the rational method\n\n(Eq. 3.26) to calculate the peak flow (Qpeak).\n\n= . . Eq. 3.26\n3.2.10 Inflow, outflow, percolation and storage\n\nOne can make the inflow determination through rational triangular hydrograph\n\nmethod, taking as input to its construction the peak flow previously calculated and the basin\n\nconcentration time. As the basin has small dimensions, it is reasonable to assume that the rain\n\nduration is equal to the basin concentration time. Thus, the hydrogram is represented as an\n\nisosceles triangle.\n\nFor the outflow, it was proposed a triangular weir with a 90\u00b0 opening angle. Thus,\n\nthe flow rate is calculated by the Thomson equation (Eq. 3.27) as a function of water height\n\n(h) above vertex of the weir.\n\n=1.4 .? . Eq. 3.27\nPercolation flow is compounded by the percolation on the structure base and walls\n\n(Eq. 3.28). The flow is calculated based on the Green-Ampt and Darcy method (Eq. 3.29)\n\n(ERICKSON et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n40\n\n= + Eq. 3.28\n= . . + +? Eq. 3.29\n\nIn which: fbase is percolation flow in the base; flateal is percolation flow in the walls; K is hydraulic conductivity;\nAbase is the structure base area; ? is wetting front suction; L is the saturated area length; and h is water level\nheight above the base device.\n\nConsidering the saturated soil, the hydraulic unit gradient can be obtained in\n\nliterature (Souza, 2002). Thus, it is possible to calculate the percolation on the sidewalls using\n\nEq. 3.30. The total area of the sidewalls, as a function of time (t), is calculated through Eq.\n\n3.31.\n\n= .??. ( ) Eq. 3.30( )= 2. + +2.?( ) Eq. 3.31\nWhere: Alateral (t) is the sidewalls area and h(t) is the height of the water depth.\n\nThe purpose of the LID device in this project is to mitigate the effects of urbanization\n\nso that the effective rainfall is equal to, or less than, the prior urbanization situation, i.e. the\n\nsituation described in the year 1900. According to Tucci et al. (1993), the dimensioning of\n\nintensive measures for flood control of hydraulic structures, such as reservoirs, is made to\n\noperate the reservoir in such a way to dispose the natural flow until it damps the peak flow\n\nand it is transferred downstream. In Tucci et al. (1995), simplified methods to scale flood\n\ncontrol structures in holding a tank are presented and they use only a few input hydrograph\n\ninformation such as the value of peak, peak time and/or time of concentration. Considering\n\nthese elements and establishing a critical flow output, which is less than or equal to the natural\n\nflow of the river, it is estimated the volume of the required reservoir. Thus, in this case, the\n\nstorage (S) is calculated using the difference in depth minus the peaks, according to Eq. 3.32.\n\n= . Eq. 3.32\nThe bioretention cell is filled with a granular material. By knowing the medium\n\nmaterial porosity, the estimated volume of the compensatory structure is calculated using Eq.\n\n3.33.\n\n= . Eq. 3.33\nWhere: n is media material porosity.\n\n\n\n41\n\n3.2.11 PULS Method\n\nThe PULS method is also known as the \u201cLevel Pool Routing\u201d and it is used to\n\nsimulate retention device-behavior. It considers the continuous equation, described in Eq. 3.34\n\n(CHOW et al., 1998). Adjusting to a bioretention cell inputs and outputs, we obtain the Eq.\n\n3.35, which describes output mainly as a function of the percolation and outflow spillway\n\ngeometry. Dividing the flood hydrograph propagation into discrete intervals of width ?t, the\n\ncontinuity equation is integrated during each interval, providing the retained volume in the\n\ndevice. In this paper, we used the tabular method with automation in BIRENICE.\n\n+ =0 Eq. 3.34?? = ? ? , Eq. 3.35\nWhere: St is storage volume; It represents inputs (runoff (Qin) and rainfall directly in  the bioretention cell); Ot\nrepresents the outputs corresponding to the outflow (Qout); and fTC,t corresponds to soil percolation.\n\nApplying the previously described parameters, each bioretention cell should be sized\n\nto meet specific runoff reduction and retention goals. Any considerations should be based\n\nupon its individual layout.\n\n3.3 Case Study \u2013 Field Application\n3.3.1 Study site\n\nThe field application of the proposed simulation method was made for a micro\n\ndrainage system located at Campus - Area 2 of University of S\u00e3o Paulo, located in S\u00e3o\n\nCarlos, SP, Brazil (Figure 3.4). The study area is located in the sub-basin that belongs to S\u00e3o\n\nCarlos\u2019s urban basin, but with different soil occupancy levels, since it is located on a still-\n\nexpanding campus. Figure 3.5 shows contribution area layout, indicating the paths that\n\ncontribute to runoff. The sub-basin has a total area of 2,3 ha.\n\n\n\n42\n\nFigure 3.4 - Application field of experimental bioretention system - the red point represents its location in\nthe Mineirinho sub-basin, which comprises S\u00e3o Carlos urban basin.\n\nFigure 3.5 - Bioretention implementation area - a) Map of the Campus \u2013 Area 2 of USP- S\u00e3o Carlos,\ncontaining all eight basins proposed for a bioretention technique installation; b) Contribution area scheme\n\nScenarios were developed projecting the size of the campus at pre development (year\n\n1900), current (year 2013) and future (year 2025); the existent bioretention cell was\n\nincrementally expanded.\n\nOverall, the retention catchments are sized based on a quota limit, which aims to the\n\nvolume that is reached when critical flow occurs. In the case of bioretention cell, it also scales\n\nto a critical flow to be transferred to the receiving body. However, in this case, as the goal is\n\nto restore pre-settlement patterns to avoid impacts on the adopted downstream critical flow, it\n\nis that which of them had for the natural environment. For this case study, the 1900 scenario\n\nrepresents the natural environment.\n\nOtherwise, the site of application is in the expansion process and is not fully\n\noccupied, according to his master plan. Thus, it is important to establish scenarios to assess\n\nhow the progressive increase in the land use and occupation impact the runoff production.\n\nConsidering this forecast, the method developed also scales future modular expansions to\n\nmeet increased demands due to changes in land use.\n\n1\n\n\n\n43\n\n3.3.2 Determination of model parameters\n\nHydrological Risk and Return Period\n\nAccording to the Drainage Manual and Stormwater Management (S\u00e3o Paulo, 2012)\n\nfor microdrainage, it is recommended to use return period values ranging between 2 to 10\n\nyears. Tucci et al. (1993) and Tucci et al. (1995) also recommend that, for micro drainage\n\narticles, time ranging used stays between 2 to 10 yeas. Considering the Brazilian situation and\n\nits financial constraints, long-term investments t imply high construction costs. Thus, Tucci et\n\nal. (1993) recommends different values of Tr for various occupations and, for occupancy by\n\npublic buildings, it is recommended the value of 5 years. Thus, it was selected a value of 5\n\nyears, representing medium hydrological risk. The hydrological risk was calculated based on\n\nEq. 3.36.=1? 1? Eq 3.36\nRainfall intensity\n\nUsing the IDF curve (Eq. 3.20), parameters proposed by Barbassa (1991) for the city\n\nof S\u00e3o Carlos, it was possible to calculate rainfall intensity relative to the application field. In\n\nEq. 3.36, i (mm/h) represents rainfall intensity; T (years) is return period; and t (min) is rain\n\nduration.\n\n=1519 ? ,( +16 , ) Eq.3.37\nRain duration\n\nTo estimate total precipitation, departing from rainfall intensity, it was used a 20-\n\nminute rainfall duration. To select the time of precipitation, the precipitation intensity\n\nvariations were studied as a function of time t of precipitation and the return time Tr by\n\nvarying them. It was observed that from the time t 25min, the precipitation intensity curves\n\nfor different Tr are almost coincident. As Barbassa (1991) noted, the more frequent rain time\n\nin the city of S\u00e3o Carlos is 20 min.\n\n\n\n44\n\nContributing drainage area and occupation scenarios\n\nWe delineated the contributing drainage areas using an updated version of Campus \u2013\n\nArea 2 map and field visits - some during rain period, for better observation of the\n\ncontribution of the sub-basins and its limits.  We also manually completed the delineations\n\nusing AutoCAD 2010. The contribution area has a total of 2.3ha.\n\nThe updated map of Campus \u2013 Area 2 also comprises existing buildings, the\n\nbuildings in construction and those approved for construction in the near future. Given the\n\nobvious lack of information corresponding to the completion of construction, all of these\n\nareas were considered as complete in 2013. Additionally, the map shows the Permanent\n\nPreservation Areas (APP), a strict conservation area, which comprises, among others,\n\nriverbanks, to some extent proportional to the river width. The non-occupied areas and those\n\noutside the APPs were classified as pasture, due to the vegetation in the area, once it is\n\nundergrowth and predominantly Brachiaria sp. According to the campus master plan, the\n\nfuture occupation scenario was assumed to be at 50% in 2025, 75% in 2050 and 85% in 2100.\n\nTo simulate the past scenario, setting the year 1900 as reference, the entire area was assumed\n\nto consist of native forest.\n\nSoil properties\n\nThe determination of the soil type was based on particle size analysis. According to\n\nthe distribution curve of ground particle size, the soil belongs to group C - loamy soils with\n\ntotal clay content of 20% to 30% - but with no impervious clay layer or containing rocks at\n\ndepths up to 1.2m. For forested areas, it was forests in poor condition, with CN 77. The\n\noccupied areas were considered industrial districts (72% waterproofing) with CN 91. For the\n\npasture areas, it was adopted CN 79, pasture in average conditions. For APP, there were\n\nadopted CN 73, forest in good condition in 2013, and in the years 2025, 2050 and 2100, forest\n\non bad terms with CN 77.\n\nInfiltration tests were also carried out in the original soil of the area, for further\n\nidentification of flow percolation. As results, the hydraulic conductivity coefficient was\n\n1.62x10-4 cm.s-1, which classified the soil as low permeability.\n\n\n\n45\n\nFiltration media material\n\nAs filtering material it was selected a composition of a 0.70 m gravel layer and a 2 m\n\nsand layer. These materials have the respective 45% and 30% as % empty.\n\n3.3.3 HEC-HMS simulation\n\nIn order to verify the applicability for the proposed method, we compared it with\n\nanother numerical model, Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS 3.5) (USACE, 2010).\n\nHEC-HMS is a rainfall-runoff model, which allows simulations in concentrated or semi-\n\ndistributed forms. It has been successfully used in impacts caused by climate change and land\n\nuse change in small basins studies (MEENU, et al., 2012; SAMIRAN, et al., 2012;\n\nSIMONOVIC, 2010; McENROE, 2010; CUNDERLIK, 2005).\n\nFor the simulation with HEC-HMS, the study used the curve number method in order\n\nto determine effective rainfall and peak flow. The same two scenarios were adopted: with land\n\nuse in 1900 as a period of unchanged vegetation and the altered (urbanized) scenario\n\nprojected to 2013 - 2025, both represented by the change in CN values in each simulation.\n\nWe also propose the evaluation of the catchment\u2019s response to a 20-minute rainfall\n\nevent of 10-year return period, same parameters as BIRENICE. For the simulation, we\n\nassumed a short-term water balance in order to estimate the bioretention cell\u2019s size. In the\n\nHEC-HMS structure, a reservoir represents the bioretention cell at the output, composed by a\n\ntriangular spillway. The useful volume of the cell is adopted as the soil empty ratio. A stage-\n\nvolume curve characterizes the cell\u2019s geometry. In this case, the calculation of hydrograms is\n\nmade using the unit hydrogram method and, to quantify the storage and discharge variation, it\n\nis used the Muskingum method.\n\n3.4 Results and Discussion\n\n3.4.1 BIRENICE sizing\n\nThe model was structured to be used with multiple scenarios as opposed to building a\n\nsingle structure to meet a final plan (in 2100). Table 3.2 shows the main results of BIRENICE\n\nmethod (Calculation memorial is attached at the end of this chapter). From the construction\n\narea availability and storage and cell volume calculated, it was determined the practice\n\ndimensions. Initially, only the first module is built, which will meet the first stage (2013-\n\n2025). In 2025, to attend the urbanization expansion, the second module will be recalculated\n\n\n\n46\n\nand built as an expansion of the first one, which will attend the second stage (2025-2050).\n\nThen, in 2050, the same process will be conducted and the third module will be constructed,\n\nwhich will meet the third stage (2050-2100).\n\nThe structure should be built from upstream to downstream, so that the input\n\nstructure can be used in all stages, avoiding rebuilding. The area required for the final plan\n\n(2100) has been put apart since the beginning. Figure 3.6 depicts the scheme by which the\n\nbioretention dimensions are incrementally in expansion with each interaction, sized by the\n\nmethodology described in this paper. In short, for 2025, the first module dimensions are:\n\n12.99 (height) x 5.6 (width) x 3.2 (depth) m. The highlighted area in red shows the modular\n\nexpansion planned. Parameters considered to size all bioretention cell modules and its final\n\ndimensions are in Table 3.2.\n\nFigure 3.6 - Bioretention dimensions considering modular expansion (in red).\n\n1900 2025 2050 2100\n\nCN 85 88 89.2\n\nImpervious area (%) 50% 75% 85%\n\nT (years) 5 5 5\n\nt (minutes) 20 20 20\n\ni (mm/h) 91.7 91.7 91.7\n\nP (mm) 26 26 26\n\nPeak Flow* (m\u00b3/s/mm) 0.027 0.092/1.34 0.133/1.19 0.153/1.15\n\nStorage (m\u00b3) 78.9 128.2 152.2\n\nVcell (m\u00b3) 232.9 378.3 449.0\n\nLength (m) 12.99 21.11 25.05\n\nWidth (m) 5.60 5.60 5.60\n\nDepth (total) (m) 3.20 3.20 3.20\n\n* Peak flow is presented also in equivalent depth relative to the bioretention area.

The results are\n\npresented in Figure 3.7 for the year 2025 (first module - bioretention area of 72.74m\u00b2) (Figure\n\n\n\n47\n\n3.7a), 2050 (second module - bioretention area of 118.22 m\u00b2) (Figure 3.7b) and 2100 (third\n\nmodule\u2013 bioretention area of 140.28m\u00b2) (Figure 3.7c). It has been noted an increasing runoff\n\nfor future scenarios (with increased urbanization) resulting consequently in an increase in\n\nstorage and bioretention cell volume (Table 3.3).\n\nAs for storage, we have observed that the structure reaches its peak around 30 min\n\nfor all scenarios, at the time the outflow starts. The results of simulation module display a\n\nreduction in the peak flow to none and total volume transferred to downstream, accomplishing\n\none of the goals of using LID practices. It also states that the transferred volume difference is\n\nstored in the soil and percolates through the ground, replenishing the groundwater. Therefore,\n\nthere is a water balance closest to pre-urbanization scenario.\n\nFigure 3.7 - Internal water dynamics hydrographs and cumulative volumes obtained with BIRENICE simulation\nfor (a) 2025, (b) 2050 and (c) 2100.\n\nModular sizing conserves limited financial resources and more closely follows future\n\nneeds. Resources are finite; so building a smaller structure leads to a cost reduction;\n\nconsequently, so the saved capital can be spent on other projects. This hedges risk, as the\n\npredictions of future conditions at the campus are by nature uncertain, thus the structure is\n\nsized for immediate needs during each scenario. Predictions can be as close to reality as closer\n\nthey are performed, thus, a three-step sizing was done.

The rainfall\n\nintensity was then calculated, giving a value of 77.87 mm/h.  The comparative results for the\n\nyear 1900 (pre urbanization) and 2025 (first stage) will be presented in this section.\n\nThe comparison between BIRENICE and HEC-HMS was done for the years 1900\n\n(pre-urbanization) and 2025 (corresponding to the first module, therefore, the field\n\nimplantation for monitoring).\n\nWe first determined input hydrographs for the corresponding bioretention cell\n\ncatchment area. Figure 3.8 shows the results obtained with both methods for the years 1900\n\n(pre-urbanization) (Figure 3.8a) and 2025 (Figure 3.8b). It can be noted that, for both\n\nscenarios, the peak flow occur 20 min after the rainfall starts, for BIRENICE and HEC-HMS.\n\nHowever, there is a little difference in hydrograph shape and peak. This difference is\n\nassociated with the different methods used by the two models. Once BIRENICE uses the\n\nrational method triangular hydrograph; HEC-HMS uses the SCS-CN with the unit\n\nhydrograph. Moreover, BIRENICE estimates greater peak flows than HEC-HMS; (Table 3.3).\n\nThe difference between the peak flows of the two methods is lower for a greater level of\n\nurbanization (2025), presenting a percentage difference of 6%.\n\n1900 2025\n\nBIRENICE (mm/h) 4824 1296\n\nHEC (mm/h) 4536 900\n\nDif (mm/h) 288 396\n\nDif (%) 6% 30%\nTable 3.3 - Peak flow comparison between BIRENICE and HEC-HMS method\n\nFigure 3.8 - Comparative inlet hydrographs between BIRENICE (a) and HEC-HMS (b) for 1900 and 2025\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n300\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nP\nre\n\nci\np\n\nit\nat\n\nio\nn\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nIn\nfl\n\now\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n/h\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n1900 2025\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n300\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nP\nre\n\nci\np\n\nit\nat\n\nio\nn\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nIn\nfl\n\now\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n/h\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n1900 2025\n\n\n\n49\n\nThe inflow hydrograph obtained through BIRENICE method was used as input data\n\nto size the bioretention cell, as shown in the previous section. BIRENICE and HEC-HMS also\n\nsimulate the internal water dynamics in the basin for 2025 (Figure 3.9).\n\nFigure 3.9 - Internal water dynamics simulation and cumulative volumes for 2025 with methods (a) BIRENICE\nand (b) HEC-HMS\n\nFor the volume stored in the basin, in 2025, the BIRENICE method gives a storage\n\npeak in 30 min (10 min after the peak flow from inlet hydrograph), presenting a volume value\n\naround 500 mm (Figure 3.9a). After the peak, the storage decreases quickly and continuous\n\ndue to the percolation process. On other hand, for HEC-HMS method the storage peak\n\nvolume is around 1500 mm and occurs in 50 min (30 min after the peak flow from inlet\n\nhydrograph) (Figure 3.9b). The simulations have a difference in the order of 70% as the basin\n\nstorage capacity, for both scenarios, being the most significant difference between the two\n\nmethods. To explain this difference, it should be noted that the HEC-HMS does not have a\n\nspecific option for LID practices, thus simulating the bioretention cell was done through an\n\nadaptation in a reservoir simulation. In this program function, it is not possible to insert\n\npercolation losses directly in the ground, so it was not considered. Therefore, in Figure 3.9b\n\nthe storage reaches its peak and remains constant, as for BIRENICE it is noted the decrease in\n\ntime and less important storage peak, once the percolation represents a water loss.\n\nTo value the behavior storm of the bioretention technique, the calculations of the\n\nhydric concentration were done and the results were introduced in Table 3.4 . Note that both\n\nBIRENICE and HEC show no outflow during the event.

You can also\n\nnote that for BIRENICE, despite having a peak of expressive flow, the runoff that enters the\n\ntechnique fully percolates, helping to restore the water balance of pre-urbanization. The HEC,\n\nin turn, does the forecast percolated volume. It is estimated that all the runoff is stored in\n\nbioretention basin, leading to the storage\u2019s highest peak.\n\nEquivalent depth (mm)\n\nPrecipitation Inflow Outflow Percolated Storage peak\n\nBIRENICE\n\n2025\n\n26\n\n5.1 0 5.1 1.6\n\n2050 7.3 0 7.3 2.0\n\n2100 8.4 0 8.4 2.2\n\nHEC-HMS 2025 26 4.8 0 - 4.8\nTable 3.4 - Comparative water balance for both models\n\nWith this comparison, it is clear that the differences in simulations for both methods\n\nare small, which corroborates for using the developed method (BIRENICE) for future\n\napplications, since it is targeted to bioretention basin. However, the study recommends further\n\ncomparison of its simulation with data obtained by monitoring the practice in the field for\n\nactual method confirmation.\n\n3.4.3 Comparison between to the sizing methods described\n\nThe BIRENICE method was executed based on the effective precipitation difference\n\nprojected in a year and standing urbanization period for peak flow retention. The simulation\n\nshowed that the module design is efficient so that the entire volume of accumulated rain is\n\nretained in a bioretention bowl. This result can be confirmed by the simulation performed on\n\nHEC-HMS, confirming the applicability of the method.\n\nIt performed a comparative evaluation between the scaling performed by the\n\nproposed method (BIRENICE) with the methods presented by Silveira &amp; Goldenfun (2007),\n\nSizing by runoff retention by Akan &amp; Houghtalen (2003) Sizing by pollutant charge retention\n\nand (McAuley, 2009) Sizing by bioretention. The results are shown in Table 3.4, which are\n\nmatched dimensions and volumes obtained from each useful as a storage volume. It is\n\npossible to observe the runoff sizing methods by the size and retention of the bioretention,\n\nwhich resulted in volumes up to 500% higher than for BIRENICE, as pollution by the sizing\n\nmethod resulted in retention volume close to that BIRENICE.\n\n\n\n51\n\nMethod Equation Reference L (m) B (m) h (m) Vutil (m\u00b3) Vutil/\nVutilbirenice\n\n(%)\n\nEfficiency\n(%)\n\nSizing by\nrunoff\nretention\n\nEq 3.1 to 3.4 Silveira &amp;\nGoldenfun\n(2007).\n\n29 10 1,4 406,8 - 473 97\n\nSizing by\npollutant\ncharge\nretention\n\nEq 3.5 to 3.9 Akan &amp;\nHoughtalen\n(2003) and\nHatt et al.\n(2009)\n\n10 6 1,4 79,5 +92 88\n\nSizing by\nbioretention\ndevice\n\nEq 3.10 to\n3.13\n\nMcAuley\n(2009)\n\n29,5 10 1,4 412 - 479 55\n\nBIRENICE 12 5,6 3,2 86 - 100\n\nTable 3.5 - Comparative results of sizing methods (see equations and criteria in the text)\n\nIn Table 3.5, it is possible to analyze the calculated efficiencies presented for each\n\nmethod, using the empirical data presented about the area and compare it with the BIRENICE\n\nmethod. For Sizing method by runoff retention, it was reached an efficiency of 97% retention\n\nof runoff volume. The Sizing methods by pollutant retention and Sizing charge by device\n\nbioretention have an efficiency of 88% and 55% respectively. It is noteworthy that for these\n\ntwo methods, the efficiency was considered only for parameter SS of solids.\n\nNote that the useful volume calculated is quite different, which would entail the\n\nconstruction of a system with different relations and dimensions. So, the research considered\n\nthe specific area to be built as well, proposing an easily applicable system, which does not\n\ndemand large investments in infrastructure and is easy to perform and understand. It was built\n\na system which has advantages regarding to the qualitative treatment, using a pre-treatment\n\nprimarily to retain sediment and solids. It is also considered a deeper system than the\n\nconventional one, with a significant filter layer, which, consequently, increases the area\n\nstorage.\n\nDespite the significant difference, simulations made by BIRENICE and HEC-HMS\n\nshowed that the dimensions obtained are able to retain all the flow. All in all, these other\n\nmethods have a greater number of variables and, sometimes, it is difficult to determine (such\n\nas b the Akan method) the results, becoming complex to implement. The large volume\n\nestimated by these methods also makes deployment costs higher.\n\nCompensatory techniques are implemented and disseminated as part of public\n\npolicies in countries with financial constraints. Thus, it is necessary that its design method be\n\nsimpler to use and with lower deployment costs, especially when compared to conventional\n\nsystems. Considering this, the BIRENICE method, which uses the difference of effective\n\nrainfall, meets these needs and limitations when compared to other methods, without losing\n\nefficiency.\n\n\n\n52\n\n3.5 Conclusion\n\nThe objective of this research was to propose a design method for a bioretention cell\n\nthat addresses system sizing and uses a computational model to perform evaluation.  This\n\nmethod is proposed as an alternative technology for improving the performance of urban\n\ndrainage systems. The case study was conducted in a drainage area located at Campus - Area\n\n2 of USP S\u00e3o Carlos.\n\nThe bioretention cell designed for this basin was sized for a 5-year return period,\n\nseeking to attenuate peak flow and to reduce runoff volume. A 20-minute rainfall was used in\n\nBIRENICE method and the eventual bioretention cell was sized in a way that no overflows\n\nwould occur during the next 5 years. Device storage peak occurs shortly after the hydrograph\n\nrunoff peak and the structure emptying time is around 50 minutes for all scenarios. The\n\noutflow passing through the spillway, in all cases, is null. It represents an output hydrograph\n\ntemporal rearrangement, because of the bioretention device. The comparison to the HEC-\n\nHMS method was used to validate the results obtained by the computational model.\n\nWe conclude that:\n\n? The sizing and simulation method proposed, BIRENICE, has little difference\n\nwith HEC-HMS results. Therefore, it is an efficient method and recommended for further\n\nresearch of the presented topic.\n\n? BIRENICE method allows planned sizing for future expansion, called modular\n\nsizing. Thus, it also allows lower initial investment and appropriateness to the objective\n\ndimensions.\n\n? Inside its simulation, it is included storage decay, through percolation process.\n\n? It is easy to use the model, which was designed to subtropical areas, but also\n\nallows the user to customize the parameters for local needs.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support of the projects: (1) MAPLU2 - Stormwater\nManagement in Urban Environment/FINEP, (2) Thematic Project 2008/15161-1 FAPESP\n\u201cAssessment of Impacts and Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil and Strategies for\nAdaptation Options\u201d (3) Casadinho/PROCAD CNPq 552494/2011-9 (UFAL-EESC / USP)\n\u201cAdvanced monitoring of biotechnological processes and environmental quality\u201d and (4)\nCNPq 307637/2012-3 of Scientific Productivity.\n\n\n\n53\n\nReferences\n\nAKAN, O &amp; HOUGHTALEN, R, 2003.

BIORETENTION AS A CONTROL TO URBAN DRAINAGE SYSTEM WITH\nAN ECOHYDROLOGICAL BASE: GIS AS A TOOL ON DECISION MAKING\n\nAbstract\n\nEcohydrology indicators stand out as tools for analyzing the human connection with the\nenvironment. Such indicators, together with cleared technology of Geographic Information\nSystems (GIS) can assist in planning the sustainable use of urban areas susceptible to\nflooding. In this regard, the present research demonstrates, using GIS tools, along with the\nstudy of ecohydrology indicators a more precise analysis of likely areas to build bioretention\ntechniques. The study area is located in S\u00e3o Carlos- S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Brazil. It can be verified,\nwith the results of the comparison between the scaling method proposed, BIoREteNtIon CEll\nmethod - BIRENICE, and the consolidated model, Hydrologic Engineering Center -\nHydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS), that the proposed method is, in fact, effective.\nThis affirmation is based upon the good results found in both parameters analysis, qualitative\nand quantitative. Through GIS, it is possible to obtain further details of the concerning area,\nconsidering the terrain peculiarities as waterproof cutouts, vegetated areas and the distance\nfrom water bodies, favoring the magnitude analysis of the impact the bioretention\nimplementation technique considering a temporal evolution of the use and occupation of the\narea between 2004 and 2014. The results of the qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the\nimplemented system showed a considerable improvement in the analyzed parameters, thus,\ncontributing to the sustainability of the watershed. Through maps, it was possible to observe\nchanges in land use and occupation, identifying decreased features related to area\npermeability. The image processing favored quantification. That, therefore, favored\ncalculation through a natural runoff coefficient method in conjunction with the rational\nmethod. From the preparation of flow scenarios, it was possible to observe the extents of the\nimpact on the runoff, land use and occupation. It is concluded that this methodology is\nefficient and can be considered as a support tool for watersheds management.\n\nKeywords: GIS, bioretention, ecohydrology, urban drainage, land use.\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nSince the 1960s, the urban drainage started to appear as a solution to public policies.\n\nConsidering this, master plans started to aim the development bases aligned with the\n\nprotection of the natural resources. The attention of researchers and technicians tended to\n\ntranscend the water courses to tackle problems from an external approach. This happened\n\nmainly because of the development (Geldof, 1995; Pompeo, 2000).\n\nContinuous urban development has resulted in a number of negative environmental\n\nimpacts. An example of impact this is the increase in impermeable areas (Hatt et al., 2004)\n\nreflecting on the increase of surface runoff (Wenguer et al, 2009; Debusk, Hunt &amp; Line, 2010)\n\nand the carriage of pollutants to water bodies, compromising the natural ecosystems\n\n(Cianfrini, Hession &amp; Rizzo, 2006).\n\n\n\n64\n\nThe increase in the use of impermeable surfaces that follows urban growth in recent\n\ndecades has raised the volume of drained rainwater and pollution that is carried from these\n\nwaters to the receiving water bodies. Therefore, the management of stormwater in urban areas\n\nhas become a priority for new planning projects and urban water managements (Lucke &amp;\n\nNichols, 2015).\n\nThe bioretention techniques for urban drainage systems transpas the mitigation\n\npotential impacts caused by urbanization, promoting the improvement of the water quality\n\nstemmed from catchments (Barbosa et al., 2012), considering the different levels of\n\ndevelopment of urban infrastructure. Therefore, these techniques can generate alternatives for\n\nthe management of water resources and environmental protection (Azami et al, 2015; Colson,\n\n2015; Liu et al, 2015; Gessner et al, 2014; McCleary &amp; Hassan., 2008).\n\nBioretention systems have been widely implemented in urban areas over the past\n\ndecade to manage stormwater, reducing peak flows and downstream pollution loads (Lucke &amp;\n\nNichols, 2015). Part of the reason for the recent popularity of bioretention systems is the\n\nflexibility of its design, that helps with its relatively simple integration in existing urban areas.\n\nThey are also considered supplement to a range of benefits, in addition to the conventional\n\nfunctions of stormwater management, also including aesthetic and social benefits (Chahal et\n\nal., 2016). Bioretention systems are generally systems based on plants and soil that typically\n\nconsists of a filter media (typically sand) and also comprises a drainage layer of gravel (Li &amp;\n\nDavis, 2016; Sample &amp; Lucas, 2014). The systems can be assembled with any type of\n\ngeotextile to allow infiltration or include a waterproof lining to help capturing rainwater and\n\nreuse it (FAWB, 2009). Bioretention systems treats stormwater through a range of physical,\n\nchemical and biological processes. These include mechanical filtration, sedimentation,\n\nadsorption, absorption plant and microbial (Mullane, et al., 2015).\n\nAlthough promising, there are still some difficulties in the implementation of\n\nbioretention techniques to consider. Some variables, such as: proximity to water bodies, built-\n\nup areas and preservation areas, soil type, contribution points and climatic characteristics of\n\nthe region should be observed and studied thoroughly to meet the specific standards to\n\nenhance the process\u2019s efficiency. (Dokulil, 2015).\n\nIn parallel, the ecohydrology emerges as a tool that assists the understanding of\n\nhydrological mechanisms (Zalewski, 2002) through ecological paths and processes and must\n\nobserve the dynamics of ecological systems, hydrology and types of land use and occupation\n\nby establishing connections between them (Liu, 2011; Zalewski, 2000; Zalewski et al, 2016.).\n\n\n\n65\n\nGeoprocessing tools help in urban planning and managing areas in its several aspects,\n\nallowing the interpretation of satellite and mapping of urban areas images, showing different\n\nlevels of details and spatial spectrum (Martin-Mikle et al., 2015).\n\nIn this perspective, the objective of this study is to evaluate the susceptibility of the\n\narea to the implementation of compensatory techniques through ecohydrological and\n\ngeoprocessing base. The methodology addresses the observation of local characteristics, the\n\ninflow of catchment area, building bioretention systems, water quality in the system and its\n\npossible interference with the basin. In case of flood events, the assessment is technically\n\nguided with the use of GIS to raise images and maps that describes pre-established situations\n\nand future scenarios, determining the CN (Curve Number) average for sub-areas.\n\n4.2 Methods\n\nThe data and information collection needed for this study involved the following\n\nsteps: (I) Identification of areas that are adversely affected by flooding events; (II) Defining\n\nthe time interval needed to assess growth and urbanization of the area from satellite images;\n\n(III) construction of thematic maps from digital images to identify different situations using a\n\ngeoprocessing tool, so that the identified classes were represented spatially.\n\nFive categories of classification related to land use were created: I) existing forest\n\ncover; II) used area for reforestation for commercial purposes; III) area occupied by buildings;\n\nIV) paved areas for people to transit; and V) areas with low vegetation and bare ground.\n\nThe treatment and digital processing were performed using ArcMap 9.1 software,\n\none component of ArcGis platform of ESRI. The GIS incorporated dataframe layers for\n\nPermanent Preservation Areas (APP) and Legal Reserve Area (RL). The Hydro APP layers\n\nwere developed in consideration of a 50-meter distance from the source and a 30-meter\n\ndistance from draining areas. These distances follow the guidelines established on the new\n\nBrazilian Forest Code (BRAZIL, 2012). A polynomial file was created and the types of land\n\ncover were delimited (I to V described above). Through some image analysis of Google\n\nEarth\u00ae from 2004 and 2010, a comparison can be made and, thus, assess the incremental\n\nchange year by year.\n\n\n\n66\n\n4.2.1 Study Area\n\nThe selected study area is located in the city of S\u00e3o Carlos in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013\n\nBrazil, and makes part of Mineirinho\u2019s River Basin. The Mineirinho River supplies 40% of\n\nthe water demand of the city of S\u00e3o Carlos (Figure 4.1).\n\nFigure 4.1 - Location map for the Mineirinho\u2019s River basin inside S\u00e3o Carlos\n\nCampus Area 2 of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo - USP - S\u00e3o Carlos has an area of\n\napproximately 73 ha, which started to be developed during the late 90s. An additional 29.4 ha.\n\nwas added to create a total campus size of 102.4 ha., when the university officially opened on\n\nApril 11 th, 2005. Along side the construction of the university, legal reserves and APPs were\n\nrecovered. (BENINI, 2005; PUSP-SC, 2015).\n\nSupport surveys indicate that the current campus drainage system is insufficient, as\n\nperiodically several areas of the campus flood during year events. Eight critical areas with\n\ninadequate drainage were identified. The implementation of Compensatory Techniques (CTs)\n\nin these points can excel as a solution, being investigated in the present work.\n\nThe Mineirinho River did not receive a classification by appropriate agencies.\n\nHowever, in consideration of its current conditions in accord with the method developed by\n\nZaffani (2013), Negr\u00e3o (2015) and Apr\u00edgio (2012),  we considered that this river is a class 2.\n\nAccording to the Resolution No. 357 of March 17th, 2005 of the Brasilian National\n\nEnvironment Council - CONAMA, which established criteria for the classification of surface\n\n2047 km\n\n\n\n67\n\nwater bodies and environmental guidelines for its framework, as well as the conditions and\n\neffluent discharge Standards, waters from Class 2 Rivers may be used for:\n\na) The supply for human consumption after conventional treatment;\nb) The protection of aquatic communities;\nc) The primary contact recreation such as swimming, water skiing and diving;\nd) The irrigation of vegetables, fruit trees and parks, gardens, sports and leisure\nfields, with which the public might have a direct contact with;\ne) Aquaculture and fishing activity.\n\n4.2.2 Runoff Calculation \u2013 CN Method\n\nOne of the simplest and most used methods to estimate runoff volume (effective\n\nrainfall) resulting from a rainfall event is the method developed by the National Resources\n\nConservation Service of the U.S. (1972) (formerly Soil Conservation Service - SCS). In this\n\nmethod, after determining the total drained volume, one must calculate the peak flow. The\n\nDrainage City Manual of S\u00e3o Paulo (S\u00e3o Paulo, 2012) recommends the use of rational\n\nmethod for basins with less than 3 km\u00b2. As the application of bioretention catchments occurs\n\neven in microdrainage level, the recommendations of the manual and the rational method for\n\ncalculating the drained peak flow were used. First, it was calculated from the total runoff\n\nvolume from the determination of effective precipitation, based on Eq. 4.1 and 4.2.\n\n>0.2 ? = ( ?0.2 )+0.8 ; ? 0.2 ? =0 Eq 4.1\n= 25400?254 Eq 4.2\n\nWhere: P is the total precipitation in the \u00e1rea; Pe is the effective precipitation; S (mm) is the ground retention\npotential, and CN is the coefficient nunber.\n\nThe CN value depicts the conditions and the soil coverage, varying from a very\n\npermeable cover (lower limit value = 0) to a completely impervious cover (upper limit value\n\n= 100). The values were tabulated and the hydrologic group of soil and its use and occupation\n\nwere used as input data. For cases that there are more than one group of soil or use and\n\noccupation, the value of CN was obtained by Eq. 4.3.\n\n=? \u00d7? Eq 4.3\nWhere is the i-th portion of the basin which has the coefficient ; is the coefficient of the i-th portion\nof the basin.\n\n\n\n68\n\nThe drained peak flow was then calculated using the rational method. The\n\ndetermination of runoff coefficient (C) results from the ratio between the total precipitation\n\nvolume and the total drained volume, i.e. the ratio between the precipitation and effective\n\nprecipitation, as shown in Eq. 4.4 (Kawatoko, 2012). This ratio represents the percentage of\n\ngeneration of surface runoff for the contribution area of interest. From the C relating to the\n\ncontribution area and the intensity of rainfall, one can obtain the drained peak flow as Eq. 4.5.\n\n= Eq 4.4= . . Eq 4.5\n4.2.3 Water quality\n\nNext, the improvement in runoff quality as a result of the bioretention system must\n\nbe estimated. Samples were collected upgradient of the bioretention system (Figure 4.2a),\n\nwithin the bioretention \u2013system, here called \u201cstorage\u201d (Figure 4.2b) and downgradient of the\n\nbioretention system  (Figure 4.2c). At the upgradient location, samples were collected every\n\nfive minutes by an autosampler in order to obtain the concentration on the washoff load\n\nfollowing the procedure of SILVA et al. (2009). For storage and downgradient locations,\n\nsamples were collected every 20 minutes throughout the rainfall event.\n\nFigure 4.2 - Collecting point for water samples a) input; b) storage, and C) output.\n\nThe mass balance, in order to calculate the efficiency of the bioretention system, was\n\ndone through Eq. 4.6, adapted from Erickson et al. (2013).( )= ( + )?( ( )+ ( )) Eq. 4.6\n\n1 km\n\n\n\n69\n\nWhere: Ms(t) = Polutant\u2019s mass stored inside the bioretention system; Min(t) = Inflow polutant\u2019s mass trough\nrunoff; MP(t) = Inflow polutant\u2019s mass trough precipitation; MI(t) = Polutant\u2019s mass infiltrated/treated by the CT;\nMout(t) = CT\u2019s Outflow polutant\u2019s mass; t = interval time.\n\nThe studied water quality variables were chosen based upon references from the\n\nbasic literature. Some works, such as Barbassa (2011) and Vasconcelos (2008), featuring the\n\nrainwater drained by a roof in the peripheral region of S\u00e3o Carlos and the main pollutants,\n\nwere the typical ones of organic contamination by nutrients and metals.\n\nCurrently, a great part of studies conducted in this area, analysed the CT\u2019s effects on\n\nmetal treatment. (WANG et al., 2016; WANG et al., 2015; HATT et al., 2009). Therefore, in\n\norder to compare the efficiency of the bioretention system in other places, iron \u2013 Fe, zinc \u2013\n\nZn, lead - Pb, nickel - Ni, manganese - Mn copper - Cu, chromium - Cr and cadmium \u2013 Cd,\n\nsome parameters were selected as metal contamination of quality variables.\n\nThe mass balance\u2019s time control and the period of collection of samples, to\n\ndetermine the concentration, at points 1 and 5, are shown in Table 4.1.\n\nEvent 1 Event 2 Event 3\n\nTime Control 0-123 minutes 0 - 136 minutes 0 - 593 minutes\n\nSamples collected (inflow) 0 - 30 minutes 0 - 26 minutes 0 - 26 minutes\n\nSamples collected (outflow) 1 sample at the minute 6 25 - 45 minutes 0 - 60 minutes\n\nTable 4.1 - Time control and collection times of the events.\n\nThe time control, applied for this balance, was considered the same as the inflow\n\noccurrence duration. However, this period is much longer than the time covered by the sample\n\ncollection, for the concentration measurements. To overcome this issue, the total inlet and\n\noutlet masses, for the events 2 and 3, were calculated through the Event Mean Concentration\n\n(EMC). The EMC is given by Eq. 4.7\n\n= ? . .? = ? . .? Eq4. 7\nWhere the Ct and Qt are the analyzed concentration parameters and the flow rate, at time t, respectively, and\nthe interval of each sample collation.\n\nIn theory, the event load is calculated by Eq. 4.8, and can be simplified to Eq. 4.9:= . .? Eq 4.8= . Eq 4.9\nWhere Qm is the mean flow rate, C the concentration and tc the time control.\n\n\n\n70\n\nThree series of data were obtained from the bioretention system, placed in the\n\nMineirinho\u2019s river watershed, for three rainy events, between the months of August and\n\nSeptember 2015.\n\n4.3 Results and Discussion\n4.3.1 Geoprocessing use\n\nUsing ArcMap 9.1 software we have developed maps for classification of land use\n\nand occupation. For the construction of the maps, we considered images taken in 2004, 2010\n\nand 2014 (Figure 4.3). This period was chosen due to the construction of the university\u2019s\n\ncampus: this area passed through very significant changes in its land use and occupation.\n\nFigure 4.3 - Use and Occupation \u2013 Mapping for 2004, 2010 e 2014.\n\nIn Figure 4.3, it is possible to identify features that indicate a decrease of the\n\npermeable area, which may result in increased formation of sediment targeted to the water\n\nbody.\n\nThe mapping shows the permanence of underbrush and riparian vegetation at the\n\nlocations all over time, showing the preservation of these areas, despite moderate changes in\n\nthe region. So, the bioretention techniques to be adopted should primarily support the\n\npreservation of these areas.\n\nThe identification of changes in the features on the maps as the borders of built-up\n\narea and reforestation indicates changes in both the soil morphology and the areas of use,\n\nwhich implies a decrease in soil permeability. These changes may also be associated with\n\nclimatic variations of the region. Gordon and Meentemeyer (2006) demonstrated, in their\n\nstudy, the effects of urban drainage systems on the ground vegetation. The formation of\n\n\n\n71\n\nclimatic cores in regions, where there are built-up areas facing ciliary forests, are common\n\nand changes the local environment. Thus, the flow associated with soil disturbance causes\n\nmajor impact on local environment.\n\nThe variables identified in the features of the maps strongly justify flood zones and\n\nsuggests that conventional drainage methods would not cause improvements in the region.\n\nThe patterns of the maps suggest that urban drainage techniques for bioretention should\n\nconsider the hydro-geomorphologic and ecohydrological processes and, also, the relationship\n\nbetween discharge and sediment carried in their constructive step.\n\n4.3.2 Use Quantification\n\nThrough the processing of the images, it was possible to identify and quantify the\n\ntypes of soil use and occupation at campus 2 of USP S\u00e3o Carlos (Table 4.2).\n\nArea (m\u00b2) 2004 (m2) 2010 (m2) 2014 (m2)\nBuilt-up Area 2142 22584 36230\nPaved area 36521 72916 111619\nForest cover 85156 179839 184368\nComercial Reforestation Area 36026 17924 4303\nBare or ground vegetation area 863886 730467 687210\n\nTable 4.2 - Evolution of land use at Campus 2 - S\u00e3o Carlos (USP).\n\nBased on the data presented in Table 4.2, it can be observed that there was an\n\nincrease in built-up and paved areas as well as forest coverage area over the years. It is\n\npossible to infer that there was an increase in the sealed area within the campus from the\n\nincrease in paved and built-up areas, which changed from 3.78% to 14.44% of the total area\n\nof the campus. The increase of built-up area reflected in increased soil sealing, raising the\n\nwater runoff. Therefore, there is greater amount of sediment taken at a higher speed to the\n\nreceiver body and it may increase its sedimentation level.\n\nIn 2014, the sealed area was around 14.44% of the total of Campus 2. It was also\n\nidentified that the area of legal reserve represents around 20.7% of the campus. According to\n\nthe Forest Code, the area required by law is 20%, leaving approximately 0.7% of the area\n\nsuitable for further construction of techniques that allows better water runoff such as\n\nbioretention systems.\n\nWhile Evaluating the results with previous research on the characterization of the\n\nMineirinho Stream Basin, in terms of use and occupation, it is clear that Campus 2 followed\n\nthe pattern of occupation of other areas of the basin, with an increase in impervious areas by\n\nconstruction of paved roads and built-up areas. Benini (2005) reports that for the year of 1972\n\n\n\n72\n\nabout 75% of the area comprised pastures and grasses, corresponding to the permeable areas,\n\nwhile little more than 5% corresponded to impervious areas. In 2000 this scenario changed,\n\nincreasing to 35% of impervious areas, with areas of grass reduced to less than half of the\n\ncoverage. Remaining forest areas decreased from just over 10% to approximately 5%. Apr\u00edgio\n\n(2012) reported that in 2012 about 45% of the area was built with 20% grasses.\n\nThe data obtained from the construction of maps for use and occupation land at\n\nCampus 2 demonstrate that, despite following the trend of the surrounding region that also\n\ncomprises the Mineirinho Stream Basin, this site has a moderately accelerated growth,\n\nincreasing about 10%  the permeable areas corresponding to reduction in areas with ground\n\nvegetation. This demonstrates the need for future planning.\n\nArea (m\u00b2) 2004 (m2) 2010 (m2) 2014 (m2)\nForest cover area 65060 96496 96088\nComercial Reforestation Area 78890 48315 48723\nGround vegetation or bare land area 860 0 0\n\nTable 4.3 - Evolution of land uses in the APPs Campus 2 - S\u00e3o Carlos (USP).\n\nArea (m\u00b2) 2004 (m2) 2010 (m2) 2014 (m2)\nForest cover area 19486 57974 83508\nComercial Reforestation Area 188771 153793 128259\nGround vegetation or bare land area 3509 0 0\n\nTable 4.4 - Evolution of land uses in the RL Campus 2 - S\u00e3o Carlos (USP).\n\nTable 4.3 and Table 4.4 present data related to the historical evolution in terms of\n\nareas of legal reserve (RL) and permanent preservation areas (APP), whose objectives are to\n\ncorrelate with the patterns presented by photo-interpretation. In technical terms, there was no\n\nchange in the identification method with the respective collected data, indicating that the\n\npatterns relate to the decrease in drainage area of the region that enables entrainment of solids\n\nto the/a water body. Unlike the surrounding region (Benini, 2005; Apr\u00edgio, 2012), one can\n\nnote that for Campus 2, there was an increase over the years in the area of forest cover and the\n\nAPP and RL ground vegetation were entirely converted to forest vegetation. This behavior\n\ndemonstrates the university administration's concern with the improvement of environmental\n\nquality and commitment to follow the law.\n\n4.3.3 Calculation of runoff\n\nThe confirmation and quantification of an increase in the surface runoff were made\n\nthrough the peak flow calculation using the method CN - SCS conjugate with the rational\n\nmethod. To this end, it was adopted different CN values corresponding to every area of\n\ndifferent land use and occupation. The general CN value was calculated in accordance with\n\n\n\n73\n\nEq. 3 and peak flow. For the runoff, it was calculated from Eq. 4.5. In this calculation, a\n\nrainfall intensity of 91.7mm / hr was considered, calculated from rain time of 20 min (more\n\ncommon for the city of S\u00e3o Carlos) and return period of 10 years, set from the Drainage\n\nManual and Stormwater Management recommendations (S\u00e3o Paulo, 2012) for microdrainage.\n\nWith these input values, the value of precipitation obtained was 30.6mm\n\nFrom the CN distribution calculations and expert analysis, it was considered CN 77\n\nfor forest areas - forests in poor condition. The occupied areas were considered industrial\n\ndistricts (72% waterproofing) with CN 91. For the pasture areas, CN 79 was adopted - pasture\n\nin average conditions. For APP (Area of Permanent Protection), CN 73 was adopted - forest\n\nin good condition.\n\nTo complement the analysis of the increase in runoff with increased urbanization, it\n\nwas also made a forecast for future scenarios of urban drainage condition in the Campus, in\n\nview of the occupations provided by the Master Plan of the Campus Area 2 and the city of\n\nS\u00e3o Carlos. Thus, the CN calculations and drained peak flow were made for the scenarios of\n\n2025 (50% occupancy), 2050 (75% occupancy) and 2100 (85% occupancy) (Figure 4.4). For\n\nthese scenarios the same CN values determined previously were considered, with the\n\nexception of APP areas, which was adopted CN 77, representing forests in poor condition.\n\n14,44%\n\n50%\n\n75%\n\n85%\n\n0,00%\n\n10,00%\n\n20,00%\n\n30,00%\n\n40,00%\n\n50,00%\n\n60,00%\n\n70,00%\n\n80,00%\n\n90,00%\n\n2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 2090 2100 2110\n\nFORECAST FOR OCCUPATION AREA\n\nFigure 4.4 - Forecast for occupation of the area.\n\nTable 4.5 shows the flow scenarios obtained for each of the eight catchments\n\n(contribution areas) that cover the study area. The drained peak flow rates were calculated\n\nbased on the CN values for each contribution area varying according to the percentage of\n\noccupation of the campus. The results presented illustrate how changes in the land use and\n\noccupation affects indeed the runoff. It may be noted that between the years 2014 and 2025,\n\nin which the Campus occupation would double its size, there is a percentage increase in\n\nrunoff ranging from 13% (basin 5) to 100% (basin 7). The maximum expected increase is\n\n214% occurring in the basin 7 for the 2100 scenario, with higher occupancy rate.\n\n\n\n74\n\nBasin\n2014 2025 2050 2100\n\nCN Qpeak (m\u00b3/s) CN Qpeak (m\u00b3/s) CN Qpeak (m\u00b3/s) CN Qpeak (m\u00b3/s)\n1 81,0 0,030 85,0 0,048 88,0 0,065 89,2 0,073\n2 82,0 0,246 85,0 0,346 88,0 0,472 89,2 0,532\n3 81,5 0,126 85,0 0,187 88,0 0,255 89,2 0,288\n4 80,6 0,036 85,0 0,061 88,0 0,083 89,2 0,093\n5 85,6 0,009 86,8 0,010 88,0 0,011 89,2 0,013\n6 83,2 0,118 84,9 0,142 87,9 0,193 88,9 0,214\n7 79,0 0,005 85,0 0,010 88,0 0,014 89,2 0,016\n8 81,3 0,141 85,0 0,215 88,0 0,293 89,2 0,331\n\nTable 4.5 - CN Values for contribution areas.\n\nThe scenarios observed on the maps composition denote a significant increase of the\n\nimpermeable area through the classes that indicate constructed areas and by the objects that\n\nindicate road expansion. Under these conditions, after local consultations, it can be noticed an\n\nincrease in volumes of water running into the river studied. Additionally, the hydrological\n\nperformance can also be compromised over time, because, besides the running, the cycle as a\n\nwhole is influenced by the permeability coefficients.\n\n4.3.4 Bioretention based on ecohydrological principles\n\nThe dimensions of the bioretention system followed the criteria, general efficiencies\n\nand joint performance and can be checked by comparing the qualitative and quantitative\n\nefficiency. In this work, only the qualitative results will be shown, guided by ecohydrological\n\nprinciples, as seen in Figure 4.5, which is illustrative and is not on scale. The diagram shows\n\nthe contribution areas of the studied catchment regarding the bioretention technique. The\n\ninfluence zones that emerge from the urban growth in the region are also considered. The\n\nMineirinho River has dense riparian vegetation and small pockets of water along its route.\n\nThe contribution flow is basically from the campus drainage system and rainwater capture.\n\nAll these components are evaluated in correlation to the ecosystem interactions. Figure 4.6\n\nshows the constructive parameters of implementation of bioretention project.\n\nFigure 4.5 - Influence zones and contribution areas for the bioretention technique.\n\n236 km\n\n\n\n75\n\nFigure 4.6 - Perspective for implanting the bioretention technique\n\n1 km\n\nModular Expansion\n\n\n\n76\n\nThe proposed system allows this temporal evaluation for being modularly\n\ndimensioned. It allows, without much effort, to expand its size over time. This issue has been\n\nconsidered by the fact that the study area is recent and is in full expansion. It is known that the\n\nmore urbanized the space is, the more increased the runoff and, hence, larger the bioretention\n\nsystem must be.\n\n4.3.5 Water quality in Bioretention Systems\n\nSome analysis of water quality were made at three points in this bioretention\n\nexperiment - inlet, storage and outlet - in order to characterize the pollution present in the\n\nsurface runoff and evaluate the efficiency of the technique in removing pollutants. Three\n\nrainfall events were considered, in the months of August and September 2015. The Table 4.6\n\nalso shows, for means, characteristics of events.\n\nDate\nTime start /end\n\nTotal precipitation before sampling (mm) Event total precipitation (mm)\nRainfall Sampling\n\n25/ago 9h42 14h17 10h04 10h50 3.8 5.8\n\n27/ago 14h53 17h47 15h28 17h28 2.4 2.6\n\n08/set 15h59 1h55 (next day) 16h03 17h59 29 39\n\nTable 4.6 - Characteristics of events\n\nThe Table 4.7 shows the EMC obtained for the variables: Fe, Zn, Pb, Ni, Mn, Cu, Cr\n\nand Cd, and shows, for means of comparison, the standards established for the effluent\n\nreleased in a Class 2 river, which is Mineirinho\u2019s class, according to Brazilian Federal\n\nCONAMA 357/2005 resolution. It can be observed that the outlet EMC for Fe, Ni, Cu, and\n\nCd, at all three events, and for Pb, in events 2 and 3, presents higher values than the limits\n\nestablished by the CONAMA. However, the total inlet and outlet mass of the parameters\n\nshould be analyzed to verify the bioretention efficiency and how this system reduces the\n\nimpact on the receiving water body.\n\nEvent 1 Event 2 Event 3 Conama 357\n\nEMC Inlet\n(mg/l)\n\nEMC Outlet\n(mg/l)\n\nEMC Inlet\n(mg/l)\n\nEMC Outlet\n(mg/l)\n\nEMC Inlet\n(mg/l)\n\nEMC Outlet\n(mg/l)\n\nStandars (mg/l)\n\nFe 15.54 36.59 10.71 4.76 0.34 1.74 0.3\n\nZn 0.143 0.123 0.230 0.09 0.09 0.09 0.18\n\nPb 0.05 0.010 0.070 0.02 0.06 0.05 0.01\n\nNi 0.068 0.095 0.070 0.09 0.06 0.11 0.025\n\nMn 0.047 0.040 0.040 0.020 - - 0.1\n\nCu 0.014 0.014 0.020 0.01 - - 0.009\n\nCr&lt;0.005&lt;0.005&lt;0.005&lt;0.005&lt;0.005&lt;0.005 0.005\n\nCd 0.03 0.033 0.03 0.03 0.08 0.08 0.001\n\nTable 4.7 - Event Mean Concentration for pollutants in each event\n\n\n\n77\n\nThe rainfall measurements were 6.0 mm in the first event, 3.0 mm in the second\n\nevent and 39.0 mm in the third event. The Figure 4.7 shows the accumulated and\n\ninstantaneous water depth, generated by these rainfalls, for each event. It can be observed the\n\ninfiltration depth in the bioretention, being the difference of the inlet and outlet the water\n\ndepth. In event one (1) the infiltration rate was approximately 34%, to event two (2) 41% and,\n\nto event three (3), it was 64%. The dashed lines on the graphics delimit the sampling period.\n\nFigure 4.7 - Accumulated and instant depth for events\n\nThe inlet and outlet mass of each parameter analyzed and the removal efficiency are\n\nshown in Table 4.8. It shows the removal efficiency for the monitored events. It is possible to\n\nnotice, for most of the parameters analyzed, that the practice decreases the pollutants load,\n\nthat would have reached the water body, considerably. The chrome concentration measured\n\nwas insignificant and it is not shown in the table.\n\n\n\n78\n\nThe metal removal efficiency varies from 40.3% to 97.8%. Lead was the parameter\n\nwith the higher removal rates (94.0% and 91.8% for the events 1 and 2). Iron had the worst\n\nremoval efficiency: 40.3% in event 1 and it had even, for event 3, a higher outlet mass than\n\ninlet, resulting in a negative efficiency (-74.84 %). This can be explained due to the Brazilian\n\nsoil chemical composition. Due to the geological characteristics and its high weathering levels\n\nin tropical regions, it is common to find high iron oxides in the soils like the one used to the\n\nsuperficial and vegetated layer of the CT in which an erosion occurrence was observed during\n\nthe event 3. Besides the iron, all other metals, in event 3, had a lower removal efficiency when\n\ncompared to the events 1 and 2. The reason may also be related to the soil type in the study\n\narea, latosol and erosion events.\n\nEvent 1 Event 2 Event 3\nLoad\n\nEfficiency\nLoad\n\nEfficiency\nLoad\n\nEfficiency\nIn (g) Out (g) In (g) Out (g) In (g) Out (g)\n\nFe 197.70 117.93 40.3% 71.05 8.85 87,5% 92.57 161.86 -74.8%\n\nZn 1.82 0.40 78.2% 1.50 0.17 88,7% 24.74 8.64 65.1%\n\nPb 0.64 0.03 94.9% 0.46 0.04 91,8% 15.23 4.66 69.4%\n\nNi 0.87 0.31 64.6% 0.47 0.16 65,8% 17.12 10.14 40.8%\n\nMn 0.60 0.01 97.8% 0.23 0.04 83,4% - - -\n\nCu 0.18 0.05 74.7% 0.12 0.01 89,4% - - -\n\nCr - - - - - - - - -\n\nCd 0.38 0.11 72.1% 0.22 0.06 71,9% 20.84 7.80 62.6%\nTable 4.8 - Removal Efficiencies\n\nTo complement the results analysis, a review of the metal removal rates obtained by\n\nother authors was performed. Wang et al. (2016) studied the Cd removal in several filtrating\n\nmaterials and had over 95% of efficiency. Wang et al. (2015) also evaluated the Cu, Pb and\n\nCd removal by filtration of wastes from construction sites and obtained more than 90% of\n\nefficiency. These values are much higher than those found in this study. However,  Wang et\n\nal. (2016) and Wang et al. (2015) did these studies under a laboratorial scale with no\n\nadversities faced in a field experiment. Hatt et al. (2009), otherwise, analysed the removal\n\nefficiency of a bioretention system applied on the field and obtained an efficiency of 67% and\n\n80% for Cu and Pb respectively. It is important to highlight, that the removal efficiency of a\n\nbioretention system varies with its location, due to the different climate conditions and the\n\nfiltrating material characteristics, as the vegetated layer has a great influence on the runnoff\n\ntreatment.\n\nDespite the Mineirinho\u2019s River Basin be classified as a Class 2 ? under Brazilian\n\nlaw, which allows for a more noble use of its waters such as supply for human use and\n\n\n\n79\n\nprimary contact recreation, Apr\u00edgio (2012) found illegal contribution of domestic sewage in\n\nregions on its head. This may contribute to a loss of environmental quality of the basin, an\n\nincrease of pollutant concentration in its water and risks to the surrounding population. Thus,\n\nsome actions to reduce the amount of pollution and consequent improvement in water quality\n\nto match its intended uses are important for this region.\n\n4.4 Conclusion\n\nThe method used for mapping land use and occupation allowed to check and\n\ncompare the increase in the urban area and its interference with the local environment. Hence,\n\nthe criteria to define the study area were satisfactory and provided a study model and\n\ncharacterization of the area - more comprehensive and accurate to select sites for construction\n\nof bioretention techniques - based on ecohydrological principles. The mapping of land use\n\nand occupation groups simplifies the procedures for integrating information regarding the\n\npriority areas for the construction of bioretention systems and the particular characteristics of\n\neach region, providing the implementation of resource of georeferenced bases directed to\n\necohydrological issues.\n\nThe comparative visual analysis allows an initial assessment, although more\n\nsuperficial, on the quality of the method applied to determine the CN. It is clearly noticeable\n\nthat there are bigger CN values in more urbanized areas, where waterproofing percentage is\n\nhigh, associated with soil conditions showing infiltration capacity below the average. The\n\nregions of forests and fields are clear indicators of areas where there is less runoff (lower CN).\n\nThe increase in impermeable areas, even with a slow rate of advancement, increases\n\nthe quantities of sediments during periods of heavy rainfall, making a high input of sediments\n\nin the receiving body, causing the increase of various parameters related to water quality and\n\npeak flow. With the implementation of compensatory techniques, this problem is mitigated,\n\nlowering the impact in water ecosystems downstream of bioretention technique.\n\nThe quality of the output effluent from the bioretention system confirms a significant\n\nimprovement in the analyzed parameters. It was possible to verify that there is a decrease in\n\nthe mass loading and, accordingly, improvement in water quality parameters, which\n\ncontributes to lower of pollutants and contaminants to the receiver. This feature reinforces the\n\ncapacity of treatment of bioretention technique.\n\nGuided by our studies, we can say that applying this methodology to select areas to\n\nimplement bioretention system is efficient and proves, with the data presented, the reduction\n\n\n\n80\n\nof pollutant load directed to the river, being understood that the construction of bioretention\n\ntechniques, in addition make lower impacting to the river, brings benefits to it. This is\n\njustified by the thematic maps, where one can see that there is considerable natural vegetation\n\ncovering the area, as well as areas that were reforested over time. As for the quality of the\n\noutput effluent from the bioretention system, it is possible to verify that there is a significant\n\nimprovement of the analyzed parameters.\n\nThe study clearly shows the importance of using a georeferencing tool for analysis of\n\nareas, since it enables a rapid and consistent analysis of the study area. When correlation\n\noccurs with ecohydrological indicators, the perception of the process efficiency supported\n\nwith physical elements becomes believable when it is noticed. An example is the investigation\n\nof vegetal areas, that together with the results of qualitative parameters, demonstrate that the\n\nimplementation of a bioretention system attenuates the peak flow effects for a specific region.\n\nStudies of this size can support a feasibility analysis and is more accurate in efficiency for\n\nregions with different climatic and physical characteristics.\n\nReferences\n\nAZAMI, K., SUZUKI, H., &amp; TOKI, S.

USING PCSWMM TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF A BRAZILIAN\nMODULAR BIORETENTION DESIGN FOR STORMWATER TREATMENT\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBioretention is a low impact development (LID) practice that has emerged as one of the best\nsolutions for mitigating the impacts of urban development. Prior to characterizing future\nimplementation of these systems, it is necessary to fully evaluate the efficiency of the systems\nalready implemented. This work simulates future scenarios through quali-quantitative\nmonitoring of a bioretention modular experimental system, which can be expanded in order to\ndeal with an increase in output. After developing and calibrating the model, It was used to\nsimulate one recent (2015) and three future (2025, 2050 and 2100) scenarios, based on the\nLID modular design proposed and on the changes in impervious area over the years. This\nevaluation can be assisted by the use of a numerical model, in this case the Storm Water\nManagement Model (SWMM). This model   was used to characterize the hydrology and water\nquality of an upstream subcatchment and downstream bioretention system in S\u00e3o Carlos,\nBrazil. The chosen area has recurrent flooding and water runoff quality issues. The model\nwas calibrated with data from rainfall events that occurred on August and September 2015.\nThe 2015 scenario presented the highest quality and quantity efficiency, with an average of\n90,9 and 91,2% respectively, and in 2025 with the same parameter, the lowest numbers with,\n81,8 and 82,3%. As the results by simulations suggest, the modular sizing methods are\nsufficient to maintain the performance until 2100, with a simulated quantity efficiency of 85,1\nand 89,2% for quality efficiency. The study shows how modular bioretention is an efficiency\nsystem for treat diffuse pollution in urban areas.\n\nKeywords: urban drainage, stormwater, quali-quantitative efficiency, modelling.\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nAs the world\u2019s population grows, urban areas have grown even faster. According to\n\nthe United Nations (2014), approximately 54% of the world population currently lives in\n\nurban areas, which will likely rise to 66% by 2050. Urban development to accommodate this\n\npopulation results in increased imperviousness, altering the natural hydrologic cycle by\n\nreducing infiltration (Elliot &amp; Trowsdale, 2007), depletion of evapotranspiration from\n\nremoval of vegetation (Smith &amp; Banting, 2005), reduction of recharge and base flows because\n\nof the paving of the surface (Loc eta l., 2015), and an increase in runoff volume and peak\n\nflows (Lucas and Sample 2015). Due to the direct connection between urban impervious areas\n\nand the drainage system, the increased frequency and magnitude of runoff is directly\n\nconveyed to some receiving water bodies without attenuation, shortening, because of that, the\n\ntime period to the peak (Sabouri et al., 2013). In addition, pollutants are now washed off more\n\neasily and quickly (Alberti et al., 2007). Streams degrade rapidly as they accommodate the\n\n\n\n84\n\nnew flows and pollutant loads, causing a general decline in aquatic health (Kaushal &amp; Belt,\n\n2012).\n\nThese widespread impacts from urban development can be mitigated by Best\n\nManagement Practices - BMPs, that restore natural conditions by increasing infiltration,\n\nreducing runoff and improving water quality in runoff (Tillinghast &amp; Jennings, 2011;\n\nMangangka et al., 2014; LaBarre et al., 2015; Ghodsi et al., 2016). Houdeshel et al., 2015;\n\nGhodsi et al., 2016; Palanisamy &amp; Chui, 2015; and Lim &amp; Lu, 2016 suggest that runoff\n\nshould be viewed as a resource, transforming it from a waste product through reuse, thus\n\ncreating a more sustainable development practice. These mitigation techniques are\n\ncollectively known as Low Impact Development (LID). In addition to runoff reduction,\n\nimplementing LID may reduce flooding (Klenzendorf et al., 2015), conserve water supplies\n\n(Pongmala et al., 2015) and reduce urban heat islands that are now becoming prevalent in\n\nmany cities (Loc et al., 2015).\n\nBioretention cells are shallow depressions filled with a filtration media and resistant\n\ndrought, but with a hydrophilic vegetation. Their main purpose is to reduce runoff volume\n\nthrough infiltration into surrounding soils, attenuating peak flows through available storage\n\nand improving discharge water quality through filtration (Smith &amp; Banting, 2005; Liu et al.,\n\n2012; Lucas &amp; Sample, 2015). The extent of these benefits depends on some hydraulic and\n\nhydrologic factors of the upstream subcatchment and bioretention design.\n\nThe urban center of S\u00e3o Carlos, (the location of this study), currently experiences a\n\nhigher flood frequency, due to urbanization and discontinuities in the drainage system.\n\nImperviousness in the city varies from 55% to 100%, with resulting curve numbers (CN) from\n\n58 to 95 (Zaffani, 2012). The Mineirinho\u2019s River, which accounts for 40% of supply from S\u00e3o\n\nCarlos, experiencing significant flooding as well as poor water quality.\n\nTo explore the benefits of implementing LID practices to remediate drainage and\n\nwater quality issues in S\u00e3o Carlos, a bioretention system was installed in Campus 2 of\n\nUniversity S\u00e3o Paulo, in an area experiencing high runoff peak flows. In order to evaluate this\n\nsystem, understanding the influence of the hydraulic and hydrological factors of the upstream\n\nsubcatchment and the bioretention cell on treatment performance is needed (Mangangka et al.,\n\n2014; Sample et al., 2012). A computational model provides a tool to accomplish this goal,\n\nbecause of its ability to generalize system behavior and explore variations in design and other\n\nspatial and temporal factors (Smith &amp; Banting, 2004; Sample &amp; Liu, 2014). The North-\n\nAmerican EPA\u2019s Storm Water Management Model or SWMM (Rossman, 2014) is a broad\n\ncomputational model for water quality and quantity analysis of urban drainage (Loc et al.,\n\n\n\n85\n\n2015; Sample et al., 2012). This model was chosen for simulating the deployed bioretention\n\nsystem and its upstream subcatchment due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, and its\n\nexplicit hydraulic simulation of channels and pipes (Talbot et al., 2016). SWMM simulates\n\nrainfall-runoff response of a watershed, given precipitation and other meteorologial inputs and\n\npredicts the quantity and quality of the runoff (Sovan et al., 2015; Smith &amp; Banting, 2004).\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of urban development in the\n\nflow during storm events and verify the effectiveness of a bioretention project in particular,\n\nand to generally assess LID application through computer modeling, evaluating interference\n\nthe bioretention technique on both the quality and quantity of the drained water.\n\n5.2 Materials and Methods\n\n5.2.1 Study area\n\nThe area of study comprises the campus 2 of University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in S\u00e3o Carlos,\n\nBrazil, which is approximately 102,4 ha, and is located approximately 203 km in the central-\n\neastern region of S\u00e3o Paulo state. (Figure 5.1). About 30% of the area surrounding the campus\n\nis classified as environmental protected area. The region is a tributary of the Mineirinho\n\nRiver, whose length is approximately 4 km, surrounded by native vegetation, forest areas and\n\nurban areas.\n\nThe region incorporates 86% of the permanent preservation area and 14% of the\n\nprotection area. Rapid growth of the campus has caused deficiencies in the drainage system,\n\nresulting in floods and erosion of stream channels and streambanks. The subject bioretention\n\nhas a contributing drainage area of 2,3ha, and covers 63 m2.\n\nFigure 5.1 - Location of the study area.\n\n\n\n86\n\n5.2.2 Used Data\n\nThe hydraulic components of the upstream subcatchment and bioretention system,\n\n(e.g., Manning\u2019s roughness coefficient, hydraulic width, slope, inverts, etc.) were estimated\n\naccording to a site survey and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of spatial data.\n\nHydro meteorological data included precipitation and temperature. Precipitation was\n\nmeasured by two rain gauges on the campus. The data were verified for homogeneity using a\n\ndouble mass verification method, which compared stations operated by the National Institute\n\nof Meteorology (INMET) with those from the National Center for Monitoring and Warning\n\nNatural Disasters (CEMADEN). Other meteorological data collected included wind,\n\natmospheric pressure and temperature from the Center of Weather Forecasting and Climate\n\nStudies (CPTEC/INPE).\n\nWater quality samples were taken based upon the methodology proposed by Macedo\n\net al. (2015). Sample were collected from fixed locations, and were made by an automatic\n\nsampler at the entrance of the bioretention system and manually in all other points. Collected\n\nsamples were analyzed in a laboratory for nitrogen, in form of nitrate and nitrite, chemical\n\noxygen demand (COD), phosphate, iron, zinc, cadmium, lead and nickel using the analytical\n\nmethod recommended by Standard Methods (APHA, 1999).

The USEPA Storm Water Management Model\n\n(SWMM) is a computer program that computes dynamic rainfall-runoff for single event and\n\nlong-term (continuous or period-of-record) runoff quantity and quality from developed urban\n\nand undeveloped or rural areas. The runoff component of SWMM operates on a collection of\n\nsubcatchment areas that receive precipitation and generate runoff and pollutant loads. The\n\n\n\n87\n\nrouting portion of SWMM transports this runoff overland and underground through a system\n\nof pipes, channels, storage and treatment devices, pumps and regulators. SWMM tracks the\n\nquantity and quality of runoff generated within each subcatchment and the flow rate, flow\n\ndepth and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period comprised of\n\nmultiple time steps. The Figure 5.2 show a flowchart modeling with PCSWMM.\n\nFigure 5.2 - Flowchart of the methodological steps of the research in PCSWMM.\n\nA digital elevation model (DEM) was developed based on satellite image. DEM and\n\nan aerial photography with 1 m and 0,2 m horizontal resolution, respectively, were used as a\n\ndata sources. Hydraulic features were confirmed through field inspection. Based on the\n\nanalysis of GIS data and aerial images, the surface was classified as either buildings (roof),\n\nfootpaths paved, roadway, parking lots and permeable areas.\n\nSubcatchmentOrtophotos\n\nFlow monitoring\ndata\n\nAttributes\n\n\u2022 Area\n\u2022 Width\n\u2022 Slope\n\u2022 Im perv\n\u2022 N Im perv\n\u2022 N Perv\n\nInfiltration: Green\nAm pt\n\n\u2022 Suction Head\n\u2022 Conductivity\n\u2022 Initial Deficit\n\nSubcatchment/ LID\npractice\n\n\u2022 COD\n\u2022 Phosphate\n\u2022 Nitrite\n\u2022 Nitrate\n\u2022 Fe\n\u2022 Zn\n\u2022 Pb\n\u2022 Ni\n\u2022 Cd\n\nAttributes\n\nWeather\nobservations\n\nDEM\n\nRunoff quality\ndata\n\nQ uantitative parametrization\nQ ualitative\n\nparametrization\n\nSurf ace layer\n\n\u2022 Berm  Height (or\nStorage Depth)\n\n\u2022 Vegetation\nVolum e Fraction\n\n\u2022 Surface Slope\n\u2022 Swale Side Slope\n\nSoil Layer\n\n\u2022 Thickness\n\u2022 Porosity\n\u2022 Field Capacity\n\u2022 Wilting Point\n\u2022 Conductivity\n\u2022 Conductivity\n\nSlope\n\u2022 Suction Head\n\nStorage Layer\n\n\u2022 Thickness\n\u2022 Void Ratio\n\u2022 Seepage Rate\n\u2022 Clogging Factor\n\nWater balance\nMass balance\n\nCalibration\n\nCoefficients C1 and\nC2 -Washoff\n\nCoefficients C1 and\nC2 - Buildup\n\nLong-term simulations\n\nScenarios\n2015/2025/2050/2100\n\nLID practice\n\n\n\n88\n\nEach of these areas was then analyzed for their hydraulic and hydrological\n\nparameters. After manipulating the storage behavior, according to the rules defined by the\n\ntheories used in the model elaboration (James, 1985), the tool gives temporary results to be\n\nreintroduced into the SWMM for hydraulic analysis. The areas were delineated into two\n\nsubcatchments, i.e., the bioretention area and its contributing drainage area, which was\n\ndetermined to be 75% impervious by analysis of GIS data.\n\nSWMM version 5.1.010 includes an LID computational model which simulates the\n\nhydrological response of each practice as part of its respective subcatchment. SWMM allows\n\nrunoff to be routed from impervious to pervious areas, and takes the additional infiltration\n\ninto account. Within the bioretention submodel, a report provides key characteristics such as\n\nwater level, soil moisture, evaporation, infiltration, soil percolation, runoff and continuity\n\nerror of the bioretention system. The model scheme can be observed in Figure 5.3.\n\nFigure 5.3 - Model building scheme based on real scenario data.\n\n5.2.4 Model calibration and validation\n\nModel calibration provides means of verifying the model with respect to observed\n\nphysical scenarios. Monitoring the discharge into and out of the bioretention and the water\n\nquality for selective rain events was performed.  Calibration was done using a sensitivity\n\nanalysis by the Sensitivity-based Radio Tuning Calibration (SRTC) tool in PCSWMM\n\nversion 6.3 (CHI, 2007).\n\nWater quantity calibration was performed using monitored events from August to\n\nSeptember, 2015. The parameters used for calibration were the contributing area, hydraulic\n\nwidth, average slope and the imperviousness. These parameters were chosen based on the\n\n\n\n89\n\nsensitivity analysis known in literature (e.g. Dudula, J., &amp; Randhir, T., 2016). The SRTC\n\nallows the user to define the uncertainty associated with the parameters and to execute the\n\nmodel multiple times within the uncertainty limits. Once completed, adjustments were made\n\nto individual parameters manually without the pre-defined uncertainty intervals, using the\n\nobserved data and the model response. The model performance was evaluated by the Nash-\n\nSutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the correlation coefficient (R\u00b2).\n\nInfiltration was compared to soil moisture sensor data, installed in the bioretention\n\ncell. The Green-Ampt method was used to calculate infiltration within each time step. Soil\n\nlaboratory analysis indicated the local soils were a medium to fine sand to dark brown silt.\n\nParameters for this type of soil were taken from Rawls, W.J. et al., (1983), and can observed\n\nthe contribution area characteristics observed in Table 5.2 . These parameters values were\n\nused for the calibration of the drainage area and for the bioretention system subcatchments,\n\nfor more details can be found in appendix c.

The accumulated pollutants wash\n\noff load varies according to the deposition rates, the duration of prior drought period and the\n\neffects of redistribution over the drought of the previous period. However, due to different\n\nresults coming out of different investigation studies, researchers began to question the\n\nrelationship between pollutant accumulation versus deposition speed over the prior drought\n\nperiod (Chiew et al, 1999). The influence of many other factors, such as land use, traffic\n\n\n\n91\n\nvolume and weather, play different roles over the accumulation of different pollutants\n\n(Egodawatta and Goonetilleke, 2006).\n\n5.2.5 Future scenarios\n\nScenarios were created for the model runs, as the years 2015, 2025, 2050, and 2100,\n\nconsidering the possible evolution of the population and land use within the area and the need\n\nto augment the bioretention dimensions. The dimensions of the bioretention system and the\n\npercentage of impermeable areas of each scenario are shown in Table 5.5.\n\nThese values were obtained using the sizing method and simulation developed by\n\nRosa et al. (submitted) and presented in Rosa et al. (2015) and Rosa et al. (2016). In this\n\nmethodology, the following parameters have to be considered for the calculation:\n\nhydrological risk, rainfall intensity, contributing drainage area, soil properties, precipitation,\n\nrunoff coefficient, drained peak flow, stored volume, bioretention geometry, mass reduction,\n\ninflows, spillway and infiltration outflows, pollution load, reductions in inflows and\n\ndischarges and PULS routing method. To facilitate design of a bioretention cell, a\n\ncomputational model was developed to simulate and optimize its design, using unique\n\nparameters to each cell given its specific location. A key feature of the method is that it\n\nestimates the eventual size of the bioretention cell for multiple, cumulative scenarios. This\n\nallows the designer to select a variety of trial sizes and iteratively simulate each bioretention\n\ncell by steps, by setting the desired time intervals and the input parameters.\n\nYear Width (m) Length (m) Area (m2) Occupation (%)\n2015 5,6 10,9 63 25\n2025 5,6 13 72,8 50\n2050 5,6 21 117,6 75\n2100 5,6 25 140 85\n\nTable 5.5 - Dimensions of bioretention techniques for future scenarios.\n\nFor the qualitative simulation, the pollutants concentration in rainwater should be\n\ninserted, which was obtained from Galavoti (2010) shown in Table 5.6.\n\nParameters Concentration (mg/l)\nBOD 15,00\n\nPhosphate 0,07\nNitrite 0,09\nNitrate 0,01\n\nFe 0,11\nZn 0,33\nPb 0,05\nNi 0,02\nCd 0,02\n\nTable 5.6 - Rain concentration Galavoti according to method (2010)\n\n\n\n92\n\n5.3 Results and discussion\n\n5.3.1 PCSWMM Calibration and validation\n\nThe three rainfall events quantity calibration, by the SRTC tool, is provided in Figure\n\n5.4. The three events were calibrated simultaneously, achieving a NSE of 0,64 and R\u00b2 of 0,66\n\nfor the entrance, and a NSE of 0,79 and a R\u00b2 of 0,83 for the exit. In general, NSE and R\u00b2\n\nhigher than 0,5 are considered satisfactory for model calibration (Moriasi et al., 2007). Based\n\nupon these results, the calibration in PCSWMM, with the SRTC has shown to be reasonably\n\ncapable of predicting runoff within this study.\n\nFigure 5.4 - Results for calibration based on rain-flow profile in bioretention technique of entry for each rainfall\nevent\n\n5.3.2 Future scenarios Simulation\n\nThis research considers the simulation of future scenarios for the expansion of land\n\nuse and occupation to evaluate the integrated efficiency of the bioretention technique, for\n\nquality and quantity control of the urban runoff. In the following items, we present the results\n\ngenerated by PCSWMM\u2019s simulations.\n\nOut\n\nOut\n\nEvent 1\n\nEvent 2\n\n\n\n93\n\n5.3.3 Quantitative efficiency\n\nTable 5.7 provides inlet, outlet and the infiltrated runoff volumes for the years of\n\n2015, 2025, 2050 and 2100. The simulation results indicated that the predicted runoff\n\nreduction will reduce from present day to 2025. However, it will increase in the following\n\nsimulated years. Considering this, the planned adaptations in the bioretention, for the changes\n\nin the contribution area, may be beneficial.\n\nVolume in Millions of liters\n2015 2025 2050 2100\n\nInlet 8,8 17,4 25,9 29,5\nOutlet 0,8 3,2 4,1 4,2\nStored volume 8 14,2 21,9 25,1\nEfficiency % 90,7 81,4 84,3 85,9\n\nTable 5.7 - Input volumes, output, and infiltration to the simulated scenarios\n\nThe design and simulate a bioretention cell is proposed by Rosa et al. (submitted).\n\nThus, it was developed a computational model in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), the\n\nmodel called BIRENICE (BIoREteNtIon CEll method). A key feature of the method is to\n\nestimate the eventual size of the bioretention cell for multiple, cumulative scenarios. This\n\nenables the designer to select a variety of trial sizes and iteratively simulate each bioretention\n\ncells in steps, by setting the desired time intervals and the input parameters.\n\nThis proposed modular sizing aimed to keep the quantity efficiency constant through\n\nthe increase of the impervious area, due the occupation over the years. However, the SWMM\n\nmodel differs from the BERENICE, which can alter the storage rate from the designed and the\n\ndifference in efficiency over the simulated years. In addition, the sizing for the proposed\n\nefficiency was done for a rainfall intensity of 77,9 mm/h (a 20 min rainfall for 5 return years)\n\nand the simulation covers different precipitations and, consequentially, different income\n\ndischarges. The 2015 scenario presents the highest quantity efficiency of 90,7% and the 2025,\n\nthe lowest with 81,4%. The efficiency is improved from 2025 to 2050 with 84,3% and\n\ncontinues to raise to 2100, reaching 85,9%.\n\nThe accumulated volume at the entrance and at the exit of the bioretention system\n\nwas analyzed for each scenario. From January to April of the each scenario-year, totalizing 15\n\nmonths, the historic precipitation from January 2015 to April 2016 was used (Figure 5.5).\n\n\n\n94\n\nFigure 5.5 - Accumulated volume for each scenario\n\nThe accumulated volume curve behavior (Figure 5.5) reacts as expected in the dry\n\nand rainy period, with a more accentuated accumulation in the rainy months. However, for the\n\noutlet, the accumulation tends to be more uniform during the year, which suggests that\n\nbioretention provides some resilience in operating under the both weather conditions (dry or\n\nrainy).\n\n5.3.4 Qualitative efficiency\n\nThe pollutant removal efficiency is directly related to the percentage of the volume\n\nof the water infiltration and exhibits similar behaviour with all constituents. It should be\n\nemphasized that the analysis was made for the total amount of precipitated rain during the\n\nday, not considering the rain duration, which can explain some differences in efficiency for\n\nnear precipitated volumes values.\n\nFor a better comprehension of the bioretention removal capacity, the average\n\nremoval efficiency of all pollutants was grouped into precipitation intervals in Figure 5.6,\n\nconsidering the same number of days in each group. The days, with precipitations lower than\n\n10mm, were not considered in Figure 5.6, since it is almost 100%.\n\nComparing the scenario of 2025 to 2100, the nearer and farther future scenarios, it is\n\npossible to verify that the removal efficiency for smaller amounts of precipitation is greater\n\n\n\n95\n\nfor future scenarios, thanks to a greater holding capacity resulting from the increase of the\n\ntotal area of the technique. However, these scenarios efficiency tends to be lower with higher\n\nprecipitation volumes due to the fact that with a larger percentage of impervious area, higher\n\ninput flow rates compromise the ability to store larger percentages of input volume.\n\nFigure 5.6 - Average removal efficiency by depth\n\nIt is possible to notice that the average bioretention removal efficiency for all\n\nscenarios keep constant. With Minitab 17 software support was performed variance analysis,\n\nthe results are shown in Table 5.8. Using a significance (?) of 0,05 the p-value, that indicates\n\nthe probability of falsely reject the null hypothesis when it is true, can be lower than or equal\n\nto significance level (?). The result obtained was p=0,106, providing evidences to conclude\n\nthat scenarios average efficiencies analyzed are equal.\n\nSource GL SQ (AJ.) QM (Aj.)

The method expresses that averages that does not shares the same letter are\n\nsignificantly different.

For the following year, the efficiency, in general, raised compared to 2025\n\nbetween 84,3% to 87,5% in 2050 and 85,8 to 88,3% in 2100. The highest removal efficiency,\n\nin all scenarios, was for iron, contradicting the efficiency, measured in the field, in which iron\n\npresented the lowest efficiency of all parameters. That supported that the wash off quality\n\ncalibration for this parameter was failed. The parameters with the lowest removal efficiency,\n\nhowever, varies according to the scenarios.\n\n2015 2025 2050 2100\n\nInlet Outlet Inlet Outlet Inlet Outlet Inlet Outlet\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nEffi.\n(%)\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nEffi.\n(%)\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nEffi.\n(%)\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nMass\n(kg)\n\nEffi.\n(%)\n\nCd 0,18 0,02 91,01 0,35 0,07 81,43 0,52 0,08 84,42 0,59 0,08 85,86\n\nCOD 134,21 12,35 90,80 263,03 48,54 81,54 390,38 60,94 84,39 441,00 62,53 85,82\n\nFe 1,71 0,09 94,69 2,64 0,36 86,53 3,57 0,45 87,46 3,93 0,46 88,33\n\nNi 0,62 0,06 90,66 1,22 0,23 81,44 1,82 0,28 84,37 2,05 0,29 85,78\n\nNitrate 0,86 0,07 91,43 1,64 0,29 82,20 2,40 0,37 84,74 2,70 0,38 86,12\n\nNitrite 0,01 0,00 90,00 0,02 0,00 83,33 0,03 0,00 85,19 0,03 0,00 86,67\n\nPb 0,44 0,04 90,77 0,87 0,16 81,44 1,30 0,20 84,36 1,47 0,21 85,82\n\nPhosphate 0,63 0,06 90,72 1,23 0,23 81,48 1,82 0,28 84,40 2,06 0,29 85,80\n\nZn 2,93 0,27 90,70 5,76 1,07 81,46 8,56 1,34 84,34 9,68 1,38 85,78\n\nTable 5.10 - Removal efficiency in future scenarios\n\nIn order to compare the overall quality efficiencies between the scenarios, the average\n\nfor all simulated scenarios was done, shown in Figure 5.7.\n\nIt can be noticed that, from 2015 to 2025, the proposed modulation is not sufficient\n\nto keep the same efficiency. The reason is the sudden growth of the impervious area, from\n\n25% to 50%, and, consequently, the increase of water volume into the bioretention. In the\n\nother scenarios, it can be noticed that the proposed modulation to the CT area increment will\n\nbe enough to improve the efficiency in the following scenario. Another factor that may\n\n\n\n97\n\ninterfere with the desired efficiency is that the proposed modulation is not a linear growth that\n\naccompanies the growth of the urban area.\n\nFigure 5.7 - Average Efficiency for scenarios\n\nComparing the quality efficiency with the quantity, in Table 5.7, it is noticeable these\n\nvalues proximity: 90,9 and 91,2% in 2015, 81,8 and 82,3% in 2025, 84,6 and 84,9% for 2050;\n\n85,1 and 89,2% in 2100, for quantity and quality efficiencies respectively. This comparison\n\nshows the importance of water retention for the pollutant removal rate and how the quality\n\nefficiency depends on quantity efficiency.\n\nA research indicates a relationship between the contribution area and the area of\n\nbioretention system: WSUD Manual (MELBOURNEWATER, 2003) presented efficiency\n\nfractions of pollutant removal for bioretention system with 2% of the catchment area reaching\n\nup to 99 % efficiency. The system presented here has a unique design methodology, not\n\nfollowing the mentioned relationship, with approximately 0,3% of the drainage area.\n\nHowever, it has different construction characteristics, as being deeper than the commonly\n\nused with pre-treatment for solids removal and having an expansion of the modular system,\n\nallowing the achievement of the presented efficiency.\n\n5.4 Conclusions\n\nThis study showed that implementing LID practices such as bioretention can mitigate\n\nthe impacts of urban development, in terms of both runoff and pollution excess. Thereby, the\n\nrisk of flooding in urban watersheds is reduced.\n\nSimulations were conducted in PCSWMM in order to evaluate the expected LID\n\npractice performance over the incoming years. The quality calibration model was satisfactory,\n\n\n\n98\n\nindicated by high NSE and R\u00b2 values, for both the subcatchment and the LID practice. The\n\nquality calibration, however, was poor, due to the data limitation.\n\nSimulated pollutant removal efficiency for all scenarios was high, reaching values\n\nbetween 80% to 90%, with the 2015 scenario receiving the highest efficiencies. The positive\n\nimpact of increasing the size of the bioretention (on removal efficiency) appears to offset the\n\nnegative impact of increasing urban development. Thus, the model has been demonstrated as\n\nan effective designing tool for evaluating the effects of LID implementation. The steps\n\ndescribed in this study can be customized and applied to similar LID practices in various\n\nclimate regimes to more generally evaluate the effectiveness of LID.\n\nThe modular sizing, as the simulation has shown, is effective in maintaining the\n\nquality efficiency until 2100. However, the LID practice area, proposed for 2025, should be\n\nreviewed by other methods, in order to improve the LID practice efficiency for the\n\ncorresponding year and land use characteristics and to prevent higher pollutants load to go to\n\nthe receiving water body.\n\nGiven the difficulty to determine the adjustment coefficients for the wash off and\n\nbuild up steps, this article wanted to elucidate these steps in order to contribute to the protocol\n\nof low-impact techniques modeling for urban drainage.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support of projects: (1) MAPLU2 - Stormwater Management in\nUrban Environment/FINEP, (2) Thematic Project 2008/15161-1 FAPESP \u201cAssessment of\nImpacts and Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil and Strategies for Adaptation Options\u201d\n(3) Casadinho/PROCAD CNPq 552494/2011-9 (UFAL-EESC / USP) \u201cAdvanced monitoring\nof biotechnological processes and environmental quality\u201d and (4) CNPq 307637/2012-3 of\nScientific Productivity.

GENERAL CONCLUSION\n\nThe conclusion will be presented in the form of answers to the proposed objectives\n\nand, subsequently, a section of recommendations for future works.\n\nThe research objective is to study the generalized efficiency of combined detention\n\nand bioretention compensatory techniques to control diffuse pollution, with the introduction\n\nof new experiments coupled to long-term adaptation strategies for qualitative and\n\nquantitative urban drainage aspects based on ecohydrology.\n\nOn the one hand, this thesis suggests that compensatory techniques can be used not\n\nonly for evaluation of the impacts of diffuse pollution from urban drainage, but also as a way\n\nof contributing to the sustainability of watersheds, favouring the maintenance of the\n\nhydrological cycle, and, consequently, of the cycling of water bodies. On the other hand, the\n\nthesis also presents theoretical, practical and model examples of how compensatory\n\ntechniques can also be approached as in-site, local long-term adaptation and mitigation\n\nstrategies for qualitative and quantitative risks linked to urban drainage. Thus, CTs, as\n\nengineered devices under the concept of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems would hit\n\nmulti-purpose targets reaching out a great variety of stakeholders.\n\nOne specific objective is \u201cTo discuss the scope and limitations of sizing\n\nmethodologies and criteria and evaluate the efficiency of compensatory measures in the\n\ncontrol of urban drainage quantity and quality\u201d. Across the Thesis is clearly depicted how\n\nscopes and limits of the up-to-date sizing methodologies and criteria introduce a great range\n\nof outputs. Contrasting methods of addressing CT\u2019s efficiency changes alter projects, budgets\n\nand people\u2019s experience. Thus, different CT\u2019s sizing criteria perform a real gap of knowledge\n\nthat: (1) directly impacts on the physical and cost of the nature of CTs, and (2) inherently\n\nexerts and prioritizes bias on forthcoming plans of operation and maintenance during the CT\u2019s\n\nlifetime to maintain a minimum, but theoretical, efficiency.\n\nThe quali-quantitative efficiency of methods proposed in specialized literature were\n\ncompared with the model performance proposed in this Thesis, making this as innovative\n\nresearch by presenting the modular sizing system and the future scenarios simulation to\n\nimprove the use of compensatory techniques on drainage management in urban scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the Thesis assumes that this gap of knowledge must be analyzed with a\n\ndeeper discussion on the worldwide state-of-the-art nomenclature of terms, approaches,\n\ntechniques and research groups on SUDS. Then, the Thesis\u2019 second chapter presents the\n\ntechnique of bibliometrics, an innovative and multidisciplinary tool in the area of engineering,\n\n\n\n107\n\nfor the survey of bibliographic data, construction of databases and guidance for research of\n\nbioretention and CTs. Cognitive and relative maps of authors and techniques also show that\n\nstill: (1) neither complete standards, nor norms are completely gathered among worldwide\n\nresearch groups, which have interesting high auto-citation or indexing, and (2) local scales,\n\ncontexts and knowledge are crucial factors affecting a priori the assumptions for whichever\n\nsizing of CT`s and even global vision of SUDS.\n\nThe set of 22 themes presented in this research and related to SUD, involved\n\nresearchers from 82 countries, 2,027 research centers and 8,237 authors interacting through\n\n11,857 citation relationships. In this domain, 72% of the relationships occurred between\n\nauthors from European and North American countries. The topics most widely used in the\n\nacademic community are Stormwater management, Low impact development, integrated\n\nUrban water management, Bioretention and best management practice.\n\nThe second specific objective of this thesis is to evaluate the applicability of\n\necohydrological indicators in the generalized evaluation of the efficiency of compensation\n\nmechanisms for the quantity and quality of water.\n\nThrough the fourth chapter and, based on the legal framework and ecohydrological\n\nindicators using geoprocessing tools, it was possible to evaluate proper areas to implement the\n\nbioretention techniques, evaluating the impacts of urban growth through maps of land use and\n\noccupation. It also helped to choose the area for the constructions of the bioretention system.\n\nAfter the construction of the system, it is proven by the results of quali-quantitative limits that\n\nthe system can corroborate (help) with the sustainability of Mineirinho\u2019s river basin.  Besides\n\nthat, the construction of compensatory techniques to treat diffuse pollution provided with\n\ndrainage systems which are planned considering ecohydrology indicators, is also revealed as a\n\npromising mechanism for maintaining urban watersheds.\n\nAs the third specific objective, which is to study experimentally, in the micro\n\ndrainage pilot devices, the detention effects combined with bioretention, including design,\n\nsizing, installation, monitoring, modeling and efficiency analysis during the lifetime of the\n\ndevices.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges faced when coming to CT\u2019s is the integration between\n\nrunoff quantitative, qualitative performance and sizing methodology. This Thesis presents on\n\nits third chapter a sizing methodology for bioretention systems, called BIRENICE and its\n\nperformance compared with HEC -HMS model.\n\nIt is proved, by the results found in the comparison between the sizing method of\n\nbioretention proposed systems, BIRENICE and HEC-HMS that the proposed method is\n\n\n\n108\n\nefficient, based on the presented results of the quali-quantitative parameters. It is innovative,\n\nbecause it is planned and executed considering the modulation by predicting the growth and\n\ndevelopment of the areas in question and, through the simulation of dimensioning, the\n\nextension of the proposed systems, making it applicable to the conditions of urban drainage,\n\nwhich can be adapted to other realities.\n\nThe last specific objective is simulating long-term adaptation scenarios to compare\n\nthe effects of combined detention and bioretention devices of macro-drainage on the selected\n\ncritical watersheds.\n\nIn this step of the research (the fifth chapter), the focus is to evaluate the\n\nperformance of a bioretention system and to simulate long-term scenarios using a PCSWMM\n\nmodel. The simulation model PCSWMM has a quick and concise manner of using its\n\ninterface, allowing the user to have instant access to calibration components of the SWMM 5,\n\nproviding an effective calibration for the aspects used in the preparation of future scenarios.\n\nThrough the fifth chapter, it is possible to conclude, that the employment of PCSWMM tool\n\nfor simulation of future scenarios is efficient for any proposed adjustments in CT, considering\n\nthe changes in land use and occupation for future scenarios. The PCSWMM stands out as an\n\nimportant model for simulation and a tool for managing water resources for decision\n\nmaking. Comparing the results of quality and quantity efficiency, it can be noticed that even\n\nthough there is an efficiency variation between scenarios, it remained satisfactory, between\n\n81,8% and 91,2% in the simulated scenarios.\n\nBy the experience obtained with this research together with the experimental results\n\nfound by monitoring of compensatory techniques, it was possible to evaluate the control of\n\ndiffuse pollution parameters in micro drainage and its computational modelling of quali-\n\nquantitative aspects, which were considered in this study. However, it is noted that there are\n\nstill some gaps while inserting these types of technologies: (I) methods for generalized\n\ndimensioning; (II) lack of experimental data; (III) needs maintenance and enhancement of\n\nmeteorological monitoring network; (IV) bureaucratic matters, involving the construction of\n\nthe experiment in the Brazilian territory.\n\nThrough experience, it is possible to conclude that compensatory techniques of\n\nbioretention are promising alternatives to corroborate witch the water resources management,\n\nmainly in relation to the quantitative and qualitative aspects of water from the diffuse\n\npollution of urban drainage caused by floods in urban centers.\n\n\n\n109\n\nRecommendations for Future Researches\n\nThrough the experience obtained during this thesis, it was possible to make some\n\nrecommendations for future work:\n\n?
