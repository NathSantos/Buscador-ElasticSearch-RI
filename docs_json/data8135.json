Moreover, \n\nbased on the experience shared by several RES Cooperatives, including the closer look at the \n\nselected four case studies (The Co-operative Energy in the United Kingdom, Ecopower in \n\nBelgium, EWS in Germany and Som Energia in Spain), this work came up with a set of \n\nrecommendations for any RES Cooperative that intends to become a new electricity supplier in \n\nits national territory. For instance, the study allows to identify the main reasons why RES \n\nCooperatives are becoming a solid alternative solution to the traditional energy companies, the \n\nmain barriers a RES Cooperative faces during its electricity retailing supply process, as well as \n\na role of solution that may help to overcome these possible obstacles. \n\nBased on these findings, and with the aim to transform Coop\u00e9rnico in the first green electricity \n\nsupplier in Portugal, the work also extends to the full characterisation of the Portuguese \n\nelectricity sector, including the compilation of all the steps and requirements to become a new \n\nelectricity supplier in Portugal.  \n\nAlthough the Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s electricity retailing supply process has already been initiated with \n\nthe assignment of registration of electricity supplier by The Directorate General for Energy and \n\nGeology (DGEG), the final step will only be given after the Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s General Assembly in \n\nmid-December 2014. Then, it will be discussed and assessed the different options available and \n\nvoted the path to take for the missing process.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Deregulation, Liberalisation, EU Policy, EU internal energy market, \n\nRESCoop, Community Cooperatives, Citizen participation, Social Enterprise, Renewable \n\nEnergy Sources, Green Revolution, Sustainable development, National Electricity System, \n\nElectricity Supplier, Coop\u00e9rnico, Competition \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResumo \n\n \n\nEm colabora\u00e7\u00e3o com a Coop\u00e9rnico, a primeira cooperativa de energias renov\u00e1veis em Portugal, \n\neste trabalho prop\u00f5e-se a estudar o papel que as cooperativas de energias renov\u00e1veis podem vir \n\na ter no futuro do mercado liberalizado, na Europa e em Portugal. Para al\u00e9m disso, com base na \n\nan\u00e1lise da experi\u00eancia partilhada por v\u00e1rios cooperativas europeias de energias renov\u00e1veis, \n\nincluindo os quatro casos de estudo seleccionados para este trabalho (The Co-operative Energy \n\nno Reino Unido a Ecopower na B\u00e9lgica, a EWS na Alemanha e a Som Energia na Espanha), \n\neste trabalho pretende tamb\u00e9m reunir um conjunto de recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es para uma cooperativa de \n\nenergias renov\u00e1veis poder entrar com sucesso no mercado liberalizado de electricidade. Entre os \n\nv\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros analisados, o estudo permite identificar as principais raz\u00f5es pelas quais as \n\ncooperativas de energias renov\u00e1veis est\u00e3o cada vez mais a tornar-se numa alternativa concreta \n\n\u00e0s tradicionais empresas de energia, as principais barreiras que as cooperativas de energias \n\nrenov\u00e1veis enfrentam no decorrer do seu processo de comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o de electricidade, bem \n\ncomo um leque de poss\u00edveis solu\u00e7\u00f5es que as podem ajudar a superar estes obst\u00e1culos. \n\nCom base nestes resultados, e com o objectivo de transformar a Coop\u00e9rnico no primeiro \n\ncomercializador de electricidade verde em Portugal, o trabalho prop\u00f5e-se igualmente a \n\ncaracterizar o panorama do sector el\u00e9ctrico portugu\u00eas, incluindo a compila\u00e7\u00e3o de todos os \n\npassos e requisitos que uma cooperativa de energias renov\u00e1veis necessita cumprir para se tornar \n\nnum comercializador de electricidade em Portugal. \n\nEmbora o processo de comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o de eletricidade da Coop\u00e9rnico j\u00e1 tenha sido iniciado, \n\ncom a atribui\u00e7\u00e3o do registo de comercializador de electricidade pela Direc\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral de Energia \n\ne Geologia (DGEG), o passo final s\u00f3 ser\u00e1 dado ap\u00f3s Assembleia Geral da Coop\u00e9rnico que \n\nocorrer\u00e1 em meados de Dezembro de 2014 onde ser\u00e3o avaliadas as diferentes op\u00e7\u00f5es poss\u00edveis e \n\nvotado o caminho a seguir para o que resta do processo. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Desregulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o, Liberaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, Pol\u00edticas Comunit\u00e1rias, Mercado \n\nInterno Europeu de Energia, RESCoop, Cooperativas Comunit\u00e1rias, Cidadania, \n\nEmpresas Sociais, Energias Renov\u00e1veis, Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o Verde, Desenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel, \n\nSistema El\u00e9ctrico Nacional, Comercializador de Electricidade, Coop\u00e9rnico,Competi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n v                                                                                                                                   Nelson Andr\u00e9 \nGalv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias \n\n \n\nIndex \n\n1.

Thus, by way of tribute to all those who helped me out achieve this goal, I \n\nwould like to dedicate this page.  \n\n  \n\nI would first like to acknowledge the support of my family, since the moment I was born they \n\nwere always there for me. Without them, none of this would be possible. \n\n \n\nRight after, it is time to acknowledge also the support of my friends. From the special support I \n\nget constantly over 1000 km away, in Girona, to the daily support of the good old friends I \n\nthank you all guys. By the way, it has been really nice to notice your growing interest for the \n\ncooperative movement, particularly Coop\u00e9rnico, as well as the importance to contribute to a \n\nnew energetic paradigm.    \n\n \n\nFocusing now in the work itself, I would like acknowledge my supervisors for guiding me in \n\nthis project. Besides their contribution throughout the work, I would like also to highlight the \n\nenthusiam we\u2019ve shared for the purpose behind the work. We truly believe that it will serve the \n\ncommunity. Furthermore, I would like to thank the people of the Coop\u00e9rnico and Boa Energia \n\nfor all the support, and having the best working environment that I have ever experienced.   \n\n \n\nMoreover, I would like to thank to all the RES Cooperatives. Firstly, for their daily and \n\nmeaningful effort to promote the long term sustainable development and the energy transition, \n\nand secondly for the willingness to help me and share their knowledge and experience with me.  \n\n  \n\nAt a time of global recession, my expectations for the future are the best. Yes, I do know there \n\nwill be very ups and downs in my life. However, with respect to the professional career i believe \n\nI\u2019ve got all the tools to be well succeed. For this I thank FCUL, for the time spent there, \n\nprofessors and classmates for the all I\u2019ve learned.  \n\n \n\nFinally, I would like to thank you dear reader. I hope that in the end of your reading you may \n\nshare the feeling that together we can contribute to a world where clean, renewable energy is the \n\nestablished method for powering energy efficient, environmentally friendly, healthy to resilent \n\ncommunities.

Introduction \n\nSince 1996, several legislative measures have been adopted by the EU members, addressing \n\nmarket access, transparency and regulation, consumer protection, supporting interconnection \n\ncapacity between countries, and security of supply, with the aim to liberalise and create \n\ncommon rules for the achievement of an European Internal Energy Market (IEM). As a \n\nconsequence of such measures, gradually the barriers and trading obstacles are being eliminated, \n\nallowing the entry of new electricity suppliers in the markets of EU members and, consequently, \n\nthe possibility to industrial and domestic consumers freely choose the offer that better fits their \n\nconsumption patterns.    \n\nBesides the natural harmonisation of the European energy sector, the environmental issues and \n\nthe social economy are also other main concerns in Europe for this century that has already \n\nstarted. Thereby, and intending to speed up the process of energy transition and covering the \n\napparent failure in the approximation of tax policies, as well as the reduction of costs and \n\nenergy pricing charged to European end-users, it has risen in some European countries the \n\nemergence of a new generation of social organisations with new business models based on \n\nrenewable energy sources (RES) and the promotion of a sustainable development. \n\nRegardin the Portugal\u2019s case, the social discontent by the current European energy paradigm is \n\nalso noticeable, which in late 2013 led to the creation of Coop\u00e9rnico, the first RES Cooperative \n\nin the country.  \n\n \n\nDriven to understand the potential role that RES Cooperatives may have in the future of the \n\nliberalised energy sector not only across Europe, but particularly in Portugal, and be a \n\nsuccessful guide for any RES Cooperative that aims to get in the national electricity retail \n\nmarket, besides the current chapter, this work is divided into five main chapters: \n\n \n\nAs baseline for the work, chapter 2 characterised the three European directives wishing to \n\nharmonise and liberalise the European IEM. Nevertheless, the chapter starts with a brief \n\nhistorical description about the energy market deregulation worldwide, focusing then in the pre \n\nand post European electricity market deregulation. \n\n \n\nChapter 3 is dedicated to the evolution of the cooperative movement, particularly of the energy \n\nCooperatives. Thus, in here it is studied the potential role that RES Cooperatives may have in \n\nthe future of the European energy sector, including the reasons behind the revival of the energy \n\ncooperatives as well as the main challenges these social enterprises face in the current energy \n\nmodel. Finally, it is analysed the need of a new EU energy legislation that protects and \n\npromotes the growth of RES Cooperatives in the future of EU energy transition.  \n\n \n\nIn chapter 4, it is characterised four different European electricity markets. For each market it \n\nwas chosen a social enterprise that demonstrates that this cooperative phenomenon has been a \n\nsuccess. The selected examples were: The Co-operative Energy in the United Kingdom, \n\nEcopower in Belgium, EWS in Germany  and Som Energia in Spain.  \n\nWith the help of these four case studies, and the experience of many other RES Cooperatives \n\nsuch as Enerplus, NLD Energie, DE Unie, Enercoop, Zencer, Nosa Enerx\u00eda, Greanpeace Energy \n\nand GoiEner it is possible to identify a set of references and best practices that may help, with \n\nsuccess, any national RES Cooperative entering in the energy market. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n17 \n\n \n\nChapter 5 focus on the evolution of the portuguese electricity system. Besides the overall review \n\nregarding the legislative framework behind the liberalisation of the portuguese electricity \n\nmarket, in this part of the work it is also done a full characterisation of the national electricity \n\nmarket, including the current energy companies operating on it. \n\nMoreover, using the Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s process as reference, the chapter compile all the steps and \n\nnecessary requirements for a RES Cooperative that aims to become a new electricity supplier in \n\nPortugal.  \n\n \n\nFinally, chapter 6 provides the concluding remarks of the all the previous chapters, including \n\nthe reasons for failure to create an unified, competitive European energy market. Nevertheless, \n\nthis long and evolutionary process of market liberalisation has brought a new interest in the \n\ncooperative model. Thus, besides presenting a review behind the emergence of RES \n\nCooperatives, this chapter also indentifies the reasons why these social enterprises are becoming \n\na solid alternative solution to the traditional energy companies. \n\n \n\n2. Energy Market Deregulation \n\n2.1. Towards World Energy Market Deregulation \n\nSince the birth of the European Community, energy has always been considered a key point of \n\nthe political agenda of the region and, consequently, has seen heavy government intervention, \n\nboth through public ownership and regulatory reforms. On the bases of this intervention are \n\nessential the nature of power supply in the economy and the natural monopoly features of the \n\nenergy sector.  \n\n \n\nIn the past three decades, emerging and developed countries have been through privatisation, \n\nrestructuring and deregulation programs in sectors that historically were regulated monopolies \n\nand/or state-owned, such as airline transportation, telecommunications, railway, package \n\ndelivery services, among others. Energy is no exception and, over the same period, this sector \n\nhas been going through a time of change worldwide with the implementations of progressive \n\nreforms. The motivation for the energy market deregulation were driven mostly by economic \n\nreasons, political ideology on the faith of market forces, distaste for strong unions, the desire to \n\nattach foreign investment and, since the nineties,  environmental concerns [1]. \n\n \n\nJust focusing on energy sector, the first step towards electricity deregulation was made in the \n\nUSA in the late seventies, and just then diffused to the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, \n\nto the European continent. But what triggered that move?  \n\nThe most important of the factors was financial. The oil embargo of the mid-seventies led to \n\nserious downturns in many countries economies, which by the early eighties were burdened by \n\nforeign debt, budget shortfalls and inflation. Macroeconomic and fiscal depression forced \n\ngovernments to implement economy-wide structural adjustment programs, with the goal of \n\nreducing public spending and increasing private capital flows into the economy [2]. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n18 \n\n \n\nHistorically, the cost of power production declined as utilities1 built ever-larger power plants. \n\nWith the population growth the electricity demand increased requiring more and larger plants, \n\nwhich reduced even further the costs as well as increasing the utility rate base. Consumers had \n\nabundant low-cost electricity; regulators oversaw declining rates, increased electrification and \n\neconomic growth. Meanwhile the utilities and stockholders saw their money grow. Thus, we \n\ncan say this era was a win-win situation for everyone. \n\nThe problem came when the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) cut \n\noff the oil supply to the world. Rapid increases in the cost of fuel to operate power plants were \n\nequally translated in the retail power prices. The United States of America (USA) made efforts \n\nto decouple the electricity system from the world petroleum market through the construction of \n\nnuclear and coal-fired plants, which are more expensive than simple oil or natural gas-fired \n\nplants. Consequently, the fixed costs of utility operations increased, further increasing retail \n\nelectricity prices and naturally it led to consumer complaints and the need of new regulatory \n\nreforms [2]. \n\n \n\nBy that time, USA were the largest energy market in the world so, as expected, the first move \n\ntowards electricity deregulation was made by the Americans, with the introduction of the Public \n\nUtility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) in 1978. Briefly, this legislation stated a new class of \n\nnon-utility generators who could build small power plants and co-generation facilities, known as \n\nqualifying facilities and the entrance of new market players called Independent Power \n\nProducers. Under PURPA, public utilities were required to buy energy from those power \n\nproducers at a price equal to the \u201cavoided cost\u201d of the utility. The main goal of this law was to \n\nprovide increased conservation of electricity, increased efficiency in the use of public power \n\nplants and ressources by electric utilities and equitable retail for electric consumers [2][4]. With \n\nPURPA, the private producer concept has born and a window opportunity for the global energy \n\nmarket was open.   \n\n \n\nThe economic consequences of those measures were felt extremely quickly and in the early \n\neighties the worldwide discussion on energy markets reform has started. Several emerging and \n\ndeveloped countries have commenced reform initiates including liberalisation, privatisation, and \n\nrestructuring of the energy supply and distribution industry. In the front row was Chile, setting \n\nup a wholesale market pool in which power plants would sell their power to retailers, and \n\nintroducing a law in 1982 allowing industrial consumers to choose their retailer and negotiate \n\ntheir prices freely [5].  \n\n \n\nSome years later, the European market reform started with the British experience. The success \n\nand innovation of the new British market inspired the European Union (EU) energy strategy and \n\nbecame the main driver for further developments. \n\n \n\nBy 1990, United Kingdom (UK) began the restructuring process with the opening of their \n\nwholesale market to the competition, by unbundling transmission from generation and splitting \n\ngeneration into several companies. Retail market were opened up in stages, immediately \n\nbeginning with the largest industrial and commercial users and concluding with the opening of \n\nits residential market in early 1999. We can say the greatest achievement of the British \n\n                                                      \n1\n Despite the different definitions and concept about public utility, when we compare the USA and \n\nEuropean countries, typically a utility provides a commodity or service that is considered essential to the \n\nordinary people such water, natural gas or, in this case power. Because utility service is a vital need, it has \n\nbeen considered to be in the public interest to regulate its provision [3].  \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n19 \n\n \n\nderegulation was their utilities allowing direct access by letting any type of users choose a \n\npower supplier competitively and pay the utility only for distribution service. Under \n\nrestructuring, utilities may provide combined billing for both the distribution service and for the \n\npower [6]. The pioneering nature of the changes in the UK, along with the perceived success of \n\nthe reforms meant that the \u201cBritish model\u201d was often used as an archetype for redesigns of other \n\nmarkets, including the modern restructuring of the USA electricity system in 1992 with the first \n\nEnergy Policy Act, which allowed non-utility generators and marketers to compete in the same \n\nnascent wholesale markets as traditional vertically-integrated utilities [7]. \n\n \n\nAlong with the UK deregulation, something was happening in the Northern Europe, more \n\nprecisely in Norway, with the established of a non-full privatisation electricity market in 1991. \n\nThe main difference between both markets is that UK deregulation was based on integral \n\nprivatisation while the Norway reform not, meaning that despite the common wholesale market, \n\nthe retail markets have remained national. Later this energy market was extended to incorporate \n\nSweden, Denmark and Finland forming the world\u2019s first multi-national electricity market, called \n\nNord Pool. [8] \n\n \n\nWith energy reforms and, consequently, competition spreading through some European \n\ncountries, the EU decided to adopt a pro-competitive framework that would turn the several EU \n\nmember-states' energy markets into a unique single European market, that will be explored in \n\nthe following section. Aiming to achieve a free and open energy sector, since the mid-nineties \n\nthe EU has been continuing releasing some legislative package with common energy directives \n\nfor the EU members. However, and in accordance with the White Paper\n2\n and the Green \n\nPapers\n3\n, the approach of the EU in terms of restructuring energy markets has a broader \n\nperspective, which includes besides a developing a more competitive Internal Energy Market \n\n(IEM), security of supply and sustainability [1].  \n\n  \n\nIn conclusion, the eighties and nineties were marked by the formulation and launching of \n\nseveral deregulation trends that paved the way for electric utility deregulation as we know \n\ntoday. Now that we have an overview about the history of the world energy market \n\nderegulation, let\u2019s focus on the electricity market deregulation in EU. \n\n \n\n2.2. Electricity Market Deregulation in European Union \n\nRealising that liberalisation and competition would result in internal and external efficiency, \n\nbased on the UK and other European countries\u2019 experiences, and that the benefits would be \n\npassed on to users and the economy in the form of lower prices and better allocation of costs, \n\nthe European Commission (EC) set up efforts to bring to life the idea of a single energy \n\nEuropean market. Moreover, the EC published in 1988 its first concrete proposal on that way, \n\n                                                      \n2 According to the glossary of EU legislation, Commission White Papers are documents containing \n\nproposals for Community action in a specific area. In some cases they follow a Green Paper published to \n\nlaunch a consultation process at European level. When a White Paper is favourably received by the \n\nCouncil, it can lead to an action programme for the Union in the area concerned. In this particular case, \n\nthe specified White Paper is about \u201cCompletion of the Internal Market\u201d (1985) [10]. \n\n3 The same glossary states Green Papers are documents published by the EC to stimulate discussion on \n\ngiven topics at European level. They invite the relevant parties to participate in a consultation process and \n\ndebate on the basis of the proposals they put forward. Green Papers may give rise to legislative \n\ndevelopments that are then outlined in White Papers. Again, in this particular case, the speficied Green \n\nPapers are \u201cThe Protection of Utility Models in the Single Market\u201d  and \u201cInnovation\u201d (1995) [10].  \n\nhttp://europa.eu/documents/comm/green_papers/pdf/utility_model_gp_COM_95_370.pdf\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n20 \n\n \n\nwith the working document entitled \u201cThe Internal Energy Market\u201d.  According to this \n\ndocument, the EC was committed to create an EU-wide integrated energy market by removal of \n\nall existing and potential technical and fiscal barriers that difficult the trade of energy products \n\nwithin the Community [9].  \n\n \n\nThe document made references to some points towards a common energy policy (Figure 1), \n\nincluding the removal of differences between countries, open competition between suppliers at a \n\nEuropean level, price regulation, environment protection or the connection of EU members' \n\nenergy transportation grids so the European energy system can \u201cwork\u201d as a whole [9]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Ideas behind the creation of the internal energy market \n\n \n\nTo achieve this such desired IEM, it was set four actions [9]: \n\n \n\n? Carrying out of the provisions concerning the energy sector in the 1985 White Book;  \n? The determined application by the EC of the provisions of Community Law;   \n? The attainment of a satisfactory equilibrium energy/environment;  \n? Definition of appropriate means, to be selected case by case, in areas specifically related \n\nto energy policy. \n\n \n\nIn the light of the first point, the 1985 White Book aims are the removal of technical barriers \n\n(whether they concern the harmonisation of rules and technical norms between EU members or \n\nthe opening up of public procurement) and the removal of fiscal barriers (notably by the \n\napproximation of indirect taxation).  \n\nTo keep and reinforce the internal market, in particular to ensure freedom of movement, the EC \n\nsuggest a strong competition policy. Therefore, guided by the same outlines in the White Book \n\non the internal market the EC defined four sets of instruments, including those which ensure the \n\nfree circulation of goods and services, those in respect of state monopolies of a commercial \n\ncharacter, the rules of competition and the state aids.  \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n21 \n\n \n\nIn relation to the environment protection, it was submitted some proposals to reduce emission \n\nstandards for all type of combustion plants. Also, the EC believes that an unified energy market \n\nis just possible with an harmonisation of safety standards and their applications, though those \n\napplications could bring effects to the cost of producing and using energy.   \n\nFinally, according to this document, two areas emerge as priorities: energy prices and \n\ninfrastructures.  \n\nThe development of energy trade depends on energy prices, costs and tariffs, which vary \n\nbetween Member-States (MS). In order to bring transparency to market, the EC intend to submit \n\na detailed comparative analysis of energy prices plus conclusions and proposals regarding \n\ntransparency of prices, in particular for large industrial users, an examination of the price \n\nstructure in the MS, including the conditions, costs and pricing principles applied to transfers of \n\nenergy, and in conjunction with the parties concerned, an examination of the cost structures in \n\nthe various energy sectors and assess these cost structures.  \n\nThe existence of adequate infrastructure is a cornerstone for the transfer of energy and hence a \n\nprerequisite with a view to securing flexibility, greater security of supply, and in the final \n\nanalysis a more integrated Community energy market. Despite the considerable networks for \n\nelectricity, natural gas, crude oil and petroleum products, the EC intend to go further in this area \n\nwith the prospect of the IEM, but always in mind that infrastructure operations must satisfy the \n\nminimum economic and commercial viability criteria and these operations, in which costs are \n\nimportants, should be major factors presupposes that must be encouraged.  \n\n \n\nIntroduced the working document, it is time to understand what is on the roots of the European \n\nelectricity market deregulation.  If the text above is dissected quickly came across the idea that \n\nthere were three considerations behind the paper (Figure 2): \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. The main reasons behind the 1985 White Book \n\n \n\nElectricity market opening was originally aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of European \n\nindustry against external industries, particularly Japan and the USA. Inspired by the \n\nliberalisation experiments all over the world, which are very different in terms of the design and \n\norganisation of the electricity market, the EC aimed with this document to develop its own \n\nmodel to improve efficiency, to create a more competitive energy-producing industry, to ensure \n\nsecurity of supply and to attract new investors. \n\n \n\nRelated with the political motives are the economic reasons, in the way European firms are \n\ncompeting against other manufacturers or service-providers which operate on the basis of \n\ndifferent economic factors and inputs. Hopefully, with the free access to energy sources under \n\ncompetitive market prices should contribute to the reduction of costs for firms. This reduction \n\ncan thus lead to greater competitiveness of European firms on the international asset markets, as \n\nlong as other countries don\u2019t succeed in reducing their energy costs by even bigger margins. \n\n \n\nFinally, there is a reason, of legal nature, which supports the establishment of the IEM once the \n\nlegal instruments available to the EC are no different from those which allow the realisation of \n\nEurope without frontiers.  \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n22 \n\n \n\nBy the Article 8a of the EEC Treaty (Single European Act) the single market is defined as: \n\n \n\n\u201c\u2026an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services \n\nand capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty \u201c \n\n \n\nArticle 8a EEC Treaty   \n\n \n\nThat means, the free flow of merchandise, the free offering of services and the right to set up \n\nanywhere in the EU are applicable to energy products and services related with them. \n\n \n\nDespite the significant efforts made by the EC to promote these guidelines, the truth is that it \n\nwas required an adequate legislative framework that gradually incorporated elements of \n\nliberalisation and energy activities within the EU members, which came in 1992, with the \n\ncelebration of the Maastricht Treaty (formally, the Treaty on European Union).  \n\nFrom that moment on, the progress of constructing competitive Europe-wide electricity market \n\naccelerated very rapidly and after four years of negotiations on energy policy guidelines, the \n\ndecisive breakthrough was achieved with the adoption in 1996 of the Directive 96/92/EC, \n\nconcerning common rules for the internal market in electricity.  \n\n \n\nNevertheless, and despite this important mark towards European energy market deregulation, \n\nthe final objective was, and still it\u2019s today, far from being complete, due to the significant \n\ndifferences between EU members regarding the energy market development. \n\n \n\nThe next section explores the obstacles that slowed down the progress of the IEM, particularly \n\nthe establishment of public utilities and natural monopolies within each national energy system, \n\nwhich naturally limit competition and create cautious markets. \n\n \n\n2.3. European Electricity Market \n\nIn order to better understand the deregulation process it is necessary to analyse how the \n\nEuropean energy market operates before and after deregulation. \n\nOn the contrary of the other commodities, the energy market has quite unique characteristics \n\n(Figure 3). Electricity represents a product that cannot be differentiated in terms of quality or \n\nfeatures, it cannot be stored and its cost is heterogeneous depending mostly on the way it is \n\nproduced. Also, the demand of electricity is highly inelastic and as it has no substitutes, the \n\nsupplier must be sure he can deliver as much electricity as it is required at any given moment. \n\nFinally, the transmission and distribution of electricity depend on the distance, but also on the \n\nresistance in the networks. That means, in the case of congested network infrastructures, it is \n\npossible that inefficient generators located in a particular location could provide cheaper \n\nelectricity than efficient generators in other place.  \n\nDue to all these factors, the energy sector has been organised as a state-owned monopoly in \n\nmost European countries and the liberalisation process can often be quite complex [11]. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Characteristics of the electricity \n\n \n\nThe fact that the electricity sector is considered extremely important for the economic \n\ndevelopment for all other sectors justified  as well the intervention of the government, through \n\ndirect and indirect State subsidies to maintain a stable industry.  \n\n \n\nSince the adoption in 1996 of the First Directive, and despite the countless directives with \n\nspecific deadlines for the full European market liberalisation, the context is far from the once \n\ndesired integral energy market open to competition. In spite the previously mentioned security \n\nof supply and the complexity of this commodity, there were also other reasons for failure to \n\ncreate an unified, competitive energy market [12]:  \n\n  \n\n? Deliberate government interference motivated by a desire to support the main players in \neach electricity market; \n\n? Lack of interest by dominant players or governments to build additional transmission \nlines to facilitate cross-border trade; \n\n? Weak enforcement of EU directives at country level. \n\n \n\nLooking back, it is safe to say, the European energy market liberalisation has reached different \n\nlevels as each EU members approached the process in their own way [11]. While a number of \n\ncountries followed the path of liberalisation in order to maintain the community proserity, \n\nevolution, international competitiveness and economic growth, others have done so only on \n\npaper and preferred to maintain the government monopoly [13]. \n\n  \n\nTwenty-five years ago electricity sector was a heavily regulated industry in almost all MS, \n\ndominated by national or regional, vertically integrated monopolies engaged all the four sectors, \n\nas generation, transmission, distribution and supply networks (Figure 4). In other words, they \n\nwere the main actors from generation through distribution and supply to final consumers. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Fully state-owned energy market \n\n \n\nUnderstanding this situation could not carry on, the EC began to challenge the existence of \n\nmonopolies and exclusive rights, on the grounds that they made the existence of an IEM \n\nimpossible. Nevertheless, at the time there was no realistic chance of getting the agreement of \n\nall or probably even a qualified majority of EU members to discuss the liberalisation of the \n\nEuropean energy at the Community level and, for that reason, the EC decided to use the Articles \n\nFor consumers \nelectricity is a \nhomogenous \n\nproduct\n\nCost depends \nmostly on the \n\nway it is produced\n\nNon-storable \ncommodity\n\nDemand of \nelectricity is \n\nhighly inelastic\n\nTransmission and \ndistribution of \n\nelectricity depend \non the distance\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n24 \n\n \n\nof the EEC Treaty relating to competition law and the rules on free movement to force MS to \n\nabandon these monopolies. \n\nAs mentioned above, there were no special provisions on energy policy. Despite various EEC \n\nTreaties, for instance those relating to approximation of laws, the common commercial policy, \n\nconsumer protection, economic and social cohesion, environment, taxation, and, once again, \n\ncompetition, free movement and the internal market, none were applicable to the energy sector \n\nor provided scope for Community instruments capable of triggering significant effects on its \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nHowever, by the Article 90, the EEC Treaty stated that [14]: \n\n \n\n\u201cundertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having \n\nthe character of a revenue-producing monopoly shall be subject to the rules contained in this \n\nTreaty, in particular to the rules on competition,  insofar as the application  of such rules does \n\nnot obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the  particular tasks assigned to them. The \n\ndevelopment of trade must  not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the \n\ninterests of the Community.\u201d \n\n \n\nEEC Treaty, Article 90, Part Three, Title VI, Chapter 1, Section 1 \n\n \n\nAnd supported by the ex Article 82 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) \n\n[15]:  \n\n \n\n\u201cAny abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the common market or \n\nin a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market  insofar as \n\nit may affect trade between Member States.\u201d \n\n \n\nSuch abuse may, in particular, consist in: \n\n \n\n(a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading \n\nconditions; \n\n(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers; \n\n(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent with other trading parties, thereby placing them \n\nat a competitive disadvantage; \n\n(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of  \n\nsupplementary which, by their nature or according to commercial usage,  have no connection \n\nwith the subject of such contracts.\u201d \n\n \n\nTEC, Article 82, Part three, Title VII,  Chapter 1, Section 1 \n\n \n\nThe EC argued that monopoly rights disrespected the EEC Treaty requirements on the free \n\nmovement of goods and establishment. Moreover, the EC further alleged that monopolies were \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n25 \n\n \n\nnot even necessary to achieve essential public service objectives and because of that, slowly, EU \n\nmembers vertically owned companies\u2019 rights have been successfully challenged. \n\n \n\nThereby, forced by the EC, most EU members started the deregulation of the electricity market \n\nby adapting the European directives to their own legislation. It must be pointed out that in some \n\ncountries liberalisation of the sector began before the release of the First Directive framework \n\nand later modified certain aspects of their own laws in order to accommodate certain European \n\nrules.  \n\nJust focusing on the opening up of the market, each EU country is a special case in itself, even \n\nthough they are all rapidly moving towards total opening.   \n\n \n\nThe best European example is the UK market, followed close by the Noord Pool (Scandinavia \n\nmarket). Actually, these markets were the firsts to be fully functional and liberalised as already \n\nremarked.  \n\nRegarding to the most competitive market in the EU, the level of consumer participation in the \n\nUK energy supply markets is among the highest of any market in the entire world, where almost \n\nall users (96%) know that they can change energy suppliers and most (70%) feel confident that \n\nthey know how to do this. \n\nAlthough also liberalised, the Noord Pool however is not fully privatised. In fact, public \n\nownerships is still dominating the region. A few major power producers have a dominating \n\nposition in their national markets but none has a big share (more than 20%) of the Noord Pool. \n\nBasically, it shows that the degree of integration increases the level of competition among the \n\nmarket players and it is reflected on the high level of consumer participation [1]. \n\n \n\nBesides these markets, there is another important market in Europe, the Continental European \n\nmarket. Within this market there are several regional groups, which differ in their features. \n\nAmong the EU members that are part of this huge market, the first to be fully liberalised was \n\nGermany. Germany started the liberalisation process around 1998 with the First Directive of EC \n\n- promotion of diversification of energy supply, reduction of energy costs and improvement of \n\nenergy efficiency and development of renewable energy sources (RES). As part of the Central \n\nEuropean model of organisation, in Germany there was never a national electric monopoly \n\nestablished under the government. However, though a big number of energy suppliers were \n\nactive on the German electricity market before the deregulation started, the market was not \n\nhighly competitive [13].  \n\nThere are also two particular markets that are worth mention: the Italian market and the French \n\nmarket.  \n\nIn the beginning, France has preferred to follow the minimum steps required by the EU in terms \n\nof deregulation. Thus, the deregulation process started only in 1999 but the level of state \n\nprotection was still very high, postponing all the process evolution. However, the status of the \n\nmain supplier EDF, which had a market share of 98%, started being challenged around 2004, \n\nand the French\u2019s electricity market was slowly open to liberalisation [13]. \n\nThe Italian case is quite similar to the French as there is also a main supplier, ENEL, that has \n\nbeen ruling the market for a long time, despite the several difference showed by the Italian \n\nelectricity market since the adoption of the First Directive framework, in 1999. For instance, the \n\ncreation of a public company, Gestore della Rete di Transmissione Nazionale, responsible for \n\noperating and crrying out the required maintenance and development of the national network \n\n[4].  \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n26 \n\n \n\nKeeping in the same region, Austria\u2019s electricity market was partly opened to liberalisation in \n\n1999, then the whole market was liberalised in the beginning of the century and a voluntary \n\nenergy spot  market of Austria \u2013 EXAA \u2013 was established [1]. \n\nThe Benelux countries, Netherlands and Belgium, transposed the First Directive to their laws in \n\n1998 and 1999, respectively, and at the moment both have an almost 100% fully deregulated \n\nelecricity system.  \n\nRegarding the Iberian countries, Portugal and Spain, together they set up the common Iberian \n\nelectricity market, MIBEL, in order to open up their market to competition. In the context of the \n\nmarkets liberalisation processes, where the activities of the network operators are considered \n\nnatural monopolies and are therefore subjected to economic regulation, the production and \n\nselling of electricity are open to competition [16].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. EU\u2019s electricity market deregulation by 2007 [17] \n\n \n\nWith the adoption of the Second Directive, all EU members opened up their electricity markets \n\nto competition. By 1st of July 2007, the deadline stated by the document to implement this \n\naction, only 13 countries had opened their markets to competition.  \n\nThus, even though most of European consumers are now free to choose their electricity \n\nsupplier, this does not mean that energy markets have been fully deregulated. In fact, only ten \n\ncountries had completed total deregulation by 2007 (Figure 5). But what is preventing the total \n\nderegulation across Europe? \n\n \n\nBasically, there are several types of price controls in place in some national electricity markets \n\nwhich hinder pricing and competition. Moreover, certain countries are striving to control their \n\ndomestic energy assets and support their so called national champions [18].  \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n27 \n\n \n\nThe latest Directive (Directive 2009/72/EC) can be the response to these issues. In order to \n\nEurope finally reach the desired common energy market, the document proposes energy \n\ncompanies engaged in both electricity generation and transmission must either sell off their \n\nentire transmission business, or they may retain ownership rights but will be forced to outsource \n\ntransmission activities to Independent System Operators. The directive also proposes the \n\nestablishment of a joint European energy regulator and that network oversight rules be made \n\nmore uniform.  \n\n  \n\nSummarising the European market structure, the completion of the IEM by 2014, the latest \n\npublished deadline, is far from being achieved. Although national market structures have \n\nchanged in the last decades, only a few countries have a fully deregulated electricity market, \n\nmaking the European electricity market quite heterogeneous. \n\nFrom one side, UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Germany had fully (or very close \n\nto fully) deregulated electricity market, whilst on the other side there are countries, like France, \n\nItaly, Portugal, with national monopolies and public ownerships. In between there is a range of \n\nmixed cases, including most of the countries that follow the Central European model \n\norganisational market. That means, a mix between public and private capital. \n\n \n\n2.4. The Internal Electricity Market Directives \n\nLooking back to European IEM legislation it is possible to identify a pattern of successive \n\nwaves regarding to liberalisation legislation. A new reform package has been introduced every \n\nsix years, after the EC has come to the conclusion that the existing regulatory framework does \n\nnot go far enough towards the IEM. But why is that? \n\n \n\nThe repeated amendments to the legislation is caused by the continuing failure, reflect of \n\ndifferences in EU members\u2019 approaches to the implementation of the directives, and of the \n\nfailure to prevent the established monopolies with regard to market entry, market exit and \n\npricing. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Evolution of the European Internal Electricity Market Directives \n\n  \n\nSo far, the EU has adopted three different legislation packages (Figure 6), including \n\naccompanying regulation. The First Directive, adopted in 1996 concerning common rules for \n\nthe establishment of an European IEM was followed by a further electricity directive. The \n\nSecond Directive, adopted in 2003, was a more complex framework having as ultimate goal to \n\nset up the legal frame for full market liberalisation. Plus, attached to the directive there was a \n\nregulation named 1228/2003/EC, focused on issues such as the network access for cross-border \n\nenergy trading. The Third Directive, adopted in 2009, was the last framework released. This \n\ndocument, also known as the Third Package, amended the existing legislation and supported the \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n28 \n\n \n\nfurther opening of the energy markets and established an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy \n\nRegulators (ACER) by way of a regulation (Regulation(EC) 713/2009).      \n\n \n\n2.4.1. The First Directive \n\nThe Directive 96/92/EC is known for being the kick starter of the liberalisation in the European \n\nelectricity sector. This set of legislation introduced, for the first time, common rules for the \n\norganisation of the sector, and established progressive market opening with the submission of  \n\npioneering measures in all areas of activity (generation, transmission, distribution and supply) \n\n[19].  \n\n \n\nBasically the First Directive\u2019s most important issue was the split between competitive sectors, \n\nas generation and retail supply, from the natural monopoly activities of transmission and \n\ndistribution networks (non-competitive sectors) (Figure 7 and 8).  \n\n \n\nFrom: \n\n \n\nFigure 7. The European Electricity System pre liberalisation \n\n \n\nTo: \n\n \n\nFigure 8. The European Electricity System post the First Directive \n\n  \n\nAs European electricity vertically integrated firms commonly owned all the four areas of \n\nactivity, the EC introduced some measures to prevent the risk that these companies would use \n\ntheir ownership of the network to unfairly give advantage to their generation and/or retail \n\nsupply business, including:  \n\n \n\n? Introduction of independent entities group, transmission and distribution system \noperators (TSO and DSO, respectively), which would determine and control the access \n\nto the networks. Moreover, the firms which owned the transmission and/or distribution \n\nsystems would be responsible for operating, ensuring the maintenance of the network in \n\na non-discriminatory way, and, if necessary, work as a public utility (Article 7 to 12); \n\n? Vertical unbundling: Obligation for vertically integrated firms to keep, in their internal \naccounting and management systems, the activities of generation, transmission, \n\ndistribution and retail supply as separated and independent sectors (Articles 13 and 14).   \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n29 \n\n \n\nWith regard to transmission and distribution networks, and to enable generators and suppliers to \n\nget their power to final consumers there were measures to ensure all competitors would be able \n\nto get non-discriminatory access to the network. Thus, the First Directive introduced the concept \n\nof Third-Party Access (TPA), in which each EU member can choose the access to the network \n\nsystem among three options (Articles 17 to 19): \n\n \n\n? Negotiated TPA: Generators and suppliers had to negotiate with the TSO and DSO for \nthe access to the networks; \n\n? Regulated TPA: Basically, the access to the network has fixed tariffs. The tariffs are \npublished by the relevant authorities, and applied to all users of the network; \n\n? Single buyer: It is defined as the legal entity that gathers all the responsibility regarding \nto the network, including the single administration and running of transmission and \n\ndistribution networks and/or for the centralised purchase and sale of electricity. \n\n \n\nMoreover, the access to the network systems can only be refused when there is not enough \n\ncapacity to transport the electricity or when transport would make it impossible to carry out \n\npublic services obligations. \n\n \n\nConcerning generation, the document, from Article 4 to 6, stated that EU members must follow \n\nbetween two procedures regarding the construction of new power plants: \n\n \n\n? Authorisation: With this procedure, anyone can build a power plant whenever and \nwherever they wanted, provided it complied with planning law and its features, \n\ninclunding the safety and security of the electricity system, protection of the \n\nenvironment, energy efficiency, among others;  \n\n? Tendering: The electricity system would continue to be centrally planned. Therefore, \nan official body would set the amount of capacity that need to be built and replaced in \n\nthe country, and the specifications tenders bidders would need to meet.  \n\n \n\nRegarding to the supply activity, there was changes too. Thus, the First Directive, through \n\nArticle 19, required the EU members to gradually open up their electricity markets. Thus, it was \n\nintroduced, firstly, competition in the wholesale markets (the large consumers), through three \n\nstages: \n\n \n\n? By February 1999, about 26% (40 GWh/year) of the market had to be open; \n? By February 2000, about 28% (20 GWh/year) of the market had to be open; \n? By February 2003, about 1/3 (9 GWG) of the market had to be open.  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. Main features of the First Directive \n\n \n\nFinally, concerning regulation, the document did not provided any appointment regarding, for \n\ninstance, an independent authority, which should be responsible to resolve disputes between \n\ncompanies in each sector, nor the verification of the tariffs established by the TSO and DSO. \n\nMoreover, the document notwithstanding the reduction of monopoly to the network operation, \n\ndid not provided also any jurisdiction over ownership rights. \n\n \n\nAlthough the document established basic rules (Figure 9), which the EU members have to \n\nincorporate in their legislation,  \n\n \n\n\u201cMember States shall ensure (\u2026) that (\u2026) electricity undertakings are operated in accordance \n\nwith the principles of this Directive, with a view to achieving a competitive market in \n\nelectricity, and shall not discriminate between these undertakings as regards either rights or \n\nobligations.\u201c \n\n \n\nArticle 3, Chapter II  \n\n \n\nSupply\n\n(Open up the market in three phases)\n\nBy February 1999 (26% of the \nmarket)\n\nBy February 2000 (28% of the \nmarket)\n\nBy February 2003 (33% of the \nmarket)\n\nTransmission and Distribution Networks \n\n(Introduction of independent entities group, transmission and distribution system operators \n(TSO and DSO, respectively)\n\nRegulated TPA Negotiated TPA Single Buyer\n\nGeneration\n\nAuthorisation Tendering\n\nVertical Unbundling \n\n(Separation between competitive sectors and non-competitive sectors)\n\nObligation for vertically integrated firms to keep, in their internal accounting and management \nsystems, the four activities separated and independent sectors \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n31 \n\n \n\nit also gave a certain degree of freedom for EU members to apply the guidelines since the \n\ndifferent choices led to equivalent economic results, as well as similar level of opening and \n\naccess to the electricity markets. The First Directive does not impose a single rigid new market \n\nstructure but sets out the minimum conditions under which sector can be developed.   \n\nThereby, as a result, instead of having an harmonised IEM, as desired by the EEC Treaty, the \n\nEU members pursued different liberalisation and regulatory strategies, leading then to the \n\ndevelopment of many individual liberalised markets.   \n\n \n\nMoreover, as expected, over time it became obvious that the introduction of competition and its \n\nmeasures (general obligation not to discriminate, to preserve the confidentiality of commercially \n\nsensitive information, to negotiate in good faith, among others) was not enough to address the \n\nlack of regulation.   \n\nAdding to the technical and regulatory issues arising from the idea of cross-border trade in an \n\nEuropean IEM, that simply was not approached, the need for a new framework was evident \n\n(Figure 10), and in 2003 came out the first amendment to the document. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10. Main issues deriving from the First Directive \n\n \n\n2.4.2. The Second Directive \n\nDue to the circumstances previously stated, the EC was forced to bring forward new legislative \n\nmeasures aiming not only to accelerate the market opening, evening then the liberalisation \n\namong the EU members, but it also reply to the criticisms on network access and regulation, and \n\ntook away the less liberal options presented in the First Directive.   \n\n  \n\nThereby, the new framework ( Directive 2003/54/EC) established more common rules for the \n\nfour areas of activity (Figure 12), and included some extra contents such as safeguard measures \n\nor provisions on regulation [20].  \n\n \n\nBasically, all of the measures stated in this document were intended to provide a framework for \n\ncross-border trading. In fact, international energy trade assumed a much more important role in \n\nthe Second Directive and promoting construction of interconnectors between national systems \n\nseemed to become an end in itself, rather than a means, for instance, to enhance security or to \n\npromote competition (Article 23). \n\nThe high levels of market power of the former vertically \nintegrated companies were far from decreasing\n\nUse of discriminatory methods to manage access to networks \nand especially interconnectors\n\nUneven implementation of the framework among the EU \nmembers\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nAt the end, with the adoption of this new framework, it was expected the European electricity \n\nsystem evolved to (Figure 11): \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 11. The European Electricity System post the Second Directive \n\n     \n\nThus, and starting by generation activity, under the new Directive, the authorisation procedure \n\nwas defined as the standard procedure for new generating capacity (Article 6), even though \n\ntendering procedure is allowed for certain special cases, like environmental interests, promotion \n\nof infant new technologies or when it will be necessary to ensure the security of supply (Article \n\n7). \n\nEssentially, EU members were required to publish a list of criteria, identified in the previous \n\nDirective, for the grant of authorisations for the construction of generating capacity in their \n\nterritory.  \n\n \n\nWith regard to transmission and distribution networks, particularly to TPA, the Article 20 of the \n\nSecond Directive withdrawed the Negotiated TPA and the Single Buyer options, remaining then \n\nthe Regulated TPA as the only option available for the future. In addition, the tariffs or at least \n\nthe methodologies underlying their calculations had to be approved by a regulatory authority.  \n\n \n\nClosely related to the previous point, in the Second Directive the vertical unbundling \n\nrequirements were substantially strengthened. Thus, despite the maintenance of accounting and \n\nmanagement unbundling measures, the new framework, through Articles 10 and 15, stated that \n\nTSO and DSO, when part of a vertically integrated undertaking, must be independent at least in \n\nterms of their legal form, organisation, and decision making from other activities not relating to \n\ntransmission.  \n\n \n\nAccording to the same Articles, the document also said that is not required to separate the \n\nownership of assets of the transmission system from the vertically integrated undertaking. This \n\nmeant that, although an integrated company could still own a TSO or DSO firm as well as, a \n\ngeneration or a retail supply firm, the TSO and the DSO activities had to be carried out by \n\nlegally separate firms.   \n\nAt this point, it is possible to conclude that, like the last document, the Second Directive \n\nremained silent regarding ownership rights. In fact, the EC retains its neutral position. Thus, in \n\nspite of providing for legal unbundling, it does outline that such separation does not imply the \n\ntransferral of assets from the TSO and DSO. \n\n \n\nRegarding to the supply activity, and comparing to the First Directive, which progressively \n\nopened the market on the basis of the consumption of the final costumers, the new Directive, \n\nthrough Article 21, provided a new market opening system: \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n33 \n\n \n\n? Until 1st July 2004, the eligible customers specified in the First Directive; \n? From 1st July 2004, at the latest, all non-household customers should be allowed to \n\nchoose their retail suppliers; \n\n? From 1st July 2007, residential customers should be eligible to access retail supply \ncompetition.  \n\n \n\nOne of the highlights of the Second Directive concerns to regulation. Aware that a framework in \n\nline with cross-border energy trading requires the effective regulation of the transmission and \n\ndistribution networks for reasons such as preventing discrimination, excessive pricing or cross-\n\nsubsidies, the document, through Article 23, stated that EU members shall designate one or \n\nmore competent bodies with the function of regulatory authorities, which will be wholly \n\nindependent from the interests of the electricity industry.  \n\nThese sector regulators were obliged to have a minimum set of standard competences which \n\nincluded, among others: \n\n \n\n? Ensuring non-discrimination, effective competition and the efficient functioning of the \nmarket;  \n\n? Monitoring the rules on the management and allocation of interconnection capacity; \n? Setting of mechanisms to deal with congested capacity; \n? The publication of appropriate information by TSOs and DSOs concerning \n\ninterconnectors, grid usage and capacity allocation to interested parties; \n\n? The effective unbundling of accounts to avoid cross-subsidies between the different \nactivities; \n\n? Monitoring the terms, conditions and tariffs for connecting new producers of electricity \nto guarantee that these are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory; \n\n? Overall compliance of the TSOs and DSOs with the directive. \n\n \n\nMoreover, the document approached the possibility of national regulatory bodies cooperate not \n\nonly with regulatory authorities from other EU country but also with the EC, whether for the \n\ndevelopment of the IEM or to break up dominant companies:  \n\n \n\n\u201c National regulatory authorities shall contribute to the development of the internal market and \n\nof a level playing field by cooperating with each other and with the Commission in a transparent \n\nmanner\u201d \n\n \n\nArticle 23, Chapter VII \n\n \n\n\u201cMember States shall create appropriate and efficient mechanisms for regulation, control and \n\ntransparency so as to avoid any abuse of a dominant position, in particular to the detriment of \n\nconsumers, and any predatory behaviour.\u201d \n\n \n\nArticle 23, Chapter VII \n\n \n\nWith regard to this last quote, the EU members shall provide, by 31st July of each year, the EC \n\nwith a report on market dominance, predatory and anti-competitive behaviour. This report shall, \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n34 \n\n \n\nin addition, review the changing ownership patterns and any practical measures taken at national \n\nlevel to ensure a sufficient variety of market actors or practical measures taken to enhance \n\ninterconnection and competition. \n\n \n\nConcerning to the security of supply, the Second Directive went further, and brought some \n\nsafeguard measures, including the introduction of a security plan in case of a sudden crisis in the \n\nenergy market (Article 24). Besides, the document also made reference to monitoring of security \n\nof supply and the establishment of technical rules: \n\n \n\n\u201cEU members shall ensure the monitoring of security of supply issues covering, in particular, \n\nthe   supply/demand balance on the national market, the level of expected future demand and \n\nenvisaged additional capacity being planned or under construction, and the quality and level of \n\nmaintenance of the networks, as well as measures to cover peak demand and to deal with \n\nshortfalls of one or more suppliers.\u201d \n\n \n\nArticle 4, Chapter II \n\n \n\nThe competent authorities shall publish every two years, by 31st July at the latest, a report \n\noutlining the findings resulting from the monitoring of these issues, as well as any measures \n\ntaken or envisaged to address them and shall forward this report to the EC instantly. \n\n \n\n\u201cMember States shall ensure that technical safety criteria are defined and that technical rules \n\nestablishing the minimum technical design and operational requirements for the connection to \n\nthe system of generating installations, distribution systems, directly connected consumers' \n\nequipment, interconnector circuits and direct lines are developed and made public.\u201d \n\n \n\nArticle 5, Chapter II \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12. Main features of the Second Directive \n\n \n\nAccording to the Article 27, the Directive also required the EC to play an important role towards \n\nthe creation of the IEM. Thus, the EC must address and report to the European Parliament and \n\nCouncil (EPC) outlining the experience gained and progress made in creating the IEM. \n\nBasically, it should cover the existence of non-discriminatory network access, how effective is \n\nthe regulation, the development of interconnection infrastructure and the security of supply \n\nsituation in the EC, market dominance, concentration in the market and predatory or anti-\n\ncompetitive behaviour. \n\n \n\nBesides that, the Second Directive, through the Article 3, established general rules for the \n\norganisation of the sector regarding public service obligations and customer protection ( Figure \n\n13). With the following guidelines, the EC expected to ensure that issues such as social \n\nexclusion, universal service, security of supply and environmental considerations were taken \n\ninto account by private companies operating in a liberalised market:  \n\n \n\nSupply  \n\n(Open up the market in two phases)\n\nAll non-household customers should be allowed \nto choose their retail suppliers from 1st July 2004\n\nFrom 1st July 2007, residential customers should \nbe eligible to access retail supply competition\n\nSecurity of supply\n\nMonitoring of security of supply \nissues\n\nIntroduction of safeguard \nmeasures in case of energy crisis\n\nEstablishment of technical rules\n\nRegulatory authorities\n\nCreation of a sector regulator, which will be wholly independent from the interests of the electricity \nindustry and is responsible to supervise the sector. \n\nTransmission and Distribution Networks \n\nRegulated TPA\n\nGeneration\n\nAuthorisation (standard procedure) Tendering (special cases)\n\nVertical Unbundling \n\n(Maintenance of accounting and management unbundling measures)\nTSOs and DSOs, when part of a vertically integrated undertaking, must be independent at least in terms \nof their legal form, organisation, and decision making from other activities not relating to transmission\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n36 \n\n \n\n? To be in line with EU objectives: EU members must ensure that electricity \nundertakings operate with a view to achieve a competitive, secure, and environmentally \n\nsustainable market in electricity;  \n\n? Public service obligations: EU members may impose public service obligations on \nelectricity undertakings, but such mandate must be clearly defined, transparent, non-\n\ndiscriminatory, verifiable and shall guarantee equality of access for EU electricity \n\ncompanies to national consumers. \n\nIn order to carry on these public service obligations, EU members may introduce the \n\nimplementation of long-term planning, taking into account at all times the possibility of \n\nTPA to the system; \n\n? Universal service: EU members must ensure that all household customers enjoy \nuniversal service. By other words, it is the right to be supplied with electricity of a \n\nspecified quality within their territory at reasonable, easily and clearly comparable, and \n\ntransparent prices.  \n\nTo ensure the provision of universal service, EU members may appoint a supplier of \n\nlast resort; \n\n? State aid: To achieve the goals of social and economic cohesion, as well as those of \nsecurity of supply and environmental protection, economic incentives can be granted by \n\nthe EU members, in a non-discriminatory and transparent way, for the maintenance and \n\nconstruction of the necessary network infrastructure; \n\n? Consumer protection: In order to protect final customers and, in particular to ensure \nthat there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers, the Directive \n\ncontains specific measures aiming to allow such customers with the possibility of \n\nswitching suppliers easily while at the same time being protected from disconnection; \n\n? Potential abuse of public service obligation: EU members may decide not to apply the \nrules on generation or on TPA if the application of those provisions would obstruct the \n\nperformance, in law or in fact, of public service obligations, but only insofar as the \n\ndevelopment of trade is not adversely affected to an extent contrary to the interest of the \n\ncommunity; \n\n? Electricity labelling: EU members shall ensure that electricity suppliers specify in or \nwith the bills, the contribution of each energy source to the overall fuel mix of the \n\nsupplier over the preceding year, and information on the environmental impact, in terms \n\nof at least emissions of CO2;  \n\n? Report the EC: EU members must, upon implementation of this Directive, inform the \nEC of all measures adopted, whether or not such measures require derogation from this \n\nDirective. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13. General rules for the organisation of the sector \n\n \n\nUndoubtedly, the Second Directive was a relevant mark towards the creation of the IEM. \n\nHowever, the document is not perfect and itself presented some major structural problems.  \n\nTo be in line \nwith EU \n\nobjectives\n\nPublic service \nobligations\n\nUniversal service State aid\n\nConsumer \nprotection\n\nPotencial abuse \nof public service \n\nobligation \n\nElectricity \nlabelling\n\nReport the EC\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nFor instance, as stated before, it remained silent regarding the issue of granting monopoly rights. \n\nMoreover, on breaking up the dominant companies and introduce competition in the markets, it \n\nwas still not explicit. \n\nIt is hard to understand how far the Directive required the EC and the national regulatory \n\nauthorities to break up dominant companies and how far it just asked them to take measures that \n\nmitigate the effects of their dominance. \n\nIn order to achieve a fully operational and competitive internal market, there are some main \n\nobstacles, such as issues of access to the network, tarification issues and different degrees of \n\nliberalisation between EU members.  \n\nRegarding the retail market opening, no mention is made on pricing policy. For instance, there \n\nis no requirement that tariffs should reflect costs or that firms should not discriminate between \n\nclasses of consumer (e.g. by offering large consumers disproportionately better terms than small \n\nconsumers).The Directive assumes that the operation of the market will prevent such abuses. \n\n \n\nOther issue, related to the execution of the Second Directive, is the cross-border trading in \n\nelectricity, which in terms of flow exchanges between EU members, remained organisationally \n\nand economically difficult, due to: \n\n \n\n? The differences in the structure of tariffication systems applied in EU members; \n? There was a risk of \u2018pancaking of tariffs\u2019 if all operators of the transit systems charged a \n\ntariff; \n\n? Congestion on some borders often led to allocate the interconnection capacity to market \noperators upon unclear and discriminatory rules. \n\n \n\nThus, to overcome such problems (Figure 14), a harmonised EC framework in tariffs for cross-\n\nborder energy trades and on the allocation of available interconnection capacities was felt \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14.

A new framework: The Third Directive \n\nOnce again, the measures and policies introduced by the EC, through the Second Directive, \n\nwere insufficient to address the full operation and competitive of the IEM. Thus, after intense \n\nnegotiations among EU members and the EC, the latest set of EU laws on energy markets was \n\nadopted in 2009 [22]. \n\n \n\nThe provisions of this new framework (Directive 2009/72/EC), known as the Third Directive or \n\nthe Third Package, marked the latest regulatory stage so far in the EU\u2019s efforts to complete the \n\nIEM, particularly through the set of new measures regarding to security and sustainable of the \n\nEuropean electricity sector, as well as consumers\u2019 right. \n\n \n\nEach Directive had its most significant features, and the Third Directive is no different (Figure \n\n15). In this case, one of the highlights concerns the unbundling of transmission network \n\nsystems.  \n\nAlthough the only option available so far was the legal unbundling, with this new Directive the \n\nEU members could choose between three different models: \n\n \n\n? Full ownership unbundling (FOU): This model consists in the full separation between \nthe operation of electricity transmission networks from generation and supply activities. \n\nUnder this regime, TSO can no longer be affiliated or be part of an company which is \n\nalso active in those activities. \n\nAccording with Article 9, the TSO must has full control of the network. However, in \n\nthis regard, it can also be understood that a person or a company may still be able to \n\nhold shares in both a network and a supply or generation undertaking as long as these \n\nshares represent a non-controlling minority interest.  \n\n? The Independent System Operator (ISO): According with the Article 13, in the ISO \nmodel when the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking, EU \n\nmembers may decide not to choose the first model and designate then an ISO, which \n\nmust be subject to approval by the EC. Once appointed, the ISO has to commit to \n\ncomplying with a ten year network investment plan agreed upon by a regulatory \n\nauthority. \n\nThe ISO has to be an entity full separated from the vertically integrated undertaking, \n\nthat may not hold any interest in a supply or generation company, and must perform all \n\nfunctions of a TSO. \n\n? The Independent Transmission Operator (ITO): This last model is only applicable in \nEU members where TSO belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking. EU members \n\nthat have already introduced the ISO model or full ownership unbundling models will \n\nnot be able to revert to an ITO model. \n\nAccording to Articles 18 and 19, the ITO model preserves integrated supply and \n\ntransmission companies in exchange for obliging such companies to comply with \n\nadditional rules to ensure that the two activities are operated independently, including \n\nfor instance, the managers of TSO cannot have positions of responsibility, interest or \n\nbusiness relationships, directly or indirectly, with the relevant vertically integrated \n\nundertaking or the network development and investment decisions taken by an ITO will \n\nbe examined to ensure that they are consistent with relevant EC-wide plans. \n\nThis model can be considered the lowest threshold for network unbundling.  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n39 \n\n \n\nAt the end, with this Third Directive the EC wanted to make sure that any system model for \n\nunbundling should be effective in removing any conflict of interests between generators, \n\nsuppliers and TSO, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and guarantee the \n\naccess of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should \n\nnot create an overly onerous regulatory regime for national regulatory authorities. \n\n \n\nConcerning generation, no new measures are introduced regarding the introduction of \n\ncompetition in the electricity generation phase. According to Article 7, the only innovations \n\nintroduced concern the utilisation of RES. Thus, the EU members must take into account the \n\ncontribution of the corresponding generating capacity to meeting the overall EC target of at least \n\na 20% share of energy from RES in the EC\u2019s gross final consumption of energy in 2020. \n\n \n\nAs far as distribution activity is concerned, by the Article 25 a EU member may require the \n\nDSO, when dispatching generating installations, to give priority to generating installations using \n\nRES or waste or producing combined heat and power.  \n\nUnlike the transmission network system, the unbundling of the distribution network system \n\nremained without any modification (legal unbundling). However, the persons responsible for the \n\nmanagement of the DSO must not participate in company structures of the integrated electricity \n\nundertaking responsible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the generation, \n\ntransmission or supply of electricity. \n\nMoreover, if the DSO is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, the EU members shall \n\nensure that the activities of the DSO are monitored by regulatory authorities so that it cannot \n\ntake advantage of its vertical integration to distort competition. In particular, vertically \n\nintegrated DSO shall not, in their communication and branding, create confusion in respect of \n\nthe separate identity of the supply branch of the vertically integrated undertaking. \n\n \n\nRegarding the supply activity, there is no further restructuring with exception for Article 33, \n\nwhich referred to the prevention of a disruption in supply. \n\n \n\nKeeping in the track of the Second Directive, the regulation was also subject of attention in this \n\nnew framework. \n\nWhereas the Second Directive acknowledged that the creation of a internal electricity market \n\nrequires the effective regulation of the transmission and distribution networks, it failed to \n\nseparate national regulatory authorities from public entities. Although regulatory authorities \n\nwere required to be complete independent from the interests of the electricity industry, political \n\nindependence was forgotten.  \n\nConcerned about this situation, the Third Directive, through Article 35, required national \n\nregulatory authorities to be legally distinct and functionally independent from any other public \n\nor private entity. Besides that, the EU members shall ensure that its staff  and the persons \n\nresponsible for its management do not seek or take direct instructions from any government or \n\nother public or private entity when carrying out the regulatory tasks. For that purpose, \n\nregulatory authorities shall be granted budgetary autonomy, legal personality and appropriate \n\nhuman and financial resources.  \n\n  \n\nAccording to Article 37, regulatory authorities as regard to market regulation powers and duties, \n\nthey are responsible for monitoring and intervening in the allocation of interconnection \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n40 \n\n \n\ncapacity, setting of mechanisms to deal with congested capacity, ensuring compliance of TSO \n\nand DSO with the rules set forth in the Directive, among others. \n\n \n\nBesides that, and concerning about international energy trading, the framework also provided a \n\nregulatory regime for cross-border issues (Article 38).  \n\nThereby, regulatory authorities shall closely consult and cooperate with each other, to foster the \n\ncreation of operational arrangements in order to enable an optimal management of the network, \n\npromote joint electricity exchanges and the allocation of cross-border capacity. \n\nMoreover they must also coordinate the development of all network codes for the relevant TSOs \n\nand other market actors, and coordinate the development of the rules governing the management \n\nof congestion. \n\n \n\nAt the same the Third Directive was adopted, another document was also accepted by the EU \n\nmembers: Regulation(EC) 713/2009 [23]. The main goal of this document was the \n\nestablishment of ACER.  \n\n \n\nSince the adoption of the First Directive, the lack of coordination at high level has constantly \n\nundermined the establishment of a truly IEM. Aware of this, in an attempt to reinforce the \n\nposition of regulators at the European level, with the Second Directive it was created an \n\nindependent advisory group, called the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas \n\n(ERGEG), to facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation between the regulatory bodies \n\nin EU members and the EC. Despite the good work provided by this entity, the reality showed \n\nthat it was insufficient. \n\n \n\nThus, a new entity with clear competences and with power to adopt individual regulatory \n\ndecisions in a number of cases, including the extinction of barriers to cross-border exchanges of \n\nelectricity with a view to achieving the objectives of EC energy policies, was required and the \n\nresponse came with the entry of ACER. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15. Main features of the Third Directive \n\n \n\nTrying to antecipate the future, the Third Directive also included some innovative measures in \n\nrelation to third countries stated in the Article 11. \n\nFundamentally, the framework requires non-EU companies to be in line with the EU laws in \n\ncase they wish to acquire a significant share of an EU transmission network. In such \n\nacquisitions, national regulatory authorities can refuse the certification of a TSO if the relevant \n\ncompany does not comply with the unbundling requirements of Article 9, its market entry \n\nwould will not put at risk the security of supply of the EU members and the EC.  \n\nThis assessment must be carried out by the very same authority, with the only limitation of \n\nhaving to take into account the international agreements between the EU and the respective third \n\ncountry.  \n\nInnovative measures\n\nIntroduction of third-country clause Record keeping\n\nRegulation\n\nSepartion of national regulatory \nauthorities from public entities\n\nIntroduction of a regulatory \nregime for cross-border issues\n\nCreation of ACER\n\ning generating installations, to give priority to generating installations using RES)\n\nIf the DSO is part of a vertically undertaking, it \nshall be independent in terms of organisation and \n\ndecision-making\n\nThe DSO should be monitored by regulatory \nauthorities\n\nDistribution network \n\n(EU member may require the DSO, when\n\nVertical unbundling of transmission network systems \n\n(EU members can choose between three different models)\n\nFOU ISO ITO\n\nGeneration\n\nEU members must take into account the contribution of the corresponding generating capacity to \nmeeting the overall EC target of at least a 20% share of energy from RES in the EC\u2019s gross final \n\nconsumption of energy in 2020.\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe record keeping was another of the innovations of this Third Directive. Thus, and according \n\nto Article 40, the EU members shall require generator and supply undertakings to keep at the \n\ndisposal of the national authorities, including the national regulatory authority, the national \n\ncompetition authorities and the EC, for the fulfilment of their tasks, all data relating to \n\noperational decisions and trades. The idea behind this Article, is the hope that such requirements \n\nenable regulators to better assess allegations of market abuse and to study past behaviour of \n\nmarket players. \n\n \n\nAs well as the last Directive, the new framework set general rules for the organisation of the \n\nsector with a view to achieve a competitive, secure and environmentally sustainable electricity \n\nmarket (Figure 16). Thus, in order to further consolidate consumer protection, innovation, and \n\nmakes an attempt to merge national systems into one European electricity market, the Article 3 \n\nconsidered: \n\n \n\n? Entrance of foreign electricity suppliers: EU members shall ensure that all customers \nmay have their electricity provided by a supplier regardless of the Member State in \n\nwhich the supplier is registered. In this regard, EU members shall take all measures \n\nnecessary to ensure that administrative procedures do not discriminate the entrance of \n\nforeign electricity suppliers. \n\n? Consumer switching: EU members shall ensure that when a customer wishes to \nchange supplier, the change is effected, in a non-discriminatory manner as regards cost, \n\neffort or time, within three weeks. \n\n? Definition the concept of vulnerable customer: EU members shall take appropriate \nmeasures to protect final customers, and shall, in particular, ensure that there are \n\nadequate safeguards to protect economically vulnerable customers. \n\n? Promotion of sustainable development: EU members shall implement measures to \nachieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion and environmental protection. \n\n? Promoting energy efficiency: EU members shall strongly recommend that electricity \nundertakings optimise the use of electricity, for example by providing energy \n\nmanagement services, developing innovative pricing formulas, or introducing intelligent \n\nmetering systems or smart grids. \n\n? Providing information to customers: EU members shall ensure the provision of single \npoints of contact to provide consumers with all necessary information concerning their \n\nrights, current legislation and the means of dispute settlement available to them in the \n\nevent of a dispute. \n\n? Creation of a consumer body: MS shall ensure that an independent mechanism such \nas an energy ombudsman or a consumer body is in place in order to ensure efficient \n\ntreatment of complaints and out of court dispute settlements. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16. General rules for the organisation of the sector \n\n \n\n \n\nAlthough the Third Directive set the full ownership separation between the TSO and the \n\ngeneration and supply activities for the first time, the framework still allow EU members, \n\nthrough the ITO model, to maintain system arrangements where TSOs belong to a vertically \n\nintegrated undertaking,  so uneven implementation of the Directive is expected. \n\n \n\nNevertheless, reviewing the three European Directives (Figure 17), it is safe to say the \n\nimplementation of the successive frameworks has been almost a success towards the creation of \n\na fully operational and competitive IEM.  \n\nObviously, it is hard to get it right the first time. However, looking back, it is possible to note \n\nthat, for instance, the competitive activities have been opened to all customers before finishing \n\nthe restructuring of the electricity industry. Moreover, the institutionalisation of the cooperation \n\nof national regulatory authorities and the TSOs and DSOs were achieved too in an earlier stage. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

Government policies or incentives often provide support \n\nfor construction of renewable generation facilities [25]. \n\n \n\nOverviewed the energetic situation worldwide, it is time to focus in EU between 1900 and 2011. \n\nThus, starting by the energy production, it is visible the decreases of energy production in \n\nEurope over the years (Figure 20). Total primary energy production in the EU has declined \n\ncontinuously between 2001 and 2011 by 15 % [26].   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20. Evolution of the energy production in EU ( in Mtoe) [24] \n\n \n\nHistorically, the European mix of primary energy production was dominated by fossil solutions, \n\nsuch as coal or natural gas. Not even with the seventies oil crisis the scenario changed, when \n\ngeneration from nuclear power increased rapidly. In fact, the situation remained unchanged until \n\nvery recently with the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in the beginning of the nineties, and the \n\nsubsequent amendments to the treaty (Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon). The objectives were clear, \n\nthe principle of sustainable development supported by the use of RES, while protecting the \n\nenvironment. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\nThus, with these guidelines behind, in 2011 the RES (20.1 %) reached a share similar to coal \n\n(20.7 %), while the natural gas, despite its falls from year to year, accounted a share of 17.4 %. \n\nHowever, the leading place is occupied by nuclear power since the turn of the century, \n\nregistering in 2011 a share of 29 % (Figure 21). \n\nIn the last decade, RES production grew by 63 %, while reductions were recorded in the \n\nproduction of all other fuels [26].   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21.

On the other hand increases were recorded in services (10 %) \n\nand the transport sector (6 %).

The other half was constituted by wind power (26 %), PV power plants (7 \n\n%), biomass and renewable wastes (19 %), and finally, geothermal (1 %).  \n\n \n\nOne of the most famous measures introduced by the EU regarding to environmental protection \n\nand promotion of RES, was the 2020 climate and energy package. Basically, this package is a \n\nset of binding legislation which aims to ensure the EU meets its ambitious climate and energy \n\ntargets for 2020. Shortly, these targets, known as the \"20-20-20\" targets, set three key objectives \n\nfor 2020: \n\n \n\n? A 20% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from 1990 levels; \n? Raising the share of EU energy consumption produced from RES to 20%; \n? A 20% improvement in the EU's energy efficiency. \n\n \n\nFocusing on the first two goals, at the moment the results are promising and let a positive signal \n\nthat these targets will be achieved possibly in a couple of years before the established deadline \n\n(Table 5). For instance, in 2011 EU registered a total share of 13 % in the use of RES [26].  \n\n \n\nTable 5. Share of RES in gross final energy consumption (%) \n\n 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 \n\n2020 \n\ntarget \n\nEU-28 9.2 9.6 10.6 12.1 13.0 20.0 \n\n \n\nMoreover, regarding to GHG, the following table represents the significant reduction over the \n\nyears [24]. \n\n \n\nTable 6. Evolution of the GHG reduction over the years \n\nIndex 100=1990 1990 2000 2005 2008 2009 2010 \n\nEU-27 100 93 91 92 89 83 \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\nAnalysing all the data presented before, it is possible to come up with some conclusions. For \n\ninstance, according to Figure 33, the picture for different electricity generation technologies is \n\none of contrasts: the EU appears to have shifted from the recent trend of \u201cRES plus gas\u201d to \n\n\u201cRES plus coal\u201d. This might be explained by the failure of the CO2 emission market, which was \n\nexpected to \u2018tax\u2019 the use of coal for electricity generation purposes.  \n\n \n\nTable 7. Evolution of the GHGs emissions in Europe \n\nMillion ton CO2 \n\nor equiv. \n1995 2000 2005 2009 2010  \n\nEU-27 5 412 5 330 5 448 4 903 5 006 \n\nIndex 1995 100% 98% 101% 91% 93% \n\n \n\nIn line with this conclusion, and supported by energy and environmental indicators (Table 7), it \n\nis also rational to come up with the fact that although final energy consumption stagnated, the \n\nlow-carbon generation increased, due to the increase in coal-fired generation. The reason? \n\n \n\nIt\u2019s simple, and it is mainly due to the policy choices adopted by major EU economies. \n\nExploring this idea, it is the result of insignificant carbon price signal, cheap coal, expensive gas \n\nand reduced demand, combined with low wholesale prices and subsidised RES that has been \n\npushing gas out of the market [27]. Moreover, the EU comeback for coal can also be seen as a \n\nforced escape of the natural gas coming from Russia, due to the latest events in international \n\nrelations between Ukraine and Russia.  \n\n   \n\nThus, since its qualities as back-up generation are as uncontested, as is its climate advantage \n\ncompared to coal, natural gas-fired power plants play a central role in the future agenda on \n\nstrategic reserve and capacity remuneration mechanisms not only in EU, but worldwide [27].  \n\n \n\nHelping the situation, there is another interesting aspect related to RES. The RES support \n\nschemes, introduced in order to achieve the EU\u2019s 20% RES target, are undercutting the CO2 \n\nprice (Figure 35). Such an effect increases the costs of the transition to low-carbon electricity, \n\nwhile having no impact on the reduction of the emissions. Historic data shows that, increasing \n\nRES generation was closely accompanied by increase in coal-fired generation [27]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 35. Evolution of the carbon prices between 2008 and 2012 [27] \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n56 \n\n \n\nClosely related to the last sentence is the installed capacity, which in the case of RES power \n\nplants has been growing continuously. A common characteristic of added RES capacities \n\nthroughout the whole period is that they are subsidy driven. However, it is important to prevent \n\na possible slowdown of RES growth due to a change in national RES support policies or other \n\nupcoming event [27]. \n\n \n\n3. A call for energy Cooperatives \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nSince ancient times people from different backgrounds join to community solutions, in response \n\nto social and economic disadvantage and in the interest of the weak social layers, particularly \n\nthe working poor. Basically, what unites them is a shared belief that people, not money, should \n\nand have to be the key for transformation and progress. Thereby, it doesn\u2019t take very long to this \n\ncommon expectations and basis for cooperation that goes beyond individual interests, evolve to \n\na cooperative community movement that spreads practically throughout the sectors of our \n\nsociety.   \n\n \n\nThe community Cooperatives that are popping up today across the world are the last stage of an \n\nevolutionary process which has seen the progressive shift of Cooperatives\u2019 aims from specific \n\nsocial and professional groups to society as a whole. \n\nLooking back into the history of the Cooperatives, the early steps of the movement have started \n\nin the 19th century, when the first Cooperatives emerged within the working class in order to \n\noffer better opportunities to the workers. Besides its economic role, Cooperatives were also part \n\nof a broader social movement with political aims of transforming society. At that time, \n\nCooperatives were related to special-interest groups. That means, they usually served purposes \n\nwhich were not transversal to all society members but specific to a restricted group of people \n\n[28].  \n\nHowever, at some point, a new cooperative trend has started to arise. Despite inspired by the \n\nsame ideals and having the same legal forms, they had a different nature in the way they \n\nprovided essential services of interest to all members of a community, not just a part of it [28]. \n\nAmong the first Cooperatives that met the needs of a whole community, the energy \n\nCooperatives, which will be subject of analysis ahead, are some of the clearest and most \n\nsignificant examples of this trend.         \n\n \n\nCooperatives have been addressing the community issues for over 150 years, and the last \n\ndevelopment relevant to the evolution of cooperative movement occurred towards the end of the \n\nlast century with the enlargement of Cooperatives\u2019 aims to embrace society\u2019s benefit. Though \n\nearly Cooperatives were only concerned in granting benefits to their members, the pursuit of the \n\npublic interest was not their objective. In other words, their explicit aim was to benefit members \n\nthrough trade with them and the community\u2019s well-being was an unintended consequence. \n\nHowever, in the last few decades of the 20th century the well-being of society as a whole made \n\nits first appearance as an explicit goal for the Cooperative firm. In the new community \n\nCooperatives arising today these evolutionary paths intertwine to give birth to a highly complex \n\nand diversified category of Cooperative organisations [28]. But before proceeding, how can we \n\nexplain to someone what is a Cooperative? \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n57 \n\n \n\nBy the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Recommendation No. 193 on the Promotion of \n\nCooperatives 2002 a Cooperative is defined as [29]: \n\n \n\u201cAn autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, \n\nsocial and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned  \n\nand democratically controlled enterprise.\u201d \n\n \nILO Recommendation 193, paragraph 2 \n\n \nThis definition has been adopted from the International Cooperative Alliance Statement on \n\nCooperative Identity 1995, and nowadays is accepted worldwide. The same document states the \n\nseven principles to which Cooperatives must comply (Figure 36):  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 36. The seven Cooperative principles  \n\n \n\nIn relation to economic terms, Cooperatives are a distinct kind of business organisation because \n\nthey have a different model of ownership. This means, Cooperatives are enterprises that are \n\nowned by their users rather than by their investors (as is the case of capitalist corporations) so \n\nthey are simultaneously members and users of the firm and their ownership rights take a very \n\nspecific configuration. Therefore, as democratic and participatory organisations, Cooperatives\u2019 \n\nnet earnings are usually divided equity and equality among the members according to the \n\nvolume of transactions they have realised with the firm, and all voting rights are shared among \n\nthe members according to their relative amount of transactions, or, more simply, on a \u201cone \n\nmember, one vote\u201d basis [30]. \n\n \n\nNowadays, as mentioned above, there are a new community Cooperatives slowly arising. These \n\nhighly complex and diversified model of Cooperative organisations, identified as \u201csocial \n\nenterprises\u201d are emerging where some different types of stakeholders have a strong appeal in \n\nbecoming owners whilst share mutual interests and visions. Among their interests are a \n\nsustainable development, social inclusion and poverty reduction, and the access to energy as a \n\ncritical issue for development processes, including for eradicating poverty and helping to \n\nprovide basic human needs [31]. In these cases, Cooperatives may enjoy competitive advantages \n\nthrough a privileged \u201cwin-win\u201d relationship with the key stakeholder groups.

In fact, there are \n\nsome barriers that help to explain why Cooperatives face an unequal and sometimes difficult \n\ndevelopment across Europe (Figure 37).  \n\nThe most evident is that, as no organisational model is universal, it\u2019s only in a number of \n\nsituations depending on each context that these models seem adequate, but let\u2019s forget for now \n\nthis topic once it will be explored further ahead in relation to RES Cooperatives. Second, as all \n\norganisational models, Cooperatives also suffer from economic barriers. These weaknesses are \n\noften reinforced by \u201cbarriers to entry\u201d that disable Cooperatives to take advantage of their \n\nvalences to survive and develop. Third, the development of Cooperatives may be hindered by \n\nthe way in which they are perceived and understood by a number of stakeholders \u2013 this refers to \n\nlegitimacy issues [32].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 37. Reasons that prevent the Cooperatives\u2019 development \n\n \n\nOne of the most challenging obstacles faced by Cooperatives is definitely how hard is to gather \n\nenough funds particularly in capital-intensive markets, such as the RES industry. Commonly, \n\nnon-investor-owned firms are less attractive to investors seeking to maximise the return of their \n\ninvestments. Moreover, members can deny the entry of such non-member investors (external \n\ninvestors) because they want to protect their common ideals from traditional profit-\n\nmaximisation behaviours. For those two reasons, cooperative capital is usually limited to the \n\namount raised from the members. This often leads to under-capitalisation, which prevents the \n\nfirm from entering a market that requires a large capital base.  \n\nNevertheless, two solutions may be found, but both have their cons. First, gathering a very large \n\nnumber of members may enable to obtain a sufficient amount of capital. In this case, the \n\nCooperative organisation becomes much more difficult to run in a democratic way and can lose \n\nthe ground for its trust-related assets. Second, despite their reluctance, members can eventually \n\nopen the capital to external investors. But in this case, under the pressure of external \n\nshareholders expecting returns on their investment and decision-making power equal to it, the \n\nCooperative may gradually transform and resemble a for-profit firm, thereby invalidating \n\ncertain of its assets [32]. According to studies, the limited access to capital is hindered by some \n\nfactors which industrial economists call \u201cbarriers to entry\u201d (Figure 38).  \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 38. The biggest challenges that all Cooperatives face \n\n \n\nAll these obstacles may prevent a new player from entering a market, despite its potential \n\ncompetitive advantages. In other words, Cooperatives may be the most efficient solutions in a \n\nnumber of cases, but if they do not have access to the market for instance because of the \n\nexistence of a monopoly, due to large economies of scale, or because of an unfavourable \n\nlegislation, such efficiency will remain theoretical and not be converted into market shares [32]. \n\n \n\nWhen a Cooperative decide to gather capital whether through fresh members and external \n\ninvestors, a new issue usually comes up\u2026people do not know what a Cooperative is. When \n\nsomeone thinks business and economic activity, they spontaneously see the traditional for-profit \n\nbusiness model. On the other side, when people think about enterprises that have the social or \n\nenvironmental needs on the baseline, they see a non-profit or NGO model. Definitely, \n\nCooperatives enjoy little legitimacy simply because people, stakeholders, decision-makers do \n\nnot know them. Hence, much of the Cooperatives\u2019 efforts in scaling up their model, or even in \n\nonly surviving, lies in gaining cognitive legitimacy [32]. \n\n \n\n3.2. Emergence of energy Cooperatives \n\nThe environmental and economic trends of the last decades are begging the world to urgently \n\nrethink the current energy systems. Thereby, due to the ever rising concerns over ecological \n\nsustainability, market volatility, increasing energy prices as well as security of energy supply, \n\nthe world over the last years have been trying to transform the energy system of the past \n\ntowards a more sustainable system of energy supply and production. Slowly the classical \n\nregime, characterised by highly centralised energy infrastructures, is switching for a different \n\nand decentralised energy model, and at the grassroots level this has included the establishment \n\nof \u201cnew\u201d types of socio-economic organisations as the revival of energy Cooperatives and other \n\nforms of local or community based ownership of RE technologies (Figure 39).  \n\n \n\nBarriers \nto entry\n\nGovernment \nregulations\n\nCustomer \nloyalty         \n\n(or inertia)\n\nDistributor \nagreements\n\nSize of \ninvestments\n\nEconomies \nof scale\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39. Reasons behind the revival of energy cooperatives [31] \n\n \n\nSupported by the raising awareness on climate changes and the introduction of RES policies, \n\nthis new generation of energy Cooperatives, commonly known as RES Cooperatives, are \n\ndemocratising the energy sector through producing, selling, consuming and, in the particular \n\ncase of this work, energy providing. These organisations can be considered a serious solution to \n\novercome the lack of institutions and policy, and the lack of enterprises, organisation and \n\nhuman capacity.  \n\n \n\nLet\u2019s see the several reasons why RES Cooperatives are an alternative solution to the traditional \n\nand big energy providers (Figure 40). The energy supply at a reasonable price is one of the \n\nissues of particular concern to most RES Cooperatives. Moreover, through this firms consumers \n\ncan reduce their environmental impact (by relying on RES), strengthen the market for cleaner \n\nenergy and encourage the building of more RES power plants. By becoming a member, the \n\ncitizen is encouraged to active participate in local and national energy policy discussions and \n\nthus can easily see the implications of their efforts as a contribution to a better environment and \n\nenergy future. Beside that, RES Cooperatives can also promote local development by creating \n\ngreen jobs or offering additional services such as microfinance, better infrastructure or technical \n\ntraining and assistance on innovative and productive end uses. [31]. Finally they distinguished \n\nthemselves from other market players, in the way mainstream electricity undertakings have no \n\nincentive in reducing the consumption of their customers, because this would simultaneously \n\ninduce costs and reduce their turnover. RES Cooperatives, on the contrary, are much more \n\nlegitimate in promoting the reduction of consumption, as this is in line with the interests of the \n\nconsumers who are controlling the organisation [32].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 40.

However, thanks to recent European liberalisation \n\nof the electricity market an increasing number of RES Cooperative's movements have emerged \n\nall over Europe after a historical state monopoly, supported by the dissatisfaction of consumers \n\nand their desire to have a word to say about their energy\u2019s costs and the origin of their energy. \n\nAmong the pioneers there were EWS in Germany and Ecopower in Belgium [32].  \n\n \n\nAlthough RES Cooperatives offer numerous advantages in terms of both economic efficiency \n\nand citizen involvement, the truth is that they still represent a small share within the European \n\nRES market. Basically, the RES market could be divided in two parts (Figure 41):  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 41. The two parts of the RES market \n\n \n\nAccording to the Eurostat energy reports (Figure 42), in terms of production the share of RES \n\n(biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind and solar energy) in the total production of \n\nenergy in the EU has evolved from 9 to 14% between 2005 and 2012, and from 15 to 24% if we \n\nonly consider electricity (Figure 43).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 42. Share of RES in the EU (2005-2012) \n\n \n\nA side note for the fact that, for instance, from 2005 to 2009 the proportion of this energy \n\nproduced by RES Cooperatives, however, remains weak although growing: from 1 or 2% in \n\nSouthern and Eastern Europe, to 6% in Belgium and France and an estimate of 15% in \n\nScandinavian countries [32]. \n\n \n\nBesides production of renewable energy, a related market is that of the supply of the produced \n\nenergy, particularly in the form of electricity. This market is even more difficult to enter for \n\nRES Cooperatives, as it has only recently been liberalised and is still controlled by a small \n\nnumber of powerful energy companies. Plus, the electricity grid is often owned by the historical \n\nelectricity provider in each country.

Share of RES-E in the EU (2005-2012) \n\n \n\nIt is evident the rising concerns over ecological sustainability and the adoption and promotion of \n\nthe use of \u201cgreen power\u201d led to an increase of RES share in the total production of energy in the \n\nEU. Looking to data (Figure 43), particularly between 2009 and 2010, we may guess the falling \n\nenergy consumption of 2009 is also related to a strong policy measures to improve energy \n\nefficiency. But it if we analyse carefully and remind the news of that time, it is visible on the \n\ngraph the financial and economic crisis effects in the year 2009 pulling down consumption to its \n\nlowest level. The same way that the increase one year later was due to a combination of severe \n\nweather conditions, which strongly pushed up demand from the residential sector, and economic \n\nrecovery effects [33]. However, other elements have to be taken into consideration such as a \n\ngrowing population. At the same time EU members have set energy efficiency targets for \n\nbuildings and took measures to increase the rate of deep renovations to effectively reduce \n\nenergy demand and create new jobs. The consequences of such acts are visible in the following \n\nyears. \n\n \n\nAt this moment there are several questions that can be asked:  \n\n \n\n? Why the visible benefits of these firms are not the springboard for scaling up the energy \nCooperative movements?  \n\n? Why RES Cooperatives still represent a small share within the European RES market?  \n\n \n\nDespite the common advantages of the RES Cooperative model in response to consumer \n\nconcerns, as mentioned before there is no universal organisational model. Each country has their \n\nown national particularities and even if there are some general principles, there certainly are no \n\nstandard patterns among countries. Thus, it is quite reasonable to say that the development of \n\nthe model depends on each context that a cooperative is fixed. \n\nHowever there are generic barriers transversal to all of them (Figure 44). The first one is the \n\nlimited access to capital, at least in the start-up phase. For instance, the high costs of RES power \n\nplants can be an huge obstacle for setting up new RES projects. Second, for producing energy \n\nbased on RES, another critical limitation is the access to locations for new infrastructures. This, \n\ncombined with the amounts of capital required for the development of the projects, clearly \n\n14.8% 15.4%\n16.1% 17%\n\n19%\n19.7% 21.7%\n\n23.5%\n\n3200\n\n3250\n\n3300\n\n3350\n\n3400\n\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n\nTWh\n\nRES-E Share Gross Electricity Generation\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n63 \n\n \n\nfavoured big players and led to the emergence of an oligopoly. This was clearly confirmed in all \n\nEuropean countries, both for the production and the distribution of RE. \n\nA third barrier concerns to RES-E distribution. In some countries, such distribution is not \n\npossible for RES Cooperatives and even where it is allowed, private consumers and \n\nmunicipalities remained rather passive when dealing with these organisations. In these cases, \n\nthis enables the firms to exploit their information advantage concerning the profitability of RES \n\nprojects, at the expense of consumers and municipalities, who generally accepted what the big \n\ncompanies offered them without realising the more favourable deal they could obtain. In fact, \n\nthere would be many reasons for consumers and municipalities to support the emergence of \n\nRES Cooperatives but given the low awareness of the current energy situation, the level of \n\ndissatisfaction was low.  \n\nIntimately related with the previous obstacle, a fourth barrier is the lack of transparent \n\ninformation enabling the public authority to compare among different offers. Sometimes the \n\nRES projects are too small to fall even under the public procurement scheme. Moreover, as \n\nmost municipalities are involved in \u201cinter-municipal partnerships\u201d for the management of \n\nenergy and many other issues, decisions are taken according to the governance mechanisms of \n\nthese partnerships [32]. \n\nBehind the previously mentioned barriers to entry, the lack of support for this model also \n\nseemed to result from a lack of awareness of RES as public goods with a high potential of \n\ninvolvement of and return to the community. \n\n \n\nFigure 44. Generic barriers that RES Cooperatives have to face \n\n \n\nAccording to studies and their own experience (Figure 45), there are four strategies used by \n\nsome RES Cooperatives to establish their model [32]: \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 45. Strategies adopted by RES Cooperatives to overcome these barriers \n\n \n\nAbout the first two strategies, statements \u201cthrowing down\u201d the big companies and promoting \n\nthe economic assets of RES Cooperatives are surprisingly scarce, and away of public debates. In \n\nfact, these firms are mainly focused in promoting on their normative legitimation (better \n\nenvironmental and democratic solutions) rather than their pragmatic legitimation (advantages \n\ncomparing to the different stakeholder groups). Fundamentally, the most intensive process \n\nobserved in RES Cooperatives is a quest for cognitive legitimation through the definition of \n\ntheir common identity (internal networking) and the establishment of alliances with other \n\npartners, as governments. Hence, RES Cooperatives tried to have their model known and \n\nrecognised by politicians at different levels. For instance, Ecopower use an individual \n\ncommitment of politicians and other resource-rich stakeholders as cooperative members to \n\nincrease the recognition of the model. RES Cooperatives also enjoyed their role of allies of \n\nenvironmental NGOs and simultaneously tried to build a reputation of trustworthy economic \n\npartners [32]. \n\nWhile everything does not depend of RES Cooperatives themselves, the diffusion of their model \n\nwill depend very much on their ability to gather different stakeholders around their project. As \n\nthe power relationships with mainstream businesses seem unfavourable to RES Cooperatives, \n\nmaybe a more dynamic strategy of selective alliances with some of these businesses will be \n\nnecessary to reach a significant share of the market. In any case, the success of the diffusion of \n\nRES Cooperatives will be a key element to assess to what extent the cooperative model is \n\nindeed experiencing a renewal in addressing new social and environmental challenges [32]. \n\n  \n\nIn summary, in the field of RES, Cooperatives appear as a solution to the problem of excessive \n\npower market, provide social and environmental guarantees in a context of asymmetric \n\ninformation and seem more committed to encourage the reduction of energy consumption. \n\nHowever, RSE Cooperatives also have their limitations, in the context of the energy market, \n\nwhich explain their still limited market shares and their difficult development in certain \n\ncontexts. \n\n \n\n3.3. The Cooperatives in European Union law \n\nAs energy and sustainable development are likely to be included as two of the main goals in the \n\nnear future of European development agenda, the role of these organisations are set to become \n\neven more intensive and important in the future of energy markets.   \n\nWith the expected growth of RES Cooperatives\u2019 popularity, a natural consequence seems to be \n\nthat they will require some protection through appropriate legislative framework, policy envi-\n\nronment and enabling conditions, including support measures. These include loan, grant and \n\nsubsidy programmes (including special feed-in tariff rates that encourage community-based or \n\ncooperatively owned energy development), technical assistance and capacity-building, including \n\nDelegitimation of \ndominant models\n\nPromotion of the \nRES Coooperative \n\nmodel\n\nInternal alliances External alliances \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n65 \n\n \n\npartnership programmes with government agencies that help public authorities at all levels to \n\nwork towards their commitment to \u201cenergy for all\u201d [31]. This is in line with the ILO \n\nRecommendation No. 193 on the Promotion of Cooperatives 2002, which specifically notes:  \n\n \n\u201cCooperatives should be treated in accordance with national law and practice and on terms no \n\nless favourable than those accorded to other forms of enterprise and social organisation. \n\nGovernments should introduce support measures, where appropriate, for the activities of \n\ncooperatives that meet specific social and public policy outcomes, such as employment \n\npromotion or the development of activities benefiting disadvantaged groups or regions. Such \n\nmeasures could include, among others and in so far as possible, tax benefits, loans, grants, \n\naccess to public works programmes, and special procurement provisions. \u201c \n\nILO Recommendation 193, paragraph 7 \n\n \n\nThereby, a flexible regulatory environment is essential to promote Cooperatives and in this \n\nparticular case, RSE Cooperatives. Regarding to RES Cooperatives, their promotion can be split \n\ninto three different parts (Figure 46): \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 46. The three ways to promote RES Cooperatives \n\n \n\nSince 2003, time that EC adopted the Regulation on the Statute for the European Cooperative \n\nSociety, which sets the rules for Cooperatives willing to extend their action beyond national \n\nborders, much have been done but there remain much still to do, starting by the most important \n\nthing: the release of a standard law that may protect RES Cooperatives. \n\n \n\nWith the economic crisis of 2009, consumer confidence and levels of trust in business \n\ndrastically fell down, and thus with public attention focused more and more on social and \n\nethical performances of enterprises. After years of debates, the EC published in 2011 its long \n\nawaited new communication: \u201cA renewed EU strategy 2011-2014 for Corporate Social \n\nResponsibility\u201c. By adopting this communication, the EU officially recognised Cooperatives as \n\none the various ways of doing business.  \n\nSoon, their role was empowered when the social entrepreneurship was selected as one of the \n\ntwelve measures announced by the EU to achieve the IEM, as well as the introduction of a short \n\nterm action plan to support the development of social enterprises in its 2011 communications \n\n\u201cTowards a Single Market Act - twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence\u201d and \n\n\u201cCreating a favourable climate for social enterprises, key stakeholders in the social economy \n\nand innovation\u201d. \n\n \n\nAware that these enterprises are active and could be a competitive player, the United Nations \n\nproclaimed 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives and launched several efforts, \n\nincluding the 2012 International Year of Cooperatives Conference in Cyprus, to set the \n\ncooperative movement in the political agenda. Among the discussed topics, the dialogue \n\nbetween cooperatives experts and EU policy markers, the overview of national cooperative \n\nlegislations in Europe and the potential for revision of the European Cooperative Society \n\nregulation, and how Cooperatives could answer to the current economic crisis stand out.  \n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/_getdocument.cfm?doc_id=7010\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/_getdocument.cfm?doc_id=7010\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0206:FIN:EN:PDF\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/social_business/docs/COM2011_682_en.pdf\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/social_business/docs/COM2011_682_en.pdf\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n66 \n\n \n\nIt was also organised another important conference to discuss the cooperative contributions to \n\nthe EU 2020 strategy. Basically, EU 2020 aims for a \u201csustainable economy, putting people and \n\nresponsibility first with a sustained fight against exclusion and a transition to a green \n\neconomy\u201d. As they already act in accordance with these principles, Cooperatives could bring \n\nspecific answers and innovative solutions that aim at contributing to the EU 2020 strategy [34].  \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, and realising that Cooperatives and the cooperative movement should be consulted \n\nand included in drafting new energy policies or implementing existing ones, Cooperatives \n\nEurope (CE) had raised, as part of an EU project on RES Cooperatives, to give voice to the \n\ncooperative business model at European level. The key objectives of this working group are to \n\n[34]: \n\n \n\n? Promote Cooperatives in the European energy agenda and support a decentralised \nenergy strategy in the EU; \n\n? Strengthen visibility at EU level as a respectable agent in the energy and environment \narea and develop a European cooperative energy advocacy strategy with clear targets \n\nfor policy makers; \n\n? Feed cooperation through joint actions and targeted cooperative networks and events. \n\n \n\nFor instance, in 2012 the energy working group hosted two big events, both titled \u201cPower to the \n\nPeople\u201d. The first was within the EU sustainable energy week and the second was \n\nat Cooperatives United in Manchester. With these two events, it was pretended to outline the \n\nbenefits of community energy and how community ownership can be increased [34]. \n\n \n\nSupported by the previous year recognition, the year 2013 started with good news for the \n\ncooperative movement when it was announced the EC proposal to integrate sustainability into \n\ncompanies\u2019 strategies and activities. After all, this is something that Cooperatives have been \n\ndoing for many years, informing members, citizens and consumers of the impact of their \n\nactivities.  \n\nOn 26 June 2013, CE and Rescoop.EU, a project which is seeking to identify all the RE projects \n\nin Europe and promote RES Cooperatives as the next step forward in the energy transition, \n\norganised an event in the framework of the EU sustainable energy week entitled \u201cBig energy: \n\nsmall energy? The role of cooperation for EU\u2019s energy transition\u201d. This event took place at the \n\nEC and the programme had included discussion about overcoming key challenges for \n\nintroducing RE, the cooperative way of achieving the EU energy transition, local and regional \n\nRE partnerships, effects of EU policy on local/regional RE initiatives and the learns from the \n\nEU\u2019s liberalisation approaches [34]. \n\nMaybe influenced by this conference, the history says some days after it was made another step \n\nin the right direction towards a \u201creal recognition\u201d that in Europe there are different ways of \n\ndoing business, particularly Cooperatives enterprises, which equally deserve special attention of \n\npolicy makers, when the EPC adopted by vote a report on the contribution of cooperative model \n\nduring the economic and social crisis, which Europe is still facing today, and a motion for \n\nresolution on the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan [34]. This motion complies with the \n\nplurality of business forms, a principle recognised in the funding treaties of the EU, but which \n\nwas barely mentioned in the EC\u2019s texts since the publication of \u201cA renewed EU strategy 2011-\n\n2014 for Corporate Social Responsibility\u201c, two years before.  \n\n \n\nhttp://www.coopseurope.coop/resources/press-releases/co-operatives-show-eu-how-make-citizens-actors-renewable-energy-transition\nhttp://www.coopseurope.coop/resources/news/power-people-energy-cooperatives-give-inspiring-example-co-operatives-united\nhttp://www.coopseurope.coop/resources/press-releases/co-operatives-show-eu-how-make-citizens-actors-renewable-energy-transition\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/_getdocument.cfm?doc_id=7010\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/_getdocument.cfm?doc_id=7010\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n67 \n\n \n\nSo far, the year 2014 has been a mix of feelings for RES Cooperatives in particular. Despite the \n\nEC\u2019s announcement that a group of experts would be created to build up clear recommendations \n\non cooperative training and education, financing of Cooperatives, and business development \n\nsupport services, they also released the EU 2030 framework for climate and energy policies, \n\nwhich at the moment despite the slightly improved guidelines still does not support local efforts \n\ntowards decentralised energy production. This framework pretends to define the EU\u2019s climate \n\nand energy policies beyond 2020, building on the experience and lessons learnt from the EU \n\n2020 strategy, and according to the first package draft, the national targets have been eliminated \n\nand, as expected, the energy savings target will not be taking into account until the EC review \n\nthe effects of the energy efficiency directive [34].  \n\nIn response to the document, CE asked for three ambitious binding targets at the EU level on: \n\n \n? Energy efficiency; \n? RE share; \n? Reduction for greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). \n\n \n\nCE believes these binding targets need to be broken down into 28 individual national level \n\ntargets ensuring then an equal approach among EU members, once national binding targets \n\ndrive to policy decisions, give investment signals and clarity on the pathways that need to be \n\ntaken by national industries (Figure 47). Only then it is possible to have a stable long-term \n\nframework, which promotes new investments into the energy transition, particularly in RES \n\nCooperatives, in order to reach Europe\u2019s energy autonomy and affirm its leadership in a \n\ncompetitive, green economy.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 47. Framework proposed by Cooperatives Europe that may promote new investments into the energy \n\ntransition, particularly in RES Cooperatives \n\n \n\nIdeally, a market system can only work when all actors (small, medium and big companies) are \n\nincluded and are treated equally. However, the new guidelines keep overlooking the impact that \n\nRES Cooperatives are having in the energy transition, but also helping to better organise the \n\nenergy demand, stabilise the IEM and reinforce indigenous supply sources. It is then expected \n\nthat these guidelines are interfering with existing national and European laws, such as the \n\nrenewable energy Directive 2009/28/EC, which takes into consideration the interests of local \n\nand regional RES generators, but it will be too late to Europe recognise and amend the mistakes \n\nof their recent energy guidelines? \n\n \n\n2014 was a year of parliamentary elections in Europe and it has been argued that the EU ought \n\nto listen its citizens\u2019 discontentment and depending on the results, it could provide, or not, a \n\ncrucial platform for building a stronger parliamentary network of cooperative supporters.  \n\nDespite the result shows the ever increasing euroscepticism, the leadership is still in the hands \n\nof the two biggest political families (EPP and PES/S&amp;D) followed by ALDE and the Greens, \n\nrespectively (Figure 48). Elected the new EPC it is time to select the new EC president by an \n\nabsolute majority, instead of merely approving her/him, as the previous Treaty stated.

Maybe \n\nthe current Ukraine crisis and the linked energy security issue would encourage EC to ensure a \n\nmore balanced policy framework, which includes all types of existing players, particularly RES \n\nCooperatives. \n\n \n\nIn parallel to the promotion made by international organisms, must be also developed efforts by \n\nthe states of each country and the cooperative movement operating there.  \n\nIn general, at this moment it is possible to say the governmental promotional measures can be \n\ndivided into direct promotion of energy Cooperatives and a more general promotion of RES, \n\nwhich may indirectly encourage and support the establishment of RES Cooperatives. \n\nNevertheless, it is of maximum importance that these promotional measures must provide the \n\nconditions under which potential members of Cooperatives will be able to give birth to new \n\nCooperatives, whose autonomy and democratic nature will be respected according to the \n\ncooperative principles and values [31]. \n\nIn relation to the promotion by the cooperative movement, strengthening the vertical structure is \n\nfundamental in enabling RES Cooperatives to reach their full potential in producing sustainable \n\nenergy and creating green jobs [31].  \n\nBy forming national or regional networks of RES Cooperatives is half way to reach the \n\nindividual success. This is important with regard not only to capacity-building and knowledge \n\ntransfer, but also to engage in policy and legislative dialogue and conduct public awareness \n\ncampaigns, protecting thus the interests of each RES Cooperative. Financing for energy \n\ninitiatives is also provided by the cooperative movement.

However, and despite the advantages of \n\nsuch organism, in almost European countries no national federation of Cooperatives exists.  \n\n \n\n4. Case studies analysis \n\n4.1. Introduction and Methodology \n\nIn spite of the EU\u2019s efforts in the recent years, the establishment of an IEM is far from being \n\nconcluded. At the moment, across Europe the path through the full liberalisation has reached \n\ndifferent levels as each MS approached the process in its own way, in accordance to their \n\nnational particularities. However, this long and evolutionary process of market liberalisation has \n\nopened a door for new visions, opportunities and, consequently, new independent energy \n\nplayers, in a number of European countries.  \n\nRES Cooperatives are one of the natural outcomes of this transition and, today more than \n\nyesterday, have the potential to play a big role in response to the 21st century energy challenges \n\nof energy security and supply, as well as promoting RES. Right now they are shaping a new \n\nfuture for the energy market in Europe, giving the chance to the ordinary citizen to own, control \n\nand benefit from their own power and energy efficiency schemes. This last statement is going to \n\nbe the gateway of this work.     \n\n \n\nThus, and inspired by the success of several RES Cooperatives across Europe and with the \n\nmotivation to transform Coop\u00e9rnico as the first green electricity supplier in Portugal, the main \n\ngoals of this work are to understand the potential role that RES Cooperatives may have in the \n\nfuture of the liberalised energy sector not only across Europe, but particularly in Portugal, and \n\nbe a successful guide for any RES Cooperative that aims to get in the national electricity retail \n\nmarket. \n\nTherefore, the first step of this work consists in the characterisation of four different European \n\nelectricity markets (UK, ES, DE, BE), followed by the analysis of the role and experiences that \n\neach one of the selected case studies has faced in their own electricity supply market:    \n\n \n\n? The Co-operative Energy, in United Kingdom (UK): The UK has one of the most \npowerful energy markets in Europe. Regarding to the domestic energy supply market, \n\nthe UK has six major energy companies (British Gas, EDF, Eon, Npower, Scottish \n\nPower and SSE) who supply over 98% of domestic customers. Therefore, The Co-\n\noperative Energy was selected with the aim to understand how a RES Cooperative can \n\nbe an alternative in such a competitive market and how did they manage to do it. \n\n? Som energia, in Spain (ES): Comparing the two energy sectors, it is possible to say the \nSpanish electricity market is quite similar to the Portuguese one, including the \n\nlegislation in force. Moreover, both countries share an organised energy market, \n\nMIBEL. Because of these reasons is recommended to study the most reputable RES \n\nCooperative in the Iberian Peninsula. \n\n? EWS, in Germany (DE): It is possible to say the EWS is probably one of the most \nrespectable entities within the cooperative movement. EWS became an electricity \n\nsupplier even before the liberalisation of the energy markets. Because of its story, \n\nmotivations, business model and structure, as well as the European system where the \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n70 \n\n \n\nRES Cooperative operates, is natural that this RES Cooperative was chosen as a case \n\nstudy. \n\n? Ecopower, in Belgium (BE): A work in which the central theme are the RES \nCooperatives, it is inevitable not to mention the EcoPower. In fact, this RES \n\nCooperative is one of the pioneers of the movement and probably the best example to \n\nstudy regarding to electricity supply activity. Moreover, the RES Cooperative is one of \n\nthe founders of the European group RESCoop. \n\n \n\nWith this study, it is expected a real assessment regarding the possible positive and negative \n\neffects not only for Coop\u00e9rnico, but for a RES Cooperative that aims to operate in the \n\nPortuguese electricity market. \n\n  \n\nThe second step of the work is related to the comparison between the four selected markets with \n\nthe Portuguese case. Moreover, the current situation of the liberalisation in the national \n\nelectricity system, as well as the legislation to which it is adjacent, plus a brief description of the \n\ncurrent electricity suppliers companies operating in Portugal will be studied.  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, all the steps and necessary requirements for a energy cooperative to become a new \n\nelectricity supplier in Portugal will be compiled.  \n\n \n\n4.2. Electricity Sector in the United Kingdom \n\n4.2.1. An Overview of the British Liberalised Market \n\n \n\nFigure 49. United Kingdom and its countries \n\n \n\nThe British electricity market has four distinct geographical territories (Figure 49): the main \n\nisland divided by Wales in the South, Scotland in the North with England between, plus the \n\nNorthern Ireland in the West of the main island.  \n\n \n\nAs introduced above in chapter one, the UK was the first European country to launch concrete \n\nand innovative measures that led to the deregulation and liberalisation of its electricity market. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n71 \n\n \n\nThe success of the initiative was so evident that shortly after it inspired the neighbouring \n\nEuropean electricity markets to follow and adopt the same line of policies.  \n\n \n\nIt is hard to define the British energy model; however there are some main features that \n\ncharacterised the British liberalisation process [36]:  \n\n \n\n? The creation of a wholesale spot market, as the main price-setting arena for wholesale \nelectricity sales; \n\n? The creation of retail competition, so that all consumers can freely choose their \nelectricity supplier; \n\n? The separation between competitive sectors and non-competitive sectors, including the \nclear corporate separation between the four activities. \n\n \n\nBefore the nineties\u2019 liberalisation, the generation and transmission in England and Wales were \n\nresponsibility of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB)4, whilst in Scotland and \n\nNorthern Ireland the task was carried out by North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB), \n\nSouth of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB) and Northern Ireland Electricity Board (NIEB), \n\nrespectively. All these companies were nationalised [37]. \n\n \n\nRegarding the distribution and supply, whilst in Scotland and Northern Ireland these activities \n\nwere also under control of NSHEB, SSEB and NIEB, in England and Wales they were provided \n\nby twelve regional Area Electricity Boards (AEB).  \n\n \n\nBesides the CEGB, the Electricity Act 1957 established also an Electricity Council, which was \n\nthe policy-making body for the Electricity Supply Industry [38]. In England and Wales the \n\nElectricity Council, established in 1957, played an important coordinating role in the electricity \n\nsystem, bringing together directors from the CEGB and AEB. \n\n \n\nBefore the liberalisation, and concerning the transmission network, there were four electricity \n\ntransmission grids operated independently, by each one of the companies previously \n\nenumerated: CEGB, NSHEB, SSEB and NIEB [37].  \n\n \n\n                                                      \n4 CEGB\u2019 responsibilities were to develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system \nof electricity supply in entire England and Wales, including the production or acquisition of electricity \n\nand to provide that energy for the AEB\u2019s distribution. It also had power to provide electricity to the \n\nScottish Boards or electricity undertakings outside UK [38].  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 50. Main features of the pre British liberalisation \n\n \n\nUntil the late eighties, these nationalised companies fully dominated the British electricity \n\nsector (Figure 50). Nevertheless, the scenario changed when the British government, led on that \n\nperiod by Margaret Thatcher, introduced for the first time some liberalisation, followed by \n\nreorganisation and privatisation measures, into the electricity system. Basically, it was the kick \n\nstarter for the construction of the British electricity market as it\u2019s known today, and that inspired \n\nthe creation of the European IEM.      \n\n \n\nThereby, the first step towards the post British electricity system liberalisation were made still \n\nin the early eighties, by the 1983 Energy Act, that removed the requirement that only AEB could \n\nsupply electricity [39]. \n\nThe document imposed on the AEB the duty to buy electricity on \u201cfair terms\u201d from a private \n\ngenerator or supplier and allow it to use the transmission and distribution system. However, the \n\n1983 Energy Act had a very limited impact with only a small number of private companies \n\nentering the market, because of excessive costs of third party access to the CEGB\u2019s national grid \n\n[40]. \n\n \n\nThe second wave of new polities came with privatisation measures, whose main challenge was \n\nto reorganise the sector in order to introduce a real competition among the players. On that time, \n\nthere were some constraints to competition in transmission and distribution networks, once \n\nthese activities were natural monopolies. Thus, it has only been possible to attempt to create real \n\nmarket competition in generation and supply activities. \n\nSupply\n\n12 AEB in England \nand Wales\n\nNSHEB SSEB NIEB\n\nDistribution\n\n12 AEB in England \nand Wales\n\nNSHEB SSEB NIEB\n\nTransmission\n\n( despite the grids were connected between themselves, they operated completely separately )\n\nCEGB NSHEB SSEB NIEB\n\nGeneration\n\nCEGB NSHEB SSEB NIEB\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n73 \n\n \n\nAs a result, in the late eighties the preparation for privatisation begun (Electricity Act 1989\n5\n), \n\nand between 1990 and 1993, the generating and AEB companies in England and Wales, plus the \n\nNSHEB, SSEB and NIEB were all sold off [37]. \n\nFor instance, the CEGB\u2019s breakup led to three new generating companies, called Powergen, \n\nNational Power and Nuclear Electric, and a transmission company entitled National Grid. \n\nDespite all the companies were down as private, with exception of Nuclear Electric that \n\nremained publicly owned until 1996, they were initially protected from unwanted takeover bids \n\nby the British government\u2019s Golden Shares scheme. This meant that investors could acquire \n\nsignificant shareholdings in electricity companies but would not be able to gain a controlling \n\ninterest [37].  \n\n \n\nRegarding the Scottish companies, both were privatised as two vertically integrated regulated \n\nutilities in 1991, free to sell electricity into the English and Welsh market: The Scottish Hydro-\n\nElectric (SHE), which later became Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), and the Scottish \n\nPower (SP) [36].  \n\nOnce there was a strong political opposition in Scotland to the Thatcher privatisation \n\nprogramme and the break-up process of the existing companies, SHE and SP remained \n\nresponsible not only for the generation activity, but also for transmission and distribution \n\nnetworks. As Scotland was, and is today, characterised by sparsely-populated areas, the British \n\ngovernment accepted that these companies were also charged of the supply of electricity [36]. \n\nFinally, in respect to Northern Ireland, it was followed the same model as in Scotland. That \n\nmeans, NIEB\u2019s privatisation led also to a new fully vertically integrated company: Northern \n\nIreland Electricity (NIE).  \n\n \n\nRegarding the 12 AEB, they were also privatised and converted into 12 Regional Electricity \n\nCompanies (REC): 1- East Midlands Electricity; 2- Eastern Electricity; 3- London Electricity; \n\n4- Merseyside and North Wales Electricity Board (Manweb); 5- Midlands Electricity; 6- \n\nNorthern Electricity; 7- North Western Electricity Board; 8-  South Eastern Electricity Board; 9- \n\nSouth Wales Electricity; 10- South Western Electricity; 11- Southern Electric and 12- Yorkshire \n\nElectricity (Figure 51).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 51. Regional Electricity Companies \n\n                                                      \n5 Among the several objectives published in The Electricity Act 1989, the document laid down the \n\nfoundations for the government\u2019s privatisation plans. For instance, the Act introduced a competitive \n\nmarket into electricity generation and supply, and a system of independent regulation responsible for \n\nensuring an efficient and competitive electricity market and for protecting customer interests [41].  \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_and_North_Wales_Electricity_Board\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Western_Electricity_Board\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Eastern_Electricity_Board\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\nJust like the new generation companies, the 12 REC were protected by the Golden Shares \n\nscheme [37].  \n\n \n\nTrying to bring competition into the industry, the two biggest generation companies (National \n\nPower and Powergen) were allowed to supply electricity directly to larger consumers while the \n\nRECs were allowed to invest in generating capacity until a certain ammount of power [37].  \n\nThus, by 1996, National Power and Powergen were required to sell off some of their generating \n\ncapacity. The purchaser was the largest REC, Eastern Electric, despite the company exceeded \n\nthe previous limit of only obtaining 15% of its power from its own generating capacity, and this \n\nbreech of the retail/generating limit was then followed by SP when it acquired the REC Manweb \n\n[37]. \n\nIn order to promote this requirement and to allow a much greater degree of integration across \n\nthe whole industry, in 1998 the Labour government, that had been elected the previous year, \n\ndecided to allow the generators to buy retail providers as long as they sold off more of their \n\ngenerating capacity [37].  \n\n \n\nAt the same time, in 1995, the Golden Shares protection system scheme ran out, and the \n\nconsequence was the immediately take-over of the private companies, especially seven of REC, \n\nby outside players, particularly American undertakings [36].  \n\nTwo years later, in 1997, and taking into account the industry regulator\u2019s concern that REC \n\nwere using their effective regional monopolies on distribution to subsidise their retail activities, \n\nthe companies were required to legally separate their distribution and retail activities, although \n\nthey could still continue to own both operations. \n\nThis decision, and the rising competitive environment in the sector, led that most of the \n\nAmerican companies sold their interests in Britain, and a new set of European owners took \n\ncontrol of the electricity sector in UK.  \n\n \n\nAs one of the four elements that characterise the price of electricity charged to the end-user \n\ncustomer is the wholesale price charged by the generators, another innovation of the British \n\nmodel in order to introduce more competition was the creation of a wholesale spot market in \n\n1990, Electricity Pool of England and Wales, where the generating companies could sell their \n\noutput energy at changing prices in response to the demands of the REC and any new entrants \n\non the supply side [37].  \n\nSimple economic theory dictates that a reduction in supply will force up price and many \n\nobservers suggested that the electricity pool was open to manipulation by the large generators \n\n[37]. By other words, they could together set the system marginal price for the bulk of the time \n\nthrough limiting available generating capacity. In addition, the electricity pool was more than \n\noften bypassed in favour of longer term bilateral contracts, known as Contract for Differences, \n\nthat hedged the risk of the volatile pool prices.  \n\nA review of the Electricity Pool of England and Wales led to its replacement in March 2001 by \n\nthe New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) and four years later, in 2005, due to more \n\nrestructuring of the electricity system, followed with further integration of generating and \n\nsupply, NETA evolved to the British Electricity Transmission and Trading Arrangements \n\n(BETTA), when Scotland joined into the market for the first time [37].  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n75 \n\n \n\nSince end of 2007, there is a wholesale electricity market operating in Ireland and Northern \n\nIreland on an All-Island basis, called Single Electricity Market (SEM). Basically, the SEM was \n\ndesigned to provide for the least cost source of electricity generation to meet customer demand \n\nat any one time across the island, while also maximising long-term sustainability and reliability \n\n[42]. \n\n \n\nThe British wholesale market have been evolving, and today, besides BETTA, there are three \n\ndifferent organised energy markets operating in the country: the first independent power \n\nexchange created in the UK, at the same time than NETA, called APX Power UK, the \n\nIntercontinental Exchange [43], and in 2010 it was launched the latest market for UK energy \n\ncontracts, Nasdaq OMX N2EX. From the three organised energy markets, APX Power UK, \n\nformerly The United Kingdom Power Exchanges -UKPX, is the cornerstone of the UK spot \n\nmarket and is used by members on a 24/7 basis for the majority of their within day balancing \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nNow that is overviewed the main lines of the liberalisation process in the UK to the present, it \n\nwill be also interesting to understand what such measures brought and caused in the industry \n\n(Figure 52). As any other electricity system, the British one is composed by four sectors (Figure \n\n53): Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Supply. \n\n \n\nStarting by the last activity, the British retail market was opened up in three stages. Firstly, on \n\nprivatisation of the electricity sector in 1990, only industrial customers with consumption \n\ngreater than 1 MW a year were allowed to choose their electricity supplier. Four years later, in \n\n1994, the open market was extended to customers with a 100 kW annual demand and since \n\n1999 the British retail market is fully opened to competition, when domestic customers were \n\nallowed to switch its electricity supplier whenever they want [37]. \n\nAs result, the number of electricity supply companies has increased significantly with new \n\ncompanies entering the retail market. The only thing they need to operate is a license to supply \n\nelectricity. Nevertheless, as it will be discussed next, the market is completely dominated by six \n\ncompanies, with many of the licensed operators acting as simply agents for these companies.   \n\n \n\nAll of the leading six supply companies are also established in the generation sector, through \n\nsubsidiaries, with significant shares. At the same time, more than 50 new generating companies \n\nhad entered the generation market, through a license agreement. \n\n \n\nWhilst in England and Wales, the transmission network system is still responsibility of National \n\nGrid, due to vertical unbundling in Scotland the transmission network is responsibility of the \n\nsubsidiaries of SP (SP Transmission) and SSE (SSE Transmission). In Northern Ireland the TSO \n\nis EirGrid, company which purchased SONI (the previous TSO) to NIE [44].   \n\nThe TSOs\u2018 statutory duties, provided under The Electricity Act 1989, The Utilities Act 2000\n6\n \n\nand their transmission licenses, are among others the developing and maintaining of an efficient, \n\n                                                      \n6 The Utilities Act 2000 was fundamental in amending the industry structure and regulatory framework. \n\nThe purpose of the document was to advocate market development through integrated regulation of the \n\ngas and electricity markets, the separation of electricity supply and distribution, and the creation of the \n\nnecessary framework to underpin the introduction of NETA. Moreover, the document also provided \n\nguidelines to protect the interests of consumers, wherever possible through the promotion of competition. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n76 \n\n \n\ncoordinated and economic transmission system, which facilitate competition in electricity \n\ngeneration and supply and protect the environment [41]. \n\n \n\nIn respect to the distribution sector, in the beginning seven of the 12 REC were acquired by \n\nAmerican companies, which later sold their shares to European firms. Nevertheless, they were \n\nalways in control of the local monopoly distribution networks in their franchise areas. At the \n\nmoment, there are 15 licensed DSO in the UK, held by 8 companies that will be identified right \n\nafter. Besides the 15 licensed DSO, there are also 7 Independent DSO (IDSO) licenses. \n\nThe REC\u2019 licenses set out a number of public service and other obligations such as ensuring \n\ncontinuity and supply, non-discrimination, prohibition of cross-subsidies, price controls and the \n\nobligation to contract for a specific amount of capacity from non-fossil fuels each year [41]. \n\nThere is another license, referred as second tier licenses, required for those suppliers who wish \n\nto sell to any customer attached to the distribution networks. RECs can also obtain second tier \n\nlicenses to enable them to compete in distribution networks other than their own.  \n\nSP Energy Networks and SSE Power Distribution hold second tier licenses and can supply \n\ncustomers across the UK electricity market, likewise any second tier license holders can supply \n\ncustomers in Scotland [41].  \n\n \n\nThe Electricity Act 1989 also introduced a regulatory system headed by a Director General of \n\nSupply (DGS), responsible for ensuring an efficient and competitive electricity market and for \n\nprotecting customer interests.  \n\nIn 1999, the regulatory offices for electricity and gas were merged to create the Office for Gas \n\nand Electricity Markets (Ofgem).  \n\nOfgem is governed by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GAEMA) and its powers are \n\nprovided under The Gas Act 1986, The Electricity Act 1989 and The Utilities Act 2000. Ofgem, \n\nthrough advocating competition, is focussed on promoting and protecting the interests of gas \n\nand electricity customers and licensing and monitoring the gas and electricity companies, taking \n\naction where necessary to ensure compliance [41].  \n\nNorthern Ireland has its own regulatory body: The Northern Ireland Authority for Utility \n\nRegulation (UREGNI), previously known as Ofreg. UREGNI\u2019 duties are similar to Ofgem\u2019, and \n\nincludes the promotion of competition in the electricity industry, the protection of electricity \n\nand gas consumers, and the arbitrary in disputes between consumer and supplier [45]. \n\nRegarding the monopoly of transmission and distribution networks, they were subject to \n\nindependent regulation. \n\n                                                                                                                                                            \nA number of the provisions within the Act seek improved regulation through transparency, consistency \n\nand predictability [41]. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 52.

Despite, more \n\nthan 60 companies own nowadays power stations across the UK, many of these are small power \n\nproducers with relatively low capacity [37]. In fact, the 10 biggest generating companies (RWE \n\nNpower, E.ON Powergen, SSE, SP, Centrica, British Energy, International Power, Drax Power, \n\nAES and EDF Energy) own more than 80% of the total UK power capacity.  \n\nThe other 20% is responsibility of companies such as Amegni Renewables, Dong Energy, \n\nCommunity Windpower, Ecogen, Ecotricity, Eneco, Energy 4-All Cooperative, Enertrag, \n\nExxon, among others. \n\n \n\nIn Great Britain, there are four TSOs: National Grid operating in England and Wales, SSE and \n\nSP Energy Networks in Scotland and finally, Eirgrid in Northern Ireland. Their job is to \n\nmaintain the flow of generated electricity through to the regional distribution networks, which \n\nare controlled by eight companies (Figure 54): Electricity North West, Northern Ireland \n\nElectricity, Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Energy Power Distribution, Scottish \n\nPower Energy Networks, UK Power Networks and Western Power Distribution [44]. \n\n \n\nBesides the 15 licensed DSO, there are 7 Independent DSO (IDSO) licenses: Energetics \n\nElectricity Limited, EP Electricity Limited, Harlaxton Energy Networks Limited, Independent \n\nPower Networks Limited, The Electricity Network Company Limited, UK Power Networks \n\n(IDNO) Ltd and Utility Assets Limited [44]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 54.

Domestic electricity supply market shares, by company [46] \n\n \n\nThe market is dominated by 6 big companies, Centrica/British Energy, EDF Energy, RWE \n\nNpower, E.ON Powergen, SP and Scottish and Southern Energy. Besides the Big 6, there are 18 \n\nsmaller suppliers, making a total of 24 electricity suppliers operating in the UK. \n\n \n\nAccording to Ofgem\u2019s report [46], in January 2014 the Big 6 market share was between 11% \n\nand 25% (Figure 55). It is important to highlight the solid growth that smaller suppliers are \n\nregistering. The reasons are several, and include the low level of trust in the bigger companies, \n\ndissatisfaction by the service provided, easy access to information and rising awareness for a \n\nnew energetic paradigm, besides the obviously monetary savings. Other interpretation may be \n\nrelated to the fact that the big 6 energy companies are not competing as hard as they did in the \n\npast to win customers from each other.  \n\n \n\nIn the category of smaller suppliers, stands out companies as The Co-operative Energy, \n\nEcotricity, Good Energy, Utilita, First Utility, Spark Energy, Ovo Energy, Green Energy, Flow \n\nEnergy, Utility Warehouse, among others, which besides collecting a market share around 1% \n\nare slowly increasing in the number of customers. Of the 18 smaller suppliers currently in the \n\ndomestic market, only four have expanded to around 1/4 million customers, including The Co-\n\noperative Energy. \n\nThe path for these companies, as the following one, is long and tortuous, because there are \n\nsignificant barriers that prevent their expansion.  \n\n \n\n4.2.3. The Co-operative Energy \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\nOne of the smaller suppliers that are becoming an alternative to the big 6 energy, is The Co-\n\noperative Energy. Born in 2010, is the only Cooperative supplier in the electricity market, and \n\nbecause of its values and mission has been awarded with a couple prizes, including the \n\nConsumer Action Award at the Which? Award 2011 and the Best Energy Provider Award at the \n\nConsumer Moneyfacts Awards 2012 [47].  \n\n \n\nThe Co-operative Energy is part of The Midcounties Co-operative, the largest independent co-\n\noperative in the UK with more than 430 000 members [47]. The number of members is updated \n\nevery three years, when the members who don\u2019t trade see their membership canceled.  \n\nResult of the cooperative movement that was established in the beginning of the ninetienth \n\ncentury, The Midcounties Co-operative\u2019s history began in the middle of the same century, when \n\nsome people realised that they could achieve far more by acting collectively than they ever \n\nwould alone. \n\n \n\nThus, inspired by the first successful retail cooperative society that was brought to life by the \n\nRochdale Pioneers, in 1844, many people decided to copy the model and values of success (, \n\nthat today are followed by every Cooperative), and set up their own local Cooperative stores in \n\ntowns and villages across the UK.  \n\nYears later, some of the Cooperatives combined with others to eventually form The Midcounties \n\nCo-operative. Among them, are the Swindon in 1853, Gloucester in 1860, Walsall and Chipping \n\nNorton both in 1866, Oxford in 1872 and Cinderford in 1874. The reasons why they merged are \n\nsimple: partly to increase their purchasing power and partly to compete more effectively against \n\nthe conventional retailers. At the end of the twentieth century, more mergers led to two big \n\nsocieties in the Midcounties region: \n\n \n\n? Oxford, Swindon and Gloucester Cooperative Society (OSG); \n? West Midlands Cooperative Society (WMCS). \n\n   \n\nIn 2005, the members of these two Cooperatives decided to do one last merge, and the result \n\nwas The Midcounties Co-operative. Nowadays, this powerful Cooperative has several business \n\ngroups, including Food, Funeralcare, Travel, Pharmacy, Post Office or Child Care, among \n\nothers. However, only in 2010, the society entered in the Energy business, through the creation \n\nof The Co-operative Energy [47]. \n\n \n\nFocusing in the case study, at the moment The Co-operative Energy covers England, Wales and \n\nScotland, i.e., the entire UK. Moreover, they are committed to providing low carbon energy \n\nwith simple tariffs with clear billing. Bu how they will achieve that? \n\n \n\nWith no shareholders to please, but its members, The Co-operative Energy aims to be Britain\u2019s \n\nmost trusted energy supplier, through [47]: \n\n \n\n? Trusted on price: the Cooperative ensures to keep the prices consistently competitive. \nMoreover they aims to keep their tariffs as simple and transparent as possible, made up \n\nof a monthly fixed charge and a single unit price for energy consumed; \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n81 \n\n \n\n? Trusted on fairness: Like all Cooperatives, The Co-operative Energy is ethical in its \ndealing with people and businesses. That means, new customers won't be favoured over \n\nexisting ones and there will be periodical reports regarding the energy costs, how much \n\nmoney the Cooperative make and how that profit is shared between members and \n\nreinvested in new projects.  \n\n? Trusted on service: It is Cooperative\u2019s intentions to keep all their operations in Britain. \n? Trusted on environment: Besides supporting new RES projects across the country, the \n\nCooperative aims to keep the carbon content of its electricity below half the national \n\naverage.  \n\n \n\nBased on these guidelines, two years after its formation and granted the license by the energy \n\nregulator, in 2013 the Cooperative achieved the mark of 150 000 customers, becoming then an \n\nseriously alternative to the big 6 energy suppliers. Currently, The Co-operative Energy is the \n\nelectricity supplier of nearly 250 000 customers in the entire country [48].  \n\nThis is the result of the creation of a wider range of products to its customers. For instance, the \n\nCooperative launched a new version of its competitively priced Pioneer variable tariff. \n\nMoreover, The Co-operative Energy also now offers a range of fixed-term tariffs to new and \n\nexisting customers, which guarantee prices for one, two and three years. \n\n \n\nIt is not mandatory to become a member, when a customer chooses The Co-operative Energy as \n\nits electricity supplier. However, it\u2019s quite easy and cheap to become a member, around \u20ac 1, and \n\nonce a member the citizen in return will receive 1 point. Obviously, the member will get more \n\npoints the more he invests in the Cooperative. Then, twice a year it will distributed a profit \n\nshare, based on how many points the member have accumulated [47].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 56. The Midcounties Co-operative membership card \n\n \n\nA fairly good idea is that, customers of Co-operative Energy become members of The \n\nMidcounties Co-operative, alongside customers of Midcounties\u2019 other businesses (Figure 56). \n\nThus, the member can accumulate points when shop in the cooperative stores or online [47].   \n\n \n\n4.3. Electricity Sector in Spain \n\n4.3.1. An Overview of the Spanish Liberalised Market \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 57. Spain and its autonomous communities \n\n  \n\nThe Kingdom of Spain is a Constitutional monarchy located on the Iberian Peninsula in south-\n\nwestern Europe, and is composed by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities with \n\nvarying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution (Figure 57).  \n\nDespite Spain is organisationally structured, once all autonomous communities have their own \n\nelected parliaments, governments, public administrations, budgets and resources, the Spanish \n\nConstitution states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation. \n\n \n\nGoing straight to the point, Spain was one of the first European countries to transpose the First \n\nDirective. In fact, the Spanish electricity liberalisation process started in late November 1997 \n\n[49]. As the liberalisation progress across Europe was presenting low results, the EU members \n\nwere forced to adopt a new demanding framework (Second Directive), which Spain transposed \n\nto its legislation in 2007 [50]. In 2012, it was transposed into Spanish national law the last \n\ndocument regarding the adoption of the Third Directive [51].        \n\n \n\nThe pre liberalisation period, focusing between 1983 and 1996, was characterised by The \n\nNational Energy Plans (PENs). After the global oil crisis, the Spanish government came up \n\nwith large investments programmes in an attempt to regulate the sector\u2019s financial problems. \n\nTherefore, in 1983 an agreement was signed between the main companies and the government \n\nand one year later, the regulation and legal ordering of the Spanish electricity sector was set by \n\nLaw 49/1984. Thus, in 1985, Spain became the first European country to adopt an independent \n\nsystem operator when it was formed a state-owned company, Red Electrica de Espa\u00f1a (REE), \n\nresponsible for the high-voltage transmission assets of all firms in the sector. REE also directed \n\nthe central dispatch of the system [52]. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n83 \n\n \n\nBefore the liberalisation, the generation and distribution sectors were linked, by ownership, to \n\nUNESA7 (a group of companies composed mainly by Endesa (on that period a government-\n\nowned generation company), Iberdrola, Uni\u00f3n Fenosa and Hidcrocant\u00e1brico). In the nineties a \n\nprocess of concentration occurred leading thus to Endesa\u2019s dominant position with the \n\nacquisition of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Sevillana de Electricidad and other subsequent asset consolidations. \n\nAs a result, Endesa achieved half of the Spanish generation share and 40% of the distribution \n\nmarket. The second group, Iberdrola held a generation quota of 29% and 38% for distribution. \n\nThe third and fourth generators, Uni\u00f3n Fenosa and Hidrocant\u00e1brico, had 13% and 6% in \n\ngeneration and 15% and 5% in distribution [52].  \n\nOn that time, a new phenomenon arose: Self generation. It was facilitated by generous pricing \n\nprovisions for excess power sold to the network. Obviously, there were legal limits to the size of \n\nself-generation facilities, which qualify for these pricing terms [53]. \n\n \n\nIn relation to regulation, in 1987 the regime has been organised around The Stable Legal \n\nFramework, or Marco Legal y Estable (MLE) law. Fundamentally, the MLE worked like price \n\ncap regulation, establishing then standard costs for all factors of generation that later were used \n\nto produce tariffs, that generated revenues collected by distribution companies [53]. \n\nThis regulatory regime encouraged efficiency. Since the companies knew what their revenues \n\nwill be under the MLE, they knew that cost reduction will increased profits. \n\n \n\nThe final phase was in the early nineties, when in end of 1994 the Spanish government enacted \n\na new electricity law, known as Law Ordering the National Electricity Sector (LOSEN), which \n\nintended to increase competition and transparency in the sector, but keeping the positive \n\nelements of the MLE. The three principal features of LOSEN were the creation of a regulatory \n\nauthority, The National Commission for the Electricity System (CNSE), requiring competitive \n\nbidding for all new generation and allowing for an \u201cindependent system\u201d for those parties who \n\nseek to bypass the existing national system [53].  \n\n \n\nTherefore, it is possible to conclude that the Spanish electricity sector before the liberalisation \n\noperated as an integrated system (Figure 58). The transmission network and the short term \n\nmanagement of the capacity for generation were in the hands of an independent entity, REE. \n\nThe power generation needs for the entire network were defined by the PENs. Distribution, for \n\nthe most part, was the responsibility of the four large vertically integrated companies. These \n\ncompanies were also responsible for the supply within certain geographic regions and had the \n\nexclusive right to do so. These companies were integrated into the sector\u2019s managerial group \n\nUNESA. Furthermore, there were some small distribution companies that acquired electricity by \n\nUNESA companies and resold it to the consumers. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n7 UNESA is a utility association that has traditionally played a substantial role in coordinating the \n\nactivities of the utilities, including coordinated planning, negotiation of fuel purchases with suppliers, \n\nanalysis of economic and financial issues, and research and development. It has represented the utilities \n\nbefore national bodies such as the CNSE. Liberalisation of the electricity market required the utilities to \n\nundertake commercial activities such as fuel purchasing separately. Due to such changes UNESA has \n\nbeen required to redefine its activities and change from a corporation to a non-profit association with the \n\npotential for much broader membership [54]. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n84 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 58. Main features of the pre Spanish liberalisation \n\n \n\nThe first step towards the liberalisation of the Spanish electricity market was made in 1997 with \n\nthe approval of the Spanish Electric Power Act 54/19978 [55]. After a decade of reforms, this \n\nfirst document provided the basis for the creation of an open wholesale market, the choice of \n\nsuppliers to the largest electricity customers and mandated price decreases to those remaining \n\nunder regulated tariffs.  \n\nDuring the two following years, further legislation amendments and Royal Decrees have \n\nwidened the choice more quickly to medium-sized consumers, cut regulated prices more deeply \n\nthan originally planned, and encourage greater activity in the wholesale market by lowering \n\naccess tariffs [54]. \n\n \n\nDespite the Act 54/1997 established the legal separation between the regulated activities \n\n(transmission and distribution) and the liberalised activities (generation and supply), given the \n\nfact that they are natural monopolies, the document kept the possibility to integrate these \n\nactivities in the same group enterprise [54].  \n\n                                                      \n8 The Act 54/1997 establishes the basic legal framework for generation, transmission, distribution, and \n\nsale of electricity. It left behind the public service system approach and provided the basis for the \n\nliberalisation or privatisation of the Spanish electricity sector [54]. \n\nSupply\n\nEndesa Iberdrola Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Hidrocant\u00e1brico\nSmall \n\ndistribution \ncompanies\n\nDistribution\n\nEndesa Iberdrola Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Hidrocant\u00e1brico\n\nTransmission\n\nREE\n\nGeneration\n\nEndesa Iberdrola Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Hidrocant\u00e1brico Self generation\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n85 \n\n \n\nThrough this new framework, the regulated activities allowed the regulated TPA to the \n\nnetworks, under the conditions established in the regulation and through the payment of an \n\naccess tariff. \n\n \n\nRoyal Decree-Law 17/2007 modified the previous Act to the stipulations of Second Directive on \n\ncommon rules for the IEM. For instance, the document introduced the functional and accounting \n\nseparation of regulated activities.  \n\nTwo years later, through the Royal Decree-Law 485/2009, it was introduced measures regarding \n\nthe protection of vulnerable customers, protection of consumers\u2019 fundamental rights and \n\npromotion of economic and social cohesion, such as the last resort supply concept and the \n\nadditive calculation mechanism used to set last resort tariffs based on the cost of energy, the \n\naccess tariff and an additional cost for commercial management [51].  \n\n \n\nThe latest significant amendment to the original document was done two years ago, through the \n\nRoyal Decree-Law 13/2012. With this new framework, it was granted new powers and \n\nreinforced duties to CNE on unbundling, consumers\u2019 protection and the approval of \n\nmethodologies concerning transmission and distribution access tariffs in order to create a single \n\nregulatory authority at national level. Moreover, the document introduced new measures \n\nregarding the supply activity (vulnerable consumer concept and requirements), appointment and \n\ncertification of TSO and effective separation of the four activities (FOU) [51]. \n\n \n\nSince 1998, Spain has a fully competitive generation market. Although in the beginning the four \n\nlargest generation companies represented more than 85% of the total Spanish production, with \n\nentry of new competitors this share has reduced gradually. \n\nIberdrola, Uni\u00f3n Fenosa and Hidrocant\u00e1brico were originally privately owned companies. \n\nEndesa become also private, when in 1998 the government\u2019s remaining shares were sold. \n\nHowever, the government retained Golden Shares until 2005. \n\nAll generators are entitled to have access to transmission and distribution networks through an \n\nauthorisation procedure [54]. However, there is another type of generation regime: the special \n\none, which is also granted, through an authorisation, to generators with production of equal or \n\nless than 50 MW, self-generators using cogeneration or other forms of electricity generation \n\nassociated to RES.  \n\n \n\nIn order to provide more competition to the sector, at the same time it was also created an \n\nwholesale electricity market: MIBEL (formerly OMEL). Basically, this organised market, that \n\nwill be later discussed, allowed generating companies to compete and sell their electricity in a \n\ncentralised pool and/or through bilateral contracts with buyers. \n\n \n\nRegarding the transmission activity, in early 1999 the government controlled 60% of REE and \n\neach of the four main companies held 10%, the maximum permissible share of total capital per \n\nindividual owner. Some months after, the government announced its plan to sell a share of 35% \n\nto small shareholders and institutional and foreign investors.  \n\nIn 2007, the Royal Decree-Law 17/2007 established the single-carrier model with REE as the \n\nowner of entire transmission network, including the technical and financial management of the \n\nsystem [56]. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n86 \n\n \n\nDistribution activity occurs through the utilities operating under a concession granted by the \n\nautonomous regional authorities or the national government, in the case of distributors serving \n\nmore than one autonomous community.  \n\nThe Cooperative model is well disseminated across Spain. Thus, besides the main companies, \n\ncurrently there are also a number of independent small DSO across the country. Until 2009, they \n\nalso sold electricity to customers. \n\n \n\nThe Spanish supply activity took almost 10 years to become fully open to competition. It all \n\nstarted in 1998 with largest customers and was extended to domestic customers in 2003. Despite \n\nthe several timetables, at the end all high-voltage consumers (using supply above 1 kW) were \n\neligible to choose supplier from 1 July 2000. All other customers were scheduled to be able to \n\nchoose suppliers in 2003 [54]. \n\nNowadays, new companies can also enter the retail supply of electricity to liberalised customers \n\nunder authorisation from the appropriate level of government. Approval of the autonomous \n\ncommunity government is required for regional/local retailing. \n\n \n\nBesides CNSE, the independent regulatory commission established in 1994, whose main \n\nfunctions are advisory and dispute-related resolution, approval of mergers and acquisition into \n\ntransmission and distribution companies, two new entity were created [56]:  \n\n \n\n? The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism (MIET): assumes policy \nresponsibilities for the reforms and it also has the most significant regulatory functions. \n\nIn particular, it is responsible for setting regulated retail tariffs, network access tariffs \n\nand various charges. Moreover, it authorises new generators and approves transmission \n\nprojects. \n\n? The National Commission for Energy (CNE): took over the responsibilities for the \nenergy sector and the hydrocarbon fuels. Nowadays, the role and functions of this \n\nregulatory authority were transferred to National Commission for Markets and \n\nCompetition (CNMC), a new entity that was established in 2013. The new authority \n\nmerges the competition body with several sectorial regulators (energy, \n\ntelecommunications, audio-visual, transport and postal), with the aim of guaranteeing, \n\npreserving and fostering the correct operation, transparency and effective competition in \n\nall sectors and markets. \n\n \n\nMoreover, autonomous communities have competencies in several areas, including the approval \n\nof  \n\ndistribution facilities and other electric facilities \u201cwhen their use does not affect other regions\u201d \n\n(for instance, small generation facilities), the concession rights for electricity distribution, and \n\ndevelopment of regulations with respect to connection of supply, and the enforcement of \n\nregulations with respect to quality of service.  \n\nThe autonomous communities also play an important role in supporting the development of \n\nindependent generation, and have the right to put additional charges on the bills of electricity \n\ncustomers in their region to recover the costs of such support. \n\n \n\nAll the previous information can be summarised in Figure 59. As a consequence of such \n\nmeasures, nowadays the Spanish electricity system can be represented through Figure 60.   \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n87 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 59.

Nevertheless, there \n\nare some other companies, whose market share is registering a significant growing. Companies \n\nsuch as Fersa, Zabalgarbi, Alpic Energ\u00eda Espa\u00f1a, Gorona de Viento, GDF Suez, ENEL Green \n\nPower Espa\u00f1a, Torresol Energy, Eolia, Anselmo Le\u00f3n, Barbo Energ\u00edas Renovables, Acciona or \n\nCooperatives, as Som Energia, Enercoop and GoiEner, are taking advantage of the European \n\nDirectives and recent RES policies to increase their significance in the Spanish energy market \n\n[57].   \n\n  \n\nWhilst there is only one TSO in Spain, REE, the DSOs are usually commercial companies or \n\nCooperatives. Currently, there are more than 300 distribution companies operating in Spain, \n\nincluding for instance the 5 largest energy companies in Spain, Agri-Energia, Aguas de \n\nBarbastro Energ\u00eda, Bassols Energia, Berruerza, Central Electrica Mitjans, Compa\u00f1ia de \n\nElectricidad del Condado, Dielenor, Dielesur, Alarcon Navarro Empresa Electrica, Alset \n\nElectrica, Anselmo Leon Distribucion, among many others [57]. \n\n \n\nAlthough Spain has more than 160 active electricity suppliers at present, the most important are \n\nthose that are obliged to supply the vulnerable customers: Endesa, Iberdrola, Gas Natural \n\nFenosa, EDP/Hidrocant\u00e1brico Energ\u00eda and E.ON.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 61. Evolution of the number of suppliers with a significant volume of customers in the distribution \n\nareas of the five largest players [58] \n\n \n\nAs shown in the Figure 61, the suppliers that are not related to the 5 traditional energy \n\ncompanies are progressively increasing their share in the free market. According to CNMC\u2019s \n\nreport [58], in 2013, the companies with the highest growth in relative terms in the domestic \n\nsegment were Fenie Energ\u00eda, Som Energia, Audax Energ\u00eda, Watium, HolaLuz and Gesternova, \n\nwhich are suppliers with no links to any distribution areas.   \n\nIn the end of 2013, the retail market had a switching rate of 12%, one of the highest in Europe, \n\nwhich means the Spanish customer is more aware than in the past of the options available in the \n\nmarket. There are several reasons that may be linked to this high switching rate and the slowly \n\nincrease of small companies\u2019 influence, as the prices billed, consumer dissatisfaction and the \n\nrising awareness for a new energetic paradigm. Other possible reason is the fact that the \n\nregulated tariffs are coming to the end, forcing then the consumer to move to the liberalised \n\nmarket and choose one of the several suppliers operating in the country. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n89 \n\n \n\nIn spite of this advances, in December 2013 the 5 largest supplier companies still registered \n\nalmost 80% of the total volume of energy supplied in the free market (Figure 62), 97% if \n\nconsider only the domestic sector. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 62. Evolution of the market share, by company [58] \n\n \n\nBesides Som Energia, there are others Cooperatives actives in the retail market, such as \n\nGoiEner, Nosa Enerx\u00eda S.C.G or Zencer, which also provides green electricity to domestic end-\n\nusers, trying then to push the world into a better energetic paradigm. \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Som Energia \n\n \n\n \n\nIn Spain, the object of study chosen for this work is the Som Energia, which have been \n\noperating in the country for exactly four years. Looking back at the history of Som Energia, or \n\n\u201cWe are Energy\u201d translated to English, the idea of creating a company that promotes the RES \n\nand the sustainable development just came up in 2010, when a group of people linked to the \n\nUniversity of Girona decided to reproduce the formula of success established in other European \n\ncountries, in promoting a new electricity model more citizen-friendly. Under this concept was \n\nborn the Som Energia,  the first renewable energy cooperative in Catalonia and the reality has \n\nbeen showing the positive impact that this movement is operating, not only in the region, but in \n\nthe whole Spain [59].  \n\n \n\nAlthough the idea was created in the beginning of 2010, only in the end of the same year the \n\nproject is extended to a cooperative model. Right after this event, in September of 2011, they \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n90 \n\n \n\nstarted to provide electricity, based on green energy, and one month later it was built the \n\nconstruction of its first RES power plants.  \n\nBesides the main activities (production and supply), it is also Som Energia\u2019 intentions to fight \n\nthe unemployment, through the promotion of green jobs in the local communities where the \n\nfuture projects will be installed, and to disseminate a new energy culture in Spain. Nowadays, \n\nSom Energia also promotes measures for energy saving among their members.  \n\n \n\nMoreover, and under the promoting of a new energy paradigm, the Cooperative aims to \n\nintroduce an educational and mentality shift [60].  \n\nThus, Som Energia does not want to be just a provider or producer of green energy. The \n\nambition of this cooperative is above all, to build a wide social movement supporting RES and \n\nthe public participation. According to its mission, the human component is very important for \n\nthe success of this project and at the moment, the huge level of commitment of its members has \n\nbeen helping to build a community\u2019s awareness for real alternatives. \n\n    \n\nResuming the four years of activities, the first year was, mainly, focused on the launch of the \n\nCooperative. When this period was overcome, it was second year\u2019s intention to start selling \n\ngreen electricity to all partners and producing its own energy. Since last year (2013), the \n\nexpectations are: \n\n \n\n? To consolidate the Cooperative\u2019s grow in terms of the evolution within the Spanish \nelectricity market; \n\n? To consolidate the Som Energia electricity price; \n? To reduce the production costs for continuous technological improvements; \n? Development of policies to reduce emissions taxes. \n\n \n\nRegarding to its members, since its foundation the number of members of the Cooperative has \n\ngrown from year to year. The journey of Som Energia started with 350 members and one year \n\nlater, end of 2011, the number surpassed the mark of 1000 members. The growth of Som \n\nEnergia has been remarkable, and at the moment, past two years, the Cooperative has nearly 16 \n\n000 members mainly due to the ability of its members to be supplied by 100% renewable \n\nelectricity, at a similar price to last resort electricity supplier, regardless of their place of \n\nresidence. \n\n \n\nUnlike The Co-operative Energy, until very recently in Som Energia it was mandatory a \n\ncustomer be also a member of the Cooperative. Nevertheless, a person who wants to become a \n\nmember shall pay a one-off returnable deposit of \u20ac 100 in the Cooperative's social capital.  \n\nIn some countries, the Cooperative\u00b4s activities are subsidised by the government, lottery funds \n\nor other private foundations. However, in Spain, this kind of incentive is not available, and does \n\nnot seems to be in the near future, especially because of the current climate of crisis and \n\nausterity budgets that the country is facing [61]. That\u2019s why is so important for Som Energia, \n\nthat each customer be a member as well, and understands the concept behind the Cooperative. \n\nAnother difference, comparing to The Co-operative Energy, is that Som Energia does not follow \n\nthe traditional advertising. It is all based on social networks (Twitter or Facebook), instead of \n\nthe British Cooperative, that besides these plataforms, already used for the first time the radio as \n\na way to spread its campaigns. Nevertheless, the mouth to mouth dissemination is used by all \n\nCooperatives. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n91 \n\n \n\n \n\nOnce a member, the citizen can invest in new RES projects (investors can get a return of \n\nbetween 3-5% annually and can take out their investment whenever they wish). These projects \n\nare mainly small-scale projects (owned by all members) to produce energy in the biogas, PV, \n\nwind and biomass sectors. With these projects, it is Som Energia objective to be able to cover \n\nfully the energy demands of its members.  \n\nMoreover, in Som Energia, all members can take part in the cooperative working groups \n\n(commercialisation, diffusion, projects, education, among others) and also be active in the \n\nseveral volunteer regional centres distributed all around the country [62].  \n\nAnother way to call for its member participation, are through the conferences, debates and \n\nregular meetings around the country that the Cooperative organises, to engage and raise \n\nawareness about sustainable energy.  \n\n \n\nAs all other Cooperatives, here the cooperative system is also meant to let all members \n\nparticipate and it functions under the principle of one person, one vote.  \n\n \n\n4.4.

Basically, the district can be seen as an intermediate level of administration \n\nbetween the Bundesl\u00e4nder and the municipal governments (Gemeinden), which are the lowest \n\nlevel of official territorial division in Germany.  \n\n \n\nAt this point, and without further details, it is possible to see that Germany has a quite \n\ncomplicated organisational system. However, despite the constitutional system complexity, the \n\ncountry has always adopted the internal European electricity market directives on time.  \n\n \n\nThus, the beginning of the German liberalisation process was given in end of the last century, \n\nwith the ratification of The National Energy Act of 1998. Basically, this document transposed \n\nthe First Directive at the federal level. When the Second Directive came up, in 2003, all the EU \n\nmembers were obligated to adopt the guidelines published in the document. Germany was no \n\ndifferent, and in 2005 it was enacted a new National Energy Act, that was later amended in 2011 \n\nwith the release of the Third Directive two years before [63].  \n\n \n\nBefore the liberalisation, the electricity sector in Germany was organised by a coexistence of \n\npublic,  \n\nprivate and mixed-economy enterprises, which means there was never a broad government \n\nmonopoly in the sector as practised, for instance, in the UK with the former CEGB. Here, \n\ninstead, the regulation framework as a natural monopoly hence competition was not tolerated \n\n[63]. But how is that? \n\n \n\nTo understand how the German electricity sector used to work on that period, it is necessary to \n\ngo back to the time of the First World War. When the war ended it was adopted a system of \n\nterritorial monopolies. Distribution areas were established by demarcation contracts between \n\nenergy supply companies. In this way, the energy supply companies can only operate inside \n\ntheir own contractual territories. Later, the system was strengthened when energy supply \n\ncompanies started cooperation with municipal utilities [63].  \n\nMunicipal utilities in ownership of the municipals received electricity, from that one produced \n\nby the energy supply company in which they were involved and in doing so, assured the \n\nmarketing of the electricity producing energy supply company. In the meantime the \n\nmunicipalities participated via the profits of the larger energy supply companies.

The supra-regional level: In 1997 there were 8 NESCs, which produced almost 80% \nof the country electricity. Moreover, they had been active only in the framework of their \n\nterritorial monopoly. However, whilst some companies (PreussenElektra AG, \n\nBayerwerk AG, VEAG) were only active in production and transmission, others NESCs, \n\nsuch as RWE, VEW, EnBW, BEWAG and HEW had been active in all the four electricity \n\nsectors. \n\n? The regional level: At this level, there were around 80 RESCs with a production share \nof 10%, total took over the electricity from the large NESCs. The RESCs distributed \n\nelectricity whether to end-users or to MUs. \n\n? The municipal level: There were around 900 MUs supplied end-users in their \nmunicipalities with electricity, gas, water or district heat. They produced an electricity \n\nshare similar to RESCs.  \n\n \n\nAll energy supply companies were linked via long-term contracts, typically for 20 years. \n\nAdditionally, as a result of capital investments large NESCs financed their subsidiary RESCs. In \n\ncontrast to the RESCs, MUs remained autonomous and were minority capital owners of the \n\nlarge NESCs [63].  \n\n \n\nThereby, before the liberalisation, and in the framework of the territorial monopoly concept, all \n\nthe four activities were clearly in the hands of the large NESCs (Figure 64). The MUs \n\nparticipated in the profits of the NESCs by capital shares. Indeed, the supply to the customers \n\nwas organised mainly by MUs, but the electricity sold to them came from NESCs, delivered \n\nfrom the RESCs, and MUs in approximately equal quantities [63]. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n94 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 64. Main features of the pre German liberalisation \n\n \n\nThe post liberalisation of the German electricity sector started with the adoption of The National \n\nEnergy Act of 1998\n9\n (\u201cEnergiewirtschaftsgesetz von 1998\u201d). According to the document, legal \n\ncompetition became possible, which means territorial monopolies were abolished. It was only \n\nenacted the separation of accounts between the transmission activities and production and \n\nsupply. Moreover, it was guaranteed a negotiated TPA to the electricity transport system for \n\nelectricity producers and industrial consumers (Germany was the only EU member to adopt this \n\noption, instead of regulated access), without any regulatory agency supervision. In fact, the \n\nregulation of the electricity networks was given over to the NESCs.  \n\nHowever, the complete and seamless liberalisation process did not lead to competition, but to \n\nproceedings and market concentration due to mergers and acquisitions [63]. \n\n \n\nWhile the document expected to be approved and adopted, the large NESCs reacted with a \n\nmassive wave of mergers, in order to keep market power, profits and electricity prices as they \n\nwanted. Thus, the merger process started in 1997 with the merger between Badenwerk and \n\nEnergieversorgung Schwaben (EVS) to the new NESC, called Energie Baden-W\u00fcrtemberg AG \n\n(EnBW) and continued later at national and European level.  \n\nFundamentally, this very early merger process and in particular the seamless liberalisation in \n\nGermany, due to The National Energy Act of 1998, are indications of the influence of large \n\nGerman NESCs within German legislation in accordance with their own expansive market \n\nstrategies [63]. \n\n \n\nIn 2005, the negotiated TPA was transformed to a regulatory TPA with the release of the new \n\nNational Energy Act. It was also stated in the document, that regulatory entities shall be created \n\n                                                      \n9 According to Energiewirtschaftsgesetz von 1998, the purpose of the Act was to ensure the safe, \n\naffordable and environmentally acceptable wireline supply of electricity and gas in the public interest. \n\nBasically, the document approached topics, such as abolition of antitrust exemptions for the energy \n\nsector, control of prices and conditions, grid access and power transmission and the promotion of RES, in \n\norder to deal with a new general structure of the German electricity market [64]. \n\nSupply\n\n5 NESC 80 RESC 900 MU\n\nDistribution\n\n80 RESC 900 MU\n\nTransmission\n\n8 NESC\n\nGeneration\n\n8 NESC 80 RESC 900 MU\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n95 \n\n \n\nand responsible for the legal unbundling of non-competitive areas (transmission and \n\ndistribution) from competitive areas (production and supply) [63]. \n\n \n\nWith the publishing of the Third Directive in 2009, EU members were invited to adopt more \n\ncommon rules. Thus, until March 2011 Germany had to applicate effective unbundling of \n\nenergy production and supply interests from the network, through three basic models, increase \n\nthe transparency of retail markets and introduce more effective regulatory oversight, among \n\nothers. The main features of the post German liberalisation are represented in Figure 65. \n\n  \n\nIn the generation activity, in 2005 there was a reduction of the number of NESCs from 8 to 4 \n\n(REW, E.ON, EnBW and Vanttenfall). Despite, on that period, their electricity market share \n\nincreased, the scenario have been changing with the decommissioning of several nuclear power \n\nplants, owned by these companies, and the significant expansion of capacity from RES [65].  \n\nThe electricity generation market is no longer controlled by the big 4 companies. Nowadays, \n\napart from a few other large-generating companies, the electricity generating market consists of \n\na large number of independent companies, most importantly public utility companies, that have \n\nbeen taking advantage of the RES\u2019 government support schemes to slowly enter in the market \n\n[66]. All players need an authorisation to build new electricity generation power plants. \n\n \n\nSince 2005, the 4 big generating companies are responsible for the transmission networks and \n\nall are generally obligated to connect power plants on an economically reasonable, non-\n\ndiscriminatory and transparent basis. When the Third Directive was transposed at a federal \n\nlevel, they had to choose among three main unbundling models: FOU, ITO and ISO [67].  \n\nThey opted for different models of unbundling. For instance, E.ON and Vanttenfall opted for a \n\nFOU model. As a consequence, these companies would have to sell their electricity networks, \n\nleading then to two new TSOs: TenneT (ex-E.ON) and 50Hertz Transmission ( formerly \n\nVanttenfal). On the opposite, Amprion (RWE) and TransnetBW (EnBW) opted for a ITO model. \n\nThat means, that under this model the management of the transmission network is done by \n\na subsidiary of the parent company.  \n\nFinally, an operating permit by the state regulatory authority and certification by BNetzA are \n\nrequired to operate a transmission network.    \n\n \n\nCharacterising the distribution sector, since 2005 the electricity distribution activity are fully \n\nregulated. While the big 4 companies have managed to acquire shares in many DSOs, whether \n\nRESCs or MUs, through privatisation efforts in the past, the German distribution market has \n\nseen a reverse trend in recent years [66].  \n\nIn order to provide competition and to ensure the success of the German liberalisation process, \n\nthe BKartA prevented new acquisitions by the 4 NESCs. Nevertheless, the most significant \n\n\u201cmeasure\u201d that have been shifting the sector is the will of the local people, which through social \n\nmovements such as Cooperatives are attempting to regain sole control over the DSOs. The most \n\nfamous case is EWS, a small Cooperative that besides producing energy based on RES, also \n\ndistributes the energy produced through the networks it owns. \n\nThus, currently the German DSOs are mainly small local entities, largely owned by \n\nmunicipalities [68]. The requirements to operate distribution systems in Germany are equivalent \n\nto those for transmission systems with the exception that DSOs do not need to be certified by \n\nthe BNetzA. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n96 \n\n \n\nWith the introduction of The National Energy Act of 1998, the supply activity was straight away \n\nopened up to competition. Thus, from then on the German customer was able to switch from \n\nelectricity supplier, despite electricity end-user prices for households were regulated until 1 July \n\n2007.  \n\nAt the moment, any company which aims to be also an electricity supplier, must comply with \n\nthe guidelines on business processes for the supply of electricity to customers \n\n(Gesch\u00e4ftsprozesse zur Kundenbelieferung mit Elektrizit\u00e4t (GPKE)) published in 2006. \n\nSince the beginning of the liberalisation efforts in 1998, at least one-third of customers had \n\nchanged electricity supplier. In 2014 this ratio is expected to rise to some 40% or 50%. \n\nRenewable energy suppliers are particularly benefiting from this trend [66]. \n\n \n\nConcerning the regulation, the amendment of 2005 separated the regulation of the transport \n\nsegment and the competition segments (retail and supply of electricity). \n\nThus, in order to ensure the correct functioning of the German electricity system, there were \n\ncreated several regulatory agencies [63][66]: \n\n \n\n? The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA)). This regulatory \nauthority is the system responsible for the transport segment, inclunding TSOs, and to \n\ncreate the conditions for fair and effective competition on the upstream and downstream \n\nmarkets for the supply of electricity. Moreover, until 2007 Bundesnetzagentur was also \n\nresponsible to regulate the authorisations concerning net entering and the cost based of \n\nnet prices, plus unbundlings.  \n\n? State Regulatory Authorities (Landesregulierungsbeh\u00f6rden). This new entities were \nresponsible in the same way as the BNetzA concerning electricity transport companies \n\nwith less than 100 000 customers and if their network is within the borders of the \n\nrespective federal state.  \n\n \n\nFundamentally, these are the two institutions responsible for the regulation of the electricity \n\ngrids. \n\n \n\nFurthermore, there were created some other entities such as the Federal Cartel Office \n\n(Bundeskartellamt (BKartA)) responsible for merger control and protection of competition. \n\nMoreover, it is responsible for the operation of another regulatory authority, Market \n\nTransparency Authority for Electricity and Gas (Markttransparenzstelle Strom und Gas \n\n(MTS)), in cooperation with the BNetzA. Then, there are the Federal Environment Agency \n\n(Umweltbundesamt (UBA)), competent for environmental issues and it includes the German \n\nEmission Trading Authority (Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle (DEHSt)), which governs the \n\ntrading of emission certificates under the Kyoto Protocol [66]. \n\n \n\nFinally, and to help the liberalisation process, it was established two electricity exchanges \n\nmarkets in 2000: Leipzig Power Exchange - LPX and European Power Exchange - EPX. In \n\n2002, LPX and EPX merged and founded a new organised energy market called European \n\nEnergy Exchange (EEX) covering the spot market, the futures market and the clearing of OTC \n\ndealings (bilateral contracts).With EEX it was introduced more prices transparency, as well as \n\nmarket competition. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n97 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 65.

Despite the historical powerful \n\ncompanies such as RWE, E.ON, EnBW and Vanttenfal, there are several other firms that are \n\ntaking advantage of the RES to increase their generation market share, such as Enercon, \n\nEnertrag, GDF Suez, swb AG, Breeze Two Energy, EEW Energy from Waste, MVV Energie, \n\nEnergiekontor, Prokon, ENERTRAG, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Electrique de l'Our, Envia Therm, EWE AG, \n\nRheinEnergie, STEAG and Mainova, among others. Besides these large generating companies, \n\nthere are the public utility companies (Stadtwerke Bochum Holding GmbH, Stadtwerke \n\nBrandenburg an der Havel GmbH, Stadtwerke D\u00fcsseldorf AG, Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen GmbH, \n\nStadtwerke Hannover AG, Stadtwerke Leipzig GmbH or Stadtwerke Flensburg GmbH). All \n\nthese companies, and many others, have power plants with over 10 MW of installed capacity \n\n[69]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 67. TSOs operating in Germany [70] \n\n \n\nAt the moment, there are 4 TSOs operating in the country (Figure 67): 50Hertz Transmission, \n\nAmprion, TenneT and TransnetBW, each of them responsible for one of the four German control \n\nareas. Fundamentally, their task is to keep control power available to maintain stable and \n\nreliable supply.  \n\n \n\nIn the distribution activity, currently there are almost 900 electricity distribution companies \n\nactive in the market. The majority are small regional DSOs, called Stadwerke, with fewer than \n\n100 000 customers [69]. Three quarters of all DSOs in Germany supply fewer than 30 000 \n\nhouseholds, which means that they all have a small market share.  \n\nThere is in Germany an innovative partnerships between communities, public and private \n\norganisations, which have enabled localities to take ownership of or participate in the \n\ngovernance of their local energy systems and utilities - a phenomenon that has grown \n\nsignificantly in recent years.  Thus, driven by the success history of EWS in the past, by the end \n\nof 2012, 190 German communities had been successful in bidding to run their local electricity \n\ndistribution grid, with at least nine of these being fully owned by EWS. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n99 \n\n \n\nFinally, in relation to supply, at the moment there are more than 1100 electricity suppliers \n\noperating in Germany, mostly Stadtwerke due to their public service obligation of electricity \n\nsupply. These utilities have long or medium term delivery contracts with the major electricity \n\nproducers.  \n\nBy other words, it is possible to say the Stadtwerke are traditionally responsible for operating \n\nthe local grid networks and distributing energy to local consumers, and therefore have a greater \n\nand more central role in the governance of their local energy market. Nevertheless, it is to be \n\nnoted that the share of public utilies in overall supply in the electricity sector has continuously \n\ndecreased since 1998 due to the incoming of new suppliers and contract switching. \n\n \n\nThese new electricity suppliers can be divided in two types: those, whose energy comes fully \n\nfrom RES, and those who use conventional energy sources.   \n\nSlowly, the supply companies are spreading their business across the country. Whilst, in 2008, \n\nthe majority of suppliers operated only within one network area, or in maximally four additional \n\nnetwork areas, nowadays new electricity suppliers operate, on average, within 200 network \n\nareas, leading then to a number of approximately 72 suppliers for household customers within \n\neach network. On the opposite, established public utilities are active, on average, within 31 \n\nnetwork areas [65].    \n\n \n\nWhile in 2008 the share of the four largest electricity suppliers (E.ON, RWE, EnBW and \n\nVattenfall) in the overall household customer segment was still at 50.1%, in 2010, the year \n\nunder review, this share was at 43.8%, and the tendency in the near future is the rate to keep \n\nfalling. It is clear to say, the Stadtwerke and other independent suppliers represent more than \n\n50% of the domestic market. The reasons are transversal to other European energy markets. \n\nAmong the main causes, it is possible to highlight the environmental concerns, the will of \n\nchange for a new \u201cgreen\u201d world, the lack of trust in the big energy companies and the prices \n\nbilled. \n\nHowever, the people\u2019s desire for a decentralised power is the main reason. Since the early \n\nnineties, there have been in Germany, a clear movement towards a much more constructive, \n\nlocally-governed infrastructure in which communities may secure their participation and ensure \n\ntransparency, efficiency and the betterment of their neighbourhoods, which soon led to the \n\ncreation of new community companies, as Cooperatives.  \n\nNowadays, the influence of these social companies is rising over the years, once they serve and \n\nsupport the local community and economy. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the retail \n\nmarket in the German electricity sector is characterised by a strongly regional structure.  \n\n \n\n4.4.3. EWS \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n100 \n\n \n\nThe number of RES Cooperatives in Germany has been growing significantly in recent years, \n\nregistering 100 new cases each year. For instance, at the end of 2013, there were 888 registered \n\nRES Cooperatives in the country. \n\nAmong the almost 900 social enterprises, it is possible to find one of the pioneers of RES \n\nmovement: Elektrizit\u00e4tsWerke Sch\u00f6nau (EWS). Its roots are traced in the eighties, right after the \n\nChernobyl disaster in 1986, when in the small town of Sch\u00f6nau, a small group\u2019 initiative \n\nemerged to protest against nuclear energy and promoting alternative ways of energy supply. \n\nThus, after many years of protests and debates with the local grid operators and the town \n\ncouncil, the EWS in 1997 succeeded in buying the grid from the former electricity supplier for \n\n4.7 million Deutsche Mark [61]. The financing of such high amount of money was only possible \n\nby a spectacular country wide appeal for funds, which did not only made the purchase possible \n\nbut also showed that when the citizens join together it is possible to achieve good things.  \n\n \n\nThe process was intense and slow, but after many years of struggle EWS could then legally run \n\nthe electricity network of Sch\u00f6nau, and reorganise it in an ecological manner.  \n\nInitially, EWS started to supply Sch\u00f6nau\u2019s community\u2019s, through local RES sources, however \n\nwhen the energy market was liberalised, the Cooperative spread its services to households \n\nacross Germany [71].  \n\n \n\nRegarding its creation, EWS was formed in 1994, as a natural evolution of Netzkauf GbR, a \n\ncitizen group established in 1991, whose plan was to buy the electricity grid themselves. \n\nNowadays, EWS is one of the largest eco-electricity providers in Europe, and the largest run by \n\ncitizens. Its aim is simple: to decentralise and democratise the energy supply, putting it at the \n\nnucleus of a continuously expanding national network of independent power generators utilising \n\na range of RES technologies (PV, hydropower, wind power, biomass and cogeneration). \n\n \n\nAfter this first success, EWS expanded and during the following years, grids in nine \n\nneighbouring villages were bought as well. It allowed EWS to increase the number of \n\ncustomers, reaching in the moment to around 150 000 households, commercial establishments \n\nand industrial firms with green electricity, comparing to the 1 700 customers in the beginning. \n\nSince the beginning, the EWS\u2019s business model and work has repeatedly garnered prizes. It has \n\nbeen leading to a satisfaction not only among members and workers of EWS, but the customers \n\nare also happy to see that they are contributing to EWS\u2019s vision of sustainable and fair power \n\nproduction [72].  \n\n \n\nRegarding membership, EWS Cooperative gathers 3 400 members. To become a member, a \n\nperson must purchase at least five shares, with the value of \u20ac 100 each, and the money will be \n\nused for the expansion of its grid networks and the establishment of independent RES power \n\nplants, through EWS Energie GmbH. A side note to say that, it is not mandatory a new \n\ncustomer become a member too.  \n\n \n\nIn this moment a pertinent question may arise: Why the number of members is smaller when \n\ncompared to customers? Well, despite its longevity, EWS is only registered as a Cooperative \n\nsince end of 2009 [72]: EWS Netzkauf eG.  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n101 \n\n \n\nAs a Cooperative, EWS must face new problems regarding to energy market. In Germany there \n\nare more than 900 grid operators, also very small ones, like EWS Netze GmbH. For years EU \n\nhas been telling Germany to minimize the number of grid operators, and what it possible to see \n\ntoday is a closing in on grid operators more and more by the German regulation agency, the \n\nBNetzA. \n\nAs a consequence, many small grid operators are giving up, because from a financial \n\nperspective they are unable to fulfil these requirements [61].  \n\nWill EWS survive to this change in the energy market? Only time may tell. \n\n \n\n4.5. Electricity Sector in Belgium \n\n4.5.1. An Overview of the Belgian Liberalised Market \n\n \n\nFigure 68. Belgium and its Regions \n\n \n\nBefore any further development about the Belgian liberalisation, it is important to clarify that \n\nthe Kingdom of Belgium is a federation of three Regions with three national languages, of \n\nwhich Dutch and French are predominant (Figure 68): \n\n \n\n? The Flanders, in the north of the country, is subdivided into five provinces and include \nmany medieval art cities such as Antwerp, Bruges or Ghent; \n\n? The Wallonia, in the south, whose main cities are Liege, Namur and Charleroi, is also \nsubdivided into five provinces; \n\n? And the Brussels-Capital Region, which does not contain any province. Basically, is \nonly the capital.   \n\n \n\n Among the five countries that will be object of study in this work, the Belgian government was \n\nthe one that took more time to liberalise the electricity sector, maybe because of such a complex \n\npolitical power, with competencies regarding energy policy, divided between the federal level \n\nand the three Regions.  \n\nIn fact, the start sign for the liberalisation process was given in 1999, one year after the deadline \n\nset by EC, with the transposition of First Directive at the federal level, but only two years later, \n\nin 2001, the law of 1999 was further completed and amended by all the Regions between 2000 \n\nand 2004 [73].  \n\nRegarding the remaining two European Directives, just like the first one, they were transposed \n\nto federal law out of time. For instance, while the Second Directive was transposed into Belgian \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n102 \n\n \n\nlaw in middle of 2005 [74], the Third Directive has taken place at federal level by 2012, despite \n\nthe deadline of March 2011 [75].   \n\nWith the timeline of the Belgian liberalisation done, it is time to give the big picture of pre \n\nliberalisation of the Belgian electricity system (Figure 69). \n\n \n\nThus, before 1999 the Belgian generation sector was dominated by Electrabel and the SPE with \n\nmarket shares of 91% and 6.5%, respectively. The rest of the market share was divided over a \n\nnumber of small autonomous producers and industrial auto producers. \n\nBoth companies also operated the transmission networks through a joint cooperation, called \n\nCPTE. Through this entity, created in 1995, Electrabel and SPE coordinated and managed their \n\nactivities in both the segment of generation and transmission [73].   \n\n \n\nRegarding to the distribution activity, the networks were, initally, propriety of the \n\nmunicipalities, which meant they had a legal monopoly for the distribution of electricity. \n\nHowever, most municipalities transferred the distribution of energy to inter-municipal \n\ncompanies, set up by groups of municipalities (, or intercommunales). There were two types of \n\nintercommunales:  \n\n \n\n? Pure intercommunales, this means pure public ownership; \n? Mixed intercommunales, in which municipalities joined forces with a private company \n\nto organise distribution management and investment activities.  \n\n \n\nThe private company working in association with the municipalities was Electrabel, which \n\nparticipated for approximately 60%. By other words, the inter-municipal companies were tied \n\nby agreements to purchase electricity from Electrabel for a period of 15 years. This meant that \n\nElectrabel was not only the big player in generation and transmission activities, but also had a \n\ndominant position in the distribution sector [73]. \n\n \n\nJust like distribution, the supply activity was also in hands of municipal and pure \n\nintercommunales companies with shares of 1 % and 12 %, respectively. Concerning the mixed \n\nintercommunales companies the share was of 49 %. Nevertheless, Electrabel and SPE, through \n\nCPTE, were responsible for the electricity supply to clients directly connected to the \n\ntransmission network (38 %) [73].  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 69. Main features of the pre Belgian liberalisation \n\n \n\nThe post liberalisation era brought some changes in the four sectors (Figure 70). For instance, \n\nstarting by generation, it was established that electricity generators need to have an authorisation \n\nbefore they can start their activities. Nowadays, the generation sector is full liberalised which \n\nmeans, besides the two historical major players, Electrabel (GdF-Suez) and SPE-Luminus, a  \n\nfew new companies entered in the generation activity, like REW, E.ON, EDF, Enoco, Eni and \n\nEssent, or some smaller companies such as Aspiravi, Ecopower, Electrabel Green Projects \n\nFlanders and Electrawinds [73][74]. \n\nMoreover, the authorisation must be federal for installations with a capacity of 25 MW or \n\nhigher. Below this limit, no generation authorisation is required. Nevertheless, an environmental \n\nand building permission has to be applied in accordance with regional legislation [75].  \n\n \n\nAs a response to the opening up of the European electricity markets, an organised electricity \n\nmarket in Belgium was introduced in the end of 2006: Belgian electricity power exchange \n\n(Belpex), responsible for the spot market with daily transactions and intraday adjustments, plus \n\nthe Green Certificates Exchange. The Belpex\u2019s daily market is coupled with its neighbours, \n\nAPX in the Netherlands, EPEX Spot in France and Germany, and Nord Pool Spot in the Nordic \n\nregion, while the intraday market is linked only with APX and Nord Pool Spot.  \n\nBelpex, via APX, counts on a strong shareholder structure being composed, among others, by \n\ntwo electricity TSOs: ELIA in Belgium and TenneT in the Netherlands.   \n\nRegarding derivatives market, the Belgian power exchanges are provided by ICE-European \n\nEnergy Derivates Exchange (ICE-ENDEX). ICE ENDEX was established in March 2013, \n\nshortly after the split of energy exchange APX-ENDEX into APX and ENDEX. \n\n \n\nSupply\n\nMunicipal \ncompanies\n\nPure \nintercommunales\n\nMixed \nintercommunales\n\nCPTE\n\nDistribution\n\nMunicipal companies Mixed intercommunales Pure intercommunales\n\nTransmission\n\n( Electrabel and SPE operated the transmission networks through a joint cooperation)\n\nCPTE\n\nGeneration\n\nElectrabel SPE\n\nhttp://www.apxgroup.com/\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n104 \n\n \n\nAccording to the Directives, the transmission and distribution networks became a legal \n\nmonopoly. It was also demanded a legal separation and independency between the generation \n\nand supply activities, and a consequence was the establishment by CPTE of Elia System \n\nOperator (ELIA) for its network activities, in 2001. Right after, in 2002 ELIA has been chosen \n\nby the Belgian government as the TSO for the next 20 years.   \n\nHowever, ELIA has also the license as DSO in the Flanders for networks with voltage between \n\n26 kV and 70 kV, and is a local TSO in regions of Walonia and Brussels. Right now, in terms of \n\nownership, the company is fully unbundled since Electrabel sold its 24% share, partially to a \n\ncooperative company representing the Belgian municipalities (Publi-T), and partially to the \n\nmarket [73].  \n\n \n\nRegarding distribution networks under 30 kV, the grid is mostly operated by inter-municipal \n\ncompanies (mixed intercommunales). Moreover, in line with the European legislation, the \n\nmunicipal and inter-municipal companies had to stop their supply. \n\n \n\nConcerning the supply activity, four different supply licenses are available in Belgium since \n\nthere are four different authorities governing relationships between supplier and consumer, \n\nbeing the competent authority determined by the location and voltage at which the customer is \n\nconnected to the electricity grid [74]: \n\n \n\n? License submitted to the federal regulator, for trading electricity and supplying it to \nend-users connected to the transmission grid.  \n\n? License submitted to the regional regulator, depending on the location, for supply \nelectricity to end users connected to distribution networks. \n\n \n\nContinuing in the supply sector, all companies connected to the federal transmission network \n\nare free to choose their supplier since a period between 2000 and 2002. Regarding to domestic \n\nsector, users who are connected to the distribution networks, the Belgian energy market was \n\ngradually opened [73][76]: \n\n \n\n? Flanders: as from 1st January 2003; \n? Wallonia and Brussels: as from 1st January 2007. \n\n  \n\nDue the liberalisation some changes did occurred in this sector, with the entry of dozens of new \n\nelectricity suppliers and the ending of the municipalities\u2019 role in the supply activity. Thus, the \n\neligible customers who were previously operated by the mixed intercommunales and who did \n\nnot select a new supplier were from then on supplied by Electrabel, while the pure \n\nintercommunales transferred their retail activities to a new company called Luminus [73]. \n\n \n\nRegarding national regulatory authorities, the federal regulator is the Commission for the \n\nRegulation of Electricity and Gas (CREG). It was created in 2000, and its function is to advice \n\nthe Belgian authorities on the structure and operation of the liberalised electricity and gas \n\nmarkets, monitors the application and efficiency of relevant laws and regulations, including the \n\napproval of the tariff proposals submitted by the TSO and DSOs. Nevertheless, with the \n\nintroduction of the federal laws of 2005, CREG\u2019s mission became somewhat reduced in favour \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n105 \n\n \n\nof the Belgian Federal Energy Administration Ministry. Moreover, there are three regional \n\nenergy regulators [74]: \n\n \n\n? The Flemish Regulator of the Electricity and Gas market (VREG), responsible for \nregulate the region of Flanders;  \n\n? The Walloon Commission for Energy (CWaPE), responsible for regulate the region of \nWallonia; \n\n? The Brussels Regulator for Energy (BRUGEL), responsible for regulate the Brussels-\nCapital Region.  \n\n \n\nIn addition to supervising the operation of the electricity market, these institutions also play a \n\ncentral role in issuing supply licenses, authorising new power plants, including renewable \n\nenergy, and issuing and managing green power certificates.  \n\n \n\nThe regulators\u2019 competencies in the electricity sector are allocated according to the tension of \n\nthe relevant grids. Thus, for networks with a tension above 70 kV, the CREG regulates the \n\nentire Belgian territory, while for grids with tension below 70 kV, the regional regulators are \n\ncompetent for Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels-Capital, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n106 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 70.

Electricity Suppliers Operating in the Belgian Open Market \n\nTherefore, at the moment the Belgian electricity system can be represented by four big sectors, \n\nplus the regulators (Figure 71). \n\n \n\nElectricity generators are the first players in the chain, and at the moment there are several \n\nplayers operating in Belgium, including Electrabel, SPE-Luminus, REW, E.ON, EDF, Enoco, \n\nEni and Essent, or some smaller companies such as Aspiravi, Ecopower, Electrabel Green \n\nProjects Flanders and Electrawinds. \n\n \n\nWhile Belgium has a single TSO, Elia Transmission, in the distribution sector, the case is quite \n\ndifferent with several DSOs. As there are three Regions, each one has its DSOs. Thus, in \n\nBelgium, DSOs are ORES, Tecteo (Resa), R\u00e9gie de Wavre, AIESH, AIEG, IEH, INTEREST, \n\nINTERMOSANE and PBE in Wallonia, Sibelga in the Brussels-Capital Region and finally, \n\nEandis, ELIA and Infrax in Flanders [77].  \n\nNational Authorities Regulators\n\nCREG VREG CWaPE BRUGEL\n\nSupply\n\n(Regime of open competition by assignement of license agreement - 4 licenses )\n\nIndustrial companies \n(between 2000 and 2002)\n\nFlanders (as from 1st January \n2003)\n\nWallonia and Brussels (as \nfrom 1st January 2007)\n\nDistribution\n\nMixed intercommunales\n\nTransmission\n\n( Legal monopoly)\n\nCPTE's fragmentation to form ELIA\n\nGeneration\n\n(Regime of open competition by assignement of license agreement)\n\nFederal authorisation Regional authorisation\n\nhttp://www.ores.net/\nhttp://www.tecteo.be/\nhttp://www.regiewavre.be/\nhttp://www.aiesh.be/\nhttp://www.aieg.be/\nhttp://www.sibelga.be/\nhttp://www.eandis.be/\nhttp://www.infrax.be/\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n107 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe customers can be anyone from individuals to major industrial players.

Belgian Electricity System \n\n \n\nWith regards to the supply activity, nowadays, the Belgian customers may choose from a range \n\nof companies. Considering the three Regions, there are more than 20 electricity suppliers in the \n\ncountry.  \n\n \n\nAccording to VREG [78], there are in the Flanders territory 35 electricity suppliers.

Indeed, the region was the first to open up its market in the segment of the supply \n\nback in 2003. However, this does not explain everything. For instance, Flanders have been \n\nleading not only in innovative measures, as the Flemish Green Power Support Scheme and the \n\nFlemish Energy Company or even the installation of smart meters, but also in adapting the \n\nEuropean Directives to the Regional legislation, as the full ownership unbundling on \n\ndistribution level that must be achieved until 2018 [75]. \n\n   \n\nDespite the insufficient data, concerning the Wallonia and Brussels-Capital markets, which lead \n\nto a problem for a correct access and analyse of the Belgian electricity market, it is possible to \n\ncome up with a conclusion: there are three big players in the coutry, wherein two of them \n\n(Electrabel and EDF-Luminus, previously SPE) were operating in the market even before of the \n\nliberalisation. The third one is Eni Gas &amp; Power. \n\nNevertheless, paying attention to the most vibrant market (Flanders), there are some \u201cgreen\u201d \n\ncompanies, inclunding Lampiris or Ecopower, which will be studied in the next section, whose \n\nmarket shares are having a sustainable growth over the time, due to a mix of reasons, such as \n\ntheir visions of an electricity system based on RES, regional support schemes for smaller RES \n\ncompanies or the public awareness and debates for a new energy paradigm.  \n\n \n\n4.5.3. Ecopower \n\n \n\n \n\nUnlike Lampiris, Ecopower is a social company owned by its members. Founded 23 years ago \n\nin Belgium, Ecopower is one of the most known RES Cooperatives operating in Europe. As one \n\nof the first of the new wave of energy Cooperatives, Ecopower is an example for most of the \n\nCooperatives all over Europe, due not only for the introduction of several innovative practices \n\nand an exemplar management of its resources, that have led to a sustainable growth of the \n\nCooperative, but for being one of the founders of REScoop, an European Federation of groups \n\nand Cooperatives of citizens that was legally established under Belgian national law with an \n\nEuropean scope [61]. The aim of REScoop is to set the bases for a stronger European renewable \n\nenergy cooperative alliance. Thus, this European Federation aims to support and develop RES \n\nCooperatives promoting education, information and experience exchange, supporting research \n\nand the creation of new Cooperatives and helping to overcome financial and banking barriers. \n\nBy other words, REScoop represents its members at the national, regional and, particularly, at \n\nthe European level to create a level playing field for energy Cooperatives [61].  \n\nAmong its members, besides Ecopower, are for instance two of the case studies: EWS and Som \n\nEnergia. \n\n \n\nPresentations made, it is time to look more closely at Ecopower\u2019s history. It all began in 1991 \n\nwhen a group of 30 people, from ecological and social movements, came up with the idea of \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n111 \n\n \n\ncitizen energy production and sometime after, the project was officially recognised as \n\nCooperative by the Belgian government. \n\n \n\nThe years passed and at the turn of the century, something happened. In 1999, the city council \n\nof Eeklo, a small city near Ghent, decided to start a project for sustainable development. It soon \n\nbecame clear that a focus on energy was desirable and the decision was made to build \n\nwindmills. The city\u2019s environmental officer drew up a plan subject to several criteria: the \n\nwindmills should be built at least 250 metres from residential areas and they should not have a \n\nnegative impact on the ecological context of important nature conservation areas. At the end, \n\nthree sites were selected on which windmills could be installed according to the environmental \n\nand social criteria. As the city owned land on two of the sites, those places were put up for rent. \n\nThus, seven companies competed for the right to build and operate the windmills and at the end, \n\nEcopower came out as the winner [81]. But how was that possible, to beat private and \n\nconsolidated companies? \n\n \n\nIn fact, it was a result of an explicit information strategy and campaign \u2013 a shared initiative of \n\nEcopower and the city \u2013 the people of Eeklo were well informed and very supportive of the \n\nproject. Moreover, they were convinced of the windmills\u2019 potential and many have purchased \n\nshares in Ecopower, shares in what are now \u2018their\u2019 windmills.  \n\nThis event had such a big impact in Belgium, that the number of members increased, from 47 \n\nmembers that the Cooperative had in 1999, to around 700 in 2002 and almost 3 000 in the end \n\nof 2003 [61].  \n\n \n\nSince then, Ecopower have been invested in more RES projects, including wind power, PV, \n\nhydropower or biomasss across the country.  \n\nFor instance, during this year (2014), Ecopower aims to invest in a factory for wood pellets to \n\nbe used for residential heating. Also, a wind power project with 4 large wind turbines is being \n\nbuilt in Asse and preparations are made for a few more projects in Beersel (2 wind turbines), \n\nBilzen (1 wind turbine), Ghent (1 wind turbine) and Sint-Truiden (3 wind turbines), respectively \n\n[81]. \n\n \n\nHowever the boom of members happened in 2003, year in which the liberalisation of the \n\nBelgian energy market occurred. Thus, taking advantage of this event, Ecopower started a new \n\nactivity in its organisational structure: become a green electricity supplier [61]. \n\nThanks to this new activity, at the end of 2013 Ecopower reached the 40 000 customers. The \n\nkeys for success are simple: fairest and greenest electricity, and best customer service on the \n\nmarket. Moreover Ecopower, unlike the other energy suppliers, besides providing electricity \n\nalso intends to reduce the electricity bill of their customers, through energy efficiency policies.    \n\n \n\nBesides investing in its own projects, Ecopower also gives every kind of support in projects \n\ndeveloped by third parties: local groups of citizens, local co-ops, city councils or private \n\ncompanies. Actively supporting other RES Cooperatives is an important element of Ecopower's \n\nphilosophy. At the same time Ecopower wants to make people aware about RES energy and \n\nrational energy use in particular.  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n112 \n\n \n\nRegarding members, at the moment the Cooperative has more than 50 000 members. In the \n\nEcopower\u2019s scheme, interested citizens and organisations can buy one or more shares at a price \n\nof \u20ac 250 each. This gives them the right to one vote in the Cooperative\u2019s General Assembly, \n\nirrespective of the amount of shares that they have. \n\nHaving been granted recognition as a Cooperative, Ecopower is obliged to limit yields on \n\nshareholders\u2019 investments to a maximum of 6%. This is not necessarily an obstacle, however, as \n\nit creates some interesting possibilities given that the Cooperative can also pursue less profitable \n\nprojects. The financial surplus will be used for this purpose. In any case, 6% is quite a good rate \n\n\u2013 considering current interests on saving accounts [81]. \n\n  \n\n4.6.

Example of the form given to RES Cooperatives \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n116 \n\n \n\n \n\nBesides the four case studies (The Co-operative Energy, Som Energia, EWS and Ecopower), \n\ncompleted the form eight more RES Cooperatives: Enercoop from France, GoiEner S. Coop., \n\nNosa Enerx\u00eda S. Coop., Zencer S. Coop. and EnerPlus all from Spain, Greenpeace Energy eG \n\nfrom Germany and NLD Energie and DE Unie from Netherlands.  \n\n \n\nLooking to all the answers in question 2, there are two main causes behind the entry of the RES \n\nCooperatives in the electricity retail market: market opportunity and the non-existence of an \n\nenvironmentally friendly option.  \n\nAll the RES Cooperatives share both causes, Ecopower, Som Energia and Greenpeace Energy \n\nbeing perhaps the best examples; however there are some that are more inclined to each option, \n\nthan others.  \n\nIn relation to the first reason, whilst for instance Enercoop took advantage of the liberalisation \n\nof the French energy market to bring forth the idea of a decentralised model of power \n\nproduction and supply, where consumer is closer to the production, the case of the Co-operative \n\nEnergy is different, despite being also related with market opportunity. As part of the \n\nMidcounties Co-operative, a social enterprise that was already operating in several markets such \n\nas the food, funeralcare, pharmacy or post office for instance, the Co-operative Energy was the \n\nmissing piece in the Micounties Co-operative puzzle. Thus, the Co-operative Energy was \n\ncreated in 2010 as a result of a market opportunity in the British energy business, based on the \n\nlack of trust among consumers in the Big 6 energy suppliers.  \n\nLeading the second reason, there is EWS, which became an electricity supplier before the \n\nliberalisation of the energy markets. The decision of EWS to start supplying electricity was a \n\nnatural consequence of a protest against nuclear power.  As the renounce of the use of nuclear \n\nenergy itself was not enough to build up a new energetic paradigm, the people of Sch\u00f6nau \n\ndecided to demonstrate that a green electricity supply in the village was possible, including a \n\nnew tariff structure, and the only option available at the time was the buy of the electricity grid.    \n\nRelative to NLD Energie and DE Unie, there were a couple of reasons put forward, but the most \n\nimportant was the possibility to introduce a truly local company that promoted local \n\nsustainability. \n\n  \n\nConcerning RES Cooperatives, whose entry in the electricity retail market is a declared mix of \n\nboth reasons, starting by Greenpeace Energy the liberalisation of the German energy market in \n\n1998 opened up the possibility to supply customers with green electricity. As at the time there \n\nwas any supplier capable to provide high quality green electricity, Greenpeace e.V. took matters \n\nand created in autumn 1999 the Greenpeace Energy, a RES Cooperative legally and financially \n\nindependent of the environmental protection organisation. In the next year, Greenpeace Energy \n\nstarted supplying customers with clean electricity according to the Greenpeace early idea. \n\nThe Ecopower history is similar to Greenpeace Energy, although the decision to start supplying \n\nelectricity was initiated by its members at the General Assembly in 2003 after the liberalisation \n\nof the electricity market for private households in Flanders.  \n\nRelative to Som Energia, the Cooperative started in 2010, and shortly after, and in accordance \n\nwith its mission (a new energetic paradigm), the Cooperative identified an opportunity in the \n\nSpanish electricity market: the promoting of an electricity model based on RES. Thus, it didn\u2019t \n\ntake too long to Som Energia to start supplying green electricity to its members, as well as the \n\nconstruction of RES power plants.  \n\nThe Som Energia's ideology is shared with four more Spanish Cooperatives: Zencer, Nosa \n\nEnerx\u00eda, EnerPlus and GoiEner. In their own way they all have the will to provide consumers \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n117 \n\n \n\nthe democratic access to liberalised electricity, supported by 100% green electricity and the \n\nchance the customer taking control of its own power company, fighting thus the low level of \n\ntrust in the energy companies and the corruption in the Spanish energy business. \n\nMoreover, in relation to GoiEner, just like several other RES Cooperatives, the Cooperative \n\naimed to start its activity as an electricity producer based on RES, and just then spread its \n\ndomains into the electricity retailing. However, due to cut of the feed-in tariffs introduced by the \n\nSpanish legislation in early 2012, the GoiEner was forced to turn its focus for the electricity \n\nretailing market.  \n\n \n\nAlthough currently all these RES Cooperatives are supplying electricity in their own market, it \n\ndoes not mean it was an easy process for them. Besides Ecopower, DE Unie, NLD Energie Som \n\nEnergia, which ranked their process as 5 and 4, respectively, the majority of the RES \n\nCooperatives assessed their electricity retailing supply process as hard or very hard. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 76. Result of the question 4: \u201cHow long did the whole process take?\u201d \n\n \n\nNo doubt the national legislation, which differs among EU members, matters to the time it takes \n\nto fulfil the electricity retailing supply process. However, it is not the main factor. Based on the \n\nexperience provided by the RES Cooperatives, the minimum period to start supplying electricity \n\nis 6 months and may exceed one year depending on the method chosen to operate on the \n\norganised energy market (Figure 76). \n\nA side note to the EWS case, which took several years to be concluded. As they started \n\nsupplying electricity before the liberalisation of the German energy market, at that time it was \n\nrequired to run the distribution grid in order to supply electricity. The licenses to run the grid are \n\nstill given by the municipalities. In most of the cases the concession is for periods above 15 \n\nyears and has to be announced at least 1 year in advance, so at this point it is possible to realise \n\nthe complexity of the EWS\u2019s electricity retailing supply process. Moreover, besides the license \n\nto run the grid a license to supply was also required. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n118 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 77. Result of the question 5: \u201cWhat was the main barriers the RES Cooperatives had to face during the \n\nentire process?\u201d \n\n \n\nIndependently of the time it takes to complete the electricity retailing supply process, there are \n\nseveral barriers that the RES Cooperatives had to face during the entire process (Figure 77). \n\nAccording to their feedback, it is possible to highlight the legislative complexity, including the \n\ndifficulty to clarify any doubts, as well as the financial issues as the main obstacles to become \n\nan electricity supplier. \n\nNevertheless, for Enercoop and Som Energia the biggest issue was the access to the organised \n\nenergy market. Besides that, for Enercoop the problem number one was the market context.  \n\n \n\nBased on the RES Cooperatives\u2019 response, a national RES Cooperative shall overcome these \n\nbarriers through several ways. Thus, the best advice that the Cooperative may have at this point \n\nis to be fully committed to the project, studying and analysing the current national regulations of \n\nthe electricity sector. Moreover, the RES Cooperative shall seek for outside collaborations. \n\nWorking together with different partners (other Cooperatives, social economy organisations, \n\npublic institutions or energy experts) may help overcoming the lack of knowledge and \n\nexperience in the business, as well as any financial issue.  \n\nFinally, it is important to be patient and to have perseverance during the development of the \n\nelectricity retailing supply process.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 78. Result of the question 7: \u201c How many licenses did the RES Cooperatives have to fulfil to operate in \n\nthe national electricity retail market?\u201d \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n119 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs shown in Figure 78, the number of licenses varies from country, as well as the strategy \n\nchosen by the RES Cooperative to supply electricity in their national electricity retail market.  \n\nBefore the liberalisation of the energy market, the EWS just needed two permissions to start \n\nsupplying electricity: one for running the grid and another one for the supply itself. Still in \n\nGermany, Greenpeace Energy has a comparable number, three licenses, even though the \n\nCooperative started supplying after the liberalisation of the German electricity market.  \n\nIn relation to the Spanish RES Cooperatives, the number goes from two to more than five. The \n\nexplanation is maybe related to the method chosen to purchase electricity in the MIBEL, as it \n\nwill be seen right away. \n\nLooking to the Benelux\u2019s RES Cooperatives, the NLD Energie and DE Unie needed two \n\npermissions given by the Dutch Authority for Consumers &amp; Market, to operate as an energy \n\nsupplier. For Ecopower, the number of licenses reaches five, and the reason may be related to \n\nthe fact that Belgium is divided in three regions, each one with its own regional energy \n\nregulator. \n\nFinally, the Co-operative required to fulfil more than five licenses to start supplying electricity \n\nin the UK.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 79. Result of the question 8: \u201c When the RES Cooperative started the retailing supply activity, what \n\nwas the method chosen to purchase electricity in the organised electricity market?\u201d \n\n \n\nAnalysing the 12 RES Cooperatives, from the several options to operate on the organised \n\nelectricity market the chosen method was (Figure 79): To purchase electricity directly on the \n\nmarket (Enercoop, Greenpeace Energy, The Co-operative Energy and Zencer). \n\nNevertheless, there are also RES Cooperatives, such as DE Unie, Ecopower, EnerPlus and Nosa \n\nEnerx\u00eda, which in the beginning of the supply activity opted for not participate in the energy \n\nmarket. Basically, their strategy is to operate as an intermediate company but the billing is made \n\nby the RES Cooperative. \n\nMoreover, there are also RES Cooperatives which access the market through a Representative \n\nAgent, via a BPO agreement (GoiEner, Som Energia and NLD Energie). \n\nRelative to EWS, the RES Cooperative buys electricity directly from RES producers. This \n\nmethod is also used as a complement by the Co-operative Energy.   \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n120 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 80. Result of the question 9: \u201c What was the total ammount of financial warranties the RES \n\nCooperative had to provide in the end of the process?  \n\n \n\nAs the financial issue is one of the biggest barriers a RES Cooperative faces during the process, \n\nit is worth a closer look (Figure 80). Based on the RES Cooperatives\u2019 feedback, it is possible to \n\nget the permission for energy retailing and start supplying with less than \u20ac 50,000.  \n\nJust focusing on the Spanish RES Cooperatives, as their national legislation is quite similar to \n\nthe Portuguese and it also shares the same organised energy market, it is possible to come up \n\nwith the certainty that a RES Cooperative, that aims to operate in Portugal, just needs \u20ac 50,000 \n\nto start offering electricity to Portuguese customers.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 81. Result of the question 10: \u201c What was the consumers\u2019 receptivity to the RES Cooperative entry in \n\nthe eelctricity market?  \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding it is a lengthy and complex process, the rewards do not take too long to occur. \n\nAccording to the RES Cooperatives experience, from the moment that the Cooperative enters in \n\nthe electricity retail market, its offers are seen with good eyes by the consumer (Figure 81). \n\nDespite Zencer, which ranked the consumer\u2019s receptivity to its offer as three, all the other RES \n\nCooperatives rate as four and five the consumer\u2019s acceptance to their entry in the electricity \n\nretail market. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n121 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 82.

However, when the RES Cooperative get \n\nthe permission for electricity retailing, it will be equally important to come up with some \n\nmeasures that will allow its offer to be chosen by the consumers. Thus, according to the RES \n\nCooperatives experience, the most relevant aspect that stands out is the green and clean \n\nelectricity (Figure 82). Besides this competitive advantage, as the Cooperative does not have the \n\nsame tools as the big energy companies (TV ads and newspapers ads), the local promotion \n\nthrough talking face-to-face and the participation in public events, as well as the collaboration \n\nwith other public organisations, such as Cooperatives or social movements, are definitely other \n\nmeasures Coop\u00e9rnico may takes to settle down in the energy market.  \n\nFor instance, the NLD Energie has partnerships with other local RES Cooperatives, which act as \n\nNLD Energie's resellers. \n\nMoreover, another big advantage introduced by the RES Cooperatives is related to the reduction \n\nof the electricity consumption of their customers, through energy saving measures. The RES \n\nCooperatives have the real concern to reduce the electricity bill of the national consumers, on \n\nthe opposite of the big energy companies.  \n\n \n\nIn relation to question 12, the number of RES Cooperatives for which it is mandatory to a \n\ncustomer become a member of the Cooperative is practically equal to those which is not \n\nrequired. \n\nTaking the example of two RES Cooperatives that complemented their answers: GoiEner and \n\nSom Energia. While in the first case the \u201cYES\u201d is related to a financial support that the RES \n\nCooperative needs due to operation in the energy market (deviations), in relation to Som \n\nEnergia it was mandatory a customer to be a member as well in the beginning of the electricity \n\nretailing. However, nowadays the answer is \u201cNO\u201d, once each member can bring into the \n\nCooperative five electricity contracts of friends and/or family. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n122 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 83. Result of the question 13: \u201cWhat makes the people join the RES Cooperative and participate in the \n\ngreen revolution?\u201d \n\n \n\nFinally, as important as the measures defined by the Cooperative to strike the electricity market, \n\nis to understand what leads the consumer to become a member and/or a customer of the RES \n\nCooperative. Despite cultural differences between Europeans, considering that the RES \n\nCooperatives which participated in this survey are from three different European regions, \n\nSouthern Europe (Portugal and Spain), Central Europe (Germany) and Western Europe \n\n(Netherlands, Belgium and UK), the motivations that make people join to such green revolution \n\nare basically the same regardless of the place of origin or traditional culture. \n\nThus, as shown in Figure 83, the biggest motivation for the consumer is the Pro-RES approach. \n\nPeople are increasingly more aware about what is going on in the world and believe that the use \n\nof RES is the only possible way out for a new global energetic paradigm. Moreover, the \n\nconsumer believes that this new energetic paradigm should be built on a decentralised model of \n\npower production and supply, which contributes for the development of the local community \n\nand economy, and interestingly wants to participate and conduct itself this \"green revolution\", \n\nthrough the governance of their local energy systems and utilities. \n\nHowever, there are customers who do not know anything about the mission and vision of the \n\nRES Cooperative when they choose a new electricity supplier; they just switch due to the lack \n\nof trust in the big energy companies and the perceived corruption in the energy business. \n\nBasically, they just switch because there is a new offer in the market and hope to have a good \n\nservice provided with this new entity. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n123 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 84. Relation between the number of members and customers, since the RES Cooperative started the \n\nelectricity retailing activity  \n\n \n\nIt was plotted on a graph the evolution of the number of members and customers since the \n\nbeginning of the electricity retailing supply activity of the four case studies. As shown in Figure \n\n84, the possibility to offer electricity has definitely contributed for the prosperity and growth of \n\nall the four RES Cooperatives which means that, the probability of happening the same with \n\nCoop\u00e9rnico is real and is within reach of us all. Therefore, it is possible to confirm that the \n\nability to retail electricity can increase the number of members of the Cooperative, and thus \n\nsharing with more people the RES Cooperative's vision for a new energetic paradigm that \n\nbenefits the society as well as the environment. \n\n \n\n5. Portuguese Electricity Market \n\n5.1. An Overview of the Portuguese Liberalised Market \n\nLooking back into the evolution of the Portuguese electricity system it all started right after the \n\nPortuguese revolution, when key Portuguese power companies were nationalised. Aiming to \n\nhave a single undertaking responsible for power generation, transmission and distribution of \n\nelectricity throughout the territory, in 1976 a vertically-integrated monopoly company called \n\nElectricidade de Portugal (EDP) was created. \n\nMeanwhile, in 1981 Decree-Law 20/81 referred for the first time the possibility of self-\n\ngeneration, for entities accessorily producing electricity from RES or using technologies that \n\nwould lead to the reduction of primary energy consumption. In 1986, Decree-Law 149/86 \n\nextended the idea to plants exclusively producing electricity and two years late, the Decree-Law \n\n189/88 recognised that a faster process was needed and the creation of conditions allowing for \n\nthe economic viability of the small plants. This Decree-Law replaced the previous documents \n\nand established the rules for independent power production, allowing this production from RES \n\nand cogeneration [83]. \n\nTherefore, the Portuguese electricity system before the liberalisation may be represented \n\nthrough the figure 85:  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n124 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 85. Main features of the Portuguese pre liberalisation \n\n \n\nBriefly, as it will be discussed in the next section, the liberalisation of the Portuguese electricity \n\nmarket started in 1995, through a series of decree laws that anticipated the main principles of \n\nthe First Directive.  \n\nFrom that moment on, and in line with what was happening elsewhere in the Europe, the current \n\nPortuguese electricity system is the natural consequence of the successive transposition of the \n\nEuropean Directives at the national level (Figure 86 and Figure 87). \n\n \n\nSupply\n\nEDP\n\nDistribution\n\nEDP\n\nTransmission\n\nEDP\n\nGeneration\n\nEDP Self-generation\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n125 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 86. Main features of the pos Portuguese liberalisation \n\n \n\nThus, and regarding the generation activity, companies may choose between two types of \n\nauthorisations: Ordinary and Special Regime. The main players operating in Portugal are \n\nbasically the same as in Spain: EDP, Iberdrola, Endesa and Galp. \n\nAware that Portugal is a country full of natural resources, in the beginning of the century the \n\nPortuguese government led by Jos\u00e9 Socrates, introduced aggressive national policies to \n\naccelerate RES use. Such measures allowed the entry and growth of companies such as \n\nAcciona, Martifer Solar, dst Renov\u00e1veis, Generg, Enercon, GE and GDF-Suez or the flowering \n\nof SMEs, such as Boa Energia, Ikaros-Hemera, Solar Project, FFSolar, Eurosolar, SunEnergy, \n\nArm\u00e9nio Carreira Energias Renov\u00e1veis, PluriEnergia, Enforce, SmartWatt or Catavento, for \n\ninstance.  \n\n \n\nIn Portugal there is only one TSO and DSO: Rede El\u00e9ctrica Nacional (REN) and EDP \n\nDistribui\u00e7\u00e3o, respectively. Despite the legal unbundling of the electric transmission network in \n\n1996, since 2000 the high-voltage grid is owned by REN. \n\n \n\nConcerning the supply activity, the industrial sector was the first to be open up to competition, \n\nbetween 1999 and 2002. However, the eligibility of the household consumers was only effective \n\nin 2006, one year ahead the Second Directive\u2019s framework.   \n\n \n\nNational Authorities Regulators\n\nERSE DGEG\n\nSupply\n\n(Regime of open competition by assignement of license agreement)\n\nlarge industrial consumers ( \nbetween 1999 and 2002)\n\nall other consumers  (as from \n2006)\n\nDistribution\n\nEDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nTransmission\n\n( Legal monopoly)\n\nREN\n\nGeneration\n\n(Regime of open competition by assignement of license agreement)\n\nOrdinary Regime Special Regime\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n126 \n\n \n\nIn relation to national regulatory authorities, currently there are two entities responsible for \n\nproper functioning of the Portuguese electricity system: ERSE and DGEG.  \n\nAlso, Portugal shares with Spain an organised market, MIBEL, that include a day ahead market, \n\nlocated in Spain and managed by OMIE, and a forward and derivatives market, located in \n\nPortugal and managed by OMIP.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 87. Portuguese electricity system \n\n \n\n5.2. Evolution of the Legislative Framework behind the Portuguese Liberalised \n\nMarket \n\nThe organisational framework of the National Electricity System (SEN10) was approved in 1995 \n\n(Decrew-Law 182/95 to 185/95) and established the coexistence of an Electricity Public Service \n\nSystem (EPSS) and an Independent Electricity System (IES), organised according to a market \n\nlogic. This framework was changed in 1997, in order to fully incorporate the principles of the \n\nFirst Directive of the EPC of 19th December [84][85].   \n\nSix years later, the Directive 96/92/EC was amended by a new document, Directive 2003/54/EC \n\nof the EPC of 26th June. As a consequence of these new guidelines to the establishment of the \n\nIEM, the framework set up in 1995 and then in 1997, was replaced by some transitional \n\nframeworks. It took almost three years for the government to approve a new national strategy \n\ncontemplating the liberalisation process and promote competition in the energy market in \n\naccordance with the Second Directive guidelines. \n\n \n\nThe signing of the Decree-Law n\u00ba 29/2006 [84], from 15th February, sets an electricity sector \n\nlegislative framework articulated and coherent with the EU lines, including the key strategic \n\ngoals approved by the European document released three years before. Thereby, the Decree-\n\nLaw established the new organisational and operational principles of the SEN as well as the \n\ngeneral laws applicable to the exercise of generation, transmission, distribution and supply \n\nactivities, in order to promote an open and competitive market. \n\nGoing deep inside the document, in contrast with the previous regime, the new framework \n\nestablished an integrated SEN where the generation and supply activities fall under the regime \n\nof open competition by assignment of license agreement, and the transmission and distribution \n\n                                                      \n10 National Electricity System (SEN): Group of principles, organisations, agents and electricity \n\ninfrastructures related with all the activities stated by the Decree-Law, in the national territory [84][85]. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n127 \n\n \n\nactivities are performed by assigning of public service concessions (Figure 88). According to \n\nthe Decree-Law these activities are supposed to be performed taking into account the correct use \n\nof the resources available and environment protection, including energy efficiency and the \n\npromotion of RES, plus the no damage to the obligations of public services [84][85].     \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 88. General features about the four sectors of SEN \n\n \n\nRegarding the generation activity, there are two types of generators. According to the Articles \n\n17 and 18 of the Decree-Law n\u00ba 29/2006, they are defined as: \n\n \n\n? Ordinary Regime Generator (ORG): It is considered all the generation activity that is \nnot covered by a special legislation regime for electricity generation (e.g incentives for \n\nusing RES or combined-cycle power plants); \n\n? Special Regime Generator (SRG): It is considered all the generation activity under a \nspecial legislation regime in the scope of adopting policies to encourage the generation \n\nof electricity, including the use of RES or combined-cycle power plants.      \n\n \n\nThere are also differences regarding to commercial relation. While the ORG can sell their \n\nelectricity through the celebration of bilateral contracts both to end-users consumers and \n\nelectricity suppliers, or through the participation in the organised markets, the SRG has \n\nprivileged access regarding the commercialisation of the electricity to the last resort electricity \n\nsupplier, under the conditions laid down in specific legislation. However, both have the right to \n\nensure the supply in accordance with the liberalised market. \n\n \n\nSupply\n\n(Regime of open competition by assignment of license agreement)\n\nElectricity Supplier Last Resort Electricity Supplier\n\nDistribution\n\n(Regime of exclusivity and performed by assignement of public service concession)\n\nTransmission\n\n(Regime of exclusivity and performed by assignement of public service concession)\n\nGeneration\n\n(Regime of open competition by assignement of license agreement)\n\nOrdinary Regime Generator Special Regime Generator\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n128 \n\n \n\nAccording to the document, the electricity transmission activity is carried out by exploiting the \n\nNational Transmission Grid (RNT), and must be performed through a regime of exclusivity and \n\nby assignment of public service concession. This activity is considered legal and patrimonially \n\nseparated from the other activities carried out under the SEN, and hence must ensure the \n\nindependence and transparency of the activity exercise and its relationship with the others \n\nplayers acting in the SEN. As the RNT plays a vital role in the SEN, its operation integrates the \n\noverall technical management of the system ensuring then a good symbioses between the \n\ngeneration plants and the distribution activity. Essentially, its role is to ensure the security of \n\nsupply and an integrated and efficient system operation.     \n\n \n\nThere is also another important activity in the SEN: the distribution of electricity. This activity \n\nis carried out through the operation of the National Distribution Grid (RND), which \n\ncorresponds to the Medium and High-Voltage grid and the Low-Voltage grid. Such as the \n\ntransmission activity, the Medium and High-Voltage grid is also operated through an exclusive \n\nconcession granted by the Portuguese government. In respect to the Low-Voltage grid continues \n\nto be exploited by municipal concession, and there will be no loss for them if they directly \n\nexplore their networks.  \n\nOnce again, this activity is legally separated from the transmission and the other activities not \n\nrelated to distribution. However this legal independence is not mandatory when a Low-Voltage \n\ndistributors serves less than 100 000 customers.  \n\n \n\nRegarding the supply activity, the Decree-Law n\u00ba 29/2006 sets the electricity supply activity \n\nopen to competition, subject only to a licensing agreement regime. The electricity supply \n\nactivity involves the buying and selling of electricity to end-user consumers or other agents \n\nunder acquisition modalities that will be reviewed in the following section.  For that, they have \n\nthe right of access to the transmission and distribution grids on payment of regulated tariffs. \n\nAccording to the same document, similar to the generation, in this activity there are two types of \n\nsuppliers:  \n\n \n\n? Ordinary Electricity Supplier; \n? Last Resort Electricity Supplier (LRES). \n\n \n\nBasically, by the Article 46 the difference between both is that the last one is subject to \n\nuniversal service obligations, ensuring to all consumers who request the meet of their electricity \n\nneeds and are in compliance with applicable legislation for the effect. Also, it is an entity that is \n\nexpected to act while the open market does not operate with full effectiveness and efficiency. \n\nMeanwhile, the role of LRES is, provisionally, allocated to electricity distributors for the \n\nduration of their concession. \n\n \n\nIn the context of consumer protection, the same document defines \u201cuniversal service\u201d by the \n\nsecurity of supply in terms of quality and continuity of service and protection regarding to \n\ntariffs as well as prices, and access to clear information.     \n\n \n\nTherefore, the consumers may choose, without restrictions, their electricity supplier, not being \n\nthe switch of supplier charged under the contractual point of view. Moreover, in order to \n\nsimplify and make the switch of electricity supplier effective, it was also anticipated the creation \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n129 \n\n \n\nof an independent entity in a legal, organisational and decision-making sense, from the other \n\nentities in the SEN, called Logistic Operator for Switching Suppliers (OLMC).  \n\n \n\nAlso according to the Decree-Law, the activities of transmission, distribution, LRES and OLMC \n\nare subject of regulation, without prejudice for the competences of other administrative bodies, \n\nby the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE). Besides ERSE, there is another regulator \n\ncalled Directorate General for Energy and Geology (DGEG), which responsibility is to \n\nmonitoring the security of supply in collaboration with the concessionaire of the RNT. Both \n\nregulators have the responsibility to release an annual report concerning the development of the \n\nelectricity sector, to the Portuguese government and EC. \n\n \n\nThe Decree-Law n\u00ba 29/2006, from 15th February, which laid the baselines of the organisation \n\nand operation of the new electricity sector, refers to complementary legislation a set of \n\nconclusive norms, namely the procedural legal regimes of the activities of generation, \n\ntransmission, distribution and supply of electricity, as well as the laws governing the activities \n\nof the logistics operation of switching supplier of electricity.  \n\nThereby, in the development and implementation of the principles said in the document, the \n\nDecree-Law n\u00ba 172/2006, from 23th August, establish the procedures of license agreement \n\nassignment for generators (ORG and SRG), as well as public service concession assignment for \n\nthe RNT and RND [84][85]. \n\nWith regard to the electricity supply activity, in 2009 was released the Dispatch n\u00ba 9244/2009 \n\nregulating the content of the Article 50 of the amended document (Decree-Law n\u00ba 172/2006) \n\n[84][85]. The dispatch established all electricity supplier had the obligation to publish their \n\npricing, using for this purpose the modalities of service and information to customers provided \n\nin the regulations for Quality of Service of the Electricity Sector, reinforcing thus the necessity \n\nof electricity suppliers to send to ERSE the following pricing information, as stated in the above \n\nArticle 50: \n\n \n\n? The reference table charged or planning to charge, whenever a change occurs \nconcerning prices;  \n\n?

Being the MIBEL\u2019s construction a top priority in \n\nthe political agenda of the region, in order to take a step forward towards the liberalisation of the \n\nSEN, the Decree-Law n\u00ba 138-A/2010, from 28th December, had as the main objective the \n\ncreation of social tariffs for end-users economically vulnerable ensuring then to every customer \n\nthe access to the SEN [84][85].    \n\n \n\nIn tune with the Directive 2009/72/EC, in 20th June 2011 it was made the second amendment of \n\nthe Decree-Law n\u00ba29/2006 with the introduction of a new organisational framework of the SEN: \n\nThe Decree-Law n\u00ba 78/2011 (Figure 89) [84][85].   \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                            \n13 Medium-Voltage (MV): Voltage between phases whose effective value is greater than 1 kV and less \n\nthan or equal to 45 kV. \n\n14 Special Low-Voltage (SpLV): LV supply or delivery where contracted power is (i) Mainland Portugal - \ngreater than 41.4 kW, (ii) Autonomous Region of the Azores \u2013 equal to or greater than 20.7 kW and is \n\nachieved by way of maximum power at 15 minute intervals, (iii) Autonomous Region of Madeira greater \n\n62.1 kW). \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n131 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 89. General features introduced by the Decree-Law n\u00ba 78/2011 \n\n \n\nThis document is the Portuguese interpretation of the Third Package and therefore aims to \n\nreinforce the division between the activities of generation and electricity supply, as well as the \n\noperation of the transmission gridlines as a way to achieve the establishment of an integrated \n\nIEM in the EU that allows the implementation of a more effective market competition. Thus, the \n\nDecree-Law n\u00ba 78/2011 suggests [84][85]: \n\n \n\n? ERSE to execute a certification procedure to the operator of the RNT, in order to assess \nthe conditions of separation of activities; \n\n? Regarding to distribution activity, it is expected the strengthen of the transparency in the \nlegal separation of activities, since the operator of the RND belonging to vertically \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n132 \n\n \n\nintegrated company and serve a number of customers exceeding 100 000 shall need to \n\ndevelop a compliance program that includes measures taken to exclude discriminatory \n\nconduct. Moreover, it is established the rules for closed-grids which contemplates the \n\npossibility of intervention by the ERSE in the analysis and assessment of access tariffs, \n\nin cases of lack of transparency or fairness. \n\n \n\nThe Decree-Law n\u00ba 78/2011 also empower the role of the regulators, ensuring more \n\nindependence in the exercise of their regulatory functions, including supervision and \n\ncertification. For instance: \n\n \n\n? It is strengthened ERSE\u2019s role, namely in the certification of the operator of the RNT, \npromotion of regional markets and coordination of gridlines at European level through a \n\ncooperation with other regulatory entities, in accordance with the EU legislations.  \n\n \n\nWith regard to consumer protection, the Decree-Law aims to extend its policies relating to this \n\nfield. It is expected the consumers rights are preserved by the introduction of new mechanisms, \n\nincluding: \n\n \n\n? The reduction of the electricity supplier switching period to lesser than three weeks. The \nconsumers are able to achieve the switch without having to pay any termination fees; \n\n? Complaint management is responsibility of the regulator authorities, namely ERSE and \nDGEG.  \n\n? Creation of a centralised information platform which offers relevant information, \nincluding the legislation on the protection of electricity consumers and dispute \n\nresolution mechanisms to protect their rights. \n\n? Inclusion of the consumer protection policies, in particular the \u201cend-user economically \nvulnerable\u201d concept and its features, stated in the Decree-Law n\u00ba 138-A/2010. \n\n \n\nFinally, it is expected from the Decree-Law n\u00ba 78/2011 to reinforce the rules of RNT and RND \n\nplanning, so Portugal can keep in line with the EU goals of an IEM.  \n\n \n\nTrying to face the economic crisis that Portugal has been going through, Decree-Law n\u00ba \n\n102/2011, from 30th September, was released with additional measures respecting the consumer \n\nprotection. Thereby, in order to help guaranteeing all consumers the access to basic needs, \n\nincluding electricity, it was created the Extraordinary Social Support to the Energy Consumer \n\n(ASECE).     \n\n \n\nAt the same time this Decree-Law was published, two more documents were announced \n\n[84][85]:  \n\n \n\n? Ordinance n\u00ba 275-A/2011, from 30th September; \n? Ordinance n\u00ba 275-B/2011, from 30th September. \n\n \n\nIn execution to the previous Decree- Law, the Ordinance n\u00ba 275-A/2011 and the Ordinance n\u00ba \n\n275-B/2011 set the discount of the ASECE to be applied to electricity bills of end-users \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n133 \n\n \n\neconomically vulnerable and establish all the necessary procedures and conditions to the \n\nassignment, application, conservation and monitoring of the ASECE, respectively.    \n\nContinuing the process initiated two years before by the Decree-Law n\u00ba 104/2010, the Decree-\n\nLaw n\u00ba 75/2012, from 26th March, established a timetable predicting the extinction of regulated \n\ntariffs to end-users customers with consumption in StLV15. Regarding to this third amend of the \n\nDecree-Law n\u00ba 29/2006, it will be object of further analysis in the following section.  \n\n \n\nRight after, it was published in 23th May 2012 the fourth amend (Decree-Law n\u00ba 112/2012) \n\naiming the participation restriction in the share capital of the RNT and RND operators [84][85].  \n\n \n\nThe fifth and sixth amend to the previous Decree-Law n\u00ba 29/2006, arrived in 2012. With the \n\nDecree-Law n\u00ba 215-A/2012 and the Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-B/2012, from 8th September, as it was \n\nexpected a new adjustment in the organisational framework of the SEN towards the promotion \n\nof competitiveness, price transparency, as well as the correct functioning and full liberalisation \n\nof the electricity market (Figure 90) [84][85]. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n15 Standard Low-Voltage (StLV): LV supply or delivery where contracted power is (i) Mainland Portugal \n- 41.4 kW or lower, (ii) Autonomous Region of the Azores \u2013 215 kW or lower and is not achieved by way \n\nof maximum power at 15 minute intervals, (iii) Autonomous Region of Madeira 62.1 kVA or lower. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n134 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 90. General features introduced by the Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-A/2012 and Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-B/2012 \n\n \n\nIn order to complete the full integration of the Directive 2009/72/EC, the first sector of the SEN \n\nto be modified was the generation activity.  \n\nThe Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-A/2012 revealed changes regarding to the types of generators. That \n\nmeans, the SRG shall now comprise two models of remuneration: \n\n \n\n? The market remuneration regime (subject to market conditions); \n? And the previous special legislation regime. \n\n   \n\nWith respect to the transmission activity, the Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-A/2012 lay down new rules \n\nconcerning the RNT operator. For this purpose, in addition to the revision of the accreditation \n\nand review of the certification procedure if the concessionaire of the RNT is controlled by an \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n135 \n\n \n\nentity belonging to EU, it is also expected now the same procedure if the operator is owned by \n\nsome entity from countries outside the EU. \n\n \n\nStill in the transmission activity, the same document clarify and reinforce the requirements on \n\nindependence, and legal separation concerning the RNT operator (full ownership unbundling), \n\nstated by the Decree-Law n\u00ba 112/2012. Therefore, it was suggested an alternative legal \n\nseparation model to the current on provided by the Directive 2009/72/EC, through the figure of \n\nthe ITO whose practicability depends on the application of the concessionaire RNT and \n\napproval by the Portuguese government. These measures are expected to  give ERSE free access \n\nin decision and conclusion of such procedures. \n\n \n\nAlso, it set up mechanisms that allow the Portuguese government to monitor and supervise the \n\nactivities of the RNT operator, that are not directly related to the RNT or the technical \n\nmanagement of the system, in order to ensure that such activities are carried out independently \n\nand in harmony with the public interest. \n\n  \n\nIn relation to the RND, the Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-A/2012 wants to guarantee the independency of \n\nthe RND operator regarding the interests of electricity generation and supply. Thereby, it is \n\nexpected the removal of the risk of discrimination in access to the gridlines and the prevention \n\nconcerning the share of confidential information.  \n\n \n\nAs for the electricity supply activity, the obligation to purchase electricity generated under a \n\nspecial regime imposed on the LRES, passes now to be limited as long as the SRG benefit from \n\nspecial tariffs or other guaranteed compensation. \n\nAfter this period, the SRG will be able to sell their electricity on organized markets or through \n\nbilateral contracts as the ORG already do, or may sell it to a new regulated supplier called \n\nAggregator Market Facilitator (AMF). This new entity, which will be assigned under license \n\nagreement, will purchase the electricity generated to open market prices, and will act as an \n\naggregator of generation. In other words, the AMF has the obligation to purchase electricity for \n\ngenerators that wish it. \n\n \n\nFocusing on the most significant changes of the Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-B/2012, in the present \n\nDecree-Law was gathered all the legislation related to the SRG, that before was spreaded by \n\nseveral documents.  \n\n \n\nWith regard to electricity supply, with the Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-B/2012 access and operating \n\nrules in the open market have been simplified. That means, apart from the LRES and the AMF, \n\nthe electricity supply activity is now open to competition, only subject to prior registration.  \n\n \n\nFinally, in relation to consumer protection, the Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-B/2012 sets the electricity \n\nsupply by LRES, not only to end-users economically vulnerable but also in places where there \n\nis no electricity suppliers under market regime, as well as in situations where the electricity \n\nsupplier has been forbidden to execute its activity. Besides that, the document also expects \n\nERSE to come up with a new centralised platform where consumers can have access to \n\ninformation beyond the one demanded in the Decree-Law n\u00ba 78/2011, including for instance \n\nlatest legislations and the reference prices of all electricity suppliers. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n136 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the light of the commitments and objectives behind the Decree-Law n\u00ba 75/2012, Decree-Law \n\nn\u00ba 256/2012 adopted a set of measures aiming to prevent the rising trend of the various costs \n\nwhich affect, in the medium to long term, the final electricity bill, as well as the continuing \n\nexponential growth of the tariff deficit. \n\nAmong the several measures aiming the stability of the tariff system, the Decree-Law n\u00ba \n\n256/2012, from 29th November, determines the extension of the extinction period of regulated \n\ntariffs to end-users customers with consumption in VHV and HV, MV and SpLV, in order to \n\nguarantee the correct transition to the liberalised market. Therefore, and despite the Decree-Law \n\nn\u00ba 104/2010 predicted all the costumers should now be supplied under the liberalised market, \n\nuntil the end of 31st December 2011, the Statement of Correction n\u00ba 78/2012 declared that \n\nLRES must continue to supply electricity to end-users customers with consumption in VHV and \n\nHV, MV and SpLV, until 31st December 2013. \n\n \n\nFurthermore, in the end of 2012, it was released on 21st December the Dispatch n\u00ba 16298/2012 \n\n(Figure 91) [84][85]. This document introduced the three fundamental guidelines for DGEG to \n\npromote the electricity market, without prejudice to the role of ERSE in the transmission of \n\ninformation to consumers, including: \n\n \n\n? Promotion of all mechanisms and instruments available to consumers, regarding the \nprotection of their rights; \n\n? Adequacy of how information will be spread throughout the different types of \nconsumers, with a particular emphasis on communication to economically vulnerable \n\nend-users; \n\n? To promote active participation of the citizens during the transition period to the \nliberalised market, in order to exploit every opportunity to reduce electricity bills. \n\n \n\n Thereby, it is also important that the promotion contains information related to: \n\n \n\nFigure 91.

Celebration of electricity supply contract with electricity suppliers in the liberalised \nmarket; \n\n? Electric power contracting in organised markets or through bilateral contracts, in the \ncase of customers with status of a market agent; \n\n? Celebration of electricity supply contract with last resort electricity suppliers, according \nto legal conditions and established regulatory laws. \n\n \n\nWith these measures it was expected to increase the competition within the Portuguese \n\nelectricity sector, reflecting in the level of prices and the improvement in the quality of the \n\nservice, which should lead to greater satisfaction on the part of electricity consumers. \n\n \n\nThe options available for the consumers are vast and different covering whether large \n\nconsumers, industries or small and medium enterprises (SMEs), but in regard to the issue of this \n\nthesis and topic, the focus will be the domestic market segment.  \n\n \n\n? Large consumers: Group of clients whose power plants are connected to VHV and HV \nelectric networks;  \n\n? Industries: Group of clients whose power plants are connected to medium-Voltage \n(MV) electric networks; \n\n? SMEs: Group of clients whose facilities are connected to low-voltage (LV) electric \nnetworks, and the contracted power is higher to 41.4 kW (Special Low Voltage, SpLV); \n\n? Residential: Group of clients whose facilities are connected to LV electric networks, \nand the contracted power is less or equal to 41,4 kW (Standard Low Voltage, StLV). \n\n \n\nIntroduced the big picture regarding the liberalisation process towards the Portuguese open \n\nmarket, it is time to go into detail and understand the steps made until this moment, pointing \n\nalso the legislative initiatives behind it.  \n\n \n\nIn the context of the realisation of the IEM, the adoption of the Third Directive framework \n\n(Directive 2009/72/EC) has brought more changes to Energy Portuguese law including the \n\namendment of the regulatory legislation of the sector. This directive was also supported by the \n\nMemorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which celebrates the agreement \n\nbetween the Portuguese government, the European Central Bank (ECB), the EC and the \n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and states the extinction, for all customers, of regulated \n\nend-user electricity tariffs charged to Portuguese consumers of electricity until the 1st of \n\nJanuary 2013. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n16 Directive 2003/54/EC, which established the 1st of July 2007 for all electricity customers to be able to \n\nfreely choose their supplier. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n141 \n\n \n\nThereby, in order to satisfy the above mentioned documents, a timetable was defined by the \n\nPortuguese government for the progressive extinction of regulated tariffs for end consumers. \n\nThe Decree-Law n\u00ba 75/2012, from 26 of March, establish the framework that allowed the \n\ngradually extinction, by contracted power, of all the regulated tariffs charged to electricity \n\ncustomers with consumption in StLV [84][85]. It also introduced transitional regulatory \n\nmechanisms, that promote for existing customers with regulated tariffs the access to liberalised \n\nmarket, and protection measures for end-users economically vulnerable.  \n\nThe transitional period starts after the day chosen for the extinction of the regulated tariffs, and \n\nthere will be two transitional periods (Figure 93). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 93. Transitional period for the extinction of the regulated tariffs \n\n \n\nDuring this transitional period, applicable to consumers who continue to be supplied by the \n\nLRES, ERSE will continue to set transitional rates every three months. After this period, all the \n\nnew electricity contracts must follow the laws of the free market. To help consumers on their \n\nchange, the transitional regulatory mechanisms includes also the access to all kind of \n\ninformation on the liberalisation process applied to electricity supply, as the different phases of \n\nextinction of regulated rates and corresponding transitional periods or steps to change electricity \n\nsupplier.  \n\n \n\nConcerning the second point, among the protection mechanisms stand out the commercial \n\nrelations, the social tariffs, regulated by ERSE, and lower prices for customers economically \n\nvulnerable. In order to take advantages of these conditions, this type of customer must have a \n\ndeal with last resort electricity suppliers rather than one of the electricity supplier playing in the \n\nfree market. According to Decree-Law n.\u00ba 138-A/2010, from 28th of December, economically \n\nvulnerable consumers are considered to be all those who receive one of the following social \n\nbenefits [84][85]: \n\n \n\n? Income support for the elderly; \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n142 \n\n \n\n? Social insertion income; \n? Unemployment benefit; \n? 1st tier of family allowance; \n? Disability living allowance. \n\n \n\nBasically, the document is the final update of the previous Decree-Law n\u00ba 104/2010, from 29th \n\nof September, which established the end of regulated tariffs to electricity customers with \n\nconsumption in VHV and HV, MV and finally, SpLV17 from the 1st of January 2011[84][85] .  \n\n \n\nAs the Portuguese electricity sector is now a open market and the regulated tariffs will gradually \n\ncome to an end, associated with these changes is the costumer\u2019s responsibility for actively seeks \n\nfor information, regarding to further development of the sector or electricity suppliers\u2019 offers. \n\nThis allows them to understand exactly what these changes imply before changing to a different \n\nsupplier or tariff. But which are the options available in the market? \n\n \n\nAt present, there are seven players competing in the electricity residential market (Figure 94). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 94. Currently electricity supplier companies operating in Portugal  \n\n \n\nAccording to ERSE\u2019s last review [86], published on July 2014, the number of customers in the \n\nopen market in June grew by approximately 63% comparing to same month a year ago, \n\ncorresponding thus to 2 904 130 costumers (Figure 95).    \n\n  \n\n                                                      \n17 Special Low-Voltage (SpLV): LV supply or delivery where contracted power is (i) Mainland Portugal - \ngreater than 41.4 kW, (ii) Autonomous Region of the Azores \u2013 equal to or greater than 20.7 kW and is \n\nachieved by way of maximum power at 15 minute intervals, (iii) Autonomous Region of Madeira greater \n\n62.1 kW). \n\nEDP Comercial\n\nENAT Eletricidade\n\nEndesa\n\nYLCE/Enforcesco\n\nGalp Power\n\nIberdrola\n\nGas Natural Fenosa\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n143 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 95.

Liberalised market characterisation ( consumption) [86] \n\n \n\nIn order to better understand the liberalised market, as well as the process regarding the \n\nextinction of the regulated tariffs, it is also important to make an brief characterisation of the \n\nLRES activity. At the moment the number of clients supplied by a LRES are localised in the \n\nresidential sector, with 98% of the total of customers (Figure 102).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 102. LRES activity characterisation (number of consumers) [86] \n\n \n\nIn relation to the others 0.2%, it is expected to get closer and closer to zero as the consequences \n\nregarding to extinction of regulated tariffs to each sector become gradually effective. Thus, as a \n\nconsequence of this dominant position in the LRES activity, the share of consumption about the \n\nresidential customers is, naturally, above the 90% (Figure 103).     \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n147 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 103.

Because of that, the sector offers more opportunities to electricity suppliers \n\nto capture customers who are still in the regulated market.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 110. Share of each electricity supplier in the residential sector (consumption) [86] \n\n \n\nAnalysing the sector (Figure 110), EDP is the current leading electricity supplier, position \n\nmostly achieved thanks to its historical background as the sole electricity supplier when the \n\nPortuguese electricity market was regulated. Therefore, it is not strange EDP\u2019s unquestionable \n\nshare of 83%.  That means the space for the others competitors is narrow, making thus the \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n151 \n\n \n\ncompetition between them tight as the numbers suggest: Iberdrola (5.3%), Endesa (4.5%), Galp \n\nEnergia (4.2%), Gas Natural Fenosa (3%) and the others (0.3%). \n\n \n\nWith the Portuguese liberalised market characterisation done, it is now time to take a closer \n\nlook to the companies which are operating in the electricity market.  \n\n \n\n5.3.1. EDP Comercial \n\n \n\n \n\nThe EDP Group is among the most powerful and influential European companies acting \n\nnowadays in the electricity sector and can also be considered one of the largest Portuguese \n\neconomic entities, probably as consequence of its historical background.  \n\nTaking this last note, its roots are traced to the period right after the Portuguese Revolution, \n\nwhen the Portuguese government decided to merge all the Portuguese continental companies \n\nregarding to generation, transmission, distribution and electricity supply into a single one. From \n\nthis nationalisation process, and according to the Decree-Law n\u00ba 502/76 EDP \u2013 Electricidade de \n\nPortugal, Empresa P\u00fablica was created in 30th July 1976. Three fundamental challenges were \n\nexpected of this new entity, including: \n\n  \n\n? The electrification of the country; \n? The modernisation and extension of the RNT and RND as well as the planning, \n\ndevelopment and edification of the SEN; \n\n? Establishment of an unique tariff transversal to all customers; \n\n \n\nWith these guidelines behind, in the mid-eighties the EDP\u2019s RND covered 97% of the \n\ncontinental territory of Portugal and guaranteed around 80% of the LV electricity supply [87]. \n\n \n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined to EU and since then the country polities are in hands with the EU \n\nlegislation. Therefore, the 1989 revision of the constitution eliminated much of the \n\nremaining Marxist rhetoric of the original document, abolished the communist-inspired \n\n\"agrarian reform\", and laid the groundwork for privatisation of nationalised firms.  \n\nEDP is one of these examples, and in 1991 was transformed in a anonymous company (S.A) \n\nunder the Decree-Law n\u00ba 7/91, from 8th January, and in 1994 it was formed the EDP Group \n\nafter a deep restructuring process [87].  \n\n \n\nJust focusing on the electricity supply activity, the firm is considered the largest electricity \n\nsupplier in the Portuguese open market and on the other side of the border, is among the top five \n\nplayers.  \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n152 \n\n \n\nRegarding to the Portuguese sector, EDP operates through the name of EDP Comercial while in \n\nSpain the electricity supply activity is performed by EDP-HC Energ\u00eda (ex-Hidrocantabrico \n\nEnergia) [87].   \n\n \n\nBesides its role as EDP Comercial in the open market, the firm also operates as a LRES. \n\nThereby, in Portugal EDP, through EDP Servi\u00e7o Universal, is delegated to supply all customers \n\nwho choose to stay in the regulated market and the electricity needed to ensure the supply of \n\nthese customers is acquired in the market or to SRG18 [87].    \n\n \n\n5.3.2. Iberdrola \n\n \n\n \n\nIberdrola is a Spanish multinational electricity company based in Bilbao, Basque Country, and \n\nis placed right behind Endesa, as the second largest electricity utility company in Spain. The \n\nfirm was formed in April 1991, as a result of the merge between two major private utilities, \n\nHidroelectrica Espa\u00f1a S.A. and Iberduero. The intention behind this joint was to create an \n\nentity that would be able to hold its own in the coming liberalisation of the EU\u2019s power industry \n\n[88]. \n\n \n\nIberdrola\u2019s roots are traced in the beginning of the twenty century, when in July 1901 the \n\nmining engineer Juan Urrutia led a group of entrepreneurs in forming Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Ib\u00e9rica in \n\nBilbao. Meanwhile, civil engineer Jos\u00e9 Orbegozo, at the head of another group of Bilbao-based \n\nentrepreneurs, set up the Sociedad General de Transportes El\u00e9ctricos (SGTE) with the intention \n\nof developing power installations along the international stretch of the river Duero [88].  \n\n \n\nRight after, in 1907 a third company, Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Espa\u00f1ola (Hidrola), was founded with the \n\npurpose to electrify the cities of Madrid and Valencia.  \n\n \n\nAfter some years, SGTE went through a name change, became Saltos de Duero, and five years \n\nafter the end of the Spanish Civil War, in 1944, STGE and Saltos de Duero merged  to form \n\nIberduero. \n\n \n\nIn the early 1990s, the state utility ENDESA, created by the Franco regime in the 1940s, drew \n\nattention to itself with a series of acquisitions. The Spanish government, worried that the \n\nspanish's smaller private utilities would be unable to compete in the coming Europe-wide \n\nmarket, encouraged ENDESA to swallow one small utility after another. To counterbalance \n\nENDESA's growing influence, Hidrola and Iberduero made the decision to merge and the result \n\nwas the creation of Iberdrola [88]. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n18 According to Decree-Law n\u00ba 215-A/2012 the last resort electricity supplier, EDP obligated to purchase \n\nelectricity generated under the Portuguese special regime. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n153 \n\n \n\nIn 1992, the firm started its internationalisation process when established a presence in Latin \n\nAmerica, including for instance Argentina, Bolivia, Chile or Brazil. Moreover, in this new \n\ncentury the firm integrated ScottishPower and Energy East, currently known as Iberdrola USA, \n\nin its group and become a major multinational company, one the five largest electricity \n\ncompanies in the world [88]. \n\n \n\nRegarding to Portugal, the first contact was in 1998 when Iberdrola acquired 80% of Empresa \n\nEl\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala S.A., in alliance with EDP. Some years after, the two firms partnered \n\nwith the italian group Eni, in a deal to acquire a share in Galp Energia [88]. In relation to \n\nelectricity market, Iberdrola is active in the sector since 2002.  \n\n \n\n5.3.3. ENAT Electricidade \n\n \n\n \n\nENAT \u2013 Energias Naturais, through ENAT Eletricidade, is also another national firm acting in \n\nthe Portuguese liberalised market.  \n\nLooking back at the history of ENAT, the company was born in the interior of Portugal, more \n\nexactly in Castelo Branco, and started its activity in the renewable energy market in 2004. At \n\nthe moment, ENAT services are spread all over the national territory, with offices in Lisbon, \n\nOporto, Castelo Branco, Viseu, Beja, Algarve, among others regions [89].  \n\nHowever, pointing to more ambitious goals, in 2012 ENAT saw a window of opportunity in the \n\nelectricity open market, and since November 2013 the firm included in its portfolio the \n\nelectricity supply activity being thus from that moment, one more option to all residential \n\ncustomers who are in the electricity liberalised market [89]. \n\nThe first customer to sign ENAT services came right after, in Castro Verde, followed by others \n\nin Castelo Branco and then all over the country. At the present, ENAT provides is services to \n\napproximately 2000 customers [90]. \n\n \n\nRegarding to ENAT offers, they do not have a retention period, which means the customer may \n\nquit is deal anytime, without penalty fee. Besides that, and according to its directors, the firm \n\ndiffers from the large companies by having a closer customer service and prices more accessible \n\n[89]. \n\n \n\n5.3.4. Endesa \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n154 \n\n \n\n \n\nIf EDP is leading the Portuguese electricity market, it is also reasonable to say the largest \n\noperator in Spain is Endesa. Actually, these firms are fighting for the supremacy of the Iberian \n\nelectricity market.  \n\n \n\nEndesa\u2019s history is quite similar to EDP once the firm, since the time of its foundation in 1944, \n\nwas linked to the Spanish government. In fact, the firm on that time was 98% owned by \n\nInstituto Nacional de Industria (INI). INI was the state parent company, which owned all the \n\npower firms controlled by the Spanish government, including Empresa Nacional Hidro-\n\nElectrica del Ribagorzana (ENHER), General Europea S.A. (GESA), Union Electrica de \n\nCanarias S.A. (UNELCO), Empresa Nacional Electrica de Cordoba (ENECO) and ENDESA. \n\nHowever, the things changed and in 1983, as part of the government general plan to make INI \n\nmore efficient and modernise the country\u2019s institutions in order to prepare the Spanish entry in \n\nthe EC, all the companies under INI control were transferred to ENDESA\u2019s authority. Since this \n\nreorganisation the firm has enjoyed a phenomenal growth and became the country\u2019s largest \n\nelectricity producer. As a result of a couple more deregulations and changes over the eighties \n\nand nineties, the company achieved the full privatisation in 1998 [91][92].  \n\n \n\nOut of majority government control for the first time, the company continued with its \n\nrestructuring plan, which had started in 1999, so that it could compete effectively in a \n\nderegulated market [91].  \n\nUnder this restructuring plan, ENDESA created ENDESA Servicios, ENDESA Generaci\u00f3n, and \n\nENDESA Distribuci\u00f3n to oversee its internal needs, electricity production, and electricity \n\ndistribution, respectively [92]. \n\n \n\nIn Portugal, the Endesa Energia was the first electricity supplier in the Portuguese open market \n\nin April 2000. Two years late, ENDESA created Sodesa - Energy Trading SA, an even shared \n\njoint venture with the Portuguese group Sonae, with the aim of supply electricity and marketing \n\nservices for Portuguese electricity customers in the liberalised market. However, the firm \n\nabandoned the open market in 2007 due to the unfavourable regulatory framework, and decided \n\nto come back when ERSE have set new rates for 2009, which the company considered \n\nattractive. \n\nTherefore, in January 2009, Endesa began a new step in the Portuguese electricity market when \n\nthey come up with its own electricity supply company: Endesa Energia.  \n\n \n\n5.3.5. YLCE/Enforcesco \n\n \n\n \n\nFounded as a spin-off of Enforce, Enforcesco S.A. is the most recent electricity supplier in the \n\nPortuguese electricity market. With is headquarters in Castelo Branco, more specifically in \n\nCovilh\u00e3, Enforcesco came up one year ago with the brand YLCE - Yes, Low-Cost Energy, to \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n155 \n\n \n\nmaterialize this new company business framework. Therefore, according to Jo\u00e3o Nuno Serra, \n\nEnforcesco\u2019s CEO,  through YLCE it is Enforcesco\u2019s main intention to operate, gradually, in \n\nthe European energy market after 2015, period in which the firm plans to have already a solid \n\nrole in the Portuguese open market [93][94]. \n\n \n\nRight now the firm has more than 1000 customers, independently of the size and type, and this \n\nis possible thanks to some advantages intrinsic to a low-cost company, including the low \n\noperational costs and the use of information and communication technologies optimising then \n\nall the business and relation process with customer. According to Enforcesco\u2019s CEO, summing \n\nall elements it results in a lower and attractive price to the final user, comparing to the \n\ncompetition [93][94].  \n\n \n\n5.3.6. Galp Power \n\n \n\n \n\nWith three centuries of existence, Galp Energia, through the name of Galp Electricidade, is \n\nanother agent operating in the electricity liberalised market. Despite in 2007, the firm\u2019s efforts \n\nwere the business and industrial customers, particularly those who were already customers, in \n\n2012 there was an extension of electricity supply to residential customers [95]. \n\n \n\nThe first historical data of the company is from 26th August 1846. It is on this date that Queen \n\nMaria II authorised the opening of a competition to lighting the Lisbon by means of hydrogen \n\ngas, an event that would lead to the establishment of Companhia Lisbonense de Ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nG\u00e1s (CLIG). Two years after, it was lightened the firsts gas-fired lamps in Lisbon and that \n\nmoment can be remembered as the birth of Galp Energia. From that event, it was a click to \n\npetroleum and natural gas technologies [95]. \n\n \n\nGalp Energia was established on 22 April 1999 under the name of GALP - Petr\u00f3leos e G\u00e1s de \n\nPortugal, SGPS, S.A., resulting of a merger between Petrogal, Portugal's sole refiner and the \n\nmain distributor of oil products, and GDP - G\u00e1s de Portugal, the company importing natural gas \n\ninto Portugal and transporting and distributing it domestically [95].  \n\n \n\nExploring these companies, Petrogal was formed in 1976 from the merger of four Portuguese \n\noil companies: Sonap, Sacor, Cidla and Petrosur, while GDP is the former Sociedade \n\nPortuguesa de Petroqu\u00edmicos created in 1957 by Sacor and and CRGE, which are the merger \n\nbetween CLIG  and Companhia Gaz de Lisboa [95]. \n\n  \n\nCurrently Galp Energia is the leading integrated company of petroleum products and natural gas \n\nin Portugal and aims, through Galp Power, to be a solid option in the Portuguese electricity \n\nmarket as well.  \n\n \n\n5.3.7. Gas Natural Fenosa \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n156 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOperating at the moment in 25 countries, Gas Natural Fenosa is the last but not least \n\nmultinational company with activity in the Portuguese liberalised electricity market.  \n\n \n\nWith a background history similar to Galp Energia, under the name of Sociedad Catalana para \n\nel Alumbrado por Gas (SCAG), Gas Natural Fenosa was the first company to bring light to \n\nstreets and public spaces in Barcelona, thus offering the first public service implemented in the \n\ncity, in 1843 [96].  \n\n \n\nFrom 1866, SCAG made a leap beyond the Catalonian territory and began geographical \n\nexpansion throughout Spain with the purchase of some gas factories, as well as beginning to \n\nbuild factories of its own. At the end of the century, SCAG also entered into the business of \n\nthermal electricity and in 1911, hydroelectric power and one year later, the company changed its \n\nname to Catalana de Gas y Electricidad, S.A. (CGE), in order to incorporate the electricity \n\nactivity in the company strategy [96]. \n\n \n\n1963 is the period that one of the greatest milestones in the firm was achieved, when \n\nCGE introduced petrol in the Spanish energy market, using it as a raw material to replace \n\ncoal. At the end of the decade, Gas Natural S.A., a joint venture between CGE and Exxon, \n\nbegan the era of natural gas in Spain, mainly through the establishment of natural gas supply \n\ncontracts with countries of Maghreb, among others events [96]. \n\n \n\nIn 1987, CGE changed its name to Catalana de Gas S.A (CdG) and sold its conventional \n\nelectricity shares. Five years later, in 1991, CdG merged with Gas Madrid, S.A. and \n\nabsorbed different gas pipeline shares from Repsol, thus integrating the gas sector in Spain. The \n\nmerger led to a new change of company name, becoming Gas Natural SDG [96].  \n\n \n\nIn 1992, Gas Natural SDG started its international expansion with the acquisition of assets in \n\nArgentina, and the incorporation of Gas Natural BAN. Five years later, it continued advancing \n\nthroughout the South American territory to begin new activities in Brazil, Colombia and \n\nMexico.  \n\nThe group\u2019s solidity continued to consolidate when in 2002 it expanded into the Italian energy \n\nmarket. From then, and with the beginning of activities in Puerto Rico and France, the \n\ncompany's international expansion process has been unstoppable up to the point of \n\nreaching more than 25 countries worldwide, including Australia, South Africa, Oman, the \n\nDominican Republic, Guatemala, Belgium and Germany [96]. \n\n \n\nOne of the great turning points that transformed the group's history was the merger by \n\nabsorption with Uni\u00f3n Fenosa and Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Generaci\u00f3n, in 2008, which resulted in \n\nthe first integrated gas and electricity company in Spain, as well as in Latin America: Gas \n\nNatural Fenosa.  \n\nhttp://www.gasnaturalfenosa.es/es/inicio/somos+energia/mas+que+gas+y+electricidad/que+hacemos/1297101436266/en+el+mundo.html\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n157 \n\n \n\nWith the integration of the two companies, the group became even stronger, more efficient and \n\nmore competitive and it is today one of the top 10 leading European firms in the energy \n\nbusiness [96]. \n\n \n\nIn Portugal, Gas Natural Fenosa operates in the liberalised electricity market through Uni\u00f3n \n\nFenosa Comercial. Basically, Gas Natural Fenosa only took advantage of Uni\u00f3n Fenosa\u2019s \n\nconsolidated deployment in the Portuguese market previously to the company\u2019s acquisition, \n\nonce the firm had been operating as an electricity supplier in the Portuguese market since 2004 \n\n[96].  \n\n \n\nThere are different aspects a consumer must be aware in the time to choose its electricity \n\nsupplier in order to reduce the electricity bill, like the current household energy consumption, \n\nreliability and the rating of customer service provided by the electricity supplier, or even the \n\nterms of a contract. However, there are also two important parameters: \n\n \n\n? The cost of electricity: tariff rates of each electricity supplier; \n? Environmental impact: the percentage of electricity each electricity supplier generates \n\nfrom RES; \n\n \n\nDespite the possible advantage of being a social company, these are the two aspects a RES \n\nCooperative, as Coop\u00e9rnico, can use to make the difference in the electricity retailing business.  \n\n \n\nBut what is Coop\u00e9rnico, its roots and how can a social company enter in this competitive world? \n\nThus, with a general description of the Portuguese liberalised market, as well as the main \n\nplayers operating in the residential market, it is time to answer to these questions right away. \n\n \n\n5.3.8. The incoming of a new player: Coop\u00e9rnico \n\n \n\n \n\nInspired by the success model of several European RES Cooperatives, Coop\u00e9rnico is the first \n\nRES Cooperative in Portugal and it was founded in late 2013, by a group of 16 people from \n\ndifferent areas and with different professional backgrounds sharing the vision of a fair and \n\nresponsible renewable energy model that may contributes to a social, environmental and \n\nsustainable energy future (Figure 111). \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n158 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 111.

Coop\u00e9rnico objectives for the beginning of each year \n\n \n\nThus, in the context of the process towards the full liberalisation of the Portuguese electricity \n\nmarket, Coop\u00e9rnico aims to be the hub for people and organisations wishing to create a new \n\nenergetic paradigm, mainly through (Figure 113):  \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n159 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 113. Economic activities and organisational structures of Coop\u00e9rnico \n\n \n\nRegarding to the first economic activity, Coop\u00e9rnico invests through equity interest in solutions \n\nfor decentralised RES generation. These societies may be related, or not, to the Cooperative. At \n\npresent, there are four projects already in activity and two more in development.  \n\nStill in the same branch, Coop\u00e9rnico also offers services of consulting and advising to potential \n\nstakeholders in this activity. \n\n \n\nIn respect to the electricity supply activity, the Cooperative proposes to be able to provide the \n\n100% electricity supply based on RES to all LV customers (citizens, businesses firms and other \n\nstakeholders). \n\n \n\nLinked to its global strategy, and in addition to their economic activities, Coop\u00e9rnico has also an \n\norganisational structure comprised in three pillars. \n\n \n\nTherefore, aiming to promote the Cooperative in the national territory, as well as the progressive \n\nenvironmental and energy awareness among its citizens, Coop\u00e9rnico wants to invest in the \n\ncreation and propagation of Regional Centres throughout the country. All these poles will be \n\noverseen by a central organ, whose functions will be the definition of the requirements needed \n\nto create new Regional Centres, the monitoring of its creation and development, as well as the \n\ncoordination of all activities executed by Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s Regional Centres. Currently is already in \n\nactivity the Regional Centre of Oporto and being in launch phase the Regional Centre of Braga. \n\n \n\nMoreover, Coop\u00e9rnico also proposes to support the use of RES and the promotion of energy \n\nefficiency tips to the Cooperative members, as well as the development of guidelines regarding \n\nenergy saving measures to be applied for all the establishments where there are or will be \n\ninstalled projects. \n\n \n\nEconomic \nactivities\n\nRES generation\n\nService of \ngreen \n\nelectricity \nsupply\n\nOrganisational \nstructures\n\nRegional \nCentres and \n\nLocal Initiatives\n\nServices to \nmembers\n\nWorking \ngroups\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n160 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 114.

This working \n\ngroup will also focus on the establishment of partnerships with industry or academic \n\ninstitutions, to study and developing new RES generation projects. \n\n \n\nAdopted a model that combines economic and environmental benefits to social solidarity, \n\nCoop\u00e9rnico also assumes the commitment to promote social or educational activities, ensuring \n\nthen the involvement of its own members and partners in these activities, as well as the \n\ncommitment to invest in local development, whenever the Cooperative intends to implement a \n\ngiven project. \n\n \n\nIn order to meet its members and the Portuguese society in general, it is also essential to \n\nestablish a group that manages the Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s image, as well as the organisation of the \n\nCooperative events, such as General Meeting, newsletters, communications to members or \n\npromotional campaigns relating to the Cooperative. \n\n \n\nIt is also expected that another group can be responsible for the development of a manual that \n\nsummarises all the rules of conduct and management of Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s activities, such as hiring, \n\nworking members\u2019 remuneration and rules for the holding of General Meeting, among others. \n\n \n\nRegarding to \u201cRetailing\u201d working group, it is proposed that this group be responsible for \n\nmonitoring the MIBEL, in order to anticipate future changes in the market development. Thus, \n\nbased on this monitoring, Coop\u00e9rnico intends to come up with innovative strategic solutions \n\nthat can not only consolidate Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s evolution within the MIBEL, but also to protect the \n\ninterests of its members. \n\n \n\nAll those who purchase at least three titles in capital in the amount of \u20ac 60 are accepted as \n\nmembers by the board of directors. At the moment, Coop\u00e9rnico has four different types of \n\nmembership (Figure 115): \n\nScouting, Areas \nof Activity, \nInnovation\n\nEnvironmental \nEducation\n\nCommunication \nand Events \n\nmanagement\n\nGovernance Retailing\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n161 \n\n \n\n \n\n?

Operation of the Iberian Electricity Market \n\nOne of the natural consequences of the First Directive in Southern Europe was the conceiving of \n\nthe Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). However, this natural response of the Iberian countries \n\nwas not done overnight. In fact, took almost 10 years to be 100% launched. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n165 \n\n \n\n \n\nTraveling around the history of MIBEL, it all commenced in 1998, period wherein the \n\nPortuguese and Spanish governments started debates and conducted research studies in order to \n\nincreasingly dismantle the barriers and encourage the establishment of the MIBEL. \n\n  \n\nAccording to MIBEL website [97], since then, a number of events took place, including the \n\njoint of both electrical systems that was formally initiated with the signing of the \"Protocol for \n\ncollaboration between the Portuguese and Spanish Administrations for the formation of an \n\nIberian Electricity Market\", in November 2001. \n\nIn that document, it was established between the two countries the foundations necessary to \n\nbegin cooperation among the many entities with responsibilities in the sector framework \n\n(administrations, regulators and operators), with a view to harmonising the participation \n\nconditions of economic agents on MIBEL. \n\n \n\nIn the context of the XVIII Portuguese-Spanish Summit, in October 2002, the organisational \n\nmodel for MIBEL was decided as well as the main objectives for its materialisation, adopting as \n\na strategy for its creation an intermediary regional approach of the integration of the Portuguese \n\nand Spanish markets into a single European market.  \n\nThis organisational model is based on the existence of the Iberian Market Operator (OMI), \n\nowned in even share by both governments, with two poles: \n\n \n\n? The Portuguese division, responsible for the management of the derivate markets; \n? The Spanish division, responsible for the management of day and intraday markets.  \n\n \n\nThe same summit also states that the model shall follow a phased building model, based on \n\nthree main pillars (Figure 120): \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 120. The three main ideas behind the MIBEL organisational model, set by both governments in the \n\nXVIII Portuguese-Spanish Summit \n\n \n\nOn year later, at the XIX Portuguese-Spanish Summit, both governments signed a Memorandum \n\nof Understanding relative to the necessary conditions to complete MIBEL, including a timetable \n\npredicting all the steps to achieve this Iberian Electricity Market. \n\nHarmomisation of the economic conditions of participating on the market, through\nthe convergence of procedures to define fees, competitor transition costs, access\nconditions to the interconnections, degree of openess and the formation of OMI.\n\nHarmonisation of legal and regulatory framework of the economic conditions for\nparticipating on MIBEL and of the systems operational procedures.\n\nEstablishing a phsysical support plataform for the Iberian regional market,\nsupported by the development of transport infrastructures and the articulation of\nenergetic planning and transport networks.\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n166 \n\n \n\nBesides the timetable, the signing of an International Agreement was also foreseen, which \n\nwould formalise the creation of MIBEL. This marked the official launch of the integration of the \n\nPortuguese and Spanish electricity systems.  \n\n \n\nThus, it did not took too long to the sign of a document contained a plan for the integration of \n\nboth electricity markets. The \u201cAgreement between the Portuguese Republic and the Kingdom of \n\nSpain for the Constitution of an Iberian Electrical Energy Market\u201d signed in 2004, consolidated \n\nthe foundations for the construction of a common market, outlining the general development of \n\nthe project, not just at a legislative and regulatory level but also the market\u2019s operational \n\nsolutions, including: \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 121. General foundations for the construction of a common market, set by both governments in the \n\nXIX Portuguese-Spanish Summit \n\n \n\nUnder the terms of this agreement (Figure 121), the launch of MIBEL and the start of the \n\nintegrated working of the two MIBEL divisions should have happened in the same year.  \n\nHowever, due to some circumstances of political and legal nature the schedule was postponed.  \n\n \n\nTaking advantage of this postponement, the two governments decided to review the MIBEL \n\nconstitution project, which was formalised with the signing of a new International Agreement \n\nstill in the year 2004, under the scope of the XX Portuguese-Spanish Summit.  \n\nThis new agreement covered topic such as (Figure 122): \n\nEstablishment of two divisons\n\n(responsible for the management of the organised markets, before the creation of \nOMI)\n\nOMEL (Spanish division), responsible for \nthe management of the day and intraday \n\nmarket.\n\nOMIP (Portuguese division), responsible \nfor the management of the derivative \n\nmarkets.\n\nReciprocal recognition of agents\n\nIf an agent were granted the status of generator, marketer or other, by one country, \nthis would imply automatic recognition by the other country, granting equal rights \n\nand obligations to that agent.\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n167 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 122. Topics covered by the new agreement, set by both governments in the XX Portuguese-Spanish \n\nSummit  \n\n \n\nThus, the new agreement decided that the launch of MIBEL would take place until 30th June \n\n2005. \n\n \n\nHowever, the expected difficulties in overcoming the pre-launch period were aggravated once \n\nagain due to political and legal factors that would not permit the official launch of MIBEL in the \n\nschedule previously foreseen. Among these setbacks were: \n\n \n\n? Significant political changes in Portugal, with the election of a new government, which \nonly came into power in March 2005; \n\n? This fact led to the lack of legal developments needed to launch OMIP; \n? Uncertainties in MIBEL\u2019s regulatory framework led to the construction of a \u201cWhite \n\nBook\u201d on the electrical sector, and its impact on the organisational and working model \n\nof MIBEL. \n\n \n\nIn 2005, at the XXI Portuguese-Spanish Summit, both governments reinforce their commitment \n\nto building the MIBEL, agreeing that the following steps would be taken, during 2006 (Figure \n\n123): \n\n \n\nObligates the parties \nto develop the \n\nlegislation needed for \nthe running of MIBEL\n\nEstablishes the trend \ntowards tariff \nharmonisation\n\nEstablishes which \nentities can act on \n\nMIBEL\n\nFormalises the \nconstitution of a \n\nsingle Iberian Market \nOperator (OMI)\n\nEstablishes limits to \nthe company \n\norganisation of the \nmarket operators\n\nForesees the \nexistence of financing \nmeans of the Market \nOperators, namely by \n\nthe tariff\n\nDefines the \ncontractual modes on \n\nMIBEL\n\nForesees the adoption \nof measures to \n\npromote liquidity and \ncompetition on MIBEL\n\nEstablishes the power of the MIBEL's \nRegulatory Board, the Market Agent \nCommittee and the MIBEL Economic \n\nand Technical Management \nCommittee\n\nDefines the means for \nregulation, consultation, \n\nsupervision and \nmanagement of MIBEL\n\nDefines the legal \nregime relative to \n\ninfringements, \nsanctions and \n\ncompetent jurisdiction\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n168 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 123.

Operators and Trading Members at MIBEL \n\nAs said before, the MIBEL agreement provides that the current Portuguese and Spanish market \n\noperators will be merged into a single Iberian market operator that will operate with two \n\ninterconnected centres in Lisbon and Madrid.  \n\nWhilst this does not happen, at the moment MIBEL is operated by three distinct companies: \n\n \n\n? OMIE: The Spanish division of the Iberian Energy Market Operator, which is \nresponsible for the spot electricity market with daily transactions and intraday \n\nadjustments (intraday markets), wherein electricity sale (production) and purchase \n\nprogrammes are established for the day following that of the trade.  \n\n? OMIP: The Portuguese division of the Iberian Energy Market Operator, that ensures \nthe management of the MIBEL futures market in Portugal and is currently a regulated \n\nmarket.  \n? OMIClear: The Clearing Platform for the Iberian Forward/Derivatives Markets, which \n\nacts as a clearing house, central counterparty and managing entity of the settlement \n\nsystem. Fundamentally, its main activity is that of clearing, registration, risk \n\nmanagement and the settlement of transactions traded on the OMIP.  \n\n \n\nIn spite of the successive restrictions on participatory interests in the managing companies of \n\nthe market operators, imposed by the transitional period regime, the technical system operation \n\nof the markets is still assured by the two companies responsible for the management of the \n\nIberian transmission networks: REE and REN, respectively.  \n\nIt is also important to say, in name of transparency on the business, that none of the five \n\nprevious companies buy nor sell electricity (Figure 127). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 127.

Electricity power producers; \n? Resellers; \n? Qualified direct consumers in the market; \n? Representatives. \n\n \n\nIn order to operate on the market managed by OMIE, buying and selling electricity, the RES \n\nCooperative must comply with several preliminary and complex requirements established in the \n\nregulations that can be identified in OMIE\u2019s website [98].  \n\nAccording to OMIE Market Access Guide (OMAG)[99], the first step of the process begins with \n\nthe activation of the local Energy Identification Code (EIC19).  \n\nThis activation is carried out through a request submitted to any Local Issuing Office (LIO). In \n\nthe case of Coop\u00e9rnico, the EIC code is supplied and administered by the Portuguese LIO: \n\nREN.  \n\n \n\nHowever, in order to achieve the EIC code it is important to have initiated the request of the \n\nstatus of Market Agent. Why? Because the RES Cooperative must provide the code of Agent in \n\nOMIE (5 characters). This code of Agent in OMIE will be a constituent part of the local EIC \n\ncode to be issued by REN.   \n\nThe allocation of an EIC code to a market participant is broken down into three main steps: \n\n \n\n? Submission by the market participant: the RES Cooperative applies to REN for a \nEIC code; \n\n? Validation and allocation: REN validates the credentials of the RES Cooperative and \nallocates the code; \n\n? Verification and Integration: REN publishes the allocated EIC code on its LIO web \npage.    \n\n \n\nThere is no financial cost on the activation of the EIC code.  \n\n \n\nOnce the EIC code is obtained, the second step of the process is an electronic procedure (Figure \n\n128), through which the information required for acquiring the status of market agent is \n\nprovided to OMIE. This electronic process is divided into two phases: \n\n \n\n                                                      \n19 The EIC code is the easiest and most reliable way to identify the market participants and other entities \n\nactive within the European IEM. The EIC coding scheme is maintained by the European Network of \n\nTransmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n173 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 128. General description regarding the two phases of the electronic procedure \n\n \n\nAs part of the first phase of the electronic process, there is some required extra information \n\n(written hard copies of additional documents) that must be referred to OMIE: \n\n \n\n? Copy of the document issued by the Tax Agency certifying the Tax identification \nNumber (VAT or NIF, in Portuguese) of the RES Cooperative or the Representative \n\nAgent.  \n\n? Copy of the National Identity Card (BI, in Portuguese) of the person signing the request, \n(person included on the form as the entity\u2019s representative, who must have sufficient \n\npowers for conducting all the acts and signing all the documents required for the \n\ncomplete adhesion of the requester, or his clients to the Market).  \n\n \n\nAfter activating the EIC code, it is time to go straight to the first phase of the electronic \n\nprocedure (Agent Registration Form). Within the first phase, the RES Cooperative must define \n\nbetween two options which one will choose for purchasing electricity in the market: \n\n \n\n? Being a Market Agent; \n? Access to the market through a Representative Agent. \n\n \n\nAs the process is different depending on the option considered, it is important to analyse each \n\none independently. \n\n \n\nBeing a Market Agent: \n\n \n\nThus, after the first phase of the electronic process is carried out (Figure 129): \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n174 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 129.

Proceeding after the second phase of the electronic process \n\n \n\nOnce all the information received through the electronic forms has been verified and the hard \n\ncopies have also been received and verified, OMIE notify the completion of the process and the \n\nacquiring of the Market Agent status by the RES Cooperative. \n\n \n\nAccess to the market through a Representative Agent: \n\n \n\nIn this case, the process is simpler for the RES Cooperative\u2019s side. Basically, the Representative \n\nAgent is responsible for the whole process, as it\u2019s explained below. \n\n \n\nTherefore, after activating the EIC code, the RES Cooperative only have to indicate in the Agent \n\nRegistration Form that is going to access the Market through a Representative Agent.  \n\n \n\nRegarding the Representative Agent, it shall provide a paper copy of the authorisation of said \n\nrepresentation, based on Form V and VII included in OMAG, which consists of the \n\naccreditation of the granting of sufficient powers so that the applicant company can act as \n\nrepresentative for the RES Cooperative.   \n\nThe Representative Agent is also responsible for sending the written copies of the required \n\ndocumentation to OMIE. \n\nAssessment of the documentation submitted\n\nOMIE accepts the electronic request\n\nThen, it is send an e-mail containing the adhesion contract \n\nTwo copies of the file must be print and each of its pages \nsigned\n\nSending both copies to OMIE for signing\n\nThen, one of the hard copies is returned to Coop\u00e9rnico \nwhile the other remains in OMIE\u2019s possession\n\nNevertheless, this copy is simply another requirement \nwithin the process for accessing the market\n\n(not \u201cper se\u201d entails obtaining the status as market agent)\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n176 \n\n \n\n \n\nMoreover, the Representative Agent shall fill out the different electronic forms to enter the \n\ninformation associated with the RES Cooperative. The entire process is carried out through the \n\nMarket Web Agents Data Maintenance application in the OMIE\u2019s Market Agent Website. \n\nAmong the data to be electronically filled out, it is included the RES Cooperative\u2019s bank \n\naccount data that can be represented between two options: \n\n \n\n? \u201cIn the name and for the account of third parties\u201d: It\u2019s the account used by OMIE to \npay the RES Cooperative directly; \n\n? \u201cIn its own name and for the account of third parties\u201d: It\u2019s the backup account \nexclusively used in the case that the Representative Agent-RES Cooperative \n\nrelationship is terminated. \n\n \n\nOnce all the electronic forms have been completed and the required documentation has been \n\nreceived at OMIE, the RES Cooperative is registered as a new agent. \n\n \n\nIn order to operate in OMIE, the RES Cooperative must provide a financial warranty that would \n\ncover its bids for the next market session, as well as the payment obligations related to the RES \n\nCooperative\u2019s energy purchases until they are paid.  \n\nMoreover, the financial warranty depends on the RES Cooperative\u2019s customer portfolio and its \n\nenergy demand forecasting. That means, the RES Cooperative is free to place on the market the \n\namount of money that it decides according to its forecasts. However, in case the RES \n\nCooperative does not have the minimum financial warranty to cover the bids, its purchases will \n\nbe automatically rejected in the matching process. \n\n \n\nIn relation to Coop\u00e9rnico, at the moment the RES Cooperative does not have the appropriate \n\nhuman, technical and operational resources and know-how to perform directly in OMIE, but the \n\nmain issue is the estimated financial warranty20: \u20ac 550,000.  \n\nThis total value of guarantee to be paid is based on the expected customer portfolio (3000 \n\ncustomers) and their energy demands (9000 MWh), with a maximum expected purchase bid \n\nprice of 70 \u20ac/MWh.  \n\nMoreover, it is important to have a minimum amount of working capital. Based on the estimated \n\nenergy demands (9000 MWh), and considering an applicable daily market estimated price of \n\n55\u20ac/MWh, Coop\u00e9rnico needs to have every month approximately \u20ac 41,000 to purchase in \n\nadvance the required energy demand for the next market session.    \n\nAs it is possible to identify the amount of financial capital required is unbearable. Even \n\nconsidering a loan of \u20ac 550,000 from a bank with an interest rate of 5%, the annual cost for \n\nCoop\u00e9rnico would be \u20ac 27,500 plus the \u20ac 41,000 every month. \n\n  \n\nFor the aforementioned reasons, added to the uncertainty regarding the number of customers \n\nand its energy demands for at least the first two years of operation, the \u201cAccess to the market \n\nthrough a Representative Agent\u201d option seems the most reasonable choice for now. \n\n                                                      \n20 The amount of payment guarantees was calculated according to the expected energy demand and sales, \n\nthrough the simulator available in the public site of OMIE [98]. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n177 \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is important to underline too, that such uncertainty in the numbers may lead to additional fees \n\nfor the RES Cooperative. For instance, if consumers need more energy than the amount that the \n\nRES Cooperative buys, the Cooperative has to pay an extra fee for the energy consumed. The \n\nopposite is also true, if the RES Cooperative\u2019s consumers do not use all the energy bought, the \n\nCooperative has also to pay an extra fee. \n\nDespite the many forecasting solutions available, the energy markets are becoming increasingly \n\ncomplex. If even mature companies have trouble to know exactly how much energy they are \n\ngoing to need in advance, the scenario for the Coop\u00e9rnico does not look very encouraging. \n\nThus, the RES Cooperative\u2019s access to the market can be done by two types of possible \n\nagreements with a Representative Agent:  \n\n \n\n? Via Broker: The RES Cooperative indicates the needs of their customers and these are \nbought by the Broker.  \n\nIn this option, the adjustments and settlements are made directly by the Cooperative. \n\nThe Broker is only in charge of buying the desired electricity volume without assuming \n\nany responsibility. \n\n? Via Business Process Outsourcing (BPO):  The transactions are undertaken based on \nan \"outsourcing\" methodology. \n\nThus, the Representative Agent assumes not only the responsibility of buying the \n\nelectricity needs of the RES Cooperative\u2019s customers but the settlement of any \n\nadjustments, on the opposite of the first option.  \n\n \n\nObviously, the BPO agreement implies lower margins for the RES Cooperative but ensures the \n\noutsourcing of the risk of operating in the market. \n\n \n\n5.5. Conditions for access the transmission and distribution networks \n\nConsidering the RES Cooperative\u2019s eventual success for accessing to OMIE, the next natural \n\nstep is to take the electricity purchased in the market to its customers. However, as it does not \n\nown any grid, the RES Cooperative shall also access the transmission and distribution networks, \n\nincluding the access to the energy market information system, through license agreements. \n\n \n\n5.5.1. Transmission network \u2013 REN \n\nAs the RNT is done by REN, under a concession granted by the Portuguese government in the \n\nform of a public service provided exclusively, the RES Cooperative shall celebrate a license \n\nagreement with them. \n\nAs a TSO, REN is responsible for the Overall Management of the System (GGS) which \n\nincludes [100]: \n\n \n\n? The systemic coordination of infrastructures which make up the SEN, which ensures its \nfull and balanced operation and the security and continuity of supply of electrical \n\npower; \n\n? The management of Ancillary Services through the operationalization of an Ancillary \nServices Market and the contracting of Ancillary Services following prior approval by \n\nERSE; \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n178 \n\n \n\n? Management of the power guarantee mechanism in accordance with current legislation; \n? Settlement for transactions made within the scope of this activity, including imbalances \n\nsettlement; \n\n? The reception of information from Market Agents which are members of organised \nmarkets or which are contracting parties in bilateral contracts, on facts liable to \n\ninfluence the regular operation of the market or the setting of prices in accordance with \n\nCommercial Relation Regulations for the Electricity Sector.  \n\n \n\nAccording to the manual of procedures of the GGS [101], available in REN website, the RES \n\nCooperative shall obtain the status of Market Agent in order to negotiate electricity through \n\nbilateral contracts, participate in the organised markets and in the Ancillary Services Market. By \n\nother words, become Market Agent within the GGS, and thus having the access to the energy \n\nmarket information system. \n\nThe elements required for the celebration of the adhesion contract with the REN are: \n\n \n\n? The application for registration as a Market Agent (forward to REN). This document \nshall be requested to REN; \n\n? The access code to the permanent certificate of business registration, plus the \nidentification of the Conservatory where it was done; \n\n? Identification of the persons responsible for the relationship with the GGS, as well as \ntheir contacts; \n\n? Required information for the effect of Settlement and Billing; \n\n \n\nIn relation to the last two points, the procedures and forms can be also found in REN website. \n\nMoreover, it is also required the authenticated copy of the registration of electricity supplier \n\nissued by DGEG.  \n\nDelivered the application, there is a set of events that may be compiled in the following figure: \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 132. Proceeding after delivery of the request \n\nREN assess the documentation and issues, within 5 working days, \nCoop\u00e9rnico the potencial need for further information\n\nThe Coop\u00e9rnico has 15 days after the notification to provide the extra \ndocumentation\n\nAfter delivery of the documentation and verification of their \ncompliance, the REN emits a contract in duplicate, which must be \n\nsigned and returned\n\nThe Coop\u00e9rnico has 20 working days after reception of the contract, \nto return the contract lest the process be canceled \n\nThe REN provides to Coop\u00e9rnico the status of Market Agent (via an \naccess code)\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n179 \n\n \n\n \n\nAt the same time, it will be generated another document related to the financial warranties, \n\nwhose signature shall be certified by a lawyer or notary. For the purpose of deviations and \n\nadditional costs associated with the GGS, the RES Cooperative must provide a financial \n\nwarranty of \u20ac 50,000. Considering a loan of \u20ac 50,000 from a bank with an interest rate of 5%, \n\nthe annual cost for Coop\u00e9rnico would be \u20ac 2,500. \n\nThe warranty may increase due to changes in the load profile of any transmission system \n\nfacility, production facility directly connected to the transmission system or that may directly \n\ninfluence on the functioning of the transmission system and any distribution or customer \n\nfacilities directly connected to the transmission system. Moreover, the ability to control the \n\ndeviation level, as well as the number of clients supplied by the RES Cooperative may also \n\ninfluence the amount of the financial warranty.  \n\n \n\n5.5.2. Distribution network \u2013 EDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nBesides the access to the transmission network (becoming Market Agent within the GGS)[101],  \n\nthe RES Cooperative shall also celebrate a license agreement with the DSO operator, EDP \n\nDistribui\u00e7\u00e3o, which integrates general conditions approved by ERSE21, as well as particular \n\nconditions defined by the DSO.  \n\nWhilst the particular conditions must be requested to the EDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, in relation to the \n\nERSE conditions they can be found in the Dispatch n\u00ba18899/2010 and in EDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nwebsite [102].  \n\n \n\nIt is of outmost importance to understand the impossibility to carry out both agreements with \n\nREN and EDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, simultaneously. That means to complete this final step, it is \n\nmandatory to have already fulfilled the registration as a Market Agent within the GGS, with the \n\ncelebration of the accession agreement to the energy market information system.  \n\nAs in the previous point, in this case the RES Cooperative must be also in possession of the \n\nregistration of electricity supplier issued by DGEG. \n\n \n\nReading carefully the DSO\u2019s particular conditions, it is defined another financial warranty of \u20ac \n\n50,000 that RES Cooperative must provide in order to fulfil the process. Once again, \n\nconsidering a loan of \u20ac 50,000 from a bank with an interest rate of 5%, the annual cost for \n\nCoop\u00e9rnico would be \u20ac 2,500. \n\n \n\nWith all these documents (Figure 133), the RES Cooperative is in conditions to proceed to an \n\nagreement with EDP Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o in order to have access to RND. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n21 This contract shall apply the rules contained in the legislation, regulations and other documents in \n\nforce, namely: Regulation of network acess, trading regulation, tariff regulation, quality of service \n\nregulation, RNT and RND regulations, network operation regulations, the contract of adhesion for access \n\nthe system services market, the manual of procedures of the GGS, guide for reading, metering and \n\navailability of data, and a protocol for exploration (when applicable)  \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n180 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 133.

The different options available for the RES Cooperative to become an electricity supplier  \n\n \n\nIn relation to case 4, the RES Cooperative is just an intermediary of a company that already \n\noperates in the market. Through conditions well-defined in the contract, the RES Cooperative \n\nretails electricity in the name of others. However, within this last case there are two available \n\noptions: The billing be, or not to be, made by the Cooperative itself. \n\nFinancial warranty of \u20ac50,000 \n\nContractual agreement with the DSO Operator\nGeneral conditions, approved \n\nby ERSE\nParticular conditions, defined \n\nby the DSO\n\nHave the registration as a Market Agent, within the \nGGS\n\nThe registration of electricity supplier issued by DGEG\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n181 \n\n \n\nAs the intention is that the Cooperative logo appears in the electricity bill of the customer, as \n\nwell as in the ERSE\u2019s simulator, the only logical option is the billing be made by the RES \n\nCooperative. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 135. Advantages and Disadvantages of each Case (*considering loan banks are granted) \n\n \n\nIn relation to case 1,2 and 3 it was considered an annual operating cost for Coop\u00e9rnico of \u20ac \n\n46,000 plus the \u20ac 41,000 every month to purchase in advance the required energy demand for \n\nthe next market session. The cost of \u20ac 46,000 is divided in the annual cost with the ERP \n\nsoftware platform (~ \u20ac 10,000/year) and the annual cost with staff (~ \u20ac 36,000/year, considering \n\ntwo person fully dedicated to the activity). \n\nAlthough at this moment there is the idea of all the necessary requirements to be a supplier of \n\nelectricity in Portugal, in Coop\u00e9rnico are the members who choose the path to be followed by \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n182 \n\n \n\nthe Cooperative, regardless of the subject or activity. This time will be no different, which \n\nmeans the electricity retailing supply process will be also subject of consideration in short term.  \n\nThus, based on the advantages and disadvantages of each of the four possible cases (Figure \n\n135), members must choose the path that they consider to be the best for the Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s \n\nelectricity retailing supply process in accordance with their values, beliefs and what they think \n\nis the best for the future of the Cooperative. \n\n \n\n6. Conclusions \n\nThe IEM is an European purpose since the early nineties, however today it is still far from being \n\nachieved. The end of 2014 is just around the corner, and it\u2019s more than a certainty that the latest \n\npublished deadline for the completion of the IEM will not be met, once again. \n\nBesides the obvious differences in the EU member\u2019s approaches to the implementation of the \n\nEuropean directives or the failure to prevent the established monopolies with regard to market \n\nentry, market exit and pricing, there are also other reasons for failure to create a unified, \n\ncompetitive European energy market, such as: \n\n \n\n? Deliberate government interference motivated by a desire to support the main players in \neach electricity market; \n\n? Lack of interest by dominant players or governments to build additional transmission \nlines to facilitate cross-border energy trade; \n\n? Weak enforcement of EU directives at country level. \n\n \n\nThis means that somehow, the same economic and political reasons that led to deregulation and \n\nliberalisation of the European energy market are now preventing the IEM of being fully \n\nachieved. However, the path is already in its ending, and slowly the EU\u2019s vision is now \n\nbecoming a clear image. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, this long and evolutionary process of market liberalisation has also brought \n\nin the last decades new environmental, social and economic trends that are pushing Europe to \n\nurgently rethink the current energy system. Thus, supported by the raising awareness on climate \n\nchanges and the introduction of RES policies, market volatility, the increasing energy prices as \n\nwell as security of energy supply, \u201csocial enterprises\u201d are emerging as new independent energy \n\nplayers, in a number of European countries.  \n\nBelieving in the transformation of the energy system of the past towards a decentralised energy \n\nmodel, the RES Cooperatives are democratising the energy sector in almost every areas. For \n\ninstance, whilst the EU is just focused in the adoption and promotion of RES generation, in \n\nrelation to the supply activity there are no incentives to the green energy supply yet. As always, \n\nthe RES Cooperatives are already a step forward, and despite the non-existent incentives to fully \n\nsupply customers with green energy, currently the RES Cooperatives, based just on their \n\nconvictions and mission, are already a green option in their national electricity retail market \n\nsupplying those who wish to, with green electricity. \n\n \n\nBesides the four case studies (The Co-operative Energy in the UK, EWS in Germany, Som \n\nEnergia in Spain and Ecopower in Belgium), there are much more examples across Europe: \n\nEnercoop in France, GoiEner, Nosa Enerx\u00eda, EnerPlus and Zencer all from Spain, Greenpeace \n\nEnergy in Germany or NLD Energie and DE Unie from Netherlands. \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n183 \n\n \n\nAccording with their feedback, the reasons why RES Cooperatives are becoming a solid \n\nalternative solution to the traditional energy companies are: \n\n \n\n? Electricity at reasonable prices and good service provided; \n? Low level of trust in the big energy suppliers; \n? Consumers can reduce their environmental impact (by relying on RES); \n? Contribution for a new energetic paradigm; \n? Bringing energy production and consumption to the local level;  \n? Promoting local and economy development; \n\n \n\nMoreover, this work came with the conclusion that the two main causes behind the entry of the \n\nRES Cooperatives in the electricity retail market are the market opportunity and the non-\n\nexistence of an option more environmentally friendly that could contribute for a new sustainable \n\nenergy model supported by the RES Cooperatives.  \n\nBased on the experience shared by the RES Cooperatives, the work identified the main barriers \n\nthat a RES Cooperative may face during its electricity retailing supply process, such as: \n\n \n\n? Legislative complexity; \n? Financial issues; \n? The difficulty to clarify details related to the legislation and the energy market; \n? Buying electricity in the organised energy market. \n\n \n\nNevertheless, to overcome these possible obstacles it was suggested that in addition to qualities \n\nsuch as patience and perseverance, for instance the RES Cooperative shall have a clear \n\nmarketing strategy, besides create partnerships with other entities, whether Cooperatives or \n\npublic institutions, and seek the assistance of experts in the area. \n\nFinally, this study also came to the conclusion that an electricity retailing supply process is \n\nusually quite complex, which means that the RES Cooperative will not take less than half a year \n\nto complete.  However, from the moment the RES Cooperative has its offer in the national \n\nelectricity market the consumer\u2019s receptivity will be very positive, which will simultaneously \n\nboost the number of members of the Cooperative. \n\nThe costs involved in the process can vary according to the method chosen by the RES \n\nCooperative to operate in the organised energy market. Nevertheless, the experience tells that a \n\nvalue below \u20ac 50,000 will be enough for the RES Cooperative to start the activity of electricity \n\nretailing in Portugal. \n\n \n\nConsidering the complexity of each European electricity system with all its particular features, \n\nincluding the difference between national legislations, as well as the cultural differences \n\nbetween nations, this work tried to assess the role and experiences that each one of the RES \n\nCooperatives has faced in their own electricity supply market. Identified the positive and \n\nnegative pratices that may influence the RES Cooperative\u2019s process, at the moment it is possible \n\nto conclude Coop\u00e9rnico has all it takes to become the first green electricity supplier in Portugal. \n\nMoreover, all the steps and requirements demanded by the Portuguese and Iberian legislation \n\nwere compiled, including: \n\n \n\n? The registration of electricity supplier issued by DGEG; \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n184 \n\n \n\n? The license agreement with the DSO operator, which integrates general conditions \napproved by ERSE, as well as particular conditions defined by the DSO; \n\n? The status of Market Agent within the GGS; \n?  The available options to operate on the market managed by OMIE, buying and selling \n\nelectricity. \n\n \n\nBased on such information, it was listed four possible cases, including the advantages and \n\ndisadvantages of each one. Nevertheless, all in the end will transform the Coop\u00e9rnico as the first \n\ngreen electricity supplier in Portugal. \n\nAs in any other Cooperative, in Coop\u00e9rnico the internal democratic control is based on the \n\nprinciple of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d. However, more important than the present, is the future and \n\nthe strategy for the year ahead will be decided in the Coop\u00e9rnico\u2019s General Assembly in the \n\nmid-December 2014.  \n\nThus, independently of the voted path to be taken for the missing process, one thing is certain: \n\nfrom next year, the name of Coop\u00e9rnico will appear in the electricity bill of many consumers in \n\nPortugal. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n185 \n\n \n\n7. Annex \n\nResponses to inquiry: \n\n \n\nQuestion 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n? The Co-operative Energy: We entered the domestic energy supply market in \nDecember 2010. At the time, the United Kingdom had six major energy companies \n\n(British Gas, EDF, Eon, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE) who supplied over 98% of \n\ndomestic customers. However consumer confidence in these companies was incredibly \n\nlow, roughly in line with the banking industry. Customers were disengaged, didn\u2019t \n\nunderstand an incredibly complicated market with thousands of different tariffs which \n\nwere almost impossible to compare and had received consistent annual bill increases \n\nsignificantly higher than inflation. We entered the market with the intention of creating \n\na genuine Co-operative alternative to these six companies, acting in an open and honest \n\nmanner, inviting customers to join as members and have a say in how things are run, \n\nand heavily promoting the growth of sustainable, green electricity. \n\n? Enercoop: The core philosophy of Enercoop is to decentralize the energy market. In \nFrance the nuclear programme, that was established in the 1970\u2019s in response to the oil \n\ncrisis, has strongly biased centralized production, neglecting the opportunities of \n\ndecentralized and RES production. Enercoop wants to change this system. The \n\nliberalization of the energy market in 2004 enabled new actors to enter and change this \n\nmarket. The idea behind the development of regional cooperatives was to bring the \n\nproduction and supply of energy back on the local scale and therefore create an \n\nEnercoop in every region in France, or at a more local scale. The cooperative model \n\nallows citizens to get involved in the governance and ownership of supply and \n\nproduction. This is important according to Julien No\u00e9, Deputy Director of Enercoop: \n\n\u201cEnercoop believes that the consumer should be closer to the production. This will \n\nenable consumers to get a better understanding of what kind of product he is consuming \n\nand how this is produced. People will use it more rationally when they are involved on a \n\nlocal scale. They also better understand the goal behind developing energy production \n\nwhen they get involved in the decision-making process.\u201d Enercoop primarily operates \n\nas a supplier, meaning it buys energy from RES producers and sell it to its customers. \n\nThe producers can be member of the cooperative. The production itself is not \n\nnecessarily cooperatively owned, although Enercoop is increasingly investing in the \n\nfield. \n\n? EWS: The decision of EWS to start supplying electricity was a natural consequence of \nthe protest against nuclear power, and subsequent events. As the renounce of the use of \n\nnuclear energy itself was not enough to build up a new energetic paradigm, right after \n\nthere were some questions that came out. The most important was: Is it possible to save \n\nenergy in a relevant dimension without changing lifestyle?  \n\nThe first step was an energy saving competition across the village of Sch\u00f6nau. As it was \n\nnot enough to satisfy the people's needs, the next step was to proof that a green \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n186 \n\n \n\nelectricity supply in the village was possible, including a new tariff structure. As the \n\nlocal electricity supplier at the time did not share people's intentions, the citizens \n\ndecided to buy the electricity grid. \n\n? Greenpeace Energy: The liberalisation of energy markets towards in the late 1990s \nopened up the possibility to supply customers with green electricity. The environmental \n\nprotection organisation Greenpeace e.V. used the opportunity to develop criteria for \n\nhigh quality green electricity and, through the campaign \u201celectricity switch\u201d, gathered \n\nsupporters who demanded clean electricity. A public tender showed, however, that no \n\nsupplier was able meet all criteria. Greenpeace e.V. in response took matters into their \n\nown hands and initiated in autumn 1999 the foundation of the cooperative Greenpeace \n\nEnergy, an entity that is legally and financially independent of the environmental \n\nprotection organisation. Greenpeace Energy started supplying customers with clean \n\nelectricity according to the Greenpeace criteria on January 1st, 2000, and in 2001 \n\nfounded the subsidiary Planet energy, which constructs green power plants. \n\n? NLD Energie: There are a couple of reasons, but being most important is introducing a \ntruly local company for promoting local sustainability in a way that helps participating \n\nlocal initiatives attaining their sustainable goals. \n\n? DE Unie: DE Unie (THE Union) was established to operate independently of the \nexisting large energy companies. Local parties have different needs than the existing \n\nlarge companies. \n\n? Ecopower: The decision of Ecopower to start supplying electricity was initiated by its \nmembers at the general assembly in 2003 after the electricity market for private \n\nhouseholds in Flanders was liberalised. Ecopower then applied for a license to supply \n\n100% green electricity to its members. In 2003 Ecopower only had 2.975 shareholders. \n\nFrom then on the number of shareholders started growing rapidly. By 2008 we had \n\n16.815 members, by 2013 47.419 members. \n\n? Som Energia: The Cooperative identified an opportunity in the Spanish electricity \nmarket: the promoting of an democratic and clean energy model, based on RES, at the \n\nservice of the people and that protects the environment. As a consequence, Som Energia \n\nstarted to give customers the chance to buy green electricity at a price equivalent to \n\nconventional electricity.  \n\n? GoiEner: Our first intention was producing and after start into the electricity retail \nmarket. Spanish laws changed in 2012, just the year we started to think about how to \n\nstart the cooperative. Producing was impossible so we went into the electricity retail \n\nmarket. No option. \n\n? Zencer: To provide consumers with real access to the liberalized electricity market, \nthrough a democratic formulated and environmentally sustainable. \n\n? EnerPlus: The fight against corruption and backdoor deals. \n? Nosa Enerx\u00eda: The governance their own power company , achieve 100% electricity , \n\nlow level in trust in the big energy companies, seek a sustainable development, social \n\nempowerment,\u2026 \n\n \n\nQuestion 3. \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n187 \n\n \n\n \n\n?

The Co-operative Energy: There is a huge amount of red tape and legislative and \nregulatory complexity that needs to be adhered to prior to being provided a supply \n\nlicense and completing Ofgems (the UKs regulator) controlled market entry process. \n\nWe overcame this by recruiting an experience Regulation Manager who, along with our \n\nGroup General Manager, oversaw the entire process to ensure we were fully compliant. \n\nMoreover, the company had the support of a larger Cooperative, The Midcounties Co-\n\noperative. \n\n?

The Co-operative Energy: We have found that in the UK the public have welcomed \nthe introduction of Co-operative Energy and we have had a huge amount of interest and \n\nwell-wishers. When entering a new industry it is important to get the right mix of senior \n\nmanagement in the business, containing both experienced professionals from the energy \n\nindustry and also from a co-operative background to ensure that the business is run \n\ndifferently to the other players in the industry. Stay true to the co-operative ethics and \n\nvalues and there will be a captive audience waiting to join. \n\n? Enercoop: Make sure there is no other existing offer (market study). Have a strong \nteam of people carrying the project. Cooperate with other cooperatives (national and \n\nEuropean level) to get their input on the process and have a full project behind the idea \n\nof being an electricity supplier, not just a business model if you want people to join the \n\nprocess. \n\n? EWS: Don\u2019t talk and think too much, just start and convince your neighbours and \nfriends to join the movement. Produce clean energy and don\u2019t give your money to \n\nnuclear industry.  Cooperate with the municipality, have fun while working, believe in \n\nsolidarity and create new ideas. \n\n? Greenpeace Energy: Do not only sell green energy, try to become a producer as well. \nBuild new green power plants. Be an real alternative to the big energy companies and \n\ninvolve your cooperative members in the project. \n\n? NLD Energie: Think it through. We experience it to be a difficult market. You need to \nhave a good marketing strategy, because only gaining early adopters is not enough. You \n\nneed to gain scale to be viable as a company. \n\n? DE Unie: perseverance. \n? Ecopower: Big advantage to have a single cost per kWh because it makes people more \n\naware of their energy consumption. People consider the consumption of their own \n\nsustainable energy more important than a financial return. Finally, there's a good chance \n\nthat the number of shareholders will increase if you start supplying energy. \n\n? Som Energia: Just start, give same price and great service. \n? GoiEner: If you are going to be a Cooperative for all Portugal, and there are local \n\nsmallest cooperatives, help them to develop. Don\u00b4t use a centralized model for retail \n\nelectricity. Share the know-how with other cooperatives in Portugal and share the tools \n\nfor that. We are sharing now the costs of the software platform we are developing with \n\nthe other small cooperatives in Spain.  \n\n? Zencer: Each market is different and the way of being and thinking of the people who \ncompose it, so it's tricky to give you some advice about it. First I would advise to get in \n\ncontact with other social economy companies or associations who share with you the \n\ngoals set in your Cooperative (the union makes the strength), this being your natural \n\nmarket growth. Social networks play in this sense a great role, which should be \n\nexploited. Start slowly and retraining, initiating economic activity on a solid financial \n\nbase and management, enabling partners to obtain from the outset the objectives \n\npromise. Finally, from our cooperative we offer you our support and advice from our \n\nexperience in the electricity market and the beginning of a journey of collaboration \n\nbetween both cooperatives, such as your representation as agents in the market, if it is \n\nof your interest or collaboration on the joint development of projects of renewable \n\nenergy generation. \n\n? EnerPlus: Just do it. \n? Nosa Enerx\u00eda: The cooperative needs to do an action and business plan and try to get a \n\nminimum of members to hold the project. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process \n\n \n\n Nelson Andr\u00e9 Galv\u00e3o Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              \n\n197 \n\n \n\n8.
