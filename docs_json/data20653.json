Weekly data was used from March 2013 to March 2015 with a \n\ntotal of 105 observations.  The prices were collected from the Quandl futures database \n\nand are settlement prices from the front outrights. The Back-Adjusted method was \n\nchosen to perform the roll over. \n\nWe started by studying the correlation between US Dollar Index and Brent Crude Oil \n\nprices. Confirming the conclusions of other studies, we found a negative correlation \n\nbetween the prices of Brent Crude Oil and the US Dollar Index. The Granger Causality \n\ntest gave us enough statistical evidence to conclude that a variation in Brent Crude Oil \n\nprices indeed cause an impact on the US Dollar Index. \n\nBy applying Johansen`s cointegration test we indeed found cointegrating vectors \n\nbetween Brent Crude Oil, the US Dollar Index and each one of the studied agricultural \n\ncommodities. The next step was to build vector error correction models. Although some \n\nof them proved not to be rock solid, we manage to establish a link among the variables, \n\nnamely in the case of Soybean, which produce remarkable results and may, in fact, be \n\ntreated as a benchmark for traders of future contracts. \n\nKeywords: Cointegration, Future Contracts, agricultural commodities, Brent Crude Oil, \n\nUS Dollar Index \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n \n\nFirst, I would like to thank my supervisor Pierre Hoonhout for all the support and \n\nadvices given along the process which undoubtedly contributed for the final outcome o f \n\nthis dissertation. \n\nTo my family, especially to my parents and to my brother, for the unconditional support \n\nthey always gave me. \n\nA special thanks goes also to my colleagues at OSTC for the daily support, knowledge \n\nsharing and motivation to pursue this topic. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\nTable of Contents \n\n \n\n1  Introduction 1 \n\n2  Literature Review 3 \n\n3  The Data 7 \n\n4  Methodology 9 \n\n 4.1 Stationary and non-stationary time series 9 \n\n 4.2 Augmented Dickey-Fuller test 10 \n\n 4.3 Cointegration 11 \n\n 4.4 Johansen test 12 \n\n 4.5 Granger Causality test 13 \n\n 4.6 Akaike Information Criteria 14 \n\n 4.7 VAR model, VEC model 14 \n\n5  Empirical Results 17 \n\n 5.1 Relationship between Brent Crude Oil Prices and the US Dollar \n\nIndex \n\n21 \n\n 5.2 Relationship between Brent Crude Oil price, the US Dollar Index \n\nand some agricultural commodities price \n\n25 \n\n6  Summary and Conclusions 32 \n\n7  References 34 \n\n8  Appendix 36 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\nList of Tables \n\n \n\nTable I -  Critical Values of ADF test 18 \n\nTable II -  Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (results in level) 18 \n\nTable III -  Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (results in first differences) 19 \n\nTable IV - Johansen Cointegration Test output 21 \n\nTable V - Granger Causality Test output 22 \n\nTable VI - Vector Error Correction Model 23 \n\nTable VII - Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation LM Test and ARCH Test 24 \n\nTable VIII - Johansen\u00b4s trace test results 26 \n\nTable IX -  Cointegrating vectors 27 \n\nTable X -  Short Run Parameter Estimates 28 \n\nTable XI - Tests and Residual Diagnostics 29 \n\nTable XII - Optimal Lag Length Selection 37 \n\nTable XIII - Choosing appropriate model for VECM on Brent Crude Oil price \n\nand US Dollar \n\n38 \n\nTable XIV - Statistics from VECM (Brent Crude Oil \u2013 US Dollar Index) 39 \n\nTable XV - Johansen Test Results - Corn, Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar Index 40 \n\nTable XVI - Johansen Test Results - Sugar, Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar Index 40 \n\nTable XVII - Johansen Test Results - Coffee, Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar \n\nIndex \n\n41 \n\nTable XVIII - Johansen Test Results - Cocoa, Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar \n\nIndex \n\n41 \n\nTable XIX Johansen Test Results - Cotton, Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar \n\nIndex \n\n42 \n\nTable XX -  Johansen Test Results - Soybean, Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar \n\nIndex \n\n42 \n\nTable XXI - Johansen Test Results - Wheat, Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar \n\nIndex \n\n43 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\nList of Figures \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Stationary and non-stationary time series 9 \n\nFigure 2 - Example of cointegrated time series, Ba\u00e7\u00e3o (2000) 12 \n\nFigure 3 - Plot of Brent Crude Oil and US Dollar Index 17 \n\nFigure 4 -  Graph of ?

Speculation played a key role \n\nin the development of financial markets and trading platforms.  \n\nFrom stocks to bonds, futures and options nowadays it is possible to trade hundreds of \n\nthousands of different financial products. With the flourishing of organized clearing \n\nhouses and the generalization of electronic trading the financial markets have now more \n\nliquidity than ever and are at every person\u00b4s reach. \n\nHaving this context as starting point, this dissertation aims to test the presence of \n\ncointegrating relations between the prices of future contracts in Brent Crude Oil, US \n\nDollar Index and agricultural commodities.  \n\nExchange rates are known for their direct impact on the export and import of goods and \n\nservices and, thus, are expected to influence the price of these trading commodities.  \n\nAt the same time, the use of chemical and petroleum derived inputs has increased in \n\nagriculture over time. It is therefore expected that energy, namely the price of Crude \n\nOil, to have an important impact in commodity production. \n\nWorking as a futures trader for OSTC Portugal, I find this topic deeply interesting and \n\nuseful both in theoretical and practical framework.  \n\nThe number of future contracts traded on exchanges worldwide is increasing every year \n\nand dozens of millions of contracts change hands every trading day. \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n2 \n \n\nAccording to FIA (Futures Industry Association), more than 12,1 billion future \n\ncontracts were traded worldwide in 2014 alone. Agricultural commodities have also \n\nbeing flourishing in 2014, showing a volume increase of more than 15% from \n\napproximately 1,2 billion contracts traded in 2013 to 1,4 billion in 2014. \n\nMany prior studies were conducted to test these relations between Crude Oil prices and \n\nagricultural commodities prices (Nazlioglu (2012)), between the US Dollar strength and \n\nagricultural commodities prices (Abbot et al. (2008)) and between the three variables \n\n(Harri et al (2009)) over a significantly long period of time using weekly or monthly \n\ndata. \n\nTrading future contracts is a highly leveraged investment. The initial margin required to \n\nenter into a new futures contract is usually lower than 10% of the futures contract. \n\nThis may bring a big profit (or loss) to an investor for a small market movement. In fact, \n\nmany futures traders enter in a position to make 1 or 2 ticks (minimum amount prices of \n\nfuture contracts can move).   \n\nTherefore, this study will focus on a short-run analysis with weekly observations, which \n\nmay lead to novel conclusions and serve as a benchmark for practical purposes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n3 \n \n\n2. Literature Review \n\nIs there any relationship between exchange rates and Crude Oil prices and commodities \n\nprices? This subject has been studied by different authors in the last years. The purpose \n\nof their studies is mainly related to a practical need: to find a comprehensive model that \n\nexplains past prices and predicts future prices of those commodities.  \n\nIn fact, the fluctuation of Crude Oil prices ( by far the most traded commodity) and the \n\nvolatility of some agricultural commodities (corn, wheat, soybean, for example) and \n\nalso the exchange rate (mainly the US Dollar exchange rate, in comparison with other \n\ncurrencies, euro, yen, Australian dollar)  tend to be correlated. How do they influence \n\neach other?   \n\nNovotni (2012) studied the relationship between the nominal effective exchange rate of \n\nthe US Dollar and the Brent Crude Oil price, examining monthly data from January \n\n1982 to September 2010. He modeled the Brent Crude Oil price as a function of some \n\nexplanatory variables: nominal effective exchange rate of US Dollar, the industrial \n\nproduction of the OCDE countries and oil inventories of United States. He concluded \n\nthat, in the period between 2005 and 2010, Brent Crude Oil price and the exchange rate \n\nwere related in an inverse way: decreasing the nominal effective exchange rate of the \n\nDollar of 1% implies an increase in the Brent Crude Oil price of 2,1%. Before 2005 the \n\ncorrelation between those two variables was very weak or even inexistent. \n\nOne explanation for the inverse relation between Brent Crude Oil price and the effective \n\nexchange rate of the US Dollar may be the fact that commodities are traded in US \n\nDollar, so depreciation in US Dollar implies the compensatory rise of the commodities \n\nprice.   \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n4 \n \n\nNatalenov et al (2013) studied the relationship between Crude Oil, corn and ethanol \n\nduring a particularly turbulent period between 2006 and the end of 2011. \n\nTheir first conclusion was that, considering the whole period of time, there was no \n\ncorrelation between these three variables. Then the period of time was divided in two \n\nsub periods, the first from March 2005 to July 2008, and the second period of time from \n\nAugust 2008 to the end of 2011. At the same time, they decided to look for a bi-variate \n\nrelation between two variables, instead of looking for cointegrated relations between the \n\nprices of the three mentioned commodities. \n\nThey came to the conclusion that, between 2008 and 2011, the Brent Crude Oil price \n\nand corn, and the Brent Crude Oil price and ethanol, were linearly related, with changes \n\nof the Brent Crude Oil price implying changes, with the same signal but with different \n\namplitude, on the corn and the ethanol prices. \n\nNatalenov referred to some factors that may have contributed to the complex relation \n\nbetween those three commodities prices: The Energy Policy Act of 2005, Crude Oil \n\nprice level surpassing the threshold of 75 USD/barrel and the 2008 financial crises.  \n\nNazlioglu (2012) analysed the price transmission from the world oil prices to the key \n\nagricultural commodity prices by employing weekly data from 1994 to 2010. Using \n\nGranger causality test, Nazlioglu found empirical evidence of a nonlinear causal linkage \n\nbetween Oil and the agricultural commodity prices for corn, soybean and wheat. \n\nAnother study on this topic was put forth by Campiche et al. (2007). This research \n\nexamined the co-variability between Crude Oil prices and corn, sugar, sorghum, \n\nsoybeans, soybeans oil and palm oil prices during the period 2003-2007. Johansen \n\ncointegration tests revealed no cointegrating relationships during 2003-2005, but a \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n5 \n \n\npositive cointegration of corn prices and soybean prices with oil prices during the 2006-\n\n2007 time periods. \n\nAbbot et al. (2008) highlights the strong and important link between the US Dollar \n\nIndex and commodity prices.  Most commodities are priced in US Dollars, but are \n\npurchased in the local currency. When the dollar strength falls there is a link with rising \n\ncommodity prices. \n\nA similar approach is used by Murphy (1999). By graphically illustrating a similar path \n\nbetween gold prices and the US Dollar Index from April 1995 to October 1996, it states \n\nthat a rising Dollar normally has a depressing effect on most commodity prices. \n\nHarri et al (2009) studied the relationship between the exchange rate (measured as a \n\ntrade weight average of the US dollar value against other major currencies), Crude Oil \n\nprice and some other commodities (mainly corn, cotton and soybeans) prices. By using \n\noverlapping time periods taken from monthly data, between January 2000 and \n\nSeptember 2008, they found a cointegration relationship: oil prices are linked to corn, \n\ncotton and soybeans, but not to wheat. \n\nThey also found that the exchange rates, crude oil and corn prices are correlated, and \n\nthat exchange rates influence the linkage of the commodities prices over time. \n\nRosa et al (2012) have studied the relationship between some agricultural commodities \n\nand crude oil prices, trying to test the hypothesis that the increased volatility in \n\nagricultural prices is caused by the exogenous crude oil prices. They used data between \n\nJanuary 1999 and May 2012, and this study compared the prices of corn, wheat and \n\nsoybean (whose choice is justified because they are the most traded agricultural \n\ncommodities used on feedstock, food and fuel) with the crude oil price.  \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n6 \n \n\nThe authors concluded for a strong non-linear linkage between crude oil and corn \n\nprices, explained by the increased use of corn in the production of ethanol. The \n\nvolatility of the crude oil price causes some volatility on corn and soybean prices, too, \n\nbecause of their energy and industrial use. The case of wheat prices is different: an \n\nincrease in consumption leads to the decrease in wheat stocks, which is responsible for \n\nthe large increase in wheat prices, during that period of time. \n\nZhang (2013) used Granger causality test to test the hypothesis that changes on the price \n\nof crude oil causes the change in the US dollar exchange rate, and not vice-versa. Golub \n\n(2013) explains that effect saying that when the oil price rises, it increases the income of \n\noil exporting countries and those countries use the higher income to purchase more US \n\ndollars, which causes its appreciation. Using monthly data between January 2003 and \n\nJune 2010, Zhang finds no evidence of significant cointegration between the two \n\nmentioned variables, but that evidence appears when allowing for two structural breaks \n\nin the past: November 1986 and February 2005 (these two dates are related with \n\nimportant changes in the oil market). He finally concludes that there is a stable \n\nrelationship between the price of Crude Oil and the value of the US dollar exchange \n\nrate, but that relationship has been subject to structural breaks over time. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n7 \n \n\n3. The Data \n\nThe data used in this study is the Quandl Future prices database and comprises of \n\nweekly data (Tuesday) from the first trading Tuesday of March 2013 until the first \n\ntrading Tuesday of March 2015 with a total of 105 observations per product. \n\nThe variables used are futures in Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar Index, Corn, Soybean, \n\nWheat, Cocoa, Coffee C, Cotton and Sugar No.11.  \n\nThe US Dollar Index is a measure of the value of the US Dollar relative to a basket of \n\nforeign currencies. It is calculated as a weighted geometric mean of Dollar\u00b4s value \n\nagainst Euro, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and \n\nSwiss Franc. In the future markets, one contract is traded as 1000$ x Index Value. \n\nAll the prices collected are settlement prices, which is a trade weighted average of the \n\nnumber of lots traded at each price over a certain period of time, shortly before the close \n\nof the market. This price is used to determine the profit or loss for the day in order to \n\nupdate margin requirements. \n\nAll these future prices are from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a leading network \n\nof exchanges and clearing houses for financial and commodity markets, which operates \n\ncompletely as an electronic exchange. \n\nOne important aspect that we face when dealing with future contracts is the expiring \n\nnature of the product.  \n\nFutures are not continuous contracts such as stocks. Each specific contract has a starting \n\ntrading day and an expiring day.  For this reason, it is essential to use a roll method \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n8 \n \n\nbetween contracts to create a continuous future contract which can later be used for \n\nback testing. \n\nStringing subsequent price series together creates a discontinuous time series since the \n\nexpiring of a contract and the passage to the next front-month may carry significant \n\nprice gaps. \n\nTherefore, the roll method used in this study is the Back-Adjusted method. The gap \n\nbetween two contracts is measured, and then added or subtracted to all values in the \n\nprior contracts. \n\nThis method is one of the most commonly used for this purpose, being also used by \n\nCQG Trader, a leading high-performance market data and electronic trading application \n\nused by future traders worldwide. \n\nThis work has been made of attempts and reformulations depending on the results and \n\ndifficulties, which were found throughout the process. However, it was carried out the \n\nusual approach in this type of work: the sources and the data to be used were selected; \n\nthe next step was to verify whether the data presented some kind of correlation (a look \n\non the plot of the data is useful to this purpose) and run some tests concerning that \n\ncorrelation. The third step was to find a model that could express the evolution in time \n\nof the variables which were to be studied in order to fit the purpose of this analysis: try \n\nto understand in what sense agricultural commodities prices are related with the \n\nexchange rate and the Brent Crude Oil price. \n\nThe statistical software used to conduct this research was EViews. We\u00b4ve choose \n\nEViews because it is commonly used in statistical works and provides all kind of tests, \n\nmodels and tools that should be necessary. \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n9 \n \n\n4. Methodology \n\nThis section discusses theoretical principles used in this work. \n\n4.1. Stationary and non-stationary time series \n\nGujarati (2011) refers that \u201ca time series is said to be stationary if its mean and variance are \n\nconstant over time and the value of the covariance between the two periods depends only on \n\nthe distance or gap or lag between the two time periods and not the actual time at which the \n\ncovariance is computed\u201d . However, many time series, more exactly typically financial time \n\nseries, often display some kind of systematic upward or downward movement through time \n\nand, as a consequence, are not stationary.  \n\nStationary and non-stationary time series demand different approaches, otherwise forecast \n\nstudies will predict, most probably, inconsistent conclusions and unrealistic or divergent \n\nresults. A time series with a trend is one of the most usual examples of non-stationary time \n\nseries. \n\nFigure 1 illustrates a stationary and a non-stationary time series.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 1: stationary time series and non-stationary time series, respectively  \n\n(Asteriou, 2007) \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n10 \n \n\nIf the series has a deterministic long-run trend it may be possible to transform it into \n\nstationarity, by considering the deviations from the trend. If the trend is stochastic, \n\ntransformation into stationarity requires first-differencing. \n\nOnly rarely is differencing more than once necessary to obtain stationary time series. \n\n \n\n4.2. Augmented Dickey-Fuller  (ADF) test  \n\nTo test the stationarity of a time series we usually use the reference test or the Augmented \n\nDickey-Fuller test.  \n\nDickey and Fuller proposed three alternative regression equations, based on a simple AR(1) \n\nmodel, that can be used for testing for the presence of unit root as synonymous of non-\n\nstationarity.  \n\nThese equations are:                                ttt uyy ??? ?1?                      (1) \n\n                                                                 ttt uyy ???? ?1??                (2) \n\n                                                                 ttt uyty ????? ?1???          (3)  \n\nWhere (3) includes a time trend and a constant and (2) only includes a constant. \n\nDF test is a t-test, but not a conventional one, so we must use non standard critical values \n\nwhich were first calculated by Dickey and Fuller, and later by other authors. \n\nDickey and Fuller extended their test procedure including extra lagged terms of the \n\ndependent variable. This allows for the testing of unit roots in autoregressive processes that \n\nare of order higher than one, \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n11 \n \n\nThe three possible equations of the test are the same but now they all include the additional \n\nterm ? ? ??\np\n\ni iti\ny\n\n1\n.? . So we have the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, with the null hypotheses \n\ndefined as Ho: there is a unit root. \n\nThis test may be used with all the variables and, when non-stationarity is observed, it may \n\nbe used again to test their first differences, second differences, and so on. \n\nWe say that a variable is integrated of order 1, or simply )1(I  when the series is non-\n\nstationary in level but his first differences are stationary. \n\n \n\n4.3. Cointegration \n\nIf we have two or more non-stationary time series, that become stationary when differenced, \n\nsuch that some linear combination of those series is stationary, then we say that they are \n\ncointegrated. That means that those series show some kind of long-run relationship. \n\nIn other words, we say that two )1(I  time series tx  and ty  are cointegrated, if there is a ?  \n\nsuch that ttt xyz .???  is stationary. \n\nFigure 2 illustrates the situation: tx  and ty  are non-stationary, but in long-run they are \n\nmoving together. So we may find a relation between those two series, and define a third one \n\nwhich is stationary. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE 2: Example of cointegrated time series,  Ba\u00e7\u00e3o (2000) \n\nIn this example, if we suppose that \nt\n\nz  is approached by\ntt\n\nyx .2? , for instance, then )2,1( ?  \n\nwill be a cointegrating vector between the variables \nt\n\nx  and\nt\n\ny .

Johansen test \n\nTo test the existence of cointegration between the variables, we may use, at least, one of \n\nthree kind of tests: the Engle-Granger cointegration test developed by Engle and Granger \n\n(1987), the Philips-Ouliaris reference test, presented by these authors, or most recently the \n\nJohansen cointegration test, presented by Johansen and Juselius in 1990. \n\nThe main advantage of the Johansen test, regarding the others tests, consists in the \n\ndetermination of the number of cointegrating vectors that exists among the studied variables, \n\nwhen these variables are cointegrated, and provides estimates of all cointegrating vectors. \n\nAs Dwyer (2014) refers, the Johansen test can be seen as a multivariate generalization of the \n\nADF test because it is the study of linear combination of variables for unit roots. It must be \n\nnoticed that if there are n  variables, each with unit roots, there are 1?n  possible co-\n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n13 \n \n\nintegrating vectors, and if there are n variables and n  cointegrating vectors, then we may \n\nconclude that the variables do not have unit roots.  \n\nJohansen proposes two different tests: the trace test and the \nmax\n\n? test.  \n\nThe trace test is based on the log-likelihood ratio )](/)(ln[\nmaxmax\n\nkLrL  and is conducted \n\nsequentially for 0,1,...,1?? kr . This test tests the null hypothesis that the cointegration rank \n\nis equal to r against the alternative hypothesis that the cointegration rank is equal to k . \n\nAsteriou (2007) refers four steps in Johansen test approach: step 1: test the order of \n\nintegration of all variables; step 2: set the appropriate lag length of the model. This may be \n\ndone using some criteria that we will see next; step 3: choose the appropriate model that \n\ncorrelates the variables; step 4: determine the rank of ?   or the number of cointegrating \n\nvectors, using max? test or trace test. \n\n  \n\n4.5. Granger causality test. \n\nWe may test the possibility of statistical precedence between them: which one causes the \n\nother one movement? We may test it in both directions, using the Granger causality test.  \n\nGiven two sets of time series data, tx  and ty , we may create two models to test which of \n\nthem better fits to predict ty : one model only with past values of ty  and the other model \n\nwith past values of ty and tx .  \n\nThe residual sum of squares errors is compared and a test is used to determine which model \n\nis more adequate to explain the future values of ty .

Akaike Information Criterion \n\nWe must compare the goodness of fit data-models, to decide the number of lags must be \n\nused in the model. We may use some criteria provided by R or EViews software, for \n\ninstance: the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Finite Prediction Error (FPE), the \n\nSchwarz Baysean Criterion (SBC) and the Hannan and Quin Criterion (HQC).  \n\nIdeally the chosen model should be the one which minimizes all these criteria. However, \n\nsometimes the results are contradictory, and in the analysis of time series the statistic most \n\ncommonly used is AIC. It is defined by: \n\n                                                           n\nk\n\ne\nn\n\nRSS\nAIC\n\n2\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?

VAR (Vector Autoregressive) model, VEC (Vector Error Correction) model  \n\nWe may model a time series data using some models. The simplest one is the autoregressive \n\nof order one model AR(1), which is given by:         \n\n                                          ttt uyy ?? ?1.?

This model assumes that the actual value of \n\nt\ny  is determined by its own value in the precedent period. \n\nThe model becomes more complex when we have more than one time series, with the actual \n\nvalues of each one influenced not only by its own past values, but also by the past values of \n\nall the others variables. In this case we can use a VAR model. \n\nPfaff (2006) defines a Vector Autoregressive model as a set of k endogenous variables \n\nwritten in the form:  \n\nuptptt\nuyAyAy ????\n\n??\n...\n\n11\n.

EViews provide us with five distinct models depending \n\non the existence of intercept and trend in CE or in VAR; the model with trend in CE and in \n\nVAR is only theoretical (non realistic) so, in practice, it is rarely adopted. \n\nIn VECM model, the rank (or trace) of matrix \n'\n\n? has the following lecture, concerning with the \n\ncointegration of the variables: if 0?r  there is no cointegration (we can\u2019t use VECM, only \n\nVAR in first differences); if kr ??0  there are r cointegrating vectors (we can use VECM); if \n\nkr ?  all the variables are already stationary, so we may use VAR on level data. \n\n \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n17 \n \n\n5.

The \n\nresults of the Johansen\u2019s trace test for cointegration are reported in Table VIII and the \n\ncomplete results of trace tests are in Tables XV to XXI. \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n26 \n \n\nTABLE  VIII  \n\nJohansen\u2019s trace test  \n\n(Brent Crude Oil price, US Dollar Index and each agricultural commodity) \n\n \n\nModel 2 \n\n      5%* Coffee Cotton \n\nr=2 9,16 2,44 3,36 \n\nr=1 20,26 16,00 16,14 \n\nr=0  35,19 40,32 42,60 \n\n \n\nModel 4 \n\n 5% * Cocoa        Sugar        Soybean        Wheat       Corn \n\nr=2 12,52 6,96          5,36          9,55               7,30           5,38 \n\nr=1 25,87 20,70        17,64        21,71            15,56         13,54 \n\nr=0  42,92 46,74         53,44        64,80            46,98         46,10 \n\n*Critical Values \n\n \n\nIn all cases, the trace statistic indicates a cointegration rank of r = 1, given a 5% \n\nsignificance level.

Summary and conclusions \n\nWith the recent unusual volatility in the prices of some agricultural commodities and the \n\nBrent Crude Oil plumbing being often blamed for that, this dissertation aimed to test the \n\nstrength of this correlation and to what extent speculators can use it as a benchmark. \n\nThe dollar strength, being quantified as the US Dollar Index, was also used as an \n\nindependent variable highlighting the possible direct impact that Forex markets can \n\ncause to these variables which are all quoted in US Dollars on ICE (Intercontinental \n\nExchange, inc.).  \n\nFirst, we started by studying the correlation between the Brent Crude Oil prices and the \n\nUS Dollar Index. We found a cointegrating vector between these two variables (which \n\nrevealed the inverse relationship between them) and, applying the Granger Causality \n\ntest, we found that a change in Brent Crude Oil prices causes a change in US Dollar \n\nIndex.  \n\nA regard over the plot of both time series also highlights this relationship. The recent \n\nplunge of Brent Crude Oil prices due to Iran\u00b4s increasingly oil production after having \n\nits sanctions lifted, and the slowdown of China\u00b4s manufacturing were followed by an \n\nenormous spike in the US Dollar Index. \n\nThe next step was to study the cointegrating relations between Brent Crude Oil prices, \n\nthe US Dollar Index and each one of the selected agricultural commodities. \n\nThrough the application of the ADF and Johansen trace tests we concluded that all \n\nvariables are stationary of order one and there is one cointegrating vector between all \n\nthe three variables. \n\nNext, we built vector error correction models and conducted its analysis and the study \n\nof residuals. \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n33 \n \n\nLow statistical significance was found for all coefficients of Wheat and Cotton. A \n\nfeature which may indicate the low dependence of petroleum based inputs in these crops \n\nand a stable demand and supply of these commodities independently of Forex markets. \n\nFor Cocoa, Soybean, Sugar and Corn we have statistically significant coefficients of \n\nadjustment (alpha). The low value of alpha for Corn indicates a slow retrace of this \n\ncommodity to equilibrium after a shock. The ARCH test made for this variable also \n\nindicates that we can\u00b4t reject the hypothesis of heteroskedasticity in its residuals for a \n\n5% significance level.  \n\nThe Soybean model was the one with the most statistically significant coefficients. A \n\nfeature certainly related with the increasingly use of Soybean in the production of \n\nbiofuel. \n\nOn the other hand, one of the most unexpected conclusions of this dissertation was the \n\nlack of correlation between Corn prices and the prices of Brent Crude Oil. \n\nThe use of Corn for the production of ethanol, which can be used as a substitute for both \n\ncrude oil and gasoline, would expectedly create a link between these variables as \n\npointed out by Natalenov et al (2013). \n\nNevertheless, this type of research must be carefully interpreted, since correlations \n\nmight appear in different periods of time as was already proven by different studies. \n\nOne thing we can be sure: Brent Crude Oil and the strength of the US Dollar do play a \n\nrole in the price variation of agricultural commodities which should not be forgotten by \n\nboth, speculators and agricultural companies who wish to hedge their exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n34 \n \n\n7.
