Invasion ecology is a relatively recent field of \n\nincreasing importance in environmental research and management, with a growing number of \n\npublications and new wide-reaching initiatives. Even so, many questions still need to be answered \n\nand more research is clearly needed. This work investigated several aspects of the invasion of a \n\nMediterranean dune ecosystem by a Leguminosae tree, Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd., aiming to \n\ncontribute to filling some specific gaps in invasion Ecology, and providing practical and useful \n\nmanagement options for managers. \n\nThe effects of A. longifolia at vegetation level, in areas with different invasion durations (stands \n\ninvaded for more than 20 years, hereafter \u201clong-invaded\u201d, compared to stands invaded after a \n\nsummer fire in 1995 \u2013 hereafter \u201crecently invaded\u201d) were compared, over a five-year period, with \n\nnon-invaded situations, using multiple parameters. Results showed that the longer the invader is \n\npresent in the system, the more pronounced are the impacts (e.g. decrease of plant cover, initial \n\ndiversity and total species richness; fewer species shared with native areas; species traits altered) \n\nand the higher is the reinvasion potential due to germination of seeds of A. longifolia. Native dune \n\necosystems which were historically almost treeless were converted into highly modified systems, \n\ncomposed by almost mono-specific woodlands with a series of structural and functional changes \n\nwhich are dynamic and apparently tend to stabilize after several decades. The use of multiple \n\nparameters revealed that analyses including few, or only single figure parameters, concealed some \n\nof the changes taking place as invasions progress. \n\nSeed ecology of A. longifolia was studied, including quantification of the seed rain (trials with seed \n\ntraps), measurement of seed viability through time (burial experiments) and the extent of the soil \n\nseed bank (soil core extraction). Copious production of seeds was measured (ca. 12 000 seeds \n\nfalling per m-2 annually), which concentrated mostly under the A. longifolia canopies. Although many \n\nseeds were lost both before and after entering the soil seed bank, seeds remaining in the soil were \n\nstill numerous (ca. 1500 and 500 seeds m-2 in long- and recently invaded stands, respectively). \n\nScarce seeds were found up to 7 m from the edge of stands, indicating that outside agents facilitated \n\ndispersal, and new invasion foci may arise if the right stimuli occur. This source of propagules \n\nenables A. longifolia to rapidly reinvade areas after disturbance (e.g. deliberate removal of plants, or \n\nfire). The number of seeds in the soil declined through time, with only 30% surviving after 6 years, \n\nwith lower losses at greater depths. Germinability of buried seeds that survived was low (<12%) but \n\nviability was very high (>85%). \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n\nRecovery potential in long- and recently invaded stands was assessed using two distinct \n\napproaches: 1) soil seed banks were evaluated (seedling emergence method), comparing cleared \n\nplots (where both A. longifolia and its litter layer were removed) vs. uncleared plots; and 2) \n\nexperimentally cleared plots were monitored, from 2002 to 2008 (a period that was longer than most \n\nremoval studies), comparing A. longifolia removal with and without the underlying litter layer. Results \n\nof both experiments showed that the system is resilient, but less so in long-invaded areas, with many \n\nnative plant species backing up autogenic recovery to a certain level. Nevertheless, many \n\nreappearing species were generalists and six years after clearing, several species and some traits \n\ntypical from dunes were still missing (or scarce). Germination of A. longifolia seeds, as well as other \n\nexotics, impeded successful natural recovery, alerting that follow up interventions will be required. \n\nThe seedling emergence method apparently gave an exaggerated impression of the extent of the \n\ndegradation in actual field conditions, but was the only method that revealed A. longifolia seeds in \n\nnon-invaded areas and allowed a rapid assessment of the ecosystem resilience without major \n\nclearing efforts. Long-term field monitoring of cleared sites provided a more detailed insight into the \n\nrecovery potential of invaded areas, revealing more than twice the species found in the seedling \n\nemergence trials. However, the field trials were more expensive, time-consuming and took longer to \n\nfurnish results. The removal of the thick litter layer (particularly in long-invaded areas) in field plots \n\nwas cost-effective facilitating germination of more species and eliminating many A. longifolia seeds. \n\nAlthough distinct, both methods complemented each other.  \n\nThe biological control agent Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae (Australian gall forming wasp), that \n\ntargets seed reduction of A. longifolia, and additionally curtails its vegetative growth to some level, \n\nhas been successfully used in South Africa for more than 20 years. It was therefore screened as a \n\npossible candidate for use in Portugal. Specificity tests, including 40 non-target plant species, gave \n\npromising results, indicating that T. acaciaelongifoliae can be a safe (and cost-effective) alternative \n\nto other control methods currently available in Portugal. Oviposition in non-choice tests was detected \n\nin three non-target species but subsequent trials in potted plants and surveys in the field (in Australia \n\nand South Africa) showed that galls only developed on A. longifolia. Although frequently considered \n\nas the most sustainable and environmentally friendly methodology around the world, biological \n\ncontrol of invasive plants has only been used once in Europe, in early 2010. The implications of the \n\nresults of the screening tests are discussed and an overview of the legal procedures needed to \n\nsecure release of T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal is presented. \n\nSynthesis: Despite the profound impacts of A. longifolia invasion on native vegetation and on seed \n\nbanks, plant species recovery observed in the field and also soil seed bank studies showed that the \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n\ndune ecosystem is still resilient to some extent. Nevertheless, system degradation is striking and \n\nincreases with time of invasion. The risk of reinvasion is high and long-lasting, due to the numerous \n\nlong-lived seeds of A. longifolia. The results of this investigation emphasize the need for \n\nmanagement actions that are sustainable in the long-term, and indicate that this can be achieved \n\nwith biological control by an agent that primarily targets reduction of A. longifolia seed production. \n\n\n\n \n\nviii \n\n\n\n \n\nix \n\nRESUMO \n\nA invas\u00e3o por esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas \u00e9 considerada uma das principais amea\u00e7as \u00e0 biodiversidade \u00e0 \n\nescala global, com graves impactes ambientais e econ\u00f3micos. O ramo da ecologia que se dedica ao \n\nestudo das invas\u00f5es biol\u00f3gicas surgiu h\u00e1 pouco mais de meio s\u00e9culo, mas tem adquirido uma \n\nnotoriedade crescente, tanto a n\u00edvel da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica como a n\u00edvel dos projectos de gest\u00e3o \n\ndos problemas causados pelas esp\u00e9cies invasoras. O n\u00famero de publica\u00e7\u00f5es especializadas, assim \n\ncomo os projectos de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e de gest\u00e3o, tem aumentado de forma substancial e t\u00eam sido \n\norganizadas iniciativas diversas a todos os n\u00edveis de abrang\u00eancia.

(ac\u00e1cia-de-espigas), \u00e1rvore \n\nde origem Australiana, \u00e9 uma das esp\u00e9cies mais problem\u00e1ticas em Portugal, sendo a sua expans\u00e3o \n\nparticularmente preocupante nos ecossistemas dunares. \u00c9 neste contexto que se apresenta este \n\nestudo sobre a invas\u00e3o da Reserva Natural das Dunas de S. Jacinto por A. longifolia, cujos \n\nobjectivos gerais s\u00e3o: 1) avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos impactes de A. longifolia a n\u00edvel da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, incluindo o \n\nbanco de sementes, 2) estudo da ecologia das sementes de A. longifolia, 3) an\u00e1lise da capacidade \n\nde recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do ecossistema ap\u00f3s remo\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie invasora, e 4) estudo do agente de \n\ncontrolo biol\u00f3gico Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae (vespa-australiana-formadora-de-galhas) como \n\num m\u00e9todo de controlo alternativo para usar em Portugal contra A. longifolia. \n\nPara avaliar os impactes de A. longifolia a n\u00edvel da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o (cap\u00edtulo 2) monitorizaram-se, ao \n\nlongo de cinco anos (2003-08), \u00e1reas invadidas h\u00e1 mais de 20 anos (acacial antigo), \u00e1reas \n\ninvadidas ap\u00f3s um inc\u00eandio no ver\u00e3o de 1995 (acacial recente) e \u00e1reas de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa, n\u00e3o \n\n\n\n \n\nx \n\ninvadidas. Analisaram-se comparativamente diversos par\u00e2metros: riqueza espec\u00edfica, cobertura \n\nvegetal, \u00edndices de diversidade e de similaridade, curvas de abund\u00e2ncia \u2013 domin\u00e2ncia de diversos \n\natributos funcionais e ecol\u00f3gicos e taxas de substitui\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies. Os resultados mostraram que \n\nos impactes da esp\u00e9cie invasora s\u00e3o significativos ocorrendo, por exemplo, diminui\u00e7\u00e3o significativa \n\nda cobertura de plantas nativas, da diversidade, da equitabilidade e da riqueza espec\u00edfica nas \u00e1reas \n\ninvadidas; adicionalmente, observou-se uma altera\u00e7\u00e3o profunda das esp\u00e9cies presentes implicando \n\nmodifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos atributos funcionais e ecol\u00f3gicos. Registou-se um agravamento dos impactes \u00e0 \n\nmedida que o tempo de invas\u00e3o aumenta, i.e., nas \u00e1reas de acacial antigo (e.g. diminui\u00e7\u00e3o mais \n\nacentuada da cobertura vegetal nativa nas \u00e1reas de acacial antigo e menor similaridade da \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies entre \u00e1reas de acacial antigo e as \u00e1reas nativas). Por outro lado, verificou-\n\nse que o potencial de reinvas\u00e3o, devido \u00e0 germina\u00e7\u00e3o de sementes de A. longifolia, aumentou nas \n\n\u00e1reas invadidas h\u00e1 mais tempo. Os ecossistemas dunares em estudo, caracterizados no estado n\u00e3o \n\ninvadido pela exist\u00eancia de diversas comunidades vegetais onde dominam esp\u00e9cies herb\u00e1ceas, \n\nsubarbustivas e arbustivas, foram substitu\u00eddos por forma\u00e7\u00f5es arb\u00f3reas, quase monoespec\u00edficas, \n\nimplicando uma s\u00e9rie de transforma\u00e7\u00f5es a n\u00edvel da pr\u00f3pria estrutura das comunidades e do seu \n\nfuncionamento. Estas transforma\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o din\u00e2micas ao longo do tempo, conforme revelado pelas \n\ntaxas de substitui\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies, e tendem a estabilizar nas \u00e1reas invadidas h\u00e1 v\u00e1rias d\u00e9cadas. \n\nNo conjunto, a an\u00e1lise dos v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros revelou tamb\u00e9m que o uso isolado de par\u00e2metros \n\nexpressos apenas por um valor (e.g. riqueza espec\u00edfica, cobertura vegetal) pode induzir em algumas \n\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00f5es menos correctas. A quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o das altera\u00e7\u00f5es ocorridas devido \u00e0 invas\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\nessencial, por exemplo, para complementar as an\u00e1lises de risco que podem fundamentar a \n\nclassifica\u00e7\u00e3o oficial de A. longifolia como \u201cpraga\u201d no \u00e2mbito Europeu (Council Directive 2000/29/EC), \n\nou para prioritizar \u00e1reas para gest\u00e3o. \n\nCom o objectivo de contribuir para o maior conhecimento da ecologia das sementes de A. longifolia \n\n(cap\u00edtulo 3), procedeu-se \u00e0 quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o da queda de sementes (atrav\u00e9s da instala\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\narmadilhas de sementes), da viabilidade das sementes ao longo de um per\u00edodo de seis anos \n\n(atrav\u00e9s de experi\u00eancias de enterramento de sementes a diferentes profundidades) e da extens\u00e3o \n\ndo banco de sementes acumulado no solo (atrav\u00e9s da recolha de amostras de solo). Os resultados \n\nobtidos mostraram que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o anual de sementes de A. longifolia \u00e9 elevada (12 000 \n\nsementes.m-2 em m\u00e9dia); as sementes acumulam-se sobretudo debaixo das copas das \u00e1rvores-\n\nm\u00e3e e apresentam, logo ap\u00f3s a queda, germinabilidade (i.e. germina\u00e7\u00e3o sem receberem nenhum \n\nest\u00edmulo) da ordem dos 30-40% e viabilidade superior a 80%. Algumas sementes foram detectadas \n\na 7 m da margem do acacial, sugerindo a interven\u00e7\u00e3o de agentes de dispers\u00e3o externos. Muitas \n\n\n\n \n\nxi \n\nsementes s\u00e3o, no entanto, perdidas, tanto antes como depois de entrarem no banco de sementes \n\n(e.g. devido a germina\u00e7\u00e3o, granivoria ou decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o), resultando em valores m\u00e9dios de ca. 1500 \n\ne 500 sementes.m-2 acumuladas no solo de \u00e1reas de acacial antigo e de acacial recente, \n\nrespectivamente. Apesar da perda significativa das sementes, as que s\u00e3o efectivamente \n\nacumuladas no banco de sementes s\u00e3o ainda numerosas sendo suficientes para reinvadir as \u00e1reas \n\nquando estas s\u00e3o sujeitas a alguma perturba\u00e7\u00e3o (e.g. ac\u00e7\u00f5es de controlo, fogo). As sementes de \n\nA. longifolia acumuladas no banco de sementes das \u00e1reas de acacial antigo revelaram \n\ngerminabilidades surpreendentemente baixas (&lt;5%) quando comparadas com as de bancos de \n\nsementes das \u00e1reas de acacial recente (ca. 65%). Um padr\u00e3o semelhante, apesar da diferen\u00e7a ser \n\nmenos acentuada, verificou-se para a viabilidade (ca. 70% vs. quase 100% em \u00e1reas de acacial \n\nantigo e de acacial recente, respectivamente). As sementes enterradas experimentalmente, foram \n\ndesaparecendo ao longo do tempo e ao fim dos seis anos apenas ca. 30% das sementes foram \n\nrecuperadas; as sementes enterradas mais profundamente (ca. 9 cm) foram recuperadas em maior \n\nquantidade. A germinabilidade destas sementes foi baixa (&lt;12%) mas a sua viabilidade foi muito \n\nelevada (> 85%). Estes resultados permitiram a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do potencial de invas\u00e3o de \n\nA. longifolia fundamental para o planeamento das ac\u00e7\u00f5es de gest\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie invasora. \n\nO potencial de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas de acacial antigo e de acacial recente foi avaliado recorrendo \n\na duas abordagens distintas: 1. avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da constitui\u00e7\u00e3o do banco de sementes (esp\u00e9cies nativas e \n\nex\u00f3ticas) atrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo de emerg\u00eancia de pl\u00e2ntulas, em parcelas de onde A. longifolia foi \n\nremovida juntamente com a camada de folhada e em parcelas n\u00e3o intervencionadas (cap\u00edtulo 4); 2. \n\nmonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da recupera\u00e7\u00e3o flor\u00edstica desde 2002 a 2008 (constituindo um per\u00edodo mais longo do \n\nque maior parte dos estudos similares) em \u00e1reas de onde A. longifolia foi removida \n\nexperimentalmente, com ou sem a camada de folhada acumulada \u00e0 superf\u00edcie do solo (cap\u00edtulo 5). \n\nOs resultados das duas experi\u00eancias revelaram que o sistema invadido ainda \u00e9 resiliente, com \n\nmuitas esp\u00e9cies de plantas nativas a suportar a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o autog\u00e9nica parcial, apesar da \n\nresili\u00eancia ser menor em \u00e1reas de acacial antigo. No entanto, muitas das esp\u00e9cies nativas que \n\ncolonizaram as \u00e1reas s\u00e3o generalistas (n\u00e3o exclusivas do sistema dunar e algumas at\u00e9 associadas \n\na ambiente perturbados) e seis anos ap\u00f3s a remo\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie invasora v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies t\u00edpicas, e \n\nalguns atributos mais frequentes, das comunidades dunares eram muito escassos ou n\u00e3o (re) \n\napareceram de todo. Por outro lado, a germina\u00e7\u00e3o de A. longifolia, assim como de outras esp\u00e9cies \n\nex\u00f3ticas, amea\u00e7aram o sucesso da recupera\u00e7\u00e3o alertando para a necessidade de continuidade das \n\nac\u00e7\u00f5es de gest\u00e3o. Os resultados do m\u00e9todo de emerg\u00eancia de pl\u00e2ntulas, parecem indicar uma \n\nmaior degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema comparativamente com a observada nas parcelas em campo; \n\n\n\n \n\nxii \n\ncontudo, este m\u00e9todo revelou sementes de A. longifolia em \u00e1reas n\u00e3o-invadidas, o que n\u00e3o \n\naconteceu nas parcelas em campo, e permitiu uma an\u00e1lise mais r\u00e1pida da capacidade de \n\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema sem a necessidade de um grande esfor\u00e7o/investimento em controlo. Por \n\noutro lado, a monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de longo - prazo em campo, permitiu informa\u00e7\u00e3o mais detalhada do \n\npotencial de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o, revelando cerca do dobro das esp\u00e9cies detectadas no banco de \n\nsementes; no entanto, \u00e9 uma metodologia mais dispendiosa, trabalhosa e que demora mais tempo \n\nat\u00e9 obter resultados. A remo\u00e7\u00e3o da camada de folhada (particularmente em \u00e1reas de acacial antigo) \n\nnas parcelas experimentais revelou-se vantajosa uma vez que, al\u00e9m de facilitar a germina\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmais esp\u00e9cies, contribuiu para eliminar muitas sementes de A. longifolia. Apesar de distintas, as \n\nduas abordagens complementaram-se permitindo uma an\u00e1lise mais completa da capacidade de \n\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema. A an\u00e1lise do potencial de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema \u00e9 fundamental para a \n\ndefini\u00e7\u00e3o das ac\u00e7\u00f5es de gest\u00e3o futuras, incluindo em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de um agente de controlo \n\nbiol\u00f3gico. \n\nOs resultados dos cap\u00edtulos anteriores revelaram que o sucesso das ac\u00e7\u00f5es de controlo \u00e9 \n\nrapidamente comprometido devido ao numeroso banco de sementes de A. longifolia, pelo que o \n\ncontrolo mec\u00e2nico por si s\u00f3 n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma alternativa eficaz. Uma op\u00e7\u00e3o a considerar para a redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda produ\u00e7\u00e3o de sementes \u00e9 a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de agentes de controlo biol\u00f3gico. Apesar do controlo \n\nbiol\u00f3gico ser considerado frequentemente como uma das metodologias mais sustent\u00e1vel e \u201camiga-\n\ndo-ambiente\u201d, a n\u00edvel mundial, esta tecnologia aplicada a plantas invasoras foi usada apenas uma \n\nvez na Europa, com a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o em 2010 do psil\u00eddeo Aphalara itadori, para controlo da \n\nsanguin\u00e1ria-do-Jap\u00e3o (Fallopia japonica (Houtt) R. Decr.) no Reino Unido. No caso da A. longifolia, \n\no agente de controlo biol\u00f3gico Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae \u00e9 reconhecido como sendo mono-\n\nespec\u00edfico (i.e. capaz de completar o seu ciclo de vida apenas em A. longifolia) e reduz \n\nsignificativamente a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de sementes de A. longifolia, al\u00e9m de diminuir, at\u00e9 certo n\u00edvel, o seu \n\ncrescimento vegetativo. Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae \u00e9 usado com sucesso na \u00c1frica do Sul, \n\nonde foi introduzido h\u00e1 mais de 20 anos, e foi testado como uma alternativa para usar em Portugal \n\n(cap\u00edtulo 6). Os resultados dos testes de especificidade realizados, incluindo 40 esp\u00e9cies de plantas \n\nn\u00e3o-alvo, indicaram que T. acaciaelongifoliae pode ser uma alternativa segura (e mais econ\u00f3mica) \n\naos m\u00e9todos de controlo de A. longifolia actualmente dispon\u00edveis em Portugal. Testes de oviposi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsem-escolha revelaram deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de ovos em tr\u00eas esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o-alvo. Fases subsequentes das \n\nexperi\u00eancias, em plantas envasadas (em laborat\u00f3rio) e observa\u00e7\u00f5es em campo (na Austr\u00e1lia e na \n\n\u00c1frica do Sul), mostraram que apenas se desenvolveram galhas, i.e., o agente conseguiu concluir o \n\nseu ciclo de vida, em A. longifolia. Os dados dos estudos atr\u00e1s referidos (nomeadamente a \n\n\n\n \n\nxiii \n\nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos impactes e a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da produ\u00e7\u00e3o, viabilidade e banco de sementes de \n\nA. longifolia) s\u00e3o indispens\u00e1veis para avaliar futuramente o grau de sucesso do agente de controlo \n\nbiol\u00f3gico, caso a sua liberta\u00e7\u00e3o venha a ser autorizada. Discutem-se as implica\u00e7\u00f5es da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndesta metodologia e apresenta-se um resumo dos procedimentos legais necess\u00e1rios antes da sua \n\nliberta\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nS\u00edntese: apesar da invas\u00e3o por A. longifolia ter impactes profundos na vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o nativa e no \n\npr\u00f3prio banco de sementes, a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies vegetais observada em campo e prevista \n\natrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise do banco de sementes, revelaram que o sistema dunar em estudo ainda \u00e9 \n\nresiliente. No entanto, a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema dunar \u00e9 significativa e agrava-se com o aumento do \n\ntempo de invas\u00e3o. Acresce que esta degrada\u00e7\u00e3o se repercute tamb\u00e9m num risco de reinvas\u00e3o que \n\n\u00e9 elevado devido ao banco de sementes da esp\u00e9cie invasora que, al\u00e9m de numeroso, tem \n\nviabilidade longa. Os resultados deste trabalho refor\u00e7am a necessidade de combater o problema de \n\ninvas\u00e3o por A. longifolia com ac\u00e7\u00f5es de gest\u00e3o de longo-prazo. Adicionalmente, indicam que uma \n\ndas metodologias de controlo poss\u00edveis para A. longifolia \u00e9 a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do agente de controlo \n\nbiol\u00f3gico T. acaciaelongifoliae, o qual se prev\u00ea que diminua a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de sementes de forma \n\nsignificativa e contribua para reduzir o seu crescimento vegetativo, de forma ambientalmente segura \n\ne economicamente sustent\u00e1vel. \n\n\n\n \n\nxiv \n\n\n\n \n\nxv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         To Tom\u00e1s and Matias \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nxvi \n\n\n\n \n\nxvii \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nAlone I would have never been able to undertake this work!  \n\nSozinha nunca teria sido capaz de fazer este trabalho! \n\nThere are many people to whom I would like to express my sincere thanks: \n\nH\u00e1 muitas pessoas \u00e0s quais quero expressar os meus sinceros agradecimentos: \n\n \n\nJohn Hoffmann, for accepting me as his PhD student and introducing me to the \u201cbiocontrol world\u201d, for \n\nreceiving me so well during my travels to Cape Town and for all he has taught me. \n\nHelena Freitas, por me ter aceite como sua doutoranda, por me encorajar a continuar e estimular-\n\nme a querer ir mais longe na minha caminhada cient\u00edfica. \n\n\u201cField and lab. people\u201d, que por uma ou mais vezes me ajudaram ao longo dos seis anos de \n\ntrabalho e que contribu\u00edram para que as sa\u00eddas de campo e as horas no laborat\u00f3rio fossem sempre \n\nt\u00e3o agrad\u00e1veis: Ana Torrinha, Carla Gairifo, Cristina Morais, Elizabete Marchante, Erika Buscardo, \n\nGilberto Silva, Jos\u00e9 Maia, Lurdes Barrico, Rui Vaz e Vitor Carvalho. \n\nJo\u00e3o Cris\u00f3stomo, Kris French and Natalie Sullivan (in Australia), Fiona Impson, Carien Kleinjan, \n\nReley Labahn and John Hoffmann (in South Africa) for gall searching in the field. \n\n\u201cStatistical people\u201d, for their patience and for sharing their knowledge: Veneranda Batalha, Rob Mars \n\nand Nuno Sousa. \n\nM.

In order to make the geographic \n\ncontext of the problem, the situation is characterized in Europe and then in Portugal. A particular \n\nimportance is then given to IAS management as one of the underlying goals of this work is to provide \n\nuseful information for managers. Finally, the species and the ecosystem in study are characterized. \n\nSubjects that are depicted in detail in each of the five main chapters were in most cases excluded in \n\norder to avoid much repetition. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nINVASIVE SPECIES: AN OVERVIEW \n\nState of the art  \n\nBiological invasions mediated by human activities are a huge source of change in ecosystems, with \n\nescalating impacts, both ecological and economic, worldwide (Brooks et al., 2004; Rejm\u00e1nek et al., \n\n2005; Mason, French &amp; Russell, 2007; Yelenik, Stock &amp; Richardson, 2007; Batten, Scow &amp; \n\nEspeland, 2008; Marchante et al., 2008b; Gaertner et al., 2009; J\u00e4ger, Kowarik &amp; Tye, 2009; Pejchar \n\n&amp; Mooney, 2010; Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010; Vil\u00e1 et al., 2010), often resulting in an \u201cinvasional \n\nmeltdown\u201d 1 (sensu Simberloff &amp; Von Holle, 1999). The origin of biological invasions is lost in time \n\nwith some authors pointing to Late Devonian (Stigall, 2010). Nevertheless, it has increased \n\nconsistently under human-mediation, reaching a peak in the second half of the 20th century (Py\u0161ek &amp; \n\nRichardson, 2010) when it gained \u201cformal\u201d recognition in the late 1950s with the pioneering work of \n\nCharles Elton (Elton, 1958), often considered as the \u201cfather of Invasion Biology\u201d (Richardson &amp; \n\nPy\u0161ek, 2008). Scientists, politicians and Global Organizations (Minist\u00e9rio do Ambiente, 1999; \n\nMillennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; Commission of the European Communities, 2008; \n\nISSG/IUCN, 2008; Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010; TEEB, 2010) all recognize that invasive species \n\ndamage ecosystem services, disrupt human well-being and threaten biodiversity. Ecosystem \n\nservices affected by invasive species include supporting (e.g. alteration of succession patterns and \n\nsoil and nutrient cycling), provisioning (e.g. threats to native species, alteration of genetic resources), \n\nregulating (e.g. changing pollination services and fire regimes) and cultural services (e.g. effects on \n\necotourism, changes in perception of landscape) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; Vil\u00e1 et \n\nal., 2010). The alterations that occur at one trophic level may have repercussions into several other \n\ntrophic levels (e.g. alterations in plant communities affect herbivores and parasitoids which are \n\ninterlinked in food webs) amplifying the more frequently measured impacts of invasive alien species \n\n(IAS) (Carvalheiro, Buckley &amp; Memmott, 2010). \n\nInvasive species are reported to rank as the second agent of species endangerment and extinction \n\n(Pejchar &amp; Mooney, 2010). Nevertheless, and despite the unquestionably extensive and profound \n\nimpacts of IAS, there is no quantitative data that supports this universal ranking. Such level of threat \n\nhas been justified for particular systems and taxonomic groups, where invasive species may even be  \n\n Invasional meltdown refers to the interactions among invaders that accelerate invasions and amplify their effects on \n\nnative communities \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nthe predominant threat (Miller, 1989; Wilcove et al., 1998). On a global scale, it is more correct to \n\ninclude biological invasions amongst the five mains causes of biodiversity decline (Millennium \n\nEcosystem Assessment, 2005).  \n\nInvasive alien species (see Table 1.1 for definitions) are found amongst all living organisms, \n\nincluding many plants, animals and microrganisms (Elton, 1958; Vitousek, 2001; Perrings, Mooney &amp; \n\nWilliamson, 2010). Some of those species are \u201cborn\u201d invaders (i.e. without major limitations on their \n\nadaptation to new environments) others are \u201cmade\u201d invaders (i.e. evolve after being introduced in the \n\nnew environment in order to adapt and become more fit) (Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). This work \n\nfocuses on invasive plants, in particular the Leguminosae tree Acacia longifolia. \n\nTable 1.1 Main concepts and definitions used in plant invasion biology (source Richardson et al., 2000). \nConcept  Definition  \n\nExotic, alien, aloctonous, \nnon-native, non-\nindigenous \n \n\nPlant taxa whose presence in a given area is due to introduction, intentional or \naccidental, as a result of human activity. \n\nCasual, occasional \nescape, transient \n \n\nSubset of alien plants that may flourish, and even reproduce occasionally in an \narea, but which do not form self-replacing populations, and which rely on \nrepeated introductions to persist. \n \n\nNaturalized, sub- \nspontaneous \n\nSubset of alien plant that reproduce consistently and sustain populations over \nmany life cycles without direct intervention by humans (or in spite of human \nintervention); often recruit offspring freely, usually close to adult plants, and do \nnot necessarily spread into natural, semi-natural or human-made ecosystems. \n \n\nInvasive, environmental \nweed \n\nSubset of naturalized plants that produce reproductive offspring, often in very \nlarge numbers, at considerable distances from parent plants (approximate \nscales: > 100 m; &lt;50 years for taxa spreading by seeds and other propagules; \n> 6 m/3 years for taxa spreading by roots, rhizomes, stolons, or creeping \nstems), and thus have the potential to spread over a considerable area; \nfrequently adversely affecting native biodiversity and/or ecosystem functioning. \n \n\nTransformer   Subset of invasive plants which change the character, condition, form or nature \nof ecosystems over a substantial area relative to the extent of that ecosystem. \n \n\nWeeds, plant pests, \nharmful species \n\nPlants (not necessarily exotic) that grow in sites where they are not wanted by \nhumans and which usually have detectable economic or environmental effects.  \n\n \n\nInvasive alien species are a small fraction of exotic species that are increasingly moved around the \n\nworld, intentionally or accidentally, crossing geographic barriers (and then a series of environmental \n\nand other barriers, see Figure 1.5 and Richardson et al. (2000) for more details) that had once \n\nlimited their distribution to their natural ranges. Often, such species are moved without carrying the \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nnatural enemies that in their native environment are one of the factors contributing to keeping them \n\nin check - enemy release hypothesis ERH (Keane &amp; Crawley, 2002). ERH when associated with \n\nsome species traits, e.g. prolific seed production, efficient mechanisms of dispersal, high growth \n\nrates, plasticity, altogether facilitate a plant species becoming invasive. Some invasive species are \n\nable to significantly modify the ecosystems over a substantial area; these are named transformers \n\n(Richardson et al., 2000). \n\nSome of the characteristics of the species, e.g. prolific production of seeds which accumulate in \n\nlong-lived, viable seed banks, are particularly important, because besides being responsible for initial \n\ninvasion they ensure persistence into the future by allowing resurgence after control efforts or other \n\nforms of disturbance. Whether a species is invasive or not depends not only on the characteristics of \n\nthe species but also on the characteristics of the new environment itself including factors such as \n\nresources availability, levels of antagonist species (e.g. predators, herbivores, pathogens) and \n\nintactness of the system. Propagule pressure (i.e. introduction effort), other human activities \n\n(reflected in variables such as Human wealth and demography), and intensity of disturbance (Essl et \n\nal., 2010; Perrings, Mooney &amp; Williamson, 2010; Py\u0161ek et al., 2010) can also play an important role \n\nin the process of whether or not a species will become invasive.  \n\nAlthough some ecosystems are intrinsically more susceptible to invasion than others, disturbance, \n\nfragmentation and changes in land-use are known to greatly increase ecosystems vulnerability to \n\ninvasion, even with the same activity affecting different ecosystems types in distinct ways (Py\u0161ek, \n\nChytr\u00fd &amp; Vojtech, 2010). Other authors (Blossey &amp; Notzold, 1995) noted another factor, expressed \n\nas the EICA (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability) hypothesis, according to which, species, \n\nafter introduced into a new location, evolve and adapt to the new environment being able to \n\nreallocate resources in order to gain competitive advantage. This hypothesis makes it more difficult \n\nto predict which species will became invasive because unpredicted evolution, following introduction, \n\ncan make a difference. \n\nThe time lag between the introduction of a species and the revelation of its invasive behaviour can \n\nbe extremely variable. Even so, a recent study highlights that many of the most problematic invasive \n\nspecies (for all major taxonomic groups) are species that were introduced several decades ago, \n\ncalling it an \u201cinvasion debt\u201d and alerting to the fact that current human activities (including \n\nglobalization and economic growth) will have their consequences on the extent of biological \n\ninvasions several decades into the future (Essl et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nThe economic and ecological dimensions of biological invasions are interconnected and are far \n\nreaching. The changes in ecosystems that frequently increase their susceptibility to invasion impacts \n\n(e.g. disturbance, habitat fragmentation) are frequently economically mediated; and the resulting \n\necological impacts (normally considered as externalities to the economic activities and as such not \n\ntaken into account by its promoters) have direct implications on the \u201cnatural capital\u201d with \n\nrepercussions which are manifest as economical problems. An increasing number of regional trade \n\nagreements (more than 420 reported to the World Trade Organization) aim to reduce barriers to \n\nmovement of commodities and people, associated with increased trade, transport and travel all over \n\nthe world (as a result of globalization). Although these agreements have many benefits for human \n\nwell-being, they are increasingly facilitating the introduction of more species (some new, others \n\nalready problematic), and consequently increasing probabilities of establishment and dispersal of \n\nsuch species (Perrings, Mooney &amp; Williamson, 2010). Additional problems arise from the ever-\n\nincreasing online trade, which facilitates unregulated movement of species, including invasives, to \n\nvirtually every part of the globe (Derraik &amp; Phillips, 2010). \n\nEconomic impacts of IAS, measured so far, include mainly management costs and also losses to \n\nprovisioning ecosystem services (Pimentel, Zuniga &amp; Morrison, 2005; Pejchar &amp; Mooney, 2010; Vil\u00e1 \n\net al., 2010). Some of these costs could be partially balanced /attenuated if probability of success of \n\ncostly management options was first evaluated, in a systematic manner, in order to weigh the \n\npossibility of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d against the management actions and thus avoiding some of the huge \n\nfunding efforts in systems without clear chances of success. \n\nBesides environmental and economic effects of IAS, cultural impacts, centred in human uses and \n\ntraditions, are quite diverse being possible to find invasive species culturally impoverishing (i.e. imply \n\nloss or replacement of culturally important native species), culturally enriching (i.e. augment cultural \n\ntraditions), or culturally facilitating (i.e. continuity and reformulation of traditional ethnobiological \n\npractices) (Pfeiffer &amp; Voeks, 2008). When considering management of invasive species, all these \n\ndimensions of impacts have to be balanced in an integrative way. \n\n \n\nInvasive alien species in Europe - where do we stand? \n\n\u201cInvasive alien species are currently among the most urgent nature conservation issues to be faced \n\nin the European Union and many important steps are being undertaken to develop an adequate \n\nstrategy to deal with this problem\u201d in Scalera (2010) \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nEurope in general was perceived until recently as being a major source of invasive species for other \n\nregions of the world but not receiving many species nor having major problems with invasive \n\nspecies. This concept has changed greatly after a continent wide assessment made by the DAISIE \n\nproject (http://www.europe-aliens.org/). DAISIE revealed over 11 000 alien species reported \n\nincluding terrestrial plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, freshwater and marine flora and fauna. Of \n\nthese, over half of the species are terrestrial plants. A recent assessment aiming to foresee the \n\ndistributions of invasive species across habitats in Europe, predicted that the highest levels of \n\ninvasion occur in disturbed habitats (agricultural, urban and industrial land-cover classes), while low \n\nlevels occur in natural and semi-natural grasslands and woodlands, and the lowest levels in \n\nsclerophyllous vegetation, heathlands and peatlands (Chytr\u00fd et al., 2009). The same study predicted \n\nthat lowland areas of the temperate zone of western and central Europe have high levels of invasion \n\nwhile boreal zone, mountain regions across the Europe and Mediterranean region (except its \n\ncoastline, river corridors and areas with irrigated agricultural land) have low levels of invasion.  \n\nA rough assessment of impacts, continental wide, estimated that financial costs are over \u20ac10 billion \n\nannually (Hulme et al., 2009), including mainly management costs, such as eradication, control, \n\nmonitoring and environmental education programs, and also losses to provisioning ecosystem \n\nservices (Vil\u00e1 et al., 2010). Approximately 300 projects addressing IAS have been funded by the \n\nEuropean Commission (EC), over the last 15 years, with a total budget exceeding \u20ac132 million \n\n(Scalera, 2010). These included projects financed by LIFE Programme and Framework Programmes \n\nfor Research and Technological Development (FPs), with a higher investment on research than on \n\nmanagement actions. Terrestrial plants and invertebrates include the majority of species with \n\nimpacts although economic and environmental impacts are known for only 11-13% of the species \n\n(documented ecological impacts for 1094 species and economic impacts for 1347 species, including \n\nall taxonomic groups (Vil\u00e1 et al., 2010).  \n\nInvasive plants, in particular, have more ecological impacts reported in Europe than economic \n\nimpacts, because of difficulty in to attributing market-based costs to ecological impacts measured.  \n\nAlthough there are several commitments and agreements underpinned by international European \n\norganizations (e.g. EPPO and the EU itself), a specific European strategy and dedicated financial \n\ninstrument targeting IAS is still missing (Scalera, 2010). Little has translated into action (e.g. \n\nprevention of new introductions, successful management actions) and IAS problems keep increasing \n\n(Hulme et al., 2009). Several issues make it difficult for Europe to achieve such action at a \n\ncontinental scale; e.g., the single market policy that removed the barriers to movement of \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\ncommodities and people, the lack of a \u201cEuropean species blacklist\u201d that would have to consider \n\nregional lists (as many species are native in some European countries while exotic in others e.g. \n\nRhododendron ponticum L. which is native in Portugal and invasive in the UK) and climatic zones (as \n\nsome species are invasive in some areas but are climatically constrained in others). Lack of \n\ninformation for the majority of the species also complicate efforts because would be needed for \n\ncomplete risk assessments that would allow listing some of the worst species as \u201cofficial pests\u201d \n\n(Council Directive 2000/29/EC). \n\n \n\nPortugal in more detail \n\nThere are over 820 exotic species in Portugal, including terrestrial and aquatic animals and plants \n\nand fungi; exotic terrestrial plants and insects are the most numerous (Table 1.2) (DAISIE, 2008). \n\nAmongst these, many are invasive and perceived as widespread and causing major ecological \n\n(Almeida &amp; Freitas, 2001; Marchante, 2001; Campos, Rocha &amp; Tavares, 2002; Aguiar et al., 2005; \n\nAnast\u00e1cio, Parente &amp; Correia, 2005; Fernandes, 2008; Marchante et al., 2008b, a; Sousa et al., \n\n2008; Hellmann et al., 2010) and economic impacts (Scalera &amp; Zaghi, 2004). Invasive species are \n\nlegally recognized since 1999 by Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 565/99 de 21 de Dezembro, which forbids the use \n\nof species that are listed as invasive. The list of species needs to be updated as several problematic \n\ninvasive species are not yet included. Controversially, other legal instruments seem to neglect the \n\nproblem, e.g. some exotic invasive species such as Paspalum spp. have a conservation status due \n\nto be considered indicators of habitats protected by Natura 2000 Network (Decreto-Lei n\u00ba 140/99 de \n\n24 de Abril \u2013 Anexo B-1; Directiva 92/43/CEE \u2013 Anexo I).  \n\nTable 1.2 Exotic species registered in Portugal, distributed by major taxonomical categories (based on \ninformation from DAISIE (2008); Almeida and Freitas (2006) and our own records on plant species).  \n\nTerrestrial \nfungi \n\n Aquatic \ninland \n\n Terrestrial \nplants \n\n Terrestrial \ninvertebrates \n\n Terrestrial \nvertebrates \n\nTotal of exotic \nspecies \n\nF\nu\nn\ng\ni \n\nC\nh\nro\nm\nis\nta\n \n\n C\nru\nst\na\nce\n\na\n \n\nM\na\ng\nn\no\nlio\n\np\nh\nyt\na\n \n\n M\na\ng\nn\no\nlio\n\np\nh\nyt\na\n \n\nB\nry\no\np\nh\nyt\na\n \n\n O\nth\ne\nr \na\nrt\nh\nro\np\no\nd\ns \n\nA\nra\nn\ne\na\ne\n \n\nN\ne\nm\na\nto\nd\na\n \n\nIn\nse\n\nct\na\n \n\n A\nve\n\ns \n\nR\ne\np\ntil\nia\n \n\nM\na\nm\nm\na\nlia\n\n \n\n \n\n13 3  2 2  557 2  1 7 3 208  24 3 2 827 \n\n \n\nSome of the more widespread and injurious invasive animals in Portugal are the Louisiana crayfish \n\n(Procambarus clarkii), pinewood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) and the Asian clam \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n(Corbicula fluminea) (Anast\u00e1cio, Parente &amp; Correia, 2005; Naves, Camacho &amp; de Sousa, 2006; \n\nSousa et al., 2008). Invasive plants are more numerous than animals, and probably better studied, \n\nwith invasive plant species publications becoming increasingly more frequent (Marchante, Marchante \n\n&amp; Freitas, 2003; Peperkorn, Werner &amp; Beyschlag, 2005; Aguiar, Ferreira &amp; Albuquerque, 2006; \n\nAlmeida &amp; Freitas, 2006; Aguiar et al., 2007; Ferreira, M\u00e1guas &amp; Martins-Lou\u00e7\u00e3o, 2007; Rodr\u00edguez-\n\nEcheverr\u00eda, Cris\u00f3stomo &amp; Freitas, 2007; Fernandes, 2008; Marchante et al., 2008b, 2009), including \n\nseveral studies quantifying impacts at different levels. Compared with other European countries, \n\nPortugal has more invasive tree species than most of the northern countries (DAISIE, 2008), which \n\nsometimes results in more extreme changes at the landscapes. \n\nOver 550 exotic plant species (including only casuals, naturalized and invasive) are considered to be \n\nintroduced in Portugal (Almeida &amp; Freitas, 2006), being rather well characterized regarding \n\nintroduction time and pathways, native range and taxonomy (Almeida, 1999; Marchante, Freitas &amp; \n\nMarchante, 2008). Their native ranges include regions all around the world, with over 70 species \n\noriginating from each of the Americas\u2019, Eurasia; other regions of Europe and Africa (Almeida, 1999). \n\nNevertheless, Australasia despite being the native range of fewer species, is home to a substantial \n\nproportion of the most problematic species in Portugal, such as Acacia spp., Hakea spp. and \n\nPittosporum undulatum Vent. (Santo &amp; Ars\u00e9nio, 1999; Campos, Rocha &amp; Tavares, 2002; Fernandes, \n\n2008; Marchante, Freitas &amp; Marchante, 2008). \n\nMost of the exotic plant species (ca. 50%) were introduced as ornamentals (Figure 1.1), with \n\nagri/horticulture also accounting for a substantial number of introductions. This pathway is still \n\n\u201cactive\u201d with new species being introduced every year. About 1/6 of the species were accidentally \n\nintroduced, which corresponds to numerous cases of agricultural weeds whose seeds were acquired \n\nunintentionally with crop seeds (Almeida &amp; Freitas, 2000). \n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n\nA\ncc\n\nid\nen\n\nta\nl\n\nA\ngr\n\ni/H\nor\n\nti-\ncu\n\nltu\nra\n\nl\n\nA\nm\n\nen\nity\n\nE\nro\n\nsi\non\n\nco\nnt\n\nro\nl\n\n(d\nun\n\ne)\n\nF\nor\n\nes\ntr\n\ny\n\nM\ned\n\nic\nin\n\nal\n\nO\nrn\n\nam\nen\n\nta\nl\n\nS\nee\n\nd\nco\n\nnt\nam\n\nin\nan\n\nt\n\nO\nth\n\ner\n \n\nno\n. o\n\nf s\npe\n\nci\nes\n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Introduction pathways of the exotic plant species recorded in Portugal.

Species \nstrictly limited to cultivation are nit included.  \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nAmongst the vast taxonomic diversity (110 families) of the exotic plant species present in the \n\ncountry, several families are absent from the Portuguese native flora (e.g. Oxalidaceae, Proteaceae, \n\nPittosporaceae) and many species are grouped in just a few families - Asteraceae, Fabaceae and \n\nPoaceae, each contributing with over (or close to) 10% of the species (Almeida &amp; Freitas, 2006). \n\nExotic plant species occur in a wide range of Portuguese habitats with some of the more humanized \n\nand disturbed habitats (I1 and J4 \u2013 Table 1.3) (Almeida, 1999; H. Marchante et al., unpublished \n\ndata) having more species, reflecting the pattern of plant invasions distribution predicted for Europe \n\n(Chytr\u00fd et al., 2009). Many species are also present in other habitats, including the coastal sand \n\ndunes (48 species) and littoral zone of inland water bodies (70 species) (Moreira et al., 2002; Aguiar, \n\nFerreira &amp; Albuquerque, 2006; Aguiar et al., 2007; Marchante, Freitas &amp; Marchante, 2008). \n\nTable 1.3 Habitats where exotic plant species are present in Portugal, according to the EUNIS classification \n(Almeida, 1999; H.

It integrates many factors (e.g. climate change, \n\nglobalization, species and habitats characteristics, human actions), creates conflict of interests (e.g. \n\nWorld Trade Organization, ornamental commerce, wood industries vs. restrictions to species \n\nutilization due to their invasiveness), involves technical challenges (e.g. control of online trade, \n\nfinding effective control strategies, accurate taxonomic identification) and is aggravated by a \n\ngeneralized lack of public awareness (e.g. who can have active roles, either promoting new \n\nintroductions or controlling existing invasive species), often amongst stakeholders and managers \n\n(Andreu, Vil\u00e1 &amp; Hulme, 2009; Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). As such, management of biological \n\ninvasions demands well planed, integrative actions, designed for several years, frequently even \n\ndecades, with the underlying need of continuous funding (Wittenberg &amp; Cock, 2005). A fundamental \n\nfactor that has to be considered as a baseline on IAS management is habitat disturbance which \n\nfrequently works as a facilitator of invasion (Hulme, 2006) and needs to be mitigated. Research \n\ntargeting effective management practices is also of major importance but, above all, it\u2019s important \n\nthat it reaches managers and is applied in the field, which frequently fails to happen (Hulme, 2006; \n\nAndreu, Vil\u00e1 &amp; Hulme, 2009). Another major issue in invasion biology, which is crucial in all stages of \n\nmanagement, is the accurate identification of species as misidentifications can have very serious \n\nconsequences. \n\nManagement of invasive species should integrate a sequence of \u201ckey steps\u201d, some of them more \n\ncost-effective and promising in terms of achieving lasting and successful results than others, \n\nincluding: (1) prevention; (2) early detection and rapid response; (3) eradication; (4) containment; (5) \n\ncontrol; (6) restoration and mitigation; (7) monitoring and evaluation (Wittenberg &amp; Cock, 2005; \n\nHulme, 2006; Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). Several of these steps are sequential, but not necessarily \n\nall, as some of them may be simultaneously applied (e.g. sequential steps with the subsequent \n\ntaking place when the previous fails 1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4 ? 5 ? 6 ? 7 as opposed to simultaneous \n\napplication of several options 1 ? 2 ? 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 ? 7) (Figure 1.5).  \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nFigure 1. 5 Introduction-invasion continuum (A, C). Amongst all the species introduced only a limited number \n(D) will cross several barriers (B) becoming invasive; if a species establishes successfully it will have impacts \n(E); management actions (F) have to be set according to each invasion phase. Impacts (E) include even \nsubtle changes that result from the species entering the system but that are not always easily perceived. The \nzones of management options (F) are approximate and some may overlap more than represented: e.g. \nprevention is crucial before introduction but may continue afterwards in order to prevent increased spread; \neradication has higher probability of success prior to naturalization but can be achieved in the earliest phase \nof expansion; management options only apply to the species that are or have high potential to be invasive \n(based on Hulme (2006), Grice (2009) and Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson (2010)). \n\nBefore embarking in expensive management options it is essential to prioritize the management \n\nactions, the species and the areas, taking into consideration factors such as the level of impacts, \n\nprobabilities of success, value of ecosystem after recovery and available resources (Hulme, 2006). \n\nThis is not straightforward and it is often additionally complicated by the existence of species in \n\ndistinct stages of invasion, requiring distinct management options to be applied at the same time \n\n(Hulme, 2006; Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). Above all, there are no miraculous solutions and the easy \n\noptions are rare. To achieve suitable levels of success, persistence and, as far as is possible, \n\nscientific-based decisions are essential. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nPrevention \n\nPreventing the introduction of species with high risk of becoming invasive is one of the most cost-\n\neffective management strategies (Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). Several actions are considered in \n\nprevention, such as risk assessment, border interception, pathway and vector management, \n\nlegislative frameworks and public awareness. Some of these options are discussed below; public \n\nawareness is discussed afterwards due to its crucial and transverse role in several other \n\nmanagement options. \n\nRisk assessment of an alien species potentially invasive is the determination of the likelihood that the \n\nspecies might be introduced into a region (intentionally or accidentally), establish itself and become \n\ninvasive (Figure 5) with considerable undesired impacts (Stohlgren &amp; Jarnevich, 2009; Py\u0161ek &amp; \n\nRichardson, 2010). Basically, risk assessment procedures involves information gathering which aims \n\nto characterize the invasiveness of the species, the invasibility of habitats of introduction, the \n\npotential distribution and undesired effects to the environment, human-health and economy \n\n(Stohlgren &amp; Schnase, 2006). If the risk assessment scores a species as representing high risk then \n\naction should be put in place to prevent that species from entering/spreading in the country/region. \n\nWith this aim, risk assessment have been mainly applied pre-border, although it may also be applied \n\nafterwards, e.g. to develop invasion risk maps (Chytr\u00fd et al., 2009) or to prioritize invasive species \n\n(Stohlgren &amp; Jarnevich, 2009). Risk assessment is also one of the procedures frequently needed to \n\nsupport the decision of granting permission to release an exotic biological control agent (EPPO, \n\n2009).  \n\nIncreasing availability of databases of introduced species (e.g. Global Invasive Species Database, \n\nhttp://www.issg.org/database/welcome/; Rod Randall's Big Weed List, http://www.invasive.org/gist/ \n\nbiglist.html) has contributed to increasing accuracy rates of screening procedures. Some of them, \n\ne.g. Australian weed risk assessment (WRA), may be applied almost universally (within taxonomic \n\ngroups), but with some modification needed (Gordon et al., 2008; 2010; McClay et al., 2010). \n\nPrevious history of invasion elsewhere is one of the fundamental components of risk assessment, \n\nalthough screening procedures can identify high risk species which have no previous invasive record \n\n(Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010).  \n\nPathway and vector management is one of the key mechanisms for reducing unwanted introductions \n\n(Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). Identifying the pathways and vectors of introduction and dissemination \n\nof alien species allows adoption of proactive measures (e.g. targeting specific pathways to be \n\nmonitored) that will reduce propagule pressure and consequently the likelihood of establishment and \n\nspread. For instance, one of the major pathways of dispersal for plants is commercial trade in \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nornamental species. Realising this focuses public awareness on finding alternatives for ornamental \n\ninvasive plant species and development of legal frameworks to limit introductions. Nevertheless, \n\npathways are numerous and the enormous volume of trade in commodities makes the goal of \n\nintercepting all the potentially problematic species almost impossible (Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). \n\nWith this in mind it is easy to understand that additional management options are needed for the \n\nspecies that successfully cross this \u201cstage\u201d. \n\nEarly detection and rapid response (EDRR) \n\nFor species that are introduced or keep actively spreading, the most effective way of minimizing \n\nimpacts is to detect new introductions, small invasions or spreading propagules of species already \n\nspread as early as possible, when populations are still localized, and quickly put in place procedures \n\nto eradicate, contain or control them (Holcombe &amp; Stohlgren, 2009). Considering the expansive \n\nrange of organisms that can be introduced and are potentially invasive (from microrganisms to large \n\nplants and animals), the difficulties of accurate taxonomic identification, the difficulty of detecting \n\nindividuals in low numbers and the vast areas that can/need to be monitored, the probabilities of \n\nearly detection of an invasive species are very low (Hulme, 2006; Gordon et al., 2010; Py\u0161ek &amp; \n\nRichardson, 2010). Nevertheless, EDRR is highly cost-effective, justifying major research and \n\nmanagement efforts to improve protocols and techniques. These processes include, for instance, (1) \n\nuse of remote sensing to monitor and map species, (2) modelling potential distribution maps to target \n\nareas with higher probability of incursions, and (3) development of user-friendly identification guides \n\nand high-tech diagnostic tool (e.g. DNA bar-coding ) (Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010).  \n\nEarly detection should set priorities, regarding species (e.g. watch lists) and areas (e.g. habitats with \n\nhigher conservation value or areas that are more prone to invasion) in order to increase efficiency. \n\nSmall invasion foci should be targeted first as they have increased invasion potential, because that \n\nwill more efficiently slow the spread than if expansive populations were targeted (Rejm\u00e1nek &amp; \n\nPitcairn, 2002). Rapid response should start with a quick inventory of the populations which is \n\nessential to avoid missing isolated patches or individuals that can then nullify the possibility of \n\neradication. Additionally, it is essential that the infrastructure is in place, including control strategies, \n\nmonitoring schemes, funding and human resources. Public awareness, including species \n\nidentification skills, can be a major ally (Holcombe &amp; Stohlgren, 2009). \n\nEradication  \n\nEradication is the elimination of all the individuals of a species (including the seed-bank) within the \n\nmanagement unit (e.g. country, conservation area) (Parkes &amp; Panetta, 2009). It is more commonly \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\napplied to species with limited ranges and is a cost-effective option because, if successful, it \n\nprecludes negative impacts before they appear. Nevertheless, it is difficult to implement because \n\nmanagers/ stakeholders frequently cannot be persuaded to act upon species that are not yet a \n\nproblem in their lands/areas (Parkes &amp; Panetta, 2009; Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). \n\nEradication should only be attempted if it is considered to be feasible to avoid failure and associated \n\nwasted effort and financial costs. To be considered feasible, it should ideally meet three criteria: (1) \n\nthe average annual rate of increase of the population should be lower than the average annual long-\n\nterm removal rate, not forgetting that funding has to be guaranteed; (2) there is not a source of new \n\npropagules; and (3) there are not adverse effects of the removal of the species (e.g. increase of \n\nother exotic species) that outweigh the benefits of removing the target plant (Parkes &amp; Panetta, \n\n2009). The potential impacts of the species if not eradicated should also be included in the analysis \n\nof feasibility. Regarding the feasibility of eradication, experiments showed that areas &lt;1 ha are likely \n\nto be eradicated, areas of 1-100 ha are expected to succeed in only about 33% of attempted areas \n\nand for larger areas expected success is low (Rejm\u00e1nek &amp; Pitcairn, 2002). Commonly, costs of \n\ninvasive plants eradication increase exponentially as the area of invasion expands (Parkes &amp; \n\nPanetta, 2009). \n\nOnce eradication is no longer feasible, containment and control are the most obvious options; both \n\nshould be planned and developed as long-term strategies, with special care given to guaranteeing \n\nresources and continued participation of the various stakeholders (Grice, 2009). In general, the \n\nearlier the operations commence the higher is the likelihood of them being successful and the more \n\ncost-effective they become. Prioritization of species and places should be defined but this may be \n\ncomplicated by conflict of interests amongst stakeholders. Several scenarios are possible, from \n\ndirecting efforts to regions with lower abundance of the species (because this is a more cost-\n\neffective option that will avoid, or at least delay, impacts from getting worse) to directing efforts \n\ntoward places with higher abundance of the species, which are already highly degraded, aiming to \n\nprevent spread into surrounding areas. Another alternative is to focus efforts on areas of particular \n\ninterest (e.g. conservation) irrespective of the abundance of the invader or the costs. In such areas a \n\nmultiple invasive species management approach can be considered (Grice, 2009). \n\nContainment  \n\nContainment aims to limit the spread of an invasive species through management strategies applied \n\nto the periphery of its range, in order to prevent its range from reaching its full potential (Kriticos, \n\nAlexander &amp; Kolometz, 2006). Natural barriers to range expansion (e.g. mountains, rivers,\u2026) can \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nand should be exploited. Containment can be considered partial if, instead of limiting spread entirely, \n\nit attempts to slow the rate of spread (Cacho, 2004). In either case, it can be applied to distinct \n\nmanagement units (e.g. country, conservation area) as long as the species is expanding its range \n\nand curtailing its expansion is still a possibility (Grice, 2009). When the area occupied by a species is \n\nvery large and composed of distinct smaller units, the periphery gets larger and the option to control \n\nbecomes more realistic than to contain. Containment is more appropriate to species that disperse \n\nslowly and over short-distances and for which effective barriers can be set in place (Hulme, 2006). A \n\ncontainment programme should include a series of activities such as 1) accurate identification of the \n\nspecies, 2) establishment of a scheme to detect the target species outside the range where it is \n\nbeing contained, 3) planned subsequent activities to remove it if detected, and 4) adequate policies \n\nand proper implementation of species management (Grice, 2009). \n\nControl  \n\nControl activities aim to reduce the impact and the abundance of an invasive species to an \n\nacceptable level in the long-term but, unlike containment, not necessarily limit its range (Hulme, \n\n2006; Grice, 2009). The balance between perceived or predicted impacts as opposed to predicted \n\ncosts of control, the stage of invasion and the availability of effective control measures determine \n\nwhether control is the best option (Grice, 2009). Predicting the impact of a species is also a \n\nfundamental, though difficult, aspect in making the decision for control (as opposed to eradicate or \n\ncontain). Incomplete knowledge (e.g. predicting impacts) should not delay the process as an early \n\nresponse can be critical in achieving success. To achieve a satisfactory level of control, the \n\noperation should include three levels: 1) initial control, which aims at drastic reduction of the invasive \n\ntarget species, which is usually very costly; 2) follow-up control, aiming to reduce any reinvasion \n\nafter the initial control, which can include seedlings, root suckers and coppice; and 3) maintenance \n\ncontrol to sustain the invader at reduced levels, usually at lower costs and at long term (Campbell, \n\n1993). In the case of plants, knowledge of seed longevity, germination requirements, capacity for \n\nvegetative reproduction and time to first reproduction determines how long the cleared area should \n\nbe monitored to set follow-up (and latter, maintenance) control in place (Grice, 2009). \n\nFor eradication, control and containment, methods applied include mechanical, chemical, and \n\nbiological control, habitat management and integrated management. In the context of this study, the \n\nfocus will be on biological control (see section below). \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nRestoration and Mitigation  \n\nMitigation, in its strict sense, focuses on the affected native species rather than in the invasive \n\nspecies (Wittenberg &amp; Cock, 2001). The interventions of restoration and mitigation range from the \n\nsimple removal of an invasive species to a variety of options that aims to favour natives, or even \n\nmore complex options that involve engineering, native species reintroduction or translocation of a \n\nviable population of the endangered species to a \u201chealthy\u201d, non-invaded ecosystem (Wittenberg &amp; \n\nCock, 2001). Efforts are often complicated by interacting impacts which may create novel functions \n\nwithin the system resulting in unpredictable reactions after control (e.g. secondary invasions, \n\nelevated levels of nitrogen following invasion that will remain after control and preclude natives, \n\nnatives being damaged by control because had became reliant on the invasive species) (Py\u0161ek &amp; \n\nRichardson, 2010). All these issues have to be considered cautiously when planning interventions in \n\norder to avoid, or at least decrease, unwanted effects. \n\n\u201cDo nothing\u201d as an option  \n\nWhen resources are scarce or no effective control measures are available, or when the degradation \n\nis already so profound that \n\nchances of successful \n\nrecovery are very low or even \n\nnonexistent (see Box 1.1), \n\ndoing nothing can be the best \n\noption, at least until some of \n\nthe above scenarios change. \n\nThis approach will avoid \n\nwasting resources that can be \n\nmost effectively used into \n\nother areas or management \n\nactions. \u201cDo nothing\u201d about \n\ninvasive species \n\nmanagement, i.e. choosing to \n\n\u201clive with the problem\u201d, does \n\nnot mean that mitigation actions should not take place.  \n\nSeveral authors advocate that in many ecosystems, but \nparticularly in the ones where human intervention is particularly \nhigh, transformations are such that restoration of invaded \nhabitats aiming to recover the original system in pristine \ncondition is not a realistic or even possible goal (Hobbs et al., \n2006; Richardson et al., 2007; Hobbs, Higgs &amp; Harris, 2009; \nPy\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). In such drastically changed \necosystems the difficulty of removing the invaders may require \na more pragmatic analysis with invaders considered as species \nthat change their ranges and the communities into which they \nare introduced, and may even be needed to guarantee some \necosystems services (Walther et al., 2009). As such, it is almost \ninevitable that new ecosystems will have to be developed as \n\u201cnovel ecosystems\u201d or \u201cemerging ecosystems\u201d. The possible \noutcomes of restoration may be hybrid systems with some of \nthe characteristics of the previous system and other novel \nelements, or novel systems, with different species, interactions \nand functions (Hobbs, Higgs &amp; Harris, 2009) \n\nBox 1.1 \u201cNovel ecosystems\u201d instead \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nMonitoring and evaluation  \n\nFeedback from results of management actions is needed in order to modify, or even abandon, \n\nineffective strategies, to allow other managers/stakeholders to learn from experience and even to \n\nvalidate the management programme. These issues can only be achieved through monitoring and \n\nevaluation of the actions taking place; without them the programme is not complete. Evaluation of \n\nactions should include information about the population of the target invader(s), the condition of the \n\narea under management, and changes in species composition. Establishment of specific targets at \n\nthe beginning of the management programme will help to more-accurately evaluate its success or \n\nfailure afterwards (Wittenberg &amp; Cock, 2001).  \n\nPublic Awareness and Education  \n\nPublic awareness and education are often considered as an important part of prevention but they \n\nshould also be seen as essential to other management options (Wittenberg &amp; Cock, 2001). Activities \n\nshould target technicians, stakeholders and the public in general who are important vectors of \n\nintroduction and spread of invasive species (Ruiz &amp; Carlton, 2003). A well informed public will adopt \n\na more responsible attitude (e.g. selecting native or non-problematic exotic species; being aware of \n\nintroduction pathways and excluding them; adopting measures to avoid being an \u201caccidental vector\u201c \n\nof seeds) and become active (e.g. contributing to early detection programmes; controlling species in \n\nprivate lands) with significant repercussions for species management. Awareness activities should \n\ndeal with issues such as environmental and economic risks involved with IAS, laws and regulations \n\nto prevent introductions of alien species (e.g. reasons for the restrictions; regulatory actions), species \n\nrecognition and easy, practical things to do in order to collaborate with IAS management. Printed \n\nmaterials, video presentations, talks, workshops, interactive games and hands on activities are all \n\npromising approaches (Wittenberg &amp; Cock, 2001; Marchante et al., 2010).  \n\n \n\nBiological control: the most sustainable option? \n\nBiological control (= biocontrol) consists in the use of a species (host-specific) to control another \n\nspecies that has become problematic; the first species is considered to be a natural enemy of the \n\nsecond. According to Py\u0161ek and Richardson (2010) biocontrol \u201chas become and will remain the \n\nfoundation of sustainable control efforts for many invasive species, especially plants, in many \n\nregions\u201d. Several other authors recognized it as the most \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d and cost effective \n\nmanagement practice (Holden, Fowler &amp; Schroeder, 1992; Murphy &amp; Evans, 2009; Wilson et al., \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nsubmitted). Biological control includes several different techniques with classical biological control \n\n(CBC) being the most commonly used against invasive species. CBC is based on the Enemy \n\nRelease Hypothesis (Keane &amp; Crawley, 2002) (see above) and when applied to plants searches for \n\nhost-specific herbivores or pathogens in their native range and afterwards introduces them into the \n\nnew exotic location, where the plant has become problematic (Harley &amp; Forno, 1992). The aim is to \n\ncontrol exotic invasive species in an attempt to \u201crebalance nature\u201d, i.e., remove the competitive \n\nadvantage that the species had acquired when it was initially transferred, and becoming equivalent \n\nto the native species which has their own natural enemies. The aim of CBC is not to eradicate the \n\ninvasive species but instead to reduce it to levels where it no longer causes a significant problem \n\n(Hulme, 2006) though supporting survival of the agent itself and allowing self-replicating populations \n\nto persist without the need for additional efforts of reintroductions.  \n\nBiological control has been used for over a century worldwide, with the first international transfers in \n\nthe 1870s. Initially it was mostly used against plants and insects that caused problems to agriculture \n\ncrops, but more recently it has begun to be used also against invasive species, mainly plants and \n\narthropods (Murphy &amp; Evans, 2009). Nevertheless, the extended use against invasive species was \n\nnot adopted in Europe (Sheppard, Shaw &amp; Sforza, 2006) until early 2010, when the first official \n\nrelease occurred in the UK (Djeddour &amp; Shaw, 2010). Worldwide, nearly 400 agents have been \n\nreleased against over 130 plant species in 70 countries (Julien &amp; Griffiths, 1998). Many introductions \n\nof biocontrol agents resulted in either complete or moderate levels of success. Complete biocontrol \n\nhas been roughly estimated for ca. 30-39% of total cases of invasive plants, while estimations are \n\nthat a higher number of agents have contributed significantly to control de target (Murphy &amp; Evans, \n\n2009). The earliest successful examples included control of the New World prickly pears (Opuntia \n\nspp.) in Australia, in the 1920s, using the moth Cactoblastis cactorum. Nevertheless, failures either \n\ndue to failing to achieve successful control or due to non-target effects are also common. The \n\nrecords of biocontrol agents who have become problematic through direct, and less frequently \n\nindirect, non-target effects (Louda et al., 2003; Louda &amp; Stiling, 2004; Messing &amp; Wright, 2006) came \n\nmainly from the first half of 20th century, when tests performed pre-release were less rigorous and \n\nrisks were not considered in the same way as presently. The problematic cases pushed biological \n\ncontrol to become a highly specialized science, whose protocols address maximizing both safety and \n\nsuccess and thereby minimizing ecological risks (Murphy &amp; Evans, 2009). The practice of selecting \n\nefficacious agents has progressed but is not yet \u201csatisfactory\u201d. Assessing ecological risks prior to \n\nrelease is also not entirely possible (particularly regarding indirect effects) but host specificity \n\nscreening can accurately determine the feeding characteristics of agents. Presently most host \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nspecificity testing is based on a centrifugal phylogenetic method (Briese, 2002). Unfortunately, too \n\nmuch attention has been paid to the few cases where there have been non-target effects (mostly \n\nfrom agents that had proved to be non-specific during risk assessment) and not enough on the many \n\nsuccessful cases (mostly ignored because the target pests are no longer a problem) and this lead to \n\npublic, even within scientific fora, apprehension about CBC of invasive species (Murphy &amp; Evans, \n\n2009). Despite CBC can be considered as potentially dangerous, current practice assures that \n\nbefore a species is cleared for release a full range of tests are performed in order to assure that the \n\nrisk is minimal. In fact, CBC is seen by many as the only safe, practical and economically feasible \n\nmethod to control invasive species that is sustainable in the long term (Murphy &amp; Evans, 2009). \n\nTHE STUDY ORGANISM: ACACIA LONGIFOLIA  \n\nThe genus Acacia sensu lato (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae) is one of the largest plant genus \n\ncomprising over 1380 species, mainly native to Australia and Pacific (993 species), Americas (185 \n\nspecies) and Africa (144 species) (Maslin, 2001) (Figure 1.6). Beyond their native range, acacias \n\nhave been extensively introduced all around the world and large stands are nowadays very frequent, \n\nboth under cultivation and as invasives. Being so numerous and widely used and problematic as \n\ninvaders, publications about the genus are plentiful (e.g. Jones, Roux &amp; Warren (1963); Milton &amp; Moll \n\n(1982); Holmes &amp; Cowling (1997); French &amp; Major (2001); Hoffmann et al.

(2009); Hellmann et al. (2010); Smith (2010)). Particular interest in \n\nthe Australian acacias prompted an international workshop, \u201cHuman mediated introductions of \n\nAustralian Acacia species: a global experiment in biogeography\u201d whose results will be published in a \n\nspecial issue of the journal Diversity and Distributions in 2011. \n\nAcacia sensu lato is now known to be a polyphyletic group (Murphy, 2008) (subgenus Acacia is not \n\nclosely related to subgenera Phyllodineae and Aculeiferum) and as such the maintenance of the \n\ngenus Acacia as it was formerly known has been subject to much recent discussion and may be split \n\nin the future. \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n  \n\nFigure 1. 6 Indicative native range of the genus Acacia sensu lato [source: World Wide wattle \nhttp://www.worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/distribution.php#australian]. \n\nIn fact, in the XVII International Botanical Congress (IBC) in Vienna (2005) the retypification was \n\nratified with the acceptance of a new type for Acacia, namely A. penninervis as a replacement of the \n\nAfrican/Asian species, A. nilotica. Implications are that when, and if, the genus Acacia sensu lato is \n\ndivided the name Acacia will apply only to the ca. 1000 species, mostly Australian, now belonging to \n\nthe subgenus Phyllodineae. If so, most of the species from other subgenera will become known as \n\neither Vachellia or Senegalia (Table 1.4). Nevertheless, the changes (including both retypification \n\nand alternatives to new names) are contentious both amongst the international botanical community \n\n(Moore et al., 2010) and the general public (Carruthers &amp; Robin, 2010) and there are chances that \n\nthe IBC 2005 decision may be reversed (Maslin, 2008). \n\nTable 1. 4 Alternatives of generic and subgeneric names for Acacia sensu lato and numbers of accepted \nspecies (source: World Wide Wattle, http://www.worldwidewattle.com/). \n\nPost-IBC names (A. penninervis -\ntype); Acacia sensu lato treated as: Pre-IBC names (A. \n\nnilotica \u2013 type) \n\na single genus multiple genera \n\nNo. of \nspecies \n\nIndicative distribution \n\nSubgenus Acacia Subgenus \u2018nilotica \ngroup\u2019 \n\nVachellia c. 163 Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia \n\nSubgenus Aculeiferum \nSubgenus \nAculeiferum Senegalia 203 Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia \n\nSection Filicinae \nSection Spiciflorae \n\nAcaciella 15 From south-central U.S.A. to \nArgentina \n\n\u2018Acacia coulteri\u2019 group \nSection Filicinae \n\nMariosousa 13 From Arizona to Costa Rica \n\nSubgenus Phyllodineae Subgenus Acacia Acacia 987 Australia (+); Pacific region (to \nHawaii and Taiwan), \nMadagascar and Mascarene  \n\nTotal number of species 1381  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nAcacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. (Sydney golden wattle, also named long-leafed wattle) belongs to \n\nthe (former) Subgenus Phyllodineae. It is a small nitrogen-fixing tree or shrub (Rodr\u00edguez-\n\nEcheverr\u00eda, Cris\u00f3stomo &amp; Freitas, 2007), 1.5\u201310 m tall, native to south-eastern Australia (Paiva, \n\n1999), which is invasive in Portugal, particularly in dune ecosystems (Marchante, 2001; Marchante, \n\nMarchante &amp; Freitas, 2003), and South Africa (Dennill et al., 1999), among other regions (Elorza, \n\nS\u00e1nchez &amp; Vesperinas, 2004; Kutiel, Cohen &amp; Shoshany, 2004). It has linear to elliptic phyllodes, 5\u2013\n\n25 cm long x 10\u201335 mm wide, with 2\u20134 prominent primary veins; the inflorescences form spikes, \n\nsolitary or twinned, 2\u20135 cm long (Figure 1.7); the pods are cylindrical or subcylindrical, 5\u201315 cm long \n\nx 4\u201310 mm wide and can be straight to curved; seeds are elliptic, sometimes irregularly shaped, 4\u20136 \n\nmm long, shiny; funicle folded several times into a thickened lateral skirt-like aril (Maslin, 2001). \n\n  \nFigure 1. 7 Acacia longifolia: a. branch with small flower buds, b. inflorescences forming spikes, c. cylindrical \npods that can be straight to curved, d. seed with funicle folded several times. \n\nSome authors (Whibley, 1980) recognise two subspecies within this taxon (Table 1.5): A. longifolia \n\n(Andrews) Willd. subsp. longifolia and A. longifolia subsp. sophorae (Labill.) Court., while others treat \n\nA. longifolia and A. sophorae as distinct species (Paiva, 1999).  \n\nTable 1. 5 Distinctive morphological characteristics, including illustrations (by K. Thiele), of A. longifolia subsp. \nlongifolia and A. longifolia subsp. sophorae (adapted from World Wide Wattle http://www.worldwidewattle.com \n/speciesgallery/longifolia.php?id=17861). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \nA. longifolia = \nA. longifolia \nsubsp. longifolia \n\n \n \n \nErect or spreading shrub or tree 1-8 m high. Phyllodes \n6-20 cm long, mostly 4-20 mm wide, 2 or 3 or more \nlongitudinal veins more prominent, apex usually acute \nor subacute. Pods straight to curved, sometimes curled \nback or twisted on opening. \n\n \n \n \n \nA. sophorae = \nA. longifolia \nsubsp. sophorae \n\n \n \n \n \nProstrate or decumbent shrub 0.5-3 m high, sometimes \ntaller. Phyllodes 4-11 cm long, 10-30 mm wide, 2-4 \nlongitudinal veins more prominent, apex subacute or \nobtuse. Pods often coiled and twisted on opening. \n\n \n \n\na b c d \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nBoth taxa show some morphological differences that in some situations seem to be ecological \n\nadaptations to the different environments where they occur (A. longifolia subsp. sophorae usually \n\ngrows closer to ocean and subsp. longifolia is typically more inland), which seems to be the case in \n\nPortugal (H. Marchante, unpublished data). Acacia floribunda (Vent.) Willd is also closely related to \n\nA. longifolia and has earlier been considered as another subspecies (Maslin, 2001). \n\n \n\nWHY DUNE ECOSYSTEMS? \n\nCoastal dune ecosystems are considered a vulnerable ecosystem by IUCN and should have the \n\nhighest priority for conservation action, namely when significant biodiversity values are at risk (Shine \n\net al., 2000). They are not only fundamental barriers against the advance of the ocean but also \n\nharbour many plant species exclusive to dune systems, several of them endemic, and form unique \n\nhabitats which confer them high ecological value (Carter, 1995; Honrado et al., 2006). The stability \n\nand natural dynamics of coastal dunes relies on natural plant communities which bind the labile \n\nsands and minimize the effects of erosion (van der Putten &amp; Peters, 1995).  \n\nCoastal ecosystems are considered amongst the ecosystems most seriously threatened by IAS, \n\nincluding in the Mediterranean (Chytr\u00fd et al., 2009; Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010). In many regions of \n\nthe world, e.g., Australia (Mason, French &amp; Russell, 2007), California (Beckstead &amp; Parker, 2003), \n\nNW European countries (Kollmann et al., 2007), Korea (Kim, 2005), Israel (Kutiel, Cohen &amp; \n\nShoshany, 2004), Portugal (Alves et al., 1998; Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003; Rodr\u00edguez-\n\nEcheverr\u00eda, Cris\u00f3stomo &amp; Freitas, 2007; Marchante et al., 2008b, a) and Spain (Sobrino et al., \n\n2002), studies with different perspectives show that invasive plant species modify, or have the \n\npotential to affect, coastal ecosystems in many different ways, including degradation of biodiversity. \n\nMoreover, the invaders frequently belong to life forms previously underrepresented in several \n\nhabitats of dune ecosystems, thereby causing major transformations of the vegetation structure \n\n(Mack, 2003; Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003) and even loss of habitat diversity. \n\nNative coastal sand dunes in Portugal are characterized by communities that extend from the ocean \n\nto the interior ordered into a spatial succession of plant associations (each with its own species \n\nassemblage), that typically replace themselves after disturbance, and conceal remarkable floristic \n\nand phytocoenotic diversity (Neto, 1993; Honrado et al., 2006; Silva, 2006). The dune species are \n\nnaturally adapted to nutrient poor sands, drought, plenty of light at soil level (Smith &amp; Huston, 1989) \n\nand, depending on the distance to the ocean, sand shifting and salinity. Natural coastal dune \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\necosystems of northern Portugal are generally composed, from the ocean to inland (Figure 1.8) of: \n\n(1) a first zone of bare sand, known as the embryonic dunes, occasionally washed by the sea during \n\nstorms and with sporadic small plants; (2) a second zone with shifting sands, composed of elevated \n\ndunes, normally parallel to the shoreline, where perennial herbaceous species dominate, known as \n\nthe primary dune or foredune; (3) a more depressed zone known as interdune, where sands are \n\nstabilized and dominated by shrub and sub-shrubs species comprising a few small trees occurring \n\ninfrequently; in the interdunal areas commonly occur sandy depressions with freshwater wetland \n\ncommunities; (4) another elevation (secondary dune) also dominated by herbaceous species. The \n\nnumber of interdune (depressions) /secondary dune (elevations) sequences that occur in the interior \n\ndunes may be variable and depends, e.g., on the extension of the dune system, wind regimes, \n\ntopography and occurrence of obstacles to movement of sands (Alves et al., 1998). Beyond the \n\ninterior dunes, there is frequently another zone with sands already consolidated allowing, together \n\nwith dune species, the occurrence of other species such as Pinus spp. and Juniperus spp. There is \n\nfrequent overlap and local variation in the zones which frequently makes them difficult to distinguish \n\nin the field.  \n\nFigure 1. 8 Representation of the typical dune system of the coastal ecosystems of northern Portugal with \nsome of the characteristic plant species. All the species represented occur in the study system (S\u00e3o Jacinto \nDunes Nature Reserve, see below).  \n\nAlong the Portuguese coast, pristine dune systems with all the zones populated by their respective \n\ntypical plant communities are becoming increasingly rare due to several factors, namely forestry \n\nplantations, exploitation for agriculture, tourism, sand extraction, construction and invasion by alien \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nspecies (Rei, 1924; Alves et al., 1998; Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003; Silva, 2006; \n\nMarchante et al., 2008b). This last threat, in particular, is explored in the present study. Numerous \n\nnative species in dune ecosystems are being replaced by invasive species which include A. longifolia \n\n(Alves et al., 1998; Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003), Acacia saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. \n\n(Marchante, 2001), Carpobrotus edulis (Campelo, 2000) and Cortaderia selloana (Marchante, \n\nFreitas &amp; Marchante, 2008). \n\nAcacia longifolia, the most prominent and widespread invader in Portuguese dunes, was introduced \n\nover 150 years ago to curb sand erosion. Besides deliberate planting, its abundance and distribution \n\nhas increased greatly following fire events (Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003). One of the \n\nPortuguese coastal dune ecosystems where A. longifolia has become more widespread and \n\nproblematic includes S\u00e3o Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve, with high value for conservation (Decreto \n\nRegulamentar n\u00ba 24/04, de 12 de Julho). \n\n \n\nS\u00e3o Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve  \n\nS\u00e3o Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (SJDNR) is located at the central-northern coast of Portugal (40\u00ba \n\n39\u2019 N, 8\u00ba 44\u2019 W). It was created in 1979 (Decreto-Lei n\u00ba 41/79, de 6 de Mar\u00e7o) and reclassified in \n\n1997 (Decreto Regulamentar n\u00ba 46/97, de 17 de Novembro). Later in 1999 it was proclaimed the \n\nSpecial Protection Area (SPA) \u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d to conserve wild bird species (Decreto-Lei n\u00ba 384-\n\nB/99, de 23 de Setembro), which integrated Natura 2000 Network, and included SJDNR. Finally in \n\n2004 (Decreto Regulamentar n\u00ba 24/04, de 12 de Julho) SJDNR was reclassified again maintaining \n\nthe protection status and extending the limits of the reserve from 660 ha to 960 ha.  \n\nThe climate of SJDNR is Mediterranean with an Atlantic influence. Dominant winds blow from \n\nNorthwest (NW) and North (N), approaching from the Ocean (additional climatic details are given in \n\nchapters 2, 3, 4 and 5). The soils are arenosols according to FAO classification (Rogado et al., \n\n1993).  \n\nPerennial plant communities observed in SJDNR include two communities on mobile dunes (one on \n\nembryonic and other on primary dunes) and several communities on interior dunes (interdune and \n\nsecondary dunes), including chamaephytic communities of perennial acidophilous grasslands and \n\ndwarf shrublands that coexist in a mosaic (Table 1.6) (Silva, 2006).  \n\nSeveral endemic species, including Portuguese, Iberian and European endemism, are present (e.g. \n\nAntirrhinum majus L. subsp. cirrhigerum (Ficalho) Franco, Corema album (L.) D. Don, Iberis \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nprocumbens Lange subsp. procumbens, Juniperus phoenicea L. subsp. phoenicea, Stauracanthus \n\ngenistoides (Brot.) Samp., Tuberaria guttata (L.) Fourr., Ulex europaeus L. subsp. latebracteatus \n\n(Mariz) Rothm. and Vulpia alopecuros (Schousboe) Dumort.) (Figure 1.8) which shows the \n\nimportance of the communities present in SJDNR. Several zones characteristic of a pristine dune \n\nsystem, with their typical communities, are still present in some areas of the SJDNR although their \n\nconservation status is highly variable and hardly ever incorporating the complete sequence (from \n\nembryonic to interior dunes \u201cin a row\u201d) in pristine condition. Nowadays they are very frequently \n\noverwhelmed by exotic invasive species (Figure 1.9).  \n\nTable 1. 6 Typical zones of the dune ecosystems of the northern Portuguese coast, respective perennial plant \ncommunities and the most representative species occurring in SJDNR (base on Alves et al.

In SJDNR, \n\nA. longifolia proliferated after the initial introduction, and several fire events over time triggered its \n\nexponential growth, resulting in the large monospecific stands that are currently common. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 1. 9 Contrast between the native dune communities (images on the left) vs. the invaded areas (images \non the right) in SJDNR. \n\nWhen this work was carried out, A. longifolia constituted a near-monoculture over 150 ha of SJDNR \n\nand occurred at lower densities in association with other species over 200 ha (Guimar\u00e3es, 2004), \n\nextending from the foredune to the zone of consolidated sands. \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nTHESIS OUTLINE AND OBJECTIVES \n\nThis work, through its five main chapters, aims to contribute to fill some gaps in invasion Ecology, \n\nand additionally to contribute with practical management options that will be useful to managers. \n\nThe first aim of this thesis \u2013 chapter 2 - was to evaluate the effect of the invasive Acacia longifolia at \n\nvegetation level, in areas with different invasion durations (stands long-invaded for more than 20 \n\nyears, vs. stands recently invaded occupied after a summer fire in 1995) over a five years period. \n\nThis allowed, simultaneously and in addition, addressing two issues seldom studied: quantification of \n\nimpacts in the long-term and effects of duration of invasion. \n\nThe anticipated key role of the invader seeds in perpetuating the invasion leaded to the second aim - \n\nchapter 3: to increase knowledge about the seed ecology of A. longifolia, namely quantifying the \n\nseed rain, assessing seed viability before and after entering the soil and measuring the accumulated \n\nsoil seed bank. \n\nIdeally, before embarking in expensive management plans of an invasive plant the likelihood that \n\nrestoration efforts will succeed should be assessed (Zavaleta, Hobbs &amp; Mooney, 2001). Therefore, \n\nthe next question that this thesis intended to answer was whether the system still was resilient, i.e., \n\ncapable of autogenic recover after clearing. With this aim, two distinct approaches were considered:  \n\n- first (chapter 4), the soil seed bank was evaluated to test the potential resilience of the system and \n\nto access the validity of seedling emergency method to do it quickly; cleared vs. uncleared plots \n\nwere compared;  \n\n- second (chapter 5), in experimentally cleared plots (considering A. longifolia removal with and \n\nwithout the underlying litter layer) the recovery of vegetation was monitored through time, from 2002 \n\nto 2008 achieving a recovery period longer than most post-clearing studies.  \n\nBoth approaches (chapters 4 and 5) considered clearing of long- and recently invaded stands.  \n\nBecause the methodologies available in Portugal for control of A. longifolia are expensive and do not \n\nproduce satisfactory long-term results, a biocontrol agent successfully used in South Africa for more \n\nthan 20 years was evaluated. The safety of using the Australian gall forming wasp (Trichilogaster \n\nacaciaelongifoliae), that targets seed reduction but also curbs the vegetative growth, was tested to \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nreduce the invasive success of A. longifolia in Portugal (chapter 6); its implications are discussed \n\nand an overlook of the legal procedures needed before release is presented. \n\nGeneral introduction (chapter 1) and discussion (chapter 7) are included aiming to integrate the five \n\nmain chapters (chapters 2-6) and trying to avoid much overlapping with each separate chapter. \n\n \n\nREFERENCES  \n\nAguiar, F., Ferreira, M. &amp; Albuquerque, A.n.

Despite \n\nstudies about impacts of invasive species are becoming very frequent, there is a scarcity of both long \n\nterm studies and studies considering the effects of invasion time on native communities. \n\nDiversity, species richness and cover of contrasting plant communities of a Mediterranean coastal \n\ndune were compared over a five-year period to assess the impacts of an invasive tree, Acacia \n\nlongifolia. Three situations were compared, a recently invaded area, a long-invaded area and an \n\narea that had never been invaded. Plant traits, similarity between areas and species turnover were \n\nalso analyzed because these measures potentially reveal patterns that are not apparent in \n\ncomparisons of the single values derived from measures abovementioned. \n\nResults showed that native species richness was lower in both recently and long-invaded areas than \n\nin uninvaded areas. As invasion time extended, species shared with native areas decreased, \n\nreductions in plant cover, evenness and diversity intensified and species turnover rates declined. \n\nAnalyses of traits showed that: a) in both recently- and long-invaded areas geophytes, \n\nhemicryptophytes and chamaephytes were underrepresented while species of therophytes adapted \n\nto elevated nitrogen levels in the soil were overrepresented; b) in recently invaded areas, species \n\ntypical of dunes were replaced by native and exotic generalists; c) in long-invaded areas terophytes \n\nand wind-dispersed species were underrepresented. The potential for reinvasion by A. longifolia was \n\nhigher in long-invaded areas, while other exotic species were more frequent in recently invaded \n\nareas. \n\nSynthesis. Dunes invaded by A. longifolia become transformed from almost treeless landscapes \n\ninto highly modified woodlands which become more degraded the longer the invasion is left to \n\nprogress. The invasion brings about a diversity of biotic changes in both the structure and function of \n\nthe ecosystem which are yearly dynamic and apparently tend to stabilize after several decades. \n\nAnalyses including only single-figures parameters conceal some of the changes taking place. \n\nKeywords: dispersal syndromes, dominance diversity curves, IAS impacts, invasion Ecology, plant \n\ntraits, Portugal, Raunki\u00e6r life forms, recently- vs. long-invaded areas, Sorensen similarity, turnover \n\nrates  \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nInvasive alien species (IAS) represent one of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide, being \n\nconsidered a major threat to rare and endangered species as well as to the integrity and function of \n\necosystems (Blossey, 1999; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; Richardson et al., 2008; \n\nGaertner et al., 2009). The impacts of IAS are numerous, severe and frequently irreversible, often \n\nintensifying with time (van Wilgen et al., 2008; Lodge et al., 2009). They affect biodiversity, decrease \n\nspecies richness and change community structure, species cover and environmental conditions \n\n(Gaertner et al., 2009; Hejda, Py\u0161ek &amp; Jaros\u00edk, 2009; J\u00e4ger, Kowarik &amp; Tye, 2009; Vil\u00e1 et al., 2010) \n\nwhile altering ecosystem functioning and disrupting ecological networks (Vitousek &amp; Walker, 1989; \n\nD'Antonio &amp; Kark, 2002; Ehrenfeld, 2004; Marchante et al., 2008b; Heleno et al., 2009; Bartomeus, \n\nVil\u00e0 &amp; Steffan, 2010). Economic impacts, e.g. management actions and productivity losses (Lodge et \n\nal., 2009), can be enormous and are usually more easily perceived by stakeholders. In Europe \n\nalone, costs have been estimated as ca. \u20ac10 billion annually; a conservative value as impacts of \n\nmore than 90% of the IAS have not yet been quantified (Hulme et al., 2009). Invasive plants are \n\nfrequently spatially more localized than animals and have more ecological than economic impacts, \n\nmaking it difficult to attribute a financial value to their impacts (Vil\u00e1 et al., 2010). Regardless of their \n\nobvious impacts, sweeping generalizations such as IAS cause species extinction or that they rank \n\n2nd as the most significant worldwide threat to biodiversity, should be avoided or at least rigorously \n\ncontextualized when used (Sax &amp; Gaines, 2008; J\u00e4ger, Kowarik &amp; Tye, 2009). \n\nImpacts of IAS are frequently assessed according to their influence on parameters such as species \n\nrichness, diversity indexes or plant cover (Hejda &amp; Py\u0161ek, 2006; Hejda, Py\u0161ek &amp; Jaros\u00edk, 2009; \n\nJ\u00e4ger, Kowarik &amp; Tye, 2009) which, while useful, reduce changes in species assemblages to single \n\nvalues which over simplify the situation and thereby may obscure real patterns and trends. Species \n\ntraits are characteristics that reveal species adaptations to the environment they occupy (Menezes, \n\nBaird &amp; Soares, 2010) allowing complex clusters of species to be categorised into a relatively small \n\nnumber of groups. Both biological (e.g. life form, dispersal mode) and ecological (e.g. tolerance to \n\nnitrogen level, species biogeographic distribution) traits can be useful indicators of environmental \n\nchange, e.g. invasion by exotic species, because they have the potential to reveal differences \n\namongst species assemblages of distinct communities or alterations occurring in one community \n\nthrough time. This is possible because each species (with its own identity, adaptations and functions) \n\nis assigned a trait. Analyses of these species traits can augment patterns derived from single-value \n\nparameters, with no need for complex analyses of extensive species lists. \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\nCoastal ecosystems are considered of high priority for conservation action by the International Union \n\nfor Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (Shine, Williams &amp; G\u00fcndling, 2000), being important ecological \n\nsystems of native plants which retain the integrity of the coast line by promoting dune formation \n\n(Carter, 1995). Alien plant species have been frequently introduced to coastal dunes to curb sand \n\nerosion (Rei, 1924; Elorza, S\u00e1nchez &amp; Vesperinas, 2004; Hulme et al., 2008). With time, however, \n\nsome of these same species have become a major threat to the ecosystems they were supposed to \n\nprotect and dunes now rank among the most extensively transformed ecosystems due to invasive \n\nspecies (Beckstead &amp; Parker, 2003; Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003; Mason, French &amp; \n\nRussell, 2007; Marchante et al., 2008b). When coupled with increasing threats, such as sea levels \n\nrising, valuable dune ecosystems will probably become even more vulnerable to disruptive \n\ninfluences (Granek et al., 2010).  \n\nPlant communities on Portuguese coastal dunes include a remarkable floristic and phytoceonotic \n\ndiversity (Honrado et al., 2006). Although the floristic assemblage does not include a high number of \n\nendemic species, several habitats (namely plant associations of the interior dunes) are considered \n\nunique (Honrado et al., 2006; Silva, 2006) and a high priority for conservation. The invasion of these \n\nusually-open communities by IAS, including tree species, leads to drastic changes in the landscape \n\n(Alves et al., 1998; Campelo, 2000; Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003). Acacia longifolia \n\n(Andrews) Willd (Fabaceae) is one species which is invasive in several regions of the world \n\n(Henderson, 1998; Weber, 2003), including in Europe where it has proliferated on coastal dunes \n\n(Elorza, S\u00e1nchez &amp; Vesperinas, 2004). Its impacts include declines in plant species richness and \n\ncover, changes in seasonal dynamic of plant communities (Marchante, 2001; Marchante, Marchante \n\n&amp; Freitas, 2003; Hellmann et al., 2010) and alteration of soil chemical and microbiological \n\nparameters with consequent changes to ecosystem functioning (Marchante, 2008; Marchante et al., \n\n2008b, a). \n\nConsidering the impacts measured so far, A. longifolia is a \u201ctransformer\u201d (sensu Richardson et al \n\n(2000) or \u201cecosystem engineer\u201d (see Conser &amp; Connor (2009)). However, as for many other species \n\nand ecosystems, though important, median or long-term analyses of the transformation of plant \n\ncommunities through time are scarce and none seem to consider the influence of invasion duration \n\n(Strayer et al., 2006; Carlsson et al., 2010; Hellmann et al., 2010). Considering that the dune \n\nsystems which are particularly susceptible to invasion (Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003) \n\ninclude many plant species with ephemeral life cycles (Silva, 2006) some of which persist as \n\ndormant seed banks (Marchante, Freitas &amp; Hoffmann, 2010a) studying such systems for long time \n\nperiods can reveal patterns that are easily overlooked when assessments are of short duration. This \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nrealisation provided the impetus for us to set up permanent plots in sand dunes that were either non-\n\ninvaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia. The plots were monitored for 5 years \n\naiming to assess the impact of A. longifolia on the composition of native plant communities and to \n\nmeasure species, traits and habitat changes over time. The reinvasion potential of A. longifolia and \n\ninvasion by other exotic species were also analysed. We investigated the following questions: 1) Do \n\nimpacts of invasion intensify as the invasion gets protracted? 2) Are patterns of impacts dynamic \n\nover a period of five years? 3) Can measurements of multiple parameters reveal impacts not noticed \n\nwhen single-value parameters are measured alone? This study also serves as a baseline \n\nassessment to compare what happens to the invaded plant communities after A. longifolia is \n\nremoved with mechanical clearing, and after the introduction of biocontrol agents, thereby avoiding a \n\ngeneral deficiency in this type of study as recognised by Thomas &amp; Reid (2007). \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nStudy site - The study area was located in the S\u00e3o Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (hereafter \n\nSJDNR) which is located on the central-northern coast of Portugal (40\u00ba 39\u2019 N, 8\u00ba 44\u2019 W). This area \n\nhas been a proclaimed nature reserve since 1979, receiving the status of Special Area of \n\nConservation for the Natura 2000 network in 1999. When this study was initiated, SJDNR covered \n\nca. 660 ha being enlarged subsequently. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the West and by the \n\nRia de Aveiro estuary to the East. The climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence. The mean \n\nannual precipitation is 920 mm and mean monthly temperatures range from 10.2\u00baC in January to \n\n20.2\u00baC in June. Dominant winds blow from Northwest and North, approaching from the Ocean. \n\nHistorically the area supported open vegetation characterized by several plant communities \n\ncomposed of distinct assemblages of species (plant associations), with sporadic small trees and \n\nabundant shrubs, sub-shrubs and herbs (Neto, 1993). Such open communities still persist in non-\n\ninvaded areas, including several endemic plant associations (Honrado et al., 2006; Silva, 2006). \n\nPinus pinaster Aiton (maritime pine) and A. longifolia were introduced into SJDNR early in the 20th \n\ncentury to curb movement of sand. Acacia longifolia has subsequently proliferated, occurring as a \n\nmonoculture in over 150 ha and at lower levels in association with other plant species in over 200 ha \n\n(Guimar\u00e3es, 2004). Besides A. longifolia, the reserve is also invaded to a lesser extent by \n\nCarpobrotus edulis (L.) N.E.Br. (ice plant) and Cortaderia selloana (Schultes) Asch. &amp; Graebner \n\n(pampas grass). \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nThe areas invaded by A. longifolia in SJDNR can be divided into long-invaded and recently invaded \n\nareas. Long-invaded areas (while limited to monospecific stands) have had A. longifolia for several \n\ndecades and are largely restricted to a small area located along the Southern border of SJDNR. The \n\nrecently invaded areas came about during the 1995 summer when A. longifolia proliferated over a \n\nlarge area of the reserve after a natural fire which destroyed about 200 ha of vegetation, including \n\npine plantations and dune vegetation (Silva 1997). Before the fire, the burnt areas had low numbers \n\nof A. longifolia plants, mostly in the understory of maritime pines. \n\nExperimental design - Studies were carried out to compare non-invaded, recently invaded and \n\nlong-invaded areas, all located on stabilized dunes away from the sea. Non-invaded areas were free \n\nof A. longifolia trees, while invaded areas supported almost monospecific, arboreal stands of \n\nA. longifolia overlaying large quantities of leaf litter (Marchante et al., 2008b) and reducing the \n\nintensity of light at soil level (Table 2.1). Open patches within the invaded areas contained remnants \n\nof the native vegetation, with several species in common with the non-invaded areas, indicating that \n\nthe invaded areas had the same floral elements prior to the proliferation of A. longifolia.  \n\nTable 2.1 Light intensity and quantity of litter (mean \u00b1 SE) in experimental plots of long-invaded, recently \ninvaded and non-invaded areas. Light measurements were made monthly from February to October 2006 \nbetween 9 a.m. and 12 a.m. on days without clouds. Values are means of six measurements per plot. Litter \ndata are based on Marchante et al. (2008b). \n\n \n\nIn each type of stand (non-invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded), five permanent plots, each \n\n10 x 10 m, were demarcated. Each plot was located at least 50 m from any of the others. In each \n\nplot, two transects of 2 x 10 m was marked giving a total of 10 transects in each type of area. \n\nTransects were monitored in May/early June 2003, 2006 and 2008, when most annual and biannual \n\nspecies were growing (Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003). The number and identity of plant \n\nspecies, species cover, and number of A. longifolia seedlings was registered in each transect. \n\nData analysis - Seedling abundance and cover of A. longifolia, species richness, total plant cover, \n\nPielou evenness and Shannon diversity (all parameters translated as single figures) were calculated \n\nas the means of ten 20 m2 transects and were analysed by a General Linear Model (GLM) repeated-\n\nmeasures MANOVA, with year of monitoring (2003, 2006 and 2008) as a within subject factor and \n\ninvasion status as between-groups factor. As absence of A. longifolia was a prerequisite to define \n\nnon-invaded areas, analyses of A. longifolia cover and seedling abundance did not include non-\n\ninvaded areas. Data from the three sampling years were compared to detect possible changes in \n\nLong-invaded Recently invaded Non-invaded\n\nlight at soil level (\u00b5mol.m\n-2\n\n.s\n-1\n\n) 170.2 \u00b1 6.3 283.6 \u00b1 9.5 1198.2 \u00b1 28.0\n\nlitter (kg m\n-2\n\n) 2.05 \u00b1 0.24 1.43 \u00b1 0.14  0.55 \u00b1 0.09\n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nimpacts through time. Post-hoc tests were conducted using the Fisher LSD, at P &lt;0.05. Because \n\nthe interaction between factors was significant (except for Evenness) the post-hoc was performed for \n\nthe interaction and the graphs were computed accordingly. Since A. longifolia was the potential \n\ndriver of change in the rest of the plant community, it was excluded from the analysis of species \n\nrichness and total plant cover. Pielou evenness and Shannon diversity calculations (Magurran, 1988) \n\nincluded A. longifolia as these indexes reflect the presence of a dominant species. STATISTICA 6.0 \n\n(StatSoft, Inc., 2001, http://www.statsoft.com) was used for the statistical analysis. \n\nFor plant traits, dominance-diversity curves, also named rank abundance curves, were computed \n\naccording to Kent and Coker (1992), to describe evenness of species distribution and relative \n\nspecies dominance within each type of area. Curves were first computed for the full rank of species \n\n(each sampling year separately) to compare the three areas. The species were then categorized into \n\ntraits (Table 2.2) and additional curves were plotted for each plant trait separately. For traits analysis \n\nthe coverage of each species in the ten 20 m2 transects were pooled to reveal the full spectrum of \n\nspecies in each area and then the mean of three years was computed. The species were ranked \n\nfrom the most to the least abundant for each curve separately.  \n\nTable 2.2 List of biological and ecological plant traits and respective attributes used for the analysis. \n\nTrait  Attribute * Source  \n\nBiological trait: \nRaunki\u00e6r life form \n\nTherophyte, hemicryptophyte, chamaephyte, geophyte, nanopha-\nnerophytes, phanerophytes (include all phanerophytes but the \nnanophanerophytes) \n\n1, 2 \n\nBiological trait: \nDispersal mode # \n\nNo obvious agent; animals; wind 1, 4, 5 \n\nEcological trait: \nBiogeographic \ndistribution  \n\nExotic &amp; invasive, native &amp; generalist (species that occur in several \ndifferent habitats), native &amp; dune specialist (species that are limited \nto dunes), native &amp; dune/generalist (species that occur in dunes and \nother habitats but are limited to sandy soils) \n\n2, 3 \n\nEcological trait: \nTolerance to soil nitrogen \n\nNon-nitrophilous, nitrophilous, sub-nitrophilous and escionitrophilous 2, 6 \n\n1 = Field observations; 2 = Franco (1971, 1984); Franco &amp; Afonso (1994, 1998, 2003); 3 = Marchante, \nFreitas &amp; Marchante (2008); 4 = Fenner &amp; Thompson (2005); 5 = Hodgson et al.

QS detects differences between areas that have similar values of species richness, \n\ndiversity or cover but are composed of different species assemblages. QS was computed with the \n\nformula QS = 2C/(A + B), where A and B are the number of species in samples A and B, \n\nrespectively, and C is the number of species shared by the two samples. The coefficient varies \n\nbetween 0 (different) and 1 (identical) (Magurran, 1988). The species present in the ten 20 m2 \n\ntransects were pooled, for each year separately, providing the total number of species present in the \n\nten transects of each area.  \n\nSpecies turnover rates (TR) were calculated according to Hilli, Kuitunen &amp; Suhonen (2007) to \n\nmeasure changes of species between 2003 and 2008, as follows: TR =0.5 (L+G), where L is the \n\nnumber of species lost and G is the species gained during a defined period of time. TR is 0 (zero) \n\nwhen there is no change in species composition over the interval between samplings and has no \n\nmaximum value when there is change. \n\nRESULTS \n\nPresence of A. longifolia  \n\nThere was a significant interaction between invasion status and year of monitoring (F2,10 = 4.19, \n\nP = 0.048) with A. longifolia cover being ca. 10% higher in long-invaded areas than in recently \n\ninvaded areas (Figure 2.1a). When the number of A. longifolia seedlings was quantified, as a \n\nmeasure of the reinvasion potential, there was also a significant interaction between factors \n\n(F4,20 = 40.67, P &lt;0.0001) showing a significant increase of emerged seedlings in long-invaded \n\nareas, both over time and compared to recently invaded areas. There was a different trend in \n\nrecently invaded areas with seedlings decreasing from 2006 to 2008 (Figure 2.1b). \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n2003 2006 2008 2003 2006 2008\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invaded\n\nA\n. \nlo\n\nn\ng\n\nif\no\n\nli\na\n\n c\no\n\nv\ne\n\nr \n(%\n\n)\n\nb\na\n\n(a)\n\nbb\naa\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n2003 2006 2008 2003 2006 2008\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invadedA\n. \nlo\n\nn\ng\n\nif\no\n\nli\na\n\n s\ne\n\ne\nd\n\nli\nn\n\ng\ns\n m\n\n-2\n\nbc\n\n(b)\n\na\nabab\n\nd\n\nc\n\n  \n\nFigure 2.1 Cover of A. longifolia mature trees (a), and number of A. longifolia seedlings (b) (mean +SE, \nn = 10) in areas long-invaded and recently invaded by A. longifolia, from 2003 to 2008.

Not surprisingly, both of the invaded areas were dominated by a single species, \n\nA. longifolia, while other species that were present in the invaded areas showed only very sparse \n\ncover. From 2003 to 2008, species abundances remained consistent for the most part, the exception \n\nbeing a marked decline in the abundance of several species in recently invaded areas (Appendix \n\n2.2). Overall, species were more evenly distributed in non-invaded areas than in invaded areas, \n\nalthough two species, Cistus salvifolius L. and Cytisus grandiflorus (Brot.) DC., were more abundant \n\nin some non-invaded plots and three other species, Carex arenaria L., Artemisia campestre L. \n\nsubsp. maritima Arcangeli and Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don fil. subsp. picardi (Boiss. &amp; \n\nReuter) Franco were also well represented on other non-invaded plots. \n\nInteraction between invasion status and year of monitoring was statistically significant for both \n\nspecies richness (F4,20 = 5.448, P = 0.004) and plant cover (F4,20 = 15.95, P &lt;0.0001). The average \n\nnumber of plant species per plot under A. longifolia canopies was less than half the number of \n\nspecies in non-invaded areas and it was generally similar in both invaded areas (Figure 2.2a). Plant \n\ncover, other than A. longifolia (Figure 2.2b), was 3 to 6-fold lower in recently- and long-invaded \n\nareas, respectively, than in non-invaded areas. Plant cover increased between 2003 and 2006 in \n\nnon-invaded areas and showed some decline between 2006 and 2008 in recently invaded areas with \n\nno significant variation otherwise. \n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\nLong-\n\ninvaded\n\nRecently-\n\ninvaded\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\nn\no\n\n.o\nf \ns\np\n\ne\nc\nie\n\ns\n\nf\n\nc\nabc ab\n\nd\n\nbc\n\ne\n\na\n\n(a)\n\na\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\nLong-\n\ninvaded\n\nRecently-\n\ninvaded\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\n%\n c\n\no\nv\ne\n\nr\n\na\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n(b)\ndd\n\nb\naa\n\n  \n\nFigure 2.2 Species richness (a) and plant cover (b) (mean +SE, n = 10), in 20 m2 plots, in areas long-invaded, \nrecently invaded and non-invaded by A. longifolia, from 2003 to 2008.

More species that are characteristic of dunes and dune/generalists \n\nwere present, and particularly abundant, in non-invaded areas, while these species comprised only \n\nabout a third of all species in invaded areas. The number of native generalist species was higher in \n\nrecently invaded areas, with two species co-dominating and many sparse species co-occurring. \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.3 Dominance-diversity curves for each attribute of species biogeographic distribution in communities \nof areas non-invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia. The sequence in each trait attribute \n(in abscissa) lists species from most to least abundant and consequently each number in the different \nsequences does not necessarily correspond to the same species. Abundance of each species plotted is an \naverage of observations between 2003 and 2008.  \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nRegarding life forms (Figure 2.4), nanophanerophytes were the most abundant in non-invaded \n\nareas, despite there being only five species, followed by chamaephytes (with more species evenly \n\ndistributed) and geophytes (with one species particularly abundant). Invaded-areas were dominated \n\nby the (micro) phanerophyte A. longifolia, and the few species, very sparse, that were found under \n\nA. longifolia were mainly therophytes. Three life forms, namely chamaephytes, geophytes and \n\nhemicryptophytes, that were well-represented in native dunes were scarce, or even absent, in \n\ninvaded areas. Phanerophytes, other than A. longifolia, that were present in invaded areas were in \n\nvery low abundance. \n\n  \n\nFigure 2. 4 Dominance-diversity curves for each attribute of Raunki\u00e6r life forms in communities of areas non-\ninvaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia (see Figure 2.3 caption for details). \n\nThere was a high number of wind-dispersed species in recently invaded and non-invaded areas \n\n(Figure 2.5), with them being more evenly distributed in the latter areas. These species were \n\napparently more sensitive to invasion age as about half were not found in long-invaded areas. Many \n\nanimal dispersed species and species with no obvious agent of dispersal were excluded by \n\nA. longifolia, with invaded areas having less than half the numbers found in non-invaded areas. \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.5 Dominance-diversity curves for each attribute of dispersal mode in communities of areas non-\ninvaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia (see Figure 2.3 caption for details). \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\nThere were more species that are dependent on nitrogen in recently invaded areas than on native \n\ndunes, with escionitrophilous being more numerous and abundant in both invaded areas \n\n(Figure 2.6). Non-nitrophilous species were most numerous and abundant in non-invaded dunes. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 Dominance-diversity curves for each attribute of nitrophily adaptation, in communities of areas \nnon-invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia (see Figure 2.3 caption for details).  \n\nSimilarity amongst areas \n\nThere was little similarity in species composition of invaded and non-invaded areas, decreasing with \n\ninvasion duration. About 20% (QS 2003 = 0.18; QS 2006 = 0.23; QS 2008 = 0.19) of the species were \n\ncommon to long- and non-invaded areas while ca. 30% species (QS 2003 = 0.35; QS 2006 = 0.31) were \n\nshared between recently- and non-invaded areas, with the exception of 2008 (QS 2008 = 0.14). More \n\nthan 50% of the species were common to both of the invaded areas (QS 2003 = 0.51; QS 2006 = 0.56; \n\nQS 2008 = 0.56). \n\nSpecies turnover rates \n\nTurnover rates (TR) were higher than zero in all areas showing that a shift of species has occurred \n\nover time, being significantly higher in some of the areas (F2,27 = 3.51, P = 0.044). TR was higher in \n\nnon-invaded areas (TR = 2.98 \u00b1 0.66) and recently invaded areas (TR = 2.86 \u00b1 0.39), which were \n\nsimilar to each other (P = 0.86), and higher than in long-invaded areas (TR Long-\n\ninvaded = 1.46 \u00b1 0.16; P = 0.025 and P = 0.037, when compared to non-invaded areas and recently \n\ninvaded areas, respectively). \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nPrevious short-term studies of the impacts of moderate invasions of A. longifolia in Portuguese \n\ndunes showed seasonal reductions in species richness which were particularly striking in spring \n\nwhen ephemeral life forms were most abundant, and a consistent decrease in native plant cover and \n\ndiversity (Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003). The present long-term study corroborates some of \n\nthe earlier findings, but in areas more-densely invaded by A. longifolia. More importantly, the current \n\nstudy showed that impacts both intensify and change patterns as the time of invasion extended. \n\nFurthermore, it showed that some changes take years to become evident and that assessment of \n\nimpacts including only parameters expressed by single-figures can give an incomplete picture of the \n\nchanges that are occurring. \n\nHow do impacts of invasion on plant communities intensify with time? \n\nPlant communities in areas recently invaded by A. longifolia were already substantially different from \n\nthose in non-invaded areas showing that vegetation responds more rapidly to invasion than soil \n\nwhose chemical and microbial composition was particularly altered in long-invaded stands but much \n\nless so in recently invaded areas (Marchante et al., 2008b, a). Changes in plant communities were \n\neven more pronounced under long-invaded stands where the denser canopy prevents further the \n\nlight penetration (Table 2.1) and increasingly reduces bare soil for other species to grow in. The \n\nthicker layer of litter accumulated on the soil surface (Facelli &amp; Pickett, 1991; Marchante et al., \n\n2008b) and the depleted abundance of viable native seeds in long-invaded soils (Marchante, Freitas \n\n&amp; Hoffmann, 2010a) also contributed to intensification of these changes. The cumulative degradation \n\nof plant communities with time was corroborated by the fact that there were fewer shared species \n\nbetween non-invaded and long-invaded areas (ca. 20%), compared with ca. 30% shared between \n\nrecently invaded and non-invaded areas.  \n\nSeveral vegetation traits also changed with invasion time. For example, generalist species were \n\nmore abundant in recently invaded areas than in long-invaded areas. The fire in the SJDNR in 1995 \n\ncreated gaps which suited generalist species, both native (e.g. Crepis capillaris (L.) Wallr., Sonchus \n\nspp., Cardamine hirsute L.) and exotic (Gamochaeta pensylvanica (Willd.) Cabrera and Conyza \n\nspp.), and the invader itself. These species are frequently associated with habitat disturbance and \n\nare uncommon or even absent in native dune communities (Alves et al. 1998; Franco, 1984). They \n\nare thus irrelevant (sometimes even with negative consequences) for the conservation of the system. \n\nTherophytes and wind dispersed species were less abundant in long-invaded areas. This pattern \n\nseems to be associated with: (i) the dense canopy creating a barrier to inflows of seed; and (ii) \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nattrition of seed viability in the deep litter layers over long periods of isolation, affecting especially \n\nspecies that depend solely on seeds to reproduce, such as therophytes. \n\nThis demonstration that the impacts escalate and change with duration of invasion is important in \n\nthat it contributes to a better understanding the invasion process (Strayer et al., 2006) and, \n\nadditionally, it emphasises that there are very real consequences of delaying the start of \n\nmanagement operations against invasive plants. \n\nWhat do median/long-term studies reveal about impacts of invasive plants? \n\nSampling repeatedly over several years enables to recognise which impacts are transient and which \n\nare permanent. In this case, germination of A. longifolia seeds within the thickets and replacement of \n\nspecies, changed over time with the changes being distinct in the different areas; short-term studies \n\nwould have lost these trends. Despite the rapid proliferation of A. longifolia (from 0% to over 60% \n\ncover in less than ten years after the fire), during the five years of this study densities of thickets \n\nwere apparently stable. Recruitment of A. longifolia into the populations was counter-balanced by the \n\ncollapse of some mature trees (possible associated with ageing as it was more frequent in long-\n\ninvaded areas) that created gaps which were quickly colonized by invasive and generalist species. \n\nGermination of A. longifolia seeds is typically stimulated by fire (Pieterse &amp; Cairns, 1986) but it is \n\nalso coupled with disturbance (Marchante, Freitas &amp; Hoffmann, 2010b) as happens in many other \n\nspecies (Grubb, 1988; Bullock, 2000). This study showed that there is a greater threat of reinvasion \n\nin long-invaded areas, even though A. longifolia germination was lower in the gaps created by falling \n\ntrees than in adjacent cleared areas (see chapter 5).  \n\nIn long-invaded areas, parameters such as species richness, cover, evenness and diversity did not \n\nchange much during the five years of the study. In recently invaded areas, these parameters \n\ndecreased, with their values approaching those of long-invaded areas by the end of the study. This \n\npattern indicates that impacts tend to stabilize over time, as corroborated by TR being lower in areas \n\nthat were long-invaded, crossing a threshold at some stage as the invasion progresses.  \n\nDo single-measure parameters conceal information about impacts of invasive \n\nspecies? \n\nComparisons of species richness indicated that ca. 30% and 40% of the species in long and recently \n\n-invaded areas, respectively, persisted through the invasion. Sorensen index showed that only ca. \n\n20% (in long-invaded) and ca. 30% (in recently invaded areas) of the species were shared with non-\n\ninvaded areas, increasing the number of species that had been excluded and demonstrating that \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nnovel species had entered the invaded system. In this case at least, the single measure for species \n\nrichness had not revealed the full extent of the impact of the invasion. \n\nAlthough average species richness per sample plot was similar in long- and recently invaded areas, \n\nthe total number of species was higher in recently invaded areas. This discrepancy can be attributed \n\nto the 1995 fire when propagules of different generalists arrived in the burnt area and emerged \n\nheterogeneously through the area. Species rank abundances revealed that the higher number of \n\nspecies in recently invaded stands comprised numerous species with particularly low abundances \n\nwhich are more likely to become locally extinct, thereby reducing species richness in these areas in a \n\nshort-term, as was already evident in 2008.  \n\nPlant trait analyses showed other patterns in the impact of invasion not noticeable with single \n\nmeasures. The few species growing under A. longifolia were mostly distinct from those on non-\n\ninvaded dunes. Chamaephytes, geophytes and hemicryptophytes were almost absent in the \n\nunderstory of invaded stands, as well as in the seed bank (chapter 4; Marchante, Freitas &amp; \n\nHoffmann, 2010a), reflecting the substantial threat posed by A. longifolia to many species that \n\nbelong to these life forms and which are characteristic of dunes (e.g. Malcolmia littorea (L.) R. Br., \n\nMedicago marina L., Crucianella maritima L., Herniaria ciliolata Melderis subsp. robusta Chaudhri \n\nand Iberis procumbens Lange subsp. procumbens, the last two endemic) and are highly relevant for \n\nconservation of dune communities (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2001). The \n\npresence of the above-mentioned species in non-invaded areas shows that, like other invasive \n\nspecies (J\u00e4ger, Kowarik &amp; Tye, 2009), A. longifolia is unlikely to cause extinction at a landscape \n\nlevel. There is however cause for concern because some endemic species have been eliminated \n\nwithin invaded areas.  \n\nSpecies adapted to soils with high levels of nitrogen and/or disturbance, including exotics (e.g., \n\nG. pensylvanica, Oxalis pes-caprae L., Conyza spp.) and natives (e.g. Sonchus asper (L.) Hill, \n\nFumaria muralis Koch subsp. muralis, Lactuca virosa L.) were more frequent and/or abundant in \n\ninvaded areas than non-nitrofilous species that are characteristic of dunes and thrive in non-invaded \n\ncommunities (e.g., Artemisia campestre L. subsp. maritima, C. maritima, M. littorea). These findings \n\nconfirm that invasive species not only alter the environment through their physical presence, \n\ndecreasing light and space, but induce indirect impacts through altered soil chemistry and microbial \n\nchanges (Ehrenfeld, 2003; Marchante et al., 2008a, b). The increase in soil nitrogen and other \n\nnutrients in SJDNR (Marchante et al., 2008b) may thus be compounding problems for native dune \n\nspecies (Smith &amp; Huston, 1989), and at the same time facilitating A. longifolia and other exotics \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\nwhich in turn may exclude additional dune species (Warren, Topping &amp; James, 2009; E. Marchante, \n\nunpublished data). \n\nFurther consequences of the impacts promoted by A. longifolia invasion \n\nPristine coastal sand dunes in Portugal are characterized by communities that extend from the \n\nocean to the interior ordered into a spatial succession of plant associations (each with its own \n\nspecies assemblage) with remarkable floristic and phytocoenotic diversity (Honrado et al., 2006; \n\nSilva, 2006). These species are naturally adapted to nutrient poor sands and plenty of light at soil \n\nlevel (Smith &amp; Huston, 1989). Before invasion by A. longifolia communities with small growth habits \n\nand a few tree species sporadically present were frequent in SJDNR (Neto, 1993). Most of these \n\nprotected native communities, particularly those from interior dunes, are being increasingly replaced \n\nby arboreal stands dominated by A. longifolia, with increasing environmental degradation (Bartz, \n\nHeink &amp; Kowarik, 2010) and changes of ecosystem functions (Marquard et al., 2009) as litter \n\naccumulates and changes soil carbon and nutrient levels (Marchante et al., 2008b) and shade \n\npredominates at soil level (Table 2.1). Even so, some of the species surviving under A. longifolia are \n\ncharacteristic of native communities indicating that the invaded areas were once similar to non-\n\ninvaded areas and still have some potential to be restored (see chapter 5). As with invasion by other \n\nAcacia species (Smith, 2010), a drastic transformation of community structure is occurring rendering \n\nan unrecognizable landscape, notably in its physiognomy and vertical stratification with loss of \n\nseveral strata. Because many native species do not cope with the abovementioned abiotic changes \n\n(Smith &amp; Huston, 1989), biotic transformations are also evident, namely replacement of species and \n\nalteration of the plant traits as registered (at least partially) in other invaded systems (Holmes &amp; \n\nCowling, 1997; J\u00e4ger, Kowarik &amp; Tye, 2009). As observed by Holmes (1990), animal dispersed \n\nspecies and species without obvious agents of dispersal (some probably also animal dispersed \n\n(Fenner &amp; Thompson, 2005)), are commonly excluded by invading Acacia species, indicating that \n\nthe animal seed dispersers themselves are also being excluded. This supports findings of \n\nCarvalheiro et al. (2010) who showed that alterations to plant communities have even more severe \n\nknock-on effects for higher trophic levels (e.g. herbivores, parasitoids and dispersers interlinked in \n\necological webs). These types of changes are almost-certainly occurring in the invaded dunes of \n\nPortugal but have not yet been investigated. Besides these trophic effects, changes in plant \n\ncommunities due to invasion by A. longifolia have repercussions for ecosystem services such as \n\nsupporting (e.g. alteration of succession patterns and soil and nutrient cycling (Marchante et al., \n\n2008b)), provisioning (e.g. threats to native species, alteration of genetic resources), regulating (e.g. \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\nchanging pollination services and erosion and fire regimes) or even cultural services (e.g. effects on \n\necotourism, changes in perception of landscape) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; Vil\u00e1 et \n\nal., 2010). Although not quantified yet, these repercussions clearly translate into high market-related \n\ncosts which need to be assessed. \n\n This five-year study showed that invasion by A. longifolia in coastal dunes brings about a diversity of \n\nbiotic changes in structure (decrease of species richness, cover and diversity) and function \n\n(alteration of dispersal dynamics, spectra of Raunki\u00e6r life forms and nitrogen adaptations, out-\n\ncompeted dune species) of the ecosystem. Some of the changes occur in short periods being lost in \n\n\u201csnap shot\u201d studies. Additionally, this study showed that impacts at plant communities aggravate, \n\nreinvasion potential increases and similarity to non-invaded communities\u2019 decreases as the invasion \n\nextends, apparently tending to stabilization after several decades. Trait attributes/species \n\nrepresented under A. longifolia stands change along time but that perception can be lost with \n\nanalyses including only single-figures parameters.  \n\nParallel experiments including removal of the invader and the litter beneath it will help to evaluate the \n\nrecovery potential of these invaded communities (see chapter 5). In the future, economic impacts \n\nneed to be assessed to show stakeholders and policy-makers the value of what is being lost. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors thank E.

Invasiveness in plants is frequently \n\nassociated with prolific production of seeds which accumulate in the soil. Knowledge of the extent \n\nand persistence of invasive seed banks helps explain invasion processes and enables management \n\nplanning. A study of Acacia longifolia, an invasive species in Portuguese dune ecosystems, provides \n\nan informative example. \n\nMethods Seed rain and dispersal (seed traps), the persistence of seeds in the soil (burial) and the \n\nextent of seed banks were measured and analysed.  \n\nKey results Seed rain is concentrated under the canopy with ca. 12 000 seeds.m-2 falling annually. \n\nThe number of seeds in the soil declined with time, with only 30% surviving after 75 mo. Losses were \n\nlowest at greater depths. Seeds germinability was low (<12%) but viability was high (>85%) for \n\nsurviving seeds. The seed bank under the canopy was approximately 1500 and 500 seeds.m-2 in \n\nlong- and recently invaded stands, respectively. Some seeds were found up to 7 m from the edge of \n\nstands, indicating that outside agencies facilitate dispersal. \n\nConclusions Acacia longifolia produces large numbers of seeds some of which are lost through \n\ngermination, decay and granivory. The remainder form vast and persistent seed banks which serve \n\nas a source of replenishment and make it difficult to control the invader once it is established. Control \n\ncosts escalate as the duration of an invasion increases, highlighting the urgency of initiating and \n\npersevering with control efforts. \n\nKey words: invasive species managment; seed bank; seed dispersal; seed germinability; seed rain; \n\nseed viability; Sydney golden wattle \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nInvasive plant species constitute a major threat to biodiversity worldwide (Richardson et al., 2008; \n\nGaertner et al., 2009), disrupting the integrity and function of ecosystems (Blossey, 1999) with dire \n\nconsequences for rare and endangered species. Their impacts on human health (Genton et al., \n\n2005) and economies, through management practices and losses in productivity (Lodge et al., 2009), \n\nare numerous and severe and usually escalate and intensify with time (Lodge et al., 2009). Very \n\noften, invasiveness in plants is associated with prolific production of seeds which accumulate in the \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\nsoil and form extensive seed banks (Milton and Hall, 1981; Pieterse and Cairns, 1988; Richardson \n\nand Kluge, 2008). Successful control of alien species ultimately requires a reduction in the extent of \n\nthese seed banks (Pieterse and Cairns, 1988; Richardson and Kluge, 2008) and the effectiveness of \n\ncontrol programmes can be significantly compromised through massive seed germination in cleared \n\nareas (Campbell, 2000). Knowledge of the extent and persistence of seed banks is needed in order \n\nto understand the invasion process of each invasive species and to implement rational management \n\nprogrammes for their control. \n\nTo be successful, seeds have to be in the correct physiological state to germinate at a time and \n\nplace that will allow the new plant to survive to maturity (Murdoch and Ellis, 2000). Seeds of some \n\nspecies germinate immediately after ripening, as long as water is available, while others become \n\ndormant or quiescent and remain viable for extended periods until conditions are suitable for \n\ngermination (Fenner and Thompson, 2005), allowing discontinuous germination in some species \n\n(Murdoch and Ellis, 2000). There is evidence that seed longevity may vary under different \n\nenvironmental conditions, especially soil type and climate (Hill and Kloet, 2005) and that duration of \n\ntime in the soil can extend, diminish or have no effect on the viability of seeds (Ara\u00fajo and Cardoso, \n\n2007). \n\nGerminability of seeds may vary among species, among populations and even among individuals as \n\na consequence of genetic, phenotypic and environmental conditions under which the seeds mature \n\n(Gutterman, 2000). These conditions may include the position of the seed on the parent plant, the \n\nage of the plant, the size of the seeds, the abiotic conditions (e.g., temperature, light, moisture, soil \n\nnutrients) where the plant develops and the position where the seeds fall (under or outside the \n\ncanopy) (Gutterman, 2000). Germination, i.e. emergence from the seed bank, is a response to \n\nenvironmental stimuli (Fenner and Thompson, 2005). Particularly in hard-coated seeds, the absence \n\nof germination is generally due to physical dormancy which in many species is broken by diurnal \n\ntemperature fluctuations or temperature extremes induced by fire (Baskin and Baskin, 1998). \n\nAs in other legumes, most Acacia species have hard-coated seeds (Cavanagh, 1980) with physical \n\ndormancy which facilitates the formation of persistent seed banks. Not surprisingly therefore, several \n\nAcacia species from Australia (Holmes and Cowling, 1997; Dennill et al., 1999; Kutiel et al., 2004a), \n\nand some from Africa (Kriticos et al., 2003; NLWRA, 2008), have become notorious invasive plants \n\nin different regions of the world. One of these, Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. (\u2018Sydney golden \n\nwattle\u2019, also named \u2018long-leaved wattle\u2019), has proliferated in the dune systems of the coast of \n\nPortugal and is now considered a priority problem there (Minist\u00e9rio do Ambiente, 1999; Marchante et \n\nal., 2003; Marchante, 2008). Acacia longifolia is a polycarpic species, annually producing seeds \n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\nthroughout its life (Fenner and Thompson, 2005). The seeds are elliptic, 4\u20136 x 2-2.5 mm in size, \n\nshiny (Maslin, 2001), weight 20-30 mg (Murray et al., 1978); they have a small elaiosome that \n\nattracts ants, which bury and disperse the seeds over modest distances, creating a short \u201c seed \n\nshadow\u201d (Willson and Traveset, 2000). Despite this zoochorous adaptation in seeds of several \n\nAcacia species, the vast majority of seeds accumulate beneath, or very close to, the canopies of the \n\nparent plants (Milton and Hall, 1981; Walters and Milton, 2003). Seed banks of A. longifolia have \n\nbeen described as prolific and persistent in South Africa (Milton and Hall, 1981; Pieterse and Cairns, \n\n1988). Environmental stimulation, namely fire, is generally required to break dormancy in Acacia \n\nspecies (Pieterse and Cairns, 1986) although the activities of microorganism (Trumble, 1937) and \n\ninsects (Holmes and Rebelo, 1988) may also play a role. \n\nCoastal dune ecosystems are considered a vulnerable ecosystem by International Union for \n\nConservation of Nature (IUCN) and should have the highest priority for conservation action, namely \n\nwhen significant biodiversity values are at risk (Shine et al., 2000). In many regions of the world, e.g., \n\nAustralia (Mason et al., 2007), California (Beckstead and Parker, 2003), Denmark and other NW \n\nEuropean countries (Kollmann et al., 2007), Korea (Kim, 2005), Israel (Kutiel et al., 2004b), Portugal \n\n(Alves et al., 1998; Rodr\u00edguez-Echeverr\u00eda et al., 2007; Marchante et al., 2008), Spain (Sobrino et al., \n\n2002), studies with different perspectives show that invasive plant species modify, or have the \n\npotential to affect (Kollmann et al., 2007), coastal ecosystems in many different ways, including \n\ndegradation of biodiversity. Moreover, the invaders frequently belong to life forms previously \n\nunderrepresented in several habitats of dune ecosystems, thereby causing major transformations of \n\nthe vegetation structure (Mack, 2003; Marchante et al., 2003) and even loss of habitat diversity. \n\nAlthough A. longifolia is an aggressive invader in several ecosystems, including dunes, around the \n\nglobe (Henderson, 1995; Weber, 2003; Elorza et al., 2004; Marchante et al., 2008), studies of its \n\nseed bank and the potential threat it constitutes for dune ecosystems after removal of the invader are \n\nscarce. Particularly in Portugal, there have been no studies on the seed banks of invasive species \n\nand on their role in the invasion process in dune (or other) ecosystems. In order to redress this \n\ndeficiency and to compare the situation in Portugal with other parts of the world, and thereby assist \n\nin the management of A. longifolia, we measured: 1) the seed rain and dispersal from the plants; 2) \n\nthe survival and viability of seeds after entering the seed bank; and 3) the extent of the resultant \n\naccumulated soil seed bank. Understanding the longevity of seeds allows estimations to be made of \n\nthe short- and long-term probability of reinvasion in areas that have been cleared of invasive \n\nspecies, while knowledge of patterns of seed rain can provide valuable information about dispersal \n\ncapacity and determine the extent to which non-invaded areas are at risk (Cottrell, 2004). \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nStudy site - Experiments were conducted in S\u00e3o Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve, a coastal sand \n\ndune ecosystem of approx. 660 ha, at the central-northern coast of Portugal (40\u00ba 39\u2019 N, 8\u00ba 44\u2019 W). \n\nThe climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence, with a mean annual precipitation of 920 mm and \n\nmean monthly temperatures ranging from 10.2\u00baC in January to 20.2\u00baC in June; mean maximum \n\ntemperatures are 24.2\u00baC in August and mean minimum temperatures are 6.0\u00baC in January (Weather \n\nStation no.102, Aveiro University 40\u00ba 38\u2019 N, 8\u00ba 40\u2019 W, period 1981-2002). Dominant winds blow from \n\nNorthwest (NW) and North (N), approaching from the Ocean. The soils are arenosols according to \n\nFAO classification (Rogado et al., 1993). Historically the area supported open vegetation \n\ncharacterized by sporadic small trees and more abundant shrubs, sub-shrubs and herbs. Early in the \n\n20th century A. longifolia was deliberately introduced to curb sand erosion and over time it \n\nproliferated and spread from areas where it was first introduced with the increases in density and \n\nextent occurring in pulses triggered by fire events (Silva and Lopez, 1997). When the experiments \n\nwere carried out, A. longifolia constituted a near-monoculture in over 150 ha and occurred at lower \n\ndensities in association with other species in over 200 ha (Guimar\u00e3es, 2004). \n\nThe existing stands can be divided into long-invaded areas, where the plant has been established for \n\nseveral decades, and recently invaded areas, where the plant has proliferated within the past 15 yr. \n\nThe long-invaded areas (limited to stands with monocultures of A. longifolia ) are restricted to a small \n\nportion of the reserve located along the south border where the sands are stable (Figure 3.1). In \n\nlong-invaded areas dense thickets persist for more than 20 yr. Acacia longifolia proliferated in the \n\nrecently invaded areas after a natural fire in the 1995 summer which affected about 200 ha of the \n\nreserve, including pine plantations and dune vegetation (Silva, 1997). Before the fire, burnt areas \n\nhad sporadic A. longifolia plants in low densities, frequently in the understory of Pinus pinaster Aiton. \n\nSince the fire, A. longifolia has invaded large areas that extend from the primary dune to the \n\nstabilized dunes (Marchante, 2001) (Figure 3.1). When the experiments were undertaken, \n\nA. longifolia was the dominant species in both the long-invaded and recently invaded areas selected, \n\nforming continuous closed stands (frequently with a cover about 70%) with native plant species \n\noccurring infrequently in the understory (Marchante et al., 2004). \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\nFigure 3.1 Location of the study area, S\u00e3o Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve, in central-northern Portugal, \nshowing areas where experiments of dispersal and soil seed bank took place. Numbers indicate places where \ntransects were demarcated, in recently invaded areas (1, leeward transects and 2, windward transects) and \nlong-invaded areas (3, windward transects and 4, leeward transects). Arrows indicate the orientation of \ntransects in each area. B, area burnt in 2005, and largely invaded after that (recently invaded areas). \n\n \n\nExperiment 1. Seed production and dispersal - Other studies, and personal observations, \n\nshowed that Acacia seeds/ seedlings are frequently detected in close proximity to the stands of \n\nparent plants so the experimental design was set up accordingly. To determine the possible \n\ninfluence of wind on dispersal, two sets of trap transects were set out so that each was aligned with \n\ndirection of the prevailing winds and at a right angle to the edge of a recently invaded stand of \n\nA. longifolia. Six of the transects were placed on the leeward side of the thicket, which happened to \n\nbe on the stabilized dune, and six were placed on the windward side of the thicket, which happened \n\nto be on the primary dune (Figure 3.1 \u2013 no. 1 and 2, respectively). In the primary dune A. longifolia \n\nplants were small (about 1.5 m tall) and prostrate due to exposure to strong winds and salt spray \n\nfrom the sea. The plants were much taller (more than 5 m) on the stabilized dunes. Another set of six \n\ntransects was established in the stabilized dunes at right angles to the edges of a long-invaded \n\nthicket to compare seed fall there with that in the recently invaded area (Figure 3.1 \u2013 no. 1 and 4, \n\nrespectively). The long-invaded and recently invaded stands of A. longifolia were about 2.5 km apart. \n\nSeed traps were set out at the end of May 2004, before seeds started to fall, to quantify seed rain \n\nand evaluate dispersal mediated by wind and/or gravity. As the source was a continuous stand, a \n\nregular distribution of traps was used (Bullock et al., 2006). The traps were placed at intervals along \n\npermanent transects, 12 lying outside the stand (points designated \u201c+\u201d) and 5 inside the stands \n\n(designated \u201c\u2013\u201c) with the point under the tip of the extreme pod-bearing branch set as point zero \n\n(Figure 3.2a). From -2 m to +2 m, seed traps were spaced 0.5 m apart; from +2 m to +10 m and from \n\n-2 m to -3 m the traps were a meter apart. Seed traps (Figure 3.2b) were made from the top portion \n\nof laterally bisected 5 l plastic bottles that were inverted to make a funnel with a 0.0154 m2 opening. \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\nA fibreglass bag was tied around the neck of the funnel to form a closed container in which the falling \n\nseeds were trapped. Each funnel was positioned in the field by being attached, with flexible wires, to \n\na 10 cm high PVC pipe which was partially sunk into the sand, after Cottrell (2004). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 Experimental set up of experiment 1. (A) Schematic representation of transects established to \nmeasure seed rain and dispersal, with 10 m lying outside the stand (0 to +10 m) and 3 m inside the stand (0 \nto -3 m); the point at the extremity of pod-bearing branches was set as point zero; 1 m intervals were used, \nbut from \u2013 2 m to + 2 m additional traps were placed at 0.5 m (o). (B) The seed trap, designed to catch \nA. longifolia seeds. Traps were partially sunk into the sand to avoid drift into the trap of seeds lying on the \nsurface; fibreglass allowed free drainage. \n\nSeeds were collected from the traps at fortnightly intervals after seed rain commenced in June 2004 \n\nand continued until seed fall stopped (end of August 2004). The seeds were counted, and then \n\nchecked for germinability and viability (see methods below). \n\nExperiment 2. Survival of seeds in soil seed bank \u2013 Using a protocol adapted from Holmes \n\nand Moll (1990), ripe seeds were collected during July 2002 from dehiscent pods of A. longifolia \n\ntrees for burial at different depths within cylinders made of fibre glass. The cylinders were filled with \n\nsoil from the study site which had been freshly sieved (2 X 2 mm) to remove any extraneous seeds \n\nof A. longifolia. While being filled, each cylinder had one hundred seeds of A. longifolia sown at one \n\nof three depths, 1-2 cm, 4-5 cm or 8-9 cm from the surface. Once filled with soil, a plastic net lid (2 x \n\n3 mm) was attached to seal the open end of the cylinder. To protect the cylinders from disturbance \n\nby burrowing animals, each was enclosed in a plastic net sleeve (10 cm deep x 7.5 cm diameter) \n\nwhich was sealed at both ends. The mesh of the net (2 x 3 mm) was large enough to allow seedlings \n\nto emerge. Each cylinder was labelled with a plastic tag indicating the position of the seeds within. \n\nThe cylinders were buried with their tops leveled with the soil surface.  \n\nThe cylinders were placed in position, after the peak of seed fall, in open spaces among the native \n\ndune vegetation, where there were no A. longifolia trees, in order to avoid additional deposition of \n\nseeds in the top of the cylinders. A completely randomised block design was used to position groups \n\nof cylinders in five different locations each marked with a wooden stake in the NE-corner. A map of \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\nthe positions of the cylinders was drawn to facilitate recollection. In all, 96 cylinders were buried (6 \n\ncollecting dates x 5 replicates x 3 depths + 6 controls with no seeds, to confirm that seeds were not \n\nentering the cylinders after placement). \n\nCylinders were collected after 4, 10, 18, 31, 55 and 75 mo. Any seedlings observed emerging from \n\nthe bags at collecting times were recorded and removed. On each collection date, 15 bags with \n\nseeds, as well as one of the control bags, were lifted and transferred to the laboratory where the \n\ncontents were sorted with a sieve to obtain the remaining seeds which were counted. Surviving \n\nseeds were tested for germinability and viability (see methods below). \n\nIn order to analyze the data, seeds in each sample were considered as 1) emergent (germinated in \n\nthe field); 2) germinable (germinated in the laboratory without stimuli); 3) dormant (germinated after \n\nstimulation); 4) non-viable (rotted or did not germinate for other reasons); or 5) missing. Seeds \n\ndefined as \u201crecovered\u201d included viable and non-viable with seeds defined as \u201cviable\u201d including \n\ngerminable and dormant. \n\nExperiment 3. Dimension of soil seed bank -- Areas adjacent to the dispersal experiment (1) \n\nwere selected and monitored. The long-invaded areas were located on stabilized dunes while the \n\nrecently invaded areas included both primary dune (along the windward edge of the thicket) and \n\nstabilized dune (along the leeward edge) (Figure 3.1). \n\nTransects were laid at a right angle to the edge of thickets on both the windward and leeward sides. \n\nThe transects (n = 4 for each situation) were 10 m long (Figure 3.3). The point under the tip of the \n\nmost extreme pod-bearing branch was set as point zero so that 7 m of transect extended away from \n\nthe stand (points designated \u201c+\u201d) and 3 m extended into the stand (designated \u201c-\u201c).  \n\nFigure 3.3 Experimental set up of experiment 3. (A) Schematic representation of transects established to \nmeasure the seed bank, with 7 m lying outside the stand (0 to +7 m) and 3 m inside the stand (0 to -3 m); the \npoint at the extremity of pod-bearing branches was set as point zero. (B) Coring device used to extract soil \nsamples; four samples were collected in each point. \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\nBefore seed rain commenced (7 to 14 April 2004) soil samples were collected along the transects to \n\nquantify the accumulated seed bank of A. longifolia. At meter intervals, four soil cores (7.5 cm \n\ndiameter X 10 cm deep; area 44 cm2) were collected and sieved (2 mm mesh) to extract and count \n\nA. longifolia seeds. All of the seeds were retained and screened for germinability and viability (see \n\nmethods below). \n\nGerminability and viability determination - To test germinability seeds were placed in 90 mm \n\nsterilized, glass Petri dishes containing filter paper moistened with benomyl solution (0.022% active \n\ningredient benlat), to avoid fungal development, and retained in a controlled environment at \n\n25 (\u00b1 2)\u00baC. Germinated seeds (those with at least 2 mm radicle) and rotten seeds were counted \n\nevery two days and removed. After 30 days the remaining seeds were considered to be dormant and \n\nwere cut at the micropylar end and maintained until all seeds had germinated or rotted to determine \n\ntotal viability. Seeds that germinated after cutting were considered dormant and were added to the \n\nseeds that germinated before cutting to derive the total number of viable seeds. \n\nStatistical analyses \u2013 The counts of seeds resulting from the seed rain (experiment 1), and \n\naccumulated in the seed bank (experiment 3), were converted into number of seeds.m-2 before \n\nanalysis. Seed rain (experiment 1) was first compared between recently invaded transects running in \n\nopposite directions (one factor), with distance to the stand margin (another factor), using a General \n\nLinear Model (GLM), with a between-subject design Factorial ANOVA. The samples from the \n\nleeward transects were compared with another Factorial ANOVA, considering stand age and \n\ndistance to the stand margin as factors. The quantity of seeds accumulated in the soil seed bank \n\n(experiment 3) was compared with a Three-Way Factorial ANOVA with age of invasion, wind \n\ndirection, and distance to the stand margin as factors. In experiment 1 and 3 (separately) all seeds \n\noriginating from samples collected at each distance were pooled together in each group (long- and \n\nrecently invaded; leeward and windward) and germinability and viability calculated and then \n\ncompared with One-Way ANOVA.  \n\nIn the burial experiment (2), seeds recovered were compared with a GLM, with a between-subject \n\ndesign Factorial ANOVA (depth and duration of burial as factors). The values of germinable and \n\nviable seeds were then analysed as percentages of the recovered seeds using a Generalized Linear \n\nModel (GLZ), with the number of recovered seeds as an offset term in order to accommodate sample \n\nsize. \n\nWhen the interactions between factors were significant, means of the interactions were plotted; when \n\nthe interactions were not significant the means were plotted for each factor separately. \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\nData were transformed when necessary to meet the ANOVA assumptions: seeds in the seed bank, \n\n(experiment 3) were log transformed ( ( )2log +x ); and seeds dispersed (experiment 1) were square \n\nroot transformed ( 5.0+x ). Mean differences were separated with Tukey test at 5% level of \n\nsignificance. The analyses were performed using STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc. 2001, \n\nwww.statsoft.com). \n\nRESULTS \n\nSeed production and dispersal -- Collection of falling seeds showed that there was a significant \n\ninteraction (F7, 80 = 5.06, P &lt;0.001) between wind direction and distance to the stand margin. After \n\nbeing released from the pods, the majority of the seeds fell under the trees (-3 m to 0 m), reaching \n\naverage values of ca. 12 000 seeds.m-2 in the leeward transects and less than 2000 seeds.m-2 in the \n\nwindward transects (Figure 3.4). A few seeds fell beyond the margin of the stand, being dispersed up \n\nto 1 m in both leeward and windward transects. There was little difference in the quantity and pattern \n\nof seed rain along the leeward edge of long- and recently invaded thickets (F1, 100 = 3.13, P = 0.080) \n\n(Figure 3.5). Only a small proportion of the seeds fell beyond the immediate edge of the canopy, and \n\nno seeds were found more than 2 m from the canopy.  \n\n \n\n0\n\n4000\n\n8000\n\n12000\n\n16000\n\n20000\n\n-3\nm\n\n-2\nm\n\n-1\n,5\n\nm\n\n-1\nm\n\n-0\n,5\n\nm\n\n0\nm\n\n+\n0\n.5\n\nm\n\n+\n1\nm\n\n+\n1\n.5\n\nm\n+\n2\nm\n\n+\n3\nm\n\n+\n4\nm\n\n+\n5\nm\n\n+\n6\nm\n\n+\n7\nm\n\n+\n8\nm\n\n+\n9\nm\n\n+\n1\n0\nm\n\n-3\nm\n\n-2\nm\n\n-1\n,5\n\nm\n\n-1\nm\n\n-0\n,5\n\nm\n\n0\nm\n\n+\n0\n.5\n\nm\n\n+\n1\nm\n\n+\n1\n.5\n\nm\n+\n2\nm\n\n+\n3\nm\n\n+\n4\nm\n\n+\n5\nm\n\n+\n6\nm\n\n+\n7\nm\n\n+\n8\nm\n\n+\n9\nm\n\n+\n1\n0\nm\n\nLeew ard Windw ard\n\nn\no\n.o\n\nf \ns\n\ne\ne\nd\ns\n\n m\n-2\n\nc\n\nab\n\nb ab\n\na\n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Comparison of A. longifolia seed rain and subsequent wind dispersal occurring along the leeward \nand windward edges of recently invaded thickets.

The percentage of A. longifolia seeds recovered decreased with duration of \n\nburial (Figure 3.7a). The decline in the number of seeds recovered was significant after 18 mo and \n\nagain after 55 mo of burial. After 75 mo of burial less than 30% of seeds were recovered. Seeds \n\nburied at 8-9 cm showed significantly lower losses than at more superficial depths (Figure 3.7b). In \n\nthe field, seedlings were seldom seen and emergent seeds were only observed when collections \n\nwere made at 4 mo, in very low numbers (at the most, 4 seedlings were observed per cylinder) and \n\nonly from the 1-2 cm and 4-5 cm depths.

Bars with the same letters are not significantly different. \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThe levels of seed production that were measured revealed that A. longifolia is highly prolific in this \n\nexotic location and that, despite major losses of seeds (both before and after entering the seed \n\nbank), the resulting seed banks are substantial. This accumulation of seeds create problems for \n\nmanagement programmes because they germinate en masse following removal of the overstory and \n\nthe cleared areas rapidly become replenished thereby increasing control costs and impeding the \n\nrecovery of ecosystems towards a more natural state. \n\nSeed production and dispersal - Seeds of A. longifolia fell mainly under the canopy, with very \n\nfew being detected beyond 1 m, regardless of transect direction, a pattern which is common for \n\nmany species, including other Acacia (Walters and Milton, 2003), that are not typically wind \n\ndispersed (Bullock and Clarke, 2000). Gravity, and not the wind, seems to be the agent operating in \n\nthe movement of the great majority of seeds, although some seeds were found in the soil up to 7 m \n\nbeyond the edge of the windward side of the thickets. Seeds of A. longifolia are known to be \n\ndispersed by ants, which are attracted to the elaiosome (Willson and Traveset, 2000), and have \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n\nbeen observed carrying seeds in the Portuguese dunes. Other outlying seeds could be the result of \n\nperiodic strong winds blowing in the opposite direction to the dominant winds (Bullock and Clarke, \n\n2000) or may have been moved by other animals, such as rodents (Holmes, 1990), whose activity \n\nwas not incorporated into the sampling process (Cottrell, 2004), or birds. Acacia longifolia seedlings \n\nhave been reported under nests of collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) in the vicinities of SJDNR \n\n(R. Vaz, SJDNR, personal observation), supporting this last hypothesis. Occasional seeds have \n\nbeen moved considerable distances because isolated individuals of A. longifolia occur in locations \n\nconsiderably distant (i.e. 100s of meters) from the main thickets (H. Marchante, personal \n\nobservation). \n\nTrees on the leeward side of the thickets (wind NW-SE), were located in a landward location, on \n\nstabilized dunes, protected from strong winds and salt spray. They were more upright and produced \n\nmore seeds than windswept trees making this aspect the predominant direction of invasion. Trees in \n\nboth long and recently invaded areas produced similar quantities of seeds indicating that, as in other \n\nspecies (Fenner and Thompson, 2005), the quantity of seeds produced is not significantly influenced \n\nby the age of the plant. Up to 16 000 (average 12 000) seeds.m-2 fall under the trees on the leeward \n\nside of the thicket in a single season. Studies with the same species in South Africa (Milton and Hall, \n\n1981) measured lower numbers of seeds (approximately 3000 seeds.m-2) but this discrepancy may \n\nhave occurred because there are substantial annual fluctuations in levels of seed production \n\n(Shibata et al., 2002), or due to inadvertent seed loss from the traps. The lower number of seed in \n\nSouth Africa may also be due to the type of trap used, since seed predation and/or removal of seeds \n\nby wind are probably higher in mesh traps than in funnel traps used in our study (Kollmann and \n\nGoetze, 1998).  \n\nSurvival of seeds in soil seed bank \u2013 Our results show that once buried only 20-40% of \n\nA. longifolia seeds persisted in the seed bank after 31 mo, with little change after 75 mo. Studies with \n\nAcacia saligna and Acacia cyclops showed that, after 30 mo of burial at depths between 1 and \n\n10 cm, 49-79% of A. saligna seeds persisted in the seed bank while less than 5% of A. cyclops did \n\nso (Holmes and Moll, 1990). Acacia longifolia shows a pattern more similar to that of A. saligna. \n\nHolmes and Moll (1990) reported that survival declined more rapidly with deeper burial while we \n\nobserved the opposite in accordance with other studies (Zorner et al., 1984; Lonsdale et al., 1988). If \n\nshallow seeds disappear more rapidly, it is expected that seeds will persist for longer in areas with \n\ndeep sandy soils because more seeds will reach greater depths. These findings should be \n\nconsidered when planning management of such areas. \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n\nSeveral factors contribute to seed loss. Germination naturally contributes to seed bank declines even \n\nthough Fenner and Thompson (2005) note that the majority of seeds fail to emerge as seedlings. In \n\nthis study, the few A. longifolia seedlings that were detected emerging in the field were from seeds at \n\ndepths above 4-5 cm. Other species have been shown to emerge from greater depths (Kent et al., \n\n2001), including A. saligna and A. cyclops whose seedlings reach the soil surface from depths of \n\n15 cm (Holmes and Moll, 1990). For both these species, seedling emergence in the field was \n\ngenerally much higher than for A. longifolia and germination continued for at least 30 mo after burial \n\n(Holmes and Moll, 1990). In the experiments reported here, some A. longifolia seedlings may have \n\nbeen overlooked, having appeared and died in the period between sample collections. Other studies \n\nwith A. longifolia in the same dune system showed that numerous seeds germinate in the field (from \n\nunknown depths), mainly, as happens with many plant species (Grubb, 1988), after disturbance \n\nassociated with the removal of the parent plants, with most dying soon after emergence (Marchante \n\net al., 2004).  \n\nAs buried samples were not disturbed, and vestiges of seedlings were not detected on the soil \n\nsurface, germination does not seem to be the main reason for disappearance of seeds. \n\nUnsuccessful germination at depths too deep to emerge has also been implicated as a major reason \n\nfor seed losses from seed banks (Lunt, 1995). In this study, some signs of germination were \n\napparent as vestiges of radicles or seed coats in the soil samples recovered but disintegration and \n\nfragmentation made it impossible to extrapolate the original numbers of intact seeds involved, a \n\ndifficulty noted by other authors (Bekker et al., 1998). Nevertheless, mortality through unsuccessful \n\ngermination at excess depths does not seem to be the main cause of seed loss, as most seeds \n\ndisappeared at shallower depths. \n\nDecay through the action of microrganisms must also have played a prominent role in determining \n\nnumbers of surviving seeds, as has been implicated with other Acacia species (Holmes, 1989) and \n\nlegume species in general (Leishman et al., 2000). Death due to natural ageing does not seem a \n\nprobable cause of decline because the seeds were buried for only 75 mo and Acacia species are \n\nknown to have higher longevities in the soil (Cavanagh, 1980; Daws et al., 2007). \n\nLow germinability in batches of seeds stored in the soil has been shown for A. saligna and A. cyclops \n\n(Holmes and Moll, 1990). The higher germination rate of A. longifolia seeds collected after 10 mo of \n\nburial could be due to the seeds being collected in spring, when temperatures were increasing and \n\nthere was still sufficient rainfall to keep conditions in the soil moist and therefore favourable for \n\nbreaking dormancy. Dormancy of seeds is known to break during periods of increasing ambient \n\ntemperatures (Holmes and Moll, 1990), especially, at least in legumes, if there is simultaneous \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\nabsorption of water through the hilum of the seeds (Degreef et al., 2002). Most of the other collection \n\ntimes fell in winter, when temperatures were lower and the seeds had not been stimulated to break \n\ndormancy before collection. \n\nThe resulting soil seed bank \u2013 Acacia longifolia plants in long- and recently invaded areas \n\nproduced similar amounts of seeds (average 12 000.m-2, under the canopy) each season but there \n\nwere substantially lower numbers of seeds in the soil seed banks, with more in long-invaded areas \n\nthan in recently invaded areas (approximately 1500.m-2 and 500.m-2, respectively). This differs from \n\nthe situation in South Africa where there were more seeds in the seed bank (7646 seeds.m-2) than \n\nthe numbers produced each season (ca. 3000 seeds.m-2) (Milton and Hall, 1981). A portion of the \n\ndiscrepancy that lead to the higher densities of A. longifolia seeds in South African soils is \n\nattributable to the value 7646 being an average of two means, 2110 seeds.m-2 and 13182 seeds.m-2, \n\nwhich were collected 6 mo after and immediately after seed rain, respectively (S. Milton, University of \n\nStellenbosch, personal communication). The lower of these values is still higher than the values \n\nrecorded during our study and suggests a substantial and steady loss of seeds in the months \n\nfollowing seed rain, as our samples were collected just before seed rain commenced. Indeed, as \n\nseeds accumulate with time the seed bank would be expected to numerically exceed its source of \n\nreplenishment, as happened in South Africa. The unexpected deficit in the seed bank in Portugal \n\nmay be due to conditions in the dune ecosystem that favour the decay of seeds or climatic conditions \n\nthat induced higher levels of germination.  \n\nEvents that happen before the seeds enter the seed bank (germination, dispersal, granivory) and \n\nwithin the soil seed bank (decay, ageing, germination, granivory) account for seed disappearing. The \n\nprobability of some of these events happening within the seed bank in Portugal have been discussed \n\nabove. Granivory, which has been shown to be a cause of seed loss elsewhere (Marone et al., \n\n2000), would not account for the loss of seeds in burial trials because the samples were protected \n\nwith plastic net sleeves. However, granivory could explain a significant proportion of seeds that were \n\nlost, both before entering and within the seed bank. Granivores, namely rodents, have already been \n\nidentified as a major consumer of seeds of A. cyclops, A. saligna (Holmes, 1990) and A. longifolia \n\n(Pieterse and Cairns, 1988) in South Africa even though granivory declines as dense thickets of the \n\nweed form and the canopy closes (Holmes, 1990). Fieldmice (Apodemus sylvaticus) were \n\nsporadically observed during trials (H. Marchante, personal observation) and are a potential seed \n\npredator of A. longifolia seeds. Other, as yet unidentified, invertebrates are known to feed on the \n\nseeds of A. longifolia (E. Marchante, University of Coimbra, unpublished data). \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n\nThe more numerous soil seed bank under long-invaded stands can be explained by the greater \n\nnumber of seed rain events from trees that had been in the area for a longer period than the trees in \n\nthe recently invaded area. Studies with A. saligna have similarly shown that in some areas seed \n\ndensity is much higher in long-invaded sites compared to recently invaded sites, though this is not \n\nalways the case (Holmes, 2002).  \n\nSeeds of A. longifolia fell, and subsequently accumulated, predominantly under the canopy of the \n\nparent trees. A few scattered seeds were additionally found in the soil beyond the margins of the \n\nthickets even though dispersal trials failed to detect seeds in the tail of the dispersal curve, as is \n\noften the case (Portnoy, 1993). In order to account for this, sampling could have been intensified with \n\ndistance (Bullock et al., 2006). The outlying seeds could be the result of the action of several \n\ndispersal agents (see discussion above). \n\nMost of the seeds gathered during the different parts of this study did not germinate without a \n\nstimulus, displaying low levels of germinability, but had consistently high levels of viability (> 85%), \n\nas previously recorded by Milton and Hall (1981). A large portion of fresh Acacia seeds are \n\nimpermeable to water and are therefore unlikely to germinate soon after ripening (Rolston, 1978). \n\nGerminability levels of fresh seeds recorded in this study were higher (approximately 30%) than the \n\n2% recorded for fresh seeds of A. cyclops and for several other Acacia seeds extracted from soil, \n\nnamely A. longifolia, where germinability never exceeded 9% (Milton and Hall, 1981). The age of the \n\nparent plant had no apparent effect on germinability of fresh seeds even though germinability is \n\nknown to decline with age of the parent in some plant species (Gutterman, 2000). Seeds collected \n\nfrom long-invaded areas had much lower germinability (&lt;0.05%) than seeds collected from recently \n\ninvaded areas (> 50%). This indicates that over time dormant seeds accumulate in the soil so that \n\nolder seed banks have a greater proportion of seeds that are unable to germinate without being \n\nstimulated, i.e. usually through disturbance. While the seed banks of long-invaded areas contain \n\nhigher numbers of seeds than more-recently invaded areas, they constitute a smaller threat of \n\nreplenishing the original stands of the weed through germination if disturbance of the soil can be \n\navoided during removal of the overstory. However, zero disturbance is almost impossible to achieve \n\ngiven the nature of control operations and the fact that removal of the overstory in itself is likely to \n\nprovide stimuli that will break dormancy. \n\nHilhorst and Karssen (2000) highlight the importance that physical and chemical environments have \n\non the germination of seeds. There are several differences in the biotic and abiotic conditions of \n\nareas with native vegetation (where seeds were experimentally buried in experiment 2) and areas \n\ninvaded by A. longifolia (where seeds are naturally buried in the seed bank, experiment 3). Light at \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\nsoil level and soil temperature are higher in non-invaded areas, while moisture and accumulated litter \n\nare higher in long-invaded areas with recently invaded areas always having intermediate values \n\n(E. Marchante, unpublished data). Nutrient contents (C, N, Ca2+, Na+, K+ and Mg2+) and microbial \n\nactivity in the soil are generally higher in invaded than in non-invaded areas (Marchante et al., 2008). \n\nAfter entering the seed bank, seeds remain dormant until the testa becomes weathered and water-\n\npermeable (Rolston, 1978). Different factors, such as N content or microbial activity, contribute to \n\nthis process. Another cause of differential level of germinability has been noted in other Acacia \n\nspecies (Holmes and Moll, 1990) in that the hardness of the seed coat in each cohort of seeds is \n\ndetermined by the conditions under which the seeds mature. \n\nCONCLUSIONS  \n\nIn spite of the substantial and continual attrition in seed numbers during and following seed fall and \n\nin the soil seed bank, there is a substantial reservoir of viable seeds under and around A. longifolia \n\nthickets. These banks are the source of reinvasion after any clearing operations. Seeds in the soil \n\nremain viable for at least six years so the pool persists even if control operations disrupt recruitment \n\nof new seeds. Our findings show that managers have to be prepared to take immediate action after \n\ndisturbances (e.g., fire or clearing operations) that cause changes in the coat properties of seeds \n\nand set off germination en masse. If nothing is done, the situation will worsen after disturbance.  \n\nThe results of this study also showed that seeds continue to accumulate in the soil with time and that \n\nthe longer nothing is done about an invasion the more likely that there will be extensive and \n\nprolonged recruitment of new plants after initial clearing operations, requiring more resources to deal \n\nwith the problem. Neglecting the problem will also allow invaded stands to advance by approximately \n\n1 m every 2-3 yr (i.e. the age at which new plants first set seeds) while some seeds will be dispersed \n\ngreater distances, creating new invasion foci (Moody and Mack, 1988) representing a threat to non-\n\ninvaded areas, as already confirmed (Marchante et al., 2010; see chapter 4). Additional experiments \n\nare currently being conducted to identify the agents actively involved in long-range dispersal of \n\nA. longifolia seeds in these systems. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors thank to A.

Is that resilience dependent \n\non duration of invasion? How does the accumulated litter layer contribute to the soil seed bank? \n\nLocation: Coastal sand dunes invaded by Acacia longifolia, Portugal. \n\nMethods: Seedling emergence was used to quantify and compare soil seed banks in long-invaded, \n\nrecently invaded and non-invaded areas. Changes in seed banks were also compared to areas \n\nwhere A. longifolia and the litter layer were removed. \n\nResults: Species richness, seedling density and diversity were higher in non-invaded and recently \n\ninvaded areas, than in long-invaded areas. Although there was an apparent similarity between non-\n\ninvaded and recently invaded areas, analyses of species traits revealed differences. Non-invaded \n\nareas had a wider array of traits. Exotic/invasive species dominated invaded seed banks while native \n\nspecies dominated non-invaded seed banks. Life forms, growth forms, longevity and dispersal mode \n\nshowed differences between areas, with cleared plots of long-invaded areas being apparently the \n\nmost similar to non-invaded plots. Acacia longifolia seeds were most abundant in long-invaded \n\nareas, particularly where the litter layer remained. Removal of A. longifolia plus the litter had little \n\neffect on the seed bank composition of recently invaded areas but resulted in noticeable changes in \n\nseed banks of long-invaded areas. \n\nConclusions: Long-invaded areas are less resilient and show a higher reinvasion potential, despite \n\nsevere alteration of the seed banks of both areas. Seed bank studies can be a useful tool to guide \n\nmanagement, but can give misleading results when invasion periods are protracted. \n\nKey-words: Acacia longifolia; diversity; dune ecosystems; resilience of invaded ecosystem; plant \n\ntraits; seedling emergence. \n\nNomenclature source: Franco (1971, 1984) and Franco &amp; Afonso (1994, 1998, 2003) for plant \n\nspecies. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nInvasive species are currently considered one of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide \n\n(Rejm\u00e1nek &amp; Richardson 1996; Richardson &amp; Py\u0161ek 2008). Their impacts include declines in \n\npopulations of native species (Chornesky &amp; Randall 2003) and changes in ecosystems functioning \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n\n(Vitousek &amp; Walker 1989; D'Antonio &amp; Kark 2002; Peperkorn et al. 2005); they also have economic \n\nimpacts (mainly through control efforts and decreasing productivity of agricultural land) (Pimentel et \n\nal. 2005) and there may be related health issues. In Portugal, as in other parts of the world, the \n\nproblem is particularly acute in natural and semi-natural conservation areas (Coblentz 1990; Cowie &amp; \n\nWerner 1993; Dana et al. 2003; Marchante et al. 2004; Aguiar et al. 2007; Foxcroft et al. 2007). \n\nAlthough control of invasive species is a priority, successful rehabilitation of natural habitats is \n\nultimately determined by the extent to which native species are able to re-establish. Natural recovery \n\nof native flora in cleared areas depends largely on the availability of propagules, as well as abiotic \n\nconditions that favour their germination and survival (De Graaf et al. 1998).  \n\nThe soil seed bank includes viable seeds that are present in both the soil and associated litter layer \n\n(Simpson et al. 1989). Assessing seed bank attributes (species richness and composition, species \n\nguilds and seed density) can help to reveal the resilience of invaded ecosystems and to determine \n\nwhether natural regeneration will suffice for rehabilitation or whether other interventions are required. \n\nChanges in structure are considered to be a sensitive measure of changes in a community (Elzinga \n\net al. 2001). According to Frieswyk &amp; Zedler (2006), a resilient seed bank has seed densities typical \n\nof the original system, with many species from many guilds, and a high proportion of native species. \n\nOn the other hand, a degraded seed bank has atypical seed densities, few native species or guilds, \n\nor a high proportion of exotic species. \n\nSeveral authors - see Bossuyt &amp; Honnay (2008) and references there in - are sceptical that \n\nrestoration based on germination from soil seed banks can be successful and note that seed banks \n\nin invaded areas are usually dominated by low numbers of species. Nevertheless, other authors note \n\nthat accumulations of dormant seeds allow native plants to persist through many years of invasion \n\n(Sternberg et al. 2003) and facilitate recovery in cleared areas. In Mediterranean climates the \n\ndominant species in the seed bank are annual plants that show adaptive responses to the \n\nunpredictable nature of the environment they inhabit by producing many seeds. Although the \n\ncomposition of aboveground communities does not necessarily reflect the abundance of species in \n\nthe soil seed bank, in frequently-disturbed areas there is often a close correlation between adult \n\nplant species and species of seeds in the soil (Baptista &amp; Shumway 1998). In densely invaded \n\nsystems, seed bank studies can reveal species that have the potential to play a key role in the \n\nrecovery of the ecosystem after control of the invasive species. The findings can be considered \n\npositive when they show that native species are well represented, and negative when undesirable \n\nspecies are predominant. Such information can be decisive when planning to embark on an \n\nexpensive control programme. \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n\nCoastal dune ecosystems are considered a vulnerable ecosystem type by the International Union for \n\nConservation of Nature and should have the highest priority for conservation action when significant \n\nbiodiversity values are at risk (Shine et al. 2000). Due to stressful conditions (e.g. low soil fertility and \n\nwater availability, sand movement, strong winds and salt spray from the sea) dune ecosystems have \n\ndistinct phytocoenosis which are ecologically distinct (Carter 1995) and include high proportions of \n\nendemic species and habitats (Honrado et al. 2006). They are particularly vulnerable to disturbance \n\nthrough natural perturbations and human activities (Hanson &amp; Lindh 1993; Carter 1995). The stability \n\nand natural dynamics of these ecosystems relies on their diversity of native plant species which bind \n\nthe sand and curb erosion (van der Putten &amp; Peters 1995). Along the Portuguese coast, pristine \n\ndune systems are becoming increasingly rare, with native species being replaced by several invasive \n\nexotic species (Alves et al. 1998). One of these species is Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd which \n\nthreatens plant diversity, changes vegetation structure (Marchante et al. 2003; see chapter 2) and \n\nalters ecosystem functioning (Marchante et al. 2008b, c). \n\nAlthough A. longifolia is an aggressive invader in several ecosystems, including dunes, around the \n\nglobe (Henderson 1995; Weber 2003; Elorza 2004; Marchante et al. 2008b), studies quantifying its \n\nimpacts on natural seed banks and on the resilience of dune systems are scarce. Additionally, there \n\nis a general lack of data on soil seed banks of coastal sand dunes (Owen et al. 2001). In order to \n\ndetermine the role of seed banks in the restoration of invaded communities, and the susceptibility of \n\nsuch communities to reinvasion, the seed banks of areas that had been long- and recently invaded \n\nby A. longifolia were assessed and compared with non-invaded areas. An assessment was also \n\nmade of the effect of removing A. longifolia plants with the underlying litter layer on the residual seed \n\nbank. We hypothesised that: 1) in degraded natural ecosystems that have been overrun with \n\ninvasive species the potential for recovery declines with age of invasion because the composition of \n\nseed banks changes as seeds are removed from the system, through granivory, failed germination \n\nor decay, without being replenished; 2) most of the seeds of the invasive species will be near the soil \n\nsurface so that removal of the litter layer along with the parent plants will reduce the capacity for \n\nreinvasion of cleared areas and; 3) the composition of native species will differ in situations where \n\nleaf litter is removed compared to areas where litter is left intact because seeds of some species \n\noccur predominantly in the surface layers while others occur at depth in the soil.  \n\nMore generally, the study serves as an example which should be of use to the many organisations \n\nglobally that are responsible for the management of invasive plant species in natural areas. It shows \n\nthe type of research that is required, and the kind of questions that should be asked, to get the \n\ninformation that is needed to understand the dynamics of the mix of seeds in the system and the \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\nrelative effects of different types of control operations on these seeds. Doing so will enable \n\nmanagers to develop control methods which will maximise removal of the invader while fostering \n\nseeds of desirable species along with abiotic conditions that favour their germination. \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS  \n\nStudy area - The study area was located in the S\u00e3o Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (SJDNR) which \n\nis situated on the central-northern coast of Portugal (40\u00ba 39\u2019 N, 8\u00ba 44\u2019 W). The reserve covers about \n\n660 ha and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the West and by the Ria de Aveiro estuary to the \n\nEast (location provided at the Appendix 4.1). The climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence, a \n\nmean annual precipitation of 920 mm and mean monthly temperatures ranging from 10.2\u00baC in \n\nJanuary to 20.2\u00baC in June. Dominant winds blow from Northwest and North, approaching from the \n\nOcean. Historically the area supported open vegetation characterized by shrubs, sub-shrubs and \n\nherbs and sporadic small trees. The reserve has been extensively invaded by A. longifolia which \n\nthreatens the high conservation value of the region (Marchante et al. 2004; Marchante et al. 2007). \n\nBesides A. longifolia, the reserve has also been invaded to a lesser extent by Carpobrotus edulis (L.) \n\nN.E.Br. (ice plant) and Cortaderia selloana (Schultes) Asch. &amp; Graebner (pampas grass). \n\nAcacia longifolia was introduced into SJDNR early in the 20th century to curb movement of sand in \n\ncoastal areas, has subsequently proliferated in several areas and has invaded about two thirds of \n\nSJDNR. The stands in SJDNR can be divided into long-invaded and recently invaded areas. Long-\n\ninvaded areas have had dense stands (over 80% cover) of A. longifolia for several decades and are \n\nlargely restricted to a small area located along the South border of the SJDNR, where the sands are \n\nstabilized. The recently invaded areas came about during the 1995 summer when A. longifolia \n\nproliferated (with cover reaching 70%) over a large, previously-unaffected area of the reserve after a \n\nnatural fire which destroyed about 200 ha, eliminating pine plantations and dune vegetation (Silva \n\n1997) in both the primary and stabilized dunes. Before the fire, the burnt areas had low numbers of \n\nA. longifolia plants, mostly in the under-story of Pinus pinaster Aiton. \n\nLarge areas of SJDNR support almost mono-specific stands of A. longifolia trees which are causing \n\na significant change in the community structure (Marchante et al. 2003; chapter 2) and ecosystem \n\nfunctioning (Marchante et al. 2008b; c). These changes include 1) replacement of diverse plant \n\ncommunities, dominated by herbs, sub-shrubs and shrubs species (Neto 1993; Honrado et al. 2006), \n\nwith arboreal stands largely dominated by A. longifolia with native plant species occurring \n\ninfrequently in the understory (chapter 2), and 2) the deposition of large quantities of leaf litter \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n\nranging from (mean \u00b1SE) 2.05 \u00b1 0.24 Kg.m-2 in long-invaded areas to 1.43 \u00b1 0.14 Kg.m-2 in recently \n\ninvaded areas as opposed to 0.55 \u00b1 0.09 Kg.m-2 in non-invaded areas (Marchante et al. 2008b).  \n\nExperimental design - To assess the effects of the A. longifolia invasion on the composition of the \n\nsoil seed bank, two experiments were performed: \n\nEffect of invasion status on the seed banks \u2013 the seed bank composition in areas recently \n\ninvaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia was compared with non-invaded areas. Non-invaded areas \n\nwere selected inside SJDNR on the basis that: a) they were in a comparable dune situation \n\n(interdune, stabilized dune) to the invaded areas; and b) there were no A. longifolia trees in the area. \n\nSmall open areas within the invaded areas contain remnants of the native vegetation, with several \n\nspecies in common with the non-invaded areas, indicating that they had the same floral elements \n\nand seed banks prior to the invasion by A. longifolia. In each area five 10 X 10 m plots were \n\nestablished from which soil samples were collected (see below). \n\nEffect of A. longifolia and litter removal on the seed banks - in both the long-invaded and \n\nrecently invaded areas a complete randomized block design was used to define five blocks, each \n\nconsisting of two 10 X 10 m plots. Each pair of two plots was similar before treatments application. \n\nOne of two treatments was randomly assigned to one plot in each block. The treatments were: a) \n\nplots cleared of A. longifolia by cutting the trees with chainsaws at ground level after which the leaf \n\nlitter layer was removed (designated the \u2018ALR\u2019 treatment); and b) untreated plots with both \n\nA. longifolia and litter left intact (designated the \u2018A\u2019 treatment) (these were the same plots that were \n\nsampled in experiment 1 above). Trees and litter were removed in October 2002 and seed bank \n\nsamples were collected in December 2002.  \n\nSeedling emergency method was used to assess the composition of seed banks. There are some \n\nknown limitations with the method (e.g. species whose seeds require specific stimuli to germinate \n\nmay not be detected) but these are outweighed by the advantages, namely that it readily eliminates \n\ninviable seeds, which can confound the results, and that seedlings are usually more easy to identify \n\nthan seeds. In each plot, three soil samples (15 samples per treatment; cylindrical cores 7.5 cm in \n\ndiameter and 10 cm deep) were collected. A total volume of 6623 cm3 of soil was collected from a \n\nsurface area of 662 cm2 within each treatment. The soil was then sieved (1 cm mesh) to extract \n\nstones, coarse roots and other plant material before being spread on a layer of sterilized subsoil in a \n\ntray (10 x 20 cm in area; 5 cm deep). Trays were kept in a green house with regular irrigation (twice \n\na day) and ambient light and temperature conditions. Germinating seeds were registered fortnightly \n\nand seedlings were grown until positive identification was possible. The plants were then removed \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\nand preserved as herbarium specimens (Herbarium from Escola Superior Agr\u00e1ria de Coimbra). A set \n\nof control trays was installed with a layer of sterilized subsoil only and the seedlings that appeared in \n\nthese were used to correct numbers in the experimental trays for dates after appearance. Seedling \n\nemergence was monitored until no seeds germinated for at least 13 months (January 2004). \n\nData analysis  \n\nSpecies richness, seedlings density and quantity of A. longifolia seedlings - were analysed \n\nseparately for each experiment. For these three parameters data from the three trays of each plot \n\nwere first gathered in a composite sample. Data are presented per 133 cm2 which corresponds to \n\nthe area of three soil cores. To evaluate the effect of the invasion status (experiment 1) on each \n\nparameter a General Linear Model (GLM), with a between-subject design One-Way ANOVA was \n\nperformed. The effect of invasion age and clearing treatment (experiment 2) was evaluated with a \n\nGLM, with a between-subject design Factorial ANOVA. Significant differences detected were then \n\nlocated with the LSD post-hoc test at 5% level of significance. Data on seedlings density of both \n\nexperiments had to be log transformed ( ( )1log +x ) to fulfil ANOVA assumptions (Zar 1996). \n\nSeedlings that died before positive identification were included in the measures of seedling \n\nabundance but not in the analyses of separate species. All the statistical analyses were performed \n\nusing STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc. 2001, www.statsoft.com). \n\nSeedlings diversity and similarity between seed banks \u2013 these parameters were analysed, and \n\nare presented, together (experiment 1 and 2 combined) in order to avoid data repetition. Shannon \n\ndiversity index was calculated for each invasion status and clearing treatment and compared using a \n\nt test proposed by Hutcheson (1970); the index of Shannon ranges from 0 to ? 5, but is usually \n\nfound to fall between 1.5 and 3.5 (Magurran 1988).  \n\nSimilarity between seed banks regarding species composition at different invasion status and \n\ntreatments were analysed with Sorensen\u00b4s Similarity Coefficient (( ( )BACQS += /2 , where A and \n\nB are the species numbers in samples A and B, respectively, and C is the number of species shared \n\nby the two samples), which varies between 0 (different) and 1 (identical).  \n\nFunctional traits - the seedlings were additionally categorized into functional and other traits (Table \n\n4.1). For every treatment and invasion status, the number of seedlings with each attribute was \n\nsummed and divided by the total number of seedlings to produce a relative abundance of seedlings \n\nwith each attribute. Acacia longifolia seedlings and all the other species were treated separately in \n\nthe analyses. Seedlings that did not survive to a stage of development where they could be identified \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n\nto the species level were allocated to attributes whenever possible; the remaining seedlings were \n\nclassified as \u201cundetermined\u201d. \n\nFor calculation of these three parameters, species abundances of all trays of each invasion status \n\nand treatment were first summed to get a total value of abundances per species. \n\nTable 4.1 List of plant functional traits and other categories and attributes used for the analysis of changes. \n\nTrait Attribute * Source  \n\nRaunki\u00e6r life form Therophyte, hemicryptophyte, chamaephyte, geophyte, nanophanerophyte, \nmicrophanerophyte \n\n1, 2 \n\nGrowth form Graminoids (include grasses and sedges), herbs, shrubs, trees 1, 2 \n\nLongevity Short-lived (annual or biennial), perennial (life cycle over more than 2 years) 1, 2 \n\nMain dispersal agent #  No obvious agent, animals, wind 1, 4, 5 \n\nOrigin &amp; habitat Exotic &amp; invasive, native &amp; generalist (species that appear in several different \nhabitats), native &amp; dune specialist (species that are limited to dunes), native &amp; \ndune/generalist (species that despite appearing in more habitats than dunes \nare limited to sandy habitats) \n\n2, 3 \n\nTaxonomy Families represented 2 \n\n1 = Field observations; 2 = Franco (1971, 1984); Franco &amp; Afonso (1994, 1998, 2003); 3 = Marchante et al.

Of these, 182 did not survive long enough to allow \n\nidentification. The unidentifiable seedlings had morphological characters which indicated that they \n\nrepresented predominantly three species and a rare fourth species. Only one species (Salix \n\natrocinerea Brot.) germinated in the control trays (four seedlings in all) and this figure was used to \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n\nadjust counts in the sample trays. Most of the species were herbs, predominantly from Asteraceae \n\n(in all areas) and Caryophyllaceae (in recently invaded areas). Two graminoid taxa, Poaceae (in \n\nrecently invaded area) and Juncaceae (in non-invaded areas), were also represented by several \n\nspecies. Although only five exotic species were identified, three of these were very abundant, namely \n\nConyza sp., Gamochaeta pensylvanica and A. longifolia (Appendix 4.2). \n\nEffect of invasion status on the seed banks \u2013 The density of seedlings was more than double in \n\nrecently invaded and non-invaded areas than in long-invaded areas (F 2, 12 = 6.08, P = 0.015) \n\n(Figure 4.1a). Species richness was also affected by invasion status (F 2, 12 = 3.86, P = 0.050) with \n\nlong-invaded areas having fewer species than recently invaded areas (Figure 4.1b). The seed banks \n\nof long-invaded areas had ca. 4-fold more A. longifolia seedlings than the seed banks of both \n\nrecently- and non-invaded areas (F 2, 12 = 5.76, P = 0.018) (Figure 4.1c). \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nLong-\n\ninvaded\n\nRecently-\n\ninvaded\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\nn\no\n.o\n\nf \ns\n\ne\ne\nd\n\nlin\ng\ns\n/1\n\n3\n3\n c\n\nm\n2\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nLong-\n\ninvaded\n\nRecently-\n\ninvaded\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\nn\no\n.o\n\nf \ns\np\n\ne\nc\nie\n\ns\n/1\n\n3\n3\n\n c\nm\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\na\n\nb\n\nab\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nLong-\n\ninvaded\n\nRecently-\n\ninvaded\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\nA\n.l\no\n\nn\ng\nif\no\n\nlia\ns\ne\ne\nd\nlin\n\ng\ns\n\n/1\n3\n\n3\n c\n\nm\n2\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\n(c)\n\n  \n\nFigure 4.1 Seed bank density (a), species richness (b) and number of A. longifolia seedlings (c) (mean +SE, \ndf = 4) in seed banks of areas long-invaded, recently invaded and non-invaded by A. longifolia.

Acacia longifolia was not included in (a) and (b). \n\nEffect of A. longifolia and litter removal on the seed banks - Although invasion age affected \n\nseedling density in long-invaded and recently invaded areas separately (see experiment 1), there \n\nwas no between factors interaction (F1,16 = 1.54, P = 0.233) nor clearing treatment effect \n\n(F 1, 16 = 0.004, P = 0.951) (Figure 4.2a). There was a significant interaction between invasion age \n\nand treatments on species richness (F 1, 16 = 8.42, P = 0.010) with untreated plots (A) of recently \n\ninvaded areas containing more species than all of the other plots (Figure 4.2b). The number of \n\nA. longifolia seedlings was affected by both the invasion age (F 1, 16 = 15.08, P = 0.001) and the \n\ntreatments (F 1, 16 = 5.56, P = 0.031), with a nearly-significant interaction between these factors \n\n(F 1,16 = 3.77, P = 0.07) (Figure 4.2c). The clearing treatment (ALR) in long-invaded areas markedly \n\nreduced the quantity of A. longifolia seedlings to levels similar to both plots (A and ALR) of recently \n\ninvaded areas (Figure 4.2c). \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-\n\ninvaded\n\nRecently-\n\ninvaded\n\nn\no\n. \no\nf \n\ns\ne\ne\nd\n\nlin\ng\ns\n\n/1\n3\n3\n c\n\nm\n2\n\n(a)\n\na\n\nb\nb\n\na\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-\n\ninvaded\n\nRecently-\n\ninvaded\n\nn\no\n. \no\nf \ns\n\np\ne\nc\nie\n\ns\n/1\n\n3\n3\n c\n\nm\n2\n\n(b)\n\na a\n\nb\n\na\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n10\n12\n14\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-\n\ninvaded\n\nRecently-\n\ninvaded\n\nA\n. \n\nlo\nn\ng\nif\no\n\nlia\n \n\ns\ne\n\ne\nd\nlin\n\ng\ns\n/1\n\n3\n3\n c\n\nm\n2\n\n(c)\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\n  \n\nFigure 4.2 Seed bank density (a), species richness (b), and seedlings of A. longifolia (c) (mean +SE, df = 4) in \nseed banks of areas long-invaded and recently invaded by A. longifolia, in plots where both A. longifolia and \nlitter were removed (ALR) and in untreated plots where A. longifolia was maintained (A). Bars with the same \nletters are not significantly different (LSD &lt;0.05). Acacia longifolia was not included in (a) and (b). \n\nSeedlings diversity and similarity between seed banks \n\nSeedlings diversity - In uncleared plots (A) diversity was significantly higher (p = 0.015) in recently \n\ninvaded areas (2.21) than in long-invaded areas (2.01), but clearing (ALR) inverted the trend \n\n(recently invaded = 1.81, long-invaded = 2.06; p = 0.005). In long-invaded areas, clearing did not \n\naffect diversity (A = 2.01, ALR = 2.06; p = 0.34), while in recently invaded areas clearing caused a \n\nsignificant decrease in diversity (A = 2.21, ALR = 1.81; p &lt;0.0001). In recently invaded areas, \n\nclearing of A. longifolia and litter (ALR) resulted in diversity that was increasingly different from non-\n\ninvaded areas (A = 2.21, non-invaded = 2.23, p = 0.43; ALR &lt;non-invaded, p &lt;0.0001), while in \n\nlong-invaded areas clearing resulted in diversity that was (barely) equal to non-invaded areas \n\n(A &lt;non-invaded, p = 0.027; ALR = non-invaded, p = 0.062). \n\nSimilarity between seed banks - Similarity between invaded areas and non-invaded areas declined \n\nwith length of A. longifolia invasion, with QS = 0.49 being recorded for the pairing of recently invaded \n\nuntreated plots (A) and non-invaded plots, and decreasing to QS = 0.39 for the pairing of long-\n\ninvaded untreated plots (A) and non-invaded areas. When A. longifolia plus litter were removed \n\n(ALR) the similarity between non-invaded species composition and invaded areas increased in both \n\nrecently invaded areas (QS = 0.61) and long-invaded areas (QS = 0.55). \n\nThe similarity value (QS) of the species composition of seed banks was highest (0.67) between the \n\nuntreated (A) and cleared plots (ALR) of long-invaded areas. In recently invaded areas, A and ALR \n\nwere more dissimilar (QS = 0.57). The clearing treatments promoted similarity with QS rising from \n\n0.44 for the comparison of uncleared plots (A) in recently invaded and long-invaded areas to 0.53 for \n\nthe comparison of cleared plots (ALR) in the two areas. \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n\nSeed bank functional and other traits  \n\nAlthough seedling density, species richness and diversity were similar in recently invaded and non-\n\ninvaded areas, the analyses of species traits and their relative abundances revealed substantial \n\ndifferences between these two areas (Figure 4.3). Even greater differences in trait attributes were \n\nnoted when the seed banks of long-invaded areas were compared to those of recently invaded and \n\nnon-invaded areas. In general, the clearing treatment (ALR) induced more changes in community \n\nstructure in long-invaded areas than in recently invaded areas. Broadly, seed banks from non-\n\ninvaded areas displayed a wider array and exhibited more even distribution of trait attributes than \n\nthose from any of the invaded areas. The proportions of undetermined seedlings in the different \n\nareas varied between ca. 10% and 20%. \n\nMore than 30% of the seedlings that germinated in the samples from the untreated (A) long-invaded \n\nareas were A. longifolia. Recently invaded areas had the highest proportion of seedlings of other \n\nexotic and invasive species (Figure 4.3a). The exotic species detected in the seed banks were \n\nConyza spp. and Gamochaeta pensylvanica (Willd.) Cabrera (very abundant particularly in recently \n\ninvaded areas), Carpobrotus edulis (sporadic exclusively in long-invaded samples) and Cortaderia \n\nselloana (sporadic and only in recently invaded samples) (Appendix 4.2). Altogether, different \n\nclasses of native species made up more than 65% of the seedlings that germinated in the samples \n\nfrom non-invaded areas, thus greatly exceeding the proportions observed in both invaded areas. The \n\nhigher proportion of native species were seedlings from dune/generalist species. \n\nNon-invaded areas showed the highest number of life forms (Figure 4.3b), only equalled by cleared \n\nplots (ALR) of long-invaded areas. The relative abundance of life forms was similar in both \n\ntreatments of recently invaded areas, with therophytes comprising the vast majority of seedlings that \n\ngerminated. In long-invaded areas the clearing treatment promoted greater changes in the \n\nproportions of life forms, with therophytes predominating in cleared plots (ALR), but being \n\noutnumbered by A. longifolia seedlings in the samples from untreated plots (A). Microphanerophytes \n\n(represented in the region by Myrica faya Aiton) only germinated rarely and exclusively in trays from \n\nuntreated long-invaded areas (A). Chamaephytes, hemicryptophytes, cryptophytes and \n\nnanophanerophytes were vestigial in all areas. \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invaded .\n\np\nro\n\np\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n o\n\nf \ns\ne\ne\nd\n\nlin\ng\n\ns\n\nnative &amp; dune specific native &amp; dune/generalist\nnative &amp; generalists exotic &amp; invasive\nA. longifolia undetermined\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invaded .\n\np\nro\n\np\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n o\n\nf \ns\n\ne\ne\nd\nlin\n\ng\ns\n \n\n therophytes hemicryptophyte\nchamaephyte cryptophyte\nnanophanerophyte microphanerophyte\nA.longif olia undetermined\n\n(b)\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invaded .\n\np\nro\n\np\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n\n o\nf \n\ns\ne\ne\nd\n\nlin\ng\ns\n\ngraminoids herbs shrubs\n\ntrees A. longifolia  undetermined\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\n(c)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invaded .\n\np\nro\n\np\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n o\n\nf \ns\n\ne\ne\nd\nlin\n\ng\ns\n\nshort lived perenniall\n\nA. longif olia undetermined \n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\n(d)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invaded .\n\np\nro\n\np\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n\n o\nf \ns\ne\ne\nd\n\nlin\ng\ns\n\nw ind animals\nno obvious agent A. longifolia\nundetermined\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\n(e)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nA ALR A ALR\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invaded .\n\np\nro\n\np\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n\n o\nf \n\ns\ne\ne\nd\n\nlin\ng\ns\n\nBrassicaceae Cistaceae Asteraceae\nPoaceae Juncaceae Caryophyllac.\nother families A.longifolia undetermined\n\nNon-\n\ninvaded\n\n(f )\n\n  \n\nFigure 4.3 Relative abundance of emerged seedlings with each attribute of the plant traits (functional and \nother groups) analysed for seed banks of areas non-invaded, long-invaded and recently invaded by \nA. longifolia, in cleared (ALR) and untreated (A) areas: (a) species categories according to their origin &amp; \nhabitat; (b) life forms; (c) growth form; (d) longevity; (e) main dispersal agent; (f) taxonomic diversity according \nto families (families with proportionally less than 5% were grouped under \u201cother families\u201d; details in Appendix \n4.2). \n\nThe seedlings that germinated in the samples from both invaded areas were mainly herbs \n\n(herbaceous dicotyledons), while graminoids and herbs were more evenly represented among the \n\nseeds that germinated in the samples from non-invaded areas (Figure 4.3c). In long-invaded areas \n\nthe removal of both A. longifolia and litter (ALR) almost excluded graminoids. Shrubs and trees \n\n(except for A. longifolia itself) were poorly represented (no more than 1-2%) with shrubs occurring \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n\nonly in cleared plots (ALR) from both invaded areas and non-invaded areas and trees occurring only \n\nin untreated plots (A) from long-invaded areas. \n\nAlmost all the seedlings that germinated were short-lived species (Figure 4.3d) with the exception of \n\nthose that germinated in the samples from untreated plots (A) of long-invaded areas, where \n\nA. longifolia (a perennial) was more abundant. Perennials were almost excluded from the seed \n\nbanks of recently invaded areas. Seedlings of species dispersed by wind were dominant in almost all \n\nsituations (Figure 4.3e). A greater proportion of seedlings in the samples from non-invaded areas \n\nwere species that are dispersed by animals.  \n\nIn terms of taxonomic diversity, Asteraceae was proportionally by far the most abundant family, \n\nbeing only outnumbered by A. longifolia in the untreated plots (A) from long-invaded areas (Figure \n\n4.3f). The next most prominent taxa were Poaceae and Caryophyllaceae in recently invaded areas \n\nand Juncaceae in the non-invaded area. Seeds from almost all the other families were present in low \n\nnumbers (rarely up to 1% of seedlings) and showed some differences between treatments and \n\ninvasion ages (Appendix 4.2.) Aizoaceae, Rubiaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Scrophulariaceae and \n\nMyricaceae were only detected in long-invaded areas, the last being absent from cleared plots \n\n(ALR). Primulaceae and Onagraceae were only found in samples from recently invaded areas. \n\nFabaceae (excluding A. longifolia) only occurred in the non-invaded areas. \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nFrequently-disturbed areas often show a close correlation between adult plants and soil seed bank \n\nspecies (Baptista &amp; Shumway 1998). The system under investigation is highly disturbed by the \n\ninvasion of an exotic species, which may have impacts that are different to other kinds of \n\ndisturbance, and, to a lesser extent, by human pressure (tourism) and management practices (e.g. \n\nfirebreaks and trails management). Our results show that the invaded seed banks at SJDNR do not \n\nclearly resemble either the quasi-mono-specific invaded system or the original interdune dune \n\ncommunity, present before invasion (Neto 1993), although several species characteristic of the \n\ndunes persisted to invasion contributing to recovery of cleared areas (Sternberg et al. 2003). \n\nEffects of invasion status on the seed bank  \n\nA resilient seed bank should include seed densities typical of the system, several species from \n\nseveral guilds, and a high proportion of native species. On the other hand, degraded seed banks \n\nhave altered densities of seeds, few species or guilds and a high proportion of exotic invasive \n\n\n\n \n\n104 \n\nspecies (Frieswyk &amp; Zedler 2006). Both invaded seed banks showed signs of severe degradation, \n\nbeing largely dominated by a few species (Bossuyt &amp; Honnay 2008), namely exotic/invasive species. \n\nThe exotics Conyza spp. and Gamochaeta pensylvanica, both short-lived species, clearly dominated \n\nthe seed bank of recently invaded areas, despite not being particularly abundant in the extant \n\nvegetation (Marchante et al. 2004), while the long-invaded seed bank was dominated by the \n\nperennial A. longifolia accompanied by a few seeds of Carpobrotus edulis, also perennial. The higher \n\nlongevity of the exotic/invasive species present in the seed banks of long-invaded areas indicates a \n\nmore long lasting threat to these areas. Seeds of Acacia species, in particular, are known to have \n\nvery high longevity (Cavanagh 1980; Daws et al. 2007), waiting in the soil for suitable conditions to \n\ngerminate. On the other hand, the natural seed bank of non-invaded areas were more resilient, \n\nhaving a higher diversity of guilds, low abundances of exotic/invasive species and high proportions of \n\nnative species, even though only a small proportion were dune specialists. However, the presence of \n\nA. longifolia seeds in areas not yet invaded showed that there is a risk of future invasion, especially \n\nafter a fire event.  \n\nWhen subject to disturbance, seed bank densities of plant communities may show distinct changes, \n\neither increasing or decreasing (Pierce &amp; Cowling 1991). In any case, the density of seeds in \n\ndegraded communities is frequently distinct from that of corresponding unaltered communities \n\n(Frieswyk &amp; Zedler 2006), which is corroborated by this study: both the decrease in the density of \n\nseeds in long-invaded areas and the increase in total seed density in recently invaded areas (mostly \n\ndue to the exotic annuals referred to above) (Appendix 4.2) indicates degradation. \n\nMeasures of species richness, diversity, attributes of some plant traits, amount of A. longifolia seeds \n\nand similarity to non-invaded areas indicate that seed banks in long-invaded areas are more altered \n\nthan those of recently invaded areas. For instance, Caryophyllaceae were absent and Poaceae were \n\nunderrepresented in long-invaded seed banks, while both taxa were still well represented in recently \n\ninvaded and non-invaded seed banks. The discrepancy could be due to the short-lived seeds which \n\ncharacterise several species of both these families. Studies have shown that Cerastium diffusum \n\n(Caryophyllaceae) (Mack 1976) and Vulpia fasciculata (Poaceae) (Watkinson 1978) do not \n\naccumulate long-lived soil seed banks in dunes. Long-invaded areas are therefore more \n\nimpoverished of native species and are more likely to be reinvaded following manual clearing or fire. \n\nSimilar trends have been found in areas invaded by other Acacia species in South Africa (Holmes &amp; \n\nCowling 1997a; Holmes 2002), although invasion ages were not always monitored in those studies.  \n\nIn long-invaded areas, where A. longifolia had been present continuously for at least 20 years, the \n\ndense canopy and the thick litter layer has at least curtailed, if not prevented, the deposition of seeds \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n\nfrom surrounding areas (e.g. from zoochorous species), as happens in other closed forest systems \n\n(Sayer 2006). Zoochorous plant species do not seem to cope well with A. longifolia invasion (Holmes \n\n&amp; Cowling 1997b), being underrepresented in invaded areas while remaining frequent in non-\n\ninvaded areas. In the recently invaded areas, movement of seeds (particularly from anemochorous \n\nspecies) into the area continued because the canopy of A. longifolia was more open (ca. 70%) and \n\nthe litter layer was more sparse (1.43 \u00b1 0.14 Kg.m-2) than in the long-invaded areas (at least 80% \n\nA. longifolia cover and 2.05 \u00b1 0.24 Kg.m-2 of litter). The time of invasion would also affect seed bank \n\ntraits because the viability of seeds (particularly small seeds) buried for long periods under thick litter \n\nlayers diminishes (Eckstein &amp; Donath 2005) along with the ability of viable seeds to germinate \n\nsuccessfully in thick litter layers (Facelli &amp; Pickett 1991). Noticeably, however, some dune -specific \n\nspecies, e.g. Antirrhinum majus L. cirrhigerum (Ficalho) Franco, with larger and longer-lived seeds \n\n(Shah et al. 2008) seem to have either overcome the barriers to immigration into thickets or survived \n\nthe protracted periods of invasion, being exclusively detected (despite rarely) in long-invaded areas. \n\nTheir absence in recently invaded areas could be due to the seeds being destroyed by the fire of \n\n1995 and there not being enough time between the fire and sample acquisition for fresh seeds to \n\nspread into and accumulate in the invaded patches. \n\nThe high proportion of therophytes in the seed banks was expected as their establishment from seed \n\nis obligatory (Fenner &amp; Thompson 2005), they are frequent in Portuguese dune ecosystems (Alves \n\net al. 1998; Costa et al. 2000) and include many \u2018opportunistic\u2019 species, despite having limited \n\nconservation value (some are exotics). Being short-lived annual species that are relatively small, \n\nthey are largely unable to compete with A. longifolia which is a large perennial species. \n\nNevertheless, if therophytes create a dense cover over the soil surface, they may reduce \n\ngermination of A. longifolia seeds and provide a transitional cover which will later be replaced by the \n\nless-numerous native perennial species in the seed bank. The seeds of perennial species are \n\nusually sparse in seed banks and these plants frequently have an ability to propagate from \n\nperennating buds located on storage structures as an alternative mean of reproduction (Sternberg et \n\nal. 2003). Some natural sand dunes lack persistent seed banks because conditions that induce \n\ndormancy (namely poorly aerated soils) are not always met (Owen et al. 2001). Additionally, \n\nrecruitment of new individuals may have been limited (Thompson &amp; Ceriani 2003) because some \n\nspecies require heat (Buhk &amp; Hensen 2005), smoke (Reyes &amp; Trabaud 2009), passage through \n\nanimal intestines (Calvi\u00f1o-Cancela 2004) or other cues to induce germination and facilitate seedling \n\nemergence (Sternberg et al. 2003; Cottrell 2004). The lack of these types of cues in the glasshouse \n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n\ncould partially explain why ca. 15% of the seedlings in this study (potentially some perennial species) \n\ndid not survive to a stage where they could be identified. \n\nNevertheless, the lack of nanophanerophytes and chamaephytes (long-lived perennials, with many \n\nspecies characteristic of dunes, some with high conservation value), such as Corema album (L.) D. \n\nDon and Cytisus grandiflorus (Brot.) DC. (both endemic of the Iberian Peninsula), Herniaria ciliolata \n\nMelderis subsp. robusta Chaudhri and Iberis procumbens Lange subsp. procumbens (both endemic \n\nin Europe), Crucianela maritima L. and Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don fil. subsp. picardi (Costa \n\net al. 2000; Marchante et al. 2004; Silva 2006), and the very low numbers of other species, including \n\nCistus salvifolius L. and Ulex europaeus L. subsp. latebracteatus (Mariz) Rothm, could also be an \n\nindication of a general degradation of seed banks in the studied dunes. Sampling size could also \n\nhave contributed to the low levels of detection of these species. The deficiency of dune specialists, \n\nparticularly in non-invaded areas, may be due to the fact that the selected non-invaded areas were \n\nnot the most \u201ctypical\u201d dune system, but rather the only places in the reserve that were located in \n\ndune situations that were equivalent to the invaded areas while being free of A. longifolia trees. In \n\nthese areas graminoid species frequently predominate and apparently largely suppress germination \n\nof A. longifolia seeds. The graminoid species that were present (Juncus spp. and Carex arenaria L.) \n\nare frequently associated with relatively moist soils, which were also characteristic of some of the \n\nlong-invaded areas where A. longifolia dominated. Species of Juncus and Carex produce very large \n\namounts of small, long-lived seeds that are abundant in several communities (Bossuyt &amp; Honnay \n\n2008). The presence of these taxa may explain the higher density of seeds when compared to seed \n\nbanks of other sand dunes systems (7-12 germinable seeds.m-2) (Owen et al. 2001).  \n\nBossuyt &amp; Honnay (2008) analysed numerous community seed banks and support the notion that \n\nrestoration from natural seed bank is only possible in areas degraded for less than five years. Our \n\nstudy corroborates this, at least partially, showing a decrease in the unaided recovery potential of the \n\nsystem as invasion age increases. Other studies in the SJDNR have shown that other parameters, \n\nnamely microbiological and chemical properties of the soil in long-invaded stands of A. longifolia are \n\nalso more altered and take more time to recover than in recently invaded stands (Marchante et al. \n\n2009). \n\nEffect of A. longifolia and litter removal on the seed banks \n\nThe effect of removing A. longifolia and the litter layer on species richness, diversity and amount of \n\nA. longifolia seeds varied with age of invasion. Removing A. longifolia and the litter layer resulted in \n\ngreater similarity of the seed banks of long-invaded and recently invaded areas, indicating that an \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n\nimportant part of the differences observed between invaded seed banks occurs among seeds that \n\nhave accumulated over time in the litter layers.  \n\nRemoving A. longifolia and the litter did not affect species diversity, species richness and seed bank \n\ndensity in long-invaded areas. However, litter removal decreased the number of A. longifolia \n\nseedlings, changed several trait spectra and left a seed bank whose species composition more \n\nclosely resembled the seed banks of adjacent non-invaded areas, eventually creating a more-\n\nresilient seed bank (Frieswyk &amp; Zedler 2006). Removing A. longifolia and litter resulted in a further \n\ndecline of some taxa (e.g. Cyperaceae, Rubiaceae, Myricaceae) that had accumulated in the litter \n\nlayer. Nevertheless, this loss was offset to some extent because other taxa appeared in the cleared \n\nareas. These were presumably recent additions which arrived during the short interval between \n\nclearing and collection of seed samples. Most of the plants in this group were herbaceous, short-\n\nlived, wind-dispersed species (particularly Asteraceae) which are frequently opportunistic and typical \n\nfrom early succession stages, and included both native generalists and exotics. More importantly, \n\nremoving the litter decreased the number of A. longifolia seeds in long-invaded areas and thereby \n\ndecreased the reinvasion potential of the invader. Indeed, moderate controlled fire could be used to \n\neliminate the thick litter layer and simultaneously destroy many seeds of the invasive species \n\n(Richardson &amp; Kluge 2008).  \n\nThe number of species, particularly natives, and diversity declined in recently invaded areas when \n\nA. longifolia and the litter were removed, indicating that this type of clearing operation caused a \n\nfurther degradation of the seed bank (Frieswyk &amp; Zedler 2006). Nevertheless, there was \n\nconsiderable similarity in the species composition of seed banks in recently invaded and non-\n\ninvaded areas and clearing treatment did not induce changes in most plant traits. Invasion for a few \n\nyears meant that the canopy was relatively open until recently so that seeds of other plant species \n\ncontinued to accumulate in the litter layer and the time interval was too short for natural attrition of \n\nthe original seeds to have taken affect to any great extent. Removing the litter caused a decline or \n\ndisappearance of some types of seeds, with at least 10 species being lost (Appendix 4.2), an \n\noutcome that would inadvertently contribute to a decline in the resilience of the system.  \n\nAlthough there are limitations in using seedling emergence to monitor species assemblages \n\n(Sternberg et al. 2003; Cottrell 2004), the method had benefits in this case because it: 1) allows an \n\nestimation of the available seed bank without major clearing efforts; 2) revealed species that were \n\notherwise unseen in the invaded stands; and 3) indicated the invasion potential of A. longifolia, \n\nparticularly in non-invaded areas. The results of this study indicated that due to higher \n\nimpoverishment of the seed bank in long-invaded areas, recovery will probably be more dependent \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n\non the input of new seeds into cleared patches from neighbouring areas, a pattern that may not be \n\neasily predicted when sampling the resident seed bank. Due to low seed densities, patchiness of \n\nseed banks and short interval between clearing operations and sampling collection, it is not possible \n\nto confirm that seeds only found in cleared areas (ALR) had necessarily dispersed from neighbouring \n\nareas. Some may have germinated in trays due to litter removal and/or disturbance during the \n\nexperimental manipulations. Increasing the sampling size could eventually contribute do detect more \n\nspecies. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nAs hypothesized, the results of this investigation showed that seed banks of areas invaded by \n\nA. longifolia for a longer period are more altered than the ones from recently invaded areas, \n\nsuggesting that resilience of the system decreases as invasion time increases, namely because \n\nrecovery of native plants from residual seed banks declines with time. The recovery of the coastal \n\ndunes is threatened by the overwhelming presence of A. longifolia and other aggressive invasive \n\nspecies in the seed bank. This situation becomes increasingly problematic with time because seeds \n\nof short-lived exotic species in recently invaded areas are replaced by seeds of perennial invader \n\nspecies in long-invaded areas. Regarding clearing treatment effects, there was a somewhat \n\nunexpected difference between invaded areas. The removal of A. longifolia trees and litter layer in \n\nlong-invaded areas resulted in few species being lost and higher similarity with native areas, \n\nincluding functional trait spectra, which may further enhance recovery of the system. In recently \n\ninvaded areas, on the contrary, the removal of litter contributed to a further degradation of the seed \n\nbank, with many species being lost and a decrease in diversity when compared with areas where \n\nA. longifolia remained. The results also show that the assessment of traits other than species \n\nrichness, abundance and diversity of the soil seed bank revealed patterns that would otherwise have \n\nbeen unnoticed. \n\nFrom a management point of view, if invaded areas are left intact, more vigorous and probably more \n\nexpensive management efforts will then be needed if the invaded systems are to be restored. A \n\nstrategy to control or manage A. longifolia needs to include dealing with reinvasion by seedlings and \n\nsustaining the recovery of native communities, mainly in the long-invaded areas where the removal \n\nof the litter layer was an effective mechanism for decreasing the amount of A. longifolia seeds in the \n\nsystem. Although many native species are present including several species characteristic of the \n\ndunes, which is positive, many others are missing which, especially when summed with exotics, is \n\nnegative and needs to be considered when planning recovery strategies. Seed banks alone do not \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n\nseem to be sufficient to allow full system recovery after clearing. Chapter 5 evaluates the recovery of \n\nvegetation after the removal of trees with or without the litter layer, including the time factor, which \n\nfurther assists in the validation of the present approach. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThe authors thank to E.

Despite having the highest priority for conservation by IUCN, the structure and function of many \n\ncoastal dunes are threatened by invasive plant species. In Portuguese dunes, Acacia longifolia is \n\none of the most prominent invasive species. Removal of invasive plants is crucial for preventing loss \n\nof biodiversity but the likelihood that restoration efforts will succeed should be assessed before \n\nembarking in expensive management plans. However, post-clearing studies are scarce, usually \n\nshort-term and rarely consider duration of invasion. \n\n2. Recovery of plant communities was monitored over six years in a coastal dune after removal of \n\nA. longifolia either with or without the associated litter layer. Duration of the invasion period before \n\nclearing was considered. Species richness, plant cover, diversity, evenness, species traits and \n\nturnover rates were analysed. \n\n3. Duration of invasion was the main determinant of resilience of invaded systems. Recently invaded \n\nareas had higher species richness, plant cover, initial diversity and turnover rates than long-invaded \n\nareas. The post-clearing flora of both areas was dominated by generalist native species which, over \n\ntime, were increasingly replaced by species more adapted to dunes. However, six years after \n\nremoval of A. longifolia several species typical of dunes were still missing. Exotic species were more \n\nabundant in recently invaded areas. Therophytes were the most abundant life form immediately after \n\nclearing but nanophanerophytes, chamaephytes and A. longifolia increased with time. \n\n4. Seedlings of A. longifolia were more abundant in cleared long-invaded areas. Effects of litter \n\nremoval were most evident in cleared long-invaded areas, promoting increased species richness and \n\nplant cover, and decreasing susceptibility to reinvasion. \n\nSynthesis and applications: Sand dunes densely invaded by a woody species have some inherent \n\nresilience but, as the invasion periods extends, recovery of the original communities is increasingly \n\nless likely and the probability of reinvasion increases. Therefore, more-recently invaded areas should \n\nbe prioritized for clearing. When invasion is accompanied by an accumulation of litter, this should be \n\nremoved to enhance recovery of native flora. In most situations, restoration needs to be supported \n\nby active management actions (e.g. litter removal, transplantations, fire); to establish the original \n\necosystem may be an unrealistic restoration target. \n\nKeywords: ecosystem resilience, Fabaceae/Leguminosae, Sydney golden wattle, long-term \n\nmonitoring post-clearing, invasion time, experimental litter removal, reinvasion post-clearing.  \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nInvasive plant species are considered one of the primary threats to biodiversity (Richardson et al., \n\n2000; Richardson et al., 2008; Gaertner et al., 2009) as well as to the integrity and function of \n\necosystems (Vitousek, 1990; Blossey, 1999; Marchante et al., 2008a). Ever-escalating problems \n\ncaused by invasive species increasingly require intervention for their removal and the restoration of \n\nnatural habitats. Before embarking on expensive management programs, the probability that \n\nrestoration efforts will succeed should be assessed, including the possibility that the invasive species \n\nwill reinvade after its initial removal (Zavaleta, Hobbs &amp; Mooney, 2001). Long-term monitoring after \n\ncontrol operations can provide valuable ecological information by revealing how changes in the \n\nabundance of species influences properties and processes of ecosystems, which in turn helps to \n\nguide management decisions (Blossey, 1999). Despite these real benefits, most studies on the \n\neffects of invasive plants removal are of short duration and/or frequently fail to include effects on \n\nnative plant species (Ogden &amp; Rejm\u00e1nek, 2005; Hejda &amp; Py\u0161ek, 2006). \n\nCoastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to disturbance and have been given the highest \n\npriority for conservation action by IUCN (Shine, Williams &amp; G\u00fcndling, 2000). Coastal dune \n\necosystems are not only fundamental barriers against the advance of the ocean (Carter, 1995), they \n\nalso harbour endemic plant species and form unique habitats (Honrado et al., 2006). The stability \n\nand natural dynamics of coastal dunes relies on natural plant communities which stabilise the labile \n\nsands and minimize the effects of erosion (van der Putten &amp; Peters, 1995). \n\nAlong the Portuguese coast, pristine dune systems are becoming increasingly rare, with native plant \n\nspecies being replaced by several invasive exotic species, including Acacia longifolia (Andrews) \n\nWilld (Alves et al., 1998; Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003), A. saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. \n\n(Marchante, 2001), Carpobrotus edulis (L.) N. E. Br. (Campelo, 2000) and Cortaderia selloana \n\n(Schultes) Asch. &amp; Graebner (Marchante, Freitas &amp; Marchante, 2008). Acacia longifolia (long-leafed \n\nwattle) (Fabaceae/ Leguminosae), the most prominent and widespread invader in Portuguese dunes, \n\nwas introduced in early 20th century to curb sand erosion. Besides deliberate planting, its abundance \n\nand distribution has increased greatly following fire events with major impacts that escalate with time \n\n(Marchante et al., 2008b; chapter 2). In common with other Acacia species, A. longifolia is a nitrogen \n\nfixing tree (Rodr\u00edguez-Echeverr\u00eda, Cris\u00f3stomo &amp; Freitas, 2007) that produces large quantities of \n\nslowly-decomposing litter (Pereira, Graca &amp; Molles, 1998; Marchante, 2008) which accumulates in \n\ndeep layers beneath the almost mono-specific, dense stands in dune areas which are otherwise \n\nalmost litter deprived. \n\n\n\n \n\n120 \n\nPlant litter and its decomposition are considered a vital part of ecosystem functioning, increasingly \n\ninfluencing vegetation structure as litter accumulates (Xiong &amp; Nilsson, 1999). Its effects vary among \n\necosystems and depend on litter composition and quantity, with repercussion for species richness \n\nand above-ground biomass (Facelli &amp; Pickett, 1991; Sayer, 2006). In general, litter suppresses \n\ngermination of small seeds and seedling establishment, while germination of large seeds and \n\nseedling establishment are facilitated (Sayer, 2006). Suppression occurs because litter forms a \n\nbarrier which prevents seeds from reaching the soil. Small seeds that germinate in the litter layer fail \n\neither because their roots do not reach the soil, or their shoots are unable to reach the surface \n\n(Facelli &amp; Pickett, 1991). In large-seeded species survival may be facilitated because the seeds are \n\nless likely to be retained by the litter and input of nutrients from the decomposing litter may nurture \n\nseedlings while the litter protects the seeds and seedlings from predators (Sayer, 2006). The \n\npotential for major disruption of ecosystems is most evident when invasive species that produce \n\nlarge quantities of litter invade ecosystems that naturally have less litter. In such cases, the ever \n\nincreasing quantities of litter result in abnormal accumulations of organic matter which persists \n\nbecause there is insufficient or inappropriate soil fauna and microbiota to decompose it properly.  \n\nConsidering that plant communities are dynamic through time, evaluation of recovery of ecosystems \n\nafter removal of invasive plants requires median to long-term monitoring. However, most of these \n\ntypes of studies have been too short to provide comprehensive results (Maron &amp; Jefferies, 2001; \n\nBerlow, D'Antonio &amp; Swartz, 2003; Ogden &amp; Rejm\u00e1nek, 2005; Hejda &amp; Py\u0161ek, 2006). Furthermore, \n\nstudies which consider duration of invasion prior to clearing are very scarce (Strayer et al., 2006). \n\nAgainst this background, we carried out a study to evaluate the resurgence of native and exotic plant \n\nspecies over a six year period in a coastal dune ecosystem dominated by A. longifolia for different \n\ndurations, predicting that the resilience of communities of native species will decrease as invasion \n\ntime increases and that removal of litter along with the invasive plants will facilitate recovery of native \n\nplant communities. The experimental set up was established in order to test management solutions \n\nand offer concrete recommendation to managers dealing with invasive species. \n\nMETHODOLOGY \n\nStudy site - The study area was located in the S\u00e3o Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (hereafter \n\nSJDNR) which is located on the central-northern coast of Portugal (40\u00ba 39\u2019 N, 8\u00ba 44\u2019 W). SJDNR \n\ncovers about 660 ha and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the West and by the Ria de Aveiro \n\nestuary to the East. The climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence. The mean annual \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\nprecipitation is 920 mm and mean monthly temperatures range from 10.2\u00baC in January to 20.2\u00baC in \n\nJune. Dominant winds blow from the Northwest and North, approaching from the Ocean. Historically, \n\nthe area supported open vegetation characterized by several communities dominated by shrub and \n\nherb species and sporadic small trees (Neto, 1993; Honrado et al., 2006).  \n\nAcacia longifolia, which was introduced into SJDNR early in the 20th century to curb movement of \n\nsand, has subsequently proliferated and extensively invaded much of the reserve (Marchante et al., \n\n2008b). When this study took place, A. longifolia was dominant over 150 ha and occurred in mixed \n\nassociation with other plant species over 200 ha (Guimar\u00e3es, 2004). Other exotic species such as \n\nCarpobrotus edulis and Cortaderia selloana were also invasive in the area but to a lesser extent. The \n\ninvaded portions of SJDNR can be divided into long-invaded and recently invaded areas. Long-\n\ninvaded areas have had A. longifolia for several decades and are largely restricted to a small portion \n\nalong the South border of the SJDNR. The recently invaded areas came about when A. longifolia \n\nproliferated over a large (previously-unaffected) area of the reserve after a natural fire which \n\ndestroyed about 200 ha of vegetation, including pine plantations, during the 1995 summer (Silva, \n\n1997). Before the fire, the burnt areas had low numbers of A. longifolia plants, mostly in the under-\n\nstory of Pinus pinaster Aiton. The mono-specific, arboreal stands of A. longifolia had caused \n\nsignificant changes in community structure (Marchante et al. 2003) and ecosystem functioning \n\n(Marchante et al. 2008b, 2008c), including deposition of large quantities of leaf litter (Marchante et \n\nal., 2008b), reduction of light at soil level and replacement of diverse herbaceous and shrubs \n\ncommunities (Neto, 1993; Honrado et al., 2006; chapter 2). \n\nExperimental design - In each of the two invaded areas (long and recently invaded), a complete \n\nrandomized block design was used to define five blocks, each consisting of three 100 m2 plots with \n\nsimilar A. longifolia cover. One of three treatments was randomly assigned to one plot in each block. \n\nThe treatments were: 1) plots cleared of A. longifolia (abbreviated AR) by cutting the trees with \n\nchainsaws at ground level; 2) plots where A. longifolia trees were removed and the litter layer was \n\nalso removed (ALR); and 3) plots with both A. longifolia and litter left intact as untreated controls (A). \n\nAfter treatments had been applied according to the experimental design, conditions in cleared plots \n\n(AR and ALR) were distinctly different from untreated plots (A) (Table 5.1). \n\nAfter trees and litter were removed in October 2002, two 2 x 10 m transects were demarcated to \n\nrecord plant species growing in each plot. Transects were monitored twice a year (late January/early \n\nFebruary and May), from December 2002 to May 2004, and then once every 2 years until May 2008. \n\nParameters measured were: 1) plant species present, 2) species cover, 3) number of A. longifolia \n\nseedlings and 4) soil litter coverage. \n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n\nTable 5.1 Characterization of experimental plots, after establishment, in areas long-invaded and recently \ninvaded by Acacia longifolia.   \n\n  A. longifolia \nmaintained (A) \n\nA. longifolia \nremoved (AR) \n\nA. longifolia + litter \nremoved (ALR) \n\nSource \n\nA. longifolia  Recently-invaded Ca. 70% -- -- \n\ncover (%) Long-invaded > 80% -- -- \n\n(1) \n\nLeaf litter (Kg.m-2) Recently-invaded 1.43 \u00b1 0.14 -- \n\n Long-invaded 2.05 \u00b1 0.24 -- \n\n(2) \n\nLight intensity (at soil Recently-invaded 283.6 \u00b1 61.4 1093.5 \u00b1 127.1  \n\nlevel) (?mol.m-2.S-1) Long-invaded 170.2 \u00b1 41.0 1061.1 \u00b1 73.9  \n (1) Chapter 2; (2) Marchante et al. (2008b). \n\n \n\nData analysis - Recovery of plant communities post-clearing: recovery of communities was first \n\ncharacterized using measures of species richness, plant cover, Shannon diversity and evenness \n\nseparately. Because A. longifolia was the potential driver of change in the plant community, it was \n\nexcluded from the analysis of species richness and total plant cover. Pielou evenness index J (from \n\n0 to 1) and Shannon diversity index H\u2019 (from 0 to ? 5, but usually found to fall between 1.5 and 3.5) \n\ncalculations included A. longifolia as these indexes reflect the presence of a dominant species \n\n(Magurran, 1988). All parameters were analyzed by repeated-measures MANOVA with time post- \n\nclearing as a within subject factor and invasion status and treatment as between-groups factors. \n\nSpecies traits and turnover rate in plant communities post-clearing: the species were categorized \n\ninto biological and ecological attributes which were classified under traits (Table 5.2).  \n\nTable 5.2 Plant traits and their respective attributes used to classify the species recorded in the study plots \n\nTrait Attribute  Source  \n\nBiological trait: \nRaunki\u00e6r life forms * \n\nTherophyte, hemicryptophyte, chamaephyte, geophyte, \nnanophanerophyte, microphanerophyte  \n\n1, 2 \n\nEcological trait: \nSpecies biogeographic \ndistribution \n\nExotic &amp; invasive, native &amp; generalist (species that occur in \nseveral different habitats), native &amp; dune specialist (species that \nare limited to dunes), native &amp; dune/generalist (species that \noccur in dunes and other habitats but are limited to sandy soils) \n\n2, 3 \n\n1 = Field observations; 2 = Franco &amp; Afonso (1971-2003); 3 = Marchante, Freitas &amp; Marchante (2008). \n\n* In species with more than one attribute, the attribute dominant in the studied system was considered. \n\n \n\n For each treatment, the area covered by species with a particular attribute was summed and divided \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\nby the total area covered by all the species within the trait, to produce a relative abundance of each \n\nattribute per treatment. Acacia longifolia was treated separately. \n\nSpecies turnover rate (TR) was calculated to measure species shifts between May 2003 and 2008, \n\nas follows: TR =0.5 (L+G), where L is the number of species lost and G is the species gained during \n\na defined period (Hilli, Kuitunen &amp; Suhonen, 2007). Turnover rates differences were analysed with a \n\n2-way factorial ANOVA. The time interval represents the changes observed in the full study period, \n\nwith measurement made each year in the same season being compared to avoid seasonal effects as \n\na source of discrepancy. \n\nSusceptibility to (re)invasion post-clearing was based on: a) number of A. longifolia seedlings; and b) \n\nA. longifolia cover (saplings and trees), which were analyzed by repeated-measures MANOVA with \n\ntime post-clearing as a within subject factor and invasion status and treatment as between-groups \n\nfactors. \n\nIn all statistical analyses, mean differences were separated with LSD test at 5% level of significance. \n\nSTATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc., 2001, http://www.statsoft.com) was used. \n\nRESULTS \n\nRecovery of plant communities post-clearing Over the six year monitoring period, 83 species \n\nof vascular plants in 26 families were identified in the survey plots; six were exotics and 77 natives. \n\nThere were 77 species in recently invaded areas as opposed to 56 species in long-invaded areas. \n\nMore species were found in plots where both A. longifolia and litter were removed (ALR) (74 species \n\nand 49 species in recently- and long-invaded plots, respectively) than in cleared areas where only \n\nA. longifolia was removed (AR) (64 species and 48 species in recently- and long-invaded plots, \n\nrespectively). In untreated areas (A) there were approximately half as many species (36 species and \n\n26 species in recently- and long-invaded plots, respectively) as in the cleared areas (Appendix 5.1). \n\nA significant interaction between invasion age, clearing treatments and time post-clearing for species \n\ncover (F12, 60 = 10.82, P &lt;0.0001) and species richness (F12, 60 = 2.67, P = 0.006) was verified. In the \n\nfirst two months after clearing, neither plant cover (Figure 5.1) nor species richness (Figure 5.2) \n\nshowed clear patterns of change, with some exceptions, e.g. by December 2002, in plots in recently \n\ninvaded areas where only A. longifolia had been removed (AR), species richness was higher than in \n\nall the other plots. There was a significant increase of species cover (Figure 5.1) and richness \n\n(Figure 5.2) in both cleared plots (AR and ALR), that ranged from ca. 20% cover and four species \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n\nimmediately after clearing, to more than 80% cover and 12 species by May 2006. Generally, in \n\nuntreated plots (A) plant cover was sparser and species richness was lower than in cleared plots (AR \n\nand ALR) of both invaded areas; both of these parameters showed little change over time.  \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nD\ne\nc\n\n-0\n2\n\nF\ne\nb\n\n-0\n3\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n3\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n6\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n8\n\nD\ne\nc\n\n-0\n2\n\nF\ne\nb\n\n-0\n3\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n3\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n6\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n8\n\nD\ne\nc\n\n-0\n2\n\nF\ne\nb\n\n-0\n3\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n3\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n6\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n8\n\nD\ne\nc\n\n-0\n2\n\nF\ne\nb\n\n-0\n3\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n3\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n6\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n8\n\nD\ne\nc\n\n-0\n2\n\nF\ne\nb\n\n-0\n3\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n3\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n6\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n8\n\nD\ne\nc\n\n-0\n2\n\nF\ne\nb\n\n-0\n3\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n3\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n4\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n6\n\nM\na\ny\n\n-0\n8\n\nA AR ALR A AR ALR\n\nLong-invaded Recently-invaded\n\nP\nla\n\nn\nt \nc\no\n\nv\ne\n\nr \n(%\n\n)\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nd\n\ne\n\nf\nd\n\ne\n\nf\n\ng\n\nh\nh\n\np m\n\nn\n\nc\n\nd\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nc\n\nd\n\ng\n\nh\n\ns\n\nn\n\no\ne\n\nf\n\ng\nd\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\ni\n\nd\n\nm\n\nn\n\no\n\nr\n\ni\n\nj\n\nm\n\nn\n\no\n\nq\n\ns\n\nd\n\ne\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nj\n\nl\n\nm\n\nn\n\na\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\no\n\np\ni\n\nj\n\na\n\nb\n\nl\n\nm\n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 Changes in plant cover (mean +SE; n = 10) over time after clearing treatments in areas long-\ninvaded and recently invaded by Acacia longifolia: AR - A. longifolia removed, ALR - both A. longifolia and \nlitter layer removed, and A - A. longifolia maintained.

Analyses of species traits \n\nshowed more changes in cleared plots (AR and ALR) than in untreated plots (A) (Figure 5.4).

Although their relative \n\nabundance declined with time, they remained the most abundant group in all the plots except those \n\nwithout litter (ALR) in long-invaded areas where nanophanerophytes became dominant \n\n(Figure 5.4a). The proportions of chamaephytes, nanophanerophytes and A. longifolia increased with \n\ntime. Several life forms were absent, or rare (relative abundance less than 1%), in untreated plots (A) \n\nof recently- and long-invaded areas. \n\nThe majority of species that appeared in cleared plots were natives (Figure 5.4b) accounting for over \n\n70% of the cover.

Abbreviations as for Figure 5.1. \n\nThe most abundant species in all of the cleared plots were generalists, including species associated \n\nwith both dunes and other sandy habitats (dune/generalists) as well as others associated with a \n\nwider range of habitats (generalist). In the early phase of recovery, the wide-ranging generalist \n\nspecies were prevalent but decreased with time, while dune/ generalists increased with time, \n\nespecially in long-invaded areas. Several exotic, invasive species were detected in cleared plots of \n\nboth areas by May 2003, their abundance increasing proportionately with time in recently invaded \n\nareas, especially in cleared plots without litter (ALR). The relative abundance of species typical from \n\ndunes was highest in cleared plots of long-invaded areas, particularly when only A. longifolia was \n\nremoved (AR). \n\nSpecies turnover was affected by invasion time (F 1, 54 = 9.99, P = 0.003) and clearing treatments \n\n(F 2, 54 = 24.26, P &lt;0.001) with no interaction between factors (F 2, 54 = 0.89, P = 0.418).

(2000)) converting diverse native \n\nareas into species poor, unrecognizable landscapes with several attributes of both biotic and abiotic \n\ncomponents altered (Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003; Marchante et al., 2008a, b). This study \n\nshowed that despite the severe impacts, the removal of almost mono-specific stands of an invader \n\nmay result in a progressive increase in native species richness, plant cover and life forms revealing \n\ninherent resilience within the system. However, as the invasion period extends, the areas become \n\nless resilient mainly due to incremental loss of native species. The finding that native species \n\nnoticeably dominate after clearing, in all situations, suggests that degradation thresholds had not yet \n\nbeen crossed (Aronson et al., 1993; King &amp; Hobbs, 2006) and autogenic recovery occurred to a \n\ncertain extent with continuous improvement in several ecosystem attributes. \n\nAfter clearing off the invader, soil microbiology and chemistry (Marchante et al., 2009), light and litter \n\nlayer conditions, native seed-bank (chapter 4; Marchante, Freitas &amp; Hoffmann, 2010b) and several \n\ncomponents of plant communities seemed to slowly recover until they more-closely resembled the \n\npreinvasion situation (chapter 2). Although most of the recovering species were generalists, there \n\nwere also several species characteristic of dunes in the mix, e.g. Corema album (L.) Don, Iberis \n\nprocumbens Lange subsp. procumbens and Pseudorlaya minuscule (Font Quer) La\u00edz (see Appendix \n\n5.1 for more), species which are relevant for conservation, not only because some are endemic but \n\nalso because are components of the original communities. Nevertheless, six years after clearing \n\nmany species characteristic of dunes were still missing, resulting in communities that were not fully \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n\nrepresentative of the characteristic species assemblages and indicating that dune communities take \n\na long time to return to their initial states, if ever.  \n\nDecreased resilience with invasion time occurred similarly in South African \u2018fynbos\u2019 invaded by other \n\nAcacia species, although species characteristic of the original ecosystem were apparently better \n\nrepresented (Holmes &amp; Cowling, 1997b). Conversely, other post-clearing studies have shown higher \n\nabundance of exotic species than natives (Ogden &amp; Rejm\u00e1nek, 2005; Hulme &amp; Bremner, 2006) and \n\nno cumulative increase in species richness with time (Maron &amp; Jefferies, 2001). In fact, the seed-\n\nbanks of SJDNR had higher abundance of exotic short-lived species (chapter 4; Marchante, Freitas \n\n&amp; Hoffmann, 2010b) than is apparent in this field study; this is most likely a mismatch because the \n\nfew exotics that were abundant as seeds were not able to provide a persistently high cover in the \n\nfield. \n\nThe higher species turnover of recently invaded areas was possibly related to the higher variability of \n\nspecies in the seed banks with probable dependence on different stimuli for germination which was \n\nconsequently staggered. Soils of recently invaded areas also had lower nutrient content (Marchante \n\net al., 2008b), a condition which is associated with higher species turnover rates (Warren et al. \n\n2009).  \n\nThe recovery process was very dynamic and 6 years after clearing some shifts in species and \n\npatterns were obvious, e.g., the area covered by the native shrubs Cistus salvifolius L. and Cytisus \n\ngrandiflorus (Brot.) DC. (endemic to Iberian Peninsula) and the invader itself, increased substantially. \n\nThis was accompanied by a reduction in total plant cover (excluding A. longifolia) and diversity due \n\nto a substantial decline of some generalist, early coloniser species, mainly Poaceae but also \n\nAsteraceae (Appendix 5.1), which were especially abundant in plots soon after clearing. Some \n\nchanges observed during recovery would have been missed in a shorter study, corroborating that \n\nstudies post-clearing of invasive plants should continue for extended periods than most analogous \n\nstudies (Holmes &amp; Cowling, 1997b; Ogden &amp; Rejm\u00e1nek, 2005; Hejda &amp; Py\u0161ek, 2006).  \n\nIs this system susceptible to (re)invasion after clearing? \n\nRegrowth from cut stumps was negligible in the cleared plots, though clearing in other areas of \n\nSJDNR resulted in high levels of resprouting (Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2004). The \n\nabundance of A. longifolia seedlings, particularly in long-invaded cleared plots, made cleared areas \n\nsusceptible to reinvasion. The densities of seedlings were much lower than the densities of seeds in \n\nthe soil (chapter 3; Marchante, Freitas &amp; Hoffmann, 2010c) probably due to the absence of fire which \n\nstimulates germination (Pieterse &amp; Cairns, 1986). \n\n\n\n \n\n130 \n\nMost A. longifolia seedlings failed to survive to saplings, confirming that estimates of reinvasion \n\npotential should be based on established plants instead of seedlings (Galatowitsch &amp; Richardson, \n\n2005). The successful reinvasion by A. longifolia was highest on cleared plots where litter (mainly \n\ncomposed of A. longifolia abscised phyllodes) remained and consequently retained seeds and \n\nelevated soil nutrients (Marchante et al., 2008b). This positive feed-back, where the invader creates \n\nconditions that favour itself, has been noted by Milton (1981) and by Ehrenfeld et al (2003). \n\nThe cover of Carpobrotus edulis, another aggressive invader, also increased after A. longifolia \n\nremoval, particularly in recently invaded areas, thereby representing an additional impediment to \n\nnative recovery. Being a species with vegetative reproduction (Roiloa et al., 2009), the clearing \n\noperations probably fragmented C. edulis plants and favoured its spread. Other exotics \n\n(Gamochaeta pensylvanica (Willd.) Cabrera, Conyza spp. and Cortaderia selloana) were also found \n\nin the cleared areas. Disturbance caused by clearing operations frequently promotes reinvasion by \n\nthe target species, or by other alien species (Hobbs &amp; Huenneke, 1992; Luken, Kuddes &amp; \n\nTholemeier, 1997; D'Antonio &amp; Meyerson, 2002; Dodson &amp; Fiedler, 2006), emphasizing the need for \n\nfollow up control (Campbell, 2000; Galatowitsch &amp; Richardson, 2005). \n\nWhat are the implications of this study for dune ecosystems\u2019 management? \n\n In systems where invasions are vast, persistent and include a substantial seed bank of the invader, \n\nsuch as A. longifolia in the Portuguese dune ecosystems (Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003; \n\nchapter 3; Marchante et al., 2008b, a), eradication is an unrealistic goal (Mack &amp; Lonsdale, 2002). \n\nControl measures aimed at reducing the abundance of the invader to less problematic levels and \n\nrestoring some of the lost structural and functional components of the ecosystem seem feasible, \n\ndespite hardly being able to recreate the historical landscape. The goal should be to prioritize \n\ninvaded areas, based on likelihood of successful restoration and on the conservation value of the \n\nareas (Wittenberg &amp; Cock, 2005), and then to find the best way to achieve improvement. Our study, \n\nas others (Holmes &amp; Cowling, 1997b), recommend that recently invaded areas should be prioritized \n\nfor control because recovery of both natural vegetation (this study) and soil parameters (Marchante \n\net al., 2009), is likely to be more successful and at less cost. Nonetheless, even in recently invaded \n\nareas simply removing the invader does not seems to be sufficient to fully restore the system. \n\nAdditional manipulation is required (King &amp; Hobbs, 2006), namely planting desirable species, \n\nremoving the litter and/or depleting the invasive seed bank. \n\nSpecies that are characteristic of dunes (e.g., Crucianella maritima L., Artemisia campestre L. subsp. \n\nmaritima Arcangeli, Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don fil. subsp. picardi (Boiss. &amp; Reuter) Franco) \n\n\n\n \n\n131 \n\nand were recorded as scarce/absent should be sown or transplanted to accelerate recovery, as far \n\nas is possible according to the species assemblages typical of each dune community. This has been \n\nsuccessfully achieved in some restoration projects (Hartman &amp; McCarthy, 2004). Transplanting will \n\nprobably be more effective as saplings (cultivated or moved from adjacent dune) will have a height \n\nadvantage over the invasive seedlings (Galatowitsch &amp; Richardson, 2005), even though this \n\napproach might be limited by a lack of available native dune species ready to transplant. \n\nThe clearing methods may also have implications for the success of restoration (Holmes &amp; Cowling, \n\n1997b; Holmes et al., 2000). Removing thick litter layers is necessary in systems that are naturally \n\nlitter poor, such as the dunes (Marchante et al., 2008b). This measure hastened the recovery of \n\nnative species (Appendix 5.1) and decreased reinvasion potential, particularly in long-invaded areas \n\nwhere there was a more-substantial, slowly-decomposing litter layer (Pereira, Graca &amp; Molles, 1998; \n\nMarchante, 2008). Conversely, in recently invaded areas most of the seeds (or other propagules) \n\nthat germinated soon after clearing were accumulated in the thinner litter layer and were lost with its \n\nremoval. Lack of seeds in long-invaded litter was probably due to: (i) the disruption of recruitment of \n\nnew seeds (Holmes &amp; Cowling, 1997b, a); (ii) additional loss of seed viability with time; and (iii) \n\nfailure of seedlings to establish (Facelli &amp; Pickett, 1991). As the post-clearing period increased, more \n\npropagules entered the cleared plots from surrounding areas and the number of species, particularly \n\nin recently invaded areas, became increasingly similar in both cleared plots. Litter, even more when \n\nthe accumulated layer increases, often suppresses germination and establishment of small seeded \n\nspecies (Xiong &amp; Nilsson, 1999; Sayer, 2006) which were frequent in cleared areas. Myrica faya and \n\nC. album, species typical of dunes, and the invader itself, have relatively large seeds whose \n\nseedlings survived germination through the deep litter layers. Low-intensity fire could be used to \n\nclear A. longifolia because it removes the nitrogen-rich litter and scorches seeds thereby depleting \n\nthe seed bank (Holmes &amp; Cowling, 1997b). \n\nThe size of the area that is cleared apparently influences the recovery process, with resurgence of \n\nA. longifolia less likely and successful recovery more probable when small areas are cleared. \n\nSubsequently cleared areas may be progressively increased. Under natural conditions smaller gaps \n\ndisappear more rapidly than larger gaps through encroachment of the surrounding vegetation \n\n(Fenner &amp; Thompson, 2005). Additionally, small scale clearing operations generate lower levels of \n\ndisturbance being less of a stimulus to germination of A. longifolia seeds. Clearing operations over \n\nseveral hectares that took place elsewhere in SJDNR resulted in a much higher (sometimes over \n\n70% A. longifolia cover) and more rapid (less than two years) reinvasion. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n132 \n\nIn conclusion, sand dunes densely invaded by woody species have inherent resilience which \n\ndecreases as invasion time extends. Regardless of time of invasion, autogenic recovery of cleared \n\nareas can be enhanced by active management actions which maximise, and generate synergy \n\nbetween abiotic and biotic components of the system (King &amp; Hobbs, 2006). For example, the initial \n\nclearing of thickets of the invasive species and the additional removal of the litter layer (practice that \n\nmay be improved if achieved with fire that additionally reduces the invader seed bank) foster abiotic \n\nchanges, e.g., light increase, decrease of barriers to germination and disruption of N addition. Such \n\nchanges will favour desirable, and a few undesirable, species. Subsequent transplantation of missing \n\nnative species can be used to further encourage re-establishment of the natural communities and \n\nsimultaneously reduce subsequent reinvasion (Hulme, 2006). However, encroachment of the invader \n\nafter initial control will be vigorous and needs to be further curtailed. This can be done on a \n\nsustainable basis by introducing a biological control agent, as Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, \n\nwhich has been successfully used for that purpose in South Africa and is being studied in Portugal \n\n(Dennill et al., 1999; Marchante, Freitas &amp; Hoffmann, 2010a; chapter 6). The full recovery of \n\necosystems to their original state (both structurally and functionally) may be very long-lasting and \n\nthus an unrealistic restoration target. \n\n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n\nThe authors thank E.

In South Africa, its spread was \n\ncontrolled by a bud-galling wasp, Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, a strategy that could also be \n\napplied in Portugal. Biological control of invasive alien plants has received little consideration \n\nanywhere in Europe and has never been attempted in Portugal. The lack of a suitably-large \n\nquarantine facility necessitated the use of a novel approach to test non-target species in Portugal. \n\nWith authorization from the Institute for Conservation of Nature and Biodiversity (ICNB), mature \n\nT. acaciaelongifoliae galls were shipped to Portugal from South Africa to obtain adult female wasps, \n\nwhich were then confined in Petri dishes each with a bud-bearing branch of one of 40 non-target \n\nplant species. The time spent by the wasps exploring and probing the buds was measured and after \n\nthat buds were dissected to detect any egg deposition. Species where eggs were found were then \n\nsubmitted to additional tests. The results showed that T. acaciaelongifoliae did not respond to the \n\nbuds of most (23) species. The females spent time on the buds of the other 17 species but only laid \n\neggs in three species besides A. longifolia. Oviposition on A. melanoxylon was expected but it was \n\nnot anticipated on vines, Vitis vinifera, (where eggs were deposited externally in the pubescent coat \n\nof the buds) or on broom, Cytisus striatus, (where eggs were inserted into the buds the same way \n\nthey are on A. longifolia). Paired-choice with these three non-target species showed that no eggs \n\nwere laid on V. vinifera and that less than two eggs/branch, on average, were laid on C. striatus and \n\nA. melanoxylon. Subsequent trials on potted plants showed that galls only developed on A. longifolia. \n\nField surveys in South Africa and Australia showed that galls never occur on either vines or broom. \n\nThe implications of these findings for biological control of A. longifolia in Portugal with \n\nT. acaciaelongifoliae are considered in relation to the wealth of experience and knowledge about the \n\nspecificity of the wasp and the reliability of conducting host-specificity tests under confined conditions \n\nof cages. A brief overview of the legal procedures needed to secure the release of \n\nT. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal is also presented. \n\nKey words: Acacia longifolia, biocontrol, buds dissection, Europe, invasive plant species, specificity \n\ntests, Sydney golden wattle, Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nAcacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. (Sydney golden wattle, long-leaved wattle) is a small leguminous \n\ntree or shrub, native to south-eastern Australia, which is invasive both in Portugal (Marchante, 2001; \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\nMarchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003) and South Africa (Dennill et al., 1999), as well as other \n\nregions of the globe (Elorza, S\u00e1nchez &amp; Vesperinas, 2004). Some authors (Whibley, 1980) \n\nrecognize two subspecies within this taxon: A. longifolia (Andrews) Willd. subsp. longifolia and \n\nA. longifolia (Andrews) Willd. subsp. sophorae (Labill.) Court., while others treat A. longifolia and \n\nA. sophorae (Labill.) R. Br. as distinct species (Paiva, 1999). Acacia floribunda (Vent.) Willd is \n\nclosely related to A. longifolia, being considered in the past as a subspecies of A. longifolia (Maslin, \n\n2001). \n\nAcacia longifolia was first introduced to Portugal in the late 19th century to curb sand erosion along \n\ncoastal dunes (Neto, 1993). Since then A. longifolia has spread into other areas, both naturally and \n\nby horticulturists who favor its bright yellow flowers (Almeida, 1999; Kull et al., submitted). It grows \n\nrapidly and has prolific production of seeds which accumulate in the soil, reaching average levels of \n\n1500 seeds.m-2 (chapter 3; Marchante, Freitas &amp; Hoffmann, 2010b).The seeds respond to fire and \n\ngerminate en masse in the ash beds (Pieterse &amp; Cairns, 1988). With time, extensive thickets have \n\nformed in coastal sand dunes and a variety of other habitats, particularly along rivers, road edges \n\nand on mountain slopes (Marchante, Freitas &amp; Marchante, 2008). Acacia longifolia is legally \n\nconsidered as an invasive species in Portugal (Minist\u00e9rio do Ambiente, 1999). Its ability to fix \n\nnitrogen (Rodr\u00edguez-Echeverr\u00eda, Cris\u00f3stomo &amp; Freitas, 2007), and the absence of natural enemies, \n\ncontribute to making A. longifolia a highly competitive species capable of shading out native species \n\n(Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, 2003) and posing a substantial threat to local biodiversity \n\n(Marchante, 2001) while changing soil properties and altering ecosystem processes (chapter 3; \n\nMarchante et al., 2008b, a, 2009). \n\nIn Portugal, control of A. longifolia relies on mechanical methods, mainly basal cutting and, to a less \n\nextent, on chemical application of herbicide to the cut ends of the stumps. These methods are \n\nprohibitively expensive and have failed to achieve lasting control (Marchante, Marchante &amp; Freitas, \n\n2004), mostly due to replenishment of thickets from the abundant seed banks in the soil (Marchante, \n\nFreitas &amp; Hoffmann, 2010a). \n\nIn South Africa, where A. longifolia had been problematic for over a hundred years, biological control \n\nwith an Australian gall wasp, Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae Froggatt (Hymenoptera: \n\nPteromalidae), later assisted by a seed-feeding weevil Melanterius ventralis Lea (Coleoptera: \n\nCurculionidae), has proven to be an excellent management option (Dennill, 1988; Impson &amp; Moran, \n\n2003) which is not yet available in Portugal.  \n\nThe first T. acaciaelongifoliae individuals introduced to South Africa, during 1982, were collected in \n\nAustralia from its two known, closely-related hosts, A. longifolia and A. floribunda (Dennill, 1987). \n\n\n\n \n\n142 \n\nSoon after release, it became clear that besides having a direct effect on seed production (Dennill, \n\n1990; Dennill et al., 1999), T. acaciaelongifoliae galls also act as nutrient sinks and thereby indirectly \n\ninhibit the development of both reproductive and vegetative growth of their host plants, often causing \n\ndie back of branches and whole plants when environmental conditions are harsh (Dennill, 1985; \n\nImpson &amp; Moran, 2003). There have been no quantitative surveys to demonstrate the overall \n\neffectiveness of the wasp as a biocontrol agent (Hoffmann et al., 2002) but A. longifolia is generally \n\nno longer considered to be anywhere near as problematic as it was formerly, a change that is \n\nattributed to biological control having succeeded in South Africa. \n\nRecently, consideration has been given to using T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal for biological \n\ncontrol of A. longifolia. The prospects of success are good because the wasp has a proven track \n\nrecord and because it is highly host specific. The specificity of T. acaciaelongifoliae was confirmed \n\nbefore it was released in South Africa by exposing potted plants to the insects under caged \n\nquarantine conditions and subsequently seeking signs of gall development in non-target plants (Van \n\nden Berg, 1980; Dennill, Donnelly &amp; Chown, 1993). Since its release, T. acaciaelongifoliae only \n\nutilizes two of its known Australian host plants, A. longifolia and A. floribunda (Dennill &amp; Donnelly, \n\n1991; McGeoch &amp; Wossler, 2000). Underdeveloped galls are very rarely seen on Paraserianthes \n\nlophantha (Willd.) Nielsen and Acacia melanoxylon R. Br. in South Africa, but only when these plants \n\noccur in close proximity to heavily galled A. longifolia plants and neither of the two species is \n\nconsidered to be a suitable host for the wasp (Dennill, Donnelly &amp; Chown, 1993). The host specificity \n\nof T. acaciaelongifoliae is not unexpected because insects that attack and live within the \n\nreproductive parts of their host plant (especially gall-forming insects) almost always display a high \n\ndegree of monophagy (Ananthakrishnan, 1984).  \n\nAlthough classical biological control has been used against insect pests in Europe (EPPO, 2008), to \n\ndate only one biological control agent (the psyllid, Aphalara itadori Shinji) has been approved to \n\nrelease against an alien invasive plant (Fallopia japonica (Houtt) R. Decr.), which occurred in 2010 \n\n(Sheppard, Shaw &amp; Sforza, 2006; Shaw, Bryner &amp; Tanner, 2009; EPPO, 2010). Despite the \n\nunequivocal body of evidence that T. acaciaelongifoliae is highly host specific (Dennill, Donnelly &amp; \n\nChown, 1993), due to the novelty of the process in Europe, regulatory authorities in Portugal insisted \n\nthat additional evidence should be obtained to confirm that T. acaciaelongifoliae will not inflict any \n\ndamage on non-target hosts, noting that the insects would encounter a distinctive suite of plants in a \n\ndifferent hemisphere.  \n\nThe lack of a suitably-large quarantine facility to perform host specificity tests in potted plants \n\npresented a challenge in determining how the wasps would respond to the plant species on the list \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\nthat was drawn up. This chapter describes the methods that were used, the results that were \n\nobtained and the implications of the findings for deciding whether or not T. acaciaelongifoliae should \n\nbe cleared for release in Portugal. An overview of the legal procedures needed to secure the release \n\nof T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal is also presented. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nBiology of agent and host plant - The biology of T. acaciaelongifoliae has been described by \n\nNoble (1940) and Dennill (1985; 1987). It is a small (ca. 3mm in length), parthenogenic, univoltine \n\nbud-galling wasp that deposits its eggs within the tissues of both reproductive and vegetative buds of \n\nA. longifolia thereby inducing galls which prevent flowering and curb branch growth (Dennill, 1985). \n\nIn the southern hemisphere (including both the native range in Australia and the exotic range in \n\nSouth Africa), T. acaciaelongifoliae adults emerge predominantly in spring and early summer \n\n(October to December/January) and immediately commence oviposition (Dennill, 1987) (Figure 6.1). \n\nA small proportion of adults emerge at other times of the year (N. Dorchin, personal communication). \n\nThe females live for only 2 - 3 days, do not feed and spend most of their time searching for suitable \n\nbuds on which to lay their eggs. Adult females are highly fecund (409 eggs/female in average) and \n\ndisperse readily.  \n\nMonths J F M A M J J A S O N D \nSouth H.

Pictures illustrate the average time \nof occurrence of each phenophase although delays and advances are usually present both within and \namongst populations of different localities. \n\nThe galls develop during spring (late July to beginning of October, in South Hemisphere, when \n\nA. longifolia flowers), in the axils of the phyllodes of A. longifolia. At this stage they are mostly green \n\nand spherical (1-4mm in diameter) (Figure 6.1), being single (one chamber) or in clusters (multi-\n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n\nchambered). As the galls mature they increase in size and by December they are fully developed \n\nreddish green in colour. Once the wasps emerge galls desiccate, shrivel and turn brown. Galls \n\ntypically contain between 1 and 7 chambers (with up to 24 chambers possible), depending on the \n\nnumber of eggs originally laid in the bud. The eggs lie dormant until late winter when they hatch and \n\nmultilocular galls start to develop. Each larva has a discrete chamber in which it completes its \n\ndevelopment. Most chambers contain females but occasional males develop in smaller chambers on \n\nthe periphery of the gall. The sex ratio of females per male averages 5.3:1 (Dennill, 1987). \n\nMilton and Moll (1982) studied the phenology of A. longifolia in South Africa and showed that while \n\nthe timing of events varies with habitat and location, there is active vegetative growth on the plants \n\nfrom September to December (spring and early summer) and then again in autumn (April-May). The \n\nflower buds are set as the new growth forms but flowers only develop between August and \n\nNovember after a period of bud dormancy in winter. Pods develop from September to November and \n\nare fully ripe by mid-November. The period when young buds are suitable for T. acaciaelongifoliae \n\noviposition overlaps with the period when galls are maturing and pods are ripening. In Portugal, the \n\nphenology of A. longifolia also varies in the different regions where the plants occur and shows some \n\nseasonal differences to the southern hemisphere (M. Morais, unpublished data). Usually, first flowers \n\nare observed in December but full bloom is in February - March (late winter through to the beginning \n\nof spring). Pods develop from March to July and ripen between June and August. Small buds         \n\n(1-3 mm) dominate in June-August but are still present in lower numbers until December. Vegetative \n\ngrowth occurs predominantly from April to August (spring and summer) (Morais &amp; Freitas, 2008). \n\nTrees in more northern regions show a slightly delayed cycle. \n\nSpecificity test plant list - The plant species to be included in non-choice tests were selected \n\naccording to criteria outlined by Briese (2002) and Briese and Walker (2002), including phylogenetic \n\nproximity and morphological similarity (specifically bud structure) to A. longifolia. Other factors \n\nconsidered were: economic value, conservation importance (e.g. endemic species), and \n\nbiogeographic and ecological overlap (i.e. plants that are common in sand dunes, the habitat most \n\nfrequently invaded by A. longifolia). The selection included 40 species (Table 6.1) that fulfilled either \n\none (e.g. Quercus faginea Lam.) or several (e.g. Stauracanthus genistoides (Brot.) Samp.) of the \n\nselection criteria. The final plant list was approved independently by ICNB (Portuguese Institute for \n\nNature &amp; Biodiversity Conservation), who had nominated some of the species on the list. The degree \n\nof phylogenetic separation between the listed plants and A. longifolia was established following Judd \n\net al. (1999), mainly to determine higher level of phylogeny (families, orders and major clades).  \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\nTable 6.1 List of plant species tested in non-choice tests with Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, including \nselection criteria for each species.

Muell.; A. cyclops A.Cunn. ex G.Don; A. dealbata Link; \n\nA. decurrens (J.C. Wendl.) Willd.; A. floribunda (Vent.) Willd; A. mearnsii De Wild; A. melanoxylon \n\nand A. saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl.) were subjected to host specificity tests in South Africa where \n\ngalls only developed on A. floribunda, a recognized host plant of T. acaciaelongifoliae in its native \n\nrange, besides A. longifolia. Acacia melanoxylon was included in the tests to confirm the status of \n\ninfrequent observations of sporadic gall formation on this plant species in South Africa. \n\nThe test species were separated into six categories on the basis of their phenology. The groups \n\ncomprised the target invader A. longifolia, and five clades with increasing phylogenetic distance from \n\nthe target (see Figure 6.3), including: 1) species from the genus Acacia; 2) species from other \n\ngenera within the family Fabaceae; 3) species from other families within the Order Fabales namely \n\nPolygalaceae; 4) species from more distant related families within the Rosidae (specifically clade \n\nEurosids I, which includes the Fabaceae), namely Rosaceae, Salicaceae, Rhamnaceae, Ulmaceae, \n\nFagaceae and Myricaceae; and 5) species from distant families outside the Eurosids I. Although \n\nsome authors (Heywood, 1993; Izco et al., 1998) consider the Order Fabales to be monophyletic, \n\nincluding Fabaceae alone, others (Judd et al., 1999) recognize three families in the order, based on \n\nmorphological characters and rbcL sequences, with the Polygalaceae being the only family with \n\nspecies present in Portugal. \n\nThree annual species (Vicia faba L., Pisum sativum L. and Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were included on \n\nthe list even though the wasp needs an entire year to complete its development within its gall, a \n\nmismatch which will preclude this group of plants as possible hosts. The three species where \n\nincluded because they belong to the same family as A. longifolia and due to their importance as \n\ncrops. \n\nHost specificity testing - Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae galls were collected from late \n\nSeptember to December during 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010 on the campus of the University of \n\nCape Town, South Africa (33\u00ba57\u2019S 18\u00ba27\u2019E). For shipment, batches of galls were packaged in sealed \n\npolyester cloth bags inside cardboard containers which were air freighted to Portugal. The packaging \n\nallowed exchange of respiratory gases while ensuring containment of any insects that emerged in \n\ntransit. The galls were received at Escola Superior Agr\u00e1ria de Coimbra (Portugal), where they were \n\nkept in a quarantine facility at approximately 25\u00baC, 12: 12 L: D, conditions which were maintained \n\nbefore and during experiments. Acacia longifolia was collected from several localities in Coimbra \n\n\n\n \n\n147 \n\n(40\u00ba20\u2019N, 8\u00ba40\u2019W) and S. Jacinto Dunes (40\u00ba39\u2019N, 8\u00ba44\u2019W). Branches of test plants were collected in \n\nseveral locations immediately before initiation of the test and were transported with the cut end of the \n\nstem in a container of water to prevent wilting. In the laboratory, shoots with small buds had the cut \n\nend covered with damp tissue paper which was held in place with aluminum foil. \n\nNo-choice tests - The behavior and relative acceptability of all non-target plant species as \n\noviposition sites for T. acaciaelongifoliae was assessed in no-choice tests with A. longifolia as a \n\ncontrol. Each shoot was placed in a Petri dish (5 cm tall, 23 cm diameter) and exposed to one female \n\nwasp for the duration of its adult life (2 to 3 days). Nine branches were tested per species, each with \n\na separate wasp in an individual cage. Whenever possible, each cage contained plants with \n\ncomparable amounts of foliage and numbers of buds (frequently, seven or more buds). Some \n\nexceptions were inevitable due to distinct plant morphology, namely species with high numbers of \n\nsmall buds in close proximity to each other along the shoot (e.g., Erica scoparia L. and Corema \n\nalbum (L.) D. Don) or species with buds widely spaced along the shoot (e.g., Ceratonia siliqua L. and \n\nPinus pinaster Aiton). \n\nPaired-choice tests were conducted in November 2010 to evaluate preference by \n\nT. acaciaelongifoliae females on A. longifolia paired with each of the non-target species where eggs \n\nwere detected in non-choice tests. Tests were conducted in the same Petri dishes as non-choice \n\ntests, for the duration of the females\u2019 adult life. Nine pairs of branches, of equivalent size, were \n\ntested per non-target species. \n\nObservations of the behavior of T. acaciaelongifoliae - Behavior of each wasp was observed \n\nduring nine observation sessions of 1200 s (20 minutes) for each test (including non-choice and \n\npaired-choice). An observation session commenced when the wasp first moved on to a plant or after \n\nfive minutes if this had not happened by then. Over the five years of the trials there were 131 h of \n\nobservations of the wasps. \n\nDissection of buds to detect T. acaciaelongifoliae eggs - After exposure to the female wasps, \n\nbuds of branches used in no-choice and paired-choice tests were characterized according to size \n\n(&lt;1 mm; 1 mm; 1.5 mm; 2 mm; ? 3 mm). In all the branches, from both no-choice and paired-choice \n\ntests, buds were dissected under a binocular microscope to determine the number of \n\nT. acaciaelongifoliae eggs that had been deposited, if any. At least seven buds (exceptionally less in \n\nspecies with fewer buds per mm of shoot) were dissected per branch. Eggs of T. acaciaelongifoliae \n\nare minuscule (approximately 0.2 mm in length), brilliant white and recognizable by their oval to \n\noblanceolate shape (Figure 6.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.2 Acacia longifolia (left) and Vitis vinifera (right) buds dissected to reveal several \nT. acaciaelongifoliae eggs. On A. longifolia buds the eggs were enclosed in bud tissue. On V. vinifera the \neggs were lodged in the protective layer of pubescence that covers the surface of the bud. \n\nGall induction on potted plants - Plant species in which eggs were detected in buds were \n\nsubsequently tested further, except for A. melanoxylon. This species was not included because it \n\nwas particularly difficult to get the small potted plants needed for the experiment and it is already \n\nknown to support gall formation sporadically, i.e., observations in the field in South Africa confirmed \n\nthe result of the oviposition test. For each species, six small (30-90 cm) potted plants were enclosed \n\nseparately in a plastic bag into which two adult T. acaciaelongifoliae females were added and left \n\nuntil they died, corresponding to ca. two days of contact. Wasps were transferred to the potted plant \n\nwithin 14 h of emergence. Two days after all the wasps had died their remains were removed, the \n\nplastic bag was detached and the plants were moved outdoors and monitored for six months to \n\ndetect whether or not there was any gall development. Given that the immature stages are \n\nendopahgous and immobile there was no risk from retaining plants outdoors during this phase of the \n\nlife cycle. The numbers of galls formed, along with their dimensions, were recorded.  \n\nSurveys in South Africa and Australia - When possible, each of the species, or close relatives \n\nthereof, on which eggs were laid in quarantine was surveyed to determine whether the wasps \n\ninduced galls on these species in South Africa and Australia, in the field. In South Africa, plants were \n\nsurveyed in the Western Cape, Cape Region, where A. longifolia used to be very abundant and still \n\nexists at somewhat lower levels. Vitis vinifera L. is widely cultivated in the region and A. melanoxylon \n\nis common but Cytisus striatus (Hill) Rothm is not present at all. Another species of a former Cytisus \n\n(C. monspessulanus L. = Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch.) and the closely related Spartium \n\njunceum L. (spanish broom) were surveyed for galls. For each plant species, sites were selected \n\nwhere the plant species being surveyed was growing in close proximity (&lt;25 m) to A. longifolia \n\nplants with galls. In Australia, plants were surveyed in New South Wales, Wollongong. Acacia \n\n1mm \n\n\n\n \n\n149 \n\nlongifolia, A. melanoxylon, T. monspessulana and V. vinifera were all surveyed but only \n\nA. melanoxylon was found in close proximity to A. longifolia.  \n\nFor each sample, 10 plants of the non-target test species and 10 A. longifolia plants were randomly \n\nselected and observations were made to determine whether the plants had galls by searching for at \n\nleast 15 min. In species where galls were located, 10 branches were randomly selected and the \n\nterminal 70 cm of each was examined to record the number of T. acaciaelongifoliae galls per branch. \n\nThe observations were made during November (2008 and 2009) and March (2009), when the galls \n\nwere completely formed and easy to detect (both during and after emergence of the adult wasps). \n\nStatistical analyses - Time spent on each behavioral element was recorded in seconds and mean \n\nvalues per species were calculated and compared between species using a General Liner Model \n\n(GLM), with a between-subject design One-way ANOVA. The bud dissections were used to calculate \n\nthe percentage of both buds and branches with eggs for each plant species. The quantity of eggs per \n\nbranch was also recorded and compared using One-way ANOVA. In paired-choice tests, the One-\n\nway ANOVA was used to compare, separately, results of each pair of species. In no-choice tests, the \n\nbuds were categorized according to size, and the mean number of eggs laid on each bud category \n\non each plant species, was compared using a GLM with a between-subject design Factorial ANOVA. \n\nDifferences between means were compared with Tukey\u2019s test at 5% level of significance. When \n\nneeded, data were log transformed to fulfill ANOVA assumptions. STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc. \n\n2001, www.statsoft.com) was used for the statistical analysis. \n\nRESULTS \n\nNo-choice tests \u2013 observations of the oviposition behavior of T. acaciaelongifoliae \n\nBehavioral elements did not occur in any particular sequence. Some behavioral elements (\u201cActive on \n\nplant\u201d, \u201cOff plant\u201d and \u201cStationary on plant\u201d) were observed on almost all of the plant species that \n\nwere tested (Table 6.2). The wasps were observed exploring the buds of only 17 species (nine \n\nspecies had wasps stationary on the buds and 12 species had wasps that were active on the buds), \n\nwith no significant differences between species (Table 6.2). Ovipositional probing was noted on the \n\ntarget species A. longifolia and six non-target species, including all the species where eggs were \n\nlater detected. With the exception of A. longifolia, A. melanoxylon and C. striatus, this behavior was \n\nobserved only once on each plant species. \n\n\n\n \n\n150 \n\nWasps were observed on the buds for ca. 3% of the total time of observations on all the plants \n\n(123 h), and spent more time off the plants (ca. 53% of the total time) followed by being stationary on \n\nthe plants (32.5% of the total time). On species where egg deposition was confirmed (Figure 6.3) the \n\nwasps spent more time on the buds, mainly on buds of A. longifolia, A. melanoxylon and C. striatus. \n\nTable 6.2 Time (mean (SE) in sec.), that Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae spent on each behavioral element* \nof each plant species in no-choice tests.  \n\nspecies Off Plant S\nE T\nuk\n\ney\n\nActive on \n\nplant\n\nS\nE T\nuk\n\ney\n\nStationary \n\non plant\n\nS\nE T\nuk\n\ney\n\nActive on \n\nbuds\n\nS\nE T\nuk\n\ney\n\nStationary \n\non bud \n\nS\nE T\nuk\n\ney\n\nProbing\n\nS\nE T\nuk\n\ney\n\nAcacia longifolia 644 (107.1) ab 148.2 (25.4) ab 191.6 (72.8) abc 36.4 (36.4) a 115.4 (68.0) a 64.3 (47.4) a\n\nAcacia melanoxylon 574 (174.5) ab 115.9 (37.8) ab 162.8 (102.5) abc 105.1 (90.8) a 231.1 (119.8) a 10.9 (7.4) a\n\nArbutus unedo 634 (153.4) ab 45.4 (14.1) a 521.0 (148.6) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nCeratonia siliqua 547 (108.9) ab 125.4 (36.6) ab 527.8 (111.1) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nCistus psilosepalus 612 (116.3) ab 236.5 (62.2) ab 351.8 (102.8) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nCitrus sinensis 557 (159.3) ab 168.4 (55.5) ab 475.0 (162.6) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nCorema album 450 (105.3) ab 253.7 (76.6) ab 481.0 (120.4) abc -- -- 15.5 (15.5) a -- --\n\nCytisus striatus 718 (131.8) ab 67.8 (19.7) ab 47.1 (17.6) ab -- -- 270.6 (128.3) a 96.7 (96.7) a\n\nErica scoparia 782 (115.3) ab 121.3 (47.7) ab 254.0 (128.7) abc -- -- -- -- 42.8 (42.8) a\n\nEucalyptus globulus 599 (142.1) ab 131.3 (68.2) ab 470.2 (161.7) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nGenista falcata 821 (158.2) ab 95.5 (43.3) ab 279.2 (121.2) abc 4.7 (4.7) a -- -- -- --\n\nLaurus nobilis 417 (156.8) ab 83.3 (42.3) ab 596.0 (163.8) abc 46.2 (46.2) a -- -- 57.4 (57.4) a\n\nLavandula luisierii 646 (138.3) ab 66.4 (25.5) ab 487.1 (135.2) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nMalus domestica 702 (157.9) ab 280.6 (153.7) ab 118.5 (45.2) abc -- -- 99.0 (99.0) a -- --\n\nMedicago marina 1062 (66.7) b 118.6 (59.5) ab 16.9 (8.4) a 2.1 (2.1) a -- -- -- --\n\nMyrica faya 543 (147.9) ab 58.1 (24.9) a 577.6 (147.5) abc 21.3 (21.3) a -- -- -- --\n\nPhaseolus vulgaris 636 (177.3) ab 69.7 (33.0) a 494.5 (188.4) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nPhillyrea angustifolia 783 (98.1) ab 119.1 (36.3) ab 213.8 (67.4) abc 84.2 (55.3) a -- -- -- --\n\nPinus pinaster 431 (144.7) ab 239.6 (85.6) ab 522.9 (145.3) abc 3.8 (3.8) a 2.3 (2.3) a -- --\n\nPistacia lentiscus 704 (121.7) ab 117.6 (45.7) ab 378.8 (109.0) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nPisum sativum 615 (197.7) ab 214.0 (123.2) ab 371.4 (208.3) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nPolygala vulgaris 904 (168.8) ab 40.1 (20.1) a 255.9 (161.8) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nPrunus lusitanica 925 (64.1) ab 104.7 (24.0) ab 170.2 (52.8) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nPrunus persica 517 (157.8) ab 192.1 (94.6) ab 491.2 (141.3) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nPseudotsuga menziesii 286 (124.5) a 220.5 (69.9) ab 693.8 (143.7) bc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nPyrus communis 1168 (19.2) ab 16.3 (10.0) ab 6.8 (6.8) a 9.0 (9.0) a -- -- -- --\n\nQuercus faginea 394 (135.0) ab 118.4 (35.5) ab 672.0 (137.6) bc 6.3 (6.3) a 6.6 (6.6) a 3.2 (3.2) a\n\nQuercus lusitanica 741 (104.9) ab 55.6 (22.8) ab 403.1 (93.6) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nQuercus pyrenaica 379 (135.6) ab 55.3 (19.9) a 766.2 (137.7) b -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nQuercus robur 654 (106.8) ab 370.5 (108.1) ab 175.4 (75.0) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nQuercus rotundifolia 671 (122.8) ab 109.5 (19.4) ab 420.0 (130.1) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nQuercus suber 625 (131.5) ab 95.6 (24.0) ab 479.4 (125.3) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nQuercus x coutinhoi 773 (109.2) ab 212.0 (77.8) ab 214.7 (70.4) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nRhamnus alaternus 604 (168.6) ab 133.7 (85.6) ab 449.7 (160.8) abc 12.9 (12.9) a -- -- -- --\n\nSalix atrocinerea 586 (104.9) ab 99.3 (33.5) ab 515.3 (100.1) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nStauracanthus genistoides 755 (160.3) ab 160.5 (116.6) ab 284.1 (140.1) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nUlex parviflorus 425 (119.5) ab 142.0 (33.2) ab 558.6 (130.0) abc -- -- 74.3 (54.1) a -- --\n\nUlmus procera 367 (153.5) ab 201.4 (76.7) ab 583.8 (161.1) abc -- -- 47.4 (31.5) a -- --\n\nViburnum tinus 621 (129.4) ab 333.3 (48.1) b 244.7 (95.2) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nVicia faba 469 (175.5) ab 228.8 (101.4) ab 502.1 (155.4) abc -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nVitis vinifera 572 (150.9) ab 63.6 (24.1) ab 544.1 (160.9) abc 17.5 (17.5) a -- -- 2.5 (2.5) a\n\nmean time (sec.) 632.0 (132.2) 142.2 (52.7) 389.5 (118.3) 29.1 (25.5) 95.8 (58.3) 39.7 (36.8)\n\ntotal time (sec.) 25910.4 5829.3 15969.9 349.4 862.2 277.7\n\n% time spent/behaviour* 52.7 11.8 32.5 0.7 1.8 0.6\n\nno. species/behaviour 41.0 41.0 41.0 12.0 9.0 7.0  \n* Active on plant/buds, wasps walking on the branches or leafs/buds with their antennae not in contact with \nthe bud.

Of the nine females placed on \n\neach plant species, seven laid eggs on the target species, A. longifolia, five laid on A. melanoxylon, \n\nfour on C. striatus and two laid eggs on V. vinifera. Eggs were laid on 21.8% of the buds of \n\nC. striatus that were exposed to the wasps while on A. melanoxylon only about 10% of buds had \n\neggs. On V. vinifera only 4.3% of the buds had eggs whereas on A. longifolia eggs were laid in \n\n31.8% of the buds. On C. striatus and A. melanoxylon (which were included in the test-list because \n\nof their close relationship to A. longifolia), eggs were laid within the bud tissues as happens on \n\nA. longifolia. In the case of V. vinifera eggs were laid on the protective, pubescent outer layer of the \n\nbuds and not within the bud tissues. The number of eggs per branch varied with plant species \n\n(F 3,32 = 4.182, p = 0.013), with significantly more eggs laid per branch on A. longifolia than on \n\nV. vinifera and A. melanoxylon while the numbers laid on C. striatus were intermittent between \n\nA. longifolia and the other two species, and not significantly different from any of the others (Figure \n\n6.4). \n\nFigure 6.4 Number of eggs (mean + SE per branch) laid on Acacia longifolia and the three non-target plant \nspecies where eggs were detected (Tukey test, P &lt;0.05). \n\nTrichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae showed a clear \u2018preference\u2019 for laying eggs on buds that were \nsmaller than 3 mm (Figure 6.5).  \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n&lt;1\n\nm m\n\n1\n\nmm\n\n1.5\n\nm m\n\n2\n\nm m\n\n > 3\n\nm m\n\n&lt;1\n\nm m\n\n1\n\nm m\n\n1.5\n\nm m\n\n2\n\nmm\n\n > 3\n\nm m\n\n&lt;1\n\nm m\n\n1\n\nm m\n\n1.5\n\nmm\n\n2\n\nm m\n\n > 3\n\nm m\n\n&lt;1\n\nmm\n\n1\n\nm m\n\n1.5\n\nm m\n\n2\n\nm m\n\n > 3\n\nmm\n\nA. longifolia A. melanoxylon C. s triatus V. vinifera\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nd\n\nis\ns\ne\n\nc\nte\n\nd\n b\n\nu\nd\n\ns\n w\n\nit\nh\n\n e\ng\n\ng\ns\n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 Percentage of different-sized buds that had eggs of Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae on four \ndifferent plant species (n = 9 females exposed on each plant species). \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nA. longifolia C. striatus A. melanoxylon V. vinifera\n\nn\n\u00ba.\n\n e\ng\n\ng\ns\n/ \n\nb\nra\n\nn\nc\n\nh\n\na\n\nb\nab\n\na\n\n\n\n \n\n153 \n\nOn C. striatus most eggs were found in the smallest buds (<1-1.5 mm) while on V. vinifera the eggs \n\nwere found predominantly on larger buds (1.5 - 2 mm).

Three of \n\nthe six potted A. longifolia (i.e., 50%) developed galls in low numbers. One plant had three galls \n\nwhich were 2, 4 and 6 mm in diameter, and the other two plants had one gall each, which were 7 and \n\n9 mm in diameter. No galls developed on either of the other two species. Although the plants were \n\nhealthy when presented to the wasps, some perished during the subsequent monitoring period. \n\nNevertheless, galls were clearly visible within two months of exposure to the wasps and all of the \n\nplants survived for that length of time. \n\nSurveys in South Africa and Australia \n\nIn areas where T. acaciaelongifoliae has open access to the environment, field surveys revealed that \n\nonly A. longifolia had galls of T. acaciaelongifoliae developing on its branches and that galls were \n\n\n\n \n\n156 \n\nmore abundant in South Africa, where the wasp is introduced, than in Australia, the native home of \n\nthe wasps (Figure 6.10). \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nA. longifolia SA A. longifolia A T.monspessulana S. junceum V.   vinifera A. melanoxylon\n\nn\no\n. \ng\na\nlls\n\n/7\n0\n c\n\nm\n b\n\nra\nn\nc\nh\n\nFigure 6.10 The abundance of galls of Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, on the terminal 70 cm of branches, \non five plant species including the target, Acacia longifolia, in South Africa (SA) (Western Cape) and Australia \n(A) (New South Wales).

Non-target species were sampled in SA and A, except for Spartium \njunceum which was only sampled in in SA. \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nEven though international regulations are based on risk analysis schemes (EPPO, 2009a), when \n\ndeciding whether to use biological control as part of a management strategy against invasive alien \n\nplants, the risks of releasing agents must be weighed against the potential costs and benefits, \n\nincluding, critically in this case, whether or not suppression of A. longifolia in Portugal would be \n\npossible and affordable without the intervention of biological control. The impacts of A. longifolia \n\ninvasions on biodiversity and conservation in Portugal are well documented (Marchante et al., 2003, \n\n2004, 2008a,b, 2009; chapter 2). In addition, management interventions practiced thus far have \n\nfailed in the long term because the invader has resurged from accumulated seed banks (chapter 3; \n\nMarchante, Freitas &amp; Hoffmann, 2010a) and financial constraints have frequently prevented follow up \n\ncontrol. Biological control is usually considered as the most cost effective and environmentally-sound \n\nform of weed control (Holden, Fowler &amp; Schroeder, 1992). Based on precedents in South Africa \n\n(Dennill &amp; Donnelly, 1991; Dennill et al., 1999), it is highly likely that, were T. acaciaelongifoliae to be \n\nreleased in Portugal, it would significantly reduce the invasiveness of A. longifolia.  \n\nWhat are the chances that T. acaciaelongifoliae will \u201cattack\u201d non-target species? \n\nIn Petri dishes, T. acaciaelongifoliae laid eggs on buds of three non-target plants. On two of these, \n\nC. striatus and A. melanoxylon (which were included in the test-list because of their close \n\nphylogenetic relationship to A. longifolia), eggs were laid within the bud tissues as happens on \n\nA. longifolia. In the case of V. vinifera eggs were only found on three buds and in each case the eggs \n\n\n\n \n\n157 \n\nwere laid on the protective, pubescent outer layer of the buds and not within the bud tissues, i.e., in a \n\nlocalization inappropriate to induce the development of the gall.  \n\nOviposition on A. melanoxylon was no surprise because, besides being a close relative of \n\nA. longifolia, T. acaciaelongifoliae was observed to probe its buds during host specificity testing in \n\nSouth Africa (Van den Berg, 1980). Besides, the species is known to serve, though very infrequently, \n\nas a \u2018subsidiary\u2019 host for T. acaciaelongifoliae in South Africa, in situations where A. melanoxylon \n\ngrows in close proximity to heavily-galled A. longifolia plants (Dennill &amp; Donnelly, 1991). Of the three \n\nplant species under consideration, the situation with A. melanoxylon is of least concern in the \n\nexercise of considering the introduction of T. acaciaelongifoliae into Portugal, as it has no economic \n\nvalue in Portugal and is currently considered invasive under Portuguese legislation which prohibits \n\nits use and encourages its control (Minist\u00e9rio do Ambiente, 1999). Galling on this species would not \n\nbe problematic and would most likely be infrequent and sporadic if ever. \n\nInfliction of damage by T. acaciaelongifoliae on either C. striatus or V. vinifera would not be \n\nacceptable. Cytisus striatus is a native species in Portugal where it, and several of its congeners, are \n\npopular ornamental plants while V. vinifera has enormous economic value. Oviposition on these two \n\nspecies, and especially V. vinifera, was quite unexpected. A convincing line of evidence that \n\nT. acaciaelongifoliae will not associate with either of these species under natural conditions in \n\nPortugal comes from the trials in which no galls developed on potted plants of either C. striatus or V. \n\nvinifera after exposure to T. acaciaelongifoliae, showing that these species do not meet the \n\nrequirements of the immature stages of the wasps. Additional evidence that V. vinifera will not be \n\naffected by the wasp comes from paired-choice tests (where V. vinifera was rejected) and from field \n\nobservations; in South Africa where many different cultivars of vines are frequently cultivated in close \n\nproximity to galled A. longifolia plants no records have ever been made of galls on the vines, either \n\nhistorically or during the surveys which constituted part of this study. Similarly, several species of \n\nCytisus, and the closely-related Genista, are naturalized in South Africa (Henderson, 1995) and \n\nAustralia (Groves, Boden &amp; Lonsdale, 2005), with some being invasive. They commonly grow in \n\nareas where A. longifolia occurs. In spite of this prolonged association, no T. acaciaelongifoliae galls \n\nhave ever been reported on any of these plants and no galls were encountered during the field \n\nsurveys that formed part of this study.  \n\nFor all the above reasons, the observations of T. acaciaelongifoliae laying eggs on buds of \n\nV. vinifera and C. striatus in Petri dishes were in every likelihood laboratory artifacts, induced by the \n\nconfined conditions and by the lack of suitable host plant material being available to the females. In \n\npaired-choice tests, the wasp never laid eggs on V. vinifera, and both the percentage of buds \n\n\n\n \n\n158 \n\ninfected with eggs and the number of eggs per bud on C. striatus were markedly reduced. \n\nConfinement in cages is well known to disrupt normal behavioral (including olfactory and gustatory) \n\nresponses of herbivorous insects and induces them to develop on a much wider range of plants \n\n(termed the physiological host range) than they would do naturally (Marohasy, 1998; Heard, 2000; \n\nVan Klinken, 2000; Withers, Barton Browne &amp; Stanley, 2000; Sheppard, van Klinken &amp; Heard, 2005). \n\nSuch a situation arose during the early stages of the only other biological control program against an \n\ninvasive plant in Europe. In that case, a psyllid, Aphalara itadori, was being considered as a possible \n\nagent for biological control of Fallopia japonica in the UK (Shaw, Bryner &amp; Tanner, 2009). Despite \n\nthe ambiguous results of laboratory tests, the psyllid was approved for release early in 2010 (Shaw, \n\nBryner &amp; Tanner, 2009). Another example, is the oviposition by Evippe sp. (Lepidoptera: \n\nGelechidae), in cages, on five non-target species (all within the same family as the target weed) with \n\nlittle subsequent larval development (Van Klinken &amp; Heard, 2000). The discrepancy between female \n\nchoice and larval development and survival led Van Klinken and Heard (2000) to conclude that the \n\nmoth would be confined to the target weed in a field situation and should therefore be released as a \n\nbiological control agent.  \n\nParasitism of galls, unsuitable climate and crossing hemispheres \u2013 are there reasons \n\nto be concerned? \n\nBesides the need for assurances that T. acaciaelongifoliae will be restricted to A. longifolia, the \n\npossible acquisition of natural enemies, unsuitable climatic conditions or translocation from the \n\nsouthern to the northern hemisphere may potentially limit its effectiveness in Portugal or even \n\nprevent its establishment altogether. \n\n In South Africa, A. longifolia trees are generally more heavily galled than they are in Australia, where \n\nT. acaciaelongifoliae suffers high levels of parasitism and has to compete with other bud-feeding \n\ninsects (Neser, 1984). This discrepancy persists even though T. acaciaelongifoliae is attacked by \n\nseveral native parasitoid species in South Africa (Hill &amp; Hulley, 1995; Manongi &amp; Hoffmann, 1995; \n\nSeymour &amp; Veldtman, 2010). There is no reason to expect that indigenous hymenopterous \n\nparasitoids will not utilize the larval and pupal stages of T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal (Noyes, \n\n2003) but, because there are no ecological analogues (i.e., gall forming insects on acacias in \n\nPortugal), the impact of parasitoids, both directly on the efficacy of T. acaciaelongifoliae (Paynter et \n\nal., 2010) and indirectly on the local food webs are likely to be trivial. \n\nIn South Africa, T. acaciaelongifoliae is reported to be most effective in warm temperate areas. In \n\nterms of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system (Kottek et al., 2006), these areas are \n\n\n\n \n\n159 \n\ngrouped as Csb (dry summers) and Cfb (humid summers), with a threshold temperature of > 10\u00baC \n\nfor at least four months of the year and a mean temperature for the hottest month of ? 22\u00ba C; i.e., \n\nareas that are climatically similar to areas where T. acaciaelongifoliae was originally collected in \n\nAustralia (Cfb) (Dennill, 1987). Most of the Portuguese coastal region (except for the southern \n\nextremity of the country) and the continental north of Portugal, extending into northwestern Spain is \n\nclassified as Csb (Kottek et al., 2006). In Portugal, A. longifolia is invasive mainly in the coastal \n\nregions, extending to Galicia, Spain, (Elorza, S\u00e1nchez &amp; Vesperinas, 2004), where climatic \n\nconditions would be favorable for the development and survival of T. acaciaelongifoliae. Thus, there \n\nshould be no concerns that climatic-mismatching would dampen the performance of the wasp, were \n\nit to be released in Portugal.  \n\nIn moving T. acaciaelongifoliae from South Africa to Portugal, consideration needs to be given to the \n\nasynchronous phenology of the host plant in the southern and northern hemispheres. Female wasps \n\nmoved from South Africa in October/November when the adults are most abundant will be faced with \n\nhost plants in late-autumn stages in Portugal when most of their buds will be larger than the prefered \n\nsize (>2 mm in length) for egg deposition. Although T. acaciaelongifoliae may select some larger \n\nbuds, at that time of year there would also be some smaller buds on the plants which should enable \n\nthe wasps to establish founder populations. Alternatively, lower numbers of T. acaciaelongifoliae \n\nfemales could be collected in South Africa earlier in the year (N. Dorchin, personal communication) \n\nand shipped to Portugal when the A. longifolia plants would be in a more suitable phenological stage. \n\nEither way, provided enough wasps are released over a sufficiently long period of time, some \n\nfemales should oviposit successfully and produce founding and then burgeoning populations of \n\nadults synchronized with the phenology of A. longifolia in Portugal.  \n\nShould T. acaciaelongifoliae be used as part of a management strategy to control \n\nA. longifolia in Portugal? \n\nAll indications are that there are no substantive reasons not to release T. acaciaelongifoliae in \n\nPortugal and thereby alleviate the overwhelming negative impacts of A. longifolia. The extremely \n\nslight risk that the wasps might lay some eggs on plants other than A. longifolia, the potential indirect \n\nnon-target effects due to parasitoids acquisition, and the minimal consequences thereof, are more \n\nthan offset by the substantial benefits that will accrue if the project succeeds. Biological control is the \n\nonly way to prevent an escalation in levels of irreversible damage that A. longifolia will inevitably \n\ninflict on the ecology and biodiversity of whole communities of native organisms in Portugal, and \n\nfurther afield in Europe.  \n\n\n\n \n\n160 \n\nFurther steps to be taken before release\u2026. \n\nThe release of the wasp T. acaciaelongifoliae is the ultimate goal of the research project and \n\npermissions to do so will have to conform to a series of legal procedures. Any request for release of \n\nan exotic biocontrol agent against an invasive plant species will be the first in Portugal (and only the \n\nsecond in Europe). The regulatory framework to follow is not yet well \u201cestablished\u201d. Nevertheless, \n\nconsidering the framework followed in UK (Djeddour &amp; Shaw, 2010), and which almost certainly will \n\nhave created precedents, the permit to release T. acaciaelongifoliae will have to involve the \n\npreparation of a pest risk analysis (PRA) as this organism is likely to cause injury to a plant \n\n(A. longifolia ) within the PRA area. Part of the information needed to the PRA has been gathered \n\npreviously to support the permission to bring the agent into quarantine. Acacia longifolia is \n\nconsidered naturalized in Spain, France and Italy, though it is only considered invasive in Spain \n\n(Elorza, S\u00e1nchez &amp; Vesperinas, 2004; Celesti-Grapow et al., 2009). Nevertheless, there are other \n\nregions in Europe which have Csb or Cfb climates (Kottek et al., 2006), so the potential for the wasp \n\nto spread across political boarders will need to be addressed in the PRA. PRA will have to be \n\nincluded in an application to Portuguese Institute for Conservation of Nature and Biodiversity (ICNB, \n\nfrom Minist\u00e9rio do Ambiente e do Ordenamento do Territ\u00f3rio - MAOT) with the intention to provide \n\nadequate information for the decision to be made to: 1) free T. acaciaelongifoliae from the \n\nrestrictions of the Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 565/99, under which it is being held, by default once is not listed, \n\nas a \"forbidden non-indigenous species\", and 2) to allow its intentional release in the wild. Possibly, \n\nthe application will have to be reviewed by a Standing Committee, as well as by experts. Other \n\nEuropean Member States (MS), particularly in neighbouring MS and those in the same eco-climatic \n\nzones should be informed of the intention to release and allowed to comment. \n\nAccording to the EPPO decision-support scheme (EPPO, 2009a), the PRA will include a brief \n\ninitiation (stage 1 \u2013 Appendix 6.1) and two major sections that aim to perform a risk assessment \n\n(stage 2 - Appendix 6.2): Section A. categorizes the \u201cpest\u201d and is basically an assessment in the \n\nform of a binary decision tree, constructed from a sequence of questions based largely on decision \n\npoints; and Section B. aims to assess the probability of introduction and spread and of potential \n\neconomic consequences and is a more detailed assessment that will be performed only if the section \n\nA leads to the conclusion that the organism has the characteristics of a quarantine pest.  \n\nThe risk assessment should lead to a conclusion concerning the level of \u201crisk' presented by the \n\nagent, that should inform the decision to continue to phase 3 - the Pest Risk Management (Appendix \n\n6.3) which aims to determine whether the risk is acceptable, and, to identify management options. At \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n\na certain stage, which could be before or during the Pest Risk Management phase, a public \n\nconsultation should take place.  \n\nOnly if all the abovementioned stage result in a positive conclusion would a final approval, from \n\nMAOT be required that will potentially culminate in the agent release. If permission to release is \n\ngranted, contingency and monitoring plans should be in place before release. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nA. Torrinha, J. Maia, C. Morais and V.

Nevertheless, system degradation was striking, \n\nincreasing with time of invasion (chapter 2). Furthermore, invaded systems become highly vulnerable \n\nto reinvasion even if the existing stands of A. longifolia are removed due to the persistent seed-\n\nbanks of A. longifolia (chapter 3). The challenge is to find management options that can be \n\nsustainable in the long-term. Sustainability is particularly important because funding constraints often \n\npreclude continuation of management actions. Therefore, biological control by an agent that targets \n\nthe reduction of A. longifolia seed production, and additionally curtails vegetative growth, can be a \n\nvaluable tool for management, and this was shown to be a promising opportunity for Portugal \n\n(chapter 6). \n\nWHAT HAS CHANGED ON DUNE PLANT COMMUNITIES DUE TO INVASION BY ACACIA \nLONGIFOLIA? \n\nAcacia longifolia is clearly a transformer (sensu Richardson et al. (2000)) drastically changing dune \n\nlandscapes. Changes were detected at several different levels: \n\n\u2022 Dune habitat diversity decreased (i.e., the landscape become more homogeneous); plant \n\ncommunity structure (i.e., physiognomy and vertical stratification) and species traits were markedly \n\naltered; diversity, richness and cover (of species other than A. longifolia) declined. These extensive \n\nchanges are expected to be reflected in changes to ecological webs and ecosystems services.  \n\n\u2022 Soil seed banks, both due to the presence of invader seeds and lack of several native species, \n\nwere altered. \n\n\u2022 Dominance of native plant species post-clearing showed that the system was still resilient, though \n\nresilience capacity decreased, particularly in long-invaded areas, as shown by the lack of some \n\nspecies that are typical of dunes and by the presence of some exotic species (see Box 7.1). \n\n\u2022 Some parameters were more affected than others by duration of invasion, but invasion time really \n\nmade a difference, with the impacts of A. longifolia invasion on plant communities increasing over \n\ntime.  \n\n\n\n \n\n173 \n\nPristine coastal sand dunes in Portugal are characterized by distinct plant communities/habitats with \n\nremarkable floristic and phytocoenotic diversity (Honrado et al., 2006; Silva, 2006) of species that \n\nare naturally adapted to nutrient poor sands and plenty of light at soil level (Smith &amp; Huston, 1989). \n\nSuch communities are becoming increasingly rare with abiotic conditions favourable to their \n\ndevelopment becoming progressively more altered. Changes in vegetation (Marchante, Marchante &amp; \n\nFreitas, 2003; Kutiel, Cohen &amp; Shoshany, 2004; Hellmann et al., 2010), soil functional microbial \n\ndiversity (Marchante et al., 2008a) and chemical parameters (Marchante et al., 2008b) due to \n\ninvasions have already \n\nbeen confirmed for these \n\nand other Mediterranean \n\ndunes. \n\nMost of the findings \n\nrelated with vegetation \n\nwere based on studies \n\nwhich investigated mode-\n\nrate invasion situations \n\nand which invariably, as \n\nfar as we know, were \n\nshort-term and limited to \n\none invasion period. \n\nLong-term studies and \n\nassessments of the \n\neffects of duration of \n\ninvasion are important \n\nthough scarce in invasion \n\necology (Blossey, 1999; \n\nStrayer et al., 2006). \n\nSeveral parts of the \n\npresent study were long-\n\nterm and, while corrobo-\n\nrating some of the earlier \n\nfindings, confirmed the impacts of invasion in areas more-densely inva-ded by A. longifolia. More \n\nimportantly, this investigation showed that duration of invasion is relevant as shown by 1) \n\nAlthough the overall results of recovery in the field confirmed the findings of \nseedling emergence, both experiments provided different information and \ncomplemented each other. Seedling emergence was the only method \nrevealing seeds of A. longifolia in non-invaded areas. Even so, it \napparently augmented the levels of degradation under real field conditions, \noverlooking propagules that migrated from surrounding areas, and missing \nspecies that failed to germinate under greenhouse conditions. Despite \nsuch limitations, seedling emergence can be useful for management as it \nallows a quicker assessment of the ecosystem resilience without major \nclearing efforts. Long-term assessments in field experiments gave a more \ndetailed insight into the recovery potential, which will probably resemble \nmore what will happen after control, but they are more expensive, time-\nconsuming and take longer to provide answers. There was some \ndifferences amongst experiments that allowed further conclusions: \n\n1) Recovery in the field revealed more than twice the number of species \nobserved in the seed bank, with differences in traits that were represented. \nThis was probably due to some stimuli operating in the field (e.g. passage \nthrough animal digestive tracts (Calvi\u00f1o-Cancela, 2004), disturbance \n(Grubb, 1988)), but not in the greenhouse. Furthermore, long-term field \nstudies allowed succession in the germination of species, as was evident \nfrom high turnover rates in conjunction with the immigrating propagules \nthat colonize the gaps created by clearing (Bullock, 2000).  \n\n2) Ephemeral exotic species dominated the recently invaded seed bank \nwhile they were sparse in the field. This was most likely a sampling artifact \n(no. of seedling in the seed banks vs.% plant cover in the field) that \nrequires cautious interpretation of results, e.g. small short-lived exotics, \nsuch as Conyza spp., were highly abundant as seeds but that did not \nnecessarily translated into a high cover in the field. Carpobrotus edulis and \nA. longifolia required a different analysis. Their seeds were fewer \n(A. longifolia) or scarcely found (C. edulis), particularly in long-invaded \nareas. Nevertheless, having vegetative reproduction, like C. edulis (Roiloa \net al., 2009), and forming large individuals (A. longifolia is a tree up to 8 m \nand C. edulis forms large mats) one propagule/seed may create high cover \nin the field. \n\nBox 7.1 Seed banks (chapter 4) and plant recovery in the field \n(chapter 5): did these studies reach the same conclusions? \n\n\n\n \n\n174 \n\nintensification of impacts with time, at vegetation level, 2) impoverishment of seed banks and more \n\ncontamination by the invader seeds in long-invaded areas, and 3) declines in the resilience of the \n\nsystem, with autogenic recovery decreasing as the invasion persists. Six years after removal of the \n\ninvader, despite many native species were present, the vegetation did not fully resembled the \n\nhistorical plant communities (Neto, 1993) in either long-invaded or recently invaded areas. The \n\nexisting stands were actively expanding and showed potential to continue with seeds found several \n\nmeters from the stands and new invasion foci occurring several hundred meters away; such seeds \n\nwere possibly dispersed by periodic strong winds (Bullock and Clarke, 2000), rodents (Holmes, \n\n1990), birds (R. Vaz, SJDNR, personal observation), or other agents. Results further showed that \n\nsome changes take years to become measurable, reinforcing the need for long-term studies (see \n\nBox 7.2), and emphasised that assessment of impacts and recovery potential, including only \n\nparameters expressed by single-measures, can give incomplete pictures of the changes taking place \n\n(see Box 7.3).  \n\nWhen compared with equivalent \n\nstudies on soil Ecology, which looked \n\nat long-term assessments as well as \n\nduration of invasion (Marchante et al., \n\n2008b), this study showed that \n\nvegetation reacts faster to invasion \n\nthan soil. Vegetation of recently \n\ninvaded areas showed marked \n\nchanges while many soil character-\n\nristics in the same areas still closely \n\nresembled native soils. \n\nOnly a few plant species were common to both invaded and non-invaded areas (although seed bank \n\nsimilarity amongst areas was somewhat higher, chapter 4), particularly to long-invaded areas, with \n\nreflection in the plant traits that were dissimilar in the different areas. For example, terophytes and \n\ngeneralist species were more abundant in invaded areas, particularly in recently invaded areas, \n\nprobably as a result of propagule immigration after fire (gap formation), while chamaephytes, \n\ngeophytes and hemicryptophytes - to which many species characteristic of dunes belong - were \n\nalmost absent in the understory of these stands and in the seed bank as well. Some natural sand \n\ndunes lack persistent, extensive seed banks (Owen et al. 2001), partially because perennial species \n\n1) Six years after clearing of A. longifolia some shifts in \nrecovery of species and patterns were obvious, including \nsubstantial increases in the area covered by several native \nshrubs and the invader itself; this was accompanied by a \nreduction in total plant cover (excluding A. longifolia) due to a \nsubstantial decline of some generalist, early coloniser \nspecies, which were especially abundant in plots soon after \nclearing. These shifts would have been missed in a short-\ntime study. \n\n2) Greater changes in recently invaded areas (observed in \nthe five years period), i.e., higher turnover rates, points to an \napparent stabilization of impacts in long-invaded areas (after \na couple of decades). This would also have been missed in a \nshort-time study. \n\nBox 7.2 Methodology (I): were median/long-term \nstudies worthwhile? \n\n\n\n \n\n175 \n\nsometimes have alternative means of reproduction (Sternberg et al. 2003). Nevertheless, \n\ntraits/species characteristic of dunes, that were lacking in the seed bank, were also absent in \n\ninvaded stands, and others were very scarce (possibly close to being excluded) confirming their \n\npossible local exclusion. Even so, this does not imply that those species are extinct at a larger scale, \n\na trend that has been similalrly found in other studies (J\u00e4ger, Kowarik &amp; Tye, 2009).  \n\nImpacts quantified in this study are expected to contribute to complete risk assessments that would \n\nallow, e.g., listing A. longifolia as an European \u201cofficial pest\u201d (Council Directive 2000/29/EC) or \n\nprioritizing management of Conservation Areas invaded by A. longifolia in order to restore their \n\nnatural communities before native species are excluded. \n\nWHY DOES ACACIA LONGIFOLIA HAVE SUCH LARGE IMPACTS IN PLANT DUNE \nCOMMUNITIES? \n\nSeveral characteristics of A. longifolia contribute to the changes observed after invasion, with \n\nenvironmental factors and ecosystem characteristics also contributing to some of the alterations. \n\n1) Acacia longifolia is a prolific seed producer, the seeds are long-lived and despite many being lost \n\nbefore or after entering the seed bank vast numbers still accumulated in the sand dunes (chapter 3), \n\nfrequently exceeding the numbers of seeds of native plant species (chapter 4). Areas invaded for \n\nStudies measuring impacts of invasive species and quantifying recovery after clearing frequently use \nparameters expressed by one single figure, e.g. species richness, plant cover, diversity indexes. These \nparameters are undeniably useful, and as such were also selected in this study. However, alone they may \nconceal relevant information. With this underlying notion a range of other parameters were selected \n(similarity indexes, turnover rates, plant traits and rank abundances curves) aiming to get more insights into \nthe plant communities under comparison. Besides losing some information, some of the single figure \nparameters may lead to \"misinterpretation\" which would be clarified by analysing other parameters. For \nexample:  \n\n 1) similarity index revealed that invaded and non-invaded areas had very distinct species assemblages, with \njust a few species in common, and were in fact more different than suggested by species richness; \n\n2) rank abundances revealed that some species contributing to richness of recently invaded areas were in \nfact very rare and therefore less likely to persist;  \n\n3) species contributing to similarities in species richness and cover through time were not always the same, \nas revealed by high turnover rates;  \n\n4) species traits allowed separation of species with distinct functions in the system (e.g., exotic vs. native; \nephemeral vs. perennial; wind dispersed vs. animal dispersed).  \n\nThese results showed that over and above the advantages of not using single figure parameters, \nuse a multiple range of parameters can also disentangle obscure patterns and trends. \n\nBox 7.3. Methodology (II): was it relevant to analyse diverse vegetation parameters?  \n\n\n\n \n\n176 \n\nlonger time have particularly large accumulations of seeds. The density of A. longifolia seedlings in \n\nthe field (chapter 5), stimulated by clearing operations, were much lower than the density of seeds \n\nobserved in the soil, probably due to the absence of fire which is an important stimulus for \n\ngermination of this species (Pieterse &amp; Cairns, 1986). This means that even after clearing a hidden \n\nlegacy/threat remains in the soil assuring future invasions. \n\n2) Acacia longifolia is a perennial species whose phyllodes decompose slowly (Marchante, 2008) \n\nresulting in the accumulation of a thick litter layer, which increases with time and is much thicker than \n\nthat normally associated with uninvaded dune systems. This litter is richer in N than most of the \n\nnative dune species, promoting changes in soil C and N cycle and fostering additional changes \n\n(Marchante et al., 2008b) which persist after A. longifolia removal (Marchante et al., 2009). The litter \n\nlayer accumulated has major influence in the species that emerge and/or survive. \n\n3) Acacia longifolia, both due to its different physiognomy (i.e., a tree vs. the typical herbs, sub-\n\nshrubs and shrubs) and its high density in dunes, assures that soil coverage is much denser than \n\nthat provided by native dune species, and especially so under the dense canopies of plants in long-\n\ninvaded areas (chapter 2). This is partially explained by the faster growth rates (Peperkorn, Werner \n\n&amp; Beyschlag, 2005) and higher ability to establish interactions with soil mutualists, mainly with \n\nsymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rodr\u00edguez-Echeverr\u00eda et al. 2009), which results in the competitive \n\nadvantage of A. longifolia, particularly when the plants have survived through the seedling stage, \n\n(Werner et al., 2008). Mortality of seedlings was high with few surviving (chapter 5). Its different \n\nphysiognomy facilitated both the profound transformation of the landscape and the difficulty for other \n\nspecies to compete with it (chapter 2). Therefore, not only the invader matters, but its marked \n\ndifference to the species of the recipient ecosystem also contributes to aggravate the level of \n\nimpacts. \n\n4) Being an exotic species, A. longifolia lacks its natural enemies that would normally curtail its \n\nuncontrolled growth. \n\n5) Fire plays a fundamental role in the proliferation of the invasive stands through time by stimulating \n\ngermination of A. longifolia seeds. This was particularly clear in the establishment of recently invaded \n\nstands that quickly proliferated after the summer fire of 1995, reaching more than 60% soil cover in \n\nless than eight years. \n\n\n\n \n\n177 \n\nDO RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TRICHILOGASTER ACACIAELONGIFOLIAE SHOULD BE \nRELEASED IN PORTUGAL? \n\nTests performed in quarantine (chapter 6) and extensive experience in South Africa (Dennill, 1990; \n\nDennill et al., 1999) support the release of T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal (see Box. 7.4 for further \n\nsteps before release). The overwhelming negative impacts of A. longifolia in dune communities \n\n(chapter 2; Marchante et al., 2008b) showed the urgent need for management actions that reduce \n\ninvader density and threat. The results of this study and South African experience show that the \n\nintroduction of T. acaciaelongifoliae has great potential to help to achieve this aim. Recovery studies \n\nindicated that the invaded communities will respond positively to A. longifolia reduction with \n\nappearance of many native plant species though some exotics will also be present and cannot be \n\nignored (chapter 5); this supports T. acaciaelongifoliae introduction. Studies of recovery potential, \n\nsuch as these, are scarce but are essential to anticipate the response of communities after the \n\nintroduction of a biocontrol agent (Denslow &amp; D'Antonio, 2005). There is no real risk of wasps laying \n\neggs on plants other than \n\nA. longifolia (chapter 6) and \n\nany potential indirect non-\n\ntarget effects due to low \n\nlevels of parasitoid \n\nacquisition (Hill &amp; Hulley, \n\n1995; Manongi &amp; Hoffmann, \n\n1995) should be minimal. \n\nFailing to establish due to \n\nchanges of hemisphere or \n\nother environmental unsui-\n\ntability is unlikely. Besides, \n\nany slight side effects will be \n\nmore than offset by the \n\nsubstantial benefits that will \n\naccrue (both ecologically \n\nand economically) if the \n\nintroduction of T. acaciae-\n\nlongifoliae succeeds. \n\n1. Preparation of a pest risk analysis (PRA), because \nT. acaciaelongifoliae is likely to cause injury to a plant (A. \nlongifolia).  \n\n2. Formal application to the Portuguese Authority (ICNB, Minist\u00e9rio do \nAmbiente e do Ordenamento do Territ\u00f3rio), including the PRA and \nasking for:  \na. Remove T. acaciaelongifoliae from the restrictions of Decreto-\nLei n.\u00ba 565/99 \nb. A permit to release T. acaciaelongifoliae in the wild \n\n3. If permission to release is granted, establishment of contingency \nand monitoring plans. \n\nPRA will include (EPPO, 2009): \nStage 1 - a brief Initiation \u2013 introductory section. \nStage 2 - a risk assessment with two major sections:  \n    Section A. categorization of the \u201cpest\u201d (i.e., biocontrol agent in this \ncase) in the form of a binary decision tree \n    Section B. assessment of the probability of spread and potential \neconomic consequences (performed only if the Section A concludes that \nthe organism can be a pest).  \nStage 3 \u2013 a Pest Risk Management to determine if the risk is acceptable \nand to identify management options.  \nBefore or during stage 3, a public consultation should take place. \n \n* based on framework followed in UK, which is likely to have created \nprecedents; more details in chapter 6.  \n\nBox 7.4 Biocontrol further steps to release Trichilogaster \nacaciaelongifoliae*: brief guidelines \n\n\n\n \n\n178 \n\nThe use of T. acaciaelongifoliae should be integrated into a larger management program, e.g. \n\nincluding other control strategies, aimed at restoring the whole system, rather than being developed \n\nseparately (Denslow &amp; D'Antonio, 2005). Before release, realistic integrative goals should be set to \n\nsubsequently evaluate the level of success of the project. Such goals should include both responses \n\nof the community and behaviour of the agent, e.g.: 1) successful establishment of the wasp; 2) \n\nreduction of A. longifolia cover to non problematic levels; 3) major decrease of seed production \n\ninterrupting the continuous seed bank enrichment; 4) recovery/increase of native species diversity, \n\nand, consequently, 5) recover of ecosystem services. Baseline assessments, though scarce, are \n\nessential to compare with future post-release data and quantify the effectiveness of the biocontrol \n\nagent (Harley &amp; Forno, 1992). In this thesis several of these assessments were made (quantification \n\nof annual seed production and resulting seed bank accumulation (chapter 3), A. longifolia and native \n\nspecies cover (chapter 2), responses of the vegetation to A. longifolia removal (chapter 5)) and will \n\nbe valuable for future management. Growth phenology has also been studied for Portugal (Morais et \n\nal., unpublished data) and will be similarly useful. \n\nAs suggested above, when considering invasive plant management (Holden, Fowler &amp; Schroeder, \n\n1992; Murphy &amp; Evans, 2009; Py\u0161ek &amp; Richardson, 2010; Wilson et al., submitted), biological control \n\nmight be the only sustainable, cost effective and environmentally-sound way to prevent the \n\nescalation irreversible damages that A. longifolia will inevitably inflict on the ecology and biodiversity \n\nof whole communities of native organisms in Portugal, and further afield in Europe. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS  \n\n1. Management should not be delayed. Impacts of A. longifolia escalate with time and dispersal \n\npatterns indicate that stands will keep advancing so delaying management will aggravate the \n\nproblem. Management actions should start before the resilience of the system is too low. In areas \n\ninvaded for long time \u201cdoing nothing\u201d may sometimes be the best option, i.e., when restoration is \n\npredicted to be very hard/impossible to achieve. This does not to seem to be the case for the \n\ninvasion by A. longifolia in SJNRD, yet, as many native species were observed slowly (re)colonizing. \n\nHowever, if invaded areas are left, managers need to be aware that more vigorous and probably \n\nmore expensive management efforts will then be needed if the invaded system is to be restored in \n\nthe future. \n\n\n\n \n\n179 \n\n2. Areas and species need to be prioritized: \n\n2.1. New foci of A. longifolia and/ or other exotic species should be targeted for rapid response, i.e., \n\nlocal eradication, control or containment depending on the situation. Seeds of A. longifolia were \n\nfound several meters away from the invaded stands and new invasion foci occur hundreds of meters \n\nfrom the main thickets (chapter 3). These foci are manageable pockets of new invasion and should \n\nbe prioritised for removal (Rejm\u00e1nek &amp; Pitcairn, 2002). The new foci of other invasive plants detected \n\nafter clearing, e.g. Cortaderia selloana, C. edulis and Conyza spp. (chapter 5), should be managed \n\nfirst, or at the same time as A. longifolia, to prevent them becoming a bigger problem after \n\nA. longifolia removal. \n\n2.2. Recently invaded areas have higher prospects of successful recovery (chapter 5) and so should \n\nalso be prioritized for control actions.  \n\n3.  Follow-up control is crucial:  \n\n3.1. Reinvasion by A. longifolia and secondary invasion by other exotic species occurred after \n\nremoval of the invader (chapters 4 and 5). This threat intensifies as the invasion progresses because \n\nA. longifolia seed banks increase, even though many seeds are lost and the remaining loose some \n\nviability with time and become increasingly more dependent on a stimulus to germinate. Acacia \n\nlongifolia saplings in sand dunes can be hand pulled easily when they reach 20 cm \u2013 40 cm, \n\navoiding waste of resources and time to eliminate smaller seedlings that will not survive anyway. \n\nSecondary invasion by C. edulis, particularly in recently invaded areas, C. selloana and Conyza spp. \n\nwas also observed and cannot be ignored.  \n\n3.2. Acacia longifolia seeds were viable for at least six years (chapter 3), but are expected to remain \n\nviable for even more years (Cavanagh, 1980; Daws et al., 2007). As the time to first reproduction is \n\nabout two years, or even less for plants originating from resprouts, after removal of the invader the \n\ncleared area should be monitored, at least annually for six years, to set follow-up (and latter, \n\nmaintenance) control actions in place (Grice, 2009). Moderate fire can be used to deplete the seed \n\nbank (Galatowitsch &amp; Richardson, 2005) and will reduce the duration of follow up control. \n\n4. Non-invaded areas need also to be monitored. Although there was no A. longifolia trees in these \n\nareas, seeds were found in non-invaded areas and may initiate invasions if stimulated by \n\ndisturbance (e.g., fire).  \n\n\n\n \n\n180 \n\n5. Removal of thick litter layers may be beneficial for recovery. Removing the thick litter layers (of \n\nlong-invaded areas) eliminated many seeds of A. longifolia and facilitated the recovery of the areas. \n\nRemoval of thinner litter layers (recently invaded areas) led to loss of species in the seed bank \n\n(chapter 4) and in the field (in 2002, chapter 5), but migrating species propagules compensated for \n\nthat loss. The effort required to remove litter was not very cost-effective, particularly with thinner litter \n\nlayers; moderate prescribed fire can be used to eliminate the thick litter layer and simultaneously \n\ndestroy many seeds of the invasive species (Richardson &amp; Kluge, 2008). \n\n6. Additional restoration measures may be needed to restore native plant communities, particularly in \n\nthe areas invaded for a long time. Although many native species (re) colonised invaded areas after \n\nclearing, including several \n\nspecies characteristic of \n\nthe dunes, many others \n\nwere missing and other \n\nexotic species were \n\npresent. This needs to be \n\nconsidered when planning \n\nrecovery strategies. \n\nAutogenic recovery does \n\nnot seem to be sufficient \n\nto allow full system \n\nrecovery after clearing but \n\nwill make a significant \n\ncontribution (chapter 5). Transplanting of native species should be considered (Galatowitsch &amp; \n\nRichardson, 2005), unless a novel or hybrid ecosystem, with a species assemblage distinct from the \n\nhistoric mixture, is set as a target instead (Hobbs et al., 2006). \n\n7. Biocontrol is a promising and sustainable option to integrate in a complete management program. \n\nRecovery studies showed that the system will react well to A. longifolia removal even though some \n\nother exotics will benefit from the reduction and have to be considered. In this context, and \n\nconsidering the results of specificity testing the introduction of the studied biocontrol agent \u2013 \n\nT. acaciaelongifoliae \u2013 is recommended as it will most likely be the most sustainable option to reduce \n\nA. longifolia to non-problematic levels. A combination of biological control together with initial control \n\nby mechanical methods will probably be the best option.  \n\nIt can be argued that without the introduction of the invasive A. longifolia \n(and other exotics such as C. edulis) sand from dunes would have been \nlost due to erosion, i.e., \u201csand dunes with A. longifolia\u201d are better than \u201cno \nsand dunes at all\u201d.  An alternative could have been to use engineering \nsolutions to stabilise sand, but these are in general very expensive. \n\nMarram grass (Ammophila arenaria), a perennial herb typical from \nPortuguese foredunes, has been used successfully to stabilize sands, both \nin the native range (Schreck Reis, Antunes do Carmo &amp; Freitas, 2008) and \nin exotic ranges (e.g., south-east Australia (Heyligers, 1985) and California \n(Buell, Pickart &amp; Stuart, 1995)). In the exotic range, it has become \ninvasive, probably due to reduction in the abundance of root feeding \nnematodes, amongst other factors (van der Putten et al., 2005). In its \nnative range, even with its growth, longevity and abundance reduced due \nto natural enemies, marram grass is very effective in stabilizing sands and \ncould have been used more proactively. \n\nBox 7.5 Could different management options in the past have \nsolved the erosion problem without introducing A. longifolia? \n\n\n\n \n\n181 \n\nREFERENCES \n\nBlossey, B.
