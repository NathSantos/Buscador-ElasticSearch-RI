Os solos urbanos s\u00e3o \nutilizados durante o desenvolvimento urbano e necessitam de ser geridos para \nserem preservados e deste modo manter o seu papel de suporte e aumentar a \nqualidade de vida. Sendo os solos considerados fontes e acumuladores de \npolui\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 importante desenvolver metodologias para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade \nambiental de solos urbanos como ferramenta de gest\u00e3o sustent\u00e1vel dos \nrecursos.  \nAs zonas urbanas s\u00e3o afectadas por uma enorme variedade de actividades \nantropog\u00e9nicas, sendo as mais importantes o tr\u00e1fego e a ind\u00fastria. Estarreja \u00e9 \numa importante \u00e1rea industrial situada no noroeste de Portugal, estando o \ncomplexo qu\u00edmico localizado apenas aproximadamente a 1 km do centro \nurbano. \nAssim, e de modo a obter uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o geral da \u00e1rea de estudo, foram \nrecolhidas informa\u00e7\u00f5es acerca do clima, topografia, geologia, tipo de solo, \ndados ambientais (emiss\u00f5es para atmosfera, polui\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua, etc.), \nplaneamento local, popula\u00e7\u00e3o, uso do solo e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da ind\u00fastria. Os \npontos de amostragem foram depois seleccionados com base em fotografias \na\u00e9reas, mapas de solo e observa\u00e7\u00e3o no campo. De seguida foram \nseleccionados alguns indicadores da qualidade de solos urbanos, tendo em \nconta que um indicador \u00fatil para uma gest\u00e3o sustent\u00e1vel dos solos deve ser \nsens\u00edvel a mudan\u00e7as na gest\u00e3o. Finalmente, e com ajuda de instrumentos de \nSIG, foi poss\u00edvel obter uma visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o da variabilidade espacial dos \nparametros estudados. O estudo de indicadores de qualidade, aliado \u00e0 \ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o recolhida inicialmente \u00e9 essencial  como  apoio a processos de \ndecis\u00e3o, permitindo uma melhor sustentabilidade na gest\u00e3o dos recursos \nurbanos. Permite ainda uma monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o das mudan\u00e7as na qualidade \nambiental que ocorrem e definir quais as principais fontes de polui\u00e7\u00e3o que \nafectam os centros urbanos. \n  \n \n\n \nv\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nUrban soils; environmental quality; organic contaminants; potential toxic \nmetals; chemical industry; Estarreja. \n \n\nabstract \n \n\nUrban systems represent high turnover of resources, having an effect on the \nenvironment in an unsustainable manner. Urban soils are used during urban \ndevelopment and needs to be managed if it is to be preserved and maintained \nits role in supporting and enhancing the quality of life. Since soil can be \nconsidered both as a source and as a sink of pollution, it is important to \ndevelop and validate a methodology for the assessment of environmental \nquality in urban soils, as a tool for sustainable resource management.  \nThe urban areas are affected by a wide variety of anthropogenic activities, such \nas traffic and industry. Estarreja is a very important industrial area of Northwest \nPortugal, being the chemical complex located near (1 km away) the town \ncentre of the urban area also called Estarreja.  \nTherefore, data about the climate, topography, geology, soil type, other \nenvironmental data (air emissions, water pollution, etc.), local planning, \npopulation (type and distribution), industry characterisation and distribution, \nland use, transports and energy inputs, were collected in order to have a \ngeneral characterization of the study area. The sampling sites were chosen \nbased on aerial photographs, soil maps and field observation.  \nIndicators of urban soil quality were then chosen taking into account that as a \nuseful indicator of land management practices sustainability, a soil parameter \nmust respond sensitively to changes in management. Finally GIS tool were \nused to show spatial variability of contaminant. The main usefulness of this \nstudy is the important information for decision-making, allowing a better \nsustainable resource management in very industrialized urban areas. These \nresults of urban indicators, allied with data collected are essential for \nsustainable urban planning allowing a more efficient management of resources \navailable as well as an effective control of state changes occurring in the \nenvironmental quality of urban ecosystems, particularly in what concerns urban \nsoils. They also allow defining the main causes of pollution affecting urban \nareas. \n\n \n \n \n\n \nvi\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n  \n \n\nvii \n\nContents \nList of Figures .................................................................................................................viii \nList of Tables....................................................................................................................xii \nList of Annexes ...............................................................................................................xiv \n1.

It provides functions as filtering, buffering, \n\ntransformation and storage of contaminants and nutrients, decomposition of organic \n\ncontaminants and groundwater recharge, protection and mineralization (Norra &amp; St\u00fcben, \n\n2003). Nevertheless, these functions are limited and overuse can endanger the environment \n\nand the quality of life, therefore soils must be subject of sustainable urban planning \n\ndevelopment and legislation.  \n\n Human activities are damaging soils and leading to irreversible losses, for that reason, \n\nand as they are a limited resource, soils need to be conserved. Agricultural intensification, \n\nurbanization and industrialization are contributing to erosion, local and diffuse contamination \n\nand sealing of soil surfaces. Pressures on soils, associated to natural factors such as \n\nclimate, have a significant impact on soil chemical, physical and biological characteristics. \n\nThese changes in the environment may modify soil properties, such as pH, electrical \n\nconductivity (EC), organic matter content (OM) or cation exchange capacity (CEC) and \n\ntherefore certain soil functions and the availability of contaminants may also be altered. As a \n\nconsequence soil is degraded, being the main causes: erosion, compactation and crusting, \n\nacidification, salinization and sodification, accumulation of toxic elements and depletion of \n\nnutrients. \n\n Soil protection is normally addressed indirectly through measures to protect water and air, \n\nor developed within a secondary protection. This is mainly due to soils great buffering \n\ncapacities, slow reactions to contaminants and its natural spatial variability. The last one is \n\na specific problem of the soil compartment that makes difficult the distinction between \n\nnatural anomalies and those resulting from human activities (Mol et al., 1998). In this \n\ncontext, it is very important the development of policies that take into account the role of \n\nsoils, the problems arising from the competition among its multiple uses (ecological and \n\nsocio-economical), and that aims towards the maintenance of its multiple functions. \n\nTherefore, a sustainable management of soil as a natural resource, together with air and \n\nwater is a major environmental challenge.  \n\n Urban areas are the geographic focus of resource consumption and chemical emissions. \n\nAs a consequence, urban soils receive a load of contaminants larger than those received in \n\nsurrounding fields due to concentration of anthropogenic activities. Examples of \n\ncontamination sources in urban environment include atmospheric deposition, industry, traffic \n\nand manipulation of pesticides and fertilizers. Contaminants can pass to the food chain by \n\ninhalation, ingestion and dermal contact of dust and particulate matter. Moreover, soil \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 4  \n \n\ncontaminants may be recirculated by re-volatilization, in the water solution or uptaked by \n\nbiota. Such processes contribute to reduce air and water quality and biomagnification of \n\npollutants with consequent decrease in the standard of living, mainly in urban areas. Sealing \n\nand total erosion due to excavation are other factors that are consuming urban soils. These \n\nfactors, allied with an increase in urban population (in European Union is increasing up to \n\n80%) are acting as ecosystems factors leading to new soil properties. Urban systems \n\nrepresent, therefore, a high turnover of resources, having an effect on the environment in an \n\nunsustainable manner.  \n\nSince soil can be considered both as a source and as a sink of pollution, it is important to \n\ndevelop and validate a methodology for the assessment of environmental quality in urban \n\nsoils, as a tool for sustainable resource management. An urban planning together with an \n\nefficient use of urban areas and re-utilization and recycling of abandoned areas can be \n\nimportant in sustainable development of cities. Therefore, and considering urban \n\nenvironment degradation, it is fundamental and urgent to develop comparable and \n\nreproducible methodologies of soil quality assessment in urban settings.  \n\nThe purpose of this work is to study the geochemistry and environmental quality of urban \n\nsoils. As a case study it was chosen Estarreja, a small city from northwest Portugal, \n\nnotorious for its chemical industry. For the quality assessment of urban soils from Estarreja, \n\ndata about the climate, topography, geology, soil type and other environmental data \n\n(atmospheric emissions, water pollution, etc.), were collected in order to have a general \n\ncharacterization of the study area. Socio-economic indicators were also collected, as \n\nthese are driving forces for the formation of a city as environment. A general \n\ncharacterization of soils was first performed followed by the study of more specific indicators \n\nsuch as levels of potentially toxic metals and organic contaminants. Basic and multivariate \n\nstatistical procedures and GIS tools were used to identify sources of pollution and \n\ndiscriminate natural and anthropogenic contributions as well as point sources of \n\ncontamination. In conclusion, this study aims at identifying possible sources of contamination \n\n(industry, agriculture or the urban area), assessing the suitability of soil to its use and to \n\ncontribute for land use planning in accordance to soil characteristics. To better understand \n\nthe study a description of the adopted methodology was previously made. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 5 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2. Proposed methodology to evaluate soil quality: a tool \nfor urban resource management \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 6  \n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 7 \n \n\n2.1. Urban soils issues \nAccording to the European Community (EC, 2004) soils of urban areas have specific benefits \n\nand dis-benefits for quality of live spectra such as health, social, economical, technical and \n\nenvironmental qualities. These soils are defined as soils which occur within the boundary of \n\nan urban community and they include natural, man-modified and man-made soils. These last \n\ntwo types may occur outside the urban communities.  \n\n Urban soil is used during urban development and it needs to be managed in order to \n\npreserve and maintain its role of supporting and enhancing quality of life. The main functions \n\nof an urban soil are: the support of infra-structures, recreation/landscaping/leisure, \n\npreservation of air and water quality, life support (ecological), natural heritage, health cost \n\nreduction and heat balance. However, sealing soils, more than losing soils for agricultural \n\nand forestry, will limit ecological functions of soil, such as storage of carbon or habitat for \n\nunique biota. Indirect effects may be the fragmentation of habitats and disrupt of \n\necological corridors. Moreover, water runoff may increase, resulting in a higher risk of \n\nfloods. Other problem is the accumulation of contaminants in urban soils that not only \n\ndegrades soil quality but can also pose a health risk to humans and the ecosystem (Wong et \n\nal., 2004). For example, in areas where public gardens and parks are exposed to \n\nsignificant pollution levels, dust from ground may have toxic effects as a consequence of \n\ninhalation or ingestion by humans, particularly children (Manta et al., 2002).  \n\nThe knowledge about processes of urban soil genesis and the role of soil in urban \n\necosystems is essential for environmental-impact assessments due to the fact that soil is \n\nan important source and sink of contaminants. Urban soils development does not only \n\ndepend of natural factors as in natural areas, but also of the socio-economical processes, \n\nincluding planning that can become sometimes predominant factors. The genesis of urban \n\nsoils is based on conditions that are not found in natural or agricultural systems. During \n\nurban development soils are damaged and modified especially by land use changes and \n\nengineering requirements and original soils are often buried, removed, compacted and \n\ncontaminated. Sometimes local urban soil is replaced by foreign soil of inferior quality. In \n\nsome cases these soils consist of slags, ashes, waste, building rubble, tar, sludge, etc, or \n\nmixed with natural substances. Other peculiar characteristics of urban soils are the \n\nunpredictable layering, poor structure and high concentrations of trace elements (Manta et \n\nal., 2002). Therefore, hydrology, degree of sealing and compressing may differ from \n\nnatural soils. An important issue related to urban areas is the diffuse pollution, being the \n\nmain causes the combustion processes, the waste disposal from traffic, households and \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 8  \n \n\nindustry, changes in land use type and intensity, the precipitation, the air temperature, \n\nhumidity and soil parent material (Norra &amp; St\u00fcben 2003). As a consequence of all these \n\nspecific characteristics, urban soils have specific soil chemistry, being the main factors \n\nresponsible for the pattern: atmospheric deposition, waste disposal, construction activities, \n\ncoal burning waste and sealing (Manta et al., 2002; Norra &amp; St\u00fcben, 2003). Furthermore, \n\nin an urban environment it is possible to classify different land uses according to its \n\ninfluence such as traffic, industrial, commercial, disposal sites, cemeteries, housing and \n\nparks.  \n\n \n\n2.2. General characterization of urban ecosystems: data collection \nA comprehensive preliminary characterization of the ecosystem is essential to define the \n\nset of soil properties to be assessed, in order to provide a suitable soil quality assessment \n\nof the urban area. It will also allow defining the criteria for selection of sampling sites and \n\nestablish sampling and analytical procedures.  \n\n The main objective of data collection is to characterise the urban ecosystems by \n\ngathering all the available information about land use management. General data about \n\nclimate, topography, geology, soil type and specific environmental data (such as \n\natmospheric emissions and water pollution), are collected in order to have a general \n\ncharacterization of the study area. A socio-economic characterisation of the city is also \n\nimportant as some pressures on soil consumption may be socio-economic factors such as \n\nthe high dependence of gross national income from land consumption (EC, 2004). Most of \n\nour modern social economic activities depend on the construction, maintenance and \n\nexistence of sealed areas. Housing, mobility and communication, supply with goods and \n\nservices, security, health, traditional construction and urban architecture demand sealing are \n\nalso factors that will influence the soil use (EC, 2004). This way, it should be collected \n\ninformation about urban planning, population (type and distribution), industry typology and \n\ndistribution, land use, transports and energy inputs. Therefore, and in order to perform a \n\ncomprehensive assessment of the soil quality of an urban ecosystem, the following \n\nfeatures should be considered: \n\n\u2022 History: age of the city, traditional occupations, resources available through time, \nhistorical development, historical parks, historical buildings and infra-structures, \n\narchaeological sites, planning models used over time, historical industrial \n\ndevelopment; \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 9 \n \n\n\u2022 Demography and socio-economic indicators: size of the city, population \ndensity, evolution of resident population, employment and health statistics, \n\neducation degree statistics, housing conditions, gross domestic product, degree of \n\ntechnological development, types of industry and commercial services; \n\n\u2022 Land use: historic land use, present and planned land use, land use density, \nregulatory framework of territorial planning, percentage of sealed and urbanised \n\nland, percentage of forest, urban agricultural and green areas, percentage of \n\nderelict land, delimitation of the urban area, delimitation and area of the city centre, \n\ntransport patterns and traffic intensity; \n\n\u2022 Natural conditions: available natural resources, flood areas, topography and \nslope, ground stability, groundwater resources and hydrological features, geology \n\n(bedrock and soil types), biodiversity and protected habitats, species of special \n\ninterest; \n\n\u2022 Climate: temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed and direction, cloud \ncover, solar radiation; \n\n\u2022 Pollution sources: characterisation of main driving forces for physical, chemical \nand microbiological pollution and their emissions \u2013 industrial, commercial, \n\nhousehold, agricultural and gardening, waste management, traffic, construction, \n\ntourism and energy sectors; historical data on point and diffuse sources. \n\n \n\n In conclusion, data collection in preliminary assessments of urban soil quality should \n\nallow: to define and characterise elements and components of the urban ecosystem under \n\nstudy; define patterns of soil uses; a preliminary evaluation of soil functions and of \n\nchanges in natural features and their spatial distribution; identify natural habitats of special \n\nimportance, potentially contaminated sites and potentially toxic elements and substances.  \n\n \n\n2.3.  Sampling strategy and sample preparation of urban soils \nSampling and sample preparation procedures for the investigation of soils are regarded as \n\nthe first and most important step towards a more comparable and reproducible analysis of \n\nsoil (Wagner et al., 2001), and must to be planned in accordance with the objectives of the \n\nstudy. In fact, when performing a sampling plan one has to keep in mind that the major \n\nobjective of sampling is to be representative and that sampling and sample pre-treatment \n\nshall be \u201cfit-for-purpose\u201d (Barbizzi et al., 2004; Kurfu ?rst et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 10  \n \n\n Regarding urban soils, the level and spatial pattern of soil quality parameters need to \n\nbe taken into account, and characterising this variability is an essential step, even though \n\nvery complex, for an environmental survey. Therefore, the preparation of a sampling plan \n\nthat include the sampling design for assessing soil quality/ contamination is a key step on \n\nthe whole process as samples should be truly representative.  \n\n In what concerns to soil sampling there are some important issues that should be \n\naddressed: a) how methodologies might affect data quality; b) the sources of deviation or \n\nuncertainties; c) the comparability and representativeness of soil sampling or the sampling \n\nguidelines that are not harmonised (Theocharopoulos et al., 2001). The usual geostatistical \n\ndata treatment assumes a precise protocol for sampling as well as mapping of sampling \n\nsites. It requires also a minimum number of field measurements and analytical \n\ndeterminations to enable useful interpretation of the results. However, in the case of urban \n\nsoils it is not always possible to collect a number of samples enough for the geostatistical \n\nanalysis; besides, the choice of sampling sites is usually restricted to the available land (not \n\nsealed) and public areas. \n\n A preliminary sampling strategy should be defined, by choosing potential sampling sites, \n\nbased on interpretation of available documents such as maps, aerial photographs, satellite \n\nimages and also on field observations. All information collected about the urban \n\necosystem should also be taken in consideration when defining the potential sites for \n\nsampling. An important question that should be answered before the sampling campaign \n\nstarts is sampling density in urban area. It is important to have representative samples of \n\ndifferent land uses, covering all the urban area. The land uses to be sampled should also \n\nbe previously selected and they may include: ornamental gardens (OG), parks (PO), \n\nroadsides (RD), riverbanks (RB), kindergartens (KT), agricultural (AG) and railway sides \n\n(RL).  \n\n The sampling plan should also include a detailed scheme with instructions for \n\nsampling, pre-treatment and storage of samples. A sampling protocol should be \n\nestablished well in advance before the sampling starts and it should include the sampling \n\nequipment (corers, augers), quantity of sample to collect, cleaning of samplers and \n\ncontainers to hold the samples (depending on the parameter to analyse, e.g. inorganic vs. \n\norganic compounds). It should also include all the processing steps after sampling: when \n\nand how the samples will be transported to the lab; contamination controls procedures; \n\nsamples pre-treatment and samples storage. It is also important to have a list of material \n\nneeded for sampling and to define previously how each sample will be labelled, with a \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 11 \n \n\nunique sample code. A field data inventory should be also completed in the field, including \n\ninformation helpful when evaluating the results: a detailed description of the sampling \n\narea, including the site location/ age and land use considerations such as description of \n\nthe surroundings, traffic intensity and possible contamination sources. \n\n In conclusion, the main objectives when defining the sampling plan are the selection of \n\nsites to collect urban soil samples and how it will be performed the collection of samples. \n\nThe first one includes the definition of sampling regimes (classes of urban soil to be \n\nconsidered) and the establishment of a sampling strategy (sampling sites/points carefully \n\ndefined and the sampling design defined). Once again, the sampling plan will be \n\ndependent on the objectives of the study and materials and methods used for sampling, \n\nstorage and analysis can not interfere with the analyte and/or matrix.  \n\n \n\n2.4. Definition and assessment of general indicators of urban soils quality \nDefining soil quality in objective terms is very difficult as the concept is diffuse and it must \n\nreflect a range of social, cultural and economic factors as well as biophysical properties. \n\nKarlen et al. (1997), defined soil quality as 'the capacity of a specific kind of soil to \n\nfunction, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal \n\nproductivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human health and \n\nhabitation'.  \n\n However, many other definitions of soil quality can be found (Diack &amp; Stott, 2001): \n\na) \u201cDegree of suitability to the specific functions that soils perform in a given system\u201d.  \n\nb) \u201cThe capacity of the soil to promote the growth of plants; protect the watersheds by \n\nregulating infiltration and partitioning of precipitation; and prevent water and air pollution \n\nby buffering potential pollutants\u201d (US National Research Council definition).  \n\n \n\n The difficulty in establishing only one definition comes from the variety of land uses, \n\nlocation, environments, types of soils and a general lack of understanding between the \n\ninteractions of processes occurring within soil.  \n\n Soil quality requirements will be dependent of the application considered. For example, \n\nrequirements for general purposes are basic requirements regarding plant nutrients, salt \n\ncontent, swell and shrink behaviour on wetting and drying, rewettability of the soil \n\n(hydrophobic behaviour), homogeneity of the soil material and soil pollution (Huinink, \n\n1998). In urban soils the requirements may have to be adopted for applications such as \n\nornamental planting, ornamental trees, herbaceous grass, road verges or construction. In \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 12  \n \n\naddition, although there are many indicators that reflect the current capacity of the soil to \n\nfunction, there are only a few that can predict the capacity of the soil to support a range of \n\ndisturbance regimes. Moreover, soil quality cannot be measured directly from soil alone \n\nbut inferred from soil characteristics and behaviour under specific conditions.  \n\n According to Diack &amp; Stott (2001) there are two approaches to quantify soil quality: \n\ndescriptive and indicative. The first one is concerned with the characterization of different \n\nattributes of quality and the second one with the identification of specific indicators or \n\nparameters that will assess the ability or capacity of an attribute to function in a desired \n\nmanner. The objective is to identify and measure specific indicators to better define urban \n\nsoil quality.  \n\n According to European Environmental Agency (EEA, 2005), an indicator is a measure, \n\nusually quantitative, that can be used to illustrate and communicate complex phenomena \n\nsimply, including trends and progress over time. It provides a clue to a matter of larger \n\nsignificance or makes perceptible a trend or phenomenon that is not immediately \n\ndetectable. Indicators should be chosen taking into account that as a useful indicator of \n\nthe sustainability of land management practices, a soil parameter must respond \n\nsensitively to changes in management (Doran &amp; Parkin, 1996). When characterizing soil \n\nquality over a short-time period, critical properties must also be sensitive to changes in \n\nsoil disturbances and inputs into soil system (Diack &amp; Stott, 2001). Moreover, methods to \n\nquantify soil quality must assess changes in selected soil attributes over time, but not \n\nchanges influenced by short-term weather patterns. Soils and their indicator values vary \n\nbecause of differences in parent material, climatic conditions, topographic or landscape \n\nposition, soil organisms, and type of vegetation. Interpreting indicator measurements to \n\nseparate soil quality trends from periodic or random changes is a major challenge for \n\nresearchers and soil managers.  \n\n Assessment of soil quality requires the definition of key indicators based on information \n\ncollected in the initial assessment, according to city-specific situations, type of soil use \n\nand scope of the study. This choice should be made before preparing the sampling plan. \n\nIn this study, a general characterization of soils has made, including pH, cation exchange \n\ncapacity (CEC) and exchangeable bases, particle size distribution (clay, silt, sand), \n\nelemental analysis (CNHS) and organic matter. More specific analysis, to evaluate the \n\nextent and the main sources of pollution, include potentially toxic metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, \n\nCu, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Hg) and organic compounds (PAHs, PCBs). Other parameters can be \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 13 \n \n\nmeasured, however this will depend on pollution sources known and available analytical \n\ncapabilities. \n\n After deciding which indicators will be analysed, analytical methods are chosen and \n\nQC/QA and assessment procedures for the analytical methods adopted and implemented. \n\nAnalytical methods should be selected among those already available for soil quality, i.e. \n\nnational and internationally accepted methods. Whenever possible standardized methods, \n\ne.g. ISO or EPA, should be chosen. Nevertheless, new or adapted methods may be \n\ndevised to adequately meet the particular situation of the urban soils.  \n\n \n\n2.5. Data reporting using statistics and GIS tools \nFor data reporting purposes, statistics and GIS tools may be used. The use of descriptive \n\nstatistics and bivariate analysis allow the structural description of the input data. The one-\n\ndimensional analysis can be considered as a useful tool for exploratory analysis of data \n\nand general characterisation of the studied variables. For the graphical representation of \n\ndata histograms and box-plots may be used, as they are the easiest way of highlighting \n\nthe type of distribution of frequencies and the existence of outliers. By using bivariated \n\nanalysis (e.g. Pearson\u2019s correlation) it is possible to understand how the variables are \n\nrelated, by finding correlations between pairs of parameters and therefore assess the \n\nnature and strength of covariation between factors.  \n\n As in most of the environmental studies, each site is characterized by multivariate data \n\nsets and the application of multivariate statistics to quality assessment of urban soils is of \n\ngreat importance, since it is able to consider several variables simultaneously and \n\ntherefore allows interpretations that are not possible with univariate statistics. Principal \n\nComponent Analysis (PCA) is a method that depends on the mathematical extraction of \n\neigenvectors and eigenvalues from a matrix of sample resemblance values (normally \n\nPerson correlation values). Using matrix algebra, PCA extracts from the matrix of \n\ncorrelation coefficients a series of equations (components) which summarise the \n\nrelationships between variables and account for the variation present in the matrix. These \n\nequations, or principal components, are used to calculate unique sample scores, which \n\ncan be plotted to produce an ordination diagram (Waite, 2000). The aim is to reduce the \n\ndimension of spaces, or to represent the complexity of relationships between variables in \n\nthe minimum number of dimensions, being the main advantage the identification of \n\nassociations between variables.  \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 14 \n\nGeographic Information System (GIS) is a collection of computer hardware, software, \n\nand geographic data for capturing, managing, analyzing, and displaying all forms of \n\ngeographically referenced information (ESRI - [w1]). The computer system allows \n\nmanaging spatial data that is organized to yield useful knowledge, often as coloured maps \n\nand images, but also as statistical graphics, tables, and various on-screen responses to \n\ninteractive queries. It implies that location of the data items are known in terms of \n\ngeographic coordinates (latitude, longitude). Thus, GIS have functional capabilities for \n\ndata capture, input, manipulation, transformation, visualization, combination, query, \n\nanalysis, modelling and output (AWI - [w2]). GIS can integrate and relate any data with a \n\nspatial component, regardless of the source of the data (Figure 2.1).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Principles of GIS function, how it can integrate and relate data with a spatial \ncomponent (ESRI- [w1]). \n\n \nThe geographic information systems (GIS) are very useful in urban soils to show \n\nspatial variability of contaminants, being an easy way to identify, for e.g., sites exceeding \n\nthe risk-based standards. With these tools, areas of potential or actual risk and areas \n\nwere it is needed some kind of intervention can be identified. The analysis of the results \n\nobtained, compared with soil and land use (past and present) may lead to the \n\nidentification of the main sources of pollution and degradation in the cities (former and \n\npresent). Therefore, soil maps are important information for decision-making and can be \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 15 \n \n\nused for regulation purposes by Local Authorities since they show basic information for \n\nsoil conservation and sustainable urban development (Norra &amp; St\u00fcben, 2003). \n\n \n\n2.6. The importance of Quality Control/ Quality Assurance (QC/QA) in \nquality assessment of urban soils \n\u201cQuality control is the set of procedures used to measure and, when necessary, to correct \n\ndata quality. Quality assurance is the set of procedures used to provide documentary \n\nassurance of the proper application of quality control and the resulting data quality\u201d \n\n(Environment Canada, 2001). Quality assurance and quality control refer not only to the \n\ndetermination step but to all the steps of the analytical process, which in the case of soil \n\nquality studies can be considered as follows: definition of soil quality study, soil sampling, \n\nsoil sample pre-treatment and storage, soil sample analysis, data reporting, conclusions \n\nand recommendations. Moreover, consistency in analysis can only be achieved if there is \n\nuniformity in procedures and nomenclature of all the steps mentioned (NEPC, 1999). The \n\ntotal uncertainty associated to the final results is, therefore, a sum of different \n\ncontributions coming from the different steps of an analytical method: sampling, storage, \n\ntreatment, analysis and data reporting. \n\n The analysis itself can be nowadays considered under control or can be put under \n\ncontrol following adequate precautions, due to the high performances of instrumental \n\napparatus. Data treatment tends to be neglected as a QC/QA procedure, but it can also \n\nbe a source of errors and therefore it should be under a strict control.  \n\n To control sample treatment QC/QA considerations should be integrated on the \n\ndefinition of the methodology, in order to assure representativeness and reliability of the \n\nresults obtained. Standardized analytical methods (ISO methods) should be used \n\nwhenever possible. Apart of this, the methods should be validated and quality of data \n\nassured by quality control measures. The QC/QA procedures includes the use of method \n\nblanks, that means processing the solvents and reagents in exactly the same way as \n\nsamples giving the analytical signal that is not derived from the sample but from reagents, \n\nglassware, laboratory environment, etc. As a measure of accuracy, analysis of certified \n\nreference materials (CRM) should be implemented, especially of those provided by the \n\nInstitute of Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, formerly BCR). They allow an \n\nevaluation of the performance of the overall analytical method (excluding sampling) rather \n\nthan an evaluation of the extraction efficiency only. As CRM available are not always \n\nequal to the sample analysed (different matrix, different compounds and concentrations) \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 16  \n \n\nmatrix fortified with analytes representative of the analyte class should also be used; \n\nhowever these spiking experiments can lead to an overestimation of the real extraction \n\nefficiency. Recoveries should be then checked and the results can be corrected or not for \n\nrecovery. Quality control charts should be implemented as a tool for internal quality \n\ncontrol. Variation between replicate analyses should be recorded for each process batch \n\nto provide an estimate of the precision of the method. \n\n Sampling remains far from being under control, being this probably the single largest \n\ncomponent affecting the value of any chemical measurement. Therefore a good analytical \n\nprotocol must include sampling strategies free of contamination and loss and proper \n\nstorage and stabilization of the samples, which is especially important when dealing with \n\ntrace analysis. Other key issues regarding the QC/QA of results are, the \n\nrepresentativeness of samples collected and the preparation of a precise sampling plan \n\nthat is crucial to minimize the uncertainties associated to this step of the study.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 17 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3.

Characterisation of the Estarreja urban ecosystem \n3.2.1 Climate \nDespite its relatively small extension, Portugal has a climate that varies significantly \n\namong regions and places. The main causes of this variation are the latitude, the distance \n\nto the sea and, for the regions of the coastal zone, the predominant orientation of the \n\nshoreline. Estarreja region is characterised by a warm climate with wet and dry seasons. \n\nA brief description is presented below (Instituto Meteorol\u00f3gico - [w3]: \n\n \n\u2022 Average annual humidity: values ranging from 79 to 88 %; the humidity results \n\nfrom the permanent evaporation verified in Ria and there is also a contribution of \n\nthe humidity brought by summer breezes influenced by the Gulf Current. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 21 \n \n\n\u2022 Average annual temperature: values ranging from 14.1 to 15.0 \u00baC; the lowest \nmean temperature range in winter is from 6.1 to 7.0 \u00baC and the range of the mean \n\nhighest temperatures is from 22.1 to 23.0 \u00baC. \n\n\u2022 Average annual precipitation: values ranging from 1201 to 1400 mm; the range \nof the mean values for winter is from 401 to 600 mm, while for summer is from 61 \n\nto 100 mm. \n\n\u2022 Predominance of winds: from Northwest (NW) and North (N); in autumn, the \npredominance of NW diminishes, while increasing, gradually, the influence of the \n\nwinds of SE and S. \n\n\u2022 Solar radiation/ hours of insolation: from 110 hours in December to 320 hours \nin July; the total annual is from 2601 to 2700 hours. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Geology and soil type \nRegarding geology, Estarreja is located in the Aveiro\u00b4s sedimentary basin. This basin is \n\nconstituted by Quaternary units consisting of alluvium, sand dunes, old beach and terrace \n\ndeposits that occur regionally as a superficial layer or as layers of variable thickness \n\n(maximum thickness is 25 to 30 m). The Modern Deposits are a system of beaches and \n\nfluvial terraces in steps, of detritic nature and granolumetries from fine to coarse (Barradas, \n\n1992; Azevedo, 1999). They are represented by modern alluvions that form the littoral \n\nregions and sand dunes, being the last ones very significant all over the littoral extending to \n\ninterior. This sedimentary basin is, in the north-eastern edge of the basin where Estarreja \n\nis located, only a dozen meters thick but as the structure plunges to the west, it may attain \n\nseveral tenths of meters (Costa &amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001). Concluding, three lithological units \n\nmay be individualised in this Quaternary formation: \n\n- the upper unit, composed of dune sands and alluvium silt-clayey sands, covered \n\nby organic topsoil; \n\n-  the intermediate unit, very heterogeneous, with irregular geometry, due to sudden \n\nvertical and horizontal geologic variations; \n\n- the lower unit formed by loose conglomerates. \n\n The Quaternary deposits overlay the bedrock, constituted by Paleozoic and \n\nPrecambrian rocks in the north, or the Cretaceous formations in the rest of the region as \n\nshown in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.4 shows the detailed geology of Estarreja region in a scale \n\nof 1:50.000. \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 22 \n\n0 6,800 13,600 20,400 27,2003,400\nMeters\n\n0 6,800 13,600 20,400 27,2003,400\nMeters\n\n \nFigure 3.3 - Geology of the lower Vouga sedimentary basin, 1:25000 (from Carta Geol\u00f3gica \nde Portugal, 1972). \n\n \n Soils in the area under study are mainly podzols, mainly found in sand dunes and low \n\nterraces (5-8 m), yet Cambisols can also be found (Ferreira, 1993; Azevedo, 1999). The \n\nhorizons of these soils are well defined and it\u2019s important to note the existence of the B \n\nilluvial horizon (darker than adjacent ones due to accumulation of organic matter and \n\nsesquioxides) and the E elluvial (strongly lixiviated). The normal profile of a podzol has the \n\nhorizons O-A-E-BHs-Bs-C.  \n\n Podzols, according to the Portuguese classification, are divided in two sub-orders: \n\nhydromorphic (Haplic) and not hydromorphic (Gleyic). The families more represented in \n\nthe study area, are differentiated by the original material and by the cementation grade of \n\nHorizon B as follows (Azevedo, 1999): \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 23\n\n- Pz \u2013 Podzols not hydromorphic without \u201cFe/Al pan\u201d, of sands (Gleyic podzols) \n\n- Ap \u2013 Podzols not hydromorphic without \u201cFe/Al pan\u201d, of sands (Gleyic podzols) \n\n- Pzh \u2013 Podzols hydromorphic with \u201cFe/Al pan\u201d, of sands (Haplic podzols) \n\n- Aph \u2013 Podzols hydromorphic without \u201cFe/Al pan\u201d, of sands (Haplic podzols) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Detailed Geology of Estarreja, 1:50000. Extracted from Carta Geol\u00f3gica de \nPortugal, 13C. (Teixeira &amp; Zbyszewski, 1976). \n\n \n Podzols are characterized by having low nutrient status, sandy texture, high C/N ratio, \n\nlow CEC, fast permeability and low pH value and therefore they are infertile soils, being \n\ntheir agricultural use limited. In\u00e1cio et al. (1998) described the soils of Estarreja as \n\npermeable acidic sandy soils with low humus content. These soils have normally low \n\nretention capacity and they represent a potential risk of contaminants transfer in the soil\u2013\n\nwater\u2013plant system. They are normally reserved for coniferous forestry, low intensity \n\ngrazing or are left fallow. However, if fertilizers, liming and irrigation are practised \n\nreasonable yields of arable crops may be achieved. The main problems found when \n\ngrowing crops regards to aluminium toxicity, restriction of nitrification and phosphorus \n\ndeficiency. Furthermore, podzolization results from the acidification of humus with the \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 24  \n \n\nformation of high quantities of organic compounds that migrate to the lower horizons, \n\nleading to the leaching out of iron and subsequent accumulation in lower horizons. As a \n\nresult, a thin iron pan which is impervious is formed and they may then have \n\nhydromorphic properties.  \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Hydrogeology \nOne of the most important local resources is the Aveiro multilayer quaternary aquifer that \n\ncovers an area of 650 km2 in the occidental meso-cenozoic sedimentary basin (Condesso \n\nde Melo, 2002) and can be divided in 3 units, installed in sandy loose formations: the upper, \n\nthe middle and the lower aquifers. Figure 3.5 shows the upper and the lower aquifers.  \n\nThe superficial (upper) aquifer is constituted by recent deposits of alluviums and sand \n\ndunes from Holocene age. These deposits are abundant in the western part along the \n\ncoast and inland along most of the riverbeds. The average thickness ranges between 8 to \n\n10 m, rarely exceeding 20 m of total thickness. They form a highly permeable (20 to 30 \n\nmd-1) shallow aquifer with an area of 500 Km2 (Condesso de Melo et al., 2002). The \n\naquifer receives direct or indirect recharge by infiltration of rainwater and irrigation, and \n\nthe discharge occurs in sea, in the lagoon, in the hydrographical network or in other \n\nadjacent aquifer levels, since induced by positive hydraulic gradients (Condesso de Melo \n\net al., 2002). It should be highlighted that there is a piezometric depression in the \n\nEstarreja area that can be due to its intensive exploration (Condesso de Melo, 2002; \n\nINAG - [w4]).  \n\n The lower aquifer, hydraulic free, is formed by old beach deposits and fluvial terraces \n\nfrom the Pilo-Pleistocene. These deposits are predominantly coarse sands, gravel \n\npebbles, which mainly occur along the eastern part of the region, where they overlay \n\neither Cretaceous or Triassic formations. The thickness area ranges between 10 to 20 m \n\nand the average permeability range from 5 to 10 md-1. The natural gradient in the terrace \n\ndeposits is from west to the east (0.004) where they discharge to the principal rivers that \n\nflow in the area (Condesso de Melo, 2002), being the principal hydrographic basins: \n\nVouga, Mondego, Ribeiras da Costa and Mangas das Ribeiras da Costa (in a total of \n\n924.9 km2). Another important characteristic of this region is the complex network of \n\nchannels from the lagoon (Ria de Aveiro) and the delta of River Vouga. \n\n This coastal aquifer is particularly vulnerable to saline intrusion but also, due to the \n\nhigh permeability of the sandy deposits and shallowness ground water table, it is \n\nextremely vulnerable to agricultural, urban and industrial contamination. It is known that in \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 25\n\nthe Estarreja municipality 79 % of the water from wells is unsuitable for consumption due \n\nto chemical contamination and 73 % due to bacteriological contamination (CME - [w5]). \n\nFurthermore, in this region there has been common practice to abstract water from the \n\nsuperficial aquifer for drinking, industrial and agricultural purposes. Therefore, appropriate \n\nmanagement and conservation policies should have been implemented in the region a \n\nlong time ago. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 The superficial and lower layers of the Aveiro multilayer quaternary aquifer and \nthe region river basins (INAG - [w4]\n\n ). \n\n \n \n\n3.3.

These changes don\u2019t seem to have any \n\nsignificant effect in the resident population from the municipality, being the variation \n\nbetween 1991 and 2001 of 5.4% (Table 3.2). There was an increase in the resident \n\npopulation from Bedu\u00eddo, where Estarreja is located, meaning that population can be \n\nincreasing in the urban area. When looking to the population distribution it\u2019s possible to \n\nsay that this municipality is characterized by a having a high percentage of young people \n\n(Figure 3.6).  \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Variation and population density of Estarreja Municipality between 1991 \nand 2001 (INE, 2002). \n\n Resident Population \nVariation \n\n(%) \n \n\nArea \n( km2 ) \n\n1991 2001 1991/2001\n\nPopulation Density \n2001 \n\n(hab/km2) \nAvanca 21.5 6426 6474 0.7 301.1 \nBedu\u00eddo 20.2 6731 7794 15.8 385.8 \nCanelas 10.2 1498 1486 -0.8 145.7 \nFermel\u00e3 13.0 1580 1482 -6.2 114.0 \nPardilh\u00f3 15.9 4234 4175 -1.4 262.6 \nSalreu 16.2 4157 4153 -0.09 256.3 \nVeiros 11.2 2116 2618 23.7 233.7 \n\nMunicipality 108.2 26742 28182 5.4 260.4 \n \n \n\n \nFigure 3.6 - Distribution of population in Estarreja municipality by age and by sex in 2001 \n(INE, 2002). \n\n \n The socio-economic factors have an important influence in land consumption.

Estarreja is a small city, with a small urban area that includes some \n\nagricultural areas. The main pressures are the industry near the centre and the moving of \n\npopulation to town centre. \n\n \n\n3.3.1 The industry in Estarreja region \nTable 3.3 shows the distribution of labourers in the industrial activities for Estarreja \n\nMunicipality and for the Aveiro\u00b4s District in 2003 (AIDA - [w6]). Besides the utmost \n\nimportance of chemical industry (for which Estarreja is mostly known), other industrial \n\nactivities can also be found in the municipality, such as food and drink, wood, cork, textiles \n\nand leather. However, agriculture is the most important economic sector (the main \n\nproductive source are animal sector and corn farming). \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 - Distribution of labourers in industries of the District of Aveiro and of Estarreja in \n2003 (data from AIDA - [w6]). \n\nIndustrial activity Estarreja Aveiro\u00b4s District \n\nFood and beverages  1108 12499 \n\nFabric 53 9697 \nClothing and dyeing  87 4392 \nLeather and leather product  2 29744 \nLumber processing  121 8189 \nCork  2 13429 \nPulp, paper and sub products 24 3370 \nEdition, impression and reproduction of recorded information 51 2317 \nChemicals  731 2389 \nProduction of rubber articles and plastic 35 6955 \nProduction of other non-metallic mineral products 104 17373 \nMetallurgies 2 4360 \nFactories of metallic products (except machines and equipments) 704 24415 \nMachines and equipment 58 12137 \nProduction of electrical devices 24 6914 \nElectronics 85 378 \nProduction of vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers 3 7338 \nProduction of other transportation materials 3 2967 \nFurniture factories and other non-specified industries 291 9875 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 29 \n \n\nProcessing industries play a major role on local economy (33.4% employment), being \n\nthe sector of metallurgies and metallic products the one that generates more employment \n\n(4.9%) (INE, 2002). In the second most important sector arise the food, beverages and \n\ntobacco industries, with 4.5%. In the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s the production of chemicals and fibbers \n\n(synthetic or artificial) played the principal role as source of jobs in the municipality of \n\nEstarreja. Corroborating the observed gradual decrease in the importance of this sector, it \n\nshould be noted that in 1991 this was the most important sector in a matter of employment \n\noffer and it turned, after ten years, into the fourth activity creator of jobs, highlighting once \n\nmore the deep restructure of the local industry. In spite of the crisis in the chemical \n\nindustry is often related with the increase in the cost of energy (Reis et al., 1996), the \n\nmodernization of the facilities is also responsible for the decrease in the need of labour. \n\nHowever, it is remarkable that almost 30% of the labourers in the chemical industry of the \n\ndistrict are working in Estarreja. \n\nThe major part of chemical industry is located inside the chemical complex called \n\n\u201cComplexo Qu\u00edmico de Estarreja (CQE)\u201d, an industrial area of 1 km2, located at 1 km from \n\nthe Estarreja town centre (which has an area of about 2.5 km2). The most significant \n\nindustrial units in CQE are: \n\n- Quimigal [w7]: installed in 1952, produced ammonium sulphate, from sulphuric \n\nacid and ammonia, since the beginning, and nitric acid and ammonium nitrate \n\nsince 1974. These productions stopped in the early 1990s and a new unit (aniline \n\nde Portugal) started in 1978 for the production of nitric acid, aniline and \n\nnitrobenzene, which is still running. Other products are chlorine, sodium hydroxide \n\nand hydrogen. Since 1990, electrolytic cells with mercury cathodes have been \n\nsubstituted by membrane technology.  \n\n- Uniteca [w8]: working since 1956 to produce chlorine, sodium hydroxide, \n\nhydrogen and derivate compounds as sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid \n\nfrom rock salt, using until 1992 electrolytic cells with mercury cathodes.  \n\n- Cires [w9]: the plant started up in 1963 producing only suspension PVC (S-PVC), \n\nbeing pioneer in the manufacture of thermoplastics materials. In 1982, emulsion \n\nPVC started to be manufactured for paste grade resins, the VICIR-E. \n\n- Dow Portugal [w10]: producing since 1978 isocyanide polymers of aromatic base \n\nand polystyrene polymers for thermal isolation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 30  \n \n\n3.3.2 Transport facilities \nThe resident population is mostly settled along the major road that crosses the \n\nmunicipality in the North-South direction (EN 109), which was during decades one of the \n\nmain connections between the north and centre of coastal Portugal.

Environmental Quality of Estarreja \n3.4.1 Emissions from nearby industry \nIn a context of a lack of information about environmental issues, together with intensive \n\nindustrial activity, during decades, direct discharge of effluents into natural water streams \n\nand uncontrolled waste disposal on ground were practiced (Hall, 1982; Pereira et al., \n\n1997; Costa &amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001). Since 1950s until 1975, the liquid effluents were \n\ndischarged directly into manmade water streams (Vala de S. Filipe, Vale de Breja and \n\nVala do Canedo), being transported for several kilometres through the agricultural fields, \n\nmainly to the river branch named Esteiro de Estarreja that ends in a lagoon basin called \n\n\u201cLaranjo\u201d (Barradas et al., 1992; In\u00e1cio et al., 1998, Costa &amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001). The \n\nliquid effluents from these industrial units contain mainly aniline, benzene, \n\nmonochlorobenzene, mononitrobenzene, arsenic, mercury, zinc and lead (Batista et al., \n\n2002). Until 1990 Quimigal and Uniteca used electrolytic cells with mercury cathodes, but \n\nthey have been substituted by a cleaner technology, membrane cells, being this \n\nconversion finished in 1998. Therefore Hg is one of the most concerns of this area. \n\nSeveral studies where conducted in Estarreja in order to assess the local contamination, \n\nbut most of them where mostly focused in the contamination near the industrial complex \n\n(In\u00e1cio et al., 1998; Costa &amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001; Batista et al., 2002) and with the \n\ncontamination through river streams leading to the Ria de Aveiro Lagoon (Abreu et al., \n\n1998; Pereira et al., 1998; Monterroso et al., 2003; Coelho et al., 2005). Other studies \n\nconducted in this area include the study of Hg in plants, biota and in the water column \n\nfrom the lagoon (Ramalhosa et al., 2001; Pereira et al., 2005; Coelho et al., 2006). It has \n\nbeen reported high concentrations of toxic pollutants, mainly potentially toxic metals and \n\nmetalloids (namely As, Hg, Pb and Zn), in the soil of the industrial area, however much \n\nhigher concentrations were found in the sediments of the water streams, several \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 31\n\nkilometres away from the industrial complex (Costa &amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001; Batista et al., \n\n2002). Moreover, it is estimated that, in spite of the strong reduction on the input since \n\n1994, it will be needed many decades until the Lagoon recovery (Pereira et al., 1997; \n\nAbreu et al., 1998). \n\nIn\u00e1cio et al. (1998) concluded that air contamination was higher next to the emission \n\npoint inside the industrial perimeter decreasing with distance. In terms of air emissions of \n\npollutants monitored in a station located inside the urban perimeter, the medium daily \n\nemission of SO2 was 1.9 \u00b5g/m3 in 2006 (Instituto do Ambiente - [w11]), for particulate \n\nmatter less than 10 \u00b5m (PM10) in the same year the medium value was 35 \u00b5g/m3/day, \n\nand in what concerns NO2 the value is 19.6 \u00b5g/m3/day. These emissions are mainly from \n\nindustrial activities.  \n\n The Air Quality Index (Instituto do Ambiente - [w11]) for Estarreja area is shown in \n\nFigure 3.7. This index is a result of an arithmetic average of each pollutant concentration \n\nin all stations of the area. The values are compared with ranges of concentrations \n\nassociated with a colour scale, with major importance given to the most toxic pollutants.  \n\n Emission data can also be found in the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER -\n\n[w12]). EPER was established by a Commission Decision of 17 July 2000. The EPER \n\nDecision is based on Article 15(3) of Council Directive 96/61/EC concerning integrated \n\npollution prevention and control. EPER contains data on pollutant emissions to air and \n\nwater reported by around 10,000 large and medium-sized industrial facilities in the former \n\n15 EU Member States, Hungary and Norway. Fifty pollutants are covered and all reported \n\nemissions data are publicly accessible through the EPER website. \n\n \n\nAir quality index\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n120\n140\n160\n\nvery good good medium weak bad\n\nIndex\n\nN\no.\n\n o\nf d\n\nay\ns \n\n \nFigure 3.7 - Air Quality Indexes for Estarreja during 2005. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 32 \n\nFigure 3.8 shows the activities in the region of Aveiro.

Sampling plan and strategy adopted for Estarreja \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 36  \n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 37\n\nThe definition of a written sampling plan (sampling protocol) with a detailed description of \n\nprocedures to be followed is one of the first steps of the Quality Control/Quality Assurance \n\n(QC/QA) strategy. The sampling plan for Estarreja took into account the considerations \n\nmentioned in the previous chapter. The sites were previously selected, the sample strategy \n\nestablished and samples collected. The sites selected were not always feasible for sampling, \n\nand the network had to be kept open and adopted to verification of the field conditions. The \n\nprocedures adopted for sampling and sample pre-treatment were based on ISO (ISO, \n\n1994a) or USEPA (1996a) methods.  \n\n \n\n4.1. Sampling design of Estarreja urban soils \nSites were selected in order to cover the urban area and to have enough number of \n\nsamples for each land use selected. The land uses selected were: ornamental gardens \n\n(OG), roadsides (RD), parks (PO) and agricultural (AG). Some samples were collected \n\noutside the urban area in order to compare results with the city centre and to assess what \n\nare the major influences in the quality of the soils, i.e. the urban area itself or the chemical \n\nindustries near the town centre. It was decided to collect in agricultural sites because \n\nthere are many agricultural areas within the city area, being an important use of the soil in \n\nEstarreja. Two sampling depths were considered (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) in order to \n\nassess differences between layers. For each sampling site one of the following sampling \n\nregimes was adopted (Davidson &amp; Urquhart, 2002): \n\na) Sampling Regime 1 \nApplicable to larger, visually homogenous, areas of soil where the entire area can be \n\ndefined as a single \u201csite\u201d and where it is desirable to obtain an indication of the average \n\nsoil quality. This could include, for example, areas within parks, gardens, cemeteries, \n\nforested or agricultural areas (typically > 1 ha). First the area of interest is defined and \n\nthen divided into a regular grid. The sampling points may be randomly select i.e. a number \n\nof cells from the grid (typically sampling density ~ 20 per hectare) or collect a composite \n\nsample every 1-3 ha (Figure 4.1). A single sample from each sampling point is collected \n\nand then combined to form the bulk sample for the site. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n                                                1 m \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Scheme for composite samples. \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 38  \n \n\nb) Sampling Regime 2 \nApplicable to smaller, visually homogeneous, areas of soil. This could include, for \n\nexample, a flowerbed in a small ornamental garden, or a single allotment. An area of ~ 1 \n\nm2 is defined and a sample close to each of the corners of the square and one from the \n\ncentre is collected and then combined to form the composite sample for the site. The area \n\nshould, as far as possible, be typical of the site and removed from point sources of \n\ncontaminants such as metal fence posts etc.  \n\nc) Sampling Regime 3 \nApplicable to areas such as roadsides and riverbanks, where it may be important to \n\ndetermine average soil quality along a length of the roadside or bank. A transect along a \n\nroadside or riverbank (e.g. ~ 50 m in length) is defined and a sample is taken from one or \n\nmore sampling points (e.g. every ~ 10 m along the transect). Samples are then combined \n\nto form the bulk sample for the site.  \n\n \n\n4.2. Sampling scheme and instructions \nAfter defining each one of the sampling points on the field, surface vegetation is removed. \n\nFor each sample, a \u201csite Sampling Record\u201d (Annex I) is completed at the sampling site. \n\nThis record has details on: sample identification, sample log record (sampling site name, \n\ndate and time of collection, GPS coordinates, sampling conditions, relevant sample site \n\nobservations, signature of the sample collector(s)) and chain of custody record (record of \n\npersonnel handling samples on the field). Care should be taken to ensure that the \n\nproximity of road (distance from the road and traffic intensity) or another potential pollution \n\nsource is indicated and described. A chain of custody record (record of personnel \n\nhandling samples on the field) was also kept. Table 4.1 shows a resume of sampling \n\nprocedures for different purposes. \n\n4.2.1 Procedure to collect urban soil samples \n\u2022 Use a stainless steel spade to dig the hole and plastics spades for sampling \n\ncollection; \n\n\u2022 Take samples at two depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm); \n\n\u2022 Collect samples according to procedures described for inorganics (4.2.2) and \norganics (4.2.3); \n\n\u2022 Use GPS to register location of sampling sites; \n\n\u2022 Follow QC/QA directions for soil sampling: use of \u201cSite Sampling Record\u201d for each \nsample. \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 39 \n \n\nSample labelling and transport: \nEach site and each sampling depth has a unique code. A standard sampling code should \n\nbe used, where the number is the number of the site. As an example, the first soil sample, \n\nfor the 0-10 cm depth is labelled as \u201cEST.OG.01.SF\u201d, which stands for \u201cEstarreja\u201d (EST), \n\n\u201cOrnamental Garden\u201d (OG), site number 1 (01) and surface sample (SF). At the same site \n\nthe subsurface sample (10-20 cm) is labelled as \u201cEST.OG.01.SB\u201d.  \n\nCleaning of tools: \nAll sampling equipment was cleaned with distilled water and paper towels, between usages. \n\nSoil samples were handled using plastic gloves (except for organics). \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Sampling procedure for inorganics \nAround 2 kg of soil was taken from the 10 cm top layer with a plastic spade, and kept in a \n\nlabelled plastic bag (Table 4.1). The same is done for the 10-20 cm layer. Samples were \n\nstored in plastic bags, labelled, placed in boxes and transported to the laboratory. \n\n4.2.3 Sampling procedure for organic compounds \nPlastics were avoided because phthalates, commonly used as plasticizers and easily \n\nextracted from plastic material, can interfere with results and therefore compromise all the \n\nanalytical process. Moreover, samples were not collected or stored in the presence of \n\nexhaust fumes. \n\n Around 500g of soil is collected with a stainless steel spade and immediately wrapped \n\nwith aluminium foil (Table 4.1). The wrapped portion of soil was placed inside of a plastic \n\nbag guaranteeing that the sample would not be in touch with the bag and the container is \n\nthen labelled. Samples were kept cool (~4 \u00baC), in the dark and transported to the \n\nlaboratory as soon as possible after collection. \n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Resume of sampling procedures for organics and inorganics.  \n\n Analysis \nSampling \n\ntool \nSampling \n\ndepth \nAmount of \n\nsample \nSample \n\ncontainer \nQC/QA Max.

Estarreja soil sampling maps \nThe digital cartography available was used to produce maps for sampling campaigns. \n\nMaps were produced on a GIS basis (ARCGIS 9.0\u00ae). These maps were used both to \n\ndefine sampling points (soil sampling protocols) and to present soil quality data. A GPS \n\n(Global Positioning System) was also used to input coordinates of sampled points on \n\nthese maps.  \n\n Twenty six sites were sampled, at two depths, as it is shown in Figure 4.2. The land \n\nuses sampled were: ornamental gardens (OG), roadsides (RD), parks (PO) and \n\nagricultural (AG). As most roadsides in the urban area are subject of active planning and \n\nmay also be considered ornamental gardens, another type of land use can be defined \n\n(Ornamental Garden/Roadsides (OG/RD). The number of samples collected for each one \nof the land uses is shown in Table 4.2. The initial choice of the sampling sites was \n\nfollowed, however, as sampling was accompanied by the Municipality staff it\u2019s was just \n\npossible to sample were it was allowed. Due to this limitation in two sites (site 1 and 8) \n\nonly the first depth was collected, resulting in a total of 50 samples. Besides, in what \n\nconcerns agricultural sites sampling was subjected to an authorization of the land owner. \n\nIn Annex II it\u2019s presented a resume with the location and description of Estarreja soils \n\nsampling sites. Sampling campaign occurred during May of 2005. \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Number of samples collected in Estarreja for each land use (see also \nFigure 4.2). \n\nLand Use n\u00ba of sites Sites n\u00ba \nOG 2 2,16 \nPO 2 13,14 \n\nOG/RD 5 3,7,8,9,12 \nRD 6 1,4,5,6,10,11 \nAG 11 15,17 to 26 \n\nTotal 26  \n \n\n4.4. Sample Pre-Treatment and Storage  \n4.4.1 Sample pre-treatment and storage for inorganics \nThe pre-treatment of samples was done in accordance to ISO method 11464:1994 (ISO, \n\n1994a). This International Standard specifies the pre-treatment required for soil samples \n\nthat are to be subjected to physical-chemical analysis and describes the following five \n\ntypes of pre-treatment of samples: drying, crushing, sieving, dividing and milling. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 41\n\nChemical \ncomplex\n\nEsteiro de Estarreja \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Localization of sampling sites in Estarreja, the chemical complex and the urban \narea (1:10.000, from S\u00e9rie Ortofotocartogr\u00e1fica Nacional, IGP). \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 42  \n \n\n Soil samples were oven dried at 40 \u00baC as soon as arrived to laboratory to minimize \n\nmicrobial activity (mineralization).

The soil was sieved, with a nylon \n\nsieve, and the fraction smaller than 2 mm (10-mesh) was stored in the absence of light, \n\nfor further analysis. Subsamples of 50g were taken from the fraction smaller than 2 mm, \n\ngrinded (agate rings mill) and sieved to a fraction smaller than 150 ?m.

Samples should be \n\nextracted within 15 days of sampling (Table 4.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 43 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5.

Introduction \nThe following set of parameters was selected in order to obtain a general characterisation \n\nof Estarreja urban soils: soil pH in water (pHW) and in CaCl2 (pHCa), total C, N and H \n\npercentages, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable bases, organic matter \n\ncontent by Loss on Ignition (LOI) and particle size distribution (PSD).  \n\n Soil pH can be used as an indicator of the acidity or alkalinity in the soil. It has different \n\nsources and in natural systems the pH is affected by the mineralogy, climate, and \n\nweathering. The pH of a soil affects the availability of both the essential elements such as \n\nphosphorous (P), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc \n\n(Zn), as well as non essential elements, such as aluminium (Al) or other potentially toxic \n\nmetals (Zhou et al., 2000).  \n\n Another important parameter to assess soils quality is soil organic matter (SOM) that \n\ncomprises a variety of carbonaceous materials including humus, soil micro-organisms, \n\nplant and animal residues, coal, charcoal, coke and graphite (NEPC, 1999). Soil Organic \n\nCarbon (SOC) is the most abundant element of SOM and represents a significant \n\ncomponent of the global carbon, being soil pool and processes important regulators of \n\nCO2 in the atmosphere (Konen et al., 2002). Other elements of SOM include nitrogen, \n\noxygen, hydrogen, sulphur and phosphorous. The importance of SOM regards mainly due \n\nto its relevant role, together with pH, on trace metals mobility and bioavailability. In \n\naddition, SOM can interact strongly with many other organic compounds resulting in \n\ncomplexed species that shows altered reactivity (either enhanced or diminished), \n\naffecting, for example, the bioactivity, persistence and biodegrability of pesticides \n\n(Stevenson, 1982). It is also a source of hydrogen ions, through dissociation of acidic \n\ngroups, and is therefore an environmental component which determines the bulk pH as \n\nwell as the availability of protons.  \n\n Nutrients such as nitrogen (N), sulphur (S), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium \n\n(K) and sodium (Na) are originated from rock weathering and from atmospheric \n\ndeposition. The amounts of nutrients supplied will therefore be dependent of local \n\ngeology, rainfall and the proximity to the sea, sources of atmospheric pollution and \n\natmospheric dust. The cations Ca, Mg, Na and K, are known as basic cations and they \n\nexist in soil primarily as exchangeable cations on the colloidal complex of the soil or they \n\noccur as simple inorganic salts (SPAC, 1999). The negative charges on clay and humus is \n\nbalanced by charges on these cations and also by H+ and aluminium ions (Al3+, AlOH2+, \n\nAl(OH)2+) which are known as acidic cations (Wild, 1993). The ability of soil to yield \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 46  \n \n\ncations is known as Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). This is, therefore, the measure of \n\nthe readily exchangeable cations that neutralize negative charges of soil components, \n\nbeing important as source of nutrients (Ca, Mg, K and Na) and as buffer of pH.   \n\n Soil texture is also called particle or grain size distribution of particles constituting the \n\nsoil (Boulding, 1994). The inorganic constituents of soil are sand, silt and clay, formed by \n\nweathering of parent rocks. Clay minerals together with SOM are particularly important \n\nfrom the environmental point of view due to their ability to adsorb ions, molecules and \n\ngases and therefore hold toxic pollutants.   \n\n Concluding, all these parameters are very important for assess soil function as they are \n\nresponsible by providing nutrients to plants, contaminants mobility and water holding \n\ncapacity. In addition, soil as sorptive characteristics, due to the electrical charges and \n\nlarge surface area of the clay mineral and humus (Wild, 1993). As a result, soil acts as \n\nbuffer zone between the atmosphere and groundwater (Guven\u00e7 et al., 2003), and in an \n\nurban context this property is extremely important due to the high atmospheric inputs.  \n\n \n\n5.2. Analytical methods and QC/QA procedures \n5.2.1 pHw and pHCa \nSamples pH was determined according to the ISO method 10390:1994 (ISO, 1994b) \n\nusing a glass electrode (WTW, Sentix 41) both, in a 1:5 (m/v) suspension of soil in water \n\n(pHW) and in a solution of 0.01 mol/l calcium chloride (pHCa). Determination was \n\nundertaken in the &lt;2 mm soil fraction, for both surface and subsurface layer in a total of \n\n50 samples. \n\n A sub-sample of five grams of soil was taken to a centrifuge tube and it was added five \n\ntimes its volume of water or calcium chloride solution. Suspension was mixed using a \n\nmechanical shaker during 5 minutes, left for at least 2h, but no longer than 24 h. The pH \n\ndeterminations were performed twice, after 2 h and 20 h. Just before the determination of \n\npH, the suspension was shaken thoroughly and the pH was measured in the settling \n\nsuspension. The pH value was read after stabilization (pH value over a period of 5s does \n\nnot vary more than 0.02 units). The pH-meter (WTW, mod. 538) was calibrated as \n\nprescribed in the manufacturer's manual, using buffer commercial solutions with pH 4.00 \n\nand 7.00. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 47 \n \n\n5.2.2 Elemental Analysis (C, N and H) \nDeterminations were performed with an instrument for CHN microanalysis (LECO, CHNS-\n\n932) that measures carbon and hydrogen by means of individual, infrared detection \n\nsystems while nitrogen is measured in a thermal conductivity detector system. \n\nDeterminations are undertaken directly in sub-samples of around 1 g of soil milled and \n\nsieved to&lt;150 ?m, for both layers, being the total of samples analysed 50.  \n\n \n\n5.2.3 Organic matter (OM) \nTotal soil organic matter was estimated by measuring the weight loss due to the \n\ncombustion (loss-on-ignition), upon heating at 430\u00baC according to Schumacher (2002). \n\nAbout ten grams of soil, sieved to&lt;2 mm, were dried at 105 \u00baC for four hours to remove \n\nany residual water. Samples were then ashed at 430 \u00baC until constant weight (about 16 \n\nhours), and then allowed to cool in a dessicator. Each sample was weighed, prior and \n\nafter heating, and the decrease in weight was calculated as a proportion of the initial \n\nweight and expressed as a percentage weight loss. Determinations were done in both \n\nsurface and subsurface samples in a total of 50 samples.  \n\n \n\n5.2.4 Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) \nPotential CEC and exchangeable cations were determined in barium chloride solution \n\nbuffered at pH = 8.1 using triethanolamine, following the principles of the ISO method \n\n13536:1995 (ISO, 1995a). The principle of this method consists in an initial saturation of \n\nthe soil with a buffered barium chloride solution, followed by an addition of a known \n\nexcess of magnesium sulphate solution that precipitates all the barium present (in solution \n\nas well as adsorbed, in the form of highly insoluble barium sulphate) and the sites with \n\nexchangeable ions are then readily occupied by magnesium. The excess magnesium is \n\nthen determined by titration and sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium are \n\ndetermined in the barium chloride extract of the soil (exchangeable bases). \n\nTwo grams of air-dried soil (<2 mm fraction, surface layer) were weighted into a \n\ncentrifuge tube and exactly 25 ml of the extraction solution was added to the sample. The \n\nextraction solution was prepared by dissolving 100 g of barium chloride dihydrate \n\n(BaCl2.2H2O) in about 800 ml of distilled water, adding 22.5 ml of triethanolamine \n\n(HOCH2CH2)3N, adjusting the pH at 8.1+/-0.1 with HCl (1:1 v/v) and diluting to 1000 ml. \n\nThe barium-ions exchange with cations present in the soil. Sample was then shaken for 3 \n\nmin, rested for 5 min and shaken again for 3 min. The sample was centrifuged \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 48 \n\n(3000rpmX5min) and the supernatant was transferred to a volumetric flask, diluted to 100 \n\nml, filtered (Whatman 54, Cat N\u00ba1454, d=11cm, retention 20-25 mm, maximum ash per \n\ncircle 0.05 mg) and preserved for analysis of the exchangeable cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, \n\nCa2+).  \n\nThe precipitate was washed by adding 25ml of distilled water followed by \n\ncentrifugation; after decantation of the supernatant to waste the precipitate was weighted \n\nto determine the water fraction present in the soil. The sample was then treated with 25 ml \n\nof 0.1M MgSO4, shaken for 5 min and after centrifugation (3000rpmX5min) the \n\nsupernatant was filtered. Exactly 10ml were titrated with EDTA 0.05N. For titration, 10ml \n\nof extract were transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, approximately 10ml of the buffer \n\nsolution NH3aq/NH4Cl (pH=10) and 20 ml of distilled water, were added. The indicator \n\nused was Eriochrome Black T added in an enough amount to produce wine-red colour. \n\nSolution was titrated with an EDTA standard solution to a clear blue colour.

Sodium and potassium were measured in the acidified barium chloride-\n\ntriethanolamine extract of soil samples by flame emission spectrometry (FES, Model GBC \n\nseries 906 AA). The calibration series used ranged from 0.3 to 3 mg/l for Na and from \n\n0.25 to 1.5 mg/l for K. Two millilitres of filtrate obtained (see point 5.2.4), 1 ml of HCl 1 \n\nmol/l and 7 ml of water were added to a test tube and mixed. The same was done to the \n\nblank extract. Sodium was determined at 589 nm and potassium at 766 nm using an \n\nair/propane flame. \n\nCalcium and magnesium were determined in the acidified barium chloride \n\ntriethanolamine extract by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS, Model GBC \n\nseries 906 AA). The calibration series used ranged from 1 to 5 mg/l for both elements. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 49\n\nOne millilitre of filtrate obtained (see point 5.2.4), 1 ml of HCl 1 mol/l and 8 ml of water \n\nwere added to a tube and mixed.

The determination of the sand fraction (2-0.075 \n\nmm) was obtained by dry sieving using the 75 \u00b5m ASTM standard sieve. Sand (0.075-\n\n0.050 mm), silt (0.050-0.002 mm) and clay (<0.002 mm) fractions were quantified by using \n\nthe Micromeritics\u00ae Sedigraph 5100. Around 3 g of each sample (from&lt;0.075 mm \n\nfraction) were accurately weighed and 0.16 mM sodium hexametaphosphate solution was \n\nadded. The solution was fully dispersed using an ultrasonicator in order to disperse \n\nsample aggregates. The sedigraph was cleaned using distilled water and calibrated using \n\nthe Spectromelt A 12 (66% di-Lithium tetraborate/34% Litium metaborate) (1.5 ?m) \n\nreference material.  \n\n Each sample was then classified according to the percentages to the USDA classes by \n\nusing the Talwin 42\u00ae classification software program. The classification was done only for \n\nSF layer in a total of 26 samples. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 50 \n\n5.2.7 QC/QA Procedures  .2.7 QC/QA Procedures  \nMethod blanks were performed for all parameters, and at least one blank analysis was \n\nperformed per process batch (10 samples).

Results and discussion  \nDescriptive statistics was initially performed on the data, histograms and box-plots were \n\nobtained and normality was tested by running the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (SPSS 11.0) \n\n(results are shown in Annex III). As not all parameters follow a normal distribution, non-\n\nparametric statistics was used. Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was used for the \n\ncomparisons between the two layers of urban soil, when applicable. All variables were \n\nthen tested for correlations (for SF layer) and Principal Component Analysis (using \n\nSTATISTICA\u00ae 6.0 software) was used to identify relationships between them, after log \n\ntransformation of the original data. Finally, the influence of the land use was studied by \n\nusing the Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks test. \n\n \n\n5.3.1 Characterization of physical and chemical properties of urban soils from \nEstarreja \n\n5.3.1.1 Soil reaction of Estarreja samples \nSummary statistics of pH determination for both, water and calcium chloride, in the two \n\nlayers are shown in Table 5.3. For pHw the median value in surface layer (SF) was 6.21, \n\nranging from 4.83 to 7.16, and in subsurface layer (SB) it was 6.09, ranging from 4.53 to \n\n8.15. The median value of pHCa for SF layer samples was 5.15, ranging from 4.08 to 6.88, \n\nand for SB layer this value was 4.91, ranging from 3.9 to 7.35. The results for pHCa is \n\nabout 0.5 to 1.0 pH units lower than for water extract, due to the higher concentration of \n\nH+ ions in solution as a result of ion exchange with Ca2+ in soil particles. This method \n\ngives more precise values, being recommended where the salt content may influence the \n\npH value. Nevertheless, just for classification purposes of the pHw in both layers, USDA \n\n[w13] classes will be used for setting the acidity and alkalinity limits as shown in Figure 5.2. \n\n \nTable 5.3 \u2013Summary statistics for pH (water and CaCl2) in surface (SF) \nand subsurface (SB) layers. \n\n pHw pHCa \n SF SB SF SB \nmean 6.13 6.15 5.21 5.19 \nmedian 6.21 6.09 5.15 4.91 \nst. dev 0.56 0.88 0.69 0.95 \nmax 7.16 8.15 6.88 7.35 \nmin 4.83 4.53 4.08 3.90 \nrange 2.33 3.62 2.80 3.45 \nRSD (%) 9.1 14.3 13.2 18.3 \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 53\n\nDifferences between sample depths were observed for some individual samples but no \n\ngeneral pattern was found, and when performing the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test \n\ndifferences were not statistical significant. Both, the lowest (sample 15.AG) and the \n\nhighest value (sample 6.RD) of pH were found in the SB layer. In both cases the \n\ndifference between the two layers is quite significant, yet in the second case the difference \n\nis even greater. \n\nAccording to the USDA classification soils having a pH less than 6.6 are classified as \n\nacidic, when is above 7.3 are alkaline and when between those values are neutral soils. \n\nFrom Figure 5.2 and Table 5.3 its possible to conclude that Estarreja soils are, in what \n\nconcerns the median value, classified as slightly acid (6.1<pH<6.5), with most of the \n\nsamples bellow the acidity upper limit. Following the USDA classification (Figure 5.3 and \n\nFigure 5.4), samples 18.AG (SF and SB) and 15.AG.SB are considered very strongly acid \n\n(4.5<pH<5.0), and samples 22.AG (SF and SB) and 9.OG/RD.SF are considered strongly \n\nacid (5.1<pH<5.5). On the other hand, samples 11.RD.SB and 26.AG.SB were classified \n\nas slightly alkaline (7.4<pH<7.8) and sample 6.RD.SB was considered moderately \n\nalkaline (7.9<pH<8.4).  \n\n \n\nR\nD\n\n. 0\n1\n\nO\nG\n\n.0\n2\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n3\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n4\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n5\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n6\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n7\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n8\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n9\n\nR\nD\n\n.1\n0\n\nR\nD\n\n.1\n1\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.1\n2\n\nP\nO\n\n.1\n3\n\nP\nO\n\n.1\n4\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n5\n\nO\nG\n\n.1\n6\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n7\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n8\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n9\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n0\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n1\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n2\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n3\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n4\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n5\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n6\n\nSample\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n2\n\n6\n\n10\n\n14\n\npH\nSF\nSB\nAcidity upper limit\nAlkalinity lower limit\n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - Results pHw for Estarreja samples in both layers and both acidity and alkalinity \nlimits (as defined by USDA [w13]).  \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 54 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 Spatial distribution of the pHw for each sample in SF layer, according to USDA \nclasses [w13]. \n\n \n\nAlthough non-natural soil alkalinity has been reported in urban soils, due to the release \n\nof calcareous solutions from building wastes (Jim, 1998), this was not verified in Estarreja. \n\nThe main reason for the acidity reported in Estarreja soils is likely to be the soil type, \n\nhowever other factors such as atmospheric inputs from industry (especially HCl, HNO3, \n\nNH3, NH4+), gases from atmosphere (SO2, CO2), deposit of aerosols and the acidic rain \n\nmay have some importance (Wild, 1993). Values of SO2 measured in the monitoring \n\nstation of Estarreja (see point 3.4) are not very high (bellow the maximum value of 125 \n\n\u00b5g/m3 daily base, with very few days exceeding this value) and the same was observed \n\nfor NO2. However, as it is possible to observe in Table 3.4, the industry around Estarreja \n\nreleases several tons of SOx and NOx. In addition, pH in rainwater for Aveiro region can be \n\nconsidered acid (about 5.4), being found values as low as 5.0 (Condesso de Melo, 2002).  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 55\n\n \nFigure 5.4 \u2013 Spatial distribution of the pHw for each sample in SB layer, according to USDA \nclasses [w13]. \n \n\nA pH range of 6 to 7 is generally most favourable for plant growth due to availability of \n\nnutrients (USDA - [w13]). These values were not observed in all Estarreja samples being \n\neither too low or too high. Samples 9.OG/RD.SF, 15.AG.SB, 18.AG, 20.AG.SB and \n\n22.AG.SF (pH<5.5) or samples 6.RD.SB and 11.RD.SB (pH>7.8) will show problems on \n\nnutrients availability either due to their high or low solubility. Another important effect of pH \n\nis the solubility of potentially toxic metals under acid conditions which can move \n\ndownward with water through the soil, in some cases moving to aquifers or surface \n\nstreams.  \n \n\n5.3.1.2 Characterization of SOM and Total C, N and H in Estarreja soils \nOM was estimated by loss-on-ignition and results for each individual sample are shown in \n\nTable 5.4, together with results of total C, N and H. Figure 5.5 shows the box plots, \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 56 \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n \n \n\nincluding the outliers and extreme values, for these parameters. For surface (SF) samples \n\nthe median value of OM was 4.4 %, ranging from 1.8 to 8.9% and for subsurface (SB) \n\nsamples the median value was 3.4%, ranging from 1.6 to 6.2% (Table 5.5). Therefore, \n\nconsidering the median, soils from SF layer can be considered as having a high content of \n\nOM (>4%) and soils from SB layer have a medium content (4<OM%<2) (Boulding, 1994).  \n\nThe difference between the two layers was found to be statistically different (Mann-\n\nWhitney Rank Sum Test, P=0.006), being the SF layer normally enriched in OM. In Figure \n\n5.5 and Figure 5.6 it is possible to observe these differences between layers and between \n\nsites, as well as samples that are above and bellow the median value. The enrichment \n\nfactor of OM, the ratio between OM (%) in SF and SB (EF=SF/SB), was calculated for \n\neach sample and results (Table 5.4) shows that this ratio is equal or higher than one for all \n\nsamples, reaching values as high as 2.7 (sample 6.RD).  \n\nSBSFSB\n\n \n\nSFSBSFSBSF\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\nFigure 5.5 \u2013 Box plots of OM, TC, TH, TN in both surfaces, with the median, the \ninterquartile range, the outliers (between 1.5 - 3 box lengths) and extreme values (more \nthan 3 box lengths). \n\n264\n\n25\n\n4\n\n2325\n\nOM TH TC TN \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 57 \n \n\nTable 5.4 \u2013 Values of Total C, N, H, ratio C/N, OM (%), enrichment factor (EF) and OC/OM for Estarreja samples. \n\nTotal Carbon % Total Nitrogen % Total Hydrogen % Ratio C/N OM (%) EF OC/OM Sample \nSF SB SF SB SF SB SF SB SF SB  SF SB \n\n01.RD 2.69 - 0.24 - 0.99 - 11.2 - 6.12 - - 44.0 - \n04.RD 5.05 2.18 0.38 0.17 1.32 0.67 13.0 12.8 7.32 5.42 1.35 69.0 40.2 \n05.RD 2.24 1.02 0.25 0.13 0.71 0.49 8.96 7.85 3.74 2.44 1.53 59.9 41.8 \n06.RD 3.58 1.01 0.29 0.10 1.27 0.60 12.3 10.1 8.35 3.08 2.71 42.9 32.8 \n10.RD 2.22 1.45 0.23 0.18 1.11 0.91 9.65 8.06 6.04 4.43 1.36 36.8 32.7 \n11.RD 0.80 0.49 0.08 0.05 0.32 0.36 10.0 9.80 1.83 1.63 1.12 43.7 30.1 \n07.OG/RD 2.70 0.88 0.26 0.08 1.09 0.42 10.4 11.0 3.86 2.38 1.62 69.9 37.0 \n08.OG/RD 1.45 - 0.17 - 0.91 - 8.53 - 4.22 - - 34.4 - \n09.OG/RD 1.31 1.35 0.14 0.15 0.78 0.83 9.36 9.00 3.92 3.32 1.18 33.4 40.7 \n12.OG/RD 2.09 1.03 0.21 0.11 0.87 0.53 9.95 9.36 3.75 2.91 1.29 55.7 35.4 \n03.OG/RD 3.56 1.46 0.35 0.13 0.93 0.46 10.2 11.2 7.23 2.83 2.55 49.2 51.6 \n02.OG 2.74 2.08 0.25 0.20 0.83 0.75 11.0 10.4 6.34 5.60 1.13 43.2 37.1 \n16.OG 1.41 1.15 0.16 0.15 0.82 0.63 8.81 7.67 4.24 3.39 1.25 33.3 33.9 \n13.PO 2.17 1.47 0.21 0.15 0.76 0.62 10.3 9.80 5.50 3.87 1.42 39.5 38.0 \n14.PO 3.56 1.85 0.32 0.22 1.57 1.08 11.1 8.41 8.89 5.66 1.57 40.0 32.7 \n15.AG 2.06 2.79 0.17 0.30 0.55 0.80 12.1 9.30 4.64 4.71 0.99 44.4 59.2 \n17.AG 1.82 1.75 0.21 0.20 0.65 0.68 8.67 8.75 4.54 4.76 0.95 40.1 36.8 \n18.AG 1.46 1.53 0.16 0.14 0.45 0.48 9.13 10.9 3.19 3.42 0.93 45.8 44.7 \n19.AG 2.30 1.18 0.25 0.13 0.73 0.52 9.20 9.08 4.81 3.64 1.32 47.8 32.4 \n20.AG 2.04 1.97 0.24 0.26 0.51 0.58 8.50 7.58 4.59 3.27 1.40 44.4 60.2 \n21.AG 2.03 1.81 0.21 0.20 0.58 0.55 9.67 9.05 4.08 4.27 0.96 49.8 42.4 \n22.AG 1.90 1.38 0.24 0.19 0.60 0.49 7.92 7.26 4.05 3.19 1.27 46.9 43.3 \n23.AG 1.68 1.38 0.25 0.52 0.48 0.42 6.72 2.65 3.54 3.24 1.09 47.5 42.6 \n24.AG 1.41 1.23 0.23 0.23 0.53 0.46 6.13 5.35 3.53 3.17 1.11 39.9 38.8 \n25.AG 3.76 2.90 0.50 0.44 1.44 1.15 7.52 6.59 8.52 6.19 1.38 44.1 46.8 \n26.AG 1.37 1.78 0.31 0.45 0.77 0.95 4.42 3.96 3.22 3.32 0.97 42.5 53.6 \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 58 \n\nIn what concerns the percentages of total C, N and H, the median concentration was \n\nfound to be higher in the SF layer than in the SB for the three parameters (Table 5.5), \n\nbeing the difference between the two layers statistically significant for all cases (Mann-\n\nWhitney Rank Sum Test, P=0.002 for TC, P=0.014 for TN and P=0.019 for TH).

The method adopted is classified by EPA as semi-quantitative (Schumacker, \n\n2002). One of the problems of this method is the loss of carbonate carbon, to which \n\ncarbonate soils are especially prone. Estarreja soils are not carbonated soils and in \n\naddition in soils with a pHCa less than 6.5 the presence of carbonates is unlikely (ISO, \n\n1995b). Moreover, as temperature was kept below 440 \u00baC, even if inorganic carbonates \n\nwere present they would not be decomposed. In what concerns the loss of structural \n\nwater from clay minerals, that can result in an overestimation of OM content (Schumacker, \n\n2002), it is not expected to interfere with results as Estarreja samples have low clay \n\ncontent.  \n\nThe calculation of the soils organic carbon (OC) from LOI is widely based on the \n\nassumption that a constant fraction of the dry LOI is OC (58%). However the use of such \n\nuniversal conversion factor may be linked to redundancy arising from various sources of \n\nerror related to the nature or age of SOM (Westman et al., 2006). Estarreja soils are not \n\ncarbonated and therefore TC can be considered equal to OC. Pearson correlation \n\nbetween SOM and TC, in SF layer, was found to be 0.862 (p<0.05), meaning that the \n\nproportion of OC in SOM increases with the quantity of SOM (OC=0.46*SOM). For SB \n\nlayer results were quite similar (Pearson correlation of 0.862 and the equation was \n\nOC=0.41*SOM). These results are in accordance with the range found by Westman et al. \n\n(2006) for podzolic soils (from 0.33 to 0.59). Values of OC in SOM above 55%, common in \n\nold soils (Craft et al., 1991), were found in samples 4.RD.SF, 5RD.SF, 7.OG/RD.SF and \n\nsample 12.OG/RD.SF (Table 5.4), which are roadsides covered with grass and known to \n\nbe old. Values around 40%, which are typical of young soils with recently deposited plant \n\nmaterial (Craft et al., 1991), were found mainly in ornamental gardens and agricultural \n\nsites.  \n\nFor Estarreja samples the median value of C/N ratio was 9.5 for SF layer and 9.0 for \n\nSB layer. Values are close to 10 indicating the presence of humus, with the lowest value \n\n(Table 5.4) found in sample 23.AG.SB (C/N=2.7) and the highest in sample 4.RD.SF \n\n(C/N=13.3). Values of about 10 are common for neutral well-drained agricultural soils \n\nthrough the world, but under wetter or more poorly drained conditions and under acid \n\nconditions this ratio is higher and may be as high as 17 (Russel, 1973).  \n\nThe median percentage of total N (0.2%) is not high, being bellow the normal values in \n\nwarm humid regions of 0.3% (Tan, 1994), still some higher values were found (0.5% in \n\nsample 25.AG). These low results are in accordance with rainfall concentrations, in which \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 60  \n \n\nannual average values of N-NO3 are reported to be 0.124 mg/l and 0.104 mg/l in two \n\nstations near Estarreja, Aveiro and Albergaria respectively (Condesso de Melo, 2002). \n\nMoreover, proximity to the sea, sources of atmospheric pollution and atmospheric dust \n\n(Wild, 1993) don\u2019t seem to have some influence on the results as it should be expected.  \n\n \n\n5.3.1.3  The CEC and exchangeable bases of Estarreja soils \nCEC is a reversible process in which one mol of cation charge in solution replaces 1 mol \n\nof cation charge on the exchanger and it is measured in centimols per kilogram (cmol/kg) \n\nor in milliequivalents per 100 grams (meq/100g). The median value of 11.1 cmol/kg (Table \n\n5.6) can be considered relatively low, according to EPA classes, that defines low values \n\nthe ones bellow 12 cmol/kg and medium values between 12 and 20 cmol/kg (Boulding, \n\n1994). Considering the type of soil and the low pH values obtained for Estarreja samples, \n\nthe CEC values obtained are according to what was expected. Still, in the study area \n\nvalues ranged from 5.3 to 19.4 cmol/kg (Table 5.6 and Figure 5.7). The lowest value was \n\nfound in sample 11.RD.SF and the highest one in sample 14.PO.SF, following the same \n\npattern of OM.  \n\nResults of the exchangeable cations, including the summary statistics are shown in \n\nTable 5.6. Of the four cations Ca is the most abundant, with a median value of 4.8 \n\ncmol/kg, followed by Mg (4.2 cmol/kg), then Na (0.5 cmol/kg) and at last, K with a median \n\nvalue of 0.1 cmol/kg and most of samples below detection limit. This difference between \n\nconcentrations of exchangeable cations in Estarreja samples can be easily observed in \n\nFigure 5.7 and Figure 5.8, with the former showing the concentration of all four cations in \n\neach sample.  \n\nThe typical exchangeable cations distribution in well-farmed temperate soils is 80% of \n\nCa, 15 % of Mg and Na and K together rarely more than 5% (Russel, 1973). In Estarreja, \n\nas it\u2019s possible to observe in Figure 5.8, only sample 8.OG/RD is near these percentages \n\n(67%, 28% and 5%). Samples 2.OG, 5.RD, 7.OG/RD, 9.OG/RD, 14.PO, 16.OG, 21.AG, \n\n22.AG and 26.AG have more exchangeable Mg than Ca, what is typical in soils derived \n\nfrom magnesium-rich rocks or natural leached non-calcareous soils. Sample 25 showed \n\nvery high contents of both CaExch and MgExch, being also the sample with highest CEC. \n\nThe composition of exchangeable cations (EC) depends on the composition of \n\nweatherable minerals in the soil and their rate of weathering, mineral composition of the \n\nrain water, dust blown, addition of waste, fertilizer applications, aerosols deposition and \n\nirrigation (Russel, 1973; Yong et al., 1992).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 61 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.6 \u2013 Values of CEC, exchangeable cations, exchangeable acidity and % base \nsaturation for Estarreja samples. \n\nSamples CEC (cmol/kg) \n[CaExch] \n(cmol/kg) \n\n[MgExch] \n(cmol/kg) \n\n[NaExch] \n(cmol/kg) \n\n[KExch] \n(cmol/kg) \n\nExchAcidity \n(cmol H+/kg) \n\n%Base \nSaturation \n\n01.RD 11.3 5.74 4.85 0.52 0.10 0.04 99.6 \n04.RD 17.2 5.50 4.48 0.56 0.11 6.59 61.8 \n05.RD 8.65 6.65 7.44 0.35 0.11 - - \n06.RD 18.9 6.40 4.97 0.34 BDL 7.20 61.9 \n10.RD 13.3 4.22 5.46 1.93 0.11 1.57 88.2 \n11.RD 4.47 2.80 1.91 0.32 BDL 0.24 95.6 \n03.OG/RD 16.3 10.2 8.00 0.33 BDL - - \n07.OG/RD 8.26 5.22 8.53 0.45 0.31 - - \n08.OG/RD 11.7 3.34 1.38 0.25 BDL 6.75 42.4 \n09.OG/RD 7.60 1.44 0.58 2.59 BDL 2.99 60.7 \n12.OG/RD 9.69 5.96 5.60 1.51 0.28 - - \n02.OG 16.8 6.52 7.00 0.41 BDL 2.87 82.9 \n16.OG 9.35 2.16 2.26 0.46 0.11 4.36 53.4 \n13.PO 13.0 6.74 3.69 0.74 0.10 1.69 87.0 \n14.PO 19.4 4.83 6.36 0.64 0.11 7.44 61.6 \n15.AG 14.5 4.45 2.14 0.44 0.15 7.28 49.7 \n17.AG 11.5 3.17 2.91 0.55 0.20 4.69 59.3 \n18.AG 9.60 1.76 1.91 1.71 BDL 4.22 56.0 \n19.AG 11.1 7.72 5.73 0.51 0.33 - - \n20.AG 7.83 4.78 3.85 1.17 0.10 -- - \n21.AG 8.85 1.40 2.85 0.25 BDL 4.35 50.9 \n22.AG 9.02 0.77 1.42 0.26 0.14 6.43 28.7 \n23.AG 8.75 4.32 3.17 0.61 0.23 0.42 95.2 \n24.AG 9.87 2.75 2.78 1.11 BDL 3.23 67.3 \n25.AG 19.2 16.6 10.9 0.93 0.19 - - \n26.AG 11.0 7.36 7.81 0.56 0.58 - - \n mean 11.8 5.11 4.54 0.75 0.19 4.02 66.8 \nmedian 11.1 4.81 4.17 0.54 0.14 4.29 61.7 \nst. dev 3.96 3.26 2.63 0.59 0.13 2.55 20.1 \nmax 19.4 16.6 10.9 2.59 0.58 7.44 99.6 \nmin 5.27 0.77 0.58 0.25 0.10 0.04 28.7 \nrange 14.1 15.9 10.3 2.34 0.48 7.40 70.9 \nRSD (%) 33.4 63.8 57.9 78.7 68.4 63.4 30.2 \n\nBDL= Below detection limit \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 62 \n\nKNaMgCaCEC\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nC\nm\n\nol\n/k\n\ng\n\n26\n\n9\n\n25\n\n \nFigure 5.7 - Box plots for CEC, exchangeable Ca, Mg, Na and K. with the median, the \ninterquartile range, and the outliers (between 1.5 - 3 box lengths). \n\n \n\nR\nD\n\n. 0\n1\n\nO\nG\n\n.0\n2\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n3\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n4\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n5\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n6\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n7\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n8\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n9\n\nR\nD\n\n.1\n0\n\nR\nD\n\n.1\n1\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.1\n2\n\nP\nO\n\n.1\n3\n\nP\nO\n\n.1\n4\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n5\n\nO\nG\n\n.1\n6\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n7\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n8\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n9\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n0\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n1\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n2\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n3\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n4\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n5\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n6\n\nSample\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n10\n\n30\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\nC\na\n\n, M\ng,\n\n N\na\n\n, K\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nC a\nMg\nN a\nK\n\n \nFigure 5.8 \u2013 Percentages of the exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K) in each sample. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 63 \n \n\nConcentration of exchangeable Na is high in some Estarreja samples, being the \n\nhighest value found in sample 9.OG/RD (2.59 cmol/kg). Some samples showed an \n\nexchangeable Na percentage (% of total exchangeable base content) above 15%, the \n\nthreshold above which soils are considered to be sodium-affected (sodic) (Ellis &amp; Mellor, \n\n1995). This may be happening in samples 9.OG/RD (56% of Na), 10.RD (16.5% of Na), \n\n18.AG (31.2% of Na) and 24.AG (16.7% of Na). Na is toxic to many species and it has a \n\ndeleterious effect on soil structure, because aggregation of clay particles does not occur \n\nand therefore soil particles are dispersed giving adverse physical conditions (Wild, 1993). \n\nOne explanation for these high values may be the high concentration of Na in rainwater, \n\nas the level of Na can be controlled by this factor (Russel, 1973). The local rainfall has \n\nannual averaged Na/Cl ratios of 1.21, close to the characteristic value for the seawater \n\n0.85, and reflecting marine aerosol (Condesso de Melo et al., 2002). The relative high \n\npercentage of Mg found in samples may also be an indication of a marine influence. \n\nResults may also be affected by the parent material (sand dunes) or can be influenced by \n\nfree sodium salts. Data about salinity should have been measured from the electrical \n\nconductivity, in order to determine how far this parameter is influencing the results.  \n\nIn calcareous soils, the sum of the cations (? Ca, Mg, K, and Na) is invariable equal to \n\nCEC since any deficit of the cations on the exchanger can be made up by Ca2+ ions from \n\nthe dissolution of CaCO3. In non-calcareous soil, which is the case of Estarreja, this sum \n\nis frequently lower than the CEC, being the difference referred as exchange acidity (in \n\ncmol H+/kg soil). The exchange acidity is mainly due to Al3+ ions that can be displaced by \n\nleaching with strong salt solution. In some cases the sum of exchangeable cations in \n\nEstarreja soils was found to be higher than the CEC, meaning that probably soluble salts \n\nwere present in soil samples. Therefore, a pre-wash with aqueous ethanol or glycerol \n\nshould have been made to remove soluble salts. As a result, in these samples (3.OG/RD, \n\n5.RD, 7.OG/RD, 12OG/RD, 19.AG, 20.AG, 25.AG and 26.AG) the percent of base \n\nsaturation (%BS = ?EC/CEC) is higher than 100. This way, %BS and exchangeable \n\nacidity was calculated for all samples except these ones (Table 5.6). Considering these \n\nresults, the lowest value of %BS was found in sample 22.AG (28.7%) and the highest one \n\nin sample 11.OG/RD (95.6%). For exchange acidity results ranged from 0.4 cmol H+/kg, in \n\nsample 23.AG, to 7.4 cmol H+/kg in sample 14.PO. \n\n5.3.2 Estarreja soil\u2019s texture \nThe determination of the particle size distribution (PSD) of Estarreja surface samples was \n\nperformed and the main texture percentages were obtained: sand, silt and clay fractions. \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 64 \n\nFigure 5.9 shows that the dominant fraction is sand, followed by silt and with a very low \n\npercentage the clay. Figure 5.10 shows the percentages of each fraction for individual \n\nsamples. Samples are predominantly coarse textured with sand particles exceeding 70% \n\nby weight in 13 samples. The highest total fine fraction content was 58% for sample \n\n14.PO (silt loam) and the lowest was 14% for sample 11.RD (sand). All other samples are \n\nclassified as sandy loam or loamy sand.  \n\n \n\nFineFractionClaySiltSand\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n8\n\n \n\n%\n \n\nFigure 5.9 \u2013 Box plot of the percentages of sand, silt, clay and the total fine fraction, with \nthe median, the 25th and 75th percentile and the outliers (outside the 5th and the 95th \npercentile). \n\n \nSamples were classified according to the percentages of the USDA soil texture classes \n\n(USDA - [w13]). This was achieved using the Talwin 42\u00ae classification program which \n\nclassifies the texture class of each sample according to the respective sand and fine \n\nfraction percentages. Figure 5.11 shows all 26 Estarreja surface samples, plotted in the in \n\nthe triangular diagram according with the USDA classification system. Although most of \n\nthe samples fell in the same texture class, it is possible to distinguish the four classes: \n\nsand, sandy loam, loamy sand and silt loam. The majority of Estarreja samples (16 \n\nsamples) are classified as sandy loam, eight samples are classified as loamy sand, one \n\nas silt loam and one as sandy. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 65\n\nR\nD\n\n. 0\n1\n\nO\nG\n\n.0\n2\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n3\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n4\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n5\n\nR\nD\n\n.0\n6\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n7\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n8\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.0\n9\n\nR\nD\n\n.1\n0\n\nR\nD\n\n.1\n1\n\nO\nG\n\n/R\nD\n\n.1\n2\n\nP\nO\n\n.1\n3\n\nP\nO\n\n.1\n4\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n5\n\nO\nG\n\n.1\n6\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n7\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n8\n\nA\nG\n\n.1\n9\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n0\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n1\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n2\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n3\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n4\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n5\n\nA\nG\n\n.2\n6\n\nS am ple\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n10\n\n30\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n%\n S\n\na\nnd\n\n, S\nilt\n\n, C\nla\n\ny\n\nSand\nSilt\nClay\n\n \n\nFigure 5.10 \u2013 Percentages of each fraction in individual samples. \n\n \n\nThe results of PSD in Estarreja samples can be explained by the local geology and soil \n\ntype. One of the problems associated with the light texture of soils is that the shortage of \n\nfine particles limits the formation of a strong soil structure due to the lack of aggregating \n\nagents and bridging materials between coarse grains. Texture is also responsible for the \n\nfraction of available water and in this case soils are very permeable allowing water \n\ninfiltration and drainage. According to USDA, the fraction of available water is less than \n\n0.1 for sands, loamy sands and sandy loams in which the sand is not dominated by very \n\nfine sand. For loamy sands and sandy loams in which very fine sand is the dominant sand \n\nfraction, and loams, clay loam, sandy clay loam and sandy clay is 0.1 \u2013 10.15.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 66 \n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n20\n\n30\n\n30\n\n40\n\n40\n\n50\n\n50\n\n60\n\n60\n\n70\n\n70\n\n80\n\n80\n\n90\n\n90\n\n100\n\n100\n\nsand\n\nclay\n\n1\n2\n\n34\n56\n\n7\n\n8\n\n910\n11\n\n121314\n1516 17\n\n1819\n\n20\n21\n\n22 2324\n\n25\n26\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n\nUSDA:\n1: clay\n2: silty clay\n3: silty clay loam\n4: sandy clay\n5: sandy clay loam\n6: clay l oam\n7: silt\n8: silt loam\n9: loam\n10: sand\n11: loamy sand\n12: sandy l oam\n\n \nFigure 5.11 - Texture chart for the surface Estarreja samples plotted according to the USDA \nclassification system using the Talwin42\u00ae program. \n\n \n\n5.3.3 Application of multivariated analysis to Estarreja soil\u2019s general parameters  \nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in order to identify relationships \n\nbetween the studied variables.

The second factor is \n\nloaded by the pH followed by the KExch. However CaExch and MgExch are explained by \n\nboth factors.

As it was expected \n\nsand showed a negative correlation with all this parameters. On the other hand, the pH \n\nshowed an anomalous behaviour, has it is widely know to be dependent on the OM and \n\nCEC content. However, pH showed significant positive correlations with CaExch, MgExch \n\nand KExch, explaining the position of the first two parameters in the plot of the first factor \n\nplane (Figure 5.13). Moreover, the %BS is crudely correlated with soil pH (Pearson \n\ncorrelation of 0.661, p<0.05), what is expected for mildly acid and neutral soils (Ellis &amp; \n\nMellor, 1995). In what concerns to total N, it is known that it increases with pH (Russel, \n\n1973), however any significant correlation was found. Nevertheless the highest values \n\nwere found in samples 25.AG.SF and 23.AG.SB, which have a high pH value.  \n\nDistribution of factor-scores, indicating the relative strength of the first factor (explained \n\nvariance of 46.52%) in each sample is given in Figure 5.16. The positive anomalies on the \n\nfirst factor score map (Figure 5.16) indicate the high contribution of OM, CEC, TCNH, silt, \n\nCaExch and MgExch. Samples in which these parameters are having a highest \n\ncontribution are sample 6.RD, 14.PO and 25.AG. The negative anomalies represent \n\nsamples that have a high contribution of sand and they seem to have a similar distribution \n\nover the study area. On the other hand the positive anomalies are located mainly in the \n\ncity centre. Distribution of factor scores of the second factor is not shown as the \n\ndistribution was found to be similar over the study area, indicating that the high content in \n\nMgExch, CaExch and KExch is a characteristic of most Estarreja soils. \n\nThese results, together with the scatter of all sampling points plotted on the first \n\nfactorial plane (Figure 5.17), turn it possible to extract some conclusions about \n\ncharacteristics of each sample. It can be highlighted the position of sample 11.RD, which \n\nhas very specific characteristics, being classified as sandy, with a neutral pH and very low \n\ncontent of OM, TCNH, CEC and exchangeable cations. Sample 14.PO and 25.AG are \n\nplotted in opposite sides, and also isolated from the others. This fact is due to differences \n\nin the texture, as sample 14.PO is classified as silt loam and sample 25.AG as sandy \n\nloam (however, very close to be classified as loam, Figure 5.11). Both samples have very \n\nhigh contents of OM, TCNH and CEC however sample 25 is neutral with higher content of \n\nexchangeable cations and probably soluble salts (Table 5.6) and on the other hand \n\nsample 14 is acidic, with lower content on exchangeable cations. These differences \n\nexplain that they are separated by the second factor, responsible for the pH and KExch.  \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 70 \n\nSample 26.AG and 9.OG/RD, are plotted in opposite sides (Figure 5.17), mainly due to \n\nthe neutral pH and highest value of KExch (and other cations) in sample 26.AG and the \n\nacidity and low KExch (bellow detection limit) for sample 9.OG/RD. These samples are \n\nseparated by the first factor and, as OM and CEC are low for both, the major difference is \n\nTN and in the content of exchangeable cations, being the value of TN for sample 26 one \n\nof the highest found (Table 5.4 and Figure 5.6). In what concerns the exchangeable \n\ncations, sample 9.OG/RD has very low concentration of Ca and Mg, but the highest value \n\nof Na (Figure 5.8 and Table 5.6). Samples 22.AG and 18.AG, that shows low values of \n\nexchangeable cations and low pH, form a cluster with sample 9.RD. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.16 \u2013 Plot of factor scores for the first factor (OM, CEC, TCNH, silt, CaExch, MgExch \nin opposition to sand). \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 71\n\nThe ratio C/N is explained only by the third factor (10.36% of explained variance), in \n\nopposition to NaExch. The scatter of sampling points plotted on the second factorial plane \n\nis shown in Figure 5.18. Sample 26.AG, as for the first factorial plan is isolated from all \n\nothers, being in this case due to the low value of C/N. Samples 9.OG/RD, 10.RD, 18.AG \n\nand 24.AG have a C/N ratio close to 10, but they have high percentages of Na, being \n\nclassified as sodic samples. In Figure 5.18 it\u2019s possible to see that they form a cluster, \n\nhowever sample 10 is separated by the fist factor due to its highest content in OM. \n\nAnother group can be easily identified, which is formed by samples 2.OG, 3.OG/RD, 4.RD \n\nand 6.RD. All these samples have C/N ratios equal or higher than 10 and OM content \n\nnear or above the median. No correlation or association was found between the pH and \n\nC/N ratio, however the lowest value of C/N ratio was found in sample 23.AG.SB that has a \n\npH value of 7.2, the same pattern was found for sample 26.AG.  \n\n \n\n01.RD\n\n02.OG\n\n03.OG/RD\n\n04.RD\n\n05.RD\n\n06.RD\n\n07.OG/RD\n\n08.OG/RD\n\n09.OG/RD\n\n10.RD\n\n11.RD\n12.OG/RD\n\n13.PO\n\n14.PO\n\n15.AG\n\n16.OG\n\n17.AG\n\n18.AG\n\n19.AG\n\n20.AG\n\n21.AG\n\n22.AG\n\n23.AG\n\n24.AG\n\n25.AG\n\n26.AG\n\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10\n\nFactor 1: 46.52%\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nF\nac\n\nto\nr \n\n2:\n 1\n\n7.\n33\n\n%\n\nSandy Sandy loam/Loamy sand\n\nSilt loam\n\n \n \n\n01.RD\n\n02.OG\n\n03.OG/RD\n\n04.RD\n\n05.RD\n\n06.RD\n\n07.OG/RD\n\n08.OG/RD\n\n09.OG/RD\n\n10.RD\n\n11.RD\n12.OG/RD\n\n13.PO\n\n14.PO\n\n15.AG\n\n16.OG\n\n17.AG\n\n18.AG\n\n19.AG\n\n20.AG\n\n21.AG\n\n22.AG\n\n23.AG\n\n24.AG\n\n25.AG\n\n26.AG\n\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFactor 1: 46.52%\n\nF\nac\n\nto\nr \n\n2:\n 1\n\n7.\n33\n\n%\n\nSandy Sandy loam/Loamy sand\n\n01.RD\n\n02.OG\n\n03.OG/RD\n\n04.RD\n\n05.RD\n\n06.RD\n\n07.OG/RD\n\n08.OG/RD\n\n09.OG/RD\n\n10.RD\n\n11.RD\n12.OG/RD\n\n13.PO\n\n14.PO\n\n15.AG\n\n16.OG\n\n17.AG\n\n18.AG\n\n19.AG\n\n20.AG\n\n21.AG\n\n22.AG\n\n23.AG\n\n24.AG\n\n25.AG\n\n26.AG\n\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSandy Sandy loam/Loamy sand\n\nCity centre \nsamples \n\nF\nac\n\nto\nr \n\n2:\n 1\n\n7.\n33\n\n%\n\nSilt loam\n\nFactor 1: 46.52%  \n\nFigure 5.17 \u2013 Scatter of all sampling points plotted on the first factorial plane. \n\n \n\nThe fourth factor is the only one that explains the clay parameter but it also explains, in \n\nopposition to this one, the NaExch and KExch.

Thus, heavy-textured soils (high \n\ncontents of clay) have higher organic matter contents than loamy soils, which in turn have \n\nhigher organic matter contents than sandy soils (Stevenson, 1982). In Estarreja most of \n\nsoils sampled showed textures between loamy sand or sandy loam, resulting in a medium \n\nvalue of overall OM and CEC contents. Retention of substances may also be affected by \n\nthe type of clay mineral present, although this was not studied.  \n\nOne of the problems associated with sandy soils is that the shortage of fine particles \n\nlimits the formation of a strong soil structure due to the lack of aggregating agents and \n\nbridging materials between coarse grains. The lack of organic matter will intensify this \n\nproblem and soils fail to develop the granular or crumb structures normally developed in \n\nnatural and agricultural topsoil (Jim, 1998), being example samples 11.RD, 18.AG and \n\n22.AG. On the other hand, in soils with low clay content, an increase in SOM improves \n\naggregation of soil particles, resulting in the development of stable soil structures \n\n(Huinink, 1998). It also increases the CEC, the water holding capacity, the soil\u2019s nutrient \n\ncontent, especially N and S, affecting the fertility (Tan, 1994). In this study two cases of \n\nthe texture influence on other soil properties can be addressed. The first one is sample \n\n14, classified as silt loam, shows the highest percentage of OM, low pH, high % of TN, \n\nTC, TH and high CEC and exchangeable acidity as it was expected according to the \n\ntexture. The second one is sample 11 which results are according to the expected in what \n\nconcerns the texture (sand): high pH, the lowest % of OM, TN, TC and TH, the lowest \n\nCEC and exchangeable acidity and a percent base saturation of 95.5 %.  \n\nAnother important parameter affecting soils properties is soil pH. One of the main \n\nfunctions of soil is its buffering capacity of pH due to several properties (Wild, 1993): \n\nreactions of acids with calcium and magnesium carbonates; cation exchange; proton \n\nadsorption by clay minerals, humus, and hydrated aluminium and iron oxides; proton \n\nadsorption by aluminium ions; solubilization of soil minerals. As a result of soil\u2019s \n\nacidification their capacity to adsorb cations is reduced and nutrient cations, especially Ca \n\nand Mg, pass into solution and are leached in drainage water and the basic cations are \n\nreplaced by protons and aluminium ions. If the basic cations losses are uptake by plants \n\nthey can be returned to soil in litter or on the death of plants. C/N is an estimation of \n\nhumus and humus is a source of exchangeable ions, therefore if there are no basic \n\ncations sufficient enough to balance the negative charge of humus the pH will decease \n\n(Wild, 1993). Another important implication of soil\u2019s pH is on the activity of micro-\n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 74  \n \n\norganisms, that is responsible for breaking down organic matter and most chemical \n\ntransformations in the soil, but the pH must be favourable for microbial activity which is not \n\nobserved in most of Estarreja soils. In this way, pH is an important parameter to be \n\nmeasured in all quality assessment studies. \n\nFrom the PCA results it can be defined a minimum data set of parameters to be \n\ndetermined in environmental quality assessments. In this case, and having in account the \n\nmore important parameters affecting each factor, the following can be selected: pH, \n\ntexture and TCNH. The parameters analysed are more or less related between them, \n\nbeing the texture probably the most important one affecting OM and CEC. The pH results \n\ncan be an indication of base saturation, however in soils under marine influence Na can \n\nbe at anomalous concentrations. From the Total C, N and H results, which are very simple \n\nto determine, it\u2019s possible to have an estimation of OM (for non carbonated soils) and C/N \n\nratio. However, the relationship between OM and organic carbon is not equal in all soils, \n\nand therefore the estimation of OM by LOI, which is very simple and cheap, can be helpful \n\nand improve the data set of a quality assessment. Furthermore, the data set chosen \n\nshould depend on the study aims. For example, texture that is an indicator of other soil \n\nproperties, by itself it cannot be used to estimate the ability of soil to adsorb cations from \n\nsolution, as it depends on the mineralogy of the clay fraction as well as on the amount and \n\nnature of OM (Wild, 1993).  \n\n \n\n5.3.4 Effects of land use on indicators selected \nIn order to detect differences between land uses Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of \n\nVariance on Ranks test was performed. Table 5.8 shows the median values for each \n\nparameter by land use, the samples classified as OG/RD were now classified only as OG \n\ndue to the management that they are submitted. \n\n Parks and ornamental gardens were expected to have an accumulation of organic \n\nmatter (Schraps &amp; Baumgarten, 2000), however, analysis of variance showed that \n\ndifferences between land uses are not statistically different. Still, the median value of \n\n%OM in parks was found to be the highest (7.2%) while agricultural sites, together with \n\nOG showed the lowest median values of OM (Table 5.8). The agricultural samples also \n\nshow a smaller difference between layers, as it\u2019s possible to see by the enrichment factor \n\nobtained for each sample (Table 5.5). It is usual to find low values of organic matter in \n\nagricultural soils with crop rotation and losses are known to be more or less linear with \n\ntime, and ultimately it will reach an absolute minimum, approaching zero (Stevenson, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 75 \n \n\n1982). Moreover, the C/N ratio, that is an indication of humus, showed statistically \n\nsignificant differences (One-Way ANOVA), in surface layers, between Agricultural sites \n\nand Roadsides. Soils carrying out natural vegetation, such as forest (sample 14.PO), \n\ntypically have high humus content both because they have a higher rate of addition of OM \n\nand the soil is not disturbed. Moreover the level of OM in soils is determined by the rates \n\nof addition and oxidation of plant residues and of soil humus, topography, parent material \n\nand the age of soil (Stevenson, 1982).  \n\n \n\nTable 5.8 - General properties of the soil samples in surface layer \n(median values). \n\nParameter Land use  \n AG OG PO RD Total \n\npH(H2O) 6.2 6.2 6.0 6.2 6.1 \n\npH(CaCl2) 5.0 5.3 5.2 5.2 5.2 \n\nTC (%) 1.7 2.2 2.9 2.8 2.1 \n\nTN (%) 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.2 \n\nTH (%) 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.1 0.8 \n\nOM (%) 4.1 4.2 7.2 6.1 4.4 \n\nC/N 8.2 10 11 11 9.5 \n\nCEC(cmolc/kg) 9.9 9.7 17 12 11 \n\nCaExch(cmolc/kg) 4.3 5.2 5.8 5.6 4.8 \n\nMgExch(cmolc/kg) 2.9 5.6 5.0 4.9 4.2 \n\nNaExch(cmolc/kg) 0.6 0.5 0.7 0.7 0.5 \n\nKExch(cmolc/kg) 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.2 \n\nSand (%) 74 65 53 68 71 \n\nSilt (%) 21 30 41 28 25 \n\nClay (%)  4.3 4.3 6.0 3.9 4.3 \n\n \n\nThe median values of CEC seem to be different among land uses (Table 5.8), however \n\nno statistical difference between them were observed. The lowest median values of \n\nCaExch and MgExch were found in agricultural sites, what may be due to the removal of \n\nnutrients in harvested crops. The highest value of KExch and total N was found in an \n\nagricultural site (samples 26.AG and 25.AG), that may be an indication of sewage sludge \n\napplication. It is also known that in agricultural soils the amount of cations applied in \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 76  \n \n\nfertilisers, lime or manures to land may have some influence on the composition of \n\nexchangeable cations (Russel, 1973).  \n\nRegarding the pH values it is known that the management of soils may alter the natural \n\npH because of acid-forming nitrogen fertilizers, or removal of bases like potassium, \n\ncalcium and magnesium. However no differences were found between land uses, the \n\nlowest pH value was found an agricultural site, but also the highest one, being the low pH \n\nvalues a characteristic of all Estarreja soils.  \n\nEffects of land use in texture and the geology of area couldn\u2019t be statistically proved. \n\nAs in other cases, median values show some differences between the land uses, being \n\nthe highest one for agricultural soils and the lowest one for parks.  \n\nIn addition to this analysis, the scatter plot of sampling points on factorial plane, \n\ntogether with factor-scores map, can be an easy way to observe samples characteristics \n\nand conclude whether they are suitable for purpose or they should be subjected on any \n\nkind of management to improve their quality. For example, the low content of clay mineral \n\nallied to low C/N ratios will diminish soil physical conditions for plant growth. \n\n \n\n5.4. Conclusions \nEstarreja urban soils can be characterized as slightly acid, with medium to high contents \n\nin organic matter and total carbon, being the surface layer enriched with OM. The CEC \n\nvalues are low, and the low nutrient status turn this soils very infertile. Some samples \n\nshowed very high percentages of NaExch, probably reflecting rainwater influence. \n\nConcerning the texture, Estarreja urban soils can be classified as sandy loam or loamy \n\nsand. Therefore, a high percentage of sand seems to be a natural feature of the studied \n\narea, however inner the city centre, which are mainly ornamental gardens, there is a slight \n\ndifference, probably due to the introduction of foreign soils.  \n\n Physical characteristics of samples seem to be an important factor that influences other \n\nsoil parameters. The presence of samples with very different texture classes, sandy and \n\nsilt loam can reflect the impact of this parameter in OM and CEC content. Moreover, \n\ngeneral parameters characterized were in accordance with the expected results due to \n\nsoil type and management practices.  \n\nThe pH is also an indicator that can influence other soil parameters, even that in this \n\nstudy this relationship was not so evident, probably because there is a low variability of pH \n\nin the set of sampling sites. The pH is especially important in what concerns nutrients \n\navailability and the solubility of potentially toxic metals. Soils from Estarreja are also \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 77 \n \n\nknown to have high permeability, representing a threat for aquifers or surface streams, as \n\nsoils cannot perform their role as sink of pollutants.  \n\n From the PCA results a minimum data set of parameters for environmental quality \n\nassessments can be selected: the pH, texture and Total C and N. Moreover, soil texture is \n\nan important property from which many other soil parameters can be estimated or \n\ninferred. However, used alone it can have limited predictive values, depending on the \n\npurpose. In addition, CEC is also important because of nutrients availability and indication \n\nof the buffer capacity of soil. \n\n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 78  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 79 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6.

Introduction \nTrace elements are introduced into soil from both natural and anthropogenic sources. \n\nMajor and trace elements in parent rocks may be included in the formed soil fractions or \n\nby atmospheric deposition of particles emitted from natural sources such as forest fires, \n\nvolcanic activity and biogenic emissions (Alloway, 1995; Guven\u00e7 et al., 2003). However, \n\nanthropogenic activities disturb the natural distribution of elements in soils.  \n\n Agriculture is one of the most important sources of metals in soils (especially Pb, Cd, \n\nZn and Hg), by application of pesticides, fertilizers, sewage sludge or due to irrigation \n\nwater taken from polluted streams (Wild, 1993; Alloway, 1995). Potentially toxic metals \n\n(PTM), mainly Hg, Cu, Zn and Cd, are also commonly found in soils of areas where ore \n\nextraction and smelting occurred (Alloway, 1995). Domestic waste disposal, motorways \n\nand urban areas are other important sources of PTM in the environment (Koeleman et al., \n\n1999; Bityuoka et al., 2000, Norra &amp; St\u00fcben, 2003), being in the last case the deposition \n\nof atmospheric particles over the years of major importance. There are also many studies \n\nshowing the enrichment of heavy metals in soils around industrial sites (Bityukova et al., \n\n2000; Peltola &amp; \u00c5str\u00f6m, 2003). For example, steel industry is the main source of Cr and \n\nNi, the manufacture of batteries of Cd and Pb and zinc plating factories of Zn. Emissions \n\nfrom chlor-alkali industry were during decades one of the major sources of Hg into the \n\nenvironment, however the development of new technology resulted in a decrease of \n\nemissions. Other important uses of metals include (Wild, 1993; Tan, 1994): pigment paints \n\n(Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg), for covering electrical cables (Pb), manufacture of plastics, glasses and \n\nglazes (Pb, Cd), as a filter in rubber and tyres (Zn), metal coating and alloys (Zn, Cd) and \n\nbatteries (Zn, Cd). Hg has also been widely used for making thermometers, vapour and \n\nfluorescence lamps (Tan, 1994).  \n\nPTM may exist in soil in a number of forms including as adsorbed cations, attached to \n\nclay aluminosilicates and humus colloids, oxides of Fe, Mn and Al and organo-metallic \n\nchelates (Wild, 1993). Mobility of elements in soil is largely controlled by their solubility in \n\nwater (Barradas et. al., 1992). Furthermore, bioavailability to plants depends on a number \n\nof soil characteristics, particularly cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, organic matter \n\ncontent (OM), speciation of elements and the interdependence effects of other metals \n\n(Vangrosveld et al., 1996). Moreover they enter the food chain either through water \n\nsupplies and aquatic organisms, or through agriculture products and grazing animals. In \n\naddition, PTM have long residence time in soils. The effects of PTM in soils on human \n\nhealth are unclear, and it\u2019s therefore difficult to establish threshold concentrations above \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 82  \n \n\nwhich toxic problems are likely to occur. For example, Cd it is known to cause renal and \n\ntesticular damage and Pb is implicated in causing liver damage (Tan, 1994). Mercury is \n\none of the most important pollutants, due to its toxicity to man and many higher animals \n\nand the predisposition to accumulate in different environments (bioconcentration potential) \n\n(Lindberg, 1998; Manta et al., 2002). Nerveless, some metals such as Cu, Mn and Zn are \n\nmicronutrients which are essential in small amounts for plant and animal life, but due to \n\nhuman activities or natural causes they can be present in anomalous concentrations and \n\nmay become toxic (Ellis &amp; Mellor, 1995). \n\nThis chapter aims to assess the quality of urban soils from Estarreja, by using PTM as \n\nindicators, and therefore discriminate natural and anthropic contributions as well as point \n\nand non-point sources of contamination. The pseudo-total content of PTM was chosen as \n\nindicator because it provides more useful information than a total analysis as residual \n\ncomponents are usually less available and therefore pose a little threat to the \n\nenvironment. At the end it will be identified the main factors controlling metals distribution \n\nin soils (natural causes, industry, traffic).  \n \n\n6.2. Methodology \nConcentrations of eight potentially toxic metals (Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cr, Fe and Mn) were \n\ndetermined using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (Model GBC series 906 AA) after \n\ndigestion with Aqua Regia. One gram of sample (weighed to the nearest 0.001 g) was \n\ndigested with Aqua Regia (3 ml hydrochloric acid, 37% + 1 ml nitric acid, 65%) in a Teflon \n\nbaker. The mixture was gently heated on a hotplate at 100\u00b0C until dryness. After this, 10 \n\nml of HNO3 4N were added to the Teflon vessels and the solution was transferred to a 25 \n\nml volumetric flask and made up to volume with demineralised water. Solutions were \n\ncentrifuged (5min at 4000 rpm) and filtrated by means of MN 640 filter papers to 50 ml \n\nPVC flasks. When it was necessary, dilutions were made by adding 9 ml of HNO3 4N to 1 \n\nml of solution.  \n\nThe determination of total Hg concentrations was performed by pyrolysis atomic \n\nabsorption spectrometry with gold amalgamation (LECO model AMA-254), being the \n\nanalyses performed directly on soil samples.  \n\nDeterminations of all metals were undertaken in the&lt;150 ?m fraction for both surfaces \n\nin a total of 50 samples. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 83 \n \n\n6.2.1 Quality control \nFor the determination of potentially toxic metals, the instrument was calibrated with five \n\nacidified standards and a standard was analyzed every ten samples to check for \n\ninstrument drift. The calibration series used ranged from 0.25 to 5 mg/l for Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, \n\nMn and Ni, from 2.5 to 50 mg/l for Fe and from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/l for Cd. The calibration \n\nsolutions were prepared in the same extraction solution as the samples in order to remove \n\nthe matrix effect. Detection limits were estimated from the calibration curve as the \n\nconcentration giving a blank signal, plus three standard deviations of the blank. Table 6.1 \n\nshows the limits of detection (LOD) and percent recoveries of certified reference material \n\nfor each metal analysed. \n\nFor quality assurance 3 replicate blanks were analysed and results were bellow \n\ndetection limit for all parameters. Precision was evaluated by calculating variation \n\nbetween duplicate analyses, therefore 10% of samples were digested and analysed in \n\nduplicate being the relative standard deviation (RSD) bellow 10% for all replicates. All \n\nmercury determinations were made in duplicate and RSD was also bellow 10 % for all \n\nreplicates. \n\nTwo reference materials were used: BCR 141R, calcareous loam soil and BCR 142R, \n\nlight sandy soil. Reference materials were subject to Aqua Regia digestion, except for \n\nmercury, following the same procedure of samples.  \n \n\nTable 6.1 \u2013 Limits of detection (LOD) and recovery (%) for the nine PTM analysed. \n\n CRM 141 CRM142 \n \n\nLOD \nRecovery (%) STD (%) Recovery (%) STD (%) \n\nZn 0.10 mg/l 102 3 93 5 \nPb 0.14 mg/l 104 3 107 7 \nCd 0.01 mg/l 93 1 - - \nNi 0.10 mg/l 93 5 91 1 \nCu 0.11 mg/l 92 1 95 0.5 \nMn 0.22 mg/l 88 2 84 3 \nCr 0.16 mg/l - - 81 5 \nHg 0.01 ng 96 2 96 3 \nFe 1.96 mg/l - - - - \n\n \n6.3. Results and Discussion \n6.3.1 Concentrations of potentially toxic metals in Estarreja urban soils \nResults of PTM concentration in each sample, together with histograms and results of the \n\nnormality test Kolmogorov-Smirnov are shown in Annex IV. By performing the normality \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 84  \n \n\ntest it was possible to conclude that Pb, Ni, Cd, Mn, Cr (in SB layer) and Fe (in the SB \n\nlayer) have a normal distribution, and when looking to values of mean, median and \n\nskewness (Table 6.2), they seem to be uniformly distributed over the study area. On the \n\nother hand, Cu, Zn, Hg, Cr (in SF layer) and Fe (in the SF layer) do not have a normal \n\ndistribution. This, together with other properties like high standard deviations, positive \n\nskewness and median values much lower than the mean, are characteristics that can be \n\nqualitative indicators of an anthropogenic origin of these elements (Guven\u00e7 et al., 2003). \n\nMercury is the most evident case suggesting anthropogenic sources, with the highest \n\ncoefficient of variation and with three extreme values, being this element one of the most \n\nimportant problems of the studied area. Zn and Cu also show differences over 15 times \n\nbetween minimum and maximum concentrations and values extend far beyond the \n\nmedian. By observing Figure 6.1, which shows the box plots obtained for each element in \n\nboth layers, it\u2019s possible to observe the differences between elements concentration, the \n\ndispersion of results (with the outlier values and extreme values) and differences between \n\nlayers.  \n\nMedian values were found to be similar for surface (SF) and subsurface layers (SB) for \n\nall metals, but slightly higher values were found in the SF layer for Zn, Cr and Mn. A t-test, \n\nfor Mn, Pb, or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, for Fe, Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu and Hg, was \n\nperformed and in all cases it was not found any statistically significant difference between \n\nthe two layers. Differences between layers for each individual sampling site can be \n\nobserved in Figure 6.2, Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4. \n\nZn showed a median value of 59.3 mg/kg for SF layer and 47.6 mg/kg for SB layer. \n\nThe minimum value was found in sample 11.RD.SB (15.41 mg/kg) and the maximum \n\nvalue was found in sample 14.PO.SF (284 mg/kg in SB). Moreover, samples 11.RD and \n\n14.PO were the samples showing, respectively, the lowest and the highest concentration \n\nof all metals. \n\nIn what concerns Cd, most of results were bellow detection limit being quantified only \n\n15 samples. The median values were 0.61 and 0.51 mg/kg for SF and SB layers, \n\nrespectively, being the minimum concentration 0.20 mg/kg, found in sample 15.AG.SF \n\nand the maximum 1.73 mg/kg, found in sample 10.RD.SF.

Batista et al., (2002) \n\nfound similar median total concentrations around the industrial area (16 mg/kg of Cu, 48 \n\nmg/kg of Pb, 84 mg/ kg of Zn, 21 mg/kg of Ni and 20 mg/kg of Cr). Barradas (1992) \n\nconcluded that Pb, Zn and Cu have an anthropogenic origin, being the background \n\nestimated of 20 mg/kg for Cu, 60 mg/kg for Pb and 130 mg/kg for Zn. Figure 6.3 shows \n\nwhich samples are above the background estimated for these metals, being Cu the most \n\nproblematic element, with many samples above this value, and for Zn and Pb only a few \n\nsamples are above the background. In order to estimate the enrichment of the city with \n\nrespect to the background estimated for these metals, a Pollution Index (PI=mean \n\nEstarreja/mean background) were calculated. Only Cu showed a value higher than one, \n\nbeing the ratio for this metal 2.14.  \n\n

13.PO) to 4.53 \n\nmg/kg (sample 25.AG.SF). These values are lower than the ones found in previous \n\nstudies of soils in the vicinity of the chemical complex (within an area of 10x6 km2), where \n\na median value of 0.59 mg/kg was found, ranging from 0.12 to 49 mg/kg. However, the \n\nhighest values were found near the complex and lowest values (lower than 0.59 mg/kg) \n\nwere observed in more distant areas, being comparable with the ones found in this study \n\n(In\u00e1cio et al., 1998). On the other hand, concentrations of Hg in Estarreja are higher than \n\nconcentrations found in Aveiro urban area, a bigger town (73 5000 inhabitants) 15 km \n\naway from Estarreja, were a median value of 0.09 mg/kg, ranging from 0.01 to 0.6, was \n\nfound (Rodrigues et al., 2006). Therefore, and considering the median concentration of Hg \n\nin Aveiro urban soils as background, the PI of Estarreja, in what concerns Hg, is 5.34. \n\nIn order to better understand the meaning of the results obtained they should be \n\ncompared with the maximum acceptable limits established and with other case-studies. \n\nWhen comparing values obtained for Estarreja with other studies its possible to conclude \n\nthat median concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cr are lower than values found in other cities \n\nlike Wolverhampton (Kelly &amp; Thornton, 1996), Tallin (Bityukova et al., 2000) or than \n\nPalermo (Manta et al., 2002) (Table 6.3). However these are bigger cities, for e.g. \n\nWolverhampton, in UK, has 175,000 inhabitants and Estarreja has only 28,000 in the \n\nentire municipality. On the other hand, smaller cities like Jakobstad, an industrialized town \n\nwith 20,000 inhabitants in west Finland where topsoil samples were found to be enriched \n\nin most elements (Peltola &amp; \u00c5str\u00f6m, 2003), showed concentrations comparable with \n\nEstarreja, which has some elements showing higher median concentrations (Table 6.3). \n\nNevertheless, the range of results is in general much higher in other cities than for \n\nEstarreja showing the existence of few hotspots or point sources of pollution.  \n\nMercury in Estarreja seems to be the most problematic pollutant, especially when \n\ncompared with other cities. The average mercury concentration in soils over the world \n\n(Manta et al., 2002) is reported to be from 50 to 100 \u00b5g/kg, and Estarreja showed a \n\nmedian concentration two times greater than the max mean value. Moreover, \n\nconcentration of Hg in Estarreja is higher than in Berlin urban area (Birke &amp; Rauch, 2000), \n\nJacobstad (Peltola &amp; \u00c5str\u00f6m, 2003) or Antalya (Guven\u00e7 et al., 2003). Higher \n\nconcentrations are reported in soils from urban locations like Palermo (Manta et al., 2002) \n\nand close to sources of Hg pollution (smelting, mining, coal burning facilities, chloralkali \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 91 \n \n\nindustry, etc). For example, Bernaus et al. (2006) reported values as high as 1150 mg/kg \n\nin the surroundings of a chlor-alkali plant in the Netherlands.  \n\nNevertheless, concentrations of PTM will be dependent of pedo-lithological conditions, \n\nbeing difficult to compare with other locals with different parent materials. For example, \n\nbackground levels of lead are reported to be less 100 mg/kg in uncontaminated soils (in \n\nBritain) (Ellis &amp; Mellor, 1995), however the mean ranges from soils over the world are from \n\n22 to 44 mg/kg (Manta et al., 2002), and in France the reference values are 31 mg/kg. In \n\nthe particular case of Estarreja, were the underlaying rocks are mainly sandy rocks, it is \n\nexpected very low levels of trace elements as result of dissolution and chemical \n\nweathering (Bityokova et al., 2000). Other problems when comparing studies may be \n\ndifferences in sample collection or determination methods (e.g. total vs. pseudo-total \n\ncontent).  \n\n \nTable 6.3 \u2013 Concentration of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cd, Mn and Hg in Estarreja urban soils, \nvalues from other cities and reference vales for comparison (median values unless when \nmentioned). \n\n \nCu \n\n(mg/kg) \nZn \n\n(mg/kg)\nPb \n\n(mg/kg)\nCr \n\n(mg/kg)\nNi \n\n(mg/kg)\nCd \n\n(mg/kg) \nMn \n\n(mg/kg) \nHg \n\n(\u00b5g/kg)\n\nEstarreja 28 59 35 15 9 0.6 146 200 \n\nTallin, Estonia1* 35 114 50 33 15 - 320 - \n\nJakobstad2* 22 82 59 23 7.9 0.25 209 93 \n\nBerlin3 31.2 129 76.6 25.1 7.7 0.35 - 190 \n\nWolverhampton, UK \n(mean values)4 62 231 106 - - 0.8 - - \n\nRichmond, UK \n(mean values) 4 30 108 158 - -&lt;0.2 - - \n\nAntalya, Turkey5* 44 189 36.5 190 81.5 1.33 880 90 \n\nPalermo, Italy6 63 138 202     680 \n\nReference values \nfrom France7 14 66 31 - - 0.28 - - \n\nSoils over the world \n(mean ranges)6 13-24 45-100 22-44 12-83 12-34 0.37-0.78 270-525 50-100\n\n1Bityukova et al., 2000; 2Peltola &amp; \u00c5str\u00f6m, 2003; 3Birke &amp; Rauch, 2000; 4Kelly &amp; Thornton, 1996; 5Guven\u00e7 \net al., 2003; 6Manta et al., 2002; 7Baize &amp; Sterckeman, 2001. *Total content. \n \n\nIn Portugal there are only guidelines for agricultural soils, but for example guideline \n\nvalues for Qu\u00e9bec and for Italy may be used, as they are both specific for residential and \n\nrecreational soils.

As differences \n\nbetween layers were not significant only SF were used in the PCA. Concentrations \n\nobtained from chemical analysis of the 9 elements were log transformed, as not all \n\nelements showed a normal distribution, and therefore the initial matrix was constituted by \n\n26 individuals and 9 variables. In this way, the eigenvalues, extracted by PCA for log data, \n\nare presented in Figure 6.5.

Hg is also explained by axis 2, being even more important. In \n\nFigure 6.6 it\u2019s possible to observe the association between the variables Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, \n\nMn and Fe. These are typical lithogenic elements (except Cu), probably associated to the \n\nlocal geology, therefore the natural sources are likely to be explained by the first factor.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.6 - Projection of the variables on the first factorial plan. \n\n \n\nThe second factor is responsible for 13.7% of the explained variance. It is loaded by \n\nHg, but Zn and Pb appear to be associated with this element. Moreover Hg only showed \n\nsignificant correlations (Pearson correlation, p<0.05) with these two elements, meaning \n\nthat the origin could be the same. It can be also observed the high correlation between \n\nZn-Pb. In addition the association between Zn, Pb, Hg in this area as been reported in \n\nprevious studies (Barradas, 1992; Batista et al., 2002). Therefore, the second factor \n\nrepresents anthropogenic component in soil, as it is loaded by a typical anthropogenic \n\nelement of Estarreja area. \n\nSpatial distribution of factor-scores for the first and second factors is given in Figure 6.7 \n\nand Figure 6.8, indicating the relative strength of both factors in each sample. The \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 95\n\nnegative anomalies on the first factor score map indicate the high contribution of factor 1, \n\nand the positive anomalies on the second map indicate the contribution of factor 2 \n\n(anthropogenic sources).  \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7 \u2013 Distribution of factor scores for the first factor for topsoils of Estarreja (Fe, Cu, \nCr, Zn, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg). \n\n \n\nAlthough factor 1 seems to represent the local geology, factor scores do not show a \n\nhomogeneous distribution over the study area as it was expected. It can be observed in \n\nFigure 6.7 two areas where negative anomalies are more evident: one near the chemical \n\ncomplex and other in the south of the study area, near the town centre. The main reason \n\nmay be that this factor is loaded by elements such as Cu, Zn, Hg and Pb that are typical \n\nanthropogenic. On the other hand, factor 2, that conceptually condenses the information \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 96 \n\nof the Hg as tracer of anthropic pollution, shows strong positive anomalies in the area \n\nunder the influence of the chemical complex (Figure 6.8). The predominance of northwest \n\nwinds can result in a dispersion of atmospheric emissions from the complex to the south \n\nor southwest of the source. However a very strong anomaly was found in sample 25.AG \n\nthat is located near the \u201cEsteiro de Estarreja\u201d, which received contaminated effluents \n\nduring decades. Moreover, Pereira et al. (1998) reported values from 49 to 340 mg/kg of \n\nHg in surface sediments of the Esteiro, being the highest levels found nearby the effluent \n\ndischarge point. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.8 - Distribution of factor scores for the second factor for topsoils of Estarreja (Hg). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 97\n\nFigure 6.9, showing the projection of the cases on the first factor-plane, help on the \n\nvisualization of factors contribution on samples distribution. Moreover it\u2019s possible to \n\ndistinguish a group of 3 samples (15.AG, 24.AG and 25.AG) which are related to the \n\nassociation formed by Hg, Pb and Zn. Although sample 25.AG shows the highest Hg \n\nconcentration, it does not have the highest positive anomaly when projecting the second \n\nfactor score (Figure 6.8) due to high concentration of other metals, especially Pb and Zn. \n\nIt is also possible to observe in Figure 6.9 the samples with higher (14.

The first one is formed by Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb, being the first four \n\nassociated with natural geology.

This behaviour may reflect the anthropogenic source of these elements as it \n\nis known that this factors control metal concentrations in soils (McMartin et al., 2002).  \n\nThe third factor is loaded by the C/N ratio in opposition to Hg.

When performing the \n\nKruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks test to each metal, in order to find \n\nstatistical differences from land uses, any difference could be proved. Despite this, Cu \n\nvalues were found to be higher in the RD samples, with a median value of 39 mg/kg. \n\nThese samples are under the influence of a very busy road that crosses Estarreja, which \n\nduring decades had high traffic intensity. The median value for AG is 23.6 mg/kg and for \nPA/OG is 45.0 mg/kg, however, excluding sample 14 this value falls to 19.8 mg/kg. Pb \n\nalso showed differences between median values for RD (38.6 mg/kg), AG (34.2 mg/kg) \n\nand OG/PA (29.8 mg/kg).

This tendency, higher PTM \n\nconcentrations in roadsides, is in accordance with other studies in urban soils (Paterson et \n\nal., 1996), however the agricultural sites in Estarreja shows very high medians of PTM \n\nconcentrations and the main reason should be that in this study agricultural sites are very \n\nclose or inside the urban area and under influence of industry. On the other hand Zn has a \n\nhigher median in AG (68.9 mg/kg) followed by RD (53.7 mg/kg). The same was observed \n\nfor Hg, due to the hotspots found that are agricultural sites and therefore the median \n\nconcentration for this land use is slightly higher than for the other land uses. \n\nTable 6.7 - Median concentrations by land use.  \n\nLand use \nParameter \n\nAG OG/PO RD \nTotal \n\nCu (mg/kg) 23.6 45.0 39.0 28.4 \nPb (mg/kg) 34.2 29.8 38.6 34.7 \nZn (mg/kg) 68.9 49.6 53.7 59.3 \nMn (mg/kg) 114.6 201.5 147.3 146.3 \n\nFe (%) 0.66 1.41 0.66 1.02 \nNi (mg/kg) 8.1 12.4 8.6 8.5 \nCr (mg/kg) 8.6 18.6 22.6 14.6 \nCd (mg/kg) 0.46 1.26 1.17 0.61 \nHg (mg/kg) 0.21 0.19 0.13 0.2 \n\n \n\nCd showed a similar distribution over the study area, with the highest concentration \n\nfound in a roadside, near the chemical complex (Figure 6.20). Moreover the highest \n\nconcentrations can be observed in samples near the main road and in samples 25.AG \n\nand 14.PO, known to be severely contaminated.  \n\nThe highest concentrations of Zn were found in samples 15.AG and 10.RD, both very \n\nclose to the chemical complex (Figure 6.21). In addition both samples showed an \n\nenrichment factor of SF in relation to SB layer higher than 1.5, indicating an atmospheric \n\ndeposition of Zn. Also sample 14.PO, has high concentration of this metal, as well as \n\nsample 25.AG, the one near the Esteiro of Estarreja. In fact, sample 14.PO shows the \n\nhighest levels for all metals, except Hg, being the main source of pollution the river Antu\u00e3 \n\nthat often inundate this park. Antu\u00e3 river is severely contaminated, mainly with Cu, Cr, Ni \n\nand Zn from industry situated upstream, being the discharges mainly from \n\nmetalomechanics, untreated domestic sewage and textiles (Moreno, 2000).  \n\n\n\n \n\nPage 106  \n\n \n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \nFigure 6.20\u2013 Spatial distribution of Cd in surface \nlayer of Estarreja urban soils. \n\n \nFigure 6.21\u2013 Spatial distribution of Zn in surface layer \nof Estarreja soils. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 107\n\nThe highest concentrations of Hg were found in samples near the chemical complex \n\n(sample 15.AG) or near the \u201cEsteiro the Estarreja\u201d (sample 25.AG), a channel from the \n\nRia de Aveiro lagoon where highly contaminated effluents from a chlor-alkali plant have \n\nbeen discharged from 1950\u2019s until 1994 (Figure 6.22). Also sample 24.AG showed a high \n\nconcentration of Hg, being this site near a discharge point from the chemical complex \n\nduring many years (Vala de S. Filipe). The source of Hg in sites 24.AG and 25.AG should \n\nbe different from the samples 10.RD and 15.AG, located near the complex which showed \n\nan enrichment of the SF layer, indicating the atmospheric deposition of Hg (Figure 6.3).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.22\u2013 Spatial distribution of Hg in surface layer of Estarreja soils. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\nPage 108 \n\nCu and Pb seem to be more affected by diffuse pollution as a result of atmospheric \n\ndeposition (Figure 6.23 and Figure 6.24 ). However, the Antu\u00e3 river can also be \n\nconsidered a source of these metals (sample 14.PO). In the case of Pb, other point \n\nsources can also be addressed, being them the Esteiro of Estarreja (sample 25.AG) and a \n\ngas station near samples 1.RD and 4.RD. The spatial variability of these elements can be \n\na result of different efficiency of soils samples to trap these pollutants due to their distinct \n\ncharacteristics (mainly texture). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.23 \u2013 Spatial distribution of Cu in surface layer of Estarreja urban soils. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 109\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.24 - Spatial distribution of Pb in surface layer of Estarreja urban soils. \n\n \n\nConcluding, three sources of pollution to the urban soils of Estarreja can be defined: \n\nthe Antu\u00e3 river, emission of the chemical complex and the Esteiro of Estarreja. In the first \n\ncase the discharges without any treatment is still an undergoing problem, and in the \n\nformer one it is a result of decades of discharges. However natural features of soils have \n\ninfluence on PTM distribution, being difficult to assess the influence of industrial, urban or \n\nrural activities. Moreover the sampling area should be greater enough to notice the area \n\nunder influence of pollution from the chemical complex.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n110 \n\n6.4. Conclusions \nConcentrations of potentially toxic metals in Estarreja soils are not very high, especially \n\nwhen compared with other cities. Nevertheless some sites showed high concentrations of \n\nPTMs, being some above guidelines values.  \n\nHg, Zn, Cu and Pb seem to have an anthropogenic origin. Mercury is, however, the \n\nmost evident case, especially when comparing with Aveiro and with other cities. The Hg \n\ncontamination can be both from atmospheric deposition or contaminated channels where \n\nuntreated effluents were released during decades. Cu and Pb showed highest median \n\nconcentrations in roadsides showing however a uniform distribution over the study area, \n\nindicating diffuse pollution either due to traffic or industry. Therefore, levels of PTM in \n\nEstarreja soils can be assigned to the following origins: natural causes (Fe, Ni, Cr, Mn), \n\nindustry effluents (Zn, Hg) and diffuse pollution from traffic or industry (Cu, Pb and Cd).  \n\nNevertheless, concentrations of PTM will be dependent of pedo-lithological conditions, \n\nbeing difficult to compare with other locals with different parent materials. The parent \n\nmaterial is a very important factor that will influence not only the natural concentrations but \n\nalso the soil properties itself. For all metals (both the ones with recognized natural origin \n\nand the ones with anthropogenic origin), soil characteristics that influence the efficiency to \n\ntrap and hold metals (e.g., soil texture and specially organic matter content) seem to \n\ncontrol the distribution/levels in the study area. Results seem to prove that spatial \n\nvariability of PTM levels is a very important indicator in the definition of soil quality in \n\nurban environments. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 111 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7.

Introduction \nTwo classes of compounds can be used as \u201ctracers\u201d of several activities: polycyclic \n\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyl\u2019s (PCBs). Anthropogenic \n\nactivities such as traffic, industry, domestic heating and agriculture can be major sources \n\nof these compounds. PAHs are by-products resulting from the incomplete combustion or \n\npyrolysis of organic material such as coal, gas and oil, residential heating, traffic \n\nemissions, waste discharge and internal combustion engines (Wagrowski &amp; Hites, 1997; \n\nIPCS, 1998; Mielke et al., 2001; Rost et al., 2002). Therefore, they are ubiquitous in urban \n\nenvironments and considered good markers of urban activities (Wong et al., 2004). PCBs \n\nare normally associated with industry, particularly electrical industry.  \n\nPAHs are a large group of semivolatile, chemically stable and hydrophobic organic \n\ncompounds, which have two or more fused benzenoid rings in their structure and no \n\nelements other than carbon and hydrogen (IPCS, 1998; Marce &amp; Borrull, 2000). PCBs are \n\nchlorinated hydrocarbons with a biphenyl nucleus on which one to ten of the hydrogens \n\nhave been replaced by chlorine. They were commercially produced as complex mixtures \n\nfor a variety of uses, especially for electrical industry but also used in hydraulic fluids, as \n\nplasticizers in sealants, resins, waxes and paints as well as flame retardants in lubricating \n\noils. The chemical properties that made them so useful for industry were low vapour \n\npressures, low water solubilities, low reactivity, low degradability and high dielectric \n\nconstants (Edgar et al., 1999). Unfortunately, these properties are also responsible for the \n\nPCB environmental contamination problem.  \n\nOrganic pollutants can be highly persistent in the environment, easily adsorbed to \n\nsurfaces and accumulative through the food chain. Since some of them are known or \n\nsuspected of carcinogenic and/or mutagenic activity, the fate of these compounds in the \n\nsoil environment is critical to assess their potential hazard risk (Folch et al., 1996; \n\nMachala et al., 2001). Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are transported in the \n\natmosphere over short and long distances in both gaseous and particulate forms and they \n\ntend to accumulate in soils where, due to their hydrophobicity, are likely to be retained for \n\nmany years (Motelay-Massei et al., 2004; Erickson, 1997). Dry and wet atmospheric \n\ndeposition is the main input of semi-volatile organic compounds to soil. Consequently, \n\nsoils constitute, even in the urban context, the main environmental compartment for \n\naccumulation of organic contaminants as they are particle reactive chemicals and highly \n\nlipophilic (Edgar et al., 1999; Wong et al., 2004). The contamination of the environment by \n\ntoxic organic compounds can cause chronic disruption of the biological processes within \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n114 \n\nsoil, particularly the ones related with soil organic matter dynamics which are key parts of \n\nthe carbon and nitrogen cycles. Organic contaminants are known to be strongly retained \n\nin the organic phase of a soil and although they are subject to biodegradation and \n\nphotodegradation, it is known that uptake of organics into soil organic matter can be \n\nvirtually irreversible (Yang et al., 2001). Moreover, kinetics depends on soil type, with \n\nslower rates observed for high-organic matter soil horizons (Girvin et al., 1993), being the \n\ndistribution constants for organic contaminants in soil proportional to the soil organic \n\ncarbon content (Paya-Perez et al., 1991).  \n\nFor all these reasons, the analysis of persistent organic pollutants has increasingly \n\nimportance in environmental assessments. Therefore, testing and validating methods for \n\nassessing the presence and the quantification of organic pollutants in soils is a useful and \n\nimportant tool for urban planning.  \n \n\n7.2. Methodology for determination of PAHs and PCBs  \n7.2.1 Extraction and cleanup \nThe extraction procedure was adapted from the US EPA method 3500B (USEPA, 1996b) \n\nusing a Soxhlet apparatus. Ten grams of soil (&lt;2mm fraction) were weighed and placed \n\ninside a pre-washed glass wool thimble in the extraction chamber and cleaned glass wool \n\nwas used to avoid loss of soil to the extract. Samples were extracted for 8 hours using a \n\nhigh grade hexane/acetone mixture (2:1). The extracts were concentrated to a known \n\nvolume using a rotative evaporator at 30\u00baC and preserved in hexane:acetone (2:1) at 4\u00baC \n\nin dark glass vials with Teflon seals and parafilm to avoid evaporation. Extracts were \n\nsubmitted to a neutral alumina clean-up and solvent changed to isooctane for PCBs and \n\nto dichloromethane for PAHs analysis. The dry weight was calculated and the analysed \nmass adjusted to each soil sample. Determinations were performed in the surface layer \n\nsamples. \n \n\n7.2.2 GC/MS analytical apparatus \nThis study was focused in the analysis of 19 PCBs (congeners 1, 5, 18, 31, 44, 52, 66, 87, \n\n101, 110, 138, 141, 151, 153, 170, 180, 183, 187, 206) and 16 PAHs based on the US \n\nEPA list and using a modified 8270 Method for determination. The 16 PAHs determined \n\nwere: Acenaphthene (ACE), Acenaphthylene (ACY), Anthracene (ANT), \n\nBenz(a)anthracene (BAA), Benzo(b)fluoranthene (BBF), Benzo(k)fluoranthene (BKF), \n\nBenzo(ghi)perylene (BGHI), Benzo(a)pyrene (BAP), Chrysene (CRY), \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 115 \n \n\nDibenzo(ah)anthracene (DBAH), Fluoranthene (FLA), Fluorene (FLU), Indeno(1,2,3-\n\ncd)pyrene (IND), Naphthalene (NP), Phenanthrene (PHE), Pyrene (PYR). \n\nExtracts were analysed using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection \n\n(GC/MS-QP5050A, Shimadzu Corporation), using helium as carrier gas and a DB-5 fused \n\nsilica capillary column. The detection was achieved with a mass selective detector using \n\nelectron ionization (EI) in the ion monitoring acquisition mode (SIM). The injection volume \n\nwas 1 \u00b5l and in splitless injection mode using a liner with fused silica wool to promote \n\ncomplete vaporisation and also trap non-volatile residues. Column temperature for PCBs \n\nwas programmed as follows: 40 \u00baC for 2 minutes, increased at a rate of 10 \u00baC /min until \n\n290\u00baC and kept for 8 minutes. The column flow was 0.7 ml/min. The injector temperature \n\nwas 280\u00baC and the interface temperature was 300 \u00baC. For the analysis of the 16 PAHs \n\ninjector temperature was 290\u00baC and the interface temperature was 300 \u00baC. The column \n\ntemperature was programmed as follows: 35 \u00baC for 2 minutes, increased at a rate of 10 \u00baC \n\n/min until 220\u00baC followed by 6\u00baC /min until 260\u00baC and finally at 3\u00baC /min until 300\u00baC and \n\nkept for 6 minutes. \n \n\n7.2.3 Quality control and quality assurance procedures \nFor quality control assessment two sub-samples of each soil sample were extracted in \n\nduplicate. Replicate analysis of the soil samples gave an error&lt;\u00b110%. Analysis of method \n\nblanks every tenth sample was performed to detect possible interferences from the \n\nreagents, glassware and other processing hardware.  \n\n Internal standard (ISTD) was used to check the consistency of the analytical step e.g. \n\ninjection volume, instrument sensitivity and retention times. The first two are adjusted by \n\ncalibration using the ratio of peak area compared with that for the internal standard. As \n\nretention time marker, ISTD, is used to identify and quantify the relative retention times \n\n(RRT) of unknown peaks. Relative retention time of the sample component is with 0.06 \n\nRRT units of that of the standard component. For PCBs determination the ISTD used was \n\nPCB congener 209 and for PAHs determination a deuterated PAHs mixture. ISTD was \n\nadded to each sample prior to GC-MS analysis. \n\n Concentration of each compound was determined by using an internal standard \n\nmultipoint calibration curve using five concentration levels (from 5 to 60 \u00b5g/l for PCBs and \n\nfrom 25 to 500 \u00b5g/l for PAHs).

For example, Lead et al. (1997) reported concentrations of 20 to 30 \u00b5g/kg in \n\ndifferent long term agricultural soils, 17.5 \u00b5g/kg in south Norway and 9.5 \u00b5g/kg in north \n\nNorway. It has been reported in rural and urban areas of some countries the following \n\nvalues (ISS, 2003; Covacia et al., 2001): in Belgium from 3.8 to 39.3 \u00b5g/kg (mean value of \n\n14.5); in Italia from 3.8-91.0 \u00b5g/kg (mean value of 11); in Greece a mean value of 3.5 \n\n\u00b5g/kg; and in Romania values from 1.0 to 134 \u00b5g/kg (mean value of 35.0). In Seine River \n\nBasin the sum of 7 PCBs was found to be from 0.09 \u00b5g/kg (town centre, 12,175 \n\ninhabitants) to 159 \u00b5g/kg (town centre, 8,000 inhabitants, northeast of an industrial area), \n\nboth in public gardens (Montelay-Massei et al., 2004). However Estarreja results are \n\nabove the mean value of 4 \u00b5g/kg (sum of 30 PCBs) in UK soils reported by Lead et al. \n\n(1997). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1 \u2013 Spatial distribution of PCBs (?19PCBs) in surface layer of Estarreja urban soils. \n \n\n \n120  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 121 \n \n\n Although the magnitude of values observed in many studies, the Italian legislation has \n\na limit value of PCBs in soils from residential areas/public land of 1 \u00b5g kg-1 (sum of total \n\nPCBs) what seems to be very low. In the Dutch guidelines it is established that the \n\noptimum value, given as the sum of 7 PCBs (18, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) from the \n\nEuropean Standard, is 20 \u00b5g/kg. In this case, as only six of those seven PCBs were \n\nstudied, it was considered the sum of these 6 PCBs (18, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180) and \n\nonly sample 18 was above this value. Sample 18 is an agricultural soil near the town \n\ncentre, and there is no apparent reason for this high concentration observed.  \n\n No statistical differences between land uses could be observed, however the highest \n\nmedian concentration was found in agricultural sites (10.7 \u00b5g/kg) and the lowest one in \n\nroadsides (5.4 \u00b5g/kg). \n \n\n7.3.1.1 PCB congener pattern in soil \nThe PCB profiles can give some indications about the origin and the fate of these \n\ncontaminants. Therefore, the median percentages of the individual congeners of \n\n?19PCBs were calculated (Table 7.6). In general, lower-chlorinated (<3Cl) PCBs are in \n\nless percentage than the higher\u2013chlorinated (>4Cl) ones. The profile of Estarreja is \n\ndominated by hexa-chlorinated congeners (PCBs 138, 141, 151, 153) consistent with \n\nresults in the literature for remote sites (Lead et al., 1997; Weiss et al., 2000).  \n\nIn spite of the results obtained, the industrial sites are usually characterized by \n\nhomogeneous proportions (as many light compounds as heavy ones) with slightly higher \n\nproportions of the higher molecular weight PCBs, indicating that the PCBs signature is \n\npreserved over short transport distance. The principal elimination pathway of PCBs from \n\nsoil is volatilisation (Montelay-Massei et al., 2004), with the air-soil system approaching a \n\nthermodynamic equilibrium, being this process that affects mainly the lightest congeners. \n\nWilcke et al. (1999) has concluded that, lower chlorinated PCBs become more dominant \n\nthe more distant from the sources, because of their volatility. Other studies (Wilcke et al., \n\n1999; Weiss et al., 2000) show that lower chlorinated PCBs are mainly dominant in the \n\nrural soils or remote sites. PCBs with 5 or more chlorines are quite resistant to \n\nbiodegradation, but photolysis may result in some breakdown of highly-chlorinated PCBs.  \n\nThere is a range of possible explanations for this PCB profiles (Wilcke et al., 1999) \n\nbeing in this case the most probable the age of the contamination (which determines the \n\ntime available for volatilisation) and sample treatment (as drying extracts may lead to PCB \n\nlosses, particularly of the more volatile lower chlorinated congeners). \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n122 \n\nTable 7.6 - Median percentage of PCB congeners Estarreja soils. \n\nPCB \nCongener (%) \n\nGroup \n (%) \n\n1 3.67 CB 3.67 \n5 3.56 Bi-CB 3.56 \n\n18 3.38 \n31 5.77 \n\nTri-CB 9.08 \n\n52 5.05 \n44 1.47 \n66 2.21 \n\nTetra-CB 8.25 \n\n101 2.88 \n87 1.02 \n110 1.86 \n\nPenta-CB 6.88 \n\n151 4.77 \n153 11.08 \n141 11.37 \n138 8.13 \n\nHexa-CB 36.62 \n\n187 3.13 \n183 1.29 \n180 4.51 \n170 3.51 \n\nHepta-CB 16.05 \n\n206 7.82 Octa-CB 7.82 \n \n\nPCA was performed to investigate the spatial differences and similarities of congener \n\npatterns in soil samples from different sampling sites.

In this way, the 19 eigenvalues \n\nextracted by PCA for log data are presented in Figure 7.2. Table 7.7 shows the factor \n\nloadings (with the ones higher than 0.5 marked in bold), eigenvalues and percent of \n\nvariance for the first four factors with eigenvalues higher than unit, which explain by \n\nthemselves 74% of total variance. Projections of the variables in the first factorial plan, \n\ndefined by axis 1 and 2, are shown in Figure 7.3. Projection of the cases on the first \nfactorial plan is shown in Figure 7.5. \n\nBy observing Table 7.7 and Figure 7.3, where the projection of the first factorial plan is \n\nrepresented, it\u2019s possible to conclude that the first factor its loaded by the PCB congeners \n\n138, 153, 110, 151,180, 170, 141, 87, 101, 44, 206, 52, 18, 187. On other hand, the \n\nsecond factor its loaded by the PCB congeners 31, 5, 52 in opposition to 183. The third \n\nfactor is loaded by the PCB congener 187 and the fourth factor by PCB congeners 1 and \n\n141.

In Parnu (51 800 inhab., Estonia) PYR and FLU are the most abundant in both \n\nurban and suburban surface soils, where PAHs concentrations ranged from 49 to 2540 \n\n\u00b5g/kg (Maliszewska-Kordybach, 1996) and in Rouen (579 000 inhab., France) \nconcentrations ranged from 5-292 \u00b5g/kg (Motelay-Massei et al., 2004). Typical \n\nbackground concentrations of PAHs in European remote or agricultural sites have been \n\nestimated to be approximately 100 \u00b5g/kg (Trapido, 1999). Aamot et al. (1996) found \n\nconcentrations in Norwegian surface forest soils ranging from 13 to 169 \u00b5g/kg and \n\nconcentrations in agricultural soils in Poland showed average values of 264 \u00b5g/kg \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n128 \n\n(Maliszewska-Kordybach, 1996). The accumulation of PAHs in urban soils over many \n\nyears could explain concentrations measured in the larger and older European cities \n\nwhere domestic heating and automobile traffic are the important potential sources of \n\nPAHs while in Estarreja the predominant potential source of these compounds should be \n\nindustry due to its fairly short history and a low population.  \n\nAccording to Maliszewska-Kordybach (1996) PAH classification for agricultural soils, \n\n21 samples from Estarreja can be considered as non-contaminated, since ?PAHs were \n\nbelow 200 (\u00b5g/kg soil). On the other hand samples 19.AG and 20.AG can be considered \n\nheavily contaminated since they showed a ?PAHs above 1000 (\u00b5g/kg soil). Samples \n\n3.RD, 4.RD and 17.AG are considered weakly contaminated (?PAHs between 200 and \n\n600 \u00b5g/kg). Although this classification was established for agricultural soils implying a \n\nmore sensitive use of soil it has been used previously to classify soil samples taken from \n\nindustrial and urban locations based on SumPAHs (Motelay-Massei et al., 2004).  \n\n No statistical differences between land uses could be observed, however the highest \n\nmedian concentration was found in agricultural sites (111 \u00b5g/kg with a important \n\ncontribution of the high levels of samples 19 and 20) and the lowest one in roadsides (57 \n\u00b5g/kg). \n\n \n\n7.3.2.1 PAH pattern in soil \nUsually the highest molecular weight PAHs are predominant in soils since the lighter ones \n\nare more easily biodegraded and volatilised (Wilcke et al., 1996; Blanchard et al., 2004). \nBecause of that and also due to analytical problems, NP is below the detection limit in \n\nmany samples. This compound is commonly associated with natural and not so much with \n\nanthropogenic processes (IPCS, 1998). The relative abundance of individual PAH in \n\nEstarreja soils is shown in Table 7.9, being the most abundant FLA and PYR followed by \nBBF and CRY. These PAHs are the ones usually associated with the combustion of fossil \n\nfuel and other burnable materials (IPCS, 1998) and this composition is typical for topsoil of \n\nEuropean industrialized countries (Krauss &amp; Wilcke, 2003). \n\n PAHs originating from pyrolytic processes such as fuel combustion in automobiles are \n\ncharacterized by low PHE/ANT ratios (<10). On the other hand, petrogenic PAHs, formed \n\nby the slow maturation of organic matter, typically show higher PHE/ANT ratios (>10). \n\nSimilarly, a ratio of 1 for FLA/PYR can also be indicative of pyrolytic origin of the PAHs \n\n(Wang et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2005). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 129 \n \n\n In Estarreja the median ratio for PHE/ANT was 3.17 (ranging between 1.18 to12.3) and \n\n1.16 for the ratio FLA/PYR (ranging between 0.88 to 1.53), both indicative of predominant \n\npyrolytic origin of PAH such as motor vehicle exhaust. \n\n When considering the sum of the 6 carcinogenic PAHs (BAA, BBF, BKF, BAP, DBAH \n\nand IND) according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC - [w16]), it \n\nwas observed that they represent 38% of total concentration for Estarreja samples. \n\nTherefore the contamination of PAHs in Estarreja represents a health hazard. \n\n \nTable 7.9 - Median percentages of individual PAHs in Estarreja urban soils. \n\nPAH Median % PAH Median %\n\nNP 0.7 BAA 5.5 \nACY 1.2 CRY 9.2 \nACE 1.1 BBF 11.4 \nFLU 0.5 BKF 6.5 \nPHE 6.5 BAP 6.5 \nANT 1.7 IND 6.9 \nFLA 14.8 DBAH 1.8 \nPYR 12.9 BGHI 6.7 \n\n \n\nPCA was performed to investigate the spatial differences and similarities of PAHs \n\npatterns in soil samples from different sampling sites. Concentrations obtained from \n\nchemical analysis for the 16 compounds were log transformed and therefore the 16 \n\neigenvalues extracted by PCA for log data are presented in Figure 7.7. Table 7.10 shows \n\nthe factor loadings (with the ones higher than 0.5 marked in bold), eigenvalues and \n\npercent of variance for the first two factors with eigenvalues higher than unit which explain \n\nby themselves 85.5% of total variance.

By observing the projection of variables on the first factor plan it\u2019s \n\npossible to distinguish the association between the mid to high molecular weight PAHs. \n\nAnother group can be defined as the low molecular weight PAHs (ACE, FLU, ANT and \n\nPHE).

It\u2019s evident from \n\nFigure 7.12, the projection of variables on the first factorial plan, the presence of two \ngroups separated by factor 2. The first one is formed by OM, silt and Fe and other by the \n\nPTMs together with sumPCBs. Therefore it\u2019s possible to conclude that second factor is \n\nmore likely to be related with anthropogenic pollution, as Hg and Sum of PCBs are typical \n\nanthropogenic pollutants. Moreover from the previous chapter it is known that Hg, Zn and \n\nPb are metals having influence in their distribution on Estarreja soils.  \n\nAlthough factor 1 is statistically dominant (with an explained variance of 44.5%), the \n\nfactor 2 that explains only 12.4% but condenses the information of SumPCBs and Hg as \n\ntracer of pollution. Therefore the distribution of factor-scores for the second factor is \n\nshown (Figure 7.13), indicating the relative strength of this factor in each sample. \n\nNegative anomalies represents sites were SumPCBs and Hg are having more influence, \n\nand positive anomalies samples the ratio C/N is having more importance.

Conclusions \nThe spatial distribution of PCB concentrations seems homogeneous over the sampling \n\narea, indicating diffuse pollution from atmospheric deposition. However it should be noted \n\nthat the most problematic samples are in accordance with the results of PTM (except \n\nsample 18). The PCBs levels were found to be low for an urban area, when compared \n\nwith previous studies, being the pattern more similar to the one found in remote areas \n\nwhat can indicate long term pollution.  \n\nConcentration of PAHs in Estarreja soils is comparable with soils of other European \n\ncities. Two samples were considered heavily contaminated and other two weakly \n\ncontaminated. Most abundant PAHs were FLA and PYR followed by BBF and CRY, being \nthese PAHs usually associated with the combustion of fossil fuel and other burnable \n\nmaterials (confirmed by the signature revealed by the ratio of indicative PAHs).

Moreover, the contamination of PAHs in Estarreja represents a health \n\nhazard as almost 40% of the PAHs emited are considered carcinogenic. \n\nAlthough the mixed signature of all the sources isn\u2019t clear to address with accuracy a \n\nsource of PAHs (either industry or traffic), for PCBs it was more evident the influence of \n\nindustry.

This initial assessment includes the collection of background \n\ninformation about climate, hydrology, city history and also about the social organization, \n\nas socio-economic indicators are driving forces for the formation of a city as environment. \n\nSampling is an essential step in urban soils quality assessment, and of complex \n\nplanification since they are not considered as a continuous system, being repeatedly \n\ninterrupted by roads, buildings foundations, pipes and cables. The set of indicators \n\nselected to assess urban soil quality will depend of the purpose of the study, city \n\nspecifications and analytical capabilities of the laboratory. Moreover it is necessary to \n\nkeep in mind that soil quality is a function of the intended use for the land. \n \n\n Estarreja is a small city, well known for its chemical industry; activity whose importance \n\nhas however been decreasing over the years. The area around the chemical complex and \n\nthe lagoon (Ria de Aveiro) as been subject to several studies, but none was carried out in \n\nthe urban area. In the last years population in the urban centre is increasing, therefore \n\naffecting the land consumption and anthropogenic pressures in soils, turning it important \n\nto have soil protection policies, especially in an area likely to be affected by industrial \n\npollution. \n \n\n Estarreja soils can be characterized as slightly acid, with low contents in organic matter \n\nand total carbon, and an organic matter enriched surface layer. The cation exchange \n\ncapacity values are low, and the low nutrient status turn these soils very infertile. Some \n\nsamples showed very high percentages of exchangeable Na, probably reflecting rainwater \n\ninfluence. In what regards texture, they are classified as sandy loam or loamy sand. \n\nTherefore, a high percentage of sand seems to be a natural feature of the studied area, \n\nexcept in the city centre, probably due to management practices of ornamental gardens. \n\nIn spite of this, general parameters characterized were in accordance with the expected \n\nresults due to soil type (podzols).  \n \n\nConcentrations of potentially toxic metals in Estarreja soils are, in general, not very \n\nhigh (comparing with other cities), with some sites showing values of Cu, Zn, Cd and Hg \n\nabove the guidelines. Some hypothesis about the sources and pathways could be \n\naddressed from this study: Ni, Cd, Mn, Fe and Cr probably have a geogenic origin, while \n\nPb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Hg have anthropogenic sources. Mercury is the most evident case \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n144 \n\nsuggesting an anthropogenic origin, being this element also one of the most important \n\ncontamination problems of the region. \n \n\nPCBs concentrations are low for an urban area, when compared with other urban or \n\nindustrialized areas. The spatial distribution of PCB concentrations seems homogeneous \n\nover the sampling area, indicating diffuse pollution from atmospheric deposition. It should \n\nbe noted that some of the samples with higher concentrations are in agreement with metal \n\nconcentrations. In addition, the profile of PCBs in Estarreja is dominated by hexa-\n\nchlorinated congeners which can be considered a tracer of long-term pollution.  \n \n\nConcentration of PAHs in Estarreja soils is comparable with soils of other European \n\ncities. PAHs pattern found is usually associated with the combustion of fossil fuel and \n\nother burnable materials. Samples likely to be affected by the presence of high molecular \n\nweight PAHs are mainly agricultural samples located outside the urban area but very \n\nclose to each other. However, samples affected by lighter PAHs are located inside the \n\nurban area and close to the main road. Moreover, the contamination of PAHs in Estarreja \n\nrepresents a health hazard as almost 40% of the PAH emitted are considered \n\ncarcinogenic.  \n \n\n Concerning the influence of land use on the indicators of soil quality, organic matter \n\ncontent is the parameter that seems to be more affected. In addition, Cu and Pb show \n\nhigher concentrations in roadsides, even though not statistically proved. On the other \n\nhand, Zn, Hg, PAHs and PCBs show higher concentrations in agricultural sites, probably \n\nas a result of point source contamination. Moreover the point sources of potentially toxic \n\nmetals identified were the Antu\u00e3 river, the chemical complex and the Esteiro the Estarreja.  \n \n\n The parent material is a very important factor that will influence not only the natural \n\nconcentrations of potentially toxic metals but also the soil properties itself. Moreover, \n\ngeneral parameters characterization is in accordance with the expected results for this soil \n\ntype and management practices. General properties of the soils, especially organic \n\nmatter, show an influence on potentially toxic metals distribution. However, Hg and Cd are \n\noutliers in behaviour probably due to deposition from anthropogenic sources. In addition, \n\norganic contaminants distribution is not influenced by general soil parameters. An \n\nexception is the effect of the C/N ratio in SumPCBs distribution, that also showed an \n\ninfluence in the case of Hg.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 145 \n \n\n Contributing to the control of the distribution/levels of potentially toxic metals (both \n\nthose with recognized natural origin and the ones with anthropogenic origin), natural \n\nfeatures of soils sampled (e.g., soil texture and especially organic matter content) results \n\nin some occurrences of low concentrations of most metals probably due to lixiviation of \n\nsoils resulting in contaminations of the quaternary aquifer and streams. \n\n This natural spatial variability of soils and the genesis of urban soils bring some \n\ndifficulties regarding the assessment of the soils quality, being difficult to assess whereas \n\ncontamination is due only to industry or if there is also a contribution of the urban area \n\nitself. In addition, the city size and the traffic density is expected to have a minor \n\ncontribution to the pollution levels observed. Moreover all studied area seems to be \n\naffected by pollution. A larger set of sampling sites would allow a clear perception of the \n\ninfluence of the chemical complex: samples (with similar characteristics of texture and \n\norganic matter) collected at increasing distances from this source would more accurately \n\nhighlight the importance of contamination arising from the chemical complex and the area \n\nof influence. A bigger set of sampling sites, with more samples of each land use type, \n\nwould also enable to distinguish the real influence of each type of land use on soil quality. \n\nIn the present study this influence was partially diluted by the specific characteristics of \n\neach sample.  \n \n\n In what concerns human health, the major threat is likely to be from agriculture and \n\ndust inhalation from the park near the river Antu\u00e3, with high levels of PTM, where children \n\nengage in ludic activities. Considering diet as a primary transfer pathway, it should be \n\nhighlighted that the highest levels of persistent organic pollutants were found in agriculture \n\nsites, increasing the exposure risk through the ingestion of contaminated crops. This \n\npotential health hazard is relevant attending that it was found that in Estarreja, a \n\nsignificant fraction of PAHs are carcinogenic. Furthermore, the contamination observed in \n\ntwo agricultural sites in the east side of the study area should be further investigated in \n\norder to confirm the extent of the contamination and to determine its source. \n \n\n Concluding, the set of indicators chosen can be used for a sustainable urban planning, \n\nallowing a more efficient management of resources available as well as an effective \n\ncontrol of state changes occurring in the environmental quality of urban ecosystems. \n\nMoreover they allow to take some conclusions about the aptitude of a soil to the use, if \n\nsoil is playing its role as a sink of contaminants and whereas it represents or not a hazard \n\nfor human health.  \n\n\n\nGEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n146 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS \n\n \n\n Page 147 \n \n\n9.
