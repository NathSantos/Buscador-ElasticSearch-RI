In the northeastern coast of Brazil, artificial reefs in the form of vessels have \n\nbeen deployed for recreational diving, with fishing activities being prohibited. The \n\npresent study aimed at reporting the structure and changes in the fish community \n\npresent in three recently deployed vessel reefs (Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus) as well \n\nas the colonization process on the first two, including a comparison of these three reefs \n\nwith other artificial and natural reefs, at shallow, intermediate and deeper areas, in the \n\nnortheastern coast. For this purpose, monthly dives using visual census were made in all \n\nthe three vessels, from July 2006 to July 2007. Species were categorized according to \n\ntheir trophic and spatial category and analyses were made regarding their frequency, \n\nabundance, diversity and similarity. A total of 87 species were identified in this study. \n\nThe two structurally identical and deeper vessels, Mercurius and Saveiros, showed a \n\ngreater resemblance in their community structures, regarding family composition, \n\ndiversity indices and number of species and individuals, in each trophic guild, than with \n\nthe shallower and smaller vessel, Taurus. Both the trophic and species composition of \n\nMercurius and Saveiros became more similar over time through the colonization \n\nprocess. Although the three vessel reefs point to a possible stability of the fish \n\ncommunity, Taurus presents more evidence of regulating interactions amongst species. \n\nA high similarity, >50%, was found amongst all reefs compared in this study. The results \n\nobtained showed that the vessel reefs have complete and complex fish communities. \n\nBecause these artificial reefs are creating new habitats and communities, with local \n\neconomic benefits, their use should be encouraged, with the employment of some reefs \n\nonly for diving and others, in a future context, for artisanal fisheries management. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Artificial Reef; vessel; ichthyofauna; community structure; colonization; \n\nnortheastern Brazil; recreational diving. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nA degrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos ecossistemas costeiros por press\u00f5es antropog\u00e9nicas tem \n\ntornado o uso de recifes artificiais numa ferramenta importante para o aumento de \n\nhabitats marinhos e de recursos biol\u00f3gicos. No nordeste brasileiro os recifes artificiais, \n\nespecialmente em forma de naufr\u00e1gios, t\u00eam sido utilizados para o mergulho recreativo \n\ndevido \u00e0s boas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de temperatura e visibilidade da \u00e1rea. Nesses locais, segundo \n\numa lei estadual existente desde 2001, a actividade de pesca \u00e9 completamente proibida. \n\nOs principais objectivos deste estudo s\u00e3o observar a estrutura da comunidade \n\nictiofaun\u00edstica, e suas poss\u00edveis mudan\u00e7as, presente em tr\u00eas naufr\u00e1gios afundados em \n\nMaio de 2006 (Mercurius, Saveiros e Taurus), bem como o processo de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\npara os dois deles, e ainda comparar estes tr\u00eas recifes com outros recifes naturais e \n\nartificiais, a diferentes profundidades, na costa nordeste do Brasil. Com esse intuito, \n\nforam realizados mergulhos mensais utilizando censos visuais, de Julho de 2006 a Julho \n\nde 2007. Devido \u00e0 estrutura complexa dos naufr\u00e1gios e ao reduzido tempo de mergulho \n\nfoi utilizada uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de metodologias, incluindo transectos e busca intensiva, \n\nde forma a observar e contabilizar todas as esp\u00e9cies presentes nos mesmos. As esp\u00e9cies \n\nforam separadas em categorias com base no seu comportamento tr\u00f3fico (carn\u00edvoros, \n\nomn\u00edvoros, pisc\u00edvoros, planct\u00edvoros, herb\u00edvoros territoriais, herb\u00edvoros m\u00f3veis, \n\npredadores de invertebrados s\u00e9sseis e predadores de invertebrados m\u00f3veis) e espacial \n\n(tipo A - esp\u00e9cies que preferem o contacto f\u00edsico com o recife; B - esp\u00e9cies que nadam \u00e0 \n\nvolta do recife, estando associados a este por vis\u00e3o e som; C - esp\u00e9cies que se mant\u00eam \n\nna coluna de \u00e1gua; e D - esp\u00e9cies que utilizam a \u00e1rea ao redor dos recifes), analisando-\n\nse a sua frequ\u00eancia, abund\u00e2ncia, diversidade e similaridade. Foi identificado um total de \n\n87 esp\u00e9cies neste estudo, com 82 para o Mercurius, 68 para o Saveiros e 69 para o \n\nTaurus. Os dois naufr\u00e1gios com caracter\u00edsticas mais semelhantes em termos de \n\ntamanho e profundidade, o Mercurius e o Saveiros, apresentaram uma maior \n\nsemelhan\u00e7a entre si relativamente \u00e0 composi\u00e7\u00e3o das fam\u00edlias de peixes, \u00edndices \n\nbiol\u00f3gicos e n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies e peixes encontrados em cada categoria tr\u00f3fica, do que \n\nem rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Taurus, naufr\u00e1gio com um tamanho menor e situado a uma menor \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\nprofundidade. O Mercurius e o Saveiros tamb\u00e9m mostraram, atrav\u00e9s de uma ordena\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nMDS (MultiDimensional Scaling), que a sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica e tr\u00f3fica se tornava \n\ncada vez mais semelhante ao longo do processo de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o. Os valores mais \n\nelevados de diversidade biol\u00f3gica foram encontrados nestes dois naufr\u00e1gios, com igual \n\nvalor para a diversidade de Shannon (2.83) e reduzida diferen\u00e7a para a equitabilidade de \n\nPielou (entre 0.83 e 0.82). O Taurus apresentou os menores valores para os \u00edndices \n\nbiol\u00f3gicos, com uma diversidade de 2.61 e equitabilidade de 0.76. Estes valores, \n\njuntamente com a an\u00e1lise do log da abund\u00e2ncia e percentagem de frequ\u00eancia, e do \n\nn\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies e peixes observados ao longo dos mergulhos, mostram que apesar \n\ndas comunidades j\u00e1 se apresentarem ricas e tenderem a uma estabilidade, o Taurus \n\nmostra evid\u00eancias de processos mais intensos de interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre as esp\u00e9cies, \n\nencontrando-se a sua comunidade ictiofaun\u00edstica ainda em estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o. Para as \n\nan\u00e1lises da coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o foram tamb\u00e9m utilizadas categorias de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial das \n\nesp\u00e9cies relativamente ao naufr\u00e1gio, verficando-se diferen\u00e7as no potencial de \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade entre as diversas categorias e especialmente \n\nem rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 presen\u00e7a ou n\u00e3o de mergulhadores, uma vez que um dos naufr\u00e1gios \n\ncomparados estava fechado para mergulho recreativo, servindo como controle. Foi \n\nencontrada uma forte semelhan\u00e7a (> 50%) entre todos os recifes comparados neste \n\nestudo pela an\u00e1lise de clusters, utilizando-se a lista de aus\u00eancia/ presen\u00e7a das esp\u00e9cies. \n\nCom esses dados, foi feita uma An\u00e1lise de Correspond\u00eancia que separou os locais de \n\nacordo com a sua profundidade, agrupando os rasos num grupo, todos os interm\u00e9dios, \n\nincluindo um natural, num segundo grupo e, por \u00faltimo, o recife profundo mais \n\nafastado. Ainda em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s an\u00e1lises de cluster, observaram-se diferentes resultados \n\nde agrega\u00e7\u00e3o entre os recifes consoante o tipo de dados utilizados (e. g. todas as \n\nfam\u00edlias ou s\u00f3 aquelas que mostram certo grau de depend\u00eancia do recife \u2013 \n\nAcanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae e Scaridae), \n\nnas quais o recife interm\u00e9dio natural se encontrava agrupado aos restantes recifes \n\ninterm\u00e9dios mas artificiais ou aos recifes naturais mas rasos. Os resultados obtidos \n\nneste estudo mostram que as comunidades presentes nos naufr\u00e1gios s\u00e3o caracter\u00edsticas \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n\nda costa nordeste do Brasil, tendo presentes todas as fam\u00edlias mais encontradas em \n\noutros recifes costeiros. Nesta \u00faltima compara\u00e7\u00e3o, as diferen\u00e7as observadas \n\nrelativamente aos \u00edndices de diversidade foram provavelmente influenciadas pelas \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas estruturais das \u00e1reas comparadas e pelas diferen\u00e7as de metodologia \n\nutilizada (e.g. o uso de transecto versus censo estacion\u00e1rio, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de ictiot\u00f3xico \n\ncomo \u00f3leo de cravo). Com a falta de estruturas ou relevos mais complexos na \n\nplataforma continental de Pernambuco, uma vez que esta \u00e9 essencialmente plana com \n\npoucas irregularidades at\u00e9 aos 40-50 m, o afundamento de estruturas artificiais \n\nfunciona como um o\u00e1sis, para o qual s\u00e3o atra\u00eddos peixes de \u00e1reas adjacentes. Foi \n\nobservado um aumento no n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies do local para mais 20 esp\u00e9cies em \n\nmenos de tr\u00eas meses. Pelas an\u00e1lises realizadas com a aus\u00eancia/presen\u00e7a de esp\u00e9cies foi \n\nposs\u00edvel obter um cen\u00e1rio temporal das altera\u00e7\u00f5es inerentes ao desenvolvimento das \n\ncomunidades de peixes recifais, atribuindo uma maior import\u00e2ncia \u00e0 ecologia das \n\nesp\u00e9cies do que \u00e0 din\u00e2mica da comunidade como um todo. Como consequ\u00eancia das \n\nlimita\u00e7\u00f5es intr\u00ednsecas \u00e0 compara\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes recifes neste trabalho, resultantes da \n\nescassez de bibliografia e utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de recifes artificiais no nordeste brasileiro, foi \n\nimposs\u00edvel distiguir o verdadeiro factor limitante para a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de algumas \n\nesp\u00e9cies, i.e., a profundidade ou o tipo de recife. No entanto, apesar da import\u00e2ncia \n\natribu\u00edda \u00e0 configura\u00e7\u00e3o de um recife na estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o da sua comunidade \n\nictiofaun\u00edstica, este estudo sugere a profundidade como um factor chave neste \n\nprocesso, pois as comunidades observadas nos recifes interm\u00e9dios mostraram-se mais \n\nsemelhantes entre si independentemente da localiza\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica e do tipo de recife. \n\nUma vez que os naufr\u00e1gios criaram novos habitats e comunidades de organismos, \n\ntrazendo benef\u00edcios ecol\u00f3gicos e econ\u00f3micos locais, o seu uso na costa pernambucana \n\ndever\u00e1 ser encorajado tanto para a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de locais de mergulho como, num futuro \n\npr\u00f3ximo, para a gest\u00e3o de pescas artesanais. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Recifes artificiais; naufr\u00e1gio; ictiofauna; estrutura da comunidade; \n\ncoloniza\u00e7\u00e3o; nordeste do Brasil; mergulho recreativo. \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I \n\nABSTRACT III \n\nRESUMO IV \n\nLIST OF FIGURES IX \n\nLIST OF TABLES XII \n\nINTRODUCTION 1 \n\nBACKGROUND 2 \nARTIFICIAL REEFS 3 \nARTIFICIAL REEFS AND DIVERSITY 4 \nTHE USE OF ARTIFICIAL REEFS 5 \nAIMS AND STRUCTURE OF THESIS 7 \nCONTEXT OF THE STUDY 9 \nSTUDY AREA 9 \nSAMPLING METHODOLOGY 11 \nDATA ANALYSES 13 \n\nCHAPTER 1.

Coastal systems \n\nare among the most productive and the most highly threatened in the world. With \n\nnearly 40% of the world population living within 100 kilometers of the coast, these \n\nsystems are experiencing exploitation pressures associated with population growth \n\n(Agardy &amp; Alder, 2005). As a result, the demands on coastal areas for shipping, waste \n\ndisposal, military and security uses, recreation, aquaculture, and even habitation, are \n\nincreasing and often involve the destruction of coastal forests, wetlands, coral reefs and \n\nother related habitats (Agardy &amp; Alder, 2005). \n\nCoral reefs, in tropical coastal areas, are known for their high species diversity \n\nand endemism (Sale, 1991; Lowe-McConnell, 1999) and are valued for their \n\nprovisioning, regulating and cultural services (McKinney, 1998). Reef ecosystems \n\nprovide values such as tourism, recreation, scientific research and have also great \n\nimportance at the educational, medicinal and pharmaceutical level (Ahmed et al., 2005). \n\nThese goods and services are an important source of income for local populations, with \n\ncoastal tourism and diving as the main income generating activities in some areas (Cesar \n\n&amp; Chong, 2005). \n\nOne of the most dynamic elements of the coral reef ecosystem is the fish \n\ncommunity. Its taxonomic richness, diversity in shape and habits, and behavioral and \n\ninter and intra relationships (Sale, 1991) make fish communities good indicators of the \n\nmarine environment and a very interesting class to study. \n\n As a consequence of the degradation of natural reefs, the use of artificial reefs \n\nhas became an important tool for the enhancement of habitats by increasing natural \n\nproduction of biological resources (Bohnsack &amp; Sutherland, 1985) in countries that rely \n\non marine resources as an essential economic activity (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, 2003). \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nArtificial Reefs  \n\nArtificial reefs \u2013 ARs \u2013 can be defined, according to the European Artificial Reef \n\nResearch Network (EARRN), as \u201ca submerged structure placed on the substratum \n\n(seabed) deliberately, to mimic some characteristics of a natural reef\u201d (Jensen, 1998) \n\nand that \u201cinfluence physical, biological, or socio-economic processes related to living \n\nmarine resources\u201d (Sutton &amp; Bushnell, 2007). According to this definition, structures like \n\npiers and steel jackets of oil/gas production platforms can be considered as secondary \n\nartificial reefs (Pickering et al., 1998). Other man-made structures also considered as \n\nartificial reefs are FADs \u2013 Fish Aggregating Devices \u2013 that have been extensively used, \n\nworldwide, to attract commercial and recreational pelagic fish species (Workman et al., \n\n1985). However, in this study, we will only consider bottom structures as artificial reefs.    \n\nUntil recently, artificial habitats have been widely associated with the \n\nestablishment of fishing grounds (Nakamura, 1985; Pickering et al., 1998).  However, the \n\ndeployment of ARs now includes several new purposes, such as: ecosystem \n\nconservation and management, with the prevention of trawling in seagrass meadows \n\n(Relini &amp; Relini, 1989) and mitigation of environmental impacts in seagrass beds \n\n(S\u00e1nchez-Jerez et al., 2002; Pondella et al., 2006), coral reefs (Abelson, 2006) and kelp \n\nforests (Deysher et al., 2002; Reed et al., 2006); aquaculture and marine ranching \n\n(James et al., 2007; Relini et al., 2007); biological enrichment of unproductive areas \n\n(Stephen &amp; Lindquist, 1989; Walker et al., 2002); and as a possible tool in the \n\nmanagement and augmentation of the marine ornamental industry (Wilson et al., \n\n2001). Recreational activities such as SCUBA diving (Milon, 1989; Brock, 1994; Van \n\nTreeck &amp; Schuhmacher, 1998; Stolk et al., 2007), mostly in the United States and the \n\nRed Sea, and surfing (Burgess et al., 2003), in Australia and New Zealand, are seen as \n\npotential circumstances for the use of ARs. These artificial reefs can even act like \n\ncoastline protection and marine sanctuaries (Bortone et al., 1994; Rousseau, 2006), in a \n\nsimilar way as natural reefs. \n\nWith so many different functionalities it is easy to foresee the importance of ARs \n\nand the reason why several groups and organizations linked to the use of structures \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nhave been funded. Among these are recreational and commercial fishing groups, \n\nrecreational diving groups, governments (with both agencies for fisheries management \n\nand environmental protection), researchers, and community groups (Sutton &amp; Bushnell, \n\n2007). These stakeholders have been found to have a good perception of the benefits \n\n(social, economic and environmental) that can result from the deployment of an AR \n\n(Milon, 1989; Ramos et al., 2007). One frequently used argument for the creation of \n\nartificial reefs is the positive economic impact in the local communities, through the \n\nincrease in tourism and recreational activities (e.g., Pendleton, 2005). These impacts can \n\noccur at different levels (local, regional and state) and can be measured in terms of \n\nemployment, sales, income and tax revenue (Milon et al., 2000).  \n\n In some countries, artificial reefs have been used as important elements of \n\nintegrated plans and are considered to be a good investment with long term economic \n\nand ecological returns (Santos, 1997). On the other hand, in other countries, especially \n\ndeveloping ones, in spite of the prospect for good results in terms of environmental \n\npreservation, research and resource exploitation, and besides the great interest of their \n\napplication for the resolution of coastal conflicts, the use of artificial reefs is still poorly \n\nunderstood as an efficient tool by governmental institutions responsible for the \n\nplanning and management of natural marine resources (Alencar et al., 2003).  \n\n \n\nArtificial Reefs and Diversity \n\nArtificial reefs provide appropriate substrata for a variety of epibenthic \n\norganisms including macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes. Because artificial surfaces \n\ncreate new habitats, which can differ from natural reefs in the same environmental \n\nconditions, it is important to carefully evaluate with extreme caution the negative and \n\npositive impacts of the modification on the identity and number of species within the \n\nconsidered area (Connell &amp; Glasby, 1999). Thus, the understanding of the regulating \n\nmechanisms for the abundance and distribution of the organisms can influence the \n\nimprovement of reef design, as to better mimic natural reef habitats, and if that is \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nachieved, artificial reefs can help to maintain biodiversity patterns, both locally and \n\nregionally (Bulleri, 2005). \n\nSeveral parameters have been found to influence the diversity of species and \n\ndensity of organisms in artificial reefs, such as reef design and complexity (Walsh, 1985; \n\nBrock &amp; Norris, 1989; Hixon &amp; Beets, 1989), size (Jessee et al., 1985; Anderson et al., \n\n1989; Jordan et al., 2005), material (Bailey-Brock, 1989; Nelson et al., 1994) and \n\nsurrounding substrate (Chandler et al., 1985; Coll et al., 1998), with some studies \n\ncoming to different conclusions.  \n\nOne of the main reasons for the deployment of artificial reefs is the assumed \n\nlimitation of habitat, and its importance as shelter and food source for fish species, and \n\nthis raises the main divergent point regarding the use of ARs, the \u2018Attraction versus \n\nProduction\u2019 debate (Bohnsack, 1989). While the attraction hypothesis states that ARs \n\nsimply redistribute fishes without augmenting production, and that the larger densities \n\nsometimes found in artificial reefs are the result of attraction to a new habitat, (Wilson \n\net al., 2001), the production hypothesis relies on the assumption that artificial reefs can \n\nincrease the carrying capacity in a saturated environment and, as a result, enhance the \n\nabundance of species (Bortone et al., 1994; Wilson et al., 2001). The effect that ARs will \n\nhave in the dynamics of fish communities will depend on their degree of attraction as \n\nwell as the strength of density dependence (Osenberg et al., 2002), with the most \n\nsusceptible species to a possible biomass increase being the ones that present habitat- \n\nlimited population control, reef dependency, demersal and territorial behavior \n\n(Bohnsack, 1989). \n\n \n\nThe use of Artificial Reefs \n\n  Just as reef applications vary, reef materials also differ between countries. The \n\nmost used materials are concrete, followed by natural stone and rock, offshore \n\nplatforms and FADs, tires, stabilized ash, plastic and even old structures like vessels and \n\nautomobiles (Baine, 2001). However, the deliberate use of some of these materials, \n\nsuch as platforms, vessels and tires, is one of the most controversial aspects related to \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nthe creation of ARs (Baine &amp; Side, 2003). In Europe and Japan, concrete is the preferred \n\nmaterial, whilst in Australia, Jamaica and the Philippines, tires have been successfully \n\nused as artificial reefs (Pickering et al., 1998).  \n\nRegarding vessels, several countries are sinking decommissioned ships, as \n\nartificial reefs, for the enhancement of fisheries, sport angling, diving activities and eco-\n\ntourism (Jones &amp; Welsford, 1997; Baine, 2001; Pendleton, 2005). Vessel-reefs have been \n\nsubject to several studies, such as environmental and structural influences on biological \n\ncommunities (Chandler et al., 1985; Sanders Jr. et al., 1985; Bayne &amp; Szmant, 1989; \n\nLindquist &amp; Pietrafesa, 1989), fish assemblages (Stephan &amp; Lindquist, 1989; Arena et al., \n\n2007), social, economic and environmental benefits (Pendleton, 2005; Leeworthy et al., \n\n2006) and even volunteer programs (Parnell, 2005; REEF, 2007). \n\nIn the Brazilian coast, several states have been deploying artificial reefs from the \n\n90\u2019s on. Paran\u00e1 is the state with the largest AR project with more than 2.000 concrete \n\nstructures, including anti-trawling reefs and reefs for fisheries enhancement and \n\nconservation, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo with the initial deployment, in 1997, of 100 \n\nconcrete structures and 30 made of steel, and a posterior enlargement of the project in \n\n2000, with the immersion of another 160 structures, 100 made of concrete and 60 of \n\nsteel (Alencar et al., 2003). The state of Rio de Janeiro, associated with the largest \n\nnumber of AR related scientific publications (e.g., Godoy et al., 2002; Zalmon et al., \n\n2002; Brotto et al., 2007), has used several materials from tires to concrete structures, \n\nvessels and old oil tubes (Alencar et al., 2003). In the state of Cear\u00e1, a project to aid local \n\nfisheries and also avoid the proliferation of dengue by redistributing old tires, has \n\ninstalled more than 20.000 tires in 35 artificial reefs throughout the coast of the state \n\n(Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, 2003). Another use for artificial reefs in Brazil is recreational diving, with \n\nvessel reefs being deployed in states such as Esp\u00edrito Santo and Pernambuco. In the \n\nformer, only one vessel reef (Victory-8B) has been deployed, while in Pernambuco nine \n\nvessels have been purposefully sunk.  \n\nIn Pernambuco, the first vessel deployed as an AR was Marte, in 1998, followed \n\nby Gon\u00e7alo Coelho, two years later. After that, in 2002, three vessels, Servemar X, \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nMinuano and Lupus, were deployed off the coast off Recife, followed by Servemar I, in \n\n2004 (Santos &amp; Passavante, 2007). In 2006, three decommissioned ships were donated \n\nto the AEMPE (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Empresas de Mergulho de Pernambuco), and were sunk in \n\nMay, also in Recife\u2019s coast, with the purpose of creating the Parque de Naufr\u00e1gios \n\nArtificiais de Pernambuco (PNAPE) \u2013 Pernambuco Artificial Wreck Park (Santos et al., \n\n2008). \n\n \n\nAIMS AND STRUCTURE OF THESIS \n\nFew studies have been conducted on artificial reefs on the Brazilian coast, with \n\neven fewer on vessel-like structures, resulting mostly in congress abstracts (Silva et al, \n\n2003; Miranda et al, 2004; Amaral et al., 2007). This study intends to increase the \n\nknowledge of fish communities and the biological and colonization processes on \n\nrecently deployed vessel-reefs off Recife, in the northeastern tropical coast of Brazil. \n\nRecife is the capital city of the state of Pernambuco and it is known as the \n\nBrazilian capital of shipwreck diving, with more than fifty shipwrecks along the coast. \n\nThe warm temperature and high visibility of the water makes recreational diving an \n\nimportant source of income and promotion of Recife coastal habitats attributes. The \n\ndiving facilities together with the existence of a state law 23.394/2001 (Pernambuco, \n\n2001), which prohibits spear and hook and line fishing in the vicinity of the sunken \n\nvessels, make the coast of Recife an excellent location for the development of projects \n\nand studies on biodiversity, colonization, succession, productivity and other artificial \n\nreef related subjects. \n\n A comprehensive study of the effects and benefits of an artificial reef is a long \n\nand complicated endeavor. It is a multidisciplinary work involving different areas of \n\nknowledge, from the habitat\u2019s abiotic and biological and ecological characteristics of the \n\norganisms linked to the reef, to the social and economic aspects of the deployment of \n\nan artificial reef.  \n\nThe aim of this thesis is to quantify and evaluate the changes in the fish \n\ncommunity that took place during the first year of the deployment of three derelict \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nvessels in the coast of Recife (PE), Brazil, comparing it with similar natural and artificial \n\nreefs off the northeast coast of Brazil. The specific aims of this work were divided in \n\nthree main chapters, structured as follows:  \n\n? Chapter 1 lists the fish species associated with three vessel reefs (Mercurius, \n\nSaveiros and Taurus) and aims to characterize and compare the \n\nichthyofaunal communities present on these reefs through quantitative and \n\nqualitative analyses at frequency, trophic and spatial levels;  \n\n? Chapter 2 studies the ichthyofaunal colonization and succession of two \n\nsimilar vessels, Saveiros and Mercurius, with differential usage (i.e. open VS \n\nclosed for recreational diving), by the use of trophic guilds and spatial \n\ndistribution categories. An evaluation of the visual census methodology on \n\ndifferent spatial categories is also done; \n\n? Chapter 3 compares the community of reef fishes found in several different \n\nreefs (shallow, intermediate and deep; natural and artificial) and groups \n\nspecies according to their distribution pattern. \n\n \n\nThe final items of this thesis summarize the major points highlighted in the three \n\nchapters and discuss the performance of the recently deployed vessel reefs as true \n\nreefs, at an ecological and trophic level.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nCONTEXT OF THE STUDY \n\nThis study was part of a project called PNAPE \u2013 Pernambuco  Artificial Wreck \n\nPark, in which three decommissioned tug boats (Mercurius, Saveiros e Taurus) were \n\nsunk for commercial and scientific purposes. The project was a cooperation between \n\nthe State Association of Dive Companies and two federal universities in the state of \n\nPernambuco (Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco \u2013 UFRPE, and Universidade \n\nFederal de Pernambuco \u2013 UFPE). The main objectives were to have an opportunity to \n\nstudy the colonization process of these recently deployed structures since the very \n\nbeginning, while simoultaneously promoting the diving tourism industry in Pernambuco, \n\nby creating new diving alternatives (Santos et al., 2008).  \n\nThe project was a multidisciplinary research that included the study of physical \n\n(currents), chemical (hydrology), geological (morphology and sediments), and biological \n\n(colonization and succession of benthos and ichthyofauna) characteristics related to the \n\nvessel reefs. The logistic was made possible due to the support of dive companies, in \n\nparticular Aqu\u00e1ticos which made all the arrangements for the monthly monitoring of \n\nthe three vessels during the two years of the project. \n\nThe data for this study was collected during the first year after the deployment \n\nof Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus, by a scientific group of post and undergraduate \n\nstudents, from two laboratories in the aforementioned universities (LOP \u2013 Laborat\u00f3rio \n\nde Oceanografia Pesqueira in UFRPE, and IMAT \u2013 Grupo de Ictiologia Marinha Tropical in \n\nUFPE), aiming at the study of reef fish communities and their interactions in the vessel \n\nreefs. \n\n \n\nSTUDY AREA \n\nThis study was carried out on the coast of Recife (PE) in northeastern Brazil (Fig. \n\n1). The three vessel reefs sampled were Taurus, Mercurius and Saveiros which are \n\nlocated at a distance of about 6, for the first, and 7 nautical miles from the port of \n\nRecife. Taurus (08\u00b004,193\u2019S and 034\u00b045,196\u2019W) is the closest from shore, being located \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nat a depth of 25 m, whilst Saveiros (08\u00b004,517\u2019S and 034\u00b044,327\u2019W) and Mercurius \n\n(08\u00b004,725\u2019S and 034\u00b044,022\u2019W) are near the 30 m isobath, being 700 m distant from \n\neach other. The two deeper vessels are very similar with a total length of 29 m and with \n\na vertical relief of about 10 m, with Saveiros open for recreational diving and Mercurius \n\nclosed for any activity other than research dives. Taurus is smaller, with only 26 m total \n\nlength and a vertical relief of about 8 m, which is related to its inclined bow at an angle \n\nof 25\u00ba, rather than its real height (Fig. 2). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Map of the study area and location of the vessel reefs Taurus, Mercurius and Saveiros. \n\n \n\nThe continental shelf of Pernambuco has a reduced width of about 35 km and a \n\nrelatively shallow depth, and is largely flat, from the shore to the continental slope, \n\nwhich begins at 50 or 60 m (Manso et al., 2003). \n\nThe northeastern continental shelf presents three distinct regions: a) the internal \n\nshelf (0 to 20 m), with soft slopes and regular terrain, mainly constituted by quartz sand; \n\nb) the medium shelf (20 to 40 m), with some irregularities in relief and a predominance \n\nof sand and gravel with a high percentage of calcium carbonate (>90%); and c) the \n\nexternal shelf (from 40 m on) with irregular terrain and predominance of gravel and \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nbiodetritic sand and muds, with a large abundance of Halimedas sp. and an amount of \n\ncalcium carbonate superior to 75%  (Cunha, 2004).  \n\nThe constancy of the shelf and the influence of the South Equatorial Current \n\ncontribute to the stability of environmental parameters such as salinity, temperature \n\nand water transparency, creating ideal conditions for the development of algae, \n\nespecially maerl \u2013 red coralline algae (Mabesoone et al., 1972 in Cunha, 2004). Also \n\nassociated with these carbonate rich sediments are large quantities of benthic \n\nforaminifera (Cunha, 2004) that contribute to the bioclastic portion of the substrate. \n\nThese algae, which are one of the main components of the substrate, are usually from \n\nthe genus Lithothamnium and the upper limit of their growth is related to the boundary \n\nof the terrigenous influence, at 20 m, while the lower is situated from 80 to 100 m deep. \n\nGreen algae from the genus Halimeda, Udotea and Penicillius are also an important \n\nsource for biogenic sediments of the continental shelf (Coutinho, 1976; Pereira et al., \n\n2007). \n\n \n\nSAMPLING METHODOLOGY \n\nDue to the high visibility of the coastal waters of Recife, its reduced impact on \n\nthe environment and its easy application, the visual census was chosen as the sampling \n\nmethodology for the study of the ichthyofauna. The artificial reefs were monitored \n\nmonthly with SCUBA equipment, from July 2006 to July 2007, with no dives occurring in \n\nJune due to rough sea conditions. As the vessel reefs have a complex topographical \n\nrelief and the dives are limited to 20 minutes, visual census were used with a \n\ncombination of methodologies (Watson &amp; Quinn II, 1997): transect (Brock, 1954; \n\nBuckley &amp; Hueckel, 1989) and intensive search methods (Bortone &amp; Bonhsack, 1991). \n\nAccording to Bortone et al. (1989), when there is a known area and a time limit to do a \n\nsurvey, it is advisable to sample the number of fishes by transect of a  pre-determined \n\nlength and width, counting every occurrence on both sides of the diver (Labrosse et al., \n\n2002). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Configuration of the vessel reefs, Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus with minimum and \nmaximum depths. \n\n \n\nEach sampling consisted of a team of four divers who performed the transect \n\nsurvey simultaneously, with two divers near the bottom and two at the height of the \n\ncabin, on the port and starboard sides, at a constant swimming speed. Every fish \n\noccurring in a 2 m distance on each side of the imaginary line was registered. The \n\nswimming velocity for the transect was slow, from 6 to 10m/min, and allowed sporadic \n\nstops to cautiously examine the area (Colvocoresses &amp; Acosta, 2007). Upon finishing the \n\ntransect, an intensive search was performed, in the cabin area, in an effort to minimize \n\nthe underestimation of cryptic species, which is known to be a limitation of visual \n\ncensus methodology (Brock, 1982; Hobson, 1980; Kulbicki, 1990). This intensive search \n\nconsisted in taking note of every species observed in the study area. \n\nFishes were identified to the species level, according to Carvalho-Filho (1999), \n\nHumann &amp; DeLoach (2002), and also Fishbase (www.fishbase.org), with data on the \n\nabundance being also registered. Recent changes in the classification of the Serranidae, \n\nhttp://www.fishbase.org/\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nwith the restoration of the Epinephelidae as a family, such as proposed by Craig &amp; \n\nHastings (2007), were adopted. \n\nThe data were thus collected through visual census, underwater photo and video \n\nand direct observations by the divers in 44 scuba dives, resulting in a sampling total time \n\nof 880 min (Table 1). During the dives, observations on behavior and photographic \n\nrecords for posterior confirmation of the identification of the species were made with \n\nthe use of a Sony Cybershot DSC\u2013W5 5.0 MP with MPK\u2013WA housing. The vessels were \n\nsampled on a monthly basis, with the dives always taking place between 10 am and 3 \n\npm, to maximize sunlight and visibility and to avoid the natural differences of fish \n\nactivity between day and night (Gray et al., 1998; Nagelkerken et al., 2000a; Unsworth \n\net al., 2007). \n\n \n\nDATA ANALYSES \n\n According to the different objectives of the study, the data were treated and \n\nanalyzed using a variety of different techniques and softwares, as described in the \n\nfollowing three chapters.  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nTable 1.

COMMUNITY STRUCTURE ON VESSEL REEFS OFF THE \nCOAST OF RECIFE (PE) - BRAZIL\n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n16 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nNearly 40% of the known fish species occur in tropical waters, in association with \n\ncoral reefs (Moyle &amp; Cech, 1996), which are among the world\u2019s most complex marine \n\necosystems, offering endless ecological niches and containing the most colorful and \n\ndiverse fish communities (Sale, 1991; Lowe-McConnell, 1999).  \n\nThe centre of reef fish diversity in the Atlantic is the Caribbean (Floeter &amp; \n\nGasparini, 2000), with its richness decreasing from tropical to temperate latitudes \n\n(Ebeling &amp; Hixon, 1991). The reef ichthyofauna of the southwestern Atlantic is one of \n\nthe least known (Floeter &amp; Gasparini, 2000) and only recent efforts have been \n\nundertaken to compile and describe the species and communities occurring in the \n\nBrazilian coast (Rocha et al., 1998; Floeter et al., 2003) and offshore reefs (Rosa &amp; \n\nMoura, 1997; Feitoza et al., 2003). Together with those studies, several descriptions of \n\nnew fish species, similar to the Atlantic congeners but endemic to the Brazilian coast, \n\nhave been reported (Moura, 1995; Rocha &amp; Rosa, 1999; Floeter &amp; Gasparini, 2001; \n\nMoura et al., 2001; Moura &amp; Lindeman, 2007). \n\nFishes are important elements in the reef environment, structuring communities \n\nthrough processes such as predation, competition and territoriality (Choat &amp; Bellwood, \n\n1991). As mentioned by Sale (1991), \u201ccoral reef fishes are an excellent system to work \n\nin\u201d due to the mobility, accessibility and temporal and spatial scale of processes they \n\nundergo added to their diversity of forms, habits and relationships. \n\n A guild is a group of species that exploit the same environmental resources in a \n\nsimilar way, and one advantage of the use of this concept is that it focuses on sympatric \n\nspecies that are involved in a competitive interaction, regardless of their taxonomic \n\nrelationship (Root, 1967). Because the same guild, such as feeding groups, may be \n\nrepresented in several different communities, it can be very useful in the comparative \n\nstudy of different biotopes or communities (Root, 1967). Similarly to the use of guilds, \n\nthe calculation of biological indices allows for the analysis and comparison, in a \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Introduction \n\n17 \n\nsystematic way, of different communities, as well as for the evaluation of their evolution \n\n(Magurran, 2004). \n\nTo evaluate the reef fish community present in the three vessel reefs after a year \n\nof deployment, the fish assemblages structure was characterized using species \n\nabundance and frequency of occurrence, trophic guilds and biological indices (species \n\ndiversity and evenness), and were compared amongst them, using other reef areas in \n\nthe northeastern coast of Brazil as reference.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n18 \n\nDATA ANALYSIS \n\n Diversity Indices \n\nAccording to Magurran (2005), community\u2019s diversity should be divided in two \n\nmain components: species richness (number of species) and the distribution of these \n\nspecies (relative abundance of each species). Therefore, in this study the following \n\nindices were calculated: Shannon-Wiener\u2019s diversity (H\u2019) and Pielou\u2019s evenness (J\u2019). \n\n \n\n? Shannon-Wiener\u2019s diversity index (H\u2019) \n\nThis index (H\u2019) is frequently used and its value is affected by the community\u2019s \n\nspecific richness and the distribution of the individuals among species (Krebs, 1999). It is \n\ncalculated by the equation: \n\n?\n?\n\n??\nS\n\ni\n\npipiH\n1\n\nln\u00b4 , \n\nwith pi as the proportion of individuals of species i. \n\n \n\n? Pielou\u2019s evenness (J\u2019) \n\nEvenness reflects the abundance distribution among every species of the \n\ncommunity. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, resulting in lower values (approaching 0) if \n\na species abundance is much higher than that of the others (Krebs, 1999). Its \n\nequation is: \n\n)(ln\n\n'\n'\n\nS\n\nH\nJ ? , \n\nwhere H\u2019 is Shannon\u2019s diversity index and S the number of observed species. \n\n \n\nFor the estimation of the biological components, the number of fish in large \n\nschools of some frequently occurring species (e.g., Haemulon aurolineatum, H. \n\nsquamipinna, Pempheris schomburgkii) or of species that occurred only occasionally but \n\nhad a large schooling behavior (e. g. more than 200 individuals) were not recorded. This \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Data Analysis \n\n \n\n19 \n\ndecision was based on the problems associated with sampling large schools due to their \n\ngeometry, size and species composition (Bortone &amp; Bohnsack, 1991). \n\n Frequency and abundance \n\nTo describe and compare the community among sites, frequency of occurrence \n\n(f.o.) and relative abundance (r.a.) were also determined, using the following equations: \n\n100.. x\nT\n\nT\nof\n\nt\n\ni\n?  and 100.. x\n\nN\n\nN\nar\n\nt\n\ni\n? , respectively, \n\nwith Ti as the number of transects in which the species i was registered, Tt the \n\ntotal number of transects, Ni the number of individuals belonging to species i recorded \n\nfor each vessel reef, and Nt the total number of individuals in that vessel. Species and \n\nfamilies were analyzed based on pre-determined abundance classes (adapted from \n\nFeitoza, 2001) (Table 1-1). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1-1. Frequency of occurrence and abundance classes used for Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus. \n\nFrequency of occurrence (f.o.)  Relative abundance (r.a.) \n\nVery common f.o. > 80%  Very abundant r.a. > 10% \n\nCommon f.o. = 51-80%    \n\nOccasional f.o. = 21-50%  Abundant r.a. = 2-10% \n\nUncommon f.o. = 11-20%    \n\nRare f.o. &lt;10%  Low abundance r.a. &lt;2% \n\n \n\nTrophic Guilds \n\nSpecies were trophically classified, based on available literature (Randall, 1967; \n\nCervig\u00f3n et al., 1993; Feitoza, 2001; Dominici-Arosemena &amp; Wolff, 2005; Halpern &amp; \n\nFloeter, 2008) and following Ferreira et al., (2004), as: Carnivores (C), Mobile \n\nInvertebrate feeders (MI), Omnivores (O), Piscivores (P), Planktivores (PL), Roving \n\nHerbivores (RH), Sessile Invertebrate feeders (SI) and Territorial Herbivores (TH).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Data Analysis \n\n \n\n20 \n\nAnalysis \n\nFor the analysis of the diversity indices (H\u2019 and J\u2019) and comparison of the \n\nfrequency classes and abundance of trophic guilds between vessels, the non parametric \n\nKruskal-Wallis test was used, after a non normal distribution (Lilliefors test of normality; \n\np<0.05) was found for both Taurus and Saveiros. For the comparisons of the diversity \n\nindices in each vessel reef throughout the study periods, a chi-square test was used. All \n\ntests had a 95% of Confidence Interval and were computed using BioEstat 3.0 software.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Results \n\n21 \n\nRESULTS \n\nStructure of the fish community  \n\nIn this study, 87 species belonging to 41 families and 64 genera (Appendix 1) \n\nwere registered in 44 dives for the three vessel reefs. The most species-rich families in \n\nthe vessel reefs (Figure 1-1, Appendix 1) were: Labridae, with seven to eight species; \n\nEpinephelidae, varying from three to five species; Haemulidae with five species in the \n\nthree reefs; Lutjanidae with four to five species; and Pomacentridae, with five and three \n\nspecies. Carangidae and Scaridae were represented by a maximum of four species, while \n\nthree species each were recorded for Acanthuridae, Pomacanthidae and Gobiidae. The \n\nother families registered in the study were only represented by one or two species. \n\n \nFigure 1-1. Number of species by family in each of the vessel reefs (Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus). \n\n \n \n\n Most families were represented by a larger number of species in Mercurius, with \n\nthe exception of the pomacentrids and scarids, which showed higher numbers in Taurus \n\n(Fig. 1-1). Saveiros showed a family distribution close to Mercurius, except for \n\nEpinephelidae, Lutjanidae and Carangidae, that had a smaller number of species. In \n\nTaurus, the distribution of species was different, especially for the serranids, with only \n\nthree species, and for pomacentrids and scarids, with the occurrence of five and four \n\nspecies, respectively, having thus a higher number of species than the other two vessel \n\nreefs. Haemulidae, Acanthuridae and Pomacanthidae were similar regarding the \n\nnumber of species in each reef, with five species for the first and three for the latter \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Results \n\n22 \n\ntwo. Gobiids were represented by two species in Taurus and by three species in \n\nMercurius and Saveiros (Fig. 1-1).  \n\n Concerning the resemblance of species, 55 species (63.2%) were common to the \n\nthree vessel reefs (Taurus, Mercurius and Saveiros), six species (6.9%) were only found \n\nin the deeper reefs (Mercurius and Saveiros) and 20 species (22.9%) were recorded in \n\nonly one vessel. Three species (3.4%) were common to the Mercurius (deeper) and \n\nTaurus (shallower), and another three to Saveiros (deeper) and Taurus (shallower) (Fig. \n\n1-2; Appendix 1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1-2. Percentage of species found among the vessel reefs Mercurius (M), Saveiros (S) and Taurus (T). \n\n \n \n\nRegarding the diversity indices (Fig. 1-3), the mean value for H\u2019 was the same for \n\nMercurius and Saveiros (2.83), with the latter having a little higher evenness, 0.83, than \n\nMercurius (0.82). Taurus had a lower H\u2019 and J\u2019, with 2.61 and 0.76, respectively. Using \n\nKruskal-Wallis test, no significant difference was found for Shannon\u2019s diversity between \n\nvessels (H=4.24, p=0.12) but there was a significant difference for the evenness between \n\nthe two deeper vessels and Taurus with H=11.66 and p<0.05.  \n\nNo significant differences were found among the classes of frequency of \n\noccurrence among vessel reef (Table 1-2), with the exception of \u201cvery common species\u201d \n\nS \n5.7% \n\nMS \n6.9% \n\nM \n9.2% \n\nMT \n3.4% \n\nT \n8.0% \n\nST \n3.4% \n\nMST \n63.2% \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Results \n\n23 \n\nbetween Mercurius and Saveiros and Mercurius and Taurus and of \u201ccommon species\u201d \n\nbetween Mercurius and Taurus. \n\n \n\n Figure 1-3.

Saveiros and Taurus had a \n\nsimilar pattern in the frequency of species, with occasional species (28 and 29%) \n\nfollowed by the very common (26 and 25%), the common and the rare species with the \n\nsame percentage (17 and 19%) and the uncommon species as the least frequent class \n\n(12 and 7%, respectively) (Fig. 1-4). For Mercurius, the very common (31%) were \n\nfollowed by the occasional (25%) and the rare species (22%), with the common and the \n\nuncommon being the least frequent species (with 13 and 10%).  \n\n       \nFigure 1-4.

The 10 families represented by three or more \n\nspecies in Mercurius (Fig. 1-7) were: Labridae, with eight species; Epinephelidae, with \n\nfive, Haemulidae and Lutjanidae, with five, Carangidae, with four, and Acanthuridae, \n\nGobiidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae with three species. Most of \n\nthese families were abundant (>2%), with the exception of Gobiidae and \n\nPomacanthidae, with only 0.6 and 1.4% of relative abundance, respectively (Fig. 1-7). \n\nFour other families, Scaridae, Scianidae, Holocentridae and Pempheridae, represented \n\nby two or only one species, had an abundant presence in Mercurius with the other 24 \n\nspecies only accounting for 6.2% of all the vessels\u2019 abundance.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Mercurius \n\n27 \n\nDuring the dives, 5185 individuals were counted in Mercurius, with the exclusion \n\nof the large schools, more than 200 individuals, of Mulloidichthys martinicus, \n\nOpistothonema oglinum, Haemulon aurolineatum and H. squamipinna.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1-7.

(1996), Fari\u00f1a et al. \n\n(2005) and McKenna Jr. (1997) observed that the best represented families found in the \n\nGulf of California, Venezuela and M\u00e9xico, respectively, were: Serranidae (with the \n\nEpinephelidae included), Labridae, Pomacentridae, Lutjanidae, Haemulidae and \n\nScaridae, which is the pattern observed in this study for the most species-rich families. \n\nHaemulidae and Labridae are known to be abundant families, in terms of species, in the \n\nnortheastern coast of Brazil (Floeter et al., 2001). \n\nAs far as the Brazilian coast and oceanic islands are concerned, the most \n\nrepresentative families remain almost the same, with a large importance of: the \n\nCarangidae family in Parcel Manuel Luiz (Rocha &amp; Rosa, 2001), Porto de Galinhas (PE) \n\n(Engmann, 2006), Tamandar\u00e9 (PE) (Ferreira et al., 1995), Arraial do Cabo (RJ) (Ferreira et \n\nal, 2001), Atol das Rocas (RN) (Rosa &amp; Moura, 1997) and Trindade Island (ES) (Gasparini \n\n&amp; Floeter, 2001); Gobiidae, Serranidae with the Epinephelidae groupers, and \n\nMuraenidae in Risca do Zumbi (RN) (Feitoza, 2001) and Coast of the Para\u00edba state \n\n(Feitoza, 1999; Rocha et al., 1998) with this last family also showing more species in \n\nMaracaja\u00fa (RN) (Feitosa, 2005; Feitosa et al., 2002). In a study made by Floeter et al. \n\n(2001), on the geographical variation of reef fish communities along the Brazilian coast, \n\nMuraenidae, Holocentridae and Chaetodontidae were found to be among the 10 most \n\nrepresentative families. However, this was not the case in the present study, with these \n\nfamilies represented by two or only one species.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Discussion \n\n37 \n\nComparing the number of species and families found in the present study with other \n\nstudies carried out nearby, some similarities can be found. In two studies that took \n\nplace in Porto de Galinhas, a beach 70 km south of Recife, Engmann (2006) registered 89 \n\nspecies belonging to 41 families, while Silva (2006) only found 74 species in 36 families. \n\nThese differences can be a result of different methodologies used. Although both \n\nstudies applied the transect, the first author used SCUBA dives while the second, despite \n\nusing intensive search, relied on snorkeling to sample the area. Even though the number \n\nof species varied between these two studies, 89 and 74, the results obtained for the \n\nvessel reefs were close, varying from 68 to 72. In Tamandar\u00e9, also in the south of \n\nPernambuco, some 100 km from Recife, Ferreira et al. (1995) found 103 species in 43 \n\nfamilies. However, their study site was located between two river mouths, which clearly \n\ninfluenced the composition of the recorded species, with some species associated with \n\nshallow and even brackish waters (e.g., Gerreidae and Hippocampus redi).   \n\nDiversity, Frequency and Abundance \n\nThe diversity indices calculated for the present study were somewhat higher \n\nthan those obtained for other sites along the Brazilian coast. The mean values for \n\nShannon\u2019s diversity ranged between 2.61-2.83, with the lowest value for the shallow \n\nvessel and the highest values for the two deeper vessels which, when compared to the \n\nvalues found in Porto de Galinhas, 1.2-2 (Engmann, 2006), Maragogi, 0.8-0.93 and \n\nMaracaja\u00fa, 2.02-2.63 (Feitosa, 2005), and Arquip\u00e9lago dos Currais, 2.26-2.46 (Pinheiro, \n\n2005), indicates a much more diverse fish community in the recently deployed vessel \n\nreefs. Interestingly, the area and height of the reef has been found to influence species \n\nrichness (Molles, 1978) which could be noted in our study with the highest values of \n\nShannon\u2019s diversity found in the larger vessel reefs, Mercurius and Saveiros, than in \n\nTaurus that is smaller both in size and height. Also, the higher diversity observed for the \n\ndeeper reefs can reflect the importance of depth in the fish diversity and abundance as \n\nit has been previously reported (e.g., Roberts &amp; Ormond, 1987; Pinheiro, 2005) \n\nThe Shannon results from this study also showed that the diversity found in the \n\nvessel reefs was greater than in two marine protected areas: Parcel Manuel Luiz, 2.31, \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Discussion \n\n38 \n\n(Rocha &amp; Rosa, 2001) and Atol das Rocas, 2.08 (Rocha &amp; Moura, 1997). As mentioned by \n\nFeitoza (2001), this is probably due to two factors: firstly the number of species in an \n\noceanic island is smaller than in coastal reefs due to isolation and typically small shallow  \n\nwater area (Floeter et al., 2001) and secondly, the complications in the employed \n\nsampling technique can result in sub or overestimation. The Shannon index value found \n\nby Feitoza (2001) in Risca do Zumbi, 2.95, was higher than the ones found in this study, \n\nand this difference is probably related to the type of methodologies used by that \n\nauthor, who used stationary point counts with several replicates in different areas, \n\nresulting in a much longer sampling period and also clove oil to collect the most cryptic \n\nspecies. The dimension and variety of sampled environments (e.g., caves and marine \n\nplateaus), as seen in Feitoza\u2019s study, can also influence the results obtained for a \n\ndetermined study area.  \n\nThe almost linear decline of the log abundances observed for the three vessels \n\nreflects, according to Bohnsack &amp; Bannerot (1986), an undisturbed and highly diverse \n\ncommunity. However, in this study Shannon\u2019s diversity and Pielou\u2019s evenness values \n\nwere higher and more stable for Mercurius and Saveiros than for Taurus. This suggests \n\ntwo possibilities: a) that the reef fish in Taurus are under a more intense process of \n\ncommunity regulation, which is reflected in the variability of the number of species and \n\nindividuals in the vessel, or b) Taurus, as one of the most visited new \u201cshipwrecks\u201d in \n\nthe coast of Recife has been subjected to an intense diving tourism (PNAPE, unpubl. \n\ndata) and the divers impact in settling communities can be reflected in the indices and \n\nin the number of rare and uncommon species of the vessel reef. One example of the \n\nprobable dynamics of the process of regulation of the fish community can be \n\nascertained by the non-occurrence of Ophioblennius trinitatis in Taurus. This territorial \n\nherbivore is abundant both in shallow and intermediate reefs in the northeastern coast \n\nand in our study area was only present in one of the deep reefs, when logically it should \n\nbe registered in the shallower one. Many factors affect the founding of herbivore \n\nterritory, such as the abundance of competitors for space and for food resources \n\n(Ceccarelli, 2007). In Taurus, the presence of two species of damselfish, Stegastes pictus \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Discussion \n\n39 \n\nand S. fuscus, might be affecting the establishment of a new species, O. trinitatis, due to \n\ntheir territorial nature. Nonetheless, other studies have also found larger values for \n\ndiversity and evenness in greater reefs (e.g., Friedlander &amp; Parrish, 1998) and found it to \n\nbe related with different physical and biological characteristics of the sampled habitats. \n\nOne of the universal characteristics of ecological communities is that some \n\nspecies are extremely abundant, some are moderately common and the remaining, \n\nusually the majority, are rare (Magurran, 2005) represented by only a few individuals. In \n\nthis study the results suggest that the communities, despite having good values for \n\ndiversity and evenness, are eventually still adjusting to changes in their ecological \n\nstructure probably caused by predation, competition and recruitment in the new \n\ndeployed reefs. \n\nTrophic patterns \n\nThe number of species belonging to each trophic group was close in the three \n\nvessels. However, the abundance of the different trophic guilds showed a distinct \n\npattern for omnivores, planktivores, mobile invertebrate feeders and territorial \n\nherbivores. \n\nThe higher abundance of omnivores found in Mercurius is a direct result of using \n\ndata of medium schools of common species, in this case four events of more than 50 \n\nindividuals of Chaetodipterus faber that accounted for more than half of the total \n\nomnivores in this vessel reef. This might prove that the use of data from large schools of \n\nfrequently found species in the vessels (e.g., Haemulon aurolineatum and H. \n\nsquamipinna) not only can be very biased for the estimation of large number of \n\nindividuals but also masks the importance of much lower abundance species that have, \n\nnevertheless, an important ecological function in the community\u2019s structure. \n\nIn this study, the planktivores were one of the most abundant groups in the \n\nvessel reefs, which is in agreement with other studies about vertical relief on artificial \n\nreefs (e.g., Rilov &amp; Benayahu, 2000; Lindquist &amp; Pietrafesa, 1989; Stephan &amp; Lindquist, \n\n1989). Arena et al. (2007) found significant differences in the abundance of planktivores \n\nin vessel reefs and natural reefs. However, in a study at natural reefs in Zumbi, in the \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Discussion \n\n40 \n\nnortheastern coast of Brazil (Feitoza, 2001), planktivores were also the main trophic \n\ngroup.  \n\nThe deployment of a vessel in an area with significant currents can cause \n\nhorseshoe vortexes and thus ressuspension or scouring of the sediment on the reef \n\nbottom (Lindquist &amp; Pietrafesa, 1989), which in turn causes recycling and regeneration \n\nof nutrients near the reef. As observed in a previous study on phytoplankton in two \n\nolder vessel reefs in Recife, the abundance of these organisms was higher in the area \n\naround the vessel than in the middle and upper water column (Santos, 2006). This \n\nprobably reflects the preference of these species for gathering in places with higher \n\nfood resources and thus explains the main aggregation of diurnal planktivores (e.g., \n\nChromis multilineata, Thalassoma noronhanum, Decapterus macarellus) that remain at \n\na depth near the vessel and not near the surface. Several planktivorous species, like \n\nChromis, tend to aggregate in mid-water above and/or around the artificial reefs (Jessee \n\net al., 1985) which can also be a reflection of the quantity of organisms associated with \n\nthe open sand plains, which according to Hobson &amp; Chess (1986) can be rich and \n\nabundant and can be exposed by burrowing or feeding habits of species such as \n\nDasyatis americana and Pseudupeneus maculatus. \n\nIn this study, although a higher number of planktivorous species were found in \n\nthe shallower vessel, a higher abundance of fish were observed in the deeper reefs, \n\nMercurius and Saveiros, which matches the results obtained in a study on artificial reefs \n\nin the south coast of Brazil (Pinheiro, 2005), in the deep reefs in Marshall Islands \n\n(Thresher &amp; Colin, 1986) and in coastal reefs in Hawaii (Friedlander &amp; Parrish, 1998). In \n\nthe latter study, the authors found that planktivores had a positive relationship with \n\ndepth, being more abundant along the deep reef slope and that their distribution \n\npattern must be related to the abundance of their major prey in deeper waters (Hobson \n\n&amp; Chess, 1986). This concurs with findings by Santos (2006) in which the values for \n\nchlorophyll a found in the deeper vessel reef were superior to the ones found in a \n\nshallower vessel nearer the shore of Recife.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Discussion \n\n41 \n\nMobile invertebrate feeders are usually, by far, the most important fraction of \n\nbenthic invertebrate predators, being equally important at inshore, midshelf and outer \n\nshelf reefs (Jones et al., 1991). These animals usually feed on high caloric food \n\nresources, like crabs and mollusks, which are abundant on hard and soft substratum \n\n(Harmelin-Vivien, 2002; Jones et al., 1991). As found in a complementary study, a part of \n\nthe PNAPE project (Costa et al., in prep), the sediments on both sides of the Mercurius \n\nand Saveiros are mainly composed of very coarse to medium sand with some granules. \n\nThis supports the idea of re-suspension and displacement of the bottom material in our \n\nstudy area resulting in the exposure of small burrows in the substrate surrounding the \n\nvessels, which allied to naturally existing small rocks, attract fishes and invertebrates. \n\nSome fishes use them for shelter and, in some cases, feeding grounds. Examples are \n\ndiurnal planktivores, such as Ptereleotris randalli or Opistognathus aurifrons, and \n\ncarnivorous species like Scorpaena plumieri. The distribution and abundance of benthic \n\nmacroinvertebrates is mostly related with the type of substrate and the frequency and \n\nintensity of disturbances in the habitat, with stable environments (e.g., tropical waters) \n\npresenting the most diverse fauna (Sanders Jr., 1968). Regarding the type of substrate, \n\nin a study conducted in the southernmost state of Brazil, Cap\u00edtoli &amp; Bemvenuti (2004) \n\nfound the highest diversity of benthic invertebrates in areas of highest substrate \n\ndiversity, with the dominance of sand, gravel and some mud, at depths of 20-30m. Using \n\nthis information, it can be thought that the greatest occurrence of mobile invertebrate \n\nfeeders in the shallower vessel is probably a reflection of the complexity of the \n\nsubstrate around the vessel which lodges a great variety of invertebrate (occurring with \n\nall three vessels) and the intermediate level of disturbance of the substrate by currents \n\nwhich is more intense in shallow depths.  \n\nIn a study in the Caribbean, Dominici-Arosemena &amp; Wolff (2005) observed that \n\nmobile invertebrate feeders tended to increase their abundance and diversity from the \n\nsheltered to the exposed areas, which can be the case in this study for Taurus, as it is \n\nsmaller than the other two vessel reefs, thus originating less available shelter for the \n\nfishes. However, in the individual species analysis it could be observed that the highest \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Discussion \n\n42 \n\nvalues of mobile invertebrate feeders in Taurus, when comparing with the other two \n\nvessels, were due to the presence of larger numbers of Haemulon plumieri, H. parra and \n\nMulloidichthys martinicus. There may be two main reasons for this: in the two deeper \n\nvessels enormous schools of H. aurolineatum and/or H. squamipinna that almost cover \n\nthe entire vessels are constantly present while in Taurus the schools are somewhat \n\nsmaller, which can result in a \u201ccamouflage\u201d effect of these large schools in species that \n\nlook alike (e.g., Haemulon squamipinna with H. plumieri and H. aurolineatum with M. \n\nmartinicus and H. parra). On the other hand, H. parra and H. plumieri do not school in \n\nsuch large numbers as H. aurolineatum and H. squamipinna, probably due to their larger \n\nsizes, and therefore their numbers are probably not so biased in Taurus as they could be \n\nin Mercurius or Saveiros. \n\nSubmerged vegetation creates an availability of resources, such as shelter and \n\nfood, affecting the distribution patterns of herbivores, invertebrate feeders and \n\nomnivores who prey on the associated epifauna (Anderson, 1994; Garpe, 2007). \n\nRegarding the herbivores, two patterns arose from the comparison between vessel \n\nreefs: Taurus presented more roving herbivore species than the deeper vessels which in \n\nturn had a larger number of fishes even when comparing the mean number of \n\nherbivores per dive; and Taurus showed the same number of territorial herbivorous \n\nspecies than another deeper vessel, Mercurius, but a much larger number of individuals.  \n\nThe roving herbivores dwell on reefs and migrate during the day to seagrass beds \n\nfor feeding (Ogden &amp; Zieman, 1977). This may allow a larger distribution pattern and \n\nresult in a small dependence on the development of algae and other organisms in which \n\nthey feed on the reef, for they can forage for food in nearby vegetation. On the other \n\nhand, territorial herbivores remain in their protected area for shelter and feed (Jan et \n\nal., 2003; Letourneur et al., 1997) and although territory size can vary between species \n\nand locations (Ceccarelli, 2007) it is logical that the type and abundance of food \n\nresources will affect the number of these small fishes. The fact that a larger number of \n\nterritorial herbivores were present in Taurus than in the deeper vessels is probably \n\nrelated to the more abundant macroalgae coverage and diversity at depths around 20 m \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Discussion \n\n43 \n\nthan near the 30 m isobath, as shown in a study on the Gaib\u00fa, just south of Recife \n\n(Pereira et al., 2007), meaning that a greater amount of algae is available in Taurus than \n\nin Mercurius and Saveiros. As the numbers and abundances of roving herbivores were \n\nsomewhat similar in the three vessel reefs, it suggests that food is not as limiting for \n\nthese species as their need for shelter. Dominici-Arosemena &amp; Wolff (2005) found that \n\nherbivores, like scarids, increased their numbers in sheltered zones which helps to \n\nexplain that one important factor for the regulation of their abundance is their \n\ndependence for shelter. This can be observed in our study by the larger abundance of \n\nroving herbivores occurring in Mercurius and Saveiros which have a larger size (29,1 m x \n\n7,4 m) than Taurus (26 m x 7 m), with size also acting as visual/audio stimulant and \n\nspatial reference for fish (Anderson et al., 1989; Jessee et al., 1985). \n\nSeveral factors have been related to the distribution of fish species on coral reefs \n\nlike substrate complexity, food and shelter availability, presence of currents, etc. \n\n(Williams, 1991). Reef morphology however seems to be one of the main factors that \n\ndetermines the organization of the reef fish communities (Letourneur, 1996) because it \n\ndetermines the existence of adequate shelter for some important species. The \n\navailability of large inner open spaces in the reef, although ideal for some nocturnal \n\nplanktivores species that tend to aggregate (e.g., Pempheris schomburgkii and \n\nOdontoscion dentex), might constitute a limiting factor for other species that prefer \n\nmore \u201ccustomized\u201d elements in the reef (e.g., small openings or holes with sizes near \n\nthe fish\u2019s own size) and vessels, concrete pieces and the so-used Reef Balls\n\u00ae\n are known \n\nto have a poor surface/area ratio and complexity (Figley, 2003).  \n\nIn the present study, some families did not present the expected patterns in \n\nterms of species number (e.g., muraenidae and gobiidae) probably due to two main \n\nfactors. Muraenids are known to remain hidden in holes and crevices during the day, \n\nforaging at night (Randall, 1967) and therefore one of the main reasons for the low \n\ncounts of Muraenidae species registered in all three vessel reefs was probably due to \n\nthe lack of appropriate holes for the size of these fishes. This might suggest that shelter \n\nfrom predation can be more important than food, in determining the presence and \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Discussion \n\n44 \n\nabundance of some species (Hixon &amp; Beets, 1989). Supporting these results is the fact \n\nthat the taxonomic lists obtained in several studies in the northeastern coast of Brazil \n\n(Engmann, 2006; Rocha et al., 1998) report Muraenidae as a species-rich family. The low \n\nnumber of gobiidae species in the vessel reefs, and surrounding area was due to the \n\ntype of methodology used. In a previous study carried out in the coast of Para\u00edba, the \n\nstate just north of Pernambuco where this project took place, Feitoza et al. (2005) \n\nregistered 10 species of gobiids inhabiting intermediate coastal waters and this author \n\nalso found 6 species of this family in intermediate reefs of Zumbi, in the coast of Rio \n\nGrande do Norte, the state north of Para\u00edba (Feitoza, 2001). These results show that a \n\nlarger number of gobiids could probably be found in our vessel reefs but were not \n\nidentified as a result of the census techniques employed, as both the studies mentioned \n\nabove used fish anaesthetics to collect and identify specimens.  \n\nAlthough there were some differences observed, between the vessel reefs and \n\nother natural reefs in northeastern Brazil, the structure of the artificial reefs fish \n\ncommunities was mostly similar to the patterns observed in the natural ones. The main \n\ndifferences found (e.g., biological indices values) were probably influenced by the \n\nstructural characteristics of the compared areas and differences regarding the used \n\nmethodologies (e.g., the use of transect versus stationary point counts; the use of clove \n\noil). In spite of this, the vessel reefs showed a diverse community, and although \n\nregulation processes are still taking place, especially in the shallower artificial reef, the \n\nreefs prove themselves capable of offering shelter and food to most of the typically \n\nfound species in the area.  \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2. COLONIZATION AND ECOLOGIC SUCESSION IN TWO \nVESSEL REEFS ON THE COAST OF RECIFE (PE) - BRAZIL\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Introduction \n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nAny newly available patch of habitat is subject to colonization by organisms, \n\nwhich are prepared to colonize unoccupied environments (Valiela, 1995). The \n\ncolonization of a reef is the result of the dispersion and settlement of pelagic larvae \n\nand/or immigration of juveniles and adults (Matthews, 1985; Carr &amp; Hixon, 1997). \n\nAccording to Solonski (1985), individuals from suboptimal habitats may move to more \n\noptimal areas when new habitat or food becomes available, and this type of \n\ncolonization may occur from species living in nearby natural reefs or those without a \n\nterritory. These movements will depend on the diversity and health of the local \n\necosystem and on the populations it shelters, for that will determine the pool of \n\navailable species to colonize the new habitats (Caley &amp; Schluter, 1997; Belyea &amp; \n\nLancaster, 1999).  \n\nIt has been suggested that inter and intra specific interactions pose as the main \n\nlimits for the coexistence and diversity in natural communities (e.g., MacArthur &amp; \n\nLevins, 1967). However, it is now accepted that the structure and dynamics of these \n\ncommunities is the outcome of both interactions of biotic and environmental factors \n\n(Menge &amp; Sutherland 1976; Dunson &amp; Travis 1991). Thus, as a consequence of the \n\ncomplex interactions among species (e.g competition, predation, facilitation) and \n\ntemporal and spatial stochastic variations (e.g., recruitment), the structure of fish \n\ncommunities in different locations cannot be predicted (Doherty, 1991; Hixon, 1991; \n\nSale, 1991). According to Munday et al. (2001), different combinations of resource \n\noverlap, competitive abilities, and competitive outcomes are expected to be found in \n\ncommunities where species coexist.  \n\nIt is possible to compare artificial reefs relying on the list of species that inhabit \n\nthem, as the presence/absence of certain species might provide an indication of the \n\nnature of these habitats (Bortone &amp; Bohnsack, 1991). Several reasons, such as the reefs\u2019 \n\ngeometric configuration, the behavioral features and abundance of species present and \n\neven possible variations between the ability of different observers to see and identify \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Introduction \n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nsome species, may determine the chances to register the occurrence of a given species, \n\nso caution must be taken when using this approach (Harmelin-Vivien et al., 1985; \n\nBortone &amp; Bohnsack, 1991), both in sites subject to human interference or not. \n\n Tourism is one of the most remarkable socio-economic phenomena of the \n\ntwentieth century, with earnings from international tourism reaching US$ 476 billion \n\nwhich is larger than the export value of any other single category of product or service, \n\nincluding petroleum products (Neto, 2002). \u201cDiving has become a booming branch of \n\nthe tourism business\u201d, and differently from the general tourism, this activity targets \n\nsmall coastal areas in tropical countries, mostly with poorly developed economies (Van \n\nTreeck &amp; Schuhmacher, 1998). Several studies have been conducted in coral reefs to \n\ndetermine the impacts of the diving activity (e.g., Hawkins et al., 1999; Tratalos &amp; \n\nAustin, 2001; Uyarra &amp; C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2007) with many regarding only the effects on the coral \n\ncommunity. Although it has been found that coral reefs endure physical contact by \n\ndivers, this impact is reflected in the loss of large massive corals (Hawkins &amp; Roberts, \n\n1993). Regarding fish communities, however, no significant impact has been found, \n\nalthough studies using electronic devices have reported the avoidance reactions of \n\nseveral fish species to the presence of divers (e.g., Stanley &amp; Wilson, 1995; Schmidt &amp; \n\nGassner, 2006). Nevertheless, in the northeastern coast of Brazil, two studies on the \n\nimpact of marine tourism, both on trampling and diving, have concluded that the main \n\nfactor influencing the fish community was the offer of food by tourists, which could be \n\nattracting some \u201copportunistic\u201d species, thereby changing the overall trophic structure \n\nof the communities (Feitosa, 2005; Engmann, 2006). \n\nIn order to identify the influence of recreational diving on the colonization \n\nprocess of reef fish in artificial reefs, two identical vessel reefs, one open to recreational \n\ndives and the other only to scientific dives done within the framework of the present \n\nstudy, were compared after a year of deployment, through the characterization of the \n\nfish assemblages by the use of trophic guilds and spatial categories. A brief evaluation \n\nand comparison was made on the visual census methodology used, observing the \n\ninfluence of divers\u2019 presence in the studied spatial categories. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nMETHODS \n\nStudy site  \n\nThe data for this study were collected from two vessel reefs, Mercurius and \n\nSaveiros, located on the coast of Recife (PE) in northeastern Brazil (Fig. 2-1), as \n\nmentioned earlier (see Study area). The two vessels were chosen for their similarity in \n\nterms of size and deployment area, sampling similarity (e.g., the number of dives and \n\nthe beginning of the sampling period) and differential usage, with Saveiros open for \n\nrecreational diving and Mercurius only available for research dives.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-1. Map of study site, with the location of the two vessels, Mercurius and Saveiros. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Methods  \n \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\nTo confirm if the sampling period was adequate, a cumulative curve was plotted \n\nwith the number of species registered throughout the dives. According to Begon et al. \n\n(2006), sampling is considered adequate when the cumulative number of species \n\nstabilizes. \n\nFor the analyses of colonization, each fish species registered during the dives \n\nwas assigned to a category according to its spatial distribution (adapted from Nakamura, \n\n1985 and Okubo &amp; Kakimoto, 1991), with: A \u2013 species that prefer physical contact with \n\nthe reef; B \u2013 species that are associated to the reef by vision and sound; C \u2013 species that \n\nremain in the water column; and D \u2013 species that use the area/surroundings of the reef \n\n(Fig. 2-2). . This allows the study of specific groups that share functional relationships, \n\nallowing the comparison of similarities of unrelated species.  \n\nTo compare differences between the number of species belonging to each \n\nspatial category, throughout the study period, a chi-square test was used. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-2. Schematic representation of the relationship of species with the artificial reef (adapted from \nNakamura, 1985 and Okubo &amp; Kakimoto, 1991). \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Methods  \n \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nSpecies were also assigned a trophic category based on visual observations and \n\navailable literature (Randall, 1967; Feitoza, 2001; Dominici-Arosemena &amp; Wolff, 2005; \n\nHalpern &amp; Floeter, 2008). The eight trophic groups, following Ferreira et al. (2004), \n\nwere: C \u2013 Carnivorous; O \u2013 Omnivores; MI \u2013 Mobile Invertebrate feeders; P \u2013 Piscivores; \n\nPL \u2013 Planktivores; RH \u2013 Roving Herbivores; SI \u2013 Sessile Invertebrate feeders and TH \u2013 \n\nTerritorial Herbivores. Frequency classes were also used with: very common (VC) - \n\n>80%; common (C) \u2013 51-80%; occasional (O) \u2013 21-50%; uncommon (U) \u2013 11-20% and \n\nrare (R) with&lt;10% of occurrence. \n\nHierarchical cluster analysis, using the Bray-Curtis similarity index (Bloom, 1981) \n\nbased on a presence/absence matrix was used to evaluate the colonization process and \n\nresemblance between reef fish assemblages. Presence/abundance data was used as it \n\nconfers the same weight to abundant and rare species (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 2001). A non-\n\nmetric multidimensional scaling ordination (MDS) was also used to evaluate spatial and \n\ntemporal differences in the communities (Field et al., 1982) between both vessel reefs. \n\nOne-way ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarity) and SIMPER (Similarity Percentage \n\nAnalysis) routine were used to examine the potential differences in the studied \n\nassemblages among sites and dives and to identify the species responsible for the \n\ndissimilarity between the obtained groups. All the multivariate analyses were conducted \n\nusing the PRIMER 6? \u00ae software (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 2001). \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\nFrom July 2006 to July 2007, a total of 80 species were registered, with 72 for \n\nMercurius in sixteen dives and 69 for Saveiros during seventeen surveys (Appendix 4). \n\nThe cumulative curves for the number of species were similar for the two vessels (Fig. 2-\n\n3). In the first dive on July 2006, 27 species were found in Mercurius and 24 in Saveiros. \n\nFor Mercurius, the number of species increased sharply in the first two months of \n\nsampling, four months after the deployment of the vessel, with a subsequent moderate \n\nbut steady increase from September to March reaching 68 species. From March on, \n\nthere was only the addition of one or two species per dive. For Saveiros, a constant \n\nincrease was registered, from July to February, when the number of species reached 68. \n\nFrom March on there was only the addition of one new species until July 2007. From \n\nSeptember to March, Saveiros had a greater number of recorded species than \n\nMercurius, with a difference ranging from 1 to 6 species.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-3. Cumulative curve of number of species observed in Mercurius and Saveiros. \n\n \n\nDuring the study, a differential increase in the different trophic categories (Fig. 2-\n\n4) was observed. It was possible to distinguish a sharper increase in the number of \n\nomnivores, carnivores and mobile invertebrate feeders, with a rise varying from eight to \n\n10 species in each category.

The territorial herbivores were the last species to appear, with Stegastes pictus \n\nand Ophioblennius trinitatis in Mercurius and only S. pictus in Saveiros.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-4.

The \n\ndistribution observed for type C, or pelagic, species was not satisfactory due to the \n\nabsence of very common species, which represented 25-30% of the total number of \n\nspecies (Chapter 1) and the lack of a pattern for the frequency classes, showing an almost \n\nopposite pattern of species frequency classes in the two vessels.  \n\nFigure 2-6. Pie charts for the number of species belonging to each frequency class, for all spatial \ncategories in Saveiros. N is the total number of species belonging to each spatial category. \n\nAs expected, not all spatial categories are well represented in every trophic group, \n\ndue to the relation of some feeding habits to predetermined spatial movements.

From a total of 80 species, only \n\n13 (16.3%) showed a different pattern in the colonization of Mercurius and Saveiros, with \n\nthe greatest disparity concerning Epinephelus adscensionis and Gnatholepis thompsoni that \n\nwere registered in the 4\nth\n\n month and 6\nth\n\n in Saveiros and only in the 15\nth\n\n and 11\nth\n\n month in \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Results \n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nMercurius, and Mulloidichthys martinicus that was listed in Mercurius six months before it \n\nappeared in Saveiros.   \n\nThe 2-dimensional MDS, despite the great similarity (>50%) found among every \n\nsample, distinguishes Mercurius from Saveiros (Figure 2-7). The differences found in the 4\nth\n\n \n\ndive in Mercurius and the 5\nth\n\n and 7\nth\n\n dive of Saveiros were mostly due to the smaller \n\nnumber of species observed in those dives, ?22, than in any other which was always \n\nsuperior to 24 species. Although the R-statistic generated by the ANOSIM, R = 0.203, \n\nimplied little segregation between the two vessel-reefs, the p-value of &lt;0.05 showed that \n\nthere was a significant difference between Mercurius and Saveiros.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-7. The 2 dimensional MDS configuration for the dives (numbers) made in Mercurius (?) and \nSaveiros (?).  \n\n From the cluster analysis for both vessels (Figure 2-8 and 2-9) it was possible to \n\nobserve the different capacity of each spatial category to describe the dives throughout the \n\nstudy period. In the clusters using all species, it can be observed that almost every dive for \n\nMercurius and Saveiros showed a similarity of more than 60%, with the exception of dives \n\n#5 and 7 in Saveiros, for the above mentioned reason. It can also be noted that in both \n\nvessels, the first four dives are separated from the rest (Figure 2-8 \u2013 I, II and Figure 2-9 \u2013 III, \n\nIV).  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Results \n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nType A, reef attached species, presented a similarity of about 50% for most dives in \n\nboth vessels, with the exception of dive #5 in Saveiros. For type C, pelagic species, there was \n\na similarity of 20% in Mercurius in all dives and about 15% for Saveiros, without dives #5, 13 \n\nand 14 for the latter (these represented by IX in Figure 2-9). However, for Mercurius, types \n\nA and C showed a gradual separation between dives while for Saveiros there was a more \n\nclustered distribution of the dives, showing groups of samples. Type C species showed a \n\ndifferent pattern for each of the vessel reefs. For Mercurius, it was possible to see a good \n\nconnection between most dives, with 12 dives (75%) with a similarity of about 45%, with a  \n\nsimilarity among all dives of ?20%. In Saveiros, with a smaller number of C species, the \n\ndifference between clusters was larger with three dives (#12, 13 and 14) showing a \n\nresemblance of 0% and the similarity for 75% of all dives of only ?25%. For type A, reef \n\nattached, species there was a somewhat different pattern between vessels, with Mercurius \n\nshowing a gradual separation of the dives, with about 80% of the dives having a similarity of \n\n?60% and Saveiros presenting the groups in clusters, with a reasonable temporal continuity \n\nfor the dives, with nearly 80% of the samples showing a similarity of ?50%. \n\n \nFigure 2-8. Cluster analysis for Mercurius, for all species and type A, B, C and D species. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Results \n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nThe cluster analysis for type D showed an extremely high similarity between many \n\nof the samples, with Saveiros having more type D species than Mercurius, and both showing \n\ncomplete similarity for some of the dives (Figure 2-8 \u2013 VII and Figure 2-9 \u2013 X). \n\nType B species, for Saveiros, distinguished the first dives in one cluster and the last \n\ndives in another (Figure 2-8 \u2013VII, VIII), with the exception of dives #5 and 7 as mentioned \n\nabove, showing a strong similarity of more than 65% between all dives. For Mercurius, \n\ndespite the similarity of about 70% between every dive, it is possible to see three groups \n\n(Figure 2-8 \u2013 III, IV, V). By comparing the cluster analyses using every species and type B \n\nspecies, it is possible to see the resemblance of both plots on the distribution of the dives in \n\nthe study period, with an almost complete match for Saveiros (Figure 2-9 \u2013 I, II, III, IV with V, \n\nVI, VII, VII) and a small difference but with very good similarity between the groups of \n\nMercurius (Figure 2-8 \u2013 I, II and IV, V). \n\n \nFigure 2-9. Cluster analysis for Saveiros, with all species and type A, B, C and D species. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n59 \n\n \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nSpecies colonization \n\nThe fish colonization in both vessels was similar, with a rapid increase in the first \n\nmonths and a more moderate growth in the following months for Mercurius and a \n\nconstant increase throughout the study period for Saveiros. Less than one year after \n\ndeployment, the fish assemblages in both vessels appear to have reached stability \n\nwithin a timeframe already observed both in tropical and temperate environments \n\n(Randall, 1963; Ogden &amp; Ebersole, 1981; Golani &amp; Diamant, 1999; Jardeweski &amp; \n\nAlmeida, 2005; Leit\u00e3o et al., 2008; ).  \n\nThe two vessel reefs presented similar results regarding trophic and spatial \n\ndistribution, with the main difference being found regarding the species present in each \n\nreef. This agrees with Sherman et al. (2001) who found that different results may be \n\nobtained for artificial reefs within the same geographical area. \n\nIn a study conducted by Randall (1963) on an artificial reef in the U.S. Virgin \n\nIslands, the author registered all species arriving on the reef until the 10\nth\n\n month, but \n\nfrom then until the 14\nth\n\n month no increase in the number of species was observed, with \n\nonly a change in the number of individuals and a \u201creduction in the number of small \n\nfishes and an increase in the larger ones\u201d (Randall, 1963; Ogden &amp; Ebersole, 1981).  \n\nThe results from the present study were compared to those of Randall (1963) \n\ndue to their resemblance regarding climatic conditions, as both studies were located in \n\ntropical areas, and deployment time, with Randall Reef being deployed  in April and our \n\nvessels in May. Although it was not possible to sample the artificial reefs in the initial \n\nperiod of the study, due to bad sea conditions and water visibility, the reefs were \n\ncompared from the third month on. The species encountered in the first months in the \n\nvessel-reefs were mostly the same, with Holocentrus adscensionis, Pseudupeneus \n\nmaculatus, Ocyurus chrysurus, Chaetodon striatus, Alphestes afer, Halichoeres poeyi, all \n\nthe three species of Acanthuridae, and even Thalassoma noronhanum, the sister species \n\nof T. bifasciatum (Costagliola et al., 2004) being registered from the beginning of the \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n60 \n\n \n\ndives, just as described by Randall (1963). Despite the similarity in the pattern observed \n\nin Randall Reef and our reefs, some species showed a marked difference in the time of \n\narrival to the new habitat (e.g., most Halichoeres and Ophioblennius trinitatis).  \n\nThe Labridae are an interesting case, with the appearance of H. poeyi, the \n\ngeneralist wrasse found both in inshore reefs and seagrass beds (Randall, 1967), in the \n\nbeginning of both studies, which in our case is probably related to its high frequency of \n\noccurrence and abundance in the northeastern coast of Brazil (Feitoza, 2001; Feitosa, \n\n2005; Engmann, 2006), where it occurs from shallow to intermediate-deep reefs \n\n(Feitoza, 1999).  \n\nAnother species with the same early arrival, for the same reasons as H. poeyi, \n\nwas the reef-specialist H. brasiliensis, with its sister species H. radiatus (Rocha et al., \n\n2005) being the last Halichoeres to arrive in Randall Reef. An inverse pattern was \n\nobserved with H. bivittatus and H. maculipinna which were present in Randall Reef from \n\nthe 1\nst\n\n and 2\nnd\n\n month but that only arrived in both our vessel-reefs in the 8\nth\n\n and 6\nth\n\n \n\nmonths. It is believed that this difference in arrival time is related with the distribution \n\nof these species and especially in the location of the reef, because Randall Reef is \n\nsituated at depths of around 9 m and our reefs are at a distance of more than 5 nautical \n\nmiles from the coast and at a depth of nearly 30 m. Halichoeres bivittatus was reported \n\nas having a smaller abundance than other species of the genus Halichoeres in both \n\ncoastal reefs of Pernambuco (Engmann, 2006) and in 15 m deep shipwrecks in Para\u00edba \n\n(Feitoza, 1999). Even though it is a generalist species occurring in reef and non-reef \n\nhabitats (Rocha et al., 2005), this species is probably not able to compete with the \n\nalready established H. poeyi and H. brasiliensis, only succeeding after settlement of the \n\nother Halichoeres species. As shown by Nagelkerken et al. (2000b), the utilization of the \n\nbiotope is very specific to different species and even closely related species seem to \n\nhave a clear spatial separation resulting from avoidance of competition. \n\nThe early presence of H. maculipinna in Randall Reef can be due to the fast \n\ncolonization of their preferred benthic invertebrate prey, polychaetes (Randall, 1967) on \n\nthe artificial reef, which has been shown to begin as soon as two weeks after the \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n61 \n\n \n\ndeployment of concrete modules in a study in Hawaii (Bailey-Brock, 1989), with \n\nenvironmental variables (e.g., depth and grain size) affecting polychaete species \n\ncomposition (Fukunaga &amp; Bailey-Brock, 2008). In our study, its pair sister species H. \n\npenrosei (Rocha, 2004) was only observed from the 6\nth\n\n month on, which could be due to \n\nmisidentification in the first dives of juveniles of H. penrosei and of Thalassoma \n\nnoronhanum, which have a great resemblance in their color pattern.  \n\nThe late appearance in the deep vessel-reefs of Ophioblennius trinitatis, a hard \n\nbottom and crevice associated species (Ferreira et al., 1995), and Stegastes pictus, a \n\ndamselfish that usually inhabits cold and deep waters (Ferreira et al., 1998; Feitoza, \n\n1999), is probably due to their limited mobility and small home range often associated \n\nwith territorial herbivores (Labelle &amp; Nursall, 1985; Os\u00f3rio et al., 2006). However, their \n\narrival in the reefs was probably related to the patches of algae existing in the \n\nsubstratum, that can provide shelter for many marine invertebrates and small fishes \n\n(Parrish, 1989) and allow them to forage in unvegetated areas, acting thus as \u201csheltered \n\nbases\u201d (Orth et al., 1984). \n\nTrophic patterns \n\nFrom the continuous analyses of the number of species belonging to each of the \n\ntrophic groups, it can be observed that the numbers of mobile invertebrate feeders and \n\nroving herbivores decrease in total relative abundance as can be expected for these \n\nspecies that are usually associated with sand and algae beds and can swim large \n\ndistances, up to several kilometers, to forage (Hobson, 1973). Even so, the number of \n\nmobile invertebrate feeders increased more than the number of roving herbivores, \n\nwhich is probably related to the increase in the number of mobile invertebrate species \n\n(e.g., shrimps, sea urchins) due to the continuous formation of sand cavities on the base \n\nof the reef by currents and by the enhancement of the surface area for benthic \n\norganisms that provide shelter for both fishes and mobile invertebrates (Bohnsack et al., \n\n1994; Burgess et al., 2003; Figley, 2003).  \n\nThe eight species of roving herbivores recorded in this study represent most of \n\nthe known species for the northeastern coast of Brazil, with the pelagic species \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n62 \n\n \n\nKyphosus sectatrix, the whole Acanthuridae family and four of the seven species of \n\nScaridae (Moura et al., 2001) being present. The scaridae Cryptotomus roseus, Scarus \n\ntrispinosus and Sparisoma amplum had not arrived in the two vessel reefs after one year \n\nof study. The absence of C. roseus can be explained by its preference for waters deeper \n\nthan 30m (Feitoza, 1999), proved by their lack of occurrence in shallow coastal reefs \n\nsuch as Porto de Galinhas \u2013 PE (Engmann, 2006), Tamandar\u00e9 \u2013 PE (Ferreira &amp; Maida, \n\n2006) and Maragogi \u2013 AL (Feitosa, 2005). On the other hand, the lack of S. trispinosus \n\nand S. amplum is probably time related. This shows that this trophic guild was well \n\nrepresented in our study. An interesting observation is that juvenile scarids usually use \n\nthe algae beds, in the vicinity of the vessel reefs as both shelter and feeding grounds \n\nwith these sites acting as nurseries, as has been observed by Ogden &amp; Zieman (1977) in \n\nSt. Croix, Virgin Islands. \n\nThe strong initial presence in the vessel reefs and gradual decrease during the \n\ncourse of the study, of both mobile invertebrate feeders and roving herbivores, shows \n\nthat these species probably used the reef and were important in the colonization \n\nprocess, having a fundamental role in the energy transfer to the reef. Mobile \n\ninvertebrate feeders, such as haemulids, holocentrids and scianids, are known to be \n\nimportant commuters that shelter on/near the reef and forage in the surrounding areas, \n\nacting as transport agents of nutrients to the reef (Parrish, 1989; Meyer et al., 2000; \n\nBeets et al., 2003).  \n\nThe trophic groups that showed an increase in relative abundance were the \n\nomnivores and the planktivores. This increment in the number of species was probably \n\nrelated to greater food availability in the vessel reefs over time, with both plant and \n\nanimal material for the omnivorous species and with an increase in the biomass of \n\nphytoplankton available in the water column above the reefs, for the planktivores. Large \n\nplanktivorous feeding aggregations have been associated to the increase of nutrients in \n\nthe vicinity and in reefs, by providing the nutrients that potentially limit the growth of \n\nmacroalgae and also as part of the food web by feeding mobile invertebrates (Bray &amp; \n\nMiller, 1985). According to Kingsford &amp; MacDiarmid (1988), planktivore biomass can \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n63 \n\n \n\nalso sustain populations of piscivorous fishes. However, in our study the relative \n\nabundance in the number of piscivorous species decreased over time, but this is \n\nprobably more related to the fact that most of these species (>50%) are pelagic (e.g., \n\nCarangidae and Scombridae) and their sighting can be considered, most of the times, \n\noccasional, as reported by Bohnsack &amp; Bannerot (1986). Nevertheless, as pointed out by \n\nCampos &amp; Gamboa (1989) and Herrera et al. (2002), artificial modules can act as \n\naggregation points for pelagic species such as carangids. \n\nAll four species of sessile invertebrate feeders were already present by the 7\nth\n\n \n\nmonth, with Holancanthus tricolor being the last species to arrive, probably due to the \n\nfact that it is not very abundant in coastal reefs of the northeastern coast of Brazil, with \n\nno quantitative data of its presence in the coast of Pernambuco, such as at Porto de \n\nGalinhas and Tamandar\u00e9 (Engmann, 2006; Ferreira &amp; Maida, 2006;). However, in a study \n\nin the coast of Rio Grande no Norte, Feitoza (2001) observed that in every habitat he \n\nsampled H. tricolor was always the least abundant species of three species of \n\nPomacanthids.  \n\nSpatial categories and census detection \n\nThe use of visual census have been proved cost-effective for estimates of \n\nbiodiversity and abundance of reef fish communities (Bohnsack et al., 1999) and has \n\nbeen assumed as the best non-destructive method for population assessment (Brock, \n\n1982) being superior to several other techniques in habitats of great heterogeneity (De \n\nGirolamo &amp; Mazzoldi, 2001). Nevertheless, the data gathered by this method has to be \n\naccepted, most of the time, without an independent confirmation through another \n\ntechnique (Smith-Vaniz et al., 2006) and several sources of bias have been identified, \n\nsuch as observer presence and speed (Lincoln Smith, 1988) and fish behavior (Russell et \n\nal., 1978; Kulbicki, 1998; Willis et al., 2000). As previously mentioned, visual census \n\ntechniques also tend to underestimate the number and abundance of cryptic species \n\n(Kulbicki, 1990; Willis, 2001; Ackerman &amp; Bellwood, 2002; Smith-Vaniz et al., 2006) and \n\nalso of nocturnal species, such as Holocentridae and Apogonidae, that tend to remain \n\nhidden during the day (Kulbicki, 1990), which in our case was inside the cabin and deck, \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n64 \n\n \n\nmaking them difficult to detect and count. As a result, we have evaluated the biological \n\ncommunity by a mixture of visual census methodologies that we found to be suitable for \n\nthe studied reefs in order to reduce the inherent error associated with simple \n\ntechniques. The monthly sampling was proven satisfactory for our methodology, \n\nallowing us to observe the shaping of the community structure (Brotto et al., 2007) \n\nthroughout the study period.  \n\nIn this study, we chose to add another category to the Nakamura classification \n\nbecause even though there are some resemblances between type A and type D species, \n\nwe noted that most species were found consistently in one habitat (vessel reef or the \n\nsurrounding area) making it necessary to separate such species for a better analysis.  \n\n  Through the cluster analysis for each vessel it was possible to observe a pattern \n\nin the distribution of the dives. In an individualist analysis, we saw that clusters of type A \n\nand type C species indicate a similar pattern regardless of their similarity between dives, \n\nwhich is probably related to their behavior pattern at a diver\u2019s approach, with type A \n\nspecies hiding in crevices/holes and type C species fleeing the site. This creates a larger \n\nchance to observe these species, during a sampling dive in a known vessel reef area, \n\nthan type C species that can easily disappear in the water column, returning only after \n\nthe last diver has emerged.  \n\n The clusters for type C species obtained for both vessels were not very \n\nsatisfactory for the colonization process because although they created groups of dives, \n\nthose dives did not have a temporal continuity. However, an interesting pattern arose \n\nwith Saveiros, open for recreational diving, having not only a smaller number of pelagic \n\nspecies but a lower similarity between dives than Mercurius. This shows that although it \n\nis easier to identify and register pelagic species in non impacted sites such as Mercurius, \n\nin neither reef is the use of pelagic species as an indicator of the colonization desirable. \n\nIt has been previously reported that several highly mobile pelagic species (e.g., \n\nCarangidae) can be erroneously enumerated by underwater visual census (Buckley &amp; \n\nHueckel, 1985; Kulbicki, 1998) or avoid divers in locations with some degree of \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n65 \n\n \n\nanthropogenic impact, most usually regarding fishing (Russell, 1977 in Russell et al., \n\n1978; Guidetti et al., 2008).  \n\nType A species were consistently more numerous in Saveiros than in Mercurius \n\nthroughout the study period, and even species that were similar to both vessel reefs \n\nwere always registered first in Saveiros, with the exception of Ginglymostoma cirratum \n\nand some species that arrived at the same time in the reefs. The cluster analysis for this \n\ngroup shows a different pattern for each of the studied vessels, even though they \n\nstarted with the same number of species. Whilst in Saveiros there was the partitioning \n\nof the dives in two main clusters, in Mercurius although there were also two clusters, \n\nthere was a more gradual separation of the dives. The fact that there is no temporal \n\ncontinuity in either vessel is probably related to the large number of species observed \n\nonly after six months (approximately 50%) and also to the stabilization of the \n\ncommunity, composed by these species, both with the appearance of new species and \n\nthe restructuring of the old ones. \n\nIn type A species we included: (1) species that use complex spaces in the reef for \n\nshelter, such as Holocentrus adscensionis, Myripristis jacobus, Pempheris schomburgkii \n\nand Odontoscion dentex that can be found hiding or aggregating, for the two latter, in \n\nlarge enclosed spaces; (2) species like Pareques acuminatus and Apogon americanus \n\nthat hide very well in crevices of the reef (Randall, 1963); (3) species that show a strong \n\ndependence of the reef such as Amblycirrhitus pinos that rests upon hard substratum \n\n(Randall, 1967) or Stegastes pictus and Ophioblennius trinitatis that forage in small \n\nareas; and (4) ambush predators that can remain in the reef for long periods of time, \n\nsuch as Epinephelus spp. and Muraenidae, (Heemstra &amp; Randall, 1993; Juanes et al., \n\n2002). Although these species can often be observed in pre-determined sites in the reef, \n\nfor the first two types, others that are usually in a more exposed location can easily hide \n\nfrom view using either the reef structure or benthic cover, mostly for the two latter. This \n\npresents a whole array of detection possibilities, the outcome of which is not only \n\nrelated to the recognition ability of the diver and chosen census methodology, but also \n\nto the chance that the species is actually there. The fact that some of the species \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n66 \n\n \n\nincluded in this category, such as O. trinitatis have a very limited home range (estimated \n\nforage area is 4 m\n2\n (Mendes, 2006)) or S. pictus with an area of approximately 2 m\n\n2\n, and \n\ntaking into account that it probably has a similar foraging pattern as its substitute in \n\nshallow depths S. fuscus (Os\u00f3rio et al., 2006), probably indicates a slower process of \n\ncolonization of the intermediate vessel reefs by these and similar species.  \n\n Regarding type D species, it was possible to see strong similarities for both \n\nvessels, with larger number of species and similarities for the dives in Saveiros than in \n\nMercurius, and a similar pattern for the two. This type of species is characterized by \n\nsubstrate related behaviors, associated with protection, such as burying in the sand, \n\ndigging holes or even hiding themselves in burrows made by other organisms and \n\nfeeding. All species in this group obtain their food by close association with the \n\nsubstrate, either by directly foraging for invertebrates or animal/plant material, like \n\nPseudupeneus maculatus or Dasyatis americana and gobiids; by preying upon fishes \n\nventuring too near, like Synodus intermedius or Scorpaena plumieri; or even by hovering \n\nabove their burrows feeding on zooplankton, such as Opistognathus aurifrons and \n\nPtereleotris randalli (Randall, 1967; Gasparini et al., 2001). Type D species show the \n\ngreatest cryptic patterns, due to their coloration pattern and escaping means, being the \n\nleast abundant group, with the exception of pelagic species for Saveiros. Also, the \n\nstronger resemblance between the first dives is explained by the lower number of \n\nspecies which suggests the possibility of either a fairly long period for their arrival in the \n\nvessel reefs or underestimation of the real number of species due to their cryptic habits.   \n\nMany type A and D species are well camouflaged and tend to hide at the \n\napproach of an observer. According to Kulbicki (1998), in disturbed areas the detection \n\nof cryptic species (e.g., Serranidae and Synodontidae) tends to increase because fishes \n\ntend to move and become conspicuous, instead of remaining still and concealed by their \n\ncolor and behavior. This finding can be applied to this study with some species, such as \n\nSynodus intermedius, Epinephelus adscensionis, Amblycirrhitus pinos and Stegastes \n\npictus, which were recorded in Saveiros before being observed in Mercurius, an \n\nundisturbed area with restricted number of divers. This can also, to some extent, justify \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n67 \n\n \n\nthe presence of Scorpaena plumieri and Antennarius multiocellatus, two mimic species \n\nknown for their sedentary nature (Randall, 1967).  \n\n The major group of species, type B, was the best represented of the fish \n\ncommunity throughout the study, having not only the greatest similarity but also a good \n\ntemporal aggregation for most dives, in both vessels. These species are linked to the \n\nreefs but normally do not hide or flee in the presence of divers for which they have been \n\nconsidered as \u201cneutral fishes\u2019\u2019 by Kulbicki (1998) who studied the behavior of some \n\nspecies in the presence of divers and the implications in terms of bias. He considered \n\nthese fishes to be conspicuous by their shape or color (e.g., acanthurids, chaetodontids \n\nand scarids) and not affected by the presence of a diver, neither positively in the case of \n\n\u201ccurious fishes\u201d nor negatively by \u201cshy fishes\u201d. By having representatives of most \n\ntrophic guilds, with the exception of piscivores and territorial herbivores, and with a full \n\nrange of frequencies of occurrence, this group has proven to be quite capable of \n\nshowing possible changes in the community structure, especially in artificial sites where \n\nsampling can be complicated, as in the case of vessel reefs that have a complex \n\nstructure and are located at intermediate depths that do not allow long periods of \n\nimmersion using SCUBA for accurately sampling the whole reef and the surroundings. \n\n Regarding the differences between the vessel reefs, this study indicates that the \n\nimpact caused by divers is not perceptible, at least, during the first year of immersion of \n\nthe reefs, for the two communities have a large resemblance in terms of trophic \n\ncategories and overall community structure. It is important to highlight, though, that an \n\nadvanced level of diving skills (e.g., Advanced Open Water Diver in PADI certification) is \n\nneeded to dive in these reefs due to the depth of the sites. This probably influences the \n\npossible impact that the divers can have, both in benthic and fish communities. \n\nAlthough there is no consensus about the difference of impact between inexperienced \n\nand experienced divers, a greater negative influence of the first in the surrounding area \n\nhas been reported (Schaeffer &amp; Foster, 1998). According to Rouphael &amp; Inglis (1997), the \n\nchances of a diver to come into contact with reefs is determined by personal attributes, \n\nsuch as its technical competence as a diver, the activities he pursues whilst at the diving \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Discussion \n\n68 \n\n \n\nsite (e.g., photography, exploration) and his awareness of the environmental \n\nconsequences of his actions.  \n\nThe main goal of this chapter was to assess the main species in terms of trophic \n\ngroup and spatial category, in order to better understand the colonization process in the \n\ncoast of Pernambuco, tropical southwestern Atlantic. As expected, with the lack of \n\nstructural reefs for the enrichment of the continental platform, the deployment of \n\nvessel reefs can work as oasis in attracting/producing reef fishes, increasing the number \n\nof species present by at least 20 species in less than three months. By the \n\npresence/absence analysis we could comprehend the temporal changes inherent to the \n\nreef community development, allowing a greater focus on the species ecology rather \n\nthan group or quantity dynamics. \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3. COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN DIFFERENT REEFS IN THE \nNORTHEASTERN COAST OF BRAZIL \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n70 \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe Brazilian coral reefs have a unique character, which is the relatively low \n\ndiversity of their coral fauna, although they are rich in endemic species, including the \n\nsouthernmost reef communities of the Atlantic Ocean. The northeastern coast (between \n\n5 and 12\u00ba S) presents several types of reef structures with coastal isolated bank reefs of \n\ndifferent shapes and dimensions, forming up to three lines of reefs along the coasts of \n\nRio Grande do Norte, Para\u00edba, Pernambuco and Alagoas (Le\u00e3o &amp; Dominguez, 2000).  \n\nThe tropical fish fauna of the western Atlantic is distributed from 35\u00b0 N to 28\u00b0 S, \n\nwith a considerable part included in Brazilian waters, mostly from below the Amazon \n\nRiver mouth at Manuel Luiz Reefs (0\u00b052\u2019S) to Santa Catarina State (27\u00ba30\u2019 S) (Ferreira et \n\nal., 2004; Floeter et al., 2001). Several studies have described the differences in reef fish \n\ncommunities along latitudinal gradients in Brazil (e.g., Floeter et al., 2001; Ferreira et al., \n\n2004; Floeter et al., 2004), using diverse characteristics such as trophic or feeding \n\nstrategies, spatial use and mobility, resulting in the recognition of the northeastern \n\ncoast as a region with a distinct species composition. \n\nFew, if any, fish families are obligate coral reef dwellers (Bellwood, 1998), with \n\nmany species having a larger distribution associated with hard substrata and even sand \n\nplains, mangroves and seagrass beds (Lowe-McConnel, 1999). However, the concept of \n\nthe existence of some key reef families is widely accepted. The major taxa that \n\nconstitute this group are the chaetodontid fishes (Chaetodontidae and Pomacanthidae), \n\nthe acanthuroids (Acanthuridae and the Indo-Pacific families Siganidae and Zanclidae) \n\nand the labroids (Scaridae, Pomacentridae and Labridae) (Choat &amp; Bellwood, 1991).  \n\nAlthough the evaluation of the performance of an artificial reef should vary \n\naccording to the purpose for which it was built, a comparison of these structures with \n\nnatural reef systems, preferentially undisturbed, in local and regional scales is always \n\nuseful (Carr &amp; Hixon, 1997). According to these authors, this type of comparison can not \n\nonly increase the knowledge on the fish communities present in the area but also \n\ndetermine the spatial scales over which artificial structures act to attract reef species.\n\n\n\nChapter 3- Introduction \n\n71 \n\n \n\n  To understand the dynamics and resemblance between natural and artificial \n\nreefs in northeastern Brazil, a comparison was made among different reefs (shallow, \n\nintermediate and deep; artificial and natural), using reef fish species inventoried in \n\nseveral different studies.    \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n72 \n\n \n\nDATA ANALYSIS \n\nData collection \n\nFor this study the list of species observed, by visual census, in reefs from several \n\nlocations in the northeastern coast of Brazil was assembled from the available literature \n\n(Table 3-1) and compared to the results obtained by the present study from three \n\nartificial reef vessels (Taurus, Mercurius and Saveiros). Species sampled in other studies \n\nby other means than visual census (e.g., clove oil) were not included.  \n\nTable 3-1.

Regarding the intermediate depth reefs, from around 20 to 30 meters \n\ndeep, two geographical zones were used: Recife\u2019s coast with artificial vessel like reefs \n\n(Fig. 3-2) and Zumbi\u2019s natural reefs from available literature (Fig. 3-1).

The Bray-Curtis similarity and \n\ngroup average routine were used for the cluster analysis and a two-way ANOSIM \n\n(Analysis of Similarity) was conducted to assess possible differences due to the type and \n\ndepth of the studied reefs. To evaluate if there was a difference in the species \n\ncomposition between the sites in terms of the typical reef families, a separate analysis \n\nwas run, using only species belonging to the Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, \n\nPomacanthidae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae families. Two-way ANOSIM and a SIMPER \n\n(Similarity Percentage Analysis) routines were used to identify differences regarding \n\ntype and depth of reefs and species that most contributed for the differences, \n\nrespectively. All these multivariate analyses were conducted using the PRIMER 6? \u00ae \n\nsoftware (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 2001). \n\nTo spatially evaluate the differences between reefs, and corresponding groups of \n\nspecies that might influence their distribution, a correspondence analysis (CA) was used \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Data Analysis \n\n76 \n\n \n\non the available data with the Multivariate Statistical Package, MVSP 3.13\u00ae. No data \n\ntransformation or species weighting were used due to the data being only presence/ \n\nabsence.  \n\nAs the values obtained for the species that mostly contributed for the separation \n\nof the reefs was rather uneven, with points obtained from the correspondence analysis \n\nrepresenting from one to more than ten species, a spatial density graph was plotted in \n\nSurfer 8\u00ae software. For this plot, the spatial coordinates and associated number of \n\nspecies resulting from the CA were used, and squares of 0.1x0.1 were stipulated where \n\nthe number of species was added as to represent the total of species per square. The \n\nKriging gridding method was used to create the grid from which the plot was build, \n\nusing as minimum and maximum values for X and Y the limits of the CA graphic already \n\nobtained in MVSP 3.13\u00ae (Appendix 5).  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n77 \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\nFrom the cluster analysis, using all 196 species, it was possible to separate the \n\ndifferent reefs types, with all the reefs, except the deeper ones (Fig. 3-3, I), showing a \n\nsimilarity of more than 50%. The shallower reefs had a resemblance of more than 60% \n\n(Fig. 3-3, II). The intermediary reefs, both artificial and natural, were all in the same \n\ncluster with similarities ranging from 60 to 85% (Fig. 3-3, III).  \n\nFigure 3-3 \u2013 Cluster analysis for the 14 compared reef environments, with both artificial (?) and natural \n(?) reefs, using all families: I \u2013 deep reef; II \u2013 shallow/coastal reefs; III \u2013 intermediary reefs. \n\n \n\nIn the cluster analysis, using only the typical reef families, four groups were \n\nformed with the deep reefs and Marte (Fig. 3-4, I and II) having a similarity of 58 and \n\n63%, respectively, and the natural and/or shallow reefs as a third group (Fig. 3-4, III) \n\nwith similarities ranging from 75 to 92%. The other seven artificial reefs formed the \n\nfourth group (Fig. 3-4, IV), showing a strong similarity of more than 85% between \n\nelements of the set. \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Results \n\n78 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3-4 \u2013 Cluster analysis for the 14 compared reef environments, with both artificial (?) and natural (?) \nreefs, using only the typical reef families (Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, Pomacanthidae, \nPomacentridae and Scaridae): I \u2013 deep reef; II and III \u2013 intermediary artificial reefs; IV \u2013 coastal and \n\nintermediary natural reefs. \n\n \n\nThe two-way ANOSIM results, for all families and using only typical reef families, \n\nshowed that although both reef type and depth accounted for some of the variations, \n\nthere were no significant differences for either parameter (Table 3-3), with depth \n\nshowing, nevertheless, a greater influence than the type of reef.  \n\n \n\nTable 3-3 \u2013 Two-way ANOSIM results for the type and depth of the studied reefs, using all families and \nonly typical reef families. \n\n Parameter Global R p value \n\nA\nll\n\n \nfa\n\nm\nil\n\nie\ns Between type 0.54 0.22 \n\nBetween depth 0.93 0.07 \n\nR\ne\n\ne\nf \n\nfa\nm\n\nil\nie\n\ns Between type 0.46 0.22 \n\nBetween depth 0.74 0.13 \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Results \n\n79 \n\n \n\nDue to the larger number of artificial intermediate depth reefs than natural \n\nintermediate depth reefs, eight versus one, some important reef associated species, \n\nonly present in the natural reef, obtained a low result in the SIMPER analysis (Appendix \n\n6). The four species that contributed most were Centropyge aurantonotus, Chaetodon \n\nocellatus, Microspathodon chrysurus and Stegastes variabilis, all present only in the \n\nnatural intermediate reef. The three species that were not present in the natural reefs \n\nbut were present in the artificial ones were Chromis jubauna, Halichoeres bivittatus and \n\nScarus trispinosus. Stegastes fuscus and Sparisoma amplum, despite being present in \n\nboth natural and artificial reefs, showed a preference for the former, as they were \n\npresent in only three and one vessel reef, respectively.  \n\nThe results of the correspondence analysis (Fig. 3-5) showed a spatial pattern of \n\nthe reefs with the configuration of three groupings that corresponded to: the shallow \n\nand/or coast sites, intermediary reefs, and the deeper reefs. The shallow reef group \n\npresented a wider distribution than the intermediary reefs, with these last ones being \n\nplotted more tightly in the negative part of axis 2. The deep natural reef showed the \n\nlargest difference in species composition, both from the shallow and intermediary reefs. \n\nWhen plotting the reef sites and species together in the correspondence analysis \n\n(Fig- 3-6), it was possible to see a distribution pattern for several species which \n\nsupported the division of groups containing characteristic species (Table 3-4). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Results \n\n80 \n\n \n\n Figure 3-5. Correspondence Analysis for the 14 compared reef environments. \n\n \n\nBy the spatial points obtained in the correspondence analysis, it was possible to \n\nobserve that the greatest density of species was positioned in the shallow reef area (Fig. \n\n3-7, a) and also in zones that aggregated species belonging to shallow and intermediary \n\nreefs and species belonging to all sites (shallow, intermediate and deep reefs) (Fig. 3-7, \n\nb and c).  \n\nSpecies that were found only in shallow and intermediary reefs include \n\nAnisotremus virginicus and Haemulon squamipinna (Haemulidae), Halichoeres \n\nbrasiliensis and H. penrosei (Labridae), Sparisoma frondosum and Scarus zelindae \n\n(Scaridae), Diodon holacanthus and D. hystrix (Diodontidae) and the serranids \n\nEpinephelus adscensionis and Rypticus saponaceus. In this group are also included \n\ncryptic species such as Pempheris schomburgkii and Odontoscion dentex, the \n\nomnivorous Abudefduf saxatilis and Canthigaster figueiredoi, the carnivorous \n\nGymnothorax funebris and the piscivorous Synodus intermedius. Acanthurus bahianus \n\nunlike the other two species belonging to the genus, was only found in the shallower \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Results \n\n81 \n\n \n\nreefs. In this group, 23 of the 41 species were found, at least, in three of the shallow \n\nreefs and five of the intermediate ones (Fig. 3-7, b). \n\nThirty species were present in all reefs, from shallow to deep, with Lutjanidae as \n\nthe most species-rich family, with five species, followed by Haemulidae and Labridae, \n\nwith three species each. Several families had most, or all, of its species in this group, \n\nsuch as Acanthuridae, Gobiidae and Pomacanthidae with two of its three species \n\npresent, and Holocentridae and Mullidae with both their species represented in all reef \n\nenvironments.  From these 30 species, 22 had a similar distribution patterns, resulting in \n\nthe large spatial density of points in the center of the correspondence analysis (Fig. 3-6 \n\nand Fig. 3-7, c). \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Results \n\n82 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3-6 \u2013 Correspondence Analysis for all fish species for the 14 compared reef environments, described in Fig. 3-3.   \n\nKey to species numbers as in Table 3-4.

The results suggest that the separation of \n\nthese groups is more related with depth than the type of reef involved. As has been \n\npreviously reported, parameters such as depth, currents and even nearby sea grass or \n\nalgae beds can play an important role in determining the fish community structure \n\nthrough their trophic significance (Gladfelter et al., 1980).  \n\n However, in the cluster analysis using only families with complete association \n\nwith coral reef environments \u2013 Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, \n\nPomacanthidae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae - it was possible to observe the integration \n\nof the intermediate natural reef (Zumbi) in the natural reefs group. This may reflect the \n\nneed of some species for intrinsic characteristics of natural reefs (e.g., specific food \n\nresources). Nevertheless, one of the main constraints of this study was the impossibility \n\nof comparing natural and artificial reefs in shallow and deep (i.e. > 40m) areas, for the \n\nonly artificial reefs intentionally deployed in the coast of Pernambuco are old vessels, \n\nwith these being sited at intermediate depths. This technical difficulty does not allow a \n\ncomplete differentiation between the influences of depth and reef type. \n\nThe associated reef species that most contributed to the differences among \n\nintermediate depth reefs and that were only found in the natural reefs were two \n\nchaetodontoid species (Chaetodon ocellatus and Centropyge aurantonotus) and two \n\nlabroid ones (Microspathodon chrysurus and Stegastes variabilis). The absence of these \n\nspecies in the vessel reefs is probably related to the non availability of proper habitat, \n\nfor C. aurantonotus and S. variabilis are species known to be associated with great \n\ntopographical complexity (Feitoza, 2001) and M. chrysurus as coral dependent \n\n(Carpenter, 2002a). Chaetodon ocellatus represents an interesting case as, in other \n\nstudies on vessel reefs (Arena et al., 2007; REEF, 2007), the species is present in recent \n\ndeployed reefs. However, in those two studies, a great proximity between natural and \n\nvessel reefs sites was observed which can explain the species presence in those new \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Discussion \n\n86 \n\n \n\nvessel reefs and their absence in old vessel reefs off Recife, with more than 100 years, \n\nsuch as Pirapama and Vapor de Baixo. The detection of these four species might also \n\nbeen affected by the low dive/ sampling effort in the intermediate depth artificial reefs \n\nin the coast of Recife (880 minutes in 44 dives) versus the time spent at Zumbi \n\nintermediate depth natural reef (a total of 1832 minutes) or the number of surveys on \n\nthe vessel reefs such as the study by REEF (2007) with 76 dives in a single artificial reef. \n\nAnother important factor to consider is the fact that even in the former natural reefs \n\n(Feitoza, 2001), the number of individuals of the four above mentioned species was very \n\nlow, varying from one specimen of C. aurantonotus and S. variabilis to 13 specimens of \n\nM. chrysurus, in a total of 50 visual census.  \n\nThree species, belonging to the considered typical reef families, Halichoeres \n\nbivittatus, Scarus trispinosus and Chromis jubauna, were found in the vessel reefs but \n\nnot in the intermediate natural reef. The occurrence of C. jubauna in the northeastern \n\ncoast of Brazil has been previously reported by Feitoza (1999, 2001) for depths from \n\n20 meters on, and one specimen was seen in Taurus in a total of 44 dives of this project. \n\nThis single occurrence reflects the low abundance of this species in the intermediate \n\nwarmer waters of the northeastern coast as opposed to greater abundances in deeper \n\ncooler water (>60 m) in the same geographic area (Feitoza et al., 2005) or in shallower \n\ncooler waters of the southeastern coast of Brazil (Moura, 1995; Luiz Jr. et al., 2008). \n\nHalichoeres bivittatus, present in six of the eight artificial reefs, shows a clear preference \n\nfor vessel reefs, especially as it is a species known to be present in coastal, intermediary \n\nand deep reefs in the northeastern coast (Feitoza, 1999, 2001; Engmann, 2006;). \n\nHowever, it is important to remark that only one natural reef was used in this \n\ncomparison and further analysis prove necessary for the correct understanding of this \n\nspecies preferences.  \n\nThis difference between intermediate reefs is probably related to the inherent \n\ndifferences between natural and artificial reefs, such as design and age of the reef, with \n\nmore resident or reef species being found in natural reefs than in artificial reefs (e.g., \n\nThanner et al., 2006), as shown in this study. As pointed out by Moffit et al. (1989), \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Discussion \n\n87 \n\n \n\nstructural material and design are important factors in the attraction of resident reef \n\nspecies, and it has been suggested that natural reefs have certain advantages that might \n\nnot be present in artificial reef sites (Burchmore et al., 1985). However, one important \n\nfactor to bear in mind is that the compared intermediate reef sites were located in two \n\ndistant areas, separated by nearly 200 nautical miles, and although the northeastern \n\ncoast is influenced by the North Brazil Current (Knoppers et al., 1999), different local \n\nwind and current regimes may result in different water circulation patterns. This \n\ndifference in oceanographic conditions can have a larger influence in the distribution of \n\nsmall and reef resident species (e.g., the six reef families studied), than on a wider \n\nspectrum of transient and pelagic species, partially explaining the observed discrepancy \n\nin the resulting clusters using some or all species. However, as mentioned before, the \n\nresults using all species indicate the distinction of three reef groups.  \n\nThe first group, corresponding to the shallow and/ or coastal reefs, was \n\ncharacterized by the presence of species that are associated with brackish estuaries, like \n\nthe mugilids (Cervignon, 1993), species that prefer shallow coastal marine waters such \n\nas Anisotremus moricandi, Archosargus rhomboidalis, Eucinostomus spp. and Myrichthys \n\nocellatus (Acero &amp; G\u00e1rzon, 1982; Carpenter, 2002a; Humann &amp; DeLoach, 2002), and \n\nresident species of the intertidal environment such as Labrisomus nuchipinnis (Rosa et \n\nal., 1997; Barreiros et al., 2004). The greatest number and density of representative \n\nspecies of these reefs is probably related to the importance of shallow reefs as nurseries \n\n(Jenkins &amp; Wheatley, 1998; Nagelkerken et al., 2000b; Lecchini, 2003) and protective \n\nsites with lower abundance of predators (Shulman, 1985; Parrish, 1989; Layman, 2000). \n\nThe second group, containing both natural and artificial reefs, clustered species \n\nwith distinct habits, residence and trophic levels. The four species that were unique to \n\nintermediary reefs (and present in more than 50% of them) varied from a pelagic, \n\ntransient and mobile invertebrate feeder, Aetobatus narinari, to a benthic and resident \n\ncarnivore, Amblycirrhitus pinos, and two benthic transient omnivores, Acanthostracion \n\npolygonius and Cantherhines pullus. The distribution of A. narinari is related to its \n\nbehavior. Since it is an active swimmer that can travel long distances (Carpenter, 2002b) \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Discussion \n\n88 \n\n \n\nit is understandable that its occurrence in the reefs is considered rare to uncommon. As \n\na pelagic species, it is expected to prefer areas of clear water, not being registered in \n\nany coastal and/ or shallow reefs. The presence of A. pinos, with a known distribution \n\nfrom 5 to 25 m (Debelius, 1997), as restricted to intermediate reefs probably reflects the \n\npreference of this species for these environments due to the absence of possible \n\ncompetitors that are present in the shallower reefs. The large abundance of the \n\ncarnivorous Labrisomus nuchipinnis in shallow reefs of the northeastern coast of Brazil \n\n(Rosa et al., 1997; Engmann, 2006; Pacheco, 2008) might be limiting the settlement of A. \n\npinos in those reefs. As observed by Pacheco (2008) in a study on territorial species in \n\nthe reefs of Tamandar\u00e9, south coast of Pernambuco, some territorial species appear to \n\nonly allow the presence, or at least did not display an aggressive behavior towards \n\nindividuals, of another species when there is no overlap of diets. This can help to explain \n\nthe absence of A. pinos in shallow reefs and the low abundance, or even total absence, \n\nof L. nuchipinnis in intermediate reefs (e.g., Rosa et al.,1997; Feitoza, 2001), as these \n\ntwo species might compete for the same resources. Furthermore, predation by L. \n\nnuchipinnis on several other species as well as agonistic interactions has been observed \n\n(Mendes, 2006).  \n\nThe deeper reef, although having pelagic species typically associated with the \n\nclear open water environment, such as Acanthocybium solandri, Coryphaena hippurus \n\nand Thunnus atlanticus in Feitoza (1999) (Carpenter, 2002a; Lessa et al., in press), was \n\nalso characterized by several species that were present both in the intermediate and \n\ndeep reefs. Among these were pelagic species that can be found over reefs, like \n\nRachycentron canadum and Elagatis bipinnulata (Debelius, 1997; Carpenter, 2002a), as \n\nwell as species of deep water environments, such as Clepticus brasiliensis and Stegastes \n\npictus (Ferreira et al., 1998; Heiser et al., 2000; Halpern &amp; Floeter, 2008). This group was \n\nalways distinct from the other clusters, either using all species or just typical reef \n\nfamilies, probably as a result of its distinct species composition and also its distance \n\nfrom the coast. This deep water environment presents carbonate sand and rubble \n\nplains, large blocks, and also some vertical walls with small crevices at their base. The \n\n\n\nChapter 3- Discussion \n\n89 \n\n \n\npresence of calcareous algae and some sponges is also frequent (Feitoza, 1999). \n\nHowever, the large resemblance between the deep and the natural reefs, in the analysis \n\nof reef associated species, might prove that even being distant and in an environment \n\nwith different characteristics, the deeper reefs can also function as shallow reefs, posing \n\nboth as shelter and nursery areas for some deep reef species (e.g., Boland &amp; Parrish, \n\n2005; Brokovich et al., 2007).  \n\nRegarding the number of species that distinguish different reefs, the largest \n\ndensities were found in the shallow reefs (mentioned earlier), for species that \n\ncharacterize shallow and intermediary reefs and also for species present in all reefs.  \n\nThe waters in the northeastern coast of Brazil show a relatively stable \n\ntemperature throughout the year with values ranging from 26\u00baC in the winter, to 30\u00baC in \n\nthe summertime (Medeiros &amp; Ara\u00fajo Filho, in press). This might explain the large \n\ndistribution of species in the reefs over the continental shelf as a consequence of the \n\nlow temperature gap, as temperature is known to be the major factor influencing \n\nmarine life (Lowe-McConnell, 1999). Environmental stability has also been used to \n\nexplain the rise of diversity, both taxonomic and morphological, on reef fishes from \n\nshallow tropical seas (Choat &amp; Bellwood, 1991; Bellwood &amp; Wainwright, 2002; Floeter et \n\nal., 2004). \n\nAlthough several studies have highlighted the importance of reef structure on \n\nstructuring the fish community (Luckhurst &amp; Luckhurst, 1978; Gladfelter et al., 1980;), \n\nthis study suggests that depth is a key factor in this process. Although no natural \n\nintermediate reefs were sampled off Recife\u2019s coast, it can be inferred that the main fish \n\nsource were not the shallow reefs but other natural/ artificial reefs in the area, for the \n\ncomposition of the fish fauna on the intermediate depth reefs was somewhat distinct of \n\nthe natural coastal reefs and very similar among the several vessel reefs. \n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFINAL REMARKS \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\nThe present work was part of a project which was the first to inventory the reef \n\nfish species present in three intentionally deployed vessel reefs, in the state of \n\nPernambuco, and to study their community structure, diversity as well as the trophic \n\nand spatial distribution of the species present, including the changes in species \n\ncomposition for approximately one year.  \n\n Community diversity \n\nBy the comparison of the ichthyofaunal communities present in the three \n\nvessels, it was possible to conclude that these reefs had a fish community typical of \n\nreefs in the northeastern coast of Brazil, with most of the reef fish families that occur in \n\nthem being also present in the vessel reefs (Chapter 1 and 3). The diversity indices used \n\nin the present work showed rich and diverse fish communities in all three vessels, with \n\nmore dynamic species regulation processes in the shallower and smaller vessel, \n\nprobably resulting from resources pressure (i.e. limited shelter and/ or food) and even \n\nanthropological impact, since this last vessel had a higher diving intensity than the \n\nothers (Chapter 1). \n\nTrophic guilds \n\nThe trophic guilds were very similar for the three vessels, with the main \n\ndifferences being found between the smaller/ shallower vessel and the two larger/ \n\ndeeper ones. As previously reported, the main differences were found for a) the \n\nplanktivores, with a greater abundance on the deeper vessel, which is in agreement \n\nwith other studies in the area and on vessel reefs in general; b) mobile invertebrate \n\nfeeders, which, in spite of being more abundant in the shallower vessel, were the \n\nsecond most abundant trophic group in the other two deeper reefs; c) omnivores, \n\nwhose greater abundance in the deeper and diver free vessel is an observable effect of \n\nthe presence of medium sized schools (<200 individuals); and d) territorial herbivores \n\nwhich showed a larger abundance in the shallower reef, although with much smaller \n\nvalues than the ones usually found in natural reefs (Chapter 1).  \n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\nThe continuous analysis of the trophic patterns throughout the colonization \n\nprocess allowed the identification of important changes in the number of species in \n\neach trophic guild. The main changes were related to species that were heavily present \n\nfrom the beginning of the dives, such as roving herbivores and mobile invertebrate \n\nfeeders, and to those whose numbers increased through time, like the omnivores and \n\nplanktivores (Chapter 2). These results show that some species have a higher \n\ndependence on the resources offered by the reefs (e.g. territorial herbivores) and that, \n\nas time passes by, the community fulfills all trophic guilds creating an intertwined web \n\nof relationships among different species with different needs. Thus, it could be inferred \n\nthat the pioneer species for fish colonization on an artificial reef are those that can \n\nforage and move large distances from the reef to feed, returning to the reef for shelter. \n\nSpatial distribution of species \n\nThe use of spatial categories to group the species in the present work had two \n\nmain purposes: to allow comparisons with the distribution patterns and similarities \n\nfound in different fish communities, and to evaluate the visual census methodology as a \n\ntool to identify the species in the colonization process of an artificial reef. \n\nThe cluster analysis applied to the data on spatial distribution, in the two deeper \n\nvessels, showed a clear separation between the first dives and the remaining ones, using \n\nall species and type B species (i.e. species that maintain visual contact with the reef and \n\nswim around it). This pattern is expected as these species are conspicuous by their color \n\nand shape and are considered to be \u201cneutral species\u201d. However, this pattern was not \n\nobserved for the pelagic, type C, and reef/ substrate attached species, types A and D, \n\nwhich are species known to flee or hide at divers\u2019 approximation. While most pelagic \n\nspecies are considered occasional species, type A and D species are usually species that \n\nexhibit camouflage characteristics, being sometimes very hard to spot (Chapter 2). \n\nDespite the inadequate temporal scale offered by these three last spatial distributions, \n\nas the dives in the cluster analysis were mixed, these species could show different \n\npatterns, in the vessel reef opened for recreational diving and the one closed, providing \n\nvaluable information for posterior studies regarding species presence in artificial reefs. \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\n Sampling limitations \n\nMany of the analyses in this study were made using species presence/ absence \n\ndata, especially the ones comparing different reefs and sites (Chapter 2 and 3). Such an \n\napproach was adopted because the main objective of this work was to study the \n\nevolution of the colonization process and to compare it with other reefs, in relation to \n\nthe number of species in each trophic and spatial category. Although the communities \n\nstudied were still experiencing some species regulating processes (Chapter 1), the work \n\nconcluded that the species composition already resembled the ones found in natural \n\nreefs (Chapter 3). Another purpose of this study was to evaluate the ecological pattern \n\nof the colonization process of two recently deployed vessels and to understand the \n\navailable resources the reef offered, based on the differential niche use (Chapter 2). \n\nOne of the main limitations of this study was the presence of large abundances \n\nof some reef-attached species, like Haemulon aurolineatum and H. squamipinna. The \n\nmassive abundance of Haemulids has already been described for other artificial reefs \n\n(Randall, 1963; Smith et al., 1979; Wolf et al., 1983, Thanner et al., 2006), so a way to \n\nbetter estimate their abundance (e.g. video transects), in the vessel reefs, is clearly \n\nneeded. Another intrinsic limitation of the present work was the existence of only one \n\nnatural reef at intermediate depth, versus eight vessel reefs, and no artificial reef in \n\nshallow and deeper areas (Chapter 3), which greatly hindered the comparison between \n\ndifferent types and depths of reefs. Although the pattern found resembles the results \n\nfrom other studies on artificial reefs, it was difficult to ascertain which factor, i.e. depth \n\nor type of reef, had the main influence on the fish assemblages. \n\nCan Artificial Reefs function as natural reefs? \n\nThe use of artificial reefs to create productive ecosystems in damaged or \n\nunproductive areas is a commonly used reason for the deployment of several types of \n\nreefs. As a consequence, much emphasis has been given to the attraction/ production of \n\nartificial reefs, with many of these efforts being put into work to evaluate the fishing \n\npotential of these types of structures (Solonski, 1985; Powers et al., 2003; Santos &amp; \n\nMonteiro, 2007; Whitmarsh et al., 2008). However, in this study, the main purpose was \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\nnot to evaluate the fishing or productive potential but to observe the possible changes \n\nin the community composition of the three vessel reefs along the first year, after \n\ndeployment. As such, from the ecological data gathered in relation to trophic and spatial \n\ngroups, the vessel reefs showed typical communities and behavioral patterns found in \n\nother studies in the northeastern coast of Brazil (e.g. Feitoza, 2001; Engmann, 2006; \n\nSouza et al., 2007). Even when compared to natural reefs, the artificial vessel reefs \n\nshowed a greater similarity with reefs located in different geographical areas but at \n\nsimilar depths, than with reefs located in the same area but at different depths. This \n\nshows that the regulation processes acting on species composition are similar in both \n\nnatural and artificial reefs.  \n\nCoral-reef fishes strongly associate with features of habitat structure (e.g., Jones \n\n&amp; Syms, 1998), and two opposed views exist regarding the critical aspects of coral reef \n\nhabitats. Some authors defend the importance of coral cover on fish distribution and \n\nabundance (e.g., Munday, 2002; Garpe &amp; \u00d6hman, 2003; Jones et al., 2004), while others \n\nrelate abundance and diversity of coral-reef fishes to spatial and temporal variation in \n\ntopographic complexity (e.g., Luckhurst &amp; Luckhurst, 1978; Gratwicke &amp; Speight, 2005), \n\narguing that fish communities are more influenced by the existence of multidimensional \n\ntopographical complexity than by the presence of corals in the area (Toller, 2002).  \n\nEven though artificial, coral and rocky reefs provide increased surface area for \n\nthe attachment of primary and secondary producers, it is well known that no artificial \n\nreef surface can provide even an infinitesimal part of overall surface area available in \n\nthe natural surrounding environment (Bortone et al., 2000). However, that structural \n\ncomplexity can be enlarged by sessile invertebrates that attract and support other \n\norganisms that depend on them, both for food or shelter (Jones et al., 1997). \n\nCoral reef communities are extremely diverse and variable, and we should not \n\nexpect that the relationships between reef organisms or the dynamics of the system to \n\nbe simple to understand (Szmant-Froelich, 1983). However, knowledge of the nutrient \n\ncycle can be indicative of the productivity of a reef.  \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\nWhile dissolved nutrients and some particulates are taken up by organisms such \n\nas algae and zooxanthellae, other particulates are mostly trapped by the reef\u2019s filter \n\nfeeding organisms. Planktivorous fish also concentrate particulates and excrete large \n\namounts of organic material in their nocturnal shelters (Szmant-Froelich, 1983). \n\nSimilarly, mobile invertebrate feeders, which account for a large proportion of reef fish \n\nbiomass, forage diurnally and nocturnally over large areas (Wolf et al. 1983; Moura &amp; \n\nFrancini-Filho, 2005) and release nutrients onto the reef, which can also enhance coral \n\ngrowth (Meyer &amp; Schultz 1985). Mobile invertebrate feeders, herbivores, and even \n\nother carnivorous and piscivorous species, are all important elements in the nutrient \n\ncycle of the reef, redistributing nutrients from adjacent habitats, for mobile invertebrate \n\nfeeders and roving herbivores, as well as producing energy and nutrient-rich feces that \n\nenrich the reef environment and other reef-dependent organism (Choat &amp; Bellwood, \n\n1991). \n\nAs previously mentioned, in the three vessels reefs it was possible to see all \n\ntypes of species, from the ones that migrate to forage in other areas, like roving \n\nherbivores and mobile invertebrate feeders, to the ones that eat other fishes, such as \n\ncarnivores and piscivores, and even species that take advantage of resources in the \n\nsurrounding environment, such as planktivores. In addition to that, the presence of \n\nspecies belonging to all different spatial categories, from pelagic to site-attached \n\nspecies, also shows the amount of different resources available in the reefs. \n\nAn artificial reef undergoes a life cycle, which begins with the installation \n\nprocess, progresses to a period of maximum colonization effect and then it gradually \n\nmoves into a phase of structural aging, after which the artificial reef reaches a level of \n\ncomplexity close to a natural reef (Sato, 1985). Arena et al. (2007), comparing several \n\nvessel reefs with different ages, concluded that, as time passes by, the fish community \n\npresent in each vessel becomes closer to the ones observed in natural reefs. In the \n\npresent study, however, high similarities were observed between all vessel reefs in the \n\nsame area, regardless of age, which indicates that the colonization process in the \n\nnortheastern coast of Brazil is a rapid event. Even though is has been previously argued \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n\n \n\nthat this sudden process may show a \u201crelevant attraction effect to fishes\u201d (Bohnsack &amp; \n\nSutherland, 1985), there is no question that the vessel reefs off Recife have self-\n\nregulating and complex communities resembling natural reefs, independently of the \n\ninitial attraction/ aggregation and migration of fishes from  nearby reefs. \n\nAll these results confirm the hypothesis that artificial reefs do support new fish \n\nassemblages, being able to offer food and shelter, within a structural complexity \n\ncomparable to those found in natural reefs (Bohnsack, 1989; Solonsky, 1985). And no \n\nmatter how attractive an area may be in terms of food supply, it will only be able to \n\nsupport large number of fishes if it can offer shelter (Randall, 1963; Ehrlich, 1975) as \n\nwell many other biological requirements, emanating from the biological relationships \n\namongst species.  \n\nAs a final note, the economic benefits arising from ecotourism and SCUBA diving \n\nin these vessel reefs can show that, as pointed out by Brock (1994), this may be the \n\nmost economically, as well as ecologically, viable use of an artificial reef. However, \n\ntaking into account the actual exhaustion of natural marine resources worldwide, with \n\nno exception to the northeastern Brazil, I hope this study may serve as a comparative \n\nbase for, in a future context, studies focused on the productivity of artificial reefs in this \n\nregion. \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAbelson, A. 2006.
