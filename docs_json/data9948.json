A aplica\u00e7\u00e3o eficaz desta \ntecnologia \u00e9, no entanto, muitas vezes limitada pela natureza hidrof\u00f3bica dos \ncontaminantes. O recurso a estirpes bacterianas simultaneamente \ndegradadoras de hidrocarbonetos e produtoras de biossurfactantes apresenta \num enorme potencial na reciclagem de compostos hidrof\u00f3bicos. Assim, o \nobjectivo deste trabalho consistiu em avaliar o potencial biotecnol\u00f3gico do \nsistema estuarino da Ria de Aveiro quanto \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de bact\u00e9rias \nhidrocarbonocl\u00e1sticas produtoras de biossurfactantes e a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rias \ncombina\u00e7\u00f5es de in\u00f3culos ambientais e fontes de carbono para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de \nisolados bacterianos de interesse.  \nPara tal foram realizadas experi\u00eancias em meios selectivos (diesel, crude e \nparafina) a partir de in\u00f3culos de diferentes matrizes ambientais: amostras da \nmicrocamada superficial (SML), sedimentos estuarinos e rizosfera de bancos \nde Halimione portulacoides, uma planta hal\u00f3fita dos sapais da Ria de Aveiro. O \ndesenvolvimento da cultura ao longo do per\u00edodo de incuba\u00e7\u00e3o foi avaliado pela \ncontagem de unidades formadoras de col\u00f3nias (CFUs). A cultura selectiva com \nmaior teor de bact\u00e9rias cultiv\u00e1veis foi a de crude-sedimento e aquela em que a \nabund\u00e2ncia bacteriana foi mais baixa foi a de diesel-rizosfera. A partir da \nan\u00e1lise dos perfis de DGGE dos fragmentos do gene 16s rRNA do DNA total \nextra\u00eddo das culturas selectivas verificou-se que no fim do per\u00edodo de \nincuba\u00e7\u00e3o, o grau de semelhan\u00e7a entre as comunidades bacterianas das \nculturas selectivas \u00e9 relativamente baixo. Pelo \u00edndice de diversidade de \nShannon-Weaver a maior diversidade estrutural das comunidades bacterianas \nencontra-se nas culturas selectivas de parafina (2,5231), seguidas das de \ncrude (2.2509) e das de diesel (1.6727). Das culturas selectivas, foi obtido um \nconjunto de isolados que foi testado quanto \u00e0 capacidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \nbiossurfactantes pelo m\u00e9todo atomized oil. De 66 isolados testados, 17 \nproduziram resultado positivo (25,8%), sendo a \u00e1gua da SML a matriz \nambiental com melhores resultados e o diesel a melhor fonte de carbono para \no isolamento de bact\u00e9rias produtoras de biossurfactantes. \nTendo em conta o elevado n\u00famero de isolados obtidos e a percentagem de \nprodutores de biossurfactantes, pode concluir-se que na Ria de Aveiro, \nparticularmente na SML, existem comunidades bacterianas adaptadas \u00e0 \nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o se substratos hidrof\u00f3bicos, com uma boa representa\u00e7\u00e3o de \nprodutores de biossurfactantes.

However most bacteria used in this processes, \nwhile being able to degrade a wide range of the oil hydrocarbons, have limited \naction due to the low water solubility of these compounds. Hence, a possible \nsolution for this problem would be the use of biosurfactant-producing bacteria, \nsince the presence of surfactants help improve the hydrocarbons dispersal, \nsolubilization and bioavailability. The objective of this work was to assess the \nbiotechnological potential of Ria de Aveiro estuarine system regarding the \npresence of hydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producing bacteria and to \nevaluate different combinations of environmental inocula and carbon sources \nfor the isolation of biosurfactants producing bacteria. \nSelective cultures (diesel, crude and paraffin) were prepared using inocula from \ndifferent environmental matrixes: samples from the surface microlayer (SML), \nbulk estuarine sediments and sediments of the rhizosphere of Halimione \nportulacoides, a characteristic halophyte from the salt marshes of Ria de \nAveiro. During the incubation period, the development of the selective cultures \nwas assessed by quantification of colony forming units (CFU). The highest \nvalue of CFU was obtained in the crude-sediment culture, while the lowest \nvalue was found with the diesel-rhizosphere combination. The DGGE profiles of \nthe 16s rRNA gene fragments of the total community DNA extracted at the end \nof the incubation of the selective cultures, show that communities were different \nin terms of structural diversity. The values of the Shannon-Weaver index of \ndiversity indicate that the higher diversity was achieved in the selective cultures \nwith paraffin as carbon source (2.5231), followed by the crude oil (2.2509), and \ndiesel (1.6726) selective cultures. From the selective cultures, 111 presumably \nhydrocarbonoclastic isolates were obtained after isolation and purification. Of \nthese, 66 were tested for biosurfactant production by the atomized oil assay, \nwith positive results for 17 isolates (25.8%). The environmental matrix with best \nresults was the SML water and diesel was the most effective carbon source.  \nHaving in consideration the high number of isolates obtained from the selective \ncultures and the percentage of biosurfactant producers, the estuarine system of \nRia the Aveiro, and in particular the SML, can be regarded as an  interesting \nseedbank for the prospection of hydrocarbonoclastic and biosurfactants \nproducing bacteria. The SML microhabitat shows particularly high \nbiotechnological potential for the isolation of bacterial strains with interesting \nproperties for application in bioremediation strategies in coastal and estuarine \nareas. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\ni \n \n \n \n \n\nIndex \n\nList of Images ...................................................................................................................................... iii \n\nList of Tables ........................................................................................................................................ v \n\nAbbreviation Index ............................................................................................................................. vi \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\n\n\n \n\n1 Introduction \n\n1.1 Petroleum and its products \n\nPetroleum is a form of bitumen\n1\n composed mainly of hydrocarbons and in nature is found \n\nin gaseous or liquid state, with crude oil, being the liquid part of petroleum [1]. \n\nThe composition and characteristics of different types of crude oil vary considerably \n\ndepending on the origin and age of the oil fields. These differences are due to the fact that \n\nalthough each kind of crude oil contains basically the same hydrocarbon compounds, the \n\nproportion of these hydrocarbons varies considerably from one crude to another [2].  \n\nCrude oil is a heterogeneous liquid, consisting of hydrocarbons comprised almost entirely \n\nof the elements hydrogen and carbon in the ratio of 1.85:1 respectively. It also contains elements \n\nsuch as nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen, all of which constitute less than 3 % (v/v). There are also \n\ntrace constituents, comprising less than 1 % (v/v), including phosphorous and heavy metals such \n\nas vanadium and nickel [1, 3]. The smallest hydrocarbon molecule in crude oil is methane \n\n(MW=16) and the largest are asphaltenes, with molecular weights in the tens of thousands. In \n\nbetween these two compounds there are thousands of others with a wide range of structural \n\ncomplexity: alkanes (or paraffins), cycloalkanes (or naphthenes or cycloparaffins), alkenes (or \n\nolefins), and arenes (or aromatics) [1]. \n\nThe main characteristics of heavy hydrocarbons, such as those found in crude oils and \n\nheavy fuels, are variable density, low biodegradability, low solubility, low volatility, high viscosity \n\nand high sorption in soils. On the other hand, commercial hydrocarbons, which are lighter and are \n\nfound in petrol and diesel fuel, have lower density than water, have higher biodegradability, \n\ngenerally have low solubility, although some fractions can be more soluble than others, highly or \n\nmoderately volatile, low to medium viscosity and variable sorption in soils [4]. \n\nDiesel fuel is a product of petroleum distillation and contains on average 90 % aliphatic \n\nhydrocarbons and 10 % aromatic compounds. The most soluble fractions makes up to \n\napproximately 5 % by volume. It is possible to find very small traces of the following potentially \n\ndangerous compounds: benzene, toluene, xylenes and ethylbenzene [4]. More specifically, some \n\n                                                           \n1\n  \u201cNative substances of variable color, hardness, and volatility, composed principally of the elements \n\ncarbon and hydrogen and sometimes associated with mineral matter, the nonmineral constituents being \nlargely soluble in carbon disulfide\u201d [1].  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n  Introduction \n\n9 \n \n \n \n\n \n\nbatches of marine diesel oil (Table 1), a product of variable toxicity, can have a very high content \n\nof aromatic fractions (40 % or more). Other toxic materials such as phenols and sulphur \n\ncompounds may also be present [5]. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Specifications of Marine Diesel (Adapted from [2]) \n\nProperty Typical value \n\nFlash point (PM closed) 338.7 K (min.) \n\nCarbon residue 1.5 (max.) \n\nSulphur % wt 1.8 (max.) \n\nCetane number 30-58 \n\nViscosity at 310.9 K 1.7-11.5 cSt \n\nASTM distillation \u2013 90 % point 588.7-658.2 K \n\n \n\n1.2 Petroleum spillages and oil bioremediation approaches  \n\nPetroleum and its products are \n\nused at a global scale in almost all sort \n\nof modern activities. Such widespread \n\nuse requires its constant \n\ntransportation, which ultimately results \n\nin accidental or intentional leakages to \n\nthe environment (Figure 1). The major \n\ncauses for accidental oil spills are oil \n\nwell blowouts, maritime accidents, \n\npipeline ruptures, and explosions or \n\nleakages at storage facilities [6]. On the other hand, intentional releases such as operational \n\ndischarges, that are often small, deliberate and \u201croutine\u201d, can in most cases be controlled and/or \n\navoided [7].  \n\nThe extent of the environmental and socio-economical impacts caused by an accidental \n\noil spill can be determined by several factors [7]: \n\n? The amount, rate and type of oil spilled; \n\n? The location and the political and legal issues in place (which can influence the choice of \n\nthe clean-up strategy adopted); \n\n? The vicinity to sensitive resources; \n\nFigure 1 - Possible sources of oil spillage. MDO \u2013 Marine \ndiesel oil [6]. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n\n10 \n \n \n \n \n\n? The choice and effectiveness of cleanup strategies. \n\nOil spills are one of major causes of ocean pollution caused by maritime transport of \n\npetroleum products, which most of the times end in ecological disasters of wide public concern \n\n[8, 9]. The resulting black tides can affect the environment in several ways. Although the groups \n\nthat suffer the most are mainly birds, fish, sea mammals and several marine invertebrate species, \n\ndue to negative effects in their physiology, immunology and development [10-12], some black \n\ntides can affect whole aquatic food chains [13]. As a consequence, oil spill can result in an \n\naccentuated decrease or disappearance of populations of marine fauna and flora within the \n\naffected area [14]. \n\nOn land, the contamination of soils with petroleum or its products leads to a decrease on \n\nfood productivity since it affects the germination and growth of some plants, as well as soil \n\nfertility [15, 16]. Also, crude oil contamination of land affects certain parameters of the soil, such \n\nas the mineral and organic matter content, the cation exchange capacity, the redox properties,  \n\nand the pH [17]. \n\nAlthough large oil spills have higher ecological impacts than small scale events, it is also \n\ncommon for the later to have disastrous consequences in endangered species, especially when \n\nthey occur in pristine areas [18]. It is also worth mentioning that, besides  environmental damage, \n\nthere are also the consequential high costs to fisheries, agriculture, related industries, and \n\ntourism in the affected areas [19].  \n\nAccidental spills have prompted the development of methodologies to deal with the \n\nresulting oil pollution both at sea and on land. These can be physical or chemical methods such as \n\nthose illustrated in Figure 2, which are fairly well established, or biotechnological methods, which \n\nin the past decade have been subject to much debate and increasing research efforts. The later \n\ninclude such methods as the use of straw or plant material as an absorbent for oil, biosurfactants \n\nto clean oiled surfaces [20], biological polymers to coat surfaces and to prevent oil adhesion, and \n\nthe addition of materials [21] (microorganisms or nutrients/fertilizers) to stimulate \n\nmicrobiological biodegradation of oil [22, 23].  \n\nThis last procedure, also known as bioremediation, can be defined as the process of \n\nadding materials (nutrients - biostimulation or microorganisms - bioaugmentation) to \n\ncontaminated environments under controlled conditions to cause an acceleration of the natural \n\nbiodegradation processes until the contaminated site becomes innocuous or the contaminant \n\nreaches levels below the concentration limits established by the regulatory authorities [21, 24].  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n  Introduction \n\n11 \n \n \n \n\n \n\nSuccessful bioremediation strategies can be a fairly complete solution to oil \n\ncontamination, since the contaminants are converted into microbial biomass, water, and gases, \n\nprimarily carbon dioxide, which form part of the carbon cycle [5, 25].  Physical methodologies only \n\ntransfer the contaminant from one environmental compartment to another. For example, \n\nalthough some oil physically recovered from beaches may be recycled, in many cases it is stored \n\nin pits or landfills [22]. Additionally, in terms of the biota, bioremediation is one of the few \n\nprocesses that will actually remove toxic components from the environment. In fact, some field \n\nstudies suggest that the natural rates of oil biodegradation on coastal shorelines can be \n\nstimulated two- to sevenfold by bioremediation strategies [22]. Nevertheless, it should be noted \n\nthat bioremediation strategies are much slower to effectively remove the oil than intensive \n\nphysical cleaning methods [22]. In cases of oil spills at sea, oil biodegradation rates are not \n\nsufficiently high, even when stimulated by the addition of nutrients or competent \n\nmicroorganisms, which makes this strategy unlikely to be used as a first response in these cases \n\n[26].  Bioremediation is also not the most adequate strategy to apply in cases where there are \n\nimportant environmental and/or political reasons to proceed with a quick decontamination. \n\nHowever, treatment options of the contaminated site should be considered regarding the overall \n\nbenefits for the environment, weighting the gains of oil removal against the consequences of the \n\ncleanup strategy in each particular situation [22]. In this aspect, bioremediation tends to perform \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Oil spill physical and chemical clean-up methods: a) beach clean-up by substratum removal; b) \nself-cleaning high energy shore; c) dispersant/surfactant spraying at the sea; d)booms protect cooling water \nintakes of industries and e) fish farms; f) hand cutting of oiled vegetation [127]. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n\n12 \n \n \n \n \n\nwell, considering that its application can usually be conducted at low cost, with limited personnel, \n\nand with relatively little or no environmental impact [24, 27]. \n\nThe success of bioremediation strategies depends on several factors. The most relevant \n\nare the type of contaminated matrix (soil/water), the penetration of the fertilizer and/or \n\nmicroorganisms in the impacted environment, the presence and concentration of biodegradable \n\npetroleum hydrocarbons in oil, the presence of other toxic compounds besides crude oil \n\ncomponents, the level of available oxygen and nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, the \n\nbiodiversity of hydrocarbonoclastic and cometabolising bacteria on site, the nature of the \n\nbioremediation product, and the prevailing environmental conditions, particularly temperature \n\nand pH [17, 22]. Oil-degrading microorganisms are ubiquitous in the environment [28, 29]. \n\nHowever, according to some studies, there is not a single microbial species that has the enzymatic \n\nability to metabolize more than two or three classes of compounds typically found in a crude oil \n\n[30]. Therefore, consortia of several different bacterial species are often required to achieve \n\nsignificant levels of crude oil degradation after a spill [22]. Bioaugmentation strategies, involving a \n\nconsortium of bacteria, are preferred to biostimulation in cases where pollutant toxicity or a lack \n\nof appropriate microorganisms, both in quantity and in quality, is important. The potential success \n\nof such strategy requires an understanding of the survival and activity of the added \n\nmicroorganism(s) and their genetics, as well as the knowledge of the general environmental \n\nconditions that control the biodegradation rates [23].  \n\n1.3 Oil-degrading bacteria  \n\n Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are widely distributed in marine habitats. Still, their roles \n\nin a natural marine environment or in oil-contaminated sites, with or without treatments such as \n\nthe addition of fertilizers to enhance microbial activity, are largely unknown [31]. Some studies \n\nhave shown that the introduction of oil or oil constituents into seawater leads to successive \n\nblooms of a relatively limited number of indigenous marine bacterial genera, usually obligate \n\nhydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB) (e.g. Alcanivorax), which are present at low or undetectable \n\nlevels before the polluting event [32, 33]. As result, there is an increase of the degradation rate of \n\nmany oil constituents, a process that can be accelerated further by the addition of the limiting \n\nnutrients [34]. Marine hydrocarbon degraders are usually highly specialized obligate hydrocarbon \n\nusers, while  terrestrial hydrocarbon degraders are more likely to be metabolically versatile and \n\nutilize a large range of organic substrates [31]. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n  Introduction \n\n13 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n Some of the most common bacteria found in oil-impacted marine environments belong to \n\nthe genus Alcanivorax, and have been proven to be important to the biodegradation of \n\npetroleum, especially under bioremediation conditions [35]. These Gram-negative marine \n\nbacteria are known to produce biosurfactants when using n-alkanes as substrate [36]. \n\nAdditionally, they cannot use carbohydrates and amino acids as growth substrates [37]. \n\nAlcanivorax borkumensis is considered the paradigm of OHCB, and as such, its genome \n\nsequencing and functional genomic analysis has proven to be very helpful in understanding the \n\ngenomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization, the metabolic \n\npathways used in hydrocarbon degradation, and its ecological success [31]. \n\n Other bacterial genera already known for their capacity to degrade hydrocarbons are \n\nPseudomonas, Marinobacter, Microbulbifer, Sphingomonas, Micrococcus, Cellulomonas, Dietzia \n\nand Gordonia [23]. \n\n The biodegradation potential of microorganisms is dependent of its genetic \n\ncharacteristics. Plasmids are thought to play a leading role in this aspect, since the ability to \n\ndegrade more recalcitrant components of petroleum are generally plasmid generated [38]. \n\nAlthough catabolic plasmids are non-vital genetic elements, they provide a metabolic versatility \n\nnot normally present in the cell (Table 2). Additionally, many of the bacterial catabolic pathways \n\nare associated to conjugative plasmids [39]. Since these plasmids are readily transferred laterally \n\nPlasmid Host Compound(s) catabolised \n\nTOL Pseudomonas putida \n\n \n\nToluene, p- and m-xylene \n\nNAH Naphthalene \n\nSAL Salicylate \n\npND50 p-cresol \n\npWW31 Phenylacetate \n\npRE1 Isopropyl benzene \n\npAC25 3-chlorobenzoate \n\npAC21 Pseudomonas sp. \n\n \n\n4- chlorobiphenol \n\npCIT1 Aniline \n\npWR1 3-chlorobenzoate \n\npCS1 Pseudomonas diminuta Parathion \n\npJP1 Alcaligenes paradoxa 2,3- dichlorophenoxyacetic acid \n\npJP4 Alcaligenes eutrophus 2,4- dichlorophenoxyacetate and 3- chlorobenzoate \n\npKF1 Acinetobacter sp. 4- chlorobiphenol \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Plasmids encoding catabolic functions [3]. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n\n14 \n \n \n \n \n\ninto new host bacteria, other members of the community will acquire new degradation abilities \n\nleading to an increase of the metabolic potential in the ecosystem. It is such genetic potential that \n\nallows the evolution of integrated and regulated pathways for the degradation of hydrocarbons. \n\nTherefore, in an environment rich in a particular organic compound, the selective pressure may \n\nlead to the acquisition and maintenance of plasmids that encode the corresponding catabolic \n\npathway [23]. For that reason, it is common to find degraders of exotic compounds in \n\nenvironments contaminated with such compounds. In some cases, the same catabolic genes may \n\nbe located on a plasmid in one organism and on the chromosome in another, and these catabolic \n\ngenes may influence the expression of other sets of catabolic genes present in the same cell [40]. \n\n1.3.1 Microbial degradation of oil hydrocarbons \n\nPetroleum oil biodegradation by bacteria can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic \n\nconditions, although by the action of different consortia of organisms. In both cases an exogenous \n\nelectron acceptor is needed for the degradation of hydrocarbons (being fully reduced substrates) \n\nby the microorganisms. In aerobic conditions, this electron acceptor is oxygen in the initial attack, \n\nand in most cases, also the electron acceptor of the subsequent steps [23]. In the subsurface, \n\nwhere there is low availability of molecular oxygen, oil biodegradation occurs primarily under \n\nanaerobic conditions. In these cases, biodegradation of partially oxygenated intermediates is \n\nmainly mediated by sulphate or nitrate reducing bacteria, or other anaerobes using other kinds of \n\nelectron acceptors as the oxidant [23, 41]. Petroleum hydrocarbons are known to persist under \n\nstrict anaerobic conditions, however in certain types of coastal marine sediments, under sulphate-\n\nreducing conditions some of these compounds are degraded. This kind of sediment when used to \n\ninoculate sediment that does not present the ability to degrade hydrocarbons under anaerobic \n\nconditions, induces the degradation of such components. This leads to believe that hydrocarbon \n\ncontamination could be treated under sulphate-reducing conditions and that the inoculation with \n\nforeign microorganisms or equivalent samples of anaerobic microbial consortia adapted to \n\nspecific hydrocarbons would be effective to stimulate the anaerobic biodegradation of these \n\nhydrocarbons [42, 43]. \n\nThe inherent biodegradability of petroleum hydrocarbons depends on the chemical \n\nstructures, physical state and toxicity of the compounds. For example, while n-alkanes are the \n\ngroup of petroleum components more readily biodegradable, the C5-C10 homologues are toxic to \n\nthe majority of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, since as solvents they tend to disrupt lipid \n\nmembrane structures of microorganisms [44]. The fact that petroleum hydrocarbons, both in \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n  Introduction \n\n15 \n \n \n \n\n \n\ncrude oil and in refined products, occurs in complex mixtures, also affects the biodegradation rate \n\nof each component. This can have a positive or negative effect in the overall degradation process. \n\nIn certain cases, some iso-alkanes are spared as long as n-alkanes are available as substrates, \n\nwhile, on other cases, some condensed aromatics are metabolized only in the presence of more \n\neasily utilisable petroleum hydrocarbons, a process referred to as co-metabolism [45]. \n\nAs mentioned before there is a certain ubitiquity of gene clusters for the degradation of n-\n\nalkanes and (poly)aromatic fractions of oil in bacteria (Figure 3). For instance the alkSB1GHJ gene \n\ncluster, which encodes for enzymes involved in the degradation of n-alkanes, is present in A. \n\nborkumensis strain SK2 as well as in several other bacteria [31]. The alkSB1GHJ clusters of \n\nMarinobacter aquaeolei and Oceanocaulis alexandrii are flanked by putative transposase genes \n\nwhich is consistent with a previous observation that gene clusters for alkane degradation can be \n\ntransferred among bacteria via mobile genetic elements [46].  \n\nAs with alkanes, there is a similarity in the organization of genes associated to the \n\ndegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons amongst different species of bacteria. Sequence analysis of \n\nCycloclasticus sp. A5 revealed a cluster of phn genes involved in the degradation of naphthalene, \n\nmethylnaphthalene, phenanthrene and dibenzothiophene. The phnA1, phnA2, phnA3 and phnA4 \n\ngenes encode, PAH dioxygenase, the enzyme involved in initial step of the degradation pathway \n\n[47].  PAHs possessing four or more fused aromatic rings have very low water solubility and tend \n\nto be adsorbed to solid surfaces. These characteristics make them recalcitrant to biodegradation. \n\nHowever, some Mycobacteria and Sphingomonas are known to degrade these heavier PAHs [3, \n\n35]. On the other hand, cycloalkanes, are degraded by a co-oxidation mechanism. These \n\ncompounds are transformed by an oxygenase system to a corresponding cyclic alcohol, which is \n\ndehydrated into a cyclic ketone. Then, a monooxygenase system lactonises the ring, which is \n\nsubsequently cleaved by lactone hydrolase. However, the two oxygenase systems usually never \n\noccur in the same organism, which makes necessary the use of synergistic actions by microbial \n\ncommunities to degrade cycloalkanes [48]. The degradation of substituted cycloalkanes seems to \n\nbe less difficult than that of unsubstituted cycloalkanes [35].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n\n16 \n \n \n \n \n\n1.3.2 Methods of isolation and characterization of oil-degrading bacteria \n\nThe initial method to isolate and identify petroleum-degrading microorganisms involved \n\nthe use of hydrocarbons incorporated into agar-based medium [30]. The major problem of this \n\napproach is that in some studies, only a low percentage of the isolates from agar-based media \n\ncould be demonstrated to actually be capable of hydrocarbon utilisation [23]. Therefore it is \n\nadvisable to use media without agar, for example, silica-gel oil medium, as well as to have counts \n\nof petroleum degraders be expressed as a percentage of the total population rather than as total \n\nnumbers of petroleum degraders per se  [49].  \n\nAn alternative to the plate technique for the estimation of hydrocarbon is the Most \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Ubiquity of gene clusters among several bacterial species for the degradation of aliphatic \nfractions of oil. Organization of genes homologous to the A. borkumensis alk gene cluster in hydrocarbon-\ndegrading marine proteobacteria. Homologous genes are highlighted by shaded areas: sequences predicted \nto code for LuxR-type transcriptional activators of the alkane genes, AlkS, are marked in green, genes for \nthe alkane degradation pathway are indicated in blue, and transposase-related sequences are shown in red. \nPercentages of protein identity/similarity of polypeptides from A. borkumensis with those of M. aquaeolei \nand O. alexandrii are shown. Gene designations: alkB1, alkane monooxygenase; alkG, rubredoxin; alkJ, \nalcohol dehydrogenase; alkH, aldehyde dehydrogenase [31]. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n  Introduction \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\n \n\nProbable Number procedure, since it eliminates the need for a solidifying agent and allows the \n\ndirect assessment of the ability to actually utilise hydrocarbons. It also has the advantage that the \n\nuse of liquid media permits removal of trace organic contaminants and allows for the chemical \n\ndefinition of a medium with just a kind of hydrocarbon as carbon source. For these reasons, this \n\ntechnique allows to specifically count only hydrocarbon users as well as eliminate the problem of \n\ncounting organism growing on other trace organic contaminants [50]. \n\nAlthough standard culture methods are adequate for the evaluation of the ability of \n\nindigenous bacteria to degrade contaminants, a significant problem of culture techniques is the \n\nfact that most (90-99 %) of the species making up competent degrading communities do not form \n\ncolonies when laboratory-based culture techniques are used [51]. A way to avoid this problem is \n\nthe use of molecular techniques for the analysis of the microbial communities that take part in in \n\nsitu hydrocarbon biodegradation.  The most commonly used are the measurement of lipid \n\nbiomarkers, specifically, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), together with nucleic acid-based \n\nmolecular techniques for fingerprinting the 16S rRNA component of microbial cells, such as DGGE \n\n[52, 53].  \n\n1.4 Surfactants  \n\nSurfactants are a diverse group of compounds that are economically important due to \n\ntheir tensioactive properties. They are mainly known for being the most common ingredient of \n\ndetergent formulations and their primary function is to modify the interface between two or \n\nmore phases in order to promote the dispersion of one phase into another. Surfactants are able \n\nto concentrate at interfaces due to their amphiphilic character, resulting from the combination of \n\nhydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties within the same molecule [54, 55]. Surfactants are \n\ngenerally characterized by properties such as the critical micelle concentration (CMC), chemical \n\nstructure, charge, and in the case of biosurfactants, also by their source organism and the \n\nhydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) [54]. \n\nThe most common classification of chemical surfactants is according to the charge of their \n\nhydrophilic component: nonionic if the hydrophilic component is not ionized, anionic if the \n\nhydrophilic component comprises a negatively charged group, cationic if the hydrophilic \n\ncomponent comprises a positively charged group, and amphoteric if the hydrophilic group \n\ncontains both anionic and cationic characters [55].  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n\n18 \n \n \n \n \n\nA property of surfactants is their ability to form aggregate structures [54]. This \n\ncharacteristic is dependent on the concentration of the surface-active compounds until the CMC \n\nis obtained and will influence the surfactant activity [56].  Above the CMC the surfactant \n\nmolecules aggregate to form micelles, bilayers and vesicles which lead to the reduction of the \n\nsurface and interfacial tension and increase the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic \n\norganic compounds by partitioning the hydrophobic substrates and allowing closer cell-substrate \n\ninteractions [57]. The aggregates may also fuse directly with microbial membranes resulting in \n\ndirect substrate delivery [58]. However it is also possible that changes to the hydrophobicity of \n\nthe cell surface my increase repulsion, [59], or the formation of micelles encapsulating the \n\nsubstrate may decrease bioavailability resulting in either reduction in toxicity or decreased \n\nbioavailability [60]. Therefore, the CMC of a surfactant is a commonly used characteristic to \n\nmeasure its efficiency [56]. Surfactants with lower CMC values are considered to be more efficient \n\nsince less surfactant is needed to decrease the surface tension (Figure 4)[61].  \n\nMicelle formation also has a significant role in microemulsion formation [62]. This is \n\nparticularly important in oil bioremediation strategies since microemulsions are clear and stable \n\nliquid mixtures of water and oil phases separated by monolayer or aggregates of surfactants, \n\nwhich are formed when one liquid phase is dispersed as droplets in another liquid phase, for \n\nexample oil dispersed in water [61]. \n\nThe HLB is another property of surfactants used to assess their effectiveness. This \n\nparameter is used to judge if a surfactant is related to oil-in-water or to water-in-oil emulsions, \n\nand specifies the portion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic constituents in surface-active substances \n\nP\nh\n\ny\nsi\n\nca\nl \n\np\nro\n\np\ne\n\nrt\ny\n\n \n\nCMC \n\nSolubility \n\nSurface tension \n\nInterfacial tension \n\nSurfactant concentration \n\nP\nh\n\ny\nsi\n\nca\nl \n\np\nro\n\np\ne\n\nrt\ny\n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Changes in surface tension, interfacial tension and solubility depending on surfactant concentration \n[68].  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n  Introduction \n\n19 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n[56]. The HLB value also gives indication of the suitable applicability of a surfactant, making it \n\nuseful information when planning bioremediation strategies. Surfactants with low HLB are \n\nlipophilic and stabilize water-in-oil emulsification, whereas surfactants with high HLB are \n\nhydrophilic and confer better water solubility [61, 63]. \n\n1.4.1 Bacterial biosurfactants \n\nThere are several microorganisms that are able to synthesise a wide range of surface-\n\nactive compounds, generally called biosurfactants. Therefore, biosurfactants are molecules that \n\npossess the same characteristics of chemical surfactants but are produced by microorganisms. \n\nThese compounds are mainly classified according to their molecular weight, physico-chemical \n\nproperties and mode of action [56]. The low-molecular-weight biosurfactants (e.g. lipopeptides, \n\nglycolipids and proteins) reduce the surface tension at the air-water interfaces and the interfacial \n\ntension at oil-water interfaces, whereas the high-molecular-weight biosurfactants, also called \n\nbioemulsifiers (e.g. polymers of polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides proteins and lipoproteins) \n\nare more effective in establishing oil-in-water emulsions [64]. \n\nThe best studied biosurfactants are the glycolipids, which include the rhamnolipids (Figure \n\n5), the trehalolipids, sophorolipids and mannosylerythriol lipids. These compounds contain mono- \n\nor disaccharides, combined with long-chain aliphatic acids or hydroxyaliphatic acids. It is also \n\nimportant to refer that the major producers of rhamnolipids belong to the Pseudomonas genus \n\n[64].  \n\nIn microorganisms, biosurfactants are naturally involved in microbial competitive \n\ninteraction, cell-to-cell communications, plant and animal pathogenesis, increasing of \n\nbioavailability of surface-bound subtracts and heavy \n\nmetals (via direct interfacial contact and \n\npseudosolubilization), avoidance of toxic elements and \n\ncompounds,  motility and biofilm formation and \n\nmaintenance [54, 64]. Usually they are secondary \n\nmetabolites, produced at the end of the log phase \n\nand/or stationary phase. \n\nWhen compared with synthetic surfactants, \n\nbiosurfactants have several advantages, such as, higher \n\nrates of biodegradability, lower toxicity, better \n\nfoaming properties and better stability at extreme pH, \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Chemical structure of a \nrhamnolipids [132]. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n\n20 \n \n \n \n \n\nsalinity and temperature values [65-67]. However, despite all these environmentally favourable \n\ncharacteristics, their commercialisation has not yet been fully achieved, since its production costs \n\ncannot compete with those of the chemical surfactants [64]. \n\n1.4.2 Biosurfactants and oil bioremediation \n\nA possible application of biosurfactants is in the remediation of environmental \n\ncontamination with organic compounds, such as hydrophobic hydrocarbons. In this case, due to \n\nthe fact that the contaminant is hydrophobic, there is relatively little area of contact between the \n\nwater phase and the oil phase. In these circumstances the addition of biosurfactants aims to \n\nincrease the bioavailability of the hydrocarbons (biosurfactant-enhanced bioremediation) or the \n\nmobilisation and removal the contaminants by pseudosolubilization and emulsification in a \n\nwashing treatment [35, 64]. Biosurfactant addition to contaminated sites may also increase \n\nsubstrate bioavailability by increasing the hydrophobicity of the surface of the cell allowing \n\nhydrophobic substrates to associate more easily with bacterial cells [68]. As mentioned before, \n\nthe production of biosurfactants can be activated as a response of the microorganisms to the \n\nneed to use water insoluble substrates. In these cases biosurfactant production is necessary for \n\nspecific adhesion mechanisms to large oil drops or for the emulsification of oil, followed by the \n\nuptake of submicron oil droplets [69, 70]. These mechanisms are present in many oil-utilising \n\nmicroorganisms, which produce cell wall associated or extracellular surface-active agents, to \n\nfacilitate the hydrocarbon uptake through the hydrophilic outer membrane [71]. Such agents are \n\nmainly low molecular weight compounds, such as fatty acids, triacylglycerols and \n\nphospholipids.[3, 72] Cultures of these bacteria become brown and turbid as the oil slick is \n\ntransformed into many small oil droplets. Bacterial cells are associated on the surface of the \n\ndroplets, and such contact may facilitate the assimilation of petroleum components into the cells \n\n[35]. \n\nSeveral studies and field trials have proved that the introduction of external surfactants in \n\ncontaminated environments will influence the degradation rate of oil components [3]. However, \n\nwhile in some cases the effect is stimulatory [73-76], in others it has proven to be inhibitory or \n\nneutral [77, 78]. This, added to the fact that chemical dispersants have caused further ecological \n\ndamage to the ecosystems after application for removal of spilled oil, makes the use of \n\nbiosurfactants, which are less toxic and partially biodegradable, preferable to use in \n\nbioremediation strategies [23, 79]. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n  Introduction \n\n21 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n1.5 Environmental matrixes as a seedbank for surfactant-\n\nproducing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria \n\n1.5.1 The sea surface microlayer  \n\n The sea surface microlayer (SML) represents the interface between the ocean and the \n\natmosphere, where the transfer of material is controlled by complex physicochemical processes. \n\nIt is considered as the uppermost 1st mm of the water column, and presents distinct \n\nphysicochemical properties compared with subsurface water. This interface can serve as a sink of \n\nanthropogenic compounds, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, due to its unique chemical \n\ncomposition, enriched in biogenic organic molecules, such as lipids, proteins and polysaccharides \n\n[80]. Because of the particular features of the SML, such as the presence of the surface film and \n\nthe high surface tension, it is considered to be a unique habitat and the living communities that \n\ndevelop in this compartment of the water column are referred to as the neuston. Bacterial \n\ncommunities that are present in the surface microlayer are known as the bacterioneuston. These \n\nmicroorganisms are subjected to both favorable (e.g. high concentrations of organic and inorganic \n\nnutrients) and detrimental factors (e.g. intense UV radiation, high concentrations of heavy metals \n\nand organic pollutants, temperature and salinity fluctuations). As a result, the SML is considered \n\nto be an extreme environment for microorganisms, which explains the occurrence of unusual \n\nspecies and taxa. Some of the bacterial strains isolated from SML are Proteobacteria and \n\nActinobacteria, and include genera such as Pseudomonas, Chromobacterium, Aeromonas and \n\nMicrococcus [81, 82].  \n\n In areas associated with anthropogenic coastal activities, particularly shipping harbors, it \n\nis common to find high levels of PAHs in SML water. Results of several studies lead to believe that \n\nthe amount of PAHs in the SML in these sites is related to the size of the port and intensity of \n\nshipping traffic [83]. The main causes are related to the discharge of waste water form shipping \n\n(proximity of the contamination source) combined with limited water exchange in the harbor \n\n(restricted hydrodynamics) [84-86]. However, atmospheric deposition of combustion residues and \n\nbiogenic sources may also lead to the enrichment of PAHs in the SML [83]. \n\n1.5.2 Rhizosphere environments \n\nPlant roots are known to have important effects on the structural diversity of bacterial \n\ncommunities inhabiting soil and sediment closely attached the roots (rhizosphere effect).[87]. The \n\nmicroorganisms present in rhizosphere communities may have negative, positive or neutral \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n\n22 \n \n \n \n \n\neffects on the plant, influencing its growth and health [88]. The accumulation of microorganisms \n\nin the rhizosphere is supported by root exudates which make the surrounding soil rich in sugars, \n\namino acids, hormones, sugar alcohols, organic acids, vitamins, terpenoids, coumarins and \n\nflavonoids [89]. However these secretions may also lead to a decrease of certain microbes [87].  \n\nOn the other hand the microbial community present in the rhizosphere deeply influences the \n\nplant by decomposition, affecting nutrient uptake, antagonistic effects in other microorganism \n\nand parasitism [88].  \n\nMicroorganisms in the rhizosphere are mostly found in biofilms rather than in the \n\nplanktonic state [90]. However, bacterial interactions, growth and formation of biofilms on the \n\nroot and sediment surfaces have been shown to involve complex mechanisms [91] and in some \n\ncases it is connected to biosurfactant production [92, 93].  In the rhizosphere, biosurfactant \n\nproduction has also been associated with swarming motility, zoosporicidal and antifungical \n\nactivities [93-95] . \n\n1.5.3 Bulk sediments environments \n\nSoil not directly influenced by root activity is referred as bulk sediment or soil [87]. Most \n\nof the microbial communities present in bulk sediments are also found in rhizosphere. However, \n\nsince in most cases there are less nutrients available in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere, \n\ncommonly bulk sediment communities have lower diversity and quantity of microorganisms [87, \n\n96]. Estuarine sediments in particular, are known sinks of contaminants [97], with petroleum \n\nhydrocarbons being the most common contaminants [98].  \n\nMicroorganisms in sediments are fundamental to diagenesis of organic matter. An \n\nimportant ability involved in such processes is their capacity to form biofilms, on thesurface of \n\nsediment particle [99]. As in rhizosphere, the formation of biofilms by bulk sediment bacteria is \n\nassociated with the production of biosurfactants [100, 101]. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n \n  Introduction \n\n23 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n1.6 Goals and strategy \n\nBioremediation has proven to be an environmental friendly and economically feasible \n\nstrategy for recuperation of oil contaminated ecosystems. However the application of this \n\ntechnique is often limited by the hydrophobicity of the contaminants, making them hard to be \n\nmetabolized by the bacteria used. Hence, a possible solution for this problem would be the use of \n\nhydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producing bacteria, since the presence of surfactants help \n\nimprove the hydrocarbons dispersal, solubilization and bioavailability.  \n\nThus, the main goal of this study was to assess the biotechnological potential of \n\nhydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producing bacteria isolated from the estuarine system of Ria \n\nde Aveiro (Portugal). Selective cultures of hydrophobic hydrocarbons were prepared to stimulate \n\nthe growth of potential hydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producing isolates, using three \n\ndifferent carbon sources (Arabian light crude oil, maritime diesel and liquid paraffin) and three \n\ndifferent environmental matrixes (SML water, bulk sediment and rhizosphere) from Ria de Aveiro. \n\nThe communities established in the different selective cultures were characterized in terms of the \n\nconcentration of CFU and compared in terms of structural diversity by analysis of 16S rRNA DGGE \n\nprofiles. A set of isolates was retrieved, typed by BOX-PCR and tested for biosurfactants \n\nproduction by the atomized oil assay.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

Material and Methods \n\n2.1 Characterization of the study area and sampling site \n\nRia de Aveiro is a shallow estuary-coastal \n\nlagoon system, located in north Portugal at \n\napproximately 40.7\u00b0 N, 8.7\u00b0 W. The physical system \n\nis characterized by many branching channels that are \n\nconnected to the Atlantic Ocean by a single tidal \n\nchannel [102].  \n\nAll samples were collected on the 25\nth\n\n \n\nOctober 2010 at a  sampling site (40\u00b037\u201932.0952\u201d N, \n\n8\u00b044\u20199.2832\u201d W) located at the east margin of Mira \n\nchannel, one of the main branches of the estuarine \n\nsystem of Ria de Aveiro (Figure 6). The Barra salt \n\nmarsh encompasses approximately 2.2 hectares of \n\nvegetated area [103] and is located in the proximity \n\nof the commercial port of Aveiro, and several smaller \n\nharbors used by leisure and fishing ships. Analysis of \n\nsediment samples (superficial horizon 0-5 cm) of this \n\nsite have shown that it is mainly constituted by clay \n\nand has a mean value of organic matter of 9 % [104]. \n\nThe most common salt-marsh vegetation species \n\nfound at this site are Halimione portulacoides (L.) \n\nAellen, Sarcocornia perennis (Miller) A.J. Scott subsp. \n\nperennis, Salicornia ramosissima J. Woods, Juncus \n\nmaritimus Lam. and Limonium vulgare Miller [105]. \n\nThe rhizosphere of H. portulacoides harbors a dense \n\nbacterial community, because this particular micro-\n\nhabitat is thought to favorably meet bacterial \n\nrequirements in terms of the availability of labile \n\norganic compounds [106]. Colonized sediments of the \n\nRia de Aveiro are richer in fine particles and in inorganic nutrients, namely nitrogen and \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Ria de Aveiro (Portugal).

For \n\ncollection of the SML, the plate was slowly submerged in an upright position, slowly removed in \n\nthe same position (Figure 7-A). After allowing the plate to drip for 5 seconds, the water adhering \n\nto both surfaces was removed by forcing the plate between two Teflon wiper blades and \n\ncollecting the water in sterilized glass bottles (Figure 7-B). This process was repeated several \n\ntimes until approximately 50 mL of SML water was collected. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Sediment \n\n The sediment sample was obtained by scraping the upper 3 cm of unvegetated sediments \n\nat the lower limit of the intertidal area at the margin of Mira Channel with a sterilized spatula.

Intact plant specimens were collected and the excess sediment was \n\ngently removed in the field. The plants were transferred to sterilized plastic bags and brought to \n\nthe laboratory in isothermal boxes.  \n\n Oliveira et al. [108] determined that the sediment of Halimione portulacoides banks \n\npresent at 3-4 cm a water content of 22.2 % for the month of September. In the same study the \n\nsediment was classified as mud with the fraction of fine particles corresponding to 94.8 % of the \n\nsediment dry weight. \n\n2.3 Extraction of microbial cells from the environmental matrixes \n\nIn the laboratory, the roots of Halimione portulacoides specimens were carefully washed \n\nwith distilled water in order to remove the loosely attached sediment. After washing, the roots \n\nwere cut in 2-4 cm fragments with the aid of sterilized scissors and forceps. \n\nFor the extraction of microbial cells, sub-samples of 5 g of sediment or 5 g of root were \n\nplaced in Erlenmeyers with 45 mL of extraction solution (0,1 % Tween 80, Merck; and 0,1 % \n\nsodium pyrophosphate) and  5 g of glass beads (4 mm diameter). The suspensions were placed on \n\na shaker incubator (model SI4-2, Shel Lab, U.S.A.) for 5 min at 100 rpm. After the agitation, \n\nparticles were allowed to settle for 1 min. and the  supernatant was used as inoculum [109].  \n\nThe water of the SML did not suffer any process for extraction of microbial cells and was \n\ndirectly used as inoculum.   \n\n2.4 Culture media  \n\nMineral Salts Medium (MSM), was obtained from a Base Mineral Medium (BMM, [110]) \n\nconsisting of 1.0 g L\n-1\n\n NH4NO3, 0.7 g L\n-1\n\n KCl, 0.0005 g L\n-1\n\n FeCl3?6H2O, 2x10\n-5\n\n g L\n-1\n\n CaCl2, 5x10\n-6\n\n g L\n-1\n\n \n\nCuSO4, 5x10\n-6\n\n g L\n-1\n\n MnCl2?4H2O and 1x10\n-4\n\n g L\n-1\n\n ZnSO4?7H2O (Sigma), prepared with brackish water \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterial and Methods \n\n30 \n \n \n \n \n\n(17 g/L NaCl, AppliChem; pH 7.2 \u00b1 0.2) to which 2 % agarose (Gentaur)  was added and solubilized \n\nby heating to 100 \u00b0C for 5 min. The culture medium was then sterilized in the autoclave (20 min, \n\n121 \u00b0C). After sterilization, the medium was allowed to cool down to approximately 45-50 \u00b0C and \n\nthe thermo labile compounds were added as sterilized stock solutions in order to obtain de final \n\nconcentrations of 3.0 g L\n-1\n\n Na2HPO4 (Sigma), 7.0 g L\n-1\n\n MgSO4?7H2O and 2.0 g L\n-1\n\n KH2PO4 (Sigma); pH \n\n7.2 \u00b1 0.2, and 0.1 g L\n-1\n\n cicloheximide (VWR). All reagents were purchase from Merck except when \n\notherwise indicated. For liquid cultures, MSM was prepared without agarose. \n\n2.5 Carbon sources \n\nFor this work, three hydrocarbon-rich carbon sources were tested: liquid paraffin (Merck), \n\nlight Arabian crude oil and maritime diesel. Before being added to the mineral medium, the \n\ncarbon sources were sterilized. by the following methods: paraffin was autoclaved for 20 min at \n\n121 \u00b0C; a small volume of Arabian light crude oil was transferred to a petri dish in order to obtain \n\na thin layer that was exposed to UV radiation for 4 hours; maritime diesel was sterilized by \n\nvacuum filtration at 300 mmHg using PTFE membranes with \u00d8 0.2 \u00b5m pore size. \n\n2.6 Selective cultures with hydrocarbons  \n\nTo select for biosurfactant producing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, hydrophobic carbon \n\nsources were used in the selective cultures using the different environmental inocula (Table 3). \n\nThe cultures were prepared in sterile erlenmeyers by adding 1 mL (1 %) of the sterilized carbon \n\nsource and 5 mL (5 %) inoculum (SML water or sediment/rhizosphere cell suspensions) to 94 mL \n\nof liquid MSM. The nine cultures were incubated in an orbital incubator at 26 \u00b0C and 130 rpm for \n\n2 months. At the end of the incubation, sub-samples of each culture were transferred to 50 mL \n\nFalcon tubes and preserved at -16 \u00b0C for DNA extraction and metagenomic analysis. \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Designation of the several selective cultures in relation to the inoculums environmental matrixes \nand the hydrophobic carbon sources \n\n \n\n  Hydrophobic carbon sources \n\nIn\no\n\ncu\nlu\n\nm\n  Arabian light crude oil Maritime diesel Liquid paraffin \n\nSML water CA DA PA \n\nBulk sediment CS DS PS \n\nRhizosphere sediment CR DR PR \n\n\n\n \n \n   \n \n  Material and Methods \n  \n\n31 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n2.7 Colony forming units (CFUs) \n\nStarting from the third week, the concentration of viable bacteria was assessed by the \n\nnumber of CFUs in non selective medium. Weekly, 100 \u00b5L of each culture were serially diluted in \n\nRinger solution and aliquots of 100 \u00b5L of the appropriate dilution range were spread plated in \n\ntriplicate in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) plates (Merck; 15 g/L casein peptone, 5 g/L soy peptone, 5 g/L \n\nNaCl, 15 g/L agar; pH 7.3\u00b10.2) containing 0.1 g/L cicloheximide (VWR) to restrain the growth of \n\nfungi. The cultures were incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 2 days, after which the colonies were counted and \n\nthe concentration of CFUs was estimated from the average counts in the most suitable dilution \n\nand corrected for the dilution factor.   \n\nStatistical tests were performed using SPSS v15.0. Differences between the CFUs mL\n-1\n\n \n\nresults obtained between the various carbon sources and matrixes through time were analyzed by \n\ntwo-way repeated measures ANOVA. Sphericity of the data was evaluated by the Mauchly's \n\nsphericity test. If the data met this criteria (p?0.05) it was directly subjected to parametric \n\nanalysis of variances with Bonferroni adjustments, if not (p?0.05) Greenhouse-Geisser correction \n\nwas used.  \n\n2.8 Isolation and purification of bacterial strains \n\nEvery week, during the 2 months incubation period of the selective cultures, 3 replicates \n\nof 100 \u00b5L of each culture were serially diluted in Ringer solution and spread-plated on solid MSM \n\non which 50 \u00b5L of the corresponding carbon source had been previously spread. The plates were \n\nincubated at 25 \u00b0C for 2 weeks. From the plates of the most convenient dilutions of each \n\ncombination of carbon source and environmental matrix, isolated colonies were selected based \n\non morphology and color. For further isolation and purification, the selected colonies were streak \n\nplated in solid MSM amended with the corresponding carbon source. The plates were then \n\nincubated at room temperature (approx. 25 \u00b0C) for a week and the purification by streak platting \n\nwas repeated 3 times. Isolates were then inoculated with a sterile loop in liquid MSM medium \n\nwith 1 % of the respective carbon source. When the purity of the isolates was confirmed by \n\noptical microscopy after gram staining, the cultures were frozen with glycerol (15 %; AppliChem) \n\nand kept at 4 \u00b0C until processing. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterial and Methods \n\n32 \n \n \n \n \n\n2.9 Denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) \n\n2.9.1 DNA extraction of selective cultures \n\nTotal DNA was extracted from the 2-month selective cultures according to the protocol \n\ndescribed by Costa et al. [111]. A total volume of 10 mL of each of the selective was centrifuged at \n\n13,300 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was ressuspended in 500 \u00b5L of ethanol 96 %, mixed in the vortex \n\nand then transferred to Fast Prep tubes containing a mixture of beads with different diameters. \n\nThe bead mixture was composed by 0.1 g of each kind of the following beads:  0.75-1.0 mm, 0.1 \n\nmm, 0.25-0.5 mm and 2.85-3.45 mm glassbeads; and 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads. Previous to \n\ntheir use the glass beads were washed in the Fast Prep tubes. This consisted in covering the beads \n\nin the tubes with HCl solution (5.8 mM), mixing it well and incubating at room temperature for 1 \n\nhour, with occasional agitation. The HCl solution was then removed with a micropipette and \n\nsterile dH2O was added to cover the beads. The beads were washed by agitating the tube for 30 s \n\nand dH2O was removed. The washing procedure was repeated 4 times. Finally the tubes were \n\nslightly opened and placed in an incubator at 65 \u00b0C overnight to dry. For the extraction, the tubes \n\ncontaining the bead mixture and the samples were agitated for 2 consecutive periods of 30 \n\nseconds in the FastPrep FP120 bead beating system (Qbiogene, USA) at 5.5 m/s. \n\nThe suspensions were then transferred to new microtubes and centrifuged at 13,300 rpm \n\nfor 5 min. The supernatants were discarded and 1.2 mL of extraction buffer (100 mM sodium \n\nphosphate [pH 7.0], 100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0], 100 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 1.5 M NaCl, 1 % CTAB and \n\n2 % SDS [112]) was added to the pellet. The mixture was gently homogenized then incubated at \n\n65 \u00b0C for 30 min. After a new centrifugation at 13,300 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants were \n\ntransferred to new tubes containing 1 mL of 21:1 chloroform-isoamyl alcohol solution. The tubes \n\nwere carefully mixed and then centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 5 min. The resulting aqueous phase \n\nwas then transferred to a new microtube containing 0.6 % isopropanol (vol/vol) and incubated for \n\n30 min at room temperature. After a final centrifugation at 13,300 rpm for 5 min, the resulting \n\npellet of nucleic acids was washed twice with 0.5 mL 70 % cold ethanol and then air dried. The \n\npellet was resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of TE buffer (10 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 1mM EDTA.Na2, pH \n\n8) and stored at - 20 \u00b0C.

The PCR \n\ncycle was composed by 5 min of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, 25 thermal cycles of 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 45 s at \n\n56 \u00b0C, and 1.5\n \nmin at 72 \u00b0C, and a final extension step\n\n \nat 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. \n\nThe PCR products were then submitted to nested PCR. The Bacteria domain specific \n\nprimers used in the second PCR  are 968F -GC (5\u00b4-CGC CCG GGG CGC GCC CCG GGC GGG GCG GGG \n\nGCA CGG GGG GAA CGC GAA GAA CCT TAC-3\u00b4) and 1401R (5\u00b4-CGG TGT GTA CAA GAC CC-3\u00b4) [114] \n\nsynthesized by IBA (IBA GmbH, Germany). The reaction mixtures had a total of 25 \u00b5L and were \n\nmade of 0.5 \u00b5L sample, 12.5 \u00b5L DreamTaq\u2122 PCR Master Mix (Fermentas), 0.5 \u00b5L of each primer, \n\n2.0 \u00b5L acetamide (Fluka) and 9.0 \u00b5L dH2O. For the second PCR reaction, the denaturation step \n\ntook 4 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 30 thermal cycles of 1 min at 95 \u00b0C, 1 min at 53 \u00b0C, and 2 min at \n\n72 \u00b0C, and finally an extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. PCR reactions were conducted in a \n\nMultiGene Gradient Thermal Cycler (MIDSCI). \n\nThe success of the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene fragments was verified by agarose \n\n(Gentaur) gel (1.8 %) electrophoresis, with 5.3x10\n-6\n\n % (vol/vol) GelRed (Biotium) as DNA staining \n\nagent, at 80 V for 30 min in 1x TAE buffer (0.04 M Tris-Acetate, 0.001 M EDTA; Fluka; pH 8.0). The \n\npresence of bands was visualized in a UV transiluminator (Benchtop UV). \n\n2.9.3 DGGE run and analysis \n\nDGGE was performed with the DCode System (C.B.S. Scientific). PCR products containing \n\napproximately equal amounts of DNA were loaded onto 6-9 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 1xTAE \n\nbuffer (0.04 M Tris-Acetate, 0.001 M EDTA; Fluka; pH 8.0). The 6-9 % polyacrilamide gel \n\n(bisacrylamide:acrylamide = 37.5:1) was made with a denaturing gradient ranging from 32 to      \n\n60 %. Electrophoresis was performed for 16 h at 150 V at 60 \u00b0C in 1 x TAE buffer. Following \n\nelectrophoresis, the gels were silver-stained [115]. Briefly, gels were fixed with 0.1 % (v/v) ethanol \n\nplus 0.005 % acetic acid (Merck), stained with 0.3 g AgNO3 (Merck) and developed with 0.003 % \n\n(v/v) formaldehyde (Merck) and 0.33 % Na OH (9 %)(Merck). A 0.75 % Na2CO3 (Fluka) solution was \n\nused to stop the development. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterial and Methods \n\n34 \n \n \n \n \n\nThe bands with higher intensity or that were present in several lanes of different samples \n\nwere cut from the gel and stored in microtubes at -20 \u00b0C for later cloning and identification. \n\nThe profiles obtained were analyzed with GelCompar 4.0 software (Applied Maths, \n\nBelgium). The bands occupying the same position in the different lanes of the gels were identified. \n\nA binary (1/0) matrix was constructed taking into account the presence or absence of individual \n\nbands in each lane. Cluster analysis was performed using PRIMER v5 software (Primer-e, UK). The \n\nbinary matrix was transformed into a similarity matrix (dendrogram) using the Bray Curtis \n\nmeasure. In order to compare the diversity between the different selective cultures, the \n\nShannon\u2013Weaver diversity index (H) was calculated as follows: H=??(pi) (log2pi), where i \n\nrepresents all the unique bands and pi is the relative abundance of band i [116] using software \n\nPRIMER v5.  \n\n2.10 Molecular typing of the isolates by BOX-PCR \n\n2.10.1 DNA extraction of bacterial isolates \n\nAliquots of  glycerol-amended frozen cultures were used to inoculate 1 mL of TSB (Merck) \n\nin a microtube, which was incubated overnight at 26 \u00b0C in an orbital shaker (model SI4-2, Shel \n\nLab), at 120 rpm. The procedure for DNA extraction was based in the protocol described by \n\nHenriques et al. [117]. 500 \u00b5L of culture was transferred to new microtubes and centrifuged at \n\n13,300 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of TE \n\nbuffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6-8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) and 50 \u00b5L of 30 g L\n-1\n\n lysozyme solution (Roche).  \n\nAfter incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 40 min, 50 \u00b5L of lyse solution (Genomic DNA Purification Kit, \n\nFermentas) was added. The mixture was incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min and after this period 20 \u00b5L \n\nof SDS 25 % was added. The mixture was further incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min more after which \n\n50 \u00b5L of 5 M NaCl was added. The mixture was agitated in the vortex at maximum speed for one \n\nminute and 200 \u00b5L of chloroform was added. The mixture was homogenized by repeated \n\ninversion of the tubes and then centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 5 min. The aqueous phase was then \n\ncarefully pipetted to new microtubes in which 100 \u00b5L of isopropyl alcohol was added and then \n\nmixed by inversion. Finally the mixture was centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 5 min and 100 \u00b5L of \n\ncold ethanol 96 % was added and mixed by inversion. After an incubation of 15 min at 4 \u00b0C the \n\nmixture was again centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the \n\nDNA-RNA pellet was washed with 100 \u00b5L of ethanol 70 %.  The reaction mixture was allowed to \n\nsettle for 1 min and again centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and \n\n\n\n \n \n   \n \n  Material and Methods \n  \n\n35 \n \n \n \n\n \n\nthe microtubes were open so that the pellet could dry at room temperature. Finally the DNA-RNA \n\npellet was resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of TE buffer and the microtubes were kept at -20 \u00b0C. All \n\ncentrifugations were performed on a Heraeus Pico 17 centrifuge (Thermo Scientific). \n\n2.10.2 BOX-PCR procedures and analysis \n\nBOX-PCR was conducted in order to identify isolates with similar genotypes and to group \n\nthem in clones according to their similarity in order to spot suitable representatives for \n\nidentification, thus reducing the DNA sequencing effort. The PCR mix used was composed of  \n\n13.25 \u00b5L dH2O, 2.5 \u00b5L KCl buffer 10x, 2.5 \u00b5L dUTPs, 3.75 \u00b5L MgCl2, 1,25 \u00b5L DMSO, 0.25 \u00b5L Taq \n\npolymerase, 0.5 \u00b5L primer  BOX A1R (5\u2019-CTA CGG CAA GGC GAC GCT GAC G-3\u2019) and 1.00 \u00b5L \n\ntemplate for 25.00 \u00b5L of reaction (all reagents from Fermentas). The cycling conditions used \n\nincluded a denaturation step of 7 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 35 thermal cycles of 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 2 \n\nmin at 53 \u00b0C, and 8 min at 65 \u00b0C, and finally an extension step at 65 \u00b0C for 16 min. PCR was \n\nconducted in a MyCycler Thermal Cycler (BioRad). The PCR products were stored at -20 \u00b0C. \n\nThe PCR products were then run in agarose (Gentaur) gel (1.5 %) electrophoresis, with \n\n5.3x10\n-6\n\n % (vol/vol) GelRed (Biotium), at 80 V for 3h in TAE buffer 1x (5Prime). The profiles were \n\nvisualized in a UV transiluminator (Benchtop UV) and were photographed using a Canon \n\nPowershot G10. The profiles obtained were analyzed with GelCompar 4.0 software (Applied \n\nMaths, Belgium). A dendrogram relating all isolates was generated by clustering correlation using \n\nthe UPGMA method with fine alignment. \n\n2.11 Analysis of biosurfactant production  \n\nThe isolates were tested as to their capacity to produce biosurfactants by the atomized oil \n\nassay [118]. This technique has proven to be more sensitive to lower amounts of biosurfactants \n\nthan the commonly used drop-collapse method [118], and has also the advantage of allowing a \n\nquick screening of a high number of isolates. \n\nThe isolates used were initially in liquid selective cultures (MSM with 1 % of the respective \n\ncarbon source). Not all isolates grown in liquid selective cultures were considered to be pure by \n\ngram staining, and therefore due to time limiting factors and so that a more comprehensive \n\nanalysis of the production of biosurfactants was conducted, the isolates that were grown in non-\n\nselective TSB for the BOX-PCR analysis were also tested.  As such some isolates were tested twice, \n\nfrom the rich medium and from the selective culture, so that a preliminary study of the \n\npreference for rich or selective media for the production of biosurfactants by the bacteria could \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterial and Methods \n\n36 \n \n \n \n \n\nbe conducted. However for the calculus of the biosurfactant producers percentage all replicas of \n\nan isolate were counted as one. With the aid of a sterilized toothpick, the isolates were spotted \n\non plates of Luria Bertani (LB) agar (10 g/L tryptone, Merck, 5 g/L yeast extract, Merck, 10 g/L \n\nNaCl, AppliChem, and 15 g/L agar, Liofilchem; pH 7.0 \u00b1 0.2) and incubated overnight at 28 \u00b0C. \n\nEscherichia coli DH5? was used as a negative control [118] and solutions of commercial \n\nsurfactants were used as positive controls:  0.008 mM Tween 80 (Merck), 10 mM SDS (BioRad), \n\nand 1.19 g L\n-1\n\n surfactin (Sigma). Aliquots of 2 \u00b5L of each surfactant solution were spotted on the \n\nsurface of the LB agar plates. The analysis was performed by using an airbrush (model BD-128P, \n\nFengda, China) to nebulize liquid paraffin (Merck) at a constant range over the inoculated LB agar \n\nplates. The presence of biosurfactants was detected by the immediate appearance of a halo \n\nsurrounding the colony, visualized under indirect bright light. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n   \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

Results \n\n3.1 Selective cultures with hydrophobic substrates \n\nNine different selective cultures were prepared with varying carbon sources and inocula. \n\nThe original appearance of the liquid cultures was of an aqueous phase in the bottom and a very \n\nthin organic phase consisting of the hydrophobic substrate added as carbon source at the surface. \n\nDuring the course of the incubation, the organic phase became less distinct and the aqueous \n\nphase became turbid, especially in the crude and paraffin cultures (Figure 8). \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Selective cultures using hydrocarbon\u2013rich substrates as hydrophobic carbon sources, (A) \nmaritime diesel, (B) Arabian light crude oil, and (C) liquid paraffin, were used for isolation of biosurfactants \nproducing bacteria inhabiting SML water (a), bulk sediment (s) and rhizosphere (r), after 2 months of \n\nincubation at 130 rpm at 26\u00b0C.  \n\n \n\n \n\na \n\na \n\na \n\nr \n\nr \n\nr \n\ns \n\ns \n\ns \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults \n\n40 \n \n \n  \n \n\n3.2 Bacterial abundance of selective cultures  \n\nThe variation of the concentration of CFU/mL in the selective cultures from week 3 until \n\nthe end of the incubation are represented in Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11. \n\nThe selective culture with highest overall concentration of CFUs throughout the \n\nincubation period was the CS culture (average of 2,77x10\n8\n CFU mL\n\n-1\n), and the lowest was found in \n\nthe DR culture (average of 1,73x10\n7\n CFU mL\n\n-1\n). Through statistical tests (two-way repeated \n\nmeasures ANOVA) all crude, diesel and paraffin cultures with different matrixes were shown to be \n\nsignificantly different between themselves (p<0.05) except between CA and CR and PS and PR \n\n(p>0.05).   In the crude cultures (Figure 9) the number of CFUs showed a tendency to decline over \n\ntime, while in the diesel cultures (Figure 10) a relatively constant level of CFUs was maintained in \n\nthe last 4 weeks, and in the paraffin selective cultures (Figure 11), with the exception of PS, a \n\nslight tendency of the CFUs values to increase was observed in the last weeks.  \n\nAll rhizosphere cultures (Figures 9, 10 and 11) have the lowest CFUs values, although in a \n\nrelatively steady level throughout the incubation period. Statistical tests have shown that there is \n\nno significative difference between CR and PR regarding bacterial abundance (p >0.05). Bulk \n\nsediment and SML water selective cultures present similar levels of CFUs except for the cultures \n\nwith crude as carbon source in which the sediment culture had significantly higher CFU \n\nconcentration. Statistical tests have found all sediment cultures to be significativily different \n\namong themselves regarding bacterial abundance (p<0.05), as well as the SML water cultures \n\nexcept between PA and DA (p >0.05). Bulk sediment selective cultures and SML water showed \n\nhigh CFU concentration in the first weeks and a steep decrease, followed by a relative stabilization \n\nin the later weeks of the incubation period, except for the PS and CA cultures. Post hoc tests \n\nconfirmed this results showing that at the third week bulk sediment cultures presented \n\nsignificativily higher bacterial abundance than at the fifth week (p<0.05).

From the remaining that \n\nwere found to be contaminated or extremely slow-growing in selective media, an additional set of \n\n34 isolates could be retrieved from the non-selective TSB cultures used for the BOX-PCR analysis. \n\nFinally a set of 66 isolates was achieved.

The isolate 36 was used a positive control through different \n\nelectrophoresis gels. Since the similarity of the controls (isolate 36) is 90 % at the minimum, a \n\ncutoff of approximately 90 % was assumed as the threshold for identical strains. Five clusters of \n\nisolates with more than 90 % similarity (approx.) were identified. \n\n3.6 Screening of the isolates for biosurfactant production \n\nFrom the 111 isolates acquired through isolation and purification in MSM solid medium \n\nonly the remaining 32 pure isolates in liquid selective medium and the 66 isolates in TSB used in \n\nBOX, were tested for the production of biosurfactants. Of these two groups there is an \n\nintersection of 32 isolates and in total 66 different isolates were tested.    \n\nOf the 66 overall isolates tested with the atomized oil assay 17 were positive (25.8 %) for \n\nthe production of biosurfactants. Since the aim of this test is to identify biosurfactant producers, \n\nthe isolates that produced biosurfactants in one medium but not in the other were counted in the \n\noverall percentage as biosurfactant producers, that is, as a positive result. Those that presented \n\njust negative or positive results in both media were counted just once. From the total of 66 \n\ndifferent isolates tested, 4 positive results came from both media, 5 from the TSA medium and 11 \n\nfrom the MSM subset.  \n\nSelective \ncultures \n\nPA CS PR CA DS PS CR DA DR \n\nShannon-\nWeaver Index \n\n2,913\n4 \n\n2,600\n6 \n\n2,493\n3 \n\n2,446\n8 \n\n2,239\n2 \n\n2,162\n6 \n\n1,705\n3 \n\n1,502\n9 \n\n1,275\n9 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults \n\n46 \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n\nSimilarity (%) \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Dendrogram of the results from the electrophoresis of the BOX-PCR products.

Discussion \n\n4.1 Selective cultures with hydrocarbons as hydrophobic carbon \n\nsources \n\nHydrocarbons have shown good results when used as subtracts for the selection and \n\nisolation of biosurfactant producing microorganisms [119]. For this reason, petroleum \n\nhydrocarbons were chosen as substrates for the selective cultures, since the aim of this work was \n\nto isolate biosurfactant producing bacteria. Additionally petroleum hydrocarbons were also \n\nchosen, instead of other hydrophobic hydrocarbons, such as frying oils, so that these isolates \n\ncould also have high potential in hydrocarbon remediation strategies. \n\nAfter 2 months of incubation, the visual appearance of the selective cultures had changed \n\nfrom a biphasic suspension to a turbid culture medium without a clear separation between the \n\nhydrophobic and the hydrophilic phases. This was interpreted as a first indication of the presence \n\nof bioemulsifiers in the cultures, produced by the enriched bacterial populations, that reduced the \n\ninterfacial tension between the two immiscible liquids [55]. Similar effects have been found in \n\nother hydrocarbon selective cultures with biosurfactant producing strains [120-122]. The \n\nemulsification effect has been interpreted as an increase of bioavailability of petroleum \n\nhydrocarbons which would be favorable to bioremediation strategies at sea [35].  \n\nThe emulsification effect was particularly visible in the crude selective cultures and was \n\nvery clearly observed in the isolation cultures in solid media. The emulsification of the \n\nhydrophobic substrate, that in this case was crude, may have caused the halo effect that was \n\nobserved around isolated colonies. Also, some crude biodegradation may have occurred in the \n\nliquid selective cultures, as well as in the solid isolation cultures, because the hydrocarbon-rich \n\nsubstrate was provided as sole-carbon source selecting for hydrocarbonoclastic microbes.    \n\n4.2 Effect of the selective media on bacterial communities \n\n4.2.1 Culturability \n\nOne of the objectives of this work was to select for the most suitable medium for the \n\nisolation of biosurfactant producing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria from different environmental \n\nmatrices. For that, a mineral medium was amended with one of 3 distinct carbon sources that \n\nwere hydrophobic, selecting for biosurfactants producers, and rich in hydrocarbons, selecting for \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n\n52 \n \n \n \n \n\nmicrobes capable of using hydrocarbons as carbon sources. Fungi are a relevant component of \n\nthe hydrocarbon-degrading microflora in the environment and to restrain their growth, \n\ncycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms, was added to the \n\nselective cultures.  The colony counts (CFU) in non-selective media were used as an approach to \n\ndetermine the size of the community and not to the proportion of target organisms \n\n(hydrocarbonoclastic-biosurfactant producers) because the later may profit from the degradative \n\nactivity of a few specialists, establishing complex syntrophic relations between community \n\nmembers[123]. Also, hydrocarbons can be toxic to non-degrading microorganism and the \n\nvariation of the community size in the selective cultures ultimately reflects the balance between \n\ninhibitory and stimulatory effects of the different populations that compose each community \n\n[45]. The variation of the number of colony forming units from the third week to the end of the \n\nincubation, globally showed that the response of the culturable fraction depends on the origin of \n\nthe inoculum and also on the carbon source provided.   \n\nOn average, the sediment inoculum produced the highest CFU counts, and the maximum \n\nwas observed in the selective medium containing crude. In diesel cultures, there was a steep \n\ndecrease during the first 5 weeks and the counts remained low to the end of the incubation and in \n\nparaffin, counts were always low and stable. This may be related to the richness and diversity of \n\ncarbon sources found in crude versus the less complex composition of diesel [4]. The cultures in \n\nwhich bulk sediment was used as inoculum also showed the highest average value for Shannon-\n\nWeaver index calculated from the DGGE profiles. Sediment bacterial communities are generally \n\nconsidered as highly diverse both in terms of community structure and physiological potential, \n\nwith the capacity of using a wide range of carbon sources [124, 125].  \n\nAlthough rhizosphere microbial communities are usually considered to be more diverse \n\nthan the communities from unvegetated sediments [106], in this case, they were probably more \n\nadapted to the use of root-derived carbon sources and could not use crude as efficiently as the \n\nmore eclectic community from bulk sediments. The culturable fraction of the communities in the \n\nrhizosphere selective cultures was quite stable during the incubation period, with only a slight \n\ndecrease of colony counts in the crude selective culture, towards the end of the incubation period \n\nindicating that these communities was less responsive to the selective pressure than bulk \n\nsediment or SML bacterial communities.  \n\nThe SML micro-environment is considered to be enriched in hydrophobic substrates, \n\nnamely some pollutants such as hydrocarbons [126]. Additionally, biosurfactant production is \n\nconsidered a widespread adaptation of bacterioneuston to the interfacial conditions of this \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n   Discussion \n  \n\n53 \n \n \n \n\n \n\nparticular compartment of the water column [81]. After 3 weeks of incubation, the concentration \n\nof CFU in the cultures inoculated with SML water was still very high in the diesel and paraffin \n\nselective cultures. From the forth week on, there was a decrease in CFU in all the selective \n\ncultures using SML inocula but at the end of the incubation, the concentration of CFU was slightly \n\nhigher in the paraffin selective cultures, in relation to the cultures with other carbon sources. \n\nThe general trend was a decrease in CFU in all selective cultures during the course of the \n\nincubation, which may be interpreted as a toxic effect or as a depletion of nutrients because of \n\ninsufficient hydrocarbon utilization in relation to the carbon demand of the community. However, \n\nthe least stressing conditions as inferred from the higher CFU values at the end of the incubation \n\nwere obtained in paraffin medium for the SML and the rhizosphere inocula and in crude medium \n\nwith the bulk sediment inoculum. \n\n4.2.2 Structural diversity \n\nThe relative diversity of the bacterial communities developing in the different selective \n\ncultures at the end of the incubation was determined using the data obtained from the analysis of \n\nthe DGGE profiles. Because the imposition of a strong selective pressure, such as the availability \n\nof a sole carbon source, could shape different communities in a convergent direction, the \n\ndendrogram was analyzed to check the closest (structurally more similar) communities. With the \n\nexception of all the paraffin amended cultures the crude-selective cultures of SML water and \n\nrhizosphere bacteria (CR and CA), there was not an enhanced similarity between communities \n\nforced to use the same carbon source. On the other hand, bulk sediment cultures with different \n\ncarbon sources (DS and PS) were more similar between each other than with cultures initiated \n\nfrom different inocula but amended with the same carbon source. A similar effect occurred in the \n\nDR and PR cultures. The results show that paraffin has a stronger effect in the shaping of \n\nmicrobial communities and that this effect imposes on the initial community structure, in the \n\nsense that, different communities became more similar after selective incubation in paraffin \n\nmedium. This may indicate an active adaptation of the community to a simpler carbon source. On \n\nthe contrary, diesel and crude do not exert the same degree of control over the structure of \n\nsediment and rhizosphere bacterial communities. The SML community seems to be extremely \n\nresponsive to the carbon source with very low similarity between communities challenged with \n\ndifferent carbon sources (DA, PA and CA). Studies have shown that blooms of specialized bacteria \n\ntend to appear in contaminated areas of the SML [31], which could explain the low similarity \n\nbetween cultures of the SML with different carbon sources.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n\n54 \n \n \n \n \n\nThe estimated values for the Shannon-Weaver index indicate that the PA selective \n\ncultures were the more diverse and that DR was the least diverse. These results are in line with \n\nthe information extracted from the analysis of the dendrogram and confirm the high physiological \n\ndiversity of bacterioneuston and the susceptibility of rhizosphere communities to convergent \n\nadaptation and reduction of diversity in response to the carbon source. The fact that SML-paraffin \n\nselective culture exhibited the highest biodiversity is probably also the result of higher \n\nbiodegradability of paraffin, comparatively to more complex hydrocarbons. Since the structure of \n\nparaffins consist in long open chains of exclusive single bonds, while other more complex \n\nhydrocarbons present in diesel and crude often have double bonds or cyclic structures making \n\nthem much less biodegradable [4].  The average values (3 cultures) for the Shannon-Weaver index \n\nfor each carbon source was higher for paraffin cultures (2.5331) than for crude (2.2509) or for \n\ndiesel cultures (1.6726). This supports the hypothesis that paraffin is a more accessible substrate \n\nthus causing a smaller impact on the community diversity. The SML is generally considered as an \n\nextreme environment for microbial life from the physical and chemical perspectives where \n\nbacteria are adapted to respond to very sharp variations of  environmental conditions [81]. The \n\nresults may also indicate the higher degree of physiological redundancy of bacterioneuston, with \n\ndifferent species adapted for the performance of similar ecological functions, in contrast with \n\nsediment bacterial communities in which a particular function may be conducted by a narrower \n\nrange of physiological specialists.   \n\n The two communities with lowest Shannon-Weaver index correspond to the diesel \n\nselective cultures (DA and DR).  This is probably due to the lack of diversity of petroleum \n\ncompounds in the maritime diesel used, their low biodegradability, and the presence of some \n\ntoxic molecules such as phenols and sulphur compounds [4, 127]. \n\n4.3 Hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial isolates \n\nThe fact that SML is a microenvironment where several kinds of chemical compounds, \n\nfrom surfactants to hydrophobic molecules accumulate [128], especially in semi-closed aquatic \n\nenvironments like estuarine systems and in close proximity to harbors and urban areas [83], \n\nmakes it a prime place to find a high diversity of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. The main objective \n\nof this work was the search for biosurfactants producing bacteria but the option to use \n\nhydrocarbons as hydrophobic carbon sources also aimed the selection for hydrocarbon degrading \n\nbacteria.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n   Discussion \n  \n\n55 \n \n \n \n\n \n\nBy making a pre selection of isolates with different colony morphology and color, matrix \n\nof origin and carbon source used, we expected to obtain a set of the culturable fractions \n\nrepresentative of the bacterial communities in each selective medium. After selection by such \n\ncriteria, 111 isolates were cultivated and stored for further studies although only a sub-set of 66 \n\nisolates was actually typed by BOX-PCR for later DNA sequencing and screened for biosurfactants \n\nproduction. BOX-PCR results lead to a high number (58) of genetically different strains. Therefore \n\nit should be safe to assume that the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro has a diverse community of \n\npotential biosurfactant producers and oil hydrocarbon degraders. \n\nThe largest subset of isolates was obtained from the crude selective cultures. This is \n\nprobably due to the fact that crude oil is an extremely complex mixture of several kinds of \n\nhydrocarbons, and since each bacterial strain is only able to degrade up to two or three kinds of \n\nhydrocarbons compounds [22], a wider range of macroscopically different specialized strains is \n\ninvolved and a higher diversity of colonies was observed. Both the diesel and the liquid paraffin \n\nare much less complex mixtures with paraffin being much more easily degradable than some of \n\nthe diesel compounds (some of them aromatic) due to its chemical structure. \n\nThe rhizosphere sediment was the inoculum that produced the larger number of \n\nmacroscopically different colonies, rather than the SML water as one could anticipate from the \n\nvalues of the Shannon-Weaver index and because of the documented adaptation of \n\nbacterioneuston to elevated concentrations of hydrocarbons at the SML [81]. However because \n\nthe selection of colonies was based on their macroscopic characteristics, it is possible that the \n\ngenetic diversity of bacterioneuston was highly underestimated in the selection process. \n\nAlthough the capacity for hydrocarbon degradation was not directly verified in the \n\nisolated strains, some of them were able to clear crude from the solid MSM plates. As previously \n\nreferred, the clear zone around some of the colonies may be produced by processes of \n\nhydrocarbon solubilization by biosurfactants (removal and dispersion), hydrocarbon \n\nbiodegradation (mineralization), or by a combination of both processes. Some of the isolates that \n\nproduced halos in the MSM plates amended with crude tested positive for the production of \n\nbiosurfactants by the atomized oil assay.  However, the assessment of their potential for \n\ndegradation of oil hydrocarbons still needs to be accessed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n\n56 \n \n \n \n \n\n4.4 Biosurfactant production  \n\nOf the initial set of 111 isolates, 66 were tested for the production of biosurfactants with \n\nthe atomized oil assay [118], and from these, 17 (25.8 %) formed a halo surrounding the colonies \n\ncharacteristic of the presence of biosurfactant. The final number of 66 isolates tested resulted \n\nfrom the combination of the analysis of 32 isolates originated directly from selective pure cultures \n\nand 66 isolates from pure cultures in non-selective medium (TSB). \n\nA subset of 32 of the isolates were tested from both the selective and non-selective media \n\nand the results confirm the influence of the culture medium on the production of biosurfactants \n\nas detected by the atomized oil assay conducted in LB colonies. Seven isolates were able to \n\nproduce biosurfactants only when they had originated from the selective medium and not from \n\nTSA cultures. On the contrary, only 1 isolate was able to produce biosurfactant after cultivation in \n\nnon-selective medium and not when tested directly from the selective medium. In 4 isolates \n\nbiosurfactants production was detected in both selective and non-selective cultures and in 20 \n\nisolates, biosurfactants production was not detected. Some studies show that biosurfactant \n\nproduction can be enhanced by rich media [129, 130] while other studies use more complex \n\ncarbon sources, such as PAHs [73, 131], which may explain the differences in biosurfactant \n\nproduction by the same isolates when transitionally cultivated in different media [132]. \n\nSimilar percentual values of biosurfactants producing bacteria have been reported in the \n\nliterature:  26.9 % from petroleum contaminated soil [122]; 23.8 % from hydrocarbon-\n\ncontaminated environments [119]; 22.86 % in water samples collected from oil reservoirs [133]. \n\nHowever, different recovery percentages are often reported when using other carbon sources. \n\nThe use of the chemical surfactants SDS and CTAB as sole carbon sources  resulted in collection of \n\nsurfactant-resistant bacterioneuston isolates from the Ria de Aveiro, 9.6 % of which were \n\nbiosurfactants producers identified as Pseudomonads [134]. \n\nOverall, the environmental matrix from where the higher amount of biosurfactant \n\nproducing bacteria were isolated was the SML, with 6 out of 15 (40.0 %) positive results. This \n\nresult supports the fact that SML is a potentially rich source of biosurfactant-producing strains \n\ndue to its particular physical-chemical properties. Bacterioneuston have to survive the surface \n\ntension of the air-water interface producing surface active compounds such as biosurfactants for \n\nthat purpose. Also, the SML has structural analogies with biofilms and biosurfactant production is \n\na common feature of biofilm organisms with important roles in the regulation of the \n\ntridimensional shape of the biofilm [135]. This also applies to rhizosphere bacteria that often form \n\nbiofilms on plant root surfaces [136, 137]. The lowest percentage of biosurfactant producing \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n   Discussion \n  \n\n57 \n \n \n \n\n \n\nisolates was found in the sediment subset, with only 3 positive results in 26 (11.5 %). These results \n\nare not unexpected since there is little selective pressure in the sediment matrix per se regarding \n\nthe production of biosurfactants. In a study by Viramontes-Ramos et al. (2010) [138] only 17 \n\nbiosurfactant-producing isolates were found out of 324 (5,25 %) from samples of hydrocarbon-\n\ncontaminated soils. \n\nThe percentage of biosurfactants producing isolates was highest among the subset \n\nisolated from the maritime diesel selective cultures, with 7 positive results out of 22 isolates \n\ntested (31.8 %). Maritime diesel is, of all the carbon sources tested, the most similar to the \n\npollutants found in the proximity of the sampling site (due to the small harbors and leisure boats), \n\ntherefore microbial communities may be more prepared to use it as a carbon source and use it to \n\nproduce biosurfactants. Several bacterial strains have been isolated from diesel contaminated \n\nsites [139, 140]. Paraffin and crude oil selective cultures present the lowest proportions of \n\nbiosurfactants producing isolates, both with 5 positive results in 24 (20.8 %) and 20 (25.0 %) \n\nisolates tested, respectively. However this value is not far from the other values detected in the \n\nselective cultures enriched with crude oil [122, 133]. \n\nIn the overall analysis, the most successful combination for the isolation of biosurfactant \n\nproducing bacteria was the bacterioneuston inoculum and diesel as hydrophobic carbon source. \n\nThis combination produced the highest percentage of positive results with 4 positives out of 6 \n\n(66.7 %) isolates tested. Also, it corresponds to the selective culture with the second lowest \n\ngenetic diversity, which can be an indication of natural adaptation of the community. The least \n\nsuccessful combination was the sediment inoculum with crude as carbon source, because none of \n\nthe isolates retrieved from this selective culture tested positive for biosurfactant production.   \n\nThe metabolization of complex carbon sources such as hydrocarbons is often associated \n\nto the production of biosurfactants which in turn emulsify the hydrocarbons and enhance \n\ndispersal, making their transport into the intracellular compartment more easy and consequently \n\naccelerate biodegradation [141, 142]. In addition to the carbon sources, other growth conditions, \n\nsuch as temperature, pH, agitation, oxygen availability and nitrogen sources may influence the \n\nproduction of biosurfactants [61, 122]. It is possible that the conditions used in this work were still \n\nnot optimal for the production of biosurfactants and biosurfactants production in isolates that \n\ntested negative with the atomized oil assay may not be completely ruled out. Some of the isolates \n\nmay have produced small quantities of biosurfactant that were not detectable by the screening \n\nmethod used.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n\n58 \n \n \n \n \n\nThe results confirm that bacterioneuston communities represent a valuable seedbank for \n\nthe prospection of microorganisms with interesting capacities from the biotechnological \n\nperspective and that is a worthy environment to explore in the search for efficient \n\nhydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producers suitable for bioremediation approaches.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n   \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSION \n\n \n\n\n\n \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n  Conclusion \n  \n\n61 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nThe main objective of this work was to assess the biotechnological potential of bacterial \n\ncommunities from different matrixes of the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro regarding their \n\ncapacity to produce biosurfactants and to degrade hydrophobic hydrocarbons. Those bacterial \n\nstrains could be used in the future in bioremediation strategies of hydrocarbon contaminated \n\ncoastal and estuarine sites. Crude oil, maritime diesel and liquid paraffin were the carbon sources \n\nused because they are common contaminants and highly hydrophobic. The environmental \n\nmatrixes used as inoculants were SML water, rhizosphere bacteria and bulk sediment, which are \n\nrecognized as highly diverse microbial communities and in the first two cases as natural sources of \n\nbiosurfactant producing bacteria. In this work 9 selective cultures were obtained combining all \n\ncarbon sources with all matrixes, so that a comprehensive study comparing the community size, \n\ndiversity and frequency of culturable biosurfactant-producers of the different cultures could be \n\nmade. \n\nThe findings of this study allow us to conclude that the all micro niches studied had bacterial \n\ncommunities with a high biotechnological potential for degradation of hydrophobic hydrocarbons \n\nand production of biosurfactants. The most suitable combination for the retrieval of \n\nbiosurfactants producing bacteria was the use of diesel as carbon source and inoculum of SML \n\nwater since it presented the highest percentage of biosurfactant producers (66.7 %), although it \n\npresented a low Shannon\u2013Weaver diversity index when compared with the other selective \n\ncultures (1,5029). Bacterioneuston in particular, has shown great potential regarding the presence \n\nof biosurfactant producing potential hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria and community diversity, \n\nmaking it a prime place to isolate strains for future use in bioremediation strategies. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.
