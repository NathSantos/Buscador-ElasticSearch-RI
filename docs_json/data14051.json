Posttransplant \ndiabetes mellitus (PTDM) has also become a subject of  interest and importance in \nthe wake of  increased numbers and survival rates of  solid organ transplantations. \nThe liver is deeply involved in the regulation of  whole body glucose and lipid \nhomeostasis and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolic disruptions may play a \ncentral role in the onset of  IR, T2D and PTDM. Changes in hepatic glucose \nand lipid fluxes using stable isotope tracers and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance \n(NMR) analysis both in animal models and patients with IR, T2D or PTDM \nwere addressed in this Thesis. Moreover, further developments of  techniques \nfor the study of  hepatic glucose metabolism from fasting to dynamic situations \nwere challenged as well as for the integrated analysis of  hepatic glucose and lipid \nmetabolism.\n In Chapter 1, whole body glucose and lipid metabolism were reviewed \nand integrated focusing on hepatic metabolic disruptions associated with IR and \ndiabetes. Moreover, the stable isotope tracers and Magnetic Resonance techniques \nand their applications to hepatic metabolism evaluation were introduced.\n In Chapter 2, fasting sources of  endogenous glucose production (EGP) \nwere evaluated in control and high fat (HF) diet induced-IR animal models \nby using [3,4-13C2]glucose and deuterated water (\n\n2H2O) combined with carbon \n13 (13C) and deuterium (2H) NMR spectroscopy. Postabsorptive EGP from \ngluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in HF diet-fed animals was essentially \nidentical to the normally fed controls. The normal EGP rates found in HF diet-\nfed animals suggest that altered hepatic glucose fluxes are not involved in the \ndevelopment of  IR secondary to HF diet feeding, at least in the early stages.  \n\nXVII\n\n\n\n In Chapter 3, sources of  fasting hepatic glucose production (HGP) \nwere quantified in kidney transplant patients, undergoing cyclosporine A (CsA) \nimmunosuppressant therapy. A novel Bayesian analysis of  the position 2 and 5 \n2H NMR signals of  monoacetone glucose derived from urinary acetaminophen \nglucuronide following 2H2O and acetominophen ingestion was proposed for \nquantification of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis relative contributions to \nHGP. For kidney transplant patients, the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP \nwas significantly increased in the setting of  PTDM. This metabolic alteration \nwas found to be most strongly associated with adiposity and increased body \nmass index whereas CsA treatment per se provoked only modest alterations of  \nHGP sources and was not shown to be associated with fasting hyperglycemia or \nhyperinsulinemia.\n The fate of  an intraperitoneal (i.p.) glucose load by 13C and 2H NMR \nanalysis following administration of  [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O in healthy, HF \ndiet-fed and CsA-treated rodents was addressed in Chapter 4. The contribution \nof  HGP to total glucose was determined from the 2H-enrichment of  plasma \nglucose position 2 relative to that of  plasma water and gluconeogenic sources \nwere quantified from the 2H-enrichment level at position 5 of  plasma glucose \nrelative to that of  plasma water. The i.p. glucose load and \u201crecycled\u201d glucose from \nCori cycle contributions to total glucose were estimated from the enrichment \nlevel of  plasma [U- 13C]glucose respective isotopomers relative to that of  the \nload. Sources of  total glucose after an i.p. glucose load were further evaluated in \nHF diet-fed and CsA-treated animals. Both groups of  animals showed impaired \nglucose tolerance (IGT) relative to controls. HF diet did not promote impaired \ncontribution from HGP and insulin secretion by pancreatic b-cells was not \naffected. Thus, the IGT of  HF diet-fed animals can be attributed to decreased \nwhole body glucose disposal secondary to peripheral insulin resistance rather than \nimpaired HGP suppression. With CsA-treated animals the observed IGT was \nassociated with a higher HGP contribution to plasma glucose levels, suggesting \n\nXVIII\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nthat in this model impaired HGP suppression was a significant component of  \nIGT.\n Chapter 5 focused on postprandial hepatic glucose metabolism after a \nglucose load in healthy humans. Direct and indirect pathway contributions to \nhepatic glycogen synthesis during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were \nassessed by means of  two isotopic tracers ([U-13C]glucose and [U-2H7]glucose) \nfollowing ingestion of  peppermint oil and NMR analysis of  plasma glucose \nand menthol glucuronide enrichments. Exchanges of  both carbon and hydrogen \nmoieties during the direct pathway metabolism of  glucose were further revealed \nand quantified. During an OGTT in healthy humans, half  of  the hepatic glycogen \nsynthesis was derived from 3-carbon precursors (indirect pathway) rather than \ndirectly from the glucose load. Furthermore, during an OGTT, ~20% of  the \ndirect pathway flux was involved in transaldolase exchange, hence the values \nderived from the [U-13C]glucose tracer resulted in underestimates of  the direct \npathway contribution. \n Sources of  hepatic triglycerides accumulation in healthy and HF diet-fed \nrats, for evaluation of  hepatic triglycerides content by using a novel 2H2O and \n2H NMR methodology combined with in vivo proton (1H) Magnetic Resonance \nSpectroscopy (MRS), were determined in Chapter 6. In healthy rats, hepatic \ntriglyceride levels can be acutely raised or lowered by altering the dietary fat \ncontent and these changes can be effectively monitored by 1H MRS. During HF \ndiet feeding, essentially all of  the hepatic triglycerides were derived from dietary \nlipid with very little contribution from hepatic de novo lipogenesis. \n Finally, Chapter 7 presents the concluding remarks where all the results \ndescribed in this Thesis were integrated and further discussed. \n\n\n\n\n\nRESUMO\n \n\n Nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, a incid\u00eancia de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 insulina e de diabetes \ntipo 2 t\u00eam aumentado principalmente devido a altera\u00e7\u00f5es de estilos de vida e na \ndieta. A diabetes p\u00f3s-transplante \u00e9 igualmente um t\u00f3pico de crescente interesse \nconsiderando os n\u00fameros elevados e aumento das taxas de sobreviv\u00eancia actuais \nde transplantes de org\u00e3os. O f\u00edgado \u00e9 um org\u00e3o profundamente envolvido na \nregula\u00e7\u00e3o da homeostase corporal da glicose e lip\u00eddica. Como tal, altera\u00e7\u00f5es \nhep\u00e1ticas do metabolismo da glicose e lip\u00eddico poder\u00e3o ocupar um papel central \nno desenvolvimento de patologias como a resist\u00eancia \u00e0 insulina, a diabetes \ntipo 2 ou a diabetes p\u00f3s-transplante. Nesta Tese procedeu-se \u00e0 avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do \nmetabolismo hep\u00e1tico da glicose e lip\u00eddico em modelos animais e em pacientes \ncom resist\u00eancia \u00e0 insulina, diabetes tipo 2 ou diabetes p\u00f3s-transplante, utilizando-\nse marcadores de is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis e an\u00e1lise por espectroscopia de Resson\u00e2ncia \nMagn\u00e9tica Nuclear (RMN). Adicionalmente, foram desenvolvidas novas \nmetodologias para o estudo do metabolismo hep\u00e1tico da glicose em situa\u00e7\u00f5es de \njejum e em condi\u00e7\u00f5es mais din\u00e2micas, e procedeu-se a uma an\u00e1lise integrativa do \nmetabolismo hep\u00e1tico da glicose e lip\u00eddico.         \n No Cap\u00edtulo 1, o metabolismo corporal da glicose e l\u00edpidos foi revisto e \nintegrado focando as altera\u00e7\u00f5es do metabolismo hep\u00e1tico associadas \u00e0 resist\u00eancia \n\u00e0 insulina e \u00e0 diabetes. Os marcadores de is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis e as t\u00e9cnicas de \nResson\u00e2ncia Magn\u00e9tica assim como a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do metabolismo \nhep\u00e1tico foram introduzidos.    \n No Cap\u00edtulo 2, as fontes end\u00f3genas de glicose durante o jejum foram \navaliadas em ratos controlo e modelos animais de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 insulina induzida \natrav\u00e9s de uma dieta rica em gordura. Para tal, utilizou-se [3,4-13C2]glicose \ne \u00e1gua deuterada (2H2O) em combina\u00e7\u00e3o com espectroscopia de RMN de \ncarbono 13 (13C) e deut\u00e9rio (2H). A produ\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3gena de glicose resultante da \n\nXXI\n\n\n\ngluconeog\u00e9nese e da glicogen\u00f3lise determinada nos animais alimentados com \numa dieta rica em gordura foi essencialmente id\u00eantica \u00e0 dos controlos com uma \ndieta normal. Os fluxos normais de produ\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3gena de glicose encontrados \nnos animais sujeitos a uma dieta rica em gordura sugerem que as altera\u00e7\u00f5es \ndos fluxos hep\u00e1ticos da glicose n\u00e3o est\u00e3o envolvidas, pelo menos nos est\u00e1dios \niniciais, no desenvolvimento da resist\u00eancia \u00e0 insulina como consequ\u00eancia de uma \ndieta rica em gordura.   \n No Cap\u00edtulo 3, as fontes hep\u00e1ticas de glicose durante o jejum foram \nquantificadas em pacientes com transplante renal e terapia imunossupressora \nbaseada em Ciclosporina A (CsA). Foi proposta uma nova an\u00e1lise Bayesiana dos \nsinais de RMN de 2H das posi\u00e7\u00f5es 2 e 5 da monoacetona glicose derivada do \nglucuronado de paracetamol urin\u00e1rio, ap\u00f3s ingest\u00e3o de 2H2O e paracetamol, para \na quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o relativa das fontes gliconeog\u00e9nicas e glicogenol\u00edticas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o \nhep\u00e1tica de glicose. Nos pacientes com transplante renal, a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da \ngliconeog\u00e9nese para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o hep\u00e1tica de glicose \u00e9 significativamente superior \nnos casos estabelecidos de diabetes p\u00f3s-transplante. Esta altera\u00e7\u00e3o metab\u00f3lica \nest\u00e1 principalmente relacionada com a crescente adiposidade e aumento do \n\u00edndice de massa corporal. Por outro lado, o tratamento com CsA per se provocou \naltera\u00e7\u00f5es modestas nas fontes hep\u00e1ticas de glicose, n\u00e3o estando associado com  \na hiperglic\u00e9mia ou hiperinsulin\u00e9mia em jejum.  \n O destino de uma carga de glicose intra-peritoneal em ratos saud\u00e1veis foi \nestudado no Cap\u00edtulo 4, utilizando a an\u00e1lise por espectroscopia de RMN de 13C \ne 2H ap\u00f3s administra\u00e7\u00e3o de [U-13C]glicose e 2H2O. A contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da produ\u00e7\u00e3o \nhep\u00e1tica de glicose para a glicose total foi determinada a partir do enriquecimento \nem 2H da posi\u00e7\u00e3o 2 da glicose plasm\u00e1tica em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao enriquecimento da \u00e1gua \nplasm\u00e1tica. Por outro lado, a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da gliconeog\u00e9nese foi determinada pela \nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o da raz\u00e3o entre os enriquecimentos em 2H da posi\u00e7\u00e3o 5 do glicose \nplasm\u00e1tica e da \u00e1gua plasm\u00e1tica. As contribui\u00e7\u00f5es da carga intra-peritoneal de \nglicose e da glicose \u201creciclada\u201d atrav\u00e9s do ciclo de Cori para a glicose total foram \n\nXXII\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nestimadas a partir dos n\u00edveis de enriquecimento dos respectivos isotop\u00f3meros de \n[U-13C]glicose presentes no plasma em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao enriquecimento inicial da carga \nde glicose. As fontes de glicose ap\u00f3s a prova de toler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 glicose intra-peritoneal  \nforam avaliadas em animais sob uma dieta rica em gordura e com tratamento \nbaseado em CsA. Ambos os grupos de animais mostraram intoler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 glicose \nrelativamente aos controlos. Com a  dieta rica em gordura, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o hep\u00e1tica \nde glicose n\u00e3o foi alterada, tendo-se observado um padr\u00e3o de secre\u00e7\u00e3o normal \nde insulina pelas c\u00e9lulas-b pancre\u00e1ticas. Como tal, a hiperglic\u00e9mia p\u00f3s-prandial \nobservada provavelmente reflecte uma ligeira resist\u00eancia \u00e0 insulina a n\u00edvel dos \norg\u00e3os perif\u00e9ricos em vez de produ\u00e7\u00e3o hep\u00e1tica de glicose alterada. Por outro \nlado, nos animais tratados com CsA, a intoler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 glicose observada est\u00e1 \nassociada com um aumento da contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da produ\u00e7\u00e3o hep\u00e1tica de glicose.      \n O Cap\u00edtulo 5 focou o metabolismo hep\u00e1tico p\u00f3s-prandial de glicose \nap\u00f3s uma prova de toler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 glicose oral (PTGO) em pessoas saud\u00e1veis. \nForam avaliadas as contribui\u00e7\u00f5es relativas da via directa e indirecta de s\u00edntese \nde glicog\u00e9nio durante a PTGO utilizando dois marcadores de is\u00f3topos \nest\u00e1veis ([U-13C]glicose e [U-2H7]glicose), ap\u00f3s ingest\u00e3o de mentol e an\u00e1lise por \nespectroscopia de RMN dos enriquecimentos em 13C e 2H da glicose plasm\u00e1tica \ne do glucuronado de mentol urin\u00e1rio. As trocas existentes dos meios de carbono \ne de hidrog\u00e9nio envolvidos foram reveladas e quantificadas. Durante a PTGO \nem pessoas saud\u00e1veis, cerca de metade da s\u00edntese de glicog\u00e9nio hep\u00e1tico derivou \nde precursores de 3 carbonos (via indirecta) e n\u00e3o directamente da glicose oral \nfornecida. Durante a PTGO, ~20% do fluxo da via directa esteve envolvido em \ntrocas promovidas pela transaldolase, pelo que os valores derivados a partir do \nmarcador de [U-13C]glicose resultam numa subestima das contribui\u00e7\u00f5es da via \ndirecta.     \n As fontes de triglic\u00e9ridos hep\u00e1ticos em ratos saud\u00e1veis e alimentados \ncom uma dieta rica em gordura foram determinadas no Cap\u00edtulo 6 utilizando \numa nova metodologia baseada em 2H2O e an\u00e1lise por espectroscopia de RMN \nde 2H juntamente com espectroscopia de Resson\u00e2ncia Magn\u00e9tica  de prot\u00e3o (1H) \n\n\n\nin vivo para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do conte\u00fado de triglic\u00e9ridos no f\u00edgado.

Introduction \n \n Diabetes mellitus is a widespread and growing public health problem \naffecting over 171 million people worldwide. The World Health Organization \n(WHO) predicts that by 2030 over 366 million people will be affected with \ndiabetes. The growing worldwide prevalence of  diabetes is highly associated \nwith the increasingly sedentary life-style, together with access to energy-rich \ndiets in genetically susceptible individuals. Diabetes is directly responsible \nfor considerable morbidity and mortality, accounting for 5.2% of  worldwide \nmortality in 2000 (Roglic et al. 2005). Moreover, the secondary complications of  \ndiabetes, including cardiovascular and microvascular dysfunction place a large \nburden on health care (i.e., heart failure, stroke, blindness and end-stage renal \ndisease). Overall, treatment of  diabetes and its secondary complications are \nestimated to consume up to 15% of  the world\u2019s healthcare budget, hence its \neconomic impact is considerable. \n Diabetes is characterized by several metabolic disruptions that ultimately \nlead to hyperglycemia that can result either from impaired insulin secretion, type \n1 diabetes (T1D) and/or abnormal insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes (T2D) \n(Table 1.1). Insulin resistance can be defined as a state of  reduced responsiveness \nof  insulin-sensitive tissues to normal circulating levels of  insulin. T2D accounts \nfor the vast majority (85-95%) of  diabetes worldwide incidence. In the wake of  \nincreased solid organ transplantation and improved survival rates, posttransplant \ndiabetes mellitus (PTDM) and its adverse effects on organ rejection and quality \nof  life is also a recent and rapidly growing concern. Of  special interest is the \npossible role of  cyclosporine A (CsA) and other immunosuppressive agents in \nthe pathogenesis of  PTDM. To the extent that PTDM is associated with IR \nand glucose intolerance, its pathophysiology resembles that of  T2D but the \nunderlying mechanisms, which like T2D may include disruptions of  whole body \nglucose and lipid metabolism, remain unclear. \n\n\n\n? Chapter 1\n\nTABLE 1.1: Etiologic classification of  diabetes mellitus (American Diabetes Association \n2008).\n\n The liver is an insulin sensitive organ that is highly involved in glucose \nand lipid biosynthesis. The effects of  insulin in the liver are to appropriately \nalter metabolic fluxes of  glucose and lipids to maintain whole body homeostasis. \nMechanisms of  hepatic metabolism regulation by insulin include alteration of  \nmetabolic gene expression and modulation of  specific enzyme activities.\n The development of  IR and diabetes is closely linked with disruption \nof  hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. Classical approaches of  hepatic \nmetabolism assessment include rather invasive techniques such as liver biopsy \nor hepatic venous catheterization protocols. Currently, the development of  \ntechniques involving stable isotopes and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) \ncombined with the application of  safe and noninvasive methods, such as Magnetic \nResonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) have made it possible to \neasily assess hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in vivo in both animals and \nhumans.\n\n\t\n\nI.

Integration of  whole body glucose metabolism \n\n Whole body glucose homeostasis is maintained over the daily feeding/\nfasting cycle through tight coordination between glucose appearance and disposal. \nFollowing carbohydrate ingestion, glucose is absorbed from the intestine into the \nhepatic portal vein. It then enters the liver, where a portion (~20%) is directly \nremoved for storage as glycogen (Paquot et al. 2000, Petersen et al. 2001). The \nremaining glucose then enters the general circulation where it is consumed by \nperipheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle (Katz et al. 1983). The increased levels \nof  plasma glucose promote pancreatic b-cells to secrete insulin which induces \nperipheral and splanchnic glucose uptake while at the same time, promoting \nhepatic glycogen synthesis and suppressing glucose production from the liver \n(Rizza et al. 1981) (Figure 1.1). \n\nFigure 1.1.

Chapter 1\n\n In postabsorptive conditions, glucose appearance is entirely accounted \nfor by endogenous glucose production (EGP) once digestive absorption has \nceased. The ultimate step of  glucose production from endogenous precursors \ninvolves the hydrolysis of  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose by glucose-\n6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Thus, only G6Pase expressing organs such as the \nliver and kidney can account for EGP (Van Schaftingen et al. 2002). While low \nlevels of  G6Pase activity have been found on other tissues such as pancreatic \nb-cells, intestine and skeletal muscle, these tissues do not represent significant \nsources of  EGP (Ockerman et al. 1965, Khan et al. 1995, Gamberucci et al. \n1996, Chatelain et al. 1998, Rajas et al. 1999, Croset et al. 2001). Under extreme \nconditions of  acidosis or prolonged starvation, renal glucose production can \ncontribute significantly to glucose production (Ekberg et. al 1999, Moller et al. \n2001). However, under normal fasting conditions (i.e., overnight), hepatic glucose \nproduction (HGP) is the dominant source. HGP is regulated by insulin hence \nwhen insulin levels are low, as in the fasted state, HGP rates increase. Also, under \nthese circumstances, glucagon is released from pancreatic a-cells, promoting \nthe conversion of  glycogen to glucose by the liver and further boosting HGP \nactivity.\n While liver, pancreas and skeletal muscle have long been considered to \nbe the key tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, the role of  other tissues (i.e., \nkidney, adipose tissue, gut and brain) is now being recognized. For example, \nafter a meal, substrates stimulate the release of  satiety signals, hormones and \nparacrine factors from the gut (i.e., ghrelin, amylin, peptide YY, apoliprotein A-1 \nand incretins (Holst and Gromada 2004)) and from the adipose tissue (leptin) \n(Buchanan et al. 1998). These signals then enter the circulation where they can \ndirectly stimulate the central nervous system (CNS) and inform about whole \nbody energy availability. Subsequently, the CNS initiates and coordinates changes \nin energy and glucose homeostasis into peripheral tissues through changes in \ninsulin secretion, HGP rates and glucose skeletal muscle uptake (Sandoval et al. \n2008).\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ?\n\n1.2.1.Hepatic glucose intermediary metabolism and endogenous glucose \n         production\n\n Hepatic glucose metabolism plays an important role in whole body \nglucose homeostasis by maintaining a balance between the uptake and storage \nof  glucose and the release of  glucose in response to the nutritional status. \n After a meal, glucose is taken up by the liver predominantly by the \nnon-insulin sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT2) (Leturque et al. 2005). The \nincrease in hepatic portal vein glucose concentration activates glucokinase, \nthrough its rapid mobilization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and glucose is \nphosphorylated to G6P. G6P can be isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by \nphosphoglucose isomerase and further metabolized by glycolysis. Alternatively it \ncan be stored as glycogen. Elevated G6P concentrations act synergistically with \nglucose and promote the inactivation of  glycogen phosphorylase and activation \nof  glycogen synthase (Agius 2008). Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia increases \nglycogen synthesis by counteracting the action of  glycogenolytic hormones as \nglucagon and by activating glycogen synthase (Cohen et al. 1978). \n Hepatic glycogen can be synthesized directly from G6P or through \nan indirect pathway where G6P is first metabolized to 3-carbon precursors \nbefore being deposited into glycogen (Hems et al. 1972, Newgard et al. 1983, \nNewgard et al. 1984, Kurland  et al. 1989). Glycogen can also be synthesized from \ngluconeogenic precursors (i.e., lactate, gluconeogenic amino acids, glycerol) and \nthese contribute to the indirect pathway flux. In vivo studies demonstrate that \nfluxes through direct and indirect pathways of  glycogen synthesis are regulated \nby substrate and hormonal concentrations (Lang et al. 1986, Shulman  et al. 1991). \nIn healthy subjects, indirect pathway was found to contribute substantially (30-\n50%) to hepatic glycogen synthesis after a breakfast meal following an overnight \nfast (Taylor et al. 1996, Jones et al. 2006). \n \n \n\n\n\n? Chapter 1\n\n In postabsorptive conditions, when plasma glucose and insulin levels \nfall, the liver becomes a net producer of  glucose through the conversion of  \nG6P to glucose by G6Pase. Under these conditions, hepatic glycolytic fluxes \ndrop due to decreased levels of  the key glycolytic regulator fructose-2,6-\nbiphosphatase and gluconeogenesis is promoted. Gluconeogenesis represents \nthe generation of  glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates (i.e., pyruvate, \nlactate, gluconeogenic amino acids and glycerol) and includes anaplerotic fluxes \nfrom the tricarboxylic acids (TCA) cycle. Gluconeogenesis is directly modified \nby insulin through inhibited expression of  key gluconeogenic enzymes, namely \nphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase \n(F1,6P\n\n2\nase) and G6Pase (Barthel et al. 2003). In addition, insulin may inhibit \n\ngluconeogenesis by indirect mechanisms, as insulin-induced inhibition of  \nadipose tissue lipolysis that reduces both free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol \navailability for gluconeogenesis. Insulin also inhibits muscle proteolysis, resulting \nin a decreased availability of  gluconeogenic amino acids (Umpleby et al. 1996).\n Moreover, the increase in the circulating glucagon to insulin ratio, \ncharacteristic of  fasting periods, activates glycogen phosphorylase and the \nconcomitant mobilization of  hepatic glycogen stores to generate glucose-1-\nphosphate (G1P), which is then converted to G6P and glucose (Figure 1.2). The \nrelative contribution of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to HGP depend on \nphysiological conditions, hormonal factors and substrate availability. In healthy \novernight fasted humans, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis contribute \nequally to HGP. As the fasting period increases, hepatic glycogen stores become \ndepleted and the fraction of  HGP derived from gluconeogenesis is increased \n(Landau et al. 1996). At 60 hours of  fasting, gluconeogenesis accounts for more \nthan 90% of  HGP (Rothman et al. 1991).\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ?\n\nG\nly\n\nco\nge\n\nn\n\nG\nly\n\nco\nge\n\nn\n(n\n\n-1\n) \n\nre\nsi\n\ndu\nes\n\nP\ni\n\nG\nlu\n\nco\nse\n\n-1\n-p\n\nho\nsp\n\nha\nte\n\nG\nlu\n\nco\nse\n\n-6\n-p\n\nho\nsp\n\nha\nte\n\nG\nlu\n\nco\nse\n\nG\nlu\n\nco\nse\n\nF\nru\n\nct\nos\n\ne-\n6-\n\nph\nos\n\nph\nat\n\ne\n\nF\nru\n\nct\nos\n\ne-\n1,\n\n6-\nbi\n\nsp\nho\n\nsp\nha\n\nte\n\nG\nly\n\nce\nra\n\nld\neh\n\nyd\ne-\n\n3-\nph\n\nos\nph\n\nat\ne1,\n3-\n\nbi\nsp\n\nho\nsp\n\nho\ngl\n\nyc\ner\n\nat\ne\n\n3-\nph\n\nos\nph\n\nog\nly\n\nce\nra\n\nte\n\n2-\nph\n\nos\nph\n\nog\nly\n\nce\nra\n\nte\n\nP\nho\n\nsp\nho\n\nen\nol\n\npy\nru\n\nva\nte\n\nP\nyr\n\nuv\nat\n\ne\n\nLa\nct\n\nat\ne\n\nLa\nct\n\nat\ne\n\nA\nce\n\nty\nl-C\n\noA\n\nIs\nol\n\neu\nci\n\nne\nLe\n\nuc\nin\n\ne\nT\n\nry\npt\n\nop\nha\n\nn\n\nLe\nuc\n\nin\ne\n\nLy\nci\n\nne\nP\n\nhe\nny\n\nla\nni\n\nne\nT\n\nry\npt\n\nop\nha\n\nn\nT\n\nyr\nos\n\nin\ne\n\nA\nce\n\nto\nac\n\net\nyl\n\n-C\noA\n\nF\nat\n\nty\n a\n\nci\nds\n\nD\nih\n\nyd\nro\n\nxy\nac\n\net\non\n\ne\nph\n\nos\nph\n\nat\ne\n\nA\nT\n\nP\nP\n\ni\n\nH\n2O\n\nA\nD\n\nP\n\nU\nT\n\nP\nP\n\nP\ni\n\n2P\ni\n\nU\nrid\n\nin\ne\n\ndi\nsp\n\nho\nsp\n\nha\nte\n\n (\nU\n\nD\nP\n\n)\ngl\n\nuc\nos\n\ne\n\nU\nD\n\nP\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n8 9\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n20\n\n18\n19\n\n21\n\n12\n\n1\n\nA\nsp\n\nar\ngi\n\nne\nA\n\nsp\nar\n\nta\nte\n\nA\nsp\n\nar\nta\n\nte\nP\n\nhe\nny\n\nla\nla\n\nni\nne\n\nT\nyr\n\nos\nin\n\ne\n\nF\num\n\nar\nat\n\ne\nO\n\nxa\nlo\n\nac\net\n\nat\ne\n\nC\nitr\n\nat\ne\n\na\n-k\n\net\nog\n\nlu\nta\n\nra\nte\n\nS\nuc\n\nci\nny\n\nl-C\noA\n\nIs\nol\n\neu\nci\n\nne\nM\n\net\nhi\n\non\nin\n\ne\nT\n\nhr\neo\n\nni\nne\n\nV\nal\n\nin\ne\n\nA\nrg\n\nin\nin\n\ne\nG\n\nlu\nta\n\nm\nat\n\ne\nH\n\nis\ntid\n\nin\ne\n\nP\nro\n\nlin\ne\n\na\n (\n\n1 \n  4\n\n) \ngl\n\nuc\nos\n\ne\nol\n\nig\nos\n\nac\nch\n\nar\nid\n\ne\n(n\n\n+1\n r\n\nes\nid\n\nue\ns)\n\na\n (\n\n1 \n   \n\n4)\n g\n\nlu\nco\n\nse\nol\n\nig\nos\n\nac\nch\n\nar\nid\n\ne \npr\n\nim\ner\n\n(n\n r\n\nes\nid\n\nue\ns )\n\nG\nly\n\nce\nro\n\nl\n\n6 7\n\n10\n\n11\n\nG\nLU\n\nT\n2\n\n\n\n10 Chapter 1\n\n   Figure 1.2.

Integration of  whole body lipid metabolism \n\n Triglycerides account for the majority of  dietary lipids. Ingested \ntriglycerides are hydrolyzed in the gut and then absorbed in the small intestine \nwhere most of  the fatty acids are resynthesized into triglycerides. Afterwards, \ntriglycerides are released to the bloodstream through the lymphatic system in \nthe form of  chylomicron particles. Most of  the triglycerides are further removed \nfrom chylomicrons by hydrolysis in non-hepatic tissues, such as adipose tissue \nby means of  the insulin-stimulated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (Sadur  et al. 1982) \nwhereas a minor percentage of  triglycerides are taken up by skeletal muscle, by \nmeans of  a LPL insensitive to insulin. After a meal, the net effect of  insulin in \nadipose tissue is to enhance fatty acid storage as triglycerides with concomitant \ninhibition of  fatty acids mobilization and oxidation. These stored triglycerides \nserve as a principal source of  energy during fasting conditions.  \n In postabsorptive conditions, FFA are released from adipose tissue, \nthrough lipolysis of  triglycerides. Lipolysis depends almost entirely on hormone-\nsensitive lipase (HSL) which is activated by a fall in insulin concentration and \nincrease in glucagon levels (Meijssen et al. 2001). The rate of  adipose tissue \nlipolysis exceeds that of  fatty acid oxidation. Hence, a significant portion of  \nfatty acids are reesterified into triglycerides within the adipose tissue, liver and \nskeletal muscle. Under normal circumstances, most FFA released from adipose \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 11\n\ntissue are reesterified within the liver. Hepatic triglycerides can serve as local \nstores for hepatic needs or packaged in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) \nfor export into the bloodstream (Figure 1.3). Triglycerides accumulate in the \nliver when their synthesis exceeds their export via VLDL particles (Sanyal et al. \n2005).\n\nFigure 1.3. Patterns of  whole body lipid metabolism in postprandial (in green) and \npostabsorptive conditions (in red). LPL. lipoprotein lipase; HSL. hormone-sensitive lipase; \nFFA. free fatty acids; VLDL. very low density lipoproteins. \n\n There has been much interest in the role of  fatty acids in whole body \nglucose homeostasis as they compete with glucose for substrates, as first \ndescribed by Randle et al. (Randle et al. 1963). After a meal, elevated plasma \nglucose concentrations stimulate insulin secretion, which then suppresses FFA \nrelease from adipose tissue. This removes competition for substrate utilization \nin skeletal muscle and promotes whole body glucose disposal. Conversely, \nwhen plasma FFA concentration is high, usually as a result of  low glucose and \n\n+Glucose\n\nPANCREAS\n\nLipids+\nglucose\n\nChylomicron Triglycerides (VLDL)\n\nFFA\n\nFFA\n\nTriglycerides\nTriglycerides\n\nGlucose\n\nGly\ncer\n\nol\n\nInsulin\n\n+Insulin\nFFA\n\n-Insulin\n\nGUT\n\nADIPOSE\nTISSUE\n\nHSL\n\nLPL\nFFA\n\nLP\nL\n\nLIVER\nSKELETAL\nMUSCLE\n\n\n\n1? Chapter 1\n\ninsulin concentrations, fatty acids become the major fuel for skeletal muscle \nand glucose is spared for utilization by brain and CNS. Thus, the regulation of  \nlipolysis enables FFA availability as an energy fuel to be inversely related to that \nof  glucose.\n  \n1.3.1. Hepatic lipid intermediary metabolism\n\n The major sources of  hepatic fatty acids are: the uptake of  fatty acids \nreleased by lipolysis of  adipose tissue triglycerides, the uptake of  triglycerides in \nVLDL and chylomicrons remnants, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis from acetyl-\nCoA. Long-term control of  hepatic de novo lipogenesis involves changes in \nenzymatic activity and contributes to nutritional adaptations (i.e., increasing the \ncapacity for endogenous triglyceride synthesis in response to a high carbohydrate \nand low fat diet). Short-term control over the daily feeding and fasting cycles \ninvolves modulation of  enzyme activity by factors such as substrate supply and \nhormonal regulation. For example in the fed state, insulin promotes hepatic de \nnovo lipogenesis by: 1) activation of  pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA \ncarboxylase to form acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, respectively; 2) inactivation \nof  pyruvate carboxylase and lactate dehydrogenase; and 3) stimulation of  the \nfatty acid synthase (Wang et al. 1998, Sul et al. 2000), an enzymatic complex \nthat catalyzes all reactions for the synthesis of  fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and \nmalonyl-CoA. After a meal, excess fatty acids are reesterified to triglycerides \nwithin the liver.\n In postabsorptive conditions, the expression of  fatty acid synthase is \ndecreased with concomitant reduction of  hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Under these \nconditions, hepatic fatty acids are mainly oxidized via b-oxidation to acetyl-CoA \nand the main function is energy production for liver many metabolic activities \n(i.e., gluconeogenesis). Fatty acids b-oxidation is regulated by malonyl-CoA \nlevels that inhibit carnitine acyltranferase, responsible for the transport of  fatty \nacids to mitochondria (where fatty acid b-oxidation occurs) (Figure 1.4).\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 1?\n\nP\nP\n\ni\nA\n\nT\nP\n\nA\nce\n\nto\nac\n\net\nyl\n\n-A\nC\n\nP\n\nA\nce\n\nty\nl-A\n\nC\nP\n\nF\nat\n\nty\n a\n\nci\nd\n\nF\nat\n\nty\n a\n\nci\nd\n\nA\ncy\n\nld\nen\n\nyl\nat\n\ne \nm\n\nix\ned\n\nan\nhi\n\ndr\ne\n\nE\n-S\n\nH\n+C\n\nO\n2\n\nM\nal\n\non\nyl\n\n-A\nC\n\nP\n\nM\nal\n\non\nyl\n\n-C\noA\n\nC\noA\n\n-S\nHC\nE\n\n-S\nH\n\n1\n\nA\ncy\n\nl-C\noA\n\nF\nat\n\nty\n a\n\ncy\nl-C\n\noA\n\nC\noA\n\n-S\nH\n\nG\nly\n\nce\nro\n\nl-\n3-\n\nph\nos\n\nph\nat\n\ne\n\nLy\nso\n\nph\nos\n\nph\nat\n\nid\nat\n\ne\n\nP\nho\n\nsp\nha\n\ntid\nat\n\ne\n\nF\nat\n\nty\n a\n\ncy\nl-C\n\noA\n\nC\noA\n\n-S\nH\n\nF\nat\n\nty\n a\n\ncy\nl C\n\noA\n\nC\noA\n\n-S\nH\n\nF\nat\n\nty\n a\n\ncy\nl-C\n\noA\n(2\n\nC\n s\n\nho\nrt\n\ner\n)\n\nT\nra\n\nns\n-e\n\nno\nyl\n\n--\nC\n\noA\n\n3-\nL-\n\nhy\ndr\n\nox\nya\n\ncy\nl-C\n\noA\n\n\u00df\n-K\n\net\noa\n\ncy\nl-C\n\noA\n\nF\nA\n\nD\n\nF\nA\n\nD\nH\n\n2\n\nN\nA\n\nD\n+\n\nN\nA\n\nD\nH\n\n +\n H\n\n+\n\nC\noA\n\n-S\nH\n\nA\nce\n\nty\nl-C\n\noA\n\nH\n20\n\n2\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n4\n\n3\n\n8\n\nH\n2O P\ni\n\n9\n\nD\nig\n\nly\nce\n\nrid\ne\n\nT\nrig\n\nly\nce\n\nrid\ne\n\nV\nLD\n\nL-\nT\n\nrig\nly\n\nce\nrid\n\ne\n\n10\n\nA\nce\n\nty\nl-C\n\noA\nN\n\non\n-li\n\npi\ndi\n\nc\npe\n\nrc\nur\n\nso\nrs\n\nC\noA\n\n-S\nH\n\nC\noA\n\n-S\nH\n\nA\nM\n\nP\n\n\n\n1?

Disruptions in glucose and lipid metabolism \n  \n1.4.1. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes\n\n T2D is a heterogeneous and polygenic disorder resulting from the \ninteraction of  genetic and environmental factors (Romao et al. 2008). Several \nstudies revealed altered gene expression associated with T2D including a number \nof  genes that code for insulin signalling proteins. Apart from being a polygenic \nsyndrome, T2D is also characterized by hyperglycemia and other metabolic \nperturbations secondary to IR and/or relative insulin deficiency. Hepatic and \nperipheral IR are key pathophysiological events in the onset of  these metabolic \ndisorders and may precede the onset of  frank T2D by 10 to 20 years. \n The majority of  insulin-dependent glucose disposal occurs in skeletal \nmuscle where insulin increases glucose uptake by stimulating the translocation \nof  the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the cell membrane. At \na molecular level, multiple defects in insulin signalling have been implied in \nperipheral IR, including diminished insulin receptor number and affinity, altered \ninsulin receptor kinase activity, decreased phosphorylation of  intracellular \nsubstrates (i.e., IRS-1 and IRS-2) and abnormalities in glucose transporter \ntranslocation and activation (Saltiel and Khan 2001, Khan and Pessin 2002, \nSchinner et al. 2005). Thus, skeletal muscle IR is a consequence of  abnormal \ninsulin transduction pathways which culminates in the reduced uptake of  glucose \nby GLUT4 and a substantial decrease in insulin stimulated muscle glycogen \nsynthesis (Shulman et al. 1990, Cline et al. 1999, He et al. 2004). \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 1?\n\n In addition to impaired glucose clearance, there is also an excessive rate of  \nfasting HGP in IR and T2D. Consoli et al. showed that about 90% of  the increase \nin HGP in T2D can be accounted for enhanced gluconeogenesis (Consoli et al. \n1989). Elevated gluconeogenesis in T2D can be attributed to several factors, \nsuch as increased circulating levels of  gluconeogenic precursors, increased FFA \noxidation, enhanced sensitivity to glucagon and decreased sensitivity to insulin. \nAfter a meal in healthy subjects, ~20% of  total carbohydrate intake is stored as \nglycogen in the liver. Type 2 diabetics show decreased hepatic glycogen content \n(Magnusson et al. 1992). Defects in the process of  hepatic glycogen synthesis \nsecondary to hepatic IR may reduce the capacity of  the liver to remove glucose \nfrom the circulation thus contributing to postprandial hyperglycemia. Moreover, \ninhibition of  postprandial HGP is deffective in T2D.   \n Early in the development of  IR, pancreatic b-cells secrete sufficient \ninsulin to compensate for peripheral and splanchnic IR and normoglycemia is \nmaintained (Saad et al. 1989). However, when pancreatic b-cells are unable to \nmeet the increased demand for insulin secretion, hyperglycemia occurs (Szoke  \nand Gerich 2005). In a vicious cycle, hyperglycemia per se (glucotoxicity) and the \nadverse effects of  elevated fatty acids (lipotoxicity) (Shimabukuro et al. 1998, \nGrill et al. 2000) may also contribute to functional abnormalities and failure of  \npancreatic b-cells.\n It is well known that disorders in fat storage and mobilization are \nassociated with the pathophysiology of  IR and T2D, hence obesity and T2D are \noften closely associated (Lewis et al. 2002, McGarry 2002, Kelley et al. 2003). In \ntype 2 diabetics, the ability of  insulin to suppress FFA release from adipose tissue \nby lipolysis is reduced (Coppack et al. 1994). The resultant excess circulating \nFFA will be reesterified to triglycerides in liver and skeletal muscle (Perseghin \net al. 1999, Jacob et al. 1999, Virkamaki et al. 2001, Petersen and Shulman 2002, \nMachann et al. 2004). This ectopic accumulation of  triglycerides interferes with \ninsulin regulation of  glucose metabolism (Miyazaki et al. 2002). For example, in \n\n\n\n1? Chapter 1\n\nskeletal muscle, alterations in glucose transport activity are likely to result from \nthe accumulation of  intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) since this promotes altered \ninsulin receptor kinase activity. Increased hepatic triglyceride (HTG) content is \nalso implicated in hepatic IR (Ryysy et al. 2000, Marchesini et al. 2001, Kelley et al. \n2003) since it is highly associated with excessive fasting and postprandial HGP \nrates (Boden et al. 2002). Mechanisms include the stimulation of  gluconeogenesis \nand impaired insulin-mediated activation of  glycogen synthase (Samuel et al. \n2004). \n Apart from metabolic alterations in the liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas \nand adipose tissue, increased glucose reabsorption in the kidney, decreased gut \nincretin effects (Knop et al. 2007) and neurotransmitter dysfunction (Schwartz et \nal. 2005) also contribute to hyperglycemia in T2D (Figure 1.5). More recently, the \nlink between obesity and inflammation has raised the question of  whether obesity-\ninduced inflammation plays a role in the development of  IR and T2D (Shoelson \net al. 2006, Hotamisligil 2006). The concept that T2D has an immunological \ncomponent provides the basis for formulating hypotheses that this syndrome \nand related factors as IR may be promoted in situations of  immunodeficiency, \nas for instance patients on immunosuppressant therapy.  \n\n1.4.2. Posttransplant diabetes mellitus     \n PTDM is defined as the development of  sustained hyperglycemia \nfollowing an otherwise successful transplant procedure in patients without prior \nhistory of  glucose intolerance or diabetes. The reported incidence of  PTDM in \nliterature is unclear, mainly due to a lack of  consensus regarding the definition \nof  the condition. Incidences as high as 25% have been reported (Reis\u00e6ter and \nHartmann 2001). \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 1?\n\nFigure 1.5. Whole body metabolic alterations leading to hyperglycemia in type 2 \ndiabetes. \n\n PTDM is generally accepted to be associated with a greater risk for \nmorbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease and a greater incidence of  \ngraft failure (Weir and Fink 1999, John et al. 2002, Salvadori et al. 2003, Markell \n2004). Several PTDM risk factors have been identified including age, ethnicity, \nobesity, metabolic syndrome, hepatitis C infection and immunosuppressant \nregime (Jindal 1994, Weir and Fink 1999, Reis\u00e6ter and Hartmann 2001, Salvadori \n2003, Markell 2004, Marchetti 2004, Mora 2005). Throughout this Thesis, special \nattention will be given to one of  the most widely used immunosuppressant drugs, \nthe calcineurin inhibitor CsA, and particularly its effect on whole body glucose \nand lipid metabolism. \n\nIncreased lipolysis\n\nEnhanced insulin secretion\nIncreased glucagon secretion\n\nPANCREAS\n\nHIPERGLYCEMIA\n\nGUT\n\nADIPOSE\nTISSUE\n\nIncreased lipolys\n\nADIPOSE\nTISSUE\n\nDecreased incretin\neffect\n\nKIDNEY\n\nIncreased\nglucose\n\nreabsorption\n\nNeurotransmiter\ndysfunction\n\nBRAIN\n\nLIVER\n\nIncreased\nHGP\n\nSKELETAL\nMUSCLE\n\nDecreased glucose \nuptake\n\n\n\n1? Chapter 1\n\n 1.4.2.1. Calcineurin inhibitors\n\n Under normal circunstances, calcineurin induces the transcription of  \ninterleukines which are citokines deeply involved in the immunological system \nactivities. Calcineurin inhibitors bind to proteins called immunophilins forming \ncomplexes which bind to calcineurin promoting its inhibition. Thus, calcineurin \ninhibitors are associated with defective immune responses (Schreiber and \nCrabtree 1992, Kapturczak et al. 2004). The introduction of  the calcineurin \ninhibitors, such as CsA and tacrolimus (Fk510), in immunosuppressive regimens \nwas associated with a lower risk for PTDM. Nevertheless, CsA and Fk510 \nadministration was shown to promote glucose intolerance, hence these drugs may \nalso be diabetogenic, albeit to a lesser extent than for instance glucocorticoids \n(GCs). \n In spite of  some studies associating CsA with peripheral IR (Yale et al. \n1988, Wahlstrom et al. 1990, Wahlstrom et al. 1992), the diabetogenic nature of  CsA \nresults mainly from it\u2019s disruption of  pancreatic b-cell function (Doyle and Egan \n2003), whether by affecting insulin synthesis or impairing the insulin secretory \nresponse of  islet cells (Nielsen et al. 1986, Drachenberg et al. 1999, Hjelmesaeth \net al. 2007). PTDM in patients on calcineurin inhibitors treatment indicate that \ncalcineurin and its substrate (Nuclear Factor of  Activated T-cells) may be required \nfor b-cell function (Heit 2007). Furthermore, CsA administration is associated \nwith dyslipidemia by increasing hepatic lipase activity and decreasing adipose \ntissue LPL hydrolysis thus resulting in impaired VLDL clearance (Subramanian \net al. 2007). These disorders in fat storage and mobilization may in turn promote \nIR and contribute to PTDM.\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 1?\n\n1.5.  Clinical  assessment  of   hepatic  metabolic  disorders  in  insulin \n         resistance and diabetes\n\n In the development of  T2D and PTDM, IR is predominant and underlies \nthe failure in the stimulation of  glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, and impaired \ncontrol of  HGP. Therefore, as a result of  IR, fasting and/or postprandial \nhyperglycemia may prevail. Table 1.2 summarizes the current diabetes diagnostic \ncriteria by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (American Diabetes \nAssociation 2008). Typically, tests for assessment of  IR can be separated into \nthree different types: steady-state, fasting and dynamic measurement tests. \n\nTABLE 1.2: Criteria diagnosis of  diabetes mellitus by the American Diabetes Association \n(ADA) (American Diabetes Association 2008).\n\n1.5.1. Steady-state measurement tests \n Steady-state refers to the dynamic equilibrium of  plasma glucose levels \nwhich implies that EGP and/or exogenously administered glucose equals the \nwhole body glucose utilization rate. The gold standard method for quantifying \nIR is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp that was first introduced by Andres \net al. (Andres et al. 1966) and later developed by DeFronzo et al. (DeFronzo \net al. 1979). In the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique, exogenous \ninsulin is infused at constant levels to create hyperinsulinemia while the plasma \nglucose concentrations are kept at the euglycemic level using a variable glucose \ninfusion. Thus, in these steady-state conditions, the rate of  glucose infusion \n\n \n1)  \n\n \n2)  \n\n \n3) 2-h post-  \n\n \n \n\n\t\n\n\n\n?0 Chapter 1\n\nis proportional to insulin sensitivity and inversely related to IR. Also, EGP is \nmaximally suppressed such that the rate of  glucose infusion approaches that of  \nglucose disposal.\n Under steady-state conditions, the insulin suppression test (IST), exploits \nthe effect of  insulin on glucose disposal after endogenous insulin is suppressed \n(i.e., by means of  propranolol plus epinephrine or by infusing somatostatin). \nThe increase in plasma glucose levels following suppression of  insulin provides \na measurement of  insulin sensitivity.\n\n1.5.2. Fasting measurement tests \n Steady-state tests are quite laborious and time consuming, hence their \nroutine implementation is not possible in clinical centers. Therefore, indicators \nof  IR based on a basal measurement of  fasting plasma glucose and insulin \nlevels from a single blood sample have been developed. During fasting, glucose \nlevels are a balance between EGP and whole body glucose disposal and both \nprocesses are regulated by insulin. Thus, elevated fasting plasma insulin and/or \nglucose are indicative of  IR. Several models based on fasting insulin and glucose \nmeasurements have been developed, and validated against the hyperinsulinemic \neuglycemic clamp. For example, the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), \ncalculated from fasting plasma insulin and glucose, was first described by \nMatthews et al. (Matthews et al. 1985) and is indicative of  IR. More recently, a \nquantitative insulin check index (QUICKI) was developed and is derived using \nthe inverse of  the sum of  the logarithms of  fasting plasma insulin and glucose \n(Katz et al. 2000). These indices are suitable for epidemiological studies where \nlarge study populations need to be sampled. \n\n1.5.3. Dynamic measurement tests\n\n To evaluate IR in dynamic conditions it is necessary to perturb the \ninsulin/glucose system by providing glucose or insulin. During the intravenous \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ?1\n\nglucose tolerance test (IVGTT), metabolism is perturbed by infusing exogenous \nglucose and glucose clearance from plasma is assessed. The glucose clearance \nrates are proportional to peripheral IR. Alternatively, exogenous glucose can \nbe provided by means of  an oral load, such as in an oral glucose tolerance test \n(OGTT), or included in a more physiological mixed meal. Several models have \nbeen proposed for analytical interpretation of  the OGTT empirical results, such \nas the model-based insulin sensitivity (OGIS) (Mari et al. 2001) and the clamp \nlike index (CLIX) (Anderwald et al. 2007). Finally, glucose homeostasis can be \nperturbed by providing exogenous insulin and evaluating changes in plasma \nglucose levels, the insulin tolerance test (ITT). \n The tests described in here, in spite of  useful for assessment of  peripheral \ninsulin sensitivity and glucose disposal do not provide insights into the sources \nof  plasma glucose and therefore hepatic glucose metabolism. For this purpose, \nmetabolic tracers need to be incorporated into these assays.\n\n1.6. Isotopic tracers in metabolic studies    \n\n Until recently, assessment of  hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism was \nbased on rather invasive studies. These include needle liver biopsies, which \nallow a direct quantification of  hepatic metabolite concentrations (Beringer and \nThaler 1964, Nilsson 1973, Nilsson and Hultman 1973, Nilsson and Hultman \n1974), and catheterization protocols, which measure net uptake and release of  \nsubstrates by the liver (Madison 1969, Wahren et al. 1972). The introduction of  \nmetabolic tracers was of  fundamental importance for establishing the metabolic \nintermediates in the pathways of  hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism as well as  \nfor determining pathway fluxes. \n Following the development of  Mass Spectrometry (MS) and the \npurification of  hydrogen and other isotopes, the deuterium (2H) stable isotope \n\n\n\n?? Chapter 1\n\nwas one of  the first tracers used for in vivo metabolic studies (Schoenheimer et \nal. 1935). With the advent of  simple instruments for quantifying radioactivity \nvia scintillation counting and the availability of  a wide range of  carbon 14 \n(14C) and tritrium (3H) tracers, most of  the pioneering studies in mammalian \nintermediary metabolism used radioactive tracers. The development of  \nroutine radioactivity measurements coincided with the development of  paper \nand column chromatography techniques for separating complex metabolite \nmixtures. A resurgence in the use of  stable isotopes followed the coupling \nof  chromatographic separation with MS analysis in the form of  the Gas \nChromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument and the development \nof  improved sensitivity for the detection of  carbon 13 (13C), 2H and nitrogen \n15 (15N) nuclei by NMR. The replacement of  radioactive with stable isotopes is \nrequired for most studies involving humans and is mandatory for all studies in \nchildren or women of  child-bearing potential.\n Considering the composition of  biological substrates, 13C and 2H \nare widely used stable isotopes for in vivo studies. 13C has natural background \nabundance of  1.11% while that of  2H is 0.015%. Metabolic substrates for tracer \nstudies are enriched to a high level (99%) with 13C, 2H or both. Hence, for a singly-\nlabeled substrate, the highest attainable enrichment relative to the background \nlevel for that position is ~90-fold for 13C and ~6,000-fold for 2H. Since metabolic \ntracers may be diluted by 2-3 orders of  magnitude by endogenous metabolites, \nthe background abundance may contribute significantly to the detected isotope \nlevels. For 13C in particular, multi-labeled tracer substrates are preferred for \nmetabolic studies as the enrichment of  n positions in a given molecule results in \na substantially reduction of  background 13C-signals of  (0.011)n.  \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ??\n\n1.7. Tracing glucose metabolism with stable isotopes         \n      \n In postabsorptive conditions, liver is a net producer of  glucose through \ngluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. EGP fluxes can be evaluated by the \nconstant infusion-isotope dilution technique. Briefly, after a constant infusion \nof  a known concentration solution of  a 13C labeled glucose tracer, the infused \nlabeled glucose will be diluted as a result of  unlabeled glucose from EGP. Thus, \nthe rate of  appearance (Ra) of  labeled glucose in plasma is proportional to EGP \nfluxes. However, glucose carbons are recycled during their metabolism in vivo thus \nresulting in a higher enrichment than would otherwise be expected leading to \nlower dilution and concomitant increased EGP estimates. To avoid these effects, \nnon-recyclable tracers as [U-13C]glucose or hydrogen isotope tracers (i.e., [2-2H], \n[6,6-2H\n\n2\n], [2,3,6,6-2H\n\n4\n]glucose) are used where the carbon skeleton is broken \n\nor the hydrogens are removed during glucose recycling. Relative contributions \nof  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis sources to glucose production can be \nestimated by using 13C labeled gluconeogenic precursors (i.e., alanine, lactate \nor pyruvate) and measurement of  plasma precursor and glucose enrichment at \nisotopic equilibrium. \n However, the use of  labeled glucose and 13C labeled gluconeogenic \nprecursors present some drawbacks such as: 1) difficulties in determining true \nprecursor enrichments since plasma and liver enrichments of  the tracer may differ; \nand 2) the zonation of  hepatic metabolism could imply that the incorporation \nof  the tracer into glucose is not representative of  all hepatic substrates. \n  In the last decade, deuterated water (2H\n\n2\nO), has been widely used for \n\nevaluation of  fasting glucose production sources. 2H\n2\nO is considered a safe \n\nand relative non-expensive tracer that can be used in humans as long as body \nwater 2H-enrichment level is limited to 0.3-0.5%. The main advantage of  2H\n\n2\nO \n\nis the fact that rapidly equilibrates with total body water implying that precursor \nenrichment can be determined precisely from plasma or urine enrichments. \n\n\n\n?? Chapter 1\n\nMoreover, 2H\n2\nO is not affected by zonation of  hepatic metabolism as it rapidly \n\ndistributes through all tissues. After ingestion of  2H\n2\nO, plasma glucose becomes \n\nenriched with 2H at predictable positions depending upon the metabolic pathway \nthat resulted in the formation of  the glucose molecule. The quantification of  the \ndifferent plasma glucose 2H positional enrichments can provide information on \nthe gluconeogenic and glycogenolysis contributions to EGP (Landau et al. 1995, \nLandau et al. 1996). \n After a meal, glucose is taken up by the liver, used for glycogen \nsynthesis and EGP is inhibited. Consequently, the evaluation of  hepatic glucose \nmetabolism using stable isotopes in postprandial conditions is more complex. \nIn postprandial conditions, when there is absorption of  a meal or a glucose \nload, simultaneously with the intravenous (i.v.) infusion of  a tracer, the newly \nabsorbed glucose enters the portal vein and a fraction is removed by the liver, \nprior to entering peripheral circulation. Clearly, glucose meal and infusion tracers \nare not entering at equivalent points and the use of  a second tracer is usually \nnecessary, the dual-tracer method (Radziuk et al. 1978, Radziuk et al. 1987). \nWhereas the first tracer is infused intravenously, the second tracer is added to \nthe glucose as part of  the meal in order to calculate the systemic appearance rate \nof  both ingested tracer and total glucose. More recently, a triple-tracer technique \nwas suggested for estimation of  postprandial appearance of  total and ingested \nglucose, and the suppression of  EGP. The first tracer is infused at a constant \nrate during the basal period and the second tracer is infused during the basal and \nin the postprandial period, being its infusion rate altered in the later to simulate \nthe decline in postprandial EGP; finally, the third tracer is added to the meal \n(Basu et al. 2003). To date, dual- and triple-tracer methodologies, although very \ninformative, are quite laborious and require complicated mathematical models \nfor correct data extrapolation. Thus, in order to fully understand postprandial \nhepatic glucose metabolism, there is an urge for simpler protocols. \n Hepatic glucose metabolism assessment using stable isotopes is based \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ??\n\non the assessment of  plasma glucose, rather than by direct analysis of  hepatic \nglucose metabolites. To the extent that other organs (i.e., kidney) may contribute \nto plasma glucose appearance, the analysis of  plasma glucose enrichment may \nnot represent hepatic metabolism. To address this, xenobiotic agents can be used \nfor probing hepatic glucose metabolism. Xenobiotics are substances foreign to \nthe body that are conjugated to specific glucose metabolic intermediates in the \nliver by several processes (i.e., glucuronidation, glutamination, ribosylation and \nothers). For example, acetominophen and peppermint oil bind directly to hepatic \nuridine diphosphate-glucose (UDP-glucose) forming glucuronide that is excreted \nas urinary acetaminophen and menthol glucuronide, respectively (Landau et al. \n1991, Jones et al. 2001, Burgess et al. 2003, Ribeiro et al. 2005, Mendes et al. \n2006). The analysis of  the urinary conjugated xenobiotics provides a means of  \nnoninvasively assess hepatic glucose metabolism. In addition, by using these \nbiopsy agents, hepatic glycogen metabolism can be further assessed (i.e., direct \nand indirect pathway relative contributions to hepatic glycogen synthesis after a \nglucose load (Petersen et al. 2001, Jones et al. 2006)). \n However, xenobiotic agents are not appropriate for liver failure patients \nand may reflect hepatic zonation as the xenobiotic agent may only be sampling \none hepatic region. For example, hepatic glutamine is sampled by phenylacetate \nor phenylbutyrate as urinary phenyalcetylglutamine (PAGN) (Magnusson et al. \n1991, Cline et al. 1994, Jones et al. 1998, Jones et al. 2001) only in the perivenous \nregion of  the liver. Thus, the enrichment patterns of  glutamine may reflect that \nregion and not the whole hepatic metabolism.  \n\n1.8. Tracing lipid metabolism with stable isotopes\n\n During fasting, adipose tissue triglycerides are hydrolized to fatty acids \nthat are released into the bloodstream. The fatty acids rate of  appearance into \n\n\n\n?? Chapter 1\n\nthe bloodstream can be measured by the constant infusion-isotope dilution \ntechnique. Following infusion of  labeled fatty acids (i.e., [U-13C]palmitate or [U-\n13C]oleate), the Ra of  endogenous unlabeled fatty acids into the bloodstream \ncan be determined by calculating the dilution of  the infused fatty acid tracer. \nHowever, due to the reesterification of  fatty acids within the adipose tissue, the \nrate of  appearance of  fatty acids does not always reflect lipolytic rates. Under \nfasting conditions, plasma glycerol is all derived from lipolysis and is utilized \nexclusively by the liver as other tissues lack glycerol kinase. Thus, the Ra of  \nlabeled glycerol determined after a primed constant infusion of  [U-13C]glycerol \nor [U-2H]glycerol gives a direct measurement of  adipose tissue lipolysis rates.  \n Excess fatty acids in the bloodstream can be uptaken by the liver, \nreesterified to triglycerides, and then released from the liver as VLDL \ntriglycerides. Whole body triglyceride turnover is usually assessed by infusing \na labeled fatty acid (i.e. [U-13C]palmitate, [U-13C]oleate) or glycerol and the \nappearance of  labeled fatty acids in VLDL triglycerides is used to calculate the \nrate of  triglycerides synthesis (Wolfe  et al. 1973). Another approach is to pre-\nlabel the VLDL triglycerides with labeled glycerol or fatty acids. Afterwards, the \nVLDL are harvested by plasmapheresis and again infused into the subject for \nmeasurement of  fractional VLDL turnover rates (Wolfe et al. 1985, Sidossis et al. \n2004). \n The fraction of  hepatic fatty acids derived from acetyl-CoA by de novo \nlipogenesis can be assessed by using [1-13C]acetate combined with the acetylated-\nxenobiotic probe technique, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and analysis of  the \nsecreted VLDL. The SMX conjugates to hepatic acetyl-CoA and is later excreted \nin urine allowing the possibility to noninvasively assess hepatic acetyl-CoA 13C-\nenrichment (Hellerstein et al. 1991). Blood VLDL triglycerides are then further \nanalyzed and the 13C-enrichment in fatty acids from triglycerides determined. \nThe ratio of  enrichments in fatty acids from VLDL triglycerides and acetyl-CoA \nreflects hepatic fatty acids de novo lipogenesis turnover rates.\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ??\n\n 2H\n2\nO measurements have been applied with success to the study of  lipid \n\nmetabolism. For example, following 2H\n2\nO ingestion, the Ra of  deuterium in \n\nwhole body fatty acids is proportional to their synthetic rate (Schoenheimer  et \nal. 1935, Lee et al. 2000, Bassilian et al. 2002). \n 2H and 13C-enrichments in lipid molecules are typically quantified by \nGC-MS, a technique where ions are sorted out by their mass to charge (m/z) \nratio. Molecules that incorporate heavy isotopes, for example 13C or 2H, will have \na higher m/z ratio that can be resolved by GC-MS. Moreover, mass isotopomer \ndistribution analysis (MIDA) can be used for enrichment quantification of  \npolymers synthesized from repeating monomeric units (i.e., fatty acids from \nacetyl-CoA units or triglycerides from fatty acids). MIDA is a mass spectrometric \ntechnique based on combinatorial probabilities. The theoretical advantage of  \nMIDA is that the precursor enrichment can be inferred from that of  the product \n(Hellerstein and Neese 1999). Hence, there is no need to measure precursor \nacetyl-CoA enrichments when measuring hepatic de novo lipogenesis rates. \n\n1.9. Stable isotopes analysis by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)           \n\n Because of  the 13C and 2H nuclear spin properties, these isotopes can be \nmonitored and detected using GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy for quantification \nof  isotopic enrichment. GC-MS, is usually chosen because is more sensitive than \nNMR and due to its widespread application as a result of  the relatively low \ninstrumentation cost. However, if  multiple stable isotopes or labeling patterns are \nused to probe additional metabolic pathways, NMR has a significant advantage, \nprovided that its poor sensitivity is overcome by larger samples (10-100 mmol). In \nhumans, 5 mL of  blood and a urine sample easily fulfil this requirement for most \nof  glucose and lipid metabolites. NMR is a non-destructive technique, ideally \nfor repeated measurements. NMR principles are summarized schematically in \n\nFigure 1.6.\n\n\n\n?? Chapter 1\n\nFigure 1.6. Principles of  NMR Spectroscopy. NMR is a physical phenomenon based upon \nthe quantum mechanical magnetic properties of  certain atoms\u2019 nucleus (spin?0) when placed \nin a strong static magnetic field (B0) generated by a NMR spectrometer. A. The constant force \napplied, B0, to the nucleus magnetic momentum induces an alignment. If  the spin of  the nucelus \n=1/2, parallel and anti-parallel alignment corresponds to the two energy levels allowed for each \nparticular nucleus in presence of  a magnetic field. B. Stimulation of  the nuclei by an additional \northognal oscillating radio frequency (RF) magnetic field (B\n\n1\n) at the nuclei Larmor frequency \n\n(wL= g \u00d7 B0, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio) transiently swings these nuclei out of  alignment \nproducing a magnetization vector, M. C. When the RF pulse is turned off, the return to the \nlow energy state (spin-lattice T\n\n1 \nrelaxation) is associated with emission of  non-radiative energy \n\nin the form of  radiowaves that are detected by a receiver coil, the free induction decay (FID). \nMoreover, the nuclei can also fall out of  alignment with each other (spin-spin T\n\n2\n relaxation). The \n\nlength of  T\n1 \nand T\n\n2\n is closely related to molecular motion. The mathematical operation Fourier \n\ntransformed (FT) of  the FID originates the corresponding spectrum. Importantly, nuclei in \na molecule resonate at a given but unique frequency, depending on the molecular structure. \nThis is known as chemical shift and occurs because nuclei in different chemical environments \nexperience slightly different magnetic field strengths resultant from the shielding offered by the \nnearby electrons. \n\nB0 B0\n\nM\n\nB1\n\nA B\n\nC\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ??\n\n1.?.1. 1?C NMR\n\n 13C has a favourable nuclear spin (I=1/2) to NMR spectroscopy. \nAdditionally, 13C NMR displays a wide chemical shift range (~200 parts per \nmillion (ppm)), allowing a good resolution of  the 13C resonances. Moreover, \npeak signals in the 13C NMR spectra display narrow lineshapes, due to slow \nT\n\n1\n relaxation, allowing a better separation of  the distinct peak signals with \n\nappropriate correction for T\n1\n and Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE). A signal \n\nincrease in the 13C NMR spectrum corresponds to an increase in the 13C-\nenrichment and therefore can be interpreted as an incorporation of  label into \nthe carbon position under observation. These 13C-enrichments are referred to as \npositional enrichments and are easily quantified by 13C NMR spectroscopy. \n During metabolism, an isotopic tracer is submitted to pathway-\nspecific carbon rearrangements and, upon labeling with 13C, a specific range \nof  isotopomers is produced. For a molecule with n carbons a maximum of  \n2n different isotopomers exist. Multi-labeled isotopes are usually preferred for \nmetabolic studies as the simultaneously enrichment of  two covalently bound \ncarbon positions in the same molecule not only increases the signal intensity \nfor the two carbons positions but leads to homonuclear 13C-13C spin coupling, \nJ-coupling, resulting in new signals called multiplets (Figure 1.7). The appearance \nof  multiplets permits the resolution of  background 13C from 13C tracer \nenrichments.\n\n1.?.?. ?H NMR\n\n 2H is a nucleus with a quadrupolar moment and a spin of  1, resulting \nin broad signals in the 2H NMR spectrum except for small molecules where 2H \nsignals are relatively narrow. Moreover, 2H signals have low frequency dispersion \n(low gyromagnetic ratio- g/2p =1/6.52 that of  proton (1H)). This requires high \nmagnetic fields and/or derivatization of  molecules to forms where the signals \nare better resolved (i.e., glucose to monoacetone glucose (MAG)). \n\n\n\n?0 Chapter 1\n\n At last, as the natural abundance of  deuterium is much lower than of  13C \nit can usually be neglected. Following the administration of  a deuterated tracer, \ndifferent positional 2H-enrichments in a molecule of  interest can be associated \nwith different metabolic pathway fluxes, similar to what is observed with 13C \nisotopomers. 2H NMR spectroscopy allows the quantification of  the different \n2H positional enrichments. \n\nFigure 1.7. J-coupling arises from the interaction of  different spin states through the \nchemical bonds of  a molecule and results in the splitting of  NMR signals. Coupling \nbetween n equivalent nuclei splits the signal into (n + 1) multiplets with intensity ratios following \nPascal\u2019s triangle. Coupling between chemically equivalent nuclei (with equal chemical shift) has \nno effect in the NMR spectra and coupling between nuclei that are distant are usually too small \nto cause observable splittings. Long-range couplings over more than three bonds can often be \nobserved in cyclic and aromatic compounds, leading to more complex splitting patterns. For \nexample, in the monoacetone glucose (MAG) molecule, spin coupling between positions 1 and 2 \nis detected in the form of  line splitting of  the resonances of  carbon 1 position into doublets and \nis characterized by the line separation within the doublets, J1,2. When MAG is labeled in all the \ncarbon positions, the resonance in carbon 1 will be split into a doublet due to the spin coupling \nbetween positions 1 and 2. Further splitting will occur due to coupling with carbon 5 of  MAG, \nresulting in a superposition of  both couplings, namely a doublet of  doublets (Perdigoto et al. \n2003).\n\nH\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nC\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\nH\n\nH\n\nO\n\n2\n\n1\nH\n\nO\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nH\n\nC OHH\n6\n\nH\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nC\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\nH\n\nH\n\nO\n\n2\n\n1\nH\n\nO\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nH\n\nC OHH\n6\n\n1\n\nJ1,2= 33.6 Hz \n\nJ1,5= 3.9 Hz\n\nJ1,2= 33.6 Hz \n\nJ1,5= 3.9 Hz\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ?1\n\n1.?.?. 1H NMR\n\n The proton (1H) nucleus (spin=1/2) is the second most sensitive nucleus \nfor NMR, in terms of  intrinsic NMR sensitivity (high gyromagnetic ratio) and \nhas high natural abundance (>99.9%). Since nearly all metabolites contain \nprotons, 1H NMR is a powerful technique to observe, identify and quantify a \nlarge number of  biologically important metabolites. Due to 1H high sensitivity, \nit\u2019s a suitable nucleus for in vivo studies by MRI and 1H MRS. \n\n1.10. In vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy (MRI/MRS)    \n\n There are many tools available to assess the anatomy, dynamic and \nmetabolism in vivo. Whereas X-ray and Computer-assisted Tomography (CT) can \nprovide high-resolution structural images, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) \nand Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) present relatively \nlow-resolution functional images. MRI is a relatively safe, as no ionizing radiation \nis used, and suitable technique for the noninvasive investigation of  anatomy \nand morphology. Moreover, due to excellent chemical specificity as expressed \nin the chemical shift, MRS can be applied to the monitorization of  particular \nintracellular metabolite concentrations and kinetics. MRI and MRS techniques \nare based on the principles of  NMR and spatial localization of  the MRI signal \nis achieved by using magnetic field gradients that are used to create position-\ndependent magnetic fields. The principal nuclei studied are 13C and phosphorus \n(31P) (for MRS) and especially 1H (for MRI and 1H MRS). MRI exploits the fact \nthat proton concentration varies in the different types of  body tissues. Also, \ndifferent structures present distinct T\n\n1\n and T\n\n2\n values. Thus, different structures \n\nare revealed as these parameters can influence the intensity of  the proton signal \nin a predictable manner with certain pulsing/acquisition conditions.\n\n\n\n?? Chapter 1\n\n1.10.1. Assessment of  hepatic glucose metabolism by in vivo 1?C MRS \n Hepatic glucose metabolism is altered in diabetic states and assessment \nof  hepatic glucose metabolism is therefore crucial. The 1.11% natural abundance \nof  the 13C nucleus allows observation of  metabolites that are present in relatively \nhigh concentrations, such as glycogen. In vivo 13C MRS can be used for assessment \nof  hepatic glycogen metabolism. For example, the sharp signal at 100.4 ppm of  \ncarbon C1 of  glycogen can be used to measure hepatic glycogen at different \ntime points thus allowing the quantification of in vivo glycogenolysis or glycogen \nsynthesis rates without any tracers (Rothman et al. 1991, Grueter et al. 1994) \n(Figure 1.8). Increased sensitivity of  13C MRS can be attained by tracing 13C \nincorporation into glycogen during infusion or ingestion of  labeled glucose \n(Magnusson et al. 1994, Choi et al. 2002, Krssak et al. 2004). \n Moreover, the development of  technology that applies dynamic nuclear \npolarization to generate hyperpolarized 13C labeled metabolic substrates can \ntotally change the clinical potential of  MRS of  13C labeled metabolic substrates \nby increasing dramatically the sensitivity of  13C MRS in vivo. \n\nFigure 1.8.

Assessment of  hepatic lipid metabolism by in vivo MRI and \n            1H MRS \n Whole body and particularly hepatic triglyceride accumulation are closely \nassociated with the onset of  IR and diabetes. Whole body lipid metabolism \ndisorders can be assessed by anthropometric methods of  subcutaneous fat tissue \nand volume displacement measurements (Field et al. 2002). For measurement of  \nwhole body fat distribution, bioelectrical impedance analysis, ultrasound waves, \ndouble energy X-ray absorption, CT and MRI (T1-relaxation based contrast \nimages) can be used. On the other hand, before the introduction of  Magnetic \nResonance (MR) techniques (Szczepaniak et al. 1999), hepatic triglycerides \naccumulation was measured by means of  rather invasive liver biopsies or by \nqualitative ultrasound measurements.\n\nFigure 1.9. Hepatic 1H Magnetic Resonance spectra of  different subjects with progressive \ndegrees of  hepatic fatty infiltration. A single-voxel volume is defined in the region of  interest \n(ROI) of  liver and the 1H Magnetic Resonance spectrum obtained from this region. Resonances \nfrom water at 4.7 ppm and lipid at 1.0-1.5 ppm can be clearly observed in the 1H spectra. \nReproduced from (Mehta et al. 2008) with permission of  the publisher. \n\n 1H MRS can be applied to the noninvasive measurement of  hepatic \ntriglycerides (Figure 1.9). However, by using single-voxel spectroscopy, only a \nsmall volume of  the liver region of  interest (ROI) is analyzed, not accounting for \n\n\n\n?? Chapter 1\n\nintrinsic organ heterogeneity. More recently, the development of  more potent \nspectrometers together with continuous research on pulse sequence design, \nmade it possible to perform multi-voxel spectroscopy. In here, different volumes \nwithin the ROI are chosen and in a relatively short time, multi-voxel spectra \nobtained. The quantification of  the intensity of  the relative signals from water \nand lipids in each spectrum allows the performance of  specific metabolite maps, \nchemical shift imaging (Venkataraman et al. 2002). \n\n1.11. Scope, Aim and Outline of  Thesis\n\n In the last decades, IR and T2D are becoming more prevalent mainly \ndue to alterations in dietary and life-styles. PTDM has also become a subject \nof  interest considering the elevated incidences that prevail in posttransplant \npatients under immunosuppressant therapy after solid organ transplantation. \nHepatic glucose and lipid metabolic disruptions appear to play a central role in \nthe onset of  IR, T2D and PTDM. Thus, by using novel stable isotope techniques \ncombined with MR methodologies it is possible to study hepatic and glucose \nmetabolism disruptions which are associated with the development of  these \npathologies. The aim of  this Thesis is to define changes in hepatic glucose and \nlipid fluxes using stable isotope tracers and NMR analysis both in animal models \nand patients with IR, T2D or PTDM. Moreover, further developments of  \ntechniques for the study of  hepatic glucose metabolism from fasting to dynamic \nsituations are challenged as well as for the integrated analysis of  hepatic glucose \nand lipid metabolism.\n In Chapter 2, fasting sources of  EGP are evaluated in rodents by using \n[3,4-13C\n\n2\n]glucose and 2H\n\n2\nO combined with 13C and 2H NMR spectroscopy. In \n\naddition, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis relative contributions to EGP are \nassessed in a HF diet induced-IR animal model. \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 1 ??\n\n In Chapter 3, contributions of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis \nto fasting HGP are quantified in kidney transplant patients undergoing CsA \nimmunosuppressant therapy. A novel Bayesian analysis of  the position 2 and 5 \n2H NMR of  MAG derived from urinary acetaminophen glucuronide following \n2H\n\n2\nO and acetominophen ingestion is used.\n\n The fate of  a glucose load by 13C and 2H NMR analysis following \nadministration of  [U-13C]glucose and 2H\n\n2\nO in healthy, HF diet-fed and CsA \n\ntreated rodents is addressed in Chapter 4.  \n Chapter 5 describes postprandial hepatic glucose metabolism after \na glucose load in healthy humans. Direct and indirect pathway contributions \nto hepatic glycogen synthesis during an OGTT are assessed by means of  two \nisotopic tracers ([U-13C]glucose and [U-2H\n\n7\n]glucose), following ingestion of  \n\npeppermint oil and NMR analysis of  plasma glucose and menthol glucuronide \n13C and 2H-enrichments, respectively. \n Sources of  hepatic triglycerides accumulation in healthy and HF diet-fed \nrats by using a novel 2H\n\n2\nO and 2H NMR methodology combined with in vivo 1H \n\nMRS for evaluation of  hepatic triglycerides content are determined in Chapter \n6. Finally, all the principal results of  the previous chapters are integrated and \nfurther discussed in Chapter 7.\n\n1.12. References\n\nAgius L.

Introduction\n \n Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogenous syndrome with metabolic \ndisruptions that ultimately lead to hyperglycemia. While there are genetic factors \nthat contribute to T2D, it can also be induced by environmental factors, such as \noversupply of  dietary fat. Studies in both humans and animals have shown that \nan increased dietary fat intake results in reduced peripheral glucose uptake and/\nor impaired suppression of  endogenous glucose production (EGP) (Thiebaud et \nal. 1982, Ferrannini et al. 1983, Kraegen et al. 1991, Boden et al. 1994). \n In normal fasting conditions, the liver accounts for the bulk of  EGP \nthrough the hydrolysis of  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose via glucose-\n6-phosphatase and the release of  glucose into the circulation. Hepatic \ngluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis generate G6P and hence both pathways \ncontribute\tto\tEGP.\tSynthesis\tof\tG6P\tfrom\tthese\tsources\tis\tinfluenced\tby\tboth\t\nsubstrate availability and endocrine status. In healthy overnight-fasted humans, \nEGP accounts for ~10 mmol kg-1min-1 with gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis \neach contributing with ~5 mmol kg-1min-1.\tIn\textended\tfasting\t(40-60\thours)\t\nhepatic\t glycogen\t stores\t are\t severely\t depleted\t and\t glycogenolysis\t fluxes\t are\t\nlimited to ~ 1 mmol kg-1min-1.\tTo\tsustain\tEGP,\tgluconeogenic\tflux\tis\tenhanced\t\nand becomes the dominant contributor (Rothman et al. 1991, Chandramouli \net al. 1997). Gluconeogenesis results in the generation of  glucose from non-\ncarbohydrate precursors: the glycerol that enters at the level of  the triose-\nphosphates and all other precursors (i.e., pyruvate, lactate and gluconeogenic \namino acids) which are metabolised via\tthe\tanaplerotic\tfluxes\tof\tthe\ttricarboxylic\t\nacids (TCA) cycle. \n\t Flux\tchanges\tfrom\teither\tgluconeogenesis\tor\tglycogenolysis\tcan\talter\t\nEGP\t rates,\t and\t if\t EGP\t exceeds\t the\t rate\t of\t whole\t body\t glucose\t disposal,\t\nhyperglycemia occurs. In poorly controlled type 2 diabetics, overt fasting \nhyperglycemia is believed to result from enhanced EGP, mainly due to increased \n\n\n\n52 Chapter 2\n\ngluconeogenesis (Consoli et al. 1989, Hundal et al. 2000,  Magnusson et al. 2002, \nKunert et al. 2003). Gluconeogenesis may be stimulated in part by increased \nplasma free fatty acids (FFA) which supply the hepatic TCA cycle with an \nabundant\tsupply\tof\toxidizable\tsubstrate\tthat\tcan\tfuel\tthe\tsynthesis\tof\tglucose\t\nfrom pyruvate and other precursors (Coppack et al\t1994).\tMoreover,\tthe\texcess\t\ncirculating\tFFA\twill\tbe\treesterified\tin\tthe\tliver,\tthus\tboosting\thepatic\ttriglyceride\t\nlevels\tand\tcontributing\tto\thepatic\tinsulin\tresistance\t(DeFronzo\t2004).\tHepatic\t\ninsulin resistance refers to the inability of  insulin to suppress postprandial EGP \nand may be a key factor in the loss of  glucose homeostasis associated with \nobesity (Kim et al. 2003).\n In animal models, a high fat (HF) diet leads to insulin resistance and \nincreased hepatic triglyceride levels. Therefore, the HF diet induced-insulin \nresistance animal model is widely used for the study of  the pathological events \nthat\tcharacterize\tthe\tonset\tof\tT2D.\tHF\tdiet-fed\tanimals\tshow\tnormal\tfasting\t\nblood glucose levels, but are glucose intolerant and mildly insulin resistant as \ndemonstrated by impaired clearance of  a glucose load (Kraegen et al. 1986, \nStorlien et al. 1986). Given the role of  systemic lipids in promoting EGP \nand\tgluconeogenesis,\t it\t is\thypothesized\tthat\tthese\tfluxes\twould\tbe\t increased\t\nin HF diet-fed rats compared to animals fed with a standard chow (SC) diet. \nPossibly,\televated\tfasting\tEGP\trates\treflect\ta\tloss\tof\thepatic\tglucose\tcontrol\tand\t\ncontributes to glucose intolerance through a less effective suppression of  EGP \nduring a meal or a glucose load. If  the glucose intolerance induced by HF-diet \nis not accompanied by higher fasting EGP rates, the principal mechanism may \nlie with defective peripheral glucose clearance rather than with hepatic glucose \ncontrol. \n In order to investigate postabsorptive EGP rates, and the contributing \nfluxes\tfrom\tglycerol\tand\tTCA\tcycle\tgluconeogenesis,\tand\tglycogenolysis,\t6-h\t\nfasted adult Sprague-Dawley rats fed with a HF diet for 20 days were infused \nwith\ta\tmixture\tof\t[3,4-13C\n\n2\n]glucose and deuterated water (2H\n\n2\nO) tracers. EGP was \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 2 53\n\nquantified\tby\tisotope\tdilution\tmeasurement\tof\tinfused\t[3,4-13C\n2\n]glucose and the \n\ncontributions of  TCA cycle and glycerol gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis to \nEGP were estimated from the 2H-enrichment pattern of  monoacetone glucose \n(MAG) derived from plasma glucose. EGP rates and sources were also assessed \nin control animals fasted for 6-h as well as a second control group fasted for \n12 hours in order to determine if  the performed measurements appropriately \nrepresented EGP rates and sources during the fed to fasted transition.  \n\n2.2.

(Andover, MA, USA). \nOther common chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n2.2.2. Protocol\n\n The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use \nCommittee. Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in a room on a 12-h light-dark \ncycle under constant temperature (22-25 \u00baC) and with ad libitum access to food \nand\twater.\tAnimals\twere\tdivided\tinto\t3\tgroups:\tGroup\t1,\tfive\t(5)\t12-h\tfasted\t\ncontrol\tanimals;\tGroup\t2,\tfive\t(5)\t6-h\tfasted\tcontrol\trats;\tGroup\t3,\t6-h\tfasted\t\nanimals (n=6) maintained on a HF diet for 20 days. The HF diet used contained \n45% of  calories from fat, 35% from carbohydrate and 20% derived from protein \n(E15744-34, SSNIFF, Specialdi\u00e4ten GmbH)\u00ae, whereas the SC diet given to control \nanimals consists of  2.7% of  fat, 60% carbohydrate and 16% protein.

After a 60 min infusion, blood was immediately \nwithdrawn\tfrom\tthe\tdescending\taorta\tand\tthe\tliver\tweighed,\tfreeze-clamped\tand\t\nkept at -80\u00baC until further analysis. \n\n2.2.3. Blood processing\n\n Blood\t was\t immediately\t deproteinized\t with\t a\t final\t volume\t of\t 4%\t\nperchloric acid (70%) and centrifuged at 13,000 g at 4\u00baC for plasma separation. \nThe\tplasma\tsupernatant\twas\tseparated\tfrom\terythrocytes\tand\tneutralized\twith\t\nconcentrated\tKOH.\tSamples\twere\tfurther\tpurified\tby\tanionic-cationic\texchange\t\nchromatography and evaporated to dryness. The conversion of  plasma glucose \nto MAG was performed according to the literature (Jones et al.\t2001).\tA\tmixture\t\nof  0.5 mL acetone/mL original plasma and concentrated anhydrous H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n (40 \n\nmL/mL acetone) was added to the sample and stirred vigorously for 4 h. 10 \nmL of  H\n\n2\nO\twere\tadded\tand\tthe\tpH\tadjusted\tto\t2.2-2.3\tfollowed\tby\tincubation\t\n\nat\t40\t\u00baC\tfor\t5\th.\tThe\tpH\twas\tthen\tadjusted\tto\t~8.0\twith\tNa\n2\nCO\n\n3\n and the \n\nsolution\tevaporated\tto\tdryness.\tMAG\twas\textracted\tfrom\tthe\tdry\tresidue\twith\t\n5 mL of  boiling ethyl acetate, removal of  insoluble salts by centrifugation, and \nevaporation of  ethyl acetate. MAG molecules show the same labeling patterns \nas plasma glucose but with completely resolved 2H and 13C NMR signals.\n\n2.2.4. Liver Processing\n\n Frozen\tlivers\twere\tfreeze-dried\tand\tthen\tpowdered.\t30%\tKOH\t(at\t70\t\u00baC)\t\nwas\tadded\tto\teach\tsample\tin\t2:1\tfinal\tvolume\tratio.\tAfter\t30\tminutes,\t8\tmL\tof\t\nNa\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n 6% and 50 mL of  absolute ethanol were added and the sample incubated \n\novernight at 4\u00baC. The precipitated glycogen is separated from the supernatant \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 2 55\n\nby centrifugation at 3,000 g. The dried glycogen samples were dissolved in 5 \nmL of  acetate buffer 0.05 M (pH 4.5). 16 U of  amyloglucosidase were added \nto each sample and incubated for 10 hours at 55 \u00baC. The containing glucose \nsupernatant was then separated by centrifugation. Finally, glucose concentration \nin\teach\tsample\twas\tquantified\tenzymatically\tby\tthe\tglucose\toxidase\tmethod\tusing\t\na commercial kit (Invitrogen).    \n\n2.2.5. NMR Spectroscopy\n\n 2.2.5.1. 13C NMR Spectroscopy\n\n MAG samples were dissolved in 90% deuterated acetonitrile/10% \nH\n\n2\nO for carbon 13 (13C) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis. Proton-\n\ndecoupled 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian 11.75 Tesla (T) system \n(Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a 5-mm broadband \nprobe. Spectra were acquired at 25\u00baC using a 90\u00ba pulse and a 2.5 s acquisition \ntime. Typically 4,000-40,000 scans were averaged. \n\n 2.2.5.1. 2H NMR Spectroscopy\n\n While 13C\tNMR\tsignals\tof\tMAG\twere\tadequate\tfor\taccurate\tquantification\t\nin each blood sample, initial deuterium (2H) NMR spectra had poor signal to \nnoise\tratio\t(SNR)\tand\twere\tdeemed\tunacceptable\tfor\treliable\tquantification\tof\t\nthe H2, H5 and H6 signals (data not shown). Therefore, it was decided to pool \nthe MAG samples for each group for 2H NMR spectroscopy after acquiring \nindividual 13C NMR spectra. 2H NMR spectra of  pooled MAG samples were \nobtained using a Varian 14.1 T spectrometer (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, \nCA, USA) equipped with a 3-mm broadband probe. MAG was dissolved in \n90% acetonitrile/10% water and shimming was performed on selected proton \n(1H) resonances of  MAG. 1H-decoupled 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 50\u00baC \nusing a 90\u00ba pulse and a 1.5 s acquisition time. Typically 6,000-20,000 scans were \naveraged. \n\n\n\n56 Chapter 2\n\n 2.2.5.3. NMR Analysis\n\n 13C\tNMR\tspectra\twere\tanalyzed\tusing\tthe\tcurve-fitting\troutine\tsupplied\t\nwith the NUTS PC-based NMR spectral analysis program (Acorn NMR Inc., \nFremont CA). Analysis of  2H-enrichments was performed in an automated way \nby using Bayesian analysis (Varian Instruments) of  a 2H free induction decay \n(FID) signal from MAG pooled samples. \n \n2.2.6. Metabolic flux calculations\n\n Glucose rate of  appearance (Ra) was calculated from the known infusion \nrate\t (Ri),\t the\t enrichment\t fraction\tof\t infusate\t [3,4-13C\n\n2\n]glucose (Li), and the \n\nfraction\tof\tplasma\tglucose\tthat\twas\t[3,4-13C\n2\n]glucose (Lp), using Eq. 2.1 (Jin \n\net al. 2003, Jin et al. 2004, Jin et al. 2005b).\tThe\tfraction\tof\t[3,4-13C\n2\n]glucose \n\nin the plasma glucose (Lp) was determined from the ratio of  the areas of  the \ndoublet due to 13C-13C spin-spin coupling between carbons 3 and 4 ( J\n\n34\n=37.8 \n\nHz)\tcompared\twith\tthe\tarea\tof\tthe\tsinglet\tthat\treflects\t13C natural abundance \n(1.11%). EGP was calculated from Eq. 2.2 and is equal to Ra minus Ri. The \ncontribution of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to EGP was derived from \nthe ratio of  2H-enrichment at positions 2, 5 and 6S of  MAG (H2, H5, H6S), as \nshown in Eqs. 2.3 and 2.4. G6P derived from glycogenolysis has deuterium in \nposition\t2\tonly,\tas\ta\tresult\tof\texchange\tbetween\tG6P\tand\tfructose-6-phosphate\t\n(F6P), whereas G6P derived from any gluconeogenic precursor has deuterium \nincorporated\tin\tboth\tposition\t2\tand\t5\tdue\tto\tadditional\texchanges\tat\tthe\ttriose\t\nphosphate level (see Figure 2.1). Hence, the ratios of  2H-enrichment in positions \n5\tand\t2\t(H5/H2)\tof\tG6P\tand\tplasma\tglucose\treflect\tthe\tfractional\tcontribution\t\nof  gluconeogenesis to fasting EGP. The contribution of  gluconeogenesis was \nresolved into glycerol and TCA cycle sources as shown by Eqs 2.5 and 2.6 \n(Schleucher et al. 1998, Jones et al. 2001). \n\nRa= Ri \u00d7 (Li- Lp)/ Lp (mmol kg-1min-1)                                                           [Eq. 2.1] \nEGP= Ra \u2013 Ri (mmol kg-1min-1)                                            [Eq. 2.2]\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 2 57\n\nGlycogenolysis=\t[1-(H5/H2)]\u00d7\t100\t(%)\t\t \t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[Eq. 2.3] \nGluconeogenesis= (H5/H2) \u00d7 100 (%)                                            [Eq. 2.4]\nGluconeogenesis\tfrom\tglycerol=\t{1-[(H5-H6S)/H2]}\t\u00d7\t100\t\t(%)\t\t                [Eq. 2.5] \n\nGluconeogenesis\tfrom\tTCA\tcycle=\t[1-(H6S/H2)]\t\u00d7\t100\t(%)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[Eq. 2.6]\n\nFigure 2.1.

From the relative enrichments of  hydrogens 2, \n5 and 6S, the contributions from glycerol and TCA cycle gluconeogenesis, and \nglycogenolysis to EGP were estimated by Bayesian analysis and are shown in \nFigure 2.4\n For 6-h fasted control animals, EGP rates and gluconeogenic \ncontributions were similar to other reports from early postabsorptive stage (5-\n6 hours) (Sena et al. 2007).

In conclusion, the measurements \ndescribed in here appropriately describe the changes in EGP rates and sources \nthat occur in healthy animals during the progression of  fasting.  \n Animals on a HF diet showed comparable EGP rates to 6-h fasted \ncontrols with minor shifts in the EGP sources.

Discussion   \n \n Fasting hyperglycemia in T2D is often associated with enhanced EGP \nrates. Previously, postabsorptive EGP was found to be increased in animal \nmodels of  T2D. In the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) animals, EGP was shown \nto be increased due to elevated glycogenolysis as a result of  elevated hepatic \nglycogen content (Jin et al. 2005a)\twhereas\tin\tGoto-Kakizaki\t(GK)\trats\tincreased\t\nEGP is due to enhanced gluconeogenesis from TCA cycle (Sena et al. 2007). \nThus, in ZDF and GK rats with well developed T2D, enhanced EGP contributes \nto fasting hyperglycemia. To determine if  EGP is altered in glucose intolerant \nrats that show normal fasting glycemia, a rodent model of  HF-induced insulin \nresistance was studied.  \n\t From\tthe\t[3,4-13C\n\n2\n]glucose isotope dilution measurements, postabsorptive \n\nEGP\twas\tfound\tnot\tto\tbe\tsignificantly\tdifferent\tbetween\tHF\tdiet-fed\tand\tcontrol\t\nanimals.\tFurthermore,\tthere\twas\tno\tindication\tof\tincreased\tgluconeogenic\tfluxes\t\nin the HF diet-fed group. These results are not in agreement with a previous study \nwhere EGP was found to be increased in overnight-fasted HF diet-fed animals \n(Song et al.\t2001),\tdetermined\tby\tusing\t[6-3H]glucose as a tracer. However, their \npublished EGP values of  20-30 mmol kg-1min-1 are far below from the 50-70 \nmmol kg-1min-1 range from many studies (Jin et al. 2003, Jin et al. 2004, Nakahara \net al.\t2004)\tand\tthe\tvalue\tof\t67\t\u00b1\t8\tmmol kg-1min-1 reported in here. \n The results presented in here show that for HF diet-fed animals, \npostabsorptive EGP from gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis was essentially \nidentical to the normally fed controls. These data therefore provide no indication \nof  stimulated hepatic gluconeogenesis in the fasted state as a result of  the HF \ndiet. However, further studies are necessary to determine if  HF diet induced \nglucose intolerance results from altered whole body glucose disposal, failure of  \nnormal inhibition of  postprandial EGP or a combination of  both. HF diet-\nfed animals present some important early markers of  T2D pathology including \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 2 65\n\nglucose intolerance and increased hepatic triglyceride levels. However, the \nnormal EGP and gluconeogenesis rates that were found in glucose-intolerant \nHF\tdiet-fed\tanimals\tsuggest\tthat\taltered\thepatic\tglucose\tfluxes\tare\tnot\tinvolved\t\nin the development of  fasting hyperglycemia and insulin resistance secondary to \nhigh fat feeding, at least in the early stages.  \n These conclusions concur with clinical studies where postabsorptive \nEGP and gluconeogenic rates are normal in mildly hyperglycemic diabetics and \nare\tonly\tsignificantly\tenhanced\tin\tsevere\thyperglycemic\ttype\t2\tdiabetics\t(Boden \net al. 2001). These studies suggest that increases in postabsorptive EGP and \ngluconeogenesis rates are preceded by other defects of  glucose homeostasis such \nas insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in the pathogenesis of  T2D. Rather, \nthe involvement of  elevated EGP and gluconeogenesis is associated with the \nonset of  severe fasting hyperglycemia, a relatively late event in the development \nof  T2D.  \n\n2.5.

Introduction\n\nPlasma glucose levels are maintained over the daily feeding/fasting \ncycle through tight coordination of  glucose appearance and disposal. During \novernight fasting, glucose appearance is entirely accounted for by endogenous \nglucose production (EGP) once digestive absorption has ceased. Hepatic glucose \nproduction (HGP) is the principal contributor to EGP and both gluconeogenesis \nand glycogenolysis contribute to fasting HGP. The occurrence of  hyperglycemia \nafter overnight fasting is a hallmark of  defective glucose metabolism and indicates \na mismatch between glucose production and plasma glucose clearance. Impaired \nglucose uptake by peripheral tissues and inappropriately high levels of  HGP can \nboth contribute to this condition. Among other things, resolving these underlying \ndefects could prove useful for guiding and evaluating interventions of  fasting \nhyperglycemia since some antihyperglycemic medications act by inhibiting HGP \nwhile others function by improving whole body glucose uptake.\n Systemic glucose metabolism is typically assessed in the clinical setting by \nquantifying plasma glucose levels before and after an oral glucose load but this \napproach does not provide any information about hepatic glucose metabolism. \nAssessment of  HGP with stable isotope tracers could provide useful information \nto complement measurements of  plasma glucose clearance but current methods \nare poorly suited for routine clinical studies. This is due to several factors including \nhigh tracer cost, the requirement for lengthy infusion times for administration \nof  the tracer, and extensive sample processing and analysis.\n Deuterated water (2H\n\n2\nO) is an inexpensive tracer of  gluconeogenesis \n\nthat can be administered orally and is therefore well suited for routine clinical \nstudy procedures. The metabolic information is derived from the analysis of  \nthe deuterium (2H)-enrichment distribution of  plasma glucose (Jones et al. 2001, \nBoden et al. 2001, Landau et al. 1996, Chandramouli et al. 1997, Perdigoto et \nal. 2003, Weis et al. 2004, Chevalier et al. 2006). Current Gas Chromatography-\n\n\n\n72 Chapter 3\n\nMass Spectrometry (GC-MS) methods, while highly sensitive and therefore \napplicable to small blood samples, are labor intensive and poorly suited for \nhigh sample throughputs. Analysis by 2H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) \nspectroscopy of  the monoacetone glucose (MAG) derivative of  plasma glucose \nis less sensitive but far simpler to the extent that both sample preparation and \nNMR spectroscopy can be extensively automated with current technologies. \nConversion of  plasma glucose to MAG has been successfully performed with \na commercially available robotic chemical synthesizer (Burgess et al. 2002) and \nhigh-resolution 2H NMR spectra of  the product can be obtained with automated \ntuning/shimming routines and minimal technical oversight. The contribution of  \ngluconeogenic and glycogenolytic fluxes to HGP can be automatically obtained \nfrom the 2H NMR signal by Bayesian/Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) \nanalysis of  the free induction decay (FID) (Merritt et al. 2003). The analysis also \nprovides estimates of  uncertainty levels for the flux parameters. Data modeling \nstudies indicate that these uncertainty levels are heavily influenced by the signal \nto noise ratio (SNR) of  the 2H NMR signals. Obtention of  2H NMR signals \nwith suitable SNR for Bayesian analysis requires a large sample size (~30 mL of  \nwhole blood) and/or long NMR collection times thereby limiting the practicality \nand throughput of  the method.\n\nWhen acetaminophen is provided and due to rapid exchange between \nhepatic glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) the 2H-\nenrichment distribution of  plasma glucose is also reflected in hydrogens 1-5 of  \nthe acetaminophen glucuronide excreted in urine (Burgess et al. 2003) (Figure 3.1). \nIn addition to eliminating the need to collect and rapidly process blood samples, \nthe quantity of  urinary glucuronide that is available for analysis is typically 5-\n10 times that of  plasma glucose. Under these conditions, it is anticipated that \n2H NMR spectra with sufficient SNR to yield reasonably precise estimates of  \ngluconeogenesis by Bayesian analysis could be obtained without prohibitively \nlong NMR collection times. The Bayesian method is ideal for analyzing data of  \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 3 73\n\nthis type. Experimental time constraints prevent repeated measurements upon \nthe same sample in order to construct a more traditional statistical estimate of  \nthe uncertainty, i.e., the mean and standard deviation (SD) of  repeated NMR \nspectra for a given sample. The Bayesian formulation of  this problem uses prior \nknowledge regarding the shifts and amplitudes of  the relevant resonances as \nwell as a model for the \u201cnuisance\u201d resonances that are not important for the \nmetabolic measurements. A MCMC simulation makes multiple independent \nanalyses of  the posterior probability distribution that define the metabolic \nmeasurement. This provides an estimate of  the most probable values of  the \nmetabolic parameters as well as the uncertainty value for each parameter.\n\nFigure 3.1.

The analysis was applied to healthy subjects and \n\nto kidney transplant (KTx) recipients, including a subgroup diagnosed with \nposttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). The development of  hyperglycemia and \nPTDM is a frequent event following kidney transplantation (Salvadori et al. 2003, \nMarkell 2004). This may involve several factors, including increased adiposity, and \nglucose intolerance resulting from posttransplant weight gain, age and ethnicity \n(Salvadori et al. 2003), as well as the direct action of  immunosuppressive agents \nsuch as glucocorticoids (GCs) and the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A \n(CsA), on insulin secretion and sensitivity (Jindal et al. 1997, Markell 2001). The \nactivity of  hepatic gluconeogenesis and its contribution to posttransplant fasting \nhyperglycemia under these conditions is not known. In this study, sources of  \nfasting HGP derived by Bayesian analysis were collated with plasma metabolite \nand insulin sensitivity measurements.\n\n3.2. Materials and methods\n\n3.2.1. Human studies\n\n The study protocol was approved by the University Hospital of  \nCoimbra Ethics Committee and was performed in accordance with the ethical \nstandards laid down in the Helsinki Declaration. Subjects were studied in the \nDepartment of  Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes in the University \nHospital of  Coimbra after informed consent. Three groups were studied as \nfollows: Group 1, six healthy, lean normoglycemic controls; Group 2, seven lean, \nnormoglycemic patients with a functional KTx with stable ongoing CsA-based \ntherapy; and Group 3, three obese and hyperglycemic patients with a functional \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 3 75\n\nrenal transplant and CsA-based therapy. All KTx patients received 200-400 mg/\nday of  CsA in conjunction with a low dose of  GCs (5 mg/day).\n \n3.2.2. 2H2O administration and sampling\n\nFasting was started at 20:00 (24-h clock) on the previous evening after a \nnormal dinner meal. At 01:00 and 03:00 on the next day, patients were given two \nloading doses of  2H\n\n2\nO (2.5 g/kg of  body water) to achieve a target body water \n\nenrichment of  0.5% 2H\n2\nO. Body water was assumed to be 60% of  body weight \n\nfor males and 50% of  body weight for females. To improve palatability and \ndecrease the risk of  vertigo each loading was diluted with bottled spring water to \ngive a final enrichment of  35% 2H\n\n2\nO. Acetaminophen (1000 mg) was also taken \n\nat 03:00 h. At 06:00 h the patients were asked to empty their bladder and all urine \nwas collected from 06:00-08:00 h. Blood for clinical analysis was also drawn at \n06:00 and 08:00 (Figure 3.2).\n \n\nFigure 3.2. Schematic protocol design.

Biochemical analysis\n\n\t Blood collected after 10 h of  fasting was analyzed for plasma glucose, \ninsulin, C peptide, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin, \ncreatinine and ureic nitrogen levels in the laboratories of  the University Hospital \nof  Coimbra. Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) were determined independently, using \nan enzymatic colorimetric method kit from Wako Chemicals GmbH, in plasma \ncollected after 12 h of  fasting.\n\n3.2.4. Sample processing\n\n Acetaminophen glucuronide from the 06:00-08:00 h urine samples was \nderived to MAG as previously described (Jones et al. 2006a, Jones et al. 2006b). \nBriefly, urine was concentrated by evaporation to 10% of  its original volume and \nthis portion was mixed with 9 volumes of  ethanol (100%). The precipitate was \ncentrifuged, the supernatant was evaporated to ~10 mL and the pH was adjusted \nto 8.0-9.0 with 1M NaOH. The supernatant was applied to an 18 \u00d7 1 cm diameter \nDowex-1X8-200-acetate column. The column was washed with 35 mL of  water, \nthe glucuronide eluted with 35 mL of  10 M acetic acid, and the collected acetic acid \nfraction was evaporated to dryness at 40-50 \u00baC. The residue was resuspended in \n50 mL water and the pH was adjusted to 4.5-5.0. The acetaminophen glucuronide \nin this solution was derivatized to monoacetoneglucuronic lactone (MAGL). Two \nthousand units of  ?-glucuronidase (H. Pomatia, Sigma Chemical Company) were \nadded and the solution was incubated at 45\u00baC for 48 h. The solution was then \npassed through 10 mL Dowex-50X8-200 H+ ion-exchange resin and evaporated \nto complete dryness at 40 \u00baC resulting in the conversion of  free glucuronic acid \nto glucuronolactone. The lactone was converted to MAGL by stirring for 24 h \nwith 5 mL of  anhydrous acetone and 0.1 mL concentrated H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n. The yellow \n\nsolution was mixed with 5 mL water, the pH adjusted to between 4 and  5  with  \n0.5 M Na\n\n2\nCO\n\n3\n and the solution evaporated to dryness at room temperature. \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 3 77\n\nMAGL was extracted from the salt products with 2-3 mL acetonitrile and \nreduced to MAG with lithium borohydride using tetrahydrofuran as the solvent. \nMAG molecules show the same labeling patterns as urinary acetominophen \nglucuronide but with completely resolved 2H NMR signals.\n\n3.2.5. 2H NMR spectroscopy\n\n 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 11.75 Tesla (T) with a Varian spectrometer \nequipped with a 5-mm broadband \u201cswitchable\u201d probe with z-gradient (Varian, Palo \nAlto, CA, USA). MAG was dissolved in 90% acetonitrile/10% water and shimming \nwas performed on selected proton (1H) resonances of  MAG. 1H-decoupled 2H \nNMR spectra were acquired without field-frequency lock at 50\u00baC using a 90\u00ba pulse \nand a 1.6 s acquisition time. Typically 6,000-30,000 FID were collected (2.7-13.5 h \ntotal collection time). For the determination of  urine water 2H-enrichment, spectra \nwere obtained at 25\u00baC using a 22.5\u00ba pulse and a 4 s acquisition time (Jones et al. \n2001b). \n\n3.2.6. Bayesian/MCMC analysis of  glucuronide metabolic fluxes\n\n G6P derived from glycogenolysis has deuterium in position 2, as a result \nof  exchange between G6P and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) whereas G6P derived \nfrom any gluconeogenic precursor has deuterium incorporated in both position \n2 and 5 due to additional exchanges at the triose phosphate level (Figure 3.1). \nHence, the ratios of  2H-enrichment in positions 5 and 2 (H5/H2) of  G6P and \nplasma glucose reflect the fractional contribution of  gluconeogenesis to fasting \nglucose production. The glucuronide moiety of  acetaminophen is assumed to be \nderived from the hepatic uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDP-glucose) pool that is \nin isotopic steady state with hepatic G6P as a result of  rapid G6P-G1P exchange \n(Schwenk and Kahl 1996). On this basis, glucuronide H5/H2 is identical to \nthat of  hepatic G6P and the fractional contributions of  gluconeogenesis and \nglycogenolysis to HGP are given by the following equations:\n\n\n\n78 Chapter 3\n\nGluconeogenesis fraction = Glucuronide H5/Glucuronide H2 \u00d7100 (%)   [Eq. 3.1]\n\nGlycogenolysis fraction = 1 \u2013 (Glucuronide H5/Glucuronide H2) \u00d7100 (%)  [Eq. 3.2]\n\n The H5/H2 parameter is thus obtained from the ratio of  the glucuronide \n2H NMR signals for these positions. This parameter can be obtained in an \noperator-independent manner by Bayesian analysis of  the FID as previously \ndescribed (Merritt et al. 2003). The posterior probability distribution for the \ngluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis fractions was obtained from a MCMC \nsimulation consisting of  50 independent Markov chains, from each of  which 50 \nindependent samples were drawn (a total of  2,500 samples (Merritt et al. 2003)). \nEstimates of  the mean and SD for each flux parameter were derived from this \nsample set.\n\n3.2.7. Data analysis\nStatistical differences were determined using one-way analysis of  variance \n\n(ANOVA). The difference was considered statistical significant when p<0.05.\n\n3.3. Results \n\n3.3.1. Plasma metabolite and hormone levels\nTable 3.1 provides a summary of  plasma metabolite and insulin levels \n\nalong with body mass index (BMI), age and gender for all subjects. There were \nno significant differences in the plasma levels of  insulin, C peptide, cholesterol, \nHDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and FFA between healthy \ncontrol and either of  the KTx patient groups. Homeostatic model assessment \nof  insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), calculated using fasting plasma glucose and \ninsulin, showed no significant differences among all the groups studied. All \npatients treated with CsA showed significant increases in plasma creatinine and \nureic nitrogen relative to healthy controls. These observations likely reflect an \nimpairment in kidney function due to the nephrotoxic effects of  CsA (Myers et \nal. 1986). \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 3 79\nT\n\nA\nB\n\nL\nE\n\n 3.1: C\nharacteristics of the different groups studied\n\n&amp;.\n\n\t\n\n \nG\n\nroup 1 \n\nC\nontrols \n\nG\nroup 2 \n\nN\norm\n\nog lycem\nic K\n\nT\nx \n\npatients treated  w\nith C\n\nsA\n \n\nG\nroup 3 \n\nH\nype rglycem\n\nic K\nT\n\nx  \npatients treated w\n\nith C\nsA\n\n \n\nG\nender (m\n\nale/fem\nale) \n\n3/3 \n7/0 \n\n3/0 \n\nA\nge, yr \n\n39 \u00b1\n 6 \n\n45 \u00b1\n 2 \n\n58 \u00b1\n 4* # \n\nB\nM\n\nI, kg/m\n2 \n\n26.2 \u00b1\n 1.6 \n\n24.3 \u00b1\n 1.0 \n\n30.5 \u00b1\n 0.7* # \n\nG\nlucose, m\n\nM\n \n\n4.8 \u00b1\n 0.2 \n\n4.7 \u00b1\n 0.1  \n\n7.1 \u00b1\n 0.5* #\n\n# \n\nInsulin,\nU\n\ni/m\nL\n\n \n7.3 \u00b1\n\n 2.9  \n10.7 \u00b1\n\n 5.8 \n4.5 \u00b1\n\n 0.2  \n\nC\n-peptide, nM\n\n \n2.6 \u00b1\n\n 0.9 \n3.0 \u00b1\n\n 0.7  \n2.7 \u00b1\n\n 0.3 \n\nC\nholesterol, m\n\ng/dL\n \n\n189.8 \u00b1\n 14.8 \n\n217.7 \u00b1\n 16.9 \n\n209.7 \u00b1\n 18.7 \n\nH\nD\n\nL\n C\n\nholesterol,  m\ng/dL\n\n \n51.8 \u00b1\n\n 3.9  \n46.1 \u00b1\n\n 5.6  \n65.0 \u00b1\n\n 18.8 \n\nL\nD\n\nL\n C\n\nholesterol, m\ng/dL\n\n \n119.3 \u00b1\n\n 13.3 \n141.6 \u00b1\n\n 12.1 \n130.7 \u00b1\n\n 29.5 \n\nT\nriglycerides, m\n\ng/dL\n \n\n179.2 \u00b1\n 80.6 \n\n166.0 \u00b1\n 25.3 \n\n171.7 \u00b1\n 50.5 \n\nG\nlycosylated H\n\nem\noglobin, %\n\n \n5.7 \u00b1\n\n 0.2 \n5.6 \u00b1\n\n 0.2 \n7.2 \u00b1\n\n 0.4* \n\nC\nreatinine, m\n\ng/dL\n \n\n1.0 \u00b1\n 0.1 \n\n1.3 \u00b1\n 0.1*\n\n \n1.2 \u00b1\n\n 0.0* \n\nU\nreic nitrog en, m\n\ng/dL\n \n\n14.8 \u00b1\n 1.5 \n\n25.9 \u00b1\n 2.4** \n\n21.7 \u00b1\n 3.2* \n\nP\nlasm\n\na free\nfatty acids, m\n\nm\nol/L\n\n \n0.31 \u00b1\n\n 0.07 \n0.39 \u00b1\n\n 0.05 \n0.45 \u00b1\n\n 0.12 \n\nH\nO\n\nM\nA\n\n-IR\n \n\n1.7 \u00b1\n 0.7 \n\n2.2 \u00b1\n 1.2 \n\n1.4 \u00b1\n 0.2 \n\n&amp;B\niochem\n\nical param\neters corresponding to blood sam\n\nples collected after 10h-fast and FFA\n plasm\n\na levels after 12h-fast.

This indicates that the hyperglycemia in these patients was well \nestablished prior to the study. This group also had a significantly higher BMI \nand age average compared to both normoglycemic transplant patients and to the \nhealthy control group. \n\n3.3.2. 2H-enrichment distribution of  body water and urinary glucuronide\n\nSteady-state body water enrichments were 0.53% \u00b1 0.01% in the \nhyperglycemic obese KTx patients treated with CsA. This was significantly higher \nthan that of  controls, (0.43% \u00b1 0.01%, p &lt;0.01) and of  the normoglycemic \nKTx patients treated with CsA, (0.48% \u00b1 0.02%, p &lt;0.05). These results are \nconsistent with a reduction in body water and an increased body fat fraction for \nhyperglycemic posttransplant patients.\n\n2H NMR spectra of  MAG derived from acetaminophen glucuronide \ngenerated well-resolved 2H MAG resonances with the hydrogen 5 signal SNR \nranging from 20:1 to 60:1 (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.2). Both the sample mass and \nthe 2H NMR spectra derived from healthy controls were consistent with those \nrecently reported in a study of  overnight-fasted healthy controls (Jones et al. \n2006b). Enrichment of  position 2, reflecting isotope equilibration with body \nwater, was estimated to be 86% \u00b1 12% that of  body water. This indicates that \nthe exchange between hydrogen 2 of  hepatic G6P and that of  body water via \ninterconversion of  G6P and F6P was essentially complete. This is in agreement \nwith recent reports where it was found that after 5 hours of  2H\n\n2\nO incubation, \n\nplasma 2H\n2\nO and H2 were equilibrated (Jones et. al 2006). Other MAG 2H-signals \n\ncorresponding to positions 3, 4 and 5 of  glucuronide were less intense, indicating \ndilution of  2H-enrichment at these sites by G6P derived from unlabeled hepatic \nglycogen. As was previously observed with glucuronide enrichment distributions \nfrom 2H\n\n2\nO in healthy subjects and in type 1 diabetic patients, the hydrogen 4 \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 3 81\n\nand 5 positions were enriched to similar levels (Burgess et al. 2003, Jones et al. \n2006b). The ratio of  hydrogen 3 enrichment relative to hydrogen 2 (H3/H2) was \nsignificantly lower than that of  H5/H2 (0.26 \u00b1 0.02 vs. 0.47 \u00b1 0.05, p&lt;0.005 \nfor controls; and 0.45 \u00b1 0.04 vs. 0.62 \u00b1 0.03, p&lt;0.0002 for KTx patients). \nThe difference in enrichment between positions 3 and 5 could be the result \nof  incomplete exchange of 1R-dihydroxyacetone phosphate (the precursor of  \nG6P hydrogen 3) with body water deuterium via triose phosphate isomerase, \npossibly due to isotopic discrimination. If  so, then hydrogen 3 enrichment would \nsystematically underestimate the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP. \n\nIn addition, the difference in enrichment between hydrogens 3 and 5 \ncould also reflect transaldolase (TA) activity, which catalyzes the exchange of  \nthe 456 carbon fragment of  F6P with free glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Stingl \n\nFigure 3.3. 2H spectrum of  MAG derived from urinary acetaminophen glucuronide. \nMAG molecule is represented and the respective protons identified.\n\n6 . 0 5 . 5 5 . 0 4 . 5 4 . 0 ppm\n\nH\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nC\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\nH\n\nH\n\nO\n\n2\n\n1\nH\n\nO\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nH\n\nC OHH6S\n\n6R\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n82 Chapter 3\n\net al. 2006, Jones et al. 2008). Since TA exchange results in the enrichment of  \nunlabeled F6P (i.e., that derived from glycogenolysis) in positions 4, 5 and 6, this \nactivity would contribute to hydrogen 5 enrichment of  G6P independently of  \ngluconeogenic flux, whereas hydrogen 3 enrichment would not be affected.\n\n3.3.4. Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis contributions to hepatic \n            glucose production by Bayesian/MCMC analysis\n\nA summary of  the Bayesian/MCMC estimates of  the fractional \ncontributions of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to HGP for each subject \nis shown in Table 3.2, along with the SNR of  the Fourier-transformed 2H NMR \nspectrum of  MAG. Generally, the precision of  the flux estimates, as determined \nby the size of  the SD, was highest for spectra with high SNR. These results \nalso indicate that the precision of  the Bayesian analysis is related to the relative \nintensities of  the H5 and H2 signals independently of  their individual SNR. As \nseen in Table 3.2, 2H NMR spectra derived from controls and from hyperglycemic \nKTx patients had comparable SNR for H2 and H5. However, metabolic flux \noutputs from the spectra of  the KTx patients had smaller SD compared to those \nof  controls (5% \u00b1 1% vs. 7% \u00b1 2%). Aside from a higher H5/H2 intensity ratio \n(0.64 vs. 0.54), the spectra derived from the patients were similar to those of  the \ncontrol group in terms of  signal linewidths and resolution. These results suggest \nthat when the gluconeogenic contribution is low (i.e., less than 50% of  HGP), \nthe H5 signal SNR should be at least 60:1 in order to obtain reasonably low \nlevels of  uncertainty (i.e., a coefficient of  variation of  10% or less). With higher \ngluconeogenic contributions (> 65% of  HGP), a similar level of  precision can \nbe obtained from spectra with H5 SNR ratios of  only ~30:1.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 3 83\n\nTABLE 3.2: Estimates of  fractional gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis contributions \nto HGP as determined by Bayesian analysis#. \n\nSubject % HGP from \ngluconeogenesis \n\n% HGP from \nglycogenolysis \n\nH2 SNR H5 SNR \n\nGroup 1: Controls     \n\nAS 56 \u00b1 10 44 \u00b1 10 22.6 11.6 \n\nFP 55 \u00b1 8 45 \u00b1 8 66.4 33.1 \n\nIL 51 \u00b1 7 49 \u00b1 7 143.4 64.6 \n\nRC 43 \u00b1 7 57 \u00b1 7 69.7 35.7 \n\nRAC 55 \u00b1 3 45 \u00b1 3 130.9 63.5 \n\nTD 64 \u00b1 9 36 \u00b1 9 47.2 28.2 \n\nAverage \u00b1 SD  54 \u00b1 7 46 \u00b1 7 - - \n\nGroup 2: Normoglycemic KTx \npatients treated with CsA \n\n    \n\nAB 54 \u00b1 6 46 \u00b1 6 80.2 46.5 \n\nAL 55 \u00b1 6 45 \u00b1 6 71.4 30.8 \n\nAM 69 \u00b1 5 31 \u00b1 5 80.6 52.8 \n\nAR 68 \u00b1 4 32 \u00b1 4 70.0 45.6 \n\nFO 70 \u00b1 4 30 \u00b1 4 55.1 44.0 \n\nLC 60 \u00b1 5 40 \u00b1 5 158.2 96.4 \n\nLS 58 \u00b1 2 42 \u00b1 2 86.2 51.7 \n\nAverage \u00b1 SD  62 \u00b1 7 38 \u00b1 7 - - \n\nGroup 3: Hyperglycemic KTx \npatients treated with CsA \n\n    \n\nAM 69 \u00b1 5 31 \u00b1 5 30.9 22.2 \n\nAC 70 \u00b1 4 30 \u00b1 4 62.6 34.6 \n\nFS 65 \u00b1 4 35 \u00b1 4 95.2 59.6 \n\nAverage \u00b1 SD  68 \u00b1 3* 32 \u00b1 3* - - \n# Data presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of  the Bayesian posterior probabilities (SDBPP) \nfor each subject.

These \ndata are also in good agreement with values obtained by 2H NMR analysis of  \nMAG derived from urinary glucuronide (Burgess et. al 2003, Jones et al. 2006b).\n \n\n The gluconeogenic and glycogenolysis contribution to HGP for all the \npatients on CsA treatment is 64% \u00b1 7% and 36% \u00b1 7%, respectively (p&lt;0.05, \nrelative to controls).

This estimate is somewhat higher than the \nvalue of  64% determined in healthy obese subjects by the 2H\n\n2\nO method but is \n\nin excellent agreement with the value of  68% obtained from obese subjects with \ntype 2 diabetes (Gastaldelli et al. 2000) (Table 3.2 and Figure 3.4). There was no \nsignificant relationship between the fractional contribution of  gluconeogenesis \nand any of  the reported clinical parameters.\n\n3.4. Discussion\n\nThe reported work demonstrates the feasibility and some limitations for \nquantifying fractional gluconeogenesis from Landau\u00b4s 2H\n\n2\nO method by Bayesian \n\ntime-domain analysis of  glucuronide enrichment in positions 5 and 2. As a result \nof  the relatively large sample mass provided by glucuronide harvesting, 2H NMR \nspectra with high SNR were obtained with a standard 11.75 T spectrometer and \na 5 mm broadband probe. The accuracy precision of  the Bayesian analysis is \nlargely dependent on the SNR of  the 2H NMR spectrum. Among other things, \nthis is a valuable tool for objectively determining the relationship between the \nsample collection time and statistical power of  the analysis. \n\nFrom the patient\u00b4s perspective, urinary glucuronide analysis is a more \nconvenient and less invasive alternative to blood sampling. In addition, urinary \nglucuronide is far less susceptible than plasma glucose to degradation from \ndelayed processing or storage above -80\u00b0C. Plasma glucose storage at -20\u00b0C for \nmore than one month results in a marked decrease in glucose recovery as MAG \nwhereas urinary glucuronide is stable for at least 4 months under these conditions. \nHowever, there are several disadvantages of  acetaminophen glucuronide analysis \ncompared to that of  plasma glucose. The derivatization of  acetaminophen \nglucuronide to MAG involves several additional steps compared to that of  \n\n\n\n86 Chapter 3\n\nplasma glucose and is therefore far less amenable for routine automation. In \nprinciple, the Bayesian analysis could be applied to 2H NMR data of  alternative \nglucuronides such as menthol glucuronide which can be more easily purified \nfrom urine and has fully resolved glucuronide 2H-signals in its original form \n(Ribeiro et al. 2005, Mendes et al. 2006). \n\nCompared to plasma glucose, the analysis of  glucuronide 2H-enrichment \nis less informative since the hexose position 6 hydrogens are removed during \nthe conversion of  UDP-glucose to glucuronide. The absence of  position 6 \n2H-enrichment  information means that the contributions of  the TCA cycle \nand glycerol to gluconeogenesis, which relies on quantifying 2H-enrichment in \nboth position 5 and 6 (Landau et al. 1996), is not resolved. Gluconeogenesis \nmeasurement cannot be performed if  there are contraindications to \nacetaminophen, such as advanced cirrhosis, or if  the subject is inherently \nunable to synthesize significant levels of  glucuronide, such as patients with \nuridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase deficiency (Demorais et al. \n1992). There is additional uncertainty in the glucuronide sampling interval due \nto a 30-to 60-min lag time from its hepatic site of  formation to reaching the \nbladder (Hellerstein et al. 1987). Moreover, hepatic glucuronide and glucose may \nexhibit different enrichment patterns from certain tracers as a result of  hepatic \nmetabolic zonation (Ekberg et al. 1995). Glycogen metabolism and glucuronide \nsynthesis are both located in the pericentral region of  the hepatic lobule whereas \nglucose secretion is predominantly in the periportal region (Jungermann 1986, \nJungermann and Thurman 1992). To the extent that there is a difference in \nthe gluconeogenic contribution to G6P synthesis in periportal vs. pericentral \nhepatocytes, plasma glucose and urinary glucuronide could report different \nfractional contributions of  gluconeogenesis to HGP. For a small group of  \nhealthy subjects, plasma glucose and urinary glucuronide provided equivalent \nestimates of  gluconeogenesis (Burgess et al. 2003), but this has not been tested in \nlarger subject populations or in patients with disorders of  glucose metabolism.\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 3 87\n\nThe results described in here suggest that the gluconeogenic contribution \nto HGP had a tendency to be modestly higher in lean normoglycemic KTx \npatients undergoing CsA-based immunosuppressant therapy compared to \nhealthy controls, but this difference did not reach statistical significance in \nthis study. Substrate selection for HGP can be modified by changes in insulin \naction as well as by the availability of  oxidizable substrates such as FFA. Hepatic \nglycogenolysis is suppressed by insulin and enhanced by glucagon and is therefore \nsensitive to alterations in plasma insulin levels (Surmely et al. 1999). FFA can \nstimulate gluconeogenesis, possibly via augmentation of  hepatic adenosine \ntriphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) \nproduction (Chen et al. 1999, Boden et al. 2002). They may also increase the rate \nof  glycogenolysis by impairing its suppression by insulin (Boden et al. 2002). \nWhile CsA has been reported to reduce pancreatic insulin secretion (Hjelmesaeth \net al. 2007) possibly by inducing pancreatic ?-cells apoptosis (Penfornis and \nKury-Paulin 2006), neither the normo- nor the hyperglycemic CsA patients of  \nthis study had significantly different plasma insulin levels compared to healthy \ncontrols, at least under basal fasting conditions. Therefore, the data reported \nin here suggests that the observed alterations in HGP sources are not due to \ndefective insulin secretion during fasting. Moreover, HOMA-IR indices for the \nthree subject groups were similar suggesting that insulin sensitivity, as determined \nby this method, was not significantly modified in KTx patients. While plasma \nFFA levels were not significantly different between healthy, lean/normoglycemic \nand obese/hyperglycemic KTx patients, there was a tendency for FFA levels \nto be higher in the KTx patients, with the highest values found in the obese \ngroup.\n\n\n\n88 Chapter 3\n\n3.5. Conclusions\n\nIn summary, for KTx patients undergoing CsA immunosuppressant \ntherapy, the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP is significantly increased in the \nsetting of  PTDM. This metabolic alteration is most strongly associated with \nadiposity and BMI, but may also be associated with elevated plasma FFA. There \nwas no association between the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP and either \nfasting plasma insulin levels or insulin sensitivity as determined by HOMA-IR. \nCsA treatment per se appears to provoke only modest alterations of  HGP sources \nand is not associated with fasting hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia. Finally, \nthe Bayesian analysis of  urinary glucuronide 2H-enrichment allows an objective \nevaluation of  hepatic HGP sources to be easily integrated with other simple and \npractical measurements of  human glucose homeostasis. \n\n3.6.

Introduction\n\n Hepatic glucose metabolism plays an important role in whole body \nglucose homeostasis. In fasting, the liver accounts for the bulk of  endogenous \nglucose production with glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis both contributing \nto hepatic glucose production (HGP). After an overnight-fast gluconeogenesis \nand glycogenolsysis contribute equally to HGP whereas with increased fasting, \nhepatic glycogen stores are depleted and gluconeogenesis contribution is \nenhanced (Rothman et al. 1991, Landau et al. 1996).\n During absorption of  a meal, the liver receives a relatively high \nconcentration of  glucose via the portal vein. The increased glucose levels per se \nactivate glucokinase to phosphorylate hepatic glucose to glucose-6-phosphate \n(G6P). The elevated G6P concentrations have a synergistic effect with glucose \nin promoting the inactivation of  glycogen phosphorylase and inducing glycogen \nsynthesis through glycogen synthase activation. Moreover, the increased glucose \nlevels stimulate insulin secretion by pancreatic b-cells. Insulin further activates \nglucokinase by promoting its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm \nwhereas elevated plasma insulin to glucagon ratio activate glycogen synthase, \ninhibit glycogen phosphorylase and are also responsible for inactivation of  some \nkey gluconeogenic regulatory enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate kinase \n(PEPCK). Overall, hyperinsulinemia promotes hepatic glucose uptake, storage \nas glycogen, and suppression of  HGP. After a glucose load, ~20% of  the glucose \nis cleared by the liver and deposited as glycogen (Petersen et al. 2001).\n In addition, glucose and insulin stimulate glucose uptake by insulin-\nsensitive peripheral tissues, including skeletal muscle and adipocytes. Hence, \nthrough the reduction of  HGP and an increase in glucose disposal, plasma glucose \nlevels are quickly restored to normal limits following carbohydrate ingestion and \nabsorption. A defect in one or both of  these mechanisms reduces the capacity \nfor glucose homeostasis under these conditions and forms the definition of  \n\n\n\n96 Chapter 4\n\nglucose intolerance. In the clinical setting, glucose intolerance is interrogated by a \nglucose tolerance test (GTT). In humans, glucose can be administrated by means \nof  an intravenous (i.v.) infusion, the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), \nincluded in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or in the carbohydrate \ncomponent of  a mixed meal ingestion test. In small animal models, such as rats \nand mice, glucose intolerance may be assessed by IVGTT and OGTT protocols \nbut the glucose load is also often delivered as an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, \ni.p. glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), because this method is more convenient \ncompared to the other administration procedures.   \n In its current form, a glucose tolerance test can identify a defined level of  \nglucose intolerance, but does not identify or resolve the underlying causes, which \nmay include impaired glucose clearance, impaired suppression of  HGP, or both. \nBy introducing tracers into the load and analyzing their entry and clearance into \nplasma glucose and hepatic glycogen, the hepatic and peripheral components of  \nglucose homeostasis can be resolved. \n In this study, the fate of  an i.p. glucose load enriched with [U-13C]glucose \nand deuterated water (2H\n\n2\nO) was studied. Entry and clearance of  the load \n\nthrough plasma glucose and the effects of  the load on HGP were assessed by \nthe analysis of  plasma glucose enrichment from both tracers. This measurement \nwas applied to Sprague-Dawley rats fasted for 6 hours. From the perspective of  \nhepatic glucose metabolism, this fasting period corresponds to that of  overnight-\nfasting in humans, the standard starting point for a glucose tolerance test in the \nclinical setting. The contribution of  HGP to total body glucose was determined \nfrom the deuterium (2H)-enrichment of  plasma glucose position 2 relative to \nthat of  plasma water (PW) (Allick et al. 2006). The fraction of  plasma glucose \nderived from gluconeogenic sources was quantified from the 2H-enrichment \nlevels at position 5 of  plasma glucose relative to that of  PW. The contribution \nof  the i.p. load to plasma and total body glucose was estimated from the carbon \n13 (13C)-enrichment level of  plasma [U-13C]glucose relative to that of  the load. \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 4 97\n\nEnrichments of  plasma glucose by [U-13C]glucose and 2H\n2\nO were resolved by \n\n2H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. \n These measurements were applied to a group of  healthy animals fed \nwith a standard chow (SC) diet to obtain baseline estimates of  glucose kinetics. \nTo investigate the changes in glucose kinetics that accompany the onset of  \nglucose intolerance induced by dietary or by pharmacological interventions, \ntwo further groups of  animals were studied. In one group, glucose intolerance \nwas induced as a result of  high fat (HF) diet feeding. Previous studies have \nshown that rats placed on a HF diet show normal fasting blood glucose but \nwhen challenged with a glucose load they reveal glucose intolerance secondary \nto insulin resistance (Kraegen et al. 1986, Storlien et al. 1986). The underlying flux \nmechanisms that contribute to glucose intolerance have not yet been defined \nin this model. In the other group, glucose intolerance in normally-fed animals \nwas induced after administration of  Cyclosporine A (CsA). CsA is currently the \nmost widely used agent for suppressing the host immune response following \nsolid organ transplantation. It has recently been implicated in the promotion of  \nglucose intolerance and posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM), mainly through \ndisruption of  pancreatic b-cell function in vivo (Doyle et al. 2003). The effect of  \nCsA on glucose clearance and HGP fluxes in relation to the development of  \nglucose intolerance is not known.\n\n4.2. Materials and Methods\n\n4.2.1. Materials \n\n [U-13C]glucose (99%) and 2H\n2\nO (99.9%) were obtained from Cambridge \n\nIsotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). CsA and other common \nchemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The HF diet used contained \n45% of  calories from fat, 35% from carbohydrate and 20% derived from protein \n\n\n\n98 Chapter 4\n\n(E15744-34, SSNIFF, Specialdi\u00e4ten GmbH)\u00ae. SC diet contains 2.7% of  fat, 60% \ncarbohydrate and 16% protein.\n\n4.2.2. Treatment protocol   \n The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use \nCommittee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in a room on a 12-h light-\ndark cycle under constant temperature (22-25 \u00baC) and with ad libitum access to \nfood and water. Animals were separated into different groups: Group 1, control \nanimals maintained on a SC diet for 20 days; Group 2, animals maintained for 20 \ndays on a HF diet; and Group 3, rats maintained on a SC diet and given daily an \ni.p. injection of  CsA (15 mg/kg body weight). This dose was chosen according \nto previous studies in literature (Mazzoni et al. 1986). At the day of  the study, \nall groups of  animals were matched for body weight (Group 1, 318 \u00b1 13 g; \nGroup 2, 324 \u00b1 20 g; Group 3, 313 \u00b1 18 g). The number of  animals for each \nexperiment is indicated in the legend of  the figures.\n\n4.2.3. Intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test protocol (IPGTT)\n\n After 6-h fasting, rats were challenged with an i.p. glucose load (1.5 mg \nglucose/g body weight) 9.6 % enriched with [U-13C]glucose and dissolved in \n4 mL of  70% 2H\n\n2\nO-saline. After the i.p. glucose load, control animals were \n\nsacrificed at different time points during a 60 min period. Animals on a HF diet \nor treated with CsA were sacrificed after 60 min and compared to the respective \ncontrols. At the pre-defined intervals, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane \nanesthetic, blood was immediately withdrawn from the descending aorta and the \nliver weighted, freeze-clamped and kept at -80\u00baC until further analysis. Blood \nglucose and plasma insulin levels were assessed using a standard glucometer and \nan ELISA kit from Lynco, respectively.\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 4 99\n\n4.2.4. Blood processing\n\n Blood was immediately deproteinized with a final volume of  4% \nperchloric acid (70%) and centrifuged at 13,000 g at 4\u00baC for plasma separation. \nThe plasma supernatant was separated from erythrocytes and neutralized with \nconcentrated KOH. Samples were further purified by anionic-cationic exchange \nchromatography and evaporated to dryness. The conversion of  plasma glucose \nto monoacetone glucose (MAG) was performed according to the literature \n(Jones et al. 2001). \n\n4.2.5. Liver Processing\n\n Frozen livers were freeze-dried and then powdered. 30% KOH at 70\u00baC \nwas added to each sample in 2:1 (v/v). After 30 minutes, 8 mL of  Na\n\n2\nSO\n\n4 \n\n6% and 50 mL of  absolute ethanol were added and the sample incubated \novernight at 4\u00baC. The precipitated glycogen was separated from the supernatant \nby centrifugation at 3,000 g and dissolved in 5 mL of  acetate buffer 0.05 M \n(pH 4.5). 16 U of  amyloglucosidase were added to each sample and incubated \nfor 10 hours at 55\u00baC. The containing glucose supernatant was then separated \nby centrifugation and derivatized to MAG according to literature (Jones et al. \n2001).\n\n4.2.6. Conversion of  glucose to monoacetone glucose\n\n A mixture of  0.5 mL acetone/mL of  original plasma or 20 mL acetone/\nliver and concentrated anhydrous H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4 \n(40 mL/mL acetone) was added to \n\nthe sample and stirred vigorously for 4 h. 10 mL of  H\n2\nO were added and the \n\npH adjusted to 2.2-2.3 followed by incubation at 40 \u00baC for 5 h. The samples \npH was adjusted to ~8.0 and then evaporated to dryness. The dry residue was \nfurther extracted using ethyl acetate. MAG samples were then stored at room \ntemperature until NMR analysis. MAG reflects plasma glucose and hepatic \n\n\n\n100 Chapter 4\n\nglycogen glucose monomers labeling patterns but with completely resolved 2H \nand 13C NMR signals.\n\n4.2.7. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy \n 4.2.7.1. 2H NMR Spectroscopy\n\n 2H NMR spectra from plasma MAG pooled samples and MAG from \nhepatic glycogen glucose monomers were obtained using a Varian 14.1 Tesla (T) \nspectrometer (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA). MAG was dissolved in \n90% acetonitrile/10% water and shimming was performed on selected MAG \nproton (1H) resonances. 1H-decoupled 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 50\u00baC \nusing a 90\u00ba pulse, a 1.5 s acquisition time and 0.1 s interpulse delay. Typically \n6,000-20,000 scans were averaged. For the determination of  PW 2H-enrichment, \nusing the method described in Jones et al., spectra were obtained at 25\u00baC using a \n22.5\u00ba pulse and a 4 s acquisition time  (Jones et al. 2001). \n\n 4.2.7.2. 13C NMR Spectroscopy \n Samples were dissolved in deuterated acetonitrile for 13C NMR analysis. \n1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian 11.75 T system \n(Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a 5-mm broadband \nprobe. Spectra were acquired at 25\u00baC using a 90\u00ba pulse and a 2.5 s acquisition \ntime. 4,000-10,000 scans were averaged for each spectrum.  \n\n 4.2.7.3. NMR Analysis\n\n 2H and 13C NMR spectra were analyzed using the curve-fitting routine \nsupplied with the NUTS PC-based NMR spectral analysis program (Acorn NMR \nInc., Fremont CA). In the MAG samples derived from the glucose monomers \nof  hepatic glycogen, 2H-enrichments were determined by comparison with the \n2H natural abundance (0.015%) signals of  the acetone group of  MAG whereas \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 4 101\n\nin MAG samples from plasma glucose, 2H-enrichments were quantified relative \nto an internal standard of  dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). 13C-enrichments were \ndetermined relative to the natural abundance C1 singlet (1.11%).\n\n4.2.8. Glucose from HGP and gluconeogenesis contribution \n After the glucose load, it is assumed that total body glucose represents \na combination of  glucose absorbed from the load, HGP, and existent glucose \nfrom before the load (Jin et al. 2003). After providing 2H\n\n2\nO, plasma glucose \n\nderived from HGP has 2H incorporated into position 2 as a result of  exchange \nbetween hepatic G6P and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). Hence, the ratio of  2H-\nenrichment in position 2 of  glucose (H2) to that of  PW reflects the fractional \ncontribution of  HGP to plasma glucose (Eq. 4.1). Note that this contribution \nformally includes glucose molecules that undergo futile cycling between blood \nand liver as a result of  glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activites \n(Katz et al. 1975). 2H-enrichment in position 2 of  glucose was quantified by \n2H NMR analysis of  the MAG derivative of  plama glucose (Figure 4.1). MAG \nsamples from animals of  the same group at same time post-load were pooled in \norder to obtain better quality 2H NMR spectra for confident quantification of  \nthe 2H positional enrichments. \n Plasma glucose derived from gluconeogenesis has deuterium incorporated \nin position 5 as a result of  exchanges at the level of  the triose phosphate \nprecursors. The fraction of  plasma glucose derived from gluconeogenesis can \nthus be determined from the ratio of  2H-enrichment in position 5 of  plasma \nglucose (H5) relative to the plasma water 2H-enrichment (Eq. 4.2). \n\nPercent of  plasma glucose from HGP = (H2/PW) \u00d7 100 (%)                         [Eq. 4.1]\n\nPercent of  plasma glucose from gluconeogenesis = (H5/PW) \u00d7 100 (%)        [Eq. 4.2]\n\n\n\n102 Chapter 4\n\nFigure 4.1. 2H NMR spectrum of  monoacetone glucose (MAG) derived from plasma \nglucose. The 2H NMR spectrum shown corresponds to pooled MAG samples from control \nanimals, 60 min after the i.p. glucose load (1.5 mg/g body weight) and administration of  \n2H\n\n2\nO. Seven MAG aliphatic hydrogens derived from plasma glucose are shown and identified \n\nrespectively.\n\n4.2.9. Glucose and \u201crecycled\u201d glucose from the i.p. load     \n The contribution to total glucose from the i.p. load was estimated using \n13C NMR analysis following administration of  [U-13C]glucose. As the glucose \nload was only 9.6 % enriched with [U-13C]glucose, the probability that two [U-\n13C]trioses can be recombined to form [U-13C]glucose is very low. Thus, it is \nassumed that all [U-13C]glucose present in plasma glucose originated from the \nload (Jin et al. 2003). In the 13C NMR spectra of  MAG derived from plasma \nglucose, the 13C resonances consist of  singlet signals, mostly derived from \n13C natural-abundance, and the 13C-13C spin-spin coupled multiplets. In the \ncarbon 1 resonance, it is possible to resolve the quartet (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4) \ncorresponding to [U-13C]glucose that is quantified relative to the 1.11% natural \nabundance singlet (Figure 4.2). \n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nH\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nC\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\nH\n\nH\n\nO\n\n2\n\n1\nH\n\nO\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nH\n\nC OHH6S\n\n6R\n6R 6S\n\n6.0 5.5 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 ppm\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 4 103\n\nFigure 4.2.

The singlet \n(S) corresponding to the natural abundance and the isotopomers resultant of  [U-13C]glucose \n(Q1-Q4) and recycled glucose (D1 and D2) are observed. \n\n By accounting for the 9.6 % [U-13C]glucose enrichment of  the i.p. glucose \nload it is possible to estimate the contribution of  the i.p. load to plasma glucose \nas follows:\n\nContribution to glucose from i.p. load = \n\n[(Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4) / S] \u00d7 1.11 / 0.096 (%)                  [Eq. 4.3]\n\n The doublet signals (D1 and D2) in the 13C NMR carbon 1 multiplet \ndue to 13C-13C coupling between carbons 1 and 2 (but not carbon 5) represent \nthe sum of  [1,2,3-13C\n\n3\n]glucose and [1,2-13C\n\n2\n]glucose isotopomers. These \n\nrepresent \u201crecycled\u201d glucose molecules formed through the activity of  the Cori \ncycle (i.e., glucose?pyruvate/lactate?glucose) since they are assumed to be \nderived from [1,2,3-13C\n\n3\n]pyruvate, the glycolytic product of  [U-13C]glucose.

The abundance of  these two \nisotopomers, corrected for dilution at the level of  the TCA cycle, provides an \nestimate of  the fraction of  plasma glucose derived from recycling (Perdigoto et \nal. 2003, Sena et al. 2007) as follows:\n\nContribution of  recycled glucose from i.p. load=\n\n[(D1 + D2) / S] \u00d7 1.11 / 0.096 \u00d7 1.5 (%)                                [Eq. 4.4]\n\nwhere 1.5 is a correction factor that accounts for dilution of  the 13C-label at the \nlevel of  the hepatic TCA cycle (Perdigoto et al. 2003, Sena et al. 2007).\n\n  Previous studies have shown that the glucose entering the system is \ninstantaneously mixed in ~16-20% of  the animal body weight, the glucose mixing \nspace (mL/kg) (Baker et al. 1959, Raman et al. 1990, McArthur et al. 1999). Using \nEq. 4.5 is possible to determine the total body glucose considering the total \nglucose space, animals\u2019 body weight and the blood glucose concentration.\n\nTotal body glucose = glucose space \u00d7 [blood glucose] \u00d7 animal body weight  [Eq. 4.5]\n\n Thus, the absolute contributions (mmol) of  HGP, gluconeogenesis,  \nglucose and \u201crecycled\u201d glucose from the i.p. load to total body glucose are \nderived by multiplying relative percent contributions by total body glucose at \neach time point.\n \n4.2.10. Hepatic glycogen synthesis\n\n Hepatic glycogen content was determined 60 min following the i.p. \nglucose load by analyzing the amount of  glucose after enzymatic hydrolysis of  \nhepatic glycogen. Glucose concentrations were assessed enzymatically by the \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 4 105\n\nglucose oxidase method using a commercial kit (Invitrogen). The percentage \nof  newly synthesized hepatic glycogen after the glucose load can be quantified \nby analyzing the 2H-enrichment in position 2 of  MAG derivatized from hepatic \nglycogen following its enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose. Indirect pathway \ncontributions to hepatic glycogen synthesis can be further assessed by calculating \nthe ratio of  2H-enrichments in position 5 and 2.\n\n 4.2.11. Statistical analysis\n\n Data are presented as average \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Statistical \ndifferences were determined using one-way analysis of  variance (ANOVA) and \nconsidered to be statistical significant when p &lt;0.05.\n\n4.3. Results\n\n4.3.1. Blood glucose and plasma insulin during an i.p. glucose load \n Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels attained during the i.p. glucose \nload for the groups studied are shown in Figure 4.3. Blood glucose peaked 15 \nmin after the glucose load for control animals and decreased gradually thereafter, \nreturning to basal levels 60 min after the load. The relatively high blood glucose \nlevels attained may be partially attributed to the known effects of  the anesthesia \n(Zuurbier et al. 2008). CsA-treated animals show significant elevated fasting \nhyperglycemia relative to control animals. HF diet and especially CsA treatment \npromoted impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) as compared with healthy animals. \nIn addition, there is a trend for decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in \nCsA-treated animals. \n\n\n\n106 Chapter 4\n\nFigure 4.3.

The \nobserved plasma [U-13C]enrichment levels correspond to a ~37% contribution \nfrom the i.p. glucose load. Low plasma [U-13C]glucose enrichments could result \nfrom reduced absorption rate of  the i.p. glucose load or from dilution from \nunlabeled glucose generated via HGP. Previous studies with oral glucose loads \nshow that 50% of  plasma glucose in 6-h fasted rats was accounted for by the \nload at 60 minutes after (Smadja et al. 1988) while in 24-h fasted rats, the load \ncontribution was 70-80% (Jin et al. 2003). Thus, the reduced contribution of  the \nload glucose in the 6-h compared to 24-h fasting most probably reflects a higher \ninitial glucose pool size and/or increased HGP at 6-h vs. 24-h fasting.\n\nFigure 4.5.

Glucose from HGP and gluconeogenesis contribution\n\n All plasma glucose derived from HGP (gluconeogenesis + glycogenolysis \n+  glucose-G6P cycling) is labeled in position 2 as a result of  F6P-G6P exchange. \nIf  HGP accounted for all the plasma glucose, the plasma glucose H2 enrichment \nlevel would be equal to that of  PW. The glucose contributions from HGP to \ntotal glucose with time are shown in Figure 4.6. For control animals, HGP \ncontributions were relatively constant and significant between 15 and 60 min \nafter the i.p. glucose load.\n Gluconeogenesis results in the labeling of  H5 as well as H2 (while \nglycogenolysis and glucose-G6P cycling do not). Hence the fraction of  plasma \nglucose derived from gluconeogenesis is given by H5/PW. If  all plasma glucose \nwas derived from gluconeogenesis, then the plasma glucose H5 enrichment level \nwould be equal to that of  PW. It would also necessarily mean that all HGP was \nderived from gluconeogenesis (i.e., H5/H2 = 1.0) and that all plasma glucose \nwas derived from HGP since H5/H2 = 1.0, therefore H2 = PW (see Figure \n4.1). From 15-60 minutes after the glucose load, gluconeogenesis was found to \naccount for a minority (30-45%) of  HGP.\n\n4.3.4. Glucose and \u201crecycled\u201d glucose from the i.p. load\n\n From the 13C NMR analysis of  plasma glucose 13C-isotopomer levels, \ndirect plasma glucose enrichment from the i.p. load, as determined from the \nenrichment of  plasma [U-13C]glucose, reached a peak at 30 min. At this point, \n37% of  total plasma and body glucose was accounted for by direct absorption \nfrom the load. At 60 min after the glucose load, direct absorption accounted \nfor 34% of  the load while HGP accounted for 55% of  plasma glucose. The \nremaining 11% may represent the presence of  a small amount of  unlabeled \nglucose from before the load.\n At 60 min post-load, \u201crecycled\u201d glucose accounted for 107 \u00b1 35 mmol \nof  total glucose and ~89% of  the gluconeogenic HGP component. These data \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 4 109\n\nsuggest that during the i.p. glucose load, glucose recycling via the Cori cycle \nquantitatively accounts for almost all of  the gluconeogenesis contribution \nto HGP. Thus, the glucose recycling fraction provides a good estimate of  \ngluconeogenesis in this specific instance and in principle, would allow both \nthe absorption and gluconeogenic contributions to plasma glucose levels to be \ndetermined from a single [U-13C]glucose tracer. \n\nFigure 4.6.

Effects  of   HF  diet  and  CsA  treatment in postprandial glucose\n            metabolism\n\n Postprandial metabolism of  rats on a HF diet or CsA treatment for 20 \ndays was further assessed during an i.p. glucose load test using 2H and 13C NMR \nspectroscopy following 2H\n\n2\nO and [U-13C]glucose administration. Animals on a \n\nHF diet presented normal HGP, whereas CsA treated animals showed increased \nHGP and an increased contribution of  the i.p. load to total glucose (Figure 4.7). \nTotal body glucose and contributions from \u201crecycled\u201d glucose from load were \nnot significantly altered in HF diet-fed and CsA-treated rats.\n\n4.3.6. Hepatic glycogen synthesis\n\n Hepatic glycogen content was assessed 60 min after the i.p. glucose load \nand found to account for 0.44 \u00b1 0.13 mmol/g of  liver wet weight in control \nanimals. Hepatic glycogen content is not significantly altered in animals on a \nHF diet (0.37 \u00b1 0.19 mmol/g liver wet weight) and CsA treatment (0.39 \u00b1 0.09 \nmmol/g liver wet weight). Moreover, hepatic glycogen content was previously \ndetermined in healthy animals after 6-h fasting and found to account for 0.35 \u00b1 \n0.10 mmol/g liver wet weight (Chapter 2). Thus, in 6-h fasted animals, hepatic \nglycogen content is not significantly altered after a glucose load which is in \nagreement with earlier studies (Smadja et al. 1988). Moreover, hepatic glycogen \nsynthesis was quantified by measuring the incorporation of  deuterium in hepatic \nglycogen and found to account only for ~2.5 % of  total hepatic glycogen  in \ncontrol animals (~1 mmol/g liver during 60 min, data not shown). In these rats, \nindirect pathway contributed for  ~64% of  hepatic glycogen synthesis (data not \nshown). \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 4 111\n\nFigure 4.7. A.

At 24 hours of  fasting, the continuation of  HGP \nin the presence of  a glucose load may be an appropriate response to restore \ndepleted carbohydrate stores in peripheral tissues. \n To the extent that HGP as measured by the deuterated water method  \nused in here includes contributions from glucose-G6P futile cycling, the true \nrates of  HGP are overestimated. In hepatocytes, it was shown that futile cycling \nbetween glucose and G6P is extensive when glycogen content is elevated (i.e., \nfed animals) and relatively low in cells from starved rats (Katz et al. 1975). \nConsidering that 6-h fasted animals demonstrated substantial G6Pase activity \n(as seen by the substantial contribution of  HGP to whole body glucose) in the \nface of  a large glucose load (which should stimulate glucokinase as a result of  \nincreased insulin levels), glucose-G6P cycling could be very active under these \nconditions and may contribute substantially to the estimated HGP. \n Gluconeogenesis contribution to total glucose after a glucose load was \ndetermined by measuring the ratio of  H5 to PW following administration of  2H\n\n2\nO \n\nand found to account for 30-45% of  total glucose production. Previously, in 6-h \nfasted rats, gluconeogenesis was found to account for ~54% of  HGP (Chapter \n2). The observation that HGP sources are not drastically altered as a result of  a \nglucose load is in agreement with previous studies where gluconeogenesis was \nfound to account for ~80% of  HGP in 24-h fasted rats, before (Jin et al. 2004) \nand after a glucose load (Jin et al. 2003). Moreover, the glucose-G6P cycling \nactivity may also explain the relatively low gluconeogenic contribution (30-45%) \nto HGP that was measured. \n Given the abundance of  hepatic glycogen after 6 hours of  fasting (~0.35 \nmmol/g liver wet weight) (Chapter 2) contributions from glycogenolysis to HGP \ncannot be ruled out. However, the fact that hepatic glycogen levels at 60 minutes \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 4 113\n\npost-load were essentially equal to baseline levels indicates that there was no \nnet loss or gain of  hepatic glycogen as a result of  the glucose load. In addition, \n2H incorporation into newly synthesized hepatic glycogen was residual implying \nthat after a glucose load, hepatic glycogen synthesis is negligible in 6-h fasted \nrats. This is in agreement with a study by Smadja et al., where liver glycogen \nconcentration remained unchanged during the glucose load despite a normal \ncapacity for glycogen synthesis (Smadja et al. 1988). \n The contribution of  plasma glucose from the i.p. load as estimated using \n13C NMR analysis following administration of  [U-13C]glucose was found to \ncontribute ~34% for total glucose, 60 minutes after the glucose load. The reduced \ncontribution of  the load glucose in 6-h fasted rats most probably reflects a high \ninitial glucose pool size and/or increased HGP. \u201cRecycled\u201d glucose from Cori \ncycle contribution was determined and found to be similar to the gluconeogenesis \ncontribution to total glucose. Thus, lactate from \u201crecycled\u201d glucose through \nCori cycle in peripheral tissues is probably the major gluconeogenic substrate \nfollowing a glucose load (Niewoehner et al. 1984). The glucose recycling fraction \nprovides a good estimate of  gluconeogenesis and in principle allows both the \nabsorption and gluconeogenic contributions to plasma glucose levels to be \ndetermined from a single [U-13C]glucose tracer. \n Finally, sources of  total glucose after an i.p. glucose load were evaluated \nin animals on a HF diet for 20 days and with ongoing CsA treatment. Both \ngroups of  animals showed IGT relative to controls. HF diet did not promote \nimpaired contribution from HGP and insulin secretion by pancreatic b-cells was \nnot affected. Thus, the IGT of  HF-fed animals can be attributed to decreased \nwhole body glucose disposal secondary to peripheral insulin resistance rather than \nimpaired HGP suppression. With CsA-treated animals the observed IGT was \nassociated with a higher HGP contribution to plasma glucose levels, suggesting \nthat in this model impaired HGP suppression was a significant component of  \nIGT.\n\n\n\n114 Chapter 4\n\n4.5.

Introduction\n\nThe high fat (HF) level of  the typical western style diet is considered to \nbe an important factor in the development of  type 2 diabetes (T2D) (McGarry \n2001, Unger and Zhou 2001, Unger and Orci 2001). In this setting, there is an \ninitial phase often referred to as the \u201cprediabetic state\u201d which is characterized \nby weight gain, an increase in the body fat fraction and the development of  \nglucose intolerance. In addition to an overall gain in body fat, there is increased \ndeposition of  ectopic triglycerides, particularly in liver and skeletal muscle. Since \nthese lipid pools may play a key role in the development of  insulin resistance (IR) \nat an early and possibly reversible stage of  T2D, there is an increased interest \nin the study of  ectopic lipid dynamics both in order to better understand the \npathogenesis of  IR and also as a clinical marker for identifying people that may \nbe at an elevated risk of  developing T2D. There is particular focus on the study \nof  ectopic hepatic triglycerides (HTG) as they are highly sensitive to dietary fat \nintake. Moreover,  elevated HTG is tightly associated with glucose intolerance \nand decreased insulin sensitivity (Ryysi et al. 2000, Anderwald et al. 2002). \nElevated HTG levels are prevalent in patients with established T2D (Ryysi et \nal. 2000, Anderwald et al. 2002, Mayerson et al. 2002, Kelley et al. 2003, Petersen \net al. 2005), in animal models of  T2D and are associated with features of  the \nmetabolic syndrome (Kotronen et al. 2008). \n\nRodent models are important for understanding the relationship between \nHTG and the development of  IR and glucose intolerance in the \u201cprediabetic\u201d \nstate. These models enable the design of  prospective diet studies on HTG \nlevels with the effects being observed within a few days or weeks. Non-diabetic \nhealthy rats placed on a HF diet accumulate HTG (Samuel et al. 2004,  Gauthier \net al. 2006) and this is associated with significantly impaired insulin action, \nreduced whole body glucose disposal rates and hepatic IR (Kraegen et al. 1986, \nStorlien et al. 1986, Kraegen et al. 1991, Oakes et al. 1997a, Oakes et al. 1997b). \n\n\n\n144 Chapter 6\n\nHowever, the time-scale and reversibility of  HTG levels induced by HF diet \nand its associated effects on glucose homeostasis are not as well defined in rats \ncompared to humans. This is because noninvasive methods such as Magnetic \nResonance Spectroscopy (MRS)/Imaging (MRI) that have been developed and \napplied for monitoring longitudinal changes of  human HTG levels have not \nyet been widely applied in rats. Localized proton (1H) MRS is a noninvasive \ntechnique that has been shown to be a precise tool for quantification of  HTG \ncontent (Szczepaniak et al. 1999, Szczepaniak et al. 2005, Thomas et al. 2005). \nWith appropriate high-field Magnetic Resonance (MR) systems (7 Tesla (T) or \nabove) was possible the quantification of  HTG in mice (Garbow et al. 2004) and \nin the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, a model of  T2D (Kuhlmann et al. 2003). \nAdditionally, this measurement is well suited for longitudinal measurements of  \nHTG in a single animal.\n\n HTG can be derived from extra-hepatic fatty acids that are taken up \nand esterified to triglycerides following hepatic uptake or can also be formed \nin situ via hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) of  fatty acids from acetyl-CoA. \nGiven the capacity of  the liver to synthesize, import and export triglycerides, \nthe accumulation of  HTG may arise through an imbalance between triglyceride \nimport and export and/or imbalance between triglyceride synthesis and utilization. \nIn this study, total HTG were quantified by in vivo localized proton (1H) MRS \nmeasurement and the lipogenic and non-lipogenic contributions resolved by \nintegrating the MRS measurement with a novel and simple measurement of  \nDNL by ex vivo deuterium (2H) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of  \nHTG 2H-enrichment from 2H-enriched body water. This approach was applied \nto study the effects of  altering dietary fat content on both HTG levels and \nsources in healthy male Sprague Dawley rats.\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 6 145\n\n6.2. Materials and methods\n\n6.2.1. Experimental design\n\n Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-220 g) were housed in a room on a 12-h \nlight-dark cycle (08:00-20:00 h light) under constant temperature (22-25 \u00baC) and \nwith ad libitum access to food and water. Animals were divided in three distinct \nstudy groups. In study 1, animals were studied during 20 days and divided in two \ndifferent subgroups fed either with a HF diet (n=5) containing 45% of  calories \nfrom fat, 35% from carbohydrate and 20% derived from protein (E15744-34, \nSSNIFF, Specialdi\u00e4ten GmbH)\u00ae or with a standard chow (SC) diet (2.7% fat, 60% \ncarbohydrate and 16% protein) (n=6). On day 8 and 15, the two subgroups were \nassessed in terms of  HTG content and on the last day of  experiment blood was \nwithdrawn from 6-h fasted animals for determination of  blood glycemia, plasma \nfree fatty acids (FFA) and triglyceride content. These animals were challenged \nby a glucose tolerance test consisting of  an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of  \nglucose (1.5 mg glucose/g of  body weight) and blood glycemia was assessed \nduring 60 min after the glucose load, in pre-determined intervals. Blood glucose \nconcentration was measured with a standard glucometer whereas plasma FFA \nand triglyceride levels were assessed using biochemical assay kits commercially \navailable from Wako Chemicals GmbH and Sigma, respectively.\n In study 2, a group of  animals (n=5) was maintained during 35 days on \nHF diet feeding, and on the last day assayed for HTG content by 1H MRS and \ncompared to a group of  animals fed with a SC diet (n=4). On the afternoon of  \nday 35, animals were given an i.p. injection of  8 mL of  99.9% deuterated water \n(2H\n\n2\nO) (Sigma-Aldrich) in physiological saline. At this point, the drinking water \n\nwas also enriched with 3% 2H\n2\nO to maintain constant body water enrichment until \n\nthe end of  the study. On day 37, animals were sacrificed at 14:00 h (24-h clock), \nlivers were collected and freeze-clamped for lipid analysis, blood withdrawn and \nimmediately centrifuged for plasma separation. Plasma was quickly stored at \n\n\n\n146 Chapter 6\n\n-80\u00baC. 6-h fasting plasma glucose and insulin were also measured. Insulin was \nmeasured using an ELISA assay from Linco Research.\n In study 3, Five rats were maintained on a HF diet during 8 days and \nafterwards switched back to a SC diet. On day 1, 8 and 15 of  experiment, liver \n1H MRS was performed to assess HTG levels in each animal. \n\n6.2.2. 1H Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) \n\n In vivo MRI and 1H MRS studies were performed on a 7 T Bruker \nPharmascan system using a whole body coil for radiofrequency transmitting \nand signal receiving. Animals were placed in their prone position, kept at 37\u00baC \nand anesthetized with isoflurane anesthetic and maintained under 1.0-1.5% \nisoflurane-oxygen (v/v) during the imaging and spectroscopy experiments. \nTransverse images of  the liver were used to ensure accurate positioning of  \nthe cubic voxel size of  5 mm in the region of  interest (ROI) of  liver (Figure \n6.1). Single-voxel volume-localized 1H MR spectra were obtained using a point-\nresolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence (repetition time, TR=1000 ms and \necho time, TE=28 ms) without water saturation and with 128 average scans \n(Kuhlmann et al. 2003). \n \nA B\n\nFigure 6.1. Axial (A), sagittal (B) and coronal (C) liver T2-weighted MR images used for \nhepatic localization and voxel placement.\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 6 147\n\n Spectra were analyzed using the NMR data processing program, \nMestreC (Mestrelab Research S.L., Spain), where peak areas for all resonances \nwere obtained and the lipid resonance corresponding to the methylene group, \n(CH\n\n2\n)\n\nn\n, arising from aliphatic fatty acid chains of  triglycerides was quantified with \n\nreference to the water resonance (Kuhlmann et al. 2003, Garbow et al. 2004). \n \n6.2.3. Liver triglyceride extraction protocol\n\n Hepatic lipids from freeze-clamped livers were separated by a Folch \nextraction (Folch et al. 1957) adding 20 mL of  a chloroform/ethanol solution 2/1 \n(v/v) for each gram of  liver powder under 15 min stirring at room temperature. \nAfter centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and diluted in NaCl (0.9%) \nin 5/1 (v/V) with vigorous agitation. Finally, after another centrifugation, the \nlower lipid-containing phase was collected, evaporated to dryness and dissolved \nin chloroform with pyrazine as an internal standard for NMR analysis.\n \n6.2.4. 1H and 2H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis\n\n 1H and 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 11.75 T with a Varian \nspectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broadband \u201cswitchable\u201d probe with z-\ngradient (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Proton-decoupled 2H NMR spectra were \nacquired without field-frequency lock at 25\u00baC using a 90\u00ba pulse, a 2.0 second \nacquisition time and a 2.0 second pulse delay. 2H-enrichment of  the aggregate \ntriglyceride methyl hydrogens, CH\n\n3\n, was quantified by comparing the composite \n\nHTG methyl 2H-signal with that of  an internal pyrazine deuterated standard. \nThe fraction of  HTG derived from DNL was estimated as HTG 2H-methyl/\nbody water 2H-enrichment. 2H body water enrichment was determined in each \nplasma sample using 2H NMR spectroscopy (Jones et al. 2001).\n\n \n\n\n\n148 Chapter 6\n\n6.2.5.     Estimating    hepatic    triglyceride    synthesis    from    de     novo  \n              lipogenesis    by     the    analysis    of    acyl    methyl    hydrogen \n                         2H-enrichment from 2H-enriched body water\n\n During DNL, the methyl hydrogens of  the acyl moiety are directly \nderived from those of  acetyl-CoA and do not participate in the desaturation \nand chain elongation reactions that occur during lipogenesis. To our knowledge, \nthere have been no direct measurements of  acetyl-CoA enrichment from 2H-\nenriched body water. Assuming that pyruvate is the main source of  lipogenic \nacetyl-CoA and given that the exchange of  pyruvate methyl protons with those \nof  water is 80-95% complete (Rognstad et al. 1974, Kuwajima et al. 1986), the \nenrichment of  body water is a good approximation for that of  the immediate \nacetyl-CoA precursor. Assuming that body water enrichment is equal to that of  \nthe acetyl-CoA precursor, the fraction of  triglyceride acyl groups derived from \nDNL (HTG lipogenic fraction) is simply the triglyceride enrichment divided by \nbody water enrichment, given by Eq. 6.1. \n\n In the 2H NMR spectrum, methyl signals from palmitoyl (C16) and \nstearoyl (C18) chains co-resonate (Zhang et al. 2006) hence the NMR measurement \nreports the methyl enrichment from both C16 and C18 acyl moieties. A \nsignificant portion of  stearyl acyl units are derived by an independent chain \nelongation reaction of  palmitoyl-CoA (Bassilian et al. 2002). However, since the \nchain is elongated at the carboxyl end of  the acyl moiety, the methyl hydrogens \nof  these elongated acyl moieties still represent the original lipogenic C16 moiety. \nTherefore, the 2H-enrichment level represents the total population of  acyl units \n(C16 plus C18) derived from lipogenesis.\n \n\n\t\nenrichmentwater body  H\nenrichmentmethyl acyl  H\n\n  100 (%) fraction lipogenic HTG 2\n2\n\n\u00d7=  [Eq. 6.1]\n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 6 149\n\n Study 1- Day 20 Study 2- Day 35 \n\n SC diet HF diet SC diet HF diet \n\nn 6 5 4 5 \n\nWeight gain, g 110 \u00b1 3 131 \u00b1 3 * 191 \u00b1 7 138 \u00b1 8* \n\nBlood glucose, mM 7.7 \u00b1 0.2 8.4 \u00b1 0.4 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 9.7 \u00b1 0.3 \n\nInsulin, ng/mL - - 0.27 \u00b1 0.07 0.34 \u00b1 0.11 \n\nFree fatty acids (FFA), mM 9.23 \u00b1 0.81 12.31 \u00b1 1.19 - - \n\nTriglycerides, mg/dL 76.4 \u00b1 5.0 70.4 \u00b1 7.3 - - \n\n\t\n\n6.2.6.

Study groups characteristics\n\n Table 6.1 shows the average weight gain for the 20 and 35 day study \ngroups (study 1 and 2) in addition to fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, FFA \nand triglyceride levels. HF diet-fed animals initially show an increased weight gain \ncompared to the controls but after 35 days of  HF diet, these animals showed a \ndecreased average weight gain relative to animals on a SC diet for the same time \nperiod. HF diet was previously shown to reduce appetite in rodents (Liu et al. \n2005), and therefore it can be speculated that the lower net weight gain in HF \ndiet-fed animals was likely due to diminished food intake. Fasting blood glucose, \nplasma insulin, FFA and triglyceride concentrations were not significantly \nmodified in animals placed on the HF diet compared to those maintained on \nSC. \n\nTABLE 6.1: Biochemical and physical characteristics of  the different groups of  animals \nstudied #.\n\n# Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM; * p<0.05 relative to the control group for each \nstudy.

In comparison, postprandial HF diet-fed rats attained maximum \nplasma glucose levels at 15 minutes after the challenge but subsequently, plasma \nglucose levels failed to return to basal levels by 60 minutes (60 minutes plasma \nglucose = 13.3 \u00b1 1.3 mM, p<0.05 compared to SC fed animals).  \n\n   \n   \n  \n   \n      \n\n   \n\n6.3.2.

The \ntriglyceride methyl hydrogens are directly traceable to the original acetyl-CoA \nprecursor and they are also well resolved in the 2H NMR spectrum of  hepatic \ntriglycerides isolated by a simple Folch extraction. The intensity of  the methyl \n2H NMR signal reflects both the 2H-enrichment at that site and the quantity of  \ntriglycerides in the NMR tube. Therefore, with constant triglyceride amounts, \ndifferences in 2H-signal intensities between two samples reflect different levels \nof  2H-enrichment. The spectra shown in Figure 6.5 represent 175 mmol portions \nof  hepatic triglycerides extracted from livers of  a SC and a HF diet-fed animal \n(Figure 6.5 A and B, respectively). The two samples had equivalent amounts of  \ntriglycerides, as shown by the equal triglyceride 1H NMR signal intensities of  \ntheir 1H NMR spectra. However, the 2H NMR signal intensities were ~10-fold \nhigher in SC compared to HF diet-fed animals, indicating that the extent of  \n2H-incorporation into the triglyceride of  the SC fed animal was much greater \ncompared to that of  its HF diet-fed companion. From the 1H and 2H NMR \ndata, triglyceride methyl 2H-enrichment levels were estimated as described in the \nmethods. By relating these enrichment values to that of  body water, the fraction \nof  HTG derived from de novo lipogenesis was derived (see Table 6.2). Body water \nenrichment was slightly but significantly elevated in HF fed animals relative to \nSC which may reflect a higher body lipid fraction in the former group. In animals \n\n\n\n154 Chapter 6\n\ngiven a SC diet, 10.9% \u00b1 1.0% of  total HTG was derived from lipogenesis over a \n48 h period while the remaining 89.1% \u00b1 1.0% was either obtained from dietary \nsources or was present before the administration of  deuterated water.

Discussion\n\n6.4.1. Effect of  diet on hepatic triglyceride levels\n\n When rats were placed on a HF diet for 5 weeks, HTG levels increased \naround 3-fold within the first week but then stabilized over the remaining four \nweeks. The results presented in here resemble previous studies of  HTG levels in \nrats placed on a HF diet where HTG, measured by the gold-standard post-mortem \nenzymatic assay, increased by 200% in the first two weeks of  HF diet (Gauthier et \nal. 2006). In a separate study, a 3-fold increase in HTG was found after 3 days of  \nplacement on a HF diet (Samuel et al. 2004) whereas others only showed a ~30% \nincrease in HTG after 4 weeks of  a diet containing 40% of  the total calories as \nlard (Hudgins et al. 1996). A 3-fold increase in HTG is a relatively modest change \nwhen compared to HTG levels in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis \n(NASH), the most severe form of  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), \nor in rat models of  diet-induced NASH. Normal human HTG levels are similar \nto that of  the rat (1-2%) while NASH subjects with or without T2D have HTG \nranging from 10-50%. In rat models of  diet-induced NASH (rats placed on a \ncholine-deficient diet), HTG accumulates to ~40% of  liver mass (Grattagliano \net al. 2003).  \n These studies showed that elevated HTG levels induced by HF diet \nfeeding quickly reverted to basal values when the rats were weaned on a SC \ndiet, thus demonstrating the reversibility of  this process and the high sensitivity \nof  HTG to diet modification. The findings reported in here are analogous to \nrecent observations in T2D patients, where elevated HTG levels were restored \nto normal values in a relatively short time by dietary intervention (Petersen et al. \n2005). Alterations in rat HTG levels were not accompanied by changes in plasma \ntriglycerides, suggesting that the liver may play a role as a systemic buffer in the \nface of  dietary fat overload. These observations also demonstrate that an increase \nin HTG is among the earliest observable change in whole body lipid status when \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 6 157\n\nrats are challenged by HF diet feeding and the utility of  localized single-voxel 1H \nMRS for noninvasively monitoring this change. However, even though single-\nvoxel 1H MRS was validated in vivo against histological and enzymatic assays of  \nHTG content (Szczepaniak et al. 1999, Garbow et al. 2004), possible caveats \ninclude the presence of  focal steatosis (Timlin and Parks 2005), where HTG \nconcentrations measured by localized MR might differ from the mean value \nmeasured by post-mortem enzymatic assay.   \n\n6.4.2. Sources of  hepatic triglycerides\n\n The fatty acid components of  HTG can be derived from outside the \nliver or can be synthesized within by DNL. While the contribution of  DNL to \nsystemic fatty acid synthesis has been determined in both rats and humans by \nvarious tracer methods, there are no reports on its contribution to HTG levels. \nEven though DNL rates are quite small in relation to total body lipid mass, they \nassume much higher significance in relation to the much smaller HTG pool size \nand could therefore play an important role in the regulation of  HTG levels.      \n The association between DNL flux assessed by whole body fatty acid \nsynthesis rates, HF feeding, and HTG has been explored in both healthy rats \nand T2D models. Placement of  both healthy rats and the lean littermates of  \nZDF rats on a HF diet resulted in a reduction of  DNL activity (Pichon et al. \n2006) whereas in the obese ZDF rats, with elevated HTG content (Kuhlmann \net al. 2003), DNL rates were unchanged (Lee et al. 2000). Since HTG levels \nreflect the balance between fatty acid import, DNL and triglycerides export, the \nrelationship between DNL fluxes and the contribution of  DNL to HTG levels \nis not known. The studies presented in here indicate that DNL contributions to \nHTG are modest for healthy animals on a SC diet but are essentially negligible \nwhen they are placed on a HF diet. Therefore, the increase in HTG levels during \nHF diet feeding is almost entirely driven by uptake and esterification of  extra-\nhepatic fatty acids.   \n\n\n\n158 Chapter 6\n\n The effects of  diet and pathophysiology on DNL in rats have strong \nparallels with observations of  DNL in humans. In humans, the fractional \ncontribution of  DNL to hepatic lipid synthesis was noninvasively inferred from \nthe analysis of  triglyceride derived from the plasma fraction of  very low density \nlipoproteins (VLDL) (Hudgins et al. 1996, Timlin and Parks 2005). In healthy \nhumans, HF feeding over 25 days resulted in a sharply reduced DNL contribution \nto VLDL triglyceride compared to subjects given a low fat diet (Hudgins et \nal. 1996). These observations bear a strong resemblance to the results in rats \npresented in here and indicate that for both healthy rats and humans, DNL is \nhighly attenuated by short term HF diet feeding. The effects of  longer term HF \nfeeding on DNL rates have not been characterized in humans. In subjects with \nNAFLD, a common endpoint of  excessive long term dietary fat intake, DNL \ncontributions were found to be chronically elevated under both fed and fasting \nconditions (Donnelly et al. 2005). These observations suggest that the regulation \nof  DNL by dietary substrates was not functional, and resemble the absence \nof  dietary DNL regulation observed in obese ZDF rats. Overall, these studies \nindicate a strong similarity in DNL between rats and humans and support the \nuse of  rat models for investigating the effects of  diet, endocrine status and \ninterventions on DNL. \n Deuterated water is a highly convenient tracer for quantifying DNL, \nas steady-state enrichment in plasma is achieved within minutes after an i.p. \ninjection bolus (see Chapter 4) which can then be maintained indefinitely by \nproviding a maintenance level of  2H\n\n2\nO enrichment in drinking water. However, \n\nthe measurement relies on some untested assumptions. It was considered that \npyruvate was the main source of  lipogenic acetyl-CoA and that the exchange \nof  pyruvate methyl protons with those of  the water is essentially complete \n(Rognstad et al. 1974, Kuwajima et al. 1986). Thus, the 2H-enrichment of  body \nwater is assumed to be equal to that of  acetyl-CoA and hence can be used as the \nprecursor enrichment. To the extent that the methyl hydrogens of  acetyl-CoA \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 6 159\n\nare not fully exchanged with those of  body water, the DNL contribution will \nbe underestimated. With Mass Spectrometry (MS) measurements of  2H lipid \nenrichment, a correction factor, known as the N value, corresponding to the \naverage number of  deuterium atoms incorporated into palmitate, is applied to \naccount for incomplete exchange (Diraison et al. 1996). For in vivo rat studies, N \nwas determined to be 22, corresponding to an exchange fraction of  22/31, or \n~75% complete. Acetyl-CoA precursors, such as pyruvate, exchange extensively \nwith bulk water, hence fatty acyl hydrogens derived directly from acetyl-CoA, \nincluding the terminal methyl hydrogens, may have a somewhat higher enrichment \nlevel (Rognstad et al. 1974, Kuwajima et al. 1986). Assuming a 75% rather than a \n100% extent of  2H-incorporation into acetyl-CoA, the reported DNL estimates \nwould increase from 10.9% to 14.3% for the SC fed rats and from 1.0% to 1.3% \nfor the HF diet group. \n The other key assumption behind our estimates of  lipogenic and non-\nlipogenic contribution to HTG is that the HTG pool turned over completely \nduring the 72 hour exposure to 2H\n\n2\nO. To the extent that HTG was incompletely \n\nturned over, this measurement underestimates the DNL contribution. In healthy \nhumans, 9.2 grams of  triglycerides per day are exported as VLDL (Vedala et al. \n2006). Assuming a liver mass of  1.5 kg and HTG levels of  1%, giving a HTG pool \nsize of  15 grams, the daily output represents ~60% of  HTG, hence the pool is \ncompletely replaced in less than 2 days. Given the faster basal metabolic rate of  \nthe rat, it was assumed that under this study conditions, HTG were completely \nturned over within the 72 hour period of  2H body water enrichment. However, \ntriglyceride turnover in steatotic livers may be longer, given the increased pool \nsize, hence under these conditions, the period of  body water 2H-enrichment may \nneed to be extended.  \n\n \n\n\n\n160 Chapter 6\n\n6.4.3. Relationship between hepatic triglycerides and glycemic status\n\n In animal models, glycemic control and IR are highly associated with \nthe accumulation of  triglycerides in liver and skeletal muscle (Oakes et al. 1997a, \nOakes et al. 1997b). These sites have a selective contribution to the pathogenesis \nof  IR and hyperglycemia in that the accumulation of  intramyocellular lipid \n(IMCL) in skeletal muscle impairs the action of  insulin on the whole body \ndisposal of  glucose, while increased hepatic triglyceride is associated with an \nimpairment of  endogenous glucose production (EGP). During the transition \nto HF diet feeding, the hepatic triglyceride pool - because of  its relatively small \nmass and high turnover \u2013 is likely to be modified faster and by a larger degree \ncompared to IMCL. Therefore at this early stage, the reduced ability of  insulin \nto suppress postprandial EGP could play an important role in the development \nof  glucose intolerance. \n Studies in healthy animals following 3 days on a HF diet showed that, \nwhile insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and basal EGP were not different from \ncontrol animals maintained on a SC diet, under hyperinsulinemic clamp conditions \nthere was an impaired suppression of  EGP, indicative of  hepatic IR (Gauthier et \nal. 2006). In this study, the extent of  glucose intolerance induced by 35 days of  \nHF feeding was relatively modest, as seen by comparable fasting blood glucose \nand insulin levels to animals maintained on the SC diet. A previous study reported \nenhanced IR and glucose intolerance after 4 weeks of  a HF diet (Srinivasan et al. \n2004). Seven weeks of  a HF diet in healthy rats was also associated with higher \nblood glucose 2 hours after the oral glucose challenge (Huang et al. 2004). The \nmild loss of  glucose tolerance that it was observed in this study may reflect the \nrelatively small increment of  HTG levels in comparison to that observed in \nT2D rat animal models with severe glucose intolerance (Garbow et al. 2004). In \ncomparison to the clamp measurement, a glucose tolerance test does not provide \ndirect measurements of  insulin action on glucose production and disposal fluxes \nand therefore may not resolve hepatic and peripheral IR. However, as with 1H \n\n\n\n\t \t \t      Chapter 6 161\n\nMRS analysis of  HTG, a glucose tolerance test can in principle be repeated in \nthe same animal and may therefore be useful for relating longitudinal changes in \nHTG with alterations in glycemic status for individual animals. \n\n6.5. Conclusions\n \n In healthy rats, hepatic triglyceride levels can be acutely raised or lowered \nby altering the dietary fat content and these changes can be effectively monitored \nby 1H MRS. During HF feeding, essentially all of  the hepatic triglyceride is \nderived from dietary lipid with very little contribution from DNL. 1H MRS \nis a noninvasive and accurate technique suitable for longitudinal studies of  \nevaluation of  hepatic triglyceride content in animal models and can be used for \nassessing the effects of  dietary interventions. The novel 2H NMR measurement \nof  hepatic triglyceride 2H-enrichment from 2H\n\n2\nO reported in here, in spite of  \n\nrequiring further validation, is a simple and practical approach for assessing the \ncontribution of  de novo lipogenesis to hepatic triglyceride levels.\n\n6.6.
