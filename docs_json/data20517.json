Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia\n\nOpen-pit mining in this region began in \n1982 and the resulting deposits have high sulfate \nconcentration that reduces the pH in shallow lakes. \nThe course of the Morozini River was modified \nmany times due to surface coal mining, and, as final \nconformation, the river water flows through the \nmining pits that were dug by a Marion dragline. The \npyrite waste was used to make gravel access roads \nto the mines. Many lakes near coalmines were used \nas dumps for the mining waste. Lakes have been \nformed in this region by the flow of underground \nand surface water into the mining pits (Waterloo, \n2002). In the study area, at present, there is no \nmore coal exploration and the lakes studied do not \nreceive mining waste.\n\nClimate type is wet subtropical with hot summer \n(Cfa - K\u00f6ppen\u2019s classification). Mean annual \ntemperature is 19\u00a0\u00b0C and total precipitation haste \nis 1600\u00a0 mm, distributed along the whole year, \nwithout well defined dry season. Mean monthly \ntemperature varies from 15\u00a0 \u00b0C in the winter to \n24\u00a0 \u00b0C in summer, with possible incident of frost \n(S\u00f4nego\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). According to these authors, \nfrom March to September, there is predominance \nof hot air mass and moisture, causing strong heating \nduring the days and formation of convective clouds. \nDuring the winter months, there is predominance \nof cold and dry polar air mass. For the series of 10 \nyears (Figure\u00a0 2), one can observe marked annual \npattern of temperature, with lower values   from \n\nsulfuric acid is produced which solves metals (Rose \nand Cravotta, 1998; Asta\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008).\n\nThe main objective of this work was to assess the \nwater quality of three lakes situated in an abandoned \ncoal mining area, submitted to anthropogenic \nimpacts. It is expected that these lakes have strong \nuse restriction, according to the Brazilian water \nquality regulation (CONAMA n\u00ba\u00a0357/2005).\n\n2. Study Area\n\nThe study region, is located in the south region \nof Santa Catarina State (Brazil), and has an area \nof 9,049\u00a0 km2, 9.8% of the total area of the state \n(Figure\u00a0 1); it has 39 towns and a population of \nmore than 800,000 inhabitants. The studied lakes \nare located in the Morozini River micro basin, near \nthe Treviso city. Morozini River micro basin is a \ntributary of the M\u00e3e Luzia River and is located in a \n4,200\u00a0m (large axis) by 3,400\u00a0m (small axis) valley, \nwith a topographical gradient of about 320\u00a0m.\n\nThe Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN), \nestablished in the 1950s, is a company that explored \nand processed coal in the region. In the 1960s, coal \nmining was intensified closer to Treviso and became \none of the most important economic activities. \nHowever, mining adversely affected other economic \nactivities and also had social and environmental \nconsequences causing a high level of pollution and \nreducing the water quality (Milioli, 1999).\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFigure 1.

The analysis was based on \na product-moment matrix obtained from a range-\nstandardized matrix (Legendre and Legendre, \n2003). The physical and chemical variables selected \nfor the PCA were temperature (t), total solids (TS), \ncalcium (Ca), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), iron (Fe), \nzinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), pH, electric conductivity \n(EC) and dissolved oxygen (DO).\n\n4. Results\n\nWater from Lakes 1 and 2 were micro stratified \nduring summer, and temperatures ranged from 27.2 \nto 31.1\u00a0\u00b0C. Water column of Lake 3 was relatively \nhomogeneous in the summer, with temperature \n\nMay to October. In 2003, when this research was \ndeveloped, the total precipitation was 1509.8\u00a0mm; \nannual mean minimum temperature was 15.4\u00a0\u00b0C \nand annual mean maximum temperature of \n20.0\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n3. Material and Methods\n\nThe study sites consisted of 3 lakes, mining pits \nflooded after deactivation, near the drainage basin \nof the Morozini River (Treviso, Santa Catarina \nState, Brazil) (Figure\u00a01). Samplings were carried out \nconsidering a profile through the limnetic region in \ntwo seasons (summer, the month of February, and \nwinter, the month of July, 2003).\n\nPhysical and chemical variables of the water \nwere analyzed (Table\u00a01). To analyze the total and \ndissolved nutrients concentration, water samples \nwere collected and filtered in\u00a0 situ through a \nWhatman GF/C 47\u00a0 mm membrane.

Low DO concentration in the deepest \nparts of Lake 1 in the summer is probably due to \nthe consumption of oxygen in oxidation of pyrite, \na process that results in dissolution of certain ions \nand metals such as SO4\n\n\u20132, Fe, Mn, Zn and Ni \n(Blunden\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2001).\n\nData obtained in the winter showed that most \nof the solid fraction in all three lakes is in dissolved \nform, SO4\n\n\u20132 and Ca, mainly, and that the particulate \nmatter accounts for only a small part of the TS.\n\nThe high EC values for Lakes 1 and 2 are \nprobably due to the high ion concentration, \nespecially SO4\n\n\u20132 (above 500\u00a0mg.L\u20131) and Ca (higher \nthan 180\u00a0mg.L\u20131) that also contribute to high TS \nvalues. In Lake 3, the lowest values of EC may be a \n\nFigure 7.

The results of Waterloo \n(op\u00a0 cit.) are similar to those found in this study. \nHowever, our study found much lower pH values, \nwhich can be partly explained by the addition of \nCa(OH)2 in Lakes 1 and 2 after Waterloo\u2019s study.\n\nThe most extreme changes in water quality found \nby Waterloo (2002) were for the subterranean water \n(pH approximately 4.0; sulfate\u00a0 >\u00a0 1000\u00a0 mg.L\u20131, \nFe\u00a0>\u00a0100\u00a0mg.L\u20131). This author concludes that the \nhigher pH values are due to the flow of oxidized \nSO4\n\n\u20132 from the pyrite in the mining debris and also \nas a by-product of secondary reactions involving Fe \nin anaerobic conditions.\n\nThe Brazilian legislation, in accordance with \nCONAMA Resolution 357 (Brasil, 2005), \nclassifies water quality in order to assess the \nenvironmental quality of lakes and ponds. The \nCONAMA Resolution also defines proper water \nuse, according to the biological, chemical and \nphysical characteristics of each class. Five freshwater \nclasses have been defined for typical use and human \nconsumption. The Special Class, represent the water \ncrud used in the water supply after disinfection \n(more restrictive use), and the Class 1 to 4. Class \n4 is to use less restrictive, such as navigation and \nharmonious landscape.\n\nThe lakes in our study had a range of chemical \nand physical characteristics, which show that the \nwater quality was seriously affected. For some \nvariables, these lakes failed to meet the necessary \ncriteria for classification standards (Table\u00a04). Based \non the values found in the superficial water, the Lakes \n\nCa(OH)2, which increases the water solubility of \nthese ions. A high SO4\n\n\u20132 concentration was found \nby Silvano and Raya-Rodriguez (2003) in Lagoa \nAzul, a lake located close to the site of this study, in \nthe coal-producing basin of Sider\u00f3polis city. These \nauthors attributed this condition to the oxidation \nof pyrite from coal mining.\n\nData of pH, EC, TS, SO4\n-2, Ca Mg, Na, K, \n\nAl, and Sr, mainly in the Lake 3, indicate that \ncoal mining has made a strong environmental \nimpact. Lakes 1 and 2 discriminated from Lake \n3, mainly because the last was strongly affected \nby the coal mining, due a CSN intervention with \nthe addition of Ca(OH)2. However, all three lakes \nremain exposed to high pyrite content and are, \nconsequently, highly affected by the coal mining \nprocess.\n\nPrevious studies carried out in the basins of \nRivers Conde, Ratos and Porteira (Rio Grande \ndo Sul state, Brazil) registered mean pH values \nof about 6.0. Extreme values of 2.6 and 2.7 were \nfound in some locations probably due to the impact \nof mining on the drainage basin. Low pH values \nin areas where coal mining takes place are often \ndue to nearby pyrite deposits (Zanardi\u00a0Junior and \nPorto, 1991).\n\nThe highest aluminium concentrations observed \nin Lake 3 are probably due to the lower pH values, \nwhich increase Al solubility. The concentration of \nAl in freshwater around the world varies according \nto pH values. Al concentrations are higher when \npH is low (Siegfried\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1989). In the Pantano \nLake, a pH of around 3.9 was associated with Al \nconcentrations of 0.1 to 3.7\u00a0mg.L\u20131 (Courtijn\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n1987 apud Azevedo and Chasin, 2003). Lake Shield \n(Ontario and Quebec, Canada) showed pH values \nranging from 4.4 to 7.1 and Al concentrations \nranging from 0.05 to 0.37\u00a0mg.L\u20131. Lake Ip\u00ea (Parana \nState, Brazil), an area relatively untouched by \nmankind, has low Al concentrations ranging from \n8 to 21\u00a0\u00b5g.L\u20131 (Barreto\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005). In this study, \nAl concentrations are higher than those mentioned \nabove.\n\nSimilar SO4\n\u20132, Fe, Al and Mg concentrations \n\nfound in Morozini River lakes also were found in \nlakes of the Fiorita River basin (Sider\u00f3polis City, \nSanta Catarina State, Brazil) (Pomp\u00eao\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004). \nThese lakes in Fiorita River basin also are located \nin abandoned coal mining area, explored with the \nsame procedures practiced in the Morozini River.\n\nIn a previous study in the lakes located in \nMorozini River basin, Waterloo (2002) stated that \nthe lakes were used as dumps for coal mining waste, \n\nTable 4.
