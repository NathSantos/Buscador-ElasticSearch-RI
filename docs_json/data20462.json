In the Jundia\u00ed River Catchment, Southeastern Brazil, the main factor that influences\n\nwell productivity is the existence of open discontinuities permeability in geologic environments that favor groundwater\n\nrecharge. In that area, Pre-Cambrian shear and fault zones were reactivated throughout geologic time, controlling\n\nthe morphostructural compartments and the Cenozoic sedimentary deposition. Superposition of productivity data and\n\nstructural maps showed that more productive wells are concentrated mainly along the regional geologic structures. The\n\nstructural control over well productivity is also noticeable in detailed scale. Using fine scale maps we show that the\n\nmost productive wells are located in areas where brittle structures with NW\u2013 SE and E\u2013 W directions denote the action\n\nof neotectonic transtensional stress. The comprehension of evolutionary geologic history allied to fracturing analysis\n\nproved to be an efficient and a low cost technique, which is adequate for selecting areas for further developments using\n\nmore expensive methods.\n\nKey words: groundwater, crystalline rocks, tectonics, Jundia\u00ed, Southeastern Brazil.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe industrialization in Southeastern Brazil, allied to\n\na lack of investments in water resources management,\n\nbrought the unbalance between water supply and water\n\ndemand, particularly in the neighborhood of S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nMetropolitan Area, as the one studied in this report.

The lithotype, the presence of sedimentary\n\ncover and/or weathering layer, the geologic structures,\n\nthe tectonics and in situ tension are between the most\n\nstudied factors.\n\nIn the Jundia\u00ed River Catchment, the structural con-\n\ntrol on well productivity is pronounced, although influ-\n\nences of other factors may also exist (Neves 2005). In\n\nthe present study we investigate the structural control\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\n308 MIRNA A. NEVES and NORBERTO MORALES\n\nthrough the analysis of well productivity variation ac-\n\ncording to the position of geologic structures, in regional\n\nand local scales. The Jundia\u00ed River Catchment offers\n\nexcellent opportunities for these studies due to the pres-\n\nence of geologic structures reactivated by tectonic events\n\nthat control the landforms and the formation of sedimen-\n\ntary deposits. Furthermore, the occurrence of sedimen-\n\ntary coverings in the crystalline basement allows for the\n\ndefinition of geologic evolution and permits the identifi-\n\ncation of neotectonic activity.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nWell data compiled by Neves (2005) were obtained from\n\nthe governmental agency responsible for water manage-\n\nment in S\u00e3o Paulo State, the DAEE \u2013 Departamento\n\nde \u00c1guas e Energia El\u00e9trica (Water and Electric En-\n\nergy Department), from the CPRM \u2013 Servi\u00e7o Geol\u00f3gico\n\nNacional (National Geologic Survey) and from a well-\n\ndrilling company. Only the wells that have measures\n\nof static level, dynamic level and pumping rate, besides\n\nco-ordinates for their location, were considered. The\n\nstudy relies on data from 590 wells that exploit the Crys-\n\ntalline Aquifer System, 33 wells that exploit the Tubar\u00e3o\n\nAquifer System and 25 that exploit both.\n\nThe specific capacity (m3/h/m) was used in this\n\nwork as the measure of well productivity. It is deter-\n\nmined from a test that involves pumping a well at a con-\n\nstant rate and measuring the resulting drawdown in water\n\nlevel (Mace 1997). Such measure has been adopted as\n\na representative parameter of well productivity (Berta-\n\nchini 1988, Chilton and Foster 1995) and is also known\n\nas \u201c Q/s\u201d.\n\nThe study was conducted in two ways: in regional\n\nscale, involving all the Jundia\u00ed River Catchment and\n\nneighborhood, and in local scale, through the investi-\n\ngation of cases in several selected areas.\n\nFor the regional scale analysis (1:250,000), the sim-\n\nple planar surface was used to calculate the residuals map\n\nof specific capacity. The simple planar surface is de-\n\nfined as the surface that best fix to a group of mapped data\n\nand the residuals constitute local variations that deviate\n\nfrom the regional tendency toward negative or positive\n\nvalues, which are used for anomalies detection (Agter-\n\nberg 1974, Davis 1986, Landim 2003). Thereby, the\n\nmost productive wells appear in the residuals map as el-\n\nevated positive residuals. These maps were superposed\n\nto the lineaments and regional structures maps in order\n\nto detect possible correlations by visual inspection.\n\nThe methodologies proposed by Liu (1987) and\n\nWise (1982) were pursued for tracing lineaments, mak-\n\ning use of radar imagery and aerial photographs. The\n\nterm \u201c lineament\u201d was adopted according to O\u2019 Leary et\n\nal. (1976), who consider a lineament as a simple or com-\n\nposed linear feature whose parts are aligned in a recti-\n\nlinear or curvilinear way, which differ from the adjacent\n\nfeature patterns presumably as a reflex of a sub-superfi-\n\ncial phenomenon.\n\nIn the local scale study (1:50,000), some areas were\n\nselected according to the availability of well and struc-\n\ntural data collected in survey works or extracted from\n\nthematic maps. The explanations to the \u201c productivity\n\nanomalies\u201d, i.e., to the situations where highly produc-\n\ntive wells are close to lowly productive or unproduc-\n\ntive wells, were investigated by constructing geologic-\n\nstructural sections. Wells considered as \u201c lowly produc-\n\ntive\u201d have specific capacity smaller than 0.05 m3/h/m\n\nand the \u201c highly productive\u201d ones have specific capacity\n\ngreater than or equal to 0.5 m3/h/m.\n\nCHARACTERIZATION OF THE STUDY AREA\n\nThe study area constitutes a rectangular polygon that in-\n\nvolves all the Jundia\u00ed River Catchment, between 46?30?\nand 47?20? W Gr. and 23?00? and 23?20? S (Figure 1).\nThis basin is located less than 100 km from the At-\n\nlantic coast, but the mountains of the Atlantic Plateau\n\ndirect the drainage towards inland. The Jundia\u00ed River\n\nbegins in the Serra da Mantiqueira (Mantiqueira Moun-\n\ntain Range), where the altitudes vary from 1,000 to 1,200\n\nmeters above sea level, and ends up in the Tiet\u00ea River, in\n\naltitudes of approximately 550 meters (S\u00e3o Paulo 2000).\n\nThe area of the basin is about 1,114 km2 and its main trib-\n\nutaries are the Jundia\u00ed-Mirim River and the Pira\u00ed Stream.\n\nGEOLOGIC AND HYDROGEOLOGIC SETTING\n\nMost of the catchment is located on the crystalline or\n\nPre-Cambrian basement area (Figure 2a). Rocks of the\n\nAmparo Complex predominate, composed mainly of\n\ngneiss with intercalations of quartzites, schists and am-\n\nphibolites (Hasui et al. 1981). In the southern part of\n\nthe area, rocks of the S\u00e3o Roque Domain occur, which\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL CONTROL OVER WELL PRODUCTIVITY IN THE JUNDIA\u00cd RIVER CATCHMENT 309\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Location of the Jundia\u00ed River Catchment, the main highways and urban areas.\n\nis constituted mainly by phyllites with intercalations of\n\nquartzites and calc-silicate rocks, beyond schists, meta-\n\ncherts and marbles (Juliani and Beljavskis 1995). Grani-\n\ntic intrusions are very common for both units.\n\nThe Crystalline Aquifer System is composed of\n\nPre-Cambrian basement units (Figure 2b) and, therefore,\n\nits permeability depends on the occurrence of disconti-\n\nnuities such as faults and joints and, sometimes, litho-\n\nlogic contacts (Neves 2005). Over the fractured rock, the\n\nweathering layer can form an aquifer of granular poros-\n\nity, responsible by the most part of the catchment base\n\nflow (M.F.C. Lopes, unpublished data).\n\nSedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age belonging to\n\nItarar\u00e9 Group occupy the west side of the area, in the\n\nParan\u00e1 Sedimentary Basin (Figure 2a), where compose\n\nthe Tubar\u00e3o Aquifer System (Figure 2b). The influence\n\nof glacial climate in the genesis of these rocks gives\n\nheterogeneous characteristics to them, as the vertical and\n\nhorizontal compositional variability, which induces low\n\npermeability and limited potentiality to the aquifer\n\n(Stevaux et al. 1987, Diogo et al. 1984). Even where\n\nsandstone layers are considerably thick, there is a great\n\nvariability of specific capacity of wells due to the layers\n\ndiscontinuity (A.C. Vidal, unpublished data).\n\nAlluvial Quaternary deposits, that occupy the allu-\n\nvial plain along the main rivers (Neves et al. 2005a), com-\n\npose the Cenozoic Aquifer System (Figure 2b). Other\n\nsedimentary Cenozoic deposits are also present but do\n\nnot form aquifers due to their restrict occurrence, just\n\ncovering tops and hill slopes. These are the Tertiary de-\n\nposits \u2013 that registry an ancient alluvial fan system orig-\n\ninated from Japi Mountain Range \u2013 and the colluvial-\n\nelluvial deposits \u2013 spread along the hills (Neves et al.\n\n2005b) (Figure 2a).\n\nSTRUCTURAL AND TECTONIC SETTING\n\nDuctile shear zones and faults with regional extension\n\n(Figure 2a) compartment the area in tectonic blocks,\n\ncontrol the relief, the deposition of sediments and the\n\nconfiguration of the Jundia\u00ed River Catchment (Neves et\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\n310 MIRNA A. NEVES and NORBERTO MORALES\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 (a) Geologic map and (b) hydrogeologic map of the Jundia\u00ed River Catchment.\n\nal. 2003). The Jundiuvira Shear Zone (Figure 2a) has\n\nNE\u2013 SW direction that inflects to E\u2013 W, and the Itu, Pi-\n\nra\u00ed, Cururu and Cachoeira faults have NW\u2013 SE direction\n\nthat also inflects to E\u2013 W (Hasui et al. 1978). The Va-\n\nlinhos and Campinas shear zones (Brasil 1979, S.R.F.\n\nVlach 1985, unpublished data) are also important in this\n\narea and cross by the Jundia\u00ed River Catchment following\n\nNNE\u2013 SSW to NE\u2013 SW directions (Neves 2005). The Ex-\n\ntrema Shear Zone, with the same direction, cut the east\n\nside of the area, in the Atibaia region.\n\nSuch structures, inherited from the Pre-Cambrian,\n\narose under ductile conditions and developed outstand-\n\ning mylonitic foliation and mineral remobilization.\n\nThroughout geologic time, the conditions became more\n\nand more brittle, but the tectonic tensions continued\n\nbeing alleviated along those regional geologic structures.\n\nIn other words, the Pre-Cambrian structures acted as\n\ncrustal weakness zones during all the geologic evolution\n\nof the area.\n\nFrom this evolutionary history it is important to de-\n\nfine two main tectonic phases, which understanding is\n\nfundamental to this work: the extensional regime that\n\nacted in the Gondwana break-up and the transcurrent\n\nneotectonic regime that came later.\n\nThe extensional regime, that culminated with the\n\ncontinental separation, had a regional tensor with ?1 ver-\n\ntical, ?2 NE\u2013 SW horizontal and ?3 NW\u2013 SE horizontal\n\n(Figure 3a). Under this arrangement, normal faults and\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL CONTROL OVER WELL PRODUCTIVITY IN THE JUNDIA\u00cd RIVER CATCHMENT 311\n\nopen joints arise predominantly in NE\u2013 SW direction and\n\nthere is tendency of opening in discontinuities with NE\u2013\n\nSW direction inherited from the Pre-Cambrian.\n\nThis extensional regime progressively was substi-\n\ntuted by a transcurrent regime linked to the rotation of\n\nthe South-American Plate to the West, process that has\n\nbeen defined as a neotectonic event (e.g. Hasui 1990,\n\nSaadi 1993, Riccomini and Assump\u00e7\u00e3o 1999). Some di-\n\nvergences exist in the literature about the neotectonic\n\ndeformational events, but there is an agreement with re-\n\nspect to the existence of a transcurrent dextral phase,\n\nthat would be unique or, at least, very important. Under\n\nthis regime, a conjugated pair of tensions acts along the\n\nE\u2013 W direction (Figure 3b) and tends to form open dis-\n\ncontinuities in NW\u2013 SE direction and transcurrent dextral\n\nfaults in E\u2013 W direction, between other structures.\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Regional tectonic movements with the principal structures that\n\narisen out and the tension and deformation ellipsoids of (a) the exten-\n\nsional regime, that acted from Upper Cretaceous up to the Paleogene\n\nand (b) the dextral transcurrent regime, initiated on Neogene.\n\nVARIATION OF WELL PRODUCTIVITY IN\nREGIONAL SCALE\n\nSuperposition of the lineament and structural maps and\n\nthe residual maps of specific capacity were done sepa-\n\nrately to wells that exploit the Crystalline Aquifer Sys-\n\ntem, the Tubar\u00e3o Aquifer System and both systems. The\n\npositive residuals show places that correspond to more\n\nproductive wells, that are detached relating to others,\n\ni.e., they indicate productivity anomalies.\n\nPRODUCTIVITY AND LINEAMENTS\n\nIn the Crystalline Aquifer System, association between\n\nproductivity anomalies and lineament density is not ob-\n\nservable, neither to that traced in regional scale nor to\n\nthat traced in more detailed scale (Figure 4). The same\n\noccur with the wells that exploit the Tubar\u00e3o Aquifer\n\nSystem and with the wells that exploit both the aquifers\n\n(Figure 5).\n\nIn those areas with low lineaments density, the sed-\n\nimentary covers generally are present and the weather-\n\ning layer tends to be thicker. Thus, the lineaments be-\n\ncome disguised and cannot be observed in the remote\n\nsensing images. However, where the fracture density is\n\ngreater, the rocks are easily attacked by weathering and,\n\ndepending on their original composition, highly perme-\n\nable material can be formed. Therefore, one could expect\n\nthe presence of positive residuals in locations where low\n\nlineaments density occur.\n\nPRODUCTIVITY AND REGIONAL STRUCTURES\n\nThe superposition of specific capacity residual maps and\n\nthe map of faults and shear zones show close associative\n\nrelations between some productivity anomalies and the\n\nstructural traces (Figure 6).\n\nThe most prominent point with positive residual\n\nvalue occurs close to the Cachoeira Fault. Similarly,\n\nthere are points of positive anomalies throughout the\n\nValinhos Shear Zone, in its intersection with the Cu-\n\nruru Fault, in the Campinas Shear Zone and next the Itu\n\nFault. Between the faults with NW\u2013 SE direction that\n\ncontrol the scarps of the Jardim Mountain Range, and\n\nthroughout there, points with high positive residuals can\n\nalso be seen.\n\nPoints with high productivity unlinked to the trace\n\nof regional structures exist only in two regions. One of\n\nthem is the central portion of the area and the other is\n\nsouthward to the Jundiuvira Shear Zone. The last one\n\nis associated to the presence of the carbonatic metassed-\n\niments of the S\u00e3o Roque Domain, which have an im-\n\nportant hole in high well yields (Neves 2005). On the\n\nother hand, the positive anomalies located in the central\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\n312 MIRNA A. NEVES and NORBERTO MORALES\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 Residual maps of specific capacity of wells that exploit the Crystalline Aquifer System with the\n\nlineaments traced from (a) the radar images in 1:250.000 scale and (b) the aerial photography in 1:60.000 scale.\n\nregion are due to the morphostructural compartments.\n\nCentral region is relatively depressed and surrounded by\n\nthe mountains that delimitate the Jundia\u00ed River Catch-\n\nment and by the structural barrier of Itu granitic massive\n\n(Neves et al. 2003).\n\nThe positive productivity anomalies of wells that\n\nexploit the Tubar\u00e3o Aquifer System and that exploit\n\nboth aquifers also have a notable association with the\n\nregional structures (Figure 7). The points with high posi-\n\ntive residuals are associated to the Campinas Shear\n\nZone, which crosses the area in NNE\u2013 SSW direction.\n\nAlthough the Tubar\u00e3o Aquifer System is a porous aquifer,\n\nthe structural control also plays an important hole. In-\n\ndeed, springs were detected along joints that affect sand-\n\nstones of the Tubar\u00e3o Group (Neves 2005).\n\nVARIATION OF WELL PRODUCTIVITY IN LOCAL SCALE\n\nAlthough there is a close association between the re-\n\ngional geologic structures and the presence of highly\n\nproductive wells, the analysis in local scale (1:50,000 or\n\nmore) show that even in the areas where highly produc-\n\ntive wells occur, other wells with low productivity also\n\nexist. The heterogeneity of the fractured rock gives rise\n\nto situations where one well cross a productive fractured\n\nzone meanwhile other, next to it, cross the massive rock.\n\nSeveral similar cases were identified in the studied\n\narea. In most of them the median specific capacity (con-\n\nsidering all wells) is superior to the median calculated\n\nfor the sample that exploit the Crystalline Aquifer Sys-\n\ntem of the area as a whole (Q/smed = 0.07 m\n3/h/m).

Three\n\ntypical examples are presented below.\n\nHIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WELLS FROM CABRE\u00da VA\n\nIn the Cabre\u00fava region, there are gneisses, migmatites,\n\nquartizites and granites of the crystalline basement, as\n\nwell as Cenozoic colluvial-elluvial and alluvial deposits\n\n(Figure 8). The Pira\u00ed Fault, in the NW\u2013 SE direction and\n\nother structures in E\u2013 W and N\u2013 S directions cut this area.\n\nAlthough the Pira\u00ed fault appears as a simple trace, it is, in\n\nfact, a fault zone of changeable thickness, dipping with\n\nhigh angle towards southwest. The structures with E\u2013\n\nW directions also have high dip angle and form fracture\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\n314 MIRNA A.

To analyze the structural influence in the\n\nspatial variation of productivity, the wells number 626,\n\n630 and 2580/99 were selected, the first one with spe-\n\ncific capacity equal to 0.56 m3/h/m and the two others\n\nwith specific capacity of 0.05 and 0.04 m3/h/m, respec-\n\ntively. The geological sections illustrated in the Figure 8\n\nshow the 626 well crossing, in subsurface, the structures\n\nwith NW\u2013 SE and E\u2013 W directions, which provide the\n\nhigh productivity to the well. The wells number 630 and\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL CONTROL OVER WELL PRODUCTIVITY IN THE JUNDIA\u00cd RIVER CATCHMENT 315\n\n2580/99 are located near the same structures, but do not\n\nintercept the main structures in depth and, consequently,\n\ntheir productivities are low.\n\nHIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WELLS FROM JACAR\u00c9 DISTRICT\n\nAnother similar case was identified in the Jacar\u00e9 Dis-\n\ntrict, near the Marechal Rondon Highway (Figure 9).\n\nTwo important structures cross this area: the Cururu\n\nFault, with NW\u2013 SE direction and high dip to SW, and\n\nthe Valinhos Shear Zone, with NNE\u2013 SSW direction and\n\nalso high dip to ESE. There are E\u2013 W structures, which\n\ncontrol Cenozoic deposits occurrences, as well as N\u2013 S\n\nstructures that control the relief dissection giving rise to\n\nravines with the same direction.\n\nIn this place, the median specific capacity of wells is\n\nequal to 0.05 m3/h/m, minor than the median specific ca-\n\npacity of wells in the crystalline. But one of the wells has\n\nhigh productivity: the well number 301/48, with specific\n\ncapacity equal to 1.61 m3/h/m. The other two selected\n\nwells have low productivity: the well number 81, with\n\n0.03 m3/h/m and the well number 44, with 0.04 m3/h/m.\n\nThe geological sections (Figure 9) show that, even lo-\n\ncated near similar lineaments, the productivity are very\n\ndifferent depending on the location relating to the geo-\n\nlogic structures in subsurface.\n\nHIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WELLS FROM LOUVEIRA\n\nThe third case involves the Louveira County, where gran-\n\nites and gneisses of Amparo Complex, alluvial deposits\n\nin the Capivari river alluvial plain and colluvial-elluvial\n\ndeposits along of its margins coexist (Figure 10). A high\n\nnumber of wells exist in this area, whose median specific\n\ncapacity is equal to 0.15 m3/h/m, almost two times the\n\nmedian of the Crystalline System of the whole area. This\n\ncase stands out by the presence of E\u2013 W and NW\u2013 SE lin-\n\neaments and, furthermore, a ramification of the Valinhos\n\nShear Zone crossing the area in NNE\u2013 SSW direction.\n\nGeological sections were constructed in two loca-\n\ntions where four wells in situations clearly controlled by\n\nstructures are present (Figure 10). The wells number 711\n\nand 727 have productivity considered high (specific ca-\n\npacities of 1.22 and 1.17 m3/h/m, respectively) and the\n\nwells number 737 and 6570 demonstrate low productiv-\n\nity (0.17 and 0.02 m3/h/m).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nStatistic correlations between productivity of wells and\n\ntheir distance to lineaments, length of lineaments, den-\n\nsity of lineaments or number of lineament intersections\n\nis a common method used to evaluate the chances of\n\nfinding groundwater in crystalline terrains (e.g. Hard-\n\ncastle 1995, Loiselle and Evans 1995, Mayer and Sharp\n\n1998). However, some authors emphasize that an in-\n\ntrinsic subjectivity of lineament tracing does exist (Wise\n\n1982, Tam et al. 2004). Others suggest applying \u201c re-\n\nproducibility tests\u201d by selecting just the traces that two\n\nor more professionals consider as lineaments (Mabee et\n\nal. 1994, Sander et al. 1997).\n\nIn addition, the structural characterization of the\n\nfeatures that are revealed in the lineaments, such as their\n\ntypology, the dip angle and other particular characteris-\n\ntics is of fundamental importance. In the studied area,\n\nthe simple superposition of maps was capable to show\n\nthat correlations between positive productivity anoma-\n\nlies and the density of lineaments do not exist in both of\n\nthe applied scales (Figures 4 and 5). The reason for this\n\nis that the sedimentary covering and the thick weathering\n\nlayer can mask the geologic structures of the underlying\n\nbasement and, consequently, the different lineament den-\n\nsities that one observe in the remote sensing imagery do\n\nnot necessarily reflect the fracturing rate of the geologic\n\nsubstratum. Otherwise, one important characteristics of\n\nthis area is the conspicuous contrast between landforms\n\nwith sedimentary cover and pediments beside of others\n\nwith exposed rocks and rough relief. The first ones tend\n\nto show low lineament density and, according to Sing-\n\nhal and Gupta (1999), greater capacity for groundwater\n\nsupplying.\n\nThe study in regional scale show that the specific\n\ncapacity anomalies tend to occur besides the regional\n\nstructures represented by the shear zones and the fault\n\nzones that delineate the morphostructural compartments.\n\nOne fact that reaffirms the influence of these structures\n\nin the groundwater flow at relatively high depths is the\n\npresence of thermal water springs along the Valinhos\n\nShear Zone registered by Hasui et al. (1989). The as-\n\nsociation between highly productive wells and regional\n\nstructures that are similar to the ones that occur in the\n\nstudied area (NW\u2013 SE and NNE\u2013 SSW directions) was\n\nalso identified in the Campinas region by Fernandes and\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\n316 MIRNA A. NEVES and NORBERTO MORALES\n\nFig. 8 \u2013 The case study of Cabre\u00fava County, where there is control by NW\u2013 SE and E\u2013 W structures in well productivity.\n\nFig. 9 \u2013 The second case study, in the neighborhood of Jacar\u00e9 District.

(1994) affirm that inten-\n\nsively fractured zones, with dozens kilometers in exten-\n\nsion, can form great hydraulic conductors, meanwhile\n\nother authors call attention to the fact that not always\n\nregional structures are in fact the most productive (e.g.\n\nBanks et al. 1992, Nilsen 1998). The discontinuity fill-\n\ning would be an important factor in this case, because\n\nthe major fractured zones tend to develop clayey filling\n\nby the alteration of fragmented material. But the kind\n\nof filling depends on the original material and, if the\n\nrock is rich in quartz, as granites, gneiss and quartzites,\n\nwhich are abundant in the studied area, the altered ma-\n\nterial can be highly permeable (Davis and Turk 1964,\n\nSinghal and Gupta 1999, Neves 2005).\n\nAlthough the existence of fractures is a fundamen-\n\ntal factor to defining well productivity in crystalline ter-\n\nrain, certain characteristics such as their aperture should\n\nbe favorable to groundwater flow (Lachassagne et al.\n\n2001, Banks et al. 1996, Banks and Robins 2002). The\n\nformation of open discontinuities and/or the opening of\n\npre-existent discontinuities occur according to the orien-\n\ntation of the major horizontal tectonic tension. In this\n\nway, the effects of the extensional tectonic in NE\u2013 SW\n\nstructures and the transtensional effects of the transcur-\n\nrent tectonic in NW\u2013 SE structures are of a prime impor-\n\ntance to groundwater flow in the fractured rock, mainly\n\nif they are associated to others of E\u2013 W directions.\n\nHowever, the fact that one structure is favorable to\n\npercolation of water does not indicate that it is related\n\nto neotectonic tension action. Older structures can also\n\nremain opened through geologic time, especially in in-\n\ntraplate setting, where tectonic tensions are smaller than\n\nin plate borders.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe morphostructural compartment limits, marked by\n\nshear zones and regional faults, are favorable sites to\n\nobtain productive wells. Nevertheless, the wells should\n\nbe located favorably to the structural dip and, further, the\n\nstructures should be originally opened or submitted to\n\nextensional tensions during tectonic reactivations.\n\nAccording to the fracturing analysis and the defini-\n\ntion of geologic evolution, the geological structures po-\n\ntentially opened have NE\u2013 SW direction (fracture zones\n\nassociated to the extensional tectonic that worked from\n\nthe final of Mesozoic to the beginning of Tertiary), NW\u2013\n\nSE direction (normal faults and open fractures formed or\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)\n\n\n\n318 MIRNA A. NEVES and NORBERTO MORALES\n\nreactivated by the neotectonic event) and E\u2013 W direction\n\n(very important when associated to the NW\u2013 SE struc-\n\ntures, that characterize transtensional zones).\n\nAssociated to the geologic evolution study, the\n\nstructural analysis can be used to indicate the structures\n\nor the areas that provide higher chances of obtaining pro-\n\nductive wells. For a precise location of wells, the studies\n\nin regional scale are necessary and are as important as\n\nthe study in detailed scale.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe financial support for this research was given by\n\nConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tec-\n\nnol\u00f3gico (CNPq).

Na\n\nbacia do rio Jundia\u00ed, Regi\u00e3o Sudeste do Brasil, a exist\u00eancia de\n\ndescontinuidades abertas em situa\u00e7\u00f5es geol\u00f3gicas favor\u00e1veis \u00e0\n\nrecarga constitui o principal fator que influencia a produtivi-\n\ndade dos po\u00e7os.
