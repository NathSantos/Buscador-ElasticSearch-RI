O primeiro grupo de materiais consiste em materiais porosos \n\nobtidos a partir de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma mistura de microesferas met\u00e1licas com \n\nmicroesferas de vidro. As propriedades dos materiais porosos preparados com \n\napenas microsferas de vidro j\u00e1 foram estudadas; o estudo aqui descrito tem \n\ncomo objectivo investigar a influencia de misturar microesferas met\u00e1licas nas \n\npropriedades mec\u00e2nicas do produto final. Os resultados indicam que as \n\nmicroesferas met\u00e1licas diminuem a resist\u00eancia do material e essa diminui\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\ndependente da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de esferas met\u00e1licas; ap\u00f3s certa concentra\u00e7\u00e3o a \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 acentuada. Prop\u00f5e-se uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o provis\u00f3ria. Tamb\u00e9m foi \n\nestudada a morfologia de fractura utilizando a t\u00e9cnica de microscopia \u00f3ptica. O \n\nsegundo grupo de materiais foi preparado a partir de esferas ocas met\u00e1licas e \n\numa resina. O objectivo final \u00e9 preparar um material leve mas resistente a \n\nimpactos. Foram preparados materiais comp\u00f3sitos utilizando a t\u00e9cnica \n\nconvencional que resultou  em amostras com lacunas. A nova t\u00e9cnica aqui \n\napresentada diminui consideravelmente este problema e os comp\u00f3sitos \n\npreparados com esta t\u00e9cnica tem quase dobro de resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica.    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nKeywords                                 \n \n \n \n \n \nabstract \n\nMechanical strength, metal-glass composite, microsphere , synthetic foam , \nfracture strength , modulus of rupture \n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this experimental study two different types of composite materials were \n\nprepared and their mechanical behavior was investigated. The first group \n\nconsists of porous material made from sintering a mixture of micron size glass \n\nand metal spheres. Though the porous compacts made from glass \n\nmicrospheres have been already investigated, the main aim of the present work \n\nis to study the effect of varying the proportion of the metal spheres on the \n\nmechanical strength of the final sintered porous material. The results presented \n\nherein show that mixing metal microspheres always results in diminishing of the \n\nfracture strength of the final material and the decrease is first proportional to the \n\nvolume ratio but after a certain percentage the material becomes very week; a \n\nprovisional explanation is suggested. The fracture path and surface in disc type \n\nspecimen broken under a flexural stress were also studied by optical \n\nmicroscopy. The second composite material studied consists of hollow metal \n\nspheres embedded in a polymer matrix; the general aim is to prepare light-\n\nweight armour for energy absorption under impact. Composites were made by \n\nmixing the millimeter size hollow aluminum spheres in a two-part epoxy and \n\nsubsequent thermal curing of the mixture. The tests on the cured samples \n\nshowed that they generally had many voids and the strength was low. An \n\nimproved procedure was devised that led to considerable reduction of voids \n\nand consequently an improvement in the strength.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nIndex \n\n \n\n1.

A Composite material is the combination of two or more materials, which takes the \n\nadvantage of the good characteristics of each of the materials. Two phase composite materials \n\nmainly consist of two separate components, the matrix and the filler. The matrix holds the filler \n\ntogether to form the bulk of the material.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1: The relative importance of metals, polymers, composites and ceramics as a function of \n\ntime. (Gibson R.F; 1994; 2)\n[1]  \n\nThe relative importance of metals, ceramics, polymers and composites in human life throughout \n\nthe history of mankind is indicated in the figure above. \n\n \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n1.1 Classification of two phase composite materials \n\nTwo distinct levels of classification of composite materials are possible. The first level of \n\nclassification is usually with respect to the matrix constituent. The major composite classes \n\ninclude \n\n? Organic Matrix Composite \n\no Polymer Matrix Composites  \n\no Carbon Matrix Composites \n\n? Metal Matrix Composites \n\n? Ceramic Matrix Composites \n\n? Hybrid Composites \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Classification of composite materials with metal matrix\n [2]\n\n. \n\nThe second level of classification refers to the reinforcement form, i.e. the geometric form of the \n\nfiller phase. Under this classification we have \u2013 fiber reinforced composites, laminar composites, \n\ninfiltration composites, particulate composites etc. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Classification of Reinforcement \n\n Particulate Composites consist of a matrix reinforced with a dispersed phase in form of particles. \n\nThe effect of the dispersed particles on the properties of the composite depends on the particle \n\ndimension. As an example, in one specific particulate composite, very small spherical particles \n\nwith 0.25 micron in diameter are distributed in the matrix\n [3]\n\n. \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Schematic presentation of three shapes of metal matrix composite materials\n [2]\n\n. \n\n  The composite have a list of benefits due to the good characteristics of each of the materials \n\npresent in it; some of the advantages are listed below\n [4]\n\n. \n\n? Cost : \n\n? Prototypes \n? Mass production \n? Part consolidation \n? Maintenance \n? Long term durability \n? Production time \n? Maturity of technology \n\n? Weight: \n\n? Light weight \n? Weight distribution \n\n \n\n? Strength and Stiffness: \n? High strength-to-weight ratio \n? Directional strength and/or stiffness \n\n? Dimension: \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n? Large parts \n? Special geometry \n\n \n\n? Surface properties: \n \n\n? Corrosion resistance \n? Weather resistance \n? Tailored surface finish \n\n1.2 Applications \n\n The composite materials are used for various applications that demand high strength, \n\nhigh stiffness, or low thermal conductivity. Many aerospace parts made from by metal were \n\nsubstituted with the composites. The special properties of these materials, for example, low \n\ndensity light make them suitable for from aircraft and spacecraft structures\n [5]\n\n to automotive and \n\ntrucks parts, from spacecraft components to printed circuit boards, sports equipment and health \n\ncare equipment. Various components made from composites used on Airbus series of aircraft are \n\ngiven in the table below. \n\n \n\nTable 1: The Composite components used in the Airbus series of aircraft. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n The porous composites, in which one of the constituent phases is void, possess interesting \n\nproperties like light weight, strength, resistance to thermal effects, chemical and thermal \n\nstability, low heat conductivity factor and many more\n [6]\n\n. The development in the thermal and \n\nmechanical properties of porous ceramic materials led to the design of air bearings for the \n\noptimization of high precision and high speed machines. Motor spindles for precision tool \n\nmachines required a constant air gap for steady properties even at highest rotation speeds. \n\nEnergy dissipation in drives and the air friction in bearings at high relative velocities lead to \n\nthermal displacement. Ceramic bearings reduce the thermal deformation to a minimum\n [7]\n\n.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5: Air bearing pad with porous ceramic \n[7] \n\n1.3 Two phase composite materials \n\n Any portion of a system that is physically homogeneous and bounded by a surface is \n\ncalled as a phase. A two phase material is one in which there are distinct constituents of the \n\nmaterial that have different chemical or physical structure. For example, bulk metallic glass is a \n\ntwo-phase  material with good mechanical, chemical and functional properties (such as soft \n\nmagnetism); the main problems, that limit their applications, are their brittle nature and poor \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nplasticity at room temperature and the lack of proper joining or integration technology\n[10]\n\n. In \n\ngeneral, two-phase composite porous materials are believed to have both light weight and good \n\nmechanical strength along with other interesting properties. In the experimental study described \n\nherein, glass and metal microspheres are employed to prepare porous composites and study their \n\nmechanical and structural properties as a function of composition.  \n\n1.3.1 Microspheres \n\n Microspheres are spherical micro particles; typically have a diameter ranging from 1 to \n\n1000\u00b5m. Microspheres are well known for their ability to deliver active materials in the \n\npharmaceutical and cosmetics industry\n [11]\n\n. The Microspheres can be manufactured from both \n\nnatural and synthetic materials. The spherical shape of the microspheres makes them different \n\nfrom other fillers in several aspects\n [12]\n\n. The Microspheres are used in many advanced materials \n\nand composites, in the healthcare and personal care industries, and in many specialty research \n\nand development applications. Microspheres come in two basic types, solid and hollow. The \n\nsolid microspheres commonly used as filler are generally of glass or ceramic. The solid glass \n\nmicrospheres are typically of soda lime glass due to its low cost, low melting temperature and \n\nproven chemical inertness.  \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Solid soda lime glass microsphere, mean diameter 70\u00b5m\n [13] \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n Hollow microspheres, also designated as balloons can be prepared of glass, ceramic, \n\ncarbon or polymers like polystyrene. Most commonly used hollow fillers are glass microspheres, \n\nusually has a size range from 10 to 200\u00b5m and their walls are usually 0.4 to 1.5\u00b5m thick. Hollow \n\nmicrospheres show lower strength and density compare to solid microspheres\n [12]\n\n. Solid glass \n\nMicrospheres are light weight, hard and smooth. They offer excellent chemical resistance, low \n\noil absorption and are used in automobile and electrical industry and also appear in household \n\nappliances, adhesives, packaging, paints and other materials used in construction industry. 3M \n\nCompany has produced a high isostatic compressive strength (200 MPa) glass microsphere with \n\ndensity of 0.6 g/cm\n3\n through innovative process and composition developments\n\n [14]\n. \n\n \n\n1.3.2 Factors influencing the mechanical properties \n\n Solid bodies obtained through sintering glass microspheres have useful characteristics of \n\nlarge porosity along with adequate mechanical strength. A large set of properties of the solid \n\nbodies through sintering glass microspheres can be described by the contact area between the \n\nadjacent spheres\n [15]\n\n.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Soda-lime glass beads of: (a) 1.5 mm sintered during 3 min (b) 3 mm sintered during \n\n3.5 min\n [16]\n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n In a study\n [16]\n\n about the sintering behavior of soda lime glass beads, it was proved that the \n\nsize of the beads has a direct influence in the sintering mechanism. The densification is faster \n\nwith the decrease of the diameter of the beads. Figure 7(a) shows a better contact than in figure \n\n7(b) where the contact is just tangential, showing increase in densification with decrease in \n\ndiameter. A graph in which relative density is drawn as a function of sintering time and size of \n\nthe beads is shown in the figure (8) below.  \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Evolution of density of soda-lime glass as a function of time and size of beads\n [16] \n\nFrom the figure (8) it is clear that the densification is faster for the smaller diameter soda lime \n\nglass beads. The densification provides the mechanical strength to the porous composite. The \n\nmechanism of densification is the viscous flow and the transition from low densification rate to \n\nhigh densification rate occurs over a narrow range of temperature\n [17]\n\n. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Contact area between spheres increases with sintering time and reduced sphere size \n\n The size of the pores decreases (densification) with increase in the sintering time and \n\nwith decrease in the diameter of the spheres used. As the size is small the surface energy is more \n\nwhich is the driving force for sintering and leads to densification by reduction in the pore size; \n\natomic diffusion into the pore results in reduced size of the pores. The stress concentration in the \n\nporous composite depends on the internal structure of the pores present in the material. The \n\nporosity is one of an important parameter in porous material while discussing its mechanical \n\nproperties\n [15]\n\n. The other parameters influencing the mechanical property during sintering porous \n\nmaterial are co-ordination number, neck radius and neck size\n [15]\n\n.  \n\n \n\n1.4 Epoxy based Composites \n\n Epoxy, chemically known as polyepoxide, is a thermosetting polymer obtained from \n\nreaction of an epoxide \u201cresin\u201d with polyamine \u201chardener\u201d. Epoxy resins are widely used in \n\nfilament-wound composites and are suitable for moulding purposes. They have a reasonable \n\nstability to chemical attacks and are excellent adherents with slow shrinkage during curing and \n\nno emission of volatile gases. However, the one used here, was to be not useful above a \n\ntemperature of 140\u00b0C. The three phase synthetic foams, also known as \u201cmultifoams\u201d or \n\n\u201cdiafoams\u201d are used in applications requiring low densities. The multifoams systems exhibit \n\ngood electrical properties and have low dielectric constant.  Macro sphere synthetic foam was \n\nprepared and investigated in this study.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10: Cross section of a three-phase synthetic foam system consisting of polymer matrix, \n\nhollow microspheres and voids \n\n \n\n Hollow metal Macro sphere and Biresin LS epoxy resin are used to develop a macro \n\nsphere synthetic resin for this study.  The plastic, glass or ceramic macro spheres commercially \n\navailable have diameters varying from 0.3 to hundreds of millimeters. Microspheres, whether \n\nsolid or hollow, show properties that are directly related to their spherical shape, in which the \n\nratio of surface area to volume is minimum. In resin rich surfaces of reinforced systems, the \n\nmicrospheres free of orientation and sharp edges are capable of producing smooth surfaces\n [18]\n\n. \n\nOne of the major advantages of synthetic foams is their ability to be designed and fabricated \n\naccording to the physical and mechanical property requirements of the application. \n\n  \n\n1.4.1 Factors influencing the Mechanical properties \n\n The mechanical strength of these multi-foams decreases with increasing gaseous void \n\nfraction; the gaseous voids do not contribute to the strength properties of the composites. The \n\nvoids in composite arise primarily because of air bubbles and volatile substances liberated during \n\ncuring. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11: Schematic representation of (a) two phase and (b) three phase structures of synthetic \n\nfoam \n\nThe voids have another negative influence on the mechanical properties of the synthetic foam. \n\nThe propagation of the crack during the mechanical testing is fast in the void region, leading to \n\nthe failure of the system with much less load.  \n\n \n\n1.4.2 Applications \n\n The products cast from these macro spheres can be very large (up to several cubic \n\nmeters) and are primarily used in marine flotation application such as offshore oil platform \n\nbuoyancy modules, pipeline pontoons and buoy hulls\n [12]\n\n. Light weight synthetic foams have \n\nbeen developed for a broad range of military and marine composite application. An ultra-light \n\nthree-phase structure composed of macrospheres in a rigid resin binder has been designed for \n\nblast containment. This foam is carefully designed to optimize energy absorption and offers a \n\nwell-defined crush stress and has a long constant stress plateau, key advantages for the design of \n\nlightweight crushable structure\n [19]\n\n. The primary function of this foam is for energy absorption, \n\ne.g., in protective barriers, infrastructure panels, pressure vessel testing and flyer plate backing \n\nmaterial. This synthetic foam is also an excellent lightweight, high specific property core \n\nmaterial\n [19]\n\n. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Ultra-Light three phase synthetic foam\n [19]\n\n \n\n \n\n1.5 Mechanical Behavior of composites \n\n The Mechanical properties reflect the response of a material subjected to an external \n\nforce. The strength of the material refers to the ability to resist loads without failure. In ductile \n\nmaterials the plasticity and fracture are controlled by plastic flow, which works by motion of \n\ndefects called dislocations. The plasticity and fracture of materials are more sensitive to the \n\nmaterial microstructure. The dislocations can be impeded by changing the microstructure (by \n\nalloying and heat treatment), makes material harder and reduce its toughness. In brittle materials, \n\nstrength and toughness depends on the flaws present in the material \n[20]\n\n.  The brittle materials are \n\nunable to withstand high tensile stresses. Fracture in brittle materials frequently originates at a \n\nsurface, and the strength is influenced by surface condition in conjunction with the internal \n\nmicrostructure rather than by internal microstructure alone\n [21]\n\n.  Standard test methods for \n\ndetermining the flexural strength of brittle materials are either uniaxial (e.g. three \u2013 or four-point \n\nbending of beams) or biaxial flexural tests (e.g. piston-on-ring, piston-on-three-ball and ring-on-\n\nring tests)\n [22]\n\n. Biaxial flexural strength tests have been widely accepted for evaluating the \n\nmechanical properties of thin brittle ceramic substrates.  \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13: Strength - Toughness Materials Selection Chart, showing the classes of engineering \n\nmaterials\n [20] \n\n \n\n1.5.1 Piston- on -three \u2013ball \n\n An ASTM standard test method for biaxial flexural Strength of ceramic substrates was \n\ndeveloped to determine the strengths of circular disks of brittle materials in 1978\n[21]\n\n .The \n\nInternational Organization for Standardization has selected Piston-on-three-ball tests to establish \n\nISO 6782 for dentistry-ceramic materials\n [22]\n\n. In spite of the fact that the stress under the piston is \n\nnon uniform, the advantage with this method is that the three balls support the specimen, \n\nallowing the use of a slightly warped specimen, and no surface grinding or polishing is required\n \n\n[23]\n. An analytical solution of piston-on-three-ball test has been derived by Kirstein and Wolley. \n\nSome of the parameters of piston-on-three-ball configuration are given in the figure 14 below. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14: Parameters in the piston-on-3-ball configuration: a= radius of the concentric support \n\ncircle, b=radius of the loaded area (radius of the piston), c= radius of the plate specimen, and     \n\n?i = ? \u2013 2 i/3 (i = 1, 2, 3)\n [23] \n\n \n\nThe biaxial fracture strength is higher along the path of the supporting balls compared to other \n\nregions in the specimen; the fracture is provoked by the tangential stress rather than the radial \n\nstress\n [24]\n\n. The biaxial flexure strength for the disc specimen is calculated using following \n\nequation \n[22]\n\n. \n\n                                                    \n2\n\n)(\n2387.0\n\nt\n\nYX\nPS\n\n?\n??  \n\n22\n\n2\n\n)1(\nln)1( ?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n??\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\nS\n\nACO\n\nS\n\nAC\nO\n\nR\n\nr\n\nR\n\nr\nX\n\n?\n?  \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n22\n\n)1(ln1)1( ?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n???\n\nS\n\no\n\nS\n\nO\nR\n\nz\n\nR\n\nz\nY ??  \n\nWhere S is the maximum tensile stress in MPa, P is the failure load in Newtons (N), O?

The Maximum \n\ntensile stress provides the highest stress used to resist the biaxial bending. A typical loading trace \n\nof the piston-on-3-ball experiment is given below in figure 15\n[23]\n\n. \n\n \n\nFigure 15: Typical Load vs Deflection graph of piston-on-3-ball experiment\n [23] \n\n1.5.2 Three point bending \n\n The 3-point-bend test is a simple test and is widely used to measure the strength of brittle \n\nmaterials. In three point bending test one measures the force required to bend a beam under 3 \n\npoint loading conditions. The simplicity of the test method makes it a very popular tool. The area \n\nstressed in three point bending test is smaller, and so there is less chance of stressing a large \n\nflaw, resulting in higher strength value of the sample\n [25]\n\n.  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16: Shear and Moment diagrams of a typical 3-point-bending\n [26] \n\n The maximum tensile stress developed in the beam before failure is determined using \n\nthree-point-bending formula. The formula used to calculate the modulus of rupture for a \n\nrectangular sample is given below. \n\n  \n\nModulus of rupture (M) =    \n\n \n\nWhere P is the breaking load, L is the length of the span, b is the average specimen width and d \n\nis the thickness of the specimen. During the loading process three types of failure are possible. \n\nFirst, a tensile failure may occur at the bottom of the beam, where the bending stress has the \n\nmaximum positive value. Second, a compression failure may occur at the top of the beam where \n\nthe bending stress has the maximum negative value.  \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17: Failure mode in three-point-bending\n [28] \n\n \n\nFinally, a shear failure may occur at the neutral axis of the beam where the shear stress is largest\n \n\n[27]\n. These failure modes are depicted in the above figure 17. \n\n In this study the mechanical behavior of two different composite materials is \n\ninvestigated. In the First composite material, glass microspheres are mixed with two different \n\nmetal alloy microspheres. Piston-on-three-spheres test was performed to study the variation of \n\nthe mechanical strength for different volume fractions of metal microspheres in glass-metal \n\nporous composite. The glass-metal microsphere powder was pressed to a disc and sintered and \n\nthe sintered discs were tested for their strength. The principal aim of the study is to investigate \n\nhow the strength of the composite varies with the volume fraction of metal spheres. For the \n\nsecond composite material, hollow metal macro spheres and Biresin LS epoxy resin are cured to \n\ndevelop light weight synthetic foam. Here, an improved preparation technique is sought for that \n\ncould reduce the amount of voids in order to have better mechanical strength.  Three point \n\nbending test was performed to determine the mechanical strength of the synthetic foam.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nChapter 2: Glass-metal microsphere porous material \n\n2.1 Material \n\nThe glass microspheres used in this study were supplied by Potters-Ballotini as \u201cA-glass\u201d, \n\ncommercially known as soda lime.

This occurs \n\naround 750\u00b0C for A-glass \n[2]\n\n. Solid glass microspheres from glass are most suitable for mixing \n\nwith plastics. These special microspheres are coated with a binding agent, which bonds itself as \n\nwell as the sphere\u2019s surface to the resin, which increases the bonding strength and basically \n\nremoves absorption of liquids into the separation between the spheres\n [7]\n\n.  The microspheres used \n\nin this study, however, are not treated for plastics.  \n\nTwo different metal alloy microspheres were used with glass microspheres to prepare the \n\ncomposite porous disc.

In this experimental study, the first set of \n\nsamples prepared are the porous solid discs from glass microspheres alone. A sequence of steps \n\nwere followed for the preparation: a homogeneous paste was prepared using glass microspheres \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nand polyethylene glycol, then the paste was pressed to obtain a disc shaped sample which was \n\ndried to provide the shape and initial strength, followed by a controlled sintering process to \n\nobtain the final shape and the mechanical strength.  \n\n2.2.1 Preparation of paste \n\n The glass microspheres with a size range of 150 -160 \u00b5m were separated using a sieving \n\nmachine. Polyethylene glycol was used as a binder, which was added in order to provide shape \n\nand initial strength to the glass-microsphere-discs. The polyethylene glycol was completely \n\ndissolved in absolute ethanol and kept inside the oven at 60\u00b0 for 30 min. A colorless solution was \n\nobtained after 30 min, which was then mixed with glass microspheres to obtain a paste. The \n\nmixed paste was placed inside the oven at 60\u00b0 for 18 hours to get a homogeneous mixture.  \n\n \n\nFigure 18: Preparation of homogeneous mixture of glass microsphere and polyethylene glycol \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nThe ethanol was evaporated from the paste mixture during this period inside the oven and a \n\nhomogenous coating of polyethylene glycol on the surface of the glass microsphere was \n\nobtained.  \n\n2.2.2 Pressing of paste \n\nThe homogeneous paste prepared above was pressed in a mechanical pressing machine to \n\nprepare disc shaped sample. Two grams of sample paste was placed in the pressing machine and \n\n2 tons of force for 1 min was applied to form initial disc. The paste was placed in between two \n\nmetal discs which were placed between a bottom support and a top piston. The total setup was \n\nplaced inside the pressing stand where the piston was placed beneath a load screw, which was \n\ntightened later. The valve on the right side of the apparatus was closed before applying the load. \n\nThe load was increased to 2 tons with the help of a hand lever by the side of the apparatus. The \n\nload was applied for 1 min and then the valve at the right side was opened to release the load. \n\nFinally the disc sample was removed carefully.  \n\n \n\nFigure 19: Mechanical pressing machine  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nThe metal discs of the pressing machine were cleaned with ethanol to prevent sticking of the \n\nglass microsphere disc samples with the metal discs.  \n\n2.2.3 Sintering process \n\nThe sintering process is an important step in the preparation process which provides mechanical \n\nstrength. The glass microsphere discs were placed inside the furnace on an alumina substrate. \n\nInitially the temperature was set to 300\u00b0 C for 30 min, during this period the polyethylene glycol \n\ndecomposes and then the temperature was increased to 640\u00b0C and kept for 24 hours. Afterwards \n\nnormal cooling was done by switching off the furnace.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20: Sintering Furnace \n\n2.3 Preparation of Glass-Metal Composite disc sample  \n\n In this preparation process different volume fraction of metal alloy microspheres (Cobalt alloy \n\nand Nickel alloy) were mixed with glass microspheres. Polyethylene glycol (15%) added with \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nethanol was used as a binder. In the first set of metal-glass composites different percentages by \n\nweight of glass and metal microspheres were used to prepare the sample. The metal alloys with \n\nweight percentage of 10, 30 and 50 were used to prepare the first set of samples. In the second \n\nset of preparation 2, 5, 7 and 10 percentage by volume of metal was mixed with glass \n\nmicrospheres to prepare the composite.  \n\n2.3.1 Preparation of paste \n\n \n\nFigure 21: Preparation of homogeneous mixture of glass-metal microsphere and polyethylene \n\nglycol \n\nThe colorless paste of polyethylene glycol and absolute ethanol mixture obtained after 30 min in \n\noven for 60\u00b0C was mixed with glass and metal microspheres. The mixture was then kept in a \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nlinear vibrator with a frequency of 50HZ for 2 hours to obtain a homogenous mixture. The paste \n\nobtained has a homogeneous coating of polyethylene glycol over glass and metal microspheres. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Pressing and sintering \n\nThe procedure of pressing and sintering was the same as that of glass microsphere.  \n\n \n\nFigure 22: Sintered samples of different percentage concentration of metal-glass microspheres  \n\nThe disc samples obtained were analyzed optically in a zoom microscope and then subjected to \n\nmechanical testing. \n\n \n\n2.4 Microscopic Analysis  \n\nThe microscopy image provides the information on the structure which in turn influences the \n\nmechanical properties.  The Microstructural analysis of these samples was done using Olympus \n\nILLC2 Microscope. The sample was placed in the sample holder and the magnification was \n\nstarted with the minimum range and then it was increased up to 64X.  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23: Olympus ILLC2 Microscope \n\n \n\nThe microscopic images of these samples were obtained in the computer using U-Eye Demo \n\nsoftware. The power was switched on and then USB cable from the computer was connected to \n\nthe microscope. After setting up the microscope the U-Eye Demo icon in the computer was \n\nselected, in which optimal color => open camera option was selected to view the image in the \n\ncomputer screen. The images are captured by clicking snapshot option and finally saved in the \n\nfolder. The microscopic images clearly show the state of bonding between microspheres. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24: Microstructure of sintered body of glass microsphere (64 x magnifications) \n\n \n\nFigure 25: Microscopic images of sample with 50% by weight of cobalt alloy microsphere in \n\nmetal-glass composite  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26: Microscopic images of 2% by volume nickel alloy microsphere in metal-glass \n\ncomposite  \n\n2.5 Mechanical strength testing Procedure \n\nThe mechanical strength of the sintered disc samples was determined using piston-on-three- \n\nsphere testing procedure. The apparatus for this experiment consist of a piston connected to the \n\nload unit of the Autograph machine and a sample holder with its support. The schematic \n\nrepresentation of the apparatus is given below. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27: Piston-on-three-sphere Apparatus \n\nThe disc sample was placed on the top of the three spheres in the sample holder. The load was \n\napplied on the center of the sample using the piston. The loading area of the piston is semi-\n\nspherical in shape. The machine used for the mechanical testing was Shimadzu, with a load cell \n\nof 5KN.  \n\n \n\nFigure 28: (a) Shimadzu Mechanical testing machine setup (b) Piston-on-3-sphere apparatus \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nThe machine parameters were set using the controller; the loading speed of the piston was given \n\nas 0.5 mm/s. After placing the sample disc in the sample holder, Autograph software was used to \n\nstart the testing. The applied load was not uniform due the roughness of the surface. The machine \n\nautomatically stops the testing when the disc sample is broken. The data obtained from \n\nmechanical testing was retrieved form the computer. Eight set of samples were tested for each \n\ncomposition of metal-glass composites.  \n\n2.5.1 Results  \n\nLoad versus deflection curve was drawn from the data obtained by mechanical testing. The \n\nmechanical strength of porous body obtained from glass microsphere was higher than that of \n\nmetal-glass microsphere composite. The load deflection graphs for different volume fractions of \n\nmetal in metal-glass composites are given below.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 29: Load vs. deflection of metal-glass composite with 2% volume of Cobalt alloy  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30: Load vs. deflection of metal-glass composite with 2% volume of Nickel alloy  \n\n \n\nFigure 31: Load vs. deflection of metal-glass composite with 5% volume of Cobalt alloy  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 32: Load vs. deflection of metal-glass composite with 5% volume of Nickel alloy  \n\n \n\nFigure 33: Load vs. deflection of metal-glass composite with 7% volume of Cobalt alloy  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 34: Load vs. Deflection of metal-glass composite with 7% volume of Nickel alloy  \n\n \n\nFigure 35: Load vs. Deflection of metal-glass composite with 10% volume of Cobalt alloy  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 36: Load vs. Deflection of metal-glass composite with 10% volume of Nickel alloy  \n\n \n\nFigure 37: Microscopic image of glass-cobalt composite (a) 5% by volume of Cobalt alloy (b) \n\n50% by weight of Cobalt alloy \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nThe Load vs. deflection figures clearly show that notwithstanding scatter in the data for the same \n\ncomposition, the mechanical strength goes down with increasing percentage of metal in metal-\n\nglass composite. The average maximum load for different volume fractions is given in the table \n\nbelow. As the amount of metal microspheres increases in the composite the total bonding \n\nbetween metal and glass microspheres was reduced causing low mechanical strength.  \n\n \n\nVolume \n\nPercentage \n\nOf metal \n\nalloy \n\n  \n\nMaximum Fracture strength(N)  \n\n \n\nAverage \n\nMaximum \n\nFracture \n\nStrength (N) \n\n2% Cobalt 71.55 \n\n \n\n71.025 \n\n \n\n82.55 \n\n \n\n73.675 \n\n \n\n47.475 \n\n \n\n56.35 \n\n \n\n54.925 \n\n \n\n63.05 \n\n \n65 \n\n2% Nickel 150.625 \n\n \n\n126.188 \n\n \n\n103.625 \n\n \n\n124.938 \n\n \n\n110.938 \n\n \n\n111.125 \n\n \n\n113.063 \n\n \n\n127.25 \n\n \n121 \n\n5% Cobalt 50.375 \n \n\n63.7 \n \n\n58.6 \n \n\n41.412 \n \n\n62.775 \n \n\n46.862 \n \n\n70.45 \n \n\n62.45 \n \n\n57 \n\n5% Nickel 123.563 \n\n \n\n128.25 \n\n \n\n123.688 \n\n \n\n115.5 \n\n \n\n119.938 \n\n \n\n134.625 \n\n \n\n114.625 \n\n \n\n124.438 \n\n \n123 \n\n7% Cobalt 48.225 \n\n \n\n41.475 \n\n \n\n56.775 \n\n \n\n56.575 \n\n \n\n58.65 \n\n \n\n54.575 \n\n \n\n61.225 \n\n \n\n50.025 \n\n \n53 \n\n7% Nickel 98.063 \n\n \n\n97.563 \n\n \n\n94.75 \n\n \n\n104.625 \n\n \n\n103.813 \n\n \n\n95.25 \n\n \n\n99.125 \n\n \n\n104.063 \n\n \n97 \n\n10% Cobalt 31.987 \n\n \n\n31.513 \n\n \n\n39.412 \n\n \n\n37.088 \n\n \n\n41.475 \n\n \n\n31.85 \n\n \n\n29.888 \n\n \n\n31.8 \n\n \n34 \n\n10% Nickel 91.5 \n\n \n\n94.475 \n\n \n\n95.125 \n\n \n\n92.875 \n\n \n\n95.05 \n\n \n\n82.95 \n\n \n\n102.438 \n\n \n\n97.063 \n\n \n94 \n\n  \n\nTable 5: Average Maximum fracture strength for various volume fraction of metal in metal-glass \n\ncomposite. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 38: Maximum Fracture strength for various percentage compositions of metal \n\nmicrospheres in the composite \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39: Microscopic image of metal-glass composite (a) 2% by volume of Cobalt alloy (b) \n\n2% by volume of Nickel alloy \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 40: Microscopic images of broken metal-glass composite after mechanical testing (a) 10% \n\nby volume of cobalt alloy (b) 10% by Volume of nickel alloy \n\n2.5.2 Discussion of the results:  \n\nFrom the data presented in the table and in curves following conclusions can be drawn: \n\n1. Introduction of metal spheres always decreases the strength indicating that the bond between \n\nmetal-glass spheres is weaker than the glass-glass spheres.  \n\n2. The reduction in the strength is more pronounced after a certain volume fraction (~10%) of \n\nmetal spheres.  \n\n3. For the same composition Ni alloy system is stronger than the Co alloy system.   \n\nMicroscope images of the fractured surfaces throw some light on the possible causes of the \n\nbehavior described above. The pictures clearly show that in metal-glass sphere system there is \n\nmuch less interfacial penetration than in the fused glass sphere case; in the later system at the \n\nsintering temperature used, the two contacting spherical surfaces fuse to produce a circular bond \n\narea of considerable diameter; this is the neck shaped growth between two glass microspheres. \n\n(Fig. 24 ). For the metal-glass case there is negligible mass diffusion from one sphere to other. A \n\nlarge decrease in the strength for more than critical metal percentage is probably due the reason \n\nthat at these large concentrations there are significant numbers of metal-metal contact paths \n\nwhich are the weakest non-bonding links for fracture propagation. Also, large metal \n\nconcentration diminishes the probability of contact and therefore fusion between glass \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nmicrospheres. The difference between the properties of Co and Ni system is probably also has to \n\ndo with the nature of metal-glass bond. Microscopic images (Figs 40) show that the surface of Ni \n\nspheres is less shiny and spotty leading us to believe that in this case there is a formation of thin \n\nporous film of NiO which then fuses with the surface of glass spheres. As a matter of fact \n\noxidizing the metal before sintering is well-known technique for improving the adhesion in \n\nglass-metal seals\n [28]\n\n.  \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nChapter 3: Hollow-metal-sphere Synthetic Foam \n\n \n\n3.1 Preparation of hollow-metal-sphere synthetic foam \n\n \n\nThe metallic hollow spheres used here were expanded polystyrol spheres with steel coating \n\nmanufactured by GLEICH GMBH (Dresden, Germany). The average diameter of the spheres \n\nwas 2.9 mm and the thickness of the shell was 70 microns. The apparent density of the hollow \n\nmetal spheres was 0.5206 g/cm\n3\n. Two different methods were used to prepare lightweight \n\nmaterial with hollow spheres embedded in a plastic resin: conventional method and an improved \n\nmethod.  \n\n3.1.1 Conventional Method: The metal spheres were spread inside a cardboard mold box and \n\nthen the resin was poured over the spheres. The resin was prepared by mixing 90% (by volume) \n\nof Biresin LS epoxy with 9 - 11% of hardener. The mixture was stirred carefully at room \n\ntemperature (18-25\u00b0C) to a homogeneous state. The resin wets the macro spheres effectively due \n\nto its low viscosity. The curing process was done by keeping the mold inside the oven for 2 \n\nhours at 80\u00b0C followed by a slow cooling process. The synthetic block thus obtained was cut to \n\nsmall rectangular shape blocks for mechanical testing.  The cutting was performed in a machine \n\nequipped with high speed cutting disc. The composite material is not very hard to cut due to \n\nsoftness of thin shell and plastic. While cutting the foam for preparing samples of required size \n\nfor strength measurement it was observed that there were many voids in the synthetic foam so \n\nobtained. Figure 41 shows the general aspect of the specimens cut for strength measurements and \n\nFigure 45 shows the voids in the specimens prepared by the conventional method. The density of \n\nthe samples obtained from conventional method was 0.4146 g/cm\n3\n.  \n\nA table top cut-off machine by Struers was used for cutting the specimen. The cutting head of the \n\nmachine was powered by a motor. A clamping device was provided for the fixation of samples. \n\nThe cutting head was lowered using an adjustable side lever and an external circulating coolant \n\nwas provided for lubrication. The samples were placed between the clamping device and cut into \n\nsmall rectangular bars. \n\n  \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 41: Cut samples of hollow macro sphere synthetic foam \n\n3.1.2 Improved Method: In order to avoid voids during preparation, we introduced a stainless \n\nsteel wire net in the mold and the net was kept fixed in the position while pouring the resin. The \n\nmesh size in the net is smaller than the diameter of the spheres and thus spheres cannot pass the \n\nnet while the liquid resin can pass. The net was placed over the spheres. Another change in this \n\nmethod is that after pouring the mixer of resin and hardener and filling the mould to cover the \n\nspheres and slightly over the net, the filled mould was left to cure at room temperature for 2-3 \n\nhours. This step reduces formation of large bubbles that happens when curing directly at high \n\ntemperature. After this initial curing at room temperature, the mould with the net was subjected \n\nto the same curing procedure as the conventional method. Specimens obtained by this improved \n\nmethod were found to have little or no voids and were denser. The density of the specimens was \n\n0.6433 g/cm\n3\n, higher than the specimens obtained from conventional method.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n3.2 Mechanical Strength testing procedure \n\n \n\nThe three point bending test was employed to determine the mechanical strength of synthetic \n\nfoam. The mechanical testing machine used for this testing was Shimadzu, in which a three point \n\nbending arrangement was mounted. The rectangular sample of synthetic foam was kept in such a \n\nway that the lower part of the specimen was provided with two supports and the load was applied \n\nat the top center of the sample. A photograph of the three point bending setup is shown below. \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 42: Three-point bending of Hollow millimeter size sphere Synthetic foam \n\n \n\nThe machine settings were done using the controller; the loading speed of the piston was set to \n\n0.5 mm/s. After placing the sample, Autograph software was used to start the testing. The \n\napplied load was not uniform due the roughness of the surface. The machine automatically stops \n\nthe testing when the sample is broken. The data obtained through mechanical testing was \n\nretrieved form the computer. The load vs. deflection curve was obtained for five samples.  \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n3.3 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\nThe load vs. deflection curves of the two sets (with voids and without voids) of samples prepared \n\nare given below (Graphs 10 and 11 respectively). The maximum flexural strength, modulus of \n\nrupture, of the samples was determined from the data using the standard formula:    \n\n \n\nFigure 43: Load vs. deflection of synthetic foam with voids \n\n \nLoad \n  (N) \n\n \nspan length \n\n(mm) \n \n\n \nBreadth \n\n(mm) \n\n \nDepth \n(mm) \n\n \nmodulus of  \n\nrupture \n(MPa) \n\n256 40 13.5 11.5 8.603 \n\n261 40 11.8 11.6 9.862 \n\n181 40 12.8 11.4 6.528 \n\n271 40 13.5 13 7.126 \n\n182 40 11.6 11.6 6.995 \n\n \n\nTable 6: Dimensions and modulus of rupture for synthetic foam with voids \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nWhere P is the breaking load, L is the length of the span, b is the average specimen width and d \n\nis the thickness of the specimen \n\n \n\nFigure 44 : Load vs. deflection of synthetic foam without voids \n\n \n\n \nload \n(N) \n\n \nspan length \n\n(mm) \n\n \nBreadth \n\n(mm) \n\n \nDepth \n(mm) \n\n \nmodulus of \n\nrupture \n(MPa) \n\n121 40 8.8 8 12.890 \n\n154 40 8.4 8.4 15.589 \n\n160 40 9 8.5 14.763 \n\n142 40 11.5 7 15.119 \n\n334 40 15 10 13.360 \n\n \n\nTable 7: Dimensions and modulus of rupture for synthetic foam without voids \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nThe data in the tables 6 and 7 clearly shows that the maximum flexural strength (modulus of \n\nrupture) for synthetic foam without voids, using the improved method, was about twice that of \n\nsynthetic foam with voids. The void reduces the cross-sectional area and acts as a failure \n\ninitiator. \n\n \n\nFigure 45: Hollow millimeter size sphere Synthetic foam with void \n\n The presence of voids increases the crack propagation diminishing the mechanical strength of \n\nsynthetic foam. Increasing void content reduces the flexural strength by acting both on the \n\ninitiation and propagation stages of failure. In the first set prepared by conventional method the \n\naverage modulus of rupture was 7.8 MPa, whereas the second set prepared by improved method \n\ngave 14.3 MPa as the average value for the modulus.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nChapter 4: Conclusion \n\nThe mechanical strength of two different composite materials was determined. The first porous \n\ncomposite material prepared from metal-glass microsphere was subjected to piston-on-three-\n\nsphere test to determine the maximum fracture strength. The strength diminished as the amount \n\nof metal microspheres in the metal-glass composite was increased. The bonding between metal \n\nand glass microsphere in the composite material was found to be different than between two \n\nglass microspheres. The increase in the amount of metal microspheres in the composite material \n\nreduces the bonding among the metal and glass microspheres. In the second composite, hollow \n\nmillimeter size metal spheres and an epoxy resin were cured to develop synthetic foam. The \n\nimproved preparation technique led to synthetic foam without voids. Three-Point-Bending test \n\nwas employed to calculate modulus of rupture of the synthetic foam. The mechanical strength of \n\nthe foam prepared from improved technique was two times higher than that of the foam prepared \n\nby the normal method.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n1, Filiz Civgin, \u201cAnalysis of Composite Bars in Torsion\u201d, Thesis Submitted to the Graduate \n\nSchool of Natural and Applied Sciences of Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University. 2005. \n\n2, Karl Ulrich Kainer, \u201cBasics of Metal Matrix Composites\u201d.
