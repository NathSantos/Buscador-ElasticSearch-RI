Desta forma, o objetivo principal deste estudo foi produzir \num gradiente de porosidade na superf\u00edcie de substratos de zirc\u00f4nia, \natrav\u00e9s da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o consecutiva de camadas com tamanhos de poros \ndiferentes - obtido pelo empacotamento de part\u00edculas esf\u00e9ricas de \ndiferentes tamanhos; a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de camadas homog\u00eaneas (somente um \ntamanho de part\u00edculas/poros) foi necess\u00e1ria a fim de se otimizar cada \nparcela precursora do gradiente. As deposi\u00e7\u00f5es foram feitas por dip \ncoating, utilizando suspens\u00f5es cer\u00e2micas de gr\u00e2nulos esf\u00e9ricos de \nzirc\u00f4nia (Z40, Z70 e Z100 \u2013 nomeados ap\u00f3s an\u00e1lise de tamanho m\u00e9dio \nde part\u00edcula, em \u00b5m) para formar diferentes porosidades. Os primeiros \nensaios testaram tr\u00eas condi\u00e7\u00f5es do p\u00f3 Z40: n\u00e3o tratado, pr\u00e9-sinterizado \n(1150\u00baC) e sinterizado (1500\u00baC); e posteriormente, a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de \npart\u00edculas finas (F) ao sistema, a fim de interferir na coes\u00e3o entre \npart\u00edculas maiores. A segunda parte dos testes considerou as outras duas \ncamadas (Z70 e Z100), com sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o de F otimizada, e a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o \nconsecutiva das tr\u00eas camadas para alcan\u00e7ar o gradiente de porosidade. A \nporosidade desejada foi obtida com o p\u00f3 precursor pr\u00e9-sinterizado, que \ngarantiu o formato esf\u00e9rico das part\u00edculas durante todo o processo; a \npresen\u00e7a de F produziu pontes de liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre part\u00edculas grossas, \naumentando a coes\u00e3o das camadas, influenciando diretamente em sua \nresist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica. O tratamento t\u00e9rmico entre imers\u00f5es (em camadas \ncom deposi\u00e7\u00f5es sequenciais) foi necess\u00e1rio para prevenir a perda de \nmaterial depositado para o meio aquoso. A presen\u00e7a das camadas \naumentou a resist\u00eancia \u00e0 flex\u00e3o dos substratos puros de zirc\u00f4nia; suas \nespessuras (ou o n\u00famero de imers\u00f5es), por\u00e9m, n\u00e3o foram relevantes na \nmelhoria da resist\u00eancia. O gradiente de porosidade mostrou-se vi\u00e1vel de \nser produzido, com potencial para ser aplicado em pr\u00f3teses de zirc\u00f4nia, \ntanto para modifica\u00e7\u00e3o superficial como para impregna\u00e7\u00e3o com \ncomponentes medicamentosos. \n \nPalavras-chave: zirc\u00f4nia, dip coating, camadas porosas, FGM. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \nThe present study was conducted to present a route to obtain surface \nporosity on zirconia substrates, using a layer-by-layer deposition process \nfor the production of controlled porosity systems, to be primarily \napplied on zirconia prostheses. The goal of the development was to \nmimic natural structures, such as bones and teeth, both presenting \nstructural gradients to perform different roles: stimulate growth of new \nbone tissue and/or osteointegration, or act as interface between \ndissimilar components. Thus, the main objective of this study was to \nproduce a gradient of porosity on the surface of zirconia substrates \nthrough consecutive deposition of layers with different pore sizes \u2013 \nobtained by the packing of spherical particles of different sizes; \nproduction of homogeneous layers (only one particle/pore size) was \nneeded in order to optimize each precursor portion of the gradient. The \ndepositions were made by dip coating, using ceramic suspensions of \nzirconia spherical granules (Z40, Z70 and Z100 \u2013 named after particle \nsize, d50, in \u00b5m) to form different porosities. First tests were made with \nZ40 powder under three conditions: untreated, pre-sintered (1150\u00b0C) \nand sintered (1500\u00b0C); followed by addition of fine particles (F) to the \nsystem to investigate improvement of cohesion among large particles. \nThe second part of the tests considered the other two layers (Z70 and \nZ100), with optimized F content, and the consecutive deposition of all \nlayers to reach the porosity gradient. The desired porosity was obtained \nwith the pre-sintered precursor powder, which ensured the spherical \nshape of the particles throughout the whole process; the presence of F \nguaranteed cohesion between coarse particles, enhancing mechanical \nproperties of the layers. Heat treatment between immersions (on \nsequential deposited layers) was necessary to prevent loss of deposited \nmaterial into the aqueous medium. The presence of layers increased \nflexural strength of pure zirconia substrates; however, its thicknesses (or \nnumber of immersions) were not relevant on the resistance \nimprovement. The porosity gradient was feasible to be produced, with \npotential to be applied in zirconia prostheses, both for surface \nmodifications and/or impregnation of medical components. \n \nKeywords: zirconia, dip coating, porous layers, FGM. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\n \nFigure 2.1 - Structural comparison of a natural tooth and a metal-\n\nceramic implant. ................................................................................................28 \nFigure 2.2 - Schematic representation toughening mechanism of \n\nzirconia, by t?m transformation on a induced crack. .......................................31 \nFigure 2.3 - Schematic representation of partially t?m transformation of \n\nzirconia grains, and how tensile stress is introduced into the microstructure on \nLTD phenomenon. .............................................................................................32 \n\nFigure 2.4 - Portion of the phase diagram of ZrO2 \u2013 Y2O3 system. .....33 \nFigure 2.5 - Schematic difference on packing of two particle size \n\ndistributions. ......................................................................................................37 \nFigure 2.6 - Schematic illustration of FGM transitions: (a) continuous, \n\nand (b) discrete \u2013 by layers. ...............................................................................38 \nFigure 2.7 - Examples of nature\u2019s FGM microstructures: (a) bamboo, (b) \n\nmollusc, shell, and (c) tooth enamel. .................................................................38 \nFigure 2.8 - Internal gradient porosity configuration of a human bone. .39 \nFigure 2.9 - Possible configurations of porosity gradient: (a) block, (b) \n\nblock with dense layer, (c) disk with dense layer, and (d) cylinder with dense \ncore. ...................................................................................................................40 \n\nFigure 2.10 - Illustration of deposited porous layers with gradient pore \nsizes. ..................................................................................................................41 \n\nFigure 2.11 - Schematic illustration of dip coating process, and its steps.\n ...........................................................................................................................41 \n\nFigure 2.12 - (A) Driving forces acting on deposition;

INTRODUCTION \n \n\nThe idea to produce a gradient of porosity on the surface of dense \nzirconia arose from the need to improve adherence between zirconia \n(core) and porcelain (surface) of dental crowns, which often cracks due \nto a weak interface. The structural function of the gradient would act for \ninterpenetration of porcelain, to form a gradual transition of materials. \nTo develop the gradient, a layer-by-layer technique was chosen for the \nadvantages of good control of layer\u2019s microstructures. This concept has \nbecome attractive for its applicability in several areas and materials. \n\nThe dip coating process is effective in this procedure for its \neasiness, low cost and a good control on characteristics of the deposited \nlayers. Spherical particle packing concept was used for porosity \nobtainment, in which the interstices form the voids of the system. The \nmain challenge of this procedure was to optimize ceramic suspensions \nand powders conditions to promote the desired porosity (content and \nmorphology of pores). \n\nIn order to reach the objective of building a gradient of porosity, \nwere investigated the mechanical behavior and morphologies of the \ndeposited homogeneous layers \u2013 single particle size \u2013 then, the attention \nwas driven to the successive deposition of three (different particle sizes) \nhomogeneous layers, ascending the order of sizes.  \n\n \n1.1. OBJECTIVES \n\n \nIn this way, the broader aim of this work was to build a gradient \n\nof porosity through successive depositions of homogeneous layers of \ndifferent particle sizes, while specific aims were to obtain homogeneous \nporous layers of zirconia to study each one by its mechanical behavior, \ninterconnectivity of pores and particularities.  \n\nThe development of porous surfaces of zirconia over dense \nsubstrates of the same material was interesting basically for two reasons: \nfirst, for zirconia being widely used in the biomedical field, composing \ndental and orthopedic prostheses; and second, for rough surfaces \nallowing better osteointegration, besides the potential interpenetrating \nstructure that permits its combination with a second material, forming a \nFGM. \n \n  \n\n23\n\n\n\n \n \n\n1.2. STRUCTURE OF THE STUDY \n \nThe study consists of five chapters that include the present \n\nIntroduction, with a broad approach to the themes addressed. \n In Chapter 2, a review of literature is presented, which intends to \n\npresent the properties and characteristics of biomaterials, most focused \non zirconia based materials; the importance of porous structures and \nsuperficial graded porosity (FGM\u2019s); and finally, a summary of the dip \ncoating method as a way to build the layer-by-layer structure, and how \nthe involved forces act in the packing of particles, achieving the \nexpected porosity.  \n\nChapter 3 encompasses an article that focuses on the study of the \nrequired conditions to produce porous layers with the particle size of \nZ40 (d50 = 40 \u00b5m), and the optimized route to obtain proper cohesion \nand adherence of the layers.  \n\nChapter 4 embraces the second article, which uses the studied \nconditions (of the previous chapter) to produce layers using other \nparticle sizes (Z70 and Z100), and then, to apply all by successive \ndepositions, in order to obtain gradient of porosity.  \n\nAppendix A shows the trial of different heat treatments on the \ninterval of dipping. \n\nAppendix B contains a few images of the porous solids produced \nto obtain porosity measurements of the layers. \n\nAt last, Appendix C presents the defects of structures during \nprocessing.  \n\n \n  \n\n24\n\n\n\n \n\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n \n2.1. BIOMATERIALS \n \n\nAccording to Williams, biomaterials can be defined as natural or \nsynthetic substances that intend to interact with biological systems, to \nsubstitute partially or totally tissues, organs or functions of the body \nwith the mean of keeping or increase life quality of the patient, without \nstimulating any adverse biological response to the host. Function and \ndurability within the body vary considerably according to the need of \neach application and composition of introduced material (WILLIAMS, \n2009). \n\nCardiovascular and orthopedic prosthesis, dental implants and \nmedical devices are some of many examples of applications in different \nbiomedical areas. Products that, besides offering mechanical support \nfunctions, also stimulate growth of new tissues and/or have controlled \nrelease drug systems, are among central themes of current researches of \nbiomedical engineering, to provide a faster and more efficient healing to \nthe patient (RATNER et al., 2013).   \n\nMetals, polymers and ceramics/glass, and all their respective \nfeatures, can be used within human body. Those are generally classified \nby its biological response; materials that show no interaction with body, \nand retain its structure after implantation, are called bioinert; those \nwhich promote bonds with living tissue are called bioactive; and those \nwhich are degraded and replaced by regenerating natural tissue, are \ncalled biodegradable. \n\nBiological responses are directly influenced by the surface of \nbiomaterials and medical devices. Chemical and structural conditions of \nthe surface enable bone growth, improve wear and corrosion resistances, \nand affect the long-term of implant, among others. Coatings or even \nchanges on original surface might promote an increase in performance \nand biointeraction of clinic products, without modifying initial design \nand function, or need of retraining medical staff. Surfaces can be \nmodified by three main processing methods: chemical deposition, \ncoating or physical modification (etching, mechanical roughening) \n(RATNER et al., 2013). \n\nImplants can mix different compositions in the same product, in \norder to attend different mechanical request along a body or improve \nsuperficial response. The main objective is to reproduce the functions of \nthe natural material that will be replaced. Proper fixation to soft tissues \n\n25\n\n\n\n \n \n\nis important to achieve high resistance to mechanical loadings, and \neventually promote tissue-growth. \n\nOsteointegration is the term applied for lamellar bone attachment \nto implant without intervening in fibrous tissue. It is required to reduce \noccurrence of stress shielding (from unequal load distribution between \nimplant and bone) that leads to weakening of the host bone (MEHRALI \net al., 2013). Bone ingrowth occurs inside a porous surface; it requires \npore size range of 50 to 400 \u00b5m, and percentage of voids of 30 to 40% \nto preserve mechanical strength (KHANUJA, 2011). Growth rate is \ninfluenced by pores size and interconnectivity of pores; on the other \nhand, it is not affected by pore shape (RATNER et al., 2013).  \n\nTherefore, the presence of porosity is considered an advantage for \nbiomaterials, needed in many applications. In contrast, porosity acts as \nsource of crack propagation, restricting selections of materials and \nprocessing conditions (JAMALUDIN et al., 2015).  \n\nCeramic materials are intrinsically linked to porosity. Combined \nto advanced ceramic properties, it becomes an excellent option to \nperform as biomaterial, particularly on orthopedic and dentistry fields. \nCeramic components are mainly found in total joint arthroplasties \n(TJA), coatings on implants and devices, and dental restorations \n(MCENTIRE et al., 2015).  \n\nGreat part of products used in this class of materials are \ncomposed by alumina, hydroxyapatite (HA), glass-ceramics and \nzirconia; and resorbable compositions include calcium sulfate, \ntricalcium phosphate and calcium-phosphate salts (RATNER et al., \n2013). Hydroxyapatite is a calcium-phosphate ceramic, with similar \ncomposition of bone and dentin minerals. Known for being \nosteoconductive \u2013 that induces formation of new bone tissue \u2013, it\u2019s the \nmost \u201cfamous\u201d bioceramic used on substitution of bone tissues, bone \ngrafts and teeth (OLIVEIRA, 2010). Alumina is the pioneer of ceramic \nbiomaterials for its well-known mechanical properties; it is bioinert and \nresistant to corrosion at in vivo environments. Glass-ceramics have \nbecome known as bioactive ceramics, allocated on implant\u2019s surface to \ncreate an adherent interface that withstands high mechanical stresses \n(RATNER et al., 2013). And zirconia is the one with best mechanical \nproperties, perfect to load-bearing applications. Its bright color also \nenables it to be applied on dentistry, adjusting composition to match the \nteeth color of the patient.  \n\nThe interest for all-ceramic implants has grown with the \ndevelopment of new processing technologies and with favorable clinical \nobservations. For example, the need of cement in metallic implants to \n\n26\n\n\n\n \n\npromote fixation has brought biological problems related to wear debris; \nthis leads to development of all- ceramic cementless implants, with \nimproved design, increased durability and most recommended to young \npatients, who request higher mechanical loads and longer useful life \n(PETSATODIS et al., 2010; KHANUJA, 2011). On dentistry, \nadvantages of metal-free implants increase all-ceramic systems demand, \nby aesthetical improvement and lower biological response (MIYAZAKI \net al., 2013).  \n\n Thus, the selection of biomaterials and its manufacturing \ntechniques must consider function, interaction expected to host body, \nand also the environment that it will be applied. All conditions can cause \nstructural changes on material and compromise its efficiency (RATNER \net al., 2013). \n\n \nDental materials \n\n \nThe progress on aesthetic aspects of artificial teeth has brought \n\nloss of mechanical strength due to fragile nature of ceramic materials. \nAdaptions on compositions turn adversities into suitable properties of \ndental restorations, withstanding different conditions of humidity, pH, \ncyclic loadings, among others. \n\nAll-ceramic implants conquered dentistry with products of good \nmechanical properties, resistance to oral environment, competitive price, \nand good aesthetics, favorable factors for the complete replacement of \nmetals on oral implants. Compositions can vary depending on design of \nimplant, for being necessary different characteristics in each place of the \npiece. Generally, core structures are made with polycrystalline ceramics \nwith higher strength, such as zirconia and alumina, while superface \ncovering consist of porcelain and/or glass to achieve pleasing aesthetics \n(KELLY; BENETTI, 2011). \n\nIts combination with metals provides dental implants with \nexcellent properties but unwanted aesthetic effect. So, the last three \ndecades were crucial for dentistry to develop technologies for \nproduction of all-ceramic systems, such as hot-pressing, slip-casting \nand, the most recent, CAD-CAM (Computer Aided Design-Computer \nAided Machining) (DENRY; HOLLOWAY, 2010). \n\nDental implants are generally composed of three main parts, as \nshown in Figure 2.1: (a) the central structure fixed to the gum tissue, \nplaying the role of tooth root; (b) the core structure, an abutment \nattached to the fixed structure, associated with pulp and dentin; and (c) \nthe crown, the outer part of the tooth. Thus, each part has the specific \n\n27\n\n\n\n \n \n\nfunction of replacing certain structure of the tooth. Structure (a) is \ncommonly made of metal for being easier to machine, but there are also \noptions of ceramic models. Structure (b) is generally made of zirconia \nbased ceramics, due to its mechanical resistance. And the last structure \n(c) is composed by a mix of zirconia and porcelain and/or glass, with \nfunction of aesthetic finish and protection of aggressive conditions of \nmouth. \n\n \nFigure 2.1 - Structural comparison of a natural tooth and a metal-ceramic \nimplant. \n\n \nSource: Dental implants, 2017.  \n \n\nReplacement of dental crowns should reproduce structural \ntransition from dentin to enamel. It is important to emphasize that \ntransition between both materials must be sufficiently consolidated to \navoid detachment during use (BARANI et al., 2012). A wide range of \nsurface modifications is used in dental implant, from structural changes \n(mentioned in previous chapter) to adding material (adhesives, sealants, \netc.). This process guarantees consolidation of two or more materials \n(ZHANG; KIM, 2009). \n\nTransition between substructures shall be made with absence of \nstress zones derived from mismatch on mechanical or thermal properties \non contact of different materials. Natural tooth show a distribution of \nproperties along its extension, which can help on support of mechanical \nstresses. In addition, clinical cases verified that abrupt transition of \n\n28\n\n\n\n \n\nstructures (b) and (c) could be the reason of early failures on dental \nimplants, by detachment of those two materials (BARANI et al., 2012). \n\nIn this way, many techniques are being studied in order to soften \nthis transition by creating a functionally graded material (FGM\u2019s), for \nexample, in order to mimetize nature with its capability of stress \ndistribution (ZHANG; KIM, 2009).  \n\nSome variables can affect performance, reliability and useful life \nof implants, including intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors \ninclude amount of crystalline phase, which varies from 35 to 99% vol., \nsize and geometry of crystals, mismatch of Young\u00b4s modulus and/or \nthermal coefficients between core and surface; also processing \nconditions play a fundamental role on the control of its microstructures. \nExtrinsic factors are the aggressive environment of mouth, including \ngreat variation on pH, temperature, humidity and loads \u2013 cyclic and \npeak loads \u2013, that expose materials to degradation and corrosion on \ncontact with humidity even at low temperatures. Mechanical \ncharacterization under humidity and cyclic loading is necessary to attest \nquality and reliability of products (LAWSON, 1995; KELLY, 1999). \nOral adversities can be the major cause of early failure of dental \nimplants (DENRY; HOLLOWAY, 2010). \n\nHowever, crystallinity is only one of the factors that contribute to \nmaterial\u2019s performance. Crystal\u2019s size and geometry, modulus of \nelasticity, phase transformation and compatibility of thermal expansion \ncoefficients (among dissimilar materials) are also responsible for their \nperformances (DENRY; HOLLOWAY, 2010). \n\nIn the quest to minimize defects originated in interfaces within a \nstructure, development of all-ceramic pieces has gained space in the \nmarket, with zirconia as the main protagonist, in the YSZ form, playing \nthe role of both implant (1) and abutment (2). But aesthetic finishing \nrecovering are still needed in dental crowns. Therefore, some studies \nturn their attention to this interface, in an attempt to create ideal \nconditions for a healthy transition. At this point, concepts of FGM \n(discussed in chapter 2.4) showed interesting designs to solve this issue. \n\n \n2.2. ZIRCONIA \n \n\nSuccess of zirconia ceramics was due to a combination of \nstrength, toughness and chemical resistance, allowing it to be used in \napplications on harsh environments and under severe loading conditions. \nStudied since 1960\u00b4s, this material is extensively used as thermal barrier \ncoating (TBC) in gas and jet turbine engines, membranes in solid oxide \n\n29\n\n\n\n \n \n\nfuel cells (SOFC), optical coatings, security devices, knife blades and \ncutting tools, oxygen sensors, biomedical devices, among others (LUO \net al., 1998).  \n\nThe zirconium oxide, with formula ZrO2, has three possible \ncrystalline arrangements: monoclinic (m) structure at room temperature, \ntetragonal (t) structure for temperatures from 1170\u00b0C to 2370\u00b0C and \ncubic (c) structure for up to 2370\u00b0C, with melting point at 2716\u00b0C. \nDuring cooling, transformation t?m is accompanied by a volumetric \nexpansion of 3 to 5%, which generates stress on microstructure that \ncould lead material to fracture; but it\u2019s also the key for toughening \nmechanisms. The discovery that addition of elements could control \nstructures and/or phase transformations on zirconia based ceramics has \nsparked the interest in scientific community for its similarity with steel \nalloys, both exhibiting martensitic transformation at relative low \ntemperatures, used to enhance strength and fracture toughness at \ncontrolled compositions. For this reason, zirconia alloys were also \nknown as \u201cceramic steel\u201d (HANNINK et al., 2000). \n\n So, the use of small amounts of stabilizers has become very \ncommon to keep metastability of tetragonal and/or cubic phases (high-\ntemperature phases), at room temperature. Different oxides are used to \nstabilize partially or totally those phases; generally, alkaline earth \noxides, such as CaO and MgO, are used for partially stabilized zirconia \n(PSZ), while Y2O3 and CeO2 are used for stabilization of t phase, such \nas tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZP), and cubic phase, fully \nstabilized zirconia (FSZ). These systems are usually named associated \nwith added component (ex.: Mg-PSZ, Y-TZP, etc.) (KELLY; DENRY, \n2008). \n\nThe toughening mechanism on TZP systems occurs on fine grains \nof metastable t phase that transform by cooling at temperatures lower \nthan 25\u00b0C or is induced by stress, in regions around a hardness \nindentation or surrounding the tip of a crack (Figure 2.2). Volumetric \nexpansion of the grains blocks crack propagation and prevent forming \nnew cracks. Modifications on microstructure occurs locally on presence \nof stress, where is visible some m laths between t grains (predominant). \nIn PSZ systems, metastable t phase with lenticular grains are precipitate \nin a stable c phase matrix. The metastable phase can transform \nspontaneously in m from rapid cooling of high temperatures, and under \na stress field (HANNINK et al., 2000).  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n30\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 - Schematic representation toughening mechanism of zirconia, by \nt?m transformation on a induced crack. \n\n \nSource: LUGHI; SERGO, 2010. \n\n \n This mechanism has become so well known that use of zirconia \n\nbased ceramics has been easily diffused in medical and dental areas by \nits efficient mechanical performance, replacing metal alloys on many \ndevices. In 2001, a setback has slowed the production of zirconia \nmedical products due to failures of 400 implanted devices in a short \nperiod, occurred by aging of the microstructure in contact with body \nfluids. This episode was due to a change on the process parameter on a \nfactory of zirconia prostheses. At that time, thousands of zirconia \nprostheses had already been implanted around the world, especially in \nthe USA and Europe, which have brought concerns about \nstandardization of implant materials. This episode has put zirconia \nmomentarily in check for \u201cinside-body\u201d applications, until studies \ndisrupted functioning and effects of aging mechanisms (CHEVALIER, \n2006).  \n\nThis phenomenon, also called low thermal degradation (LTD), is \ndefined by the spontaneous t?m transformation at low temperatures, \nwithout influence of any local load. The contact with water induces \ntransformation of t grains, which expansion provokes uplift on the \n\n31\n\n\n\n \n \n\nsurface and pushes the untransformed grains around, creating a stress \nfield (Figure 2.3-b). But micro cracks may appear from displacement of \nm grains, facilitating the entry of water into the structure, and thus, \nincreasing amount of m grains that tend to peel off from structure \n(Figure 2.3-c). The effects of aging include loss of mechanical \nproperties, density and toughness, accompanied by macro and micro \ncracks and increased m phase content. The intrinsic factors that \ninfluence LTD\u2019s susceptibility are: type and amount of stabilizer, grain \nsize and residual stresses (LUGHI; SERGO, 2010; PICONI, C., 2011). \n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Schematic representation of partially t?m transformation of \nzirconia grains, and how tensile stress is introduced into the microstructure on \nLTD phenomenon.  \n\n \nSource: LUGHI; SERGO, 2010. \n\n \n\n32\n\n\n\n \n\nDespite all efforts to prevent this phenomenon, zirconia cannot be \nconsidered an aging-free material since transformation is a natural \ntendency to monoclinic equilibrium state. But kinetic of transformations \nare strongly influenced by microstructure, which, in turn, is affected by \nsmall amounts of additives. \n\n \nYttria stabilized zirconia \n\n \nAddition of yttria to zirconia causes microstructural changes that \n\nallow its performance in different fields due to its chemical inertness, \nthermal stability and high ionic conductivity at high temperatures. \nDepending on added amount, phase diagram varies temperature of m, t \nand c phases transformations, as seen at its phase diagram in Figure 2.4; \nand consequently varies its main characteristics by its microstructure. \n\nZirconia ceramic with 8% mol. yttria is among most used \ncommercial zirconia \u201calloys\u201d. It is considered a FSZ for its predominant \ncubic phase structure, with increased stability at high temperatures. Any \ncomposition with cubic phase at beginning of firing, and intact structure \nat room temperature, can be considered \u201cfully stabilized\u201d. Cubic \nzirconia has a very low thermal conductivity, desired property for \nthermal coating barriers (TBC); also shows high ionic conductivity for \noxygen at high temperatures, used as fuel cell membranes (MARTIN, \n2011). \n\nThe substitution of Z4+ for Y3+, on charge stabilization of yttria-\nzirconia mixture, creates oxygen vacancies that act on stabilization of \ntetragonal and cubic phases, but also increase ion conductivity. Addition \nbetween 4 and 10% mol. of yttria results in a favorable proportion for \nion conductivity. \n\nThe TZP has predominant tetragonal phase in its structure, \nstabilized with 2 \u2013 4% mol. of yttria, with small crystal grains associated \nwith improved strength, fracture toughness and resistance to wear and \naging. It\u2019s prone to toughening mechanism that increases its fracture \nresistance, able to be applied as a structural material. It has been seen in \nindustrial parts and everyday products, such as ceramic knives (KELLY; \nDENRY, 2008), but it is on biomedical field that has been gaining more \nspace. Medical applications of Y-TZP include surgical tools, \ninstrumentation, surgical implants, orthopedic (femoral ball-heads), \nwhile dental applications include full and partial coverage crowns, \northodontic brackets, implant abutments, veneers, extracoronal \nattachments, among others (VAGKOPOULOU et al., 2009). \nFigure 2.4 - Portion of the phase diagram of ZrO2 \u2013 Y2O3 system. \n\n33\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nSource: AZO, 2017. \n\n \nCommercial zirconia is often produced with binders and other \n\nadditives that facilitate its processing, and guarantee non-incidence of \naging. Its good mechanical characteristics combined with toughening \nmechanism and biocompatibility, have made it the main competitor of \ntitanium, used in biomedical load-bearing applications, and overcome \nproperties of alumina, as shown in (Table 2.1). \n\n \n  \n\n34\n\n\n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Mechanical properties of Y-TZP, titanium and alumina. \nProperties Titanium Y-TZP Alumina \n\nDensity (g/cm\u00b3) 4.51 6.00 3.97 \n\nElastic Modulus (GPa) 110 206 300 \n\nCompressive strength (MPa) 240 \u2013 550* 800 \u2013 1300 2100 \n\nHardness (kg/mm\u00b2) 23 1000 \u2013 1400 1000 \n\nFracture toughness (MPa.m\n1/2\n\n) 70 6 \u2013 15 3.5 \n\n* Tensile strength (Source: PCI; Tosoh Co.) \n \n2.3. POROUS STRUCTURES/POROUS CERAMICS \n \n\nPorous structures have already been considered problematic from \na mechanical point of view, with limited applications. Over time, \nporosity has become known to be associated with thermal insulation, \nacoustic properties, permeability and increased surface area, brought the \ninterest of new fields of applications and development of porous \nmaterials (COLOMBO; SCHEFFER, 2005). \n\nAll classes of materials have examples of porous structures; \ncellular properties of both are influenced by the same set of factors, \nwhich include: (i) mechanical properties of (dense) material; (ii) amount \nand morphology (shape and size) of pores; (iii) connectivity of pores; \nand (iv) relative density. These factors will dictate the mechanical, \nelectrical and thermal properties of the final piece (COLOMBO; \nSCHEFFER, 2005). \n\nAccording to IUPAC, porous structures are classified by the \naverage pore size range: microporous to &lt;2 nm; mesoporous 2 to 50 \nnm; and above 50 nm, macroporous (PERKO, 2012). Interconnected \npores, also known as open porosity, composes fluid (liquid or gas) \ntransport structures, like scaffolds and others biomedical applications, \nfilters and catalyst supports; while pores that are not connected with \nothers, called closed porosity, are very common on thermal insulators, \nsuch as refractories, kiln furnitures and heat exchangers. Thus, \ninterconnectivity of pores influences thermal properties of materials \n(WERR, 2014). \n\nThe combination of porous structures and ceramic materials \nresults in low density, high stiffness and low specific heat bodies. These \n\n35\n\n\n\n \n \n\ncharacteristics are essential to technological applications like filters for \nmolten metals and hot gases, and biomedical devices. A variety in shape \nand distribution of pore form several structures such ceramic foams, \nhoneycombs and hollow spheres (COLOMBO; SCHEFFER, 2005). \n\nAmong many processing routes to obtain porous ceramics, there \nare: the use of sacrificial templates, use of narrow particle size \ndistribution and controlled sintering stage. Sacrificial templates are \nwidely used for porous solids fabrication, using incorporated \ncomponents in the ceramic matrix to produce the pore structure, through \nits removal by thermal treatment. It is also very common the use of gas \nas pore former agent, introduced into ceramic suspension/slurry and \nremoved after solidification of the body; its morphology determines size \nand shape of pores. Generally, formation of pores by this method occurs \nthrough formation of foams, consolidated by sintering, requiring \nadditives as surfactants, turning it to complex systems (STUDART et \nal., 2006; WERR, 2014).  \n\nSintering considers work with different temperatures to reach a \nproper diffusion rate. Ceramics generally follow a specific densification \ncurve; first, the increase of temperature induces volumetric diffusion, \nthat creates necks among particles, called as pre-sintering stage; and \nafter that, higher temperatures lead to higher diffusion rates, increasing \ndensification and shrinkage of material. Depending on diffusion, it can \ncontrol porous systems (WERR, 2014). \n\nThrough the control of particle size distribution of ceramic \npowder, it\u2019s possible to predict its packing density. For example, \nunimodal distributions of spherical particles, with narrow range of sizes, \nhave lower density in its packing arrangement. The space between \nspheres is large enough to not collapse during sintering ( \n\nFigure 2.5), forming pores with controlled size by controlling heat \ntreatment steps (WERR, 2014).  \n\nIn this mechanism, a previous consolidation on ceramic powder \nsurface may be necessary in order to prevent closed porosity during \nsintering of the body. \n\nPorous films manufacturing techniques are being developed to \nenable surface modifications of technological products. These \nmodifications are important to increase superficial areas, create \ninterfaces, and stimulate external responses in contact with another \nmaterial and/or tissue. Dip coating, slip and tape casting are methods \nthat use ceramic suspensions on formation of porous membranes, with \ncontrolled range of porosity and thickness. Other techniques are used to \n\n36\n\n\n\n \n\npromote partial densification, pore orientation and heterogeneous \ndistributions of voids along a section. \n \nFigure 2.5 - Schematic difference on packing of two particle size distributions. \n \n\n \n\nSource: WERR, 2014. \n \n \n2.4. FGM \n \n\nFunctionally graded materials (FGM) combine two or more \ndissimilar materials by a gradient transition of structure, composition \nand/or morphology along a section, resulting materials with adequate \nproperties distributed along a body, to attend different mechanical \nneeds. A soft transition helps to improve adherence and decrease \nmismatch of mechanical, thermal and even chemical properties \n(MEHRALI et al., 2013).  \n\nIncorporation of two, or more, component\u2019s function in the same \nbody is the main objective of this class of materials, using artifices as \nvariation of composition, porosity, geometry and physical state as a \nmanner to obtain the mixture of functions (MIYAMOTO et al., 1999). \nThe transition may occur continuously or discretely, in layers format ( \n\nFigure 2.6). The first one is widely observed in nature, while the \nsecond, in laboratories. Replications are not always an easy task, and \ncreation of artifices is often necessary to achieve the goal. The difficulty \nto reproduce continuous transition attracted attention to layer deposition \ntechniques, as dip coating, tape casting, chemical vapor deposition \n(CVD), among many others, to recreate structures discretely. Dense \nlayers between porous ones are still characteristic of FGM (UDUPA et \nal., 2014).  \n\nA great number of nature structures with some gradation of \nproperty along the body served as example to create and develop this \n\n37\n\n\n\n \n \n\nmaterial concept. Among them are the bamboo, shells, teeth and bones \n(Figure 2.7) all of them with gradual structures according to \nenvironmental conditions and mechanical request (MIYAMOTO et al., \n1999). \n \nFigure 2.6 - Schematic illustration of FGM transitions: (a) continuous, and (b) \ndiscrete \u2013 by layers. \n\n \n\nSource: MIYAMOTO et al., 1999. \n \nFigure 2.7 - Examples of nature\u2019s FGM microstructures: (a) bamboo, (b) \nmollusc, shell, and (c) tooth enamel.  \n\n \n\nSources: Adapted from MIYAMOTO et al., 1999. \n \n\nThe increasing interest on biomaterials with functional gradient \nallows the advancement and applicability in different biological \nbranches: photosynthesis, self-cleaning and self-healing materials, \ncontrolled-release drug systems, implants, among many others. Soft \ntransitions are often found in surface areas by coatings; this concept \nenables surface modifications of medical devices and implants, \nimproving its interaction with body fluid, acting as chemical shield, \nincreasing surface area, or even for aesthetic finishes. An option to \npromote those characteristics is by surface porosity; a way to reproduce \nnature and improve efficiency of existing products is by creating a \n\n38\n\n\n\n \n\ngradient of porosity, which improves structural conditions of material to \nserve as an interface with another (MARTIN, 2011).   \n \n\nGradient porosity \n \n\nIn the human body, several structures with heterogeneous \ndistributions of pores are seen, as the case of bones which surface is \ndenser than its nucleus undergoing a gradual porosity transition (Figure \n2.8). That configuration, also called sandwich structures, leads to an \nincreased bending resistance when compared to a solid beam. Porosity \ngradient on biomaterials are also attractive to improve interaction \nbetween dentin and enamel, on dentistry (MEHRALI et al., 2013). \nInterconnectivity of pores may act as an organizer of vascular channels, \nensuring supply of blood and nutrients to the bone (MIAO; SUN, 2009). \n\nHeterogeneity of porosity (size and amount), composition and \nmechanical properties may result in structural, biological and \nmechanical optimization of porous biomaterials. The gradient of pores \ncan further induce \u201cguided\u201d growth of new tissues and cells (MIAO; \nSUN, 2009). This configuration also reduces residual thermal stresses \non contact between dissimilar materials, leading to early fracture of \nproducts (MANICONE et al., 2007). \n\n \nFigure 2.8 - Internal gradient porosity configuration of a human bone. \n\n \n\nSource: University of Cambridge, 2017. \n \n\nExamples of basic shapes that vary porosity content along a \nsection can be seen in Figure 2.9. This structure configures a specific \narrangement of the so-called functionally graded materials (FGM\u2019s), \nbecause it changes its properties over a zone. \n\n \n\n39\n\n\n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.9 - Possible configurations of porosity gradient: (a) block, (b) block \nwith dense layer, (c) disk with dense layer, and (d) cylinder with dense core.  \n\n \n\nSource: Miao &amp; Sun, 2009. \n \n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, the gradient can be \nmade continuously or by discrete configurations. Continuous transitions \ntechniques are usually more expensive and require complex equipments, \nsuch as freeze-casting, spark plasma sintering (SPS) and electrospraying \n(into a template); while others, which result in discreet layered gradient, \nare usually cheaper but may take longer to be produced, due to the need \nfor multiple depositions. Techniques for discrete porous gradient \nstructures are: sintering of graded particles, multiple tape casting or dip \ncoating, and slip casting. Figure 2.10 represents consecutives \ndepositions of layers, with distinct pore sizes, forming a graded structure \n(MIAO; SUN, 2009).  \n\nTo produce porosity in layer deposition methods, there are two \nmain routes: introduction of pore formers, such as polymers or foams, to \nbe eliminated by firing at relative low temperatures and controlled \nheating rates (in order to avoid cracks generated from the extraction of \nthe component); or by particle size control, so that porosity comes from \ninterparticle voids formed during its packing, as discussed in chapter \n2.3.  \n\n \n  \n\n40\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 - Illustration of deposited porous layers with gradient pore sizes. \n\n \nSource: Miao &amp; Sun, 2009. \n \n \n2.5. DIP COATING \n \n\nDip coating is a deposition process that uses simple mechanism \nof attraction to retain particles on a given substrate \u2013 cappilarity. The \ntechnique basically consists of immerging vertically a porous substrate \nin a suspension containing precursor powder, to form a film of particles \nadhered on substrate\u2019s surface via capillary pressure (BRINKER, 2013). \nThe process can be divided into four main stages: (1) immersion and \ndwell time, (2) deposition, (3) drainage and (4) evaporation. \n\n \nFigure 2.11 - Schematic illustration of dip coating process, and its steps. \n\n \nSource: Royal Society of Chemistry, 2017. \n \n\nThe thickness is controlled according to process parameters, such \nas speed of withdraw, temperature and atmosphere; and chemical, such \nas dilution and solvent. A certain dwell time is necessary to guarantee \ncomplete wetting of the substrate during coating, which may difficult by \nhigh surface tension of solvents (GROSSO, 2011). \n\n41\n\n\n\n \n \n\nDeposition stage depends on suspensions characteristics, such as \nsolid content, particle size, additives, and on substrate\u2019s structure, such \nas porosity and pore size. During withdrawal of the substrate, the \nupward movement drags the penetrated liquid into pores, while outer \npart returns to the bath, draining excess liquid from the surface (Figure \n2.12-A). Evaporation phase completes film deposition cycle, while a \nsubsequent heat treatment is often necessary to eliminate organic \nresidues and/or promote crystallization of functional oxides (BRINKER, \n2013). \n\nThis method showed to be very attractive due to its simplicity, \neasiness access, regular control of thickness, waste-free, and low energy \nassociated. Its drawbacks are basically related to drying, when excessive \nretraction of thick layers may provoke cracks.  \n\nWithdraw speed influences on thickness by two different \nregimes: draining, on high speeds (> 10 mm.s-1); and capillary, under \nultra-low speed (&lt;0,1 mm.s-1). This trend is represented by graph \nbelow (Figure 2.12-B) where thickness increases on both extremes of \ngraphs, with an intermixed regime between 0.1 and 10 mm.s-1, ideal for \nthin layers fabrication. The dilution of the medium causes a downward \nshift of the curve.  \n\nEquation 1 (Figure 2.12-C) represents the sum of both regimes \nresulting the curve (B) below; capillary term can be described as the \nevaporation rate divided by speed (E/u) \u2013, and draining regime, solution \ncharacteristics times speed (Du2/3). So, thickness is dependent on a \nsolution composition constant ki, withdraw speed u, evaporation rate E, \nsubstrate width L, and physical-chemical characteristics of solutions D. \nBoth regimes are counterbalanced by evaporation (GROSSO, 2011).  \n \nFigure 2.12 - (A) Driving forces acting on deposition; (B) thickness versus \nwithdraw speed and the three regimes of deposition; and (C) thickness equation, \nconsidering dependence of deposition regimes. \n\n \nSource: Adapted from (GROSSO, 2011). \n  \n\n42\n\n\n\n \n\nCapillary pressure on porous substrate is responsible for particles \nto concentrate at the substrate-suspension interface and, thus, forms a \nfilm, since particles cannot \u201cpenetrate\u201d further in the solid. It represents \na very strong driving force to densify depositing film, and can be \nestimated by mathematical approaches. \n\nThe medium containing precursor material, may be in the \naqueous form, emulsion form or, the most applied of them, in sol-gel \nform. That is because sol-gel, and other chemical solution depositions \n(CSD), in some cases, increase wettability of substrates and improve \nfilm formation ability (KOZUKA et al., 2012). Nowadays, a wide range \nof technological applications uses sol-gel processes on coatings, such as \nsensor and actuators, superconducting layers, protective coatings, \npassivation layers, among others; therefore, many studies have already \ndisrupted sol-gel mechanisms (BRINKER, 2013). However, other \nsystems do not have the need for additives to improve processes \nconditions; for these, aqueous based processes can be a simpler and \ncheaper choice.  \n\nStructural control of deposited layers depends on factors related \nto suspensions (or emulsions, sol-gel, etc.) and process parameters, \nalong with precursor material characteristics. Among them are: solid \ncontent and viscosity of suspension, speed and time of immersion, and \nproperties of powder. Particle size has an important role on thickness \ncontrol. The range of thickness obtained by dip coating varies in 100 nm \nto 100 \u00b5m, just as pores size, depending on precursor powder and \nprocessing conditions.  \n\nMathematical and/or computational models are very effective \ntools for prediction and control of dimensional and structural parameters \nof formed membranes, although there are some restrictions about tubular \nshapes, since it involves complex mathematics about radial flows (GU; \nMENG, 1999). \n\nThe dip coating has been applied in dentistry since 1990\u2019s, to \ninfiltrate vitreous material on a ceramic infrastructure (pre-sintered), \ncreating a two-component structurally interconnected material \n(DENRY; HOLLOWAY, 2010). This type of structure, as mentioned \nbefore, avoids defects related to residual stress of different thermal \nproperties contact; it can also enhance restoration\u2019s ability to withstand \nmechanical loads. \n\nThe use of ceramic precursors allows deposition of porous and \ndense films by this method. The interest in ceramic membranes reaches \nseveral areas: electrical, electronics, biomaterials and energetic are a \nfew. YSZ plays a key role in applications such electrolyte films for solid \n\n43\n\n\n\n \n \n\nfuel cells (SOFC) and filtration membranes, and also on orthopedic \nimplants, due to their good biocompatibility and bone ingrowth property \n(LENORMAND et al., 2005; MIAO et al., 2007). \n\nThe processing in industries is normally made with special \nequipment to control process parameters, such as speed and immersion \ntime. In this way, process conditions are standardized, with controlled \nthickness and layer structure. \n\nIt is very common the use of additives to form pore structures, by \nfoam production and subsequent pyrolysis to exterminate residue \nmaterials. Techniques with aqueous suspension dismiss the need of a \ngreat number of those additives, but dispersant is an essential \ncomponent of ceramic slurries. It prevents agglomeration of particles, \nensuring homogenization of the system; and also affects viscosity, \ngenerally very important to determine process parameters. \n\n \nParticles packaging factors/mechanisms \n \nPacking arrangement of particles plays a decisive role in \n\ncontrolling porous systems. It is affected by few factors, such as: \n? Particle size distribution; \n? Particle\u2019s morphology; \n? Particle\u2019s density; \n? State of dispersion; \n? Processing of conformation. \n\nMonodispersion arrangements, which considers a unique size of \nspherical particles, such as atomic structures for example, predicts \npacking factors of 0,60 and 0,64, reaching up to 0,74 in ordered \nstructures (CFC). Spherical particles, besides possible to predict its \nbehavior, reach higher packaging densities when compared to non-\nspherical, as shown in Figure 2.13 due to friction during conformation \nthat produce voids among particles. Therefore, grading curve and \nparticles morphology have effect on densities arrangements.  \n \n  \n\n44\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2.13 - Relative packing density as a function of particle\u2019s morphology \nand size.  \n\n \n\nSource: OLIVEIRA, 2000.  \n \n\nMonodispersions are considered discrete distributions of particles \nwith a single size in the system; a rare situation at industrial field. \nUnimodal distributions exhibit a unique average size of particles; \nbimodal, two different average sizes; and multimodal, more than three \npeaks of average sizes. Those curves can be narrower or wider, or even \npresent discontinuities, such as small gaps with absence of a certain \nparticle size. \n\nFigure 2.13 shows the packing density of bimodal distributions of \nspherical and non-spherical particles. The peak of maximum density of \nboth curves is reached by similar volume fraction of coarse powders, not \ndepending on its format. However, bimodal distributions may exhibit \ndifferent particle shapes; the higher amount of non-spherical particles, in \nrelation to a mixture containing both types, the greater tendency to \nproduce porosity, as shown in Figure 2.14. \n\n \n  \n\n45\n\n\n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.14 - Porosity of a mixture as a function of relation between angular and \nspherical particles. \n\n  \n\nSource: OLIVEIRA, 2000.  \n \n\nInternal porosity of particles also implies a lower packing density, \nsince they can show close pores (like hollow) or open pores (like \nclusters). Sharp difference in particle\u2019s densities of bimodal distributions \ncan generate heterogeneous density in a product during its conformation, \ncompromising mechanical performance and/or reliability. Sharp \ndifference on pore sizes of a system may lead to the \u201cwall effect\u201d, that \nhappens when fine particles interact with coarser ones as if they were \nalmost plane, like a wall. This phenomenon is even greater when the \ncoarser powders present porosity, attracting them by capillarity (Figure \n2.15). \n  \n\n46\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2.15 - Illustration representation of low density packing due to \u201cwall-\neffect\u201d.  \n\n  \n\nSource: Adapted from OLIVEIRA, 2000.  \n \nThe manufacturing method can use dry and wet routes. The \n\ndifference between them is presence of water, associated with greater \nmobility of particles. Dry routes, as pressing, can increase low packing \nlevels; while wet routes, which includes suspensions, are often subjected \nto capillary forces while depositing on a face (dip coating, slip casting, \netc.). Each of these methods has certain influence on particle\u2019s \ncompaction, with the last one showing lower (and random) packing \nlevels. When fluid media are part of the process, the state of dispersion \nmust be considered to maximize packaging (CASTRO; \nPANDOLFELLI, 2009). \n\nDue to many factors that contribute to packaging, mathematical \nmodels has described density behavior of mixtures using different size \ndistributions of powders. There are two basic concepts: Furnas model, \nwhich its individual particles approach; and Andreasen\u2019s model, with its \ncontinuous distributions approach. Further studies concluded that both \nconcepts express the same idea, by different visions; so, a mathematical \nconvergence brought together both concepts into a single equation, \nknown as Alfred\u2019s model (eq. 2).  \n\n \n\n     ( )     (\n     \n\n \n\n  \n \n  \n\n \n ) Eq. (2) \n\n \nwhere CPTF is the \u201ccumulative percentage finer than\u201d D \u2013 particle \ndiameter; DL is the diameter of largest particle and DS, the smallest; \nand q is the distribution\u2019s coefficient. Computational simulations have \n\n47\n\n\n\n \n \n\nverified that values of q lower than 0,37 might promote maximum \npacking, while higher values leads to a residual porosity. The \ndistribution coefficient is affected by amount of fine particles; the \ngreater the quantity of fine particles, the smaller the value of q. \n\nHowever, increase fine particles (~1 \u00b5m) fraction may interfere \non size distribution. The tendency to agglomeration is by increase of \nrelation between surface area and volume, for small particles, that \nincreases interparticular cohesive forces. Its presence tends to inhibit \nspatial coordination of higher packing densities, thus, increases void \nvolume (CASTRO; PANDOLFELLI, 2009). \n \n \n2.6. CURRENT TECHNIQUES \n \n\nAlong this section, several production techniques of \nhomogeneous and graded porous structures have been introduced. A \ncomparison of currently used techniques is presented (Erro! Fonte de \nrefer\u00eancia n\u00e3o encontrada.), relating porosity, pore size obtained in \neach referenced work, and the need of pore-forming agents, which \nincreases time of production due to its removal.    \n\nThe references that made porous structures by the dip coating \nmethod (first lines) used raw materials with particle sizes below 5 \u00b5m. \nWith zirconia, the largest pore size was 60 \u00b5m produced with particles \nof unspecified size, while alumina, the maximum was 190 \u00b5m, both \nwith high porosity (%).   \n\nMethods such slip casting and gel casting are mainly used for \nporous solids production, that is, solids with similar dimensions (not as a \nlayer). Tape casting, widely used in the production of layers, was seen \nonly in cases of average pore size of 2.5\u00b5m. The tape casting and gel \ncasting papers have studied production of porosity by addition of pore \nformer agents.  \n\nPowder metallurgy is cited  for being related to mechanisms of \nspherical particles packing, in this case, using particles of great \ngranulometry (> 180 \u00b5m) to form structures with varied pore sizes \n(gradual transition). The main difference between this and the present \nwork, lies in the physical properties of the raw materials (metal vs. \nceramic) and its behavior during sintering.  \n\nVacuum casting was used to obtain large pore sizes, between 300 \nand 500 \u00b5m, burning expanded polystyrene for its formation. \nEletrophoretic deposition (EPD) and electrohydrodynamic spraying \n(EDS) are methods based on the addition of sacrificial materials, and are \n\n48\n\n\n\n \n\nattractive for allowing production of varied pore sizes. On the other \nhand, this information was extracted from reviews from both methods, \nand its possibilities of applications; for this reason, many processing \ndetails have been omitted in these documents. The full articles are not \navailable on free research platforms. \n\nThe present panorama highlights a lack on studies of zirconia \nmacroporous structures processing. In this context, the present work \nintends to insert an inexpensive and simple alternative to obtain surface \nmacroporous structures. \n  \n\n49\n\n\n\n  \n\nM\ne\nth\n\no\nd\n\n \nM\n\na\nte\n\nr\nia\n\nl \nd\n\n5\n0\n\n \n\n(\u00b5\nm\n\n) \nP\n\no\nr\ne\n f\n\no\nr\nm\n\ne\nr\n \n\nP\no\nr\no\nsi\n\nty\n \n\nP\no\nr\ne\n s\n\niz\ne\n \n\n(\u00b5\nm\n\n) \nA\n\np\np\n\nli\nc\na\n\nti\no\nn\n\n \nA\n\nu\nth\n\no\nr\n(s\n\n) \n\nD\nip\n\n \nco\n\nat\nin\n\ng \n\nZi\nrc\n\non\nia\n\n \n5.\n\n0 \nPa\n\nrt\nic\n\nle\ns \n\npa\nck\n\nin\ng \n\n58\n%\n\n \n0.\n\n9-\n15\n\n.5\n \n\nFi\nltr\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nm\n\nem\nbr\n\nan\ne \n\nM\nai\n\na,\n D\n\n.F\n. \n\n(2\n00\n\n6)\n \n\nZi\nrc\n\non\nia\n\n \n0.\n\n15\n a\n\nnd\n \n\n0.\n80\n\n \nPa\n\nrt\nic\n\nle\ns \n\npa\nck\n\nin\ng \n\n30\n a\n\nnd\n 4\n\n2%\n \n\n&lt;\n2.\n\n0 \n \n\nFi\nbr\n\ne-\nm\n\nat\nri\n\nx \nin\n\nte\nrf\n\nac\ne \n\nB\nla\n\nes\ne,\n\n D\n. \n\n(2\n01\n\n3)\n \n\nZi\nrc\n\non\nia\n\n \n* \n\nD\nec\n\nah\nyd\n\nro\nna\n\nph\nth\n\nal\nen\n\ne \n(E\n\nD\nH\n\n) o\nil \n\n(e\nm\n\nul\nsi\n\non\n) \n\n&lt;\n83\n\n.7\n%\n\n \n60\n\n \nT\n\nhe\nrm\n\nal\n in\n\nsu\nla\n\ntio\nn \n\nSa\nnt\n\nos\n, D\n\n.S\n.F\n\n. \n(2\n\n01\n5)\n\n \n\nZi\nrc\n\non\nia\n\n-T\nita\n\nni\na \n\n&lt;\n0.\n\n1 \nPa\n\nrt\nic\n\nle\ns \n\npa\nck\n\nin\ng \n\n11\n-2\n\n5%\n \n\n0.\n1-\n\n0.\n4 \n\nE\nle\n\nct\nro\n\nde\ns \n\nfo\nr a\n\nir\n \n\nm\non\n\nito\nri\n\nng\n \n\nSi\nlv\n\na,\n S\n\n.A\n. \n\n(2\n01\n\n5)\n \n\nA\nlu\n\nm\nin\n\na \n0.\n\n6 \nSu\n\ncr\nos\n\ne \n70\n\n%\n \n\n19\n0 \n\nB\nio\n\nm\nat\n\ner\nia\n\nls\n \n\nC\nam\n\nilo\n, C\n\n.C\n. \n\n(2\n01\n\n0)\n \n\nSl\nip\n\n c\nas\n\ntin\ng \n\n3Y\n-T\n\nZP\n \n\n10\n \u2013\n\n 8\n0 \n\nC\nor\n\ne-\nsh\n\nel\nl p\n\nar\ntic\n\nle\ns \n\n(n\nan\n\no)\n \n\n30\n%\n\n \nN\n\nan\no \n\nD\nen\n\nta\nl m\n\nat\ner\n\nia\nls\n\n \nPe\n\nrk\no,\n\n S\n. \n\n(2\n01\n\n2)\n \n\nA\nlu\n\nm\nin\n\na \nA\n\nPC\n \n\n0.\n3 \n\n\u2013 \n95\n\n.0\n \n\nPa\nrt\n\nic\nle\n\ns \npa\n\nck\nin\n\ng \nV\n\nar\nie\n\nd/\n \n\nG\nra\n\nde\nd \n\n 0\n.1\n\n-0\n.7\n\n \nPo\n\nro\nus\n\n g\nra\n\ndi\nen\n\nt \nso\n\nlid\ns \n\nM\nat\n\nia\ns,\n\n E\n.M\n\n. \n(2\n\n00\n7)\n\n \nT\n\nap\ne \n\nca\nst\n\nin\ng \n\n3Y\n-T\n\nZP\n \n\n0.\n15\n\n \nSt\n\nar\nch\n\n \n(5\n\n0 \n\u00b5m\n\n) \n31\n\n.4\n%\n\n \n0.\n\n15\n-1\n\n0 \nB\n\nio\nm\n\nat\ner\n\nia\nls\n\n \nA\n\nlb\nan\n\no,\n \n\nG\nar\n\nri\ndo\n\n (2\n01\n\n2)\n \n\nG\nel\n\n c\nas\n\ntin\ng \n\n3Y\n-T\n\nZP\n \n\n0.\n6 \n\nPo\nly\n\net\nhy\n\nle\nne\n\n (P\nE\n\n) \n(1\n\n25\n-3\n\n00\n \u00b5\n\nm\n) \n\n40\n-5\n\n0%\n \n\n2.\n5 \n\nN\no \n\nsp\nec\n\nif\nic\n\nat\nio\n\nns\n \n\nT\nul\n\nlia\nni\n\n e\nt a\n\nl \n(2\n\n01\n1)\n\n \n\n50\n\n\n\n  \nPo\n\nw\nde\n\nr \nm\n\net\nal\n\nlu\nrg\n\ny \nsi\n\nnt\ner\n\nin\ng \n\nT\nita\n\nni\num\n\n \n18\n\n0 \n- \n\n10\n00\n\n \nPa\n\nrt\nic\n\nle\ns \n\npa\nck\n\nin\ng \n\n35\n-\n\n60\n%\n\n \nG\n\nra\nde\n\nd \nB\n\nio\nm\n\nat\ner\n\nia\nls\n\n/F\nG\n\nM\ns \n\nT\nhi\n\nem\ne \n\net\n a\n\nl \n(2\n\n00\n1)\n\n \n\nV\nac\n\nuu\nm\n\n c\nas\n\ntin\ng \n\n3Y\n-T\n\nZ\nP \n\n0.\n26\n\n \nE\n\nxp\nan\n\nde\nd \n\npo\nly\n\nst\nyr\n\nen\ne \n\n(E\nPS\n\n) \n(1\n\n,4\n0 \n\n\u2013 \n2,\n\n95\n \u00b5\n\nm\n) \n\n51\n - \n\n69\n%\n\n \n30\n\n0 \n\u2013 \n\n50\n0 \n\nPo\nro\n\nus\n \n\nso\nlid\n\ns/\nFG\n\nM\ns \n\nM\nia\n\no \net\n\n a\nl (\n\n20\n07\n\n) \n\nE\nle\n\ntr\nop\n\nho\nre\n\ntic\n \n\nD\nep\n\nos\niti\n\non\n (E\n\nPD\n) \n\nA\nlu\n\nm\nin\n\na \n* \n\nPa\nra\n\nff\nin\n\n o\nil \n\n(e\nm\n\nul\nsi\n\non\n) \n\n* \n* \n\nN\no \n\nsp\nec\n\nif\nic\n\nat\nio\n\nns\n \n\nN\nei\n\nri\nnc\n\nk \net\n\n a\nl \n\n(2\n00\n\n9)\n1  \n\nE\nle\n\nct\nro\n\nhy\ndr\n\nod\nyn\n\nam\nic\n\n \nsp\n\nra\nyi\n\nng\n (E\n\nD\nS)\n\n \nZ\n\nir\nco\n\nni\na \n\n0.\n5 \n\nPo\nly\n\nur\net\n\nha\nne\n\n (P\nU\n\n) \nte\n\nm\npl\n\nat\ne \n\nV\nar\n\nie\nd \n\n10\n - \n\n50\n0 \n\nB\nio\n\nm\nat\n\ner\nia\n\nls\n \n\nM\nut\n\nhu\nta\n\nnt\nri\n\n e\nt a\n\nl \n(2\n\n00\n8)\n\n \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n \n1  E\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\ned\n\n fr\nom\n\n th\ne \n\nre\nvi\n\new\n (\n\nB\nO\n\nC\nC\n\nA\nC\n\nC\nIN\n\nI e\nt a\n\nl.,\n 2\n\n01\n0)\n\n. \n* \n\nno\nt i\n\nnf\nor\n\nm\ned\n\n. \n\n51\n\n\n\n \n \n\n3. Optimized route for the production of zirconia structures \nwith controlled surface porosity for biomedical applications   \n \n3.1. INTRODUCTION \n \n\nCeramic materials based on yttria stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) \npresent excellent mechanical properties, and are increasingly used in \nbiomedical field due to their biocompatibility. High values of strength \nand fracture toughness characterize its use in orthopedic prostheses and \ndental implants, especially as core structures to withstand the higher in-\nservice mechanical stresses (KELLY; DENRY, 2008).  \n\nToughening mechanism of zirconia, involving martensitic phase \ntransformations, allows the material to suppress propagation of cracks, \nattractive for many technological and \u201cinside-body\u201d applications that \nrequire a good mechanical reliability and high resistance at different \nenvironments. The mechanism is activated under stress, for example at \nthe tip of a crack, that induces transformation of tetragonal phase \n(metastable) to monoclinic (stable at room temperature), accompanied \nby a volumetric expansion of the grains enabling closure of the crack \n(HANNINK et al., 2000; VAGKOPOULOU et al., 2009).  \n\nBiomaterials often require the presence of porosity, either in the \nbulk or at the surface of a body. Studies have shown the increasing \ndemand for cement-free implants, which improves bone integration by \nthe presence of a rough surface that induces bone growth in contact with \nthe natural tissue (PARK; LAKES, 2007). The porosity is also \nrecommended in prostheses, to a better  distribution of stresses to the \nadjoining bone, thus minimizing the overload episodes and avoiding \nstress-shielding resultant from significant elastic differences between the \nprosthesis and bone (HEDIA; MAHMOUD, 2004). Different \narrangements of porosity, pore size and its interconnectivity enable the \ndevelopment of various biomimetic structures (MIAO; SUN, 2009). \n\nThe layer-by-layer deposition process can be used to elaborate \nstructures with different thicknesses and features throughout a \ntransversal section. The production of multi-layered parts may result, for \ninstance, in functionally graded materials (FGM), known to attach \ndifferent features in a single part (MEHRALI et al., 2013). In the case of \nbiomaterials, the production of FGMs with porosity gradients is one of \nthe current research targets that tend to mimic natural bones structures, \nthus combining a porous core with a denser surface (MIAO; SUN, 2009; \nMUTHUTANTRI, 2009).  \n\n52\n\n\n\n \n\nAmong the available routes used in the production of ceramic \nlayers, the dip coating process has the advantage of being an efficient, \nsimple and inexpensive method (GROSSO, 2011). The process consists \nin immerging the substrate to coat (porous or dense) into a ceramic \nsuspension and then withdrawn from it after a certain immersion time.  \nThe capillary pressure is then regarded for the formation of a wet \nceramic coating over the surface with controlled thickness. The \npossibility of working with any geometry, with basically no material \nrestrictions (as long as in powder format) without unnecessary \ncomplications, turns the process attractive to be used in different areas \nof applications (XIA et al., 2000; KOZUKA et al., 2012). \n\nDespite similarities with other techniques, few are the studies on \nthe formation of macroporous layers using the dip coating method. The \nuse of spherical ceramic particles to produce porosity by the interstices \nof its packing arrangement is a simple and easy method that required no \npore former addition. Therefore, there is no need to eliminate organic \nadditives during the process (MIAO; SUN, 2009).  \n\nIn this context, the aim of this work is to investigate the adequate \nprocessing conditions necessary for the production of macroporous \nzirconia coatings over zirconia substructures, using the dip coating \nmethod and without the presence of pore forming additives.  \n \n3.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \nCeramic powder \n\n \nIn this study, all experiments used 3% mol yttria-stabilized \n\nzirconia spray-dried powder (TZ-3YBE, TOSOH Co., Tokyo, Japan) \nwith defined spherical shape. Powder properties are presented in Table \n3.1. In order to work with narrower size distribution range, such material \nwas sieved, obtaining particles with average size (d50) of 40 \u00b5m and \nhereafter refereed as Z40 in the text. The powder size distribution was \nobtained using a particle size analyzer Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern \nInstruments, Marvern, UK). \n \n  \n\n53\n\n\n\n \n \n\nTable 3.1- Properties of commercial zirconia powder. \n \n\nProperties TZ-3YBE \n\nGranule size D(50) (\u00b5m) 60 \n\nParticle size D(50) (\u00b5m) 0.6 \n\nBulk density (g/cm\u00b3) 1.1 \n\nBending strength (MPa) 1000 \n\nFracture toughness (MPa.m0,5) 5.0 \n\nHardness (HV10) 1250 \n\n(Source: Tosoh Co.) \n \n\nThe first experiments aimed at testing different conditions of the \nprecursor powder on the layer deposited by dip coating. For this, \npowders were divided into three groups according to the thermal \ntreatment undergone: NT \u2013 no treatment; PS \u2013 pre-sintering at \n1150\u00b0C/1h; and S \u2013 sintering at 1500\u00b0C/2h. Such treatments were made \nin conventional furnace with no controlled atmosphere. Apparent \ndensities of powders (on different conditions) were experimentally \nobtained by vibrating particles in a graduated cylinder and, after \n\u201claying\u201d of particles, it was noted the respective volume and weight \u2013 to \napply to the equation:  \n\n  \n    .  \n\nThe addition of fine zirconia particles (d50= 3 ?m) to the ceramic \nsuspensions, aiming at increasing the bond strength between Z40 \nparticles, was also investigated as will be shown later. Several fine \nparticles contents (5, 10, 15 and 20vol%) were added to the solid \ncontents of the zirconia suspensions. Those particles, termed \u201cZ3\u201d from \nnow on, were produced by the ultrasonication of commercial zirconia \npowder suspension (20 vol% of solids in aqueous medium), using an \nultrasonic device (Vibra-cell VCX750, Sonics &amp; Materials Inc., U.S.A.). \nNo heat treatment was applied to this material. \n\n \nCeramic suspensions \n\n \nAll suspensions were prepared with fixed 30vol% of solid \n\ncontent, and dispersed in water. Previous experiments indicated the need \nof using different suspending agents in suspensions containing different \n\n54\n\n\n\n \n\npowders. Therefore, Darvan C-N (Vanderblit Minerals, LLC, U.S.A.) \nwas used to disperse suspensions with NT powder; while CMC \n(carboxymthyl cellulose, Emfal, Betim, Brazil) was used to suspend PS \nand S powders. The optimized concentration was 1% and 2%, \nrespectively, in relation to total mass of solids. The mixtures were made \nby magnetic stirring. \n\nRheological tests were performed using a viscometer (Thermo \nHaake VT550 Viscotester - SV 2P sensor, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., \nGermany), at room temperature, varying the shear rate up to 100 s-1, \nwhich is the range of the dip coating process (MORENO, 2005). \n\n \nDip coating \n\n \n\nThe dip coating was made on commercial yttria-stabilized \nzirconia substrates, pressed disks (190 MPa) with 10 mm of diameter \u2013 \nwithout heat treatment. The depositions were made in Dip Coater \nequipment (Construmaq, S\u00e3o Carlos, Brazil), using fixed speed and \nimmersion time in 4 mm.s-1 and 5 s, respectively. After deposition, the \npieces undergone air-drying (Appendix A) and were then sintered at \n1500\u00b0C/2h in air atmosphere. \n\nLayers were first coated using suspensions containing powders \nunder different conditions (NT, PS and S), and thereafter, with the best \nof the three conditions, the test was continued with addition of fine \nparticles. Figure 3.1 systematizes the steps conducted in this study for \nthe definition of the appropriate processing route that leads to the \nproduction of zirconia structures with surficial macroporosity obtained \nby the dip coating method. \n\n \nWear test \n \nA simple rotational wear test was applied to evaluate the integrity \n\nof the zirconia dip coated layers. The specimens containing dip coated \nlayers made of Z40 powders and fine particles (Z3) were first weighed \nand then ball milled for 30 minutes in a plastic jar containing 10 alumina \nballs. The mass loss of each specimen (substrate + coating) was \nregistered in the end of the test.  \n\n \nApparent porosity and mechanical strength measurements \n\n \n\nThe difficulty in measuring properties such as porosity and \nmechanical strength of surficial layers led us to try to reproduce the \n\n55\n\n\n\n \n \n\nporous structures obtained by the dip coating method, but in larger \ndimension, thus forming porous solids \u2013 easier to measurements. Slip \ncasting can be considered similar to the dip coating method for sharing \nthe same main mechanism of material deposition \u2013 cappilarity (related \nto mold/substrate\u2019s porosity). In this way, porous solids samples were \nproduced from the same suspensions used in the formation of layers, \npoured on a cylindrical mold (13 mm of diameter and 30 mm height), \nwith an absorbent base attached (draining water by a single face, without \npressuring). The samples dried in stove for 48 h, polished (to ensure \nparallelism among faces), and then, sintered at 1500\u00b0C/2h. \n\nThe apparent porosity was measured by ASTM C20-00, weighing \neach specimen under three conditions: D \u2013 dry; I \u2013 immersed in water; \nand W \u2013 wet (saturated with water, removed drops from the surface). \nThe apparent porosity (%) expresses the volumetric relation of open \npores to external volume. Apparent density (g/cm\u00b3) represents the \nquotient of the dry weight divided by the total volume, including pores. \nAll calculations consider water density as 1 g/cm\u00b3, and sintered zirconia \n(theoretical) as 6,05 g/cm\u00b3. \n\nUniaxial compression tests were applied to these samples. The \nheight disparity of the specimens remained h/D relation between 0,3 and \n1,5, as ASTM C133-97 (for uniaxial compressive tests) states. \nStructures were analyzed via SEM as regard to their morphology, \nporosity and connectivity of pores. \n \n  \n\n56\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Flow diagram summarizing the steps involved in the determination \nof the processing route for the production of zirconia structures with surficial \nmacroporosity by the dip coating technique. \n\n \n \n  \n\n57\n\n\n\n \n \n\n3.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nPowder characterization \n \n\nFigure 3.2 shows the particle size distribution of the commercial \nzirconia powder (as received), while Figure 3.2 shows the same material \nafter heat treatments (PS and S) and sieving. The effect of temperature is \nremarkable: NT and PS powders show superposition of the curves, with \na slight reduction in the \u201cPS\u201d size; S powders showed greater granule \nsizes (> 100 \u00b5m) among all tested conditions, probably due to a merge \nof small parts on greater volumes of agglomerates. A de-agglomeration \nprocess was needed after heat treatment of S powders to break the weak \nbonds between granules, generated by volumetric diffusion triggered by \nhigh temperature exposure (1500\u00b0C). The cumulative curve of the \nFigure 3.3 indicates a small difference between d50 of powders, with \nvalues around 42 \u00b5m for NT and PS powders, and 49 \u00b5m for S powders.  \n\n \nFigure 3.2 - Granule size distribution of commercial yttria-stabilized zirconia \n(TZ-3YBE). \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n58\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Granule size distributions (solid line) and cumulative curve (dashed \nline) of Z40 powders with different heat treatments. \n\n \n \n\nThe morphology of the three groups can be observed in Figure \n3.4, where the images confirm the mean sizes obtained from the particle \nsize analyses. It is possible to observe the spherical shape in all groups \nof powders. The NT powders, however, presented some fractured \nagglomerates explained by the lower cohesive strength of powders in the \nabsence of heat treatment. Greater consolidation of particles can be seen \nin PS and S groups, with homogeneous surfaces and less quantity of \nbroken agglomerates. The heat treatment can influence the reactivity of \nsurface by increasing atomic diffusion, leading to different densities of \npowders, as shown in the (REED, 1995). \n\nIt is important to emphasize the need to maintain the spherical \nmorphology of agglomerates throughout the process, ensuring the \nformation of porosity through particle packing (MIAO; SUN, 2009). \n  \n\n59\n\n\n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Z40 powders morphologies (NT, PS and S) and the respective \nvibrated density.  \n\n \n \n\nDip coating with different suspensions \n \n\nFigure 3.5 shows the particle size distributions of the suspensions \nwith the different powders. A new peak below 10 \u00b5m of particle size \nwas identified in NT suspension, meaning that the agglomerates \nundergone fragmentation during mixture of suspension. The distribution \nshifted from unimodal to bimodal. This phenomenon was not verified \nwith the PS and S suspension, which underlines the higher cohesion \nreported previously in the SEM inspection of the different powders \n(Figure 3.4).  \n \n  \n\n60\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 - Particle size distribution of Z40 suspensions: non thermal treated \n(NT), partially sintering (PS) and sintering (S). \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.6 shows zirconia substrates dip coated with the \ndifferent powders (NT, PS and S). It can be seen that NT layer does not \npresent macroporosity and spherical particles, as seen in PS and S \nlayers. The smeared shape of NT layer is supported by the particle size \ndistribution curve plotted in Figure 3.5. Despite the undesired \nmorphology, this layer showed good cohesion and adhesion to the \nsubstrate. On the other hand, layers formed by PS and S powders \nexhibited particles with spherical shape that were homogeneously \ndistributed over the substrate, exhibiting the desired configuration of \nparticles packing. The higher magnification of the PS layer micrograph, \nhowever, revealed the presence of small zirconia fragments within the \nspherical particles, working as bridges (necks) that could enhance the \ncohesion of the porous layer. These fragments were most probably \ntraced back to the stirring process of the PS powders, which did not \nexhibit the maximum strength, as was the case of the S powders. It must \nbe highlighted that no significant necks from solid-state diffusion were \nformed between the PS and S particles, which may compromise the \nmechanical strength of the coatings, due to a lack of consolidation \nbetween spherical granules of the layer. This lack of cohesion could be \nobserved by the particles detachment, especially in the S layer. This fact \nlead us to consider a new approach to increase the mechanical strength \nof the porous layer. Therefore, taking as inspiration the observations \n\n61\n\n\n\n \n \n\nmade in the NT layers, we decided to investigate the addition of fine \nparticles (Z3) to the Z40-PS suspensions to simultaneously enhance the \ncohesion of the porous layers and its adhesion to the substrate. The \nparticle size distribution of Z3 exhibited an average size of 3 \u00b5m (Figure \n3.7). Small particles have the advantage of a greater superficial area, \nwhen compared to coarser ones, which induces a larger driving force for \nsintering. \n \n\nFigure 3.6 - SEM of deposited layer using Z40 NT suspension (A), Z40 PS \n(B) and Z40 S (C). \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 3.6-A shows the particle size distribution of suspensions \nwith varied contents of fine particles. The presence of Z3 is evidenced \nby the peaks under 10 \u00b5m, which increases with greater contents of fine \nparticles in the suspension. The viscosity analysis revealed a \npseudoplastic behavior of the suspensions. Furthermore, the viscosity \ntended to decrease at a higher amount of Z3 particles. This behavior is in \n\n62\n\n\n\n \n\naccordance with Moreno (2005) that reported better flow of suspensions \nwith wider particle size distributions at higher shear rates.  \n\n \nFigure 3.7 \u2013 (A) Particle size distribution of fine particles (Z3); (B) Size \ndistribution of Z40 suspensions with the addition of different contents; and (C) \nviscosities as a function of the shear rate of the Z40 suspensions with the \naddition of several contents of Z3 particles. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.8 shows the micrographs of layers formed with PS \npowder plus different percentages of fine particles (Z3). The addition of \n5% Z3 (Figure 3.8-a) showed no effect at the neck formation. Above \n10% Z3, it is possible to note bonds between two or more Z40 particles, \nspread homogeneously over the layer. As the Z3 content increases it is \npossible to see the greater number of bonds within the particles, without \nsignificantly impacting the porosity and interconnectivity between the \npores.  \n \n \n \n  \n\n63\n\n\n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.8 - SEM of layers containing Z40 plus: (a) 5% Z3; (b) 10% Z3; (c) \n15% Z3 e (d) 20% Z3. \n\n \n \nThe influence of the addition of the Z3 particles on the cohesion \n\nof the porous layer was accessed by the wear test previously described, \nwhich results are plotted in Figure 3.9. It can be seen that the weight loss \nin the 5% Z3 sample was ~10 times higher the weight loss of the \nremaining samples, which highlights the lack of sufficient bonds \nbetween particles shown in Figure 3.8. The weight loss verified for \ncontents above 10% Z3 dropped significantly, which evidences the \nbeneficial effect of the Z3 particles as binding agents of the coarser \nparticles.  \n\n \n  \n\n64\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 - Weight loss of the Z40-coated zirconia substrates as a function of \nthe fine particles (Z3) content in the dip coating suspension, during wear test. \n\n \n \nCompression tests on porous solids made by slip casting, using \n\nthe same suspensions of the dip coating process, confirm the tendency to \nincrease strength of structures with addition of Z3, as seen in Figure \n3.10. This resulted in the desired increase in the strength of the dip-\ncoated layer. The specimen with 15% Z3 showed the lowest weight loss \nand, therefore, higher strength of deposited layer among all tested \nconditions.

CONCLUSIONS \n \n\nThis work aimed at defining a processing route for producing \nsurficial macroporous zirconia structures by the dip coating method. The \nfollowing conclusions could be drawn: \n\n? To produce porous layers by the dip coating method, the \nprecursor powder must exhibit adequate cohesion to preserve the \nstarting morphology during the whole dip coating process and thus \nallowing the formation of porosity at the particles packing interstices. \n\n?  A pre-sintering heat treatment of zirconia powders at 1150\u00b0C \nwas found appropriate to maintain powder\u2019s spherical morphology \nduring processing.  \n\n? The unimodal powder distribution, the powder size (Z40; \n~40?m) and the zirconia sintering conditions (1500\u00b0C) resulted in the \nformation of weak bonds between the particles that formed the porous \nlayer. To solve that, fine particles (Z3) of zirconia powders (~3 \u00b5m; \n\n66\n\n\n\n \n\n15% Z3) were successfully used as binding agent of the coarser \nparticles, thus enhancing the cohesion of the particles composing the \nporous layers without affecting the connectivity of porosity.   \n\n \n* References at the end of the dissertation. \n \n\n  \n\n67\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n4. Optimization of porous layers route to obtain porous \ngradient on zirconia substrate by dip coating method \n \n4.1. INTRODUCTION \n\n \nZirconia has been expanding its space in advanced ceramic \n\napplications since the mid-1970\u2019s, when the discovery of toughening \nmechanisms and increasing strength due to a phase transformation came \nto light. The need for the addition of stabilizers to control this \ntransformation has opened up a range of new applications, depending on \npredominant structure of zirconia, influenced by the amount and main \nelement of the additive. Yttrium oxide added to zirconia structures \nproduce materials with superior mechanical properties such as high \nstrength and flexibility, enough to compete with titanium alloys, besides \nbeing considered inert in contact with body, which allows its use as \northopedic implants, bone grafts, and dental restorations (DENRY; \nKELLY, 2008).  \n\nStructures of bones and teeth are natural examples of the so called \nfunctionally graded materials (FGM): the first case, a difference on the \nporosity between surface and core regions improves resistance to \nbending; and in the second case, by the dentin-enamel transition that \nlinks mechanical resistance of the nucleus (dentin) with chemical \nresistance of the surface (enamel). Natural teeth have the potential to last \na lifetime, so the current implants try to mimic its structure to increase \nthe useful life of specimens by reducing residual stresses from the \ncontact between dissimilar materials, which is one of the main causes of \nearly fracture (MEHRALI et al., 2013). \n\nThe gradient transition of properties, structures and/or \ncompositions are designed to withstand different demands (mechanical, \nchemical, etc.) distributed along a section, and can be drawn to be at \ncontinuous or discrete format. Continuous transitions exhibit better \nproperties although the process is expensive and complex; while discrete \ntransition can be produced by deposition of successive layers that \ngradually changes its composition, forming a structure with transition \nbands (MIYAMOTO et al., 1999; UDUPA et al., 2014). The processing \nof layer depositions can vary in price, complexity and reproducibility, \nranging from CVDs to coatings in general. Among these, the dip coating \nhas the advantage of being a simple and low-cost technique, capable to \ncover a wide range of shapes. The deposition occurs by the immersion \nof a substrate in a suspension containing precursor material, which is \nincorporated into the surface via capillary forces. The thickness of the \n\n69\n\n\n\n \n \n\nlayers is controlled by rheological conditions of suspensions and process \nparameters, such as speed and time of immersion (GROSSO, 2011; \nBRINKER, 2013). \n\nThe development of homogeneous or graded porous surfaces on \nbiomaterials allows an improvement on osteointegration (as the case of \ncement-free implants) and also creates a favorable environment for the \nfunctionalization of this structure through impregnation or coating with \nof a second phase. For both applications, the pore size could range from \n50 to 400 \u00b5m in order to optimize permeability of the layer and growth \nof natural tissues. Porosity also increases exposed surface area, which is \nconvenient on interfaces structures (MIAO; SUN, 2009). \n\nIn this study, we report on the production of zirconia structures \nwith surface macroporosity through the dip coating technique. Building \nup mono or multilayers of zirconia suspensions with different powders \nsizes allowed the production of homogeneous and graded macro surface \nporosity over the zirconia substrates. Practical examples as to these \nporosities may be applied are given in the end of the paper. \n\n \n4.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nProduction of surface homogeneous macroporosity \n\n \nThe base material of this study was a 3% mol yttria-stabilized \n\nzirconia spray-dried powder (TZ-3YBE, TOSOH Co., Tokyo, Japan). \nThis commercial powder, formed by spherical agglomerates with \naverage size of 60 \u00b5m and green density of 1,1 g/cm\u00b3, was used in two \ndifferent forms: pre-sintered powders and as fine particles. The pre-\nsintered powders underwent a heat treatment at 1150\u00b0C for 1 h for \nconsolidation of the starting agglomerates. They were afterwards sieved \nto obtain narrower size distributions, forming three groups of particles \nwith average sizes of 40, 70 and 100 \u00b5m, hereafter referred as Z40, Z70 \nand Z100, respectively (Figure 4.1). The fine powders were obtained \nfrom a sonication process of the commercial powders for de-\nagglomeration, thus resulting in particle sizes of approximately 3 to 10 \n\u00b5m, hereafter referred as Z3 (Figure 4.1). The F particles did not \nundergo heat treatment. All size distribution analyses were made in \nMastersizer 2000 (Malvern) equipment.  \n\nMeasurements of density were made by analysis of volume of \npowder occupied in a test tube (pycnometry), and its respective mass. It \n\n70\n\n\n\n \n\nwas necessary to vibrate the test tube for 3 minutes, in order to \naccommodate particles compactly.  \n\n \nFigure 4.1 - Particle size distribution of (a) the three groups of \u201ccoarse\u201d zirconia \nused as base materials; and (b) fine particles. \n\n \n \n\nAll ceramic suspensions were prepared with 30 vol.% of solid \ncontent and 2 m.% of the suspending agent CMC \n(carboxymethylcellulose) (Emfal, Betim, Brazil), in reference to total \nsolid mass. The solid contents of the suspensions were composed by a \nmixture of coarse and fine powders: Z40-15% Z3, Z70-25%Z3 and \nZ100-25%Z3 (relation to volume). The fine particles contents in the \ndifferent suspensions were determined based on previous experiments.  \n\nThe dip coating was made over uniaxially pressed commercial \nzirconia discs (150 MPa), non-sintered, with 20 mm of diameter and 2 \nmm height. The layers build up on zirconia substrates followed the next \nsequence: discs were first dipped into Z3 suspension to form a thin \nadhesive layer between the substrate and the upper coarse powder layer. \nThe first dipped layer of Z3 powders dried in air before receiving the \nnext layer of coarser particles. During experimental work, it was found \nthe need to perform in multilayered specimens intermediate heat \ntreatments to the freshly deposited layers in order to avoid the layers \nleaching to the suspension. Three treatments were tested: air drying, \nmuffle kiln and pre-sintering (1150\u00b0C), with the latter being the most \nefficient in maintaining the layers morphology.  Therefore, specimens \nwith homogeneous surface porosity were produced with one, two and \nthree dips (in the same suspension), passing through a pre-sintering \ntreatment between each dip (Appendix A). \n\nAfter the build-up of the last layer, the specimens were air-dried \nand air sintered in a conventional furnace at 1500\u00b0C for 2h. Scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM) (TM3030, Hitachi, Japan) was used to \n\n71\n\n\n\n \n \n\nanalyze the microstructure of the different specimens. Specimens were \ngold coated prior to SEM inspection. \n\n \nProduction of surface graded macroporosity \n\n \n\nTo produce the gradient of macroporosity at the surface of \nzirconia discs, a sequence of layers was deposited, following the same \nsteps mentioned above for the production of homogeneous porosity: a \nlayer of Z3 particles is first deposited followed by a sequential \ndeposition of smaller to bigger powders, using Z40, Z70 and Z100 \nsuspensions, respectively. Two conditions were tested: a single \nsequential dip in each suspension (Z40 + Z70 + Z100), condition \nreferred as Grad SD; and double sequential dip in each suspension \n(2xZ40 + 2xZ70 + 2xZ100), referred as Grad DD. It must be referred \nthat both Grad SD and Grad DD specimens underwent a preliminary dip \nof Z3 prior to coarse powders layers, similarly to the above described \nfor specimens with homogenous porosity. The specimens were finally \nair sintered at 1500\u00b0C for 2h. \n\n \nPorous solids by slip casting \n\n \nIn order to characterize the mechanical properties of the porous \n\nlayers tested in this study, porous solids with cylindrical shape were \nproduced from the same suspensions used to produce the porous \ncoatings in the zirconia discs, using the slip casting technique (Appendix \nB).  Despite they are different techniques, slip casting was found to have \nhigh similitude to dip coating, thus allowing to produce porous solids \nwith properties close to the layers produced over the zirconia substrates. \nHence, several cylindrical porous solids were produced using a polymer \nmold (13 mm of diameter and 30 mm height) with an absorbent base \nattached. Suspensions with coarse powders (Z40, Z70 and Z100) and \nvarying Z3 contents (20, 30, 40 and 50vol%) were tested.  Suspensions \nwere poured into the mold, drained by the absorbent base, and dried in a \nstove for 48 h. The specimens showed different height, but the h/D \nrelation remains between 0.3 and 1.5 according to ASTM C133-97 (for \ncompressive tests). The specimens were polished to ensure parallelism \nbetween faces, and then, sintered at 1500\u00b0C/2h. Structures were \nanalyzed via SEM as regard to their morphology, porosity and \nconnectivity of pores. \n\nThe apparent porosity was measured using ASTM C20-00, by \nweighing of the specimens under three conditions: D \u2013 dry; I \u2013 \n\n72\n\n\n\n \n\nimmersed in water; and W \u2013 wet (saturated with water, removed drops \nfrom the surface). The apparent porosity (%) expresses the volumetric \nrelation of open pores to external volume. Apparent density (g/cm\u00b3) \nrepresents the quotient of the dry weight divided by the total volume, \nincluding pores. All calculations consider water density as 1 g/cm\u00b3, and \nsintered zirconia (theoretical) as 6.05 g/cm\u00b3. \n\n \nP (%) = (   )\n\n(   )\n.100   (Equation 4.1) \n\n \n?ap (g/cm\u00b3) = \n\n \n\n(   )\n                 (Equation 4.2) \n\n \n\nMechanical characterization \n\n \nThe fracture strength of coated specimens was obtained from a \n\nball-on-three-balls test (B3B) performed in a universal testing machine \n(Instron 8874, MA, USA), especially used for testing disc shaped \nspecimens of britlle materials. The specimens were loaded under a \ncrosshead speed of 0.15 mm/s until its rupture, using a load cell of 25 \nkN. The strength is the force applied at the first \u201cbreak\u201d of the specimen \n(ZIELKE et al, 2016). \n\nThe fracture surfaces were then inspected by SEM in order to \nassess the influence of the biaxial test on the fracture pattern and \nintegrity of the porous coatings.  \n\nThe mechanical properties of the porous coatings were estimated \nby the assessment of the compressive strength of porous solids produced \nby slip casting. Tests were conducted in a universal testing machine \n(Emic DL 2000) with load cell TRD 27 (200 kN) and loading speed of \n0.5 mm/min.  \n \n \n4.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\nCharacterization of homogeneous macroporous layers \n\n \nThe comparison of morphologies of treated (pre-sintered) and \n\nuntreated Z100 powders can be seen in Figure 4.2. Treated powders \n(PS) exhibit consolidated surfaces with higher cohesion than the non-\ntreated (NT), evidenced by the spherical shape and the absence of \nfractured agglomerates. This allows the agglomerates to keep its original \nshape during the stirring processes associated to the preparation of \n\n73\n\n\n\n \n \n\nsuspensions for the dip coating process. The heat treatment imparts to \nthe powders a slight increase in density (~20%) relative to non-treated \nones: 1.20 g.cm-\u00b3 for non-treated (NT) powders and 1.47 g.cm-\u00b3 for pre-\nsintered (PS) powders.  \n\nIn the previous chapter, addition of fine powders to the coarser \npowders suspensions was necessary for increasing cohesion of the \nmacroporous layers deposited over zirconia substrates.  \n\nFigure 4.3 compares morphologies of two Z40 layers (a) with no \naddition of Z3 particles, and (b) with addition of 15% (vol.%) of Z3 \nparticles. It is clearly seen the beneficial effect of the fine particles in \nterms of setting bonds between the coarser particles without \nsignificantly compromising the interconnectivity between them. The \nrelation of fine particle (Z3) to coarse particles (Z40) content have been \npreviously optimized (in the previous chapter) as regard to the layer\u2019s \nmorphologies with varying Z3 contents, porosity and compressive \nstrength of \u201clayers\u201d (porous solids with similar compositions).  \n \nFigure 4.2 - SEM of Z100 powder (a) treated at 1150\u00b0C and (b) untreated.  \n\n \n  \n\n74\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Top view of zirconia layers produced by dip coating using Z40 \nsuspensions: a) no addition of fine particles (Z3) to Z40 suspension; b) addition \nof 15% Z3 to the Z40 suspension. \n\n \n \nAs stated before, the porous solids structures made by slip casting \n\nmay differ in some extent to the layers deposited by dip coating. \nNevertheless, due to the similar packing arrangement of both processes, \nthis process was selected for producing the porous solids that allowed \nestimating the porosity and compressive strength of the dip coated \nlayers. The porous solids revealed a decreasing trend of porosity for \nincreasing contents of Z3 particles in the suspensions, regardless of the \ncoarse powder size (Z40, Z70 or Z100), as depicted in Figure 4.4 and \nfurther evidenced in density measurements presented in Table 4.1. \n\nDensity values follow the opposite trend, with higher contents of \nZ3 particles producing denser solids. Coarser powders combined with \nZ3 particles show higher densities results in improved packing \nefficiency \u2013 a greater difference on the diameters of the components \ninfluences negatively in the point of view of forming porosity, as \nOliveira\u2019s graphs indicates (OLIVEIRA et al., 2000) due to a more \ncompact packing arrangement. Additionally, higher densities impart \ngreater mechanical strength and stiffness to porous solids since porosity \nis regarded reducing the Young\u2019s modulus of the system. \n \n  \n\n75\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 4.4 - Influence of fine particles content on the apparent porosity of \nporous solids produced by slip casting using suspensions containing coarse \npowders (Z40, Z70 or Z100) and different amounts of fine particles (Z3) \ncontents. \n\n \n \nTable 4.1 \u2013 Density measurement (g.cm-3) of porous solids, made by slip \ncasting, of Z40, Z70 and Z100 specimens. \n\n% Z3 Z40 Z70 Z100 \n\n20 3.38 \u00b1 0.04 3.82 \u00b1 0.30 3.57 \u00b1 0.17 \n30 3.60 \u00b1 0.14 3.61 \u00b1 0.09 4.20 \u00b1 0.17 \n40 3.97 \u00b1 0.08 3.93 \u00b1 0.16 4.23 \u00b1 0.46 \n50 3.96 \u00b1 0.87 4.45 \u00b1 0.23 4.86 \u00b1 0.92 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.5 shows the compressive strength of the porous solids \n\nmade of different powder sizes (Z40, Z70 and Z100) as a function of the \nfine particles (Z3) contents in the suspensions. It can be seen that \nstrength increases with the increasing content of Z3 particles and that \nthis effect was more pronounced for particles of bigger size.  \n\nFigure 4.6 shows the single- and double-dipped zirconia \nsubstrates with Z40, Z70 and Z100 powders. It can be clearly seen from \nthe image the effect of particle size as well as the number of dips. A \nsingle-dip was not able to cover the edges of the substrate regardless the \nsize of the powder. When two dips were performed, the Z40 and Z70 \nsuspensions a full coverage of the edges of the specimens was achieved. \nThe same effect was only obtained for Z100 specimens after the third \ndip coating.  \n\n76\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Compressive strength (MPa) of the porous solids produced by slip \ncasting, varying Z3 content. \n\n \n \nFigure 4.6 - SEM of layers formed by a single dip (first line) and double dip \n(second line) in suspensions: Z40-15%Z3 (left), Z70-25%Z3 (middle) and \nZ100-25%Z3 (right). The smaller images show a larger magnification (x1000) \nof the respective system (column), with the focus of showing the connections \nbetween coarser particles. \n\n \n \n\nAs the number of dips increases, it becomes more difficult to \ncontrol thickness due to excessive formation of bubbles on the surface in \nsome substrates. Two possible causes can be advanced: insufficient time \nfor the liquid to penetrate the surface porosity, and the viscosity of the \nsuspension, which can also affect the time required to complete \n\n77\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\u201cabsorption\u201d of the liquid. High viscosity can also form thick droplets, \nespecially at the edges, causing heterogeneities in the layers. \nImmediately drying of the substrate after its withdraw from suspension \nmay avoid gross marks on the deposited surface, but it does not \neliminate the formation of irregularities. \n\nFigure 4.7 shows SEM micrographs of the cross section view of \ndifferent specimens produced in this study. The thickness of each \nspecimen is marked with dashed line for guidance of the reader, as the \ndepth effect resulting from specimens tilting during observation may be \nmisleading regarding the real thickness value. The thicknesses values \nmeasured on different specimens were recorded and exhibited in Figure \n4.8. The coating thickness was found to vary linearly with the number of \ndips for all the powder sizes. Comparing the three systems, the single-\ndip Z40 layer exhibited the best particle packing, since its average \nthickness was equivalent to overlap 2.7 particles of Z40, higher than \nZ70 and Z100 layers, with average thicknesses similar to 1.6 \n\u201coverlapped\u201d particles (considering respective mean size of each \nsystem).  \n\n \nFigure 4.7 - SEM micrograph of the cross-section view of the Z40, Z70 and \nZ100 layers formed by one, two and three dips. \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n78\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 - Layer evolution with number of dips. \n\n \n \n\nBiaxial strength tests \n\n \nDip coated specimens were subjected to biaxial strength tests \n\n(B3B) to assess the influence of the macroporous coatings on the \nflexural strength of the zirconia substrates. Figure 4.9 shows the results \nobtained from the B3B test of the coated specimens, as well as of the \nuncoated specimens for reference. It can be seen that, regardless of the \ntype of coating, the fracture loadings of coated specimens were above \nthe results obtained for the uncoated specimens, taken as the \u201ccontrol \ngroup\u201d (1500 \u00b1 190 N), mean value indicated by the dashed line and the \ngray area represents the standard deviation. This means that the presence \nof macroporous coatings did not induce a detrimental effect on the \nfracture resistance of the zirconia specimens, as could be initially \nsupposed based on the higher surface roughness imparted by porous \ncoatings. The results obtained from static load to fracture tests may \ntherefore present a different trend under fatigue conditions. Therefore, \nfurther studies should be conducted to suitably address this issue.    \n\n \n  \n\n79\n\n\n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Fracture strength of the surficial macroporous zirconia specimens \nobtained from B3B test: fracture load (N) versus the number of dip coatings (1x, \n2x, 3x) with different suspensions (Z40, Z70 and Z100). \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.10 shows the fracture surface of the Z40 and Z100 \nspecimens with single-dip coating, and Z70 double-dipped specimen, \nwith an arrow indicating the loading point at the compressive surface. \nThe compressive curls are well evidenced at this adjacent region. \nDelamination occurrences of the porous layers were seen in specimens \nsubjected to the flexural test (B3B), with thicker layers being more \nprone to this phenomenon. Hence, single-dipped specimens showed few \nor no delamination of layers; whereas specimens with double and triple \ndipped layers exhibited greater occurrences.  \n \nFigure 4.10 - Fracture surface of Z40 (single-dip), Z70 (double-dip) and Z100 \n(single-dip) specimens. \n\n \n \n\nA double-dipped Z40 layer after B3B test is seen in Figure 4.11, \nin which the beginning of the delamination is visible as a propagation of \nthe stress zone: the yellow arrow represents direction of loading, while \ndark arrows, the direction of delamination. The white dashed arrow \nindicates the fracture origin at the tensile surface of the specimen.   \n\n80\n\n\n\n \n\nThe delamination trend during flexural test was exhibited by all \ngroups as seen in Table 4.2. However, thicker coatings and bigger \nparticles presented higher delamination incidence.  \n\n \nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Z40 double-dipped layer: cross-section of a fractured specimen \n(above) and a non-tested sample (below). \n\n \n \nTable 4.2 - Percentage of delaminated specimens after B3B test (considering \nany sign of delamination). \n\n 1 dip 2 dip 3 dip \n\nZ40 18 % 36 % 70 % \n\nZ70 - 30 % 60 % \n\nZ100 10 % 40 % 70 % \n \n\n \n\n \n\n81\n\n\n\n \n \n\nCharacterization of graded macroporous layers \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 shows the cross-section view of layers deposited by \nthe consecutive immersion in suspensions with Z40, Z70 and Z100 \npowders. In Figure 4.12-A, the graded porous layer was obtained by a \nsingle dip in each suspension (Z40 + Z70 + Z100), making a total of \nthree dips. In Figure 4.12-B, the graded porous layer was produced by \ndipping twice in each suspension (2xZ40 + 2xZ70 + 2xZ100), making a \ntotal of 6 dips. The thickness is the main difference among the \nstructures: Grad SD with average values around 300 \u00b1 50 \u00b5m, and Grad \nDD around 660 \u00b1 240 \u00b5m. The detailed view of the graded coating \nprofiles is seen in Figure 4.12 from the high magnification micrographs, \nwhere the dash lines indicate the average bands of each zirconia \npowders.  \n\nTable 4.3 presents the fracture load values obtained for Grad SD \nand Grad DD specimens (n ~ 10). The fracture load of both specimens \nremained within the same range of the values obtained for specimens \nwith homogeneous porous layers (increase ~20%), which means that the \nthickness of layers and the number of dips did not seem to compromise \nthe static fracture resistance. Nevertheless, the same concerns regarding \nthe fatigue behavior mentioned above for specimens with homogeneous \nporous layers, also applies for Grad SD and Grad DD specimens.  \n \n  \n\n82\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 - Layer formed with sequential dip in Z40, Z70 and Z100 \nsuspensions: (a) Grad SD \u2013 single-dipped on each group, (b) Grad DD \u2013 double-\ndipped. \n\n \n\n \n \nTable 4.3 - Measured values of the layer\u2019s thickness, total specimens thickness \nand fracture load (N) after B3B test for the specimens with graded macroporous \ncoatings: Grad SD and Grad DD. \n\n \nLayer Thickness \n\n(\u00b5m) \n\nSpecimen \n\nThickness  \n\n(mm) \n\nFracture Load \n\n(N) \n\nGrad SD 290 \u00b1 40 2,71 \u00b1 0,05 1808,7 \u00b1 97,3 \n\nGrad DD 750 \u00b1 220 3,93 \u00b1 0,41 1741,1 \u00b1 200,5 \n \n\n83\n\n\n\n \n \n\nThe occurrence of delamination was also verified in the case of \ngradient layers, as shown in Figure 4.13.

CONCLUSIONS \n \n\nThis work aimed to produce and characterize homogeneous and \ngraded macroporous zirconia layers over zirconia substrates by the dip \ncoating technique. The following conclusions could be drawn: \n\n? Homogeneous and graded macroporous layers were \nsuccessfully built over zirconia substrates using suspensions with \npowders of different sizes (Z40, Z70, Z100 and fine particle (Z3)), using \nthe dip coating technique. \n\n? The thickness of the porous layer increased with the increasing \nnumber of dips, regardless the size of the powder (Z40, Z70, Z100). \n\n84\n\n\n\n \n\n? The fracture strength of the specimens with homogeneous and \ngraded macroporous layers was higher than that of uncoated specimens \n(~20%), meaning that coatings were not detrimental for the static \nstrength of the porous specimens. \n\n? The flexural tests imparted delamination occurrences in the \nporous layer of some specimens, with the higher incidence being \nobserved for coatings with larger thicknesses and bigger \nparticles/granules. \n\n \n  \n\n85\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n5. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS &amp; SUGGESTIONS \n \n5.1. CONCLUSIONS \n\n \nThe investigation on the route of fabrication of surface porous \n\nlayers of zirconia presented as main conclusions: \n? The powders must remain spherical throughout the processing \n\nin order to generate the expected interstices. For this, heat treatment of \nthe starting material is required;  \n\n? A better cohesion of the layer is achieved by adding fine \nparticles to the system, acting as binder agent for coarser particles;  \n\n? A \u201cpre-deposition\u201d of fine particles (<10 \u00b5m) on the substrate is \nnecessary for improved adhesion among substrate and successive layers; \n\n? Homogeneous and graded layers were feasible to be produced \nby successive depositions over the substrate, although studies related to \nthe drying and heat treatment between depositions should be further \ninvestigated;  \n\n? Fracture strength of both layers, homogeneous and graded, were \nhigher than uncoated substrates; \n\n? Flexural tests evidence delaminations of the porous layers in \nsome specimens, increasing incidence on larger thickness layers. \n\n \n \n\n5.2. SUGGESTIONS \n \n\nDuring this study, some points of the process indicate the need of \nimprovement, suggesting that future works should study: \n\n? An investigation on the effect of drying on the layers, \nconsidering multiple depositions, in order to avoid delaminations and \ndrying defects; \n\n? Estimate residual stresses of porous solids (slip casting)  after \nburn-out by dilatometry; \n\n? A study of the impregnation with porcelain and/or bioglass on \ngraded and homogeneous layers structures for biomedical applications; \n\n? A study of interconnectivity of pores, on layer, and a complex \nanalysis of the thickness to obtain a ; \n\n? Mechanical characterization of the samples (both homogeneous \nand graded porous layers) under humidity and cyclic loadings for \nbiomedical applications; \n\n? Characterization for biomedical applications: in vitro and in \nvivo. \n\n87\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n \n\nALBINO, M. P.; GARRIDO, L. B.

Between the dips, three \nsteps were tested: 1 - air flow (drying by air), 2 - pre-sintering (1150\u00baC) \nand 3 - sintering (1500\u00baC). Figure A.1 shows the formed layers, with the \naverage final thickness indicated on each case.  \n\nAlthough there was no substantial difference on the thickness of \ntested conditions, the images show a higher value to the \"pre-sinter\" \namid layers condition, which indicates a lower material loss during \nsubsequent immersion than the \u201cair dryer\u201d condition. The sintering step \namong immersions could induce a great reduction of the sphere sizes, \nleading to crack the layers. In this way, it was decided to \u201cpre-sintering\u201d \nthe samples on every interval of subsequent deposition.  \n \nFigure A.1 - Effect of heat treatment on the final thickness of layers form by \ntwo immersions: Z40 followed by Z70: (a) air dryer, (b) 1150\u00b0C (no plateau), \nand (c) 1500\u00b0C (no plateau). \n\n \n  \n\n95\n\n\n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nAPPENDIX B - Porous solids \n \n\nThe idea of production of porous solids emerged to estimate \nvalues of porosity and resistance of the layers produced by dip coating, \nonce there was no way to evaluate those properties in such a thin part. \nAs discussed along the work, the morphology of these solids were not \nequivalent to the deposited layers via dip coating, as seen in the images \nbelow. Despite morphologic differences, the mechanism used to form \nthose solids is basically the same used on dip coating, in a way that \nparticles are conformed almost in absence of external forces, what \nenables an approximation of properties of both materials (made by slip \ncasting and dip coating). \n\nMost specimens showed good distribution between fine and \ncoarse particles, but some of them presented spots of agglomerate fine \nparticles. The increase of Z3 amount was not evidenced in all images of \nporous solids; the heterogeneity of the specimens does not allowed a \npattern of morphology in different situations. In the comparison between \nporous solids (slip casting) and deposited layers under the same \ncondition (amount of Z3), the \u201cbinder mass\u201d was more visible in the \nfirst case, possibly due to a gathering of particles near external faces, \nformed during drying.  \n\n \nFigure B.1 - Porous solids made with Z40 powder plus 5% Z3 (left) and 15% \nZ3 (right). \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n97\n\n\n\n \n \n\nFigure B.2 - Porous solids made with Z70 (left) and Z100 (right), both with \n25% Z3. \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n98\n\n\n\n \n\nAPPENDIX C - Delamination and defects on deposited layers \n \n\n Several defects occurred during experiments. The first trace of \ndelamination appeared after pre-sintering of a single-dipped specimen, \nwith a detached layer that indicates drying issues. From this evidence, \nthe pieces began to pass through air-drying before undergoing pre-\nsintering (or sintering) step. After B3B bending tests, this problem was \nagain evidenced with a slight difference: the detachment occurs between \nlayers, not between layer and substrate as seen it before. Figure C.1 (left) \nshows part of the layer adhered to the substrate, illustrating the \ndescribed situation on a double-dipped Z40 layer; the right image also \ncontains parts of an adhered layer, near the fracture surface. The thicker \nthe layer, the higher frequency of delaminations was observed, \nsuggesting a possible relation of the defects with the successive \nexposure to thermal treatments (among dips). \n \nFigure C.1 - Example of delamination of the double-dipped Z40 layer, after \nflexural test. Left: cross-section view. Right: top view of the fracture surface. \n\n \n \n\nBubbles and thickness variations were also common defects \nalong experiments, both observed in Figure C.1 (right). The emergence \nof bubbles is associated with the suspensions conditions: the tendency of \nsuspensions to become more viscous as reused after a few days, due to \nloss of water, favored bubble\u2019s formation. \n\nIn some layers produced with larger particles, Z70 and Z100, \nsmall islands of fine material were formed, as can be seen Figure C.2. \nTo avoid such heterogeneity, constant stirring of suspensions was \nrequired in the immersion intervals. \n \n  \n\n99\n\n\n\n \n \n\nFigure C.2 - Heterogeneous surface: isles of fine particles and/or lack of \ncoverage of the substrate. Up: Z70 - 1 dip; down: Z100 - 1 dip. \n\n \n \n\nThe presence of hollow spheres did not prove to be a problem in \nthe processing, nor in the porosity, but it was observed with great \nfrequency in the analysis of the layers, being a defect coming from the \nmanufacturer. \n \n  \n\n100\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure C.3 \u2013 Sintered hollow spheres. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n101\n\n\n \n \n    \n   HistoryItem_V1\n   AddNumbers\n        \n     Range: From page 23 to page 101; only odd numbered pages\n     Font: Times-Roman 10.5 point\n     Origin: top right\n     Offset: horizontal 43.20 points, vertical 43.20 points\n     Prefix text: ''\n     Suffix text: ''\n     Use registration colour: no\n      \n\n        \n     1\n     0\n     \n     TR\n     \n     1\n     23\n     TR\n     1\n     0\n     498\n     122\n     0\n     1\n     10.5000\n            \n                \n         Odd\n         23\n         SubDoc\n         101\n              \n\n       CurrentAVDoc\n          \n\n     43.2000\n     43.2000\n      \n\n        \n     QITE_QuiteImposingPlus3\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3.0j\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3\n     1\n      \n\n        \n     22\n     101\n     100\n     40\n      \n\n   1\n  \n\n    \n   HistoryItem_V1\n   AddNumbers\n        \n     Range: From page 23 to page 101; only even numbered pages\n     Font: Times-Roman 10.5 point\n     Origin: top left\n     Offset: horizontal 43.20 points, vertical 43.20 points\n     Prefix text: ''\n     Suffix text: ''\n     Use registration colour: no\n      \n\n        \n     1\n     0\n     \n     TL\n     \n     1\n     23\n     TR\n     1\n     0\n     498\n     122\n     0\n     1\n     10.5000\n            \n                \n         Even\n         23\n         SubDoc\n         101\n              \n\n       CurrentAVDoc\n          \n\n     43.2000\n     43.2000\n      \n\n        \n     QITE_QuiteImposingPlus3\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3.0j\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3\n     1\n      \n\n        \n     23\n     101\n     99\n     39\n      \n\n   1\n  \n\n    \n   HistoryItem_V1\n   DelPageNumbers\n        \n     Range: current page\n      \n\n        \n     1\n     494\n     235\n            \n                \n         1\n         CurrentPage\n         102\n              \n\n       CurrentAVDoc\n          \n\n      \n\n        \n     QITE_QuiteImposingPlus3\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3.0j\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3\n     1\n      \n\n        \n     67\n     101\n     67\n     1\n      \n\n   1\n  \n\n    \n   HistoryItem_V1\n   DelPageNumbers\n        \n     Range: current page\n      \n\n        \n     1\n     494\n     235\n            \n                \n         1\n         CurrentPage\n         102\n              \n\n       CurrentAVDoc\n          \n\n      \n\n        \n     QITE_QuiteImposingPlus3\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3.0j\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3\n     1\n      \n\n        \n     85\n     101\n     85\n     1\n      \n\n   1\n  \n\n    \n   HistoryItem_V1\n   DelPageNumbers\n        \n     Range: current page\n      \n\n        \n     1\n     494\n     235\n            \n                \n         1\n         CurrentPage\n         102\n              \n\n       CurrentAVDoc\n          \n\n      \n\n        \n     QITE_QuiteImposingPlus3\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3.0j\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3\n     1\n      \n\n        \n     87\n     101\n     87\n     1\n      \n\n   1\n  \n\n    \n   HistoryItem_V1\n   DelPageNumbers\n        \n     Range: current page\n      \n\n        \n     1\n     494\n     235\n    \n            \n                \n         1\n         CurrentPage\n         102\n              \n\n       CurrentAVDoc\n          \n\n      \n\n        \n     QITE_QuiteImposingPlus3\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3.0j\n     Quite Imposing Plus 3\n     1\n      \n\n        \n     95\n     101\n     95\n     1\n      \n\n   1\n  \n\n HistoryList_V1\n qi2base"}]}}}
