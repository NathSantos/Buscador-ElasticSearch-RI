For that reason, foreign suppliers of subsea equipment are \n\nincreasingly attracted by this dynamic market.  \n\nAgainst this background, this project develops an international strategy for the German \n\nmarine cable distributor Friesland Kabel within the Brazilian offshore oil and gas supply \n\nchain. The project thus critically analyzes the external business environment and internal \n\ncorporate resources by applying the PEST analysis, the Porter\u00b4s 5 Forces model and the VRIO \n\nframework. Core elements of the market entry strategy include a mission and vision \n\nstatement, an objective setting, an entry mode selection, a SWOT analysis, a marketing \n\nconcept and a strategic action plan. All business concepts and theories applied are prepared \n\nand assessed in detail. \n\nThe result of the study shows, that despite the recent economic downturn in the country \n\nand the oil and gas industry, there is a certain market potential for Friesland Kabel in the long \n\nterm. Additionally, the developed strategic measures provide a guideline about how the \n\ncompany can overcome main business barriers and leverage opportunities.  \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nBrazilian Oil and Gas Industry, International Strategy, Marine Cables, Strategic \n\nManagement  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nii \n\n \n\nAgradecimentos \n\nGostaria de agradecer ao meu orientador de tese M\u00e1rcio Alves Amaral Baptista por me \n\norientar e apoiar durante este projeto de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o.

Friesland Kabel, a German supplier of marine cable and offshore \n\nnetwork technology has been evaluating this market for several years as an option for \n\nbusiness expansion. However, the company did not come to a conclusion as to whether the \n\nmarket entry conditions are favorable, and if so, which strategy should be pursued. Against \n\nthis background, the objective of this study is to analyze the potential for Friesland Kabel in \n\nthe Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry and to provide guidance for managing the \n\ncompany\u00b4s market entrance. Therefore, the study contains two major sections. \n\n \n\nSection 1 assesses the market potential of Friesland Kabel by investigating the external \n\nbusiness environment and the internal resources of the company.  \n\n? The macroeconomic analysis discusses the main business restrictions and \n\nopportunities within the Brazilian market by applying the PESTLE framework. In \n\ndoing so, international indices and studies provide an inter-country comparison. \n\n? The industry analysis investigates the opportunities and business barriers of the \n\nBrazilian offshore industry and its related sub-segments. Moreover, the Porter\u00b4s 5 \n\nForces framework examines the competitive environment of the industry. Data about \n\nthe market rivalry is obtained from interviews with marine cable suppliers already \n\noperating on the market. \n\n? The VRIO framework serves as an approach to determine the competitive capabilities \n\nand resources of Friesland Kabel. This is completed and evaluated by interviews with \n\nkey corporate members of staff. \n\nSection 2 deals with the market entry strategy for Friesland Kabel which is divided into the \n\nfollowing elements: \n\n \n\n? First, the major corporate goals are specified by producing a mission and vision \n\nstatement and setting the objectives. \n\n?  Through a SWOT analysis, the principal factors that shape the strategic position of \n\nFriesland Kabel are determined. \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n\n \n\n? Based on the SWOT\u2013factors, strategic actions are elaborated. Among them, a stock \n\nstrategy, customer management and a step-by-step market approach can be \n\nhighlighted. \n\n? The entry mode decision was of particular importance. Here, the study focuses on a \n\ncooperative strategy and provides detailed information on how to shape potential \n\npartnerships. \n\n? Another priority is the marketing strategy. By applying the SAVE framework, a value \n\nbased marketing concept is introduced.  \n\n? Finally, an action plan proposes the managerial measures of Friesland Kabel. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nviii \n\n \n\nTable of Content \n1.

Introduction \n\nDuring the last two decades multinational enterprises (MNEs) have increasingly focused \n\non emerging markets. In 2012 emerging economies have, for the first time, absorbed a higher \n\nshare of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows than developed countries (United Nations, \n\n2013, p. 12) \u2013 a trend which continued in the following years (United Nations, 2014, p. 9). \n\nThis development is in the interest of both parties - MNEs as investors and emerging \n\neconomies as host markets. Western enterprises benefit from different sorts of local \n\ncompetitive advantages (Dunning, 2001, p. 176) whereas motives of the host countries \n\ninclude capital gains, job creation or transfer of know-how and technology. However, while \n\nemerging markets offer great opportunities, they also confront investors with different kinds \n\nof environmental challenges and transaction costs. For that reason, business organizations \n\nhave to thoroughly assess these markets and consequently develop appropriate strategies. \n\nFDI in emerging countries is concentrated on a small group of markets characterized by \n\nwealth of natural resources, large populations and high economic growth rates (Weigel, et al., \n\n1997, p. 1). These include in particular the so-called \u201cBRICS\u201d which describes the association \n\nof the five major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa \n\n(O`Neill, 2001, pp. 1-11). \n\n \n\n1.1 Problem Formulation \n\nBeing part of the BRICS group and the 7th largest economy in the world, Brazil nowadays \n\nis one of the most attractive markets for FDI. Especially the oil &amp; gas industry, driven by \n\nrecent discoveries of massive offshore petroleum and gas reserves, generates plenty of \n\nbusiness opportunities. For the next two decades, the exploration of Brazilian offshore sources \n\nwill require huge investments in infrastructure including the shipbuilding-, down- and \n\nupstream sector. According to experts, until 2020 half of the worldwide subsea equipment \n\nwill be produced in Brazil. For that reason, international suppliers of business-related services \n\nand products increasingly focus on this dynamic market in which the demand for offshore \n\ntechnology, equipment and know-how is tremendously high (AHK; GTAI, 2014, p. 16). \n\nGermany has strong economic ties with Brazil, which is its Germany\u00b4s most important \n\ntrading partner in Latin America. There are about 1.300 German companies in Brazil and the \n\nState of S\u00e3o Paulo is the biggest German business location outside the home country \n\n(Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt, 2015). Some German companies have already become established within \n\nthe Brazilian oil and gas supply chain. Friesland Kabel, a German distributor of marine \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\ncables, wires and data system technology, also considers this possibility for expanding its \n\nbusiness.  \n\n1.2 Research Questions and Objectives \n\nAgainst this background, the present project deals with the potential and the market entry \n\nfor Friesland Kabel in the Brazilian oil and gas industry. Accordingly, the work consists \n\nbasically of two parts derived from two overriding questions: \n\n \n\n1. What is the potential for Friesland Kabel in order to create economic value within the \n\nBrazilian oil and gas industry? \n\n \n\nBased on this question, the first part of the work focuses on the attractiveness and the \n\nsuitability of the Brazilian oil and gas market for Friesland Kabel. In this context, external \n\nmarket drivers and internal forces of the company will be identified and evaluated according \n\nto their business implications. To this aim, the research follows a top-down approach (Glowik \n\n&amp; Smyczek, 2011, p. 66) by analyzing first the external macro environment, second the \n\nindustry sector, and third the company\u00b4s internal resources and capabilities.  \n\n \n\n2. How can Friesland Kabel ensure a successful market entry into the Brazilian offshore \n\noil and gas industry? \n\n \n\nWith regard to the previously identified external and internal forces, the objective of the \n\nsecond part is to develop an appropriate market entry strategy. This involves mainly the \n\nelaboration of measures to overcome business barriers and to leverage market opportunities. \n\n \n\nThe two parts described above correspond to the first two phases of a strategic planning \n\nprocess: (1) Strategic Position and (2) Strategic Choice (Johnson, et al., 2008, p. 49). In this \n\nsense, the present project can be understood as an international strategy for Friesland Kabel.  \n\nAlthough the project focuses on one case, the results also provide inductive insights for \n\nother business organizations. The overall objectives of this project are to strengthen the \n\nbilateral trade between both countries, Brazil and Germany in general, to support German \n\ndirect investment in the Brazilian offshore market and to guarantee long term market success \n\nfor Friesland Kabel. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.3 Methodology \n\nIn accordance with the research questions, the case study approach is the most appropriate \n\nmethodology for this project. In comparison with other research methods, case studies provide \n\nmore insightful explanations (Yin, 2012, p. 5) and are preferred for contemporary (as opposed \n\nto historical events) and real-life events in which the researcher cannot control or manipulate \n\nthe behavior of samples (Dul &amp; Hak, 2008, p. 6). \n\nIn terms of design the project focuses on one case and a single unit of analysis (holistic, \n\nsingle case) (Yin, 2012, pp. 7-8). This choice is the logical consequence of the research \n\nobjective, which is to develop an international strategy for Friesland Kabel (single case) \n\nwithin the Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry (single unit of analysis).  \n\nThe data used in this project mainly consists of derived data (secondary data) in contrast to \n\ndata in natural settings (primary data) (Bromley, 1986, p. 13). This type of data is obtained \n\nfrom websites, articles, reports, statistics, books and economics magazines. \n\nWhere the project deals with the internal resources of Friesland Kabel and the competition \n\nin the company\u2019s related industry primary data is collected in addition.  \n\nFor the analysis of Friesland Kabels sources of competitive advantage it was important to \n\nidentify the individual perceived strengths and weaknesses from an internal perspective. Due \n\nto the complexity of this research topic, semi-structured interviews based on two core \n\nstandard questions have been conducted. By following this approach, it was possible to, on \n\nthe one hand, use a uniform interview structure, and on the other, to address specific aspects \n\nin greater depth (Mitchell &amp; Jolley, 2012, pp. 301-302). The selection of the respondents was \n\nrestricted to a small group of individual experts in order to maintain a high level of expertise. \n\nRegarding the competition of Friesland Kabel, standardized (structured) interviews with 5 \n\nmajor marine cable suppliers on the Brazilian market have been carried out. This method sets \n\na fixed series of questions. Thus, comparability across the respondents could be guaranteed \n\n(Mitchell &amp; Jolley, 2012, p. 301). The companies were selected through internet research and \n\nvia personal contacts on the fair trades Brasil Offshore and Navalshore in 2015. The \n\ninterviews have been conducted by telephone, since the willingness to participate and the \n\nprobability to address the right contact person is significantly higher than through online \n\nsurveys. In preparation for the interviews, a questionnaire (see appendix 5) was elaborated \n\nthat include a mix of open-ended and closed-ended (multiple choice design) question types. \n\nThe web-based survey platform SurveyMonkey served as a basis for this (SurveyMonkey, \n\n2015). \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe data analysis pursues a qualitative approach since the overall objective of this study \n\nfocuses on meanings and description of structural processes rather than on quantifiable \n\nphenomena or the measurement of specific variables (Patton, 2002, pp. 13-14). In order to \n\norganize and evaluate the acquired data in a systematic way, several frameworks and tools \n\nfrom the field of Strategic Management have been applied, including PESTLE; Porter\u00b4s 5 \n\nForces; VRION; SMART; SWOT; and SAVE. Additionally, basic summaries, graphs, \n\ndiagrams, charts and tables summarize and visualize the major outcomes. \n\n1.4 Project Structure  \n\nThe present project is divided into 12 chapters. The introduction (chapter 1) gives an \n\ninsight into the topic, research objective, methodology and provides information about the \n\ncurrent state of research. Chapter 2 covers the macro business environment of Brazil \n\nincluding political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental aspects. Chapter \n\n3 focuses on the dynamics of the Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry by analyzing market \n\nsize, growth rates, market segments and competition. In the fourth chapter the resources and \n\ncapabilities of Friesland Kabel will be identified and evaluated according to their competitive \n\npotential. \n\nThe second part of the project begins with an introduction in strategy formulation (Chapter \n\n5) and the definition of Friesland Kabel\u00b4s mission, vision and objectives (Chapter 6). \n\nAfterwards, the overall strategic situation is investigated by applying the SWOT framework \n\n(Chapter 7). On this basis, strategic responses will be elaborated (Chapter 8.) including \n\nmarket entry mode (Chapter 9.) and marketing concept (Chapter 10). Chapter 11 deals with \n\nthe implementation of the strategic choices. To this aim, an action plan is developed which \n\nlists all necessary activities and sets out a time frame for their implementation.  \n\nThe last chapter (Chapter12.) provides a summary of the key results and gives an outlook \n\nwith regard to the initial questions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Structure and Organization (Own Presentation, 2014) \n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nMarket Potential \n\nChapter 2 \n\nMacro Environment Analysis \n\nChapter 3 \n\nIndustry Structure Analysis \n\nChapter 4 \n\nInternal Analysis \n\n Chapter 5 \n\nStrategy Formulation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMarket Entry Strategy  \n\nChapter 6 \n\nMission Vision &amp; Objektives \n\nChapter 7 \n\nSWOT Analysis \n\nChapter 8 \n\nStrategic Actions \n\nChapter 9 \n\nMarket Entry Mode \n\nChapter 10 \n\nMarketing Plan \n\nChapter 11 \n\nStrategic Action Plan \n\nChapter 12: Summary and Outlook \n\n \n\n1.5 State of Research \n\nThe theoretical framework of this project is based on concepts and theories from \n\ninternational strategic management literature. In the context of globalization, this field of \n\nstudy is well researched and saw rapid growth during the last three decades (Lu, 2003, p. \n\n193). A range of strategic management publications divides the internationalization process of \n\nbusiness organizations into three or four phases including: (1) analysis of the external and \n\ninternal environment; (2) strategy formulation; (3) strategy implementation and (4) strategy \n\nevaluation (Hill, et al., 2013, p. 11); (Hitt, et al., 2009, p. 6) or (Johnson, et al., 2008, p. 49). \n\nFor the strategic assessment of macroeconomic environments, research refers to political, \n\neconomic, social, technological, legal and environmental aspects of markets. In particular, an \n\nemphasis is placed on the questions how these aspects influence the overall market potential \n\nand determine investment decisions of organizations (Johnson, et al., 2008, pp. 54-55) or \n\n(Piercy, 2012, p. 396).  \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nDue to the changing role of emerging markets, research interest is increasingly attracted by \n\nBrazil\u2019s macro business environment. Most of the publications on this topic are country \n\nprofiles from an external market seeking perspective and point out the country\u00b4s economic \n\nstability as well as its different sources of transaction costs (World Bank, 2014c), (CIA, 2014) \n\nor (BTI, 2014).  \n\nThe Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry is also integrated into this research area. \n\nArticles and reports of the past years show the importance of the sector for the country\u00b4s \n\neconomic prosperity and emphasize its growth potential (Enst &amp; Young, 2012) or (BNDES, \n\n2014). An important source for current industry information is the Brazilian National Agency \n\nof Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP, 2014a) which provides continuously updated \n\nfigures and statistics. \n\nData and information about the Brazilian shipbuilding and marine equipment industry is \n\nlimited to only a few sources. Particular mention should be made of the biannual market \n\nstudies performed by the Brazilian Association of Naval Construction and Offshore \n\nCompanies (SINAVAL, 2015). \n\nResearch about internal environments deals with capabilities and resources of \n\norganizations and provides diagnostic tools in order to identify and evaluate the strengths and \n\nweaknesses of organizations. Common assessment criteria are therefore the ability to create \n\ncompetitive advantage and the relative cost position against competitors (Peng, 2009, p. 78); \n\n(Barney, 1991, p. 99) or (Hitt, et al., 2009, p. 67).  \n\nInternational strategy formulation is described as a process to determine how organizations \n\nenter a certain market. A range of literature specifies alternative components of this process, \n\nincluding mission and vision statements, the setting of corporate objectives, the entry mode \n\nselection, marketing strategies and the development of strategic actions (Hill, et al., 2013, p. \n\n11); (Perlitz, 2004, p. 64) or (Kotler &amp; Keller, 2012, p. 48).  \n\nLiterature about missions, visions and objectives particularly highlights their relevance to the \n\nevaluation of business activities and to the determination of the overall goals of organizations. \n\nAdditionally, several authors define key elements and provide formal criteria in order to \n\ndefine such statements (Hitt, et al., 2007, p. 19); (Baldegger, 2012, pp. 145-147)  or (Doran, et \n\nal., 1981, pp. 35-36). \n\nWhen it comes to the question of how to fulfill a company\u2019s mission, vision and \n\nobjectives, the academic research proposes the elaboration of strategic actions. These are \n\nusually defined as the allocation of resources and commitment. Basic concepts underlying the \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nimplementation of strategic actions generally aim to maximize the competitive advantage of \n\norganizations by translating external and internal starting conditions into specific strategic \n\ndecisions (Andersen, 2013, pp. 64-66) or (Griffin &amp; Fleet, 2014, p. 157). \n\nA fundamental question of the market entry mode is the degree of internationalization \n\nranging between national diversification and global orientation (Bartlett &amp; Goshal, 1989, p. \n\n58) or (Buckley &amp; Casson, 1998, pp. 541-543). Based on this dichotomy, different types of \n\nmarket entry modes are distinguished. Additionally, several approaches provide criteria for \n\nthe selection between the alternative modes (Root, 1994, p. 41). \n\nIn the academic inquiry of international strategic development, the marketing plan is one of \n\nthe basic elements (Root, 1994, p. 4). Marketing strategies are usually separated into different \n\ndecision areas. The most common framework is the 4P-model (McCarthy, 1960, p. 45). \n\nHowever, depending on specific business environments, other approaches are proposed \n\n(Ettenson, et al., 2013) or (Shimizu, 1989, pp. 63-102).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n2 Macro Business Environment of Brazil: PESTLE-Analysis \n\nBusiness organizations are embedded into an external environment which is determined by \n\nthe geographical area in which they operate (Johnson, et al., 2008, pp. 54-55). According to \n\nKotler, the \u201cmacro environment includes forces that create opportunities and pose threat to the \n\nbusiness units\u201d (Jain, et al., 2011, p. 10). Companies doing business abroad must consider the \n\nparticular conditions of the host country in addition to their domestic environment (Francis, \n\n2010, p. 57).  \n\nThere are several approaches for assessing environmental forces. For the following \n\ninvestigation the PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal and \n\nenvironmental) analysis has been selected since it includes all dimensions which are relevant \n\nto the present project.  \n\nIn implementing this framework, only those environmental aspects which have a potential \n\nimpact on Friesland Kabel\u00b4s business activities have been considered. The data used \n\noriginates mainly from international reports, rankings and indices since these types of sources \n\nenable an inter-country comparison.  \n\n2.1 Political Factors \n\nThe Federative Republic of Brazil is a stable growing democracy with a sustainable \n\ninstitutional system. After the re-election of President Dilma Rousseff in October 2014 the \n\ncenter-left party PT is expected to continuously stay in power for 16 years.  \n\nBrazil has no political enemies, no ethnic or cultural conflicts and faces no threat of \n\nterrorism. This is a particular advantage compared to other oil and gas producing regions and \n\ncountries such as North Africa, the Gulf region or Russia where political uncertainties have \n\nconsiderable impacts on the industry. \n\nDuring the last two years, national protests, directed mainly against the poor public \n\nservices, corruption and the management of the PT government, increasingly took place. \n\nSince recently, Dilma Rousseff no longer has the support of the population, of which more \n\nthan two-thirds are calling for her impeachment (Telles, 2015, pp. 7-14).  \n\nAccording to the political risk index by the PRS Group, Brazil is ranked on 59th out of 100 \n\ninvestigated countries (The PRS Group, 2015).  \n\nIn the following, the most significant political factors from a business perspective will be \n\nbriefly explained: \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nCorruption: Despite the introduction of several new legal measures such as the Anti-\n\nBribery Law (Presid\u00eancia da Rep\u00fablica, 2013), Brazil`s corruption continues to be an obstacle \n\nfor business. Due to the federal structure and special legal standing of legislators, companies \n\nand businesspeople are increasingly facing corruption by public officials (Business Anti-\n\nCorruption Portal, 2014). According to the corruption perception index by Transparency \n\nInternational, Brazil is ranked number 69 out of 175 countries. (International Transperency, \n\n2014). \n\n \n\n Taxation: The Brazilian tax system is complicated and fragmented, which leads to time-\n\nconsuming processes of overcoming administrative burdens and to high uncertainty in fiscal \n\nmatters (Rabobank, 2014). According to the World Bank, the Brazilian tax system is ranked at \n\nnumber 175 among 189 countries (World Bank, 2014a). Another study by PwC, World Bank \n\nand the International Finance Corporation (IFC) concluded that Brazil possesses the most \n\ntime-consuming tax system worldwide (PwC, 2014, p. 21).  \n\n \n\nBureaucracy: Start-ups in Brazil face huge bureaucratic challenges. In the category \n\n\u201cStarting a Business\u201d of the World Bank report, Brazil is ranked at 123 out of 189 economies \n\n(World Bank, 2014a). During the last years, 40% of Brazilian start-ups did not survive their \n\nthird year on the market (VEJA, 2012). This is mainly due to the legal and regulatory \n\ncomplexity in the country, which negatively affects the efficiency of the public administration \n\nand economic operators. It is estimated that Brazil`s bureaucracy annually generates a total \n\ncost of R$ 46.3 billion (FIESP, 2015, p. 1).  \n\n2.2 Economic Factors \n\nBrazil is considered a solid and sustainable economy in the medium term. With a gross \n\ndomestic product (GDP) of $ 2.346 trillion in 2014, the country is currently the seventh \n\nlargest economy in the world and the biggest economic power in Latin America (Bradesco, \n\n2015, p. 62). \n\nFDI in Brazil has steadily increased during the last years. This is mainly due to a stronger \n\nmarket orientation, by which several public enterprises have been privatized and trade barriers \n\nhave been reduced. In 2014, FDI in Brazil totaled $ 62,5 billion, which corresponds to 2.7% \n\nof the GDP (Bradesco, 2015, p. 62). According to the Foreign Direct Investment Confidence \n\nIndex, in the same year Brazil was the fifth-most attractive market for FDI (A.T. Kearney, \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n2014, p. 1). The biggest investment sectors in the country include agriculture, infrastructure, \n\nconstruction and oil and gas (BNDES, 2014, p. 2). \n\nNevertheless, Brazil is currently affected by a deep economic recession. The GDP has \n\nfallen from 2,7 % in 2013 to 0,1% in 2014 and is estimated to decline to \u20131,8 % in 2015 \n\n(Bradesco, 2015, p. 62). The effects are rapidly increasing unemployment rates, weak \n\nconsumption and decreasing tax receipts. Moreover, rising inflation and currency depreciation \n\nare increasing the government\u00b4s debt (The Economist, 2015). As a result, at the end of august \n\n2015, President Dilma Rousseff submitted a loss-making budget proposal for the first time in \n\nthe history of Brazil. According to the news agency Ag\u00eancia Brasil, the estimated structural \n\nprimary deficit for the year 2016 corresponds to 0,5% of the GDP (Ag\u00eancia Brasil, 2015).  \n\nIn the following the most important economic causes and consequences of this crisis will \n\nbe explained in more detail: \n\n \n\nInfrastructure: According to the 2013-2014 Global Competitiveness Report, infrastructure \n\nin Brazil is the biggest obstacle for business investors (Schwab &amp; Sala-i-Martin, 2013, p. 38). \n\nThis applies to both local transportation, including air traffic, ports, road and railways and \n\ninternational trading operations. According to the FGV institute, about 100 forms and 900 \n\npieces of information are required in order to import a container into Brazil. Another study \n\nshows that importing a container into Brazil costs about US$ 2215. Compared to other \n\nemerging countries (e.g. China US$ 500 or Chile US$ 795), this amount is significantly above \n\nthe average (Rabobank, 2014, p. 3). \n\n \n\nLabor and Employment: There is a shortage of technical and skilled labor in Brazil. \n\nAccording to the \u201cTalent Shortage Global Survey 2015\u201d, Brazil was the fourth worst scoring \n\ncountry, having difficulty in filling vacancies in the 42 surveyed labor markets \n\n(ManpowerGroup, 2015, p. 7). Moreover, the OECD study \u201cEducation at a Glance 2013\u201d \n\nshows a lack of qualified educated people in Brazil. Only 10% of the population has a post-\n\nsecondary degree, against 15% in Mexico and 25% in Chile (OECD, 2013, p. 28). \n\nFurther restrictions refer to the rigid labor legislation, which leads to high uncertainty, \n\ninformal employment relationships and increased labor costs compared to other emerging \n\ncountries (Gill, et al., 2002, p. 221). \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nInflation: 1 US$ is worth R$ 3,90055 (Oanda, 2015) today (19.09.2015). Since 2014, the \n\nReal has depreciated around 30% against the Dollar (Borges, 2015). According to the Big \n\nMac Index, the Real is the third most overheated currency (Big Mac Index, 2015), a fact \n\nwhich has particularly negative impacts for importing countries.  \n\nDue to the low purchasing power of the currency, inflation remains high in the country. \n\nThe average inflation in 2014 amounted to 6.4%. For this reason, the Central Bank of Brazil \n\n(Banco Central do Brazil) raised the so-called SELIC interest rate to 11,75%. Overall, with \n\naround 5.35%, Brazil thus had one of the highest real interest rates worldwide (Bradesco, \n\n2015, p. 2). \n\n2.3 Social Factors \n\nThe Brazilian society is highly diverse in terms ethnic groups and cultural background. It is \n\nestimated that currently 202,656,788 people live in Brazil, with an annual growth rate of \n\n0.8%. The medium age of the population is relatively young at 30.7 years (CIA, 2014). \n\nBetween 2003 and 2014, about 47,7 million Brazilians have risen into the \u201cnew middle class\u201d \n\nwhich is estimated to encompass around 112 million people (Secretaria de Assuntos \n\nEstrat\u00e9gicos da Presid\u00eancia da Presid\u00eancia da Rep\u00fablica, 2014, pp. 24-25). \n\nIn parallel to this, poverty fell from 20% in 2004 to 7% in 2009, while extreme poverty \n\ndropped from 10% to 4%. Income inequality also decreased steadily. From 2001 to 2009, the \n\nincome of the poorest 10% of the population grew by 7% per year, while the income rate of \n\nrichest 10% amounted to 1.7% (BTI, 2014, p. 13). Accordingly, Brazil\u00b4s GINI index \n\nimproved from 54.52 in 2008 to 51.9 in 2012, and the Human Development Index (HDI) has \n\nalso risen continually during the last years (Pieterse &amp; Cardoso, 2014, p. 2). \n\n The educational system in Brazil is characterized by an overall low level and limited \n\naccess opportunities (Souza, 2011, pp. 8-9). According to the Program for International \n\nStudent Assessment (PISA), Brazil performs below the average in mathematics (rank: 57/64), \n\nreading (rank: 55/56) and science (rank 58/60) (OECD, 2012). In contrast, the rate of people \n\nwith primary education increased from 34.5% in 1995 to 61.7% in 2009 (Inequality Watch, \n\n2012). \n\nRobbery, rape, fraud, and residential thefts remain at critical levels in Brazil. According to \n\nthe 2013 Brazilian Yearbook of Public Security, the national homicides rate amounted to 24.3 \n\nvictims against 6.9 of the global average. However, in some main cities and business centers, \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nsuch as Rio de Janeiro or S\u00e3o Paulo, the crime situation has improved significantly compared \n\nto previous years (Getulio Vagas Foundation, 2014, p. 7).  \n\n2.4 Technological Factors  \n\nScience, technology and innovation are key elements for Brazil\u00b4s economic development. \n\nBrazil is a world leader in agribusiness and a pioneer in biodiesel production. Additionally, \n\nthe country plays a major role in the airplane and submarine industry, space research, deep \n\nwater oil &amp; gas exploration, telecommunications and software design. Thus, Brazil possesses \n\na comprehensive technological infrastructure consisting of governmental departments, \n\nresearch centers and business organizations (OECD, 2011, p. 144). Brazil\u00b4s overall innovation \n\nstrategy is based on the action plan \u201cPlano Brasil Maior\u201d (Plano Brasil Maior, 2014) which \n\npursues three main objectives: (1) The reduction of foreign technology import, (2) the support \n\nof Brazil\u2019s know-how in nature-related fields and (3) the development of the national research \n\nsystem.  \n\nNevertheless, Brazil is still highly dependent on foreign innovation and technology. The \n\ntechnological transfer is controlled by the patent office Instituto Nacional da Propriedade \n\nIndustrial (INPI), an institution which is authorized to approve all technological cross-border \n\nagreements (INIPI, 2014). \n\nBrazil\u2019s research and innovation indicators show significant developments over the last \n\nyears. The country produces 10 times more PhDs (500.000 a year) than two decades ago and \n\nis among the 15 largest producers of scientific publications in the world (SCImago Journal \n\nand Country Rank, 2014). The research and development expenditure (% of GDP) of 1.21% \n\nin 2011 was the highest share among all Latin American countries (World Bank, 2014b) and \n\nin terms of the information and communication technology (ICT), Brazil achieved the 60\nth\n\n \n\nplace out of 148 economies worldwide in the Network Readiness Index (NRI) (Schwab, et al., \n\n2013, p. 23). \n\nIn recent years the Brazilian Government has initiated several efforts in order to improve \n\nthe conditions of intellectual property (IP) rights. To this end, it has set up different national \n\ninstitutions such as the Conselho Nacional de Combate \u00e0 Pirataria (=National Council for \n\nCombating Piracy and Intellectual Property). In the International Property Rights Index Brazil \n\nis ranked at 46 out of 96 countries (Soto, 2014). \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n2.5 Legal Factors \n\nThe principal source of Brazilian law is the Civil Code, which was enacted in 2002, \n\nreplacing the 1916 code. Codes that specifically refer to business issues are the labor law, \n\ncompany law, consumer rights and contract and property law (Neto, 2013, pp. 3-22). The \n\nBrazilian legal system is highly complex. Enforcing contracts is time-consuming and \n\narbitration is a common procedure for resolving commercial conflicts. For this reason, foreign \n\ninvestors should use international laws or engage a local lawyer.  \n\nIn 2014 Brazil acceded to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International \n\nSale of Goods (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 2014). FDI is \n\nregulated by the law 4131/62. In general, Brazilian law does not prohibit FDI, but in certain \n\nindustry sectors, including communications, media, public utilities and transportation, foreign \n\nownership is strongly limited. (Ernst &amp; Young, 2011, pp. 7-8). Every FDI is obligated to be \n\nregistered in the online electronic system of the Central Bank, called Electronic Registration \n\nof Foreign Direct Investments (RDE-IED), within 30 days (Banco Central do Brasil, 2014, p. \n\n9).  \n\nAccording to the New Brazilian Civil Code (NBCC), there are no additional restrictions for \n\nforeign ownership of real estate property. The Brazilian law knows 9 different types of \n\nbusiness entities. The most common forms of establishing subsidiaries are a liability company \n\n(limitada) or cooperation (Sociedade An\u00f4nima). There are some obstacles for entrepreneurs to \n\nincorporating and registering a company in Brazil. As already mentioned before, registration \n\nprocedures require a lot of time and can involve high costs. Further information including all \n\nrequired procedures can be viewed in the \u201cDoing Business Report of the World Bank\u201d (World \n\nBank, 2014c) . \n\nThe major legislation norm regularizing labor activities in Brazil is the Consolida\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nLeis do Trablaho. Labor legislation in Brazil is complex and guarantees certain rights and \n\nbenefits to employees, including regulation of working hours, vacations, salary, notice \n\nperiods, transportation and meals (Presid\u00eancia da Rep\u00fablica, 1943). This is why labor costs \n\nare relatively high in comparison with other emerging markets.  \n\n2.6 Environmental Factors \n\nAs the world's fifth largest country, Brazil possesses a high diversity of natural resources. \n\nThe country\u2019s economic and financial status is extremely dependent on these products, which \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\ncontribute to three major industries: (1) raw materials, (2) energy and (3) agriculture \n\n(Katsioloudes, 2011, p. 362). \n\nNevertheless, the country faces different environmental problems including deforestation, \n\nspecies distinction, air and water pollution, land degradation and oil spills (CIA, 2014). In \n\norder to preserve its resources, the Brazilian Government has adopted different policies and \n\nset up several regulatory organizations. The main monitoring authority in this regard is the \n\nBrazilian Environment and Natural Resources Institute (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio \n\nAmbiente - IBAMA), which establishes and controls anti-pollution standards. The Brazilian \n\nlaw punishes environmental crimes strictly and contamination of the soil, water or air \n\ngenerally leads to civil and criminal prosecution (Presid\u00eancia da Rep\u00fablica, 1998) .  \n\nAs the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, Brazil increasingly came under \n\npressure to assume global responsibility. In this context, the country has ratified several \n\ninternational environmental agreements as the Kyoto protocol and hosted the United Nations \n\nConference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as Rio+20 (Fausto &amp; Fausto, \n\n2014, pp. 399-400) . \n\n2.7 Business Implications \n\nIn summary, the Brazilian business environment remains diversified. Based on favorable \n\nmacroeconomic factors including a high occurrence of natural resources, population growth \n\nand economic potential, Brazil is currently one of the most sought-after investment \n\ndestinations worldwide. Moreover, in aspects such as social equity and political stability, the \n\ncountry has shown great improvements during the last years.  \n\nHowever, Brazil still exhibits significant business constraints. In this context, the term \n\n\u201cCusto Brasil\u201d stands for the competitiveness problem of operational extra cost making \n\nBrazilian goods and services more expensive compared to those of other (emerging) countries \n\n(Parra-Bernal, et al., 2011).  \n\nIt is possible to reduce some of these \u201ccosts\u201d through good preparation. This is the reason \n\nwhy Brazil is not the right market for short-term profit-making. By contrast, long-term \n\ncommitment and seeking economies of scale are key success factors for ensuring high return \n\nof investment.  \n\nWhere the individual influence is low, investors have no other option than to be patient. In \n\nthis context, Julio Ramundo, director of the BNDES observed that:  \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\u201cSixty years ago, this country was not much more than a glorified coffee plantation but \n\nwe have brought many new businesses through since then. There are very good \n\nopportunities in Brazil. Just don\u2019t be put off if you have to have more than six meetings. \n\nWe like to date\u201d (Booth, 2013). \n\n \n\nFor a better overview the table below presents the business opportunities and threats \n\nanalyzed in this chapter. The classification of the PEST model is still maintained. \n\nAdditionally, the factors were evaluated based on their potential business implications for \n\nFriesland Kabel\u00b4s market entry. Generally, environmental factors are assessed on two \n\ndimensions: First, according to the probability of occurrence and second according to the \n\nstrength of the impact (Piercy, 2012, p. 396). The rating scale categories range from \u201c1\u201d to \n\n\u201c3\u201d. Challenges assessed as 3 have the most negative impact for Friesland Kabel. Likewise, \n\nopportunities evaluated as \u201c3\u201d provide great potentials. By contrast, factors rated with \u201c1\u201d \n\ncorrespond to small challenges or limited opportunities. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nTable 2: Macro Environmental Factors and Business Implications (Own Presentation, 2014) \n\n RANK OPPORTUNITIES RANK THREATS \n\nP \n\n3 No military conflicts 3 Bureaucracy \n\n2 Stable and sustainable democracy 3 Corruption \n\n  2 Taxation \n\n  2 Mass demonstrations \n\nE \n\n3 7th largest economy 2 High inflation \n\n3 Well-developed market segments \n\n(e.g. oil &amp; gas industry) \n\n2 High interest rate \n\n  1 Lack of labor \n\n  2 Poor infrastructure \n\n \n\n  3 Economic crisis \n\n \n\n  2 Unstable currency \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3 Large population 1 Crime \n\n3 Rising middle class 1 Education \n\n  1 Poverty \n\n  1 Social inequality \n\n \n\n  1 Social unrest \n\nT \n2 Demand for technology 1 Property rights \n\n2 Technological infrastructure   \n\nL \n2 Few restrictions for FDI and \n\nforeign real estate ownership \n\n2 Complex legal environment \n\n(e.g. labor legislation) \n\nE 3 Natural resources 1 Environmental problems \n\n          3 = Great challenges and opportunities \n\n          2= Moderate challenges and opportunities \n\n          1= Small challenges and limited opportunities \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n3 Industry Analysis \n\nAfter this outline of the macro environmental forces, in a next step the focus will be \n\nnarrowed to the industry. Similar to the macro environment, the dynamics of a given industry \n\nalso determine the scope of business organizations. However, industry forces are more \n\nconcentrated and have a more direct impact on enterprises. Conversely, business \n\norganizations also have more influence on the industry variables than on macro environmental \n\nforces (Gimbert, 2011, pp. 46-47). For those reasons, industry analyses are important \n\nmeasures for companies when it comes to market entry and strategic decisions.   \n\n The overall aim of this chapter is to assess the market potential for Friesland Kabel within \n\nthe Brazilian oil and gas industry and its relevant segments. Therefore, the study includes the \n\nfollowing issues:  \n\n \n\n? Overview of the development of the Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry: How \n\nattractive is the Brazilian offshore oil and gas sector in general and on an \n\ninternational comparison? \n\n? Identification of Friesland Kabel\u00b4s product segment: Which segments within the supply \n\nchain correspond to the products and services of the company? \n\n? Assessment of the competitive environment: What are the key competitive factors that \n\nmost affect the industry? \n\n3.1 The Brazilian Oil and Gas Industry: Current Scenario and Perspective \n\nThe Brazilian oil and gas sector is experiencing a defining moment of new opportunities \n\nand challenges. In the past 20 years, oil and natural gas reserves in Brazil have, in total, \n\nincreased by 164% (AHK; GTAI, 2013, p. 12). With an expected investment volume of R$ \n\n509 billion (ca. US$ 130 billion) between 2015 and 2018, the oil and gas industry is one of \n\nthe largest investment sectors of the country (BNDES, 2014, p. 139). At a constant high \n\nproduction level over the last year, in December 2014 a new record of 2.497 million barrels \n\noil per day (bpd) and 598 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) natural gas was reached (see figure 1) \n\n(ANP, 2014a, p. 11). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Oil and Gas Production over Time (in million bpd) (ANP, 2015) \n\n \n\n \n\nWith regard to further unexploited sources, Brazil is expected to become one of the major \n\nglobal oil and gas producers. It is estimated that in the next 20 years, Brazil will rise to the \n\nfourth biggest oil and gas producing country worldwide after the U.S.A., Saudi Arabia and \n\nRussia (see figure 2) and produce nearly 5% of the world\u2019s oil supply (AHK; GTAI, 2013, p. \n\n20).  \n\nBased on industrial growth and a growing middle class, Brazil is also gaining importance \n\nas a sales market. It is forecasted that with an increase of 29% in demand, the oil and gas \n\nconsumption in the country will account for approximately 4% of the global demand in 2020 \n\n(Enst &amp; Young, 2012, p. 21). \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Forecast of Oil Production by Countries (US Energy Information Administration, 2013) \n\n \n\n1,500\n\n1,700\n\n1,900\n\n2,100\n\n2,300\n\n2,500\n\n2,700\n\n2,900\n\nNatural Gas\n\nOil\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n2013 2015 2020 2025 2030\n\nSaudi-Arabia\n\nUSA\n\nRussia\n\nChaina\n\nIran\n\nUAE\n\nKuwait\n\nCanada\n\nMexico\n\nBrazil\n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nDespite this positive outlook, the Brazilian oil and gas sector is currently facing a number \n\nof challenges. Apart from the global drop of the oil prices, key players on the market, such as \n\nthe biggest national oil producer Petrobras, are involved in different corruption affairs. Over \n\nseveral years, managers of the company have taken bribes amounting to billions. The result of \n\nthis is that thousands of contracts with suppliers and construction companies must be \n\nreconsidered and renegotiated. In this scenario, many supplier companies have already closed \n\ndown and about 20.000 employees of the industry have been dismissed. According to the \n\nestimations of the Federal Police, the costs of Petrobras which are directly related to the \n\ncorruption incidents amount to about R$ 19 billion (ca. US$ 5 billion) (Globo, 2015). Against \n\nthis background, the company has reduced its investment plan for the next 4 years by 37 % \n\n(Petrobras, 2015, p. 8).  \n\n3.2 National Actors \n\n3.2.1 ANP  \n\nThe Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) is the \n\ncentral regulatory organ that monitors oil, natural gas and biofuel activities in Brazil. Linked \n\nto the Ministry of Mines, the ANP sets national policies and announces bidding rounds for oil \n\nand gas resources (ANP, 2014b).  \n\n3.2.2 Petrobras &amp; Transpetro \n\nPetrobras is a publicly traded company whose major stakeholder is the Government of \n\nBrazil. As an integrated energy company, Petrobras operates in different sectors including \n\nexploration and production, refining, marketing, transportation, petrochemicals, oil product \n\ndistribution, natural gas, electricity, chemical gas, and biofuels (Petrobras, 2014a, p. 1). With \n\nits share of 79% of the total national investment in the sector, Petrobras is by far the biggest \n\noil and gas company in Brazil (Camerini, 2014, p. 6). Transpetro, a subsidiary of Petrobras \n\nspecializes in transportation and logistics activities (Transpetro, 2014). \n\n3.2.3 Private Producer \n\nApart from Petrobras, the remaining market share is distributed between a few private \n\ncompanies and multinationals. The table below shows the biggest 5 producer according to \n\ntheir production volume. \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nTable 3: Top 5-Producer 2014 (ANP,2014) \n\nCompany Production (boe/d) \n\nPetrobras 2.402.640 \n\nStatoil Brasil 77.231 \n\nShell Brasil 47.690 \n\nParna\u00edba G\u00e1s 37.954 \n\nChevron Frade 17.279 \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Private Industry Organizations \n\nPrivate organizations which represent companies of the Brazilian oil gas industry include \n\nthe National Organization of the Oil Industry (ONIP) and the Brazilian Institute for Oil, Gas \n\nand Biofuels (IBP). ONIP is a non-profit organization which serves as a communication and \n\ncooperation forum between companies, suppliers and government agencies involved in the \n\nBrazilian oil and gas sector (ONIP, 2014).  \n\nIBP is a private association with 200 member companies. The main objective of IBP is to \n\nsupport the sustainability, competitiveness and the social responsibility of the national oil, gas \n\nand biofuels industry. (IBP, 2014).  \n\n3.3 The Offshore Oil and Gas Sector: Pre-Salt \n\n3.3.1 Geographical Overview \n\nThe total Brazilian offshore oil and gas reserves consist of ca. 7% of Shallow Water (0-\n\n300m); 48% of Deep Water (300 \u2013 1500 m) and 45% of Ultra Deep Water fields (> 1500m) \n\n(Pinho, 2014, p. 4). \u201cPre-Salt\u201d fields are oil and gas deposits that lie below under thick layers \n\nof salt, in areas of approximately 7.000 meter below the sea.  \n\nThe largest part of the pre-salt reserves is located ca. 300 km off the Brazilian South \n\nEastern coast and extends across 5 federal states, from Esp\u00edrito Santo over Rio de Janeiro and \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo to Paran\u00e1 and Santa Catarina. The total pre-salt area discovered to date is estimated \n\nat 149,000 square kilometers (Petrobras, 2014e). Figure 3 provides an overview of the \n\ngeographical location of the fields. In addition, a more detailed map is provided in appendix 6. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Oil and Gas Production in Brazil (Adapted from Enst &amp; Young, 2012) \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Market Size and Growth \n\nThe dynamic growth of the Brazilian oil and gas industry is mainly based on the discovery \n\nof offshore deep-water pre-salt fields. Research by Petrobras has shown that more than half of \n\nthe global oil and gas sources discovered between 2005 and 2010 are located in the deep sea. \n\nOut of these, 62% belong to Brazil (AHK; GTAI, 2013, p. 15). Additionally, the ANP \n\nestimates that of the approximately 14.7 billion barrel of officially proven oil reserves at the \n\nend of 2013, 94% are from offshore sources. (ANP, 2013). It is supposed that the already \n\ndiscovered sources represent only a small percentage of the actual volume. The overall \n\nquantity of the seep-sea sources is estimated at 50-70 billion barrels. Between January 2013 \n\nand February 2014, 38 new offshore sources were discovered, 14 of them in the pre-salt. \n\nCurrently, 100% of all drillings lead to new findings. The table below provides an overview \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nof basins with their respective volumes and number of production facilities (ANP, 2014a, p. \n\n23).  \n\nTable 4: Distribution of the Oil &amp; Gas Production by Basin (ANP,2014) \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Business Opportunities \n\nAgainst the background of the deep-water oil and gas exploration there is a high demand \n\nfor innovation and technology in this sector. Local content regulations set by the government \n\nare supposed to meet the most of the requirements by domestic resources. However, due to \n\ntechnological gaps and limited local expertise, the production volume cannot be achieved \n\nwithout foreign contribution. \n\nFor this reason, manufacturers of products and providers of services which cannot be \n\ncovered by local content will be specifically sought abroad in order to establish joint ventures \n\nwith domestic companies. One of these projects already started in 2014 under the \n\ncoordination of ONIP and the trade and investment promotion agency Apex Brasil (AHK; \n\nGTAI, 2014, pp. 13-14). In the first phase of these projects, potential Brazilian companies for \n\nstrategic partnerships will be selected.

(Appex Brasil, 2014a). \n\n3.4 Target Segment Definition  \n\nThe offshore oil and gas sector is a very complex and fragmented industry that includes a \n\nnumber of different processes. Thus, the objective of this section is to identify those industry \n\nsegments that will present the most opportunities for Friesland Kabel in terms of market \n\npotential and product suitability. This enables a more focused assessment of the relevant \n\nsegments in the further analysis.  \n\nTherefore, first a brief overview of the main segments of the offshore oil and gas supply \n\nchain and the products of Friesland Kabel will be presented. On this basis, it will then be \n\ndetermined which segments and products fit together. After that, the related sub-segments will \n\nbe analyzed according to market size and growth. \n\n3.4.1 The Offshore Oil and Gas Supply Chain \n\nThe offshore oil and gas supply-chain can basically be divided into three distinct segments: \n\nUpstream, Midstream, and Downstream. The upstream sector includes processes related to the \n\nexploration and production (E&amp;P) of oil and gas. Midstream processes refer to the processing \n\nand the transportation of the oil and gas to the refineries through tankers or pipelines. The \n\ndownstream industry covers the refining and the distribution of the products to the final \n\nconsumer (Harrison &amp; Hoek, 2008).    \n\n \n\n Figure 4: Offshore Oil and Gas Supply Chain  (Quintig, 2014) \n\n \n\nEXPLORATION PRODUCTION TRANSPORTATION PROCESSING REFINIING DISTRIBUTION \n\nUPSTREAM\n\n  \nMIDSTREAM DOWNSTREAM \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Product Definition \n\nFriesland Kabel is a distributor of wires, cables and network technology. The product \n\nrange covers five main categories: (1) marine cables; (2) industrial cables; (3) cable and \n\nwires; (4) wind cables and (5) data systems technology. Among these, the marine cables and \n\nnetwork technology specialized for offshore communication are the products that are most \n\nsuitable for the offshore oil and gas industry. This equipment can be mainly used in the \n\nupstream and midstream sector for offshore constructions including platforms, rigs and \n\nvessels.  \n\n3.4.3 Production and Development \n\nWith regard to future investments, the E&amp;P sector is by far the biggest and fastest growing \n\nsegment. According to the new Business and Management Plan of Petrobras, until 2019 83% \n\n(US$ 108,6 billion) of the company\u00b4s total investment is supposed to flow into E&amp;P activities \n\n(Petrobras, 2015, p. 8). This focus on E&amp;P is mainly due to the production expansion of the \n\npre-salt sources.  \n\nFigure 5: Investement from Petrbras 2015-2019 (Petrobras, 2015) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe bulk of the total expenditures for E&amp;P will be invested in the construction of plants \n\nand platforms. Most of these activities are outsourced and performed by specialized industrial \n\nservice providers and EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) companies (AHK; \n\nGTAI, 2014, p. 20). \n\nE&amp;P \n83% \n\nDownstream \n10% \n\nGas &amp; Power \n5% \n\nOther \nAreas \n\n2% \n\nINVESTMENT \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n3.4.4 Shipbuilding and Marine Equipment  \n\nDue to the fact that the shipbuilding sector depends to a large extent on orders from the oil \n\nand gas industry, the Brazilian shipyards, for the first time in 15 years, are undergoing a major \n\ncrisis. In the first half of 2015 around 14.000 employees were dismissed and the construction \n\norders in the shipyards dropped from 381 in 2014 to 279 ongoing projects (SINAVAL, 2015, \n\np. 2). At this point, the exact impact on the industry is difficult to predict. For that reason, \n\nboth the past and estimated future orders for offshore vessels including tankers (1.6.1); oil \n\nproduction platforms (1.62); offshore support vessels (1.6.3) and drilling rigs (1.6.4) will be \n\nbriefly presented in the following. \n\n3.4.5 Tankers \n\nIn 2014 Brazil had the third largest portfolio of orders for oil tankers in the world \n\n(Transpetro, 2014, p. 1). Tanker vessels are crucial for the transportation of oil from platforms \n\nto terminals on land and of oil products along the Brazilian coast. Within the framework of \n\nthe growth programs PROMEF and EBN, Brazil had planned to increase its tanker fleet by 88 \n\nnew vehicles until 2020, including 14 Suezmax, 8 Aframax, 4 Panamax, 38 Products, 8 gas \n\ntankers und 9 bunkers (AHK, 2014b, p. 20). \n\nDue to the decline in orders there are currently only 29 tankers under construction \n\n(SINAVAL, 2015, p. 4). The table below gives an overview of the recently confirmed \n\nprojects. \n\n \n\nTable 5: Order Position \u2013 Tankers (Sinaval, 2015) \n\nShipyard Local Type Qunat.

According to table 6 currently \n\nseven hulls are under construction and 10 production modules are ordered.

This number was \n\nrecently reduced to 19 units. To acquire additional financial resources, Sete Brasil established \n\npartnerships with Kawasaki (Japan) KeppelFels (Singapore), SembMarine Corp (Singapore), \n\nthe China Offshore Oil Engineering Corporation (COOEC) and the subsidiary Odebrecht Oil \n\nand Gas (see table 7) (SINAVAL, 2015, p. 7). \n\n \n\nTable 7: Order Position - Drilling Rigs (Sinaval, 2015) \n\nShipyard Quant.

According to recent information, currently only \n\n32 offshore support vessels (OSVs) are under construction. Moreover, it is expected that in \n\nthe context of Petrobras\u2019 new investment plan, already tendered projects will be renegotiated \n\nand postponed. The company\u00b4s objective is to reduce the present support vessel fleet by \n\naround 90 ships (SINAVAL, 2015, p. 5). \n\n \n\nTable 8: Order Position \u2013 OSV (Sinaval, 2015) \n\nShipyard Local Type Quant.

An overview of the main national shipbuilding locations and their \n\nproduction capacity can be gained from the table below.   \n\n \n\nTable 9: Main Brazilian Shipyards (Sinaval, 2014) \n\n \n\n3.4.10 Marine Cables &amp; Network Technology \n\nInformation about the demand for Friesland Kabels\u00b4s specific products can be derived from \n\nthe procurement lists for marine equipment (appendix 1-4) originally released by SINAVAL  \n\n(AHK; GTAI, 2014, pp. 44-50) and lists of Petrobras\u2019s supplying goods (Petrobras, 2014d). \n\nIn both types of documents, marine cables and individual parts of network technology can be \n\nfound. Nevertheless, it has to be taken into consideration that these documents were published \n\nbefore the crisis affected the shipbuilding sector and that at this time, no updated lists are \n\navailable. Thus, it must be assumed that, in line with the shipbuilding industry, the demand \n\nfor this kind of product has also declined. \n\nYARD STATE STEEL PROCESS \n\n(1,000 t. year) \n\nSIZE (1,000m\u00b2) \n\nEisa Rio de Janeiro 52 150 \n\nBrasFELS Rio de Janeiro 50 410 \n\nMau\u00e1 Rio de Janeiro 36 334 \n\nSTX OSV \n\nNiter\u00f3i \n\nRio de Janeiro 15 120 \n\nAlianca Rio de Janeiro 10 61 \n\nUTC Rio de Janeiro ? 112 \n\nWilson, Sons S\u00e3o Paulo 10 22 \n\nNavship Santa Catarina 15 175 \n\nRio Grande Rio Grande do Sul 30 100 \n\nQuip Rio Grande do Sul 0 70 \n\nAtl\u00e2ntico Sul Pernambuco 160 1.500 \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n3.5 Competitive Environment: Porter\u00b4s 5 Forces Analysis \n\nIdentifying the competitive environment of a given industry is crucial for companies in \n\norder to assess the long-term profitability of markets. An extensive strategic management \n\nframework for this purpose is the Porter\u00b4s 5 Forces model. This framework focuses on five \n\nforces that shape the overall competitive environment of an industry: (1) threat of new \n\nentrants; (2) bargaining power of buyers; (3) threat of substitute products or services; (4) \n\nbargaining power of suppliers and (5) rivalry among existing competitors. The stronger each \n\nof the forces is, the less profitable is the industry, the weaker these forces, the more attractive \n\nit is. The application of this model helps companies to recognize threats and opportunities and \n\nto develop appropriate strategic responses (Porter, 2008a, pp. 36-46). \n\nBased on the Porter\u00b4s 5 Forces framework, the following analysis investigates how the \n\ncompetitive environment of the Brazilian oil and gas industry influences the profitability of \n\nFriesland Kabel in the market. In this connection, it must be noted that, depending on the \n\nforce and the sub-factors affecting the company, the analysis covers different levels of the \n\nindustry, ranging from the entire sector to the specific product segment of Friesland Kabel. \n\nFurthermore, only such factors will be considered which constitute particularities of the \n\nBrazilian oil and gas market or have a potential impact on the Friesland Kabel\u00b4s business \n\nactivities.  \n\n3.5.1 Threat of New Entrants \n\nThe threat of entry depends on the presence and height of entry barriers (Porter, 2008a, p. \n\n3). Entry barriers are an advantage to firms that already operate in a given market. For a new \n\nentrant such as Friesland Kabel, entry barriers represent a challenge.  \n\nThe major obstacle within the Brazilian oil and gas industry are local content policies. As \n\nmentioned above, the Brazilian Government puts great emphasis on the preservation of \n\nnational contribution within the oil and gas industry. The objective of this prospective policy \n\nis to integrate national suppliers and to promote domestic know-how. In order to obtain \n\noperation rights in the oil and gas supply chain, companies are required to pass several \n\nbidding rounds on the basis of cash bonus, work program and local content (Tordo, et al., \n\n2011, p. 89). In these rounds, the ANP sets the minimum acceptable share of local content and \n\nmonitors the compliance. Additionally, the agency has established a certification system in \n\nwhich accredited certifiers determine the local content required for particular goods or \n\nservices. Depend on the product and segment, local content requirements vary significantly. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nFor instance, E&amp;P in the pre-salt area are subjected to particularly strict regulations (85 to 95 \n\n% by 2020). This also includes ships, offshore units and marine equipment.  \n\nAs a consequence, national oil and gas companies have adopted local content policies in \n\ntheir operating strategies. For instance, suppliers who want to provide services and products to \n\nPetrobras are, among other criteria that have to be fulfilled, also assessed according to their \n\nlocal content (Barroso &amp; Macedo, 2010, p. 65). \n\n3.5.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers  \n\nPowerful buyers are able to bargain prices, demand better quality and services and possess \n\nnegotiation leverages relative to other actors of the industry (Porter, 2008a, p. 7).  \n\nAs it is common in the oil and gas sector, in Brazil there is also one single dominating \n\nactor on the market (monopsony). Petrobras concentrates 79% of the total investments \n\n(Camerini, 2014, p. 6). This privileged position allows the company to control competition, \n\nselect its vendors and set contractual conditions (Beato &amp; Benavides, 2004, p. 97).  \n\nFor Friesland Kabel, it is difficult to compensate this market power. The product type of \n\nthe firm does not leave much room for differentiation, which means that Petrobras faces few \n\nswitching costs between other suppliers. Nevertheless, the products present some favorable \n\nproperties (more detailed information in chapter 4). In this connection, it has to be considered \n\nthat the oil and gas industry is highly service-intensive. Due to the potential costs of \n\nbreakdowns, service is more relevant than financial investments (Reynolds &amp; Lancaste, 2002, \n\np. 202).  \n\n3.5.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers \n\nPowerful suppliers affect the industry by charging higher prices, limiting production and \n\nservices, or shifting costs to industry participants (Porter, 2008a, p. 6).  \n\nFriesland Kabel is a cable distributor which obtains the completed products from one \n\nsingle producer. This is why the company, even on other markets such as Brazil, does not \n\nrequire additional suppliers. \n\n3.5.4 Threat of Substitutes \n\nThe availability of substitute products or services limits the profitability of an industry \n\n(Porter, 2008a, p. 8).  \n\nFor marine cables and offshore network technology, only a few substitutes could be \n\nidentified which are relatively similar in terms of type, quality and price. The marine cables \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\ncan be distinguished by the materials used. Especially with regard to additional safety \n\nrequirements for offshore oil and gas operations, there are different technical solutions. \n\n3.5.5 Competitive Rivalry \n\nRivalry between companies can limit industry profitability depending on the intensity and \n\nthe form of competition (Porter, 2008a, p. 9). \n\nDue to the fact that specific information about rivalry in the related industry could not \n\nderived from secondary data, structured interviews have been conducted with the following \n\nmarine cable producers and suppliers operating on the Brazilian market: Cross Fox, Dova \n\nSupply, Nexans, Prysmian Group and Telefio Cabos. The detailed questions and answers can \n\nbe found in appendix 5. \n\nThe results of the interviews show that the overall market rivalry can be considered as \n\nmoderate to highly competitive. On the one hand, only a few producers and suppliers could be \n\nidentified. The major companies include Cofibam (Brazil), Eurocabos (Brazil), FNCE \n\n(Brazil), General Cable (Brazil) Nexans (France), Pan Electric (Brazil), Prysmian Group \n\n(Italy) and Wirex (Brazil). On the other hand, however, the market decline within the \n\nshipbuilding industry and the monopoly of Petrobras significantly intensify the market \n\ncompetition. \n\nThe sources of rivalry are mainly technology and price. Especially for activities in deep-\n\nwater areas, technology that is advanced in terms of safety properties and physical resilience \n\nis of great importance. (Okun, et al., 2003, pp. 3-13). The individual companies offer different \n\ntechnical solutions. In this connection Friesland Kabel distinguishes itself by providing state-\n\nof-the-art technology in combination with a comprehensive service performance (see chapter \n\n4). \n\nConcerning the price competition, it has to be considered that Friesland Kabel has a price \n\ndisadvantage compared to suppliers of locally manufactured products, since companies \n\npursuing an import based strategy are affected by additional import and transportation costs. \n\nFurthermore, it has been shown that local content requirements additionally increase the \n\nrivalry among foreign suppliers.  \n\n3.5.6 Five Forces Summary \n\nThe analysis has shown that the competitive environment of the related industry is shaped by \n\nonly a few forces. Among them, the suppliers\u2019 power and the threat of substitutes have the \n\nleast potential effects on Friesland Kabel\u00b4s business activities and even provide favorable \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nstarting conditions. However, other aspects, in particular the predominance of Petrobras and \n\nlocal content policies have a great impact on Friesland Kabel\u00b4s expansion plans and require \n\nwell-considered strategic responses. In order to provide a concise overview, the most \n\nimportant forces are presented and evaluated in table 10. \n\n \n\nTable 10: Overview of Porter`s Five Competitive Forces (Own Presentation, 2014) \n\nCompetitive Force Rating Most Relevant Impacts \n\nSupplier Power Low ?

In contrast to \n\nthe previous external analysis, this chapter has an internal focus on the strengths and \n\nweaknesses of Friesland Kabel. Only both perspectives seen together, external and internal \n\nprovide a full overview, which is necessary for selecting an appropriate strategy and business \n\nmodel for the company (Hill, et al., 2013, p. 82). \n\nThe investigation starts with a brief presentation of Friesland Kabel and the determination \n\nof the company\u00b4s tangible and intangible resources. In a second step, the competitive potential \n\nof the identified resources and capabilities will be assessed with the aid of the VRIO \n\nframework. \n\n4.1 Company Profile \n\nFounded in 2007, Friesland Kabel is a medium-size enterprise which currently employs \n\nworldwide 30 people. Headquartered near Hamburg (Germany), the company operates \n\nworldwide in on- and offshore projects and maintains subsidiary offices in Romania, Croatia, \n\nCzech Republic, Argentina and Brazil. Friesland Kabel is the exclusive distributor of the \n\nfinish cable producer Helkama in almost all European countries, Russia and South America. \n\nThe product portfolio includes marine- and industrial cables complying with the highest \n\nquality and safety requirements (Friesalnd Kabel, 2014).  \n\nFriesland Kabel possesses a variety of different capabilities. Based on the company\u2019s web \n\npresence the main tangible and intangible resources have been determined and complemented \n\nby the CEO of Friesland Kabel, Klaus Moorlampen.

Resources are the \n\ntangible and intangible assets of organizations. Resources allow companies to develop \n\ncapabilities which in turn are the basis for competitive advantage (Hitt, et al., 2009, p. 76). \n\nAccording to Barney, \n\n \u201ca firm is said to have a (sustainable) competitive advantage when it is implementing a \n\nvalue creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential \n\ncompetitors (and when these other firms are unable to duplicate the benefits of this \n\nstrategy)\u201d (Barney, 1991, p. 102). \n\n \n\nIn view of the strong competition Friesland Kabel faces in the Brazilian oil and gas sector, \n\nit is crucial to offer products and services that distinguish themselves from those of its \n\ncompetitors. \n\nAn appropriate method for assessing whether resources of organizations provide them with \n\nsustainable competitive advantage is provided by the VRIO model. The acronym VRIO \n\nstands for four characteristics which determine the competitive potential of resources (Barney, \n\n1991, pp. 105 - 106): \n\n \n\n1. Value:  Does the resource enable the company to exploit environmental opportunities, \n\nand/or neutralize threats? \n\n2. Rarity:  Is the resource exclusively possessed by only a small number of \n\norganizations?  \n\n3. Imitability:  Is the resource imperfectly imitable in order to avoid that other firms \n\ncannot obtain them? \n\n4. Organization:  Does the firm\u2019s organization enable the exploitation of its valuable, \n\nrare and imperfectly imitable resources? \n\n \n\nAccording to the VRIO approach, resources can only lead to sustainable competitive \n\nadvantage if you can answer all these questions with yes. The table below shows the \n\ncompetitive and economic implications, depending on which of the four criteria apply \n\n(Barney &amp; Hesterly, 2010, pp. 68-86). \n\n  \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nTable 12: VRIO Analysis: Competitive and Economic Implications (Adapted from Barney \n\n&amp; Hesterly, 2010) \n\nValuable?

The interviews were individual and carried \n\nout via telephone. The sample consists of three respondents who were selected because of \n\ntheir strategic knowledge: the CEO, the sales manager in Germany and the head of sales in \n\nLatin America. Based on the VRIO framework the interview included two main questions: \n\n \n\n1. Which are the main sources of Friesland Kabel`s competitive advantage and meet all \n\nthe following criteria?  \n\na) Valuable to the company\u00b4s goals. \n\nb) Rare in comparison to competitors. \n\nc) Difficult to imitate for competitors. \n\nd) Exploitable by the company. \n\n \n\n2. In which areas is Friesland Kabel not competitive and shows few or none of the \n\ncriteria above?  \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nFor both questions, the experts were asked during the interview to determine a maximum \n\nof five resources and to justify their responses. This was intended to ensure that only the real \n\ncore capabilities and disadvantages would be chosen.  \n\nGenerally, the interview participants replied to the questions very similarly. All three \n\nexperts specified the material properties of the marine cables as the key source of Friesland \n\nKabel\u00b4s competitive advantage. In this connection, especially the security features and the \n\nlight weight of the cables have been emphasized as unique properties compared to \n\ncompetitors. Moreover, the company\u00b4s customer services including the overall logistical \n\nconcept, fast production times and the capability to adapt the products to the customer\u00b4s needs \n\nwere also named among all respondents. Additionally, two of them mentioned the experience \n\nand reputation which Friesland Kabel has acquired in several international offshore projects.  \n\nThe disadvantages included mainly the limited financial resources and the lack of price \n\ncompetitiveness against local suppliers. Moreover, it can be added that Friesland Kabel does \n\nnot have long-standing knowledge about the Brazilian market. \n\nThe relevant aspects are presented once more in table 13. \n\n \n\nTable 13: Corporate Strengths and Weaknesses (Own Presentation, 2014) \n\nStrengths Weaknesses \n\n \n\n? Industry experience and \n\nreputation \n\n? Latest state-of-art products \n\n? Service: logistic, fast \n\nproduction time and on time, \n\ncustomization  \n\n \n\n \n\n? No price competitiveness \n\n? Few market knowledge \n\n? Limited financial resources \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n5 Strategy Formulation  \n\nSo far it has been analyzed which external and internal factors determine the scope of \n\nFriesland Kabel. On the basis of this analysis, the next major step is to select an appropriate \n\nset of strategic instruments through which the company is able to create and sustain \n\ncompetitive advantage.  \n\nAn appropriate strategy should therefore build on Friesland Kabel\u2019s capabilities and \n\ncompensate its weaknesses in order to take advantages of environmental opportunities and \n\novercome external barriers (Hill &amp; Jones, 2012, p. 7). Additionally, Porter considers the \n\nuniqueness of value proposition as the key success factor of a company\u00b4s strategy (Porter, \n\n1996, pp. 62-64).  \n\nAccording to Mintzberg, strategy is \u201ca pattern in a stream of decisions\u201d (Mintzberg, 1978, \n\np. 935). Core elements of strategic decisions include objectives, power, relationships, \n\nperformance, resources and competencies (Gupta, 2013, p. 86). Two levels of strategies can \n\nbe distinguished: (1) The corporate strategy and (2) the business strategy. On a business level, \n\ncompanies compete in a specific business area. In the case of this project, the business scope \n\nis determined by a specific industry and geographical area: the Brazilian oil and gas industry. \n\n A further distinction is to be made between global and national operations. Due to \n\ndifferentiated resource bases and more complex environments, MNEs in an international \n\nenvironment face a wider range of strategic choices compared to domestic companies. For \n\nthat reason global strategy formulation is generally more complicated and time-consuming \n\n(Tallman, 2009, p. 12).  \n\nThe literature provides several approaches to separating the individual components of \n\nmarket entry processes (Macharzina &amp; Wolf, 2005, p. 946) or (Perlitz, 2004, p. 64). Adapted \n\nfrom Hill, Jones &amp; Schilling, the strategy formulation of this project includes the following \n\nphases (Hill, et al., 2013, p. 11):  \n\n \n\n1. Mission, vision &amp; objectives  \n\n2. Strategic position \n\n3. Strategic actions \n\n4. Entry mode \n\n5. Marketing plan \n\n6. Action plan \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that the strategic framework developed here cannot be seen as the \n\nfinal solution. Strategic plans frequently have to be adapted in view of appearing or changing \n\nopportunities and risks. In this connection, Mintzberg coined the term \u201cemergent strategy\u201d \n\nwhich refers to strategic measures that were not intended from the beginning of the planning \n\nprocess or that were not realized due to unrealistic expectations, misjudgments, or inadequate \n\nimplementation approaches (Mintzberg, 1978, p. 945).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n6 Mission, Vision &amp; Objectives  \n\nBased on the assumption that the purpose of strategies is to ensure the achievement of \n\ncorporate goals, the question arises which objectives Friesland Kabel actually pursues. In \n\norder to explicitly express corporate goals, statements of mission, vision and objectives are \n\nuseful management tools. The correlation between these elements can be described as \n\nfollows: A strategic plan determines the use of resources and objectives to accomplish the \n\ncompany\u00b4s mission that in turn will lead to the achievement of the vision (Wallace, 2009, p. \n\n29).  \n\n6.1 Mission Statement \n\nThe Mission is the overall purpose of a company and the reason for its existence (Ahlstrom \n\n&amp; Bruton, 2010, p. 106). In the literature, the mission statement is often set as the first \n\ncomponent of the strategic management process, since it constitutes a guiding framework that \n\nserves as an orientation for all business activities. Further functions of mission statements \n\ninclude legitimation, information, motivation, and public relations (Baldegger, 2012, p. 145).  \n\nThere are no common rules regarding the content and elements of mission statements. \n\nGenerally, mission statements are structured in three parts: First, an introduction describes the \n\npurpose of the statement. The second part covers the company\u2019s activities, including its \n\nproducts and markets. The third part defines the relationship with internal and external \n\nstakeholders. (Baldegger, 2012, p. 146).  \n\nMission statements are effective if they present certain characteristics such as: relevant, \n\nclear, realistic and achievable, flexible, current, enduring and inspiring (Evans, et al., 2011, p. \n\n16) or (Olsen, et al., 2004, p. 13). \n\nMissions can not only be helpful for the entire company, but also for specific business \n\nunits. Especially for international business operations it is important to adapt the overall goals \n\nof the company to a host country level (Ahlstrom &amp; Bruton, 2010, p. 106). In this connection, \n\nthree fundamental dimensions can be distinguished: (1) customer groups (whom to satisfy?); \n\n(2) customer needs (what to satisfy?) and (3) key capabilities (how to satisfy?) (Hill &amp; Jones, \n\n2012, p. 15).  \n\n \n\nCustomer groups: Friesland Kabel\u00b4s potential operations in Brazil are concentrated on \n\nBusiness-to-Business (B2B) markets in which the supply and the demand side exclusively \n\nconsists of organizations (Wright, 2004, p. 3). The target organizations of Friesland Kabel can \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nbe further distinguished into two groups. The firs group is composed of the main oil and gas \n\nproducers already presented in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. These companies constitute the final customer. \n\nThe second group consists of some major suppliers of oil and gas production, including \n\nprivate shipyards, shipbuilding or platform manufacturers and marine engineering companies. \n\n \n\nCustomer needs: Both types of customers need high complexity services and equipment. \n\nWhich supplier requirements are actually demanded can be derived from Petrobras\u2019 \n\nqualification and register process regulations. According to these, suppliers must meet \n\ntechnical, economical, legal and classificatory criteria. \n\nTechnical requirements refer to the capacity of the company and the products of the firm. \n\nThe economic stability is also important with regard to ensuring a reliable and continuous \n\nsupply of products. Legal aspects include regulatory registration and a local representation in \n\nBrazil. Classificatory requirements cover health, safety, environmental and managerial \n\nstandards (Petrobras, 2014b). \n\n \n\nKey Capabilities: The key capabilities of Friesland Kabel have already been determined in \n\nchapter 4. Due to the highly competitive environment of the industry (see chapter 3.5) \n\ncompetitive competences are of particular importance.  \n\n \n\nBased on these principles, a preliminary business mission statement for Friesland Kabel\u00b4s \n\nexpansion to the Brazilian oil and gas market has been drafted: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2 Vision Statement \n\nLike a mission statement, visions are fundamental for the strategic development of \n\norganizations or individual business units. However, visions are broader. They constitute the \n\ncontext in which missions are embedded and formulated. Visions are also more future- \n\noriented and enduring, while missions are subjected to changing environmental conditions.  \n\nFriesland Kabel provides the major producers and suppliers in the Brazilian oil and gas \n\nindustry with reliable and on time supply of safe, high quality and state of art products. By \n\nconstantly adapting these capabilities to changing requirements we are striving to add value \n\nto our customers operations. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nA vision can be defined as \u201ca picture of what the firm wants to be and, in broad terms, \n\nwhat it wants to ultimately achieve\u201d (Hitt, et al., 2007, p. 19). Thus, the vision sets the \n\ndirection of the company or the intended corporate development. Three different functions of \n\nvison statements can be distinguished (Hungenberg, 2012, p. 26):  \n\n \n\n? Identity: The vision should give the enterprise a unique and distinctive identity. \n\n? Identification: The vision should demonstrate to the members of an enterprise a deeper \n\nmeaning and use of their work and thereby facilitate their identification with the \n\norganization. \n\n? Mobilization: The vision should encourage the members of the enterprise to achieve \n\nthe intended goals.  \n\n \n\n Moreover, vision statements must meet certain criteria including: concisely and clear, \n\nsimple and short, unique and distinctive, suitable to the company, show the social and moral \n\nresponsibility of the company and be credible for the stakeholders (Siller &amp; Grausam, 2013, p. \n\n204) and (Hitt, et al., 2007, p. 19). \n\nThe development of a vision is a creative and intuitive process. According to Collins and \n\nPorras, vision statements consist of two major components: Core ideology and envisioned \n\nfuture. The core ideology describes what a company stands for and why it exists. This aspect \n\nincludes the core values and the core purpose of a firm. The term \u201cenvisioned future\u201d refers to \n\nthe goals of the company in a 10 to 30 years\u2019 time horizon and the description of what it will \n\nbe like to achieve these goal. (Collins &amp; Porras, 1996, pp. 65-67). By means of this approach, \n\na provisional vision statement for Friesland Kabel has been elaborated: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThrough innovation, high quality and reliability the purpose of Friesland Kabel is to help \n\noil and gas producers work more efficiently and to take part in the Brazilian offshore oil \n\nand gas exploration. Therefore, in the next 10 years Friesland Kabel will strive to become \n\nthe premier contracted and most recognized supplier for marine cables, wires and network \n\ntechnology in the Brazilian oil and gas industry.  \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\n6.3 Objectives \n\nObjectives are short term to long term goals that an organization pursues in order to \n\naccomplish its corporate or business unit mission. The main purpose of setting objectives is \n\ntranslating an organization\u2019s mission and vision into precise and detailed performance targets. \n\nFurther functions include legitimacy, orientation, evaluation, coordination and motivation \n\n(Rao, et al., 2008, p. 88). \n\nA framework that helps in order to express strategic objectives is the SMART model, \n\nwhich describes the five most relevant criteria of corporate objectives: Specific, measurable, \n\nattainable, relevant, and time-relevant (Doran, et al., 1981, pp. 35-36). The table below \n\nexplains the individual elements more precisely: \n\n \n\nTable 14: SMART MODEL (Doran, Miller, &amp; Cunningham, 1981) \n\nS The objective should specifically define what is to be achieved and what requirements \n\nare necessary for this. \n\nM An objective should be measurable through quantified or qualified indicators in order \n\nto evaluate its achievement. \n\nA The company\u00b4s objective should be attainable through its capabilities and resources. \n\nR The objective should be relevant to the key result areas and the overall success of the \n\ncompany. \n\nT Effective objectives should be set in a time-frame including a deadline until when the \n\ngoals have to be achieved. \n\n \n\nFor Friesland Kabel\u00b4s market entry in the Brazilian oil and gas industry the key result areas \n\nof business activity, in which the firm will have to excel in order to beat competition and \n\nfulfill customer requirements, have been determined (Harvard Business Review, 2009, p. 37). \n\nThen, based on the SMART criteria, these areas have been converted into the following \n\nobjectives: \n\n \n\n? Market standing: To steadily gain market share and volume until becoming the market \n\nleader for marine cable after 10 years of market presence. \n\n? Customer relationship: To become a main supplier for marine cables of Petrobras. \n\nCreate incentives which increase the costs for Petrobras to switch to other supplier. \n\n? Product innovation: To adapt the products steadily according to the customers\u2019 needs \n\nand requirements. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n? Customer service: Offering an overall exclusive service that meets all of the \n\ncustomer\u00b4s requirements including logistical support and pre-sale service. \n\n? Distribution and marketing: Intensifying and extending distribution. Creating new \n\nmarketing channels and brand recognition. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n7 Strategic Position: SWOT Analysis \n\nOne core element of strategic development is the assessment of an organization\u2019s strategic \n\nposition. An established framework for this purpose is the SWOT analysis. Consistent with \n\nFriesland Kabel\u00b4s mission, the SWOT framework helps to analyze whether the current \n\nsituation of the company is appropriate in order to react to environmental influences. Thus, \n\nthe overall aim of this approach is to provide a basis for deriving strategies that exploit an \n\norganization\u00b4s opportunities and strengths, while neutralizing threats it faces and avoiding its \n\nweaknesses (Griffin &amp; Fleet, 2014, p. 157). \n\nFor the present SWOT analysis, the three to five most relevant external and internal factors \n\nfrom chapter 2, 3 and 4, have been determined with regard to potential business impacts. The \n\nresults are presented in the matrix below: \n\n \n\nTable 15: SWOT Analysis Matrix (Own presentation, 2014) \n\nINTERNAL \n\nStrengths \n\n \n\n? Industry experience and reputation \n\n?

In some cases it is necessary to develop new ways in order to accomplish \n\npositive outcomes, while in others, it is possible to complement individual SWOT elements in \n\norder to create mutual gain. With regard to the second option, three cases are possible \n\n(Andersen, 2013, pp. 64-66): \n\n \n\n? Using strengths to leverage opportunities \n\n? Take advantage of opportunities in order to overcome weaknesses \n\n? Using strengths to avoid or reduce threats \n\n8.1 Corporate Compliance \n\nCorporate Compliance \u201crelies primarily on controlling employees\u2019 behaviors and decisions \n\nthrough a strict set of rules and laws\u201d (Cremer &amp; Lemmich, 2015). As mentioned before, \n\nrecent corruption scandals have had significant impacts on the Brazilian oil and gas industry. \n\nIn this context, it is important to understand that the companies involved are the victims of \n\nthis situation. Especially for German companies, which have a good reputation in terms of \n\ncompliance, this offers new opportunities. For that reason, Friesland Kabel should implement \n\nanticorruption programs and ethical guidelines in its corporate strategy in order to signal to its \n\ncustomers that the company is a fair and reliable business partner.  \n\n8.2 Value Based Marketing  \n\nConcerning product prices, Friesland Kabel cannot compete with local Brazilian producers. \n\nThus, Friesland Kabel has to pursue a marketing strategy which emphasizes the company\u00b4s \n\ncapabilities such as product quality, customer service, innovation and industry experience \n\n(Ferrell &amp; Hartline, 2011). A more detailed marketing plan is described in chapter 10. \n\n8.3 Staged Market Expansion \n\nInternalization in new unknown markets is often a sequential process whereby companies \n\ngradually acquire market knowledge and capabilities. Especially for small and medium sized \n\nenterprises (SMEs) with limited financial resources, a staged market expansion represents a \n\ngood approach (Johnson, et al., 2008, p. 311). This also applies to Friesland Kabel. The \n\ncompany must initially consider entry modes that allow the firm to accumulate knowledge \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nwhile minimizing the risks. Once Friesland Kabel has acquired sufficient cash flow and \n\nmarket experience, the company can then gradually increase its commitment. \n\n8.4 Strategic Partnerships \n\nLocal content requirements are the most impactful business restrictions for Friesland \n\nKabel. Moderate technological complexity and differentiation of Friesland Kabel\u00b4s product \n\nsegment offer companies such as Petrobras few incentives for contracting a foreign marine \n\ncable supplier (Petrobras, 2014c).  \n\nAn effective solution to this might be strategic cooperation. Through alliances with local \n\npartners Friesland Kabel can overcome local content barriers and exploit its competitive \n\nadvantage over local suppliers. A more detailed analysis of strategic partnerships is provided \n\nin chapter 10.  \n\n8.5 Industry Specialists \n\nThe term \u201cCusto Brasil\u201d summarizes different environmental factors identified in chapter 2 \n\nincluding bureaucracy, corruption or infrastructure. A valuable solution for the company to \n\nprepare itself for these types of business restrictions is obtaining professional support from \n\nmarket experts. \n\nOne option is to hire private experts such as local businessmen, lawyers and consultancies \n\nwhich are more familiar with the Brazilian market. A more cost-efficient alternative is \n\nrequesting the support of governmental institutions such as embassies, industry associations, \n\nconsulates or chambers of commerce.  \n\nOn the German side, these include especially the chamber of commerce (AHK) in Rio de \n\nJaneiro, which among other sectors is specialized in the oil and gas industry. The AHK \n\nprovides German companies with comprehensive services ranging from general market \n\ninformation to individual entry strategies (AHK, 2014a). \n\nThe Brazilian counterpart is the agency Apex-Brasil. By working closely together with \n\nPetrobras, ONIP, and other local trade associations, Apex-Brasil aims to facilitate the market \n\nentry of foreign investors though providing business information, network building, \n\nopportunity identification and support in site selection (Apex-Brasil, 2014b).  \n\nAnother helpful institution is the Federation of the Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro \n\n(FIRJAN). Besides other performance areas, the FIRJAN is specialized in the oil and gas \n\nindustry and through its international business center (Centro Internacional de Neg\u00f3cios - \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nCIN) supports the market entry of national and foreign firms into the oil and gas supply chain \n\n(FIRJAN, 2015a). \n\n8.6 Customer Acquisition and Retention \n\nDue to Petrobras\u2019 privileged market position it is almost impossible to avoid this potential \n\ncustomer. For this reason, everything will revolve around the question how Friesland Kabel \n\nwill manage to be selected by Petrobras.  \n\nOne option is to directly apply through the supplier registration system \u201cPetronect\u201d. For \n\nthis purpose, it is essential to know how Friesland Kabel can present itself in the best way \n\nduring this procedure. A guide about the registration process, requirements and key success \n\nfactors for applicants is provided in the following (Petrobras, 2014c).  \n\nPetrobras\u2019 online registration system regulates the procurement process for contracting \n\nsuppliers of goods and services. With the grant of CRCC, registered companies obtain access \n\nto different procurement parties, market demands and bidding rounds. The registration is valid \n\nfor up to one year and has to be annually renewed by updating legal and economic documents. \n\nThe initial registrations process starts with the login on the online portal Petronect \n\n(.https://www.petronect.com.br/). At this stage, the firm has to provide information including \n\nthe scope of goods and services, contact information, and local representation.  \n\nAfter successful completion of the \u201cidentification\u201d phase, the company will be evaluated in \n\nthe \u201cquestionnaire\u201d phase. The scope of evaluation depends on the type of supplier. Friesland \n\nKabel falls into the category \u201cTrade Manufacturer\u201d which is a \u201csupplier that produces \n\nequipment, materials or inputs and trades them directly with Petrobras.\u201d In this case, the \n\nevaluation is based on technical, legal, economic, managerial, health, safety and environment \n\ncriteria. The most relevant aspects to each criterion for the supply of products are summarized \n\nin the following: \n\nLegal requirements \n\n? Evidence that the company is regularly registered in the country of origin \n\n? The company must have a legal representative in Brazil in form of a person or entity \n\nempowered to receive summons and to respond administratively and judicially. \n\nAdditional commercial representation is not mandatory but advisable for foreign \n\ncompanies. \n\n? Evidence that the company is not bankrupt or indebted. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n?

However, required on-site inspections can significantly extend this \n\nperiod.   \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Petronect Supplier Registration (Own Presentation, 2014) \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nLOGIN \n\n \n\u2022 www. petronect.com.br \n\nINDETIFICATION \n\n\u2022 - Contact Information \n\n\u2022 - Product Information \n\n\u2022 - Local Representative \n\nEVALUATION \n\n \n\n\u2022 Technical \n\n\u2022 Legal \n\n\u2022 Economical  \n\n\u2022 Managerial \n\n\u2022  Health, Safety &amp; Environment  \n\nADDITIONAL \nREQUIREMENTS \n\n\u2022 On-Site Inspection \n\n\u2022 Documental Complementation \n\nAPPROVAL \n\n\u2022 System Registration \n\n\u2022 Obtaining Certification \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nAn alternative to applying for the registration system is to supply to a smaller producer, \n\nwhich in turn sell its products to Petrobras. Thus, Friesland Kabel would be able to narrow the \n\noptions of Petrobras. The purpose of supplying initially to smaller companies in the industry \n\nis for Friesland Kabel to \u201cget a foot in the door\u201d and establish itself step by step.  \n\nOnce having entered a contractual agreement with Petrobras, it has to find ways to create \n\nincentives for gradually establishing a long term relationship and \u201cclose the door\u201d for other \n\nmarket entrants (Bryce &amp; Dyer, 2007, p. 92). To this aim, Friesland Kabel should try to \n\ngenerate network effects and create brand recognition based on their sources of competitive \n\nadvantage. \n\n8.7 Product Segmentation \n\nAs already mentioned, marine cables and network technology are the two product types of \n\nFriesland Kabel which best fit the related industry. In particular, cables for fixed installations \n\nin offshore vessels show the highest potential in terms of demand. For that reason, Friesland \n\nKabel should focus on products which meet the particular requirements of the oil and gas \n\nproduction. These characteristics include mainly resistance against flames, fire, heat, smoke \n\nand oil. In the following the products which fulfill all these needs are listed and briefly \n\ndescribed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nTable 16: Product Segmentation (Own Presentation, 2015) \n\nProduct Name Description \n\nLKSM-EMC-FRHF  \n\n \n\nFire-resistant armored power control cable \n\nwith improved EMC screening 0,6/1kV \n\nLKM-FRHF Fire-resistant unarmored power and control \n\ncable 0,6/1kV \n\nLKSM-FRHF Fire-resistant armored power and control \n\ncable 0,6/1kV \n\nLKAM-FRHF Fire-resistant armored power and control \n\ncable 0,6/1kV \n\nLKM-FRHF Fire-resistant unarmored control and \n\ninstrumentation cable 250V \n\nLKSM-FRHF Fire-resistant unarmored control and \n\ninstrumentation cable 250V \n\nLKAM-FRHF Fire-resistant screened control and \n\ninstrumentation cable 250V \n\nRFE-FRHF Fire-resistant armored instrumentation and \n\ncommunication cable 250V \n\nRFE-FRHF (i) Fire-resistant armored and pair screened \n\ninstrumentation and communication cable \n\n250V \n\nRFA-FRHF Fire-resistant screened instrumentation and \n\ncommunication cable 250V \n\nRFA-FRHF (i) Fire-resistant collectively and pair screened \n\ninstrumentation and communication cable \n\n250V \n\n \n\n8.8 Warehousing \n\nThe oil and gas industry requires a quick supply according to the exact material needs of its \n\ncustomers. For that reason, it is advisable for Friesland Kabel to place a local warehouse in \n\nBrazil. In this warehouse, the finished products will be stored and delivered directly from \n\nthere to the customer. This logistical approach enables Friesland Kabel to maintain a source of \n\nsupply, react to demand and exploit its fast production time by overcoming time and distance \n\nrestrictions (Voortman, 2004, p. 55).  \n\nRelevant aspects regarding the warehouse design are related to ownership and location. In \n\nview of financial constraints, Friesland Kabel should lease stock facilities and optionally share \n\nthem with partners. Except for the cost advantage, a jointly owned warehouse offers Friesland \n\nKabel further benefits including contractual adaption to the firm\u00b4s requirements, risk \n\nminimizing and flexibility with regard of prospective changes (Voortman, 2004, p. 58).  \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nFor the strategic site selection of the warehouse, the most relevant criteria have been \n\ndetermined and rated based on their impact on costs and supply time.  \n\n \n\nTable 17: Criteria for  Strategic Sitting (Own Presentation, 2015) \n\nCriteria Rate \n\nDistance to Relevant Offshore Fields 10 \n\nDistance to Customer (Petrobras) 10 \n\nCosts of Basic Infrastructure  10 \n\nAccess for Employees 10 \n\nLeasing Rate 1 \n\nScale: Excellent=10; Very good=6; Good=4; Reasonable=2; Weak=1 \n\n \n\nBetween the five states (Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina \n\nand S\u00e3o Paulo) that have been taken into consideration, Rio de Janeiro, as the center of the \n\nnational oil and shipbuilding industry, represents by far the best location, despite having the \n\nhighest renting costs in the country (FipeZap, 2015, p. 2). 60% of the national gas reserves \n\nand more than 80% of the oil reserves are concentrated in Rio de Janeiro. Moreover, 18 \n\nshipyards, more than 60 production platforms, 8 oil and gas terminals, 5 logistic bases \n\n(FIRJAN, 2015b), and different R&amp;D centers are located in the state.  \n\nWithin the state of Rio de Janeiro, the city Niteroi has been further identified as one of the \n\nmost suitable sites. Niteroi is the principal center of the country\u00b4s shipbuilding industry \n\nhaving the highest concentration of shipyards (see figure 8), of which the majority produces \n\nproduction units and offshore vessels for Petrobras. Only the 5 biggest shipyards located in \n\nthe city, Alian\u00e7a, Mau\u00e1, Vard, Brasa e Renave, comprise about 10.000 employees. \n\nFurthermore, 13 out of 50 associated companies of Sinaval and other major players of the \n\nindustry including Enaval, Naproservice, UTC Engenhaira, Equipemar and Dockshore are \n\nlocated in the city (SINAVAL, 2014). \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Shipyards in Niteroi (Google Maps, 2015) \n\n \n\n \n\n8.9 Research &amp; Development \n\nThe Pre-Salt oil and gas exploration presents new challenges to technology. For that \n\nreason, Friesland Kabel should invest in research and development in order to constantly \n\nadapt its products and services to newly emerging customer requirements.  \n\nThis can be done through cooperation with local research centers. One of the leading \n\nresearch institutions in Brazil within the field of oil and gas technology is the American \n\nmultinational conglomerate General Electric (GE). The Oil &amp; Gas business unit in Brazil \n\nemploys more than 2.000 people between 6 different locations within the states S\u00e3o Paulo and \n\nRio de Janeiro. Among other areas, the GE Oil &amp; Gas is also specialized in technologies for \n\nthe oil and gas offshore processing and subsea exploration (General Electric, 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\n8.10 Strategic Activities at a Glance \n\nThe table above summarizes the proposed strategic activities according to its \n\nenvironmental and internal starting conditions. \n\n \n\nTable 18: Summary Strategic Activities (Own Presentation, 2015) \n\nStrategy Starting condition \n\nCompliance                            Corruption \n\nValue Based Marketing          \n\nExperience and reputation \n\nState of the art products \n\nNo price competitiveness \n\nLocal Research Center           Technological challenges \n\nExpertise                              \nLittle market knowledge \n\n\u201cCusto Brasil\u201d \n\nLocal Stock                            \nDemand for marine equipment \n\nFast production time \n\nSegmentation                         Market volume of the E&amp;P segment \n\nStrategic Partnerships            Local content policies \n\nCustomer Acquisition             Monopoly of Petrobras \n\nStaged Market Expansion       Limited financial resources \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\n9 Market Entry Mode \n\nThe choice of the entry mode is one of the central strategic decisions (\u201cfrontier issue\u201d) for \n\na company\u00b4s international expansion (Wind &amp; Perlmutter, 1977). An international market \n\nentry mode is \u201can institutional arrangement that makes possible the entry of a company\u2019s \n\nproducts, technology, human skills, management, or other resources into a foreign country\u201d \n\n(Root, 1994, p. 41). Thus, the entry mode defines the framework of company\u00b4s international \n\nvalue-added activities and influences its future corporate governance. In this connection, it is \n\nimportant to note that the choice of foreign market entry mode often constitutes a sequential \n\nprocess in which companies depending on the course of internationalization gradually \n\nincrease their commitment (Chang &amp; Rosenzweig, 2001, pp. 750-751). \n\n9.1 Types and Systematization \n\nThere are several types of international market entry modes. Buckley &amp; Casson determine \n\na set of 12 market entry strategies which in turn are subdivided into alternative variants \n\n(Buckley &amp; Casson, 1998, pp. 547-549). The main entry mode types are: export, licensing, \n\nfranchising, international joint ventures (IJVs) alliances and Greenfield investments (Johnson, \n\net al., 2008, p. 31).   \n\nEntry modes differ basically in the local focus on company\u00b4s business operations. Thus, \n\norganizations can either emphasize domestic value addition or focus on the host country. This \n\ndistinction criterion is directly linked to the organizational trade-off between a risk or control \n\nbased management approach (Root, 1994). Based on this dichotomy, three main types of \n\nentry modes can be distinguished (Zentes, 2012, p. 26):  \n\n \n\n? Investment entry modes: The establishing of wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries can \n\nbe realized in form of \u201cGreenfield Investment\u201d (new physical facilities) or through \n\nacquisitions of established local firms. Both types are considered the most host \n\ncountry based approaches which gives organizations effective control but involves \n\nhigh risks especially regarding the invested capital.  \n\n \n\n? Cooperative entry modes: This type of foreign market entry mode includes mainly \n\ncontractual arrangements such as licensing, franchising, joint ventures or alliances. In \n\ncomparison to investment entry modes, cooperative forms of institutionalization are \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nless risky, since a transfer of capital doesn\u2019t happen or is only marginal. However, the \n\nlevel of control is limited due to coordination costs with contractual partners.  \n\n \n\n? Export entry modes: Export through direct sale forces, agents, representatives or \n\ndistributors constitute the most traditional entry mode on an exclusively market- \n\ndriven basis. Exporting goods or services abroad requires the lowest resource \n\ncommitment of organizations while the degree of control is very limited.  \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Systematization of Entry Modes (Adapted from Zentes 2012) \n\n \n\n \n\n          RISK \n\n      Control \n\n \n\n9.2 Entry Mode Decision \n\nThe choice of foreign market entry mode involves the consideration of different \n\ninterrelated variables and dimensions including location costs, financial variables, cultural \n\nfactors, market structure and adaption costs (Buckley &amp; Casson, 1998, p. 543). Basically, it is \n\npossible to distinguish between external factors of the host country, external factors of the \n\nhome country and internal factors (Davis, et al., 2000, p. 239) or (Root, 1994). \n\n For the market entry of Friesland Kabel, the analysis follows a two-step approach. First, \n\nbased on Root\u00b4s decision matrix, the most relevant external and internal variables for \n\nFriesland Kabel will be selected. Then, these selected criteria will be used to evaluate the \n\npreviously identified types of entry mode. This makes it possible to draw conclusions about \n\nENTRY \nMODES \n\nEXPORT \nENTRY \nMODES \n\nEXPORT \n\nCOOPERATIVE \nENTRY \nMODES \n\nLICENSING &amp; \nFRANCHISING \n\nIJV`s &amp; \nAlliances \n\nINVESTMENT \nENTRY \nMODES \n\nAQUISITONS GREEN FILED \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nwhich entry mode best fits to preferences of Friesland Kabel. After this initial assignment, it \n\nwill be analyzed which alternative variants of the selected entry mode exist and determined \n\nwhich is the most suitable with regard to Friesland Kabel\u00b4s strategic situation.  \n\n9.3 Framework Application: Market Entry Decision Matrix \n\nBased on the most relevant external and internal conditions of Friesland Kabel, the \n\ndimensions and variables in the left columns of table 19 have been selected. Every entry mode \n\nreceived an individual rating from 0 to 3 points for each criterion. Additionally, the variables \n\nhave been roughly ranked according to their importance for Friesland Kabel from top to \n\nbottom whereby the most significant factors are located in the upper half. \n\n \n\nTable 19: Market Entry Decision Matrix (Adapted from Root, 1994) \n\n \n\nDIMESNION \n\n \n\nVARIABLE \n\nENTRY MODE \n\n \n\nExport \n\nLicensing/ \n\nFranchising \n\nIJV\u00b4s \n\nAlliance\n\ns \n\n \n\nAcquisitions \n\n \n\nGreenfield \n\nHOST \n\nCOUNTRY \n\nPOLICY \n\nRestrictive \n\nImport Policies \n  \n\n? \n\n \n\n?? \n\n \n\n??? \n\n \n\n??? \n\nRestrictive \n\nInvestment \n\nPolicies \n\n \n\n??? \n\n \n\n??? \n\n \n\n?? \n\n  \n\nRISK Low ??? ?? ?? ? ? \n\nSTRATEGY Long-term \n\nInvestment \n ? ?? ??? ??? \n\n \n\n \n\nRESOURCES \n\nLimited \n\nFinancial \n\nResources \n\n \n\n??? \n\n \n\n??? \n\n \n\n?? \n\n  \n\nInternational \n\nExpertise \n  ??? ??? ??? \n\nCULTURE Significant \n\nDifferences  \n \n\n? \n\n \n\n?? \n\n \n\n??? \n\n \n\n? \n\n \n\n? \n\nCOMPETITI\n\nON \n\nMonopsony   ??? ?? ?? \n\nGEOGRAPHY Long distance \n\nbetween \n\nMarkets \n\n   \n\n?? \n\n \n\n?? \n\n \n\n?? \n\nTOTAL  10 12 21 15 15 \n\n?     = Moderate conditions for entry-mode strategy  \n\n??   = Favorable conditions for entry-mode strategy \n\n??? = Perfect conditions for entry-mode strategy \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\n9.4 Strategic Cooperation \n\nIJVs and strategic Alliances are the most appropriate entry modes for Friesland Kabel. In \n\nthe presented framework they obtained the highest number of points in total and show the best \n\nresults with respect to the most important aspects. Strategic partnerships provide Friesland \n\nKabel with favorable conditions regarding restrictive host country barriers and the \n\ncompetitive structure of the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, such a strategy is feasible in \n\nview of Friesland Kabel\u00b4s financial resources and matches the company\u00b4s long-term \n\norientation on the Brazilian market. In summary, the main objectives of Friesland Kabel to go \n\nfor a strategic cooperation are:  \n\n \n\n? Accelerated access to the market  \n\n? Overcoming business constraints (local content requirements) \n\n? Risk minimization (compared to investment modes) \n\n? Market knowledge of local partner \n\n? Collaboration with competitors \n\n \n\nIn contrast, investment entry modes would exceed the financial means and thus imply too \n\nmuch risk for the firm.  \n\nStrategies on an exclusively sales-driven basis constitute an alternative for an initial market \n\npenetration. However, they do not offer a solution concerning the increasing local content \n\nrequirements and the supremacy of Petrobras.  \n\n9.5 Joint Ventures vs. Strategic Alliances \n\nJVs and strategic alliances are alternative types of cooperative strategies. Basically, the \n\ndifference between both forms is that JVs involve the creation of a third-party legal entity, \n\nwhereas strategic alliances do not necessarily require equity sharing. For that reason, strategic \n\nalliances require less investment capital, provide more exit options and show less involvement \n\nbetween the partners (Walters, et al., 1994, p. 5).  \n\nDespite these differences, the two terms will be used synonymously in the following \n\nanalysis since such a determination requires more detailed information about the specific \n\npartners. Besides, the study focuses on the strategic settings of partnerships rather than on \n\ngeneric categories. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\n9.6 Joint Venture Formation \n\nAfter deciding to engage in a cooperative strategy the next questions deal with finding the \n\nappropriate design and the right business partner.  \n\n9.6.1 Joint Venture Design \n\nFirst, it will be analyzed how a potential JV between Friesland Kabel and a Brazilian firm \n\nmay be broadly designed regarding the location and the ownership of production and \n\ndistribution. Buckley &amp; Casson distinguish in their international entry mode model five types \n\nof JV based market entry strategies (Buckley &amp; Casson, 1998, p. 548): \n\n \n\n? JV in production: Partner firms share the production whereas distribution is separated. \n\n? JV in distribution: Partner firms share distribution whereas the production is separated. \n\n? JV exporting: The foreign partner exports to a joint distribution facility in the host \n\ncountry. \n\n? FDI/JV: The foreign partner alone owns the production whereas the distribution is \n\nshared. \n\n? JV/FDI: The foreign partner alone owns the distribution whereas the production is \n\nshared. \n\n \n\nBetween these alternatives, in the first entry phase only the JV exporting option can be \n\nconsidered, since Friesland Kabel obtains the market relevant products already completed \n\nfrom its one single supplier. Thus, Friesland Kabel pursues a mutual distribution partnership \n\nwhich provides the company with different sorts of advantages including risk sharing, market \n\nknowledge of the local partner and product diversification. \n\n9.6.2 Partner Selection \n\nThe success of JVs is crucially dependent on the right partner (Glaister &amp; Buckley, 1999, \n\npp. 136-138). According to Geringer, the partner selection \u201ccan influence the overall mix of \n\navailable skills and resources, the operating policies and procedures and short- and long term \n\nviability of an IJV\u201d (Geringer, 1991).  \n\n9.6.3 Partner Classification \n\nThe potential partner for Friesland Kabel can be categorized according to their size and \n\nproduct segment. Three different partner types have been considered as possible options. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nFriesland Kabel should use all three strategies alternatively, with option A as a priority, \n\nfollowed by B and C. \n\n \n\nBig scale MNC: The first choice for Friesland Kabel`s partner is the market leader \n\nPetrobras. This option refers to a non-equity contract where Friesland Kabel directly exports \n\nits products to Petrobras after having been selected through the application process and \n\nentered into a contractual agreement.  \n\nThis asymmetric type of partnership is mainly based on the task-related dimension. Big \n\nscales MNs typically provide greater \u2018staying power\u2019 and a greater volume of resources \n\n(Williams &amp; Lilley, 1993, p. 234). For entering the market it constitutes the less risky option \n\nwith the highest likelihood of returns of investment. However, the level of control for \n\nFriesland Kabel is very low in view of such a big partner. Therefore, it is crucial for the \n\ncompany to develop, in the curse of time, further incentives for maintaining a long-term \n\ncooperation. \n\n \n\nMiddle scale producers: With regard to Friesland Kabel\u00b4s target segments middle scale \n\ncompanies are platform manufacturer and a vessel producer. Here, the contractual framework \n\nagain constitutes a non-equity alliance with an import based strategy.  \n\n \n\nExample 1: MODEC \n\nFounded in 1968 and headquartered in Tokyo, MODEC is a multinational contractor \n\nspecialized in engineering, procurement, construction and installation of floating production \n\nstorage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessels and \n\ntension leg platforms (TLPs). In Brazil the company produces FSPOs in the shipyard Brasfels \n\nlocated in the state of Rio de Janeiro (MODEC, 2015). \n\n  \n\nExample 2: BW Offshore \n\nHeadquartered in Singapore and Oslo, BW Offshore is a global operator of FPSO. In more \n\nthan 30 years of experience, the company has executed 38 FPSO and FSO projects. In Brazil \n\nBW Offshore has offices in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paul and Vit\u00f3ria and already launched joint \n\nprojects with the shipyard Quip in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (BW Offshore, 2015). \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nSmall scale producers: The third option is to cooperate with another smaller equipment \n\nproducer. JVs of similar size companies generally are more compatible regarding the \n\noperational environment and corporate culture (Williams &amp; Lilley, 1993, p. 234). However, to \n\nguarantee successful cooperation the partner-related criteria are more important in comparison \n\nto the previous cases.  \n\nFurthermore, the product relatedness is an essential factor since it determines to what \n\nextent Friesland Kabel can share the partner\u00b4s distribution channels, brand and product image, \n\nindustrial knowledge and facilities for potential prospective production relocation (Yan &amp; \n\nLuo, 2001, p. 24) and (Geringer, et al., 1989). For that reason the product fit constitutes the \n\nmost fundamental criterion for this option. \n\n \n\nExample 1: Dova Supply \n\nFounded in 1964, Dova Supply is a Brazilian supplier for electronic equipment with a \n\nfocus on power cables, cables for application in the construction sector and marine cables for \n\nthe oil and gas industry. The company has a local warehouse in Rio de Janeiro with a total \n\narea of 2.000m\u00b2. In collaboration with the major distribution partner cofibam and Wirex the \n\ncompany already supplies its products to Petrobras. In the view of further expansion, Dova \n\nSupply is searching for acquisitions with other national or foreign cable suppliers (Dova \n\nSupply, 2015).  \n\n \n\nExample 2: HUMMEL \n\nFounded in 1948, Hummel AG is a German multinational company specialized in \n\nconnection systems. In Brazil, the company operates through its subsidiary Hummel \n\nConnector Systems Ltda., based in Tatui, S\u00e3o Paulo, since 2004. The company\u2019s products \n\ninclude cable glands, cable protection systems and plug-in connectors. These products are \n\nalso certified according to several national and international approvals (Brasil Offshore, \n\n2015). \n\n9.6.4 Partner Selection Criteria \n\nThe specific partner selection has to be carried out based on appropriate criteria. Basically, \n\ntwo dimensions of partner complementarity can be distinguished. Task-related criteria include \n\ntangible and intangible resources which organizations require in order to achieve their \n\ncorporate goals. Partner-related criteria refer to aspects which influence the efficiency and \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\neffectiveness of partnerships (Geringer, 1989, p. 569). Based on this dichotomy, several \n\ndimensions can be subdivided (Glaister, et al., 2004, pp. 38-46) or (Yan &amp; Luo, 2001).  \n\nFor the prospective partner identification of Friesland Kabel, the most relevant selection \n\ncriteria with regard to the firm\u2019s strategic goals have been determined and evaluated. In this \n\nconnection, it must be emphasized that only aspects for initial partner identification were \n\nconsidered. A more detailed examination of compatibility requires contractual negotiations \n\n(Williams &amp; Lilley, 1993, p. 234).  \n\n \n\nTable 20: Partner Selection Criteria (Own Presentation, 2015) \n\nRANK TASK-RELATED CRITERIA VARIABLE \n\n1 Market/Industry knowledge  Time on the market \n\n2 Country knowledge Local vs. International \n\n3 Market power Size &amp; Number of customer \n\n4 Financial resources Financial statements \n\n5 Product fit Quality and relatedness \n\n6 Technological resources R&amp;D  \n\nRANK PARTNER-RELATED CRITERIA VARIABLE \n\n1 Strategic fit Mission/Vision \n\n2 Reputation Size &amp; Number of customers \n\n4 Organizational Management capacities \n\n5 Cultural fit Previous international alliance experience \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n10 Marketing Plan: The SAVE Framework \n\nAfter having selected potential partners, the question arises how Friesland Kabel can \n\nconvince them to collaborate. This is a matter of marketing. In the international entry strategy \n\nprocess, the development of a marketing plan is one of the basic elements (Root, 1994, p. 4).  \n\nFor developing a marketing strategy, one has to take into consideration that Friesland \n\nKabel targets business markets (B2B) rather than consumer markets (B2C). Particularities of \n\nB2B markets include the complexity of products and services, the nature and diversity of \n\nindustrial demand, a lower number of customers, a larger volume of customers and a closer \n\nlong-term supplier-customer-relationship (Kotler, et al., 2006, p. 21). However, the core \n\ndifference is related to differentiation of products and services. In B2C environments, \n\ndifferentiation can be equated with competition between firms, whereas in a B2B context, the \n\nfocus on differentiation is to provide a product or service that meets the particular needs of the \n\ncustomers. \n\nDue to this distinction, for the marketing plan of Friesland Kabel, the so called SAVE \n\nframework will be applied since it considers the particularities of the business market \n\nenvironment. Based on the 4Ps (Product, Place, Price, and Promotion) (McCarthy, 1960, p. \n\n45) model the SAVE framework also consists of four basic elements: Solution, Access, \n\nValue, and Education (Ettenson, et al., 2013).  \n\n10.1 Solution \n\nCustomers do not merely buy products; they buy solutions in order to solve problems. \n\nSelling appropriate solutions in turn requires identifying the problems of customers (Freese, \n\n2010). So, what are the customer\u00b4s requirements for Friesland Kabel`s products? The most \n\nimportant aspect is that the products work reliably even under difficult environmental \n\nconditions. In other words, the function of the products is to avoid cause problems within \n\nalready complex processes. In this regard, Friesland Kabel\u00b4s products have all the necessary \n\ncharacteristics including robustness and oil-, fire- and temperature resistance. \n\nFurther customer needs are related to service. The firm has to be able to quickly adapt its \n\nproducts to the customer\u00b4s needs. This applies to the product characteristics as well as to the \n\nnumber of required products. Friesland Kabel offers customization, innovation and approved \n\nexperience within different environmental, technical and cultural contexts. Moreover, \n\nFriesland Kabel ensures through its comprehensive logistic concept that products are \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\ndelivered on time and complete and in case of increasing demand the company is able to \n\ndeliver additional products from stock. \n\n10.2 Access \n\nAccess is about making the product or service available to the customer. For this purpose, \n\ncompanies have to analyze where their customers are present and through what kind of \n\nchannels they can reach them (Ettenson, et al., 2013).  \n\nIn this connection, trade fairs or industry related events present the best opportunity. The \n\ntable below provides an overview about the major Brazilian trade fairs of the offshore sector. \n\n \n\nTable 21: Oil &amp; Gas Trade Fairs (Own Presentation, 2015) \n\nEvent Location Date Website \n\nBrasil Offshore Maca\u00e9  biennially \n\n20. -\n\n23.06.2017 \n\nhttp://www.brasiloffshore.com/ \n\n \n\nRio Oil &amp; Gas RJ  biennially \n\n2016  \n\nNot released \n\nhttp://www.riooilgas.com.br/main.asp?\n\nLangID=en \n\n(Website of 2014) \n\nOTC Brasil RJ biennially \n\n27.-29.10.2015 \n\nhttp://www.otcbrasil.org/pt/ \n\nRio Pipeline RJ biennially \n\n22-24.09.2015 \n\nhttp://www.riopipeline.com.br/ \n\nMarintec RJ yearly  \n\nSept 2016 \n\nhttp://marintecsa.com.br/pt \n\n \n\nA cheaper solution than fairs are ads in trade journals. The journal TN Petr\u00f3leo offers \n\ncompanies of the industry different formats in order to present their products and services in a \n\nprint run of over 15.00 exemplars per edition (TN Petr\u00f3leo, 2015).  \n\nAnother approach is to intensify the local presence in Brazil via distributors and by \n\nestablishing offices in the country. Due to the high concentration of oil and gas companies, \n\nsuppliers, shipyards, industry-specific research centers and specialized labor, Rio de Janeiro \n\nconstitutes the center of the Brazilian oil and gas industry. Further attractive industry related \n\nareas include the shipbuilding and maritime technology cluster in the southern state Rio \n\nGrande do Sul and the northern port complex Porto do A\u00e7u. (AHK; GTAI, 2014, pp. 52-54). \n\nAt these locations, potential distributors of Friesland Kabel have to be present and build up \n\nnetworks.  \n\nhttp://www.brasiloffshore.com/\nhttp://www.riooilgas.com.br/main.asp?LangID=en\nhttp://www.riooilgas.com.br/main.asp?LangID=en\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nMoreover, Brazil is one of the largest and fastest growing internet markets worldwide and \n\nis leading in the usage of social media (Barnett, 2011, p. 87). For that reason, investing in e-\n\ncommerce constitutes another possibility. Friesland Kabel already possesses a web presence \n\nin Portuguese, which is the first step in order to facilitate the online access for potential \n\ncustomers. Other possibilities are intensifying the presence on industry-specific platforms and \n\nportals. These includes memberships in associations such as the ABPG (= Associa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nBrasileira de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento em Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s), the ABPIP (=Associa\u00e7\u00e3o A \n\nAssocia\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira dos Produtores Independentes de Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s) or the search engine \n\nfor operational ship suppliers SHIPSERV (Shipserv, 2015). \n\n10.3 Value \n\nAccording to the SAVE model firms should focus on \u201carticulate the benefits relative to \n\nprice, rather than stressing how price relates to production costs, profit margins, or \n\ncompetitor\u2019s prices\u201d (Ettenson, et al., 2013). This is because customers do not solely consider \n\nprice but the value of products or services, which can be defined as the customer\u00b4s perceived \n\nbenefits minus customer\u00b4s price (Leszinski &amp; Marn, 1997).  \n\nDue to the fact that Friesland Kabel has to import its products, it must charge higher prices \n\nthan local producers. Nevertheless, Friesland Kabel can compensate its lack in price \n\ncompetitiveness through offering safe and high quality products in combination with a \n\ncomprehensive service.  \n\nBy applying this to Porters\u00b4s generic framework, Friesland Kabel should follow a \n\ndifferentiation-focused strategy where the company concentrates on producing specified \n\nproducts for the unique needs of the customer (needs-based positioning) (Porter, 2008b, p. 42) \n\n(Porter, 1980, pp. 35-39). In contrast, cost leadership is of secondary significance.  \n\n10.4 Education \n\nInstead of relying on advertising, PR and other promotional instruments Friesland Kabel \n\nshould focus on providing information \u201crelevant to their customer\u00b4s specific needs at each \n\npoint of the purchase cycle\u201d (Ettenson, et al., 2013).  \n\nAt the pre-purchase stage, the main objective of customer education is to provide \n\ncustomers with knowledge in order to increase their awareness and understanding of the \n\nproduct (Best, 2005, p. 69). This especially applies to technological product types where \n\ncustomers have to be educated about the applications of the product in order to assess the \n\nsuitability for their usage. For this purpose, Friesland Kabel should consider different types of \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\ndemonstration tools including face-to-face demonstration, video-clips, lectures and web-based \n\npresentations (Aubert, 2007, pp. 44-51).   \n\nAt the post-purchase stage, customer education aims mainly to provide customers with \n\nknowledge about how to use the products. To this aim, the company can use tutorials, \n\ncomputer-based training software and user hotlines (Aubert, 2007, pp. 44-51). \n\nFor both purchasing phases, Friesland Kabel might additionally implement an internal \n\nsystem where into which all employees who are in direct contact with customers can enter \n\ncustomer requests in order to adapt the prospective communication process.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n11 Action Plan \n\nAfter having chosen an appropriate set of strategies in chapter 8, these have to be translated \n\ninto concrete actions. For this purpose, action plans involve appropriate means and provide \n\nstrategy leaders with information in order to achieve specific strategic objectives. Thus, an \n\naction plan constitutes a link between strategy formulation and strategy implementation and \n\nprovides a basis for the evaluation of whether the developed strategies and objectives are \n\nachievable according to the capabilities and limitations of the company.  \n\nAn action plan is a precursor of an implementation program and provides only broad \n\ndirectives without going into details. Moreover, an action plan cannot be seen as an ultimate \n\nsolution but rather as a guideline which has to be adapted if objectives and strategies are not \n\nattainable (Rainey, 2010, pp. 413-415). \n\nThere are many ways to develop an action plan. Typically it contains the following \n\ncomponents (Harvard Business Review, 2009, p. 29): \n\n \n\n? Priority issue: Description of the broad area to be dealt with \n\n? The objectives of the strategic initiatives \n\n? The actions steps make up the main part of the action plan and specify in detail who \n\nwill do what, by when, to make which changes happen. \n\n? Resources (i. e., money, staff) which are necessary in order to carry out the actions \n\n? Potential barriers  \n\n? Communication lines that need to be active  \n\n \n\nIn the following, the different action steps according to the strategic objectives in chapter 9 \n\nwill be briefly explained. \n\n11.1 Compliance Officer \n\nFor the compliance strategy of Friesland Kabel, first of all a compliance officer has to be \n\nappointed and trained via seminars. For this, the German Technical Inspection Association \n\n(T\u00dcV) offers an internationally accepted compliance officer certification (T\u00dcV Rheinland, \n\n2015). The chosen employee will be the first contact person for compliance issues and \n\nresponsible for expressing the companies legal and ethical standards to the customers. The \n\ncompliance officer will create a corporate code of conduction and work together with the \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\nmarketing department in order to communicate the compliance activities through different \n\nchannels. \n\n11.2 Customer Management \n\nFriesland Kabel has to ensure that its performance is perceived positively by its customers. \n\nTherefore, the firm should conduct annual surveys to evaluate the customer\u2019s perception of \n\nFriesland Kabel\u00b4s products and services compared to those of other suppliers. Major \n\ncustomers should be asked to give a monthly feedback about their satisfaction with Friesland \n\nKabels performance. Additionally, regular personal contact to customers has to be maintained \n\nby local distributors. Implementing these measures will give Friesland Kabel a closer tie to its \n\nkey customers and a certain level of market feedback (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1993).  \n\n11.3 Partnership with GE Oil &amp; Gas \n\nA first step to provide state of the art technology and to adapt the products of Friesland \n\nKabel to the changing industry requirements is to build up partnerships with a local research \n\ncenter. As already mentioned, the Oil &amp; Gas research center of the American multinational \n\nconglomerate General Electric in Rio de Janeiro offers excellent conditions for this. Friesland \n\nKabel should try to get in contact with employees from the GE Oil &amp; Gas department. This \n\ntask can be taken over by a local Brazilian distributor who is also able to frequently arrange \n\npersonal meetings in order to discuss future joint projects. \n\nFurthermore, Friesland Kabel should register on the online GE online platform \u201cTechnical \n\nEnhancements &amp; Notifications\" in order to keep on the top of the latest technologies and \n\ntechnical upgrades applicable to their own products (General Electric, 2015).  \n\nThe acquired information has to be directly reported to Friesland Kabel\u00b4s supplier Helkma \n\nfor the integration of new technological requirements into the production process. \n\n11.4 Partner Relations \n\nSimilar to the contact with the research center, a regular exchange with the German-\n\nBrazilian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AHK Rio) and the Brazilian Trade and \n\nInvestment Promotion Agency (Apex-Brasil) has to be maintained in order to be informed \n\nabout new possibilities to develop Friesland Kabel\u00b4s business. The contact with the AHK Rio \n\ncould be done on a monthly basis in German language with the expert for oil and gas, Thomas \n\nOlsinger. For the communication with Apex-Brasil and the FIRJAN a local distributor or \n\nPortuguese speaking employee of Friesland Kabel is advisable. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n11.5 Stock Management \n\nAn investment in a local warehouse in Brazil should be first evaluated from a financial \n\nperspective. Therefore, the management and the accounting department should check their \n\nfinancial resources for such a project by considering the costs and return of investments. Once \n\nthe available funds are set, potential equity partners have to be identified and contacted.  \n\n11.6 Product Segment: Oil &amp; Gas \n\nFriesland Kabel\u00b4s products which are most suitable for the application in ultra-deep see \n\nareas (see chapter 8.7) have to be segmented into a specific category \u201coil and gas\u201d. For any \n\nmarketing strategies, these kinds of products and their special characteristics have to be \n\nemphasized. \n\n11.7 Partnership Selection \n\nFinding a strategic partner is a time-consuming task that should be carefully planned and \n\ndivided into several steps. First, potential partners have to be determined. This can be \n\nachieved by internet research, visiting trade fairs and with the support of the institutions \n\ndescribed above (AHK Rio, Apex-Brasil etc.). Then, these companies have to be contacted \n\nvia letters and phone calls. In a next step, the interested firms will be evaluated based on the \n\ncriteria outlined in chapter 9.6.4. Personal meetings complement the selection process and \n\noffer opportunities for fist contractual negotiations. \n\n11.8 Product Certification \n\nThe first step to becoming a supplier for Petrobras is to apply for the company\u00b4s online \n\nregistration system. For this, the guide in chapter 8.6 provides a basis. Of particular \n\nimportance in this context is the presentation of technical and managerial certificates. As \n\nmentioned in chapter 4.1, Friesland Kabel\u00b4s supplier Helkama already possesses some of \n\nthese certificates such as ISO-9001, ISO-14001 and several technical approvals (DNV, GL, \n\netc.) (Friesland Kabel, 2015). Additionally, Friesland Kabel and Helkama have to ensure that \n\nother certificates required by Petrobras including API, ASME and OHSAS 18001 will be \n\nobtained.  \n\n11.9 Market Entry Stages \n\nIn view of the economic crisis which seriously affects the oil and gas industry as well as \n\nthe shipbuilding sector, it is advisable that Friesland Kabel momentarily keep its investments \n\nin Brazil low in order to grant the possibility of restructurings or a temporary market exit. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nThis applies especially to acquisitions of tangible assets. Thus, at this stage the company \n\nshould focus on sales and marketing activities via on-site distributors on-site who are building \n\nup networks and trying to find commercial partners. Then, when the market begins to recover \n\nand the demand increases, Friesland Kabel should invest in a local stock facility with sales \n\noffices in order to exploit economies of scale and finally offer better prices and on-time \n\ndelivery to its clients. \n\n11.10 Action Plan Summary \n\nTable 22 summarizes the recommendations and management implications for Friesland Kabel \n\nelaborated within the present chapter and chapter 8. Additionally, for every action step a \n\ntimeline (completion date) has been set and responsible employees have been selected.   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 22: Summary Action Plan (Own Presentation, 2015) \n\nIssue Strategy Objective Action Steps Completion \n\nDate \n\nResponsible \n\nCorruption Compliance Represent the company as reliable \n\nand fair business partner \n?

However, investing in Brazil is associated with different sorts \n\nof business risks including corruption, inflation, infrastructure deficiencies and bureaucratic \n\nburdens. This is why Brazil is not the right place for short term and aggressive investments. In \n\ncontrast, long-term commitment and thorough strategic preparation are key success factors for \n\nthe performance in this dynamic market. \n\nAfter the economic boom in 2009, Brazil is currently fighting a \u201ccrisis of credibility\u201d in \n\nwhich the country has to regain the confidence of the population and foreign investors. At this \n\npoint, it is difficult to assess whether and when this downturn will stop. At any rate, in such a \n\nsituation and especially for new market entrants and SMEs such as Friesland Kabel, it is \n\nimportant to adapt the company\u00b4s strategies to this situation in order to avoid expensive and \n\ntime-consuming returns.  \n\nSimilar to the overall macroeconomic situation, the oil and gas sector as one of the major \n\nindustries within the country is simultaneously experiencing a tangible decrease in growth. \n\nThis is mainly caused by two factors: the fall in global oil prices and a series of corruption \n\naffairs involving the national energy cooperation Petrobras. Nevertheless, the market still \n\noffers huge potentials. This is especially true for the offshore sources in the pre-salt layer, \n\nwhere the production rates have been growing steadily over the last years and discoveries of \n\nnew sources are expected. Although the current four-year business plan of Petrobras provides \n\na reduction of expenses by 37%, the remaining amount of  US$ 130,3 billion still represents a \n\nhuge investment volume which corresponds to a value of US$ 3,7 million per hour.  \n\nWith regard to Friesland Kabel\u00b4s target market, three segments have been determined and \n\nanalyzed: First, the E&amp;P sector as the overall segment, second the shipbuilding industry and \n\nthird, the marine cable and network industry. Within the Brazilian oil and gas supply chain, \n\nE&amp;P activities, which concentrate 83% of Petrobras future investments, show by far the \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nbiggest market size and highest growth rates. On the contrary, the shipbuilding industry as a \n\nsub-market of the E&amp;P segment is experiencing a substantial contraction in which orders for \n\ntanker vessels, production units, supply vessels and drilling rigs have been radically reduced. \n\nFor the specific product segment of Friesland Kabel, little information could be obtained. \n\nHowever, due to the fact that marine cables and individual parts of network technology appear \n\non former procurement lists of Petrobras and Sinaval, a certain demand can be assumed.  \n\nConcerning the competition within the industry, the Porter 5 Forces analyses highlighted \n\nthe market predominance of Petrobras and the local content requirements as the key \n\ncompetitive factors. Whilst Petrobras already concentrates almost all suppliers of the market, \n\nlocal content requirement still increases the competition between foreign companies.  \n\nFrom an internal perspective different tangible and intangible resources of Friesland Kabel \n\ncould be identified. Among them, the specified product properties, the comprehensive \n\ncustomer service and the experience in international projects have been determined as sources \n\nof competitive advantage. Weaknesses of the company are mainly related to the absence of \n\nprice competitiveness, few financial resources and limited market knowledge.  \n\nIn total, on all three investigated dimensions favorable aspects as well as business \n\nrestrictions for Friesland Kabel have been identified. Despite the crisis within the country in \n\ngeneral and within the oil and gas industry in particular, both markets still offer certain \n\npotentials. Moreover, Friesland Kabel\u00b4s services and products show characteristics that are \n\nsources of sustainable competitive advantage and requested on the market.  \n\nConcerning the temporary crisis it has to be considered that other main oil and gas \n\nproducing countries are also affected of the declining oil prices. Against the background of \n\nincreasing global demand of energy resources by fast growing economies like India and China \n\nand in expectations of future rising oil prices, it can be assumed that the market will recover \n\nin the medium and long-term.  \n\n \n\nFor the strategy formulation of Friesland Kabel\u00b4s market entry into the Brazilian oil and \n\ngas industry, the following six strategy components have been developed (1) mission, vision \n\n&amp; objectives; (2) strategic position; (3) strategic actions; (4) entry mode; (5) marketing plan \n\nand (6) action plan. \n\nBy defining Friesland Kabel\u00b4s mission, vision and objectives it was possible to clarify the \n\nfundamental goals of the company within the market. As a first guiding framework, the \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nmission statement includes information about the target customers, their needs and the key \n\ncapabilities of the company. From a more contextual perspective, the vision statement focuses \n\non the core purpose and the long term goals of the firm. In order to translate these two \n\nconcepts into precise performance targets, basic objectives for Friesland Kabel\u00b4s key result \n\nbusiness areas were set. \n\nThe SWOT analysis served to specify the strategic starting position of Friesland Kabel by \n\ndetermining the most impactful external and internal factors from the first part of the study. \n\nOn this basis, the following strategic actions in order to leverage market opportunities and \n\novercome business restrictions have been developed: \n\n \n\n? Due to recent corruption scandals within the industry, a corporate compliance strategy \n\nsignalizes to Brazilian customers that Friesland Kabel is a reliable and fair business \n\npartner.  \n\n? A value-based marketing strategy emphasizes the company\u2019s internal strengths and \n\ncompensates the fact that the firm cannot compete on product prices with suppliers of \n\nlocally manufactured products. \n\n? The cooperation with research centers such as GE has the objective to constantly keep \n\nthe products and services adapted to the fast changing technical requirements of the \n\nindustry.  \n\n? Collaborations with institutions like the AHK Rio Janeiro, Appex Brasil or FIRJAN \n\noffer reliable support, especially in the first phase of the market entry. \n\n? The acquisition of a local warehouse in Brazil leads to reduced supplying times and \n\nimport costs, which in turn will have positive effects on service quality and price \n\ncompetiveness. \n\n? Through product segmentation, Friesland Kabel can increase its marketing efficiency \n\nby offering the individual products to a specific market segment in accordance with \n\nthe customer\u00b4s needs.  \n\n? Through strategic collaboration with a Brazilian company, Friesland Kabel might be \n\nable to overcome local content barriers, share risk and use the market knowledge of \n\nthe local partner. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\n? The customer acquisition of Petrobras can be achieved by applying directly for the \n\nregistration system or via an intermediary company which is already registered as a \n\nsupplier of Petrobras. \n\n? A staged marked expansion by which Friesland Kabel gradually increases its market \n\ncommitment allows the firm to accumulate knowledge while minimizing the \n\ninvestment risk. \n\n \n\nConcerning the market entry, a strategic partnership is the most appropriate entry mode for \n\nFriesland Kabel. The main motives to choose a cooperative strategy are an accelerated market \n\naccess, overcoming local content restrictions, financial risk minimization, compensating the \n\nlack of market knowledge and the reduction of competition. \n\nBased on the business model of Friesland Kabel, it has been shown that an export \n\ncooperation, by which the company exports its products directly to a joint distribution facility \n\nin the host country, is the most suitable option. This export variant is applicable to all three \n\nsize categories of partners, big, medium and small size. Here, Friesland Kabel does not have \n\nto commit itself since at this stage all three strategies are consistent with the company\u2019s vision \n\nand can be pursued simultaneously. For the evaluation of specific partners a framework based \n\non the most relevant selection criteria has been additionally elaborated. \n\nIn terms of Friesland Kabel\u00b4s marketing strategy, the SAVE model, as a special approach \n\nfor B2B environments, has been applied. The concept has demonstrated that for the most \n\nrelevant needs of Friesland Kabel\u00b4s potential customers, the company provides state-of-the-art \n\nsolutions and comprehensive logistical services. \n\nBased on these capabilities and the cost-disadvantage in relation to local competitors \n\nFriesland Kabel should follow a differentiation-focused marketing strategy by which the \n\ncompany concentrates on producing specified products rather than pursuing cost leadership. \n\nIn order to make these solutions accessible to its customers, international trade fairs and \n\nroad shows represent the most convenient distribution channels. Other sales tools include \n\nlocal distributors, advertisements in trade journals, e-commerce and memberships within \n\nindustry-specific platforms and portals. \n\nIn regard to the message that will be transmitted through these channels at the pre-purchase \n\nstage, the objective is to increase the customer\u2019s awareness and understanding of the products. \n\n\n\nThe Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: \n\n \n\n78 \n\n \n\nThe aim at the post-purchase stage is to provide knowledge about how to use the products. An \n\ninternal customer system additionally helps to update both types of information. \n\nTo sum up, the developed strategic tools provide an effective basis in order to overcome \n\nmost of the identified business barriers, exploit market opportunities and leverage internal \n\nstrengths. Nevertheless, the crisis in the related markets and segments still represents a huge \n\nchallenge which is outside of Friesland Kabel\u00b4s sphere of influence. For this reason, a market \n\nentry at that time cannot be recommended without restrictions. In any case, Friesland Kabel \n\nshould temporarily keep its commitment at a low level.
