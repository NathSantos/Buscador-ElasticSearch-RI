Exemplo disto \n\ns\u00e3o os cabe\u00e7otes de motor automotivos, submetidos a tens\u00f5es t\u00e9rmicas e mec\u00e2nicas \n\nrelativamente altas durante seu uso normal e alt\u00edssimo em condi\u00e7\u00f5es extremas. Durante longos \n\ntempos de funcionamento e eventuais falhas na refrigera\u00e7\u00e3o e ou lubrifica\u00e7\u00e3o a temperatura \n\npode chegar a valores pr\u00f3ximos de 300\u00baC. Esta varia\u00e7\u00e3o de temperaturas provoca choques \n\nt\u00e9rmicos que podem gerar trincas e/ou uma grande quantidade de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o pl\u00e1stica em \n\nregi\u00f5es pr\u00f3ximas aos pist\u00f5es. Desconsiderando a presen\u00e7a de choques t\u00e9rmicos provocados \n\npor falhas, ainda assim, uma pequena quantidade de ciclos de acionamento e parada do motor, \n\n\u00e9 considerada como os principais causadores de pequenas trincas. Isso indica que o \n\nsurgimento de trincas em cabe\u00e7otes de motor deve ser considerado um problema de fadiga \n\ntermomec\u00e2nica de baixo ciclo. Outro problema \u00e9 a heterogeneidade microestrutural no \n\ncomponente devido ao processo de fundi\u00e7\u00e3o, levando a propriedades mec\u00e2nicas e f\u00edsicas \n\ndiferentes em uma mesma pe\u00e7a. Al\u00e9m da presen\u00e7a de porosidade gerada por bolhas de g\u00e1s e \n\nvazios de solidifica\u00e7\u00e3o, que podem adquirir tamanho tal que se aproximem de pequenas \n\ntrincas, diminuindo a vida para a nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o e assim mudando o foco do problema para o de \n\npropaga\u00e7\u00e3o de trinca por fadiga. A proposta deste trabalho foi a de determinar as propriedades \n\nde fadiga isot\u00e9rmica e termomec\u00e2nica atrav\u00e9s de ensaios de fadiga de baixo ciclo, bem como \n\nas propriedades de propaga\u00e7\u00e3o de trinca por fadiga, relaxa\u00e7\u00e3o, caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o microestrutural \n\ne modelagem do comportamento mec\u00e2nico por elementos finitos para a liga de alum\u00ednio \n\nutilizada na fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de cabe\u00e7otes de motores automotivos pela ind\u00fastria nacional. Todos os \n\nensaios e an\u00e1lises computacionais foram realizados nos laborat\u00f3rios da Universidade de S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo (EESC-USP) e da \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan (ENS-LMT). Os ensaios de \n\nfadiga isot\u00e9rmica foram realizados nas temperaturas de 120\u00baC e 280\u00baC e os ensaios \n\ntermomec\u00e2nicos foram realizados em fase entre as temperaturas de 120\u00baC e 280\u00baC. Os ensaios \n\nde relaxa\u00e7\u00e3o foram realizados em v\u00e1rias temperaturas com carregamento de onda trapezoidal, \n\nenquanto que os ensaios de propaga\u00e7\u00e3o de trinca por fadiga foram realizados nas temperaturas \n\nde 120\u00baC, 200\u00baC e 280\u00baC para carregamentos de onda senoidal e trapezoidal em controle de \n\ncarga e de deslocamento. Foi feita tamb\u00e9m an\u00e1lise microestrutural nos corpos de prova, ap\u00f3s \n\nos ensaios de fadiga, por microscopia \u00f3ptica e por microscopia eletr\u00f4nica de varredura MEV. \n\nOs resultados destes ensaios mostraram que os defeitos de fundi\u00e7\u00e3o e a falta de \n\nhomogeneidade no material, aliados a longos tempos de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a carregamentos e em altas \n\ntemperaturas, constituem um fator cr\u00edtico no desempenho do componente.

Fatigue Life Evaluation of A356 Aluminum Alloy used for Engine \n\nCylinder Head. 2011. 201p. Tese (Doutorado) \u2013 Escola de Engenharia de S\u00e3o Carlos, \n\nInstituto de F\u00edsica de S\u00e3o Carlos, Instituto de Qu\u00edmica de S\u00e3o Carlos, Universidade de S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo, S\u00e3o Carlos, 2011. \n\n \n\nIn order to characterize mechanical components used in high responsibility applications, the \n\nknowledge of chemical composition and results from regular experiments such as traction, \n\nimpact and hardness tests is important, but not sufficient. They cannot supply the necessary \n\ninformation that permit anticipating, in a reliable way, the components\u2019 behavior in actual \n\nworking conditions. As an example, there are engine\u2019s cylinder head submitted to mechanical \n\nand thermal tensions that are relatively high during the in service use, and very high in same \n\nvery demanding condition. During long run times and any failure in the cooling and/or \n\nlubrication the temperature may reach 300\u00baC. This temperature variation causes thermal \n\nshocks which may generate cracks and/or a wide ranging of plastic deformation in regions \n\nclose to the pistons. Even not considering the thermal shock effects caused by failure, even so, \n\na short number of start-up and shutdown cycles of engine, are considered the main cause of \n\nsmall cracks. This indicates that the generation of cracks in cylinder head may be considered \n\nas low cycle thermomechanical fatigue problem. Another problem is the microstructure \n\nheterogeneity in the component due to the casting process, leading to different physical and \n\nmechanical properties in the same piece. Besides the presence of porosity generated by gas \n\nbubbles and voids of solidification, which may be as great as short crack, reducing the \n\nnucleation life and changing the problem\u2019s focus for the fatigue crack growth. The purpose of \n\nthis study was to determine the isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue property through \n\nlow cycle fatigue, as well as the fatigue crack growth, relaxation, microestrutural \n\ncharacterization and modeling of mechanical behavior by finite element for the aluminum \n\nalloy employed in the manufacture of engine cylinder head by the national automotive \n\nindustry. All tests and computer analysis were performed in the laboratories of the University \n\nof S\u00e3o Paulo (EESC-USP) and the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan (ENS-LMT). \n\nIsothermal fatigue experiments were carried out at temperature of 120\u00baC and 280\u00baC and the \n\nthermomechanical performed in phase between the temperatures of 120\u00baC and 280\u00baC. The \n\nrelaxation experiments were performed at some temperatures with trapezoidal wave loading, \n\nwhereas the experiments of fatigue crack growth carried out at temperatures of 120\u00baC, 200\u00baC \n\nand 280\u00baC for sine and trapezoidal wave loading in displacement and load control. The \n\nmicrostructure analysis was also made in the specimens after the fatigue test by optical \n\nmicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy SEM. The results of these experiments showed \n\nthat the casting defects and material\u2019s inhomogeneities, coupled long run times in high \n\ntemperatures and loads, are a critical factor in the component performance. These results help \n\nus to establish accurate models for life prediction of the engine cylinder head. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Aluminum Alloys. Cylinder head.

Des exemples sont des \n\nculasses du moteur, soumis \u00e0 des contraintes thermiques et m\u00e9caniques relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 en \n\nutilisation normale et tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans des conditions extr\u00eames. Pour de longues p\u00e9riodes de \n\nfonctionnement et pour d\u2019eventuels d\u00e9fauts de refroidissement ou de lubrification la \n\ntemp\u00e9rature peut atteindre des valeurs proches de 300\u00b0C. Cette variation de temp\u00e9rature \n\nprovoque un choc thermique qui peut provoquer des fissures et/ou une grande quantit\u00e9 de \n\nd\u00e9formation plastique dans les r\u00e9gions proches des pistons. Sans tenir compte la pr\u00e9sence de \n\nchocs thermiques caus\u00e9s par des d\u00e9faillance, encore,  une petite quantit\u00e9 de cycles de d\u00e9marrer \n\net d'arr\u00eat du moteur, est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la principale cause des fissures petites. Cela \n\nindique que l'apparition de fissures dans la culasses du moteur doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \n\nun probl\u00e8me de fatigue thermom\u00e9canique oligocyclique. An autre probl\u00e8me est la \n\nh\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 de la microstructure du composante en raison du processus de fonderie, \n\nconduisant \u00e0 des diff\u00e9rents propri\u00e9t\u00e9s physiques et m\u00e9caniques dans la m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce. De plus, \n\nla pr\u00e9sence de porosit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 par les bulles de gaz et les vides de la solidification, qui peut \n\nobtenir une telle taille qui viennent \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 des petits fissures, r\u00e9duisant la vie \u00e0 la \n\nnucl\u00e9ation et donc changer le centre de l'attention pour la propagation des fissures par fatigue. \n\nLe but de cette \u00e9tude \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des essais de fatigue isotherme et \n\nthermom\u00e9canique utilisant de fatigue oligocyclique, ainsi que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de propagation \n\ndes fissures de fatigue, la relaxation, la caract\u00e9risation et la mod\u00e9lisation du comportement \n\nm\u00e9canique par \u00e9l\u00e9ments finis pour une alliage d\u2019aluminium utilis\u00e9 dans la fabrication de \n\nculasse du moteur automobile par l\u2019industrie nationale. Tous les essais et l'analyse num\u00e9rique \n\nont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es dans les laboratoires de l'Universit\u00e9 de S\u00e3o Paulo (USP-EESC) et l'\u00c9cole \n\nNormale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan (ENS-LMT).

machines have several types of components subjected to variations in \n\ntemperature or load during operation. The induced thermal gradient inside these components \n\ncan promote internal stresses and strains and repeated thermal cycles may lead to crack \n\nnucleation and propagation by a process known as thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF). \n\nThis process can be clearly seen in internal combustion engines. When this type of \n\nengine is started, the temperature of the head and valves increases rapidly at the same time \n\nthat the nearby material, which is water cooled, restrains the thermal expansion of the \n\nmaterial. As a result, there is an increase in thermal stress and significant plastic deformation \n\nmay occur at high temperatures if it exceeds the elastic limit under compression of the \n\nmaterial. \n\nMoreover, upon cooling to room temperature, tensile stresses are created and may \n\npromote cracks and be conducive to component failure (Figure 1). Repeated engine startup-\n\nshutdown cycles can cause these components to undergo plastic deformation, leading to \n\nstress-strain hysteresis loops and, consequently, TMF. Therefore, the study of the material \n\nmechanical behavior and fracture mechanisms is vital to a proper engineering design of these \n\ncomponents. \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Picture of a fatigue crack that caused the cylinder head to fail during operation. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nMaterials employed in the making of automotive engine cylinder heads are often \n\nsubmitted to critical thermo-mechanical efforts. The development of new materials for the \n\nautomotive industry has been hitherto based almost exclusively on laboratorial specimen \n\ntesting. The financial cost and time expenditure involved in the process, from selection of \n\nmaterials to approval for serial production, are high, demanding a wide array of mechanical \n\ntests. From project planning to production, there is a series of stages before the component is \n\napproved. \n\nFor example, in the case of an engine cylinder head, some of these steps comprise \n\ndynamometer tests, whose cost is around R$ 140,000, durability tests (R$ 150,000), piloting it \n\nin some 300 vehicles, and so forth. Therefore, minor project faults may cause huge financial \n\nlosses and waste of time, which can be minimized by computational simulation. Nowadays, \n\nthere are several models that enable the accurate modeling of the behavior of many materials \n\nsubmitted to isothermal loading. However, only recently has intensive development of \n\nbehavior laws under anisothermal conditions started. In some cases, isothermal models can be \n\nextrapolated for anisothermal solicitation, but some materials display interaction effects \n\nduring the thermal cycle, which can alter their mechanical behavior and lead to non-\n\nconservative predictions of residual lifetime. In this context, it is fundamental to conduct \n\nanisothermal testing.  \n\nAnother problem is the casting-related microstructural heterogeneity, which can give \n\nrise to different mechanical and physical properties in the same component. Finite elements \n\nanalysis have been used to model casting processes as well as components under real-life \n\noperational conditions so as to build satisfactory predictive mathematical models capable of \n\ndetermining fatigue lifetime of components, thereby diminishing the cost of material selection \n\nand/or improvement. This study deals with this problem by investigating its influence on the \n\ncomponent under loading conditions closest to those observed in real life. Therefore, \n\ninvestigating the mechanical behavior and developing constitutive equations for these \n\nmaterials are vital to better determine their residual lifetime and implement projects of \n\ncomponents more effectively.  \n\nIn the industrial context of this study, i.e., production of cylinder heads of automotive \n\nengines, the choice of aluminum alloys is based on their good thermal conductivity (better \n\nengine cooling), good fluidity (implementation of part in casting), easy machining, and low \n\nweight. However, increased engine performance produces ever-higher operating \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\ntemperatures\u2014particularly with diesel engines\u2014between intake valves, the warmest areas of \n\nthe head. \n\nAlthough there are studies on the morphology and development of cast aluminum \n\nalloys, the literature is deficient with regard to cyclic mechanical behavior of these alloys \n\nunder varying temperature conditions, such as those found in transmission housings and \n\ncylinder heads of engines. \n\nNumerical simulation is a useful tool for solving equations that predict material \n\nbehavior. The finite element method (FEM) has been developed and applied very \n\nsatisfactorily. Basically, micro-structural features and thermal, mechanical and geometrical \n\naspects should be incorporated into TMF process modeling. There are two approaches to \n\nunderstanding the TMF process: (1) by modeling crack initiation and propagation at the \n\nmicroscopic level, and (2) by taking into account the material macroscopic behavior. \n\nThis study aimed to characterize the mechanical behavior of an aluminum alloy used \n\nin the production of automotive engine cylinder heads through mechanical testing laboratory \n\nconducted under conditions of loadings closer to reality of component operation and \n\nnumerical simulation using a Finite Element Software. It is expected that the results presented \n\nin this study will provide support to product development areas in industry. \n\n  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1: MATERIAL \n\n \n\n1.1 Metal Alloys in Molten State \n\n \n\nCasting is defined as the process of manufacturing metal parts from the liquid state. \n\nAfter melting, the metal is poured into molds to obtain components with complex geometries \n\nand/or close to final measures, in order to avoid waste of raw material and excessive \n\nmachining costs. It is the oldest manufacturing process in recorded history, known for \n\nthousands of years. Even today it is one of the most widely used processes because it is \n\nrelatively simple and comparatively inexpensive, though it may require the control of a large \n\nnumber of variables. \n\nThe production of most metal components involves solidification, a cooling \n\nphenomenon during which liquid metal is transformed into finished solid objects or ingots, \n\nwhich are then processed by other forming means. Basically, the solidification process can be \n\ndivided into nucleation and growth stages. \n\nDuring nucleation, liquids present a disordered structure, in which atoms and \n\nmolecules are in constant motion, with no fixed positions. As temperature drops, the total \n\nenergy of atoms decreases thereby increasing the force of attraction among them. At a given \n\npoint, a set of atoms may arrange themselves according to metal crystallographic rules in a \n\nsmall area of the liquid, forming a solid nucleus. The development process of stable nuclei \n\nrequires that the system temperature be below the metal solidification point for the energy \n\nbalance to promote its stabilization. \n\nIf the super-cooling level is not sufficient, the nucleus can become unstable and melt \n\nagain. The process may repeat until the temperature is low enough for the formed nuclei to \n\ndisplay a minimum curvature radius, one that results in an energetically stable structure, as \n\nshown schematically in Figure 2a. This process is known as homogeneous nucleation. In pure \n\nmetals, the super-cooling temperature needed for stable nucleation to occur may be in the \n\norder of hundreds of degrees Celsius, e.g., development of stable nuclei in iron only occurs at \n\napproximately 300\u00b0C below its solidification temperature. \n\nNevertheless, under real conditions, the presence of impurities and the mold walls \n\ncontaining the liquid advance nucleus development. In this case, nucleation is called \n\nheterogeneous. The presence of elements foreign to the liquid diminishes the amount of \n\nordered atoms needed to develop into a solid particle with the minimum curvature radius \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nrequired for stabilization (Figure 2b). Most cases of inoculation during casting are based on \n\nthe principle of heterogeneous nucleation, in which particles are intentionally introduced into \n\nthe liquid in order to act as nucleation substrates. The result is a structure with fine particle \n\nsize and better mechanical properties. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2: (a) Homogeneous nucleation and (b) heterogeneous nucleation (Milan, 2004). \n\n \n\nAfter being formed, nuclei tend to grow by accumulation of more solid matter around \n\nthem. This growth may be planar or dendritic. \n\nIf the liquid beyond the solid/liquid interface is at a temperature above fusion, the \n\ndevelopment of protuberances is inhibited and there occurs planar growth of the crystal solid, \n\nas shown in Figure 3a. Latent solidification heat is removed by thermal conduction through \n\nthe mold walls and, consequently, through the solid formed. \n\nDendritic growth is favored when the liquid is in a super-cooled state, i.e., at a \n\ntemperature (Tl) below its melting point (Tf). In this case, the removal of latent heat needed \n\nfor solidification of the liquid occurs by heat transfer, from the interface area to the super-\n\ncooled liquid beyond. This mechanism favors the development of tree-shaped protuberances \n\nin the solid/liquid interface, called dendrites, as represented in Figure 3b. Development and \n\ngrowth of dendrites continue until super-cooling of the liquid continues or when they are \n\nblocked by the development/growth of other adjacent dendrites. Figure 4 shows the \n\nappearance of dendritic solidification on the fracture surface of an aluminum alloy with high \n\nsilicon content. \n\nrcrit \n\nSolid-liquid interface \n\nrcrit \n\nSubstrate \n\n(a) \n\nLiquid \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3: Schematic representation of (a) planar growth and (b) dendritic growth (Milan, \n\n2004). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Solidification dendrites of an aluminum alloy with high silicon content (Milan, \n\n2004). \n\n \n\n1.2 Cast Aluminum Alloys  \n\n \n\nPure aluminum is seldom used because its physic-chemical properties are poor. \n\nNonetheless, its alloys are employed widely in automotive and aeronautical industry. \n\nAluminum alloys\u2014due to their good mechanical properties and low specific weight\u2014\n\nhave been increasingly employed in the production of molded parts, especially in place of iron \n\nalloys. The specific weight of aluminum is approximately one third that of iron. Another \n\nimportant aspect favoring the use of aluminum is related to its recycling, which allows an \n\noverall assessment of costs compatible to iron components. \n\nThe structure of aluminum alloys comprises solid solutions in the form of more or less \n\ncomplex (binary and tertiary) dendrites (hypo-eutectic) and inter-metallic liquid components. \n\nSolid Liquid \n\nHeat \n\nextraction \n\nTl  > Tf \n\nSolid Liquid \n\nHeat \n\nextraction \n\nTl  &lt;Tf \n\nGrowth \n\nGrowth \n\n            (a)                        (b) \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nIn the Al-Si system, solid crystals of aluminum are formed on the metal mold walls and grow \n\ninwardly. Its Si composition is lower than that of the liquid that surrounds it, because Si \n\nsolubility in Al decreases with temperature. Therefore, silicon is forced out to the interface \n\nbetween the liquid and the surface of growing crystals, thus lowering the solidification \n\ntemperature of the liquid in the region through cryoscopy (liquid state below its normal \n\nsolidification temperature). \n\nThis phenomenon slows solidification of this layer, since it requires that an above \n\nnormal amount of heat be removed for it to occur. But if growing crystal germs find liquid at \n\na below solidification temperature, thereby consisting of a silicon-poor medium \n\nthermodynamically favorable to solidification, they keep on growing as dendrites. \n\nThese initially unstable protuberances grow rapidly, which explains the fact that \n\naluminum crystals develop into tree-like shapes (dendrites) instead of spheres or needles \n\n(Figure 5). Secondary arms are dozens of micrometers apart. This distance between dendrite \n\narms is known as dendrite arm spacing (DAS) or secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5: Schematic representation of a dendrite (Massinon &amp; Constantin, 2002). \n\n \n\nThen, the eutectic solidifies amid dendrite arms, which are rich in silicon rejected from \n\nthe solidification front (excess silicon in this region). This enriches the surrounding liquid \n\nmetal with silicon, which, upon precipitating as platelets, drains silicon from the solution and \n\ncreates an almost pure aluminum region in the vicinity. An aluminum lamella is, thus, formed. \n\nLittle by little a lamellar eutectic is formed via competitive growth (Figure 6a). \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n                                     (a)                                                                             (b) \n\nFigure 6: (a) Principle of competitive growth leading to a lamellar eutectic, and (b) schematic \n\nrepresentation of a lamellar eutectic (Barralis J., Maeder G., 1997). \n\n \n\nFor instance, in heads of diesel engines, SDAS typically varies from 20?m inside the \n\ncomponent to about 100?m in areas at lower temperatures. The grain size in cast aluminum \n\nalloys is generally in the order of millimeters and, therefore, well above the size of a dendrite. \n\nThe mechanical properties of cast aluminum alloys strongly depend on micro-structural \n\nparameters; there are numerous studies that examine this dependence. \n\nThe acquisition of a given mechanical property also depends on the casting method \n\nemployed (e.g., sand mold, permanent mold, lost-wax, and die casting). In fact, permanent \n\nmold casting promotes fast cooling, which provides the component with a thinner metallic \n\nstructure (i.e., low SDAS) and higher tensile strength and elongation values as compared to \n\nthose of the same alloy cast in sand, for instance. However, sand mold casting is easy to \n\nimplement and prototypes can be quickly built in order to validate geometry, power, cooling, \n\nand so forth (except product life). It has been observed that low SDAS improves life under \n\nfatigue. According to empirical law, the shorter the solidification time (  ), the lower is SDAS \n\n(fast cooling): \n\n            \n   \n\n (1) \n\nwhere   and   are constants. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nSolidification in the mold occurs on its walls first and progresses toward the center \n\nuntil the entire component is solid. This induces a gradient of microstructure and, \n\nconsequently, properties. The literature also indicates the existence of a larger amount of \n\npores and eutectic phase in the center, influenced by a lower cooling rate (Equation 1), which \n\ntogether with higher SDAS, leads to a shorter life under fatigue of specimens taken from this \n\nregion as compared to those taken from outer regions, where cooling rates are higher. \n\nBesides the influence of the casting method employed, it is also possible to alter the \n\nproperties of alloys by adding different elements to them. Thus, cast aluminum alloys \n\nconstitute several families of materials whose chemical composition depends on the \n\nrelationship between casting requirements (e.g., flowability, machinability, shrinkage) and the \n\nway the component will be used (e.g., mechanical properties, surface appearance, and \n\ncorrosion strength). \n\nAluminum alloys employed in casting are classified according to their main alloying \n\nelements. The most common of these classifications is that established by the Aluminum \n\nAssociation and adopted by other standards bodies (e.g., ASTM and SAE). According to this \n\nclassification, the most important families are: \n\na) 1xx.x \u2013 pure aluminum alloys; \n\nb) 2xx.x \u2013 aluminum-copper alloys; \n\nc) 3xx.x \u2013 aluminum-silicon alloys (with addition of magnesium and/or copper); \n\nd) 4xx.x \u2013 aluminum-silicon alloys; \n\ne) 5xx.x \u2013 aluminum-magnesium alloys; \n\nf) 7xx.x \u2013 aluminum-zinc alloys (with addition of magnesium, copper, chromium, \n\nmanganese or combinations of the same); \n\ng) 8xx.x \u2013 aluminum-tin alloys. \n\nThe last digit (after the dot) is employed to describe the nature of the alloy. Therefore, \n\nthe digit ?0? indicates the chemical composition limits; ?1? and ?2? represent cast \n\ncomponents and ingots with pre-adjusted composition, respectively. \n\nVariations in the original chemical composition\u2014usually at impurity level\u2014are \n\nindicated with a capital letter before the alloy number (e.g., 356, A356, A356). \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nAlloys from 3xx.x and 4xx.x families are the most important, commercially, because \n\nof their mechanical, corrosion, and casting properties. Alloys belonging to families with \n\nsilicon as their main alloying component represent over 90% of all cast products. \n\nThe other families of alloys display low castability levels, but with specific advantages \n\nsuch as: high mechanical properties (2xx), corrosion strength (5xx) or machinability (5xx, \n\n7xx, and 8xx). \n\nTable 1 shows an overview of the series of most used aluminum alloys, along with \n\ntheir classification given by the AA (Aluminum Association), characteristics, and uses.

Binary alloys have excellent \n\nductility, corrosion strength, and good tensile strength. Si increases creep, reduces shrinkage, \n\nand improves weldability. However, high levels of Si hinder machining. \n\nCu addition to Al-Si alloys improves machinability and increases mechanical strength, \n\nbut reduces ductility. Mg addition allows alloys to be hardened by heat treatment thereby \n\nincreasing their mechanical strength. \n\nAlloys with lower Si concentrations (5 to 7%) are usually employed in sand mold \n\ncasting whereas alloys with high Si content (9 to 13%) are commonly used in permanent mold \n\nor pressure casting. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nHypereutectic alloys (up to 13% silicon) are known for their high wear strength, low \n\nthermal expansion coefficient, and high thermal conductivity. \n\nHetke and Gundlach (1994) sustain that the aluminum-silicon-magnesium alloy is \n\namong the easiest to cast irrespective of the casting technique employed. Its main features are \n\ngood mechanical strength, high corrosion strength, heat treatability, and weldability, \n\naccording to ASTM B108-97 (1997). This alloy is commonly used in the annealed condition \n\nand artificially aged, heat treatment T6. However, for casts with greater dimensional stability, \n\nit can be used in the solubilized and over-aged condition, T7, resulting in an increase in \n\nductility with a slight reduction in strength as compared to T6, according to Byczynski et al. \n\n(1996). \n\nDuring solubilization, magnesium is dissolved into the aluminum matrix after \n\nquenching and subsequent aging at intermediate temperatures (between 150\u00b0C and 200\u00b0C); \n\nthe Mg2Si phase precipitates in the aluminum matrix in the form of finely dispersed particles, \n\nwhich causes a substantial increase in strength, according to Wang and C\u00e1ceres (1997), Lee et \n\nal. (1998), and Zhang (1996). \n\nStrength and fracture toughness of the metal matrix can be controlled by varying the \n\ntemperature and aging time. In general, strength is inversely related to ductility and \n\ntoughness. However, toughness can be increased through heat treatment, to the detriment of \n\nstrength. \n\nHetke and Gundlach (1994) claim that when the metallurgical quality of castings \n\nlowers, both strength and toughness decrease. Whenever high toughness values are required, \n\nthere are three ways of achieving these characteristics: \n\n1. By performing the sub-aging treatment; \n\n2. By softening via over-aging treatment; \n\n3. By improving the quality of the cast. \n\nThe first two methods result in decreased mechanical strength and the last one \n\nincreases toughness and strength. The quality of cast aluminum is influenced by various \n\nmicro-structural factors, including the level of silicon modifiers, non-metallic inclusions, \n\nundesirable inter-metallic phases, micro-porosity, and grain refinement. These characteristics \n\nhave a major impact on the cast fracture toughness and ductility. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nThe main applications involve general-use components, intake manifolds, cylinder \n\nengine blocks and heads, automotive and wheel pistons, structural aerospace components, fuel \n\nand water pumps, and housing and suspension components. \n\n \n\n1.3.1 Silicon Modifiers \n\n \n\nThe vast majority of cast components in aluminum alloys employ Al-Si alloys. It \n\nhappens that the raw microstructure of these cast alloys features Si particles with acicular \n\nmorphology, which is detrimental to ductility (Figure 7). Then, it is necessary to modify this \n\nmorphology in order to obtain high strength and ductility. \n\nThe modification consists of an aluminum-silicon bath treatment by adding agents that \n\nmodify Si-morphology. The most commonly used modifiers are: Na (sodium), Sr (strontium), \n\nCa (calcium), and Sb (antimonium). \n\nAdditions of these elements (generally between 0.005% and 0.02% in weight) promote \n\nmajor changes in the growth of the   phase (silicon) of the eutectic, which begins to display a \n\nmore refined morphology, thus increasing the ductility of Al-Si alloy casts. \n\nIrrespective of the modification treatment employed, high cooling rates, such as those \n\nobtained in metallic molds, contribute to refine grain size and the eutectic structure itself. \n\nThey are also capable of changing the   phase morphology in the same way that it occurs \n\nchemically, besides contributing to reducing micro-porosity. \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7: Morphological modifications in Si particles. \n\n \n\nSodium and strontium are employed commercially as effective eutectic modifiers. \n\nThese elements, when added in appropriate amounts, refine and change the morphology of the \n\n? phase of the eutectic from acicular or coarse lamellar to fibrous. This morphological change \n\npromotes substantial improvement in mechanical properties, especially ductility. \n\nModification with strontium is accomplished through the addition of strontium (Sr) in \n\nmetal form of as Al-Sr pre-alloys. In general, additions are in the order of 0.02% Sr, which \n\nrequires a 15-minute incubation time for bathing with little agitation. \n\nModification with sodium is done by adding metal sodium or fluxes containing this \n\nelement. Sodium is a more efficient modifier than strontium, providing better modification \n\ndegrees. However, due to a greater tendency to vaporize, its modifying effect is lost faster \n\nthan that of strontium. In Na-modified baths, the modifying effect remains for about 30 \n\nminutes. In the case of Sr, the effect lasts more than two hours. Another negative aspect of Na \n\nis the damage it causes to melting crucibles. \n\nGaniev and Vakhobov (1983) and Beumler and colleagues (1988) indicate that small \n\nadditions of these elements change the morphology of the eutectic silicon phase from a coarse \n\nplate-shaped phase to a refined fibrous eutectic. The result is that fragile silicon particles \n\nbecome small finely-divided fibers, rather than broad and coarse plates that act as stress \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nconcentrators and weakness planes that promote crack propagation, according to Wang and \n\nC\u00e1ceres (1998) and Digho and Gokhale (1997). \n\nThe degree of silicon modification may vary from weak refinement, resulting in \n\nsilicon platelets, to a thorough change, resulting in refined silicon fibers. According to Hetke \n\nand Gundlach (1994), the amount of Sr or Na required to promote thorough modification is \n\nstrongly correlated with the solidification rate. The higher the cooling rate, the smaller is the \n\nrequired amount of modifiers. At low solidification rates, the required amount of modifiers is \n\nmuch greater. It may be very difficult to alter some larger sections of castings. However, high \n\nsolidification rates promote high modification degrees and, consequently, improve mechanical \n\nproperties. \n\nNa and Sr are mutually compatible so it is possible to use both simultaneously, \n\ncausing no problems due to scrap contamination. \n\nAs compared to non-modified alloys, the alloys treated with sodium and strontium \n\nshow higher tendency to micro-porosity and lower propensity to macro-shrinkages in the \n\nthicker areas of the components. \n\nTechnologically speaking, this feature of modified alloys allows the production of \n\nparts with less need for hot top. At the same time, it is virtually impossible to eliminate micro-\n\nporosity formed in all component sections. Modified cast alloys with sodium or strontium \n\nshould not be used when micro-porosity is not tolerated. In these applications, the use of \n\nunmodified alloys promotes to healthier parts. On the other hand, it requires feeding (hot top) \n\nin all thick areas where macro-shrinkages concentrate. \n\nAn alternative to modification with sodium or strontium is that with antimonium. \n\nWhen this treatment is employed, the   phase morphology remains lamellar, undergoing just \n\none refinement, which is enough to develop components with higher degree of reliability than \n\nthat obtained in non-modified alloys. \n\nAntimonium is widely used in Japan and parts of Europe. Strontium and, to a lesser \n\nextent, sodium are commonly used in the United States, Canada, parts of Europe, and Brazil. \n\nCalcium has, even today, little commercial application as a modifier. \n\nAnother kind of eutectic silicon modification takes place during solubilization \n\ntreatment. Solubilization temperatures are high enough to allow silicon migration and later \n\nspheroidization. The eutectic silicon particles undergo dissolution and partial agglomeration. \n\nThis type of silicon modification also promotes ductility. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3.2 Non-Metallic Inclusions \n\n \n\nInclusions are foreign materials present in aluminum that can compromise its physical \n\nand chemical characteristics, such as reducing its mechanical and corrosion strength, as well \n\nas cause quality problems in the final product. There has been a constant search for \n\nunderstanding their origin and means to detect and control them. \n\nMolten aluminum alloys contain highly reactive metals and oxidation of the molten \n\nmetal is fast. Even in a protective atmosphere, a metal can initiate the process of oxidation. \n\nVery large oxide inclusions are not readily wet by the molten alloy and act as discontinuities, \n\nwhich drastically reduces mechanical strength and ductility. Furthermore, they can greatly \n\nreduce fatigue resistance, shortening the component life. \n\nAccording to Crepeau (1998), various kinds of insoluble sludge can develop in molten \n\naluminum alloys at high concentrations of certain impurities. This sludge can gather in the \n\nliquid pool and later contribute to defects arising in the cast. Over time, it attaches to the \n\ncrucible bottom. Both oxides and sludge must be removed by having the liquid metal filtered \n\nbefore it enters the mold cavity. \n\n \n\n1.3.3 Inter-Metallic Phases \n\n \n\nIn furnaces operating at low temperatures in which aluminum is not subjected to \n\nagitation, alloying elements, such as iron, chromium, manganese, and copper, precipitate and \n\nthus form a mud or sand at the bottom of the furnace or crucible. Under favorable conditions, \n\nthese alloying elements, which by nature present high density, have their solubility limits \n\ndiminished and thus accumulate at the bottom of the furnace, forming high-density/hardness \n\ncompounds. Their development is predictable as it derives from the percentile participation of \n\nthese alloying elements in aluminum, determined by a so-called Segregation Factor, which is \n\ncalculated as follows: \n\n                   (2) \n\nThe temperature required to dissolve inter-metallic compounds increases with iron, \n\nmanganese, and chromium content, as shown in Figure 8. \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8: Segregation Factor \n\n \n\nWithout adequate control, the impurity content may rise to undesirable levels, \n\nresulting in the development of inter-metallic phases, which precipitate in inter-dendritic \n\nregions and around grains. These phases usually give rise to acicular platelets or inter-\n\ndendritic eutectic lattices, which can reduce matrix continuity. As a result, these hard particles \n\nact as stress raisers, propitiating crack development and decreasing fracture toughness, \n\naccording to Verdu et al. (1996), and fatigue strength, according to Madelaine-Dupuich and \n\nStolarz (1996). \n\nHetke and Gundlach (1994) sustain that iron and copper are major impurities in Al-Si \n\nalloys. Iron is particularly damaging because of development of acicular platelets, which \n\nsignificantly reduce ductility and fracture toughness. The size of acicular particles and, \n\nconsequently, their influence on ductility are also affected by the solidification rate. When \n\nbalanced with magnesium, iron forms a more compact eutectic phase, i.e., Al15(Fe,Mn)3Si2, \n\nshaped as ?chinese writing?, less detrimental to mechanical properties, as indicated by \n\nCrepeau (1998). \n\nCrepeau (1998) conducted detailed studies on the effect of added iron on the \n\nmechanical properties of aluminum-silicon alloys. Vorren and colleagues (1984) observed \n\nthat the effect of iron on ductility is highly dependent on the solidification rate. Kim and \n\ncolleagues (1996) studied the effect of iron on mechanical properties (i.e., impact and fatigue) \n\nof aluminum-silicon alloys. Murali and colleagues (1996) investigated the addition of \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nberyllium to aluminum-silicon alloys with the intention of nullifying the harmful effect of \n\niron on mechanical properties. Figure 9 shows the influence of iron content, solidification \n\nrate, and SDAS (secondary dendrite arm spacing) on fracture toughness, ductility, and silicon \n\nparticle size of the   phase in a aluminum alloy (Al-7Si-0.4Mg). \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 9: Influence of iron content, solidification rate, and SDAS on fracture toughness, \n\nductility, and particle size in   phase in an aluminum alloy (Al-7Si-0,4Mg) (Campbell, \n1991). \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n1.3.4 Grain Refinement and Porosity \n\n \n\nPorosity in aluminum alloys is responsible for decrease in mechanical strength and \n\noccurrence of cracks and thus constitutes an important problem. According to Hetke and \n\nGundlach (1994) and Anson and Gruzleski (1999), two varieties of micro-porosity can occur \n\nin aluminum castings: porosity resulting from gas (hydrogen) and porosity deriving from \n\nmicro-contraction due to solidification. \n\nPorosity caused by gas can be controlled through the level of hydrogen dissolved in \n\nthe liquid metal. Hydrogen gas is highly soluble in liquid aluminum; the higher the \n\ntemperature, the more hydrogen is dissolved in aluminum. During solidification, the amount \n\nof hydrogen dissolved in aluminum in equilibrium certainly diminishes; high cooling speed \n\ncauses hydrogen to saturate in the metal, because the gas does not have enough time to leave \n\nand is thus trapped, giving rise to porosity especially in thicker areas where solidification last \n\noccurs. This porosity, usually oblong and bright, compromises the product mechanical \n\nproperties and sealing, making it unfit for use. \n\nHydrogen contaminates liquid aluminum, especially by adding solid furnace loads \n\ncontaminated with oil and residues from fusion furnaces. These residues, upon \n\ndecomposition, release oxygen (which reacts with aluminum to form oxides), carbon-enrich \n\ngases or fumes, and the hydrogen is immediately incorporated into the liquid metal. \n\nRelative humidity also contributes to aluminum contamination on the surface where \n\noxidation and hydrogen absorption occur; liquid aluminum reacts with air moisture:      \n\n                   . This gaseous hydrogen is partly dissolved into liquid aluminum in \n\natomic form. During solidification, hydrogen becomes less soluble and recombines, is driven \n\nout of the solid phase to the liquid phase, which becomes rich in gas, creating bubbles that get \n\ntrapped in the solid. \n\nMost foundries degasify their baths with great care to minimize gas-related porosity. If \n\ncontrol is not exercised, gas porosity can easily exceed 4% in volume, seriously degrading \n\nmechanical properties of castings. Another type of porosity caused by gas derives from \n\nturbulent feeding, resulting in elongated pores, as stated by Medeiros (1999). \n\nPorosity caused by solidification micro-contractions occurs because aluminum \n\ncontracts and silicon expands during solidification, which is conducive to a theoretical \n\ncontraction of 0 to 2% (instead of 5.6% in the absence of silicon). This generates a lattice of \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\ncavities, which, when cut, form sets of non-spherical holes of variable sizes (Figure 10a, b e \n\nc). \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) \n\n \n(a) (c) \n\nFigure 10: (a) 3D schematic representation of a solidification void and its 2D projection; (b) \n\nand (c) optical micrograph of solidification voids (Anson &amp; Gruzleski, 1999). \n\n \n\nThis type of porosity can be controlled through casting geometry, feeding, and design \n\nof feeding channels and hot tops. This defect is minimized when these factors are properly \n\ndesigned to promote directional solidification. Aluminum castings, when properly designed \n\nand processed, can exhibit low contraction porosity, 0.5% by volume or less. Hetke and \n\nGundlach (1994) claim that pore size and porosity distribution are as important as volume \n\nfraction. Micro-contraction voids occur in the last solidification stage, i.e., at grain boundaries \n\nwhere adjacent grains grow and press against each other. \n\nWhen two grains grow adjacent to one another, the feeding needed to make up for \n\nsolid-liquid contraction is interrupted and micro-contraction voids appear. As a result, the size \n\nof contraction voids is partly determined by grain size; larger grains produce larger \n\ncontraction voids whereas smaller grains produce smaller voids. Figure 11 shows a schematic \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nrepresentation of micro-contraction voids generated at grain boundaries and the influence of \n\ngrain size. \n\n \nFigure 11: Schematic representation of void development by micro-contractions in the \n\nboundaries of grains and the influence of grain size (Hetke &amp; Gundlach, 1994). \n\n \n\nHigh levels of impurity cause the production of inter-metallic phases, which \n\nprecipitate at the grain boundaries, hindering the liquid metal flow and increasing the \n\noccurrence of micro-contractions. Since grain size is directly proportional to cooling rate, \n\nsections first to solidify display finer grain sizes and smaller and more dispersed micro-\n\ncontraction voids. The solidification rate and SDAS influence on strength and ductility of a \n\ncast aluminum alloy (Al-7Si-0.4Mg) is shown in Figure 12 (note that the solidification rate is \n\ninversely proportional to SDAS). These data show that strength and ductility increase \n\nsignificantly as solidification rate. \n\nGrain size can also be reduced by adding inoculants, such as aluminum-titanium-boron \n\nalloys, which increase the number of grains forming during solidification. Grain refinement \n\nobtained through inoculation in aluminum bath is followed by contraction porosity dispersion, \n\nimproving the mechanical properties of casts. \n\nThe main purpose of chemically refining the ? phase is to reduce dendrite size, mainly \n\nby improving feeding conditions and cast mechanical properties and sealing and by reducing \n\nthe tendency to develop hot cracks. In general, refiners hinder the development of columnar \n\ngrains (elongated dendrites) and increase the development of equiaxed grains (less elongated \n\ndendrites). \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 12: Influence of solidification rate and SDAS on mechanical strength and ductility of \n\nan aluminum alloy casting (Al-7Si-0.4Mg) (Campbell, 1991). \n\n \n\n1.3.5 Influence of Impurities \n\n \n\nImpurities contained in these alloys are important in that they modify, with or without \n\nintent, several of the material properties. The main impurities are: \n\n? Iron is a naturally-occurring impurity in silicon and aluminum. It weakens the \n\ncomponent by promoting the development of hard and brittle inter-metallic \n\ncompounds, which may under mechanical stress, facilitate crack nucleation by \n\ndecohesion. In addition, it interferes with feeding of molten metal to parts of the mold \n\nby favoring the development of inter-metallic element platelets and diminishing \n\nsealing of supply channels. In order to display good mechanical properties, iron \n\ncontent must be less than 0.14% in first-melting alloys, said to display high purity; \n\nchromium and manganese have the same effect; \n\n? Zinc, together with manganese, promotes high impact and strain strength and ductility. \n\nA low content improves machinability and a high content promotes high contraction \n\nand hot brittleness; \n\n? Nickel slightly improves dimensional stability and mechanical properties at high \n\ntemperatures, however at a high cost. Above 5%, it favors high contraction; \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n? Lead content above 0.05% neutralizes modification by strontium and decreases \n\nmechanical properties of alloys; \n\n? Tin reduces mechanical properties and increases porosity; \n\n? Phosphor is detrimental to hypo-eutectic alloys, since it constitutes a silicon \n\ngermination site; on the other hand, this element is a refiner for hyper-eutectic alloys \n\n(hyper-silica). In fact, in these alloys, the silicon platelets germinate first and, \n\ntherefore, no aluminum dendrites develop; \n\n? Antimonium neutralizes phosphor, but is not compatible with strontium; \n\n? Lithium, easily oxidized, reacts significantly and quickly in alloys. \n\n \n\nAdditional elements that improve mechanical properties: \n\n? Titanium is a naturally-occurring impurity in aluminum, but it refines dendrites of the \n\naluminum-rich solid solution; hence, it is regarded as a grain refiner; it increases \n\ntensile strength and ductility and decreases thermal conductivity; \n\n? Boron prolongs the effect of titanium in re-melting; like titanium, it acts as a grain \n\nrefiner, increases tensile strength and ductility, and decreases thermal conductivity; \n\n? Sodium and strontium alter the eutectic structure from naturally lamellar to globular, \n\nwhich helps reduce risk of contraction, facilitates machining, and improves geometric \n\nproperties; \n\n? Calcium prolongs modification by sodium. \n\n \n\nAl-Si alloys are the most used in industry because of their melt properties, welding \n\nsuitability, good dimensional stability and low melting point. And more, they present good \n\nresistance to wear, e.g., in periods of engine low lubrication. \n\n \n\n1.4 Defects and Fracture Toughness \n\n \n\nThe quality of castings can be defined by the amount, type, and size of defects in their \n\nmicrostructure. Several papers present studies on the influence of defects on mechanical \n\nproperties of aluminum alloys: C\u00e1ceres et al. (1999); Jiang et al. (1999); Dabayeh et al. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n(1998); C\u00e1ceres and Selling (1996); Dabayeh et al. (1996); Stanzl-Tschegg et al. (1995); \n\nZieser and Sonsino (1993); and Wickberg et al. (1984). Since the matrix fracture toughness is \n\nfixed, the larger the defect, the smaller is the load required to initiate and propagate a crack. \n\nA quality cast displays a structure with minor discontinuities and high fracture \n\ntoughness. With regard to aluminum casts, as indicated by Todinov (1998), certain structural \n\nfeatures, such as micro-contraction voids and non-metallic inclusions, may be regarded as \n\ndiscontinuities. The size and distribution of eutectic silicon phase, inter-metallic phases, and \n\ninclusions contribute to determining the value of fracture toughness. Therefore, higher \n\nstrength and ductility values are obtained when: \n\n1. Eutectic silicon modification is large; \n\n2. Contraction voids are small and few; \n\n3. Oxides are removed; \n\n4. Impurities are minimized; \n\n5. Microstructure exhibits minor dendrite arm spacing. \n\n \n\n1.5 Solidification Rate and SDAS \n\n \n\nHigh solidification rates produce important benefits that result in substantial \n\nimprovement of mechanical properties of casts. Rapid solidification reduces grain size and \n\nrefines and disperses porosity by contraction. It also improves eutectic silicon modification, \n\nresulting in more finely divided silicon particles. These refined silicon phases are more \n\nsusceptible to further modification and agglomeration during heat treatment. Moreover, high \n\nsolidification rates reduce the amount of segregation in the alloy. A decrease in solidification \n\ndistances diminishes the degree of solute redistribution in dendrites and at grain boundaries. \n\nAs a result, development of insoluble impurities is reduced and the size and volume of inter-\n\nmetallic phases are minimized, increasing toughness. The amount of Sr needed to modify \n\neutectic silicon is also minimized. \n\nKuma (1996) sustains that processes with a high solidification rate result in casts with \n\nbetter mechanical properties and fatigue strength. Secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) is \n\nthe most direct measure of the solidification rate in a cast. Due to this factor, several studies \n\nhave shown correlations between SDAS and mechanical properties of aluminum-silicon \n\nalloys, e.g., Doglione et al. (1996), Bamberg et al. (1986), and Oswalt and Misra (1981). \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nFigure 13 shows a correlation between SDAS, grain size, and local solidification time for the \n\nAl-4,5Cu alloy. It has become usual to specify the SDAS in critical areas of aluminum casts \n\nto ensure that the mechanical properties specified in the project are achieved. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 13: Correlation between SDAS, grain size, and local solidification time for the Al-\n\n4,5Cu alloy (CAMPBELL, 1991). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n1.6 Brief of Chapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n- Al-Si alloys are the most used in industry because of their melt properties, welding \n\nsuitability, good dimensional stability and low melting point. \n\n- Aluminum-Silicon 300 Series are the aluminum alloys that display the best casting \n\ncharacteristics. \n\n- The quality of castings can be defined by the amount, type, and size of defects in \n\ntheir microstructure. \n\n- Porosity in aluminum alloys is responsible for decrease in mechanical strength and \n\noccurrence of cracks and thus constitutes an important problem. Two varieties of micro-\n\nporosity can occur in aluminum castings: porosity resulting from gas (hydrogen) and porosity \n\nderiving from micro-contraction due to solidification. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2: TEMPERATURE EFFECTS \n\n \n\n2.1 Effect of High Temperature on Materials \n\n \n\nParts subjected to high temperatures display numerous problems, such as creep, \n\noxidation (or corrosion), and fatigue. These damage mechanisms can act independently or in \n\nconcert (which renders the study of damage at high temperatures more complex), according to \n\nmaterial variables and operating conditions, such as maximum and minimum temperature, \n\ntemperature range, mechanical strain range, strain rate (in-phase or out-of-phase) or \n\nenvironmental factors (Cai, 1999). Conform to Engler-Pinto Jr. (1995), the damage caused by \n\nthese factors is in the inception of nucleation of cracks that propagate and cause fatigue \n\nfailure. However, as temperature rises well above room temperature, creep becomes important \n\nand is the main cause of fracture at still higher temperatures (temperatures above half the \n\nmelting point). \n\nA high temperature for one material may not be considered high for another, then, it is \n\nusually expressed as homologous temperature, i.e., the ratio between the test temperature and \n\nmelting temperature of the metal in question, both in absolute scale (Kelvin). According to \n\nDieter (1981), as a rule, flow reaches significance in engineering at homologous temperatures \n\nhigher than 0.5. \n\nIn general, mechanical strength of metals decreases as temperature increases above \n\nroom temperature (Figure 14). This is mainly due to increased mobility of atoms as \n\ntemperature rises. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 14: Influence of temperature on fatigue limit for different alloys (Fuchs, 2001). \n\n \n\nTherefore, diffusion-controlled processes have a very significant impact on \n\nmechanical properties at high temperatures. High temperatures also result in greater mobility \n\nof dislocations due to the scaling mechanism, which becomes important because of higher \n\ndissemination and also because the concentration of gaps in equilibrium increases with \n\nincreasing temperature. In addition, new strain mechanisms may become operative. In some \n\nmetals, the sliding system changes or additional sliding systems are introduced. \n\nStrain at grain boundaries becomes an additional possibility in strain of metals at high \n\ntemperatures. Another important factor to consider is the effect of prolonged exposure of \n\nmetals and alloys to high temperatures on their metallurgical stability. Cold-worked metals \n\ncan re-crystallize and undergo grain growth whereas age-hardened alloys may undergo over-\n\naging and lose strength as second-phase particles grow. The metal-environment interaction, \n\ni.e., oxidation, is also an important factor to be taken into account (Dieter, 1981). \n\nIt is also important that mechanical properties at high temperatures should always be \n\nconsidered in relation to a time scale. The mechanical properties at room temperature of most \n\nengineering metals are not, for practical purposes, time-dependent. However, at high \n\ntemperatures, strength becomes very dependent on both strain rate and exposure time. Under \n\nthese conditions, many metals behave, in many respects, as visco-plastic materials. \n\nCreep or crack growth can occur when materials are subjected to constant stress, \n\nwhich causes their strain response to change. A metal subjected to constant tractive loading \n\nand high temperatures flows and undergos an increase in length that depends on time. Under \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nconstant strain conditions, relaxation can occur, changing the strain exerted on the material. \n\nThis time-dependence of mechanical properties at elevated temperatures differs for each \n\nmaterial and is related to the temperature to which the material is exposed (Fuchs, 1980). \n\nTherefore, some important factors to be taken into account when materials are undergoing \n\nfatigue at high temperatures are discussed in the following section. \n\n \n\n2.2 Creep-Fatigue Interaction \n\n \n\nComponents that are in a permanent state of cyclic loading at high temperatures may \n\nbe subjected to creep-fatigue interaction, since they can be damaged by micro-structural \n\ncreep. Therefore, resistance to low-cycle fatigue and mastery of the creep-fatigue interaction \n\nprocess are important criteria in the development of components that will operate under limit \n\nconditions. Therefore, it is necessary to understand cyclic strain and fracture behavior in \n\nmaterials at various loading rates and high temperatures (Srinivasan, 2003). \n\nCreep is the strain occurring in solid materials over time when they are subjected to \n\nconstant loading at high temperatures, which may eventually lead to fracture. Although this \n\nstrain can occur at all temperatures, it is only significant when it occurs at temperatures \n\ncorresponding to 30% of the melting point for pure metals and 40% for metal alloys (Dry, \n\n2001; Es-Soun, 2001a, Langdon, 2002). \n\nTransition from fatigue failure to creep failure with increasing temperature almost \n\nalways changes fracture type from trans-granular, typical of fatigue failure, to inter-granular, \n\ncharacteristic of creep failure (Fuchs, 2001). Local oxidation of grain boundaries can \n\nsignificantly contribute to crack initiation. Dieter (1981) sustains that the amount of creep \n\nincreases with average strain at all temperatures. Ferrous materials, which usually have a \n\npronounced fatigue limit in tests at room temperature, display the same performance when \n\ntested at temperatures above about 420\u00b0C. Fatigue tests at high temperatures also depend on \n\nhow often strain is applied. It is common to refer to the total time required to fracture in the \n\nsame way as to the number of cycles. \n\nIn general, the higher the material creep resistance, the greater is its fatigue strength at \n\nhigh temperatures. However, the metallurgical treatment that produces better fatigue \n\nproperties at high temperatures does not necessarily result in better creep properties. This was \n\nshown by Toolin and Mochell in Dieter (1981) for several alloys in tests at high temperatures. \n\nAt low temperatures, the smaller the metal grain size, the better is its performance under \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nfatigue. As test temperature is increased, the difference between the performance of a fine-\n\ngrained material under fatigue and that of a coarse material decreases up to very high \n\ntemperatures, at which flow dominates. Then, the material with larger grain size displays \n\nhigher resistance. Typically, alloys mechanically worked beforehand have somewhat higher \n\nfatigue strength, while cast materials are often more resistant to creep. The solutions that \n\nsucceed in reducing fatigue failure at room temperature may not be effective at high \n\ntemperatures. Compressive residual stresses, for example, can be alleviated before the \n\ncomponent operating temperature is reached. \n\nNucleation of fatigue cracks is basically a surface phenomenon. In contrast, creep \n\ndamage is manifested both on the surface and inside the material. Thus, creep can influence \n\nboth crack initiation and growth (Sarabanda, 1991). Wareing (1983) states that creep damage \n\nis manifested by cavity nucleation at grain boundaries due to cavity coalescence, dislocation \n\nstacking, and grain boundary sliding. \n\nThe same may happen to second-phase particles. The subsequent growth of these \n\ncavities leads to grain boundary cracking and inter-granular fracture. Under static loading, \n\nfailure is established by catastrophic fracture; that is when cavities coalesce. In low-cycle \n\nfatigue with overlapping loading levels at high temperatures, fracture occurs when cavities \n\nachieve a critical geometric configuration. \n\nCreep damage may derive from tensile residual stress caused by strain under \n\ncompression followed by its reversion. In both cases, inelastic deformation takes place under \n\nzero total strain, though with differing signs of residual stress. Other loadings involving \n\ninelastic deformation, found in components subjected to thermal fatigue, may be simulated in \n\nmechanical tests (Wareing, 1983; Skelton, 1983; Hales, 1983). The dwell time at certain \n\nlevels of stress or strain is another independent variable, ranging from seconds to hours. \n\nDwell under tensile load are generally more damaging than those under compression \n\nwhen applied separately. The application of retention under traction load and, shortly \n\nafterward, a dwell under compression load appears to produce less damage than applying the \n\nformer in isolation. Wareing (1983) claims that this is due to a healing effect, that take place \n\nin the compressive part of loading cycle, on the cavities formed during the tensile part of the \n\ndwell cycle. This is a complex phenomenon and requires the knowledge of the mechanism of \n\nmicro-structural creep damage. However, some side effects to elastic energy becoming \n\ninelastic deformation may be found even in the absence of micro-structural damage. The most \n\nimportant effect is the variation of the mean stress caused by the inelastic deformation, mainly \n\nfor materials with high creep strength. For completely reverse cycles, a dwell in the tensile \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nhalf-cycle leads to a compressive mean stress; in the case of a dwell in the compressive part of \n\nthe cycle, the mean stress changes in the tensile direction. In the latter, life time under fatigue \n\nis reduced as a result of higher tensile stress and not quite because of inelastic deformation \n\n(ASM, 1985). \n\nAnother phenomenon occurring in materials is creep relaxation. Stress relaxation \n\nusually occurs in parts joined by screws (flanges) and hot-set assemblages. When these \n\ncomponents are in operation at high temperatures, their joints can become loose and produce \n\ndisconnection between their parts due to excessive screw stretching and/or flange rotation. \n\nRelaxation consists of reducing applied load (stress) over time at constant strain. \n\nStrain constancy is obtained by reducing load or stress over time or by stopping the \n\nmovement of the engine heads, considering load in relation to time at a fixed position of the \n\nheads. As temperature is usually high, these cases produce creep conditions. The total strain \n\n( ) is equal to the sum of elastic deformation (  ) and plastic deformation or creep rate (  ). \n\nFor the strain ? to remain constant, elastic deformation has to decrease with time and plastic \n\ndeformation has to grow proportionately, and, as a result, the stress required to have a \n\nconstant ? should decrease with increasing creep. The increase in    is equal to or smaller than \n\nthe increase in    (Souza, 1982). \n\n \n\n2.3 Damage and Crack Initiation at High Temperatures \n\n \n\nNucleation of fatigue cracks in alloys at high temperatures is influenced by several \n\ntemperature-dependent microscopic processes at both the strain level and the environment \n\nlevel. Mechanisms accountable for fatigue crack initiation may be usually grouped into the \n\nfollowing categories: (a) cyclic sliding-induced cracking; (b) creep-related grain boundary \n\ncavitation; (c) grain boundary sliding and wedge crack development; (d) void nucleation and \n\ngrowth from inclusions and precipitates; and (e) oxidation and corrosion. \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Cyclic Sliding \n\n \n\nCyclic sliding is affected by temperature. The following points illustrate the role \n\nplayed by temperature in this phenomenon. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n1. At temperatures higher than half the homologous temperature, most materials begin to \n\nexhibit alternated sliding characteristics. In alloys with solid solution, stacking failure \n\nenergy generally increases with increasing temperature. Thermal activation also \n\nenables displacement movement of by cross slipping and climbing. \n\n2. Kinematic irreversibility of cyclic sliding is increased by oxidation and/or gas \n\ndiffusion at high temperatures. \n\n3. Alternate sliding may be counteracted in some materials by dynamic strain aging that \n\nfavors planar sliding. \n\n4. Displacement movement by climbing is time-dependent, which makes strain at high \n\ntemperatures sensitive to strain rate. \n\n5. For most engineering materials, micro-structural stability decreases at higher \n\ntemperatures. Thermally activated micro-structural changes may arise as a result of \n\naging by strain, recovery, or precipitation. These micro-structural changes can be \n\nbeneficial or harmful to fatigue strength; they can also modify significantly cyclic \n\nstress-strain characteristics. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Creep Cavitation \n\n \n\nAccording to Suresh (1998), at temperatures between one and two thirds the melting \n\npoint and at low stress, most metals, alloys, and ceramics exhibit creep by cavitation at grain \n\nboundaries. These cavities nucleate at triple points of grain boundaries, in grain boundary \n\nparticles, or protrusions in intergranular facets. In many engineering alloys, creep cavities \n\nnucleate well below the 100 MPa nominal stress, and their nucleation occurs continuously \n\nover a substantial fraction of creep life (Riedel, 1987). Shear slipping of grain boundary faces \n\nalso favors cavity nucleation. \n\nA particularly interesting aspect of creep cavitation under cyclic loading is that the \n\ndegree of cavitation is strongly influenced by stress waveform. Slow creep rates under \n\ntraction and fast rates under compression, i.e., waveforms with long periods of tensile stress, \n\nexhibit greater propensity for cavitation than balanced loading cycles in which the magnitude \n\nof part of the traction loading varies identically to the compression phase, as shown in Figure \n\n15 (Majumdar, 1980; Baik, 1982). \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nReidel (1987) took into account different creep cavitation theories for slow and fast \n\nfatigue loading and presented a map of mechanisms for life under fatigue in relation to \n\ntemperature for fixed values of deformation variation (  ) and test frequency. \n\n \nFigure 15: (a) Balanced, slow-fast, and fast-slow fatigue loading; (b) map of mechanisms of \n\nlife under fatigue in relation to temperature (for fixed values of non-linear variation of strain \n\nand frequency) for fast-slow loading in fatigue-creep (Reidel, 1987). \n\n \n\nAt intermediate temperatures represented by region C, cavity growth occurs by \n\ndiffusion, in which cavities nucleate continuously throughout the creep-fatigue test. For low \n\nvalues of accumulated strain (       ), the effect of frequency (  ) and temperature ( ) in \n\nregion C are described by the relationship (                \n   \n\n), in which    is the diffusion \n\ncoefficient of the grain boundary. For larger values of    (Regime B), the accumulated strain \n\nis so large that the density of cavities saturates early in fatigue life; in this case, \n\n              . For low temperatures (Region A), the plastic growth of cavities is postulated \n\nas the dominant mechanism. This process does not depend on frequency if the development of \n\nsurface cavities is irreversible. \n\nFor higher temperatures (Region D), cavities grow so fast that the applied strain rate\u2014\n\nassumed to be constant in Figure 15b\u2014may not be capable of accommodating the cavity \n\nvolume for a long time. As a result, cavity growth is hindered in the slow-fast loading mode. \n\nFor even higher temperatures (Region E), the growth of restrained cavities takes place in the \n\nfast compression segment. Since diffusion rates are high at these temperatures, cavity growth \n\nis restrained under both traction and compression. This is conducive to zero cavity growth \n\nthereby improving life under fatigue. \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Grain Boundary Sliding \n\n \n\nMany experimental studies (e.g., Driver, 1971; Min &amp; Raj, 1979) showed that grain \n\nboundary sliding plays an important role in nucleation of inter-granular cavities in creep \n\nfatigue. This process is also a mechanistic consideration in empirical partitioning of inelastic \n\ndeformation variation when estimating creep-fatigue life. On the assumption that grain \n\nboundary sliding is the rate-limiting step in crack nucleation at triple junctions and that it does \n\nnot occur above a critical strain rate value (    ), Min and Raj (1979) developed the following \n\nmodel (Equation 3): \n\n     \n            \n\n            \n \n\n (3) \n\nwhere    is the material yield stress,    is the atomic volume,   is Boltzmann\u2019s constant,   is \n\nabsolute temperature (K),    is the grain size,    is the fraction by volume of cavity-\n\nnucleating particles at the grain boundary, and    is the average particle size. The remaining \n\nterms are defined in the following section. \n\nAccording to this theory, if the waveform is such that strain rates in stress and \n\ncompression are below a critical value, no net harm is produced as long as grain boundary \n\nsliding occurs equally in the direction of advance and reverse loading. When fast and slow \n\nloading and strain rate, during compression, is greater than     , maximum damage is \n\nproduced. Although this model is a simplification of the grain sliding process, it provides \n\nunderstanding of how waveform affects fatigue at high temperatures in many alloys. \n\nGrain boundary cavitation can be affected by relative temperature and stress variations \n\nwith time. Experiments of Fujino and Taira (1980) on AISI 304 stainless steel showed that \n\ncyclic in-phase temperature and stress variations produce greater damage in fatigue than off-\n\nphase thermo-mechanical loading. In addition, off-phase loading produces shorter fatigue life \n\nthan isothermal mechanical fatigue. This variation of fatigue strength for different thermo-\n\nmechanical loading conditions seems to imply a correlation with amount of grain boundary \n\nsliding. \n\nSub-surface fatigue crack nucleation can occur at high temperatures by decohesion of \n\ninclusions and second-phase particles from the matrix. In some aluminum alloys, void \n\nnucleation around precipitates at the grain boundary causes cavitation even at low \n\ntemperatures (Vasudevan, 1987). Furthermore, an increase in precipitation during the fatigue \n\nprocess at high temperatures produces a large number of void nucleation sites. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Oxidation and Corrosion \n\n \n\nThe presence of an oxidizing or aggressive environment may have an influence on \n\nmechanisms of crack nucleation by fatigue at high temperatures as follows: \n\n1. By preventing cavity closure or sintering at high temperatures; \n\n2. Under the influence of applied stress, cavities develop around precipitates at grain \n\nboundaries (Wells, 1979). Moreover, precipitation of residual gases can provide nuclei \n\nfor cavities, with internal gas pressure accelerating cavity growth. If grains near the \n\nsurface are not protected by an oxide layer, oxygen or other embrittling element may \n\nspread at grain boundaries and react with existing precipitates. \n\n3. The combination of surface diffusion and oxidation during sliding promotes kinematic \n\nincreases in cyclic sliding, which results in nucleation of fatigue cracks (Figure 16). \n\nThis process is known as Fujita\u2019s mechanism (Fujita, 1963). \n\n4. Preferential oxidation at some micro-structural sites, e.g., the intersection of grain \n\nboundaries and free surfaces, gives rise to microscopic stress concentrators (notches). \n\nThese micro-notches increase local stress and promote crack nucleation (Duquette, \n\n1979). \n\n5. Repeated loading breaks through the protecting oxide film on the material surface. The \n\nlack of this film provides an active path for chemical attack. Furthermore, cracking of \n\nthe fragile oxide film per se can promote growth of catastrophic fatigue cracks (Wells, \n\n1979). \n\nFor many materials, deterioration of fatigue strength at elevated temperatures is merely a \n\nresult of interactions with the environment. The experimental basis for this inference may be \n\nfound in Coffin (1973) for AISI A286 ferrous alloy (Figure 17). \n\nHere the variation of plastic deformation (   ) with the number of cycles to fail (  ) is not \n\naffected by temperature or frequency in vacuum. However, when testing frequency is \n\nlowered, low-cycle fatigue life is severely reduced at elevated temperatures in air. \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 16: Illustration of Fujita\u2019s mechanism for fatigue crack nucleation (Suresh, 1998). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 17: Variation of plastic deformation in relation to life of AISI A289 alloys in air and \n\nvacuum with frequency and temperature variation (Coffin, 1973). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n2.4 Brief of Chapter 2 \n\n \n\n- An important factor to consider is the effect of prolonged exposure of metals and \n\nalloys to high temperatures on their metallurgical stability. \n\n- It is also important that mechanical properties at high temperatures should always be \n\nconsidered in relation to a time scale. \n\n- A metal subjected to constant tractive loading and high temperatures flows and \n\nundergos an increase in length that depends on time.

Metallic materials, when \n\nsubjected to repetitive or fluctuating stress, i.e., when under cyclic stresses, break up at stress \n\nlevels well below those predicted by stress and strain tests. Failure occurring under these \n\ndynamic conditions of stress application is known as fatigue failure. This phenomenon takes \n\nplace within a considerable time after the material has been subjected to stresses. As \n\ntechnology develops, as required by industry (e.g., aviation and automotive), and incorporates \n\nnew components and equipment that are continuously subjected to dynamic forces and \n\nvibration, fatigue has become the cause of over 90% of failure of metallic components in \n\noperation. Fatigue failure is rather unpredictable, because it happens without notice. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nAround 1871, German engineer A. W\u00f6hler conducted the first systematic investigation \n\nof fatigue behavior of rail axes. He conducted fatigue tests with real-size models as well as \n\nsmall specimens subjected to cyclic bending, torsion and stress-compression, using various \n\ntypes of materials. Results were recorded in terms of conventional stress ( ) in relation to the \n\nlogarithm of the number of cycles ( ), which became known as ?-N curves or W\u00f6hler curves. \n\nA     curve is usually determined using certain quantities of specimens according to \n\nrecommendations found in ASTM E466 (1996), ASTM E468, and ASTM E739 (1991). It is \n\nrecommended, among other things, a minimum quantity of specimens be used for each stress \n\nlevel tested, which is determined by the accuracy degree required of the test. \n\nThe stress-life (   ) method was the first methodology employed in an attempt to \n\nunderstand and quantify fatigue of metals. This methodology is extensively used in design \n\napplications where applied stress is predominantly within the elastic regime of the material \n\nand the resulting life (cycles to fail) is long, stress and strain being linearly related, known as \n\nhigh-cycle fatigue. Therefore, in this period, the results of tests under controlled load or strain \n\nare equivalent, but     curves are generated by testing under controlled load. However, the \n\nstress-life method does not suit low-cycle applications, in which applied strains have a \n\nsignificant plastic component. In this case, a strain-based approach is more appropriate \n\n(Bannantine, 1990). \n\n \n\n3.2 Low-Cycle fatigue \n\n \n\nIn the strain-based approach there is low-cycle fatigue related to operational \n\nconditions in which failures occur at relatively high stresses and low numbers of cycles to \n\nfailure (less than    ). The conditions for low-cycle fatigue to occur often arise when \n\nrepeated stresses are of thermal origin. Because thermal stresses are due to the material \n\nthermal contraction or expansion, fatigue results from cyclic strain instead of cyclic stress. \n\nAlso, according to Suresh (1998), information from cyclic stress analyses based on \n\ncontinuum mechanics is primarily related to elastic deformation without mechanical \n\nrestriction. In many practical applications, engineering components are often subjected to \n\nsome degree of structural restriction and localized plastic deformation, particularly in areas of \n\nstress concentration. This type of problem should be taken into account when designing \n\npressure vessels for nuclear industry, steam turbine components, aircraft engines, and many \n\nother types of equipment and machines, e.g., brake discs (Dieter, 1981). \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nLow-cycle fatigue tests are carried out under controlled strain and results are plotted in \n\ngraphs as strain logarithm in relation to the logarithm of number of reversals (   ). \n\nCoffin and Manson, cited in Suresh (1998), worked independently on thermal fatigue \n\nproblems and proposed the characterization of life under fatigue based on the extent of plastic \n\ndeformation. They observed a linear relationship (Equation 4) between the logarithm of \n\nplastic deformation amplitude and the logarithm of the number of reverse to failure in metallic \n\nmaterials. \n\n   \n\n \n   \n\n       (4) \n\nwhere   \n  is the fatigue ductility coefficient and   the fatigue ductility exponent. In general   \n\n  \n\nis approximately equal to the true ductility coefficient (  ) in traction and   ranges from -0.5 \n\nto -0.7 for most metals. \n\nIn bi-logarithmic scale, Equation 4 may be expressed as a straight line, as shown in \n\nFigure 18. The total strain amplitude of a test with constant strain amplitude may be described \n\nas the sum of elastic and plastic deformation amplitudes, as shown by Equation 5: \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n\n \n   \n\n \n (5) \n\n \nFigure 18: Plastic strain amplitude in relation to number of reverses, bi-logarithmic scale \n\n(Dieter, 1981). \n\n \n\nBy using Equation 6 of Basquin (cited in Suresh, 1998) to relate the stress amplitude (Figure \n\n19): \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n  \n\n \n   \n\n       (6) \n\nwhere   \n  is the fatigue strength coefficient and      corresponds to stress amplitude (  ). \n\nThe fatigue strength coefficient (  \n ) and the fatigue strength exponent (b) are fatigue \n\nproperties of materials. Values of   range from -0.05 to -0.12, and for many metals   \n  is \n\napproximately equal to the actual strain at fracture, determined by stress tests. \n\n \nFigure 19: Actual stress in relation to number of reverses, in bi-logarithmic scale (Dieter, \n\n1981). \n\n \n\nNoting Equation 7: \n\n   \n \n\n \n  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n     \n\n \n (7) \n\nwhere   is Young\u2019s modulus. \n\nIt is possible to rewrite Equation 5 as indicated in Equation 8: \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n        \n\n       (8) \n\nThe total, plastic and elastic strain amplitudes are shown in Figure 20 in relation to the \n\nnumber of reverses to failure (  ). It is possible to define a transition between low and high-\n\ncycle fatigue at the point where elastic and plastic deformation amplitudes are the same (   ). \n\nAccording to Suresh (1998), plastic deformation predominates over elastic deformation and \n\nfatigue strength is controlled by the material ductility for low-cycle fatigue         . As \n\nfor high-cycle fatigue         , elastic deformation is more significant than plastic \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\ndeformation and life is controlled by the material strength. Optimization of fatigue properties \n\nis conducive to a balance between strength and ductility of the material. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 20: Total strain amplitude in relation to number of reverses to failure, obtained from \n\nthe superposition of elastic and plastic deformation in relation to number of reverses to failure \n\n(Fuchs, 2001). \n\n \n\nLow-cycle fatigue tests are usually conducted under controlled strain. Figure 21 show \n\nan ideal stress-strain loop resulting from a low-cycle fatigue test in which cyclic strain is kept \n\nconstant. \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 21: Ideal strain-stress hysteresis loop resulting from a low-cycle fatigue test under \n\nconstant cyclic strain (Thomas, 1987). \n\n \n\nDuring loading and unloading, a hysteresis loop originates, whose dimensions are \n\ndescribed as width (  ), total strain period, and height (  ), which is the period between \n\nstresses. The total strain period (  ) comprises an elastic deformation component (    \n\n    ) and a plastic deformation component (   ). The hysteresis loop width depends on the \n\ncyclic strain level; at low levels, hysteresis loops become very narrow. \n\nFor tests performed under constant   , the stress period (  ) usually varies with the \n\nincrease in the number of cycles. Annealed materials undergo cyclic hardening, which means \n\nthat    increases with the number of cycles until it saturates after about 100 strain cycles. The \n\nlarger the value of   , the greater is the increase in the stress period. Materials that have \n\npreviously undergone cold work experience cyclic softening, i.e.,    decreases with \n\nincreasing number of strain cycles. Therefore, the usual way of presenting results of low-cycle \n\nfatigue tests is by plotting the strain amplitude (    ) as a function of the number of reversals \n\nto fail (   ). \n\nLow-cycle fatigue is usually referred to as low-cycle isothermal fatigue, low-cycle \n\nthermal fatigue, or low-cycle thermo-mechanical fatigue. Low-cycle fatigue may be \n\ncharacterized as: (1) high-strain cycling when the range of inelastic deformation in the cycle \n\nexceeds that of elastic deformation; and (2) inelastic deformations of such magnitude that they \n\nspread through the microstructure evenly. Fatigue damage at high temperatures originates as a \n\nresult of inelastic deformations when irrecoverable. In the case of low cycles, the material is \n\ndamaged after a small number of cycles. Thermo-mechanical fatigue usually derives from \n\nlow-cycle fatigue, e.g., in jet engines the highest thermal transients and gradients occur during \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nengine startup/shutdown. The total number of take-offs and landings during an aircraft life is \n\nbelow 30,000 cycles. In this case, laboratory investigations are carried out under low-cycle \n\nconditions and may be completed in a short period of time. \n\n \n\n3.3 Isothermal Fatigue \n\n \n\nAn isothermal fatigue test consists of imposing varying mechanical strains at constant \n\ntemperature. This type of test has been widely used since the 1970s upon the advent of test \n\nequipment that operates in closed loop. Its main advantages are easy conduction and low cost \n\nas compared to an anisothermal test; results for several materials may be found in the \n\nliterature (Coffin Jr., 1954). \n\nStudies conducted by several researchers have shown that isothermal fatigue life is \n\nlonger than that of anisothermal fatigue (Hertnarski, 1991; Shi, 1998). This may be attested \n\nby the study carried out by Shi et al. (cited in Shi, 1998), shown in Figure 22, with a \n\nmolybdenum alloy containing 0.5% Ti, 0.08% Zr, and 0.01-0.04% carbon. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 22: Isothermal and thermo-mechanical fatigue curves (Shi, 1998). \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nLife obtained by isothermal fatigue tests for two temperature levels (350\u00b0C and \n\n500\u00b0C) was longer, in both cases, than that found in in-phase thermo-mechanical fatigue at \n\ntemperatures ranging from 350\u00b0C to 500\u00b0C, which points that temperature variation causes \n\ngreat damage to material. However, for the two types of isothermal tests under analysis, no \n\nclear difference was observed for number of cycles to specimen failure, which shows that the \n\nmaterial displays good strength within this temperature range. Then, designs based solely on \n\nisothermal fatigue results of components that operate at high temperatures are not reliable. It \n\nis important to conduct an in-depth investigation into behavior of materials subjected to this \n\nphenomenon, including tests using different temperature ranges (anisothermal fatigue) and \n\nunder varying stress and strain conditions. \n\nFigure 23 shows that the longest life under isothermal fatigue occurs within an applied \n\nintermediate temperature range. Within this range the shortest life for 316L (N) austenitic \n\nstainless steel under isothermal fatigue occurred at room temperature (25\u00b0C), where strain \n\ninduced the development of martensite. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 23: Effect of temperature on fatigue life (Srinivasan, 2003). \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, at 573K (300\u00b0C) the material underwent sub-structural recovery, \n\nwhich was responsible for increased life. \n\nHowever, a sub-structural recovery of the material occurred at 573K (300\u00b0C), which \n\nwas responsible for increase in life. The reduction in life as temperature continued to rise may \n\nbe attributed to several effects of dynamic strain, e.g., stress concentration induced by pilling \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nup of dislocations when the maximum stress of the cycle is reached, causing an increased \n\ncrack growth rate. This may be clearly seen at temperatures higher than 873K (600\u00b0C), at \n\nwhich life was significantly reduced by oxidation (Srinivasan, 2003). \n\nAnother aspect to be noted about isothermal fatigue with controlled strain is the \n\nbehavior of cyclic stress in relation to life. For 316L(N) austenitic stainless steel, behavior \n\nwas monitored in four stages, as shown in Figure 24 (Srinivasan, 2003). \n\n \nFigure 24: Cyclic stress response in relation to temperature (Srinivasan, 2003). \n\n \n\nThe alloy exhibited a short period of cyclic hardening, reaching the maximum stress in \n\nthe first life stage. Then, it may be observed that cyclic softening takes place before stable \n\nregime is achieved. In the period prior to fracture, stress amplitude decreases rapidly, \n\nindicating the development of a macro-crack and its subsequent spread. The same figure \n\nindicates that the amplitude of the stress peak increases with increasing temperature between \n\n573K and 873K (Srinivasan, 2003). Also, it shows that some factors contribute to the drop in \n\nmaterial strength as temperature increases: (a) abnormal cyclic hardening rate and reduced \n\nplastic deformation amplitude in the intermediate life to fracture; and (b) increased maximum \n\nstress rate during the initial stages with increasing temperature due to inductive interaction \n\ndeveloped between diffusion solutes and discrepancy mobility under strain. All these \n\nphenomena are considered to be a manifestation of dynamic strain processes. \n\nA more detailed discussion comparing isothermal and anisothermal fatigue can be found \n\nbelow. \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n3.4 In-Phase and Out-of-Phase Thermomechanical Fatigue and Thermal Fatigue \n\n \n\nSeveral components are subjected to a variety of thermal and thermo-mechanical loads \n\ndue to temperature variations during operation. The conditions of cyclic loading induced by \n\ntemperature gradient are essentially strain-constrained loads. Then, laboratory studies on \n\nthermal fatigue are usually constrained by strain control in low-cycle fatigue tests (Hetnarski, \n\n1991). Research on mechanical behavior and fracture mechanisms of these materials is \n\nimportant to improve design and use of these components. \n\nIf stress develops under thermal cycling without external loading in a component, the \n\nterm thermal fatigue (TF) is employed. This process may result from steep temperature \n\ngradients in a component, or through a section, and may occur in a perfectly homogeneous \n\nand isotropic material. For example, when heated, a surface is compressed by the cooler \n\nmaterial below the surface. Thus, the surface is subjected to compressive stresses. Under \n\ncooling, strain is in the opposite direction, and tensile stresses may develop. Under heating \n\nand cooling cycles, the surface can be damaged by TF. Classic TF examples may be found in \n\ntrain wheels subjected to the action of brake shoes, which generates temperature gradients \n\nand, consequently, internal stresses (Sehitoglu, 1996). \n\nOn the other hand, TF may develop in laboratory specimens, even under uniform \n\ntemperature conditions, because of internal constraints, such as orientation of different grains \n\nat a microscopic level or anisotropy of the thermal expansion coefficient of some crystals (not \n\ncubic). Strains and internal stresses may be big enough to cause expansion, distortion and \n\nsurface irregularities in the material. Consequently, thermal loops lead to micro-structural \n\ndamage and deterioration. This behavior has been observed in pure metals such as uranium, \n\ntin, cadmium-based alloys, and duplex steels whose microstructure consists of ferrite and \n\nmartensite. \n\nThe term thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) describes fatigue under variation of both \n\ntemperature and mechanical strain. Mechanical strain is determined by subtracting thermal \n\nstrain from total strain, which should be uniform throughout the specimen. Mechanical strain \n\nderives from external constraints or externally applied loads. For example, if a specimen is \n\nheld between two rigid walls and subjected to thermal cycling (without allowing for \n\nexpansion), it will undergo \"external\" compressive mechanical strain. TMF examples can be \n\nfound in pressure vessels and pipelines in the power generation industry, where structures are \n\nsubjected to pressure loads and thermal transients with temperature gradients in the thickness \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\ndirection, and the aircraft industry, where turbine blades and disks are subjected to \n\ntemperature gradients aggravated by rotation-related stress. \n\nAccording to Sehitoglu (1996), thermo-mechanical fatigue may involve several \n\nmechanisms that add damage to that of \"pure\" fatigue, including creep and oxidation at \n\nelevated temperatures, which directly contribute to further damage. These mechanisms differ \n\nfrom each another, depending on strain and temperature history. They are different from those \n\npredicted by fluidity tests (no reversals) and by oxidation tests without stress (or with constant \n\nstress). Micro-structural degradation may occur under TMF as: (1) over-aging, such as \n\ncoalescing of lamellae and precipitates; (2) strain aging for systems hardened by solid \n\nsolution; (3) precipitation of second-phase particles; and (4) phase transformation at the cycle \n\nlimit temperature. Variations in mechanical properties or in the thermal expansion coefficient \n\nbetween the matrix and precipitates\u2014found in many alloys\u2014also cause local stresses and \n\ncracks. These mechanisms affect the strain characteristics of the material, which are \n\ninexorably associated with damage processes. \n\nFor this reason, more advanced test techniques at varied temperatures were developed, \n\nsuch as the thermal fatigue (TF) test and thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) test, whose main \n\ndifferences are shown schematically in Figure 25 (Meyer-Olbersleben, 1995; Engler Pinto, Jr., \n\n1994). \n\nA TF test involves subjecting a specimen with geometry similar to that of the \n\ncomponent under study to alternating heating and cooling cycles. Stresses of internal origin \n\nderive from the specimen geometry, warming and cooling rates, and material properties. It is a \n\nmore technological test; its results enable immediate design application as it is capable of \n\ndetermining the life of a specimen with geometry similar to that of the component studied and \n\ncan be used to reliably compare different types of materials. On the other hand, it has the \n\ndisadvantage of not allowing direct strain and stress measurements, which have to be \n\ncalculated, for instance, by means of the finite element method. To do so, according to Mallet \n\net al. (1995), it is necessary to use a mathematical model to express the material mechanical \n\nbehavior. \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 25: Comparison between thermal fatigue tests and thermo-mechanical tests (Engler-\n\nPinto Jr., 1996). Todos os par\u00e2metros mec\u00e2nicos medidos durante o ensaio \n\n \n\nThe TMF test, however, is characterized by independent and simultaneous overlapping \n\nof a strain cycle in relation to time (    ) and a temperature vs. time cycle (    ) in \n\naccordance with a previously established thermo-mechanical history. The external strain \n\nimposed by an especially-adapted and computerized testing machine replaces the internal \n\nstrain of the TF test. The test is uniaxial and should be performed at low frequencies in order \n\nto avoid temperature gradients throughout the specimen. Despite its complexity and high cost, \n\nthis test is more scientific in that the researcher can control all the influential parameters. It is \n\nuseful to determine the mechanical behavior of materials under anisothermal conditions \n\n(closer to reality). Hence, it assists in the development and allows the verification of \n\nmathematical models employed to calculate stresses and strains of real components or TF \n\nspecimens (Mallet, 1995; Guedou, 1992). \n\nSehitoglu (1996) sustains that an important distinction must be made between TMF \n\nand thermal shock. Thermal shock involves a very rapid variation in temperature (due to \n\nsurface heating or internal heat generation), and resulting strains are generally different from \n\nthose produced under slow heating and cooling conditions (i.e., quasi-static). Physical \n\nproperties such as conductivity and specific heat, which do not arise in cases of low strain \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nrate, are clearly present in thermal shock cases. Strain rate affects the material response and \n\nshould be taken into account when analyzing damage due to thermal shock or choosing \n\nmaterials with better thermal shock strength. \n\nSehitoglu (1996) and Sarabanda (1991) claim that if a body is subjected to thermal \n\ncycling conditions with overlaying loads in the section, the component will undergo cyclic \n\nthermal creep (thermal ratcheting), which is gradual accumulation of inelastic deformation \n\ncycles. This type of failure involves ductile rupture and fatigue mechanisms, which \n\nsometimes occur unintentionally during TMF tests when an area of the specimen is warmer \n\nthan its surroundings, causing a lump to appear in the hot area. \n\nCrack initiation under thermal fatigue is a decreasing function of distance from the \n\nsurface of the solid due to the stress-strain-temperature field generated in superficial areas of \n\nstructural components. Therefore, the driving force that propagates a thermal crack often \n\ndecreases with crack growth, since the farther the crack is from the stress-strain-temperature \n\nfield, the less it is influenced by thermal fatigue and the smaller is its propagation. However, \n\nin isothermal or thermo-mechanical fatigue testing, in which components are under uniform \n\ntemperature conditions, the crack, when growing toward the interior of the material, reaches a \n\nmore severe stress-strain field, since the cross-sectional area of the component is reduced by \n\ncrack growth (Hetnarski, 1991). \n\nThe design procedure of real components subjected to anisothermal fatigue is quite \n\ncomplex and can be basically divided into three steps: \n\n1. Determination of stress and strain distribution in these components during operation, \n\nwhich usually is accomplished with the aid of the finite element method. \n\n2. Determination of constitutive equations that describe the material mechanical behavior \n\nfor the in service conditions determined above. Whenever possible these equations \n\nshould take into consideration possible changes in material properties during \n\noperation. \n\n3. Development of life prediction models (number of cycles to failure), which enables \n\nthe safe use of the component in question by establishing its inspection and \n\nreplacement routines. These models should take into account factors other than \n\nfatigue, such as creep and oxidation interactions. \n\nThe total strain        measured during an anisothermal fatigue test is the sum of the \n\nmechanical strain        imposed by the testing equipment and the thermal strain (thermal \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nexpansion or        ) resulting from the change in temperature:                   for \n\nboth in-phase and out-of-phase thermo-mechanical tests (Figure 26b and a, respectively). \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 26: Thermal and mechanical variation and total strain in relation to time for out-of-\n\nphase (a) and in-phase (b) thermo-mechanical fatigue. \n\n \n\nThermal strain, obviously, does not cause stress and may be determined through the \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n                  (9) \n\nwhere      is the thermal expansion coefficient,   is temperature and      is room \n\ntemperature. On the other hand, mechanical strain may be decomposed into elastic (   ) and \n\ninelastic (   ) deformations: \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n            (10) \n\nwhere    is obtained through Hooke\u2019s law: \n\n          (11) \n\nwhere   is the measured stress and      is the elastic modulus in relation to instantaneous \n\ntemperature. In addition,     consists of two distinct components at sufficiently high \n\ntemperatures: plastic deformation (  ), caused by stress higher than the material elasticity \n\nlimit, and creep deformation (   ), due to thermal activation. These are some of the terms \n\nemployed in an anisothermal hysteresis loop, as shown in Figure 27. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27: Example of an out-of-phase anisothermal hysteresis loop (Engler-Pinto Jr., 1996). \n\n \n\nCoffin has summarized the basic stress-strain relationship for several heating histories \n\nand loops, as shown in Figure 28. \n\nIt is possible to see that the hysteresis curve is entirely complex and discontinuous, \n\nthereby explaining the great difficulty in predicting life under fatigue of components \n\noperating at high temperatures (Fuchs, 1980). \n\nThermal fatigue is seen as an unbalanced repetitive process, i.e., the response from the \n\ntensile part of the cycle differs from that of the other half (compressive region) and the \n\nresponse is a function of temperature. There are three basic aspects of stress-strain behavior \n\nthat are important unbalanced cyclic mechanisms: elasticity, plasticity, and creep (Hetnarski, \n\n1991). \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n1. Elasticity - the elastic stress-strain response of a solid is a function of temperature, \n\nsince the elasticity modulus invariably decreases with increasing temperature. Thus, \n\nan in-phase elastic thermo-mechanical cycle exhibits a nonlinear response since the \n\nsolid is hardened at the lowest temperature of the cycle. The elastic cyclic stress-strain \n\nresponse, shown in Figure 29, displays a concave-downward curvature. The cycle \n\nshown is completely reversed in terms of strain, but not with respect to stress. It may \n\nbe observed that tractive stress is lower than compressive stress, which corresponds to \n\nthe difference between elasticity modulus values at high temperatures. Thus, the \n\ndifference in unbalanced stress is a direct function of temperature range and level \n\n(Hetnarski, 1991). \n\n2. Plasticity \u2013 if a thermo-mechanical strain is high enough, the material will undergo \n\nplastic deformation. This results in a tractive stress response in relation to non-linear \n\nand unbalanced compressive stress (Figure 30). Usually, the elasticity limit decreases \n\nas temperature increases thereby giving a lower stress response to higher temperatures. \n\nPlastic and elastic deformation changes in spite of strain being entirely reversed \n\n(Hetnarski, 1991). \n\n3. Creep \u2013 the maximum stress peak is lower in thermo-mechanical tests with low strain \n\nrates, in which creep is favored, than in tests with higher strain rates because creep \n\ndecreases material strength (Figure 31). The stress peak response at low temperatures \n\nis essentially independent from the strain rate. Therefore, half the cycle corresponding \n\nto the highest temperature becomes more unbalanced as regards half the cycle \n\ncorresponding to the lowest temperature, with decreasing cycling rate and increasing \n\nmaximum cycle temperature, which are factors that favor creep (Hetnarski, 1991). \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28: Stress-strain relationship for various loading histories and cycling types: (a) \n\ncontinuous strain cycling; (b) level of strain (strain hold); (c) continuous cyclic mean stress; \n\n(d) level of stress (stress hold); (e) stress-strain hold limit (CP); (e) thermo-mechanical status \n\n(mixed mechanical-thermal) (Fuchs, 1980). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 29: Hysteresis curve under elastic thermo-mechanical strain conditions for phase \n\ncycling (Hetmarski, 1991). \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30: Hysteresis curve under plastic thermo-mechanical strain conditions for phase \n\ncycling (Hetmarski, 1991). \n\n \n\nFigure 31: Hysteresis curve under creep thermo-mechanical strain conditions for phase \n\ncycling (Hetmarski, 1991). \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n3.5 Effect of Porosity on Fatigue Life \n\n \n\nPorosity has a catastrophic effect on mechanical properties of aluminum alloys. A 1% \n\nvolumetric fraction of pores may reduce fatigue life by 50% and strength limit by 20% as \n\ncompared to the same alloy without pores (Odegard &amp; Pedersen. 1994). \n\nThe number of cycles needed for crack nucleation depends on loading, ranging from \n\n0% (at startup) to less than 10% of fatigue life (Slallerud &amp; Larsen, 1989), while the time \n\nneeded for crack initiation decreases with pore size. \n\nWoller curves (Figure 32) for aluminum alloys show that fatigue life increases when \n\nstress decreases and that for a given stress level the number of cycles to failure decreases \n\nwhen amount of gas introduced in the alloy increases (Buffi\u00e8re et al., 2001). The uncertainty \n\nabout fatigue life increases when stress and/or amount of gas decreases. This shows the \n\nimportance of pore quantity and distribution to fatigue life. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 32: S-N curves for three aluminum alloys (A, B, and C), with -0.131, -0.168, and -\n\n0.158 slopes (Buffi\u00e8re et al., 2001). \n\n \n\nBuffi\u00e8re and colleagues (2001) show that cracks responsible for ruptures nucleate on \n\none or more pores located on the surface of specimens or just below it. Except for high stress \n\nlevels, at which cracks nucleate by de-cohesion of internal silicon nodules (far from pores) \n\nprobably located at grain boundaries. It was observed that in the pores responsible for ruptures \n\ncrack nucleation occurs by de-cohesion of the silicon/matrix interface. In most cases this de-\n\ncohesion is produced on a silicon particle near a convex region (a pore) almost perpendicular \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nto the applied load. It has been noted also that even at low stress levels the number of cycles \n\nrequired for crack nucleation is negligible as compared to that of total fatigue life (<2%). \n\n \n\n3.6 Life Prediction Models \n\n \n\nSuresh (1998) states some approaches have been developed over the years in order to \n\npredict the total life of engineering materials under fatigue at elevated temperatures. Extensive \n\nreviews of life prediction models can be found in Coffin (1974), Tomkins and Wareing \n\n(1977), and Batte (1983). The most common life prediction methods may be classified into \n\nthree groups according to Suresh (1998): (a) damage accumulation models, (b) modified-\n\nfrequency Coffin-Manson equations and (c) deformation variation partitioning. A brief \n\nsummary of each method is presented below. \n\n \n\n3.6.1 Damage Accumulation Models \n\n \n\nThe simplest approach to fatigue-creep life prediction involves the linear accumulated \n\ndamage model, as described by Suresh (1998). In this method, the accumulated damage by \n\nmechanical fatigue and creep are linearly overlaid by means of the following equation: \n\n \n \n  \n\n \n   (12) \n\nwhere  \n \n and  \n\n \n are fractions of damage fatigue and creep, respectively. \n\nIf the material is subjected to    cycles under     stress variation and the number of cycles to \n\nfail under this stress is   , the fraction of fatigue damage is       , where summation is \n\nperformed for the total number of stress blocks with different amplitudes. Likewise, if    is the \n\naverage time for an applied average stress    and     is the time to fracture at that level of \n\nstress, then         indicates the amount of accumulated creep damage. For variable \n\namplitude loadings at high temperatures, the damage sum model is rewritten as follows: \n\n \n  \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n   (13) \n\nwhere   is the fraction of damage accumulated, which is usually equal to 1. \n\nThis approach is widely used in low-cycle fatigue tests in dwell periods. However, \n\nBatte (1983) found at least three problems in implementing the concept of linear damage sum: \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\ni. In periods of permanence under constant strain, stresses relax continuously; \n\nii. Cyclic softening and hardening lead to different stress relaxation levels during fatigue \n\nstrain; and \n\niii. Rupture stress results, employed in life prediction by means of Equation 12, are \n\nobtained through monotonic tests, which do not usually represent creep-fatigue \n\nbehavior. \n\n \n\n3.6.2  Modified-Frequency Coffin-Manson Equations  \n\n \n\nThe strain-life relationship for modified frequency was proposed by Coffin (1973), \n\nconsidering the effect of frequency on cyclic response at high temperatures. This relationship \n\nincorporates phenomenologically the term frequency (  ) into the Coffin-Manson relationship \n\ngiven by Equation 4 as follows: \n\n           \n       (14) \n\nwhere the constant    and the exponents   and   are specific to the temperature-material-\n\nenvironment system. \n\nThe strain-life behavior of many steels is satisfactorily described as an alternative to \n\nEquation 14, in which the deformation variation is separated into elastic and plastic \n\ncomponents as in Equation 8: \n\n                    \n                \n\n        (15) \n\nThe employment of Equations 14 and 15 to predict life under fatigue-creep requires \n\nknowledge of strain-stress loading hysteresis. \n\n \n\n3.6.3  Strain-Variation Partitioning Model \n\n \n\nThe strain-variation partitioning methods proposed by Halford et al. (1973) divide the \n\ntotal damage caused by thermo-mechanical fatigue interactions into mechanical elements and \n\nthose dependent on strain-variation time. Suresh (1998) claims that, on a microscopic scale, \n\ncyclic sliding is considered as the mechanism for time-independent mechanical fatigue, and \n\ncavitation and sliding of grain boundaries are considered as primary mechanisms affecting \n\ncreep-fatigue damage. Methods of strain-variation partitioning also take into account the \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nreversal of strain associated with fatigue and creep. In this method, any complete cycle of \n\ninelastic deformation variation is divided into four components: \n\ni.     , plastic deformation in reverse strain-stress; \n\nii.     , creep deformation in tensile and plastic deformation in compression; \n\niii.     , plastic deformation in tension and creep in compression, and \n\niv.     , creep deformation in reverse tension-compression. Figure 33 illustrates \n\nthe method of strain-variation partitioning. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 33: Schematic representation of inelastic deformation variation partitioned into four \n\ncomponents, E, P, and C representing elastic, plastic, and creep deformations, respectively \n\n(Suresh, 1998).  \n\n \n\nCyclic strength is associated with the four components of deformation variation by an \n\nequation of the type of Coffin-Manson potency law: \n\n            \n   \n\n              \n   \n\n      (16) \n\nFigure 34 shows the fatigue-life relationships for strain-variation partitioning. \n\nThe total life is thus determined by the sum of fractions of the four deformation \n\nmodes, as follows: \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n   \n (17) \n\nwhere indices denote the same strain-variation modes. \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nThe damage fractions are sometimes measured in proportion to the deformation-\n\nvariation magnitude of every mode. Several empirical modifications of this method are \n\navailable in order to incorporate effects of slow-fast loading fatigue (including effects of \n\ndifferent stress-strain paths in the cycle) and fatigue-creep dwell time in the estimation of \n\nfatigue life. \n\n \n\nFigure 34: Schematic representation of fatigue-life relationships for the partitioning of \n\ndeformation variation (Suresh, 1998). \n\n \n\n3.6.4  Diverse Models \n\n \n\nAccording to Shi et al. (1993), some life-prediction models based on low-cycle \n\nisothermal fatigue have been employed under thermo-mechanical conditions, such as the \n\ndeformation variation partitioning model, the deformation energy parameter model, the \n\nconstitutive model, and the thermal activation model. These models generally make use of the \n\nlinear damage theory and estimate the damage per cycle in the stabilization period using the \n\nparameter of damage to plastic deformation or strain energy density. Shi and colleagues \n\n(1993) and Shi and Pluvinage (1993) investigated the TMF strength of 316L stainless steel \n\nand proposed firstly a model of nonlinear kinematic hardening using internal variables to \n\ndescribe cyclic stress-strain behavior. Then, they established a model to estimate the damage \n\nto the material from the characteristics of stabilized cycles. From isothermal fatigue data, they \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\ndeduced a an equivalent model of variation of strain energy density as damage parameter with \n\nwhich TMF life was predicted satisfactory as compared to test results. \n\nGoals and Ellyin (1988) presented a unified theory based on the criterion of cyclic \n\nstrain energy density. It was shown that fatigue failure under high and low cycle, cumulative \n\ndamage, and loading sequence can be expressed in terms of a single damage parameter. The \n\ndamage criterion is based on the strain energy density per cycle (sum of energy of plastic and \n\nelastic traction deformation). The stages of initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks were \n\nincorporated into this model. The comparison to experimental data was satisfactory. \n\nAs indicated by Cai et al. (1999), the two most widely used models to predict life of \n\nvarious types of metallic materials subjected to TMF solicitation are models of damage \n\naccumulation and strain variation partitioning. However, these models must undergo some \n\nchanges in order to satisfy the anisothermal solicitation condition. \n\nThe damage mechanisms present in TMF of various metals involve three main aspects \n\ninvolved in anisothermal solicitation: failure caused by fatigue, environment (oxidation), and \n\ncreep. Depending on the temperature, deformation, and phase between the temperature and \n\nstrain cycles, all three mechanisms can operate jointly, according Neu and Sehitoglu (1989b). \n\nThe fatigue damage mechanism controls the life of metals under thermo-mechanical \n\nsolicitation conditions when temperatures are low, so the contribution of oxidation \n\nmechanisms of creep on life may be neglected, according to Falc\u00e3o (2002). \n\nIn an out-of-phase TMF test, in which the highest compressive stresses coincide with \n\nthe highest temperatures during the cycle, oxidative damage may be significant whereas creep \n\nfailure is negligible because growth of voids and inter-granular cracking is suppressed under \n\ncompression. In this case, life is determined by oxidation. \n\nNeu and Sehitoglu (1989a, 1989b) developed a general model for fatigue at elevated \n\ntemperatures, including thermo-mechanical fatigue. This model incorporates accumulated \n\ndamage due to fatigue, environmental attack (oxidation), and creep. The damage per cycle of \n\nthese mechanisms are added up to obtain the total damage per cycle. \n\n             (18) \n\nAssuming that linear damage is equal to 1 in the failure, Equation 18 may be rewritten \n\nin terms of life ( ), in which damage is equal to    : \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n  \n (19) \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nAccording to Cai et al. (1999), due to its complexity, a well-accepted framework for \n\npredicting TMF life has been rather vague. Several proposed models are but non-isothermal \n\ngeneralizations deriving from isothermal models. These models may be divided into two \n\ntypes: \n\n1. General models for predicting life under TMF based on fundamental physical \n\nmechanisms of crack initiation and propagation under TMF. Such models may \n\nbe used to capture and simulate damage mechanisms and their interactions \n\nunder TMF loading conditions. These models should be based on data about \n\nseveral materials, including analyses and micro-structural observations, and \n\ngenerally associated with visco-plastic constitutive models. Nevertheless, the \n\nformulas or set of equations for these models are complex and not convenient \n\nto engineering application. \n\n2. Empirical and engineering models have goals and direct applications aimed at \n\nengineering practice. They are intended for special materials to which the TMF \n\nlife prediction model was established. The formulas of this model are simpler \n\nand more convenient for applications. However, they are not in common use \n\namong several materials. \n\n \n\n3.6.5  Modeling of Anisothermal Hysteresis as a Function of Isothermal Data \n\n \n\nDetermining the behavior of anisothermal loading hysteresis using results from \n\nisothermal stress-strain curves is of great importance to life prediction models in TMF tests. \n\nCyclic behavior in low-cycle fatigue can be represented in three ways: (1) by \n\nanalyzing cyclic hardening or softening; (2) through stress-strain hysteresis (mechanical or \n\ninelastic); or (3) by means of cyclic hardening curves. The difference between the latter two \n\nmethods is that the cyclic hardening curve is represented by extreme stress and strain values \n\nobtained in several tests superimposed on a single graph. Stress-strain profiles thus obtained \n\nare not always individual hystereses, obtained during a test conducted within a fixed \n\ndeformation amplitude. \n\nTypically, cyclic strain hardening curves as well as stress-strain hystereses can be \n\nrepresented by a potency relationship, as suggested by Ramberg-Osgood, firstly for a \n\nmonotonic solicitation: \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n         \n  (20) \n\nThis equation may be adapted to cyclic loading: \n\n  \n\n \n    \n\n    \n \n\n \n \n\n (21) \n\nwhere    and   are constants of the material, varying with temperature. \n\nThrough interpolation of results obtained isothermally it is possible to determine the \n\nvalues of these constants for the temperature range of the anisothermal cycle. \n\nOne of the problems of using an equation such as the Ramberg-Osgood equation to \n\nsimulate an individual hysteresis is that, in the case of cyclic loading, the constants    and   \n\ntend to vary depending on the extent of plastic deformation imposed on the material. For this \n\nreason, it is unusual to find in the literature the employment of this equation as representing \n\nhysteresis itself, according Skelton (1994). \n\nAnother complication arising from the use of the Ramberg-Osgood equation is the \n\nabsence of a purely elastic regime, since all applied stresses would result in deformation, \n\nhowever small. This gradual transition from elastic regime to plastic regime makes it \n\nparticularly difficult to model the Bauschinger effect, whereby plastic deformation reduces \n\nthe elastic limit in compression and vice-versa. \n\nSkelton (1994) describes three methods employed to model anisothermal hysteresis: a \n\ngraphical method, a tangent modulus method, and a secant modulus method. The graphical \n\nmethod is most used in the literature due to its better suitability. \n\n \n\n3.6.6  Graphic Method Modeling \n\n \n\nA simplified modeling of isothermal behavior is possible through approximation to \n\ncyclic behavior by a linear plastic-elastic model, whereby the relationship between strain and \n\nstress in the plastic regime is given by an equation of the following type: \n\n                        (22) \n\nor else: \n\n                             (23) \n\nwhere    is the yield limit,     is the approximate slope of the hardening curve on a inelastic \n\nstress-strain graph,   is stress and     is inelastic deformation (which is used instead of plastic \n\ndeformation as it is a more suitable denomination for tests at high temperatures). \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nThese two equations define an upper boundary (traction) and a lower boundary \n\n(compression) of plastic deformation. The material behavior in the area between these two \n\nequations is purely elastic, governed by Hooke's law: \n\n              (24) \n\nwhere   is the elasticity modulus and   is the total mechanical deformation. \n\nIn this case, the Baushinger effect is automatically taken into account, since the \n\nvertical distance between the two inelastic equations is fixed and equal to     for any given \n\ntemperature, as shown in Figure 35. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 35: Schematic representation of difference between two inelastic equations (Engler &amp; \n\nSpinelli, 2002). \n\n \n\nEquations for the plastic regime may also be represented in relation to total \n\nmechanical deformation ( ): \n\n                     (25) \n\n                         (26) \n\nwhere   is the scaling constant for the plastic regime.    and    are related to values obtained \n\nwith the aid of the inelastic stress-strain curve. \n\nAccording to the model proposed by Engler and Spinelli (2002),    and     are \n\ndetermined so as dissipated plastic energy (area under the curve) is the same as that in the \n\nmodel proposed by Ramberg-Osgood. \n\nThe elastic limit used in the model proposed by Engler and Spinelli (2002) is \n\ndescribed by the following equation: \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\n          \n    \n\n   \n\n   \n  (27) \n\nand the scaling constant between   and    : \n\n           \n    \n\n  \n\n   \n  (28) \n\nAccording to the above equations, the estimation of anisothermal hystereses may be \n\ndone iteratively by dividing the thermo-mechanical (    ) into   periods and estimating the \n\ninelastic strain and stress for each point. \n\nThe model proposed by Engler and Spinelli (2002) provides a satisfactory \n\nrepresentation of loading hysteresis behavior for small inelastic deformations. \n\n \n\n3.6.7 Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue Modeling for Nucleation of Cracks \n\n \n\nThe development of numerical simulations in the past 20 years has promoted the \n\nimprovement of numerical tools and the development of new algorithms. It is possible today \n\nto estimate loads and displacement in structures rapidly and reliably. Nonetheless, studies on \n\nstructures subjected to multi-axial thermo-mechanical loading are still rare. \n\nOnly a small number of automotive components undergo severe cyclic thermo-\n\nmechanical loading capable of producing low-cycle fatigue. Most of these components are \n\nfound in engineering: engine head; engine exhaust; carter; brake disc, and so forth. It is \n\nimportant to note that problems caused by low-cycle fatigue to these components are related \n\nto the startup-shutdown-startup cycle, not to combustion cycles. \n\nThe process of thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) is quite complex, involving fracture \n\nmechanism due to creep and plastic deformation, which tend to be mainly influenced by the \n\nsolicitation type and cyclic changes in the material microstructure of the material in operation, \n\nsuch as oxidation and phase transformation (Sermage, 2000; Neu, 1989). Models that attempt \n\nto predict the life of a component subjected to thermo-mechanical fatigue are scarce, derive \n\nmostly from isothermal models, are adapted to particular cases, and cannot be generalized to \n\nother situations (Shi, 1993). Basically, the TMF modeling process should incorporate micro-\n\nstructural features (which are responsible for the material mechanical strength within the \n\napplied temperature range), thermal aspects (analysis on the flow and thermal distribution \n\npresent in the component), mechanical aspects (deformation and fracture mechanisms), and \n\ngeometric aspects (knowledge about stress distribution in the component under solicitation). \n\nTwo types of approach have been used to understand the TMF process: first, at the \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nmicroscopic level, by modeling crack initiation and propagation, and secondly, by taking the \n\nmaterial macroscopic behavior into account. The latter is more widely used and aimed at \n\nsimulating the response given by a material under thermal and mechanical stresses. In this \n\ncase, there have been employed continuum mechanics models as well as elasto-plastic and \n\nvisco-plastic models (Oller, 2005; Constantinescu, 2004; Charkaluk, 2002). \n\nPredicting the life of a given component subjected to thermo-mechanical loading \n\nrequires the knowledge (mapping) of the distribution of temperatures and stresses in its \n\nvolume (when in operation. In this context, one should begin by conducting a thermal analysis \n\non the component, which should simulate the flow of fluids (if present), allowing for heat \n\nexchanges with the structure, and simulate the cyclic heating and cooling throughout the \n\ncomponent. The temperature evolution may be determined by the following equation: \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n          (29) \n\nwhere   is density,   is specific heat, and   is thermal conductivity. \n\nIn order to solve this equation three boundary conditions are need: internal surface, \n\nexternal surface, and conduction on contact surface (adjacent components). \n\nThermal analysis is considered an important step in TMF modeling, because accuracy \n\nin temperature-related data requires accuracy when simulating the component mechanical \n\nbehavior (Thomas, 2004). \n\nThe analysis of the behavior of a structure subjected to thermo-mechanical solicitation \n\nhas been conducted, in this case, by means of an elastoviscoplastic model. This type of model \n\nhas proven to be simpler in plotting of stress-strain curves during cycles, because hypotheses \n\nare assumed that eliminates many variables that would make the problem much more \n\ncomplex. Moreover, the elastoviscoplastic model is valid for the component entire operating \n\ntemperature range. The main assumptions in this model are: (a) as the material cyclic behavior \n\nis stabilized, the initial transient, which can show material hardening or softening under \n\nsolicitation, is disregarded; (b) the damage-related parameters may be overlooked in the \n\nconstitutive law; therefore, there is decoupling in the approach to mechanical behavior with \n\ndamage variables. Below are shown the equations of two elastoviscoplastic models proposed: \n\n? Classic Visco-plastic Model combined with linear kinematic hardening, according to \n\nChaboche (1997). \n\n    \n   \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n       \n\n(30) \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\n     \n \n\n \n \n          \n\n \n \n\n \n   \n\n       \n \n\n        \n\n            \n\nwhere:     = elastic deformation tensor,   = Poisson modulus,   = elastic modulus,   = stress \n\ntensor (hardening),   = strength modulus,     = visco-plastic deformation tensor,   = \n\nviscosity,   = stress deviation tensor,    = yield stress,   = deformation tensor (hardening), \n\n   = 2\nnd\n\n stress tensor invariant,  = compliance tensor, and   = viscosity exponent. \n\n? Two-Layered Visco-plastic Model, in which stress is divided into viscous and \n\nplastics elements, according to Kichenin (1992). \n\n    \n      \n\n(31) \n\n    \n      \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n  \n   \n\n   \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n  \n        \n\n  \n   \n\n   \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n  \n        \n\n    \n \n\n \n \n      \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n      \n \n\n     \n    \n\n        \n \n\n       \n\n             \n\n             \n\n          \n\nwhere:    and    = elastic modulus tensor for plastic and elastic elements, respectively, and \n\n  = plastic multiplier. \n\nThe material parameters, embedded in the elastoviscoplastic model (e.g., modulus, \n\nviscosity, and yield stress) may be obtained through mechanical tests of \"tension-\n\ncompression-relaxation\" performed isothermally at different temperatures. In these cases, the \n\nparameters are assumed to show linear variation with temperature. \n\nNumerical simulation (EF) is a useful tool for solving equations specified in the \n\naforementioned model. The \"ABAQUS FINITE ELEMENT STANDARD CODE\" program \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nhas been widely used in these cases. Three algorithm types have been tested: forward \n\nEULER, backward EULER, and backward EULER with a radial return (Simo, 1998), the \n\nlatter producing the best results in less time under anisothermal loading (Charkaluk, 1999). \n\nAfter conducting thermal and mechanical analyses, the third step in TMF modeling \n\nconsists of selecting a fatigue criterion. This step has been considered challenging due to the \n\nanisothermal and multi-axial nature of the solicitations in this case. Two of the fatigue criteria \n\nare the relationship of a damage function (indicator) and the number of cycles to fail. The \n\nfunctions set for classic fatigue criteria (e.g., Manson-Coffin, Smith-Watson-Topper, \n\ndeformation variation partitioning), which include parameters such as total deformation \n\namplitude, maximum stress, Young's modulus, and material-dependent constants, have been \n\nproved inadequate for thermo-mechanical fatigue, mainly due to the difficulty in determining \n\nthese parameters in case of multi-axial thermo-mechanical loading (Constantinescu, 2004; \n\nCharkaluk, 2002; Thomas, 2004). Therefore, other ways were sought to represent the damage \n\nfunction. In this context, energy dissipated per cycle (  ) has been chosen to make this \n\nrepresentation. The expression that defines    is shown below, being applied (valid) when \n\nstress-strain cycles are stabilized. \n\n                     \n     \n\n (32) \n\nwhere   and   are stress and strain tensors, respectively, and   indicates the point analyzed in \n\nthe structure. \n\nThe energy dissipated per cycle may be considered a material parameter that expresses \n\nthe energy required for crack propagation in the process zone. There are three advantages to \n\nusing this parameter, according to Thomas (2004): (a) energy quantification can be \n\ngeneralized to multi-axial loading situations; (b) its determination is independent of \n\ntemperature; and (c)    is representative of the material cyclic behavior. Regarding the \n\nnumber of cycles to fail (  ), it has been proposed that the number of cycles considered \n\nbordering (         ) is that at which the first (macroscopic) crack is seen in the material, or \n\nwhen there is a decrease of about 10% in load (Constantinescu, 2004). Finally, the fatigue \n\ncriterion may be expressed as follows: \n\n               (33) \n\n \n\n3.7 Fatigue Crack Growth \n\n \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\nIn the past, studies on fatigue focused on damage processes and crack development. \n\nFrom the 1960s onward interest shifted to crack growth processes (Forsyth, 1963), due to the \n\nfact that fatigue crack growth does not occur catastrophically (there is sub-critical crack \n\ngrowth, which may be halted under certain circumstances) and that crack nucleation occurs in \n\na small part of the fatigue life. Cracks are usually formed very early in a material fatigue life \n\n(Fuchs &amp; Stephens, 1980). \n\nThus, the primary characteristic of fatigue failure is the gradual spread of a crack, \n\ncaused primarily by oscillation of loads applied to the component. Geometric cracks are \n\ndefects that resemble slots with very small tip radius, ideally zero. For this reason, it is not \n\npossible to apply the traditional stress analysis to cracks, because its stress concentration \n\nfactor ( ) is very large. \n\nHowever, propagation of fatigue cracks can be effectively dealt by traditional concepts \n\nof Fracture Mechanics, which show that the propagation rate       or how much a crack \n\ngrows per loading cycle depends primarily on the variation range of the stress intensity factor \n\n   applied. This became possible thanks to Paris and Erdogan (1963), who related the \n\npropagation rate of a fatigue crack to the stress intensity factor. By using mathematical tools \n\nof Fracture Mechanics to quantify the primary characteristic of fatigue failure, the slow \n\ngrowth of a crack in every loading cycle, Paris introduced the first truly innovative idea since \n\nW\u00f6hler, representing an important milestone in the history of research on fatigue. \n\nThis method of analysis, called the Law of Paris, predicts a parabolic relationship \n\nbetween       and    (Equation 34) and is suitable to describe the region where crack \n\ngrowth rate is linear. \n\n  \n\n  \n         (34) \n\nwhere   are   constants dependent on the material, environment, frequency, temperature, and \n\nstress ratio. \n\nExponent   for metallic materials is approximately 4 (four), which may be \n\nrationalized as accumulated damage and associated with the plastic zone volume (  ), since \n\nvolume    is estimated with   \n  and that       \n\n \n, then           . Some   and   \n\nvalues for several alloys are presented in Table 4. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nTable 4: Numerical parameter for Paris equation. \n\nMetallic Alloy     \n\nSteel 3 10\n-11\n\n \n\nAluminum 3 10\n-12\n\n \n\nNickel 3.3 4 x 10\n-12\n\n \n\nTitanium 5 10\n-11\n\n \n\n \n\nThe typical curves of fatigue crack propagation, when plotted on a graph (Figure 36) \n\nas            in relation to         , show a characteristic sigmoidal shape with three \n\ndistinct phases: (1) initial phase or Region I, with decreasing derivative; (2) intermediate \n\nphase or Region II, with constant derivative and linear behavior; and (3) final phase or Region \n\nIII, with increasing derivative. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 36: Curve representing       in relation to   . \n\n \n\nTherefore, there are three distinct areas or stages (Figure 37), in which the Law of \n\nParis and Erdogan is only valid for the intermediate region of crack growth, i.e., Region II. \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nRegion I, with crack propagation rate underestimated by the Law of Paris and \n\nErdogan, is characterized by the existence of an inferior limit (   ) below which there is no \n\ncrack propagation or propagation occurs at an undetectable rate for practical purposes. This \n\nphase is very sensitive to average load, material microstructure, and environment. \n\nRegion III, of unstable crack propagation (typically between 10-8 and 10-6 m/cycle), \n\nis important to characterize the component final failure, but contributes little to its life under \n\nfatigue (expressed in number of cycles). This region tends to display static fracture \n\nmechanisms: ductile mechanisms (e.g., cavitation and void/micro-cavity coalescence) and \n\nfragile mechanisms (e.g., cleavage), the propagation rate being underestimated by the Law of \n\nParis. This curve deviation occurs when      reaches toughness to fracture as      reaches \n\nvalues close to those of    and     of the material. \n\nRegion II, or intermediate region of crack growth, the Paris-Erdogan equation \n\ndescribes well the growth of a crack with exponent   ranging typically between 2 and 5. \n\nCrack growth is controlled by continuous mechanisms, insensitive to the microstructure, \n\naverage load, environment, and thickness of components. From the fractographic standpoint, \n\nit is in this region that stretch marks are observed on the surface characteristic of fatigue. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 37: Propagation stages of a fatigue crack. \n\n \n\nThe observation of fatigue fracture surface of ductile materials often reveals the \n\npresence of grooves perpendicular to the direction of crack propagation (Figure 38a). Laird \n\n(1967) and Pelloux (1969) were the first to explain the occurrence of these grooves by \n\nsuccessive crack blunting and sharpening due to plasticity. In order to understand the \n\nmechanism proposed by Laird one should follow the faces of a crack during a fatigue cycle \n\n(loading and unloading) (Figure 38b). At the beginning of loading, face displacement is done \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nby a simple elastic opening. As loading increases, a plastic zone forms in the region ahead of \n\nthe crack. It becomes less acute as the load increases and is accompanied by the creation of \n\nnew surfaces of plasticity. At the beginning of unloading, the crack closes elastically and as \n\nthe distant regions far from it are plastic, at zero load the deformation imposed on the plastic \n\nzone is zero. Therefore, the crack tip undergoes retained plastic deformation. This \n\ndeformation occurs at the end of the cycle, when the crack is almost closed and cannot make \n\nup for the plastic deformation that occurred when it was opened. Moreover, due to chemical \n\nreactions with air, the newly-created free surfaces are irreversible. The crack propagates, thus, \n\nto a length approximately equal to the rounding radius. In this propagation mechanism, the \n\nlength of a crack derives from a cyclic plastic deformation in the region ahead of it and, \n\ntherefore, the material cyclic plastic behavior plays an important role in propagation. \n\n \n\nPlastic blunting   measures deformation at the tip of a crack. Taking into account \n\nassumptions about displacement fields,   may be understood as a permanent part of CTOD \n\n(Crack Tip Opening Displacement). It is generally accepted that CTOD is the parameter that \n\ngoverns fatigue crack propagation under constant and variable loading (Masahiro, 2004). The \n\nrelationship between CTOD and crack propagation has been the subject of several studies that \n\npropose propagation scenarios from fractographic observations (Laird, 1967; Pelloux, 1969). \n\nAccording to this scenario, it is possible to note that there is a strong link between \n\ncrack length and surface opening. The law that equates these magnitudes is that of CTDO, \n\nproposed by McClintock (1967), which predicts crack propagation for loading of monotonic \n\namplitude. \n\n  \n\n  \n       (35) \n\nFor a material with perfect elasto-plastic behavior,       is given by: \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 38: (a) Fatigue grooves observed on rupture surface and (b) mechanism of propagation \n\nby rounding and sharpening of the crack tip.  \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\n        \n   \n\n    \n (36) \n\nwhere   is a scaling factor,   is the elastic modulus, and    is the yield stress of the material. \n\nThis last equation assumes a relationship between       and plastic zone size. In \n\nfact, the term     derives from the plastic zone size. Thus, in this case the Paris Law \n\nexponent is equal to 2 (two). Nebdal and colleagues (1989) proposed an empirical relationship \n\nbetween crack advancement and fatigue groove pitch, which is proportional to plastic \n\nrounding. This relationship was obtained by dividing the measured rate of macroscopic crack \n\npropagation during the test by the microscopic rate corresponding to the groove pace ( ) \n\nmeasured on the fracture surface (Figure 39). \n\n \n\nFigure 39: Relationship between groove paces and propagation rate. \n\n \n\nThe curve obtained comprises three regions corresponding to three Paris curve states. \n\nIn Region A, macroscopic velocity is lower than microscopic velocity, because some cycles \n\ndo not advance the crack (sterile cycles). The crack length in Region B corresponds to \n\napproximately one groove per cycle; this is the region in which the Law of Paris is valid. In \n\nRegion C, propagation rate is more than one groove per cycle, as other propagation \n\nmechanisms come into play such as ductile tearing. The proposed relationship (Equations 37 \n\nand 38) in this study for Region B is, thus, based on the relationship of Nebdal et al. (1989), \n\nbut it is a function of time instead of cycle. This formalism allows the handling of cases with \n\ncomplex cycles at variable amplitude and can more easily take into account time and \n\ntemperature-related effects on fatigue propagation. \n\n  \n\n  \n   \n\n  \n\n  \n se \n\n  \n\n  \n   (37) \n\n  \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n\n  \n se \n\n  \n\n  \n   (38) \n\nwhere   is a parameter of the material identified with the assistance of a crack propagation \n\ntest at constant amplitude. \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nIn order to establish the crack propagation rate at any given load, it suffices to \n\ndetermine the evolution of plastic rounding ( ) throughout loading. \n\nMany empirical rules have been proposed to better describe the sigmoidal shape of the \n\ncurve       in relation to    as well as the effects of some secondary variables, such as \n\naverage load (usually quantified by              ) and crack opening load (   ). The best \n\nknown rules are: \n\n  \n\n  \n             \n\n \n         \n\n \n Elber (39) \n\n  \n\n  \n           \n\n \n Walker (40) \n\n  \n\n  \n                 \n\n  Hall (41) \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n              \n \n\n           \n Forman (modificado) (42) \n\nAll these rules require the determination of constants such as  ,  , or  , which are \n\nobtained experimentally through fatigue crack propagation tests. Picking one of these rules \n\ndepends on the particular set of data to which one wishes to apply it. In many instances, \n\nseveral of them may be used with satisfactory results (Chang &amp; Hudson, 1981). \n\n \n\n3.7.1 Effect of Porosity on Fatigue Crack Growth \n\n \n\nIn most cases, fatigue cracks originate in pores irrespective of stress and deformation \n\n(Inguanti, 1985; Murali et al., 1997; Powell, 1994; Skallerud et al., 1993); most pores leading \n\nto cracks are located on the material surface or just below it (Couper et al., 1990; Seniw et al., \n\n1997; Wigant &amp; Stephens, 1987). After crack nucleation, propagation chronology can be \n\ndivided into four phases: \n\n- Inter-dendritic crack propagation, alternatively in   matrix and along interfaces of \n\nsilicon/matrix particles (Hoskin et al., 1988; Verdu et al., 1996); \n\n- Intra-dendritic crack propagation (Powell, 1994) \n\n- Rapid inter-dendritic crack propagation with damage to silicon particles ahead of \n\ncrack (Crepeau et al., 1992; Plumtree &amp; Schafer, 1986); \n\n- Final rupture. \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nWhen the crack is still small and is in the vicinity of the pore, it is sometimes possible \n\nto note a decrease or even a halt in propagation with a special frequency of the order of SDAS \n\n(Evans et al., 1994). \n\nThe crack propagation mechanism may be divided into two distinct regimes \n\ncorresponding to high and low stress levels. At high stress levels cracks propagate \n\ncontinuously in the material, i.e., they are not halted by micro-structural barriers and may be \n\ndescribed by Paris law. At low stress levels, once nucleated, cracks propagate rapidly \n\nthroughout the eutectic region until they reach a length of approximately 10-20?m. Just a \n\nsmall amount of these cracks keep on propagating. When this happens, growth is \n\ndiscontinuous, with numerous halts and may last several thousand cycles. In the period \n\nbetween these halts, growth rate of surface cracks may be higher or lower than that observed \n\nin long cracks for the same stress intensity factor   . These halts may be related to the \n\npresence of grain boundaries. \n\nTopographic observations indicate that 85% of pores located on the material surface or \n\nright below it nucleate cracks. Figure 40 shows that the probability of crack nucleation from \n\npores is neither necessarily related to the stress intensity factor nor to a maximum stress \n\ncriterion. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 40: (a) Classification of pores observed by tomography in a specimen after 233,000 \n\ncycles; for every pore, the effective stress level was measured in relation to the stress intensity \n\nfactor, estimated according to pore dimensions X and Y; (b) definition of X and Y on a pore \n\n3D diagram. \n\n \n\nFinally, it seems that pores smaller than 50\u00b5 do not nucleate cracks (Savelli, 2001). 3D \n\nimages show that cracks that do not propagate are smaller than the pores that nucleated them \n\n(Figure 41). \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 41: (a) Classification of pore observed by tomography on the surface of a specimen \n\nafter 233,000 cycles; for each pore, the measurement between the crack lateral length (  ) on \nthe surface (including pore) and the maximum lateral pore dimension below the surface (  ) \n\nis indicated in relation to   ; the different symbols indicate whether crack has not spread ( ) \n\nor has spread ( ); (b) definition of    and   : in black, intersection of pore with specimen \n\nsurface; in gray, 2D projection of 3D shape of pore below the surface (Buffi\u00e8re et al., 2001). \n\n \n\nCrack propagation depends on the available distance between the pore border and the \n\nnext favorably orientated grain boundary. If it is shorter than the corresponding pore diameter, \n\nthe crack will not propagate. \n\nCrack nucleation mechanisms are, therefore, the same for high and low stress levels. \n\nApplying a cyclic loading is conducive to de-cohesion between silicon particles and the \n\nmatrix, which leads to the development of small cracks. Two factors affecting this de-\n\ncohesion are, on the one side, the plastic and elastic compatibility existing between hard and \n\nfragile silicon particles and the ductile matrix and, on the other hand, the location of silicon \n\nparticles near convex regions of pores, which act as stress concentrators. Moreover, the grain \n\nboundaries play an important role due to supplementary plastic incompatibility, induced by it, \n\nbecause of its orientation. Crack nucleation at grain boundaries is favored because energy is \n\nminimized on the surface. Large and inter-granular pores also favor nucleation. \n\nIndeed, the influence of grain boundaries on crack propagation has been reported in \n\nthe literature for steels and aluminum. The physical processes that explain how a crack goes \n\nthrough a grain boundary are not yet clear. A probable mechanism is activation of sources of \n\ndiscrepancies in adjacent grains and creation of a new micro-crack by irreversible \n\naccumulation of discrepancies in the grain. As was observed by Buffi\u00e8re et al. (2001), the \n\ncrack came to a halt in tests in which there was observed the development of plastic zones in \n\nthe vicinity of the grain immediately ahead. \n\n  \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n3.8 Brief of Chapter 3 \n\n \n\n- In the strain-based approach there is low-cycle fatigue that may be characterized as: \n\n(1) high-strain cycling when the range of inelastic deformation in the cycle exceeds that of \n\nelastic deformation; and (2) inelastic deformations of such magnitude that they spread \n\nthrough the microstructure evenly. \n\n- An isothermal fatigue test consists of imposing varying mechanical strains at \n\nconstant temperature. \n\n- Thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) describes fatigue under variation of both \n\ntemperature and mechanical strain and may involve several mechanisms that add damage to \n\nthat of \"pure\" fatigue, including creep and oxidation at elevated temperatures, which directly \n\ncontribute to further damage. These mechanisms differ from each another, depending on \n\nstrain and temperature history. \n\n- There are three basic aspects of stress-strain behavior that are important unbalanced \n\ncyclic mechanisms: elasticity, plasticity, and creep. \n\n- Porosity has a catastrophic effect on mechanical properties of aluminum alloys. A \n\n1% volumetric fraction of pores may reduce fatigue life by 50% and strength limit by 20% as \n\ncompared to the same alloy without pores and the time needed for crack initiation decreases \n\nwith pore size. \n\n- Some approaches have been developed over the years in order to predict the total \n\nlife of engineering materials under fatigue at elevated temperatures. \n\n- Propagation of fatigue cracks can be effectively dealt by traditional concepts of \n\nFracture Mechanics. The typical curves of fatigue crack propagation, when plotted on a \n\ngraph as            in relation to         , show a characteristic sigmoidal shape with \n\nthree distinct phases.  \n\n- In most cases, fatigue cracks originate in pores irrespective of stress and \n\ndeformation, most pores leading to cracks are located on the material surface or just below it. \n\nAfter crack nucleation, propagation chronology can be divided into four phases: (1) inter-\n\ndendritic crack propagation, alternatively in   matrix and along interfaces of silicon/matrix \n\nparticles; (2) intra-dendritic crack propagation; (3) rapid inter-dendritic crack propagation \n\nwith damage to silicon particles ahead of crack; (4) final rupture. \n\n  \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4: FINITE ELEMENTS  \n\n \n\n4.1 Brief History \n\n \n\nThe idea behind the finite element method is not attributed to a single person or group \n\nof people from the same historical period. Over two thousand years, Greek philosophers \n\ndeveloped theories which assumed that all things were composed of countless particles. So set \n\nLeucippus and Democritus that everything was made by an infinitely large number of \n\nparticles, called atoms by the latter. Eudoxus, creator of the \"exhaustion method\", which \n\nconsists of inscribing and circumscribing rectilinear figures into curvilinear figures, already \n\nproposed syncretizing a continuous figure to facilitate certain calculations. This method \n\nallowed the calculation of areas of curved figures and volumes of solids such as spheres and \n\ncones. It is equivalent to passing to the limit of integral and differential calculus. \n\nMore recently, in the 1930s, McHenry (1943) and Hrennikoff (1941) replaced a \n\ncontinuous element, e.g., a plate, for a structure formed by bars following the original \n\ngeometry, maintaining the same binding conditions and loads. \n\nDespite taking into consideration a continuous medium discretized by elements with \n\nknown stiffness and elasticity, these methods, which have given rise to matrix analysis, do not \n\npresent the conceptual aspect implicit in the finite element method. \n\nNot only does it transform a continuous solid into a combination of discrete elements \n\nand write equations of compatibility and balance between them, but it also admits continuous \n\nfunctions that represent, for instance, the displacement field in the domain of an element and, \n\nsubsequently, obtains the corresponding deformation condition, which, together with the \n\nmaterial constitutive relationships, allows the definition of the stress condition in the entire \n\nelement. \n\nThis stress condition is transformed into internal efforts, which have to be in balance \n\nwith external actions. \n\nThis formulation derives from the Rayleigh-Ritz method, which is based on \n\nminimizing the total potential energy of the system, expressed in relation to the pre-\n\nestablished displacement field (displacement method). \n\nA renowned mathematician, Courant (1943), applied this procedure to the study of \n\nSaint-Venant torsion of hollow sections. \n\nArgyris and Kelsey (1964) published a series of papers in the mid-1950s, in which the \n\nmatrix formulation of the Rayleigh-Ritz method was categorically determined and has been \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\napplied to analyze especially aircraft wings and fuselage, simulating them as consisting of \n\nbars and panels. \n\nThe finite element method had its formula established as it is presently known with the \n\npublication of the study of Turner and colleagues (1956). They showed that it was possible to \n\nreplace the properties of the continuum in a more direct, not less intuitive way, assuming that \n\nsmall portions (elements) behave in a simplified fashion. \n\nClough (1980), author of the term (method of finite elements in opposition to \n\ninfinitesimal elements of differential calculus), describes in details his involvement in the \n\ndevelopment of this method in a paper published in 1980. \n\nDespite its formulation having been known since the 1950s, the finite element method \n\nbecame disseminated and applied in various fields of engineering due to the rapid \n\ndevelopment and expansion of computers. \n\nToday, there are hundreds of commercial computer programs currently used in various \n\nareas of knowledge, which employ this method in linear and nonlinear analysis. \n\nThe finite element method is now well-established in engineering so that its \n\nknowledge is essential to be able to intelligibly work with commercial software programs \n\nexisting in almost all project management firms (Assan, 2003). \n\n \n\n4.2 Finite Element Method \n\n \n\nNumerical simulation is one of the stages to be developed in order to design a \n\ncomponent (Figure 42). The component should be analyzed in light of strength criteria, the \n\nclassic fatigue theory, and the finite element method. \n\nIn order to predict the performance of mechanical components, a designer has at hand \n\ntoday a series of mathematical tools that can be applied. Analytical solutions may be used in \n\ncertain cases, but its application is limited to specific situations where a mathematical solution \n\nof the structure can be found. A more comprehensive way of dealing with structural problems \n\nis the use of numerical analysis methods. Although these methods provide approximate \n\nsolutions, in many cases they are the only way designers have to find the answers they are \n\nseeking. \n\nThe Finite Element Method (FEM) takes into consideration the region of problem \n\nsolution as consisting of small interconnected elements. The region under study is analytically \n\nmodeled or estimated by a set of pre-defined discreet elements. Once these elements are \n\nplaced together in a countless number of different configurations, it is possible to model very \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\ncomplex geometrical forms. Moreover, it provides designers with a great deal of flexibility in \n\nthe application of loads and boundary conditions, which makes FEM the most widely \n\nemployed method in structural analysis nowadays. \n\nFEM is suitable to a wide range of problems of boundary values in engineering. In a \n\nboundary value problem, a solution is sought in the body region (domain) whereas in the \n\nboundaries of this region the values of dependent variables (or their derivatives) are known. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 42: Design cycle. \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\nAccording to Huebner (1994), the method may be summarized into three stages: \n\n1. Pre-processing: the preparation stage of the problem to be solved later. It is in this \n\nstage that the phenomenon is modeled, assuming hypotheses, initial conditions, \n\nboundary conditions, and loadings. It also includes selecting the element, material \n\nproperties, and geometry that will represent the shape of the component in question. \n\nThe following are two important preprocessing sub-stages: \n\n? Continuum discretization: the continuum is the physical body shown in Figure \n\n43, structure or solid under analysis. The discretization viewed in Figure 44 \n\ncan be simply described as the process by which the domain is subdivided into \n\nan equivalent system of finite elements, which can be, for instance, triangles or \n\nquadrangles for 2D problems or tetrahedrons and hexahedrons for 3D \n\nproblems. These elements have the so-called nodes, which can be internal or \n\nexternal, i.e., located in the interior of the element or at its edges. Although \n\nthere have been attempts to automate the process of domain subdivision, it \n\nremains essentially dependent on engineers\u2019 discrimination and expertise; \n\n? Selection of interpolation functions: the assumed displacement or interpolation \n\nfunctions represent only approximately the exact or actual distribution of \n\ndisplacements. Generally, the form adopted for the interpolation functions is \n\nthe polynomial, due to its requiring simple mathematical manipulation. There \n\nare three interrelated factors influencing the selection of interpolation \n\nfunctions: choice of type and degree of function (as the type usually adopted is \n\nthe polynomial, only the degree should be selected) and the type of field \n\nvariables that describe the model (usually, displacements at the nodes or their \n\nderivatives). Finally, the model must meet certain requirements to ensure that \n\nnumerical results come close to the correct solution; \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 43: The exhaust fan (a) physical problem and (b) the continuum. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 44: The continuum discretized by countless elements. \n\n \n\n2. Solver: the solution of the problem has as its starting point the model set during the \n\nprevious stage. Therefore, the accuracy of responses depends critically on the \n\nresearcher\u2019s ability to take apart the phenomenon. The solution is based on a \n\nnumerical algorithm aimed at solving as quickly and accurately as possible a \n\ndifferential equation with boundary conditions and/or initial conditions imposed by the \n\nmodel. Following are some sub-stages to solve the problem: \n\n? Obtaining the elemental stiffness matrix: the stiffness matrix consists of \n\ncoefficients of equilibrium equations derived from geometric and material \n\nproperties of an element and can be obtained by using the principle of \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\nminimum potential energy. Stiffness relates nodal displacements to forces \n\napplied at the nodes. The equilibrium relationship between the stiffness matrix \n\n   , the nodal force vector    , and the nodal displacement vector     is \n\nexpressed as a set of simultaneous linear algebraic equations,            . \n\nThe stiffness matrix of an element depends on the interpolation function, \n\nelement geometry, and local properties of the material; \n\n? Assembly of algebraic equations for the entire domain: the process includes \n\nassembling the global stiffness matrix for the whole body from elementary \n\nstiffness matrixes and the global force vector from elemental force vectors. In \n\ngeneral, the basis for an assembly method is the requirement of nodal \n\ninterconnections. Displacements at a node must be the same for all adjacent \n\nelements; \n\n? Solutions for unknown displacements: algebraic equations assembled in the \n\nprevious step are solved for unknown displacements. In linear problems, this is \n\na relatively straightforward application of matrix algebra techniques. However, \n\nfor nonlinear problems, the desired solutions are obtained by a sequence of \n\nsteps, each involving the modification of stiffness matrix and/or strength \n\nvector; \n\n? Calculation of elemental strains and stresses from nodal displacements: in \n\nsome cases, nodal displacements are the variables under study for the solution. \n\nOften, however, other quantities derived from unknown variables such as \n\nstresses and strains must be estimated. In general, stress and strain are \n\nproportional to the derivatives of displacements. \n\nIt is important to remark that these numerical algorithms may be implemented \n\ncomputationally to accelerate calculation. Nowadays, it is possible to find \n\ncomputational packages such as ANSYS, NASTRAN, ABAQUS and others, \n\neach program having advantages and disadvantages to problem modeling. \n\n3. Post-processing: it is the last stage. It depends only on the researcher\u2019s modeling \n\nneeds, i.e., it is the solution to the differential equation that describes the phenomenon \n\nunder study as shown in Figure 45. It may be: \n\n? Nodal displacements; \n\n? Geometry deformations; \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\n? Stress gradients according to selected strength criterion; \n\n? Temperature gradients; \n\n? Nodal displacements over time; \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 45: Typical post-processing stage of a commercial package. \n\n \n\nThese features, implemented computationally, allow the estimation of the solution to a \n\ncomplex problem in a relatively short time, optimizing the development time for projects of \n\nanisotropic or isotropic materials subjected to static, thermal, and dynamic loadings, and so \n\nforth. \n\n \n\n4.3 Behavior Model \n\n \n\nThere are two classic models of material behavior: \n\n? The first, purely phenomenological, is at a macroscopic scale, i.e., it operates \n\nthrough global variables (e.g., stress, strain, and internal variables). This \n\napproach allows the modeling of experimental phenomena with a limited \n\nnumber of variables, thus engendering a lack of physical basis. \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\n? The second, known as micro-macro, is at a microscopic scale and seeks to \n\npredict the macroscopic response by changing scales from physical parameters \n\nsuch as density and movement of discrepancies, nucleation and propagation \n\nphenomena, and the distance between precipitates. The problem with this type \n\nof application is that the number of steps between the microscopic mechanisms \n\nand macroscopic response is very large, which usually complicates the \n\nconstruction of complete models for industrial alloys, and that most authors use \n\nit only to predict yield stress (Gandin et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n4.4 Presentation of Proposed Crack Growth Model \n\n \n\nThe first elements of this model were developed in a study on crack propagation in \n\nturbine disc carried out by Pommier and Risbet (2005). The model was subsequently \n\nidentified, implemented, and validated for fatigue crack propagation in steel employed in train \n\nwheels at room temperature by Hamam and Pommer (2007). The incremental crack \n\npropagation model is composed of two parts: \n\n? A propagation law that provides the instantaneous speed of creating the cracked \n\narea per length of the crack front in relation to the instantaneous speed of plastic \n\nrounding of the crack. This first part of the model is identified by using a test of \n\nfatigue crack propagation at constant amplitude. \n\n? A plastic rounding law that allows the determination of the global speed of \n\nplastic deformation in the crack front region in relation to applied load and \n\ninternal variables of the model. These internal variables define in a \n\ncomprehensive way the condition of residual stresses and material hardening in \n\nthe plastic zone. This second part of the model is identified by using finite \n\nelement calculations and requires identification of the material cyclic elastic-\n\nplastic behavior. \n\nThus, fatigue damage modeling is decoupled from plasticization modeling in the crack \n\nfront region. This decoupling is possible due to the fact that the characteristic dimension of \n\nthe damaged area is much inferior to that of the plasticized zone. The plasticized zone \n\ndimension is comparable to the size of fatigue grooves (in the order of micrometers) or to the \n\nsize of grains. Hence, this hypothesis is valid as long as the plastic zone dimension is larger \n\nthan 100\u00b5m. \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\nOtherwise, FEM is only employed to establish the global cyclic plastic model of the \n\ncrack front region. The approach used to establish this method\u2014the plastic rounding law\u2014is \n\nas follows: \n\nGood finite element calculations enable to estimate the evolution of stresses and \n\nstrains at each point in the crack front region. Taking the behavior peculiarities of the material \n\ninto account by its behavior law, which comprises at least one isotropic hardening and one \n\nnonlinear kinematic hardening. \n\nNext, a scale-changing method is applied to identify, from finite element simulation, a \n\nsimplified model of cyclic elastic-plastic behavior in the region ahead of the crack on a global \n\nscale. The scale-change principle is simple, it is based on an approximation of the kinematics \n\nat the crack tip. In Mode I, the displacement field at the crack tip is assumed to decompose \n\ninto an elastic part and a plastic part. It is assumed, for both parts, that they are the result of an \n\nintensity factor (a function of boundary conditions and crack geometry) and a reference field \n\n(a function of space coordinates only). \n\nThe study of plasticity at the global scale for the region ahead of the crack is done by \n\ninvestigating the intensity factor evolution of the plastic part of the displacement (plastic \n\nrounding) field, identified by   . \n\nThe evolution of plastic rounding (  ), estimated by means of finite elements, allows \n\nthe establishment of a simplified model of global cyclic elastic-plastic behavior for the crack \n\nfront region, i.e., a model that enables to calculate        in relation to applied nominal \n\nloading        from a set of partial differential equations. \n\nOtherwise, a crack propagation law is introduced to provide the instantaneous speed of \n\ncreation of cracked area per unit of crack tip length       in relation to the instantaneous \n\nspeed of plastic rounding       . \n\nThe set enables subsequently to calculate the propagation speed of fatigue cracks for \n\ncomplex loadings taking the effects of the loading history into account. \n\nSeveral aspects of this approach are detailed below. In the context of this text, the \n\nsensitivity of this approach with respect to the material behavior law was investigated for a \n\ngravity-cast aluminum-silicon alloy, employed in the manufacture of automotive engine \n\nheads. \n\n \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\n4.4.1 Study of Displacement Field at Crack Tip \n\n \n\nHypothesis of Displacement Field Projection \n\n \n\nLet          be a point in a local coordinate system fixed in a normal section in the \n\nregion ahead of a crack (Figure 46). As the load applied to the crack is known, a simplified \n\nform of displacement of this point is then sought. The goal here is to reduce the number of \n\nfreedom degrees of the problem so that simulation does not result in high calculation times, \n\nconsidering that industrial problems require quick and satisfactory responses. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 46: Coordinate system around the crack. \n\n \n\nThe rupture linear mechanics provides displacement fields in the crack tip region by \n\nasymptotic development in view of the distance   to this tip. The first term of this \n\ndevelopment is expressed as the product of the stress intensity factor, varying over time, and a \n\nreference field solely dependent on the point coordinates with respect to the crack tip. Hence, \n\nat first just the stress intensity factor    is useful to characterize loading at the crack tip. The \n\ncrack propagation criteria are, thus, be described as a direct function of   , which becomes the \n\nonly freedom degree of the problem. \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nIn the cyclic elastic-plastic context, the displacement field in the crack tip region is \n\nexpressed as: \n\n                     \n\n \n\n (45) \n\nwhere        is a basis of the reference spatial field and       are the problem temporal \n\nparameters. These temporal parameters constitute the freedom degrees of the problem on \n\nglobal scale and, thus, may be applied to the crack propagation criterion. \n\nAt first, FEM was employed to calculate displacement fields            in the cyclic \n\nelastic-plastic context. Then, these calculated fields are treated in order to justify the approach \n\nchosen and the problem temporal parameters are calculated. \n\n \n\nMethodology  \n\n \n\nThe displacement field sought is, therefore, assumed to be decomposed into a basis set \n\nto the reference site at each point of the crack front, composed of two reference fields: an \n\n\"elastic\" field       and a \"plastic\" field      . This partitioning has the advantage of \n\nreducing to two the number of the problem freedom degrees. The two freedom degrees \n\nconstitute the intensities of the reference fields: stress intensity factor     , pre-factor of the \n\nelastic field      , and plastic blunting ?, pre-factor of the plastic field      : \n\n          \n             (46) \n\nNumerical solutions may be employed in both fields, but they can also be expressed \n\nanalytically. In fact, the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is interesting because it can be \n\nperformed without having a priori the solution sought, but it is very costly in terms of \n\ncalculation time. It is simpler, therefore, to provide an analytical expression for the \n\ndisplacement field at the crack tip and then employ the minimum squares method to \n\ndetermine temporal coefficients from the results of a FEM calculation. Furthermore, giving an \n\nanalytical expression for the reference field entails the interpretation of the results. \n\nIt is possible, for instance, to choose Westergaard analytical solution for the reference \n\nelastic field, for the stress intensity factor. The analytical expression of the displacement field \n\naround a crack tip in Mode I can then be given by: \n\n        \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n   \n\n \n     \n\n \n\n \n  (47) \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\n        \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n   \n\n \n     \n\n \n\n \n  (48) \n\nwith:        and          \n\nMoreover, the plastic displacement field       retained is the wedge-shaped one, \n\nplaced in a horizontal direction below the crack plane. Under this assumption, Equations 49 \n\nand 50, the normal displacement of surfaces of the crack     is constant and equal to 1. So \n\nthe pre-factor   of this field can be interpreted as plastic crack blunting or CTOD (crack tip \n\nopening displacement). \n\n  \n \n      \n\n \n\n      \n            \n\n  \n\n  \n  (49) \n\n  \n \n      \n\n \n\n      \n                   (50) \n\nIn practice, during post-processing of FE calculations, the numerical solution of a finite \n\nelement calculation previously done on the same mesh is used for the field       and \n\nEquations 49 and 50 for the field      . \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Model Evolution Equation  \n\n \n\nThe applied approach is concisely as follows. First, a local approximation is employed \n\nto calculate in detail, by finite elements, the evolution of stresses and strains in the region of \n\nthe crack tip due to the material behavior and applied load. Then, one goes from local to \n\nglobal scale by applying the approach under the aforementioned displacement. In general, it is \n\npossible to obtain the temporal evolution of plastic blunting, for every finite element \n\ncalculation. Associated with this development is a model of behavior of the material that will \n\nbe employed to simulate cyclic plasticity in the crack tip region. Finally, it is necessary to \n\nhave a crack propagation law that can relate crack propagation speed to plastic blunting speed \n\nin order to calculate fatigue life. \n\n \n\nPlastic Blunting Law  \n\n \n\nPlastic blunting of crack faces is calculated by FEM, supported by a simplified \n\nrepresentation of the displacement field in the crack front region. An experimental rounding \n\ndetermination was possible today thanks to novel experimental media employed to measure \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\nthe displacement field, such as image correlation. This experimental technique is more \n\nlaborious than FEM calculation and enables to characterize the evolution law of   only on the \n\nsurface. Moreover, although this technique has the advantage of not being dependent on the \n\nchosen material behavior, it does not allow the separate study of the evolution of model \n\nvariables in relation to   and  , i.e., the crack advances without the occurrence of plastic \n\nrounding  or plastic rounding occurs without the plastic crack advancing. \n\nThis study employed FEM, but it is interesting to use image correlation in future \n\nstudies at least to validate numerical calculations. Figure 48 shows the evolution of plastic \n\nrounding obtained by FEM in relation to intensity factor of the stress applied to an increasing \n\ncharge-discharge succession. This was achieved by applying the projection defined above. \n\nThis ensured that the plastic zone in the front crack was confined to the   dominance region. \n\nThe evolution curves of plastic rounding   show that after every inversion in loading \n\ndirection (from tractive to compressive and vice-versa) there is a region    \n  during which \n\n  does not vary (Region C). As   measures plasticity at the crack tip, this region may be \n\ndefined as the critical cyclic domain of the crack. It is possible to note that this domain can \n\nshift throughout solicitation. Hence, it is associated with an internal variable such as linear \n\nkinematic hardening, i.e., one that defines the position (    ) of this domain. A second \n\nvariable is also introduced to define its dimension, which is generally constant. \n\nLikewise, it is possible to note a discontinuity in the evolution curve during tractive \n\nloading. This discontinuity appears when the applied load exceeds the maximum load \n\npreviously reached (D). This rupture in slope corresponds to the loading point beyond which \n\nthe monotonic plastic zone at the crack tip extends. Point D is, thus, the limit of the crack \n\nmonotonic plasticity domain (Region M). The lower limit of the monotonic plastic zone \n\ncorresponds to the point where surfaces meet. Below this contact point, plastic rounding no \n\nlonger evolves. It stops evolving even if compression continues, because the crack is closed. \n\nMoreover, the proposed projection has no effect now and, therefore, is not performed. Again, \n\ntwo internal variables are brought into the elasticity field, one for position     , which is \n\ntaken as the contact point, and another for its size, which is usually variable (Figure 47). \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 47. Evolution of plastic rounding in relation to applied stress intensity factor. \n\n \n\nThe rounding model describes, with the help of a set of analytical equations, the \n\nevolution laws of each of these internal variables as well as of   in relation to applied load \n\nand the current value of these variables. It is important to note that the internal variables      \n\nmay vary as the crack tip region deforms plastically          , but also because the tip of the \n\ncrack moves         . To determine these laws of evolution, several calculations are \n\nperformed from the start of crack propagation. Previous works have established simple \n\nevolution laws for each of the variables and defined a strategy to identify parameters of these \n\nlaws. The main equations of these laws are presented below. In all cases, the following \n\nrelationship between the nominal stress intensity factor and the thermodynamic force   \n\nassociated with  : \n\n           com    \n    \n\n  \n (51) \n\nIndeed, as    and    are related through the crack propagation law, the same rule may \n\nbe employed to relate the contact point position, known as    , which is determined by the \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\nnominal stress intensity factor, to the internal variable    , associated with the center \n\nposition of the monotonic elasticity domain. In short, the model is written as follows: \n\n? Extension of \n\nmonotonic plastic \n\nzone: \n\n     \n  \n\n  \n   \n\n(52) \n\n? Propagation law: \n  \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n?

Material parameters:                      \n\n? Initial values:      \n           \n\n \n\nThe material parameters are identified automatically with the help of the minimum \n\nsquares method and supported by a set of finite elements calculations.

In addition, it represents a considerable advantage as \n\nregards time. This two-stage resolution does not affect the propagation calculation results \n\nbecause internal variables evolve rapidly in relation to plastic rounding (few dozen microns). \n\nHowever, their evolution is much slower with crack growth (few hundred microns). Hence, \n\nthe scale of a fatigue cycle, the update of internal variables in relation to   can be performed \n\nat the end of a calculation increment and not in real time, for crack advancement does not \n\ninterfere significantly with variables. \n\nNumerical integration of differential equations of the plastic rounding law is done \n\ninitially by implicit integration, the calculation time required for this type of resolution being \n\nin the order of few dozen minutes to simulate one million cycles in two dimensions. \n\nCalculation time is the same for variable and constant amplitude loadings since in both cases \n\ncalculation is done incrementally. Moreover, these calculation times are not prohibitive. \n\nHowever, calculation time increases rapidly when the model is applied to a 3D problem and \n\nhas to calculate the advance of the crack at various points in the crack front region for every \n\nincrement. A method of integration by parts validated by making some suppositions with the \n\naim of reducing calculation time is presented in Annex 1. \n\nIn short, at the beginning of each calculation increment, the borders of cyclic and \n\nmonotonic plasticity are known.

The component should be analyzed in light of strength criteria, the classic \n\nfatigue theory, and the finite element method. \n\n- FEM is suitable to a wide range of problems of boundary values in engineering and \n\nthis method may be summarized into three stages: (1) pre-processing, (2) solver and (3) post-\n\nprocessing. \n\n- There are two classic models of material behavior: The first, purely \n\nphenomenological, is at a macroscopic scale, i.e., it operates through global variables (e.g., \n\nstress, strain, and internal variables); and The second, known as micro-macro, is at a \n\nmicroscopic scale and seeks to predict the macroscopic response by changing scales from \n\nphysical parameters such as density and movement of discrepancies, nucleation and \n\npropagation phenomena, and the distance between precipitates. \n\n- The incremental crack propagation model is composed of two parts: (1) a \n\npropagation law that provides the instantaneous speed of creating the cracked area per length \n\nof the crack front in relation to the instantaneous speed of plastic rounding of the crack. This \n\nfirst part of the model is identified by using a test of fatigue crack propagation at constant \n\namplitude; and (2) a plastic rounding law that allows the determination of the global speed of \n\nplastic deformation in the crack front region in relation to applied load and internal variables \n\nof the model. These internal variables define in a comprehensive way the condition of \n\nresidual stresses and material hardening in the plastic zone. This second part of the model is \n\nidentified by using finite element calculations and requires identification of the material \n\ncyclic elastic-plastic behavior. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5: METHODOLOGY  \n\n \n\n5.1 Experimental Procedures \n\n \n\n5.1.1 Materials \n\n \n\nThis study employed an aluminum-silica alloy (A356), whose chemical composition is \n\npresented in Table 5. The main characteristics of this alloy are good mechanical strength, high \n\nresistance to corrosion, thermal treatability, and weldability. The material was cast in \n\npermanent mold (PMC). In addition, material was obtained from the component itself (engine \n\nhead). \n\n \n\nTable 5: Nominal chemical composition of the aluminum-silica alloy under study. \n\n \nELEMENTO \n\nSi Mg Fe Cu Zn Mn Ti Al \n\n% Peso 6.5-8.5 0.25-0.45 0.1-0.7 0.1-3.0 0.10-0.8 0.10-0.4 0.10m\u00e1x 86.0-92.0 \n\n \n\n5.1.2 Manufacturing Process \n\n \n\nPermanent Mold Cast \n\n \n\nThe permanent cast standardized according to ASTM B108-08 (2008) was employed \n\nto obtain two cylindrical strain specimens cast by gravity (12.5mm diameter). The mold \n\ndesign included feeding and distribution channels and heads, which produced specimens with \n\nmicrostructure presenting a very low quantity of defects. The PMC process included \n\ndegasification, refining, and modification of silica particles.

After machining, the specimens were sanded with 320, 600, and \n\n1200-grit sandpaper and then polished with 10\u00b5m chromium oxide down to a mirror finish. \n\nDue to the low emissivity coefficient1 of polished aluminum, the usable area of specimens \n\nreceived a coating of matte black paint (heat resistant up to 600\u00b0C) prior to testing at elevated \n\ntemperatures in order to facilitate infrared pyrometer reading. \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 52: Machined, polished, and painted specimens. \n\n \n\n5.1.4 Mechanical Test System \n\n \n\nThe mechanical testing system was part of LAPROMEC equipment (Laboratory of \n\nMechanical Properties of the Department of Materials, Aeronautical, and Automotive \n\n                                                 \n1\n Radiance of a body at a given temperature and radiance of a black body at the same temperature. \n\nRadiance or emissivity corresponds to the density of light flow per unit area from a luminous or lit \nsurface. \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n\nEngineering) at S\u00e3o Carlos campus of S\u00e3o Paulo University (USP). The testing equipment \n\nconsisted basically of an induction heating system coupled to an MTS 810 testing machine, in \n\nwhich a microcomputer connected to the system monitored and controlled specimen \n\ntemperature and deformation during tests through an infrared pyrometer and a ceramic rod \n\nextensometer, respectively. \n\n \n\nHeating System \n\n \n\nThe heating system consisted of an INDUCTOHEAT induction furnace (7.5 kW \n\npower and 200 kHz frequency), equipped with a CNT110 INCON programmable temperature \n\ncontroller. The furnace had a coupled inductor coil made of copper (5 mm diameter), specially \n\ndesigned to envelope the specimen, heating it uniformly, and allow the extensometer rods to \n\npass in between the coils. \n\n \n\nInfrared Pyrometer \n\n \n\nSpecimen temperature was measured by means of an infrared pyrometer with laser \n\nsight (RAYTEK, Thermalert SX series, D9ETXSLTCF1L2 model) for temperatures ranging \n\nfrom -18\u00b0C to 500\u00b0C. The temperature measured by this sensor served as a control parameter \n\nfor the induction furnace and data acquisition system of the testing program. Fatigue tests \n\nabove room temperature require precise temperature measurements in the central region of \n\nspecimens, without physical contact, thereby avoiding problems such as crack initiation due to \n\nthermocouples welding. \n\n \n\nTesting Machine \n\n \n\nTensile, isothermal and anisothermal fatigue, crack propagation, and relaxation tests \n\nwere performed in an MTS 810 250kN servo-hydraulic testing machine, equipped with an \n\nMTS Flex Test GT controller. Fatigue and relaxation tests were done under strain control, \n\nusing an MTS 632.54F14 model extensometer for high temperatures, consisting of two 2-mm \n\ndiameter ceramic rods attached to the specimen by a coil system. Tensile tests under \n\ndisplacement control also employed this extensometer. Crack propagation tests were \n\nconducted under load and displacement control for cyclic and no-dwell loadings. All tests \n\nused an MTS 680.01B model system of hydraulic grips for high temperatures and a grip \n\ncooling system. Figure 53 presents an overview of the testing system. Figure 54 shows the \n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\nsystem of grips, infrared pyrometer, and extensometer for fatigue tests. Figure 55 shows the \n\nspecimen details, induction coil and grip cooling system. The auxiliary grip cooling system \n\nfor fatigue tests at high temperatures is composed of two coils made with copper pipes, \n\nthrough which chilled water circulates, and two compressed air hoses coupled to the ends of \n\nthe upper and lower grips. \n\n \n\nFigure 53: Testing system showing induction furnace and MTS 810 servo-hydraulic \n\nequipment. \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 54: System of grips, infrared pyrometer, and extensometer for fatigue testing.. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 55: Details of specimen, induction coil, and auxiliary grip cooling system. \n\n \n\nControl and Monitoring System \n\n \n\nEach type of mechanical test required a different MultiPurpose TestWare (MPT) \n\nsoftware program for the MTS Flex Test GT controller as well as PID adjustment in order to \n\nachieve better equipment performance and, consequently, reliable data. Crack propagation \n\ntests employed a potential drop method (MDP), in which control was performed through a \n\nnano-voltmeter and a DC source connected to the MTS controller.

Tensile tests were conducted in this work \n\nmainly to obtain important properties of the alloy in question, e.g., yield strength and \n\nelasticity modulus, which are useful for calculating deformations measured in thermo-\n\nmechanical fatigue tests and to make appropriate parameters available for the finite element \n\nmodel. The tensile test specimen geometry is shown in Figure 57. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 57: Tensile test specimen for different temperatures. \n\n \n\n5.1.6 Isothermal and Anisothermal Fatigue Testing \n\n \n\nFatigue tests were performed under controlled strain. All tests were performed at \n\nmechanical deformation ratio      . The failure criterion used was a 50% drop of the \n\nmaximum stress reached during the experiment. Isothermal tests employed 0.1Hz frequency \n\nin order to come near the maximum frequency used in anisothermal fatigue tests, whose \n\nperiods are relatively long (about 300s) owing to difficulty in cooling specimens down. \n\nHowever, this type of test is usually conducted over long periods in order to avoid excessive \n\ntemperature gradients in specimens during heating and cooling. In addition, temperatures in \n\nanisothermal tests were imposed by a triangular wave with maximum cycle temperature \n\ncoinciding with maximum mechanical deformation (in phase) according to initial ASTM \n\nE2368-10 guidelines. Isothermal or low-cycle fatigue tests at high temperatures were \n\nperformed according to ASTM E 606-04\n?1\n\n. \n\nThe alloy mechanical behavior was assessed through cyclic hysteresis of inelastic and \n\nmechanical strain-stress and progression of some testing parameters in relation to number of \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\ncycles, e.g., maximum and minimum inelastic strains and stresses as well as total inelastic \n\ndeformation energy and Ostergren energy (tensile deformation energy of hysteresis) for \n\nmechanical strain levels representing overall behavior. Anisothermal fatigue tests were \n\nconducted under in-phase conditions, i.e., maximum mechanical deformation coinciding with \n\nmaximum cycle temperature. \n\nIsothermal and anisothermal fatigue lifetime results were assessed by means of \n\nmechanical variation (   ), inelastic deformation (    ), stress (  ), total deformation \n\nenergy, and Ostergren energy in relation to number of cycles to fail (  ). \n\nThe specimen geometry commonly employed in isothermal and anisothermal fatigue \n\ntests is shown in Figure 58. \n\n \n\nFigure 58: Geometry of fatigue test specimens. \n\n \n\nCyclic hardening curves (  as a function of  ) were determined for different \n\ntemperatures. The method chosen for obtaining the cyclic hardening curve is the gradual \n\nincrease in strain applied to the specimen, producing a stable hysteresis for each strain level \n\nused (an anisothermal example is given in Figure 59). The effect of strain rate (     ) on \n\nhysteresis shape was also investigated by varying the test frequency. \n\nAmong other factors, the material behavior depends on the gap between      and      \n\ncycles or, put differently, on the chosen shape of cycle     . In fact, through a TMF (thermo-\n\nmechanical fatigue) test, it is possible to simulate the behavior of any volume element from a \n\nreal component as long as the thermo-mechanical load (    ), which the volume element is \n\nsubjected to during operation, is known. \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 59: Anisothermal hystereses obtained between 600\u00b0C and 900\u00b0C for IN738LC alloy. \n\n \n\nCycle shape traditionally employed in the study of thermo-mechanical fatigue are in-\n\nphase, i.e., maximum mechanical deformation coinciding with maximum cycle temperature \n\n(Figure 60a), and out-of-phase, minimum mechanical deformation coinciding with maximum \n\ncycle temperature (Figure 60a). \n\n \n\n   \n(a) In phase (b) Out of phase (c) ?Diamond? \n\nFigure 60: Cycle formats usually employed in thermo-mechanical fatigue tests. \n\n \n\nThermo-mechanical fatigue testing is also very useful in identifying damage and \n\nfracture mechanisms of materials submitted to anisothermal solicitations. At the end of cyclic \n\nhardening tests, the specimens were sectioned and metallographically prepared for \n\nexamination under optical and scanner microscopes. These observations enabled the detection \n\nof occasional micro-structural changes due to exposition to test temperatures as well as the \n\nidentification of sites favoring crack nucleation under isothermal and anisothermal conditions. \n\n \n\n5.1.7 Crack Growth Tests \n\n \n\nCrack propagation tests were conducted at 120\u00b0C, 200\u00b0C, and 280\u00b0C on a corner notch \n\nof specimens designed in accordance with the component geometry (Figure 51 and Figure \n\nT\ne\nn\n\ns\n\u00e3\no\n (\n\nM\nP\n\na\n)\n\nDeforma\u00e7\u00e3o mec\u00e2nica (%)\n\n1,0 %\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\nE F G H\n\nIN738LC\n\n(a)\n\n-1000\n\n-500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nI J\n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\n52b). The loading rate employed was          and cracks were monitored by means of the \n\npotential drop method. Crack propagation tests under thermo-mechanical loading conditions \n\nwere attempted during approximately 1 (one) year, but to no avail, despite much effort. \n\n \n\n5.1.8 Micro Structural and Fracture Analysis \n\n \n\nMicro-structural observation of the aluminum alloy was done under an optical \n\nmicroscope. A quantitative image analysis software program (Image Pro Plus) was employed \n\nto determine size and morphology of phase ?, eutectic distribution, and porosity level.  \n\nThe morphological aspect of fracture surfaces of some specimens tested for isothermal \n\nand anisothermal fatigue and crack propagation was analyzed by scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM). \n\n \n\n5.2 Computational Procedures \n\n \n\n5.2.1 First Step \n\n \n\nThis step comprised the adaptation to a computational modeling software program \n\nexisting on the market. The chosen program was ABAQUS STANDARD FINITE \n\nELEMENT CODE, due to its simplicity in testing new models and algorithms, e.g., forward \n\nEULER, backward EULER, and backward EULER with a radial return. The last one presents \n\nthe best and fastest results under anisothermal loading conditions, according to Charkaluk \n\n(1999).  \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Second Step \n\n \n\nIt consisted of improving the model of crack propagation developed by Professor \n\nSylvie Pommier in the Laboratoire de M\u00e9canique et Technologie (LMT) at L\u2019\u00c9cole Normale \n\nSup\u00e9rieure de Cachan (ENS-Cachan-France) for loading applied to a real component (engine \n\nhead), i.e., under anisothermal conditions, given that a component can operate in the presence \n\nof cracks as long as they do not reach a critical size conducive to catastrophic failure. \n\n \n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\n5.2.3 Third Step \n\n \n\nThis step consisted of a computational implementation of the improved mathematical \n\nmodel. To this end, FORTRAN and PYTHON, whose written code would become part of an \n\nABAQUS subroutine, was employed. Then, the model was evaluated by using test data \n\nobtained from strain, fatigue, and crack propagation specimens. \n\n \n\n5.2.4 Fourth Step \n\n \n\nIn future studies, this step will comprise the application of the model developed and \n\nvalidated on specimens to real components in operation. To this end, it will be of fundamental \n\nimportance to map temperatures and stresses to which the component is subject in operation. \n\nThis step will count on the support of General Motors Brazil and will be conducted \n\nexperimentally through sensors coupled to the component. \n\n  \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Brief of Chapter 5 \n\n \n\n- Thermomechanical fatigue test methodology was developed with successful in the Lab of \n\nthe University of S\u00e3o Paulo.   \n\n- The communication between the equipments purchased, induction furnace, temperature \n\ncontroller and mechanical testing machine was successful. \n\n- The use of the potential drop methodology for measurements of the fatigue crack growth \n\nhas been improved \n\n- The application of the model of crack propagation developed by Professor Sylvie Pommier \n\nin the Laboratoire de M\u00e9canique et Technologie (LMT) at L\u2019\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de \n\nCachan (ENS-Cachan-France) for isothermal loads applied to a specimen was performed in \n\nthe Lab of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo with successful. \n\n- Crack propagation tests under thermo-mechanical loading conditions were attempted during \n\napproximately 1 (one) year, but to no avail, despite much effort. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6: RESULTS AND DISCUTION \n\n \n\n6.1 Experimental Results \n\n \n\n6.1.1 Micro-structural and Chemical Analysis \n\n \n\nThe results of chemical analysis via optical emission spectrometry by spark is shown \n\nin Table 6, the uncertainty value (U) being 2%. The analysis was performed in an ARL 3400 \n\noptical emission spectrometer. ASTM E2055-99 (Standard Practice for Referencing Test \n\nMethods for Chemical Analysis of Metals and Related Metals) was used as reference. Before \n\nproceeding to the analysis, the spectrometer chamber was cleaned and the spectrometer \n\ncalibrated using RBC-certified standards. Three (3) surface burnings were performed. \n\n \n\nTable 6: Results of chemical analysis through spectrometry (% in weight). \n\nElements Si Fe Cu Mn Mg Cr Ni \n\nAlloy A356 8.63 0.98 3.13 0.45 0.326 0.03 0.03 \n\n \n\nElements Zn Ti Ca P Pb Sb Sn \n\nAlloy A356 0.66 0.027 ND 0.002 0.06 ND 0.02 \n\n \n\nElements Sr V Zr B Cd Co Al \n\nAlloy A356 ND 0.01 ND 0.0005 ND ND Base \n\n \n\nIn comparison to nominal values of chemical composition (Table 5), it is possible to \n\nobserve that Si, Fe, Mn, and Cu weight percentages are slightly above the nominal ones, \n\nbesides Mg and Zn, which are near the maximum limit. As previously seen, this can be highly \n\ndetrimental since iron and copper are the main impurities in Al-Si alloys. Cu weakens these \n\nalloys when hot and iron is particularly harmful since it is conducive to formation of acicular \n\nplatelets, which significantly reduce ductility and fracture toughness (Figure 9). However, \n\nwhen balanced with manganese, iron forms a more compact eutectic phase (Al15(Fe, \n\nMn)3Si2, Chinese script-shaped (Figure 61), which is less detrimental to mechanical \n\nproperties (Crepeau, 1998). Zn is a weakening factor when hot and promotes high shrinkage \n\nduring cast solidification, giving rise to contraction voids. Mn causes a small reduction in the \n\nmaterial ductility. \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 61: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of fractured surface of a fatigue crack \n\npropagation test specimen. \n\n \n\nChemical composition analysis was also performed by EDS (Energy Dispersive \n\nSystem) in EDX LINK ANALYTICAL equipment (Isis System Series 200), with SiLi \n\nPentafet detector, ATW II (Atmosphere Thin Window) ultrathin window, 133eV-5.9keV \n\nresolution, coupled to an electron microscope.

This alloy \n\nmicrostructure is composed of primary ? phase, Si-rich eutectic, precipitates (Mg2Si, Al2Cu), \n\nand inter-metallic components (Al5FeSi, Al8Mg3FeSi6, Al5Mg8Cu2Si6). The micro-structural \n\naspect of the alloy shows a well-defined dendrite structure with secondary dendrite arm \n\nspacing (SDAS) of approximately 25\u00b5m, in addition to a high porosity level (Figure 65a and \n\nb, dotted-dashed arrow) and also shows considerable modification of silicon particles (Figure \n\n65b, full arrow).

The material under \n\nanalysis displayed typical porosity as high as 50\u00b5m. However, the diameter of some voids \n\nreached 500\u00b5m. The porosity analysis was conducted with the aid of Image Pro Plus software \n\nfrom micrographs randomly taken in transversal and perpendicular directions under an \n\nOlympus microscope coupled to an image acquisition system. Figure 66 shows the \n\nmicrographs used in this analysis as well as the corresponding regions of voids. There may be \n\nobserved a high porosity level deriving from the casting process mainly due to failed cast \n\ndegasification. Notwithstanding, despite the significant size of voids, they can hardly be \n\ndetected through conventional techniques, e.g., ultrasound and X-ray, employed by auto \n\nfactories, more so in sample analysis. \n\nTable 8: Quantitative analysis of material porosity. \n\nAlloy Average Porosity [Area %] Standard Deviation [Area %] \n\nA356 9.49 3.10 \n\n \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n\n\n142 \n\n \n\n \n(c) \n\n \n(d) \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\n \n(e) \n\n \n(f) \n\n\n\n144 \n\n \n\n \n(g) \n\n \n(h) \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(j) \n\n\n\n146 \n\n \n\n \n(k) \n\n \n(l) \n\nFigure 66: Metallographic analysis of specimens obtained from engine head \n\ntransversally (a), (c), and (e) with corresponding images of casting voids (b), (d), and \n\n(f); and perpendicularly (g), (i), and (k) with corresponding images of casting voids \n\n(h), (j), and (l). \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\nThese voids, shown in detail in Figure 67, constitute stress concentrators, which can \n\nnucleate cracks, thus decreasing lifetime in nucleation.

It may be observed that, in general, isothermal tests \n\ncannot represent thermo-mechanical behavior. An exception may be made, due to the high \n\ncost of anisothermal tests, when isothermal tests are conducted under the most critical \n\nanisothermal conditions. \n\nMicro-structural refinement and porosity level are closely related in cast alloys \n\nbecause a large part of voids, especially those that are large and irregular, originate in inter-\n\ndendrite regions as a result of local dendrite contractions of microscopic magnitude. Hence, \n\nthe coarser the microstructure, the greater is contraction in inter-dendrite regions and the \n\nlarger are the voids. On the other hand, these contractions are minimized in a refined \n\nmicrostructure. It is generally known that there is a higher tendency for crack nucleation in \n\npores with diameters larger than 50\u00b5m. As the porosity level of the material under study is \n\nhigh (Table 8), fatigue lifetime is believed to have been damaged. \n\nDespite conducting isothermal fatigue tests at a low frequency as compared to that of \n\nanisothermal tests, it becomes high. The period of exposition to high temperatures promotes \n\nthe occurrence of other effects, e.g., relaxation and creep, which explain the anisothermal \n\nhysteresis behavior seen in Figure 76(c) and shows that these phenomena interact with fatigue \n\ndue to extended test periods at high temperatures. \n\nFigure 76(a) indicates that the material behavior under thermo-mechanical fatigue, \n\nconsidering in-phase mechanical and thermal loadings, is similar to the isothermal one at \n\n280\u00b0C, i.e., at maximum test temperature. Thus, it is should be observed that the greatest \n\ndamage in anisothermal tests occurs when maximum stress is applied at the highest \n\ntemperature. Figure 76(c) shows that the thermo-mechanical hysteresis is similar to the \n\nisothermal one at 280\u00b0C, differences owing to micro-deformation mechanisms at high \n\ntemperatures, e.g., creep and relaxation. This is because the thermo-mechanical loading cycle \n\nis about 0.003Hz, much lower than the isotherm one (0.1Hz). Therefore, in this case, \n\nisothermal tests at maximum temperature could offer a good estimate of deformation behavior \n\nduring cyclic loading, provided that costs and experimental difficulties of thermo-mechanical \n\nfatigue tests are taken into account. \n\n \n\n\n\n160 \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n10 100 1000 10000\n\n1E-3\n\n0,0015\n\n0,002\n\n0,0025\n\n0,003\n\n0,0035\n\n0,004\n\n0,0045\n\n0,005\n\n0,0055\n\n0,006\n\n \n\n \n\n FI-120\u00b0C\n\n FI-280\u00b0C\n\n FTM\n\n \n \n/2\n\n [\nm\n\nm\n/m\n\nm\n]\n\n2N\nf\n [Reverse]\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n200\n\n \n\n \n\n FI-120\u00b0C\n\n FI-280\u00b0C\n\n FTM\n\n \n \n/2\n\n [\nM\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n2N\nf\n [Reverse]\n\n\n\n161 \n\n \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 76: Comparison between graphs of (a) mechanical deformation amplitude in relation to \n\nthe number of reversals to fail, (b) stress amplitude as a function of the number of reversals to \n\nfail, and (c) hysteresis related to isothermal and anisothermal tests for 0.3% total mechanical \n\ndeformation. \n\n \n\nIn general, in both isothermal and anisothermal tests, cracks began to propagate in \n\nregions of inter-dendrite voids near the surface. Crack propagation exhibited similar behavior \n\nin both cases. In some instances, intrusion and extrusion mechanisms operated in the \n\nbeginning of tests, causing cracks to nucleate and propagate through the ductile matrix in a \n\ntrans-granular mode. Subsequently, because of higher tensile stresses, cracks tended to \n\npropagate through the eutectic, which is more brittle. \n\n \n\n6.1.2.4 Relaxation \n\n \n\nIn order to better identify the viscous behavior shown in the hystereses of the thermo-\n\nmechanical fatigue tests, relaxation tests were conducted at 80\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C, 120\u00b0C, 140\u00b0C, \n\n180\u00b0C, 240\u00b0C, and 280\u00b0C for total deformation levels of 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 0.9%. \n\nThe tests were performed by controlling deformation, using the extensometer employed in \n\nfatigue tests, and adjusting test parameters to obtain reliable results (Figure 77).

At lower temperatures, the material \n\nhardens cyclically whereas it softens cyclically at higher temperatures. High temperatures \n\nhave the effect of promoting atom rearrangement in the crystal structure, i.e., atoms shift \n\npositions to reach a more perfect and undeformed arrangement, thus facilitating the movement \n\nof dislocations. The stress vs. plastic deformation curves shown in Figure 78 also indicate that \n\nalthough the test was performed under controlled strain, i.e., total strain was kept constant \n\nthroughout the test, there was an increase in the amount of plastic deformation and \n\nconsequently a decrease in elastic deformation so that total deformation remained constant. \n\nTherefore, this increase in plastic deformation corresponded to creep deformation. \n\nFigure 79 shows some stress vs. time curves for a constant deformation level of 0.5% \n\nobtained at 100\u00b0C, 180\u00b0C, and 280\u00baC. It is possible to note that the higher the test temperature \n\n(T), the lower is the maximum stress (    ) required for this level of deformation. In general, \n\nthe higher the temperature ( ), the higher is the stress variation (  ) at a constant deformation \n\nlevel. When this level of stability is extended, i.e., the period in which deformation remains \n\nconstant, stress keeps falling. It is important to remark that, since determining a threshold \n\nstress was not the purpose of this study, the maximum test period was five minutes, long \n\nenough to determine the material behavior and obtain viscosity parameters from the curves. \n\n\n\n166 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n\n\n167 \n\n \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 79: Stress vs. time curves for a constant deformation level of 0.5% at 100\u00b0C, 180\u00b0C, \n\nand 280\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n6.1.2.5 Fatigue Crack Growth \n\n \n\nFatigue crack propagation tests were performed with specimens from the component \n\n(cylinder head), with special geometry as shown in Figure 52b. The tests were conducted at \n\n75\u00b0C, 120\u00b0C, 200\u00b0C, and 280\u00b0C, and loadings at R = 0.1 produced a sinusoidal wave shape, \n\nwith 10 Hz frequency, or a trapezoidal wave shape, consisting of a loading ramp and an \n\nunloading ramp lasting 10s each and a 180s constant loading level, totaling a 0.005Hz \n\nfrequency. Loading values were estimated for each temperature so as not to plasticize the \n\nregion ahead of the crack. Several methods for measuring the progress of the crack were tried, \n\ni.e., visual method, image correlation method (Correli), and acetate replica method, but to no \n\navail, probably due to the cast material microstructure and the impossibility of polishing the \n\nsurface as much as required. Then, the potential drop method was used and the relationship \n\nbetween values obtained through it and crack growth was obtained according to ASTM E1457 \n\n07\n?1\n\n. Figure 80 shows the fracture surface of a specimen tested for fatigue crack propagation, \n\ncriteria employed to define the points    and   , and calibration curves. The time used for \n\ndata acquisition was approximately 1 (one) point per second. These data were filtered to \n\n\n\n168 \n\n \n\neliminate noise due to numerous factors such as power fluctuations, vibrations caused by \n\nhydraulic system of mechanical testing machine, small temperature fluctuations, and so on. \n\n \n(a) \n\n  \n(b) (c) \n\nFigure 80: Fracture surface of a specimen tested for fatigue crack propagation and (a) criteria \n\nemployed to define the points    and   , and (b) and (c) calibration curves. \n\n \n\n\n\n169 \n\n \n\nFigure 81 presents the results of the fatigue crack propagation test at 75\u00b0C under \n\nsinusoidal wave loadings. It would be expected to have values around         for the limit \n\nstress intensity factor (    ), usually found for aluminum alloys. However, values for the \n\nmaterial under study (A356 gravity cast aluminum alloy) were well below expected, given the \n\nobserved quantity of porosity and microstructural heterogeneity. \n\n \n\nFigure 81: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor (  ) at \n75\u00b0C under sinusoidal wave loading. \n\n \n\nFigure 82 shows results of fatigue crack propagation tests at 120\u00b0C under sinusoidal \n\nwave loading (CP01 and CP02) and trapezoidal wave loading (CP3). It may be observed that \n\nfor the same level (  ) and sinusoidal wave loading there was a significant decrease in stress \n\nintensity as compared to that obtained at 75\u00b0C, which indicates the influence of temperature \n\non crack development and, as a result, formation of a plastic region ahead of it. Trapezoidal \n\nwave loading under load control was more detrimental than sinusoidal wave loading, showing \n\nan increase in crack growth rate in the order of 100 (one hundred) times. This may be \n\nexplained by the occurrence of other phenomena, which could not be observed previously due \n\nto loading mode, interacting during the test and aggravating it. Indeed, trapezoidal wave \n\nloadings with plateau time of the order of 3 minutes allow the occurrence of phenomena such \n\nas oxidation, creep, and relaxation, because the material is under maximum loading for a \n\nlonger period. \n\n\n\n170 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 82: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor \nvariation (  ) at 120\u00b0C and under sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave loadings. \n \n\nTest results of fatigue crack propagation at 200\u00b0C in Figure 83 show a slight decrease \n\nin stress intensity as compared to tests performed at 75\u00b0C and 120\u00b0C. However, crack \n\npropagation rates remain practically constant in cyclic sinusoidal wave loading tests. There is \n\nalso a small spread in results (CP04), which may be attributed to lack of homogeneity of the \n\nmaterial in question as well as its high porosity level. These behaviors are intensified by \n\nincreasing the test temperature. \n\n\n\n171 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 83: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor \nvariation (  ) at 200\u00b0C and under sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave loadings. \n \n\nFigure 84 presents the test results of fatigue crack propagation at 280\u00b0C under \n\nsinusoidal wave loading (CP01, CP02, and CP03) and trapezoidal wave loading in view of: \n\n(1) load control (CP04) and (2) constant deformation control (CP05). Again, it was observed \n\nthat the propagation rate increased with increasing temperature. The spread of results for tests \n\nunder sinusoidal wave loading (CP01, CP02 and CP03) increased slightly, indicating a \n\ndeleterious effect of temperature, which increases further the influence of lack of \n\nhomogeneity and high porosity of the material under study on its mechanical properties. \n\nWhen the loading mode was changed to trapezoidal under load control (CP04), the \n\ncrack propagation rate increased significantly as compared to the same kind of loading \n\nconducted at 120\u00b0C. As compared to tests conducted under sinusoidal wave loading at the \n\nsame temperature (280\u00b0C), trapezoidal wave loading was more detrimental, indicating an \n\nincrease in crack growth of the order of 100 (one hundred) times. This increase was identical \n\nto that observed at 120\u00b0C for trapezoidal wave loading in relation to sinusoidal wave loading. \n\n \n\n\n\n172 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 84: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor \nvariation (  ) at 280\u00b0C and under sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave loadings. \n \n\nIn the crack growth test under trapezoidal wave loading and displacement control (CP05), it \n\nmay be observed that the crack growth rate remains constant, unlike the test conducted under \n\nload control. This is because during the plateau, when control is performed by piston \n\ndisplacement (LVDT), the material undergoes relaxation, i.e., a decrease in applied load and, \n\nconsequently, in stress intensity. This phenomenon is the opposite of creep, observed when \n\nthe test is performed under load control (CP04), maintained constant during the plateau, \n\nwhere there is specimen elongation. Figure 85 illustrates these two phenomena. During a \n\ncycle of a crack propagation test under trapezoidal wave loading and load control during the \n\nplateau, the material underwent slight elongation (Figure 85a), whereas under displacement \n\ncontrol, the material experienced a release in applied load (Figure 85b), suggesting the \n\noccurrence of creep and relaxation, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n173 \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 85: Comparative graph of displacement and strength in relation to time for a cycle, \n\ncorresponding to crack growth tests under trapezoidal wave loading and (a) constant load and \n\n(b) constant displacement. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 86 presents crack length ( ) vs. number of cycles ( ) graphs from fatigue crack \n\npropagation tests under trapezoidal wave loading and load control (Figure 86a) and \n\n\n\n174 \n\n \n\ndisplacement control (Figure 86b). It may be noticed that in load-control tests, the derivative \n\n(     ) is positive and increases as   rises, generating a linear crack growth rate, beginning \n\nat a lower limit in which crack propagation is virtually imperceptible up to a higher limit, \n\nclose to specimen fracture, in which cracks propagate in an erratic fashion. On the other hand, \n\nin controlled-displacement tests,       is constant, producing constant crack growth rate \n\nthroughout the test. This occurs because during long plateau periods, in which displacement is \n\nconstant, applied stress undergoes relaxation. \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n\n\n175 \n\n \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 86: Graph of crack length as a function of the number of cycles for crack propagation \n\ntests under trapezoidal wave loading and (a) load control and (b) displacement control. \n\n \n\nFigure 87 shows a comparative graph of crack propagation tests conducted at 75\u00b0C, \n\n120\u00b0C, 200\u00b0C, and 280\u00b0C under sinusoidal wave and dwell loadings and load and \n\ndisplacement control. An Increase in test temperature causes mechanical strength to decrease, \n\nordinarily observed in metallic materials and widely reported in the literature. This fact \n\nexplains the decrease in the stress intensity shown in Figure 87, which is a function of applied \n\nload and, in turn, should decrease as temperature rises so as not to create a plastic zone \n\ncapable of preventing cracks from growing. There may also be observed a general tendency \n\nfor increased spread of results as temperature rises, which can be attributed to the influence of \n\ntemperature on the material micro-structure, exacerbating its flaws, e.g., porosity and lack of \n\nhomogeneity, that have an impact on its mechanical properties. In addition, as \n\naforementioned, it is possible to note that dwell loadings are more detrimental in that they \n\ngive rise to other phenomena, which interact during tests due to long plateau periods, causing \n\ncrack growth rates to rise. \n\n \n\n\n\n176 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 87: Comparative graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity \nfactor variation (  ) at 75\u00b0C, 120\u00b0C, 200\u00b0C, and 280\u00b0C and under sinusoidal wave and dwell \nloadings. \n\n \n\nFigure 88 presents the comparative graph of displacement in relation to time for \n\nfatigue crack propagation tests at 120\u00b0C and 280\u00b0C under trapezoidal wave loading and load \n\ncontrol. Piston displacement analysis (LVDT) of the mechanical testing machine (MTS) was \n\nconducted, but not of deformation measured by extensometer because of difficulties in \n\ncoupling it to specimens. This type of analysis can be performed with no detriment to result \n\nreliability because specimen stiffness is very small as compared to that of MTS. In order to \n\nplot this graph, points corresponding to loading and unloading ramps were suppressed; only \n\nplateau points were maintained so as to render it more clear and objective. \n\n \n\n\n\n177 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 88: Displacement vs. time graph for a crack propagation test at 120\u00b0C under dwell \n\nloading. \n\n \n\nFigure 88 shows the interaction of a phenomenon, distinct from mere fatigue crack \n\npropagation, at 280\u00b0C due to specimen elongation during the test conducted under load \n\ncontrol, i.e., kept constant throughout the plateau. This phenomenon, known as creep, \n\ninteracts during long plateau periods, causing the material to ?flow?. Therefore, cracks \n\npropagate due to interaction between fatigue and creep, i.e., not only due to fatigue as in the \n\ncase of sinusoidal wave loading. Creep may influence both crack initiation and growth \n\nbecause creep damage is manifested by cavity nucleation in grain boundaries due to \n\ncoalescing voids, stacking dislocations, and sliding grain boundaries. The same can happen to \n\nsecond-phase particles. Subsequent growth of these cavities is conducive to grain-boundary \n\ncracking and inter-granular fracture. Under static loading, failure is established by \n\ncatastrophic fracture when cavities coalesce. On the other hand, at 120\u00b0C, it is not possible to \n\ndraw any conclusions about this type of interaction, visible at 280\u00b0C, because the small \n\nmagnitude of displacement can be attributed to compliance, i.e., to the opening of the crack \n\n?mouth? as it propagates through the material. \n\nThe fracture surface analyses were performed using a SEM microscope. \n\nUnfortunately, this equipment does not allow observation of details of plastic deformation \n\nmicromechanisms that may took place at high temperature. Therefore, it was used a \n\ndeformation map generally obtained for Al and presented in Roesler et al (2007) to guide the \n\n\n\n178 \n\n \n\ndiscussion. From the Figures presented here it was not possible to clearly define the acting \n\nmicromechanisms, however significant changing may be observed when the tests were \n\nconducted under strain or load control and changing in temperature.  \n\nFigure 91(a) and (b) present the fracture surface analysis from a specimen submitted to \n\nfatigue at 120\u00baC and dwell cycles in load control. From Figure 91 (a) it is seen the notch, the \n\nregions of stable (fatigue precrack and fatigue at high temperature) and final fracture after \n\nsoaking in liquid nitrogen and submitted to static loading. In the region of stable crack \n\ngrowth, it was observed that the micromechanism was by fatigue mainly, with formation of \n\nstriations. Besides, it was also observed cast defects on the crack growth path, which may acts \n\nas internal crack nucleation sites (very rough surface). Even considering the large dwell time, \n\nthere was not clear signal of crack propagation by creep due to the testing temperature being \n\nonly 120\u00baC. Analogously to the deformation at low temperature, creep deformation can also \n\noccur by dislocation movement in metal. But there is one crucial difference: if an edge \n\ndislocation encounters an obstacle, a precipitate for example, it needs a certain minimal stress \n\nto overcome the obstacle at low temperatures; if an edge dislocation encounters an obstacle at \n\nhigher temperature, the dislocation can evade the obstacle by adding or emitting vacancies \n\n(Figure 89) and then the dislocation can leave its original slip plane. However, from the \n\ngraphic presented in Roesler et al (Figure 90), for this temperature two micromechanisms may \n\ncause plastic deformation, one time independent called dislocation glide and other by creep \n\ndenominated of dislocation creep. At low external stresses and at low temperature, the \n\nmaterial deforms elastically. At higher temperatures, diffusion creep starts, being stronger at \n\nsmall stresses then dislocation creep because of its lower creep exponent. Because of the \n\nlower activation energy for grain boundary diffusion, this mechanism is more important than \n\nbulk diffusion at low temperature. Since the creep exponent is the same in both cases, the tow \n\nregions are separated by a vertical line. The final fracture performed under static load and \n\nafter soaking in liquid nitrogen, shows a mixture of ductile and brittle fracture (Figure 91c). \n\nFigure 91(c) and (d) shows SEM analysis from a specimen tested by fatigue at 120\u00baC, \n\nsinusoidal wave shape in load control (10 Hz frequency).

However, the high frequency did \n\nnot allow the creep micromechanism being clearly active, and crack propagation was mainly \n\nby fatigue.

Among the various problems encountered \n\nduring this study, the most relevant are inadequacy of available and tested methods for \n\nmeasuring crack progress, long duration of tests (approximately one month each), and lack of \n\nhomogeneity and high porosity of the material under study. \n\nWith respect to measuring crack growth, as stated earlier, this study opted for the \n\npotential-drop method. This decision was made after trying other methods and finding them to \n\nbe inefficient. However, despite being the most suitable method among those available, the \n\npotential drop method is inadequate when some parameters, such as long testing time and the \n\neffects of thermal expansion produced by temperature variation intensified by in-phase \n\nmechanical loading, come into play. This occurs because small cracks appear in the region \n\nwhere the specimen is joined, by means of spot welding, with the wires employed to pass \n\nelectric current, causing them to detach from the specimen after a few hundred cycles. In \n\norder to solve this problem, other methods of joining as well as other types of wire were tried. \n\nHowever, due to the specimen geometry, these other methods also proved inadequate. \n\n\n\n192 \n\n \n\nMoreover, the potential-drop method proved inadequate when thermal loading is done via \n\ninduction coils, necessary in order to have plausible heating and cooling times. The electric \n\ncurrent passing through the coils induces Foucault current in the wires used by the potential \n\ndrop, generating large oscillation (noise) in measured values. \n\nThe long testing times (approximately one month each) were shown to be inadequate \n\nin that several external factors come into play, e.g., climate, energy drop, temperature \n\nvariation throughout the day, and may even bring about unexpected test breaks, which can \n\ngenerate specimen overloading and, thus, invalidate the test. \n\nAs regards the material under study, its lack of homogeneity and high porosity can \n\nproduce secondary cracking beyond the notch, causing the specimen to rupture outside the \n\nmeasurement region. In addition, due to long loading times (e.g., approximately ten minutes \n\nper cycle), this peculiarity of the material microstructure is aggravated by the synergy \n\nbetween high temperature and maximum load (in-phase anisothermal case), giving rise to \n\nother phenomena, e.g. creep, which interact with the propagation of fatigue cracks. \n\nFigure 95a shows the notch as well as the pre-crack (indicated by red arrows) of the \n\nspecimen used in the fatigue crack propagation test at room temperature. Figure 95b shows \n\nthe specimen after a few weeks of test under in-phase anisothermal loading. The loading \n\ndirection is shown by black arrows. As may be noticed, the fatigue pre-crack front has \n\nundergone significant rounding, indicating how the specimen crept. It is also possible to \n\nobserve cavity nucleation at grain boundaries due to coalescing vacancies, stacking \n\ndislocations, and sliding grain boundaries. This may happen with second phase particles as \n\nwell. Subsequent growth of these cavities leads to grain boundary cracking, which produces \n\nmicro-voids, as indicated by blue arrows along the loading line. \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 95: Photograph of specimen used for fatigue crack propagation testing showing (a) the \n\nregion of the notch and pre-crack at room temperature and (b) tentative tests under \n\n?? ?? \n?? ?? \n\n\n\n193 \n\n \n\nanisothermal loading. \n\n \n\n6.2 Computational Results \n\n \n\n6.2.1 Monotonic Loading (Tensile Test) \n\n \n\nA finite element analysis was carried out to model the material mechanical behavior. \n\nAfter trying several software programs available on the market, ABAQUS STANDARD \n\nFINITE ELEMENT CODE was chosen because of its accepting new models and algorithms \n\nas subroutine. \n\nThe study began with an elastic model of material behavior for the modeling of a \n\nspecimen of geometry similar to those tested experimentally for stress and fatigue. Data for \n\nthe material properties measured in these tests were entered at the software pre-processing \n\nphase. The same was done with loading and boundary conditions. The load vs. strain curves \n\nobtained experimentally provided the 0.2 creep limit in accordance with ASTM-E8/2009. The \n\nstrain measured by the extensometer was converted into displacement, since the initial \n\nspecimen length and length of the area measured by the extensometer are known, i.e., L0 = \n\n106mm and L0 = 12mm, respectively. This displacement was applied to the model, which \n\nprovided the load required. In the resolution phase of the ?solver? algorithm, a finite element \n\n(FE) series of the software was tested, which indicated that C3D8R (C = continuous \n\nstress/displacement, 3D = tri-dimensional, R = reduced integration) was the most suitable \n\nelement to start this study. Results regarding displacement, strain, and Von Mises stress were \n\nobtained in the post-processing phase (Figure 96). \n\n \n\n\n\n194 \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 96: Modeling results of strain specimen at room temperature in terms of (a) \n\ndisplacement, (b) deformation, and (c) Von Mises stress. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n195 \n\n \n\nIt is possible to observe that the useful region of the specimen is the one subjected to \n\nthe greatest efforts. Therefore, modeling was carried out only on this roughly 12mm-long \n\nregion, which corresponds exactly to the region being measured by the extensometer, thus \n\nobtaining more accurate results than previous ones (Figure 97). \n\n \n\nFigure 97: Von Mises stress results of modeling on useful region of strain specimen at room \n\ntemperature. \n\n \n\nAs might be expected, if the deformation measured by the extensometer is applied to a \n\nsmall region of the specimen with smaller cross-section than those of the remainder regions, \n\nin the whole specimen L0 = 106mm, it will be subject to higher stresses than under real-life \n\nconditions and, thus, erroneous. \n\nIn order to compare experimental and computational results, loading vs. deformation \n\ncurves were plotted for the elastic region at 25\u00b0C, 120\u00b0C, and 280\u00b0C (Figure 98, Figure 99 \n\nand Figure 100). \n\n \n\n\n\n196 \n\n \n\n0,000 0,005 0,010 0,015 0,020 0,025\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n  = 0,00295 mm/mm\n\nP= 3,66 kN\n\nTensile Test at 25\u00b0C\n\n \n\n \n\nP\n [\n\nk\nN\n\n]\n\n  [mm/mm]\n\n Alloy\n\n \n\n0,000 0,001 0,002 0,003\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n \n\nTensile Test at 25\u00b0C\n\n \n\n \n\n   [mm/mm]\n\nP\n [\nk\nN\n\n]\n\n Experimental\n\n Computational\n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 98: Tensile tests at 25\u00b0C: (a) loading as a function of total strain and 0.2 yield point; \n\n(b) comparison between experimental and computational curves for elastic region. \n\n0,000 0,005 0,010 0,015 0,020 0,025 0,030 0,035\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n  = 0,0041656 mm/mm\n\nP= 4,3105 kN\n\nTensile Test at 120\u00b0C\n\nP\n [\n\nk\nN\n\n]\n\n  [mm/mm]\n\n \n\n \n\n Alloy\n\n \n\n0,000 0,001 0,002 0,003 0,004\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\nTensile Test at 120\u00b0C\n\n Experimental\n\n Computational\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nP\n [\nk\nN\n\n]\n\n  [mm/mm]\n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 99: Tensile tests at 120\u00b0C: (a) loading as a function of total strain and 0.2 yield point; \n\n(b) comparison between experimental and computational curves for elastic region. \n\n0,000 0,005 0,010 0,015 0,020 0,025\n0,0\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\n2,0\n\n2,5\n\n3,0\n\n  = 0,00369 mm/mm\n\nP= 2,239 kN\n\nTensile Test at 280\u00b0C\n\nP\n [\n\nk\nN\n\n]\n\n  [mm/mm]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Alloy\n\n \n\n0,000 0,001 0,002 0,003 0,004\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\nTensile Test at 280\u00b0C\n\n Experimental\n\n Computational\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nP\n [\nk\nN\n\n]\n\n  [mm/mm]\n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 100: Tensile tests at 280\u00b0C: (a) loading as a function of total strain and 0.2 yield point; \n\n\n\n197 \n\n \n\n(b) comparison between experimental and computational curves for elastic region. \n\n \n\nIt is possible to see a great difference between experimental and computational results. \n\nThis is due to the fact that the adopted creep limit, in accordance with ASTM E8/2009, is not \n\nsuitable for the type of response provided by the material under study.

This is because mechanical properties are assumed \n\n\n\n199 \n\n \n\nhomogeneous throughout the specimen. However, they can vary from region to region, \n\nsignaling the need to adapt the material model, taking into account its microstructure \n\nheterogeneity, so that modeling results are as close to reality as possible. Furthermore, when \n\napplying the model to the real component, MAGMA software simulation should be employed \n\nto provide data of physical and mechanical properties, thereby ensuring that its mechanical \n\nand physical behavior as a whole is taken into consideration. This indicates the need to adapt a \n\nmaterial model so that modeling results are as close to reality as possible. \n\n \n\n6.2.2 Cyclic Loading (Fatigue Test) \n\n \n\n6.2.2.1 Identification of Material Behavior Law Parameters \n\n \n\nSince the material cyclic behavior is the only way into the incremental model of crack \n\npropagation under fatigue (Pommier S., Risbet M., 2005), the correct identification of the \n\nmaterial behavior law and its parameters is of fundamental importance to describe plasticity in \n\nthe region immediately ahead of the crack tip and all its related phenomena. The identification \n\nof the material behavior was done by means of isothermal fatigue and relaxation tests \n\ndescribed in Sections 6.1.2.2 e 6.1.2.4.  \n\nFinite Element Modeling of this behavior will then allow the identification of the eight \n\nmaterial parameters of cracked structure behavior. In this case Chaboche law is used with \n\ncombined nonlinear kinematic hardening (X) and nonlinear isotropic hardening (R). Kinematic \n\nhardening evolution is given by: \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n                             (58) \n\n \n\nwhereas isotropic evolution is given by: \n\n \n\n                           (59) \n\n \n\nwhere   is accumulated plastic deformation given by: \n\n \n\n\n\n200 \n\n \n\n    \n \n\n \n             \n\n \n\n   \n\n   (60) \n\n \n\nand the viscous component is given by the Norton-Hoff law: \n\n \n\n        \n  (61) \n\n \n\nand therefore, the total strain is given by: \n\n \n\n                   (62) \n\n \n\nA Finite Element simulation was conducted by ABAQUS to identify the material \n\nbehavior law parameters. The dimensions correspond to the useful region of the specimen \n\nemployed in the fatigue test. The axisymmetric model was used, with calculations performed \n\nunder plane strain (Figure 105). \n\n \n\n   \n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 105: Axisymmetric model employed to identify the behavior law parameters of the \n\nmaterial in question: (a) and (b) boundary conditions; and (c) Finite Element mesh  \n\n \n\nTable 9 shows the behavior parameters identified for the material under study. \n\nComparison between the experimental hysteresis and that obtained computationally under \n\n\n\n201 \n\n \n\nisothermal and thermo-mechanical loading conditions (Figure 106, Figure 107 and Figure \n\n108) shows that the chosen parameters satisfactorily agree with experimental results. It was \n\nalso noted that when viscous behavior comes into play (Figure 109), discrepancies between \n\nthe model and experimental results are more pronounced.

This is done by a Finite Element (FE) calculation \n\non a cracked plate. The plate dimensions are              and a central crack of length \n\n\n\n204 \n\n \n\n        . Calculations are performed under plane strain using the behavior identified for \n\nthe material in question. The plate is subjected to 30 loading and unloading cycles in order to \n\nachieve a stabilized cycle for the cyclic part (Figure 110). \n\n \nFigure 110: Finite Element calculation performed to identify plastic blunting law parameters. \n\n \n\nThe identification of parameters   ,   ,    , and     is accomplished by plotting the \n\nevolution of plastic blunting as a function of the stress intensity factor applied (Figure 111). \n\nThe identification of    and    is done during the first loading cycle and of      and     \n\nduring the last unloading cycle. The parameters are then calculated by the smallest square \n\nmethod. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 111: Identification of parameters   ,   ,    , and    . \n\n \n\nThe identification of parameter     is done by plotting the evolution of contact point \n\n    in the first loading cycle as a function of plastic blunting. The evolution of parameter \n\n    as function of plastic blunting is linear and described by the following equation: \n\n \n\n              (64) \n\n \n\nVia the smallest square method, it is possible to determine the angular coefficient of \n\nthe line    , i.e., the slope of curve         (Figure 112). The identification of    is done by \n\n\n\n205 \n\n \n\nplotting the evolution of corresponding plastic strain as a function of distance   from the crack \n\ntip during loading. Just the first curve points are employed in the calculation. Parameters    \n\nand    are estimated from the contact point evolution as a function of crack length. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 112: Identification of parameters    ,   ,   , and   . \n\n \n\nFinite Element calculations and procedures to identify plastic blunting law parameters \n\nwere carried out by ABAQUS, which took a couple of hours. The parameters obtained for the \n\nmaterial under study, i.e., A356 aluminum alloy used in the manufacture of automotive engine \n\ncylinder heads, are shown in Table 10.

These tests were carried out \n\nby a mechanical testing machine (Figure 53) on specimens with corner cracks (Figure 52b) \n\nand loading rate       (shown in Section 6.1.2.5). Figure 113 presents the fatigue crack \n\npropagation curve at       plotted in a Paris diagram. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 113: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor \nvariation (  ) at 120\u00b0C and under sinusoidal wave loadings at frequency of 10 Hz.  \n \n\nParameter   exerts influence only on the Paris curve level at constant amplitude and \n\nvery little on its slope. In fact, the crack propagation rate is directly proportional to the plastic \n\nblunting rate. Thus, when   is altered, just the position of the propagation curve in the Paris \n\ndiagram changes whereas its slope remains constant. The Paris curve slope derives directly \n\nfrom the plastic blunting law. Thus, accurate identification of the material behavior law \n\nparameters and, consequently, blunting law parameters is fundamental for the Paris exponent \n\n  to be represented correctly. Therefore, in order to identify  , an initial simulation is \n\n\n\n207 \n\n \n\nperformed by adopting its value as equal to 1 (one). Its exact value is then deducted from the \n\nrelationship between the simulated rate and experimental rate for a same level of     . \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n208 \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe material studied in this work is an A356 Al alloy, used to produce engine cylinder \n\nheads for the automotive industry by die casting process. The chemical analysis has shown \n\nthat some chemical elements were a slight difference from the nominal values (Fe and Si), as \n\nwell as the EDX analysis, from specific areas, showed that the cast presented some lack of \n\nhomogeneity. \n\nFrom microstructural analisys it was observed a quite coarse dentrite microstructure in \n\na eutectic matrix, with a mean SDAS of 25 ?m, intemetallic precipitates and porosities (mean \n\ndiameter size of 50 ?m and maximum size of 500 ?m).  \n\nAs expected, the tensile properties were strongly affected by testing temperature (RT \n\ntill 280 \no\nC), with a quite sensitive drop of E (63 to 45 GPa),  y (124 to 80 MPa) and  u (212 to \n\n81 MPa) as the temperature was raised.  \n\nConsidering the isothermal fatigue tests at 120 and 280 \no\nC, under strain control, it was \n\nobserved that as the temperature raised from 120 to 280 \no\nC, life dropped markedly \n\n(approximately 10 times). This was due to the material has became less resitant to plastic \n\ndeformation and defects were intensified. From the stabilized hysteresis loop it was possible \n\nto observe the difference in the mentioned ductility, as well as, that at 120 \no\nC, during testing, \n\nthe A356 Al alloy ?cyclic hardens? while at 280\n o\nC ?cyclically softens?. \n\nFrom the themomechanical in-phase tests, with temperature varying from (120 to 280 \n\no\nC), it was possible to observe that life is quite similar to the isothermal fatigue test at 280 \n\no\nC. \n\nIn this case, the more sensitive damage caused the in-phase mechanical and thermal cycle take \n\nplace at the highest temperature. In time, both hysteresis are quite similar in shape, with some \n\ndifferences due to the fact that the thermomechanical cycle is slower (0.003 Hz) than the \n\nisothermal cycle (0.1 Hz), allowing some stress relaxation (reducing the maximum stress \n\nlevel). \n\nRelaxation tests indicated two distinct behaviors, with the temperature of 240\u00b0C being \n\na threshold. At lower temperatures, the material hardens cyclically whereas it softens \n\ncyclically at higher temperatures. This behavior is similar to the one observed during the \n\nisothermal fatigue tests. As the tests are carried out in strain control, during the dwell the \n\nstress is relaxed, reducing the elastic component of strain and at same time increasing the \n\nplastic component. It was observed that as the test temperature is increased, the amount of \n\nstress relaxed increases. \n\n \n\n\n\n209 \n\n \n\nFrom the fatigue crack growth results, it was observed that temperature and wave \n\nshape has a strong influence on the crack growth rate as well as on the stress intensity \n\nthreshold. Considering sinusoidal wave shape (10 Hz), as the temperature increased the  Kth \n\ndecreased and the crack propagation rate increased (for a constant  K). However, the rate as \n\nda/dN change with temperature is quite similar, as an indicative that the micromechanism of \n\ncrack growth has not changed due to the high frequency used, and it was due only to loss of \n\nmechanical strength. \n\nConsidering a constant temperature (120 and 280\u00b0C) and stress controlled test, \n\nchanging the wave shape from sinusoidal to 3 min dwell at maximum load, the crack \n\npropagation rate has increased of approximately 100 times, showing a strong contribution of \n\ncreep on the crack propagation process, with the amount of creep contribution dependent on \n\ntemperature, it being higher as higher is the temperature.  \n\nConsidering a constant temperature (280\u00b0C), strain controlled test and the  3 min dwell \n\nat maximum load, it was observed that the rate of da/dN with  K become almost constant, due \n\nto stress relaxation. \n\nIt has noticed that is quite difficult to obtain, for the casting material studied in this \n\nwork, the mechanical behavior parameters, since there is a noticiable discrepancy amount the \n\nspecimens tested. However, it was shown for the examples presented here, that the model was \n\nable to reproduce, with a reasonable approximation, the stress \u2013 strain relationship at different \n\ntemperatures, for the isothermal and anysothermal cases. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n210 \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAMERICAN SOCIETY FOR METALS \u2013 ASM (1997), ASM Handbook, Volume 19: \n\nFatigue and Fracture ASM International, ISBN: 0871703858, Pages: 1057. \n\nAMERICAN SOCIETY FOR METALS \u2013 ASM (2000), Metals Handbook Volume 8: \n\nMechanical Testing and Evaluation Publisher: ASM International; 10 edition \n\n(September 2000), English, ISBN: 0871703890, 10th Edition, 2235 pages.
