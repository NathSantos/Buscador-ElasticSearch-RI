However, some of the sites referred in this work should be simply attributed to the\nMiddle Paleolithic due to the lack of detailed elements. The site of Vale do Forno 8 probably represents the transition between\nthe final Upper Paleolithic and the early Middle Paleolithic.\n\nThe open-air sites such as the ones in the outskirts of Lisbon and on the left margin of the Tagus estuary, where vestiges\nare extremely abundant and the permanence for long periods correspond to sites of residential character.\n\nNone of these sites were subject to extensive excavations in order to confirm this type of settlement and further knowledge\nof the social organization of the inhabited spaces. Other open-air sites located in fluvial terraces present smaller areas of occupa-\ntion and were probably related to game activities, maybe seasonal in nature. This was the case of Santo Ant\u00e3o do Tojal, were\nelephants and horses were eventually captured, of Foz do Enxarrique were red deer was almost exclusive and of Vilas Ruivas,\nwere faunal remains were not preserved but remains of wind-breaks or hunting blind structures were found associated with fire-\nplaces and post-holes. Fireplaces were also found in Gruta da Buraca Escura and on the open-air site of Santa Cita.\n\nCaves such as Gruta da Oliveira and the Gruta Nova da Columbeira show long stratigraphic sequences and prolonged set-\ntlements, of residential type, though a few other caves also show temporary settlements related to game activities or the exploita-\ntion of geological resources. In most cases, there is an alternance of the cave occupation by humans and large carnivores. Food\nsubsistence of humans was non-specialized, capturing large, mid and also small preys such as the rabbit, an abundant endemic\nspecies. The terrestrial turtle was also captured, especially in Gruta Nova da Columbeira. Aquatic resources were a significative\npart of the food supply in caves close to the coast such as Ibn Amar over the Arade estuary and Gruta da Figueira Brava, over\nthe sea, where a lot of different species of mollucs, crustaceans and sea mammals such as seal and dolphin were present.\n\nIn the caves some few kilometers from the coast, like Gruta Nova da Columbeira, recollection or fishing activities were not\npresent. It means that the resource exploitation areas around the settlements were small. The same reasoning is applicable to\nthe geological resources, in which the raw materials such as quartz, quartzite and flint were used in quantities according to their\navailability in the surrounding cave area, never more than in a 10 km around the settlements. In some cases e.g. Gruta da\nFigueira Brava and Gruta do Escoural, filonean quartz was extensively used in spite of its bad quality because of its abundance\nin the cave surroundings. In Lisbon region, where the distance between sites did not surpasse 30 km, there is also a strong rela-\ntionship between the types of materials used and their availability, indicating the opportunistic and local origin of the produc-\ntion, even if mobility was high within each the exploited area.\n\nFrom both technical and typological points of view, the Final Mousterian represented by the assemblages of Gruta da\nOliveira, Gruta Nova da Columbeira and Gruta da Figueira Brava, showed no evidence of transition to the Upper Paleolithic\nbut rather a \u201cmousterianisation\u201d of the lithic industry was observed.\n\nThe food supplies used and the species captured reflected the paleoclimatic conditions that took place. The eldest materials\ndated Mousterian were collected in Gruta da Furninha, from ca. 80 Ka calBP, and are related to the stripped hyaena (Hyaena\nhyaena prisca), a species of warm climate coexisting with the warmwater species Patella safiana and Pectunculus bimaculatus\nwhich existed in the 5-8 m a.s.l. marine conglomerate level observed in Forte da Baralha, in the littoral of the Arr\u00e1bida Ridge.\nPresently these species do not occur at latitudes higher than the Mediterranean or the Atlantic Moroccan coast.\n\nAfter the formation of the fossil deposits of Gruta da Furninha, the palaeoclimatic evolution is not known until ca. 45\nKa calBP, represented by the palaeontological sites of Vale de Janela in the Estremadura littoral and S\u00e3o Torpes in the Alente-\njo littoral. In both sites there were found species related to a cool and wet temperate climate, but Myrica also occurs, a ter-\nmophilic genus. A climate cooler than the Mediterranean is in agreement with the presence of the mountain goat in the\nupper Mousterian levels of gruta da Oliveira dating before 43/42 Ka calBP. Afterwards, the climate became progressively\nwarmer and Mediterranean-type: the mountain goat disappeared from Gruta da Oliveira and Mediterranean rodents are present\nin the Level 8 of that cave, dating from 38/37 Ka calBP, while Cepaea nemoralis appeared in Lapa dos Furos, dating from 40\nKa calBP.\n\nFrom 36 Ka calBP on, there was a climatic cooling and the mountain goat reappears in low altitude mountain ranges\n(Gruta Nova da Columbeira and Gruta da Figueira Brava). In fact, the weather conditions were probably cooler than in the\npresent and comparable to those in the cantabrian region, as suggested by the findings in Gruta da Figueira Brava. But the pre-\nsence of the land turtle, which was abundant in Gruta Nova da Columbeira (up to 34-31 Ka calBP) demands summer temper-\natures ca. 20-30 \u00baC for egg hatching. On the other hand, the microfauna from Level K in Gruta do Caldeir\u00e3o, including\nAllocricetus bursae, shows how steppic conditions migrated to the western part of the Iberian Peninsula and prevailed when the\nfirst industries of the Upper Paleolithic occurred, an evolved phase of the Aurignacian, about probably 35-34 Ka calBP.\n\nWithin this particular paleoclimatic framework of the western and southwestern parts of the Peninsula, it is possible to\naccept the survival of population remains of some species including the ancient elephant which is present in Foz do Enxarrique\nabout 33.6 Ka calBP, and also the last Neanderthals and their Late Mousterian industry.\n\nKey words: Climate. Chronology. Lithic assemblages. Mousterian. Portugal.\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn order to understand the human presence in pres-\nent-day Portuguese territory corresponding to the Mous-\nterian complex \u2013the only cultural complex from the Mid-\ndle Paleolithic so far recognised and characterised in the\n\nPortuguese territory (Bicho, 2004)\u2013 whose terminus has\nbeen verified at roughly 35/34 Ka calBP years, a limit\ngenerally accepted nowadays (Table 1), it is important to\nbegin with a brief description of the most important sites\nthat have been identified up to now (Fig. 1).

Alguns\ndos conjuntos industriais referidos neste trabalho foram, contudo, inclu\u00eddos na designa\u00e7\u00e3o mais gen\u00e9rica de Paleol\u00edtico M\u00e9dio,\npor falta de elementos de pormenor.\n\nAs esta\u00e7\u00f5es de ar livre referenciadas parecem corporizar, nuns casos, face \u00e0 enorme quantidade de vest\u00edgios, estacionamentos\nintensivos e prolongados, de tipo residencial, favorecidos pela abund\u00e2ncia de mat\u00e9rias-primais dispon\u00edveis. \u00c9 o caso das esta\u00e7\u00f5es\ndos arredores de Lisboa e das existentes na margem esquerda do estu\u00e1rio do Tejo. Nenhuma foi objecto de escava\u00e7\u00f5es em\nextens\u00e3o, impossibilitando a confirma\u00e7\u00e3o desta situa\u00e7\u00e3o, por um lado e, por outro, o conhecimento da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o interna do\nespa\u00e7o habitado. Outras esta\u00e7\u00f5es de ar livre, implantadas em terra\u00e7os fluviais, ocupam \u00e1reas menores e configuram actividades\ncineg\u00e9ticas especializadas, talvez de car\u00e1cter sazonal: \u00e9 o caso de Santo Ant\u00e3o do Tojal, onde provavelmente se capturou o\nelefante, da Foz do Enxarrique, especializada na ca\u00e7a ao veado e de Vilas Ruivas, onde os restos faun\u00edsticos n\u00e3o se conservaram.\nNaquela \u00faltima esta\u00e7\u00e3o, foram identificadas estruturas habitacionais, atribu\u00eddas a p\u00e1ra-ventos (wind-breaks), ou a tapumes de\nca\u00e7a (hunting-blinds), associadas a lareiras e a poss\u00edveis buracos de poste; estes testemunhos juntam-se \u00e0s lareiras identificadas na\nGruta da Buraca Escura e no s\u00edtio de ar livre de Santa Cita.\n\nAs grutas revelam por vezes estratigrafias extensas, denunciando perman\u00eancias prolongadas e recorrentes, o que configura a\nsitua\u00e7\u00e3o de corresponderem a s\u00edtios de tipo residencial, sem preju\u00edzo de tamb\u00e9m se conhecerem grutas com ocupa\u00e7\u00f5es epis\u00f3dicas,\nrelacionadas com actividades cineg\u00e9ticas ou de explora\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos geol\u00f3gicos. A Gruta da Oliveira e a Gruta Nova da\nColumbeira est\u00e3o no primeiro caso. Evidencia-se a altern\u00e2ncia da sua ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o por carn\u00edvoros e pelo homem. A variedade dos\nrecursos cineg\u00e9ticos identificados mostra uma economia de subsist\u00eancia n\u00e3o especializada, capturando-se presas de grande, m\u00e9dio\ne pequeno porte. Entre as \u00faltimas encontra-se o coelho, esp\u00e9cie end\u00e9mica, ent\u00e3o muito abundante, cuja ca\u00e7a era acompanhada\npela da tartaruga terrestre, a qual atinge express\u00e3o significativa na Gruta Nova da Columbeira. Os recursos aqu\u00e1ticos constitu\u00edam\nparte significativa da dieta em grutas pr\u00f3ximo do litoral, como a Gruta de Ibn Amar, sobre o estu\u00e1rio actual do rio Arade e a\nGruta da Figueira Brava. Nesta \u00faltima, a import\u00e2ncia desse contributo alimentar \u00e9 evidenciada pela diversidade e abund\u00e2ncia\ndas esp\u00e9cies de moluscos identificados, acompanhados de crust\u00e1ceos e at\u00e9 de mam\u00edferos marinhos, como a foca e o golfinho.\n\nO facto de a componente de pesca e recolec\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o se ter reconhecido em grutas fora da linha de costa actual evidencia a\n\u00e1rea relativamente limitada de capta\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos inerente a cada gruta, sem preju\u00edzo de os seus habitantes, dentro dos\nrespectivos territ\u00f3rios, conhecerem um alto grau de mobilidade, o qual \u00e9 sublinhado pela diversidade de recursos explorados.\nEsta situa\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m se aplica \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos geol\u00f3gicos. Com efeito, nota-se que as mat\u00e9rias-primas mais utilizadas,\ns\u00e3o o quartzo, o quartzito e o s\u00edlex, em percentagens vari\u00e1veis consoante a sua pr\u00f3pria disponibilidade na envolv\u00eancia imediata\ndas grutas, n\u00e3o ultrapassando um raio superior a 10 km. Noutros casos, como na Gruta da Figueira Brava e na Gruta do\nEscoural, observou-se uma incid\u00eancia muito forte na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do quartzo filoneano, apesar da sua m\u00e1 qualidade, em virtude de\nser a rocha dispon\u00edvel no territ\u00f3rio adjacente.\n\nDo ponto de vista tecnol\u00f3gico e tipol\u00f3gico, os tr\u00eas conjuntos reconhecidamente datados do Mustierense Final do territ\u00f3rio\nportugu\u00eas mais importantes: Gruta da Oliveira; Gruta Nova da Columbeira e Gruta da Figueira Brava, n\u00e3o evidenciam qualquer\nind\u00edcio de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o para ind\u00fastrias do Paleol\u00edtico Superior notando-se, ao contr\u00e1rio, um refor\u00e7o das suas caracter\u00edsticas\nmustierenses.\n\nOs mais antigos materiais mustierenses estratigrafados prov\u00eam da Gruta da Furninha, datados de ca. 80 Ka calBP,\nencontrando-se associados a hiena raiada (Hyaena hyaena prisca). Trata-se de esp\u00e9cie de clima quente, j\u00e1 ent\u00e3o uma rel\u00edquia a\nn\u00edvel europeu, compat\u00edvel com a ocorr\u00eancia, no cord\u00e3o conglomer\u00e1tico formado ao longo do litoral da serra da Arr\u00e1bida a 5-8\nm de altitude, contempor\u00e2neo daquele dep\u00f3sito, de Patella safiana, esp\u00e9cie de \u00e1guas quentes, que actualmente n\u00e3o ultrapassa a\nlatitude do litoral atl\u00e2ntico marroquino, acompanhada de Pectunculus bimaculatus, de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o mediterr\u00e2nea.\n\nDesconhece-se a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o paleoclim\u00e1tica entre a \u00e9poca de forma\u00e7\u00e3o do dep\u00f3sito fossil\u00edfero da Furninha e cerca de 45 Ka\ncalBP. Tal \u00e9 a cronologia obtida pelo radiocarbono para as jazidas de interesse paleontol\u00f3gico de Vale de Janela, no litoral da\nEstremadura e de S\u00e3o Torpes, no litoral alentejano. Apesar de existirem em ambas as jazidas esp\u00e9cies de clima temperado mais\nfresco e h\u00famido que o mediterr\u00e2nico, \u00e9 de salientar a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do g\u00e9nero Myrica, de caracter\u00edsticas term\u00f3filas. Com efeito, a\ntend\u00eancia para um clima temperado fresco \u00e9 compat\u00edvel, para a referida \u00e9poca, com a presen\u00e7a de cabra mont\u00eas nos n\u00edveis\nmustierenses inferiores da Gruta da Oliveira, anteriores a 43/42 Ka calBP. A partir desta \u00e9poca o clima parece tormar-se\nprogressivamente mais quente, assumindo caracter\u00edsticas mediterr\u00e2neas: tal \u00e9 indicado pelo desaparecimento da cabra mont\u00eas na\nGruta da Oliveira, acompanhada (N\u00edvel 8) de associa\u00e7\u00e3o de roedores de caracter\u00edsticas mediterr\u00e2neas datada de ca. 38/37 Ka\ncalBP, compat\u00edvel com a presen\u00e7a de Cepaea nemoralis na Lapa dos Furos, ca. de 40 Ka calBP.\n\nA partir de 36 Ka calBP as condi\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas parecem modificar-se progressivamente no sentido do arrefecimento: a\ncabra mont\u00eas reaparece nas cadeias montanhosas atl\u00e2nticas de baixa altitude (Gruta Nova da Columbeira e Gruta da Figueira\nBrava); o arrefecimento clim\u00e1tico, corresponde a condi\u00e7\u00f5es um pouco mais frias que as existentes actualmente na zona, mas\ncompar\u00e1veis \u00e0s do litoral cant\u00e1brico, \u00e9 comprovado pelo conjunto de indicadores dispon\u00edveis na Gruta da Figueira Brava, o mais\ncompleto at\u00e9 ao presente reunido. Mas a presen\u00e7a, at\u00e9 ca. 34-31 Ka calBP, na Gruta Nova da Columbeira, da tartaruga terrestre,\nesp\u00e9cie ali abundante, que requeria temperaturas da ordem dos 20 a 30 graus cent\u00edgrados ao longo do Ver\u00e3o, para a incuba\u00e7\u00e3o\ndos ovos, indica que o arrefecimento clum\u00e1tico n\u00e3o poderia ter sido muito acentuado. Por outro lado, a microfauna do N\u00edvel K\nda gruta do Caldeir\u00e3o, com Allocricetus bursae, demonstra a progress\u00e3o at\u00e9 ao ocidente peninsular das condi\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e9picas cerca\nde 35 Ka calBP. Tais condi\u00e7\u00f5es prevaleciam aquando do surgimento na regi\u00e3o, talvez ca. 35-34 Ka calBP, das primeiras ind\u00fastrias\ndo Paleol\u00edtico Superior, pertencentes j\u00e1 a um est\u00e1dio evolu\u00eddo do Aurignacense.\n\n\u00c9 neste quadro paleoclim\u00e1tico particular ao ocidente e sudoeste peninsular que se devem entender sobreviv\u00eancias tardias de\ncertas esp\u00e9cies, como o elefante antigo, presente na Foz do Enxarrique cerca de 33,6 Ka calBP o qual, oferecendo condi\u00e7\u00f5es\ngeogr\u00e1ficas favor\u00e1veis, favoreceu tamb\u00e9m a tardia presen\u00e7a dos \u00faltimos Neandertais e, com eles, do Mustierense Final no\nterrit\u00f3rio portugu\u00eas.\n\nPalavras chaves: Clima.

Two main reasons lay behind this: on\nthe one hand, the impossibility of carrying out lengthy\nand systematic explorations of caves due to the lack of\navailable and suitably qualified archaeologists and, on the\nother hand, the lack of funding meant that researchers\ncould not be trained who could then, in collaboration\nwith specialists from other countries, establish an area of\nresearch, as had been the case in Spain. From the begin-\nning of the 20th. century until the start of the 1960s, the\nstudy of Middle Paleolithic materials in Portugal was\ntherefore restricted to the results of surface collections,\ninvolving low investment and a methodology that any\n\namateur could learn in a few hours. This happened with\nthe rich Paleolithic sites on the outskirts of Lisbon, dis-\ncussed later, which were the object of intensive collecting\nfollowing the discovery of the famous site at Casal do\nMonte just outside Lisbon, in 1909, by Joaquim Fontes.\nThis approach to studying Paleolithic materials was boosted\nin the mid-1940s by the presence of H. Breuil in Portu-\ngal (between June 1941 and November 1942), legitimis-\ning this form of collecting with the adoption of a method\n\u2013the so-called \u201cseries method\u201d\u2013 that resolved the limita-\ntions arising out of a lack of stratigraphic information,\nbased as much on the typology as on the physical state of\nthe industry. Thus the greater the surface wear on the\nexamples, including the identification of the superimposi-\ntion of successive forms of erosion (e.g. water, wind), the\nolder the item was, based on the principle that all items\nwere affected by the same conditions since they had been\nabandoned on the surface. Without wishing to enter into\na discussion on the relative merits and limitations of these\ncriteria, which continued to be used in Portugal for the\nfollowing sixty years due to the work of G.

Radiometric results for the Musterian of Portugal (after Zilh\u00e3o, 2001, modified).\n\n\n\nthe 1980s, when a small group of researchers emerged\nwho, despite their different academic backgrounds, finally\nmanaged in various ways to harness the necessary funding\nfor extensive research into cave and open-air site deposits.\n\nIn spite of the scarcity of human resources, it is dur-\ning this period, spanning the last 25 years, that the most\n\nsignificant advances have been\nmade towards understanding the\nMiddle Paleolithic in Portugal,\nalthough this has been insepara-\nble from parallel research into\nthe Upper Paleolithic, bearing in\nmind that the sites were either\nthe same or were located in the\nsame geographical area, particu-\nlarly the Estremadura Limestone\nMassif and adjacent areas, where\nthere is an abundance of karst\ncaves, thus justifying combined\nresearch work.\n\nThe direct predecessor of\nthe studies currently being un-\ndertaken into the Middle Pa-\nleolithic period in Portugal was\nthe excavation of the Gruta das\nSalemas (Loures), followed by\nthat of the Gruta Nova da\nColumbeira (Bombarral), both\ncarried out by the staff of the\nServi\u00e7os Geol\u00f3gicos de Portugal at\nthe beginning of the 1960s. It\nwas the only official organisa-\ntion that had the necessary\nresources and technical means to\ncarry out such research, albeit in\na circumstantial and limited\nmanner since it was subordinat-\ned to geological work. Neverthe-\nless, it was the excavation of\nthese caves, due, in particular to\nthe work of O. da Veiga Fer-\nreira, which inaugurated the era\nof modern research into the\nMiddle and Upper Paleolithic\nin Portugal. The delay in fol-\nlowing-up the research explains\nthe long period before the\nappearance of the first summa-\nry on the Early and Middle Por-\ntuguese Paleolithic (Zby 74). A\nlater and more detailed summa-\nry appeared twenty years later\n(illustrating the rapid evolution\nof knowledge that had taken\nplace in the interim; Raposo,\n1993). Recently, the subject has\ninterested several researchers\n(Bicho, 2004; Zilhsa, 1992,\n2004, 2006; Cardoso, 2002).\n\n2.1.

The archaeological record\nFIG. 1. Location of the studied sites.\n\n\n\nof flint, occurring in the form of nodules in the hard Cre-\ntaceous limestone, enabled thousands of items to be\nchipped in workshops which operated throughout most\nof the Paleolithic period and extended into post-Paleolith-\nic times. However, successive quarrying of the Cretaceous\nlimestone in this region, especially after the great earth-\nquake of 1755, did away with most of the existing\nremains. The most substantial collections were found in\nthe vast basalt complex of Lisbon which extends almost\ncontinuously from the Cascais to the Loures region, form-\ning a long arc around the capital, with a greater concentra-\ntion of occurrences in the Amadora and Benfica regions.\nThe extensive Paleolithic area discovered in the region was\ntherefore named the Lisbon Paleolithic Volcanic Complex.\n\nIn 1932, A. do Pa\u00e7o (Pa\u00e7o, 1932) mapped out 94 Paleo-\nlithic sites surrounding the capital and the inventory was\nsubsequently updated but not significantly altered (Pa\u00e7o,\n1940; Jalhay &amp; Pa\u00e7o, 1941). Many of these sites (Fig. 2)\nhad been previously identified by Verg\u00edlio Correia and\nJoaquim Fontes who, in the same year but as the result of\nindependent work, presented the first summaries of these\nsites (Fontes, 1912; Correia, 1912), thus demonstrating\nthe Paleolithic richness of the region. Joaquim Fontes was\nalso responsible for identifying the first and certainly the\nmost important site in the region, Casal do Monte, in\n1909 (Fontes, 1910). He was also apparently the first per-\nson to use the term \u201cMousterian\u201d in Portugal (referring to\nthe \u201cMoustier epoch\u201d and \u201cMoustier type\u201d) in 1912 whilst\nstudying examples collected from sites on the outskirts of\nLisbon, stating that he was using the nomenclature of G.\nand A. de Mortillet. Encouraged by the interest his dis-\ncoveries aroused abroad, since little was known at the time\nabout the Portuguese Lower and Middle Paleolithic, in the\nsame year Joaquim Fontes presented the first summary on\nthe Mousterian period in Portugal (Fontes, 1913) at the\n8th session of the French Pre-Historic Conference held in\nAngoul\u00eame in 1912. In this study he classified the main\ntypes of Mousterian tools on the basis of collections he\nhad gathered from sites on the outskirts of Lisbon, descri-\nbing the Gruta da Furninha as the only known site of\nstratigraphic interest based on of the excavations carried\nout there by Nery Delgado in 1879.\n\nThe thousands of tools that had been previously been\nrecovered, considerably enlarged by their own collections\n(Fig. 3), were studied exhaustively by H. Breuil and G.\nZbyszewski as part of their systematic review of the Pale-\nolithic in the Lisbon region, thus identifying a long suc-\ncession of industry from the Lower Acheulean to post-\nPaleolithic times. This considerable industry is explained\nnot only by the broad diachronics of the succession, but\nalso by its geographical isolation, since it is associated with\na near peninsula bordered by the ocean in the west, the\nTejo estuary in the south and the Tejo valley in the east,\n\nand particularly by the availabil-\nity of raw material, essentially\nconsisting of Cretaceous flint\n(Fig. 4) and, to a lesser extent,\nquartz and quartzite pebbles from\nthe Plio-Pleistocene deposits that\nhave almost completely disap-\npeared today.\n\nBearing in mind the techni-\ncal and typological characteristics\nof the tools, the human presence\nmust have reached its peak dur-\ning the Mousterian age. At this\ntime, the region was, probably\ndensely covered with shrubs and\nintermittently surrounded by for-\nest areas, would have been a\ngood hunting ground, also due\nto the mild climate resulting\nfrom the low latitude and prox-\nimity to the coast. In fact, the\npredominance of open-air camps\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 25\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 2. General distribution of the Paleolithic sites located in \nLisbon outskirts (after Pa\u00e7o, 1940).\n\nFIG. 3. Collection of Paleolithic artefacts at Linda-a-Pastora (Oeiras), in Lisbon outskirts by H.\nBreuil and collaborators in 1941/1942 (after Cardoso, Zbyszewski &amp; Andr\u00e9, 1992).\n\n\n\nover cave dwellings, which were almost always sporadical-\nly distributed, indicates the existence of a generally benign\nclimate during most of the last glacial period.\n\nThe Paleolithic materials on the surface were so widely\ndispersed that the concentrations observed locally, all inva-\nriably lacking stratigraphic information, were denied the\nstatus of authentic archaeological sites by H. Breuil and G.\nZbyszewski as, in fact, they are not, in the traditional sense\nof the term, signifying the demarcated distribution of arte-\nfacts with a well-defined stratigraphic position: \u201cThese are\nwidely dispersed over all the surfaces that were investigated\nand, although denser in certain areas, were not really loca-\nted in authentic sites\u201d (Breuil &amp; Zbyszewski, 1942: 32).\n\nDue to gravity and post depositional mass movement,\nthe items were dispersed over the slopes. In the upper\n\nparts of the landscape, erosion\nrevealed basalt outcrops and, at\nthe bottom of the valleys levelled\nby fine sediments, it covered the\nolder levels containing Paleolithic\nmaterials. This does not, howev-\ner, refute the existence of areas\ncontaining obvious concentra-\ntions of artefacts separated by\nareas where they do not occur, as\nJoaquim Fontes had already clear-\nly emphasised (Fontes, 1912).\n\nThe most recent summary on\nthe Lisbon Paleolithic Volcanic\nComplex (Cardoso, Zbyszewski\n&amp; Andr\u00e9, 1992) demonstrates\nthe interdependence of the type\nof raw materials used and the\nregional geological sources that\nwere potentially available. Thus,\nin the most westerly zones of\nthis Paleolithic area, close to the\nflint nodules found in the hard\nCretaceous limestone ridges, this\nis the raw material which pre-\ndominates, whereas in the central\nsector, representing the largest\nconcentration of materials, as wit-\nnessed in the Amadora and Ben-\nfica areas, there is a greater use of\nquartzite and quartz, which\nwould have been available locally\nin the remains of the Plio-Qua-\nternary detritic deposits. Finally,\nin the most easterly zone in the\nLoures area, quartz vein pebbles\npredominate, originating in Ter-\ntiary detritic deposits. This shows\nthat, notwithstanding the remark-\nable mobility of these groups and\nthe mere dozens of kilometres\nthat separated the eastern from\nthe western zone, the production\nof artefacts was carried out local-\nly, according to need, and oppor-\ntunistically, making use of rock\nthat was available locally.\n\n2.2. The Tejo valley terraces and the terraces of the left bank\ntributaries\n\n2.2.1. Foz do Enxarrique (Vila Velha de R\u00f3d\u00e3o)\n\nLocated upstream from the previous site and from\nPortas de R\u00f3d\u00e3o and associated with a 5-10 m terrace of\nthe River Tejo periodically affected by river flooding, a\nsingle archaeological level has been identified in an area\nof roughly 150 m2, consisting of fine sediments (Fig. 5)\nwhich, due to the formation of a calcium carbonate pre-\ncipitate, have allowed the presence of faunal remains\n(Raposo et al., 1985). In fact, the association with the\n\n26 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 4.

Zilh\u00e3o (Zilh\u00e3o,\n2001). However the author himself later admit-\nted that although the remains of large animals such\nas elephant and rhinoceros may have corresponded\nto a natural accumulation, to which the remains of\ncarnivores such as the hyena, fox and occasional-\nly bear may be added, the remains of the other\nanimals, particularly deer, which represent almost\n90% of the total, show signs of cutting and burn-\ning (Zilh\u00e3o, 2006). Therefore, even taking these\nreservations into account, this association of\nfauna with lithic remains may still be considered\ngenerally valid as an indication of a human\nencampment in that sector of the river bank,\nwhere it is joined on its right-hand bank by the\nEnxarrique tributary.\n\nThe weighted average of three U/Th datings\non the teeth of horses (2) and aurochs (1) gave a\nresult of 33,600 years BP \u00b1 500 years. The lithic\nassemblage, most of which was chipped on site\nthus establishing the existence of a \u201cwork camp\u201d,\nis dominated by the use of quartzite available local-\nly in large amounts from the gravel levels of the\nterrace.\n\nApproximately 10,000 artefacts were recovered\nwhich unfortunately have still not been studied in\ndetail (Fig. 6). The Levallois technique is frequent-\nly in evidence, either in the form of centripetal\nchipping used to work the cores or in the method\nfor removing a predetermined flake or point, with\nall the stages in the operational chain for prepara-\ntion and flaking present, as well as the correspon-\nding subproducts, most of which must have been\nused without transformation, given the scarcity of\nretouched tools.\n\nDue to the large amount of material it has\nprovided, its stratigraphic features and its absolute\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 27\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 5.

Vilas Ruivas (Vila Velha de R\u00f3d\u00e3o)\n\nTwo thermoluminescence datings gave a weighted\naverage of 54,000 years + 12,000; -11,000 years BP for\nthe surface occupation of the remains of a Quaternary ter-\nrace downstream from Portas de R\u00f3d\u00e3o and 32 m above\nthe level of the Tejo (Raposo, 1995). The main interest of\nthe site lies in the fact that two arched structures have\nbeen preserved, possibly representing the bases for shades\nto protect fire structures suggested by the accumulation of\nthermoclast elements. Four negative structures have also\nbeen identified, which are circular and approximately 20 cm\nin diameter and may be interpreted as post holes (Fig. 7).\nLu\u00eds Raposo (L. Raposo, 1995; GEPP, 1977) has no doubts\nas to the anthropic nature of these structures, not only\nbecause of their configuration but also because they are\nmade from pebbles that had been transported to the area,\ngiven that the underlying geological deposit consists of\nfine sandy silt. The Vilas Ruivas site may therefore be\nassociated with a group which exploited the hunting\nresources of the region adjacent to the great peninsular\nriver, constructing fireplaces \u2013as the aforementioned struc-\ntures may be interpreted\u2013 and using the abundant raw\nmaterial available locally (particularly quartzite pebbles)\nfor processing in the area (as a \u201cworking camp site\u201d). The\nindustry belongs to the Middle Paleolithic and contains\nLevallois discoid cores, together with their associated\n\nsubproducts, in addition to some\nretouched tools, scrapers and\ndenticulates (Fig. 8).\n\nAccording to J. Zilh\u00e3o, fol-\nlowing L. Binford\u2019s ethno-archaeo-\nlogical model, this could be an\nexample of a hunters\u2019 camp and\nhe interprets the two arched struc-\ntures as \u201chunting blinds\u201d, empha-\nsising their similarity to those\nrecorded in the C\u00f4a Gravettian\nsites roughly 150 km to the north\n(Zilh\u00e3o, 1992, 2001).\n\n2.2.3. Vale do Forno (Alpiar\u00e7a)\n\nThe middle levels of the mid-\ndle terrace in Vale do Forno sup-\nplied materials that are characte-\nristic of the Upper Acheulean and\nmay be placed towards the end of\nthis technocomplex, between the\nLate Riss and the Early W\u00fcrm, in\naccordance with radiometric da-\nting obtained from two of the\nlevels, VF 7 and VF 8 (Raposo,\n1995). This therefore defines the\nlower chronological limit of the\n\nMousterian period in Portugal, at least in that region. How-\never, a lack of absolute dates prevents any adequate discus-\nsion of this question in scientific terms.\n\nOne of the sites which has been investigated, Vale do\nForno 8, which belongs to the Upper Acheulean and has\nbeen placed by Lu\u00eds Raposo in the Late Riss, has provid-\ned, in association with typically Acheulean items such as\nsome bifaces and axes, numerous flake artefacts of Middle\nPaleolithic pattern in flint and quartzite including Tayac\npoints, scrapers, denticulates, borers and discoid cores\n(Fig. 9). But their similarities with the sites on the left\nbank of the Tejo estuary located further downstream are\ndenied by L. Raposo. \u201cThis allows the inclusion of these\nassemblages into a wider idea of the Middle Paleolithic,\ndespite the presence of techno-typological characteristics\nvery different from the real Mousterian industries\u201d (Vega\nToscano, Raposo &amp; Santonja, 1999). Nevertheless, the\npresence of some acheulian artefacts is not a decisive argu-\nment against the integration of this industry in the Mous-\nterian complex, having in account the frequence of bifaces\nin the earlier times of the French Mousterian. On the\nother hand, L. Raposo stresses the fact that flaking indus-\ntry predominates, obtained from globulous rather discoid\ncores, corresponding neither to the typical mousterian nor\nto an acheulian technology (L. Raposo, personnal infor-\nmation). In conclusion, when more complete data has\nbeen gathered, the succession of industries discovered in\nsitu in the complex terrace system of the Lower Tejo in\nthe Alpiar\u00e7a region will open up discussion on the transi-\ntion of industries from the Lower to the Middle Paleoli-\nthic, similar to that which has been observed in other\nlarge Peninsular river systems such as the Manzanares an\nTormes valleys.\n\n28 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 7.

Arneiro Corti\u00e7o (Benavente)\n\nIn their study of the Quater-\nnary terraces of the Lower Tejo\nvalley area and the corresponding\nPaleolithic industries, H. Breuil\nand G. Zbyszewski recorded va-\nrious Paleolithic materials asso-\nciated with the terraces of the\nRiver Almansor, a tributary \non the left bank of the Tejo,\nalthough only a small amount\nhad been collected in situ (Breuil\n&amp; Zbyszewski, 1945). Later, the\nsecond of these two authors,\ntogether with O. da Veiga Fer-\nreira, identified other areas in the\nsame region. In four of these\nareas, items were recovered in situ\nfrom the gravel bed deposits of\nthe lower terrace (Q4, between 8\nand 20 m). The materials, made\nexclusively from quartzite pebbles\nand flakes, were classified as da-\nting from between the Upper\nAcheulean and the Mousterian\nperiod (Zbyszewski &amp; Ferreira,\n1967).\n\nLike many others, these occu-\nrrences would not merit any\nspecial attention in a summary\nsuch as this had they not pre-\nceded an important archaeolo-\ngical intervention which made\nthem more significant. In fact,\nas part of the work involved in\nmitigating the environmental\nimpact of the building of the A13\nmotorway, various areas contai-\nning Paleolithic industries dis-\npersed over the surface have been\nidentified, six of which are of\nstratigraphic interest, including\nthe site of the previously un-\nknown Arneiro Corti\u00e7o, which\nmerits excavation work.\n\nThis site is located at an\naltitude of 19 m on the remains\nof a terrace of the left bank of\nthe River Almansor. Surveys have resulted in the recovery\nof 510 artefacts stratigraphic interest (Gaspar &amp; Aldeias,\n2005). It is a characteristic flaking industry of the Middle\nPaleolithic, with the almost exclusive use of quartzite peb-\nbles with a core/flake ratio of 1/5. Expeditive use has been\nmade of the abundant raw materials that are strewn over\nlarge areas of the surface of the several terraces that have\nbeen identified.\n\nThe existence of tools is minimal, denoting a context\nidentical to others from the same period in the Lower\nTejo valley. The average of 61 items per m2 reveals heavy\nchipping activity in the area or nearby, which is another\nidentifying feature of the sites in this region. Unfortu-\nnately, the deposit has not been dated and the chronology\n\nof the site can only be inferred from the geological con-\nditions, which are similar to those at the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o site\ndiscussed later.\n\n2.2.5. The Santo Ant\u00e3o do Tojal terrace (Loures)\n\nMousterian materials have been observed on a 10-15\nterrace in Santo Ant\u00e3o do Tojal, Loures, in the valley of\nthe Tranc\u00e3o River, in cuts exposed by the construction of\nirrigation channels in the 1930s. These are apparently\nassociated with the presence of charcoal and the bones of\nhorses and elephants, slaughtered by the lacustrine area\nwhich existed there at the time (Zbyszewski, 1943, 1977).\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 29\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 8. Industry from Vilas Ruivas. 1 \u2013 endscraper; 2 \u2013 sidescraper; 3-5 \u2013 denticulates; 6-8 \u2013\nLevallois flakes; 9-12 \u2013 cores. 1-9, 11, 12, quartzite; 10, flint (after Raposo, 1995).\n\n\n\nUsing the U/Th datation method, elephant bones\nyielded a result of SMU-305 \u2013 81900 + 4000; -3800 BP\n(Raposo, 1995), which is compatible with the presence of\nthe aforementioned Mousterian items.\n\nThe author developed a model to propose a corres-\nponding model for the occupation and use of the\nresources existing in the region during the Mousterian\nperiod: whilst the banks of the vast alluvial basin of the\nTejo were occupied by open-air residential camps spe-\ncialised in hunting large mammals (horse, elephant), the\ncaves on the top of the limestone hills overlooking \nthe alluvial valleys would have been used less frequently as\nshelters during the course of the hunting. The raw mate-\nrials originated locally: in fact, on the lower terraces there\nwas plenty of quartzite and quartz, whilst in the limestone\nmassifs in which the caves and shelters were set, there were\ngood quality flint nodules. Some of these caves in the\nheart of the limestone area containing flint nodules show\nsigns of low-density occupation. This was the case of the\n\nGruta do Correio-Mor (Loures),\nwhere the stratigraphy identifies\nMousterian activity using flint\nnodules at the base of an essen-\ntially Holocene archaeological se-\nquence (Zbyszewski, 1987), and\nthe Gruta da Ponte da Laje\n(Oeiras), overlooking the stream\nof the same name, where the\ntools have identical characteristics\nand positioning (Cardoso, 1995).\n\n2.2.6. Terraces on the left bank \nof the Tejo estuary\n\nThe Pleistocene sequence of\nterrace systems on the Lower\nTejo is most marked in the\nAlpiar\u00e7a region where they are\nover ten kilometres wide and\nconstitute the largest complex\nof alluvial Pleistocene deposits\nin Portuguese territory. The\nterraces in the region further\ndownstream developing in the\nestuary area are due to oscilla-\ntions in the sea level, although\nthe geochronological framework\nproposed in the 1940s and still\nused today (Zbyszewski, 1946)\nneeds revising in the absence of\nany updating of the entire suc-\ncession observed.\n\nVarious sites of stratigraphic\ninterest are associated with these\ndeposits, indicative of the settling\nof numerous human groups dis-\npersed over the surface of the\nmiddle terrace, roughly 15 m\nabove the level of the stream,\nwhich can be attributed to the\nlast interglacial period in the tra-\nditional chronology (Breuil &amp;\nZbyszewski, 1945).\n\nAlthough flake tools occur in Cascalheira (Alcochete),\n(including points and blades, scrapers, denticulates, sin-\ngle-edged knives and others), it is mainly the discoid cores\npredominate, featuring typical mousterian centripetal fla-\nking (Fig. 10). Numbering more than 500, they represent\nthe largest collection ever found in Portugal (Carreira &amp;\nRaposo, 1994).\n\nThe Alto da Pacheca site, which is closely related to\nCascalheira, is situated in the surrounding area and is\nassociated with the same level of terrace (Cardoso &amp; Mon-\njardino, 1976/1977), where the proliferation of Mouste-\nrian nuclei is also marked. Within the context of the strati-\ngraphic sequence defined in the Alpiar\u00e7a middle terrace,\nthe gravel bed which can be observed in both Cascalheira\nand Alto da Pacheca, crowning a sandy series, may be\nrelated with the beginning of the regressive phase of the\ndeepening of the Tejo river bed, at the beginning of \nthe W\u00fcrmian glaciation, a classification that is compatible\nwith the type of industry found there.\n\n30 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 9.

It is a low ter-\nrace, to use the terminology\napplied by G. Zbyszewski to\nthe Lower Tejo terrace system\n(Zbyszewski, 1946). During the\ncourse of emergency excavation\nwork connected with the buil-\nding of access roads for the\nVasco da Gama bridge, a peb-\nbly level was identified in the\nhighest section of the sequence,\non the uppermost part of which\noccurred abundant of unsmoo-\nthed flake items, indicating that\nthey were penecontemporary\nwith the formation of this deposit\n(Fig. 11).\n\nTwo radiometric dates using\nOSL (Raposo &amp; Cardoso, 1998a)\nwere obtained. A fine clay/silt\nlevel lacking in industry corres-\nponding to the lower part of\nthe sequence and associated\nwith the phase in which the val-\nley was filled in, gave a result of\n74.5 Ka BP (+11,6; -10,4 Ka),\nwhilst a level of eolic sands\nimmediately re-covering the\nupper part of the gravel bed\nwhere the items lay was dated at\n27.2 Ka BP (\u00b1 2,5 Ka), proba-\nbly associated with the climatic\ndeterioration prior to the last pleni-glaciation. However,\nthe stratigraphy indicates that the chronology for the\nmousterian occupation may be close to the more recent\ndate, given aspect the fresh aspect of the surface of the\npieces, indicating that they were rapidly re-covered by the\neolic deposit. In addition, the formation of the gravel bed\ncovering the basal deposit of fluvial-marine sands may be\nassociated with the beginning of a regressive episode,\nwhich parallels the period of climatic deterioration that\nlater led to the deposition of the eolic sands observed at\nthe top of the sequence. If this is the case, the chronolo-\ngy for human occupation would be the same as the one\nidentified for the Gruta da Figueira Brava discussed later,\nof approximately 36 Ka BP, thus making it one of a series of\nsites compatible with a chronology within OIS - 3.\n\nThe conclusions that can be drawn from a technical/\ntypological analysis of the many thousands of items collect-\ned reveal that the area was occupied intensively given the\nabundance and quality of the available raw material, con-\nsisting mainly of quartzite pebbles ranging from the initial\nmass used as nuclei to the typically mousterian discoid\n\ncores. The Levallois technique is in evidence, leading to\nflakes obtained and used immediately or transformed into\nvarious tools, mainly denticulates and notches but also\nsome scrapers and a few borers. The considerable stan-\ndardisation of technical procedures should be emphasised,\nbased on economy of action in relation to the intended\npurpose. This is exemplified in the proliferation of \u201cMous-\nterian disc cores\u201d, an extreme case of simplification of pro-\ncedure in which advantage is taken of the morphology of\nthe natural stone in order to extract the selected flakes\ndirectly from it without the need to shape and prepare\nstriking surfaces (Fig. 12).\n\nIn short, the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o site fully encapsulates the\n\u201cwork camp site\u201d concept of the Anglo-Saxon writers, in\nwhich pre-shaped flake products would have been expor-\nted for use in other areas or on routes used to gather\nresources. In fact the almost exclusive use of quartzite,\nwhich could be found in large quantities in the area, pro-\nduced only 3% of the tools obtained, in contrast with the\nhigh percentage of nuclei, representing 24.3% of the total\nnumber of artefacts.\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 31\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 10.

Other open-air sites in central Portugal\n\n2.3.1. Estrada do Prado (Tomar)\n\nThis is an open-air site located in a middle terrace of\nthe Nab\u00e3o River. The abundant industry seems to have\nbeen developed over successive levels of occupation and\nhas been covered with a fine deposit roughly 2 m deep\n(Mateus, 1984).\n\nOnly a preliminary report has been published of \nthe excavation, in spite of the importance of the site and the\namount and diversity of the flint, quartzite and quartz\nmaterials. The lithic industry, approximately 3,000 arte-\nfacts was found in fine beds formed in a low-energy flu-\nvial environment. The tools show the use of quartzite,\nquartz, shale, arenite and flint, although only the latter is\nused in quantity, representing 20% of the total; it was also\nthe only raw material that could be adequately charac-\nterised. Analysis of the 584 corresponding artefacts\nshowed that the Levallois technique and the disc (cen-\ntripetal) variant was used (27 examples). Some nuclei were\ncompletely used up, which can be attributed to the fact\nthat flint was a scarce raw material in the immediate vici-\nnity of the site. The flakes reveal a high level of facets on\nthe dorsal face, together with a high incidence of trans-\nformation into tools, a fact related to the intensity with\n\nwhich the flint cores were exploited, with a preference for\nlarger sized flakes for processing, totalling 173 items (Fig.\n13) and corresponding to 29.6% of the total flint arte-\nfacts (Chac\u00f3n &amp; Raposo, 2001).\n\n2.3.2. Santa Cita (Tomar)\n\nLike the previous site this is also associated with a\nlow terrace on the right bank of the River Nab\u00e3o, near\nthe mouth of the tributary Bezelga, the sixth and last to\nbe formed (T6b) in a regional sequence. Although there\nis no chronometric information at present for this\ndeposit, or the Mousterian occupation associated with\nit, it is obvious that the last phase in the formation of\nterraces would have occurred during a W\u00fcrmian inter-\nstadial, belonging to OIS 3. Its chronology is set between\n60 and 40 Ka BP, corresponding to a positive warm\noscillation (Lussu et al., 2001).\n\nAfter an initial intervention supervised by Nuno\nBicho, the excavation work, prompted by the building of\nan important road axis, was organised according to va-\nrious objectives including the recovery and preservation of\nthe archaeological structures that had been identified,\nnamely a habitat level.\n\nThe general sequence established during recent archaeo-\nlogical work (Lussu et al., 2001) indicates that two Mous-\nterian levels existed there, the most modern of which (B1),\ninterspersed as a fine deposit, can be identified as the top\nof the Pleistocene terrace, corresponding to the transition\nfrom a level of red clay with signs of pedogenesis to a level\nof yellow silt. However, archaeological materials also exist\non the more recent level B2, allowing in some cases the\nreassembly with materials from level B1. The oldest\narchaeological assemblage is found beneath this fine\ndeposit, lying on top of the conglomerate deposit in the\nterrace (C1), with the industries still in their original\nplace. This paleosurface was preserved by moulding.\n\nThere are therefore two levels on which, at separate\nbut close periods of time, various human activities were\ncarried out. In fact, the existence of reassemblages of\nquartz, quartzite and flint cores in both levels points to\nthis conclusion. No faunal or carbon remains have been\npreserved. Local quartz and quartzite pebbles predominate\nin the terrace conglomerate, whilst flint is much rarer.\n\nThere does not seem to be evidence of any differences\nbetween the materials belonging to the two stratigraphi-\ncally distinct lithic assemblages (B1/B2 and the top of\nC1). The quartzite nuclei were chipped using pre-defined\nreduction techniques in which both the classic Levallois\nand centripetal techniques are present and the flint nuclei,\nas in the previous site, appear heavily exploited.\n\nIn total over 1,400 items were recovered from level\nC1, a larger amount than from B1. In both cases, flakes\npredominate, with evidence of technological differentia-\ntion although no evidence of processing into tools.\n\nA study referring to the initial work undertaken in\nSanta Cita between 1990 and 1997 by a different team\nalso defined two stratigraphically distinct mousterian\noccupations: level \u201cM\u201d, corresponding to level B2 and the\nmore modern level 6 (Bicho, 1997; Bicho &amp; Ferring,\n2001), possibly equivalent to level B1 in the sequence pre-\nviously described. Level C1 was not identified.\n\n32 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 11. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o. Overview of the excavated surface on the top\nof the pebble ground, with some artefacts in situ (photo\nby I. C. F. Fernandes).\n\n\n\nStudies by Nuno Bicho\nreached different conclusions with\nregard to the characteristics of\nthe Mousterian occupations,\nnamely that the older level, con-\ntaining approximately 5,000 arte-\nfacts represents a more intensive\noccupation of the area, associa-\nted with the hypothesis of a\nhabitat structure consisting of 5\npost holes which, according to\nthe author, describe a trapezoi-\ndal circuit. In the upper level,\nconcentrations of small nuclei \nof materials can be observed,\ntotalling no more than 100\nitems. Although neither of the\nMousterian occupations has\nbeen attributed the status of a\ntrue occupation level, the con-\nclusions of the technological\nstudies and studies on the sup-\nply of raw materials were con-\nfirmed in the work cited above.\nIn all the raw materials identi-\nfied \u2014quartz, quartzite and\nflint, in that order\u2014 there is\nevidence of the successive phas-\nes of operative technological\nchains featuring the disc core\ntechnique and, more rarely, the\nLevallois technique (obviously\nused in the more modern level\nand including a Levallois point),\nindicating in situ production. \nAs previously verified, flint was\nthe most heavily worked of all the\nraw materials, especially in\nthe most modern level, certainly\nas a result of its particular suit-\nability for full use of the Leval-\nlois technique, involving raw\nmaterials which came from two\nareas that were over 10 kilome-\ntres apart. Therefore, despite the\nscarcity of the sample available in the upper level, there\nseems to be a quartzite/quartz association in the lower\nlevel which is replaced by a quartzite/flint association in\nthe upper level (Bicho &amp; Ferring, 2001).\n\nScrapers, denticulates and notches were identified\namongst other items (Bicho &amp; Ferring, 2001), thus filling\nin a significant gap in the study produced by Lussu and\nhis collaborators.\n\nThe establishment of the site in a strategic area of\nthe Nab\u00e3o valley plentifully supplied with water and\nraw materials explains the abundance of artefacts asso-\nciated with recurrent occupations of the site during \nthe Mousterian period. It should be stressed that the \ntwo Mousterian occupations later defined are linked\nwith authentic occupation levels, a very rare situation\nin the case of open-air sites. The area may therefore\nhave acted as a logistic camp site, similar to Foz do\nEnxarrique or Vilas Ruivas.\n\n2.3.3. Ribeira da Ponte da Pedra, or Ribeira da Atalaia\n(Vila Nova da Barquinha)\n\nA short distance away from the right-hand slope of\nthe valley of the Atalaia stream, which flows into the River\nTejo, many Paleolithic artefacts have been identified,\nexposed to the surface by present-day erosion that has cut\ndeeply into the succession of the Pleistocene deposits.\nExcavations were carried out on the base of the middle\nterrace (Q3) of the Tejo river system and the upper part\nof the lower terrace (Q4-1 or Q4a).\n\nThe materials collected from the base of Q3 belong\nto the Lower Paleolithic (and are totally devoid of any evi-\ndence of Levallois or disc core centripetal flaking tech-\nnique). Between the upper part of the lower terrace and\nthe base of the middle terrace important levels of ancient\ncolluvium were noted. By 2000 only 134 artefacts had\nbeen excavated from there, including one disc core \n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 33\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 12.

The identifica-\ntion of a paleo-soil containing a\nfire structure led to an extension\nof the area being explored. The\npresence of this structure (and\nprobably of others which have\nnot yet been identified) enough\nto consider this site potentially\nvery interesting. It consists of a\nsub-circular fireplace 0.90 x 1.0\nm, defined along its perimeter\nby local stone elements, with\nsome clear signs of reddening\ncaused by heat. The interior of\nthe structure was filled with an\nash sediment arranged in hori-\nzontal levels beneath the termo-\nclastic gravels.\n\nAlmost all the materials re-\ncovered from this sector of the\nexcavation area were attributed to\nthe Middle Paleolithic. They con-\nsisted of quartzite pebbles, local\nin origin, which provided flakes,\nusually unprocessed, shaped peb-\nbles and nuclei, together with\nbifacial items and evidence of the\nLevallois technique and its disc\ncore variant (Figueiredo et al.,\n2005).\n\n2.3.4. Sites in the area\nsurrounding Rio Maior\n\nGood quality flint in the\nform of nodules found in the neo-\ngenic deposits of Rio Maior basin\nwas used in successive periods,\nfrom the Acheulian to more re-\ncent times. Large amounts of\npinkish-red flint were used in the\nMousterian period to make tools,\nshowing evidence of Levallois\nchipping including some good\nexamples of Levallois and Mous-\nterian cores (Fig. 14), although\nthese were always recovered from\nthe surface, due to the lack of\nexcavation work (Cardoso &amp; Nor-\nton, 1995).\n\n34 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 13.

Coastal sites\n\nRecent surveys along the\ncoast have led to the identifica-\ntion of a small Mousterian occu-\npation on an east Mira beach\nwith evidence of flakes, nuclei\nand flint debitage products de-\nnoting use of the Levallois tech-\nnique (Haws et al., 2006). The\noccupation must have been based\nin the area above the beach, in a\nsandy environment which nowa-\ndays has an altitude of roughly 35\nm. Bearing in mind the regressive\nsea level at the time, its present\nposition has been interpreted as\nthe result of tectonic phenomena\nlocated roughly in the area in\nquestion.\n\nA date for charcoal found \nin a bed of carbonised ashes\nwithin the same geological unit,\nwhose relationship to this site\nhas not, however, been clarified,\nhas given a result of 36 \u00b1 750\nKa BP. This result is similar to\nthat obtained for a deposit also\nsituated on the present coast of\nVale da Janela (Ferrel, Peniche)\nfurther to the south, 38 Ka BP\n+ 1,7; -1,4 Ky, in which a floral\nassociation has been identified,\nevidence of a cool, humid and\nwindy climate. These conditions\nare also present in the Alentejo\ncoast: the S. Torpes palaeonto-\nlogical site, where an palinological\nassociation has been dated from\n39,49 \u00b1 2,34 Ka BP and more\nthan 42,24 Ka BP (Schroeder-\nLanz, 1971). It should be empha-\nsized the presence of Myrica in\nboth associations, a genus with\ntermophile characteristics (Diniz,\n1986, 1993).\n\nThe discovery of this site\nsuggests the existence and even\nfrequency of occupations with\nstratigraphic interest along this\ncoastal strip during the Mous-\nterian. This conclusion results\nthe significant number of fin-\ndings belonging to this period,\nmost of which were recovered\nfrom the surface of the gravel\nbeds of Quaternary beaches\nextending to the south (Breuil &amp; Zbyszewski, 1945).\n\n2.4. Caves of the Estremadura Limestone Massif and\nadjacent area\n\nThe karst caves found in the various Mesozoic lime-\nstone formations in Estremadura are very striking. They\n\nare found rarely in the Algarve crags and in some lime-\nstone outcrops in the interior of the country dating from\nthe Palaeozoic era. However the area extending from the\nArr\u00e1bida to the Sic\u00f3 mountains near Pombal clearly pro-\nvides valuable information on settlements in present-day\nPortuguese territory during the Middle Paleolithic. In\ngeographical order, the following caves are therefore\ndescribed.\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 35\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 14.

Note the large dimensions of the artefacts (after Cardoso &amp; Nor-\nton, 1995).\n\n\n\n2.4.1. Gruta da Buraca Escura (Pombal)\n\nLocated in the heart of the Sic\u00f3 mountains, this cave\nhas supplied items in flint and particularly milky quartz\nfrom the Middle Paleolithic, at its deepest archaeological\nlevels corresponding to Assemblage 3 under the Grave-\nttian occupation (Aubry &amp; Moura, 1994).\n\nThe abundant fauna includes carnivores, raising\ndoubts about the importance attributed to human hun-\nting activity in the aforementioned collection. However,\nthis cannot be the case in terms of the fauna exhumed in\na fire area and its immediate vicinity which, together with\nthe structures identified in Vilas Ruivas, constitutes the\noldest Paleolithic constructive evidence identified in Por-\ntuguese territory. Here splinters from large mammal\nbones have been identified, together with microfauna, a\nphalanx and an astragalus from a mountain goat (Capra\npyrenaica) and an incisor from a young horse (Equus\ncaballus).\n\n2.4.2. Gruta do Caldeir\u00e3o (Tomar)\n\nThis karst cave was excavated under the supervision\nof Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o between 1979 and 1988. Under an Upper\nPaleolithic sequence which confers archaeological impor-\ntance on this cave, a Mousterian sequence has been iden-\ntified, approximately 1 m deep (Levels N to L), from a\nlengthy period of climatic improvement and covered by\nLevel K, which has an average depth of 0.45 m. This level\nis separated from the others by a very marked discontinu-\nity, probably erosive in origin, attributed to the Denekamp\ninterstadial (Zilh\u00e3o, 1997, Fig. 9.3).\n\nThe block of levels N to L contain few artefacts mixed\nwith numerous remains of carnivores, particularly hyena,\nso that its formation essentially correlates with the activi-\nties of these and other carnivores (Davis, 2002). Level K\nalso provided materials that are exclusively Mousterian,\nfeaturing the Levallois technique, although they are not\nnumerous, in association with a plentiful supply of bone\nremains. This also suggests a natural accumulation, per-\nhaps as a result of hyena activity. The direct dating of one\nbone gave a result of 27.6 \u00b1 0.6 Ka C14 BP, correspon-\nding to the date calibrated at ca. 32.4 Ka calBP (Zilh\u00e3o,\n2006). This result, after having been initially accepted by\nthe author, was questioned in his latest work, in which he\nclaims that the date cannot be considered much earlier\nthan ca. 35 Ka calBP, due to extrapolations of a paleocli-\nmatic nature. In other words, the chronology of the most\nmodern Mousterian level in the Gruta do Caldeir\u00e3o is not\nat present established, and it is accepted that the only\nbone dating from this level may have intruded from level\nJb, which dates from the Early Upper Paleolithic, given\nthat the sample recovered from the middle of this level,\nroughly 0.22 m deep, gave a result of 30.8 Ka calBP.\n\nA decline in the use of flint may be observed between\nthe older and more modern Mousterian levels. In Levels\nO-L over 40% of the artefacts are made of flint, in con-\ntrast with the more modern Mousterian occupation (Level\nK), which contains only 13% made of flint. However, the\nscarcity of artefacts in this level means that the signifi-\ncance of these results is limited. No rodents were found\nin Levels L to N and the most positive results for these\nwere found in the most modern level in the Mousterian\nsequence (Level K). Their study (Povoas et al., 1992)\nreveals the existence of very dry open areas (containing\nAllocricetus bursae and a large amount of Microtus arvalis)\ntogether with forest areas (containing Apodemus sylvaticus\nand Eliomys quercinus).\n\n2.4.3. Gruta da Oliveira (Torres Novas)\n\nThe action of water in the River Almonda karst sys-\ntem, which is still being formed, led to the opening up of\na series of cavities at decreasingly and successively more\nrecent altitudes in the rocky massif that forms part of the\n\u201carrife\u201d area of the Aire mountains, overlooking the vast\nplain formed by Tertiary and Quaternary sediments to the\nsouth.\n\nThis cave is still being excavated, under the supervi-\nsion of Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o (Fig. 15), and no definitive results can\nbe presented at the moment. The first published results\nrefer to a deposit initially attributed to an alluvial cone,\nthe \u201cMousterian cone\u201d, found in 1989 and corresponding\nto a secondary sedimentary accumulation within the karst\nsystem above the present entrance to the Almonda cave,\ndue to the collapse of a gallery from a higher level where\nthe Gruta de Oliveira cave is situated. This deposit con-\ntains a large amount of faunal remains and lithic industry\n(around 250 artefacts), mainly made of flint (50%), with\na high incidence of the Levallois technique and many\nretouched tools (scrapers, denticulates). The fauna con-\nsists exclusively of ungulates (there is only one example \nof carnivore amongst the 240 fragments of deer, horse,\nmountain goat, rhinoceros, rabbit and turtle bones)\n\n36 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 15. Gruta da Oliveira. Partial view of the excavated area in\nthe end of 2004 fieldwork (photo supplied by J. Zilh\u00e3o).\n\n\n\nand may therefore be attributed\nto the hunting activities of the\nhuman group established there,\nparticularly as around 20% \nof these remains show signs of\nburning. Two dates have been\nobtained by U/Th from a horse\u2019s\ntooth, giving a weighted average\nresult of 61.5 Ka BP, which is\ncompatible with the typologi-\ncal characteristics of the lithic\nassemblage (Zilh\u00e3o &amp; McKin-\nney, 1995). The deposit there-\nfore corresponds to the oldest\nMousterian occupation of the\ncave, which, in total, is 6 m deep\nand is sealed by a thick level of\nstalagmites.\n\nThe most modern Mouste-\nrian occupation corresponds to\nLevel 8 in the general sequence,\ndated at between 38 and 37 Ka\ncalBP (Zilh\u00e3o, 2006). In con-\ntrast to what was found in the\n\u201cMousterian cone\u201d, the tools,\nwhich show evidence of the Le-\nvallois technique, are mainly\nquartzite, followed by flint, then\nquartz. This trend towards the\nunderepresentation of flint is\neven more accentuated in the\ndeeper levels (Levels 9, 10, 11\nand 12). In Level 9, the radial\nchipping technology is much\nmore evident in comparison with\nLevel 8, featuring in roughly\n54% of the total number of\nitems classified. In both levels it\ncan be seen that the use of raw\nmaterials such as quartzite and\nquartz has not produced items\nof inferior quality obtained by\nmore expeditious technological\nmeans, as is commonly thought\nto be the case in Peninsular\nMousterian contexts (Marks, Mo-\nnigal &amp; Zilh\u00e3o, 2001). In fact, it\nis in the finer-grained pieces of quartzite, rather than in the\nflint, that the application of a refined Levallois technique\ncan be observed (Fig. 16), and this can also be seen indi-\nrectly in the fact that the quartzite flakes are not, on aver-\nage, larger in size than those made of flint. The Oliveira\ncave therefore confirms what is already known from pre-\nvious studies on the Gruta da Figueira Brava and the Gruta\nNova da Columbeira, which have always emphasised the\nimportant presence of quartz and quartzite in Mousterian\nassociations in Portuguese territory.\n\nThe deepest levels reveal an abundance of lithic indus-\ntry, although this has not been properly studied yet, which\nprecedes the date established for Level 9 of 44-43 Ka\ncalBP and probably represents the oldest date of the\n\u201cMousterian cone\u201d. A large quantity of turtle and rabbit\nremains have been recovered from these older levels, which\n\nshow signs of burning, an indication that they had been\ndestined for human consumption (information supplied\npersonally by Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o).\n\nThe sedimentation is continuous until Level 9, then\nbetween this level and Level 8 there is a stalagmite crust\ndeposit, indicating a significant discontinuity in the sedi-\nmentation. This may be linked to climate change since,\nwhilst from Level 10 onwards certain species indicate the\nexistence of open landscapes and a temperate-cold climate\n(mountain goat, horse and rhinoceros), these are absent\nin Level 8, in which deer are the only large ungulates pre-\nsent out of roughly 300 remains that have been identified\n(Brugal, in Zilh\u00e3o, 2001). There is also a low incidence\nof carnivores (fox, leopard and bear) and, in particular, of\na hyena cave. These observations, considered in conjunc-\ntion with the frequent signs of cutting and burning on\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 37\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 16.

In terms of small mammals,\nApodemus sylvaticus and Eliomys quercinus together make\nup approximately 96% of the rodents from this period,\nindicating a Mediterranean climate (Zilh\u00e3o, 2006). More-\nover, it is this environment that explains the existence of\nturtle and rabbit remains, which are particularly abundant\nin the older levels in the sequence. This evidence indi-\ncates the non-selective capture of faunistic resources by\nhumans in the immediate vicinity of the cave.\n\nIn addition, the reduction of the territories in which\nthese resources could be captured during the Mousterian\nperiod is suggested (Zilh\u00e3o, 2001) by a reduction in the\nuse of flint, between the oldest dated occupation, corres-\nponding to the \u201cMousterian cone\u201d, where, out of the 250\nartefacts recovered, around 50% are of flint, 30%\nquartzite and 20% quartz and the more modern Mous-\nterian occupations, represented by Levels 8 to 12. In sup-\nport of this theory, the absence of mountain goat in the\nmore modern deposits should be noted, in contrast with\nits presence in the older levels although its absence may\nin fact correspond to other causes such as a rise in tem-\nperature after an eventual colder period in around 38-37\nKa calBP, as indicated by the exclusive presence of red\ndeer amongst the fauna hunted at that time.\n\nThree human remains recovered from the deeper lev-\nels have been classified as Neanderthal, given that the\nassociated lithic technology is clearly Mousterian.\n\n2.4.4. Gruta da Furninha (Peniche)\n\nThe formation of this cave, which nowadays over-\nlooks the sea, is related to a platform caused by marine\nabrasion of approximately 15 m above sea level. The filling\nin of a vertical aven approximately 10 m high inside the\ncave is therefore more recent than the marine episode\nwhich, using altimetric criteria, correlates with the last in-\nterglacial period (Breuil &amp; Zbyszewski, 1942). Excavations\n\ncarried out in 1879 by J. F.\nNery Delgado (Delgado, 1884)\nwere undertaken in compliance\nwith the best scientific standards\nof the time, and careful records\nwere kept of the stratigraphy\nand positions of all the lithic\nindustries and bones recovered,\nwhich are still preserved today in\nthe Geological Museum in Lis-\nbon. The Pleistocene sequence\nconsisted of a conglomerate at\nthe bottom, containing few fau-\nnal remains, followed by a thick\nsedimentary complex separated\nfrom the former by a stalagmite\ncrust, revealing discontinuity in\nthe sedimentation. This succes-\nsion consisted of seven fossilife-\nrous bone levels, separated by\nabandonment episodes consisting\nof eolic sands.\n\nThe largest lithic and faunis-\ntic assemblage comes from the\nthird and second fossiliferous\n\nlevels. From level 3 an elongated Upper Acheulean biface\nwas recovered, made from unsmoothed flint. The typolo-\ngy of the associated flint items lies mainly within the\nMousterian period, revealing mixtures caused by circula-\ntion currents within the cave. These mixtures were noted\nby Nery Delgado and later assessed by Joaquim Fontes,\nwho carried out a review of the lithic materials and iden-\ntified some Mousterian items (Fontes, 1916: Pl. 1), later\nconfirmed by Breuil and Zbyszewski (1942).\n\nThe existence of Mousterian tools mixed with osteo-\nlogical remains can be explained by the aforementioned\nmixtures, given that the coexistence of humans with large\ncarnivores, essentially represented by the striped hyena\n(Hyaena hyaena prisca) and a small wolf (Canis lupus lunel-\nlensis), is not plausible. Proof of this lies in the fact,\nJoaquim Fontes emphasised that half a Canis lupus radius\ndid not appeared to have been transported to any signifi-\ncant distance and was recovered from the second level\nwhilst the other half was recovered 1.30 m above it from\nanother level. Although it is certain that movement\noccurred, there are no doubts that this Mousterian cave is\ncontemporary with the striped hyena.\n\nA U/Th date suggests the formation of this sequence\nc. 80.88 Ka BP (+42.42; -31.26 Ka). Despite a high level\nof uncertainty, this result is compatible with the older\nchronology of the last interglacial when the cave was\nformed; it is also compatible with the Mousterian indus-\ntry recovered from it.\n\nThe upper part of the accumulation, a level 1.5 m\ndeep of fine micaceous eolic sands correlating with the\nPleniglacial when the shore lay several kilometres away,\nrevealing a vast and windswept sandy coastal plain. The\nsmall amount of industry recovered from the Upper Pale-\nolithic is connected with this final phase in the filling in\nof the aven, and includes two Solutrean laurel leaves and\na single-sided blade, separated by H. Breuil and G.\nZbyszewski in 1942 from the assemblage of a Neolithic\nnecropolis later established inside the cave.\n\n38 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 17. Gruta Nova da Columbeira. Entrance. Photo taken in 1962 during the excavations.\nArchiv of O. da Veiga Ferreira.\n\n\n\n2.4.5. Gruta Nova da\nColumbeira (Bombarral)\n\nExplored in 1962 by O. da\nVeiga Ferreira and G. Zbyszews-\nki, this constitutes one of the\nmost complete and rich Mous-\nterian stratigraphic successions\never identified in Portugal. The\nstratigraphic sequence and the\nassociated artefacts from each of\nthe levels identified are clearly\ndefined (contra Marks, Monigal\n&amp; Zilh\u00e3o, 2001).\n\nThe cave, surrounded by a\nlandscape of Jurassic limestone\n(Fig. 17), is set halfway up the\nleft-hand slope of the Roto val-\nley, which is cut deeply into the\nkarst landscape. It consists of a\nhigh thin gallery, approximately\n20 m long, on average 3 to 4 m\nwide and roughly 10 m high.\nThe stratigraphy observed in\nsuccessive vertical cuts consists\nof a maximum of 10 levels (Fig.\n18) which are almost always separated by a fine stalag-\nmite film, indicating a possible halt in sedimentation and\nin occupation (Zbyszewski, 1963; Ferreira, 1966). The\nlast campaign in 1971, under the direction of J. Roche,\naimed to record a more detailed stratigraphic succession.\nTwo dates were obtained for the levels corresponding to\nthe base of the sequence, with the following results: 26.4\n\u00b1 0.75 Ka C14 BP (Level 7) and 28. 9 \u00b1 0.95 Ka C14\nBP (Level 8). The poor quality of the samples was cited\nby the laboratory (Delibrias et al., 1986). Nevertheless,\nthese two levels, and in particular Level 8, correspond to\nthe most intensive human occupation of the cave, under-\nlined by the presence of a significant accumulation of\ncharcoal and ashes resulting from prolonged burning that\nhad taken place there and whose presence is duly separate\nand uncontaminated from a stratigraphic point of view\n(Ferreira, 1984; Cardoso, Raposo &amp; Ferreira, 2002). There\nappear to be no valid reasons, from an empirical point of\nview, for rejecting the results that were obtained (contra\nZilh\u00e3o, 2006), which, in addition, agree with the corres-\nponding stratigraphy. It is possible that the reserve\nexpressed by the laboratory where the samples were\nprocessed are mainly due to an a posteriori attempt to\nexplain the results obtained which would have appeared\nexcessively recent.\n\nTherefore the results which, after calibration, place\nthe Mousterian occupation of the cave within the period\nbetween 34 and 31 Ka calBP are relevant to the discus-\nsion concerning the last European Neanderthals (Cardoso,\nRaposo &amp; Ferreira, 2002). As J. Zilh\u00e3o points out, the\nfact that these results may fall within the chronology of\nthe Aurignacian and Gravettian periods in the region does\nnot constitute a decisive counter argument, since it is not\npossible to determine a precise chronology for the start of\nthe Upper Paleolithic in the region.\n\nJ. Zilh\u00e3o also observes that if such a modern chrono-\nlogy is accepted for the two levels that have been dated,\n\nthen the deposits which follow them must be even more\nmodern, even from the Solutrean period, which would\ncontradict the Mousterian chronology indicated by their\nrespective industries (Zilh\u00e3o, 2006). In fact, Level 7 cor-\nresponds to the most modern effective human occupation\nof the cave. Level 6 corresponds to the establishment in\nthe cave of a hyena lair indicated by the presence of\nnumerous coprolites, and the amount of artefacts decrea-\nses abruptly \u2013 a situation which can be observed even\nmore clearly in the two more modern levels. Level 8, con-\ntaining 2,433 artefacts, is followed by Level 7 which has\n1,880; Level 6 contains only 677 artefacts 56 and 107\nrespectively in Levels 5 and 4, the most modern in the\nsequence containing lithic industries, indicating the possi-\nbility that it continued to be occupied sporadically over a\nperiod of time that is impossible to determine but cannot\nhave lasted longer than a few centuries.\n\nIn conclusion, Levels 8 and 7 correspond to the \u201cmain\nlevels of human occupation of the cave and the only ones\nin which it is possible to accept the hypothesis of consis-\ntent occupations involving continuous residence\u201d (Car-\ndoso, Raposo &amp; Ferreira, 2002: 50).\n\nThe lithic industries of the Gruta Nova de Colum-\nbeira were attributed to the techo-typological group\nknown as \u201cMousterian with denticulates\u201d, with Levallois\ndebitage and Levallois facies (Fig. 19).\n\nGiven the rarity and the controversy surrounding si-\nmilar occurrences, it is also worth noting the presence of\ncertain bones which had been broken deliberately and\nused as tools, as can be deduced by the marks that remain\non them (Barandiar\u00e1n &amp; Ferreira, 1971; Cardoso, Raposo\n&amp; Ferreira, 2002).\n\nThere is a marked diversity in the use of raw mate-\nrials throughout the entire sequence, revealing a trend\ntowards an increase in the use of flint and a correspon-\nding reduction in the use of quartz and stable levels for\nquartzite. However, this does not mean that this increase\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 39\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 18. Gruta Nova da Columbeira. Longitudinal cross-section. For the stratigraphical descrip-\ntion, see text. Archiv of O. da Veiga Ferreira.\n\n\n\nof flint can be attributed to an extension of the territories\nfrom which resources were gathered. The geology of the\nsurrounding area shows that flint could have been\nobtained in the form of nodules or smoothed pebbles\nfrom the limestone outcrops, including the massif in\nwhich the cave itself is set, whilst quartz and quartzite\nwere plentiful in the lowlands nearby that extended to the\nsea. Moreover, this increasing demand for flint is not\naccompanied by any increase in its use; the rate at which\nit was processed into tools decreased, in contrast to the\nuse made of quartz and particularly quartzite. Thus,\nthe greater demand for flint did not compromise but, in\nfact, stimulated the use made of the other raw materials\n\nand did not correspond to an\nevolutionary pattern that heral-\nded the Upper Paleolithic; \non the contrary, it was obser-\nved in the \u201cMousterianisation\u201d,\nalong the stratigraphic sequen-\nce, of the industries.\n\nEvidently alternating use\nwas made of the cave by humans\nand predators and the levels\nwhich reveal the most inten-\nsive human occupation are\nalso those which contain the\nsmallest amount of carnivore\nremains. In Level 8, which has\na high concentration of carbon\nresulting from prolonged bur-\nning, only one wolf radius was\nrecovered and in Level 7, three\nsets of hyena, in contrast with\nthe abundance of lithic industry\nalready mentioned. Conversely,\nthe levels containing the largest\ncollection of carnivore remains\nin the central part of the fill\ncontained very little lithic indus-\ntry. Lastly, the upper levels, bea-\nring no traces of human pre-\nsence, are characterised by the\npresence of birds, including birds\nof prey and the remains of the\nprey with which they are nor-\nmally associated.\n\nThe composition of the\nlarge mammal fauna (Cardoso,\n1993) suggests temperate cli-\nmatic conditions, with some\ncold and dry spells, favourable\nfor the presence of Capra pyre-\nnaica (mountain goat) which\nwas also well-adapted to the\nsurrounding stony landscape that\nforms part of the Estremadura\nenvironment of low mountain\noutcrops under a strong ocean\nclimatic influence. The existence\nof several rhinoceros (Dicerorhi-\nnus hemitoechus) milk teeth in-\ndicates opportunistic hunting\ninvolving the capture of youn-\nger and weaker animals. How-\n\never, as all the examples of this species are restricted to\nLevel 6 (Cardoso, 1993), which corresponds to the hyena\nlair, these remains may be linked to the activities of this\ncarnivore.\n\nThe most interesting of the faunal elements is the ter-\nrestrial turtle (Testudo hermanni) since this is clearly the\nPortuguese site which contains the largest amount of\nremains of this species (Jim\u00e9nez Fuentes, Cardoso &amp; Cres-\npo, 1998). This species prefers coastal areas at altitudes of\nno more than 500-600 m and a Mediterranean environ-\nment. Nowadays its circum-Mediterranean distribution\nseems to be influenced in particular by a need for sum-\nmer, rather than winter, heat and rain.

As the turtles reproduce\nin summer and incubation lasts\nroughly 2.5 months, between\nJune and August/September they\nneed temperatures that remain\nclose to this optimum. It is\nwithout doubt due to the lack\nof these conditions that the\nspecies became extinct in Por-\ntuguese territory long before the\nend of the last glaciation, as it\nhad been unable to support the\nclimatic deterioration that took\nplace soon after the cave was\noccupied. Of the 349 remains\nidentified, 338 came from Level\n8, which contains the greatest\namount of evidence of human\npresence. There is no doubt that they had been caught by\nhumans and that this had been easy to accomplish, a fact\nthat also lay behind the rapid extinction of the species.\n\nIt is important to emphasise the lack of sea molluscs,\nwhich would have indicated an opportunistic, non-spe-\ncialised use of the resources potentially available in the\nterritory immediately adjacent to the cave; however, the\nimportance of the anthropic deposits suggests a residential\ntype of settlement.\n\nIn conclusion, although the chronometric information\nmerits additional efforts in terms of revision/conformity,\nthe abundance of lithic industry attributed exclusively \nto the Mousterian, the abundance of faunal associations\nthat have been recovered and the relationship that may be\nestablished between the two assemblages throughout the\nstratigraphic sequence, one of the most complete in \nthe Mousterian, and finally, the discovery of a human\ntooth with Neanderthal characteristics on top of Level 9\n(Level 10 is sterile), in contact with Level 7 in a sector\nwhere Level 8 is missing (Ferreira, 1966; Ferembach,\n1964/1965; Antunes et al., 2000), are all factors which\nmake this cave an important site in the Late Iberian\nMousterian period (Raposo &amp; Cardoso, 1998b; Cardoso,\nRaposo &amp; Ferreira, 2002: figs. 15-17).\n\n2.4.6. The Salemas cave and quarry (Loures)\n\nThe former, which was explored in 1961, became\nfamous as a result of the Upper Paleolithic sequence that\nwas identified there. At the base of the fill, an archaeolo-\ngical level from the Middle Paleolithic period was observed,\ncontaining some fairly untypical materials geologically\nassociated with a faunal assemblage also resulting from\nremobilisations within the cave lasting for an undeter-\nmined period of time. A date obtained for a set of these\nremains \u2013thus revealing the average age of the assemblage\nitself\u2013 gave a result of ca. 25 Ka H calBP (Antunes et al.,\n1989), which appears too modern for the industry in\nquestion, even though it is not typical. A deciduous\n\nhuman tooth was also recovered from here and studied\n(Ferembach, 1962) in a recent review, which confirmed\nthat it belonged to a Neanderthal (Antunes, 2000). Near-\nby a stratigraphic succession was observed which had\naccumulated in a deep aven in the Cretaceous limestone\noccurring at the front of a quarry. The base level, con-\ntaining plentiful faunal remains, also revealed an abun-\ndant assemblage of Mousterian materials made from\nblocks of whitish flint available locally that had never been\nstudied in detail. An assemblage of bones of large mam-\nmals was dated at between 27.17 Ka BP (+1.0; -0.9 Ka)\nand 29.82 Ka BP (+1.13; -0.98 Ka) (Antunes et al.,\n1989), corresponding to an average of c. 34.6 Ka calBP\n(Zilh\u00e3o, 2006). Although the faunal assemblage had only\na geological relationship with the Mousterian materials, it\ndoes not appear to be reasonable to doubt the contempo-\nrary nature of both deposits (contra Zilh\u00e3o, 2006) and\nwe believe that this date is valid for the Mousterian occu-\npation of the limestone outcrops in the region.\n\n2.4.7. Gruta da Figueira Brava (Set\u00fabal)\n\nDirectly overlooking the sea and set in a miocenic cal-\ncarenite massif on the south side of the Arr\u00e1bida moun-\ntains to the west of Portinho da Arr\u00e1bida, various excava-\ntion campaigns were carried out in this cave at the end of\nthe 1980s (Antunes, 1990/1991). The entrance to the for-\nmer shelter was gradually filled in by calcium carbonate\nprecipitates (Fig. 20). Only a small part of the interior\nhas been explored but the stratigraphic, faunal and archae-\nological records emphasise the importance of this site. The\nstratigraphic sequence in the area excavated consists of\nmaterials that have been remobilised from other parts \nof the interior of the cave.\n\nThe base of the sequence corresponds to a conglom-\nerate related to the raised, level beach measuring 5-8 m,\nwhich is well preserved in the outer part of the cave, as\nin the whole of the Arr\u00e1bida southern coast (Teixeira &amp;\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 41\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 20. Gruta da Figueira Brava seen from the sea (after Antunes &amp; Cardoso, 2000).\n\n\n\nZbyszewski, 1949) and can be attributed to an interstadial\nform at the beginning of the last glaciation period. How-\never, two recent radiometric dates on shells from the Forte\nda Baralha conglomerate deposit to the west of Sesimbra\nindicate a much more recent chronology of ca. 37 Ka\ncalBP e 38 Ka calBP (Pereira &amp; Angelucci, 2004). As the\noccupation of the shelter had been dated at around 36 Ka\ncalBP \u2013an absolute date for human occupation using\nlimpet shells (Patella sp.) gave statistically identical results\nof 30.05 \u00b1 550 Ka BP e 30.93 \u00b1 0.7 Ka BP (Antunes et\nal., 1989)\u2013 it was concluded that this must have taken\nplace immediately after the formation of the conglome-\nrate deposit. However, the results obtained at Forte de\nBaralha have to be seen as corresponding to the minimum\nage of the corresponding deposits. In fact, the level of the\nsea at the time, would have been approximately 60 m\nlower than its present day level.\n\nThe results presented by these two authors also seem\nincompatible with the actual faunal record identified in\nthe Gruta da Figueira Brava for two reasons. Firstly, it\nwould be impossible, if the sea reached the entrance of\nthe cave, to catch large mammals such as elephant/mam-\nmoth, aurochs, rhinoceros or horses, also incompatible\nwith the mountain land overlooking the submerged area\nof Arr\u00e1bida. These species could only have been caught\non the vast coastal plain if it was exposed and extending\nto the east to the estuary of the River Sado (Antunes &amp;\nCardoso, 2000). Secondly, the aforementioned fossil level\ncontained an abundance of Patella safiana remains, clearly\na southern mollusc abundant nowadays on the Moroccan\nrather than the Portuguese coast (Choffat &amp; Dollfus,\n1904/1905). The presence of this species, and of Pectun-\nculus bimaculatus, a mediterranean species also present,\nindicates warmer waters and is obviously incompatible\nwith the opposite indication supplied by the molluscs at\nthe Figueira Brava cave. Therefore, the dates published in\n2004 for the 5-8 m level at Forte da Baralha are not\nacceptable, particularly since previous attempts made by\nthe same laboratory on identical material from the same\norigin led by a team including the author, proved incon-\nclusive due to lack of collagen.\n\nThe conglomerate level, which mainly consists of\nJurassic limestone pebbles, was identified inside the cave,\nlying directly on the miocenic substrate. This conglome-\nrate is followed by a series of fine carbon beds, resulting\nfrom the lixiviation and transport of the products of com-\nbustion from fireplaces in other areas of the cave, which\ncan also be observed presently in the exterior of the cave.\nThis is followed by a red, fossiliferous level, containing an\nabundant lithic industry resulting from a similar process,\ncrossed by irregular whitish veins of calcium carbonate\n(Level 2). The upper part of this level contains Roman\nand Islamic materials mixed with the remains of domestic\nmammals, shells and birds, and the series is sealed from\nabove by a stalagmite bed which is still forming today.\n\nFrom an archaeological point of view, approximately\nfour thousand artefacts have been studied, or approxi-\nmately two and a half thousand if the splinters from chip-\nping are excluded (Cardoso &amp; Raposo, 1995; Raposo &amp;\nCardoso, 2000a, b). Within this assemblage, the lithic\nindustry appears to be expeditious, with no artefacts dis-\nplaying any notable typological outlines due to the poor\nquality of the raw material, dominated by quartz pebbles\n\nof local origin. Some rare flint items occur, probably ori-\nginating from the S. Lu\u00eds mountains 10 kilometres away.\nChipping from Mousterian centripetal disc cores predo-\nminates; amongst the retouched tools there is a prevalence\nof scrapers, followed by denticulates and notches. Accor-\nding to the traditional typological diagnostic criteria applied\nto Middle Paleolithic assemblages, the Figueira Brava indus-\ntry corresponds to a Typical Mousterian, rich in denticu-\nlates of non-Levallois debitage and facies (Fig. 21).\n\nThe significant invertebrate marine fauna confirms a\nstrong aquatic element in the diet of the Neanderthal po-\npulations based in what was, at the time, a large shelter.\nIn addition to molluscs (indicating waters that were, in\ngeneral, slightly cooler) there was also included crustaceans\nsuch as Maja squinado and Cancer pagurus, whose pincers\nhave been deliberately broken to enable the soft flesh to\nbe extracted (Callapez, 2000).\n\nThe Gruta da Figueira Brava is the most important\nset of paleoclimatic indicators around 36 Ka calBP. All\nthe molluscs belong to species that still exist in the area.\nAmongst them, the great predominance of Patella vulgata,\nwhich is common nowadays on the coast of Galicia and\nthe Asturias and has been replaced on the central and\nsouthern coast of Portugal by P. intermedia, which fea-\ntures rarely in the assemblage, suggests the existence of\ncolder waters than nowadays in the area (Callapez, 2000).\nThe avifauna is also a valuable indicator: in addition to\nvarious extinct species, there are 3 species from a colder\nclimate than nowadays and 2 species from a Mediter-\nranean climate that is incompatible with a cold climate.\nThe majority of the species indicate a temperate climate,\nincluding 3 species that nest nowadays in more northern\nregions, but may be found in this area during the winter\nseason. The conclusion reached by authors is that of a cli-\nmate colder than nowadays but sufficiently warm and\nwith sunny summers, to allow for the existence of\nMediterranean species (Mourer-Chauvir\u00e9 &amp; Antunes,\n2000). The study of insectivores, chiroptera and lago-\nmorphs (Mein &amp; Antunes, 2000) led to conclusions that\nwere compatible with those previously cited: the associa-\ntion of Mediterranean with nordic elements, indicating a\nclimate colder than nowadays and a fairly substantial\namount of forest and rocky terrain. Rodents (Jeannet,\n2000) also suggest a cool temperate climate\n\nThe faunal record therefore indicates that, as the cave\noverlooked the coastal plain at the time, it was here that\nthe majority of the animals were caught, including the\nelephant or even the mammoth (Antunes &amp; Cardoso,\n1991), both by humans and by other predators from the\ncave, such as the leopard, cave lion, hyena, wolf and griz-\nzly bear, alternating with humans in their use of the cave.\nHowever, unlike the Gruta Nova da Columbeira, it was\nnot possible to demonstrate clearly how this human occu-\npation alternated with that of the carnivores, given the\ncharacteristics of the stratigraphic record.\n\nIn the rocky and more mountainous area of the\nArr\u00e1bida range, Capra pyrenaica remains were also recog-\nnised in the faunal assemblage, representing the second\nmost frequent species of large mammal to be identified\n(ca. 22%) after the red deer (Cervus elaphus) (Cardoso,\n1993). This situation indicates the exploitation of various\nbiotopes near the cave, a situation that appears identical to\nthat which has been observed in the other Estremadura\n\n42 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\n\n\ncaves with significant Mouste-\nrian occupations. The human\noccupation is therefore residen-\ntial in type, associated with the\nsystematic and non-specialised\nuse of the various food resources\navailable in the surrounding area,\nfrom the shore to the mountain\narea, including the coastal plain.\nUnderlying this proposition is\nthe abundance of marine species,\nindicating a systematic collec-\ntion from along the rocky or\nsandy shore, both in the inter-\ntidal and infralitoral areas inclu-\nding crustaceans. The area in\nwhich the food resources were\nobtained would not extended\nbeyond the area surrounding \nthe site. The exception is the\nwhitish or sometimes streaked\nflint, which came from the S\u00e3o\nLu\u00eds mountains roughly 10 km\naway in a straight line. However,\nthe scarcity of this raw material\n(161 cores and debitage pro-\nducts out of a total of 3,848\nitems and 21 tools out of a total\nof 358) (Raposo &amp; Cardoso,\n2000) is clear proof of the infre-\nquent use made of this resource,\ndespite its obvious advantages\ngiven the poor quality of the\nlocal rock, and it reinforces \nthe local, though prolonged,\nnature of the human occupation.\n\nAs in the Gruta Nova da\nColumbeira, bones were identi-\nfied that had been deliberately\nbroken and used (Cardoso, 1993:\nfig. 13, n.\u00ba 5; Antunes, 2000).\nThe human presence in this cave\nis also exemplified by a tooth\nwhich clearly has Neanderthal\ncharacteristics (Antunes et al.,\n2000).\n\n2.5. The Hesperian Massif caves\n\n2.5.1. Gruta do Escoural (Montemor-o-Novo)\n\nThis is the southernmost of the caves bearing evidence\nof a Mousterian occupation. It is a karst cave accidentally\ndiscovered in 1963 during quarry blasting and became\nfamous for the parietal paleolithic art identified shortly\nafterwards (Santos, 1964). The existence of quartz mate-\nrials from the Middle Paleolithic, recovered during exca-\nvation work carried out under the supervision of M. Fari-\nnha dos Santos, including nuclei of various types and\nretouched flakes, was observed by the author in the\nNational Archaeology museum in 1989.\n\nThe Mousterian classification for some of these mate-\nrials recovered from a fissure in the exterior of the cave\n\n(Santos, 1985: 140) is due to the work of M. Farinha dos\nSantos, so the presence of a Middle Paleolithic occupa-\ntion was not unknown at the time when the cave was\nre-excavated between 1989 and 1992. Many quartz arte-\nfacts were recovered at this time, near the area already\nnoted by Farinha dos Santos but inside the cave, corres-\nponding to its original entrance area (Silva et al., 1991).\n\nA large amount of hyena remains, in association with\ncoprolites, occurring as a remarkable continuous level inside\nthe cave and related with the aforementioned Middle Paleo-\nlithic occupation, show that human occupation of the cave\nwould have been unfeasible for long periods of time, and\nmost of the remains of ungulantes that have been identi-\nfied must be connected with the activities of these and\nother carnivores such as the leopard (Cardoso, 1993).\n\nA date obtained using U/Th on a deer\u2019s tooth reco-\nvered from a stratigraphic cut made in 1992 into the\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 43\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 21.

The Algarve\n\nAlthough mousterian industries were documented\nsome time ago in Algarve, particularly in the eastern area,\nthrough the pioneering work of G. Zbyszewski and A.\nViana in the 1940s, most of the collected pieces are from\nsurface. Nevertheless, some sites provided some typical\nsamples, with a particular emphasis on centripetal disc\ncores made from quartzite pebbles, a raw material that\nwas plentiful in the Quaternary gravel beds of ancient\nbeaches along the present coastline (Viana &amp; Zbyszewski,\n1949; Raposo, 1997).\n\nRecently a study programme on western part of the\nAlgarve resulted in an preliminary overview of the occu-\npation strategy and of the use of biotic and abiotic\nresources during the Mousterian (Bicho, 2004). Open air\nsites have been found at the edge of temporary lagoons\nsuch as Lagoa Funda 1, 2 and 3 and Lagoa do Bordoal,\nat altitudes of no more than 150 m, together coastal areas\nsuch as the Praia da Gal\u00e9 and others including Vale Boi\n(a rocky shelter roughly 3 km away from the ocean coast)\nand the Ibn Amar cave, now located on the left-hand\nbank of the estuary of the River Arade, facing Portim\u00e3o.\n\nThe fauna has not been preserved in the open-air sites.\nOnly the Ibn Amar cave and Vale Boi provided a econom-\nic indicators of subsistence strategies.\n\nIn the former (Fig. 22) it is important to emphasise the\npresence of fish and mollusc remains, together with medi-\num-sized and small terrestrial mammals which had been\ncaught (deer, ass and rabbit), as evidence non-specialised\n\nhunting and compatible with\nthe wide range of resources availa-\nble, which (as seen in the caves\nin Estremadura) also included\nthe terrestrial turtle (Testudo sp.)\nand fish. The high density of the\noccupation is indicated by the\nfact that only 1 m2 yelded over\n200 artefacts with mousterian\ncharacteristics, together with a\nvariety of raw materials, which\nincluded mainly quartz but also\nflint, quartzite and even lime-\nstone (a discoid core).\n\nVale Boi was another site\nwhich provided faunal remains.\nThe levels below the oldest\nUpper Paleolithic occupation,\nseparated by 0.35 m of sterile\nlayer, supplied untypical arte-\nfacts of quartz, flint and quartzite.\nThese materials were associated\nwith burnt bones, mainly from\nrabbits, and shells. Once again,\nthere was evidence of small-\nscale hunting, as well as a coas-\ntal gathering strategy clearly\n\nlocal in range, the best example of which is Gruta da\nFigueira Brava.\n\nThe use of quartz and quartzite is also evidence of\nlocal supply strategies, with the exception of flint which,\nin some cases, may have come from roughly 30 km away.\nTwo flint quarries have been identified for this period\n(Vale Santo 3 and Curva do Belixe) near the western\nboundary of the region, yielding flint nodules from the\nJurassic limestone, sometimes measuring around 20 cm\nin diameter (Bicho, 2004). Only nuclei were found at\nboth sites, indicating that debitage products, whether\nprocessed or not, would have been exported to other\nareas, probably including the Praia da Gal\u00e9 site approxi-\nmately 30 km away.\n\n3. Ecology, economy, subsistence bases, demographic\npatterns\n\nImportant sites from the Mousterian, including both\nopen-air and cave and rock shelters, have been identified\nand excavated. There were great restrictions on producing\nany suitable characterisation of the former type due to the\neffects of erosion, which has prevented the preservation of\nextensive stratigraphic and faunal elements. It is possible\nthat in most cases site occupation was intensive and\nlengthy, of residential type, given the abundance of the\nremains that are dispersed, in most cases, over wide areas.\nThis is the case with the sites on the outskirts of Lisbon,\nin which flint was used intensively, as well as the Casca-\nlheira and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o sites, amongst others, on the other\nside of the large Tejo estuary, with almost exclusive use of\nraw materials available locally, consisting of quartzite peb-\nbles carried by the Tejo from the Hesperic Massif. Howe-\nver, the shortage of information, due to the lack of exten-\nsive excavation works, does not allow the full understanding\n\n44 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\nFIG. 22. View from Gruta de Ibn Amar, showing the spring system in low tide within the Arade\nRiver estuary (photo supplied by N. Bicho).\n\n\n\nof the organisation of the inhabited areas, their limits and\nthe possible existence of intra-site areas devoted to specific\nactivities.\n\nTaking into account the published data, the two open-\nair sites located in the Upper Portuguese Tejo area (in the\nVila Velha de R\u00f3d\u00e3o region) apparently have distinctive\ncharacteristics. Both the Foz de Enxarrique and Vilas\nRuivas sites appear to correspond mainly to a logistic\ncamp sites, particularly the latter, not only because of the\nsmaller amount of catalogued evidence but also due to\nthe prevailing hunting activities. This can be seen, on the\none hand, in the very large percentage of deer bones\nshowing signs of cutting and breaking at Foz do Enxar-\nrique, located on a small platform where the Tejo is joined\nby the Enxarrique stream, a favourable location for a tem-\nporary specialised site periodically flooded. It can also be\nseen in the structures that may be classified as fireplaces\n(Raposo, 1995) or hunting blinds (using the terminology\nof L. Binford) according to Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o (Zilh\u00e3o, 2001) in\nVilas Ruivas, together with the small concentration of\nmaterials observed there.\n\nThe importance of the stratigraphic sequences of some\nof the caves, such as the Gruta da Oliveira and the Gruta\nNova da Columbeira indicate residential types of sites,\nwith prolonged and recurrent characteristics. The Gruta\nda Figueira Brava also appears to indicate this type of\noccupation, although clearly it is not possible in any \nof these cases to determine the duration of human presence\nnor, in most cases, any possible seasonal occupation. How-\never, whilst certain sites indicate short-term occupation\ndue to the scarcity of the artefacts found and the poor\nstratigraphic record \u2013as in the case of Lapa dos Furos,\nwhere only seven artefacts were identified, corresponding\nto a date of 40 Ka calBP as a terminus post quem for the\nMousterian occupation (Zilh\u00e3o, 2006)\u2013 the Gruta da\nFigueira Brava was certainly occupied in spring and sum-\nmer, given the abundance of young rabbits that had clear-\nly been caught by humans (Mein &amp; Antunes, 2000). It is\nclear that their occupation of the cave alternated with that\nof carnivores, as observed in other caves dating from the\nsame period (Gruta do Caldeir\u00e3o, Gruta do Escoural,\nGruta Nova da Columbeira).\n\nThe area in which resources were gathered \u2013including\nraw material for manufacturing artefacts\u2013 was always\nrestricted to the area surrounding each site and was char-\nacterised by a non-specialised economy of hunting-gathe-\nring. Medium-sized mammals clearly predominated, such\nas red deer and horse, common at the time in their respec-\ntive biotopes and indicative of open land, or correspon-\nding more to forest areas. The scarcity of certain species\nsuch as auroch is mainly due to the difficulty involved in\ncapturing them.\n\nSix deciduous rhinoceros teeth (D. hemitoechus) were\nrecovered from Level 6 of the Gruta Nova da Columbeira;\nhowever, as the human presence is slight in this level, the\npresence of this species may be attributed to the activities of\nlarge predators and the same may be true of a fragment\nof jawbone containing two molars worn to the roots at\nGruta da Figueira Brava, corresponding to an old indivi-\ndual. This was also the pattern witnessed in Lorga de\nDine, where there is no evidence of any compatible\nhuman occupation (Cardoso, 1993).\n\nNevertheless, the hunting of large mammals is clearly\ndocumented by the aurochs (and eventually by the elephant\n\nand the mammoth); some deliberately broken auroch\nbones had been transformed into various tools.\n\nThe hunting of medium-sized prey is documented\nboth in Gruta Nova da Columbeira and Gruta da Figueira\nBrava. The majority of the remains consisted of deer\n(almost 60% in the former and 34% in the latter) whilst\nother species such as horse and mountain goat were also\npresent but in differing amounts due to the nature of their\nrespective biotopes (the contribution made by carnivores\ncannot be quantified, but would have been much lower,\nbearing in mind the number of remains preserved, parti-\ncularly in Levels 8 and 9 of the Gruta Nova da Colum-\nbeira, as previously emphasised).\n\nThe exclusive presence of red deer amongst the fauna\nhunted at Gruta da Oliveira in the most modern Mous-\nterian levels dated at 38-37 Ka calBP indicates a more\ntemperate climate, perhaps warmer than the one corres-\nponding to the presence of this species in the two pre-\nvious caves (36 Ka calBP for Gruta da Figueira Brava and\n34-31 Ka calBP for Gruta Nova da Columbeira, if these\nresults are to be accepted, given the reasons previously\nexplained), both of which indicate a temperate but cooler\nclimate than nowadays, due to the presence of the moun-\ntain goat. Thus a climatic cooling would have begun ca. 36\nKa calBP, leading gradually to the full pleniglacial, a con-\nclusion that has been presented previously on the basis of\nthe study of large Pleistocene mammals (Cardoso, 1993).\n\nThe frequent presence of the terrestrial turtle, which\nis largest in terms of amount in Level 8 of Gruta Nova\nda Columbeira indicates a higher anthropic incidence.\nThe same conclusion may be extended to the remains of\nthis species originating in the deeper levels of the Gruta\nda Oliveira, which are carbonised, like the rabbit remains\nassociated with them. In fact, both species are plentiful in\nmost of the caves showing human mousterian occupation\n\u2013and also marked in the Gruta de Ibn Amar (Bicho,\n2004)\u2013 although they differ in quantity, indicating a prac-\ntice of the hunting of small animals, which seems to have\nbeen common throughout the Late Mousterian period.\n\nIn addition, the importance of gathering molluscs\nfrom the shore should also be stressed in the areas nearest\nto the coast, such as Gruta da Figueira Brava and Gruta\nde Ibn Amar, where fishing has also been recorded. In the\nformer, the marine prey also extended to crustaceans\n(Maja squinado, Cancer pagurus), whose pincers were\nfound deliberately broken (Callapez, 2000), and marine\nmammals such as the common dolphin (Delphinus del-\nphis) and the ringed seal (Pusa hispida), both represented\nby one individual (Antunes, 2000). These may correspond\nto the secondary exploitation of animals washed up on\nthe shore (or captured on it, in the case of the seal), \nwith the the latter species indicating a colder climate than\nnowadays. This is a clear indication of the importance\nof the marine resources gathered and consumed in the\ncave, at present a unique evidence in Portuguese territo-\nry in terms of the variety and abundance of the remains\npreserved.\n\nIt can therefore be concluded that the claim made by\nNuno Bicho (Bicho, 2004) cannot be confirmed, accor-\nding to whom the pattern for settlements in the Algarve\nduring the Mousterian period would have been very dif-\nferent to that of Estremadura, on the basis of the pre-\nsence of small prey (turtle and rabbit), in association with\n\nJo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 45\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\n\n\naquatic fauna. This association can also be seen in\nEstremadura where the aquatic contribution could even\nbe more significative.\n\nThe fact that this practise has not been recorded in\nthe Gruta Nova da Columbeira, located approximately 10\nkm away from the present coastline indicates that the co-\nrresponding territories were, in fact, restricted in size.\n\nThese territories may also have varied in size over\ntime. Taking as comparison the percentage of flint items\n\u2013a rock whose specific features were preferred in general\nto others\u2013 found in the two most complete stratigraphic\nsequences studied, it can be seen that the use of flint\ndeclined in the Gruta da Oliveira between the earliest and\nmost modern Mousterian occupations. It may therefore\nbe concluded that the respective territories for gathering\nresources may have been reduced in size (Zilh\u00e3o, 2001:\nfig. 2). However, a closer observation shows only a\ndecline in the presence of flint from the \u201cMousterian\ncone\u201d and the assemblage from Levels 8 to 12. As N.\nBicho points out (Bicho, 2004), the trend is positive,\nshowing a consistent increase in time between Level 11\nand Level 8.\n\nThe dubious legitimacy of an indicator of this kind\nshould also be noted: in Gruta Nova da Columbeira there\nwas also an increase in the use of flint but this was not\nrelated to any true need for supplies of this superior quality\nraw material, since there was no increase in the number\nof tools manufactured from it, unlike the numbers for\nthose made from quartz or quartzite (Cardoso, Raposo &amp;\nFerreira, 2002: fig. 18).\n\nThe scarcity of flint artefacts in the assemblage from\nGruta da Figueira Brava \u2013only 161 nuclei and products\nfrom debitage out of 3,848, or 21 tools out of a total of\n358 (Raposo &amp; Cardoso, 2000)\u2013 has led J. Zilh\u00e3o (Zi-\nlh\u00e3o, 2006) to contemplate a restricted territory in which\nresources were gathered. However, the low visibility of this\nresource should also be emphasised, since it occurs in fine\nbeds interstratified in the limestone that have only recently\nbeen exposed with the opening up of extensive quarrying\nareas, meaning that its scarcity cannot be used as an argu-\nment to support this conclusion.\n\nWhatever the case may be, other variables should also\nbe taken into consideration, such as exchanges amongst\ngroups and cultural aspects that may have led to a prefe-\nrence for a particular type of rock, obviously without\nexcluding the mobility factor itself and, together with this,\nthe size of the corresponding territories. These factors,\npossibly interacting with each other may, as a whole,\nexplain the almost exclusive use of quartz during the\nMousterian period, replaced by flint in the Upper Paleo-\nlithic occupations in the Gruta do Escoural (Otte, in\nZilh\u00e3o, 2001).\n\nGiven the current state of knowledge, the general con-\nclusion that may be advanced is that during the Mouste-\nrian period the territories must have, in fact, been rela-\ntively restricted.\n\nIn the Algarve, the sites discovered so far are located\nno more than 10 km away from the present coastline\n(Bicho, 2004), meaning that most of the inland Algarve\narea would have been covered at the time by dense maquis\nand forests, making travelling and hunting in that area\ndifficult. The exceptions would have been the water cour-\nses which, as in the case of Estremadura, would have been\n\na good means of penetrating and travelling into the area,\nfavouring hunting and, therefore, open-air establishments\nof groups of people, a situation that is particularly well-\nevidenced by finds recovered in the Tejo valley and its\ntributaries or sub-tributaries, such as the River Nab\u00e3o in\nthe Tomar area or the River Almansor in the Benavente-\nSanto Estev\u00e3o area.\n\nAfter a warm period, corresponding to the formation\nof the deposits of Furninha cave, ca. 80 Ka calBP, with\nthe stripped hyena, the is no relevant paleoclimatic infor-\nmation until ca. 45 Ka calBP. The Estremadura coast\nwould have been at that time mainly covered by pine and\nEricaceae, followed by Quercus, Corylus, Myrtus, Ilex and\nMyrica, indicating an open, windy landscape and a tem-\nperate-cool humid climate (Diniz, 1993). The same con-\nclusion is valid to the Alentejo coast (Diniz, 1986;\nSchroeder-Lanz, 1971). However, it should be emphazise\nthe presence in both sites of Myrica, a genus with ther-\nmophilic characteristics.\n\nAfter this cool period, also suggested by the mountain\ngoat in the lower levels of Gruta da Oliveira, older than\n43 Ka calBP, the climate would generally have been\nMediterranean ca. 39/40 calBP up to 38-37 Ka calBP as\nshown by the presence of rodents of mediterranean char-\nacteristics in Level 8 of Gruta da Oliveira (38-37 Ka\ncalBP) and of Cepaea nemoralis, a land snail, recovered in\nlarge amounts from the Lapa dos Furos (Tomar), dated\naround 40 Ka calBP (Callapez, 1999). Meanwhile, as\nexpected, the mountain goat disappeared from Gruta da\nOliveira.\n\nThese conditions were slightly modified up to 34-31\nKa calBP, coinciding with the end of the Mousterian, con-\nsidering the dates from Gruta Nova da Columbeira. In\nfact, although the presence of the turtle in most of the\nimportant caves that have been studied (Gruta Nova da\nColumbeira, Gruta da Oliveira, Gruta de Ibn Amar and\nGruta da Figueira Brava) is an indicator of a warm tem-\nperate climate, the mountain goat reappearing afterwards\n(Gruta da Figueira Brava, Gruta Nova da Columbeira)\ncorresponds to a cooler climate. The microfauna in Level\nK of the Gruta do Caldeir\u00e3o (P\u00f3voas et al., 1993), with\nAllocricetus bursae, discovered in Portugal for the first time,\ndemonstrates the extension of eurasiatic steppes in the\nIberian peninsula ca. 35 Ka calBP. In conclusion, we can\nadmit that until 36 Ka calBP there was a progressive cli-\nmatic cooling that became more severe during the estab-\nlishment of the first industries of the Upper Paleolithic c.\n34 Ka calBP.\n\nThe fact that the first biologically modern human\npopulations did not occupy the centre, south and west of\nthe Iberian Peninsula until around 34 Ka calBP must\nhave been due to the combined effects of two factors: the\npossible difficulty of adapting to the respective natural\nenvironments and, above all, the fact that these environ-\nments were occupied by populations that were biologi-\ncally progressive (not in the sense that they were approa-\nching the status of sapiens sapiens, but in the strictly\nbiological sense and within a Neanderthal frame of refe-\nrence), although possibly technologically and culturally\nless developed. In this context, it would be expected that\nthe size of the respective territories would have played a\ndecisive role: the smaller and geographically more accessi-\nble territories would have generated all the phenomena of\n\n46 Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal\n\n\u00a9 Universidad de Salamanca Zephyrus, 59, 2006, 21-50\n\n\n\nacculturation and/or a rapid decrease in population and\nthe extinction of the less well-equipped population. The\nless geographically accessible territories would have led \nto the preservation of cultural traits and a longer survival of\nthe older populations who could make use of sufficiently\nlarge areas for reproduction. This would have been the\ncase in the east (Greece and Italy) and the west (Portugal\nand Mediterranean Spain) respectively. Their faunal asso-\nciations, especially in the Iberian case, which document\nthe survival of ancient mega-fauna remains until very\nrecent times (note, for example, the occurrence of Palaeo-\nloxodon antiquus close to 33,6 Ka calBP at the Foz do\nEnxarrique site, afterwards replaced by a common fauna,\nof a modern type), are proof of these particularities, with\nthe Neanderthal population constituting only one ele-\nment in the broader geographical and natural frame-\nwork. Moreover, the role played by the present-day Por-\ntuguese territory as an area of refuge originates in much\nearlier times: in this context it is important to remem-\nber the presence of large numbers of Hyaena hyaena\nprisca (the antecedent of the present-day African striped\nhyena), as well as the ancient subspecies of small wolf\n(Canis lupus lunellensis) in the Furninha cave (Peniche)\nat the start of the last Ice Age (around 80 Ka BP), whilst\nin the area of Europe beyond the Pyrenees records only\nexist up to the Mindel-Riss interglacial period, as they\nwere unable to survive the rigours of the Rissian cold\nthat began around 250 Ka BP.\n\nThe past decade and beginning of this one con-\ntributed with theoretical models to explain the late sur-\nvival of the last Neanderthals in the south and southwest\nof the Peninsula. This situation may at least be partly\nexplained by ecological reasons and the behavioural pre-\nferences of the two human groups, which has been called\nthe \u201cEbro frontier\u201d, an imaginary geographical line that\nwould act as a stable barrier between the region to the\nnorth and the rest of the Peninsular territory inhabited\nby the last Iberian Neanderthals (Zilh\u00e3o &amp; Trinkaus,\n2002: 567).\n\nHowever, this demographic model based on a lasting\nand stable separation between two populations has also\nbeen questioned recently (J\u00f6ris, \u00c1lvarez Fern\u00e1ndez &amp;\nWeninger, 2003). The authors verify that (1) there is a\nclear discrepancy between the radiocarbon dates obtained\nfor bones and charcoal, with the latter being several thou-\nsands of years more modern; 2) as a consequence, they\nconclude that there is no proof of the duration of Middle\nPaleolithic industries in the southwest of the Iberian\nPeninsula during the oldest phases of the Aurignacian, a\nconclusion which contradicts the \u201cEbro frontier\u201d model\nwhich, as previously stated, distinguished between the\nLate Mousterian industries of the southwest and those of\nthe Early Aurignacian in the north east; 3) in fact, the\navailable dates imply a model of population dynamics\nwhich shrank during the most intensely arid and cold\nphases and expanded during the warmer interstadial pha-\nses, giving rise to the idea of regional development during\nthe Aurignacian in south-east Europe based on Late\nMousterian industries produced by Neanderthals. These\ntransitional industries are, however, completely absent\nfrom Portuguese territory, in which the Aurignacian is at\npresent known only in its developed state and whose\nabsolute chronology is still very imprecise. In common with\n\nthe previous model, the geographical interpenetration\nof the territories occupied by the two human groups\ndepended on climatic causes.\n\nThis new vision of the transition from the Middle/\nUpper Paleolithic in the Iberian Peninsula, has already\nbeen the object of an initial and full discussion (Zilh\u00e3o,\n2006).\n\nOther contributions will certainly be added in the\nnear future, as a result of the research that this subject has\nstimulated in recent years and on the basis of new infor-\nmation obtained from excavations currently taking place,\nnew results will be produced so that the present limita-\ntions referred in this summary will be overcome.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am deeply greatful to Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o, Nuno Bicho and\nLu\u00eds Raposo who provided photos and informations.

With this work already in press, there\nwas an oral communication addressing two new Middle\nPalaeolithic sites having stratigraphic interest on the left\nbank of the middle Tagus river valley, azinhal and Pego\ndo Tejo II (Nisa county), almost in front of Vilas Ruivas\nsite. The first site had an association of micoquian\nbifaces with denticulates and was dated by OSL from 61\n+/-7 Ka. The second site presented an association of\nmousterian cores with denticulates, and was dated from\n135 +/-21 Ka, also by OSL. We thank the author, Nel-\nson Almeida, the possibility to refer these results before\ntheir publication.\n\nBibliography\n\nANTUNES, M. T.
