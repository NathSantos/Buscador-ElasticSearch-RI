The \npresent work investigates the distribution, the factors controlling concentrations, and toxicity risks of \nthe metals Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al and Fe, in surface sediments of the four rivers. Toxicity \nwas evaluated using the Consensus-based Sediment Quality Guidelines for freshwater ecosystems. \nSpearman correlation analysis did not indicate any association of the metals with organic matter, \nhowever strong, moderate and weak correlations with aluminium, iron, and manganese, respectively, \nsuggested that clay minerals were the main carrier of metals to sediments. Concentrations of \nmetals in all samples were below the TEC (threshold effect concentration), indicating that for these \ntrace metals adverse effects on aquatic biota should rarely occur. A geochemical baseline for the \nregion was defined using lithium as reference element. Metal enrichments due to anthropogenic \ninfluence were only observed at three sites. At other sites, enrichment factors were indicative of \na large predominance of naturally occurring metals in the sediments.\n\nKeywords: sediments, trace metals, geochemical baselines, Poxim River\n\nIntroduction\n\nAquatic sediments accumulate metals derived from both \nnatural processes as well as anthropogenic activities, and \nplay a fundamental role in redistribution of these elements \nto water and aquatic biota. The ability to accumulate and \nredistribute chemical species makes sediments extremely \ninteresting for the purposes of environmental investigation, \n\nsince they can provide a semi-permanent record of levels of \ncontamination.1-3 In order to determine the contamination \ndegree of a sediment, it is first necessary to calculate the \nnatural component of the total metal concentration, which \nrequires determination of the background concentration and \nits natural variation. Various normalization procedures have \nbeen employed to take account of natural variability, and \ndetect and quantify anthropogenic enrichment.4-7\n\nGeochemical normalization consists of establishing \nmathematical correlations between metal concentrations \n\n\n\nGarcia et al. 1335Vol. 20, No. 7, 2009\n\nand the concentration of a reference element, such as \naluminium, iron or lithium. The reference element must \nbe of lithogenic origin, be structurally linked to at least \none of the main carriers of metals to the sediment, and \nits concentration must not be significantly influenced \nby anthropogenic inputs.3,8 Aluminium has been most \nfrequently used for normalization, since it is the main \ncomponent of fine-grained aluminosilicates. However, \nin the case of sediments composed mainly of immature, \nphysically abraded material, such as feldspars, aluminium \nhas not shown good correlations with metals, since in \nsuch sediments it is present in similar proportions in both \nfine and coarse fractions. Here, lithium has been found \nto be a better normalizer, since it is associated with the \nsame mineralogical components as the trace metals.3,9-10\n\nFor uncontaminated sediment samples, correlation plots \nbetween the metals and the reference element are used \nto generate regression lines representative of the regional \ngeochemical baseline.\n\nThe total sediment concentration of a metal does not \nprovide information concerning its mobility, availability \nor toxicity. Toxicity is dependent on the amount of metal \navailable for bioaccumulation (accumulation by biological \norganisms), and it depends on those sediment properties \nthat affect its bioavailability. Hence, it is possible for \nsediment to be metal-contaminated (to have a metal \ncontent higher than the natural background), but not \nmanifest any toxic effects, depending on the geochemical \nprocesses that control the availability of the metal in the \nsediment.11-15\n\nVarious sediment quality guidelines (SQG) have been \ndeveloped by North American agencies, for fresh water \nand marine ecosystems. These are used as informal tools, \nto evaluate the extent to which chemical species associated \nwith sediments can induce adverse effects in aquatic biota.16-18\n\nSelection of the most appropriate SQG to use in a given \napplication is not always straightforward, mainly due to \nthe existence of limited recommendations for the use of the \nvarious guidelines, and the fact that some show differences \nof up to several orders of magnitude in numerical values \nfor the same substance. The consensus-based sediment \nquality guidelines for fresh waters were developed in an \nattempt to resolve such difficulties. These were derived for \n28 chemicals (metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, \npolychlorinated biphenyls and pesticides),19 from previously \npublished SQGs,20-24 and for each contaminant provide two \nconcentrations associated with adverse effects in aquatic \norganisms. The threshold effect concentration (TEC) is \nthat below which no adverse effects should occur, and the \nprobable effect concentration (PEC) is that above which \nadverse effects may occur frequently. \n\nThis work is the first study of trace metal geochemistry \nin surface sediments of the Poxim River hydrographic \nsub-basin in Sergipe State, Brazil Northeast. Sediment \nsamples were analyzed in order to define a regional \ngeochemical baseline, to identify any impacted areas, and \nto evaluate possible toxicity based on consensus-based \nSQG reference data. Potential factors controlling the \ndistribution and mobility of metals in the sediments were \nalso investigated.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy area\n\nThe Poxim River hydrographic sub-basin drains an \narea of around 380 km2 and is located in the East of \nSergipe State between latitudes 10\u00b055\u2019S and 10\u00b045\u2019S, and \nlongitudes 37\u00b005\u2019W and 37\u00b022\u2019W. The region includes \nparts of the municipalities of Aracaju, Areia Branca, \nLaranjeiras, Itaporanga d\u2019Ajuda, Nossa Senhora do Socorro \nand S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, with a total population of 721,726 \ninhabitants.25,26 The River Poxim sub-basin principally \ncomprises the Rivers Poxim-A\u00e7u, Poxim-Mirim, Poxim and \nPitanga, along a west-east axis, and is currently responsible \nfor around 30% of the water supply to the City of Aracaju, \nthe State capital.\n\nThe Poxim River comprises the watercourse formed \nby the confluence of the Poxim-A\u00e7u and Poxim-Mirim \nRivers, and near its source is joined by another affluent, \nthe Pitanga River. In its final stretches it passes through \nurban areas of the municipalities of S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, \nNossa Senhora do Socorro and Aracaju, where it \nreceives in natura effluents from domestic and industrial \nsources.27\n\nSample collection\n\nForty-five surface sediment samples were collected \nat fifteen sites in the Poxim River sub-basin (Figure 1), \nduring February 2006, using a core sampler with a cellulose \nacetate-butyrate tube. Portions of 5 cm were removed from \nthe top of each core, using non-metallic utensils to avoid \ncontamination, placed into sealed plastic flasks, and stored \nover ice during transport to the laboratory. In the laboratory, \nthe fine fraction (&lt;63 \u00b5m) percentage was determined by \nliquid sieving of the sample, drying at 100 oC to constant \nmass, and weighing.\n\nThe fine fraction used for metal determination was \nobtained by first drying the samples in a forced-air \ncirculation oven at 50 oC for 72 h (to a constant mass), and \nthen sieving to separate the &lt;63 \u00b5m fraction.\n\n\n\nRegional Geochemical Baselines and Controlling Factors for Trace Metals in Sediments J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1336\n\nChemical analysis\n\nFor determination of total metal concentrations, samples \n(ca. 0.5 g) were treated in closed Teflon vessels, using 2 mL \nof HNO\n\n3\n, 1 mL of HCl and 4 mL of HF, (all concentrated) \n\nand heating at 140 oC for 2 h. After cooling, the vessels \nwere opened and maintained at 210 oC until complete \ndryness was achieved. The residue was dissolved in 10 mL\nof 0.5 mol L-1 HCl, and the volume made up to 50 mL. \nThe solutions were stored in polyethylene flasks for later \ndetermination of metals using flame or graphite furnace \natomic absorption spectrometry.\n\nReagent blanks were prepared in the same way as \nsamples, and three certified sediment standards (LKSD-1 \nCCNRP/Canada lake sediment, NCS DC 75304/China river \nsediment, and NCS DC 78301/China marine sediment) \nwere analyzed for quality control purposes. Results showed \nno significant contamination in blanks and trace metal \nrecoveries from the reference materials were within the \nrange 92-106%.\n\nPartial metal concentrations were determined using US \nEPA Method 200.8. Samples (ca. 1 g) were treated in closed \nTeflon vessels using 4 mL of 1:1 HNO\n\n3\n solution and 10 mL \n\nof 1:5 HCl solution. The mixture was held at 95 oC for \n30 min. Following extraction, samples were filtered using \nquantitative filter paper, transferred to a 50 mL volumetric \nflask, and made up to final volume using ultra-pure water. \nSolutions were stored in polyethylene flasks for later \ndetermination of metals using flame or graphite furnace \natomic absorption spectrometry. Three blank solutions \nwere prepared in the same way as samples, and analytical \nquality control was achieved by analysis of the certified \nlake sediment standard (LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada), which \nis also certified for partial extraction. Results showed a trace \nmetal recovery in the range 97-103%. Metal concentrations \nwere determined using three replicates. \n\nTotal carbon contents of the samples were measured \nusing an elemental analyzer (NCHS-O, Flash ES 1112), at \na combustion temperature of 900 oC. Organic carbon (C\n\norg\n)\n\nwas calculated as the difference between carbon contents \nmeasured before and after sample calcinations at 550 oC for \n1 h. The certified lake sediment standard (LKSD-1 CCNRP/\nCanada) was used for quality control, with three replicates \nshowing a mean recovery of 96.3 \u00b1 4.2%.\n\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) and correlation \ncoefficient calculations were undertaken using Statistica \nfor Windows (v. 6.0).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nSediment characteristics and relationships with trace \nmetals\n\nSediment metal concentrations, organic carbon \ncontents, and fine fraction (&lt;63 \u00b5m) percentages are given \nin Table 1. All samples showed low fine fraction contents, \nwith a range of 4.7-19.6% and mean of 11.0 \u00b1 4.1%.\n\nNatural sediment trace element concentrations are \nstrongly influenced by the nature of the inorganic material \nresulting from physical and chemical weathering. This \nmaterial is mainly formed from a limited number of silicate \nminerals, such as quartz, feldspar, mica and clay minerals, \nwith a smaller contribution from metal oxides and sulfides. \nClays comprise the finest fractions, and tend to absorb more \nmetals, which is why analysis of the fine fraction has been \nused as a means to correct for natural variability of metal \nconcentrations.28,29\n\nFine fraction organic carbon contents varied between \n1.0% and 5.7%, with a mean of 3.0%. The highest value \nwas obtained for site 6, at the confluence of the Poxim-A\u00e7u \nand Poxim-Mirim Rivers.\n\nCorrelation analysis was used to identify potential \nfactors controlling the distribution and mobility of metals in \nthe sediments. The Spearman correlation matrix obtained is \nprovided in Table 2. The trace metals showed no correlation \nwith C\n\norg\n, indicative of no, or at best weak, association \n\nbetween these elements and organic matter in the sediments. \nThis is in agreement with the finding that, in non-marine \nsediments, C\n\norg\n is a weaker carrier than the clays and metal \n\noxides.30 Strong correlation with aluminium, moderate to \nstrong correlation with iron, and weak correlation with \nmanganese was observed, demonstrating that inorganic \ncarriers were the main factors controlling metal distributions \nin the sediments. The strong correlations between iron and \naluminium, and between aluminium and the other metals, \nconfirm the principal association of iron with the silt-clay \nfraction, and show that the clays were the main carriers of \n\nFigure 1.

Similar results have been obtained \nfor Australian sediments.30\n\nTrace metal distribution and normalization\n\nPCA was applied to the dataset presented in Table 1, in \norder to identify any trends in the spatial distribution of the \nsediments analyzed. This multivariate statistical technique \nhas previously been shown to be useful in interpretation of \naquatic sediment data.31-33 Here each site was considered \nas an object (15 in total), and the measured parameters as \nvariables (total of 11). In order to ensure that the relative \ninfluences of the different variables on the model were \nindependent of the units used for each variable, the data \nmatrix columns were auto scaled so that the new variable \npossessed a mean of zero and unit variance.\n\nTable 1.

The determining variable was C\norg\n\n,\nwith sediment from site 6 presenting a C\n\norg\n concentration \n\nwhich was much higher than those obtained for sites in \nGroups II and III. From the PCA diagram, it can therefore \nbe concluded that sediments from the Poxim-A\u00e7u, \nPoxim-Mirim and Pitanga Rivers (Group III) possessed \nsimilar chemical characteristics, with the exception of \nsite 15, which is in Group II. Sediments from the Poxim \nRiver (sites 6, 7, 8, 9), and the Pitanga River (site 15), \nwere different from the remainder in that they contained \nhigher concentrations of trace metals. Sites 7, 8, 9 and \n15 are located in a region strongly influenced by urban \nand industrial discharges, so it is likely that the higher \nvalues were due to the presence of metals originating from \nanthropogenic activity. Site 6 is located in a flood plain \nregion. Such areas are characterized by the accumulation of \nsignificant quantities of organic matter,34 which can explain \nthe high sediment C\n\norg\n concentration obtained for this site, \n\nwhich distinguished it from the other Poxim River sites.\n\nIn order to identify possible contamination in the \nsediments, trace metal concentrations were normalized \nrelative to the concentration of a reference element. \nSediments from sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and \n14 were selected as being representative of natural areas. \nOnly sites 7, 8 and 15 were excluded, due to their location \n\nin areas directly influenced by inputs of urban and industrial \neffluents. Identification of the most suitable geochemical \nnormalizer for the study area was achieved by determination \nand comparison of the correlation coefficients (R2) and \nsignificance levels (p) obtained for linear regressions \nbetween the trace metals and either Al or Li. Results \n(Table 3) confirmed the suitability of the selected reference \nsites and showed that lithium was the better normalizer. \nHigher R2 values reflect the greater ability of lithium to \nexplain natural variations in metal concentrations. Despite \nstrong correlation between Li and Al (R2 = 0.83, p &lt;0.0001) \nand their co-existence in the silt-clay fraction, Al showed \nonly moderate to weak correlations with most of the trace \nmetals.\n\nVarious studies3,4,9 have shown lithium to be a better \nnormalizer than aluminium, for sediments composed mainly \nof geologically younger materials, such as variable grain \nsize feldspars. In these sediments, aluminium is present \nin relatively equal proportions in both fine and coarse \nfractions, which results in weak correlation with the trace \nmetals. Lithium is here the better normalizer, because it is \nassociated with the same mineralogical components as the \nmetals, such as primary micas, iron-magnesium minerals, \nand secondary mineral clays, but not with feldspars.9,35\n\nLithium cannot be used to normalize Mn concentrations \n(a non-significant correlation was obtained between these \nmetals), probably because Mn is associated with a different \ngeochemical substrate.\n\nFigures 3a to 3f show plots of the concentrations of \nthe trace metals against lithium, and linear regression \nlines for the reference sites, 95% confidence intervals, \nand the points corresponding to the areas considered to \nbe contaminated (sites 7, 8 and 15). Concentrations inside \nthe 95% confidence intervals are considered to be within \nthe natural variation, while those outside are assumed to \nbe associated with enrichment of the sediment by metal of \nanthropogenic origin. \n\nCo and Cr (Figures 3a and 3b) showed similar \ndistribution patterns, with all sites lying within the 95% \nconfidence limits, except site 7, which showed a small \nenrichment of these metals. Ni (Figure3d) evidenced an \nanthropogenic influence at sites 7 and 15. Cu and Zn \n(Figures 3c and 3f) showed concentrations much higher than \n\nFigure 2.

For \nPb (Figure 3e) all sites lie within the confidence limits, \nexcept site 8 (which shows strong enrichment). Hence metal \nconcentrations in the sediments analyzed can be considered \nto be due to natural origins, except at sites 7, 8 and 15, and \nthe regression lines obtained can be used to define the local \nnatural geochemical baseline.\n\nEnrichment factors (EF) were calculated to quantify the \nanthropogenic impact, as described in the literature,3 using \nthe expression ([metal]/[Li])\n\nsample\n/([metal]/[Li])\n\nbackground\n. To \n\nthe some Li concentration, the metal concentration on \nthe linear regression line was used as background value \nand concentrations lying on the upper 95% confidence \nlimit was used as comparison value. Sediments were \nonly considered to be enriched if the EF exceeded 2, due \nto natural mineralogical variability and uncertainty of \nthe analytical measurements.30 Calculated EFs (Table 4) \nindicate that sediments from sites 7, 8 and 15 were enriched \nin Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, due to inputs from urban and \nindustrial sources. At site 7, enrichment of Co, Ni and Zn \n\nwas moderate (EF &lt;3), while there was strong enrichment \nof Cu (EF > 3). Moderate Pb enrichment was only observed \nfor site 8. Cu and Zn were the elements that showed greatest \nenrichment at the three sites. High concentrations of these \nelements have been observed in sediments located close to \nsewage discharges.36,37\n\nThe geoaccumulation index (I\ngeo\n\n)38 was also used as \na second criterion to identify contaminated sediments \n(Table 5). I\n\ngeo\n is defined by: log\n\n2\n [C\n\nn\n/1.5B\n\nn\n], where C\n\nn\n\nis the measured concentration, and B\nn\n the background \n\ngeochemical concentration of the metal \u201cn\u201d. As reported \nin previous studies,31,39,40 the metal concentration on the \nregression line was used as the background value.\n\nI\ngeo\n\n is based on a qualitative pollution intensity scale, \nwhereby sediments can be classified as unpolluted (I\n\ngeo \n? 0), \n\nunpolluted to moderately polluted (0 ? I\ngeo \n\n? 1), moderately \npolluted (1 &lt;I\n\ngeo \n? 2), moderately to highly polluted \n\n(2 &lt;I\ngeo \n\n? 3), highly polluted (3 &lt;I\ngeo \n\n? 4), highly to \nextremely polluted (4 &lt;I\n\ngeo\n? 5), and extremely polluted \n\n(I\ngeo \n\n> 5).40 According to these criteria, sediments from sites \n1-6 and 9-13 were classified as unpolluted with respect to \n\nFigure 3.

Sediment from site 7 was in the \nunpolluted to moderately polluted category, with respect to \nCo, Cr, Ni and Zn, and in the moderately polluted category, \nwith respect to Cu. For site 8, Pb and Zn were within the \nunpolluted to moderately polluted band, and Cu was in \nthe moderately polluted range. At site 15, Cu and Zn were \nin the unpolluted to moderately polluted category. Hence \nit is clear that the results obtained using the EF and I\n\ngeo\n\nprocedures were in good agreement.\n\nSediment toxicity\n\nThe SQGs have been used as reference tools, to evaluate \nthe extent to which metals associated with sediments could \nadversely affect aquatic organisms.16 Development and \nimplementation of these guidelines reflects a recognition \nof the importance of contaminated sediments as a possible \ncause of adverse environmental impacts.41 Although \noriginally developed for use in North America, the indices \nestablished in these SQGs have been adopted for assessment \nof contaminant concentrations in sediments from various \nregions of the globe.16,32,42,43\n\nIn the absence of toxicological information, the \nconsensus-based SQGs, developed for freshwater \necosystems, were used in the present study to evaluate \nany possible adverse effects, on aquatic organisms, of \nthe metal concentrations measured in the fine fraction of \nsurface sediments. \n\nThe &lt;63 \u00b5m fractions proved to be the most chemically \nactive sediment phase, consisting primarily of clay and \n\nsilt particulates and due to the large specific surface area, \ntypically contains higher concentrations of metals.40\n\nIn order to allow such assessment of toxicity, based on \nSQG values, the trace metal concentrations were determined \nfollowing extraction using nitric and hydrochloric acids (i.e.\nthe partial concentrations), which is a procedure compatible \nwith that used in the development of the SQG. Table 6 shows \nthe concentrations obtained for each metal, together with the \nrespective TEC and PEC values. The highest concentrations \nwere generally obtained for sites 6-9 and 15, however all \nvalues were below the TEC, indicating that adverse effects \non aquatic biota should be unlikely to occur. The value \nnearest to the TEC was obtained for Cu at site 8 (27.9 \u00b5g g-1). \nThe predictive ability of the TEC achieved 72% for Cr \nand Ni, and 82% for Cu, Pb and Zn. This signifies that the \nprobability of the incidence of adverse biological effects at \nconcentrations below the TEC is 28% for Cr and Ni, and \n18% for Cu, Pb and Zn. The predictive ability of the PEC \nwas 94% for Cd, 92% for Cr and Cu, 91% for Ni, and 90% \nfor Pb and Zn. Hence the values of the consensus-based \nPECs for these metals provide a precise basis for prediction \nof toxicity in freshwater sediments.19 It must be emphasized, \nhowever, that SQGs should be used with caution, as there \ncannot be any guarantee of a complete absence of toxicity at \nconcentrations lower than the TECs, or that samples which \nexceed the PECs must necessarily be toxic, particularly \nconsidering that the SQGs were not specifically developed \nfor the biogeochemistry of the region under study. For greater \nassurance, it is important that the results obtained here should \nbe validated using toxicity tests.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe distributions, the factors controlling concentrations \nand the toxicity risks of Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, \nAl and Fe were investigated for surface sediments of the \nfour rivers forming the Poxim river hydrographic sub-\nbasin. Correlation analysis showed that inorganic carriers, \nsuch as clay minerals, were the main factors controlling \nthe distribution of trace metals in the sediments. Lithium \nwas shown to be a better normalizer than aluminium for \ndetermination of enrichment factors, and was used to define \na regional geochemical baseline (RGB) for a majority \nof the metals analyzed. Use of the RGB, together with \nenrichment factors, showed that naturally occurring metals \npredominated in the surface sediment samples studied. \nNevertheless, sediments from sites located in the most \nurbanized region were found to be enriched in Co, Cr, Cu, \nNi, Pb and Zn, due to anthropogenic inputs. Sediments from \nthe studied sites were classified as unpolluted to moderately \npolluted, according to the geoaccumulation index. I\n\ngeo\n.\n\nTable 5.
