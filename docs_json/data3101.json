This\nphenomenon calls for a concept of soil quality, which\nis the capacity of a soil to function within the limits of\nan ecosystem, interacting positively with the\nenvironment external to that ecosystem (Larson &amp;\nPierce, 1991). A soil with good quality fulfils a number\nof functions (carbon storage, water reservoir, nutrient\ncycling, growth medium, among others), while\nsimultaneously protecting other environmental\ncomponents and sustaining human health (Doran &amp;\nParkin, 1994). In this sense, assessing the soil quality\nis one of the main tasks of soil scientists (Basher,\n1997).\n\nHowever, in many regions there is still a lack of\nstudies on soil quality (Reichert et al., 2003). One of\nthese is the hillslope area of central Rio Grande do\nSul (RS), Brazil, with mostly small family farms.\nThese areas were first settled in the late XIX century\nby European immigrants, when native vegetation was\nreplaced by agriculture. Today, farming is based on\nthe integration of crop and livestock. There is little\ninvestment in machinery and fertilizers because of\nthe complex topography, thin soils, small property sizes\nand low income of the farmers. On the other hand,\nhigher-income farms with deeper soils and better road\naccess adopted new and more intensive agricultural\npractices and activities, requiring investments in\nmachinery and fertilizers. But soil conservation\npractices are insufficient, characterizing\nunsustainable agriculture and increasing the potential\nof land degradation (Samuel-Rosa et al., 2011).\n\nThe soil quality assessment has to be based on the\nuse of indicators and indices that reflect soil processes,\nintegrate different soil properties and are sensitive to\nenvironmental changes (Doran &amp; Parkin, 1994). Many\nsoil properties can be included in such soil quality\nindices (Larson &amp; Pierce, 1991; Doran &amp; Parkin,\n1994; Islam &amp; Weil, 2000; Geissen &amp; Guzman, 2006;\nClemens et al., 2010). However, the heterogeneous\ncharacter of soils must also be taken into\n\nconsideration: intrinsic soil properties such as particle-\nsize distribution and the type and content of oxides\nmay vary among land uses. This variation can have\na pronounced effect on the soil properties used to\ndevelop indices of soil quality (Miralles et al., 2009),\nhampering the evaluation of the true effect of land\nuse. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to\nwhich intrinsic soil properties (clay and iron oxide\ncontents) explain variable soil properties (sum of\nbases, potential acidity, organic carbon, total porosity,\nand bulk density) under different land uses (native\nforest, no-tillage and conventional agriculture) on\nsmall family farms in Southern Brazil.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe data used in this study were measured on\nsmall family farms in the hillslope areas of central\nRio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. The local topography\nis complex, with a relief ranging from undulated to\nmountainous. The altitude varies between 240 and\n450 m asl. The climate is classified as Cfa (humid\nsubtropical climate without a defined dry season), with\na mean annual temperature of 19.2 oC and mean\nannual pluvial precipitation of 1,708 mm, quite well\ndistributed throughout the year (Maluf, 2000).\nGeologically, the area consists predominantly of\nigneous rocks. The natural vegetation (Atlantic semi-\ndeciduous forest) is dominated by Patagonula\namericana, Parapiptadenia rigida, Myrocarpus\nfrondosus, Cordia trichotoma, Cedrela fissilis,\nApuleia leiocarpa and Luehea divaricata.\n\nThree land uses were studied:\n\n- native forest: nearly all areas under native forest\ntoday had been used for agriculture in the past\ncentury. European immigrants cleared the original\nnative forest in the late XIX century and practiced\nconventional agriculture for several decades. Since the\n1970s, areas with shallow (<50 cm) and stony soils\nwere gradually abandoned, allowing the regrowth of\nnative vegetation;\n\n- no-tillage: >20 years of conventional agriculture -\ncultivation of potato, Solanum tuberosum - followed\n\n\n\nAlessandro Samuel-Rosa et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 37:1236-1244, 2013\n\n1238\n\nby 4 years of no-tillage - soybean, Glycine max, and\nryegrass, Lolium multiflorum;\n\n- conventional agriculture: >20 years of conventional\nagriculture - mayze, Zea mays, and ryegrass.\n\nThe soils are little weathered. Leptosols prevail in\nnative forest and Acrisols in agricultural areas. The\nmineralogical assemblage of both soil types is similar.\nThe soil clay mineral kaolinite (Kt), common in\nSouthern Brazil, is predominant (K\u00e4mpf &amp; Klamt,\n1978). Besides, other clay minerals were identified,\ne.g., cristobalite, disordered kaolinite or halloysite\no r  b o t h ,  a n d  h y d r o x y - A l  i n t e r l a y e r e d  2 : 1\nphyllosilicates (K\u00e4mpf &amp; Klamt, 1978; Dalmolin et\nal., 2006). There is evidence for the occurrence of a\nsmall amount of hematite. The soils vary in texture\nand differ significantly in clay and iron oxide\ncontents (Table 1).\n\nNine disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were\ncollected from two layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm) for each\nland use, to determine the intrinsic soil properties\nclay and iron oxide contents (Table 1). The clay content\nwas assessed by the pipette method (Kilmer &amp;\nAlexander, 1949), and total free iron oxide (FeDCB)\nextracted by hot dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (Mehra\n&amp; Jackson, 1960). The variable soil properties\npotential acidity, sum of bases (sum of Ca2+, Mg2+ and\nK+), organic carbon, bulk density, and porosity were\nanalyzed. Potential acidity (H+Al) was determined by\ntitration with NaOH after extraction with 0.5 mol L-1\nCa(CH3COO)2.H2O solution at pH 7.0-7.1; Ca2+ and\nMg2+ were quantified by atomic absorption after\n1.0 mol L-1 KCl extraction; K+ was quantified by\nf l a m e  a t o m i c  e m i s s i o n  s p e c t r o m e t r y  a f t e r\n\nextraction with Mehlich-1 solution (Mehlich, 1953);\nand organic carbon was determined by titration\nwith Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2.6H2O after wet digestion with\n0.2 mol L-1 K2Cr2O7 solution (Yeomans &amp; Bremner,\n1988). All methods were described by Tedesco et\nal. (1995) and Donagema et al. (2011).\n\nStatistical analysis was performed in the R\nenvironment (R Core Team, 2013) using frequency\nhistograms, cumulative frequency distribution\ngraphs, and the Cullen and Frey graph to test data\nnormality (Delignette-Muller et al., 2010; R Core\nTeam, 2013). The homogeneity of variances among\nland uses was tested using box plots, standard\ndeviations and Bartlett\u2019s Test (Bartlett, 1954;\nWebster, 2001). The distribution of the intrinsic soil\nproperties was normal in both depth ranges. But for\nsome variable soil properties (potential acidity and\norganic carbon in the upper, sum of bases in the lower\nlayer) skewed distribution and heteroscedasticity were\nobserved. Logarithmic transformation was used to\nachieve normality and stabilize the variances. The\ntransformations altered the correlations between soil\nproperties. The differences between dependent\ncorrelations (before and after transformation) were not\nsignificant at 5 % probability of a type I error using\nWilliams\u2019s Test (Steiger, 1980; Revelle, 2012). To test\nthe hypothesis that the intrinsic soil properties were\nthe same for all three land uses, we used ANOVA\n(analysis of variance) and analyzed the results by\nFisher\u2019s LSDs (least significant differences) for means\nseparation at a probability of 5 % of committing a\ntype I error (Fisher, 1951; Webster, 2007). To test the\neffect of clay and iron oxide content on variable soil\nproperties, we used ANCOVA (analysis of covariance)\n\nLand use Soil order\u00b9 Soil depth Texture Clay Fe\nDCB\n\n(4)\n\n0-10 cm m g kg-1\n\nConventional Haplic Acrisol (Alumic,\n\nHyperdystric, Siltic, Chromic)(1) > 1.0 Silty clay loam 354 (\u00b112) 10.16 (\u00b10.19)\n\nOxic Humudept(2)\n\nCambissolo H\u00e1plico alum\u00ednico \u00fambrico(3)\n\nNo-tillage As above(1) > 1.0 Silty clay loam 282 (\u00b110) 8.75 (\u00b10.17)\n\nNative forest Hyperskeletic Leptosol (Dystric)(1) \u00b1 0.40 Silt loam 240 (\u00b116) 8.95 (\u00b10.17)\n\nLithic Udorthents(2)\n\nNeossolo Lit\u00f3lico\n\ndistro-\u00fambrico fragment\u00e1rio(3)\n\n     5 % LSD(5) 37 0.52\n\n10-20 cm\n\nConventional Silty clay 449 (\u00b128) 11.77 (\u00b10.43)\n\nNo-tillage Silt loam 261 (\u00b116) 9.15 (\u00b10.29)\n\nNative forest Silty clay loam 317 (\u00b121) 8.69 (\u00b10.24)\n\n          5 % LSD 66 0.96\n\nTable 1.

The relation between\nintrinsic and variable soil properties was also analyzed\nusing partial correlations (Revelle, 2012) and\nscatterplots with a 95 % confidence interval of a linear\nfit (Wickham, 2009; R Core Team, 2013). Tables and\nplots are presented according to the latest\ninternational recommendations for statistical results\nin soil science (Webster, 2001; Webster, 2007). Soil\ndata and R scripts are freely available at&lt;http://\nwww.soil-scientist.net>.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe intrinsic soil properties were correlated with\nthe variable soil properties (Table 2). Potential acidity\nis significantly correlated with clay and FeDCB in both\nlayers, but the correlation was strongest in the\nsubsurface. However, the partial correlation (r)\nbetween potential acidity and FeDCB, when the clay\nconstant was fixed, r was only 0.252 in the surface\nand 0.084 in the subsurface layer. Besides, the data\npoints were not evenly distributed in the 95 %\nconfidence interval of the mean in the scatterplots\n(Figure 1), that is, they were stratified according to\nthe land use. Removing data of any land use\nsignificantly altered the correlation between soil\nproperties. An exception is the correlation of clay with\npotential acidity for the subsurface. The ANCOVA\ntable (Table 3) showed that the effect of FeDCB on\npotential acidity was not significant. Clay also played\na minor role, accounting for no more than 5 % of the\ntotal variance, while land use accounted for more than\n80 % in both layers.\n\nSum of bases was negatively correlated with clay\nand FeDCB content (Table 2). However, the partial\ncorrelation of the sum of bases with FeDCB in the 0-10\n\ncm layer at a fixed clay content was only r = -0.295.\nIn addition, data points were not evenly distributed\nin the 95 % confidence interval of the mean in the\nscatterplots (Figure 1). Again, removing data from\nany land use significantly altered the correlation\nbetween soil properties. The ANCOVA results\n(Table 3) showed a minor effect of the clay content on\nthe sum of bases in the surface layer (10 % of the\ntotal variance), and no effect in the subsurface layers.\n\nOrganic carbon correlated negatively with clay\ncontent in the 0-10 cm layer and with FeDCB in the\n10-20 cm layer (Table 2). However, data points were\nstratified in the scatterplots according to land use\n(Figure 1). The ANCOVA (Table 3) showed a minor\neffect of clay on soil organic carbon, accounting for\nless than 5 % of the total variance. Moreover, the effect\nof FeDCB was not significant compared to the effect of\nthe land uses, which accounted for 80 % of the total\nvariance in the 0-10 cm layer and for 36 % in the 10-\n20 cm layer.\n\nBulk density was positively correlated with clay\ncontent in the surface layer (Table 2). However, some\ndegree of stratification of data points according to the\nland use was identified in the scatterplot (Figure 1).\nBesides, few data points were within the 95 %\nconfidence interval of the mean. The ANCOVA showed\nthat clay had no significant effect on soil bulk density\n(Table 4). Land use accounted for more than 80 % of\nthe total variance.\n\nPorosity was negatively correlated with clay\ncontent (Table 2). In the scatterplot, we observed a\nmarked stratification of data points according to the\nland use (Figure 1). Thus, removing data from any\nland use significantly altered the correlations between\nsoil properties. The ANCOVA showed that clay did\nnot affect soil porosity and that land use accounted\nfor more than 85 % of the total variance (Table 4).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nScatterplots and ANCOVA were essential to identify\nthe true correlations between soil properties. The use\nof correlation coefficients alone would have resulted\nin a misinterpretation of the relations between soil\nproperties and led to an overestimation of the effect of\nintrinsic soil properties. In this study, all correlations\nwere statistically significant, however not meaningful,\ne.g., the correlation between clay content and sum of\nbases. Phyllosilicate rich-soils, such as the Leptosols\nand Acrisols studied here, are known to have a net\nnegative charge (Essington, 2004). In this case, a\npositive correlation would be expected between sum\nof bases and clay content. However, conversely, we\nobserved a spurious correlation. An accidental\ncorrelation is one to which no \u201cnatural\u201d causal\ninterpretation can be applied (Haig, 2003).

According to the land-use history, soils\nunder no-tillage are periodically treated with high\nfertilization rates, while in soils under conventional\ncultivation, only a small part of the nutrients exported\nby crops is replaced. On the other hand, in soils under\nnative forest the sum of bases is slightly higher than\nunder conventional agriculture because there is no\nexport of nutrients. Besides, soils under native forest\nare Leptosols, which means that the weathering was\nless intense than of Acrisols, resulting in less leaching\nof bases from the soil profile (Chesworth, 2008). Because\nof all these relations, the variation in the sum of bases\nin these soils is a result of the land-use history (and\nmaybe soil type). Clay and iron oxide content have no\nmajor influence, suggesting that they are not relevant\nin the assessment of soil quality.\n\nThe correlation of intrinsic soil properties with\norganic carbon, bulk density and porosity were\naccidental as well. It is known that clay and iron oxides\ncan play a positive role in organic carbon accumulation\nin soils (Dalmolin et al., 2006). We also expected a\nnegative correlation of clay content with bulk density,\nin the same way as lower clay contents reduce soil\nporosity (Michelon et al., 2007). However, the correlation\nin the studied soils was opposite to the one expected.\nSimilarly to the trend of the sum of bases, the variation\nobserved in organic carbon, bulk density and porosity\nwas mainly affected by the land-use history.\n\nOnly the correlation between intrinsic soil\nproperties and potential acidity was as expected (Tan,\n2010). However, despite the statistically significant\ncorrelations, ANCOVA showed that clay content had\nonly a minor effect on potential acidity and that FeDCB\nhad none.

Once\nagain there was an accidental correlation, where soils\nwith lower clay content were under a land use (no-\ntillage) that reduced potential acidity. The soils under\nno-tillage were periodically limed. On the other hand,\nsoils with higher clay content were under a land use\n(conventional agriculture) that induced the degradation\nof soil fertility. Under conventional agriculture, the soil\nwas limed more than four years before sampling. In\nturn, soils under native forest were not fertilized or\nlimed and consequently organic matter is the\ncomponent with the greatest impact on availability of\nexchangeable aluminium (Silva et al., 2008) and thus\non potential acidity. Since these soils have higher\norganic carbon content than soils under conventional\nagriculture, the potential acidity will be lower.\n\nOur results showed that under the tested\nconditions, soil properties important for land use such\nas potential acidity, sum of bases, organic carbon, bulk\ndensity, and porosity are affected by the land use. They\nare efficient in reflecting land use and are little affected\nby intrinsic soil properties such as clay and iron oxide\ncontent, suggesting that they can be included in soil\nquality assessments. Our data also indicated that\ndespite statistically significant differences in clay and\niron oxide content among soils, these soil properties\nhave no effect on the results of soil quality\nassessments. Webster (2001) previously stated that\nwhen a difference is considered statistically\nsignificant, it is not necessarily important or\nphysically or biologically meaningful. Our findings\nand those of many other researchers agree with this\nstatement. Mandal et al. (2010) studied Himalayan\nEntisols and Inceptisols with clay contents between\n106 and 172 g kg-1 and found that soil management\nstrongly influenced the soil quality indicators. Marzaioli\net al. (2010) studied sandy loam and loam sandy\nMediterranean soils (clay content 54 - 171 g kg-1) and\nalso observed that any differences in soil quality could\nbe attributed to differences in land use. Similar results\nwere found by Schipper et al. (2010), who expected to\nfind fewer changes in organic carbon after 40 years\nin Andisols in New Zealand than in other soil orders\ndue to the remarkable capacity of allophane and\nimogolite to sequester and protect organic carbon\n(Parfitt, 2009). Miralles et al. (2009) found that clay\nand iron oxide contents in soil samples of Leptosols,\nCalcisols, Vertisols, Luvisols, Kastanozems, and\nChernozems (clay content between 219 and 483 g kg-1\nand FeDCB content between 4.4 and 14.1 g kg-1)\nwere weakly correlated with organic carbon (r &lt;0.26,\np = 0.05, n = 68). Percival et al. (2000) studied New\nZealand soils (Andisols, Inceptisols, Ultisols,\nMollisols, Oxisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, Entisols,\nAridisols, and Ultisols) with clay contents from\n38 g kg-1 to 329 g kg-1 and found that carbon contents\ncorrelated poorly with clay content across and within\nsoil orders. According to the authors, the clay content\naccounted for only 1 % of the variation in carbon\ncontent in both cases.\n\nHowever, several studies have shown that intrinsic\nsoil properties can control the expression of other soil\nproperties. In the above-mentioned study, Miralles et\nal. (2009) observed a strong correlation of clay and\niron oxide content with cation exchange capacity,\nporosity and bulk density. Likewise, Dieckow et al.\n(2009) compared a clay Ferralsol (clay: 711 g kg-1;\nFeDCB: 87.6 g kg-1), a sandy clay Ferralsol (clay: 360 g\nkg-1; FeDCB: 48.3 g kg-1) and a sandy clay loam Acrisol\n(clay: 220 g kg-1; FeDCB: 11.8 g kg-1) and observed that\nclay and iron oxide contents were strongly correlated\nwith organic carbon. According to Dieckow et al.\n(2009), in terms of organic carbon losses, the\nconversion of native vegetation to cropland is less\nharmful in clayey than in sandy soils, possibly\nbecause of a chemical and physical protection.\n\nThe inconsistency of the findings of different\nresearchers shows the need for further research on\nthe role of intrinsic soil properties in the control of\nthe effect of land uses on soil properties included in\nsoil quality assessments. Meanwhile, we can suggest\nthat textural classes should not be used as isolated\ntools to describe the heterogeneous character of soils\nand to explain the effects of intrinsic soil properties on\nother chemical and physical soil properties. Our study\nshows that despite the soil classification in different\ntexture classes, the clay content has no apparent effect\non other chemical and physical properties. Whenever\npossible, the information on intrinsic soil properties\nshould be used as a continuous (clay content) and not\nas a discrete variable (textural class). Therefore,\nANCOVA becomes highly relevant in the assessment\nof the extent to which chemical and physical soil\nproperties can be explained by intrinsic soil properties\nunder different land uses and thus affect soil quality\nassessments. Future studies must focus on the\nidentification and definition of clay and iron oxide\ncontent ranges and other oxides in soils that affect\nthe behavior of soil chemical and physical properties\nused in soil quality assessments in different ways.\n\nFinally, a general recommendation for studies on\nlittle weathered 1:1 and 2:1 phyllosilicate rich-soils\nwith a similar mineralogy as in the soils of this study.\nIf the difference between the maximum and the\nminimum clay content under different land uses is\nless than about 200 g kg-1 and the iron oxide content\nless than approximately 15 g kg-1, the physico-\nchemical soil properties in the surface layer (0-20 cm)\nare determined mostly by the land use and history.\nThe effect of intrinsic soil properties is negligible and\nonly detectable in deeper layers (>20 cm), where\nmanagement practices have less effect.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. Organic carbon content, sum of bases, potential\nacidity, bulk density and porosity are easy measureable\nsoil properties, reflect the land use and are little\n\n\n\nTHE EFFECT OF INTRINSIC SOIL PROPERTIES ON SOIL QUALITY ASSESSMENTS                     1243\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 37:1236-1244, 2013\n\naffected by intrinsic soil properties (clay and iron\noxides). This suggests that they can be included in\nthe assessment of the soil quality on small family\nfarms.\n\n2. Despite the classification of soils in different\ntexture classes, intrinsic soil properties (clay and iron\noxide contents) may have no effect on other chemical\nand physical soil properties. Whenever possible,\ninformation on intrinsic soil properties in soil quality\nassessments should be used as continuous rather than\nas discrete variables.\n\n3. For little weathered 1:1 and 2:1 phyllosilicate\nrich-soils, if the difference between the maximum and\nthe minimum clay content under different land uses\nis less than about 200 g kg-1 and the iron oxide content\nless than about 15 g kg-1, the physico-chemical soil\nproperties in the surface layer are determined mostly\nby the land use.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Richard Webster, at the\nRothamsted Research Centre, whose comments were\ndecisive to improve our work.
