However, in order to obtain accurate lifetime expectancies \n\nand performance of the coatings it is necessary to have a complete reliable understanding of \n\ntheir properties. \n\nThis thesis is on the improvement of the surface properties and integrity of molds, in \n\norder to increase their durability, through the application of different types of coatings. Two \n\nmethodologies were followed to reach such demands: (i) optimization of coatings currently \n\nused in molds surface protection (Ni-based alloys deposited by Plasma Transferred Arc - \n\nPTA); (ii) synthesis and characterization of new coatings with improved functionalities, \n\ndeposited by emergent deposition processes such as APS - Atmospheric Plasma Spraying \n\n(effect of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on Ni-based alloy coatings) and DCRMS - Direct \n\nCurrent Reactive Magnetron Sputtering (influence of V additions on the properties of \n\nTiSi(V)N thin films). \n\nThe dilution of the substrate in PTA process was shown to strongly influence the \n\nstructure and, consequently, the hardness, the oxidation resistance and the tribological \n\nbehavior of the coatings; with increasing dilution, a detrimental effect on these properties was \n\nobserved due to the incorporation of base material. However, in relation to the tribological \n\nbehavior, a beneficial effect at high temperature was demonstrated due to the fast formation of \n\noxide layers which protect the coating surface against wear. The post-weld heat treatment \n\nperformed at coatings reduced the hardness of the partially melted and heat affected zones \n\nwithout affecting the coatings hardness; whereas the coatings hardness and wear resistance \n\nwas improved with annealing treatment. Thus, the best performing coating could only be \n\nachieved by a proper selection of the deposition conditions, in order to get the best \n\ncompromise between mechanical properties, high temperature oxidation behavior and wear \n\nresistance of the coatings. \n\nThe impact promoted by nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the microstructure of a Ni-\n\nbased alloy depended on the way how the coatings were deposited by APS process, using: (i) \n\nnanostructured ZrO2 and Ni-alloy powders previously mixed by mechanical alloying or (ii) \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\niv \n\nthe same powders supplied separately. A homogeneous and compact microstructure with \n\nsmall zirconia particles evenly distributed in the matrix was achieved in the first case, while a \n\nporous microstructure, full of semi-melted Ni powders with large particles of ZrO2 entrapped \n\nin their boundaries, suggesting a brittle behavior, was deposited in the second. In both cases \n\nthe hardness and wear behavior of ZrO2 rich coatings were improved in relation to the Ni-\n\nbased alloy. The coatings deposited from mechanically alloyed powders revealed to be much \n\nmore tribologically performing due to their compact structure and even distribution of \n\nzirconia particles. All the APS coatings showed higher hardness values than the Ni-based \n\ncoatings deposited by PTA; however, their micro-abrasion resistance was worse, due to the \n\nlack of cohesion between the powders. \n\nThe analysis by XRD of the structure of V rich TiSi(V)N coatings, deposited by \n\nDCRMS, revealed that V incorporation in the TiSiN system shifted the peaks to higher \n\nangles, indicating the formation of a substitutional solid solution based on TiN phase, where \n\nTi atoms are replaced by the smaller V ones. On the other hand, by similar reason, XRD of \n\nTiSiN films revealed that a nanocomposite structure consisting of TiN grains enrobed by a Si-\n\nN matrix was not formed. In fact, with Si addition a shift of the diffraction peaks of TiN phase \n\nto higher angles was observed which, in combination with similar compressive residual \n\nstresses, also supported the formation of a substitutional solid solution. V additions showed to \n\nsuccessfully improve the hardness and tribological behavior of TiSi(V)N films, as a result of \n\nthe substitutional solid solution formation. On the other hand, the formation of the V2O5 phase \n\nduring the sliding contact acts as a lubricious tribo-film, protecting the coating against wear. \n\nThe addition of Si or V strongly influenced in opposite directions the oxidation resistance of \n\nthe coatings. Si incorporations in TiN increased significantly the oxidation resistance of the \n\nfilms, whereas the opposite occurred in V containing coatings. In this latter case, the rapid V \n\nions out-diffusion through the oxide scale inhibited the formation of a continuous protective \n\nsilicon oxide layer, which is responsible for the excellent oxidation behavior of TiSiN films. \n\nV rich coatings showed lower oxidation resistance than PTA-deposited Ni-based coatings, but \n\nsuperior hardness values and better tribological behavior was found in relation to both PTA \n\nand APS deposited coatings. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Glass Industry, Molds surface protection, Ni-based thick coatings, TiSi(V)N thin \n\nfilms, self-lubricant coatings. \n\n \n\n\n\nResumo \n\nv \n* PTA \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Plasma Transferred Arc \n\n** APS \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Atmospheric Plasma Spraying \n\n*** PVD \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Physical Vapor Deposition \n\nResumo \n\nFrequentemente s\u00e3o aplicados diferentes tipos de revestimentos em moldes e \n\nacess\u00f3rios para a ind\u00fastria do vidro, de forma a atenuar a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o das suas superf\u00edcies, \n\ndevida \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es extremas de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o, corros\u00e3o, abras\u00e3o e desgaste a que est\u00e3o sujeitas. \n\nDeste modo, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel, diminuir os custos de manuten\u00e7\u00e3o e aumentar o tempo de vida e a \n\nefic\u00e1cia destes componentes. No entanto, de forma a maximizar o desempenho dos \n\nrevestimentos, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio compreender a inter-rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as suas carater\u00edsticas e \n\npropriedades funcionais. \n\nEsta tese \u00e9 dedicada \u00e0 melhoria das propriedades da superf\u00edcie dos moldes, de forma a \n\naumentar a sua durabilidade e desempenho, atrav\u00e9s da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes tipos de \n\nrevestimentos. No sentido de enfrentar este desafio, foram seguidas duas metodologias \n\nalternativas: (i) otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o de revestimentos j\u00e1 utilizados na prote\u00e7\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie de moldes \n\n(ligas \u00e0 base de Ni depositadas por PTA* (plasma de arco transferido); (ii) s\u00edntese e \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de novos revestimentos mais resistente e com melhores propriedades, \n\ndepositados por processos de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o emergentes no mercado, tal como s\u00e3o os casos do \n\nAPS** - proje\u00e7\u00e3o em plasma atmosf\u00e9rico (efeito da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de ZrO2 nanoestruturada numa \n\nliga \u00e0 base de n\u00edquel) e do PVD*** - deposi\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica em fase de vapor (influ\u00eancia da adi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde V nas propriedades de revestimentos cer\u00e2micos do sistema TiSi(V)N). \n\nA dilui\u00e7\u00e3o do substrato, promovida pelo processo PTA, mostrou influenciar a estrutura \n\ne, consequentemente, diminuir a dureza, a resist\u00eancia \u00e0 oxida\u00e7\u00e3o e a resist\u00eancia ao desgaste \u00e0 \n\ntemperatura ambiente dos revestimentos \u00e0 base de Ni. No entanto, teve um efeito ben\u00e9fico no \n\ncomportamento tribol\u00f3gico a temperaturas elevadas, permitindo a r\u00e1pida forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma \n\ncamada de \u00f3xido, que protege a superf\u00edcie contra o desgaste. O tratamento t\u00e9rmico efectuado \n\naos revestimentos ap\u00f3s deposi\u00e7\u00e3o reduziu a dureza das zonas termicamente afetada pelo calor \n\ne parcialmente fundida. Al\u00e9m disso, o tratamento de envelhecimento realizado aos \n\nrevestimentos permitiu aumentar a sua dureza e a sua resist\u00eancia ao desgaste. Assim, o \n\nrevestimento com melhor desempenho s\u00f3 pode ser obtido selecionando criteriosamente as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o que originam o melhor compromisso entre propriedades mec\u00e2nicas, \n\ncomportamento \u00e0 oxida\u00e7\u00e3o a alta temperatura e resist\u00eancia ao desgaste. \n\n\n\nResumo \n\nvi \n* PTA \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Plasma Transferred Arc \n\n** APS \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Atmospheric Plasma Spraying \n\n*** PVD \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Physical Vapor Deposition \n\nA adi\u00e7\u00e3o de zirc\u00f3nia nano-estruturada \u00e0 liga de n\u00edquel depositada por APS tem um \n\nimpacto diferente na microestrutura dos revestimentos, consoante s\u00e3o usados p\u00f3s de Ni e \n\nZrO2 previamente misturados por s\u00edntese mec\u00e2nica ou os mesmos p\u00f3s alimentados \n\nseparadamente. Quando depositados com os p\u00f3s preparados por s\u00edntese mec\u00e2nica, os \n\nrevestimentos exibiram uma estrutura homog\u00e9nea e compacta com pequenas part\u00edculas de \n\nzirc\u00f3nia uniformemente distribu\u00eddas na matriz de Ni. Por outro lado, quando depositados \n\nseparadamente foi obtida uma estrutura muito porosa com p\u00f3s de Ni semi-fundidos e com \n\npart\u00edculas de ZrO2 inseridas na sua interface, sugerindo um comportamento fr\u00e1gil. \n\nIndependente do procedimento de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o, em ambos os casos a dureza e a resist\u00eancia ao \n\ndesgaste dos revestimentos foi melhorada com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de ZrO2. Contudo, os revestimentos \n\ndepositados usando p\u00f3s produzidos por s\u00edntese mec\u00e2nica revelaram possuir melhor \n\nperformance, devido \u00e0 sua estrutura compacta e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o uniforme da ZrO2. Todos os \n\nrevestimentos depositados por APS revelaram possuir valores de dureza superiores aos \n\nrevestimentos depositados por PTA; no entanto, a sua resist\u00eancia \u00e0 abras\u00e3o mostrou ser \n\nbastante inferior devido \u00e0 falta de coes\u00e3o entre os p\u00f3s. \n\nAs an\u00e1lises de difrac\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X realizadas aos filmes TiSi(V)N ricos em V \n\nrevelaram que os picos de difrac\u00e7\u00e3o se deslocam para \u00e2ngulos superiores com o aumento do \n\nteor em V, sugerindo a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3lida substitucional, com o V de menor \n\nraio at\u00f3mico a substituir \u00e1tomos de Ti na estrutura de base do TiN. Por outro lado, a an\u00e1lise \n\nrealizada aos revestimentos de TiSiN revelou que a estrutura nanocomp\u00f3sita (gr\u00e3os de TiN \n\nenvolvidos numa matriz de Si-N) n\u00e3o foi alcan\u00e7ada. Com efeito, a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de Si ao sistema \n\nTiN tamb\u00e9m deslocou os picos de difrac\u00e7\u00e3o para \u00e2ngulos superiores o que, considerando o \n\nmesmo n\u00edvel de tens\u00f5es residuais medidos em todos os revestimentos, indicou a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\numa solu\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3lida substitucional onde os \u00e1tomos mais pequenos de Si substitu\u00edram os \n\n\u00e1tomos de Ti na rede do TiN. A adi\u00e7\u00e3o de V ao sistema TiSiN permitiu melhorar as \n\npropriedades mec\u00e2nicas e tribol\u00f3gicas devido \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o da solu\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3lida substitucional. A \n\nmelhoria das propriedades tribol\u00f3gicas est\u00e1 relacionada com a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da fase V2O5, no \n\ntopo da superf\u00edcie do filme, que age como lubrificante s\u00f3lido e, portanto, protege o \n\nrevestimento do desgaste. A resist\u00eancia \u00e0 oxida\u00e7\u00e3o de revestimentos ricos em Si e V mostrou \n\nser influenciada em sentidos contr\u00e1rios por estes elementos. Assim, a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de Si ao sistema \n\nTiN aumentou significativamente a resist\u00eancia \u00e0 oxida\u00e7\u00e3o dos filmes enquanto a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de V \n\nao sistema TiSiN promoveu uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o abruta na resist\u00eancia \u00e0 oxida\u00e7\u00e3o. Esta \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o da resist\u00eancia \u00e0 oxida\u00e7\u00e3o foi atribu\u00edda \u00e0 r\u00e1pida difus\u00e3o dos i\u00f5es de V atrav\u00e9s da \n\n\n\nResumo \n\nvii \n* PTA \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Plasma Transferred Arc \n\n** APS \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Atmospheric Plasma Spraying \n\n*** PVD \u2013 Do ingl\u00eas \u2013 Physical Vapor Deposition \n\ncamada de \u00f3xido formada, que inibiu a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma camada cont\u00ednua e protectora de \n\n\u00f3xido de sil\u00edcio, contrariamente ao que acontece nos revestimentos TiSiN.

Introduction \n\nThe necessity for higher performance and increased efficiency of components working \n\nin extreme harsh conditions has been met with the use of more advanced materials. Coatings \n\nhave been developed over the last decades as a potential solution for these applications due to \n\ntheir superior properties when compared to bulk materials, allowing extending the \n\nperformance and lifetime of components. This was the case of the glass industry, where the \n\ncomponents are actually coated with hard and wear resistant materials in order to resist to the \n\ndirect contact with the melted glass which promotes very severe abrasion, corrosion and \n\nfatigue at high temperature. The current European glass container market is approximately 30-\n\n40 billions of containers. Due to globalization, there has been a growing demand for glass \n\ncontainers production at reduced costs, with increasing shape complexity, putting an \n\nincreasing pressure on glass producers who are seeking molds which allow increasing \n\nproduction rates with higher quality. In these very harsh conditions, further degradation of the \n\nmold surfaces occurs due to more intense thermal cycles leading to higher mechanical strains \n\nand plastic deformation with the consequent fatigue, oxidation and wear problems. \n\nFurthermore, other common problems such as worn-out geometries or surface and base \n\nmaterial cracks, often lead to the breakdown of the coating after few working cycles. The \n\ncombined effect of the harsh conditions with a faulty design or a defective material, \n\nassociated with bad working practices, induces the premature failure of the components. \n\n\n\nChapter I - Introduction \n\n2 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nBesides the direct costs of the molds, there is a direct impact on the production due to the \n\nincreasing machine down times, higher process instability, poor product quality and higher \n\nmaintenance costs. Therefore, any optimized solution to achieve the best performance of \n\nmolds should be focused on the proper selection of the base material, the coating and its \n\ndeposition process. Unfortunately, the lack of credible solutions have limited the application \n\nof coated components in glass industry, hiding the great relevance and impact they could have \n\nfor the industrial development in this area. Thus, this thesis is devoted to the improvement of \n\nsurface properties and integrity of molds, in order to improve their durability, through either \n\nthe optimization of conventional coatings currently applied on mold surfaces or the \n\ndevelopment of new coating systems deposited by emergent technologies. Both cases show \n\npotential to over-support the in service conditions of the molds, allowing improving their \n\nratability, lifetime and performance. \n\nPresently, the molds for glass industry are manufactured either in low cost materials, \n\nsuch as cast iron and low carbon steel, offering a good relative performance at high \n\ntemperature, or in copper-nickel alloys (bronze), due to their excellent thermal conductivity \n\ncombined with reasonable hardness and wear resistance, which allow an increasing \n\nproduction rate of glass containers. In some cases, specific zones of the molds are coated, \n\nmainly with Fe, Co or Ni-based alloys, with the aim of increasing their service life, owing to \n\ntheir excellent oxidation and mechanical performance under high temperature conditions. \n\nSeveral hardfacing and thermal spraying processes have been used to coat the molds: i) \n\nPlasma Transferred Arc (PTA), and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) and ii) Flame \n\nSpraying (FS) and High Velocity oxy Fuel (HVOF), respectively. Hardfacing processes have \n\nbeen preferentially used in the protection of molds surface, due to the strong metallurgical \n\nbond promoted between the coating and substrate, condition required to avoid the catastrophic \n\nfailure in service. In thermal spraying processes only a mechanical bonding is established.  \n\nAmong the hardfacing processes referred above, PTA has been the most versatile and \n\nused, due to its ability to deposit very thick coatings with low porosity and high production \n\nrates. However, the final quality of coatings is largely influenced by the process parameters; \n\ntheir incorrect selection leads frequently to problems such as the formation of porosity or \n\ncracks in both the coating and the substrate, lack of adhesion of the coating to the substrate \n\nand changes in the chemical composition of the coating metal alloy, compromising the \n\nperformance in service. Hence, a reliable understanding of the influence of the deposition \n\nparameters on the coatings properties is required, in order to optimize the lifetime \n\nexpectancies and performance of the coatings. Presently, the tendency is to increase the \n\n\n\nChapter I \u2013 Introduction \n\n3 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\ndilution of the substrate to avoid adhesion problems and, therefore, not to compromise the \n\nmolds life, even if the mechanical properties, oxidation resistance and wear performance are \n\ndeteriorated. This will be the first issue in discussion in this thesis: how the increase in \n\ndilution of the base material (cast iron), induced by the change in arc current, influences the \n\nproperties of Ni-based coatings deposited by the PTA process.  \n\nAn alternative route to improve the quality and performance of molds is the use of \n\nnew, thick or thin coatings deposited by emerging technologies that can lead to significant \n\nimprovements on the mechanical properties. Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) and \n\nPhysical Vapor Deposition (PVD) are good examples of these deposition processes which \n\nallow to achieve either metallic, ceramic or composite coatings. Such technologies and \n\nmaterials have shown already to be potential candidates for improving the performance of \n\nmechanical components and parts used in other industries where high oxidation, corrosion \n\nand wear resistances are required. When compared to traditional deposition processes (PTA, \n\nGTAW and FS), their main disadvantage is related to their high cost of investment and \n\nproduction and, in some cases, lower coatings adhesion. Therefore, any development on this \n\nfield for molds protection should be focused on solutions that withstand the severe conditions \n\nto which molds are submitted, extending their service life sufficiently, in order to justify their \n\nhigher cost. This is the second part of this thesis: new solutions based on thick and thin \n\ncoatings, deposited by APS and PVD processes, respectively. In the first case, the influence of \n\nnanostructured ZrO2 additions to Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS process was \n\nstudied. The idea of this study was to take advantage of the high hardness and oxidation \n\nresistance of ZrO2 to improve the oxidation resistance and the mechanical and wear properties \n\nof Ni-based coatings. In relation to other thermal spraying processes, such as HVOF, APS \n\nwas selected due to its high potential to deposit materials with high melting temperature \n\n(which is the case of ZrO2), although lower particles velocities are achieved; furthermore, in \n\nrelation to the PTA process, APS normally gives rise to coatings with much higher hardness. \n\nApart from the higher cost, the main disadvantage of APS coatings is the need of their \n\nsubsequent fusion when applied in parts for the glass industry, in order to obtain compact and \n\nmore performing coatings; the application of this operation is not covered in this thesis.  \n\nOn the other hand, PVD technique has been extensively used to develop new coating \n\nmaterials, due to its versatility. This process allows \"sweep\" the chemical composition of a \n\ncoating system composed by two or more chemical elements, by changing the deposition \n\nparameters, producing small quantities of material that can be characterized in order to \n\noptimize the best formulation. Moreover, in comparison to thick coatings, PVD allows the \n\n\n\nChapter I - Introduction \n\n4 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\ndeposition of films with much better properties, particularly the mechanical properties, for \n\nwhich it is common to have improvements of two to four times. However, despite the \n\nexcellent properties of the films and the versatility of the process, its application in \n\ncomponents for the glass industry has been postponed, since the much smaller thickness, in \n\nthe micrometer order, has been seen unattractive to the industrial eyes when compared to \n\nthick coatings. However, the experience gained in the application of such PVD films in other \n\nfields of the metalworking industries (for example in machining, stamping, etc), where the \n\nlife-time of the coated parts has been easily increased by one to two orders of magnitude, \n\nallows predicting the success of these films in the protection of molds surfaces for the glass \n\nindustry. Over the last decades a large number of films (ceramic and composite) have been \n\ndeveloped for high temperature applications, among which the most studied systems were \n\nnitrides, carbides and oxides of Ti, Cr or Al, whose properties (mechanical, oxidation, \n\ncorrosion, wear, etc) have been successfully improved by the addition of other chemical \n\nelements. One of the biggest advantages of thin coatings over thick ones is the possibility of \n\nusing ceramics as protection material. In fact, ceramic materials cannot be used in the surface \n\nprotection of molds for glass parts, due to their low thermal conductivity, which impede the \n\nefficient cooling of the base material, decreasing the productivity of the process. This \n\ndifficulty can be overcome if these materials are deposited as thin coatings.  \n\nIn this thesis, the addition of a specific element (vanadium) to ceramic films (TiSiN), \n\ndeposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering, was studied. TiSiN is one of the best PVD \n\ndeposited coatings for high temperature applications and, with V incorporation, it is expected \n\nto improve the mechanical properties and, at the same time, make them self-lubricant at high \n\ntemperatures. Currently, in the glass containers production, the walls of the molds are \n\nfrequently wet with liquid lubricant to avoid the adhesion of the melted glass to the molds \n\nsurface facilitating the removal of glass containers. Frequently, these lubricants (graphite \n\nbased lubricants) contain small amounts of sulfur which combined to oxygen forms sulfuric \n\nacid that erodes the mold surfaces creating holes and, therefore, defects that lead to the \n\npremature failure of the mold. Although V additions have been reported to improve the \n\nmechanical properties and the tribological performance of some binary and ternary coating \n\nsystems, at high temperature V rapidly diffuses to the surface leading to the loss of its \n\nlubricious effect after a critical short time. Hence, TiSiN system was selected due to its very \n\nhigh oxidation resistance, similar to the ternary systems CrAlN and TiAlN, where V \n\nincorporation was already studied, but with much better mechanical properties. Moreover, if \n\ndeposited with a nanocomposite structure (TiN grains embedded in a Si3N4 matrix) by \n\n\n\nChapter I \u2013 Introduction \n\n5 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nchanging the thickness of the antidiffusion barrier Si3N4 matrix, the control of V diffusion can \n\nbe achieved.  \n\nThus, the objectives of this research can be summarized as follows: \n\n \n\ni) To analyze the effect of the arc current variation on the substrate dilution and, therefore, on \n\nthe chemical composition, microstructure, oxidation and tribological performance of Ni-based \n\ncoatings deposited by PTA process over gray cast iron. The influence of an annealing \n\ntreatment on the morphology, mechanical properties, and wear performance of coatings will \n\nbe also discussed. \n\n \n\nii) To study the influence of the addition of nanostructured ZrO2 to Ni-based coatings, \n\ndeposited by APS process, on their microstructure, mechanical properties and tribological \n\nperformance. The properties of the composite coatings will be compared with those of the \n\nunmodified Ni and nanostructured ZrO2 coatings. \n\n \n\niii) To study the influence of V additions on the microstructure, mechanical properties, \n\noxidation and tribological behavior of TiSi(V)N thin films, containing different Si and V \n\ncontents, deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. The properties of the V rich \n\ncoatings will be compared with TiSiN, TiN and TiVN coatings deposited as reference; special \n\nattention will be focused on the oxidation mechanisms occurring during high temperature \n\nexposure. \n\n \n\nTaking into account these objectives, besides this introductory part, this thesis is \n\norganized in six chapters. In chapter II, a historical perspective is presented about the main \n\nproblems addressed in molds for glass containers production, as well as on the main materials \n\nand protection processes currently and possible use on their fabrication. In chapter III, IV and \n\nV, the main achievements resulting from the experimental work on the deposition and \n\ncharacterization of the coatings will be analyzed in relation to the three deposition techniques \n\nabove presented. Finally, in chapter VI the outputs of this thesis, a comparative synthesis and \n\ndiscussion of all the results and future research topics will be presented. \n\nThe structure of the thesis is based on a short presentation and synthesis of the \n\nresearch work performed in the scope of each deposition technique, which is further \n\nsupported by the papers already published and/or under submission by the author. The \n\nchapters dedicated to the experimental studies are as follows: \n\n\n\nChapter I - Introduction \n\n6 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nChapter III is dedicated to establish the correlations between the process parameters of \n\nNi-based coatings deposited by PTA and the chemical composition, morphology, structure, \n\nmechanical properties (hardness), oxidation resistance, mechanisms of oxidation, structural \n\nand morphology evolution after annealing and tribological behavior (evaluated by micro-scale \n\nabrasion and pin-on-disc-tests) of the coatings. This chapter is supported by the papers \n\npresented in annexes A to E. \n\nChapter IV is focused on the study of the influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions \n\non the wear resistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS. This analysis includes \n\nthe characterization of structure, morphology, mechanical properties and tribological behavior \n\n(evaluated in a reciprocating sliding pin-on-disk equipment and micro-scale abrasion) of the \n\ncoatings. This chapter is supported by the paper in Annex F. \n\nChapter V is concentrated on the analysis of TiSiN films deposited by DC reactive \n\nmagnetron sputtering with different Si and V contents. The influence of V on the chemical \n\ncomposition, structure, mechanical properties, residual stresses, oxidation resistance and \n\nmechanisms of oxidation, thermal stability and tribological performance of the coatings is \n\naddressed.

Historical perspective \n\nGlass was discovered by the Phoenicians around the year of 3000 BC. The history tells \n\nthat glass was discovered when these explorers lit fires near the beaches and observed the \n\nchanges occurring to the sand under the action of the intense heat of the fire. Time passed and \n\nRomans began to master the technique of glass production being able to produce some \n\nrudimentary bottles, intended for the storage of a large variety of liquids. Over the following \n\ncenturies, glass containers progressed significantly from the design point of view, having been \n\nregarded as a luxury item in the middle age. At that time, only few wealthiest families used \n\nglass containers to the storage of perfumes and other liquids. The industrialization of glass \n\ncontainers started in England in the year 1600 when the coal was introduced as a solid fuel. \n\nThe glass containers were originally produced manually, but due to the increasing market \n\ndemand associated to technological development, in the XIX century glass production started \n\nto be mechanically automated. Glass containers were seen as an ecologic and versatile \n\nproduct, giving rise to their rapid expansion through the market. Since then, to achieve the \n\nrequired higher production rates to satisfy the market needs, the use of more advanced \n\nmaterials was always the preferred solution. During the 20th century, materials science and \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n10 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\ntechnology knowledge was introduced in the industry and, from the second half of the \n\ncentury, researchers and engineers poured a part of the materials development efforts on the \n\nmodification of materials surface through coatings application. Their superior properties when \n\ncompared to bulk materials, allowed extending the performance and lifetime of components \n\nworking in severe conditions. Since then, application of coatings has been one of the preferred \n\nways to modify the surface of materials permitting to extend their use to new potential \n\napplications. \n\nIn glass industry, molds and accessories are in direct contact with the melted glass \n\n(temperature about 1050 \u00baC) being submitted to very severe abrasion, corrosion, wear and \n\nfatigue at high temperature. Molds, mouthpieces and plungers used for glass production are \n\nshown in Figure 2.1. These mechanical components started to be produced in gray cast iron \n\nand low carbon steel due to their relatively good high-temperature performance, allowing \n\nkeeping a fairly acceptable thermal conductivity, at an extremely low cost [1, 2]. In fact, the \n\nfunctionality of these materials was not only to support the severe environment high-\n\ntemperature conditions but also to provide an efficient heat transfer which allows to rapidly \n\ncool down the melted glass in order to either decrease the time of containers production or \n\nobtain products without glass distorting under its own weight [2, 3]. Therefore, later on, \n\ncopper-alloys (bronze-aluminum) have been introduced as mold material due to their superior \n\nthermal conductivity combined with good properties of hardness and wear resistance [4]. \n\nThese materials allowed increasing production rates, despite of their much higher cost when \n\ncompared to the previous ferrous alloys. Independently of the mold material, some cooling \n\nchannels and fins had been performed in some components in order to help the heat \n\nextraction.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - Components used in glass containers production. \n\n1\n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n11 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nThe higher oxidation and wear resistance required at high temperatures (HT) for \n\nachieving higher production rates, in order to satisfy market demands, led to the application of \n\nnew high performing bulk materials, such as Ni cast alloys, that allowed extend service life of \n\ncomponents [5, 6]. However, despite of their excellent performance at high temperature, their \n\nprice of acquisition/production was extremely high which have hindered their widespread \n\napplication in glass industry. Nevertheless, their attractive properties at high temperatures \n\npushed to overcome the cost barrier by their application under the form of thick coatings on \n\ncomponents fabricated in cheaper base materials. Currently, the molds are made in a low \n\nperforming low cost material (such as the mentioned above, i.e. cast iron, low carbon steel \n\nand copper alloys) but coated in specific zones with hard and more resistant HT alloys, \n\nallowing to support the harsh service conditions [2, 3, 7, 8]. The base material provides the \n\nnecessary mechanical strength to resist to the overall applied loads and the thermal fatigue, \n\nwhereas the coatings allow extending these properties to an upper end of their performance \n\ncapabilities while protecting them against wear, corrosion, oxidation, abrasion, etc [9, 10]. \n\nEven if the material withstands high temperature conditions without coating, the life period of \n\nthe component can be enhanced. In conclusion, the advantages of coatings application can be \n\nsummarized as follows [9, 11, 12]: \n\n \n\n? Cost of the coating is significantly lower than that of a component integrally fabricated \n\nin HT alloys. \n\n? Unique structures and microstructures can be achieved in coatings which are not \n\npossible in bulk materials.  \n\n? Very high flexibility concerning the chemical composition of the deposited material \n\nallowing the best selection and consequent optimization for a specific \n\nsolicitation/application. \n\n? With coatings, surface properties can be improved keeping the required mechanical \n\nproperties in the bulk of the structural component. \n\n \n\nA wide variety of coating materials, such as cobalt, iron and nickel alloys, has been \n\nsuccessfully used to extend the working life of molds [2, 13-15]. The selection of the \n\nappropriate coating composition depends on the environment to which the coating is exposed \n\nand the substrate on which it is applied. The complexity of interactions between environment, \n\ncoating and substrate makes the design and selection of coatings very hard and, in general, a \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n12 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\ncompromise should be achieved between the mechanical strength, the corrosion/oxidation \n\nresistance and the adhesion. Among the above referred coatings, nickel-based superalloys \n\nhave gained an important role for the protection of surfaces of components for the glass \n\nindustry, due to their excellent performance under conditions of abrasion, corrosion, wear and \n\noxidation at elevated temperature, at a reasonable low cost [16-19]. Ni alloys typically used in \n\nmolds protection are divided into two groups: chromium-containing and chromium-free, e.g \n\nNiCrBSi and NiBSi, respectively. The chromium containing alloys are characterized as low \n\nCr (~8 wt%), medium Cr (~11 wt%) and high Cr (~20 wt%) [20]. The alloys compositions \n\ncan be varied in order to optimize specific properties, such as the tribological behavior, the \n\noxidation resistance, the wettability, etc. Nickel, as the base element of Ni-based alloys, is \n\nresponsible for the excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance at high temperature [21, 22]. \n\nOther properties can be achieved with alloying elements. B is added to reduce the melting \n\npoint of these alloys (concentrations up to 2.5 wt%) favoring the manufacturing ability [22, \n\n23]. Silicon increases the self-fluxing properties, the castability and the wetting characteristics \n\n[22]. Both B and Si act as deoxidizers, forming borosilicate phases, which prevent the \n\noxidation of the active elements in the alloys [24]. B and C react with chromium to produce \n\nhard borides and carbides and, hence, rising the cavitation and wear resistance of the coatings \n\n[25, 26]. Cr and Al form chromia and alumina which improve the protection of the coatings \n\nagainst oxidation [27, 28]. The addition of hard and stable carbides and oxides, such as WC, \n\nCrC, SiC, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, etc, is used to improve their tribological performance \n\n[29-33]. In conclusion, this wide range of compositions makes these alloys very versatile, \n\nallowing to achieve the desired properties for a particular application.  \n\nCeramic coatings have been extensively applied in components submitted to extremely \n\nhigh temperature conditions due to their superior properties when compared to metallic \n\ncoatings [24-36]. However, their use as thick coatings in the protection of parts for the glass \n\nindustry is limited due to their extremely low thermal conductivity. This is a fundamental \n\nparameter for the productivity, which can determine the selection and the applicability of any \n\nsolution in glass molds. As it will be referred later, the applicability of ceramic materials can \n\nonly be envisaged if this shortcoming is overcome. In order to take advantage of the excellent \n\nhigh temperature properties of ceramic materials, the only solution is to deposit them in the \n\nform of thin films. An emergent deposition process able to satisfy this requirement is the PVD \n\ntechnique. \n\nIndependently of the base material and the coatings on it applied, the failures in the \n\nmolds during service depend on a high number of factors, loading conditions and functional \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n13 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nrequirements. Whenever a failure occurs, the most important factor is not the cost of the \n\ncomponent but the costs due to machine down time, process instability and poor production. \n\nTherefore a proper design and fabrication procedure of the molds, as well as their appropriate \n\nuse in service, should be carefully analyzed. The factors that lead to the molds failure are the \n\nthermal and mechanical strains, the wear plastic deformation, the thermal fatigue and the \n\naction of the oxidative, abrasive and corrosive environments occurring in service conditions \n\n[37-39]. The synergetic effect of the harsh conditions with a faulty design, a defective \n\nmaterial or bad working practices is the perfect combination to induce the premature failure of \n\ncomponents, expressed as: worn-out geometries, plastic deformation, surface and bulk \n\nmaterial cracks, breakdown of the coatings. For example, the presence of sharp corners, \n\nnotches and sudden changes in the cross section should be avoided in molds design. They act \n\nas hot spots which potentiate the failure by thermal fatigue, wear and cracking due to the high \n\ntemperature there reached [38, 40, 41]. With the components of molds being constantly \n\nheated and cooled down during glass containers production, large thermal gradients are \n\ncreated causing the mold tension during heating and compression during cooling down [37, \n\n42]. Thus, surface cracks are frequently produced resulting in a poor product surface \n\nfinishing. Moreover, if the thermal expansion coefficients of the base materials and the \n\ncoatings are very different, cracks can appear on either base material, base material/coating \n\ninterface or, even, only in the coating, leading also to the mold failure. Thermal shock is also \n\nreported as a cause for premature mold failure [37, 38]. In conclusion, the increase of molds \n\nlifetime, the improvement in glass containers quality, the decrease in the rejection rate and the \n\nreduction of costs production can only be achieved through a convenient selection of new \n\nmaterials (substrate and coatings), the optimization of molds geometries, application of \n\ninnovative processes of deposition and adoption of new working practices. \n\nAs it was referred to in Chapter I, the main processes used to apply coatings to protect \n\nthe mold surfaces in glass industry, are: (i) hardfacing processes such as Plasma Transferred \n\nArc (PTA) or Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), and (ii) thermal spraying processes such \n\nas Flame Spraying (FS) and High Velocity Oxy Fuel (HVOF). Ones more than the others, in \n\ngeneral, these processes often lead to problems of adhesion of the coating to the substrate, \n\nhigh rate of porosity (5-15%), high residual stresses, excess of dilution with the consequent \n\nchanges in microstructural and functional properties of the coatings and base materials, in all \n\ncases compromising the performance of the molds and the final quality of the produced parts \n\n[43-47]. FS is the oldest process used for depositing coatings on molds for the glass industry, \n\nsince it is simple, easy to be applied and of low cost when compared with other deposition \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n14 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nmethods. However, the adhesion of the coating to the substrate is very low and it presents a \n\nhigh level of porosity, which frequently reduces significantly the life time of the molds in \n\nservice [9]. To avoid adhesion problems, hardfacing processes have been preferentially used \n\n(GTAW and PTA), since they promote a strong metallurgical bond between the coating and \n\nsubstrate, condition required to avoid their catastrophic failure in service. This technique \n\ngives rise to much better results than thermal spraying processes, for which the adhesion is \n\nonly due to a mechanical bonding. GTAW process deposits thicker coatings with lower \n\nporosity and high production rates than flame spraying [48]. However, it is generally \n\nrestricted to flat or horizontal surfaces. On the other hand, PTA process produces better \n\nresults than GTAW in terms of efficiency and quality of the coatings, at a lower cost. It is a \n\nvery versatile process allowing depositing any kind of material, with lower porosity at a \n\nhigher production rate than FS and GTAW [49-52]. This process assures a deep penetration of \n\nthe coating material into the bulk substrate with a narrow heat affected zone and a relatively \n\nsmall weld bead due to its high velocity plasma jet when compared to GTAW. However, it is \n\nnot portable and cannot be used to coat complex forms, being its main disadvantages. \n\nPresently, PTA is being increasingly used in components for glass industry, mainly on the \n\nmold edges, zone submitted to a high abrasion by the hot plasticized glass. Furthermore, \n\ndespite the good adhesion promoted by the hardfacing processes due to the formation of a \n\nmetallurgical bond, in some cases this can be a disadvantage. In fact, to reach high adhesion \n\nvalues it is frequently necessary to increase the level of dilution of the base material with the \n\ncoating. Such a procedure leads to changes in the chemical composition of the deposited filler \n\nmetal, which can compromise the properties of the coatings and their performance in service. \n\nHence, a proper selection of the deposition parameters should be carefully done to accomplish \n\nthe commitment between the requirements of mechanical strength, corrosion/oxidation \n\nresistance and adhesion [44]. Normally, coatings with thickness in the range of 2 - 5 mm are \n\napplied in the molds surfaces with these processes.  \n\nHVOF process provides coatings with higher hardness than PTA do, since it allows \n\nhigher cooling rates which promote refined microstructures [9, 53, 54]. Furthermore, owing to \n\nthe high energy of the particles jet, better mechanical interlocking can be achieved with the \n\nconsequent increase of the bond strength of the coatings to the substrate in relation to FS \n\nprocess; however, it continues significantly lower than that of the hardfacing processes [55]. \n\nAs this process is based on the spraying of powders in the melted state over a cooled \n\nsubstrate, the heat affected zone of the base material remains very low, avoiding the formation \n\nof brittle phases resulting from the metallurgical melting process occurring frequently in \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n15 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nhardfacing processes, which lead very often to failure problems by cracking. The main \n\ndisadvantage of this process is the need of fusion of the coating after deposition, since the \n\nrapid cooling down of the powders from the melted state does not allow a good intermixing \n\namong them and a \u201cpoor\u201d cohesion of the particles is normally achieved. HVOF allows to \n\ndeposit uniform coatings (without dilution) keeping heat extraction conditions uniform in the \n\nentire molds surface, which is a required condition to evenly cool down the glass containers \n\nand, therefore, to produce glass parts without defects. HVOF is being used to coat critical \n\ncomponents in the glass industry, for example the plungers shown on the right in Figure 2.1, \n\nwhere an efficient and uniform heat transfer is required [2, 3, 8]. The typical thickness of the \n\ncoatings for molds surface protection is in the range of 100 - 500 \u00b5m. A summary of the main \n\nand typical characteristics of thermal spraying and hardfacing processes is shown in Table \n\n2.1. \n\nTable 2.1 - Comparison of the characteristics of several hardfacing and thermal spraying processes [9, 55-60]. \n\nDep. \n\nprocess \n\nMaterial \n\nfeed type \n\nSpray gun \n\ntemperature \n\n(\n0\nC) \n\nTemperature reached in \n\nthe electric arc (\n0\nC) \n\nParticle \n\nvelocity \n\n(m/s) \n\nRelative \n\nbond \n\nstrength \n\nPorosity \n\nlevel \n\nvol.% \n\nDep. rate \n\n(Kg/h) \n\nFS Powder 3000 - 30-120 Fair 10 - 15 1 - 10 \n\nGTAW Wire - 6000-11000 - Excellent 0.01 - 20 6 \n\nPTA Powder - 12000-18000 - Excellent 0.1 - 1.5 8 \n\nHVOF Powder 4000 - 2000 \nGood to \n\nExcellent \n0.1 - 2 2 - 12 \n\n \n\nRecently, other deposition techniques, such as Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) \n\nand Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), have emerged, showing a promising potential for \n\napplication in glass industry. APS process is a thermal spraying process very similar to HVOF \n\nsince both are based on the projection of melted powders towards the substrate [61, 62]. \n\nHowever, whilst in HVOF process the material in the form of powder is heated based on the \n\ngeneration of a hot flame obtained by combustion of gases, in APS process melting is \n\npromoted by the powder injection into a very high temperature plasma generated by a \n\ndischarge, where it is rapidly heated and accelerated. The main advantage of the APS process \n\nis the much higher temperatures that can be reached in the plasma, making it suitable to \n\ndeposited materials of high melting points, as it is the case of cermets and ceramics [59]. In \n\nHVOF the temperature reached is around 4000 \u00baC and the particle velocity 2000 m/s, while in \n\nplasma spraying the temperature reaches 20000 \u00baC and the velocity 400 m/s. However, the \n\nvery high temperatures and lower velocity occurring in the APS process results in coatings \n\nwith microstructures containing oxides, nitrides and, also, some porosity as well as lower \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n16 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nadhesion to the substrate. Despite these disadvantages, APS deposition of cermet and ceramic \n\ncoatings was shown in some cases to lead to much better properties than when they are \n\ndeposited by HVOF [59]. Thus, the use of the APS process to deposit either the previous \n\nreferred cermet coatings (Ni-based alloys reinforced with stable carbides and oxides), which \n\nare normally used to improve the wear behavior, or new cermet coating systems, should be \n\ntaken into account. In spite of the extremely high number of studies regarding the effect of \n\ncarbide and oxide additions on the tribological behavior of Ni-based alloys, no reports have \n\nbeen published regarding the effect of nanostructured zirconia additions on their properties. \n\nPresently, pure tetragonal zirconia coatings are one of the main materials used on the turbine \n\nblades surface protection due to their extremely high performance at high temperature [63-\n\n66]. As in glass industry, such material cannot be used as pure coating to protect the mold \n\nsurfaces due to its very lower thermal conductivity; however, owing to its high level of \n\nhardness, wear and oxidation resistance, its use as reinforcement material in Ni-based alloy \n\ncoatings should be considered. \n\nPVD is a process of deposition of thin films (thickness in the range from few to \n\nthousands nanometers) that produces coatings with outstanding mechanical properties. It is \n\ncommon in this process, depending on the coating system, to deposit films with two to four \n\ntimes better mechanical properties than those of the thick coatings described above. The \n\napplication of this technique to protect molds for the glass industry is still embryonic, since \n\ntheir much smaller thickness seems, at industrial eyes, unpromising and unattractive when \n\ncompared to that of thick coatings. However, in other industries, where parts are submitted to \n\nextreme high temperature and mechanical loading conditions, these coatings have shown to \n\nsuccessfully increase the life-time and performance of the coated parts, in some cases in more \n\nthan one or two orders of magnitude [67-73], allowing predict a potential use of these films to \n\nprotect glass molds surfaces. From the development point of view, this technique has been \n\nshown to be very versatile. It easily allows scan the chemical composition of a coatings \n\nsystem, containing one or more elements, permitting the optimization of the deposition of a \n\nspecific film, i.e. the coating with the best compromise between e.g. mechanical, tribological, \n\noxidation and corrosion properties. Moreover, it allows overcoming the problems of using \n\nceramic coatings in molds protection. In fact, the lower thermal conductivity of the ceramics \n\nmaterials can be avoided if the thickness of the non-thermal conductive film is very low. The \n\nmain disadvantages of this process are its high investment and production costs, although in \n\nsome cases the latter can be decreased. In fact, using PVD process some steps of the molds \n\nproduction can be removed (for example post-deposition machining tasks, see Table 2.2 for \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n17 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nmore detail) and, depending on the mold dimensions, several parts can be coated at the same \n\ntime. Therefore, sometimes the final cost of molds production can reach values similar to \n\nthose achieved with thick films processes. Finally, it should be taken into account the costs of \n\nglass containers production. On the one hand, the much better properties of thin films in \n\ncomparison to thicker ones, may envisage an extended lifetime of the components and \n\ntherefore, even if the cost of mold surface protection is higher, the final production costs can \n\ndecrease. On the other hand, due to the very low thickness, the possibility of an increased heat \n\nextraction, during glass forming process, gives rise to either important savings in energy, \n\ndecrease of the production times or improvement of the final quality of the produced parts. \n\nTable 2.2 - Typical sequential tasks used in molds production. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDeposition processes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFS GTAW PTA HVOF APS PVD \n\nO\np\n\ne\nra\n\nti\no\n\nn\ns \n\n Base material machining x x x x x x \n\nOpen of U-shaped grooves for \n\n coating deposition \nx x x - - - \n\nCleaning x x x x x x \n\nGrit blasting - - - x x - \n\nCoating deposition x x x x x x \n\nMachining x x x x x - \n\nCleaning x x x x x - \n\nRemelting - - - x \nyes if cermets - \n\nno if ceramics - \n\nPolishing - - - x x - \n\n \n\nIn the last decades, the development of thin coatings for mechanical applications was \n\nconcentrated in solutions that could ensure simultaneously the specifications required for a \n\nlonger lifetime and an increased productivity, high hardness and high toughness, associated \n\nwith high thermal resistance, which should accomplish the desired excellent tribological \n\nbehavior at high temperatures. The first generation of hard coatings was concentrated in \n\nsingle carbides, nitrides and oxides (e.g. TiN, WN, TiC, AlN, WC, Al2O3) [67, 74-76]. The \n\nfollowing generations comprised the mixed compounds, such as TiCN, WCN, (TiAl)N, \n\nTiSiN, etc. [77-81] and the multilayer and multiphase structures (TiN/NbN, TiN/AlN, TiN/W, \n\nWN/Ti, TiSiN, TiBN) [80, 82-84]. Finally, super hard coatings were developed as for \n\nexample, c-BN, c-B4C, etc [85, 86]. In all these cases, the extension of the lifetime and \n\nperformance of the coated components was successfully achieved.  \n\nThe development process of hard coatings based on transition metal nitrides started \n\nwith single nitrides, such as TiN and CrN, which have been widely used as protective \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n18 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\ncoatings [87-90]. However, the need for using these coatings in more severe and demanding \n\nenvironments (particularly, at high temperature applications) led to their alloying with \n\nchemical elements that could in anyway improve their thermal behavior; here multi-element \n\nnitride films appeared [91, 92]. The most known of these is TiAlN, which has higher \n\nmechanical strength and oxidation resistance than TiN [93, 94]. The entire range of Ti/Al \n\nratios was scanned and, globally, the use of very high Al/Ti ratio gives rise to a significant \n\nimprovement of the oxidation resistance at high temperatures [95, 96]. With the same aim, \n\nimprovement of the oxidation resistance, the addition of Cr to TiN film has also been \n\nextensively studied [92, 97, 98]. Cr was better in some situations, Al or Si were in others. \n\nTherefore, development of quaternary (e.g. TiAlCrN, TiAlSiN, CrAlSiN) and higher (e.g. \n\nTiAlCrSiN) systems, was performed by the incorporation of other elements such as Si, B, Cr, \n\nAl [71, 99, 100]. Among the ternary coatings, TiSiN was one of the most extensively studied \n\n[101, 102]. Depending on the deposition conditions, these coatings have been reported \n\nconsisting of: i) nano-sized TiN crystallites surrounded by a Si-N amorphous matrix [103-\n\n105], or ii) substitutional solid solution of Si in TiN structure (not predicted by the Ti-Si-N \n\nphase diagram) [103, 106, 107]. Their main advantage in relation to previous ternary coatings \n\nis the much higher hardness values that can be achieved, between 40 and 50 GPa, for the same \n\nlevel of oxidation resistance, particularly if a nanocomposite structure is deposited [95, 103, \n\n108]. \n\nCurrently, during glass containers production, liquid lubricants are used to avoid the \n\nadhesion between the molds surface and the melted glass. In service, most of the lubricant is \n\nvolatilized, due to the high temperatures, promoting the glass adhesion to the surface and, \n\nthus, accelerating the wear of the component and giving rise to poor quality in the produced \n\nparts. Furthermore, these lubricants contain commonly small amounts of sulfur which, \n\ncombined to oxygen, forms sulfuric acid that erodes the mold surfaces creating holes and \n\nleading to the premature failure of the mold. Thus, the use on mold surfaces of solid \n\nlubricants, instead of the liquid ones, is of great interest, since their low vapor pressure and, \n\nhence, sublimation does not occur so easily. A wide range of solid lubricant coatings have \n\nbeen developed in the last decades and successfully applied in tribological components. Solid \n\nlubricant coatings such as WC/C, MoS2, diamond-like carbon (DLC), hex-BN, etc, as well as \n\ntheir combination in nanocrystalline or multilayer structures, are some examples [70, 109, \n\n110]. However, considerable degradation of the tribological effectiveness of these coatings at \n\nhigh temperature has been reported due to their low oxidation resistance. To overcome this \n\nshortcoming, new concepts of lubrication have been proposed. Solid lubricants for high \n\n\n\nChapter II - Historical Perspective \n\n19 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\ntemperature applications can be divided into three categories [111-113]: (i) soft metals (e.g. \n\nAg, Cu, Au, Pb, and In); (ii) fluorides (e.g. CaF2, BaF2, and CeF3); and, (iii) metal oxides (e.g. \n\nV2O5, Ag2Mo2O7). These coatings were developed by combining the intrinsic properties of \n\nsome binary or ternary coatings, that are resistant to oxidation, with specific elements in order \n\nto get the lubricious properties.  \n\nAll the above three types of solid lubricants materials plastically deform and/or form \n\nlow-shear-strength surfaces at elevated temperatures, characteristics responsible for the \n\nlubricious effect. Among them, special attention has been given to the coatings based on the \n\nformation of lubricious oxides, being vanadium the preferred element, reason why particular \n\nattention has been given to the vanadium-containing coatings with the expectation of \n\nformation of Magn\u00e9li phases VnO3n?1. These coatings showed interesting tribological \n\nproperties in the temperature range 500 \u2013 700 \u00baC [70, 114-119]. Various series of V rich \n\ncoatings have been developed, such as ternary (V,Ti)N [120], CrVN multilayered AlN/VN \n\n[121] and quaternary single layer or multilayered CrAlVN [122, 123] and TiAlVN [116, 124-\n\n126]. A detailed description of the effect of V additions on the mechanical, tribological and \n\noxidation, properties of these coatings can be found in a recent paper review published by \n\nFranz et. al [127]. In summary, the most important conclusions of these studies are: (i) the \n\nrelative amounts of V2O5 detected at the oxidized surface of V rich films successfully \n\ndecreases the wear rate and friction coefficient of the coatings; (ii) a strong out-diffusion of V \n\nsignificantly degrades the oxidation resistance of the coatings; (iii) the out-diffusion only \n\npermits a short time efficiency of solid lubrication with the V-oxides.  \n\nThe control of the V out-diffusion is now one of the major challenges to reach an \n\nadequate oxidation resistance and suitable tribological properties without compromising the \n\noriginal properties of the host binary and ternary films. One of the possible proposals to solve \n\nthis problem will be to use coatings systems composed by a dual phase, in which one of the \n\nphases act as a diffusion barrier to vanadium. This can be the case of TiSiN system. If \n\ndeposited as a nanocomposite structure (nano-sized TiN crystallites surrounded by an \n\namorphous matrix of Si3N4), the Si-N phase may work as an anti-diffusion barrier [128] and, \n\ntherefore, if V is incorporated in solid solution in the lattice of the TiN grains, the controlled \n\nrelease of V can be achieved. By tailoring the nanostructure of the Ti-Si-N films, i.e \n\nproducing coatings with different Si-N layer thickness, the V out-diffusion can be controlled \n\nas well as its release as oxide in the coatings surface. An alternative method would be to \n\ndeposit a multilayer structure with Si-N layers of increasing thicknesses from the top to the \n\nbottom of the coating. \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n21 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter III \n\n3.

Introduction \n\nThis chapter is dedicated to the analysis of the effect of the arc current variation on the \n\nmicrostructure, hardness, oxidation performance, structural and morphology evolution after \n\nannealing and tribological behavior of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process, and is \n\nsupported by the publications presented in the Annexes A to E. \n\nThe effect of the PTA current variation on the microstructure and hardness of the \n\ncoatings is presented in annex A. The microstructural changes in the coatings as well as in the \n\nrespective heat affected zones were analyzed in this paper. Further, the effect of a post-weld \n\nheat treatment (PWHT) on the microstructure and hardness of the coatings and base material \n\nwas also examined as well as their wear performance evaluated in micro-scale abrasion. This \n\nmethod was selected to reproduce the main wear mechanism (3 body abrasion) identified in \n\nthe surface of molds which have been in service for long time, although it does not allow \n\nconsider the high temperature effect. An exhaustive investigation of the test conditions that \n\nproduce such kind of wear mechanism was carried out and it is detailed in the paper of Annex \n\nD. The wear resistance of the coatings, in particular their abrasion resistance was evaluated \n\nbefore and after annealing in order to understand the effect of temperature on the wear \n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n22 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nperformance of the coatings (publication in Annex C). The influence of the heat treatment on \n\nthe hardness and microstructure of the coatings was also discussed. The high temperature \n\ntribological behavior of the coatings was assessed in a pin-on-disc tribometer (publication in \n\nAnnex E). Besides the effect of the increasing dilution on the wear behavior of the coatings at \n\nroom and increasing temperatures, the base material used in the molds production (gray cast \n\niron) was also investigated. The publication in Annex B is dedicated to the study of the effect \n\nof substrate dilution on the oxidation behavior of coatings. The oxidation mechanisms \n\noccurring during coatings heat treatment were also discussed in this paper. \n\nThe experimental procedure and conditions adopted for the coatings deposition and \n\ncharacterization are described in detail for each specific investigation on the papers of the \n\nannexes. In the following sections, the main results achieved are summarized. \n\n3.2. Microstructure and hardness of the coatings \n\nNi-based coatings were deposited by PTA process, using the same process parameters \n\nwith exception of the arc current, on flat surfaces of gray cast iron blocks in order to study the \n\neffect of substrate dilution on their properties. The following arc currents were used: 100 A \n\nfor specimen 1, 128 A for specimen 2 and 140 A for specimen 4. Further, the edges of a block \n\nwith a machined U-shaped groove were coated with the same parameters of specimen 2 \n\n(specimen 3).  \n\nThe effect of the arc current variation on the dilution of the coatings is shown on the \n\nmacrographs displayed in Figure 3.1. With the arc current increase in the range 100 - 140 A, \n\nthe dilution steadily increased from 28% to 59%. Both flat and U-shaped groove machined \n\nspecimens revealed to have similar dilution and macrostructures suggesting that the \n\ndeposition conditions on flat surfaces blocks could be extrapolated to molds. As it would be \n\nexpected, the increasing dilution had a significant influence on the chemical composition of \n\nthe coatings, being the main changes related to the decrease of the Ni content and the increase \n\nof Fe, Si, C and Mo contents, in good agreement with the chemical composition of the base \n\nmaterial. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n23 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Dilution induced by PTA process using different weldments: specimen 1 - 100 A, specimen 2 and 3 \n\n- 128A, specimen 4 \u2013 140 A. \n\nAfter deposition, four distinct regions could be observed on the cross section of the \n\ncoatings, as follows: the fusion zone (FZ), which corresponds to the coating material (the \n\nnickel alloy), the partially melted zone (PMZ), which is the area close to the FZ where \n\nliquation can occur during weld, the heat affected zone (HAZ), which is not melted but \n\nundergoes microstructural changes, and the base material (BM) which structure remains \n\nunaffected by the deposition process. In all the cases the fusion zone showed a dense \n\nmicrostructure, free of microcracks and few solidification voids. Increasing substrate dilution \n\nwas shown to reduce the content of porosity in the coatings, correlated with the refinement of \n\nthe dendritic microstructure (Figure 3.2). The microstructure consisted of dendrites of a Ni-Fe \n\nsolid solution phase aligned along the direction of the heat flow. Furthermore, torturous grain \n\nboundaries were displayed, with C flakes (dark-floret structures) evenly distributed in the \n\nmatrix. The large number of C flakes on the microstructure was attributed to the dilution of \n\nthe base material. Moreover, the dendritic structure became finer as the arc current and, \n\ntherefore, dilution increased. \n\nFor higher arc currents the heat input during deposition increased, being expected a \n\ncoarsened microstructure; however, an opposite behavior was witnessed. According to the \n\nWDS maps (wavelength dispersion spectroscopy) of the most abundant elements of the \n\ncoatings, the refinement of the dendritic structure was attributed to the higher number of \n\nprecipitates and C-flakes in the grain boundaries, due to substrate dilution. In fact, these \n\nphases normally segregate in the grain boundaries, which increased the rate of heterogeneous \n\ntransformation during solidification, hindering the grain growth. A detailed analysis in the \n\nelements distribution with increasing dilution can be confirmed in Annex A.  \n\nAccording to X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-deposited coatings, the major phases \n\nof their structure were primarily (Ni, Fe) face centered cubic solid solution, with the \n\noccurrence of N3Si, Cr5B3 and Fe3Mo3C phases. This phase distribution was in good \n\nagreement with the elemental maps distribution drawn for the coatings. Moreover, according \n\nSpecimen 1 Specimen 2 Specimen 3 Specimen 4\n\n28% 50% 54% 59%\n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n24 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nto WDS analysis, other precipitates such as C-B, and Mo-C were also observed in the grain \n\nboundaries, contributing to the microstructure refinement, although they were not detected by \n\nXRD analysis, probably due to their small size and/or content. Close to the interface \n\ncoating/base material, a cellular microstructure, finer than the dendritic structure, was \n\nobserved for all the specimens (see Figure 3.2 d) for specimen 1). This refinement may be \n\nattributed to the high solidification rates involved owing to the efficient thermal exchange \n\nensured by the high volume ratio substrate/coating. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Optical micrographs of: a) specimen 1, b) specimen 2, c) specimen 4, d) interface of specimen 1. \n\nDespite the previous refinement of the coating microstructure with increasing dilution, \n\nwhich would suggest an increase of the hardness, an opposite trend was registered, i.e. the \n\nhardness of coatings decreased with increasing arc current, as it is shown in Figure 3.3. This \n\nbehavior is undesirable in terms of wear resistance and could only be explained by the \n\nchanges in the chemical composition reported above. In all the cases the hardness throughout \n\nthe melted material revealed to be approximately constant.  \n\nThe highest hardness value was observed close to the interface coating/fusion zone, \n\nmore specifically on the PMZ (538 HV0.5 for specimen 1), being lower with increasing arc \n\ncurrent, which may be favorable in terms of the toughness of that region. This zone has been \n\nC flakes\n\nGrain boundary\n\nPrecipitates\nDeposit material\n\nBase \n\nmaterial\n\nIn\nte\n\nrf\na\n\nc\ne\n\nCircular island\n\na)\n\nc) d)\n\nb)\n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n25 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nfound to be formed by hard cementite and martensite phases which are usually responsible for \n\nthe brittle behavior of Fe-C alloys. The hardness of the HAZ was significantly higher than the \n\nbase material but lower than the PMZ material, as a consequence of the presence of \n\nmartensite and the absence of cementite. The proportion of martensite in the microstructure \n\ndecreased with increasing distance from the fusion line and, thus, the hardness dropped down \n\ntoo. \n\nThe microstructure of heat-affected zones and the induced mechanical properties were \n\ndirectly related to the heat input and, therefore, to the current intensity. The high hardness \n\nvalues found in the PMZ and HAZ made these regions potentially responsible for many of the \n\nmechanical problems occurring in cast iron welds since they were brittle. Thus, a post-weld \n\nheat treatment (PWHT) at 850 \u00baC for 1h was performed to the specimens in order to reduce \n\nthe presence of brittle phases. As can be observed in Figure 3.4 for specimen 4, the heat \n\ntreatment successfully reduced the hardness of the PMZ and HAZ zones down to the base \n\nmaterial values without significant changes of the coating hardness. In this case, PMZ, HAZ \n\nand BM zones were formed basically by a perlitic/ferritic structure, justifying the large scatter \n\nof hardness measurements, as shown in Figure 3.4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Hardness profile across the interface of PTA specimens. \n\n-4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n Specimen 1\n\n Specimen 2\n\n Specimen 3\n\n Specimen 4\n\nHAZ\n\nPMZ\n\nBase material\n\nF\nu\n\ns\nio\n\nn\n l\nin\n\ne\n\nMelted\n\nmaterial\n\nH\na\nrd\n\nn\ne\ns\ns\n H\n\nV\n0\n\n.5\n\nDistance across the interface (mm)\n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n26 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Hardness profile across the interface after PWHT in specimen 4. \n\n3.3. Oxidation resistance and diffusion mechanisms \n\nTwo of the previous coatings (specimens 1 and 3) were held at 800 \u00baC and 900 \u00baC in \n\nair atmosphere during 2 h in a thermogravimetric equipment (TGA), in order to study the \n\ninfluence of the substrate dilution on the oxidation resistance of the coatings. The surface, as \n\nwell as the cross-section, of the oxidized coatings were observed by scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM) and analyzed with both energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and \n\nXRD diffraction. The results are fully presented in Annex B; specimens 1 and 3 were termed \n\nas coatings C100 and C128, respectively. The thermogravimetric analysis revealed that \n\nincreasing the substrate dilution the oxidation resistance of coatings decreased, as shown in \n\nFigure 3.5. This behavior was correlated to the chemical composition changes occurred due to \n\ndilution; in particular due to the high iron content introduced in the coating. As a \n\nconsequence, different oxide phases were detected in the two coatings, although in each \n\ncoating the phases indexed after thermal exposure at 800 and 900 \u00baC were similar. According \n\nto XRD and SEM-EDS analyses performed at the oxidized surface of the coatings, the oxide \n\nphase sets detected at 800 \u00baC and 900 \u00baC were: (i) B2O3, SiO2, Cr5B3 and OAlB for coatings \n\nproduced with lower dilution and (ii) Fe2O3 (hematite), Fe3O4 (magnetite), spinels of \n\nNiFe2O4, and small amounts of NiO, B2O3 and B6O for higher dilution coatings. In the latter, \n\ncarbon particles were also detected. \n\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550  Specimen 4\n Specimen 4 after PWHT\n\nHAZ\n\nPMZ\n\nBase material\n\nF\nu\n\ns\nio\n\nn\n l\nin\n\ne\n\nMelted material\n\nH\na\nrd\n\nn\ne\ns\ns\n H\n\nV\n0\n\n.5\n\nDistance across the interface (mm)\n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n27 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.5 - Isothermal oxidation curves at 800 and 900 \n\n0\nC of the: a) coating deposited using 100 A arc current, \n\nb) coating deposited using 128 A arc current. \n\nMoreover, the analysis performed on the cross section of coatings showed different \n\ntypes of oxide layers after isothermal oxidation. In the coating with lower dilution the oxide \n\nscale showed to be mainly formed by a protective thick layer of Si-O in which small amounts \n\nof a phase rich in Ni, Si, Al and B (Si-O, Ni-Si and Al-B-O phases) were uniformly \n\ndistributed. On the top a B rich oxide was detected too. On the other hand, a dual layer \n\nstructure was formed in the case of the coating with high dilution: an external layer of Fe2O3, \n\nwith small features of Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 spinel rich phases, and an internal Fe3O4 layer with \n\nsmall amounts of an evenly distributed dark phase rich in silicon, nickel and iron. Similar to \n\nspecimen 1, small amounts of B-O were also detected on the top.

Thermogravimetric curves \n\nshowed that the coating with lower dilution displayed a parabolic oxidation weight gain as a \n\nfunction of the time, typical indicating an oxide growth controlled by a protective Si-O layer. \n\nThe coating with higher dilution followed the same trend at 800 \u00baC; however, at 900 \n0\nC two \n\nstages in the oxidation curve were detected, the first with a linear increase in mass gain, has \n\nbeen shown to be a compromise between the outward Fe diffusion through a growing layer of \n\nFe2O3 and the loss of carbon by decarburization and formation of CO2. The second step \n\nobeyed a parabolic law starting at the moment that the oxide scale, above described, thickened \n\nto a critical value impedding the C liberation, leaving the ion diffusion through the scale the \n\nonly mechanism controlling the mass gain. A detailed description of the oxidation resistance \n\nand the diffusion mechanisms occurring with these coatings can be found in Annex B. \n\n3.4. Tribological behavior \n\nThe influence of substrate dilution on the tribological performance of coatings was \n\ninvestigated using two different wear equipments: micro-scale abrasion and pin-on-disc \n\napparatuses. The first equipment was used since it is among wear tests one of the simplest to \n\nreproduce the wear mechanism closest to what is occurring on the surface of molds in contact \n\nwith melted glass (3 body abrasion). However this equipment did not allow high temperature \n\ntesting. Therefore, the high temperature tribological behavior of the coatings was assessed in \n\nanother tribometer (pin-on-disk), although it did not allow reproducing so well the interaction \n\nconditions between melted glass and the surface of molds. \n\n3.4.1. Micro-scale abrasion tests \n\nIn order to use micro-scale abrasion tests to evaluate the effect of substrate dilution on \n\nthe abrasive wear resistance of the coatings, an exhaustive investigation of the test conditions \n\n(different abrasive concentrations, loads and sliding distances) that produces 3 body abrasion \n\nwear mechanism was carried out and detailed in Annex D. It was observed that low loads and \n\nhigher fraction of abrasive slurry enable 3-body abrasion, whilst, 2-body abrasion becomes \n\nstable at high loads and low volume fraction of abrasive slurry. Moreover, it was perceived \n\nthat the specific wear rate essentially depends on the wear rate mechanisms (rolling or \n\ngrooving) involved and not on the test conditions employed, since these do not produce \n\nchanges in the wear mechanism; i.e. different test conditions which produce similar wear \n\nmechanism can be used to calculate the specific wear rate of coatings. The influence of the \n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n29 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nsubstrate dilution on the micro-abrasion resistance of Ni-based coatings was evaluated in \n\nAnnex A and Annex C, using a combination of test conditions that would produce 3-body \n\nabrasion wear mechanism. In both cases the wear results showed that dilution slight decreased \n\nthe wear rate of the coatings (see Figure 3.6), in good agreement with the decrease in their \n\nhardness. However, due to the high concentration of abrasive slurry used (103 g per 1\u00d710\n-4\n\n m\n3\n \n\nin Annex C against 34 g per 1\u00d710\n-4\n\n m\n3\n in Annex A), and owing to the different ball surface \n\npreparation done in Annex C, the wear rate of the specimens revealed to be one order of \n\nmagnitude higher. In addition, the wear scars promoted by the tests revealed the presence of \n\ntwo different wear mechanisms (3-body and 2-body abrasion), although 3-body abrasion was \n\npredominant. Therefore, although a pure 3-body wear mechanism was not produced, as it \n\nwould be expected by the results of Annex D, the tests allowed closely reproduced the wear \n\nmechanism present on the molds surface although the high temperature effect had not been \n\nconsidered. \n\nThe heat treatment performed at specimen 4 (at 500 \u00baC) during 5 and 10 days revealed \n\nnot promote changes in their specific wear rate of coatings. However, sample exposed during \n\n20 days exhibited a lower specific wear rate (see Figure 3.6). This was attributed to the \n\nincreasing of coating hardness with thermal exposure, due to the precipitation of a Ni-P phase \n\nin the coating matrix. A detailed description on the influence of the annealing treatment on the \n\nproperties of coatings can be seen in Annex C. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 - Specific wear rate of Ni-based coatings in as-deposited and annealed conditions from Annex A and \n\nC, evaluated in a micro-scale abrasion equipment. \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nSpec. 4\n\nannealed during\n\n Results from Annex A\n\n Results from Annex C\n\n20\n d\n\nay\ns\n\n10\n d\n\nay\ns\n\n5 \nda\n\nys\n\nSpec. 4Spec. 2Spec. 1\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-4\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\n Annealing results from Annex C\n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n30 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n3.4.2. Pin-on-disc tests \n\nSeveral weld beads of specimen 1 and 4 (different dilutions \u2013 28 and 59%, \n\nrespectively) were deposited in parallel on the flat surface of cast iron blocks, ensuring some \n\noverlapping between them in order to produce coatings large enough to allow perform \n\ntribological tests. The tribological performance of the coatings was evaluated at three different \n\ntemperatures: room temperature, 550 and 700 \u00baC, and compared to the uncoated gray cast \n\niron. Although in the real working conditions of molds glass acts as an abrasive material, due \n\nto its melted state at high temperature, for the tribological tests we have selected as \n\ncounterpart a harder and more resistant material: Al2O3 balls. All the wear tests were \n\nconducted at a constant linear speed of 0.10 m.s\n-1\n\n, a load of 5 N, a relative humidity of \n\n48\u00b15%, and 5000 cycles. The radius of the wear tracks was set to 5.3 mm.  \n\nThe tribological tests revealed that at room temperature, the wear rate of the coatings \n\nwas independent of the substrate dilution and similar to the gray cast iron (see Figure 3.7). In \n\nall coatings the wear was governed by tribo-oxidation. Similar friction values were measured \n\nin all coatings which were understood by the similar wear debris detected on the worn surface \n\nof the coatings, despite of their discrepancy in hardness and chemical composition due to the \n\ndifferent dilution. Gray cast iron showed a similar level of wear rate as Ni coatings at RT in \n\nspite of its lower hardness (2 times lower than the Ni coatings). This was explained by the \n\npresence of graphite on the worn surface, which acting as a solid lubricant led to lower \n\nfriction coefficient and compensated a possible higher wear rate due to the lower hardness.  \n\nThe wear rate of the coatings abruptly increased when tested at 550 \u00baC; however, it \n\ndropped with further increase to 700 \u00baC. Globally, specimen 1 displayed much higher wear \n\nrate than specimen 4 at high temperatures, result that could be interpreted on the basis of the \n\noxidation resistance of coatings. At 550 \u00baC, due to the lower oxidation resistance of the \n\nspecimen 4, a continuous oxide tribo-layer was formed on their worn surface, protecting it \n\nagainst wear. In case of specimen 1, due to its higher resistance to oxidation, the oxidation \n\nrate is reduced. Due to the movement of the ball, the destruction of the growing oxide layer is \n\nrelatively easier, hindering the formation of a stable oxide layer over the surface and, thus, \n\nleading to high wear volumes due to the direct contact between the alumina ball and the virgin \n\ncoating. At 700 \u00baC, the wear rate of both coatings is reduced due to the formation of \n\ncontinuous and thick oxide-layers on the worn surfaces. This was not the trend for gray cast \n\niron for which a monotonous increase of the wear rate with increasing temperature was \n\nobserved. In this case, the very low oxidation resistance of the material allowed an easy \n\n\n\nChapter III \u2013 Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process \n\n31 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nremoval of the tribo-layer and the depletion of graphite from the wear track. This tribological \n\nbehavior is presented and discussed in detail in Annex E.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.7 - Variation of the wear rate of the as deposited PTA coatings and the gray cast iron with testing \n\ntemperature. \n\nIn conclusion, the increase in the arc current, and therefore in the dilution of the \n\nsubstrate, has detrimental effect on the hardness, oxidation resistance and tribological \n\nbehavior of the coatings at room temperature. However, beneficial effect on the high \n\ntemperature tribological behavior was observed due to the fast formation of oxide layers \n\nwhich protect the coating surface against wear. Therefore, the dilution degree should be \n\noptimized in order to get the best compromise between the level of oxidation, wear resistance, \n\nmechanical properties and adhesion to make possible to achieve coatings with the best \n\nperformance. \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n RT\n\n 550 \n0\nC\n\n 700 \n0\nC\n\nCast ironSpecimen 4Specimen 1\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-6\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV \u2013 Influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the wear resistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS \n\n33 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter IV \n\n4. Influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the wear \n\nresistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nThis chapter is dedicated to the study of the effect of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on \n\nthe microstructure, micro-hardness and wear performance of Ni-based alloy coatings, \n\ndeposited by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) on a low carbon steel, and is supported by \n\nthe paper presented in Annex F.  \n\nThe coatings with nanostructured ZrO2 additions were produced by either powders of \n\nNi-based alloy and nanostructured zirconia mixed by mechanical alloying or separate powders \n\nusing a dual powder injection system available at the APS equipment. In both cases, two \n\ncontents of nanostructured zirconia were added to the Ni-based alloy: 20% and 40% in \n\nvolume. All the properties of the coatings were compared, interpreted and discussed in \n\nrelation to either unalloyed nickel or nanostructured zirconia coatings and based on the \n\ndeposition parameters. The coatings produced with powders prepared by mechanical alloying \n\nusing 20% and 40 % of nanostructured ZrO2 were denominated as \u201cNi+20% MA\u201d and \n\n\u201cNi+40% MA\u201d, respectively, and the coatings deposited using the dual system of powder \n\ninjection with 20% and 40 % of nanostructured ZrO2 were designated as \u201cNi+20% Dual\u201d and \n\n\u201cNi+40% Dual\u201d, respectively. \n\n\n\nChapter IV \u2013 Influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the wear resistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS \n\n34 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n4.2. Microstructure and hardness of the coatings \n\nAll the coatings showed a typical morphology of plasma sprayed materials, with pores, \n\nlamellae, and partially/un-melted particles (see Figure 4.1). Ni pure coating displayed a \n\ncompact and homogeneous microstructure (Figure 4.1 a)), while pure ZrO2 coating showed an \n\nextremely high level of porosity with some cracks, resulting from the tensile residual stresses \n\ngenerated during cooling down to room temperature (Figure 4.1 b)). Ni+ZrO2 MA coatings \n\ndisplayed a homogeneous and compact microstructure, with small zirconia particles evenly \n\ndistributed in the matrix, whilst Ni+ZrO2 Dual coatings exhibited a porous microstructure, full \n\nof semi-melted Ni powders with large particles of ZrO2 entrapped in their boundaries \n\nsuggesting a brittle behavior. Nanostructured zirconia additions progressively increased the \n\nhardness of the coatings. However, coatings deposited using powders prepared by mechanical \n\nalloying displayed much higher hardness than Dual coatings (7.0 - 7.6 against 5.4 - 5.9 GPa, \n\nrespectively). This was in good agreement with their lower porosity, higher level of \n\ncompactness and finer and more homogeneous distribution of the nanostructured zirconia. In \n\nrelation to the structure, the main phases detected corresponded to the ones identified in both \n\npure Ni-based and ZrO2 coatings, i.e: Ni, Ni-Cr-Fe, Cr23C6, Cr5B3 and ZrO2. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \u2013 Influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the wear resistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS \n\n35 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - SEM morphology of the: a) Ni-based alloy coating, b) nanostructured ZrO2 coating, c) and d) \n\nNi+20% Dual and Ni+40% Dual, respectively, e) and f) Ni+20% MA and Ni+40% MA, respectively. \n\n4.3. Tribological behavior \n\nThe influence of the nanostructured zirconia addition on the wear behavior of a Ni-\n\nbased coating was studied using reciprocating tribological testing equipment with a ball-on-\n\nplate configuration. A harmonic wave generated by an eccentric and rod mechanism imposed \n\na stroke length of 2.05 mm at a frequency of 1 Hz. A soda-lime glass sphere of 10 mm in \n\ndiameter was used as counterpart, as the most suitable material to study the interaction of \n\nglass with the coatings. All the tests were conducted at room temperature during two hours. \n\nCracksa)\n\nc) d)\n\nb)\n\ne) f)\n\n\n\nChapter IV \u2013 Influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the wear resistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS \n\n36 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nFour different values of normal load were applied to the coated samples and the volume loss, \n\nspecific wear rate and friction coefficient were evaluated.  \n\nZrO2 incorporation successfully decreased the specific wear rate and the friction \n\ncoefficient of the Ni-based coating, independently of the deposition procedure adopted (see \n\nFigure 4.2). However, this trend is more accentuated in Ni+ZrO2 MA than in Ni+ZrO2 Dual \n\ncoatings. Furthermore, increasing ZrO2 content in MA coatings has a decreasing monotonous \n\neffect on the wear rate whereas an inverse trend was observed in Dual coatings for the highest \n\nZrO2 content. Several factors, such as the hardness, the microstructure and the wear \n\nmechanisms occurring during sliding, were used to interpret those different trends in the \n\nspecific wear rates of coatings, as follows: \n\n(i) Ni+ZrO2 MA coatings showed clean wear tracks with longitudinal scratches \n\nidentifying grooving abrasion. Thus, the uniform distribution of small ZrO2 particles, \n\ncombined with the higher hardness and toughness of these coatings, impeded the liberation of \n\nlarge wear debris from the coatings, their plastic deformation and adhesion, leading to low \n\nspecific wear rate.  \n\n(ii) In the case of Dual coatings, the main wear mechanism observed on the worn \n\nsurfaces was of adhesion type, as for pure Ni coating, due to the large areas of nickel exposed \n\nto the counterpart. The semi-melted state of Ni powders, the high level of porosity and the \n\nagglomeration of ZrO2 particles located in-between Ni-based lamellae, made the coatings less \n\ntough, inducing an increase of their wear rate.  \n\n(iii) The increase of nanostructured zirconia from 20 to 40% in Dual coatings, \n\npromoted higher levels of brittleness in the Ni lamellae boundaries, increasing the volume \n\nloss of the material.  \n\n(iv) Pure ZrO2 coating displayed the highest specific wear rate among all the coatings, \n\ndue to its brittle behavior. \n\n\n\nChapter IV \u2013 Influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the wear resistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS \n\n37 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n  \nFigure 4.2 - Specific wear rate of coatings calculated from the reciprocating tribological tests. \n\nThe influence of nanostructure zirconia additions on the abrasion resistance of a Ni-\n\nbased coating was also studied. The tests were performed at the most promising coatings (MA \n\ncoatings) using the same test conditions as for Ni-based coatings in Annex A, with the \n\nexception of the sliding distances, which were adapted based on the wear mechanism. In fact \n\nfor these tests conditions (AISI 52100 steel ball bearing with 25.4 mm in diameter rotating at \n\na speed of 75 rpm under a load of 0.1 N and an proportion of abrasive slurry of 28% (34 g per \n\n1\u00d710\n-4\n\n m\n3\n of silica in water)), sliding distances higher than 400 turns showed produce a \n\nmixed-mode wear mechanism (3-body plus 2-body abrasion). Thus, in order to ensure 3-body \n\nabrasion formation the experiments were performed using lower test durations (50, 80, 150, \n\n200 and 300 rpm). The volume loss plotted as a function of the \u201cload \u00d7 sliding distance\u201d \n\nparameter is plotted in Figure 4.3 and the respective specific wear rate, calculated from the \n\nslope of a straight line fitted to these points, is shown in Figure 4.4. In all cases the main wear \n\nmechanism observed on the wear track was three-body abrasion, in good agreement to the \n\nwear mechanism defined on the surface of molds in real applications. The addition of \n\nnanostructured ZrO2 successfully increased the abrasion resistance of coatings, as above \n\ndemonstrated in the reciprocating tribological tests. However, the specific wear rate values \n\ncalculated with abrasion tests were two to three orders of magnitude higher than those \n\nachieved in reciprocating sliding tests.  \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nN\ni \n+\n\n 4\n0\n%\n\n Z\nrO\n\n2\n M\n\nA\n\nN\ni \n+\n\n 2\n0\n%\n\n Z\nrO\n\n2\n M\n\nA\n\nN\ni \n+\n\n 4\n0\n%\n\n Z\nrO\n\n2\n D\n\nu\na\nl\n\nN\ni \n+\n\n 2\n0\n%\n\n Z\nrO\n\n2\n D\n\nu\na\nl\n\nDual ZrO\n2\n\nNi\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-5\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\nMA\n\n\n\nChapter IV \u2013 Influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the wear resistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS \n\n38 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.3 - Evolution of the wear behavior as a function of the parameter \u201cnormal load \u00d7 sliding distance\u201d. \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.4 - Specific wear rate of coatings, calculated from the slope of a straight line fitted to the points plotted \n\nin Figure 4.3. \n\nAs a global conclusion, it was demonstrated that nanostructured ZrO2 additions \n\nincreased the hardness and improved the tribological behavior of Ni-based coatings. \n\nFurthermore, it was observed that the best properties were achieved when coatings were \n\nproduced with mechanically alloyed powders, which promoted an evenly distribution of ZrO2 \n\nparticles and therefore, an improvement on the mechanical and tribological properties. \n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n Ni\n\n Ni + 20% ZrO\n2\n MA\n\n Ni + 40% ZrO\n2\n MA\n\nV\no\nlu\n\nm\ne\n l\no\ns\ns\n (\n\n1\n0\n\n-2\n m\n\nm\n3\n)\n\nLoad x Sliding distance (N.m)\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\nNi + 40%\n\nZrO\n2\n MA\n\nNi + 20%\n\nZrO\n2 \nMA\n\nNi\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-3\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\n\n\nChapter V - Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering \n\n39 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter V \n\n5.

Introduction \n\nThis chapter is on the study of the effect of V incorporation on the chemical \n\ncomposition, microstructure, mechanical properties, residual stresses, oxidation behavior, \n\nthermal stability and tribological performance of TiSi(V)N thin films, containing different Si \n\ncontents, deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. The results presented in this chapter \n\nare supported by the papers in Annexes G to I. \n\nAnnex G details the influence of V additions on the chemical composition, \n\nmicrostructure, mechanical properties (hardness and Young\u2019s Modulus) and oxidation \n\nresistance of TiSi(V)N coatings. The effect of Si incorporation on the properties of the TiN \n\nsystem was also assessed in this paper, for comparison purposes. The thermal stability and the \n\ndiffusion processes occurring during the annealing of TiSiN and TiSi(V)N films are presented \n\nand discussed in Annex H. Annex I is dedicated to the study of the effect of V incorporation \n\non the tribological behavior of TiSi(V)N coatings at room temperature and its comparison \n\nwith that of TiN, TiVN and TiSiN films prepared as references.  \n\n\n\nChapter V \u2013 Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering \n\n40 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n5.2. Microstructure, residual stresses and mechanical properties \n\nThree series of TiSiN films with different Si contents, each series with increasing V \n\ncontent, were deposited in a d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering machine, set with two \n\nrectangular magnetron cathodes working in unbalanced mode. A Ti target, with holes \n\ndistributed throughout the preferential erosion zone, and a TiSi2 composite target were used \n\nfor the depositions. The different silicon contents were achieved by changing the power \n\ndensity applied to each target and the V content was varied by changing the number of high \n\npurity rods of Ti and V placed in the holes of the Ti target. Three V contents were added to \n\nthe films by using 4, 8 and 12 pellets of V. In all cases the total power applied to the targets \n\nwas 1500 W. To serve as reference, a TiN film was deposited from the Ti target using 2000 \n\nW of power. Ti and TiN interlayers were deposited as bonding layers, in order to increase the \n\nadhesion of the coatings. The interlayer also contained V when V pellets are placed in the Ti \n\ntarget. In all the depositions the time was adjusted in order to obtain coatings with \n\napproximately 2.5 \u00b5m of total thickness (including interlayers). The total working gas \n\npressure was kept constant at 0.3 Pa, using approximately 30 and 17 sccm of Ar and N2, \n\nrespectively. A summary of the studied coatings and the nomenclature for them adopted (used \n\nin Annex G) is shown in Table 5.1. \n\nTable 5.1 - Coatings deposited and their nomenclature. \n\n  \n \n\nIncreasing  V content \n\n \n\n  \nPower (W) \n\n0P V \n\n(0 at.%) \n\n4P V \n\n(~3 at.%) \n\n8P V \n\n(~7 at.%) \n\n12P V \n\n(~11 at.%) \n\nIn\nc\nr\ne\na\nsi\n\nn\ng\n S\n\ni \n\nc\no\nn\n\nte\nn\n\nt \n\n \n\n \nTi 1000 TiSi2 500 \n\nS3-0 \n\n(TiSiN) \n\nS3-4 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\nS3-8 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\nS3-12 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\n \nTi 1200 TiSi2 300 \n\nS2-0 \n\n(TiSiN) \n\nS2-4 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\nS2-8 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\nS3-12 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\n \nTi 1300 TiSi2 200 \n\nS1-0 \n\n(TiSiN) \n\nS1-4 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\nS1-8 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\nS3-12 \n\n(TiSiVN) \n\n  Ti 2000 TiN    \n\n \n\nAs it would be expected, the simultaneous decrease in the power density of Ti target \n\nand its increase in TiSi2 target, allowed producing coatings with increasing Si contents. In a \n\nsimilar way, increasing the number of V pellets allowed to deposit coatings with increasing V \n\ncontents. In all cases, coatings with nitrogen contents close to 50 at.% were achieved. All \n\n\n\nChapter V - Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering \n\n41 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nfilms showed a columnar micro-structure. As Si content was increased, the columns size and \n\nthe surface roughness were firstly reduced and, then, increased for the highest silicon content. \n\nV additions did not change the global type of the cross section morphology.  \n\nAs a general trend, the structure of the films could be assigned to a fcc NaCl-type \n\ncrystalline phase as e.g. TiN (ICDD card 87-0628). The influence of increasing Si content on \n\nthe TiN system and the effect of V content on the TiSiN coating with the lowest silicon \n\ncontent (S1-y series) is shown in Figure 5.1. Concerning TiSiN films, a loss of crystallinity \n\nwas observed for the coating with the highest Si content, suggesting an amorphization of the \n\nstructure. Furthermore, a shift of the diffraction peaks to higher angles was observed with \n\nincreasing Si content, suggesting the formation of a substitutional solid solution. In fact, with \n\nSi in solid solution, its smaller atomic radius promoted the contraction of the TiN lattice and \n\nthe consequent shift of XRD peaks for higher angles. Residual stresses could not be the cause \n\nfor the peaks shift since they were compressive and similar in all the films (approximately 3 \n\nGPa). The formation of a substitutional solid solution was explained by the low deposition \n\ntemperature, together with a low substrate ion bombardment, condition that do not provide the \n\nnecessary mobility of the arriving species for Si-N phase segregation and consequent \n\nformation of a nanocomposite arrangement, i.e. nanocrystalline TiN grains embedded in a \n\nSi3N4 matrix. V incorporation in TiSiN films also made moving the peaks to higher angles, \n\nbehavior once again related to a smaller unit cell due to the replacement of Ti by the smaller \n\nV atoms. In these coatings the compressive residual stresses were also in the range of ~3 to ~4 \n\nGPa. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - XRD patterns of TiSiN coatings with Si content ranging from 0 to 12.6 at.% and S1-y coatings with \n\nV additions.  \n\n35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45\n\nS1-12 (12.0 at.%V)\n\nS1-8 (7.3 at.%V)\n\nS1-4 (1.1 at.%V)\n\nTiN (200)TiN (111)\n\nS2-0 (6.7 at.% Si)\n\nS3-0 (12.6 at.% Si)\n\nS1-0 (3.8 at.% Si)\n\nTiN\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\nv\ne\n I\nn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\n2 ?\n\n\n\nChapter V \u2013 Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering \n\n42 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nThe dependence of hardness and Young\u2019s Modulus on the Si and V contents is shown \n\nin Figure 5.2. With Si incorporation, the hardness of the coatings increased up to a maximum \n\nvalue of 27 GPa (6.7 at.% Si), trend attributed exclusively to a solid solution hardening \n\nmechanism since, as above referred, the level of compressive residual stresses was similar for \n\nall the films. A further increase in the silicon content led to a decrease in the hardness, in good \n\nagreement with the loss of crystallinity of this coating. The Young\u00b4s Modulus monotonously \n\ndecreased with Si incorporation, which is related to the progressive importance of Si-bonds in \n\nthe TiN lattice.  \n\nConcerning the effect of V additions, similar evolution was observed for all the Si \n\ncompositions (see Figure 5.2 b) for S1-y series). A slight increase in the hardness and \n\nYoung\u00b4s modulus was observed for lower V contents, followed by a drop for the highest one. \n\nSimilar explanation was suggested, the hardness enhancement was attributed to solid solution \n\nhardening since, again, the compressive residual stress values are very similar. The coatings \n\nwith the highest Si content displayed the lowest hardness and Young\u2019s modulus among all the \n\nV rich coatings, in good agreement with their low crystallinity. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - a) Effect of Si content on the hardness and Young\u2019s modulus for the TiN system. b) Effect of V \n\ncontent on the hardness and Young\u2019s modulus forcoating S1-0. \n\n \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\n48\n\n \n\na)\n\nH\na\nrd\n\nn\ne\ns\ns\n (\n\nG\nP\n\na\n)\n\nSi content (at.%)\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\n280\n\n300\n\n320\n\n340\n\n360\nY\n\no\nu\nn\ng\n's\n\n M\no\nd\nu\nlu\n\ns\n (\n\nG\nP\n\na\n)\n\n\n\nChapter V - Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering \n\n43 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 (continued). \n\nIn relation to the adhesion of coatings, only two failure modes were observed on the \n\nscratch track of the coatings; the first cracking and the first chipping.

Oxidation resistance and diffusion mechanisms \n\nThe effect of increasing Si and V content on the onset point of oxidation of TiSi(V)N \n\nsystems were studied in a TGA equipment. The films were annealed from room temperature \n\nup to 1200 \u00baC at a ramp temperature of 20 \u00baC/min. Si incorporation in TiN film strongly \n\nincreased the onset of oxidation, being S3-0 sample the most oxidation resistant. On the other \n\nhand, V addition to TiSiN decreased the onset point of oxidation down to a value close to 500 \n\n\u00baC, independently of the Si and V contents, value even lower than for TiN film.  \n\nIn order to better study the oxidation resistance of the coatings, isothermal annealing at \n\nselected temperatures and times were performed. TiN was annealed at 600 \u00baC during 30 min, \n\nS2-0 was heat treated at 900 \u00baC during 1h and finally S2-8 was annealed at three different \n\ntemperatures: 550 \u00baC during 1h, 600 \u00baC during 30 min and 700 \u00baC during 10 min.

Thus, the \n\nexcellent oxidation resistance of the TiSiN film was a result of the formation of a continuous \n\nprotective SiO2 layer in the interface film/oxide scale (for more detail see Annex H) that \n\nhindered the ions diffusion and, thus, protecting the coating from further oxidation. In the case \n\nof the V rich coating, the isothermal curves tested at 550 and 600 \u00baC showed two steps: at an \n\nearly stage, the weight gain increase over time is linear whilst, in the second stage, a parabolic \n\nevolution can be fitted. For higher temperatures (700 \u00baC) only the parabolic evolution was \n\nobserved but with a strong increase in the mass gain due to the melting of V-O phases.  \n\nThe structural analysis of the oxide scale when the oxidation temperatures are lower \n\nthan the melting point of ?-V2O5 showed that a two layer-oxide structure was formed, with a \n\nthick porous inner layer (SiO2 plus Ti(V)O2) and an outer discontinuous layer of ?-V2O5. To \n\nthe first linear step in the oxidation curves was suggested the growing of Ti(V)O2, as a \n\nconjugation of a fast rate of mass transport in the oxide with a slower surface step \n\naccompanying the gas dissociation, adsorption and subsequent entry of oxygen into the \n\nTi(V)O2 lattice. In fact, at the very beginning of the oxidation process, due to the high Ti \n\ncontent, a TiO2 layer started growing. The presence of V ions and its high solubility with Ti \n\npromoted the formation of Ti(V)O2 solid solution, which comprised vanadium cations with \n\nlower oxidation states, as V\n3+\n\n ions [119, 129]. The substitution of Ti\n4+\n\n by V\n3+\n\n ions in the TiO2 \n\nlattice would increase the concentration of interstitial metallic Ti\n4+\n\n ions and, simultaneously, \n\nwould decrease the number of excess electrons. The oxidation mechanism was inverted in \n\nrelation to Ti-N, being the outwards diffusion of metallic ions (Ti\n3+\n\n Ti\nn+\n\n) more favorable than \n\nthe inwards diffusion of O\n2- \n\nions. There were several consequences of this inversion: (i) the \n\noxidation rate increased substantially, (ii) the kinetics of the oxidation was not controlled any \n\nmore by a diffusion process but by the rate of dissociation, adsorption and combination at the \n\nsurface of O\n2-\n\n with metallic ions, and (iii) the continuous and compact Si-rich layer cannot be \n\nformed. ?-V2O5 and ?-V2O5 phase showed to be to be formed exclusively on the top of the \n\ninner layer due to the V ions reduction on the surface. The parabolic beahaviour after the first \n\nlinear increase in mass was explained by the oxide scale thickness increase, making harder the \n\nion transport. Then, from a threshold thickness on, the ionic diffusion is the controlling step of \n\noxidation, over the dissociation mechanism, giving rise to the parabolic behavior \n\ncharacteristic of ion diffusion controlled processes.  \n\n\n\nChapter V - Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering \n\n47 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nA detailed description of the oxidation mechanism occurring in TiSiN and TiSi(V)N \n\ncoatings oxidation can be found in Annex H. \n\n5.4. Tribological behavior \n\nThe tibological behavior of TiSi(V)N coatings at room temperature was assessed in a \n\npin on disc equipment using two different balls, alumina (Al2O3) and high speed steel (HSS). \n\nThe tests were performed with the same test conditions used for Ni-based coatings deposited \n\nby PTA. Coatings S2-4 and S2-8 were used to study the effect of V additions to the TiSiN \n\n(S2-0) and S3-8 film, which had a higher silicon and similar vanadium contents in relation to \n\nS2-8 coating, was used to understand the role of the Si on the films. Besides TiSiN (S2-0) \n\nfilm, the properties of the V-containing coatings were compared and discussed in relation to \n\nthe TiN and TiVN films. The TiVN coating had a hardness of 23.8 GPa, a Young\u2019s Modulus \n\nof 398 GPa, a similar level of residual stresses and slight higher adhesion critical load than \n\nany of the other coatings.  \n\nThe wear rate of the coatings tested at room temperature is shown in Figure 5.5. TiSiN \n\nwas the coating showing the highest wear rate. With increasing V content the wear rate \n\nprogressively dropped. Furthermore, for Al2O3 balls the wear rate was much lower than when \n\nthe coatings slided against HSS balls. These results were in good agreement with the lower \n\nfriction coefficient achieved when Al2O3 balls were used. The addition of V had the same \n\ninfluence for the TiN reference coating with a clear improvement of the tribological behavior. \n\nThe worst performance of TiSiN among all the tested coatings was attributed to its low \n\nfracture toughness. When TiN and TiSiN coatings were tested against Al2O3 balls, an abrasion \n\nwear mechanism was shown to occur on both wear tracks. However, due to the lower fracture \n\ntoughness of the TiSiN, deeper scratches and large loosely wear particles were formed in the \n\nwear track, leading to a strong abrasion of the surface and, thus, a higher wear rate.  \n\nThe decreased of the wear rate and the friction coefficient with vanadium \n\nincorporation was attributed to the formation of the V2O5 phase on the wear track of the \n\ncoatings. This oxide acted as a lubricious tribo-film, protecting the coating from wear, being \n\nthe protective effect as efficient as higher is the amount of V2O5 formed. In relation to S2-8 \n\nfilm, TiVN coating (both with similar V content) presented lower wear rate. Such behavior \n\nwas explained based on the effect of Si on the inhibition of V2O5 formation, resulting in \n\nhigher wear rate and friction coefficient.  \n\n\n\nChapter V \u2013 Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering \n\n48 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nWhen tested against HSS ball, the counterparts were covered with both as-deposited \n\nand oxidized material; however, in TiSiN coating higher amounts of big wear debris were \n\ndetected, resulting from the lower fracture toughness of this coating. Therefore, a higher \n\nabrasion of the surface was produced with consequent higher wear rate. For V-containing \n\ncoatings, the much higher wear rates and friction values measured with HSS in comparison to \n\nAl2O3 balls were attributed to a less V2O5 oxide formation on the worn surfaces.  \n\nA detailed characterization of the effect of V additions on the coatings wear and their \n\ncorrelation to the main wear mechanisms is shown in Annex I. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 - Wear rate of the coatings tested against Al2O3 and HSS balls. \n\nThe effect of V incorporation on the abrasion resistance of TiSiN coatings (series S2-y \n\nfilms) was also assessed using the same test conditions as for the Ni-based coatings evaluated \n\nin Annex A. However, in this case, lower sliding distances were selected due to a different \n\nwear mechanism and a much lower coating thickness. The volume loss of coatings plotted as \n\na function of the load times sliding distance parameter is presented in Figure 5.6; the \n\nrespective results for the specific wear rate are plotted in Figure 5.7. As for the other \n\ntribological tests, the addition of vanadium gave rise to lower specific wear rates. This trend \n\nwas more notorious for coatings with low V content. In all cases, the main wear mechanism, \n\nsuggested by the analysis of the wear scars produced by the ball was 3-body abrasion, which \n\nreproduced the wear observed on the surface of real molds after a period of service. In \n\ncomparison to pin-on-disc tests, the specific wear rate achieved with this abrasion test was \n\nhigher about two orders of magnitude. \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14 Wear track\n\n Al\n2\nO\n\n3\n ball\n\n HSS ball\n\nS3-8S2-8S2-4S2-0TiVNTiN\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-6\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\n\n\nChapter V - Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering \n\n49 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 - Evolution of the wear behavior as a function of the parameter \u201cnormal load \u00d7 sliding distance\u201d. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 - Specific wear rate of coatings, calculated from the slope of a straight line fitted to the points plotted \n\nin Figure 5.6. \n\nIn summary, although the nanocomposite structure was not formed in TiSi(V)N films, \n\nV additions significantly improve their mechanical and tribological properties; however, it has \n\na detrimental effect on their oxidation resistance due to the outwards V ions diffusion to the \n\nsurface impeding the formation of a continuous Si-O protective layer. The improvement of \n\nthe tribological properties with V incorporations was related to V2O5 formation on the sliding \n\ncontact that acted as a lubricious tribo-film, decreasing the friction and protecting the coating \n\nfrom wear. \n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n6.0\n\n7.0\n S2-0\n\n S2-4\n\n S2-8\n\n S2-12\n\nV\no\nlu\n\nm\ne\n l\no\ns\ns\n (\n\n1\n0\n\n-4\n m\n\nm\n3\n)\n\nLoad x Sliding distance (N.m)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nS2-12S2-8S2-4S2-0\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-4\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI - Conclusions and Future Research \n\n51 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter VI \n\n6. Conclusions and Future Research \n\nThe main aim of the research activity carried out in this thesis was the improvement of \n\nthe surface properties of molds used in glass containers production, through the application of \n\nseveral types of coatings. Two methodologies were assessed: i) the optimization of \n\nconventional Ni-based coatings currently applied on mold surfaces; ii) the development of \n\nnew coating systems deposited by emergent technologies. In the first part, the effect of base \n\nmaterial (cast iron) dilution, induced by the change in arc current, on the properties of Ni-\n\nbased coatings deposited by the PTA process was investigated, while in the second part two \n\ndifferent topics were explored. Firstly, the influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the \n\nproperties of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS process were studied while, in the \n\nsecond topic, the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N thin films, containing \n\ndifferent Si contents, deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering, was evaluated. The \n\ncoatings have markedly different morphological features, physical, mechanical, oxidation and \n\ntribology properties depending on the deposition technology and, thus, their direct \n\ncomparison becomes sometimes without sense. Nevertheless, although individual \n\ncomparisons were already drawn in each chapter, some common aspects among different \n\ncoatings deserve comparison, mainly those directly related with the potential industrial \n\napplicability, as it will be described below. \n\n\n\nChapter VI - Conclusions and Future Research \n\n52 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nThe dilution degree of the substrate promoted by changing the arc current affected all \n\nthe functional properties of the Ni-based alloy coatings. Their hardness, oxidation resistance \n\nand tribological behavior were strongly influenced by the micro-structure which consisted \n\ntypically in Ni-Fe fcc solid solution phase, with intendendritic phases rich in Cr-B, Ni-Si and \n\nFe-Mo-C. Although, the number of precipitates in the grain boundaries increased with the \n\ndilution, the hardness of the coatings was reduced due to the growing influence of the softer \n\nmaterial of the substrate. As a consequence, also the abrasion wear resistance, calculated from \n\ntests performed at room temperature with silica slurry, decreased with increasing substrate \n\ndilution. The same trend was observed in another tribological test (pin-on-disc), having been \n\nobserved specific wear rates varying as much as two up to three orders of magnitude. At high \n\ntemperature, dilution showed a beneficial effect on the wear resistance of coatings, behavior \n\nexplained by the decrease of the oxidation resistance due to the incorporation of base material \n\nelements. In fact, due to the lower oxidation resistance of the coatings produced with higher \n\ndilution, an easy and fast formation of a high amount of oxide debris on the worn surface \n\noccurred, which by agglomeration gave rise to a protective tribo-layer improving the wear \n\nresistance of the coating. The post-deposition heat treatment of the coatings induced a \n\nreduction of the hardness restricted to the partially melted and heat affected zones. In \n\nconclusion, the advantages and drawbacks associated with the degree of dilution indicate that \n\nto produce the best and most performing coating compromises should be found between the \n\nmechanical properties, level of oxidation and wear resistance of coatings. \n\nNanostructured ZrO2 additions to Ni-based alloy coatings had different impact when \n\nmechanically alloyed mixed powders (MA) or separated powders (Dual) were used. MA \n\npowders deposited coatings displayed a homogeneous and compact microstructure with small \n\nzirconia particles evenly distributed in the matrix; contrasting with a porous microstructure, \n\nfull of semi-melted Ni powders with large particles of ZrO2 entrapped in grain boundaries, \n\nresponsible for a brittle behavior. In both cases, addition of ZrO2 improved the hardness and \n\nwear behavior. The brittleness of the coatings was determinant on the wear resistance; \n\ntherefore, the wear rates increased when going from MA powders, through Dual powders up \n\nto pure ZrO2 coatings. All the APS coatings showed higher hardness values than the PTA \n\ndeposited Ni-based ones; however, their micro-abrasion resistance was worse, differing one \n\norder of magnitude, fact explained by the low cohesion between powders. In conclusion, for \n\nany possible application of ZrO2-containing coatings in the protection of glass molds, an \n\nadditional melting treatment will be required, in order to improve the cohesion and overcome \n\nthe brittleness problems. \n\n\n\nChapter VI - Conclusions and Future Research \n\n53 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nSi and V additions to TiN and TiSiN systems, respectively, did not change \n\nsignificantly either the global type of columnar morphology or the diffraction peaks indexed \n\nto a crystalline fcc TiN-type phase. A shift of the diffraction peaks to higher angles was \n\nalways observed with either Si or V additions, indicating the placement of those elements in \n\nsubstitutional solid solution in the TiN lattice. Therefore, the required nanocomposite \n\nstructure needed for the control of vanadium diffusion was not deposited. The presence of Si \n\nand V incorporation in solid solution in TiN gave rise to a slight increase in the hardness, \n\nalthough for the high contents an inverse trend was observed. In comparison to previous thick \n\ncoatings, much higher hardness values could be achieved with the thin films, as shown in \n\nFigure 6.1, which is an indication of a possible compensation of their lower thickness for \n\nglass molds protection. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 - Hardness of coatings studied in the aim of this thesis, deposited by different deposition techniques. \n\nSi and V had an antagonist behavior in relation to oxidation resistance and tribological \n\nbehavior. Moreover, contrarily to what could be expected, silicon which improved \n\nsignificantly the oxidation resistance of TiN system, had a deleterious influence on the wear \n\nresistance. On the other hand, vanadium that promoted an abrupt drop in the oxidation \n\nresistance of the TiSiN coatings presented an excellent tribological behavior. The low \n\noxidation resistance of TiSi(V)N films was attributed to the rapid V ions diffusion throughout \n\nthe oxide scale, which inhibited the formation of a continuous protective silicon oxide layer \n\nwhich, in case of TiSiN is the responsible for the high oxidation resistance.

Therefore, despite the observed decrease in oxidation resistance of films \n\ncontaining vanadium, this should not be regarded as a disadvantage from the tribological \n\npoint of view, as the V2O5 phase detected can act as a solid lubricant. Among all the studied \n\ncoatings, V-containing coatings displayed the worst oxidation resistance (see comparison in \n\nFigure 6.2). Although TiSiN coating was the most oxidation resistant coating, even in \n\ncomparison with the Ni-based coatings (specimens 1 and 3) well known for applications at \n\nhigh temperature, the addition of vanadium to TiSiN degraded completely its oxidation \n\nbehavior. At temperatures higher than the melting point of the V2O5 phase (~675 \u00baC), the \n\nintegrity of the V rich coatings is loss due to rapid oxidation. This can be a drawback for the \n\napplication of TiSi(V)N coatings in molds surface protection. Thus, further studies to control \n\nthe V diffusion and, consequently, to improve the oxidation resistance of the coatings, are \n\nrequired. The objective will be the deposition of these films with different structures, i.e. as a \n\nnanocomposite (TiVN grains embedded in a Si3N4 matrix) or as a multilayer structure (TiVN \n\nlayers alternating with Si3N4 layers). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 - Comparison of the oxidation weight gain of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA and TiSi(V)N ones \n\ndeposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. \n\nThe tribological experiments performed at room temperature, either by micro-scale \n\nabrasion or pin-on-disc testing revealed that V additions could improve the wear behavior of \n\nTiN and TiSiN films. A comparison of the specific wear rate of all the films calculated from \n\nthe tests achieved by both techniques using the same test conditions (see Figures 6.3 and 6.4) \n\nshowed that V-containing thin films performed much better than the thicker coatings. \n\n0 1200 2400 3600\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25 Specimen 1 900 \u00baC 2 h\nSpecimen 3 900 \u00baC 2 h\n\nS2-8 500 \u00baC 1 h\n\nS2-0 900 \u00baC 1 h\n\nTiN 600 \u00baC 30 min\n\nS2-8 600 \u00baC 30 min\n\nS2-8 700 \u00baC 10 min\n\nW\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \ng\na\nin\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/c\n\nm\n2\n)\n\nTime (s)\n\n\n\nChapter VI - Conclusions and Future Research \n\n55 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nPreliminary tribological tests performed by pin-on-disc of a TiSi(V)N film at high \n\ntemperature also revealed a better performance in relation to the thicker ones (Ni-based \n\ncoatings deposited by PTA). In fact, even for a testing temperature 50 \u00baC higher (see Figure \n\n6.5), TiSi(V)N film showed close to one or two orders of magnitude lower wear rates than Ni-\n\nbased coatings and uncoated gray cast iron, respectively.  \n\nIn conclusion, although further studies at high temperature are required to better \n\ncharacterize the tibological behavior of V rich coatings, the preliminary tests showed that \n\nTiSi(V)N films had potential for the protection of mold surfaces, despite their low thickness \n\nin comparison to thick coatings. Nevertheless, it should be remarked that pin-on-disc and \n\nmicro-scale abrasion apparatus did not reproduce well the loading conditions to which molds \n\nare submitted. Therefore the development of new tribology equipment is recommended for \n\nreproducing the real working conditions, i.e. tests should simulate abrasion at high \n\ntemperature. Only with such equipment it will be possible to have a proper prediction of the \n\ncoatings wear during service. \n\nFinally, several remarks should be considered in this comparison between thin and \n\nthick coatings. In a first glance, it could be thought that a higher coating thickness (typical of \n\nPTA and APS coatings) could compensate a lower wear resistance. However, in glass \n\ncontainers production, many times dimensional tolerances in the molds are just a few \n\nmicrons, values incompatible with a possible wear out of the total thickness of a thick coating, \n\nincreasing that way, the viability of thin films as a solution for molds protection. On the other \n\nhand, the use of thin films also allows overcome the poor thermal conductivity attributed to \n\nthe use of thick ceramic coatings. In fact, their lower thickness permits a much more efficient \n\ncooling of the coating and base material in spite of the base thermal conductivity of both types \n\nof coatings could be the same. Therefore, lower power consumption for molds cooling down \n\ncan be expected, thereby reducing production costs. Hence, for future work, thermal \n\nconductivity tests are recommended to compare the cooling rate of molds protected by thick \n\nand thin coatings. In relation to maintenance problems, the use of these self-lubricant coatings \n\ncan also remedy the drawbacks that normally liquid lubricant brings (corrosion and \n\ndisassembling problems), which frequently led to the molds failure and, therefore, to \n\nincreasing production costs. In fact solid lubricious oxides are not as reactive as liquid \n\nlubricants are and the global amount used is much lower. Thus, the probability of corrosion is \n\nmuch lower allowing more uniform, durable and efficient lubrication of the produced parts. \n\nFurthermore, the use of these coatings has a huge advantage from the environmental point of \n\nview, since they are not as harmful for the environment as the liquid ones are. In relation to \n\n\n\nChapter VI - Conclusions and Future Research \n\n56 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nthe production of the coatings, despite the high production costs of sputtered films, the \n\nreduction of the steps in molds production, such as final machining and polishing (see Table \n\n2.2 in chapter II) and the high number of components that can be coated at the same time, \n\nwhen compared to the technology used for the production of thicker ones, mitigate the costs \n\nof protection of the molds. With the expectancy of increasing lifetime, due to their superior \n\nmechanical and tribological properties, thin sputtered films should be considered in relation to \n\nthick coatings in the protection of molds for glass industry. Specifically, V rich coatings are \n\nof great relevance and promising for molds protection. Furthermore, its application could be \n\nextended to related areas where high temperature resistance and lubricious properties are \n\nrequired, such as the protection of machining tools for high-speed cutting and dry machining \n\nprocesses. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3- Specific wear rate of coatings calculated from the micro-scale abrasion tests. \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n PTA Coatings\n\n APS Coatings\n\n PVD Coatings\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-3\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\nS\npe\n\nci\nm\n\nen\n 4\n\nS\npe\n\nci\nm\n\nen\n 1 N\n\ni\n\nN\ni+\n\n20\n%\n\nZ\nrO\n\n2\n M\n\nA\n\nN\ni+\n\n40\n%\n\nZ\nrO\n\n2\n M\n\nA\n\nS\npe\n\nci\nm\n\nen\n 2\n\nS\n2-\n\n0 \n(T\n\niS\niN\n\n)\n\nS\n2-\n\n4 \n(T\n\niS\niV\n\nN\n)\n\nS\n2-\n\n8 \n(T\n\niS\niV\n\nN\n)\n\nS\n2-\n\n12\n (\nT\niS\n\niV\nN\n)\n\n\n\nChapter VI - Conclusions and Future Research \n\n57 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4 - Specific wear rate of coatings calculated from the pin-on-disc tests. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 - Specific wear rate of coatings calculated from the pin-on-disc tests performed at high temperature. \n\n \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n PTA Coatings\n\n PVD Coatings\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-6\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\nS\npe\n\nci\nm\n\nen\n 4\n\nS\npe\n\nci\nm\n\nen\n 1\n\nT\niN\n\nT\niV\n\nN\n\nC\nas\n\nt i\nro\n\nn\n\nS\n2-\n\n0 \n(T\n\niS\niN\n\n)\n\nS\n2-\n\n4 \n(T\n\niS\niV\n\nN\n)\n\nS\n2-\n\n8 \n(T\n\niS\niV\n\nN\n)\n\nS\n3-\n\n8 \n(T\n\niS\niV\n\nN\n)\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n175\n\n200\n\n225\n\n250\n\n275\n\n Tested at 550 \n0\nC\n\n Tested at 600 \n0\nC\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-6\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\nS\npe\n\nci\nm\n\nen\n 4\n\nS\npe\n\nci\nm\n\nen\n 1\n\nC\nas\n\nt i\nro\n\nn\n\nS\n2-\n\n8 \n(T\n\niS\niV\n\nN\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences \n\n59 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n7.

However the hardness and wear performance of these coatings are\nsignificantly affected by the procedure adopted during the deposition of coatings. The aim of the present\ninvestigation is to study the effect of arc current on the microstructure, hardness and wear performance of a\nnickel-based hardfacing alloy deposited on gray cast iron, currently used in molds for the glass industry.\nMicrostructure, hardness and wear assessments were used to characterize the coatings. Electron probe micro\nanalysis (EPMA) mapping, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDAX) and\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the microstructure of the deposits. The effect of post weld\nheat treatment (PWHT) on the microstructure and hardness was also studied.

Increasing the arc current reduces the proportion of porosity and hardness of the\ncoatings and modifies their composition due to the increasing dilution of the cast iron. The partial melted zone\n(PMZ) had a typical white cast iron plus martensite microstructure, while the heat affected zone (HAZ) had\nonly a martensite structure.

Introduction\n\nTraditionally, molds for the glass industry are manufactured from\ngray cast iron or copper alloys due to their superior thermal behavior,\nrelatively low cost and excellent thermal conductivity. This is\nassociated with high hardness and good wear resistance and leads\nto a high production rate of glass parts. However, the edges of the\nmolds made of these materials are sensitive to wear in heavy duty\ncycles; so they need to be coated with materials that are more\nresistant to high temperature and wear [1].\n\nThe coating of these edges is frequently done by plasma transferred\narc (PTA), using nickel-based filler metals [2]. Normally the PTA process\nproduces very high quality, thicker deposits, offering optimal protection\nwith minimal thermal distortion of the parts, low environmental impact\nand high deposition rates in single layer deposits [3]. It allows perfectly\ncontrolled deposition of alloys on mechanical parts that are subject to\nharsh environments, significantly extending their service life [4]. The\ncomposition and properties of the coating are greatly influenced by the\ntype and dilution of the substrate. Balasubramanian et al. [5] suggest\nthat the dilution of coatings should be controlled through the relevant\nprocess parameters (transferred arc current, travel speed, powder feed\nrate, torch oscillation frequency and stand-off distance). Takano et al. [6]\nstudied the influence of arc current variation, arc constriction and\nplasma gas flow on the characteristics of Co coatings. They concluded\nthat current intensity is the parameter that most significantly affects the\ncharacteristics of the deposits as higher currents increase the dilution of\nthe base material and decrease the hardness of the coatings. D\u00edaz et al.\n[7] mentioned that the dilution also increases with gas plasma flow in\nstellite 6 coatings.\n\nNickel-based hardfacing alloys have become increasingly popular\nin recent years owing to their excellent performance in environments\nwhere abrasion, corrosion and elevated temperature are factors. The\nmicrostructure of Ni-based hardfacing alloy deposits has been studied\nusing various alloy compositions and different substrates [8\u201310].\nHowever, most of the studies consider the deposition of nickel alloys\non stainless steels; there are no references to characterization of such\ndeposits applied to gray cast iron.\n\nGurumoorthy et al. [8], who worked with nickel-base superalloys\ndeposited by PTA on stainless steel, reported that the microstructure of\nthe deposit consists of ?-Ni solid solution dendrites, carbides, and\ninterdendritic eutectics composed of ?-Ni and other phases identified as\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfcoat.2011.03.008\nmailto:filipe.fernandes@dem.uc.pt\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfcoat.2011.03.008\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/02578972\n\n\nTable 2\nDeposition parameters for PTA weld surfacing.\n\nSpecimen\n1\n\nSpecimens 2 and 3* Specimen\n4\n\nMain arc current (A) 100 128 140\nPowder feed rate (rpm) 20 20 20\nTravel speed (mm/s) 2 2 2\nPowder feed gas flow rate (l/min) 2 2 2\nPlasma gas flow rate (l/min) 2.2 2.2 2.2\nShielding gas flow rate (l/min) 20 20 20\nTorch work distance (mm) 13 13 13\nOscillation (mm) 4 4 4\nPreheat temperature \u00b0C 480\u2013500 480\u2013500 480\u2013500\n\n*See text.\n\n4095F.

The microstructure and mechanical properties of\nNi base alloys are greatly influenced by the alloying elements. For\nexample aluminum, titanium and niobium are added to strengthen the\nmaterial through the formation of ?? gamma prime (Ni3(Al,Ti)) and\nboron and zirconium are added to improve the creep strength and\nductility [9,10].\n\nThis paper details an investigation of the microstructure, hardness and\n3-body abrasion behavior of a nickel-based hardfacing alloy deposited by\nPTA on gray cast iron with different weld currents. Microstructural\nchanges in the HAZ as well as the effect of the post weld heat treatment on\nthe microstructure and hardness of the coatings are also examined.\n\n2. Experimental procedure\n\nThecoatings were deposited byPTAtechnology (usinga Commersald\nGroup ROBO 90 machine) on flat surfaces of gray cast iron blocks using a\nnickel-based hardfacing alloy. This technique obtains thicker coatings\nwith lower porosity and higher production rate than the Flame Spraying\nand Gas Tungsten Arc Welding processes. The composition of base and\ndeposit materials is given in Table 1. The same process parameters were\nused for each deposition with theexception of the arc current, whichwas\n100 A for specimen 1, 128 A for specimen 2 and 140 A for specimen 4.\nThe edges of a mold made of the same material but with a machined U-\nshaped groove were coated with the same alloy using the parameters of\nspecimen 2. This specimen is referred to as specimen 3. The surfacing\nparameters used in the tests are listed in Table 2. The blocks of base\nmaterial were induction heated before coating, in order to reduce\nthermal shock, thus reducing the tendency to crack. After coating, the\nblocks were left to cool to room temperature in still air. Samples\ncontaining coating and base material were removed from each block and\nthe mold for further analysis.\n\nThe samples for microstructural analysis were polished and etched\nfollowing conventional procedures. Etchingwas performed usingequal\nparts of nitric acid and glacial acetic acid, to reveal the microstructure of\nthe deposits. Marble's solution (HCl (50 ml)+CuSO4 (10 g)+H20\n(50 ml)) was used to reveal the microstructure of the cast iron. The\nmicrostructure of the different regions of the samples was characterized\nby optical microscopy (OP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The\nchemical composition was evaluated by Electron Probe Microanalysis\n(EPMA). The hardness profile across the interface of the coatings was\ndetermined with Vickers testing using a 5 N load at 15 s.\n\nSome specimens were subjected to a subsequent heat-treatment\nat 850 \u00b0C for 1 h and then cooled in the furnace to room temperature,\nin order to reduce brittle phases present in the partially melted and\nheat affected zones. Microstructural and hardness profiles of these\nspecimens were obtained.\n\nWear tests on the coated surfaces were carried out at room\ntemperature in ball-cratering devices. In these devices, a ball is placed\non a flat specimen in the presence of abrasive slurry and rotated while\nbeing submitted to a specific load in order to produce a spherical cup-\nshaped depression. This process was used in order to reproduce the\nwear mechanism present at the surface of the coatings on glass molds\nwhich have been in service for a long time. An AISI 52100 steel ball\nbearing 25.4 mm in diameter was used at constant rotational speed of\n75 rpm.

The slurry used was prepared with a proportion of\n28 vol.% of silica in water.\n\nThe duration of the test, measured by the number of rotations, was\nselected according to the material and the test conditions employed.\nThe normal load used was 0.1 N.\n\nPhotographs of the spherical depressions were taken in order to\nmeasure their dimensions. The wear volume was calculated by Eq (1),\nwhere R is the ball radius and b is the crater chordal diameter.\n\nV = ? \u00d7 b4\n? ?\n\n= 64 \u00d7 R\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01\u00de\n\nArchard's model, given by Eq (2), is the one most commonly applied\nto wear results to determine a parameter to quantify the wear behavior\nof materials. In this equation P is the normal load, l is the sliding distance\nand k is the specific wear rate. The specific wear rate is the parameter\nwhich quantifies the wear behavior.\n\nV = k \u00d7 P \u00d7 l \u00f02\u00de\n\nTo quantify the specific wear rate a linear version of Archard's\nmodel was applied and statistical analysis was used to estimate the\nerror of measurement [11].\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\n3.1. Microstructure\n\nFour distinct regions were observed in the cross section of each of the\ncoatings deposited with the differentwelding conditions, asillustrated in\nFig. 1 A) for sample 3. Those regions are the fusion zone (FZ), composed\nof the Ni-alloy and the base material melted during the process, the\npartially melted zone (PMZ), which is the area immediately outside the\nFZ where liquation can occur during welding, the heat-affected zone\n(HAZ), which was not melted but underwent microstructural changes\nand the base material (BM), whose microstructure remains unaffected\nduring the coating deposition thermal cycle. The same regions were\nobserved by M.

Aspect of the coatings of: A) specimen 1, B) specimen\nboth measured from the cross section of the coating using Photoshop\nimage analysis. These images show that as the current is increased in\nthe range 100\u2013140 A, the dilution steadily increases from 28% to 59%.\nSpecimen 3 in the image illustrates the groove shape usually machined\nin the mold before coating. Comparing specimens 2 and 3, which were\nboth coated using the same current, it is possible to see that the groove\nproduces only a small change in the dilution and the results obtained\nfrom the flat blocks can be extrapolated to molds.\n\nThe dilution of cast iron modifies the composition of the coatings,\nas illustrated in Table 3, which shows the chemical composition\nmeasured by EPMA at various points of the coating and the substrate\nof specimen 3. Point 1 is located close to the coating surface, point 2 at\nthe mid-thickness of the coating, point 3 in the coating close to the\ninterface and the other two points are in the bulk cast iron; point 4\nclose to the interface and point 5 distant from it. The amount of iron in\nthe coating (N16%) is much higher than that provided by the\nhardfacing alloy (1.08%), producing a consequent reduction in the\nnickel content. According to Ezugwu et al. [9] the increase in iron\ncontent in the coatings tends to decrease their oxidation resistance\nbecause of the formation of a less adherent oxide scale. The increase in\nMo content in the coating is also caused by the dilution of the cast iron\nbecause it is absent in the hardfacing alloy. Although the true carbon\ncontent value could be skewed by contamination, carbon is present in\nthe coating in large quantities, again due to the contribution of the\ngraphite from the cast iron. Thus, increasing the arc current will\nincrease the dilution and the chemical composition of the coating will\nchange accordingly.\n\nAll coatings contained small random pores throughout the cross\nsection, as shown in Fig. 3. According to F. A. L. Dullien [13], the\n\u201cvolumetric\u201d and \u201carea\u201d porosity proportions are equivalent for random-\nstructured porous media, which agrees with our results.

Optical micrograph of: A) specimen 1, B) specimen 2, C) specimen 4, and D) interface specimen 1.\n\n4098 F.

This decrease in\nthe proportion of micropores in the coatings as current increases can be\ncorrelated with the refinement of the dendritic microstructure mentioned\nbelow. The decrease in dendrite size reduces the amount of liquid metal\ntrapped by dendrites during solidification, reducing the number of voids\nin the microstructure. Charmeux el al [14] mentioned this mechanism in\nthe solidification of Al micro castings. On the other hand the cast iron also\nexhibits significant porosity, with pores reaching 17 ?m in diameter, as\nillustrated in Fig. 3 D).\n\nThe typical microstructure of the coatings is shown in Fig. 4. The\nmicrostructures consist of dendrites of the Ni\u2013Fe solid solution phase,\nwith columnar morphology oriented along the direction of heat flow\nand torturous grain boundaries. The microstructure contains C flakes\n(dark floret-like structures) equally distributed through the micro-\nstructure. The chemical composition of the Ni-based powder (low\ncarbon content see Table 1) does not explain the large number of\nthese flakes which can only be attributed to the dilution of cast iron\ninduced by the PTA process. Furthermore, small interdendritic\nprecipitates can also be detected. These are possibly carbides, as\nexplained below. Fig. 4 A\u2013C) shows that an increase in the arc current\nand, therefore, an increase in dilution, allows carbides and C-flakes in\nthe microstructure to be more easily detected and observed. It was\nthought that there could be some coarsening of the microstructure as\nthe current was increased due to greater heat input. However this was\nnot observed. Fig. 4 shows that the dendritic structure becomes finer\nas the current increases. For example, the average ternary dendrite\nspacing for the specimens 1 and 4 is 15.4 and 11.2 ?m, respectively. As\nexplained below, this refinement can be related to the change in the\ncomposition of the deposited material due to its increasing dilution as\nthe arc current increases.\n\nThe phenomenon of circular \u201cislands\u201d, which frequently occur close to\nthe interface of the coating, is common to all the specimens (see Fig. 4 D)\nfor specimen 1), These islands are characterized by the total absence of\ngraphite. According to the Commersald company [15] they are caused\nwhen powder grains not melted by the plasma arc subsequently melt in\ncontact with the pool. Near the interface a cellular microstructure finer\nthanthedendritic structure was observed for all thesamples, as illustrated\nin Fig. 4 D) for specimen 1, where the grain size is approximately 12 ?m.\nThis refinement may be due to the higher solidification rates involved in\nthe boundary because of the efficient thermal exchange ensured by the\nhigh volume ratio substrate/coating of the base material, as suggested by\nGatto et al. [3].\n\nSEM analysis gives a more detailed view of the microstructure of the\ncoatings. Fig. 5 shows a SEM image of the microstructure of the coating\nof specimen 1. The image shows that in addition to the dendrites of the\nNi Fe solid solution phase and graphite flakes the grain boundary is\nformed of two phases: a light gray phase (like-grain) and a dark gray\none. EDAX spectra showed that the light gray phase and the dark gray\nphase are rich in silicon and chromium, respectively.\n\nA detailed analysis was carried out to study the main constituents of\nthe coatings using EPMA. WDS (wavelength dispersion spectroscopy)\n\nimage of Fig.?4\n\n\nFig. 5. A) Typical SEM micrograph (etched) revealing the grain boundaries of specimen 1; SEM EDAX spectra of: B) dark gray phase, and C) light gray phase.\n\n4099F. Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 205 (2011) 4094\u20134106\nmaps of the most abundant elements of the coating for all the specimens\nwere obtained. Fig. 6 A) represents a SEM image of the microstructure of\nthe deposit for the specimen 1. The respective elemental maps of Fe, Ni,\nSi, Cr, Al, B, C and Mo are shown in Fig. 6 B\u2013I), color-coded such that the\nlowest concentration of the element analyzed is indicated in purple and\nthe highest in red. The results of the WDS maps for specimen 1 reveal\nthat the dendrites are rich in iron, silicon and aluminum, while\nboundaries are rich in boron, silicon and chromium. Nickel is distributed\nalmost uniformly throughout the structure, except in areas where\ngraphite flakes are present. In the boundary chromium appears, to\nexclude siliconas these elements do not overlap. However, chromium\nand boron do overlap in the boundaries, as illustrated in Fig. 6 E) and H).\nThus, it can be concluded that the borders of the boundary are rich in Si\nwhereas the middles of theboundaries are mainly composed of B and Cr.\nComparing the information from Figs. 5 and 6 it is possible to conclude\nthat the light gray (like-grain) phase is rich in silicon and the dark gray\nphase is rich in chromium, which agrees with the EDAX analysis. Carbon\nconcentrates chiefly in the graphite flakes, as shown in Fig. 6 F), though\natsome particular points theincrementin theC signalwasalsoobserved\nin the boundary, mainly coinciding with the B signal (see circled zone in\nB and C maps) suggesting that carbides may have precipitated. Although\nnot visible in the C-map, very small agglomerates of Mo can be detected\nin Fig. 6 alsosuggesting formationof carbides. However, asshown below\nby XRD analysis, these carbides were not identified, probably due to\ntheir small size and/or content.\n\nTheincreaseinthe arc currentand, consequently, inthedilutionof cast\niron brought some changes in the distribution of the main elements in the\nmicrostructure, as shown by the WDS maps for specimen 4, illustrated in\nFig. 7. For this specimen, in comparison to sample 1, the main difference is\nrelated to the Ni and Fe signals. It is clear from Fig. 7 that the zones in the\n\nimage of Fig.?5\n\n\nFig. 6. WDS maps of the coating of specimen 1: (A) SEM image of the microstructure of the deposit, (B) iron, (C) nickel, (D) silicon, (E) chromium, (F) carbon, (G) aluminum, (H)\nboron, and (I) molybdenum.\n\n4100 F. Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 205 (2011) 4094\u20134106\ninterdendritic boundaries richer in iron are depleted in nickel and silicon\nbut that in the boundary these zones overlap with Cr and B. The grouping\nof these maps suggests the presence of a Fe\u2013Cr\u2013B phase in the boundaries,\nhowever, as can be seen later from the XRD analysis this is not identified,\nas only a preferential association with the B\u2013Cr phase is indicated, leading\nfree iron to combine with other elements. The Si rich zones, see Fig. 7 D),\nare depleted of Fe and rich in Ni. In specimen 4, as well as the strong signal\ngiven by the C flakes tiny molybdenum and carbon traces could be\ndetected in the surrounding material (where C is hardly present), which is\na clear contrast with the results from specimen 1. These elements are\ndistributed preferentially in the boundaries overlapping the Fe map,\nsuggesting the formation of a mixed carbide containing Fe and Mo. The\nincrease in the content of these elements is caused by the increased\ndilution, since they are present only in the cast iron. Collins and Lippold\n[16] and Ramirez et al. [17] mention that the presence of precipitates in\nthe interdendritic regions results in the formation of very tortuous grain\nboundaries and the excess of theses precipitates stops the migration of the\ngrain boundaries. This can justify the lower grain size of the coating\ndeposited with 140 A in spite of the higher energy supplied to the coating\nprocess. The literature also indicates that an increase in the molybdenum\nand carbon content improves the rate of heterogeneous transformation\nduring solidification. These elements normally segregate in the grain\nboundaries, thereby hindering grain growth [18]. Nevertheless, the\ninfluence of the much higher number and content of graphite flakes\npresented in the 140 A sample, these being segregated from the grain\nboundaries during material solidification, should therefore also be\n\nimage of Fig.?6\n\n\nFig. 7. WDS maps of the coating of specimen 4: (A) SEM image of the microstructure of the deposit, (B) iron, (C) nickel, (D) silicon, (E) chromium, (F) carbon, (G) boron, and (H)\nmolybdenum.\n\n4101F. Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 205 (2011) 4094\u20134106\nconsidered as an explanation for the lower grain size in this sample. As can\nbe seen in Fig. 4, C flakes are common in the grain boundaries.\n\nThe distribution of the chemical elements in the microstructure in\nspecimens 2 and 3 follows the trend mentioned above.\n\nFig. 8 shows the XRD spectra of specimens 1, 2 and 4. The analysis\nof this data revealed that the major phase present in the coatings is a\n(Ni, Fe) solid solution face centered cubic (ICDD card 47\u20131405-(111),\n(200), (220), (311), and (222) peaks at 2?~51.1\u00b0, 59.8\u00b0, 89.6\u00b0, 111.42\u00b0\nand 119.3\u00b0, respectively). WDS maps show that in Cr and B rich zones,\nSi does not exist as it is connected to Ni. The overlapping of Ni and Si\nsignals in WDS maps suggests the presence of a Ni\u2013Si phase, such as\nNi3Si (ICDD card 32\u20130699) shown in Fig. 8, corresponding to some of\nthe lower intensity experimental XRD peaks. The other peaks can be\nadjusted either to a Cr-boride phase Cr5B3 (ICDD card 32\u20130278) or to\nthe Fe, Mo mixed carbide of M6C (Fe3Mo3C \u2014 ICDD 47\u20131191) type.\nThe increasing content of this latter phase through samples 1 to 4 sits\nwell with the WDS maps presented and interpreted above. Further-\nmore, the indexation is in agreement with the results from the\nliterature where similar phases were also detected in a nickel alloy\ndeposit on an austenitic stainless steel [8]. In summary, the increase in\nthe arc current increased the dilution of the cast iron, raising the iron,\ncarbon and molybdenum content in the coating, promoting dendrite\nrefinement of the microstructure due to the increase in precipitates\n(Fe\u2013Mo\u2013C) and C flakes in the grain boundaries.\n\nimage of Fig.?7\n\n\nFig. 8.

Partially melted zone (PMZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ)\nThese zones are critical in cast irons since the material can solidify\n\nas white iron if cooling is rapid enough. If the amount of graphite\ndissolved during welding is high enough it is likely that it will also\ngive rise to a continuous carbide network. This is undesirable as a\nbrittle carbide matrix can cause durability problems in the final part.\nFig. 9 shows the microstructure of this zone in specimen 3. In this\nimage, cementite (Fe3C \u2014 white phase) can be seen concentrated near\nthe interface. Fig. 9 B) shows the microstructure of the PMZ zone\nunder high magnification. The image displays a large amount of\ncementite in the grain boundaries with acicular martensite inside the\ngrains. Some precipitates, identified as mixed titanium and molybde-\nnium carbides (marked respectively with the numbers 1 and 2 in\nFig. 9 and identified in Fig. 10, were also found. As these phases are\nhard and brittle this region is sensitive to in-service crack initiation\nand propagation due to thermal and mechanical fatigue, as discussed\nbelow. M. Pouranvari [12] also reported that a continuous brittle\nnetwork of coarse carbides along the weld fusion line may lead to\ninitiation of cracking.\n\nIn the heat affected zone, carbon can diffuse into the austenite\nduring welding and the austenite may subsequently transform into\nbrittle martensite due to the high cooling rate. Martensite is also\nFig. 9. SEM image of partial melted zone and heat affected zone of specimen 3, (A\nsusceptible to cracking. The amount of martensite formed depends on\nthe composition of the cast iron and the thermal history of the zone.\n\n3.2. Hardness\n\nFig. 11 shows the hardness profiles across the interface for all the\nstudied specimens. The vertical line in the graph represents the fusion\nline. The hardness through the melted material is approximately\nconstant and tends to decrease with increasing weld current. This can\nbe related to the higher dilution induced by the process.\n\nFor all the samples, the highest hardness values were measured in the\narea near the fusion line. A maximum hardness of 538 HV was observed\nin specimen 1 and decreases with increasing arc current for the other\nspecimens. As previously documented, the microstructure in that region\nconsisted of hard martensite and cementite. The proportionof martensite\nin the microstructure decreases with increasing distance from the fusion\nline and, thus, the hardness decreases too. The microstructure in the HAZ\nis directly related to the heat input in the process and therefore to the\ncurrent intensity used.\n\nThe high hardness values found in the PMZ and HAZ make these\nregions potentially responsible for many of the mechanical problems\nexperienced in welds in cast iron. The most effective way to reduce\n) transition between coating and the substrate, and (B) magnification of PMZ.\n\nimage of Fig.?8\nimage of Fig.?9\n\n\nFig. 10.

This can be done\nby controlling the heat input and preheating during coating. Another\nway to reduce the hardness in these zones is to submit the parts to an\nannealing treatment, although this solution is expensive.\n\nThe precipitates, the porosity and the random distribution of graphite\nflakes in the cast iron matrix can be linked to the variability of hardness in\nthe base material.\nFig. 14. Evolution of the wear behavior as a function of the parameter \u201cnormal\nload\u00d7sliding distance\u201d.\n3.3. Effect of post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) on the microstructure\nand hardness\n\nAlthough the heat treatment did not induce significant changes in\nthe microstructure and hardness of the coatings, it induced substan-\ntial changes in the PMZ and HAZ, as illustrated by the hardness\nprofiles before and after PWHT shown in Fig. 12 for specimen 4. This\nspecimen was produced with the highest arc current, and had the\nlowest hardness values in the PMZ, as shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 12 shows\nthat even in this case the heat treatment (holding at 850 \u00b0C for 1 h)\nproduced little change in the coating but a substantial decrease in the\nhardness of the PMZ and HAZ of the specimen. Similar behavior was\nobserved for the other specimens. This reduction in hardness can be\nattributed to the reduction in the proportion of hard phases,\ncementite and martensite, in these zones. After PWHT the base\nmaterial displays basically a perlitic/ferritic structure.\nFig. 13. Indentations in base material (specimen 4) after PWHT. A) indentation made in\nthe perlitic structure, and B) indentation made in the ferritic structure.\nAfter heat treatment a large scatter of hardness measurements\ncontinues to be observed in the cast iron. This scatter can be attributed\nto local alterations in the microstructure, as shown in Fig. 13, which\nrepresents the aspect of the indentations marked with the numbers 1\nand 2 in the hardness profile in Fig. 12. The image reveals that if the\nindentation impacts mainly the perlitic structure, the white zone in\nFig. 13 A), the hardness will be greater than if the indentation is\nperformed in the ferritic structure, the gray zone in Fig. 13 B). In\nconclusion, PWHT is beneficial because it reduces hardness in the PMZ\nand HAZ, without producing significant alterations in the melted zone.\n3.4. Wear test\n\nThe wear tests were performed to predict the effect of the different\nprocess parameters on the in-service wear behavior of the coated\ncomponents. The ball-cratering test results are shown in Fig. 14, as the\nvolume of material loss plotted against the product of sliding distance\n(l) and normal load (P). A complete reliability analysis is summarized\nin Table 4. The wear volume displays linear evolution with P\u00d7l, and\nthe slope corresponds to the specific wear rate. Specimen 1 exhibits\nboth the lowest wear volumes and the lowest specific wear rate,\ntherefore, it is the most resistant to wear. This is compatible with the\ngreatest hardness displayed by the coating of this specimen, as\nillustrated in Fig. 11. Samples 2 and 4 display very similar wear\nvolumes, which is confirmed by similar hardness values; even so,\nsample 2 has a specific wear rate slightly higher than sample 4.\n\nFig. 15 A) shows a SEM micrograph of a wear scar induced by the\nball-cratering device and Fig. 15 B) the surface of a coating of a mold\nafter a long time in service, which allows pitting to be identified as the\nmajor failure mechanism. The image also shows some cracks that can\nbe attributed to the localized melting of hard, brittle phases.\nTable 4\nResults of the linearization analysis.\n\nSpecific wear rate,\nk (mm3/N m)\n\nAverage STD Confidence\ninterval 90%\n\nr2\n\nSpecimen 1 6.9\u00d710?4 5.2\u00d710?5 5.7\u00d710?4 to 8.0\u00d710?4 0.977\nSpecimen 2 9.6\u00d710?4 6.6\u00d710?5 8.2\u00d710?4 to 1.1\u00d710?3 0.982\nSpecimen 4 8.0\u00d710?4 4.6\u00d710?5 7.0\u00d710?4 to 9.0\u00d710?4 0.987\n\nimage of Fig.?13\nimage of Fig.?14\n\n\nFig. 16.

Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 205 (2011) 4094\u20134106\nBall cratering is a micro-abrasion technique in which test\nconditions can be tailored to adjust the wear mechanism to grooving,\nwhich is plastic deformation controlled, or rolling, which is a fracture\ncontrolled process [19]. Prior tests were used to select test parameters\ncompatible with rolling wear, designed to induce pitting failure.\n\nThe wear scar displays two modes of wear: pitting and grooving,\npitting being the more extensive. Grooving occurs when particles slip\nonto the surface. Fig. 16 shows the morphology of these two wear\nmodes in higher magnification. The wear mechanism present in the\nspherical cup depressions (essentially 3-body rolling wear) accurately\nrepresents the wear mechanism in the molds. However one should\nkeep in mind that the molds in service are subject to other damage\nmechanisms such as thermal and mechanical fatigue and corrosion at\nhigh temperature.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nThe influence of the arc current used in the plasma transferred arc\nprocess (PTA), as well as the effect of post-weld heat treatment, on the\nmicrostructure, hardness and wear resistance of deposited layers was\nanalyzed in this study. The increase in the arc current increased the\ndilution of the cast iron, changing the composition and microstructure\nof the coatings. Moreover, the increase in current raises the quantity\nof precipitates and C flakes at the grain boundaries, which leads to the\nrefinement of the microstructure. Increasing the arc current gives rise\nto a reduction in the hardness in all regions of the coatings. The\nreduction in the hardness of the coatings is accompanied by a\nreduction in their wear resistance in wear tests performed at room\ntemperature with silica slurry. Post-weld heat treatment reduces the\nhardness in the partially melted zone and heat affected zone as\nopposed to the coatings themselves, where hardness remains\nunaffected.\n\nIn the future, abrasion and oxidation tests at high temperature will\nbe done, in order to reproduce the conditions of industry application.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors wish to express their sincere thanks to the company\nIntermolde, to Instituto Pedro Nunes (IPN) and the Portuguese\nFoundation for the Science and Technology (FCT) through COMPETE\nprogram from QREN and to FEDER for financial support.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] M.

The oxidation behavior of coatings held at\n800 and 900 \u00b0C for 2 h in air was studied by thermogravimetry (TGA). The surface, as well as the cross?section,\nof the coatings was characterized by scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spec-\ntroscopy (SEM/EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). TGA results indicate that the coating produced with lower arc\ncurrent exhibits more effective oxidation resistance than that produced with higher current. This behavior could\nbe correlated with the dilution promoted by the PTA process, which changes the chemical composition of coat-\nings. As a consequence, different kinds of oxide scales were detected in each coating after isothermal oxidation. In\nthe specimen produced with a lower arc current and lower dilution a protective layer of Si\u2013O is formed, while in\nthe specimen produced with a higher current two layers could be identified: an external one of Fe2O3, with small\nfeatures of Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 spinel rich phases, and an internal one of Fe3O4 with small amount of a dark phase\nevenly distributed rich in silicon, nickel and iron. The isothermal oxidation curve at 900 \u00b0C of the coating with\nhigher dilution showed two stages: at an early stage, the weight increase over time is almost linear whereas,\nin a second stage, a parabolic law could be fitted to the experimental data. The other specimens followed only\na parabolic law.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nCast irons and copper-alloys are commonly used in the production of\nglass molds and accessories for the glass industry [1]. In service, molds are\nsubjected to very severe abrasion, wear, oxidation, and fatigue at high\ntemperatures, due to contact with melted glass, which limit their surface\nlife. As a rule, automated manufacturing processes are operated with\nmold temperatures close to the critical temperature of the mold material.\nAlthough the temperature of melted glass is about 1050 \u00b0C the surface\ntemperature of molds is currently in the range of 500\u2013900 \u00b0C, due to an\ninternal cooling system in the molds. Above a critical temperature the\nglass body starts to adhere to the mold surface. Higher temperatures\nlead to mold failure. Therefore, protective coatings are normally applied\nto give the molds high temperature resistance, with the aim of increasing\ntheir lifetime in harsh environments [2,3].\n\nNickel-based superalloys gain an extremely important role in protec-\ntion of surfaces in components for the glass industry due to their excel-\nlent performance under conditions of abrasion and corrosion at elevated\ntemperatures [4\u20136]. Several processes have been used to apply coatings\nto protect the surfaces of these components, as follows: (i) thermal\nspraying processes such as high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF), atmospheric\nplasma spraying (APS) and flame spraying (FS); and (ii) hardfacing pro-\ncesses such as plasma transferred arc (PTA) and gas tungsten arc\n: +351 239 790 701.\nndes).\n\nrights reserved.\nwelding (GTAW) processes. However, since hardfacing processes give\nrise to a metallurgical bonding with the substrate they have been used\npreferentially in the protection of mold surfaces as opposed to thermal\nspraying processes which produce only mechanical bonding of the\nlayer to the substrate. Among the hardfacing processes above, PTA has\nbeen widely used to protect the surface of molds, especially their\nedges, because they are submitted to heavy wear duty cycles. This pro-\ncess gives rise to thicker deposits of very high quality, providing a high\ndeposition rate in a single layer [7\u20139]. However, the chemical composi-\ntion and properties of the coatings, as well their quality, are strongly\ninfluenced by the dilution of the substrate promoted by the PTA process.\nLow dilution provides coatings with a chemical composition similar to\nthe added metal powder, which is a prerequisite to getting improved\nwear and oxidation resistance [10]. However, as dilution is decreased\nby reducing process current the occurrence of defects such as lack of fu-\nsion increases, which is catastrophic in terms of the behavior of molds in\nservice. So during coating deposition, the tendency is to increase the di-\nlution of the base material even if oxidation resistance can be under-\nmined. As oxidation is one of the major failure factors at high\ntemperature in molds for the glass industry, it is imperative to under-\nstand how the different coatings provided by different process condi-\ntions behave under the harsh and oxidizing atmospheres.\n\nTechnical literature reports a lot of studies on the high temperature\noxidation behavior of nickel alloys. Liu et al. [11], who studied the oxi-\ndation behavior in air of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy at 900 and\n1000 \u00b0C, reported two oxidation steps for both temperatures. The first\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.06.070\nmailto:filipe.fernandes@dem.uc.pt\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.06.070\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/02578972\n\n\nTable 1\nNominal chemical composition (wt.%) of substrate and nickel alloy.\n\nBase material C Mn Si P S Cr Ni Mo V Ti Fe\n\nGray cast iron 3.60 0.60 2.00 b0.20 b0.04 b0.20 b0.50 0.50 0.10 0.20 Balance\n\nHardfacing C Cr Si B Fe Al F Co Ni\n\nNi-alloy 0.14 2.45 2.56 0.86 1.08 1.30 0.01 0.08 Balance\n\n197F.

Li\net al. [12] studied the oxidation of a NiCrAlYSi overlayer with or without\na diffusion barrier deposited by one-step arc ion plating. They showed\nthat the duplex coating system exhibits a more effective protection for\nthe substrate, where thin and continuous scales are adhered to the\noverlayer surface, and very limited oxidation and interdiffusion attacks\nare detected. Zhou et al. [13] studied the oxidation behavior of pure and\ndoped nickel alloys with different Co contents in air at 960 \u00b0C. They ob-\nserved that increasing the Co content increases the mass oxidation gain\nof the coatings.\n\nSince oxidation is one of the main drawbacks that limit the life of\nglass molds, the aim of this research is to study the effect of PTA current\nvariation on the oxidation behavior of coatings deposited on gray cast\niron using a nickel-based alloy. The oxidation behavior of the coatings\nwas studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The surface and\ncross?section morphologies of coatings after isothermal oxidation were\nobserved and characterized by scanning electron microscopy provided\nwith energy dispersion spectrometry (SEM-EDS) and x-ray diffraction.\nFurther, the high temperature oxidation mechanisms are discussed.\n2. Experimental procedures\n\nNickel based Colmonoy 215 (from Colmonoy Company) powder was\ndeposited by plasma transferred arc (PTA) onto specimen blocks of gray\ncast iron, currently used in the production of molds for the glass indus-\ntry. The deposits were executed using a Commersald Group ROBO 90\nmachine using two different arc currents (100 and 128 amperes). The\ngoal of using two different arc currents was to achieve coatings with dis-\nsimilar levels of dilution with the substrate. The nominal compositions\nof the cast iron and Colmonoy 215 powder are displayed in Table 1.\nThe principal surfacing parameters employed are shown in Table 2. Be-\nfore coating, the blocks of cast iron were induction heated at 480 \u00b0C, in\norder to reduce susceptibility to cracking during coating deposition.\n\nAfter coating, specimens containing cast iron and coating were re-\nmoved from each block for microstructural analysis. Metallographic\nanalysis was done using conventional procedures. Small samples for ox-\nidation tests were also removed from each coating. The surfaces of these\nsamples were ground using number 1000 SiC abrasive paper in order to\nproduce even surface preparations. Further, the specimens were ultra-\nsonically cleaned in alcohol.\n\nIsothermal oxidation tests were conducted at 800 and 900 \u00b0C in air\nfor 2 h in a thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) machine. The air flux\nused was 50 ml/min and the heating rate up to the isothermal temper-\nature was 20 \u00b0C/min. After thermal exposure the samples were cooled\nnaturally in air to room temperature. The weight gain of samples was\nevaluated at regular 2 s intervals using a microbalance with an accuracy\nof 0.01 mg. After oxidation the surface morphology of specimens was\nTable 2\nMain deposition parameters for PTA weld surfacing.\n\nMain arc\ncurrent (A)\n\nPowder feed\nrate (rpm)\n\nTravel speed\n(mm/s)\n\nPowder feed gas flow\nrate (l/min)\n\nPla\nrat\n\nCoating 1 100 20 2 2 2.2\nCoating 2 128 20 2 2 2.2\nexamined by scanning electron microscopy with x-ray spectroscopy\n(SEM-EDS). Further, the same equipment was used to identify the layers\nforming the oxide scale from the cross?section of samples. In this case\nthe specimens were mounted in epoxy resin, polished and then surfaced\nwith a thin layer of gold for perfect observation. X-ray diffraction (XRD)\nusing Co K? radiation was conducted on the oxidized surface of speci-\nmens. In order to ensure the reproducibility of results, three specimens\nwere analyzed for each coating and set of test conditions.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Microstructure of the as-deposited coatings\n\nFig. 1 displays the microstructure of the coatings deposited on the\nsurface of gray cast iron coupons. The coatings show dense micro-\nstructure without lack of fusion of the substrate, free of microcracks\nand few solidification voids. Their typical microstructure consists of\ndendrites of the Ni-Fe solid solution phase aligned along the direction\nof heat flow. Furthermore, it displays C-flakes (dark-floret like struc-\ntures) randomly distributed in the matrix. The increase in arc current\ngives rise to a higher dilution of the gray cast iron, changing the orig-\ninal chemical composition of the filler metal. Following the procedure\ndetailed in reference [9], dilutions of 28% and 54% were measured for\nthe coatings deposited using 100 and 128 A arc current, respectively.\nThese levels of dilution can explain the increase in C-flakes with in-\ncreasing arc current, as shown in Fig. 1. Table 3 shows the chemical\ncomposition measured by energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS)\nfrom an area of 400\u00d7400 ?m, from the cross?section at the middle\nthickness of each coating. With this procedure it is assured that chem-\nical composition values are measured from a representative volume of\nmaterial in that zone, avoiding erroneous measurements that could\narise from point analyses of the heterogeneous microstructure. As can\nbe seen, the main differences in chemical composition are related to\nthe higher iron, carbon and silicon contents achieved with increasing\ndilution. The detailed characterization of the microstructure of each\ncoating can be found in a previous publication by the authors [9].\n\n3.2. Isothermal oxidation in air\n\nThe results of the thermo gravimetric analysis performed on the coat-\nings at different isothermal temperatures (800 and 900 \u00b0C) are shown in\nFig. 2a and b for the coatings deposited using 100 and 128 A arc currents,\nrespectively. From now on and throughout the text, the coatings depos-\nited using 100 and 128 amperes will be identified as \u201cC100\u201d and \u201cC128\u201d,\nrespectively. The C100 coating exhibits parabolic oxidation weight gain\nas a function of time for both testing temperatures as does the C128 coat-\ning at 800 \u00b0C. On the other hand, oxidation of the C128 coating at 900 \u00b0C\nstarts with a linear increase in mass gain but after 1400 s it starts to\nsma gas flow\ne (l/min)\n\nShielding gas flow\nrate (l/min)\n\nTorch work\ndistance (mm)\n\nOscillation\n(mm)\n\nPreheat\ntemperature,\n(\u00b0C)\n\n20 13 4 480\n20 13 4 480\n\n\n\nFig. 1.

Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 207 (2012) 196\u2013203\nfollow a parabolic path. The figures also reveals that for both oxidation\ntemperatures, coating C100 displays less oxidation weight gain than\ncoating C128. The dissimilar levels of oxidation observed in the speci-\nmens can be correlated with the dilution promoted by the PTA process,\nthat changed their chemical composition, as shown in Table 3, which\nwill interfere with the oxidation process. As mentioned before, the\nmain differences in chemical composition of coatings are related to sili-\ncon, carbon and, particularly, iron content. Wallwork [14] and Ezugwu\n[15] reported that if iron content is increased in nickel-based alloys, it\ntends to decrease their oxidation resistance, as is the case in our study.\nThis behavior was attributed to a progressively higher cation diffusion\nrate in the scale. Therefore, increasing the dilution of gray cast iron by in-\ncreasing the arc current proves to be detrimental, since the oxidation re-\nsistance of coatings is reduced due to a further increase of iron content in\nthe coatings. Moreover, it is observed that the oxidation gain of speci-\nmens increases with increasing isothermal temperature. This is an\nexpected effect since all diffusion phenomena ruling the oxidation pro-\ncess are enhanced as the temperature is increased. In conclusion, the\nthermo gravimetric results show that increasing dilution decreases the\noxidation resistance of the coatings.\n\n3.3. X-ray diffraction\n\nFigs. 3 and 4 show the XRD spectra found at the oxidized surface of\nthe coatings. The oxide products revealed differences between the two\ncoatings; however, in each coating the phases produced after oxidation\nat 800 and 900 \u00b0C are similar, although different oxidation weight gains\nwere measured. According to XRD patterns, the main oxide phase sets\nTable 3\nNominal chemical composition (wt.%) analyzed at middle thickness of coatings depos-\nited using 100 and 128 A arc current.\n\nElements Ni Fe C Si Al Cr\n\nCoating deposited using 100 A 85.40 8.47 0.30 2.17 0.81 2.86\nCoating deposited using 128 A 51.09 43.29 1.01 2.54 0.50 1.87\ndetected at 800 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C were: (i) B2O3, SiO2 and OAlB for coatings\nproduced with lower dilution and (ii) Fe2O3 (hematite), Fe3O4 (magne-\ntite) and spinels of NiFe2O4 for higher dilution coatings. The indexation\nof oxide phases of coating C128 is in agreement with the results from\nthe literature, where similar oxide phases were detected after thermal\nexposure [16,17]. Both coatings also display a high intensity peak close\nto 60\u00b0, which corresponds to the face centered cubic (Ni-Fe) solid solu-\ntion (ICDD card 47?1405). Furthermore, coating C100 displays low in-\ntensity XRD peaks which correspond to a Ni\u2013Si phase, such as Ni3Si\n(ICDD card 32?0699), and a Cr-boride phase Cr5B3 (ICDD card 32?\n0278). All these phases are currently identified in this type of micro-\nstructure [9]. The large amount of iron oxide detected at the oxidized\nsurface of coating C128 can be attributed to the higher content of iron\nin this sample. As referred to before, the higher iron content in this coat-\ning is attributed to higher dilution of the base material induced by the\nuse of a higher arc current. Comparing the peaks intensity of coating\nC128, oxidized at 800 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C, the amount of oxide products\nFe3O4, Fe2O3 and NiFe2O4 increased with temperature. The NiFe2O4 spi-\nnel phase (ICDD card 10?0325), identified at the oxidized surface, results\nfrom the reaction of NiO (which was also identified as an oxide phase on\nthe surface of coating C128) with the Fe2O3 phase, as reported by Musi?\net al. [18]. Furthermore, B-O phases (ICDD card 06?0297 (B2O3) and\nICDD card 50?1505 (B6O)) could be identified from the XRD pattern of\ncoating C128.\n\n3.4. Surface morphology\n\nThe different chemical compositions of coatings brought about by di-\nlution led to the formation of different kinds of oxide scales during iso-\nthermal oxidation, as shown above. The SEM surface morphologies of\nthe oxidized coatings at 900 \u00b0C are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 for coatings\nC100 and C128, respectively. EDS examinations were conducted of the\noxidized surface of coatings to characterize their composition. Coating\nC100, oxidized at 900 \u00b0C, displays two phases: a gray dark phase, identi-\nfied in Fig. 5a by letter A, and an evenly distributed white phase,\nindentified by letter B. A magnification of each zone is shown in Fig. 5b\nFig. 2.

Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 207 (2012) 196\u2013203\nand c in order to better illustrate the phases. EDS analysis reveals that the\ngray phase is rich in boron and oxygen, suggesting that it is a boron\noxide, as identified by XRD analysis. A similar phase was detected by Li\nand Qiu [19], and Lavrenko and Gogotsi [20] after oxidation of boron\ncarbide powder in air, ranging from 500 to 800 \u00b0C and, oxidation of\nhot-pressed boron carbide in air up to 1500 \u00b0C, respectively. They ob-\nserved that even if the isothermal oxidantion temperature exceeds the\nmelting point of the boron trioxide (about 577 \u00b0C), after cooling it is pos-\nsible detect cristaline boron oxide. According to them, at a temperature\nclose to 577 \u00b0C the boron oxide melts, covering the oxide surface and\nserving as protective layer. Therefore, oxygen is inhibited from passing\ninward and metal atoms from passing outward through the oxide\nlayer. Above a threshold temperature, liquid boron oxide starts to evap-\norate, but only after1000 \u00b0C does this evaporation becomes significant.\nTherefore, when the oxidation temperature is below 1000 \u00b0C, during\ncooling down to room temperature, it is expected that boron oxide\nwill solidify on top of the oxidized surface of the material. The white\nphase appears associated with spalling zones and cracks. The EDS anal-\nysis shows that different phases coexist in this zone. A zone rich in\nboron (see peak ID 2) and another rich in silicon (see peak ID 3) were\nidentified, as shown in Fig. 5c. These results matched with XRD analysis\nwhich suggest that the main phases of the oxidized surface are boron\nand silicon oxides, which are responsible for oxidation resistance of\nthe coating due to their protective character [17,19\u201321]. Moreover, a\nfloret-like structure appears to be frequently associated with the\nwhite phase, as shown in Fig. 5d. The EDS results (see peak ID 4)\nshow that the elemental composition of this oxide is rich in aluminium.\nTaking into account the XRD results it can be concluded that the main\nphase of the floret-like oxide is OAlB. The morphology and indexation\nof this phase named aluminum borate whiskers, matches well with\nthat studied in references [22,23].\n\nHowever, analysis of the oxidized surface of coating C128 at 900 \u00b0C\nreveals that the oxide morphology is different from that of coating\nC100 (see Fig. 6a). It displays a microstructure with uniformly distribut-\ned irregular ditches and dissimilar phases. A magnification of the micro-\nstructure is shown in Fig. 6b to make this clearer and more easily\ncharacterized. The EDS analysis reveals that the phase with irregular\nditches (peak ID 1) is rich in iron and oxygen, suggesting an iron\noxide, as identified in the XRD pattern. Further XRD analysis revealed\nthat the oxidized surface is composed primarily of Fe2O3 with small\namounts of Fe3O4. This result is in agreement with that of Guo et al.\n[16]. It is possible to identify other small features such as another\nphase rich in iron (see peak ID 2 relating to the angular particles) for\nwhich EDS analysis shows the presence of nickel. The combination of\nNi with the Fe2O3 phase can give rise to NiFe2O4 spinels which were\nalso identified by XRD. Furthermore, particles of carbon (dark phase)\ncould be detected at the oxidized surface of the coating, as shown by\npeak ID 3. Finally a phase rich in nickel, oxygen, carbon, silicon and\nboron (see peak ID 4) was detected at the oxidized surface of coating\n128 A explaining the Ni\u2013O, and B\u2013O phases identified in the XRD\npattern of the specimen.\n\n3.5. Cross?section of oxidized samples\n\nThe microstructures of cross-sections of the oxide scale of coatings\nC100 and C128, after oxidation and testing at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h, are pres-\nented in Figs. 7a and b, respectively. The oxide scale is about 5 ?m\nthick for the specimen coated using the lower arc current and 10 ?m\nthick for that using the higher current. Decarburization of coating\nC128 close to the surface is also revealed. Comparing this cross?section\nwith the oxide scale of the same coating oxidized at 800 \u00b0C (Fig. 8) it is\npossible to conclude that at this temperature there is no decarburization\nof the specimen. Zones of silicon segregation were found near the inter-\nface in both coatings (C100 and C128) annealed at either temperature,\nas shown, as an example, by the EDS analysis performed on the phase\nmarked with number 1 in Fig. 7c for coating C128 oxidized at 900 \u00b0C.\n\nThe structure of the oxide scale will be discussed separately for each\ncoating, in order to more clearly illustrate its composition and the role of\nthermodynamic stability and transport mechanisms in the establish-\nment of layered structures.\n\nFig. 9 shows SEM images in secondary and backscattered electrons of\ncross?sections of the oxide scales of coatings C100 and C128 at 900 \u00b0C.\nThe oxide layers are complex and composed of a mixture of phases.\nEDS analyses were conducted on the cross?section of the oxide scales,\nin order to characterize the different oxides formed during isothermal\noxidation. Table 4 summarizes the EDS analyses performed at the points\nmarked in the figures. The values plotted in this table indicate the ratio\nbetween the peak intensity of each element with the peak intensity of\noxygen for each EDS spectrum. This means that at each point analyzed,\na relative increase in this ratio for one particular element is a result of\nthe preferential formation of the oxide of that element over the others.\nCombining SEM images with EDS results, plotted in Table 4 it can be con-\ncluded that the oxide scale of coating C100 is mainly composed of silicon\noxide (as the phase identified with point 1 suggests), with small\namounts of a dark phase rich in nickel, silicon, aluminum and boron\n(see phase identified with point 2) uniformly distributed through the\nlayer. This agrees well with the XRD pattern and the indexed Si-O,\nNi-Si and O-Al-B phases detected. In addition, it is possible to identify a\nphase rich in boron, normally located at the top of the oxidized surface\n(point 3), suggesting a boron oxide, as also revealed by XRD. Moreover,\na Ni-rich white phase (see point 4) appears at the interface between\nthe coating and the oxide layer, corresponding to the remaining part of\n\nimage of Fig.?4\nimage of Fig.?3\n\n\n200 F. Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 207 (2012) 196\u2013203\nthe original source of elements which diffused outwards to form oxide\nscales.\n\nThe oxide scale of coating C128 is different from that of coating C100,\nbeing composed of two layers. Combining the XRD analysis, with the\nSEM-EDS results, the external layer can be identified as Fe2O3, the main\nphase containing small features of Fe3O4 and spinel NiFe2O4. On the\nother hand, the internal layer is composed of a continuous Fe\u2013O rich\nphase (phase identified with point 2) with small evenly distributed\namounts of a dark oxide rich in silicon, nickel and iron, as point 3 of\nEDS analysis shows. The lower iron content in the internal layer in rela-\ntion to the external one suggests that the internal Fe\u2013O rich phase re-\nspects the Fe3O4 oxide. This result is coherent with the oxidation of\nFe-based materials and so hematite (Fe2O3) and spinel of NiFe2O4 can\nbe expected to form in the region of higher oxygen potential while mag-\nnetite (Fe3O4) will form in the lower oxygen potential region [24]. Simi-\nlar iron oxide layers were observed by Guo et al., after oxidation of Fe\u2013\n36% Ni bicrystals in air at high temperature [16]. Between these outer\nand inner layers, a continuous thin layer of a dark phase appears at the\ninterface, as revealed by SEM. A boron rich phase could be detected at\nthe top of the outer layer (see point 4), which is in good agreement\nwith the boron oxide detected by XRD. Finally, clusters of carbon are dis-\ntributed evenly in the oxide layers. The accumulation of C at the interface\nFig. 5. A) SEM observation of surface morphology of the coating deposited using 100 A arc c\ntified in A), D) magnification of the zone C identified in C). SEM/EDS spectra of: E) zone 1,\nbetween the coating and the oxide scale (point 5) is a consequence of the\noxide layer serving as a diffusion barrier for C coming from the decarburi-\nzation of the sample mentioned above. Analogous oxide products were\nobserved in the cross?sections of the oxide scale of coating C128 oxidized\nat 800 \u00b0C.\n\nA good correlation was found between the scale microstructure and\nthe isothermal oxidation curve of coating C100 oxidized at 900 \u00b0C. The\noxidation kinetics of metals and alloys is often controlled by a parabolic\nrate law at high temperature [25] due to the presence of protective scales.\nThis may well be the case in this specimen, as the evolution of the oxida-\ntion weight gain is controlled by the silicon oxide, the main phase present\nin the oxide scale, as suggested by Fig. 9. At lower temperatures, a boron\noxide starts forming on the surface of the specimen due to the high affin-\nity of boron to oxygen. However, for higher temperatures, due to the in-\ntense segregation of silicon through the interface and its great affinity for\noxygen, a silicon oxide layer starts to be formed beneath the boron oxide.\nAt the same time small amounts of Ni\u2013Si and O\u2013Al\u2013B phases are formed\ndue to the diffusion of other elements through the interface. At a temper-\nature of approximately 577 \u00b0C, boron oxide melts, covering the oxidized\nsurface of the coating and inhibiting the transport of species though the\nmelted oxide layer.

Finally, due to the continuous segregation of silicon, its oxide\nlayer will progressively thicken. A protective layer was therefore\nestablished and the reaction rate becomes governed by the rate of species\ndiffusion through this thicker silicon oxide layer, as observed in the cross?\nsection of the oxide scale of the specimen. As with coating C100, a strong\ncorrelation can be found between the microstructure of the oxide scale\nand the isothermal oxidation curve of coating C128. At 800 \u00b0C, parabolic\nbehavior is displayed; however, at 900 \u00b0C, two steps can be detected, see\nFig. 2b. The isothermal oxidation curve at first exhibits a linear increase in\nmass gain and then starts to conform to a parabolic law. The microstruc-\ntural analysis of the cross-section of the oxide scale revealed that at\n800 \u00b0C there is no decarburization of the coating, which is not what\nwas observed at 900 \u00b0C. Like the specimen coated using the lower arc\ncurrent, at low temperatures boron oxide starts forming on the surface\nof specimen due to the high affinity of boron to oxygen. Moreover, for\nhigh temperatures, due to the high iron content, a consistent layer of\nFe2O3 with small features of Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 is formed, which is thick-\nened by outward Fe diffusion. At the same time the specimen loses car-\nbon by decarburization, due to the formation of CO2. However, carbon\n28 A arc current oxidized at 900\u00b0C: A) and C) in back-scattered SEM images, B) and D) in SEM\n\nimage of Fig.?8\nimage of Fig.?9\n\n\n203F. Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 207 (2012) 196\u2013203\nhas increasing difficulties diffusing outwards through the oxide layer and\nstays either inside or beneath the oxide scale, as shown by morphological\nanalysis of the cross-section. Therefore, after the first step where the\nweight gain is partially compensated by C liberation, the oxidation\ncurve will deviate to a normal parabolic trend. According to the\nRichardson-Ellingham diagram, Si has higher affinity for O than Ni and\nFe, and Fe forms Fe3O4 more easily than Ni forms NiO. Therefore, during\noxidation it would be expected that Si-O would be the first layer to be\nformed. However, its much lower content in the specimen relative to\niron, indicates that considerable time is required to form a continuous\nand protective SiO2 layer, as suggested by Douglass and Armijo [26]. So,\nafter a critical time a layer of SiO2 starts being formed below the Fe2O3\nscale, but it never becomes thick enough to determine the oxidation ki-\nnetics. Further, due to the continuous segregation of iron through the sur-\nface of the specimen and due to the decrease in oxygen content at the\ncoating's surface as a result of the volume growth of the Fe2O3 layer, a\ncontinuous and consistent Fe3O4 layer starts forming in this zone, with\nsmall uniformly distributed amounts of the dark phase.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis investigation concerned the effect of PTA current variation\non the oxidation behavior in air at 800 and 900 \u00b0C of coatings of a\nnickel-based hardfacing alloy deposited on gray cast iron using two dif-\nferent arc currents (100 and 128 A). Samples were analyzed by thermal\ngravimetric analysis, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron mi-\ncroscopy with energy dispersion spectrometry analysis (SEM-EDS). The\nthermo gravimetric results show that increasing the arc current from\n100 to 128 A decreases the oxidation resistance of coatings, a result\nthat can be correlated with the different chemical compositions of the\ncoatings, promoted by different dilutions of the base material. The\ncoating with lower dilution follows a parabolic oxidation weight gain\nas a function of time, as this behaviour is essentially controlled by the\ngrowth of a Si\u2013O layer. The coating with higher dilution follows the\nsame trend at 800 \u00b0C. However, at 900 \u00b0C two stages in the oxidation\ncurve were detected, the first with a linear increase in mass gain, a com-\npromise between outward Fe diffusion through a growing layer of\nFe2O3 and the loss of carbon by decarburization and formation of CO2.\nThe second step obeys a parabolic law from the moment that C libera-\ntion is impeded by a thickened scale consisting of an external Fe2O3\nphase, with small amounts of Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 spinel rich film, and\nan internal layer of Fe3O4 film with small evenly distributed amounts\nof a dark phase rich in silicon, nickel and iron. In summary, an increase\nin arc current from 100 to 128 A in the deposition of nickel-rich layers\non substrates of cast iron by the PTA process is very harmful, as it\nreduces the oxidation resistance of the coatings at high temperature.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors wish to express their sincere thanks to the Portuguese\nFoundation for the Science and Technology (FCT), through COMPETE\nprogram from QREN and to FEDER, for financial support in the aim of\nthe project number \u201c13545\u201d, as well as for the grant SFRH/BD/68740/\n2010.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] M.

The present study intends to study the abrasion resistance of moulds \nsubmitted for long time at working conditions. The investigation was \nconducted on nickel-based coatings deposited by plasma transferred arc (PTA) \non grey cast iron, using different arc currents. Micro-scale ball cratering \nabrasive wear test was used to evaluate the tribological properties of the  \nas-deposited and heat treated coatings. The results show that micro-scale \nabrasion tests induce grooving and pitting wear mechanisms. Increasing the arc \ncurrent decreased the hardness of the coatings and, consequently, their wear \nresistance. The hardness and wear resistance of the coatings was improved by \nincreasing heat treatment holding time. \n\nKeywords: plasma transferred arc; PTA; Ni-based alloy; wear; ageing; glass \nmoulding; surface engineering. \n\nReference to this paper should be made as follows: Fernandes, F.,  \nRamalho, A., Loureiro, A. and Cavaleiro, A.

Wear and oxidation are the main failure mechanisms that limit the surface life \nof moulds (Cingi et al., 2002). Therefore, it is necessary to protect mould surfaces with \nhard and wear resistant materials. \n\nThe plasma transferred arc (PTA) process has been usually applied to coat the \nsurfaces of moulds and, especially, their edges where the wear is higher. It produces very \nhigh quality deposits, offering optimal protection with minimal thermal distortion of the \nparts, and provides high deposition rate (Gatto et al., 2004). It allows very precise deposit \nlayers of complex alloys on mechanical parts that are subjected to harsh environments, \nsignificantly extending their service life (Siva et al., 2009). However, the hardness and \nthe wear resistance of the coatings are strongly influenced by the dilution of the substrate \npromoted by the PTA process. Low dilution provides coatings with similar chemical \ncomposition to the metal powder added, condition to have an improved wear and \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n    Wear resistance of a nickel-based coating deposited by PTA on grey cast iron 203    \n \n\n    \n \n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n       \n \n\ncorrosion resistance (Balasubramanian et al., 2009). Therefore, it is essential to control \nthe relevant process parameters to minimise the dilution. \n\nA significant number of coating materials, such as cobalt, iron and nickel alloys, can \nbe applied by PTA process to extend the working life of tribological components \nsubjected to wear. In glass industry nickel alloys gain extremely important role in \nprotection of surfaces, due to their excellent performance under conditions of abrasion \nand corrosion at elevated temperature. The microstructure and wear behaviour of  \nnickel-based hard-facing alloy deposits have been studied using various alloy \ncompositions and different substrates. Nickel-based alloys are usually strengthened by \nalloying elements which improve their wear properties (Ezugwu et al., 1998; Chang  \net al., 2010). Technical literature reports a lot of tribological studies done by pin-on-disc \ntests in deposits of Ni alloys on stainless and carbon steels, though the sliding contact \nconditions of pin-on-disc do not reproduce the interaction conditions between melted \nglass and the surface of the mould. Because of that, the ball cratering wear test was \nselected as the first step to investigate the micro-abrasion resistance of the coatings at \nroom temperature. \n\nGuo et al. (2011) studied the high temperature wear resistance and wear mechanism \nof NiCrBSi and NiCrBSi/WC-Ni coatings deposited on stainless steel by laser cladding. \nThey found that the wear resistance of the coatings is much greater than that of stainless \nsteel when sliding against Si3N4 counterpart ball. Furthermore, NiCrBSi/WC-Ni \ncomposite coating showed better wear resistance at high temperature than NiCrBSi \ncoating. Kesavan and Kamaj (2010), who worked with a Colmomoy 5 hard-facing alloy \ndeposited by PTA on a stainless steel, studied the room and high temperature wear \nbehaviour using pin-on-disc wear tests. They showed that the wear resistance of the \ncoatings improved significantly with increasing test temperature. Further, they observed \ndifferent operating wear mechanisms depending on the sliding and testing temperature. In \nturn, Gurumoorthy et al. (2007) studied the sliding wear of a nickel hard-facing alloy \nAWS NiCr-B deposited on the same stainless steel at three different temperatures  \n(room temperature, 300\u00b0C and 500\u00b0C), and the influence of an ageing treatment on its \nmicrostructure, hardness and wear behaviour. The investigation revealed a significant \nweight loss at room temperature and an abrupt decrease in mass loss at high temperature. \nHowever, after ageing treatment they demonstrated that there is no significant change in \nthe weight loss or the wear behaviour at room and high temperature. \n\nSince wear and oxidation are the main drawbacks that limit the surface life of glass \nmoulds, the aim of this research is to study the effect of PTA current on the \nmicrostructure, hardness and three-body abrasion behaviour of a nickel-based hard-facing \nalloy coating deposited on grey cast iron. Ageing studies were also conducted to evaluate \nthe influence of temperature holding time on the microstructure, hardness and tribological \nproperties of the coating processed with the highest current. \n\n2 Experimental procedure \n\nA nickel-based hard-facing alloy named Colmonoy 215 (from Colmonoy Company) was \ndeposited on flat surfaces of grey cast iron blocks by PTA process. Before coating, each \ncast iron block was preheated at 480\u00b0C, in order to reduce the thermal shock and cooling \nrate to avoid cracks in both the coating and heat-affected zone.

The composition of cast \niron and metal powder is given in Table 1 and the process parameters used in Table 2. \nAfter coating, the blocks were left to cool to room temperature. Samples were removed \nfrom each block, transversely to welding direction, for further analysis. Ageing studies \nwere carried out at 500\u00b0C for 5, 10 and 20 days on specimen 3. \nTable 1 Nominal chemical composition (wt.%) of substrate and hard-facing alloy \n\nBase material C Mn Si P S Cr Ni Mo V Ti Fe \n\nGrey cast iron 3.60 0.60 2.00 &lt;0.20 &lt;0.04 &lt;0.20 &lt;0.50 0.50 0.10 0.20 Balance \nHard-facing C Cr Si B Fe Al F Co Ni   \nNi-alloy   0.14 2.45 2.56 0.86 1.08 1.30 0.01 0.08 Balance \n\nTable 2 Deposition parameters for PTA weld surfacing. \n\n Main arc current \n(A) \n\nPowder feed rate \n(rpm) \n\nTravel speed \n(mm/s) \n\nPowder feed gas \nflow rate (l/min) \n\nSpecimen 1 100 20 2 2 \nSpecimen 2 128 20 2 2 \nSpecimen 3 140 20 2 2 \n\n Plasma gas \nflow rate \n(l/min) \n\nShielding gas \nflow rate \n(l/min) \n\nTorch work \ndistance \n\n(mm) \n\nOscillation \n(mm) \n\nPreheat \ntemperature \n\n\u00b0C \nSpecimen 1 2.2 20 13 4 480 \nSpecimen 2 2.2 20 13 4 480 \nSpecimen 3 2.2 20 13 4 480 \n\nMicrostructural analysis was done in cross section of the samples. Optical and scanning \nelectron microscopies (OM and SEM) were used to characterise the microstructure of the \ncoatings. Vickers micro-hardness profiles were measured in the cross section of treated \nsamples using a load of 5 N. \n\nMicro abrasive wear tests were carried out in as-deposited and heat treated surfaces at \nroom temperature in a ball cratering devices. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the \nequipment used. In this test a specific normal load is applied to press a rotating ball into \nthe flat surface of the coated sample in the presence of a slurry suspension of abrasive. \nThe abrasive slurry, agitated by a magnetic stirrer, was continuous and gravitationally \ndrip fed onto the rotating ball to produce a spherical cup depression. Preliminary tests \nusing different contact conditions were done to reproduce the interaction conditions in the \nsurface of the moulds which have been in service for a long time. The wear mechanism \nwas studied by SEM. High purity silica SS40 with angular particles of averaging of  \n3.10 ?m in size was used as an abrasive to replicate the effect of the melted glass. The \nslurry used was prepared with a concentration of 103 g per 1 \u00d7 10\u20134 m3 of distilled water. \nA steel ball bearing (AISI 52100) with 0.0254 m was used. Several scars were made in \neach sample with different durations, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 turns, respectively 7.98, \n15.96, 23.94, 31.92, 39.90 meters of sliding distance for all the specimens, under the \naction of a normal load of 0.1 N.

The dimensions of spherical depressions were measured in order to calculate the \nwear volume, which is given by the equation (1). In this equation, R represents the ball \nradius and b the crater chordal diameter of the spherical cup depression. The b value was \nevaluated using the average of two perpendicular measurements performed at the wear \nscar chordal diameter. Those values were measured with a Mitutoyo Toolmaker \nMicroscope with x-y micrometer table. \n\n( )4V ? b (64 R)= \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7  (1) \n\nIn order to obtain the specific wear rate, to quantify the wear behaviour, Archard\u2019s law \nwas applied, see equation (2). This is the most applied law to determine a parameter to \nquantify the wear behaviour of materials. In this equation, P is the normal load, l is the \nsliding distance and k is the specific wear rate. \n\nV k P l= \u00d7 \u00d7  (2) \n\nTo quantify the specific wear rate a linear approach of Archard\u2019s model was applied and \na statistical analysis was used to estimate the error of measurements, as described \nelsewhere (Ramalho, 2010). \n\nFigure 1 Schematic diagram of the micro-scale abrasion tests \n\n \n\n3 Results \n\n3.1 Microstructure \n\nFigure 2 shows the microstructure of the coatings performed using different arc currents \n[Figures 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c)], as well as the fusion boundary of specimen 3 [Figure 2(d)], \nand SEM pictures of specimen 3 before and after heat treatment [Figures 2 (e) and 2(f)]. \nThe typical microstructure of deposits consists of dendrites of Ni-Fe solid solution phase \nwith columnar morphology oriented along the direction of heat flow, with C-flakes (dark \nfloret-like structures) randomly distributed. However, near the interface it was observed \nthe presence of a cellular microstructure finer than the dendrite structure with diminution \nof the size of C-flakes, as illustrated in Figure 2(d) for specimen 3.

(2004) and Navas et al. (2006). Moreover, the \npresence of the \u2018dark\u2019 phase on the coatings cannot be explained by the chemical \ncomposition of the metal powder added, so it can be only attributed to the high dilution of \ncast iron induced by the PTA process. The dilution was evaluated by the ratio between \nthe area of the melted base material and the total area of the melted zone, both measured \nin the cross section of the coatings. Dilutions of 28%, 50% and 59% were measured \nrespectively for specimen 1, 2 and 3. These results agree with the observed increasing \nproportion of C-flakes for higher arc currents, as can be seen in Figures 2(a), 2(b) and \n2(c). Therefore, the chemical composition of the coatings is largely influenced by the \ndilution of cast iron. A detailed characterisation of this type of coatings can be found in a \nprevious publication of the authors (Fernandes et al., 2011). \n\nFigure 2 Microstructure of (a) specimen 1, (b) specimen 2, (c) specimen 3, (d) interface of \nspecimen 3 and SEM pictures of sample 3 (e) in non-heat-treated condition and  \n(f) in heat treated condition during ten days \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n    Wear resistance of a nickel-based coating deposited by PTA on grey cast iron 207    \n \n\n    \n \n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n       \n \n\nTable 3 SEM chemical analysis of the deposit and base material of specimen 3 \n\nElements wt%  \n\nC Al Si Cr Fe Ni \n\n \n\n1 0.8 0.7 2.6 1.4 54.7 39.8 Deposit \n2 0.8 0.7 2.8 1.6 54.8 39.2  \n3 0.9 1.4 2.5 1.9 50.4 42.8  \n4 1.6 1.1 2.2 1.4 59.4 34.2 Interface \n5 3.9 - 2.7 - 93.3 - Base material \n\nFigure 3 SEM magnification of microstructure of the coating 3 (a) in non-heat treated condition \nand (b) in heat-treated condition after ten days exposed at 500\u00b0C and SEM EDAX \nspectra of (c) point 1, (d) point 2, and (e) point 3 (see online version for colours) \n\n  \n\n  \n(c)     (d) \n\n \n(e) \n\nTable 3 shows the chemical composition in area measured by SEM-EDS at various zones \non the coating and the substrate of specimen 3.

(1998) reported that the \nincrease of iron content in the coatings tends to decrease their oxidation resistance, \nbecause of the formation of a less adherent oxide scale. \n\nFigures 2(e) and 2(f) reveals that the heat treatment induces significant changes in the \noriginal microstructure of specimen 3. It promotes the formation of a white phase on the \ngrain boundaries. Magnifications of the two microstructures are shown in Figure 3.  \nSEM-EDS spectra analyses were conducted on the coatings to give a detailed \ncharacterisation of their microstructure. From the EDS analysis, it can be stated that the \ngrain boundaries of the non-heat-treated sample is formed by two phases: a light grey  \nand a dark grey rich in chromium and silicon, respectively. Inversely, the specimen  \nin heat-treated condition is formed by the light grey phase as observed in the  \nnon-heat-treated sample and a new phase (white phase) which is replacing the dark phase. \nThe amount of the white phase grows with increasing time of heat treatment. According \nto Fernandes et al. (2011), who studied a nickel alloy deposited on grey cast iron, the \ndark grey phase is a Ni3Si phase. The EDS spectrum reveals that both phases (the dark \nand the white) are rich in Ni-Si. However, the white phase presents a higher content of \nphosphorous on the heat treated sample suggesting a dispersion of Ni-P precipitates on \nthe grain boundaries, as observed by Sahoo and Das (2011) in electroless nickel coatings. \n\nFigure 4 Hardness profile across the interface of (a) as-deposited specimens and (b) specimen 3 \nbefore and after heat treatment (see online version for colours) \n\n  \n(a)     (b) \n\n3.2 Hardness \n\nThe micro-hardness profiles of the different as-deposited and heat treated specimens are \nshown respectively in Figures 4(a) and 4(b). Figure 4(a) reveals that the hardness through \nthe coatings is approximately constant and tends to decrease with increasing arc current. \nThe dilution induced by the PTA process can explain this behaviour. The partial melted \nzone (PMZ) displays the highest hardness. According to Pouranvari (2010), who studied \nthe weldability of grey cast iron using nickel-based filler metals, the highest hardness \nobserved in PMZ is due to the formation of hard and brittle phases during surfacing, such \nas martensite and white cast iron. The heat treatment promotes the progressive hardening \nof the coatings with increasing thermal exposure time [see Figure 4(b)]. Some scatter of \nthe hardness values can be observed too. Harsha et al. (2008), who studied the influence \nof CrC in a nickel flame sprayed coatings, observed similar behaviour. According to \nthem, the scatter in the values is due to the presence of a harder eutectic network around \nthe cells. As described before, heat treatment promotes the formation of Ni-P precipitates \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n    Wear resistance of a nickel-based coating deposited by PTA on grey cast iron 209    \n \n\n    \n \n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n       \n \n\non the grain boundaries. The greater hardness observed on the ageing treated samples can \nbe attributed to the presence of these precipitates similarly to what is currently observed \nin Ni-P electroless coating when annealed at increasing temperatures (Sahoo and Das, \n2011). This type of coatings is a supersaturated alloy in the as-deposited state and can be \nstrengthened by the precipitation of nickel phosphide crystallites. The phosphides act as \nbarriers for dislocation movement and improve the mechanical strength of the coatings. \n\n3.3 Wear behaviour of coatings \n\nMicro-scale abrasion tests were performed on the coatings at room temperature to predict \nthe effect of the different process parameters on their wear behaviour. The goal in a first \nstep was to study the abrasion resistance present in the surface of in-service moulds, in \norder to quantify the wear loss of coatings. The response of materials under micro \nabrasion tests depends on the nature of the motion of particles in the contact zone, which \ndetermines the stress state arising near the contact. Three-body wear mechanism  \n(rolling or pitting) and two-body wear mechanism (grooving), or a combination of both \nmechanisms could be detected. Rolling occurs when the abrasive particles are able to free \nrotate between the sphere and the material in test; on the other hand, grooving occurs if \nthe particles follow the rotation of the sphere, scratching the specimen surface (Ramalho \net al., 2011; Gant and Gee, 2011). In spite of this general tendency to the occurrence of \nthree-body or two-body abrasion, the characteristics of the materials will influence the \nprocess; mild materials will stabilise the grooving mode. \n\nFigure 5 Evolution of the wear volume as function of the parameter \u2018normal load \u00d7 sliding \ndistance\u2019 of (a) as-deposited coatings and (b) specimen 3 before and after thermo \nexposure at 500\u00b0C during several days (see online version for colours) \n\n  \n(a)     (b) \n\nThe results of the micro-scale abrasion tests from specimens in as-deposited and heat \ntreaded conditions are plotted respectively in Figures 5(a) and 5(b), as the material \nvolume loss as a function of the product of the sliding distance (l) by the normal load (P). \nThe reliability analysis of the data is presented in Table 4 and the confidence interval for \nthe specific wear rate plotted in Figure 6. For each sample, a straight linear trend was \nfitted to the experimental points in order to obtain the specific wear rate, which \ncorresponds to its slope [see equation (2)]. From Figure 5(a), it is possible to conclude \nthat specimen 1 exhibits slightly lower specific wear rate, therefore it is the more resistant \nto wear. This result is in accordance with its greater hardness when compared to the  \nothers as-deposited coatings. Specimens 2 and 3 displays similar wear volumes, which is \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n   210 F.

However, the specimen exposed during 20 days exhibits \nlower specific wear rate, therefore, it is the most resistant to wear. This last result is again \nin accordance with the higher hardness of this sample after the heat treatment. \nTable 4 Results of the linearisation analysis of samples in as-deposited and heat treated \n\nconditions \n\nSpecific wear rate, k(mm3/N m)  \n\nAverage STD Confidence interval 90% r2 \n\nSpecimen 1 2.83 \u00d7 10\u20133 2.65 \u00d7 10\u20134 2.20 \u00d7 10\u20133 to 3.45 \u00d7 10\u20133 0.974 \nSpecimen 2 3.44 \u00d7 10\u20133 3.78 \u00d7 10\u20134 2.55 \u00d7 10\u20133 to 4.33 \u00d7 10\u20133 0.965 \nSpecimen 3 3.45 \u00d7 10\u20133 2.14 \u00d7 10\u20134 2.94 \u00d7 10\u20133 to 3.95 \u00d7 10\u20133 0.989 \nAfter 5 days at 500\u00b0C 3.69 \u00d7 10\u20133 5.57 \u00d7 10\u20135 3.56 \u00d7 10\u20133 to 3.83 \u00d7 10\u20133 0.999 \nAfter 10 days at 500\u00b0C 3.73 \u00d7 10\u20133 1.91 \u00d7 10\u20134 3.28 \u00d7 10\u20133 to 4.18 \u00d7 10\u20133 0.992 \nAfter 20 days at 500\u00b0C 2.58 \u00d7 10\u20133 3.18 \u00d7 10\u20134 1.83 \u00d7 10\u20133 to 3.33 \u00d7 10\u20133 0.956 \n\nFigure 6 Confidence interval for a confidence level of 90%, for the specific wear rate of \nspecimens in as-deposited and heat treated conditions (see online version for colours) \n\n \n\nIn order to identify the wear mechanisms and to compare the worn surfaces with those \nobserved in the surface of moulds, SEM examinations were carried out. Figure 7(a) \ndisplays a SEM micrograph of the surface of a coating of a mould after long time in \nservice. From this picture is possible to see that the surface failure regions display pits \nand cracks. Considering the in-service conditions the surface damage probably was \ninduced by synergetic effects of several mechanisms, namely thermal fatigue, corrosion \nand abrasion. However, pitting is the main active failure mechanism of the moulds. \nFigures 7(b) and 7(c) illustrates spherical cup depressions induced by the micro-scale \nabrasion tests on the specimen 3, before and after holding time for 20 days, produced \nafter 500 ball rotations. Both scars display similar wear behaviour with two modes of \nwear: three-body abrasion (pitting) and two-body abrasion (grooving).

Although the \nscars displayed two modes of wear it can be stated that the region corresponding to  \nthree-body mode reproduces closely the wear mechanism present in the moulds surface. \nHowever, one should keep in mind that these results do not reproduce with accuracy the \nin-service condition of the moulds, since in service they are exposed to other damage \nmechanisms such as thermal and mechanical fatigue, oxidation and corrosion at high \ntemperature. \n\nFigure 7 SEM micrograph (a) of the surface of a coating of a mould after long exposure to high \ntemperature, (b) scar with 500 rotations induced by the micro-scale abrasion tests on \nspecimen 3, and (c) scar with 500 rotations induced by the micro-scale abrasion tests on \nspecimen 3 after thermal exposure for 20 days (see online version for colours) \n\n \n\nFigure 8 SEM micrograph of (a) three-body abrasion and (b) two-body abrasion \n\n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n   212 F.

The influence of the arc current used in PTA process, \nas well as the effect of heat treatments, on the microstructure, hardness and wear \nresistance of the coatings was analysed. The increase in arc current increased the dilution \nof the base material changing the composition and microstructure of the deposits and \nreducing their hardness. Furthermore, the wear loss of material increased with increasing \narc current. The micro-scale abrasion tests displayed two modes of wear: three-body \nabrasion (pitting) and two-body abrasion (grooving). Although the scars displayed two \nmodes of wear it can be stated that the wear mechanism of the abrasion test reproduces \nwith success the wear mechanism present in the moulds surface. The heat treatment \nperformed on the sample 3 promotes increasing hardness of the coating with thermal \nexposure time. The enhanced hardness of the coatings is partially attributed to Ni-P \nprecipitates on the grain boundaries. Specimen 3 heat treated for 20 days showed the best \nresistance to wear. \n\nFuture experiments will be devoted to study the high temperature abrasion resistance \nof the coatings, in order to reproduce the in service conditions of moulds. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe authors would like to thank the company \u2018Intermolde\u2019, for supplying the coated \nsamples, and the Portuguese Foundation for the Science and Technology (FCT), through \nCOMPETE programme from QREN and to FEDER, for financial support in the aim of \nthe project number \u2018013545\u2019, as well as for the grant SFRH/BD/68740/2010. \n\nReferences \nBalasubramanian, V., Lakshminarayanan, A.K., Varahamoorthy, R. and Babu, S.

Introduction\n\nThe micro-scale abrasion wear test is a suitable experimental\nmethod for evaluating and comparing the abrasive wear perfor-\nmance of a wide variety of materials. This technique has been\nsuccessfully applied to characterize metallic and non-metallic,\nbulk and coating materials, under the influence of a wide diversity\nof abrasive slurries [1,2]. It is well known that in the industry, the\nmain wear problems in components are related to abrasion,\nwhich could co-exist, whether associated or not, with other forms\nof wear, such as adhesion or tribo-corrosion [3\u20135]. The usefulness\nof the laboratory characterization depends on the ability of the\ntest conditions to reproduce real working conditions as closely as\npossible.\n\nIn the micro-scale abrasion test, three distinct wear modes\nhave been identified, three-body or rolling abrasion, two-body or\ngrooving abrasion and the ridging wear mechanism [1,2,5\u20138].\nAdditionally transitions between these wear modes could be\nobserved (rolling to grooving, grooving to ridging and ridging to\nrolling); these are referred to as \u2018\u2018mixed-mode\u2019\u2019 wear mechan-\nisms. Rolling abrasion is characterized by a hertzian type contact\nwhich occurs when the abrasive particles are able to freely rotate\nbetween the sphere and the material in test, producing multiple\nindentations, while grooving occurs if the particles remain fixed\nto the sphere and scratch the specimen surface. On the other\nll rights reserved.\n\nx: \u00fe351 239 790 701.\n\nnandes).\nhand, ridging wear mechanism is produced when the abrasive\nparticles disappear in the contact region, the contact being made\ndirectly between the sphere and the specimen tested. Therefore,\nthe ridging wear mode should be considered as transition from\nabrasion to metal\u2013metal sliding. Furthermore, according to some\nauthors [8,9], associated with the complex regimes above men-\ntioned, tribo-chemical interactions must be taken into account in\nthe wear calculations specially at high applied loads. This phe-\nnomenon is known to enhance wear resistance with an increase\nin applied load due to oxide formation on the surface.\n\nIn order to use micro-abrasion tests to evaluate the abrasive\nwear resistance of a system, either three-body or two-body\nabrasions need to be considered in the study; each wear mode\nis characterized by significantly different values of specific wear\nrate, which can differ by more than one order of magnitude [1,10].\nSome authors stated that, in micro-scale abrasion tests, the rolling\nabrasion wear mode leads to results that are more easily repro-\nduced [11,12]. Williams and Hyncica [13,14] discussed the pos-\nsibility of applying the continuum mechanics abrasion model to\nexplain the wear transitions. They verified that the quantitative\nmodels can be only applied to processes or materials where the\nboundary conditions are well established, which is not the case\nfor the micro-scale abrasion test. Nevertheless, Williams and\nHyncica suggested that the transition from rolling to grooving\nmust be a function of the critical thickness of the abrasive slurry\nin the contact. Following this suggestion, Adachi and Hutchings\n[6] used an indentation model to analyze the grooving wear\nconditions and they proposed a dimensionless parameter for\nthe severity of contact (S0), to be correlated with the transition\n\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/wear\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/wear\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2012.05.018\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2012.05.018\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2012.05.018\nmailto:filipe.fernandes@dem.uc.pt\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2012.05.018\n\n\nFig. 1.

The ratio of hardnesses between the specimen and the\nball, Hs/Hb, was identified as the key parameter in the transition\nfrom three-body to two-body abrasion. The results showed that\nwith increasing severity of contact (S0) a transition from uniform\nthree-body to two-body abrasion occurs through a mixed three\nand two body abrasion regime.\n\nThe technical literature reports several studies undertaken\nusing micro-scale abrasion equipment and describes how the\ndissimilar test conditions (volume fraction of abrasive in the\nslurry, abrasive material, applied load, ball and specimen materi-\nals, sliding distance and surface condition of the ball) influence\nthe dominant wear modes of different materials [1,6,10,15\u201318].\nThe main objective of these studies is to track the dominant wear\nmodes created with different conditions to produce an associate\nwear-mode map, to serve as data to predict the conditions to\nensure either three-body or two-body abrasion. With regard to\nthe type of abrasive material to be used in micro-scale abrasion\ntests, the BS-EN 1071-6: 2007 standard recommends the use of\nSiC F1200 abrasive; however, dissimilar abrasive materials with\ndifferent grain sizes have been used and, normally, the studies\nalso report the use of diamond and Al2O3. It has been shown that\nthe relative wear rates of the materials depended strongly upon\nthe abrasive type selected (abrasive shape and hardness) [19].\nNevertheless, there are few references regarding the use of silica\nas abrasive material. Because silica is the most common abrasive\nmaterial, therefore responsible for the majority of practical abra-\nsion problems, it is important to study the test conditions which\nproduce different wear mechanisms using silica abrasive slurry.\n\nThus, the purpose of this investigation was to study the test\nconditions which produce rolling and grooving wear modes with\nsilica slurry. An associate wear mode-map should be produced to\nuse as data to ensure either one or the other abrasion wear\nmechanism\u2019s intended further aim was to show that the specific\nwear rate essentially depends on the wear mechanisms (rolling or\ngrooving) involved and not on the test conditions employed, since\nthese do not produce changes in the wear mechanism. The wear\ntests were conducted in fixed ball equipment on a nickel-based\nhardfacing alloy coating deposited by PTA \u2013 Plasma Transferred\nArc on gray cast iron. Regimes of wear behavior were identified by\nscanning electron microscope (SEM) and the results were ana-\nlyzed with a focus on the effects of wear mechanisms.\n2. Experimental procedure\n\nIn this study, micro-scale abrasion equipment was used to\nstudy the influence of the test conditions on the dominant wear\nmodes of a nickel-based hardfacing coating. The coating analyzed\nwas produced by plasma transferred arc process (PTA) on a flat\nsurface of gray cast iron using a 128 A arc current. Fig. 1 shows\nthe typical microstructure of the as-deposited coating. As can be\nobserved, the coating has a relatively dense microstructure, free\nof microcracks and few solidification voids with dendrites of\nNi\u2013Fe solid solution phase aligned along the direction of heat\nflow. Furthermore, it displays C-flakes (dark-floret like structures)\nrandomly distributed in the matrix. The chemical composition of\nthe materials, the conditions and the procedure adopted for the\ndeposition and the characterization of the coatings as well as their\nmain physical structural and mechanical properties can be found\nin a previous publication of the authors [20].\n\nFig. 2 represents a schematic diagram of the micro-abrasive\nwear equipment (fixed ball equipment). In this device, a specific\nnormal load is applied to press a rotating ball (located between\ntwo-coaxial shafts) into the surface of the coated specimen\n(placed in a pivoted specimen holder) in the presence of a specific\nabrasive slurry. The abrasive slurry was continuously agitated by\na magnetic stirrer and dropped steadily onto the rotating ball to\nproduce a spherical cup depression. In this investigation, high\npurity silica from Lusosilica, Lda (Portugal) company, with an\naverage particle size of 3.1 mm and hardness around 1000 HV was\nused as abrasive to produce spherical cup depressions in the flat\nsurface of the coated sample. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the silica\nparticles are highly irregular and angular. The particle size\ndistribution is plotted in Fig. 3(b). The slurry was prepared with\ndifferent silica contents (25, 50 and 65 vol%) in distilled water. An\nAISI 52100 steel ball bearing, 25.4 mm in diameter and with a\nhardness of approximately 740 HV, was used as the counterpart\nto produce wear scars in the sample surface. The specimen tested\nhas a hardness of approximately 225 HV. The rotation speed of\nthe ball was kept at 75 rpm (0.1 m/s of tangential speed) in all the\ntests. The coating was tested using three different normal load\nvalues (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 N) and five test durations (50, 80, 150, 200\nand 300 rpm), respectively 4, 6.4, 12, 16 and 24 m of sliding\ndistance. The test conditions are summarized in Table 1.\n\nIn order to produce an evenly prepared surface, the specimen\nwas polished with SiC abrasive paper up to 1000 grit before wear\ntests. A new ball was used in the abrasion tests. The ball\u2019s surface\nwas prepared using the run-in procedure described by Gee et al.\n[21], and the orientation of the ball was changed randomly before\neach test. Following the tests, the wear scars were examined by a\nscanning electron microscope (SEM), in order to discriminate the\ndissimilar wear modes. Abrasion maps of the material volume\nloss as function of the sliding distance were plotted for each value\nof normal load used. The results were discussed in terms of either\nthe tribological properties or the dominant wear mechanisms\ninvolved. The material wear volume was calculated by using Eq. (1).\nIn this equation b represents the crater chordal diameter of the\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Silica abrasive particles. (a) Morphology and (b) particle size distribution.\n\nFig. 4.

All the data was then collected in a single graph, and\nrepresented as function of the volume loss, with the product\nbetween the sliding distance and the normal load, to identify the\nconditions that produce similar wear mechanisms. To quantify the\nspecific wear rate of the material a linear approach to Archard\u2019s law\nwas used. This law is given by Eq. (2). In this equation V represents\nthe wear volume, k is the specific wear rate, N is the normal applied\nload and x is the sliding distance. Moreover, a statistical analysis was\napplied to estimate the error of measurements, as described else-\nwhere [22].\n\nV \u00bc\u00f0f? b4\u00de=\u00f064 ? R\u00de \u00f01\u00de\n\nV \u00bck ?

The\nanalysis carried out in Appendix A, showed that for b/R values up\nto 0.35 the equation assures an error lower than 1%.\n3. Results\n\nThe micro-scale abrasion results for the different test condi-\ntions are shown in Fig. 4. Each graph plots the volume loss (V) as\nfunction of the sliding distance (x), for each normal load. The\nresults of the tests performed with the lowest load (see Fig. 4(a))\nreveal that there are no effective changes in the wear volume with\nthe change in the concentration of abrasive slurry, especially for\nthe scar produced with low sliding distance. Inversely, for the\nhighest load (see Fig. 4(c)), the results show that the material\nvolume loss increases with increasing concentration of abrasive\nand the difference is sharper for higher sliding distances. The tests\nconducted with an intermediary load (see Fig. 4(b)), displayed\nmixed behavior. The scars produced with the lowest concentra-\ntion of abrasive slurry showed lower wear volume than those\nproduced with higher concentrations of abrasive slurry (50% and\n65% in volume), which displayed similar values of material\nvolume loss. Moreover, it is observed that the wear volume\n\n\n\nF. Fernandes et al. / Wear 292\u2013293 (2012) 151\u2013158154\nstabilizes with increasing sliding distance, whatever the concen-\ntration of abrasive used. This behavior could be associated with\ntwo effects: the running-in effect [23] and the variation of the\ncontact area/wear volume ratio throughout the duration of the\ntest. According to Blau [23], the running-in behavior is the net\nresult of simultaneous transitional processes occurring within the\ninterface, which may lead to non-linear evolution of the wear for\nshort sliding distances. Furthermore, at the start of the wear tests\n(with very small craters, consequently with small amounts of the\nradius of the spherical depression) it is well known that the area\nof the crater grows much faster than the volume; at that point,\nthe rate of pressure reduction is greater than the rate of change in\nthe volume, which may also justify the reduction in wear rate. In\nfact, the severity of contact index, proposed by Adachi and\nHutchings [6], is inversely proportional to the crater area; there-\nfore, a sudden increase in the area results in a reduction of the\nseverity index, which will induce a change in the wear rate. The\nchanges in the wear volume described above are only partially\ncorrelated with the test conditions, encouraging the investigation\nof the interactions between the abrasive slurry and the surface of\nthe specimen in the contact zone.

Magnification of the wear mec\nanalyses were conducted on different spherical cup depressions in\norder to identify the wear mechanism produced by the dissimilar\ntest conditions.\n\nFig. 5 shows SEM micrographs of the dissimilar morphologies\nof the spherical cup depressions induced by different test condi-\ntions of the micro-scale abrasion tests. As these images show, two\ndifferent wear mechanisms were identified, rolling abrasion (see\nFig. 5(a)) and grooving abrasion (see Fig. 5(b)). Moreover, a\ncombination of both wear mechanisms (see Fig. 5(c)) was also\nidentified for several contact conditions. In order to facilitate\nidentification of the wear mechanisms present in each worn\nsurface, magnified images are shown in Fig. 5(a1)\u2013(c1). Rolling\nabrasion is characterized by multiple indentations in the worn\nsurface, (see Fig. 5(a1), whereas grooving abrasion (see Fig. 5(b1)\nis characterized by parallel grooves in the worn surface which\nresults from the plastic deformation of the material. In turn, the\nsurface morphology, which displays a mixed-mode (rolling and\ngrooving abrasion), corresponds to a transition zone characterized\nby a mixture of grooves and indentations, as shown in Fig. 5(c1).\nThe transition of rolling to grooving abrasion occurs due to the\nembedding of particles in the surface. In this case grooving starts\nbination of load, volume fraction of abrasive and sliding distance of: (a) 0.5 N, 50%\n\nhanism present in the wear scar of: (a1) Figure a), (b1) Figure b), (c1) Figure c).\n\n\n\nFig. 6.

Furthermore, in the tests performed with\n25 vol% abrasive and a load of 0.5 N, especially for the shorter\ntests, the wear scars displayed areas with ridge wear mechanism,\nas Fig. 6 shows. Normally, this wear mechanism occurs for high\nvalues of normal load when the abrasive particles are absent from\nthe contact region and contact is made directly between the\nsphere and the specimen tested, leading to ridging marks in the\nsurface [8], see zone 1 marked in Fig. 6(a). In this investigation the\nridging points will be disregarded since, in this type of wear, the\nabrasive particles do not influence the formation of the wear scars\nand, therefore, the abrasion mechanism does not consider the\neffect of the abrasive slurry.\n% of volume fraction\n\nof abrasive\nLoad (N)\n\n0.1 0.2 0.5\n\n25 O // //\n\n50 O y //\n65 O y y\n\nO\u2013Rolling wear mechanism, y\u2013Mixed-mode wear\nmechanism and //\u2013Grooving wear mechanism\n4. Discussion\n\nConsidering the cumulative effect of the normal load multi-\nplied by the sliding distance (N?x) product, the wear map for the\ndifferent test conditions was plotted on a wear volume against\nN?x graph by identifying the regimes of interactions based on\nSEM observations. As can be seen in Fig. 7, three well defined\nzones (rolling abrasion zone, grooving abrasion zone and a mixed-\nmode wear) can be perceived. The graph reveals that different\ncombinations of test conditions can produce the same wear\nmechanism. Moreover, it is observed that for some combinations\nof concentration of abrasive slurry and load, the same wear\nmechanism is maintained even if the sliding distance is changed\n(conditions of (50 vol%; 0.1 N), (65 vol%; 0.1 N) and (25 vol%;\n0.2 N)). In these cases the wear volume always increases with\nincreasing sliding distance, even if the dominant wear mechanism\nis grooving or rolling abrasion. However, some conditions of\nabrasive slurry concentration and load are more prone to induce\none type of wear mechanism even when changing the sliding\ndistance. These changes are related to transitions in rolling to\nmixed-mode mechanism and mixed-mode to rolling wear\nmechanisms. For example, the wear scars produced with\n25 vol% abrasive using a load of 0.1 N produces both rolling\nabrasion and the mixed-mode wear mechanism depending on\nthe sliding distance. Table 2 summarizes the main wear mechan-\nisms produced by the different test conditions. The rolling,\ngrooving and rolling\u2013grooving abrasion regimes are differentiated\nby using different symbols. The Table shows that low loads and\nhigh volume fraction of abrasive slurry enable three-body abra-\nsion, while grooving abrasion becomes stable at high loads and\nlow volume fraction of abrasive slurry. These last results are in\ngood agreement with previous studies [6,18].\n\nArchard\u2019s model is a suitable way to estimate a parameter able\nto quantify the wear behavior of materials (the specific wear\nrate). However experimental results only fit the model well if a\nsingle wear mechanism occurs in all the tests. The results\ndisplayed in Fig. 7 show that different combination of test\nconditions can produce the same wear mechanism. So, in this\nstudy the experimental results were organized into two groups\ndepending on the wear mechanism involved; rolling or grooving.\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

For each set of data, a straight linear trend was fitted to the\npoints, obtaining the specific wear rate as the slope of the\nrespective linear trend line, as shown by Eq. (2). A complete\nreliability analysis of the specific wear rate is summarized in\nTable 3 and, for each case, the confidence bands are plotted in\nFig. 8(b) for a confidence level of 90%. The results show that the\nspecific wear rate obtained from the rolling experimental data\npoints is around one order of magnitude higher than in the\ncorresponding grooving points. In fact, the rolling wear mode is\na more effective wear mechanism than the grooving mode,\nleading to higher values of specific wear rate [5,18,24]. Further-\nmore, the reliability of results indicates that the correlation\ncoefficient for the specific wear rate calculated from the rolling\nand grooving points is high, meaning that the quality of the linear\nfittings displayed in Fig. 8 is suitable. Therefore, according to\nthese results, the specific wear rate can be estimated using points\nproduced with different test conditions, since a single wear mode\nis sustained. Furthermore, these results lead to the conclusion\nthat the specific wear rate essentially depends on the wear\nmechanisms (rolling or grooving) involved and not on the tests\nconditions employed, since these do not produce changes in the\nwear mechanism.\n5. Conclusion\n(i)\n In this investigation, silica slurry was used as an abrasive in\nmicro-scale abrasion equipment to study the influence of\ndifferent test conditions on the dominant wear modes of a\nNi-based coating deposited by PTA on gray cast iron.\n(ii)\n The effect of different concentrations of abrasive slurry,\nsliding distances and normal loads on the micro-abrasion of\na Ni-based coating were investigated and showed significant\ndifferences between micro-abrasion rates and wear mechan-\nisms as a function of these parameters.\n(iii)\n The micro-abrasion mechanism maps were represented in\nterms of volume loss as a function of the sliding distance\nmultiplied by the normal load. The results showed that\ndifferent combinations of tests can produce the same wear\nmechanism. Low values of normal load and high contents of\nabrasive particles enable rolling abrasion, while grooving\nabrasion is stabilized at high loads and low volume fraction\nof abrasive slurry.\n(iv)\n The micro-scale abrasion results involving rolling and groov-\ning abrasion data, based on calculations of the specific wear\nrate, revealed that this parameter can be successfully calcu-\nlated using data points produced by dissimilar test condi-\ntions since they give rise to a single wear mode. This result\nled to the conclusion that the specific wear rate essentially\ndepends on the wear mechanisms involved and not on\nthe test conditions employed, since a single wear mode is\nsustained (grooving or rolling abrasion).\n(v)\n Abrasion by rolling wear induced a specific wear rate around\none order of magnitude higher than the value obtained under\ngrooving abrasion.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to express their sincere thanks to the\ncompany \u2018\u2018Intermolde\u2019\u2019, for supplying the coated samples, and\nthe Portuguese Foundation for the Science and Technology (FCT),\nthrough COMPETE program from QREN and to FEDER, for financial\nsupport in the aim of the project number \u2018\u2018013545\u2019\u2019, as well as for\nthe grant (SFRH/BD/68740/2010).\nAppendix A. Error analysis of the equation of the wear\nvolume\n\nThis section aims to elucidate authors about the resultant error by\nusing an approximate equation to calculate the volume of a spherical\ncup depression induced by the micro-scale abrasion tests.\n\nThe original equation used to calculate the volume of the\nspherical cup depression is given by the Eq. (A1), where b and h\nrepresent respectively the crater chordal diameter and the depth\nof the spherical cup depression (see Fig A.1). However, in micro-\nscale abrasion testing an approximate equation of Eq. (A1) is\ncurrently used (see Eq. (A2)). In this equation R represents the ball\nradius of the ball bearing used.

So, discretizing the value of b in small intervals it\nis possible to calculate the associated values of V and Vn for each\nrelation between b and h. The value of h (given by Eq. (A4)), can be\neasily deduced by subtracting the value of c from the value of R, as\nrepresented in Fig A.1. The value of c is obtained by applying\nPythagoras\u2019 Theorem at the triangle. Applying Eq. (A3) at the\ndissimilar combinations of b and h it is possible obtain the error\nassociated by using an approximate equation to estimate the\nvolume of a spherical cup depression induced by the micro-scale\nabrasion test. The results of the error are plotted in Fig A.2, dashed\nline, as function of the ratio between the crater\u2019s chordal diameter\nand the radius of the ball with the relative error associated. As can\nbe seen in this figure, the resulting error is very small for low\nratios of b/R, however with an increase in this ratio, the error\nincreases. For example considering a spherical cup depression\nwith a chordal diameter equal to the radius of the ball, the error\ncommitted in the calculations is about 10 percent.\n\nh\u00bc R?\u00f0R2?\u00f0b=2\u00de2\u00de1=2 \u00f0A4\u00de\n\nThe level of correlation between the ratios of the depth of the\nspherical cup depression and the ball radius with the error proved to\nbe linear. So, according to this relationship it is possible to establish a\ncorrection factor for a desired value of error. For example, for a\ndesired error less than 1% a correction factor can be calculated as\nindicated by Eq. (A5). By manipulating the equation it is possible to\ndetermine the limits as a function of the ratio between b and R (see\nEq. (A6)). Fig A.2 displays the error obtained when the approximate\nequation to estimate the volume of the wear scar is used, correction\nfactor applied (continuous lines) and without the correction factor\n(dashed lines). As can be seen in the figure, the error of using the\nexpression with the corrective factor is one hundred times smaller\nthan that obtained with the expression without the corrective factor.\nAlthough, the correction factor gives more accurate results for low\nratios between the chordal crater and the radius of the ball bearing,\nthe approximate equation to evaluate the volume of a spherical cup\ndepression is appropriate, due to the small error induced.\n\nCF\u00bc\n1 (\u00f0h=R\u00der0:015\n1=\u00f01?0:66 ?\u00f0h=R\u00de\u00de ( 0:015r\u00f0h=R\u00der0:55\n\n(\n\u00f0A5\u00de\n\nCF \u00bc\n1 (\u00f0b=R\u00der0:345\n\n1=\u00f01?0:66 ?\u00f01?\u00f01?\u00f0b=\u00f02 ?

Introduction \n\n \n\nCast irons and copper-alloys are commonly used in the production of glass molds and \n\naccessories for glass industry, owing to their excellent thermal conductivity and relatively low \n\ncost [1]. Molds are often exposed to severe conditions of abrasion, oxidation, wear, fatigue at \n\nhigh temperature, due to repeated contact with melted glass, causing deformation or failure of \n\nmailto:filipe.fernandes@dem.uc.pt\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n126 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nparts and, thus, compromising the product quality and increasing the maintenance costs. To \n\novercome this shortcoming protective coatings are normally applied at molds surfaces with \n\nthe aim of increasing their lifetime in harsh environments [2, 3]. A wide diversity of coating \n\nmaterials have been successfully applied to protect the surface of these components, such as: \n\ncobalt, iron and nickel alloys [2, 4, 5]. The latter have been especially used due to their \n\noutstanding performance under extreme high temperature conditions [5-8]. Several hardfacing \n\nand thermal spraying processes have been used to coat the molds: (i) plasma transferred arc \n\n(PTA) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), (ii) flame spraying (FS), high velocity oxy fuel \n\n(HVOF) and atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). Hardfacing processes have been \n\npreferentially used in the protection of mold surfaces because they promote a strong \n\nmetallurgical bonding between the coating and the substrate, condition required to achieve \n\nhigh quality adherent coatings and to avoid the catastrophic failure in service, as opposed to \n\nthermal spraying processes where only a mechanical bonding is established. Among the \n\nhardfacing processes referred to above, PTA has been widely used to protect the surface of \n\nmolds, since it produces high quality thick coatings, offering both optimal protection with \n\nminimal thermal distortion of parts and high deposition rates in single layer deposits [4, 5]. \n\nHowever, the properties and the quality of deposits are strongly dependent on the dilution of \n\nthe substrate promoted by the PTA process. Low dilution provides coatings with similar \n\nchemical composition to the added metal powder, condition for achieving enhanced \n\nmechanical properties, wear and oxidation resistance [9]. To avoid adhesion problems and, \n\ntherefore, not to compromise the performance of molds in service, it is common to increase \n\nthe dilution through the change of the most relevant deposition parameters even if the \n\nmechanical properties, wear and oxidation resistance are diminished. In our previous studies \n\n[10, 12] the effect of increasing dilution, promoted by change of arc current on the structure, \n\nmechanical properties, oxidation resistance and wear behavior of a nickel-based alloy \n\ndeposited onto a gray cast iron have been investigated. Regarding the wear behavior of \n\ncoatings, ball cratering wear tester has been selected to reproduce the wear mechanism \n\nproduced by the interaction between the melted glass and the surface of molds (three body \n\nabrasion). However, this equipment does not allow consider the high temperature effect. \n\nHence, as a way to complement the previous studies, the aim of this investigation is to study \n\nthe effect of increasing substrate dilution on the tribological performance at room and \n\nessentially at high temperature of as deposited Ni-based coating deposited onto gray cast iron, \n\nusing a pin on disc tribometer apparatus. Comparison of these results with those achieved for \n\nthe base material is also provided. \n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n127 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n2. Experimental procedure \n\n \n\nA nickel-based hardfacing alloy powder named Colmonoy 215 (from Colmonoy \n\ncompany) was deposited by plasma transferred arc using a Commersald Group ROBO 90 \n\nmachine onto flat surfaces of gray cast iron blocks, currently used in the production of molds \n\nfor the glass industry. Two different arc currents (100 and 140 amperes) were used on the \n\ndepositions to produce coatings with two dissimilar levels of dilution. Hereinafter, the \n\ncoatings deposited using 100 and 140 amperes will be designated as C100 and C140, \n\nrespectively. Table 1 gives the optimized parameters used in the depositions, while Table 2 \n\ndepicts the nominal chemical composition of the base material and Colmonoy 215 powder. \n\nBefore coating, the substrate blocks were preheated at 480 \u00baC to reduce the cooling rate and \n\ntherefore to avoid the susceptibility to cracking during deposition. Using the same deposition \n\nconditions, several weld beads, each with approximately 3 to 5 mm thick, were deposited in \n\nparallel on the cast iron, ensuring some overlapping between them in order to obtain a 35\u00d735 \n\nmm coated surface area and a quasi-flat surface. Specimens containing cast iron and coating \n\nwere removed from each block for microstructural and micro-hardness analysis. Further, \n\nspecimens with dimension of 20\u00d720\u00d75 mm were removed from each block for tribological \n\ntesting. The coated surfaces were first machined to provide flatness and then grinded and \n\npolished following standard procedures to obtain a uniform roughness of about 0.51 \u2013 0.62 \n\n\u00b5m. \n\nThe tribological behavior of the coatings and gray cast iron was evaluated at room and \n\nhigh temperatures using a pin-on-disk tribometer. As the operating surface temperature of \n\nmolds is currently in the range of 500 - 900 \u00baC, temperatures of 550 and 700 \u00baC were selected \n\nto perform the experiments. Although in the real working conditions of molds glass acts as an \n\nabrasive material, due to its melted state at high temperature,  for the tribological tests we \n\nhave selected as counterpart a harder and more resistant material: Al2O3 balls. Thus we ensure \n\nthat the wear volume loss of coatings will be overestimated in relation to the expected loss in \n\nactual service conditions. All the wear tests were conducted at a constant linear speed of 0.10 \n\nm.s\n-1\n\n, a load of 5 N, a relative humidity of 48\u00b15%, and 5000 cycles. The radius of the wear \n\ntracks was set to 5.3 mm. During the tests, the friction coefficient was continuously recorded. \n\nTwo tests were performed under identical conditions for each coating. After tribological tests, \n\nthe wear rate of the coatings was determined from the cross section wear track area using a \n\n3D optical profilometer and the wear tracks and wear debris were characterized by scanning \n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n128 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nelectron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and by Raman \n\nspectroscopy. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Main deposition parameters. \n\n \nMain arc \n\ncurrent \n\n(A) \n\nPowder \n\nfeed rate \n\n(rpm) \n\nTravel \n\nspeed \n\n(mm/s) \n\nPowder \n\nfeed gas \n\nflow rate \n\n(l/min) \n\nPlasma \n\ngas flow \n\nrate \n\n(l/min) \n\nShielding \n\ngas flow rate \n\n(l/min) \n\nTorch \n\nwork \n\ndistance \n\n(mm) \n\nOscillation \n\n(mm) \n\nPreheat \n\ntemperature \n\n\u00baC \n\nC100 100 20 2 2 2.2 20 13 4 480 \n\nC140 140 20 2 2 2.2 20 13 4 480 \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Nominal chemical composition (wt.%) of the gray cast iron and nickel-based alloy powder. \n\nBase material C Mn Si P S Cr Ni Mo V Ti Fe \n\nGray cast iron 3.60 0.60 2.00 &lt;0.20 &lt;0.04 &lt;0.20&lt;0.50 0.50 0.10 0.20 Balance \n\n            \n\nHardfacing  C Cr Si B Fe Al F Co Ni \n\nNi-alloy   0.14 2.45 2.56 0.86 1.08 1.30 0.01 0.08 Balance \n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n3.1. Microstructure, composition and hardness of the as deposited coatings \n\n \n\nThe typical microstructure of gray cast iron and coatings produced with 100 and 140 A \n\nis depicted in Fig. 1. Both coatings display relatively dense microstructure with excellent \n\nadhesion to the substrate, free of microcracks and only a few solidification voids. Their \n\ntypical microstructure consists of dendrites of Ni-Fe solid solution phase aligned along the \n\ndirection of heat flow. Flakes of carbon (dark-floret like phase) randomly distributed in the \n\nmatrix can be perceived too, being more notorious on C140 coating. The high amount of dark-\n\nfloret phase on C140 coating is in good agreement with the observed increase of dilution with \n\nincreasing arc current. Following the procedure described in reference [11], dilutions of ~28 \n\nand ~59% were measured for C100 and C140 coatings, respectively. The dilution is beneficial \n\nin terms of improving the adhesion, but it can bring some disadvantages, such as change in \n\nthe hardness and chemical composition, and lowering of wear and oxidation resistance of the \n\ncoatings [9]. The chemical composition of coatings, assessed by SEM-EDS given in Table 3, \n\nwere evaluated from the average of several measurements performed on an area 400\u00d7400 \u00b5m \n\nin the cross section at middle thickness of each coating. This procedure was used to ensure \n\nthat the chemical composition was determined in a representative volume of material in that \n\nzone, thus avoiding problems that punctual analyses can give in heterogeneous materials. The \n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n129 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nresults show that the main differences were in the iron, silicon and carbon contents, in good \n\nagreement with the different dilutions in the samples. The gray cast iron shows flakes of \n\ngraphite evenly distributed in a ferritic matrix. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Optical micrograph of: a) C100 coating, b) C140 coating, c) interface between coating and substrate of \n\nC140 coating, d) gray cast iron. \n\nTable 3 - Nominal chemical composition (wt.%) of coatings evaluated by SEM-EDS. \n\n wt. % of elements \n\nCoating Ni Fe C Si Al Cr \n\nC100 85.40 8.47 0.30 2.17 0.81 2.86 \n\nC140 55.71 37.73 1.26 2.52 0.62 2.16 \n\n \n\nFig. 2 shows the Vickers hardness profiles across the interface of the deposited \n\ncoatings, measured with 5 N applied load. As it would be expected, the increase in the weld \n\ncurrent, and therefore increase in dilution, gives rise to a decrease of the hardness either in the \n\ncoating, undesirable in terms of wear, or in the heat affected zone (HAZ), which is favourable \n\nin terms of toughness of this region. The average surface hardness of coatings C100, C140 \n\nand gray cast iron was 300, 195 and 150 Vickers (HV0.5), respectively. The high hardness of \n\nthe HAZ zone in relation to the non-thermal affected based material is related to the formation \n\nof hard and brittle phases.

Tribological behavior of coatings \n\n \n\n4.1. Wear rate \n\n \n\nFigure 3 shows the wear loss rate of coatings and gray cast iron tested at different \n\ntemperatures. It clearly shows that at room temperature the wear loss of coatings and gray cast \n\niron is very low, and almost independent of the substrate dilution. C100 coating displays a \n\nlittle higher wear resistance than C140 coating, in agreement with its higher hardness. The \n\nobserved similar level of wear rate of the gray cast iron as compared to the Ni coatings at RT \n\nis due to its higher amount of graphite that can act as solid lubricant, leading to a less volume \n\nloss of material. It should be pointed out that the low hardness displayed by the gray cast iron \n\ncompared to the coated samples is compensated by the presence of graphite on the sliding \n\ncontact [13, 14]. \n\nAt temperature of 550 \u00baC an abrupt increase of the wear rate of coatings was observed; \n\nhowever, it dropped with further increase to 700 \u00baC. The first increase of the wear rate can be \n\nattributed to the spontaneous oxidation, while, as it will be seen later, following decrease of \n\nwear loss at 700 \u00baC could be related to the formation of high amount of oxides on the wear \n\ntrack preventing further wear of the coatings. Besides, coating produced with high dilution \n\ndisplayed much higher wear resistance at elevated temperatures than C100 coating.

A continuous increase of the wear \n\nrate with increasing temperature was observed for the gray cast iron. This material showed \n\nmuch higher wear rate than the Ni-based coatings, indicating that the latter should perform \n\nbetter at high temperature. This is an expected result since rapid loss of the material \n\nmechanical strength and increasing oxidation rate with temperature are typical of gray cast \n\niron. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Variation of the wear rate of coatings and gray cast iron with test temperature. \n\n4.2. Friction coefficient \n\n \n\nThe evolution of the friction coefficient of coatings and gray cast iron with increasing \n\ntest temperature is shown in Figure 4. As expected, all the friction curves displayed two \n\ndistinct regions: running-in stage and steady state stage. At RT, the running-in stage for both \n\nNi-based coatings is similar and characterized by strong increase of the friction coefficient to \n\nthe highest value of 0.74, followed by rapid decrease down to 0.41, after the first 1000 laps. \n\nOn the other hand, in gray cast iron, friction coefficient slightly increased over time reaching \n\nthe steady state after 4000 laps with a friction coefficient of about 0.39. Gray cast iron \n\nexhibited relatively low friction coefficient at RT as compared to the Ni-based alloys. \n\nAccording to the literature [13, 14], this behavior is related to the presence of graphite on the \n\nworn surface that acts as a solid lubricant compensating the lower hardness displayed by the \n\nmaterial and thus leading to wear rate values similar to Ni-based coatings. \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n RT\n\n 550 \n0\nC\n\n 700 \n0\nC\n\nCast ironC 140C 100\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-6\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n132 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nA long running-in period was also noticed with a progressive increase of the friction \n\ncoefficient for the gray cast iron when the temperature was 550 \u00baC; however, friction was \n\nmuch higher suggesting different contact conditions. Ni-based coatings displayed very short \n\nrunning-in periods with friction stabilized at similar values as in RT tests. Finally, the tests at \n\n700 \u00baC exhibited different trends between cast iron and coatings. In the first case, a small \n\ndecrease in the final friction coefficient value was achieved whereas an inverse situation was \n\nobserved for coated samples, with friction stabilized at values of approximately 0.6 and 0.65 \n\nfor C100 and C140 coatings, respectively. Such trends suggest that different contact \n\nconditions should have been taking place in both situations. \n\nIn many cases, especially at high temperatures, the friction curves displayed quite \n\nunstable values. According to Kesavan and Kamaj [15], such behavior demonstrates the \n\npresence of tribolayer on the sliding surfaces; the tribolayer is continually worn out and \n\nformed again, which results in short-term friction coefficient oscillations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Friction coefficient evolution with increasing test temperature of: a) C100 coating, b) C140 coating, c) \n\ngray cast iron. \n\n \n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n RT\n\n 550 \n0\nC\n\n 700 \n0\nC\n\na)\n\nC100 Coating\n\nF\nri\nc\nti\no\nn\n c\n\no\ne\nff\nic\n\nie\nn\nt\n\nNumber of cycles\n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n133 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 4 (continued). \n\n4.3. Wear mechanisms and surface analysis of coatings \n\n \n\nThe changes of the wear rates and friction coefficients described above can be \n\nattributed to a great number of factors, such as the chemical composition, physical properties \n\nof materials, or applied test conditions. Therefore, the investigation of the interaction between \n\nthe specimen-counterpart pair was carried out. Scanning electron microscopy with energy \n\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Raman spectroscopy were used to \n\ncharacterize the dominant wear mechanisms and the wear debris originated by the tribological \n\ntesting. \n\n \n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n RT\n\n 550 \n0\nC\n\n 700 \n0\nC\n\nb)\n\nC140 Coating\n\nF\nri\nc\nti\no\nn\n c\n\no\ne\nff\nic\n\nie\nn\nt\n\nNumber of cycles\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n RT\n\n 550 \n0\nC\n\n 700 \n0\nC\n\nc)\n\nGray cast iron\n\nF\nri\nc\nti\no\nn\n c\n\no\ne\nff\nic\n\nie\nn\nt\n\nNumber of cycles\n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n134 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n4.3.1. Worn surfaces at room temperature \n\n \n\nTypical SEM micrographs in secondary electrons of the worn surface of coatings and \n\ngray cast iron tested against Al2O3 balls at RT are depicted in Figure 5. The wear tracks of Ni-\n\nbased coatings are similar; they present a rough morphology with evidence of tribo-oxidation. \n\nThe oxide adhered layer is cracked, which reveals its brittle nature. Raman spectra performed \n\nat the oxidized worn surface of the coatings (see spectra a) and b) in Fig. 6 for C100 and C140 \n\ncoatings, respectively) confirmed the presence of the oxides, namely Raman active modes \n\nassigned to Ni-O [16] and C [17]; the latter almost inexistent in C100 sample spectrum as a \n\nconsequence of its much lower dilution. These results are in good agreement to EDS analysis \n\n(see Fig. 5 d) for C100 coating as an example), which showed essentially strong signals of Ni \n\nand O; vestiges of Fe, Si, Al and C were also detected. Similar wear debris was found on the \n\nwear scars of the balls too. During the wear tests the friction, generated by the sliding of the \n\nball against the coating surface, causes the increase of the local temperature, mainly in the \n\nprotuberances contact, promoting the tribo-oxidation of the surface. During this phase, the \n\nmetal-ceramic contact will progressively decrease with more and more surface being covered \n\nby an oxide phase. With the test running, the oxide tribo-layer will grow and the contact shall \n\nbe governed between this growing tribo-layer and the counterpart, until a steady state will \n\noccur. Metal-ceramic contact gave rise to a higher friction coefficient that should decreases \n\nuntil a constant and lower value corresponding to the same oxide, NiO as shown by Raman \n\nspectroscopy, formed on the top surface. It explains the similar level of wear resistance and \n\nfriction values of the coatings even despite of their discrepancy in hardness and chemical \n\ncomposition due to different dilution levels. The high hardness of the metallic coatings, in \n\nconjunction with the protective effect of the hard NiO oxide, led to very low wear volumes. \n\nDistinct wear behavior was found for the gray cast iron. Its wear track displays a very \n\nclean surface with fine scratches parallel to the relative sliding movement (suggesting \n\nabrasion wear mechanism) and some adherent wear debris. Further, in some places, black \n\nregions can be noticed, which can be attributed to either the presence of graphite or its pull-\n\nout from the material [18]. EDS analysis performed at the wear debris revealed that they \n\nrepresent a mixture of original and oxidized material, including a weak signal from graphite \n\nlamellas. Similar phases were detected on clean worn surface, although C peak was much \n\nmore intense there. Raman spectroscopy analysis showed the presence of hematite (?-Fe2O3) \n\n[19] and nanocrystalline graphite through the characteristic D and G bands [20] (see spectrum \n\nc) and d) of Fig. 6 for wear debris and clean surface, respectively). During sliding \n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n135 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nexperiments the movement of the ball promotes the wear of surface specimen with production \n\nof both oxide and graphite debris. Graphite will act as a solid lubricant in tribo-film, \n\npromoting a decrease of friction coefficient and having, indirectly, an important impact on the \n\nwear [13, 14]. As a consequence, similar level of wear resistance was observed between base \n\nmaterial and coatings, in spite of the lower hardness of gray cast iron. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - SEM morphology in secondary electrons of worn surface of: a) C100 coating, b) 140 coating, c) cast \n\niron; all tested at room temperature. d) SEM/EDS spectra of point 1 marked in Fig. 5 a). e) and f) wear track \n\nprofiles of: C140 coating, and gray cast iron, respectively. \n\n1\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nWear debrisBlack\n\nregions\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\nD\ne\np\nth\n\n (\n\u00b5\n\nm\n)\n\nScan length (\u00b5m)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\nD\ne\np\nth\n\n (\n\u00b5\n\nm\n)\n\nScan length (\u00b5m)\n\ne)\n\nf)\n\n0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6\nKV\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\nC K?\n\nO K?\n\nNi L?\n\nF\ne\n\n L\n?\n\nAl K?\n\nSi K?\n\nd)\n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n136 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Typical Raman spectra performed on the worn surface of: a) C100 coating tested at RT, b) C140 \n\ncoating tested at RT, c-d) adherent wear debris and clean surface of gray cast iron, respectively, tested at room \n\ntemperature. \n\n4.3.2. High Temperature \n\n \n\nWhen sliding occurred at 550 \u00baC, C100 and C140 coatings also showed oxides on the \n\ncontact surface. However, C140 wear track was almost fully covered whereas C100 exhibited \n\nan irregular surface with a mixture of clean wear zones and oxidized ones with signs of \n\nadhesive and abrasive wear (see Fig. 7 a-b), suggesting an incomplete formation of an oxide \n\ntransfer layer. The difference between the two samples can be interpreted considering their \n\noxidation behavior. In fact, C100 sample oxidizes through the formation of a protective \n\nmixture of oxides based on B / Si over a Ni-based oxide layer [10]. Although these oxides are \n\nprotective in static oxidation conditions, B-oxide melts below 600 \u00baC [21, 22], which leads to \n\nits easy removal hindering the formation of a stable oxide layer over the surface. As the \n\nprocess requires some time, since temperatures are still low being oxidation rates reduced \n\n[10], the destruction of the growing oxide layers is relatively easy and the formation of a \n\ntransfer layer is limited due to the dragging effect caused by the ball sliding and melted B-\n\noxide. Therefore, high wear volumes are expected and indeed the steep increase in the wear \n\nrate can be noticed in Fig. 3. In the case of C140 sample, besides Ni-based oxides, iron oxide \n\nis also formed during oxidation at these temperatures [10]. The oxidation rates are much \n\nhigher compared to C100 sample due to higher dilution. Therefore, a higher amount of oxide \n\ndebris can be produced facilitating the formation of a continuous oxide transfer layer. The \n\nsurface is thus protected quickly and, in spite of the much higher wear rate in comparison to \n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n\nC\n\nb)\n\nd)\n\nc)\n\na)\n\nFe\n2\nO\n\n3\nNiO\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\nv\ne\n i\nn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\nRaman shift [cm\n-1\n]\n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n137 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nRT test, the wear resistance is higher than that for C100 sample. Raman analysis performed at \n\nthe adhesive wear debris on C100 coating indicated that they were mainly Ni-O, although, \n\naccording to the EDS analysis, Fe-O, Si-O and Al-O should also coexist in much less amount. \n\nIt is in good agreement to our previous work on the oxidation behavior of this coating [10]. At \n\nthe clean zone (bottom part) of the worn surface EDS showed non-oxidized coating material. \n\nFor C140 coating, Raman analysis showed similar oxides but, in this case, a significant \n\namount of iron oxides (hematite and magnetite (Fe3O4)) were also detected, in good \n\nagreement to higher level of dilution and to the oxidation studies where this oxide was found \n\nto be the main constituent of the oxide scale [10]. Additionally, strong signals of C-based \n\nphases were detected by EDS. \n\nGray cast iron was fully covered with an oxide layer at this temperature, with \n\nscratches parallel to the movement of the sliding. The main oxides identified in the wear track \n\nwere hematite and magnetite (see Raman spectrum c) of Figure 8). The softening of the \n\nmaterial, induced by the temperature increase, together with the total depletion of graphite \n\nfrom the track surface justify the sharp increase in the wear rate, as well as the increase in the  \n\nfriction coefficient in comparison to results at RT. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n138 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - SEM morphology in secondary and backscattered electrons of worn surface of: a-b) C100 coating, c-\n\nd) 140 coating, e-f) cast iron; all tested at 550 \u00baC. \n\n \n\nWear\n\ndebris\n\na)\n\nc)\n\ne)\n\nd)\n\nf)\n\nb)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n139 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Raman spectra performed on the worn surface of: a) C100 coating tested at 550 \u00baC, b) C140 coating \n\ntested at 550 \u00baC, c) gray cast iron tested at 550 \u00baC. \n\nAt 700 \u00baC the oxidation rate of Ni-based coatings increased significantly allowing \n\nrapid and easy formation of a continuous oxide layer on the worn surfaces (see Fig. 9). The \n\noxide acts as a protective layer decreasing the wear loss of coatings. As the major wear \n\nvolume loss is produced during the formation of the protective oxide layer, faster production \n\nof tribolayer decreased the wear rate in relation to 550 \u00baC testing (see Fig. 3). Similar results \n\nwere achieved and in detail explained by Kesavan et al. [15]. Furthermore, since the oxidation \n\nrate of C140 coating is higher than that of C100 coating, the latter will take more time to form \n\nthe oxide layer generating a higher coating wear volume in the initial stage of the wear \n\nprocess. As a consequence, total wear rate after the test will be higher as well. Raman analysis \n\nof the wear tracks of both coatings showed the presence of Ni-O (see spectra a) and b) of Fig. \n\n10); moreover, iron oxides were identified in C140 coating. \n\nOn the other hand, gray cast iron oxidizes easily but the oxide does not support the \n\nsliding process and does not protect efficiently the base material. The increase in the \n\ntemperature promotes a severe softening of the material and a high oxidation rate leading to a \n\nstrong abrasion and, therefore, a very high wear loss. Raman analysis confirms the extensive \n\nformation of hematite in the wear track (spectra c of Fig. 10); signs of magnetite were also \n\ndetected. \n\nIn summary, although dilution reduces the hardness of coatings, it has beneficial effect \n\nat high temperature tribological behavior due to the faster formation of an oxide layers (owing \n\nto its less oxidation resistance) which protect the coating surface against wear. \n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n\nFe\n3\nO\n\n4\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\na)\n\nFe\n2\nO\n\n3\nNiO\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\nv\ne\n i\nn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\nRaman shift [cm\n-1\n]\n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n140 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 9 - SEM morphology in secondary and backscattered electrons of worn surface of: a-b) C100 \ncoating, c-d) 140 coating, e-f) cast iron; all tested at 700 \u00baC. \n\na)\n\nc)\n\ne)\n\nd)\n\nf)\n\nb)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n141 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Raman spectra performed on the worn surface of: a) C100 coating tested at 700 \u00baC, b) C140 coating \n\ntested at 700 \u00baC, c) gray cast iron tested at 700 \u00baC. \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nNickel based hardfaced coating deposited by plasma transferred arc on gray cast iron \n\nwith two dissimilar levels of dilution, were tribologically tested at room and high \n\ntemperatures and compared to uncoated gray iron. The results showed that the wear loss of \n\nthe coatings was independent of the substrate dilution at room temperature; tribo-oxidation \n\nwas the main wear mechanism. Despite its lower hardness, gray cast iron showed similar wear \n\nrate as Ni-based coatings due to the lubricious effect of a C tribo-layer formed on the sliding \n\nsurfaces. Increase sliding test temperature to 550 \u00baC led to an abrupt increase of the wear rate \n\nof the coatings and the gray cast iron due to the material softening and oxidation. Gray cast \n\niron showed extremely high wear values due to the continuous removal of the oxides, which \n\nexposed the soft non-oxidized material. Ni-O based layer protected more efficiently the Ni-\n\nbased coatings. Further increase in test temperature to 700 \u00baC led to the improvement of the \n\nwear resistance of coatings and an intensification of the wear on gray cast iron. The coating \n\nproduced with the highest dilution displayed the highest wear resistance at elevated \n\ntemperatures. This behavior was related to its lower oxidation resistance, which promoted the \n\neasier formation of high amounts of oxide wear debris and their agglomeration into compact \n\noxide tribolayer acting as protection of wearing surfaces. \n\n \n\n \n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n\nFe\n3\nO\n\n4\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\na)\n\nFe\n2\nO\n\n3\nNiO\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\nv\ne\n i\nn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\nRaman shift [cm\n-1\n]\n\n\n\nAnnex E \n\n142 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nThis research is sponsored by FEDER funds through the program COMPETE \u2013 Programa \n\nOperacional Factores de Competitividade \u2013 and by national funds through FCT \u2013 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npara a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia \u2013, under the projects PTDC/EME-TME/122116/2010, PEst-\n\nC/EME/UI0285/2013 and CENTRO -07-0224 -FEDER -002001 (MT4MOBI), as well as the \n\ngrant (SFRH/BD/68740/2010). \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n[1] Cingi M, Arisoy F, Basman G, Sesen K.

Two different procedures\nwere tested: (i) spraying powders of Colmonoy 88 and zirconia mixed by mechanical alloying and (ii)\nspraying powders separately using a dual powder injection system available at the APS equipment. The\nmicrostructure and the mechanical properties of coatings were characterized by scanning electron\nmicroscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-hardness\nmeasurements. The tribological properties were evaluated at room temperature in reciprocating sliding\nwear equipment. The results indicate that the as-sprayed modified coatings were mainly composed by\nNi, Ni\u2013Cr\u2013Fe, Cr23C6, Cr5B3, and tetragonal zirconia. Evenly distribution of zirconia can be seen in the\ncoatings produced by powders prepared by mechanical alloying, while dispersive ones can be seen in the\nother case.

The base material provides the overall mechanical\nstrength of the components while coatings provide a way of\nextending the limits of their use at the upper end of their\nperformance capabilities.\n\nA wide variety of coating materials such as cobalt, iron and\nnickel alloys can be successfully applied by thermal spraying\ntechnologies to protect the surface of components subjected to\nharsh environments [4\u20136]. Superalloys and cermet APS (atmo-\nspheric plasma spraying) coatings have been widely employed to\nimprove the oxidation, corrosion, abrasion and wear resistance of\nengineering components, such as plungers, molds, wearing plats,\nturbines, tools, etc, whose surface is submitted to extreme tribo-\nlogical conditions in service [7\u201310]. Nickel-based alloys have been\nespecially used in the protection of parts due to their unique\ncombination of properties (mechanical, tribological, and high\ntemperature properties) [11\u201314]. The microstructure and the wear\nll rights reserved.\n\n: +351 239 790 701.\nnandes).\nbehavior of cobalt, iron and nickel alloys coatings have been\nstudied using several alloy compositions, several processes of\ndeposition and different substrates. Regarding the wear resistance\nof these coatings, some special composite systems were studied\nand developed. The incorporation of hard and stable carbides and\noxide phases, such as CrC, SiC, WC, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, etc, in\nthese coatings, has been reported as a way to improve their wear\nresistance. For example, Hou et al. [15] showed the beneficial\neffect of nano-Al2O3 particles on the microstructure and wear\nresistance of a nickel-based alloy coating deposited by plasma\ntransferred arc (PTA). Harsha et al. [1] studied the influence of CrC\non the microstructure, microhardness and wear resistance of a\nnickel-based alloy deposited by flame spraying process. They\nobserved that the wear resistance of the Ni modified coating is\nincreased relatively to the CrC-free Ni-based alloy. Wang et al. [16]\ninvestigated the effect of three nano-particles additions (Al2O3,\nSiC, CeO2) on the high temperature wear behavior of a Ni-based\nalloy coatings produced by laser cladding technique and reported\nthat the addition of these nanoparticles increased the wear\nresistance of the coatings. Regarding the effect of incorporation\nof ZrO2 particles in a Ni matrix, it has also been extensively studied\n[17\u201320]; however, only electrodeposited coatings have been con-\ncerned.

Experimental procedure\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nIn this investigation commercial powders of a Ni-based alloy\n(Colmonoy 88) and nanostructured zirconia from the \u201cWall Colmonoy\u201d\nand \u201cInnovnano\u201d companies, respectively, were used as feedstock to\nproduce coatings with Atmospheric Plasma Spraying process (APS)\nonto a low carbon steel substrate (AISI 8620). The Ni-based alloy\npowders have been characterized as a spherical morphology with an\naverage size D50 of 45 mm and density of 7900 (kg/m3), whilst\nnanostructured ZrO2 powders have an average primary particle size\nof 60 nm with granule size D50 of 60 mm and density 1700 (kg/m3).\nThe chemical compositions of the as-received powders are displayed\nin Table 1. The plasma sprayed coatings were deposited with an APS\nA3000 system from \u201cSulzer Metco\u201d, using either pure as-received\npowders and a dual system for powder injection available at the\nAPS equipment (designated as \u201cDual\u201d) or mixtures of powders\nprepared by mechanical alloying (MA) process (designated as \u201cMA\u201d).\nThe substrate material was grit-blasted with alumina grade 24 from\n\u201cAlodur Germany\u201d before coating (which induced a corresponding\nsuperficial roughness (Ra) of 5 mm), to increase the surface roughness\nand achieve the proper mechanical interlocking between the coating\nand the substrate. For pure colmonoy and zirconia coatings and Dual\nprocedure, the substrates were fixed positioned, being the spraying of\nthe surface ensured by the movement of the torch. On the other hand,\nFig. 2. X-ray diffraction pattern of the dissimilar powders used in the depositions.\n\nFig. 3. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDS) of a powde\nin the MA method the substrates were placed in a rotatory table and\nthe spraying was performed by combining this rotation with the\nvertical movement of the torch. Before final depositions, preliminary\ncoatings were produced changing the main deposition parameters\nand, then, characterized in order to properly select the depositions\nconditions that allowed achieving the best results. Moreover, during\ndepositions the substrates were cooled down by two pressurized air\nguns keeping the temperature below 150 1C, in order to avoid cracking\nand residual stresses formation.\n\nPowders mixtures were prepared by mechanical alloying in a\nFritsch planetary ball mill using a 250 ml hardened steel vial and\nfifteen balls with 20 mm diameter of the same material. Two propor-\ntions of nanostructured zirconia were added to the nickel-based alloy\npowder, 20% and 40% in volume, i.e. 5.1 and 12.5 gr of nanostructured\nZrO2 powder for 94.9 and 87.4 gr of nickel-based alloy powder,\nrespectively. The MA process was carried out at 400 rpm for 2 h in a\nprotective atmosphere of argon. After 1 h of milling, the process was\ninterrupted for 10 min to cool the vial and to reserve rotation. Finally,\nafter milling, the powder was mechanical sieved to obtain particles\nwith a size distribution in the range [28\u201371 mm]. Two different\ncoatings also containing nanostructured zirconia additions of 20%\nand 40% were also performed by using the dual system of powder\ninjection available at the APS equipment. In this case the proportion\nwas easily achieved by controlling the flow of powders through the\nrotation control of the powder feeders. Henceforth, coatings produced\nusing as received pure powder of nickel-based alloy and nanostruc-\ntured zirconia will be designated as \u201cNi\u201d, and \u201cZrO2\u201d, respectively,\ncoatings produced with powders prepared by mechanical alloying\nusing 20% and 40% of nanostructured ZrO2 will be termed as \u201cNi+20%\nMA\u201d and \u201cNi+40% MA\u201d, respectively, and coatings deposited using the\ndual system of powder injection with 20% and 40% of nanostructured\nZrO2 will be designated as \u201cNi+20% Dual\u201d and \u201cNi+40% Dual\u201d,\nrespectively. The process parameters employed in the dissimilar\ncoating depositions are shown in Table 2.\n2.2. Powders and coatings characterization\n\nPowders morphology were observed and characterized by scan-\nning electron microscopy with X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) using Co K? radiation. Transverse section\nof APS coatings was polished using conventional metallographic\nprocedure which consisted grinding followed by polishing. The\nmicrostructure of coatings was studied and characterized by optical\nmicroscope (OM) and SEM/EDS. Further, the structure of the coatings\nwas studied by X-ray diffraction. The micro-hardness of coatings was\ndetermined by Vickers testing using a 3 N load at 15 s holding time. A\ntotal of 30 measurements of hardness were done in each coating.\nr produced by mechanical alloying (condition Ni+40% ZrO2).\n\n\n\nF. Fernandes et al. / Wear 303 (2013) 591\u2013601594\n2.3. Wear tests\n\nWear behavior of APS coatings was studied using reciprocating\nwear equipment. An harmonic wave generated by an eccentric and\nrod mechanism imposed a stroke length of 2.05 mm at a frequency\nof 1 Hz. A detailed description of the equipment can be found in\nreference [21]. Before wear tests, the surface of coatings were\ngrounded and then polished using a 3 mm diamond past. A superficial\nroughness Ra of: 0.51, 0.65, 0.49 and 0.98 mm was measured\nrespectively for Ni, Ni Dual, Ni MA and ZrO2 coatings. In the scope\nof the present study, the values of normal load applied to the coated\nsamples were 5, 7, 8.5 and 10 N. All the tests were conducted at a\nconstant rotational speed of 190 rpm during 2 h. The acquisition time\nFig. 4. SEM morphology of the: (a) Ni-based alloy coating, (b) nanostructured ZrO2 coat\nand Ni+40% MA.\nof signal used was 60 s. A soda-lime glass sphere with 500 HV0.5 of\nhardness and 10 mm in diameter was used as counterpart, in order\nto study the interaction of glass with the different coatings. After\nwear tests, the volume loss was estimated through the transverse\nprofile of each wear scar at the middle and near the end of both sides\nof the scar. To ensure the reproducibility of results, a set of three scars\nfor each test condition was performed at the coating, and the volume\nloss calculated by using the volume average of these marks. An\napproach of the Archard's law was applied; see Eq. (1), in order to\nobtain the specific wear rate. In this equation, V represents the wear\nvolume, P is the normal load, k is the specific wear rate and l the\nsliding distance.

As the EDS spectra displays, the powder\nis essentially formed by nickel, zirconia, oxygen and tungsten,\nsupporting the results from the XRD analysis.\n\n3.2. Microstructure\n\nFig. 4 shows SEM micrographs of the cross section of the\ncoatings. All coatings present the typical morphology of plasma\nspraying, with pores, lamellae, partially melted and un-melted\nparticles and good adhesion to the substrate. ZrO2 (see Fig. 4b) and\nNi+ZrO2 Dual coatings (Fig. 4(c and d)) show a higher level of\nporosity than the other coatings. Very often, small pores were\nfound within the flattened particles and result from shrinkage\nporosity and big pores were normally located between lamellae\nand were caused by gas porosity phenomenon [24]. In all cases the\nmelting states of particles influence the level of porosity and,\nusually, low melting state of particles gives rise to a porous\nmicrostructure. Furthermore, pure ZrO2 coating, (see Fig. 4b)\nreveals the presence of some cracks in the coating, resulting from\ntensile residual stresses generated during cooling down to room\ntemperature. Ni and MA coatings (see Fig. 4(a), (e) and (f)) display\na compact and homogenous structure, while Dual coatings\nrevealed a microstructure full of semi-melted particles, suggesting\na brittle character based on low level of agglomeration between\nparticles. It is well known that in the thermal spraying processes\nthe melting level depends on the thermal energy added to the\nparticles, on the plasma temperature and on the particles flying\ntime. During plasma spraying, molten particles impact the surface\n\n\n\nF. Fernandes et al. / Wear 303 (2013) 591\u2013601 597\nof substrate, then deform, solidify and transform into lamellae.\nDuring spraying, the particles can be in all of the following\nstates on impact: fully molten, superheated, semi-molten and\nmolten then re-solidified [24,25], depending on the deposition\nparameters. It is well known that in plasma spraying the electric\narc current, the primary plasma gas flow rate, the second plasma\ngas flow rate and powder size are the main parameters that\ninfluence the in-flight particle behaviors. From Table 2, comparing\nthe process parameters for the Ni and Ni+20% and 40% ZrO2 Dual\ncoatings, differences can be observed in relation to the spray\ndistance, primary and secondary gas flow rates, and powder feed\nrate. According to the literature, an increase of argon flow rate\nleads to a gentle decrease of particle temperature but a rapid\nincrease of velocity [26]. On the other hand, increasing the\nhydrogen flow rate increases both, temperature and velocity,\nthough temperature is more sensitive to the hydrogen flow rate\nthan velocity. So, due to the lower primary gas flow rate (Ar) and\nhigher secondary gas flow rate (H2) used in the Ni +ZrO2 Dual\ncoatings, would be expected a great level of melting particles and\nconsequently an homogenous structure, if the particles do not\noxidize during the in-flight time. However, such fact was not\nobserved. The lower primary gas flow rate (Ar) used in the\nproduction of these coatings might suggest that independently\nof the high melting state of particles, the velocity given by the flow\ncould be not enough to accelerate the particles onto the specimen\nsurface. Nevertheless, the same process parameters were used in\nthe deposition of the Ni+20% MA coating, with exception of the\nspraying distance, and the microstructure revealed to be homo-\ngenous and compact. In fact, the spraying distance also plays an\nimportant role in the thermal treatment of particles during their\nin-flight time [27]. Thereby, for short spraying distances, due to\nthe short exposure of particles in the flame, the energy added by\nthe flame could be not enough to semi-molten or molten the\nparticles, giving rise to a microstructure similar to those observed\nfor these coatings. Furthermore, it can also be speculated that the\ntwo different ways to add zirconia at the nickel alloy can change\nthe entropy of the system, and therefore change the running-on of\nFig. 10. Variation of the friction force of coatings with applied load for: (a) Ni coating,\nthe deposition. In fact, according to the literature the nature of\npowders has a detrimental effect in their interaction with the\nplasma spraying flame and, therefore, on the properties of the\ncoatings [28]. The low level of melting particles can also explain\nthe high level of porosity observed in these coatings.\n\nFor better characterization and perception of the different\ncoatings microstructure, magnifications of the Ni, Ni+40% Dual\nand Ni+40% MA coatings, as well as EDS analyses are shown in\nFig. 5. The EDS analysis revealed that Ni coating is essentially\nformed by Ni, W, Cr and Fe, which matches well with the chemical\ncomposition of the as received Ni powders. Moreover, small\nparticles rich in W (white phase) can be observed evenly dis-\ntributed in the microstructure. The semi-melted particles in the\nmicrostructure of the Ni+40% Dual coating are from the same\nnature of the Ni coating matrix, therefore, they can be identified as\nsemi-melted Colmonoy powders. Similar to Ni coating a white\nphase rich in W is also detected in the microstructure, co-existing\nwith a coarse gray phase, entrapped between the boundaries of\nthe semi-melted particles, revealed by EDS to be zirconia. Such a\ndistribution is in the basis of a brittle behavior. Contrary to this\ncoating, Ni+40% MA displays a compact and homogeneous micro-\nstructure, with small zirconia particles evenly distributed along\nthe microstructure improving the coating toughness. Therefore,\nfrom these results, it can be inferred that the addition of nano-\nstructured zirconia can be successfully achieved by using both\nprocedures, powders prepared by mechanical alloying or dual\nprojection. However, in coatings deposited with MA powders\nzirconia is finer and more homogeneously distributed in the\nNi-matrix giving rise to better mechanical performance.\n\nXRD patterns of the coatings are displayed in Fig. 6. As the\nspectrum reveals, the nickel-based coating consists mainly of Ni,\nNi-Cr-Fe, Cr23C6 and Cr5B3 phases. These results are in accordance\nwith the literature where similar phases were identified [23].\nMoreover, all the coatings with nanostructured zirconia additions\nshowed diffraction lines corresponding to the same phases identi-\nfied at both the Ni and ZrO2 coatings. In the latter, is mainly\nformed by tetragonal zirconia.\n(b) Ni+40% Dual coating, (c) Ni+40% MA coating (d) nanostructured ZrO2 coating.\n\n\n\nF. Fernandes et al. / Wear 303 (2013) 591\u2013601598\n3.3. Micro-hardness\n\nFig. 7 shows that nanostructured ZrO2 additions increases the\nhardness of the nickel-based alloy. The same behavior was reported\nby other authors after addition of hard particles such as (Al2O3, CeO2,\nSiC, WC) at a nickel alloy [1,3,16]. However, MA coatings have higher\nhardness than Dual ones. This result is coherent with either the\nlower porosity or the finer and more homogeneous distribution of\nnanostructured zirconia in Ni+ZrO2 MA coatings.\n\n3.4. Wear behavior\n\nThe volume loss due to wear of the coatings and counterpart\nincreases with increasing applied load, as it is shown in Fig. 8(a) and\n(b), respectively, being this trend more notorious for ZrO2 coating. As it\nwill be shown later, the higher volume loss for this coating can be\ncorrelated with the brittle behavior as displayed on its worn surface.\nNanostructured zirconia additions have a positive effect, decreasing\nthe volume loss of material, independently of the deposition proce-\ndure used. However, efficiency seems to be higher in Ni+ZrO2 MA\ncoatings which display higher decreases of the volume loss than Ni\n+ZrO2 Dual coatings. Furthermore, increasing zirconia content in MA\ncoatings continues to have a beneficial effect whereas the inverse is\nobserved in Dual coatings. The better wear performance of Ni+ZrO2\nMA coatings can be attributed to the combination of a higher\nhardness, an evenly distribution of smaller zirconia domains in the\nNi-based matrix and a more compact microstructure. In fact, the\npresence of hard phases increases the overall hardness of the coating\nand, on the other hand, smaller and uniformly distributed hard\nFig. 11. SEM morphologies of the worn surfaces tested at 8.5 N load of the:\ndomains in a soft matrix gives rise to tougher materials, which\ncombined lead to a decrease of the volume loss due to wear. Similar\nbehavior was observed by other author after adding hard particles to a\nnickel based alloy [1,15]. In the case of Ni+ZrO2 Dual coatings\nnanostructured hard ZrO2 phases have initially a similar influence,\nby increasing the hardness. However, the agglomeration of ZrO2\nparticles, localized in-between Ni-based lamellae makes microstruc-\nture less tough with its consequent detrimental effect on the wear\nperformance when high contents of the hard phase exist.\n\nIn order to normalize the wear results, they were plotted in Fig. 9\nin terms of material volume loss as function of the product of sliding\ndistance by the applied load. For each set of data, a straight linear\ntrend was fitted in order to obtain the specific wear rate from the\nslope (see Eq. 1). Further, a complete reliability analysis of the specific\nwear rate is presented in Table 3 for a confidence interval of 90%.\nBecause of the high volume loss displayed by the ZrO2 coating, only\nthe point produced with lower load and the beginning of the straight\nadjustment were plotted in Fig. 9. Crossing the information of Fig. 9\nand Table 3 it is possible conclude the specific wear rate of\nNi-modified coatings is lower than that of the un-modified Ni coating.\nNi+40% ZrO2 dual coating display the lowest specific wear rate, being\nthis result attributed to the higher hardness displayed by this coating.\nFurther, coatings produced by the dual system of powder injection\ndisplay higher specific wear rate than coatings produced by powders\nprepared by mechanical alloying. ZrO2 coating displays the highest\nspecific wear rate, being one and two orders of magnitude greater\nthan the un-modified and modified coatings, respectively.\n\nThe average values of the frictional force of the Ni, Ni+40% Dual,\nNi+40% MA and ZrO2 coatings linearly increases with the applied\n(a) Ni coating, (b) Ni+40% dual, (c) Ni+40% MA, (d) ZrO2 coating.\n\n\n\nF.

The changes in the specific wear rate and friction\ncoefficient described above are only partially correlated with the\napplied test conditions and properties of the materials, which can\nproduce dissimilar wear mechanisms during wear tests, and there-\nfore dissimilar volume loss of coatings. These reasons have encour-\naged the investigation of the interaction between the pair\nspecimens-counterpart. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ana-\nlysis was conducted on the dissimilar worn surfaces of coatings in\norder to identify the main wear mechanisms produced.\n\nTypical SEM morphologies of worn surfaces of the coatings\ntested with 8.5 N against a glass sphere are shown in Fig. 11.\nDistinct wear mechanisms were identified in the worn surfaces. In\nNi and Ni+ZrO2 Dual coatings significant amount of adherent\nmaterial is shown in the wear scar, while Ni+ZrO2 MA and ZrO2\ncoatings show clean worn surfaces. EDS analysis performed in\nadhered debris, marked in Fig. 12(a) and (b) by letters A and B,\nallows concluding that they are made of silicon oxides and Ni,\nsuggesting a mechanical mixing by the friction process, joining the\nsofter Ni phase with the silica type wear debris from the ball wear.\nBeing softer, the compact wear debris can stick at the worn track\nas well as at the ball wear scar, as can be observed in Fig. 13.\nDuring contact the friction generated by the movement of the\ncounterpart against the surface specimen, causes an increase of\ntemperature promoting local plastic deformation. At this time,\nboth materials will adhere to each other. In the wear track of the\nNi coating, see Fig. 12(a), the wear debris tend to be incorporated\nin the specimens, more precisely in the boundaries of the semi-\nmelted powders, remaining adherent and leading to removal of\nmaterial. This mechanism explains simultaneously the high fric-\ntion values reported for Ni coating. On the other hand, ZrO2\ncoating shows clean wear scars without traces of adhered material.\nThe surface has a brittle appearance, where micro cracks can be\nseen, as shown in Fig. 12(d), revealing a rough surface from which\nparticles of several tens of micrometers were detached. This\nmorphology suggests mechanical interlocking during the contact\nwhich can explain the higher values of the friction coefficient.\nFurthermore, it should promote a strong abrasion in the counter-\npart, giving rise to much higher wear rate as shown in Fig. 8(b).\nMoreover, the evolution of the wear amount with the increase of\nnormal load, (see Fig. 8), allow identifying a made severe wear\nvolume for loads higher than 7 N, which should be correlated to a\ntransition for a made brittle behavior. Similar behavior was\nobserved by Chen et al. [29] during the evaluation of\nun-lubricated wear properties of plasma-sprayed nanostructures\nand conventional zirconia coatings. The wear scars of Ni+ZrO2\nFig. 13. Optical micrograph of the ball wear scars tested against the Ni coating with\n7 N of load.\nDual coatings show a mix morphology of pure Ni and ZrO2\ncoatings, i.e. adhered debris can be observed over a rough\nbrittle-appearance surface, whose number decreases with nanos-\ntructured zirconia additions. In these coatings, zirconia particles\nare localized in the boundaries of the semi-melted Ni-based\npowders (see Fig. 4c and d). Despite of the particles operating as\nreinforcement of the coatings, leading to a lower volume loss, the\narea of the nickel exposed to the glass sphere remains higher.\nTherefore, it is expected similar debris adhesion as for Ni coating.\nAt the same time, due to the continuous removal of material, ZrO2\nparticles in the boundaries of the semi-melted powders loses their\nsupport capacity being removed from the boundaries. These\nparticles will slide through the wear track acting as a removal of\nthe wear debris. Increasing the volume of nanostructured zirconia\nfrom 20 to 40%, higher levels of brittleness in the boundaries are\nachieved, increasing the volume loss of material, as reported\nbefore, and giving rise to the rough and brittle appearance shown\nbelow the adhered debris. The higher level of porosity of these\ncoatings also accounts for higher levels of volume loss of material.\n\nThe coatings produced from MA powders show also clean wear\nsurfaces but with a different failure type from pure zirconia coating. Ni\n+ZrO2 MA coatings reveal surfaces with scratches identifying some\nsort of grooving abrasion, see Fig. 12(c). The uniform distribution of\nsmall nanostructured zirconia particles and the higher hardness and\ntoughness of these coatings avoids the plastic deformation, the\nadhesion and the liberation of large wear debris either from the\ncoating or the counterpart. The smooth worn surfaces can be in the\nbasis of the low friction coefficient [30]. In these coatings, the matrix\ncutting occurs through a process of two body abrasion, as shown\nFig. 12(c). Despite of the dissimilar wear mechanisms observed in the\nwear track of the coatings, during the wear tests it was observed that\nmost of the material resulting from the wear was blown out, due to\nthe movement of the ball.\n4. Conclusions\n?\n The influence of nanostructured zirconia additions on the\nmicrostructure, micro-hardness and wear performance of a\nnickel-based hardfacing alloy deposited by atmospheric\nplasma spraying (APS) on low carbon steel is reported in the\npresent paper.\n?\n The coatings containing nanostructured zirconia additions\nwere produced either using powders prepared by mechanical\nalloying or using separate powders that are sprayed simulta-\nneously via a dual system of powder injection.\n?\n Nanostructured zirconia can be successfully incorporated into\nnickel-based alloy powders by mechanical alloying. Coatings\nproduced with these powders present evenly distributed zir-\nconia as opposed to coatings produced by separate powder\ninjection, where the nanostructured zirconia particles were\nentrapped in the boundaries of the semi-melted Ni lamellae.\n?\n The microstructure of the nickel coating consists mainly of Ni,\nNi\u2013Cr\u2013Fe, Cr23C6 and Cr5B3 phases. The same diffraction lines\nwere identified in the modified nickel coatings with tetragonal\nzirconia, independently of the procedure used in depositions.\n?\n The hardness and wear behavior of coatings was improved\nwith nanostructured zirconia additions while the friction\ncoefficient is decreased.\n?\n The nanostructured ZrO2 coating shows the highest hardness\nvalues but also the highest specific wear rate, one to two orders\nof magnitude higher than the other prepared coatings, in\nparticular those deposited with MA powders.\n?\n Adhesive wear mechanism was observed in the worn surface of\nthe nickel coating and coatings prepared by Dual deposition,\n\n\n\nF.

The  aim  of  this  investigation  was  to  study\nthe effect of  V  additions  on  the  structure,  mechanical  properties  and  oxidation  resistance  of  Ti\u2013Si\u2013V\u2013N\ncoatings  deposited  by  DC  reactive  magnetron  sputtering.  The  results  achieved  for TiSiVN  films  were com-\npared  and  discussed  in  relation  to TiN  and  TiSiN  films  prepared  as  reference.  All  coatings  presented  a  fcc\nNaCl-type  structure.  A  shift  of  the  diffraction  peaks  to higher  angles  with  increasing  Si  and  V  contents\nsuggested  the  formation  of  a  substitutional  solid  solution  in  TiN  phase.  Hardness  and  Young\u2019s  modulus\nof the  coatings  were  similar  regardless  on V  content.  The  onset  of  oxidation  of the  films  decreased  sig-\nnificantly  to 500 ?C when  V  was added  into  the  films;  this  behaviour  was  independent  of  the Si  and  V\nxidation resistance\nanadium oxide\n\ncontents. The  thermogravimetric  isothermal  curves  of  TiSiVN  coatings  oxidized  at  temperatures  below\nthe melting  point  of  ?-V2O5 (?685 ?C)  showed  two  stages:  at an  early  stage,  the  weight  increase  over\ntime  is  linear,  whilst,  in  the second  stage,  a parabolic  evolution  can  be fitted  to  the  experimental  data.  At\nhigher  temperatures  only  a  parabolic  evolution  was  fitted.  ?-V2O5 was  the  main  phase  detected  at  the\noxidized  surface  of  the coatings.  Reduction  of  ?-V2O5 to  ?-V2O5 phase  occurred  for  temperatures  above\n\nits melting  point.\n\n. Introduction\n\nHigh-speed cutting and dry machining processes without the\nse of environmental harmful lubrication requires milling tools\napable to withstand severe conditions of wear, friction, oxidation\nnd corrosion [1,2]. Solid lubricants coatings, such as WC/C, MoS2,\niamond-like carbon (DLC), hex-BN as well as their combinations\n\nn nanocrystaline or multilayer structures, have been successfully\npplied in such parts in order to increase their lifetime and perfor-\nance for various tribological applications. However, considerable\n\negradation of the tribological effectiveness of these coatings at ele-\nated temperature has been reported due to their low resistance to\nxidation [3\u20135]. To overcome this shortcoming, a new concept of\nubrication based on the formation of lubricious oxides has been\n\nroposed. This is the case of the so-called Magn\u00e9li oxide phases\nased on Ti, Si, Mo,  W and V, which have easy shear able planes\n3,6]. Among these elements, particular attention has been given\n\n?

Dissimilar series of V-based hard\ncoatings have been developed, such as ternary CrVN [13], (V,Ti)N\n[14], multilayer AlN/VN [15] and quaternary single layer or mul-\ntilayered CrAlVN [16,17] and TiAlVN [2,8,18,19]. However, since\nother ternary coatings systems, based on (TiX)N with X = B, Cr, Al,\nSi, Cr, etc, have been attractive for advanced hard coating materi-\nals, the effect of vanadium doping to these systems should also be\nconsidered.\n\nAmong those ternary systems, most of the research works have\nbeen focused on TiSiN coatings deposited by CVD and/or PVD tech-\nniques [20,21]. Depending on the deposition conditions, these coat-\nings could be deposited with a nanocomposite structure, consisting\nof nano-sized TiN crystallites surrounded by an amorphous matrix\nof Si3N4 displaying very high hardness values [22], compared to any\nother ternary (TiX)N compound, with extremely good oxidation\nresistance [23,24]. In other deposition conditions, substitutional\n\nsolid solution of Si in TiN structure (not predicted by the Ti\u2013Si\u2013N\nphase diagram) could be achieved [22,25,26]. Relatively to the\nfriction coefficient of Ti\u2013Si\u2013N coatings, the studies have reported\nvalues in the range [0.6\u20131.3] at room and high temperatures\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.10.117\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01694332\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/apsusc\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.10.117&amp;domain=pdf\nmailto:filipe.fernandes@dem.uc.pt\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.10.117\n\n\nF.

Since the addition of V successfully decreased the friction\noefficient of binary and ternary systems (down to reported values\nf 0.2\u20130.3 at temperatures between 550 and 700 ?C), similar studies\nn the effect of V-addition should be performed on TiSiN coatings\nxhibiting unique mechanical properties and oxidation resistance.\n\nThis paper reports the first results on the effect of increasing\nanadium content to Ti\u2013Si\u2013V\u2013N films deposited by DC reactive\nagnetron sputtering. It is focused on coating structure, mechan-\n\ncal properties and oxidation resistance. Comparison of the results\nith those achieved for reference TiN and TiSiN coatings is pre-\n\nented. The results of this study will support further research aimed\nt the tribological behaviour of the coatings at high temperatures.\n\n. Experimental procedure\n\nThree series of TiSiN films with different Si contents, each\neries with increasing V contents (TiSiVN coatings), were deposited\nn a d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering machine equipped with\nwo rectangular (100 \u00d7 200 mm)  magnetron cathodes working in\nnbalanced mode. A high purity Ti (99.9%) target, with 18 holes of\n0 mm in diameter (uniformly distributed throughout the prefer-\nntial erosion zone of the target), and a high purity TiSi2 (99.9%)\nomposite target were used in the depositions. The different sili-\non contents were achieved by changing the power density applied\no each target. The V content was varied by changing the number\nf high purity rods of Ti and V (with 10 mm in diameter) placed in\nhe holes of the Ti target. 4, 8 and 12 cylindrical pieces of vanadium\nere used. In all the cases the total power applied to the targets was\n\net to 1500 W.  To serve as reference, a stoichiometric TiN coating\nas deposited from the Ti target. Hereinafter the coatings will be\nesignated as Sx-y, where x is related to the specific power applied\no the TiSi2 target (see Table 1), and therefore associated to the\ni content on the coatings, and y the number of V rods used in\nhe depositions, giving an indication of V content in each series of\niSiVN films. Thus, denomination S2-0, S2-4, S2-8 and S2-12 rep-\nesents coatings from the same series, i.e. with identical Si content\nTiSi2 target power 1.5 W/cm2), with increasing V content from 0\np to a maximum content achieved for the coating produced using\n2 vanadium pellets embedded into the Ti target.\n\nPolished high-speed steel (AISI M2)  (\u00d8 20 \u00d7 3 mm,  for mechani-\nal properties measurements), FeCrAl alloy and alumina substrates\n\n10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 1 mm,  for oxidation tests and structural analysis), stain-\ness steel discs (\u00d8 20 \u00d7 1 mm,  for residual stress measurements)\nnd (1 1 1) silicon samples (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 0.8 mm,  for thickness mea-\nurements and chemical composition evaluation) were used as\n12\n73 \u2013\n\nsubstrates. Prior to the depositions, all the substrates were ultra-\nsonically cleaned in acetone for 15 min  and alcohol for 10 min. The\nsubstrates were mounted in a substrate holder (which revolved\nwith 18 rev/min around the centre axis) giving a target to sub-\nstrate distance of 175 mm.  Prior to deposition, the chamber was\nevacuated down to 8.7 \u00d7 10?4 Pa and the substrates were etched\nwith Ar ion sputtering during 1 h with a bias voltage of ?650 V to\nremove any surface contaminants. In order to enhance the adhesion\nof the coatings, Ti and TiN adhesion layers of approximately 0.24\nand 0.45 ?m, respectively, were deposited on the substrates before\nTiSi(V)N coatings. In all the depositions, the total working gas pres-\nsure was kept constant at 0.3 Pa, using approximately 30 sccm of\nAr and 17 sccm of N2. The depositions were performed with a neg-\native substrate bias of 50 V. The deposition time was  set in order to\nobtain films with approximately 2.5 ?m of total thickness (includ-\ning interlayers). The deposition parameters are shown in Table 1.\n\nThe chemical composition of the coatings was  evaluated by\nelectron probe microanalysis (EPMA\u2014Cameca SX 50). Crystallo-\ngraphic structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction (X\u2019 Pert\nPro MPD  diffractometer) using a grazing incidence angle of 1? and\nCu K?1 radiation (? = 1.54060 A?). The XRD spectra were fitted by\nusing a pseudo-Voigt function to calculate either the full width\nat half maximum (FWHM) and the peak position (2?). The frac-\nture cross-section morphology and the thickness of the films were\ninvestigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Further, pro-\nfilometer was used to confirm coating thickness and to evaluate\nsurface roughness.\n\nThe hardness and Young\u2019s modulus of films were measured in\na nano-indentation equipment (Micro Materials NanoTest) using a\nBerkovich diamond pyramid indenter. In order to avoid the effect\nof the substrate, the applied load (10 mN)  was selected to keep\nthe indentation depth less than 10% of the coating\u2019 thickness. 32\nmeasurements were performed in each sample. The level of resid-\nual stresses was calculated through the Stoney equation [30] by\nmeasuring the bulk deflection of the film-substrate body.\n\nThe oxidation resistance of the coatings was evaluated by ther-\nmogravimetric analysis (TGA) using industrial air (99.99% purity).\nThe films deposited on alumina substrates were firstly heated with\na constant temperature ramp of 20 ?C/min from room temperature\nup to 1200 ?C, in order to determine the onset point of oxidation.\nThen, coated specimens of FeCrAl alloy were subjected to isother-\n\nmal  tests at different selected temperatures and time. The weight\ngain of the samples was  evaluated at regular 2 s intervals using a\nmicrobalance with an accuracy of 0.01 mg.  The air flux used was\n50 ml/min and the heating rate up to the isothermal temperature\n\n\n\n116 F.

Chemical composition and microstructure\nThe elemental chemical composition of the coatings determined\n\ny EPMA is shown in Table 2. As could be expected, the simulta-\neous decrease in the power density of Ti target and increase in the\nower density of TiSi2 target gave rise to higher Si content in the\noatings. Only insignificant variations were detected on the Si/Ti\natios with incorporation of V in the Ti target. The nitrogen content\nf the coatings was close to 50 at.% regardless of Si and V.\n\nThe corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-deposited\noatings are displayed in Fig. 1. The influence of increasing V con-\nent on TiSiN coatings is shown in Fig. 1b) for the film with lower\ni content, as representative of all series containing vanadium. In\nll graphs TiN film pattern is shown as a reference. In all cases, the\niffraction peaks could be generally assigned to the fcc NaCl-type\nrystalline TiN phase. The XRD pattern of the TiN reference coating\n\neveals that all peaks are shifted to lower diffraction angles in rela-\nion to the standard ICDD card of TiN, probably indicating residual\nompressive stresses [31]. For TiSiN coatings with 3.8 and 6.7 at.%\nf Si, (2 0 0) peak vanishes and the sharpening of the peaks suggests\n Science 289 (2014) 114\u2013 123\n\nlarger grain size. Based on Scherrer\u2019 equation, grain sizes of 16 and\n24 nm were calculated for TiN and coatings with low Si content,\nrespectively. With further increase of the Si content (12.6 at.% of\nSi) a strong decrease of the peaks intensity, as well as their signifi-\ncant broadening (a grain size of 6 nm was  calculated), are observed\nsuggesting a decrease of crystallinity. With increasing Si content,\nthe fcc peaks are shifted to higher angles, behaviour associated to\na smaller unit cell. This can be explained by the presence of Si in\nsolid solution, since its smaller atomic radius promotes the con-\ntraction of the TiN lattice. Therefore, in this case the stoichiometric\nphases (TiN + Si3N4) do not segregate and nanocomposite structure\nis not formed. Such behaviour could be explained by the low depo-\nsition temperature together with low substrate ion bombardment,\nwhich do not provide the necessary mobility of the species for the\nnanocomposite formation [22]. This observation is in agreement\nwith the results from the literature, where similar solid solutions\nand changes in the film orientation have been observed with silicon\nincorporation [21,25,32].\n\nThe coatings with V displayed similar XRD patterns and peaks\nto TiSiN. No significant changes in the peaks intensities or widths\nwere observed, except for the highest Si content films where a\nsmall improvement in the crystallinity was  detected. All the vana-\ndium containing films had the XRD peaks shifted to higher angles,\nbehaviour, once again, related to a smaller unit cell due to the sub-\nstitution of Ti by the smaller V atoms. Similar trend was  observed\nby Pfeiler et al. [2] for the TiAlVN system.\n\nFig. 2 displays typical surface and fracture cross section-\nmicrographs of TiSiVN coatings. All coatings showed a typical\ncolumnar structure. As Si content was increased (see Fig. 2b)) for\ncoating S1-0), the columns size and the surface roughness were\nfirstly reduced, for silicon contents of 3.8 and 6.7 at.%, and then\nincreased for the highest silicon content, which is an opposite\ntrend than that observed for the grain size. The addition of V did\nnot change the global type of columnar morphology and the coat-\ning cross-section was similar. The only exception was the strong\nincrease of the size of the columns as well as the surface roughness\n(see Fig. 2c) for coating S1-12) for low silicon content coatings.\n\n3.1.2. Hardness, Young\u2019s modulus and residual stresses\nThe dependence of the hardness and Young\u2019 modulus on the\n\nSi and V content is shown in Fig. 3. As the silicon content in the\nTiSiN films increases, the hardness of coatings reached a maximum\nvalue of 27 GPa at a Si content of 6.7 at%; then it dropped with fur-\nther increasing Si content to a lower value than the reference TiN.\nAlthough the grain grow is observed with increasing Si additions\nup to 6.7 at% of Si, the hardening of coatings is mostly result of the\nnitride lattice distortion, which improves the resistance to plastic\ndeformation (solid solution hardening). Residual stresses should\nnot be a factor of hardness differentiation between the coatings,\nsince all films have approximately the same level of compressive\nresidual stresses, with any Si addition (?3 GPa). This result also sup-\nports what was stated above that the shift of the peaks to the right\nwith Si additions is exclusively due to substitutional solid solu-\ntion. The decrease in hardness with further Si addition is due to\nthe loss of crystallinity associated with the lower degree of phase\nnitriding regardless on the lower grain size [26]. Young\u2019s modu-\nlus progressively decreases with increasing Si content, which is\nrelated to changes in the binding energy between ions due to Si\nincorporations. Similar hardness and Young\u2019s modulus evolution\nas a function of Si content has been reported in Refs [25,33].\n\nConcerning the effect of V addition on the hardness and Young\u2019\nmodulus, similar evolution was  observed for all films (see e.g.\n\nFig. 3b) for S1-y films). Although the variations are very small and\noften within the error bars of the hardness values, general trend is\na slight increase in hardness followed by drop for the highest vana-\ndium content.

The hardness\nnhance with V additions is probably due to the presence of V in\nolid solution. In fact, the similar level of residual stresses as func-\nion of V content measured, which revealed to be from the range\nf 3\u20134 GPa, and the observed shift of peaks to higher angles with V\nncorporation, supports the previous affirmation.\n\n.2. Continuous and isothermal oxidation in air\n\nThe effect of increasing Si and V content on the onset point of\nxidation of the TiN and TiSiN systems, respectively, are shown in\nig. 4. Silicon incorporation strongly improved the onset of oxida-\nion of the coatings, with the highest silicon content (S3-0) showing\nhe highest oxidation resistance. Kacsich et al. [34,35] reported that\nhe high oxidation resistance of these coatings was due to the pres-\nnce of a protective silicon-rich oxide layer. This layer acted as an\nfficient diffusion barrier against oxygen and metal ions diffusion;\nhus, it protected the coating from further oxidation. Our results\nhowed that the onset point of oxidation of films decreased sig-\nificantly down to a temperature of approximately 500 ?C (lower\nhan TiN) for all coatings containing vanadium. Interestingly, this\nehaviour was independent of Si content of the films and, there-\nore, the vanadium incorporation interfered with the diffusion of\nilicon and the consequent formation of a continuous protective\nilicon oxide layer. Furthermore, all V-containing coatings were\nompletely oxidized at a lower temperature than TiN film. Lewis\nt al. [7], Zhou et al. [36], and Franz et al. [37], who studied the effect\nf V doping on the oxidation behaviour of multilayered TiAlN/VN\nnd CrAlVN coatings, respectively, also observed a similar decrease\nn the onset point of oxidation. In order to better characterize the\nxidation behaviour of the V rich coatings, isothermal oxidation\nests were conducted at selected temperatures using S2-8 coating\neposited onto FeCrAl alloy substrates. The isothermal curves were\nompared with those of TiSiN coating with similar Si content and\nith TiN (see Fig. 5).\n\nComparing the mass gain of the coatings and taking into account\nhe testing temperature in each case, it is possible to conclude that\n-free TiSiN coating (S2-0 tested at 900 ?C) is much more resistant\n\no oxidation. This coating exhibits a typical parabolic oxidation\neight gain as a function of time indicating the formation of\nrotective silicon-rich oxide layer, as referred to above. Similar\nype of evolution is exhibited by TiN coating; however, in this case\n\nhe titanium oxide scale does not protect the coatings and, thus,\nt is effective only at low isothermal temperature [38]. It should\ne remarked that during continuous oxidation test up to 1200 ?C,\nt 900 ?C TiN coatings was already half consumed.

The isothermal curves tested\nat 550 and 600 ?C showed two  steps: at an early stage, the weight\ngain is rapidly increasing almost linearly up to approximately\n0.1 mg/cm2 (particularly at 600 ?C), whereas in the second stage,\na parabolic evolution can be fitted. Isothermal annealing of S2-8\nat 700 ?C shows significant increase of mass gain following the\nparabolic evolution.\n\n3.2.1. Surface structure\nAs it would be expected, both TiN annealed at 600 ?C and S2-0\n\ncoating annealed at 900 ?C exhibited several intense peaks belong-\ning to the (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (2 0 0), (1 1 1) and (2 1 0) of a tetragonal\nphase related to rutile/TiO2 (ICDD card 76-0649) (not shown here).\nWeak peaks assigned to TiN (ICDD card 87-0628) were observed\nin the XRD spectra of the S2-0 coating, which was in a good agree-\nment with its annealing curve, since only partial oxidation of the\nfilm was expected. Moreover, diffraction peaks associated with Si\noxide were not detected on the oxidized surface of S2-0 film sug-\ngesting an amorphous character of the protective oxide layer. This\nresult is in agreement with literature, where similar observation\nwas  reported [34,35].\n\nXRD patterns of S2-8 oxidized coatings in isothermal tests are\nshown in Fig. 6. The main phases detected by XRD were Ti\u2013V\u2013O\nand V\u2013O oxides; however, depending on the isothermal temper-\nature and time, different orientations and peaks assigned to V\u2013O\nwere perceived. After annealing at 550 ?C during 1 h, the follow-\ning phases could be identified: Ti(V)O2 (ICDD card 77-0332) and\n?-V2O5 (ICDD card 41-1426) with a preferred orientation follow-\ning the (0 0 1) plane (peak at 20.3?), together with the f.c.c. nitride\nfrom the coating. The same phases were detected at 600 ?C during\n10 min, however, ?-V2O5 phase showed random orientation. Fur-\nther increase in isothermal time (annealing at 600 ?C during 30 min)\nresulted in loss of TiN peaks and the orientation of the ?-V2O5 phase\nis again following (0 0 1) plane. The absence of TiN peaks is in good\nagreement with the isothermal curve shown in Fig. 5. Progressive\noxidation is demonstrated in the intensity of (0 0 1) reflection after\n30 min  of annealing, where the amount of ?-V2O5 is clearly higher.\nThese changes in phase proportion and orientation have already\nbeen observed by several authors during the oxidation of TiAlN/VN\nmultilayer and TiAlVN single layered coatings [1,7,8,36]. Increas-\n\ning the heat treatment to 700 ?C, which is temperature higher than\nthe melting point of ?-V2O5 (?685 ?C [10,36]), resulted in the ran-\ndom orientation of this phase; moreover, a sharp peak at 2? = 12.8?\n\nidentified as ?-V2O5 (ICDD card 45-1074) with (0 0 2) preferential\n\n\n\n118 F.

The Raman spectra of these\nzones are plotted in Fig. 9. As can be observed the light grey phase\ndisplays Raman active modes at 152, 253, 454 and 610 cm?1 [3,23]\nassigned to rutile, confirming its presence in the oxidized coating\ndetected by XRD. The same phase, with much less intensity, was\ndetected for the dark grey phase; however, strong additional peaks\nassigned to anatase (TiO2) were observed. This finding corroborates\nthe report of Pilloud et al. [23], who  showed that anatase Raman\nbands increased with the silicon content in TiSiN films, whereas\nthat of rutile decreased. As only strong peaks of rutile were detected\nby XRD, this indicates that the amount of anatase should be small\nand, therefore, not detectable by XRD diffraction. Since Raman pen-\netration depth is relatively limited, the absence of silicon oxide in\nRaman spectra indicated that Si\u2013O was  below theTiO2 phase iden-\ntified by XRD. This finding corroborates the results of Kacsich et al.\n[34,35]; they observed titanium oxide layer formed at outmost sur-\nface and silicon oxide sublayer (TiSiN coatings).\n\nThe analysis of the oxidized surface of S2-8 coating reveals that\nthe surface oxide morphology is different from that of coating S2-\n0. It displays a floret-like structure formed by light and dark grey\nzones. At 550 ?C these phases are tiny distributed throughout the\nsurface, being difficult to clearly identify the boundaries between\nthem. At a temperature of 600 ?C, the separation between both\nzones is evident with the shape of darker zone suggesting some type\nof dendritic growth. With the increase of the isothermal time, an\nincrease in the area covered by the grey dark phase was observed.\nThe temperature 700 ?C led to a different oxide morphology, i.e.\nthe appearance of a black zone in some rosettes and the segrega-\ntion of a white phase to the boundaries of the floret-like structure.\nThis change in the microstructure can be associated to the melting\nof ?-V2O5, which originates a smoother surface (Fig. 8d)). Fig. 10\nshows examples of EDS spectra of points identified in Fig. 8 (phases\n1 and 2). As can be observed, Ti K? peak (4.931 keV) overlaps the V\nK? peak (4.952 keV) and, therefore, V K? peak should be taken in\nconsideration for analyzing V importance. In order to identify the\ndifferent oxide phases marked in Fig. 8, the ratio between the peaks\nintensities of V K? (Si K?) and Ti K? from EDS analyses are sum-\nmarized in Table 3. To a relative increase in this ratio corresponds\nthe preferential formation of the oxide of that element. EDS analy-\nses of points 1 and 2 reveal similar compositions for the grey light\nand dark zones, suggesting the presence of oxides containing Ti, Si\nand V. However, darker phase has clearly a higher V content (see\nTable 3). The Raman spectrum taken at grey dark phase (see Fig. 11)\nshows the presence of intense peaks assigned to ?-V2O5 [3,8,10]\nand small peaks related to rutile (TiO2). On light grey phase the\nspectrum is much less defined, with broader bands. ?-V2O5 peaks\nalmost vanished whereas rutile bands are enhanced. Low crystal-\nlized Ti\u2013O phases give very similar Raman spectra, which evolve,\nafter annealing, either as anatase or rutile [41,42] phases. In sum-\nmary, the dark grey phase can be assigned mainly to ?-V2O5, and\nsmall quantities of TiO2, probably as a bilayer with ?-V2O5 on the\ntop and TiO2 underneath, as suggested by EDS measurements. In\nfact, the high ratio of V/Ti of point 3 marked in Fig. 8, allows iden-\ntifying a V-rich oxide, on the surrounding regions of the dark grey\nphase. The light grey phase should be attributed to low crystallized\nTi(V)O2. These results agree to the XRD results acquired on the oxi-\ndized surface of the films where both Ti(V)O2 and ?-V2O5 phases\nwere indexed. When the isothermal time was prolonged from 10 to\n30 min  at 600 ?C, the increase of the intensity of the ?-V2O5 peak\nobserved in the XRD patterns was is in a good agreement with a\nhigher amount of grey dark phase observed on the oxidized surface\n\nmorphology.\n\nSimilarly to S2-0 coating signals from Si\u2013O oxide were neither\ndetected by XRD nor by Raman spectroscopy. However, according\nto EDS analysis this oxide should be present. As these signals are\n\n\n\n120 F. Fernandes et al. / Applied Surface Science 289 (2014) 114\u2013 123\n\nFig. 8.

Sig-\nnals of elements from the substrate were detected in the dark phase,\nparticularly Al, which in conjunction with XRD results, allowed\nidentifying it as ?-V2O5. In fact, it is well known, that the loss of O\nfrom ?-V2O5, due to a reduction process, leads to its transformation\nin ?-V2O5 [40,43]. The presence of highly oxygen reactive elements,\nsuch as aluminium, in the substrate can reduce the molten ?-V2O5,\nsubtracting O and promoting the formation of ?-V2O5. The Raman\nspectra of the dark and light grey phases plotted in Fig. 12 show\nsimilar Raman patterns with peaks related to V2O5. Both ?- and\n?-V2O5 display similar Raman spectra [44]. The segregated white\nareas located at the boundaries of the grey phase (see ratio Si/Ti of\npoint 5) were rich in Si and Ti, suggesting to be silicon and titanium\n\noxides.\n\nA good correlation was found between the isothermal oxida-\ntion curve, XRD measurements and surface morphology of S2-8\ncoating.

Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) of points 1 and 2 identified in Fig. 8.\n\nsothermal oxidation curve starts with a linear increase in the mass\nain and then changes to a parabolic law. The XRD spectra of spec-\nmen S2-8 oxidized during 10 min  at 600 ?C, in the first stage of\nhe oxidation process, revealed the presence of intense peaks of\n-V2O5. Further increase in isothermal time to 30 min  showed an\n\nncreased amount of ?-V2O5, as confirmed by the increase of the\nrey dark phase, above attributed to V-rich zones. XRD pattern\nor this sample also showed an increase in Ti(V)O2 peaks inten-\nity suggesting a thickening of the oxide scale. Therefore, the first\ninear part of the isothermal curve is due to the oxidation of both\nitanium and vanadium to form Ti(V)O2 and ?-V2O5, respectively.\n-V2O5 is a non-protective oxide and Ti(V)O2 is still not in enough\nmounts to form a continuous protective scale, reason why a linear\n\nxidation rate is observed. For longer oxidation times, the progres-\nive thickening of the Ti-rich oxide scale will make difficult the\nxygen diffusion inward retarding the reaction and promoting the\narabolic behaviour. However, the protection is not so efficient\n\nFig. 11. Raman spectra of phase 1 and 2 identified in Fig. 8.\nFig. 12. Raman spectra of phase 4 and 5 identified in Fig. 8.\n\nas in TiN and/or Ti\u2013Si\u2013N samples (see Fig. 5) due to the disrup-\ntion induced by the outward/lateral diffusion of V ions through the\noxide scale. In any condition the protective Si\u2013O layer could be also\nformed. Similar isothermal evolution was reported by Zhou et al.\n[36], which during isothermal oxidation of multilayered TiAlN/VN\ncoatings have detected ?-V2O5 at the initial stage of oxidation.\nIn their system, the mass gain curves also showed initially a lin-\near evolution, followed by a parabolic growth, similar to what\nwas  observed here for TiSiVN films. Keller and Douglass [45] also\nshowed that pure vanadium oxidizes linearly, whereas the addition\nof different elements (Al, Cr, Ti) could transform the initial linear\nmass gain for a parabolic one due to the modification of the formed\noxide layer.\n\nAt 700 ?C, temperature higher than the melting point of ?-\nV2O5, very high oxidation rates were measured and high amounts\nof V-oxides were detected by XRD. The extremely high parabolic\nevolution suggests a very high diffusion rate of the reactive ions\nthrough the oxide scales.\n\nA comparison between TiSiVN with CrAlVN and TiAlVN (in\nsingle layered or multilayered configuration) coatings, reveals a\nlower onset point of oxidation of approximately 100 ?C. In CrAlVN\nand TiAlVN coatings the onset point of oxidation was  close to\n?600 ?C [8,36,37]. In the case of the TiAlVN films, signals of lubri-\ncious ?-V2O5 were detected as soon as the oxidation started,\nwhile at high temperatures only AlVO4 and TiO2 were identi-\nfied [8]. For CrAlVN coatings, AlVO4, (Al, Cr, V)2O3 as well as\n?-V2O5 oxides were observed for an annealing temperature of\n700 ?C [37]. In these studies, the lower onset point of oxidation\ndisplayed by the V-containing coatings was explained by the reac-\ntions occurring between protective oxides and vanadium (such as\nformation of Al\u2013V\u2013O phases). In the present TiSiVN system com-\nbination of V with titanium or silicon oxide was not detected.\nTherefore, we  suggest that the loss of oxidation resistance of\nTiSiVN coatings is due to the rapid oxidation of V and the out-\nwards diffusion of its ions through the Ti-rich oxide scale. Further\nwork is needed to understand the mechanisms involved during\nthe oxidation deterioration of TiSiN coatings with V additions\nand their corresponding oxide scale formation. The performance\nof solid solution coatings for high temperature sliding applica-\ntion should be investigated in further work. Rapid formation of\nvanadium oxide could indeed reduce friction at temperatures\nhigher than 500 ?C; nonetheless, the wear resistance of the coat-\ning can be significantly compromised by low oxidation resistance.\n\nIn future research, we propose to deposit nanocomposite struc-\nture of TiSiVN combining nanograins of c-TiVN embedded into\namorphous Si\u2013N matrix, to control the outwards diffusion of\nvanadium.\n\n\n\n1 urface\n\n4\n\nt\nT\nt\nA\ns\nr\nt\nw\no\np\nt\nd\ni\np\ns\ns\no\nw\no\nt\nV\nt\nc\n\nA\n\nt\nC\np\nC\nC\na\n\nR\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n22 F.

Conclusion\n\nThis investigation concerned the influence of V additions on\nhe structure, mechanical properties and oxidation resistance of\ni\u2013Si\u2013V\u2013N coatings deposited by DC reactive magnetron sput-\nering. These coatings were compared to TiN and TiSiN films.\nccording to XRD analyses, all coatings showed an fcc NaCl-type\ntructure assigned to crystalline TiN. A shift of the peaks to the\night was observed with Si and V additions, indicative of a substitu-\nional solid solution. Hardness and Young modulus of TiSiN coatings\nas insignificantly changed with increasing V content. The onset of\n\nxidation of the coatings decreased with V additions down to tem-\neratures as low as 500 ?C, independently of the Si and V content in\nhe coatings. TiN and TiSiN coating exhibits a typical parabolic oxi-\nation weight gain as a function of time, while a different evolution\n\ns displayed by TiSiVN films. At temperatures below the melting\noint of ?-V2O5 (?685 ?C) two stages were exhibited: at an early\ntage, the weight increase over time is linear, whilst, in a second\ntage a parabolic evolution could be fitted to the experimental data;\nn the other hand, at high temperatures only a parabolic evolution\nas fitted. ?-V2O5 showed to be the main phase present at the\n\nxidized surface of coatings. Reduction of this phase occurred for\nemperatures above their melting point. The relative amounts of\n2O5 detected at the oxidized surface of V rich films are promising\n\no achieve the envisaged good tribological properties; however it\nan be significantly compromised by their low oxidation resistance.\n\ncknowledgments\n\nThis research is sponsored by FEDER funds through\nhe program COMPETE\u2013Programa Operacional Factores de\nompetitividade\u2013and by national funds through FCT \u2013 Fundac? \u00e3o\nara a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia, under the projects: PEst-\n/EME/UI0285/2013, CENTRO-07-0224-FEDER-002001 (Mais\nentro SCT 2011 02 001 4637), PTDC/EME-TME/122116/2010\nnd Plungetec, as well as the grant (SFRH/BD/68740/2010).\n\neferences\n\n[1] Z.

A dual layer \n\noxide was formed in the case of TiSiN coating with a protective Si-O layer at an \n\noxide/coating interface; however, in zones of film defects a complex oxide structure was \n\ndeveloped. V additions increased the oxidation rate of the coatings as a result of the inversion \n\nof the oxidation mechanism due to ions diffusion throughout the oxide scale, which inhibited \n\nthe formation of a continuous protective silicon oxide layer. \n\n \n\nKeywords: TiSiVN system, structural evolution, oxidation, oxide scale, diffusion processes \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\n \n\nTiSiN solid solution or nanocomposite coatings are well established in applications \n\nlike high speed cutting and dry machining processes due to their excellent oxidation resistance \n\nand high hardness. However, the main drawback of the aforementioned coating system is their \n\nhigh friction coefficient, typically in the range of 0.6 - 1.3 at room and high temperatures [1]. \n\nRecently, the formation of thin reaction films in sliding contacts has provided the basis for \n\ndevelopment of adaptive, self-lubricating coatings guaranteeing low friction at high \n\ntemperature. Magn\u00e9li phase oxides based on Ti, Si, Mo, W and V, with low shear strength \n\nmailto:filipe.fernandes@dem.uc.pt\n\n\nAnnex H \n\n174 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nhave attracted the scientific community and particular attention has been given to vanadium \n\noxide. The beneficial influence of Magn\u00e9li oxides formed by oxidation of vanadium on the \n\nfriction has already been reported for ternary CrVN [2], (V,Ti)N [3], multilayer AlN/VN [4], \n\nquaternary single layer or multilayered CrAlVN [5-6], and TiAlVN [7-8] systems. Recently \n\nwe have reported the effect of V incorporation on the structure, mechanical properties and \n\noxidation resistance of TiSiVN films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering [9]. \n\nLubricious vanadium oxides have been successfully detected on the oxidized surface of these \n\nfilms. Here we show the thermal stability, oxide formation and, particularly, diffusion \n\nprocesses during annealing of TiSiVN films deposited by magnetron sputtering. \n\n \n\n2. Experimental procedure \n\n \n\nTiSiN and TiSiVN coatings with approximately the same silicon content and about 2.5 \n\n\u00b5m of total thickness, were deposited on FeCrAl alloy substrates by a d.c. reactive magnetron \n\nsputtering machine equipped with two rectangular, Ti (99.9%) and TiSi2 (99.9%), magnetron \n\ncathodes working in unbalanced mode. V incorporation was achieved by inserting 8 pellets of \n\nvanadium into the erosion zone of Ti target. In both cases Ti and TiN adhesion layers were \n\ndeposited as bonding layers improving coating to substrate adhesion. The interlayer also \n\ncontained V when V pellets are placed in the Ti target. A detail description of the deposition \n\nconditions is reported elsewhere [9]. Temperature effect on the structure of the V rich coating \n\nwas characterized by in-situ hot-XRD analysis in the range from 500 \u00baC up to 750 \u00baC, in open \n\nair, using a grazing incidence angle of 2\u00ba and Co K? radiation (1.789010 \u00c5). Between each \n\nselected temperature a step of 10 min holding time was allowed for thermal stabilization and \n\n30 min time acquisition was used. Oxidation of films was assessed by thermogravimetric \n\nanalysis (TGA) using industrial air (99.99% purity). The coatings were isothermal tested at \n\ndifferent selected temperatures and times, based on the thermogravimetric oxidation curves of \n\nfilms performed at constant linear-temperature ramp (RT to 1200?C at 20?C/min) shown in \n\nreference [9]. These isothermal tests were performed having in consideration the temperatures \n\nwhere the oxidation showed takes mainly place. After annealing, the cross section thin foils of \n\noxidized films was prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) and analyzed by transmission \n\nelectron microscope (TEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray (EDS) spectroscopy \n\nsystem. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnex H \n\n175 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n3.1. Phase evolution during annealing (in situ) \n\n \n\nThe investigated coatings with chemical composition of Ti0.80Si0.13N and \n\nTi0.65Si0.11V0.14N showed a typical columnar morphology and fcc NaCl-type structure \n\nassigned to crystalline TiN with Si and V in solid solution [9]. Fig. 1 plots the high \n\ntemperature in-situ XRD spectra evolution for TiSiVN coating together with as deposited and \n\ncooled state patterns acquired at room temperature (RT). The first signs of oxides were \n\ndetected at 500 \u00baC and identified as rutile type phase with V in solid solution, the Ti(V)O2 \n\n(ICDD card 77-0332). Further increase in temperature to 550 \u00baC led to an increase of the \n\nTi(V)O2 peaks intensity and the appearance of a new phase: the ?-V2O5 (ICDD card 41-1426) \n\noxide with orthorhombic symmetry (peak at 23.6\u00ba). At 600 \u00baC a strong increase in intensity of \n\nthe ?-V2O5 oxide peaks with a strong preferred orientation following the (001) plane was \n\nobserved (peak at 23.5\u00ba). Moreover, a metastable phase was formed, ?-V2O5, as a result of \n\noxygen loss from ?-V2O5 due to a reduction process [10]. It should be also pointed out that \n\nthe higher intensity of V2O5 peaks in relation to other peaks suggests higher quantity on the \n\noxidized volume. The temperature increase to 650 \u00baC led to TiN peaks vanishing suggesting \n\nthe formation of a thick oxide scale. At 675 \u00baC, the peaks associated with the V2O5 phases \n\ndisappeared, which was in a good agreement with the melting point of V2O5 oxide (reported \n\nin the range of 670 \u2013 685 \u00baC [11]). On the other hand, peaks related to a V3O5 phase, which \n\nresulted from the ?-V2O5 reduction, were found. In fact, in case of oxygen deficiency, a shift \n\nto lower valence state leads to the formation of reduced oxides, such as V3O5 identified in the \n\ncurrent XRD pattern. Further increase in temperature resulted mostly in the increase of V3O5 \n\npeaks intensities due to continuous reduction of liquid V2O5 phase. Ti(V)O2, V3O5, V2O3 and \n\nVO reduced phases were found after annealing, as well as a new polymorph V2O5 oxide: ?\u2019- \n\nV2O5 (ICDD card 85-2422). This oxide has an orthorhombic structure as ?-V2O5 phase, but \n\nwith different diffraction planes. These changes could be attributed to distortions on the \n\nstructure motivated by the cooling of liquid-phase. Double chains exist in both phases, but \n\nVO5 pyramids alternate up and down individually for ?\u2019- V2O5, whereas they alternate by \n\npairs for normal ?-V2O5 phase [12]. \n\n\n\nAnnex H \n\n176 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - XRD spectra of TiSiVN film at different temperatures (upper) and position of main peaks of \n\ncorresponding phases (lower). \n\n3.2. Isothermal oxidation in air, surface morphology and characterization \n\n \n\nTiSiN film was annealed at 900 \n0\nC for 1 hour, TiSiVN coating was annealled at two \n\ndifferent isothermal temperatures. The results of the thermo gravimetric analysis are presented \n\nin Fig. 2 a). As expected, TiSiN film is much more resistant to oxidation, showing a typical \n\nparabolic oxidation weight gain as a fuction of time, which indicates the presence of \n\nprotective oxide scales. Vanadium addition to TiSiN film strongly reduced the oxidation \n\nresistance. The isothermal curves at 550 \u00baC and 600 \u00baC showed two steps: they started with a \n\nlinear increase in mass gain and then followed with a parabolic evolution. The surface \n\nmorphologies of the oxidized coatings are shown in Fig. 2 b-c) for coatings TiSiN tested at \n\n900 \u00baC and TiSiVN oxidized at 600 \u00baC, respectively. The detailed description of the surface \n\noxide constitution, based on XRD diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and SEM-EDS analyses, \n\ncan be found in our previous study [9]. Therefore we will only summarize here the main \n\nresults to support investigation aimed at diffusion processes and described later. Annealed \n\nTiSiN film (see Fig. 2b) displayed two different surface features: white and dark gray islands \n\nevenly distributed on the surface. Raman analyses revealed that white phase was rutile (TiO2), \n\nwhile dark gray phase was a mixture of rutile and anatase. However, only rutile peaks were \n\ndetected by XRD diffraction suggesting very limited amount of anatase in the dark gray \n\nislands. Furthermore, strong signals of Si were detected on dark zone by EDS. However, the \n\nsignals of silicon oxide were neither detected by XRD nor by Raman spectroscopy indicating \n\n16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54\n\ncooling down)\n       (after\n\nVO\nV\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n\nV\n3\nO\n\n5\n\n?'???V\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n????V\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n???V\n?\n?\n\n?\n\nTi(V)O\n2\n\nRT\n\n750 \n0\nC\n\n700 \n0\nC\n\n675 \n0\nC\n\n650 \n0\nC\n\n600 \n0\nC\n\n550 \n0\nC\n\n500 \n0\nC\n\n \n\n2??\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n I\nn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\nRT\n\nTiN\n\n\n\nAnnex H \n\n177 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\namorphous character, which corroborates previous reports [13-14]. Silicon oxide was \n\npositioned below Ti-O rich layer. Different morphology and oxide phases were detected on \n\nthe oxidized surface of TiSiVN coating. At 600 \u00baC, the film displayed a floret-like structure \n\nformed by light and dark gray phases. XRD diffraction showed the presence of ?-V2O5 and \n\nTi(V)O2 oxides. Although EDS analysis revealed similar spectra for both phases, the much \n\nless intensity of the V peak on the light gray phase, and its conjugation with Raman analysis \n\nallowed identifying dark and light gray phases as ?-V2O5 and Ti(V)O2 oxides, respectively. \n\nSimilar phases were detected at 550 \u00baC by XRD; however, only small dark gray areas were \n\nobserved at the surface. These results match well with high temperature in-situ XRD \n\ndiffractograms (Fig. 1), where these phases were indexed. Similar to TiSiN coating, the signal \n\nfrom Si-O phase was neither detected by XRD nor by Raman. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - a) Isothermal oxidation curves of coatings, b-c) typical surface morphologies. \n\n0 1200 2400 3600\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\nS2-8 500 \u00baC 1 h\n\nS2-0 900 \u00baC 1 h\n\nS2-8 600 \u00baC 30 min\n\na)\n\nW\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \ng\na\nin\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/c\n\nm\n2\n)\n\nTime (s)\n\n50 \u00b5m 500 \u00b5m\n\nDark gray phase\n\nWhite phase\n\n5 \u00b5m\n\nGray phase\n\nDark phase\n\nb) c)\n\n20 \u00b5m\n\nTiSiN 900 0C 1h TiSiVN 600 0C 30 min\n\n\n\nAnnex H \n\n178 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nFigure 3 shows the growing mechanism of the V2O5 phase over the Ti(V)O2 oxide. \n\nNucleation points of V2O5 started being formed over the oxidized surface, growing up by \n\nvanadium lateral diffusion as suggested by the V depleted white and V rich black regions \n\nmarked in the SEM micrograph. In order to investigate the oxide scale films growth, TEM \n\ncross-sections were prepared by FIB from TiSiN and TiSiVN films annealed at 900 and 600 \n\n\u00baC, respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Oxidized surface of TiSiVN coating showing the growing mechanism of V2O5 phase. \n\n3.3. Cross section of oxidized surfaces by TEM and oxidation kinetics \n\n \n\nFig. 4 and 5 displays the bright-field STEM images, associated elemental maps and \n\nscanning elemental profiles from cross section of oxidized TiSiN and TiSiVN coatings. In the \n\ncase of TiSiN film a multilayer of oxides can be identified, being more complex close to the \n\nfilm defect (white zones) shown in Fig. 4a): (i) an outer Ti-rich layer comprised by shaped \n\ncrystals with bigger size in the top of the film defect, zone corresponding to the white phase \n\nand, (ii) a Si-rich layer, which is itself divided in 3 layers on the zone around the defect, an \n\nintermediate layer containing Ti, sandwiched between two Ti-free layers, being the external \n\nporous and the internal one very compact. Far from the film defect (left zone of the \n\nmicrograph), below to the TiO2 crystals only a homogeneous Si-rich layer was observed. The \n\nmeasured elemental cross-section depth profiles for two lines were plotted in Fig. 4b) and 4c), \n\nrespectively. The profiles corroborated STEM/EDX elemental mapping showing in detail the \n\ncomposition of surface oxides. The surface layer formed exclusively of Ti-O was followed by \n\na Si-rich layer with scattering in the signals intensity, in agreement with brightness intensity \n\nin figures 4 a). It is clear in Ti-signal a small increase in intensity in the zone of high-Si \n\ncontent. This variation is more intense in line 2 than in line 1, suggesting an influence of the \n\nfilm defect, which is closer to line 2.

The oxidation process will then \n\noccur through the inwards diffusion of O\n2-\n\n through the TiO2 layer and the outwards diffusion \n\nof Ti\n4+\n\n through the Si-O layer [15]. Nevertheless, due to the presence of film defects, in the \n\nfirst stage of the oxidation process, a high amount of Ti ions will be supplied in that zone \n\ncorresponding to the oxidation occurring in the defect walls. This process will promote the \n\nformation of a porous Si-O layer, with low diffusion barrier performance to the out diffusion \n\nof Ti\n4+\n\n ions, leading to large TiO2 crystals on the oxide scale surface. From the moment that a \n\nSi-O barrier layer is formed in the defect walls (see Si signal in figure 4 a)) the oxidation \n\nprocess will be controlled by the O\n2-\n\n inward and Ti\n4+\n\n outward ions diffusion trough the Si-O \n\nlayer [15]. It should be remarked that this phenomenon should not influence significantly the \n\nglobal oxidation behavior of the Ti-Si-N coating (which shows the parabolic behavior \n\npresented in Fig. 2 a), in agreement with literature [13-15]) since, on the one hand, it only \n\noccurs in a few defects in the films surface (see Fig. 2 b)) and, on the other, it should be more \n\nintense in the first stage of the oxidation, during heating up to the 900 \u00baC isothermal oxidation \n\ntemperature. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - a) Bright field STEM/EDX maps of TiSiN coating oxidized at 900 \n0\nC during 1h. b) and c).

This step, where a continuous Ti(V)O2 \n\noxide layer was grown (see Fig. 1), should be attributed to the conjugation of a fast rate of \n\nmass transport in the oxide with a slow surface step accompanying the gas dissociation, \n\nadsorption and subsequent entry of oxygen into the Ti(V)O2 lattice. In fact, at the very \n\nbeginning of the oxidation process, due to the high Ti content, a TiO2 layer starts growing. \n\nThe presence of V ions and its high solubility with Ti promote the formation of Ti(V)O2 solid \n\nsolution, which comprises vanadium cations with lower oxidation states as V\n3+\n\n ions [16-17]. \n\nThe substitution of Ti\n4+\n\n by V\n3+\n\n ions in the TiO2 lattice would increase the concentration of \n\ninterstitial metallic Ti\n4+\n\n ions and decrease the number of excess electrons. The oxidation \n\nmechanism is inverted in relation to Ti-N, being the outwards diffusion of metallic ions (Ti\n3+\n\n \n\nTi\nn+\n\n) more favorable that the inwards diffusion of O\n2- \n\nions. There are several consequences of \n\nthis inversion: (i) the oxidation rate increases substantially, (ii) the kinetics of the oxidation is \n\nnot controlled any more by a diffusion process but by the rate of dissociation, adsorption and \n\ncombination at the surface of O\n2-\n\n with metallic ions, and (iii) continuous and compact Si-rich \n\nlayer cannot be formed. In fact, the growing of Ti(V)-O on the external part of the scale \n\nleaves a less compact zone in the interface between the non-oxidized material and the oxide \n\nscale, facilitating the local segregation of Si inside the Ti(V)-O instead its segregation for the \n\ninterface. The elemental maps suggest that Si-O and Ti(V)O2 coexist in the inner porous \n\nlayer, being unable to protect the material from oxidation. As a consequence, the oxidation \n\nprocess is accelerated, which is demonstrated by the initial rapid oxidation observed in the \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n400\n\n800\n\n1200\n\n1600\n\n2000\n\nIncreasing of V\n\nand O counts\n\n?Ti K?\n\n?O K? / Ti K?\n\n?Si K? / Ti K?\n\n?V K? / Ti K?\n\nS\nu\n\nb\ns\ntr\n\na\nte\n\nT\ni \nin\n\nte\nrl\na\n\ny\ne\n\nr\n\nT\niN\n\n i\nn\n\nte\nrl\na\n\ny\ne\n\nr\n\nCoating\n\nc)\n\nOxidized zone\n\nC\no\nu\nn\nts\n\nDistance (?m)\n\n\n\nAnnex H \n\n183 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nisothermal curve. Thongtem et al. [16] studied the effect of V doping to Ti-based alloys and \n\nobserved similar behavior with increasing V content. \n\nThe experimental evidence shows that V2O5 crystals were formed exclusively on the \n\nsurface. When V\n3+\n\n or V\n4+\n\n arrive to the surface, they are further oxidized to V\n5+\n\n combining \n\nwith O ions and  creating nucleation points for the V2O5 growth (see Fig. 3), which will \n\nexpand and grow up by vanadium lateral diffusion. The process develops leading to the \n\nformation of the observed floret-like dispersive V2O5 phases that can comprise both ?-V2O5 \n\nand ?-V2O5 phases as evidenced in the XRD patterns at high temperature. As soon as V2O5 \n\noxide expands laterally, the surface will be progressively covered by this oxide making more \n\nand more difficult the access of both types of ions, up to the moment that the rate of \n\ndissociation, adsorption and combination of O\n2-\n\n with metallic ions is not anymore the kinetics \n\ncontrolling step but the ion diffusion through the oxide scale. Therefore, after this moment the \n\nisothermal curve will follow a parabolic law (see Fig. 2a)). It should be remarked that V2O5 is \n\nmore protective than (Ti,V)O2 since the non-oxidized coating underneath it is thicker. \n\n \n\n4. Conclusion \n\n \n\nIn this investigation, the effect of V additions on oxidation resistance, oxide scale \n\nformation and diffusion processes for TiSiVN system and their comparison to TiSiN was \n\ninvestigated. In summary, we demonstrated that oxidation of TiSiN is controlled by the \n\nformation of a dense and compact silicon oxide acting as a diffusion barrier, which can be \n\naffected by defects in the as-deposited film. The presence of V\n3+\n\n ions in the TiO2 scale, during \n\nthe oxidation of TiSiVN film, was responsible for an inversion in the ions diffusion process \n\nthrough the oxide scale leading to, simultaneously, a significant increase of the oxidation rate \n\nand the inability of formation of a Si-O protective oxide. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nThis research is sponsored by FEDER funds through the program COMPETE \u2013 Programa \n\nOperacional Factores de Competitividade \u2013 and by national funds through FCT \u2013 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npara a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia \u2013, under the project: PTDC/EME-TME/122116/2010, as well as \n\nthe grant (SFRH/BD/68740/2010).

Introduction \n\n \n\nOver the past years, ternary titanium-based nitride coatings, such as TiXN (X = B, Cr, \n\nAl, Si, Cr, C, etc.), have been largely employed in industrial applications involving cutting \n\ntools, wear protection, machinery components and high temperature parts, due to their high \n\nhardness and suitable wear and oxidation resistance [1, 2]. However, in dry machining \n\noperations, the tools experience extremely harsh conditions combining abrasion, adhesion, \n\noxidation, mechanical and thermal loads, which limit their lifetime. Since low friction \n\ncoefficients can effectively reduce the contact temperatures during sliding and, consequently, \n\nimprove the tribological behavior of tools, a lot of efforts has been carried out in the last years \n\nto develop self-lubricant coatings. These films should retain beneficial properties of (TiX)N \n\nfilms and offer lubricity through the formation of low-friction surface oxides. Recently, the \n\nattention of the scientific community has been focused on the formation of thin reaction films \n\nof the so-called Magn\u00e9li oxide phases based on Ti, Si, Mo, W and V, which possess easy \n\nshear planes [3, 4]. Among these elements, particular attention has been given to vanadium-\n\ncontaining coatings which form VnO3n-1 Magn\u00e9li phases. Over the whole ternary systems the \n\neffect of V doping was only extensively studied for ternary CrAlN [5, 6] and TiAlN [2, 7-9] \n\ncoatings in single layer or multilayered configurations. In all the cases a beneficial influence \n\nof V additions on the tribological behaviour of the coatings at room and high temperatures has \n\nbeen demonstrated. Since other ternary coating systems with superior mechanical properties \n\nhave been successfully used as protective coatings in tribological applications, the effect of \n\nvanadium doping on their structure should also be considered. This is the case of TiSiN \n\nsystem, which shows similar levels of oxidation resistance as CrAlN and TiAlN films. \n\nPreliminary studies on the effect of V additions on the structure, mechanical properties and \n\noxidation resistance of TiSiN systems have been carried out in our previous investigation \n\n[10]. Hence, as a way to complement that study, the aim of this work was to characterize the \n\ntribological behaviour at room temperature of TiSiVN sputtered coatings, sliding against \n\nAl2O3 and HSS balls. The influence of V addition on the TiSiN system was compared with \n\nthe tribological results of TiN, Ti0.82V0.15N and Ti0.80Si0.15N coatings prepared and tested as a \n\nreference. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n191 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n2. Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\nTiSiVN coatings with dissimilar Si and V contents, evaluated in our previous work \n\n[10], were deposited by d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering from two rectangular (100\u00d7200 \n\nmm) magnetron cathodes working in unbalanced mode. High speed steel (AISI M2), FeCrAl \n\nalloy, cemented carbides, silicon and stainless steel substrates were coated for mechanical, \n\nstructural, chemical composition and residual stress measurements. A high purity Ti (99.9%) \n\ntarget, with 10 mm diameter holes, and a high purity TiSi2 (99.9%) target were used in the \n\ndepositions. The coatings comprise three TiSiVN coatings with different V and Si contents \n\nand three other coatings deposited as a reference: TiN, Ti0.82V0.15N and Ti0.80Si0.15N. V \n\nincorporation was achieved by filling Ti holes with 4 and 8 V pellets being the remaining \n\nempty holes filled with pellets of Ti. Silicon content was varied by changing the power \n\ndensity applied to each target. Ti and TiN adhesion layers of approximately 0.24 and 0.45 \u00b5m, \n\nrespectively, were deposited below final TiSi(V)N coatings. The interlayers also contained V \n\nwhen V pellets were placed in the Ti target. A negative bias of 50 V was applied to the \n\nsubstrate holder. All the depositions were performed at a total working gas pressure of 0.3 Pa. \n\nThe deposition time was set in order to produce coatings with approximately 2.5 \u00b5m of total \n\nthickness, including interlayer referred to above. A full description of the deposition \n\nprocedure is given elsewhere [10]. Summary of the deposition parameters used for the \n\ncoatings production and their chemical composition determined by electron probe \n\nmicroanalysis (EPMA) are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The denomination of \n\nthe samples, as presented in tables 1 and 2, will be adopted throughout the paper in order to \n\nhelp the coatings identification and the paper reading. The subscript in Ti, Si and V letters \n\nrepresents the ratio between the at.% of each element in the coating in relation to the at.% of \n\nNitrogen. \n\nThe structure of the films was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (X\u2019 Pert Pro MPD \n\ndiffractometer) using a grazing incidence angle of 1\n\u00ba\n with Cu K?1 radiation (? = 1.54060 \u00c5). \n\nThe adhesion of the films on the M2 steel substrate was evaluated by a scratch-test apparatus. \n\nSpecimens were scratched as the normal force was increased linearly from 5 to 70 N, using a \n\nRockwell C indenter with a spherical tip with a radius of 0.2 mm, a scratch speed of 10 \n\nmm/min and a loading speed of 100 N/min. Critical loads were determined by optical \n\nmicroscope analysis according to the standard for scratch-test evaluation [11]. For each \n\nspecimen, the indicated critical loads results from the average of 3 different scratches. The \n\nhardness and Young\u2019s modulus of films were evaluated by depth-sensing indentation \n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n192 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\ntechnique (Micro Materials NanoTest) using a Berkovich diamond pyramid indenter. In order \n\nto avoid the effect of the substrate, the applied load (10 mN) was selected to keep the \n\nindentation depth less than 10% of the coating\u00b4s thickness. The residual stress values were \n\ncalculated through the Stoney equation [12] by measuring the differential deflection between \n\nan uncoated and coated stainless steel 25 mm diameter disk. \n\nThe tribological behaviour of the coatings was evaluated by dry-sliding tests at room \n\ntemperature on a pin on disc tribometer. Al2O3 and HSS steel balls (both with a diameter of 6 \n\nmm) were used as counterparts. The radius of the wear tracks was set to 5.3 and 4 mm for \n\nAl2O3 and HSS steel balls, respectively. All the measurements were performed with a linear \n\nspeed of 0.10 m.s\n-1\n\n, load of 5 N, relative humidity 48\u00b15% and 5000 cycles. The wear rate of \n\nthe coatings was determined from the area of the wear track cross section using a 3D optical \n\nprofilometer; an average from four different locations was used. The ball wear rates were \n\nevaluated from the wear cap images taken in an optical microscope. To ensure the \n\nreproducibility of results a set of three tests was performed under identical conditions for each \n\ncoating. After the wear tests, the wear tracks and wear debris were characterized by scanning \n\nelectron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Deposition parameters of the coatings.  \n\n  \nTarget power density \n\n(W/cm\n2\n) \n\nGas flow \n\n(sccm) Deposition time \n\n(min) \n\nPellets of V at the Ti \n\ntarget \nSample Ti TiSi2 Ar N2 \n\nTi interlayer 10 - 35 - 5 - \n\nTiN interlayer 10 - 35 17 15 - \n\nTiN 10 - 35 17 73 - \n\nTi0.82V0.15N 10 - 35 17 73 8 \n\nTi0.80Si0.15N 6 1.5 30 17 193 0 \n\nTi0.75Si0.11V0.03N 6 1.5 30 17 193 4 \n\nTi0.65Si0.11V0.15N 6 1.5 30 17 193 8 \n\nTi0.52Si0.20V0.14N 5 2.5 30 17 153 8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n193 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nTable 2 - Chemical composition of films in at.%. \n\nSample \nChemical composition (at.%) \n\nTi Si V O N \n\nTiN 49.6 \u00b1 0.4 - - 0.38 \u00b1 0.12 49.79 \u00b1 0.13 \n\nTi0.82V0.15N 41.3 \u00b1 0.2  -  7.81 \u00b1 0.11  0.53 \u00b1 0.12  50.42 \u00b1 0.10 \n\nTi0.80Si0.15N 41.3 \u00b1 0.3 6.68 \u00b1 0.03 - 0.55 \u00b1 0.06 51.5 \u00b1 0.2 \n\nTi0.75Si0.11V0.03N 39.3 \u00b1 0.4 5.71 \u00b1 0.06 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 1.22 \u00b1 0.10 52.1 \u00b1 0.2 \n\nTi0.65Si0.11V0.15N 33.6 \u00b1 0.3 5.64 \u00b1 0.05 7.6 \u00b1 0.2 1.42 \u00b1 0.13 51.71 \u00b1 0.14 \n\nTi0.52Si0.20V0.14N 27.2 \u00b1 0.2 10.73 \u00b1 0.06 7.32 \u00b1 0.05 1.96 \u00b1 0.11 52.8 \u00b1 0.2 \n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n3.1. Structure and mechanical properties of films \n\n \n\nThe X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-deposited films are shown in Figure 1. All the \n\ncoatings presents an fcc NaCl-type structure assigned to crystalline TiN phase, but different \n\npeaks position and intensities can be perceived. All films presented well defined peaks except \n\nfor the coating with higher silicon content (Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N) for which a strong decrease of \n\nthe peaks intensity as well a significant broadening was observed. This result suggests a \n\ndecrease of the crystallinity and grain size, in good accordance with literature where for TiSiN \n\nfilms with high Si contents amorphization of the structure is usually observed [13]. A closer \n\nanalysis of the peaks positions indicated that in all cases a fcc solid solution should be \n\nexpected. In fact, starting with the individual addition of V and Si to TiN, the peaks are \n\nshifted to higher angles, behaviour associated to a smaller unit cell (insert in Figure 1). Taking \n\ninto account that the residual stresses are very similar among these coatings (see table 3), such \n\na result can only be explained by the presence of V or Si in substitutional solid solution, due \n\nto their smaller radius (0.143 and 0.117 nm, respectively) in comparison with Ti (0.147 nm). \n\nWhen both Si and V are added to TiN, a synergetic effect of both elements are observed being \n\nthe diffraction peaks shifted to further higher diffraction angles. A detailed description of the \n\neffect of Si and V additions on the structure of TiN is shown in our previous work [10]. \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n194 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Typical X-ray diffraction patterns of the dissimilar coatings. \n\nTable 3 shows the hardness, Young\u00b4s Modulus, residual stress and scratch test critical \n\nload values of the coatings. V incorporation at the TiN and TiSiN systems slightly increased \n\nthe hardness and Young\u2019s modulus value of coatings. Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N coating exhibited the \n\nlowest hardness and Young\u00b4s modulus as compared to the other films, a consequence of the \n\nabove referred loss of crystallinity. Residual stresses were similar for all coatings \n\n(compressive; 3 \u2013 4 GPa) suggesting that the shift of TiN peaks to higher angles should be \n\nexclusively attributed to the presence of V and/or Si in solid solution. Moreover, by similar \n\nreasons, the small enhancement in the hardness achieved with V additions is probably due to \n\nsolid solution hardening. Similar correlations could be drawn for TiSiN system in comparison \n\nto TiN coating. In relation to the adhesion of films only two failure modes were observed on \n\nthe scratch tracks of the coatings: the first cracking (Lc1) and the first chipping (Lc2). Globally, \n\nall the coatings are well adherent to the substrate exhibiting high Lc values with Ti0.82V0.15N \n\nand Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N being better and worse performing, respectively. In general, Si \n\nincorporation in TiN system globally decreased the critical load values of the coatings.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 40 50 60 70 80\n\n36 37 38\n\nTiN (111)\n\nTiN (311)TiN (220)TiN (200)\n\nTiN (111)\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n I\nn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\n2 ?\n\nTi\n0.52\n\nSi\n0.20\n\nV\n0.14\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.65\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.75\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.03\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.80\n\nSi\n0.15\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.82\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN\n\nTiN\n\nTiN\n\nTi\n0.82\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.80\n\nSi\n0.15\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.75\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.03\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.65\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.52\n\nSi\n0.20\n\nV\n0.14\n\nN \n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\nv\ne\n\n I\nn\n\nte\nn\n\ns\nit\ny\n\n2 ?\n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n195 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nTable 3 \u2013Mechanical properties and residual stresses of the dissimilar coatings. \n\nSpecimen \n\nNano-\n\nhardness \n\n(GPa) \n\nYoung's Modulus \n\n(Gpa) \n\nResidual stresses \n\n(GPa) \n\nAdhesion critical loads (N)  \n\nFirst coating \n\ncracking Lc1 \n\nFirst chiping \n\nLc2 \n\nTiN 23.2 \u00b1 1.8 324 \u00b1 16 3.3  58.2\u00b1 1.4 > 70 \n\nTi0.82V0.15N 24 \u00b1 2 398 \u00b1 21 3.7  62.1\u00b1 1.2 > 70 \n\nTi0.80Si0.15N 27\u00b1 2 307 \u00b1 10  3.4 46.0 \u00b1 1.4 62.6\u00b1 1.1 \n\nTi0.75Si0.11V0.03N 27 \u00b1 3 327 \u00b1 15  3.7 55.2 \u00b1 1.1 64.6 \u00b1 1.1 \n\nTi0.65Si0.11V0.15N 28 \u00b1 2 328 \u00b1 7  4.1 53.6 \u00b1 1.3 64.8 \u00b1 1.3 \n\nTi0.52Si0.20V0.14N 26\u00b1 2 288 \u00b1 12  3.2 42.6 \u00b1 1.1 60.6 \u00b1 1.2 \n\n \n\n3.2 Tribological behaviour \n\n \n\n3.2.1 The wear rate of coatings and balls \n\n \n\nThe wear rate of coatings tested at room temperature were dependent on the \n\ncounterpart material, as shown in Figure 2. Generally, when Al2O3 balls were used as \n\ncounterparts, the wear rate of coatings was much lower compared to sliding against HSS steel \n\nballs. For reference coatings tested with Al2O3 balls, the tribological behaviour of TiN coating \n\nwas improved when vanadium was added; on the other hand, the addition of Si had a negative \n\neffect. As it will be shown later, there is a correlation between the wear rates and the cracking \n\ncritical load values of these coatings, which suggests a possible relationship with the fracture \n\ntoughness of the coatings and its influence on the wear debris production.  \n\nWhen Si and V were added simultaneously, V had predominant influence. In fact, any \n\nof the TiSiVN coatings showed lower wear rate than the TiN reference, with similar values to \n\nTi0.82V0.15N sample. It should be remarked that these coatings have, generally, similar Lc \n\nvalues as Ti0.82V0.15N, i.e. higher Lc than the ones measured for Ti0.80Si0.15N . A similar trend \n\nhas been observed for other nitride coating systems containing V [7, 14]. Besides the \n\ninfluence of V on the Lc values, the high wear resistance of V-rich coatings can also be \n\nattributed to the formation of V lubricious oxides on the wear track of coatings (see further \n\ndiscussion below). This can explain why Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N shows lower wear rate than TiN \n\n(and Ti0.80Si0.15N) in spite of its lower Lc value.  \n\nThe wear rate of the coatings increased significantly when tested against HSS balls, \n\nparticularly for the coatings where the V-rich lubricious oxide was identified during the \n\ncontact with Al2O3 balls. The lower hardness of HSS ball associated with an easier \n\nincrustation of hard wear debris in the sliding contact promoted abrasion of the wear track \n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n196 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nwith increasing wear rates. Limited formation of vanadium oxides led to higher friction \n\ncoefficient, more energy dissipated and more oxide particles in the wear track, as it will be \n\ndiscussed below. \n\nAs expected, the wear rate of the Al2O3 balls is much lower than that of softer HSS \n\nballs. Different trends were found between the wear rates of the coatings and the balls: (i) \n\nHSS ball wear rate increased when the coating wear decreased, and (ii) the wear rate of the \n\nAl2O3 balls was very low and almost constant for all the tests. In both cases, the ball surfaces \n\nwere covered with the wear debris; however, HSS balls show large areas with shallow \n\nscratches parallel to the movement of the ball and higher amount of adhered material. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - a) Wear rates of coatings tested against Al2O3 and HSS balls. b) Wear rates of Al2O3 and HSS \n\ncounterparts. \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14 Wear track\n\n Al\n2\nO\n\n3\n ball\n\n HSS ball\n\na)\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-6\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\n \nTiN Ti\n\n0.82\nV\n\n0.15\nN Ti\n\n0.80\nSi\n\n0.15\nN\n\nTi\n0.75\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.03\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.65\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.52\n\nSi\n0.20\n\nV\n0.14\n\nN\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8 Wear track\n\n Al\n2\nO\n\n3\n ball\n\n HSS ball\n\nb)\n\nW\ne\na\nr \n\nra\nte\n\n (\n1\n0\n\n-6\n m\n\nm\n3\n/N\n\n.m\n)\n\n \nTiN Ti\n\n0.82\nV\n\n0.15\nN Ti\n\n0.80\nSi\n\n0.15\nN\n\nTi\n0.75\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.03\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.65\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN\n\nTi\n0.52\n\nSi\n0.20\n\nV\n0.14\n\nN\n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n197 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n3.2.2 Friction coefficient \n\n \n\nFigure 3 a) and b) shows the friction coefficient of the coatings tested against Al2O3 \n\nand HSS balls, respectively. As the radius of the wear tracks used for Al2O3 and HSS balls \n\ntests were not the same and consequently, the sliding distances were different, the evolution \n\nof the friction coefficient is plotted as a function of the total number of cycles (5000 cycles). \n\nAll friction curves exhibited two stages: running-in and steady state. Generally, the coatings \n\nshowed lower friction coefficient values against Al2O3 showing thus similar trend to the wear \n\nrate. The highest friction coefficient was obtained for Ti0.80Si0.15N coating with values of 1.09 \n\nand 1.15 when tested against Al2O3 and HSS balls, respectively; it should be pointed out that \n\nthe wear rate was the highest as well. TiN coating presented also a high friction coefficient \n\nwhen tested against Al2O3 ball, with a large variation in the values with the number of cycles. \n\nAddition of Si and V had a significant impact on the frictional properties when Al2O3 \n\nball was used as a counterpart. Compared to Ti0.80Si0.15N, the friction dropped to one half \n\nwhen sufficient amount of vanadium was added and silicon content was kept low; the friction \n\nof Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N is below 0.5 being the lowest together with Ti0.82V0.15N coating. Testing \n\nwith HSS balls showed only limited influence of coating composition on the friction \n\ncoefficient. Again TiSiVN coatings exhibited the lowest friction, although it was only about \n\n10% lower than that of Ti0.80Si0.15N and similar to that of TiN. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Friction coefficient vs number of cycles of coatings tested against: a) Al2O3 balls, b) HSS steel balls. \n\n \n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n TiN                   Ti\n0.75\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.03\n\nN\n\n Ti\n0.82\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN        Ti\n0.65\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN\n\n Ti\n0.80\n\nSi\n0.15\n\nN        Ti\n0.52\n\nSi\n0.20\n\nV\n0.14\n\nN\n\na)\n\nF\nri\nc\nti\no\nn\n c\n\no\ne\nff\nic\n\nie\nn\nt\n\nNumber of cycles\n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n198 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 3 (continued).  \n\n3.2.3 Wear mechanisms: Sliding against Al2O3 balls \n\n \n\nThe changes in the friction coefficient and wear rates can be only partially correlated \n\nwith the structural and mechanical properties of the films. To identify the dominant wear \n\nmechanisms scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-\n\nEDS) was used to analyze the worn surfaces and the wear debris produced in the contact. \n\nTypical 2D profiles of the wear tracks of the coatings tested against Al2O3 are depicted in \n\nFigure 4 a). Profilometer measurements showed that with the addition of V to TiN and \n\nTi0.80Si0.15N coatings the wear track became shallower. Ti0.80Si0.15N and TiN showed the \n\ndeepest and widest wear tracks among all the coatings, which gave rise to their highest wear \n\nrates shown in Figure 2. The wear track of TiN coating was covered by fine scratches parallel \n\nto the relative sliding movement suggesting abrasion as the dominant wear mechanism. The \n\nscratches ended by the accumulation of the dragged material, which can well explain the \n\nfluctuations observed in the friction curve (Figure 5)). EDS analysis performed in the wear \n\ntrack revealed a mixture of as-deposited and oxidized coating material. Ti0.80Si0.15N coating \n\nshowed a similar wear mechanism as TiN; however, due to lower fracture toughness the worn \n\nparticles were larger and scratches deeper. The presence of large non-oxidized particles \n\noriginated from the coating led to an intensive abrasion of TiN and, particularly, Ti0.80Si0.15N \n\ncoating. \n\n \n\n \n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n TiN                   Ti\n0.75\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.03\n\nN\n\n Ti\n0.82\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN        Ti\n0.65\n\nSi\n0.11\n\nV\n0.15\n\nN\n\n Ti\n0.80\n\nSi\n0.15\n\nN        Ti\n0.52\n\nSi\n0.20\n\nV\n0.14\n\nN\n\nb)\n\nF\nri\nc\nti\no\nn\n c\n\no\ne\nff\nic\n\nie\nn\nt\n\nNumber of cycles\n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n199 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - 2D profiles of the wear track of coatings tested against: a) Al2O3, b) HSS. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Wear track of TiN film tested against Al2O3 ball. \n\nVanadium-containing coatings exhibited a different wear mechanism.

It should be remarked that all the other zones of the wear track showed EDS \n\nspectra identical to the as deposited films. After the test with Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N coating, the \n\nwear scar of the Al2O3 ball was covered with wear debris forming a transfer layer identified \n\nby EDS analysis as a mixture of V-O, Ti-O and Si-O oxides. Friction induced oxidation of \n\nwearing surfaces containing vanadium leading to formation of V-O, which acts as a solid \n\nlubricant in sliding contact [2, 7, 8]. In this study, thick tribolayer consisting mostly of \n\nvanadium oxide was indeed formed on the surface of Ti0.82V0.15N coating. However, addition \n\nof silicon had detrimental effect on tribolayer formation and function during the sliding \n\nprocess. It seems that Si somehow limits the formation of thick well-distributed tribolayer. \n\nThe higher wear rate and friction coefficient of Ti0.75Si0.11V0.03N in relation to \n\nTi0.65Si0.11V0.15N coating was in good accordance to the lower amount of \u201cvermicular\u201d debris \n\ndetected in the wear tracks. Although Ti0.82V0.15N and Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N showed similar V \n\ncontents, the higher amount of transfer layer was formed in the case of Ti0.82V0.15N. The role \n\nof Si is not clear, although it is possible that Si-O top layer hinders ion diffusion [15] and thus \n\nprotects the coating from oxidation required to form sufficient amount of lubricious vanadium \n\noxide.  \n\nThe worn surface of Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N film was found to be covered by fish-scale-like \n\nagglomerates along the worn surface indicating severe shear deformation of the tribofilm \n\nduring the sliding test [8]. EDS analysis suggested the presence of V-O, Si-O and Ti-O oxides \n\nin this zone. Additionally, EDS analysis showed significantly stronger peak of Si in relation to \n\nthe one found for the other TiSiVN films. Therefore, the oxide layer is dominated by Si-O. \n\nDue to low fracture toughness large wear debris particles are detached during the running-in \n\nstage; these particles are then either removed from the sliding contact (they were found on the \n\nside of the wear track) or oxidized forming adhered oxide layer both on coating and ball \n\nsurface. However, due to the strong shear force that the ball imposes to the coating, and the \n\nmore brittle nature of Si-O-rich oxide layer, a stick-slip adhesion process will take place, \n\ndeforming and breakage the wear debris and giving rise to the above referred fish-like aspect. \n\nTherefore, the tribological efficiency will be lower in this coating in relation to the other V-\n\ncontaining films due to the combined effect of: i) lower fracture toughness, ii) less lubricious \n\nV-O phase formed due the high Si content and iii) stick-slip adhesion wear mechanism. \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n201 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 SEM pictures of the wear track of: a) Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N coating tested against Al2O3 ball, b) \n\nTi0.52Si0.20V0.14N coating tested against Al2O3 ball, c) and d) magnification of the wear tracks of Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N \n\nand Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N coatings, respectively. \n\n3.2.4 Wear mechanisms: Sliding against HSS balls \n\n \n\nLow hardness of HSS balls compared to Al2O3 resulted in high ball wear and wide \n\nwear tracks (see Figure 4 b)). In fact, one might expect that hard coatings will resist much \n\nmore to sliding against relatively soft steel ball, whereas Al2O3 counterpart should induce \n\nsevere wear damage. However, Figure 2 and Figure 4 clearly indicate opposite behavior, i.e. \n\nhigher wear with HSS balls. \n\nReference TiN and Ti0.80Si0.15N coatings exhibited slightly different wear track \n\nappearance. Figure 7 shows the typical morphology of the worn surfaces of these coatings and \n\nthe corresponding wear scars of the balls. EDS analysis performed on the transfer layer of \n\nTiN coating, which was preferential formed in the central part of the wear track, evidenced \n\nmaterial transfer from the ball to the coating surface. The transfer layer thus consisted of \n\ntitanium and iron oxides. However, no oxygen was detected by EDS outside of the center part \n\nof unworn coating. Although the wear scars of the counterparts were covered with as-\n\nVermicular black\n\nwear debris\n\nFish-like\n\nwear debris\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\n5 \u00b5m\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\n20 \u00b5m\n\na) b)\n\nc) d)\n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n202 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\ndeposited and oxidized material from the coating for both TiN and Ti0.80Si0.15N coatings, the \n\nlatter exhibited higher material transfer to the HSS ball and, particularly, larger wear debris \n\nparticles. Hard non-oxidized particles embedded into compact adhered tribolayer act as sharp \n\ncutting edges causing abrasive damage and accelerating wear. On the other hand, relatively \n\nthick and well-adhered layer on the ball wear scar protected ball material from further \n\ndamage; thicker layer built during sliding against on Ti0.80Si0.15N resulted in lower ball wear \n\n(Figure 2 b)). It is clear here that higher amount of non-oxidized debris adhered on the ball \n\nprotects the ball itself but produces higher wear of the coating; the absence of well-developed \n\noxide layer on the coating surface is detrimental decreasing coating wear resistance. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Wear tracks induced by HSS ball sliding in: a) TiN coating, b) Ti0.80Si0.15N coating. Wear scar on \n\nHSS balls tested against: c) TiN coating, d) Ti0.80Si0.15N coating. \n\nAbsence of continuous tribolayer in the wear track was observed as well for the \n\ncoatings containing vanadium. Typical worn surfaces of the coatings (Ti0.82V0.15N and \n\nTi0.65Si0.11V0.15N) shown in Figure 8 were covered by stripes of adhered material, which \n\ncovered only small part of the wear tracks, see Figures 8 a) and b), indicating that the wear is \n\ndriven by a combination of adhesion and polishing wear. EDS analysis revealed that the \n\nstripes were composed of fully oxidized (i.e. no nitrogen observed) coating elements mixed \n\nTransfer\n\nlayer\n\n200 \u00b5m 200 \u00b5m\n\n400 \u00b5m 400 \u00b5m\n\na) b)\n\nc) d)\n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n203 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\nwith iron originating from the ball. Outside of the stripes no oxygen was identified by EDS. \n\nThe phenomenon of adhesive wear behaviour was believed to be a result of hard film and \n\nrelatively soft bearing ball [16]. Nevertheless, some of the V-O oxide present on the stripe \n\nzones should still provide a lubricious effect since a decrease of the wear rate with V \n\nincorporation is observed. This behaviour is enhanced in case of Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N coating \n\nwhere an even higher wear rate is observed; its lower fracture toughness, due to the higher \n\nsilicon content, constrains the V-O phase formation decreasing even more its content on the \n\nwear track. Ti0.82V0.15N film displayed the lowest wear rate of all the coatings due to the \n\nhigher amount of V-O oxide formed at the surface.  \n\nIn summary, we demonstrated that V additions successfully reduced the wear rate and \n\nfriction coefficient of TiSiN system; moreover we also showed that the tribological behaviour \n\nof films is strongly dependent on the counterpart material due to the presence of dissimilar \n\nwear mechanisms.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - SEM pictures of the wear track tested against HSS balls of: a) Ti0.82V0.15N coating, b) Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N \n\ncoating. c) and d) magnification of the wear tracks of Ti0.82V0.15N and Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N coatings, respectively. \n\n \n\n200 \u00b5m 200 \u00b5m\n\n20 \u00b5m 20 \u00b5m\n\na) b)\n\nc) d)\n\n\n\nAnnex I \n\n204 \nFilipe Daniel Fernandes \n\n4. Conclusion \n\n \n\nThe results showed that alloying TiSiN system with increasing V content improves the \n\nresistance to wear and decreases the friction coefficient; however, the tribological behaviour \n\nis strongly dependent of the counterbody ball material. SEM and Raman analysis revealed \n\nthat the influence of V was due to the formation of V-O lubricious oxide on the contact zone. \n\nWhen Al2O3 balls were used in the tests, the wear was driven by polishing wear and oxides \n\ncontaining V-O are spread all over the wear track. On the other hand, when tested against \n\nHSS balls, adhesion wear took place with material transfer from the ball to specific zones of \n\nthe wear track, being the lubricious effect of V-O significantly reduced. Ti0.80Si0.15N film \n\ndisplayed the lowest wear resistance among all the tested coatings due to its lower fracture \n\ntoughness which promotes the formation of bigger wear debris acting as strong abrasion \n\nplayers. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nThis research is sponsored by FEDER funds through the program COMPETE \u2013 Programa \n\nOperacional Factores de Competitividade \u2013 and by national funds through FCT \u2013 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npara a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia \u2013, under the project: PTDC/EME-TME/122116/2010, as well as \n\nthe grant (SFRH/BD/68740/2010). \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n[1] J.H.
