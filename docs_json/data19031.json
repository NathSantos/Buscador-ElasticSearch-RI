Seven male rabbits were used. Each animal received 3\nporous-surface implants in the left tibia and 3 rough-surface implants in the right tibia. The rabbits were sacrificed 4 weeks after surgery and\nfragments of the tibiae containing the implants were submitted to histological and histomorphometric analyses to evaluate new bone\nformation at the implant-bone interface. Means (%) of bone neoformation obtained in the histomorphometric analysis were compared by\nStudent\u2019s t-test for paired samples at 5% significance level.. The results of the histological analysis showed that osseointegration occurred\nfor both types of implants with similar quality of bone tissue. The histomorphometric analysis revealed means of new bone formation at\nimplant-bone interface of 79.69 \u00b1 1.00% and 65.05 \u00b1 1.23% for the porous- and rough-surface implants, respectively. Statistically\nsignificant difference was observed between the two types of implants with respect to the amount new bone formation (p<0.05). In\nconclusion, the porous-surface implants contributed to the osseointegration because they provide a larger contact area at implant-bone\ninterface.\nUniterms: Osseointegration; Implants; Porous: Rough; Surface; Bone.\n\n   prop\u00f3sito deste estudo foi avaliar a repara\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea ao redor de implantes de superf\u00edcie porosa comparados com implantes de\nsuperf\u00edcie rugosa, ambos confeccionados de tit\u00e2nio puro grau 2 por meio da t\u00e9cnica de metalurgia do p\u00f3.

They are considered ideal materials\nbecause they have shown better acceptability by human\ntissues than other metals under diverse circumstances16.\n\nThe high biocompatibility of titanium derives partially\nfrom the stable and protective oxide layer, which apparently\naids in connecting extracellular matrix to the implant surface16.\nThe knowledge of the biomaterial-bone tissue interface is\nextremely important to define which material would promote\na better tissue response and which kind of surface would be\nmore adequate for the proliferation of bone cells21. After\nplacement of an implant in the surgical cavity, several cellular\nevents take place. Ideally, these events should lead to wound\nhealing by intimate apposition of the bone to the biomaterial,\ni.e., osseointegration6. Osseointegration is a direct structural\nand functional connection between living bone and the\nsurface of an implant5.\n\nSurgical implants can be either cylindrical, conical or\nscrew-shaped12,25. Regardless of their external shape,\nmicroscopically they can present smooth, porous or textured\nsurfaces1,4,5,10,19,26. Several studies have shown that the\nsuccess or failure of surgical implants can be related to\nchemical3,12,19 and biological12 properties of their surfaces\nas well as to their micromorphology13,16,26. The differences\nin the microstructure of implant surfaces seem to influence\nstress distribution, bone retention, cellular response on its\nsurface and consequently the osseointegration3,12,23.\n\nThe porous surface has been considered as a good\nalternative to rough coating11. Biomaterials with porous\nstructure are aimed at optimizing the interfacial resistance\nbetween the material and the bone, leading to a more effective\nfixation of the implant. Porous implants allow an\ninterdigitation of the bone tissue to the implant, thus\nincreasing the interfacial resistance18. Additionally, a porous\nsurface provides a more efficient fixation, shorter initial\nhealing time19 and increased cellular adhesion potential.\nOtherwise, screw implants with rough surface present only\njuxtaposition of bone11,12,21. Porous implants have been\ndeveloped to be stabilized by bone ingrowth into the\npores11,19. Pilliar, et al.19 (1998) reviewed and compared several\ndesigns and surfaces of surgical implants and concluded\nthat the surface with pores of 100 \u00b5m in diameter would be\nideal for the neoformation of a three-dimensional\nosseointegration net inside the implant. Oliveira, et al.18\n(2002) determined that, although the fabrication process\nparameters have been optimized, the ideal porous\nrequirements for surgical implants have not yet been\nreached. These authors reported that some changes are\nnecessary in order to increase porosity and advocated that\nan analysis of pore size distribution along the sample has\nbeen performed to indicate more efficiently which porous\nfraction would better meet implant requirements17.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze, by\nhistological and histomorphometric methods, the bone\n\nrepair around cylindrical grade-2 commercially pure titanium\nimplants with rough and porous surface, fabricated using\npowder metallurgy technique, after their insertion in tibiae\nof rabbits.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSeven male New Zealand albino rabbits aged 6 to 8 months\nand weighing 3.5 kg on average were used in this study. The\nanimals were provided by the Vivarium of S\u00e3o Jose dos Campos\nDental School and were kept in individual cages and fed a\ncommercial pet chow (Coelhil R; Socil, Belo Horizonte, MG,\nBrazil) and water ad libitum.\n\nThe commercially pure titanium implants with either rough\nor porous surface were fabricated at the Department of\nMaterials of the Air and Space Institute at CTA (Brazilian Air\nand Space Technical Center, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, SP, Brazil)\nin an association with the National Institute of Technology\nof Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). The implants had\n3.0 mm in diameter and pore diameters ranging from 250 and\n350 \u00b5m.\n\nThe implants were cleaned, wrapped and sterilized in\nautoclave at 121\u00b0C for 15 min. Prior to surgery, the animals\nwere weighed and injected intramuscularly with 13 mg/kg of\naqueous solution of 2% hydrochloride of 2-(2,6-xylidine)-5,6-\ndihydro-4H-1,3-thiazin (Rompum; Bayer, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil),\nwhich is an analgesic, sedative and muscular relaxant\nsubstance. General anesthesia was obtained with\nadministration of 33 mg/Kg of ketamine (Dopalen; Agribrands\ndo Brasil Ltda, Paulinia, SP, Brazil).). A local anesthetic\ncomposed of 3% octapressin combined with prilocaine\nhydrochloride and felypressin (3%Citanest R \u2013 Dentsply) was\nalso used.\n\nThe implant was removed from the wrap, placed in the\nperforation and pressed into the surgical cavity until it was\nfixed to the cortical bone. In order to standardize the procedure,\nthe right tibia received a rough surface implant (control) group,\nwhile the left tibia received a porous-surface implant. The\nmuscular tissue was sutured with absorbable thread and the\nskin with mononylon 4-0 surgical thread. After that, all animals\nwere given penicillin and were monitored until sacrifice 30\ndays after surgery.\n\nAfter euthanasia, the surgical segments with the implants\nwere removed and the implants were tested for mobility using\na clinical clamp. The segments were placed in 10% formalin\nsolution for at least 48 h.\n\nNext, the specimens were dehydrated in an increasing\nethanol series (50%, 75%, 90% and 100%), embedded in\npolyester resin (Orto cristal T 208; Valglass com. e ind. Ltda.\nS\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil) and sectioned longitudinally in a\nsectioning machine for hard tissues (Labcut 1010; Extec\nTechnologies, Inc., Enfield, CT, USA) providing 80-\u00b5m-thick\nserial sections on average. The sections were ground in a\npolishing machine (Labpol 8-12; Extec Technologies, Inc.)\nusing sandpapers of decreasing abrasiveness (#400, #600\nand #1200) until reaching a thickness of 30-40 \u00b5m. The cuts\nwere analyzed under optical microscopy and scanning electron\n\n214\n\nHISTOMORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PURE TITANIUM IMPLANTS WITH POROUS SURFACE VERSUS ROUGH SURFACE\n\n\n\nmicroscopy (SEM). Images were taken with a digital camera\n(DSC-S85, Cyber-shot, Sony) coupled to the optical\nmicroscope and evaluated on a television monitor (Panasonic).\n\nThree sections of each implant were evaluated for the\npercentage of bone neoformation at implant-bone interface.\nTwo areas of each section were digitized (X100), representing\nthe medial and distal interfaces of the implant. Therefore, 124\nsections were analyzed for each type of implant. Bone\nneoformation rate and bone ingrowth into the pores were\ncalculated using the Image J software (NIH, USA). The final\ndata were submitted to statistical analysis using the Minitab\nsoftware version 12.3 (Minitab Inc, USA) and Student\u2019s t-\ntest at 5% significance level.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAll animals presented satisfactory postoperative results,\nwithout any evidence of inflammation or infection of the\nsurgical site. No adverse reaction was observed during the\nprocedure. During the clinical evaluation, performed with a\nclinical clamp, none of the implants presented mobility.\n\nIn both groups (rough- and porous-surface implants),\nthere was bone neoformation around the implant leading to\nosseointegration (Figures 1 and 2). This new bone formation\nwas similar in both groups and was constituted by mature\nbone trabeculae that presented lamellar arrangement and by\nmedullar spaces of different sizes. In several specimens,\nregardless of the analyzed group, bone neoformation above\nthe implants and at their bottom surface was observed,\nsometimes contacting the internal cortical face on the opposite\nside. A clear delimitation between the new bone formation\nand the preexistent cortical bone was also noticed (Figures 3,\n4 and 5).\n\nThe results showed that the types of implant used\npresented statistically significant difference to each other\nregarding the amount of new bone formation on the implant-\nbone interface, the porous-surface implants showing a larger\namount neoformed bone. Table 1 shows the means of bone\nneoformation (%) at bone-implant interface of rough- vs.\nporous-surface implants.\n\nFIGURE 1- SEM micrograph of a cylindrical implant with\nporous surface ( ); bone ( ); bone-implant interface ( ).\n(Original magnification X50)\n\nFIGURE 2- SEM micrograph of a cylindrical implant with\nrough surface ( ); bone ( ); bone-implant interface ( ).\n(Original magnification X50).\n\nFIGURE 3- SEM micrograph showing a panoramic view of\na cylindrical implant with porous surface ( ) inserted into\nrabbit tibia ( ); osseointegration at the bottom of the\nimplant ( ).

The results showed no difference of new bone quality\nbetween both types of implants. However, when the quantity\nof bone neoformation at implant-bone interface was\nevaluated, a larger formation of bone tissue was observed\nfor the porous-surface implants, and this difference was\nstatistically significant.\n\nThe most important factors to dental implant\nosseointegration are related to the characteristics of its\nsurfaces, which include topography and chemical and\nelectric properties of the material19, since bone-implant\ninteraction is mainly related to the most external layers of\nthe implants13. Important factors to a more successful\nosseointegration are: implant material, implant shape,\nsurgical technique20, quantity of bone tissue20,25, load6 and\nimplant resistance4. However, some other factors such as\nsurface energy, sterilization techniques and chemical and\ntopographic properties of the implant surface are extremely\nimportant for the final outcome of osseointegration2,8,12,16.\n\nIn the present study, the results showed that all implants\nwere well tolerated when placed in rabbit tibiae, thus\ncorroborating the findings of previous studies that indicated\ntitanium as the best biomaterial for surgical implants15,16.\n\nBone growth is also dependent on factors such as\npercentage of surface porosity, stability and degree of\nmicromovement of the implant and the presence of gaps\nbetween the implant and the bone at the time of placement.\nImplants placed under pressure inside the surgical cavity\nhelp minimizing the gaps and implant micromovement8.\nTherefore, in order to obtain osseointegration, the surgical\ncavity must be prepared with the least injury possible15,20.\nIn order to cause minimal damage to the surrounding bone\ntissues, in the present study, bone perforation was performed\nusing burs of increasingly larger diameters,, and under\nconstant saline irrigation. After that, the implants were gently\n\npressed into the surgical cavity, which diminished the gap\nbetween the implant and the bone and promoted efficient\nstability. Additionally, all implants were evaluated with a\nclinical clamp at the moment of sacrifice, 30 days after surgery,\nand were stable.\n\nSome previous studies used a 4-week healing period to\nevaluate the biocompatibility of metal materials7,14,17,22.\nDeporter, et al.10 (1986) reported that healing periods (i.e.,\nbetween implant placement and euthanasia of the animals)\nlonger than 4 weeks added no benefits to increase the\nquantity of bone tissue ingrowth into porous-surface\nimplants, and observed that only bone tissue maturation\ntook place after this period. Thus, in the present study, a 4-\nweek period was used to evaluate the biocompatibility of\nporous-surface grade 2 commercially pure titanium implants\nfabricated by means of powder metallurgy technique.\n\nThe purpose of studying and developing porous-surface\nimplants is to promote a more stable and biocompatible\nfixation of titanium implants. The creation of a porous\ngeometry surface aims not only at increasing contact area\nbut also at allowing bone ingrowth into the pores, including\nthose located more centrally. Such ingrowth is due to pore\nintercommunication, which produces a three-dimensional\nnet and allows a mechanical entanglement 7,8,9,18.\n\nThe porous-surface implant have an ideal diameter for\nthe proliferation of bone cells2,12, and most studies report\nthat pore diameter ranges from 100 to 400 \u00b5m. In addition,\nthe pores have been shown to be interconnected, so that\nbone interdigitation into the porous structure may occur,\nthus reaching maximum interfacial resistance18,24. However,\nNguyen, et al.17 (2004) reported that small pores measuring\nonly 45 \u00b5m in diameter also allow bone ingrowth. Furthermore\nFrosch, et al.14 (2002) found that 300 to 600 \u00b5m pores showed\na three-dimensional, reticular osteoblast-like cell\ndevelopment within 4 weeks, and that in 1000 \u00b5m pores cell\ningrowth was incomplete. In the present study, the diameter\nof the pores varied between 250 and 350 \u00b5m, corroborating\nthe findings of other studies9,19,23.\n\nSvehla, et al.23 (2000) compared five different implant\nsurfaces and verified that porous surfaces promoted an\nexcellent substrate for the ingrowth of bone tissue and\n\nStatistical Analysis     Implant surface\n     Porous      Rough\n\nMean \u00b1 SD 79.69 \u00b1 1.00 65.05 \u00b1 1.23\nDifference 14.64\n\nt (df) 32.75\np value 0.0001*\n\nCI (95%) 13.54 to 15.73\n\nTABLE 1- Means of bone neoformation (%) at bone-implant\ninterface for rough-surface and porous-surface implants.\nResult of the Student\u2019s t-test\n\n*statistically significant difference.\n\nFIGURE 5- SEM micrograph of a cylindrical implant with\nrough surface ( ); bone interface ( ); delimitation between\nthe new bone formation and the preexistent cortical bone\n( ).

In the present study, when the cylindrical porous-\nsurface implants were compared to the cylindrical rough-\nsurfaces implants, osseointegration was observed in both\ngroups. No formation of fibrous tissue was observed at\nbone-implant interface. However, significantly more bone\nformation was observed in the porous-surface implants.\n\nDeporter, et al.11 (1990) concluded that a smaller segment\nof porous-surface implants allowed a more effective contact\nwith the bone, due to a bigger contact area, determined by\nits topography. Similar findings were observed in the present\nstudy in which a statistically significant difference was\nobserved between the groups in relation to the quantity of\nbone neoformation at titanium-bone interface. Therefore,\nsmaller porous-surface implants could be developed to be\nused in complex clinical situations such as regions with\nlow-quality bone9,19.\n\nThe results of this study showed that because of the\nlarger contact surface promoted by the presence of pores,\nthere was more bone ingrowth on the implant-bone interface.\nSuch results are consistent with those of Cook and Rust-\nDawicki7 (1995), Deporter, et al.9 (2002), Deporter, et al.10 (1986),\nDeporter, et al.11 (1990), Frosch, et al.14 (2002), Karabuda, et\nal.15 (1999), Story, et al.22 (1998), Svehla, et al.23 (2000), Vidigal\nJunior, et al.25 (1999), Zinger, et al.26 (2005) who also observed\nmore effectiveness of the porous-surface implants compared\nto other types of implants.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBased on the results of this study, it may be concluded\nthat the cylindrical porous-surface implants yielded greater\nbone neoformation than the cylindrical rough-surface\nimplants because of their larger area in contact with the\nbone tissue and the presence of an intercommunicating\nporous structure that allowed the formation of a three-\ndimensional osseointegration network.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1- Bagno A, Bello CD.
