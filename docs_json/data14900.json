A escolha da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o \nelectrofor\u00e9tica de entre os v\u00e1rios processos de fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes espessos \nprende-se com as caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas desta t\u00e9cnica, nomedamente, elevada \nflexibilidade e simplicidade para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o a v\u00e1rios materiais e combina\u00e7\u00e3o de \nmateriais, possibilidade de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o a uma gama variada de formas e \nestruturas tridimensionais complexas, densas e porosas e a capacidade de ser \nutilizada \u00e0 escala industrial a baixos custos. \nNeste trabalho foi seguida uma aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o sistem\u00e1tica para a fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o dos \nfilmes espessos comp\u00f3sitos pr EPD. Primeiramente procedeu-se \u00e0 s\u00edntese de \np\u00f3s monof\u00e1sicos de  BLT e BNT pelo processo convencional de reac\u00e7\u00e3o no \nestado s\u00f3lido e a sua pureza foi confirmada por an\u00e1lises de Difrac\u00e7\u00e3o de Raios \nX. O tamanho e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho e a morfologia dos p\u00f3s de BLT e BNT \nforam caracterizados por recurso a t\u00e9cnicas de determina\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho de \npart\u00edcula e microscopia electr\u00f3nica de varrimento. De seguida foram \npreparadas suspens\u00f5es dos p\u00f3s de BNT e BLT em diferentes meios \nsuspensores, como \u00e1gua, etanol e trietanolamina. Ao mesmo tempo, foi \nestudada a estabilidade das suspens\u00f5es por an\u00e1lises de tamanho de part\u00edcula \ne  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nmedidas de transmit\u00e2ncia de luz UV. As suspens\u00f5es com estabilidade \noptimizada foram utilizadas para deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes espessos, em meio \nb\u00e1sico e meio \u00e1cido e foram estudadas as vari\u00e1veis de processamento, como \nespessura, massa do dep\u00f3sito, corrente el\u00e9ctrica em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo e \nvoltagem. Foi tamb\u00e9m discutido o efeito do passo de prensagem isost\u00e1tica, \nap\u00f3s deposi\u00e7\u00e3o, na morfologia e densidade dos filmes e tamb\u00e9m na sua \nresposta diel\u00e9ctrica. \n\nFilmes de BLT de 10 mm de espessura depositados sobre folhas de \nplatina e sinterizados a 1600\u00baC/1h exibem ?r = 58, TC?r +30ppm/\u00baC e perda \ndiel\u00e9ctrica de 0.002 a 1 MHz. Como termo de compara\u00e7\u00e3o foram preparados \ncer\u00e2micos de BLT. Foi feita a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o estrutural, microestrutural e \ndiel\u00e9ctrica de filmes e cer\u00e2micos de BLT, sinterizados entre 1400\u00baC e 1600\u00baC. \n\nFilmes espessos comp\u00f3sitos de BNT/BLT e BLT/BNT foram \npreparados com sucesso por EPD. Atrav\u00e9s da combina\u00e7\u00e3o de camadas de \nBLT e BNT foram preparados filmes espessos comp\u00f3sitos de 30 \u00b5m com ?r \n~71, TC?r ~-16ppm/\u00baC e perda diel\u00e9ctrica de a 1 MHz. Estes resultados s\u00e3o de \nparticular relev\u00e2ncia visto que combinam a possibilidade de preparar filmes \nespessos com propriedades desenhadas para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es a frequ\u00eancias \nelevadas e das microondas com a capacidade de diminuir o tamanho do \ndispositivo. Embora preliminares estes resultados abrem novas oportunidades \ntecnol\u00f3gicas, que dever\u00e3o ser mais exploradas. \n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nMicrowave Material, Electrophoretic Deposition, Composites, BLT, BNT, High \nQ, Microelectronics, Microwave Material \n\nabstract \n\n \nWireless communications have experienced an exceptional growth in \n\nthe last decades and similar growth is expected for next coming years, \naccording to the ABI analysis [Chapter 1, Reference 3]. With this growth there is \nan increase demand for the production of devices of smaller dimensions and \nmore flexible than the current in use ones, with increased integration, possibility \nof operation at high frequencies and produced with reduced costs. There is also \na present demand to develop materials with relative permittivity (?r) between 40 \n- 80, low loss and near zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (tf). \nResearch activities to exploit thin and thick film technologies to replace the bulk \nceramics are currently underway. \n\nWithin this context, in this work, the fabrication of thick films by \nelectrophoretic deposition of the tertiary compound BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) was \nexploited, because of the optimal properties for microwave applications of BLT. \nSimultaneously, the preparation of BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) - Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) \ncomposite thick films was attempted to fill the permittivity gap of 40-80 as \ndescribe above. The choice of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique over \nother thick film processing techniques is obvious because of its unique features, \nsuch as the high flexibility and simplicity for application with various materials \nand combinations of materials, and on a wide range of shapes and 3D complex \nand porous structures, and its ability to be scaled-up to the fabrication of large \nproduct volumes and sizes at low costs.  \nA systematic approach was used to fabricate the composite thick films. Firstly, \nBLT and BNT powders were prepared by solid state reaction synthesis and the \nphase purity of the powders was confirmed by XRD. The size and morphology \nof the powders were assessed by particle size analysis and scanning electron \nmicroscopy. BNT and BLT suspensions were prepared in different suspension \nmedia such as water, ethanol and acetone. The pH of the suspension was \nvaried by dilute nitric acid and triethanolamine. Concomitantly the stability of the \nsuspensions was characterised by particle size analysis and UV transmittance \nmeasurements. Stable suspensions were used for the deposition of particles in \nacidic and basic conditions, and the processing parameters such as thickness, \ndeposit weight, current as a function of time and voltage were studied. The \neffect of iso static pressing and film thickness on the properties and morphology \nwas also discussed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n 10 mm thick BLT films on platinum foils and sintered at 1600\u00baC/1h \nexhibit ?r = 58, TC?r +30ppm/\u00baC and loss tangent 0.002 at 1 MHz. As a \ncomparison tool, BLT ceramics were prepared as well. Films and ceramics \nwere sintered between 1400\u00baC to 1600\u00baC and their morphology and dielectric \nresponse assessed.  \n  BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT composite thick films were successfully \nprepared by electrophoretic deposition. By the combination of BLT and BNT \nlayers a 30 \u00b5m composite thick film with ?r ~71, TC?r ~-16ppm/\u00baC and loss \ntangent of 0.002 at 1 MHz were prepared. These results are of particular \nrelevance since they combine the possibility to prepare thick films with tailored \nproperties for high frequency and microwave properties with the aptitude to \ndecrease the device size. Although preliminary these results open further \ntechnological opportunities, that should be more explored \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nList of Figures \n\nList of Table \n\nList of Symbols \n\nList of Abbreviations \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\n \n\nChapter 1.

Microwave \n\ndevices have application in terminals, base station, satellite and mobile phones. With the \n\ngrowth of telecommunication, demand is also increased for material with higher relative \n\npermittivity for miniaturization of the existing devices. \n\n This chapter reviews the sequential evaluation of the dielectric ceramics and the \n\nproperties to the corresponding materials. BaO-R2O3-TiO2(BRT) (R = rare earth element) \n\nsystem belong  to the family of high relative permittivity materials with low losses and \n\nshow the potential to scaled down the existing microwave devices in thick film. From BRT \n\nfamily the two compounds selected for this studies are Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54(BNT) and \n\nBaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT). The literature review of these compounds are illustrated and chapter \n\nends with the description of microwave material application  \n\n \n\n1.1 Introduction  \n\nThe term microwave refers to electromagnetic energy having a frequency higher \n\nthan 1 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second) and materials which shows resonance at \n\nthis frequency are known as microwave resonators. Microwave signals propagate in \n\nstraight lines and they are not or very little affected by troposphere, ionized regions in the \n\nupper atmosphere and barriers such as hills, mountains, and large human-made structures. \n\n \n\nMost microwave systems operate in the 300 MHz to 30 GHz range of frequency in \n\nelectromagnetic (EM) spectrum. For telecommunications, the most important markets are \n\nultra-high frequency TV broadcasting (470 - 870MHz), satellite TV broadcasting (4 GHz) \n\nand the mobile phone network (900 MHz - 1800 MHz) [1]. In terms of devices, the \n\nmicrowave market is dominated by the bulky invar coaxial and cavity resonators which \n\nhave 3 times lower cost then neodymium (Nd) and tantalum (Ta) based ceramics. \n\nNeodymium and tantalum based resonators are used where high quality factor (Qf) is \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nneeded. In the last three decades, the discovery and development of the \n\ntelecommunications and associated devices created a new era to ceramics and in particular \n\nto dielectric ceramics which have edge on the bulky metal resonators because of there low \n\nweight and possibility of miniaturisation. Today, dielectric ceramics are having key \n\napplications in resonators, filters and other components in microwave communication \n\nsystems. Still there are various challenges for the new generation of microwave ceramics to \n\nbe achieve, namely to reduce dielectric losses, to optimise the device design, to reduce the \n\nsize (miniaturization) and to further lower the cost of ceramics resonators and filters. \n\n  \n\nThe global market for the dielectric ceramics is of the order of $400 million; while \n\nthe markets for the resulting devices and components, and for the end-user systems, are \n\n~10 and ~100 times that size, respectively [2]. At the time of economic recession the only \n\nsector which is untouched by recession is telecommunication. A recent survey by ABI \n\nResearch has predicted that mobile services revenues will continue to grow at nearly 1.2% \n\nthrough 2014 (Figure 1-1) [3].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1-1: World mobile telecommunication revenue for next five years [3]. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nAt the present, commercial microwave ceramics fall into two main categories: (i) \n\nceramics with low dielectric permittivity, ?r  (20 &lt;?r &lt;45) and quality factor (Qf) \n\n(100,000-20,000GHz) and (ii) ceramics with high ?r (>80) and moderate quality factor (Qf) \n\n(10,000GHz) [1].  \n\n \n\nThe three main prerequisites which make dielectric ceramic materials suitable for \n\nthe microwave applications are: \n\n? High Quality factor (Qf) or low dielectric loss (tan ?) \n\n? High relative permittivity (?r ) \n\n? Near zero Temperature coefficient of thermal stability (tf) \n\n \n\n1.1.1 Relative Permittivity \n\nPermittivity is a physical quantity that describes how an electric field affects, and is \n\naffected by a dielectric medium, and is determined by the ability of a material to polarize \n\nin response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material [4]. \n\n \n\nThe overall net polarization experienced in a material, P, creates a dipole moment \n\nwhich augments the total displacement flux of dipoles, D. Thus, \n\n                                                           D = ?0 E+ P                                                        (1-1) \n\nwhere E stands for the applied field and ?0 for the permittivity of free-space. And the net \n\npolarization can be written in terms of the susceptibility, ?, \n\n                                                           P = ?0 ? E                                                         (1-2) \n\nthus the relative permittivity can be defined in terms of the susceptibility that is directly \n\nrelated to the polarization mechanisms in a material: \n\n                                                         D = ?0 (1+?) E= ?r ?0 E                                       (1-3) \n\nwhere \n\n                                                        ?r = \n0\n\n?\n\n?\n = relative permittivity                           (1-4) \n\n \n\nThe relative permittivity, ?r, is then the ratio of the natural permittivity of the \n\nmaterial (?) to the permittivity of free-space (?0). The permittivity, ?, is considered to be a \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\ndirect measure of the polarizability of a material and will govern both the phase variation \n\nand attenuation of an imposed field to the material. Thus, the permittivity, ?, is a complex \n\nquantity with both real and imaginary parts and can be written as, \n\n                                                          ? = ?\n? \n+ j ?\n\n?\n                                                  (1-5) \n\nthe real part of the relative permittivity, ?\n?\n, is termed the dielectric constant and is \n\ndetermined by the magnitude of P. It defines the amount of electrostatic energy stored per \n\nunit volume in a material for a given applied field, i.e. the amount of charge stored in a \n\ncapacitor. The imaginary component of the permittivity, ?\n?\n, is called the loss factor and is \n\ngoverned by the lag in polarization upon application of the field and the energy dissipation \n\nassociated with charge polarization. It represents the energy loss in a material; j is a \n\ncomplex number [5].  \n\n \n\n A high relative permittivity is desirable for circuit miniaturisation, because \n\ndiameter of dielectric component is inversely proportional to the square root of its relative \n\npermittivity, so higher the permittivity smaller the size of microwave resonator. \n\n                                                        d=?0?\nr\n\n?\n\n1\n                                      (1-6) \n\nwhere d stands for the diameter of the dielectric component, and ?0 for the wavelength at \n\nthe resonant frequency [6]. As a consequence, the size reduction of a dielectric component \n\nrequires materials with a high relative permittivity.  \n\n \n\n1.1.2 Loss Tangent \n\n The loss tangent, tan?, relates to the electrical losses in the material and is given by: \n\n \n\n                                                      \n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n?tan                              (1-7) \n\nwhere ? stands for loss angle, ? ?? for the energy loss and ?? for the stored energy. In terms \n\nof an electrical circuit, tan? represents the resistive part of the impedance and is directly \n\nproportional to the electrical conductivity [4].  \n\nThe quality factor, Q is defined by: \n\n                                             Q = 1/tan ?                                                         (1-8)  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nand it is a measure of the efficiency or power-loss of a microwave system. This definition \n\nis not particularly useful for visualizalizing how Q relates to microwave communication. \n\nMore succinctly, it is determined experimentally at the resonance frequency (fo) divided by \n\nthe bandwidth, (?fo), measured at 3dB below the maximum height at resonance [7]. Q is a \n\nmeasure of the selectivity of the resonator to a given frequency. Higher Q means a narrow \n\npeak which results in reduced risk of cross-talk within a given frequency range, which in \n\nturn gives high selectivity to a given frequency and therefore increase the density of \n\nchannels in a given frequency band. Losses normally increase with increasing frequency; \n\ntherefore Q is also frequency dependent. The relation between the two, Qf, where f is the \n\nmeasured frequency is always constant so, Qf values are quoted when comparing low loss \n\n(high Q) dielectric microwave ceramics [7].  \n\n \n\n1.1.3 Temperature Coefficient of Resonant Frequency (tf) \n\nThe temperature coefficient of resonance frequency (tf) is the parameter which \n\ncharacterises the thermal stability of the material. It measures the ?drift? with respect to the \n\ntemperature of the resonant frequency [4]. \n\n                                                      tf = \n0\n\nf\n\nf?\n?\n\nT?\n\n1\n                            (1-9) \n\nwhere f0 stands for the resonant frequency at ambient temperature and ?f for the frequency \n\nvariation among the temperature range ?T.  Conventionally, tf specifies the resonant \n\nfrequency change in parts per million per degrees centigrade (ppm/\no\nC). The poor \n\ntemperature stability would cause the in and out drift of resonance of the carrier signal \n\nduring hot and cold days. The practical requirement is that for a temperature ranging \n\nbetween -40\u00baC and 100\u00ba, tf should vary less then 10ppm/\u00baC [8]. \n\n \n\nTemperature coefficient of resonant frequency (tf) is related with the temperature \n\ncoefficient of the dielectric constant, TC?r, by the following relation:  \n\n                                                       tf = -1/2 TC?r \u2013 ?                                                (1-10)  \n\n \n\n where ? stands for the thermal expansion coefficient of the material [9]. TC?r describes the \n\nmaximum change in relative permittivity over a specified temperature range. tf is \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\ndepending on the TC?r, which is typically reported between -2000 to 2000 ppm/\u00baC in \n\ndielectric materials [8]. This is the stringent restriction for the material with higher \n\ndielectric constant to be used for microwave systems. Wersing [6] related the TC?r with \n\npolarizability and further with the structure to give a clear picture of the TC?r variation in \n\ndifferent structures and conditions. The large TC?r of diatomic alkali halide is obviously \n\ncaused by the strong increase of the ionic polarization with volume and by the large \n\nthermal expansion with the increase of the temperature. In materials with more \n\ncomplicated structures, BaMg1/3Ta2/3O3, BaZn1/3Ta1/3O3, the additional ionic polarizability \n\nnot only raises permittivity but also shifts TC?r to negative values. Both strong electronic \n\nand ionic polarizabilities also give rise to a softening of the lattice modes, thus the \n\nanharmonic contribution to TC?r increases and makes TC?r even more negative. This \n\ndecrease of TC?r with increasing permittivity is consistent with the behaviour of \n\nparaelectrics [6]. \n\n \n\n1.2 Important Groups of Microwave Ceramics \n\nMicrowave dielectric ceramics are characterized by high ?r, low loss (high Q), and \n\nnear zero tf, making them attractive as electronic components in microwave applications, \n\nas mentioned previously. In the mid-1960s, Cohn and his co-workers performed the first \n\nextensive theoretical and experimental evaluation of the low loss dielectric resonators [10], \n\nbased on rutile (TiO2) ceramics. The poor temperature stability of rutile dielectrics \n\nprevented the development of practical components for commercial applications. A real \n\nbreakthrough occurred in the earlies 1970s when BaTi4O9 based ceramics full filled the \n\ntechnical requirement, with ?r ~38, tf =15ppm/\u00baC. and Q=5000 at 2GHz [11]. Later, a \n\nmodified Ba2Ti9O20 with improved performance was reported by Bell Laboratories having \n\n?r ~40, tf = 2 ppm/\u00baC and Q= 15000 at 2GHz [10]. The next major breakthrough came from \n\nJapan when the Murata Manufacturing Company produced (Zr0.8Sn0.2)TiO4 ceramics [12-\n\n13-14], which offers adjustable compositions so that the temperature coefficient could be \n\nvaried between 10 to 12 ppm/\u00b0C. A list of important groups of dielectrics and their \n\nproperties is tabulated in Table 1-1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nTable 1-1: Important groups of microwave ceramics [6].  \n\nCeramics \n\nRelative \n\npermittivity \n\n(?r) \n\ntf(ppm/\u00baC) \n\nQuality \n\nfactor(Q) \n\nAt 2 GHz \n\nQuality \n\nfactor(Q) \n\nAt 20 GHz \n\nBa2Ti9O20 40 2 15 000 2000 \n\nZr0.8TiSn0.2O4 38 10-12 15 000 3000 \n\nBaTiu[(NixZn1-x)1/3Ta2/3]1-u O3 30 -3-+3 26 000 5000 \n\nBa[Snx(Mg1/3Ta2/3)1-x]O3 25 ~0 >40 000 10 000 \n\nNd2O3-BaO-TiO2.Bi2O3 ~90 ~0 3 000 - \n\nBiNdO4 ~40 ~30 4 000 - \n\n \n\nThe commercially available microwave ceramic compounds generally categories in \n\nto two groups; titanium based and tantalum based. Table 1-2 summarises the dielectric \n\nproperties of commercial available microwave resonators for MW Ceramics with almost \n\nzero tf. CaTiO3-NdAlO3 (CTNA) and ZrTiO4-ZnNd2O6 (ZNZN)- based ceramics are \n\ndominating the base station market. Ba(Co,Zn)1/3Nd2/3O3(BCZN)-based ceramics are the \n\nmost cheapest material for MW cavity resonators with high Qf of 90 000 [7]. Tantalum \n\nbased compounds are used when there is the need of high Qf materials.  Ba(Mg1/3 Ta2/3)O3 \n\n(BMT) and Ba(Zn1/3 Ta2/3)O3 are mainly used in satellites where selectivity to a given \n\nfrequency is paramount. The presence of Ta makes this compound very costly for \n\napplications. The researchers are currently working on understanding the role of Ta, so that \n\nit could be replaced by low cost material. The ceramics based on Nd2O3 (or La2O3), BaO \n\nand TiO2 were already quite common for capacitors with an almost temperature \n\nindependent capacitance and now found importance in microwave application; they are \n\nknown to be \u00b4high ?r\u00b4 microwave ceramics [6]. Within this family Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) \n\ncompound has a tungsten bronze structure with high permittivity of 80 and is commercially \n\nused as digital television receiver and could be used as dielectric resonator antennas and \n\ncoaxial line resonator where Q is dominated by the metallization. Two decades ago, the \n\nBanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n (BLT) homologous series was found near the Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54(R= \n\nrare Earth). In this series the compound BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT, n=1) has high relative \n\npermittivity ~44, with high Qf 47 000 GHz and tf near to zero (-2ppm/\u00baC). This material \n\nhas optimal properties to be used as in telecommunication base stations. \n\n \n\nIn this work, the fabrication and properties of BNT and BLT dielectric thick films \n\nand thick film composite were exploited and it was verified that thick films present optimal \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nproperties to be used as antennas, filters and other microwave application, in which \n\nminiaturization is required. \n\n \n\nTable 1-2: Commercial available dielectric ceramics for cavity resonator for MW application with \n\nalmost zero temperature coefficients of resonant frequency tf [7]. \n\n \n\nMaterial Abbreviation ?r Qf (GHz) \n\nBaMg1/3Ta2/3O3 BMT 24 250 000 \n\nBaZn1/3Ta2/3O3 BZT 29 150 000 \n\nBa(Co,Zn)1/3Nd2/3O3 BCZN 34 90 000 \n\nSrTiO3-LaAlO3 STLA 39 60 000 \n\nCaTiO3-NdAlO3 CTNA 45 48 000 \n\nZrTiO4-ZnNd2O6 ZTZN 44 48 000 \n\nBa4Nd9.33Ti18O54 BNT 80 10 000 \n\n \n\n1.3 BaO-Nd2O3-TiO2 (BNT)  \n\nInterest has spread quickly to rare earth elements, BaO-R2O3-TiO2 systems (R = \n\nrare earth, such as La, Sm, Nd, Pr), due to their high permittivity which makes possible for \n\nthe size reduction. At the present the only commercially available group of high relative \n\npermittivity microwave materials were ceramics based on BRT solid solutions with \n\nrelative permittivity ranging from 80 to 90. BaO-Nd2O3-TiO2 (BNT) system stands out and \n\nhas attracted the interest of researchers and industrialists due to its high relative \n\npermittivity. The earliest works on these systems are credited to Bolton [15] and Kolar et \n\nal. [16-17].  \n\n \n\nKolar et al. [17] estimated the ternary compound BaO.R2O3.4TiO2 as \n\nBaO.R2O3.5TiO2. Later, Takahashi et al. [18-19] used the more precise co-precipitation \n\nmethod to synthesise the tertiary compound and based on X-ray, TEM and Raman \n\nspectroscopy analysis the authors proposed a corrected composition as BaO.R2O3.4TiO2 (R \n\n= La, Nd, Sm and Pr) which confirmed the earlier results of Razagon et al. [20,21] and \n\nMatveeva et al. [22].  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nLater, Ohsato et al. [23] reported the structure of this compound, is a new \n\npervoskite like column which has 2X2 unit cell of pervoskite. The crystal structure of BNT \n\ncompounds essentially consists of a three-dimensional framework of corner-sharing \n\npervoskite-like octahedra joined together according to a pattern similar to that of the \n\ntetragonal tungsten bronzes. The structure is typified by oxygen octahedra linked at the \n\ncorners in a complex way to yield three types of channels: large pentagonal sites; diamond \n\nsites; and tiny triangular sites (Figure 1-2). The rare earth cations, i.e. Nd\n3+\n\n, occupy the \n\nrhombic channels (diamond sites), Ba\n2+\n\n cations fill the pentagonal channels [23]. The \n\ntriangular channels are empty. The crystallography of BRT solid-solutions has been \n\nreported by different authors. Gens et al.[24] suggested Pba2 (No. 32) or Pbam (No. 55) as \n\npossible space groups for the solid solution with the  lattice parameters calculated for the \n\nNd-analogue are a = 12.30 \u00c5, b = 22.21 \u00c5, c = 3.84 \u00c5. Later, Ubic et al. [25] found that \n\nmore correct assignment of space group is Pb21m. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1-2: Tungsten-bronze type like crystal structure of the Ba6-3xR8+2xTi18O54 solid solutions, in \n\nwhich R-rare earth [23]. \n\n  \n\nWithout any further ambiguity about the structure of the compound, the solubility \n\nlimit and the formula for BRT (R=Nd and Sr) was studied by Ohsato et al.[26] on the tie \n\nline x= 0 to 1, depicted in Figure 1-3. Along the tie line, between BaTiO3 and \n\nBaO.R2O3.4TiO2 compound the ratio between Ti:O(1:3) remain fixed. Such solid solutions \n\nhave different valence cations with large size: divalent Ba\n2+\n\n and smaller trivalent rare earth \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nR\n3+\n\n. To maintain electrostatic stability, three Ba\n2+\n\n ions should be replaced with two R\n3+\n\n \n\nions and a vacancy. So the substitution formula along the tie line is as follows.  \n\n3Ba\n2+\n\n \u00ab==\u00bb 2R\n3+\n\n + VAl \n\n \n\nwhere VAl is the valence of A1 site. The derived chemical formula for the solid solution is \n\nBa6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54. The authors reported the formation of solid solution of the tertiary \n\ncompound Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54 (R = Nd) for x ranges from 0.0? x ?0.75. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1-3: Ternary phase diagram of BaO-R2O3-TiO2 system [26]. \n\n \n\nIn later studies, Ohsato et al. [23] found that the tertiary component for x = 2/3 \n\nexhibit a high Qf factor of 10,000 and ?r 80-85 because of higher ordering of Ba and Nd in \n\nA2 and A1 sites at this composition; another possible reason might be the lower internal \n\nstrain compared with other compositions, which was obtained for the ? = 2?tan? equation \n\nusing Full Widths at Half Maximum (FWHM) of powder XRD, as illustrated in Figure 1-4.  \n\n \n\nThe further solubility limit 0.7? x ?1 was studied by L Zang et al. [27] in which the \n\nauthors reported good dielectric properties for composition x= 0.8, 0.9 and 1 with some \n\nsecondary phases of TiO2 and Nd4Ti9O24. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1-4: Internal strain versus composition(x) of Nd in Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54 [23]. \n\n \n\nBNT (1:1:4) have high Qf and permittivity but the tf (+59ppm/\u00baC) does not match \n\nthe application requirements. To make this material more useful in terms of practical \n\napplications it has been reported that tf can be tuned by the following approaches (i) by the \n\nuse of additives; (ii) proper variation of the Nd : Ba ratio, and (iii) or combination of \n\ndifferent rare earth elements. For example, Yong Jun [28] substituted Ba with some \n\nfraction of Bi to get tf near zero but simultaneously observed that large amounts of Bi \n\nreduce markedly Qf. By substituting Ba by Pb in BNT(114), Wakino et al. [29] achieved a \n\nhigh ?r of 85-88, a tf near zero and Qf = 6000GHz. Later, Nishigaki [30] achieved better \n\nmicrowave properties by substituting some Ba by Sr. Yong et al. [31] substituted Bi for Nd \n\nin Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54 and achieved excellent dielectric properties of ?r  = 99.1, tf = -\n\n5.5ppm/\u00baC and Qf = 5890GHz. The substitution of Nd and Ti in BaNd2Ti4O12 by Bi and Zr \n\noriginated an increase of the permittivity from 80 to 125 but quality factor decreasees from \n\n3000 to 600 and 4GHz, as reported by Nenasheva et al [32]. Kim et al [21] studied the \n\neffect of additional quantities of Nd and Ti on BNT ceramics. With the increase of Nd the \n\nsintering temperature increases and the quality factor decrease and vice versa for titanium \n\nexcess. The authors concluded that, the deviation from BaO/Nd2O3 = 1, the properties \n\ndecrease because of the formation of secondary phases. \n\n \n\nIn addition, as a result of the anisometric crystal structure (lattice parameter \n\nb(22.15)>a(12.13)>c(3.819)), BRT series tend to show anisotropic development of \n\nelongated grains in the microstructure at particular processing conditions. Therefore the \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\ndielectric properties of BRT ceramics display significant anisotropy as reported by Negas \n\n[33], and Hoffmann and Waser [34]. \n\n \n\nIn particular for BNT (1:1:4, x=2/3, discussed above), Wade et al. [35] confirm the \n\nanisotropic behaviour for ceramics prepared with and without template, and found that in \n\nperpendicular direction to the (0 0 1)-textured Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNdT) tf  decreased from \n\n59.2 ppm/\u00baC to 35 ppm/\u00baC and with template it goes to zero. \n\n \n\nAn anisotropic behaviour was also reported very recently for thick film of \n\nBNT(1:1:5) prepared by electrophoretic deposition [36]. It was reported that with \n\nincreasing sintering temperature there is an increase in the aspect ratio of the ceramic \n\ngrains and TC?r changes from -114 to +12ppm/\u00baC. These results are of particular \n\nimportance since it demonstrates that by controlling the processing parameters one may \n\ntailor the TC?r of thick films and at the same time to miniaturise the device size. \n\nSummary of important findings in the BNT system is given in Table 1-3. \n\n \n\nTable 1-3: Important properties reported for BaO2-Nd2O3-TiO2 (1:1:4) system. \n\n Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54 \n\nRelative \n\npermittivi\n\nty \n\ntf or \n\nTC?r(ppm/\no\n\nC) \n\nQf (GHz) Group \n\nBNT(1:1:4) substitute Ba with Pb 85-88 0 6000 Wakino (1984) \n\nBaNd2Ti4O12 substitute Nd and Ti \n\nwith Bi and Zr \n125 -- 600 Nenasheva (2001) \n\nBNT(x=2/3) (Perpendicular) 65.4 +35.3 8900 Ohsato (2006) \n\nBNT (x=2/3) (parallel) 71.8 +109.2 9400 Ohsato (2006) \n\nBNT (x=2/3) + Template \n\n(perpendicular) \n79.8 0 9500 Ohsato (2006) \n\nBNT (x=2/3) 83 59.2 9300 Ohsato(2001) \n\nBa6?3x(Nd0.85,Bi0.15)8+2xTi18O54 99.1 -5.5 5290 Y.

The classic \n\nprototype (high-temperature) symmetry is a primitive cubic cell, but perovskites may \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nundergo many types of phase transitions on cooling and the symmetry is rarely cubic at \n\nroom temperature so as tertiary compound of BaO\u2013La2O3\u2013TiO2 system. \n\n \n\nIn the BaO\u2013La2O3\u2013TiO2 system, Saltykova et al. [37] found the BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n \n\nhomologous series exists with three kinds of compounds on the La4Ti3O12\u2013BaTiO3 tie line \n\nnear the tungstenbronze-type like Ba6?3xR8+2x Ti18O54 (R = rare earth) represented in the \n\nphase diagram of the BaTiO3\u2013La4Ti3O12 binary system of (Figure 1-5): n = 1, \n\nBaLa4Ti4O15; n = 2, Ba2La4Ti5O18; and n = 4, Ba4La4Ti7O24. Different R&amp;D groups have \n\nwritten the compound formula in different ways the Fritz group in France represent it as \n\n(Ba,La)nTin\u20131O3n, where n = 5, BaLa4Ti4O15 [38-39-41]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1-5: Phase diagram of the BaTiO3-La4Ti3O12 binary system [41]. \n\n \n\nThe crystallographic system of BaLa4Ti4O15 compound is an hexagonal perovskite \n\nlike layer structure as proposed by Saltykova et al. [37]. Harre et al. [38] further analyzed \n\nthe crystal structure of BaLa4Ti4O15 without distinguish Ba/la sites by using X-Ray \n\ndiffraction. This structure stacking with (Ba, La)O3 close-packed layer consists of one \n\nperovskite slab with cubic closed packing and another junction slab with an hexagonal \n\nclosed packing type. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nLater, the crystal structure as a function of the Ba/La ordering was analyzed using \n\nRietveld refinement of neutron powder diffraction by Teneze et al. [39] and distinguishes \n\nthe Ba and La sites in the crystal structure of BaLa4Ti4O15 compound. Ohsato et al. [40] \n\nhave also successfully distinguished the sites of Ba\n2+\n\n and La\n3+\n\n in BaLa4Ti4O15 compound \n\nby the X-ray analysis of single crystal regardless of similarity for atomic scattering factors. \n\nG. Trolliard et al. [41] study the microphases in the La4Ti3O12-BaTiO3 system by using \n\nHRTEM to investigate the coherent intergrowth occurrence in this system. \n\n \n\nIt has been reported that the structure of BLT corresponds to a close packing of \n\nAO3 (where A = Ba, La) mixed layers [41]. Within the layers, the A and O atoms are \n\nordered ( Figure 1-6(a)). Each A atom is surrounded by six oxygen atoms, whereas each \n\noxygen atom has two linearly coordinated A atoms among its six nearest neighbours. To \n\navoid any direct A\u2013A connection, successive layers are shifted from each other by a 1/3(0 \n\n1 -1 0)H vector, so that the A atom positions in one layer project into the centre of a \n\ntriangle formed by the A atoms in the adjacent layers (position 1 or 2 in Figure 1-6(a)). \n\nOne quarter of the octahedral interstices between two such layers are surrounded \n\nexclusively by oxygen atoms and are occupied by Ti atoms (the small open circles in \n\nFigures 1-6 (b)\u2013(d)). All oxygen octahedra located within the cubic-close-packed (ccp) part \n\nof the sequence are corner shared and occupied by Ti atoms. In each triplet of face-sharing \n\noctahedra, characteristic of the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) part of the sequence, the \n\ncentral octahedra are vacant. The lattice parameter a is determined by the hexagonal \n\nsublattice of A atoms and remains nearly constant at ~5.6 A\u00b0. The c parameter depends on \n\nthe stacking sequence of AO3 layers (the thickness of each octahedral sheet is ~2.2 A\u00b0). In \n\nthe case of BLT, n = 5, and a cooperative tilting of TiO6 octahedra within the perovskite \n\nblocks leads to doubling of the c-axis. As a consequence, BLT is ascribed as a trigonal \n\nstructure with the space group P.3c1, and the lattice parameters derived from x-ray \n\ndiffraction data are a = 5.5720 A\u00b0 and c = 22.500 A\u00b0 (?10 \u00d7 2.2 A\u00b0 ), respectively, in the \n\nhexagonal setting [14]. \n\n \n\nReaney et al. [42] further investigated the structure of BLT ceramics because of the \n\nexisting asymmetric peak in X-Ray diffraction studies. Based on energy-dispersive x-ray \n\nanalysis and raman spectroscopy it was concluded that there is a heterogeneous distribution \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nof the constituent cations, may induce asymmetry which cause the presence of two \n\nhexagonal phases of slightly different lattice parameter.  \n\n \n\nThe dielectric properties of BaLa4Ti4O15 ceramics were reported by Vineis et \n\nal.[43] to be ?r = 43, Qf = 11583GHz and tf = -17ppm/\u00baC. La was substituted with various \n\ncations as Al, Y, Sm, Nd and Gd for composition n=1 in order to obtain tf near zero and \n\nbest results were achieved for Al with tf = +1.3 ppm/\u00baC, ?r  = 44 and Qf = 47000GHz.  \n\n \n\nThe dielectric properties of BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n were investigated by Ohsato et al. \n\n[44] as well and it was found that properties for `n\u00b4 ranges from 0.8-2, ?r stays constant \n\naround 45 and Qf varies between 30000GHz to 48000GHz and tf from -21 to -12ppm/\u00baC. \n\nFor n = 2 to 4, ?r, tf increases and Qf decreases because of the formation of secondary \n\nphases Ba5La4Ti8O27. It was then concluded that compounds ranging from n = 1 to 2 are \n\nthe suitable materials for microwave applications in base stations of portable telephones \n\nwith ?r = 44, Qf = 47000GHz and tf = +1.3 ppm/\u00baC.  \n\n \n\nOn further investigation on dielectric properties and phase formation for ceramics \n\nof BaxLa4Ti3+xO12+3x where `x\u00b4 ranges from 0-1 Yamada et al. [45] found that for \n\nhomologous compound BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n ,  n = 0, the single phase exists for \n\nBaxLa4Ti3+xO12+3x , x = 0.0-0.5 and for n = 1 and in the intermediate region the two phase \n\nco-exist. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1-6: (a) Arrangement of A and O atoms in the AO3 mixed layers; (b) stacking of two adjacent \n\nAO3 layers, showing the TiO6 octahedra; (c) view of this stacking along [1 0 -1 0]H; (d) view of this \n\nstacking along the [1 1 -2 0]H direction; (e) the distorted AO3 layers in BLT\u2013r and l visualize the \n\nclockwise and counter clockwise rotations of corner-sharing octahedral respectively; (f) schematic \n\nrepresentation of BLT as viewed along    [2 -1 -1 0]H, where the rotations of TiO6 octahedra around the \n\nc-axis are represented by r (clockwise) and l (counter clockwise). ccp and hcp represent cubic close-\n\npacked and hexagonal close-packed, respectively[14]. \n\n \n\nJawahar el at. [46] investigated the properties of MO\u2013La2O3\u2013TiO2 where M is Ba, \n\nSr and Ca. For BaLa4Ti4O15 ceramics with relative density of 96.2% they found that  ?r = \n\n49, Qf = 16222 GHz and tf -13ppm/\u00baC, which are similar to the results to those reported by \n\nOhsato et al. [2].   \n\n \n\nFor improving the properties of BLT, Longtu Li et al. [47] substitute small amounts \n\nof Ba by Ca and Sr in (Ba1?xAx)La4Ti4O15 (where A is Ca and Sr). It was reported that with \n\nCa substitutions, the permittivity of the sample increases and tf approaches from -3 to -\n\n10ppm/\u00baC, ?r = 46, Qf 52800. In the case of Sr substitution the temperature of sintering is \n\nreduced to some extent and achieve high Qf  up to 53,000 GHz, ?r = 49 and tf  -3ppm/\u00baC.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nSimilar to BNT in BLT ceramics, the large anisotropy in the lattice parameters (a = \n\n5.5720 A\u00b0 versus c = 22.500 A\u00b0) promotes the growth of lath or plate-like particles. Such \n\ngrains have been reported to align during powder pressing with the a, b plane normal to the \n\npressing direction, and the final sintered body is therefore grain-oriented [42]. Anisotropy \n\nin the dielectric permittivity was absorbed by 20% in these ceramics, when measured in the \n\nparallel and perpendicular direction to the pressing one. \n\n \n\nAll the work mentioned above prepared the tertiary compound (BaLa4Ti4O15) by \n\nthe solid-state method. Y. Fukami et al. [48] in his studies use the molten salt synthesis \n\nmethod using NaCl, KCl and NaCl\u2013KCl flux. Similarly the authors mixed the BLT \n\ntemplets (plate-like) during the synthesis and observed the anisotropic microstructure in \n\nthe sintered ceramics. The samples prepared with templates shows higher properties then \n\nsample prepared without templates. \n\n \n\nHong Zheng et al. [49] used glass as a sintering aid material for the composites of \n\nBLT and BNT. The sintering temperature was reduced from 1400-1500\u00baC to 950-1140\u00baC \n\nrespectively. The addition of glass did not introduce considerable changes in ?r and tf but \n\nthe Qf (~2305GHz) was deteriorated.

The term dielectric \n\nresonator is defined as a, cylinder with relative permittivity ?r sufficiently high for a \n\nstanding electromagnetic wave to be sustained within its volume because of reflection at \n\nthe dielectric\u2013air interface.  Dielectric resonators generally consist of a \"puck\" of ceramic \n\nthat has a large dielectric constant and a low dissipation factor. The resonance frequency is \n\ndetermined by the overall physical dimensions of the puck and the dielectric constant of \n\nthe material.  \n\n \n\nThere are many field modes possible within a resonant chamber. These modes are \n\ndivided into four basic types, depending on their field components. A propagating \n\nelectromagnetic wave can have both longitudinal and transverse components. If both the \n\nelectrical and magnetic fields have only transverse components then the mode is called a \n\ntransverse electric and magnetic mode or TEM mode. If the electric field\u00b4s longitudinal \n\ncomponent is zero but the magnetic field is allowed a non zero longitudinal component, \n\nthen the mode is called a transverse magnetic mode or TM mode. Conversely, if the \n\nmagnetic field\u00b4s longitudinal component is zero but the electric field is allowed a non zero \n\nlongitudinal component, then the mode is called transverse electric, or TE mode. If the \n\nboth electric and magnetic field are allowed non zero longitudinal field components, then \n\nthe mode is a hybrid field different modes. \n\n  \n\n TE and TM modes are generally written with subscripts, TEnmp, to donate the \n\ngeometry. The first script, n denotes the number of azimuthal or circumferential field \n\nvariations in the resonator. The second subscript, m, denotes the number of radial field \n\nvariations in the width of the resonator. The last subscript p denotes the number of axial \n\nvariations of the field along the resonator\u2019s height. It can be express as the sum p = l + ?, \n\nwhere ? is a non integer number smaller than unity and depends in a complicated way on \n\npropagation constant and geometry; and l = 0,1,2,\u2026.A diagram of all modes are \n\nrepresented in Figure 1-7. \n\n \n\nTE01? mode resonator is suitable for the resonator with high Q such as channel \n\nfilters for the base station. This mode resonator has the highest Q values in the resonator \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\ntype but the size is very large. However, TM010 modes have 65 % less Qf then TE01? mode \n\nresonator but size is only about 15 % of TE01? mode resonator. TEM is the most common \n\ncoaxial type resonator; it is widely used as filters in mobile phone and many other radio \n\ncommunication equipment. \n\n \n\nDielectric resonators are increasingly being used at lower frequency, down to 1GHz \n\nin mobile telecommunications application frequently as filters. Dielectric resonators at this \n\nfrequency are bulky but still smaller then cavity resonators. The dielectric ceramics with \n\npermittivity higher then 38 is acceptable for this application with high Qf. For further \n\nreducing the size, the researches are looking for materials which have high dielectric \n\npermittivity with high Q factor [50]. Figure 1-8 shows an example of a space qualified \n\ncommercial dielectric resonator filter that has been designed for direct broad cast TV \n\nsatellites operate at 12GHz. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1-7: Various types of dielectric resonators.

[50] \n\n \n\nThe integration of antenna technology and active devices to form transceiver \n\nmodules and electronically scanned array has usually been accomplished in numerous \n\nconfigurations using microstrip patch antennas. However, open dielectric resonators offer \n\nattractive features as integrated antenna elements, which still need to explore. The \n\nadvantage includes their small size, mechanical simplicity, high radiation efficiency, \n\nrelative large width etc. [7]. The most successful fabricated components have been in the \n\narea of antennas, either surface-wave antennas or leaky-wave antennas. [52] Several types \n\nof miniature antennas are now in use. \n\n \n\nAs said above, application of dielectric materials in microwave components is very \n\ncost effective and lead to a significant miniaturization of the device, particularly when \n\nmicrowave integrated circuit (MIC) or monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) \n\nstructures are used. Excellent performance in filters and oscillators are currently being \n\nachieved.

To make such devices, thick film technology is \n\nbecoming more and more important in particular for electronic devices, namely for surface \n\nmounted devices, hybrid integrated circuits and sensors. A number of established \n\ntechniques for thick films fabrication have been reported, such as screen printing, ink-\n\njetting, tap casting and Electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Among all the above techniques, \n\nelectrophoretic technique has gain considerable importance because of its high reliability, \n\nlow cost and high performance products. In this chapter, a review on EPD technique is \n\npresented, which includes EPD mechanisms and kinetics, fabrication parameters (such as \n\ndeposition and suspension variables), and applications. \n\n \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nHistory of EPD \n\n \n\nEPD is known since 1808, when a russian scientist Ruess saw that clay particles \n\nmove in the presence of the electric field. The first practical use of EPD was reported in \n\n1933 in a USA patent for the deposition of thoria particles on platinum substrates [1] The \n\nuse of EPD for the fabrication of ceramics was first investigated by Hamaker [2] in 1940 \n\nand more recently in 1980\u00b4s it received a great deal of attention for the fabrication of \n\nadvanced ceramics. \n\n \n\nMore recently, the number of applications has quickly developed, and as noted by \n\nBoccaccini [3], there has been a considerable increase in the areas of application of EPD in \n\nthe last 10 years, denoted by the existence of more than a thousand articles and patents \n\nrelated to EPD. Figure 2-1 shows the extraordinary increase of the number of published \n\nscientific papers, identified in a Web of Science search. The keywords ?electrophoretic \n\ndeposition?, from only less than 100 papers before 1970s to more than 1800 papers \n\npublished since 2000. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-1: Number of published scientific papers on EPD from 1965 until 2008. The search was \n\nconducted by using the keyword \u201celectrophoretic deposition\u201d in Web-of-Science\u00ae \n\n \n\nDefinitions of EPD  \n\n \n\nElectrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a colloidal process, which is used for coatings \n\nand fabrication of films. It has gain considerable interest not only in academia but also in \n\nindustries because of the versatility of its use with different materials and substrates and \n\ncost effectiveness. The other advantages of EPD include the possibility to be used to \n\ndeposit coatings on complex shaped materials and despite being a wet process it offer easy \n\ncontrol of over thickness and morphology of the deposited film by controlling the \n\nprocessing parameters like voltage and time.  \n\n \n\nThe term ?electro deposition? is somewhat ambiguous because it can refer to either \n\nelectroplating or electrophoretic deposition, although it more often refers to the former. In \n\nthe electroplating processes, a coating is produced by the diffusion and migration of \n\nindividual ions in the solvent to the deposition electrode where they are electrochemically \n\nconverted to an insoluble form, in which the reaction is the reduction of metal ions in \n\nsolution to form the metal. In contrast, EPD uses charged particles that move under an \n\nexternal electric field to form consolidated films onto the opposite electrode (Table 2-1). \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n[4]. There are two types of EPD depending on which electrode the deposition happens. \n\nWhen the particles are positively charged, the deposition is formed on the cathode and the \n\nprocess is called cathodic EPD. On the contrary, the deposition formation on positive \n\nelectrode (anode) is termed as anodic EPD (Figure 2-2). By suitable modification of the \n\nsurface charge on the particles, both of the two modes of deposition are possible. [4] \n\n \n\nTable 2-1: Characteristics of electrodeposition techniques.

Four mechanisms have been identified \n\nby Omer van der Biest et at. [5] by which the powder particles get charged:  \n\n1) A selective adsorption of ions from the liquid onto the solid particle; \n\n2) Dissociation of ions from the solid phase into the liquid; \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n3) Adsorption or orientation of dipolar molecules at the particles surface; \n\n4) Electron transfer between the solid and liquid phase due to different work function. \n\nIn the case of ceramic particles, the last mechanism is not applicable but the first \n\ntwo invariably occur. The sign of the net charge on the particle will depend not only on \n\nwhether the ions involved are positive or negative, but also on whether mechanism (a) or \n\n(b) is dominant. Also, a positively-charged particle may even behave like a negative one, \n\nwhich is attracted to a positive electrode, if an excess of negative ions are attracted to the \n\nvicinity of the particles. Consequently, it is difficult to predict whether a deposition will \n\noccur on positive or negative electrodes in an unknown system.  \n\n \n\n2.3 Electrical Double Layer Concept and Zeta Potential \n\nThe electric double layer concept is a very important one for the surface chemistry \n\nof materials in colloidal science field, i.e. in EPD. It describes the variation of the electric \n\npotential near a surface, and has a large bearing on the behaviour of colloids. Development \n\nof a net charge at the particle surface affects the distribution of ions in the surrounding \n\ninterfacial region, resulting in an increased concentration of counter ions (ions with oppose \n\ncharge to that of the particle) close to the surface. The liquid layer surrounding the particle \n\nconsists of two parts: an inner region where the ions are strongly bounded and an outer \n\n(diffuse) region where they are less firmly associated. Within this diffuse layer is a \n\nboundary known as the slipping plane, within which the particle acts as a single entity. [7] \n\n \n\nAn assumed negative charge particle in a suspension is surrounded by ions with a \n\npositive charge in a concentration higher than the bulk concentration of these ions; this is \n\nthe so-called electrical Double-Layer as illustrated in Figure 2-3 (a).The double layer \n\nthickness is of great importance in colloid stability and, for that matter, on flocculation, \n\nsince it controls the range of the double layer interaction. The thickness is determined by \n\nthe concentration and valence of the ions in suspension. A high concentration of ions (high \n\nionic strength) in the medium generally results in a decrease in the double layer thickness \n\nand consequent decrease in the potential. [8] When an electric field is applied, the charged \n\nparticles and surrounding ions will move in opposite directions. However, the ions are also \n\nattracted by the particle, and as a result, a fraction of the ions surrounding the particles will \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nnot move in the opposite direction but will move along with the particles. Hence, there is a \n\nsurface of shear between the particles and the surrounding ions. As shown in Figure 2-3 (a) \n\nthe potential at the surface of slipping plane is termed the zeta-potential or electrokinetic \n\npotential [9]. \n\n \n\nThe schematic curve of zeta potential versus pH value is depicted in Figure 2-3 (b). \n\nThe zeta potential is affected by the pH environment and is usually positive for low pH \n\nvalues and negative at high pH. \n\n \n\nNumerous physical and chemical factors can influence the magnitude and sign of \n\nthe zeta potential. It may depend on the presence or absence of added electrolytes, or on \n\nthe concentration of the suspension itself. In addition, zeta potential can be controlled by a \n\nvariety of charging agents such as acids, bases and specifically adsorbed ions or \n\npolyelectrolytes, in the suspension [10]. Thus it is possible to use a variety of additives that \n\naffects the charge magnitude and its polarity in the suspension on EPD. Generally, the \n\nmain criteria for selection of a charging agent are the preferred polarity and deposition rate \n\nof the particles. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-3 (a) Schematic representation of the double layer surrounding a charged particle and \n\nevolution of the electric potential from the surface potential, [11], and (b) Zeta potential versus pH \n\nvalue.  \n\n \n\n     \n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nThe zeta potential is the main parameter determining the electrokinetic behavior of \n\nparticles in suspension, and as a consequence is a key factor in the EPD process. It is \n\nimperative to achieve a high zeta potential and a uniform surface charge density on the \n\nsurface of suspended particles for a successful EPD. Zeta potential plays a role in: (i) the \n\nstabilization of the suspension by determining the intensity of repulsive interactions \n\nbetween the particles, (ii) determining the direction and migration velocity of particles \n\nduring EPD and (iii) determining the quality of the deposit. As zeta potential is closely \n\nrelated to the particle\u2019s double layer thickness, it provides also information on the \n\nagglomeration of the particles in the suspension. In general, the higher the absolute value \n\nof the measured zeta potential, the better is the dispersion of the particles in the suspension \n\n[9]. \n\n \n\n2.4 Mechanisms of Deposition  \n\nAlthough EPD is an old process still the exact mechanism of deposition is not \n\nentirely clear. However some theories discussed possible mechanisms. \n\n \n\nHamaker et al. [12] have suggested that EPD is a sedimentation process due to \n\ngravitation. The pressure by incoming particles enables the particles next to the deposition \n\nelectrode to overcome the inter particle repulsion and sit on the electrode. Koelmans has \n\ncalculated the ionic strength near the electrode and found that it is equal to the ionic \n\nstrength required for the flocculation of a suspension [13]. Grillon has suggested that \n\nparticle neutralizes upon contact with the deposition electrode or the deposit [14]. Sarkar \n\nand Nicholson [1] suggested the double layer of counter ions also move with the particle \n\nbut the double layer is thinner ahead of the moving particle and thicker behind (illustrated \n\nin Figure 2-4), therefore the concentration of ions near the electrode is higher as compared \n\nto the solution. Thus, the counter ions recombine with their incoming co-ions to reform the \n\noriginal salt, which result in the thinning of the double layer of the particle in the deposit. \n\nAs a result there is a decrease in the repulsion near the substrate because of the thin double \n\nlayer what allows the particles to over come this repulsion barrier and attached to each by \n\nweak force such as van der Waal forces, allowing a deposit to be formed.  \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-4: Mechanism of double layer thickness with application of voltage by Sarkar [1]. \n\n \n\n2.5 Kinetics of Electrophoretic Deposition \n\nTo make EPD process commercially more viable the knowledge of the kinetics of \n\nEPD process is necessary. \n\n \n\nHamaker [2] proposed that the amount of deposited film is proportional to the \n\nconcentration of the suspension, time of deposition, surface area of deposit, and the electric \n\nfield. This yield of deposition varies linearly with applied field according to Hamaker\u2019s \n\nequation  \n\n                                          M=?\nt\n\nEdtAC\n0\n\n??                                                         (2.1) \n\nwhere M stands for the mass deposited in time t (s), C for the particle concentration in the \n\nsuspension (kg/m\n3\n), E for the electric field (V/m), A for the electrode area (m\n\n2\n), \u00b5 for the \n\nelectrophoretic mobility (m\n2\n/V?s)), a stands for and ? stands for a coefficient representing \n\nthe fraction of particles deposited near the electrode. \n\n  \n\nIn principle, EPD can be conducted under constant current or constant voltage with \n\neither constant or variable concentration against deposition time. Sarkar et al. [15] studied \n\nthe kinetic aspects of EPD through schematic plots of deposit weight versus deposition \n\ntime for four possible deposition conditions (Figure 2-5): curve A (constant current and \n\nconstant suspension solid concentration), curve B (constant current but decreasing \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nsuspension solid concentration), curve C (constant voltage and constant suspension solid \n\nconcentration) and curve D (constant voltage but decreasing suspension solid \n\nconcentration). The curve A shows that the rate of deposition is constant with time, \n\ndifferently, the rate of deposition decreases asymptotically against deposition time in either \n\nof the B, C, or D curves. Apparently, the deposition efficiency is highest in curve A, \n\nfollowed by curves B, C, and D, respectively in a certain deposition time. By comparison \n\nof the curves A, B, C and D, it clearly reveals that the highest efficiency is realized by \n\nconstant current and constant suspension solid concentration in terms of the deposition \n\nweight or thickness. In addition, it is much easier to predict and to control accurately the \n\ndeposited yield or thickness in constant current and constant suspension solid \n\nconcentration. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-5: Deposited weight as a function of the deposition time [1]. \n\n \n\n2.6 Parameters Related with Suspension \n\nThe main suspension parameter is the medium. \n\nIn EPD, water based and organic based mediums are used for deposition. Generally \n\nthe non aqueous medium is preferred over aqueous medium due to the reasons discussed \n\nahead. In water based medium electrolysis takes place at lower voltages (~5V), which \n\nresults in the formation of gas bubbles at the electrodes and formation of poor coatings or \n\nfilms. The density of the electric current is also higher in water suspensions which results \n\nin the heating of the suspension and sometimes loss of stability. The above stated reasons \n\nlimit the use of aqueous medium at high voltages. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, high voltages may be desirable in order to achieve high coating \n\nthicknesses or to increase the rate of deposition. In such applications, organic solvents are \n\nused as a medium. The organic solvents used are generally polar solvents such as alcohols \n\nand ketones. Ethanol, acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone are examples of solvents which \n\nhave been reported as suitable candidates for electrophoretic deposition and their \n\nproperties are summarised in Table 2-2.  \n\n \n\nTable 2-2: Physical properties of solvents [16]. \n\nSolvent Viscosity(cP)  Relative dielectric constant \n\nMethanol \n\nEthanol \n\nn-Propanol \n\nIso-propanol \n\nn-Butanol \n\nEthylene glycol \n\nAcetone \n\nAcetylacetone \n\n0.557 \n\n1.0885 \n\n1.9365 \n\n2.0439 \n\n2.5875 \n\n16.275 \n\n0.3087 \n\n1.09 \n\n32.63 \n\n24.55 \n\n20.33 \n\n19.92 \n\n17.51 \n\n37.7 \n\n20.7 \n\n25.7 \n\n \n\nThe other parameters besides the suspension medium that affect the quality of the \n\nsuspension are: \n\n1) Particle size and particle size distribution  \n\n2) Dielectric constant of the suspension \n\n3) Conductivity of the suspension \n\n4) Viscosity of the suspension  \n\n5) Zeta Potential \n\n6) Stability of the suspension \n\n \n\nConcerning the particle size and particle size distribution, it is advisable to have a \n\nparticle size within the range of 1-20 micrometer [16]. The use of particles with bigger \n\nsizes results in sedimentation because of gravitational force originating poor film quality. \n\nIn addition, a lower particle size and particle size distribution allows to avoid the formation \n\nof cracks in the films as Sato N et al. [17] observed in YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO).  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nThe behaviour of the dielectric constant of the suspension media was studied by \n\nPowers et al. [18] in different suspensions with beta-alumina particle. The authors found \n\nthat the deposition only take place for the solvent with dielectric constant in range of 12-\n\n25. For lower dielectric constant, the deposition fails because of the insufficient \n\ndissociative power of solvent and in the case of higher dielectric constant the high ionic \n\nconcentration in the suspension reduces the thickness of the double layer and  consequently \n\nthe electrophoretic mobility.  \n\n \n\nIn terms of conductivity of the suspension, based on the systematic studies of \n\nFerrari and Moreno [19] on the effect of conductivity and the viscosity of the suspension, it \n\nwas observed that if the conductivity of the suspension is very low, the particle charge \n\nelectronically and suspension looses the stability; on the other hand if the conductivity is \n\nhigh the particle motion is very slow. However, applied current can increase the margin of \n\nthe suitable conductivity region for EPD. It is generally accepted that the suitable regions \n\nof conductive are different for different systems. \n\n \n\nAs to the zeta potential it indicates the degree of repulsion between adjacent, \n\nsimilarly charged particles in dispersion. As mentioned previously, a high zeta potential \n\nwill confer stability to the suspension i.e. the solution or dispersion will resist to \n\nagglomeration. So, colloids with high zeta potential (negative or positive) are electrically \n\nstable while colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate. Table 2-3 \n\nrepresent the stability behaviour of the colloids with zeta potential.   \n\n \n\nZeta potential plays a major role in the: 1) stability of the suspension, 2) \n\ndetermination of the direction of the particle migration and 3) green density of the compact \n\nfilm [5]. A high particle charge is indeed required for a good stability of the suspension \n\nthat will ensure also a high and homogeneous green density of the deposited film. If the \n\nparticle charge is low, the particle tend to coagulate, the interspaces between the particles \n\nare high and lead to a poor green density of the compact. Higher surface charge particle \n\nduring deposition keeps the particles apart from each other, avoids coagulation and leads to \n\na high particle density. Therefore, it is essential to control the amount of suspension and \n\nadditives. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nThe stability of the suspension is characterized by the settling rate and the tendency \n\nto undergo or to avoid flocculation. Stable suspensions show no tendency to flocculation, \n\nsettle slowly and form dense and strongly adhering deposits at the bottom of the container. \n\nThe stability is mostly referred by the value of the zeta potential of the system high the zeta \n\npotential value better is the stability of the suspension [5]. The stability of the suspension \n\ncan be explain by the DLVO theory.  \n\n \n\nTable 2-3: The stability behaviour of colloids corresponds to zeta potential values [24]. \n\n \n\nZeta Potential(mV) \n\n \n\nStability behaviour of the colloids \n\n \n\nfrom 0 to \u00b15, Rapid coagulation or flocculation \n\nfrom \u00b110 to \u00b130 Incipient instability \n\nfrom \u00b130 to \u00b140 Moderate stability \n\nfrom \u00b140 to \u00b160 Good stability \n\nmore than \u00b161 Excellent stability \n\n \n\nDLVO theory established by Derjaguin and Landau [20] and Verwey and Overbeek \n\n[21]. According to this theory, the stability of a colloidal system is determined by the total \n\nenergy of interaction, determined by the sum of the electrical double layer repulsive forces \n\n(VR) and the van der Waals attractive forces (VA) which the particles experience as they \n\napproach each other. Increasing the ionic strength can significantly reduce the repulsive \n\nforces. The behaviour of particle separations depends critically upon the ionic strength and \n\nhence the electrolyte concentration of the suspension. At very low ionic strengths, the \n\npotential energy is high, make strong repulsive forces producing a totally dispersed system. \n\nAt a slightly higher but still low enough ionic strengths, the role of electrolytes, such as, \n\ncoagulants or flocculants, is either to reduce the electrostatic repulsion and hence making it \n\neasier for the particles aggregation, thereby destabilizing the suspension. But, re-dispersion \n\nis also possible by diluting the electrolyte solution to decrease the ionic strength. Finally, in \n\na high ionic strength, the colloid particles experience no repulsive forces. Consequently, \n\nfast coagulation occurs and the system is completely unstable under such circumstances. \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nThe original DLVO theory only considered the van der Waals and electrostatic \n\ninteractions in the suspension. Recently, it was proposed that the stabilization of colloidal \n\ndispersions might also be affected by steric stabilization and structural forces. [22] These \n\nmechanisms become important when long chain macromolecules are adsorbed to the \n\nparticles surface. When these particles with polymer chains protruding from their surfaces \n\ncome close to each other, sharp repulsive steric interactions will happen. In this case the \n\nchain configuration of the polymer is a very important parameter in steric stabilization [23] \n\nand determines the quality of the dispersant. Caution must be paid in using sterically \n\nstabilized suspension for EPD. For example, in extreme cases, adsorbed polymers can \n\nreverse the sign of surface charge, so the deposition may fail or could occur on the counter \n\nelectrode.  \n\n \n\n2.7 Parameters Related with Deposition Process \n\n2.7.1 Effect of Deposition Time \n\nBasu et al. [25] have observed that for constant applied voltage during initial time \n\nof deposition the thickness stay linear with time and deviates from the linearity for longer \n\ntime of deposition. A similar finding was observed by Chen and Liu [26] for ZnO coatings \n\non copper substrate as shown in Figure 2-6. In constant voltage deposition the electric field \n\ndecrease with the deposition time because of the formation of an insulating layer of \n\nceramic particle on the electrode [26].  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-6: Thickness versus time at constant voltage for ZnO suspensions [26]. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n2.7.2 Effect of Applied Voltage \n\nThe deposition thickness increases linearly with the constant time and varying \n\napplied potential. Powders can be deposited more quickly under high applied fields, but the \n\nquality (morphology and density) of the deposit can be affected by applied high fields. \n\nIndeed Basu at al [25] found that the more uniform films are formed at moderate electric \n\nfields between 25-100 V/cm and the films deposited under higher fields have poor surface \n\ntexture. Recently in the work of Fu Zhi et al.[27] on BNT thick films by EPD it was found \n\nthat for high voltages the deposition thickness decrease drastically (shown in Figure 2-7) \n\nand the quality of the deposited films is non uniform. A high applied field may cause \n\nturbulence in the suspension and the coating may be disturbed by flows in the surrounding \n\nmedium during its deposition. At the same time under high applied fields, particles move \n\nvery fast so that they may not have enough time to sit in their best positions to form a \n\nclose-packed structure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-7: Deposition thickness versus applied voltage for constant time [27]. \n\n \n\n2.7.3 Conductivity of the Substrate \n\nConductivity of the substrate is an important parameter and it affects the quality of \n\nthe green films deposited by EPD. Substrate of low conductivity such as La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 \n\n(LSM) leads to a decrease of the deposition rate and non-uniform green films. [28]. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n2.8 Applications of EPD Technique \n\nThe EPD technique can be applied for any class of materials which are available in \n\nthe form of fine powders, this includes ceramic, metal, polymer, and glasses. This process \n\nalready gain success in various applications and can be used to produce coatings, for shape \n\nmonolithic, laminated and graded free-standing objects, and for infiltration of porous \n\nmaterials and woven fibre preforms for composite production. \n\n \n\nCoatings \u2013 EPD is already in used for coatings, being the automotive industry one \n\nof the examples. German car maker companies are coating 800 bodies per hour by EPD \n\n[29]. Other examples are the deposition of insulating glass for electronic applications [30] \n\nand superconductive coating [31-32]. Worthwhile to note is the possibility of coating \n\nalmost any complex shaped object, such as metal cone with ceramic glaze [33] or Carbon \n\nCathode Tube coated with phosphor [34]. \n\n \n\nMonoliths -  For traditional ceramics, such as sanitary ware, the main advantage of \n\nEPD lies in its higher speed and in the low wear of the moulds compared with tape casting. \n\nTiles, closed and open end tubes, hemispheres, tubes with changes in diameter, and conical \n\nsections are some of the shapes that have been made by EPD. Technical ceramics such as \n\nalumina [35-36], silicon carbide [31-35], and aluminium nitride [37-38] have been shaped \n\nby EPD and are commercially available in the market for a long time. A good example of \n\nthe classical use of EPD is the fabrication of Beta-alumina tubes, used as electrolyte in \n\nsodium sulphur batteries [39-40]. \n\n \n\nLaminated materials - Laminated structures can be fabricate by EPD by \n\ndepositing one layer over the other by moving from one suspension to another. Nicholson \n\net al. [41] have produced ZrO2/Al2O3 laminates with alumina layer as thick as 12\u00b5m and \n\nzirconia layer of 2\u00b5m from ethanol based suspension. Vandeperre and Van der Beist [42] \n\ndeposited layers of SIC-based interlayers. You et al. [43] reported the fabrication of \n\nSiC/TiC laminated structures as illustrated in Figure 2.8. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-8:  SiC/TiC laminated structure produced by constant-current EPD [43]. \n\n \n\nFibre reinforced ceramic matrix composites - EPD is a simplest and cost \n\neffective method for fabrication of high-quality fibre reinforced ceramic matrix \n\ncomposites. Kaya et al. [44] used EPD to infiltrate performs with tight fibre weave \n\narchitectures using different anodized ceramic particles, including silica and boehemite \n\nsols, as well as dual-component sols of mullite compositions. Figure 2-9 depicts the EPD \n\ninfiltrated Ni-coated carbon fibres reinforced alumina matrix composites containing 30 \n\nvol% of fibre loading.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-9: Ni-coated carbon fibre perform infiltrated with boehmite sol. [44] \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nDeposition of nano particles into nanostructures \u2013 The rising interest in the field \n\nof nanostructure is because often these structures exhibit new properties that are \n\nremarkably different from the bulk ones and because by controlling the size one can \n\nmanipulate the properties. EPD of nanoparticles was first investigated by Giersig and \n\nMulvaney [45, 46] to prepare ordered monolayers of gold nanoparticles. Tebellion and \n\nClased [47] investigated the structured deposition of gold, silver and rare earth carbonate \n\nnanoparticles. \n\n \n\nIn the last few years the interest of the scientific community in carbon nanotubes \n\n(CNTs) has increased significantly as reflected by the huge number of papers published \n\nand patents [48-49]. To further expand the horizon for the application of CNTs researchers \n\nare using EPD for making thin films of CNTs. Jung et al. [50-51] deposited the thin film of \n\nSingle wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) in aqueous media and the deposited film showed \n\ngood field emission properties. Hasabe et al. [52] deposited the SWCNT on SnO2 electrode \n\nfor solar cell application. Boccaccini et al. [53] have deposited MWCNTs onto highly \n\nporous bioactive glass scaffolds with the intention of imparting a monotopography to the \n\npore wall surfaces (Figure 2-10).  The scientist have also successfully synthesized the \n\nnanorods, nanowires and nanotubes of ZnO by EPD.[54].  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2-10: SEM micrograph of the electrophoretically deposited MWCNT coating on the surface of \n\na bioactive glass foam [53]  \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n2.9 References \n\n[1] P Sarkar, P S Nicholson., 1996.J.Am.

Objective of this thesis \n\n \n\n ?On many levels, RF/microwave today compares to digital's (silicon based \n\ncircuitry) level of integration a quarter century or so ago \u2014 essentially a lot of large (by \n\ncurrent standards) components bunched together. Digital, however, has been on a \n\nseemingly unstoppable evolution toward ever-smaller, less-costly, and more- tightly \n\nintegrated components, driven largely by the demands of consumer electronics such as cell \n\nphones, pocket-sized GPS devices, digital cameras, and even hearing aides. The same is \n\nnot true for RF/microwave \u2026 ? in Military &amp; Aerospace Electronics August, 2004, by J.R. \n\nWilson [1].  \n\n \n\nHowever as frequencies continue to move stealthily up because the density of \n\navailable spectrum is increasing and as noise and couplings become more problematic for \n\ndigital circuits, there is currently a market drive for the search of solutions intermediate \n\nbetween digital and RF/microwave circuits. Within this context, miniaturization (small and \n\ncompact), integration and lowering costs are key words in the RF/microwave arena. \n\n \n\nNew advanced technology to build low loss, lower phase noise integrated circuits \n\nwith low cost, high density, small size and lightweight are indeed required in this rapidly \n\ngrowing wireless industry. [2] One example is miniaturization of systems such as planar \n\ncircuits, antennas, filters, couplers, baluns, etc. Because of this demand of smallness, thin \n\nand/or thick dielectric films are now being considered to replace dielectric components \n\ncurrently utilized in bulk ceramic form. This drives the use of thick film processing \n\ntechniques, such as Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD), for the fabrication of dielectric thick \n\nfilms for RF and High Frequencies. \n\n \n\n Although thin film technologies are being explored for the wireless circuit \n\ntechnology as well, they are expensive with limited suitability for commercial mass \n\nproduction [3]. Alternatively, thick films technology offers advantages such as low cost, \n\nreproducibility and feasibility to be large-scale continuous process. Thick films allow \n\ndesigners to combine microwave and digital functions on proper substrates and to \n\nincorporate components to the main structures, which offers increased potentials in terms \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nof reliability, miniaturization of circuits, circuit design capabilities, continuous flow in \n\nproduction processes, and hence a reduction in cost [4]. Besides, thick dielectric films have \n\nthe capability of withstanding high voltages and high thermal conductivity, which led to \n\napplications in mobile phone RF power amplifiers where small physical size and high \n\npower handling is necessary; in addition, thick dielectric films can also be used as \n\nsubstrates in microelectronic devices to support mechanically other materials and to ensure \n\ntheir adhesion on it, which may be difficult to achieve with thin film materials [4]. \n\n \n\nAs describe before, among low loss dielectrics, the BaO-Re2O3-TiO2 (Re = \n\nLa,Nd,Sm,Pr) system represents an important commercial family of microwave materials. \n\nAlthough BNT ceramics are currently being produced for resonators, antennas and \n\nsubstrates [7], as shown in Figure 3-1(a) and BLT has optimum properties for base station \n\napplication, the high permittivity of BNT and BLT make them suitable candidates for the \n\nminiaturization in to thick films.  \n\n \n\nOn the other hand the fabrication of dielectric films on metal foils is presently of \n\ninterest for devices integrated into electronic packaging due to cost and space benefits. [13] \n\nFor example, as shown in Figure 3-1 (b), the current microstrip patch antenna usually \n\nrequires the metallization of a ground plane on one side of the dielectric materials by \n\nscreen printing. However, this metallization process can be avoided by directly depositing \n\nthe dielectric layer on a metallic substrate. In this case, for the reasons above described and \n\nin particular the possibility of being scaled up, EPD looks like very appealing for this \n\npurpose. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 3-1: Photographs of commercially available microwave resonators and substrates (after \n\nMorgan Technical Ceramics Ltd) (a) and schematic representation of a microstrip patch antenna (b) \n\n(ww.emtalk.com) \n\n \n\nHence the general objective of this thesis is to contribute, from the materials \n\nscience perspective, to the pool of scientific and engineering knowledge that will allow the \n\ndevelopment of next generation of small, integrated and low cost based RF/microwave \n\ndevices. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nAs said before, for microwave dielectrics, there are three significant properties to \n\nbe considered: (i) the relative permittivity, that determines the size of the electronic \n\ncomponent; (ii) the loss tangent (or quality factor, Q) that determines the selectivity and \n\nperformance of the device and (iii) the temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency \n\nthat determines the frequency stability of the device [5]. And among the materials \n\nrecognised to full fill these requirements tungsten bronzoids BaO\u2013Ln2O3\u2013TiO2 (Ln = Nd, \n\nLa, among others) with high ?r (80- 90) and low losses (Q = 10,000) and low tf (+ \n\n59ppm/\u00baC) represent an important commercial family of microwave materials [6]. \n\n \n\nBaO-Nd2O3-TiO2 ceramics are currently being produced for resonators, filters and \n\nsubstrates, among others applications [7], but the commercial use of BNT thick films has \n\nnot yet been reported. However, the first results on the fabrication and characterization of \n\nBNT thick films that have been published very recently [8-9] are quite promising. It is \n\ndemonstrated that 52 \u00b5m thick BaNd2Ti5O14 films exhibit a dielectric constant and a loss \n\ntangent of 107 and 0.0006 (Q of 1600) at 1 MHz, respectively, TC?r is below +58.5 \n\nppm/\u00b0C and the losses are not significantly increased up to the gigahertz regime. \n\nParticularly relevant is the demonstration that with thick films besides facilitating scaling \n\nto small device sizes for high frequency operations, the control of substrate constraint and \n\nsintering conditions can be used to control grain anisotropy and thus microwave properties \n\nof BNT films, namely tuning TC?r to zero. \n\n \n\nAnother member of the tungsten bronzoid family is BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n (BLT). BLT \n\nhas hexagonal perovskite structure with ?r~44, Q.f~47,000 GHz and tf - 2ppm/\u00baC. Similarly \n\nto BNT, BLT dielectric characteristics may allow for further miniaturization of filters and \n\noscillator components in systems ranging from cellular telephones to global positioning \n\ntechnologies [10]. Contrary to BNT, there are no reports on the fabrication and \n\ncharacteristics of BLT thick films.  \n\n \n\nIn terms of Microwave Material, materials for resonators according to Ian M. \n\nReaney [11] there is currently a lack of dielectric materials with dielectric permittivity \n\nbetween 45 and 80, together with low losses and low tf as shown in Figure 3-2. \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3-2: log10 Q.fo versus ?r for commercial or equivalent dielectric microwave dielectric ceramics \n\n[11]. \n\n \n\nOne way of full filling this need is by engineering materials, for example by \n\nfabricating composite materials in which the properties will be tailored by mixing \n\nappropriate contents of end members that per se have opposite tf. Composite MW ceramics \n\nof xBNT-(1-x)BLT system were synthesise and the best properties were obtained for the \n\ncomposition x = 0.55 and 0.75 with ?r = 61, tf &lt;-21ppm/\u00baC and Qf > 10,000GHz [12]. \n\nAnother approach to tailor the dielectric properties of MW materials, namely to achieve \n\ntemperature stability, recently explored in the field of thin films, is the fabrication of \n\nlayered structures. \n\n \n\nHowever no such approaches have yet been considered for dielectric thick films. \n\nHence, the specific objective of this thesis is the proof of concept of electrophoretic \n\ndeposition of structured, microwave composites, that includes: i) to develop a method of \n\nfabricating structured functional composites using electrophoretic deposition, ii) to \n\nfabricate planar BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) composites, iii) to \n\nfabricate and characterized BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) thick films and iii) to characterize the \n\nstructured composites using dielectric spectroscopy and analytical electron microscopy \n\nand XR diffraction. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nFor that BNT (Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 ) and BLT (BaLa4Ti4O15) powders were \n\nsynthesised, and suspension were prepared and optimised to ensure perfect electrophoretic \n\ndeposition conditions, and BLT and BLT / BNT (and vice versa) composites were \n\nfabricated in this work. Due to the lack of information, BLT thick films were prepared by \n\nEPD for the first time and their properties evaluated. Simultaneously, and as a comparison \n\ntool, BLT ceramics were prepared from the same powders used to fabricate the thick films.  \n\n \n\nReferences  \n\n \n\n[1] J R Wilson, Article on ?RF and microwave industry struggles to meet the high demands \n\nof the military?

Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nIn this chapter details of the experimental procedure used in this work are described which \n\nincludes: i) the synthesis of BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (1:1:4) \n\n(BNT) powders, ii) preparation of the suspensions for the electrophoretic deposition and \n\nthe studies of the suspension stability, iii) fabrication of thick films by EPD, iv) preparation \n\nof ceramics and v) description of films and ceramics characterization. \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction  \n\nThe steps followed for the synthesis and characterization of Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 \n\n(BNT), BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) thick films and thick composites films of BNT - BLT is \n\npresented in the flowchart of Figure 4-1. \n\n \n\nAs for the first step, BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) \n\npowders were prepared by conventional solid state method. Both powders were \n\ncharacterized in terms of their structure, phase purity and morphology. In the following \n\nsteps, suspensions of BNT and BLT powders were prepared under different conditions and \n\ncharacterized in terms of stability in order to optimise the film deposition process. BLT \n\nand BNT thick films were deposited on platinum foil substrates by EPD and the processing \n\nvariables were modified to change the final morphology and physical characteristics of the \n\nfilms. The deposited films were dried in air followed by iso static pressing and sintered at \n\ndifferent temperatures. Structure, phase content and microstructure of the films were \n\nassessed by X Ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The electrical \n\nresponse of the films was characterized by impedance spectroscopy as a function of \n\ntemperature and frequencies (within the radio frequency range) and under different applied \n\nvoltage. BLT ceramics were prepared to compare with films electrical response. \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4-1: General flow chart of the experimental work conducted in this work. \n\n \n\n4.2 Synthesis of BLT and BNT Powders \n\nBaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (1:1:4) (BNT) powders were \n\nsynthesised by solid state reaction. The starting precursors,  BaCO3 (Aldrich, Product No.: \n\n513-77-9, purity>99.9%), Nd2O3 (Aldrich, Product No.:1313-97-9, purity >99.9%), La2O3 \n\n(Aldrich, purity>99.9%),) and TiO2 (Aldrich, Product No.:1317-80-2, purity >99.9%), \n\nwere weighted and mixed according to the correct stoichiometry. La2O3 and Nd2O3 are very \n\nhydroscopic in nature so, both the powders were heated at 850\u00baC for 3h, cooled down in \n\ndesiccators and weighted immediately before mixing with the rest of the reagents. The \n\nmixed powders were ball milled in ethanol media, with zirconia balls for 24h followed by \n\ndrying in oven at 100\u00baC for 12h. The dried powders were then taken out of the crucibles \n\nand grounded by using mortar and pestle. \n\n \n\nThe grounded powder was calcined in a programmable furnace equipped with an \n\nautomatic temperature controller. The temperature for calcination was chosen according to \n\nthe results from Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) / Themogravimetry (TG), obtained \n\nwith a heating rate of 5 \u00baC/min. The phase purity of the calcined powders was examined by \n\nusing X-Ray Diffraction (equipped with EDS).  \n\nSample Characterization ( microstructure \n\nand dielectric properties) \n\nPowder Preparation \n\nand Characterization \n\nSuspension Preparation and \n\nCharacterization \n\nElectrophoretic Deposition \n\nSample Drying, Compaction and \n\nSintering \n\nCeramics Preparation \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nAfter calcination and phase purity examination, the powders were ball milled for \n\n24h at 180rpm to get small particle size, which is crucial for a good stability of the \n\nsuspension and an improved green density of the film. The particle size distribution was \n\ndetermined by a Particle Size Analyzer (Coulter LS 230). The specific surface area of \n\nmilled BLT and BNT powders was determined by BET(Gemini 2370 V5.00). The calcined \n\nmilled powders were dried at 100\u00baC for 24h and kept inside the desiccators to avoid any \n\nreaction with air which could lead to the aging of the powders. The powders morphology \n\nwas observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi, S-4000 SEM / ED)  \n\n \n\n4.3 Suspension Preparation and Suspension Medium \n\nSuspensions were prepared in different media such as water, acetone (>99.9%, \n\nMerck) and ethanol (>99.9%, Merck). For varying the pH of the media diluted HNO3 \n\n(?99.8%, Aldrich) and triethanolamine (>99%, Merck) were used.  \n\n \n\nSuspension prepared in glass beaker with 1g of BLT or BNT powders were mixed \n\nin 100 ml of each of the suspension medium. The powders were slowly added into the \n\nsuspension media under constant stirring by ultrasonication, to promote the dispersion of \n\npowders in the suspension. A further dispersion of the suspension was conducted by using \n\nmagnetic stirring for approximately 1 to 2h. \n\n \n\nIn order to increase the charge of the particles and to achieve high zeta potential \n\nvalues for the prepared suspensions, several additives such as dilute nitric acid and \n\ntriethanolamine were analysed. \n\n \n\nEPD Apparatus   \n\n \n\nThe EPD set up used in this work is presented in Figure 4-2. It is composed of the \n\nEPD cell, the ultrasonic bath and the power source. The home made EPD cell consists of \n\nthree main parts: the base, the mask and the metal pole for conductive connection. \n\nPlatinum foils of 11 \u00d711 \u00d7 0.025 mm (99.95%, Good fellow, UK) were used as substrate \n\nfor the film deposition and as counter electrode (cathode) as well. The substrates were \n\nplaced between the each mask chambers and screwed from the back with the back lid. The \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\ntwo equal masks were mounted on the base, and the two steel poles provided the electrical \n\nconnection to the external power source. As represented in Figure 4-2 on the left side of \n\nthe EPD cell is the ultrasonic bath (Branson, USA) and on right side the DC power source \n\n(EPS, Stromversorgung Gmbh, Germany); the EPD cell is located at the top of the \n\nmagnetic stirrer. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4-2: EPD setup in the left side and the EPD mask on the right side. \n\n \n\n4.4 Deposition of Films \n\nFor film deposition, the EPD cell was immersed in the suspension in a 250 ml of \n\nglass beaker. The platinum foil as working electrode (cathode) was separated by 2 cm \n\nfrom the Pt counter electrode (anode) in the EPD cell. \n\n \n\nPrior to each EPD cycle the suspensions were ultrasonically dispersed and \n\nmagnetically stirred (Yellowline, IKA Werke GmbH &amp; Co. KG Germany) for 2 to 5 min, \n\nfollowed by settling for 1-2 min in order to settle down of coarse particles. \n\n \n\nConstant voltage and constant time mode was used in the current work to deposit \n\nBLT and BNT films on Platinum foil. The electric current through the EPD cell was \n\nmonitored by a digital multimeter (MY-64, MASTECH, Hong Kong) located in series \n\nwith the EPD circuit, during the EPD process. \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT composites films were fabricated on platinum substrate \n\nby electrophoretic deposition, as well. The deposition was carried out in acetone based \n\nsuspension with triethanolamine as an additive for both systems. Composite films were \n\ndeposited layer by layer, namely a BLT layer followed by a BNT layer and the other way \n\naround, a BNT layer followed by a BLT one. After each deposition and prior to the second \n\ndeposition films were dried for at least one day in desiccators so that acetone evaporates \n\nslowly and minimise the formation of pores. A systematic diagram of the composite \n\npreparation is presented in Figure. 4-3. Isostatic pressing was not performed on the \n\ncomposite thick films because in many cases it leads to the peal off of the films.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-3: Schematic diagram of BNT/BLT thick film composite preparation. \n\n \n\nThe geometrical density of green films was calculated by calculating the volume of \n\nthe deposited film and measuring the weight of deposited film. The density is given by  \n\n                                    ? = M / V                                                                      (4-1) \n\nwhere M stands for the mass of the film and V for the volume.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Drying, Compaction and Sintering \n\nBLT, BNT and composites films were dried at room temperature for more than \n\n24h. Drying in air was preferred over a drying in the oven to let the solvent to evaporate \n\nslowly and to minimise the possibility of creating cracks. After drying, the films were iso-\n\nstatically pressed at 200 MPa for 3-5min to increase their green density. \n\n+ - + - \n\nBNT in acetone  based \n\nsuspension, 1\nst\n step  \n\nBLT in acetone based \n\nsuspension, 2\nnd\n\n Step  \n\nBNT/BLT \n\nFilm BNT Film \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nThe dried and compact films were further sintered at high temperature. To \n\ndetermine the sintering temperature for both systems dilatometric analysis of BLT and \n\nBNT pressed pellets (5x5x7 mm) were conducted in a computer assisted vertical \n\ndilatometer (Linseis, mod. 4 L70-2000).  \n\n \n\nThe thickness of the green and sintered films was measured by a micrometer and \n\nthe film thickness error was calculated by taking the average of the first deposition \n\nthickness carried out at four different times in four fresh prepared suspension of BLT in \n\nacetone with triethanolamine. The calculated error associated with the film thickness is \n\napproximately \u00b1 1.75\u00b5m  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fabrication of Ceramics \n\nFor comparison with films, BLT ceramic discs were prepared. The discs of 0.5g  \n\nwere uniaxially pressed at 50 MPa (Carver Laboratory Press, Fred S. Carver Inc., USA) \n\nand further isostatically pressed at 200MPa for a high and homogeneous green density. The \n\npressed discs were sintered from 1400\u00baC to 1600\u00baC for different periods of time to assess \n\nthe effect of the microstructure on the properties like permittivity, TC?r and loss tangent. \n\nDensity of sintered discs was measured by Archimedes principle in diethyl phthalate \n\n(Fluke, 80080 with density of 1.118g/cm\n3\n). For dielectric measurements metal-insulator- \n\nmetal geometry was used and top and bottom gold electrodes were deposited by thermal \n\nevaporation on the tops of the ceramic disk. \n\n \n\n4.7 Sample Characterization \n\nStructure and Microstructure \n\nThe phase assemblage of the sintered BLT films and ceramics and BNT/BLT \n\ncomposite films was analysed by XRD. \n\n \n\nThe microstructure evolution was followed by Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\n(SEM). For that cross-sections and surface morphologies of BLT, BNT, BNT/BLT and \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nBLT/BNT films were analyzed by a Hitachi S-4100 SEM coupled with energy dispersive \n\nspectroscopy (EDS). Film specimens were mounted on aluminium stubs using carbon glue. \n\nCarbon paint was applied to the specimen to provide a conductive path, and to avoid \n\ncharging of the sample inside the microscope. These samples were investigated using an \n\noperation voltage of 25 kV.  \n\n \n\nTo view the cross section of films, a sandwich structure was constructed. The \n\nflexible films were supported by gluing a rigid alumina slide on both sides of the films. \n\nThe supported film was fixed in to the epoxy resin for polishing. Films cross sections and \n\nfractured surfaces of the ceramic samples were polished by 1200 grade emery paper \n\nfollowed by a fine polishing in which sub sequential low grade diamond pastes (from 15 \n\n?m, 6 ?m, 3 ?m, 1 ?m and 0.25 ?m) were used. After the polishing an acid mixture of 5% \n\nHF + 45% HCl in 50% of water was used to chemically etch the polished films cross \n\nsections and to contrast the grain boundaries. Finally, the as-etched samples were cleaned \n\nby ultrasonication in acetone. The polished ceramic samples were thermally etched at \n\ntemperatures 100 \u00baC below the corresponding sintering temperature for 10 min. In case of \n\nfilms the surfaces were analysed without any treatment. \n\n \n\nDielectric Characterization \n\nIn this work, the electrical measurements at RF frequency were conducted via a \n\nmetal-insulator-metal (MIM) configuration using Au as the top electrode for both films and \n\nceramics. For the case of films, Au top circular electrodes were sputtered using a shadow \n\nmask of 0.6 mm diameter. Films of BNT, BLT and composites with top electrodes were \n\npost-annealed at 200 \u00baC for 30 min to improve the interface between the metal and the \n\nfilms. In BLT ceramics, top and bottom Au electrodes of 5.5 mm diameter were sputtered. \n\n \n\nThe complex permittivity at RF frequency was measured as a function of \n\ntemperature and frequency in capacitive cells as illustrated in Figure 4-4. The electrical \n\nproperties were evaluated using an impedance bridge (HP 4284A, Agilent, USA) over a \n\nfrequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The oscillation level of the applied voltage was set to \n\n1.0 V. The analysed electrical properties include the relative permittivity, loss tangent, \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\ntemperature dependence of permittivity (??r/?r0?T,) and relative permittivity-voltage \n\nvariation (?r-V). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4-4: Equivalent circuit diagrams of capacitive cell (a), of charging and loss current (b), and of \n\nloss tangent for a typical dielectric (c) [1] \n\n \n\nError Calculation  \n\nDielectric measurements were carried out in 5 to 6 different points along the film. \n\nThe presented values of dielectric permittivity and dielectric losses correspond to the \n\naverage of all the measurements and the error associate was calculated to be \u00b1 3.9 for the \n\ndielectric permittivity and 0.0035 for the dielectric losses. \n\nFigure 4-5 and Table 4-1 present the dielectric permittivity values and losses for \n\nBLT films sintered at 1500\u00baC for 1h measured at six different points.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne\n\n p\ne\n\nrm\nit\n\nti\nv\n\nit\ny\n\nFrequency(Hz)\n\nBLT film \n\nAcetone+Triethanolamine\n\nSintering temperature 1500\no\n\nC-1h\n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-5: Relative permittivity as a function of frequency for BLT film sintered at 1500\u00baC-1h derived \n\nfrom acetone with triethanolamine additive.  \n\n \n\nTable 4-1: Relative permittivity at 1MHz in six points along the BLT film deposited in acetone with \n\ntriethanolamine additive. \n\n \nMeasurement \n\npoint \n\nPermittivity \n\nat 1MhZ \nLoss tangent \n\n1 42.7 0.003 \n\n2 47.1 0.002 \n\n3 44.6 0.008 \n\n4 40.8 0.002 \n\n5 47.3 0.009 \n\n6 46.1 0.009 \n\n  \n\n \n\n4.8 References \n\n[1] Fu Zhi, ?BaNd2Ti5O14 Thick Films for Microelectronics Fabricated by Electrophoretic \n\nDeposition?

The powders are \n\ncharacterized in term of its phase content, thermal behaviour, particle size distribution and \n\nmorphology. \n\n \n\n5.1 Introduction:  \n\nAs discussed in the Chapter 6 of the thesis a key aspect of EPD is the stability of \n\nthe suspension and charge state of the particles. This behaviour is intimately related with \n\nthe morphology of the powder particles, what justifies the need of a complete \n\ncharacterization of the powders. In the meantime, as pointed in Chapter 5 the phase \n\nformation process in BNT and BLT systems is a complex process. In order to guarantee \n\nthat BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (1:1:4) (BNT) powders have been \n\nsynthesised the structural and phase assembly characterization is necessary. \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\n5.2 DTA and TG \n\n The mixed precursors of BLT and BNT were analysed by DTA and TG to obtain \n\ninformation on the approximated calcination temperature and Figure 5-1 represents the \n\nDTA and TG curves of both powders.  \n\n \n\nThree main peaks are observed in the DTA curve of BNT and two main plateaus in \n\nthe TG curve. The first endothermic peak near to 100\no\nC corresponds to the dehydration of \n\nthe starting reagents and is accompanied by the corresponding losses in the TG curve, until \n\naround 300\u00baC. A second quite diffuse exothermic peak ranging from 400 to almost 800\no\nC \n\ncorresponds to decomposition of carbon dioxide from BaCO3 and is accompanied by a \n\nmarked decrease in the weight losses between 700 and 850\u00baC. A third peak exothermic \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\npeak can be denoted between 900\no\nC and 1000\n\no\nC for which no weight loss is recorded and \n\ncorresponds to the phase completeness of BNT phase formation.  \n\n \n\nFour main peaks are observed in the DTA curve of BLT and three main plateaus in \n\nthe TG curve. The first endothermic peak near to 100\no\nC corresponds to the dehydration of \n\nthe starting reagents and is accompanied by the corresponding losses in the TG curve. A \n\nsecond quite endothermic peak ranging from 390\u00baC which corresponds to the dehydration \n\nof La(OH)3 to form LaO3 and La2O2(CO3) which accompanied by the loss followed by a \n\nsmall weight gain in the TG curve. The third peak of around 1000\no\nC corresponds to \n\ndecomposition of carbon dioxide and is accompanied by a marked decrease in the weight \n\nlosses between 900 and 1050\u00baC.

The morphology of the particles is depicted in the SEM \n\nmicrographs of Figure 5-4; clearly BLT particles are bigger than the BNT ones and exhibit \n\na more or less platelet like shape when compared with the rod like morphology of BNT.  \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4  BLT 12hr\n\nMedian = 0.635 \n\n BNT 12hr\n\nMedian = 0.643\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n P\n\ne\nrc\n\ne\nn\n\nta\ng\n\ne\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nDiameter(\u00b5m)\n\n \n\nFigure 5-3: Particle size versus volume percentage for BNT and BLT powders. \n\n \n\n  \n\n   (a)       (b) \n\nFigure 5-4: SEM micrographs of the powder particles of a) BLT b) BNT \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n5.5 Dilatometeric Measurement  \n\nDilatometry analysis of BNT and BLT powders is illustrated in Figure 5-5 which \n\ndepicts the change in the length (?l/l0 x 100%, l0 stands for the initial length and ?l for the \n\nvariation of the length) with the temperature.

Suspensions based on water, ethanol, and acetone were employed and \n\nanalyzed for the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of BLT and BNT powders. The effect of \n\nsuspension additives on film\u2019s deposition is studied. It is observed that ethanol with HNO3 \n\nand acetone with triethanolamine are suitable suspension media for the deposition of BLT \n\nthick films, while in case of BNT, optimised deposited films, are achieved when acetone \n\nwith triethanolamine is used. .The suspension stability behaviour is studied by means of \n\nthe particle size distribution, UV transmittance and zeta potential. The deposition \n\nparameters like voltage and time and a post deposition isostatic press step are analysed in \n\norder to control the final thickness and green density of the films. \n\n \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\nAs described in Chapter 2, the fabrication of thick films with optimised properties \n\ndepends on factors, such as stability, zeta potential, viscosity and dielectric constant of the \n\nsuspension and applied voltage and deposition time (inter alia), it is important to study this \n\nparameter. \n\n \n\nIn a previous work of the present group the fabrication by EPD of BNT(1:1:5) thick \n\nfilms was reported [1]. It was observed that in terms of films quality (Figure 6-1) the \n\noptimised properties were achieved for acidic media in acetone containing iodine with \n\ndielectric properties superior than BNT ceramics. It was than proved the applicability of \n\nEPD for the fabrication of functional thick films, what was viewed as the step forward for \n\nthe miniaturisation of the microwave devices.  \n\n \n\nHowever the fabrication of BLT thick films by EPD has not yet been reported. It is \n\nthen very opportune and scientifically and technically interesting to prove the adequacy of \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nthe use of EPD to fabricate low loss BLT thick films and to compare their properties with \n\nthose of BNT thick films on metal foils. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6-1: Deposited thickness of BNT films as a function of applied voltage in acetone with iodine [1] \n\n \n\n6.2 Experiments \n\n BLT and BNT powders were used to prepare the suspensions for EPD. The \n\nfabrication, morphology and characterization of the powders were discussed in detail in the \n\nexperimental Chapters 4 and 5. \n\n \n\nBLT and BNT (1:1:4) powder suspensions were prepared in acetone, ethanol and \n\nwater. And additives such as nitric acid and triethanolamine were used to vary the pH of \n\nthe suspension from acidic to basic and to vary the particle charges. The stability of each of \n\nthese suspensions was inspected by UV transmittance spectroscopy and particle size \n\nanalysis. For all the suspension media the suspensions prepared for transmittance \n\nspectroscopy had a similar concentration, which is an important requisite for a comparative \n\nanalysis. The films were deposited under constant time and constant voltage.  \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\n6.3 The Role of Suspension Media in the Deposition of BLT and BNT Thick Films \n\nSome physical properties (like viscosity, dielectric constant) of the suspension \n\nmedia used in this work (acetone, ethanol and water) are indicated in Table 6-1, together \n\nwith the macroscopic observation regarding the deposition. It was observed that with the \n\napplication of voltage, BLT and BNT particles move to negative electrode for organic \n\nbased medium where as for water based suspension no movement was observed.  \n\n \n\nPower et al. [2] stated that for solvents with low dielectric constant the dissociative \n\ncharging mode is insufficient and as a consequence no deposition occurs; however in the \n\npresence of high dielectric constant solvents the ionic concentration increases in the \n\nsuspension, reduces the size of the double layer region and consequently the stability, \n\ntherefore non aqueous media with medium dielectric constant such as acetone and ethanol, \n\nare in general effective for EPD.  \n\n \n\nUnder the current EPD experiments the solid loading is quite low so the viscosity \n\ncannot be used as a parameter to evaluate the dispersion state [4-5]. \n\n \n\nTable 6-1: Physical properties of the suspension media used in the preparation of BNT and BLT \n\nsuspensions for EPD. \n\nSuspension  media \n\nwith additives(HNO3 \n\nand Triethanolamine) \n\nDielectric \n\nconstant \n\nViscosity \n\n(cP)=10\n-3\n\n N s \n\nm\n-2\n\n \n\nEPD deposition BLT/ BNT \n\n \n\nAcetone \n\n \n\nEthanol \n\n \n\nWater  \n\n \n\n \n\n20.7 \n\n \n\n24.3 \n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\n0.306 \n\n \n\n1.22 \n\n \n\n0.89 \n\n \n\nVery Good / Very good \n\n \n\n   Good / No deposition \n\n \n\nNo deposition / No deposition \n\n \n\n \n\nThe pH of water based suspensions and operational pH of the organic-based \n\nsuspensions were measured by means of a pH meter. The operational pH of the BLT and \n\nBNT suspension in ethanol and acetone was controlled by additions of diluted nitric acid \n\n(1:10) and triethanolamine (>99.8%, Merck). The pH values for BNT and BLT suspension \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nmedia are indicated in Table 6-2, the pH value for pure acetone and ethanol is 7.97 and \n\n7.09 respectively.  \n\n \n\nTable 6-2: The pH values for BNT and BLT in organic media with and without additives. \n\nSystem Suspension media Additive pH \n\nBLT Ethanol ------- 6.51 \n\nBLT Ethanol dil.

The zeta potential for pH values 2-3 is near to 58mV, which means a high \n\nmobility of the particles in suspension and may result in a good deposition. As the pH \n\nincreases the zeta potential decreases and the isoelectric point is attained for pH values of \n\n8.7  \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nZ\ne\n\nta\n P\n\no\nte\n\nn\nti\n\na\nl \n\n(m\nV\n\n)\n\npH\n\n BLT in ethanol \n\n \n\nFigure 6-2: Zeta potential versus pH for BLT suspension in ethanol. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nA good deposition was observed for BLT in ethanol based suspensions with pH \n\nvalue near to 2 as can be seen from the optical image of films morphology depicted in \n\nFigure 6-3. For BNT in acidic media no deposition was observed.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Surface morphology of BLT films deposited in ethanol suspension media with HNO3, \n\nunder 100V for 1min  \n\n \n\nIn acetone based suspensions no deposition was observed for acidic media but for \n\nthe basic media with pH 8-8.9 very good deposition was observed for both BLT and BNT \n\nsystems, as can be seen in optical image depicted in Figures 6-4 and 6-5.  \n\n \n\nTo study the electrophoretic deposition of BLT and BNT particles with basic pH, \n\ntriethanolamine as an additive was used in acetone based suspensions. The choice of \n\nacetone over ethanol was made based on their pH values; pure acetone shows pH of 7.97 \n\nand with the addition of BNT particles the pH values increase for the BNT near to 8.2. In \n\ncase of ethanol media, with the addition of BLT particles the pH of the suspension shifts \n\ntowards lower value 6.51 (acidic), so by taking pH behaviour in account acetone was \n\npreferred over ethanol for basic deposition. \n\n  \n\nThe zeta potential for BNT and BLT in pure acetone is 16.6mV and 15mV \n\nrespectively. To enhance the surface charge on the particles triethanolamine was added to \n\nBNT and BLT suspension which further increase the suspension pH to 8.90 and 8.50 \n\nrespectively (Table 6-2). \n\n \n\nFor the basic suspensions, i.e. acetone with triethanolamine, the deposition \n\noccurred at the negative electrode. In order to understand the mechanism behind the charge \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nprocess of BNT and BLT particles under these basic conditions zeta potential curves \n\nshould be acquired, but due to experimental limitations of the equipment available at the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro, these curves could only be obtained in water. However similar good \n\nanodic depositions were reported in the work of Widegren et al. [7] for the deposition of \n\nAl2O and TiO2 particles in ethanol based suspension with triethanolamine. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4: Surface morphology of BLT films deposited in acetone suspension media with \n\ntriethanolamine, under 60V for 1 min. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-5: Surface morphology of BNT films deposited in acetone suspension media with \ntriethanolamine, under 60V for 1min.  \n\n \n\nIt is worthwhile to note here that no deposition was observed in the case of water, \n\npure ethanol and pure acetone based suspensions. The reasons behind these occurrences \n\ncannot be easily evaluated because of the complexity of EPD and are still a matter of \n\ndebate. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nHowever the following analysis can contribute to explain some of these \n\nobservations. \n\n6.4 Suspension Stability \n\nThe particle size distribution in different media (water, ethanol and acetone) is \n\ndepicted in Figure 6-6 for the BLT system. As expected BLT particles show dissimilar \n\ndispersion characteristics in the different suspension media. The stability analysis was \n\nperformed in water as well, so that it can be used as a reference. A bimodal distribution \n\nwas observed for all the suspension media under study with and without additives. \n\nHowever the volume percentage of particles varied for each media. A lower percentage of \n\nparticles in the range of 2 to 6\u00b5m and a higher percentage of particles in the range below \n\n1\u00b5m were observed in organic media when compared with the water based one. This \n\nclearly indicates that the tendency for particle agglomeration in water is higher than in \n\norganic media, supporting the better stability of BLT powders in organic suspensions. The \n\naddition of additives in acetone and ethanol further increase the volume percentage of \n\nsmaller size particles as expected, which assures a good EPD. \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n(%\n\n)\n\nParticle Diameter (\u00b5m)\n\n BLT+Water\n\n BLT+Ethanol\n\n BLT+Ethanol+HNO\n3\n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n(%\n\n)\n\nParticle Diameter (\u00b5m)\n\n BLT+Water\n\n BLT+Acetone\n\n BLT+Acetone+Triethanolamine\n\n \n(b) \n\n     \nFigure 6-6: Volume percentage of particles versus particle diameter for BLT a) in ethanol and b) \n\nacetone media with and without additives. \n\n \n\nFor BNT suspensions, considerable changes can be distinguished for the case of \n\norganic suspension media acetone as compared to water presented in Figure 6-7. Similarly \n\nto BLT, BNT suspensions exhibit a bimodal distribution in all the suspension media. \n\nHowever in water the volume percentage of particles in the range between 2 and 6.5?m is \n\nhigher and lower for the submicron range when compared with the other suspension \n\nmedia; a narrower distribution was indeed observed for the acetone based suspension, \n\nwhere the highest volume percentage of particles are smaller than 0.6?m. The addition of \n\ntriethanolamine to acetone did not provoke a marked effect on the particle size distribution, \n\njust a minor increase in the volume percentage of the small size particles.  \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n(%\n\n)\n\nParticle diameter(\u00b5m)\n\n BNT+Water\n\n BNT+Acetone\n\n BNT+Acetone+Triethanolamine\n\n \nFigure 6-7: Volume percentage of particles versus particle diameter for BNT in acetone media with \n\nand without additives. \n\n \n\nTo prepare a well dispersed BLT and BNT suspension for EPD and to obtain a \n\ndense coating, a fine particle size suspension is required and BLT suspensions in ethanol \n\nand acetone and BNT suspension in acetone with additives present indeed relatively good \n\nresults then in ethanol. \n\n \n\nThe stability of the suspensions with time was further studied by UV transmittance. \n\nThe transmission results in acetone, ethanol and water suspension with and without \n\nadditives for both systems are plotted in Figure 6-8 (a) and (b). \n\n \n\nAs high the transmission value is, as less stable the suspension will be. For BLT \n\nethanol based suspensions, the transmittance percentage was 28% for the case of water, \n\n23% in ethanol and 22 % in ethanol with HNO3 addition. The waiting time was of 1 minute \n\nbefore every measurement. The lower transmission observed in the case of ethanol based \n\nsuspension indicates a better dispersion of the particles in suspension and corroborates the \n\nresults of the particle size distribution, presented above. The transmittance percentage \n\nincreases with time for all the suspensions which is related with the sedimentation of the \n\nsuspended particles as the time passes. However, this increase is less visible for the case of \n\nthe water based suspension due to the fact that, under the same experimental conditions, \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\nthe amount of the coarse particles in suspension is very few in the water based suspensions, \n\nbecause they settled almost immediately, i.e. in the first seconds of settling.  \n\nFor BLT in acetone based suspensions, the transmittance decreases from 20 % to \n\n12% with the addition of triethanolamine which indicates a very good dispersion degree of \n\nthe suspension as compared to the suspension without additives, as previously observed for \n\nthe other additives, what ensures a good stability for the BLT suspension in acetone with \n\ntriethanolamine. These observations validate the results obtained from the particle size \n\ndistribution in which the volume percentage of small sized particles slightly increases with \n\nthe addition of triethanolamine. \n\n \n\nThe transmittance results demonstrate that in ethanol and acetone based \n\nsuspensions of BLT, some particles settle down after 7-10 min which might not be a matter \n\nof concern as deposition is carried out immediately after stirring and in the first few \n\nminutes of the settling of the suspension. \n\n \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nT\nra\n\nn\ns\n\nm\nit\n\nta\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n(%\n)\n\nTime(sec)\n\n BLT+Water\n\n BLT+Ethanol\n\n BLT+Ethanol+HNO\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nT\nra\n\nn\ns\n\nm\nit\n\nta\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n(%\n)\n\nTime(sec)\n\n BLT+Water\n\n BLT+Acetone\n\n BLT+Acetone+ Triethanolamine\n\n \n\n \n\n \n(b) \n\n \nFigure 6-8: UV transmittance versus time for BLT suspensions in a) ethanol b) acetone with and \n\nwithout additives. \n\n \n\nThe stability behaviour of BNT suspensions in different suspension media is \n\ndepicted in Figures 6-9. As observed for BLT, BNT water based suspension presents the \n\nhighest transmittance values, indicating the less stable suspension when compared with \n\nequivalent suspensions in acetone and ethanol. Indeed, the transmittance percentage of \n\nBNT drops from 27% in water to 11% in acetone and acetone with additives. In \n\nsuspensions with additives the particles stay stable for longer periods of time as compared \n\nto the ones without additives, ensuring better suspension stability for the EPD. The very \n\nsmall differences in the transmittance percentage between BNT acetone based suspensions \n\nwith and without additives are in good agreement with the particle size distribution results \n\n(Figure 6-7) in which the volume percentage of the particles distributed in both media is \n\nalmost equal. \n\n \n\nThe above presented results of particle size analysis and UV transmittance gave a \n\nclear idea about the stability of the organic based suspensions and about their \n\nappropriateness to be used in the flowing steps of the film deposition.  \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n BNT+Water\n\n BNT+Acetone\n\n BNT+Acetone+Triethanlamine\nT\n\nra\nn\n\ns\nm\n\nit\nta\n\nn\nc\n\ne\n(%\n\n)\n\nTime(sec)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6-9: UV transmittance versus time for BNT suspensions in acetone with and without additives. \n\n \n\n6.5 The Role of the Deposition Parameters on the EPD of BLT and BNT Thick Films  \n\nAs well documented in the introduction there are several processing variables that \n\naffect the properties and quality of the deposited films. The knowledge of the effect of \n\nthese variables is crucial to control the kinetics and the deposition process and the final \n\ncharacteristics of the films. For that, BLT and BNT films were deposited under varied \n\ndeposition conditions, namely voltage and time. \n\n \n\nThe effect of the deposition voltage and time for BLT in ethanol with HNO3 \n\nadditions is presented in Figure 6-10, in which the variation of the film thickness is plotted \n\nagainst the time for a fixed deposition voltage and plotted against the voltage, for a fixed \n\ndeposition time.  \n\n \n\nFor constant voltage with time the film thickness increases linearly until 60\u00b5m and \n\nthen starts to deviate from linearity for longer deposition times. The observed deviation is \n\ndue to the decrease in the electric field between the electrodes because of deposited layer \n\nof particles on the substrate or to the change in the charge concentration of the suspension \n\nas the deposition goes on [5]. For constant time and varying deposition voltage the \n\nthickness of film increased more or less linearly for the voltage range from 60 to120V and \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\ndeviates from this linear behaviour for higher voltages. It is well known that with the \n\nincrease of the deposition voltage the particles will be animated of high velocities and will \n\ntravel very fast towards the counter charged electrode deteriorating the packing of the \n\nparticles on the substrate and limiting the film thickness increase and the deposition of a \n\nclosed packed structure. In addition the increased voltage may cause turbulence in the \n\nsuspension, which results in non uniform surface and bulk films [6]. It was even observed \n\nthat at high voltage the films tend to peeled off from the substrate. \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nT\nh\n\nic\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n(\u00b5\n\nm\n)\n\nTime(sec.)\n\n Voltage=100V\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nT\nh\n\nic\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n(\u00b5\n\nm\n)\n\nVoltage(V)\n\n Time = 1min\n\n \n\n \n\n \n (b)  \n\nFigure 6-10: Deposited thickness of BLT films in ethanol with diluted nitric acid as a function of (a) \n\nconstant voltage (b) constant time. \n\n \n\nThe topography of films deposited in ethanol was not uniform and especially for \n\nhigh film thickness as shown in Figure 6-3. The geometrical density of green films \n\ndeposited in ethanol suspension was in between 26% to 32% of theoretical density. \n\n \n\nThe effect of the deposition voltage and deposition time on the properties of BLT \n\nfilms was carried out in basic media, as well. \n\n \n\nFigure 6-11 represents the variation of BLT film thickness as a function of voltage \n\nand time for acetone with triethanolamine suspension media. As previously observed the \n\nthickness of the films deposited under constant voltage (60 V) for varied deposition times \n\nand under fixed deposition time (1 min) for varied deposition voltages, increases for initial \n\ndeposition time and voltage and then the rate of thickness decreases as the deposition time \n\nor deposition voltage increases. Under 60V the maximum thickness achieved under the \n\npresent conditions was about 55\u00b5m for 120sec and for longer deposition times the films \n\npeeled off from the substrate. \n\n   \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nT\nh\n\nic\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n(\u00b5\n\nm\n)\n\nTime(sec.)\n\n Voltage= 60V\n\n \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n\n60 70 80 90 100\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nT\nh\n\nic\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n(\u00b5\n\nm\n)\n\nVoltage(V)\n\n Time=1min\n\n \n\n \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 6-11: Deposited thickness of BLT films in acetone with triethanolamine as a function of (a) \n\nconstant voltage (b) and constant time  \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nThis non linear behaviour is further supported by the results depicted for BLT in \n\nFigure 6-12, in which the variation of the suspension electric current is measured during \n\nthe deposition and the deposit weight is plotted against the deposition time. For both \n\nvariables the variation is asymptotical, indicating a decrease of the rate of the variation. \n\nThe decrease of the rate of the deposit weight with time can be explained, on one hand by \n\nthe decrease in the particle velocity with time related with the decrease of the current in the \n\nsuspension media as the deposition time passes, on the other hand as a result of the \n\ndeposited mass on the electrode which acts as a shield for the incoming particles [5]. The \n\ncurrent was dropped from 7.9mA to 7.5mA with time because of the insulating layer \n\ncreated by deposited particles on the substrate.  \n\n \n\nBLT films derived from acetone with triethanolamine and presented in Figure 6-4 \n\nexhibit more uniform surface topography than BLT films derived from ethanol with nitric \n\nacid suspension media. The geometrical density of green films deposited from acetone \n\nwith triethanolamine was in the range of 42% to 48% of theoretical density, considerably \n\nhigher than the density of the BLT films prepared from the ethanol based suspension by \n\napproximately 10%. \n\n \n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.010\n\n0.012\n\n0.014\n\n0.016\n\n0.018\n\n0.020\n\n7.5\n\n7.6\n\n7.7\n\n7.8\n\n7.9\n\n8.0\n\n \n\n Deposit weight\n\nD\ne\n\np\no\n\ns\nit\n\n w\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt(\ng\n\n)\n\nTime (sec)\n\n Current\n\nC\nu\n\nrr\ne\n\nn\nt(\n\nm\nA\n\n)\n\n \nFigure 6-12: Deposited weight and suspension current as a function of time for BLT in acetone with \n\ntriethanolamine.  \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nAs mentioned before the fabrication of BNT films was thoroughly studied in \n\nprevious works of this group [1] and in this thesis the preparation of BNT thick films was \n\ncarried out only as a mean to achieve optimised fabrication of BNT / BLT and BLT / BNT \n\nthick composite films. BNT deposition was carried out in acetone with the addition of \n\ntriethanolamine and under high pH values. Very uniform deposits were formed at the \n\nnegative electrode in a similar way to the BLT system under basic conditions. \n\n \n\nThe deposition parameters like, voltage, current and time were analysed to control \n\nthe films properties. In Figure 6-13 film thickness is plotted as a function of time and \n\napplied voltage for constant applied voltage and time respectively. A similar variation to \n\nthe previously described BLT behaviour is observed. This nonlinearity in the thickness \n\nvariation was also reported for other systems like ZnO by Wang et al. [6].  \n\n \n\nThe deposited weight and suspension electric current as a function of the deposition \n\ntime are depicted in Figure 6-14.

It was observed that with the increase of the green \n\nfilm thickness the surface become more inhomogeneous and after sintering some cracks \n\nwere formed as shown in Figure 6-15. For thickness lower than 50\u00b5m the surfaces of the \n\nfilms were uniform and crack free after and before sintering. The cause of cracking in the \n\ncase of higher thickness film may be due to development of stresses during the constrained \n\nsintering process, to the increased non uniformity of the green microstructure of the films \n\nas the film thickness increases and also to drying step that is more difficult in the thick than \n\nin the thin films. \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\n  \n     (a)               (b)  \nFigure 6-15: SEM micrograph of BLT film, top view with thickness a) >50\u00b5m b)&lt;50\u00b5m  \n\n6.6 Post Deposition Treatment \n\nIn generally, EPD process produces a porous layer of compacted powder and in \n\norder to enhance the density of the films, a post-deposition cold isostatic pressing (CIP) \n\nstep was employed. \n\n \n\nAlthough alternative approaches to enhance the sintered density of the films can be \n\nused, that include increasing the sintering temperature or introducing liquid phase sintering \n\naids, these are not so attractive for the present studies. Due to the thermal expansion \n\nmismatch between the films and the substrate increasing the sintering temperatures will \n\ninvariably lead to the formation of cracks and for case of sintering aids the dielectric losses \n\ncan easily increase. \n\n \n\nFigure 6-16 illustrates the SEM micrographs of BLT and BNT films sintered at \n\n1450\u00ba/6h and 1450\u00baC/1h without and with CIP treatment at 200 MPa, respectively. The \n\nlower porosity of the CIP films is clearly seen when compared to the non CIP films. The \n\ndielectric properties of the corresponding films are depicted in Figure 6-17; the permittivity \n\ndecreases and losses increases by factor of 5 to 10 for both BLT and BNT films prepared \n\nwithout CIP step. The CIP step is proved to be very effective in terms of green \n\ndensification and, as a consequence, in terms of final dielectric response. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\n  \n   (c)      (d) \nFigure 6-16: SEM micrograph of BLT(a,b) and BNT(c,d) sintered at 1450\u00baC/6h and 1450\u00baC/1h resp.  \n\na-c) without CIP  and b-d) with CIP. \n\n \n\n \n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nRelative permittivity\n\n With CIP\n\n Without CIP\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n p\n\ne\nrm\n\nit\nti\n\nv\nit\n\ny\n\nFrequency(Hz)\n\n L\no\n\ns\ns\n t\n\na\nn\n\ng\ne\nn\n\nt\n\nLoss Tangent\n\n With CIP\n\n Without CIP\n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n-0.01\n\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.07\n\n0.08\n\n0.09\n\nRelative permittivity\n\n With CIP\n\n Without CIP\nR\n\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n P\n\ne\nrm\n\nit\nti\n\nv\nit\n\ny\n\nFrequency(Hz)\n\nLoss tangent\n\n With CIP\n\n Without CIP\n\n L\no\n\ns\ns\n t\n\na\nn\n\ng\ne\n\nn\nt\n\n \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 6-17: Relative permittivity and losses as a function of frequency in a) BLT b) BNT films \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n6.7 Conclusion \n\nBLT and BNT thick films were successfully deposited on the platinum substrates \n\nby EPD.  \n\n \n\nBecause the mechanism of EPD involves charged particles in a suspension being \n\ndeposited onto an electrode under the influence of an applied electric field two groups of \n\nparameters determine the characteristics of this process: (i) those related to the suspension, \n\nand (ii) those related to the process including the physical parameters such as the electrical \n\nnature of the electrodes, the electrical conditions (voltage/intensity relationship, deposition \n\ntime, etc.).  \n\n \n\nIn this chapter the role of suspension media and of deposition parameters (such as \n\nvoltage and time) was assessed in the deposition of BLT and BNT thick films. \n\nIt was verified that BLT thick films can be successfully deposited either in acidic \n\nand basic media of ethanol and acetone, respectively. However BNT, films were only \n\nobtained in basic suspension media of acetone with triethanolamine. Diluted nitric acid and \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\ntriethanolamine were used to vary the pH of the suspension and proved to be very useful in \n\ncontrolling the stability of the suspension and the quality of the deposit. \n\n \n\nLow pH ethanol with nitric acid suspensions and high pH acetone with \n\nthriethanolamine suspensions are quite stable and allow a good dispersion of the powders \n\nparticles, as indicated by the particle size distribution and UV transmittance studies. \n\n \n\nFor both systems the relation between the processing parameters (deposition \n\nvoltage and time) and physical characteristics of green films was established. Under the \n\npresent conditions films with thickness up to 80\u00b5m can be fabricated for both the systems \n\nwith application of constant voltage and varying the deposition time, being the films with \n\nthickness up to 50\u00b5m characterised by very uniform morphologies. \n\n \n\nWith CIP, the films are denser and exhibit approximately 20% higher permittivity \n\nthan films without CIP; this proves that CIP is an essential step to ensure thick films good \n\nproperties. \n\n \n\n6.8 References \n\n [1] Fu Zhi, ?BaNd2Ti5O14 Thick Films for Microelectronics Fabricated by Electrophoretic \n\nDeposition?

Since BLT thick films are prepared for the first time in this work, \n\nBLT ceramics are fabricated as well and their dielectric properties compared. For \n\nequivalent sintering temperature it is observed that the grain growth in films is more \n\nanisotropic because of the film\u2019s constrained sintering. As a consequence, the dielectric \n\npermittivity is higher in films (by 11 %) when compared with ceramics where grains are \n\nmore randomly distributed, at this sintering temperature. The losses measured for BLT \n\nceramics and films, in this work are more or less 0.002 at 1MHz frequency. \n\n \n\n The microstructure and electrical properties of BNT films were not addressed in \n\nthis work because it had been previously a research topic in the group [8].  \n\n \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\nIt is well known that the processing steps of the material will affect its final \n\nmicrostructure and, as a consequence, the final dielectric properties. The establishment of \n\nthe relationships between the processing, microstructure and properties is crucial for the \n\nunderstanding and control of the material response and for its application and \n\ncommercialization, as well.  \n\n \n\n In addition in view of the fact that BLT thick films have not yet been reported in \n\nthe literature and generally the properties of films are inferior to the properties of the \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nequivalent bulk ceramics, the dielectric response of BLT thick films and BLT ceramics is \n\nanalysed and compared. \n\nDespite the technological interest of BLT ceramics with a ?r of 44, TC?r near zero \n\nand Qf above 44,000 [5], systematic studies on the processing of BLT ceramics are still not \n\nthoroughly described in the literature. The dielectric properties of BLT systems have been \n\nreported by several groups as mentioned in Chapter 1, and the discussions have been \n\nmainly focused on the tunning of tf without degrading the ?r and Qf of the material. Colla \n\net al [2] and Reaney et al. [3] have shown that tf varies strongly in accordance with the \n\nproximity of room temperature due to phase transitions that involve tilting or rotation of \n\n\u00b4O\u00b4 octahedral unit of the structure this studies were conducted on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 \n\nsolid solution. In Ca5Nb2TiO12 and related compounds the variation of TC?r with sintering \n\ntemperature was observed by Bendershy et al. [4]. The explanation for the variation of \n\nTC?r is associated with the disordering of the crystal, which was studied by HRTEM. \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\n7.2 Microstructure Characterization of Ceramics \n\nFigure 7-1 presents the SEM micrographs of the sintered ceramics. BLT ceramics \n\nsintered between 1400 and 1600 \u00baC present quite dense microstructures and are \n\ncharacterised by anisotropic grains. The density of the ceramics increases until 1500 \u00baC \n\nand then decreases for the samples sintered at higher temperatures and it is related with the \n\npresence of porosity, which can be seen in the SEM micrographs (Figure 7-1); \n\ncorresponding density is given in Table 7-1. The grain anisotropy increases with the \n\nincrease of the sintering temperature as corroborated by the calculated aspect ratio of the \n\ngrains that varies from 3 to 24 with the sintering temperature. For the sintering \n\ntemperatures up to 1500\u00baC the longest grain dimension varies between 5 to 20 \u00b5m and it \n\nincreases drastically with the sintering temperature to 52\u00b5m. Concomitantly the density of \n\nthe sample decreases for the highest sintering temperatures because of this abnormal \n\nanisotropic grain growth which results in the entrapment of some pores inside the grains. \n\nThe anisotropic behaviour of BLT (1:1:4) ceramics was also observed by Fukami et al [7] \n\nand Reaney et al [5].  \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nTable 7-1: Physical parameters of BLT ceramic sintered at different temperatures.  \n\nSintering \n\nTemperature(\no\nC) \n\nRelative density \nMaximum Aspect \n\nratio of Grain \n\nMaximum Size of \n\nthe grain in longer \n\naxis (\u00b5m) \n\n1400\no\nC-6h 93% 3 5 \n\n1450\u00baC-6h 94% 5 6 \n\n1500\u00baC-6h 96% 10 15 -20 \n\n1550\u00baC-2h 95% 22 52 \n\n1600\u00baC-2h 95% 24 52 \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 7-2 presents the EDS spectra of BLT ceramics sintered at 1450\u00baC/6h that \n\nconfirms the ceramic composition and indicates that no extra phases are present. Chemical \n\nelemental mapping was performed on these ceramics and it was observed that some \n\nspecific grains are rich in Ba and Ti and deficient in La, as shown in Figure 7-3. To have a \n\nclear picture about this distribution back scattered electron spectroscopy was performed \n\nand in some regions a few grains have a slightly different light contrast (Figure 7-4), what \n\nseems to corroborate the observations of the elemental mapping. Due to the XRD detection \n\nlimits ( ~ 3% volume) this compositional variation was not observed by XRD and it was \n\nnot possible, with the available resources to identify the stoichiometry of this BLT phase. \n\nSimilar findings were reported by Okawa et al [6] for this composition.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n (a) \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n (b) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n (c) \n\n \n\n \n (d) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\n \n (e) \n\nFigure 7-1: SEM micrographs of BLT ceramics sintered at different temperatures a) 1400\u00baC/6h, b) \n\n1450\u00baC/6h c) 1500\u00baC/6h d) 1550\u00baC/2h e) 1600\u00baC/2h.  \n\n \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nkeV\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n cps/eV\n\n La  La  La  Ba \n Ba  Ba \n Ti  Ti \n\n O \n\n \nFigure 7-2: EDS spectra of BLT ceramics sintered at 1450\u00baC/6h. \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7-3: EDS mapping of BLT ceramics sintered at 1450\u00baC/6h  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 7-4: Back Scattered SEM micrograph of BLT ceramic at 1450\u00baC/6h (secondary phase encircle \n\nin red). \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nElectrical Characterization of BLT Ceramics  \n\nFigure 7-5 (a) and (b) represents the dielectric permittivity and losses as a function \n\nof frequency and temperature for BLT sintered ceramics.

The \n\nreason of high relative permittivity may be related with the size of the grains and their \n\ndistribution. For ceramics sintered at 1500\u00ba C the grain sizes varies from 2 to 20\u00b5m in the \n\nlongest axis of grain and has higher density compared to ceramics sintered at higher and \n\nlower temperatures.  \n\n \n\n The losses were measured at 1 MHz and varied between 0.009 and 0.001. The \n\ncomparison with the literature reports is difficult since the reported values correspond to \n\nthe MW range. \n\n \n\n The permittivity of the BLT ceramics varies almost linearly with temperature as \n\nshown in Figure 7-5(b), which is good from the application point of view.  \n\n \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n10000 100000 1000000\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nRelative permittivity\n\n 1600\no\nC-2h\n\n 1550\no\nC-2h\n\n 1500\no\nC-6h\n\n 1450\no\nC-6h\n\n 1400\no\nC-6h\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne\n\n p\ne\n\nrm\nit\n\nti\nv\n\nit\ny\n\nFrequency(Hz)\n\nLoss tangent\n\n 1600\no\nC-2h\n\n 1550\no\nC-2h\n\n 1500\no\nC-6h\n\n 1450\no\nC-6h\n\n 1400\no\nC-6h\n\n L\no\ns\ns\n  \n\nta\nn\ng\ne\nn\nt\n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n\n40 60 80 100 120 140\n\n42\n\n44\n\n46\n\n48\n\n50\n\n52\n\n54\n\n56\n\n58\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne\n\n p\ne\n\nr\nm\n\nit\nti\n\nv\nit\n\ny\n\nTemperature(\no\nC)\n\n 1600\no\nC-2h\n\n 1550\no\nC-2h\n\n 1500\no\nC-6h\n\n 1450\no\nC-6h\n\n 1400\no\nC-6h\n\n \n\n \n\n \n(b) \n\n \nFigure 7-5: Dielectric properties of sintered BLT ceramics: a) relative permittivity and losses as a \n\nfunction of frequency and b) relative permittivity as a function of temperature. \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe observed behaviour of the temperature coefficient of the relative permittivity \n\n(TC?r) as a function of processing temperature is highly unusual and according to the \n\nauthors knowledge was not reported in the literature until now. There is a double-crossing \n\nof zero TC?r with the processing temperature as depicted in Figure 7-6. The temperature \n\ndependence of the relative permittivity (TC?r) changes from a positive (TC?r of \n\n15.3ppm/\u00baC for the sample sintered at 1400\u00baC) to a negative value (TC?r about -38ppm/\u00baC \n\nfor the sample sintered at 1500\u00baC) and again changes to a positive one with the increase of \n\nthe sintering temperature. \n\n \n\nA similar observation was reported by Cava et al. [4] for the system Ca5Nd2TiO12 \n\n(Figure7-7). The reason for the variation of TC?r was suggested to be related with the \n\nordering of cations in the B sites which was studied by HTEM. Cava found that the degree \n\nof B sites cation ordering is higher in ceramics sintered at intermediate temperatures as \n\nwhen compared with ceramics sintered at low and high temperature where TC?r have high \n\npositive values. \n\n \n\nIt is worth to mention, that this finding might be very useful for the tailoring the \n\nTC?r to near zero of BLT ceramics. However further studies of the microstructure and \n\ncrystallographic nature of BLT ceramics, that are out of the aim of this thesis, are needed \n\nto understand these observations.  \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n1400 1450 1500 1550 1600\n\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n Temp.

With the increase of the sintering temperature there is a decrease in the porosity (Figure \n\n7-8), an increase in the dielectric permittivity and the losses approached to zero. The \n\nmaximum permittivity of about 57.5 was achieved for films sintered at 1600\u00baC/1h and with \n\nloss tangent lower than 0.002 at 1 MHz frequency. The permittivity doesn\u2019t vary much \n\nwith increasing temperature from 30 to 100\u00baC (Figure 7-11(b)), that is an essential \n\ncharacteristic in microwave applications in terms of frequency selectivity.

This behaviour might be related with details of the microstructure or \n\nmodifications of the degree of ordering as suggested by [4]. Indeed, it was reported that \n\nTC?r of BNT thick films approaches to zero with the increase of the sintering temperature \n\nor aspect ratio of the film [11]. \n\n \n\nThe dielectric permittivity and loss tangent of different thick BLT films and \n\nceramics sintered at 1450\u00baC for 6h represented in Figure 7-12 as a function of frequency. It \n\ncan be seen that, with the increase of the film thickness, from 13 to 30 \u00b5m the dielectric \n\nproperties approach to wards those of the ceramics. In fact, in thick films the contribution \n\nof the film bulk to the dielectric response is higher than in a thin film, diluting the \n\ncontribution of any interfacial layer between the film and the substrate, usually deleterious \n\nto the film dielectric response. On the other hand, as the bulk thickness of the film \n\nincreases the effect of the constrained sintering becomes diluted as well, and the grain \n\ngrowth and grain orientation in this case becomes more similar to the bulk microstructure.  \n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nLoss Tangent\n\n 13\u00b5m film\n\n 30\u00b5m film\n\n 1.5\u00b5m cer.\n\nRelative Permittivity\n\n 13 \u00b5m film \n\n 30 \u00b5m film \n\n 1.5 mm cer.\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne\n\n p\ne\n\nr\nm\n\nit\nti\n\nv\nit\n\ny\n\nFrequency(Hz)\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n L\no\n\ns\ns\n\n t\na\n\nn\ng\n\ne\nn\n\nt\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7-12: Relative permittivity and losses as a function of frequency for 13\u00b5m, 30\u00b5m thick BLT \n\nfilms and 1.5 mm thick ceramic. \n\n \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\n7.4 BLT Films and Ceramics Comparison  \n\nTable 7-3 summarises the properties of BLT films and ceramics prepared under the \n\ncurrent work. In general the dielectric response of BLT films doesn\u2019t differ too much from \n\nthe ones of BLT ceramics, in terms of dielectric permittivity and dielectric losses. However \n\nthe main differences reside in the temperature coefficient of the dielectric permittivity.  \n\n \n\nAt low sintering temperature the permittivity of ceramics is higher than the \n\nequivalent films what might be due to the high degree of porosity of the films. On the other \n\nhand films sintered at 1550 and 1600\u00baC present higher dielectric permittivity what might \n\nbe related with the anisotropy of the microstructure and with the change in grain size.  \n\n \n\nReaney et al. [5] reported the dependence of the electrical response on the \n\nanisotropy of the microstructure of BLT ceramics. The dielectric permittivity is higher by \n\n20 % when measured in perpendicular direction of pressing than in parallel direction of \n\npressing. Similar findings were observed for BNT films with needle shape like \n\nmorphology by Fu Zhi et al. [8] and attributed to the constrained sintering which promotes \n\nto elongated growth of the grains. Similar behaviour in terms of dielectric response and \n\nmicrostructure was also observed for other compounds such as Bi4Ti3O12 [9], PbBi4Ti4O15 \n\nand Pb2Bi4Ti5O18 [10].  \n\n \n\nConcerning TC?r the variation between films and ceramics and its dependence on \n\nthe sintering temperature is appreciable. As well reported in the literature TC?r depends on \n\nmany aspects, namely on tolerance factor [3], ordering of B sites cations with change in the \n\nsintering temperature [4] and aspect ratio of the grain size [11] what might affect in a \n\nsimilar way the TC?r of thick films. However, for the case of films, on top of that one \n\nneeds to consider the changes induced by the constrained sintering, either the residual \n\nporosity or the altered degree of the microstructure anisotropy when compared with \n\nequivalent ceramics. The analysis of the variation of TC?r in films becomes more difficult \n\nand in order to distinguish between the possible contributions to this variation systematic \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\nstudies are necessary, that were out of the objective of this master thesis and are currently \n\nunder investigation.  \n\n \n\nNoteworthy here, is the observation that the variation of TC?r in films is very \n\ndependent on the processing conditions and the full understand of this variation in order to \n\ntailor the final properties of the films is essential for the complete exploitation of the \n\npossible commercial applications for thick films of MW materials.  \n\n \nTable 7-3: Dielectric characteristics of BLT films and ceramics.  \n\nSintering \n\nTemperature \n\n(\u00baC) \n\nPermittivity \n\nat 1MHz \n\n(Ceramics) \n\nPermittivity \n\nat 1MHz \n\n(Films) \n\nLoss tangent \n\nat 1MHz \n\n(Ceramics) \n\nLoss tangent \n\nat 1MHz \n\n(Films) \n\nTC?r \n\n(30-100)\u00baC \n\n(Ceramics) \n\n(ppm/\u00baC) \n\nTC?r \n\n(30-100)\u00baC \n\n(Films) \n\n(ppm/\u00baC) \n\n \n\n1450 44 42 0.001 0.009 +4 +103 \n\n1500 51 47 0.002 0.003 -17 +58 \n\n1550 48 53 0.002 0.002 +44 +58 \n\n1600 46 58 0.001 0.002 +62 +30 \n\n \n\n7.5 Conclusion \n\n BLT thick films and ceramics possess typical microstructures in which anisotropic \n\ngrain growth took place with the increasing sintering temperature. In general BLT thick \n\nfilms are less dense than equivalent ceramics. \n\n \n\nThe dielectric permittivity, dielectric losses and temperature coefficient of the \n\npermittivity of 10\u00b5m thick BLT films sintered at 1600\u00baC are 58, 0.002 and +30ppm/\u00baC at \n\n1MHz, respectively. A maximum relative permittivity of 51, loss tangent of 0.002 and \n\nTC?r of -17ppm/\u00baC at 1MHz were obtained for BLT ceramics sintered at 1500\u00baC. \n\n \n\nIn comparison with BLT ceramics the dielectric response is quite similar in terms \n\nof dielectric permittivity and dielectric losses, being the small differences attributed to the \n\ndensity and to the constrained sintering that takes place in thick films. With the increase of \n\nthickness the dielectric behaviour of BLT films approach to the one of equivalent ceramics. \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\nHowever, appreciable differences were observed in terms of TC?r and its dependence on \n\nthe sintering temperature. TC?r of BLT films sintered between 1450\u00baC and 1600\u00baC \n\ndecrease from 103ppm/\u00baC to 30ppm/\u00baC, while for the case of ceramics it first decreases \n\nwith the sintering temperature and then increases. These results are particularly relevant \n\nbecause they clearly show the dependence of TC?r on the processing parameters and the \n\ndifferences between bulk ceramics and thick films. The effect of the processing on TC?r \n\nvariation is complex and many variables seem to play a role, including the anisotropy \n\ngrowth of the grains and ionic disorder. Because of that the reasons behind this difference \n\nare not clear at the moment. This understanding is fundamental and will open opportunities \n\nto developed materials with tailored responses. \n\n7.6 References \n\n[1] Takashi Okawa, Katsumas Kiucchi, Hiraoki Okoki Okabe and Hitoshi Ohsato, \n\nFerroelectrics, 2002, Vol 272, 345-250.  \n\n[2] E Colla, I M.

The composite thick films are characterized by \n\nSEM and EDS to study the uniformity of the deposition and composition respectively. \n\nDielectric response is assessed at 1 MHz.  \n\n \n\n8.1 Introduction \n\nAs mentioned before, there is a gap in terms of dielectrics between high \n\npermittivity (low Qf) and low permittivity (high Qf) materials suitable for specific \n\nmicrowave applications (Figure 3-1). Currently no commercial material with near zero ?f, \n\nhigh Qf and permittivity between 45-80 is available [1]. \n\n \n\nOne of the approaches that is being considered to tailor the dielectric response of \n\nMW ceramics and namely to obtain tf near zero is to conjugate in the same material end \n\nmembers compositions with opposite sign of tf. Ceramic composites of near zero tf have \n\nbeen prepared in the systems of CaTiO3-NdAlO3 and ZrTiO4-ZnNd2O6 by solid state \n\nreaction [2-3]. Zheng et al. [1] successfully prepared composites of BaLa4Ti4O15 and \n\nBa4Nd9.33Ti18O54 by solid state reaction and reported tf ~ -20ppm/\u00baC, Qf 10,000GHz and \n\npermittivity of ~ 61, for the xBNT-(1-x)BLT (0?x?0.75) composite. To achieve high \n\ndensity and to decrease the processing costs of this composite materials the same group \n\nused a glass composition (B2O3-Bi2O3-ZnO-SiO2 (BBZS) as a sintering aid and \n\nsuccessfully decrease the sintering temperature by 350\u00baC from 1500\u00baC [4]. \n\n \n\nAs a bulk material the most stringent properties needed to be used as MW resonator \n\nand filters, are Qf >40,000 GHz and tf near zero. For antenna core technology, the less \n\nstringent requirement for Qf and tf due to metallisation dominates the dielectric loss \n\nbroadening the resonant frequency. The vast array of different antenna frequencies requires \n\nmaterials with 20<?r&lt;80. In addition, the use of such materials in handsets will ultimately \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nnecessitate low cost raw materials and low processing costs as production volumes \n\nincreases and profit margin reduces.  \n\n \n\nAs per author\u00b4s knowledge no work has been reported about the fabrication of thick \n\ncomposite film for functional electroceramics by electrophoretic deposition technique so, \n\nthe attempt was made to fabricate functional electoceramic composite thick film of BNT-\n\nBLT with EPD. However, this technique has been used to prepare nano composites, \n\npolymer-polymer composite and glass/polymer composites for other applications like \n\nmechanical, medical, inter alia [5-6]. \n\n \n\nBy keeping this in view, attempts to fabricate composite thick films of BNT/BLT \n\nand BLT/BNT by EPD were undertaken in this work, to prove the concept that EPD is a \n\nviable, low cost and versatile technique to design and engineer thick composite films for \n\nminiaturised dielectric MW / High frequency applications. \n\n \n\n8.2 Experimental \n\n \n\nBLT-BNT composite films were fabricated in acetone based suspension with \n\ntriethanolamine and the details of fabrication are given in Chapter 4.  \n\n \n\nIn BNT/BLT composite the first layer of BNT was carried out at 60V for 30 \n\nsecond, followed by the layer of BLT carried out at 100V for 60 second. In a similar way \n\nBLT/BNT composite thick films were fabricated by carried out each layer of BNT and \n\nBLT at 60V for 30 second.  \n\n \n\nThe deposition behaviour for individual BNT and BLT films with time and \n\nconstant voltage was depicted in Chapter 6, also illustrated in Figure 8-1 for convenience; \n\nthe deposited thickness corresponds to the green film. \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\n20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nT\nh\n\nic\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n(\u00b5\n\nm\n)\n\nTime(sec.)\n\n Voltage= 60V\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nT\nh\n\nic\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n (\n\n\u00b5\nm\n\n)\n\nTime(sec)\n\n Voltage=60V\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) \n\nFigure 8-1: Deposited thickness versus time in acetone based suspension with triethanolamine for a) \n\nBLT b) BNT. \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\n8.3 Microstructure of BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT Composite Thick Films \n\nTo examine the layered structure of BNT-BLT composite thick films cross sections \n\nwere prepared. The preparation of cross section was a complicated task due to the flexible \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\nnature of the used substrate and required precise chemical etching reagents for good grain \n\nboundary contrast. \n\n \n\nFigure 8-2(b) depicts the cross-section microstructure of BNT/BLT composite \n\nfilms with a total thickness of 30\u00b5m sintered at 1500\u00baC/6h. As clearly seen from the \n\nimages composite film is quite dense and very homogeneous, with no abrupt interface \n\nbetween the two layers and the substrate, since no gaps are visible. Top view of the film \n\nshows the platelet like shape of BLT with very good densification (Figure 8-2(a)). EDS \n\nanalysis was performed on the composite thick films to check the chemical homogeneity of \n\nthe composite and the results are presented in Figure 8-3.  \n\n \n\nAccording to the deposition parameters for BNT and BLT, the BNT layer deposited \n\nat 60V for 30 second should have the thickness of 17\u00b5m and the top layer of BLT \n\ndeposited at 100V for 60 second should be near to 46 \u00b5m so, the total thickness of green \n\ncomposite film should be approximately 63\u00b5m. If one deduces around 16% of shrinkage \n\nduring the sintering, then the film should be near 50 \u00b5m, but the total thickness obtained in \n\nBNT/BLT composite thick film is 30\u00b5m after sintered.  \n\n \n\nIn the previous studies, it was observed that the thickness does not increase linearly \n\nthrough out the deposition thickness because of the decrease in electric field with time. \n\nThis could be the case for BNT/BLT composite thick film in which the second deposition \n\nshould be performed for longer time and at high voltage, when compared with the \n\ndeposition of individual layers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\n   \n                       (a)                                       (b)   \nFigure 8-2: SEM micrographs of BNT/BLT thick film composite sintered at 1500\u00baC/6h a) top view of \n\nfilm b) cross section view. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8-3: EDS of BNT/BLT thick film composite. \n\n \n\nFigure 8-4(b) depicts the cross-section microstructure of BLT/BNT composite \n\nfilms with a total thickness of 24\u00b5m sintered at 1500\u00baC/1h. The cross section image reflect \n\nthat composite film is dense and very homogeneous, with no abrupt interface between the \n\ntwo layers and the substrate, since no gaps are visible. It is difficult to distinguish the BLT \n\nand BNT layer as no visual contrast can be seen between the layers. In the top view of the \n\nSEM image one can see the presence of BNT rod like grains with some amount of porosity \n\n(Figure 8-4 (a)) and EDS spectra (Figure 8-5) confirm the presence of all the elements of \n\nBLT and BNT excluding any possibility of secondary element in the composite thick film.  \n\nBLT \n\nBNT \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\nAccording to the deposition parameter depicted in Figure 8-1, the first layer of BLT \n\nshould be 15\u00b5m thick, deposited at 60V for 30 second, followed by the second layer of \n\nBNT 17\u00b5m thick, carried out at 60V for 30 second. So, the predicted thickness for the \n\ngreen film according to the deposition parameter should be 32 \u00b5m and if one deduces the \n\nshrinkage by 16% one will get the value of thickness for sintered film of 26 \u00b5m which is \n\nquite close to what it was achieved for this BLT/BNT composite layer structure (24 \u00b5m). \n\n \n\n \n(a) (b)  \n\nFigure 8-4: SEM micrographs of BLT/BNT thick film composite sintered at 1500\u00baC/1h a) top view of \n\nfilm b) cross section view. \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nkeV\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n cps/eV\n\n La  La  La  Nd  Nd \n\n Nd \n\n Ti  Ti \n Ba \n\n Ba  Ba \n O \n\n \nFigure 8-5: EDS spectra of BLT/BNT thick film composite. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\n 8.4 Electrical Properties of BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT Composite Thick Films \n\n  The measurements were performed at different points of the films and the \n\nrepresented results correspond to maximum and minimum values obtained in these films. \n\nFigure 8-6(a) depicts the relative permittivity and losses plotted as a function of the \n\nfrequency and temperature for BNT/BLT composite films.

In the process used in this work for the \n\nfabrication of composites, the first layer acts as an barrier for the second layer which \n\naffects the deposition of the second layer and the overall thickness of the composite film. \n\nFurther studies on the composite deposition parameters are needed in order to optimise for \n\nexample the thickness control. \n\n \n\nIt is shown that the gap in terms of materials with 45<?r<80 can be filled with \n\ncomposite thick films of BNT-BLT fabricated by EPD. The properties obtained for these \n\ncomposite thick films are ?r ~60-70, TC?r ~-16ppm/\u00baC and loss tan(?) ~0.002 which are \n\nquite close to the composite ceramics reported before [1]. This constitutes an important \n\nresult since together with the ability to decrease the size, contributing to the miniaturization \n\nof the device size, composite thick layered structures can be used to tailor the materials \n\nproperties. \n\n \n\nTo further improve the composite properties an optimum control on the deposition \n\nparameters or the use of intermediate drying and pressing steps or the use of additives and \n\nmodifiers should be exploited. Moreover to assure low fabrication costs ways to reduce the \n\nComposite \n\nSystem/Sintering \n\nTemperature \n\nTime of \n\ndeposition of \n\nlayer \n\nThickness of \n\nfilm ( \u00b5m) \n\n \n\nPermittivi\n\nty(1MHz) \n\nLoss \n\nTangent \n\n(?) \n\nTemperature \n\nCoefficient \n\nwith \n\nPermittivity   \n\n(ppm/\u00baC) \n\nBNT/BLT \n\n1500\u00baC-6h \n\n60V-30 sec. \n\n100V-60sec. \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n~71 0.002 -16 \n\nBLT/BNT \n\n1500\u00baC-1h \n\n60V-30 sec. \n\n60V-30sec. \n24 ~63 0.005 +113 \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\nsintering temperature of the composite without affecting the electrical properties are also \n\nrequired for the composite films under study.  \n\n8.6 References \n\n[1] Hong Zheng, I M Reaney, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Vol. 44. no.5A,  \n\n2005, pp3087- 3090, 2005. \n\n[2] H Zheng, G D C Csete de Gyo\u00a8rgyfalva, R Quimby, H Bagshaw, R Ubic, I M Reaney \n\nand J.

Future Work \n\n \n\nThis work was performed in a systematic way and it was proved that the \n\nElectrophoretic deposition technique is an adequate technique for the fabrication of BLT \n\nfilms and BLT-BNT composites thick films on metallic substrates. However it is still \n\nnecessary to continue these studies in order to optimize some parameters related with the \n\ndeposition of composite thick films and some scientific questions need to be answered as \n\nwell. Below is a list, that does not intend to be exhaustive, but indicates some of the most \n\nrelevant aspects that need further studies. \n\n \n\n1. Further studies are needed to optimise the deposition conditions for BNT-BLT and \n\nBLT \u2013 BNT composites, namely the exact control of the layer thickness, to increase \n\nthe number of the multilayer\u2019s, among others. \n\n \n\n2.  To make thick dielectric films of practical use, it is necessary to reduce the \n\nsintering temperature in order to be make these films compatible with low cost \n\nmetallic or non metallic substrates; low sintering temperature attempts are then \n\nrequired, that may include the study of different sintering aids. \n\n \n\n3. The role of triethanolamine in the acetone based suspension needs to be exploited \n\nand clarified.  \n\n \n\n4. The dependence of TC?r of BLT thick films on the film processing conditions and \n\nmicrostructure requires systematic studies of constrained sintering of thick films on \n\nmetallic foils."}]}}}
