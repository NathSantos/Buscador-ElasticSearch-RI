INTRODUCTION\nSeveral authors have tried to use mineral diffusion mechanisms in order to determine cooling\n\nrates (e.g.: Spear &amp; Parrish, 1996 and references therein). These authors assumed that diffusion\ninduced by compositional variation in the garnet-biotite interface is a function of Kd(Mg/Fe)Garnet-\nBiotite in response to thermal changes, such as cooling during retrogression. During cooling garnet\nis enriched in Fe/(Fe+Mg), whereas biotite inclusions become poorer. When temperature drops\n\n\n\ne - T e r r a  Volume 16 \u2013 n\u00ba 8 |  2010\nVIII Congresso Nacional de Geologia\n\n2(4)\n\nbelow closure temperature, diffusion becomes negligible. The diffusive process is limited by the\nrate of diffusion in garnet, because DFe/MgBiotite >> DFe/MgGarnet and mass balance determines that\nthe rate of cation transfer between garnet and biotite must be the same. Therefore, Fe/(Fe+Mg)\nvariations will be a function of biotite inclusion size and Fe/(Fe+Mg) results in garnet and biotite\ninclusions can be transformed in their respective apparent closure temperatures, providing\ncooling rate patterns. This work explores the assumptions that allow petrological cooling rates to\nbe applied to natural systems, as well as the potential pitfalls regarding this methodology,\nnamely the difficulty in assuring that open-system behaviour did not take place in complex\norogenic belts, such as the Ribeira Belt. It also provides a new interpretation for complex cooling\npatterns and a possible solution to this problem.\n\n2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS\nThe studied S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua (SFSAP) sector is located in the central-\n\nnorth Ribeira Belt (RB), SE Brazil. The RB is a 1500 km long NE-SW to NNE-SSW trending\nNeoproterozoic belt formed during the Braziliano Orogeny as outcome of the collision between\nthe S\u00e3o Francisco and West Congo cratons, from which resulted Western Gondwana (Cordani et\nal., 1973). RB is a complex orogenic belt composed of several geological units, separated by\ndeep dextral shears. The SFSAP sector is located SE to one of these mega-shears, the Al\u00e9m\nPara\u00edba \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua shear (APPS) that vigorously deformed the area rocks\nimposing a NE-SW trending transpressive shear deformation associated with HT/LP\nmetamorphism (Bento dos Santos et al., 2007; 2008). Intense granulite facies metamorphism\nproduced generalized migmatization by partial melting of paragneisses. Outcrops in the area\ncomprise: a) migmatites; b) massive charnockites (granulites); and c) blastomylonites that\nresulted from shearing and retrogression of the other rock types.\n\n3. PETROLOGICAL COOLING RATES RESULTS\nThe Spear &amp; Parrish (1996) method is based on Fe-Mg exchange modelling between a garnet\n\nmegablast and corresponding biotite inclusions. Fe/(Fe+Mg) variations will be a function of\nbiotite inclusions size if diffusion is exclusive between garnet and the several biotites included.\nThis will produce larger compositional variations in smaller biotite inclusions. Therefore,\nFe/(Fe+Mg) in each inclusion can be transformed in its respective apparent closure temperature\nusing the garnet\u2019s core composition, the diffusion coefficients of Chakraborty &amp; Gangully\n(1992) and the Ferry &amp; Spear (1978) thermometer.\n\nFig. 1 shows two contrasting correlations between biotite inclusions size and Fe/Mg (i.e.\napparent closure temperature): some samples show high Fe/Mg variation and significant\ntemperature dispersion (Fig. 1a-b) with cooling rates spanning from 0.1 to 200\u00baC/Ma, whereas\nothers show very narrow Fe/Mg variation that provide flat closure temperature patterns (Fig. 1c-\nd) with cooling rates spanning from 1 to 200\u00baC/Ma. The latter, although providing correlation\ntrends between Fe/Mg results and biotite inclusions size, have a maximum Fe/Mg range &lt;0.2.\nThis is problematic, since small amplitudes in Fe/Mg of biotite inclusions provide a very narrow\nclosure temperature range (&lt;50\u00baC). This implies that Fe-Mg diffusion between garnet and\nrespective biotite inclusions was insufficient to display cooling rate patterns.\n\nHowever, using the garnets and biotites that show sufficient Fe/Mg variation (e.g.: Fig. 1a-b),\nand, consequently, high dispersion of closure temperatures, it is possible to observe that there is\na significant difference between migmatites and granulites regarding cooling rate patterns (Fig.\n2). This is emphasized after using software that removes result dispersion (Fig. 2b).\n\nDefinitive cooling rates results for charnockites and migmatites are presented in Fig. 2b.\nMigmatites show high cooling rates at high T (6\u00baC/Ma) and low cooling rates at low T\n(0.1\u00baC/Ma), displaying a decrease in cooling rates with time, whereas charnockites underwent\nlow cooling rates at high T (2\u00baC/Ma) and high cooling rates at low T (120\u00baC/Ma).\n\n\n\ne - T e r r a  Volume 16 \u2013 n\u00ba 8 |  2010\nVIII Congresso Nacional de Geologia\n\n3(4)\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Petrological cooling rates using the Spear &amp; Parrish (1996) method.

Fig. 2b shows the effect of applying software\nthat removes dispersion from the results, revealing the cooling trends for charnockites and migmatites.\n\n4. DISCUSSION\nThe results obtained with the Spear &amp; Parrish (1996) method are difficult to interpret both for\n\ngranulites and migmatites, because biotite dimension (logarithmic) vs. garnet \u2013 biotite apparent\nclosure temperatures show a very low range of apparent closure temperatures for biotites that are\nvery different in terms of size. This suggests that garnet and respective biotite inclusions must\nhave been reequilibrated (re-homogenized) at high temperatures and then cooled very fast,\ninhibiting significant change in the Fe/Mg of biotite inclusions, and consequently, in the apparent\nclosure temperatures. In other cases, a high dispersion of closure temperatures is observable.\nThis implies that cationic exchange with mass balance preservation between garnet and biotite\ninclusions (i.e. close system behaviour) was not exclusive. Intense deformation caused by long-\nterm sub-horizontal transpressive shearing in central RB (Fonseca et al., 2008; Bento dos Santos\net al., 2009) can be seen in sheared migmatites and granulites (as previously described). This is\nthe probable cause for the open-system behaviour found in some samples. It may have altered\nbiotite diffusion mechanisms and reequilibrated garnet with minerals or fluids outside the garnet\n\n\n\ne - T e r r a  Volume 16 \u2013 n\u00ba 8 |  2010\nVIII Congresso Nacional de Geologia\n\n4(4)\n\n\u2013 biotite inclusion system, adding complexities and increasing the uncertainties regarding the use\nof this methodology.\n\nThe use of garnets and biotites that present large Fe/Mg variation (high dispersion of closure\ntemperatures) and software that removes the dispersion of the results (Fig. 2), show that\nmigmatites cooled faster than charnockites at high temperatures, being removed from high T\nsooner. Later, charnockites were cooled much faster (120\u00baC/Ma) during the last stages of\nretrogression.\n\nBento dos Santos et al. (2008) provided thermochronological constraints for the SFSAP sector\nbased on integration of multiple isotopic systems. They concluded that migmatites were cooled\nat relatively stable 3 \u2013 5\u00baC/Ma, whereas granulites were maintained at lower crustal levels with a\nvery slow cooling rate (&lt;2\u00baC/Ma) during long-term sub-horizontal transpressive shearing\n(Fonseca et al., 2008). This period of slow-cooling endured until orogenic collapse occurred,\nleading to abrupt fast cooling of charnockites (8 to 30\u00baC/Ma) in the last stages of Brasiliano\nOrogeny. The obtained petrological cooling rates are difficult to interpret, but provide qualitative\nand quantitative results in agreement with Bento dos Santos et al. (2008) conclusions, such as the\nidea of high temperature maintenance that reequilibrated the garnets, followed by very fast\ncooling that did not allow significant Fe/Mg diffusion between garnet and biotite inclusions.\n\nTherefore, although with some important difficulties, garnet \u2013 biotite diffusion mechanisms\ncan be used to obtain reliable petrological cooling rates.\n\nAcknowledgements\nFAPESP, POCA-PETROLOG (CEGUL, UI: 263; POCTI/FEDER), GEODYN (POCTI \u2013 ISFL \u2013 5 \u2013 32)\nand a PhD scholarship from FCT (SFRH/BD/17014/2004) co-financed by FEDER provided support for\nfield and analytical work.
