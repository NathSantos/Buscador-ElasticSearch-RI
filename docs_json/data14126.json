Master\u2019s Dissertation \u2014 Faculty of \n\nLaw, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, 2016.   \n\n \n\nState immunity has undergone major changes over time and is still a highly controversial \n\nand hotly debated topic. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between human \n\nrights and the norms governing state immunity. Located in different geological strata of \n\ninternational law, the clashes between the law of state immunity and human rights drew \n\nattention to the struggle among competing conceptions of international law. On one hand, \n\nbeing commonly linked to the principle of sovereign equality and to the need for stability \n\nin international relations, state immunity operates when a domestic court cannot exercise \n\njurisdiction over the subject matter of a dispute because one of the parties is a foreign state. \n\nOn the other, human rights have a different logic and require change and the realization of \n\njustice. The development of the body of human rights law allowed to call into question the \n\ngrant of state immunity in cases in which human rights norms were violated. Legal \n\nquestions arising from the relationship between state immunity and human rights have \n\nbeen put before domestic and international courts. Having examined the various judgments \n\ndealing with these issues, this study contends that the answers to the technical and \n\ndogmatic questions originating from the encounter between state immunity and human \n\nrights reproduce theoretical conflicts which happen\u2014to use Koskenniemi\u2019s expression\u2014at \n\na \u2018higher level of abstraction\u2019. The ICJ\u2019s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State \n\nmay have crystallized a consensus according to which state immunity trumps the \n\nindividual\u2019s right to reparation for serious violations of human rights. This consensus, \n\nhowever, is contingent and can be questioned through the language of international law.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: state immunity; human rights; international legal argumentation; international \n\nlegal theory.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nRESUMO \n \n\n \n\nBON\u00c1CUL RODRIGUES, Guilherme. Imunidade Estatal e Direitos Humanos Perante \n\nCortes Nacionais e Internacionais. 2016. 239 f. Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o (Mestrado) \u2014 Faculdade de \n\nDireito, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, 2016.  \n\n \n\nA imunidade estatal passou por grandes mudan\u00e7as atrav\u00e9s dos tempos e ainda \u00e9 um tema \n\ncontroverso e bastante debatido. A proposta deste estudo foi investigar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre os \n\ndireitos humanos e as normas que governam a imunidade estatal. Estando em camadas \n\ngeol\u00f3gicas diferentes do direito internacional, os choques entre o direito da imunidade \n\nestatal e os direitos humanos chamaram aten\u00e7\u00e3o para a disputa entre concep\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nconflitantes de direito internacional. De um lado, sendo comumente relacionada ao \n\nprinc\u00edpio da igualdade soberana e \u00e0 necessidade de estabilidade nas rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ninternacionais, a imunidade estatal opera quando uma corte n\u00e3o pode exercer jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsobre o objeto de uma disputa em raz\u00e3o de uma das partes ser um estado estrangeiro. De \n\noutro, os direitos humanos t\u00eam uma l\u00f3gica diferente e requerem mudan\u00e7a e a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\njusti\u00e7a. O desenvolvimento do corpo dos direitos humanos permitiu questionar a concess\u00e3o \n\nde imunidade estatal em casos em que normas de direitos humanos foram violadas. \n\nQuest\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas originadas do relacionamento entre imunidade estatal e direitos \n\nhumanos foram levadas a v\u00e1rias cortes dom\u00e9sticas e internacionais. Tendo sido realizado o \n\nexame dos v\u00e1rios casos lidando com esse assunto, este estudo argumenta que as respostas \n\npara as quest\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas e dogm\u00e1ticas originadas do encontro entre imunidade de \n\njurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o e direitos humanos reproduzem conflitos te\u00f3ricos que ocorrem\u2014na express\u00e3o de \n\nKoskenniemi\u2014em um \u2018n\u00edvel mais elevado de abstra\u00e7\u00e3o.\u2019 O julgamento da Corte \n\nInternacional de Justi\u00e7a em Imunidades de Jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o do Estado pode ter cristalizado um \n\nconsenso segundo o qual as normas que se relacionam com a imunidade estatal prevalecem \n\nsobre o direito individual de repara\u00e7\u00e3o por s\u00e9rias viola\u00e7\u00f5es de direitos humanos. Tal \n\nconsenso, no entanto, \u00e9 contingente e pode ser questionado por meio da linguagem do \n\ndireito internacional. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: imunidade estatal; direitos humanos;

[Q]uite apart from the elucidation of the applicable rules of State immunity, the \n\ndoctrine provides a valuable case study of the present nature of the international \n\ncommunity \u2026 A study of State immunity directs attention to the central issues of the \n\ninternational legal system.\u2019 \n\n \n\nHazel Fox and Philippa Webb, The Law of State Immunity (3rd edn, OUP 2013) 7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1 Proposal: a case study in international legal argumentation focusing on the \n\nrelationship between state immunity and human rights  \n\n  \n\nThe initial intuition that inspired this research was that the study of the discourses \n\non the relationship between, on one side, state immunity, and, on the other, human rights \n\nand jus cogens could deepen the understanding of how international legal argumentation \n\nworks. The encounter of these very different branches of international law sheds light on a \n\ntension that does not relate solely to the normative conflicts with which international law \n\ntheorists and practitioners are very familiar, but also to the foundational discourses of the \n\ndiscipline. \n\nState immunity is, of course, traditionally deemed a consequence of the principle of \n\nsovereign equality and an expression of the maxim par in parem non habet imperium and \n\nvariations thereof.1 Its aims are usually considered to be the promotion of stability, of \n\n                                                \n1 Malcolm Shaw, International Law (6th edn, CUP 2011) 697-701 and 715-718; Martin Dixon, Textbook on \nInternational Law (6th edn, OUP 2007) 174-178 and 184-185. \n\n\n\n2  \n\ncomity and of good relations between states.2 On the other hand, human rights and jus \n\ncogens operate with a different logic, by according priority to the realization of justice.3 \n\nWhen one may trump the operation of the other, choices have to be made. Technical legal \n\ndiscussions and dogmatics will often disguise these choices, which are related to the more \n\ncrucial issue of foundations. The answers to seemingly technical legal question are \n\ndependent on the conception one has of international law\u2014they hide theoretical conflicts \n\nabout what international law is and about how to find it out.4 In other words, these \n\nquestions do not have objectively ascertainable answers. These answers will have different \n\ndegrees of persuasiveness, which depend not only on their intrinsic characteristics, such as \n\ninternal coherence, but also on other factors, such as the biases and assumptions of the \n\naudience.5  \n\nThis study, therefore, does not presuppose there are correct answers to the various \n\nlegal questions arising from the relationship between state immunity and human rights.6 \n\nAccordingly, I will not try to point out allegedly correct solutions to these questions.  \n\nLegal dogmatics has a central role in the research I propose to undertake. Through \n\nan analysis of the various judicial decisions dealing with the relationship between state \n\nimmunity and human rights, I will try to identify the argumentative patterns, strategies and \n\napproaches of this legal debate. My aim is to recognize the theoretical conceptions of \n\ninternational law upon which these arguments and doctrines are founded. By doing it, I \n\nseek to demonstrate that the hegemonic outcome privileging state immunity over human \n\nrights can be questioned through the language of international law. As Koskenniemi \n\nargued, the theories that justify different interpretative constructions are external to the \n\nrules and to the facts themselves: there is not a theory which could ultimately solve \n                                                \n2 Shaw (n 1) 697-701 and 715-718; Dixon (n 1) 174-178 and 184-185. \n3 Alberto do Amaral J\u00fanior, Curso de Direito Internacional P\u00fablico (2nd edn, Atlas 2011) 657-658: \n \n\n\u2018O direito internacional de coexist\u00eancia compreendia, essencialmente, normas negativas, de \ncar\u00e1ter proibitivo, como a que veda a interven\u00e7\u00e3o em um Estado estrangeiro.

There are other types of immunities, such as the immunity ratione materiae of state \n\nofficials, the immunity ratione personae of heads of state, heads of government and \n\nforeign ministers, diplomatic and consular immunities, the immunities of international \n\norganizations and their officials etc. All these other immunities are governed by their own \n\nrules and principles and may also raise human rights issues. Nevertheless, for the purposes \n\nof this monograph, it was decided to focus on the immunity of the state itself.  \n\n \n\n1.2 Problem statement \n\n \n\nThe main questions underlying the research I propose to undertake are the \n\nfollowing:  \n\n \n\n1) What is the impact of human rights on the law of state immunity and how has this \n\nissue been dealt with dogmatically in domestic and international courts and in \n\nscholarly writings on the subject?  \n\n \n\n2) What do the different answers to the problems arising from the relationship between \n\nstate immunity and human rights reveal about the current competing theoretical \n\nconceptions of international law and about the practice of international legal \n\nargumentation?  \n\n \n\n1.3 Argument  \n\n \n\nWhen dealing with questions arising from the relationship between state immunity \n\nand human rights, domestic and international courts are faced with numerous questions. \n\nThey have to decide whether state immunity is enshrined in customary international law or \n\nis only an expression of comity. The basis of state immunity as a rule of law and the \n\n                                                \n7  Martti Koskennimi, \u2018Theory: Implications for the Practitioner\u2019 in P. Allott et al (eds), Theory and \nInternational Law: An Introduction (BIICL 1991) 44. \n8 David Kennedy, International Legal Structures (Nomos 1987) 294. \n\n\n\n4  \n\nprinciples governing it have to be ascertained. The legal nature of acts performed by states \n\nhas to be determined. Courts have to consider whether violations of international human \n\nrights law and international humanitarian law fit the dichotomy between acta jure imperii \n\nand acta jure gestionis or if it is the case that this distinction is immaterial in human rights \n\ncases. They have to decide whether an exception to state immunity in respect of torts \n\ncommitted in the forum state crystallized into a customary international rule. Courts will \n\nalso have to determine how the law of state immunity interacts with jus cogens norms. \n\nThey will have to investigate if the violation of a jus cogens norm may be interpreted as a \n\ntacit waiver of the right to immunity. Issues of normative hierarchy will also arise. The \n\nquestion of whether jus cogens norms take precedence over the rules relating to state \n\nimmunity will have to be answered. The problem of conflicting norms will also appear and \n\ncourts will have to determine whether the grant of state immunity can be considered a \n\nviolation of the individual\u2019s right of access to court. The list goes on.  \n\nThe answers to these problems depend on theoretical assumptions about the nature \n\nof international law. These theoretical assumptions incorporate choices, which will also \n\nlead to different attitudes towards the ascertainment of the law and towards the role of the \n\ninterpreter and of the institution in charge of applying the law. The answers provided are \n\ncontingent and remain open to contestation. Following the decision of the ICJ in \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State, it seems that the hegemonic view of the relationship \n\nbetween state immunity and human rights privileges the former to the detriment of the \n\nlatter. Nevertheless, this is an outcome open to contestation through the language of \n\ninternational law.9  \n\nAs emphasized by Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb in the quotation that is the \n\nepigraph of this chapter, state immunity is a subject of study that draws attention to the \n\nfundamental issues of international law.  \n\n \n\n                                                \n9 See Martti Koskenniemi, From Apology to Utopia: The Structure of International Legal Argument (CUP \n2005) 614-615 (footnotes omitted): \n \n\n\u2018If international law is indeterminate, then there is no limit to the extent it can be used to justify \n(and of course, to criticize) existing practices. If there is a structural bias, then international law \nis always already complicit in the actual system of distribution of material and spiritual values \nin the world. From this perspective, the task for lawyers would no longer be to seek to expand \nthe scope of the law so as to grasp the dangers of politics but to widen the opportunity of \npolitical contestation of an always already legalized world.  \n\u2018And yet, such contestation may also be carried out through the grammar of international law. \n\u2026\u2019 \n \n\n\n\n5  \n\n1.4 Structure of the monograph \n\n \n\nAfter these introductory notes, chapter 2 presents the main conceptual elements of \n\nthe law of state immunity and the framework in which issues arising from the relationship \n\nbetween state immunity and human rights are embedded. Chapter 3, which is the longest \n\nchapter of this monograph, deals with the judicial practice relating to state immunity and \n\nhuman rights. This chapter breaks down the main cases in which questions concerning \n\nstate immunity and human rights appear and maps the argumentative strategies employed \n\nby national and international courts and the theoretical conceptions upon which these \n\narguments are made. Chapter 4 is dedicated to proposals put forth by scholars to better \n\naccommodate state immunity and human rights. They are outlined and briefly assessed. \n\nChapter 5 expounds the core argument of this monograph, namely that the answers to the \n\nquestions arising from the relationship between state immunity and human rights hide \n\nconflicts among theoretical conceptions of international law, which happen at a\u2014to use \n\nKoskenniemi\u2019s expression\u2014\u2018higher level of abstraction\u2019 10 . As such, any consensus \n\nreached remains open to contestation through the language of international law. Some \n\ngeneral concluding thoughts are then offered. \n\n \n\n                                                \n10 See Koskenniemi (n 9) 3 (emphasis added):  \n \n\n\u2018In crucial doctrinal areas, treaties, customary law, general principles, jus cogens and so on \nconflicting views are constantly presented as \u201ccorrect\u201d normative outcomes. Each general \nprinciple seems capable of being opposed with an equally valid counter-principle. Moreover, \nthese conflicting views and principles are very familiar and attempts to overcome the conflicts \nthey entail seem to require returning to \u201ctheory\u201d which, however, merely reproduces the \nconflicts at a higher level of abstraction.\u2019 \n\n \n\n\n\n6  \n\n2 \u2014 CONCEPTS AND FRAMEWORK \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2018The origin of the absolute theory of state immunity is usually traced to the maxim par in \n\nparem non habet imperium. It has been convincingly shown that law-trained minds are \n\nacutely vulnerable to maxims, especially those in Latin.\u2019 \n\n \n\nGamal Moursi Badr, State Immunity: An Analytical and Prognostic View (Martinus \n\nNijhoff 1984) 94 (footnote omitted) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter presents the discourses and the framework which underlie the debate \n\non the relationship between state immunity and human rights. It starts by introducing the \n\nnotion of state immunity and the discussion surrounding whether the starting point of an \n\nanalysis of state immunity should be the principle of sovereign equality or the principle of \n\nadjudicatory jurisdiction.  \n\nSubsequently, alternative views about the basis of the law of state immunity are \n\nanalyzed. In an article published in 1911, Dionisio Anzilotti advanced a refreshing \n\nperspective on the subject. Although he is considered one of the proponents of absolute \n\nimmunity, Anzilotti dismissed the understanding according to which immunity is a \n\nmanifestation of the sovereign equality and the independence of states. Hersch \n\nLauterpacht, in an article published in 1951, boldly stated that there was no rule of law \n\nobliging states to grant immunity to other states and proposed the abolition of state \n\nimmunity subject to a few exceptions. James Crawford, upon considering that the assertion \n\npar in parem non habet jurisdictionem, traditionally understood to underlie state immunity, \n\nis question-begging, sought to rearticulate its basis. He found three international rules \n\nconsistent with the grant of state immunity (the international dispute settlement rule, the \n\n\n\n7  \n\ndomestic jurisdiction rule and the exhaustion of local remedies rule) and contended that the \n\ndistinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis did not exist as matter of \n\npositive international law. \n\nThe following section gives a brief panorama of the current law of state immunity. \n\nIt is analyzed how the restricted rule of state immunity came to be accepted. Studies \n\ncontesting the disseminated notion that absolute immunity existed as a rule of international \n\nlaw are also presented. Next, problems relating to the distinction between acta jure imperii \n\nand acta jure gestionis are discussed. A cursory overview of the sources of the law of state \n\nimmunity and a few remarks on the different issue of immunity from execution are then \n\noffered. \n\nFinally, referring to Wolfgang Friedmann\u2019s work about the changing structure of \n\ninternational law and Joseph Weiler\u2019s metaphor of the geology of international law to \n\nexplain the changes undergone by international law, the context in which questions \n\ninvolving state immunity and human rights come about is framed.  \n\n \n\n2.1 Discourses on the foundations of the law of state immunity  \n\n \n\n2.1.1 Notion and functions  \n\n \n\nAs codified by the ILC in Article 5 of the UNCJISP, state immunity is the \n\nimmunity enjoyed by a state in respect of itself (\u2018jurisdictional immunity\u2019) and its property \n\n(\u2018enforcement immunity\u2019) from the jurisdiction of the courts of another state.1 Regarding \n\nthe raison d\u2019\u00eatre of immunities, the Resolution adopted in 2009 in Naples by the IDI stated \n\nthat \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [i]mmunities are conferred to ensure an orderly allocation and exercise of jurisdiction in \n\naccordance with international law in proceedings concerning States, to respect the sovereign \n\nequality of States and to permit the effective performance of the functions of persons who act \n\non behalf of States.\u20192 \n\n \n\n                                                \n1 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property (adopted 2 December \n2004, not yet entered into force) (2005) 44 ILM 803.

According to the Thai Ambassador, this relativity has at \n\nleast three strands.3 In the first place, \u2018\u2026 it does not impose an obligation to grant \n\nimmunity beyond the extent recognized by customary international law.\u2019 4  Sompong \n\nSucharitkul mentions that to accord immunity beyond the legitimate extent is not a \n\nviolation of a rule of law5, but that is open to debate since it can be argued that it may \n\nconflict with the individual\u2019s right of access to justice as protected, for instance, in Articles \n\n6.1 and 13 of the ECHR and Articles 8 and 25 of the ACHR. Secondly, it is relative in the \n\nsense that it has a connection to the consent of the state against which legal proceedings \n\nare initiated.6  As Sucharitkul emphasizes, said consent can only be implied by a positive \n\nconduct\u2013\u2013and once it is given, immunity disappears without leaving any trace of impeding \n\nthe operation of jurisdiction.7 Thirdly, the Thai Ambassador adds that state immunity is \n\nonly from jurisdiction\u2013\u2013and not from substantive law, which applies independently of the \n\nexercise of jurisdiction.8 The responsibility of the state for its wrongful acts is engaged \n\nautomatically.  \n\nThe concept of immunity is not in itself problematic\u2014in simple terms, state \n\nimmunity exempts one state from the adjudicatory jurisdiction of another state in certain \n\nsituations. 9  Furthermore, there is a consensus that immunity is now restricted. \n\nNevertheless, the foundations and scope of state immunity are still a matter of debate. \n                                                \n3 Sompong Sucharitkul, \u2018Development and Prospects of the Doctrine of State Immunity \u2014 Some Aspects of \nCodification and Progressive Development\u2019 (1982) 29(2) NILR 252, 253-254.  \n4 ibid 253. \n5 ibid 254. \n6 ibid. \n7 ibid. \n8 ibid. \n9 See David Kennedy, International Legal Structures (Nomos 1987) 153-154 (footnotes omitted): \n \n\n\u2018Like other jurisdictional discourses, sovereign immunity doctrine resolves conflicting claims \nto authority without overt reference to norms of substance. Somewhat simplified, the doctrine \nof sovereign immunity exempts one sovereign from the municipal jurisdiction of another in \ncertain situations. Both sovereigns might claim authority over the situation. In any dispute, \nonly one can win. The discourse of immunity delimits the situations in which the territorial \njurisdiction of one sovereignty gives away to the authority of another. Except in a very recent \nstrand of the discourse, this is done without reference to the relative merits of the substantive \nrules each would apply.  \n\u2018Immunity doctrine resolves not only a clash between two sovereign authorities but also \nbetween two aspects of the sovereignty of the territorial state. Typically, the foreign state has \ngotten in a wrangle with the citizens of the home state who seek relief in their court system. \nThe court must then choose between the municipal rights of the citizens whose protection \ndefines sovereign authority and the international rights of the foreign sovereign whose \nreciprocal respect defines sovereignty as well. When made in the rhetoric of sovereign \nimmunity, this choice does not present a material hierarchy among various rights\u2014comparing, \nfor example, what the foreign state and the citizen require.\u2019 \n\n\n\n9  \n\nThese debates matter because different understandings on these subjects lead to different \n\nnormative consequences.  \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Sovereign equality or adjudicatory jurisdiction?  \n\n  \n\nIn 1812, the US Supreme Court delivered its judgment in The Schooner Exchange v \n\nMcFaddon. This case concerned the seizure of a private ship, which was \u2018violent and \n\nforcibly taken \u2026 out of the custody of the libellants\u2019 under the orders of the Emperor of \n\nFrance.10 When said ship anchored on the port of Philadelphia due to \u2018great stress of \n\nweather upon the high seas\u2019, its former owners filed a libel claiming ownership of the \n\nvessel.11 The claim was ultimately dismissed based on the immunity of the warship of a \n\nforeign sovereign. Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court. He \n\nidentified a conflict of principles that to this day govern the discourses on the foundations \n\nof the law of state immunity: the principles of territorial jurisdiction and sovereign \n\nequality.12  \n\nChief Justice Marshall referred to the principle of territorial jurisdiction in the \n\nfollowing way: \n\n \n\u2018The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute. It \n\nis susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself. Any restriction upon it deriving validity \n\nfrom an external source would imply a diminution of its sovereignty to the extent of the \n\nrestriction and an investment of that sovereignty to the same extent in that power which could \n\nimpose such restriction. \n\n\u2018All exceptions, therefore, to the full and complete power of a nation within its own territories \n\nmust be traced up to the consent of the nation itself. They can flow from no other legitimate \n\nsource.\u201913 \n\n \n\nThe principle of sovereign equality, in its turn, was presented in the following \n\nmanner: \n\n  \n\n                                                \n10 The Schooner Exchange v McFaddon (1812) 11 US (7 Cranch) 116 (Supreme Court of the United States) \n<https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/11/116/case.html> accessed 26 November 2015, 117. \n11 ibid 117-119. \n12 See Lee M. Caplan, \u2018State Immunity, Human Rights, and Jus Cogens: A Critique of the Normative \nHierarchy Theory\u2019 (2003) 97(4) AJIL 741, 745-748. \n13 The Schooner Exchange (n 10) 136. \n\n\n\n10  \n\n\u2018The world [is] composed of distinct sovereignties, possessing equal rights and equal \n\nindependence \u2026  \n\n\u2018[The] full and absolute territorial jurisdiction, being alike the attribute of every sovereign and \n\nbeing incapable of conferring extraterritorial power, would not seem to contemplate foreign \n\nsovereigns nor their sovereign rights as its objects.\u201914 \n\n \n\nPrima facie, the principle of territorial jurisdiction granted authority for the United \n\nStates to adjudicate the dispute, in the same way that the principle of sovereign equality \n\ndemanded the United States to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over the dispute.15 \n\nSince these principles are not in a hierarchical relationship, choosing one over the other \n\nwould amount to a violation of one of the parties\u2019 rights. Chief Justice Marshall did away \n\nwith the conflict by resorting to the notion of tacit consent:  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [The] mutual benefit [of distinct sovereignties being] promoted by intercourse with each \n\nother and by an interchange of those good offices which humanity dictates and its wants \n\nrequire, all sovereigns have consented to a relaxation in practice, in cases under certain \n\npeculiar circumstances, of that absolute and complete jurisdiction within their respective \n\nterritories which sovereignty confers. \n\n\u2018This consent may in some instances be tested by common usage and by common opinion, \n\ngrowing out of that usage.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 This perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns, and this common interest \n\nimpelling them to mutual intercourse, and an interchange of good offices with each other have \n\ngiven rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a \n\npart of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction which has been stated to be the attribute \n\nof every nation.\u201916 \n\n \n\nMarshall gave three examples of exceptions to the exercise of territorial \n\njurisdiction: the immunity of the person of the sovereign, of foreign ministers and of armed \n\nforces (\u2018troops of a foreign prince\u2019) that are allowed to enter the territory of the state.17 \n\n In order to uphold France\u2019s immunity without encroaching the United States\u2019 right \n\nto territorial jurisdiction, Chief Justice Marshall had to rely on a fiction by asserting the \n\nUnited States had tacitly consented to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction.18 With a \n\n                                                \n14 The Schooner Exchange (n 10) 136-137. \n15 See Caplan (n 12) 746-747 and Kennedy (n 9) 155-165.  \n16 The Schooner Exchange (n 10) 136-137. \n17 ibid 137-140. \n18 See also Kennedy (n 9) 155-165. \n\n\n\n11  \n\nview to strengthening his argument, Chief Justice Marshall referred to an excerpt of \n\nVattel\u2019s treatise on the law of nations. In the words of Vattel: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 it is impossible to conceive that the prince who sends an ambassador or any other minister, \n\ncan have any intention of subjecting him to the authority of a foreign power: and this \n\nconsideration furnishes an additional argument which completely establishes the independency \n\nof a public minister. If it cannot be reasonably presumed that his sovereign means to subject \n\nhim to the authority of the prince to whom he is sent, the latter, in receiving the minister, \n\nconsents to admit him on the footing of independency: and thus there exists between the two \n\nprinces a tacit convention which gives a new force to the natural obligation.\u201919  \n\n \n\nChief Justice Marshall extended the same understanding to the situation of a \n\nforeign public armed ship that, in a situation of distress, is allowed to anchor in a foreign \n\nport:  \n\n \n\u2018[It is] impossible \u2026 to conceive, whatever may be the construction as to private ships, that a \n\nprince who stipulates a passage for his troops or an asylum for his ships of war in distress \n\nshould mean to subject his army or his navy to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign. And if \n\nthis cannot be presumed, the sovereign of the port must be considered as having conceded the \n\nprivilege to the extent in which it must have been understood to be asked. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [A public armed ship] constitutes a part of the military force of her nation; acts under the \n\nimmediate and direct command of the sovereign; is employed by him in national objects. He \n\nhas many and powerful motives for preventing those objects from being defeated by the \n\ninterference of a foreign state. Such interference cannot take place without affecting his power \n\nand his dignity. The implied license, therefore, under which such vessel enters a friendly port \n\nmay reasonably be construed, and it seems to the Court ought to be construed, as containing \n\nan exemption from the jurisdiction of the sovereign within whose territory she claims the rites \n\nof hospitality.\u201920 \n\n \n\nApplying this understanding to the case at hand, Chief Justice Marshall concluded \n\nthat \n\n \n\n                                                \n19 Emer de Vattel, The Law of Nations, Or, Principles of the Law of Nature, Applied to the Conduct and \nAffairs of Nations and Sovereigns, with Three Early Essays on the Origin and Nature of Natural Law and on \nLuxury, edited and with an Introduction by B\u00e9la Kapossy and Richard Whitmore (Liberty Fund 2008) \n<http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2246> accessed 30 October 2015. \n20 The Schooner Exchange (n 10) 143-144 (emphasis added). \n\n\n\n12  \n\n\u2018\u2026 the Exchange, being a public armed ship in the service of a foreign sovereign with whom \n\nthe government of the United States is at peace, and having entered an American port open for \n\nher reception on the terms on which ships of war are generally permitted to enter the ports of a \n\nfriendly power, must be considered as having come into the American territory under an \n\nimplied promise that while necessarily within it and demeaning herself in a friendly manner, \n\nshe should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country.\u201921 \n\n \n\nAs pointed out by David Kennedy, the implications drawn out by Marshall could \n\nbe reversed: \n\n \n\u2018One could image the U.S. having consented to entry only upon the grounds that France submit \n\nto its jurisdiction and France having accepted this condition. The point is that the consensual \n\nrhetoric allows Marshall to make an argument which relies upon a view of the substantive \n\nlimits of sovereignty seem independent of substantive choice.\u201922 \n\n \n\nIn Schooner Exchange, as previously analyzed, Chief Justice Marshall did away \n\nwith the conflict between sovereign equality and territorial jurisdiction by resorting to \n\nimplicit consent. As described by Caplan, these two principles gave rise to two different \n\ntheoretical approaches to state immunity.23 Adopting one approach or the other has great \n\npractical consequences, and more so as regards the relationship between state immunity \n\nand human rights. The first approach asserts that, since state immunity stems from the \n\nprinciple of sovereign equality, it is a fundamental right of the state, hence the maxim par \n\nin parem non habet imperium.24 The second, that sovereign immunity is an exception to \n\nthe principle of territorial jurisdiction.25  \n\nLee M. Caplan put forth the view that the second perspective is more compelling \n\nbased on several grounds. Caplan makes the case that the true meaning of the principle of \n\nsovereign equality does not entail as a corollary the maxim par in parem non habet \n\nimperium. According to Caplan, sovereign equality means that states are equal in their \n\ncapacity for rights.26 Caplan argues that, in international law, there is a correspondence \n\n                                                \n21 The Schooner Exchange (n 10) 147. \n22 David Kennedy (n 9) 164. \n23 Caplan (n 12) 748 \n24 ibid. \n25 ibid 749. \n26 ibid 751-752. \n\n\n\n13  \n\nbetween sovereign authority and national borders, ie \u2018a state\u2019s capacity for rights, like \n\nstatehood itself, is linked to a defined geographical area\u2019.27 Accordingly,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 a state\u2019s capacity for right stands at its apogee when applied in relation to its own territory \n\nand citizens.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 Conversely, by simple operation of the principle of sovereign equality, a state\u2019s capacity \n\nfor rights will diminish when in direct conflict with another state\u2019s sphere of authority, i.e., the \n\njurisdiction of that state over persons, property, and events in its national territory. \u2026 [T]he \n\nsame principle of sovereign equality that entitles the foreign sovereign to govern with respect \n\nto its own national territory now excludes it from exercising authority in another state\u2019s \n\nterritory. In such cases, the foreign state\u2019s capacity for rights with respect to the forum state \n\nreaches its lowest ebb.\u201928  \n\n \n\nThis is why Caplan concludes that the maxim par in parem non habet imperium \n\ndoes not reflect properly how the international legal order works. Caplan contends that \n\nstate immunity is a privilege, and not a right, and that the principle par in parem non habet \n\nimperium distorts the meaning of the principle of sovereign equality, which refers to a \n\nstate\u2019s capacity for rights.29  \n\nCaplan also argues that the view of state immunity as a fundamental state right has \n\nbeen used to justify the absolute theory of state immunity. And absolute immunity is, on its \n\nturn, a myth. According to Caplan\u2019s account, the exemption from jurisdiction generally \n\naccorded to states in the eighteenth and nineteenth century was not a result of the \n\napplication of a blanket rule of state immunity, but of practical considerations: \n\n \n\u2018In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, sovereigns interacted with one another in \n\npeacetime in a very limited way, predominantly through diplomatic intercourse or military \n\ncooperation. Consequently, inter-state disputes almost inevitably touched upon sensitive \n\nforeign policy matters. The law of state immunity reflected these sensitivities and the \n\nprevailing preference for resolving these disputes by diplomacy, rather than adjudication. Most \n\nlikely, claims against states in respect of private conduct\u2014though technically not barred from \n\nforeign adjudication\u2014were also handled diplomatically in accordance with the prevailing \n\nstate-centric paradigm. Thus, one cannot equate the fact that courts did not exercise jurisdiction \n\n                                                \n27 Caplan (n 12) 752. \n28 ibid (footnotes omitted). \n29 ibid 753. \n\n\n\n14  \n\nover foreign states in this early period with a general prohibition against doing so on account of \n\nthe principle of sovereign equality.\u201930 \n\n \n\nCaplan considers that the advent of the restrictive theory of state immunity is also \n\nat odds with the fundamental right approach to state immunity. In Caplan\u2019s view, \u2018if state \n\nimmunity were a fundamental state right, it would never be susceptible to theoretical \n\ndivision along public/private lines.\u201931 \n\nThe perspective according to which adjudicatory jurisdiction ought to be the \n\nstarting point\u2013\u2013and state immunity, an exception derived from the forum state\u2019s waiver of \n\nadjudicatory jurisdiction\u2014is, according to Caplan, not only a more \u2018persuasive and \n\nrealistic\u2019 explanation of the doctrine of state immunity, but also a more \u2018sensible \n\ninternational policy\u2019.32 As he explains: \n\n \n\u2018States understood to possess a fundamental right to immunity would be permitted to act with \n\nimpunity. Carried to the logical extreme, this notion would mean that foreign states acting in \n\ntheir foreign capacity could never be held accountable by the forum state. On the other hand, if \n\nstate immunity is considered a practical courtesy, capable of being modified (or even \n\nwithdrawn, if need be), then a more balanced relationship is maintained between the foreign \n\nstate and the forum state. A foreign state will be more cautious about treading on the interests \n\nof other states, fearing that unacceptable conduct will result in the withdrawal of immunity \n\nand, in turn, the review of such conduct by domestic courts.\u201933 \n\n  \n\nAlthough Caplan contends that state immunity ought to be seen as a \u2018practical \n\ncourtesy\u2019 and as a privilege, later in his article he concedes that  \u2018\u2026 the practice by states \n\nof waiving adjudicatory jurisdiction to create immunity privileges has created binding \n\nnorms through the development of international custom as to only a core body of state \n\nconduct.\u201934 According to him these binding norms do not comprehend \u2018state conduct \u2026 \n\nthat undermines the aim and purpose of the international legal order.\u201935 In sum, Caplan \n\nproposes a functional approach to state immunity, according to which immunity should be \n\naccorded only when it helps promoting the interests of the community of states. \n\nRosalyn Higgins is also one of the proponents that sovereign immunity should be \n\n                                                \n30 Caplan (n 12) 754. \n31 ibid. \n32 ibid 754-755. \n33 ibid 755. \n34 ibid 771. \n35 ibid. \n\n\n\n15  \n\nseen as an exception to the principle of jurisdiction.36 She pointed out that the concepts that \n\nhad been used to justify the absolute doctrine of state immunity (the equality and \n\nindependence of states, the dignity of the sovereign, and the comity of nations), given the \n\nshift to the restrictive doctrine, do not make much sense any longer.37 In her view, the \n\nequality of nations \u2018\u2026 now requires that States should not, by choosing to involve \n\nthemselves in the field of trade, unilaterally be entitled to extended immunities that other \n\nStates, which leave trade to the commercial sector, do not claim.\u201938 Accordingly, she \n\nmaintains that the concept of the dignity of the sovereign has now changed and that it \n\ncannot be understood as contrary to the dignity of the sovereign to submit to the rule of \n\nlaw.39 As regards the principle of the comity of nations, Rosalyn Higgins highlighted that it \n\n\u2018\u2026 can only emphasize the important fact that the circumstances in which immunity will \n\nnot be granted or withheld should be founded on international consensus, but cannot \n\notherwise give guidance as to how the distinction is to be operated.\u201940 \n\nAlthough the critiques presented by Caplan and Higgins are powerful, the orthodox \n\nview of state immunity still seems to consider it as a corollary of the principle of sovereign \n\nequality, which should then function as the starting point of analysis. As Lorna McGregor \n\npointed out,  \n\n \n\u2018[i]n civil actions brought against a foreign state or its officials, courts tend either to focus on \n\nthe availability of immunity without first addressing the jurisdictional basis for the case or to \n\nconflate both jurisdiction and immunity into a simultaneous and overlapping analysis. Such an \n\napproach suggests that immunity constitutes the primary rule instead of reflecting its \n\nexceptionality which, but for the foreign state\u2019s involvement, would enable the courts of the \n\nforum state to exercise jurisdiction.\u201941 \n \n\nThis is reflected in the approach adopted by most codifications of the law of state \n\nimmunity (the UNCJISP 2004, the ECSI 1972, the FSIA 1976, the SIA 1978), which \n\nemployed the technique of establishing a general rule of immunity and providing for the \n\nexceptions.  \n\n                                                \n36 Rosalyn Higgins, \u2018Certain Unresolved Aspects of the Law of State Immunity\u2019 in Rosalyn Higgins, Themes \nand Theories; Selected Essays, Speeches and Writings in International Law (Vol 1, OUP 2009) 376. \n37 ibid. \n38 ibid. \n39 ibid. \n40 ibid 377. \n41 Lorna McGregor, \u2018Torture and State Immunity: Deflecting Impunity, Distorting Sovereignty\u2019 (2008) 18(5) \nEJIL 903, 914. \n\n\n\n16  \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Other views \n\n \n\n2.1.3.1 Dionisio Anzilotti  \n\n \n\nIn an article published in 1911, Anzilotti contended that states had the right to \n\njurisdictional immunity but for a few exceptions. He did so, however, by resorting to a \n\ndifferent basis than that relied upon by most proponents of the absolute theory of state \n\nimmunity.   \n\nAnzilotti\u2019s starting point is that there is a distinction between the recognition of a \n\nstate as a subject of international law and the recognition of the domestic legal personality \n\nof a foreign state. The former is an act of international law, whilst the latter is an act of \n\ndomestic law.42 The recognition of the legal personality of a foreign state under domestic \n\nlaw is, in Anzilotti\u2019s perspective, a manifestation of the power of imperium of the forum \n\nstate. As such, the foreign state enters this relationship as a subject of the sovereign power \n\nof the forum state. As put by Anzilotti: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026[L]o Stato \u2026 pu\u00f2 entrare in rapporti di diritto che si svolgono nel seno di un\u2019altra comunit\u00e0 \n\ngiuridica statuale solamente come un membro di questa comunit\u00e0, sia pur temporaneo e a certi \n\neffetti soltanto; e quindi come sottoposto al potere che v\u2019impera. Per tal via appunto diviene \n\npossibile che le leggi di uno Stato accordino diritti ed impongano doveri ad un altro Stato, \n\ncomportandosi in confronto a lui come agli altri membri della comunit\u00e0 e si formano fra gli \n\nStati medesimi delle relazione giuridiche, che metton capo alla loro capacit\u00e0 di diritto pubblico \n\no privato, e non sono quindi n\u00e8 possono essere regolate dal diritto internazionale.\u201943 \n\n \n\nAnzilotti posits that the question that has to be answered is whether a state, as a \n\nsubject of legal relations under the domestic law of another state, has an international right \n\nto jurisdictional immunity: \n\n \n\u2018Invece di discutere se lo Stato, per la natura sua e per le qualit\u00e0 di cui \u00e8 investito, pu\u00f2 andar \n\nsottoposto alla giurisdizione di un altro Stato, si deve partire dal principio che lo Stato pu\u00f2 \n\nentrare in rapporti giuridici rispetto ai quali \u00e8 sottoposto alla potest\u00e0 di un altro Stato, e vedere \n\n                                                \n42  Dionisio Anzilotti, \u2018L\u2019esenzione degli Stati stranieri dalla giurisdizione (saggio di critica e di \nricostruzione)\u2019 in Dionisio Anzilotti, Opere (Vol 2, CEDAM 1960) 131. \n43 ibid 135 (footnotes omitted).  \n\n\n\n17  \n\nse, relativamente ad essi, esista un principio di diritto internazionale che obblighi gli Stati ad \n\nastenersi dall\u2019esercitare quella giurisdizione che altrimenti avrebbero \u2026\u201944 \n\n \n\nIn Anzilotti\u2019s perspective, therefore, immunity is a right enjoyed by the foreign \n\nstate as subject to the authority of another state, which grants immunity as a result of the \n\nduty to do so under international law. In other words, the claim a foreign state has to \n\nimmunity is founded on customary international law, but the foreign state does not enjoy it \n\nas a subject of international law, but as a legal person under the domestic law of the forum \n\nstate. In Anzilotti\u2019s words: \n\n \n\u2018Il fatto che l\u2019immunit\u00e0 di giurisdizione non \u00e8 la conseguenza logica dell\u2019eguaglianza degli \n\nStati propria dei rapporti internazionali, ma una prerogativa concessa dall\u2019autorit\u00e0 statuale ad \n\nun ente subordinato, spiega l\u2019esistenza di limiti dell\u2019immunit\u00e0 stessa, ossia di casi nei quali uno \n\nStato trovasi effettivamente sottoposto alla potest\u00e0 giurisdizionale di un altro Stato: dove, per \n\nqualsiasi motivo, la concessione vien meno, rimane integro il rapporto di subordinazione \n\ncaratteristico delle relazioni giuridiche di cui si parla, rapporto che la concessione restringe o \n\nmodifica nelle sue pratiche conseguenze, ma non distrugge certamente n\u00e9 nega.  \n\n\u2018Sarebbero invece inesplicabili questi casi se l\u2019esenzione dalla giurisdizione fosse conseguenza \n\ned applicazione dei principi di eguaglianza ed indipendenza degli Stati, perch\u00e9 non \u00e8 \n\nconcepibile potest\u00e0 d\u2019impero sopra un ente perfettamente eguale e completamente autonome, \n\nqualunque sia l\u2019indole e la natura del fatto per cui quella potest\u00e0 dovrebbe esercitarsi. Si \n\nl\u2019eguaglianza e l\u2019indipendenza degli Stati escludono l\u2019esercizio della giurisdizione dell\u2019uno in \n\nconfronto all\u2019altro quando si tratta di rapporti contrattuali o da fatto illecito, non si pu\u00f2 \n\nammettere che lo stesso principio non valga anche per le controversie relative a beni immobili: \n\nammettere la subordinazione anche in un sol caso vuol dire ammetterne la possibilit\u00e0, ossia \n\nnegare il significato attribuito un momento prima alla posizione reciproca degli Stati.\u201945 \n\n \n\nAnzilotti, therefore, dismisses the understanding according to which state immunity \n\nis a manifestation of the equality and independence of states under international law. To \n\nAnzilotti, in matters of immunity, the equality and independence of states is immaterial, \n\nsince immunity is granted to the foreign state when it appears as subject of legal relations \n\nunder domestic law, and not under international law, although the concession of immunity \n\nis done to fulfill an obligation under international law: immunity is, then, \u2018\u2026 un diritto che \n\nlo Stato accorda a subietti subordinati, per adempire un dovere impostogli dalle norme \n\n                                                \n44 Anzilotti (n 42) 144-145 (footnotes omitted).  \n45 ibid 165 (footnotes omitted). \n\n\n\n18  \n\ngiuridiche internazionali.\u201946 At the time Anzilotti wrote his article, he found \u2018\u2026 in modo \n\nnon dubbio la persuasione che uno Stato non possa, fuori di certo casi eccezionali ben \n\ndeterminati, essere obbligato a sottostare alla giurisdizione di un altro Stato\u201947, and this is \n\nthe reason why he is considered one of the proponents of absolute immunity. \n\nAnzilotti\u2019s attempt to reconstruct the foundations of the law of state immunity is \n\ninteresting because, although he found at the time there were few exceptions to the \n\nobligation states have to accord immunity to a foreign state, he did so on the basis of the \n\nexistence of customary international law requiring it, and not on the basis of the sovereign \n\nequality and independence of states. If it was the case that state immunity derived from the \n\nsovereign equality and independence of states, then that would not account for the \n\nexistence of some restrictions to the rule, as demonstrated by the widely recognized \n\nexception to state immunity as regards immovable property owned by the foreign state in \n\nthe territory of the forum state.  \n\n \n\n2.1.3.2 Hersch Lauterpacht  \n\n \n\nLauterpacht, in an article published in 1951, proposed that the position of foreign \n\nstates should be assimilated to that of organs of the forum state before its courts.48 He \n\nrejected the restrictive doctrine of state immunity because, according to him, the \n\ndistinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis could not \u2018\u2026 accurately or \n\nprofitably be accepted as the basis of future law.\u201949 A closer look will be taken at \n\nLauteparcht\u2019s critique of this distinction in a later section of this chapter. \n\nLauterpacht expressed the view according to which there was \u2018no rule of \n\ninternational law which obliges states to grant jurisdictional immunity to other states\u2019.50 As \n\nput by Lauterpacht, assuming that the duty of municipal courts to abstain from exercising \n\njurisdiction over foreign states stems from the independence and equality of nations, \n\n \n\u2018[i]t is not explained why, if immunity from jurisdiction is a rule of international law, it should \n\nnot apply to acts jure gestionis; or, assuming that absolute immunity from jurisdiction was \n\noriginally a rule of international law, when and how states consented to a limitation of that rule \n\n                                                \n46 Anzilotti (n 42) 185. \n47 ibid 154. \n48 Hersch Lauterpacht, \u2018The Problem of Jurisdictional Immunities of Foreign States\u2019 (1951) 28 BYIL 220, \n226 \n49 ibid 227. \n50 ibid 228. \n\n\n\n19  \n\nin matters jure gestionis. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [N]o legitimate claim of sovereignty is violated if the courts of a state assume jurisdiction \n\nover a foreign state with regard to contracts concluded or torts committed in the territory of the \n\nstate assuming jurisdiction. On the contrary the sovereignty, the independence, and the equality \n\nof the latter are denied if the foreign state claims as a matter of right\u2013\u2013as a matter of \n\ninternational law\u2013\u2013to be above the law of the state within the territory of which it has engaged \n\nin legal transactions or committed acts entailing legal consequences according to the law of \n\nthat state. The absence of any denial of independence or equality appears even more clearly \n\nwhen the state exercising jurisdiction over a foreign state submits itself, within the same \n\nsphere, to the full operation of its own law without claiming any privileged status or \n\nimmunity.\u201951  \n\n \n\nFollowing Lauterpacht\u2019s line of thought, considering that nowadays the state is \n\nsubject to the full operation of its own law before its courts, it would actually be more \n\nconsonant with the principles of equality and independence of states if domestic courts \n\ncould exercise jurisdiction over foreign states,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 so long as the state exercising jurisdiction merely applies its ordinary law \u2026 and so long as \n\nit applies it in an unobjectionable manner not open to the reproach of a denial of justice or of \n\nthe disregard of the legislative and administrative sovereignty of the foreign state.\u201952   \n\n \n\n Indeed, the rationale for attributing immunity to foreign sovereigns followed from \n\nthe traditional immunity of the sovereign\u2013\u2013considered legibus solutus\u2013\u2013before his own \n\ncourts. Now that the state is subject to the jurisdiction of its own courts, it appears illogical \n\nthat foreign states are exempt from it. \n\nAs Lauterpacht articulated:  \n\n \n\u2018A state does not derogate from the dignity of another state by subjecting it to the normal \n\noperation of the law under proper municipal and international safeguards and on a footing of \n\nequality with the state within which it concludes a contract or commits a tort. The dignity of \n\nforeign states is no more impaired by their being subjected to the law, impartially applied, of a \n\nforeign country than it is by submission to their own law. As English judges have occasionally \n\nobserved, the dignity of a foreign state may suffer more from an appeal to immunity than from \n\na denial of it.\u201953 \n\n                                                \n51 Lauterpacht (n 48) 228-229. \n52 ibid 229. \n53 ibid 231-232 (footnotes omitted). \n\n\n\n20  \n\n  \n\nIn the light of these considerations, Lauterpacht proposed the abolition, subject to \n\nsome exceptions, of state immunity by an international agreement or unilateral legislative \n\naction of the states that subject their organs to the jurisdiction of their own courts.54 \n\nLauterpacht put forth four exceptions to his proposal of abolition of state immunity.55 \n\nFirstly, he considered that immunity ought to be maintained as regards legislative acts of \n\nforeign states and measures taken in pursuance thereof. Secondly, Lauterpacht maintained \n\nthat immunity should remain in respect of executive and administrative acts of the foreign \n\nstate that take place in its territory. Thirdly, Lauterpacht stated that immunity should \n\ncontinue as regards contracts which, by virtue of the rules of private international law, are \n\nnot within the jurisdiction of the courts of the forum state. Lastly, Lauterpacht considered \n\nthat diplomatic immunities should be maintained and that vessels and aircrafts belonging \n\nto the armed forces of a foreign state should not be subject to an action in rem, seizure, or \n\narrest. \n\n  \n\n2.1.3.3 James Crawford \n\n \n\nIn an article published in 1984, Crawford maintained that the \u2018\u2026 simple assertion, \n\npar in parem non habet jurisdictionem, which is said to underlie the principle of \n\njurisdictional immunity, is itself question-begging.\u201956 He also asserted that the distinction \n\nbetween acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis does not exist as a matter of positive \n\ninternational law, given the lack of consensus and of \u2018inherent plausibility\u2019.57 He sought to \n\nrearticulate the basis of state immunity as a rule of international law with a view to \n\ndifferentiating between immune and non-immune transactions under international law. \n\nCrawford found three rules underlying the notion of state immunity: (i) the international \n\ndispute settlement rule; (ii) the existence of matters that international law refers \n\nexclusively or primarily to the competence of states (ie, the domestic jurisdiction rule); and \n\n(iii) the exhaustion of local remedies rule.58  \n\nThe international dispute settlement rule establishes that a state \u2018\u2026 cannot be \n\n                                                \n54 Lauterpacht (n 48) 237. \n55 ibid 236-241. \n56 James Crawford, \u2018International Law and Foreign Sovereigns: Distinguishing Immune Transactions\u2019 (1983) \n54(1) BYIL 75, 77. \n57 ibid 88-89. \n58 ibid 78-85. \n\n\n\n21  \n\nrequired to submit to international adjudication without its consent.\u201959 As stated by the ICJ \n\nin Monetary Gold Taken from Rome: \u2018\u2026 [there is] a well-established principle of \n\ninternational law embodied in the Court\u2019s Statute, namely, that the Court can only exercise \n\njurisdiction over a State with its consent.\u201960 Said rule obviously does not apply directly to \n\nmunicipal courts, but, as stated by James Crawford,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [it] provides strong support by analogy, if not directly, for a rule of foreign State immunity \n\nin the rater limited areas governed by that jurisdictional rule. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [A]t least in limited circumstances, the international dispute settlement rule indicates, if it \n\ndoes not require, the adoption of a rule of deference by a municipal court, and that this rule is \n\nmost coherently treated as an immunity ratione personae of foreign States from adjudicatory \n\njurisdiction.\u201961  \n\n \n\nIn this perspective, as Crawford asserts, the domestic expression of the \n\ninternational dispute settlement rule is that, regarding transactions that are not within the \n\njurisdiction of the forum state under international law, domestic courts are not in a position \n\nto assert jurisdiction over a state that did not consent to it.62 Crawford adds that the \n\ninternational dispute settlement rule does not cover matters left to the jurisdiction of the \n\nforum state, hence it has a limited scope.63  \n\nFollowing Crawford\u2019s line of thought, the translation of the international dispute \n\nsettlement rule into a foreign state immunity rule is aided by the distinction between \n\ninternational and domestic jurisdiction and by the rule of exhaustion of local remedies.64  \n\nDomestic jurisdiction refers to \u2018\u2026 those transactions\u2013\u2013typically, transactions \n\nwithin the community of a particular State\u2013\u2013which international law refers primarily or \n\nexclusively to the competence of that State.\u201965 Crawford highlights that states are therefore \n\nautonomous to matters under their domestic jurisdiction\u2013\u2013and such autonomy would be \n\n                                                \n59 Crawford (n 56) 80 (footnotes omitted). \n60 Monetary Gold removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v.

As added by him:  \n \n\n\u2018Examples include the conferment of nationality on persons sufficiently connected with the \nState, the disposition of armed forces within the jurisdiction, and the exercise of legislative \npower over nationals resident within the State. For the most part such matters involve special \npowers exercised by the State or special relationships of State nationals with the State.\u2019 \n \n\n\n\n22  \n\nincompatible with the exercise of authority by foreign courts over these issues.66  \n\nThe exhaustion of local remedies rule establishes that parties aggrieved by a \n\nforeign state in its territory have to exhaust the local remedies available in the state in \n\nquestion before asking their own state to exercise diplomatic protection.67 As added by \n\nCrawford, although it may seem excessively restrictive, the exhaustion of local remedies \n\nrule does not apply to all disputes between foreign states and private parties (eg, disputes \n\narising outside the defendant state\u2019s jurisdiction, disputes in which a local remedy is \n\nunavailable or futile etc.).68 According to Crawford, \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the exhaustion of local remedies rule is, to say the least, consistent with a restricted \n\nimmunity rule allowing immunity to a defendant State with respect to transactions between \n\nthat State and private persons in its territory. The analogy is reinforced by the fact that both \n\nrules can be waived.\u201969 \n\n \n\nAs previously discussed, in Crawford\u2019s view, there are three rules of the \n\ninternational legal system that are consistent with the attribution of immunity ratione \n\npersonae to a foreign state and that may even require domestic courts to do so: the \n\ninternational dispute settlement rule, the existence of transactions that international law \n\nrefers to the competence of the state (the domestic jurisdiction rule), and the exhaustion of \n\nlocal remedies rule. As adverted by Crawford, these rules do not require domestic courts to \n\ndecline jurisdiction whenever a state is party to a dispute\u2013\u2013on the contrary, they leave \n\nroom for the assertion of domestic jurisdiction in many (or even most) cases.70  \n\nIn Crawford\u2019s analysis, the operation of these three rules does not support a \n\ndistinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis. Also, lacking an international \n\nconsensus in respect of the scope of acta jure gestionis, Crawford concludes that this \n\ndistinction \u2018\u2026 is radically defective and cannot claim to represent general international \n\nlaw.\u201971 As put by him \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [A]lthough there has been a tendency to assert the existence of a rule of restrictive \n\nimmunity predicated on a distinction between \u2018private\u2019, \u2018commercial\u2019 or \u2018non-governmental\u2019 \n\n                                                \n66 Crawford (n 56) 83. \n67 ibid 84 \n68 ibid \n69 ibid. \n70 ibid. \n71 ibid 89. \n\n\n\n23  \n\nacts of States and their \u2018public\u2019, \u2018non-commercial\u2019 or \u2018governmental\u2019 acts there is in \n\ninternational practice no consensus on any such distinction. Indeed, the better view is that, in \n\nthe absence of a worked-out distinction between \u2018public\u2019 and \u2018private\u2019 law as part of the lex \n\nfori, such a distinction is incoherent. Nor does it reflect the actual distinctions drawn between \n\nimmune and non-immune transactions in any of the recent international texts or municipal \n\nActs. The better approach is to deal with the specific categories or classes of case that have \n\narisen in practice and to elaborate specific rules for each such category, taking into account the \n\nreasons for extending immunity or asserting jurisdiction in that context. This is essentially the \n\napproach adopted in the United Kingdom Act and its counterparts, in the European Convention \n\nand (though to a rather lesser extent) in the United States and Canadian Acts. In this process it \n\nis necessary to have regard to the underlying reasons for extending immunity ratione personae \n\nto foreign States: in particular, the immunity from local jurisdiction of States with respect to \n\ntransactions essentially within their domestic jurisdiction, or governed directly by the \n\ninternational dispute settlement rule. Of course it is also necessary to respect specific \n\nimmunities established in international practice: in particular, the immunities of diplomatic and \n\nconsular personnel and premises and of foreign public ships from arrest. Considerations of \n\ncomity and reciprocity are also relevant, though the specific guidance they provide is, as usual, \n\nlimited.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 Despite statements to the effect that international law does not allow local jurisdiction to be \n\nexercised over foreign States in respect of their acts of sovereign authority, it is suggested that \n\nthis is not an accurate or comprehensive statement of the relevant principles. It has already \n\nbeen suggested that the various distinctions drawn between immune and non-immune \n\ntransactions are the result not of a single rule or principle but of a balance of principles and \n\nconsiderations. It follows that, provided local legislation reasonably reflects that balance, no \n\nfurther safeguard or prohibition is required.\u2019 72 \n\n \n\n2.2 The current scenario of the law of state immunity \n\n \n\n2.2.1 The acceptance of the restrictive theory \n\n \n\nThe standard textbook narrative on the history of the law of state immunity, as \n\nexemplified by Peter-Tobias Stoll, links its development with that of sovereignty and the \n\nterritorial state.73 In the Absolutist state, sovereignty was embodied in a person.74 As \n\nMalcolm Shaw describes, as a result of this \u2018mystique\u2019, sovereigns could not be subject to \n\nsuits in the courts of their countries and, accordingly, they could also not be made subject \n\n                                                \n72 Crawford (n 56) 114-115 (footnotes omitted). \n73 Stoll (n 1) para 4. \n74 ibid para 5; Malcolm Shaw, International Law (6th edn, CUP 2008) 697-698. \n\n\n\n24  \n\nto the jurisdiction of foreign courts.75 Stoll explains that, with the end of Absolutism and \n\nthe emergence of states as separate entities (in the sense that the state and sovereignty are \n\nno longer embodied in a person), state immunity starts to be considered separately.76  \n\nThe increasing engagement of the state in economic activities would have then \n\nstarted a movement from the absolute immunity approach, \u2018\u2026 whereby the sovereign was \n\ncomplete immune from foreign jurisdiction in all cases regardless of circumstances\u201977, to \n\nthe restrictive approach, \u2018\u2026 under which immunity was available as regards governmental \n\nactivity but not where the state was engaging in commercial activity.\u201978  \n\nThe idea that at some point absolute state immunity was a binding rule of \n\ninternational law has been contested. Byers sustains that, in international law, there was no \n\nbinding rule as regards state immunity before the acceptance of the restricted rule of state \n\nimmunity. As explained by him:  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 history suggests that there was no general rule regulating State immunity from jurisdiction \n\nprior to restrictive immunity becoming a rule of customary international law, and that a \n\nmistaken belief in such a pre-existing rule served to retard that later development.  \n\n\u2018Belgian courts were applying restrictive immunity as early as 1857, while Italian courts were \n\ndoing so in 1886, Swiss courts in 1918 and Austrian courts in 1919. Argentine and French \n\ncourts distinguished between acts jure imperii (of government) and acts jure gestionis (of a \n\ncommercial character) from 1924, Egyptian courts from 1926, Greek courts from 1928, Irish \n\ncourts from 1941 and German courts from 1949. \n\n\u2018During this period, courts in common law States were applying absolute immunity and \n\ncontinued to do so until legislative changes were introduced during the 1970s and 1980s. In the \n\nUnited Kingdom, for example, it was not until 1977 that Lord Denning and Justice Shaw \n\ncontroversially applied restrictive immunity in direct contradiction to clear precedents in \n\nEnglish common law.\u201979 \n\n  \n\nByers\u2019 findings that in some jurisdictions there was a mistaken belief in the \n\nexistence of an absolute rule of state immunity in international law is consistent with the \n\nconclusions arrived at by Gamal Moursi Badr, who, upon a close analysis of the early case-\n\nlaw in the United States and the United Kingdom, stated the following: \n\n \n\n                                                \n75 Shaw (n 74) 698. \n76 Stoll (n 1) paras 4, 5 and 6. \n77 Shaw (n 74) 701. \n78 ibid. \n79 Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules (CUP 2004) 111-112 (footnotes omitted).  \n\n\n\n25  \n\n\u2018\u2026 [T]he early decisions from the nineteenth century often cited in connection with state \n\nimmunity do not really relate to the subject as we know it today but rather to the particular \n\nimmunities of those physically transposed elements of the power structure of the foreign state \n\n[foreign ships and the person of the foreign sovereign], immunities which are distinguishable \n\nfrom what is now being debated in certain forums and being regulated by domestic legislation \n\nin certain countries under the heading of state immunity. It is nevertheless interesting to note \n\nthat the said early decisions did distinguish \u2026 between a foreign sovereign\u2019s public acts on the \n\none hand and his private acts on the other, stating in no uncertain terms that the latter enjoyed \n\nno immunity from the jurisdiction of the local courts. The continued citation of those early \n\ndecisions in support of the absolute theory of state immunity is therefore a curious \n\nphenomenon, due perhaps to a hasty perusal of those decisions or to second hand knowledge of \n\nthem.\u201980 \n\n \n\nAs pointed out by Byers, in the United Kingdom, there were judicial expressions of \n\ndissatisfaction with absolute immunity and the restrictive rule was already being applied in \n\nsome instances when the SIA came about in 1978, codifying the restrictive rule of state \n\nimmunity.81  \n\nIn the United States, the process towards the adoption of restricted immunity was \n\ndifferent. In Altmann v Republic of Austria, Justice Stevens, who delivered the opinion of \n\nthe Court, took the opportunity to contextualize the evolution of the application of state \n\nimmunity in the US until the enactment of the FSIA in 1976.82 Justice Stevens considered \n\nthat the main source of sovereign immunity jurisprudence in the US was Chief Justice \n\nMarshall\u2019s opinion in Schooner Exchange.83 He added that the practice of the Supreme \n\nCourt, in the light of \u2018\u2026 Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s observation that foreign sovereign \n\nimmunity is a matter of grace and comity rather than a constitutional requirement\u2019, was to \n\nconsistently defer to the decisions of the Executive on whether to exercise jurisdiction over \n\nactions against foreign states and their instrumentalities.84 In 1952, there was a change of \n\npolicy in the State Department, which decided to adopt, as enunciated in the \u2018Tate letter\u2019, \n\n                                                \n80 Gamal Moursi Badr, State Immunity: An Analytical and Prognostic View (Martinus Nijhoff 1984) 18-19. \n81 Byers (n 79) 111-112. \n82 Byers also presents an account of the practice regarding state immunity in the United States. See Byers (n \n79) 112-113. \n83 Republic of Austria v Altmann (2004) (03-13) 541 US 677; 327 F.3d 1246 (Supreme Court of the United \nStates)&lt;www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-13.ZO.html> accessed 30 October 2015.  \n84 ibid. It is interesting to note that Chief Justice Marshall did not employ the words \u2018grace\u2019 or \u2018comity\u2019 in the \nopinion he delivered for the Supreme Court in Schooner Exchange. See Schooner Exchange (n 10). \n\n\n\n26  \n\nthe restrictive theory of state immunity.85 Justice Stevens added that the \u2018Tate letter\u2019 had \n\nlittle impact on federal courts: they continued to defer to the Executive\u2019s opinion, which, \n\non its turn, was inconsistent in respect of the restrictive theory of immunity due to political \n\nconsiderations.86 At the same time, when courts had to determine whether state immunity \n\nexisted without relying on a suggestion of the State Department, they did not apply \n\nuniformly the existing criteria.87 It was for these reasons that Congress adopted the FSIA in \n\n1976, which \u2018[codified], as a matter of federal law, the restrictive theory of sovereign \n\nimmunity \u2026 and [transferred] primary responsibility for immunity determinations from \n\nthe Executive to the Judicial Branch\u2019.88 The FSIA was meant to be a \u2018comprehensive \n\nstatute containing a \u201cset of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil \n\naction against a foreign state or its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities.\u201d\u201989 \n\nByers points out the following reasons that justify the difference of attitude \n\nbetween common law and civil law countries as regards openness to the restrictive theory \n\nof state immunity:  \n\n  \n\u2018First, common law courts remained bound by the doctrine of crown immunity (\u2018sovereign \n\nimmunity\u2019 in the United States) long after civil law courts began to distinguish between \n\nimmune and non-immune acts of their own sovereigns. Secondly, courts in common law \n                                                \n85 Republic of Austria v Altmann (n 83). The \u2018Tate letter\u2019 (\u2018Changing Policy Concerning the Granting of \nSovereign Immunity to Foreign Governments\u2019, Letter to US Acting Attorney-General, 19 May 1952 (1952) \n26 US Department of State Bulletin 984) posited the following: \n \n\n\u2018It is thus evident that with the possible exception of the United Kingdom little support has \nbeen found except on the part of the Soviet Union and its satellites for continued full \nacceptance of the absolute theory of sovereign immunity. ... The reasons which obviously \nmotivate State trading countries in adhering to the theory with perhaps increasing rigidity are \nmost persuasive that the United States should change its policy. Furthermore, the granting of \nsovereign immunity to foreign governments in the courts of the United States is most \ninconsistent with the action of the Government of the United States in subjecting itself to suit \nin these same courts in both contract and tort and with its long established policy of not \nclaiming immunity in foreign jurisdictions for its merchant vessels. Finally, the Department \nfeels that the widespread and increasing practice on the part of governments of engaging in \ncommercial activities makes necessary a practice which will enable persons doing business \nwith them to have their rights determined in the courts. For these reasons it will hereafter be \nthe Department\u2019s policy to follow the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity in the \nconsideration of requests of foreign governments for a grant of sovereign immunity. \n\u2018It is realized that a shift in policy by the executive cannot control the courts but it is felt that \nthe courts are less likely to allow a plea of sovereign immunity where the executive has \ndeclined to do so. There have been indications that at least some Justices of the Supreme Court \nfeel that in this matter courts should follow the branch of the Government charged with \nresponsibility for the conduct of foreign relations.\u2019 \n \n\n86 Republic of Austria v Altmann (n 83). \n87 ibid. \n88 ibid. \n89 ibid (footnotes omitted).  \n\n\n\n27  \n\nsystems felt bound by the doctrine of stare decisis not to abandon their earlier applications of \n\nabsolute immunity. Thirdly, common law States had a less acute interest in the development of \n\nthe doctrine of restrictive immunity than most civil law States. The common law States were \n\neither large, such as the United States, or part of the former British Empire\u2014with its internal \n\ncohesion and historic, political and commercial ties. By contrast, the smaller civil law trading \n\nStates of continental Europe, such as the Netherlands and Belgium, were dependent to a far \n\ngreater extent on trade between fully sovereign States. \n\n\u2018However, it seems that the principle of legitimate expectation also played a role. In every \n\ncommon law jurisdiction, absolute immunity was viewed as the previously applicable rule of \n\ncustomary international law. Consequently, the changes in national laws were regarded as \n\nresponses to a change in the existing customary rule rather than as responses to the \n\ndevelopment of a new rule, even though it is apparent, from the earlier developments in civil \n\nlaw jurisdictions, that a customary rule of absolute State immunity could not have existed at \n\nany date after the very early twentieth century.\u201990 \n\n  \n\n2.2.2 Problems related to the distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure \n\ngestionis  \n\n \n\nAccording to Jasper Finke, the distinction between acts jure imperii and acts jure \n\ngestionis embodies the \u2018capitalist conception of the liberal state\u2019 and its \u2018inherent \n\ndistinction between private and public\u2019: economic transactions would have a private \n\ncharacter, thus they would not be protected by the veil of state immunity.91   \n\nAs posited by James Crawford, what is clear regarding state immunity is that it is \n\nnot absolute\u2013\u2013it is restricted. At the same time,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 we lack a rationale, a connected explanation, for this state of affairs, an articulated set of \n\ncriteria which would enable us to draw the distinction between cases in which States or their \n\ntransactions are entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of other States as a matter of \n\ninternational law and cases in which they are not.\u201992 \n\n \n\nIndeed, this lack of rationale for the distinction between acts jure imperii and jure \n\ngestionis resulted in inconsistent state practice. Lauterpacht, in 1951, made the following \n\nobservations:  \n\n \n\n                                                \n90 Byers (n 79) 114 (footnotes omitted). \n91 Jasper Finke, \u2018Sovereign Immunity: Rule, Comity or Something Else?\u2019 (2011) 21(4) EJIL 853, 865. \n92 Crawford (n 56) 75.  \n\n\n\n28  \n\n\u2018Courts of different countries\u2013\u2013and occasionally courts of the same country\u2013\u2013have treated the \n\nsame kind of activity in different ways. Thus the operation of railways by the state has been \n\nconsidered by some courts to be an activity of a public-law character; it has been regarded by \n\nothers as partaking of the nature of an undertaking of a private-law nature. \n\n\u2018\u2026 Moreover, it is no longer generally accepted that the economic activities of the state\u2013\u2013such \n\nas state management of industry, state buying, and state selling\u2013\u2013are necessarily of a purely \n\n\u2018private-law nature\u2019; that they are \u2018jure gestionis\u2019; and that in engaging in them a state acts like \n\na private person. In these and similar cases ostensibly removed from the normal field of its \n\npolitical and administrative activities, the state nevertheless acts as a public person for the \n\ngeneral purposes of the community as a whole.\u201993 \n\n \n\nHaving analyzed the practice of many state on many different issues, Lauterpacht \n\nconcluded that \u2018\u2026 the distinction between acts jure gestionis and acts jure imperii cannot \n\nbe placed on a sound logical basis.\u201994 Jasper Fink, in an article published in 2011, \n\nmaintained that there is still a lack of consistency in state practice.95 This is why he \n\nconcluded that foreign state immunity as a rule of customary law is characterized by an \n\nagreement between states concerning the concept itself and by substantial disagreement on \n\ndetail and substance, ie states are bound to respect foreign sovereign immunity, but on a \n\nhigh level of abstraction.96 \n\nThe most common criteria for distinguishing between acts jure imperii and jure \n\ngestionis refer either to the purpose or to the nature of the act in question. The purpose test, \n\nas pointed out by Rosalyn Higgins, has been generally rejected.97 It is unsatisfactory \n\nprecisely because of the reason indicated by Lauterpacht: all acts of a state ultimately have \n\na public purpose of some sort.98 The nature test is not entirely satisfactory either. A \n\nclassical formulation of the nature test is found on a course Andr\u00e9 Weiss, a former judge at \n\nthe extinct PCIJ, taught at the Hague Academy in 1923. The excerpt where he explains it is \n\nlong but worth reproducing: \n\n \n\u2018Il parait beaucoup plus s\u00fbr d\u2019admettre que la nature des actes accomplis par l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e9tranger \n\ndoit seule \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019accorder ou de d\u00e9nier aux tribunaux des \n\nautres pays le pouvoir d\u2019en conna\u00eetre. Par l\u00e0, nous rendons inutiles les distinctions que je \n\nsignalais tout \u00e0 l\u2019heure; le juge n\u2019a \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 aucune recherche d\u2019intention; et sa t\u00e2che \n                                                \n93 Lauterpacht (n 48) 222 and 224. \n94 ibid 224. \n95 Finke (n 91) 871. \n96 ibid 871. \n97 Higgins (n 36) 372. \n98 Lauterpacht (n 48) 224. \n\n\n\n29  \n\ndevient extr\u00eamement facile, puisqu\u2019elle se ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 une simple constatation de fait : Un acte \n\n\u00e9man\u00e9 d\u2019un gouvernement \u00e9tranger vient-il \u00e0 lui \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ? Pour savoir s\u2019il doit en retenir \n\nl\u2019examen, il n\u2019a qu\u2019une chose \u00e0 se demander : l\u2019acte litigieux est-il, par sa nature, tel qu\u2019en \n\naucun cas il ne puisse \u00eatre fait par d\u2019autres que par l\u2019\u00c9tat ou au nom de l\u2019\u00c9tat : dans ce cas, \n\nc\u2019est un acte de puissance publique, c\u2019est un acte politique, qui ne pourrait, sans atteinte \u00e0 la \n\nsouverainet\u00e9 de cet \u00c9tat, \u00eatre soumis au contr\u00f4le d\u2019une autorit\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8re. L\u2019incomp\u00e9tence \n\ns\u2019impose. Au contraire, l\u2019acte est-il de la nature de ceux que toute personne priv\u00e9e pourrait \n\naccomplir, tel qu\u2019un contrat, tel qu\u2019un emprunt, cet acte, quel que soit le but qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \n\nassign\u00e9, quel que soit le dessein qu\u2019il poursuit, est un acte priv\u00e9, et le tribunal \u00e9tranger saisi \n\nsera comp\u00e9tent pour en conna\u00eetre. Et nous en concluons que la comp\u00e9tence de ce tribunal ne \n\npourra \u00eatre d\u00e9clin\u00e9e, m\u00eame si le contrat litigieux affecte un caract\u00e8re administratif, s\u2019il r\u00e9alise \n\npar exemple l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un navire de guerre pour le compte de l\u2019\u00c9tat ou encore la \n\ncommande de munitions et d\u2019armes pour les arsenaux.\u201999 \n\n  \n\nThe test proposed by Weiss is, therefore, whether an individual could participate or \n\nnot in a given transaction, regardless of its object. The test is simple, but it raises many \n\ndifficulties. As Lauterpacht criticizes, following the nature test, contracts made by the state \n\nfor the purchase of shoes for the army, or of a warship, or of foodstuff necessary for the \n\nmaintenance of the national economy would be held not immune from jurisdiction because \n\nthey are contracts and individuals can conclude contracts.100 In Lauterpacht\u2019s view, the \n\napplication of the nature test as proposed by Weiss would ignore the reality that \n\nindividuals, after all, do not purchase shoes for their armies and do not buy warships either.  \n\nGamal Moursi Badr criticized the approach according to which the test to \n\ndifferentiate between public and private acts is whether an individual could also perform \n\nthe foreign state\u2019s disputed act. According to him, differences among legal orders make \n\nthis test impracticable. 101  Badr considers the employment of the lex fori to the \n\ncharacterization of the act in question as public or private is also not ideal for the same \n\nreasons. 102 Nevertheless, he maintains there are four \u2018intrinsic, objective and readily \n\napplicable\u2019 criteria to make the distinction between public and private acts: the formation \n\nof the act, the parties, the contents and the sanctions attaching to it.103 As regards the \n\nformation, he contends that a public act can be performed by the state alone, without any \n\n                                                \n99 Andr\u00e9 Weiss, \u2018Comp\u00e9tence ou incomp\u00e9tence des tribunaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des \u00e9tats \u00e9trangers\u2019 (1923) 1 RCADI \n521, 546. \n100 Lauterpacht (n 48) 225. \n101 Moursi Badr (n 80) 64. \n102 ibid 63-64. \n103 ibid 63-69. \n\n\n\n30  \n\nfurther collaboration, whilst private acts will normally depend on more than one person, \n\nlike contracts and torts.  In respect of the parties, a public act will always affect individuals \n\nand entities within the territorial jurisdiction of the state, while a private act, for the \n\npurposes of state immunity, will involve a party not subject to the state\u2019s jurisdiction. As \n\nregards the content, public acts regulate aspects of public interest and are determined by \n\ndeliberation and decision-making, while private acts accommodate two antagonistic \n\ninterests towards a common goal and are the result of negotiation and compromise. Finally, \n\nin respect of public acts, states have a coercive machinery to impose sanctions, while in \n\nrespect of private acts the state can only employ legal remedies which are also open to the \n\nother party. Gamal Moursi Badr\u2019s proposal is indeed interesting, but, lacking an \n\ninternational consensus in respect of it, it cannot solve the problem of inconsistency in the \n\ndistinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis. \n\nIn I Congreso del Partido, Lord Wilberforce proposed a so-called \u2018two-stage\u2019 or \n\n\u2018contextual\u2019 test in order to establish whether immunity should be granted or not.104 The \n\nfacts of the case occurred prior to the passing of the SIA 1978, which was not applied. \n\nLord Wilberforce made a summary of the facts of the case. The claim was brought against \n\nthe vessel I Congresso del Partido, owned by Cuba, but related to two sister ships: Marble \n\nIslands and Playa Larga.105 It related to a contract for a sale of sugar concluded in February \n\n1973 between a Cuban state trading enterprise (\u2018Cubazucar\u2019) and a Chilean company \n\n(\u2018Iansa\u2019).106 One shipment was carried on Playa Larga and another on Marble Islands.107 \n\nPlaya Larga was owned by Cuba and operated by a state enterprise (\u2018Mambisa\u2019), whilst the \n\nMarble Islands was a vessel owned by a Liechtenstein corporation.108 In September 1973, \n\nwhen the government of President Allende was overthrown by Pinochet, Cuba and Chile \n\nsevered diplomatic relations. Playa Larga was already discharging its cargo when it \n\nreceived orders from Cuba to leave Chile and meet Marble Islands, which was at sea.109 \n\nPlaya Larga ultimately returned to Cuba with a great part of the cargo, which was sold by \n\nMambisa.110 Marble Islands, on its turn, was ordered to discharge the cargo in North \n\nVietnam and had its ownership acquired by Cuba while on the high seas. The cargo was \n                                                \n104 I\u00ba Congreso del Partido [1983] 1 AC 244 (House of Lords)  \n<http://www.uniset.ca/other/css/19831AC244.html> accessed 26 November 2015; Shaw (n 74) 710-713; \nMartin Dixon, Textbook on International Law (6th edn, OUP 2007) 182-185.  \n105 I\u00ba Congreso del Partido (n 104) 257. \n106 ibid 258. \n107 ibid. \n108 ibid 258-259.  \n109 ibid 259. \n110 ibid. \n\n\n\n31  \n\nsold to a Cuban state enterprise (\u2018Alimport\u2019) and later donated to the people of North \n\nVietnam.111 The owners of the cargo laden on Playa Larga and Marble Islands brought \n\nactions against the owner of I Congreso del Partido, which was arrested at Sunderland. The \n\nRepublic of Cuba invoked its right to immunity.   \n\nLord Wilberforce considered that the restrictive doctrine of state immunity \n\napplied.112 One of the problems of the case was that, although the initial act was a \n\ncommercial transaction (the sale of sugar), the acts upon which the claims were based \n\ncould be considered to have been done jure imperii, since Cuba ordered the ships not to \n\nproceed with the discharge of the cargo due to political reasons. Lord Wilberforce \n\nconsidered the following:  \n\n \n\u2018Under the \u201crestrictive\u201d theory the court has first to characterise the activity into which the \n\ndefendant state has entered. Having done this, and (assumedly) found it to be of a commercial, \n\nor private law, character, it may take the view that contractual breaches, or torts, prima facie \n\nfall within the same sphere of activity. It should then be for the defendant state to make a case \n\n\u2026 that the act complained of is outside that sphere, and within that of sovereign action.\u2019113 \n\n\u2018\u2026 \n\n\u2018\u2026 in considering, under the \u201crestrictive\u201d theory whether state immunity should be granted or \n\nnot, the court must consider the whole context in which the claim against the state is made, \n\nwith a view to deciding whether the relevant act(s) upon which the claim is based, should, in \n\nthat context, be considered as fairly within an area of activity, trading or commercial, or \n\notherwise of a private law character, in which the state has chosen to engage, or whether the \n\nrelevant act(s) should be considered as having been done outside that area, and within the \n\nsphere of governmental or sovereign activity.\u2019114  \n\n \n\nAs regards the Playa Larga, which was at the relevant time owned by Cuba, Lord \n\nWilberforce considered that both the initial act and the act which gave rise to the claim did \n\nnot involve exercise of sovereign powers and were done by Cuba as owners of the ship.115 \n\nHe highlighted that the appellants were \u2018\u2026 certainly able to show, as a starting point, that \n\nthis vessel [the Playa Larga] was engaged in trade with the consent, if not with the active \n\nparticipation, of the Republic of Cuba.\u2019116 As regards the Marble Islands, Lord Wilberforce \n\n                                                \n111 I\u00ba Congreso del Partido (n 104) 259. \n112 ibid 261-262. \n113 ibid 265. \n114 ibid 267. \n115 ibid 267-269. \n116 ibid 267. \n\n\n\n32  \n\nconsidered there were some difficulties. In the first place, this vessel was initially not \n\nowned by Cuba. He underscored the following: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the Republic of Cuba had no concern with, interest in, or responsibility for the cargo or for \n\nthe operation of the ship or for the actions of the master or the crew. It was, of course, in a \n\nposition to control the acts of Mambisa, but the commercial venture was exclusively that of \n\nMambisa. The cargo owners did not do any business with a sovereign state.\u2019117 \n\n \n\nLord Wilberforce considered that, in the case of Marble Islands, by ordering the \n\nvessel to transfer the sugar to North Vietnam, Cuba acted in a governmental capacity, since \n\nit \u2018never entered\u2019 the \u2018operations of carriage, deposit and sale of the cargo\u2019, which were \n\ndone by Mambisa, and it only intervened to direct the transfer of the sugar.118 All their \n\nLordships agreed with Lord Wilberforce in respect of the Playa Larga, but the majority \n\ndisagreed with him regarding the Marble Islands. Lord Diplock, in respect of the Marble \n\nIslands, asserted that the act of discharging and selling the perishable cargo in North \n\nVietnam was \u2018\u2026 fairly and squarely based on private law (jus gestionis)\u2019119 He added that \n\n\u2018\u2026 the discharge and sale of the cargo to Alimport at Haiphong was \u2026 deliberately treated \n\nby the Cuban government as being effected under private and not in the exercise of any \n\nsovereign powers\u2019 and that these acts could be considered prima facie a tort of \n\nconversion.120 Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Bridge of Harwich concurred with Lord \n\nDiplock. Lord Bridge added that \u2018\u2026 assuming a conversion of the cargo by the Republic \n\nof Cuba (an assumption necessarily to be made at this stage), this was a breach of a private \n\nlaw obligation previously assumed when the Marble Islands was acquired.\u2019 121  Lord \n\nEdmund-Davies was the only one to agree with Lord Wilberforce that Cuba could rely on \n\nstate immunity as regards the Marble Islands cargo.122  \n\nAs can be seen from the case, the \u2018two-stage\u2019 or \u2018contextual\u2019 approach posited by \n\nLord Wilberforce did not solve the difficulties relating to the distinction between acta jure \n\nimperii and acta juri gestionis. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, there is also no \n\ninternational consensus on the distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure \n\ngestionis. Crawford goes further and asserts that the lack of a clear guidance on this matter \n\n                                                \n117 I\u00ba Congreso del Partido (n 104) 269. \n118 ibid 270-271. \n119 ibid 274-275.  \n120 ibid 275. \n121 ibid 279. \n122 ibid 276-277. \n\n\n\n33  \n\nfacilitates manipulation with a view to achieving a particular outcome and it can result in \n\nimmunity being accorded to \u2018public\u2019 acts even though there are good reasons for the \n\nexercise of jurisdiction by a domestic court.123 Given these difficulties, Crawford contends \n\nthat \u2018\u2026 it cannot seriously be argued that a distinction between \u201cpublic\u201d or \n\n\u201cgovernmental\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cnon-governmental\u201d transactions exists as a matter of \n\npositive international law.\u2019 124 This is why he tried to rearticulate the basis of state \n\nimmunity, as analyzed in a previous section of this chapter.  \n\nThere is also another problem as regards the distinction between acta jure imperii \n\nand acta jure gestionis. The main statutes and treaties codifying the law of state immunity \n\nwere inspired by it, but did not incorporate it.125 As a result, some states may entertain \n\njurisdiction over acts that are not jure gestionis. This can be exemplified by the case \n\nLetelier v Republic of Chile.126 The claim was brought by, among others, the widow and \n\nsons of Chilean Ambassador Orlando Letelier, following his assassination, which took \n\nplace in Washington, D.C. on 21 September 1976. The plaintiffs sought damages for \n\ntortious injuries suffered as a result of the assassination, which was allegedly committed by \n\npeople under the direction of Chile\u2019s intelligence organ.127 Section 1605.5 of the FSIA \n\nprovides that a foreign state is not immune for torts committed in the forum state.128 \n\nSection 1605.a.5.A, however, establishes that the \u2018tort exception\u2019 is not applicable to \u2018any \n\nclaim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a \n\ndiscretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused\u2019.129 The District \n\nCourt found that, for the purposes of Section 1605.a.5.A, the order of the Chilean Republic \n\nfor its organs to perpetrate the conducts that culminated in the assassination of Orlando \n\n                                                \n123 Crawford (n 56) 90. \n124 ibid 90-91. \n125 See Finke (n 91) 858-861. The ECSI does mention the expression \u2018jure imperii\u2019 in two provisions. Article \n24 of the ECSI allows any state \u2018\u2026 to declare that, in cases not falling within Articles 1 to 13, its courts shall \nbe entitled to entertain proceedings against another Contracting State to the extent that its courts are entitled \nto entertain proceedings against States not party to the present Convention\u2019, but \u2018without prejudice to the \nimmunity from jurisdiction which foreign States enjoy in respect of acts performed in the exercise of \nsovereign authority (acta jure imperii).\u2019 Article 27.1, on its turn, provides that certain state agencies that \npossess separate personality and are \u2018capable of suing or being sued\u2019 are not entitled to immunity even if they \nhave been \u2018entrusted with public functions.\u2019 Nevertheless Article 27.2 provides that these state agencies are \nentitled to immunity \u2018in respect of acts performed by the entity in the exercise of sovereign authority (acta \njure imperii).\u2019 See also Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb, The Law of State Immunity (3rd edn, OUP 2013) 118-\n125. \n126 Letelier v Republic of Chile (1980) 488 F Supp 665 (District Court for the District of Columbia) \n<http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/488/665/1400196/> accessed 26 November 2015, \n670-674. \n127 ibid 665-666.  \n128 US Code, Section 1605&lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605> accessed 26 November 2015. \n129 ibid.  \n\n\n\n34  \n\nLetelier could not be understood as a \u2018discretionary act\u2019\u2013\u2013the tort exception, therefore, \n\napplied. In the words of the District Judge Joyce Hens Green,  \n\n \n\u2018[w]hile it seems apparent that a decision calculated to result in injury or death to a particular \n\nindividual or individuals, made for whatever reason, would be one most assuredly involving \n\npolicy judgment and decision and thus exempt as a discretionary act \u2026 there is no discretion to \n\ncommit, or to have one\u2019s officers or agents commit, an illegal act.\u2019130  \n\n \n\nThe District Court also dismissed Chile\u2019s contention that the FSIA applied only in \n\nrespect of acta jure gestionis, stating that the distinction between acta jure imperii and \n\nacta juri gestionis was not incorporated in the FSIA, which was meant \u2018to govern all \n\nclaims of sovereign immunity by foreign states\u2019.131 Lastly, the District Court held that, \n\nalthough the acts undertaken directly by the Republic of Chile were carried out in the \n\nterritory of that country, Chile could not rely on the act of state doctrine because the \n\nactions of its agents resulted in torts committed in the territory of the US\u2013\u2013as put by \n\nDistrict Judge Joyce Hens Green,  \n\n \n\u2018[t]o hold otherwise would totally emasculate the purpose and effectiveness of the Foreign \n\nSovereign Immunities Act by permitting a foreign state to reimpose the so recently supplanted \n\nframework of sovereign immunity as defined prior to the Act \u201cthrough the back door, under the \n\nguise of the act of state doctrine.\u201d\u2019132 \n\n \n\nIt is unclear whether, under international law, states are entitled to immunity in \n\nrespect of all acts jure imperii. In Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, the ICJ avoided \n\nmaking a finding on the matter by restricting the issue submitted to it. The ICJ considered \n\nit had not been called upon to \u2018\u2026 to resolve the question whether there is in customary \n\ninternational law a \u201ctort exception\u201d to State immunity applicable to acta jure imperii in \n\ngeneral\u2019 and that the issue before the Court was confined to \u2018\u2026 acts committed on the \n\nterritory of the forum State by the armed forces of a foreign State, and other organs of \n\nState working in co-operation with those armed forces, in the course of conducting an \n\narmed conflict.\u2019133  \n\n                                                \n130 Letelier v Republic of Chile  (n 126) 673.  \n131 ibid 671. \n132 ibid 674. \n133 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Merits: Judgment) [2012] \nICJ Rep 99, [65]. \n\n\n\n35  \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Sources of the law of state immunity  \n\n \n\nRosanne van Alebeek emphasized that immunity issues arise by definition before \n\ndomestic courts and are a \u2018\u2026 textbook example of domestic courts playing a role in the \n\napplication and development of international law\u2019. 134  As such, the customary and \n\nconventional regimes of state immunity feed on domestic law and domestic court \n\ndecisions. The law of state immunity involves, indeed, an intricate interplay between the \n\ndomestic and the international levels.  \n\nChristopher Schreuer made the following remarks in respect of the heterogeneity of \n\nthe sources of the law of state immunity: \n\n \n\u2018Today, it has become difficult to say whether State immunity is a question of customary \n\ninternational law, of treaty law or of domestic law. But perhaps this is just as well, in order to \n\nremind us that we cannot compartmentalize international legal problems neatly by sources but \n\nhave to take a more synoptic view which takes into account of a variety of types of legal \n\nauthority. \n\n\u2018An obvious irony in this development is the fact that common law countries have found it \n\nnecessary to pass legislation in order to adjust their practice, while the civil law countries have \n\nbeen quite content at developing the law on a case by case basis. This reversal of the traditional \n\npatterns may at least partly be explained by the fact that stare decisis has led the common law \n\njudiciaries into dead ends, from which only formal legislation could free them.\u2019135 \n\n \n\nAs examined in a previous section of this chapter, in a seminal article published by \n\nLauterpacht in 1951, it was proposed the abolition of state immunity, subject to a few \n\nexceptions. Christoph Schreuer remarked that the codifications of the law of state \n\nimmunity followed the opposite approach: \n\n \n\u2018Professor Lauterpacht\u2019s solution would have been generally to do away with State immunity \n\nexcept for a few specific areas of public activity. The more recent attempts at codification have \n\nall adopted the opposite method. They start from a general rule of immunity, which is \n\nsubsequently modified by a list of non-immune activities. \u2026 [T]his technique has undeniable \n\nadvantages over the traditional dichotomy between public and private acts. The idea is to break \n\nup the somewhat unwieldy concept of acta jure gestionis into several categories and thereby \n                                                \n134 Rosanne van Alebeek, \u2018Domestic Courts as Agents of Development of International Immunity Rules\u2019 \n(2013) 26(3) LJIL 559. \n135 Christoph Schreuer, State Immunity: Some Recent Developments (CUP 1995) 4. \n\n\n\n36  \n\nget a more manageable list of non-immune activities.  \u2026 No inferences should be drawn from \n\nthis technique as to the existence of a general rule of international law requiring immunity. \n\nAlso, this method has by no means dropped the old distinction between public and private acts. \n\nIt has merely differentiated and in some areas expanded the area of non-immune activities. For \n\ninstance, the provision in the United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act withdrawing \n\nimmunity in case of expropriation in violation of international law is not a specification but \n\nclearly a deviation from the old distinction.\u2019136 \n\n \n\nIndeed, the main existing codifications (the UNCJISP 2004, the ECSI 1972, the \n\nSIA 1978, and the FSIA 1976) on the law of state immunity adopted a cautious approach. \n\nState immunity is adopted as the general rule and exceptions are laid out. The most \n\nimportant exception in these codifications is the commercial exception, which is a more \n\n\u2018reduced\u2019 and precise version of the distinction between private and public acts.137 As \n\nsummarized by Schreuer,  \n\n \n\u2018[t]he typical exceptions to immunity under this method are commercial transactions \n\nemployment contracts, personal injuries and damage to property, ownership and possession of \n\nproperty, intellectual property, shareholdings in companies, arbitration and ships in \n\ncommercial service.\u2019138 \n\n \n\nThe exception to immunity for torts committed in the territory of the forum state \n\nhas been especially debated given its potential to help address human rights violations that \n\ntook place in the forum state. \n\nThe two international treaties on the law of state immunity were not ratified by \n\nmany states (at the date of the submission of this monograph, the UNCJISP, which is not \n\nyet in force, counts 19 parties and the ECSI, 8). Also, few states have legislations \n\ncontemplating state immunity (eg, the US, the UK, Singapore, Japan, Pakistan, South \n\nAfrica, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Israel).139 This means that most states have to rely on \n\ncustomary international law and the murkiness that comes with it when faced with a \n\nquestion of state immunity. In a comparative study of three European countries (the UK, \n\nGermany and France), Joseph Dellapenna concluded that there is a scenario of \n\nfragmentation: \n\n                                                \n136 Schreuer (n 135) 7. \n137 See Finke (n 91) 858-861.

Likewise, one should not be surprised that \n\nmultinational treaties are no more definitive on the details of state immunity than is state \n\npractice.\u2019140 \n\n \n\nDellapenna\u2019s conclusions are indeed consistent with what one would expect in the \n\nlight of the historical development of the law of state immunity, a process in which \n\ndomestic courts and domestic law had a central role.141  \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Immunity from execution \n\n \n\nSuffice it to say for the purposes of this monograph that immunity from execution \n\nis a separate issue and is governed by different principles and rules than immunity from \n\njurisdiction. The ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State stated that \u2018\u2026 the immunity \n\nfrom enforcement enjoyed by States in regard to their property situated on foreign territory \n\ngoes further than the jurisdictional immunity enjoyed by those same States before foreign \n\ncourts.\u2019142 The ILC\u2019s Commentaries on the Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of \n\nStates and Their Property summarized the subject in the following way: \n\n \n\u2018The practice of States has evidenced several theories in support of immunity from execution \n\nas separate rom and not interconnected with immunity from jurisdiction. Whatever the theories \n\n\u2026 the question of immunity from execution does not arise until after the question of \n\njurisdictional immunity has been decided in the negative and until there is a judgment in favour \n\n                                                \n140 Joseph W. Dellapenna, \u2018Foreign State Immunity in Europe\u2019 (1992) 5 NYILR 51, 61-62.  \n141 See Byers (n 79) 110-111 and Alebeek (n 134). \n142 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 133) [113]. \n\n\n\n38  \n\nof the plaintiff. Immunity from execution may be viewed, therefore, as the last bastion of State \n\nimmunity.\u2019143  \n\n \n\n2.3 The impact of human rights on the law of state immunity \n\n \n\nIt goes without saying that law feeds on societal changes. This was precisely the \n\npremise of one of Wolfgang Friedmann\u2019s major works, ie \u2018\u2026 that the extent of the \n\nstructural changes in international relations in our times requires a far more basic \n\nreorientation of our thinking in international law.\u2019144 What Friedmann had in mind was that \n\nchanges in the nature and in the structure of international society reflected on international \n\nlaw. Friedmann described that parallel to the international law of coexistence, an \n\ninternational law of cooperation had developed. The former aims at the \u2018\u2026 the regulation \n\nof the conditions of mutual diplomatic intercourse and, in particular, of the rules of mutual \n\nrespect for national sovereignty\u2019 145 ; whilst the latter represents \u2018\u2026 [a] move of \n\ninternational society, from an essentially negative code of rules of abstention to positive \n\nrules of co-operation, however fragmentary in the present state of world politics\u2026\u2019, \n\nresulting from the ever growing \u2018range of universal human concerns calling for \n\ninternational regulation\u2019146. Friedmann stressed that the emergence of an international law \n\nof cooperation affected the international law of coexistence, but that it did not mean that \n\nthe international law of coexistence had lost its relevance and validity.  \n\nJoseph Weiler explained the changes undergone by international law through his \n\nmetaphor of the geology of international law. According to him, these changes could be \n\ncaptured by the analysis of the different \u2018layers\u2019 of international law in the same fashion as \n\ngeology folds.147 Weiler stresses that, in contrast to the classical historical method that \n\n                                                \n143 ILC, \u2018Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, with commentaries\u2019 in \n\u2018Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-third session\u2019 (29 April-19 July 1991) \nUN Doc A/46/10 (1991) II(2) YILC 13-62, 56. \n144 Wolfgang Friedmann, The Changing Structure of International Law (Columbia University Press 1964) 3. \n145 ibid 60. \n146 ibid 62. \n147 Joseph Weiler, \u2018The Geology of International Law \u2013 Governance, Democracy and Legitimacy\u2019 (2004) 64 \nZa\u00f6RV 548, 549-550. Weiler further explain his metaphor by describing the \u2018evolution\u2019 of treaty making in \nthe twentieth century:  \n \n\n\u2018In the first decade of the 20th century one discovers a predominance of bilateral, contractual \ntreaties and a very limited number of multilateral law making treaties. One also discovers, in \nthat earlier part of the century, a very sedate, almost \u201cmagisterial\u201d, and backward looking \npractice of customary law \u2026 In mid-century one discovers a huge enterprise of actual and in-\nthe-making multilateral law making treaties ranging from the Law of the Sea to Human Rights \nand even what may be called \u201cconstitutional\u201d treaties. Customary law reincarnates itself into \n\n\n\n39  \n\nprivileges periodization and linearity, geology underscores accretion and the interaction \n\nbetween different strata.148 The geological perspective is a very useful lens through which \n\none can examine the changes undergone by international law. As highlighted by Weiler, \n\n\u2018\u2026 geology allows us to speak not so much about transformations but of layering, of \n\nchange which is part of continuity, of new strata which do not replace earlier ones, but \n\nsimply layer themselves alongside\u2019149. \n\nBeing, according to Friedmann, one of the examples of the law of coexistence, the \n\nlaw of state immunity\u2013\u2013traditionally understood as a corollary of the sovereign equality of \n\nstates\u2013\u2013would be located in the lower strata of international law.150  \n\nIndeed, the principle par in parem non habet imperium has old roots: Bartolus de \n\nSaxoferrato\u2019s Tractatus de regimine civitatis, which dates from the fourteenth century, \n\nmentions it.151 It was employed by him in a different context and only later it would \n\nreceive a different interpretation in the context of the doctrine of state immunity, which \n\ngained proper form and content from the nineteenth century onwards.152 Although it may \n\n                                                                                                                                              \nthe so-called New Sources. \u2026 Towards the end of the century \u2026 one detects the emergence, or \nthickening, of a fourth layer, which has perhaps been less, discussed. This is a regulatory layer. \nIt is notable in the fields of trade with the explosion of Regional Economic Agreements (whose \nnumbers are in the hundred) as well as the new WTO and associated agreements, and in other \nsimilar fields: Environment, Asylum, Finance.\u2019  \n\n \n148 Weiler (n 147) 549. \n149 ibid 551.  \n150 Christian Djeffal also employed the metaphor of the geology of international law to discuss the ICJ\u2019s \njudgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State and the relationship between state immunity and human \nrights. See Christian Djeffal, \u2018Constitutional paths not taken: Germany vs. Italy before the ICJ\u2019 \n<http://verfassungsblog.de/constitutional-paths-germany-italy-icj/> accessed 29 April 2016: \n \n\n\u2018Using Joe Weiler\u2019s metaphor of the geology of international law, one could say that the law of \nstate immunity is rooted deep in the lower layers of public international law where maxims \nlike par in parem non habet imperium of Bartolus de Sassoferato played an important role in \njustifying that one state has no jurisdiction over the other. \n\u2018Have new strata changed the nature of the law on state immunity? \u2026\u2019 \n\n \n151 Stoll (n 1) para 4 and Moursi Badr (n 80) 94.  \n152 As explained by Gamal Moursi Badr (n 80) 94 (footnotes omitted):  \n \n\n\u2018[The maxim par in parem non habet imperium] comes from the pen of the fourteenth century \nItalian jurist Bartolus. Cited in full it reads \u201cNon enim una civitas potest facere legem super \nalteram, quia par in parem non habet imperium\u201d. The mention of civitas would indicate that \nwhat Bartolus had in mind were state-to-state relationships, probably the only kind of a state\u2019s \ntransnational relations which was of any importance in his time. Every state is doubtless the \npeer of every other state at the level of the interaction of supreme political authorities, not to \nsay sovereignties, and no jurisdiction may, or indeed can, be exercised by one state over \nanother at that level. When, however, a state enters into private law relations with individuals \nor corporations in another state, it is no longer acting in the rarefied atmosphere of the \nacephalous pseudo-society of states. \u2026 To say that par in parem non habet imperium and to \nmean thereby that the foreign state should be immune from the jurisdiction of the local courts \n\n\n\n40  \n\nseem to the casual observer that it has frozen, the law of state immunity, to use the \n\nexpression of Sompong Sucharitkul, is a \u2018living reality\u2019.153 At the time Friedmann wrote \n\nhis book, which was first published in 1964, he noted the developments in the law of state \n\nimmunity related to the assumption of new economic responsibilities by states:  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 certain rules, notably those dealing with the immunity of foreign governments from \n\njurisdiction, have been considerably affected by the assumption of governments of economic \n\nresponsibilities not contemplated when these rules were evolved. But the need to qualify the \n\nrule of absolute immunity with respect to commercial enterprises conducted by governments or \n\ngovernmental institutions was first acknowledged by the Belgian Cour de Cassation in 1903. \n\nState ownership and control of commercial enterprises, notably in shipping and other means of \n\ninternational transport, is spread throughout the world and a vast variety of states and political \n\nsystems.\u2019154 \n\n \n\nAccording to Rosalyn Higgins, more recently, transformations in the law of state \n\nimmunity have been caused by developments linked to the changing character of \n\ninternational law from a system providing benefits only for states to a system increasingly \n\nconcerned with the protection of individuals.155 Bruno Simma referred to the movement \n\nfrom the classical, \u2018horizontal\u2019 and bilateral, conception of international law towards a \n\nmore \u2018vertical\u2019 one, driven by community values and more hierarchical and densely \n\ninstitutionalized, ie a movement from \u2018bilateralism to community interest\u2019.156 Important \n\nelements in this regard are the concepts of jus cogens (enshrined in Articles 53, 64, and 71 \n\nof the VCLT) and obligations erga omnes, and Article 103 of the UN Charter. According \n\nto Ant\u00f4nio Augusto Can\u00e7ado Trindade, these elements point towards the construction of an \n\ninternational ordre public and a new jus gentium for the twenty-first century.157 Br\u00f6hmer \n\nsummarized this process in the following way: \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                              \nin respect of those relationships shifts the focus of the problem and ignores its true nature to \nthe detriment of a juridically correct solution.\u2019 \n\n \n153 Sucharitkul (n 3) 257.  \n154 Friedmann (n 144) 61 (footnotes omitted). \n155 Higgins (n 36) 377. \n156 See Bruno Simma, \u2018From Bilateralism to Community Interest in International Law\u2019 (1994) 250 RCADI \n217 and Bruno Simma and Dirk Pulkowski, \u2018Of Planets and the Universe: Self-contained Regimes in \nInternational Law\u2019 (2006) 17(3) EJIL 483. \n157 Ant\u00f4nio Augusto Can\u00e7ado Trindade, \u2018Os rumos do Direito Internacional Contempor\u00e2neo: de um jus inter \ngentes a um novo jus gentium no s\u00e9culo XXI\u2019 in Ant\u00f4nio Augusto Can\u00e7ado Trindade, O direito \ninternacional em um mundo em transforma\u00e7\u00e3o (Renovar 2002), 1081-83. \n\n\n\n41  \n\n\u2018\u2026 international law has developed from a set of rules governing (only) the relationship of \n\nstates to one that attempts to increase the protection of the individual as well, directly by giving \n\nmore weight to human rights and indirectly by establishing rules which are considered \n\nperemptory (jus cogens) and which go beyond the bilateral relations of states to constitute \n\n\u201cobligations erga omnes\u201d, meaning that these \u201care concerns of all states\u201d, and that all states \n\n\u201chave a legal interest in their protection\u201d.\u2019158 \n\n \n\nThe development of the body of human rights law has been remarkable. In the \n\nwell-known formulation of Norberto Bobbio regarding the evolution of the discipline, \n\nbesides the increase in the number of rights deemed worthy of protection and the \n\nemergence of new subjects, individuals started to be perceived in the light of the special \n\ncharacteristics they possess.159 This is why, following the conclusion of the UN Charter in \n\n1945, the adoption of the UDHR in 1948 and of the two International Covenants of 1966 \n\non Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which, \n\ntogether, are the keystones of the international architecture of human rights at the universal \n\nlevel, more human rights treaties were concluded setting up special systems of protection, \n\nwith the scope of safeguarding the rights of specific groups of people, including the 1979 \n\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 1989 \n\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, the 1990 International Convention on the \n\nProtection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the \n\n2007 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Regional developments, like \n\nthe ACHR, the ECHR, and other regional treaties and protocols, went even further with the \n\nestablishment of international tribunals with jurisdiction over cases in which the \n\ncontracting state has breached human rights provisions set out in each system of \n\nprotection. Most notably, Protocol 11 to the ECHR abolished the European Commission of \n                                                \n158 J\u00fcrgen Br\u00f6hmer, State Immunity and the Violation of Human Rights (Martinus Nijhoff 1997) 190 \n(footnotes omitted). \n159 Norberto Bobbio, L\u2019et\u00e0 dei diritti (12nd edn, Einaudi 2014) 61-62:  \n \n\n\u2018Oltre ai processi di positivizzazione, generalizzazione, internazionalizzazione \u2026 si \u00e8 \nmanifestata in questi ultimi anni una nuova linea di tendenza che si pu\u00f2 chiamare di \nspecificazione, consistente nel passaggio graduale ma sempre pi\u00f9 accentuato verso un\u2019ulteriore \ndeterminazione dei soggetti titolari di diritti. \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u2018Cos\u00ec rispetto all\u2019astratto soggetto uomo, che aveva gi\u00e0 trovato una specificazione nel              \n\u00ab cittadino \u00bb (nel senso che al cittadino potevano essere attribuiti diritti ulteriori rispetto \nall\u2019uomo in generale), si \u00e8 fatta valere l\u2019esigenza di rispondere con ulteriore specificazione alla \ndomanda: quale uomo, quale cittadino? \nQuesta specificazione \u00e8 avvenuta sia rispetto al genere, sia rispetto alle varie fasi della vita, sia \ntenendo conto della differenza tra stato normale e stati eccezionali nell\u2019esistenza umana.\u2019 \n\n \n\n\n\n42  \n\nHuman Rights and allowed individuals to bring claims directly to the ECtHR, further \n\nempowering the position of the human being vis-\u00e0-vis the state. Within the framework of \n\nthe Inter-American system, individuals have to petition the Inter-American Commission on \n\nHuman Rights, which may refer the case to the IACtHR. \n\nIn the light of the geological perspective, these phenomena would better be \n\ndescribed as the accretion and thickening of the legislative and constitutional strata of \n\ninternational law. Said strata, as described by Weiler, have as a distinctive feature the \n\nappropriation of common assets, be it material (eg, the deep bed of the high sea) or, in the \n\ncase of the international law of human rights, spiritual.160 The pressures exerted by \u2018the \n\ncommon spiritual asset\u2019 of human rights and jus cogens on the law of state immunity have \n\nbeen felt and have called into question its legitimacy. Ian Brownlie, in 1978, famously \n\ncompared jus cogens to \u2018\u2026 [a] vehicle [that] does not often leave the garage\u2019, adding that \n\n\u2018\u2026 the concept does not seem to have a lot of obvious relevance.\u2019161 Lately, though, said \n\nvehicle has been leaving the garage and bumping into state immunity quite often, as can be \n\ndemonstrated by numerous cases in which there has been an opposition between, on one \n\nhand, state immunity and, on the other, human rights and jus cogens, and by numerous \n\narticles and book chapters that have been published on the subject.  \n\n \n\n2.4 Concluding remarks \n\n \n\nIt is generally accepted that state immunity is required in some cases as a matter of \n\ncustomary international law and that it is now restricted. There have been many different \n\nattempts to reconceptualize state immunity and to provide a more solid theoretical basis for \n\nit, and the foundations of the law of state immunity remain a contentious issue. The \n\nexpansion of the human rights regime is a development that impacted and posed new \n\nchallenges to the traditional domain of the law of state immunity. \n\nIn the following chapter of this monograph, I shall consider how national and \n\ninternational courts dealt with cases relating to state immunity and the protection of human \n\nrights, ie how courts perceived and understood the pressures exerted by human rights on \n\nthe law of state immunity.  \n\n                                                \n160 Weiler (n 147) 556.

Even unjust old \n\nrules, however, have a high degree of compliance pull just because, being old, they are \n\nthought to be like the beams of an old house.

The main goal was to identify the reasoning \n\nprocesses employed to reach the decisions. Although all the cases selected deal with the \n\nsame subject-matter, each court is immersed in a different normative environment. I tried \n\nto be careful not to adopt a quantitative approach in the analyses of the cases, merely \n\ntaking account of the outcomes without doing justice to the peculiarities of each case. It is \n\nimportant to keep in mind that not only technical questions of jurisdiction and applicable \n\n\n\n44  \n\nlaw differ among the courts, but also the environment in which their practices are \n\nembedded. They do not address the same audiences, nor do their concerns necessarily \n\ncoincide.  \n\nThe reference point adopted to structure this chapter was the decision of the ICJ in \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State, due to the authoritativeness, prestige and influence \n\naccorded to its pronouncements. I begin by examining the judgments of domestic courts \n\n(Greece, Italy, Germany, France, Poland, the United States, the United Kingdom and \n\nCanada) and international courts (the ECtHR) rendered before Jurisdictional Immunities of \n\nthe State. The chapter moves next to the decision of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of \n\nthe State, and then to the national (Italy) and international (the ECtHR) decisions rendered \n\nafter it. It ends with a brief assessment of the panorama revealed by the discussions \n\nengaged in by the courts in the various judgments.  \n\nThe judgment of the ICJ was the main guide to select the cases I discuss in this \n\nchapter. Nevertheless, not all cases mentioned by the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of \n\nthe State are individually considered here. Taking as reference this judgment, I tried to \n\nselect a sample of cases that is representative of the main different argumentative patterns, \n\nstrategies and approaches of the legal debate surrounding the relationship between state \n\nimmunity and human rights.1 An article written by Filippo Fontanelli was useful to locate \n\nthe relevant decisions rendered by the Italian Court of Cassation after the judgment of the \n\nICJ.2  \n\nAttention is devoted not only to the final decisions adopted by the courts, but also \n\nto some dissenting and separate opinions which were appended to them. Furthermore, as \n\nregards cases from domestic jurisdictions, emphasis was given to the pronouncements of \n\nthe higher courts of each judicial system. Decisions from lower courts were also included \n\nwhen I had access to them and they were deemed to be significant to the debate (for \n\n                                                \n1 The following references provide an overview of the debate regarding the relationship between state \nimmunity and human rights.

It found that the fact the territory where the \n\nevents took place was occupied by Germany did not affect sovereignty, but meant only \u2018\u2026 \n\na temporary change in the subject exercising sovereignty, namely the occupier, who is \n\nobligated to respect, during the occupation, both the domestic legislation of the occupied \n\nstate \u2026 and the rules of international law \u2026\u20198. In a bold move inspired by the case law of \n\nthe Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, the Multi-Member Court of Levadia found \n\nthat, as regards the relationship between state immunity and jus cogens,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [a]ccording to the prevailing in contemporary theory and practice of international law \n\nopinion, to which this Court also subscribes, it is accepted that the state cannot invoke \n\nimmunity when the act attributed to it has been perpetrated in breach of a ius cogens rule. In \n\nthis case it is also accepted that the defendant state has indirectly waived immunity\u2026\u20199 \n\n \n\nThe Court summarized its understanding in the following way: \n\n \n\u2018a) When a state is in breach of peremptory rules of international law, it cannot lawfully expect \n\nto be granted the right of immunity. Consequently, it is deemed to have tacitly waived such \n\nright (constructive waiver through the operation of international law); b) Acts of the state in \n\nbreach of peremptory international law cannot qualify as sovereign acts of state. In such cases \n\nthe defendant state is not considered as acting within its capacity as sovereign; c) Acts contrary \n\nto peremptory international law are null and void and cannot give rise to lawful rights, such as \n\nimmunity (in application of the general principles ex iniuria ius non oritur); d) the recognition \n\nof immunity for an act contrary to peremptory international law would amount to complicity of \n\nthe national court to the promotion of an act strongly condemned by the international public \n\n                                                \n5 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 137/1997) (n 4) 598. \n6 ibid.  \n7 ibid.  \n8 ibid 599. \n9 ibid. \n\n\n\n47  \n\norder; e) The invocation of immunity for acts committed in breach of a peremptory norm of \n\ninternational law would constitute abuse of right; and finally f) Given that the principle of \n\nterritorial sovereignty, as a fundamental rule of the international legal order, supersedes the \n\nprinciple of immunity, a state in breach of the former when in illegal occupation of foreign \n\nterritory, cannot possible invoke the principle of immunity for acts committed during such \n\nillegal military occupation \u2026 .\u201910 \n\n \n\nThe Multi-Member Court of Levadia concluded that the acts perpetrated by \n\nGermany could not be qualified as sovereign acts because they were allegedly in breach of \n\ninternational peremptory rules\u2013\u2013in particular, the rule enshrined in Article 46 of the \n\nRegulations on the Laws and Customs of War on Land attached to the 1907 Hague IV \n\nConvention, which provides that  \n\n \n\u2018[f]amily honour and rights, the lives of persons, and private property, as well as religious \n\nconvictions and practice, must be respected. \n\n\u2018Private property cannot be confiscated.\u201911 \n\n \n\nThe Court found the suit to be lawful grounded on Article 3 of the 1907 Hague \n\nConvention (IV), according to which \u2018[a] belligerent party which violates the provisions of \n\nthe said Regulations shall, if the case demands, be liable to pay compensation. It shall be \n\nresponsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces.\u201912 Although \n\nGreece had not ratified the 1907 Hague Convention (IV), the Court found that it was \n\nopposable to Germany because its norms were binding on the basis of customary \n\ninternational law.13 \n\n \n\n3.1.1.1.2 Judgment No 11 of the Greek Court of Cassation (Areios Pagos) (2000) \n\n \n\nGermany appealed the decision of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia. The Greek \n\nCourt of Cassation (Areios Pagos) delivered its judgment on 4 May 2000 and the appeal \n\nwas ultimately dismissed by seven votes to four.  \n\n                                                \n10 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (n 4) 599-600. \n11 Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning \nthe Laws and Customs of War on Land (adopted 18 October 1907, entered into force 26 January 1910) \n<http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague04.asp> accessed 26 November 2015. \n12 ibid. \n13 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (n 4) 601.  \n\n\n\n48  \n\nThe Areios Pagos began its decision by recalling Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ \n\nand by referencing the traditional understanding of custom, according to which customary \n\ninternational law is composed of two elements: \u2018constant and uniform\u2019 practice and the \n\nconviction that this practice corresponds to a legal obligation (opinio jure sive \n\nnecessitatis).14 It also recalled Article 28.1 of the Greek Constitution, according to which  \n\n \n\u2018[t]he generally recognised rules of international law, as well as international conventions as of \n\nthe time they are ratified by statute and become operative according to their respective \n\nconditions, shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over any contrary \n\nprovision of the law. The rules of international law and of international conventions shall be \n\napplicable to aliens only under the condition of reciprocity.\u201915 \n\n \n\nBy means of this provision, customary international law is part of the Greek legal \n\norder. Having established the relationship between international law and Greek domestic \n\nlaw, the Areios Pagos proceeded to ascertain customary international law on the subject of \n\nstate immunity. It considered that \u2018sovereign immunity constitutes a consequence of the \n\nsovereignty, independence and equality of nations, whilst its aim is to avoid the \n\ndisturbance of international relations\u201916.  \n\nLike the Multi-Member Court of Levadia, it stated that the international community \n\naccepted the restrictive theory of state immunity and that the distinction between acts jure \n\nimperii and jure gestionis \u2018\u2026 is made on the basis of the law of the forum State and the \n\ncriterion for making this distinction is the nature of the act of the foreign State, meaning \n\nwhether the act itself involves the exercise of sovereign power.\u201917 \n\nThe Areios Pagos went a step further than the Multi-Member Court of Levadia and \n\nexamined what it called the tendency to further limit the immunity of foreign states. To do \n\nso, it firstly examined the ECSI 1972. The low number of ratifications, in the Areios \n\nPagos\u2019 view, should not be understood as a sign there was disagreement on its basic \n\nprinciples.18 The Areios Pagos considered the ECSI a \u2018codifying convention\u201919. Article 11 \n\nof the ECSI, as is known, lays down the tort exception to state immunity.20 \n\n                                                \n14 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) [2003] 129 ILR 513 (Greek \nCourt of Cassation), 515. \n15 The Constitution of Greece\u2014As revised by the parliamentary resolution of May 27th 2008 of the VIIIth \nRevisionary Parliament (Hellenic Parliament\u2019s Publication Department 2008) (translated by Xenophon \nPaparrigopoulos and Stavroula Vassilouni).  \n16 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) (n 14) 516. \n17 ibid. \n18 ibid 517. \n\n\n\n49  \n\nThe tort exception, according to the Areios Pagos, applied irrespective of whether \n\nthe tort was committed by a state acting jure imperii or jure gestionis and was part of \n\ncustomary international law, \u2018\u2026 which, in accordance with Article 28(1) of the \n\nConstitution, constitutes an integral part of national [Greek] law with superior rank.\u201921  \n\nThe Areios Pagos came to this conclusion by ascertaining customary international \n\nlaw in a very conventional fashion. After the reference to Article 11 of the ECSI, it verified \n\nthat the domestic legislations of states that had codified the law of state immunity provided \n\nfor said exception. 22  In the same way, it found that the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles on \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property enshrined in its Article 12 an \n\nexception from immunity with respect to the tortious liability of foreign states.23 The \n\ninterpretative comments attached to the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles added that the exception \n\nproposed did not make a distinction between acta jure imperii and jure gestionis, but noted \n\nthat it was not meant to apply to \u2018situations involving armed conflicts.\u201924 The Areios Pagos \n\nthen mentioned the Resolution adopted by the IDI in 1991 in Basel (\u2018Contemporary \n\nProblems Concerning the Immunity of States in Relation to Questions of Jurisdiction and \n\n                                                                                                                                              \n19 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) (n 14) 517. \n20 European Convention on State Immunity (adopted 16 May 1972, entered into force 11 June 1976) CETS \nNo 74, Article 11:  \n \n\n\u2018A Contracting State cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of another \nContracting State in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to \ntangible property, if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory \nof the State of the forum, and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory \nat the time when those facts occurred.\u2019 \n\n \n21 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) (n 14) 519. \n22 ibid 517:  \n \n\n\u2018Such an exception from immunity is provided for by the legislation of the United States \n(Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976, Article 1605(a)(5)), the United Kingdom \n(Sovereign Immunity Act (SIA) of 1978, Article 5), Canada (SIA of 1982, Article 6), Australia \n(FSIA of 1985, Article 13), South Africa (FSIA of 1981, Article 6) and Singapore (SIA of \n1979, Article 7).\u2019  \n\n \n23 ibid 518.

In any case, the Areios \n\nPagos held the tort exception was not applicable  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 in relation to claims for damages arising [from military action] in situations of armed \n\nconflict, which generally involve conflict between States where harm to civilians necessarily \n\nresults and where resultant claims are normally dealt with through inter-State agreements after \n\nthe war has ended.\u201927  \n\n \n\nIn the next step of the argument, and basing itself on Article 43 of the Regulations \n\non the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of \n\n1907, according to which, in case of military occupation, sovereignty is not transferred to \n\nthe occupying state, which must respect the laws in force in the country, the Areios Pagos \n\nnoted that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the [tort] exception to the immunity rule should apply where the offences for which \n\ncompensation is sought (especially crimes against humanity) did not target civilians generally, \n\nbut specific individuals in a given place who were neither directly nor indirectly connected \n\nwith the military operations. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [E]xtraterritoriality (State immunity) does not cover the criminal acts of the organs of such \n\nan occupying force, where they are committed as an abuse of sovereign power, in retaliation \n\nfor acts of sabotage by resistance groups, against a specific and relatively limited number of \n\ncompletely uninvolved and innocent civilians, something which is anyway contrary to the \n\nprinciple, generally accepted by civilized nations, that no one should be punished for the acts \n\nof someone else\u2026\u201928 \n\n \n\n                                                \n25 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) (n 14) 518.

These cruel murders were \n\nobjectively in any case not necessary for the conservation of the military occupation or to \n\nreduce the resistance action and were carried out on the territory of the State of the forum, by \n\norgans of the Third Reich, in excess of their sovereign powers.\u201929 \n\n \n\nFinally, as a further argument to deny state immunity to Germany, the Areios Pagos \n\nmentioned the argument employed by the Multi-Member Court of Levadia, according to \n\nwhich the breach of jus cogens norms could be understood as a tacit waver of the right of \n\nimmunity.30  \n\n \n\n3.1.1.1.2.1 The dissenting opinions appended to the judgment of the Greek Court of \n\nCassation (Areios Pagos) in Judgment No 11 (2000) \n\n \n\nFive out of the eleven judges of the Areios Pagos appended a dissenting opinion to \n\nthe judgment.  \n\nThe dissenting judges called into question the ascertainment of customary \n\ninternational law by the majority of the Areios Pagos. Firstly, unlike the majority, which \n\ntreated the ECSI as a \u2018codifying Convention\u2019, the dissenting judges took the position that \n\nthe ECSI \u2018\u2026 [did] not constitute in all its provisions a codification of previously \n\nformulated customary international law.\u201931  They highlighted the tort exception to state \n\nimmunity, as embodied in the ECSI, did not apply to torts arising from armed conflicts and \n\nthat the ILC\u2019s Commentaries on the Draft Articles noted Article 12 also did not apply to \n\n\u2018situations involving armed conflicts\u2019. 32 The dissenting judges questioned the use of \n\n                                                \n29 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) (n 14) 520-521. \n30 ibid 521.  \n31 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) (Dissenting Opinions) \n[2003] 129 ILR 513 (Greek Court of Cassation), 521. \n32 ibid 522. \n\n\n\n52  \n\ndomestic law in the process of deducing customary international law\u2013\u2013in their view, the \n\nfact that some states had codified the tort exception to state immunity was of no \n\nconsequence in this respect.33 Consequently, they deemed the decisions of the courts of the \n\nUnited States invoked by the majority to be irrelevant, since they were grounded on \n\ndomestic legislation.34  \n\nThe dissenting judges also pointed out that the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles on \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property and the resolution adopted by the IDI \n\nin 1991 in Basel (\u2018Contemporary Problems Concerning the Immunity of States in Relation \n\nto Questions of Jurisdiction and Enforcement\u2019) could not be used as evidence of a \n\ncustomary norm establishing an exception to state immunity for torts committed jure \n\nimperii in the territory of the forum state\u2014quite to the contrary, they pointed to the lack of \n\nstate consent regarding the subject, since there did not exist at the time a treaty embodying \n\ntheir provisions.35  \n\nThe dissenting judges referenced the Draft Articles on Sovereign Immunity for \n\nAmerican States (1983), which did not extend the tort exception to acta jure imperii.36 \n\nFinally, the dissenting judges indicated the practice of the English courts in I Congresso \n\ndel Partido (1983) and in Kuwait Airways Corporation v. Iraqi Airways (1995) as \n\nexamples in which it was recognized state immunity should be granted with respect to torts \n\ncommitted jure imperii.37  \n\nFour out of the five dissenting judges also disagreed with respect to the majority\u2019s \n\ninterpretation of the armed conflict clause. According to them, the armed conflict clause \n\nshould be applicable to the case, since \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [a]ttempts to break down armed conflicts into different phases, some considered as falling \n\nwithin and some as falling outside the notion of armed conflict, are artificial and do not \n\ncorrespond to reality \u2026 [I]t should be accepted that States enjoy immunity from all claims \n\narising from a situation of general conflict between countries. This interpretation is supported \n\nby the fact that, despite the many recent wars and many atrocities carried out during them, \n\nthere do not appear to have been any successful judicial claims for damages anywhere in the \n\nworld and, in particular, relying on an exception to the rule of immunity.\u201938  \n\n                                                \n33 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) (Dissenting Opinions) (n 31) \n522. \n34 ibid. \n35 ibid. \n36 ibid. \n37 ibid. \n38 ibid 523. \n\n\n\n53  \n\n \n\nThey also added that they disagreed the infringement of a jus cogens norm could be \n\nunderstood as a tacit waiver of the right of immunity, \u2018\u2026 given that there [was] no \n\ncustomary rule establishing that such an infringement [constituted] a tacit waiver of State \n\nimmunity.\u201939 \n\n \n\n3.1.1.2 Judgment of the Greek Special Supreme Court (Anotato Eidiko Dikastirio) in \n\nGermany v Margellos and Others (2002)  \n\n \n\nIn Germany v Margellos and others, the Areios Pagos referred to the Anotato \n\nEidiko Dikastirio (AED) two questions dealing with the issue of state immunity and \n\nindividual claims for torts committed jure imperii in the territory of the forum state: (i) \n\nwhether Article 11 of the ECSI could be qualified as a generally accepted rule of \n\ninternational law; and (ii) whether the exception provided for in said article \u2018\u2026 [covered], \n\naccording to international custom, claims for compensation for torts arising from situations \n\nof armed conflict yet encompassing only certain persons at a certain location having \n\nnothing to do with the armed conflict and not involved in the war activity\u201940.  \n\nArticle 100.1.f of the Greek Constitution gives the AED jurisdiction for \u2018\u2026 [t]he \n\nsettlement of controversies related to the designation of rules of international law as \n\ngenerally acknowledged in accordance with article 28 paragraph 1.\u201941 Article 28.1 of the \n\nGreek Constitution, as referred before, establishes that \u2018[t]he generally recognised rules of \n\ninternational law \u2026 shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over \n\nany contrary provision of the law.\u201942 The AED followed a textbook approach to the \n\nascertainment of customary rules. It referenced Article 38.1 of the ICJ Statute and stated \n\nthat, to conclude whether a rule of customary international law existed, it could use as \n\nevidence  \n\n \n\u2018[i]nternational conventions, records and correspondence of international organizations, the \n\ncase-law of international and domestic courts, state legislation, diplomatic correspondence and \n\n                                                \n39 Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of Germany (Judgment No 11/2000) (Dissenting Opinions) (n 31) \n524. \n40 Federal Republic of Germany v Margellos and Others (Judgment No 6/2002) [2003] 56 RHDI 199 (Greek \nSpecial Supreme Court) (translated by Maria Panezi), 199. \n41 The Constitution of Greece (n 15).  \n42 ibid. \n\n\n\n54  \n\nadvisory opinions of international organizations and States counsel as well as codification \n\nworkings by international organizations, committees and international law institutes\u2026\u2019.43  \n\n \n\nThe AED emphasized that its task was to \u2018\u2026 demonstrate the existence of a rule \n\nwith the complete and specific meaning that this rule has within the international legal \n\norder\u2019 and that \u2018any further power \u2026 to interpret this rule is limited and is exercised in \n\nterms of the aforementioned meaning.\u2019 44  In other words, the AED expressed the \n\nunderstanding that its task was not creative in nature.  \n\nThe AED began the analysis of the legal questions submitted to it by analyzing \n\nArticle 3 45  of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Articles 46 46  and 50 47  of the \n\nRegulations attached to this Convention. Greece was not a party to said treaty, but the \n\nAED accepted the provisions contained therein codified customary international law. The \n\naforementioned Articles read together, according to the AED, established \u2018\u2026 an obligation \n\nfor compensation when acts of the occupying army took place in the territory of that State \n\nin violation of the laws of war upon the population of the occupied belligerent.\u201948 What \n\nwas being discussed, however, was not state responsibility itself. As the AED pointed out, \n\nthe rules enshrined in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and in the Regulations attached to \n\nit did not discipline \u2018\u2026 the means of paying such compensation, nor whether it [would] be \n\npaid following an international agreement or directly to the injured, nor even [regulated] \n\nthe issue of the competent court for the adjudication of such compensation, adjudicating \n\nindividual law-suits by the injured addressed to the State responsible.\u201949  \n\n                                                \n43 Federal Republic of Germany v Margellos and Others (n 40) 200. \n44 ibid. \n45 Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning \nthe Laws and Customs of War on Land (n 11): \n \n\n\u2018Art. 3\u2013\u2013A belligerent party which violates the provisions of the said Regulations shall, if the \ncase demands, be liable to pay compensation.

Ireland and Al-Adsani v. United \n\nKingdom issued on 21 November 2002; the judgment of the International Court of Justice \n\nissued on 14 February 2002; documents of international conventions, such as the \u2026 Basle \n\nConvention and its preparatory workings; the text and preparatory workings of the draft \n\nConvention on State Immunity, adopted by the United Nations International Law Committee in \n\n1991, which has not been adopted as yet; the workings and comments by international law \n\nexperts being reported in the decisions of the International Law Institute in its Conference in \n\nBasle in 1991; legislation of foreign states and mostly the relevant laws of the United States of \n\nAmerica, United Kingdom and the laws of other States with similar content; the case-law of \n\nforeign courts; textbooks, studies and advisory opinions of experts from various States and \n\ntypes of legal order.\u201950  \n\n \n\nThe AED did not undertake a discussion of the international jurisprudence it \n\nmentioned. Following the ECtHR in McElhinney v Ireland, it accepted that there was no \n\nexception for immunity in cases in which the foreign state is being sued for torts \n\ncommitted jure imperii by its organs in the territory of the forum state.51 It also did not \n\nquestion the position taken by the ECHR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom according to \n\nwhich a foreign state has the right to immunity even for acts committed in violation of jus \n\ncogens. In the same manner, it took note of the ICJ judgment in Arrest Warrant, in which \n\nit was upheld that, under customary international law, an incumbent Foreign Minister \n\nenjoyed immunity from criminal jurisdiction even where they are suspected of having \n\ncommitted war crimes and crimes against humanity.52  \n\nThe AED added that, regardless of the cases mentioned, by analyzing the other \n\nsources of law available, it would arrive at the same conclusion, namely \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 that at the present stage of international law development a generally acknowledged rule of \n\ninternational law, that allows, in exemption to immunity, to admissibly bring an action against \n\na State before the courts of another State for compensation from any type of tort that took place \n\nin the territory of the forum and in which the armed forces of the defendant State are involved \n\n                                                \n50 Federal Republic of Germany v Margellos and Others (n 40) 202. \n51 ibid 202. \n52 Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Belgium) (Merits: Judgment) [2002] \nICJ Rep 3, [58].  \n\n\n\n56  \n\nin any way, either in peace or in time of war, has not yet emerged \u2026 the Court reaches the \n\nconclusion that the foreign State is still enjoying the privilege of immunity, when sued for \n\nactions that took place in the territory of the forum and in which its armed forces were in any \n\nway implicated, without a further distinction as to whether these acts violate ius cogens or its \n\narmed forces were or not involved in an armed conflict with other armed parties. \n\n\u2018\u2026 Since a rule that allows for the lifting of immunity in cases of civil responsibility of states \n\nderiving from armed conflicts has been formulated neither in a legal text nor as a fact, it is not \n\nallowed to the Court, as set out in a previous thought, either to formulate such a rule for the \n\nfirst time or to deduce its existence, without invoking specific evidence from international \n\npractice; nor can the Court derive the existence of such a rule by interpreting solely the \n\nprinciple of the State\u2019s obligation to pay compensation in case of breach of the laws of war on \n\nland.\u201953  \n\n \n\nIn the AED\u2019s view, Article 31 of ECSI, according to which no provision of it \u2018\u2026 \n\nshall affect any immunities or privileges enjoyed by a Contracting State in respect of \n\nanything done or omitted to be done by, or in relation to, its armed forces when on the \n\nterritory of another Contracting State\u201954, was justified \u2018\u2026 from the necessity to respect the \n\nsovereignty of the foreign State, the main expression of which are acts carried out by its \n\narmed forces.\u201955  The Court further stressed that respect to sovereignty was \u2018\u2026 the \n\nfoundation of equality between States and consequently of the harmonious international \n\nrelations, which is the goal of all principles of international law.\u201956  \n\nMuch like the ICJ in Arrest Warrant, when it emphasized that the immunity from \n\njurisdiction enjoyed by an incumbent Foreign Minister did not equal impunity in respect of \n\ncrimes they may have committed,57 the AED also underlined that the recognition of \n\nimmunity in favor of a foreign state did not mean the preclusion of the international \n\nresponsibility of the state.58 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n53 Federal Republic of Germany v Margellos and Others (n 40) 203-204.  \n54 European Convention on State Immunity (n 20). \n55 Federal Republic of Germany v Margellos and Others (n 40) 204. \n56 ibid. \n57 Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (n 52) [60]. \n58 Federal Republic of Germany v Margellos and Others (n 40) 204.  \n\n\n\n57  \n\n3.1.1.2.1 The dissenting opinion appended to the judgment of the Greek Special \n\nSupreme Court (Anotato Eidiko Dikastirio) in Germany v Margellos and Others \n\n(2002) \n\n \n\nFour out of the eleven judges of the AED appended a joint dissenting opinion to the \n\njudgment. By examining the same materials, the dissenting judges arrived at the \n\nconclusion it had emerged in international law a rule according to which a state is not \n\nunder an international obligation to grant immunity to a foreign state for torts committed in \n\nthe territory of the forum state by an author present in that territory, regardless of whether \n\nthese torts were committed jure imperii or not.  \n\nThey articulated four arguments in support of their view. Firstly, they argued that \n\nArticle 11 of the ECSI, Article 12 of the ILC\u2019s Draft Convention on State Immunity, \n\nArticle 2.2.e of the Resolution adopted by the IDI in 1991 in Basel (\u2018Contemporary \n\nProblems Concerning the Immunity of States in Relation to Questions of Jurisdiction and \n\nEnforcement\u2019) and Article III of the International Law Association\u2019s Revised Draft \n\nArticles for a Convention on State Immunity all provided for a \u2018tort exception\u2019 clause.59 \n\nSecondly, they pointed out that the same rule could be found in the statutes of states that \n\ncodified the law of state immunity.60 Thirdly, they asserted that their understanding was \n\nbacked up by the ECtHR\u2019s McElhinney case and the Areios Pagos\u2019 judgment in the \n\nDistomo Massacre case. According to the dissenting judges, both the majority and the \n\ndissenting judges in McElhinney recognized \u2018\u2026 sovereign immunity of States does not \n\nprevail over the respective rights of persons both in international law and comparative law \n\nin case of material damages due to an act or omission that took place in the State of the \n\nforum by either the State or persons for which the State is responsible.\u201961   \n\nThe dissenting judges did perhaps a very generous reading of the position taken by \n\nthe majority of the ECtHR, since the ECtHR in McElhinney referred to \u2018a trend in \n\ninternational and comparative law towards limiting State immunity in respect of personal \n\n                                                \n59 Federal Republic of Germany v Margellos and Others (Judgment No 6/2002) (Dissenting Opinions) \n[2003] 56 RHDI 205 (Greek Special Supreme Court) (translated by Maria Panezi), 205. \n60 ibid:  \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 the United States (Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976, Article 1605(a)(5)), \nthe United Kingdom (Sovereign Immunity Act (SIA) of 1978, Article 5), Canada (SIA of \n1982, Article 6), Australia (FSIA of 1985, Article 13), South Africa (FSIA of 1981, Article 6) \nand Singapore (SIA of 1979, Article 7).\u2019 \n\n \n61 ibid 205-206. \n\n\n\n58  \n\ninjury caused by an act or omission within the forum State\u2019 and remarked that \u2018\u2026 this \n\npractice is by no means universal.\u201962 The majority of the ECHR also noted that \u2018\u2026 this \n\ntrend may primarily refer to \u201cinsurable\u201d personal injury\u2019 and that it could not be said that \n\n\u2018\u2026 Ireland is alone in holding that immunity attaches to suits in respect of such torts \n\ncommitted by acta jure imperii or that, in affording this immunity, Ireland falls outside any \n\ncurrently accepted international standards.\u201963  \n\nLastly, the dissenting judges did a different reading of Article 31 of the ECSI, \n\nwhich reinstates the rule of state immunity \u2018\u2026 in respect of anything done or omitted to be \n\ndone by, or in relation to, its armed forces when on the territory of another Contracting \n\nState.\u201964 According to the dissenting judges, this provision \u2018\u2026 refers to the presence of \n\narmed forces of a contracting State in the territory of another contracting State under \n\nregular circumstances tolerated by the latter\u2019, thus it would not include a situation as the \n\none presented to the Court, in which the territory of the forum state was illegally occupied \n\nand war crimes were perpetrated by the armed forces of a foreign state.65 The dissenting \n\njudges added, as a side argument, that war crimes were forbidden by the rules of the 1907 \n\nHague Convention (IV), which, in their view, have the character of jus cogens and created \n\na direct obligation for the responsible state to pay compensation for injured individuals.66   \n\nIn sum, the main argument of the dissenting judges was that the tort exception was \n\na rule of customary international law which could be applied regardless of whether the acts \n\nin question were categorized or not as jure imperii. They also considered it irrelevant that \n\nthe acts discussed were committed by armed forces because they were war crimes and \n\ncould not fall under the meaning of \u2018armed conflict\u2019.67 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n62  McElhinney v Ireland [GC] (Application No 31253/96) (Merits: Judgment) (2001) \n<http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-59887> accessed 26 November 2015, [38].  \n63 ibid. \n64 European Convention on State Immunity (n 20).  \n65 Federal Republic of Germany v Margellos and Others (Judgment No 6/2002) (Dissenting Opinions) (n 59) \n206. \n66 ibid 206-207. \n67 ibid. \n\n\n\n59  \n\n3.1.2 Italy68 \n\n \n\n3.1.2.1 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in Ferrini v Germany (2004) \n\n \n\nOn 23 September 1998, Mr Luigi Ferrini initiated civil proceedings against \n\nGermany before the Tribunale di Arezzo.69 Mr Ferrini demanded reparations due to the \n\ndamages he suffered for having been captured by the German Armed Forces on 4 August \n\n1944 and subsequently deported to Germany, where he was submitted to forced labor until \n\n20 April 1945.70 The Tribunale di Arezzo decided it had no jurisdiction because Germany \n\nhad practiced those acts in its capacity as a sovereign, having as a consequence the right to \n\nimmunity as established in customary international law.71 Mr Ferrini appealed to the Corte \n\nd\u2019appello di Firenze, which confirmed the judgment of the Tribunale di Arezzo. \n\nSubsequently, he appealed to the Court of Cassation.72 \n\nThe Court of Cassation held that there could be no doubt regarding the existence of \n\na norm of customary international providing for an obligation to abstain from exercising \n\njurisdiction over foreign states and that this rule was given effect in the Italian legal system \n\nby virtue of Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution, which establishes that \u2018[l\u2019]ordinamento \n\ngiuridico italiano si conforma alle norme del diritto internazionale generalmente \n\nriconosciute.\u201973 At the same time, the Court recognized the scope of this principle was \n\nbeing progressively restricted.74  \n\nThe Court took the position the acts upon which the claim was based were \n\nundoubtedly an expression of Germany\u2019s \u2018potest\u00e0 d\u2019imperi\u2019. However, in the Court\u2019s view, \n\nthese acts separated this case from others it had considered\u2014due to their \u2018estrema gravit\u00e0\u2019, \n\nthe acts under consideration were \u2018in forza di norme consuetudinarie di diritto \n\n                                                \n68 I had access to the cases of the Italian Court of Cassation through the ILDC database, which publishes not \nonly the original contents of the decisions in full, but also summaries and analyses of the cases written by \nspecialists.

(2002) and what justified a \n\ndifferent treatment for the case at hand. In Marcovic v Presidenza del Consiglio dei \n\nMinistri et al., the Court adjudicated a claim for compensation due to damages suffered as \n\na result of a deliberate air strike by NATO forces in Yugolasvia against the facilities of the \n\nRTS (Radio Television of Serbia), which resulted in the death of relatives of the \n\napplicants. The applicants argued Italy was liable for the damages because, as a member of \n\nNATO, it had taken part in the decision concerning the airstrike and because the actions \n\nhad started in its territory.76 The Court of Cassation declined jurisdiction because, among \n\nother reasons, it considered the choice of a particular way of conducting hostilities was the \n\nmanifestation of a political function against which the situation of an individual\u2019s protected \n\ninterests could not be opposed and therefore it could not be subjected to judicial review: \n\n\u2018alle funzioni di tipo politico non si contrappongono situazioni soggettive protette\u2019.77  \n\nIt is clear Markovic v Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri et al., insofar as it dealt \n\nwith a claim brought against the Italian State before an Italian Court, is not a case dealing \n\nwith state immunity, but with the inadmissibility of judicial review of certain acts \n\nconsidered as political. In Ferrini v Germany, the Court pointed out said inadmissibility is \n\nnot an obstacle to finding a crime has been committed nor to the determination of both \n\ncriminal and civil responsibility.78 It seems, nevertheless, that in Markovic v Presidenza \n\ndel Consiglio dei Ministri et al., the employment of the \u2018political-acts\u2019 doctrine coupled \n\nwith the understanding there was no provision under domestic law of a right to seek \n\nreparation for injuries suffered as a result of the breach of certain international norms had \n\nthis exact effect.79  \n\n                                                \n75 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [7]. \n76 Markovic v Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri e altri (Decision No 8157/2002) (5 June 2002) 85 RDI \n799 (Italian Court of Cassation). \n77 ibid. \n78 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [7.1]. \n79 See Markovic v Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri e altri (Decision No 8157/2002) (n 76): \n \n\n\u2018La scelta di una modalit\u00e0 di conduzione delle ostilit\u00e0 rientra tra gli atti di Governo.  \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u2018Rispetto ad atti di questo tipo nessun giudice ha potere di sindacato circa il modo in cui la \nfunzione \u00e8 stata esercitata. \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u2018Le norme del Protocollo di Ginevra del 1977 (artt. 35.2, 48, 49, 51, 52 e 57) e della \nConvenzione europea dei diritti dell\u2019uomo (artt. 2 e 15.2), che disciplinano la condotta delle \n\n\n\n61  \n\nThe Court also observed that, by virtue of article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution, \n\n\u2018generally recognized\u2019 international norms which protect liberty and human dignity and \n\nconsider as \u2018international crimes\u2019 behaviors that seriously attempt against the integrity of \n\nthese values are \u2018automatically\u2019 part of the Italian legal system and provide a standard \n\nwhereby international and negligent \u2018acts\u2019 may be assessed.80 \n\nThe Court then proceeded to consider the status of deportation and forced labor \n\nunder international law and it found various sources consistently considering it to be an \n\ninternational crimes, thus concluding that it was beyond doubt that, under general \n\ncustomary law binding on all components of the international community, deportation and \n\nforced labor were international crimes. 81  The Court of Cassation added Germany \n\nrecognized the gravity of these crimes by creating, with the assistance of the German \n\ncompanies that benefitted from forced labor, the \u2018Remembrance, Responsibility and \n\nFuture\u2019 Foundation (2000 Federal Law), which has the scope of keeping the memory of \n\nwhat happened and of providing the victims with compensation, as long as they meet the \n\nrequirements established by the law.82  \n\nBefore stating its position, the Court of Cassation established an interesting \n\ndialogue with the decision rendered by the Greek Court of Cassation in the Distomo \n\nMassacre case (4 May 2000). In its decision, the Greek Court of Cassation employed the \n\n\u2018tacit waiver\u2019 theory, according to which, by violating peremptory norms, Germany had \n                                                                                                                                              \n\nostilit\u00e0, hanno bens\u00ec come oggetto la protezione dei civili in caso di attacchi, ma in quanto \nnorme di diritto internazionale regolano rapporti tra Stati. \n\u2018Gli stessi trattati strutturano i procedimenti per accertare le violazioni, prevedono le sanzioni \nin caso di responsabilit\u00e0 (art. 91 del Protocollo; art. 41 della Convenzione), indicano le Corti \ninternazionali competenti ad affermarla. \n\u2018Le leggi che vi hanno dato applicazione nello Stato italiano non contengono per contro norme \nespresse che consentano alle persone offese di chiedere allo Stato riparazione dei danni loro \nderivati dalla violazione delle norme internazionali. \n\u2018Che disposizioni con questo contenuto siano implicitamente risultate introdotte \nnell\u2019ordinamento per effetto della esecuzione data alle norme di diritto internazionale \u00e8 \nprincipio che trova poi ostacolo in quello contrario, di cui si \u00e8 fatto cenno, per cui alle funzioni \ndi tipo politico non si contrappongono situazioni soggettive protette. \n\u2018\u2026.\u2019 \n\n \nSee also the judgment of the ECtHR in respect of this case: Markovic and others v Italy [Grand Chamber] \n(Application No 1398/03) (Merits: Judgment) (2006)&lt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-78623> accessed \n15 May 2016.

The Italian Court of Cassation referred to the following sources: UNGA Resolution 95-I of \n11 December 1946; Article 6.b of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg; a decision \nof the Nuremberg Tribunal of 30 September 1946 noting that this conduct was a violation of Article 52 of the \nConvention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex 1907; the Statute of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Articles 2 and 5); the Statute of the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (Article 3); the Rome Statute of the ICC (Articles 7 and 8). \n82 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [7.3]. \n\n\n\n62  \n\nwaived any benefits accorded by international law. The Court of Cassation did not \n\nconsider this argument persuasive, because, in its understanding, it could not be implied \n\nfrom the serious breaches committed by Germany an intention to waive its jurisdictional \n\nimmunity\u2013\u2013in the words of the Court of Cassation: \u2018\u2026 non vi \u00e8 atto il quale presupponga \n\nnecessariamente una determinata volont\u00e0.

or the victim could bring a civil suit for damage in a \n\nforeign court, which would therefore be asked inter alia to disregard the legal value of the \n\nnational authorising act.\u201991 \n\n \n\nUnlike what was found in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (ECtHR) and Bouzari v \n\nIslamic Republic of Iran (Ontario Superior Court of Justice), the Court of Cassation \n\nopposed the idea immunity had to be recognized insofar as the exception in question to it is \n\nnot specifically provided by a legal norm.92 The Court of Cassation based this reasoning on \n\nthe idea that legal norms cannot be interpreted in a vacuum, separately from one another:  \n\n \n\u2018Il rispetto dei diritti inviolabili della persona umana ha invero assunto, ormai, il valore di \n\nprincipio fondamentale dell\u2019ordinamento internazionale \u2026 [e] l\u2019emersione di tale principio \n\nnon pu\u00f2 non riflettersi sulla portata degli altri principi ai quali tale ordinamento \u00e8 \n\n                                                \n87 ILC, \u2018Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries\u2019 \n(2001) (n 84).  \n88 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [9.1]. \n89 ibid. \n90 ibid. \n91 ibid;

McElhinney, cit. 36). Queste decisioni fanno specifico \n\nriferimento alle norme convenzionali. Ma non vi \u00e8 dubbio che criteri analoghi valgono per \n\nl\u2019interpretazione di quelle consuetudinarie, che, non diversamente dalle altre, sono inserite in \n\nun sistema e possono, pertanto, essere correttamente intese solo se poste in relazione alle altre \n\nnorme che fanno parte integrante dello stesso ordine giuridico (cos\u00ec ad. Es., Dichiarazione \n\nUniversale dei diritti dell\u2019uomo, adottata dall\u2019Assemblea ONU il 10 dicembre 1948, articolo \n\n30).\u201993 \n\n \n\nAs a result of that, and of the status of the respect for inviolable human rights as a \n\nfundamental principle of the international legal system, the Court of Cassation concluded \n\nthis principle impacted upon the scope of other legal principles, such as the principle of \n\nsovereign equality, which is linked to the recognition of state immunity from foreign civil \n\njurisdiction.94 \n\nThe Court of Cassation remarked that in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (ECtHR), in \n\nBouzari v Islamic Republic of Iran (Ontario Supreme Court of Justice), and also in the \n\nopinion of Lord Hutton in Ex parte Pinochet (House of Lords)95, it was contended foreign \n\nstates had the right to jurisdictional immunity with regard to claims for damages derived \n\nfrom the commission of international crimes, but added that these cases had an important \n\ndistinction from the case at hand: they dealt with crimes that were not committed in the \n\nforum state.96 Indeed, these decisions were based on the assumption that any exception for \n\nstate immunity had to be provided for in a specific legal norm, and both the United \n\nKingdom\u2019s SIA 1978 and Canada\u2019s SIA 1985 did not provide for the possibility of \n\nremoving immunity for torts committed outside the forum state. \n\nAs stated before, the Court of Cassation did not share the view only a specific legal \n\nprovision could justify a derogation from state immunity. The Court also noted that the \n\npractice pointed towards the overcoming of the distinction between acta jure imperii and \n\nacta jure gestionis (ie, the restrictive approach to state immunity), as was, in its view, \n                                                \n93 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [9.2] (emphasis added). \n94 ibid.  \n95 Regina v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate and Others, Ex Parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 3) \n[2000] 1 AC 147 (House of Lords). Lord Hutton stated the following: \u2018\u2026 I consider that under international \nlaw Chile is responsible for acts of torture carried out by Senator Pinochet, but could claim state immunity if \nsued for damages for such acts in a court in the United Kingdom.\u2019 \n96 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [10]. \n\n\n\n65  \n\nconfirmed by domestic legislations on the subject, by Article 11 of the ECSI and by Article \n\n12 of the Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property.97  \n\nThe Court of Cassation understood that, for the purposes of tortious liability, the \n\ndistinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis could be no longer considered \n\nas generally applicable.98  \n\nAs a further element to confirm the overcoming of that distinction, the Court of \n\nCassation mentioned the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 1996, which \n\namended the FSIA 1976 of the USA. This amendment added a new exception to the grant \n\nof immunity in cases in which \u2018\u2026 money damages are sought against a foreign state for \n\npersonal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft \n\nsabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an \n\nact\u2026\u2019.99 The derogation provided for by this amendment applies only to states designated \n\nas \u2018sponsors of terrorism\u2019 by the United States. The Court of Cassation considered the \n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 1996 provided a good example of the \n\npriority attributed to the protection of fundamental human rights over the interest of the \n\nstate in having its immunity recognized.100  \n\nThe Court mentioned that, being a corollary of state immunity, the functional \n\nimmunity of foreign state organs could not be invoked for international crimes.101 It \n\nconsidered that this point was undisputed and referred to treaty and domestic case law to \n\nsupport this statement.102 The Court of Cassation reasoned that, if functional immunity \n\n                                                \n97 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [10.1].  \n98 ibid. \n99 US Code, Section 1605A&lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605A> accessed 26 November \n2015. \n100 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [10.2]. \n101 ibid [11]. \n102 ibid:  \n \n\n\u2018\u00c8 ormai pacific che, in presenza di crimini internazionali, l\u2019immunit\u00e0 funzionale degli organi \ndello Stato estero non pu\u00f2 essere invocata. La normativa convenzionale \u00e8, a tale riguardo, in \nequivoca (cos\u00ec, da ultimo, l\u2019articolo 27 dello Statuto della Corte penale internazionale, che \nribadisce un principio gi\u00e0 presente nello Statuto del Tribunale di Norimberga e in quelli del \nTribunale penale per la ex Jugoslavia e per il Ruanda, retro \u00a7 6.3.).

Finally, the Court asserted that, although the facts on \n\nwhich the suit was based occurred in Italy, the \u2018principles of universal jurisdiction\u2019 over \n\ninternational crimes would suffice as a head of jurisdiction.104 The House of Lords in the \n\nJones case discussed the matter and reached the opposite conclusion. \n\n \n\n3.1.2.2 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in Mantelli and Others v Germany \n\n(2008) \n\n \n\nThe decision rendered by the Court of Cassation in Mantelli and Others v Germany \n\nis part of a group of decisions with identical content, which denied immunity to Germany \n\nwith respect to international crimes committed during the Second World War.105 The facts \n\nof this case are similar to those presented before the Court of Cassation in Ferrini v \n\nGermany. After 8 September 1943, Mr Giovanni Mantelli and other Italian citizens were \n\ndeported to Germany, where they were forced to work for German industries.106 The \n\nplaintiffs initiated proceedings seeking compensation against Germany and the company \n\nfor which they were forced to work, Daimlerchrysler.  \n\n                                                \n103 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 69) [11]:  \n \n\n\u2018L\u2019immunit\u00e0 funzionale, secondo l\u2019opinione prevalente, costituisce specificazione di quella che \ncompete agli Stati, poich\u00e9 risponde all\u2019esigenza di impedire che il divieto di convenire in \ngiudizio lo Stato straniero possa essere vanificato agendo nei confronti della persona mediante \nla quale la sua attivit\u00e0 si \u00e8 esternata.

The ILDC database includes a summary and an analysis of Mantelli written by Alessandro \nChechi and Riccardo Pavoni. \n\n\n\n67  \n\nGermany contended Italian courts had no jurisdiction over the claim. It did so \n\nbased on conventional and customary law. Firstly, it argued Italy could not exercise \n\njurisdiction over the matter due to Article 77.4 of the Peace Treaty of 1947, according to \n\nwhich Italy waived \u2018\u2026 on its own behalf and on behalf of Italian nationals all claims \n\nagainst Germany and German nationals outstanding on May 8, 1945, except those arising \n\nout of contracts and other obligations entered into, and rights acquired, before September \n\n1, 1939.\u2019 107  The waiver provided for in this article included \u2018\u2026 debts, all inter-\n\ngovernmental claims in respect of arrangements entered into in the course of the war, and \n\nall claims for loss or damage arising during the war.\u2019108 Forecasting the Court of Cassation \n\nwould deem the Peace Treaty inapplicable, due to Germany not being a party to it, it was \n\nput forward the Bonn Agreement between Germany and Italy concluded on 2 June 1961 \n\nhad settled the matter.  \n\nArticle 1 of the Bonn Agreement established that  \u2018[l]a  Repubblica  Federale  di  \n\nGermania  versa  alla  Repubblica italiana, a definizione delle questioni economiche \n\npendenti, la somma di 40 milioni di marchi tedeschi.\u2019109 According to Article 2.1 of the \n\nsame treaty,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 sono definite tutte le rivendicazioni e richieste della Repubblica italiana, o di persone \n\nfisiche o giuridiche italiane, ancora pendenti nei confronti della Repubblica Federale di \n\nGermania o nei confronti di persone fisiche o giuridiche tedesche, purch\u00e9 derivanti da diritti o \n\nragioni sorti nel periodo tra il 1 settembre 1939 e l\u20198 maggio 1945.\u2019110  \n\n \n\nArticle 2.2 provided that Italy would consider indemnified \u2018\u2026 la Repubblica \n\nFederale di Germania e le persone fisiche e giuridiche tedesche da ogni eventuale azione o \n\naltra pretesa legale da parte di persone fisiche o giuridiche italiane per le rivendicazioni e \n\nrichieste suddette.\u2019111 In other words, the Bonn Agreement was a lump sum agreement by \n\nwhich Germany accepted to pay pecuniary compensation to settle pending claims against \n\nGermany and German natural and legal persons deriving from rights which had emerged \n                                                \n107  Treaty of Peace with Italy (adopted 10 February 1947, entered into force 15 September 1947) \n<https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%2049/v49.pdf> accessed 26 November 2015. \n108 ibid. \n109 Accordo tra la Repubblica italiana e la Repubblica Federale di Germania per il regolamento di alcune \nquestioni di carattere patrimoniale, economico e finanziario con scambi di Note, concluso a Bonn il 2 giugno \n1961 (adopted 2 June 1961, entered into force 16 September 1963)  \n<http://www.normattiva.it/atto/caricaDettaglioAtto?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=1962-08-\n25&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=062U1263&amp;currentPage=1> accessed 26 November 2015. \n110 ibid. \n111 ibid.  \n\n\n\n68  \n\nbetween 11 September 1939 and 8 May 1945. The compensation paid by Germani was \n\nsplit between the victims in accordance with the terms of a Presidential Decree.112 Lastly, \n\nGermany contended the Court of Cassation had erred in law in Ferrini v Germany, insofar \n\nas states enjoyed immunity with regard to acts which are an expression of their \n\nsovereignty.113 Germany grounded this argument on numerous judicial decisions which \n\nwere in contradiction with the ruling of the Court of Cassation in the Ferrini case.114 \n\nThe Court of Cassation asserted the provisions contained in the Peace Treaty of \n\n1947 and in the Bonn Agreement of 1961 referred to substantive rights, and not to \n\njurisdictional issues, and they could not exclude the jurisdiction of Italian judges.115  \n\nThe Court reaffirmed the soundness of its decision in Ferrini v Germany. It \n\nasserted that, whilst the judicial decisions cited by Germany could not confirm support for \n\nthe existence of a \u2018secure and explicit\u2019 customary international norm providing for an \n\nexception to the principle of state immunity for acta jure imperii amounting to \n\ninternational crimes, they also could not support the existence of a customary norm \n\nexpressing the opposite.116 In this sense, the Court emphasized that the joint dissenting \n\nopinion annexed to the judgment of the ECthR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom and that the \n\nobiter dictum of the ECtHR\u2019s decision in Kalogeropoulou and others v Greece and \n\nGermany pointed out that this exception to the principle of state immunity may be in statu \n\n                                                \n112 Decreto del Presidente Della Republica No 2043, 6 ottobre 1963 (\u2018Norme per la ripartizione della somma \nversata dal Governo della Repubblica Federale di Germania, in base all\u2019Accordo di Bonn del 2 giugno 1961, \nper indennizzi a cittadini italiani colpiti da misure di persecuzione nazionalsocialiste\u2019)  \n<http://www.normattiva.it/atto/caricaDettaglioAtto?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=1964-01-\n21&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=063U2043&amp;currentPage=1> accessed 26 November 2015. \n113 Germany v Mantelli and Others (Case No 14201/2008) (n 106) [9]. \n114 ibid [10]:  \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 si richiamano recenti pronunzie di altre corti supreme europee.

It asserted that, in the international legal system, \n\nthe principle of state immunity for acta jure imperii, which has the scope of favoring \n\ninternational relations with respect to each other\u2019s sovereignty, coexists with the principle \n\naccording to which international crimes threaten mankind as whole.118 As stated by the \n\nCourt, deportation and forced labor are undeniably international crimes.119 There is, then, \n\nan antinomy between two competing principles which entered the Italian legal system by \n\nmeans of Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution\u2013\u2013and, at the systematic level, this \n\nantinomy is solved by giving precedence to the higher ranked norm.120 The Court made \n\nthis move conscious that it was acting as an agent of the development of international law \n\nby contributing to the emergence of an international rule already implicit in the \n\ninternational legal system: \n\n \n\u2018[I]nfatti, come gi\u00e0 sottolineato nella sentenza n. 5044 del 2004 [Ferrini] di questa corte, il \n\nrispetto dei diritti inviolabili della persona ha assunto, anche nell\u2019ordinamento internazionale, \n\nil ruolo di principio fondamentale per il suo contenuto assiologico di metavalore \u2026 nel ribadire \n\nora le conclusioni cui sono gi\u00e0 pervenute con il ricordato proprio precedente, queste Sezioni \n\nunite sono consapevoli di contribuire cos\u00ec alla emersione di una regola conformativa della \n\nimmunit\u00e0 dello Stato estero, che si ritiene comunque gi\u00e0 insita nel sistema dell\u2019ordinamento \n\ninternazionale\u2026\u2019121 \n\n \n\nThe Court used as a supporting argument the incongruity that would result in the \n\nlaw by upholding the immunity exception for commercial transactions and at the same \n\ntime not recognizing an exception for international crimes.122 Finally, the Court mentioned \n\nthe fact the wrongful acts were committed in the territory of the forum state as a further \n\nargument to exercise jurisdiction over the matter.123 \n\n  \n\n                                                \n117 Germany v Mantelli and Others (Case No 14201/2008) (n 106) [11]. \n118 ibid. \n119 The Court of Cassation referred to the following sources: Article 6 (b) of the London Agreement of \nAugust 8th 1945; General Assembly Resolution 95-I of 11 December 1946; ILC\u2019s Principles of International \nLaw Recognized in the Charter of the N\u00fcremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal, 1950; the \nStatute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Articles 2 and 5); the Statute of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (Article 3); the Rome Statute of the ICC (articles 7 and 8). \n120 Germany v Mantelli and Others (Case No 14201/2008) (n 106) [11].  \n121 ibid. \n122 ibid. \n123 ibid.  \n\n\n\n70  \n\n3.1.2.3 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in the Milde case (2009) \n\n \n\nOn 29 June 1944, a massacre against civilians took place in the municipalities of \n\nCivitella, Cornia and S.

The Court then focused on justifying logically and \n\nsystematically that the principle of jurisdictional immunity was not absolute and without \n\nexception and that it did not operate when confronted with the customary international \n\nprinciple which legitimizes remedies to obtain compensation for damages caused by \n\ninternational crimes.136 \n\nWhen confronted with the argument espoused by Germany that the decision of the \n\nCourt of Cassation in Ferrini v Germany was isolated and did not correspond to \n\ninternational law, the Court of Cassation took a very interesting approach to the problem: it \n\nasserted that the legal question posed by the relationship between state immunity and jus \n\ncogens could not be solved by a quantitative approach and that the answer to the problem \n\n                                                \n131 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 124) [Svolgimento del Processo]. \n132 ibid. \n133 ibid. \n134 ibid. \n135 ibid [2]. \n136 ibid [4]. \n\n\n\n72  \n\ncould not depend on the number of decisions adhering to one solution or the other.137 The \n\nCourt highlighted that the examination of the practice of tribunals was important to \n\nascertain customary international law, but that there were other elements to be taken into \n\naccount:  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 il punto che soprattutto preme di sottolineare \u00e8 intimamente collegato alla convinzione che \n\nla soluzione della questione dibattuta non possa corrispondere ad un esito di tipo meramente \n\nquantitativo e non possa dipendere, perci\u00f2, soltanto dal numero, maggiore o minore, delle \n\ndecisioni che aderiscono all\u2019una o all\u2019altra posizione. \u2026 se \u00e8 vera che l\u2019esame della prassi dei \n\ntribunali dei vari Stati costituisce uno strumento importante per l\u2019accertamento del vigore delle \n\nnorme consuetudinarie di diritto internazionale, \u00e8 non di meno certo che il compito \n\ndell\u2019interprete non pu\u00f2 ridursi ad un computo aritmetico dei dati desunti dalla prassi, dovendo \n\ntenersi conto, oltre che delle difficolt\u00e0 di verifica della reale esistenza delle consuetudini, anche \n\ndella consistenza qualitativa di esse, delle interrelazioni riscontrabili tra le stesse, \n\ndell\u2019operativit\u00e0 dei nessi di interdipendenza e di collocazione gerarchica operanti in diretta \n\nfunzione del rango attribuito a ciascuna di quelle norme rispetto alla scala dei valori \n\ngeneralmente accolta dall\u2019ordinamento internazionale.\u2019138 \n\n \n\nEchoing Ferrini, the Court of Cassation asserted that it could only provide a \n\nsolution to the legal problem before it by coordinating the coexisting customary \n\ninternational norms in question and assessing whether their respective spheres of \n\napplication were compatible or if one norm should prevail over the other: on one side, the \n\nprinciple of the jurisdictional immunity of states recognized with respect to acta jure \n\nimperii; on the other, the customary rules protecting fundamental human rights, which also \n\nwere codified in numerous treaties.139  \n\nThe next step of the judgment is perhaps the most important: the Court \n\nacknowledged that \u2018\u2026 [i]l coordinamento non pu\u00f2 che essere realizzato sulla base di \n\ngiudizi di valore che risultino in perfetta sintonia con le opzioni accolte nell\u2019ordinamento \n\ninternazionale.\u2019140 In other words, the Court stated it was necessary to make a value-\n\noriented choice in consonance with the option embodied in international law. And in the \n\nCourt of Cassation\u2019s view, this option was to give precedence to the hierarchically superior \n\nprinciples. 141  Given the \u2018parallela e antinomica coesistenza nell\u2019ordinamento \n\n                                                \n137 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 124) [4]. \n138 ibid (emphasis added).  \n139 ibid [5]. \n140 ibid [6]. \n141 ibid. \n\n\n\n73  \n\ninternazionale dei due principi, entrambi di portata generale\u2019, it was necessary to solve this \n\nconflict \u2018sul piano sistematico del coordinamento e sulla base del criterio del \n\nbilanciamento degli interessi, dandosi prevalenza al principio di rango pi\u00f9 elevato e di ius \n\ncogens, quindi alla garanzia che non resteranno impuniti i pi\u00f9 gravi crimini dei diritti \n\ninviolabili di libert\u00e0 e dignit\u00e0 della persona umana.\u2019142 The Court remembered there was a \n\n\u2018qualitative difference\u2019 between customary international norms: customary principles on \n\njurisdictional immunity, remembered the Court, admit derogation by conventional norms, \n\nwhilst customary norms safeguarding inviolable human rights have the nature of jus \n\ncogens and do not admit derogation.143 The Court added Article 53 of the VCLT postulated \n\nunequivocally the pre-eminence of jus cogens norms.  \n\nThe Court of Cassation concluded that, on the systematic level, precedence should \n\nbe given to the norms belonging to jus cogens since they have a hierarchically higher rank \n\nin the international legal system.144  \n\nThe Court of Cassation then proceeded to analyze the issue on the logical level. It \n\nconsidered that the norms protecting freedom and human dignity were founded on \n\n\u2018principi universali ed inderogabili, percepiti come tali dall\u2019intera comunit\u00e0 \n\ninternazionale\u2019 145  and that the internal coherence of the international legal system \n\ndemanded a reaction to the breach of these rules: it would not make sense to proclaim their \n\nprimacy and at the same time to deprive individuals from the right of access to court, \n\nwhich provides the means to guarantee the effectiveness and preeminence of fundamental \n\nrights.146  \n\nThe Court of Cassation added an argument concerning the reception of customary \n\ninternational law in the domestic legal system that would be later developed in Judgment \n\nNo 238/2014. Although the Court conceded the hierarchical status of international norms \n\nincorporated in the domestic legal order by means of Article 10.1 of the Italian constitution \n\nwas still a controversial issue, the Court argued that even the authors who considered these \n\nnorms enjoyed the same rank as constitutional law agreed that this reception could only \n\noperate provided that the international norms in question were in accordance with the \n\n                                                \n142 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 124) [6]. \n143 ibid.  \n144 ibid. \n145 ibid [7]. \n146 ibid.  \n\n\n\n74  \n\nconstitutional principles considered to be non-derogable, which comprise, of course, \n\nfundamental human rights.147 \n\nFinally, the Court of Cassation addressed the argument that Italy would be in \n\nbreach of its treaty obligations if it exercised jurisdiction over the claim in question. The \n\nCourt of Cassation asserted the Peace Treaty of 1947 could not be invoked because \n\nGermany was not a party to it and because the relevant provision of this treaty, Article \n\n77.4, only refers to rights related to material damages (\u2018diritti di natura reale relativi a \n\ndanni materiali\u2019), and not to moral damages. 148  The Court decided that the Bonn \n\nAgreement between Germany and Italy concluded on 2 June 1961 was not applicable to \n\nthe situation at hand because, in its interpretation, Article 2 of the treaty circumscribed its \n\nscope to claims pending on the date the treaty was concluded, and not to claims that had \n\nnot been started at the time the Bonn Agreement was concluded between the two states.149 \n\nAlso, the Court considered that the Bonn Agreement did not include moral damages \n\n(\u2018danni morali cagionati da crimini internazionali commessi attraverso la grave lesione dei \n\ndiritti inviolabili dell\u2019uomo\u2019).150 \n\n \n\n3.1.2.4 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia \n\n(2011) \n\n \n\nThis is, to my knowledge, the last pronouncement of the Italian Court of Cassation \n\non the issue of state immunity and grave violations of international human rights law and \n\ninternational humanitarian law before the judgment of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities \n\nof the State.  \n\nThis judgment has a direct link with the judgment of the Multi-Member Court of \n\nLevadia in the Distomo massacre case. As previously analyzed, the Greek Court of \n\nCassation confirmed the decision of the Court of Levadia. The complainants \n\nunsuccessfully tried to enforce these decisions in Greece\u2013\u2013Article 923 of the Greek Code \n\n                                                \n147 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 124) [7]. \n148 ibid [8]. \n149 ibid: \n \n\n\u2018Pertanto, va riconosciuto che \u00e8 munita di solida base giustificativa l\u2019opinione accolta nella \nsentenza impugnata secondo cui \u00e8 da escludere che possa applicarsi l\u2019Accordo del 1961 ad una \ncontroversia, come quella dedotta nel presente processo, non ancora pendente, perch\u00e9 neppure \niniziata alla data di stipulazione della convenzione tra i due Stati \u2026\u2019 \n\n \n150 ibid. \n\n\n\n75  \n\nof Civil Procedure prescribes that the enforcement of decisions against foreign states is \n\nsubject to the prior consent of the Minister of Justice, which the complainants did not \n\nobtain. This refusal of the Greek courts to grant enforcement was questioned before the \n\nECtHR in Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany. Furthermore, the \n\ncomplainants sought to have the judgments enforced in Germany, but they were \n\nunsuccessful before both the German Federal Court of Justice and before the German \n\nConstitutional Court. \n\nIn Italy, however, the Court of Appeal of Florence, in Judgment No 1696/2008, \n\ndeclared enforceable the decision of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia to pay \n\ncompensation to the Prefecture of Vojotia, which was the legal representative of the \n\nvictims.151  \n\nGermany challenged this decision before the Court of Cassation, which rendered \n\njudgment on 20 May 2011. The Court of Cassation rejected Germany\u2019s request to stay \n\nproceedings pending the ICJ\u2019s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State on the \n\ngrounds that the proceedings before the ICJ concerned the relations between states152. \n\nAccordingly, the Court of Cassation reasoned that, if Italy eventually had to give effect to \n\nthe judgment of the ICJ, it would have to do so by adopting legislative and administrative \n\nmeasures\u2013\u2013in the absence of such measures, the right of action of individuals who \n\nobtained a judgment enforceable in Italy remained intact.153 \n\nOut of the seven grounds of appeal raised by Germany, only one related to \n\ninternational law, which was meticulously examined by the Court of Cassation. The \n\nground of appeal in question was based on Article 64.1.g of Law No 218/1995 (\u2018Riforma \n\ndel sistema italiano di diritto internazionale private\u2019)154 and on Article 34.1 of Council \n\nRegulation No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments \n\n                                                \n151 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (20 May 2011) ILDC 1815 (Italian Court of \nCassation),  [1]-[2].

Insofar as, by means of Article 10.1 of the Italian \n\nConstitution, \u2018[l]\u2019ordinamento giuridico italiano si conforma alle norme del diritto \n\ninternazionale generalmente riconosciute\u2019, Germany contended that the enforcement of the \n\njudgments of the Greek courts in question would amount to a violation of the principle of \n\npublic policy.156 \n\nThe Court of Cassation took this opportunity to reaffirm the case-law it developed \n\nin Ferrini, Milde and Mantelli and to frame it in a theoretical account of the law of state \n\nimmunity.  \n\nThe Court began by recalling the hierarchical argument it had employed in Ferrini: \n\nthe international crimes committed violated rights from which no derogation is permitted. \n\nGiven the existence of an antinomy between the international norms protecting those rights \n\nand those relating to state immunity, priority has to be accorded to the norms of higher \n\nrank\u2014in the words of the Court of Cassation: \u2018[i]t follows from this hierarchical \n\nrelationship that the immunity States enjoy with regard to their acts jure imperii \u2026 is not \n\nan absolute immunity but rather an immunity conditional on the respect for norms that \n\nprotect human rights.\u2019157  \n\nThe Court of Cassation then referred to one of the arguments employed in Mantelli, \n\nwhich was part of a group of decisions (Orders 14201/2008 to 14213/2008) with identical \n\ncontent. In Mantelli, the Court of Cassation considered that human rights protection has the \n\nrole of a fundamental principle due to its \u2018axiological content of  \u201cmeta-value\u201d\u2019 and that, \n\nby giving priority to this principle when confronted with the principle of jurisdictional \n\nimmunity of states, it was self-consciously contributing to the emergence of a \u2018formative \n\n                                                \n155 Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and \nenforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters  \n<http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R0044:en:HTML> accessed 26 \nNovember 2015: \n \n\n\u2018Article 34\u2013\u2013A judgment shall not be recognised: 1. if such recognition is manifestly contrary \nto public policy in the Member State in which recognition is sought \u2026\u2019 \n\n \n156 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (n 151) [27]. \n157 ibid [29]. \n\n\n\n77  \n\nrule concerning state immunity\u2019 which was \u2018already implicit in the international legal \n\nsystem\u2019.158  \n\nThe Court of Cassation then sought to demonstrate that Germany erred when it \n\ncontended that the Court of Cassation was isolated in respect of its approach. Germany \n\nreferred to the Jones case, in which the House of Lords emphatically criticized the Ferrini \n\njudgment. In the House of Lords, Lord Bingham expressed its disapproval with the \n\ncontention that the principle of universal jurisdiction was applicable to civil actions arising \n\nfrom international crimes. The Court of Cassation tried to dismiss this criticism by stating \n\nthat  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the 2006 judgment of the House of Lords [the Jones case] \u2026 relied on the principle of \n\nlocus commissi delicti, and they opposed the part of the Ferrini judgment which referred to the \n\nuniversal character of jurisdiction in cases relating to the protection of inviolable rights of the \n\nperson\u2026 [T]he references in Ferrini to the literature on universal jurisdiction (and to the non-\n\napplicability of statutes of limitations) are made merely to corroborate the greater importance, \n\nin the international context, of the protection of inviolable rights as compared to State \n\nimmunity. \u2026 [W]hen the limiting principle of locus commissi delicti is taken into account, the \n\nFerrini judgment is by no means out of step with the international jurisprudence. \u2026 [W]e \n\ndecline to attribute to the Ferrini judgment a meaning which\u2014if the specific circumstances of \n\nthat case are taken into account\u2014it plainly does not have, namely, that it upholds the principle \n\nof universal jurisdiction to decide human rights cases and gives priority to that principle over \n\nthe customary principle of State immunity.\u2019159 \n\n \n\nThe Court of Cassation did not address, however, Lord Hoffmann\u2019s critique that \n\nthe ordering of competing principles was a technique of adjudication unacceptable in \n\ninternational law.  \n\nIn Ferrini the Court of Cassation criticized the \u2018tacit waiver\u2019 theory, which was \n\nemployed by the Multi-Member Court of Levadia (and mentioned by the Areios Pagos), on \n\nthe grounds that it could not be implied from the violations of peremptory norms by \n\nGermany its intent to waive its jurisdictional immunity. In this judgment, the Court of \n\nCassation merely mentioned that  \n\n \n\n                                                \n158 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (n 151) [30]. \n159 ibid [32]-[33]. \n\n\n\n78  \n\n\u2018the tribunal [of Levadia] made explicit reference to the prevalence, in legal literature and in \n\ninternational practice, of the opinion according to which a State is precluded from invoking \n\nimmunity where the act imputed to it violates a rule of jus cogens.\u2019160 \n\n \n\nContinuing its analysis, the Court of Cassation closed examined two cases decided \n\nby US Courts: Letelier v Republic of Chile (1980) and Liu v Republic of China (1989). The \n\nLetelier and Liu cases dealt with political assassinations committed in the territory of the \n\nUnited States by agents of foreign states. In both cases, the \u2018tort exception\u2019 to state \n\nimmunity enshrined in the FSIA was applied. The FSIA did not incorporate the distinction \n\nbetween acta jure imperii and jure gestionis, which was immaterial to the outcome of the \n\ncases. In the Letelier case, the District Court found that, for the purposes of Section \n\n1605.a.5.A, according to which the tort exception is not applicable to \u2018any claim based \n\nupon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary \n\nfunction regardless of whether the discretion be abused\u2019161, the order of the Chilean \n\nRepublic for its organs to perpetrate the conducts that culminated in the assassination of \n\nOrlando Letelier could not be understood as a \u2018discretionary act\u2019\u2014the \u2018tort exception\u2019, \n\ntherefore, applied. The same understanding was applied in the Liu case. According to the \n\nCourt of Cassation, the Letelier case was important because \u2018it [highlighted] the \n\ninadequacy of the theory of acts jure imperii as a means to resolve the issue of immunity in \n\ncases of violations of important norms such as those protecting human rights.\u2019162 \n\nThe Court of Cassation also referred to Altmann v Republic of Austria (2004), in \n\nwhich the US Supreme Court detailed the historical background of the codification of the \n\nFSIA.163 The Court of Cassation underlined the Altmann case showed that,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 in American common law, the principle of State immunity had an \u201cinternal\u201d origin, since, \n\nbefore the enactment of the FSIA, it was applied in a case-by-case basis and consistency often \n\ngave way to political considerations.164    \n\n \n\n                                                \n160 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (n 151) [35]. \n161 US Code, Section 1605&lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605> accessed 26 November 2015. \n162 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (n 151) [37]; Letelier v Republic of Chile (1980) \n488 F Supp 665 (District Court for the District of Columbia) and Liu v Republic of China (1986) 642 F Supp \n297 (District Court for the Northern District of California). \n163 Republic of Austria v Altmann (2004) (03-13) 541 US 677; 327 F.3d 1246 (Supreme Court of the United \nStates)&lt;www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-13.ZO.html> accessed 10 November 2015.  \n164 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (n 151) [39]. \n\n\n\n79  \n\nIn the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ considered that \u2018\u2026 in customary international \n\nlaw, the immunities accorded to Ministers for Foreign Affairs are not granted for their \n\npersonal benefit, but to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of \n\ntheir respective States.\u2019165 After an examination of the functions exercised by Foreign \n\nMinisters, the ICJ concluded that \u2018\u2026 the functions of a Minister for Foreign Affairs are \n\nsuch that, throughout the duration of his or her office, he or she when abroad enjoys full \n\nimmunity from criminal jurisdiction and inviolability.\u2019166 The Court of Cassation inferred \n\nthat these considerations of the ICJ were made pursuant certain theoretical premises. \n\nAccording to the Court of Cassation, the ICJ adopted a view of immunity that differed \n\nfrom the conception according to which immunity is founded on the principle of sovereign \n\nequality of states: \n\n \n\u2018According to the Court [the ICJ], an international customary rule required immunity for \n\nForeign Ministers to ensure the effective fulfillment of their duties and to protect them from \n\nany act by another State that could impair the performance of their tasks. In essence, such a \n\nnorm precluding the exercise of jurisdiction made it possible to discharge duties that promote \n\nthe reciprocal interests of States and the interests of the Community of nations. This definition \n\nof the international customary norm expresses a conception of immunity altogether different \n\nfrom the notion of a dichotomy between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis, the latter \n\nvision being linked to a principle of equality among States, according to the maxim of par in \n\nparem non habet imperium. The theories that justify immunity on the basis of the principle of \n\nequality among States envisage an absolute shield of immunity which in reality \u2026 never \n\nexisted. This absolute vision is an abstract one that depicts the international space as a space \n\nthat is empty, rather than as one of cooperation. But in recent decades, we have witnessed an \n\never-advancing construction of supranational norms designed to respect and protect human \n\nrights.\u2019167 \n\n \n\nIn my view, it is very doubtful that, underlying the ICJ\u2019s argument, there was a \n\nrejection of the theory that links state immunity and the principle of sovereign equality of \n\nstates. In any case, ten years later, in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, the ICJ stated \n\nthat \u2018the rule of State immunity \u2026 derives from the principle of sovereign equality of \n\nStates\u2019. 168  Nevertheless, the Court of Cassation\u2019s efforts to develop a theoretical \n\n                                                \n165 Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (n 52) [53]. \n166 ibid [54]. \n167 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (n 151) [40]. \n168 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Merits: Judgment) [2012] \nICJ Rep 99, [57]. \n\n\n\n80  \n\nframework to support its case-law are notable. In the Court of Cassation\u2019s view, state \n\nimmunity is not founded on the principle of sovereign equality of states\u2014it is \u2018functional\u2019 \n\nbecause it is accorded to \u2018promote the reciprocal interests of States and the interests of the \n\nCommunity of nations\u2019.  \n\nAnother point added by the Court of Cassation was that the UNCJISP and the ECSI \n\nwere not relevant to the dispute, since they do not take into account situations in which a \n\nstate practiced acts in violation of jus cogens norms.169 \n\nLastly, the Court of Cassation made a more general argument as regards the current \n\nstate of international law by highlighting three developments in the post-Second World \n\nWar international legal order: (i) the impact of the UN and the establishment of \n\ninternational ad hoc criminal tribunals and of the ICC; (ii) the continuous process of \n\nEuropean integration and the creation of the ECtHR; and (iii) the rise of democratic \n\nregimes, specifically in Europe. 170  The Court of Cassation highlighted the Italian \n\nconstitution was \u2018\u2026 designed to fully implement the new order within the national \n\nterritory\u2019.171  \n\nAs a result, the Court of Cassation held that the execution in Italy of the relevant \n\nGreek judgments could not be considered to be in violation of the Italian public order: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 it must therefore be excluded that the execution in Italy of a judgment of a foreign State, \n\nwhich requires a third State (each of these States, in this case, being a signatory to the \n\nEuropean Convention of Human Rights and a member of the European Union) to compensate \n\nvictims (and their heirs) of very serious war crimes\u2014denied of their inviolable rights, \n\nincluding above all the right to life\u2014can be held contrary to the Italian public order under \n\nArticle 64(1)(g) of Law 218/1995.\u2019172 \n\n \n\n3.1.3 Germany  \n\n \n\nThe judicial decisions discussed here also have a link with the Distomo Massacre \n\ncase. The claimants in that case (previously discussed in this chapter) initiated parallel \n\nproceedings before the German courts seeking a declaration of Germany\u2019s liability in \n\n                                                \n169 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (n 151) [47]. \n170 ibid [48]. \n171 ibid [49]. \n172 ibid. \n\n\n\n81  \n\ndamages in respect of those events.173 Their claim was dismissed by the Oberlandesgericht \n\n(OLG) (Regional Court) of Cologne.174 They appealed to the Federal Supreme Court.175 \n\nOn appeal, the claimants asked for recognition and enforcement of Judgment No 137/1997 \n\nrendered by the Multi-Member Court of Levadia. The Federal Supreme Court asserted that \n\nthere would be legal basis to recognize the judgment of the Multi-Member Court of \n\nLevadia only if it had been rendered \u2018within the jurisdiction of the Greek State\u2019.176 This \n\nrequirement, however, was not met in the view of the Federal Supreme Court, which found \n\nthat Greece did not have international jurisdiction over the claims. According to the \n\nFederal Supreme Court, the acts of German forces in the occupied Greek territory were of \n\na sovereign nature and, under international law, immunity is available for acta jure \n\nimperii.177 The Federal Supreme Court added that the attempt to restrict immunity in \n\nrespect of violations of jus cogens was not accepted by the majoritarian view.178 The \n\nFederal Supreme Court also did not accept the tort exception could be used to lift \n\nGermany\u2019s jurisdiction.179 The Federal Supreme Court highlighted the tort exception was \n\nprovided for in Article 11 of the ECSI, Article 31 of which excludes acts of armed forces \n\nfrom the scope of the convention. The Federal Supreme Court added it was questionable \n\nwhether the tort exception was an expression of a rule of customary international law and, \n\nassuming it were, it could not have retroactive effect reaching the events of the Second \n\nWorld War.180 As a further argument, the Federal Supreme Court mentioned the judgment \n\nof the Greek Special Supreme Court in Germany v Margellos and the ECtHR\u2019s judgment \n\nin Kalogeropoulou confirmed this interpretation of international law.181 The other part of \n\nthe judgment concerned the claim for damages and compensation itself and is not relevant \n\nfor the purposes of this monograph, since it deals with Germany\u2019s liability, and not with \n\nstate immunity.  \n\nAn appeal was lodged before the Federal Constitutional Court, which held that the \n\nrefusal of the Federal Supreme Court to recognize Judgment No 137/1997 of the Multi-\n\nMember Court of Levadia did not violate Germany\u2019s Constitution:  \n\n                                                \n173 Greek Citizens v Federal Republic of Germany (Case No III ZR 245/98) [2007] 129 ILR 556 (Federal \nSupreme Court), 557. \n174 ibid 558. \n175 ibid. \n176 ibid 559. \n177 ibid 559-560. \n178 ibid 560. \n179 ibid. \n180 ibid 560-561. \n181 ibid 561-562. \n\n\n\n82  \n\n \n\u2018The refusal of the Bundesgerichtshof [the Federal Supreme Court] to be bound by the \n\njudgment of the court in Livadia of 30 October 1997 is not objectionable under the \n\nConstitution. Under current international law, a State may claim exemption from the \n\njurisdiction of another State if and in so far as an appraisal of its sovereign conduct is \n\nconcerned\u2014so called acta jure imperii \u2026 As the SS unit that took part in the events in \n\nDistomo was incorporated into the armed forces of the German Reich, the attacks, irrespective \n\nof the question of their infringement of international law, are to be classed as sovereign acts. \n\nThe Bundesgerichtshof therefore correctly held it was not bound by the judgment of the Greek \n\ncourt in Livadia.\u2019182  \n\n \n\n3.1.4 France   \n\n \n\nThe French Court of Cassation has consistently held that Germany is entitled to \n\nimmunity in proceedings brought by French citizens seeking damages for injuries suffered \n\nas a result of deportation to Germany and forced labor during the Second World War. The \n\nFrench Court of Cassation has justified the grant of immunity due to the jure imperii nature \n\nof the acts perpetrated by the Third Reich.183  \n\nIn GIE La R\u00e9union A\u00e9rienne v La Jamahiriya Arabe Libyenne184, the French Court \n\nof Cassation had to pronounce itself on whether Libya was entitled to state immunity. The \n\ncase was related to the explosion, on 19 September 1989, of an aircraft of the French \n\nAirline UTA, which was operating a flight from Brazzaville to Paris.185 The event, which \n\nled to the death of 170 people, was the result of a bomb planted in the aircraft. Six Libyan \n\nnationals were held civilly and criminally liable in absentia (\u2018par contumace\u2019) for it by the \n\nCour d\u2019assises de Paris. 186  In another proceeding, other beneficiaries of the victims \n\npursued claims against the six Libyan nationals who had been found liable by the Cour \n\n                                                \n182 Greek Citizens v Federal Republic of Germany (Case No 2 BvR 1476/03) [2009] 135 ILR 186 (Federal \nConstitutional Court), 191-192. \n183  See the following cases: Bucheron (Case No 02-45.961) (16 December 2003) \n<http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007047249> accessed 26 \nNovember 2015; X (Case No 03-41.851) (2 June 2004) (Cour de Cassation, Chambre Civile 1) \n<http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007048876> accessed 26 \nNovember 2015 (Cour de Cassation, Chambre Civile 1); Grosz (Case No 04-47504) (3 January 2006) \n<http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007494943> accessed 26 \nNovember 2015 (Cour de Cassation, Chambre Civile 1).  \n184 GIE La R\u00e9union A\u00e9rienne v La Jamahiriya Arabe Libyenne (Case No 09-14743) (9 March 2011) \n<http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?oldAction=rechJuriJudi&amp;idTexte=JURITEXT0000236940\n14&amp;fastReqId=918656892&amp;fastPos=1> accessed 26 November 2015.  \n185 ibid. \n186 ibid. \n\n\n\n83  \n\nd\u2019assises de Paris, the Libyan state and the Fonds de garantie des victimes des actes de \n\nterrorisme et d\u2019autres infractions.187 The GIE La R\u00e9union A\u00e9rienne and other entities that \n\nhad sold insurance policies to the French Airline UTA voluntarily intervened in the \n\nproceedings before the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris.188 They asked the Tribunal to \n\ncondemn the six Libyan nationals and the Libyan state to reimburse the indemnities \n\nallocated.189 The Tribunal de grande instance de Paris declared Libya was entitled to \n\nimmunity\u2014except as regards the French claimants vis-\u00e0-vis which the foreign state had \n\nrenounced its right to immunity.190  \n\nThe French Court of Cassation upheld the grant of immunity. The French Court of \n\nCassation highlighted Libya had not committed the acts of terrorism\u2014its responsibility \n\nwas called into question because it had allegedly failed to repress and to disavow them, \n\nand allegedly had even approved and supported them.191 The Court of Cassation quoted \n\nwith approval the decision of the Cour d\u2019Appel according to which Libya could rely on \n\nstate immunity because \u2018\u2026 la nature criminelle d\u2019un acte de terrorisme ne permet pas, \u00e0 \n\nelle seule, d\u2019\u00e9carter une pr\u00e9rogative de souverainet\u00e9\u2019.192  \n\nThe Court of Cassation also remarked that, if the prohibition of acts of terrorism \n\nhad the nature of jus cogens, which may constitute a legitimate restriction on state \n\nimmunity, in the case at hand, such a restriction would be disproportionate in respect of the \n\naim pursued because Libya was not being questioned for the commission of acts of \n\nterrorism, but for its moral responsibility. In the words of the Court: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 \u00e0 supposer que l\u2019interdiction des actes de terrorisme puisse \u00eatre mise au rang de norme de \n\njus cogens du droit international, laquelle prime les autres r\u00e8gles du droit international et peut \n\nconstituer une restriction l\u00e9gitime \u00e0 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 de juridiction, une telle restriction serait en \n\nl\u2019esp\u00e8ce disproportionn\u00e9e au regard du but poursuivi d\u00e8s lors que la mise en cause de l\u2019\u00c9tat \n\n\u00e9tranger n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur la commission des actes de terrorisme mais sur sa responsabilit\u00e9 \n\nmoral.\u2019193 \n\n \n\nAccording to a commentator, this passage \u2018pointed \u2026 to the existence of a possible \n\nrestriction to immunity when a claim concerns the reparation of the breach of an obligation \n                                                \n187 GIE La R\u00e9union A\u00e9rienne v La Jamahiriya Arabe Libyenne (Case No 09-14743) (n 184). \n188 ibid. \n189 ibid. \n190 ibid. \n191 ibid. \n192 ibid. \n193 ibid. \n\n\n\n84  \n\nunder jus cogens wherever committed, provided that the breach results from a positive \n\nconduct of the foreign State.\u2019194 In Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, the ICJ rejected \n\nthat this excerpt could imply the existence of such a restriction. In the view of the ICJ, \n\n\u2018[t]he Cour de cassation in [GIE La R\u00e9union A\u00e9rienne v La Jamahiriya Arabe Libyenne] \n\nstated only that, even if a jus cogens norm could constitute a legitimate restriction on State \n\nimmunity, such a restriction could not be justified on the facts of that case.\u2019195 \n\nThe Court of Cassation also considered that the risk of denial of justice could not \n\n\u2018\u2026fl\u00e9chir une r\u00e8gle par laquelle le droit fran\u00e7ais interdit aux tribunaux fran\u00e7ais de \n\nconna\u00eetre d\u2019un litige.\u2019196 Lastly, the Court of Cassation asserted that a waiver to immunity \n\nmust be \u2018\u2026 certaine, expresse et non \u00e9quivoque\u2019.197 Accordingly, Libya\u2019s renunciation of \n\nimmunity in favor of some claimants could not be extended to the others. The Court of \n\nCassation rejected the appeal and upheld the grant of immunity to Libya. \n\n \n\n3.1.5 Poland \n\n \n\n3.1.5.1 Judgment of the Polish Supreme Court in Natoniewski v Germany (2010) \n\n \n\nMr Natoniewski brought a claim against Germany for damages arising from \n\ninjuries suffered during the pacification of Szczecyn during the Second World War. Mr \n\nNatoniewski was six years old at the time and \u2018\u2026 suffered extensive burns to his head, \n\nchest and both hands, with health consequences that are still present.\u2019198 The case reached \n\nthe Polish Supreme Court, which had to rule on whether Polish courts had jurisdiction over \n\nthe claim and on whether immunity was available for Germany.  \n\nThe Polish Supreme Court adopted a very orthodox approach to customary \n\ninternational law, relying on Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ and on the traditional \n\ndefinition of customary international law as being composed of state practice and opinio \n\njuris.199 As regards state immunity, the Polish Supreme Court also adopted a textbook \n\napproach. It considered that until the 1950s the absolute theory of state immunity prevailed \n                                                \n194 Giorgio Gaja, \u2018The Protection of General Interests in the International Community\u2019 (2012) 364 RCADI 9, \n139 (footnote omitted).  \n195  Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Merits: Judgment) [2012] \nICJ Rep 99, [96]. \n196 GIE de R\u00e9union A\u00e9rienne v La Jamahiriya Arabe Libyenne (Case No 09-14743, 9 March 2011) (n 184). \n197 ibid. \n198 Natoniewski v Federal Republic of Germany (Case No IV CSK 465/09) (29 October 2010) 30 PYIL 299 \n(Supreme Court of Poland), 299. \n199 ibid 300. \n\n\n\n85  \n\nand that, in recent times, immunity is only available in respect of acts jure imperii and has \n\nbeen subjected to a growing number of restrictions.200 The Polish Supreme Court asserted \n\nthat state practice supported the tort exception, there being  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026no international duty, on the part of States, to grant immunity to other States in matters of \n\ntorts, if the actions leading to a tort occurred in the territory of the forum State, and if the \n\nauthor of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those actions \n\noccurred.\u2019201  \n\n \n\nSince the tort exception was a more recent restriction to state immunity, the Polish \n\nSupreme Court had to decide whether it applied to the case at hand. It concluded that, \n\nalthough the general rule was that the applicable law is that in force at the time of the \n\noccurrence of the relevant events, in the sphere of procedural law, the principle of direct \n\napplication of the new law prevailed.202 In the light of the procedural aspect of immunity, \n\nthe Polish Supreme Court concluded that it had to apply the rules relating to state \n\nimmunity in force at the time of the Court\u2019s decision on admissibility, and not the rules in \n\nforce at the time of the events which gave rise to Mr Natoniewski\u2019s claim.203 Nevertheless, \n\nthe Polish Supreme Court held that the tort exception did not apply in respect of events \n\nduring armed conflicts and provided the following justification:  \n\n \n\u2018The specificity of the causes of armed conflicts suggests the applicability of state immunity \n\nfor actions arising in the course of these conflicts. Armed conflicts\u2014with victims on a large-\n\nscale and an enormity of destruction and suffering\u2014cannot be reduced to the relationship \n\nbetween the state/perpetrator and the injured person; the conflicts exist mainly between states. \n\nTraditionally, property claims arising from the events of war shall be settled in peace treaties, \n\naimed at a comprehensive\u2014at the international and individual level\u2014regulation of the \n\nconsequences of war. In such cases, jurisdictional immunity provides international law means \n\nfor regulating property claims resulting from the events of war. The removal from court \n\njurisdiction a whole range of civil claims (caused by the war) is designed to counteract the \n\nsituation, when the normalization of relation between states may face obstacles as a result of a \n\nlarge number of proceedings instituted by individuals. The proceedings could be a factor \n\nmaintaining political disputes and not necessarily lead to full satisfaction of claims. The \n\ninternational legal procedure for property claims caused by the events of war in conjunction \n\n                                                \n200 Natoniewski v Federal Republic of Germany (n 198) 300.  \n201 ibid. \n202 ibid 300-301. \n203 ibid 301. \n\n\n\n86  \n\nwith the grant of sovereign immunity is a universal solution. Therefore, the international legal \n\nprocedure for property claims caused by the events of war cannot be seen only from a \n\nperspective of relations between Poland and Germany, that is from a perspective of states \n\nwhich ended the war over sixty years ago.\u2019204 \n\n  \n\nThe Polish Supreme Court also rejected the argument a state is not entitled to \n\nimmunity for the violation of jus cogens rules, although it conceded that it was an \n\n\u2018axiologically doubtful situation\u2019 that immunity was not available for \u2018a single injury\u2019 \n\ncommitted in the territory of the forum state, whilst it was for \u2018massive injury\u2019 caused by \n\nmilitary action.205 The Court provided the following reasons to justify its position. Firstly, \n\nit considered that the implicit waiver theory was inconsistent. In the view of the Polish \n\nSupreme Court, a violation of a jus cogens rule or the accession to international \n\ninstruments protecting human rights could not be understood as a waiver of immunity, \n\nsince a waiver must be clear.206 Secondly, the Polish Supreme Court considered state \n\nimmunity could not be removed on the basis of general principles of law, insofar as state \n\nimmunity is a customary rule and, in the view of the Polish Supreme Court, principles \n\ncould only be invoked to fill lacunae and solve ambiguities.207 Thirdly, the Court asserted \n\nthat the decision to remove immunity could be considered an act of reprisal, which has a \n\npolitical dimension, and it was questionable whether the court would be competent to \n\nperform it.208 Fourthly, the Court contended that the practice of piercing the veil of \n\nimmunity for acts in violation of human rights committed in the forum state \u2018\u2026 [was] by \n\nno means universal.\u2019209 \n\nThe Polish Supreme Court also mentioned the grant of immunity in the case was \n\nconsistent with the case-law of the ECtHR and would not violate Article 6.1 of the \n\nECHR.210 Finally, it ruled that, due to the existence of immunity, a requirement for \n\nnational jurisdiction as provided for in the Polish Code of Civil Procedure had not been \n\nmet.211  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n204 Natoniewski v Federal Republic of Germany (n 198) 301. \n205 ibid 302. \n206 ibid. \n207 ibid. \n208 ibid. \n209 ibid 302-303.  \n210 ibid 303. \n211 ibid. \n\n\n\n87  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.6 The United States \n\n \n\n3.1.6.1 The Princz case \n\n \n\n3.1.6.1.1 Judgment of the District Court for the District of Columbia (1992) \n\n \n\nMr Hugo Princz, a Jewish American, brought a claim against Germany before the \n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to recover damages \n\nsuffered by him as a result of his internment in various concentration camps by the Nazis \n\nduring the Second World War.212 At the time they were arrested, in 1942, he and his family \n\nlived in Czechoslovakia.213 Mr Princz and his family were subjected to unfathomable \n\natrocities, including enslavement. He was the only member of his family to survive the \n\natrocities perpetrated by the Nazi regime.214 Mr Princz was unsuccessful in his endeavors \n\nto obtain a pension or other form of reparation under the compensation schemes set up by \n\nGermany for victims of the Holocaust.215 Attempts to obtain an ex gratia payment from \n\nGermany were also unsuccessful.216  \n\nIn its ruling on jurisdiction, District Judge Sporkin began by recalling that, in the \n\nAmerada Hess case, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the FSIA was the \n\nsole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in US courts. Nevertheless, in the \n\nlight of the facts of the case, District Judge Sporkin concluded that the understanding of \n\nthe Supreme Court in Amerada Hess was not a bar to jurisdiction. He also added Germany \n\nwas estopped from invoking US law, since it had showed blatant disregard for the US and \n\nfor international law:  \n\n \n\u2018The Supreme Court [in Amerada Hess] did not have such extraordinary facts as those \n\npresently before this Court in rendering its decision in Hess. And the Court cannot believe that, \n                                                \n212 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany [1996] 103 ILR 598 (United States District Court, District of \nColumbia), 598. \n213 ibid. \n214 ibid. \n215 ibid. \n216 ibid. \n\n\n\n88  \n\nin enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Congress contemplated a factual scenario \n\nakin to that at bar, let alone that it intended to bar a U.S. citizen from seeking redress against a \n\nnation standing in the shoes of his or her would-be butcher in U.S. courts in a case such as this. \n\nTherefore, this Court concludes that neither Hess nor the FSIA itself bars this Court from \n\nhearing the plaintiff\u2019s claim.  \n\n\u2018This Court finds that the Federal Sovereign Immunities Act has no role to play where the \n\nclaims alleged involve undisputed acts of barbarism committed by a onetime outlaw nation \n\nwhich demonstrated callous disrespect for the humanity of an American citizen, simply \n\nbecause he was Jewish. The Court cannot permit such a nation, which at the time these \n\nbarbaric acts were committed neither recognized nor respected U.S. or international law, to \n\nnow block the legitimate claims of a U.S. citizen by asserting U.S. law to evade its \n\nresponsibilities. A government which stands in the shoes of a rogue nation the likes of Nazi \n\nGermany is estopped from asserting U.S. law in this fashion. To allow otherwise would create \n\na severe imbalance in the reciprocity and mutual respect which must exist between nations, and \n\nwould work an intolerable injustice against the plaintiff and the principles for which this \n\ncountry stands.\u2019217 \n\n \n\nAs further arguments, District Judge Sporkin also mentioned that it was unlikely \n\nthat Mr Princz would be able to obtain a remedy before German courts, since the German \n\nSupreme Court, in an administrative determination, had signaled Mr Princz\u2019s claim would \n\nbe denied.218 District Judge Sporkin reasoned that the case involved not only a violation of \n\ninternational law, but also the violation of Mr Princz\u2019s rights of citizenship and as a human \n\nbeing.219 Thus, although \u2018Congress did indeed fashion a comprehensive scheme regarding \n\nU.S. courts\u2019 jurisdiction over foreign nations\u2019, it had not \u2018\u2026stripped Americans of their \n\nrights of citizenship or of their right to be protected by [the United States] government and \n\n\u2026 laws just because they travel overseas.\u2019220 District Judge Sporkin concluded that to deny \n\nMr Princz redress in the US courts \u2018\u2026 would complete the stripping of Mr. Princz\u2019s most \n\nvaluable rights of citizenship.\u2019221 \n\n \n\n3.1.6.1.2 Judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (1994) \n\n \n\nGermany appealed the decision of the District Court to deny its motion to dismiss \n\nthe suit. Circuit Judge Ginsburg, who delivered the judgment for the Court of Appeals, \n                                                \n217 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany (n 212) 601. \n218 ibid. \n219 ibid 600. \n220 ibid 601. \n221 ibid 602. \n\n\n\n89  \n\nconsidered that he did not have to decide whether the FSIA applied retroactively because \n\nthe District Court would lack jurisdiction whether the FSIA applied or not. Mr Princz had \n\nargued that the US courts had jurisdiction under the FSIA based on the commercial activity \n\nexception, the implied waiver exception and the international agreement exception. Judge \n\nGinsburg proceeded to examine the bases of jurisdiction invoked by Mr Princz.  \n\nSection 1605.a.2 of the FSIA provides that a foreign state  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States or of the States \n\nin any case ... in which the action is based ... upon an act outside the territory of the United \n\nStates in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign sovereign elsewhere and that act \n\ncauses a direct effect in the United States.\u2019222  \n\n \n\nMr Princz stated that the Nazi government leased his labor for profit to German \n\ncompanies and argued that this was a commercial activity that had a direct effect on the \n\nUnited States.223 Judge Ginsburg considered that he did not have to rule on whether leasing \n\nslave labor to private companies was a commercial activity under the FSIA because this \n\nactivity did not have a \u2018direct effect\u2019 in the United States, and that rendered the \n\ncommercial exception inapplicable. Judge Ginsburg dismissed Mr Princz\u2019s argument that, \n\nsince the companies for which he was forced to provide labor aided Germany in the war \n\neffort, the \u2018direct effect\u2019 requirement was met. Judge Ginsburg considered that \u2018many \n\nevents and actors necessarily intervened between any work that Mr. Princz performed \u2026 \n\nand any effect felt in the United States\u2019, and thus the \u2018direct effect requirement was not \n\nmet.\u2019224 Mr Princz had also argued that Germany utilized the mail, wire and banking \n\nsystem of the United States to administer its reparation schemes for the victims of the Nazi \n\nregime. Judge Ginsburg asserted that the administration of reparation schemes could not \n\namount to a \u2018direct effect\u2019 of Mr Princz\u2019s enslavement.225 Lastly, Judge Ginsburg did not \n\naccept the argument that Mr Princz\u2019s continued suffering in the US could be considered a \n\n\u2018direct effect in the United States\u2019.226 \n\nThe waiver exception is provided for in Section 1605.a.1 of the FSIA. It establishes \n\nthat state immunity is not available in cases in which \u2018\u2026  the foreign state has waived its \n\n                                                \n222 US Code, Section 1605&lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605> accessed 26 November 2015. \n223 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany [1996] 103 ILR 604 (United States Court of Appeals, District of \nColumbia Circuit), 607-608. \n224 ibid 608. \n225 ibid. \n226 ibid 608-609. \n\n\n\n90  \n\nimmunity either explicitly or by implication, notwithstanding any withdrawal of the waiver \n\nwhich the foreign state may purport to effect except in accordance with the terms of the \n\nwaiver.\u2019227 It was argued that Germany had implicitly waived its immunity by violating jus \n\ncogens norms. Although acknowledging the violation of jus cogens norms by Germany, \n\nJudge Ginsburg dismissed this argument and adopted the same understanding of the Court \n\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Siderman de Blake, according to which, lacking an \n\nexception in the FSIA, the violation of jus cogens norms could not, in itself, confer \n\njurisdiction.228 Judge Ginsburg added that the \u2018\u2026 jus cogens theory of implied waiver is \n\nincompatible with the intentionality requirement implicit in \u00a7 1605(a)(l).\u2019229 Germany had \n\nnot showed \u2018its amenability to suit\u2019, so the waiver exception could not be used as a basis of \n\njurisdiction in the case.230  \n\nJudge Ginsburg moved next to the \u2018treaty provision exception\u2019. Section 1604 of the \n\nFSIA establishes that a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the \n\nUnited States \u2018\u2026 [s]ubject to existing international agreements to which the United States \n\nis a party at the time of enactment of this Act.\u2019231 Mr Princz relied on the 1907 Hague \n\nConvention (IV). Article 52 of the Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention (IV) \n\nestablishes that the inhabitants of an occupied State shall not be required to \u2018\u2026 [take] part \n\nin military operations against their own country.\u2019232 Article 3 of the Hague Convention \n\n(IV) provides that \u2018[a] belligerent party which violates the provisions of the said \n\nRegulations shall, if the case demands, be liable to pay compensation.\u2019233 Judge Sporkin \n\nconsidered that the Hague Convention (IV) did not create a private right of action. \n\nFurthermore, recalling Amerada Hess, he asserted that the \u2018treaty provision exception\u2019 is \n\nonly applicable when there is an \u2018express conflict\u2019 between the international agreement \n\nand the immunity provisions of the FSIA.234  \n\nHaving established that there was not a jurisdictional basis under the FSIA even if \n\nit applied retroactively, Judge Ginsburg added that it could not \u2018revive the pre-FSIA \n\ndiversity jurisdiction\u2019, which was enshrined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, because Congress had \n\n                                                \n227 US Code, Section 1605 (n 222).  \n228 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany (n 223) 610. \n229 ibid. \n230 ibid. \n231 US Code, Section 1604&lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1604> accessed 26 November 2015.  \n232  Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations \nconcerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (adopted 18 October 1907, entered into force 26 January \n1910) &lt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague04.asp> accessed 26 November 2015. \n233 ibid. \n234 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany (n 223) 611. \n\n\n\n91  \n\neliminated this head of jurisdiction when it passed the FSIA.235 Furthermore, he added the \n\nclaims brought by Mr Princz were based on tort and quasi-contract law, and not on federal \n\nlaw, and that placed the case outside the federal question jurisdiction.236 \n\nThe Court of Appeal upheld Germany\u2019s appeal and reversed the finding of the \n\nDistrict Court.  \n\n \n\n3.1.6.1.2.1 The dissenting opinion of Judge Wald appended to the judgment of the \n\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Princz v Germany (1994)  \n\n \n\nCircuit Judge Wald appended a dissenting opinion to the judgment of the Court. \n\nJudge Wald started her dissenting opinion with a detailed account of the sufferings \n\ninflicted upon Mr Princz by Germany and offered a critique of Germany\u2019s conduct: \n\n \n\u2018Despite its public professions of penitence for the horrors of the Holocaust \u2026 Germany \n\nrepeatedly relied on technicalities such as Princz\u2019s citizenship at the time of his enslavement to \n\ndeny him either a pension or any restitution for his immense suffering. Ironically, had Princz \n\nnot been an American citizen at the time of the Holocaust, he would have received \n\ncompensation.\u2019237  \n\n \n\nJudge Wald understood the FSIA applied. She considered the language of the FSIA \n\nwas ambiguous and relied on the standard provided in Landgraf v USI Film Prods. by the \n\nSupreme Court in respect of retroactivity analysis, according to which  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [w]hen \u2026 the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine \n\nwhether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a \n\nparty possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct, or impose new \n\nduties with respect to transactions already completed.\u2019238 \n\n \n\n                                                \n235 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany (n 223) 607. \n236 US Code: Title 28\u2014Judiciary and Judicial Procedure&lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28 > \naccessed 26 November 2015: \n \n\n\u201828 U.S. Code \u00a7 1331\u2014Federal question\u2014The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of \nall civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u2019 \n \n\n237 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Wald) [1996] 103 ILR 612 (United \nStates Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit), 613. \n238 Landgraf v USI Film Prods. (1994) 511 US 244 (Supreme Court of the United States). \n\n\n\n92  \n\nThe relevant test as regards retroactivity was, therefore, to determine whether the \n\nFSIA would \u2018impair rights a party possessed when he acted\u2019. She considered that at the \n\ntime the events took place, between 1942 and 1945, the practice of the courts of the United \n\nStates concerning state immunity was to \u2018[defer] \u2026 to the case-by-case foreign policy \n\ndeterminations of the executive branch.\u2019239 Judge Wald concluded Germany could not \n\nhave expected the Executive branch to suggest immunity for acts related to the Holocaust: \n\n \n\u2018In the mid-1940s, Germany could not, even in its wildest dreams, have expected the executive \n\nbranch of the United States, as a matter of grace and comity, to suggest immunity for its \n\nenslavement and confinement (in three concentration camps) of an American citizen during the \n\nHolocaust. The outcome of the Nuremberg trials provides a clear signal that the international \n\ncommunity, and particularly the United States\u2014one of the four nations that established the \n\nNuremberg Tribunal\u2014would not have supported a broad enough immunity to shroud the \n\natrocities committed during the Holocaust. \u2026 Clearly, had the question been put to them, the \n\nUnited States executive branch would have opted to deny Germany\u2019s claims to immunity for \n\nthe crimes alleged in this case.\u2019240 \n\n \n\nIn the light of these considerations, Judge Wald concluded that \u2018\u2026because the \n\nFSIA infringes upon no rights held by Germany at the time it enslaved and imprisoned \n\nPrincz, it applies to this case.\u2019241  \n\nJudge Wald held that Germany had implicitly waived its right to state immunity by \n\nviolating the jus cogens norms which prohibit enslavement and genocide. Underscoring the \n\nwatershed represented by the Nuremberg trials, she stated the following: \n\n \n\u2018Prior to the Nuremberg trials, the positivist theory of international law governed state \n\nsovereignty, and a state\u2019s treatment of its own citizens was considered immune from the \n\ndictates of international law. \u2026 The Nuremberg trials thus permanently eroded any notion that \n\nthe mantle of sovereign immunity could serve to cloak an act that constitutes a \u201ccrime against \n\nhumanity,\u201d even if that act is confined within the borders of a single sovereign state.  \n\nBecause the Nuremberg Charter\u2019s definition of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d includes what are \n\nnow termed jus cogens norms, a state is never entitled to immunity for any act that contravenes \n\na jus cogens norm, regardless of where or against whom that act was perpetrated.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 Jus cogens norms are by definition nonderogable, and thus when a state thumbs its nose at \n\nsuch a norm, in effect overriding the collective will of the entire international community, the \n\n                                                \n239 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Wald) (n 237) 614-615. \n240 ibid 615. \n241 ibid. \n\n\n\n93  \n\nstate cannot be performing a sovereign act entitled to immunity. When the Nazis tore off \n\nPrincz\u2019s clothes, exchanged them for a prison uniform and a tattoo, shoved him behind the \n\nspiked barbed wire fences of Auschwitz and Dachau, and sold him to the German armament \n\nindustry as fodder for their wartime labor operation, Germany rescinded any claim under \n\ninternational law to immunity from this court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u2019242 \n\n \n\nJudge Wald\u2019s next step was to reconcile the operation of the implicit waiver in the \n\nsphere of international law with the FSIA. Judge Wald recalled that, in the Paquete \n\nHabana case, the Supreme Court declared that international law is part of the law of the \n\nUnited States.243 It followed, according to Judge Wald, that the FSIA should be construed \n\nconsistently with international law: \n\n \n\u2018The only way to reconcile the FSIA\u2019s presumption of foreign sovereign immunity with \n\ninternational law is to interpret \u00a7 1605(a)(1) [the waiver exception] of the Act as encompassing \n\nthe principle that a foreign state implicitly waives its right to sovereign immunity in United \n\nStates courts by violating jus cogens norms. \n\n\u2018Construing \u00a7 1605(a)(l) to include as an implied waiver a foreign state\u2019s breach of a jus \n\ncogens norm is not at odds with the language and legislative history of the FSIA, which supply \n\nscant guidance as to the provision\u2019s meaning.\u2019244 \n\n \n\nJudge Wald concluded that, by interpreting the FSIA in accordance with \n\ninternational law, under Section 1605.a.1 of the FSIA, Germany had waived its immunity.  \n\n \n\n3.1.7 The United Kingdom  \n\n \n\n3.1.7.1 Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and \n\nOthers (1996)   \n\n \n\nLord Justice Stuart-Smith provided a summary of the facts of the case. Mr Al-\n\nAdsani, a dual British and Kuwaiti national, was a member of the Kuwait Air Forces who \n\nfought in the Gulf War. Mr Al-Adsani remained in Kuwait as a member of the resistance \n\nmovement during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.245 In this context, he came into possession \n\n                                                \n242 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Wald) (n 237) 618. \n243 Paquete Habana (1900) 175 US 677, 700:  \u2018International law is part of our law \u2026\u2019 \n244 Princz v Federal Republic of Germany (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Wald) (n 237) 619.  \n245 Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others [1998] 107 ILR 536 (Court of Appeal), 538. \n\n\n\n94  \n\nof video tapes of a sexual nature belonging to Sheikh Jaber Al-Sabah Al-Saud Al-Sabah, \n\nwho is related to the Emir of Kuwait and was considered an influential figure in Kuwait.246 \n\nThe contents of these video tapes entered circulation and the Sheikh blamed Mr Al-Adsani \n\nfor it.247 After the Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait, in May 1991, Mr Al-Adsani \n\nalleged the following, as described by Lord Justice Evans: \n\n \n\u2018On 2 May 1991, the plaintiff [Mr Al-Adsani] was taken at gun point from his house in Kuwait. \n\nHe was taken in a government car to the State security prison and was there subjected to very \n\nconsiderable physical ill-treatment.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 The matter did not rest there because on 7 May the plaintiff was again taken at gun point, \n\nthis time to what is described as a royal palace of some member of the ruling family. There he \n\nwas first immersed in a swimming pool said to have contained a number of corpses, and then \n\nwas placed in a cell together with a mattress which had been impregnated with petrol and \n\nwhich was afterwards set alight. The plaintiff managed to avoid being burned alive, which is \n\nwhat appears to have been intended. He was then threatened that he would be shot, but \n\nfortunately that fate was avoided also.  \n\n\u2018He undoubtedly suffered very serious burns.\u2019248  \n\n \n\nTorture is an international crime and there is a wide consensus that its prohibition is \n\na norm with the status of jus cogens. The prohibition against torture is enshrined in UNGA \n\nResolution 3452 (XXX) of 9 December 1975 (\u2018Declaration on the Protection of All \n\nPersons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \n\nTreatment or Punishment\u2019), in the CAT 1984, and, at the European level, in the ECHR. In \n\nthe United Kingdom, pursuant to Sections 134 and 135 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, \n\ntorture is a crime punishable in the UK even if committed elsewhere\u2013\u2013the exercise of \n\ncriminal jurisdiction, nevertheless, is only possible \u2018\u2026 if the accused is physically present \n\nwithin the jurisdiction or amenable to extradition.\u2019249  \n\nIn the United Kingdom, state immunity is governed by the SIA 1978, whose \n\nrelevant provisions are the following:  \n\n \n\u20181\u2013\u2013General immunity from jurisdiction. \n\n                                                \n246 Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others (n 245) 538. \n247 ibid. \n248 Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others [1995] 100 ILR 465 (Court of Appeal), 468. \n249  Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others (n 245) 541; Criminal Justice Act 1988 \n<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/contents> accessed 26 November 2015. \n\n\n\n95  \n\n\u2018(1) A State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as \n\nprovided in the following provisions of this Part of this Act. \n\n\u2018(2) A court shall give effect to the immunity conferred by this section even though the State \n\ndoes not appear in the proceedings in question. \n\n\u2018\u2026 5\u2013\u2013Personal injuries and damage to property. \n\n\u2018A State is not immune as respects proceedings in respect of\u2014 \n\n\u2018(a) death or personal injury; or \n\n\u2018(b) damage to or loss of tangible property,  \n\n\u2018caused by an act or omission in the United Kingdom.\u2019250 \n\n \n\nMr Al-Adsani\u2019s counsel argued that Section 1.1 of the SIA, which establishes that \n\n\u2018[a] State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as \n\nprovided in the following provisions of this Part of this Act\u2019, should be read as implying \n\nthat immunity should only be accorded if the state is acting \u2018within the Law of Nations\u2019.251 \n\nIn his view, since the prohibition against torture is a norm belonging to the corpus of jus \n\ncogens and its violation amounts to an international crime, it should override state \n\nimmunity.252  \n\nLord Justice Stuart-Smith disagreed with this understanding: \n\n \n\u2018The argument is, however, that international law against torture is so fundamental that it is a \n\njus cogens, or compelling law, which overrides all other principles of international law, \n\nincluding the well-established principles of sovereign immunity. No authority is cited for this \n\nproposition. 253 \n\n\u2018\u2026 [T]he Act [the SIA] is a comprehensive code and is not subject to overriding \n\nconsiderations. At common law, a sovereign State could not be sued at all against its will in the \n\ncourts of this country. The 1978 Act, by the exceptions therein set out, marks substantial \n\ninroads into this principle. It is inconceivable, it seems to me, that the draughtsman, who must \n\nhave been well aware of the various international agreements about torture, intended Section 1 \n\nto be subject to an overriding qualification.\u2019254  \n\n \n\nHis Lordship further supported his position by assessing the case-law of United \n\nStates courts on the matter. The US, as the UK, has a codification of the law of state \n\nimmunity. In Argentine Republic v Amerada Hess Shipping Corporation, the United States \n\n                                                \n250 State Immunity Act 1978&lt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/33> accessed 26 November 2015. \n251 Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others (n 245) 540. \n252 ibid 541. \n253 ibid. \n254 ibid 542. \n\n\n\n96  \n\nSupreme Court established the FSIA was the sole basis to obtain jurisdiction over a foreign \n\nstate in the courts of the US\u2014in the words of Chief Justice Rehnquist, who delivered the \n\nopinion of the court, Congress dealt \u2018comprehensively with the subject of foreign \n\nsovereign immunity in the FSIA\u2026\u2019255. In Siderman de Blake v Argentina, the US Court of \n\nAppeals for the Ninth District, although mentioning that the theory according to which a \n\nstate\u2019s violation of jus cogens would not be entitled to immunity under international law \n\nwas compelling, concluded that, in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Amerada \n\nHess, the violation of jus cogens norms committed outside the United States does not \n\nconfer jurisdiction to the courts of the United States since the FSIA does not provide for \n\nsuch an exception to state immunity.256 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith understood that, in this \n\nregard, the SIA functioned like the FSIA in the reading given by the Supreme Court to this \n\nstatute. He also argued domestic courts are not an appropriate forum to assert jurisdiction \n\n                                                \n255 Argentine Republic v Amerada Hess Shipping Corporation (1989) 488 US 428 (Supreme Court of the \nUnited States), 438. \n256 Siderman de Blake v Argentina (1992) 965 F.2d 699 (United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit), 718-\n719. Circuit Judge Fletcher pronounced himself in the following way:  \n \n\n\u2018The question in the present case is what flows from the Sidermans\u2019 allegation that Argentina \ntortured Jose Siderman and thereby violated a jus cogens norm. The Sidermans contend that \nwhen a foreign state\u2019s act violates jus cogens, the state is not entitled to sovereign immunity \nwith respect to that act.  \n\u2018\u2026 As a matter of international law, the Sidermans\u2019 argument carries much force.  \n\u2018\u2026 The Sidermans posit that because sovereign immunity derives from international law, jus \ncogens supersedes it. \u2026 International law does not recognize an act that violates jus cogens as \na sovereign act. A state\u2019s violation of the jus cogens norm prohibiting official torture therefore \nwould not be entitled to the immunity afforded by international law.  \n\u2018Unfortunately, we do not write on a clean slate. We deal not only with customary international \nlaw, but with an affirmative Act of Congress, the FSIA. We must interpret the FSIA through \nthe prism of Amerada Hess. Nothing in the text or legislative history of the FSIA explicitly \naddresses the effect violations of jus cogens might have on the FSIA\u2019s cloak of immunity. \nArgentina contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in Amerada Hess that the FSIA grants \nimmunity \u201cin those cases involving alleged violations of international law that do not come \nwithin one of the FSIA\u2019s exceptions,\u201d 488 U.S. at 436, 109 S.Ct. at 688, precludes the \nSidermans\u2019 reliance on jus cogens in this case. Clearly, the FSIA does not specifically provide \nfor an exception to sovereign immunity based on jus cogens. In Amerada Hess, the Court had \nno occasion to consider acts of torture or other violations of the peremptory norms of \ninternational law, and such violations admittedly differ in kind from transgressions of jus \ndispositivum, the norms derived from international agreements or customary international law \nwith which the Amerada Hess Court dealt. However, the Court was so emphatic in its \npronouncement \u201cthat immunity is granted in those cases involving alleged violations of \ninternational law that do not come within one of the FSIA\u2019s exceptions,\u201d Amerada Hess, 488 \nU.S. at 436, 109 S.Ct. at 688, and so specific in its formulation and method of approach, id. at \n439, 109 S.Ct. at 690 (\u201cHaving determined that the FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining \njurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court, we turn to whether any of the exceptions \nenumerated in the Act apply here\u201d), that we conclude that if violations of jus cogens committed \noutside the United States are to be exceptions to immunity, Congress must make them so. The \nfact that there has been a violation of jus cogens does not confer jurisdiction under the FSIA.\u2019 \n \n\n\n\n97  \n\nover an uncooperative foreign sovereign in respect of violations of jus cogens committed \n\noutside the territory of the forum state: \n\n \n\u2018The courts in the United Kingdom are open to all who seek their help, whether they are British \n\ncitizens or not. A vast number of people come to this country each year seeking refuge and \n\nasylum, and many of these allege that they have been tortured in the country whence they \n\ncame. Some of these claims are no doubt justified, others are more doubtful. Those who are \n\npresently charged with the responsibility for deciding whether applicants are genuine refugees \n\nhave a difficult enough task, but at least they know much of the background and surrounding \n\ncircumstances against which the claim is made. The court would be in no such position. The \n\nforeign State would be unlikely to submit to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom court, and \n\nin its absence the court would have no means of testing the claim or making a just \n\ndetermination.\u2019257  \n\n \n\nLord Justice Ward took note he found \u2018powerful\u2019 the submission state immunity is \n\ntrumped by jus cogens under international law. As put by him: \n\n \n\u2018Not to accede to it would have the ironic result that there may be no international forum (other \n\nthan the forum of the locus delicti to whom a victim of torture will be understandably reluctant \n\nto turn) where this terrible, if established, wrong can receive civil redress.\u2019258 \n\n \n\nNevertheless, he agreed with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith that the SIA bound the \n\nCourt and that only the exceptions to state immunity expressly provided for in this statute \n\ncould be accepted: \n\n \n\u2018It is inconceivable that Parliament legislated for the loss of State immunity when the acts \n\ncausing that person injury are committed in the United Kingdom without having borne in mind \n\n its clearest international obligations to recognize the fundamental freedom from torture which \n\neveryone should enjoy everywhere. Unfortunately, the Act is as plain as plain can be. A \n\nforeign State enjoys no immunity for acts causing personal injury committed in the United \n\nKingdom and if that is expressly provided for the conclusion is impossible to escape that State \n\nimmunity is afforded in respect of acts of torture committed outside this jurisdiction.\u2019259  \n\n \n\n                                                \n257 Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others (n 245) 544. \n258 ibid 547. \n259 ibid 549-550. \n\n\n\n98  \n\n Mr Al-Adsani\u2019s appeal was dismissed and he eventually brought the case to the \n\nECtHR.  \n\n \n\n3.1.7.2 The Jones case \n\n \n\n3.1.7.2.1 Judgment of the High Court (2003)  \n\n \n\nThe facts of the case were described as follows by the High Court. Mr Jones, a \n\nBritish national, worked as an international tax adviser in Saudi Arabia, when he got \n\ninjured as a result of a \u2018bomb blast outside a bookstore\u2019 in the city of Riyadh and was \n\ntaken to a hospital.260  He alleged that, on 16 March 2001, agents of the Kingdom of Saudi \n\nArabia \u2018took him from the hospital and falsely imprisoned him in solitary confinement\u2019, \n\nwhere, for sixty-seven days, he was \u2018systematically abused and tortured\u2019 by Lieutenant \n\nColonel Abdul Aziz.261 Mr Jones sued the Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi \n\nArabia and Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz \u2018\u2026 for damages including aggravated and \n\nexemplary damages for assault and battery and trespass to the person, torture and unlawful \n\nimprisonment on and between 16 March and 21 May 2001.\u2019262 The High Court asserted \n\nthere was no doubt Mr Jones\u2019s allegations amounted to torture.263 \n\n                                                \n260 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another [2007] 129 ILR 636 (High \nCourt), 637. \n261 ibid. \n262 ibid 636. \n263 ibid 637-638: \n \n\n\u20185. That the allegations made against the defendant in this case amount to torture is plain. The \nclaimant alleges that he was beaten on the palms of the hand with a cane about 4ft long with \nhands cuffed behind him with the back palms uppermost; of being beaten on the soles of the \nfeet with a cane and also a wooden stave resembling an axe handle and being beaten on the \narms, buttocks and lower legs with a wooden stave resembling an axe handle; of slapping and \nrelatively mild punching in the facial area; of suspension of the cuffed hands above the level of \nhis head by attaching them to window fitments; of the shackling of his ankles; of sleep \ndeprivation achieved through being put in partly suspended postures; of being struck anywhere \non the body both with and without weapons and being disturbed by noise and by the \nadministration of mind-affecting drugs and other substances.  \n\u20186. The claimant says that the result of the injuries he sustained was, at the time, severe pain, \ndiscomfort, bruising and swelling and physical and mental trauma. The claimant says that he \nnow suffers from substantial mental trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, is severely \npsychologically disabled and is unable to work. He is undergoing treatment and a course of \nmedication but the prospect for speedy recovery is poor. There is consequently a considerable \nclaim for loss of future earnings and the overall value of the claim is put by the claimant at \nsomething in the region of \u00a32.5m.\u2019 \n \n\n\n\n99  \n\nThe High Court followed the approach the Court of Appeal had adopted in Al-\n\nAdsani v Government of Kuwait and others: it held that the SIA was a comprehensive \n\ncode, \u2018intended to make new provisions for sovereign immunity replacing the common law \n\nin its entirety in relation to civil claims.\u2019264 Accordingly, the High Court found the SIA did \n\nnot provide any exception to state immunity applicable to the claims of the plaintiff.265 The \n\nHigh Court added the ECtHR in Al-Adsani v the United Kingdom found the English courts \n\nin Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others had not violated Article 6 of the \n\nECHR.266 Although the High Court regretted the missed opportunity the ECtHR had and \n\nconsidered the minority dissenting opinions attached to the judgment \u2018compelling\u2019, it \n\nasserted that \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 unless Parliament specifically amends the State Immunity Act in this respect, or another \n\ncase comes before the European Court of Human Rights in which the minority view in Al-\n\nAdsani prevails, so that our courts can thereafter consider the making of a declaration of \n\nincompatibility in respect of the 1978 [State Immunity] Act as it applies to civil actions for \n\ntorture, the Act deprives me and the English courts of jurisdiction over the first defendant in \n\nthis case. For that reason, with the greatest sympathy for the claimant, I must allow the \n\napplication of the first defendant and dismiss the claim against them.\u2019267 \n\n \n\nThe High Court also decided Mr Jones\u2019s torturer, Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz, \n\nwas entitled to the same immunity accorded to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, since the \n\nclaim against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was pleaded on the basis of its vicarious \n\nresponsibility for the acts of Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz.268 According to the High \n\nCourt, \n\n \n\u2018To reach a conclusion that the first defendant [the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] was not liable by \n\nreason of state immunity while holding that they are vicarious liable for the second defendant \n\n[Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz] would undo the result reached in the Al-Adsani case.\u2019269 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n264 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 260) 640. \n265 ibid 640.  \n266 ibid 646. \n267 ibid 647. \n268 ibid 648.  \n269 ibid.  \n\n\n\n100  \n\n3.1.7.2.2 Judgment of the Court of Appeal (2004)  \n\n \n\nMr Jones appealed against the decision of the High Court. The Court of Appeal \n\njoined Mr Jones\u2019s case with another similar case brought by Messrs Mitchell and Sampson \n\n(British nationals) and Mr Walker (a Canadian national) against Ibrahim Al-Dali, Khalid \n\nAl-Saleh, Colonel Mohamed Al-Said and Prince Naif, all Saudi Arabian nationals and who \n\nwere, at the time, respectively, a captain in the Saudi Arabian police force, a lieutenant in \n\nthe Saudi Arabian police force, a colonel in the Ministry of Interior and Deputy Governor \n\nof the Al Ha\u2019ir prison, and head of the Ministry of the Interior.270 These claimants had also \n\nallegedly been systematically tortured whilst under official custody in the Kingdom of \n\nSaudi Arabia and had also had their applications dismissed by the High Court on the same \n\ngrounds of its previous ruling in respect of Mr Jones\u2019s application.271   \n\nLord Justice Mance understood the Court of Appeal had to settle two questions:  \n\n \n\u2018First, is the Kingdom entitled to immunity in respect of Mr Jones\u2019s claim, which it accepts has \n\nbeen served on it? Second, is the Kingdom entitled to claim immunity on behalf of its officials \n\nin respect of the claims made against those officials in both Mr Jones\u2019s and Messrs Mitchell\u2019s, \n\nSampson\u2019s and Walker\u2019s claims?\u2019272  \n\n \n\nLord Justice Mance did not depart from the position the Court of Appeal took in Al-\n\nAdsani v Government of Kuwait, which considered that the SIA was a \u2018comprehensive \n\ncode, and that, although international law prohibited torture, no express or implied \n\nexception to immunity existed in cases of torture.\u2019273 In the same way, Lord Justice Mance \n\nremembered the ECtHR had decided that the restriction imposed on Article 6.1 of the \n\nECHR by the English courts pursued a legitimate aim and was proportionate.274 Recalling \n\nthe decision of the majority in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom and one of the passages in \n\nHazel Fox\u2019s treatise on the law of state immunity275, Lord Justice Mance did not accept the \n\n                                                \n270 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another; Mitchell and others v Al-\nDali and others [2007] 129 ILR 649 (Court of Appeal), 649-650. \n271 ibid. \n272 ibid 652. \n273 ibid 654.  \n274 ibid 654-655. \n275 Hazel Fox, The Law of State Immunity (2nd edn, OUP 2002) 525:  \n \n\n\u2018State immunity is a procedural rule going to the jurisdiction of a national court. It does not go \nto substantive law; it does not contradict a prohibition contained in a jus cogens norm but \nmerely diverts any breach of it to a different method of settlement. Arguably then, there is no \n\n\n\n101  \n\nsubmission that the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture prevailed over the \n\nhierarchically inferior rules of state immunity: \n\n \n\u2018The recognition under general principles of international law of civil immunity on the part of \n\na state from civil suit in a state other than that of the alleged torture does not sanction the \n\ntorture or qualify the prohibition upon it. It qualifies the jurisdictions in which and means by \n\nwhich the peremptory norms may be enforced. There is a distinction between principles of \n\nsubstantive international law and other issues, such as jurisdiction and immunity in civil \n\nproceedings in any particular jurisdiction \u2026\u2019276  \n\n \n\nLord Justice Mance turned next to the question of whether Article 14 of the CAT \n\nrequired the United Kingdom to establish a civil right of redress for its nationals who were \n\nvictims of torture abroad. Article 14 of the CAT provides that:  \n\n \n\u20181. Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains \n\nredress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the means \n\nfor as full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act \n\nof torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation. \n\n\u20182. Nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim or other persons to compensation \n\nwhich may exist under national law.\u2019277  \n\n \n\nLord Justice Mance considered that \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the article does not state expressly whether there must be any or what connection between \n\nthe state which must ensure such redress and either the act or the victim. \u2026 [I]t seems unlikely \n\nthat it can have been intended that every state should ensure that its legal system provided \n\nredress for every act of torture by the public officials (or by other persons acting in an official \n\ncapacity) of other states, wherever committed and whoever the victim.\u2019278 \n\n \n\nTo properly interpret Article 14 of the CAT, Lord Justice Mance compared it with \n\nArticles 4 and 5 of the same treaty, which establish rules concerning criminal jurisdiction:  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                              \n\nsubstantive content in the procedural plea of State immunity upon which a jus cogens mandate \ncan bite.\u2019 \n\n \n276 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 656-657. \n277 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (adopted \n10 December 1984, entered into force 26 June 1987) 1465 UNTS 85. \n278 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 657.  \n\n\n\n102  \n\n\u2018Article 4 \n\n\u20181. Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The \n\nsame shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and to an act by any person which constitutes \n\ncomplicity or participation in torture.  \n\n\u20182. Each State Party shall make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take \n\ninto account their grave nature. \n\n\u2018Article 5 \n\n\u20181. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction \n\nover the offences referred to in article 4 in the following cases: \n\n\u2018(a) When the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship \n\nor aircraft registered in that State; \n\n\u2018(b) When the alleged offender is a national of that State; \n\n\u2018(c) When the victim is a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate. \n\n\u20182. Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its \n\njurisdiction over such offences in cases where the alleged offender is present in any territory \n\nunder its jurisdiction and it does not extradite him pursuant to article 8 to any of the States \n\nmentioned in paragraph I of this article. \n\n\u20183. This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with \n\ninternal law.\u2019279 \n \n\nMirroring Article 5.1.a, Lord Justice Mance considered Article 14 could be \n\ninterpreted to mean that \u2018\u2026 it is only concerned to ensure a right of redress in the state \n\nwhere an act of torture is committed.\u2019280 Further building upon the definition of torture \n\nenshrined in Article 1 of the CAT, according to which torture \u2018\u2026 is inflicted by or at the \n\ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting \n\nin an official capacity\u2019, His Lordship asserted that \u2018it would seem curious if each state \n\nwere not required to ensure a civil right of redress in respect of torture committed abroad \n\nby one of its officers\u2019.281 However, as added by Lord Justice Mance, neither of these \n\ninterpretations would require the United Kingdom to provide means of redress regarding \n\nan act of torture committed abroad by a foreign official. He further justified this \n\nunderstanding by mentioning that Article 5.1.c. leaves to the discretion of the state whether \n\nto exercise or not criminal jurisdiction on the basis that the victim of torture was one of its \n\nnationals, so that it would be improbable that states would be required to establish civil \n\n                                                \n279 Convention Against Torture (n 277).  \n280 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 658-659. \n281 ibid.  \n\n\n\n103  \n\njurisdiction on the same basis.282 On this matter, Lord Justice Mance concluded the \n\nfollowing: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 article 14(1) is dealing with (no more than) a right of redress in the legal system of the state \n\n(state A) by whose official (or other person acting in a public capacity) the alleged act of \n\ntorture was committed (whether such act was committed at home in state A or abroad). State A \n\nis, in short, the responsible state, and it must ensure proper civil redress. Article 14(1) is not \n\ndesigned to require every other state (state B) to provide redress in its civil legal system for \n\nacts of torture committed in state A, although under article 14(2) it remains permissible for \n\nstate B to provide redress in state B for acts of torture committed (either in state A or \n\nelsewhere) by officials, etc. of state A.\u2019283  \n\n \n\nHaving held that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was entitled to immunity, Lord \n\nJustice Mance moved to the question of whether immunity should extend to the acts and \n\nomissions amounting to torture of the individual defendants, who were ordinary state \n\nofficials.284 As pointed out by him, a state\u2019s claim to immunity ratione materiae with \n\nrespect to a claim against its officials differs from the immunity ratione personae of the \n\nstate itself.285 One of the crucial issues discussed by Lord Justice Mance was the assertion \n\nof the Court of Appeal in Propend that \n\n \n\u2018The protection afforded by the [State Immunity] Act of 1978 to States would be undermined if \n\nemployees, officers (or as one authority puts it, \u201cfunctionaries\u201d) could be sued as individuals \n\nfor matters of State conduct in respect of which the State they were serving had immunity. \n\nSection 14(1) [of the SIA 1978] must be read as affording to individual employees or officers \n\nof a foreign State protection under the same cloak as protects the State itself.\u2019286 \n\n \n\nLord Justice Mance remarked that the SIA makes no reference to individual \n\nofficials of the state\u2014under Section 14.1 of the SIA, references to \u2018state\u2019 in the statute \n\ninclude \u2018the sovereign or other head of that state in his public capacity\u2019, \u2018the government \n\nof that state\u2019 and \u2018any department of that government\u2019.287 As observed by Hazel Fox and \n\n                                                \n282 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 659.  \n283 ibid. \n284 ibid 662. \n285 ibid 695-696. \n286 Propend Finance Pty Limited and Others v Sing and Others [1997] 111 ILR 611 (Court of Appeal), 669. \n287 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 663-664 and 668. As \nregards Section 14.2 of the SIA, which deals with \u2018separate entities\u2019, Lord Justice Mance recalled that the \n\n\n\n104  \n\nPhilippa Webb, it seems that His Lordship took the position that Section 14.1 deals with \n\nimmunity ratione personae, but, if it applied to immunity ratione materiae, it should be \n\nread as not including conducts which are outside the scope of the proper exercise of \n\nsovereignty, such as international crimes.288 Lord Justice Mance asserted that, in spite of it \n\nbeing defined by Article 1 of the CAT as an act \u2018by or at the instigation of or with the \n\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official \n\ncapacity\u2019289, torture did not fall in the scope of immunity ratione materiae:  \n\n \n\u2018It seems doubtful that the phrase \u201cacting in an official capacity\u201d qualifies the reference to \u201ca \n\npublic official\u201d. The types of purpose for which any pain or suffering must be inflicted \u2026 \n\nwould appear to represent a sufficient limitation in the case of a public official. Be that as it \n\nmay, the requirement that the pain or suffering be inflicted by a public official does no more in \n\nmy view than identify the author and the public context in which the author must be acting. It \n\ndoes not lend to the acts of torture themselves any official or governmental character or nature, \n\n                                                                                                                                              \nCourt of Appeal in Propend had considered it not to be relevant in respect of individual functionaries. See \nPropend (n 286) 670 (footnote omitted): \n \n\n\u2018The concept of an \u201centity \u2026 distinct from the executive organs of the government of the State \nand capable of suing or being sued\u201d is not one which would normally be identified with an \nindividual or natural person. Its background and history suggest that the concept was \nintroduced to address the problem presented by artificial legal entities exercising public \nfunctions. Lord Goff in the Kuwait Airways case \u2026 pointed out that the language makes it \nprobable that the section has in mind entities \u201cof\u201d or, in other words, created by the State in \nquestion. Where such an artificial entity exists and is entitled to immunity, then its servants or \nofficers would of course benefit by immunity in similar fashion to the officers or functionaries \nof a State entitled to immunity. Further, an individual might possess status as a corporation \nsole or similar status which could constitute him in that capacity a \u201cseparate entity\u201d for the \npurposes of Section 14.\u2019 \n\n \n288 Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb, The Law of State Immunity (3rd edn, OUP 2013) 182-184. See Lord \nMance, Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 663-664: \n \n\n\u2018Section 14(1) on its face reflects the personal immunity that those identified would, apart from \nit, enjoy under both international and common law. If, which I doubt, it goes in its express \nterms any further, they must, on any view, be read subject to qualification to reflect the \ndistinction between personal and subject-matter immunity.\u2019 \n\n \nHazel Fox and Philippa Webb added that, in the same judgment, Lord Phillips interpreted Section 14.1 as \nreferring to immunity ratione materiae. In any case, he also understood that conducts like torture were \noutside the scope of immunity ratione materiae. See Lord Phillips, Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 711: \n \n\n\u2018That principle [established in Propend] has no application if (i) the state\u2019s immunity is not \u201cin \nrespect of conduct\u201d but is ratione personae and (ii) the subject matter of the action does not \nrank as \u201cmatters of state conduct\u201d. That is the position in the present case and, for that reason, \nthe Propend case does not establish that state immunity attaches to the claims against the \nindividual defendants.\u2019 \n\n \n289 Convention Against Torture (n 277). \n\n\n\n105  \n\nor mean that it can in any way be regarded as an official function to inflict, or that an official \n\ncan be regarded as representing the state in inflicting, such pain or suffering. Still less does it \n\nsuggest that the official inflicting such pain or suffering can be afforded the cloak of state \n\nimmunity. \u2026 The whole tenor of the Torture Convention is to underline the individual \n\nresponsibility of state officials for acts of torture \u2026 and I do not consider that one can derive \n\nfrom its definition of torture \u201cfor the purposes of the Convention\u201d any conclusion on the \n\ndifferent question whether a state can assert state immunity in respect of a civil claim against \n\nits officials based on allegations of systematic torture.\u2019290  \n\n \n\nLord Justice Mance emphasized that, after the House of Lords\u2019 judgment in Ex \n\nparte Pinochet (No 3), which related to criminal proceedings against a former head of \n\nstate, the issue of civil jurisdiction should be considered under a new light.291 Taking this \n\ninto account, His Lordship made some considerations. Firstly, he could not see how civil \n\nproceedings against an alleged torturer would involve a greater degree of interference in \n\nthe domestic affairs of a state when compared to criminal proceedings\u2014also, there would \n\nbe \u2018\u2026 no basis on which the state could be made liable to indemnify one of its officials \n\nproved to have committed systematic torture\u2019.292 Secondly, Lord Justice Mance referred to \n\nthe \u2018obvious potential for anomalies\u2019 if the provisions of the CAT on international criminal \n\njurisdiction are not matched \u2018\u2026 by some wider parallel power to adjudicate over civil \n\nclaims\u2019\u2014it would be, according to him, incongruous that \u2018if the alleged torturer was \n\nactually within and being prosecuted in the jurisdiction of the forum State pursuant to \n\nArticle 5(2) of the Torture Convention \u2026 no immunity could be claimed, [but] the \n\nvictim(s) of the alleged torture would be unable to pursue any civil claim.\u2019293 Thirdly, he \n\nargued criminal proceedings have \u2018a higher onus and evidential difficulties\u2019 and states may \n\nhave reasons to pursue or not criminal proceedings, and that makes civil proceedings \n\nvaluable not only because of the potential financial recovery for the victims, but also in the \n\nprocess of truth-finding, rehabilitation and closure.294 Finally, he considered that the \n\ndifficulties regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction and execution would not justify \u2018\u2026 the \n\npossession by the foreign state of a blanket claim to immunity in respect of such an official \n\nor agent in a case of alleged systematic torture.\u2019295 \n\n                                                \n290 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 688-689. \n291 ibid 690-691.  \n292 ibid 691. \n293 ibid 692-693. \n294 ibid 693. \n295 ibid 695. \n\n\n\n106  \n\nLord Justice Mance considered the impact of Article 6 of the ECHR on civil \n\nimmunity. Having already concluded that, in the light of the ECtHR\u2019s judgment in Al-\n\nAdsani v United Kingdom, the grant of immunity to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia did not \n\ninfringe Article 6 of the ECHR, Lord Justice Mance assessed the impact of the same \n\nprovision on the different issue of immunity ratione materiae of state officials. He found \n\nthat, unlike in respect of the immunity ratione personae of the state itself and the immunity \n\nratione materiae of state officials for misconducts that not amount to international crimes, \n\n\u2018there [was] no settled practice in relation to serious international crimes \u2026\u2019.296 Lord \n\nJustice Mance asserted it would be disproportionate to simply guarantee a blanket \n\nimmunity for state officials who allegedly committed acts of systematic torture.297 He \n\nreasoned as follows. Under Article 14 of the CAT states have to \u2018\u2026 ensure in its legal \n\nsystem that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to \n\nfair and adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible\u2019. \n\nIf the state where the torture occurred or by whose official the torture was committed \n\nprovided an adequate and effective domestic remedy, other states would be expected to \n\nabstain from exercising jurisdiction over the matter. In Lord Justice Mance\u2019s view, in the \n\nabsence of such remedy, it could be disproportionate for other states to simply maintain a \n\nblanket immunity in respect of civil proceedings.298 Lord Justice Mance added that, under \n\nthe Human Rights Act, inasmuch as possible, primary legislation, like the SIA 1978, has to \n\nbe read and applied in a way which is compatible with the ECHR, and that \n\n \n\u2018[t]here is nothing in the 1978 Act [the SIA] which expressly covers the civil liability of state \n\nofficials against whom conduct is alleged constituting serious international crime. The gap \n\ncannot be filled by a simple assertion that the immunity possessed by a state should be mirrored \n\n                                                \n296 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 696. \n297 ibid 696-697. Emphasizing once again the difference between a claim against the state itself and a claim \nagainst state officials, Lord Justice Mance remarked that, \n \n\n\u2018[a]lthough torture by one of its officials is a matter for which a state may be made civilly \nresponsible under article 14(1), any claim to enforce that responsibility must be pursued in the \nstate in question (or in an international forum), otherwise state immunity will still bar it. But, if \nclaims against officials committing torture in the official capacity can be pursued elsewhere, \nthe state will not be impleaded in any direct sense, and will not be obliged to indemnify any \nofficial or agent found to have committed systematic torture. Insofar as there may be said that \nthere is interference in a foreign state\u2019s domestic affairs or that a foreign state is being \nindirectly impleaded, this would occur in civil proceedings in respects no more far-reaching \nthan those already permitted in criminal proceedings under the Torture Convention or (on one \nview) under more general international legal principles.\u2019 \n\n \n298 ibid.  \n\n\n\n107  \n\nby an immunity possessed by the official whose act or omission has given rise to the state's \n\nimmunity. \u2026 \n\n \u2018\u2026 [I]t can no longer be appropriate give blanket effect to a foreign state\u2019s claim to state \n\nimmunity ratione materiae in respect of a state official alleged to have committed acts of \n\nsystematic torture. To do so could deprive the right of access to a court under article 6 [of the \n\nECHR] of real meaning in a case where the victim of torture had no prospect of recourse in the \n\nstate whose officials committed the torture.\u2019299  \n\n \n\nLord Justice Mance allowed the claimants\u2019 appeal in respect of the individual \n\ndefendants: \n\n \n\u2018I would however conclude ... that, even apart from the Human Rights Convention, a foreign \n\nstate cannot possess (either under international law or under English common law and the \n\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s 1978 Act) any absolute right to claim immunity in respect of civil claims \n\nagainst its officials for systematic torture, even committed outside the country of suit. Further, \n\nin a jurisdiction like the English I would consider that it should be possible to cater for any \n\nconcerns about the exercise of jurisdiction in respect of such claims by appropriate use or \n\ndevelopment of discretionary principles relating to the exercise of jurisdiction. But, even if that \n\nwere not so either here or elsewhere, it seems to me that any absolute view of immunity must \n\nat the very least yield in the face of assertions of systematic torture to a more nuanced or \n\nproportionate approach. As it is, having regard to the [ECHR], it is sufficient to decide this \n\nappeal that, whether issues of state immunity are or are not treated as theoretically separate \n\nfrom issues of jurisdiction in English law, the permissibility, appropriateness and \n\nproportionality of exercising jurisdiction ought to be determined at one and the same time. \n\nSuch a conclusion reflects the importance attaching in today\u2019s world and in current \n\ninternational thinking and jurisprudence to the recognition and effective enforcement of \n\nindividual human rights. It fits harmoniously with the position already achieved in relation to \n\ncriminal proceedings. It caters for our obligation under article 6 of the European Convention \n\non Human Rights not to deny access to our courts, in circumstances where it would otherwise \n\nbe appropriate to exercise jurisdiction applying domestic jurisdictional principles, unless to do \n\nso would be in pursuit of a legitimate aim and proportionate. It also caters for all legitimate \n\nconsiderations, arising from the special position of states and the delicacy of suits indirectly \n\n                                                \n299 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 698-699. Human \nRights Act 1989&lt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents> accessed 26 November 2015: \n \n\n\u20183\u2014Interpretation of legislation \n\u2018(1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be \nread and given effect in a way which is compatible with the [ECHR]. \n\u2018\u2026\u2019 \n\n\n\n108  \n\ninvolving them and their affairs. It does so by allowing ample scope for the sensitive handling \n\nof claims such as the present which is unquestionably necessary. ...\u2019300 \n\n \n\nLord Phillips agreed with Lord Justice Mance\u2019s conclusions. He shared the view \n\nthat the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was entitled to immunity, in conformity with what had \n\nbeen established in Al-Adsani v Government and Kuwait (Court of Appeal) and in Al-\n\nAdsani v United Kingdom (ECtHR).301 Accordingly, Lord Phillips also held there is a \n\ndistinction between the immunity ratione personae of the state itself and the immunity \n\nratione materiae of state officials. The latter issue was not the subject-matter of the Al-\n\nAdsani case. As recalled by Lord Phillips, the majority of the House of Lords in Ex parte \n\nPinochet (No 3) had considered that the acts of torture with which Pinochet had been \n\ncharged could not be considered official acts and attract immunity ratione materiae in \n\nrelation to criminal proceedings, since such conduct was a violation of jus cogens. Lord \n\nPhillips considered there would be no reason to afford individuals immunity for acts of \n\ntorture in respect of criminal proceedings and not do the same in respect of civil \n\nproceedings: \n\n \n\u2018Once the conclusion is reached that torture cannot be treated as the exercise of a state function \n\nso as to attract immunity ratione materiae in criminal proceedings against individuals, it seems \n\nto me that it cannot logically be so treated in civil proceedings against individuals.302 \n\n\u2018\u2026 If civil proceedings are brought against individuals for acts of torture in circumstances \n\nwhere the state is immune from suit ratione personae, there can be no suggestion that the state \n\nis vicariously liable. It is the personal responsibility of the individuals, not that of the state, \n\nwhich is in issue. The state is not indirectly impleaded by the proceedings.\u2019303  \n\n \n\nLord Phillips argued the ECtHR would reach the same conclusion if confronted \n\nwith this matter: \n\n \n\u2018Had the Grand Chamber been considering a claim for state immunity in relation to claims \n\nbrought against individuals, I do not believe that there would have been a majority in favour of \n\nthe view that this represented a legitimate limitation on the right to access to a court under \n\nArticle 6(1). Had the Court shared the conclusions that we have reached on this appeal, it \n\nwould have held that there was no recognised rule of public international law that conferred \n\n                                                \n300 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 701-702.  \n301 ibid 703-704.  \n302 ibid 709-710. \n303 ibid 710. \n\n\n\n109  \n\nsuch immunity. Had it concluded that there was such a rule, I consider that it would have been \n\nlikely to have held that it would not be proportionate to apply the rule so as to preclude civil \n\nremedies sought against individuals.\u2019304 \n\n \n\n3.1.7.2.3 Judgment of the House of Lords (2006) \n\n \n\nThe case reached the House of Lords. The claimants appealed against the grant of \n\nimmunity to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whilst the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appealed \n\nagainst the decision regarding the state officials.  \n\nLord Bingham considered the relationship between two principles of international \n\nlaw was the crux of the legal dispute: \n\n \n\u2018One principle, historically the older of the two, is that one sovereign state will not, save in \n\ncertain specified instances, assert its judicial authority over another.  The second principle, of \n\nmore recent vintage but of the highest authority among principles of international law, is one \n\nthat condemns and criminalises the official practice of torture, requires states to suppress the \n\npractice and provides for the trial and punishment of officials found to be guilty of it. \u2026 The \n\nHouse [of Lords] must consider the balance currently struck in international law [between these \n\ntwo principles] \u2026\u2019 305  \n\n \n\nLord Bingham observed that the logic of the international instruments (the ECSI \n\nand the UNCJISP) and of the various domestic statutes on state immunity was to establish \n\nimmunity as a general rule and to specify a number of exceptions to this rule. He argued \n\nthat, although the SIA 1978 does not have a specific provision governing immunity in \n\nrespect of claims brought against officials of a foreign state for acts they practiced in the \n\nforeign state, there was a \u2018\u2026 wealth of authority to show that in such case the foreign state \n\nis entitled to claim immunity for its servants as it could if sued itself. The foreign state\u2019s \n\nright to immunity cannot be circumvented by suing its servants or agents.\u2019306  \n\nLord Bingham added the UNCJISP addressed this issue and in its Article 2.1.b.iv it \n\nwas established that \u2018representatives of the State acting in that capacity\u2019 were comprised in \n\nthe definition of state. Accordingly, Article 6.2.b provides that  \n\n \n\n                                                \n304 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 712. \n305 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another; Mitchell and others v Al-\nDali and others [2007] 129 ILR 713 (House of Lords), 713-714. \n306 ibid 717. \n\n\n\n110  \n\n\u2018\u2026 [a] proceeding before a court of a State shall be considered to have been instituted against \n\nanother State if that other State \u2026 is not named as a party to the proceeding but the proceeding \n\nin effect seeks to affect the property, rights, interests or activities of that other State.\u2019307  \n\n \n\nUnlike what was ruled by the Court of Appeal, to Lord Bingham, the conduct of the \n\ndefendants was undoubtedly in discharge or purported discharge of their public duties.308 \n\nLord Bingham considered that any act attributable to the state for the purpose of state \n\nresponsibility is an \u2018official act\u2019 for the purpose of immunity ratione materiae of state \n\nofficials.309 Therefore, immunity could not be refused on the grounds of the unlawfulness \n\nof a given conduct: \n \n\n\u2018International law does not require, as a condition of a state\u2019s entitlement to claim immunity \n\nfor the conduct of its servant or agent, that the latter should have been acting in accordance \n\nwith his instructions or authority. A state may claim immunity for any act for which it is, in \n\ninternational law, responsible, save where an established exception applies. \n\n\u2018\u2026 The fact that conduct is unlawful or objectionable is not, of itself, a ground for refusing \n\nimmunity.\u2019310 \n\n \n\nLord Bingham asserted that a \u2018straightforward\u2019 application of the SIA would lead \n\nto the conclusion that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its officials were entitled to \n\nimmunity, insofar as the cases brought to the attention of the Court did not fall under the \n                                                \n307 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property (adopted 2 \nDecember 2004, not yet entered into force) (2005) 44 ILM 803. \n308 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 718. \n309 ibid 718-719. Lord Bingham relied on Articles 4 and 7 of the DARSIWA 2001 to convey this point. \nOddly, he did not refer to Article 58 of the DARSIWA, which states that the articles \u2018\u2026 are without \nprejudice to any question of the individual responsibility under international law of any person acting on \nbehalf of a State.\u2019 ILC, \u2018Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with \ncommentaries\u2019 (2001)&lt;legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf> accessed 26 \nNovember 2015:  \n \n\n\u2018Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State \n\u20181. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international \nlaw, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, \nwhatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an \norgan of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. \n\u20182. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal \nlaw of the State.\u2019 \n \n \u2018Article 7.

Nevertheless, Lord Bingham decided to accept the ruling of the \n\nECtHR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom, which had held Article 6 to be engaged. In the \n\njurisprudence of the ECtHR, any limitation to the right of access to court must pursue a \n\nlegitimate aim and be proportionate. The claimants contended that the grant of immunity in \n\nthe case did not fulfill these requirements, insofar as it would result in an inconsistency \n\nwith the jus cogens norm of prohibition of torture. Furthermore, as previously discussed, \n\nthey had argued torture could not be considered an official act entitled to immunity ratione \n\nmateriae.  \n\nLord Bingham disagreed with the submission of the claimants in this regard, which \n\nhad been previously upheld in the Court of Appeal: \n\n \n\u2018It is, I think, difficult to accept that torture cannot be a governmental or official act, since \n\nunder article 1 of the Torture Convention torture must, to qualify as such, be inflicted by or \n\nwith the connivance of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. The \n\nclaimants\u2019 argument encounters the difficulty that it is founded on the Torture Convention; but \n\nto bring themselves within the Torture Convention they must show that the torture was (to \n\nparaphrase the definition) official; yet they argue that the conduct was not official in order to \n\ndefeat the claim to immunity.\u2019314 \n \n\n                                                \n311 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 720. \n312 Human Rights Act 1989 (n 299). \n313 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 720. \n314 ibid 724. \n\n\n\n112  \n\nThe claimants had referred to the practice of US courts not to recognize violations \n\nof jus cogens as official acts for the purposes of immunity of state officials. Lord Bingham \n\nconsidered that the position of the US courts in this matter was not relevant because it was \n\nnot shared by other states. In order to support this point, Lord Bingham referred to the \n\nfollowing excerpt of the joint separate opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans and \n\nBuergenthal annexed to the ICJ\u2019s judgment in the Arrest Warrant case: \n \n\n\u2018The contemporary trends, reflecting international relations as they stand at the beginning of \n\nthe new century, are striking. The movement is towards bases of jurisdiction other than \n\nterritoriality. \u201cEffects\u201d or \u201cimpact\u201d jurisdiction is embraced both by the United States and, with \n\ncertain qualifications, by the European Union. Passive personality jurisdiction, for so long \n\nregarded as controversial, is now reflected not only in the legislation of various countries (the \n\nUnited States, Ch. 113A, 1986 Omnibus Diplomatic and Antiterrorism Act; France, Art. 689, \n\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1975), and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so \n\nfar as a particular category of offences is concerned. \n\n\u2018In civil matters we already see the beginnings of a very broad form of extraterritorial \n\njurisdiction. Under the Alien Tort Claims Act, the United States, basing itself on a law of 1789, \n\nhas asserted a jurisdiction both over human rights violations and over major violations of \n\ninternational law, perpetrated by non-nationals overseas. Such jurisdiction, with the possibility \n\nof ordering payment of damages, has been exercised with respect to torture committed in a \n\nvariety of countries (Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Guatemala), and with respect to other major \n\nhuman rights violations in yet other countries. While this unilateral exercise of the function of \n\nguardian of international values has been much commented on, it has not attracted the \n\napprobation of States generally.\u2019315 \n\n \n\nThe reference of the claimants to the decision of the Italian Court of Cassation in \n\nFerrini was not successful either. As previously discussed, in Ferrini, the Court of \n\nCassation expressed its disapproval of the ECtHR\u2019s judgment in Al-Adsani v United \n\nKingdom and of the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario\u2019s judgment in Bouzari v Islamic \n\nRepublic of Iran. According to the Italian Court of Cassation, since jus cogens norms are \n\nhierarchically superior and the emergence of the principle of respect to fundamental human \n\nrights as a fundamental principle of the international legal order impacted upon the scope \n\nof the principle of sovereign equality, the argument that there was not an explicit norm \n\nproviding for a jus cogens exception to state immunity could not carry the day. Lord \n\n                                                \n315 Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Belgium) (Joint Separate Opinion \nof Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal) [2002] ICJ Rep 3, [47]-[48] (emphasis added); Jones v \nMinistry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 726-727. \n\n\n\n113  \n\nBingham criticized the assertion of the Court of Cassation according to which the principle \n\nof universal jurisdiction applied to civil actions arising from international crimes.316 He \n\nconsidered that the judgment of the Court of Cassation in Ferrini was not \u2018an accurate \n\nstatement of international law as generally understood\u2019\u2014in his words, \u2018one swallow does \n\nnot make a rule of international law.\u2019317  \n\nLord Bingham also understood that Article 14 of the CAT did not provide for \n\nuniversal civil jurisdiction in respect of acts of torture not committed in the state of the \n\nforum. The claimants had referred to a commentary of the Committee against Torture in \n\nresponse to the periodic report submitted by Canada. The Committee recommended that \n\nCanada \u2018should review its position under article 14 of the Convention to ensure the \n\nprovision of compensation through its civil jurisdiction to all victims of torture.\u2019318 Lord \n\nBingham argued this recommendation was not binding in international law. 319  His \n\nLordship also referred to the declaration made by the US in respect of Article 14 of the \n\nCAT, according to which Article 14 \u2018\u2026 requires a State Party to provide a private right of \n\naction for damages only for acts of torture committed in territory under the jurisdiction of \n\nthat State Party.\u2019320 \n\n                                                \n316 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 725. \n317 ibid. \n318 UN Committee Against Torture, \u2018Considerations of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 19 \nof the Convention, Conclusions and recommendations of the Committee against Torture: Canada\u2019 (7 July \n2005) CAT/C/CR/34/CAN. In \u2018General Comment No 3\u2019 (13 December 2012) CAT/C/GC/3, the Committee \nAgainst Torture reiterated the understanding that Article 14 requires States parties to provided universal civil \njurisdiction in the following terms:  \n \n\n\u201822. \u2026 The Committee considers that the application of article 14 is not limited to victims who \nwere harmed in the territory of the State party or by or against nationals of the State party. The \nCommittee has commended the efforts of States parties for providing civil remedies for victims \nwho were subjected to torture or ill-treatment outside their territory. This is particularly \nimportant when a victim is unable to exercise the rights guaranteed under article 14 in the \nterritory where the violation took place. Indeed, article 14 requires States parties to ensure that \nall victims of torture and ill-treatment are able to access remedy and obtain redress. \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u201842. \u2026 [G]ranting immunity, in violation of international law, to any State or its agents or to \nnon-State actors for torture or ill-treatment, is in direct conflict with the obligation of providing \nredress to victims. When impunity is allowed by law or exists de facto, it bars victims from \nseeking full redress as it allows the violators to go unpunished and denies victims full \nassurance of their rights under article 14. The Committee affirms that under no circumstances \nmay arguments of national security be used to deny redress for victims.\u2019  \n\n \n319 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 726. \n320 Reservations to the Convention Against Torture  \n<https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=treaty&amp;mtdsg_no=iv-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en#EndDec> \naccessed 26 November 2015. \n\n\n\n114  \n\nOn the other hand, Lord Bingham found the four arguments put forth by the \n\ndefendants \u2018cumulatively irresistible\u2019.321 Firstly, the ICJ in the Arrest Warrant case did not \n\nfind any exception under customary international law to the rule according immunity from \n\ncriminal jurisdiction to incumbent Foreign Ministers, even in cases in which they are \n\nsuspected of having committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. Logically, as put \n\nby Lord Bingham, it should follow that prohibitions of this character do not automatically \n\nprevail over other rules of international law. Moreover, the ICJ in Armed Activities on the \n\nTerritory of the Congo concluded that \u2018\u2026 the fact that a dispute relates to compliance with \n\na norm having [a jus cogens character] \u2026 cannot of itself provide a basis for the \n\njurisdiction of the Court to entertain that dispute\u2019322. Secondly, he agreed that Article 14 of \n\nthe CAT did not provide for universal civil jurisdiction.323 Thirdly, the UNCJISP did not \n\nprovide for an exception from immunity in respect of civil claims based on violations of \n\njus cogens.324 Finally, it was contended that an obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction \n\nover claims arising from breaches of jus cogen had not yet emerged in international law.325 \n\nBased on these considerations, Lord Bingham found the SIA was \u2018\u2026 not shown to be \n\ndisproportionate as inconsistent with a peremptory norm of international law, and its \n\napplication [did] not infringe the claimants\u2019 right under article 6\u2019.326  \n\nLord Bingham concluded the claims against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the \n\nindividual defendants should have been dismissed\u2014in his opinion, the Court of Appeal \n\nerred in law when it found the individual defendants were not entitled to immunity and \n\nasserted \u2018a universal tort jurisdiction in cases of official torture \u2026 for which there was no \n\nadequate foundation in any international convention, state practice and scholarly \n\nconsensus\u2019327.  \n\nLord Hoffmann concurred with the judgment of Lord Bingham, further developing \n\na few points. He did not accept there was a conflict between the jus cogens norm of \n\nprohibition of torture and a rule that accords immunity: \n\n \n\n                                                \n321 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 726. \n322 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the \nCongo v. Rwanda) (Merits: Judgment) [2006] ICJ Rep 6, [64]. \n323 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 727.  \n324 ibid. \n325 ibid. \n326 ibid. \n327 ibid 730. \n\n\n\n115  \n\n\u2018The jus cogens is the prohibition on torture. But the United Kingdom, in according state \n\nimmunity to the Kingdom, is not proposing to torture anyone. Nor is the Kingdom, in claiming \n\nimmunity, justifying the use of torture. It is objecting in limine to the jurisdiction of the \n\nEnglish court to decide whether it used torture or not. \u2026 \n\n\u2018\u2026 To produce a conflict with state immunity, it is therefore necessary to show that the \n\nprohibition on torture has generated an ancillary procedural rule which, by way of exception to \n\nstate immunity, entitles or perhaps requires states to assume civil jurisdiction over other states \n\nin cases in which torture is alleged. Such a rule may be desirable and, since international law \n\nchanges, may have developed. But, contrary to the assertion of the minority in Al-Adsani, it is \n\nnot entailed by the prohibition of torture.\u2019328 \n\n \n\nIn further examining the relationship between jus cogens and state immunity, Lord \n\nHoffmann criticized the decision of the Greek Court of Cassation in Prefecture of Voiotia v \n\nFederal Republic of Germany: \n\n \n\u2018The decision of the Greek Court of Cassation in Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of \n\nGermany, 4 May 2000 \u2026 went upon a theory of implied waiver which has received no support \n\nin other decisions. It was undermined by the court\u2019s own refusal to order enforcement of the \n\njudgment and held to be wrong by a judgment of a special Supreme Court (the Anotato Eidiko \n\nDikasterio) convened to decide cases involving the interpretation of international law: \n\nMargellos v Federal Republic of Germany \u2026 17 September 2002. The original judgment was \n\ncoldly received by the German Supreme Court when the claimants attempted to enforce it \n\ndirectly in Germany: Greek Citizens v Federal Republic of Germany (The Distomo Massacre \n\nCase) (2003) \u2026\u2019329 \n\n \n\nLord Hoffmann\u2019s criticism of the decision of the Italian Court of Cassation in the \n\nFerrini case was even sharper. According to him, the Italian Court of Cassation exhibited \n\n\u2018the same bare syllogistic reasoning as the judgment of the minority in Al-Adsani.\u2019330 In a \n\nvery interesting passage, Lord Hoffmann discusses the interpretation Pasquale de Sena and \n\nFrancesca de Vittor gave to the Ferrini case, according to which the systematic approach \n\nadopted by the Italian Court of Cassation should be seen as giving primacy to the value of \n\nhuman rights over the value of sovereign immunity as a result of the balancing of these \n\n                                                \n328 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 732. \n329 ibid 738. \n330 ibid.  \n\n\n\n116  \n\ntwo fundamental principles of the international legal system.331 Lord Hoffmann argued that \n\nthis technique was unacceptable in international law: \n\n \n\u2018I think that [\u2018giving priority to the values embodied in the prohibition of torture over the \n\nvalues and policies of the rules of state immunity\u2019] is a fair interpretation of what the court was \n\ndoing and, if the case had been concerned with domestic law, might have been regarded by \n\nsome as \u201cactivist\u201d but would have been well within the judicial function. As Professor \n\nDworkin demonstrated in Law\u2019s Empire (1986), the ordering of competing principles \n\naccording to the importance of the values which they embody is a basic technique of \n\nadjudication. But the same approach cannot be adopted in international law, which is based \n\nupon the common consent of nations. It is not for a national court to \u201cdevelop\u201d international \n\nlaw by unilaterally adopting a version of that law which, however desirable, forward-looking \n\nand reflective of values it may be, is simply not accepted by other states.\u2019332 \n\n \n\nOn the matter of the immunity of the individual defendants, Lord Hoffmann, \n\nfollowing Lord Bingham, understood that \u2018as a matter of international law, the same \n\nimmunity against suit in a foreign domestic court which protects the state itself also \n\nprotects the individual for whom the state is responsible\u2019. 333  The terms \u2018state\u2019 and \n\n\u2018government\u2019 in the SIA should, according to him, be understood as including state \n\nofficials acting in that capacity, as a corollary of the principle that the SIA must be \n\n\u2018construed against the background of those principles of public international law as are \n\ngenerally recognised by the family of nations\u2019334. In his view, although the CAT withdrew \n\nimmunity in respect of criminal proceedings, it did not affect immunity for civil \n\nproceedings.335 Lord Hoffmann also agreed with Lord Bingham that an act attributable to \n\nthe state for the purposes of international responsibility is an \u2018official act\u2019 for the purposes \n\nof immunity:  \n\n \n\u2018It seems thus clear that a state will incur responsibility in international law if one of its \n\nofficials, under colour of his authority, tortures a national of another state, even though the acts \n\nwere unlawful and unauthorised. To hold that for the purposes of state immunity he was not \n\nacting in an official capacity would produce an asymmetry between the rules of liability and \n\nimmunity. \n\n                                                \n331 Pasquale de Sena and Francesca de Vittor, \u2018State Immunity and Human Rights: the Italian Supreme Court \non the Ferrini Case\u2019 (2005) 16(1) EJIL 89.  \n332 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 738-739.  \n333 ibid 739. \n334 ibid 741.

Mr Houshang Bouzari, \n\nan Iranian national, who had been an advisor to the Minister of Petroleum and the state \n\nowned National Iranian Oil Company, left the Iranian government in 1987 to found his \n\nown consulting company.338 He eventually helped secure a deal between a consortium of \n\ncompanies seeking to engage in an oil and gas project in the Persian Gulf and the National \n\nIranian Oil Company.339 Said consortium was to be paid $1.8 billion and Mr Bouzari\u2019s \n\ncommission was to be two per cent of this amount.340 Mr Bouzari was approached by the \n\nsecond son of the President of Iran, who offered his father\u2019s help in guaranteeing the \n\ncontract and demanded $50 million in return.341 Mr Bouzari alleged that, following his \n\nrefusal to accept the assistance offered, he was kidnapped, imprisoned and repeatedly \n\ntortured in Tehran.342  \n\n                                                \n336 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 305) 743. \n337 ibid 744.  \n338 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran [2004] CanLII 871 (Court of Appeal for Ontario), [8]-[9]. \n339 ibid [8]-[9]. \n340 ibid [10]. \n341 ibid. \n342 ibid [11]-[12]. \n\n\n\n118  \n\nMr Bouzari fled to Canada, where he brought suit against Iran for the damages \n\nsuffered. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice declared it had no jurisdiction to entertain \n\nthe claim. The ruling was confirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, whose \n\njudgment was delivered by Justice Goudge.343 \n\nMr Bouzari alleged that, since torture was prohibited by a jus cogens norm, there \n\nwas universal civil jurisdiction for him to bring his claim before the court.344 Justice \n\nGoudge asserted there was nothing in the SIA 1985 or in any treaty binding on Canada \n\nwhich would require the application of universal jurisdiction.345 He also found there was \n\nnothing in customary international law requiring states to exercise civil jurisdiction for \n\nclaims arising from torture suffered abroad.346 In any case, Justice Goudge considered it \n\nwas not necessary to find whether the court had jurisdiction by applying the ordinary test \n\nof real and substantial connection, because the issue of state immunity precluded the \n\nquestion.347  \n\nJustice Goudge expressed a very orthodox view on state immunity. He considered \n\nit to be \u2018founded on the concepts of the sovereign equality of states and the non-\n\ninterference of states in the internal affairs of each other\u2019 and \u2018rooted on customary \n\ninternational law\u2019.348 He also considered immunity was once absolute but the \u2018dictates of \n\njustice\u2019 had led to its attenuation.349   \n\nIn Canada, state immunity is governed by a statute, the SIA 1985, which \n\nestablishes immunity as a general rule subject to the exceptions enshrined in the Act itself.  \n\nMr Bouzari relied on three exceptions provided for in the SIA.  \n\nFirstly, Section 18 of the Act provides that it \u2018\u2026 does not apply to criminal \n\nproceedings or proceedings in the nature of criminal proceedings.\u2019350 Mr Bouzari alleged \n\nthat this exception to state immunity applied because he was seeking punitive damages, \n\nwhich have the nature of a fine. Justice Goudge rejected this argument and asserted that \n\npunitive damages, whilst having the objective of deterring conduct, are a civil remedy. 351  \n\nSecondly, Mr Bouzari invoked the exception for torts committed in the forum state, \n\nenshrined in the SIA. Indeed, Section 6 of the Act provides that \u2018[a] foreign state is not \n                                                \n343 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran (n 338) [18]-[20]. \n344 ibid [23]. \n345 ibid [28]. \n346 ibid. \n347 ibid [38]. \n348 ibid [40]. \n349 ibid [41].  \n350 State Immunity Act 1985&lt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-18/> accessed 26 November 2015. \n351 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran (n 338) [44]. \n\n\n\n119  \n\nimmune from the jurisdiction of a court in any proceedings that relate to (a) any death or \n\npersonal or bodily injury, or (b) any damage to or loss of property that occurs in \n\nCanada.\u2019352 Mr Bouzari alleged that his suffering continued in Canada. Justice Goudge \n\nconsidered that the continued suffering of Mr Bouzari was due to the injuries inflicted in \n\nIran, not in Canada, and rejected the argument.353 \n\nThirdly, Mr Bouzari relied on the exception relating to commercial activity, found \n\nin Section 5 of the SIA, according to which \u2018[a] foreign state is not immune from the \n\njurisdiction of a court in any proceedings that relate to any commercial activity of the \n\nforeign state.\u2019354 The act defines commercial activity as \u2018any particular transaction, act or \n\nconduct or any regular course of conduct that by reason of its nature is of a commercial \n\ncharacter.\u2019355 Mr Bouzari claimed the acts of torture he suffered were committed with the \n\npurpose of affecting his involvement in a commercial activity. Justice Goudge did not \n\naccept this contention and asserted that the acts of torture were not commercial in nature, \n\nand that it was not enough that the claim related to \u2018\u2026 acts which, in turn, relate to \n\ncommercial activity of the foreign state.\u2019356 \n\nJustice Goudge also held the SIA was a comprehensive code, and thus the \n\nargument that, under common law, torture could not be considered a government act and \n\ncould not attract immunity was dismissed.357  \n\nJustice Goudge then turned to the question of whether Canada was bound by \n\ninternational law to allow for a civil remedy in the case. He considered that, as far as \n\npossible, domestic legislation should be interpreted consistently with international law (be \n\nit customary or conventional law).358 At the same time, he found that domestic law prevails \n\nwhen it conflicts with international law.359 As a consequence, he concluded that  \n\n \n\u2018[e]ven if Canada\u2019s international law obligations required that Canada permit a civil remedy \n\nfor torture abroad by a foreign state, Canada has legislated in a way that does not do so. \n\nSection 3 of the SIA accords complete state immunity except as provided by the SIA. And, as \n\nwe have seen, none of the relevant exceptions in the SIA permits a civil claim against a foreign \n\n                                                \n352 State Immunity Act 1985 (n 350). \n353 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran (n 338) [46]-[47]. \n354 State Immunity Act 1985 (n 350). \n355 ibid. \n356 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran (n 338) [48]-[55]. \n357 ibid [56]-[59]. \n358 ibid [63]-[65]. \n359 ibid [66]. \n\n\n\n120  \n\nstate for torture committed abroad. Canada has clearly legislated so as not to create this \n\nexception to state immunity whether it has an international law obligation to do so or not.\u2019360  \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding this conclusion, Justice Goudge undertook an examination of \n\nCanada\u2019s international law obligations. Firstly, he analyzed whether Canada, which is a \n\nparty to the CAT, was under the obligation to provide a civil remedy for acts of torture \n\ncommitted outside the forum state. Article 14 of the CAT establishes that  \n\n \n\u20181. Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains \n\nredress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation including the means for \n\nas full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of \n\ntorture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation.  \n\n\u20182. Nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim or other person to compensation \n\nwhich may exist under national law.\u2019361  \n\n \n\nIn Justice Goudge\u2019s view, a textual analysis of the CAT shows that \u2018the absence of \n\nexplicit territorial language does not necessarily mean the absence of territorial \n\nlimitation\u2019.362 He also mentioned the evidence of state practice regarding Article 14 limited \n\nthe obligation enshrined in the provision for acts of torture committed in the state of the \n\nforum.363  \n\nMr Bouzari had also argued that the obligation to provide a civil remedy for him \n\nwas established in Article 14 of the ICCPR, which reads as following: \n\n \n\u2018Article 14  \n\n\u20181. All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any \n\ncriminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be \n\nentitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal \n\nestablished by law.\u2019364  \n\n \n\n                                                \n360 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran (n 338) [67]. \n361 Convention Against Torture (n 277). \n362 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran (n 338) [76]. \n363 ibid [78]. \n364 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 \nMarch 1976) 999 UNTS 171. \n\n\n\n121  \n\n  Justice Goudge found there was no evidence that Article 14 of the ICCPR was \n\ninterpreted to require a state to provide a remedy for sovereign acts committed outside its \n\njurisdiction.365 \n\nAs regards customary international law, Justice Goudge considered the jus cogens \n\ncharacter of the prohibition of torture was not questioned.366 Based on a comparative \n\nreview of domestic and international practice, it was concluded that, under customary \n\ninternational law, there was no exception to state immunity in respect of acts in breach of \n\njus cogens committed outside the forum state.367 Nevertheless, even if this was the case, \n\nJustice Goudge asserted that the SIA is a comprehensive and does not provide for such an \n\nexception to state immunity: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the SIA simply does not include a civil action for damages for torture in any of the \n\nspecifically drawn exceptions to the encompassing state immunity provided in s. 3(1). \n\nMoreover, the extent of the prohibition against torture as a rule of jus cogens is determined not \n\nby any particular view of what is required if it is to be meaningful, but rather by the \n\nwidespread and consistent practice of states.\u2019368 \n\n \n\nThe reference to Ex parte Pinochet (No 3) was deemed not to be relevant for the \n\ncase. As put by Justice Goudge: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the opinions in Pinochet clearly reflect the distinction for state immunity purposes between \n\nproceedings seeking a criminal sanction against an individual for acts of torture committed \n\nabroad and proceedings seeking a civil remedy against a foreign state for the same acts. In the \n\nformer case, the sanction can be imposed on the individual without subjecting one state to the \n\njurisdiction of another. That is not so in the latter case.\u2019369 \n\n \n\nFinally, Justice Goudge dismissed the argument that, since the prohibition of \n\ntorture implies the right to be free from it, there must be a remedy for it.370 He offered a \n\ntwo-fold response. Firstly, he considered that a civil remedy was not the only way to give \n\neffect for the prohibition of torture and that the CAT provided for the prosecution of \n\n                                                \n365 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran (n 338) [82]-[83]. \n366 ibid [87]. \n367 ibid [88]. \n368 ibid [90]. \n369 ibid [91]. \n370 ibid [92]. \n\n\n\n122  \n\nindividuals who committed acts of torture committed abroad.371 Secondly, Justice Goudge \n\nasserted that state practice did not indicate that states were under the obligation to provide \n\nfor a civil remedy for acts of torture committed outside the forum state and that the jus \n\ncogens character of the prohibition against torture did not have as a consequence an \n\nobligation for states to provide a civil remedy for its violation.372 \n\nHe concluded that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [b]oth under customary international law and international treaty there is today a balance \n\nstruck between the condemnation of torture as an international crime against humanity and the \n\nprinciple that states must treat each other as equals not to be subjected to each other\u2019s \n\njurisdiction. It would be inconsistent with this balance to provide a civil remedy against a \n\nforeign state for torture committed abroad. In the future, perhaps as the international human \n\nrights movement gathers greater force, this balance may change, either through the domestic \n\nlegislation of states or by international treaty. However, this is not a change to be effected by a \n\ndomestic court adding an exception to the SIA that is not there, or seeing a widespread state \n\npractice that does not exist today.\u2019373  \n\n \n\nMr Bouzari\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the Court. \n\n \n\n3.2 Decisions rendered by international courts prior to Jurisdictional Immunities of \n\nthe State  \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Judgment of the ECtHR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (2001) \n\n \n\nHaving his appeal dismissed by the House of Lords, Mr Al-Adsani brought suit \n\nagainst the United Kingdom before the ECtHR. Mr Al-Adsani alleged the violation of \n\nArticle 3 (prohibition of torture)374 read in conjunction with Articles 13 (right to an \n\n                                                \n371 Bouzari et al v Islamic Republic of Iran (n 338) [93]. \n372 ibid [94]. \n373 ibid [95]. \n374 European Convention on Human Rights (adopted 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September \n1953) 213 UNTS 221: \n \n\n\u2018Article 3\u2013\u2013Prohibition of torture\u2013\u2013No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or \ndegrading treatment or punishment.\u2019  \n\n \n\n\n\n123  \n\neffective remedy)375 and 1 (obligation to respect Human Rights)376, and of Article 6.1 \n\n(right to a fair trial)377 of the ECHR.  \n\nThe ECtHR found there had been no violation of Article 3, since the events alleged \n\nby Mr Al-Adsani did not take place in the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom \n\nauthorities did not have a causal connection with them. Accordingly, the ECtHR held that \n\n\u2018\u2026 it [could not] be said that the High Contracting Party was under a duty to provide a \n\ncivil remedy to the applicant in respect of torture allegedly carried out by the Kuwaiti \n\nauthorities.\u2019378 \n\nWith respect to Article 6.1, the ECtHR dismissed the United Kingdom\u2019s first \n\nsubmission, namely that Mr Aldsani\u2019s claim had no basis in domestic law because \n\nwhatever substantive right he might have been entitled to had been extinguished by the \n\noperation of state immunity.379 According to the ECtHR, \u2018[t]he grant of immunity is to be \n\nseen not as qualifying a substantive right but as a procedural bar on the national courts\u2019 \n\npower to determine the right.\u2019380 Having established Article 6.1 was applicable, the ECtHR \n\nturned to the question of compliance. The ECtHR began by sketching its doctrine with \n\nrespect to the right of access to court, ie, that it is not an absolute right, and that it can be \n\nlimited \u2018by implication\u2019 provided that there is a relationship of proportionality between the \n\n                                                \n375 European Convention on Human Rights (n 374): \n \n\n\u2018Article 13\u2013\u2013Right to an effective remedy\u2013\u2013Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth \nin this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority \nnotwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official \ncapacity.\u2019  \n\n \n376 ibid: \n \n\n\u2018Article 1\u2013\u2013Obligation to respect Human Rights\u2013\u2013The High Contracting Parties shall secure to \neveryone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this \nConvention. \u2018 \n\n \n377 ibid: \n \n\n\u2018Article 6\u2013\u2013Right to a fair trial\u2013\u20131.

The ECtHR \n\nnoted that, in a Report produced in 1999, the ILC pointed out two developments that could \n\nsupport the argument a state could not invoke immunity in respect of gross violations of \n\nhuman rights.385 The first development was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \n\nAct of 1996, which amended the FSIA to add a new exception to the grant of immunity in \n\ncases in which \u2018\u2026 money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or \n\ndeath that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage \n\ntaking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act\u2026\u2019, provided that \n\nthe foreign state in question is designated as a \u2018sponsor of terrorism\u2019 by the United States \n\nand that the claimant or victim was a national of the United States when the acts \n\n                                                \n381 Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (n 378) [53]. \n382 ibid [54]. \n383 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (adopted 23 May 1969, entered into force 27 January 1980) \n1155 UNTS 331. \n384 Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (n 378) [56]. \n385 ILC Working Group, \u2018Report of the Working Group on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their \nProperty\u2019 A/CN.4/L.576 (1999) II(2) YILC.  \n\n\n\n125  \n\noccurred.386 The second was the Ex parte Pinochet (No 3) case, in which the House of \n\nLords held that immunity ratione materiae did not extend to former Heads of State who \n\ncommitted acts of torture. 387  The ECtHR remained unconvinced that, from these \n\ndevelopments, it could be concluded there was acceptance in international law that states \n\ncould not invoke immunity in civil claims for damages arising from jus cogens \n\nviolations.388 As the ECtHR remarked, \u2018the very fact that the amendment [to the FSIA] was \n\nneeded would seem to confirm that the general rule of international law remained that \n\nimmunity attached even in respect of claims of acts of official torture.\u2019389 Also, the Ex \n\nparte Pinochet (No 3) case dealt with the immunity ratione materiae of a former Head of \n\nState from criminal jurisdiction, whilst the case under discussion dealt with the immunity \n\nratione personae of a state from civil jurisdiction.390 The ECtHR concluded the grant of \n\nimmunity to Kuwait by the English courts did not violate Article 6.1 of the ECHR. \n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4, joined by Judge Bratza, added two \n\narguments to support the ECtHR\u2019s judgment. The first one is a variation of the \u2018flood-gate\u2019 \n\nargument, ie accepting jus cogens norms override sovereign immunity would have as a \n\nconsequence a steep increase in undesired litigation:  \n\n \n\u2018The somewhat paradoxical result, had the minority\u2019s view prevailed, could have been that \n\nprecisely those States which so far have been most liberal in accepting refugees and asylum-\n\nseekers, would have had imposed upon them the additional burden of guaranteeing access to a \n\ncourt for the determination of perhaps hundreds of refugees\u2019 civil claims for compensation for \n\nalleged torture. Even if the finding of a violation of Article 6 in this case had not had a \n\n\u201cchilling effect\u201d on the readiness of the Contracting States to accept refugees\u2014a consequence \n\n                                                \n386 US Code, Section 1605A&lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605A> accessed 26 November \n2015. \n387 Regina v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate and Others, Ex Parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 3) \n[2000] 1 AC 147 (House of Lords). \n388 Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (n 378) [66]: \n \n\n\u2018The Court, while noting the growing recognition of the overriding importance of the \nprohibition of torture, does not accordingly find it established that there is yet acceptance in \ninternational law of the proposition that States are not entitled to immunity in respect of civil \nclaims for damages for alleged torture committed outside the forum State. The 1978 [State \nImmunity] Act, which grants immunity to States in respect of personal injury claims unless the \ndamage was caused within the United Kingdom, is not inconsistent with those limitations \ngenerally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity.\u2019 \n\n \n389 ibid [64]. \n390 ibid [65]. \n\n\n\n126  \n\nwhich I would not totally exclude\u2014the question of the effectiveness of the access in the \n\ncircumstances \u2026 would inevitably have arisen.\u2019 391 \n\n \n\nThe second argument concerned the extension of the jus cogens exception to the \n\ndomain of immunity from execution. If jus cogens norms prevailed over the rule which \n\nrequires one state to accord jurisdictional immunity to another, there would be no reason \n\nfor them not to prevail over the rule which requires one state to accord immunity from \n\nexecution to another, and negative consequences would ensue:  \n\n \n\u2018If immunity from jurisdiction were to be regarded as incompatible with Article 6 because of \n\nthe jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture, which prevails over all other international \n\nobligations not having that same hierarchical status, it presumably would also have to prevail \n\nover rules concerning immunity from execution. Consequently, the Contracting States would \n\nhave had to allow attachment and execution against public property of respondent States if the \n\neffectiveness of access to a court could not otherwise be guaranteed.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 [I]n order not to contradict itself the Court would have been forced to hold that the \n\nprohibition of torture must also prevail over immunity of a foreign State\u2019s public property, \n\nsuch as bank accounts intended for public purposes, real estate used for a foreign State\u2019s \n\ncultural institutes and other establishments abroad (including even, it would appear, embassy \n\nbuildings), etc., since it has not been suggested that immunity of such public property from \n\nexecution belongs to the corps of jus cogens. Although giving absolute priority to the \n\nprohibition of torture may at first sight seem very \u201cprogressive\u201d, a more careful consideration \n\ntends to confirm that such a step would also run the risk of proving a sort of \u201cPyrrhic victory\u201d. \n\nInternational cooperation, including cooperation with a view to eradicating the vice of torture, \n\npresupposes the continuing existence of certain elements of a basic framework for the conduct \n\nof international relations. Principles concerning State immunity belong to that regulatory \n\nframework, and I believe it is more conducive to orderly international cooperation to leave this \n\nframework intact than to follow another course.\u2019392 \n\n \n\n3.2.1.1 The dissenting opinions appended to the judgment of the ECtHR in Al-Adsani \n\nv United Kingdom (2001)  \n\n \n\nEight out of the seventeen judges of the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR dissented of \n\nthe judgment of the majority. In a much quoted dissenting opinion, Judges Rozakis and \n\n                                                \n391 Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (Concurring Opinion of Judge Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4 Joined by Judge Bratza) (2001) \n<http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-59885> accessed 26 November 2015. \n392 ibid. \n\n\n\n127  \n\nCaflisch, joined by Judges Wildhaber, Costa, Cabral Barreto and Vaji?, asserted that \u2018the \n\nbasic characteristic of a jus cogens rule is that, as a source of law in the now vertical \n\ninternational legal system, it overrides any other rule which does not have the same \n\nstatus.\u2019 393  Considering that it was demonstrated that the prohibition of torture had \n\n\u2018crystallised as a jus cogens rule\u2019 and that the rules on state immunity \u2018have never been \n\nconsidered by the international community as rules with a hierarchically higher status\u2019394, \n\nthe dissenting judges concluded that the veil of state immunity should be pierced if it \n\nconflicted with jus cogens. As explained by the judges: \n\n \n\u2018[t]he acceptance \u2026 of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture entails that a State \n\nallegedly violating it cannot invoke hierarchically lower rules (in this case, those on State \n\nimmunity) to avoid the consequences of the illegality of its actions. In the circumstances of this \n\ncase, Kuwait cannot validly hide behind the rules on State immunity to avoid proceedings for a \n\nserious claim of torture made before a foreign jurisdiction; and the courts of that jurisdiction \n\n(the United Kingdom) cannot accept a plea of immunity, or invoke it ex officio, to refuse an \n\napplicant adjudication of a torture case. Due to the interplay of the jus cogens rule on \n\nprohibition of torture and the rules on State immunity, the procedural bar of State immunity is \n\nautomatically lifted, because those rules, as they conflict with a hierarchically higher rule, do \n\nnot produce any legal effect. In the same vein, national law which is designed to give domestic \n\neffect to the international rules on State immunity cannot be invoked as creating a \n\njurisdictional bar, but must be interpreted in accordance with and in the light of the imperative \n\nprecepts of jus cogens. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [T]he distinction made by the majority between civil and criminal proceedings, concerning \n\nthe effect of the rule of the prohibition of torture, is not consonant with the very essence of the \n\noperation of the jus cogens rules. It is not the nature of the proceedings which determines the \n\neffects that a jus cogens rule has upon another rule of international law, but the character of the \n\nrule as a peremptory norm and its interaction with a hierarchically lower rule. The prohibition \n\nof torture, being a rule of jus cogens, acts in the international sphere and deprives the rule of \n\nsovereign immunity of all its legal effects in that sphere.\u2019395  \n\n \n\nAt the beginning of his dissenting opinion, Judge Ferrari Bravo exclaimed: \u2018What a \n\npity!\u2019 Judge Ferrari Bravo lamented the \u2018golden opportunity\u2019 missed and the endorsement \n\nby the ECtHR of \u2018old formalist arguments\u2019 in the conclusion that it was not yet accepted in \n\n                                                \n393 Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (Joint Dissenting Opinion of Judges Rozakis and Caflisch, Joined by Judges \nWildhaber, Costa, Cabral Barreto and Vaji?)

According to him, in \n\norder to apply immunity, it is always necessary to balance the competing interests, ie those \n\nrelated to the grant of immunity and those related to the nature of the substantive claim.397  \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Judgment of the ECtHR in Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany \n\n(2002)  \n\n \n\nThe Kalogeropoulou case has a direct link with the Multi-Member Court of \n\nLevadia\u2019s Judgment No 137/1997, which was confirmed and made final by the Greek \n\nCourt of Cassation in Judgment No 11/2000. In Jugment No 137/1997, the Multi-Member \n\nCourt of Levadia ordered Germany to pay compensation for the relatives of the victims of \n\nthe massacre perpetrated by Germany in Distomo during the Second World War. The \n\nenforcement proceedings related to Judgment No 137/1997 were, however, unsuccessful. \n\nArticle 923 of the Greek Code of Civil Procedure establishes as a precondition to the \n\nenforcement of decisions against foreign states the authorization of the Minister of Justice, \n\nwhich was not obtained by the applicants.398 Although the Athens Court of First Instance \n\nheld that Article 923 was incompatible with Article 6.1 of the ECHR and Article 2.3 of the \n\nICCPR, the Athens Court of Appeal upheld Germany\u2019s objection and set aside the \n\njudgment of the Court of First Instance, asserting that Article 923 pursued the public \n\ninterest aim of avoiding disturbances in international relations and was proportionate to \n\nthat aim.399 The Greek Court of Cassation ultimately upheld the position of the Athens \n\nCourt of Appeal, considering that the limitation imposed by Article 923 of the Greek Code \n\nof Civil Procedure was compatible with Article 6.1 of the ECHR.400 \n\nThe applicants resorted to the ECtHR, claiming Greece and Germany, by refusing \n\nto comply with Judgment No 137/1997 of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia, had \n                                                \n396  Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Ferrari Bravo) (2001) \n<http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-59885> accessed 26 November 2015. \n397  Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Loucaides) (2001) \n<http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-59885> accessed 26 November 2015. \n398 Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany [First Section] (Application No 59021/00) (2002) \n<http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-23539> accessed 26 November 2015. I did not have access to the text \nof the Greek Code of Civil Procedure. Thus I had to rely on the ECtHR\u2019s account of the relevant provision.  \n399 ibid. \n400 ibid. \n\n\n\n129  \n\ninfringed Article 6.1 of the ECHR (effective judicial protection) and Article 1 of Protocol \n\nNo 1 to the ECHR (peaceful enjoyment of possessions).401 \n\nThe ECtHR strictly followed the approach it had set out in respect of Article 6.1 in \n\nits prior case-law and, when dealing with the relationship between Article 6.1 and state \n\nimmunity, adhered to its decision in Al-Adsani. The ECtHR began by considering the right \n\nof access to court is not absolute and may be subject to limitations. It then asserted that \n\nContracting States have a margin of appreciation, but the ECtHR has the final word \n\nconcerning the compatibility of the limitations adopted by Contracting States with the \n\nECHR. And then the ECtHR laid out the criteria the limitations applied have to fulfill: (i) \n\nthey cannot impair the very essence of the right; (ii) they have to pursue a legitimate aim; \n\nand (iii) there must a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means \n\nemployed and the aim sought to be realized. In line with the Al-Adsani judgment, the \n\nECtHR considered that \u2018the grant of sovereign immunity to a State in civil proceedings \n\npursues the legitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and \n\ngood relations between States.\u2019402  \n\nIt also stated that, under Article 31.3.c of the VCLT, the ECHR must be interpreted \n\nin harmony with other rules of international law. Accordingly, the ECtHR found that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of \n\npublic international law on State immunity cannot generally be regarded as imposing a \n\ndisproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 1.\u2019403  \n \n\nLike in Al-Adsani, the ECtHR remarked that it was not established that there was \n\nacceptance for the proposition that states are not entitled to immunity in civil proceedings \n\nfor damages arising from crimes against humanity committed outside the forum state.404 At \n\nthe same time, and repeating what it had stated in Al-Adsani, the ECtHR left open the \n\npossibility that there could be such a development in customary international law in the \n\nfuture.405 In the light of these considerations, the conclusion of the ECtHR with respect to \n\nthe claim Greece had violated Article 6.1 of the ECHR was predictable: \n\n \n\n                                                \n401 Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany (n 398). \n402 ibid. \n403 ibid. \n404 ibid. \n405 ibid.  \n\n\n\n130  \n\n\u2018\u2026 the Minister of Justice\u2019s refusal to give the applicants leave to apply for expropriation of \n\ncertain German property situated in Greece cannot be regarded as an unjustified interference \n\nwith their right of access to a tribunal, particularly as it was examined by the domestic courts \n\nand confirmed by a judgment of the Greek Court of Cassation.\u2019406 \n\n \n\nThe ECtHR then moved to the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No 1 of the \n\nECHR. The ECtHR remarked it was not disputed the \u2018enforceable claim\u2019 obtained by the \n\napplicants was a \u2018possession\u2019 within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No 1 and that \n\nthere had been an interference with their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their \n\npossessions.407 It then examined whether the requirements for a justified interference under \n\nthe ECHR had been satisfied. The ECtHR considered that \u2018the first and most important \n\nrequirement\u2019 provided for by Article 1 of Protocol No 1 is that a deprivation of possessions \n\nmust be lawful: it is only authorized \u2018\u2026 subject to the conditions provided for by \n\nlaw\u2026\u2019.408 The ECtHR did not dwell too much on this requirement, considering it had been \n\nmet since the interference in question was based on Article 923 of the Greek Code of Civil \n\nProcedure. Article 1 of Protocol No 1 also establishes that a deprivation of possessions \n\nmust be \u2018in the public interest.\u2019 It concluded that there could be no doubt that this \n\nrequirement had been fulfilled, \u2018since it was intended to avoid disturbances in relations \n\nbetween Greece and Germany.\u2019409 Lastly, the ECtHR considered that the structure of \n\nProtocol No 1 required \u2018a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the \n\ncommunity and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental \n\nrights.\u2019410 The ECtHR stressed once again that  \n\n \n\n                                                \n406 Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany (n 398). \n407 ibid. \n408 Protocol No 1 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (adopted \n20 March 1952, entered into force 18 May 1954) 213 UNTS 262: \n \n\n\u2018Article 1\u2014Protection of property \n\u2018Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one \nshall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions \nprovided for by law and by the general principles of international law.  \n\u2018The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce \nsuch laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general \ninterest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u2019 \n\n \n409 Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany (n 398). \n410 ibid. \n\n\n\n131  \n\n\u2018\u2026 the Greek Government could not be required to override the principle of State immunity \n\nagainst their will and compromise their good international relations in order to allow the \n\napplicants to enforce a judicial decision delivered at the end of civil proceedings.\u2019411  \n\n \n\nAs supporting arguments to contend that a balance between the general interest and \n\nthe protection of the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of property had been \n\nstruck, the ECtHR emphasized that the situation could not have given rise to a legitimate \n\nexpectation, since the applicants were aware that the authorization of the Minister of \n\nJustice had not been obtained, and that the applicants might be able to enforce the relevant \n\njudgment in the future or in another country.412 \n\nThe ECtHR also declared Germany\u2019s responsibility under the ECHR had not been \n\nengaged. Article 1 of the ECHR prescribes that \u2018[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure \n\nto everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this \n\nConvention.\u2019413 The ECtHR understood that the participation of Germany in proceedings \n\nagainst it in the courts of another state was not sufficient to bring the applicants \u2018within \n\n[its] jurisdiction\u2019 for the purposes of Article 1 of the ECHR\u2013\u2013Germany\u2019s position in the \n\nproceedings was akin to that of a private individual.414 \n\n \n\n3.3 The ICJ\u2019s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (2012) \n\n \n\n3.3.1 Submissions of the parties \n\n \n\nGermany started proceedings against Italy before the ICJ on 23 December 2008, \n\ninvoking as basis for the jurisdiction of the Court Article 1 of the European Convention for \n\nthe Peaceful Settlement of Disputes of 29 April 1957, which entered into force between \n\nGermany and Italy on 18 April 1961.415  \n\n                                                \n411 Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany (n 398). \n412 ibid. \n413 European Convention on Human Rights (n 374). \n414 Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany (n 398). \n415 European Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes (adopted 29 April 1957, entered into force \n18 April 1961) 320 UNTS 423: \n \n\n\u2018Article 1\u2013\u2013The High Contracting Parties shall submit to the judgement of the International \nCourt of Justice all international legal disputes which may arise between them including, in \nparticular, those concerning: a) the interpretation of a treaty;

 \n\n\u2018(2) by taking measures of constraint against \u2018Villa Vigoni\u2019, German State property used for \n\ngovernment non-commercial purposes, also committed violations of Germany\u2019s jurisdictional \n\nimmunity; \n\n\u2018(3) by declaring Greek judgments based on occurrences similar to those defined above in \n\nrequest No. 1 enforceable in Italy, committed a further breach of Germany\u2019s jurisdictional \n\nimmunity. \n\n\u2018Accordingly, the Federal Republic of Germany prays the Court to adjudge and declare that \n\n\u2018(4) the Italian Republic\u2019s international responsibility is engaged; \n\n\u2018(5) the Italian Republic must, by means of its own choosing, take any and all steps to ensure \n\nthat all the decisions of its courts and other judicial authorities infringing Germany\u2019s sovereign \n\nimmunity become unenforceable; \n\n\u2018(6) the Italian Republic must take any and all steps to ensure that in the future Italian courts do \n\nnot entertain legal actions against Germany founded on the occurrences described in request \n\nNo. 1 above.\u2019416 \n\n \n\nItaly, on its part, requested the ICJ to \u2018\u2026 adjudge and hold the claims of the \n\nApplicant to be unfounded\u2019 but it added that it had \u2018\u2026 no objection to any decision by the \n\nCourt obliging Italy to ensure that the mortgage on Villa Vigoni inscribed at the land \n\nregistry is cancelled.\u2019417 \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Merits of the case \n\n \n\nHaving established the scope of its jurisdiction, the ICJ first addressed Germany\u2019s \n\nsubmission that Italy had acted in breach of Germany\u2019s jurisdictional immunity by \n\n                                                                                                                                              \n \n416 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Merits: Judgment) [2012] \nICJ Rep 99, [15]-[17].  \n417 ibid. \n\n\n\n133  \n\nexercising jurisdiction over civil claims based on the violations of the international law of \n\narmed conflict committed by Germany in Italian territory between 1943 and 1945. \n\nThe ICJ recalled that there could be no doubt the acts perpetrated by Germany \n\nwhich provided the basis for the civil claims brought to the Italian courts were in violation \n\nof the international law of armed conflict applicable at the time, but it emphasized the \n\nquestion it had to settle was whether Italy had the obligation to accord immunity to \n\nGermany in those proceedings.418  \n\nThe Court then turned to the question of sources of law and the applicable law to \n\nsettle the dispute. Its first finding was that the parties were in agreement that \u2018\u2026 immunity \n\nis governed by international law and is not a mere matter of comity.\u2019419 When considering \n\nthe treaty law on the subject, the ICJ found out that the ECSI was not applicable because, \n\nalthough Germany was one of the Parties to the treaty, Italy was not. Neither state had \n\nratified the UNCJISP, which nonetheless was not yet in force internationally.420 The \n\nconclusion was that the Court had to determine the scope and extent of the customary \n\ninternational law of state immunity.421  \n\nIn a rather formal fashion, the Court, invoking the North Sea Continental Shelf \n\ncases422, stated that it had to identify with respect to state immunity the existence of a \n\n\u2018settled practice\u2019 coupled with opinio juris. Whilst it is not always clear how to isolate one \n\nelement from the other, since, in order to demonstrate the existence of opinio juris, \n\n                                                \n418 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [52]-[53]. The ICJ identified three categories of cases: the \nfirst related to the \u2018large-scale killing of civilians in occupied territory as part of a policy of reprisals\u2019; the \nsecond category involved the deportation of civilians from Italy to perform slave labor in Germany; the third, \nthe denial of the status of prisoners of war (and the protections entailed by this status) to members of the \nItalian armed forces, who were also submitted to forced labor.  \n419 ibid [53]. \n420 ibid [54]. \n421 ibid [55]. \n422  North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark, Federal Republic of \nGermany/Netherland) (Merits: Judgment) [1969] ICJ Rep 3, [77]:  \n \n\n\u2018The essential point in this connection \u2026 is that even if these instances of action by non-parties \nto the Convention were much more numerous than they in fact are, they would not, even in the \naggregate, suffice in themselves to constitute the opinio juris;\u2014for, in order to achieve this \nresult, two conditions must be fulfilled. Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled \npractice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a \nbelief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it. The \nneed for such a belief, i.e., the existence of a subjective element, is implicit in the very notion \nof the opinio juris sive necessitatis. The States concerned must therefore feel that they are \nconforming to what amounts to a legal obligation. The frequency, or even habitua1 character of \nthe acts is not in itself enough. There are many international acts, e.g., in the field of \nceremonial and protocol, which are performed almost invariably, but which are motivated only \nby considerations of courtesy, convenience or tradition, and not by any sense of legal duty.\u2019 \n \n\n\n\n134  \n\nreference is made to practice, and opinio juris is employed to identify the relevant \n\npractice423, the ICJ established a divide between the two: \n\n \n\u2018In the present context, State practice of particular significance is to be found in the judgments \n\nof national courts faced with the question whether a foreign State is immune, the legislation of \n\nthose States which have enacted statutes dealing with immunity, the claims to immunity \n\nadvanced by States before foreign courts and the statements made by States, first in the course \n\nof the extensive study of the subject by the International Law Commission and then in the \n\ncontext of the adoption of the United Nations Convention. Opinio juris in this context is \n\nreflected in particular in the assertion by States claiming immunity that international law \n\naccords them a right to such immunity from the jurisdiction of other States; in the \n\nacknowledgment, by States granting immunity, that international law imposes upon them an \n\nobligation to do so; and, conversely, in the assertion by States in other cases of a right to \n\nexercise jurisdiction over foreign States. While it may be true that States sometimes decide to \n\naccord an immunity more extensive than that required by international law, for present \n\npurposes, the point is that the grant of immunity in such a case is not accompanied by the \n\nrequisite opinio juris and therefore sheds no light upon the issue currently under consideration \n\nby the Court.\u2019424  \n\n \n\nAfter having established the dispute would have to be settled on the basis of \n\ncustomary international law, the ICJ expressed its view on the importance and on the \n\nfoundations of the law of state immunity. The ICJ considered that \u2018\u2026 the rule of State \n\nimmunity occupies an important place in international law and international relations\u2019425 \n\nand conveyed the traditional view that state immunity  \u2018\u2026 derives from the principle of \n\nsovereign equality of state, which, as Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United \n\nNations makes clear, is one of the fundamental principles of the international legal \n\norder.\u2019426 The Court then briefly considered that, whilst exceptions to state immunity \n\n\u2018represent a departure from the principle of sovereign equality\u2019, immunity itself \u2018may \n\nrepresent a departure from the principle of territorial sovereignty and the jurisdiction which \n\nflows from it.\u2019427 \n\n                                                \n423 See Peter Haggenmacher, \u2018La doctrine des deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments du droit coutumier dans la pratique de la cour \ninternationale\u2019 (1986) 90 RGDIP 5; Martti Koskenniemi, \u2018The Politics of International Law\u2019 (1990) 1(1) \nEJIL 4, 20-27; Martti Koskenniemi, From Apology to Utopia: The Structure of International Legal Argument \n(CUP 2005) 388-473. \n424 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [55]. \n425 ibid [57]. \n426 ibid. \n427 ibid. \n\n\n\n135  \n\nThe Court then addressed a question of intertemporal law on which the Parties \n\ndisagreed, namely whether the law to be applied was that in force in 1943-1945, at the time \n\nthe events which gave rise to the proceedings in Italian courts happened, or that which \n\napplied at the time the proceedings before Italian courts occurred.428 The ICJ found its \n\nresponse in Article 13 of the DARSIWA 2001, according to which \u2018[a]n act of a State does \n\nnot constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the \n\nobligation in question at the time the act occurs.\u2019429 Considering the issue in question was \n\nthe denial of immunity by Italian courts, the Court found that it had to apply the \n\ninternational law in force at the times the proceedings in question happened.430 \n\nLastly, before addressing Italy\u2019s arguments substantiating the contention that it had \n\nnot failed to respect Germany\u2019s jurisdictional immunity, the ICJ made some remarks \n\nregarding the nature of the acts committed by Germany which were the subject of \n\nproceedings before Italian courts. According to the Court, those were acta jure imperii. \n\nThe ICJ dismissed the understanding according to which acts amounting to international \n\ncrimes and grave breaches of international humanitarian law could not have the nature of \n\nsovereign acts. As it explained:  \n\n \n\u2018The Court considers that the terms \u201cjure imperii\u201d and \u201cjure gestionis\u201d do not imply that the \n\nacts in question are lawful but refer rather to whether the acts in question fall to be assessed by \n\nreference to the law governing the exercise of sovereign power (jus imperii) or the law \n\nconcerning non-sovereign activities of a State, especially private and commercial activities (jus \n\ngestionis). To the extent that this distinction is significant for determining whether or not a \n\nState is entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of another State\u2019s courts in respect of a \n\nparticular act, it has to be applied before that jurisdiction can be exercised, whereas the legality \n\nor illegality of the act is something which can be determined only in the exercise of that \n\njurisdiction. Although the present case is unusual in that the illegality of the acts at issue has \n\nbeen admitted by Germany at all stages of the proceedings, the Court considers that this fact \n\ndoes not alter the characterization of those acts as acta jure imperii.\u2019431 \n\n \n\nHaving stated its position on these questions, the ICJ turned to Italy\u2019s first \n\nargument, based on the territorial tort principle. The Italian contention was that, under \n\n                                                \n428 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [58]. \n429 ILC, \u2018Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries\u2019 \n(2001)&lt;legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf> accessed 20 November \n2015. \n430 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [58]. \n431 ibid [60]. \n\n\n\n136  \n\ncustomary international law, a foreign State does not have the right to immunity for torts \n\ncommitted in the forum state, even for acta jure imperii. The arguments brought by Italy \n\nregarding this point were not different from the ones used by Italian courts. Italy pointed \n\nout that Article 11 of the ECSI and Article 12 of the UNCJISP enshrined the tort \n\nexception, and so did numerous domestic codifications of the law of state immunity.432 \n\nItaly also added that Article 31 of the ECSI, which reinstates the rule of state immunity for \n\nacts performed by armed forces on the territory of another Contracting State, had to be \n\ninterpreted as referring to the tolerated presence of armed forces under regular \n\ncircumstances, particularly in the context of Status of Force Agreements.433  \n\nThe ICJ remarked that it did not have to rule whether, under customary \n\ninternational law, the tort exception was applicable to acta jure imperii. It decided to take a \n\nmore restrictive approach and understood that it only had to verify whether the tort \n\nexception applied to \u2018\u2026 acts committed on the territory of the forum State by the armed \n\nforces of a foreign State, and other organs of State working in co-operation with those \n\narmed forces, in the course of conducting an armed conflict.\u2019434 In consonance with what it \n\nhad indicated, the ICJ followed a very formalistic path to find the answer to this question.  \n\nFirstly, it analyzed the treaty law on the matter, but only insofar as it shed light on \n\ncustomary international law. Unlike Italy had argued, the ICJ found that Article 31 of the \n\nECSI did not refer solely to the regular, consented presence force of armed forces in the \n\nterritory of the forum state, but applied \u2018\u2026 irrespective of whether those forces are present \n\nin the territory of the forum with the consent of the forum State and whether their acts take \n\nplace in peacetime or in conditions of armed conflict.\u2019435 Although the UNCJISP does not \n\nhave a clause excluding the acts of armed forces from it scope, the ICJ referred to the \n\nILC\u2019s Commentaries to the Draft Articles that resulted in the adoption of the UNCJISP, \n\naccording to which Article 12 is not meant to apply to \u2018situations involving armed \n\nconflicts\u2019, noting that this interpretation remained unchallenged by other states and that \n\ntwo states which ratified the Convention (Sweden and Norway) declared the same \n\nunderstanding.436  \n\n                                                \n432 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [62]. \n433 ibid. \n434 ibid [65]. \n435 ibid [67]. \n436  ibid [69]; ILC, \u2018Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, with \ncommentaries\u2019 in \u2018Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-third session\u2019 (29 \nApril-19 July 1991) UN Doc A/46/10 (1991) II(2) YILC 13-62, 44-46. \n\n\n\n137  \n\nSubsequently, the ICJ analyzed the domestic codifications of the law of state \n\nimmunity, and found that out of ten states (United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, \n\nCanada, Australia, Singapore, Argentina, Israel, Japan, Pakistan), nine had codified the tort \n\nexception (Pakistan being the exception). Out of these nine, only the United Kingdom\u2019s \n\nState Immunity Act 1978 and Singapore\u2019s State Immunity Act 1985 excluded proceedings \n\nrelated to the activities of armed forces from their scope. In any case, however, as found by \n\nthe ICJ, the courts of the other states, whose codifications did not provide for such a \n\ngeneral exclusion, had never been called to adjudge a case involving the acts of armed \n\nforces in a situation of conflict.437  \n\nFinally, the ICJ examined the judgments of national courts. It gave special attention \n\nto cases which had later developments in international courts. The ICJ remarked that in \n\nMcElhinney v UK, Grosz v France and Kalogeropoulou and others v Greece and \n\nGermany, the ECtHR took the position that the grant of immunity to a foreign state in \n\nrespect of acta jure imperii committed by its armed forces in the territory of the forum \n\nstate did not violate the ECHR. Surveying the judgments of domestic courts, the ICJ found \n\nthat only judgments of Italian courts and the judgments of the Greek courts in the Distomo \n\ncase supported the tort exception argument put forth by Italy.438 The ICJ also remarked that \n\nthe Greek Special Supreme Court in Margellos v Germany held that Germany was entitled \n\nto immunity, thus having taken a different position than the Greek Supreme Court in the \n\nDistomo case, and that, under Greek law, Greek courts have to follow the position of the \n\nSpecial Supreme Court, unless they find customary international law on the subject has \n\nchanged.439 \n\nThe ICJ took with respect to the tort exception argument what the Italian Court of \n\nCassation labeled as a quantitative approach. The ICJ limited itself to take note of treaty \n\nlaw and domestic statutes. When it assessed the judicial decisions on the subject, it merely \n\ntook note of the outcomes, not dwelling upon the consistency of the arguments employed. \n\nThe ICJ ultimately found that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 customary international law continues to require that a State be accorded immunity in \n\nproceedings for torts allegedly committed on the territory of another State by its armed forces \n\nand other organs of State in the course of conducting an armed conflict.\u2019440 \n\n                                                \n437 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [71]. \n438 ibid [76]. \n439 ibid. \n440 ibid [78]. \n\n\n\n138  \n\n \n\nNext, the ICJ analyzed Italy\u2019s three-stranded argument according to which the \n\ndenial of immunity was justified due to the subject-matter and the circumstances of the \n\nclaim brought before its courts. According to Italy, the gravity of the acts committed by \n\nGermany (amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity), the violation of jus \n\ncogens norms, and the lack of other forms of redress entitled the Italian courts not to grant \n\nimmunity to Germany.  \n\nThe ICJ, although emphasizing Germany committed serious violations of \n\ninternational law, ruled that the gravity of these violations did not operate to deprive \n\nGermany of its entitlement to immunity. The ICJ reasoned that there would be a logical \n\ninconsistency otherwise, since immunity is an issue which precedes the merits and the \n\ndetermination of the gravity of the acts committed presupposes an examination of the \n\nmerits. In the words of the Court,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the proposition that the availability of immunity will be to some extent dependent upon the \n\ngravity of the unlawful act presents a logical problem. Immunity from jurisdiction is an \n\nimmunity not merely from being subjected to an adverse judgment but from being subjected to \n\nthe trial process. It is, therefore, necessarily preliminary in nature. Consequently, a national \n\ncourt is required to determine whether or not a foreign State is entitled to immunity as a matter \n\nof international law before it can hear the merits of the case brought before it and before the \n\nfacts have been established. If immunity were to be dependent upon the State actually having \n\ncommitted a serious violation of international human rights law or the law of armed conflict, \n\nthen it would become necessary for the national court to hold an enquiry into the merits in \n\norder to determine whether it had jurisdiction. If, on the other hand, the mere allegation that the \n\nState had committed such wrongful acts were to be sufficient to deprive the State of its \n\nentitlement to immunity, immunity could, in effect be negated simply by skillful construction \n\nof the claim.\u2019441 \n\n \n\nNevertheless, the ICJ conceded that, although it may be illogical, customary \n\ninternational law might have evolved to require or to allow the denial of immunity in cases \n\nin which a state is responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and \n\ninternational human rights law.442 The ICJ once again adopted a quantitative approach to \n\nthe issue. It concluded that only the judgments of Italian courts and the judgments of the \n\nGreek courts in the Distomo case (which were later repudiated by the Greek Special \n                                                \n441 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [82]. \n442 ibid [83]. \n\n\n\n139  \n\nSupreme Court in Margellos v Germany) could substantiate this claim.443 By reviewing \n\nmany domestic judgments, the ICJ found out there was a widespread tendency to reject the \n\nposition of the Italian courts, which, in its view, demonstrated that \u2018\u2026 customary \n\ninternational law does not treat a State\u2019s entitlement to immunity as dependent upon the \n\ngravity of the act of which it is accused or the peremptory nature of the rule which it is \n\nalleged to have violated.\u2019444 The ICJ also rejected Italy\u2019s argument that the law of state \n\nimmunity was undergoing a process of change, which could result in a new exception to \n\nstate immunity based on the gravity of the violations. The ICJ added that the judgment of \n\nthe House of Lords in Ex Parte Pinochet (No 3) was not relevant, because it dealt with the \n\ndifferent issue of the immunity of a former Head of State from criminal jurisdiction.445 \n\nFurthermore, the ICJ observed that neither domestic legislations nor treaty law (the ECSI \n\nand UNCJISP) limited immunity on the grounds of the gravity of the acts committed or the \n\nperemptory character of the rule violated.446 Finally, the Court referred again to the \n\njudgments of the ECtHR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom and Kalogeropoulou and others v \n\nGreece and Germany, which pointed out that, under international law, it was not \n\nestablished there was an exception to state immunity in respect of civil claims brought \n\nagainst foreign states for grave breaches of international humanitarian law and human \n\nrights law.447 The ICJ therefore concluded that  \n\n \n\n                                                \n443 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [83]. \n444 ibid [84]-[85]:  \n \n\n\u2018That practice is particularly evident in the judgments of national courts. Arguments to the \neffect that international law no longer required State immunity in cases of allegations of \nserious violations of international human rights law, war crimes or crimes against humanity \nhave been rejected by the courts in Canada (Bouzari v. Islamic Republic of Iran, Court of \nAppeal of Ontario, [2004] Dominion Law Reports (DLR), 4th Series, Vol. 243, p. 406; ILR, \nVol. 128, p. 586; allegations of torture), France (judgment of the Court of Appeal of Paris, 9 \nSeptember 2002, and Cour de cassation, No. 02-45961, 16 December 2003, Bulletin civil de la \nCour de cassation (Bull. civ.), 2003, I, No. 258, p. 206 (the Bucheron case); Cour de cassation, \nNo. 03-41851, 2 June 2004, Bull. civ., 2004, I, No. 158, p. 132 (the X case) and Cour de \ncassation, No. 04-47504, 3 January 2006 (the Grosz case); allegations of crimes against \nhumanity), Slovenia (case No. Up-13/99, Constitutional Court of Slovenia; allegations of war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity), New Zealand (Fang v.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court \n\nmust emphasize that it is addressing only the immunity of the State itself from the jurisdiction \n\nof the courts of other States; the question of whether, and if so to what extent, immunity might \n\napply in criminal proceedings against an official of the State is not in issue in the present \n\ncase.\u2019448 \n\n \n\nSubsequently, the Court addressed the second strand of the argument, namely that \n\nthere is a conflict between state immunity and jus cogens, and that this conflict should be \n\nsolved in favor of the higher-ranking jus cogens norms. According to the ICJ, there is no \n\nsuch conflict: jus cogens norms have a substantive character, whilst the rules of state \n\nimmunity are procedural in nature. In the ICJ\u2019s view, there could not be a relationship of \n\nsubordination between jus cogens norms and the rules of state immunity. The ICJ \n\nexpressed itself in the following way:  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 no such conflict [between rules of jus cogens and the rule of customary international law \n\nwhich requires one state to accord immunity to another] exists. Assuming for this purpose that \n\nthe rules of the law of armed conflict which prohibit the murder of civilians in occupied \n\nterritory, the deportation of civilian inhabitants to slave labour and the deportation of prisoners \n\nof war to slave labour are rules of jus cogens, there is no conflict between those rules and the \n\nrules on State immunity. The two sets of rules address different matters. The rules of State \n\nimmunity are procedural in character and are confined to determining whether or not the courts \n\nof one State may exercise jurisdiction in respect of another State. They do not bear upon the \n\nquestion whether or not the conduct in respect of which the proceedings are brought was \n\nlawful or unlawful. That is why the application of the contemporary law of State immunity to \n\nproceedings concerning events which occurred in 1943-1945 does not infringe the principle \n\nthat law should not be applied retrospectively to determine matters of legality and \n\nresponsibility \u2026 For the same reason, recognizing the immunity of a foreign State in \n\naccordance with customary international law does not amount to recognizing as lawful a \n\nsituation created by the breach of a jus cogens rule, or rendering aid and assistance in \n\nmaintaining that situation, and so cannot contravene the principle in Article 41 of the \n\nInternational Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility.\u2019449  \n\n \n\nThe ICJ took a position that many would consider to render jus cogens norms \n\notiose. Relying on its pronouncements in Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo, \n                                                \n448 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [91]. \n449 ibid [93]. \n\n\n\n141  \n\naccording to which the violation of a jus cogens norm does not confer to the Court a \n\njurisdiction it would not otherwise have450, and in Arrest Warrant, in which the Court held \n\nthat an incumbent Foreign Minister enjoyed immunity from criminal jurisdiction even \n\nwhen suspected of having violated rules that possess the character of jus cogens451, the ICJ \n\nasserted there was \u2018no basis\u2019 for the proposition according to which  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 no rule which is not of the status of jus cogens may be applied if to do so would hinder the \n\nenforcement of a jus cogens rule, even in the absence of a direct conflict \u2026 A jus cogens rule \n\nis one from which no derogation is permitted but the rules which determine the scope and \n\nextent of jurisdiction and when that jurisdiction may be exercised do not derogate from those \n\nsubstantive rules which possess jus cogens status, nor is there anything inherent in the concept \n\nof jus cogens which would require their modification or would displace their application.\u2019452 \n\n \n\nLastly, in order to dismiss this argument, the ICJ once again assessed domestic \n\njudicial practice, concluding that national tribunals had overall rejected that jus cogens had \n\nthe effect of overriding state immunity.453  \n\n                                                \n450 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the \nCongo v. Rwanda) (Merits: Judgment) [2006] ICJ Rep 6, [64]: \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 The Court observes, however, as it has already had occasion to emphasize, that \u201cthe erga \nomnes character of a norm and the rule of consent to jurisdiction are two different things\u201d (East \nTimor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29), and that the \nmere fact that rights and obligations erga omnes may be at issue in a dispute would not give \nthe Court jurisdiction to entertain that dispute.  \n\u2018The same applies to the relationship between peremptory norms of general international law \n(jus cogens) and the establishment of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction: the fact that a dispute relates to \ncompliance with a norm having such a character, which is assuredly the case with regard to the \nprohibition of genocide, cannot of itself provide a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court to \nentertain that dispute. Under the Court\u2019s Statute that jurisdiction is always based on the consent \nof the parties.\u2019 \n\n \n451 Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Belgium) (Merits: Judgment) \n[2002] ICJ Rep 3, [58]: \n \n\n\u2018The Court has carefully examined State practice, including national legislation and those few \ndecisions of national higher courts, such as the House of Lords or the French Court of \nCassation. It has been unable to deduce from this practice that there exists under customary \ninternational law any form of exception to the rule according immunity from criminal \njurisdiction and inviolability to incumbent Ministers for Foreign Affairs, where they are \nsuspected of having committed war crimes or crimes against humanity.\u2019 \n\n \n452 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [95] \n453 ibid [96]:  \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 [the] argument about the effect of jus cogens displacing the law of State immunity has been \nrejected by the national courts of the United Kingdom (Jones v. Saudi Arabia, House of Lords, \n[2007] 1 AC 270; ILR, Vol. 129, p. 629), Canada (Bouzari v. Islamic Republic of Iran, Court of \nAppeal of Ontario, DLR, 4th Series, Vol. 243, p. 406; ILR, Vol. 128, p. 586), Poland \n\n\n\n142  \n\nSubsequently, the ICJ considered Italy\u2019s argument that the denial of immunity \n\ncould be justified on the grounds that other attempts to secure compensation for the victims \n\nhad failed. This argument concerned particularly the group of victims referred as Italian \n\nMilitary Internees. Those victims were members of the Italian armed forces who were \n\ndeported to Germany to perform forced labor. Although at the time they were entitled to \n\nthe status of prisoners of war, they were denied it by the German Reich. When Germany \n\nset up a scheme of compensation to the individuals who were subject to forced labor and \n\nother violations, by means of a Federal Law passed on 2 August 2000, it excluded from the \n\nright to compensation those who had the status of prisoner of war, based on the \n\nconsideration that, under international law, prisoners of war could be put to work under \n\ncertain conditions. Therefore, although those victims had the right to the protection owed \n\nto prisoners of war, they were denied this status by the Germany Reich. Still, when \n\nGermany set up a system of compensation, it considered that the Italian Military Internees \n\nhad never lost the status of prisoner of war and did not have the right to compensation \n\nunder the 2000 Federal Law.  \n\nThe ICJ limited itself to say that it was a matter of \u2018regret\u2019 and \u2018surprise\u2019 that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 Germany decided to deny compensation to a group of victims on the ground that they had \n\nbeen entitled to a status which, at the relevant time, Germany had refused to recognize, \n\nparticularly since those victims had thereby been denied the legal protection to which that \n\nstatus entitled them.\u2019454  \n\n \n\nNevertheless, after highlighting once again one of the recurring themes of its \n\njudgment\u2013\u2013namely that state immunity, international responsibility and the duty to make \n\nreparation are different questions\u2013\u2013the ICJ held that it could  \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                              \n(Natoniewski, Supreme Court, Polish Yearbook of International Law, Vol. XXX, 2010, p. \n299), Slovenia (case No. Up-13/99, Constitutional Court of Slovenia), New Zealand (Fang v. \nJiang, High Court, [2007] NZAR p. 420; ILR, Vol. 141, p. 702), and Greece (Margellos, \nSpecial Supreme Court, ILR, Vol. 129, p. 525), as well as by the European Court of Human \nRights in Al-Adsani v. United Kingdom and Kalogeropoulou and others v. Greece and \nGermany \u2026, in each case after careful consideration. The Court does not consider the \njudgment of the French Cour de cassation of 9 March 2011 in La R\u00e9union a\u00e9rienne v. Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya (No. 09-14743, 9 March 2011, Bull. civ., March 2011, No. 49, p. 49) as \nsupporting a different conclusion.\u2019 \n \n\n454 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [99]. \n\n\n\n143  \n\n\u2018\u2026 find no basis in the State practice from which customary international law is derived that \n\ninternational law makes the entitlement of a State to immunity dependent upon the existence of \n\neffective alternative means of securing redress.\u2019455 \n\n \n\nThe ICJ also dismissed Italy\u2019s contention that the three strands of the argument (the \n\ngravity of the violations, the jus cogens status of the norms breached and the lack of other \n\nmeans of redress) had a \u2018combined effect\u2019. Since it was not persuaded by each of the three \n\nstrands, the Court asserted that, even if considered together, they would not have the effect \n\npurported by Italy.456 The Court also took the opportunity to assert immunity was a right of \n\nthe state and therefore it could not be displaced by means of a balancing exercise\u2014an \n\nexercise which, as it may be remembered, was performed by the Italian Court of Cassation: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [A]ccording to international law, State immunity, where it exists, is a right of the foreign \n\nState. In addition \u2026 national courts have to determine questions of immunity at the outset of \n\nthe proceedings, before consideration of the merits. Immunity cannot, therefore, be made \n\ndependent upon the outcome of a balancing exercise of the specific circumstances of each case \n\nto be conducted by the national court before which immunity is claimed.\u2019457 \n\n \n\nThe two other submissions put forth by Germany were dealt with by the ICJ rather \n\nsuccinctly.  \n\nAfter the decision of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia in the Distomo case was \n\ndeclared enforceable in Italy, the Greek claimants registered a legal charge (\u2018ipoteca \n\ngiudiziale\u2019) against the German property of Villa Vigoni, located in Italian territory. \n\nGermany argued that Italy, by taking this measure of constraint, had violated Germany\u2019s \n\nright to immunity from enforcement. The ICJ found that, being \u2018\u2026 clear in the present \n\ncase that the property which was the subject of the measure of constraint at issue is being \n\nused for governmental purposes that are entirely non-commercial, and hence for purposes \n\nfalling within Germany\u2019s sovereign functions\u2019458, Italy had indeed breached the obligation \n\nto respect the immunity from enforcement owed to Germany.  \n\nThe decisions of the Italian courts conferring exequatur to the decisions of the \n\nGreek courts in the Distomo case were also found to be in violation of Germany\u2019s right to \n\nimmunity. Whilst the purpose of exequatur proceedings is not to decide the merits of a \n                                                \n455 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [101]. \n456 ibid [105]-[106]. \n457 ibid [104]. \n458 ibid [120]. \n\n\n\n144  \n\ncase, the ICJ considered that the court seized of such an application \u2018\u2026 has to ask itself \n\nwhether, in the event that it had itself been seized of the merits of a dispute identical to that \n\nwhich was the subject of the foreign judgment, it would have been obliged under \n\ninternational law to accord immunity to the respondent State.\u2019459 Given that Italy would \n\nhave to grant immunity if it had been seized of a case identical to the one the Greek courts \n\nadjudged, the ICJ concluded that Italy had violated Germany\u2019s jurisdictional immunity by \n\ngranting exequatur to the aforementioned decisions of the Greek courts.  \n\n \n\n3.3.3 The dissenting opinion of Judge Can\u00e7ado Trindade \n\n \n\nWhilst Judge Yusuf460 and Judge ad hoc Giorgio Gaja461 dissented from the finding \n\nthat Italy had violated Germany\u2019s jurisdictional immunity by allowing civil claims based \n\non the violations of international humanitarian law committed by Germany between 1943 \n\nand 1945, Judge Can\u00e7ado Trindade was the only judge to dissent of the ICJ\u2019s judgment as \n\na whole, asserting he was in disagreement with \u2018the adopted methodology, the approach \n\n                                                \n459 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [130]. \n460 See Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Yusuf) [2012] ICJ Rep 99. Judge Yusuf\u2019s dissent focused on the processes of change and development \nof international law. He highlighted that, there being a \u2018grey zone\u2019 in the law, a court may clarify and fix its \ncontent, thus acting as an agent of development of international law (\u00a747). Yusuf criticized the ICJ\u2019s \napproach to the ascertainment of customary international law by asking why the Court attached more weight \nto some decisions to the detriment of the decisions rendered by the Italian and Greek Courts and whether \ncustomary international law was a \u2018question of relative numbers\u2019 (\u00a724). After all, as put by him, \u2018[s]tate \nimmunity is \u2026 as full of holes as Swiss cheese\u2019 (\u00a726), and these holes were mostly produced by the action of \ndomestic courts, at first isolated. In his words (\u00a748- \u00a751):  \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 in the area of State immunity it is not to be excluded that such domestic courts may be \nperforming a law-development function, even when their decisions are not yet shared by other \njurisdictions or are considered, at first sight, not to conform to what may have hitherto been \nviewed as State practice. The Court itself appears to recognize the potential of domestic courts \nfor further development of the law of immunity through its references to certain judicial \ndecisions which were the first to formulate some of the derogations and exceptions to State \nimmunity. \n\u2018\u2026 The assertion of jurisdiction by domestic courts for a failure to make reparations for \nserious breaches of the law of armed conflict admitted by the responsible State, particularly \nwhere no other means of redress is available, could not, in my view, harm the independence or \nthe sovereignty of another State. It simply contributes to the crystallization of an emerging \nexception to State immunity, which is based on the principles underlying human rights and \nhumanitarian law and on the widely-held opinio juris of ensuring the realization of those \nrights, including the right to an effective remedy, in those circumstances where the victims \nwould have no other means of redress.\u2019  \n\n \n461 See Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge ad hoc Gaja) [2012] ICJ Rep 99. Judge ad hoc Gaja focused on the tort exception and concluded that \n\u2018at least for certain decisions of Italian courts, the exercise of jurisdiction could not be regarded as being in \nbreach of an obligation under general international law\u2019 (\u00a712). \n\n\n\n145  \n\npursued, the whole reasoning in its treatment of issues of substance, as well as the \n\nconclusions of the Judgment.\u2019462  \n\nParaphrasing Voltaire, Andrea Bianchi said that \u2018[i]f Can\u00e7ado did not exist, it \n\nwould be necessary to invent him.\u2019463 The lengthy dissenting opinion Judge Can\u00e7ado \n\nTrindade annexed to the judgment of the ICJ is a testament to the flexibility of \n\ninternational law and to the plurality of views international legal argumentation can \n\naccommodate. Indeed, the contrast between his dissenting opinion and the judgment of the \n\nICJ could hardly be more pronounced.  \n\nRight at the outset, Can\u00e7ado Trindade laid down the tone of his dissenting opinion, \n\nstating he was guided \u2018\u2026 by the ultimate goal precisely of the realization of justice.\u2019464 \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade emphasized more than once the importance of the factual background to \n\nthe legal issues and also the recognition by Germany of its responsibility for the serious \n\nviolations of international humanitarian law it had committed.465 It is clear Can\u00e7ado \n\nTrindade wanted to defy the notion law can be considered in a vacuum and that law can be \n\nappraised by making abstraction of the facts underlying the case. Before further advancing \n\nin his argumentation, Can\u00e7ado Trindade devoted a section of his dissenting opinion to \n\nexpose its doctrinal foundations and remarked that, in his view, valuable lessons from the \n\npast are forgotten and the legal profession has a \u2018persistent obsession of privileging \n\nstrategies of litigation over consideration of fundamental human values.\u2019466  \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade briefly analyzed the works of three jurists (Albert de La \n\nPradelle, Max Huber, Alejandro \u00c1lvarez) and picked up the elements of the doctrines of \n\nthese three authors which informed his dissenting opinion: the emphasis on fundamental \n\nhuman values, the critique of a state-centric approach to international law and the belief \n\ninternational law exists first and foremost to serve human beings.467 Can\u00e7ado Trindade \n\nunderlined his conception of international law was \u2018\u2026 quite distinct from that of the \n\nCourt\u2019s majority\u2019468 and, in his view, a \u2018strict inter-State outlook\u2019 could not suffice.

And the \n\nresponsible States are bound to provide them such reparation. A vast practice to this effect has \n\ndeveloped in recent years, in the domain of the corpus juris of the International Law of Human \n\nRights, marking\u2014being one of the multiple aspects of\u2014the emancipation of the individuals \n\nfrom their own State, in the vindication of the rights inherent to them.\u2019472 \n\n \n\nBefore considering the relationship between state immunity and jus cogens, \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade assessed the status of forced labor in international law, concluding that, \n\nat the time of World War II, it was \u2018a form of slave work \u2026 already prohibited by \n\ninternational law\u2019 and that \u2018the absolute prohibition of forced and slave work in the war \n\nindustry\u2019 had the status of jus cogens.473  \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade retorted Germany\u2019s argument that the decision to set aside state \n\nimmunity could jeopardize the structure of the international society quite eloquently:  \n\n \n                                                \n469 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [71]-[72]; Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy), \nCounter-Claim, Order of 6 July 2010 (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) [2010] ICJ Rep 310, \n[124]-[125]. \n470 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [54]. \n471 ibid [53]-[62]. \n472 ibid [70]. \n473 ibid [117]-[119]. \n\n\n\n147  \n\n\u2018In my understanding, what jeopardizes or destabilizes the international legal order are the \n\ninternational crimes, and not the individual suits for reparation in the search for justice. In my \n\nperception, what troubles the international legal order, are the cover-up of such international \n\ncrimes accompanied by the impunity of the perpetrators, and not the victims in search for \n\njustice. When a State pursues a criminal policy of murdering segments of its own population, \n\nand of the population of other States, it cannot, later on, place itself behind the shield of \n\nsovereign immunities, as these latter were never conceived for that purpose. Grave breaches of \n\nhuman rights and of international humanitarian law, amounting to international crimes, are not \n\nat all acts jure imperii. They are anti-juridical acts, they are breaches of jus cogens, that cannot \n\nsimply be removed or thrown into oblivion by reliance on State immunity. This would block \n\nthe access to justice, and impose impunity. It is, in fact, the opposite that should take place: \n\nbreaches of jus cogens bring about the removal of claims of State immunity, so that justice can \n\nbe done.\u2019474  \n\n \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade criticized the ICJ\u2019s approach of relying on decisions of national \n\ntribunals. According to him, the ICJ should have had a broader outlook on the matter and \n\nhave taken into account other sources of international law. With this consideration in mind, \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade set out to address the tension between state immunity and the right of \n\naccess to justice in the light of the concept of rule of law in the following terms:  \n\n \n\u2018The concept of rule of law moves away from the shortsightedness of legal positivism (with its \n\ncharacteristic subservience to the established power), and comes closer to the idea of an \n\n\u2018objective\u2019 justice, at national and international levels, in line with jusnaturalist legal thinking. \n\nWithin the realm of this latter, it is attentive to the protection of human rights, anterior and \n\nsuperior to the State.\u2019475 \n\n \n\nThe codification of the tort exception in the ECSI and in the UNCJISP was, \n\naccording to Can\u00e7ado Trindade, an acknowledgment that \u2018\u2026 their subject-matter [did] not \n\nexhaust itself in purely inter-State relations.\u2019476 Always criticizing what he labeled \u2018the \n\nstrict inter-State outlook\u2019 and state consent as the foundation of international law, and \n\nadvocating a return to the universalism of the founding fathers of international law, \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade put forth the view that, in the present case, the distinction between acta \n\njure imperii and acta jure gestionis was irrelevant: \n\n                                                \n474 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [129]. \n475 ibid [150]. \n476 ibid [154]. \n\n\n\n148  \n\n \n\u2018War crimes and crimes against humanity are not to be considered acta jure gestionis, or else \n\n\u201cprivate acts\u201d; they are crimes. They are not to be considered acta jure imperii either; they are \n\ngrave delicta, crimes. The distinction between acts jure imperii and acts jure gestionis, \n\nbetween sovereign or official acts of a State and acts of a private nature, is a remnant of \n\ntraditional doctrines which are wholly inadequate to the examination of the present case on the \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State before the Court. Such traditional theories, in their \n\nmyopia of State-centrism, forgot the lessons of the founding-fathers of the law of nations, \n\npointing to the acknowledgement that individuals are subjects of the law of nations (droit des \n\ngens). \n\n\u2018There is no immunity for grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian \n\nlaw, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Immunity was never conceived for such \n\niniquity. To insist on pursuing a strictly inter-State approach in the relationships of \n\nresponsibility leads to manifest injustice. The present case of the Jurisdictional Immunities of \n\nthe State (Germany versus Italy, Greece intervening) gives eloquent testimony of this.\u2019477  \n\n \n\nBeing delicta imperii, ie international crimes in breach of jus cogens, the grant of \n\nimmunity to Germany would be, according to Can\u00e7ado Trindade, inadmissible.478  \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade then turned to the question of access to justice. Can\u00e7ado \n\nTrindade considers that the right of access to justice has to be viewed in its essence of a \n\nfundamental right, and not, like the ECtHR does, from the standpoint of permissible \n\nlimitations. As famously stated by the ECtHR in Golder v United Kingdom, \u2018the right of \n\naccess to the courts is not absolute \u2026 there is room, apart from the bounds delimiting the \n\nvery content of any right, for limitations permitted by implication.\u2019479 In Ashingdane v \n\nUnited Kingdom, the ECtHR enumerated the requirements that must be fulfilled for lawful \n\nlimitations of this right: (i) the limitations applied must not restrict or reduce the right of \n\naccess to court in a way that impairs \u2018the very essence of the right\u2019; (ii) they have to pursue \n\na \u2018legitimate aim\u2019; and (iii) there must be a \u2018reasonable relationship of proportionality \n\nbetween the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.\u2019480 According to Can\u00e7ado \n\nTrindade, the IACtHR has a more sensible approach to the right of access to justice \n\n                                                \n477 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [178]-[179]. \n478 ibid [184]. \n479  Golder v United Kingdom [Plenary] (Application No 4451/70) (Merits: Judgment) (1975) \n<http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57496> accessed 26 November 2015, [38]. \n480  Ashingdane v United Kingdom [Chamber] (Application No 8225/78) (Merits: Judgment) (1985) \n<http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57425> accessed 26 November 2015, [57]. \n\n\n\n149  \n\n(enshrined in Articles 8 and 25 of the ACHR). The judge recalled the case Goiburu et al v \n\nParaguay, in which the IACtHR stated that  \n\n \n\u2018El acceso a la justicia constituye una norma imperativa de Derecho Internacional y, como tal, \n\ngenera obligaciones erga omnes para los Estados de adoptar las medidas que sean necesarias \n\npara no dejar en la impunidad esas violaciones, ya sea ejerciendo su jurisdicci\u00f3n para aplicar su \n\nderecho interno y el derecho internacional para juzgar y, en su caso, sancionar a los \n\nresponsables, o colaborando con otros Estados que lo hagan o procuren hacerlo.\u2019481 \n\n \n\nAccordingly, in this respect, Can\u00e7ado Trindade concluded the following: \n\n \n\u2018[The right of access to justice] assumes an imperative character in face of a crime of State: it \n\nis a true droit au Droit, a right to a legal order which effectively protects the fundamental \n\nrights of the human person\u2026 We are here, in sum, in the domain of jus cogens.\u2019482  \n\n \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade lamented the fact that the text of the UNCJISP remained silent \n\nin respect of the incidence of jus cogens and did not address the problem of the \n\nrelationship between state immunity and serious breaches of international humanitarian \n\nlaw and human rights law.483 Indeed, the Working Group of the Sixth Committee of the \n\nUNGA, in a document pertaining to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of the UNCJISP, declared \n\nthat \u2018\u2026 the question of the existence or non-existence of immunity in the case of violation \n\nby a State of jus cogens norms of international law \u2026 did not seem to be ripe enough for \n\nthe Working Group to engage in a codification exercise over it.\u2019484 Can\u00e7ado Trindade \n\nremarked that both the ECtHR in Al-Adsani and, after over a decade apart, the ICJ in \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State used this \u2018omission\u2019 in the reasoning of their \n\ndecisions. In his view, these judgments had the effect of \u2018freezing\u2019 international law.485 \n\nIt was not left unobserved by Can\u00e7ado Trindade one of the most acute \n\ncontradictions of the regime of state immunity:  \n\n                                                \n481 Goiburu et al v Paraguay (Merits, Reparations and Costs) Inter-American Court of Human Rights Series \nC No 153 (22 September 2006), [131]. \n482 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [217]. \n483 ibid [221]-[226]. \n484  \u2018Report of the Chairman of the Working Group\u2019 (12 November 1999) A/C.6/54/L.12, [46]-[47]; \nJurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of Judge \nCan\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [224]-[226]. \n485 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [226]. In his words: \u2018I cannot at all accept that contemporary international \nlaw can thereby be \u201cfrozen\u201d.\u2019 \n\n\n\n150  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 to admit the removal of State immunity in the realm of trade relations, or in respect of local \n\npersonal tort (e.g., in traffic accidents), and at the same time to insist on shielding States with \n\nimmunity, in cases of international crimes marked by grave violations of human rights and of \n\ninternational humanitarian law in pursuance of State (criminal) policies, in my perception \n\namounts to a juridical absurdity.\u2019486 \n\n \n\nIn another step of his dissenting opinion, Can\u00e7ado Trindade sought to demonstrate \n\nthe existence under international law of an individual right to reparation for the victims of \n\ngrave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law: \n\n \n\u2018An interpretation of the regime of reparations as belonging purely to the inter-State level \n\nwould furthermore equate to a complete misconception of the position of the individual in the \n\ninternational legal order.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 [T]he regime of reparations for grave breaches of human rights and of international \n\nhumanitarian law cannot possibly exhaust itself at the inter-State level, wherein the individual \n\nis left at the end without any reparation at all.\u2019487  \n\n \n\nThis right to reparation, according to him, leads ultimately to the impossibility of \n\ninvoking state immunity in order to be exempt from the duty to provide reparation for the \n\nvictims.488  \n\nLastly, Can\u00e7ado Trindade devoted a section of his dissenting opinion to assess the \n\nimpact of jus cogens in the case. Again he expressed his concern that the ICJ was \n\ncontributing to keep international law \u2018frozen\u2019 and \u2018stagnated\u2019.489 The judge criticized the \n\npositivist methodology employed by the ICJ, which relied on \u2018an empirical factual exercise \n\nof identifying the incongruous case-law of national courts and the inconsistent practice of \n\nnational legislations on the subject-matter at issue\u2019490. According to Can\u00e7ado Trindade, \n\nthese are \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 positivist exercises leading to the fossilization of international law, and disclosing its \n\npersistent underdevelopment, rather than its progressive development, as one would expect. \n\nSuch undue methodology is coupled with inadequate and unpersuasive conceptualizations, of \n                                                \n486 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [239]. \n487 ibid [252]. \n488 ibid [254]. \n489 ibid [288]. \n490 ibid [293]. \n\n\n\n151  \n\nthe kind of the ones so widespread in the legal profession, such as, inter alia, the \n\ncounterpositions of \u201cprimary\u201d to \u201csecondary\u201d rules, or of \u201cprocedural\u201d to \u201csubstantive\u201d rules, \n\nor of obligations of \u201cconduct\u201d to those of \u201cresult\u201d.\u2019491  \n\n \n\nAs discussed previously, one of the pivotal points of the ICJ\u2019s decision in \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State was the contention that there was no conflict \n\nbetween jus cogens norms (considered \u2018substantive\u2019 in nature) and the norms of state \n\nimmunity (characterized by the Court as \u2018procedural\u2019). Can\u00e7ado Trindade strongly \n\ncriticized this approach: \n\n \n\u2018To me, the separation between procedural and substantive law is not ontologically nor \n\ndeontologically viable: la forme conforme le fond. Legal procedure is not an end in itself, it is a \n\nmeans to the realization of justice. And the application of substantive law is finaliste, it \n\npurports to have justice done.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 There is thus a material conflict, even though a formalist one may not be discernible. The \n\nfact remains that a conflict does exist, and the Court\u2019s reasoning leads to what I perceive as a \n\ngroundless deconstruction of jus cogens, depriving this latter of its effects and legal \n\nconsequences.\u2019492 \n\n \n\nAt one point, in paragraph 294 of his dissenting opinion, Can\u00e7ado Trindade asked: \n\n\u2018Words, words, words \u2026 Where are the values?\u2019493 This question indeed encapsulates \n\nCan\u00e7ado Trindade\u2019s perspective of international law, which privileges fundamental human \n\nvalues and the realization of justice.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n491 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) (n 462) [294]. \n492 ibid [295]-[296]. \n493 ibid [294]. \n\n\n\n152  \n\n3.4 Decisions rendered by national courts after Jurisdictional Immunities of the State  \n\n \n\n3.4.1 Italy \n\n \n\n3.4.1.1 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in the Albers case (2012) \n\n \n\nAfter the ICJ\u2019s judgment of 3 February 2012 in Jurisdictional Immunities of the \n\nState, the Court of Cassation had once again the opportunity to dwell on the issue of state \n\nimmunity in cases of a breach of peremptory norms of international law.  \n\nThe first judgment concerning the Albers case was handed down on 26 June 2009 \n\nby the Tribunale Militare di Roma, which condemned to life imprisonment nine German \n\ncitizens (Albers Paul, Baumann Joseph, Bichler Hubert, Kusterer Wilhelm Ernst, Rosler \n\nArnold, Schneider Adolf, Schneider Max, Trager Heinz-Fritz, Wulf Helmut) who had \n\nbelonged to the XVI SS Panzergrenadier Division.494 They had taken part in a massacre \n\nthat occurred in Italy involving the death of about 350 Italian citizens not engaged in \n\nmilitary operations, among women, children and the elderly.495 Based on the Court of \n\nCassation\u2019s previous judgments496, the Corte Militare di Appello partially upheld the first-\n\ninstance judgment. One of the accused, Rosler Arnold, was acquitted, and four others \n\n(Albers Paul, Bichler Hubert, Schneider Adolf, Trager Heinz-Fritz) had died before the \n\njudgment and therefore had their criminal liability extinguished.497 The Court also upheld \n\nthe civil claims except with respect to Rosler Arnold, Albers Paul, Bichler Hubert, \n\nSchneider Adolf, and Trager Heinz-Fritz.498 The Corte Militare di Appello had also held \n\nGermany civilly liable and, as a result, on 23 June 2011, Germany appealed to the Court of \n\nCassation protesting Italy\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction.499  \n\nGermany argued the principle of access to justice for the victims of gross violations \n\nof human rights did not prevail over the rule of state immunity from civil jurisdiction and \n\nthat, in any case, the right to obtain civil compensation for damages arising from these \n\n                                                \n494 Military Prosecutor v Albers and others and Germany (Case No 32139/2012) (9 August 2012) ILDC \n1921 (Italian Court of Cassation), [Ritenuto in fatto, 1]. The ILDC database includes a summary and an \nanalysis of Albers written by Daniele Amoroso.  \n495 ibid. \n496 Reference is made to Ferrini v Germany and the group of identical decisions rendered on 29 May 2008, \nsuch as Mantelli and Others v Germany. \n497 Military Prosecutor v Albers (n 494) [Ritenuto in fatto, 1]. \n498 ibid. \n499 ibid [Ritenuto in fatto, 4]. \n\n\n\n153  \n\nbreaches was not part of the body of jus cogens.500 Germany pointed out that, in its view, \n\nthe decisions rendered by the Italian courts contrasted with international practice and that \n\nthe arguments employed in the different decisions were not consistent among themselves,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 ora facendosi riferimento all\u2019emersione di una regola non ancora sorretta dalla prassi \n\ninternazionale, ora richiamando una tendenza evolutiva nella dottrina internazionalistica e in \n\nuna parte ancora minoritaria della giurisprudenza interna ovvero una consuetudine \n\ninternazionale in via di formazione, ora utilizzando il criterio del bilanciamento di interessi, ora \n\nfacendo leva sul metodo qualitativo di rilevazione della consuetudine internazionale e \n\nprivilegiando, con argomenti che si assumono in ordine sistematico e logico, la prassi \n\nqualitativamente superiore seppure minoritaria.\u2019501 \n\n \n\n The Court of Cassation strongly criticized the ICJ\u2019s judgment in Jurisdictional \n\nImmunities of the State. As previously mentioned, the ICJ held that there was no conflict \n\nbetween the customary norm which requires one state to accord immunity to another and \n\njus cogens norms. To the Court of Cassation, it seemed \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 indebitamente riduttivo confinare la categoria dello jus cogens alla sua sola portata \n\nsostanziale, ignorando che la sua effettivit\u00e0 concreta si mistura proprio alla stregua delle \n\nconseguenze giuridiche che derivano dalla violazione delle norme imperative. E\u2013\u2013d\u2019altro \n\ncanto\u2013\u2013non appare marginale considerare che proprio la predicata distinzione tra norme           \n\n\u00ab sostanziali \u00bb e \u00ab procedurali \u00bb cagiona null\u2019altro che l\u2019impunit\u00e0 dei soggetti e finisce per \n\nriaffermare la poca persuasiva attrazione, nella sfera della esenzione dalla giurisdizione, \n\npropria degli atti adottati jure imperii, di atti quali i crimini contro l\u2019umanit\u00e0 che in quella \n\ncategoria stentano ad essere ricompresi.\u2019502 \n\n \n\n Nevertheless, the Court of Cassation conceded it had to take into account the ICJ\u2019s \n\njudgment due to its \u2018indiscutibile autorevolezza\u2019 and its \u2018non assenti tratti di \n\npersuasivit\u00e0\u2019. 503  As a matter of fact, the Court of Cassation went beyond that and \n\nconsidered the pronouncement of the ICJ should be examined \u2018come dictum del Giudice \n\ninternazionale ben prima che come fonte di una soluzione giuridica dotata di elevata \n\n                                                \n500 Military Prosecutor v Albers (n 494) [Ritenuto in fatto, 6]. \n501 ibid. \n502 ibid [Considerato in diritto, 5].  \n503 ibid. \n\n\n\n154  \n\nplausibilit\u00e0\u2019.504 In the Court of Cassation\u2019s view, the judgment of the ICJ was owed \n\ndeference due to being a dictum of the international judge and because it expressed the lack \n\nof support of the international community with regard to the position adopted by the Italian \n\ncourts. The Court of Cassation remained, however, convinced of the soundness of its \n\nprevious decisions and hopeful that its position would be adopted in the future:  \n\n \n\u2018E pertanto, se \u00e8 ben vero che non \u00e8 dato desumere dalla statuizione della Corte internazionale \n\nargomenti in grado di sconfessare la persuasivit\u00e0 e solidit\u00e0 giuridica dei principi fino ad ora \n\naffermati da questa Corte, tale statuizione, nel rammentato quadro di sostanziale isolamento \n\ndella posizione del Giudice italiano, consiglia certamente di valutare le statuizioni del 2004 e \n\ndel 2008\u2014espressamente intese come fonti di un contributo \u201call\u2019emersione di una regola \n\nconformativa dell\u2019immunit\u00e0 dello Stato estero\u201d\u2014come un tentativo, dettato da esigenze di \n\naffermazione di principi di civilt\u00e0 giuridica, che, in difetto della sua \u201cconvalida\u201d da parte della \n\nComunit\u00e0 internazionale della quale la Corte dell\u2019Aja \u00e8 il massimo momento di sintesi \n\ngiurisdizionale, non \u00e8 stato, o non \u00e8 stato ancora, fornito della necessaria condivisione, e che, \n\nper questa ineluttabile considerazione, non pu\u00f2 essere portato ad ulteriori applicazioni.  \n\n\u2018Le espressioni di pieno consenso alle posizioni della Corte italiana da parte di autorevole parte \n\ndella dottrina e lo stesso sintomatico emergere di opinioni dissenzienti nella pronunzia della \n\nCorte internazionale non fanno escludere che in avvenire il principio del necessario ritrarsi \n\ndella immunit\u00e0 per gli Stati che agiscano jure imperii quando l\u2019azione incida sui diritti \n\nindividuali di rilievo primario per i cittadini possa essere in tutto o in parte acquisito dalla \n\nComunit\u00e0 internazionale. Ma allo stato ci\u00f2 non \u00e8.\u2019505 \n\n \n\n The Court of Cassation pointed out the ICJ held Italy had incurred international \n\nresponsibility and had to restore the situation which existed before the wrongful acts were \n\ncommitted.506 The Court of Cassation highlighted it was left to Italy to choose the means to \n\nimplement its obligations, given the \u2018\u2026 totale autonomia della funzione giurisdizionale \u2026 \n\nda vincoli diretti ed immediati scaturenti dal dictum della Corte Internazionale\u2019.507 The \n\nCourt of Cassation chose, however, to comply with the ICJ\u2019s ruling and to annul the \n\ndecision of the Corte Militare di Appello. The Court added the recognition of Germany\u2019s \n\nentitlement to immunity from suits based on violations of fundamental rights would not \n\n                                                \n504 Military Prosecutor v Albers (n 494) [Considerato in diritto, 6]. See Filippo Fontanelli, \u2018Criminal \nProceedings against Albers\u2019 (2013) 107(3) AJIL 632, 634. Fontanelli remarked that, in an implicit way, the \nCourt of Cassation equated the ICJ\u2019s judgment to a source of law.  \n505 Military Prosecutor v Albers (n 494) [Considerato in diritto, 6]. \n506 ibid. \n507 ibid. \n\n\n\n155  \n\nraise a question of constitutionality.508 It recalled Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution \n\nprovided for the automatic conformity of the Italian legal system with international law. \n\nHence customary international law assumed the role of a primary source of law and the \n\ncorresponding norms were subordinated only to the Italian Constitution, being \u2018norme \n\ninterposte\u2019. Rather cryptically, the Court of Cassation added that, since it was inaccurate in \n\nthe ascertainment of custom in previous cases, the custom it had once conceived did not \n\nproduce \u2018norme interposte\u2019 and that would render a question of constitutionality \n\nimmaterial.509 \n\n \n\n3.4.1.2 Judgment No 238 of the Italian Court of Cassation (2014)  \n\n \n\n This time, the Court of Cassation was seized with a request by the Tribunal of \n\nFlorence to decide on the constitutionality of various norms of Italian law related to the \n\nimplementation of the ICJ\u2019s ruling in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State and to the \n\ninternalization of the UNCJISP 2004. Said referral had its origin in three different cases in \n\nwhich the subject-matter was again whether the Italian legal system required Italian courts \n\nto grant immunity to a foreign state in respect of proceedings seeking damages in cases \n\ninvolving the perpetration by Germany of war crimes and crimes against humanity in \n\nItalian territory.510  \n\n                                                \n508 Military Prosecutor v Albers (n 494) [Considerato in diritto, 6]. \n509 ibid: \u2018\u2026 il diniego della attuale sussistenza di una consuetudine internazionale quale quella divisata a suo \ntempo dalle Sezioni Unite di questa Corte comporta necessariamente l\u2019inesistenza delle \u201cnorme interposte\u201d e \nfa venir meno, di necessit\u00e0, alcuna rilevanza al dubbio stesso di illegittimit\u00e0 costituzionale.\u2019 See also \nFontanelli (n 504) 638 (footnotes omitted): \n \n\n\u2018In Albers, the Court of Cassation opined that, since the custom envisaged in Ferrini does not \nin fact exist, no issue of constitutionality can arise \u2026 This passage is elliptical, as it fails to \nspecify which statutory act was suspected of breaching the alleged custom. Perhaps it refers to \na conflict between the statutes enjoining Italian courts to decline jurisdiction and the Ferrini \nprinciple, elevated to a constitutional standard under Article 10 of the Constitution. Perhaps the \nCourt was referring to another\u2014more radical\u2014 conflict adumbrated by the plaintiffs, between \nimmunity and constitutional counterlimits.

As pointed out by \n\nthe Tribunal of Florence, in the proceedings, Germany requested the Italian judge to give \n\neffect to the decision rendered by the ICJ and to declare lack of jurisdiction.511 Also, the \n\nItalian Court of Cassation itself had departed from the standard crafted in Ferrini v \n\nGermany (eg, in the Albers case, which was examined in the previous section of this \n\nmonograph), and the Italian state had made efforts to conform to the ICJ\u2019s ruling.512 \n\nArticle 3513 of Law No 5 of 14 January 2013 (\u2018Adesione della Repubblica italiana alla \n\nConvenzione delle Nazioni Unite sulle immunit\u00e0 giurisdizionali degli Stati e dei loro beni, \n\nfatta a New York il 2 dicembre 2004, nonch\u00e8 norme di adeguamento all\u2019ordinamento \n\ninterno\u2019) established Italian judges had to comply with the ruling of the ICJ. This Article \n\nalso provided even final judgments already rendered by the Italian courts which contrasted \n\nwith the decision of the ICJ could be revised (\u2018impugnate per revocazione\u2019).  \n\n The Tribunal of Florence pointed out it was undisputed that the facts underlying the \n\nclaims had the nature of international crimes.514 At the same time, it conceded to the \n\nauthoritativeness of the pronouncements of the ICJ and assumed that there was no conflict \n\nbetween jus cogens norms and state immunity, that the crimes perpetrated by the German \n\nReich were jure imperii and that customary international law recognized state immunity \n\nwas applicable in civil proceedings even for international crimes committed by the armed \n\nforces and other organs of a state in the territory of the forum state.515 The argument of the \n\n                                                \n511 Judgment No 238/2014 (n 510) [Ritenuto in fatto, 1.1]. \n512 ibid [Ritenuto in fatto, 1.2]. \n513 Legge 14 gennaio 2013, No 5 (\u2018Adesione della Repubblica italiana alla Convenzione delle Nazioni Unite \nsulle immunit\u00e0 giurisdizionali degli Stati e dei loro beni, fatta a New York il 2 dicembre 2004, nonch\u00e8 norme \ndi adeguamento all\u2019ordinamento interno\u2019) \n&lt;http://www.normattiva.it/atto/caricaDettaglioAtto?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2013-01-\n29&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=13G00023&amp;currentPage=1> accessed 26 November 2015: \n \n\n\u2018Art. 3\u2013\u2013Esecuzione delle sentenze della Corte internazionale di giustizia: 1.

The Court of Cassation, \n\nrelying on another decision (Judgment No 1/1956)519, expressed a different position and \n\n                                                \n516 Judgment No 238/2014 (n 510) [Ritenuto in fatto, 1.2]. \n517 See Filippo Fontanelli, \u2018I know it\u2019s wrong but I just can\u2019t do right.

The Court of Cassation considered domestic judges should adopt \n\nthe \u2018principle of conformity\u2019 and follow the interpretation of international law as adopted \n\nat the international level.523 The ICJ having defined the scope of the norm of state \n\nimmunity, the Court of Cassation was called to pronounce itself on the compatibility of the \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n\n\u2018L\u2019assunto che il nuovo istituto della \u201cillegittimit\u00e0 costituzionale\u201d si riferisca solo alle leggi \nposteriori alla Costituzione e non anche a quelle anteriori non pu\u00f2 essere accolto, sia perch\u00e9, \ndal lato testuale, tanto l\u2019art. 134 della Costituzione quanto l\u2019art. 1 della legge costituzionale 9 \nfebbraio 1948, n. 1, parlano di questioni di legittimit\u00e0 costituzionale delle leggi, senza fare \nalcuna distinzione, sia perch\u00e9, dal lato logico, \u00e8 innegabile che il rapporto tra leggi ordinarie e \nleggi costituzionali e il grado che ad esse rispettivamente spetta nella gerarchia delle fonti non \nmutano affatto, siano le leggi ordinarie anteriori, siano posteriori a quelle costituzionali\u2019. \n\n \n520 Judgment No 238/2014 (n 510) [Ritenuto in diritto, 2.1]: \n \n\n\u2018E qui oggi si riconosce, pertanto, che il principio affermato nella appena ricordata sentenza n. \n1 del 1956, secondo il quale il controllo di legittimit\u00e0 costituzionale riguarda sia norme \nposteriori che norme anteriori alla Costituzione repubblicana, vale anche per le norme del \ndiritto internazionale generalmente riconosciute di cui al meccanismo di adattamento \nautomatico dell\u2019art. 10, primo comma, Cost. che si siano formate prima o dopo la Costituzione. \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u2018In definitiva, non sussistono, sul piano logico e sistematico, ragioni per le quali il controllo di \nlegittimit\u00e0 costituzionale dovrebbe essere escluso per le consuetudini internazionali o limitato \nsolo a quelle posteriori alla Costituzione, tenuto conto che a queste ultime \u00e8 riconosciuta la \nmedesima efficacia delle consuetudini formatesi in epoca precedente ed il medesimo limite del \nrispetto degli elementi identificativi dell\u2019ordinamento costituzionale, vale a dire dei principi \nfondamentali e dei diritti inviolabili della persona.\u2019 \n\n \n521 ibid [Ritenuto in diritto, 2.2]. \n522 ibid. \n523 ibid [Ritenuto in diritto, 3.1]. \n\n\n\n159  \n\ndomestic norm created by virtue of Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution and which \n\nmirrors the customary international norm in question with the norms and principles of the \n\nItalian Constitution, specifically Articles 2524 (protection of fundamental human rights) and \n\n24525 (right of access to justice).526  \n\nThe Court of Cassation then highlighted the role of national courts in the transition \n\nfrom the absolute doctrine to the restrictive doctrine of state immunity and the later \n\nrecognition of this practice by international organs in the process of identifying customary \n\ninternational law. 527  The Court of Cassation argued that the respect to the Italian \n\nConstitution had the effect of further restricting the scope of state immunity and that, \n\nalthough this effect was limited to the Italian legal system, it could concur \u2018ad \n\nun\u2019auspicabile e da pi\u00f9 parti auspicata evoluzione dello stesso diritto internazionale.\u2019528 \n\nUnlike the ICJ, which established a stark distinction between procedural and substantive \n\nrules, the Court of Cassation considered that Articles 2 and 24 of the Italian Constitution \n\nare \u2018inestricabilmente connessi\u2019, ie it considered there is an intimate connection between \n\nthe protection of human rights and the right of access to court529. Recalling its case-law, \n\nthe Court of Cassation asserted that limits to the right of access to justice had to be justified \n\nby a \u2018a public interest\u2019. 530  The Court of Cassation could not find in the Italian \n\nConstitutional order a public interest able to justify a norm which requires the \u2018complete \n\nsacrifice\u2019 of the right of access to court in cases in which damages are sought by victims of \n\ncrimes against humanity and gross violation of human rights.531  \n\n                                                \n524 Costituzione della Repubblica Italiana&lt;http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:costituzione> \naccessed 26 November 2015: \n \n\n \u2018Art. 2\u2013\u2013La Repubblica riconosce e garantisce i diritti inviolabili dell'uomo, sia come singolo \nsia nelle formazioni sociali ove si svolge la sua personalit\u00e0, e richiede l'adempimento dei \ndoveri inderogabili di solidariet\u00e0 politica, economica e sociale.\u2019 \n\n \n525 ibid: \n \n\n\u2018Art. 24\u2013\u20131.

Such deferral, nonetheless, amounted to lip service. In a formal \n\nfashion, the Court of Cassation concluded that the international norm granting \n\njurisdictional immunity to states in respect of egregious violations of human rights had \n\nnever entered the Italian legal system in the first place. Since it is in conflict with Articles \n\n2 and 24 of the Italian Constitution, the operation of Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution \n\nwas precluded in this situation, and the international norm did not produce a domestic \n\nnorm with the same content.534  \n\n Article 1 of Law No 848/1957, which gave \u2018full and complete execution\u2019 to the UN \n\nCharter and, in particular, to Article 94 of the UN Charter, which requires Member States \n\n\u2018\u2026 to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice in any case to which it \n\nis a party\u2019, was also deemed to be in breach of Articles 2 and 24 of the Italian Constitution, \n\nbut only insofar as it required compliance with the judgment of the ICJ in Jurisdictional \n\n                                                \n532 Judgment No 238/2014 (n 510) [Ritenuto in diritto, 3.4]. \n533 ibid. \n534 ibid [Ritenuto in diritto, 3.5]. \n\n\n\n161  \n\nImmunities of the State.535 The Court of Cassation highlighted its decision did not impact \n\nany other obligations imposed by the UN Charter on Italy, including the duty to comply \n\nwith other decisions of the ICJ.536  \n\n Finally, on the same grounds, the Court of Cassation also declared unconstitutional \n\nArticle 3 of Law No 5/2013, which had been adopted to enable compliance with the ruling \n\nof the ICJ.  \n\nIn order to justify its dualistic position, the Court of Cassation made reference to \n\nthe Kadi I case.537 This case concerned the setting up, by the UNSC, of a sanctions regime \n\ntargeting individuals suspected to be associated with international terrorism. This sanctions \n\nregime imposed, inter alia, the freezing of assets of listed individuals without regard to \n\nbasic guarantees, such as the right to be heard and the right to effective judicial protection. \n\nMr Kadi and Al Barakaat brought proceedings before the CFI seeking the annulment of \n\ncertain EU Regulations implementing SC Resolutions linked to the sanctions regime in \n\nquestion. Ultimately, the ECJ adopted an essentially dualist approach, dismissing the \n\npossibility of reviewing a SC Resolution even if it were in breach of jus cogens.538 This \n\nwould not, nevertheless, limit in any way its capacity to fully review measures emanating \n\nfrom the European legal system\u2014quite the opposite: according to the ECJ, the system set \n\nout by the UN Charter does not prohibit any judicial review of the internal lawfulness of \n\ncontested EU Regulations in the light of the fundamental freedoms of the European legal \n\nsystem, even if the Regulations in question are intended to give effect to a SC Resolution \n\nadopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. As well said by Antonios Tzanakopoulos, \n\nthe ECJ put states in an awkward situation, insofar as they have to choose either to obey \n\nthe ruling of the ECJ or the SC.539 In a similar way, in Judgment No 238/2014, the Italian \n\n                                                \n535 Judgment No 238/2014 (n 510) [Ritenuto in diritto, 4.1]; Charter of the United Nations with the Statute of \nthe International Court of Justice annexed thereto (adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October \n1945) 1 UNTS xvi; Legge 17 agosto 1957, No 848 (\u2018Esecuzione dello Statuto delle Nazioni Unite, firmato a \nSan Francisco il 26 giugno 1945\u2019) \n<http://www.normattiva.it/atto/caricaDettaglioAtto?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=1957-09-\n25&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=057U0848&amp;currentPage=1> accessed 26 November 2015.  \n536 Judgment No 238/2014 (n 510) [Ritenuto in diritto, 4.1]. \n537 Case T-315/01 Yassin Abdullah Kadi v Council of the European Union and Commission of the European \nCommunities [2005] ECR II-3649; Case T-306/01 Ahmed Ali Yusuf and Al Barakaat International \nFoundation v Council of the European Union and Commission of the European Communities [2005] ECR II-\n3533; Joined Cases C-402/05 P and C-415/05 P Yassin Abdullah Kadi and Al Barakaat International \nFoundation v Council of the European Union and Commission of the European Communities (Judgment \n[Grand Chamber]) [2008] ECR I-6351. \n538 See Katja S.

It found the right of access to \n\ncourt was not absolute and it could be subject to limitations. Contracting States have a \n\nmargin of appreciation in respect of the limitations, but the ECtHR has the final word in \n\n                                                \n540 European Convention on Human Rights (n 374): \n \n\n\u2018Article 6\u2013\u2013Right to a fair trial\u2013\u20131.

It found that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 sovereign immunity is a concept of international law, developed out of the principle par in \n\nparem non habet imperium, by virtue of which one State shall not be subject to the jurisdiction \n\nof another State. The grant of sovereign immunity to a State in civil proceedings pursues the \n\nlegitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and good relations \n\nbetween States through the respect of another State\u2019s sovereignty. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [T]he need to interpret the Convention so far as possible in harmony with other rules of \n\ninternational law of which it forms part, including those relating to the grant of State immunity, \n\nhas led to the Court to conclude that measures taken by a State which reflect generally \n\nrecognised rules of public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded \n\nas imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in \n\nArticle 6 \u00a7 1.\u2019543 \n\n \n\nThe ECtHR emphasized that it had held in Al-Adsani that there was not yet \n\nacceptance in international law for the proposition that states were not entitled to immunity \n\nin respect of civil claims arising out of alleged acts of torture that were not committed in \n\nthe territory of the forum state\u2014accordingly, in the case, the United Kingdom was found \n\nnot to have violated Article 6.1 of the ECHR for having granted immunity to Kuwait. The \n\nsame conclusion was reached later in Kalogeropoulou. Since the ECtHR had left open the \n\npossibility of further developments in customary international law, the next step it took \n\nwas to consider whether the approach adopted in Al-Adsani should be revisited. The Court \n\ndid not develop its reasoning, merely mentioning that the approach adopted in respect of \n\nthe proportionality test under Article 6.1 in Al-Adsani involved its obligation \u2018to take \n\naccount of the relevant rules and principles of international law and to interpret the \n\n[ECHR] so far as possible in harmony with other rules of international law of which it \n\nforms part\u2019\u2014and, as asserted by the ECtHR in Al-Adsani, these rules include the \n\n                                                \n542 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [186]. \n543 ibid [188]-[189]. \n\n\n\n164  \n\n\u2018generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity\u2019.544 Without \n\nfurther considerations, the ECtHR limited itself to state that it was \u2018satisfied that the \n\napproach to proportionality set out by the Grand Chamber in Al-Adsani \u2026 ought to be \n\nfollowed.\u2019545 \n\nThe ECtHR highlighted the similarities between Mr Jones\u2019s claim regarding the \n\ngrant of state immunity to Saudi Arabia and the material facts underlying the Al-Adsani \n\ncase. Accordingly, the ECtHR considered that, if in Al-Adsani, it had held that the grant of \n\nimmunity pursed a legitimate aim (namely, \u2018complying with international law to promote \n\ncomity and good relations between States through the respect of another State\u2019s \n\nsovereignty\u2019) and was proportionate (because the ECHR has to be as far as possible \n\ninterpreted in harmony with other rules of international law and the measures taken by a \n\nstate which reflect generally recognized rules of public international law on state immunity \n\ncould not be considered in principle as imposing a disproportionate restriction on Article \n\n6.1),546 it could only do otherwise in this case if at the time the House of Lords rendered its \n\ndecision in 2006 there had already been  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 an evolution in the accepted international standards as regards the existence of a torture \n\nexception to the doctrine of State immunity \u2026 such as to warrant the conclusion that the grant \n\nof immunity in [the] case did not reflect generally recognised rules of public international law \n\non State immunity.\u2019547  \n\n \n\nThe ECtHR mentioned cases decided by domestic courts in which the issue was \n\nwhether there was a jus cogens exception to state immunity in civil claims against the \n\nstate, but decided not to proceed to a closer examination of the reasoning employed in \n\nthese judgments. Instead, the ECtHR decided to defer to the position taken by the ICJ in \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State, according to which a jus cogens exception to state \n\nimmunity had not yet emerged:  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the recent judgment of the International Court of Justice in Germany v. Italy \u2026 \u2014which \n\nmust be considered by this Court as authoritative as regards the content of customary \n\ninternational law\u2014clearly establishes that, by February 2012, no jus cogens exception to State \n\nimmunity had yet crystallised. The application by the English courts of the provisions of the \n\n                                                \n544 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [195]; Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (n 378) [55]. \n545 ibid [195]. \n546 Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (n 378) [52]-[56].  \n547 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [196]. \n\n\n\n165  \n\n1978 Act to uphold the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s claim to immunity in 2006 cannot \n\ntherefore be said to have amounted to an unjustified restriction on the applicant\u2019s access to a \n\ncourt. It follows that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards \n\nthe striking out of Mr Jones\u2019 complaint against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u2019548 \n\n \n\nNext, the ECtHR moved to the question of whether the grant of immunity ratione \n\nmateriae to state officials was compatible with Article 6.1 of the ECHR. The ECtHR, like \n\nthe House of Lords, deemed the immunity of state officials symmetrical to the immunity of \n\nthe state itself.549 Therefore, it considered that the grant of immunity to state officials was \n\nprima facie legitimate and proportionate:  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the immunity which is applied in a case against State officials remains \u201cState\u201d immunity: it \n\nis invoked by the State and can be waived by the State. Where, as in the present case, the grant \n\nof immunity ratione materiae to officials was intended to comply with international law on \n\nState immunity, then as in the case where immunity is granted to the State itself, the aim of the \n\nlimitation on access to court is legitimate. \n\n\u2018Since measures which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law on State \n\nimmunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the \n\nright of access to a court, the sole matter for consideration in respect of the applicants\u2019 \n\ncomplaint is whether the grant of immunity ratione materiae to the State officials reflected \n\nsuch rules.\u2019550 \n\n \n\nAccordingly, in order to assess whether the limitation on Article 6.1 was \n\nproportionate, the ECtHR had to confirm the limitation in question reflected general rules \n\nof international law, ie it had to establish the existence of a rule requiring domestic courts \n\nto grant immunity to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s claim in respect of its officials and \n\n                                                \n548 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [198]. \n549  See Philippa Webb, \u2018Jones v UK: The Re-Integration Of State And Official Immunity?\u2019 \n<http://www.ejiltalk.org/jones-v-uk-the-re-integration-of-state-and-official-immunity/> accessed 26 \nNovember 2015:  \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 [T]he decision in Jones to uphold the immunity of the State officials even in the face of \nallegations of torture \u2026 stretches the meaning of the ICJ Jurisdictional Immunities Judgment \nand goes against two emerging trends: (1) accountability of non-high ranking State officials for \nserious human rights violations; (2) the diversification of various forms of immunity.  \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u2018Jones v UK puts the brakes on the independent evolution of the immunity of State officials by \nre-integrating or re-aligning that immunity with that of the State.\u2019 \n \n\n550 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [200]-[201]. \n\n\n\n166  \n\nalso whether there was an exception to the general rule in respect of claims arising from \n\nalleged acts of torture.  \n\nThe ECtHR considered that it had accepted that the grant of immunity to the state \n\nitself reflected generally recognized rules of public international law. It added to its \n\nreasoning that acts cannot be practiced by the state itself, but only by individuals\u2014in the \n\nwords of the ECtHR, \u2018an act cannot be carried out by a State itself but only by individuals \n\nacting on the State\u2019s behalf\u2019551. Therefore, in the ECtHR\u2019s reasoning, whenever the state \n\nitself can invoke immunity, then, in principle, state officials must be able to invoke \n\nimmunity ratione materiae. As the ECtHR put it, \u2018[i]f it were otherwise, State immunity \n\ncould always be circumvented by suing named officials.\u2019552 In order to support what it \n\ncalled a \u2018pragmatic understanding\u2019, the ECtHR invoked an argument that was also \n\nemployed in the judgment of the House of Lords, namely that the UNCJISP established in \n\nArticle 2.1.b.iv that, for the purposes of the Convention, the word \u2018state\u2019 should be \n\nunderstood as comprising \u2018representatives of the State acting in that capacity\u2019.553  \n\nThe ECtHR also examined the practice of domestic (England, Canada, Australia, \n\nNew Zealand, the United States) and international courts (the ICJ and the ICTY) on the \n\nmatter. From its survey, the ECtHR concluded that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [t]he weight of authority at international and national level therefore appears to support the \n\nproposition that State immunity in principle offers individual employees or officers of a \n\nforeign State protection in respect of acts undertaken on behalf of the State under the same \n\ncloak as protects the State itself.\u2019554  \n\n \n\nThe ECtHR was then left with the question of whether there was an exception to \n\nthis rule in respect of acts of torture. As with the discussion about this issue which took \n\nplace in the House of Lords, one of the crucial points was whether torture could be \n\nconsidered an \u2018official act\u2019 for the purpose of immunity ratione materiae. The ECtHR first \n\nconsidered the definition of torture enshrined in Article 1 of the CAT, according to which \n\ntorture is an act \u2018inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of \n\n                                                \n551 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [202].

Lord \n\nBingham, in particular, pointed out that the only case-law relied upon by the applicants to \n\nsupport this argument, which came from the United States, did not express principles widely \n\nshared and observed among other nations \u2026\u2019556 \n\n \n\nSubsequently, the ECtHR discussed the DARSIWA and the relationship between \n\nstate responsibility and state immunity.557 Indeed, Articles 4 and 5 of the DARSIWA \n\nattribute to the state acts which were performed by state organs (as defined in Article 4) \n\nand persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority (Article 5).558 Article \n\n7 establishes that \u2018[t]he conduct of an organ of a State or of a person or entity empowered \n\nto exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State \n\nunder international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds \n\nits authority or contravenes instructions.\u2019559 Article 58, on its turn, makes clear that \u2018[t]hese \n\narticles are without prejudice to any question of the individual responsibility under \n\ninternational law of any person acting on behalf of a State.\u2019560 Thus, although the ECtHR \n\nhad stated that, in principle, state officials have immunity ratione materiae in respect of \n\nacts undertaken on behalf of the state, it conceded that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 individuals may in certain circumstances also be personally liable for wrongful acts which \n\nengage the State\u2019s responsibility, and that this personal liability exists alongside the State\u2019s \n\nliability for the same acts \u2026 This potential dual liability \u2026 is clearly seen in the criminal \n\n                                                \n555 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (adopted \n10 December 1984, entered into force 26 June 1987) 1465 UNTS 85. \n556 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [206]. \n557 ILC, \u2018Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries\u2019 \n(2001)&lt;legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf> accessed 20 November \n2015. \n558 ibid. \n559 ibid. \n560 ibid. \n\n\n\n168  \n\ncontext, where individual criminal liability for acts of torture exists alongside State \n\nresponsibility. \u2026 Thus, as the existence of individual criminal liability shows, even if the \n\nofficial nature of the acts is accepted for the purposes of State responsibility, this of itself is not \n\nconclusive as to whether, under international law, a claim for State immunity is always to be \n\nrecognised in respect of the same acts.\u2019561  \n\n \n\nIt seems that the ECtHR identified a difference between criminal and civil \n\nproceedings regarding the availability of immunity ratione materiae for state officials. As \n\nremarked by William Dodge,  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the ECtHR looks to the possibility of individual responsibility under criminal law to satisfy \n\nArticle 58 [of the DARSIWA] \u2026 Indeed, throughout its decision, the ECtHR repeatedly \n\ndistinguishes the substantial authority against treating human rights violations as official acts \n\non the ground that those cases involved criminal proceedings.\u2019562  \n\n \n\nThe ECtHR considered that it was \u2018far from settled\u2019 whether Article 14 of the CAT \n\nhad given rise to universal civil jurisdiction in respect of acts of torture.563 Although the \n\nCommittee Against Torture in General Comment No 3 stated the view that Article 14 \n\n\u2018requires all States Parties to ensure that all victims of torture and ill-treatment are able to \n\naccess remedy and obtain redress\u2019564, the ECtHR pointed out that the United States had \n\nmade a declaration to the CAT in which it expressed the understanding that Article 14 \n\nrequired a State Party to provide a civil remedy only in respect of acts of torture committed \n\nin a territory under the jurisdiction of that State Party.565 The ECtHR then added that the \n\njudicial practice in Canada (the Ontario Court of Appeal in Bouzari v Islamic Republic of \n\nIran) and in the United Kingdom (the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in the Jones \n\n                                                \n561 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [207]. \n562 Dodge (n 551). Dodge criticized this perspective: \n \n\n\u2018I find it hard to maintain a civil/criminal distinction with respect to immunity under customary \ninternational law, given the diversity of forms in which jurisdiction is exercised around the \nglobe, with many nations allowing private parties to initiate criminal proceedings (subject to \nvarying degrees of government control) and to seek damages in such suits. But even if one \nlooks only at state practice in civil cases, there is clearly no general and consistent practice of \nStates treating human rights violations as \u201cofficial acts.\u201d\u2019 \n\n \n563 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [208]. \n564 UN Committee Against Torture, \u2018General Comment No 3\u2019 (13 December 2012) CAT/C/GC/3, [22]. \n565 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [208]; Declarations and Reservations to the Convention \nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \n<https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en> accessed \n26 November 2015. \n\n\n\n169  \n\ncase) also shared the understanding that Article 14 was not meant to give rise to universal \n\ncivil jurisdiction.566  \n\nNonetheless, in the context of immunity ratione materiae of state officials, the \n\nECtHR identified \u2018some movement towards the establishment of an exception to State \n\nimmunity [for acts of torture].\u2019 567 Indeed, upon ratification of the UNCJISP, Norway, \n\nSweden and Switzerland declared that \u2018\u2026 the Convention is without prejudice to any \n\nfuture international development in the protection of human rights\u2019.568 Also, a Resolution \n\nof the IDI concluded in Naples in 2009 (\u2018Resolution on the Immunity from Jurisdiction of \n\nthe State and of Persons Who Act on Behalf of the State in case of International Crimes\u2019) \n\nprovided in Article III that \u2018[n]o immunity from jurisdiction other than personal immunity \n\nin accordance with international law applies with regard to international crime\u2019, having \n\npreviously established in Article I that \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 for the purposes of the Resolution \n\nencompassed both civil and criminal jurisdiction569. Furthermore, in a dictum of the \n\nFurundzija case, also mentioned by the Italian Court of Cassation in the Ferrini case, the \n\nICTY, in the context of discussing the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture, \n\ndeclared that \u2018the victim [of an act of torture] could bring a civil suit for damage in a \n\nforeign court, which would therefore be asked inter alia to disregard the legal value of the \n\nnational authorising act\u2019. 570 The separate opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans and \n\nBuergenthal in the ICJ\u2019s Arrest Warrant case also remarked that \u2018[i]t is now increasingly \n\nclaimed in the literature ... that serious international crimes cannot be regarded as official \n\nacts because they are neither normal State functions nor functions that a State alone (in \n\ncontrast to an individual) can perform\u2019571\u2014although Lords Bingham and Hoffmann in \n\nJones contended otherwise.  \n\nIn the light of all these elements, the ECtHR found \u2018there was acknowledged not to \n\nbe any consensus yet\u2019 in respect of the establishment of an exception to the immunity of \n\nstate officials for acts of torture.572 \n\n                                                \n566 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [208]. \n567 ibid [209]. \n568 Declarations and Reservations to the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States \nand Their Property&lt;https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=III-\n13&amp;chapter=3&amp;lang=en> accessed 26 November 2015. \n569 Institut de Droit International, Napoli Session \u2018Resolution on the Immunity from Jurisdiction of the State \nand of Persons Who Act on Behalf of the State in case of International Crimes\u2019 (2009) Third Commission \n(Rapporteur: Lady Fox). \n570 Prosecutor v Anto Furundzija (Judgment) ICTY-95-17/1-T (10 December 1998), [155]. \n571 Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Belgium) (Joint Separate Opinion \nof Judges Higgins, Kooijmans, and Buergenthal) [2002] ICJ Rep 3, [85]. \n572 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [209]. \n\n\n\n170  \n\nThe ECtHR then turned to civil claims brought before domestic courts dealing with \n\nthe question of whether there was a jus cogens exception in respect of the immunity \n\nratione materiae of state officials. The survey of domestic case-law (Canada, Australia, \n\nNew Zealand, the United States) undertook by the ECtHR showed that, as regards civil \n\nproceedings, only in the US there was judicial practice supporting the contention that \n\nviolations of jus cogens could not be considered official acts for the purpose of immunity \n\nratione materiae of state officials.573 It was concluded that there was no \u2018sufficient reason \n\n\u2026 to find that the grant of immunity in the [Jones] case did not reflect generally \n\nrecognised rules of public international law.\u2019574 Although the ECtHR conceded the law on \n\nthe matter was still evolving, it found no fault in the judgment of the House of Lords\u2014\n\nquite to the contrary, the ECtHR commended it: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [W]hile there is in the Court\u2019s view some emerging support in favour of a special rule or \n\nexception in public international law in cases concerning civil claims for torture lodged against \n\nforeign State officials, the bulk of the authority is \u2026 to the effect that the State\u2019s right to \n\nimmunity may not be circumvented by suing its servants or agents instead. Taking the \n\napplicants\u2019 arguments at their strongest, there is evidence of recent debate surrounding the \n\nunderstanding of the definition of torture in the Convention against Torture; the interaction \n\nbetween State immunity and the rules on attribution in the Draft Articles on State \n\nResponsibility; and the scope of Article 14 of the Convention against Torture \u2026 However, \n\nState practice on the question is in a state of flux, with evidence of both the grant and the \n\nrefusal of immunity ratione materiae in such cases. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [T]he House of Lords fully engaged with all of the relevant arguments concerning the \n\nexistence, in relation to civil claims of infliction of torture, of a possible exception to the \n\ngeneral rule of State immunity \u2026  In a lengthy and comprehensive judgment \u2026 it concluded \n\nthat customary international law did not admit of any exception\u2014regarding allegations of \n\nconduct amounting to torture\u2014to the general rule of immunity ratione materiae for State \n\nofficials in the sphere of civil claims where immunity is enjoyed by the State itself. The \n\nfindings of the House of Lords were neither manifestly erroneous nor arbitrary but were based \n\non extensive references to international law materials and consideration of the applicant\u2019s legal \n\n                                                \n573 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [210]-[211]. There are many difficulties surrounding judicial \npractice on this topic. The ECtHR mentioned there was \u2018little national case-law\u2019 in respect of civil claims \nagainst state officials for the violation of jus cogens. In respect of criminal cases, the survey of the ECtHR \nshowed (\u00a7212) \u2018some support \u2026 for the argument that torture cannot be committed in an \u201cofficial capacity\u201d \n\u2026\u2019. Also, some domestic legislations allow victims to attach a civil claim to criminal proceedings and, \nconsequently, as mentioned by the ECtHR (\u00a7212), \u2018\u2026 any difference in the approach to immunity ratione \nmateriae between civil and criminal cases will have an impact on the degree to which civil compensation is \navailable in the different States.\u2019  \n574 ibid [212]. \n\n\n\n171  \n\narguments and the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which had found in the applicants\u2019 \n\nfavour.\u2019575 \n\n \n\nThe ECtHR ultimately found that the grant of immunity ratione materiae to the \n\nindividual defendants by the English courts reflected generally recognized rules of \n\ninternational law and did not violate Article 6.1 of the ECHR.576 \n\n \n\n3.5.1.1 The dissenting opinion of Judge Kalaydjieva appended to the judgment of the \n\nECtHR in Jones v United Kingdom (2014) \n\n \n\nOn the point of whether there had been a violation of Article 6.1 in respect of Mr \n\nJones\u2019s claim against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Judge Kalaydjieva remarked that he \n\n\u2018[shared] the doubts\u2019 of some of the dissenting judges in Al-Adsani. Judge Kalaydjieva \n\nalso pointed out an incoherence in the law of state immunity that is often highlighted by \n\ncommentators: the ECtHR \u2018\u2026 had no difficulties in waiving the automatic application of \n\nState immunity and finding violations of the right of access to court concerning disputes \n\nover employment \u2026 but not concerning redress for torture.\u2019577  \n\nRegarding the applicants\u2019 claims that there had been a violation of Article 6.1 due \n\nto the grant of immunity to the state officials, Judge Kalaydjieva recalled some of the \n\narguments employed by Lord Justice Mance in the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Jones. \n\nHe pointed out he found it difficult to accept the distinction between criminal and civil law \n\njustified the grant of immunity in respect of the latter only.578 He added he did not find \n\ncompelling the argument civil proceedings against an alleged torturer involved a greater \n\ninterference in the internal affairs of a foreign state than criminal proceedings.579 He also \n\nmentioned there would be an incongruity if an alleged torturer could be prosecuted under \n\nArticle 5.2 of the CAT and at the same time could rely on immunity in respect of a civil \n\nclaim pursued by the victim. 580  Finally, Judge Kalaydjieva criticized the ECtHR\u2019s \n\nperspective on the matter, which aligned the immunity of the state itself with the immunity \n\nratione materiae of state officials: \n\n                                                \n575 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [213]-[214] (emphasis added). \n576 ibid [215]. \n577  Jones and others v United Kingdom (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Kalaydjieva) (2014) \n<http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-140005> accessed 26 November 2015. \n578 ibid. \n579 ibid. \n580 ibid. \n\n\n\n172  \n\n \n\u2018I find myself unable to agree with the findings of the majority that \u201csince an act cannot be \n\ncarried out by a State itself but only by individuals acting on the State\u2019s behalf, where \n\nimmunity can be invoked by the State then the starting point must be that immunity ratione \n\nmateriae applies to the acts of [torture committed by] State officials\u201d \u2026 This appears to \n\nsuggest that torture is by definition an act exercised on behalf of the State. That is a far cry \n\nfrom all international standards, which not only analyse it as a personal act, but require the \n\nStates to identify and punish the individual perpetrators of torture\u2013\u2013contrary to the \u201cpragmatic \n\nunderstanding\u201d of the majority that \u201c[i]f it were otherwise, State immunity could always be \n\ncircumvented by suing named officials\u201d. I fear that the views expressed by the majority on a \n\nquestion examined by this Court for the first time not only extend State immunity to named \n\nofficials without proper distinction or justification, but give the impression of also being \n\ncapable of extending impunity for acts of torture globally.\u2019581 \n\n \n\n Judge Kalaydjieva did not miss the opportunity and remembered the words of \n\nJudge Ferrari Bravo in his dissenting opinion appended to Al-Adsani: \n\n \n\u2018To use the words of one of the dissenting judges in Al-Adsani: \u201cWhat a pity!\u201d\u2019582 \n\n \n\n3.6 Concluding remarks \n\n \n\nThe trickle did not turn to a flood. The mainstream, hegemonic approach in respect \n\nof the law of state immunity prevailed in spite of being strongly contested by alternative \n\nviews. Before the delivery of the ICJ\u2019s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, \n\nRoger O\u2019Keefe remarked the following: \n\n \n\u2018The final nail in the coffin of attempts to circumvent state immunity in domestic civil \n\nproceedings for death or personal injury alleged to be caused by the defendant state in breach \n\nof some norm, perhaps peremptory, of international law relative to the humane treatment of \n\nindividuals may well prove to be the case of Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, brought by \n\nGermany against Italy in the ICJ and currently in progress.  \n\n\u2018\u2026[I]t is extremely hard to picture a majority of the [ICJ] backing\u2014in the absence of \n\nconsistent and representative state practice and opinio juris (not to mention logically cogent \n\narguments) in support of the proposition, and given the potential of such a decision to lead to \n\nantagonism between states\u2014a customary international rule to the effect that state immunity is \n\n                                                \n581 Jones and others v United Kingdom (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Kalaydjieva) (n 577). \n582 ibid. \n\n\n\n173  \n\nunavailable as a bar to domestic civil proceedings alleging the violation by the defendant \n\nforeign state of rules, even those of a peremptory character, of international law. And were the \n\nICJ, as is not unlikely, to come down categorically against such a rule, even if only in terms of \n\ncustomary international law \u201cas it presently stands\u201d and subject to an impassioned dissent by \n\nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade, the chances that future national courts (or legislatures) would reopen \n\nthe matter are close to zero.\u2019583 \n\n  \n\nIndeed, the ICJ, through its quantitative approach to the ascertainment of \n\ncustomary international law and resorting to formalist arguments like the distinction \n\nbetween procedural and substantive rules, may have crystallized a consensus according to \n\nwhich state immunity prevails over individual rights. This consensus came about through \n\nwhat Roger O\u2019Keefe called a \u2018customary international legal feedback loop\u2019. As put by \n\nhim: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 Al-Adsani and Kalogeropoulou have given rise to a customary international legal feedback \n\nloop. The ECtHR holds that states do not currently accept that state immunity is unavailable as \n\na bar to domestic proceedings for damages in respect of death or personal injury allegedly \n\ncaused by an international wrong at the hands of the defendant state. As a result, the courts of \n\nnearly all of the member states of the Council of Europe dismiss legal arguments in favor of \n\nthe unavailability of state immunity in such cases. In turn, it stands to reason that the ECtHR, \n\nand indeed other relevant international jurisdictions, will hold in future that states do not accept \n\nthat state immunity is unavailable as a bar to domestic proceedings for damages in respect of \n\ndeath or personal injury allegedly caused by an international wrong at the hands of the \n\ndefendant state. And so on in saecula saeculorum.  \n\n\u2018In addition, we are already seeing the courts of states outside the Council of Europe, when \n\nsimilarly faced with the submission that international law does not require the grant of state \n\nimmunity in civil claims for torture, looking for guidance to the decisions of the ECtHR in Al-\n\nAdsani and Kalogeropoulou or to subsequent decisions of the courts of states parties to the \n\nECHR in analogous cases\u2014especially, in the common law world, to the influential conclusion \n\nof the House of Lords in Jones.\u2019584  \n \n\nThe scope of the ICJ\u2019s ruling was very strict as regards the tort exception (in \n\nessence, the ICJ considered the tort exception inapplicable in respect of acts committed by \n\narmed forces in the course of an armed conflict in the territory of the forum state), but it \n\nmay be subject to more expansive readings in the future. Also, the argument according to \n                                                \n583 Roger O\u2019Keefe, \u2018State Immunity and Human Rights: Heads and Walls, Hearts and Minds\u2019 (2011) 44 \nVandJTL 999, 1032-1033. \n584 ibid 1017. \n\n\n\n174  \n\nwhich jus cogens may override state immunity is unlikely to succeed in the future. In \n\nJones, as seen previously, the ECtHR employed the ICJ\u2019s pronouncement in respect of the \n\nrelationship between state immunity and jus cogens to support its reasoning. It is worth \n\nremembering that eight out the seventeen judges of the Grand Chamber dissented of the \n\njudgment rendered in the Al-Adsani case. The Jones case was decided by a chamber of the \n\nECtHR. Out of the six judges, only one dissented and put forth that the approach adopted \n\nin Al-Adsani should have been reconsidered. This is an indication that the current \n\nprofessional consensus does not favor further restrictions to state immunity. \n\nAs mentioned before, the Italian Court of Cassation, in Judgment No 238/2014, \n\nrebelled against the ruling of the ICJ, but, as asserted by Fontanelli, \u2018it is clear that Italy \n\nhas gone down a spiral of isolation from the rest of the international community.\u2019585 \n\nThe antiquity and persistence of the law of state immunity may indeed explain \n\npartially its \u2018pull to compliance\u2019586. State immunity is, after all, widely understood as an \n\nexpression of defining characteristics of the international legal system.  \n\n                                                \n585 Fontanelli (n 517).  \n586 Thomas Franck, Fairness in International Law and Institutions (OUP 1998) 37. \n\n\n\n175  \n\n4 \u2014 PROPOSALS BY SCHOLARS \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this chapter, I expose and analyze the critiques of attempts to better reconcile \n\nstate immunity and human rights and the proposals to accomplish it put forth by two \n\nscholars, namely Lee Caplan and J\u00fcrgen Br\u00f6hmer. The chapter concludes by briefly \n\nassessing them. \n\n \n\n4.1 Lee Caplan \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Critiques of other attempts to reconcile state immunity and human rights \n\n \n\nIn Caplan\u2019s view, the normative hierarchy theory is flawed in its foundations. As \n\nmentioned previously in this monograph, the normative hierarchy theory, perceiving the \n\nexistence of a conflict between state immunity and jus cogens, asserts that jus cogens \n\nnorms, due to their higher rank, must be given precedence. According to Caplan, \u2018the \n\nnorms that are purportedly at odds with one another under the normative hierarchy theory \n\nin reality never clash\u2019.1 As seen in the first chapter of this monograph, Caplan is one of the \n\nauthors who contend that state immunity does not arise from the principle of sovereign \n\nequality and the maxim derived from it\u2014par in parem non habet imperium.2 According to \n\nCaplan, the principle of sovereign equality ought to be read as meaning an \u2018equal capacity \n\nfor rights\u2019.3 In his view, from this understanding, it follows that  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [t]his [equal] capacity diminishes when a state intrudes on another state\u2019s sphere of \n\nauthority, and becomes virtually dormant within another state\u2019s territorial borders. There is \n\nthus no inherent right of state immunity, as, ironically, is often suggested in the writings in \n\nsupport of the normative hierarchy approach.\u20194 \n\n                                                \n1 Lee M. Caplan, \u2018State Immunity, Human Rights, and Jus Cogens: A Critique of the Normative Hierarchy \nTheory\u2019 (2003) 97(4) AJIL 741, 771. \n2 ibid. \n3 ibid. \n4 ibid. \n\n\n\n176  \n\n \n\nAccording to Caplan, the binding norms created by the practice of waiving \n\nadjudicatory jurisdiction (ie, norms relating to state immunity) do not comprehend \u2018state \n\nconduct \u2026 that undermines the aim and purpose of the international legal order.\u20195 This is \n\nwhy he says that the normative hierarchy theory implies that the scope of state immunity is \n\nlarger than what is required by the international legal order.  \n\nThe real conflict, according to Caplan, does not occur between state immunity and \n\njus cogens, but between jus cogens and the state\u2019s right of adjudicatory jurisdiction, since, \n\nin his perspective, the grant of immunity in cases of violations of human rights is the result \n\nof the exercise by the forum state of its authority to regulate access to its courts.6 Lady \n\nHazel Fox, in her treatise on the law of state immunity, famously stated that  \n\n \n \u2018State immunity is a procedural rule going to the jurisdiction of a national court. It does not go \n\nto substantive law; it does not contradict a prohibition contained in a jus cogens norm but \n\nmerely diverts any breach of it to a different method of settlement. Arguably then, there is no \n\nsubstantive content in the procedural plea of State immunity upon which a jus cogens mandate \n\ncan bite.\u20197 \n\n \n\nSupported by this quotation, Caplan adds another criticism to the normative \n\nhierarchy theory:  \n\n \n\u2018To demonstrate a clash of international law norms, the normative hierarchy theory must prove \n\nthe existence of a jus cogens norm that prohibits the granting of immunity for violations of \n\nhuman rights by foreign states. However, the normative hierarchy theory provides no evidence \n\nof such a peremptory norm.\u20198 \n\n \n\nCaplan also makes the point that the difficulties surrounding the application of jus \n\ncogens norms undermine the normative hierarchy theory. As is known, although there is a \n\npositive concept of jus cogens, there is a not a consensus in respect of the content and the \n\nscope of the body of jus cogens beyond a few norms (eg, prohibitions against torture, \n\nslavery, aggression, genocide).9 Since, pursuant to the normative hierarchy theory, all jus \n\n                                                \n5 Caplan (n 1) 771. \n6 ibid. \n7 Hazel Fox, The Law of State Immunity (OUP 2002) 525. \n8 Caplan (n 1) 772. \n9 ibid. \n\n\n\n177  \n\ncogens norms can potentially pierce the veil of state immunity, courts might found \n\nthemselves in an odd situation. As explained by Caplan:  \n\n  \n\u2018Requiring application of the theory beyond cases of genocide, slavery, and torture would \n\nplace national courts in an awkward position. The [normative hierarchy] theory not only would \n\ndeprive the forum state of its right to regulate access to its own courts, but also would force \n\nthem to determine whether a particular norm of international law had attained the status of jus \n\ncogens, a task that international legal scholars have grappled with for decades with only \n\nlimited success. Further, the normative hierarchy theory logically requires courts to treat all \n\nviolations of peremptory norms uniformly, even violations of norms that do not implicate \n\nhuman rights but are arguably jus cogens, such as pacta sunt servanda. In addition, allowing \n\nthe courts to determine the parameters of jus cogens through application of the normative \n\nhierarchy theory may undermine the principle of separation of powers, in some cases \n\ninappropriately transferring foreign-policymaking power from the political branches of \n\ngovernment to the judiciary. Finally \u2026 [the] adoption of the normative hierarchy theory could \n\nbe the first step on a slippery slope that begins with state immunity from jurisdiction but could \n\nquickly extend to state immunity from execution against sovereign property and ultimately \n\nthreaten the \u201corderly international co-operation\u201d between states.\u201910 \n\n \n\nAnother argument advanced by Caplan is that, if one considers the principle of \n\nstate jurisdiction as belonging to the body of jus cogens, then there would be difficulties in \n\nsituations in which it clashes with jus cogens norms relating to the protection of human \n\nrights. Caplan questions:  \n\n \n\u2018Can there be a hierarchy of norms within the body of peremptory norms and, if so, which \n\nranks higher, human rights or territorial jurisdiction? The answers to these questions, if any, lie \n\ndeep in uncharted territory of international legal scholarship \u2026 The very fact that the \n\nnormative hierarchy theory would appear to lead courts into such a theoretical abyss casts \n\ndoubt on its practical viability and utility.\u201911  \n\n  \n\nCaplan also critiques two explanations linked to the normative hierarchy theory of \n\nhow a state may lose its entitlement to immunity. The first explanation is the implied \n\nwaiver theory, according to which a state, by violating a jus cogens norm, implicitly \n\nrenounces its right to immunity. The second explanation is that according to which \n\n                                                \n10 Caplan (n 1) 773 (footnotes omitted). \n11 ibid 774.  \n\n\n\n178  \n\nviolations of jus cogens are not within the scope of acts jure imperii, thus being outside the \n\nrealm of acts protected by immunity.  \n\nSince, in Caplan\u2019s view, the principle of adjudicatory jurisdiction is the starting \n\npoint of analysis and there is no entitlement to state immunity in respect of human rights \n\nviolations in international law, he concludes the \u2018implied waiver\u2019 theory is not compelling. \n\nIn his words: \n\n \n\u2018[A] foreign state\u2019s entitlement to immunity for human rights violations is not derived from \n\ninternational law, so a foreign state cannot lose its right to immunity by violating international \n\nlaw.\u201912 \n\n \n\nThe second explanation is also not compelling to him: \n\n \n\u2018[A] foreign state does not cease to be a sovereign state simply because it commits acts of a \n\ncriminal nature, including violations of human rights norms. Moreover, if state conduct that \n\nviolates jus cogens is assertedly not jure imperii and obviously not jure gestionis (private or \n\ncommercial), then what is it? This question is not addressed by supporters of the normative \n\nhierarchy theory. The real answer lies in the fact that foreign states are entitled to immunity for \n\nhuman rights violations only to the extent that a forum state grants them that privilege.\u201913  \n\n \n\n It thus can be said that Lee Caplan rejects the normative hierarchy theory in all its \n\nfacets. \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Proposal  \n\n \n\nBeing a critic of the normative hierarchy theory and dismissing the soundness of \n\nthe approach to state immunity according to which the starting point is the principle of \n\nsovereign equality, Caplan proposes an alternative perspective, labeled by him as the \n\n\u2018theory of state collective benefit\u2019. It is a proposal de lege lata, insofar as Caplan believes \n\nthere is a misunderstanding concerning the basis of state immunity. One of the foundations \n\nof his approach is Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s judgment in the Schooner Exchange case. As \n\ndiscussed before, in this case Marshall considered that  \n\n \n\n                                                \n12 Caplan (n 1) 775. \n13 ibid (footnotes omitted). \n\n\n\n179  \n\n\u2018\u2026 [the] common interest impelling [sovereigns] to mutual intercourse, and an interchange of \n\ngood offices with each other, have given rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is \n\nunderstood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction \n\nwhich has been stated to be the attribute of every nation.\u201914 \n\n \n\nCaplan conceives state immunity \u2018\u2026 as arising out of an agreement forged between \n\nthe forum state and any foreign state with which it seeks to develop transnational \n\nintercourse.\u201915 The crystallization of this practice into customary international law would \n\nthus determine the scope of the international rule of state immunity, which is founded, as \n\nremarked by Chief Justice Marshall, on the common interest of states. According to \n\nCaplan, the ICJ adopted this functional approach to state immunity in the Arrest Warrant \n\ncase when it considered that \u2018\u2026 in customary international law, the immunities accorded \n\nto Ministers for Foreign Affairs are not granted for their personal benefit, but to ensure the \n\neffective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective States.\u2019 16 It is \n\ndoubtful whether the ICJ departed from the approach according to which state immunity \n\nderives from the principle of sovereign equality of state. In Jurisdictional Immunities of the \n\nState, a judgment delivered about a decade later, the ICJ stated that \u2018the rule of State \n\nimmunity \u2026 derives from the principle of sovereign equality of States\u2019.17  In any case, \n\nCaplan laid out his alternative approach to state immunity in the following way:  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 the sole raison d\u2019\u00eatre for state immunity under customary international law is so that states \n\ncan perform their public functions effectively and ensure that international relations are \n\nconducted in an orderly fashion.  \n\n\u2018If one accepts this basic premise, then conduct of a foreign state that does not conform with \n\nthe development of beneficial interstate relations falls outside the state immunity \u201cagreement\u201d \n\nand thus is not immune by virtue of international custom. The most obvious example excludes \n\nforeign state conduct that does significant harm to the vital interests of the forum state, such as \n\nthe commission of human rights abuses against the forum state\u2019s nationals. Accordingly, the \n\nbasic test for distinguishing between immune and nonimmune transactions should not be \n\n                                                \n14 The Schooner Exchange v McFaddon (1812) 11 US (7 Cranch) 116 (Supreme Court of the United States) \n<https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/11/116/case.html> accessed 26 November 2015, 137. \n15 Caplan (n 1) 777. \n16 Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

Nevertheless, Caplan \n\nlays down two limitations to this approach. The first one relates to the consistency of the \n\nforum state\u2019s immunity policy with the international rules of adjudicatory jurisdiction\u2014in \n\nhis words, \u2018\u2026 when opening up domestic courts to human rights litigation, it is necessary \n\nto ensure maintenance of an appropriate connection between the dispute and the forum \n\nstate under international law.\u2019 19  The second one relates to the consistency with \n\ninternational law in general. As put by him, \u2018\u2026 any alteration in state immunity law that \n\nunjustifiably endangers peaceful relations may be unlawful.\u201920 \n\nFinally, Caplan gives two examples in international practice consistent with his \n\n\u2018theory of collective state benefit\u2019.  \n\nThe first one is the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 1996, which \n\namended the FSIA 1976. As previously discussed, this Amendment removes immunity in \n\ncases in which \u2018\u2026 money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or \n\ndeath that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage \n\ntaking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act\u2026\u2019.21 This removal \n\nof immunity is applicable only in respect of states designated by the United States as \n\n\u2018sponsors of terrorism\u2019. Also, as specified by the Act, the claimant or the victim must be a \n\n\u2018national of the United States\u2019, \u2018a member of the armed forces\u2019 or \u2018otherwise an employee \n\nof the Government of the United States, or of an individual performing a contract awarded \n\nby the United States Government, acting within the scope of the employee\u2019s employment\u2019. \n\nThe second example given by Caplan is the judgment of the Greek Court of \n\nCassation in the Distomo Massacre case. As previously discussed, in this judgment, the \n\nAreios Pagos mentioned the emergence in international law of an exception to state \n\nimmunity in respect of torts committed in the state of the forum, but remarked that this \n\nexception did not apply in situations of armed conflict. However, in the case, Germany had \n\nperpetrated crimes against people unconnected with the military operations, which led the \n\n                                                \n18 Caplan (n 1) 777. \n19 ibid 778. \n20 ibid. \n21 US Code, Section 1605A&lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605A> accessed 26 November \n2015. \n\n\n\n181  \n\nCourt to hold that the tort exception to state immunity was applicable\u2014furthermore, as \n\nargued by the Greek Court of Cassation, those acts had been committed in abuse of \n\nsovereign power. Caplan commended the reasoning adopted in the judgment of the Areios \n\nPagos, except in respect of its endorsement of the normative hierarchy theory. Caplan \n\nconcluded that both examples \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 demonstrate that progress can be made in resolving the human rights litigation problem in \n\na manner consistent with the true nature of the doctrine of foreign state immunity. That is to \n\nsay that the forum state, through the agent it designates to create and interpret foreign state \n\nimmunity law (the U.S. Congress in the case of the 1996 amendment and the Hellenic Supreme \n\nCourt in the case of Prefecture of Voiotia [the Distomo Massacre case]), is empowered to \n\nmodify foreign state immunity law to an extent consistent with the theory of collective state \n\nbenefit.\u201922 \n\n \n\n4.2 J\u00fcrgen Br\u00f6hmer  \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Critiques of other attempts to reconcile state immunity and human rights  \n\n \n\nIn his book, which, to my knowledge, was the first one to deal comprehensively \n\nwith the relationship between state immunity and human rights, Br\u00f6hmer critically \n\nsurveyed four attempts to reconcile both. \n\nBr\u00f6hmer dismisses the implied waiver theory, according to which, by violating a \n\njus cogens norm, a state waives its right to immunity. He presented the following criticism: \n\n \n\u2018Waiver of immunity is just another term for consenting to submit to the jurisdiction of the \n\nforum. To construe consent where there is none does not make sense. \u2026 While it is unclear \n\nwhether a state is really entitled to immunity in cases of jus cogens violations, the intentions of \n\nthat state will certainly not be directed at giving up its claim to immunity. The opposite is true \n\nand that is precisely the reason for the controversy. If, however, the state\u2019s interest and \n\nintention is to avoid a lawsuit and possible liability, it is illogical to maintain that the same \n\nstate has waived the very right enabling to achieve that goal. To construe an implied waiver in \n\nthese cases is effectively the same as saying that here is no immunity in the first place for states \n\nwhich have violated the said norms of international law.\u201923 \n\n \n                                                \n22 Caplan (n 1) 780. \n23  J\u00fcrgen Br\u00f6hmer, State Immunity and the Violation of Human Rights (Martinus Nijhoff 1997) 191 \n(footnotes omitted). \n\n\n\n182  \n\nBr\u00f6hmer also highlights the inadequacies of restricting immunity as a \u2018reprisal\u2019. As \n\npointed out by Matthias Ruffert, the notion of \u2018reprisals\u2019 has largely been replaced by that \n\nof \u2018countermeasures\u2019\u2014something that is reflected in the DARSIWA 2001, which adopted \n\nthe latter notion. The term \u2018reprisals\u2019 is nowadays limited to the context of wartime \n\nmeasures.24 In any case, Br\u00f6hmer employed the term in a manner coincident with the \n\ncurrent usage of countermeasures, ie as \u2018\u2026 coercive measures adopted by one state against \n\nanother state, which would be illegal under international law, were it not aimed at the \n\nsettlement of a dispute brought about by the latter\u2019s illegal or unjustified conduct.\u201925 The \n\nILC\u2019s Commentaries to the DARSIWA state that countermeasures  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 may only be taken by an injured State in order to induce the responsible State to comply \n\nwith its obligations \u2026 to cease the internationally wrongful conduct, if it is continuing, and to \n\nprovide reparation to the injured State. Countermeasures are not intended as a form of \n\npunishment for wrongful conduct, but as an instrument for achieving compliance with the \n\nobligations of the responsible State [to cease the internationally wrongful conduct] \u2026\u201926 \n\n \n\nBr\u00f6hmer points outs several problems that may arise from the adoption of the \n\nnotion of reprisals in order to justify the restriction of state immunity in respect of \n\nviolations of human rights:  \n\n \n\u2018First and foremost, it would require that the denial of immunity is considered a violation of \n\ninternational law and only admissible because it is itself directed against such a violation. Even \n\nif one were to consider the denial of immunity in such cases as contrary to international law \u2026 \n\nthis notion could not be upheld. Within the framework of judicial proceedings it would \n\ninevitably lead into a circular argument because it will often be the object of the proceedings to \n\ndetermine whether international law has been breached. Should the court determine that this \n\nwas not the case, the forum state would itself have committed a violation of international law \n\nby allowing the proceedings in the first place. This would cause a great amount of legal \n\nuncertainty, without answering the principle underlying question of whether international law \n\ndemands immunity in such cases and if so why, respectively, why not. Other questions and \n\nproblems would arise in regard to the controversial nature of the concept of reprisal itself. \n\nWhat kind of link is necessary between the state using its court system as a reprisal and the \n\n                                                \n24 Matthias Ruffert, \u2018Reprisals\u2019 in R Wolfrum (ed), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law \n(OUP 2012). \n25 Br\u00f6hmer (n 23) 193 (footnotes omitted). \n26 ILC, \u2018Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries\u2019 \n(2001)&lt;legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf> accessed 26 November \n2015. \n\n\n\n183  \n\nviolation to be remedied by it (e.g. protection of nationals only?) and how do those links differ \n\nfrom those needed to establish jurisdiction stricto sensu?\u201927 \n\n \n\nA similar proposal to that of the implied waiver theory, the idea of forfeiture of \n\nimmunity as a consequence of the jus cogens and erga omnes character of the human rights \n\nnorms violated is also not accepted by Br\u00f6hmer, since \u2018\u2026 resorting to forfeiture would \n\nmean that all cases in which the violation of jus cogens norms of international human \n\nrights law is at issue would have to be treated the same\u2019 and he doubts whether that would \n\nbe an adequate solution.28 \n\nLastly, Br\u00f6hmer analyzes Mathias Reimann\u2019s proposal for an amendment of the \n\nFSIA to allow suits for human rights violations. Mathias Reimann considered two \n\nexplanations for the removal of immunity in respect of human rights violation: the first is \n\nthe argument according to which a violation of jus cogens could not be considered a \n\nsovereign act, thus not being entitled to immunity; the second, the argument according to \n\nwhich jus cogens norms are hierarchically superior to the norms relating to state immunity, \n\nand, as result, the former take precedence over the latter.29 Mathias Reimann takes the \n\nposition that these propositions may have troublesome consequences, insofar as they \n\nsuggest state immunity should always be denied in respect of jus cogens violations.30 \n\nReimann argues that the approaches which suggest \u2018\u2026 the forum may, or at most should \n\n(but not must) deny immunity for massive human rights violations\u2019 are more consistent \n\nwith \u2018the two major principles underlying the sovereign immunity rule, namely \n\nnoninterference with another state\u2019s internal affairs, and equality of sovereigns\u2019.31 In the \n\nlight of these considerations, he proposes \u2018\u2026 an individual country\u2019s courts should hear \n\nonly cases in which this country has a specific and legitimate concern.\u201932 In the context of \n\nthe FSIA, he expresses approval as regards piercing the veil of immunity in cases in which \n\nnationals of the forum state were victims of grave human rights violations.33 In any case, \n\nReimann recommends caution and advises that  \n\n \n\n                                                \n27 Br\u00f6hmer (n 23) 193 (footnotes omitted). \n28 ibid 194.  \n29 Mathias Reimann, \u2018A Human Rights Exception to Sovereign Immunity: Some Thoughts on Princz v. \nFederal Republic of Germany\u2019 (1995) 16 MichJIL 403, 421. \n30 ibid 421. \n31 ibid. \n32 ibid 422. \n33 ibid. \n\n\n\n184  \n\n\u2018\u2026 in order to enhance the international acceptability of results, courts in human cases against \n\nforeign sovereigns should tread lightly and err on the side of deference to the defendant state\u2019s \n\nlaw as long as such law is acceptable under international standards.\u201934 \n\n \n\nBr\u00f6hmer asserts that Reimann\u2019s proposal is, in fact, \u2018no restriction from the point \n\nof view of international law because such an exception could then be invoked by nationals \n\nof all countries in their respective domestic forums.\u201935 In his view, Reimann\u2019s proposal \n\ndoes not really reconcile human rights and state immunity because it does not confer \n\nproper regard to the sovereignty of the defendant state, thus defeating the purpose of \n\nimmunity rules.36 \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Proposal  \n\n \n\nIn order to formulate his proposal, Br\u00f6hmer sought to identify the rationale that \n\ngoverns the attribution of immunity and then to apply it to the situation of human rights \n\nviolations. In Br\u00f6hmer\u2019s assessment, state practice revealed two approaches in respect of \n\nthe grant of state immunity.37 The first one adopts the distinction between acta jure imperii \n\nand acta jure gestionis. The second one supports the understanding according to which the \n\nveil of immunity can be pierced even in respect of acta jure imperii if there is a sufficient \n\nterritorial link.  \n\nBr\u00f6hmer argues that these two mainstream approaches reveal that the distinction \n\nbetween immune and non-immune acts is based on three elements.38 He labels the first two \n\nelements \u2018option\u2019 and \u2018risk calculability\u2019. The third element is the pacifying function of \n\nimmunity.39 If these criteria justify the removal of immunity in some cases, it should be \n\nassessed whether they could also justify the removal of immunity in respect of human \n\nrights violations.  \n\nBr\u00f6hmer explains the \u2018option\u2019 element in the following way:  \n\n  \n\n                                                \n34 Reimann (n 29) 422 (footnotes omitted). \n35 Br\u00f6hmer (n 23) 196. \n36 ibid. \n37 ibid 197. \n38 ibid. \n39 ibid: \u2018Immunity as a reflection of a state\u2019s sovereignty is also aimed at avoiding conflicts between states. \nThe immunity privilege safeguards and preserves the international peace of justice.\u2019 \n\n\n\n185  \n\n\u2018The gestionis/imperii distinction is in principle based on the fictional assumption that by \n\nchoosing private means of pursuing an objective the state also willingly exposes itself to the \n\npotential liability risks and to private remedies available to the other party of the transaction.  \n\n\u2026 Under the broad restrictive approach, which denies immunity for government torts if a \n\nsufficient territorial link can be established, the right to exercise jurisdiction can be justified as \n\na consequence of the decision of the foreign state to act within (or with a sufficient connection \n\nto) the territory and the legal order of the forum state.\u201940 \n\n \n\nThe idea underlying the \u2018risk calculability\u2019 element is that  \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 foreign states should be able to foresee and calculate potential liability risks which might \n\narise as a result of their exposure to foreign jurisdiction and thus be put in a position to adapt \n\ntheir behavior accordingly. \u2026 [T]he higher the liability risk, the more difficult it will be to \n\nargue that the state really opted to accept that risk.\u201941  \n\n \n\nBr\u00f6hmer links both criteria to the concept of sovereignty. The \u2018option\u2019 element \n\nrelates to the sovereign equality of states and emphasizes consent, whilst the \u2018risk \n\ncalculability\u2019 element relates to the functional aspect of sovereignty and puts into the \n\nequation the fact that the ability of a state to perform its functions could be threatened if it \n\nhad to cover liability claims in a multitude of fora around the world.42  \n\nBr\u00f6hmer assesses that the \u2018option\u2019 element can also justify the removal of \n\nimmunity in cases of human rights violations. In the same way a state can choose whether \n\nor not to enter into a private transaction, a state can choose among alternatives in the \n\ndomain of human rights. The distinction is that, in the domain of human rights, the option \n\nis predetermined by international law. As put by Br\u00f6hmer: \n \n\n\u2018States must not violate fundamental human rights. The sovereignty of states does not include \n\nthe right to submit an individual to torture or to arbitrarily kill people \u2026 Nonetheless, the state \n\nfully retains the power to influence its fate: no violation, no liability.\u201943 \n\n \n\nAs regards the \u2018risk calculability element\u2019, Br\u00f6hmer points out that, in the context \n\nof commercial transactions, \u2018the economic interest of the state will in most cases prevent \n\nthe state from assuming unforeseeable and incalculable commercial risks\u2019.44 The situation \n\n                                                \n40 Br\u00f6hmer (n 23) 197-198. \n41 ibid 197. \n42 ibid 198. \n43 ibid 199. \n44 ibid 201. \n\n\n\n186  \n\nin respect of torts is different, insofar only negligent torts are insurable. Although \n\nintentional torts are not insurable, Br\u00f6hmer considers that, in this case, \u2018the impossibility \n\nof precisely pre-calculating the liability risk is compensated by the fact that the state has \n\nfull control of its conduct.\u201945 Furthermore, Br\u00f6hmer points out that the position of a state as \n\nregards an intentional tort can be even more favorable than as regards a commercial \n\ntransaction. As put by him: \n \n\n\u2018Whereas practical circumstances might force a state to enter into a high risk commercial \n\ntransaction, it is inconceivable that a state might be compelled to commit an intentional tort by \n\nway of violating human rights.\u201946  \n\n \n\nIn the light of these considerations, Br\u00f6hmer concludes the \u2018risk calculability\u2019 \n\nelement does not support the view that human rights violations should be protected by \n\nimmunity. The \u2018option\u2019 and the \u2018risk calculability\u2019 elements, in Br\u00f6hmer\u2019s analysis, justify \n\nprotecting states with the shield of immunity. There are situations in which, however, not \n\ngranting immunity to states in respect of human rights violations may not fulfill the third \n\ncriterion proposed by Br\u00f6hmer in order to differentiate between immune and non-immune \n\nconducts: the pacifying function of immunity. As argued by him:  \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 [H]uman rights can be violated in many different ways. Massive violations of the laws of \n\nwar, for example, could result in the death or injury of thousands, perhaps even millions of \n\nindividuals. If all these potential victims were to bring actions against the violating state, the \n\nstate would necessarily cease to function long before all these individuals could be \n\ncompensated. Even if one assumes that the violating state would try to comply with judgments \n\nrendered against it, compensation would reach only a few individuals on a \u201cfirst-come-first-\n\nserve\u201d basis. However, it is questionable whether any state could and would accept a regime \n\nwhich would render it defunct both internally and externally as a member of the international \n\ncommunity. Such a regime would undoubtedly jeopardise the international peace of justice \n\nwhile at the same time doing nothing for the individual victim. The war crimes committed by \n\nall sides during World War II, the Holocaust with its millions of victims, the conflict in former \n\nYugoslavia, to name just a few examples, cannot be dealt with before the district courts of the \n\nworld, notwithstanding the fact that all the suffering brought about by these violations of \n\ninternational law was ultimately individual suffering.\u201947  \n\n \n\n                                                \n45 Br\u00f6hmer (n 23) 201. \n46 ibid 202. \n47 ibid 204-205. \n\n\n\n187  \n\nHaving this in mind, Br\u00f6hmer proposes that immunity should be removed in \n\nrespect of violations of human rights \u2018carried out with the intention to inflict injury on \n\nspecific, isolated and pre-identified individuals\u2019 and preserved as regards violations of \n\nhuman rights \u2018\u2026 carried out indiscriminately, for example in an armed conflict\u201948. Whilst \n\nvery original, Br\u00f6hmer\u2019s proposal sounds indeed quite shocking. The rationale is that the \n\nliability risk associated with individualized violations of human rights will not threaten a \n\nstate\u2019s functional sovereignty. As explained by Br\u00f6hmer: \n \n\n\u2018War, war crimes and genocide per definitionem inflict pain on thousands, sometimes millions \n\nof individuals. Municipal courts are just not equipped to deal with the sheer number of cases \n\nwhich could arise from such crimes. It would be impossible for the responsible state to satisfy \n\nall the judgments rendered against it. Even an attempt to do so would cripple its ability to \n\nfunction as a state for an unpredictable period of time. The resulting inability to continue to \n\nfunction as a state, to preserve peace and to promote some kind of general welfare, would not \n\nonly constitute the ultimate infringement on that state\u2019s functional sovereignty it would also \n\nconstitute a threat to international peace because states would most likely not accept such \n\nsubordination.\u201949 \n\n \n\nBr\u00f6hmer admits there are borderline cases in which it is difficult to differentiate \n\nbetween individualized and indiscriminate violations of human rights. In these cases, \n\nBr\u00f6hme suggests a procedure analogous to that of filing bankruptcy:  \n \n\n\u2018The defendant state could be allowed to invoke the immunity defence if it can establish to the \n\nsatisfaction of the court that the exercise of jurisdiction in this particular case could prompt so \n\nmany other victims of human rights violations to also commence proceedings in the same or \n\nother national forums that the cumulative effect of a negative outcome of these cases would \n\nimperil its functional sovereignty. \n\n\u2018\u2026 The state\u2019s position could be improved further by applying the rule \u201cin dubio pro \n\nimmunitate\u201d in this respect. In borderline cases the defendant state\u2019s position could be \n\nadditionally improved if recourse to the immunity defence were allowed if the state proves to \n\nthe court that it has submitted the matter either to a respective international institution with \n\njurisdiction to review the allegations and provide the plaintiff with adequate compensation or \n\nto some other effective international dispute settlement mechanism.\u201950 \n\n \n\n                                                \n48 Br\u00f6hmer (n 23) 205.  \n49 ibid 206-207. \n50 ibid 212-213. \n\n\n\n188  \n\n In sum, Br\u00f6hmer\u2019s argument is that international law does not prohibit states from \n\nexercising jurisdiction over foreign states in cases in which victims of human rights \n\nviolations seek damages against the foreign state for injuries which could be characterized \n\nas torts under the law of the forum, even if these violations were committed jure imperii. \n\nBr\u00f6hmer, however, adds a limitation: immunity remains if the exercise of jurisdiction over \n\nthe matter in question could threaten the foreign state\u2019s functional sovereignty by allowing \n\na large number of similar claims, since that could interfere with the foreign state\u2019s capacity \n\nto discharge its public functions.51  \n \n\n4.3 Assessment and concluding remarks \n\n \n\n As seen in chapter 3, most judgments dealing with the relationship between state \n\nimmunity and human rights relied on an amorphous notion of sovereignty and on the \n\nmaxim par in parem non habet jurisdiction and lacked a more solid theoretical elaboration \n\nof the law of state immunity. The proposals put forth by Caplan and Br\u00f6hmer reveal that \n\nthe foundations of the principles and rules relating to state immunity are still a contentious \n\nissue. \n\n                                                \n51 Br\u00f6hmer (n 23) 214. Br\u00f6hmer formulated a provision codifying his proposal that could be included in an \ninternational treaty on the subject of state immunity in the following way:  \n \n\n\u2018A Foreign State shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the forum State to adjudicate \n\u2018A. If the case of action relates to death or personal injury and the act or omission, whether \ngovernmental in nature or not, which caused the death or injury also constitutes a violation of \nsuch fundamental international human rights, which are part of the jus cogens body of \ninternational law, eg the prohibition of torture and extrajudicial killing, and if  \n\u20181. the act or omission of the Foreign State which caused the death or personal injury was \naimed at the injured or killed individual and if  \n\u20182. the act or omission of the Foreign State which caused the death or personal injury is not in \nviolation of other norms of international law designed to protect large groups of individuals, eg \nthe prohibition of genocide and if \n\u20183. the act or omission of the Foreign State which caused the death or personal injury did not \noccur in the context of an armed conflict between states. \n\u2018B. In exceptional circumstances a Foreign State shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the \nforum State to adjudicate despite the applicability of section A.1 above \n\u20181. if the Foreign State presents a prima facie case that the exercise of jurisdiction in this matter \ncould lead to an unforeseeable number of similar claims in the forum state or other states \nwhich to settle individually could seriously interfere with the Foreign State\u2019s ability to \ndischarge its public functions or if  \n\u20182. the Foreign State establishes to the satisfaction of the tribunal that it has submitted the \nmatter either to a respective international institutional with jurisdiction to review the \nallegations and provide the plaintiff with adequate compensation or to some other effective \ninternational dispute settlement mechanism.\u2019 \n\n \n\n\n\n189  \n\nCaplan\u2019s attempt to reconcile state immunity and human rights sought to rescue a \n\nfoundational discourse on the rationale of state immunity enshrined in Chief Justice \n\nMarshall\u2019s judgment in Schooner Exchange, namely that state immunity has the function \n\nof ensuring the development of beneficial relations among states. In Caplan\u2019s view, it \n\nshould follow that conducts that do not conform to this purpose, such as human rights \n\nviolations, are not immune under international law. Caplan also emphasizes that the \n\ninternational rules on jurisdiction must be respected, ie there must be an appropriate \n\nconnection between the dispute and the forum state in accordance with international law.  \n\nBr\u00f6hmer took a different path. He tried to identify the elements that justify the \n\nremoval of immunity in the two mainstream approaches to the law of state immunity. As \n\nseen previously, the first one is based on the distinction between acta jure imperii and acta \n\njure gestionis and posits that immunity should be accorded only to the former. The second \n\nmodel posits that the veil of state immunity can be pierced even for acta jure imperii \n\nprovided the existence of a sufficient territorial link. In Br\u00f6hmer\u2019s view, the elements that \n\ngovern these two approaches can justify the removal of immunity in respect of human \n\nrights violations, subject to the limitation that the exercise of jurisdiction in these cases \n\ndoes not threaten the functional aspect of the foreign state\u2019s sovereignty. In Br\u00f6hmer\u2019s \n\nmodel, therefore, cases connected to indiscriminate violations of human rights would \n\nremain protected by state immunity.  \n\n Both authors highlighted the awkwardness of the solutions generally adopted to \n\njustify the removal of state immunity in human rights cases, such as the normative \n\nhierarchy theory and the implied waiver theory. \n\n Although both proposals are interesting, thus far they failed to gain general \n\nacceptance. As discussed in chapter 3, in Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia, the Italian \n\nCourt of Cassation adopted a functional approach to state immunity identical to the one \n\nproposed by Caplan, but it remained isolated.  \n\n\n\n190  \n\n5 \u2014 A CONFLICT OF CONCEPTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2018It is not for a national court to \u201cdevelop\u201d international law by unilaterally adopting a \n\nversion of that law which, however desirable, forward-looking and reflective of values it \n\nmay be, is simply not accepted by other states.\u2019 \n\n \n\nLord Hoffmann, Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and \n\nAnother (Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Another Intervening) [2007] 129  \n\nILR 713 (House of Lords), [63] \n\n \n\n\u2018\u2026 [Q]ueste Sezioni unite sono consapevoli di contribuire cos\u00ec alla emersione di una \n\nregola conformativa della immunit\u00e0 dello Stato estero, che si ritiene comunque gi\u00e0 insita \n\nnel sistema dell\u2019ordinamento internazionale\u2026\u2019 \n\n \n\nGermany v Mantelli and Others (Case No 14201/2008) (29 May 2008) ILDC 1037 (Italian \n\nCourt of Cassation), [11]  \n\n \n\n\u2018\u2026 [I]t was never the essential meanings of words that allowed us to do the good things we \n\nassociate with the rule of law. \u2026 If as a last resort you wish to argue that it is a good thing \n\nto maintain the myth of the neutral rule of law (while privately acknowledging its \n\nemptiness), I would remind you that those who rely for their defense on myths are always \n\nmisdirected and often disappointed.\u2019 \n\n \n\nJames Boyle, \u2018Ideals and Things: International Legal Scholarship and the Prison-House of \n\nLanguage\u2019 (1985) 26(2) HILJ 327, 351-352 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n191  \n\n \n\nThe relationship between state immunity and human rights has been one of the \n\nmost controversial and discussed subjects of international law. The decision rendered by \n\nthe ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State was said to have settled some key points \n\nof the debate. Finally there would be certainty in a debate relating to an area of law \n\ndistinguished by fragmentation. As Philippa Webb correctly indicated, the ICJ\u2019s \n\nJurisdictional Immunities of the State judgment can provide a \u2018point of integration\u2019 \n\nconcerning the law.1 Although it may be argued that it is a bad point of integration, the \n\nauthority usually attached to pronouncements of the ICJ has the effect of consolidating the \n\nlaw and limiting to a certain extent the scope of further discussions on the issues that were \n\nsettled.  \n\nOne could, therefore, conclude that the only logical thing for commentators and \n\ntheorists to do would be to update textbooks to include the inescapable conclusions drawn \n\nby the ICJ and to write articles commenting on and spreading the \u2018correct\u2019 legal \n\ninterpretation. Notwithstanding this line of thinking, I share Andrea Bianchi\u2019s belief that \n\n\u2018[t]here is nothing inherently correct or incorrect in a judicial determination such as this.\u20192  \n\nThis chapter argues that the technical and dogmatic normative discussions engaged \n\nin by the various courts which had to deal with issues relating to state immunity and \n\nhuman rights hide theoretical conflicts, which happen at a \u2018higher level of abstraction\u2019.3 \n\nWhat we have at hand is essentially a conflict among different conceptions of international \n\nlaw. There is nothing inherent about the hegemonic outcome privileging state immunity to \n\nthe detriment of human rights. This consensus, which may have crystallized with the ICJ\u2019s \n\nruling in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, is contingent and can be questioned.  \n\nIn the first part of this chapter, I shall present Koskenniemi\u2019s proposal to treat \n\ninternational law as a language and discuss how it relates to the problem of the \n\nindeterminacy of international law. Koskenniemi\u2019s argument highlights the contingency of \n\ncurrent preferred interpretative outcomes and the existence of structural biases.  \n\nIn the following section, I contend that the legal questions in respect of the \n\nrelationship between state immunity and human rights the various courts had to consider \n\ndo not have objectively ascertainable answers. As previously mentioned, the conflicting \n\n                                                \n1 Philippa Webb, International Judicial Integration and Fragmentation (OUP 2013) 92. \n2 Andrea Bianchi, \u2018On Certainty\u2019&lt;http://www.ejiltalk.org/on-certainty/> accessed 26 November 2015. \n3 This expression is borrowed from Koskenniemi. See Martti Koskenniemi, From Apology to Utopia: The \nStructure of International Legal Argument (CUP 2005) 3. \n\n\n\n192  \n\nanswers reproduce theoretical conflicts that happen at a \u2018higher level of abstraction\u2019. The \n\nhegemonic outcomes may, therefore, be questioned through the language of international \n\nlaw. In the case of the relationship between state immunity and human rights, it is \n\nconsidered that, although the ICJ may have crystallized a consensus according to which the \n\nformer prevails over the latter, many dissenting voices emerged and this position remains \n\nopen to contestation. It is also highlighted how the different theoretical approaches to \n\ninternational law resulted in different attitudes towards its ascertainment and towards the \n\nrole of the interpreter and of the institution in charge of applying the law. Subsequently, it \n\nis analyzed whether the judicial practice surveyed represented a victory for formalism in \n\nmatters regarding the relationship between state immunity and human rights.  \n\nProspects are considered in the next section. It is pondered whether there may still \n\nbe room for courts to reassess the relationship between state immunity and human rights. \n\nThe section then briefly examines the proposal for an optional protocol to the UNCJISP \n\nproviding for the abrogation of state immunity in civil claims based on violations of human \n\nrights. Also, it discusses the suggestion that focus should be shifted from the failure of the \n\nforum state\u2019s courts to provide a remedy for the victims of serious violations of human \n\nrights as a result of the grant of state immunity to the state which caused death or personal \n\ninjury in breach of international law and to the state which failed to defend the rights of its \n\nnationals who were victims of human rights violations committed by other states. Some \n\nconcluding remarks ensue.  \n\n \n\n5.1 International law as language \n\n \n\nIn his treatise on the structure of international legal argumentation, Koskenniemi \n\nposited the thesis that international law has a \u2018\u2026 \u201cgrammar\u201d which controls the production \n\nof particular arguments within discourse and which counts for the lawyer\u2019s specific legal \n\n\u201ccompetence\u201d\u2019,4 defined by him as \u2018\u2026 the ability to use grammar in order to generate \n\nmeaning by doing things in argument.\u20195 Said grammar imposes limitations related to how \n\ncompetently arguments may be presented, but not to substantive outcomes: competent \n\n                                                \n4 Martti Koskenniemi (n 3) 11. \n5 ibid 571. \n\n\n\n193  \n\nlawyers are able to defend conflicting positions in a legal dispute, and thus justify different \n\nsubstantive outcomes.6 As summarized by Koskenniemi: \n\n \n\u2018The argumentative architecture allows any decision, and thus also the critique of any decision \n\nwithout the question of the professional competence of the decision-maker ever arising. \n\nParticipants and observers will continue to disagree on the particular interpretations of the facts \n\nand the law, but the disagreements will remain internal to the profession \u2026 They are matters of \n\n\u201cfeel\u201d and choice; they are the politics of international law. This does not mean that decisions \n\nwould be random or difficult to predict \u2026 Competent lawyers are aware of patterns and \n\ntendencies. In any language, some expressions are used more than other expressions. This is \n\nnot a function of the grammar, however, but of the social and cultural context in which native \n\nspeakers act.\u20197 \n\n \n\nThe distinction made by Ferdinand de Saussure, in his Cours de linguistique \n\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale, between langue and parole provides one way to better picture this relationship \n\nbetween the grammar of international law and the possibility of employing it to produce \n\nopposing, but equally competent, legal arguments.  \n\nSaussure emphasizes the difficulty of establishing the object of linguistics due to \n\nthe constant duality that characterizes the linguistic phenomenon. 8  Syllables, says \n\nSaussure, are \u2018acoustic impressions\u2019 perceived by the ear, but they would not exist without \n\nvocal organs.9 Sound, a \u2018complex acoustic-vocal unity\u2019, composes with the idea a complex \n\nphysiologic and mental unity.10 According to Saussure, the langage is also characterized \n\nby dualities: it has a social and an individual aspect and it implies at the same time an \n\nestablished and an evolving system.11 Saussure\u2019s solution to the problem posed is to focus \n\non the langue, which can, according to him, be autonomously defined.12  \n\nThe langage \u2018\u2026 est multiforme et h\u00e9t\u00e9roclite ; \u00e0 cheval sur plusieurs domaines, \u00e0 la \n\nfois physique, physiologique et psychique \u2026 il ne se laisse classer dans aucune cat\u00e9gorie \n\ndes faits humains, parce qu\u2019on ne sait comment d\u00e9gager son unit\u00e9.\u201913 The langue is an \n\nessential part of the langage, being \u2018\u2026 \u00e0 la fois un produit social de la facult\u00e9 du langage \n                                                \n6 Koskenniemi (n 3) 570-511. Koskenniemi also adds that \u2018winning\u2019 or \u2018losing\u2019 a case is more related to the \nbiases and preferences of the institution before which the arguments are presented than to the worth of the \narguments themselves.  \n7 ibid 589 (emphasis added). \n8 Ferdinand de Saussure, Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (Payot 1995) 23-24.  \n9 ibid.  \n10 ibid.  \n11 ibid.  \n12 ibid 25.  \n13 ibid.  \n\n\n\n194  \n\net un ensemble de conventions n\u00e9cessaires, adopt\u00e9es par le corps social pour permettre \n\nl\u2019exercice de cette facult\u00e9 chez les individus.\u201914 According to Saussure, whilst the langue  \n\nis social and essential, the parole is individual and accessory.15 Saussure provides the link \n\nbetween langue and parole when he indicates that the langue is a repository furnished \n\nthrough the practice of parole by the members of a community, ie it is a grammatical \n\nsystem that, although existing in each brain of a given community, exists perfectly only in \n\nthe group considered as a whole.16 The langue is, in a way, presupposed when exercising \n\nthe parole, which is \u2018\u2026 un acte individuel de volont\u00e9 et d\u2019intelligence\u2019, comprising \u2018les \n\ncombinaisons par lesquelles le sujet parlant utilise le code de la langue en vue d\u2019exprimer \n\nsa pens\u00e9e personnelle\u2019 and \u2018le m\u00e9canisme psycho-physique qui lui permet d\u2019ext\u00e9rioriser \n\nces combinaisons.\u201917 The relationship between the two is of interdependence: without the \n\nlangue, one could not understand the parole, which would be deprived of effects; at the \n\nsame time, without the parole, the langue could not have established itself in the first \n\nplace.18  \n\nKoskenniemi intended not to merely examine international law \u2018like a language\u2019, \n\nbut to treat it \u2018as a language\u2019.19 According to him, this approach has the advantage of \n\naccounting for two very pronounced features of international legal argumentation: its sense \n\nof \u2018rigorous formalism\u2019 and its \u2018substantive open-endedness\u2019.20 Whilst there may be a \n\nmyriad of possible solutions (which could also be referred as arguments or doctrines) to a \n\ngiven legal problem or dispute, if one wishes to be heard and to proficiently support a \n\nparticular one, it is necessary to follow rigid patterns of argumentation accepted by the \n\n\u2018invisible college of international lawyers\u2019, to use the expression of Oscar Schachter21. \n\nThese arguments and doctrines are, in Saussurean terminology, the parole of international \n\nlaw. As in any other language, to be able to produce parole, it is necessary to know the \n\nlangue\u2013\u2013in Saussure\u2019s words, \u2018la langue \u2026 est la partie sociale du langage, ext\u00e9rieure \u00e0 \n\n                                                \n14 Saussure (n 8) 25.  \n15 ibid 30.  \n16 ibid 30.  \n17 ibid 30-31 (footnotes omitted).  \n18 ibid 36-38. \n19 Koskenniemi (n 3) 568.  \n20 ibid 562-566.  \n21 Oscar Schachter, \u2018The Invisible College of International Lawyers\u2019 (1977-1978) 72 NwULRev 217, 217. \nOscar Schachter elaborated on this concept at an ASIL meeting in 2001. See Miekej. Clincy, \u2018An Interview \nwith Oscar Schachter\u2019 (2001) 95 ASILP 18. \n\n\n\n195  \n\nl\u2019individu, qui \u00e0 lui seul ne peut ni cr\u00e9er ni la modifier \u2026 l\u2019individu a besoin d\u2019un \n\napprentissage pour en conna\u00eetre le jeu \u2026\u201922.  \n\nThrough the process of learning the langue of international law, a structure, which \n\nconstrains what can be said, is internalized, although one may not be aware of it.23 As \n\nKoskenniemi pointed out:  \n\n \n\u2018At the parole level, human agents appear as conscious builders of the world. At the langue \n\nlevel they work within the possibilities offered by a historically given code which the actors \n\nare routinely unable to transgress. Analogously, \u2026 arguments and doctrines about international \n\nlaw are only a contingent surface of a socially shared manner of envisaging international \n\nrelations. \u2026 [T]his cannot be a code which is somehow \u201cinherent\u201d in the contexts in which we \n\nuse it. It has neither descended from heaven to determine what we can see in international life, \n\nnor emerged as an aprioristic construction of an autonomous individual.\u201924 \n\n \n\nThe core of Koskenniemi\u2019s thesis is that international law is founded on a liberal \n\ntheory of politics and reproduces the contradictions found therein. According to \n\nKoskenniemi, this theory assumes law\u2019s objectivity, ie its dual character as simultaneously \n\nnormative and concrete. Koskenniemi asserts that the grammar of international law is \n\ngoverned by these two elements: concreteness and normativity. The former expresses the \n\nunderstanding that law \u2018emerges from the legal subjects\u201925; the latter, the understanding \n\nthat law binds the legal subjects regardless of their wills26. In other words, there is a \n\ndistinction between law-creation (the realm of subjectivity) and law-ascertainment (the \n\nrealm of objectivity).27 Without concreteness, law would seem utopian, disconnected from \n\nreality\u2013\u2013it would amount to \u2018natural morality\u2019.28 If normativity were lacking, law would \n\nseem apologist, incapable of providing a standard against which state behavior could be \n\nassessed.29  \n\n                                                \n22 Saussure (n 8) 31. \n23 Koskenniemi (n 3) 10-12 and 615. \n24 ibid 11 (footnotes omitted). \n25 ibid 21. \n26 ibid 23. \n27 ibid. \n28 ibid 20. \n29 ibid 20, 67 and 600. Koskenniemi pointed out that his argument, according to which \u2018international law is \nsingularly useless as a means for justifying or criticizing international behavior\u2019, is often misunderstood. See \nKoskenniemi (n 3) 600: \n \n\n\u2018Taken out of its context, this is wrong\u2014for international law is constantly used to justify or \ncriticize international behaviour. In the context where it appears, however, its point remains \nvalid: although international law has justifying or critical force, that force is inexplicable by the \n\n\n\n196  \n\nTo Koskenniemi, concreteness and normativity are ultimately incompatible. \n\nNonetheless, in order to maintain that international law cannot be reduced to neither \u2018social \n\ndescription\u2019 nor \u2018political prescription\u201930, international lawyers have to show \u2018law is \n\nsimultaneously normative and concrete\u2014that it binds a State regardless of that State\u2019s \n\nbehavior, will or interest but that its content can nevertheless be verified by reference to \n\nactual State behavior, will or interest.\u201931 Koskenniemi labeled this approach the \u2018social \n\nconception of international law\u2019. As defined by him: \n\n \n\u2018The social conception proceeds from an agnostic view on value and a functional notion of \n\nsociety. Its central problem is how to cope with the tension between the (arbitrary) values held \n\nby members of society and the need for order so as to sustain social life.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 The difficulty now becomes how to extract \u2018international law\u2019 from other aspects of social \n\nlife among States, i.e. how to distinguish between political and legal obligation, convenience \n\nand custom, violence and enforcement. Inasmuch as recourse to ideas about the good life is \n\nexcluded, in making these distinctions, jurists have assumed this to be a technical or a \n\npragmatic approach. Simultaneously, theory has been reduced to methodology: practical \n\nguidelines for isolating what is law and what is politics in what States do or say.\u201932 \n\n \n\nThe belief on law\u2019s objectivity, which is the cornerstone of the social conception of \n\nlaw, was once taken to extremes, as demonstrated by the doctrine of the limitation of the \n\njudicial process, which, as described by Lauterpacht, contended that some disputes were \n\nnot justiciable due to: (i) the non-existence of applicable rules of law; (ii) the subject-\n\nmatter of the dispute being related to important interests of states; (iii) the undesirability \n\nand the incompatibility with the demands of justice of the result of the application of the \n\nexisting rules; (iv) the controversy being related to conflicts of interests and not disputes as \n\nto rights.33 In other words, the understanding underlying this doctrine is that some disputes \n\nare not justiciable if their content is, in one way or another, political.  \n\n                                                                                                                                              \nliberal political theory that is invoked as its foundation. If we take liberalism seriously, then \ninternational law can only seem an abysmal fraud.\u2019 \n\n \n30 Koskenniemi (n 3) 16. \n31 ibid 25. \n32 Martti Koskennimi, \u2018Theory: Implications for the Practitioner\u2019 in P. Allott et al (eds), Theory and \nInternational Law: An Introduction (BIICL 1991), 6-7. \n33 Hersch Lauterpacht, The Function of Law in the International Community (Clarendon Press 1933). See \nalso Koskenniemi (n 3) 28-29 (footnotes omitted): \n \n\n\u2018The basic position about the objectivity of international law is clearest within the doctrines of \nthe judicial function. Their identity as distinct doctrines depends on the way they explain the \nlaw-ascertainment job as more objective than the legislative one. \n\n\n\n197  \n\nThe embodiment of this doctrine in a treaty can be exemplified by the Locarno \n\nPact. Article 3.2 of the Locarno Pact established that \u2018[a]ny question with regard to which \n\nthe Parties are in conflict as to it respective rights shall be submitted to judicial decision\u2019, \n\nwhilst Article 3.3 provided that \u2018[a]ll other questions shall be submitted to a conciliation \n\ncommission.\u201934 \n\nLauterpacht wrote one of his major works, The Function of Law in the \n\nInternational Community, precisely to counter this idea, which, according to him, was an \n\nattempt to conciliate sovereignty with the demands by the international community and \n\npublic opinion in favor of treaties providing for the judicial settlement of disputes35\u2013\u2013in his \n\nwords, this doctrine was \u2018first and foremost, the work of international lawyers anxious to \n\ngive legal expression to the State\u2019s claim to be independent of law.\u201936  \n\nBeing a natural lawyer who proposed that the \u2018initial hypothesis\u2019 of international \n\nlaw ought to be considered the \u2018will of the international community\u2019\u2014voluntas civitatis \n\nmaximae est servanda, as opposed to the traditional rule pacta sunt servanda37 \u2014\n\nLauterpacht believed in the material completeness of international law: \n \n\n\u2018\u2026 [T]he necessary aim of any legal system is also material completeness. In order to achieve \n\nthat material completeness the judge must consider not only the letter of the law, but also its \n\nspirit and purpose.  \n\n\u2018\u2026 The conception of the completeness of the legal order is a beneficent notion inasmuch as it \n\nexcludes the anarchical possibilities of a non liquet. But there is little doubt that this very \n\nnotion may obstruct the path of the law by being used as a justification for the renunciation on \n\nthe part of the judge of his power to apply the existing law in a just, creative, and scientific \n\nmanner.\u201938 \n\n  \n\n                                                                                                                                              \n\u2018The classic separation of justiciable from non-justiciable disputes is one manner of upholding \nthis distinction. In late 19th and early 20th century doctrines it was largely assumed that the \nprevalence of subjective State interests in some disputes rendered them incapable of legal \nsettlement or that trying to find a general rule with which to solve them was pointless as the \nsubjective interests would in any case overrule any attempt at legal solution. It has, however, \nbeen impossible to make a clear distinction between these two types of disputes. \u2026\u2019 \n\n \n34 Treaty of Mutual Guarantee between Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Italy (The Locarno \nPact) (adopted 16 October 1925, entered into force 14 September 1926) \n<http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/locarno_001.asp> accessed 26 November 2015.   \n35 Lauterpacht (n 33) 4-5. \n36 ibid 6. \n37 ibid 420-423. \n38 ibid 86. See also Koskenniemi (n 3) 52-56. \n\n\n\n198  \n\n Lauterpacht\u2019s conception of international law allowed him to question the idea that \n\nthe intrinsic character of some disputes had as a result their non-amenability to the rule of \n\nlaw\u2014at the same time, his conception was still informed by the idea of objectivity.39 \n\nIn any case, Koskenniemi grounds his thesis on a completely different basis than \n\nthat of Lauterpacht, namely on the idea that objectivity at the level of law-ascertainment is \n\na myth. As Koskenniemi explains, his idea about the indeterminacy of international law \n\ndoes not relate to semantic ambiguity or ambivalence: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [E]ven where there is no semantic ambivalence whatsoever, international law remains \n\nindeterminate because it is based on contradictory premises and seeks to regulate a future in \n\nregard to which even single actors\u2019 preferences remain unsettled. To say this is not to say much \n\nmore than that international law emerges from a political process whose participants have \n\ncontradictory priorities and rarely know with clarity how such priorities should be turned into \n\ndirectives to deal with an uncertain future. Hence they agree to supplement rules with \n\nexceptions, have recourse to broadly defined standards and apply rules in the context of other \n\nrules and larger principles. Even where there is little or no semantic ambiguity about an \n\nexpression in a rule \u2026 that expression cannot quite have the normative force we would like it to \n\nhave.\u201940 \n\n \n\nThis indeterminacy, which Koskenniemi in fact considers essential to international \n\nlaw\u2019s acceptability, is, in his view, linked to the fact that, inasmuch as rules have to fulfill \n\n                                                \n39 See Koskenniemi (n 3) 52-53 (footnotes omitted): \n \n\n\u2018For Lauterpacht, the legal system controls effectively all the outcomes of legal decision-\nmaking. There is a positive duty on the judge (lawyer) to decide the cases brought to him, to \ndetermine the parties\u2019 rights and duties. But exclusionary residual rules\u2014such as the \npresumption of the freedom of the State\u2014cannot suffice. Contrary to Kelsen, Lauterpacht does \nnot postulate formal but material completeness of the law, constructed by the lawyer as he \nproceeds to solve the case. But this construction is neither arbitrary nor based on abstract \nprinciples of justice or derivations from the nature of the thing. It is more than an effort to \nascertain community consensus or the actual background purposes. For Lauterpacht, legal \nproblem-solution seeks to ensure the unity, consistency and effectiveness of international law \nas a whole. By using analogy and abstracting general principles from individual rules the \nlawyer will be able to perceive the law as a coherent, meaningful whole which \u201cis originally \nand ultimately not so much a body of legal rules as a body of legal principles\u201d. These \nprinciples express the law\u2019s autonomous, systemic \u201ccoherence\u201d which ultimately justifies the \nsolution of hard cases.\u2019 \n\n \n40 ibid 590-591. \n\n\n\n199  \n\npurposes that are conflicting among actors and not consistent throughout time, there is a \n\nrisk that they will be over-inclusive and under-inclusive.41  \n\nThe point about the over-inclusiveness and under-inclusiveness of rules can \n\nperhaps be illustrated by the distinction Thomas Franck proposed between idiot and \n\nsophist rules. In Franck\u2019s definition, idiot rules are characterized by their clarity, precision \n\nand transparency.42 They manifest what Franck calls a what-based normativity, in the \n\nsense that they are concerned with what was done.43 Sophist rules, on the other hand, are \n\ncharacterized by their \u2018multi-layered complexity\u2019 and their elasticity, as, for instance, \n\n\u2018[n]orms setting out standards of compliance which are measured in complex qualitative \n\nterms, or which are hedged by why and to whom exculpations, [and they] may be difficult \n\nto apply to real life situations.\u201944 The determinacy of a sophist rule will depend \u2018\u2026 on the \n\ndegree of common community understanding of the rule\u2019s complex content and \u2026 on the \n\nperceived legitimacy of the process by which the rule is applied.\u201945 As regards application, \n\nThomas Franck considers that \u2018[w]hile an idiot rule more-or-less applies itself, sophist \n\nrules usually require an effective, credible, institutionalized, and legitimate interpreter of \n\nthe rule\u2019s meaning in various instances.\u201946 As Franck puts it, however, it is not the case that \n\nidiot rules will always be more determinate than sophist rules\u2014the precision of an idiot \n\nrule may have the effect of actually undermining its determinacy. Franck explains this \n\nsituation in the following way: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026[C]larity, while often an indicator of determinacy, may occasionally produce results which \n\nare so at variance with common sense that the clear meaning of the rule is rejected by those \n\nwhose conduct the rule is intended to govern. A rule which appears to be perfectly clear \n\nunintentionally may command what turns out to be an absurdity. Indeed, the simpler, clearer, and \n\n                                                \n41 Koskenniemi (n 3) 591-592. Koskenniemi explains that the force of rules is undermined because of issues \nrelated to their over-inclusiveness and under-inclusiveness, and, as a consequence, \u2018discretion\u2019 is encouraged. \nSee Koskenniemi (n 3) 591-592: \n  \n\n\u2018\u2026 The rules will include future cases we would not like to include and exclude cases that we \nwould have wanted to include had we known of them when the rules were drafted. This \nfundamentally\u2014and not just marginally\u2014undermines their force. It compels the move to \n\u201cdiscretion\u201d which it was the very purpose to avoid by adopting the rule-format in the first \nplace.\u2019 \n\n \n42 Thomas Franck, The Power of Legitimacy Among Nations (OUP 1990) 71-77. \n43 ibid 75-77. \n44 ibid 74-75 and 79. \n45 ibid 80. \n46 ibid 81. \n\n\n\n200  \n\nmore straightforward a rule is, the greater is its propensity to produce an unintended absurdity, \n\nusually in unforeseen circumstances. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [D]espite its superficial clarity, the [idiot] rule\u2014under certain circumstances\u2014does not \n\nsatisfy the test of common sense or fairness; and thus, deprived of the compliance pull its clear \n\nstandard was meant to assure, the rule also will not accurately predict the actual conduct of \n\nstates. This is because a literal reading of the rule can lead to absurd results at the margins of its \n\napplication.\u201947 \n\n \n\n Franck utilizes Articles 2.4 and 51 of the UN Charter to exemplify an international \n\nidiot rule. Article 2.4 establishes the general prohibition of the use of force, whilst Article \n\n51 preserves a state\u2019s inherent right of self-defense. Prima facie, the rule according to \n\nwhich a state cannot initiate the use of force, but only respond to an actual armed attack is \n\nhighly determinate. However, as Franck points out, \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 a literal reading of the rule can lead to absurd results at the margins of its application. For \n\nexample it would compel a state threatened by a nuclear attack to wait until it had actually been \n\nhit (\u201carmed attack\u201d) before permitting the use of force in self-defense. In less dramatic \n\ncircumstances, the rule would require even a state like Israel or Singapore to wait until after an \n\narmed attack before striking back, by which time its minute territory might well have been \n\noverrun. Such a rule lacks essential legitimacy, because it is evidently absurd. It is easy to \n\npredict that no state would abide by its strictures in at least some situations, as Israel \n\ndemonstrated by destroying the Iraqi nuclear reactor in an air raid \u2026 [T]he clear meaning of the \n\nrule is not determinate because the members of the community to which it applies have already \n\ndecided that, in at least some circumstances, the rule cannot mean what it says.\u201948 \n\n  \n\n At the domestic level, the problems relating to idiot and sophist rules are usually \n\ndealt with by courts, which may refuse to apply idiot rules in a literal manner if it leads to \n\nabsurd results and may clarify the content of elastic sophist rules.49 It is then expected that, \n\nin international law, the problems related to idiot and sophist rules will be more acutely \n\nfelt, due to the lack of international compulsory jurisdiction.  \n\n The nature of international law\u2019s indeterminacy, in Koskenniemi\u2019s view, is not then \n\nrelated to the lack of clarity of legal norms\u2014indeed, Franck demonstrated that the clarity \n\nof a legal rule may even contribute to its indeterminateness. As Koskenniemi explains, \n\n \n\n                                                \n47 Franck (n 42) 68 and 76. \n48 ibid 76. \n49 ibid 78-79 and 82-83. \n\n\n\n201  \n\n\u2018[t]here is nothing necessarily unclear about \u201cif an armed attack occurs\u201d or \u201cterritorial \n\ninviolability\u201d or \u201cright to life\u201d. The indeterminacy is about the relationship of those expressions \n\nto their underlying reasons and to other rules and principles that makes it sometimes seem \n\nnecessary to deviate from a formally unambiguous provision in view of new information or a \n\nnew circumstance, to sacrifice a smaller good (abstract legality) in view of realizing a larger one. \n\n\u2018\u2026 \n\n\u2018\u2026 [E]ven a \u201cliteral\u201d application is always a choice that is undetermined by literality itself. \n\nThere is no space in international law that would be \u201cfree\u201d from decisionism, no aspect of the \n\nlegal craft that would not involve a \u201cchoice\u201d\u2014that would not be, in this sense, a politics of \n\ninternational law.\u201950 \n\n  \n\n To pick up on a point raised in the beginning of this section, indeterminacy does \n\nnot mean that a judicial decision is random or unpredictable or that \u2018anything goes\u2019. \n\nInternational law has an inter-subjective dimension: doctrines can attain professional \n\nconsensus and some theoretical trends may be more widespread among the professional \n\ncommunity than others. And, as pointed out by Koskenniemi, structural biases play a \n\ncrucial role. As he highlights, \u2018the system still de facto prefers some outcomes or \n\ndistributive choices to other outcomes or choices.\u201951  \n\nKoskenniemi\u2019s thesis about the indeterminacy of international law highlights the \n\nfact that there is nothing inherent about current preferred outcomes. They remain \n\ncontingent and can be contested through the language of international law: \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 [T]he fluidity of international law does not deny the fact that there exists at any one time a \n\nprofessional consensus or a mainstream answer to any particular problem. Although, logically \n\nspeaking, all positions remain open and contrasting arguments may be reproduced at will, in \n\npractice it is easy to identify areas of relative stability, moments where a mainstream has \n\nconsolidated or is only marginally threatened by critique. Professional competence in \n\ninternational law is precisely about being able to identify the hegemonic and counter-hegemonic \n\nnarratives and to list one\u2019s services in favour of one or the other.\u201952 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n50 Koskenniemi (n 3) 595-596. \n51 ibid 606-607. \n52 ibid 607. \n\n\n\n202  \n\n5.2 The debate on the relationship between state immunity and human rights as a \n\nconflict of conceptions of international law  \n\n \n\n5.2.1 The role of theory \n\n \n\nIn analyzing the various cases dealing with the relationship between state immunity \n\nand human rights, courts had to answer a multitude of questions. Is state immunity a rule \n\nof customary international law? Or is it only an expression of comity? Is it underpinned by \n\nthe principle of sovereign equality and a consequence of the maxim par in parem non \n\nhabet imperium? Or is it an exception to the principle of adjudicatory jurisdiction? Is state \n\nimmunity functional and should it only be accorded when it promotes the interests of the \n\ncommunity of states? Can gross violations of international humanitarian law and of \n\ninternational human rights law be considered acta jure imperii? Or are they delicta imperii \n\nthat do not fit the dichotomy between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis? Is there a \n\ntort exception to state immunity under customary international law? If so, does it allow \n\npiercing the veil of state immunity for acta jure imperii and for acts committed by armed \n\nforces in the territory of the forum state? Does a state tacitly waive its right to immunity by \n\nviolating a jus cogens norm? Or no such waiver can be implied from this act? Do jus \n\ncogens norms have a substantive nature that does not affect the operation of procedural \n\nnorms? Or is the distinction between procedural and substantive norms immaterial to the \n\nconcept of jus cogens? Are the effects of jus cogens limited to restricting the contractual \n\nliberty of states? Do jus cogens norms take primacy over other norms of international law \n\nwhen there is a material, but not a formal, conflict between them? Is the grant of state \n\nimmunity in cases involving gross violations of human rights outside the jurisdiction of the \n\nforum state a violation of the individual\u2019s right of access to justice? Or is it a lawful \n\nlimitation of this right because it is a measure which reflects generally recognized rules of \n\npublic international law and which pursues the legitimate aim of promoting good relations \n\nbetween states? Are states required under Article 14 of the CAT to provide a remedy for \n\nacts of torture committed outside the forum state? Or are they required only to provide a \n\nremedy for acts of torture committed in the forum state? Does Article 3 of the Hague \n\nConvention (IV) of 1907 confer a right to reparation to individuals? Or are the effects of \n\nthis provision limited to inter-state relations? Can the ascertainment of customary \n\ninternational law be limited to a quantitative approach? Or is it a qualitative approach \n\nrequired?  \n\n\n\n203  \n\nThese are all questions underlying the many cases previously analyzed. And \n\ndifferent answers were offered to them by the various courts. The argument of this \n\nmonograph is that the answers to these technical and dogmatic questions hide conflicts that \n\nexist\u2014to use Martti Koskenniemi\u2019s expression\u2014at a \u2018higher level of abstraction\u2019.53 They \n\nhide conflicts about different conceptions of international law, ie about what international \n\nlaw is and about how to find it out. The aforementioned questions do not have answers that \n\ncan be ascertained objectively. Different theoretical assumptions can lead to conflicting \n\nanswers. And a given preferred outcome or decision is contingent and remains open to \n\ncontestation. Oscar Schachter, for instance, in an article in which he tried to come up with \n\na \u2018more adequate theory\u2019 of the basis of obligation in international law given the \n\nemergence of new normative processes which could not easily fit in the categories of treaty \n\nand customary law, listed  \n\n \n\u2018\u2026 at least a baker\u2019s dozen of  \u201ccandidates\u201d \u2026 : (i) Consent of States; (ii) Customary practice; \n\n(iii) A sense of \u201crightness\u201d\u2013\u2013the juridical conscience; (iv) Natural law or natural reason; (v) \n\nSocial necessity; (vi) The will of the international community (the \u201cconsensus of the \n\ninternational community\u201d); (vii) Direct (or \u201cstigmatic\u201d) intuition; (viii) Common purposes of \n\nparticipants; (ix) Effectiveness; (x) Sanctions; (xi) \u201cSystemic\u201d goals; (xii) Shared expectations as \n\nto authority; (xiii) Rules of recognition \u2026\u201954 \n\n \n\n It is not within the purposes of this monograph to dwell upon Schachter\u2019s own \n\nproposal, a task for which he relied on the works of Harold Lasswell and Myres \n\nMcDougal, but I share his view that these foundational issues matter because they have \n\npractical significance and are important to the outcome of concrete controversies.55  \n\nAlthough in the cases surveyed some of the courts engaged in, to use Philippa \n\nWebb\u2019s expression, a \u2018high level of judicial dialogue\u201956, inasmuch as they cited and \n\ndiscussed other courts\u2019 decisions, sometimes it felt like they were talking past one another, \n\ndue to the adoption of different theoretical premises. As Koskenniemi highlighted: \n\n \n\n                                                \n53 Koskenniemi (n 3) 3. \n54 Oscar Schachter, \u2018Towards a Theory of International Obligation\u2019 in Stephen M. Schwebel (ed), The \nEffectiveness of International Legal Decisions (Oceana Publications 1971), 9-10 (footnotes omitted).  \n55 ibid 11 and 31. \n56 Philippa Webb, \u2018Immunities and Human Rights: Dissecting the Dialogue in National and International \nCourts\u2019 in Ole Kristian Fauchald and Andr\u00e9 Nollkaemper (eds), The Practice of International and National \nCourts and the (De-)Fragmentation of International Law (Hart 2012), 250.  \n\n\n\n204  \n\n\u2018Whether the difficulty regards the sense of \u201crules\u201d or the meaning of \u201cfacts\u201d, the problem is that \n\nthe theories and intuitions which may justify differing constructions are, by definition, external \n\nto the rules of facts themselves and do not, therefore, lend themselves to a discussion within the \n\nsocial conception [of law]. Nevertheless, the practical need for action compels the practitioner \n\ninto a justification that at least addresses the normative claims which underlie the particular \n\ncontroversy and the differing views that exist for its solution, and establishes some kind of a \n\nreasoned balance or priority between them.  \n\n\u2018It is an illusion to believe that there could be a \u201ctheory\u201d or \u201cmethod\u201d which could solve such \n\ninterpretative problems in a final way. States will continue to disagree about applicable law and \n\nits correct interpretation. This is not a result of the law\u2019s poor quality of the statesman\u2019s bad \n\nfaith. Law carries political struggle within itself by receiving meaning only in frameworks of \n\ninterpretation that reflect political priorities. The practitioners will continue to have some \n\ndifficulty in coping with this fact. But the persistence of interpretative controversy is not really a \n\n\u201cproblem\u201d to be solved by a better theory of method\u2014it is the fundamental condition which \n\ndefines what international legal practice is about.\u201957 \n\n \n\nDespite having such a great influence, theoretical assumptions are usually \n\nembedded in an implicit way in the discourses found in legal texts. This happens because \n\n\u2018reification\u2019\u2014which could be defined as \u2018\u2026 an attempt to deny both \u201ccontingency\u201d and \n\nchoice by incorporating some political decision about a subject into the description of that \n\nsubject\u201958 or as \u2018the way we turn other people, or social systems, or institutional hierarchies \n\ninto objects which we then confront as disempowered observers\u201959\u2014is pervasive in the \n\npractice of international legal argumentation. In other words, the authoritativeness of a \n\ntechnical, dogmatic argument is founded on the assumption that it derives from sound, \n\nunquestionable and neutral theoretical premises about the nature of international law. And, \n\nas a matter of fact, these theoretical premises incorporate choices. As James Boyle argued: \n\n \n\u2018Doctrinal scholarship often appears to be an attempt to show that rules can achieve determinacy, \n\nto show that there are correct interpretations of international legal norms. My claim is that this \n\nattempt is only explicable as the objectified manifestation of a different, more contentious \n\npolitical project. International lawyers are not attempting to show that rules are definite, firm and \n\npredictable because they believe this exercise will be good for their health. Their aspiration is to \n\nshow that international law is a legitimate system for constraining power and irrationality, and, \n\n                                                \n57 Koskenniemi (n 32) 44. \n58 James Boyle, \u2018Ideals and Things: International Legal Scholarship and the Prison-House of Language\u2019 26 \nHILJ 327, 328-329. \n59 ibid 352. \n\n\n\n205  \n\nin their minds, they carry the assumption that it could only be such a system if there are neutral, \n\nobjective answers to legal questions. \n\n\u2018\u2026 The dominant background conception of \u201creason,\u201d self-interest and politics\u2014and the utopian \n\nvision of power constrained by rules that is generated within that conception\u2014seem to require a \n\nset of a-political rules. Since the mark of a neutral set of rules is their ability to provide one \n\nlogically correct answer to each case, both the compulsive denial of contradiction and the \n\ndoctrinal structure that this denial \u201cgenerates\u201d can be seen as products of the initial reification\u2014\n\nthe attempt to define \u201cwhat law is,\u201d in order to separate it conceptually from morals and political \n\nargument.\u201960 \n\n \n\nThere is nothing inherently right or wrong about the answers provided by the \n\nvarious courts on the questions relating to the relationship between state immunity and \n\nhuman rights. The answers offered will have varying degrees of persuasiveness that \n\ndepend not only on their intrinsic attributes, like internal coherence, but also on the \n\naudience (eg, the acceptability by the audience of the premises of a given answer to a legal \n\nquestion, the biases of the audience etc.).61 \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Consensus and dissension, law-breaking and law-making \n\n \n\nIn the case of state immunity, most courts adopted what could be called an \n\northodox, textbook approach to state immunity. They saw state immunity as underpinned \n\nby the principle of sovereign equality of states and as an expression of the Latin maxim \n\npar in parem non habet imperium. A distinction between procedure and substance was \n\nemployed in order to preclude the effects of (substantive) jus cogens norms in the realm of \n\n(procedural) state immunity. Also, most courts adopted state immunity as the starting point \n\nof analysis\u2014an exception in respect of human rights and jus cogens violations had thus to \n\nbe found in the practice of states. And, as considered previously, this type of analysis gave \n\nrise to what Roger O\u2019Keefe called a \u2018customary international legal feedback loop\u201962, which \n\nwas well received by the ICJ. Through its quantitative approach to customary international \n\nlaw, the ICJ may have crystallized the consensus according to which state immunity \n\ntrumps the individual\u2019s right to reparation arising out of serious violations of human rights.  \n\n                                                \n60 Boyle (n 58) 347 and 356. \n61 See Andrea Bianchi, \u2018Gazing at the Crystal Ball (again): State Immunity and Jus Cogens beyond Germany \nv Italy\u2019 (2013) 4(3) JIDS 457, 467. \n62 Roger O\u2019Keefe, \u2018State Immunity and Human Rights: Heads and Walls, Hearts and Minds\u2019 (2011) 44 \nVandJTL 999, 1017. \n\n\n\n206  \n\nNevertheless, many dissenting voices emerged. In the Princz case, the decision of \n\nDistrict Judge Sporkin and the dissenting opinion of Judge Wald. In Greece, Judgment No \n\n137/1997 of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia, Judgment No 11/2000 of the Areios \n\nPagos, and the dissenting opinion appended to the judgment of the Special Supreme Court \n\nin Germany v Margellos and Other. In the ECtHR, the dissenting opinions appended to Al-\n\nAdsani and Jones. Judge Can\u00e7ado Trindade appended a dissenting opinion to the judgment \n\nof the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State in which he disagreed with the \n\nreasoning adopted by the ICJ as a whole. Can\u00e7ado Trindade made his jusnaturalist \n\nperspective clear. In his view, the ultimate material source of law is the \u2018universal juridical \n\nconscience\u2019 and the inter-state outlook of international law is something that ought to be \n\novercome. Can\u00e7ado Trindade, so to speak, found that international law had a different \n\nGrundnorm and reached conclusions which were in stark opposition to those of the \n\nmajority of the ICJ.63  \n\nThe case-law of the Italian Court of Cassation is the one that stood out the most. It \n\nadopted an entirely different approach as regards the role of domestic courts in the \n\napplication of international law.64 The Italian Court of Cassation took on an active role and \n\nemphasized its self-awareness by stating that it was conscious that it was contributing to \n\nthe emergence of further restrictions to the scope of state immunity.  \n\nGeorge Scelle\u2019s theory of role splitting (\u2018la loi du d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel\u2019) can \n\nperhaps shed light on the attitude of the Italian courts. Scelle, in the course he taught at the \n\nHague Academy in 1933, explained what he called the \u2018loi du d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel\u2019 \n\nin the following terms:  \n\n \n\u2018... [i]l en r\u00e9sulte que, dans l\u2019ordre inter\u00e9tatique, o\u00f9 il n\u2019existe pas de gouvernants et agents \n\nsp\u00e9cifiquement internationaux, les agents et gouvernants \u00e9tatiques qui les remplacent sont \n\ninvestis d\u2019un double r\u00f4le. Ils sont agents et gouvernants nationaux lorsqu\u2019ils fonctionnent dans \n\nl\u2019ordre juridique \u00e9tatique; ils sont agents et gouvernants internationaux lorsqu\u2019ils agissent dans \n\nl\u2019ordre juridique international. C\u2019est ce que nous appellerons la loi fondamentale du \n\nd\u00e9doublement fonctionnel. \n\n                                                \n63 See Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of \nJudge Can\u00e7ado Trindade) [2012] ICJ Rep 99 and Rosalyn Higgins, \u2018Equality of States and Immunity from \nSuit: A Complex Relationship\u2019 (2015) 43 NYIL 129, 146-148.  \n64 See Rosanne van Alebeek, \u2018Domestic Courts as Agents of Development of International Immunity Rules\u2019 \n(2013) 26(3) LJIL 559 and Anthea Roberts, \u2018Comparative International Law? The Role of National Courts in \nCreating and Enforcing International Law\u2019 (2011) 60 ICLQ 57. Both authors assessed the different \napproaches domestic courts adopted with regard to the development of the law of state immunity. The \nperspectives they presented on the subject are very distinct from each other. \n\n\n\n207  \n\n\u2018\u2026 [U]n acte n\u2019a d\u2019autre crit\u00e8re juridique que sa substance, et toutes les fois que nous nous \n\ntrouvons en face d\u2019un rapport et d\u2019une situation internationale, il en r\u00e9sulte math\u00e9matiquement \n\nque l\u2019acte juridique qui lui donne naissance est par nature un acte international.\u201965 \n\n \n\nAccording to Scelle\u2019s theory, when a domestic court delivers a decision on \n\ninternational law issues, it is acting qua an international organ because it is operating \n\nwithin the international legal system.66  \n\nFurthermore, the attitude of the Italian courts may be better understood in the light \n\nof some aspects of the process of changes in international law, in which the frontiers \n\nbetween deviance, law-development and law-creation are not very clear. As put by John \n\nMerrills, in international law, law-breaking can sometimes be a method of law-making: \n\n \n\u2018Since customary international law is based on usage, the making of new claims always has the \n\neffect of weakening the established rule. If such claims are accepted, or become sufficiently \n\nwidespread, that rule will change. Until that point is reached there is no doubt that the \n\nenforcement of a disputed claim involves a breach of a legal obligation. That international law \n\ncan change quite rapidly even on highly controversial matters is illustrated by the emergence, \n\nagainst strong opposition, of the concept of the Exclusive Economic Zone. As that experience \n\nshows, however, when breaking law is an important method of law making conflict and \n\ncontroversy are unavoidable.  \n\n\u2018... [S]ince international law is a reflection of the way states view the world, law cannot be \n\nmade when, as often is the case, their interests are in sharp conflict. When state\u2019s interests \n\nchange established principles come under challenge. In such a situation only state practice can \n\nchange the law and there will be controversy until new law emerges from the cauldron of claim \n\n                                                \n65 George Scelle, \u2018R\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du droit de la paix\u2019 (1933) 46 RCADI 327. Cassese wrote an excellent \nanalysis of Scelle\u2019s \u2018loi du d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel\u2019. See Antonio Cassese, \u2018Remarks on Scelle\u2019s Theory of \n\u201cRole Splitting\u201d (d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel) in International Law\u2019 (1990) 1(1) EJIL 210. \n66 From a formal perspective, James Crawford argued Scelle\u2019s theory fails because international law does not \nconfer on domestic courts a mandate to act as international law \u2018agencies\u2019. See James Crawford, \u2018Chance, \nOrder, Change: The Course of International Law\u2019 (2013) 365 RCADI 13, 168 and 180: \n \n\n\u2018It is true that courts sometimes use language consistent with d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel. In \nEichmann the Supreme Court of Israel stated that \u201cin the capacity of a guardian of international \nlaw and an agent for its enforcement\u201d, Israel was entitled to prosecute crimes that \u201cshake the \ninternational community to its very foundations\u201d. Similar assertions of guardianship were \nmade by the US federal courts in Fil\u00e1rtiga and Yunis ... \n\u2018But these assertions were not only equivocal; they were effectively self-judging. There was no \nspecific international mandate in either case, such as the clear authority to exercise jurisdiction \nin various suppression treaties such as the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of \nUnlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Article 5. \n\u2018\u2026 As we have seen, Scelle\u2019s theory of the d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel fails at a general level \nfor want of any mandate from international law to domestic organs, notably courts, requiring \nthem to act as international agencies.\u2019  \n\n \n\n\n\n208  \n\nand counter-claim. In that convulsive process the tendency of states to regard as legally \n\npermitted any claim successfully asserted by any state in the past invests even individual states \n\nacts with a powerful law creating potential. \n\n\u2018With the creation of international law such a decentralised process, so liable for the reasons \n\ndescribed to give rise to doubt or controversy, much clearly depends on the possibility of \n\nobtaining authoritative interpretations of the law \u2026\u201967 \n\n \n\nThe Italian Court of Cassation assumed an active role and it can be argued that it \n\nsought to engage in d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel. The Court did so in an ingenious manner. \n\nThe Court of Cassation\u2019s d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel was \u2018colored\u2019 by an attempt to further \n\ndevelop the law of state immunity.68 Perhaps to avoid the accusation it was breaking \n\n                                                \n67 John Merrills, Anatomy of International Law (2nd edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 1981) 14-15. It might be added \nAnthea Roberts asserted that, in international law, domestic courts have a legitimate role as law-creators, \nwhich can be formally justified on the doctrine of sources. See Roberts (n 64) 62-63 and 70-71 (footnotes \nomitted): \n \n\n\u2018National court decisions play a distinctive dual role in the doctrine of sources: as evidence of \nState practice, relevant to the interpretation of treaties and the formation of custom (where \ndomestic judgments play a role in law creation), and as a subsidiary means of determining the \nexistence and content of international law (where domestic judgments can be characterized as \nlaw enforcement). The resulting Janus-faced nature of domestic court decisions gives rise to \nconflicting approaches about their purpose and value. \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u2018Judicial decisions of international courts provide a subsidiary means of determining \ninternational law only. National court decisions alone have the potential to wear both hats and \nthus their value is often considered to be mixed \u2026 \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u2018Domestic court decisions\u2014like other forms of State practice emanating from legislatures and \nexecutives\u2014can constitute breaches just as they can be evidence of emulation and \nacquiescence. To argue otherwise, and to limit the role of national courts to impartial law \nenforcement only, is to deny their potential role in developing international law and to accord \ngreater power in this regard to legislatures and executives.\u2019 \n\n \nRosanne van Alebeek criticized Roberts\u2019 argument. See Alebeek (n 64) 54. \n68  See Alebeek (n 64) 572-574 and 577-78; Roberts (n 64) 68-71. Alebeek explains that Scelle\u2019s \nd\u00e9doublement fonctionnel \u2018\u2026 arguably \u2026 provides above all a normative framework\u2019 in the sense that, as a \nmatter of international law, domestic courts are expected to be faithful to international law as it stands and \nshould not have a domestic perspective on it. In this point of view, the position adopted by the Italian Court \nof Cassation in cases like Ferrini could be interpreted as a departure from d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel if it its \nunderstood that the Court violated international law. The Italian Court of Cassation, however, did not affirm \nthat it was breaking international law, but rather that it was contributing to the emergence of further \nrestrictions to state immunity that were already implicit in international law. The Court tried to frame its \nattitude as an exercise of development. Roberts argued that the Italian Court of Cassation in Ferrini fulfilled \na \u2018\u2026 \u201clegitimate\u201d function in pushing for a new interpretation of international law based on its role as a law \ncreator rather than enforcer\u2019 and contended that \u2018[c]ustomary international law is made on the back of State \npractice, including court decisions, and custom is changed through breaches of existing rules, coupled with \nemulation or acquiescence.\u2019 Alebeek criticized this perspective, claiming that it advances a \u2018\u2026 completely \nnovel take on the \u201crole splitting of domestic courts\u201d\u2019, in which, rather than a splitting between the domestic \nand the international legal order, there is a splitting, within the international legal order, between law creation \nand law enforcement. Alebeek added that \u2018[t]he process of change of custom through violation \u2026 is in any \ncase not an instrument that fits the judicial toolbox.\u2019 Another point raised by Alebeek was that the \nimportance of domestic decisions to custom formation is based on the \u2018\u2026 strong assumption that these \n\n\n\n209  \n\ninternational law, the Court of Cassation alleged that the restrictions it had found in the law \n\nof state immunity were already implicit in international law.69 In order to find out what \n\nwas already implicit in international law, the Court of Cassation adopted an approach to \n\ncustom ascertainment that radically differed from that of the other courts.  \n\nThe Court of Cassation recognized the existence of an antinomy between two \n\nprinciples of international law\u2014state immunity and the protection of inviolable human \n\nrights\u2014and asserted there was a qualitative difference between norms of customary \n\ninternational law.70 In the Court of Cassation\u2019s view, unlike the norms relating to state \n\nimmunity, the norms relating to the protection of fundamental human rights belong to the \n\nbody of jus cogens norms and take precedence over other norms of international law.71 It \n\nshould follow that a state cannot hide behind the shield of state immunity when it violated \n\nperemptory norms of international law. Given the existence of an antinomy between \n\nnorms, the Court of Cassation considered it had to coordinate them on the systematic level \n\nby making a value-oriented choice.72 By means of this coordination and on the basis of the \n\ncriterion of balancing of interests, the Court of Cassation concluded that it had to give \n\npriority to the higher ranked norms. It may be said that underlying the Court of Cassation\u2019s \n\nreasoning was the idea that legal norms are not in a vacuum\u2014indeed, the Court of \n\nCassation asserted that legal norms cannot be interpreted separately from one another, and \n\nthat jus cogens norms affected the scope of norms relating to state immunity.73 Not only \n\nthat, but on the logical level, the Court of Cassation considered it would not make sense to \n\nproclaim the primacy of certain norms and then to deprive individuals from having access \n\nto a remedy to make them effective.74  \n\nThe Court of Cassation criticized what it labeled a quantitative approach to \n\ncustomary international law. 75 The Court considered that the practice of the various \n\n                                                                                                                                              \ndecisions accurately reflect international law.\u2019 Nevertheless, Alebeek conceded that \u2018[s]ince every \napplication of a legal rule entails interpretation, and hence development, domestic courts have the ability to \nact as agents of change of international immunity rules.\u2019 As the Italian Court of Cassation showed, it is \ndoubtful whether a distinction between law-development and law-creation can be rigorously maintained.   \n69 Germany v Mantelli and Others (Case No 14201/2008) (29 May 2008) ILDC 1037 (Italian Court of \nCassation), [11]. \n70 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (13 January 2009) ILDC 1224 (Italian Court of Cassation), \n71 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (11 March 2004) ILDC 19 (Italian Court of Cassation); \nGermany v Mantelli and Others (Case No 14201/2008) (n 69); Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 70). \n72 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 70) [6]. \n73 Ferrini v Germany (Judgment No 5044/2004) (n 71) [9.2]. \n74 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 70) [7]. \n75 ibid [4]. There are indeed many difficulties related to the quantitative ascertainment of customary \ninternational law. See Roberts (n 64) 90 (footnotes omitted): \n \n\n\n\n210  \n\ndomestic courts was important, but it highlighted that, in its view, the ascertainment of \n\ncustomary international law could not be limited to arithmetically counting decisions in \n\nfavor and against a certain position. This approach would be reductive of the role played \n\nby the interpreter, who should take account, as regards customary international law norms, \n\n\u2018delle consistenza qualitativa di esse, delle interrelazioni riscontrabili tra le stesse, \n\ndell\u2019operativit\u00e0 dei nessi di interdipendenza e di collocazione gerarchica operanti in diretta \n\nfunzione del rango attribuito a ciascuna di quelle norme rispetto alla scala dei valori \n\ngeneralmente accolta dall\u2019ordinamento internazionale.\u201976  \n\nFurthermore, in Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia, the Court of Cassation coupled \n\nthe perspective on the relationship between state immunity and human rights based on a \n\nqualitative assessment of customary international law\u2014which was developed in the \n\nFerrini, Milde and Mantelli cases\u2014with a functional approach to state immunity.77 In \n\nJudgment No 238/2014, in the light of the ICJ\u2019s judgment, the Court of Cassation shifted \n\nthe focus from international jus cogens to domestic jus cogens and declared provisions of \n\nItalian law which were adopted to implement the ruling of the ICJ in Jurisdictional \n\nImmunities of the State as incompatible with the Italian Constitution.78 If in cases like \n\nFerrini, Mantelli and Milde the Court of Cassation actively applied international law and \n\nconsciously acted as an agent of the development of international law, in Judgment No \n\n238/2014 the Court of Cassation considered the pronouncement of the ICJ in Jurisdictional \n\nImmunities of the State was authoritative as a matter of international law. At the same time, \n\n                                                                                                                                              \n\u2018\u2026 it is virtually impossible to accurately assess the customary status of almost any norm \ngiven the number of States, the myriad forms of State practice, the existence of language \nbarriers, and disputes about what counts as State practice and opinio juris. The result is that \nmany actors, including international courts, routinely assert the existence of custom based on a \nhandful of examples of State practice, with contrary practice being discounted as a breach and \nthe absence of other practice being explained through concepts such as acquiescence. \n\u2018\u2026 \n\u2018If a comparative survey produces cases that the decision maker likes, the temptation will be to \ncharacterize these judgments as impartial evidence of the existence or meaning of international \nlaw. If the survey produces cases that the decision maker dislikes, these decisions are likely to \nbe discounted as unpersuasive on the basis that they reflect the practice of only a few States.\u2019 \n\n \n76 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 70) [4].  \n77 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (20 May 2011) ILDC 1815 (Italian Court of \nCassation).  \n78 Judgment No 238/2014 (22 October 2014) \n<http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/actionSchedaPronuncia.do?anno=2014&amp;numero=238> accessed 26 \nNovember 2015 (Italian Court of Cassation).

Instead of acknowledging the existence of a conflict between \n\nexisting customary international law norms which had to be solved by coordinating and \n\nbalancing them, they sought to find whether state practice supported or not the removal of \n\nimmunity in cases of gross violations of human rights. This approach effectively killed any \n\npossibility of adding this further restriction to state immunity and perpetuated the \n\naforementioned \u2018customary international legal feedback loop\u2019. There was also a lack of \n\nnuance in this formalist exercise. Most courts merely took note of legislations and of the \n\noutcomes of judicial decisions of other states, without evaluating context. The ICJ, for \n\ninstance, did not properly take into consideration that the courts of most common law \n\ncountries, having statutes codifying rules relating to state immunity, did not rely directly \n\non international law to reach their conclusions.  \n\nThe criticisms directed at the Italian Court of Cassation reveal the adoption of a \n\nmanifestly voluntarist model of international legal rationality. As seen in chapter 3, Lord \n\nHoffmann argued that the technique of balancing interests, which had been employed by \n\nthe Italian Court of Cassation, could not be adopted in international law because that would \n\nmean unilaterally developing it, and that, according to him, would run counter to \u2018the \n\ncommon consent of nations\u2019, upon which international law is founded.80 Similarly, the ICJ \n\nasserted that state immunity, being a right of the foreign state, could not \u2018\u2026 be made \n\ndependent upon the outcome of a balancing exercise of the specific circumstances of each \n\ncase to be conducted by the national court before which immunity is claimed.\u201981  \n\n                                                \n79 Judgment No 238/2014 (n 78): \n \n\n\u2018Ad essa [Corte] spetta in via esclusiva il compito di assicurare il rispetto della Costituzione ed \na maggior ragione dei suoi principi fondamentali e quindi la necessaria valutazione della \ncompatibilit\u00e0 della norma internazionale sull\u2019immunit\u00e0 degli Stati dalla giurisdizione civile \ndegli altri Stati con i predetti principi, con l\u2019effetto di produrre un ulteriore ridimensionamento \ndella portata della predetta norma, limitato al diritto interno ma tale da concorrere, altres\u00ec, ad \nun\u2019auspicabile e da pi\u00f9 parti auspicata evoluzione dello stesso diritto internazionale.\u2019 \n\n \n80 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another; Mitchell and others v Al-Dali \nand others [2007] 129 ILR 713 (House of Lords), 738-739. \n81 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Merits: Judgment) [2012] \nICJ Rep 99, [101]. \n\n\n\n212  \n\n Upon the analysis of the various cases, it is clear that the methodology adopted by \n\nthe courts for the ascertainment of customary international law, which created and \n\nperpetuated a loop, contributed to what Higgins called \u2018the disturbing ethical dilemma \n\npresented by the law of State immunity\u201982.  \n\nTo my knowledge, thus far, the Italian courts were the only domestic courts to react \n\nto the judgment of the ICJ. In the Jones case, the ECtHR confirmed its previous case-law \n\nand relied on the judgment of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State to do so. \n\nThe ECtHR mentioned it considered the ICJ\u2019s judgment \u2018authoritative as regards the \n\ncontent of customary international law\u2019.83 The ECtHR thus concluded no jus cogens \n\nexception to state immunity had crystallized.  As Judge Can\u00e7ado Trindade anticipated, it \n\nseems that the ICJ\u2019s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of State indeed has contributed \n\nto the stagnation of the law of state immunity.  \n\n \n\n5.2.3 A victory for formalism?  \n\n  \n\nAs regards the relationship between state immunity and human rights, the cases \n\nstudied showed the prevalence of formalism, of sovereign equality as the principle \n\ngoverning the outcome of the judicial decisions, and of a voluntarist rationality in the \n\nascertainment of customary international law.   \n\nLorna McGregor captured how the use of the language of international law deflects \n\nattention from the real underlying problems and argued that the neutrality of state \n\nimmunity is a myth: \n\n \n\u2018The formal division between procedural and substantive norms as parallel but distinct regimes \n\nprovides plausible legal language to justify the provision of immunity without directly rejecting \n\nthe prohibition of torture. In the same sentence, states and judicial bodies can reaffirm their \n\ncommitment to the prohibition of torture and claim, through the neutralizing rhetoric of the law \n\nof procedure, that immunity sits compatibly with the prohibition of torture by not interacting \n\nwith it at all. Equally, however, attempts to deny the impact of other procedural rules on the \n\nprohibition of torture have been exposed and rejected.  \n\n                                                \n82  Higgins (n 63) 142. Interestingly, when analyzing the availability of state immunity in cases of \nperpetration of heinous international crimes and of violations of jus cogens norms, Higgins considered that \n\u2018\u2026 the arguments of logic do not in fact seem to be insurmountable: it is really the will of States to develop \nthe law, rather than principles of logic, which is pro tem the insurmountable hurdle.\u2019 See Higgins (n 63) 141. \n83 Jones and others v United Kingdom [Fourth Section] (Application Nos 34356/06 and 40528/06) (Merits: \nJudgment) (2014)&lt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-140005> accessed 26 November 2015, [198]. \n\n\n\n213  \n\n\u2018\u2026 By framing immunity as a procedural rule, the pretence of neutrality acts to steer attention \n\naway from the deeper question of the legitimacy of immunity when torture is alleged \u2026 [T]he \n\nfocus on procedure sanitizes immunity, thus legitimizing and denying the impact of immunity on \n\nimpunity \u2026 Once the mythology of the neutrality of immunity is exposed, immunity no longer \n\npresents itself as simply a procedural rule, but a barrier tantamount to the acceptance of torture; \n\nan acceptance which cannot co-exist with rejection of its prohibition. As such, procedural rules \n\ncannot be used to evade substantive obligations, as this would defeat the core basis for jus \n\ncogens norms such as the prohibition of torture, by facilitating unlawful derogation.\u201984 \n\n  \n\nIn the same vein, Lorna McGregor also pointed out that the rhetoric of immunity is \n\nbased on an idea about the scope of sovereignty that simply does not correspond to its \n\ncurrent status\u2014in her words, there has been a \u2018disjuncture\u2019 between sovereignty and \n\nimmunity: \n\n \n\u2018If immunity derives from sovereignty, its meaning, extent, and impact must also be contingent \n\non the current scope of sovereignty. Yet, by simply restating the origins of immunity in \n\nsovereignty, courts have failed to acknowledge the restrictions on the scope of immunity caused \n\nby the evolution of sovereignty over time. As such, judicial decisions in which a state pleads \n\nimmunity against allegations of torture result in an inevitable clash between the principles of \n\n1648 and those of today. To tie immunity to the 1648 meaning of sovereignty positions the \n\nsovereign above the law. As a consequence, immunity renders the prohibition of torture impotent \n\nand also frees sovereignty from its own constitutive framework in international law. As with the \n\ndivision between procedural and substantive rules, the masked reliance on a Westphalian \n\nsovereignty would accord states the effective freedom to avoid accountability for a crime such as \n\ntorture, while advancing a rhetorical commitment to its prohibition. \n\n\u2018\u2026 [B]y simply referring to sovereignty as if amorphous, abstract, and temporally detached, a \n\nWestphalian sovereignty is injected, enabling states to stand outside the law while framing the \n\ndecision within the confines of the law.\u201985 \n\n \n\n                                                \n84 Lorna McGregor, \u2018Torture and State Immunity: Deflecting Impunity, Distorting Sovereignty\u2019 (2008) 18(5) \nEJIL 903, 911 (footnotes omitted). As remarked by Roberts, who referred specifically to the application of \ninternational law by domestic courts, the rhetoric of neutrality employed by courts can disguise attempts of \nprogressive development as well as justify inaction. See Roberts (n 64) 71-72: \n \n\n\u2018In some cases, national courts embrace the vision of themselves as impartial law enforcers as \na cloak to disguise their progressive development of the law. In others, domestic courts cling to \nthis role as a shield to justify inaction and deflect criticism for not developing the law. In this \nway, the mantra of impartial law enforcement may serve to obscure the real actions or \nmotivations of domestic courts.\u2019 \n \n\n85 McGregor (n 84) 916-918 (footnotes omitted). \n\n\n\n214  \n\nNevertheless, these rhetorical strategies\u2014a rigorous formalism, as seen in the stark \n\ndivision between procedural and substantive norms, the employment of an amorphous and \n\nhazy concept of sovereignty, and, it might be added, a quantitative methodology for the \n\nascertainment of customary international law\u2014have been successful, as demonstrated by \n\nthe \u2018customary international legal feedback loop\u2019, which was picked up by the ICJ.  \n\nAs pointed out by Andrea Bianchi, the judgment delivered by the ICJ was \n\n\u2018perfectly attuned\u2019 to its audience, namely states, or, more specifically, individuals who \u2018in \n\ntheir professional capacity depend heavily on the inter-state system.\u201986 Bianchi\u2019s analysis \n\nis grounded on the perspective of the relationship between the speaker (ie, the Court) and \n\nthe audience (ie, states). This framework of analysis clarifies why the ICJ\u2019s ruling was \n\nrhetorically effective. The adoption of alternative views by the ICJ might have been not \n\nonly unsuitable for the audience, but also might have put at risk the legitimacy of the \n\nCourt. In a commentary to the dissenting opinions attached to the ICJ\u2019s judgment \n\n(particularly that of Judge Can\u00e7ado Trindade), Bianchi highlighted the following: \n\n \n\u2018To adopt, as normative background, the protection of individuals and, therefore, the \n\nfundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law will not make inroads on the views \n\nof those who look at the state as the main hinge upon which the whole international legal system \n\nrevolves. It would be na\u00efve to think that this way of thinking may be adopted by judges whose \n\noverwhelming majority acted in their prior professional experience as state\u2019s or international \n\norganization\u2019s advisers. \n\n\u2018\u2026 To appeal to values other than those traditionally upheld in the state-centred view of \n\ninternational law\u2014the principle of sovereign equality being a good case in point!\u2014can be \n\ncounter-productive in a context such as that of the ICJ. \n\n\u2018\u2026 The passion and the sense of commitment to such a noble (and yet value-laden in the \n\nperception of the traditional approach to international law!) cause as the protection of human \n\nrights are not favourably received in an intellectual and professional milieu, which is more \n\ninclined to give weight to apparently value-free and objective standards such as the rules that \n\nthey themselves are supposed to find in international law and that\u2014what a coincidence!\u2014tend \n\nto provide support to the current status quo and power structures of the international legal \n\nsystem.\u201987 \n\n \n\n It may be added that, in this case, the position adopted by the ICJ was also \n\nlegitimized by the previous rulings of the domestic courts, which acted mostly as \n\n                                                \n86 Bianchi (n 61) 467-468. \n87 ibid 472 (footnotes omitted). \n\n\n\n215  \n\n\u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018impartial\u2019 enforcers of international law. 88  Deflection from the norm \n\naccording to which immunity should be granted even in claims arising out of gross \n\nviolations of human rights will be even more difficult after the judgment of the ICJ.  \n\nIn an article written before the ICJ\u2019s judgment, Roger O\u2019Keefe asserted there was \n\nno \u2018knock-down argument\u2019 which could be marshaled in support of the circumvention of \n\nstate immunity in human rights cases. 89  Within the current prevailing state-centered \n\noutlook of international law, that is indeed the case. Furthermore, the authority attached to \n\nrulings of the ICJ\u2014in the expression of Jennings, there is the tendency of courts and \n\nwriters \u2018\u2026 to cite isolated passages from judgments, almost as if they were passages from \n\nHoly Writ\u201990\u2014is an almost insurmountable obstacle to the success of a future generalized \n\nacceptance of a restriction to state immunity in respect of violations of human rights. The \n\nstrategy adopted by the Italian Court of Cassation in Judgment No 238/2014 is very telling \n\nin this respect. Although the Court of Cassation criticized the ruling of the ICJ, it conceded \n\nthat it was an authoritative pronouncement in matters of customary international law. The \n\nonly way out was to adopt a dualistic position and declare that the customary international \n\nnorm ascertained by the ICJ did not produce a domestic norm with the same content due to \n\nits incompatibility with the Italian Constitution. Thus far, the Italian Court of Cassation is \n\nisolated in its approach, but we ought to be careful not to rush to the conclusion that the \n\nICJ\u2019s judgment will settle the discussion. As pointed out by Bianchi: \n\n \n\u2018It is certainly true that the judgment in the Jurisdictional Immunities of the State case is a very \n\ngood example of rhetorical efficacy and of the capacity of a judicial body to be attuned to its \n\nown audience. Having said that, one needs to notice that the blatant denial of any legal remedy to \n\nvictims of serious human rights violations strikes a chord with transnational civil society that no \n\ntechnical reasoning or justification based on jurisdictional immunities can effectively counter. \n\nThe idea that the privilege of immunity may shield a state just because of its status is unlikely to \n\nbe well received by those who are unfamiliar with the law. It may then be argued that this is \n\nprecisely the reason for which the law exists. My hunch, however, is that once the law becomes \n\ntoo disconnected from the societal body from which it emanates, its credibility is at risk.  \n\n\u2018History shows that this is an area of law in which the activism of domestic courts has always led \n\nthe way, one way or the other. Even though the constraints currently posed by domestic and \n\ninternational judicial precedents, let alone multilateral treaties, seem to be an insurmountable \n\n                                                \n88 See Roberts (n 64) 64-73 and 80-81; Alebeek (n 64) 573-574. \n89 O\u2019Keefe (n 62) 1025. \n90 Robert Y. Jennings, \u2018The Role of the International Court of Justice\u2019 (1998) 68(1) BYIL 1, 41. Bianchi also \nreferred to this passage from Jennings in his article. See Bianchi (n 61) 463. \n\n\n\n216  \n\nobstacle to denying state immunity to violators of human rights, one should be cautious before \n\nconcluding that what the ICJ held is the last word on the matter.\u201991 \n\n \n\nAlthough the current consensus is biased towards privileging a formalist, \n\nquantitative approach to the ascertainment of custom over a qualitative one, states\u2019 rights \n\nover human rights, and the maintenance of an alleged stability of international relations to \n\nthe detriment of the right to reparation of victims of gross violations of human rights, it is \n\nimportant to highlight it is always possible to contest the current structural biases. And this \n\ncontestation, as Koskenniemi argued, can be carried out through the language of \n\ninternational law.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Prospects \n\n \n\n From a geological perspective, the accretion and thickening of the layers relating to \n\nthe protection of human rights generated pressures on the law of state immunity, which is \n\nlocated in lower layers of international law.92 Nevertheless, these pressures were not \n\nenough to give rise to a generalized acceptance of further restrictions to the scope of state \n\nimmunity. The decisions of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State and of the \n\nECtHR in Jones make it more difficult and unlikely for changes to occur in this regard. At \n\nthe same time, and as noted by Andrea Bianchi, there may be a risk that the law is \n\nbecoming \u2018too disconnected from the societal body from which it emanates\u2019 and it might \n\nbe the case that the ICJ did not pronounce the last words on the matter. Domestic courts \n\nmay still have the opportunity to develop renewed assessments of the relationship between \n\nstate immunity and the human rights.93 \n\n As considered previously, the ICJ asserted that a state\u2019s right to immunity could not \n\nbe made dependent upon a balancing exercise to be conducted by a national court and that \n\nchanges in the scope of state immunity could only be made by changes in state practice, \n\n                                                \n91 Bianchi (n 61) 474 (footnotes omitted). \n92 See Joseph Weiler, \u2018The Geology of International Law \u2013 Governance, Democracy and Legitimacy\u2019 (2004) \n64 Za\u00f6RV 548 and Christian Djeffal, \u2018Constitutional paths not taken: Germany vs. Italy before the ICJ\u2019 \n<http://verfassungsblog.de/constitutional-paths-germany-italy-icj/> accessed 29 April 2016. \n93 See Alebeek (n 64) 574-578. In Alebeek\u2019s understanding, \u2018\u2026 domestic courts are, as a matter of \ninternational law, bound by both primary and secondary rules of international law when applying \ninternational immunity rules.\u2019 She ponders that, even within these strict limits, \u2018\u2026 the particular sensitivity \nof domestic courts to the right of individuals makes them an obvious candidate for the much-called-for \nreconsideration of both the ECtHR and the ICJ perspectives on the relationship between immunity rules and \nthe right of access to court.\u2019  \n\n\n\n217  \n\nwhilst the ECtHR concluded that the individual\u2019s right of access to court could be limited \n\nby state immunity because such a limitation pursues a legitimate aim (the promotion of \n\ngood relations between states) and is proportionate (because it is a measure which reflects \n\na generally recognized rule of public international law). The Italian Court of Cassation, on \n\nthe other hand, employed techniques typical of modern constitutionalism, resorting to \n\ngeneral principles, to the concept of normative hierarchy, and to balancing and \n\nproportionality. 94 This comparison may indicate that domestic courts are in a better \n\nposition to strike a balance between state immunity and human rights in order not to \n\ndisregard the rights of individuals.95 Furthermore, an international court such as the ICJ \n\nmay feel that it is at risk of undermining its legitimacy vis-\u00e0-vis its \u2018clients\u2019 (ie, states) by \n\nresorting to hermeneutical techniques like the ones employed by the Italian Court of \n\nCassation. Only the future will tell whether the current consensus will be questioned and \n\nrevisited by domestic courts.  \n\n There have been proposals for an optional protocol to the UNCJISP providing for \n\nthe abrogation of immunity in civil claims based on serious violations of human rights, but, \n\nas put by Roger O\u2019Keefe, \u2018the idea is a pie in the sky\u201996, since most states are content with \n\nthe status quo. Furthermore, as pointed out by him, states most likely to appear as \n\ndefendants in proceedings of this kind would probably not ratify the proposed protocol.97    \n\nO\u2019Keefe also highlighted that there would be obstacles even if jurisdictional \n\nimmunity were abrogated. Immunity from execution, \u2018the last bastion of State \n\nimmunity\u201998, is governed by different rules and it would still remain even in the case in \n\nwhich a victim of a serious violation of human rights obtained a favorable judicial \n\ndecision. O\u2019Keefe contends that the strategy of targeting the forum state\u2019s courts for the \n\nfailure of providing a remedy for the victims of serious violations of human rights due to \n\nthe grant of state immunity is misdirected both in terms of fairness and in terms of ultimate \n\npolicy objectives.99 In his view, this strategy is misdirected in terms of fairness because the \n\n\u2018chief villain\u2019 is the state responsible for the violations of international human rights law \n\n                                                \n94  See Massimo Iovane, \u2018Domestic Courts Should Embrace Sound Interpretative Strategies in the \nDevelopment of Human Rights-Oriented International Law\u2019 in Antonio Cassese (ed) Realizing Utopia: The \nFuture of International Law (OUP 2012).  \n95 See also Alebeek (n 64) 574-577. \n96 O\u2019Keefe (n 62) 1034. \n97 ibid 1035. \n98 ILC, \u2018Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, with commentaries\u2019 in \n\u2018Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-third session\u2019 (29 April-19 July 1991) \nUN Doc A/46/10 (1991) II(2) YILC 13-62, 56. \n99 O\u2019Keefe (n 62) 1037-1040. \n\n\n\n218  \n\nand international humanitarian law and which denies redress for the victims. 100 \n\nAccordingly, the state of the victim\u2019s nationality is also to be blamed inasmuch as it fails to \n\nexercise diplomatic protection in order to secure redress.101 As regards policy objectives, \n\nO\u2019Keefe argues that the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign states in human rights cases \n\ndoes not solve the ultimate problem of the civil impunity of states which violate \n\ninternational human rights law and international humanitarian law and it also exempts \n\nstates from defending the rights of its nationals who were victims of such violations \n\ncommitted by other states\u2014it is, in his expression, \u2018a band-aid solution to the problem of \n\ncivil impunity for violations of international rules on the humane treatment of \n\nindividuals\u2019.102  His suggestion is therefore to shift the focus to the state which caused \n\ndeath or personal injury in breach of international law and to the state of the victim\u2019s \n\nnationality.103  \n\nIt is doubtful, however, whether mobilizing the shame of states would be a more \n\nsuccessful strategy than litigation. Pressuring the state of the victim\u2019s nationality for a \n\nmore active stance as regards diplomatic protection is unlikely to yield the desired results. \n\nDiplomatic protection is exercised by the state in its own right and has a discretionary \n\nnature. As Lorna McGregor highlighted, diplomatic protection, from the victim\u2019s \n\nperspective, is not a \u2018controllable and predictable\u2019 mechanism through which a claim can \n\nbe made.104 In any case, these strategies are not mutually exclusive. \n\n \n\n5.4 Concluding remarks \n\n \n\n As underscored in the beginning of this chapter, Koskenniemi\u2019s treatment of \n\ninternational law as a language accounts for two remarkable characteristics of international \n\nlegal argumentation: its \u2018rigorous formalism\u2019 and its \u2018substantive open-endedness\u2019. This \n\nmeans that current hegemonic views are always open to contestation, provided that this is \n\ndone through the patterns of argumentation accepted by the \u2018invisible college of \n\ninternational lawyers\u2019. As regards the relationship between state immunity and human \n\nrights, the current hegemonic professional consensus privileges a rigorous formalism, as \n\nexpressed in the rigid dichotomy between procedural and substantive norms and in a \n\n                                                \n100 O\u2019Keefe (n 62) 1037-1039. \n101 ibid. \n102 ibid 1039-140. \n103 ibid. \n104 McGregor (n 84) 908-911. \n\n\n\n219  \n\nquantitative methodology for the ascertainment of customary international law. There is \n\nalso a widespread use of an amorphous, hazy concept of sovereignty in order to justify the \n\nprimacy of state immunity over the rights of individuals. Appeals to the necessity of \n\nmaintaining the stability of international relations are also employed in order to rationalize \n\nthe sacrifice of the individual\u2019s right to compensation arising from serious violations of \n\ninternational human rights law and international humanitarian law.  \n\n The decisions of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of States and of the ECtHR in \n\nJones may have crystallized this consensus. As remarked before, it is the case that, in \n\ninternational law, the distinction between deviance and law-creation is not always clear. \n\nNevertheless, in the light of the authority attached to these pronouncements, deflection \n\nfrom the norm according to which immunity should be granted even in claims arising out \n\nof gross violations of human rights will more likely be considered law-breaking rather than \n\nlaw-development or even law-making. \n\n Contestation always remains a possibility. As David Kennedy observed, \u2018\u2026 the \n\npatterns of repetitions, associations and references which characterise public international \n\nlaw seems suited to a practice of interminable discourse\u2019, and \u2018[t]he interminability of \n\ninternational law seems the subtle secret of its success.\u2019105 It may be the case that the \n\nbalance struck between state immunity and human rights, regarded by many as \n\nunsatisfactory, will be reassessed in the future.  \n\n \n\n                                                \n105 David Kennedy, International Legal Structures (Nomos 1987) 294. \n \n\n\n\n220  \n\n6 \u2014 GENERAL CONCLUSION \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2018Why is it that concepts and structures that are themselves indeterminate nonetheless still \n\nend up always on the side of the status quo?\u2019 \n\n \n\nMartti Koskenniemi, From Apology to Utopia: The Structure of International Legal \n\nArgument (CUP 2005) 606 \n\n \n\n\u2018International law might better be viewed as an area of contestation between different \n\nvisions of international law articulated by many different actors, including domestic \n\ncourts.\u2019 \n\n \n\nAnthea Roberts, \u2018Comparative International Law?

Although state \n\nimmunity prevents the realization of justice for the victims of serious violations of \n\ninternational law, it still exerts a compliance pull\u2014something that may be explained by its \n\nsymbolic validation, to use Franck\u2019s expression.3 State immunity has been associated by \n\nmost courts with the principle of sovereign equality, expressed in the maxim par in parem \n\nnon habet imperium and which is widely recognized as one of the cornerstones of \n\ninternational law.  \n\nWithin the current predominant state-centered outlook of international law, in \n\ngeneral terms, arguments supporting the contention according to which a state is not \n\nentitled to immunity for acts that violate human rights and jus cogens norms have not been \n\nsuccessful. There have been, of course, voices that strongly disagreed with this hegemonic \n\nperspective. And they expressed this disagreement coming from different premises. It can \n\nbe mentioned here Can\u00e7ado Trindade\u2019s dissenting opinion appended to the judgment of the \n\nICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, in which it was proposed that the state-centric \n\napproach to international law should give place to fundamental human values. The Italian \n\nCourt of Cassation resorted to techniques of adjudication usually associated with modern \n\nconstitutionalism, such as general principles, the concept of normative hierarchy, and \n\nbalancing and proportionality. 4  In a stark contrast, the idea that the state\u2019s right to \n\nimmunity could be balanced with other competing interests was frowned upon both in the \n\nHouse of Lords and in the ICJ. The judgments of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of \n\nthe State and of the ECtHR in Jones have not, however, settled the debate, as demonstrated \n\nby the Italian Court of Cassation in Judgment No 238/2014.   \n\nThe legal discussions on the relationship between state immunity and human rights \n\noften hide and deflect attention from the real underlying problem, namely that of impunity. \n\nAfter all, civil claims arising from serious violations of human rights are brought against \n\nforeign states mostly due to the impossibility of obtaining a remedy otherwise.  \n\n                                                \n3 Thomas Franck, Fairness in International Law and Institutions (OUP 1998) 34: \u2018Symbolic validation \ncommunicates authority. \u2026 A rule is symbolically validated when it has attributes, often in the form of cues, \nwhich signal its significant part in the overall system of social order.\u2019 \n4  See Massimo Iovane, \u2018Domestic Courts Should Embrace Sound Interpretative Strategies in the \nDevelopment of Human Rights-Oriented International Law\u2019 in Antonio Cassese (ed) Realizing Utopia: The \nFuture of International Law (OUP 2012). \n\n\n\n222  \n\nLady Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb emphasized that \u2018[t]he law of State immunity \n\nis not static.\u20195 It is unlikely, but it may be the case that the situation will eventually reach a \n\npoint in which transformative action 6  will be felt needed\u2014and, through the general \n\nacceptance by courts and states, changes in the consensus about the law of state immunity \n\nmay take place. International law can change quickly, even in issues that once were \n\nconsidered extremely contentious.7 And it might also be the case that transformative action \n\nwill assume other forms unrelated to the exercise by domestic courts of jurisdiction over \n\nforeign states in human rights cases. \n\nAt the moment, the hegemonic consensus is on the side of the maintenance of the \n\nstatus quo.
