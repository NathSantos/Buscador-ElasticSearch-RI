The Araneidae is a speciose family including web-spinning spiders that are very abundant in various terrestrial ecosystems. Several \nstudies demonstrate that changes in vegetation surrounding rivers, streams and brooks affect the associated araneofauna. The aim of this research \nwas to compare differences found in diversity (abundance and richness), composition and phenology of Araneidae spiders sampled in different \nhabitats in four riparian forest catchments in southern Brazil. Samples were taken from riparian forests in four rivers of Rio Grande do Sul State: \nPiratini, Camaqu\u00e3, Sinos and Maquin\u00e9 rivers, each in a different hydrographic basin. Samples were taken twice seasonally on each basin during two \nyears, sampling the araneofauna of the tree-shrub strata with beating tray. Six transects were employed on each basin, two per habitat: edge with \ngrassland, forest interior and river edge. Araneids totalled 20 genera and 65 species. Comparing riparian forests significant differences are found. \nSpider abundance differed among riparian forests as well as species richness. Overall, Piratini river riparian forest had the higher abundance and \nrichness for Araneidae; the lower values were in Sinos river forest. The stronger degradation and fragmentation of the riparian forests of Sinos river \nprobably influenced the results, with human disturbance gradients associated negatively to web building. We present data on the diversity of these \nspiders, which were very abundant in the riparian forest interior and very rich in species in the grassland/riparian forest edge. Species composition \nalso differs among the studied habitats (the above plus river/riparian forest edge). For the most abundant species the phenological pattern across \nthe seasons was also analysed.\n\nKEYWORDS. Spiders, habitats, Rio Grande do Sul, abundance, richness.\n\nRESUMO. Diversidade, composi\u00e7\u00e3o e fenologia de aranhas construtoras de teias (Araneae, Araneidae) associadas com matas ciliares no sul \ndo Brasil. Araneidae \u00e9 uma das fam\u00edlias com maior n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies, incluindo aranhas construtoras de teias que s\u00e3o muito abundantes em diversos \necossistemas terrestres. V\u00e1rios estudos demonstram que mudan\u00e7as na vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o circundante de rios, c\u00f3rregos e riachos pode afetar a araneofauna \nassociada. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar aspectos sobre a diversidade (abund\u00e2ncia e riqueza), composi\u00e7\u00e3o e fenologia de aranhas Araneidae \nforam amostradas em diferentes habitats em quatro bacias de mata ciliar no sul do Brasil. Foram coletadas amostras de matas ciliares em quatro rios \ndo Rio Grande do Sul, todos em diferentes bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas: nos rios Piratini, Camaqu\u00e3, dos Sinos e Maquin\u00e9. As amostras foram realizadas \nduas vezes por esta\u00e7\u00e3o em cada bacia, durante dois anos, a amostragem da araneofauna do estrato arb\u00f3reo-arbustivo foi realizada com guarda-\nchuva entomol\u00f3gico. Seis transec\u00e7\u00f5es foram empregadas em cada mata ciliar, dois por habitat: borda com campo, interior da floresta e borda do rio. \nArane\u00eddeos totalizaram 20 g\u00eaneros e 65 esp\u00e9cies. Comparando-se as matas ciliares houve diferen\u00e7as significativas. A abund\u00e2ncia de aranhas diferiu \nentre as matas ciliares, bem como a riqueza de esp\u00e9cies. No geral, a mata ciliar do rio Piratini teve a maior abund\u00e2ncia e riqueza para Araneidae; os \nmenores valores foram no rio dos Sinos. A degrada\u00e7\u00e3o e fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o da mata ciliar do rio dos Sinos, provavelmente influenciaram nos resultados, \na partir da perturba\u00e7\u00e3o humana agindo de forma negativa nas aranhas da fam\u00edlia Araneidae. Apresentamos dados sobre a diversidade destas aranhas, \nque foram muito abundantes no interior da mata ciliar e muito ricas em esp\u00e9cies na borda da mata com o campo. A composi\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies tamb\u00e9m \ndifere entre os habitats estudados. Para as esp\u00e9cies mais abundantes, o padr\u00e3o fenol\u00f3gico em todas as esta\u00e7\u00f5es do ano tamb\u00e9m foi analisado.\n\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE. Aranhas, habitats, Rio Grande do Sul, abund\u00e2ncia, riqueza.\n\nRiparian forests are key elements in the landscape, \nbeing one of the few to remain, although quite altered, \nafter agroecosystem \u201cdevelopment\u201d in many different \nenvironments. Riparian forests have an important function \nas corridors, potentially helping araneofauna dispersal \nbetween distant areas (RaizeR et al., 2005). Nevertheless, \nthe spider fauna of this ecosystem remains poorly known, \nand few inventories and ecological researches have been \ndeveloped there (for an exception, see RodRigues &amp; \nMendon\u00e7a, 2012; RodRigues et al., 2014).\n\nRiparian forests are good corridors also because they \nare usually relatively narrow strips accompanying rivers \n(HaRpeR et al., 2007), and have been further reduced in \ntheir extension by human impacts. Thus, they are especially \namenable to edge effects (MuRcia, 1995), and this could \nimpact the spider fauna in different ways. For example, \n\npioneer plants occupying edges, along with changed abiotic \nfactors, could help augment insect herbivore activity \non forest edges, which could positively impact spiders \n(WiRtH et al., 2008). On the other hand, plant structure \n(RodRigues et al., 2014) and species richness (BaldisseRa \net al., 2004) is essential to web building spiders and thus \nwould generate an expectation for more abundant and \nricher spider assemblages on the forest interior.\n\nThe family Araneidae is the third in number of \ngenera and species globally (WoRld spideR catalog, 2015), \nincluding ecribellate, entelegyne, three-clawed spiders, \nhaving eight eyes in two rows. They are also notable for \nbuilding orb webs (levi, 2002), which renders them easy to \nsample since they can be viewed and collected from webs, \nand puts them into a single functional hunting guild among \nspiders. They have a relatively large size and are colourful, \n\nDOI: 10.1590/1678-4766201510515361\nIheringia, S\u00e9rie Zoologia\n\n\n\nRodRigues et al.54\n\ndiagrama\u00e7\u00e3o: letra1@editoraletra1.com\n\nIheringia, S\u00e9rie Zoologia, Porto Alegre, 105(1):53-61, 31 de mar\u00e7o de 2015\n\nbeing thus interesting ecologically and evolutionarily in \nterms of the value associated to these colours. They are \nquite well known taxonomically in the Holartic Region, and \nnot surprisingly the Neotropical araneids are still largely \nundescribed and unknown.\n\nSpiders in this family are generally among the most \nabundant and speciose of those sampled from the tree-\nshrub plant strata in faunal inventories in southern Brazil, \neven from distinct ecosystems (indRusiak &amp; kotzian, \n1998; BaldisseRa et al., 2004; RodRigues, 2005; silva \n&amp; aRaujo, 2005; Bonaldo et al., 2007; podgaiski et al., \n2007; BaldisseRa et al., 2008; RodRigues et al., 2014). A \nspecies list was presented by indRusiak &amp; Buss (2003) for \nthe central region of Rio Grande do Sul State, and in the \nlist of spiders species of Rio Grande do Sul State (Buckup \net al., 2010) cite Araneidae as the family with the highest \nnumber of species to the State (210  species).\n\nAraneidae is one of the few spider families of the \nNeotropical Region with a relatively well-known taxonomy. \nThe available lists already paint a general picture of this \nfauna in the region, allowing comparisons not available \nfor other spiders and even for other invertebrate groups. \nHowever, few species have ecological patterns known, \nsuch as occurrences and abundance in distinct habitats, \nphenology and so forth, Thus, the aim of this study was \nto evaluate aspects of diversity (abundance and richness), \ncomposition and phenology of Araneidae spiders species \nsampled from different habitats in four riparian forest \ncatchments in southern Brazil. How environmental \ndifferences influence araneid spiders was also evaluated. \nOur expectations are that different araneid spider abundance \nand richness will be found on rivers to the north, within \nthe Atlantic forest biome, given simply the latitudinal \ndifferences between this and the Pampa biome, to the \nsouth. Under the biological edge hypothesis, river edges \nand grassland/pasture edges are expected to differ in their \neffect on araneid spider diversity and different composition, \ngiven the distinct nature of these edges.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSamples were taken from riparian forests in four \nrivers of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, each in a different \nhydrographic basin. \n\nIn Piratini river sampling points were in the \nlower course, Arroio Grande municipality, southern \npart of the Coastal Plain macroregion (31\u00b054\u201906.47\u201dS; \n52\u00b039\u201908.29\u201dW). The sampled sector is approximately \n14 m a.s.l. and is 39 km long in the fluvial valley, with a \nforest area of 4,000 ha, representing the largest continuous \nnative riparian forest segment still extant in the southern \nhalf of the Coastal Plain.\n\nIn Camaqu\u00e3 river the left margin of the lower \ncourse was chosen, in Cristal municipality (31\u00b001\u201901.7\u201dS; \n51\u00b056\u201942.0\u201dW), centre-south part of the Coastal Plain. It is \nalso approximately 14 m a.s.l. This area is well preserved, \nwith continuous forest over the plains. This place is affected \n\nby natural intermittent flooding with few indications of \nanthropic disturbance.\n\nThe riparian forest of Sinos river is in Parob\u00e9 \nmunicipality on the right river margin (29\u00b041\u201906.94\u201dS; \n50\u00b051\u201905.98\u201dW), between 6\u201310 m a.s.l. The forest is not \ncontinuous, with fragmentation along the river, but the \nchosen sampling sector includes a fraction of forest still \nin good condition. The forest on the right margin is taller, \nbut with flooding plains, swamps and pastures nearby. \nOn the other margin the forest was partially cut and the \nlocal people use the area for sunbathing and swimming \n(daniel, 1991).\n\nThe sampled sector of the riparian forest along \nMaquin\u00e9 river is also reduced to a fragment, in Maquin\u00e9 \nmunicipality (29\u00b040\u201947.99\u201dS; 50\u00b011\u201920.03\u201dW). With \nan approximate area of 622 km2, it is an enclave in the \nslopes of the highlands. This region is in the Atlantic Forest \nBiosphere Reserve as recognised by UNESCO, included \nin the Serra Geral Biological Reserve. It is considered of \nextreme importance to the conservation of the Brazilian \nAtlantic forest (conseRvation inteRnational do BRasil et \nal., 2000), because of its biodiversity and risk of anthropic \nchange.\n\nField trips occurred during two years (01.\nAugust.2007-06.June.2009), with two sampling dates per \nseason (spring, summer, autumn, winter) on each river, \ntotalling eight samples per year, and 64 samples overall. \nSix transects (approximately 30 m each) were set up in \neach river basin. Therefore, there were two transects per \nhabitat per area. Each transect was a straight line 4 m wide. \nThree habitats were contemplated: the forest-river edge (as \nclose to the border between forest and river as possible, \nRE); the forest interior (FI) and the forest-grassland edge \n(along the border between forest and adjacent vegetation, \nusually grassland but occasionally fallow land close to \nagriculture areas, GE). Spiders on the shrub-tree strata \nwere collected with a beating tray (70 cm x 70 cm) on \neach transect during 45 min. Overall, 24 transects were \nsampled per field trip across all rivers; 288 h of sampling \nwere completed for the whole period.\n\nSpiders were identified in the Laborat\u00f3rio de \nAracnologia and deposited in the spider collection of \nMuseu de Ci\u00eancias Naturais of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Zoobot\u00e2nica do \nRio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil (curator: R. Ott).\n\nAnalytical species richness estimator Jackknife1 \nwas calculated to verify sampling sufficiency, as suggested \nby toti et al. (2000). For this we used EstimateS 8.0 \n(colWell, 2005) with 500 randomisations. To test for \nconjunct differences in sample species richness and \nabundance among riparian forests (rivers) and habitats \n(edges and forest) a two-way MANOVA (with Pillai\u2019s \nTrace statistic) was employed (calculated with SPSS\u00ae 13.0). \nTo illustrate spider species composition comparisons two \nordinations were plotted (Non-metric MultiDimensional \nScaling \u2013 nMDS), one using a qualitative similarity index \n(Simpson) and another a quantitative one (Bray-Curtis). \nTo test for statistical differences among spider assemblage \n\n\n\nDiversity, composition and phenology of araneid orb-weavers... 55\n\ndiagrama\u00e7\u00e3o: letra1@editoraletra1.com\n\nIheringia, S\u00e9rie Zoologia, Porto Alegre, 105(1):53-61, 31 de mar\u00e7o de 2015\n\ncomposition for the above similarity indexes, we applied \ntwo one-way ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) with \nBonferroni correction, one for each factor (habitat and river) \n(claRke &amp; WaRWick, 1994). Phenograms were built for \nspecies with more than 10 individuals sampled, except for \nEustala (a genus currently being revised, Maria Rita Poeta, \nMCTP, pers. comm.), to illustrate patterns of distribution \nin time across the two years of sampling.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nOf a total 42,057 spiders sampled (adults and \njuveniles) in this riparian forest for Rio Grande do Sul \nState, 5,020 belonged to Araneidae (533 adults and 4,489 \njuveniles), the third most abundant family. More females \n(360) than males (173, sex ratio 1:0.48) were captured. \n\nTwenty genera and 65 species were found (Tab. I), \namong rare species 25 were singletons (more than 38%) \n\nand seven were doubletons (10.8%). Similar work with the \nsame method varied in this percentage of rare species for \nthe family, silva &amp; aRa\u00fajo (2005) found high values (82% \nsingletons), but indRusiak &amp; Buss (1998) found low (8%); \nother work remained between 30-40% (RodRigues, 2005; \nBonaldo et al., 2007; podgaiski et al., 2007).  coddington \net al. (2009), comparing several inventories, estimated for \nspiders an average percentage of 37.2% singletons, very \nclose to what was found here.\n\nThe species richness estimator (Jackknife1) \nreturned 44.1 (+3.32, 95% CI) species for Piratini river \n(70.2% of the spider fauna would have been sampled \nfor that environment); 41 (+4.11) species for Camaqu\u00e3 \nriver (63% sampled); 36.1 (+4.08) species for Sinos river \n(63.7% sampled) and 39.2 (+3.21) species for Maquin\u00e9 river \n(71.3%) sampled. Even after two whole years of sampling, \na high number of species (in RS, the only one below the \nwork by podgaiski et al., 2007) and with new records for \n\nTab. I.

Spider \nabundance differed among riparian forests (MANOVA, F \n= 18.976; p &lt;0.0001, Fig. 1) as well as species richness (F \n= 9.93; p = 0.001, Fig. 2). Overall, Piratini river riparian \nforest had the higher total abundance (N = 1900, Nadults = \n222) and richness (S = 31) for Araneidae; the lower values \nwere in Sinos river forest (N = 749, Nadults = 90; S = 23). \nThe stronger degradation and fragmentation of the riparian \nforests in Sinos river probably influenced the results, with \nhuman disturbance gradients associated negatively to web \nbuilding. There are previous demonstrations that anthropic \nchanges to the environment influence the spider fauna \n(laeseR et al., 2005; Benati et al., 2005).\n\nSix species were common among all riparian \nforests: Araneus omnicolor (Keyserling, 1893), Cyclosa \nmachadinho Levi, 1999, Eustala taquara (Keyserling, \n1892), Mangora strenua (Keyserling, 1893), Micrathena \nguanabara Levi, 1985 and Scoloderus cordatus \n(Taczanowski, 1879). Maquin\u00e9 river forests had the higher \nnumber of exclusive species (11) (Tab. I). Among the \nAraneidae recorded for riparian forests in southern Brazil, \n59 were determined to the species level (91%). Among \nthose, more than 60% were shared with two spider fauna \nlists for Rio Grande do Sul State: indRusiak &amp; Buss (1998), \nin Santa Maria, in the centre of the State, where one of \nthe sites studied was a riparian forest as well, and with \n\nRodRigues (2005) in Cap\u00e3o do Le\u00e3o, south of the State, \nstudying a restinga (sandy soil sclerophyllous) forest. A \ncomparison with Bonaldo et al. (2007), studying various \nenvironments, among them five sites in riparian forests, \nyields 53% similarity for the Araneidae fauna. \n\nComparisons with different ecosystems reveal a \ndistinct Araneidae fauna, podgaiski et al. (2007) studied \nthe araneofauna for the northwestern forests of RS, with \nhigh species richness, but recording only 38,7% of shared \naraneid species with ours. The same is valid for BaldisseRa \net al. (2008) considering mixed broad-leaved/Araucaria \nforests and Pinus plantations, sampling manually from the \ntree-shrub layer, attaining 37% similarity only with our data.\n\nComparing habitats (MANOVA), significant \ndifferences are again found (Pillai\u2019s Trace, value = 0.90; \nF = 4.86; p = 0.005). Among habitats, forest interior had \nthe highest abundance (N = 1,922), followed by grassland \nedge (1,843) and river edge (1,257) spider abundance \ndiffered among habitats (MANOVA, F = 9.90; p = 0.001, \nFig. 3); the same pattern holds for adult spiders only (FI \n= 256; GE = 169; RE = 108). Species richness was higher \nin the grassland edge (GE, richness mean = 10.63; S = \n45), followed by forest interior (FI, richness mean = 9.13; \nS = 30) and river edge (RE, richness mean = 7.13; S = \n25); species richness differed among habitats (F = 7.62; \np = 0.007, Fig. 4). RodRigues (2005) recorded a similar \npattern, with higher Araneidae abundance within the forest \nbut higher species richness in the ecotone, here equivalent \nto the edge. BaldisseRa et al. (2004) recorded higher \nAraneidae abundance in the forest interior, with richness not \ndiffering from the edge.

A higher \nabundance in the forest interior can be a result of a lower \nstress in terms of lower wind speeds and light intensity, \nhowever the higher richness in the edge requires an \nalternative explanation (see RodRigues et al., 2014).\n\nWeb building sites requires not only specific \nmicroclimates, but also space (Foelix, 1996), which in \nthe grassland edge appears nearly unlimited; besides, this \nhabitat had a high number of exclusive species (S = 23) but \na high number of species shared with the forest interior. A \ngradient in abiotic conditions could be responsible for this, \nwith certain species being able to withstand the edge and \noccur in both habitats, but some only finding appropriate \nconditions in the proper edge.\n\nThe forest interior registered 13 exclusive species, \nriver edge had five and ten species were common to all \nhabitats. Most of these species were represented by a few \nindividuals (singletons or doubletons), preventing a proper \nassessment of environment preference.\n\nFaunal similarity, compared among habitats in \nthe riparian forests, recorded significant differences for \nboth indexes used: qualitative (ANOSIM: Simpson, R = \n0.222; p = 0.040) and quantitative (Bray-Curtis, R = 0.274; \np = 0.033). The forest interior is the most distinctive in \nspecies composition, differing from edges both for the \nqualitative (p = 0.02) and the quantitative (p = 0.03) index \n(Figs 5, 6). That is, even with the grassland edge richer in \nspecies, araneid species composition between the edges is \nsimilar, but the forest interiors are distinct. It appears that \nenvironmental factors related to the edge itself are more \nimportant than those related to the nearby habitat or matrix \n(grassland or river).\n\nThe temporal distribution of the Araneidae along \ntwo years shows a clear summer peak in numbers, valid for \nboth sexes. Males appeared more homogeneously across \ntime, but females are unequal in their time distribution \n(Fig. 7). Species richness was higher in the first year during \nspring (S = 21), as found by podgaiski et al. (2007) for \nAraneidae; however in the second year summer had the \nhigher richness (S = 19). Winter had the lowest richness \nfor both years (S = 6 and 7, respectively, Fig. 8). \n\nFor the most abundant araneid species the \nphenological pattern across the seasons was also analysed. \nMangora was the predominant genus in riparian forests, \nboth in abundance and richness. The most abundant species \nwas M. strenua (N = 134; 25% of all sampled adults), \nrecorded in many samples with both males and females, \npeaking during summer and autumn both in the first and \nsecond years; it had a low frequency for winter and spring \n(Fig. 9). Most individuals were found in the forest interior \n(75%).\n\nScoloderus cordatus was sampled from all riparian \nforests and was the second most abundant Araneidae (N = \n69; 12.9%). Females of this species peaked in spring and \nsummer, although males were registered more commonly in \nspring (Fig. 10). This species is among the most abundant in \n\n1\n\nFigs 1-4.

This holds true here as well, since most (45%) \nof these spiders were found in the grassland edge.\n\nTwo Micrathena species were abundant: M. spitzi \n(N = 41; 7.69%) and M. guanabara (N = 13; 2.44%). \nIn the first, both sexes occur only during summer and \nautumn (Fig. 11), being represented mostly in the forest \ninterior (66%), but not recorded in Sinos riparian forests. \nIt has been sampled from restinga shurbland and seasonal \ndeciduous forest in RS State (RodRigues, 2005; podgaiski \net al., 2007). Micratena guanabara was recorded from all \nrivers also with a preference for forest interior (92%); it \nwas not recorded for either autumn or winter (Fig. 12).\n\nWe found nine Alpaida species, three being \nsingletons. A. octolobata (N = 16; 3%) and A. citrina (N = \n10; 1.88%) were the most abundant. Alpaida octolobata had \nits higher peak in numbers in the third sample during spring, \n\nhowever, only during summer and autumn both sexes were \nrecorded together (Fig. 13). This species was found only in \nthe more southern rivers, Piratini and Camaqu\u00e3 and only for \nforest interior. Alpaida citrina had males and females only \nfor the second sample during winter (Fig. 14); this species \nwas exclusive for Maquin\u00e9 river in the grassland edge.\n\nSeven Cyclosa species occurred, the most abundant \nC. machadinho (N = 16; 3%), recorded in all riparian \nforests, and then C. fililineata; both were found mainly \nin the forest interior. Cyclosa machadinho had males and \nfemales only for the fifth sample, during summer (Fig. 15); \nbut females peaked at various times along the samples. \nCyclosa fililineata had two summer peaks, with male and \nfemales together only for the summer of the first sampling \nyear (Fig. 16). podgaiski et al. (2007) registered both \nspecies for the seasonal deciduous forest of high Uruguai \nriver in RS and Levi (1999) cites C. fililineata as occurring \nin gallery forests.\n\nFigs 5, 6.

Araneus \nomnicolor according to levi (1991) is to be found in \nhumid forests; it has been recorded in various studies \nfrom different ecosystems in RS State (indRusiak &amp; Buss, \n2003; RodRigues, 2005; silva &amp; aRa\u00fajo, 2005; podgaiski \net al., 2007).\n\nThe two species registered for Testudinaria were \nsampled exclusively from Maquin\u00e9 river, T. lemniscata \n(N = 10; 1.88%) was again exclusive to the forest interior \nand appeared in several samples, but only during summer \nmales and females occurred together (Fig. 18). Testudinaria \nquadripunctata was a singleton in the grassland edge. \nlevi (2005) cites this species as well represented in varied \nenvironments and vegetation strata, but as their webs are \nnocturnal, this might explain its low representation here. \n\nThe results show that the Araneidae fauna of Rio \nGrande do Sul State is becoming well known taxonomically, \nhowever, more work focusing on ecological aspects are \nnecessary. Our expectations about different araneid spider \nabundance and richness on rivers were confirmed, and the \nbiological edge hypothesis, considering the distinct nature \nof edges, evaluated here, was also confirmed. We need to \nbetter understand the life histories of the spiders from this \nfamily in different ecosystems and their habitats in southern \nBrazil. We hope the increasing amount of information \non Neotropical spiders being produced will allow us \nnevertheless to paint a picture of the relationships of araneid \nspiders and riparian forests, fostering the understanding of \nthe ecosystems they live in as well. They can be invaluable \nfor conservation efforts, given their important ecosystem \nfunction and even its public appeal.\n\nAcknowledgements.
