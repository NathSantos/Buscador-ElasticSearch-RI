The objectives of this research were 1) to characterize\nphysical properties of two horticultural substrates (S1 and S2), 2) to evaluate the effect of different bulk\ndensities values of those substrates on their air/water relationship, and 3) to develop mathematical functions\nto estimate the air/water relationship by increasing substrates bulk density value. First, the distribution of\nparticles size, the bulk density, and the water release curve of the substrates were determined. Then, substrates\nwere packed with three different bulk density values, i.e. 10% (D1), 20% (D2) and 30% (D3), higher than the\nbulk density (D) determined in the characterization phase. The water release curves were determined for each\nbulk density value of both substrates. The effect of increasing substrate bulk density in the total porosity\n(TP), aeration space (AS), available water (AW), easily available water (EAW), buffering water (BW), and\nin the remaining water (RW) was evaluated using simple linear regression and polynomial analysis. The\nparticles size distribution and the water release curves were significantly different for the two substrates.\nIncreasing the bulk density value decreased TP and AS, and increased BW and RW. The highest values of AW\nand EAW were observed for D1. Regression equations obtained can be used to choose the more appropriate\nair/water relationship for each growing condition.\nKey words: particle size distribution, substrate bulk density, water release curve, regression equation\n\nDENSIDADE E RELA\u00c7\u00c3O AR/\u00c1GUA DE\nSUBSTRATOS HORT\u00cdCOLAS\n\nRESUMO: Altera\u00e7\u00f5es na densidade do substrato durante o cultivo das plantas modificam suas propriedades\nf\u00edsicas.

The substrate, a me-\ndium in which roots can grow, also serves as physical\nsupport for plants. It can be constituted of pure materi-\nals or mixtures. An adequate substrate for plant grow-\ning must present high water retension capacity, fast wa-\nter drainage, and appropriate aeration (Ansorena, 1994).\nThese characteristics are directly influenced by the\n\nsubstrate\u2019s particle size distribution and bulk density\n(Verdonck &amp; Gabri\u00ebls, 1988; Ansorena, 1994; K\u00e4mpf,\n2000).\n\nThe particle size distribution is important to de-\nscribe the physical quality of the material and its suitable-\nness for plant growth. It influences the volume of air and\nwater held by the substrate. The particle size distribution\nof the materials used as substrate can vary depending on\ntheir origin and grinding conditions, among other factors\n(Ansorena, 1994).\n\n\n\nAttributes of horticultural substrate 447\n\nSci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.61, n.4, p.446-450, July/August 2004\n\nAdequate measurements of bulk density are es-\nsential to calculate and understand other important sub-\nstrate attributes for plant growth, such as total porosity,\naeration space and available water. The substrate bulk\ndensity also influences the water release curve. The de-\ntermination of the water release curve is important be-\ncause it yields data on available water to the plants at cer-\ntain tensions (De Boodt &amp; Verdonck, 1972). In addition,\nthe recommendation on amount of fertilizers for plant\ngrowth always refers to a volume, and demands substrate\nbulk density value as a reference (G\u00fcnther, 1983).\n\nAt the moment of filling the container with the\nsubstrate, the relationship mass of the substrate/filled vol-\nume can vary according to the container shape and the\napplied force. Consequently, other substrate physical\nproperties can also be altered. The substrate bulk density\nmay be affected not only during the process of filling the\ncontainer but also during some activities carried out in\nthe greenhouses. For instance, to transport the container\nalready filled out, to press the root system during the\ntransplant, and the irrigation practices (K\u00e4mpf et al.,\n1999). The irrigation may compact the substrate, reduc-\ning the available water and aeration below critical levels\nfor optimum plant growth. Substrate with low total po-\nrosity and low volume of easily available water demand\ngreat care on the irrigation management to avoid plant\ninjuries (Fonteno et al., 1981).\n\nDespite the relevance of this subject, little is\nknown about substrate physical properties changes in-\nduced by bulk density changes, and the effects of these\nchanges during the plant growth period. Therefore, the\nobjectives of this work were to characterize physical\nproperties of two horticultural substrates (S1 and S2), to\nevaluate the effect of different bulk densities values of\nsubstrates on their air/water relationship, and to develop\nmathematical functions to estimate the air/water relation-\nship by increasing substrate bulk density value.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSubstrates used in this work are recommended for\nvegetables seedlings, and were basically composed by\ndifferent amounts of pines peel, peat, expanded vermicu-\nlite and ground coal. Two commercial substrate (S1 and\nS2) were characterized by determining the particle size\ndistribution, using 4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mm\nsieves; the bulk density (D), following the method de-\nscribed by Hoffmann (1970) quoted by Bell\u00e9 (1990); and\nthe water release curve (De Boodt &amp; Verdonck, 1972),\nall in three replications.\n\nTo obtain the bulk density values of 10% (D1),\n20% (D2), and 30% (D3) higher than the bulk density (D)\ndetermined in the characterization phase, the mass of each\nsubstrate was increased by 10%, 20% and 30%. The dif-\nferent amounts of substrates were then used to fill the\n\ncores with the same volume. Samples with different bulk\ndensities (D, D1, D2, and D3) were used to determine the\ntotal porosity (volume water content at saturated condi-\ntion), aeration space (volume water content from 0 to -\n0.001 Mpa matric potencial), available water (volume\nwater content from -0.001 to -0.01 Mpa matric potential),\neasily available water (volume water content from -0.001\nto -0.005 Mpa matric potential), buffering water (volume\nwater content from -0.005 to -0.01 Mpa matric potential),\nand remaining water (volume water content at -0.01 Mpa\nmatric potential), according to De Boodt &amp; Verdonck\n(1972).\n\nParticle size distribution and volume water con-\ntent (%) at different matric potentials of the two substrates\nwere evaluated using analysis of variance for a completely\nrandomized design with three replications. The means for\nparticle size and volume water content were tested using\nthe Tukey test (? = 0.05). Simple linear regression and\npolynomial analysis (at 0.05 probability level) were used\nto model the effects of the bulk density on the total po-\nrosity (TP), aeration space (AS), available water (AW),\neasily water available (EAW), buffering water (BW), and\nremaining water (RW).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe particle size distribution of the two substrate\nwas significantly different for all size classes except for\nthe 1.00-2.00 mm, in which the two substrates had the\nsame value (20%). The substrate S1 had larger amount of\nparticles in the 0.25-0.50, 2.00-4.00, and > 4.00 mm\nclasses. The substrate S2 had larger amount of particles\nin the &lt;0.125, 0.125-0.25, and 0.50-1.00 mm classes\n(Figure 1).\n\nSubstrates with particles well distributed into\nmany size classes, as observed at the present work, may\nhave settlement of the particles during the handling and/\nor even during the growth period. The smaller particles\nmay move into the spaces among the larger particles. As\na consequence, the total porosity and the aeration space\n\nFigure 1 - Particle size distribution for the S1 and S2 substrate.\n\n \n\nA \n\nA A \nB \n\nA \n\nB \n\nB \n\nB \n\nB \nA \n\nA \n\nB \n\nA \nA \n\n0 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n20 \n\n25 \n\n<0.125 0.125-0.25 0.25-0.50 0.50-1.00 1.00-2.00 2.00-4.00 >4.00 \nParticles diameter (mm) \n\n% S1 S2 \n\n\n\nFernandes &amp; Cor\u00e1448\n\nSci.

On the\nother hand, the volume of water held by the substrate may\nincrease as a result of the increment of the number of\nsmall pores (Ansorena, 1994).\n\nThe mean values of bulk density were 320.1 g L-1\n\nfor the substrate S1, and 309.3 g L\n-1 for the substrate S2.\n\nBulk densities values between 100 and 300 g L-1 are con-\nsidered acceptable for seedlings propagation (K\u00e4mpf,\n2000). Even though substrates used in this work showed\na slight higher bulk density, they could be used in seed-\nling propagation.\n\nThe two substrates showed different water release\ncurves. The substrate S2 had higher volume water con-\ntent (%) up to \u20130.004MPa matric potential, while the sub-\nstrate S1 showed higher volume water content (%) from\nthis point to \u2013 0.01MPa (Figure 2), probably because of\ndifferences between the particle size distribution of the\nsubstrates, mainly those associated with the amount of\nparticles in the 0.25-0.50, and 0.50-1.00 mm classes.\nAccording to Handreck (1983), quoted by Ansorena\n(1994), the more important class influencing the aeration\nporosity and water retention is the > 0.50 mm class.\n\nThe two substrates had TP, AS, EAW, and BW\nvalue close to the range suggested as ideal by De Boodt\n&amp; Verdonck (1972), when the bulk density value (D) ob-\ntained in the characterization phase (Table 1) was con-\nsidered. However, these ideals values are mean values\nsuggested by the authors, who neither take into account\nthe plant specie nor the growth techniques. Therefore, dif-\nferent values of those mentioned by De Boodt &amp;\nVerdonck (1972) may also be considerad adequate.\n\nIn general, increasing the bulk density value, de-\ncreased TP and AS and increased BW and RW (Table 2).\nThese results may be associated with the increase of the\nsubstrate mass that may have occupied part of the pore\nspace that was filled out with air, changing the pore size\ndistribution. The highest value of AW and EAW was ob-\nserved in the bulk density values of D1 and D2 for the sub-\n\nD D1 D2 D3\nS1 S2 S1 S2 S1 S2 S1 S2\n\n----------------------------------------------------%-----------------------------------------------------\nPT aB8.97 aA1.28 bB6.67 aA6.08 bB1.67 bA4.87 bB5.57 bA8.77\nSA aA2.81 aA7.71 bA8.7 bA8.7 cB3.3 bA0.6 cA4.3 cA6.3\nWA bB4.12 bA1.62 aB6.42 aA8.03 aB4.42 bA3.72 bB8.02 bA0.62\n\nWAE bB8.71 bA0.22 aB8.02 aA9.52 aA2.02 bA2.22 bB6.61 bA4.02\nWB dB6.3 dA0.4 cB8.3 cA8.4 bB2.4 bA2.5 aB3.4 aA6.5\nWR dA2.04 dB4.83 cA1.44 cB0.24 bA4.84 bB0.54 aA3.15 aB2.84\n\nTable 2 - Total porosity (TP), aeration space (AS), easily available water (EAW), buffering water (BW), and remaining water\n(RW) in function of the bulk densities values (D, D1, D2, and D3) of the substrate S1 and S2.\n\nMeans values followed by the same letter are not significantly different (Tuckey test, ? = 5%).

Because of the\nincrease of the substrate mass, the particles occupied the\nair space, being the cause of the reduction of the total po-\nrosity, and the pore size distribution changed. Probably,\nthe small particles have occupied the void space among\nthe large particles, transforming large pores into small\nones, which increased the water hold capacity of the sub-\nstrates (Spomer, 1979; Ansorena, 1994). The distribution\nof the substrates particles in several size classes facili-\ntated the adjustment (Figure 1).\n\nFigura 2 - Water release curves for the S1 e S2 substrate, in the bulk\ndensity D.\n\nB\n\nB\n\nA\n\nA\n65\n\n75\n\n85\n\nS1\n\nTension (-Mpa)\n\nW\na\nte\n\nr\nre\n\nte\nn\n\nti\no\n\nn\n(%\n\n)\nA\n\nB\n\nB\n\nA\n\n\n\nAttributes of horticultural substrate 449\n\nSci.

Or-\ndinarily, substrates are recommended for a group of\nplants. However, the recommendation should be done tak-\ning into account the best air/water relationship for a spe-\ncific specie (Bugbee &amp; Frink, 1986). It is difficult to rec-\nommend the best substrate for groups of plants because\ngrowers use different irrigation techniques, fertilizers,\nwater quality, and switch growth techniques very often.\nTherefore, the recommendation of a substrate must take\n\ninto account the grower conditions instead of a group of\nspecies (Verdonck &amp; Gabri\u00ebls, 1988).\n\nAs a result of differences among the values of\nTP, AS, AW, EAW, BW, and RW (Table 2), the math-\nematical function were fitted for each substrate (Figure\n3). Then, the functions were used to simulate practical\nsituations, aiming to help growers to select the best sub-\nstrate bulk density values for specific growth conditions,\ni. e., for a substrate similar to those used in the present\nwork. The functions were used to obtain the bulk den-\nsity values (D) for two AS values (10% and 15%). Af-\nterwards, by using the D values, the TP and EAW were\ncalculated (Table 3).\n\nFigure 3 - Fitted curves, regression equations, and determination coefficients (R2) for the substrate bulk density, and the following\nvariables: total porosity (a), aeration space (b), available water (c), easily available water (d), buffering water (e), and remaining\nwater (f), for the substrate S1 and S2.\n\nA B\n\nC D\n\nE F\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\n250 300 350 400 450\n\nSubstrate Bulk Density (g l\n-1\n\n)\n\nT\no\n\nta\nl\n\nP\no\n\nro\nsi\n\nty\n(%\n\n)\n\nS1 S2\n\nTP = 92.4863 - 0.0420 D R = 0.73**\n2\n\nTP = 97.1258 - 0.0489 D R = 0.83**\n2\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n250 300 350 400 450\n\nSubstrate Bulk Density (g l\n-1\n\n)\n\nA\ne\nra\n\nti\no\n\nn\nS\n\np\na\nc\ne\n\n(%\n)\n\nS1 S2\n\nAE = 64.4740 - 0.1529 D R\n2\n\n= 0.81\n**\n\nAE = 59.7081 - 0.1431 D R\n2\n\n= 0.84\n**\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n250 300 350 400 450\n\nSubstrate Bulk Density (g l\n-1\n\n)\n\nA\nv\n\na\nil\n\na\nb\n\nle\nW\n\na\nte\n\nr\n(%\n\n)\n\nS1 S2\n\nAW = -196.8160 + 1.2107 D - 0.0017 D\n2\n\nR\n2\n\n= 0.89\n**\n\nAW = -165.6100 + 1.1082 D - 0.0016 D\n2\n\nR\n2\n\n= 0.56\n*\n\n-\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n250 300 350 400 450\n\nSubstrate Bulk Density (g l\n-1\n\n)\n\nE\na\nsi\n\nly\nA\n\nv\na\nil\n\na\nb\n\nle\nW\n\na\nte\n\nr\n(%\n\n)\n\nS1 S2\n\nEAW = -152.0950 + 1.0198 D - 0.0015 D\n2\n\nR\n2\n\n= 0.62\n*\n\nEAW = -192.7530 + 1.1747 D - 0.0016 D\n2\n\nR\n2\n\n= 0.90\n**\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n250 300 350 400 450\n\nSubstrate Bulk Density (g l\n-1\n\n)\n\nB\nu\n\nff\ne\nri\n\nn\ng\n\nW\na\nte\n\nr\n(%\n\n)\n\nS1 S2\n\nBW = 1.0630 + 0.0079 D R\n2\n\n= 0.95\n**\n\nBW = -0.7425 + 0.0159 D R\n2\n\n= 0.95\n**\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n250 300 350 400 450\n\nSubstrate Bulk Density (g l\n-1\n\n)\n\nR\ne\nm\n\na\nin\n\nin\ng\n\nW\na\nte\n\nr\n(%\n\n)\n\nS1 S2\n\nRW = 5.7619 + 0.1058 D R\n2\n\n= 0.99\n**\n\nRW = 2.9973 + 0.1169 D R\n2\n\n= 0.99\n**\n\n\n\nFernandes &amp; Cor\u00e1450\n\nSci.
