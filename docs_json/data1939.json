The AIAD model allows the detection of the morphological form of the two-phase flow and the corresponding switching via a blending function of each correlation from one object pair to another. As a result this model can distinguish between bubbles, droplets and the free surface using the local liquid phase volume fraction value. A comparison with the high-speed video observations shows a close qualitative agreement. The results indicated that quantitative agreement of the CCFL characteristics between calculation and experimental data was obtained. The final goal is to provide an easy, usable AIAD framework for all ANSYS CFX users, with the possibility of implementing their own correlations.\nkeywords: \u25a0 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) \u25a0 counter-current flow limitation (CCFL) \u25a0 pressurized water reactor (PWR) \u25a0 hot leg \u25a0 algebraic interfacial area density (AIAD)\nResumo\nPara aperfei\u00e7oar o entendimento dos fluxos bif\u00e1sicos em contra-corrente e para a valida\u00e7\u00e3o de novos modelos f\u00edsicos, realizaram-se simula\u00e7\u00f5es CFD de modelos em escala 1/3, da perna quente de um Reator de \u00c1gua Pressurizada (PWR) Konvoi alem\u00e3o, de sec\u00e7\u00e3o transversal retangular.

In order to improve the modeling of these flow regimes, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) codes are currently under development. In CFD, closure models are required that must be validated, especially if they are to be applied to reactor safety issues. The aim of our experimental investigations of stratified two-phase flows is mainly to deliver high resolution data that is needed for the validation of CFD codes. In order to improve the transient analysis of counter-current two-phase flows, a 1/3rd scale model of the hot-leg PWR of a German Konvoi Pressurized Water Reactor with rectangular cross section was used at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), to perform experiments related to CCFL flow regimes (Vall\u00e9e et al., 2009).\nThis paper provides post-test CFD calculations of the air-water respectively steam-water CCFL experiments at the T OPFLOW Hot-Leg model. The aim of this simulation is the prediction validation of CCFL in a model hot-leg PWR with newly developed and implemented multiphase flow models in the ANSYS CFX code. The Algebraic Interfacial Area Density (AIAD) model (Hohne and Vall\u00e9e, 2010) was used, which allows the detection of the morphological form of the two-phase flow and the corresponding switching via a blending function of each correlation from one object pair to another. The new drag correlation obtained from this model considered the 3D effects of the simulated phenomenon.\nThe hot-leg model of TOPFLOW\nThe details of the experimental apparatus and procedure used in the present study were described in the previous papers (Deendarlianto et al., 2008; Vall\u00e9e et al., 2009) and only the main features are presented here. Figure 1 shows a photograph of the experimental facility. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of the CCFL counter-current flow experiments. Two vessels simulate the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) simulator and steam generator (SG) separator. They are connected by a test section that simulates the 1/3rd scale model of the hot-leg PWR of a German Konvoi Pressurized Water Reactor. The RPV simulator and SG separator are identical vessels with 0.8m x 0.5m x 1.55m (D x W x H) cubic shape. The water levels in the vessels were determined by the measurement of the differential pressure between the top and the bottom of the vessels with differential pressure transducers. A vortex meter was used to measure the injected water mass flow rate. The injected air mass flow rate was measured and controlled using thermal mass flow meters.\nThe test section is composed of a horizontal rectangular channel, a bend that connects it to an upward inclined and expanded channel, and a quarter of a circle representing the steam generator inlet chamber. The horizontal part of the test section is 2.12m long and has a rectangular cross-section of 0.05m x 0.25m. The riser is 0.23m long, has an inclination of 50\u00b0 to the horizontal plane and an expansion angle of 7.5\u00b0. The inner and outer bend radii of curvature were 0.25 and 0.5m, respectively. The test section was made of stainless steel and was equipped with glass windows to allow visual observation. The flow behavior was recorded by a high-speed video camera at frequencies of 60\u2014100Hz and a shutter speed of 1/1000s.\nIn the experiment, a constant water flow rate was injected at the bottom of the SG simulator from where it can flow through the test section to the RPV simulator. The gas was injected into the RPV simulator from the top and flowed through the test section in counter-current to\nFigure 1 -TOPFLOWHot-leg model in front of the pressure\tFigura 1 - TOPFLOW Modelo de perna quente em frente Figura 1 - TOPFLOW Modelo de pierna caliente delante\nchamber.\tda c\u00e2mara de press\u00e3o.\tde la c\u00e1mara de presi\u00f3n.\nFigure 2 -Schematic diagram of the CCFL counter-current flow experiments.\nFigura 2 - Diagrama esquem\u00e1tico dos experimentos CCFL de fluxo em contracorrente.\nFigura 2 - Diagrama esquem\u00e1tico de los experimentos CCFL de flujo en contracorrente.\nthe water flow to the SG separator (fig. 3). The increase of the water level in the RPV simulator was used to determine the water flow rate streaming over the test section (discharge flow). The onset of flooding was defined as the limiting point of stability of the counter-current flow, indicated by the maximum air mass flow rate at which the down-flowing water mass flow rate is equal to the inlet water mass flow rate. This experimental apparatus is put in a pressure chamber, where it was operated in pressure equilibrium with the inner atmosphere of the tank. A compressor system allows an increase of the air pressure in the chamber to a maximum of 5MPa, which is also the maximum operational pressure of the hot-leg model. The detailed principle of the pressure equilibrium technique was described by Prasser et al. (2006).\nComputational modeling\nFree surface modeling\nThe CFD simulation of free surface flows can be performed using the multi-fluid Euler-Euler modeling approach available in ANSYS CFX. Detailed derivation of the two-fluid model can be found in the book of Ishii and Hibiki (2006). However, it requires careful treatment in several aspects of the model:\nThe interfacial area density should satisfy the integral volume balance condition. In the case of when surface waves are present, their contribution to the interfacial area density should be taken into account;\nFigure 3 - Different morphologies under slug flow conditions.\nFigura 3 - Diferentes morfologias sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fluxo de tamp\u00f5es.\nFigura 3 - Diferentes morfolog\u00edas bajo condiciones de flujo de tampones.\n\u25a0\tThe turbulence model should address the damping of turbulence near the free surface;\n\u25a0\tThe interphase momentum models should take into account the surface morphology;\nIn the present simulation, the conservation and momentum equations of the two-fluid model are solved, which have the following form:\n'\u2022\t'\t'\t; \u2022\tI1)\not\n(2)\nwhere the subscript k denotes gas or liquid phase, p is the density, u is the velocity vector, t is the time, p is the pressure, g is the gravitational acceleration, r is the volume fraction, t is the shear stress (tv is the average viscous shear stress, t is the turbulent shear stress) and t is the interfacial shear stress.\nIn horizontal two-phase flow simulations, the air bubble in the water can be resulted by the drag force. The total drag force is derived from the interfacial shear stress (FD=tD .A), and is most conveniently expressed in terms of the dimensionless drag coefficient CD\n(3)\nwhere pLG is the average density, \\(UL - UG)\\ is the relative velocity and A is the projected area of the body in flow direction (interfacial area density).\nThe Algebraic Interfacial Area Density (AIAD) model\nFigure 3 shows different morphologies for slug flow conditions. The HZDR develops, in close cooperation with ANSYS CFX, an Algebraic Interfacial Area Density (AIAD) Model (Egorov, 2004; Hohne and Vall\u00e9e, 2009). The basic idea of the model is:\n\u25a0\tThe interfacial area density allows the detection of the morphological form and the corresponding switching of each correlation from one object pair to another;\n\u25a0\tIt provides a law for the interfacial area density and the drag coefficient for full range 0<r<1;\n\u25a0\tThe model improves the physical modeling in the asymptotic limits of bubbly and droplet flows;\n\u25a0\tThe interfacial area density in the intermediate range is set to the interfacial area density for free surface.\nMore details of the AIAD model are described in Hohne and Vall\u00e9e (2009, 2010).\nModeling the free surface drag\nIn simulations of free surface flows, equation 3 does not represent a realistic physical model. It is reasonable to expect that the velocities of both fluids in the vicinity of the interface are rather similar. To achieve this result, a shear stress like a wall shear stress is assumed near the surface from both sides to reduce the velocity differences of both phases.\nA viscous fluid moving along a \"solid\" like boundary will incur a shear stress, the no-slip condition; the morphology region \"free surface\" is the boundary layer, the shear stress is imparted onto the boundary as a result of this loss of velocity\ndu I\n&lt;(4)\nThe components of the normal vector at the free surface are taken from the gradients of the void fraction in x,y,z directions. To use these directions of the normal vectors, the gradients of gas/liquid velocities, which are used to calculate the wall shear stress on the free surface, are weighted with the absolute value of components of the normal vector.\nAs a result, the modified drag coefficient is dependent on the viscosities of both phases, the local gradients of gas/liquid velocities normal to the free surface, the liquid density and the slip velocity between the phases:\n''' A.;' A r\t(5)\nNumerical Setup &amp; Boundary Conditions\nThe gas/liquid CCFL phenomenon in the hot-leg model was calculated with Euler-Euler inhomogeneous mixture model using ANSYS CFX 14. CFX-14 is an element-based finite-volume method with second-order discretization schemes in space and time. It uses a coupled algebraic multigrid algorithm to solve the linear systems arising from discretization. The discretization schemes and the multigrid solver are scalably parallelized. CFX-14 works with unstructured hybrid grids consisting of tetrahedral, hexahedral, prism and pyramid elements. The calculation model is shown in figure 4.\nIn CFD analysis, demonstration of grid independence is a basic requirement as indicated in The ERCOFTAC Best Practice Guidelines (2001), which were specified\nExp.

In the present simulations, very carefully developed structured mesh for most of the flow field was adequate, and local refinements on them were carried out. Here, the effect of numerical diffusion can be minimized by using meshes with a finer resolution, higher order discretization methods and suitable time-step sizes. As a result, a structured mesh consisted of 281,000 nodes.\nwere taken into account by the direction of gravity term. The turbulence properties at the inlet of air and water were set using the \"turbulence intensity of 5% in both phases\u201d. The air outlet was modeled with an opening boundary condition. The inner surface of the channel walls has been defined as hydraulically smooth with a non-slip boundary condition applied to both gas and liquid phases. The Drag coefficient, CD, was determined by the AIAD model (equation 4), and its implementation into CFX was\nFigure 4 - Calculation domain.\tI Figura 4 - Dom\u00ednio de c\u00e1lculo.\tI Figura 4 - Dominio de c\u00e1lculo.\nThree calculations have been performed for two HZDR experimental runs (30-05, 30-09 and 11-01), and they are summarized in table 1. The injected gas mass flow rates used in the present calculation were a function of time.\nThe Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was used. The SST model works by solving a turbulence/ frequency-based model (k- w) at the wall and standard k-w in the bulk flow. A blending function ensures a smooth transition between those two models (Menter, 1993).\nBoth phases have been treated as isothermal and incompressible. Buoyancy effects between the two phases\ndone via the command language CCL (CFX expression language). The calculations were performed in parallel with 8 processors of the HZDR Linux cluster. Typical computation time for each case was about 2 months.\nResults and discussion\nThe simulation for the experiment 30-05(see Table 1) was focused primarily on the comparison of typical flow processes and code validation. Further simulations for the\ntests 30-09 (air-water) and11-01(steam-water) were used to test the ability of the AIAD model in the CFX model to predict the flooding curve. CFD studies without using the AIAD model and using a uniform CD have shown, that CCFL phenomena could not be predicted, figure 5.\nAir-Water-CCFL Experiment 30-05\nThe initial conditions of the calculation are shown in figure 5. Here the water is modeled at the SG simulator bottom and flows in the direction of the RPV simulator. There, the water level is lower than in the channel. Moreover, the figure shows the hydrostatic pressure in the water phase.\nFigure 5 - (a) Water level initial condition: overflow elbow; (b) hydrostatic pressure in the water phase.\nFigura 5 - (a) Condi\u00e7\u00e3o inicial de n\u00edvel d'\u00e1gua: cotovelo de transbordamento; (b) press\u00e3o hidrost\u00e1tica na fase d'\u00e1gua.\nFigura 5 - (a) Condi-ci\u00f3n inicial de nivel de agua: codo de desbordamiento; (b) presi\u00f3n hidrost\u00e1tica en la fase de agua.\nThe measurement data of the air mass flow of the experiment in figure 6 at the camera time position (yellow labels) were used as boundary conditions for the CFD calculation.\nFigure 7 shows snapshots of the time course of development of the flow. First, the water can still flow freely to the RPV simulator (fig. 7a). As in this experiment, a hydraulic jump is observed below the elbow. After\nincreasing the air mass flow a partial counter-current flow limitation is observed (fig.7b). Finally, no more water can flow against the air stream (fig. 7c) and the water is gradually pushed back towards the bend (fig. 7d).This results in the formation of swirls in the manifold. These phenomena were also observed in the experiment.\nTable 2 is an attempt at a quantitative comparison of the water level in the channel, the film thickness in the elbow and the water level in the SG bottom. The quantitative agreement of calculations and measurements is quite good, especially with regard to water levels. Comparing the film thickness, it must be remembered that the video camera recorded the entire width including side walls, while the CFD calculation includes only a central section plane. Thus, the film thickness In the calculation is smaller.\nQuantitative comparison\tExperiment\tCFX\nWater Level Channel:\t26mm\t30mm\nFilm thickness:\t6.7mm\t3.4mm\nWater Level SG:\t7mm\t7.5mm\nTable. 2 - Quantitative comparison of calculation and experiment.\nTabela 2 - Compara\u00e7\u00e3o quantitativa de c\u00e1lculo e experimento.\nTabla 2 - Comparaci\u00f3n cuantitativa de c\u00e1lculo y experimento.\nTwo additional calculations have been performed for two HZDR TOPFLOW Hot-leg experimental runs (30-09 and 11-01) to simulate the effect of fluid properties, and they are summarized in table 1. The injected gas mass flow rates used in the present calculation were a function of time as shown in figure 8.\nFigure 9 shows the calculated results of the average water level inside the RPV simulator and the experimental data of the stepwise increase of the injected air mass flow rate. The water level and injected air mass flow rate are shown by the blue and pink curves respectively.

From these figures, the phenomena can be explained as follows.\nThe water level characteristics of both cases are similar, and they are divided into three regions. In the first region, the water level in the RPV simulator increases with a constant slope as air mass flow rate increases. This region is defined as the stable counter-current flow region. In the second region, the slope of the curve of water level in the RPV simulator begins to decrease. This point is known as the onset of flooding or counter-current flow limitations. In the third region, the calculated water level shows a plateau. This means that all the injected water in the SG separator does not flow to the side RPV simulator. This point is known as the zero liquid penetration. The region between the onset of flooding and zero liquid penetration is defined as the partial delivery region.\nA comparison of the CCFL characteristics between the CFD calculation and the experiment is shown in figure 10. For a meaningful comparison, the non-dimensional superficial velocity Jk*, known as the Wallis parameter, is used to plot the CCFL characteristics. Here, the Wallis parameter in figure 10 is defined as follows.\n(6)\nwhere H is the height of the channel. Close inspection of figure 10 reveals that the calculated CCFL points pass through the range of HZDR experimental data, indicating a good agreement between the calculation and experimental data. The comparison between both simulation results (11-01 &amp; 30-09) indicates that there is a minor effect of the fluid viscosities on the zero liquid penetration point ((J*J//2 = 0.0), and the fluid viscosity effect increases with the increase of (J*L)1/2.\nFigure 9- Time variation of the calculated result of the water level in the RPV simulator (blue curve), and the experimental data of the injected gas mass flow rate (pink curve).\nFigura 9 - Varia\u00e7\u00e3o de tempo do resultado calculado do n\u00edvel d'\u00e1gua no simulador RPV (curva azul), e dados experimentais da taxa de fluxo da massa de g\u00e1s injetado (curva rosa).\nFigura 9 - Variaci\u00f3n de tiempo del resultado calculado del nivel de agua en el simulador RPV (curva azul), y datos experimentales de la tasa de flujo de la masa de gas inyectado (curva rosa).\nIn order to make a quantitative comparison of the water level inside the hot-leg channel between the experiment and calculation, interface capture method was developed. To capture the gas-liquid interface in the camera frames, an image processing algorithm was developed. This technique allows the representation of the interface by a water level as a function of locus in the channel x and the time t. Nevertheless, for a comparison between the CFD calculation and the experimental result, a surface similar to the interface in the camera pictures has been defined. Therefore, an iso surface with a void fraction of 50% was chosen, and the coordinates of its intersection with the vertical mid-plane was exported\nFigure 11- The comparison on the water level inside the hot-leg channel between experiment and CFD calculation (air-water test).\nFigura 11 - Compara\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel d'\u00e1gua no interior do canal da perna quente entre o experimento e c\u00e1lculo de CFD (teste ar-\u00e1gua).\nFigura 11 - Compara-ci\u00f3n del nivel de agua en el interior del canal de la pierna caliente entre el experimento y el c\u00e1lculo de CFD (prueba aire-agua).\nFigure 10- CCFL characteristics.\nI Figura 10 - Caracter\u00edsticas da CCFL.\nI Figura 10 - Caracter\u00edsticas de la CCFL.\nmeasurement, and the inlet boundary condition. Therefore, future work on those problems should be considered.\nfrom ANSYS CFX. With this simplification, the three-dimensional shape of the iso surface is not taken into the account.\nThe time-averaged water level profiles for the experimental and CFD calculations are shown in figure11 for the air-water case. In the figure, the water level data are presented as a function of location and the superficial gas velocity. Qualitatively, figure 11 shows that the trend obtained for the simulation is similar to the measurement. As in the experiment, before the onset of flooding, the mean water level profile in the horizontal part increases with the distance from the inclined part. However, a detailed comparison shows a small quantitative deviation between simulations and measurement. The possible reasons are the detection of the maximal value of the water level due to the three dimensional effect in the\nConclusions\nThree-dimensional CFD simulations of the CCFL phenomenon of gas-liquid two-phase flow in a model of a hot leg in a German Konvoi Pressurized Water Reactor with a rectangular cross section, have been performed using the Euler-Euler inhomogeneous mixture model. Selected air-water and steam-water CCFL experiments of HZDR TOPFLOW Hot Leg were chosen for transient CFD simulations. An Algebraic Interfacial Area Density (AIAD) model on the basis of the implemented mixture model was used. A picture sequence recorded during the CCFL experiment was compared with CFD simulation of the commercial code of ANSYS CFX 12.0. The calculated results of the velocity profile and water volume fraction indicate that the basic flow characteristics of the experiment, such as the hydraulic jump near the bend region of the hot-leg PWR and the occurrence of roll wave,\nwere reproduced in simulation. Further the calculated CCFL characteristics and the water level inside the hot-leg channel positions were also in close agreement with the experiments, while a minor deviation required a continuation of the work.\nThe usage of the morphology detection algorithm AIAD should also be possible in vertical flow regimes. Therefore, it is necessary to include the modeling of non-drag forces (lift force, wall lubrication force, virtual mass force etc.) as well as the Multi bubbe Size Group (MUSIG) model for poly-dispersed flows. Also, the turbulence damping procedures should include the existence of small surface instabilities in the macroscopic model. Further, the damping functions from the liquid side should be improved. The goal is to provide an easy usable AIAD framework for all users, with the possibility of the implementation of their own correlations.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work is carried out within the framework of a current research project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, project number 150 1329.
