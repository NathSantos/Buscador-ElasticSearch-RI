No entanto, a verifica\u00e7\u00e3o da\nresist\u00eancia ao fogo destes elementos carece de f\u00f3rmulas simplificadas que se\nadequem \u00e0 mais-valia proporcionada por este tipo de solu\u00e7\u00e3o. \nO principal objetivo desta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o foca-se no desenvolvimento de\nmetodologias de c\u00e1lculo para verifica\u00e7\u00e3o da resist\u00eancia ao fogo de elementos\nmet\u00e1licos com sec\u00e7\u00e3o transversal de Classe 4 com base em estudos\nnum\u00e9ricos realizados com elementos finitos de casca recorrendo ao programa\nSAFIR atrav\u00e9s de an\u00e1lises material e geometricamente n\u00e3o lineares (GMNIA -\ngeometrically and material non-linear analysis with imperfections). \n\u00c9 demonstrado nesta tese que, as f\u00f3rmulas atualmente propostas no\nEuroc\u00f3digo 3 para verifica\u00e7\u00e3o da resist\u00eancia ao fogo de elementos de Classe 4\nem situa\u00e7\u00e3o de inc\u00eandio podem ser melhoradas. \nNo que diz respeito \u00e0 capacidade resistente da sec\u00e7\u00e3o transversal, a\nmetodologia atual do Euroc\u00f3digo 3 subestima a resist\u00eancia das sec\u00e7\u00f5es\nquando constitu\u00eddas simultaneamente por placas de Classe 4 e de outras\nclasses. Por outro lado, mostra-se que os fen\u00f3menos de encurvadura local\nafetam tamb\u00e9m as sec\u00e7\u00f5es de Classe 3 a altas temperaturas. Neste trabalho,\nambas as classes foram tratadas como sec\u00e7\u00f5es transversais esbeltas, tendo\nsido propostas novas f\u00f3rmulas para o seu c\u00e1lculo em situa\u00e7\u00e3o de inc\u00eandio. \nNo caso de vigas com sec\u00e7\u00e3o transversal esbelta, observa-se que as\nformula\u00e7\u00f5es preconizadas no Euroc\u00f3digo 3 s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m inadequadas. A\nproposta para o c\u00e1lculo da resist\u00eancia da sec\u00e7\u00e3o transversal desenvolvida\nneste trabalho conduz a melhorias na verifica\u00e7\u00e3o da seguran\u00e7a ao fogo destes\nelementos mas, n\u00e3o obstante, prop\u00f5e-se novas express\u00f5es que consideram a\nintera\u00e7\u00e3o entre a encurvadura local e o fen\u00f3meno de encurvadura lateral que\nocorre nestas vigas. Assim desenvolveu-se um par\u00e2metro de sec\u00e7\u00e3o efetiva\ncuja utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o permite uma verifica\u00e7\u00e3o ao fogo da encurvadura lateral mais\neficiente. \nPor fim, estudam-se as vigas-coluna com sec\u00e7\u00e3o transversal esbelta,\nconcluindo-se que as f\u00f3rmulas de intera\u00e7\u00e3o do Euroc\u00f3digo 3 conduzem\nsimultaneamente a resultados muito conservativos ou fora da seguran\u00e7a.\nObservou-se que este comportamento se deve essencialmente ao c\u00e1lculo dos\nfatores de redu\u00e7\u00e3o para o comportamento de coluna e viga, mas por outro\nlado, houve a necessidade de alterar os fatores de intera\u00e7\u00e3o das curvas para\nque a verifica\u00e7\u00e3o da resist\u00eancia ao fogo destes elementos fosse mais segura. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nClass 4, thin-walled steel sections, slender cross-sections, local buckling, \nlateral-torsional buckling, combined bending and compression, beam, beam-\ncolumn , fire behaviour, Eurocodes \n\nabstract \n \n\nThis thesis is the result of a research work with the purpose of increasing the\nknowledge on the fire behaviour of steel members with Class 4 cross-section,\nthat is, prone to the occurrence of local buckling phenomena. \nSteel members with Class 4 cross-section due to their advantages regarding\ntheir lightness and efficiency are widely used in steel constructions. However,\nthe verification of the fire resistance of these elements lacks simplified formulas\nthat are in agreement with the added value provided by this type of solutions. \nThe main objective of this thesis aims to develop improved structural fire design\nrules for the stability check of steel members with Class 4 cross-section based\non numerical investigation with shell finite elements carried out with the\nsoftware SAFIR by performing geometrically and material non-linear analysis\nwith imperfections (GMNIA). \nIt is demonstrated in this work that, the existing design rules preconized\nproposed in Eurocode 3 for the design of steel members with Class 4 cross-\nsection in case of fire could be improved. \nIn what concerns the cross-sectional capacity, the present methodology of\nEurocode 3 underestimates the resistance of the sections when they are built\nup simultaneous of Class 4 plates and plates of other classes. Moreover, it is\ndemonstrated that local buckling affects also Class 3 cross-sections in case of\nfire. Thus, in this work, both classes are treated as slender cross-sections and\nproposals are made for new rules to calculate their capacity in fire situation. \nFor beams with slender cross-sections, it is concluded that the formulae\navailable in Eurocode 3 are also inadequate. The new proposal for the cross-\nsectional resistance calculation leads to improvements in terms of the fire\ndesign of these members but, nonetheless, new expressions are proposed that\naccount for the interaction between local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling\nthat occurs in these beams. Accordingly, the effective section factor was\ndeveloped allowing a better design against lateral-torsional buckling of on\nbeams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. \nFinally, beam-columns with slender cross-sections are studied, and it is \nconcluded that the present interaction formulae provided by Eurocode 3 leads \nsimultaneous to very conservative or unsafe results. It was observed that this \nwas mainly due to the calculation of the reduction factors for the beam and \ncolumn behaviour, but besides that, there was the need to change the \ninteraction factors so that the design rules to assess the mechanical resistance \nof beam-columns in case of fire be safer. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nContents \n\ni \n\nContents \n\n \n\nChapter 1\u00a0 Introduction

Introduction \n\n3 \n\n1.1 Background and motivation \n\nSteel members with H or I shape Class 4 cross-sections are widely used in steel constructions \n\ndue to their advantages regarding their lightness and efficiency. In terms of its design in case \n\nof fire, the Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 [1.1] provides simple calculation rules for the determination \n\nof the mechanical resistance. However, according to recent numerical investigations [1.2], \n\nthese rules for Class 4 members with H and I shape proved to be not very accurate and too \n\nconservative. The main reason for that lies in the fact that these rules were developed for \n\nClass 1 or 2 members in case of fire and its accuracy for the fire design of Class 4 members \n\nstill needs to be checked or improvements of those rules can still be developed. \n\nNevertheless, some recommendations are given for the fire design of Class 4 cross-sections \n\nin the informative Annex E of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 in order to account for local buckling. \n\nIn this annex, it is suggested that the design yield strength of steel should be taken as the \n\n0.2% proof strength instead of the stress at 2% total strain as for the other classes design and \n\nthat the effective cross-section be determined as for normal temperature, that is with the \n\nproperties at normal temperature. However, as mentioned before, it has been demonstrated \n\nthrough numerical investigations [1.2], that this methodology is conservative and leads to \n\nuneconomical results. Moreover, the fire regulations of certain European countries have a \n\nfire resistance requirement of 15 minutes under ISO fire condition for buildings with large \n\nspans (for example, industrial halls) where Class 4 steel members are mostly used [1.3].  \n\nPart 1-2 of Eurocode 3 suggests a default critical temperature of 350 \u00baC if no fire design is \n\nmade, which means that even for a requirement of 15 minutes of fire resistance, passive fire \n\nprotection must be used. The use of such prescriptive rules should be replaced with much \n\nmore realistic fire design rules to allow real fire safety engineering. \n\nSome studies have been done previously within the scope of one research project [1.4], for \n\nwelded or hot-rolled Class 4 steel members. This type of study is very limited and cover \n\nonly, for example, the buckling of Class 4 steel columns [1.5\u20131.8] or is related to other types \n\nof steel, for example stainless steels [1.9], for which the constitutive laws differ from carbon \n\nsteel. Thus, more studies must be carried out and practical and precise design rules be \n\ndeveloped. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n4 \n\n1.2 Objectives and Research Programme \n\nThe main objective of this thesis is to study and to develop simple rules for fire design of \n\nsteel members with Class 4 cross-sections, in particular for beams and beam-columns as \n\nclose as possible to the principles of design rules of Eurocode 3 at room temperature. \n\nThe influence of local buckling (see Figures 1.1-1.2) on the capacity of the members is \n\ninvestigated and addressed. For that purpose, the work has been divided according to the \n\nscale of the elements by its increasing dimension or complexity: thin plates, cross-sections, \n\nbeams and finally beam-columns, which are analysed separately and constitute the subject \n\nof chapter\u2019s two to five. Columns have not been incorporated in this work since this thesis \n\nwas developed within the scope of the EU research project FIDESC4 being this particular \n\nsubject addressed by other project partners. Albeit the author did not contribute directly to \n\nthis study, the contributions highlighted in this thesis regarding the calculation of thin-plates \n\nand the cross-section capacity together with the existing formulae of the Eurocode 3  \n\nPart 1-2 demonstrated to be sufficient to address the resistance of the columns with slender \n\ncross-sections in case of fire. \n\n \nFigure 1.1: Example of local buckling of a beam after an experimental test at 450\u00b0C carried out at \n\nCzech Technical University [1.3]. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n5 \n\nFigure 1.2: Local and global buckling on a beam-column tested at elevated temperatures carried \nout at University of Li\u00e8ge [1.3]. \n\nMore particularly, the study of thin-plates in case of fire has the objective of studying the \n\ninfluence of local buckling on the reduction of the plate capacity at high temperature and, \n\nthus, to determine if the existing rules to calculate the effective width of the plates at normal \n\ntemperature can be used under fire situation and adapt those rules as necessary to account \n\nfor the effect of the temperature. Following, the study is directed to the cross-section \n\nbehaviour in case of fire. The objective is to study cross-sections prone to local buckling at \n\nelevated temperature and establish a methodology to assess its capacity under fire situation. \n\nFor the resistance of members with Class 4 cross-sections, this thesis addresses beams and \n\nbeams-columns. For the first, the accuracy of existing design rules of Eurocode 3 is \n\nidentified. The influence of local buckling in the response of laterally unrestrained steel \n\nbeams against lateral-torsional buckling is study in order to develop more accurate design \n\nrules. Secondly, the determination of the accuracy of existing interaction curve of Eurocode \n\n3 to the fire design of steel beam-columns in case of fire is investigated so that the accuracy \n\nis established and more accurate design rules are developed. \n\nTo accomplish these objectives, first a literature review is made. However, the subject of \n\nthis thesis has not been addressed by many researchers in the past and therefore the existing \n\nliterature is noticeably scarce. After, a numerical investigation is performed to assess the \n\nvalidity of existing design rules and to serve as the basis of the development of new rules. \n\nGMNIA (geometrical and material non-linear analysis with imperfections) analyses are \n\ncarried out with the finite element software SAFIR [1.10] using shell finite elements. The \n\ndefinition of the numerical model, namely the material model, the boundary conditions, the \n\ngeometric and material imperfections and the model for the application of the loads is made \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n6 \n\naccording to the literature. The validation of the numerical model is based on reference \n\nresults (both numerical and experimental) found in the literature and on the fire tests \n\ndeveloped within the European Research Project FIDESC4 \u201cFire Design of Steel Members \n\nwith Welded or Hot-Rolled Class 4 Cross-Section\u201d as this thesis is under the scope of that \n\nproject. Finally, new rules are developed and validated against numerical and experimental \n\nresults available. \n\n1.3 Outline of the Thesis \n\nThis thesis is organized into six chapters describing the research conducted in this PhD \n\nthesis. A first introductory chapter is followed by four chapters with the subject addressed \n\nwithin each of which increases in scale gradually: Chapter 2 presents a study at elevated \n\ntemperatures on the thin plates that form slender cross-section, followed by the study of the \n\ncapacity of slender cross-sections under fire situation (Chapter 3), and then, on a member \n\nlevel by the study of the beams (Chapter 4) and finally the study of the beam-columns \n\n(Chapter 5). General conclusions and final remarks are presented in the last chapter of this \n\nwork. The organization of each chapter is presented next in more detail. \n\nThe first chapter serves as the introduction to the thematic addressed in this work. The \n\npurpose, meaning and objectives are highlighted, as well as brief description of the research \n\nprogrammed that was followed in order to accomplish those objectives. In the final part, the \n\noutline and organization of the thesis is detailed. \n\nThe second chapter corresponds to the study of individual thin steel plates that form the \n\nslender cross-sections and how local buckling influences its capacity at elevated \n\ntemperature. A revision on the existing literature to account for the effect of local buckling \n\nat elevated temperature is presented and the methods to design against local buckling in fire \n\nare presented. This last sentence can be rewritten as stating that the design methods for Class \n\n4 cross-sections in fire are also presented. In this sense, the design provisions against local \n\nbuckling of the Eurocode 3 are highlighted: firstly the cross-section classification and then \n\nthe effective width method as given in Part 1-5 of the Eurocode 3 [1.11] both at normal and \n\nthe respective nuances at elevated temperatures. This is followed by the description of the \n\nnumerical model used in this chapter as well as its validation based on experimental results \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n7 \n\navailable in the literature. The aim is to study at high temperature the capacity of simply \n\nsupported internal and outstand thin-plates, that correspond respectively to the web and the \n\nflange of H or I shaped cross-sections and compare the results with the design provisions of \n\nthe Eurocode 3. Outstand plates (flange) are analysed under compression while internal \n\nplates (web) are studied both in compression and in bending. The comparison of the results \n\nwith Eurocode 3 philosophy uncover its inconsistencies and the need to have a better \n\nmethodology to calculate the resistance against local buckling in case of fire. Therefore, an \n\neffective width method to better account with the unfavourable effect of local buckling in \n\ncase of fire, based on a shell finite element numerical investigation, is defined and new \n\nexpressions to calculate the plate effective width are presented following the same principles \n\nas the ones existing at normal temperature. The method presented in this part of the work is \n\nused in Chapter 3 as the basis of a methodology to calculate the resistance of slender cross-\n\nsections. \n\nThe third chapter is reserved for the study of H and I shaped slender cross-sections where \n\nlocal buckling has a predominant role in the ultimate capacity at elevated temperatures, \n\nseveral cross-sections submitted to compression or bending about the major-axis are \n\ninvestigated. In the begin of the chapter, the bibliography available on the subject is revisited, \n\nsome duplication exists with the literature review made in Chapter 2, due to the scarce \n\nexistence of studies within the scope of this thesis. Next, the Eurocode 3 design provisions \n\nto take local buckling into account in the cross-sectional resistance are highlighted. The new \n\nproposal developed in Chapter 2 is again revisited and a simplification of the initial proposal \n\nis also presented followed by a summary of the simplified methods to calculate the cross-\n\nsectional resistance at elevated temperatures. The numerical model used to determine the \n\ncapacity of the cross-sections is presented next, with the focus on the definition of material \n\nproperties, support conditions, loading model and the geometric and material imperfections. \n\nThe numerical study on several cross-sections with different web height and flange width \n\nand respective thickness is presented. The objective is to cover different groups of cross-\n\nsection classifications which are then submitted to pure compression and also to bending \n\nabout the major-axis. The results are compared with the existing methodology of Eurocode \n\n3 and also with the new proposed methodology showing the inconsistencies of the Eurocode \n\nmethod and the improvements of the new proposal also supported by the statistical \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n8 \n\ninvestigation presented. The chapter is closed with a comparison with experimental results \n\nfound in the literature. \n\nThe fourth chapter presents the study on the lateral-torsional buckling of beams with \n\nslender cross-sections. The chapter begins with a literature review about the current design \n\nmethods against lateral-torsional buckling in case of fire, with the focus on Part 1-2 of \n\nEurocode 3. The numerical model used to perform the numerical investigation is then \n\ndescribed: the mesh, the boundary conditions, the material model, the geometric and material \n\nimperfections (residual stresses) and some considerations on how the loads are applied to \n\nthe model. After a comparison between the results of the numerical investigation and the \n\nexisting beam design curve of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 is made. The aim is to demonstrate \n\nthat the current provisions of Eurocode 3 are unreliable for slender cross-sections mainly \n\ndue to influence of local buckling not being satisfactorily taken into account. The \n\nmethodology presented in Chapter 3 is then used to calculate the capacity of the cross-\n\nsections and to analyse the accuracy of the existing beam design curve, and although \n\nimprovements are observed, it is noticeable the need of an improved design curve against \n\nlateral-torsional buckling for beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. For the \n\npurpose of developing new design curves against lateral-torsional buckling, a parametric \n\nstudy is presented where the influence of several parameters on the resistance of laterally \n\nunrestrained steel beams is investigated. Based on the results of the parametric study a \n\nproposal for a new design curve is made for beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire \n\nthat allows for a better prediction of the influence of local buckling and, thus, leads to an \n\nimproved yet safe design method when compared to the results of the finite element analysis. \n\nIn the end of the chapter it is also demonstrated that the new proposal could be used together \n\nwith a factor (factor \u201cf\u201d, but limited to f t 0.8) to account for the non-uniform bending \n\ndiagrams. The chapter ends with a statistical investigation that support the withdrawn \n\nconclusions. \n\nA fifth chapter related to the study of beam-columns with Class 4 cross-section has been \n\nincluded. The chapter starts with a literature review on the topic of beam-columns in case of \n\nfire, with special attention on how the existing interaction curve of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 \n\nwas established which was developed for Class 1 and 2 cross-sections. The interaction curve \n\nfor the design of beam-columns with Class 4 cross-sections is then presented by making the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n9 \n\nnecessary modifications to account for the effective area and effective section modulus to \n\nthe existing expressions on the Eurocode 3. This is followed by the description of the \n\nnumerical study: first the numerical model is presented followed by the geometric and \n\nmaterial imperfections and the definition of the cases studied. The different cross-sections \n\nand loading distributions cases are highlighted. Results of the numerical investigation are \n\nthen presented for two situations, namely in-plane buckling representing the buckling about \n\nthe major-axis of the cross-section and the out-of-plane buckling representing the buckling \n\nabout the minor-axis of the cross-section. The aim is to establish the safety level of the \n\ncurrent design formulation. The inconsistencies of the existing design formulae are pointed \n\nout and rely mainly on the fact that the reduction factors for the column case and for the \n\nbeam case, on which the interaction formulae is dependent, are not accurate enough. For \n\neach buckling direction, the calibration of the interaction factors is also presented and the \n\nimprovements to the original proposal of Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 are highlighted. This study is \n\ncomplemented with a statistical investigation that is performed in the final part of the chapter \n\nand the formulation of the interaction curve accounting to the developments of this thesis. \n\nThe final chapter, the sixth chapter, presents the general conclusions for the present work \n\nas well as a critical review and thoughts on future developments. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n10 \n\n1.4 List of publications resulting from the thesis \n\nThe publications submitted to peer-reviewed journals and resulting from this thesis are listed \n\nbelow.

The reduction of strength and stiffness that occurs at elevated \n\ntemperatures needs to be taken into account in the design, as it increases the susceptibility to local \n\nbuckling of the plates thus affecting their load carrying capacity. The obtained results show that the \n\ncurrent design method of Eurocode 3 to take into consideration the local buckling in the calculation \n\nof the ultimate strength of steel thin plates at elevated temperatures needs to be improved. These \n\nmethods are based on the same principles as for normal temperature but using for the design yield \n\nstrength of steel, at elevated temperatures, the 0.2% proof strength of the steel instead of its strength \n\nat 2% total strain as for the cases where the local buckling is not limiting the ultimate strength of the \n\nplates. This consideration, however, leads to an inconsistency if cross-sections are composed \n\nsimultaneous of plates susceptible and not to local buckling. To address this issue, new expressions \n\nfor calculating the effective width of internal compressed elements (webs) and outstand elements \n\n(flanges) are proposed, which have been derived from the actual expressions of the Part 1-5 of the \n\nEurocode 3 and validated against numerical results. It is also demonstrated that it is not necessary to \n\nuse for the yield stress at elevated temperatures the 0.2% proof strength of the steel instead of the \n\nyield stress at 2% total strain, given that the necessary allowances are considered in these new \n\nexpressions, thus leading to a more economic design. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2. Plates \n\n15 \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nIn steel construction, the engineering challenge of having the most economic structural \n\nelements demands the use of slender cross-sections. Moreover, cross-sections can be \n\nconsidered as an assembly of plates which are often referred as internal (webs) and outstand \n\n(flange) elements and if these plates are thin, with an high width-to-thickness ratio, they may \n\nbuckle when submitted to compression preventing the attainment of the yield stress in one \n\nor more parts of the cross-section, thus affecting the ultimate load bearing capacity of the \n\nstructural members. According to Eurocode 3 [2.1], this type of cross-sections where local \n\nbuckling governs the ultimate limit state are classified as being of Class 4 and their design \n\nrules at normal temperature are well established. Under fire conditions, however, the recent \n\ninvestigations of Fontana and Knobloch [2.2], Renaud and Zhao [2.3] and Quiel and Garlock \n\n[2.4] have shown that the existing design rules are too conservative for Class 4 cross-sections \n\nand hence the need to have more realistic formulae to account for the local buckling at \n\nelevated temperatures, mainly because consistency between the rules at normal temperature \n\nand in fire situation has prevailed. \n\nAt normal temperature, the Eurocode 3 gives in its Part 1-5 [2.5] two methods to account for \n\nthe effects of local buckling in the design, namely the effective width method and the reduced \n\nstress method. At elevated temperatures, the same concepts are used, and in the informative \n\nAnnex E of the Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3 [2.6] some recommendations are given for the \n\nfire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-sections. In this annex, it is suggested to use \n\nthe simple calculation methods with the design value for the steel yield strength as the 0.2% \n\nproof strength instead of the strength at 2% total strain as normally done in the fire design \n\nof the other cross-sectional classes. In addition, it is stated that the effective cross-section \n\ncan be determined with the effective width method as for normal temperature, i.e. the \n\neffective widths of the different elements that constitute the cross-section are determined on \n\nthe basis of the material properties at normal temperature. The early work of Ranby [2.7] \n\nhas demonstrated that this methodology is safe and leads to accurate results for determining \n\nthe ultimate load of plates susceptible to local buckling at elevated temperatures. \n\nNevertheless, it must be noted that, if a cross-section is built up of plates of which some are \n\nwith and others are without local buckling, using the 0.2% proof strength of steel as the \n\ndesign strength underestimates the cross-sectional resistance. Take, for example, an element \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n16 \n\nsubmitted to pure bending about the major-axis with a regular I-shaped cross-section with \n\nClass 1 or 2 flanges and Class 4 web, and therefore the overall cross-section classification is \n\nClass 4. Since the cross-section is Class 4, the designer is forced to use the 0.2% proof stress \n\nas the design yield strength, even for the flanges that are classified as Class 1 (or 2). This is \n\nvery much conservative because in these type of cross-sections it is usual that around 80% \n\nof the bending resistance is provided by the flanges that will have no local buckling \n\nproblems, in that case. \n\nThe limits of the width-to-thickness ratio from which the plates are susceptible to local \n\nbuckling at normal temperature are defined in the Eurocode 3 Part 1-1. Under fire conditions \n\nthese limits are the same as for normal temperature but the value 0.85 235 / yfH   is used \n\ninstead of 235 / yfH  . Using a reduced value of H   in fire situation can lead to a higher \n\nclassification but prevents that classification changes for each temperature, as it will be \n\njustified in the next section. It worth be mentioned that on this subject, Renaud and Zhao \n\n[2.3] point out that it would be more consistent to classify the cross-sections as for normal \n\ntemperature, instead of those recommendations, since the square root of the reduction factors \n\nfor the steel strength 0.2 ,pk T  and for the Young modulus ,Ek T  at elevated temperatures is close \n\nto one, in accordance with the recommendation of calculating the effective cross-section to \n\nbe used at elevated temperatures on the basis of the material properties at normal \n\ntemperature. On the other hand, the experimental results of Ala-Outinen and Myllym\u00e4ki \n\n[2.8] and Yang et al. [2.9\u20132.11], show that local buckling occurs even for cross-sections with \n\nplates that are classified as Class 1 or Class 2 for temperatures above 500\u00baC.  \n\nQuiel and Garlock [2.4] calculated the buckling strength of steel plates exposed to fire and \n\nproposed new expressions for calculating the effective widths and account for the local \n\nbuckling, however, these expressions are codified in a more similar manner to North \n\nAmerican standards than to the Eurocodes and the effect of the steel grade has not been taken \n\ninto account. Fontana and Knobloch [2.2] have developed a strain-based approach for \n\ncalculating ultimate strength of steel plates at elevated temperatures and expressions to \n\ncalculate the effective cross-section, however those expressions vary for various ranges of \n\nstrain at each increment of temperature and are only for outstand elements. Both works show \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2. Plates \n\n17 \n\nthat an improved method is needed in order to obtain a more realistic cross-sectional \n\nresistance at elevated temperatures taking into account the local buckling. \n\nIn this chapter, a parametric study with the help of the finite element method (FEM) software \n\nSAFIR [2.12] has been performed to assess the ultimate strength of steel plates with different \n\nsupport conditions and load patterns at elevated temperatures. Comparisons of the numerical \n\nresults with the existing formulae demonstrate the need of new expressions to determine the \n\neffective width of the steel plates at elevated temperatures which have been derived \n\naccordingly and are herein presented. The necessary allowances for the local buckling is \n\ntaken into account in the determination of the effective width of the plates and as a result \n\nusing these new expressions it is not necessary to use the 0.2% proof strength of steel at \n\nelevated temperatures and therefore the yield stress at a total strain of 2% can be used to \n\ncalculate the resistance of Class 4 cross-sections. \n\n2.2 Actual design provisions of Eurocode 3 to take into account local \nbuckling \n\n2.2.1 Effective width method \n\nThin plates when submitted to in-plane compressive stresses may buckle.

The \n\nlimit width-to-thickness ratio (b/t), i.e. the plate slenderness, for a steel plate to belong to a \n\ncertain class is shown in Table 2.1, where at normal temperature for carbon steel, substituting \n\n210000 MPaE   in equation (2.5), the parameter H  is defined by: \n\n 235 yfH   with yf  in MPa.

For Class 4 \n\ncross-sections, it is suggested to use the simple calculation methods with the design value \n\nfor the steel yield strength as the 0.2% proof strength instead of the stress at 2% total strain \n\nas for the other classes. \n\nIn fact, at elevated temperatures, the reduction factor for plate buckling would be, according \n\nto equations (2.5) and (2.6), ,( )pT T TU U O  with the corresponding non-dimensional \n\nslenderness at elevated temperatures, given by \n\n \n, 0.2 ,\n\n,\n, ,\n\n1.0y p y yp p\ncr E cr cr\n\nf k f f\nk\n\nT T\nT\n\nT T\n\nO O\nV V V\n\n  #    (2.8) \n\nThe ratio 0.2 , ,/p Ek kT T  is almost equal to 1.0 as shown in Figure 2.4, and since ,p pTO O# , \n\nequations (2.2) and (2.3) show that it can be considered TU U . \n\n \nFigure 2.4: Reductions factors for the mechanical properties of carbon steel at elevated \n\ntemperatures according to Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3. \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nk\np,T\n\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\nk\ny,T\n\nk\nE,T\n\ni) k\n0.2 p,T\n\nEN1993-1-2 Table 3.1\n\nii) k\n0.2 p,T\n\nEN 1993-1-2 Stress-strain relationship\n\nat elevated temperature\n\nwith ii)0.2 , ,/p Ek kT T\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2. Plates \n\n23 \n\nThis methodology however, has the disadvantage of underestimating the cross-sectional \n\nresistance if only some of the plates of the cross-section are susceptible to local buckling. In \n\nthis case, using the 0.2% proof strength for the whole cross-section is, thus, very limiting, as \n\nalready mentioned. \n\nThe reduction factors for the mechanical properties of carbon steel at elevated temperatures \n\naccording to Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 are shown in Figure 2.4. There is an inconsistency \n\npointed out by Renaud and Zhao [2.3] regarding the reduction factors for the 0.2% proof \n\nstrength at elevated temperatures, 0.2 ,pk T , since these values are not calculated according to \n\nthe stress-strain relationship of steel at elevated temperatures, and it is unknown to the author \n\nwhere the values given in the Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 come from (see in Figure 2.4). In this \n\nstudy the values of 0.2 ,pk T  used are those calculated according to the stress-strain relationship \n\nof carbon steel at elevated temperatures for the case of the steel grade S355, as adopted in \n\nthe French National Annex of the Eurocode. \n\n2.3 Numerical study of plates \n\n2.3.1 Numerical model \n\nTo calculate the ultimate strength of rectangular plates (a \u00d7 b with a>b) the FEM software \n\nSAFIR [2.12] has been used. The plates were discretized into several quadrangular shell \n\nelements with four nodes and six degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations). These \n\nshell elements adopt the Kirchoff\u2019s theory formulation with a total co-rotational description \n\nand have been previously validated by Talamona and Franssen [2.16]. The steel material law \n\nis a two-dimensional constitutive relation with the von Mises yield surface according to the \n\nnon-linear stress-strain formulae of the Eurocode 3 and the respective reduction factors at \n\nelevated temperatures ( ,yk T , ,pk T  and ,Ek T ) as plotted in Figure 2.4. The integration on the \n\nshell element follows a Gauss scheme with 2 \u00d7 2 points on the surface and 4 points through \n\nthe thickness. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n24 \n\nA mesh density study has been performed and the solution converged for rectangular plates \n\nwith the dimensions of a=1.6 m and b=0.4 m using 80 elements along the length a and 20 \n\nelements along the width b. These dimensions and mesh have been adopted in this study (see \n\nFigure 2.5). \n\n \nFigure 2.5: Example of the numerical model used to calculate the ultimate strength of a simply-\n\nsupported plate in 3 sides \u2013 outstand element. \n\nThe boundary conditions taken into consideration as a restraint to the vertical displacements \n\n(Uz) and rotations (Ry on edge a and Rx on edge b) on the plate edges, displacements in the \n\nplane of the plate were also restrained (Ux and Uy). Loads were applied to the model as forces \n\nand a layer of shells with increased thickness was used on the edges of the plate to avoid \n\nnumerical problems. The numerical model used to calculate the ultimate strength of a \n\nsimply-supported plate on 3 sides is shown in Figure 2.5. \n\nGeometrical imperfections were introduced into the model by modifying the nodal \n\ncoordinates. The shape for the geometrical imperfections was considered as the first \n\neigenmode of a linear buckling analysis and the amplitude of the imperfections has been \n\nconsidered as 80% of b/50 for plates corresponding to the flanges and 80% of b/100 for \n\nplates corresponding to the webs, following the recommendations of Part 1-5 of the \n\nEurocode to use 80% of the fabrication tolerances as given in [2.17]. A procedure written in \n\nCast3M [2.18] has been used to obtain the eigenmodes [2.19]. Residual stresses at normal \n\ntemperature affect the ultimate strength of the plates but at elevated temperatures have a \n\nnegligible effect on resistance of the plates because a relaxation of initial residual stresses is \n\nlikely to occur due to an increase of the steel temperature [2.4].

[2.26] also \n\ncarried out experiments to investigate the local buckling behaviour of H stub columns at \n\nelevated temperatures. In Tables 2.3 and 2.4, the section dimensions, the steel yield strength \n\nat normal temperature and the results obtained in the experiments for the specimens of each \n\nstudy and predicted with numerical models are compared for different temperatures.

Results show a good correlation between the experimental \n\nresults and the results calculated with SAFIR. At normal temperature, the differences \n\nbetween the numerical model and the experimental results are small except for two test \n\nresults where 8% and 11% difference was obtained although on the safe side. At elevated \n\ntemperatures, the predicted results were mainly conservative. Only four of the cases show \n\nsignificant differences (more than 10% on the unsafe side) but they refer to tests where the \n\nspecimens were heated at more than 600\u00baC and where it is more difficult to control the tests \n\nfor such temperature levels.

It can be seen that there is a good agreement for the plates classified as \n\nClass 4 at elevated temperatures ( , 0.639p p TO O t ) and for steel grade S460 but the \n\nEurocode 3 gives higher values for plates with lower non-dimensional slenderness and for \n\ndifferent steel grades, being considerably un-conservative for the non-dimensional \n\nslenderness lower than , 0.639p p TO O ? . \n\nFor internal plates under compression, it is observed that the numerical results obtained are \n\nbelow the design curve of the Eurocode 3, meaning that it is not on the safe side, as it is also \n\nobserved at normal temperature and also justified by the more severe geometrical \n\nimperfections used in this study. Nevertheless the differences in this case are greater than at \n\nnormal temperature, as expected, since the design curve adopted at elevated temperatures is \n\nthe same as at normal temperature, where additional post-critical reserve has been taken into \n\naccount as mentioned in section \u00a72.3.2.1, however at elevated temperatures the reduction of \n\nstiffness and strength that occurs due to the thermal effects, is not accounted for, therefore \n\nbigger differences exist between the two situations.

Plates \n\n41 \n\ngrade has some influence in the ultimate plate strength and this has not been taken into \n\naccount in the design curve of the Eurocode 3. It is also noticeable, from Figure 2.17 and \n\nFigure 2.18 that the post-critical resistance decrease at elevated temperature compared with \n\nthe behaviour at normal temperature. \n\nAt elevated temperatures, as mentioned before, the residual stresses have little or no \n\ninfluence in the plate ultimate strength. In Figure 2.19 this is observed with the comparison \n\nof the numerical results obtained with and without residual stresses. Therefore in this study \n\nthe residual stresses have not been taken into account at elevated temperatures.  \n\n \nFigure 2.19: Influence of the residual stresses in the ultimate strength of outstand plates under \n\ncompression at elevated temperature for steel grade S355. \n\n2.3.3.2 Elements under bending \n\nIn Figure 2.20 results of the ultimate strength of an internal plate under bending are shown \n\nfor various steel grades and different temperatures. \n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nWelded\n 350\u00baC\n 450\u00baC\n 550\u00baC\n 700\u00baC\n\n-10%\n\n \n\n \n\nHot Rolled\n 350\u00baC\n 450\u00baC\n 550\u00baC\n 700\u00baC\n\nU T\n w\n\nith\n re\n\nsi\ndu\n\nal\n s\n\ntr\nes\n\nse\ns\n\nU\nT\n without residual stresses\n\n+10%\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n42 \n\n \n\na) 350\u00b0C \n\n \nb) 450\u00b0C \n\n \n\nc) 550\u00b0C \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nM\nRd\n\n/M\npl\n\nO\np\n\n S235 350\u00baC\n S355 350\u00baC\n S460 350\u00baC\n EC3 (350\u00baC)\n Euler\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nM\nRd\n\n/M\npl\n\nO\np\n\n S235 450\u00baC\n S355 450\u00baC\n S460 450\u00baC\n EC3 (450\u00baC)\n Euler\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nM\nRd\n\n/M\npl\n\nO\np\n\n S235 550\u00baC\n S355 550\u00baC\n S460 550\u00baC\n EC3 (550\u00baC)\n Euler\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2.

A new proposal for a \n\ndesign curve that better fits the numerical results obtained has been developed. This design \n\ncurve has been calibrated as close as possible to the existing design curve of the Eurocode 3 \n\nby introducing the factors TD  and TE  on the expressions of Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3 (see \n\nequations (2.5) and (2.6)), hence the influence of the imperfections is taken into account as \n\nin the original formulas developed by Winter and additionally the non-linear steel \n\nconstitutive law at elevated temperatures is also accounted for, furthermore by using the \n\nfactor TH  (see Table 2.5) steel grade is also taken into account in this new proposal. \n\nTable 2.5: Coefficients to be used in equations (2.13) and (2.14). \n\nInternal compression \nelements \n\nOutstand compression \nelements \n\n0.2 ,\n\n,\n\n0.2 ,\n\n,\n\n0.9 0.315\n\n2.3 1.1\n\np\n\ny\n\np\n\ny\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nT\nT\n\nT T\n\nT\nT\n\nT\n\nD\nH\n\nE\n\n ?\n\n ?\n \n\n0.2 ,\n\n,\n\n0.2 ,\n\n,\n\n1.1 0.630\n\n2 1.1\n\np\n\ny\n\np\n\ny\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nT\nT\n\nT T\n\nT\nT\n\nT\n\nD\nH\n\nE\n\n ?\n\n ?\n \n\n0.85 0.85 235 / yfTH H   \n\nThis proposal is intended to be used only for cross-sections with a classification of Class 3 \n\nor Class 4.

This question however has not been addressed in this \n\nstudy. \n\n2.5 Conclusions \n\nLocal buckling is a major concern when designing slender cross-sections. The existing \n\ndesign rules for taking into account local buckling and calculate the ultimate strength of steel \n\nplates at elevated temperatures have proven to be misleading and new expressions have been \n\ndeveloped. On the basis of a numerical parametric study of several steel plates at elevated \n\ntemperatures, considering different support conditions, loading cases and steel grades, it was \n\npossible to compare the results with the existing design curves for the ultimate plate strength \n\nand to calibrate new expressions for internal and outstand elements that have a better \n\ncorrelation with the obtained results. At normal temperature, the comparison of the \n\nnumerical results with the existing design curves for calculating the ultimate strength of the \n\nsteel plates according to Eurocode 3 shows that there is good agreement between them. It \n\nwas also possible to conclude that the residual stresses influence the ultimate strength \n\ncapacity of the plates at normal temperature while at elevated temperatures their effect is \n\nnegligible. Concerning the steel grade, it was observed that the influence at elevated \n\ntemperatures is more meaningful than at normal temperature. Due to the considerable \n\nreduction of strength and stiffness that occurs in the fire exposed plates, the post-critical \n\nresistance is also limited, but both the Eurocode design rules and the new proposal made \n\nwithin this study have a good agreement with the results for plates with high non-\n\ndimensional slenderness where this behaviour is more important. \n\nAt elevated temperatures, for the plates where local buckling needs to be taken into account \n\nin the determination of the cross-sectional resistance, the existing design rules of  \n\nEurocode 3 show good agreement with the obtained numerical results. For plates with lower \n\nnon-dimensional slenderness, especially in the range of Class 3, the Eurocode 3 however \n\nfails to predict the ultimate strength of these plates and may lead to overestimation of the \n\ncross-sectional resistance, by using the new proposal in this study this limitation is corrected. \n\nOn the other hand, using these new expressions to calculate the effective width of the plates \n\nand consequently the effective cross-section properties leads to a more realistic design. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2. Plates \n\n55 \n\nAccordingly, the necessary allowances for local buckling have been taken into account \n\nconsidering the strength at a total strain of 2% instead of using the 0.2% proof strength as \n\nrecommended in the Annex E of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3. This overcomes the limitation of \n\nEurocode 3 that assumes that every plate will buckle, when the cross-sections is classified \n\nas Class 4. \n\nThe new expressions are temperature dependant leading to a variation on the effective cross-\n\nsection properties under fire situation and although the method herein proposed can be \n\nimplemented with relatively ease of computational effort if compared with the actual design \n\nrules, it was also demonstrated that a simplified proposal can be used instead by considering \n\na constant steel temperature of 700\u00baa CT  . It worth be mentioned that this simplification \n\ncan lead to over conservative results for steel temperatures of 250\u00baa CT d , however these \n\nare very low temperatures and elements with such critical temperatures are not commonly \n\nused with respect to the usual degree of utilization of the elements. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n56 \n\nReferences \n\n[2.1] CEN, \u201cEN 1993-1-1, Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures - Part 1-1: General rules \n\nand rules for buildings.\u201d European Committee for Standardisation, Brussels, 2005. \n\n[2.2] Knobloch M., Fontana M., \u201cStrain-based approach to local buckling of steel sections \n\nsubjected to fire,\u201d Journal of Constructional Steel Research, vol. 62, no. 1\u20132,  \n\npp. 44\u201367, January 2006. \n\n[2.3] Renaud C., Zhao B., \u201cInvestigation of simple calculation method in EN 1993-1-2 for \n\nbuckling of hot rolled class 4 steel members exposed to fire,\u201d in Fourth International \n\nWorkshop \u201cStructures in Fire,\u201d Aveiro, Portugal, 2006. \n\n[2.4] Quiel S.

Conclusions \nReferences \n\n \n\nAbstract In this chapter, the resistance of slender I-shaped cross-sections, where local buckling has \n\na predominant role in the ultimate capacity, is investigated at elevated temperatures. A numerical \n\nstudy considering several cross-sections submitted to compression or bending about the major-axis \n\nis performed using a finite element analysis software. The results are compared with the existing \n\nformulae available in Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3 showing that they need to be improved. For Class 3 \n\ncross-sections, it is observed that the existing rules lead to unsafe results because local buckling \n\noccurs at elevated temperatures prior to the development of the elastic bending resistance or the gross \n\ncross-section compression resistance. For Class 4 cross-sections, the results show that these rules are \n\nnot adequate because it is recommended for the design yield strength of steel the use of the 0.2% \n\nproof strength even if the cross-section has plates not prone to local buckling. A new methodology \n\nto account for the local buckling in steel I-sections at elevated temperatures is presented based on the \n\nexpressions developed in the previous chapter to calculate the effective width of thin plates at \n\nelevated temperatures. According to this new methodology, an effective cross-section is calculated \n\nfor Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections and the yield strength at 2% total strain is used for Class 4 \n\ncross-sections as recommended by the Eurocode 3 for the other section classes. Finally, it is \n\ndemonstrated that this methodology leads to good results when compared against numerical and \n\nexperimental results.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3. Cross-sections \n\n61 \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nSlender cross-sections when submitted to compression stresses are prone to local buckling \n\nthat prevents the attainment of the yield stress in the compressed parts of the cross-section \n\nthus affecting their ultimate capacity. At normal temperature, according to Eurocode 3 [3.1] \n\nthese cross-sections are classified as Class 4 \u2013 the highest class \u2013 and Part 1-5 [3.2] provides \n\ntwo methods to take local buckling into account, namely the effective width method that \n\nleads to a reduced cross-section and the reduced stress method. \n\nAt elevated temperatures, Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 [3.3] suggests for Class 4 cross-sections a \n\ndefault critical temperature of 350 \u00baC if no fire design is made, which means that even for a \n\nrequirement of 15 minutes of fire resistance, passive fire protection should normally be used \n\nfor current profiles. Alternatively, the informative Annex E of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 \n\nsuggests the use of a reduced cross-section calculated with the effective width method using \n\nthe steel properties at normal temperature and for the design yield strength of steel the 0.2% \n\nproof strength (f0.2p,T, see Figure 3.1). \n\n \nFigure 3.1: Stress-strain relationship for carbon steel at elevated temperatures [3.4]. \n\nPrevious investigations of Fontana and Knobloch [3.5], Renaud and Zhao [3.6] and Quiel \n\nand Garlock [3.7] demonstrated that this methodology is too conservative. Hence, the need \n\nof more realistic formulae to account for the local buckling at elevated temperatures. Studies \n\nhave been done previously within the scope of one research project [3.8], for welded or hot-\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n?\n \n\n \n     \n\n  \n  \n\nfy,?\nf0.2p,?\n\nfp,?\n\nEa,? = tan ?\n?\n\nStress\n\nStrain\n?p,? ?y,?\n\n= 2%\n\n?t,?\n= 15%\n\n?u,?\n= 20%\n\n?\n0.2%\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n62 \n\nrolled Class 4 steel members. However, these type of studies are limited and cover only, for \n\nexample, the buckling of Class 4 steel columns [3.5, 3.9\u20133.11] or are related to other types \n\nof steel, for example stainless steels [3.12], for which the constitutive laws differ from carbon \n\nsteel. In Figure 3.2, an example of column showing local buckling from a test performed at \n\nelevated temperatures at the University of Li\u00e8ge is shown. \n\n \nFigure 3.2: Example of column showing local buckling from a test performed at elevated \n\ntemperatures at the University of Li\u00e8ge (taken from[3.13]). \n\nIn this work, a parametric investigation based on the finite element analysis using the \n\nsoftware SAFIR [3.14] is made to assess the resistance of several slender cross-sections in \n\nbending and compression. In line with previous investigations by other authors, the obtained \n\nresults show that the existing formulae of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 could be improved. For \n\nClass 3 cross-sections, it is observed that the existing rules lead to unsafe results because \n\nlocal buckling occurs at elevated temperatures prior to the development of the elastic \n\nbending resistance or the gross cross-section compression resistance. For Class 4 cross-\n\nsections, the results obtained show that the use of the 0.2% proof strength as the design yield \n\nstrength for the whole cross-section is very conservative, especially if they contain also \n\nplates with inferior classes, i.e. without local buckling.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3. Cross-sections \n\n63 \n\nTo overcome these inconsistencies and limitations, a new methodology to calculate the \n\ncross-sectional resistance of slender cross-sections at elevated temperatures is presented in \n\nthis work. Accordingly, an effective cross-section is calculated for Class 3 and Class 4 cross-\n\nsections based on the expressions developed in the previous chapter to calculate the effective \n\nwidth of thin plates at elevated temperatures [3.15] and the yield strength at 2% total strain \n\nis used for Class 4 as recommended in Eurocode 3 for the other section classes. A \n\ncomparison of the predicted cross-sectional capacity using the proposed methodology \n\nagainst numerical and experimental results shows the considerable advantages as well as the \n\nvalidity and accuracy of this proposal. \n\n3.2 Design provisions to take local buckling into account in the cross-\nsectional resistance according to Eurocode 3 \n\nI-shaped cross-sections can be considered as an assembly of plates often referred as internal \n\n(webs) and outstand (flanges) elements. If the width-to-thickness ratios of these plates are \n\nhigh, they are normally referred to as slender and may buckle when submitted to \n\ncompression, preventing the attainment of the yield strength in one or more parts of the \n\ncross-section, thus reducing the resistance of the cross-section and consequently the load \n\nbearing capacity of the structural members. To account for this phenomenon, the cross-\n\nsection is classified as a function of the width-to-thickness ratio of its plates and this issue is \n\naddressed in subsection 3.2.1. In order to consider local buckling in the design, a reduced \n\ncross-section can be used, this method being referred in the literature as the effective width \n\nmethod. The rules to calculate effective width of plates are indicated in Part 1-5 [3.2] and \n\nare described in subsection 3.2.2. The code provisions to take local buckling into account at \n\nelevated temperatures are presented in subsection 2.3. In the section 3.3, the expressions \n\ndeveloped in Chapter 2 to calculate the effective width of thin plates at elevated \n\ntemperatures, which are used later in this study, are presented. \n\n3.2.1 Cross-section classification \n\nIn Eurocode 3, four classes (Classes 1 to 4) of cross-sections are defined in respect to how \n\nthe local buckling affects the load bearing capacity of the members, with a higher class \n\ndenoting a higher influence of the local buckling on resistance. According to the definition \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n64 \n\nof Eurocode 3, Class 1 cross-sections are those that can form a plastic hinge with the rotation \n\ncapacity required from plastic analysis without reduction of the resistance. Class 2 cross-\n\nsections are those that can develop their plastic moment resistance, but have limited rotation \n\ncapacity because of local buckling. Class 3 cross-sections are those in which the stress in the \n\nextreme compression fibre of the steel member assuming an elastic distribution of stresses \n\ncan reach the yield strength, but local buckling is liable to prevent development of the plastic \n\nmoment resistance. Finally, Class 4 cross-sections are those in which local buckling will \n\noccur before the attainment of yield strength in one or more parts of the cross-section. Cross-\n\nsection classification is illustrated in Figure 3.3 for a beam submitted to a point load at mid \n\nspan. \n\n \nFigure 3.3: Moment-rotation curves for different cross-section classification (adapted from [3.4]). \n\nThe limits for each class, are defined in Part 1-1 of Eurocode 3 [3.1] in terms of the width-\n\nto-thickness ratio (b/t), also referred as the plate slenderness.

But, on \n\nthe other hand, the experimental results of Ala-Outinen and Myllym\u00e4ki [3.16], Yang et al. \n\n[3.17\u20133.19] and more recently of Correia and Rodrigues [3.20], show that local buckling \n\noccurs even for cross-sections with plates with inferior classes (Class 1 - Class 3) for elevated \n\ntemperatures. This suggests that is advisable to use a smaller value of the parameter H , i.e. \n\n0.85 235 / yfH   instead of 235 / yfH  .

Knowing U , the effective width is given by effb bU u . \n\n \nFigure 3.5: Plate reduction factor for internal and outstand elements. \n\n3.2.3 Code provisions for local buckling at elevated temperatures \n\nAs mentioned previously, to account for local buckling at elevated temperatures, Part 1-2 of \n\nEurocode 3, suggests for Class 4 cross-sections a default critical temperature of 350\u00baC if no \n\nother calculation is made, which normally is conservative. Additionally some further \n\nguidance is given in Annex E for the fire design of this type of cross-sections. It is stated \n\nthat i) the effective cross-section be determined with the effective width method as for \n\nnormal temperature, i.e. using the material properties at normal temperature and (ii) to use \n\nthe simple calculation methods with the design value for the steel yield strength as the 0.2% \n\nproof strength ( 0.2 p,f T ) instead of the stress at 2% total strain ( y,f T ), as normally used in the \n\nfire design of other cross-sectional classes. These recommendations are based essentially on \n\nthe early work of Ranby [3.24] who has demonstrated that this methodology is safe, and \n\nleads to accurate results for determining the ultimate load of thin plates susceptible to local \n\nbuckling at elevated temperatures.

However, this is an \n\ninconsistent approach. If under an arbitrary loading, a cross-section has Class 4 plates \n\n(elements) and other plates with inferior classes, using a reduced stress to calculate the \n\nultimate load capacity of every plate leads to unrealistic results. Take, for example, an \n\nelement submitted to pure bending about the major-axis with a regular I-shaped cross-section \n\nwith Class 1 or 2 flanges and Class 4 web. In this case using the 0.2% proof strength in the \n\nwhole section due to the web classification is very restrictive because in these types of cross-\n\nsections it is usual that around 80% of the bending resistance is provided by the flanges that \n\nwill have no local buckling problems. This is exemplified further in this study, but one can \n\nrefer to Figure 3.19 where the moment-rotation curve for a beam in bending is shown for a \n\ncross-section with Class 2 flanges and Class 4 web, for the different temperatures the results \n\nof the finite element analysis are more than 20% above the ultimate capacity predicted by \n\nEurocode 3. \n\nOn the other hand, there is an inconsistency pointed out by Renaud and Zhao in [3.6] \n\nregarding the reduction factors for the 0.2% proof strength at elevated temperatures, 0.2 ,pk T , \n\ngiven in the Table E.1 of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3. These values do not correspond to the ones \n\ncalculated according to the stress-strain relationship of steel at elevated temperatures given \n\nin the same norm, and it is unknown to the author where the values given in the Part 1-2 of \n\nEurocode 3 come from. The values of 0.2 ,pk T  that are used in this study correspond to the \n\nones that are calculated according to the stress-strain relationship of carbon steel at elevated \n\ntemperatures for the case of the steel grade S355, as adopted in the French National Annex \n\nof Eurocode 3. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n70 \n\n3.3 New proposal to calculate the effective width at elevated temperatures \n\nDue to the limitations aforementioned, new expressions for the plate reduction factor ( U ) \n\nhave been developed in Chapter 2 (see also [3.15]) in order to replace the use of the design \n\nyield strength corresponding to the 0.2% proof strength ( 0.2 p,f T ) with the stress for 2% total \n\nstrain ( y,f T ). The proposed design curves have been calibrated using a format as closer as \n\npossible to the existing design curve of Eurocode 3 by introducing the factors TD  and TE  on \n\nthe expressions of Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3 (see equations (3.3) and (3.4)). \n\nAccording to this proposal, for internal compression elements the following expression is \n\nproposed in Chapter 2: \n\n \n? ? ? ?\n\n? ?\n2\n\n0.055 3\n1.0\n\np\n\np\n\nT\n\nT\n\nE\n\nT\nT E\n\nT\n\nO D \\\nU\n\nO D\n\n? ? ?\n d\n\n?\n (3.8) \n\nand for outstand compression elements is proposed in Chapter 2: \n\n \n? ?\n\n? ?\n2\n\n0.188\n1.0\n\np\n\np\n\nT\n\nT\n\nE\n\nT\nT E\n\nT\n\nO D\nU\n\nO D\n\n? ?\n d\n\n?\n (3.9) \n\nThe coefficients to be used in equations (3.8) and (3.9) are given in Table 3.2 (see  \n\nChapter 2). \n\nTable 3.2: Coefficients to be used in equations (3.8) and (3.9). \n\nInternal compression \nelements \n\nOutstand compression \nelements \n\n0.2 ,\n\n,\n\n0.2 ,\n\n,\n\n0.9 0.315\n\n2.3 1.1\n\np\n\ny\n\np\n\ny\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nT\nT\n\nT T\n\nT\nT\n\nT\n\nD\nH\n\nE\n\n ?\n\n ?\n \n\n0.2 ,\n\n,\n\n0.2 ,\n\n,\n\n1.1 0.630\n\n2 1.1\n\np\n\ny\n\np\n\ny\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nT\nT\n\nT T\n\nT\nT\n\nT\n\nD\nH\n\nE\n\n ?\n\n ?\n \n\n0.85 0.85 235 / yfTH H   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3.

Cross-sections \n\n75 \n\n3.5 Numerical model \n\nIn this section, the numerical model used to investigate the accuracy of the proposed \n\nmethodologies to calculate the ultimate capacity of slender cross-sections at elevated \n\ntemperatures is presented. For the numerical models, geometric and material non-linear \n\nanalyses with imperfections (GMNIA) with shell finite elements were used. The finite \n\nelement model was implemented using the software SAFIR, which has been developed \n\nspecifically for the analysis of structures in case of fire [3.14]. The capability of SAFIR to \n\nmodel local buckling with shell elements was validated by Talamona and Franssen [3.25]. \n\nThe members were discretized into several quadrangular shell elements with four nodes and \n\nsix degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations). The SAFIR shell elements adopt the \n\nKirchoff\u2019s theory formulation with a total co-rotational description. The steel material law \n\nis a two-dimensional constitutive relation with the von Mises yield surface according to the \n\nnon-linear stress-strain formulae of Eurocode 3 and the respective reduction factors at \n\nelevated temperatures. The integration on the shell element follows a Gauss scheme  \n\nwith 2 \u00d7 2 points on the surface and 4 points through the thickness. The temperature has \n\nbeen considered uniform along the cross-section so that a comparison between the numerical \n\nresults and the simple design equations is possible. The cross-sectional resistance at elevated \n\ntemperatures was determined by firstly increasing the temperature to the desired value and \n\nthen applying an increasing load until the failure is reached. A mesh sensitivity study has \n\nbeen performed and the solution converged for the members discretized into 100 divisions \n\non the length, 10 divisions on the flange width and 22 divisions of the web height. \n\nAdditionally, for the cases where the ratio between the flange width and the web height is \n\nclose to one the divisions on the flange width were doubled. The length of the members was \n\nset as 10 times the web height. The numerical model has been validated against experimental \n\nresults in a previous work [3.15] (see Chapter 2). \n\n3.5.1 Material properties \n\nS235, S355 and S460 steel grades were considered in the numerical investigations, with a \n\nyield strength at normal temperature of 235 MPa, 355 MPa and 460 MPa respectively, a \n\nmodulus of elasticity of 210 GPa at normal temperature and a Poisson\u2019s ratio of 0.3. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n76 \n\n3.5.2 Support conditions \n\nSingle span members were considered with the boundary conditions defined in order to \n\ndetermine the axial compression resistance and flexural bending resistance about the major-\n\naxis. For compression members, fully-fixed supports were considered in one end and free in \n\nthe other, the displacements were also restrained in the transversal direction (Uy) and vertical \n\ndirection (Uz) in the intersection of the web with the flange as illustrated in Figure 3.8. For \n\nmembers in bending about the major-axis, fork-supports were considered in both ends \n\nrestraining the transversal displacements (Uy) along the web and restraining the vertical \n\ndisplacements (Uz) in the lower flange. Additionally, the transversal displacements (Uy) \n\nwere also restrained in the upper flange in this case. \n\n \nFigure 3.8: Illustration of the numerical model. \n\n3.5.3 Loading \n\nThe loads were modelled by applying distributed loads (by means of nodal forces) on the \n\nflanges and on the web as indicated in Figure 3.9 for each loading case. To avoid numerical \n\nproblems, an additional layer of shell elements with higher thickness was used in the \n\nextremities of the structural elements to apply the loads that correspond to the applied end \n\nmoments or the axial compression force. \n\ny\nx\n\nz\n\nA Bupper\nflange-web\nintersection\n\nlower\nflange-web\nintersection\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3.

The geometrical imperfections were introduced in the models by scaling the \n\nfirst eigenmode with an amplitude corresponding to 80 % of the geometric fabrication \n\ntolerances given in the EN 1090-2 [3.26]. Accordingly, the amplitude was considered as \n\nb/100 where b is the web height or the flange width depending on the location of the most \n\ndisplaced node of the eigenmode. Additionally, if the maximum displaced node was in the \n\nweb, an amplitude of at least 4 mm was considered, as recommended in the norm. For both \n\nmodels, the residual stresses were not considered because their effect at elevated \n\ntemperatures is negligible in the ultimate cross-sectional resistance [3.15]. \n\n3.6 Numerical study \n\nAn extensive numerical study was conducted to investigate the ultimate capacity of several \n\nI-shaped cross-sections under compression and bending about the major-axis when exposed \n\nto fire. The numerical model described in section 3.5 was used. The cross-sections that were \n\nused in this numerical study are described in subsection 3.6.1. The steel grades S235, S355 \n\nand S460 were considered. The temperatures chosen were 350, 450, 550 and 700\u00baC and \n\nconsidered constant in the whole cross-section to allow direct comparison with the simplified \n\ndesign methods. The results obtained are presented in subsection 3.6.2 and it is demonstrated \n\nthat the existing methodology of Eurocode 3 to predict the ultimate capacity of cross-sections \n\nprone to local buckling when exposed to elevated temperatures needs to be improved. On \n\nthe other hand, the comparison of the results with the methodologies proposed in this chapter \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n78 \n\ndemonstrates their validity and improvements towards a better prediction of the cross-\n\nsectional capacity at elevated temperatures. This conclusion is also supported by the \n\nstatistical investigation presented in subsection 3.6.3. \n\n3.6.1 Cross-sections \n\nIn this section, the definition and classification of cross-sections used in the numerical study \n\nare indicated. The cross-sections were defined in order to have a large set of results and to \n\ncover different cases of cross-section classification (see Subsection 3.2.1). A total of 324 \n\ncross-sections submitted to compression and 376 cross-sections submitted to bending about \n\nmajor-axis with different width-to-thickness ratios of their plates were investigated. The \n\nchoice of the cross-section dimensions was based on the ones used in current practice as well \n\nas extreme geometries in order to cover a wider scope of application. The web height (hw) \n\nwas defined as 450, 634, 817 and 1000 mm for the compression cases and 450, 1000 \n\nand 2000 mm for the bending cases. The flange width (bf) was defined as 150, 157, 184, 200 \n\nand 450 mm for the compression cases and as 150, 300 and 420 mm for the bending cases. \n\nFor the compression cases, the thickness of the web (tw) and flanges (tf) was chosen in order \n\nto cover the ranges of Class 2, Class 3 and Class 4 and for the bending cases to cover  \n\nClass 3 and Class 4 and the frontier between these two classification limits. Finally, the \n\ndifferent configurations of web and flange geometries were combined in order to have cross-\n\nsections classified as Class 3 and Class 4 with various combinations of flange and web \n\nclassifications. Figures 3.10 \u2013 3.11 show the different combinations of the cross-sections \n\nused in this parametric study.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3.

A value higher than 1.0 means that the resistance predicted by the EN1993-1-2 is \n\nhigher than that obtained with FEA and therefore the results are unsafe. A value less than \n\n1.0 means the results are safe when compared to the numerical results. \n\n34\n\n13\n\n23\n29\n\n23\n\n54\n\n23\n\n10\n\n115\n\n1-4 2-3 2-4 3-1 3-3 3-4 4-1 4-3 4-4\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125 Total: 324 cross-sections\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr o\n\nf c\nro\n\nss\n-s\n\nec\ntio\n\nns\n in\n\n c\nom\n\npr\nes\n\nsi\non\n\nclass flange - class web\n\n35\n\n20\n13\n\n21\n30\n\n77\n\n24\n\n156\n\n1-3 1-4 2-3 2-4 3-3 3-4 4-3 4-4\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr o\n\nf c\nro\n\nss\n-s\n\nec\ntio\n\nns\n in\n\n s\nim\n\npl\ne \n\nbe\nnd\n\nin\ng\n\nclass flange - class web\n\nTotal: 376 cross-sections\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3.

Comparison between FEA and Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3. \n\nIt is shown that for Class 3 profiles the current simple design methods of Part 1-2 of \n\nEurocode 3 give higher resistance than the obtained numerically (results are unsafe) while \n\nfor Class 4 the predicted capacity is less than those obtained numerically (results are \n\nconservative). For Class 3 members, observation of the failure mode shows that local \n\nbuckling occurs preventing the cross-section to reach the full resistance. This is exemplified \n\nin Figure 3.14 for a Class 3 profile (I450\u00d718+450\u00d730, steel grade S460), where it can be \n\nseen the deformed shape at collapse where local buckling in the web and in the flanges is \n\nevident. \n\n0 4 8 12 16\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n(compression)\n\n? ?? ?/ 2 /w w f fh t t b\n\n 1 - 4  3 - 4\n 2 - 3  4 - 1\n 2 - 4  4 - 3\n 3 - 1  4 - 4\n 3 - 3\n\nN\nfi,\n\nR\nd,\n\nE\nC\n\n3 /\n N\n\nfi,\nR\n\nd,\nF\n\nE\nA\n\nflange class - web class\n\nUNSAFE\n\nSAFE\n\n-10%\n\n+10%\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n82 \n\n \nFigure 3.14: Deformed shape (\u00d75) at the collapse for a Class 3 profile (I450\u00d718+450\u00d730, steel \n\ngrade S460) at 450\u00baC. \n\nAlthough it can be argued that the classification limits could be changed at elevated \n\ntemperatures in order to classify these cross-sections as Class 4, results obtained for Class 4 \n\ncross-sections are also not satisfactory, therefore this possibility was not addressed in this \n\nstudy. This is supported by Figure 3.13 where it is clear that the resistance of Class 4 cross-\n\nsections is underestimated, especially if they have plates with an inferior class (see, for \n\ninstance, the data points of 1-4 cases, representing Class 1 flanges and Class 4 web). In these \n\ncases, local buckling is unlikely to happen in the non-Class 4 plates but their additional \n\nreserve of resistance is not considered because of the use of the 0.2% proof strength as the \n\ndesign yield stress. This is reinforced by Figure 3.15, where is shown that the deformed \n\nshape at collapse for a Class 4 cross-section with Class 1 flanges and in this case local \n\nbuckling in the flanges was not observed. \n\nF0F0\n\nF0\nF0 F0\n\nF0\n\nF0F0\n\nF0\nF0 F0\n\nF0\nF0F0\n\nF0\nF0 F0\n\nF0\n\nF0F0\n\nF0\nF0 F0\n\nF0\nF0F0\n\nF0\nF0 F0\n\nF0\n\nF0F0\n\nF0\nF0 F0\n\nF0\nF0F0\n\nF0\nF0

Comparison between FEA and Part 1-2 of  \n\nEurocode 3. \n\nThe results show that the prediction of the bending resistance according to Part 1-2 of  \n\nEurocode 3 needs to be improved. For beams with Class 4, it is observed that the resistance \n\nis underestimated especially for members with cross-sections with non-Class 4 flanges. See \n\nfor example the 1-4 and 2-4 points in Figure 3.18, which represent cross-sections with  \n\nClass 1 or Class 2 flanges and Class 4 web. As mentioned before, it is usual that, in these \n\ncases, around 80% of the bending resistance is provided by the flanges. If flanges are  \n\nClass 1 or Class 2, they will not have local buckling, but since the actual simple design \n\nmethod of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 suggests the use of 0.2p,k T  for the whole cross-section (see \n\nTable 3.4), a considerable amount of resistance is not taken into account. It was observed \n\nthat for some cases this could be as much as 30% less.

The \n\nreduced number of experimental investigation on the behaviour of I-shape cross-sections at \n\nelevated temperatures, found in the literature is noticeable. Nonetheless, Wang et al. [3.27] \n\nconducted experimental investigation on steel stub columns with Class 4 cross-sections at \n\nelevated temperatures and within the European Research Project FIDESC4 [3.13], Hric\u00e1k et \n\nal. [3.28], tested four laterally restrained beams to evaluate the bending resistance of  \n\nClass 4 cross-sections at elevated temperatures. These tests were used to validate the \n\nproposed methodologies in this study. For the column cases, two cross-sections were tested, \n\nnamely 234\u00d76+250\u00d78 (Test 1) and 300\u00d76+200\u00d78 (Test 2), whose flanges and webs in \n\ncompression are classified as Class 4 at elevated temperatures. The specimens were heated \n\nat 450\u00baC and 650\u00baC. For the laterally restrained beams, the experiments were conducted on \n\ntwo different cross-sections also for the temperatures 450\u00baC and 650\u00baC. The first cross-\n\nsection (Test 3 - 656\u00d74+250\u00d712) has a Class 4 web and a Class 3 flange and the second \n\ncross-section (Test 4 - 830\u00d75+300\u00d78) has a web and flange of Class 4. A summary of the \n\nresults obtained and the comparison to the predicted resistance using the methodologies \n\nproposed in this chapter are presented in Table 3.6. The provisions indicated in Table 3.3 \n\nand Table 3.4 were used to predict the compression and bending resistance about the major-\n\naxis respectively for the Full Proposal and Simple Proposal. The results of these calculations, \n\nas well as the ratio of experimentally evaluated resistance over the calculated results using \n\nthe proposed methodologies are also summarized in Tables 3.6 and 3.7. \n\nTable 3.6: Comparison of the proposed methodologies against experimental results [3.27] for \ncompression. \n\nDesignation Cross-section \n(hw\u00d7tw+bf\u00d7tf) \n\nfy,20\u00baC \n(flange) \n\nfy,20\u00baC \n(web) \n\nT Exp.\n(1) \n\nFull \nproposal\n\n(2)\n\n(2)/(1)\n \n\nSimple \nProposal\n\n(3)\n\n(3)/(1) EC3 \n(4) \n\n(4)/(1)\n\n  (MPa) (MPa) (\u00baC) (kN) (kN) (kN)  (kN) \n\nTest 1 234\u00d76+250\u00d78 306.3 321.9 \n450 930 834 0.90 840 0.90 914 0.98\n650 295 318 1.08 330 1.12 342 1.16\n\nTest 2 300\u00d76+200\u00d78 306.3 321.9 \n450 830 798 0.96 803 0.97 890 1.07\n650 280 305 1.09 316 1.13 333 1.19\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3.

For most of the \n\ncases, the predicted results are lower than the ones obtained experimentally. For both \n\nproposals, three cases are on the unsafe side with a maximum of 9% and 13% difference \n\nrespectively for the Full and Simple proposal but within the acceptable range as they refer \n\nto specimens heated at 650\u00b0C where it is more difficult to control the tests. Thus, it is \n\ndemonstrated that both the Full Proposal and the Simple Proposal are methodologies that \n\ncan be used to predict the ultimate capacity of cross-sections prone to local buckling at \n\nelevated temperatures, providing a reasonable method to calculate the cross-sectional \n\nresistance suitable for design and consistent with the current state of practice. The \n\ncomparison of Eurocode 3 actual provisions with the experimental results also shows similar \n\nagreement. Unfortunately, these test results do not show the main advantages of using the \n\nnew methodologies comparatively to the actual Eurocode 3 methodology as observed \n\npreviously in this work. \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8 flange class - web class\n\n 4 - 4 (Compression)\n 4 - 4 (Bending major-axis)\n\n+10%\nA\n\nna\nly\n\ntic\nal\n\n (\nE\n\nN\n19\n\n93\n-1\n\n-2\n)/\n\n E\nxp\n\ner\nim\n\nen\nta\n\nl\n\n? ?? ?/ 2 /w w f fh t t b\n\nUNSAFE\n\nSAFE\n\n-10%\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3. Cross-sections \n\n95 \n\n3.8 Conclusions \n\nIn this chapter, the resistance of several cross-sections where local buckling can occur under \n\naxial compression and bending was investigated at elevated temperatures. A numerical study \n\nwith the FEA software SAFIR was conducted for a significant number of cross-sections, and \n\na comparison to the actual design methodology of EN1993-1-2 was made. It was possible to \n\nconclude that the actual provisions of the EN1993-1-2 to calculate the cross-sectional \n\nresistance leads to both very conservative and unsafe results when compared to the numerical \n\nresults obtained in FEA. Three reasons are highlighted. First, the effect of the temperature \n\non the local buckling at elevated temperatures is not correctly taken into account when \n\nconsidering the effective properties determined based on the material properties at normal \n\ntemperature. Secondly, local buckling occurs prior to what is currently assumed especially \n\nfor Class 3 cross-sections. Third, considering the 0.2 % proof strength as the design yield \n\nstrength, for the whole cross-section is restrictive if the cross-section has non-Class 4 \n\nelements. Therefore, a new methodology to calculate the resistance of cross-sections with \n\nlocal buckling at elevated temperatures is provided in this study. Based on the effective width \n\nexpressions at elevated temperatures previously developed [3.15] (see Chapter 2), which are \n\npresented in this study, the effects of local buckling in case of fire are better accounted for \n\nin the resulting effective cross-section. Using this effective cross-section, the use of the \n\nstrength at a total 2% strain \u2013 ,yf T , as the design yield strength when calculating the \n\nresistance of members with Class 4 cross-section is recommended. With this, the additional \n\nresistance provided by the plates that do not have local buckling is taken into consideration, \n\nleading to an economic yet safe design. On the other hand, it was shown that for Class 3 \n\ncross-sections at elevated temperatures, local buckling occurs prior to the attainment of the \n\nyield strength in one or more parts of the cross-section. Despite the possibility of considering \n\nthese cross-sections as Class 4, and the consequent change in the width-to-thickness limits \n\nused in the classification, in this study, the use of an effective cross-section also for members \n\nwith Class 3 cross-sections was proposed. \n\nRegarding the determination of the effective cross-section, two proposals were developed. \n\nA Full Proposal, for which the effective cross-section is temperature dependent, meaning \n\nthat the designer needs to calculate an effective cross-section for each temperature, which \n\nrepresents the more rigorous approach to the issue of dealing with local buckling at elevated \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n96 \n\ntemperatures. A Simple Proposal was also developed, which is not temperature dependent \n\nallowing the designer to perform prompt calculations yet safe and accurate. The accuracy \n\nand validity of two proposals for calculating the effective cross-sections were confirmed and \n\nboth approaches lead to a safer and economic design. This was also confirmed by the \n\nstatistical investigation performed and the comparison with experimental results. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3.

The influence of local buckling is analysed \n\nand the numerical results are compared with the simplified design methods of Part 1-2 of  \n\nEurocode 3 for the case of beams with Class 1 and 2 cross-sections. It is demonstrated that the actual \n\nprovisions of Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 are unreliable. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the \n\ninfluence of several parameters on the resistance of laterally unrestrained steel beams with slender \n\ncross-sections in case of fire: the effective section factor, the temperature, the steel grade, the depth \n\n(h)-to-width (b) ratio (h/b) and the residual stresses. Based on the parametric study a proposal for a \n\nnew design curve is made for beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire taking into account \n\nthe influence of local buckling by grouping the response of beams into different ranges of effective \n\nsection factor. The capacity predicted by the simplified methods using the proposed design curve \n\nleads to an improved yet safe design method when compared to the results of the finite element \n\nanalysis. Finally, it is demonstrated that factor \u201cf\u201d which was developed for Class 1 and 2 cross-\n\nsections, could be used to account for non-uniform bending diagrams if it is limited to a certain value. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4. Beams \n\n103 \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nThis chapter deals with the lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) behaviour of laterally \n\nunrestrained steel beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. Slender cross-sections \n\nare comprised of plates with high width-to-thickness ratio (slenderness) and for that reason \n\nare prone to local buckling. Studies about the influence of local buckling in the LTB are very \n\nscarce under fire situation since LTB has been mainly studied for beams with cross-sections \n\nwithout local buckling instability. Bailey et al. [4.1] numerically investigated the LTB of \n\nunrestrained steel beams, and concluded that both British code and the Eurocode, at that \n\ntime, overestimated the limiting temperatures for unrestrained simple beams in fire \n\nresistance calculations. Vila Real and Franssen [4.2] performed a numerical study, and \n\nproposed a design curve for LTB of steel beams. This design curve was later adopted in the \n\nfinal version of the Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 (EN 1993-1-2) [4.3]. The experimental investigation \n\nof Vila Real et al. [4.4] and later Mesquita et al. [4.5] carried out on the LTB of steel beams \n\nat elevated temperature was used to validate the proposed method by Vila Real and Franssen \n\n[4.2]. Vila Real et al. [4.6, 4.7] also studied the influence of the residual stresses in the LTB \n\nof steel beams, and they concluded that for Class 1 members is negligible, and widen his \n\ninitial proposal to account for other loading types. An improved proposal for the lateral\u2013\n\ntorsional buckling of unrestrained steel beams subjected to elevated temperatures was later \n\npresented by Vila Real et al. [4.8]. In this publication the influence of the loading type, the \n\nsteel grade, the pattern of the residual stresses (hot-rolled or welded sections) and the ratio \n\nh/b, between the depth h and the width b of the cross-section on the resistance of the beam \n\nwas addressed through an extensive numerical study. Based on this study, a proposal to \n\ninclude a factor to account for other loading cases (the factor \u201cf\u201d) as well as a severity factor \n\nfor the influence of the steel grade in the current design method of Part 1-2 was presented. \n\nDharma and Tan [4.9] proposed two alternatives approaches to the current design method of \n\nEurocode 3 Part 1-2 based on numerical investigation to calculate the lateral-torsional \n\nbuckling resistance in case of fire. They proposed an Alternative approach to address the \n\ndiscontinuity between the design method at high temperature and the one at room \n\ntemperature; and an approach based on the Rankine formula that enables the failure \n\ntemperature to be determined directly, without an iterative procedure as required in the  \n\nEN1993-1-2 design method. In the referred studies, the beams were considered uniformly \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n104 \n\nheated and the influence of other temperature distribution was not addressed. On this subject, \n\nYin and Wang [4.10] have numerically investigated the effects of several design factors on \n\nthe lateral-torsional buckling bending moment resistance of a steel I-beams submitted to \n\nnon-uniform temperature distributions. A proposal was made for a modification to the \n\nlateral-torsional buckling slenderness of the beam to account with the non-uniform \n\ndistribution of the temperature along the cross-section, however only the variation of the \n\ntemperature in the depth of cross-section was considered. Later, Zhang et al. [4.11] analysed \n\nthe LTB behaviour of beams subjected to localized fires and concluded that the failure \n\ntemperature may be considerably lower than that of uniformly heated beams. Further \n\ninvestigation on the LTB resistance on non-uniformly heated beams should be done but it is \n\nout of the scope of the present study. More recently, numerical investigation by Lopes and \n\nVila Real [4.12] on Class 4 stainless steel beams was performed. The influence of the \n\ngeometrical imperfections (local, global and both) and the residual stresses was analysed at \n\nhigh temperatures and it was concluded that they are relevant for the determination of the \n\nultimate load and therefore should be considered according to the expected collapse mode. \n\nApart from [4.12], which comprises a study for stainless steel members, none of the \n\nremaining studies deal with slender cross-sections prone to local buckling and its influence \n\non the LTB resistance of beams. The Eurocode 3 [4.13] classifies these cross-sections, where \n\nlocal buckling prevents the yield strength of being reached in the compressed parts of the \n\ncross-sections, as Class 4, the highest class. Furthermore, in the establishment of the design \n\nrules of Eurocode 3 [4.3] in case of fire (Part 1-2), it was assumed that the simple design \n\nmethods were adequate to design beams with Class 4 cross-sections if the recommendations \n\nof the Annex E of that norm were followed. In this Annex E of Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3, \n\nit is suggested the use of an effective cross-section determined as for normal temperature \n\nand the use of 0.2% proof strength ( 0.2 ,pf T , see Figure 4.1) for the design yield strength. \n\nThus, the influence of the local buckling is accounted for by reducing the cross-sectional \n\ncapacity, by reducing the effective area and considering a small value of the yield strength. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4. Beams \n\n105 \n\n \nFigure 4.1: Stress-strain relationship for carbon steel at elevated temperatures [4.14]. \n\nIt must be noted that these recommendations of Annex E are based essentially in the early \n\nwork of Ranby [4.15] who studied Class 4 plates at elevated temperature. On this matter, the \n\nsame conclusions were reached in the previous chapters of this thesis [4.16\u20134.18] for cross-\n\nsections built up exclusively of plates classified as Class 4 but demonstrated that for Class 4 \n\ncross-sections with non-Class 4 plates these recommendations lead to inaccurate results. \n\nAdditionally, it was demonstrated also that the local buckling prevents the elastic bending \n\nresistance of being reached even in Class 3 cross-section. Thus, the load bearing capacity of \n\nthe members with such cross-sections is affected and needs to be investigated. \n\nIn this chapter, an extensive numerical investigation is performed by finite element analysis \n\n(FEA) to study the influence of the local buckling on the LTB resistance of beams with  \n\nClass 3 and Class 4 cross-sections under fire conditions. The effect of the temperature, \n\nresidual stresses, steel grade and the depth-to-width (h/b) on the LTB resistance of beams \n\nwith slender cross-sections are also detailed. It is demonstrated that using a new \n\nmethodology to calculate the cross-section resistance developed in the previous chapters \n\n[4.16\u20134.18] together with the Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 beam design curve leads to an \n\nimprovement on the results compared to FEA calculations. However, it is observed this \n\ndesign curve should be slightly changed for Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections and a proposal \n\nfor a new design curve is made. Accordingly, an effective section factor is proposed to group \n\nthe behaviour of beams with slender cross-sections in a way that the interaction between \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n?\n \n\n \n     \n\n  \n  \n\nfy,?\nf0.2p,?\n\nfp,?\n\nEa,? = tan ?\n?\n\nStress\n\nStrain\n?p,? ?y,?\n\n= 2%\n\n?t,?\n= 15%\n\n?u,?\n= 20%\n\n?\n0.2%\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n106 \n\nlocal and lateral-torsional buckling may be accounted for in case of fire. With this, better \n\nagreement between the simplified design methods and the numerical results is achieved \n\nleading to an improved yet safe design method. \n\n4.2 Lateral-torsional buckling of beams with Class 3 and 4 cross-section at \nelevated temperatures \n\n4.2.1 Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 \n\nAccording to Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3, the resistance of laterally unrestrained beams in \n\nbending at elevated temperature should be verified according to the equation (4.1) for \n\nmembers with Class 3 cross-section and according to equation (4.2) for Class 4 cross-\n\nsections. \n\n , , , , , y, ,/b fi t Rd LT fi el y y M fiM W k fTF J  (4.1) \n\n , , , , ,min, 0.2 p, ,/b fi t Rd LT fi eff y y M fiM W k fTF J  (4.2) \n\nwith ,el yW  being the elastic section modulus, , , mineff yW  the section modulus of the effective \n\ncross-section calculated with the same rules as for normal temperature. y,k T  and 0.2 p,k T  are \n\nthe reduction factors for effective yield strength and the design strength of Class 4 cross-\n\nsections both relative to yf . yf  is the design yield strength and its respective safety factor \n\nfor fire design situation is ,M fiJ .

Beams \n\n109 \n\n4.3 Numerical model \n\nThe finite element model used in this work was implemented using the software SAFIR, \n\nwhich has been developed specifically for the analysis of structures in case of fire [4.20]. \n\nGeometric and material non-linear analysis with imperfections (GMNIA) using shell finite \n\nelement models were carried out. The capability of SAFIR to model local buckling with shell \n\nelements was validated by Talamona and Franssen [4.21]. The beams were modelled using \n\nshell elements with four nodes and six degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations). \n\nThese shell elements adopt the Kirchoff\u2019s theory formulation with a total co-rotational \n\ndescription. A study on the mesh sensitivity was performed and the solution has converged \n\nfor the members discretized with 100 divisions per 10.0 m on the length, 10 divisions on the \n\nflange width and 22 divisions of the web height. This mesh was used in this study. For the \n\nsteel material model it was adopted a two-dimensional constitutive relation with the von \n\nMises yield surface according to the non-linear stress-strain formulae of the Eurocode 3 (see \n\nFigure 4.1) and the respective reduction factors at elevated temperatures ( ,yk T , ,pk T  and  \n\n,Ek T ). The integration on the shell elements is made with a Gauss scheme with 2 \u00d7 2 points \n\non the surface and 4 points through the thickness were defined. The temperature has been \n\nconsidered uniform along the cross-section and along the beam so that a comparison between \n\nthe numerical results and the simple design equations is possible. Single span members with \n\nfork supports as boundary conditions were modelled. Vertical displacements (Uz) were \n\nprevented on both extremities of the beam (see Figure 4.2) on the lower flange and lateral \n\ndisplacements (Uy) were also prevented in both extremities along the web, on one extremity, \n\nthe displacements along the axis of the beam (Ux) were also blocked. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n110 \n\n \nFigure 4.2: Illustration of the boundary conditions in the numerical model. \n\nThe loads were modelled by applying distributed loads (by means of nodal forces) on the \n\nflanges and on the web. The collapse load for the beam at elevated temperatures was \n\ndetermined by firstly increasing the temperature to the desired value and then applying an \n\nincreasing load until the failure is reached. The geometric imperfections have been \n\nintroduced in the model by changing the node coordinates to represent the worst scenario for \n\nthe assessment of lateral-torsional buckling resistance of the beams. This has been \n\nconsidered as the shape given by the eigenmodes of a linear buckling analysis performed \n\nwith the software Cast3M [4.22]. In accordance with the finite element method of analysis \n\nrecommendations given in the Annex C of EN1993-1-5 [4.19] a combination of global and \n\nlocal modes (see Figure 4.3) has been used, where the lower mode has been taken as the \n\nleading imperfection and the other one reduced to 70%. The amplitude of the imperfections \n\nwas considered as 80% of the geometric fabrication tolerances given in the EN1090-2 [4.23] \n\nas suggested in the same annex. That is, the global mode has been scaled to 80% of L/750 \n\nand the local mode to 80% of b/100 or 80% of hw/100, where b is the flange width and hw is \n\nthe height of the web of the cross-section depending on which node occurred the maximum \n\ndisplacement for the local mode. The recommendation of the norm to consider at least 4 mm \n\nas the geometric fabrication tolerances for the web was also taken into account. \n\ny\nx\n\nz\n\nA B\n\nblock Uy\n\nblock Uy\n\nblock Ux\n\nblock Uzblock Uz\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4.

For the cross-\n\nsection with higher flange thickness (see I450\u00d76+150\u00d715, web Class 3 and flange Class 1), \n\nbetter agreement is achieved between the capacity predicted numerically and with  \n\nEN1993-1-2.

For the \n\nintermediate beams with , 1.0LT TO |  it is observed that for Class 3 cross-sections the curve \n\nis slightly unsafe. Furthermore, in Figure 4.6, the accuracy of EN1993-1-2 is compared for \n\nall the FEA simulations undertaken in this study as indicated in Table 4.1. \n\n \nFigure 4.6: Accuracy of the LTB design curve from EN1993-1-2 compared to FEA results with \n\ncross-sectional resistance calculated according to EN1993-1-2. \n\nThe results obtained show the same pattern as for the cases considered in Figure 4.5 with \n\ndistinct results attained for Class 3 and Class 4 beams. Here, for non-dimensional slenderness \n\nvalues of , 0.2LT TO | , more than 60% of load bearing capacity is not considered for Class 4 \n\nbeams while for Class 3 beams the EN1993-1-2 curve over predicts the capacity in more \n\nthan 20%. On the subject of the resistance of slender cross-sections in case of fire, it was \n\ndemonstrated in the previous chapter [4.16\u20134.18] that the cross-sectional resistance given by \n\nEN1993-1-2 formulae in comparison to FEA for Class 3 and Class 4 is inadequate because \n\nit underestimates the resistance of Class 4 cross-sections and overestimates the resistance of  \n\nClass 3 cross-sections. \n\nSince the cross-sectional capacity influences the LTB resistance of the beams it worth study \n\nthe impact of using this new formulation.

For Class 3 beams the results are now mainly on the safe side with a  \n\nmaximum 10% on the unsafe side. For Class 4 beams there is less load-bearing capacity \n\ndisregarded moving from a maximum 60% in Figure 4.6 towards 40% in Figure 4.8 for \n\n, 0.2LT TO | . However in the particular case of Class 4 cross-sections, it is observed that for \n\n, 0.5LT TO !  the use of the Simple proposal for the cross-sectional resistance developed in \n\nChapter 3 increased the scatter of the results when compared to Figure 4.6, ranging  \n\nfrom -20% to almost 30% for instance for , 1.0LT TO | . Although improvements are seen by \n\nconsidering the Simple proposal made in Chapter 3 for the cross-sectional resistance, the \n\nactual LTB design curve of EN 1993-1-2, which was developed only for Class 1 and  \n\nClass 2 beams [4.2, 4.4], could be improved to better predict the capacity of beams with \n\nslender cross-sections as shown in the remaining part of this study. \n\n4.5 Parametric Study \n\nIn order to develop an improved design curve for beams with slender cross-sections at \n\nelevated temperatures, a parametric study was performed to investigate the influence of \n\nvarious parameters using the numerical model described in section 4.3. Here, only uniform \n\nbending moment distribution was considered. First, the effective section factor concept is \n\npresented and its influence on LTB capacity is demonstrated then the influence of the \n\ntemperature, the residual stresses, the steel grade and the depth-to-with ratio was also \n\ninvestigated. \n\n4.5.1 The Effective Section Factor concept and its influence \n\nThe load bearing capacity of beams with slender cross-sections is influenced by the \n\ninteraction between the resistance to local buckling of the cross-sectional and the overall \n\nresistance of the beam to lateral-torsional buckling. In order to account with this interaction, \n\nit is here proposed to group the behaviour of the beams by considering an effective section \n\nfactor s for the cross-section given by \n\n , ,eff y el ys W W  (4.16) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4. Beams \n\n117 \n\nwhere ,eff yW  is the effective section modulus and ,el yW  is the elastic section modulus, both \n\nfor the strong axis. From the results it were identified three different groups according to the \n\ninteraction between the local buckling and the lateral-torsional buckling being high  \n\n( , , 0.8eff y el yW W d ), moderate ( , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d ) or small ( , , 0.9eff y el yW W ! ). In \n\nFigures 4.9 \u2013 4.11 the numerical results are plotted for these ranges of effective section factor \n\nratios. For ease of comparison, in these figures it is also plotted the EN1993-1-2 design curve \n\nfor steel grade S355 as a reference line. \n\n \nFigure 4.9: LTB behaviour of beams with effective section factor of , , 0.8eff y el yW W d . \n\n \nFigure 4.10: LTB behaviour of beams with effective section factor of , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d . \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\nF L\nT\n\n,f\ni\n\nOLT,T\n\nFEA (Weff/Wel ? 0.8)\n\nReference line (EN1993-1-2 S355)\n\n, , 0.8eff y el yW W d\n\nLT,?O\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\nF L\nT\n\n,f\ni\n\nOLT,T\n\nFEA (0.8 &lt;Weff/Wel ? 0.9)\n\nReference line (EN1993-1-2 S355)\n\nLT,?O\n\n, ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n118 \n\n \nFigure 4.11: LTB behaviour of beams with effective section factor of , , 0.9eff y el yW W ! . \n\nFrom these figures it can be observed different trends for the numerical results depending on \n\nthe effective section factor and the following conclusions can be highlighted: \n\nx For , , 0.8eff y el yW W d , it is observed a plateau until , 0.4LT TO | , meaning that until \n\nthis slenderness the capacity of the beams is governed by the cross-sectional \n\nresistance. For higher slenderness ( , 0.4LT TO ! ), the capacity of the beam is reduced \n\ndue to the interaction between the local buckling resistance of the cross-section and \n\nthe lateral-torsional buckling resistance of the member. However, in this effective \n\nsection factor range, cross-sections are more prone to local buckling and therefore its \n\ninfluence in the response of the beams is higher, when compared to the remaining \n\nranges. For this purpose, the reduction on the overall load bearing capacity of the \n\nbeams is also less in relative terms. For instance, the minimum values of the reduction \n\nfactor for a slenderness of , 1.0LT TO | , in Figure 4.9 is , 0.46LT fiF | , for Figure 4.10 \n\nis , 0.42LT fiF | and in Figure 4.11 is , 0.37LT fiF | , this represents a difference of \n\napproximately 10% in relative terms for each successive range. \n\nx For , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d , and comparing to the previous case, the effective section \n\nfactor of the cross-section is higher (i.e. more effective) meaning the cross-section is \n\nless prone to local buckling and therefore the influence of local buckling in the \n\noverall response of the beams is less in relative terms. For this range, the plateau is \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\nF L\nT\n\n,fi\n\nOLT,T\n\nFEA (Weff/Wel > 0.9)\n\nReference line (EN1993-1-2 S355)\n\nLT,?O\n\n, , 0.9eff y el yW W !\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4.

After this slenderness, the reduction of resistance \n\nis more severe due to the greater influence of the lateral-torsional instability mode, \n\nwhen compared to local buckling, in the overall response of the beam. \n\nx Finally, for , , 0.9eff y el yW W ! , the influence of the local buckling is even less \n\ncompared to previous cases, and consequently the plateau is placed at , 0.2LT TO |  \n\nand, as expected, the reduction of the load bearing capacity is even more severe when \n\ncompared to the previous ranges of effective section factor because it is mainly \n\ninfluenced by the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of the beam.  \n\n4.5.2 Temperature influence \n\nThe influence of temperature values on the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of laterally \n\nunrestrained beams is analysed. The results obtained for four sections described in Table 4.3 \n\nare detailed here. The steel grade considered was the S355. The temperature distribution in \n\nthe cross-section and along the member was considered uniform so that comparison between \n\nthe numerical results and simple design equations is possible. The temperatures 350 - 700\u00baC \n\n(in 50\u00baC intervals) were used. \n\nTable 4.3: Cross-sections considered in the study of the influence of the temperature on the LTB \nresistance. \n\n Dimensions \n(hw\u00d7tw+b\u00d7tf) \n\n(mm) \nSteel grade \n\nEffective section \nfactor  \n\n, ,eff y el ys W W  \n\n \n\n450\u00d76+150\u00d715 \n\nS355 \n\n0.96 \n\n450\u00d74+150\u00d710 0.85 \n\n450\u00d76+150\u00d78 0.73 \n\n450\u00d74+150\u00d75 0.60 \n\n \n\nIn Figures 4.12 - 4.15, the results obtained for the various temperatures and for the cross-\n\nsections indicated in the Table 4.3 are shown. \n\nhw\n\nb\n\ntf\n\ntw\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n120 \n\n \nFigure 4.12: Influence of the temperature on the LTB resistance of the beams with cross-section \n\n450\u00d76+150\u00d715, effective section factor , , 0.96eff y el yW W  . \n\n \nFigure 4.13: Influence of the temperature on the LTB resistance of the beams with cross-section \n\n450\u00d74+150\u00d710, effective section factor , , 0.85eff y el yW W  . \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\nF L\nT\n\n,f\ni\n\nTitle\n\nEN 1993-1-2 S355\n350\u00baC\n400\u00baC\n450\u00baC\n500\u00baC\n550\u00baC\n600\u00baC\n650\u00baC\n700\u00baC\n\nLT,?OLT,?O\n\nI450\u00d76+150\u00d715 (S355)\n\n, , 0.96eff y el yW W  \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\nF L\nT\n\n,f\ni\n\nTitle\n\nEN 1993-1-2 S355\n350\u00baC\n400\u00baC\n450\u00baC\n500\u00baC\n550\u00baC\n600\u00baC\n650\u00baC\n700\u00baC\n\nLT,?OLT,?O\n\nI450\u00d74+150\u00d710 (S355)\n\n, , 0.85eff y el yW W  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4.

Beams \n\n123 \n\nThe residual stresses have an unfavourable influence on the LTB resistance of beams. In \n\ncase of fire, this influence is less than that at normal temperature, since in case of fire the \n\ntemperature causes a relaxation of the residual stresses and, therefore, a maximum 15% of \n\nreduction of the LTB resistance due to the residual stresses on beams with slender cross-\n\nsections is observed for both hot-rolled and welded cases. The reduction on the LTB \n\nresistance is higher for intermediate slenderness values ,1.0 1.4LT TOd d  for both cases and \n\nfor slenderness values of , 0.4LT TO d  no influence is noticed of the residual stresses.

The better the steel grade the less is the reduction of the lateral-torsional buckling \n\nresistance of a beam. For instance, for slenderness of , 1.0LT TO | , the minimum value for the \n\nreduction factor on the steel S235 is about , 0.46LT fiF |  (see Figure 4.17 a) while for S460 \n\nis about , 0.51LT fiF | (see Figure 4.17 d) which represents more than 10% increase of \n\nresistance in relative terms. This is in line with the actual provisions of the Eurocode 3 which \n\ntake the effect of steel grade into account in the verifications of beams against lateral-\n\ntorsional buckling through the parameter D (see equation (4.4)). Although it is not here \n\nshown to reduce the size of this chapter, similar results was obtained for other ranges of \n\neffective section factor. \n\n4.5.5 Depth-to-width ratio influence \n\nThe depth h to width b ratio (h/b) of a cross-section is used in Part 1-1 of Eurocode 3 to \n\ngroup the properties of the sections and take into account a variety of factors such as the \n\ntorsional stiffness or the critical behaviour in plasticity as pointed out in [4.29].

Steel grade S355. \n\nFrom this figure, it is observed that influence of the depth-to-width ratio (h/b) is negligible \n\nfor slender cross-sections. As depicted in these figures, no distinct behaviour between \n\nsections with h/b &lt;2 and h/b > 2 is noticed. Since this parameter accounts for the critical \n\nbehaviour in plasticity and slender cross-sections are considered here, explains the absence \n\nof a different behaviour. Although it is not demonstrated in this chapter, similar trends were \n\nobserved for other steel grades. \n\n4.6 New design curve \n\nBased on the parametric study performed in section 4.5, new design curves are proposed in \n\nthis section. The improvements of using this new proposal in comparison to the actual design \n\ncurve given in Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 are also here demonstrated. The new design curves \n\nare dependent on the effective section factor (see subsection 4.5.1) and on the steel grade \n\n(see subsection 4.5.4), which were the main parameters influencing the lateral-torsional \n\nbuckling behaviour of beams with slender cross-sections at elevated temperatures. As stated \n\nbefore, the influence of the steel grade was already taken into account in EN 1993-1-2 in the \n\ndefinition of the imperfection factor, using parameter 235 / yfH   (see equation (4.5)). \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\nF L\nT\n\n,f\ni\n\nOLT,T\n\nEN 1993-1-2 S355\n\nh/b > 2\n\nh/b &lt;2\n\nLT,?O\n\n, , 0.9eff y el yW W !\n(S355)\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n128 \n\nThe proposed expressions are based on the actual design curve of Part 1-2 of Eurocode, \n\ngiven by equations (4.3) \u2013 (4.8) but considering \n\n 2, ,new , ,0 ,0.5 1 ( )LT LT LT LT LTT T TI D O O O\u00aa \u00ba ? ? ?\u00ac \u00bc  (4.17) \n\nwith the values of , newLTD  and ,0LTO  given in Table 4.4.

It is observed from this comparison that results are less scattered \n\nwhen using the new proposal, especially for slenderness , 1.0LT TO d , meaning that there is \n\ncloser agreement between the numerical results and the proposal for the simplified design \n\nmethod. On the other hand, a large number of results for slenderness around , 1.0LT TO |  lay \n\non the unsafe side for the EN 1993-1-2 design curve. As observed in Figure 4.21 and  \n\nFigure 4.22, these are mainly Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections with an effective section \n\nfactor tending towards the unity, i.e. are less prone to local buckling, this is corrected by \n\nconsidering curve L1 which is more conservative than that of EN 1993-1-2.

Beams \n\n133 \n\n4.7 Non-uniform bending diagrams \n\nIn this section, beams submitted to non-uniform bending diagrams are studied. The \n\nnumerical model described in section 4.3 was used and cross-section 450\u00d74+150\u00d7tf was \n\nconsidered. In this section, it was not possible to study the common case corresponding to a \n\npoint load applied at mid-span due to web-buckling and other local phenomena that was \n\nobserved prior to global instability. For this case, web stiffeners could have been considered \n\nto address this issue but such assumptions were out of the scope of this research programme. \n\nFor the same reason, the distributed load case was modelled using nodal forces applied at \n\nthe lower flange. Additionally, the numerical results where failure of the beams was mainly \n\ndue to shear stresses were disregarded. \n\nThe inclusion of the factor \u201cf\u201d to take into account different loading cases on the lateral-\n\ntorsional buckling response of the beams in case of fire was proposed in [4.8, 4.30] for  \n\nClass 1 and 2 beams. The applicability of the formulae to Class 3 and 4 beams is investigated \n\nhere. Accordingly, the factor \u201cf\u201d is defined as \n\n ? ?1 0.5 1 cf k ? ?   (4.18) \n\nwhere ck  is a correction factor according to Table 4.5. \n\nTable 4.5: Correction factors ck . \n\nMoment distribution ck  \nM                            M\\  \n\n \n11 d\\d?  \n\n215.03.06.0 \\?\\?  \n\nbut 1dck  \n\n \n0.91 \n\n \n0.90 \n\n \n0.91 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n134 \n\nMoment distribution ck  \n\n \n0.79 \n\n \n0.73 \n\n \n0.75 \n\nNote: for others bending diagrams 1 ck . \n\nFinally, the reduction factor to take lateral-torsional buckling into account is calculated as  \n\n ,, , mod\nLT fi\n\nLT fi f\nF\n\nF   (4.19) \n\n4.7.1 Uniformly distributed load \n\nIn Figure 4.26, the results for uniformly distributed load are depicted for the different curves \n\nproposed (L1-L3) and considering the factor \u201cf\u201d In this figure, the \u201cNew proposal (L# + f)\u201d \n\ncurve denotes the one corresponding to the calculation of , , modLT fiF  according to  \n\nequation (4.19) with the factor \u201cf\u201d given in equation (4.18). \n\n \na) Cross-sections with , , 0.8eff y el yW W d . \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\nF L\nT\n\n,f\ni\n\nTitle\n\nNew proposal (Curve L1 - S355)\nNew proposal (L1 + f)\n350\u00b0C\n450\u00b0C\n550\u00b0C\n700\u00b0C\n\nLT,?OLT,?OLT,?O\n\ndistributed load\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4.

As it was demonstrated in section 4.7.2, this proposal is not adequate \n\nfor bi-triangular bending diagram ( 1\\  ? ). Finally, considering a limitation on the  \n\nfactor f t 0.8 (case iii), gives an average value of 0.90 with just 4.80% unsafe results and a \n\nmaximum of 1.07, thus it is concluded that this proposal could be used to design beams with \n\nslender cross-sections submitted to non-uniform bending diagram in fire situation. \n\n4.9 Conclusions \n\nIn this study, the behaviour of beams with slender cross-sections subjected to uniform \n\nbending moment was investigated with finite element analysis software SAFIR in case of \n\nfire. Shell finite elements were used and several Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections, as well \n\nas different temperatures and different steel grades were considered. In the first instance, it \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4. Beams \n\n143 \n\nwas observed that the actual fire design rules of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 for checking the \n\nlateral-torsional buckling resistance of beams with slender cross-sections could be improved. \n\nIt was demonstrated that using the current methodology to calculate the cross-sectional \n\nresistance at elevated temperatures to check the LTB resistance of beams in case of fire \n\naccording to Part 1-2 leads to inaccurate results. The comparison to FEA carried out in \n\nSAFIR, demonstrated that for small slenderness ranges of the beams the resistance was over \n\npredicted for Class 3 cross-sections and underestimated for Class 4 cross-sections. The \n\nmethodology developed in Chapter 3 to calculate the cross-sectional capacity of Class 3 and \n\nClass 4 cross-sections was then used to check the accuracy of the existing beam design rule \n\nand improvements were noticed. Nonetheless, it was observed that the actual simplified \n\nmethodology of EN 1993-1-2 could be improved to better account with the specific \n\nbehaviour of beams with slender cross-sections. \n\nA parametric study was performed to investigate the influence of several parameters on the \n\nLTB resistance of beams with slender cross-sections, namely the effective cross-section ratio \n\n, ,eff y el yW W , the temperature, the residual stresses, the steel grade and the depth-to-width \n\nratio. From the studied parameters, it was found that the beam resistance depends on the \n\neffective ratio of the cross-section. Therefore, an effective section factor was proposed for \n\nthis ratio , ,eff y el ys W W  and different ranges were defined according to the influence of the \n\nlocal buckling on the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of beams: i) for , , 0.8eff y el yW W d  \n\nit is high; ii) For , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d  it is moderate and iii) for , , 0.9eff y el yW W !  it is \n\nsmall.  \n\nFinally, a proposal for a new design curve including the effective section factor was proposed \n\nand validated against numerical results. The new proposal allows for better prediction of the \n\ncapacity of beams with slender cross-sections against lateral-torsional buckling in case of \n\nfire. Additionally, for non-uniform bending diagrams, it was concluded that the factor \u201cf\u201d \n\ncould be used together with the new proposal to account with the effect of the loading case \n\nproviding that this factor is limited to f t 0.8. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n144 \n\nReferences \n\n[4.1] Bailey C., Burgess I., Plank R., \u201cThe Lateral-torsional Buckling of Unrestrained Steel \n\nBeams in Fire,\u201d Journal of Constructional Steel Research, vol. 36, no. 2,  \n\npp. 101\u2013119, 1996. \n\n[4.2] Vila Real P., Franssen J.-M., \u201cNumerical modeling of lateral-torsional buckling of \n\nsteel I-Beams under fire conditions - Comparison with eurocode 3,\u201d Journal of Fire \n\nProtection Engineering, 2001. \n\n[4.3] CEN, \u201cEN 1993-1-2, Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures - Part 1-2: General  \n\nrules - Structural fire design.\u201d European Committee for Standardisation,  \n\nBrussels, Belgium, 2005. \n\n[4.4] Vila Real P.

The accuracy of the simplified methods stated in Part 1-2 of \n\nEurocode 3 is analysed and its safety level is determined. More than 6000 numerical simulations \n\nhave been carried out, considering in-plane and out-of-plane buckling, several member lengths, \n\ndifferent temperatures as well as different bending moment diagram and load ratios. Local and global \n\ngeometrical imperfections as well as residual stresses have been considered in the numerical \n\nsimulations. It was possible to conclude that the interaction curve of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 is \n\ninconsistent for the in-plane direction giving both unsafe and very conservative results. For the out-\n\nof-plane direction, the interaction curve demonstrated to be very conservative mainly because the \n\nreduction factor for the lateral-torsional buckling is too severe for bending diagrams other than that \n\nof uniform bending. Regarding the accuracy of the interaction factors predicted by the formulae, \n\nmodifications are proposed in this work that lead to reduction of the number of unsafe results. Finally, \n\na new proposal for the interaction curve is presented according to the developments in this thesis and \n\nits accuracy and validity is demonstrated by comparison to the numerical results. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5. Beam-columns \n\n151 \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nThe structural elements subjected to axial compression and bending are normally designated \n\nas beam-columns. For beam-columns at normal temperature, two methods exist in Part 1-1 \n\nof the Eurocode 3 [5.1], to evaluate the safety of the members resulting from the work of \n\ntwo different groups in the framework of the European convention for constructional \n\nsteelwork (ECCS) Technical Committee 8 (TC8 \u2013 Stability). The two methods called the \n\n\u201cLevel 1\u201d and \u201cLevel 2\u201d beam-column interaction formulae [5.2\u20135.4] replaced the beam-\n\ncolumn interaction formulae present in the previous ENV version of the Eurocode 3  \n\nPart 1-1 [5.5] that proven to be very conservative.  \n\nIn case of fire, Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3 [5.6] adopts the same format as the ENV version \n\nmaking the necessary modifications to account for the yield stress and the modulus of \n\nelasticity values at high temperatures. The buckling reduction factors for flexural buckling \n\nand Lateral Torsional Buckling (LTB) in fire were also included and when LTB is prevented, \n\nthe beam-column interaction curves are the results from the studies of Talamona  \n\net al. [5.7, 5.8]. Numerical studies carried out by Vila Real et al. [5.9, 5.10],  \n\nLopes et al. [5.11] and Knobloch et al. [5.12] evaluated the safety and accuracy of the current \n\nmethods available in the EN1993-1-1 adapted to elevated temperatures for the fire design of \n\nbeam-columns and concluded that additional changes had to be made in order to use them. \n\nSeveral researches were then conducted to investigate the influence of different parameters \n\non the behaviour of steel beam-columns in fire. Experimental investigations of Kodur and \n\nDwaikat [5.13], conducted on beams that behave as beam-columns due to the compressive \n\nforces originated from the thermal restraint allowed to conclude that the fire scenario, load \n\nlevel, degree of end-restraint and high-temperature creep have significant influence on the \n\nbehaviour of beams under fire conditions. Dwaikat et al. [5.14] investigated beam-columns \n\nthat develop a thermal gradient through their depth when exposed to fire and conclude that \n\nthe plastic resistance to combinations of axial load and moment was also affected by the \n\nthermal gradients influencing the location of the most critical section. Quiel et al. [5.15] \n\nevaluated the adequacy of different methodologies to predict the capacity and response \n\ncaused by non-uniform thermal gradients through the depth of beam\u2013columns. A simplified \n\napproach to predict the axial and moment capacity is made by Dwaikat and Kodur in [5.16] \n\nfor the cases where a thermal gradient is developed. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n152 \n\nHowever, in these studies, local buckling was not covered. In the numerical investigations \n\nbeam-finite elements were used which do not capture the plate instability and therefore only \n\nClass 1 or 2 cross-sections were analysed. In the experimental investigation, local buckling \n\nwas out of the scope of the aforementioned studies. Consequently, the behaviour of Class 4 \n\nmembers submitted to combined moment and axial loads has not yet been studied at elevated \n\ntemperatures and the safety and accuracy of the existing rules of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 has \n\nnot yet been established. It is unclear how the interaction between flexural buckling and \n\nlateral torsional buckling together with local buckling affects the load bearing capacity of \n\nthe members in case of fire. \n\nThis chapter presents a numerical study of the behaviour of steel I-shaped Class 4 beam-\n\ncolumns subjected to combined axial and in-plane bending moment under fire conditions. A \n\nparametric study at elevated temperatures was done using shell finite elements with the \n\nsoftware SAFIR [5.17, 5.18] by performing geometrically and materially nonlinear analyses \n\nwith imperfections included (GMNIA). Several member lengths, cross-section geometries \n\nand different axial and bending moment ratio with and without lateral displacements allowed \n\n(restriction to out-of-plane displacements). A comparison of the obtained numerical results \n\nand the interaction curves of EN1993-1-2 show that for members with Class 4 cross-sections \n\nthe existing formulae are safe and conservative. Mainly because the existing design curves \n\nfor beams and columns with Class 4 cross-sections need to be improved. It is demonstrated \n\nthat new interaction curves can be used based on the numerical results leading to a safer and \n\neconomic design of steel I-shaped profiles with Class 4 cross-section at elevated \n\ntemperatures, on the assumption that the design curves for beams and columns are correctly \n\ncalibrated.  \n\n5.2 The code provisions of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 \n\nAccording to Part 1-2 of EC3 [5.6], the design buckling resistance at time t for a member \n\nwithout lateral restraints and with a Class 4 cross section subject to combined bending and \n\naxial compression in fire situation should be verified by satisfying the interaction curve \n\ndefined by equations (5.1a) and (5.1b) for doubly symmetric cross-sections. These are the \n\nequations (4.21c) and (4.21d) respectively of Part 1-2 of EC3 adapted for Class 4, i.e., \n\nconsidering the effective cross-sectional properties. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5.

Next, the used numerical model is described. In 5.3.2 the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5. Beam-columns \n\n155 \n\ngeometric and material imperfections used are referred and in 5.3.3 the cases that have been \n\nstudied are presented. \n\n5.3.1 Numeric model \n\nThe beam-columns were discretized into several quadrangular shell elements with four \n\nnodes with six degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations) each. In SAFIR, these \n\nshell elements adopt the Kirchoff\u2019s theory formulation with a total co-rotational description. \n\nThe material law is a two-dimensional constitutive relation with the von Mises yield surface. \n\nThe integration on the shell element follows a Gauss scheme with 2 \u00d7 2 points on the surface \n\nand 4 points through the thickness. Since shell elements are used, the root fillet of the cross-\n\nsections has been disregarded in all the models. The shell finite element used in SAFIR and \n\nits ability to model local buckling has been validated by Talamona and Franssen [5.19, 5.20]. \n\nAfter a sensitivity analysis a mesh with 10 shell elements for the flange, 22 shell elements \n\nfor the web and 100 shell elements along the length has been used. For the beam-columns \n\nwith a span higher than 10 m the divisions on the length were doubled. The loads were \n\napplied to the model by means of nodal forces and to prevent numerical problems end-plates \n\nhave been used. The so-called \u201cfork-support\u201d conditions have been considered in the model \n\nby restraining vertical displacements of the bottom flange and the out-of-the plane horizontal \n\ndisplacements of the web in the extremities of the beam as well as the rotation about the \n\nbeam axis. \n\n5.3.2 Geometric and material imperfections \n\nThe geometric imperfections have been introduced in the model by changing the node \n\ncoordinates to represent the worst scenario for the assessment of beam-column resistance. \n\nThis has been considered as the shape given by the eigenmodes of a linear buckling analysis \n\n(LBA) performed with the software Cast3M [5.21]. A tool was written in order to automate \n\nthis process resulting in the software RUBY [5.22]. In accordance with the finite element \n\nmethod of analysis recommendations given in the Annex C of EN1993-1-5 [5.23], a \n\ncombination of global and local modes (see Figure 5.1) has been used, where the lower mode \n\nhas been taken as the leading imperfection and the other one reduced to 70%. The amplitude \n\nof the imperfections has been chosen as 80% of the fabrication tolerances given in the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n156 \n\nEN1090-2 [5.24], as suggested in the same annex [5.23]. Consequently, the global mode has \n\nbeen scaled to 80% of L/750 and the local mode has been scaled either to 80% of b/100 if \n\nthe maximum node displacement (in respect to the local mode) occurs in the flange or  \n\nto 80% of hw/100 if the maximum node displacement occurs in the web, whereas b is the \n\nflange width and hw is the height of the web of the cross-section. \n\n \n\n \nglobal mode (out-of-plane) global mode (in-plane) \n\n \n\n \nlocal mode \n\nFigure 5.1: Buckling modes in a laterally unrestrained steel beam-column with Class 4 cross-\n\nsection subjected to in-plane bending moment. \n\nAt elevated temperature, the effect of the residual stresses is small [5.25, 5.26]. In this study, \n\nonly the residual stress diagram [5.27] that corresponds to welded cross-sections has been \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5. Beam-columns \n\n157 \n\nused as depicted in Figure 4.4. The values adopted for the residual stresses are according to \n\n[5.27, 5.28] as used in a previous study [5.29]. \n\nFigure 5.2: Pattern of the residual stresses considered in this study for welded profiles. \n\n5.3.3 Cases studied \n\nDifferent Class 4 cross-sections, member lengths, temperatures and ratios between the \n\napplied axial compression and bending moment were considered as shown in Table 5.2. The \n\nsteel grade considered was the S355. The temperature was considered constant in the cross-\n\nsection and along the member to allow direct comparison with the simplified methods of the \n\nPart 1-2 of Eurocode 3. Different moment distribution was also considered, with end-\n\nmoments and distributed load. Two directions of buckling have been considered, the minor-\n\naxis buckling was considered as out-of-plane buckling and the buckling in the major-axis \n\nwas considered as in-plane buckling. Since in the studied cases the web was slender  \n\n(Class 4), it was not possible to study the common case corresponding to a point load applied \n\nat mid-span due to web-buckling and other local phenomena that was observed prior to \n\nglobal instability and being out of the scope of this research programme. The same was \n\nobserved regarding the location of the application of the distributed load and it was only \n\npossible to investigate the case corresponding to the load applied in the lower flange. To \n\nstudy the other cases stiffeners to avoid local buckling would be needed and it was out of \n\nthe scope of this study. \n\n \n\nfy\n\n0.25 fy\n\nT\nC\n\nT\n\nT\n\nC\n\nC\n\n0.25b\n\n0.15b\n\n0.075hw0.125hw fy\n\n0.25 fy\n\nb\n\nh\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n158 \n\nTable 5.2: Summary of the cases analysed (steel grade S355). \n\nCross-section \n(hw \u00d7 tw + b \u00d7 tf) \n(mm) \n\nNon-dimensional \nslenderness \n\n \n\nLoad ratios \nE  (*) \n\nMoment \ndistribution \n\nTemperature Ta  \n(\u00baC) \n\n450\u00d74+150\u00d75 \n\ny, {0.5,1.0,1.5}TO   \n \n\n, {0.5,1.0,1.5, 2.25}z TO  \n\n0.2; 0.4; 0.6; \n0.8; \n\n(plus only \naxial force \nand only \nbending \n\nmoment)** \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n350, 450,  \n550, 650 \n\n450\u00d74+150\u00d77 \n450\u00d74+150\u00d710 \n450\u00d74+250\u00d75 \n450\u00d74+250\u00d76 \n450\u00d74+250\u00d712 \n450\u00d75+250\u00d716 \n1000\u00d75+300\u00d710 \n1000\u00d75+300\u00d715 \n1000\u00d77+300\u00d712 \n1000\u00d78+300\u00d720 \n\n* The ratio between the applied loads was defined as , , , , , ,/  (1 ) / (  / )fi Ed y fi Ed y fi Rd fi RdN M M NE E ?   \n\n** For the in-plane cases (bending about y-y), an additional ratio of 0.9 was also considered. \n\n5.4 Results \n\nComparison between the results obtained numerically and using the predicted capacity of \n\nthe interaction curves in equations (5.1a) and (5.1b) are presented here.

In these figures, \n\nthe line corresponding to the value 1 in the vertical axis defines the interaction curve. If the \n\npoints, which represent the numerical results, are below the line it means the ultimate loads \n\nobtained numerically are below those predicted by equation (5.1a) and therefore are unsafe \n\nand safe otherwise. \n\n \nFigure 5.4: Comparison of interaction curve and the numerical cases studied for the in-plane \n\nbehaviour in terms of non-dimensional slenderness. \n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nct\n\nio\nn \n\ncu\nrv\n\ne \n(E\n\nN\n19\n\n93\n-1\n\n-2\n)\n\nad\n\n350\u00baC 450\u00baC 550\u00baC 650\u00baC\n\nSAFE\n\nUNSAFE\n\ny,?O\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n160 \n\n \nFigure 5.5: Comparison of interaction curve and the numerical cases studied for the in-plane \n\nbehaviour in terms of the applied bending moment. \n\nIt is observed that the results are inconsistent with both unsafe and very conservative results \n\nobtained. Two reasons for this are pointed out: i) the reduction factor for the in-plane column \n\nbuckling ,y fiF  calculated according to EN1993-1-2 demonstrates to be too severe for some \n\ncases and unsafe for others (see Figure 5.6) and ii) the interaction factor yk  calculated \n\naccording to equation (5.2) depends on the factor yP  calculated with equation (5.3) that \n\ngives unsafe results for the bi-triangular bending diagram ( 1\\  ? ) as later shown  \n\nin section 5.4.2. \n\n \nFigure 5.6: Comparison of the reduction factor for the column behaviour obtained numerically and \n\naccording to EN1993-1-2. \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n\nIn\nte\n\nra\nct\n\nio\nn \n\ncu\nrv\n\ne \n(E\n\nN\n19\n\n93\n-1\n\n-2\n)\n\nM/Mfi,Rd\n\n350\u00baC 450\u00baC 550\u00baC 650\u00baC\n\nSAFE\n\nUNSAFE\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\nF y\n,fi\n\ne\n\nEN 1993-1-2 S355\n\n350\u00baC\n\n450\u00baC\n\n550\u00baC\n\n650\u00baC\n\ny,?O\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5.

Beam-columns \n\n175 \n\n5.5 Statistical evaluation \n\nTable 5.3 presents the statistical results for the beam-columns in fire situation for the various \n\nmethods and both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. More than 3000 numerical \n\nsimulations were considered for each direction. For each methodology, the mean value P  \n\nand the standard deviation s  of the numerical results were calculated from: \n\n 1\n\nn\n\ni\ni\n\nx\n\nn\nP   \n\n\u00a6\n (5.14) \n\n \n? ?2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nn\n\ni\ni\n\nx\ns\n\nn\n\nP\n \n\n?\n \n\n?\n\n\u00a6\n (5.15) \n\nwhere for each methodology, ix  is given according to equations (5.1a) and (5.1b) for in-\n\nplane or out-of-plane direction. Since in these expressions the ultimate loads obtained in \n\nSAFIR were considered as the design loads, a value higher than 1.0 yield a safe results. \n\nAccordingly, the maximum unsafe result is the maximum deviation obtained with  \n\nequations (5.1a) and (5.1b). In this table, it is also indicated the percentage of unsafe results. \n\nFor the EN1993-1-2 method, it can be seen that the standard deviation is high in both \n\ndirections, with a considerable number of results unsafe for the in-plane buckling direction. \n\nIn what concerns unsafe results in the in-plane direction, it was observed to be due to the \n\nEN1993-1-2 column design curve being slightly unsafe for some results (see Figure 5.6) and \n\nthe expression for yP  not being adequate for bi-triangular bending diagram (see 5.4.2). For \n\nthe out-of-plane direction, the column design curve (see Figure 5.15) and beam design curve \n\n(see Figure 5.16) are mainly over-conservative in comparison to the numerical results, \n\nespecially for the beam cases with triangular and bi-triangular bending diagrams, this leads \n\nto over-conservative results for the interaction curve with an average value of 1.29. For the \n\nmethodologies where the reduction factors were calculated numerically (denoted \n\n\u201ccalibrated\u201d) it is observed that the standard deviation is reduced, but the number of unsafe \n\nresults also increases (from 25.72% to 29.14% for the in-plane direction and from 0.56%  \n\nto 14.82% for the out-of-plane direction).

For the in-plane direction, the average value \n\nincreased 4% (from 1.13 to 1.17) but the standard deviation and the maximum unsafe result \n\ndecreased, from 15.72% to 13.94% and from 0.81 to 0.89 respectively. For the out-of-plane \n\ndirection, the improvements obtained with the new proposal are less noticeable, with the \n\naverage decreasing from 1.31 to 1.28 and the maximum unsafe results from 0.97 to 0.91. \n\nNonetheless, the proposals made in this thesis revealed to be safe and accurate when \n\ncompared to the numerical results for the determination of the buckling resistance of slender \n\nbeam-columns in case of fire. \n\n5.7 Conclusions \n\nIn this chapter, the behaviour of beam-columns with Class 4 cross-section is investigated \n\nnumerically. The accuracy of the existing interaction formulae of EN 1993-1-2 was \n\nanalysed. The methodology of EN1993-1-2 is based on an interaction curve that can be \n\ndivided into in-plane and out-of-plane direction. According to the obtained numeric results, \n\nthis interaction curve proved to be very conservative for the out-of-plane direction but \n\ninconsistent for the in-plane direction. The main reason for this, is that for both cases it \n\ndepends on the reduction factor for the column behaviour ( ,y fiF  and ,z fiF ) with the formulae \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5. Beam-columns \n\n179 \n\navailable in the EN 1993-1-2 for their calculation being conservative. However, for the \n\nparticular case of in-plane direction with bi-triangular bending moment ( 1\\  ? ) some \n\nunsafe results were observed for low slenderness of the member. Additionally, for the out-\n\nof-plane direction, lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) is accounted for by the appropriate \n\nreduction factor, LT, fiF , which revealed to be very conservative, especially for the cases \n\nwhere the member is submitted to triangular and bi-triangular bending moment diagrams, \n\n0\\   and 1\\  ? , respectively. This has an accountable influence on the safety level of the \n\ninteraction curve for the out-of-plane situation making it very conservative. In both cases, it \n\nis undeniable that the formulation of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 to calculate the beam-columns \n\nin case of fire will benefit from improved design rules for columns and beams.  \n\nIn this chapter, the safety level of the interaction factors preconized in the beam-column \n\nformulae of EN1993-1-2 was also investigated removing the scatter associated with the \n\nreduction factors ,y fiF , ,z fiF  and LT, fiF  by calculating them numerically. From the results of \n\nnumerical investigation, it was observed that for beam-columns submitted to bi-triangular \n\nbending moments ( 1\\  ? ), the current interaction factor lead to some unsafe results for \n\nboth directions. Based on the same methodology used for the calibration of these factors \n\nwhen they were established in Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3, a new proposal has been made. These \n\nmodifications allowed the reduction of the number of unsafe results while maintaining the \n\nsame level of accuracy of the interaction curve. \n\nFinally, it was presented the formulation of the interaction curve accounting with the \n\ndevelopments in this thesis for the cross-section resistance (Chapter 3) and considering the \n\nLT, fiF  calculated as in Chapter 4. The formulation proved to be safe and accurate for \n\ndetermining the resistance of beam-columns with slender cross-sections submitted to \n\ncombine axial compression and bending about the major-axis in case of fire when compared \n\nto numerical results.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n180 \n\nReferences \n\n[5.1] CEN, \u201cEN 1993-1-1, Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures - Part 1-1: General rules \n\nand rules for buildings.\u201d European Committee for Standardisation, Brussels, 2005. \n\n[5.2] Greiner R., \u201cBackground information on the beam-column interaction formulae at \n\nLevel 1.

To conclude, future developments and research guidelines \n\nare delineated and discussed. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6. Conclusions \n\n185 \n\n6.1 General description of the work developed \n\nThe work done in this thesis aimed at the development of simplified design rules for steel \n\nmembers with H or I shape Class 4 cross-section in case of fire, with special focus on beams \n\nand beams-columns. \n\nFirst the accuracy of the existing fire design rules given in the informative Annex E of  \n\nPart 1-2 of Eurocode 3 [6.1] for members with Class 4 cross-sections were investigated. In \n\nChapter 2, it was concluded that using the proposed methodology of Eurocode 3 to deal with \n\nClass 4 cross-sections, namely using the effective width method given in Part 1-5 of \n\nEurocode 3 [6.2] with a reduced design value of the steel yield strength (corresponding  \n\nto 0.2% proof strength) leads to inaccurate determination of the ultimate buckling strength \n\nof thin plates in case of fire. In Chapter 3, the capacity of Class 4 cross-sections was \n\ninvestigated and it was concluded that the Eurocode 3 method was underestimating the \n\nresistance of the cross-sections mainly because the additional reserve of resistance provided \n\nby non-Class 4 plates is not accounted for by the current methodology. Additionally, it was \n\nconcluded from these two chapters that local buckling may occur prior to the full \n\ndevelopment of axial plastic resistance or elastic bending resistance, thus Class 3 cross-\n\nsections were also investigated and treated as if they were prone to local buckling.  \n\nChapters 4 and 5 deal with the behaviour of beams and beam-columns respectively with \n\nslender (Class 3 and 4) cross-sections. It was concluded that the design provisions of \n\nEurocode 3 for beams and beam-columns, were mainly conservative. The current simple \n\ndesign methods of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 were developed for Class 1 and 2 cross-sections \n\nand, when applied to Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections demonstrated to be inadequate and \n\nthat it could be improved. \n\nThe need of improved design rules for members with Class 3 and 4 cross-sections is implicit, \n\nand was addressed throughout this work and a contribute for better fire design of members \n\nwith slender cross-sections was presented. In Chapter 2 analytical expressions that allow for \n\na closer prediction of the ultimate strength of thin-plates were developed and then used in \n\nChapter 3 to provide a methodology to calculate the cross-sectional capacity in case of fire. \n\nThis new methodology was later used to assess the accuracy of the existing design rules for \n\nbeam and beams-columns and also as the basis for the development of new formulae. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n186 \n\nIn Chapter 4, for beams with slender cross-sections, new curves for the design against lateral-\n\ntorsional buckling were proposed, these expressions account with the influence of the \n\ninteraction between the lateral-torsional buckling and the local buckling trough a parameter \n\ndenominated as the effective section factor. The imperfection factor normally used in the \n\nlateral-torsional buckling design formulae was calibrated and defined as a function of the \n\neffective section factor and a plateau was also introduced into the design formulae.  \n\nBeam-columns with slender cross-sections were studied in Chapter 5. The failure in strong-\n\naxis (designated in this document as in-plane buckling) and the weak-axis (designated as \n\nout-of-plane buckling) was investigated. Although conservative results were obtained, a \n\ngood fit between numerical results and the Eurocode 3 interaction curve was generally \n\nobserved, the reason be that the reduction factors to account with the column behaviour \n\n(flexural buckling) and the beam behaviour (lateral-torsional buckling) are conservative and \n\ninfluence the accuracy of the beam-column interaction curve. If this accumulated error is \n\neliminated, good correlation is obtained between the numerical results and the interaction \n\nformulae. Nonetheless, for the in-plane case, however, the numerical results were slightly \n\nunsafe for beam-columns submitted to bi-triangular bending diagram ( 1\\  ? ) and so a \n\nmodification to the interaction factors was proposed to account with this difference. \n\nThe particular conclusions and remarks for each chapter of the thesis are addressed in the \n\nnext sections. \n\n6.2 Chapter 2 \u2013 Plates \n\nIn Chapter 2 the behaviour at elevated temperatures of individual thin steel plates that form \n\nthe slender cross-sections was addressed. The influence of local buckling in the ultimate load \n\nbearing capacity of the plates in case of fire was investigated by performing several analyses \n\nbased on shell finite elements. \n\nAt normal temperature, it was concluded that the numerical results obtained with shell finite \n\nelements do fit well on the existing design expressions given in Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3 [6.2] \n\nto calculate the effective width of the plates and thus the ultimate resistance of the plates, \n\nexcept for the internal elements under compression. In this case, the design expressions may \n\nhave been defined considering a less severe geometrical imperfection than that currently \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6. Conclusions \n\n187 \n\nrecommended by Part 2 of EN 1090 [6.3]. This may lead to inaccurate estimation of the \n\ncross-sectional capacity at normal temperature and further studies should be done to confirm \n\nthis. \n\nIn case of fire, as mentioned, the Eurocode 3 recommends for Class 4 plates the same \n\nequations as for normal temperature to calculate the effective width of the plates and  \n\nthe 0.2% proof strength as the design yield strength to assess their capacity. Good agreement \n\nwith the numerical results was achieved with this method, however, for plates with lower \n\nnon-dimensional slenderness, especially in the range of Class 3, the Eurocode 3 failed to \n\npredict the ultimate strength of these plates. Consequently, this leads to overestimation of \n\nthe capacity of Class 3 cross-sections as observed in Chapter 3. On the other hand, \n\nconsidering a different yield stress for steel demonstrated to have impact on the cross-\n\nsectional capacity as seen in Chapter 4: the non-Class 4 plates provide additional resistance \n\nto the cross-section which is not accounted for by the current methodology of Eurocode 3, \n\nleading to the underestimation of the cross-sectional capacity.  \n\nIn this chapter, expressions for the effective width method to account for the local buckling \n\nat elevated temperatures were developed. These new expressions enable for the calculation \n\nof the effective cross-section properties and resistance using the strength at a total strain  \n\nof 2% as the steel design yield stress as done for the other classes. This lead to a better \n\nagreement between FEA results and the expressions to calculate the cross-sectional \n\nresistance in Chapter 3. \n\nThe new expressions are temperature dependant resulting in a variation of the effective \n\ncross-section properties under fire situation and although the method herein proposed can be \n\nimplemented with relatively ease of computational effort if compared with the actual design \n\nrules, it was also demonstrated that the proposal corresponding to a constant steel \n\ntemperature of 700\u00baa CT   could be used as the lower bound for the effective properties In \n\nChapter 3, this simplification was further developed in order to have a consistent and simple \n\ndesign methodology to calculate the cross-sectional resistance. \n\nSome remarks are noticed here. First it was observed that the geometric imperfections have \n\na considerable influence on the ultimate resistance of the plates and in this case imperfections \n\nwere considered according to EN 1090-2 [6.3] by following the recommendations of  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n188 \n\nPart 1-5 of Eurocode 3, thus other values of geometrical imperfection amplitude may lead to \n\ndistinct behaviour and should be investigated. The second remark is related to the \n\ntemperature distribution that was considered uniform. In this case, non-uniform distribution \n\nof temperatures may have a non-negligible influence in the ultimate capacity of the plates \n\nand could be addressed in the future. As a final remark on this chapter, although these \n\nexpressions were developed for simply supported plates considered separately, other \n\nsupports and loading conditions could have been considered, in theory, by an appropriate \n\nplate buckling factor. The most interesting part would have been to take into account with \n\nthe interaction between the plates, as for instance, Seif and Schafer [6.4] have made, by \n\ndeveloping expressions to calculate the plate buckling factor for several hot-rolled cross-\n\nsections. These principles in the future could be extended as well as to consider non-uniform \n\ntemperature distributions within the cross-section which was not covered in this thesis.  \n\nTo conclude, the expressions developed within this chapter allow for a better prediction of \n\nthe ultimate capacity of thin-plates at elevated temperature and thus provide a better solution \n\nto account for local buckling in case of fire. \n\n6.3 Chapter 3 \u2013 Cross-sections \n\nIn Chapter 3, the resistance of several cross-sections where local buckling can occur under \n\naxial compression and bending about the major-axis was investigated at elevated \n\ntemperatures using shell finite elements. The expressions to calculate the effective width in \n\ncase of fire developed in the previous chapter (Chapter 2) were used in the definition of a \n\nnew methodology to calculate the cross-sectional capacity of sections prone to local buckling \n\nin case of fire. \n\nAs noted in the previous section, the actual provisions of Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 to calculate \n\nthe cross-sectional resistance leads to simultaneous to very conservative and to unsafe results \n\nwhen compared to the numerical results. Three reasons were highlighted in this chapter. \n\nFirst, the effect of the temperature on the local buckling at elevated temperatures is not \n\ncorrectly taken into account when considering the effective properties determined based on \n\nthe material properties at normal temperature. Secondly, local buckling occurs prior to what \n\nis currently assumed especially for Class 3 cross-sections. Third, considering the 0.2 % proof \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6. Conclusions \n\n189 \n\nstrength as the design yield strength, for the whole cross-section is restrictive if the cross-\n\nsection has non-Class 4 elements. \n\nTo overcome these limitations, a new methodology to calculate the resistance of cross-\n\nsections with local buckling at elevated temperatures was defined in this chapter based on \n\nthe effective width expressions at elevated temperatures developed in Chapter 2. \n\nAccordingly, the influence of local buckling in the decrease of resistance in case of fire is \n\nbetter taken into account. It was concluded that using the effective cross-section determined \n\nwith those expressions and the strength at a total 2% strain \u2013 ,yf T , as the design yield strength \n\nwhen calculating the capacity of slender cross-sections, the additional resistance provided \n\nby the plates that do not have local buckling is considered, leading to an economic yet safe \n\ndesign. On the other hand, it was shown that by calculating an effective cross-section for \n\nClass 3 cross-sections at elevated temperatures that the decrease of resistance due to local \n\nbuckling is also accounted for in these cases. The possibility of considering these cross-\n\nsections as Class 4, and to study the modifications to limits used in the classification of the \n\ncross-sections could be addressed in the future and was not covered in this work. \n\nIn this chapter, only H and I shape cross-sections were investigated and regarding the \n\nbending direction only bending in strong-axis was considered. As mentioned in the previous \n\nsection, the expressions developed in Chapter 2 to calculate the effective width are not \n\nlimited to H and I shape cross-sections but, nonetheless, their validity should be confirmed \n\nand the work done in this chapter be extended to square and rectangular cross-sections. In \n\nterms of bending in the weak-axis, in Chapter 2 outstand plates submitted to bending were \n\nnot investigated and that should be covered in the future.  \n\nFinally and to conclude, for sake of simplicity, two proposals were presented in this chapter \n\nto calculate slender cross-section\u2019s resistance in case of fire: a more complex yet rigorous \n\napproach which is temperature dependent, meaning that an effective cross-section has to be \n\ndetermined for each temperature, and a simplified proposal that does not depend on the \n\ntemperature and enables prompt calculations yet safe and accurate. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n190 \n\n6.4 Chapter 4 \u2013 Beams \n\nIn this chapter, the behaviour of laterally unrestrained beams with slender cross-sections was \n\ninvestigated. The aim was to study existing design provisions of Eurocode 3 to check the \n\nlateral-torsional buckling in case of fire and to develop improved design methods. \n\nFirst, the actual provisions of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 for checking the lateral-torsional \n\nbuckling resistance of beams with slender cross-sections were analysed. It was demonstrated \n\nthat inaccurate results were obtained mainly due to the cross-sectional capacity being \n\ninconsistently calculated. This was in line with the previous chapters of the thesis, and by \n\nusing the methodology developed in Chapter 3 to calculate the cross-section capacity \n\nimprovements were observed. \n\nNonetheless, in this chapter an improved design method was developed. For that purpose, \n\nseveral parameters were investigated in order to attain their influence on the lateral-torsional \n\nbuckling of beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. It was found that the capacity \n\nof the beams was mainly influenced by the interaction between the local buckling and the \n\nlateral-torsional buckling and that it depended on the steel grade as well. For the first, an \n\neffective section factor was proposed for this ratio , ,eff y el ys W W  and different ranges were \n\ndefined according to the influence of the local buckling on the lateral-torsional buckling \n\nresistance of beams: i) for , , 0.8eff y el yW W d  it is high; ii) for , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d  it is \n\nmoderate and iii) for , , 0.9eff y el yW W !  it is small. In respect to the steel grade, the proposed \n\ndesign method accounts with this influence through the parameter H which was already the \ncase in the current design formulae of Eurocode 3.  \n\nIn terms of the interaction between local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling, the \n\nproposed philosophy of dealing with such a complex subject by grouping the behaviour of \n\nbeams into several ranges of effective section factor must be subject to some considerations. \n\nThis factor is somehow analogous to the depth-to-width (h/b) ratio on the formulae at room \n\ntemperature. In that case, The depth h/b ratio of a cross-section is used in Part 1-1 of \n\nEurocode 3 to group the properties of the sections and take into account a variety of factors \n\nsuch as the torsional stiffness or the critical behaviour in plasticity as pointed out in [6.5]. In \n\nthe future, this interaction could be further investigated and developed and at best have an \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6. Conclusions \n\n191 \n\neffective section factor that is dependent on other variables such as the second moment of \n\narea in the strong-axis and weak-axis (Iy and Iz, respectively) that lead to better allowance \n\nfor the interaction between local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling. \n\nIn the final part of the chapter, the proposal was also compared with the use of the factor \u201cf\u201d \n\nto take into account different loading cases. This factor was originally developed for  \n\nClass 1 and 2 beams and demonstrated to be rather accurate for beams submitted to uniform \n\ndistributed loads and triangular bending moments ( 0\\  ). For the bi-triangular case  \n\n( 1\\  ? ) it was observed that the original proposal for the factor \u201cf\u201d lead to some unsafe \n\nresults and a lower bound of 0.8f t  was proposed leading to better agreement between the \n\nresults and the simplified design methods. A remark on this subject should be made, further \n\ninvestigation should be developed in order to understand better the influence of the loading \n\non the capacity of beams with slender cross-sections. The case where the shear stress is \n\nhigher and constant on the beam ( 1\\  ? ) is the one that leads to higher discrepancy between \n\nthe original proposal for factor \u201cf\u201d. Since cross-sections with slender webs are considered \n\nhere, the interaction between the shear stresses and the bending moment may not be \n\nnegligible and needs to be analysed in more detail. Also, for the bi-triangular case, only \n\n1\\  ?  has been considered and a limitation is proposed for 0.8f t . The 0.8 value \n\ncorresponds to the factor \u201cf\u201d for 0\\  . The practical implications of using this limit is that \n\nfor bi-triangular bending moments ( 0\\ ? ) the factor \u201cf\u201d remains unchanged and this may \n\nbe too conservative for some situations. \n\nFinally it was concluded that the new proposal developed in this chapter allows for better \n\nprediction of the capacity of beams with slender cross-sections against lateral-torsional \n\nbuckling in case of fire. \n\n6.5 Chapter 5 \u2013 Beam-Columns \n\nThis chapter focused on the behaviour of beam-columns with slender cross-section. A \n\nnumerical investigation using shell finite elements was performed to evaluate the accuracy \n\nof existing interaction formulae of Eurocode 3. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n192 \n\nThe actual methodology of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 to check the resistance of members \n\nsubmitted to combine axial compression with bending in case of fire is based on an \n\ninteraction curve that can be separated into in-plane and out-of-plane direction. For both \n\ndirections, this methodology proved to be unreliable: for the in-plane direction (buckling in \n\nthe strong-axis) both very conservative and unsafe results were obtained. For the first, the \n\nreason for such results is that the reduction factor for the column behaviour \u2013 ,y fiF  \u2013 provided \n\nin Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 is already conservative in some cases and has a favourable \n\ninfluence on the interaction curve. For the latter, it was observed that the interaction factor \n\nwhen the beam-column is submitted to bi-triangular moments loading case ( 1\\  ? ) was \n\nnot adequate and lead to some unsafe results. This behaviour is in accordance with what was \n\nobtained in Chapter 4 for the beams: for the cases where the shear stresses are more important \n\nthe resistance deviates more from the existing design methodologies. The interaction \n\nbetween the shear stresses and bending moments was not exploited in this thesis because it \n\nwas out of the scope of the present research programme, however this subject should be \n\naddressed in the future and better formulae to take into account with this phenomenon should \n\nalso improve the proposals made within this thesis. For the out-of-plane direction, the \n\ninteraction curve also relies on the calculation of the reduction factor for the lateral-torsional \n\nbuckling (LTB) which demonstrated in Chapter 4 to be very conservative especially for the \n\ncases where the member is submitted to triangular and bi-triangular bending moment \n\ndiagrams, 0\\   and 1\\  ? . This has an accountable influence on the safety level of the \n\ninteraction curve for the out-of-plane situation, making it very conservative. Consequently, \n\nit was concluded that for both directions, the formulation of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 to \n\ncalculate the beam-columns in case of fire could benefit with improved design rules for \n\ncolumns and beams. \n\nIn accordance with the last statement, in this chapter, the safety level of the current \n\ninteraction curve was also analysed but considering the reduction factors ,y fiF , ,z fiF  and \n\nLT, fiF  obtained numerically. This allowed to observe that for beam-columns submitted to bi-\n\ntriangular bending moments ( 1\\  ? ), that the current interaction factor lead to some unsafe \n\nresults for both directions. Based on the same methodology used for the calibration of these \n\nfactors [6.6] when they were established in Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3, a new proposal has been \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6. Conclusions \n\n193 \n\nmade. These modifications allowed the reduction of the number of unsafe results while \n\nmaintaining the same level of accuracy of the interaction curve. \n\nThis chapter contains also the formulation of a proposal for the interaction curve according \n\nto the developments of this thesis to check the buckling resistance of slender beam-columns \n\nsubmitted to combined axial compression and bending in the major-axis at elevated \n\ntemperatures. It was conclude that this proposal leads to conservative results for the cases \n\nstudied. \n\n6.6 Future developments \n\nAs any research study, the present work is delimited in a time period. Several questions were \n\nleft open in the present document. Although some general remarks have been highlighted in \n\nthe previous section of the current chapter, here some guidelines for further work are \n\ndescribed. \n\nThe subject of cross-section classification in case of fire should be further investigated. \n\nThe developments on this thesis demonstrated that cross-sections with Class 3 were also \n\nprone to local buckling and it was suggested that an effective cross-section should be \n\ncalculated also for these types of cross-sections. However, it could be studied the \n\nmodifications for the classification limits for the cross-sections and the effective cross-\n\nsection be determined only for Class 4 cross-sections. \n\nThe existing design provisions of Eurocode 3 recommend a critical temperature of 350\u00b0C to \n\nbe considered if no additional calculation is performed to assess the resistance of the \n\nmembers with Class 4 cross-section. Following the research conducted in this thesis and the \n\nnew design methods developed, investigation towards a higher prescribed temperature \n\ncould be proposed and compared against numerical results. \n\nCross-sections with different shape, the proposed methods developed in this thesis were \n\nbased mainly on I and H shape cross-sections. Numerical investigations considering other \n\nshapes of cross-sections, namely rectangular and square hollow sections could be addressed \n\nin the future. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section \n\n194 \n\nThe interaction between shear force and bending moment may influence the response of \n\nmembers with slender cross-section. Although the proposals made within this thesis may \n\naccount with this influence, for instance in the limitation of the \u201cf\u201d factor for bi-triangular \n\nbending diagram ( 1\\  ? , see Chapter 4), further investigation should address this matter in \n\nthe future. \n\nThe effect of non-uniform temperature, should be seen as a future improvement on the \n\ncurrent proposals. It is unclear how the non-uniform temperature distribution along the \n\nplates, the cross-sections and the members affect the conclusions in this work. It is assumed \n\nthat considering a constant temperature along the cross-section is the worst scenario for \n\nassessing the capacity of the members in case of fire so it is foreseen that a non-uniform \n\ntemperature distribution may have a favourable influence that could be accounted for in the \n\ndesign formulae. \n\nFinally, the proposed methods to design beams against lateral-torsional buckling could \n\nbe extended to room temperature design. Following the same methodology used within \n\nthis thesis, the development of a methodology to account with the interaction between local \n\nbuckling and lateral-torsional buckling by means of an effective section factor at room \n\ntemperature is possible. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6.
