Tais rochas formam \n\nextensos corpos tabulares com dezenas de metros de espessura, sobrepondo-se aos derrames bas\u00e1lticos \n\ncorrelatos. Classificam-se como traquidacitos pobres em s\u00edlica (63-66% SiO2). A textura porfir\u00edtica \n\ncaracteriza-se por 10 - 20% de macrocristais de plagiocl\u00e1sio, pirox\u00eanio (augita, principalmente) e \n\n\u00f3xidos de Fe-Ti, em ordem decrescente de abund\u00e2ncia; imersos em uma matriz microgranular a \n\nafan\u00edtica. Em escala de afloramento, os traquidacitos possuem um padr\u00e3o zebrado, alternando bandas \n\nsinuosas claras e escuras dispostas de maneira sub-horizontal. Ves\u00edculas e am\u00eddalas, apesar de pouco \n\nabundantes, s\u00e3o recorrentes. Macrocristais de plagiocl\u00e1sio foram amplamente investigados do ponto \n\nde vista petrogr\u00e1fico e isot\u00f3pico. Tais cristais caracterizam-se por h\u00e1bitos tabulares euedrais atingindo \n\ncomprimentos de at\u00e9 2 cm. Menos comuns, mas presentes, s\u00e3o agregados deste mineral com pirox\u00eanio \n\ne \u00f3xidos de Fe-Ti, definindo textura glomeroporfir\u00edtica. Neste caso, o plagiocl\u00e1sio ocorre em menores \n\ntamanhos, com formas irregulares e contatos interdigitados. Independente da associa\u00e7\u00e3o petrogr\u00e1fica, \n\no plagiocl\u00e1sio \u00e9 predominantemente homog\u00eaneo, com aus\u00eancia de zoneamentos. Imagens de \n\ncatodoluminesc\u00eancia e microscopia eletr\u00f4nica de varredura em matriz de traquidacito revelaram que \n\nesta \u00e9 composta por dois dom\u00ednios petrograficamente distintos; um cont\u00ednuo e maci\u00e7o caracterizado \n\npor um fino intercrescimento de sanidina e quartzo, e outro irregular e esburacado dominado apenas \n\npor sanidina. As bandas escuras observadas nos respectivos afloramentos s\u00e3o enriquecidas no \n\nprimeiro, enquanto as bandas claras s\u00e3o relativamente empobrecidas neste e dominadas pelo segundo \n\ntipo. Todas amostras apresentaram curvas crystal size distribution (CSD) c\u00f4ncavas para cima, \n\npossibilitando sua subdivis\u00e3o em fenocristais (> 3mm) e microfenocristais (&lt;3mm). Tal divis\u00e3o \n\nguarda rela\u00e7\u00e3o com o per\u00edodo de resid\u00eancia e ambiente de cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, estimados da ordem de 40 \n\nanos em c\u00e2mara magm\u00e1tica profunda (taxa de crescimento de 10\n-9\n\n mm.s\n-1\n\n), e 2 anos durante ascens\u00e3o \n\ne erup\u00e7\u00e3o (taxa de crescimento de 10\n-8\n\n mm.s\n-1\n\n), respectivamente. Assinaturas de is\u00f3topos de Sr em \n\nplagiocl\u00e1sio revelam sutis flutua\u00e7\u00f5es intra e intercristalinas das raz\u00f5es de \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr, com m\u00e9dia de \n\n0.70566 \u00b1 0.00004 (2?). Tais raz\u00f5es de \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr em plagiocl\u00e1sio sobrep\u00f5em-se \u00e0s de rocha total, \n\ncondizente com uma cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o em equil\u00edbrio e sua classifica\u00e7\u00e3o como fenocristais sensu stricto. As \n\naltas temperaturas dos magmas traquidac\u00edticos (~1000\u00b0C) associadas aos cristais sinuosos de \n\nplagiocl\u00e1sio nos agregados e \u00e0s curvas CSD c\u00f4ncavas para cima indicam relevante a\u00e7\u00e3o de coarsening \n\ndurante est\u00e1gio de c\u00e2mara magm\u00e1tica. A limitada varia\u00e7\u00e3o de is\u00f3topos de Sr obtida em plagiocl\u00e1sio \n\nsugere sua cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o em uma c\u00e2mara magm\u00e1tica com cont\u00ednua inje\u00e7\u00e3o de magmas cogen\u00e9ticos \n\ncapazes de interagir e homogeneizar todo o ambiente. Tais eventos de inje\u00e7\u00e3o magm\u00e1tica causaram \n\n\n\n \n\nII \n \n\nrompimento e remobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de partes das paredes da c\u00e2mara, redistribuindo os fragmentos \n\ncumul\u00e1ticos, posteriormente preservados como os agregados (clusters). Tal magma ascendeu pela \n\ncrosta com 10-15% de cristalinidade. As baix\u00edssimas quantidades de \u00e1gua dissolvidas (<1.5% H2O) \n\nforam exsolvidas apenas em profundidades muito rasas at\u00e9 a superf\u00edcie. Tal exsolu\u00e7\u00e3o magm\u00e1tica \n\nocorreu de maneira heterog\u00eanea, gerando zonas discretas com reologias e propriedades diferentes \n\nnuma escala centim\u00e9trica. Fraturas sub-horizontais finamente espa\u00e7adas condicionadas pela dire\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nfluxo e pelo padr\u00e3o de resfriamento possibilitaram o escape de tais fluidos, que teriam interagido \n\nseletivamente com as por\u00e7\u00f5es imediatamente pr\u00f3ximas, gerando as diferentes cores observadas nos \n\nafloramentos bandados. Rela\u00e7\u00f5es estratigr\u00e1ficas, aus\u00eancia de texturas/estruturas pirocl\u00e1sticas, \n\nimponente presen\u00e7a de cristais euedrais de plagiocl\u00e1sio e homogeneidade isot\u00f3pica associadas \u00e0s \n\nbaixas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1gua e altas temperaturas magm\u00e1ticas refutam uma origem pirocl\u00e1stica para \n\ntais dep\u00f3sitos. Sugere-se um modelo eruptivo predominantemente efusivo na forma de extensos \n\nderrames de lavas \u00e1cidas a partir de condutos na regi\u00e3o de Guarapuava.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIII \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\n \n\nAcid volcanic rocks of Chapec\u00f3 affinity crops out on the surroundings of Guarapuava city (Paran\u00e1, \n\nBrazil) associated with the Eocretaceous magmatism of the Serra Geral Formation. Such rocks \n\nconstitute extensive tabular deposits up to tens of meters thick, resting directly above the correlate \n\nbasaltic flows. They classify as low-silica trachydacites (63-66% SiO2). Their porphyritic texture is \n\ncharacterized by 10-20% of macrocrysts of plagioclase, pyroxene (augite, chiefly) and Fe-Ti oxides, in \n\ndecreasing order of abundance; these are set in a microgranular fine to aphanytic groundmass. \n\nTrachydacite outcrops show a zebra-like pattern characterized by a rhythmic alternation of sub-\n\nhorizontal light and dark bands in a sub-horizontal fashion. Vesicles and amygdales, although rare, are \n\nubiquitous in these outcrops. Plagioclase macrocrysts were thoroughly investigated via petrography \n\nand isotopy. Crystals typically exhibit tabular euhedral habits up to 2 cm long. Less frequent, but \n\nubiquitous, are clusters composed of plagioclase + pyroxene \u00b1 Fe-Ti oxides, that define a \n\nglomeroporphyritic texture. In this case, plagioclase is smaller and show irregular, interfingered \n\ncontacts. Regardless of the petrographic association, the plagioclase is predominantly unzoned. \n\nCathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscopy reveal the trachydacite groundmass to be \n\ncomposed of two petrographically distinct domains; one massive and continuous composed of a fine \n\nintergrowth of sanidine and quartz, and another one irregular and porous dominated only by sanidine. \n\nThe dark bands observed on the respective outcrops are enriched in the former, whereas the light \n\nbands are relatively depleted in this and dominated by the latter type.  All samples show concave-up \n\ncrystal size distribution (CSD) curves, allowing sub-division in two groups: phenocrysts (> 3mm) and \n\nmicrophenocrysts (&lt;3mm). Such division bears relation with residence times and crystallization \n\nenvironment, estimated about 40 years in a deep-seated magmatic chamber (growth rate of 10\n-9\n\n mm.s\n-\n\n1\n) and 2 years during ascent and eruption (growth rate of 10\n\n-8\n mm.s\n\n-1\n), respectively. Plagioclase Sr \n\nisotopes signatures reveal subtle intra and intercrystalline fluctuations in \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios with a mean \n\nvalue of 0.70566 \u00b1 0.00004 (2?). These signatures overlap with the whole-rock Sr isotopes, implying \n\nequilibrium crystallization and their classification as phenocrysts sensu stricto.  The high magmatic \n\ntemperatures of trachydacite magmas (~1000\u00b0C) associated with the irregular plagioclase crystals in \n\nthe clusters and the concave-up CSD curves indicate the importance of coarsening during the \n\nmagmatic chamber stage. The restricted variation of Sr isotopes obtained in plagioclase suggest their \n\ncrystallization in a magmatic chamber protractedly supplied by cogenetic magmas capable to interact \n\nand homogenize the entire environment. These injection events promoted disruption and \n\nremobilization of parts of the chamber walls, redistributing the observed cumulate fragments that form \n\nthe glomerocrysts. The magmas ascended through the crust bearing 10-15% crystallinity. The very \n\n\n\n \n\nIV \n \n\nlow water contents dissolved (&lt;1.5% H2O) were exsolved in very shallow depths up to the surface. \n\nSuch exsolution was heterogeneous through the magma, generating discrete zones with different \n\nrheology and properties up to the centimeter scale. Finely spaced sub-horizontal fractures enabled the \n\nexsolved fluids to escape and these would have interacted selectively with the immediately adjacent \n\nportions, generating the different colors observed on the banded outcrops. Stratigraphic relationships \n\ntogether with the lack of pyroclastic textures/structures, ubiquitous presence of euhedral plagioclase \n\ncrystals and isotopic homogeneity associated with the low water contents and high magmatic \n\ntemperatures refutes a pyroclastic origin for such deposits. Otherwise, it is suggested a mainly effusive \n\neruption style as vast acid lava flows fed by discrete conduits on the neighborhoods of Guarapuava. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nV \n \n\nAGRADECIMENTOS \n\n \n\n \n\nNingu\u00e9m conquista nada e nem chega a lugar algum sozinho.

\n\nCONTINENTAL FLOOD BASALTS: A BRIEF REVIEW AND INSIGHTS INTO THE \n\nPARAN\u00c1-ETENDEKA MAGMATIC PROVINCE \n\nSince the seminal papers of Wilson (1963, 1965) about ocean island chains and plate \n\nmovements, a great effort has been demanded on hot-spots. Morgan (1972) suggested that hot-spots \n\nare surface expressions of deep mantle plumes; hot upwelling solid material ascending through the \n\nmantle that remain relatively stationary whilst tectonic plates ride over and are stippled by volcanic \n\nislands and forming a track along its path, the Hawaiian islands the most conspicuous example. The \n\nsame author warned about the apparent link between giant basaltic provinces on continents with the \n\nopening of ocean basins. Later, White &amp; Mckenzie (1989) proposed that the volcanism on rift zones is \n\ntriggered by a combination of temperature rise and decompression in the upper mantle induced by \n\nplumes. This rift-related volcanism is potentially preserved along passive margins following \n\ncontinental breakup and ocean opening. In the same year, Richards et al. (1989) assigned the earliest \n\nbasaltic volcanism over continental hot-spots to the melting of a plume \u201chead\u201d which is eventually \n\nfollowed by the opening of an ocean basin, with a continuing magmatism tracking linear and \n\nsymmetric submarine chains on both sides of the new tectonic plates by the melting of a plume \u201ctail\u201d. \n\nDespite the lack of compulsory of continental breakup, it normally follows basaltic floods being a \n\nnatural consequence of the plume influence. This seeming connection between plumes, volcanism and \n\ncontinental splitting was further endorsed (e.g. Hill; 1991; White &amp; Mckenzie, 1995; Courtillot et al., \n\n1999). Noting the worldwide occurrence of huge basaltic provinces of different ages, Coffin &amp; \n\nEldholm (1992, 1993,1994) proposed the collective term Large Igneous Provinces (LIP) to describe \n\nvery intense and short-lived volcanic events not related to subduction zones. A more strict definition \n\nof LIP was suggested by Bryan &amp; Ernst (2008) as giant intraplate magma volumes (>0.1 MKm\n3\n), \n\nmostly basaltic, erupted in geological short time intervals &lt;50 m.y., usually much less. Continental \n\nFlood Basalts (CFB) and Ocean Plateaus are the equivalents of LIPs on continental and oceanic crust, \n\nrespectively.  \n\nThere are many well-preserved CFBs around the world, chiefly the Mesozoic ones. The breaking of \n\nGondwana and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Early Cretaceous is linked with one of the \n\nlargest CFBs preserved in the world, widespread on South America and, to a lesser extent, on the \n\nAfrican counterpart, in Namibia (Bryan et al. 2010). Once continuous, this CFB is known as the \n\nParan\u00e1-Etendeka Magmatic Province (PEMP) (Peate, 1997). Both sides of the PEMP seem to have a \n\nbathymetric continuity into the ocean by linear and symmetric submarine chains in latitudes between \n\n25\u00b0 and 35\u00b0S, the Walvis Ridge on the African Plate and the Rio Grande Rise on the South American \n\nPlate; which come together on the active volcanic island of Tristan da Cunha, located close to the \n\nSouth Atlantic mid-ocean ridge. The clear progressive aging of the respective chains away from \n\nTristan da Cunha island (e.g. O\u2019Connor et al., 2012;  O\u2019Connor &amp; Jokat, 2015; Rohde et al., 2013), \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nmeeting the ages of the continental PEMP (e.g. Renne et al., 1992, 1996; Thiede &amp; Vasconcelos, \n\n2010), enables us to trace back the plates configurations and infer similarities in the magmatic history \n\nfor both on- and off-land volcanism. A reasonable assumption is the presence of a major mantle plume \n\nbeneath the Tristan da Cunha Island responsible for the onset of the PEMP magmatism on continents \n\nand followed by the ocean floors (O\u2019Connor &amp; Duncan, 1990; Hawkesworth et al., 1992). Recent \n\nupper mantle tomography confirms the existence of a plume beneath Tristan da Cunha Island, but the \n\nshallow depths of the low velocity zone, with a main conduit extending about 250 Km and branching \n\ndownwards, puts doubt on the deep-seated origin of the plume, otherwise indicating that it is dying out \n\n(Schlomer et al., 2017). \n\nIn this context, it is discussed the genesis and relative contributions of potential distinct sources to \n\nthe PEMP. Gibson (1995; 1999; 2005) and Ewart et al. (1998) suggested that the PEMP basalts reflect \n\na main deep asthenospheric source, the Tristan da Cunha plume in the case. However, Hawkesworth et \n\nal. (1988), Peate et al. (1999), Marques (1999) proposes the PEMP basalts are products of \n\nheterogeneous melts with a substantial sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) contribution. \n\nCombining geoid and seismic tomography data, Ernesto et al. (2002) advocated for a non-plume \n\nmodel related to the PEMP magmatism. Rocha-J\u00fanior et al. (2012) showed that the exclusive melting \n\nof either asthenosphere or SCLM cannot satisfactorily explain the overall geochemical and isotopic \n\nfeatures of the PEMP. Using Re-Os isotopy combined with highly siderophile elements, the latter \n\nauthors attributed the PEMP generation to the partial melting of a metassomatized asthenosphere \n\nfollowed by variable mixing with enriched mantle portions, probably in the SCLM. In this model, the \n\nregionally distinct basalts in the PEMP are products of different amounts of mixing with these \n\nenriched mantle components. The same authors points to notable isotopic differences between the \n\nPEMP basalts and ocean islands along the Tristan da Cunha track, indicating a minor role of the \n\nplume. Recent geophysical investigation points to a high-density lithosphere underlying the PMP, \n\nattributed to a highly altered and fertile lithosphere (Chaves et al., 2016). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nBRYAN, S.

The CSD enables direct \n\nassessment of residence timescales of crystallization without the necessity of further sophisticated \n\nthermodynamic approaches.  \n\nThe CSD theory is based on a crystal population balance that relates the change in the number of \n\ncrystals whilst these nucleate and grow in a liquid environment (Marsh, 1988). This equation reports \n\nthe change of the number and size of crystals as a function of their respective magmatic residence \n\ntimes and inflow and outflow of the size intervals. Such balance requires a parameter that determines \n\nthe number of crystals within a specific size range in a particular volume of rock/magma, called \n\npopulation density (n; mm\n-4\n\n)   \n\nAccording to Cashman &amp; Marsh (1988), in summary, the balance equation of a population of \n\ngrowing crystals in a steady-state system within a specific size range (dL) can be described as: \n\n(1) d(Gn)/dL = -n/  \n\n \n\nwhere G is the linear growth rate of the crystal (mm.s\n-1\n\n) and  is the residence time (s). Assuming G \n\nas constant, equation (1) can be integrated to:  \n\n \n\n(2) n = n\n0\n exp (-L/G ) \n\n(3) ln (n) = ln (n\n0\n) - (1/G ) L  \n\nIn which n\n0\n is a constant that represents the population density at the moment that crystals size \n\napproach zero (L?0), or the nucleation density. A diagram relating ln(n) and L of a system following \n\nsuch requirements is shown in Figure 1a. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. A) Representation of a typical CSD graph. B) Examples of different CSD curves and their respective \n\ninterpretations. Line a (red): Straight CSD formed by purely kinetic reasons in a steady-state crystallizing igneous system. \n\nLine b: Concave-up CSD along the smaller crystal sizes caused by a rapid cooling in the system. Line c: Concave-up CSD \n\nalong the larger crystal sizes promoted by crystal accumulation. Line d: Concave-down CSD along the smaller crystal sizes \n\ninduced by crystal removal. C) Keeping the residence time constant the CSDs are displaced parallel by changing their \n\nnucleation density. D) Otherwise, keeping the nucleation density constant, the CSD slopes change according to different \n\nresidence times (the quicker the crystallization interval, the steeper the CSD). Image withdrawn from Higgins (2006). \n\nFrom Figure 1a we conclude that (1) The slope of the CSD curve is inversely proportional to G  \n\n(2) The intersection of the CSD with the y axis is equivalent to the nucleation density, n\n0\n (L?0).  \n\nHowever, natural CSDs are rather curved than straight (Fig. 1b). Higgins (2006) attributed this to \n\nadditional mechanical processes (ex: crystal removal and accumulation, compaction, magma mixing, \n\nmingling, and others) and kinetic effects (ex: rapid undercooling) operating during and even post-\n\ncrystallization (ex: coarsening). The participation of these mechanisms that are able to deviate the \n\nCSD from the predicted straight line are likely to be recorded by the different shapes of the CSD \n\ncurves (Fig. 1b). The evaluation of the CSD from a set of samples reveals trends on the nucleation \n\ndensity (Fig. 1c) and residence time (Fig. 1d) and, consequently, on the crystallization pathways.  \n\nCSD curves requires the tridimensional knowledge of the crystals sizes. However, this is not an \n\neasy task due to the difficulty in isolating the individual crystals from their hosting rocks. This \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nproblem can be circumvented by an indirect approach in which intersection planes (petrographic thin \n\nsections, rocks slabs, outcrop surfaces) are investigated to obtain morphological parameters of the \n\ncrystals (length, area, shape, orientation; Figure 2a). These two-dimensional data are converted to \n\nthree dimensions via stereology corrections (e.g. Sahagian &amp; Proussevitch, 1998). Other methods also \n\npermit assessment of crystal parameters (serial sectioning and tomography, for example), however, \n\nstereology is easier, faster, and cheaper than these ones and was preferred for this study.    \n\n \n\nFigure 2. A) Parallelepiped representing a natural crystal. Ideally, the volume of the parallelepiped encloses the crystal. The \n\nintersection   of this shape with a random plane gives an intersection area (grey area). B) CSD graph displaying the method \n\ndeveloped by Higgins (2000) in which the crystals are distributed along specific size ranges (bins) with different widths. The \n\nbins are progressively wider in order to compensate the underrepresentation of the larger crystals in bi-dimensional sections. \n\nThus, the CSD graph is a histogram in which the center of the bins are connected by a simple line. Both images were \n\nwithdrawn from Higgins (2000).     \n\nHiggins (2000) developed an algorithm, which performs crystal stereology in natural rocks, \n\nCSDCorrections Program. The analyzed crystals are approximated to rectangular parallelepipeds with \n\nthree perpendicular axis, long : intermediate : short (Fig. 2a). This ratio must be defined by empirical \n\nobservations in the intersection planes and informed to the program for stereological conversion. \n\nCrystals are then divided in different size ranges that are progressively wider in order to compensate \n\nthe underrepresentation of larger crystals in the intersection planes (Fig. 2b). The horizontal axis of the \n\nCSD graph, size (mm), refers to the long axis of the bestfit ellipses enclosing the parallelepipeds.    \n\n \n\n2 Cathodoluminescence \n\nThe interaction of a solid phase with a focused beam of electrons promotes ionization of the \n\nformer and produces a set of products (Pagel et al., 2000): 1) Characteristic X-ray emission from the \n\ninner layers of the atoms 2) A continuous radiation 3) High and low energy electron scattering 4) \n\nElectrons ejected from the outer layers of the atoms (Auger electrons) and 5) Cathodoluminescence \n\n(CL). The CL is characterized by photons with large wavelengths, from the ultraviolet to the visible \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nspectra and infrared. The latter is activated by a series of trace elements (rare earth elements REE, \n\nactinides and transition elements, chiefly) present in specific crystal sites. The excited valence \n\nelectrons generates a photon with specific wavelength when these return to their original positions. \n\nSuch phenomenon is observed as different CL colors. These colors are a function of the respective \n\nactivator element, valence state, and crystal site among others.       \n\nIn this study, polished thin sections of selected samples were investigated under cold CL. In this \n\nmethod, electrons are produced by applying an electrical charge between two electrodes under low gas \n\npressure (Pagel et al., 2000). The main advantages of the cold CL are the possibility coupling it to an \n\noptical microscope and the relatively simple vacuum system, which combined permits the observation \n\nof large fields without need of carbon coating. However, the wide electron beam implies an inferior \n\nspatial resolution relatively to the hot CL. The cold CL images in this study were obtained at the \n\nUniversit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi (Canada) under analytical conditions of 10 Kv and electrical \n\ncurrent of 185 \u00b5\u00c5.   \n\n \n\n3 Powder X-ray Diffraction   \n\nThe X-ray diffraction is a physical phenomenon embracing a series of departures of wave \n\npaths after hitting the crystalline structure of solid phases in mono or polycrystalline aggregates. This \n\nis possible due to the size equivalency between the X-rays wavelength (0.1 to 100 \u00c5) and the spacing \n\nbetween interatomic planes.  \n\nThe crystalline structure of any solid (sensu stricto) consists of a regular array of atoms that repeat \n\nthemselves three dimensionally. This array results in atomic planes with different orientations, \n\nspacing, and densities (Figure 3a). The atoms promote X-rays scattering, which, in special conditions, \n\nwill interact constructively and produce a peak of intensity in an X-ray diffraction graph.    \n\n \n\nFigure 3. A) Bi-dimensional example of a set of atomic planes (thin straight lines) spaced by d. The atoms (black balls) \n\ndiffract the incident X-rays according the Bragg\u2019s law. B) Sketch representing how a typical diffractometer operates.  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nThe geometric relationships between the X-rays incident angle and the spacing of the atomic planes \n\nare described by the Bragg\u2019s law: \n\n(4) n? = 2 d sen? \n\nin which n is an integer number, ? is the X-ray wavelength, d is the spacing between the atomic planes \n\nand ? is the incident angle (Figure 3a). The constructive diffraction pattern will only occur in \n\nparticular incident angles. In polycrystalline aggregates, like rock powder, the sample must be \n\nprepared in a way to ensure the random disposition of their particles. Following this premise, for each \n\nset of atomic planes, a small but important number of particles will be oriented in an optimal angle \n\nfavorable to diffract the X-rays and promote a peak intensity. Multiple peaks from the same phase and \n\nother ones will be displayed in the same graph and can be overlapped depending on the phases present. \n\nThe identification of each phase is performed by direct comparison with an X-ray diffraction database \n\n(e.g. CIF; Crystallographic Information File) and by considering the geological context and rock \n\ncomposition.  \n\nIn most cases, the X-rays source is a tube containing a cathode and an anode under vacuum. The \n\nelectrons emitted by the cathode are accelerated under 30-60 Kv and collide with the anode, producing \n\nthe X-rays. These leave the tube by a small beryl window. As they hit the sample, the diffracted rays \n\nproduced by this interaction are captured in the opposite symmetrical detector. This set moves slowly \n\nby increasing gradually the incident and diffracted angles (Figure 3b). The rock powders used in the \n\nX-ray diffraction analyzes in this study were obtained following the same procedure described in item \n\n1. \n\n4 Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) \n\nFollowing Sylvester (2008), the LA-ICP-MS is used for in-situ elemental and/or isotopic \n\nanalyzes of minerals and matrices (glass, fine grained groundmass).  The technique does not requires \n\npowdering on the sample, and permits textural control of the analyzed spots by using standard \n\npolished section. The LA-ICP-MS is made of three distinct portions represented in the acronym. The \n\nfirst, laser ablation (LA), performs the microsampling of the polished section by a laser beam up to a \n\nfew hundreds \u00b5m in diameter. Once the laser beam hits the sample, the latter is pulverized and \n\ntransformed into an aerosol composed of very fine particles. This aerosol is transported through a gas, \n\ncommonly Ar, up to the next stage, the ion coupled plasma (ICP), where the aerosol interacts with an \n\nextremely hot plasma made by a mixture of Ar and He. The sample is vaporized and converted to \n\nionized atoms. These ions are accelerated to the last part of the equipment, the mass spectrometer \n\n(MS) that operates under vacuum conditions. Once in the MS, a magnetic field applied to the ions \n\nforces them to follow different curved pathways depending on the mass to charge ratio of the deflected \n\nions. A range of voltages can be applied in order to record from the lightest (e.g. Li\n+\n) to the heaviest \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n(e.g. U\n+\n) ions. The   frequency of the ionic impacts (counts per second, cps) on the detectors are \n\ntranslated in electric pulses or potential (voltage) which are recorded in a computer. The absolute \n\ncontents of the respective elements are obtained by comparing the acquired signals to the ones of an \n\ninternal standard determined independently. The detector possesses many possible configurations used \n\nfor different applications. The specific configuration used in this work is described next. \n\n4.1 Multi-Collector \n\nThe multi-collector has a configuration that allows simultaneous measurements of several \n\nmasses. The employed system has 12 Faraday cups and 5 ion counters that can be moved to detect \n\nspecific isotopes of interest. This was the configuration used to measure the Sr isotopic ratios in the \n\nplagioclase crystals. Such analyzes were performed in two stages. One at the Radiogenic Isotope \n\nFacility (RIF, University of Alberta, Canada) in 2009 (sample FP-15-15), and another at the MidWest \n\nIsotope and Trace Element Research Analytical Center (MITERAC) of the University of Notre Dame \n\nin 2017 (samples PA-16-01 and -21). The analyzes at RIF were conducted using a NuPlasma MC-ICP-\n\nMS coupled with a Laser Ablation system UP213 under analytical conditions of laser beam diameter \n\nof 160 \u00b5m and 10 Hz frequency and output energy of approximately 11 J/cm\n3\n. Otherwise, the analyzes \n\nat MITERAC were conducted with a NuPlasma II MC-ICP-MS coupled with an Excimer NWR-193 \n\nnm LA system, under analytical conditions of laser beam diameter of 150 \u00b5m and 10 Hz frequency \n\nand output energy of approximately 14 J/cm\n3\n.    \n\n5 Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM) \n\nIn this method, the interaction of a geological material with a focused electron beam produces \n\nsignals that translate into composition, morphology, and topography of the target. The SEM combines \n\nsuch phenomenon with the possibility of investigation under high magnification, which allows \n\nidentification and imaging of nanometric phases and textures. In this study, SEM analyzes were \n\nperformed at the Laborat\u00f3rio de Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica (LCT - EPUSP) of the Escola Polit\u00e9cnica \n\nof the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, using a Quanta 600 FEG (FEI) coupled with an energy dispersive \n\nspectrometer (EDS; Quantax, Bruker). Phase association was characterized from backscattered \n\nimages, EDS and digital mapping by X-rays for major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Na, K, Ca, Ti, P). The \n\nSEM analyzes were conducted in order to investigate the banded structure of the studied acid rocks.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n6 References \n\n \n\nHIGGINS, M. D.

Although mainly composed by basalts, CFBs commonly have minor contributions of \n\nintermediate and acid rocks.  \n\nBrazil hosts one of the world\u2019s most expressive continental flood basalts (CFB) associated to the \n\nbreakup of the Gondwana Supercontinent and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Paran\u00e1-Etendeka \n\nMagmatic Province (PEMP) holds up to 5 x 10\n5\n km\n\n3 \nof tholeiitic basalts exposed over an area about 1 \n\nmillion km\n2\n  (Frank et al., 2009). This huge volume of lava is believed to have outpoured to surface in \n\nless than 4 M.y. (Renne et al., 1992, 1996, Pinto et al., 2011; Janasi et al., 2011; Thiede and \n\nVasconcelos, 2010; Baksi, 2017), which in geological terms is almost instantaneous. \n\nKnowledge about the province has increased in the last years thanks to systematic studies on the \n\nvolcanic stratigraphy and eruptive style (Nardy et al., 2002, 2008; Polo et al., 2017;  Rossetti et al., \n\n2017).  However, several key questions remain unanswered, especially those concerning the time it \n\ntook for each individual flow to extrude to the surface, the characteristics of the hidden reservoir that \n\nfed the volcanic system, and the physical properties and the volatile budget of the magmas that form \n\nthe PEMP. \n\nThe study of crystals might help answering some of these questions, since accurate in situ Sr \n\nanalyzes are now routine in many laboratories (e.g. Davidson et al., 2007; Ramos &amp; Tepley, 2008). \n\nVolcanic phenocrysts are archives of the chemical and physical evolution of a magma from the \n\nchamber stage through the ascent and eruption moment. Plagioclase, in particular, has gained \n\nincreased attention due to several reasons: (1) it is present over most of the crystallization interval in \n\ntypical magmatic systems; (2) it is stable over a wide range of crustal T, P, aH2O and melt \n\ncomposition; (3) its chemical and isotopic composition might register subtle changes in intensive \n\nvariables, which might help to elucidate magmatic processes; (4) the very slow coupled diffusion of \n\nCaAl-NaSi prevents plagioclase homogenization and favors preservation of distinct An-content zones \n\n(Grove et al., 1984); and (5) different shapes and sizes of plagioclase reflect distinct thermal and \n\nkinetic regimes operating during crystallization (e.g. Lofgren, 1974; Swanson, 1977; Kirkpatrick, \n\n1979). Thus, plagioclase textural and chemical variations have been widely used to reconstruct \n\nchamber dynamics, petrological processes and emplacement style from many volcanic provinces (e.g. \n\nAnderson, 1984; Nixon &amp; Pearce, 1987; Singer et al., 1995; Davidson &amp; Tepley, 1997; Tepley et al., \n\n2000; Ginibre et al., 2002; Browne et al., 2006; Humphreys et al., 2006; Ruprecht &amp; W\u00f6rner, 2007; \n\nGinibre &amp; W\u00f6rner, 2007; Gagnevin et al., 2007; Andrews et al., 2008; Viccaro et al., 2010, 2016; \n\nGiacomini et al., 2014; Shane, 2015; Coote &amp; Shane, 2016). \n\nThe crystal size distribution (CSD) theory provides support to evaluate how igneous textures \n\nevolve and allow quantification of magmatic residence timescales (Randolph &amp; Larson, 1971; \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nCashman &amp; Marsh, 1988). The combination of plagioclase chemical and isotopic data with CSD \n\nresults has been proved to be a successful approach to unravel petrological processes (e.g. Piochi et al., \n\n2005; McCanta et al., 2007; Morgan et al., 2007; Salisbury et al., 2008; Fornaciai et al., 2015; Flaherty \n\net al., 2018). \n\nIn this work, we investigate some acid volcanic rocks of the PEMP on the surroundings of the \n\nGuarapuava city, Paran\u00e1 State, southern Brazil. These rocks present a  tabular geometry up to tens of \n\nkilometers wide and a high silica content, which together foment a controversial debate about their \n\norigin and emplacement style; lava vs ignimbrite (Bellieni et al., 1986; Garland et al., 1995; Polo et al., \n\n2017; Luchetti et al., 2018a, b). We combined cold-stage cathodoluminescence and scanning electron \n\nmicroprobe to select plagioclase crystal zones for the conduction of in situ Sr isotopes analyzes, which \n\ncombined with CSD studies allowed placing time constraints to the identified magmatic processes. We \n\ncompare the results with the data in the literature and, finally, propose some petrological insights to \n\nthe emplacement style for the Guarapuava Acid Volcanics (GAV) rocks and their bearing on the \n\nevolution of the acid magmatism of the PEMP. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n2 GEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND \n\nThe breaking of the Gondwana Supercontinent and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the \n\nEarly Cretaceous was marked by a colossal magmatic event preserved as one of the world\u2019s largest \n\nContinental Flood Basalts (CFB) known as Paran\u00e1-Etendeka Magmatic Province (PEMP). Most of the \n\nvolume of the PEMP outcrops in South America (Fig. 1), with minor amounts preserved on the \n\nAfrican counterpart, in Namibia (Hawkesworth et al., 1992; Bryan et al. 2010). \n\nOn Brazil, the volcanic rocks of the PEMP occur as shallow intrusions and flows on the top of the \n\nPhanerozoic sediments of the Paran\u00e1 Basin. The flows cover ~ 1 x 10\n6\n Km\n\n2\n and have thicknesses \n\nvarying from tens of meters up to a kilometer (Frank et al., 2009). Dyke swarms and small alkaline \n\nintrusions associated in the nearby Pre-Cambrian basement are ubiquitous but much less abundant \n\n(Comin-Chiaramonti &amp; Gomes, 2005). Accurate Ar\n40\n\n/Ar\n39\n\n dating of fresh plagioclase crystals and U-\n\nPb dating of zircon (Pinto et al., 2011) and baddeleyite (Janasi te al., 2011) crystals separated from \n\nacid rocks indicate that the whole province formed in a time span of 3 to 5 M.y. in the Early \n\nCretaceous around 135 M.y. (Renne et al. 1992, 1996; Thiede &amp; Vasconcelos, 2010; Baksi, 2017). \n\nThe basalts represent over 90% of the lava volume and occur as flows and shallow intrusions \n\n(dykes and sills) reaching up 1500 m in the thickest portions (Frank et al., 2009). Intermediate rocks \n\ncorrespond to around 7% of the province, whereas silicic lavas represent less than 2.5% of the total \n\nPMP volume; albeit volumetrically less important, their volume overcomes what is commonly \n\nassociated to CFBs worldwide (Nardy et al., 2002; Bryan et al., 2010). The tholeiitic magmatism is \n\nregionally distinctive in geochemistry, with high titanium basalts (HTiB) prevailing to the north, \n\nwhereas low titanium basalts (LTiB) occur chiefly at the south of the PEMP. These were subsequently \n\ndivided in other subtypes based on isotopic and trace element signatures (Peate et al., 1992; Peate, \n\n1997; Nardy et al., 2002; Polo &amp; Janasi, 2014) and are shown in Table 1.  \n\nThe acid volcanics occurs as isolated plateaus restricted to the eastern edge of the Paran\u00e1 \n\nsedimentary basin along the 25 - 35\u00b0S latitudes (Fig. 1). Based on textural and compositional \n\ncontrasts, the acid rocks are divided in two major groups: Palmas, which comprises microporphyritic \n\nto aphyric, low-Ti dacites and rhyolites, and Chapec\u00f3, which is composed of porphyritic, high-Ti \n\ntrachydacites and dacites. Both types were further subdivided into minor types on the basis of their \n\nisotopic and trace element signatures (Table 1; Peate et al., 1992; Peate, 1997; Garland et al., 1995 \n\nNardy et al., 2008). \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Geological map focusing the south PMP in Brazil.

(2014). Sample locations are indicated on the inset on right portion of the image. \n\n \n\nTable 1 - Geochemical characteristics of the PMP volcanic rocks. Data from: Peate et al., 1992; Peate, 1997; Garland et al., \n\n1995; Nardy et al., 2008; Freitas, 2009; Rocha-J\u00fanior et al., 2013; Polo &amp; Janasi, 2014; Barreto et al., 2016. Polo et al., 2017. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nIrrespective of composition, high and low titanium compositions prevail roughly at the north and \n\nsouth of the province, respectively (Fig. 1). The sharing of common isotopic and geochemical features \n\nbetween the acid rocks and their associated basalts suggest an apparent petrogenetic relation (Fig. 2). \n\nThe restricted occurrence of these rocks on the eastern edge of the basin suggest the role of a high heat \n\nflux close to the former rift axis on their genesis. The higher radiogenic signatures of the Palmas rocks \n\nwould reflect processes of crustal contamination combined with fractional crystallization of the \n\nparental basaltic magma (Garland et al., 1995; Florisbal et al., 2018). Partial melting of middle/lower \n\ncrust might be more relevant than suspected for the Palmas petrogenesis (Harris &amp; Milner, 1997). \n\nOtherwise, partial melting of basaltic underplates with negligible crustal assimilation is evoked as the \n\nmain processes responsible for the Chapec\u00f3 petrogenesis (Bellieni et al., 1986; Garland et al., 1995). \n\nThe present work focuses on the Chapec\u00f3 rocks of the Guarapuava Acid Volcanics (GAV) type \n\nthat crops out on the transitional zone between the north and south domains of the PEMP (Fig. 1). The \n\nlocal geology is marked by intercalations of Pitanga (HTiB) and Esmeralda (LTiB) basalts, forming a \n\nmafic sequence reaching up 1 km in thickness overlying Paleozoic sediments from the Paran\u00e1 Basin \n\n(Lopes, 2008). The GAV rocks cover this basaltic unit, forming tabular sequences with thicknesses up \n\nto 100 meters (Nardy et al., 2002). Literature data indicate that GAV whole-rock major element \n\ncomposition are remarkably similar, being classified as trachydacites (Bellieni et al., 1986; Garland et \n\nal., 1995; Nardy et al., 2008, 2011;  Pinto et al., 2011; Luchetti et al., 2014; Table 2).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - a) ?Nd134 x \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr134 graph exhibiting the sub-types of the basic and acid units of the PMP.

Six to \n\nseven 30\u00b5m-thick sections were obtained per sample. The serial sectioning was intended to improve \n\nthe statistical representativeness of the results, rather than to reconstruct 3D crystal shapes. Optical \n\nmicroscopy and imaging were performed under uncrossed polarized light using a petrographic \n\nmicroscope (Leica M420) coupled to a regular digital camera. The photos were mosaicked in order to \n\nobtain images of the thin section as a whole (see Fig. 3). Plagioclase crystals were manually outlined \n\nusing Adobe Photoshop, in order to prevent problems with the individualization of touching crystals \n\n(see appendix 8.1). The digitized images from different thin sections of the same sample were stacked \n\ntogether as a unique panel. Dimensions of the bestfit ellipses of the digitized crystals were obtained \n\nusing ImageJ software, an open access image analysis program (Rasband, 2010). The results were \n\nimported into the CSDCorrections 1.51 software (Higgins, 2000) for stereological corrections and \n\nacquisition of the CSD curves.       \n\n \n\nTable 3 - Sample locations. \n\n \n\nThe stereological conversion requires the input of the mean crystal shape expressed in terms of the \n\nshort(S) : intermediate(I) : long(L) axes. According to Higgins (1994), the S/I ratio is close to the \n\nintersection width/length mode calculated by the CSDCorrections software (constant at 0.59 for the \n\nanalyzed samples). Assessment of the I/L ratio in randomly oriented rocks is more complicated. \n\nHiggins (1994) suggested using the skewness of the intersection rate distributions, whereas Higgins \n\n(2006a) proposed examining the (010) face of plagioclase crystals for direct evaluation of the I/L ratio. \n\nSuitably oriented plagioclase crystals resulted I/L ratio close to 0.7. Thus, the plagioclase aspect ratio \n\nchosen to represent all samples was 1.0 : 1.7 : 2.5. Most crystals have euhedral habits with angular \n\nshapes and were considered to have a roundness factor of 0.3 (on a scale of 0 to 1; 0=block; \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n1=ellipsoid). Logarithmic length intervals were defined in a way that the next bin is 10\n0.20\n\n times larger \n\nthan the previous one. All the CSDs were calculated on a vesicle free basis (tests varying the vesicle \n\namount up to 3% produced no appreciable differences). Bins with less than 10 crystals per unit area or \n\nwith large uncertainties were removed from the CSDs due to compromised measurement precision. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Examples of thin section panels of the PA-16-04 (a) and PA-16-19 (b) samples with uncrossed polars.  (c) and (d) \n\nare the respective digitized outlines of plagioclase crystals. \n\n3.2  Cathodoluminescence Imaging \n\nThe bombardment of materials by electrons produces a wide range of secondary particles and \n\nradiations, including light, which is the phenomenon of cathodoluminescence (CL) (Pagel et al., \n\n2000). Electrons lose their energy fast in minerals; hence, the CL light is produced close to the surface. \n\nCL light has a wide range of wavelengths, but usually only the visible light is used for geological \n\npurposes. The intensity and color of luminescence are highly variable and depend on several factors \n\nincluding the concentration of activator trace elements (Table 4). In plagioclase, the most important \n\nactivators are Mn\n2+\n\n and Fe\n3+\n\n, but the elements Cu\n2+\n\n, Ti\n4+\n\n, Ce\n3+\n\n and Eu\n2+\n\n may also be important (Mora \n\n&amp; Ramseyer, 1992). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nTable 4 - Cathodoluminescence properties of the minerals found in the volcanic rocks imaged in this study. \n\n  \n\n \n\nIn this study, CL images were obtained at the University of Qu\u00e9bec at Chicoutimi, Canada, with a \n\nCITL CL8200 cold cathode instrument mounted on a regular petrographic microscope. In this \n\nequipment, a wide electron beam is directed towards a polished thin section, which is in a vacuum \n\nchamber attached to the microscope stage. An area about 3 mm in diameter is obliquely illuminated \n\nwith electrons. Light from the section escapes through a window into the objective of the microscope \n\nand the system detects simultaneously both CL color and intensity. The images were acquired using a \n\nvoltage of 10 Kv and an electric current of 185 \u00b5\u00c5. Multiple images were mosaicked to give a \n\ncomposite image covering the entire thin section.  \n\n \n\n3.3  Scanning Electron Microscope \n\nOne sample (FP-15-15) with well-defined banded structure was cut and separated in slices \n\nrepresenting the macroscopic diversity of the GAV (lighter and darker bands). Each slice was \n\nseparately crushed in millimeter-size pieces and mounted on polished epoxy sections. Scanning \n\nElectron Microscope (SEM) was performed using a Quanta 600 FEG (FEI) coupled with an energy \n\ndisperse spectrometer (EDS; Quantax, Bruker) in the Laborat\u00f3rio de Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica \n\n(LCT) of the Escola Polit\u00e9cnica da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. Phases associations were characterized \n\nthrough backscattered images, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray digital mapping for \n\nthe major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Na, K, Ca, Ti, P).  \n\n \n\n3.4   X-ray Diffraction \n\n X-ray diffraction patterns of powder samples from the lighter and darker bands of sample FP-\n\n15-15 were collected in a Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer at the N\u00facleo de Apoio \u00e0 Pesquisa \n\n(NAP) Geoanal\u00edtica, Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (IGc-USP). Analyzes \n\nwere performed in a step scan mode with angular range from 5\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 2?, step size 0.02\u00b0, 70s/step, \n\nCu K?, 40kV, 40mA, flat sample holders, fixed divergence slit and 0.1mm receiving slit. The samples \n\nwere mixed with 10 wt% of high purity ?-Al2O3. Ritveld refinements was performed using High Score \n\nPlus 3.0 Panalytical Software. The following crystallographic information files (CIF) were used: \n\nplagioclase An52 (Horst et al., 1981), quartz, sanidine and augite (Gualtieri, 2000). Magnetite, \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\npigeonite, enstatite and apatite occur as minor phases and were not included in quantitative phase \n\nanalyzes due to their low weight fraction and, consequently, large intrinsic errors.  \n\n \n\n3.5  Plagioclase in situ analyzes \n\n Plagioclase isotopic analyzes were conducted with in adjacent micrometric spots in order to \n\nsample material from the same mineral growth zones.  \n\nIn situ Sr isotope analyzes in plagioclase were carried out at two stages. One at the Radiogenic \n\nIsotope Facility (RIF, University of Alberta, Canada) in 2009 (sample FP-15-15) and another one at \n\nthe MidWest Isotope and Trace Element Research Analytical Center (MITERAC) of the University of \n\nNotre Dame in 2017 (samples PA-16-01 and -21). The analyses at the RIF were conducted using a \n\nNuPlasma MC-ICP-MS coupled with a Laser Ablation UP213 system under analytical conditions of \n\nlaser beam diameter of 160 \u00b5m and 10 Hz frequency at energy output of approximately 11J/cm\n2\n. \n\nWhereas, the analyses at the MITERAC were performed using a NuPlasma II MC-ICP-MS coupled \n\nwith the Excimer NWR-193 nm LA system, under analytical conditions of laser beam diameter of 150 \n\n\u00b5m at a 10 Hz frequency at energy output of approximately 14J/cm\n2\n. For Sr isotope determinations, a \n\nmodern coral was used as external standard, whereas monitoring of the invariant \n84\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratio \n\n0.056546 \u00b1 0.00001 (2?) allowed assessment of the effectiveness of the interference correction. \n\nRepeated measurements on the modern coral yielded an average \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr value 0.709156 \u00b1 0.00005 \n\n(2?) which agree with the value for the modern sea water of 0.709168 (Hodell et al., 1990). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n4 RESULTS \n\n4.1 Field Aspects \n\nGAV exposures are marked by a laterally discontinuous sub horizontal banding that alternates \n\nthree-dimensional light- and dark-colored  bands with anastomosed geometries with high aspect ratios \n\n(Figs. 4 a and b). As a purely descriptive term, this pattern will be referred as banding. There seems to \n\nbe a close association between banding and fracturing. The light bands are composed predominantly \n\nby a very fine granular white material; whereas the dark bands have a prevailing massive appearance \n\n(Figs.4 c and d). In spite of the apparently sharp transition between bands, there is no evident \n\npetrographic difference and close inspection reveals the contacts to be of diffuse and gradational \n\ncharacter (Figs. 4c and d). At outcrop scale, the internal fabric of the rock is massive and \n\nhomogeneous showing no preferred orientation of crystals and major differences between both bands \n\nother than their colors. Spherical vesicles up to 5 mm are a common feature, but in small amounts and \n\ntheir distribution is apparently unrelated to banding. The samples have bimodal texture marked by \n\nvery fine-grained matrix interspersed with plagioclase macrocrysts reaching up 1.5 cm (Figs. 4 c-f). \n\nSome single plagioclase crystals are common in both bands (Figs. 4 d and f). The precise stratigraphic \n\ncontrol of the visited outcrops imposed a very challenging task due to extensive faulting and the \n\npresence of thick soil horizons. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - a) Anastomosed pattern of the GAV trachydacites from Guarapuava region marked by alternation of light and dark \n\nbands. b) Sample from the respective outcrops showing the three-dimensional structure of the rock. c) Slice of a GAV \n\ndisplaying light and dark bands. d) Inset of the red rectangle in c) showing details of both bands. e) Same slice showed in c) \n\nafter staining. f) Inset of the red rectangle in e).

Groundmass in yellow. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n4.2 Petrography \n\n4.2.1 Groundmass  \n\nThe matrix represents 80 to 90% volume of the samples. It is defined by a framework of \n\nindiscernible crystallites and small crystals (&lt;0.2mm) of pyroxene and Ti-rich magnetite (Figs. 6a and \n\nb). Glass was not observed in optical or electron microscopy, neither was it detected in X-ray \n\ndiffraction. Despite the relative homogeneity, the groundmass shows subtle size variations according \n\nto the sample stratigraphic position, with the finest sample observed just above the contact with the \n\nunderlying basalts. Irrespective of band color, the matrices from different bands show no substantial \n\ndifferences under the petrographic microscope. \n\n4.2.2 Plagioclase \n\nPlagioclase is the most abundant macrocrystic phase, corresponding to 10-15% area in thin \n\nsections. Plagioclase occurs preferably as individual euhedral crystals (Figs. 6c and d) up to 1 cm or, \n\nless frequently, as mono or polymineralic clusters. Plagioclase crystals from the mineral clusters \n\ncontrast with individual crystals in having rounded edges and sinuous contacts against each other. \n\nRegardless of the textural association, most crystals show no evident zoning under the petrographic \n\nmicroscope. The largest crystals commonly host irregular 0.2 to 2 mm wide patches filled with \n\nmaterial that resemble the matrix of the rock, interpreted to represent devitrified melt inclusions.    \n\n4.2.3 Pyroxene  \n\nPyroxene occurs either as widespread individual crystals set in the groundmass, as fine \n\naggregates within and around plagioclase (Figs. 6c, d, g-m), or as rare monomineralic clusters (Fig. \n\n6n). It has smaller sizes (0.1 to 1 mm) compared with plagioclase and show subeuhedral to anhedral \n\nhabits, often exhibiting rounded shapes when clustered with plagioclase (Figs. 6i and j).  \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Microphotographs under transmitted light showing the petrographic aspects of the GAV trachydacite samples. a) \n\nGroundmass from sample FP-15-15 with uncrossed and crossed polars on the left and right halves, respectively. b) Inset of the red \n\nrectangle displayed on a). c) Euhedral plagioclase from sample PA-16-04 with some pyroxene crystals around it.

The groundmass is composed by an \n\nirregular mixture of distinct patches in dark and bright shades of blue (Figs. 5 and 6a). The dark blue \n\npatches constitute a fine framework resembling touching feldspar microlites with interstices filled by \n\nquartz (Figs. 7a and b). The feldspar microlites have sizes up to 100\u00b5m, but are usually much smaller. \n\nThey commonly show inner and outer portions in green and blue colors, respectively (Fig. 7b). The \n\nbright blue patches are monomineralic aggregates of feldspar crystals (Figs. 7c and d). Some samples \n\nshow irregular fractures which are immediately surrounded by dark blue patches; whilst bright ones \n\noccur gradually further from it (Figs. 7e and f). One exception to the textural patterns described above \n\nis the sample taken at the contact with the basaltic substrate (PA-16-21). It shows a very fine, \n\nhomogeneous groundmass with a regular CL response in dark blue color (Figs. 7g, h and i). Another \n\nstriking feature from the groundmass observed on all the samples is a remarkable spatial association \n\nbetween tiny apatite crystals and pyroxene/Fe-Ti oxides (Fig. 7i). A similar texture has been described \n\nin the Palmas volcanic rocks (Dias et al., 2017).  \n\nIrrespective of shape and size, plagioclase macrocrysts show homogeneous CL responses both \n\nintra- and inter samples. Crystals appears always with dark green luminescence (Figs. 8a and b). \n\nStructures like zonation, growth and resorption zones are either lacking or are very rare and \n\nobliterated. Pockets filled with materials similar to the groundmass are interpreted as devitrified melt \n\ninclusions and appear in different shades of blue and varying shapes and sizes (Figs. 8c,d and e).      \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - CL images of the groundmass from distinct samples.

A closer inspection reveal both matrices to be defined by two petrographically distinct domains: \n\none with a continuous backscattered signal (Massive Matrix \u2013 MM), and another one defined by a \n\ndiscontinuous backscattered signal speckled by varying amounts of tiny vugs (Porous Matrix \u2013 PM) \n\n(Figs. 9c and d). Both occur dispersed through the matrices composing irregular areas with diffuse \n\ncontacts against each other (Figs. 9c-h).  \n\n \n\n4.4.1 Massive matrix (MM) \n\nX-ray mapping of the MM domain reveals a mottled pattern that alternates dark and light \n\ntones of grey (Fig. 10a). Element maps reveal the former to be composed of Si, whereas the light areas \n\nhave increased Na, K and Al contents, implying a quartz-feldspathic composition, respectively (Figs. 9 \n\nb-e). The inner portions of the feldspathic zones are enriched in Na, Ca and Al, whereas the outer parts \n\ncontain enhanced K contents. All these findings are in agreement with EDS analyzes (Fig. 10a and in \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nappendix 8.2). A merged image of all the individual maps gives a clear view of how the compositional \n\nvariability (Fig. 10i). \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Porous matrix (PM) \n\nLocally, tiny feldspar crystals with a \u201cvuggy\u201d aspect occur interspersed with the PM. A \n\nrepresentative image comprehending both MM and PM is illustrated in Figure 11a. The same \n\ncompositional trends described so far are also observed in the MM domain. However, the PM (on the \n\nright corner of Fig. 11) shows high responses of K, Al and Na and intermediate ones of Si compared \n\nwith the contents observed in the MM, implying an alkali feldspar composition (Figs. 11b-e). Again, a \n\nmerged image of all the individual maps clearly illustrates the distribution of the major elements (Fig. \n\n11j), confirmed by EDS analyses as indicated in Figure 11a and in appendix 8.2. \n\n \n\nTable 6 - Summary of the MM and PM features. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe small black features seen in Figs. 10 and 11 are interpreted as vugs, once they did not present \n\nany chemical response, and correspond to areas with no CL signal. A summary of the features from \n\nboth domains is presented in Table 6. \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - a) Backscattered electron (BSE) image of the general appearance of the light (a) and dark (b) band samples. c) BSE \n\nencompassing MM and PM domains in detail.

They have similar mineral composition, with large predominance of plagioclase over quartz \n\nand sanidine, and smaller amounts of augite. However, important differences in mineral relative \n\nabundance are observed, since the dark band is enriched in quartz and depleted in sanidine relative to \n\nthe light band (Table 7). Both bands are holocrystaline.  \n\n \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 X-ray diffraction patterns of light and dark bands in blue and red lines, respectively.  \n\n \n\nTable 7 - Modal mineralogy estimated after Rietveld treatment.

Crystal populations were divided in 11 to 12 \n\nsize ranges (Table 8). The CSDs have striking similar shapes defining concave-up curves, with a turn-\n\ndown at classes with smaller crystal sizes. Sample PA-16-21, which was sampled at the contact with \n\nthe basaltic substrate, shows steeper patterns for the smaller crystal classes (Fig. 13a). Plagioclase \n\ncrystals were separated in different populations according to a main inflection on the CSD curves \n\nrepresented by separate linear fits (Fig. 13b). We defined phenocrysts and microphenocrysts as being \n\nlarger and smaller than 3 mm respectively. Except for the fit obtained for sample PA-16-21, the \n\nresulting values for slope and intercept of the linear segments are very similar (Table 9). Residence \n\ntimes calculated for microphenocyst and phenocryst populations are shown in Table 9.  \n\n \n\nTable 8 - Number of crystals per unit area\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 - a) Compilation of crystal size distribution of the nine GAV samples selected for this study. b) Linear best fitting \n\nfor plagioclase phenocrysts (blue line) and microphenocrysts (red line). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\nTable 9 \u2013 Geometrical parameters and magmatic timescales obtained from microphenocryst and phenocryst populations (Fig. \n\n13b).  \n\n \n\n4.7  Plagioclase Sr isotopes  \n\n Sr isotope results obtained on plagioclase crystals are summarized in Figure 14. Obtained \n\nratios vary from 0.70549 to 0.70587 with an average 2? uncertainty of \u00b1 0.00004 and Rb/Sr under \n\n0.02. Except for sample FP-15-15 which shows \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios overlapping within error, two of the \n\nthree analyzed crystals in sample PA-16-01, and three of the four analyzed crystals in sample PA-16-\n\n21, display intracrystal variations outside analytical error. As a general trend, isotope profiles are \n\nmarked either by more radiogenic cores overgrown by comparatively primitive rims, referred as A-\n\ntype profiles (sample PA-16-01) or by more primitive cores overgrown by isotopically evolved rims, \n\nreferred as U-type profiles (sample PA-16-21). Regardless of isotope zoning fashion, obtained \n\n87\nSr/\n\n86\nSr ratios all fall within the isotopic spectrum of the GAV whole rock data (see blue area in Fig. \n\n14; Garland et al., 1995). \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Plagioclase in situ Sr isotope results in 2?. The mean \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratio and its envelopes are shown in thick and thin \n\ngreen lines, respectively. The blue area represents the GAV whole-rock \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr interval (Garland et al., 1995). Bar length \n\nrepresent analytical errors. Sample FP-15-15 (red bars) have no spatial control relative to core-rim distance. On other \n\nsamples, each color represent a single analyzed crystal. Empty and filled bars represent rims and cores, respectively. One \n\nstippled bar in sample PA-16-21 correspond to an intermediate analyzed position. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n5  DISCUSSION \n\n5.1  Reliability of in situ Sr isotopes \n\n \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios determined via LA-ICP-MS might be hampered by the interference of \n87\n\nRb. \n\nThus, the latter must be corrected in order to guarantee reliable Sr isotope ratios. Rb has only one non-\n\nradiogenic isotope (\n85\n\nRb) and mass bias fractionation of Sr might be applied to correct the Rb \n\nfractionation. In order to minimize such problems, this technique must be applied for materials bearing \n\nvery low Rb/Sr ratios (usually&lt;0.05) (Ramos et al., 2004; Vroon et al., 2008). The high Sr signals \n\n(average 2.88 V) imply minimum Rb isobaric interference.and reliable \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios determinations.  \n\n \n\n5.2  Plagioclase CSD Shapes \n\nIn igneous rocks, the final texture results from a balance between kinetic, mechanical and \n\nequilibrium processes (e.g. Higgins, 2006). Concave-up CSDs have been reported in many natural \n\nrocks and attributed to a variety of processes such as physical mixing of distinct magmas (Higgins, \n\n1996; Salisbury et al., 2008), textural coarsening (Higgins, 1998, 2002, 2011a,b), continuous to \n\nsudden changes of intensive magmatic variables (Cashman &amp; Marsh, 1988; Armienti, 1994; Marsh, \n\n1998; Ngonge et al., 2013; Preece et al., 2013; Fornaciai et al., 2015), heterogeneous nucleation \n\n(\u0160pillar &amp; Dolej\u0161, 2015) or a combination of these processes. Concave-up CSDs were also obtained in \n\nrun products of experimental studies, reinforcing the ubiquity of this feature in silicate melts (e.g. \n\nBurkhard, 2002; Pupier et al., 2008; Brugger &amp; Hammer, 2010). The concave-up CSDs reported in \n\nthis study display a turn-down to the left of their maximum population density (Fig. 13a). This effect \n\ncannot be an artifact due to inadequate spatial resolution as the smallest bin represented on the CSD \n\ngraph \u2013 0.147 to 0.233 mm \u2013 has distinct values among different samples and all of them were \n\nobtained following the same procedures. The scarcity of crystals under a critical size might be \n\nachieved by textural coarsening, also known as Ostwald ripening (Voorhees, 1992). As smaller \n\ncrystals have a higher surface/volume ratio than larger ones, they contain a higher surface free energy, \n\nwhich might imply in their dissolution to give way to coarser crystals in melts kept under high \n\ntemperature, close to the mineral liquidus (Higgins, 2011a). As coarsening progresses, the slope of the \n\nright side of the CSD decreases. The observation of rounded plagioclase crystals with curved contacts \n\nagainst each other and the relatively scarcity of small crystals associated with the exceptionally high \n\nGAV magmatic temperatures (Table 10), are consistent to coarsening as the main mechanism \n\nresponsible for the concave-up curvature of the plagioclase CSD curves. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\n5.3  Magmatic Timescales \n\nAccording to the CSD theory, the slope of the CSD curve is inversely proportional to the \n\nproduct of growth rate (G) and residence time ( ) (Marsh, 1988). However, G is a composition-\n\ndependent factor that may show a non-linear relation with cooling rates (e.g. Gibb, 1974; Swanson, \n\n1977; Fenn, 1977). Cashman (1993) showed that increasing cooling rate by 100 will produce an \n\ninsignificant tenfold increase in G values of plagioclase crystallizing from basaltic melts. This \n\ncorroborated previous findings that plagioclase G commonly vary no more than one order of \n\nmagnitude over a broad range of crystallization conditions (Cashman &amp; Marsh, 1988; Cashman, 1990, \n\n1992).  \n\nPlagioclase growth rates in acid magmas are still poorly constrained relative to mafic compositions. \n\nEstimates based on experimental studies (Geschwind &amp; Rutherford, 1995; Hammer &amp; Rutherford, \n\n2002; Couch, 2003; Larsen, 2005; Brugger &amp; Hammer, 2010), crystal size distribution (Cashman, \n\n1992; Higgins, 1996; Hammer et al., 1999), compositional zoning patterns (McCanta et al., 2007), and \n\nin situ secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling (Genareau &amp; Clarke, 2010), point to typical \n\nvalues ranging between 10\n-8\n\n and 10\n-9\n\n mm.s\n-1\n\n. Using these growth rates, the obtained timescales are up \n\nto a few tens of years (Table 9). We prefer the slower growth rates and respective timescales for the \n\nphenocrysts (35-40 years), whereas faster growth rates are preferred for the microphenocryst \n\npopulation (1.5\u20131.8 years). \n\n \n\n5.4  Eruptive Style \n\nAcid lavas with large areal extents and low aspect ratios are rarely observed within intraplate \n\nvolcanic provinces (Bonnichsen &amp; Kauffman, 1987; Henry et al., 1988; Creaser &amp; White, 1991; Green \n\n&amp; Fitz, 1993). This is because acid magma often forms pyroclastic deposits produced by explosive \n\ninstead of effusive volcanic activity (e.g. Cas &amp; Wright, 1987). Previous studies have proposed \n\ntextural and field criteria for distinguishing between strongly rheomorphic ignimbrites and extensive \n\nsilicic lavas (Henry &amp; Wolff, 1992). However, these criteria are often ambiguous, blurring a verdict \n\nabout the eruptive style (e.g. Henry et al., 1988; Andrews &amp; Branney, 2011). \n\nMost studies regarding the emplacement model of the PMP acid volcanism are concentrated on the \n\nsouthernmost Palmas rocks, where an effusive eruption style seems to predominate (Garland et al., \n\n1995; Waichel et al., 2012; Polo &amp; Janasi, 2014; Polo et al., 2017; Rosseti et al., 2017; Guimar\u00e3es et \n\nal., 2017; Sim\u00f5es et al., 2017; Lima et al., 2018). Similar investigations on the Chapec\u00f3-type rocks are \n\nmuch less abundant, but equally point to a predominant effusive emplacement (Garland et al., 1995; \n\nJanasi et al., 2007). However, the eruptive style of Palmas and Chapec\u00f3 rocks is still a matter of debate \n\nand rejection is specially based on the acid nature of such rocks (Luchetti et al., 2018a, b). \n\nLiterature geothermometric data calculated using different models indicate that the Chapec\u00f3-type \n\nrocks crystallized from very hot magmas, with temperatures on the order of 950 \u2013 1050\u00b0C (see Table \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n10). GAV magmas water content were estimated by input of whole rock major element composition \n\n(Table 2), plagioclase anorthite content (Nardy et al., 2011) and magmatic temperature (Table 10), \n\nusing to be very low (below 1.5% H2O, Fig. 17a; Waters &amp; Lange, 2015). Afterwards, viscosity values \n\nwere calculated by input of 1.5% H2O, 1000\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure was probably close to 10\n4.01\n\n \n\nPa.s (Fig. 17b, Giordano et al., 2008). These results are considerably lower than intensive variables \n\ncalculated for recent well-documented lavas with similar silica contents (59-65% SiO2) that flowed far \n\nfrom their vents (viscosities ranging from 10\n9 \n\n- 10\n11\n\n Pa s; MacKay et al., 1998; Navarro-Ochoa et al., \n\n2002; Harris et al., 2004).  \n\n \n\nTable 10 - Geothermometric data of the Chapec\u00f3 rocks compiled from the literature. Temperatures are reported in Celsius \n\ndegrees. \n\n  \n\n \n\nLuchetti et al. (2018b) found similar viscosity values for the GAV magmas, but instead of an \n\neffusive eruptive style, the authors proposed a pyroclastic low fountaining origin for the respective \n\ndeposits, and stressed the fact that similar or even less viscous magmas could fragment and behave \n\nexplosively, according to experimental work performed on rhyolite melts of calc-alkaline (10\n6\n \u2013 10\n\n8\n Pa \n\ns; Castro &amp; Dingwell, 2009) or pantelleritic (10\n4\n \u2013 10\n\n6\n Pa s; Di Genova et al., 2013; Campagnola et al., \n\n2016; Hughes et al., 2017) compositions. However, we stress that direct comparison of rocks with \n\nsuch distinct compositions and geological settings has to be taken cautiously, because of the intricate \n\nrelationship between composition and viscosity. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 \u2013 A) Graph displaying the initial water contents (in weight %) of the GAV melts as a function of feasible \n\ntemperature and pressure conditions. As there are no published glass/groundmass analyses of the GAV rocks, we considered \n\nthe whole-rock as the initial melt composition. Above 1000\u00b0C the water contents are negligible and were omitted from the \n\ngraph. Whole-rock compositions and corresponding plagioclase An contents required for the calculations were taken from \n\nGarland et al. (1995), Lopes (2008) and Nardy et al. (2011). Hygrometer model by Waters &amp; Lange (2015). B) Graph \n\ndisplaying magmatic viscosities at atmospheric pressure as function of temperature and water dissolved in the GAV melts. \n\nViscosity model by Giordano et al. (2008). \n\n \n\nBased on the detailed investigation performed in this contribution, we offer an alternative \n\nexplanation for the eruptive style of the GAV rocks. The steeper and larger population density of \n\nsample PA-16-21 (taken from the contact with the underlying basalts) along with the smaller \n\nplagioclase sizes, indicate a faster solidification of the lower border relative to the core of the volcanic \n\nbody (Fig.13a; Table 9). Such stratigraphic controlled plagioclase size distribution has not been \n\ndescribed in ignimbrites. Unfortunately, due to erosion, we did not find an equivalent upper border, \n\nbut there is no obvious reason to believe it does not existed. Once formed, these fast-solidified borders \n\nwould act as carapaces preventing further heat loss and reducing cooling rates at the interior of the \n\nflow via thermal insulation. Remote imaging of active lava fields has demonstrated how exceptional \n\nthermal insulation allow km-scale flowing of highly viscous acid lavas (Harris et al., 2004; Tuffen et \n\nal., 2013). The combination of low magmatic viscosities, high eruption rates and thermal insulation \n\nwould have created a singular condition for an effusive emplacement of the GAV magmas, accounting \n\nfor their sheet-like geometry. The identification of Chapec\u00f3 (Ourinhos type; Janasi et al., 2007) and \n\nPalmas (Sim\u00f5es et al., 2017; Lima et al., 2018) dykes point to a fissural and shallow feeder system for \n\nthe acid magmatism of the PEMP, in which such flows would be continuously fed and inflated by \n\nthese dykes. The lack of basal breccias, typical at the contact of regular lava flows with the substrate \n\ndue to the large temperature difference, would be explained by flow of the acid lavas over a relatively \n\nhot basaltic substrate that could prevent the development of fractures as on the lower portions of the \n\nGAV deposits. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n5.5  The origin of banded structures \n\nBanding in the acid rocks of the PEMP has been interpreted as a product of bomb coalescence \n\nand welding (dark bands, or \u00b4blobs\u2019) followed by stretching due to flow-induced rheomorphism in a \n\nlow-explosivity, fire fountain, eruptive scenario (Luchetti et al., 2018a). The authors did not discuss \n\nhow such coalescence would produce the alternate colors observed in rocks. \n\nBased on the detailed textural studies conducted in bands with different colors, we offer an \n\nalternative explanation for the origin of the banded structure based on: (1) the lack of broken crystals \n\nor of any kind of discontinuity observed in the groundmass under the petrographic microscope, CL \n\nand SEM images (2) the crosscut relationship between different bands and plagioclase major axis (3) \n\nthe low viscosities and very low water contents dissolved in the magmas that would allow flowing \n\neven considering the high silica contents (4) the isotopic homogeneity recorded in plagioclase (5) the \n\nregional scale of the banding occurring through tens of meters thick volcanic deposits.  \n\nMagmatic flow banding has been attributed to magma mingling (e.g. Seaman et al., 1995) or \n\nrepeated fracture and healing events (e.g. Tuffen et al., 2003; Gonnermann &amp; Manga, 2005). However, \n\nsuch mechanisms seem unlikely here once GAV show no evidence of interaction between contrasting \n\nmagmas and the observed banding is not planar neither shows abrupt contacts, respectively. The \n\ncomplete lack of textural evidence further disproves these hypotheses. Seaman et al. (2009) suggested \n\nthat heterogeneous distribution of water in a rhyolitic lava flow could led to uneven undercooling \n\nrates, textures and colors, resulting in flow banding. Despite the very low water contents of the GAV \n\nmagmas (? 1.5%; Fig. 17), fluids certainly played a role on the eruptive style as indicated by the \n\ncommon presence of vesicles. Feldspar microlites in the massive matrix (MM) domains are commonly \n\ncharacterized by plagioclase cores (possibly andesine) mantled by potassium-rich alkali feldspar rims \n\n(see Fig. 10i); compositional pairs which are not in equilibrium (Nekvasil, 1992). This uncommon \n\nfeature has also been described in the Merapi Dome andesitic lavas, Indonesia, where it was attributed \n\nto a sudden change in the melt evolution path over the feldspar ternary diagram, passing from the \n\nplagioclase + liquid field to the alkali feldspar + liquid field in response to syn-eruptive degassing, \n\nallowing overgrowth of the alkali feldspar over plagioclase (Hammer et al., 2000).  \n\nInterstitial quartz crystals in the MM indicate a highly evolved melt and relatively small \n\nundercooling rates allowing sluggish nucleation and growth of quartz. Apparently, degassing only \n\noccurred in very shallow levels and probably continued up to the surface (Nardy et al., 2011). We \n\nsuggest that the GAV magmas were originally erupted as a homogeneous mixture of very hot lava \n\ncarrying a ~15% crystal cargo containing plagioclase + pyroxene + Fe-Ti oxides and minor volatiles. \n\nThe lack of flow banding and massive aspect of the groundmass on sample PA-16-21 (Figs. 7g, h and \n\ni), taken at the contact with the basaltic substrate, reinforce this interpretation, since rapid \n\ncrystallization would prevent flow and continued growth of the plagioclase microphenocryst \n\npopulation. The high eruption rates and relatively low viscosities enabled a relatively fast outpouring \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n \n\nand spreading of the GAV magmas over the flat and probably hot basaltic paleosurface. Once the MM \n\ndomains started crystallizing in the inner portions of the body, the exsolved fluids would have diffused \n\naway from the anhydrous intergrowth in a self-organized fashion, enriching the residual melt in water \n\nand decreasing its viscosity. The fluid might have escaped through open spaces as horizontal cooling \n\ncracks (Figs. 7e and f). As this process progressed, multiple discrete zones with contrasting rheology \n\ndeveloped, separating high viscosity MM-dominated zones and low viscosity fluid-enriched zones. \n\nThe driving force for this zonation was probably flow-induced shearing within the lava due to gradual \n\nviscosity rise. The same mechanism might explains the sub-horizontal, yet irregular, stretched \n\ngeometry of the flow bands, parallel to the flow direction. Thus, MM-dominated domains apparently \n\nachieved their rheological lock-up early and crystallized to originate the dark bands. The residual \n\nfluid-enriched zones remained plastic and developed an interconnected permeable network that \n\nallowed open-system degassing, precluding explosive activity. This interpretation is supported by \n\noutcrop relationships in which light bands locally cross-cut dark bands. The sinuous and diffusive \n\nnature of the contacts between distinct bands are assigned to the very high magmatic temperatures, \n\nwhich enabled healing and interfingering between the two described rheological domains.   \n\nThe different colors on both bands are probably a late to post-magmatic feature related to different \n\nporosities or mineralogical abundances (Fig. 12; Table 7). The awkward \u201cvuggy\u201d aspect of the \n\nfeldspars in the PM domains could result from an extreme case of non-radiating spherulite \n\ncrystallization due to very high undercooling rates. We do not discard the possibility of selective \n\nhydrothermalism, that would have led to quartz leaching and leaving the vuggy feldspar behind \n\n(dequartzification; e.g. Cathelineau, 1986; Petersson &amp; Eliasson, 1997). To our knowledge, none such \n\nsimilar texture has been described to date.  \n\n \n\n5.6  Petrogenetic Insights \n\nThe analyzed rocks show 10-15% of plagioclase macrocrysts without any appreciable optical \n\nzoning. The homogeneity in CSD curves indicate that the large plagioclase crystals resided in a deep-\n\nseated reservoir under supersolidus conditions up to 40 years (Table 9). Plagioclase crystals show \n\nremarkably similar  textural histories which, together with homogeneous Sr isotope signatures indicate \n\nthat they shared a common deep reservoir where they grew as true phenocrysts, given that isotope \n\nsignatures coincide with whole-rock data (Davidson et al., 2007).   \n\nWe interpret plagioclase + pyroxene clusters described here are interpreted as disrupted mushy \n\nmargins of the magmatic chamber and, in this sense, represent cumulate fragments or autholits. \n\nSimilar occurrences have been described in intraplate silicic ignimbrites elsewhere (e.g. Barbey et al., \n\n2005; Ellis &amp; Wolf, 2012; Ellis et al., 2014). Very high magmatic temperatures, high crystallinity and \n\nlimited interaction with the surrounding melt prevented plagioclase growth and enabled textural \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nmaturation by coarsening of these cumulate fragments, as suggested by lobate and healed contacts. On \n\nthe other hand, individual euhedral plagioclase crystals seem to have grown with available space, \n\nprobably in the inner portions of the chamber, in a cogenetic magmatic system to that envisaged for \n\nthe crystallization of the cumulate fragments, given their coincident chemical and isotopic signatures.  \n\nSubtle fluctuations in the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios in plagioclase suggest protracted melt supply in the \n\nmagmatic chamber. These recharge/reinjection events by similar cogenetic magma batches would \n\nredistribute the cumulate fragments and induce turbulence within the chamber, favoring \n\nhomogenization. Moreover, it would prevent rapid cooling and provide the heat required for the long-\n\nlived crystallization interval of the plagioclase phenocrysts (Table 9). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n \n\n6  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS \n\n Plagioclase phenocrysts from the trachydacites of the Guarapuava region occur preferably as \n\nsingle euhedral and unzoned crystals. There is a rare but common association of plagioclase in \n\nmultimineralic clusters containing pyroxene \u00b1 Fe-Ti oxides. Combined petrography (via optical \n\nmicroscopy, SEM and CL) and CSD studies enabled the recognition of two distinct environments of \n\nplagioclase crystallization: one under deep-seated conditions with local action of coarsening, \n\nresponsible for the crystallization of plagioclase phenocrysts and cumulate fragments or autholits, and \n\nanother one at the shallow and/or surface level, responsible for the crystallization of plagioclase \n\nmicrophenocryst population. Magmatic timescales of crystallization of phenocrysts and \n\nmicrophenocrysts varied from a few tens of years (&lt;40 years; G = 10 \n-9\n\nmm.s\n-1\n\n) to less than 2 years (G \n\n= 10\n-8 \n\nmm.s\n-1\n\n), respectively. Plagioclase Sr isotopes showed a very subtle inter- and intracrystalline \n\nvariation, with \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios overlapping with whole-rock isotopy, implying a relatively monogenetic \n\nmagmatic system throughout GAV evolution.  \n\nThe irregular flow banding observed in the majority of the GAV outcrops revealed to be defined by \n\nsinuous dark and light bands with distinct textures and mineral abundances. This structure formed \n\nduring syn-eruptive degassing of the GAV magmas and heterogeneous distribution of water within it, \n\nleading to discrete zones organized in centimeter scale with distinct rheology. Banding is marked by \n\nalternation of porous and massive domains and the first probably result from the self-organized fluid \n\nexsolution that might have led to selective hydrotermalism and quartz leaching. Based on the intensive \n\nand rheological parameters calculated for the studied rocks, we argument an effusive eruptive style for \n\nthe rocks outcropping in the Guarapuava region.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n7 REFERENCES \n\nANDERSON, A.
