However, coconut water is \na highly perishable product due to the presence of enzymes such as peroxidase \nand polyphenoloxidase, which cause undesirable changes in colour, and also \nbecause of its susceptibility to microbial spoilage. The use of chemical additives \nhas been adopted by the industry with the intent of increasing product shelf life. \nIn this study, the efficiency of the preservatives potassium sorbate and sodium \nmetabisulphite was assessed using a Central Composite Rotational Design (CCRD) \nto determine the stability of carbonated coconut water, varying the concentrations \nof potassium sorbate from 0 to 500 mg.L\u20131, and of sodium metabisulphite from \n0 to 100 mg.L\u20131. The chemical evaluations included carbonation volume, pH, \nsoluble solids, dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide, acidity, ascorbic acid, \npolyphenoloxidase and peroxidase activities, colour and turbidity attributes. \nThe microbiological evaluations considered the total aerobic plate count and \nthe enumeration of yeasts and moulds. It was observed that concentrations of \n375 mg.L\u20131 of potassium sorbate and 75 mg.L\u20131 of sodium metabisulphite gave \nthe best quality attributes with respect to minor changes in acidity and colour \nof the coconut water, providing that the raw material had low microbiological \ncontamination.\n\nKey words: Coconut water; Carbonation; Potassium sorbate; Sodium \nmetabisulphite; Microbiological quality.\n\nResumo\n\nA \u00e1gua de coco \u00e9 muito popular em todo o mundo, principalmente em virtude \ndas suas caracter\u00edsticas sensoriais agrad\u00e1veis, do valor nutricional e das baixas \ncalorias.

They are \nalso used in the control of microorganisms as antioxidants \nor reducing agents, amongst other functions. However, \ndue to its adverse health effects, the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) limits the use of sulphur dioxide \n(SO\n\n2\n) in processed food products to a maximum daily \n\ndose of 0.7 mg.kg\u20131 of body mass (QUEIROZ et al., 2008; \nFAO, 1967).\n\nAlthough sulphur dioxide and sulphites are \ngenerally recognized as safe (GRAS) substances, their \nuse in wines is limited to 0.035 % because higher levels \ncould lead to undesirable flavours. The use of sulphites \nis not allowed in foods that are considered as sources of \nthiamine since they inactivate this vitamin (MAGA and TU, \n1994; MITCHELL, 1990).\n\nAccording to Maga and Tu (1994), the intake \nof sulphite at normal levels in foods does not result in \naccumulation in the body, because it is rapidly oxidized \ninto sulphate and excreted in the urine. However, a dose \nabove tolerable levels (such as 62 mg.kg\u20131 of body mass) \nof sulphur dioxide has resulted in neurological problems in \nrats, including polyneuritis, visceral atrophy, bone marrow \natrophy, renal dysfunction and growth limitation. In direct \ncontact with the eyes, SO\n\n2 \nis quickly absorbed and gets \n\ninto the cornea, causing acute inflammation. However, in \ngeneral, no mutagenic, teratogenic or carcinogenic effects \nof SO\n\n2\n have been observed in rats or mice (MAGA and TU, \n\n1994; MITCHELL, 1990). However, sulphites have been \nassociated with asthmatic attacks and other allergenic \neffects, and in extreme cases they are able to cause death \ndue to hypersensitivity.\n\nSorbic acid and sorbates are generally used in the \ncontrol of microorganisms in industrialized food products, \nwith a maximum recommended daily intake of 12.5 mg.kg\u20131 \nof body mass (MITCHELL, 1990; FAO, 1967). For the \nmicrobiological preservation of coconut water, many \nauthors have used pre\u2013determined concentrations of \npreservatives such as: 40 mg.L\u20131 of sodium metabisulphite \n(CARVALHO et al., 2007a, b); 500 and 600 mg.kg\u20131 of \npotassium metabisulphite (CHOWDHURY et al., 2005); \n45 mg.L\u20131 of sodium metabisulphite and 124 mg.L\u20131 of \nsodium benzoate (SILVA et al., 2003), despite the fact that \nno study has been carried out to determine the minimum \nconcentration necessary to preserve coconut water.\n\nThe present research analyzed the combined action \nof potassium sorbate at concentrations ranging from 0 to \n500 mg.L\u20131 with sodium metabisulphite at concentrations \nfrom 0 to 100 mg.L\u20131. These concentrations were chosen \nin order to obtain samples containing only one of the \npreservatives and also concentrations above those \n\n1 Introduction\n\nCoconut water is a beverage appreciated worldwide. \nIt is a drink with a slight sweet and acid flavour (pH 5.5), it \nis somewhat cloudy and it is constituted mainly of minerals \nand sugars, and in smaller proportions, by nitrogenous \nsubstances (amino-acids), lipids and vitamins. Due to \nits rich composition in salts, it is considered as a natural \nisotonic drink (MEDINA et al., 1980; MACIEL et al., 1992; \nCAMPOS et al., 1996).\n\nCoconut water is a highly nutritious beverage \nwhich favours microbial spoilage. The product is also \nsusceptible to browning due to high oxido-reductase \nenzyme concentrations such as polyphenoloxidase and \nperoxidase.\n\nPolyphenoloxidase catalyzes two types of oxidative \nreactions: hydroxylation of monophenols into o-diphenols \nand the oxidation of the latter compounds, which are \ncolourless, into dark toned o-quinones (DUARTE et al., \n2002). \n\nPeroxidase, on the other hand, catalyzes a great \nnumber of oxidative reactions using hydrogen peroxide as \nthe substrate, or, in some cases, oxygen as a hydrogen \nacceptor. Peroxidase is considered to be the most \nheat stable vegetable enzyme and its inactivation has \nconventionally been used as an indicator of blanching \nefficacy in vegetable processing (FREITAS et al., 2008).\n\nEnzymatic browning is usually undesirable and \ntherefore chemical and physical methods have been \ndeveloped aiming at its inhibition, which can be achieved \nby the elimination or complexation of one or more essential \ncomponents of the reaction such as oxygen, enzyme, \ncopper or substrate (GUERRERO-BELTR\u00c1N et al., 2005).\n\nThe only normative instruction in Brazil concerning \nprocessed coconut water applies to its physicochemical \ncharacteristics (BRASIL, 2009), and there is no specific \nlegislation concerning the use of preservatives for this \nproduct. Thus different compounds are used according \nto the specific legislation for fruit juices, that is, \n0.004 g.100 mL\u20131 of sodium sulphite and 0.03 g.100 mL\u20131 of \nsorbic acid in the carbonated beverages (BRASIL, 2007). \nAscorbic acid is frequently used to prevent enzymatic \nbrowning, and has been shown to be more effective than its \nisomer, iso-ascorbic acid. This acid acts as an antioxidant, \nreducing the quinine produced by polyphenoloxidase, \nand contributing to a drop in the pH value. However, \nascorbic acid can also participate in the non-enzymatic \nbrowning process by forming furfural derivatives in the \npresence of low pH and heating, producing dark pigments \n(QUEIROZ et al., 2008; TORALLES et al., 2008).\n\nIn a study by Abreu and Faria (2007), ascorbic acid \nwas applied at concentrations of 0, 100 and 200 mg.L\u20131, \ntogether with heat treatments varying between 138 and \n144 \u00b0C for 10 seconds. They found that a heat treatment \n\n126, Campinas, v. 16, n. 2, p. 125-132, abr./jun. 2013\n\n\n\nOptimizing the use of potassium sorbate and sodium metabisulphite  \nfor the chemical and microbial stability of carbonated coconut water\n\nPEREIRA, E. P. R. et al.\n\nhttp://bjft.ital.sp.gov.br\n\nBraz. J. Food Technol\n\n(2007). This step consisted of injecting carbon dioxide into \nthe beverage under pressure to obtain the desired degree \nof carbonation. The drink was packaged into PET bottles, \npreviously cleaned with a sodium hypochlorite solution \n(200 mg.L\u20131) and stored at room temperature (20 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) \nfor 62 days. The preservatives were added before \ncarbonation. The concentration used was established by \na Central Composite Rotational Design (CCRD) with two \nindependent variables (potassium sorbate and sodium \nmetabisulphite) at concentrations varying from 0 to \n500 mg.L\u20131 and 0 to 100 mg.L\u20131, respectively, as shown \nin Table 1. The responses obtained were statistically \nanalyzed using the STATISTICA 7 program.\n\n3.1 Evaluation of stability\n\nTo evaluate the stability, the carbonation volume \nw a s  a n a l y s e d  a c c o rd i n g  t o  t h e  A S T M  F 1 1 1 5 - 9 5 \nstandards (ASTM, 2001); the pH was determined using \na Digimed potentiometer (Sao Paulo \u2013 SP, Brazil), model \nDM-20 at 25 \u00b0C; the soluble solids were determined \nusing a portable refractometer (Optech, model RCZ, \nGuarulhos \u2013 SP, Brazil); dissolved O\n\n2\n was assessed using \n\nan O\n2 \nmeter (Mettler Toledo, model MO128, Barueri \u2013 SP, \n\nBrazil); dissolved CO\n2 \nwas evaluated using a CO\n\n2 \nelectrode \n\n(Thermo Scientific, model Orion 720A - represented in \nBrazil by Analyser, Sao Paulo - SP); colour and turbidity \nwere determined in a colorimeter (Hunterlab, model \nColorquest ll, using the CIELAB system with the illuminant \nD65, observer\u2019s angle of 10\u00b0, TTRAN-type calibration and \nHAZE measurement - turbidity).\n\nTitratable acidity was determined based on method \n942.15 of AOAC (HORWITZ, 1997). The ascorbic acid \nconcentration was determined by titrating 10 mL of sample \nwith 50 mL of a 1 % oxalic acid solution standardized \nwith a solution of 2 g.L\u20131 dichloroindophenol (DCFI). A \nspectrophotometer (Beckman, model DU-70) was used \nto determine the peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase \nactivities. For polyphenoloxidase, 1.3 mL of 0.35M \nphosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.7 mL of 0.2M catechol and \n2 mL of the coconut water sample were mixed at room \ntemperature, and the absorbance read at 425 nm in a \nspectrophotometer at zero time and after 10 minutes of \nreaction. For peroxidase, 1.3 mL of 0.35M phosphate \nbuffer (pH 5.5) at 35 \u00b0C was used, and 2 mL of the \ncoconut water sample added together with 0.5 mL of an \nalcoholic solution of 0.5 % guaiacol and 0.2 mL of 0.1 % \nhydrogen peroxide . The absorbance was read at 470 nm \n\npermitted by the Brazilian law. The effect of carbonation \nwas also assessed, since it is generally known to provide \na refreshing sensation and also because of a possible role \nin microbial growth inhibition.\n\n2  Experimental procedures\n\n2.1 Materials\n\nGreen coconuts of the dwarf variety were used with \nmaturity levels of approximately 6 to 7 months, bought from \nthe Central Supply Unit in Campinas \u2013 SP (CEASA), Brazil. \nFor standardization of the coconut water (Brix = 7 \u00b0Brix \nand pH between 4.3-4.5), refined sugar was used as a \nsource of sucrose (Caravelas brand, Usina Colombo, \nAriranha \u2013 SP, Brazil), and citric acid (Synth brand, \nLabsynth, Diadema \u2013 SP, Brazil). Ascorbic acid (Nuclear \nbrand, Casa da Qu\u00edmica, Diadema \u2013 SP, Brazil) was \nused at a concentration of 200 mg.L\u20131, and the chemical \npreservatives potassium sorbate (Vetec brand, Vetec, \nRio de Janeiro \u2013 RJ, Brazil) (varying from 0 to 500 mg.L\u20131) \nand sodium metabisulphite (Synth brand, Labsynth, \nDiadema \u2013 SP, Brazil), (varying from 0 to 100 mg.L\u20131) were \nalso employed.\n\nA s  f o r  t h e  p a c k a g i n g  s y s t e m ,  t r a n s p a re n t \npolyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles were used, \nprovided by Minalba (Minalba, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos - SP). \nThe characteristics of the bottles were: weight of \n16.49 \u00b1 0.05 g, volumetric capacity of 348.58 \u00b1 1.32 mL \nand oxygen permeability of 0.047 \u00b1 0.001 cm3/bottle.\nday.atm at 25 \u00b0C. High density polyethylene screw caps \ncontaining Bericap seal liners (Sorocaba-SP) were used \nto close the bottles,.\n\n3 Methods\n\nBefore extracting the water from the fruits, they \nwere sanitized using a solution of sodium hypochlorite \n(200 mg.L\u20131). The water was then standardized to a \npH between 4.3-4.5 and 7 \u00b0Brix using citric acid and \nsucrose. At this point, 200 mg.L\u20131 of ascorbic acid were \nadded to the water. The drink was clarified by passing \nthrough a 1 ?m pore opening filter, pasteurized at 90 \u00b0C \nfor 30 seconds, and rapidly cooled to 2 \u00b0C in a plate heat \nexchanger (model Micro Plak Jr., manufactured by Suma \nBrand Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio Ltda., Campinas \u2013 SP, Brazil), \nwith a nominal flow rate of 300 L.h\u20131, fed with a positive \ndisplacement pump (Netzsch brand, Pomerode \u2013 SC, \nBrazil).

These results indicated there was \na certain synergism between the two preservatives with \nrespect to microbial control. The other samples, D, F, H \nand K, showed no significant microbial development at \nany point.\n\nFor the yeast and mould counts, samples A, B, C, \nE, G and I presented detectable counts after 30 days \nof storage, with E and G having counts above 105 CFU.\nmL\u20131. After 61 days, there was an increase in the yeast \nand mould counts for samples A, E and G, with E and \nG showing total counts above 106 CFU.mL\u20131, a fact that \nconfirms the efficacy of the combined action provided by \nthe two preservatives.\n\nThe activities of the enzymes polyphenoloxidase \nand peroxidase were not significant in any of the samples \nduring the storage time, indicating that the thermal \nprocessing applied to the samples was sufficient to \ninactivate them. As in the study of Murasaki-Aliberti et al. \n(2004), heat processing with shorter holding times can \nminimize the nutritional and sensory losses in coconut \nwater and promote 90 % enzymatic inactivation.\n\nBased on the present results, concentrations of \n375 and 75 mg.L\u20131 of potassium sorbate and sodium \nmetabisulphite, respectively, caused less changes in all \nthe attributes evaluated. However, such concentrations \nare not allowed by the Brazilian legislation (BRASIL, \n2007), with limits of 260 mg.L\u20131 for potassium sorbate and \n40 mg.L\u20131 for sodium metabisulphite. According to the \npresent results, this combination would also be sufficient \nto preserve the product, and thus additional confirmatory \ntrials were carried out using these concentrations, as well \nas the optimal combination. However, these confirmatory \ntrials showed very high microbiological contamination, \nwith counts of over 108 CFU.mL\u20131 over a period of \n20 days of storage for both samples, indicating that these \nconcentrations of the preservatives were not sufficient to \n\nIn the determination of dissolved CO\n2,\n (Figure 1c), \n\nonly sodium metabisulphite showed a significant \nresponse, with lower concentrations of this preservative \ngiving rise to greater quantities of dissolved gas. As for \nacidity (Figure 1d) only potassium sorbate was significant, \nand the lower its concentration, the higher the acidity \ndeveloped in the sample.\n\nIn the deter mination of ascorbic acid, only \npotassium sorbate showed a significant response, and \nthe lower the concentration of potassium sorbate, the \ngreater the degradation of ascorbic acid, as seen in \nFigure 1e. Lima et al. (2009) also found a decrease in \nascorbic acid concentration in coconut water-acerola \nfruit juice supplemented with caffeine, at a rate of \n1.24 mg.100 mL\u20131.day\u20131.\n\nFor the b* colour attribute, low sodium metabisulphite \nconcentrations, and very low or very high potassium \nsorbate concentrations favoured the development of a \nyellow colour (higher values for b*) (Figure 1f). However \nfor turbidity, only sodium metabisulphite had a significant \neffect, with lower concentrations allowing for the \ndevelopment of more turbidity in the samples (Figure 1g). \nThese results could be associated with the growth of \nmicroorganisms forming gas and acid, since the sample \nwould be less protected due to the lower concentrations \nof preservative, as shown in Table 4.\n\nThe microbiological evaluations of the samples \n(formulations presented in Table 1) were carried out \nat zero time and after 30 and 61 days of storage at \nroom temperature, according to Table 4. Samples A, \nB, C, E and G presented a total microbial count above \n103 CFU.mL\u20131 after 30 days of storage. Samples A, B \nand C showed decreases in the microbial counts after \n61 days, which could be attributed to the start of the \ndecline phase of microbiological development. Samples \nE and G showed an increase in the microbial count at \nthe end of the observation period. With the exception \nof sample B, all the samples contained the lowest \n\nTable 4.

However, such \nconcentrations were above the limits established by \nBrazilian law. For the sample with concentrations of \n260 mg.L\u20131 of potassium sorbate and 40 mg.L\u20131 of sodium \nmetabisulphite, which are the limits established by the \nlegislation, good stability of the carbonated coconut water \nwas observed for approximately 60 days of storage at \nroom temperature, provided the initial microbial counts \nwere low. It was also observed that the samples that \nreceived only one type of preservative presented less \nstability, demonstrating a possible synergistic effect \nbetween potassium sorbate and sodium metabisulphite. \nMoreover, this study showed that the addition of CO\n\n2\n to the \n\ncoconut water, besides giving a more refreshing sensation \nto the beverage, also contributed to its conservation \nbecause it helped to reduce the pH value of the product, \nas well as reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen.\n\nReferences\n\nAMERICAN SOCIETY FOR TESTING AND MATERIALS \u2013 ASTM. \nASTM F1115-95: Standard Test Method for Determining \nthe Carbon Dioxide Loss of Beverage Containers.
