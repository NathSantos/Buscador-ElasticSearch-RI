Apesar de ser uma esp\u00e9cie muito capturada na pesca \noce\u00e2nica de atuns afins, informa\u00e7\u00f5es acerca destes aspectos ecol\u00f3gicos s\u00e3o \nescassas e at\u00e9 mesmo ausentes na literatura relacionada \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie. A tese \u00e9 \napresentada como um conjunto de cap\u00edtulos aut\u00f4nomos, representando artigos \ncient\u00edficos individuais. No primeiro cap\u00edtulo-artigo foram discutidos os poss\u00edveis \nefeitos de medidas de manejo restritivas, implementadas recentemente por \nOrganiza\u00e7\u00f5es Regionais da Pesca Atuneira e que incluem algumas esp\u00e9cies de \ntubar\u00f5es oce\u00e2nicos. Medidas restritivas isoladas ter\u00e3o pouco impacto na redu\u00e7\u00e3o \nda mortalidade de tubar\u00f5es oce\u00e2nicos. Um conjunto de medidas mitigadoras \nintegradas ser\u00e1 mais eficaz na conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e recupera\u00e7\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es dessas \nesp\u00e9cies. No segundo cap\u00edtulo-artigo foram analisados dados de captura e \nesfor\u00e7o de 14.835 lan\u00e7amentos de espinhel pel\u00e1gico realizados por embarca\u00e7\u00f5es \narrendadas da frota atuneira brasileira, nos anos de 2004 a 2010. A CPUE nominal \nexibiu uma tend\u00eancia de aumento gradual ao longo dos anos, variando de 0,04 \nem 2004 para 0,15 em 2010. A CPUE foi padronizada atrav\u00e9s de uma abordagem \ndelta-GLM, entretanto, o \u00edndice de abund\u00e2ncia padronizado n\u00e3o diferiu \nsignificativamente da CPUE nominal. Os modelos indicaram que as capturas de \ntubar\u00f5es galha-branca s\u00e3o maiores para a estrat\u00e9gia de pesca espanhola, que se \ncaracteriza pela utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de anz\u00f3is em profundidades mais rasas. No terceiro \ncap\u00edtulo-artigo, a intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre tubar\u00f5es galha-branca e a pesca de rede de \ncerco nos Oceanos Atl\u00e2ntico e \u00cdndico foi analisada, com o objetivo de investigar o \npotencial da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do banco de dados dessa pescaria para derivar \u00edndices de \nabund\u00e2ncia e determinar tend\u00eancias populacionais para a esp\u00e9cie. Dados de \nobservadores de bordo da frota francesa combinados com dados hist\u00f3ricos da \nUni\u00e3o Sovi\u00e9tica foram utilizados na an\u00e1lise. A s\u00e9rie temporal combinada incluiu os \nanos entre 1986 e 2014. No Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel determinar uma \ntend\u00eancia populacional, uma vez que o \u00edndice de ocorr\u00eancia foi muito baixo e n\u00e3o \nvariou significativamente com o tempo. No Oceano \u00cdndico foi observada uma \nmudan\u00e7a bem-marcada no \u00edndice de ocorr\u00eancia, oscilando em torno de 20% \n\n\n\nentre meados dos anos 80 e 90 e caindo para menos de 10% a partir de 2005. No \nquarto cap\u00edtulo-artigo, a vulnerabilidade do tubar\u00e3o galha-branca \u00e0 pesca de \nespinhel pel\u00e1gico foi avaliada utilizando dados dependentes e independentes da \npesca. Os dados dependentes inclu\u00edram informa\u00e7\u00f5es de di\u00e1rios de bordo (1999-\n2011) e observadores embarcados (2004 a 2010), num total de 65.277 \nlan\u00e7amentos de espinhel. Os dados independentes foram obtidos a partir de 8 \ntubar\u00f5es marcados com marcas do tipo \u201cpop-up satellite archival tag\u201d na \u00e1rea \nonde a frota de espinhel operou. Locais de marca\u00e7\u00e3o e desprendimento das \nmarcas foram relativamente pr\u00f3ximos uns dos outros. Entretanto, os indiv\u00edduos \nmarcados tenderam a viajar longas dist\u00e2ncias antes de retornar para a \u00e1rea de \nmarca\u00e7\u00e3o. Foi observado um certo grau de filopatria \u00e0 \u00e1rea. \u201cHotspots\u201d de alta \nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos tubar\u00f5es marcados correspondeu \u00e0 \u00e1rea sob forte press\u00e3o \npesqueira. Todos os tubar\u00f5es exibiram uma forte prefer\u00eancia por \u00e1guas quentes \ne rasas da camada de mistura, gastando, em m\u00e9dia, mais de 70% do tempo acima \nda termoclina e 95% acima de 120 m. Esse resultado justifica a maior \ncapturabilidade da esp\u00e9cie em espinheis mais rasos. No quinto e \u00faltimo cap\u00edtulo-\nartigo, os movimentos verticais dos tubar\u00f5es marcados foram analisados em \ndetalhe. Apesar da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o vertical restrita, os dados indicaram que o tubar\u00e3o \ngalha-branca apresenta padr\u00f5es de movimento complexos, incluindo padr\u00f5es de \nmigra\u00e7\u00f5es circadianas distintos e mergulhos profundos. O padr\u00e3o circadiano mais \nfrequentemente observado \u00e9 caracterizado de um deslocamento \u00e0 superf\u00edcie \ndurante o nascer do sol e uma tend\u00eancia a permanecer em profundidades mais \nbaixas durante o dia. Os movimentos verticais tamb\u00e9m foram influenciados pela \ntemperatura da superf\u00edcie do mar, o que pode indicar a ocorr\u00eancia de \ntermoregula\u00e7\u00e3o para esp\u00e9cie. A integra\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados de cada cap\u00edtulo-\nartigo proporcionou boas perspectivas para o desenvolvimento de medidas de \nmitiga\u00e7\u00e3o. A evid\u00eancia em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 prefer\u00eancia do tubar\u00e3o galha-branca por \n\u00e1guas quentes e rasas \u00e9 s\u00f3lida, indicando que a remo\u00e7\u00e3o dos anz\u00f3is rasos do \nespinhel pode ser proposta para reduzir a captura incidental da esp\u00e9cie. O fato \nde varia\u00e7\u00f5es na CPUE j\u00e1 terem sido observadas, sugere que esta pode ser uma \nmedida eficaz. O comportamento filop\u00e1trico observado para o OCS tamb\u00e9m \nindica que a esp\u00e9cie pode se beneficiar com a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas marinhas \nprotegidas. \n \nP a l a v r a s - c h a v e :  fauna acompanhante, pesca atuneira, dados de observadores \nde bordo, taxas de capturas, \u00edndice de abund\u00e2ncia, marcas eletr\u00f4nicas, padr\u00f5es \nde movimento, comportamento, medidas mitigadoras. \n\n\n\n \nA b s t r a c t  \n\n \nThe ultimate goal of this thesis was to generate knowledge regarding the ecology \nof the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and contribute for an \necosystem-based fishery management. The work focuses on the interactions \nbetween tuna fisheries and the species and its habitat preferences. Despite being \nfrequently caught on high-sea fisheries, there are wide knowledge gaps regarding \nthe ecology of the oceanic whitetip shark. The thesis is presented as a set of self-\ncontained standalone chapters, constructed as individual research articles. The \nfirst article-chapter provides a discussion concerning pelagic sharks and the \nrecent species-specific banning measures implemented by Regional Fishery \nManagement Organizations (RFMOs) in charge of tuna fisheries. It is unlikely that \nbanning measures alone can reduce the high level of fishing mortality and recover \npelagic shark\u2019s depleted populations. Managers should be fully aware that the \ndevelopment and implementation of mitigation measures are critical for a more \neffective conservation strategy. In the second article-chapter, catch and effort data \nfrom 14,835 longline sets conducted by foreign tuna longline vessels chartered \nby Brazil, from 2004 to 2010, were analyzed. The nominal catch per unit of effort \n(CPUE) exhibited a gradual increase, varying from 0.04 sharks/1000 hooks in \n2004 to 0.15 in 2010. A CPUE standardization was performed using a delta-GLM \napproach, but the standardized index of abundance did not differ significantly \nfrom the nominal CPUE. The models indicated that the catches of oceanic whitetip \nsharks are higher for the Spanish fishing strategy, which is characterized by the \ndeployment of hooks at shallower depths. In the third article-chapter, the \ninteraction between oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery in the \neastern Atlantic and western Indian oceans was analyzed, in order to investigate \nthe potential of using this fishery\u2019s database to derive abundance indexes and \ndetermine population trends for the species. Observer data from the French purse \nseine fleet combined with a historic database from the Soviet Union were used in \nthe analyses. The combined time series spanned from 1986 to 2014. The \noccurrence index was very low for Atlantic Ocean and no marked temporal trend \nwas observed. For the Indian Ocean a well-marked change on the occurrence \nindex was observed, fluctuating around 20% from mid 80\u2019s to mid 90\u2019s and \ndropping to less than 10% as from 2005. In the fourth article-chapter, a \n\n\n\ncombination of fisheries dependent and independent data was used to assess the \nvulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark to pelagic longline fisheries. Fisheries \ndependent data included information from logbooks (from 1999 to 2011) and on-\nboard observers (2004 to 2010), totaling 65,277 pelagic longline sets. Fisheries \nindependent data were obtained from 8 oceanic whitetip sharks tagged with pop-\nup satellite archival tags in the area where longline fleet operated. Tagging and \npop-up sites were relatively close to each other, although individuals tended to \ntravel long distances before returning to the tagging area. Some degree of \nphilopatry was observed. High utilization hotspots of tagged sharks fell inside the \narea under strongest fishing pressure. All sharks exhibited a strong preference for \nthe warm and shallow waters of the mixed layer, spending on average more than \n70% of the time above the thermocline and 95% above 120 m. This result explains \nthe higher catchability of the species on shallow longline gear. In the fifth and last \narticle-chapter, the vertical movements of tagged oceanic whitetip sharks were \nanalyzed in detail. Despite its restricted vertical distribution, the analyses reveled \nthat oceanic whitetips perform complex movement patterns, including distinct \ndiel patterns and deep diving behavior. A correlation between vertical \nmovements and sea surface temperature was also observed, suggesting the \noccurrence of thermoregulation for the species. The combined results of each \narticle-chapter have provided good insights towards the development of \nmitigation measures. The evidence regarding oceanic whitetip shark\u2019s preference \nfor warm and shallow waters is solid and this information suggests that the \nremoval of the shallow hooks from the longline gear could be proposed as a \ntechnique to reduce OCS bycatch. The fact that CPUE variations were already \nobserved suggests that this might be an effective measure. The philopatric \nbehavior observed for the OCS also indicates that the species could benefit from \ntime-area closure measures. \n \n \nK e y w o r d s :  bycatch, tuna fisheries, observer data, catch rates, abundance index, \nelectronic tagging, movement patterns, behavior, mitigation measures. \n\n\n\nT a b l e  o f  c o n t e n t s  \n \n \nR e s u m o   \nA b s t r a c t   \n\nC h a p t e r  1  -  G e n e r a l  i n t r o d u c t i o n  1 \n1.

G l o b a l  \n\n \n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and \n\nFlora (CITES) has, on its latest meeting on March 2013, moved the oceanic \n\nwhitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus, FAO 3 alpha code = OCS) from \n\nappendix III to II (CoP16 Prop. 42). CITES is an international agreement between \n\ngovernments aiming to ensure that international trade of wild fauna and flora \n\ndoes not threaten their survival. Species listed on appendix II are considered \n\nthreatened and their international trade must be closely controlled in order to \n\navoid utilization incompatible with their survival. The inclusion of the OCS on \n\nappendix II was proposed by Brazil, Colombia and the United States. The \n\napproval of this proposal is a result of the widespread increase of public \n\nawareness regarding the conservation status of this shark species. \n\n \n\nConcerns regarding the conservation of the oceanic whitetip shark started to rise \n\nsubstantially from 2006 when the species was classified as vulnerable by the IUCN \n\nred list of threatened species worldwide and critically endangered in the \n\nnorthwest and western central Atlantic Ocean. This status was mainly defined due \n\nto increasing fishing pressure throughout the species range and due to lack of \n\nknowledge and adequate monitoring (Baum et al., 2006). In 2010, the \n\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) decided \n\nto ban landings, storing, and selling of the OCS in the Atlantic Ocean (Rec. 10-07). \n\nFollowing this resolution, similar measures were adopted in the Eastern and \n\nWestern Pacific and Indian oceans, by their respective Regional Fishery \n\nManagement Organizations (RFMO): the Inter American Tropical Tuna \n\nCommission on January 1st 2012 (IATTC Rec. C-11-10), the Western and Central \n\nPacific Fisheries Commission on January 1st 2013 (WCPFC CMM 11-04) and the \n\nIndian Ocean Tuna Commission on January 1st 2014 (IOTC Res. 13\u201306). \n\n \n\n 2 \n\n\n\nChapter 1: General introduction \n\nAll of these conservation measures, including the recent listing on CITES appendix \n\nII, were taken under the precautionary approach concept and represent a first \n\nstep towards the preservation of oceanic whitetip sharks worldwide. Knowledge \n\ngaps concerning the species ecology and biology are still wide, imposing a \n\nbarrier on the development of mitigation measures for fisheries and accurate \n\nstock assessments. To bridge these gaps, scientific research is now greatly \n\nencouraged. \n\n \n\n1 . 2 .  N a t i o n a l  \u2013  B r a z i l  \n\n \n\nIn 2008, around 550,000 tons of tuna and tuna-like species were caught in the \n\nAtlantic Ocean by both artisanal and industrial fisheries (ICCAT, 2010). These \n\nspecies included yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and \n\nskipjack tunas (Katsuwonus pelamis), swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and other teleost \n\nfishes and several species of pelagic sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinus sp.). \n\nDuring the same year, the Brazilian fleet caught 35,000 t of large pelagic fishes, or \n\nthe equivalent of 6% from the whole Atlantic Ocean catches. Skipjack tuna \n\nrepresents almost two thirds of the Brazilian catches and has the lower \n\ncommercial value when compared to other tuna species and the swordfish. From \n\nan economic point of view, those numbers reflect in sub-optimal revenue (Hazin, \n\n2010). Brazil is strategically located in relation to the main migration routes of \n\ntuna and tuna-like stocks in the South Atlantic (Hazin and Travassos, 2006). Taking \n\ninto account the great extension of Brazil\u2019s coastline, with approximately \n\n8,500 km, and its proximity with major fishing grounds, it is clear that the position \n\ncurrently occupied by the country in the scenario of open ocean fisheries is not \n\njustified (CGEE, 2008). While fishing vessels operating from Brazilian ports reach \n\nareas of occurrence of tuna schools within hours of navigation, long distance \n\nfishing fleets from countries with consolidated fishing tradition, such as Japan, \n\nTaiwan, Korea, Spain and Portugal, are required, in some cases, to navigate more \n\nthan 20,000 km to reach the same fishing grounds. The Brazilian government has \n\nbeen strongly investing to develop its fishery sector and due to the depletion of \n\n 3 \n\n\n\nChapter 1: General introduction \n\nmost coastal stocks (Dias-Neto, 2003) and to the high commercial value of tuna \n\nspecies, open ocean fisheries have become a priority (Hazin and Travassos, 2006). \n\nInvestments on the Brazilian fishery sectors include many fronts with great focus \n\nbeing put into research, including biology and ecology of target and bycatch \n\nspecies as well as oceanography, development of new technology and \n\nqualification of manpower. \n\n \n\nAs highly migratory species, tuna stocks are managed by RFMOs. In the case of \n\nthe Atlantic Ocean ICCAT is the entity responsible, from which Brazil is a member \n\nsince its foundation at Rio de Janeiro in 1966. Since then, being able to comply \n\nwith ICCAT recommendations and resolutions is one of the basic principles for \n\nBrazil. Conservation issues have always been included in Brazil\u2019s agenda, specially \n\nregarding the vulnerable group of pelagic sharks species. Brazil was one of the \n\nfirst countries to adopt a legislation to ban the shark finning practice already in \n\n1998 (IBAMA decree, N\u00ba 121, August 24 of 1998). A national plan of action for the \n\nconservation and management of sharks (NPOA Shark) was proposed in 2011 and \n\nis currently being implemented (Dias-Neto, 2011). The oceanic whitetip shark is \n\nrelatively common in the catches of the Brazilian tuna longline fleet (Fr\u00e9dou et al., \n\n2015) and due to the strong signs of depletion regarding its population status \n\nBrazil has actively acted on the behalf of its conservation. The ICCAT banning \n\nrecommendation (Rec. 10-07) was supported by biological studies conducted by \n\nBrazil and (Tambourgi et al., 2013), as mentioned in the previous item, Brazil was \n\nalso one of the head countries proposing the listing of the OCS on CITES \n\nappendix II. Following the approval of CITES proposal, Brazil also adopted a \n\nnational banning law for the species (Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture\u2013MPA \n\nand Ministry of the Environment-MMA normative instruction, N\u00ba1, March 12 of \n\n2013). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 1: General introduction \n\n2 .  S t a t e  o f  t h e  a r t  \n \n\nThe Chondrichthyans, or cartilaginous fish, form a relative small group with \n\napproximately 1,115 described species, including sharks, rays and chimaeras \n\n(Compagno et al., 2005). Pelagic species represent 6% of this group and of those \n\nroughly 30 inhabit oceanic regions (Camhi, 2009). The also called elasmobranchs \n\nare known for their k-strategist life cycle, which is characterized by slow growth, \n\nhigh longevity, late sexual maturity and low fecundity (Hoenig and Gruber, 1990). \n\nDue to these characteristics, elasmobranch species exhibit low population growth \n\nrates (Cort\u00e9s, 2000), which makes them much more vulnerable to overfishing \n\nwhen compared to teleost fish (Frisk et al., 2005; Musick et al., 2000). \n\n \n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing concern about the deteriorating status \n\nof the world\u2019s pelagic shark populations (Cort\u00e9s et al., 2010; Dulvy et al., 2008; \n\nWorm et al., 2013). Whereas there is some uncertainty about the precise status of \n\nthese species, there is no doubt that shark populations have declined significantly \n\n(Baum and Blanchard, 2010; Baum and Myers, 2004; Baum et al., 2003; \n\nSimpfendorfer et al., 2008). It is, therefore, important that management measures \n\nare in place to ensure the future sustainability and prevent further population \n\ncollapse. Open ocean sharks and rays are relatively numerous and play an \n\nimportant role in the food webs of the high seas, but, as wide-ranging animals that \n\nspend most of their lives far from land these species have received less research \n\nattention than their coastal relatives (Pikitch et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nMost of the world\u2019s shark catches are incidental, constituting bycatch that is either \n\ndiscarded at sea or landed for sale. Within the fishing methods with the upmost \n\nincidence of elasmobranchs are high-seas pelagic longlines, gillnets and purse \n\nseines targeting mainly tuna and/or swordfish (Bonfil, 1994; Camhi et al., 2008). \n\nThe historically low economic value of shark products compared to the target \n\nspecies has resulted in fewer incentives for research and conservation (Barker and \n\n 5 \n\n\n\nChapter 1: General introduction \n\nSchluessel, 2005). Global concern on this matter, however, has been growing over \n\nthe past decade (Pikitch and Camhi, 2003). Although statistics concerning shark\u2019s \n\ncatches are very scarce, it is noteworthy that representatives of the Carcharhinidae \n\nfamily are amongst the most commonly captured species. These pelagic shark \n\nspecies include the oceanic whitetip (C. longimanus), silky (C. falciformis), and \n\nblue sharks (P. glauca), which are also considered the most abundant ones within \n\ntheir group (Compagno, 1984). \n\n \n\nThe oceanic whitetip shark is easily distinguishable from the other species of the \n\nCarcharhinidae family by the round shape of its long pectoral and dorsal fins, as \n\nwell as by the white stains in their margins (Compagno, 1984). Their large fins are \n\nhighly valued in international trade making them an important target of this \n\nmarket (Camhi, 2009; Clarke et al., 2006). Once considered amongst the most \n\nabundant oceanic sharks, the oceanic whitetip is now commonly perceived as \n\nrare. Inadequate monitoring makes the estimates of their populations very difficult \n\nbut there is a scientific general consensus that populations are decreasing (Baum \n\net al., 2006). \n\n \n\nDespite its worldwide distribution and frequent catches on most high seas pelagic \n\nfisheries, little has been published on the biology and ecology of the oceanic \n\nwhitetip shark. The first few studies were conducted more than 50 years ago, in \n\nthe western North Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific Ocean, including general \n\ninformation on diet, reproduction and behavior (Backus et al., 1956; Strasburg, \n\n1958). Since then, however, very little was added until the past decade when \n\nmore detailed biological studies were published (Lessa et al., 1999a, 1999b; Seki \n\net al., 1998). It was not until very recent that new information regarding oceanic \n\nwhitetip shark\u2019s started to become available again, these included movement \n\npatterns, temperature preferences and biology studies (Howey-Jordan et al., \n\n2013; Madigan et al., 2015; Musyl et al., 2011; Tambourgi et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n 6 \n\n\n\nChapter 1: General introduction \n\nIn the past year, a first stock assessment was conducted for the oceanic whitetip \n\nshark in the Pacific Ocean (Rice and Harley, 2012). It was concluded that either \n\noverfishing is occurring or the stock is overfished and the greatest impact on the \n\nstock was attributed to bycatch from the longline fishery, with lesser impacts from \n\npurse seining. Considering the bycatch nature of fishery impacts, it was advised \n\nthat mitigation measures could provide the best opportunity to improve the status \n\nof the oceanic whitetip population, as it has being suggested for shark species in \n\ngeneral (Gilman et al., 2008). The development of new research regarding stock \n\nstructure, behavior, post-release survival, female maturity, improvement of basic \n\ncatch and effort data, among others, was also advised. The deficiency of such \n\ninformation prevented similar analyses for being conducted for the Atlantic \n\n(Cort\u00e9s et al., 2010) and Indian Ocean stocks. \n\n \n\n3 .  T h e s i s  o u t l i n e   \n \n\nThis work is product of an international research cooperation between France, \n\nthrough the Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD) and Brazil, through \n\nthe Departamento de Pesca e Aquicultura of the Universidade Federal Rural de \n\nPernambuco (UFRPE). The aim of this international cooperation is to mitigate the \n\nadverse ecological impacts caused by open ocean fisheries in the Atlantic and \n\nIndian oceans, with focus on the bycatch issue of tuna fisheries. \n\n \n\nThe thesis is presented as a set of self-contained standalone chapters, constructed \n\nas individual research articles. Consequently, styles might vary and references, as \n\nwell as other components, may occasionally be repeated to accommodate the \n\nstyles of different journals. Following this first introductory chapter, five article-\n\nchapters are presented. These chapters address ecological and conservation \n\nissues regarding the oceanic whitetip shark. The ultimate goal was to generate \n\nknowledge and contribute for an ecosystem-based fishery management (Gilman \n\net al., 2014; Pikitch et al., 2004). A closing chapter, integrating the main findings \n\n 7 \n\n\n\nChapter 1: General introduction \n\nof each article-chapter is also presented. An overview of each article-chapter is \n\ngiven below. \n\n \n\nChapter 2 provides a discussion concerning pelagic sharks and the recent \n\nspecies-specific banning measures implemented by Regional Fishery \n\nManagement Organizations (RFMOs) in charge of tuna fisheries. These measures \n\ninclude retention bans, finning bans and trading bans. The positive and negative \n\naspects of such measures are analyzed inside of two distinct scenarios: one where \n\npelagic sharks are the targeted species and other where they represent the \n\nbycatch component. The main objective was to alert managers that banning \n\nmeasures are not the final step towards the conservation of pelagic sharks, but \n\nrather the initial one. \n\n \n\nIn Chapter 3, catch and effort data from the Brazilian tuna longline fleet were \n\nanalyzed. This chapter provides information on size, distribution and catch rates of \n\nthe oceanic whitetip sharks caught by this fishery. Data was analyzed with regards \n\nto year, season and fishing strategy. Little is known in relation to the spatial \n\ndistribution and relative abundance of the species. Understanding how oceanic \n\nwhitetip sharks interact with the fishery will help on the development of mitigation \n\nmeasures to prevent their capture. \n\n \n\nFollowing the idea behind Chapter 3, Chapter 4 provides an analysis of the \n\ninteraction between oceanic whitetip sharks and the tuna purse seine fishery. \n\nCatch and effort data form the French fleet operating in the eastern Atlantic and \n\nwestern Indian oceans were available for this analysis. Additional historic data \n\nfrom the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean was also included. The main objective \n\nwas to investigate the potential of using this fishery\u2019s database to derive \n\nabundance indexes and determine population trends for the species. \n\n \n\nIn Chapter 5, a combination of fisheries dependent and independent data was \n\nused to assess the vulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark to pelagic longline \n\n 8 \n\n\n\nChapter 1: General introduction \n\nfisheries. Fisheries independent data consisted on information collected with the \n\nuse pop-up satellite archival tags. These tags provide information on depth, water \n\ntemperature and ambient light level (for estimation of geolocation) experienced \n\nby the tagged individuals. Sharks were tagged in the same area where the \n\nBrazilian longline operates, thus the fisheries dependent data comes from this \n\nfishery. Vulnerability was assessed with regards to both spatial dynamics \n\n(horizontal) and depth distribution (vertical) of both shark and longline gear, \n\ntaking into consideration seasonality and strategies in the fishery. The overall goal \n\nwas to provide information to aid in the design of mitigation measures and \n\nimprove conservation efforts for the species. \n\n \n\nFinally, Chapter 6 provides a detailed analysis of the vertical movements of the \n\ntagged oceanic whitetip sharks. Most of the recently published information \n\ndescribing depth and temperature preferences for the species consisted on \n\ngeneral summaries only (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; Musyl et al., 2011). Vertical \n\nmovements were not explored in detail. The aim of this chapter was to describe \n\npotential diel cycles, highlighting similar and contrasting patterns amongst \n\nindividuals. An analysis of the species vertical occupation with regards to \n\nenvironmental variables, especially the temperature structure in the water column, \n\nis also provided. \n\n \n\n4 .

As a result, a series of species-\nspecific banning measures have been implemented by Regional Fishery \nManagement Organizations (RFMOs) in charge of tuna fisheries, which include \nretention bans, finning bans and trading bans. There are both positive and \nnegative aspects to most management measures, but generally, the positive \naspects outweigh the negatives, ensuring the measure is beneficial to the \nresource and its users in the long term. Banning measures are a good first step \ntowards the conservation of pelagic shark species, especially since they improve \nconservation awareness among fishers, managers and the public. Measures that \nimpose total bans, however, can lead to negative impacts that may jeopardize the \npopulations they were intended to protect. The majority of pelagic shark catches \nare incidental and most sharks die before they reach the vessel or after they are \nreleased. The legislation set out by RFMOs only prevents retention but not the \nactual capture or the mortality that may occur as a result. Managers should be fully \naware that the development and implementation of mitigation measures are \ncritical for a more effective conservation strategy. \n \n\n1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  \n \n\nAs populations of highly migratory species decline due to over-exploitation or \n\nother human induced causes, management measures are often implemented to \n\naid their conservation and restore populations to pre-existing levels (Hoffmann et \n\nal., 2010). Such measures have a variety of forms, typically linked to the level of \n\nconcern surrounding the population in question. Generally, as concerns become \n\nincreasingly severe, management measures follow suit and often conclude with \n\ntotal bans \ton harvesting and global trade of a species. While these measures are \ngenerally believed to aid in species conservation, they can, at times, lead to \n\nincreased pressure on the population at risk (Rivalan et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nRecently, declining populations of several pelagic shark species have led to global \n\nconservation concerns surrounding this group (Fowler et al., 2005; Dulvy et al., \n\n2008; Aires-da-Silva and Gallucci, 2008; Cort\u00e9s et al., 2010). These sharks are \n\n 14 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\nboth targeted and taken incidentally as bycatch by a range of fleets from coastal \n\nartisanal to industrial vessels operating in distant waters (Bonfil, 1994; Wormet al., \n\n2013). An inherent issue with exploitation of elasmobranch species, as compared \n\nto their teleost counterparts, is their low rebound capacity resulting directly from \n\ntheir characteristic life history traits of slow growth, late maturation and low \n\nfecundity (Cort\u00e9s, 2000). As such, this group is generally far more vulnerable to \n\noverfishing than teleost fish species (Musick et al., 2002; Compagno et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nWith the increasing conservation concern over this sensitive group, a series of \n\nspecies-specific banning measures have recently been established by Regional \n\nFishery Management Organizations (RFMOs) responsible for the management of \n\ntuna fisheries. These measures include retention bans, finning bans and trading \n\nbans. There are both positive and negative aspects to most management \n\nmeasures, but generally, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives ensuring the \n\nmeasure is beneficial to the resource and its users in the long term. Management \n\nmeasures based on retention, finning or trading bans are no different. Here we \n\nhighlight both the benefits and drawbacks of such measures, in order to assess \n\ntheir overall efficacy and long-term benefit to populations. \n\n \n\n2 .  B a n n i n g  m e a s u r e s  \n \n\nFisheries that target widely distributed and highly migratory species are managed \n\nby international commissions, of which cooperating countries/parties are \n\nmembers. There are five such commissions (RFMOs) that regulate the world\u2019s tuna \n\nfisheries, each with jurisdiction over an ocean/ocean region or target species: the \n\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic tuna (ICCAT), the Indian \n\nOcean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries \n\nCommission (WCPFC), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), \n\noverseeing fishery activity in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the Commission for \n\nthe Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), overseeing all fisheries \n\n 15 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\ntargeting southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus macoyii). Aside from tuna species, these \n\nRFMOs are also usually responsible for the management of any other species \n\ncaught in association with tuna fisheries. Management measures generally stem \n\nfrom the results of annual stock assessments and the advice from scientific \n\ncommittees linked to RFMOs. These measures are set out in the form of \n\nrecommendations or resolutions, which contracting parties are then required to \n\nimplement and report upon. \n\n \n\nTo date, several species-specific management measures have been developed \n\nunder the tuna RFMOs that pertain to the incidental capture of pelagic sharks. \n\nThese measures are hereafter referred to as banning measures. Generally, they \n\nstipulate that all contracting parties shall prohibit retention, transshipment, \n\nlanding or storing any part, or whole carcass, of the species in question. \n\nAdditionally, some of these measures require captured sharks to be promptly \n\nreleased unharmed and/or further state that trading, selling or offering for sale is \n\nalso prohibited (Table 1). As a result, oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), \n\nsilky (C. falciformis), thresher (Alopias spp.) and hammerhead (Sphyrna spp.) \n\nsharks fall under such resolutions in at least one ocean (Table 1). These measures \n\nwere all developed fairly recently by tuna RFMOs (2010\u20132013). The oceanic \n\nwhitetip shark is the only species covered by such measures across all oceans. \n\n \n\nIn addition to RFMO management measures, international treaties also regulate \n\nthe trade of certain marine species. The Convention on International Trade in \n\nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is one such treaty and plays \n\nan important role in managing wildlife. CITES represents an international \n\nagreement among governments that aims to ensure that international trade of \n\nwild fauna and flora does not threaten their survival. In accordance with this \n\nconvention, the international trade of specified species can either be closely \n\ncontrolled (species listed on appendix II) or completely banned (appendix I), \n\ndepending on its population status or vulnerability. During the most recent \n\nmeeting of CITES (March 2013), the oceanic whitetip and hammerhead sharks \n\n 16 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\nwere included in appendix II (CoP16 Prop. 42 and 43), requiring their \n\ninternational trade to be closely controlled. \n\n \n\nT a b l e  1 .

Essentially, the aim \n\nof these measures is to give the stocks the opportunity to recover to pre- \n\nexploitation levels. It is well known, however, that the great majority of pelagic \n\nshark mortality results from their incidental capture in high-seas pelagic longlines, \n\ngillnets and purse seine fisheries that primarily target tuna and tuna-like species \n\n 17 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\n(Gilman et al., 2008; Bonfil, 1994). Nevertheless, sharks are undeniably \n\nconsidered a valuable bycatch in many fleets and are increasingly becoming a \n\ntarget as well (Hareide et al., 2007). The implementation of banning measures in \n\nthese fisheries not only encourages fishers to modify their current practices, but \n\nalso prevents these species from shifting from an incidental catch to a specific \n\ntarget. \n\n \n\nAn increasing number of marine populations are showing signs of recovery after \n\nan advance on conservation efforts, especially through measures that ban trade or \n\nany exploitation activity (Lotze et al., 2011). Marine mammals represent the group \n\nwith the greatest results in terms of conservation success for this ecosystem. A \n\nrecent study has shown that 42% of 92 spatially non-overlapping marine mammal \n\npopulations are significantly increasing as a result of measures that ban their\t\nexploitation and trade (Magera et al., 2013). Whales are, perhaps, the best \n\nexample of this success. The banning regulations set by the International Whaling \n\nCommission (IWC) have reduced whale hunting dramatically and brought most \n\nexploited species out of extinction risk (Magera et al., 2013). Some humpback \n\nwhale populations from the Southern Hemisphere are even expected to reach \n\ntheir estimated pre-whaling abundance levels over the next decade (Gales et al., \n\n2011). \n\n \n\nSuch banning measures, however, can also bring unintended negative effects. By \n\nprohibiting their trade, the products from these species may develop into rare and \n\nluxurious commodities. This perceived rarity could lead to increased consumer \n\ndemand, making their illegal trade highly profitable. In extreme cases, when \n\ndemand is sufficiently high, the protected species could eventually be driven to \n\nextinction (Courchamp et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2008). There is strong evidence that \n\ndemonstrates how moving a species to a more restrictive CITES appendix can \n\nlead to a drastic increase in its illegal trade (Rivalan et al., 2007). During the \n\ntransition period, between initial announcement of such a measure and its final \n\nimplementation into the legislation, trade volumes have been observed to \n\n 18 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\nincrease up to 135% (Rivalan et al., 2007). Furthermore, the black market price of \n\nrhinoceros horn increased by more than 400% within 2 years of their listing under \n\nAppendix I (Rivalan et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nShark fins are highly valued and their trade is currently very profitable. The global \n\nvalue of this market ranges between approximately US$ 400 and 550 million per \n\nyear (Clarke et al., 2007). Being a luxury commodity in Asian cuisine, these species \n\ncould become highly vulnerable should their availability decrease. Fin traders \n\ngenerally distinguish the fins of different shark species (Clarke et al., 2006) and \n\nthe rarity of a particular species could be capitalized upon, although consumers \n\ndo not currently make that distinction. Owing to their large rounded shape and \n\ncharacteristic white marking (Compagno, 1984), the fins of the oceanic whitetip \n\nshark are among the easiest to identify (Clarke et al., 2006), meaning its \n\nvulnerability could increase to dangerous levels should their rarity become an \n\nattractive quality. Additionally, in light of the multitude of conservation regulations \n\nset forth for this species of late, awareness regarding its threatened status has \n\nclearly increased. Once considered amongst the most abundant oceanic sharks, \n\nthe oceanic whitetip is now commonly perceived as rare and there is a wide \n\nconsensus that populations are decreasing (Baum and Blanchard, 2010; Clarke et \n\nal., 2012; Rice and Harley, 2012). Although future scenarios are difficult to predict, \n\nit seems that many of the rarity-associated black market factors described above \n\nare possible for this shark species, especially in light of the global ban on its \n\nretention in pelagic fisheries under tuna RFMO management. \n\n \n\n4 .  I n  w h a t  s c e n a r i o  a r e  b a n n i n g  m e a s u r e s  n o t  \n\ne n o u g h ?  \n \n\nAs stated above, pelagic shark mortality is primarily due to their incidental capture \n\nin high seas fisheries as a result of the shared habitat of pelagic sharks and tunas. \n\nSince retention and trade are banned but not the actual capture, banning \n\n 19 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\nmeasures in their current form will have little impact on Fisher-behavior. As such, \n\ncapture rates are unlikely to change. While mortality rates are both gear and \n\nspecies specific (Skomal, 2007; Campana et al., 2009; Clarke et al., 2013), they are \n\noften high as a large portion of incidentally caught sharks are already dead/dying \n\nby the time they reach the vessel or after release (Rogan and Mackey, 2007; \n\nPoisson et al., 2014a; Hutchinson et al., 2015). \n\n \n\nIn the case of the tropical tuna purse seine fishery, the conditions in the sack of the \n\nnet creates a highly stressful environment, with low oxygen levels and increased \n\ntemperatures, which directly affect the mortality of the catch (Hall and Roman, \n\n2013). Subsequently, the brailing process further reduces the chances of survival \n\nas sharks are compressed between the 2 and 8 tons of tuna in the brail (scoop net \n\nused to load the catch onboard the seiner). Brailed silky sharks were found to \n\nhave an overall mortality rate of 85%, including the ones that appeared to be in \n\nrelatively good condition upon release (Poisson et al., 2014a; Hutchinson et al., \n\n2015). Scalloped hammerhead sharks exhibited one of the lowest survival rates \n\ncompared to other pelagic sharks when caught on pelagic longlines (Gallagher et \n\nal., 2014). The authors considered that the incidental capture of this species in \n\ntuna longline fisheries played an important role in the substantial population \n\ndecline reported for the Northwest Atlantic (Baum et al., 2003). \n\n \n\nWhile it is true that species with high rates of live caught individuals as well as \n\npost release survival could benefit from banning measures, in cases similar to the \n\nsilky and scalloped hammerhead sharks the outcome of these measures alone \n\nwould be rendered biologically ineffective for the recovery of the stocks. \n\nFurthermore, should illegal trade prices be sufficiently high, fishers may be willing \n\nto take the risk of prosecution and retain the sharks (or their fins) for \n\ncommercialization. \n\n \n\nThe complication associated with the mixed capture of target and bycatch species \n\npreclude banning measures from being the final solution for curbing mortality and \n\n 20 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\naiding the recovery of pelagic shark stocks. However, this does not mean that \n\nthese measures provide no benefits. Whenever a banning measure is established, \n\nit directly implies that the population concerned is under severe threat. As such, \n\nthe establishment of a ban indirectly results in improved public awareness \n\nregarding the species\u2019 conservation risk and that extreme action is required for its \n\nprotection. Essentially, such bans can act as an awareness campaign to alert \n\nfishers and consumers who play a crucial role in conservation. In 1990, following \n\nstrong media pressure regarding the mortality of dolphins in the eastern Pacific \n\nOcean by tuna purse seine fisheries, the US Congress approved the Dolphin \n\nProtection Consumer Information Act establishing the use of a \u2018\u2018dolphin safe\u2019\u2019 \n\nlabel on tuna cans which contained tuna not caught in association with dolphins \n\n(Joseph, 1994). A market analysis showed that media pressure and subsequent \n\nimplementation of dolphin-safe labeling affected consumer behavior (Teisl et al., \n\n2002), providing an insight in how public awareness can be a useful tool for \n\nwildlife conservation. This public pressure led to the development of a mitigation \n\ntechnique, the backdown process, where the seiner is put into reverse elongating \n\nthe net and causing the cork line to sink at one extremity. This maneuver allows \n\ndolphins to safely swim away over the sunken corks. Thanks to the backdown \n\nprocess, fishers can still target tuna schools associated with dolphins. The \n\ntechnique is mandatory for tuna purse seiners fishing in the eastern Pacific Ocean \n\n(IATTC) and its compliance is controlled thanks to the presence of onboard \n\nobservers. \n\n \n\nPelagic shark populations could benefit significantly from an increase in public \n\nawareness. In the not too distant past, sharks were seen as little more than a threat \n\nto humans. Although this perception is slowly changing (Simpfendorfer et al., \n\n2011), the need for continued efforts to raise public awareness regarding \n\nconservation requirements is essential and the establishment of species specific \n\nbans will aid in this effort. \n\n \n\n 21 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\n5 .  P o t e n t i a l  s o l u t i o n s  \n \n\nThe incidental nature of shark catches in tuna fisheries worldwide suggest that \n\nmitigation measures are an essential tool for an effective conservation strategy. A \n\nset of integrated measures will more effectively aid in the conservation and \n\nrecovery of threatened pelagic sharks than banning measures alone. These \n\nmeasures should mainly include: (1) the development of alternative fishing \n\ntechniques; and (2) the reduction of fishing effort, e.g. developing spatial or \n\ntemporal management measures such as closed areas/seasons. \n\n \n\nDeveloping techniques that prevent the capture of pelagic sharks is critical. Gear \n\nmodifications have been proved effective in reducing capture and mortality of \n\nsome bycatch species, such as dolphins, seabirds and marine turtles (Coe et al., \n\n1984; Gilman et al., 2006; L\u00f8kkeborg, 2011; Andraka et al., 2013). Gear \n\nmodifications to mitigate pelagic sharks capture represent a real challenge as \n\ntheir distributions and behavior have strong similarities to that of targeted \n\nspecies. However, some techniques that have been proposed could be \n\ninvestigated further. Fishing gears with the highest incidence of incidentally \n\ncaught sharks are gillnets, pelagic longlines and purse seiners. Gillnets together \n\nwith longlines are responsible for the greatest impacts, but very little research has \n\nbeen done to develop mitigation methods to reduce shark bycatch in this fishing \n\ngear (Oliver et al., 2015). More research has been conducted on longline and \n\npurse seine gear. \n\n \n\nIn pelagic longline fisheries, epipelagic species, such as the oceanic whitetip \n\nshark, could benefit from the removal of shallow hooks (Tolotti et al., 2013). This \n\nsimple measure has been shown to reduce the capture of several bycatch species, \n\nwhile also increasing the number of hooks available for the target species (Kitchell \n\net al., 2004; Beverly et al., 2009; Watson and Bigelow, 2014). Rare earth metals \n\nare a potential tool to mitigate shark bycatch, as they can work as a repellent due \n\n 22 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\nto the strong electric field they produce the in water (Stroud, 2007). Much \n\nresearch is still required, however, as this method seems highly complex and \n\nresults can be conflicting as well as species specific (Stoner and Kaimmer, 2008; \n\nRobbins et al., 2011; Hutchinson et al., 2012; Godin et al., 2013). To \n\n \n\nTo reduce the fishery induced mortality of pelagic sharks caught by tropical tuna \n\npurse seiners, it is imperative to direct research efforts at finding ways to release \n\nthem before the retrieval of the net or to attract them away from the tuna \n\naggregation before the net is set. A natural segregation between sharks and tuna \n\ninside the net has been repeatedly observed, which could allow for the \n\nestablishment of a release system (Itano et al., 2012). Preliminary tests were \n\nconducted in the Western Pacific ocean and scientists believe this mitigation \n\nmeasure has potential (Itano et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nAnother relevant issue with purse seine fisheries that has recently been brought to \n\nlight is the exceptionally high rate of silky sharks becoming entangled on the nets \n\nhanging below fish aggregating devices (Filmalter et al., 2013). The construction \n\nof such devices should be controlled and the use of nets needs to be banned. In \n\nfact, several RFMOs have recently adopted recommendations in this regard, \n\nwhich stipulate that the use of netting in the construction of fish aggregating \n\ndevices should be avoided (ex.: IATTC Res.13-04, IOTC Res.13-08). \n\n \n\nThe handling of sharks after capture plays an important role in the survival rate of \n\nreleased individuals. To increase their chances of survival, best handling practices \n\nguides need to be developed for each fishery (see Poisson et al., 2014b as an \n\nexample). Naturally, the development of such guides has to be paired with post \n\nrelease survival studies. Investigating post-release mortality is also an essential \n\npart when assessing the efficacy of banning measures and, although costly, \n\nrequire significant research attention. Once best practices guides are developed, \n\nincentives or disincentives should be promoted in order to facilitate the adoption \n\n 23 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\nof good practices by fishers. Market related incentives, such as eco-labels, could \n\nbe an encouraging tool (ex. MSC certification and ISSF PVR). \n\n \n\nTime area closures have helped the recovery of stocks of a variety of species, from \n\nmarine invertebrates, such as mollusks, to teleost fishes (Lester et al., 2009; \n\nRoberts, 2012; Kerwath et al., 2013). Although most of the successful experiences \n\ncome from coastal fisheries, positive results encourage the investigation of \n\nimplementing such measures for pelagic sharks. The great challenge with pelagic \n\ntime area closures resides on the high mobility of pelagic species and on the lack \n\nof data concerning this complex ecosystem (Game et al., 2009). This means that \n\nthe protected area would have to have exaggerated proportions or target smaller \n\nareas where fishing activities would provoke higher impacts, such as nurseries \n\nand/or spawning zones (Kaplan et al., 2010). Considering the high cost of \n\nenforcement, a targeted time area closure seems more feasible. Watson et al. \n\n(2008) found some promising results regarding silky shark bycatch in the Eastern \n\nPacific Ocean tuna fishery. The authors found that juveniles silky sharks are mostly \n\nconcentrated north of the equator and estimated that area closures could have \n\nreduced up to 33% of the species bycatch while compromising only 12% of the \n\ntuna catch. A similar hotspot of juvenile silky sharks has also been identified in the \n\nIndian Ocean and authors noted that this area does not overlap with the highest \n\ncatch per unit of effort area of the purse seine fisheries (Amand\u00e8 et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nFinally, monitoring is key for any successful management system. There is a \n\nhistory of poor reporting of shark catches, largely due to their incidental nature \n\n(Bonfil, 1994; Camhi et al., 2008; Clarke, 2013; Oliver et al., 2015). Despite \n\nimprovements in recent years (FAO, 2014), notably due to RFMO requirements to \n\nreport shark bycatch (ex. ICCAT Rec.04- 10), a banning measure may jeopardize \n\nthis trend. Under these regulations captains may be inclined not to report the \n\ncapture of a banned species at all as to avoid repercussions, especially if they \n\nhave the intention of illegal commercialization. The current low coverage level of \n\n 24 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\nindependent observers in most high seas fisheries makes this scenario particularly \n\nconcerning (Worm et al., 2013). \n\n \n\nData deficiency is a paramount issue for fisheries management, as stock \n\nassessment methods rely largely on catch and effort time series data (Barker and \n\nSchleussel, 2005). To date, only a handful of stock assessments have been \n\nconducted for pelagic sharks (ICCAT, 2009; Rice and Harley, 2012, 2013). \n\nAdditionally, the results of these assessments are usually interpreted with \n\nconsiderable caution due to the data deficiencies and the resulting high level of \n\nuncertainty of the assessments (Cort\u00e9s et al., 2010). Until every vessel exploiting \n\nthe high seas has some form of independent observer or observation system \n\nonboard, the reliability of such data will remain questionable. Standardized \n\nfisheries independent surveys could be a simple solution to overcoming this issue. \n\nElectronic observation systems still have limitations, especially regarding bycatch \n\nidentification, but promising results indicate this system could also be a useful tool \n\nto improve both monitoring and data collection (Ames et al., 2007; Ruiz et al., \n\n2014) \n\n \n\n6 .  F i n a l  r e m a r k s  \n \n\nThe problem faced in pelagic shark management is a direct result of the way \n\nfishermen catch their fish in an environment shared by target and bycatch species. \n\nThe current fishing methods are not selective enough to avoid catching sharks. \n\nBanning measures in their present form do little to discourage the incidental \n\ncapture of sharks and are unlikely to be effective enough, even with an increase in \n\nrelease numbers, to rebuild stocks. Banning measures are one form of \n\nmanagement, but cannot be the only one applied. They are a positive initial step \n\ntowards the conservation of endangered shark species. They act on a \n\nprecautionary approach basis and also improve conservation awareness among \n\nfishers, managers and the general public. \n\n 25 \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Banning is not enough \n\nBanning measures can provide positive outcomes to the conservation of pelagic \n\nsharks, but their effectiveness is directly linked to whether the species at issue is \n\nthe target of the fisheries or a bycatch component (Fig. 1). For fisheries where \n\nsharks are bycatch, the banning measure would imperatively need to be \n\naccompanied by (i) high observer coverage and (ii) mitigation measures. Viewing \n\nbanning measures as a final solution could result in lowered research incentives \n\nand hamper the further development of appropriate mitigation measures. \n\nFurthermore, without high observer coverage, such a measure could lead to less \n\ncatch data, therefore less monitoring of the impacts of fisheries on these species, \n\nand less opportunities to improve our knowledge on the biology of these species \n\nat risk. We consider that the implementation of high observer coverage is urgent, \n\nespecially on longline fisheries, as well as the adoption of measures that can \n\nreduce the fishing mortality of sharks by avoiding their catch and increasing their \n\nsurvival after release. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nF i g u r e  1 .

The nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) exhibited a gradual increase, \nfrom 0.04 sharks/1000 hooks, in 2004, the first year of the time series, up to 0.13, \nin 2007. In 2008, however, the CPUE increased sharply, reaching 0.43, dropping, \nthen, back to 0.15, in 2010. A CPUE standardization was performed using a delta-\nGLM approach, but the standardized index of abundance did not differ \nsignificantly from the nominal CPUE. The models indicated that the catches of \noceanic whitetip sharks are higher for the Spanish fishing strategy, which is \ncharacterized by the deployment of hooks at shallower depths. These results \nindicate that the use of deep longline hooks (>100 m) may help to mitigate the \nbycatch of this species. \n \n\n1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  \n \n\nThe oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is a circumtropical species \n\nknown as one of the main pelagic sharks worldwide (Bonfil et al., 2008; \n\nCompagno, 1984), being caught as a bycatch by a variety of pelagic fishing gears, \n\nsuch as tuna and swordfish pelagic longlines, pelagic gillnets, and, to a lesser \n\nextent, tuna purse seines (Amande et al., 2011; Bonfil, 1994). It is easily \n\ndistinguishable from the other species of the Carcharhinidae family by the round \n\nshape of its long pectoral and dorsal fins, as well as by the white stains in their \n\nmargins (Compagno, 1984). Their large fins are highly valued in international \n\ntrade and make them a target of this market. \n\n \n\nInadequate monitoring makes the estimates of their populations very difficult but \n\nthere is a general consensus that populations are decreasing (Baum et al., 2006). \n\nThis species is listed vulnerable by IUCN worldwide and even critically \n\nendangered in the northwest and western central Atlantic Ocean. Consequently, \n\nconservation and management actions are urgently required for this species. The \n\n 34 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet \n\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) has \n\nrecently decided to ban the landing, storing, and selling of this species in the \n\nAtlantic Ocean (Rec. 10-07). Similar measures were adopted in the Pacific Ocean \n\nby the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC Rec. C-11-10) and the \n\nWestern and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC CMM 11-04). \n\n \n\nDespite its worldwide distribution and frequent catches in most pelagic fisheries \n\n(Bonfil, 1994) little has been published on the species biology and ecology. Some \n\ngeneral studies, including diet, reproduction and behavior of the oceanic whitetip \n\nshark were conducted in the western North Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific \n\nOcean, more than fifty years ago (Backus et al., 1956; Strasburg, 1958). Since \n\nthen, however, very little was added to the knowledge on the species until the \n\npast decade when new data from the South Atlantic was published by Lessa et al. \n\n(1999a,b), Domingo et al. (2007) and Coelho et al. (2009). \n\n \n\nMost of the information available for the South Atlantic, however, is related to \n\nbiological aspects (morphometry, reproduction, age and growth), with very little \n\nknown in relation to its spatial distribution and relative abundance. The present \n\nstudy analyses data from foreign tuna longline fleets chartered by Brazil, with the \n\ngoal to assess distribution, catch rates and size composition of the oceanic \n\nwhitetip shark in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean in order to fill \n\ngaps on species knowledge and to help define appropriate measures for their \n\nconservation. \n\n \n\n2 .  M a t e r i a l  a n d  m e t h o d s  \n \n\nCatch and effort data from 14,835 longline sets conducted by foreign tuna \n\nlongline vessels chartered by Brazil, from 2004 to 2010 were analyzed. Longline \n\nsets were distributed in a wide area of the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic \n\nOcean, ranging from 10\u00b0N to 35\u00b0S and from 007\u00b0E to 045\u00b0W. Data were obtained \n\n 35 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet \n\nfrom logbooks filled out by on-board observers of the Brazilian National Observer \n\nProgram. Logbooks contained information on the number of hooks, the number \n\nof fish caught, by species, and the geographic position at the beginning of each \n\nset. \n\n \n\nThe Brazilian National Observer Program aims to collect precise information on \n\nfishing strategy, catch composition and biological samples from catches taken by \n\nforeign vessels chartered by Brazil. In this study, logbook information was \n\nobtained from the chartered fleet operating off northeast Brazil for which there is \n\n100% observer coverage. These chartered vessels make up for approximately \n\n30% of the whole foreign and Brazilian longline fleet and almost 60% of the fleet \n\nbased in the northeast. \n\n \n\nDuring the period analyzed, six different flags were active: Spain, Panama, \n\nMorocco, United Kingdom, Honduras, and Portugal. However, they can be \n\ndivided into two distinct fishing strategies, Spanish and Japanese. The first (Spain, \n\nMorocco, Honduras and United Kingdom) aims for swordfish and operates during \n\nthe night with surface longlines (down to 100 m) using light attraction and squid \n\nas bait. The latter (Panama and Portugal) aims for tuna species and operates early \n\nin the morning with deep longlines (down to more than 200 m) using small \n\npelagic fish as bait (mainly mackerel). \n\n \n\nNominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) was calculated as the number of \n\nsharks/1000 hooks by year and by quarters (years combined). For the spatial \n\ndistribution of the CPUE the catch and effort data were grouped into 5\u00b0\u00d75\u00b0 \n\nsquares of latitude and longitude. In this case, the CPUE was calculated by the \n\nsum of all catch and all effort in each square. Information regarding discards of \n\nthis species were not available, thus CPUE was calculated based only in the \n\nretained catches.  \n\n \n\n 36 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet \n\nIn order to account for the possible influences of seasonality, area and fishing \n\nstrategy on CPUE annual variability, a standardization was performed assuming \n\nnegative binomial and delta-lognormal distributions. The evaluation of residual \n\nplots indicated that the delta-lognormal outperformed the negative binomial \n\nmodel and therefore the delta-lognormal was chosen as the preferred model. In \n\nthe delta-GLM approach the presence\u2013absence (PA) of fish in the data set was \n\nmodeled assuming a binomial distribution, while the proportion of positive \n\ncatches (POS) was modeled assuming a lognormal distribution. Year, fishing flag \n\nand quarter, expressed as categorical variables, and the interaction between \n\nlatitude and longitude, expressed as continuous variables, were used as \n\nexplanatory variables for both presence\u2013absence and positive catch models. \n\nFishing flag was represented by two categories: Japanese (JAP) and Spanish \n\n(ESP). These were defined based on the two configurations of fishing gear \n\nemployed by the fleet analyzed in this study. The indices per year for these two \n\nmodels were multiplied in order to obtain the overall index of abundance. \n\nConfidence intervals for the overall index of abundance were calculated using the \n\ndelta method (Lo et al., 1992). \n\n \n\nFrom 2005, additional data on sex, total length (TL), fork length (FL) and inter-\n\ndorsal (ID) length were also collected. All lengths were obtained by laying the fish \n\non the deck and measuring it in a straight line. Whenever the TL was not available, \n\nthe FL and the ID were converted to TL by linear regressions estimated with the \n\navailable data from the present research (Table 1). A total of 1612 individuals \n\nwere measured, representing 64% of the oceanic whitetip sharks caught (2491) \n\nand 1218 were sexed. For the spatial analysis, the mean length was calculated for \n\neach 5\u00b0\u00d7 5\u00b0 square. Squares were excluded from the spatial analysis if the number \n\nof fish measured was less than five. To test the possibility of spatial segregation by \n\nsex a chi-squared test of independence was performed through a contingence \n\ntable with the counts of males and females divided into three areas (north, central \n\nand south). A chi-squared goodness-of-fit test was also performed to test the 1:1 \n\n 37 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet \n\nsex ratio hypothesis. Both statistical tests were performed at 0.05 significance \n\nlevel. \n\n \n\nT a b l e  1 .

Since 2005, the number of hooks exhibited a \n\ndeclining trend, until 2010 the last year included in the series when about only 1 \n\nmillion hooks were deployed (Figure 1). The Japanese fishing strategy was the \n\nmost common whereas the Spanish strategy was dominant in 2006 and 2007. \n\nDuring the last three years of the time series the Japanese strategy was \n\ncompletely absent. \n\n \n\n \nF i g u r e  1 .

All active flags operated in similar areas, although \n\nvessels fishing with the Spanish strategy represented a broader range and also \n\noperated more southward (Figure 2). \n\n \n\nThe area with the highest concentration of effort was located between the \n\nlatitudes of 5\u00b0N and 5\u00b0S (Figure 2). Oceanic islands, such as the archipelago of \n\nSaint Peter and Saint Paul, Fernando de Noronha Island and Rocas Atoll, as well as \n\nseveral seamounts, pertaining to the North Brazil Chain and to the Fernando de \n\nNoronha Chain, present in that area, are considered to be important fishing \n\ngrounds for tuna and tuna-like species off northeast Brazil (Hazin, 1993). \n\nImportant fishing grounds are located at a rather short distance from the ports \n\nwhere the longliners were based (Natal-RN, Recife-PE and Cabedelo-PB). Another \n\nimportant fishing area is located further south, near the seamounts and islands of \n\nthe Vitoria\u2013Trindade Chain. \n\n \n\nThe nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for the oceanic whitetip shark \n\nexhibited a gradual increase, from 0.04 sharks/1000 hooks, in 2004, the first year \n\nof the time series, up to 0.13, in 2007. In 2008, however, the CPUE increased \n\nsharply, reaching 0.43, dropping, then, back to 0.15, in 2010. The standardized \n\nindex of abundance did not differ markedly from the nominal CPUE index (Figure \n\n3). This fact could indicate that the nominal CPUE is a good proxy for the overall \n\nindex of abundance for this species or that the standardization was not efficient in \n\naccounting for the factors that affected CPUE but were not related to abundance. \n\nIt is possible that the CPUE standardization was compromised due to the low \n\nnumber of years in the data series and the lack of a homogeneous distribution of \n\nfishing effort and fishing strategy across the areas, years and quarters. \n\n \n\n 39 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet \n\n \nF i g u r e  2 .  Distribution of the effort by fishing strategy of foreign tuna longline vessels \nchartered by Brazil from 2004 to 2010. \n \n\nFor the presence\u2013absence portion of the delta-GLM, years, quarters and strategy \n\nwere the most significant factors, whereas for the positive catches portion of the \n\nmodel the order of relative importance of those variables changed to strategy, \n\nyears and quarters. The parameter estimates associated with the presence\u2013\n\nabsence and positive catch models show which variables were significant for each \n\nmodel and in which direction the factors affect the index. For the presence\u2013\n\nabsence model, all years had positive estimates in relation to 2004, meaning that \n\nthose years had a positive effect in the presence of oceanic whitetip shark. \n\nHowever, all years had negative estimates for the positive catch model, meaning \n\nthat years had a negative effect on CPUE values. In summary, it appears that the \n\nfish was more frequently encountered but at lower numbers with time. The fishing \n\nstrategy was the only factor found to be significant for both presence\u2013absence \n\nand positive catch models, with the Japanese fishing strategy showing a negative \n\neffect for both, indicating that the catches of oceanic whitetip are higher for the \n\n?60 ?50 ?40 ?30 ?20 ?10 0\n\n?5\n0\n\n?4\n0\n\n?3\n0\n\n?2\n0\n\n?1\n0\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n\nLongitude\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\nESPJAP\n\n3918\n\n?331\n?\n\n1\n\nEffort (number of hooks/1000)\n\n 40 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet \n\nSpanish fishing strategy which is characterized by the deployment of hooks at \n\nshallower depth (Tables 2 and 3).

(2007), analyzing data from the Uruguayan longline fleet, found \n\nthe highest CPUE (0.49 sharks/1000 hooks) for the species in an area close to the \n\none that showed the highest CPUE in the present study (around 20\u00b0S/35\u00b0W). \n\nExcept from an apparent trend for the oceanic whitetip shark to move away from \n\nthe Brazilian southeast coast in the fourth quarter of the year, the CPUE \n\ndistribution by quarters (Figure 5) showed no clear pattern of seasonal change. \n\n \n\nThe proportion of the oceanic whitetip shark in relation to the total catch and in \n\nrelation to the catches of elasmobranches were very low (Figure 6), 0.3% and \n\n2.7%, respectively. The oceanic whitetip shark yearly proportion of the total catch \n\ndid not exceed 0.4%, except for 2008, when it reached 1.4%.

In the \n\nremaining years this proportion ranged from 0.8% to 3.4%. These values are much \n\nlower than those observed by Lessa et al. (1999a), in an experimental survey of \n\npelagic fishes conducted between 1992 and 1997 in the southwestern equatorial \n\nAtlantic, where the whitetip catches represented almost 30% of all \n\nelasmobranchs, being the second most abundant shark, outnumbered only by the \n\nblue shark (Prionace glauca). \n\n \n\n \nF i g u r e  5 .  Quarterly distribution of CPUE (per 1000 hooks) of oceanic whitetip \nsharks caught by foreign tuna longline vessels chartered by Brazil from 2004 to \n2010. Crosses represent squares with effort and zero catch. \n \n\nThe results, however, are not comparable, due to the operational differences in \n\nthe fishing gear and methods used by the experimental and the commercial \n\noperations, the first ones having operated in much shallower layers, where the \n\nspecies is known to be much more frequently caught (Bromhead et al., 2012; \n\nNakano et al., 1997). More recent results, obtained with the use of PSAT tags \n\n 44 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet \n\n(Pop-up satellite archival tags), have confirmed that this species is largely confined \n\nto the uniform temperature surface layer (Musyl et al., 2011). Off northwest Brazil \n\nthe thermocline is as shallow as 50 m deep (Travassos et al., 1999). \n\n \n\nBesides the depth of fishing, there are several other factors that may directly \n\ninfluence the catchability of a fish species in the longline fishery, thus altering the \n\nrelationship between its catch rate (CPUE) and its actual abundance. Hazin et al. \n\n(1998), for instance, described marked fluctuations in the CPUE of several species, \n\nincluding the oceanic whitetip shark, over a period of many years, due to \n\nmodifications in fishing strategy, such as changes on target species, discovery of \n\nnew fishing grounds and introduction of new fishing technologies. Burgess et al. \n\n(2005), in turn, reported that the material of the branch line (nylon or steel), as \n\nwell as the size, type and depth of the hook can greatly influence the catchability \n\nof shark species. They also indicated that market changes might modify the target \n\nspecies of the fishery, directly interfering, therefore, in the catchability of the \n\nspecies caught. In the present case, as well, the changes of CPUE over the years \n\ncan probably be explained, at least in part, by changes in fishing strategies, \n\nespecially related to longline configuration of the different flags that were active \n\nduring the study period, as the models indicated. \n\n \n\n \nF i g u r e  6 .

The majority of males and females were \n\nbetween 100 and 180 cm TL (Figure 7), with 78% having less than 180 cm and \n\nwere probably juvenile, according to Lessa et al. (1999b).

These values were very \n\nclose to those found by other studies carried out in the same area, although in \n\nmost cases the sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1 (Lessa et al., \n\n1999a,b; Asano-Filho et al., 2004; Garc\u00eda-Cort\u00e9z and Mejuto, 2002; Coelho et al., \n\n2009).

In the present study \n\nthe hypothesis of sex and area being independent was rejected (p = 0.0409), \n\nwhich could also indicate that a geographical segregation by sex might occur in \n\nthe study area (Figure 8). The evidence for such segregation, however, is not very \n\nstrong as the hypothesis of independence was only marginally rejected. \n\n \n\n \nF i g u r e  8 .

(2009) suggested that the high percentage of small individuals in the \n\nsouthwestern equatorial Atlantic, also found in the present work, might indicate \n\nsegregation by size in the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, Lessa et al. (1999a and b) \n\nhypothesized that the large proportion of juveniles might be a result of \n\ncontinuous fishing pressure on the entire population. Nonetheless, in order to \n\nclarify this matter data from a much longer time series and a much broader \n\ngeographical coverage of the Atlantic Ocean are necessary. \n\n 47 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet \n\nThe spatial distribution of the 5\u00b0 square mean lengths (Figure 9) shows a \n\nconcentration of larger specimens from about 020\u00b0W to 035\u00b0W and from 5\u00b0S to \n\n15\u00b0S. Another area of concentration of larger specimens seems to be present to \n\nthe north of the equator and just off north of Brazil. \n\n \n\nThis study has shown the catch rates of the oceanic whitetip shark are very \n\nsensitive to changes in fishing strategy and gear, especially to those related with \n\nhook depth. It is also clear that the great majority of catches from this species in \n\nthe southwestern equatorial Atlantic are composed of juveniles.

Observer data from the \nFrench purse seine fleet combined with a historic Indian Ocean database from the \nSoviet Union were used in the analyses. In the Atlantic the time series ranged from \n1995 to 2014, while in the Indian Ocean the combined time series spanned from \n1986 to 2014. A well-marked change on the proportion of Fishing Aggregating \nDevices (FADs) with the presence of oceanic whitetip sharks in the Indian Ocean \nwas observed, fluctuating around 20% from mid 80\u2019s to mid 90\u2019s and dropping to \nless than 10% as from 2005. The changes on the OCS/FAD proportion along the \nyears show a clear link between the two distinct databases from this ocean. The \nresults indicate that the proportion of FADs with OCS could be relevant when \nderiving abundance trends for the species from multiple data sources. Occurrence \nrates were lower in the Atlantic when compared to the Indian Ocean. No marked \ntemporal trends were observed for this ocean. Results might indicate that the \noceanic whitetip population is more severely impacted in the eastern Atlantic \nOcean, since this area has been industrially exploited for longer. \n \n\n1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  \n \n\nThe oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus, is a pelagic predator widely \n\ndistributed in tropical and subtropical areas of all oceans (Compagno, 1984). It is \n\neasily distinguishable from the other species of the Carcharhinidae family by the \n\nround shape of its long pectoral and dorsal fins, as well as by the white stains in \n\ntheir margins. The species is commonly caught as bycatch by a variety of pelagic \n\nfishing gears, such as tuna longlines, gillnets, and purse seines (Bonfil et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nConcerns regarding the conservation of oceanic whitetips started to rise \n\nsubstantially in the past decade due to increasing fishing pressure throughout the \n\nspecies range, associated with an acute lack of both knowledge and adequate \n\nmonitoring of their catches (Baum et al., 2006). As a result, Tuna Regional \n\nFisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) from all oceans decided to ban \n\n 52 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\nlandings, storing, and selling of the oceanic whitetip shark (International \n\nCommission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna Rec. 10-07; Inter-American \n\nTropical Tuna Commission Rec. C-11-10; Western and Central Pacific Fisheries \n\nCommission CMM 11-04; Indian Ocean Tuna Commission Res. 13-06). The OCS \n\nhas also been recently included in CITES appendix II (March 2013, CoP16 Prop. \n\n42). \n\n \n\nAll of these measures, including the recent listing on CITES appendix II, were \n\ntaken under the precautionary approach concept and represent a first step \n\ntowards the conservation of OCS worldwide. Knowledge gaps concerning the \n\nspecies ecology and biology are still wide, imposing a barrier on the development \n\nof mitigation measures for fisheries and accurate stock assessment. \n\n \n\nThe oceanic whitetip shark is believed to have been more severely impacted by \n\npelagic longlines, as its catch rates are usually higher in fisheries using this fishing \n\ngear (Rice and Harley, 2012). As a result, the interactions of the species with \n\npelagic longlines have been more often investigated (Cort\u00e9s et al., 2010; Semba \n\nand Yokawa, 2011; Tolotti et al., 2013; Walsh et al., 2009). In the purse seine \n\nfishery, on the other hand, these interactions received much less attention. The \n\nwork presented here is a first look on how this species interacts with the purse \n\nseine fishery in the eastern Atlantic and western Indian oceans. The goal is also to \n\ninvestigate the potential of using this fishery\u2019s database to derive abundance \n\nindices and determine population trends for the oceanic whitetip shark in the \n\nglobal pelagic realm. \n\n \n\n2 .

F r e n c h  d a t a b a s e  \n\n \n\nData from 10,441 purse seine sets conducted by the French tuna fleet in the \n\neastern Atlantic and western Indian oceans were analyzed. The time series \n\n 53 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\nincludes data from the mid 90\u2019s, starting in 1995, up until 2014. In the Indian, \n\nhowever, no data was collected between the years of 1997 and 2005. Sets cover a \n\nlarge area of both oceans (Figures 1 and 2). In the Atlantic Ocean, the fishing area \n\nis roughly limited by the latitudes of 20\u00b0N and 05\u00b0S and by the African coast and \n\nthe longitude of 025\u00b0W. In the Indian Ocean, the fishing is roughly limited by the \n\nlatitudes of 05\u00b0N to 20\u00b0S and by the longitudes of 070\u00b0E to 040\u00b0E. All French data \n\ncomes from scientific observer programs, either conducted within the framework \n\nof specific European Union (EU) research projects in the 1990s and early 2000s, or \n\nsince 2005, within continuous data collection programs under the European Data \n\nCollection Regulations (Council Regulation no. 1543/2000, Commission \n\nRegulation no. 1581/2004, Council Regulation no. 199/2008, and Commission \n\nDecision 2008/949/EC). All observer programs were developed under the same \n\nmain objectives (Amand\u00e8 et al., 2012; Bourjea et al., 2014). \n\n \n\nOn-board observers were evenly distributed to cover the four quarters of the year. \n\nThey collected information regarding all fishing activities, including bycatch \n\nestimations and size frequencies by species. Each set was recorded on an exact \n\ngeographic position basis and divided into two distinct fishing strategies, sets on \n\nFree Swimming Schools (FSC) and sets on Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD). Sets \n\non both natural and man-made devices were recorded under the same FAD \n\ncategory. Whale-associated sets were treated as free-school sets and sets on \n\nwhale sharks were pooled with FAD sets. All collected information is gathered in a \n\ncommon database managed by the Observatoire Thonier, from where the data \n\npresented here was extracted. These observer programs were estimated to cover \n\n10% of the French purse seine sets in the Atlantic and around 9% in the Indian \n\nOcean (Amand\u00e8 et al., 2012; Bourjea et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n 54 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\n \nF i g u r e  1 .

On the first two years of the \n\ntime series (1995 and 96), sets on FSC were unanimity and on the following years \n\na gradual increase of sets on FAD was observed (Figure 4). Even with an increase \n\non FAD sets, the overall pattern was the predominance of FSC sets. FAD sets only \n\npredominated over FSC sets in 2005 and 2006. These years, however, up until \n\n2009, were characterized by very low sampling efforts (Figure 4). The effort was \n\nconsiderably higher in 1998, exceeding 1400 sets, and in 2014, when it reached \n\nfour digits again. The high number of fishing sets in 2014 is due to the \n\nimplementation of 100% observer coverage in this ocean. \n\n \n\nBoth fishing strategies share the same geographical area, with sets concentrating \n\nin the equatorial zone between the parallels of 05\u00b0N and 05\u00b0S (Figure 1). \n\nRegarding FSC sets, three hotspots are observed: one between the coast of \n\nGhana and the equator, one just above the equator and between the meridians of \n\n020\u00b0W and 015\u00b0W, and one just off the coast of Gabon. An important \n\n 57 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\nconcentration of FSC sets is also observed up north, just off the coast of \n\nMauritania and delimited by the latitude of 20\u00b0N. FAD sets were mostly \n\nconcentrated in the five degree square just off Gabon, especially during the 2nd \n\nand 3rd quarters of the year. The areas off Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana also \n\nconcentrated a considerable amount of FAD sets, especially on the 1st quarter. \n\n \n\nT a b l e  1 .

F r e n c h  d a t a b a s e  \u2013  I n d i a n  O c e a n  \n\n \n\nOf the 3,339 sets analyzed from the French fleet in the Indian Ocean, 32% were \n\ndone on FSC and 68% were done on FADs (Table 1). The proportion of the two \n\nfishing strategies varied considerably along the years, but, with the exception of \n\n2005 and 2007, sets on FADs were always predominant (Figure 5). The number of \n\nobserved sets also showed a great deal of variation throughout the time series \n\nand very low effort was recorded for the years 1996 and 2005 (Figure 5). These \n\nlow numbers of observed sets are due to transition periods between observer \n\nprograms in this ocean. Sampling effort was considerably high on 1995, 2009, \n\n2010 and 2014. \n\n \n\nRegarding the spatial distribution of sets, both fishing strategies shared the same \n\narea (Figure 2). Two effort hot spots are observed for sets on FADs, one inside the \n\nMozambique Channel and another one right around the Equator (from 05\u00b0 north \n\nto south) and between the meridians of 045\u00b0 and 055\u00b0 east. The sets on the \n\nMozambique Channel are seasonal, occurring mildly on the 1st quarter of the year \n\nand also on the 2nd, when it reaches its peak. There are no sets in the \n\nMozambique Channel during the 3rd and 4th quarters. Still concerning the \n\nChannel, the number of sets was remarkably high in 2009 and 2010 when \n\ncompared with the other years of the time series. Sets on FSC were more frequent \n\nin the area bonded by the 05\u00b0S and the 10\u00b0S parallels and by the 050\u00b0E and \n\n060\u00b0E meridians. \n\n \n\n3 . 1 . 3 .  U S S R  d a t a b a s e  \n\n \n\nIn the Soviet Union database the number of sets per fishing strategy was more \n\nproportionately balanced, with 259 out of 497 sets done on FADs and 238 on FSC \n\n(52% and 48%, respectively \u2013 Table 1). This proportion also varied along the years, \n\nbut remained relatively balanced for most part of the time series (Figure 5). The \n\n 59 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\nexceptions were the years 1989, when almost 100% of observed sets were on \n\nFSC, and 1991, when no FSC sets were observed. Some variation is seen on the \n\nnumber of observed sets throughout the time series, but not as pronounced as \n\nseen on the French database (Figure 5). Sampling effort below average is seen on \n\n1988 and 1992. \n\n \n\nSets of both fishing strategies were done on the same area, with FAD sets being \n\nmore widely spread (Figure 3). The latter strategy was more frequently observed \n\nalong a \u201ccorridor\u201d between 050\u00b0E and 065\u00b0E, ranging from the Equator up to \n\n05\u00b0N and down to 10\u00b0S in the squares bounded by 060\u00b0E and 065\u00b0E. Sets on FSC \n\nwere mostly concentrated in the square between the Equator and the 05\u00b0S \n\nparallel and between the 060\u00b0E and 065\u00b0E meridians. Fishing sets in the \n\nMozambique Channel were only observed during its peak season on the 2nd \n\nquarter of the year.

Most sharks were caught on FAD sets, totaling 106 OCS or 63%, \n\nwhile the remaining 37% (63 sharks) were caught on FSC sets. The number of \n\nOCS caught on FSC sets seems high, but it is important to note that sets on FSCs \n\nin this ocean were almost twice more observed then sets on FADs (65% against \n\n35%). Proportionally, the total OCS catch represented only 1% of FSC sets against \n\n4% of FAD sets (Table 1). \n\n \n\nFor every set on a free swimming school only 0.01 oceanic whitetip sharks were \n\npresent. For FAD sets the proportion of OCS occurrence was slightly higher, \n\nrepresenting 2% of these sets. Looking at each year individually a marked trend \n\nwas not evident for neither of the fishing strategies (Figure 6). However, values \n\ntended to decrease slightly over the observed years. On FAD sets the highest \n\nproportion value occurred in 1997 (5%) and the lowest value occurred in 2014 \n\n(0.2%). This declining trend was not constant either and some zero values also \n\noccurred in between. A declining trend is clearer for the OCS proportion on FSC \n\nsets (Figure 6). The highest value occurred in 1995 (6%) and the lowest occurred \n\n(0.3%). Despite the great number of observed FSC sets, the presence of OCS was \n\nrarely recorded and zero values occurred more frequently than on FAD sets. \n\n \n\nOn FAD sets, the presence of OCS was most frequently recorded in the area just \n\nabove and just below the 10\u00b0N parallel (Figure 7). Occurrence hotspots were \n\nobserved in this area in the 2nd and 4th quarters, a seasonal pattern, however, is \n\nnot clear. OCS occurrences along the equator were mainly observed during the \n\n1st quarter. Overall, catches were highly dispersed over the fishing area and 5 \n\ndegrees squares with zero occurrences were abundant during the four quarters of \n\nthe year. Occurrences on FSC sets were even more dispersed than on FAD sets \n\n 61 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\n(Figure 8). The main difference between the two strategies was the lack of OCS \n\noccurrences on FSC sets in the area around the 10\u00b0N parallel.

Even with the \n\nconsiderably high effort on the Mozambique Channel during the 2nd quarter, the \n\npresence of OCS in this area was very weak. A seasonal pattern is not evident. \n\nOverall, occurrences were more frequently recorded on the 1st and 3rd quarters. \n\nThe big 10 degrees square off Tanzania and Kenya and up to 050\u00b0E is an area \n\nwith frequent occurrences all year round, with the exception of the 4th quarter. \n\nCatches on FSC were also more frequent on the equatorial zone, although more \n\noccurrences were recorded below the 10\u00b0S parallel (Figure 11). The species was \n\nmore present on FSC sets during the 2nd and 4th quarters, but the highest \n\noccurrence level was observed on the 3rd. This \u201chotspot\u201d also needs to be looked \n\nat with caution as observed fishing effort in this square is very low, only 2 sets. \n\n \n\n3 . 2 . 2 .  I n d i a n  O c e a n  \u2013  U S S R  d a t a b a s e  \n\n \n\nFrom the historic data, 57 sets were recorded with the presence of OCS, totaling \n\n195 oceanic whitetip sharks caught on both fishing strategies (Table 1). The \n\npresence of OCS was also more frequent on FAD sets, representing 90% of the \n\ntotal number of sharks caught. Combining the years, OCS was present in 5% of \n\nFSC sets and in 17% of FAD sets. The proportion of FADs with OCS did not vary a \n\ngreat deal throughout the time series, remaining at around 20% (Figure 7). The \n\nyear of 1987 was the exception showing a value below 10%. No sharks were \n\ncaught on FADs in 1988 and 1989, which could be explained by the low sample \n\nsize of these years. The presence of OCS on FSC sets exhibited a crescent trend, \n\nvarying from 3% in 1986 to 16% in 1990 (Figure 7). Despite the reasonable \n\nsample size in 1989, no OCS catch was reported for this year. A zero catch \n\nscenario is also seen in 1992. \n\n \n\n 66 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\n \nF i g u r e  1 0 .

The species was much \n\nmore frequent on FAD sets from the second half of the year (3rd and 4th \n\nquarters). A similar spatial pattern is seen in these two quarters as their higher \n\nproportion squares occur in the same area. These squares are located along the \n\nEquator, up to 05\u00b0N, from the 050\u00b0E to the 065\u00b0E meridians.

D i s c u s s i o n  \n \n\nThe oceanic whitetip shark is believed to associate with floating objects. This \n\nstatement is supported by catch data from tuna purse seine fisheries setting on \n\nfloating objects, either natural or man-made (Clarke et al., 2013; Torres-Irineo et \n\nFAD SETS 1st 3rd \n\n2nd 4th \n\n 69 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\nal., 2014). The species is the second mostly caught shark by the tropical tuna \n\npurse seine fishery and its catch rates are considerably higher on FAD sets \n\n(Amand\u00e8 et al., 2012; Santana et al., 1998; Stretta et al., 1998). This pattern, \n\nrevealing an associative behavior around drifting objects, was observed on both \n\nFrench and USSR databases. Still, the number of OCS caught with free-swimming \n\ntuna schools was meaningful, constituting at least 10% of total OCS catch in the \n\nIndian Ocean and reaching 37% in the Atlantic. This result indicates that the \n\nassociation of oceanic whitetip sharks with free-swimming tuna schools does not \n\nseem to be a random event, as, although not often, it occurs systematically. \n\n \n\nWhen looking at the Indian Ocean database as a whole, historic and recent, a \n\nwell-marked change on the proportion of FADs with the presence of oceanic \n\nwhitetip sharks is seen on the time series chart (Figure 9). From mid 80\u2019s to mid \n\n90\u2019s this proportion fluctuated around 20% and dropped to less than 10% as from \n\n2005. There are a few odd high and lows, but, as the general pattern is quite \n\nevident, this could be a result of noise due to variations on sample size and area. \n\nTaking into account that the number of FADs has greatly increased since the 90\u2019s \n\n(Dagorn et al., 2013b; Maufroy et al., 2015), the decrease in the proportion of \n\nFADs with OCS by more than 10% could indicate an important population \n\ndecline. Following the simple line of thought that a greater number of FADs \n\nwould increase the chances of an OCS finding and associating with one, we would \n\nexpect to see an increase on the proportion of FADs with the species (assuming, \n\nof course, the population size remained stable) (Sempo et al., 2013). The data, \n\nhowever, shows that this is not the case. The populations of oceanic whitetip \n\nsharks are believed to have suffered substantial declines in the Atlantic and Pacific \n\nOceans (Baum and Blanchard, 2010; Rice and Harley, 2012). Similar studies have \n\nnot been conducted in the Indian Ocean, but the results presented here might \n\nindicate a similar scenario. Additionally, a preliminary analysis conducted on catch \n\nand effort data from the Japanese longline fishery also suggested that OCS \n\npopulation is showing signs of decline in the western Indian Ocean (Semba and \n\nYokawa, 2011). \n\n 70 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\n \nF i g u r e  1 3 .  Quarterly distribution of the proportion of oceanic whitetip sharks on FSC sets \nfrom the Soviet Union historic surveys (USSR) conducted between 1986 and 1992. The \ncrosses represent squares where sets were observed but no OCS capture was reported. \n \n\nAnother possible interpretation for the decline of OCS occurrence per FAD in the \n\nIndian Ocean could be a sharp increase on FAD densities combined with a small \n\nand stable population size. In this scenario, the proportion OCS/FAD would \n\nsimply decrease because there are not enough sharks to aggregate around that \n\nmany FADs. The analyzed data does not provide a straightforward interpretation, \n\nas both hypotheses seem plausible. However, when considering the population \n\ndeclines caused by the increased fishing pressure in other oceans and that the \n\nFSC SETS 1st 3rd \n\n2nd 4th \n\n 71 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\nfishing pressure also increased greatly in the Indian Ocean, this second scenario \n\nseems less likely. In any case, a thorough analysis taking other factors into \n\naccount, especially FAD density trends, is necessary to draw more definite \n\nconclusions. Studies on the associative behavior of oceanic whitetip sharks around \n\nfloating objects, like what has been done with silky sharks (Filmalter et al., 2015), \n\nare also crucial. \n\n \n\nThe data shown on Figure 9 comes from two distinct databases (USSR and \n\nFrench), yet the changes on the OCS/FAD proportion along the years show a clear \n\nlink between them. Proportions derived from the early years of the French \n\ndatabase are at the same magnitude order of the proportions derived from the \n\nhistoric database (USSR). This indicates that this index (proportion of FADs with \n\nOCS) could be relevant when deriving trends from multiple data sources. The \n\nproportion of sets on FSC with the presence of oceanic whitetip seems to have \n\ndecreased between historic and recent data, however this change was minor and \n\na well-defined trend is not evident. As discussed above, the capture of OCS on \n\nfree swimming schools in not negligible, but still is very sparse. Being an index \n\nderived from a less frequent event, the proportion of OCS on FSC sets is more \n\nsubject to noise than the proportion on FAD sets, making it more difficult to pick \n\nup trends and requiring a much bigger sample size. This issue becomes more \n\nevident when looking at the spatial distributions of the occurrence of OCS/FSC \n\nsets on Figures 11 and 13. Surely that when deriving population estimates from \n\ncatch and effort data all sources of catch must be taken into account. However, \n\nwhen it comes to deriving indices and examining trends the focus should be on \n\nFAD sets. \n\n \n\nSeasonal patterns could not be distinguished when looking at the distributions of \n\noceanic whitetip occurrences per set. The data, however, indicates that there is a \n\nspatial component to be considered in the Indian Ocean. The Mozambique \n\nChannel was heavily sampled on the French database, but both total catch and \n\noccurrence rate were very low in this area (Figures 10 and 11). The extremely low \n\n 72 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\nvalues of FADs with OCS seen in Figure 9 seem to be influenced by this spatial \n\ncomponent. In the years in question, 2009 and 2010, the number of sets inside \n\nthe Channel was around 6 times higher than the other years. Since the species is \n\nless observed in purse seiners catches in this area, these high effort values pulled \n\nthe OCS/FAD proportion down. This is an interesting result to be investigated \n\nfurther, specially considering that the Mozambique Channel is an area with great \n\ndensity of floating objects (Dagorn et al., 2013a). \n\n \n\nOceanic whitetip sharks were less frequently caught in the Atlantic than in the \n\nIndian Ocean (Table 1). Only 2% of the FAD sets in this ocean had the presence of \n\nan OCS, as opposed to 6% for the same period in the Indian Ocean. This low \n\nproportion ranged from the beginning to the end of the time series and, although \n\na slight decrease seems to have occurred, no marked trend was observed. The \n\nlow rate of occurrence and the lack of a marked trend hamper a discussion \n\nconcerning the time evolution of the abundance of the species in the eastern \n\nAtlantic and leaves unanswered questions. Has the OSC population in the western \n\nIndian Ocean always been bigger or are the lower proportion values in the \n\nAtlantic a result of a high fishing pressure over a longer period? Large-scale \n\nlongline vessels started exploring the Atlantic in the late 1950\u2019s and purse seine \n\nvessels have been fishing for tuna off topical West Africa since the 1960\u2019s, while in \n\nthe Indian Ocean large-scale fisheries developed slower, only reaching big \n\nproportions in the 1980\u2019s (Miyake et al., 2004). The eastern Atlantic has been \n\nunder big fishing pressure for longer, thus the OCS population might have been \n\nbigger before the 90\u2019s and at comparable levels with the western Indian Ocean. \n\nThe analysis of historic data is crucial to elucidate this matter. Another question \n\nthat can be asked is if the associative behavior of OCS is the same between the \n\ntwo oceans. Maybe, the proportion of OCS on FAD sets in the Atlantic are lower \n\nsimply because they associate less on floating objects than in the Indian Ocean. \n\nThis highlights the importance of understanding the species behavior around \n\nFADs. \n\n \n\n 73 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery \n\nUsing longline data to derive bycatch population trends is typically problematic, \n\nas small variations on gear type and fishing strategy can greatly impact the \n\ncatchability of a species and interfere on the relationship between its catch rate \n\nand its actual abundance (Ward, 2008). Abundance trends for the oceanic \n\nwhitetip have been heavily questioned due to standardization problems (Baum et \n\nal., 2003; Burgess et al., 2005) and question marks still remain regarding the \n\nspecies population status. The proportion of FADs with the presence of oceanic \n\nwhitetip sharks could potentially provide a simple abundance trend index, with \n\nthe advantage of a probably lower catchability bias when compared to pelagic \n\nlongline catches. To further investigate population size trends for the endangered \n\nOCS derived from the purse seine fishery, however, key information on the \n\nevolution of FAD densities is required. Knowledge on the associative behavior of \n\nthis species, in particular the time they spend at floating objects and the time \n\nbetween two associations, is also essential. \n\n \n\n5 .

The \nBrazilian tuna longline fleet, operating in the equatorial and southwestern \nAtlantic, is used as a case study. Fisheries dependent data include information \nfrom logbooks (from 1999 to 2011) and on-board observers (2004 to 2010), \ntotaling 65,277 pelagic longline sets. Fisheries independent data were obtained \nfrom 8 oceanic whitetip sharks tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags in the \narea where longline fleet operated. Deployment periods varied from 60 to 178 \ndays between 2010 and 2012. Tagging and pop-up sites were relatively close to \neach other, although individuals tended to travel long distances before returning \nto the tagging area. Some degree of site fidelity was observed. High utilization \nhotspots of tagged sharks fell inside the area under strongest fishing pressure. \nDespite the small sample size, a positive correlation between tag recorded \ninformation and catch data was detected. All sharks exhibited a strong preference \nfor the warm and shallow waters of the mixed layer, spending on average more \nthan 70% of the time above the thermocline and 95% above 120 m. Results \nindicate that the removal of shallow hooks on longline gear might be an efficient \nmitigation measure to reduce the bycatch of this pelagic shark species. The work \nalso highlights the potential of tagging experiments to provide essential \ninformation for the development of spatio-temporal management measures. \n \n\n1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  \n \n\nThe oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus, OCS) is a tropical predator \n\n[1,2] commonly taken as bycatch in pelagic fisheries using longlines, gillnets, and \n\npurse seines [3]. Inadequate monitoring hampers the assessment of stock status \n\nfor this species, but there is a broad consensus that populations are decreasing \n\n[4,5]. Concerns regarding the conservation of oceanic whitetips have risen \n\nsubstantially during the past decade due to increasing fishing pressure \n\nthroughout the species range and inadequate catch monitoring, associated with \n\nan acute lack \t of knowledge on the behavior and ecology of the species. In \nresponse to an evident, and in some cases drastic, decline of abundance trends, \n\nTuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), responsible for the \n\nmanagement of tuna fisheries and associated species, adopted a series of strong \n\n 78 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n\nmeasures to bolster conservation efforts for the oceanic whitetip shark \n\n(International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna Rec. 10\u201307; Inter- \n\nAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission Rec. C-11-10; Western and Central Pacific \n\nFisheries CommissionCMM11\u201304; Indian Ocean Tuna Commission Res. 13\u201306). \n\nThese measures essentially banned the take of oceanic whitetip sharks by \n\nprohibiting the retention, landing or storing of the whole carcass or any part \n\nthereof. The oceanic whitetip is the only pelagic shark species covered by such \n\nmeasures across all oceans. The species was also recently included in CITES \n\nappendix II (March 2013, CoP16 Prop. 42). \n\n \n\nUnder current fishing practices, however, the incidental capture of this species is \n\ndifficult to be avoided. Furthermore, many individuals are dead or dying by the \n\ntime the fishing gear is retrieved. As such, the measures currently in place do little \n\nto alleviate fishing mortality, which continues to impact oceanic whitetip \n\npopulations across all oceans. The development of mitigation measures capable \n\nof not only reducing their catch rates but also increasing their post-release survival \n\nare therefore crucial for improving population levels [6]. In ecological terms, the \n\nvulnerability of a species depends upon two factors: the sensitivity of the species \n\nto an external factor and how extensive the exposure to this hazard is [7,8]. Shark \n\nspecies are known to have low rebound capacities resulting directly from their life \n\nhistory traits of slow growth, late maturation and low fecundity. These biological \n\ncharacteristics make this group much more sensitive to overexploitation than \n\nteleost fishes [9\u201311]. \n\n \n\nThe present study assesses the vulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark by \n\nanalyzing the extent of its fishing exposure (accessibility) to pelagic longline \n\nfisheries. The Brazilian tuna longline fleet, operating in the equatorial and \n\nsouthwestern Atlantic, is used as a case study. The overall goal is to provide \n\ninformation needed to aid in the design of management measures and improve \n\nconservation efforts for this species. Both fisheries dependent (fisheries logbooks, \n\nobservers) and independent (electronic tags) datasets were used as \n\n 79 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n\ncomplementary sources of information. This integrating approach provided a \n\nbetter understanding of the interactions between oceanic sharks and this fishery. \n\nVulnerability was assessed with regard to both spatial dynamics (horizontal) and \n\ndepth distribution (vertical) of both sharks and longline gear, taking into \n\nconsideration seasonality and strategies in the fishery.  \n\n \n\n2 .  M a t e r i a l  a n d  m e t h o d s  \n\n2 . 1 .  T a g g i n g  \n\n \n\nA total of 11 oceanic whitetip sharks were tagged with pop-up satellite archival \n\ntags (PAT), manufactured by Wildlife Computers (Redmond, USA), in the South \n\nAtlantic Ocean. From these, 7 reported data to the satellites as scheduled, 1 \n\nreported prematurely and 3 never reported (Table 1). Two models of PAT were \n\nused: 7 MK10s and 4 miniPATs, with all of the non-reporting tags being Mk10s. \n\nBoth models were set to collect data on depth, water temperature and ambient \n\nlight level (for estimation of geolocation) every 10 seconds. The Mk10, however, \n\nonly transmitted a summary of that data in the form of depth and temperature \n\nhistograms, while the MiniPATs transmitted time series data at a resolution of 5 \n\nminutes. \n\n \n\nThe first two Mk10 tags (AOCS1 and AOCS2) were programmed to summarize \n\nthe collected data into one-hour histograms while all others were set to generate \n\nsix-hour histograms. One MK10 was recovered (AOCS3) allowing the complete \n\ntime series, with 10-second resolution, to be accessed. The miniPATs were \n\nprogrammed to transmit only depth time series data and not temperature. \n\n 80 \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners\t\n\t\n\n \n\nT a b l e  1 .

Day was defined as the period between sunrise and sunset, and \n\nnight as the period between astronomical dusk and astronomical dawn. Dusk \n\ncomprised the hours between sunset and astronomical dusk, while dawn \n\ncomprised the hours between astronomical dawn and sunrise. To compare \n\ndaytime and nighttime depth \t distributions, Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test was \nperformed at 95% confidence level. Crepuscular periods (dawn and dusk) were \n\nomitted from this analysis.  \n\n \n\n 82 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n \n\n\t\n\n2 . 3 .  H o r i z o n t a l  m o v e m e n t s   \n\n \n\nThe horizontal movements of tagged sharks were estimated by processing the \n\ndata received from the Argos satellite system using the manufacturer light-based \n\ngeolocation software (WC-GPE: Global Position Estimator Program suite, available \n\nat: www.wildlifecomputers. com). Longitude is estimated from the time of local \n\nnoon and latitude from the length of the day through the dawn and dusk \n\nsymmetry method. In order to minimize the errors usually associated to this \n\ngeolocation estimation [12,13], the tracks were post-processed using the IKNOS \n\nWalk model [14]. In this approach, tracks are corrected and interpolated at fixed \n\nintervals by bootstrapping random walk particles. The locations are estimated \n\nfrom a cloud of weighted particles and corrections can be applied based on \n\nknown constraints or available data. \n\n \n\nIn the present study, the tracks were interpolated to obtain one position a day and \n\nwere prevented from crossing land. A maximum speed threshold was also \n\nimplemented into the model. Starting from 3 km/h, several speeds were tested up \n\nto 10 km/h (by 1 km/h increments). The maximum speed of 9 km/h was selected \n\nbased on the end point criteria, meaning this maximum speed was the slowest \n\nspeed that allowed all tracks to end at the known pop-up point. The error around \n\nestimated positions is displayed by 50 alternative positions for each point, \n\nrepresenting minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes. \n\n \n\nTo estimate the areas of high utilization, a Two-Dimensional Kernel Density \n\nEstimation was applied to the cloud of alternative points (error). Data from all \n\nindividuals were combined in this analysis, conducted using the MASS package \n\n[15] in the R environment [16]. The bandwidth was chosen via Normal Reference \n\nDistribution. In order to expose areas of high utilization, density values smaller \n\nthan 0.01 were excluded from the plot. \n\n \n\n 83 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n \n\n\t\n\n2 . 4 .  F i s h e r i e s  d a t a  \n\n \n\nFishing effort data from the Brazilian tuna longline fleet between 1999 and 2011, \n\ntotaling 65,277 sets, were used to assess the vulnerability of oceanic whitetip \n\nsharks to this fishery. The Brazilian fleet operates in a wide area of the equatorial \n\nand southwestern Atlantic Ocean and uses two distinct fishing strategies \n\ncommonly referred to as \u201cJapanese\u201d (JAP) and \u201cSpanish\u201d (SPA). In general, \n\nvessels fishing with the Spanish strategy target swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and set \n\nsurface longlines (down to 100 m) at night, using light sticks and squid as bait. \n\nAlternatively, vessels fishing with the Japanese strategy target various tuna \n\nspecies and set deep longlines (down to more than 200 m) early in the morning, \n\nusing small pelagic fish as bait (mainly mackerel) [17]. Fishing effort was \n\nrepresented by the number of hooks deployed, grouped into 5\u00b0 squares for \n\nspatial analyses. \n\n \n\nNominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) data were analyzed to account for possible \n\nseasonal variations. A subsample of the dataset previously analyzed by Tolotti et \n\nal. [17] was considered for this purpose. This dataset was collected by the \n\nBrazilian Observer Program from foreign-chartered tuna longline vessels between \n\n2004 and 2010. Spatial bounds for this data were selected based on the shark \n\nhigh utilization areas (from tag data), as well as on the area where the fishing \n\neffort was concentrated. The CPUE represented the number of OCS/1,000 hooks \n\nper quarter. Mean values were calculated using the sum of all catch and all effort \n\nin each quarter. Data were also grouped according to the fishing strategy. Two-\n\nsample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used for inter-quarter comparisons at a \n\n95% confidence level.  \n\n \n\nTo evaluate the spatial overlap between fisheries and tagging data precisely, it \n\nwould be necessary to use a CPUE index that accounts for the depth distribution \n\nof the hooks. In the absence of such data, an occurrence index was adopted. For \n\nthis analysis, data were also grouped into 5\u00b0 squares and by quarter. For each \n\n 84 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n \n\n\t\n\nsquare, the number of sets with the presence of OCS were summed and then \n\ndivided by the total number of observed sets. The occurrence values were then \n\npaired with the Kernel densities (also grouped by quarters and 5\u00b0\u00d75\u00b0 squares). \n\nFor each square, density values were summed. A Spearman's Rank test was \n\nconducted to verify possible correlation between fisheries and tagging data \n\n(occurrence and Kernel density). The non-parametric Spearman's Rank was \n\nchosen after verifying that the two datasets did not conform to a bivariate normal \n\ndistribution (Royston's Multivariate Normality Test, p = 9.217239e-06).  \n\n \n\nT a b l e  2 .

For both fishing strategies, SPA and JAP, \n\nmost hooks were deployed within this area of concentrated effort. In contrast, the \n\nproportion of hooks deployed by fishing strategy varied considerably over time \n\n(Figure 5).

V e r t i c a l  v u l n e r a b i l i t y  \n\n \n\nThe vertical movements observed in the present study are in agreement with the \n\nexisting literature, which describes the oceanic whitetip shark as an epipelagic \n\npredator of warm tropical waters [2] and places the species in the group of \n\npelagic fishes that spend the majority of their time in the upper uniform-\n\ntemperature surface layer, rarely descending to waters below 20\u00b0C [18]. Through \n\nthe use of electronic tags, two recent studies have also provided evidence to \n\nconfirm these general statements. Musyl et al. [19], working near Hawaii, found \n\nthat OCS were largely confined to the mixed layer (~120 m), spending>95% of \n\ntheir time at temperatures within 2\u00b0C of the sea surface temperature (SST). OCS \n\nfrom the North Atlantic (Bahamas) exhibited a similar vertical pattern, essentially \n\noccupying the upper 125 m of the epipelagic zone at temperatures close to the \n\nSST [20].  \n\n \n\nThe oceanic whitetip shark\u2019s strong preference for shallow and warm waters is \n\nalso reflected on the depths of the longline hooks where the species is most \n\ncommonly caught. Nakano et al. [21], for instance, concluded that the catch rates \n\nof OCS increased significantly with the decrease of hook depth. In a more specific \n\nstudy, data from the Brazilian longline fleet showed that the CPUE for OCS tended \n\nto be lower for the vessels targeting tuna, which operate with deeper longlines \n\n(down to 200 m), than those targeting swordfish, which operate with shallower \n\ngear (>100 m) [17]. A sample of this data set, shown in Figure 7, further highlights \n\nthe greater impact of the shallow Spanish fishing strategy on OCS CPUE values. \n\nThis result comes with little surprise given that the depth range of the gear used in \n\nthis fishing strategy corresponds exactly to the species vertical distribution. \n\n \n\nThis vertical overlap is particularly concerning when the majority of the Brazilian \n\nfleet operates with shallow longlines exactly in the area where the species can be \n\n 96 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n \n\n\t\n\nmost readily found. Although the proportion between the two fishing strategies \n\n(JAP-deep and SPA-shallow) in the Brazilian fleet varies considerably over the \n\nyears, these fluctuations are mainly due to temporary fishing agreements between \n\nthe Brazilian government and foreign companies [22]. The permanent Brazilian \n\nfleet, however, typically operates with shallow gear, primarily around the equator \n\nand close to seamounts [23], which means the vertical preferred habitat of the \n\noceanic whitetip shark is extensively exploited. \n\n \n\nThe results from the present study, combined with other recently published works, \n\nshow that the vertical distribution of the oceanic whitetip shark is well defined. \n\nDespite the clear need for further data to fill the extensive knowledge gaps on the \n\necology of the species, this information is already of great importance for defining \n\nmitigation measures. A ban on retaining, landing, storing or selling this species \n\nhas been established by all tuna RFMOs. This measure, however, does not \n\npreclude fishers from catching oceanic whitetip sharks. Practical mitigation \n\nmethods, such as eliminating shallow hooks (above 100 m) on longlines, require \n\nparticular attention. The removal of shallower hooks has already shown promising \n\nresults in reducing catch rates of several epipelagic bycatch species [24]. It is \n\nimportant to bear in mind, however, that mitigation measures can generate \n\nimpacts on other species and so both their positive and negative impacts must be \n\ncarefully evaluated [25]. \n\n \n\n4 . 2 .  H o r i z o n t a l  v u l n e r a b i l i t y  \n\n \n\nOceanic whitetip sharks tagged in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean appear to \n\nhave a certain degree of site fidelity to the area off northeast Brazil around the \n\nequator, where all of their \ttracks started. Five out of eight sharks have ended their \ntracks relatively close to their starting points, even after traveling several thousand \n\nkilometers. Three of these sharks also remained within 500 km of the tagging \n\nlocations during most of the tracking period. Although time limitations prevent \n\ndefinitive conclusions from being drawn, a recent study conducted in the \n\n 97 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n \n\n\t\n\nBahamas (northwestern Atlantic) also reported that OCS returned to the tagging \n\narea after long migrations [20]. The Bahamian study gathered data from 10 OCS \n\nwith deployment periods up to 245 days. In the year following their study, scuba \n\ndivers also spotted one of the tagged sharks near the tagging location [20]. The \n\nauthors considered this returning behavior to fall under the definition of \n\nphilopatry, which is the tendency of an organism to return or remain near a \n\nparticular site [26]. The findings presented here further support this theory. \n\n \n\nAnother interesting observation is that oceanic whitetips from both studies \n\n(Northwestern and Southwestern Atlantic) did not mix. More data is certainly \n\nrequired before a conclusion can be reached, but this result could be an \n\nindication that northern and southern populations might well be separated. The \n\nrecently developed \u201celectronic spaghetti tag\u201d could be a useful and cost-effective \n\ntool to investigate this matter. This new satellite tag does not record any data, but \n\nsimply reports where it pops off, providing fisheries-independent measures of \n\ndispersal patterns and migration [27]. Fine scale genetic studies using \n\nmicrosatellite loci could also shed light on this matter [28]. If these hypotheses \n\nhold, well-defined populations and philopatric behavior can have substantial \n\nimplications for the conservation of this species and suggest that the oceanic \n\nwhitetip shark could benefit, not only from global management measures, but \n\nfrom local measures as well.  \n\n \n\nThe distribution of the effort from the Brazilian longline fleet raises important \n\nconcerns regarding the species\u2019 vulnerability to fisheries, especially given its \n\ndepleted population status [29\u201331]. The Kernel Density estimates indicate that the \n\nhigh utilization areas fall exactly within the area where the fishing pressure is \n\nconsiderably higher. The region off northeast Brazil, where OCS seems to have \n\nsome degree of philopatry, is rich in oceanic features such as islands, banks and \n\nseamounts, mostly belonging to the North Brazil and Fernando de Noronha \n\nChains, located between 2\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 South and 32\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 West [32]. The areas \n\n 98 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n \n\n\t\n\nsurrounding these features are considered important fishing grounds for tuna and \n\ntuna-like species, including sharks [23,33]. \n\n \n\nInterestingly, when looking at the study area at a finer scale the kernel hot spot for \n\nthe second quarter appears to be slightly outside of the highest fishing pressure \n\narea (Figure 8B). In this quarter, the high-utilization hot spot of oceanic whitetip \n\nsharks is located just off northeast Brazil above the Cabo Calcanhar and below the \n\nequator, while most of the fishing sets at this time of the year were made just \n\nabove the equator. This lack of overlap between the species high-utilization area \n\nand fisheries highest effort could explain the significantly lower CPUE during the \n\nsecond quarter as seen in Figure 6. A much stronger overlap is seen on the first \n\nquarter, which had a higher average CPUE. Considering the time limitation of the \n\nstudy (tagging data concentrated on the first semester) and the few individuals \n\ntagged, it is interesting to find a spatial correlation between fisheries and tagging \n\ndata. The philopatric behavior combined with the fact that tagging was conducted \n\nthrough commercial fishing vessels, might have contributed for this result. \n\nTagging oceanic whitetip sharks outside of the major fishing zone would provide \n\nessential information for validating these findings. In any case, the correlation \n\nfound here highlights the potential that tagging experiments hold for providing \n\nknowledge for the design of spatio-temporal management measures. \n\n \n\nMore data are clearly needed to understand the spatial dynamics of oceanic \n\nwhitetip sharks in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic and more tagging \n\nexperiments should be encouraged. Future studies should focus on covering the \n\nentire year cycle through both long deployment periods and tagging during \n\ndifferent seasons. Improved fisheries monitoring is also of extreme importance \n\nand observer programs therefore require expansion. This study also highlights \n\nhow fisheries dependent and independent data sources can complement one \n\nanother.  \n\n \n\n 99 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners \n \n\n\t\n\n5 .

The aim was to improve our \nknowledge on the vertical behavior of this specie. Sharks were tagged in the \nAtlantic (5) and Indian oceans (1) between 2011 and 2012. Deployment periods \nvaried from 100 to 178 days. The sharks spent most of their time in the mixed \nlayer, confirming the status of epipelagic species. However, the analyses revealed \ncomplex vertical movement patterns, including marked diel changes and \nbehavior modes. Generalized Additive Models indicated that vertical movements \nwere strongly correlated with variations of the depth of the mixed layer. A \ncorrelation between vertical movements and sea surface temperature (SST) was \nalso observed. When SST was above average oceanic whitetips increased their \nvertical activity disregarding the shrink of the mixed layer. This pattern suggests \nthat thermoregulation might occur for the species. \n \n\n1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  \n \n\nThe oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is a threatened pelagic \n\npredator from tropical waters ocean wide (Bonfil et al., 2008). The species is a \n\ncommon bycatch of open water fisheries targeting tuna (Thunnus spp.), swordfish \n\n(Xiphias gladius) and other tuna-like species (Beerkircher et al., 2000; Fr\u00e9dou et \n\nal., 2015; Gallagher et al., 2014; Hall and Roman, 2013; Oliver et al., 2015). The \n\noceanic whitetip acquired its threatened status due to the increasing fishing \n\npressure throughout its range and due to a lack of knowledge regarding its \n\nbiology and ecology (Baum et al., 2006). Under the precautionary approach, a \n\nseries of management measures, which banned the landing, storing and selling of \n\noceanic whitetip sharks, were recently implemented by all Tuna RFMOs (Tolotti et \n\nal., 2015a). The species is now the only pelagic shark protected in all three \n\noceans. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild \n\nFauna and Flora (CITES) has also included the oceanic whitetip in appendix II, \n\nmeaning its trade must now be closely controlled (CoP16 Prop. 42). \n\n \n\n 105 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n\nThe lack of knowledge regarding the biology and ecology of the oceanic whitetip \n\nshark partly comes from its bycatch nature, which has historically resulted in fewer \n\nincentives for research and conservation (Barker and Schluessel, 2005). In light of \n\nthe ocean wide declining scenario of the species\u2019 populations and of an increased \n\ninterest for conservation of bycatch species, the scientific community has directed \n\nsignificant research efforts to fill these wide knowledge gaps. The recent research \n\nincluded reproductive biology (Tambourgi et al., 2013), feeding (Madigan et al., \n\n2015), fisheries (Rice and Harley, 2012; Tolotti et al., 2013), movement patterns \n\nand behavior (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; Musyl et al., 2011; Tolotti et al., 2015a). \n\nThe latters used satellite archival tags to reveal valuable information concerning \n\ntheir horizontal movements, depth preferences and temperature ranges. Most of \n\nthe published information, however, consisted on general summaries and vertical \n\nmovements were not explored in detail.  \n\n \n\nThe aim of this study is to provide information on the vertical movement patterns \n\nof the oceanic whitetip shark, in order to go beyond the existing knowledge that \n\nthis is an epipelagic species. Do oceanic whitetip sharks exhibit diel vertical \n\npatterns? Do they display different vertical behavioral modes? Is their vertical \n\nbehavior driven by the environment? Are they strictly restricted to the mixed \n\nlayer? Improving our knowledge on bycatch species is an essential step towards \n\nan ecosystem-based fisheries management, which focus on the ecosystem as a \n\nwhole rather then on maximizing individual target species (Garcia and Cochrane, \n\n2005; Pikitch et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n2 .  M a t e r i a l  a n d  m e t h o d s  \n \n\nTime series of depth records from six oceanic whitetip sharks were analyzed in \n\ndetail. All time series came from pop-up satellite archival tags (PAT) deployed in \n\nthe Atlantic (5) and Indian (1) oceans on 2011 and 2012 (Table 1). Deployment \n\nperiods varied from 100 to 178 days. Summarized results of the 5 tags deployed \n\n 106 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n\nin the Atlantic were previously described in Tolotti et al. (2015), as well as the \n\ntagging protocol. The Atlantic sharks were tagged close to the equator on the \n\nwestern side of this ocean. All individuals made extensive movements, but \n\nremained mostly in the equatorial zone. Only one shark migrated south (Figure 1). \n\nThe shark tagged in the Indian Ocean was caught with hand line during a research \n\ncruise on the Mozambique Channel. For the tagging procedure, this shark was \n\nbrought on board and placed in a tagging cradle. The tag was attached \n\nintramuscularly under the first dorsal fin using a stainless steel tether and large \n\nWilton anchors. This individual was tagged inside the Mozambique Channel and \n\nmigrated north, following the African coast until Somali (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n \nF i g u r e  1 .

D a t a  d e s c r i p t i o n  \n\n \n\nPop-up satellite archival tags typically store depth (ambient pressure), water \n\ntemperature and light level readings at 10 seconds intervals. This information is \n\nthen used to produce different data products that are transmitted via satellite after \n\nthe tag detaches from the animal. Transmitted data will depend on tag model and \n\nuser-defined settings. Two models of PAT tags, manufactured by Wildlife \n\nComputers (Redmond, USA), were used in this study, 5 miniPATs and 1 MK10. \n\nThe miniPATs were programmed to transmit depth time series with a resolution of \n\n5 minutes. The MK10 do not transmit time series, only an aggregated summary of \n\nthe recorded data, however this tag was physically recovered from Crystal Beach \n\n(Texas) after drifting at sea for about one year since its pop-up. This allowed the \n\ndownload of the complete depth and temperature time series with 10 seconds \n\nresolution. Although MiniPATs were not programmed to transmit temperature \n\ntime series, other transmitted data products provided information on the \n\nsurrounding environment. These products include a daily analysis of the surface \n\nmixed layer and sea surface temperature (SST), as well as a summary of \n\ntemperature at depth profiles (PDTs). These data products were also available \n\nfrom the recovered MK10. \n\n \n\n2 . 2 .  D a t a  a n a l y s i s  \n\n2 . 2 . 1 .  V e r t i c a l  m o v e m e n t  p a t t e r n s  \n\n \n\nThe periods of the day were classified according to local times of sunrise and \n\nsunset, following the procedure described in Tolotti et al. (2015) and according to \n\nthe NOAA estimation (http://www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/sunrise.html). \n\nSince sharks performed extensive horizontal movements during their monitoring \n\nperiods, local sunrise and sunset times varied within and between individuals. \n\nThese variations, however, were not superior to 50 minutes difference. To \n\nfacilitate graphic representations where data is aggregated, day, night dawn and \n\n 109 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n\n\t\n\ndusk were marked by their respective minimum and maximum estimated times. \n\nDaytime and nighttime depths were compared through the non-parametric \n\nWilcoxon Test at 95% confidence level. For this analysis, depths corresponding to \n\ncrepuscular hours were excluded. Depth data was also grouped into one-hour \n\nintervals of mean values to test for uniformity over the 24h cycle. The uniformity \n\nwas tested using circular statistics (Rao\u2019s Spacing Test), also at 95% confidence \n\nlevel. \n\n \n\nA spectral analysis was carried out with the time series of the recovered tag \n\n(AOCS3), since it does not have any transmission gaps. The aim was to look for \n\nperiodicity in the vertical behavior and infer on possible temporal patterns. A fast \n\nFourier transformation (FFT) algorithm was used through the build-in Stats \n\npackage in R (R Core Team, 2013). The function calculates a smoothed \n\nperiodogram using Daniell windows, which are modified moving average filters. \n\nThe raw periodogram is a wildly fluctuating estimate of the spectrum with high \n\nvariance and this smoothing methodology provides a stable estimate (Bloomfield, \n\n2004). The spectral analysis is particularly well suited for long-term and high-\n\nresolution time series, including those from archival tagging studies (Shepard et \n\nal., 2006). \n\n \n\nThe time series were also visually assessed in order to examine any possible \n\nvertical patterns that could have been masked when grouping the data. They \n\nwere conducted with the help of a visualization tool that enabled zooming and \n\nscrolling of the time series. The visualization window was adjusted to fit two days \n\nat a time. In this analysis, the times of sunrise and sunset did no need to be \n\nestimated. Instead, the depth readings were paired with the light readings \n\ntransmitted by the tags. The light data is transmitted in the form of two daily light \n\ncurves, representing sunrise and sunset. For the recovered tag the complete time \n\nseries of light readings is available. The paring between light curves and depth \n\nreadings was possible thanks to IGOR Pro, a graphing and analysis software \n\ndeveloped by WaveMetrics, Inc. The tag\u2019s manufacturer data portal (WC-DAP: \n\n 110 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n\n\t\n\nWildlife Data Analysis Program) exports a file that is formatted for use with IGOR \n\nPro, which facilitated the visual assessment analysis. This paring also increased the \n\nprecision when looking for diel patterns. \n\n \n\n2 . 2 . 2 .  V e r t i c a l  m o v e m e n t s  a n d  t h e  e n v i r o n m e n t  \n\n \n\nTo reconstruct the vertical environment occupied by the oceanic whitetip sharks \n\nduring their monitoring periods the temperature at depth summary data (PDT) \n\nwas used. This data product provides the minimum and maximum temperatures \n\nat fixed 8m depth intervals every 24h. The average temperatures of each depth \n\ninterval were linearly interpolated to produce continuous daily temperature \n\nprofiles with a 0.5m grid resolution, following the method described in Bauer et \n\nal. (2015). The interpolated temperature profiles were then plotted using a heat-\n\ncolor scheme. This method was chosen since it was proved to be a good \n\nalternative in the absence of temperature time series (Bauer et al., 2015). \n\n \n\nGeneralized Additive Models (GAMs) have been used to model habitat \n\npreferences on a variety of oceanic species, including sharks (Bustamante and \n\nBennett, 2013; Damalas and Megalofonou, 2010; Lam et al., 2014; Zagaglia et al., \n\n2004). In this study, a GAM was applied to model the vertical movement of \n\noceanic whitetip sharks based on the environmental data transmitted by the tags. \n\nThe daily standard deviation (SD) was considered to be a proxy of sharks\u2019 vertical \n\nvariability (movement amplitude) and, therefore, chosen as response variable. The \n\nexplanatory variables included geolocation estimates (longitude/latitude), sea \n\nsurface temperature (SST), mixed layer depth (MLD) and shark size were \n\nintroduced as smoothing terms (thin plate regression splines). To assess temporal \n\neffects, \u201cmonth\u201d was included as factorial variable. Since sharks were tagged in \n\ntwo ocean basins (Atlantic and Indian), \u201cocean\u201d was also included as factorial \n\nvariable. Modeling was conducted using the gam function of the mgcv R-package \n\n(Wood, 2006), using the Gaussian family. All possible combinations between \n\nvariables and factors were tested, totaling 63 models. Models were also run \n\n 111 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n\n\t\n\nseparately for each individual shark in order to investigate individual variability. In \n\nthis case, \u201cocean\u201d and \u201csize\u201d were not considered, resulting on 15 possible \n\ncombinations. Model selection was based on the Akaike\u2019s information criterion \n\n(AIC) and further evaluated with residual analysis. \n\n \n\n3 .  R e s u l t s  \n\n3 . 1 .

However, different patterns were also observed within and between \n\nindividuals. The strongest signal was observed during crepuscular hours, \n\nespecially at dawn, when sharks swam at considerably shallower depths (Figure 2) \n\nand spent more time in the firsts 10 m. Circular statistics, applied to the average \n\ndepth per hour of each individual, revealed a lack of uniformity over a 24h cycle \n\nfor all oceanic whitetip sharks (Rao\u2019s Spacing Test p>0.001). The tests result \n\nhighlights the consistency of this crepuscular pattern, present even when day and \n\nnight differences are not observed. \n\n \n\nRegarding day and night differences, Figure 2 also shows a general pattern of \n\nshallower average depths during daytime as opposed to nighttime, when tagged \n\nsharks appear to move to deeper waters. This pattern is well marked for sharks \n\nAOCS4, 5, 7 and IOCS1, which exhibited statistically significant differences \n\nbetween occupied depths of light and dark hours (Table 2). For sharks AOCS3 \n\nand 6, the average depths did not evidence differences between day and night \n\nand statistical differences were not detected either. Another interesting feature \n\ndraws attention on Figure 2. Daytime average depths form a slight U-shape, with \n\nthe tagged sharks being in relative shallow waters at sunrise, gradually moving \n\ndeeper as midday approaches and, finally, returning to shallow waters at dusk. \n\n 112 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n\n\t\n\nThe U-shape can be observed even when day and night average depths do not \n\ndiffer, as is the case of shark AOCS3. \n\n \n\n \nF i g u r e  2 .

The 24h peak indicates that periodical behavioral shifts regarding \n\ndaytime and nighttime depths are also occurring. The broad base of this peak, \n\nhowever, implies that there is a high degree of variability as to when these shifts \n\noccur.

Shark AOCS3, for instance, \n\nexhibited the three types of behavior almost in the same proportion (Figure 5) \n\nand these behaviors were highly intercalated across its time series. Long \n\nsequences of the same behavior type were rare for this individual, the maximum \n\nbeing nine consecutive days of type I (Figure 6). In fact, long sequences of one \n\nbehavior type were only seen when this particular behavior was already \n\npredominant for the individual, like type I for IOCS1 and type III for AOCS5. For all \n\nsharks, one isolated day of any behavior type occurred more frequently than any \n\nsequence. Only one individual, shark AOCS4, seemed to show a clear shift on \n\nbehavior with time (Figure 6). During its first fifty days of monitoring, this shark \n\nexhibited type I behavior almost exclusively. After this period, shark AOCS4 \n\nstarted to intercalate type I with the other behavior types.

This unique situation \n\nenabled the incorporation of the spatial aspect into the discussion concerning the \n\nshifts between behavior types. The proportions between the three behavior types \n\nwere linked across the tracks of these individuals (Figure 7). Considering that \n\nindividuals that are simultaneously at the same location are also experiencing the \n\nsame environment, this analysis evidenced moments where environmental factors \n\ncould be the driver of their behavior. At the beginning of May, for example, sharks \n\nAOCS5 and 7 are at the same square of latitude and longitude and their \n\nbehavioral pattern is also very similar. Shark AOCS6, on the other hand, is in \n\nanother location exhibiting another behavioral pattern, indicating sharks\u2019 \n\nsurroundings could be their behavioral driver. Shark AOCS6 remained in the \n\nsame area for most of May, its behavior pattern, however, shifted completely \n\nbetween the first and second halves of the month. Again, an environmental factor \n\ncould be the driver. However, during the second half of April, sharks AOCS5 and \n\n7 are at the same location exhibiting completely different behavioral patterns. \n\nThis trend appears again during the second half of May. This would suggest that \n\nthe environment would not be the only driver of these behavioral modes. \n\n \n\n3 . 1 . 2 .  S p i k e  d i v e s  \n\n \n\nWhile examining the time series it was noted that all individuals mainly stayed \n\nwithin the first 150 m, but descended on rare occasions to depths below 150 m. \n\nLooking closely at these rare events, that accounted for only 0.15% of their \n\nmonitoring periods (Tolotti et al., 2015b), common features were identified. These \n\nfeatures, denominated spike dives, were characterized by rapid descents to \n\ndepths greater then 150 m, followed by considerably slower ascents. Two \n\nexamples of spike dives are shown of Figure 8. All individuals performed spike \n\ndives during their monitoring period, with descent rates varying from 0.14 to 1.05 \n\nm.s-1 and ascent rates varying form 0.08 to 0.26 m.s-1 (Table 3).

The models results were not \n\nunexpected, reflecting the pattern observed in Figure 10. The best-fitted models \n\nconsistently indicated a significant influence of horizontal position, mixed layer \n\ndepth (MLD) and SST on the daily vertical activity (SD). The multiple-tag model \n\nsuggested an additional effect of shark size and explained 50.1% of the deviance \n\n(R2=0.48, n=685). This model suggests an increase of vertical activity with the \n\nincrease of the MLD and size. SST seems to follow the same trend, but it was the \n\nleast significant factor on the multi-tag model (Figure 11). The individual models \n\n 123 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\nvaried slightly between sharks, with horizontal positions being always significant \n\nas opposed to MLD and SST (Figure 11). The model of shark IOCS1 had 64.7% of \n\nthe deviance explained (R2=0.63, n=97) and a positive linear effect of MLD was \n\nobserved. Shark AOCS3 model also had a good fit with 68.6% of deviance \n\nexplained (R2=0.63, n=165). Besides the positive relationship with MLD, the \n\nvertical activity of this individual was also positively correlated with SST. The \n\nmodels of AOCS5 and 6 were similar to AOCS3, but shark AOCS6 model had a \n\nweaker performance, with 40.1% of deviance explained (R2=0.34, n=98) as \n\nopposed to 68.3% for AOCS5 (R2=0.59, n=99). The model of AOCS4 had only \n\nhorizontal position as a significant factor (dev. explained 51.0%, R2=0.41, n=129). \n\nLastly, MLD was not a significant factor for AOCS7. Instead, this model suggested \n\na non-linear effect with SST, exhibiting an overall negative trend with a slight \n\nincrease close to 28\u00b0C (dev. explained 40.3%, R2=0.30, n=97). \n\n \n\nTo interpret the environment and movement variations more finely, cumulated \n\nsums of MLD, SST and SD were plotted for each individual. The cumulated sums \n\nwere subtracted by the mean and re-scaled to highlight periods when values are \n\nabove or below the mean (Figure 12). These plots reflected the models results \n\nand, in some cases, facilitated their understanding. Shark IOCS1, for instance, \n\nexhibited a perfect aligned correlation between MLD and vertical activity. When \n\nMLD is above average, and the species preferred environment expands, the SD is \n\nalso above average. The opposite trend also remains true. It is not surprising that \n\nthe GAM of this individual had MLD as a highly significant factor and a very good \n\ndegree of deviance explained. An interesting case is shark AOCS3. In the \n\nbeginning of its time series this shark exhibited the same trend observed for \n\nIOCS1. Around May, however, a major shift is seen. Instead of decreasing with \n\nMLD, vertical activity starts to increase disregarding the shrink of its preferred \n\nenvironment. During this moment it is SST that starts to reach values above \n\naverage, hence its addition as a significant factor on the model of AOSC3. This \n\nsame trend is observed for shark AOCS5. The MLD was not a significant factor for \n\nshark AOCS7 and SST was. Indeed, when looking to the cumulated sums, SD and \n\n 124 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\nMLD do not follow the same direction, while SST and SD do.

D i s c u s s i o n  \n \n\nRecent studies have shown that the oceanic whitetip shark is an epipelagic \n\npredator largely confined to the mixed layer (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; Musyl et \n\nal., 2011; Tolotti et al., 2015b), a result that was also confirmed by this study. Up \n\nuntil now, however, detailed information on how this species occupies the \n\nepipelagic environment was lacking. The present study revealed complex \n\nmovement patterns, including marked diel changes, behavior shifts and \n\nenvironmental influence on vertical activity. The combination of several analysis \n\ntools was key to identify this variety of vertical movement patterns. This work also \n\nrepresents the first description of satellite archival data form an oceanic whitetip \n\nshark in the Indian Ocean. \n\n \n\n4 . 1 .  D i e l  p a t t e r n s  \n\n \n\nPrevious research on vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks has not \n\nreported the occurrence of diel behavior (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013). Conversely, \n\ndiel patterns were observed for all six individuals analyzed in the present study. \n\nWhile variability was also noted, diel patterns occurred for at least one moment of \n\ntheir monitored time series. The most frequent pattern, classified as type I \n\nbehavior (Figure 4), was characterized by shallower depths during the day and \n\ndeeper vertical expansion during the night, resulting in deeper average depths. \n\nThe exact opposite of this diel pattern was also observed, characterized by \n\ndeeper occupation of the water column during daytime than during nighttime \n\n(type II behavior). Periods of no distinct diel patterns ware also observed (type III \n\nbehavior). Diel vertical movements are very common on species with vertical \n\nranges that exceed that of oceanic whitetips, such as blue sharks (Prionace \n\nglauca), bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias superciliosus), swordfish (Xiphias gladius) \n\nand bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) (Abecassis et al., 2012; Coelho et al., 2015; \n\nLam et al., 2014; Musyl et al., 2011, 2003). These species usually occupy deep \n\n 128 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\nwaters during the day and remain in the mixed layer during the night and are \n\nbelieved to be following the vertical migration of meso-pelagic prey species \n\nwithin the deep scattering layer (DSL) (Bernal et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nEpipelagic predators, such as oceanic whitetips, have also been reported to \n\ndisplay diel patterns. Silky sharks (C. falciformis) and mahi-mahis (Coryphaena \n\nhippurus), for example, exhibited vertical movements similar to the type I \n\nbehavior described above (Filmalter et al., 2015; Merten and Appeldoorn, 2014). \n\nAlthough inverse to the general diel migration pattern described for pelagic \n\nspecies with wide vertical ranges, type I behavior could also be linked to feeding \n\non mesopelagic prey from the DSL. Filmalter et al. (2015) reported that silky \n\nsharks were more vertically active during the night and at a similar depth to the \n\nnocturnal range of pelagic species known to track the migration of the DSL. The \n\nauthors hypothesized that these increased vertical oscillations were associated \n\nwith feeding activity. In the present study, indication of an increased vertical \n\nactivity during the night was also found, as some individuals (AOCS4, 7 and \n\nIOCS1) exhibited higher standard deviation values during this period. Oceanic \n\nwhitetip sharks are known to feed on mesopelagic squids (Backus et al., 1956) \n\nand a recent study using stable isotopes has estimated a nearly equal importance \n\nbetween squids (44%) and larger pelagic teleosts (47%) on its diet (Madigan et \n\nal., 2015). Deep excursions of oceanic whitetips are rare and could not account for \n\nsuch a significant portion of a mesopelagic species in its diet, suggesting that \n\ntype I behavior can indeed be linked to feeding on prey from the DSL during the \n\nnight. \n\n \n\nVariability on vertical movement patterns is also often reported for pelagic \n\nspecies. Five behavior types have recently been described for blue sharks, a \n\nspecies known for its marked diel migration to shallower waters during the night \n\n(Queiroz et al., 2012). These behaviors ranged from the general known diel \n\npattern to its inverse and included patterns where no diel differences were \n\napparent, just like what was observed for the oceanic whitetip sharks from this \n\n 129 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\nstudy (type III behavior). Mako (Lamna nasus) and the plankton feeding basking \n\nshark (Cetorhinus maximus) have been reported to perform opposite diel patterns \n\nduring their monitoring period too (Pade et al., 2009; Sims et al., 2005). These \n\nbehavior shifts are also believed to be linked with the availability of prey. The \n\ncited studies were able to observe that changes in the diel pattern occurred when \n\nsharks changed environments, moving from mixed coastal to well stratified off \n\nshore waters, for example (Pade et al., 2009; Queiroz et al., 2012), or because \n\nthey were mirroring prey behavior (Sims et al., 2005). For the oceanic whitetip \n\nsharks tagged in the present work, it was not possible to identify clear temporal or \n\nspatial patterns in the occurrence of the different behaviors. The types of behavior \n\nwere highly intercalated and showed no consistency across their time series \n\n(Figures 6 and 7). Oceanic whitetips are opportunistic predators (Backus et al., \n\n1956; Compagno, 1984) and the great variability seen on their vertical movement \n\npatterns could very well be linked to prey distribution, as it has been proved for \n\nother pelagic sharks. To move forward on this matter, however, additional \n\nresearch is required, as information on prey distribution in the studied areas is \n\nlacking. Data on other pelagic sharks tagged in the same areas could also provide \n\ngood insights. \n\n \n\nThe Fast Fourier Transform analysis of the recovered tag (AOCS3) revealed two \n\npeaks, indicating periodicity on vertical movements (Figure 3). The peak at 24 \n\nhours confirms the diel behavior and its broad base indicates variability. This \n\nresult is in accordance with what was observed in the previous analysis, as shark \n\nAOCS3 frequently intercalated the three types of behavior across its time series \n\n(Figure 6). Other pelagic shark species have also shown peaks corresponding to a \n\n24h cycle, which are typically interpreted as evidence of diel behavior \n\n(Brunnschweiler and Sims, 2012; Filmalter et al., 2015; Tyminski et al., 2015). The \n\npeak at 12h, however, is not reported as often for pelagic species. Usually, a \n\nspectral peak at 12h is seen on coastal species and they are linked to tidal cycles \n\n(Urmy et al., 2012). Similar to shark AOCS3, the strongest spectral peak in the \n\nperiodogram of a basking shark had a period of 12.35h (Shepard et al., 2006). \n\n 130 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\nThe authors found that the peak also matched the tidal cycle, since the shark \n\nremained in the continental shelf for the duration of its monitoring. Shark AOCS3, \n\non the other hand, remained at oceanic waters (Figure 1). Thus, it is unlikely that \n\nthe 12h spectral peak observed for this oceanic whitetip shark has any link to the \n\ntidal cycle. Instead, the 12h peak could be related to the crepuscular pattern. \n\nOceanic whitetip sharks occupied considerable shallower depths during \n\ncrepuscular hours (Figure 2). Coincidentally, at equatorial latitudes day and night \n\nhave similar lengths, resulting in a crepuscular event every 12h (World of Earth \n\nScience, 2003). Shark AOCS3 stayed at equatorial latitudes for the totality of its \n\ntrack, indicating that 12h spectral peak of vertical movement matches the \n\ncrepuscular cycle. The crepuscular pattern of vertical movements was consistent \n\nthroughout the time series of all six individuals, and was also identified for oceanic \n\nwhitetips tagged in the Pacific Ocean (Musyl et al., 2011). The sharpness of the \n\n12h peak suggests that this crepuscular pattern is a major part of oceanic whitetip \n\nbehavioral repertoire. Southern bluefin tunas (T. maccoyii) exhibited increased \n\nactivity during crepuscular hours, including pronounced ascents to the surface at \n\ncivil twilight (Willis et al., 2009). The authors hypothesized that this behavior had \n\norientation purposes because twilight is the best-suited moment for the detection \n\nof celestial polarization patterns, and also because birds and marine mammals are \n\nknown to use this patterns as navigational cues. This orientation hypothesis could \n\nexplain the crepuscular behavior of oceanic whitetip sharks, especially \n\nconsidering that they spent considerably more time at the firsts 10 m of the water \n\ncolumn during crepuscular hours. It is important to note, however, that studies \n\nabout the sensitivity of oceanic whitetips to polarized light have never been \n\nconducted. \n\n \n\n4 . 2 .  S p i k e  d i v e s  \n\n \n\nOceanic whitetip sharks tagged in the North Atlantic (Bahamas) were reported to \n\nperform sporadic deep dives to the mesopelagic zone, down to 1082m (Howey-\n\nJordan et al., 2013). Similar to the deep dives observed in the present work, dives \n\n 131 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\nof oceanic whitetips from the Bahamas study had descent rates significantly faster \n\nthan ascent rates, forming a v-shaped profile. However, unlike most sharks of the \n\npresent study, Bahamian sharks performed deep dives mostly at night. The \n\ndifference between the period of when oceanic whitetips performed deep dives \n\ncould simply be due to area particularities, however one of the South Atlantic \n\nsharks also performed spike dives mostly during the night (shark AOCS7). These \n\ncontrasting periods and the rarity of these deep events make it difficult to \n\nunderstand what is driving them. In any case, similar shaped deep dives are \n\nrelatively common among pelagic sharks and are often believed to be associated \n\nwith prey searching behavior (Hoffmayer et al., 2013; Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; \n\nSepulveda et al., 2004; Tyminski et al., 2015). Gleiss et al. (2011) suggested that v-\n\nshaped dives might help sharks to efficiently scan the water column for food \n\npatches while expending minimal energy. They also suggested that slower ascent \n\nrates might improve the chances of pelagic predators to detect prey because \n\nbacklighting is improved during ascents. \n\n \n\nIf prey searching is the driver behind the occasional spike dives observed for \n\noceanic whitetip sharks, they could have been triggered after sharks remained in \n\nless productive surface waters for prolonged periods. It has been hypothesized \n\nthat deep dives observed on whale sharks in the Indian Ocean were triggered \n\nwhen individuals were crossing less productive areas (Brunnschweiler and Sims, \n\n2012). Another possible hypothesis for the occurrence of spike dives is the search \n\nfor navigational cues through magnetic gradients (Willis et al., 2009). Sea floor \n\nmagnetic anomalies associated with bathymetric features form a predictable \n\ngridded pattern believed to aid navigation (Walker et al., 2002). Sharks can detect \n\nmagnetic fields (Kalmijn, 1982) and deep dives might be a mechanism to acquire \n\nthese magnetic cues (Gleiss et al., 2011; Tyminski et al., 2015). The two proposed \n\nhypotheses behind deep dives are plausible and not mutually exclusive. \n\nTherefore, it is possible that the isolated spike dives performed by oceanic \n\nwhitetip sharks can be triggered by both foraging and navigational purposes \n\ndepending on the circumstances. \n\n 132 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\n4 . 3 .  V e r t i c a l  m o v e m e n t s  a n d  t h e  e n v i r o n m e n t  \n\n \n\nWater temperature is a limiting factor for species whose body temperature is \n\ndependent on the external environment, as it represents a central factor \n\ncontrolling their physiological processes (Sims, 2003). For a species like the \n\noceanic whitetip shark, which occupies the tropical epipelagic niche (Howey-\n\nJordan et al., 2013; Musyl et al., 2011; Tolotti et al., 2015b), variations of the warm \n\nmixed layer are expected to play a major role on the species vertical movements. \n\nThe present research confirmed this strong relationship by modeling the daily \n\nstandard deviation of depth readings as proxy of vertical movement amplitude. \n\nThe GAMs showed that tagged oceanic whitetips tended to be more widely \n\ndispersed in the water column as the depth of the mixed layer increased and, \n\nconsequently, their preferred habitat expanded. This same relationship was \n\nrecently observed for another tropical epipelagic species. Mahi-mahis tagged in \n\nthe Pacific Ocean extended their vertical depth ranges as the thermocline depth \n\nincreased (Furukawa et al., 2014). Only one shark (AOCS7) displayed a different \n\nbehavior. Although tagged with other two sharks and remaining in similar areas, \n\nshark AOS7 vertical movements did not follow MLD variations. This shark was also \n\nthe only individual to perform spike dives mostly at night. Given the small sample \n\nsize of the present work, it is interesting to see such remarkable differences in \n\nbehavioral patterns. \n\n \n\nBesides mixed layer depth, other factors were found to influence the vertical \n\nmovements of tagged oceanic whitetip sharks. The combined GAM indicated an \n\neffect of individual size, where larger individuals tended to have wider utilization \n\nof the water column. Figure 2, displaying average depth per hour, also suggests \n\nthat vertical distribution might vary with shark size. This effect is likely a reflex of \n\nthe increased thermal inertia that results from larger body mass, enabling larger \n\nindividuals to expand their thermal habitat (Neill et al., 1976, 1974; Wilson et al., \n\n2006). A possible effect of size on the vertical movements of oceanic whitetips \n\nand silky sharks has also been reported on a tagging study conducted off Hawaii \n\n 133 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\n(Musyl et al., 2011). Large individuals (>200 m) of these two closely related \n\nspecies were separated form the juveniles in a cluster analysis based on their \n\nvertical movements. \n\n \n\nOceanic whitetip sharks tagged in the Bahamas exhibited a correlation between \n\naverage daily depth and sea surface temperature (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013). \n\nThe authors observed that when individuals experienced warmer SST, average \n\ndaily depth increased. For the oceanic whitetips from the present study, most \n\nGAMs also indicated a positive relationship between vertical movement and SST. \n\nInterestingly, for two individuals (AOCS3 and 5), this relationship occurred at the \n\nsame time when the relationship between mixed layer depth and vertical \n\nmovement was inverted. In short, when SST was above average these two sharks \n\nincreased their vertical activity disregarding the shrink of the mixed layer. This \n\npattern might indicate behavioral thermoregulation. The oceanic whitetips could \n\nbe either using the warmer SST to accumulate heat and explore cooler deep \n\nwaters or diving below the thermocline to cool down. Howey-Jordan et al. (2013) \n\nalso suggested that the correlation between SST and average depth observed for \n\nthe Bahamian oceanic whitetips could be evidence for thermoregulation. In fact, \n\nthe use or active avoidance of heat sources to regulate body temperature has \n\nbeen reported for other shark species (Campana et al., 2011; Speed et al., 2012; \n\nVianna et al., 2013). There is evidence supporting that behavioral \n\nthermoregulation optimizes physiological and metabolic processes (Sims, 2003). \n\nFor the oceanic whitetip shark where high-resolution temperature data was \n\navailable, a significant relationship between the daily temperature range and SST \n\nwas observed. When SST increased the temperature range increased too. A \n\nsimilar relationship was reported for blue sharks (Campana et al., 2011). The \n\nauthors also reported an increase in maximum depth with SST. In contrast, shark \n\nAOCS3 depth range did not vary significantly with SST (Figure 13). Campana et al. \n\n(2011) hypothesized that blue sharks exhibited behavioral thermoregulation to \n\nreduce metabolic losses and increase foraging efficiency. The reduced sample \n\nsize of the present work prevents further discussion concerning behavioral \n\n 134 \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks \n \n\n\t\n\nthermoregulation on oceanic whitetip sharks. Still, even with the clear need for \n\nmore data, results indicate that the accumulation of heat plays an important role \n\non the species vertical movement. It seems that the warmer SST allows oceanic \n\nwhitetips to tolerate greater temperature gradients without limiting their vertical \n\nmovements. \n\n \n\nLongline is the main gear responsible for the fishing impacts on oceanic whitetip \n\nshark populations (Rice and Harley, 2012). Given that this fishing gear \n\nconsiderably overlaps with the vertical behavior of the species (Tolotti et al., \n\n2015b), it is important to continue our efforts to better understand its behavioral \n\npatterns and the drivers behind these patterns. When dealing with rare \n\nthreatened animals, such as the oceanic whitetip shark, sample size is constrained \n\nby opportunity. This study was based on only 6 individuals, but the total of 538 \n\ndays of observations in the Atlantic Ocean and 100 days of observations in the \n\nIndian Ocean already provided new information on the species. Nevertheless, the \n\nscientific community should direct its efforts to increase the number of tagged \n\nindividuals, including different areas. Electronic tags are resourceful non-lethal \n\ninstruments that can significantly improve our knowledge on the ecology of this \n\nthreatened species and, consequently, aid its conservation. \n\n \n\n5 .

M a i n  f i n d i n g s  \n \n\nManagement of pelagic sharks is a complex issue. Their mortality is primarily due \n\nto incidental catches from tuna fisheries worldwide, but, despite incidental, catch \n\nrates are high. The shared habitat between pelagic sharks and target species is \n\nthe primary cause of their incidental captures, but they are also considered a \n\nwelcome bycatch. Shark fins are a luxury commodity in the Asian cuisine and their \n\ntrade is very profitable (Clarke, 2007). The legislation set out by tuna RFMOs only \n\nprevents retention, and not actual capture. Given this scenario, banning measures \n\nwill have little impact on fisher-behavior and the high-level of pelagic shark \n\nmortality is likely to continue. A set of integrated measures will more effectively \n\naid in the conservation and recovery of threatened pelagic sharks. These \n\nmeasures should mainly include: (1) the development of alternative fishing \n\ntechniques; and (2) the reduction of fishing effort, e.g. developing spatial or \n\ntemporal management measures such as closed areas/seasons. Monitoring is also \n\nvital for any successful management system and the implementation and/or \n\nexpansion of observer programs must be encouraged (Chapter 2). \n\n \n\nAnalysis of observer data from the Brazilian longline fleet reveled that the oceanic \n\nwhitetip shark is frequently captured by this fishery (Chapter 3). The data also \n\nreveled that oceanic whitetip catches are mainly constituted of individuals under \n\nthe size at first maturity. It was not possible, however, to establish a population \n\ntrend because the observer program only dates back to 2004 and OCS catches \n\nwere not reported on the fishery\u2019s logbooks. In addition to the short time series, \n\nthe lack of a homogeneous distribution of fishing effort and strategy also \n\nhampered the utilization of CPUE as a proxy of actual abundance. It was observed \n\nthat the catchability of the species varied greatly with gear configuration (fishing \n\nstrategy). CPUE values were significantly higher for vessels using shallow longline \n\nconfiguration than those deploying hooks at greater depths. This result was later \n\nlinked with the vertical distribution of the species. \n\n 145 \n\n\n\nChapter 7: Final remarks \n\nObserver data from the French purse seine fishery in the Atlantic Ocean was also \n\nanalyzed in an attempt to establish a population trend for the oceanic whitetip \n\nshark (Chapter 4). The population status of the species in the south Atlantic, \n\nhowever, remained unclear. While in the western Atlantic the analyzed time series \n\nwas too short (Chapter 3), in the eastern Atlantic the occurrence index derived \n\nfrom the purse seine fishery was very low and did not exhibited any trend \n\n(Chapter 4). For the western Indian Ocean, besides the observer data from the \n\nFrench purse seine fleet, a historical dataset from the Soviet Union was also \n\navailable. The analysis suggested that OCS population have declined since mid \n\n1990\u2019s in this ocean (Chapter 4). \n\n \n\nThe combined analysis between tagging and fishery data from the equatorial \n\nAtlantic (Brazilian longline fleet) provided good insights towards the development \n\nof mitigation measures (Chapter 5). The results of this study indicate that oceanic \n\nwhitetip sharks spent 95% of their time above 120 m depth. This result perfectly \n\nillustrates the variations on CPUE values described in Chapter 3, as the depth \n\nrange of the longline with shallow configuration corresponds exactly to the \n\nspecies vertical distribution. Despite spending most of the time inside of the \n\nmixed layer oceanic whitetip sharks exhibited complex vertical movement \n\npatterns, including distinct diel behavioral patterns and deep diving (Chapter 6). \n\nOceanic whitetip vertical movements were also influenced by the sea surface \n\ntemperature, which suggests the occurrence of thermoregulation for the species \n\n(Chapter 6). \n\n \n\nThe evidence regarding oceanic whitetip shark vertical distribution is solid and \n\ncorroborated by other recently published works (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; \n\nMusyl et al., 2011). This information suggests that the removal of the shallow \n\nhooks from the longline gear could be proposed as technique to mitigate OCS \n\nbycatch (Beverly et al., 2009; Walsh et al., 2009). The fact that CPUE variations \n\nwere already observed suggests that this might be an effective measure. The \n\nmovement data also reveled that oceanic whitetips have some degree of \n\n 146 \n\n\n\nChapter 7: Final remarks \n\nphilopatry to the main fishing ground of the Brazilian longline fleet (Chapter 5). \n\nThe horizontal and vertical overlap between oceanic whitetip sharks and the \n\nBrazilian longline fleet raises concerns regarding the vulnerability of the species. \n\nFurthermore, fine-scale data collection for this fishery has ceased in 2012 with the \n\nsuspension of its observer program. This current situation will certainly jeopardize \n\nfuture analysis of OCS population trends. \n\n \n\n2 .  F u t u r e  r e s e a r c h  \n \n\nThis thesis provides new information on the ecology of the oceanic shark ad raises \n\nimportant conservation issues. But, as with many poorly studied species, \n\nknowledge gaps still remain and new questions have emerged. In light of what \n\nwas presented a few research initiatives are suggested. \n\n \n\nDue to the clustering of tagged oceanic whitetip sharks on the equatorial Atlantic \n\nOcean and on the first half of the year, more tagging is encouraged. It would be \n\nparticularly interesting to tag sharks\t outside the main fishing ground of the \nBrazilian longline fleet. This would provide new information to fuel the discussion \n\nregarding the philopatric behavior observed for the species and maybe evidence \n\nof other hotspots in the Atlantic. Movement patterns of oceanic whitetip sharks in \n\nthe Indian Ocean remain unknown, thus tagging efforts should also be directed to \n\nthis ocean. \n\n \n\nThere is a general consensus amongst fisheries scientists that oceanic whitetip \n\npopulations are declining at dangerous rates, if not already overfished (Baum et \n\nal., 2006; Rice and Harley, 2012). The lack of fisheries data, however, prevents a \n\nclear understanding of the situation. Historical reference points are limited and \n\nsystematic monitoring is still scarce. So far, estimations of oceanic whitetip \n\npopulation trends have relied on longline fishery data, since the species is more \n\nfrequently caught on this gear. The issue with this fishery\u2019s database is that \n\n 147 \n\n\n\nChapter 7: Final remarks \n\ncatchability is highly sensitive to variations on the gear, making standardization a \n\nchallenge (Burgess et al., 2005; Ward and Myers, 2005; Ward, 2008). For species \n\nwith a high proportion of zero catches results are often inconclusive, which was \n\nthe case with the analysis presented in Chapter 3. In the purse seine fishery \n\ncatchability is not as sensitive, as modifications of this gear are mostly related with \n\ndecreasing searching time for tuna schools. The analysis of observer data from the \n\nFrench purse seine fleet combined with historical data from the Soviet Union \n\nindicated that purse seine fishery databases could provide reliable abundance \n\ntrends (Chapter 4). Using a simple occurrence index, many data sources, \n\nespecially historic ones, could be integrated for a more robust analysis. \n\n \n\nA global assessment, including as many historical data as possible, should be \n\nconducted for the oceanic whitetip shark, but there are two main issues that need \n\nto be considered. The associative behavior of oceanic whitetip sharks around \n\nfloating objects is key for the development of abundance indexes derived from \n\nthe tuna purse seine databases. Therefore, studies on this front also need to be \n\nconducted (see Filmalter et al., 2015). Another issue is how FAD densities have \n\nevolved along the years. It is still unclear by how much FAD densities have \n\naugmented and modified the oceanic habitat, and also on how this could have \n\naffected species behavior (Dagorn et al., 2013a, 2013b; Maufroy et al., 2015). In \n\norder to estimate reliable abundance trends based on purse seine fishery data the \n\nFAD issue needs to be addressed as well. \n\n \n\n3 .
