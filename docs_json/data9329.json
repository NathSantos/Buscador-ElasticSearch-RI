Secchi 1, 2, *, Lauro Barcellos 1, Alexandre N. Zerbini 1, 3 and Luciano Dalla Rosa 1\n\nAbstract \u2013 In the late austral spring, a 3.43m long immature male dwarf minke whale (Balaenoptera accutorostrata) was accidentally\ncaught in a gillnet set in waters 143m deep, close to the continental slope off southern Brazil. A brief description of the specimen,\nincluding external measurements, colour patterns, reproductive status and skull measurements, is presented. The stomach was full\nof the euphausiid, Euphausia similis, and was heavily infested by anisakid nematode parasites. Euphausia similis is reported for the\nfirst time as a prey species for dwarf minke whales.\n\nResumo \u2013 Durante a primavera austral, um macho imaturo de baleia-minke-an\u00e3, Balaenoptera accutorostrata, medindo 3,43m, foi\ncapturado acidentalmente em uma rede de emalhe armada em \u00e1guas de 143m de profundidade, nas proximidades do talude\ncontinental sul do Brasil.

In the mid 1980s,\ntwo forms were recognised in the Southern Hemisphere\nbased primarily on body and baleen colouration as well\nas some biological parameters (Best, 1985; Arnold et al.,\n1987). The first form corresponded to Balaenoptera\nbonaerensis, described from Argentina by Burmeister\n(1865), and documented from commercial whaling\ncatches in the Antarctic (Williamson, 1959; Kasuya and\nIchihara, 1965; Doroshenko, 1979), South Africa (Best,\n1982) and Brazil (da Rocha and Braga, 1982). Despite\nearlier skepticism, B. bonaerensis has now generally been\nrecognised as a valid species, referred to as the Antarctic\nminke whale (Rice, 1998; IWC, 2001). The second form\nwas a previously unrecognised diminutive form, now\nmore popularly called the dwarf minke whale. Based on\nboth morphological (Best, 1985; Arnold et al., 1987;\nZerbini and Sim\u00f5es-Lopes, 2000) and molecular (Wada\net al., 1991; Pastene et al., 1994) data, the dwarf minke\nwhale has been considered more closely related to the\nNorthern Hemisphere B .  a c u t o r o s t r a t a  than to the\nAntarctic minke whale, but its taxonomic status remains\nunclear, pending further study (IWC, 2001).\nThe dwarf minke whale has been reported near all\ncontinents of  the Southern Hemisphere (see Baker, 1983;\nBest, 1985; Marsh, 1985; Arnold et al., 1987; Baldas and\nCastello, 1986; Zerbini et al., 1996; Arnold, 1997), as well\nas in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters (Kato et al. 1990,\nKasamatsu et al., 1993; Aguayo, 1994). The southernmost\nrecord of this species was based on one animal sighted\nduring winter at 69o25\u2019S (Aguayo, 1994). In Brazil,\n\nsightings are rare, but dwarf minke whale records\nrepresent about 75% of all minke whale strandings\n(Zerbini et al., 1996).\nAlthough some biological data were collected from\nindividuals caught during commercial (da Rocha and\nBraga, 1982; Best, 1985) and scientific whaling (Kato et al.,\n1990), or through accidental capture (Marsh, 1985; Arnold\net al., 1987), the biology of the dwarf minke whale remains\npoorly documented.  In this report, we present new\ninformation based on a fresh specimen, accidentally caught\nin fishing gear.\n\nSpecimen description and discussion\n\nOn 25 November 1992, a 3.43m long young male dwarf\nminke whale (Fig. 1) was incidentally caught in a gillnet\nset for sharks at a depth of 143m. The net was 6,000m\nlong and 4m high, with 30cm stretched mesh size. The\ncapture occurred south of Rio Grande (33o35\u201966\u201dS -\n51o29\u201980\u201dW), Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil.\nIt is not known, however, whether the animal was caught\nwhen the net was set at the bottom or during the setting/\nh a u l i n g  p r o c e d u r e .  T h e  a n i m a l  w a s  b r o u g h t  b y\nfishermen and landed while still fresh at a fishing facility\nof Rio Grande. Subsequently, the whale was transported\nto the Museu Oceanogr\u00e1fico \u201cProf. Eli\u00e9zer C. Rios\u201d, where\ni t  w a s  d i s s e c t e d .  E x t e r n a l  c o l o u r  p a t t e r n s  w e r e\nexamined, organs were collected and weighed, stomach\ncontents, including parasites, were preserved. After\ncleaning and preparation, the skeleton was deposited\nin the marine mammal collection (MORG 0096) of the\nMuseu Oceanogr\u00e1fico.\n\nExternal morphology and colouration: External measurements\nand some organ weights are presented in Table 1.\n\n\n\n110                                                               E.R.SECCHI, L.BARCELLOS, A.N.ZERBINI and L.DALLA ROSA\n\nLAJAM 2(2): 109-115, July/December 2003\n\nMeasurements were comparable to dwarf minke whales\nfrom other regions (Best, 1985; Arnold et al., 1987). The\nmore anterior position of the dorsal fin observed in the\npresent specimen support the hypothesis that this\nfeature may have taxonomic value to distinguish the\ndwarf minke whale from other minke whale types.\nColour patterns were also similar to the ones described\nfor the dwarf minke whale by Best (1985) and Arnold et\nal. (1987). The base of the flippers was white and\nconnected to a nearly rounded white blaze on the\nshoulder (Fig.1a). The dark pigmentation extended from\nthe back onto the area between the eyes and the anterior\ninsertion of the flipper, continuing as a dark throat patch\nwhich covered the ten uppermost ventral grooves just\nunder and behind the angle of the mouth (Fig.1a).\nHowever, this specimen presented a striking dark lateral\nwave-like patch located in the flank of the whale (Fig.1a),\nextending from just before the anterior insertion of the\ndorsal fin almost to the ventral grooves (Fig.1b).  A similar\nfeature was observed in another young dwarf minke\nwhale collected in Australia (Paterson, 1994).\nNot all baleen plates were kept so an accurate count can\nnot be provided. The colour of the preserved plates was\nsimilar to the ones reported for dwarf minke whales\ncollected in South Africa and Australia (Best, 1985;\nArnold et al., 1987). Most plates were light yellowish and\na few presented a narrow external dark border. This\nborder\u2019s breadth corresponded to up to 5% of the width\nof the plate.\n\nSkeleton: Cranial measurements are presented in Table\n2, while pictures of the skull were illustrated by Zerbini\net al. (1996, Fig.3). The following cranial characters were\nobserved in the present specimen: the parietals were\nincorporated in the vertex and were in contact with the\ninterparietal. The latter was exposed and presented a\nsomewhat rhomboidal shape. The anterior border of\nthe supraoccipital was curved posteriorly in the midline\nof the skull and the hamular process of the pterigoyds\nwas narrow and elongated. These were previously\nd e s c r i b e d  a s  d i a g n o s t i c  f o r  d w a r f  m i n k e  w h a l e s\n(Arnold et al., 1987; Zerbini and Sim\u00f5es-Lopes, 2000).\nT h e  v e r t e b r a l  f o r m u l a  w a s  C 7 - T 1 1 - L 1 0 - C a 1 8 .  T h e\nvertebral epiphyses were not fused.\n\nReproductive status: The testes were very small. Both\nmeasured 9.3cm of length and were clearly undeveloped.\nThe size of the specimen, i.e. 3.43m, and external analysis\nof the testes indicated its immature status. Information\nfrom animals caught in whaling activities suggests that\nmale dwarf minke whales reach sexual maturity at\napproximately 6m (e.g. Best, 1985; Kato, 1991).\n\nParasite infestation: Despite the small size of this animal,\nits stomach was heavily infested by at least two nematode\ns p e c i e s  o f  t h e  g e n e r a  A n i s a k i s  ( a b o u t  3 % )  a n d\nPseudoterranova (about 97%). Further analyses, including\nmolecular methods, may help determine the species\nidentification of these nematodes. No parasites were\nfound either in the intestines or any other organ though\n\nno fine search was performed. The genus Anisakis has also\nbeen found in the stomach of an adult dwarf minke whale\nstranded in New Zealand (Dawson and Slooten, 1990).\nStudies on North Pacific minke whales (Araki et al., 1997)\nand Antarctic minke whales (Dailey and Vogelbein, 1991)\nindicated only Anisakis in the stomachs. There is an early\nrecord of Pseudoterranova decipiens  from Northern\nHemisphere minke whales (from Delyamure, in Tomilin,\n1967) but the accuracy of this information is uncertain\ngiven the complex taxonomy of Anisakidae parasites.\nNematode parasites of the family Anisakidae, including\nthe genera Anisakis, Contracaecum, Pseudoterranova (=\nTerranova, Phocanema, Porrocaecum) are composed of\ns e v e r a l  c o m p l e x e s  o f  s i b l i n g  s p e c i e s  a n d  a r e  t h e\nnematodes most commonly reported from the stomachs\nof cetaceans (Dailey, 2001). Heavy infections of these\nparasites rarely cause clinical signs, but can result in\ngastritis and ulceration (Dailey, 2001).\n\nDiet: The stomach was almost full of Euphausia similis,\nsuggesting that dwarf minke whales may wean at much\nsmaller sizes than Antarctic minke whales, given that\nthe latter measure approximately 2.8m at birth. This\ne u p h a u s i i d  i s  c o n s i d e r e d  a n  i m p o r t a n t  p r e y  f o r\nbalaenopterid whales (Kawamura, 1980). Despite the\nextensive review on the food of baleen whales around\nthe world (Kawamura, 1980) and specifically in the\nSouthern Ocean (Kawamura, 1994), this euphausiid\nspecies has not previously been reported in the diet of\ndwarf minke whales.  Dwarf minke whales taken in the\nAntarctic fed primarily on myctophid fishes (e.g. Kato\net al., 1989).\nIn the western South Atlantic E. similis seems to occur\nf r o m  t h e  A b r o l h o s  B a n k  r e g i o n  ( c a  1 6 o t o  1 9 oS )\nnortheastern Brazil to the Uruguayan continental shelf\n(ca 34o to 35oS) (Ramirez, 1971; 1973; T\u00f4ha, 1981; Freire,\n1991; Gorri, 1995; Muxagata, 1999). According to Gorri\n(1995), this euphausiid has its centre of dispersion in\nwarm waters and is an indicator species of the influence\nof the warm Brazil Current in the southern Rio Grande\ndo Sul State, southern Brazil (Gorri, 1995). In this area,\nE. similis is abundant, representing 40-60% of the\nzooplankton captured in sampling nets in the spring and\nsummer (Gorri, 1995).  E. similis occurs in neritic waters\n(T\u00f4ha, 1981; Muxagata, 1999), where sightings of dwarf\nminke whales have been reported in recent years (Hassel\net al., 2003; Zerbini et al., 1997). The more neritic\nd i s t r i b u t i o n  p a t t e r n  o f  d w a r f  m i n k e  w h a l e s  h a d\npreviously been well documented off South Africa (Best,\n1985) and off eastern Australia (Arnold, 1997).\nSince E. similis typically inhabits mild and warm waters,\nits lack in the checklist of prey species in the minke whales\u2019\ndiet probably is because most data come from animals\ncaught in high latitudes. However, the species is not\nincluded among the euphausiids found in the stomach of\nminke whales in medium latitudes from waters off Durban,\nSouth Africa (Best, 1982), which were: E. diomedea, E. lucens\nand E. recurva. The \u201ckrill\u201d (certainly not E. superba) found\nin at least 3% of the analysed stomachs of minke whales\n\n\n\n                              BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON A DWARF MINKE WHALE CAUGHT IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL                                 111\n\nLAJAM 2(2): 109-115, July/December 2003\n\ncaught during whaling activities in northeastern Brazil\n(Williamson, 1975) is probably not E. similis as the whales\nwere killed mostly in oceanic waters and further beyond\nthe northern limit of this eupahusid range. Although it is\nalready known that balaenopterids may feed outside their\nregular feeding grounds in high latitudes whenever plenty\nof prey is available (e.g. Kawamura, 1975; 1980),  this record\nof E. similis is the only data available on food of dwarf\nminke whales in mid latitudes. No records exist for the\n\nSouth African specimens (P. Arnold, pers. commn) and\nwhales seen at low latitudes in Australia have not been\nseen feeding (Birtles et al., 2002).\nRecords of juveniles of dwarf minkes throughout much\nof the year along the Brazilian coast suggest that at least\nsome individuals do not migrate to Antarctic waters\n(Zerbini et al., 1996; 1997) and may explore locally high\nproductive coastal areas off eastern South America (e.g.\nHassel et al., 2003).\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFigure 1.
