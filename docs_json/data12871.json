More precisely, this work \n\nconducts a critical literature review on the concentration-induced voltage losses (i.e., \n\nconcentration polarization) resulting from mass transfer limitations. Thus, the overall object of \n\nthis work was to stress awareness of the limits of mathematical models studied and developed \n\nin the SOFC literature to date, and which are specifically related to concentration polarization \n\nprocesses. To a great extent, the design of SOFC porous layers is likened to that of optimizing \n\nthe transport of multicomponent gas mixtures in structured porous catalysts, for which \n\ndiffusional and flow limitations are of cardinal importance. In both cases, severe \n\ninconsistencies in mass transport models cannot be simply ignored and the main uncertainties \n\nin utilizing such models should be clarified. It is hoped that the information herein will serve \n\nusefully to support future developments of more consistent theoretical frameworks, thereby \n\nimproving the confidence on the results of numerical simulations. \n\n \nThe critical literature review has been carried out so to identify a number of physical \n\ninconsistences, ill-defined approximations, and misleading mathematical derivations. Along the \n\nreview, it is argued that the choice (or, more properly, the lack of conceptual refinement) of a \n\nparticular mathematical model can significantly impair the \u201cprediction\u201d of transport processes \n\nrelevant to concentration-induced power losses in SOFCs. One of the keystones of this work \n\nwas therefore to re-interpret and thus to reassess the frequently contradictory literature related \n\nto certain classes of gas-phase transport models pertinent to the evaluation of concentration \n\npolarization. With this revisionary approach, it is expected that one could reduce confusion, \n\nclear up apparent contradictions, and improve the possibility of gaining new insights.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Solid-oxide fuel cell.

In this regard, mathematical modeling and numerical simulation \n\nconstitute a valuable tool in the evaluation of multi-physics phenomena in SOFCs, inasmuch \n\nas one can examine, in a relatively straightforward manner, the effects of different design \n\nparameters and operating conditions on fuel cell performance. Furthermore, in situations \n\nwhere multiple physical scales play a part, this performance is also governed by the interplay \n\nof microscopic processes whose simultaneous interaction can give rise to complex (and often \n\nnonintuitive) coupling effects associated to disparate space and time scales, ultimately \n\naffecting the macroscopic (\u201cexperimentally observable\u201d) performance of SOFCs. It is thus \n\nunlikely that simplified single-scale models are able to accurately depict the performance of all \n\nindividual components of a system (see Fig. 1.1), when the macroscale manifestation of \n\nmicroscale physics stem from such complex process convolution. In this case, the competence \n\nto make an otherwise scale-resolved appraisal of SOFC operation relies on a multiscale \n\nmodeling approach\n[ 1, 2]\n\n.  \n\nAlthough truly faithful multiscale models of any complete fuel cell system are in principle \n\nimpossible to attain, excess use of empiricisms and usage of distributed-parameter models in \n\nthe SOFC literature (i.e., when these are misused and misinterpreted) help to further obscure \n\nthe physical meaning of a number of natural processes that one is trying to describe, thus \n\nprecluding a reliable interpretation of both numerical simulation results and experimental data. \n\nIn this context, it is expected that this dissertation work will provide a useful contribution and \n\nfulfill the particular need for a better theoretical judgment of a few but important topics related \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 2 \n \n\nto the computational modeling of gas-phase transport phenomena, which are necessary to the \n\nevaluation of concentration polarization (concentration-induced voltage losses) in high-\n\ntemperature SOFCs. By bringing the discussion of such topics to the fore, one hopes to unveil \n\nthe strong contrast between the real complexity of SOFCs and the crudity of some of the \n\nmathematical modeling techniques frequently used in the literature. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.1: Scheme illustrating the multiscale nature of a SOFC (picture reproduced from [ 3]). \n\n \n\nDuring the laborious task of understanding and reviewing the body of literature, it was \n\nfound that many pertinent remarks and critical assessments on mass transport, relevant to \n\nSOFC modeling, had been already drawn by authors from late 50\u2019s until late 90\u2019 s. However, \n\nequally many of those findings have been either obscured over the years or disregarded by \n\nunfavorable, cursory analyzes. Therefore, although limiting the literature review to only recent \n\nand high impact publications constitutes a prolific research path, a drawback of this choice is \n\nthe possibility to stumble upon some \u201cvicious circle\u201d of a defective theory or model. In this \n\ncase, presumably, \u201chidden issues\u201d remain to be dealt with at a later time, as appear necessary \n\nto the researcher concerned enough to controvert the views on that theory. On the other hand, \n\nthe in-depth scrutiny of all current theories on mass transport constitutes a near impossible \n\nundertaking. Such endeavor would certainly entail an overwhelming store of existing \n\nknowledge, and for this reason an all-embracing scrutiny of existing theories was not pursued \n\nin this dissertation. Moreover, it would be also a substantial undertaking to overturn the vested \n\nassumptions (and long-held preconceived interests) of an entire class of consolidated \n\nmodeling frameworks that have been produced by scholars from past generations. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 3 \n \n\nTherefore, neither new mass transfer theories will be introduced nor will be the existing \n\ntheories significantly advanced in the pages that follow. This is to say that the present work is \n\nnot about the much-needed critical review and reconciliation of the phenomenological theory of \n\ntransport phenomena with the results from statistical mechanics or extended non-equilibrium \n\nthermodynamic theories. Even though the current distance between applied \n\nmathematicians/physicists and engineers (especially chemical engineers) has become \n\nsomewhat large, with the current macroscale phenomenological theory still mired in misleading \n\nand erroneous assumptions made by previous models devised at the beginning of 20th \n\ncentury\n1\n, the analyses in this work have been confined to a chiefly revisionary character, \n\ncovering only an superset of existing modeling techniques that have been applied specifically \n\nin the SOFC literature, without scrutinizing, however, the actual theoretical foundation on which \n\nsuch techniques has been built. \n\nThe fact that more fundamental underlying theories (which, as mentioned above, are \n\nfallible to their nature) will not be analyzed in this work does not prevent the author from \n\ncritically reviewing and appraising, without significant loss of pertinence and generality, the \n\nmathematical models that were developed using these theories in order to assess \n\nconcentration polarization effects in SOFCs. The justifying reason is that these mathematical \n\nmodels have been, nevertheless, successfully applied to understand and predict natural \n\nprocesses of scientific and engineering interest in the field of SOFC research. That said, \n\nhowever, and more so given that the limitations of the founding theory are not well known, \n\nthese modeling techniques are not without identifiable trade-offs and, first and foremost, \n\nwithout limits of validity. Thus, even though the scrutiny of existing mass transfer theories is \n\nnot a plausible alternative in this dissertation, one should still justify the physical pertinence \n\nand perceive the uncertainties of derived mathematical models (\u201csuperset of modeling \n\ntechniques\u201d). With such critical perspective, it is of interest of this work to revisit a number of \n\nmodels on transport phenomena that have been applied to the modeling of mass transport in \n\nSOFCs, motivated by the following concerns and considerations: \n\nI. Try to identify ambiguities when evaluating \u201ccause-effect\u201d relations, which are \n\ntypical of lumped (distributed) parameter models. On this wise one would be able \n\nto properly recognize what factors are causing the system to behave in one way \n\nand not another. This level of distinction is relevant from both equipment \n\nengineering and optimization perspectives. Even though there are times when a \n\nsimplified description for the physical system is necessary, the undervaluation of \n\nmodel\u2019s simplifying assumptions may render experimental conclusions biased. \n\n                                                      \n1\n Some of the shortcomings of the so-called (linear) phenomenological transport theory, or of any theory based on \n\nthe macroscale-continuum hypothesis, are related to the inability or limitation of this theory in accounting for the \nfact that the properties of gas systems can depend on the details about the magnitude and motions of their more \nbasic constituents (molecules). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 4 \n \n\nII. Discuss mathematical models for their advantages and limitations (i.e., trade-offs), \n\ntaking into consideration the credibility of model predictions based on the \n\nevidence of uncertainties that are associated with modeling errors. Ultimately, this \n\nshould permit a more accurate picture of fuel cell macroscale performance. \n \n\nIII. It is plausible (and practical) that physical models may have a number of \n\nundisclosed assumptions and emphasis not spelled out in words that are, at some \n\nlevel, familiar to those researchers accustomed to the scientific field wherein these \n\nmodels have been applied. The disciplined use of simplifying assumptions (that is, \n\nto make a simplifying assumption based on substantiated grounds) necessarily \n\ninvolves, to some extent, a bit of common sense (within that particular scientific \n\nfield) and also some \u201ceducated guess\u201d about the importance (impact) of the \n\nspecific assumption being made. However, if one fails to disclose a large number \n\nof important physicochemical assumptions, rationalized hypotheses are \n\nirretrievably shadowed by fallacious arguments. Thus, a simplifying assumption \n\ncan only be that which allows simplifying the analysis and must not affect the \n\nphysicochemical behavior one is trying to examine or demonstrate. In other \n\nwords, it must not constitute a critical assumption that can undermine the proper \n\ndescription of that behavior. \n\n \nMost of the developments in Chapter 4 are in the lines of what was just introduced \n\nabove, which is of a critical review driven by the importance of thoroughly understanding the \n\nmodel\u2019s assumptions, including the identification of possible physical inconsistences, ill-defined \n\napproximations, and misleading mathematical derivations, where these are deemed as \n\nrelevant factors in the model prediction capability. On the other hand, the discussions \n\npresented in Chapter 2 (more precisely in \u00a7\u00a72.3) and in Chapter 3 (more precisely in \u00a7\u00a73.3) \n\ngo beyond the mere revisionary task; instead they propose some new analyses whose appeal \n\nis chiefly theoretical and whose value is the disambiguation of important concepts often \n\nmisprized and/or misrepresented in the SOFC literature, but which are nonetheless critical to \n\nthe proper definition and thus the evaluation of concentration-induced voltage losses. \n\nFinally, it should be (once more) underlined that this work lacks a focused assessment \n\nof multicomponent mass transfer theories based on idealized \u201ccapillary pore spaces\u201d, which \n\nare frequently used as a modeling abstraction for the pore-level information in macroscale \n\nphenomenological models. In this respect, the description of what (supposedly) occurs at the \n\npore level represents additional sources of flagrant oversimplifications (i.e., misrepresentations \n\nof transport processes) made by many SOFC models, potentially undermining the correct \n\nevaluation of SOFC macroscale performance. This most critical topic is, however, beyond the \n\nscope of this dissertation. Even though the present work certainly establishes a relevant \n\nacademic territory, it also readily recommends further research by acknowledging the \n\npreviously mentioned limitation. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 5 \n \n\n \n\nThis work has been subdivided into four (4) main chapters and a final chapter in which \n\noverall conclusions are drawn and an outlook for future works is proposed. These main \n\nchapters may be summarized as follows: \n\n? Chapter 1 (General Introduction): this chapter starts with a short introduction to \n\nsolid-oxide fuel cell, its components, its principles of operation, and its key design \n\nfeatures, all of which constitute a very basic and yet still necessary knowledge for \n\nunderstanding the physicochemical processes that will be addressed in later \n\nchapters. However, in order to not lose sight of the purpose of this work, these \n\ninitial sections have been kept as simple as possible. Besides introducing more \n\nformal aspects of SOFCs, this chapter also provides an overview of what will be \n\nexamined in the next chapters concerning the mathematical modeling of (single-\n\ncell) SOFCs. \n \n\n? Chapter 2 (Preliminaries on the Physical Chemistry of SOFCs): the general \n\n(macroscopic) equilibrium thermodynamics of SOFCs is presented, followed by a \n\nshort description of the main forms of irreversibilities (usually referred to as \n\npolarizations) associated with cells operating out of equilibrium. These \n\npolarizations ultimately lead to irreversible power losses, which are often \n\nquantified as voltage drops with respect to the cell reversible (\u201cmaximum\u201d) \n\nthermodynamic voltage. A theoretical discussion has also been prepared on the \n\nprecise definition of SOFC polarizations in order to pinpoint a number of \n\ninconsistencies found in the literature. \n \n\n? Chapter 3 (Mass Transport Limitations and Concentration Losses): in this chapter \n\nthe main topic of concentration-induced voltage losses (\u201cconcentration \n\npolarization\u201d) is introduced, wherein the concept of mass (and possibly \n\nmomentum) transport limitations is related to other SOFC properties and \n\nprocesses such as electrochemical potentials, limiting (or saturation) current \n\ndensities, Nernstian losses, kinetic (or surface overvoltage) losses, and other \u201cless \n\ncommon\u201d types of mass transfer cross-effects (e.g., Soret-Dufour and mechano-\n\nchemical effects). \n \n\n? Chapter 4 (Modeling Techniques for Concentration Polarization): this chapter \n\ndiscusses the modeling techniques commonly used in the SOFC literature that are \n\nconcerned to the evaluation of concentration polarization. The discussion is \n\ncentered on governing equations and closure relations pertinent only to the \u201cgas-\n\nphase\u201d (i.e., to reactive multicomponent gas flow). Inevitably, though, \n\nelectrochemical reactions and charge transport are addressed as well for the sake \n\nof information completeness and contextualization of the problem being modeled \n\n(however, these topics are not treated at length since they are not the focus of this \n\nwork). This section is in the lines of a \u201ccritical review\u201d, serving the purpose of \n\nhighlighting opportunities for improvement and clarification of existing models. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFuel cells have their origin in the conceptual idea of an efficient two-step fuel \n\ncombustion process with generation of charged species as intermediates, as first asserted in \n\n1839 by the Swiss scientist Christian Friedrich Schoenbein, and later on materially realized by \n\nSir William Grove\n[ 4]\n\n, who in the same year published the experimental observation of voltage \n\nin a concentration cell (when combining hydrogen and oxygen gases in the presence of \n\nplatinum). The realization that fuel cells could theoretically produce electricity in a more \n\nefficient way than conventional (i.e., without bottoming-cycle) thermal engines was possible \n\njust after electrochemistry was connected with thermodynamics, in the end of the nineteenth \n\ncentury. Certainly, this finding became a captivating force drawing research and development \n\nefforts into pursing fuel cells as potential efficient power generation devices.  \n\nThe solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an alternative energy-conversion device that \n\nconverts the chemical energy stored in fuels (such as   ,   ,    ) into electricity, through a \n\nseries of chemical and electrochemical reactions\n[ 4]\n\n. SOFC is a complete solid-state device that \n\nuses an ion-conducting ceramic material as the electrolyte, which is sandwiched in between \n\ntwo electrodes (anode and cathode, according to Fig. 1.2). SOFCs also produce a significant \n\namount of heat (\u201cbyproduct\u201d), which can be harnessed in combined heat and power (CHP) \n\nsystems to take advantage of this wasted heat. Likewise, the excess of heat can also be used \n\nto sustain endothermic reforming reactions of certain hydrocarbons to produce H2-enriched \n\ngas for effectively fueling the SOFC. More specifically, SOFCs allow the use of a variety of \n\nfuels because the anode can serve as an active catalyst for fuel reforming at higher operating \n\ntemperatures, typically in the range of 650 \u00b0C \u2013 1000 \u00b0C\n[ 4]\n\n. \n\nSolid electrolyte materials, as used by modern solid-oxide fuel cells, were not identified \n\nuntil the end of the nineteenth century through the discovery of Walther Nernst\n[ 5]\n\n of his so-\n\ncalled \u201cNernst Mass\u201d\n2\n.  It was a ceramic compound consisting of 85 %-mol      and 15 %-mol \n\n    , and since then this material has been applied as reference for many mixtures of      \n\nwith rare-earth and alkaline-earth oxides, with the objective of obtaining materials with high \n\nionic conductivity\n[ 6, 7]\n\n.

General Introduction and Background 8 \n \n\nWhile conventional high-temperature SOFC (HT-SOFC) usually operates between 800 \n\n\u00b0C and 1000 \u00b0C, in the period starting from early 2000\u2019s there has been a number of groups\n[ 9]\n\n \n\nfocusing on intermediate (typically operating between 650 \u00b0C and 800 \u00b0C) and low temperature \n\n(below 650 \u00b0C) SOFCs (IT-SOFC and LT-SOFC, respectively). Both designs allow wider \n\nchoices of materials and more cost-effective systems. The lower operating temperature \n\nminimizes thermally-driven material degradation and reduces stringent material requirements. \n\nTherefore, this line of research tries to bring acceptable lifetime and competitive levelized cost \n\nof electricity (LCOE) to SOFC technology\n5\n. \n\nDue to their high theoretical efficiencies, SOFCs hold a great potential to deliver \n\nattractive economics for converting fossil fuels (or renewable fuels, such as ethanol and \n\nbiogas) into useful forms of energy in a most efficient manner and with minimal environment \n\nimpact, addressing world\u2019s demand for clean and affordable energy. This is especially true \n\nwhen SOFC systems rely on CHP (i.e., bottoming-cycle with conventional thermal engines). In \n\nthe foreseeable future, SOFCs might find particular application in the niche market of \n\nstationary, distributed power generation\n[ 10]\n\n, and perhaps also as a promising energy storage \n\ntechnology through use of the so-called reversible SOFCs\n[ 11]\n\n, when they are applied as solid-\n\noxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs) to produce hydrogen gas.  However, thus far there are still \n\nsignificant technical challenges inhibiting the full commercialization and wide-scale rollout of \n\nSOFC technology.   \n\nDespite of the centenary history and the overall multibillion dollars investment over the \n\npast fifteen years, SOFCs are still somewhat far off from reaching commercial -grade \n\nperformance in the market of power sources and achieving subsidy free energy prices (i.e., \n\nwithout requiring leverage subsidies through government policy making to be a competitive \n\ntechnology). There are a number of hindrances that need to be addressed before SOFC \n\nbecome poised for (a realistic) commercial market introduction. For instance\n[ 4, 8, 9]\n\n: \n\ni.

General Introduction and Background 9 \n \n\n \n\nThere are four basic functional elements in a SOFC: electrolyte, cathode, anode, and \n\ninterconnect. The material for these components is typically ceramics, metals, or a cermet (see \n\nalso \u00a7\u00a71.3.4). More generally, a SOFC consists of two porous electrodes separated by a \n\ndense, oxide ion-conducting, ceramic electrolyte (see Fig. 1.3). These three layers when \n\nstacked together are often referred to as MEA (membrane-electrode assembly) or PEN \n\n(Positive-electrode/Electrolyte/Negative-electrode). When the PEN and interconnects are \n\ncoassembled they form a single cell, which is typically only a few millimeters thick\n[ 7, 8]\n\n. The \n\nceramics used in SOFCs do not become ionically active until it reaches high temperatures\n6\n. \n\nThe structure of the electrode is porous to ensure that both the electrolyte from one \n\nside and gas from the other \u201ccan infiltrate it\". This is to give the maximum possible contact \n\nbetween the electrode, the electrolyte, and the gas, given that phase boundary reactions occur \n\nat solid/solid/gas interfaces (at the so-called tree-phase boundary or TPB). Ideally, feed \n\nmolecules have to be distributed over the TPB as uniformly as possible and products should \n\nbe removed without significant difficulties. At this level of description, a SOFC resembles a \n\nchemical reactor that needs to be optimized with respect to geometry, materials, and operating \n\nconditions\n[ 12]\n\n.   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.3: example of a cross-section scheme of ceramic layers in a planar cell (Figure by the author). \n\n \n\nThe electric current produced by a SOFC scales with the active surface density (i.e., \n\nwith the reaction regions where gas, electrode, and electrolyte meet). To increase this density, \n\na huge number of catalyst particles are mixed with ionic and electronic conductors to form the \n\nfunctional layers of SOFC\n[ 13, 8]\n\n. Thoroughly interconnected pores in the close vicinity of TPB \n\nare needed to provide fast delivery of feed gas. However, even in well-engineered layers a \n\nlarge amount of particles might be \u201cdisconnected\u201d (i.e., non-percolated) from the electrolyte or \n\nlocated far from the pore and are, therefore, \u201cinactive\u201d for electrochemical reactions. \n\n                                                      \n6\n In this case, the observed electrical conductivity at high temperatures is attributed to the movement of oxygen \n\nvacancies under gradients of oxygen partial pressure\n[8]\n\n. \n\nTri-layer \n\nFuel channel (gas) \n\nAir channel (gas) \n\nAnode (porous) \n\nElectrolyte (dense solid) \n\nCathode (porous) \nDetail of a SEM \n(scanning electron \nmicroscope) image\n\n[14[\n. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 10 \n \n\nTo understand how the reaction between fuel and oxygen produces an electric current, \n\nand where the electrons come from, one needs to consider the separate (half) reactions taking \n\nplace at each electrode (see Fig. 1.4). Two electrochemical reactions are separated in space \n\nby an electrolyte (ionic conductor). For the reaction taking place at the cathode (also known as \n\n\u201cair electrode\u201d), oxygen gas molecules react with incoming electrons coming from the outer \n\ncircuit to form oxide ions (i.e., convert    into  \n  ), which then migrate across the electrolyte to \n\nthe anode. At the anode (also known as \u201cfuel electrode\u201d), the fuel supply (  ,    or other \n\nhydrocarbon) accepts     delivered by the electrolyte and converts it into     (and/or    ), \n\nliberating electrons which flow from the anode via external load to the cathode. These \n\nelectrons, flowing via external load, can be harnessed to do useful work (i.e., produce \n\nelectricity). The cycle then repeats itself as those electrons enter the cathode material. \n\n \nFigure 1.4: schematics of the working principle of SOFCs. Example of separate anode and cathode reactions, \nwhen using hydrogen and carbon monoxide as fuels. Oxygen is usually obtained from air, although it may be fed \npure (Figure by the author).  \n\n \n\nTo put it concisely: one of these reactions produces ions (i.e., electrons are added to a \n\nchemical species, and likewise electrons are \u201cconsumed\u201d by the reaction), in a process defined \n\nas oxygen reduction reaction. The other reaction consumes ions (i.e., electrons are removed \n\nfrom a chemical species, and likewise electrons are liberated by the reaction), in a process \n\ndefined as fuel oxidation reaction. The functionality of an electrolyte is to transport oxygen \n\ncontinuously, and solely in the form of     from cathode to anode, for which the overall driving \n\nforce is the gradient of chemical potential of oxygen\n[ 8]\n\n (with the anode having a lower partial \n\npressure of oxygen). Provided that both fuel and oxygen are supplied constantly, continuous \n\nelectrochemical reactions will steadily generate electricity. \n\nO2- \n\nO2- \nO2- \n\nO2\n- \n\nO2- \n\nH2 \n\nH2O \n\nCO \n\nCO2 \n\nO2 O2 O2 O2 \n\nFuel (reducing agent) \n\nAir (oxidizing agent) \n\nH2O + CO2 \n\ndepleted O2 \n\nheat \n\nheat \n\nH2 + CO \n\nO2 + N2 \n\npermeable \nanode \n\npermeable \ncathode \n\nimpervious \nelectrolyte \n\nH2 H2O \n\nH2 + O\n-2\n\n ?

General Introduction and Background 11 \n \n\nThe maximum cell voltage of a typical single SOFC typically reaches up to       (or \n\nabout       when drawing a useful amount of electric current), depending on temperature, \n\npressure, oxidant, and fuel consumption\n[ 13]\n\n. At such small voltage level, practical engineering \n\napplications will not be benefited. Thus, in order to build sufficient high voltage (e.g.,      ) \n\nand power throughput, multiple single cells have to be connected in series and/or parallel with \n\nthe aid of interconnects. Such collection of SOFCs in series is known as \u201cstack\u201d (see Fig. 1.5). \n\nIdeally, interconnects should make connections all over the surface of one cathode to that of \n\nthe anode of the next cell. Generally, interconnect is ribbed on both sides to allow cross -flow, \n\nco-flow, or counter-flow configurations of fuel/air flows (see Fig. 1.5).  \n\n Although a good electrical connection must be made between the two electrodes, their \n\nrespective gas supplies must be strictly separated. That is, SOFC must allow oxygen transport \n\nonly in the form of     (thus not in the form of unreacted   ). For that to be possible, dense \n\nbarriers (e.g., electrolytes, interconnects, sealing gaskets, and so forth) between air and fuel \n\nstreams have to be established to ensure that the two individual half reactions occur in \n\nisolation from one another. Ideally, interconnects should be pure electronic conductors and \n\nthus oxide-ion insulators. The electrolyte must only allow     ions to pass through it (i.e., it \n\nmust be a pure ionic conductor, ideally). Otherwise, it would be possible for electrons to go \n\nacross the electrolyte and not via the outer circuit and, in this case, the closed electrical circuit \n\nwould be lost. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 1.5: example of planar cell configuration (with cross-flow arrangement) in a SOFC stack (Figure by the \n\nauthor). \n\n \n\nInterconnect \n\nAnode \n\nElectrolyte \n\nCathode \n\nSingle \nCell \n\nStack \n\nfuel \n\nfuel \nair \n\nair \n\nelectric \ncurrent \n\ncell \nrepeat unit \n\nrepeating \nelements \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 12 \n \n\n \n\nThe intent here is to give just a brief overview about more common designs, which \n\nshould be enough to support the concepts and definitions to be used throughout this \n\ndissertation. For a more complete description about \u201cstandard\u201d SOFC designs, one should \n\nrefer to [ 8, 13]. For newest designs, including the micro tubular single-chamber SOFCs, one \n\nshould refer to [ 14]. \n\nModern SOFCs typically consist of a thin electrolyte film and supporting substrate s \n\n(including porous or channeled dense bodies for gas transport). From a geometric standpoint, \n\nthe substrate can be made into either tubular or planar shape (see Fig. 1.6). In terms of long-\n\nterm stability, the tubular concept has demonstrated the best results, while the planar design \n\npromises higher power densities\n[ 8]\n\n. The planar SOFC may be in the form of a circular disk \n\n(\u201cring type\u201d) fed with fuel from the central axis, or it may be in the form of a rectangle or square \n\nplate fed from the edges (see Figure 1.6a). Planar designs can be broken down into \n\nelectrolyte-supported, electrode-supported, interconnect-supported (metal or ceramic), inactive \n\ninsulator-supported, or active insulator-supported designs (see Fig. 1.7). SOFC design is \n\nintimately related to a particular choice on how to stabilize the cell mechanically. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6: schematics of SOFC geometrical configurations\n7\n: planar (a); and tubular (b). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.7: illustration of three different architectures of cell support types for SOFCs (Figure by the author). \n\n                                                      \n7\n Pictures reproduced from OSAKA GAS Co. website: http://www.osakagas.co.jp/en/rd/fuelcell/sofc. \n\n(a) \n\nStack Cell \n\n(O2) \nAir \n\nInterconnector \n\nAir electrode \n\nElectrolyte \n\nFuel Electrode \n\nFuel \n\n(b) \n\nCell \n\nStack \nInterconnector \n\nElectrolyte \nAir electrode \n\nFuel Electrode \n\nCathode \n\nElectrolyte \n\nAnode \n\n(a) electrolyte-supported \n\nCathode \n\nElectrolyte \n\nAnode \n\n(b) anode-supported \n\nCathode \n \n\nElectrolyte \n\nAnode \n\n(c) cathode-supported \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 13 \n \n\nThe selection of cell supporting design must consider additional performance \n\nconstraints besides mechanical stabilization, such as: chemical stability and thermal expansion \n\ncompatibility between layers; long-term durability; issues regarding fabrication techniques; \n\nvoltage losses; and electrochemical catalysis\n[ 8, 13]\n\n. For instance, electrolyte resistance is a \n\nsignificant obstacle to further decrease the SOFC operating temperature, thus the \n\nmanufacturing of thinner electrolytes is of major interest. This can be accomplished by shifting \n\nthe function of mechanical stabilization from the electrolyte to one of the electrodes. In this \n\nconcept\n8\n, existing anode materials tend to be preferred because they exhibit better electrical \n\nconductivity. Thus, in this case, no appreciable ohmic losses occur when the electrode \n\nthickness is increased (see Fig. 1.8). Moreover,   /    cermet anodes also have good \n\nmechanical stability, allowing larger planar cells to be produced.  \n\n \nFigure 1.8: SEM image of an anode-supported cell (picture reproduced from [ 14]). \n\n \n\nA specific porous structure of thick substrate type is the so-called buffer-layer (also \n\nreferred to as \u201canode-barrier\u201d), which will be briefly presented in \u00a7\u00a71.3.4.5.  Here it is anywise \n\nappropriate to add that the use of this type of substrate also implies performance constraints, \n\nas already mentioned above for other types of supporting designs. Usually, the buffer-layer is a \n\nsubstrate with high porosity and adequate gas permeability, but the trade-off is that it has \n\nmuch lower effective electrical conductivity\n[ 15]\n\n. Therefore, in the particular case that the buffer-\n\nlayer is also used for mechanical stabilization, the cell should be classified as an insulator-\n\nsupported design. A final and equally important concept is that of functional layers and \n\ncomposite (functionally graded) electrodes\n[ 16]\n\n. The latter is often made by laying down several \n\nlayers, which allows a gradient of properties ranging from nearly pure electrolyte (e.g.,    ) at \n\nthe electrolyte surface to almost pure electrode composition at the interconnect contact (see \n\nFig. 1.9).  \n\n                                                      \n8\n Forschungszentrum J\u00fculich began working on this concept around 1993\n\n[14]\n. \n\nAnode support (Ni/YSZ) \n\nElectrolyte (YSZ) \n\nCathode (LSM/YSZ) \n\nAnode (Ni/YSZ) \n\n10 ?m \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 14 \n \n\nAlthough there are various different designs, SOFC composite electrodes often consist \n\nof a \u201csuperposition\u201d of at least two layers: (i) one constituted by a pure ion-conducting material; \n\nand the other constituted by the electro-catalyst/electron-conducting material (e.g.,     , \n\n      ).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9: illustrative example of a composite electrode (cathode, in this case) and its functional layers: current \n\ncollector layer with thickness  1; and cathode functional layer with thickness    (Figure by the author). \n \n\nFurthermore, each layer itself can be a mixture of one or more phases, with varying \n\ncomposition of each solid phase along the cell thickness (mixtures such as: pure ion-conductor \n\nwith a mixed electron-ion-conductor; or a pure ion-conductor with a pure electro-conductor; \n\nsee Fig. 1.10).  For instance, by layering the anode between two slightly different \n\ncompositions, one nearest the zirconia with less nickel, the other near the gas stream with \n\nmore nickel, can produce excellent anode properties, both from the catalytic (rapid reactions \n\nwith the fuel) and conduction (good conduction to the interconnect) points of view\n[ 13]\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.10: example of a cell with functionally graded electrodes and varying composition (Figure by the author). \n\n \n\nSOFC composite electrodes (e.g.,         for cathodes; and        for anodes) \n\nusually exhibits a superior performance compared to single phase electrodes, since the \n\nelectrochemically active zone is spread into the electrode\u2019s volume\n[ 17] \n\nin the former case. That \n\nis, there is a performance increase attributed to an improved contact with the bulk electrolyte \n\nas well as to an extended TPB in the composite structure\n[ 13]\n\n.

General Introduction and Background 15 \n \n\n \n\nBecause the analysis of SOFC materials itself is not within the scope of this work, only \n\nan essential overview is given about electrodes and electrolyte materials. The brief introduction \n\nthat follows should provide a reasonable background to support familiarization with main \n\nterminology and to present some key materials characteristics as well. Throughout this \n\ndissertation, however, a more in-depth examination of SOFC materials will be done promptly \n\nwhen deemed necessary for complete comprehension of a given topic. \n\n \n\nThe electrolyte is exposed to both oxidizing (air side) and reducing (fuel side) \n\natmospheres at high temperatures. Such grueling conditions require that, in order to attain \n\nsuccessful, long-term operation and maximum electrochemical efficiency, the electrolyte \n\nshould have the following characteristics\n[ 8]\n\n: (i) high ionic conductivity (electrolyte must be a \n\ngood ion conductor and ideally an electron insulator); (ii) dense structure (electrolyte must be \n\ngas tight); (iii) stability (the electrolyte when exposed to both air and fuel, at elevated \n\ntemperatures, must be chemically stable); and (iv) well-matched thermal expansion coefficient \n\n(in a composite material structure, the thermal expansion coefficient must match at the \n\nelectrolyte/electrode interface to prevent cracking of the joint on thermal changes). \n\nOften used electrolytes materials for SOFCs are nonstoichiometric (i.e., oxygen-\n\ndeficient) oxides\n[ 18]\n\n with low valent element (cations) substitutions, the latter also referred to as \n\nacceptor dopants, which create oxygen vacancies (disorder sites) through charge \n\ncompensation. Historically, SOFCs have been based on electrolytes of zirconia (    ) doped \n\nwith the addition of a small percentage of yttria (    ). Above the temperature of about 600\u00b0C, \n\nzirconia becomes a conductor of oxygen ions (   ), and typically the zirconia-based SOFC \n\noperates between 800 \u00b0C and 1000 \u00b0C. Yttrium-stabilized-     or     (e.g.,          1  1    or, \n\nequivalently,    ) is the most common electrolyte that satisfies the material requirements just \n\ndescribed, however there is a wealth of other possibilities, such as acceptor doped      and \n\nperovskite structure oxides\n[ 8]\n\n.  \n\nTypically, the amount of doping with yttria is of the order of 13-16% by weight (8-10% \n\nmol) to give fully stabilized cubic material\n[ 7]\n\n. The ability to conduct     ions is brought about by \n\nthe fluorite cubic crystal structure of zirconia in which some of the      ions are replaced with \n\n    ions (when this ion exchange occurs, a number of oxide-ion sites become vacant\n[ 7,8]\n\n).  \n\nThe ionic conductivity of     (          1 at 800\u00b0C;          1 at 1000 \u00b0C) is comparable with \n\nthat of liquid electrolytes. Although     shows the lowest ionic conductivity (see Fig. 1.11), it \n\nremains as one of the few materials that has been demonstrated to provide long-term stability \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 16 \n \n\nunder real operation conditions\n[ 8]\n\n. Different approaches have been attempted in order to apply \n\n    in the intermediate-temperature operation. The typical one is to decrease the thickness of \n\n    electrolyte and thus minimize the overall ohmic loss.

Most cathodes are now made from either electronically conducting \n\ncomposite oxides or mixed electron-conducting-ion-conducting (MIEC) ceramics. \n\nThe most common cathode material is the strontium-doped lanthanum manganite, e.g. \n\n(             )         (   ), which is often used in composite designs, such as in mixtures of \n\nYSZ and     (see Fig. 1.9).

General Introduction and Background 19 \n \n\nFuel processing may be defined as the conversion of the raw primary fuel, as delivered \n\nto a SOFC system, into the fuel gas that is actually required by the stack (anodes). At least \n\nfrom the point of view of technology feasibility, SOFCs can utilize a wide range of hydrocarbon \n\nfuels, provided that these are properly cleaned and reformed into \u201csimpler\u201d fuels such as H2 \n\nand CO\n[ 4]\n\n. Therefore, the main purpose of fuel processing is to convert readily available \n\nhydrocarbon fuels into H2-rich and/or CO-rich gas (both gases are at times referred to as \n\nreformate streams) that can be electrochemically oxidized at the fuel cell anode. The fastest \n\nelectrochemical reaction at the nickel anode is that of hydrogen gas, but other fuels can reac t \n\ndirectly with the anode, depending on catalyst composition\n[ 21]\n\n. For example, carbon monoxide \n\ncan also react on        but it requires a higher overvoltage than hydrogen\n[ 22]\n\n, meaning that \n\n   electrochemical oxidation rate is relatively slower when compared to that of   .  \n\nThe fuel may also require some level of purification because fuel impurities (e.g., sulfur) \n\nare a common source of damaging mechanism, which ultimately might lead to the total failure \n\nof a SOFC\n[ 4]\n\n. Sulfur is the most prevalent impurity and can be present in most fuels derived \n\nfrom fossil sources, either by nature or added as odorant. Even lower levels of sulfur (in the \n\norder of     ), such as those found in odorants used in natural gas for leak detection), are \n\ndamaging to SOFC nickel anodes\n[ 4]\n\n given that sulfur and sulfur-compounds are known to \n\nadsorb and cause a loss in the electrode performance\n[ 23]\n\n. There are two approaches to tackle \n\nthis problem: adding a sulfur absorber to the fuel processing unit (see Fig. 1.14); and/or using \n\nanode metals that are less likely to be negatively affected by sulfur. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAfter \nburner \n\nC\na\nth\n\no\nd\ne\n \n\nA\nn\no\nd\ne\n \n\nFuel Cell \n\nDesulphuriser \n\nGas \nTurbine \n\nNatural \ngas Air \n\nAlternator \n\nExhaust \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 20 \n \n\nThe requirements and complexity of the fuel processing step depends largely on both \n\nfuel cell type and raw fuel. The nickel content in the anode of SOFCs means that internal \n\nreforming reactions can be carried out directly (internally) in porous anodes, and this is to a \n\ngreat advantage in minimizing the overall system complexity and total costs\n[ 4]\n\n. The high \n\noperation temperature not only provides waste heat exhaust, but it also effectively activates \n\nthe processes of reforming in the presence of suitable catalysts (such as nickel-based \n\nmaterials). The electrochemical oxidation of fuels gives off excess heat that can be utilized by \n\nthe highly endothermic steam and/or dry reforming reactions simultaneously taking place, \n\nwhich makes internal on-cell reformation possible, precluding the need for external reformer \n\nand allowing chemical integration with the main products (e.g.,    /   ) originated from \n\nelectrochemical reactions. This possibility has led to various internal reforming concepts on the \n\naccount of SOFC high operating temperatur. In one of these concepts, fuel reforming occurs \n\nwhen steam is added to hydrocarbon fuel stream (typically at a ratio of 3 parts steam to 1 part \n\nfuel) in SOFCs with the so-called direct internal reforming or DIR design\n[ 4, 13]\n\n; or, alternatively, \n\nwhen using virtually dry fuels (without the need of adding steam to the inlet fuel stream) in \n\nSOFCs that operate with gradual catalytic reforming\n[ 24]\n\n.  \n\nUnfortunately, however, the main advantages of DIR-SOFCs can be completely offset \n\nby the occurrence of \u201canode coking\u201d (i.e., carbon deposition), which can render the SOFC \n\npermanently non-functional after short time of operation\n[ 25]\n\n. Thus, a major roadblock to long-\n\nterm stability of DIR-SOFCs operating on methane and otherhydrocarbon fuels is the anodic \n\ncarbon deposition. Nickel-based anodes have the propensity to coke\n[ 8]\n\n, that is, to become \n\ncoated (and blocked) with a carbon layer on reacting with dry fuels such as pure methane. \n\nFrom this point of view, nickel-based catalysts may not be a suitable choice for DIR \n\napplications, if care is not taken to ensure a proper fuel/steam ratio before the fuel mixture \n\nreaches the anode active layer. There is, however, an alternative cell design that tries to tackle \n\nsome of the stability limitations that are typical of standard   -cermets. In contrast to traditional \n\nSOFC designs, in which   -based anodes acts as the only effective catalyst for internal \n\nreforming, this alternative design suggests the use of a barrier-layer architecture. In other \n\nwords, \u201ca barrier\u201d is done by the addition of either a thin catalyst layer\n[ 24, 26, 27]\n\n or thick inert \n\nlayer\n[ 28]\n\n between the anode and fuel channel (see Fig. 1.15).  \n\nBoth chemically inert and catalytic anode barrier layers are found to offer advantages \n\nwhen compared to conventional techniques, because they permit a more complete reforming \n\nand deposit-free operation (i.e., they process the fuel and protect the anode) by enhancing \n\nstability and locally slowing catalytic endothermic reforming reactions. In terms of stability, the \n\nbarrier hinders the flux of fuel into the electro-catalytically active region and likewise hinders \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 21 \n \n\nthe flux of    /    from the anode to fuel channel.

General Introduction and Background 22 \n \n\n \n\nAlthough much of the modeling approaches that will be discussed in this work could be \n\nused with different SOFC configurations, the focus herein is on one specific design: button -\n\ntype SOFC\n[ 29, 30]\n\n with a normally impinging circular jet flow configuration in both air-side and \n\nfuel-side compartments (gas channels), as illustrated on figures 1.17 and 1.18. Single button-\n\ncells play a major role in the development and evaluation of new SOFC materials and PEN \n\narchitectures\n[ 13]\n\n. These single-cell tests are useful to determine the cell performance under \n\nideal conditions, where gold or platinum are often used to make excellent current contact with \n\nthe electrodes (though there still are contact issues that might severely bias the experimental \n\nreadout\n[ 29]\n\n). The primary purpose of button-cell testing is to provide a method of assessing the \n\neffects of changes in cell design, component materials, and fabrication processes.  \n\nWhile it is always desirable to obtain accurate results, the usual outcome of screening \n\ntests using button cells is comparative in nature.  In other words, many experimenters use \n\nbutton cell testing as a relative rather than absolute test method. By defining a reference \n\npolarization curve or impedance spectrum for well-defined materials and operating conditions, \n\nthe changes relative to the reference condition are determined and interpreted\n[ 30]\n\n.  However, \n\ndespite this seemingly simple comparison methodology, it is important to recognize that \n\nbroader implications can be inferred from button-cell results\n[ 13, 29]\n\n. According to Fig. 1.17, most \n\nbutton-cell tests are performed in temperature-controlled furnaces, where the \n\nanode/electrolyte/cathode (PEN) is held concentrically between other tubes, which are made \n\nof either glass or ceramic materials. \n\nTypically, PENs are small circular cells of one to five centimeters in diameter that are \n\nbounded to tubular fixtures. All these tubes must be sealed hermetically against the PEN disc \n\nbefore the assembly is positioned within the furnace. Reducing and oxidizing gases are \n\nsupplied to either side (anode and cathode sides, respectively) of the PEN via much thinner \n\ninner feeding tubes\n10\n\n. For example, in Fig. 1.17b a fuel mixture flows from top to bottom in the \n\nfuel channel at the top, and is transported into the pores of the anode-barrier. In the buffer-\n\nlayer and anode the fuel mixture undergo chemical reaction on catalyst surfaces and one or \n\nmore species, which can be either initially present or produced in situ, may then be \n\nelectrochemically oxidized on reaching the anode active layer near the dense electrolyte. For \n\neach experimental run, the porosity, particle sizes, pore sizes, and the chemical composition of \n\nelectrode layers may, in principle, all vary along the cell thickness in order to acquire different \n\ntypes of experimental information. \n\n                                                      \n10\n\n In button-cell experiments, the cathode side is usually exposed to air that may simply be the furnace air or it \nmay be supplied via a feed tube. The latter case is shown on figures 1.17 and 1.18. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ?

Stagnation flows represent a very important class of \n\nflow configurations\n[ 33]\n\n wherein the transport equations often reduce to a system of ordinary \n\ndifferential equations (ODEs) describing boundary-value problems. Some of these flows have \n\ngreat practical value in industrial applications, such as in chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) \n\nreactors\n[ 33]\n\n. They are also widely used in catalytic combustion research\n[ 34]\n\n.  \n\nStagnation flows may be seen as a particular case of normally impinging circular jets in \n\nconfined spaces and, depending on the problem\u2019s geometrical dimensions and fluid flow \n\nparameters, different flow similarity reductions (either complete or incomplete) are possible\n[ 35, \n\n36]\n. A peculiar feature of SFRs is that the phenomena under study usually take place within a \n\nthin viscous region adjacent to a solid surface, which usually plays a catalytic role. Thus, SFRs \n\nare often employed to study heterogeneous catalysis problems under \u201cideal conditions\u201d. The \n\nidealization aspect of SFRs refers to the condition that the processes occurring at the solid \n\nsurface should not be influenced (limited) by upstream conditions (the outer flow region). More \n\ngenerally, in SFRs the result of the interaction between the outer flow region and boundary-\n\nlayer is assumed to be well known (\u201ccontrolled and resolved\u201d), thus any effects stemming from \n\nthis interaction might be seamlessly separated from, for example, the intrinsic reactivity of \n\nsurface catalysis (see \u00a7\u00a74.10). \n\nThere is a large body of experimental data on SOFC button-cell experiments running on \n\nfuels such as   ,    ,       , and higher HCs. However, although the existing setups for \n\nbutton-cell testing share many common characteristics, different research groups follow \n\ndifferent practices in testing cells and reporting experimental data.

General Introduction and Background 25 \n \n\nwriting, there are still no strictly standardized single-cell testing procedures providing \n\nforethought and criteria for conducting such tests, though there were attempts in this direction\n[ \n\n37]\n. The careful consideration of what is necessary to successfully test button-cells can often \n\nbring increased awareness about otherwise \u201cinexplicable\u201d experimental results. Moreover, \n\nmany underpinning mathematical models that depict the behavior of PEN architectures are \n\nusually developed and validated with button-cell experiments. It is therefore of paramount \n\nimportance to understand, in an unambiguous manner, the influence of experimental setup \n\nand operating conditions on measured cell performance. Numerical investigation of cell \n\nperformance should ensure the use of physically consistent model parameters to explain the \n\nexperimental outcome. \n\nAs mentioned above, button-cell testing permits comparative appraisal based on \n\nchanges of design, materials, and operating conditions. In this regard, there is a certain degree \n\nof \u201cflexibility\u201d only insofar as the model parameters can be adjusted to fit experimental data. \n\nHowever, this flexibility can be elusive, especially if contentious conclusions arise from the \n\ncomparison between model predictions and experimental results. Such situation can indeed \n\noccur if, for instance: \n\n? If a given mathematical model (and its underlying assumptions) is unfit for the \n\npurpose of credibly describing the physical reality of the experiment. In this case, \n\nit is not uncommon the use of inconsistent parameters solely for the intent of \u201cbest \n\nfitting\u201d the experimental dataset, and as a way to compensate for other sources of \n\nerror (i.e., as in a false correction), thus disregarding the physical pertinence of \n\nthe model itself. \n \n\n? The test itself was not well thought out, meaning that \u201cmeaningless\u201d results can \n\nfollow from either improper testing procedures or wrong assumptions about the \n\nactual experimental conditions. Sometimes there is a nuance on how to \n\ndifferentiate between these factors. \n\n \nDue to either of the causes just mentioned above, conclusions tend to lessen in \n\npractical value and, ultimately, the objective comparison between model and experiment is \n\nimpaired. An examination concerning these aspects must be performed, including the scrutiny \n\nof different reactor models (e.g., plug-flow, finite-gap stagnation flow, and flow between parallel \n\ndiscs) and the evaluation of possible sources of experimental bias, such as seal leakage \n\nduring cell tests. It is important to mention that part of the works in the literature that will be \n\nreviewed in Chapter 4 has employed different experimental setups for the gas channel (planar \n\ncells with parallel flow, for example). In spite of that, the remarks made above about button-cell \n\ntesting remain valid in respect to the importance of understanding the influence of \n\nexperimental setup on the de facto measured cell performance.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 26 \n \n\n \n\nDominant forces that influence micro-scale components, such as the PEN in SOFC \n\nsystems, are peculiarly different from those that influence their conventional-scale \n\n(macroscopic) counterparts. This is because the size of a physical system bears a significant \n\ninfluence on the natural processes that dictate the behavior of that system, i.e. variance in \n\nscale might lead to sensible differences in transport mechanisms. For example, large-scale \n\nsystems are influenced by inertial effects to a greater extent than small-scale systems, while \n\nthe latter is influenced greatly by surface effects. In many scientific disciplines, this concept of \n\ninterrelating scales and physical phenomena is commonly called \u201cphysics of scaling laws\u201d \n[ 38]\n\n.  \n\nDuring the development stage of a mathematical model, an approach is usually \n\nspecialized toward particular phenomenon and scale. This screening strategy is largely due to \n\nthe need to rationalize the overall goal of modeling activities, when computational cost and \n\ntheoretical uncertainness must be both quantified and balanced (via trade-offs) in order to \n\naccurately and feasibly describe the critical processes responsible for SOFC performance. \n\nNonetheless, the simulation of SOFC systems is a problem that incorporates important \n\nfeatures from multiple physical scales\n[ 2]\n\n. Therefore, in principle, a number of different and \n\nsimultaneous physicochemical processes (\u201cmultiphysics\u2019\u201d) that take place over a wide range of \n\nspatio-temporal scales (\u201cmultiscale\u201d) have to be acknowledged. When a detailed \n\nunderstanding of the relevant processes at a given scale is required, one should refer to more \n\nspecialized models that treat the details of single parts of the SOFC (e.g., models specifically \n\ndeveloped and validated for the \u201cPEN or single-cell scale\u201d). Even so, electrode-level \n\nphenomena still entail a considerable challenge for traditional (\u201csingle-scale\u201d or monoscale) \n\nmodeling approaches, because transport and thermodynamic processes occurring in the PEN \n\nare also strongly, and often nonlinearly, coupled over various length and time scales\n[ 3]\n\n. \n\nFurthermore, this coupling effect can manifest itself as a dominant influence of the microscale \n\nphysical-chemistry over the macroscopic behavior of SOFC and, in this case, such intimate \n\ndegree of interdependence should not be undervalued. \n\nTo cope with the multiscale character of the problem at hand, the existing SOFC \n\nmodeling techniques (see Fig. 1.19) range from atomistic to system-scale applications\n[ 1, 2]\n\n, \n\nlikewise multiscale model methods\n[ 39]\n\n range from quantum to classical  (field)  mechanical \n\ntheories . For the most part, multiscale modeling intend to predict material properties and/or \n\nsystem behavior on one scale using information, e.g. models and/or experimental data, from \n\ndifferent scales\n[ 40]\n\n, a concept which is usually referred to as \u201cscale linking\u201d or \u201cscale bridging\u201d. \n\nAccording to Fig. 1.19, on each distinct scale, a specific modeling technique can be used to \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ?

Briefly, one may distinguish two main cases:  \n\ni. The phenomenon of interest is dominated by processes occurring on different \n\ncharacteristic scales. That is, the phenomenon presents substantial spatial and \n\ntime heterogeneity on these scales and, therefore, such heterogeneities must be \n\nevaluated by theoretical (\u201cmore detailed\u201d) models in order to produce useful \n\nsimulation results. In this case, therefore, multi-scale resolution is an intrinsic \n\nrequirement to assess the SOFC performance.[ 41, 42, 43] \n \n\n                                                      \n12\n\n Here one must bear in mind the distinction between definitions of continuum from mathematics ( e.g., continuum \nhypothesis, linear continuum, continuum theory of topology) and that from continuum mechanics\n\n[ 41]\n. \n\n \n13\n\n Strictly speaking, neither the FVM nor FME is tied to any specific scale restriction, when they are viewed as \npurely discretization schemes. Thus, these methods are not necessarily applied only to macroscale -continuum \nformulations of governing equations. For instance, the FVM has been used\n\n[ 42, 43]\n as the method for solving the \n\ndiscrete formulation of Lattice-Boltzmann Equation (LBE). However, the application of the traditional forms of FVM \nand FEM in complex geometries might be not suitable for multiphysics numerical simulations, such as in those \ngeometries resulting from the detailed (\u201cstructure-resolved\u201d) description of porous media on the nanoscopic or \nmesoscopic length scale. \n\nQuantum \nMechanics \n\n(QC) length \n\ntime \n\nA  nm ?m mm m \n\nfemtoseconds \n\npicoseconds \n\nnanoseconds \n\nmicroseconds \n\nmiliseconds \n\nseconds \n\nyears \n\nLattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM) \nMethod of Volume Averaging (MVA) \n\nMacroscale \n\n \n\nNanoscale \n\nKinetic \nMonte Carlo \n(KMC) \n\nMesoscale \n\nDirect \nMonte Carlo Simulation  \n(DMCS) \n\n \nUnit Process \n\nDesign \n\n \nContinuum Models \n\n \nMesoscale \n\nModels \n\nMolecular \nDynamics \n\n(MD) \n\nSystem \n\nlevel \n\nCell \n\nlevel \n\nElectrode \n\nlevel \n\nSurface and \n\nInterface \n\nlevel \n\nStack \n\nlevel \n\nFinite Volume Method (FVM) \nFinite Element Method (FEM) \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 28 \n \n\nii. The interest consists in predicting material properties or system behavior based \n\non the knowledge of more elementary processes and/or fundamental properties, \n\neven though physical scaling effects do not need to be accounted for explicitly to \n\nproduce useful results on the scale of interest. For example: one wishes to \n\ninvestigate what is the influence of the grain size distribution (i.e., a subscale \n\ninfluence) of an ionic phase on the effective conductivity of a given electrode \n\nmaterial. However, all that would be required to calculate this effective value on \n\nthe macroscale is the phase\u2019s temperature, through the use of a suitable single-\n\nscale (lumped parameter) model. Thus, in this case, subscale resolution is not \n\nmandatory to assess SOFC macroscale performance. No doubt this is simply a \n\nmatter of research convenience. \n\n \nIn both cases above, accounting for the interactions from multiple levels turns to be a \n\ncritical ability in understanding the phenomenology that one is particularly interested on and \n\nwhich is observed from some deliberately chosen scale. It should be manifest, however, that \n\nthere is an inherent level of subjectivity when deciding whether to use high-fidelity microscopic \n\nmodels or to apply coarse-graining of those models\n[ 40]\n\n. Depending on the overall goal of the \n\nnumerical simulation, in some situations one can apply \u201cone-dimensional\u201d or even \u201czero-\n\ndimensional\u201d models to complex problems and still succeed in their application, provided that \n\nenough lumped parameters are available \u201cto fit\u201d the experimental behavior. It must be equally \n\nevident that in this situation there is loss of information, lack of generality, and also possible \n\nphysical inconsistencies at the expense of simulation pragmatism. On the other hand, the \n\ncoarse-graining can deprive the model of its complex scale-to-scale interaction on which the \n\nmain physical-chemical behavior depends for a proper description.  In this case, the accuracy \n\nof lower-dimensional calculation models can become a fallacy. Moreover, these models often \n\nbecome strongly dependent on rather \u201crandom best fitting\u201d and \u201cbest guess\u201d averaging \n\nprocedures, with resulting parameters that are disproved of physical consistency.   \n\nMuch depends on the purpose of the simulation and what type of problem is being \n\ntackled. For example, the dynamic and predictive control modeling of SOFCs on a system-\n\nlevel\n[ 44]\n\n is computationally prohibitive, if detailed descriptions of all parts of the fuel cell are to \n\nbe included. Thus, rationalization of computational effort and accuracy requirements form the \n\nbasis of the modeling strategy. The decision-making often involves the selection of a \u201cfit for \n\npurpose\u201d modeling technique: a model should be reasonably accurate and detailed enough to \n\ncapture characteristics that are deemed important to the numerical study; on the other hand, \n\nthe selected model should, ideally, require a much lower computational effort than that \n\nrequired by atomistic-level models.   \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 29 \n \n\nOnce the superstructure of the modeling approach (i.e., its governing equations) has \n\nbeen established, a critical step is to define reliable and accurate constitutive equations (i.e., \n\nclosure relations) for the materials involved (e.g., gas species and porous solids). These \n\nrelations are usually expressed in terms of the various parameters appearing in governing \n\nequations (\u201cbalance laws\u201d) and their evaluation can be performed through theoretical \n\nconstitutive equations of material models, using experimentally fitted values, or both. The type \n\nand number of constitutive terms that will require prescription depends solely upon what \n\nmodeling approach has been selected. Thus, here one faces a subtle \"back and forth trade -\n\noff\", but an important one. \n\nIf one selects a model for which a \u201cmathematical closure\u201d relation is necessary, such \n\nrelation must be somehow known upfront to guarantee self-consistency of the chosen \n\nmodeling technique. Moreover, if this specific closure greatly affects the results as predicted by \n\nthe model, then it is of utmost importance to have a closure relation that can be reliably and \n\naccurately evaluated. If this is not possible, one should strive to identify another (more) \n\nappropriate modeling superstructure. Thus, ascertaining whether a property can or cannot be \n\nevaluated interferes in the screening process of modeling techniques. More often than not, the \n\nmore detailed the model the greater the number of properties that will need proper \n\nmathematical description. In general, the extent of ones knowledge about the properties of a \n\nsystem restrains the amount of details that is possible to accrue from numerical simulations. \n\nTransport and thermodynamic properties are a necessary part of physical models, \n\ninasmuch as characterizing the molecular transport in multicomponent-multiphase mixtures \n\nrequires, for example, the evaluation of viscosities and diffusion coefficients. The \n\ncharacterization of molecular transport should be underlined by the discussion about the \n\nthermodynamic formalism (i.e., constitutive relations) that actually supports the evaluation of \n\nthose material-related proprieties. That is, there should be some analysis on the adopted \n\nmacroscale mixture theory and whether or not heterogeneous systems\n[ 45]\n\n have been properly \n\nconsidered in this theory. However, these formalisms are often tacitly and uncritically adopted \n\nin the SOFC literature. This is an important topic, because a given thermodynamic theory \n\nmight not be consistent in the wide sense of a microscopic theory of processes that occur in \n\nsystems that are not in statistical equilibrium. In these situations, kinetic properties are more \n\nclosely related to the nature of microscopic interactions of a particular phenomenon\n[ 46]\n\n than to \n\nthat of the \u201caveraged\u201d macroscopic behavior. Nevertheless, considering what has been argued \n\nin \u00a7\u00a71.1, this type of discussion (\u201canalysis of general thermodynamic formalisms\u201d) is beyond \n\nthe scope of this work. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 30 \n \n\nFinally, it is worth to mention that in the case of closure relations that are based on \n\nexperimentally measured information, property data furnished by \u201cconventional\u201d (macroscale) \n\nmethods are integral values over some a priori characteristic time and length scales (inherent \n\nto the experimental technique used). That is, the available data already represent averaged \n\nvalues in some sense. This fact may or may not limit the usage of this experimental \n\ninformation in fine-scale models whose aim is to solve problems over significantly distinct time \n\nand length scales. In other words, there may be an intractable \u201dlumping effect\u201d that can render \n\nthe simulation results unreliable, if the intrinsic averaging of fine-scale models (when these are \n\nintegrated over the computational domain) does not lead to the same natural average of the \n\nexperimental test from which property data was obtained. \n\n \n\n \n\nAlthough this work addresses a specific problem (e.g., gas transport in SOFCs), its \n\ntheme belongs to a wide field of research, which is the modeling of transport processes in \n\nporous medium systems\n[ 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]\n\n. In this field, certain subject areas play a major \n\nrole, namely: (i) factors related to material (structure and properties) characterization of porous \n\ndomains; (ii) dynamics of fluids in the percolated voids of porous spaces, including \n\nmulticomponent physical kinetics and thermodynamics aspects; and (iii) the heterogeneous \n\n(metal-catalyzed) chemical-electrochemical reactions on pore-wall surface. The modeling of \n\ntransport processes within porous catalysts entails a multitude of problems, the majority of \n\nthem of severe complexity and still under intense debate in the literature\n[ 55, 56]\n\n. Most notably, \n\nthe theoretical limitations of the phenomenological modeling techniques commonly applied to \n\ndescribe the intrinsic multiscale nature of surface-catalyzed phenomena\n[ 55, 57]\n\n.  \n\nTo some extent, the turmoil and uncertainty found in the literature, concerning both the \n\nexperimental and theoretical aspects of transport phenomena in porous media, make \n\nimpossible to extract a theory of the comprehensiveness that is desired. Moreover, it is oft en \n\narduous to disentangle hard distinctions from elusive research findings, where the latter might \n\nbe merely an accurate measure of a prevailing bias\n[ 58]\n\n. In the specific case of this work, \n\nhowever, this is not a complete fair depiction of the state of affairs as this is not what \n\nessentially prevents one from obtaining a consistent mathematical framework. What one \n\nshould consider of great difficult is not the lack of satisfactory theories, but rather the \n\nwidespread ambiguities, misunderstandings, and confusion stemming from the derivation and \n\napplication of some of the existing (and not usually regarded as well-established) transport \n\nphenomena models. Confidence in the use of these models is probably undermined primarily \n\nwhen: (i) their physical assumptions are not properly acknowledged; (ii) their results are \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 31 \n \n\nclaimed more certain than they really are; and (iii) when they are assumed to have far-reaching \n\napplicability, when forcibly they have not. It is necessary therefore to recognize that the model \n\nshould be verified considering its real context of application. For example, the underlying \n\ntheory for evaluating the problem of multicomponent diffusion in the free (unconstrained or \n\n\u201cbulk\u201d) gas volume can be dramatically different when wall effects are (or should be) taken \n\nunder consideration, as it is the case for diffusional transport in tight porous media. Similar \n\nstatements can be drawn on the basis of the influences from chemical reactions, \n\nadsorption/desorption, viscous shear, and gas rarefaction on diffusion mechanisms. To rightly \n\nsolve the problem of multicomponent transport, a consistent and all-encompassing (extended) \n\nthermodynamic basis is needful to derive phenomenological equations that are able to capture \n\nthe complexities of multicomponent transport\n[ 59, 60, 61]\n\n. \n\nThere is a long-time state of confusion in the area of multicomponent transport in \n\ncapillaries and pores, when marcoscale phenomenological frameworks are applied. Many \n\nmodels and theories have been devised based on a large number of simple approximations, \n\nsuch as the \u201cBosanquet formula\u201d\n[ 62]\n\n, for which it was stated that the linear momentum \n\nconservation was, allegedly, the basis for the derivations. However, nowhere the fluid shear \n\nappeared. Present mass transport theories often used by chemical engineers, stemming from \n\nthe statistical-mechanics developments of Chapman\u2013Enskog, Zhdanov\u2013Kagan\u2013Sazykin, and \n\nBearman\u2013Kirkwood apply only to systems with low shear (e.g., see \u00a7\u00a73.6). These theories are \n\nnot able to satisfactorily describe gaseous counter-diffusion in small pores as well. The linear \n\nirreversible thermodynamics theory by de Groot\u2013Mazur and Hirschfelder\u2013Curtiss\u2013Bird also \n\ndemonstrates several shortcomings. Some authors also developed models based on forceful \n\nerroneous steps in an attempt to repair the faults of their starting equation, e.g., as it is the \n\ncase of the well-known Dusty Gas Model\n[ 63, 50]\n\n.  \n\nIt is clear, therefore, that a rigorous understanding of the complete set of wall-\n\nconstrained governing equations of gas transport would be crucial to analyze the problems \n\naddressed in this dissertation. For instance, it seems of utmost importance the need for a \n\nbetter and more clearly identifiable justification for the origin of the pressure gradient terms in \n\nthe macroscale Maxwell-Stefan formalism\n[ 64, 65]\n\n. To fail in doing so can lead to \u201cunnoticed \n\nconsequences\u201d that are as formidable as the lack of mass conservation, as it is, in fact, the \n\ncase of some models found in the SOFC literature\n[ 66]\n\n. Unfortunately, there is a prevailing trend \n\nin the development of purely macroscopic phenomenologies that considers that mathematical \n\nformalisms, which are needed to describe the mixed-gas transport behavior, are much the \n\nsame for all types of porous media. Such generalization cannot hold on well-founded \n\nphysicochemical principles, especially due to the interplay of both multiscale and multiphysics \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 32 \n \n\noccurring in these systems. Inherent limitations of the linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics, \n\non which many phenomenological frameworks are based, have greatly contributed to such \n\nmisconceptions. The apparent absence of due criticism of such models in the literature seems \n\nto amount to acceptance but the relevant microscopic characteristics of interrelated transport \n\nphenomena (e.g., mass transfer, wall effects, chemical reactions) can surely impact the \n\nveracity of these models at the macroscopic continuum.  \n\nAn analysis of mass transport should be performed to rule out inconsistencies or, which \n\nis the same, to establish a well-defined mathematical description of the transport phenomena \n\nthat could significantly affect critical physicochemical processes. Mass transport constitutes \n\none of the \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d (see Fig. 1.16) that needs to be analyzed in its particularities and \n\nthen, subsequently, in its interactions with other scientific disciplines (see Fig. 1.20 and Fig. \n\n1.21). It seems reasonably logical that specific inaccuracies from one block can propagate to \n\nthe others and, depending on the number and relative influence of such \u201cinconsistencies\u201d, the \n\nresulting variants of \u201cerror of judgment\u201d can become baffling. In other words, the fact that many \n\nsources of error can have the same \u201cintractable weight\u201d can render the overall analysis \n\nincredible. Thus, when trying to make a sizeable evaluation of potential inconsistencies one \n\nexpects to lend credence to conclusions of this work and make them theoretically tractable.  \n\nAlthough the focus of this work is to describe transport processes taking place in the \n\ngas-phase (\u201cmulticomponent gas flow in SOFC porous layers\u201d), it would be impossible to have \n\na well-posed physical problem without also examining, to some extent, aspects related to \n\nelectrochemical reactions and charge transport. Even so, \u201cfor the sake of feasibility\u201d and not to \n\noverwhelm this work with endless accounts of sub models, these other aspects will be treated \n\nas \u201cblack-boxes\u201d as much as possible. The specific mathematical form accounting the \n\ninteractions between gas-phase transport and electrochemical reactions (interfacial \n\nphenomena) depends on the coarse-graining of the models considered. Regardless of the \n\nscale of description, interfacial phenomena always will be represented in some form of \n\nmathematical abstraction (local microscale balances, boundary conditions, \u201cpseudo-\n\nheterogeneous\u201d volumetric source terms, and so forth). These interface entities, whichever \n\ntheir explicit from are, will always have relevant impact on the modeling of gas-phase \n\ntransport. However, no in-depth analysis will be made about them in this work, which would \n\ninclude the known limitations of the mean-field approximation when it is used to describe \n\nnanoscale-driven heterogeneous catalysis. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 ?

General Introduction and Background 34 \n \n\n \n\nEven though the electrochemistry is the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of any fuel cell device\n[ 67, 68]\n\n, it \n\nwas intentionally decided to not pursue a thorough review of electrochemical modeling in this \n\nwork, and thus avoiding any rigorous or extended presentation about the fundamental \n\nconcepts of electrochemical engineering. The reason being that such task would require \n\ntremendous effort and thus consume much time that could be otherwise spent on the \n\ncornerstone issues that this dissertation really aims to address, namely: mass and momentum \n\ntransport modeling in the gas-phase.  To clarify further about this scope delimitation, here \n\nfollows a brief reasoning. \n\nA number of electrochemical processes (e.g., charge transport, electrochemical \n\nkinetics, and thermal effects in non-isothermal systems) has an additional \u201cencumbrance\u201d \n\nwhen they are compared to other research topics considered in this work. Several fundamental \n\naspects of SOFC operation still involve not very well understood physicochemical phenomena, \n\nthus many questions remain on the exact electrochemistry theory that could describe such \n\naspects. In other words, there is no unarguable consensus on the mechanisms and \n\nphenomenology underlying the design of these electrochemical systems. For instance, charge \n\ntransfer kinetics remains as one of the least understood aspects of the electrochemistry\n[ 69, 67, \n\n13, 70, 71, 72]\n of solid state devices. In this way, the attempt of pursuing fully credible SOFC \n\nmodels at various levels of detail, from continuum-level electrochemistry approach (aimed at \n\nmacroscopic simulations) to \u201cmicroscale\u201d studies using structured-resolved/molecular-level \n\napproaches, seems unpractical at the present time. Therefore, considering the scope \n\nlimitations of the present work and the available research knowledge, the author opted to \n\ndedicate efforts to some key aspects of SOFC modeling, which are, on some level, related to \n\nconcentration polarization processes. \n\n\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1 6, 17, 18 , 19, 20, 2 1, 22, 23 , 24, 25, 2 6, 27, 2 8, 29, 30, 31, 32, 3 3, 34, 35 , 36, 37, 3 8, 39, 40 ,  41, 42, 4 3, 44, 45, 46, 47, 4 8, 49, 50 , 51, 52, 5 3, 54, 5 5, 56,  57, 5 8, 59, 60 , 61, 62, 6 3, 64, 6 5, 66, 67, 68, 69, 7 0, 71, 72  \n\n \n\nAt this point it is worth to clarify the reasons for including a small and yet relevant \n\nexcerpt related to the \u201cblack-box\u201d thermodynamics of a fuel cell (see Fig. 1.2a). As will be \n\nmade clear latter on, many of the mathematical models used to evaluate the so-called \n\n\u201cconcentration-induced losses\u201d are based on thermostatics considerations. Even though these \n\nmodels may take a further Gibbsian approach (i.e., in the sense that there is a more detailed \n\nphysicochemical look inside the \u201cblack-box\u201d thermodynamic system), it should remain apparent \n\nthat there is an underlying classical (global) equilibrium thermodynamics framework linking \n\nsome of the terms/relations that appear in such simplified models. In other words, one must \n\nemphasize that the derivation of these terms/relations implies, at least at their natural origin, a \n\nglobal state of exact balance for the potentials, or driving forces, within the macroscopic \n\nsystem. Thus, any \u201cextrapolation\u201d of such terms/relations, when used \u201cunnaturally\u201d in a local \n\nform of balance laws (now tacitly considering the state of the system to be non-uniform-locally-\n\nvarying in presence of dissipative thermodynamic fluxes), must be duly scrutinized at the \n\npertinent time.  \n\nThe following discussions are restricted to electrodes in equilibrium with both the \n\nelectrolyte phase and adjacent gas phase. In this phase equilibria, the cell potential can be \n\nexpressed in terms of the electrochemical potential of chemical species present on the \n\nelectrode surface and also in the gas that fills the voids of porous structures\n[ 67]\n\n. The condition \n\nof phase equilibrium precludes the passage of anything but an infinitesimal electric current. \n\nMoreover, it is tacitly assumed the inexistence of other spontaneous chemical reactions that do \n\nnot require a net current to occur. Equilibrium does also imply macroscopic homogeneity in a \n\ngiven phase, in the sense that local migrational equilibrium\n[ 73]\n\n does not take place anywhere \n\nwithin that phase.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 36 \n \n\n \n\nFor illustrative purposes, consider the basic (global) electrochemical reaction for the \n\narchetype hydrogen/oxygen SOFC: \n\n               \n \n\n \n                                   (2.1) \n\n \n\nThe Gibbs energy is a relevant quantity in the case of fuel cells (or any electrochemical \n\ndevice for that matter), for which it may be defined as the \u201cenergy available to do useful \n\nexternal work, but neglecting any work done by changes in pressure or volume\u201d\n[ 4]\n\n. In this case, \n\nthe \u201cuseful work\u201d involves moving electrons round an external circuit and any work done by \n\nchange in volume/pressure between the input and output is not harnessed by the fuel cell \n\nitself. In other words, Gibbs energy is a quantity that can be directly associated with the \n\nelectrochemical energy conversion in a SOFC. Thus, considering both reactants and products \n\nunder the same constant   and  , one can express reaction (2.1)  as: \n\n                    |     (  |   \n \n\n \n   |  ) (2.2) \n\n \n\nIn general, the Gibbs energy of formation is a function of temperate and state (liquid or \n\ngas), and, in the specific case of a fuel cell, its value is negative (     ), meaning that \n\nenergy is released in the transformation given by reaction (2.1). If there are \u201cno additional \n\nlosses\u201d in the fuel cell (i.e., the process is reversible and the entropy change is only due to a \n\nreversible chemical reaction to create new water molecules), then all the Gibbs energy can be \n\nconverted into electrical energy. \n\nThe basic operation of a SOFC was depicted in Chapter 1, wherein it was shown that, \n\nfor a pure hydrogen-fueled cell, two electrons pass round the external circuit for each water \n\nmolecule produced and for each molecule of hydrogen consumed. Thus, for one mole of \n\nhydrogen used, 2   electrons pass round the external circuit. If  \n  is the charge on one \n\nelectron, then the total charge flow is: \n\n      \n      [        ] (2.3) \n\n \n\nWhere   is the Faraday constant (                ).  If   is the fuel cell voltage, then the \n\nreversible electrical work done moving this charge round the circuit is \n\n                     ?(        )           [      ] (2.4) \n\n \n\nWhere    is the charge being moved (and on which coulombic forces act);   is the charge \n\ndisplacement;   is the electrostatic potential (voltage) field calculated at some at some point  ; \n\nIf the process is reversible, this electrical work will be equal to the Gibbs energy released    . \n\nThus\n[ 4]\n\n,  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ?

This is the voltage drop between the anode and the cathode under open-\n\ncircuit conditions (i.e., under zero net current condition), with the electrochemical potential of \n\noxide ions equilibrated through the oxide-ion conducting electrolyte layer. Equation (2.5), \n\nderived for the reversible open-circuit voltage (OCV) of a hydrogen/oxygen SOFC, can be \n\napplied to other reactions, by generalizing it to any number    of electrons per mole of fuel, \n\n     \n    \n\n    \n (2.6) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe way to define the efficiency of fuel cell devices is not unique. Thus, statements \n\nsuch as \u201cthe maximum possible efficiency\u201d of a fuel cell can mean different things, depending \n\non the different constraints that are imposed to a given engineering problem. For instance, if \n\nthere were no irreversibilities then all Gibbs energy would be converted into electrical energy \n\nand, if the reference is taken to be the Gibbs energy itself, the efficiency could be said to be \n\n100%.  Evidently, this is not a helpful definition for the efficiency when only considering \n\nreversible transformations. Since fuel cells use feed materials that are also commonly burnt to \n\nrelease their energy (e.g., as in combustion-based processes), and to get a good comparison \n\nwith these other fuel-using systems, the efficiency of the fuel cell is often defined as\n[ 4, 8, 68]\n\n  \n\n                                           \n\n    \n (2.7) \n\n \n\nWhere     is the heat that would be released by burning the fuel. More precisely, in this case, \n\nit is the change in the enthalpy of the electrochemical reaction. However, even this definition is \n\nnot free of ambiguities, as there are two different values that can be attributed to    , the \n\ndifference being the enthalpy of vaporization of water, that is, whether the product water was \n\nconsidered to be condensed back to liquid or not. Thus an efficiency value should mention \n\nwhether it relates to the higher heating value (HHV) or lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel. \n\nBecause the SOFC operates at high temperatures (and at moderated to low operating \n\npressures, i.e.        ), the water is assumed to be in gas phase. \n\nAll in all, based on the above definition one can see that there is a limit to the cell \n\nefficiency, even if the maximum electrical energy available is equal to the change in Gibbs \n\nenergy, in this case \n\n     \n   \n\n   \n (2.8) \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ?

Thus, the \u201creal\u201d cell efficiency is lower than that calculated by Eq. (2.11). Nonetheless, \n\nthis equation serves the purpose of making it explicit that fuel cell efficiency is related to both \n\nthe reversible (    ) and operating (     ) voltages. Therefore, the mathematical models that \n\nevaluate \u201cconcentration-induced losses\u201d (or other types of losses), and their respective impact \n\non the reduction of the cell operating voltage, are in fact trying to assess some aspect related \n\nto SOFC operating efficiency. \n\n \n\n \n\nAs noted before, changes in Gibbs energy can vary with temperature, pressure, \n\nconcentration of chemical species, and also with electrical state properties. Particularly, the \n\nchange in the Gibbs energy of reaction (2.1), for a constant temperature process, may be \n\nexpressed using the activity of reactants and products\n[ 67] \n\n            \n           (\n\n        \n  ?\n\n    \n) (2.12) \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ?

Equation (2.12) can be used to calculate     , by substituting it into Eq. (2.5): \n\n      \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  (\n\n        \n  ?\n\n    \n) (2.13) \n\n \n\nwhere    is EMF at the reference state.

The EMF calculated \n\nfrom such equations is also known as the \u201cNernst voltage\u201d and it is the reversible cell voltage \n\nthat would exist at a given temperature, pressure, and species concentrations.   \n\nOne may further manipulate Eq. (2.13) to get the explicit effects of species \n\nconcentrations and system pressure. For example, if it is assumed that all the gas species \n\nbehave as an ideal gas (which can be generally considered as a reasonable approximation, for \n\nthe typical case of a SOFC operating at 1000    and 0.1    ), then one can write\n[ 74]\n\n: \n\n    \n   \n  \n\n     \n \n\n  \n      \n\n   \n  \n\n     \n \n\n  \n       \n\n    \n\n  \n      \n\n \n\n  \n (2.14) \n\n \n\n      \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  [\n\n(     ? ) (     ? )\n  ?\n\n \n\n(      ? ) \n]     \n\n  \n\n  \n  (\n\n        \n  ?\n\n    \n)  \n\n  \n\n  \n  (\n\n \n\n  \n) (2.15) \n\n \n\nThe Nernst equation (2.15) shows how the EMF of a fuel cell is related to the system \n\npressure according to the term       ?       ?  . Thus, if the total pressure changes from an \n\nequilibrium state with a pressure    to other with a pressure   , with everything else held \n\nconstant, Eq.

(2.16) is a specific result of \n\nconsidering the reaction (2.1), oxidation of pure hydrogen with pure oxygen, for which the \n\nvolumes of products are smaller than the cumulative volume of reactants. This may not be so \n\nin general, as in the case of the oxidation of methane, for which the cumulative volume of \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 40 \n \n\nreactants and products is the same (i.e., there is no net change of volume; see also \u00a7\u00a73.4.2). \n\nThus, for this reaction there is theoretically no change in the cell reversible voltage caused by \n\nthe system thermodynamic pressure. This dependence on volume change (   ) can be easily \n\nseen by differentiating Eq. (2.6) with respect to pressure, under a constant temperature: \n\n(\n     \n\n  \n)\n \n\n       (\n     \n  \n\n)\n \n\n                (\n     \n  \n\n)\n \n\n  \n       \n\n    \n  (2.17) \n\n \n\nOne of the main simplifying assumptions used in this work is that cell layers (PEN) can \n\nbe considered spatially isothermal. Therefore, analyses such as the temperature dependence \n\nof      would be beyond the scope of this dissertation. Nevertheless, it is convenient to make \n\none remark about this topic. A significant number of works by different researchers who have \n\nconsidered non-isothermal cases, by solving additional energy balances and heat transport \n\nequations, misprized the importance of the dependence of      on local temperature. This is \n\nprobably because there is in the literature an ingrained assumption that      does not depend \n\n(or depends negligibly) on temperature\n[4,7,8,12,67,68]\n\n.  \n\nNotwithstanding such assumption is ubiquitous in the literature, it appears to be little \n\ndiscussion to confirm, experimentally, its generality when using it coupled to local property \n\nbalances (i.e., under non-equilibrium conditions). The habitual rationale\n[67, 68]\n\n to \u201cprove\u201d that \n\n     does not depend on temperature is to start from the Gibbs energy equation, locally \n\nassuming constant pressure and constant mole number for each and all chemical species (as \n\nin a \u201cclosed system\u201d). Then, under these assumptions, the dependence of         on \n\ntemperature is disregarded for practical purposes. Nonetheless, the reference state   should \n\nbe selected with criterion (not too far from the cell average operating temperature). A \n\nsomewhat more complete (still approximate) expression than Eq. (2.13) can be given as\n[67]\n\n: \n\n      \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n   \n        \n\n  \n\n   \n   (\n\n?           \n  \n\n \n\n?  \n          \n\n  \n \n\n) (2.18) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe theoretical value of the open circuit voltage (i.e., at the condition of zero net current \n\ndensity) is given by Eq. (2.6). However, when useful current is drawn from the fuel cell, it is \n\nfound that the actual voltage is often considerably less than this value\n[ 8, 13, 68]\n\n. In the Fig. 2.1 \n\nbelow, a typical\n1\n plot of cell voltage against current density (\u201c         curve\u201d) is shown and a \n\nnumber of characteristics, affecting the fuel cell performance, should be noticed: \n\n                                                      \n1\n This chart is more of pedagogical value than it is typical.

Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 42 \n \n\nAs already pointed out,       can be seen as a measure of SOFC efficiency. Thus \n\nmaintaining a minimum threshold for the cell voltage, even under high current loads, is critical \n\nto the successful deployment of SOFC technology. However, due to limitations of the existing \n\ntechnology, it is difficult to achieve high electric power density. Understanding these limitations \n\nstill represents a formidable effort in the research and development of SOFCs\n[ 13, 14, 70]\n\n. The \n\ndifference between the voltage one would expect from a fuel cell operating ideally (reversibly) \n\nand the actual voltage is what entails the discussion that will follow. More specifically, that \n\ndifference rooted in the \u201climitations of mass transport\u201d, which is the main concern that drove \n\nthis research work. The terminology used in the literature to refer to the causes of such \n\ndifference (voltage drop) varies. However, herein it will be referred to as \u201closses\u201d, \n\n\u201cpolarizations\u201d, or more generally as \u201cirreversibilities\u201d. At times it may be also referred to as \n\n\u201covervoltage\u201d, but this term when employed will refer only to those local voltage differences \n\nstemming from interfacial phenomena at the TPB of an electrode. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe characteristic shape of the cell i       curve (see figures 2.1 and 2.2) results from \n\nnon-equilibrium (irreversible) processes taking place within the SOFC. There are three major \n\nlosses that are usually recognized as dominant polarizations\n[ 76, 4, 8, 68]\n\n, and one minor loss that, \n\nhowsoever small, will be listed here for the sake of completeness (this \u201cminor loss\u201d is \n\nsometimes not included in the list of electrode polarizations). These losses will be outlined just \n\nbriefly in the following. \u201cConcentration-induced losses\u201d will be considered in more detail in \n\nChapter 3; other losses will be just summarized to further the understanding of their mutual \n\ninteraction, but no in-depth discussions will be presented. They are not within the scope of this \n\nwork, which intends to be limited to the critical analysis of phenomena related to mass transfer.  \n\n1. Activation polarization/losses: electrode reactions involve charge (electron) \n\ntransfer as a fundamental step, through which a neutral species is converted into \n\nan ion, and vice versa. The net current density is proportional to the rate of \n\nelectrochemical reactions and associated with this reaction rate there is a loss in \n\nvoltage, called activation polarization\n2\n or overvoltage (    ). This \u201cvoltage drop\u201d is \n\ncaused by the relative slowness of reactions taking place on the surface of \n\nelectrodes\n[ 76]\n\n, wherein a fraction of the \u201cavailable voltage\u201d (    ) is lost in driving \n\nthe reaction that transfers electrons to or from electrodes. Charge transfer is a \n\nmulti-step process, usually comprising several parallel reactions pathways, \n\nincluding, but not limited to: charge transfer reaction at or near the TPB; surface \n\ndiffusion; surface physisorption; and competitive chemisorption. The reaction \n\nmechanism describing such multiplicity of pathways is material and \n\nmicrostructure-dependent, i.e. electrode processes and micromorphology are \n\n                                                      \n2\n  Terminology seems to be related to the thermally-activated nature of the reaction involved\n\n[ 13]\n. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 43 \n \n\nclosely interrelated. Thus, in practical terms, it is not feasible to propose a single, \n\ngeneral reaction mechanism for neither cathodic (oxygen reduction) nor anodic \n\n(fuel oxidation) half-cell reactions. Moreover, it is often difficult to select a single \n\nrate-determining step (if existent, that is) and thus it is common practice in the \n\nliterature to describe the overall process (\u201crate law\u201d) using a phenomenological \n\ntreatment (phenomenological electrode kinetics). An example of such approach is \n\nthe use of phenomenological equations such as Butler-Volmer equation, Tafel \n\nequation, and the like. \n\n \n\n2. Ohmic polarization/losses: with the exception of superconductors, matter will most \n\ncertainly offer resistance to the motion of electrical charges. Ohmic polarization \n\n(    ) is the voltage drop due to the resistance to the flow of electric charges \n\nthrough the materials of electrodes and the various electronic interconnections of \n\na SOFC; it also accounts for the resistance to the flow of oxide ions through the \n\nelectrolyte\n3\n. In the common case, when a linear behavior between voltage drop \n\nand current density is assumed, this polarization can be described by Ohm\u2019s law \n\nand for this reason it is often called Ohmic loss. Such polarization is also referred \n\nto as resistive loss, a more general denotation, not restricted to Ohmic behavior. \n\nResistive losses can be evaluated by material constitutive relations, in which \n\nspecific material properties, such as the resistivity, govern the response of cell \n\nvoltage to the passage of a finite current. Therefore, the transport of oxide ions \n\nthrough the solid electrolyte is said to be governed by its ionic resistivity; and the \n\ntransport of electrons (or electron holes) through the electrodes is governed by \n\nelectronic resistivities\n4\n. In SOFCs, the major contribution to      is usually from \n\nthe electrolyte phase, since its ionic resistivity is fairly greater than the electronic \n\nresistivities of cathode, anode, and interconnections. Such contribution can be \n\nquite large in the case of thick electrolyte-supported cells.  However, it is usually \n\nsmaller in electrode-supported cells, when thin electrolytes are employed\n[ 13]\n\n. \n \n\n3. Concentration polarization/losses: at (or near) the anode/electrolyte interface, \n\nelectroactive fuel species (e.g.,    and/or   ) must be present to form the \n\nrespective products (e.g.,     and/or    ) through an electrochemical oxidation \n\nreaction. Meanwhile, at (or near) the cathode/electrolyte interface, electroactive \n\noxidant species (  ) must be present to form the respective products ( \n  ) \n\nthrough an electrochemical reduction reaction. Therefore, the transport (and in \n\nsitu generation, when this is also the case) of fuel and oxidant within SOFC layers \n\nmust be consistent with the net electric current flowing through the cell. In other \n\nwords, electroactive species are adjusted through charge and mass \u201cbalance \n\nlaws\u201d, subjected to additional internal and external system constraints. The \n\nknowledge of how these species reach the electrode/electrolyte interface (i.e., \n\nTPBs) informs us about what \u201cphysicochemical resistances\u201d must be overcome, at \n\na given current density value. These resistances are reflected as an overall \n\n                                                      \n3\n Or also through the electrode, when this electrode is a mixed ionic\u2013electronic conductor (MIEC).  \n\n \n4\n In a homogenized macroscale description, resistivities should be corrected for the effective medium parameters \n\n(e.g., porosity, tortuosity), and also for the possible existence of secondary contact-insulating phases. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 44 \n \n\n\u201cvoltage loss\u201d known as concentration polarization (     ). Because an \u201cadverse \n\nconcentration\u201d is the result of the \u201cfailure to transport\u201d sufficient electroactive \n\nspecies to/from the TPB region, this type of loss has been also termed as a mass \n\ntransport loss (see further discussion in Chapter 3). \n \n\n4. Electronic Leakage (parasitic losses): an ideal electrolyte should only transport \n\nionic charges (ions) through the cell.  However, this condition is often difficult to \n\nsatisfy completely in practice and a certain amount of electron conduction through \n\nthe electrolyte phase (\u201celectronic leakage current\u201d) is possible to occur\n[ 8]\n\n. The \n\nelectrical conduction in the electrolyte, though mainly carried by oxide ions, can \n\nhave a small but yet deleterious contribution from electrons. This effect have a \n\nmarked effect on the OCV, which is reduced by an amount      , depending upon \n\nthe electrolyte material, operating temperature, and oxygen partial pressure (   ) \n\nprofile through de cell\n[ 8]\n\n. This voltage drop should be more acute when there is a \n\nvery low oxygen partial pressure at the electrolyte/anode interface\n[ 8]\n\n. This effect is \n\nusually not important in modern SOFC electrolyte materials and thus it is often \n\ndisregarded in most modeling studies (as will be seen in Chapter 4). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.2: schematic-only i      curve. The voltage is a decreasing function of current density due to \nunavoidable losses (polarizations). The more electric current that is drawn from the cell, the greater these losses \nare. Each of these losses can be associated with some underlying non-equilibrium process.

Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 45 \n \n\n \n\nFrom a mathematical modeling perspective, it is convenient to formulate an equation \n\nthat would bring together all the previously mentioned irreversibilities (    ,      ,      ,      ) \n\nand relate them with the actual cell voltage (     ). This equation could be used, for instance, \n\nfor either calculating the cell voltage or to distinguish between losses. However, such equation \n\nrequires, for its formulation, some degree of arbitrariness on how to define each of the \n\nirreversibilities separately, because polarization regions may (and often do) overlap, and thus \n\nthey cannot be separated in a strict sense. \n\nTwo main assumptions are made to support the formulation of this equation: (i) that a \n\ncontinuum description can be applied on the electrode-level; and (ii) the presumed additivity of \n\n\u201cvoltage losses\u201d. Although the additivty property assumption could be proved for systems \n\nunder thermodynamic equilibrium, this is not so for those under non-equilibrium conditions\n[ 77, \n\n78]\n. The last statement is surely ambiguous, as these voltage losses can only exist under non-\n\nequilibrium conditions. The usual workaround in the literature, to deal with this \u201cteleological \n\nhindrance\u201d, is to invoke the local equilibrium postulate\n[ 79, 80]\n\n. In this work, this assumption is \n\ntaken as a valid precept. Nevertheless, the point here is to emphasize that, although \n\nempirically correct, the yet-to-be-proposed equation should be considered already in a \n\nsimplified form to the detriment of its usefulness and practicality. \n\nAt zero net current, SOFC electrodes should provide (theoretically) the thermodynamic \n\nor reversible voltage (          ). The connection of a load, thereby closing the electrical \n\ncircuit, should induce a net current density ( ) in the SOFC and reduce       by the overall \n\nvalue of voltage losses,               . Thus the current drawn from the cell \u201ccosts\u201d some \n\npotential and the thermodynamically predicted voltage (    ) may be viewed as the \u201ccapital\u201d at \n\none\u2019s disposal\n[ 12]\n\n. \n\n                        (2.19) \n\n \n\nEquation (2.19) is assumed to be valid at steady-state condition, at a given space coordinate. \n\nMoreover, in Eq. (2.19) the Nernst voltage      is assumed not to be a function of  .  This \n\nassumption is valid if, for instance, the mass transport rates of fuel and oxidant are sufficiently \n\nhigh so that species concentrations in gas channels (or at other adequate reference condition) \n\nare invariant with respect to current density. Otherwise,       must be treated as a function of  :  \n\n                           (2.20) \n\n \n\nThus, the difference                     may be understood as a measure of the change in \n\nthe reference composition of gas-phase (at constant   and  ), due to a finite change    in the \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ?

As it will be explained further below, the correct definition of       and       depends \n\non where one choses the \u201creference gas concentration\u201d to be located at. For instance, either at \n\nthe bulk of gas channels (    \n    ) or at the percolated TPB regions (    \n\n   ). Equation (2.20) \n\nsuggests that one may calculate the actual cell voltage output, starting with the thermodynamic \n\npredicted voltage and then subtracting out all the losses (voltage drops): \n\n                                  (2.21) \n\n \n\nEquation (2.21) sets a convenient way to depict the combined effects from the major \n\nphenomena that affect SOFC power throughput. For this reason, this equation has been used \n\nin the literature as a baseline for a wide spectrum of modeling techniques: from microscopic to \n\nmacroscopic scale models; from phenomenological differential forms, to algebraic \n\nexperimentally-fitted engineering forms (e.g., empirical distributed-parameter models). \n\nTherefore, both the general form of Eq. (2.21) and specific expressions (submodels) for the \n\ndifferent irreversibilities vary widely, depending on the modeling approach\n[ 1, 2, 72, 81]\n\n. \n\nDeceptively simple in appearance, this equation can \u201cencapsulate\u201d quite sophisticated models \n\nto calculate each type of polarization, thus supporting complex numerical simulations of \n\nSOFCs (see Chapter 4). Some additional remarks about Eq. (2.21): \n\n? This equation, even when applied with seemingly basic fuel cell submodels, has \n\nbeen found to give good fit with the results of real SOFCs, based on evidence \n\nderived from experiments\n[ 4, 8]\n\n. \n  \n? The question of which processes contribute to      , how large is each \n\ncontribution, and in what conditions they contribute, dictates the final format of this \n\nequation. Thus, to simplify this equation, one usually neglects the terms with little \n\nimpact on operating losses. For important terms, the desired accuracy is crucial \n\ncriterion for selecting the modeling complexity of each submodel in Eq. (2.21). \n \n\n? As a phenomenological equation derived based on energy conservation, its \n\ntheoretical background (e.g., supporting assumptions) is evaluated by its verifiable \n\nempirical consequences, independently of any fundamental model possibly \n\nsupporting it. This implies more freedom in the interpretation and use of formulas \n\nbased on Eq. (2.21). \n\n \nEquation (2.21) can also be casted into a form that makes the problem\u2019s dimensionality \n\nexplicit, for example, when solving the one-dimensional distribution of cell voltage along the \n\nbulk flow direction ( ) of the SOFC.  This form not only allows to pinpoint the highest \n\nachievable EMF (    ) in the cell, but also the influence of the local current density     . For \n\ninstance, this local description can help to identify regions where highly concentrated current \n\ndensities are present\n \nand then verify whether a failure mechanism might be associated with \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 47 \n \n\nhigh localized values\n[ 8]\n\n. When used for calculating local electrochemical quantities, this \n\nequation may be rewritten as: \n\n                                                        (2.22) \n\n \n\nWhere the cell voltage       is held invariant along the fuel flow direction. This is the case when \n\nthe SOFC operation is assumed iso-potential along the   direction (i.e., when the electrical \n\nresistance of current-collecting bus bars along the flow direction is much lower than that of \n\nPEN\u2019s through-plane direction). This assumption is mostly true in real, \u201cwell designed\u201d SOFCs\n[ \n\n7, 8, 29]\n. Thus, at first, it can be adopted for the purposes of this work. The concentration and \n\nactivation polarizations can be further divided into anodic and cathodic contributions, \n\n                   (2.23) \n\n \n\n                    (2.24) \n\n \n\n                (2.25) \n\n \n\n                (2.26) \n\n \n\nThus to give\n5\n, \n\n                               |     |         |      | (2.27) \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 illustrates the basic idea conveyed by Eq. (2.27): part of the thermodynamic \n\navailable voltage must be \u201csacrificed\u201d to produce a net current (for simplicity, only activation \n\nand ohmic polarizations have been indicated on this figure).

These formulations are indeed awkward when \n\ndescribing \u201cantiparallel processes\u201d occurring at the anode and cathode, where the faradaic net \n\ncurrent changes signal, and such formulations are at times source of errors in the literature. \n\nFor instance, a number of authors admit the absolute value of cathodic activation polarization \n\nin Eq. (2.27), not considering the same treatment for the cathodic concentration polarization. \n\nThis could suggest the interpretation that \n\n                       |     |              (2.34) \n\n \n\nwhich is incorrect, because in the case of Fig. 2.4, which is based on the definitions of Eq. \n\n(2.30) and (2.31), both       and       are negative signed (cathodic polarity).  Thus, in Eq. \n\n(2.34)        is added to      instead of being subtracted from it. One could alter the definition \n\nof the concentration polarization       so it results positive, but such procedure lacks \n\nthermodynamic consistency (see discussion in \u00a7\u00a73.3). There are other situations in which       \n\nand       might lead to issues with regard to their signals. For example, when using Tafel \n\napproximation in the low current limit\n[ 67]\n\n. The important remark is that Eq. (2.27) is a statement \n\nof the first law of thermodynamics and, as such, should be intrinsically consistent. The mere \n\nuse of absolute values appears to be an artifice (see discussion in \u00a7\u00a72.3.1 and \u00a7\u00a72.3.2). \n\nNonetheless, the fact that       is positive and       is negative depicts a real physical situation \n\nwhere electrochemical reactions proceed in the anodic direction at the anode and in the \n\ncathodic direction at the cathode (assuming that the definition given by Eq. (2.29) is equally \n\napplied to both cathode and anode). \n\nIn Eq. (2.27) the concentration polarization can be accounted for in different ways, for \n\nwhich there are two frequently used approaches. The first one proposes a submodel to \n\ncalculate       (thus       and      ) and is commonly referred to as one having an explicit \n\n(often semi-empirical) evaluation of concentration polarization\n[ 82]\n\n. The other approach does not \n\nprescribe a particular expression to      . In fact, in this approach, this term does not \n\n(explicitly) appear. The latter modeling technique\n[ 83, 72, 84, 85]\n\n considers additional mass transfer \n\ngoverning equations to solve for the concentration of electrochemical species at the TPBs. In \n\nthis case, Eq. (2.27) is slightly modified: \n\n          \n                       |     | (2.35) \n\n \n\nWhere     \n    is the Nernst voltage evaluated at the TPB.

The \n\nformer is a more comprehensive physical quantity, which also includes Galvani potentials (both \n\nare scalar quantities measured in Volts and that can be associated with some electrical energy \n\nscale). The latter, however, besides being quantified as an electric potential, has a specific \n\nmeaning:   represents the electrical work needed when a charged particle is transferred from \n\ninfinite separation in vacuum through a surface shell, which contains excess charges and \n\noriented dipoles.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6: schematics for the definition of   at a point  .     is related to the total work done in bringing a unit \ntest charge (over each acts columbic forces   ) along the   axis, from infinity up to that point  , just inside a given \nbulk phase  (electrolyte or electrode).

Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 59 \n \n\nMore specifically on what concerns Eq. (2.66), published papers in SOFC literature \n\nusually assume that, in equilibrium situations, the condition    \n            \n\n         is always \n\nverified. For such condition to be true, the following assumptions should (at least \n\napproximately) hold: \n\ni. The chemical potential of oxygen ions (    ) should be constant throughout the \n\nelectrolyte thickness. That is, the concentration of charge carriers is \u201chigh enough\u201d \n\nso that there is no material composition variation along this phase\n[ 87]\n\n; and the \n\nelectrolyte phase should be also free of meaningful temperature gradients. \n \n\nii.

In SOFCs, these surface shells form at solid/solid (grain boundary) interfaces wherein \n\nelectrochemical charge-transfer reactions take place, locally interconverting ionic and \n\nelectronic currents to and from those solid phases (see Fig. 2.7). More precisely, the charge-\n\ntransfer is related to the surface potential difference between the inner potential of electrode \n\n(     ) and the inner potential of electrolyte (     ). As the charge carrier, inside the ionic \n\nphase (oxide ion) or electronic phase (electron), approaches the solid/solid interface, it \n\nencounters a steep potential cliff (  ) that ultimately drives the emission current through the \n\nphase boundary (i.e., the number of charges jumping out of or striking a unity area of surface \n\nper unit time). Thus, electrochemical kinetics is a function of   , which in the anode case, for \n\nexample, can be expressed in a local form as (see Eq. (2.59)): \n\n      ?         ?           ?

In the analysis that follows, the contribution of the gas-\n\nphase to this relation will be restricted to the Butler\u2013Volmer and Nernst phenomenological \n\nformalisms.

With such assumptions, one can say that there are no \n\nnoticeable changes in the chemical potential of oxide ions and hence the electrical field \n\nremains as the dominant driving force within the electrolyte (see also \u00a7\u00a73.3.1).

The derivation of an alternative expression for       in the case that Eq. \n\n(2.96) is an oxidation reaction can be handled in a completely analogous fashion.  \n\nOne should note that the faradaic current in the cathodic half-cell has an opposite sign \n\nof that in the anodic half-cell, thus the resulting sign of      must be consistent in each of the \n\nhalf-cells. This is particularly important for equations in which      (or equivalently,   \n ) is \n\nincorporated as a source term, e.g., as in Eq. (2.90). Therefore, the above derivation \n\nprocedure employs sign conventions and requires thermodynamic consistency. That is why in \n\ncalculating the relationships between activation energies, Gibbs energy, overvoltages, and so \n\nforth, it is indispensable that signs are properly accounted for. More specifically, in the case of \n\nthe Butler\u2013Volmer equation (BVE), there is usually a certain convention in writing Eq.

Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 66 \n \n\nlosses, and local interfacial transport phenomena). Furthermore, within the BVE formalism,    \n\npossess only macroscopic coherence (i.e., a \u201cnon-equilibrium surface potential difference\u201d \n\nbetween the bulk of electrode and electrolyte), thereby ignoring its fundamental relation with \n\nthe energy states of charge carriers and hiding most of the details about the electric boundary-\n\nlayer formed at the solid/solid interface. Phenomenological semi-empirical models such as \n\nButler\u2013Volmer kinetics seem to achieve good results under certain circumstances, despite \n\ntheir inherent \u201cmacroscopic degeneracy\u201d\n[ 87,67,75]\n\n. In some situations, however, improved \n\nphysical fidelity is required to correctly describe the mechanism of electrode overvoltage\n[ 75,71]\n\n.  \n\nIn order to have a deeper insight into the relation between    and the net current, it \n\nwould be necessary to model the electron exchange processes at the phase boundary. When \n\nelectrons flow (i.e., when an electronic current is established), the energy conservation implies \n\nthat there must be an interfacial electric field (that is, a potential difference between the two \n\nbulk phases at their interface) that does the work on the transmitted electron. This work (which \n\nis proportional to    on the \u201cmicroscale\u201d) is the difference of the work function associated with \n\nthe extraction of an electron from a molecule and the work function gained by inserting the \n\nelectron to the solid conductor, or vice-versa\n[ 95]\n\n. The appreciation of this process (namely, the \n\ninteraction between charge carriers and bulk materials) can be accomplished using models \n\nsuch as those from Thomas-Fermi theory\n[ 96, 97]\n\n and molecular electronics\n[ 98, 99]\n\n. From the \n\nperspective of these models,    is a potential bias that appears as the difference between the \n\nlocal Fermi-energies (or, somewhat equivalently, between macroscale-continuum \n\nelectrochemical potentials) on the electrode and electrolyte sides. As long as the potential bias \n\nbetween the two sides is maintained, current will flow through the system as the molecule tries \n\n(and fails) to reach equilibrium with both junctions. When    is positive (that is, when the \n\nFermi energy on the electrode is lower than on the electrolyte), electrons will flow from the \n\nelectrolyte to the electrode (accordingly, in this case, the current will flow from electrode to the \n\nelectrolyte and its value is defined as being negative). Conversely, when    is negative, \n\nelectrons will flow from the electrode to the electrolyte. This result endorses the definitions \n\ngiven by Eq. (2.40) and (2.41) in \u00a7\u00a72.3.1. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the traditional design of SOFC anodes and cathodes (e.g.,   -    and    -    \n\ncomposites, respectively), electrochemical reactions do not occur through the entire electrode \n\nlayer. On the contrary, these reactions are concentrated in a reactive region that is thinner than \n\nthe anode (or cathode) total thickness\n[ 100, 101]\n\n, closer to the electrolyte side. This region (of the \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 67 \n \n\norder of 10-30   ) is called the active layer of electrode (see Fig. 2.9), wherein large portion of \n\nthe ionic current (   ) is exchanged to electronic current (  ). As will be examined in detail in \n\n\u00a7\u00a74.3.1 (and also in APENDIX A), a simplified mathematical model of gas-diffusion electrodes \n\ncan be developed to investigate the qualitative effects of mass-transport limitations on the \n\npolarization characteristics within this active layer zone (see Fig. 2.10), when one considers \n\nthe \u201climiting situations\u201d of ideal ionic transport or ideal mass transport of feed-gas. \n\n \nFigure 2.9: three-dimensional (simulated) current streamline distributions in a anode (      ) microstructure. \nRed color and blue color represent, respectively, ionic and electronic currents (figure reproduced from [ 102]). \n\n \n\nConsidering the example of an anode according to Fig. 2.10, oxide ions come from the \n\nelectrolyte (left side), whereas gas molecules arrive from the anode outer layer (right side). \n\nThe conversion reaction consumes neutral gas molecules, and produces currents of electrons \n\nand oxide ions. The feed gas concentration (   ) decreases towards the electrolyte, whereas \n\nthe electronic current (  ) grows and ionic current (   ) decays with the distance from electrolyte \n\ninterface.

In practical terms, this means that there is the \n\nassumption of a zero-dimensional surface reaction and thus the layer is treated as an idealized \n\nzero-thickness surface, which has mass sources/sinks term coupled to the neighboring \n\nelectrode phase. Be that as it may, this reduced model does the same job of current-to-current \n\nconversion, \u201cencapsulating\u201d the description of electrochemical reactions. Whichever model is \n\nused, the judgment for the spatial limits of an active layer is essentially arbitrary without the \n\navailability of experimental data on local parameters and/or properties. \n\nIt is worthwhile to clarify that there are \u201cimprecisions\u201d\n9\n in the way in that polarization is \n\nloosely defined in several works from the SOFC literature, leaving unclear the exact definitions \n\nof activation polarization, concentration (diffusional) polarization, and \u201ctotal\u201d polarization. The \n\nstrict definition of a polarization depends on the chosen electric potential reference and on the \n\nattribution of an equilibrium cell potential\n[ 67]\n\n. Furthermore, there is an apparent indifference \n\n(mainly in terms of nomenclature) between local polarization and \u201ctotal\u201d polarization, where the \n\nlatter could be the total (integrated) activation polarization or the sum of diffusional and \n\nactivation polarizations (i.e., \u201caugmented polarization\u201d). For these reasons, a number of \n\nexplanations are included in the present monograph (especially in section \u00a7\u00a72.3). This \n\naddendum proves necessary to conceptual consistency of further developments (It is fair to \n\n                                                      \n9\n Here it is best to use the term \u201cimprecision\u201d, because the definition of different types of polarizations is usually \n\ndone at the discretion of the researcher. Thus, for one to coin such careless treatment as \u201can error\u201d would be, \nstrictly speaking, exaggerated. On the other hand, however, the application of \u201ccarel ess definitions\u201d can indeed \nconstitute potential sources of errors in subsequent mathematical derivations (see Chapter 4). \n\n? ???  \n\nE\nle\n\nc\ntr\n\no\nly\n\nte\n  \n\nA\nn\n\no\nd\n\ne\n \n\nActive layer \n\nBuffer-layer \n\nElectrolyte  \n\n Fuel \n\n Air \n\nAnode (active layer) \n\nAnode (support layer) \n\nCathode (support layer) \n\nCathode (active layer) \n\n?   \n\n?   \n\n?  ?? \n\n?  \n?  ? \n\n? ?? \n\n?  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ?

Ultimately, such addendum also allows one to bring up aspects \n\nthat are rarely vetted in the SOFC modeling literature, such as the careless definition of \n\n\u201cactivation polarization\u201d and \u201caugmented polarization\u201d and how their misleading definitions \n\nmight affect the modeling of transport phenomena within the gas phase and the ensuing \n\neffects on cell performance (e.g., concentration-induced voltage losses). \n\nBeing acute on certain electrochemical concepts allows one to stress awareness of the \n\nlimits of models herein studied and developed. However, electrochemical modeling \n\nassumptions and their limitations are not thoroughly scrutinized in this work. The objective \n\nherein is solely to clarify immediate inconsistencies that could compromise the fullest \n\ncomprehension of a given mathematical model in the next chapters of this work, which are \n\npertinent to the modeling of gas-phase transport processes. \n\nAt first glance, and without imposing any prior assumption concerning the concrete \n\ncase under study, electrochemical reaction rates are not evenly distributed within the active \n\nlayer of an electrode\n[ 67]\n\n. In fact, in the absence of non-ohmic polarization (that is, when       is \n\nindependent of       and of reacting species concentration), the reaction occurs only at the \n\nboundaries of the active layer and, to minimize the ohmic potential drop, the total current \n\ndensity ( ) tends to immediately divide between the ionic phase (   ) and electronic (  ) phase \n\nin proportion to their effective conductivities\n[ 67]\n\n. This would require, first, that extremely high \n\nreaction rates exist near the interfaces     and/or      (see Fig. 2.10), thereby leading to \n\nthe aforementioned nonuniform reaction distribution, as described in the above paragraphs \n\nand which seems to be the ordinary situation in SOFCs. Thus, in this limiting case, the reaction \n\nrate at the electronic-ionic interface would be proportional to            ?  and the current \n\nentering the composite electrode would immediately distribute itself between both phases, so \n\nthat in each phase the ohmic drop is the same. On the other hand, slow electrode reaction \n\nkinetics \u201cforces\u201d the reaction to be more uniformly distributed so to reduce the local transfer \n\ncurrent (  \n ). In this sense, the effect of activation polarization is to distribute the reaction more \n\nuniformly through the electrode. For instance, if reactive TPBs are sparsely distributed along \n\nthe composite electrode, instead of being concentrated near the boundaries, then electrons \n\nwill have a wider distribution of percolating paths. As a result, the ionic current would also need \n\nto diffuse farther from the electrolyte to the current collector side, through a less conductive \n\n(\u201clonger\u201d)     network, thus increasing ohmic losses. These competing effects of ohmic \n\npotential drop and slow reaction kinetics determine the resulting distribution.

Vertical branches also have elements representing the cell potential     \n   \n\n (figure \n\nmodified from [ 67]). \n\n \n\nFor the problem in the active layer, specifically, five dimensionless ratios govern the \n\ncurrent distribution\n[ 103]\n\n. These can be stated as: a dimensionless current density (   ); a \n\ndimensionless exchange current density (   ); the ratio     ?  of the transfer coefficients in the \n\nBVE; the ratio      ?  of the effective conductivities of the ionic and electronic phases; and an \n\nadditional dimensionless parameter (  ) that indicates the effect of mass transport of the \n\nreacting molecular species on the steady-state reaction distribution (i.e., the magnitude of the \n\nelectrochemical consumption rate relative to the mass-transfer rate).  \n\n    \n            \n\n  \n (\n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n  \n) (2.113) \n\n \n\n   \n \n         \n\n       \n    \n\n \n\n  \n (\n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n  \n) (2.114) \n\n \n\n         (           )?  (2.115) \n\n \n\nwhere   \n  is a \u201creference\u201d exchange current density (see \u00a7\u00a72.3.4 for its precise definition);   is \n\na reference (or scaling) gas diffusion coefficient of the gas mixture; and      is a reference (or \n\nscaling) molar gas concentration. The other parameters are as described in previous pages. \n\nTherefore, the current and reaction distributions along the depth of the electrode may \n\nbe described through use of these dimensionless parameters, indicating that distributions are \n\ninfluenced by the type of activation polarization, by mass transport of the reacting species, and \n\nfinally by the effective conductivities of the two phases (ionic and electronic).

Thus, \n\nelectrodes much thicker than this penetration depth are not fully utilized.  \n\nIn the absence of concentration effects, the nonuniformity of reaction distribution is \n\ndetermined by the parameters     and    \n \n \n[ 67]\n\n. They express the ratios of the competing effects \n\nof ohmic losses and slow electrodes kinetics. For small values of either     and    \n \n, the reaction \n\nis uniform (see Fig 2.12). For large values of either     and    \n \n, the ohmic effect dominates and \n\nthe reaction distribution is mostly nouniform (reaction occurs mainly at the active \n\nlayer/electrolyte interface). The appearance of the ratio     ?  inside these parameters is a \n\ndirect consequence of applying the Butler\u2013Volmer formalism, but its role is difficult to discern. \n\nFor small values of      ? , reaction occurs preferentially near the active layer/electrolyte \n\nboundary at the expense of the region near the outer electrode layer (see Fig. 2.12). This ratio \n\n     ?  serves to shift the reaction from one boundary to the other so that the reaction is \n\nsomewhat more uniform as     approaches   , at constant     (see figures 2.12 and 2.13). If \n\nboth conductivities are non-zero, the ohmic contribution to the voltage drop will eventually \n\ndominate at high current values. If one phase has a much higher conductivity in comparison to \n\nthe other, a double Tafel slope results\n[ 104]\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.12: Reduced current distributions for Tafel polarization: (a) with    ?  ?; and (b) with   ?  ?.  \nSimulation results obtained using the model proposed by Newman and Tobias\n\n[ 103]\n, where          ? . \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\n delta = 0.1\n\n  delta = 1.0\n\n delta = 10\n\n delta=100\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nPosition along thickness, ?  \n\n? ?      \n\n? ?      \n\n? ?     \n\n? ?      \n\nPosition along thickness, ?  \n(b) \n\n \n??  ??\n?? \n\n  \n\n(a) \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ?

These authors have shown that at high \n\ncurrent levels (with Tafel kinetics),      ?  is the length that is more characteristic of the \n\npenetration of the reaction, and that the reaction distribution is independent of the exchange \n\ncurrent density   . However, in the limit approached at low current densities, the nonuniformity \n\nof the reaction increases with increasing values of the parameter    \n \n. Within the Tafel range, \n\nthe authors also found that the relationship between these parameters of nonuniformity could \n\nbe expressed as \n\n   \n \n     (2.116) \n\n \n\nand thus, \n\n  \n\n   \n (\n\n         \n          \n\n               \n)\n  ?\n\n (2.117) \n\n \n\nThus, for uniform concentration, Eq. (2.117) tells us that the reaction distribution becomes less \n\nuniform as one increases the: (i) magnitude of the current density; (ii) the thickness of the \n\nactive layer; or (iii) the sum of the effective resistivities of the two phases. In any case, the \n\npoint of most even distribution will not occur at zero current density unless         ?\n[ 103]\n\n.  \n\nIn the case when there are meaningful concentration gradients of reacting species, the \n\nsteady-state reaction distribution will be shifted more or less strongly towards the active \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\n delta = 1\n\n  delta = 10\n\n delta = 100\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nkappa=sigma\n\nkappa=0.5sigma\n\nkappa=0.1sigma\n\nkappa=0.05sigma\n\nkappa=0.025sigma\n\nPosition along thickness, ?  \n(a) \n\n? ?      \n\n? ?     \n\n? ?      \n\nPosition along thickness, ?  \n(b) \n\n??? ???    \n\n??? ???      \n\n??? ???      \n\n??? ???       \n\n??? ???        \n \n??  ??\n?? \n\n  \n\n? ?     \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ?

When the diffusive transport of reactants/products controls the overall rate of \n\nelectrochemical conversion, other factors will determine the \u201cuseful\u201d thickness of the active \n\nlayer. For instance, for large anodic polarizations, the penetration depth becomes equal to \n\n     ?  (see Eq. (2.113)). However, if mass transfer, as well as the ohmic losses and the \n\nelectrode kinetics have similar importance, then the overall rate of conversion will be a function \n\nof all involved penetration depths, Eq. (2.113) and (2.115). For example, this problem could be \n\ndescribed by the following equations\n[ 103]\n\n, which somewhat combine these dimensionless \n\npenetration depths: \n\n      \n    \n\n  \n     \n   \n\n(            \n       \n\n   \n)    \n\n(2.118) \n     \n\n   \n              \n\n \n\nwhere in Eq. (2.118), specifically, \n\n     \n   \n \n      \n\n    \n\n      \n (2.119) \n\n \n\nand     is the Tafel slope, which is defined as \n\n    \n   \n\n   \n   with         (2.120) \n\n \n\nThe reaction penetration depth may be \u201cmeasured\u201d as either the thickness of the reaction zone \n\nnear electrolyte interface, or as the thickness of the reaction zone starting near the outer-layer \n\ninterface. Thus,    depends on which interface is taken as a reference and on the physics of \n\nthe problem considered (e.g., diffusion-limited or conduction-limited). \n\nFinally, to end this section, attention is driven to one of the more commonly implied \n\nassumptions in the SOFC literature, which considers the electronic phase of the composite \n\nelectrode as a perfect conductor.  Consequentially, for domain interior points one has \n\n      ?    \n\n(2.121) \n  ?  ?    (\n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n  \n) ?\n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n\nand recognizing that      remains a finite value. Such assumption is easily seen by comparing \n\nEq. (2.114) with the following relation used in Kulikovsky\u2019s model (examined in \u00a7\u00a74.3.1): \n\n   \n \n \n\n    \n    \n\n \n\n       \n \n\n          \n \n\n       \n \n\nwhere       \n    ?   is the specific area \n\ndensity of active electrocatalyst \n(2.122) \n\n \n\nAnd taking into account the simplification proposed by Eq. (2.121). This assumption is \n\nequivalent to that made on the derivation of Eq. (2.92) and (2.93) in \u00a7\u00a72.3.2.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 74 \n \n\nAs noted in \u00a7\u00a72.3.2, in typical high-temperature SOFCs the electrolyte-phase \n\nconductivity is several orders of magnitude lower than the electrode-phase conductivity\n10\n\n. \n\nThus, the condition given by Eq. (2.121) can be considered a very good approximation in \n\nmacroscopic modeling (from Fig. 2.13b one verifies that when      ?      (and       ) the \n\nactual variation of the reaction rate profile is minimal). This is surely true for the bulk value of \n\nthe conductivity, but one should acknowledge that the effective value of the electronic \n\nconductivity also depends on the microstructure features of the electron-conducting phase, \n\nhowsoever large this bulk value may. These features might include the existence of internal \n\ncontact resistances (e.g., heterogeneous grain boundaries) and the predominance of a poorly \n\npercolated conducting phase. \n\nIn any event, modern SOFC electrodes are sufficiently well designed to avoid low \n\nelectronic conductivities due to inadequate microstructure features\n[ 8]\n\n. However, during the \n\ncourse of SOFC life-time the composite electrode can suffer some form of microstructural \n\ndegradation stemming from, for example, coarsening processes\n[ 105, 106]\n\n, but this possibility will \n\nnot discussed in this work. \n\n \n\n \n\nHere the focus is on the definition of  ,   \n , and   (consequentially, also of     and   ). As \n\nwill be found out, not only the clarification of these definitions is itself relevant, but rigorous \n\ndefinitions might as well identify problematic and undisclosed assumptions. The definition of   \n\nis in the lines of what has been discussed in \u00a7\u00a72.2.2 (see Eq. (2.28)-(2.38)). \n\nThe form of the phenomenological BVE presents itself in several variations, whose \n\nnumber and type of parameters varies considerably (and somewhat inconsistently) in the \n\nliterature. Compare, for instance, Eq. (2.109) with the following equation that is used in \n\nKulikovsky\u2019s model (see \u00a7\u00a74.3.1) and which expresses the decay of ionic current with  , at a \n\nrate given by Butler\u2013Volmer electrode kinetics (RHS of the equation): \n\n       \n\n  \n    \n\n  (       ? )\n \n[        ?            ?  ]       \n\n  (       ? )\n \n         ?   (2.123) \n\n \n\n In Eq. (2.109) the concentration of reactants and products multiply each exponential factor \n\nseparately, while in (2.123) only the reactant concentration is used, which multiplies both \n\nexponentials indistinctively. Thus, one may conclude that these equations are not directly \n\ncomparable, even though both forms might be applied to model \u201cthe same problem\u201d. For that \n\n                                                      \n10\n\n e.g.,    \n   \n\n   3 [     ] and   \n   \n\n      [     ], at       [  ], for an anode made of porous   /   \n[ 8]\n\n. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 75 \n \n\ntheir parameters would need to be adjusted accordingly. In relation to Eq. (2.123), when it is \n\nsaid that the exponent \u201c \u201d is the reaction order in respect to the feed gas, one must stress \n\nawareness about this statement. That is, this exponent is really a phenomenological parameter \n\nthat does not necessarily have a formal kinetic meaning. It is, in the case of Eq. (2.123), a \n\npseudo reaction order that \u201cblends\u201d the effects of both forward and reverse reactions. After \n\nhaving acknowledged this distinction, some comparisons are now put forth. Let     (e.g., \n\nmeasured as             ) be the electrochemical reaction rate expressed by \n\n     \n  \n \n\n    \n \n\n  \n \n\n    \n[        ?            ?  ]      \n\n  [        ?            ?  ] (2.124) \n\n \n\nwhere   \n  (A     ) is a volumetric exchange current density and    ( \n\n  ) is a reaction rate \n\nconstant, which is independent of species concentration. From the equation above, \n\n  \n           \n\n    (2.125) \n\n \n\nComparing this result with Eq. (2.123), one verifies that \n\n  \n    \n\n   (     ? )\n  \n\n             \n   (2.126) \n\n \n\nMeaning that   \n   is an exchange current density evaluated at the concentration     , which is \n\nthus not an arbitrary reference. Otherwise, the exponent \u201c \u201d becomes only an experimentally-\n\nfitted parameter, which convey little or no physical meaning, just to satisfy Eq. (2.124). \n\nIn \u00a7\u00a72.3.1 and \u00a7\u00a72.3.2 it has been pointed out that the activation polarization      is \n\nfunction of the gas-phase composition (see Eq. (2.40), (2.41), (2.64), and (2.65)), but \n\nKulikovsky and some other authors do not usually emphasize this point. The issue lies in what \n\nis the correct definition of \u201c \u201d for what form of BVE. If an implicit approach is used, as per Eq. \n\n(2.35)-(2.39), the definition and hence the evaluation of      depends on     \n   \n\n, which is by its \n\nturn a function of the local gas composition and it accounts for local potential changes induced \n\nby local concentration effects. However, depending upon a different definition of \u201c \u201d it can, \n\nhowever, also include effects due to non-local concentration losses, fact that could generate \n\ndiscrepancies if the modeling is not properly handled (see Chapter 3). Amongst the different \n\npolarizations (\u201c \u201d) that are employed inside the exponentials terms of BVE, here follows the \n\nmost common\n[ 67]\n\n: \n\n?

If one neglects the ohmic losses in the electronic phase and thus if it is assumed \n\nthat the phase potential       is a constant (see \u00a7\u00a72.3.2 and \u00a7\u00a72.3.3). \n \n\nii. And if      is also assumed constant (it has already been seen that, rigorously \n\nspeaking, this potential difference varies along the thickness of the active layer if \n\nthe chemical activity of reacting species is allowed to vary). \n \n\nThat is, from Eq.

(2.140)   is switched in sign in comparison to Eq. (2.141). \n\nThis is because the sign of the current flux (which is oriented the opposite way to the electron \n\nflux) must be physically consistent with the adopted reference frame (e.g., orientation of \n\ncoordinate axes). For example, in the anodic half-cell the current vector is directed from the \n\nanode outer layer toward the electrolyte. If this vector is not pointing in the positive direction of \n\nthe coordinate axis, the current density (electronic and ionic) will be negative -valued. As a \n\nmatter of convenience, it appears that Kulikovsky chose to consider only positive values for \n\nboth polarization and current densities, irrespective of which half-cell (anodic or cathodic) is \n\nmodeled.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 79 \n \n\nTo put it concisely, it is not clear whether \u201c \u201d refers to the activation polarization, \n\nEq.(2.127), or to the total polarization, Eq. (2.128), in Kulikovsky model. More likely it is the \n\nlatter situation, that is, Kulikovsky is modeling the \u201caugmented polarization\u201d and not the \n\nactivation polarization profiles. Only in the case of ideal gas-phase transport is when\u201c \u201d \n\nreduces to \u201c    \u201d. Moreover, If \u201c   is the augmented polarization then Eq. (2.123) is not \n\nrigorously correct because, as has already been pointed out previously, the reactant \n\nconcentration multiplies both the forward and reverse reaction rates. This suggests, in \n\nprinciple, that the feed reactant would have the same stoichiometric coefficient in both sides of \n\nthe chemical reaction equation. In other words, one arrives at the paradoxical conclusion that \n\nin this case the feed gas is neither a reactant nor a product! Nonetheless, the value   \n  still \n\nfollows the expected physics in that the exchange current density increases if either the \n\nreactant or product concentration is increased (see Eq. (2.126) and (2.137)). That is, an \n\nincrease of either reactant or product concentration should shift the equilibrium potential such \n\nthat both the forward and reverse reaction rates remain equal. \n\nBy way of example, if      was to be used in place of  , then one should reformulate the \n\nsystem of equations (2.123) and (2.140) as: \n\n    \n  \n\n      \n              ?

Another interesting result is the negative \n\nsign in front of the term associated with electronic ohmic losses in Eq. (2.145) and (2.150). It \n\nsuggests that by decreasing the electronic conductivity in comparison to the ionic conductivity, \n\nthe average electrochemical reaction rate (e.g.,    ? ?        ) will increase accordingly. \n\nHowever, this will also smooth out the reaction rate profile along the electrode thickness (see \n\nfigures 2.12 and 2.13), fact that might require a thicker active layer, thereby increasing the \n\n\n\nChapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 81 \n \n\noverall ohmic loss. Thus, once more, one verifies the existing compromise between ohmic \n\nlosses and reaction rates, as discussed in \u00a7\u00a72.3.3. \n\nIn one of his models (see APPENDIX A) concerning the case of ideal ionic transport\n11\n\n, \n\nKulikovsky\n[ 12, 107]\n\n has made the inconsistent assumption of a vanishing small overvoltage \n\ngradient (    ), based on the use of an augmented polarization setup. From Eq. (2.151) one \n\nfinds that the augmented polarization   is also function of the concentration polarization       \n\nand for that it is not possible to readily assume that     ,   . The concentration polarization \n\ncan attain sufficient importance to such extent that the overvoltage gradient will vary along the \n\nactive layer thickness. As a result of this undue assumption, the model developed by \n\nKulikovsky in \u00a7\u00a7A.2 is restricted to only low current density values, where concentration \n\npolarization processes are not expected to occur in an important manner. That is, by assuming \n\n     the author also (unduly) restricts the concentration polarization to relatively small \n\nvalues (       ). \n\n                                                      \n11\n\n Thus a case wherein mass transport limitations in the gas-phase are taken into consideration (and thus so are \nconcentration polarizations) and the ionic transport is, on the other hand, disregarded completely. \n\n\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1 6, 17, 18 , 19, 20, 2 1, 22, 23 , 24, 25, 2 6, 27, 2 8, 29, 30, 31, 32, 3 3, 34, 35 , 36, 37, 3 8, 39, 40 ,  41, 42, 4 3, 44, 45, 46, 47, 4 8, 49, 50 , 51, 52, 5 3, 54, 5 5, 56,  57, 5 8, 59, 60 , 61, 62, 6 3, 64, 6 5, 66, 67, 68, 69, 7 0, 71, 72, 73, 74, 7 5, 76, 77 , 78, 79, 8 0, 81, 8 2, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 8 9, 90, 9 1, 92, 93, 94, 95, 9 6, 97, 98, 99, 100 , 101, 10 2, 103, 104, 10 5, 106, 1 07, 10 8  \n\n \n\nUnder real operating conditions, SOFC chemical and electrochemical reactions can \n\nonly proceed at a limited rate. Moreover, the empirical situation is that, with a few exceptions \n\ninvolving extraordinary (idealized) conditions, reactions will proceed slowly. The rate at which \n\nthese reactions can occur will depend on the interplay of multiscale physicochemical \n\nprocesses, which all together are deeply influenced by the micromorphology details of SOFC \n\nfunctional layers. Thus, a practical issue of central importance is to identify and describe, \n\nintelligibly, what limits SOFC reaction rates. This surely is, and has been, an enormous \n\nscientific challenge\n[ 6, 7, 13, 8]\n\n. \n\nAs described in \u00a7\u00a71.3.2, to generate electricity, the SOFC must be continuously \n\nsupplied with fuel and oxidant to avoid fuel cell \u201cstarvation\u201d. Concurrently, products must be \n\ncontinuously removed as to avoid \u201cstrangling\u201d the SOFC. This overall process of supplying \n\nreactants and removing products is what constitutes the seeming, macroscopic essence of fuel \n\ncell mass transport\n1\n. As it will be discussed in more detail, poor mass transfer can lead to \n\nsubstantial performance loss, which is often termed as \u201cconcentration-induced losses\u201d of a \n\nSOFC electrode. This loss is, ultimately, the result of some adverse density distribution of \n\nreactants and products over the active area of electrocatalysts. The gas-phase chemical \n\npotential gradient provides one of the main, but not the only, \u201cthermodynamic forces\u201d driving \n\nthe diffusive transport of reactants and products, to and from the reaction zones, respectively. \n\nThis spatial difference in chemical potential develops, to a great extent, as the result of \n\n                                                      \n1\n The focus of this work is on gas-phase phenomena. However, there is also the solid-phase ionic transport of \n\noxygen ions (in the electrolyte and also in ionic conducting phases of composite electrodes).  Ionic transport is \nactually a subset of mass transport where the mass being transported consists of charged ions\n\n[ 87, 88, 89]\n. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 83 \n \n\nheterogeneous reactions (species consumption/production) occurring within the buffer-layer \n\nand electrode active layers (see figures 1.15 and 3.1). Thus, one can perceive a delicate and \n\nyet dynamic balance between material fluxes and driving forces that might lead to reactant \n\ndepletion, or product accumulation, in the reaction zones, affecting the SOFC performance. \n\nFurthermore, as there is a strong interdependence between mass transport and surface-\n\ncatalyzed reactions, which involves the active (transition-metal) catalyst, one should also take \n\ninto consideration the feedback of chemical reactions in response to the local (spatial varying) \n\nproperties of the catalytic substrate, along the interface between the pore-wall and fluid-layer. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.1: SOFC cross-section illustrating the overall steps related to mass transfer and  interdependent \nprocesses: (1) reactant delivery (transport) into the SOFC; (2) fuel reforming reactions; (3) electrochemical \nreactions; (4) ionic or electronic conduction (charge transport); (5) removal of product and/or reactant excess from \nSOFC (figure by the author).  \n \n\nThe definition of concentration polarization, as ordinarily found in the literature, was \n\ngiven in \u00a7\u00a72.2.2 and expressed by Eq. (2.37) and (2.38) for the anode and cathode, \n\nrespectively. Now, that definition should be expanded through the incorporation of \n\ncomplementary concepts. First and foremost, it will be pointed out that \u201cmass transport loss\u201d \n\nshould not to be (always) taken as equivalent of \u201cconcentration polarization\u201d. SOFC mass \n\ntransport losses encompass more than the sole effect of chemical potential gradients in gas-\n\nphase. These losses can reflect the combination of direct and indirect (cross) effects arising \n\nfrom competing transport phenomena, especially those cross-effects between individual \n\nirreversible processes, whose impact usually lessens the velocity of electrochemical reactions \n\nand that is rarely obvious under a superficial examination of the problem. The discussion to \n\nfollow is restricted to the domain of steady state processes. The analysis of models with \n\nrespect to their shortcomings, misconceptions, and inaccuracies is not pursed at this point, a \n\ntask which is fulfilled in the next chapter wherein chosen models are critically reviewed. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 4 \n\n5 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n5 \n\n4 \n\nAir in Fuel in \n\nElectrolyte Buffer-layer Anode Cathode \n\nFuel \nchannel  \n\n(gas \u201cbulk\u201d) \n\nOxidant \nchannel \n\n(gas \u201cbulk\u201d) \n\n4 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ?

This voltage \u201cbuild-up\u201d portrays the fact that electrochemical potentials \n\nare offsetting one another to maintain the thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e., zero net reaction \n\nrate and balanced electric charges at electroactive sites). More precisely, equilibrium is \n\nestablished when an electrical potential gradient builds up sufficiently to exactly \n\ncounterbalance the chemical potential gradient: \n\n(?     ? \n \n\n)\n        \n\n   (?     ? \n \n\n)\n         \n\n   (3.1) \n\n \n\nFrom which Eq.

Thus, \n\none could say that the chemical potential difference between the bulk gas and the gas \n\neffectively contacting electrochemical reaction sites forms a concentration cell\n[ 109]\n\n, whose cell \n\nvoltage would oppose the overall SOFC\u2019s EMF and which may be seen as a voltage loss \n\n(polarization).

The concentration polarization      , which is \n\ndiscounted from     \n    , may be seen as the \u201cvoltage surplus\u201d that would be available if the \n\nconcentration of electroactive species at the TPB was the same as that in the bulk flow. The \n\npolarization defined by Eq. (3.3) is also known as Nernstian loss, because the effects of gas \n\nconcentration on reversible cell voltage are modeled by the Nernst equation. Considering the \n\ncase of a hydrogen/oxygen SOFC, Eq. (3.2) can be shown to give Eq. Eq. (2.37) and (2.38), \n\nas will be seen in  \u00a7\u00a73.3.1. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 85 \n \n\nWithout delving into the intricate details of convective and diffusive \u201cforces\u201d, which are \n\noften interwoven with other driving forces, the intent here is to first establish a conceptual \n\ninterpretation for the relation between reactants and products transport, and the concentration \n\npolarization (     ). Therefore, it will be of no relevance in what follows to bring forth a \n\ndiscussion about \u201ceverything\u201d that might affect such transport. At this point, it is assumed that \n\ntransport is essentially diffusive and that electrochemical reactions are solely responsible for \n\ndriving the diffusion of gas-phase species.  \n\nIn the example of a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell (see Fig. 3.2), the depletion of    in the \n\nvicinity of the TPB extends out into the anode, because the diffusive transport of   , from the \n\nbulk flow to the reaction zones, has a finite rate. In this example, therefore, the concentration \n\ngradient constitutes the essential driving force for the mass transport process through this \n\nelectrode. The concentration of    in the gas phase falls from its bulk value (        ) at the \n\nflow channel to a lower value (           ) at the anode/electrolyte interface. Here it is assumed \n\nto be possible to define a stagnant gas region (\u201cdiffusion layer\u201d) with diffusion-dominated \n\ntransport. Although the delimitation of such region is unrealistic or, at most, hardly defined, it \n\nintroduces an important characterization parameter: the diffusion layer thickness (     ).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2: simplified mass transport problem in the anode of a SOFC. A perfect mixing of reactants and products \n\nin the bulk flow (gas channel) is assumed, and thus an invariant bulk concentration (         and          ). \n\nElectroactive species are consumed/generated within the active layer, potentially leading to reactant depletion \nor/and product accumulation.

The diffusion layer thickness, being itself an abstraction, does \n\nnot coincide, necessarily, with the electrode thickness.  In other words, the diffusion layer \n\nthickness should be taken as a pseudo-geometric parameter. In the oversimplified situation \n\ndepicted in Fig. 3.2, the reactant depletion (or product accumulation) can affect SOFC \n\nperformance through the combination of two \u201closs effects\u201d, namely \u201cNernstian losses\u201d and \n\n\u201cconcentration-induced kinetic losses\u201d. The collective effect of these losses is what the \n\nliterature generally refers to as the SOFC mass transport losses. As already advised in the \n\npreceding paragraphs, the mass transport loss revels itself far more complex than this \n\nprevailing view wherein the loss is only associated with the difference between TPB and bulk \n\nconcentrations of reactants and products (see \u00a7\u00a73.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe electric potential difference (  ) of the \u201cvirtual\u201d concentration cell that forms on the \n\nanode or cathode can be evaluated by assuming that the respective electrochemical \n\npotentials, at either \u201cbulk conditions\u201d or \u201cthree-phase-boundary conditions\u201d, are offsetting one \n\nanother to maintain the thermodynamic equilibrium.

Thus, one finds that \n\nthe chemical activity of (bulk interstitial) oxide-ions does not influence the value of \n\nconcentration polarization (more precisely, the value of Nernstian polarization) at the limit \n\nwhen the electric potential difference within the phases is due only to ohmic effects. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 90 \n \n\n \n\nIn certain situations common to SOFC operation at steady state, the dependence of \n\n   \n     on the oxygen partial pressure     becomes relatively unimportant for              \n\n[ \n\n111, 75, 112, 113]\n, even though the electrode kinetics itself (e.g., the exchange current density) is \n\nstill significantly affected by     (see \u00a7\u00a73.5).  Nevertheless, one might question what would be \n\nthe indirect effect (if any) of surface ad-ions on the evaluation of concentration polarization due \n\nto changes on the oxygen partial pressure near to that surface.  Here one is not interested in \n\nhow to rigorously correct for interfacial and other polarization effects, neither does one \n\nconsider the complicated double-layer transients taking place near the solid-solid interfaces, \n\nhowever. As seen in \u00a7\u00a73.3.1, a simpler description can be obtained for small to moderate \n\ncurrent densities when electrode\u2019s bulk composition should not be affected and the stationary \n\ncurrent density is readily given by the electric field (ohmic) term alone of the electrochemical \n\npotential. Thus, a closed definition of concentration polarization\n2\n does not seem to pose a \n\nsignificant problem in this case.  \n\nIn the following, it is assumed for simplicity that the ionic conductivity is solely due to \n\noxygen-ions. Moreover, it is considered a conductivity that is averaged over all oxygen-ions \n\n(both immobile and rapid defect particles\n[ 87]\n\n).

However, here \n\n           \n   is selected. Other chosen values are:               \n\n          \n[ 83, 118, 119, \n\n121]\n;            \n\n   \n[ 17, 122, 123]\n\n;          \n        \n\n[ 112, 126, 127]\n;            \n\n   \n[ 112, 128, 129, 130, \n\n131, ]\n;               \n\n    . Although these proposed values are expected to fall within a typical \n\nrange for cathodes where perovskite oxides of ionic character are employed, they certainly \n\nconvey an inordinate level of arbitrariness, which is only acceptable for the purpose of an \n\nillustrative exercise\n6\n. It should be also emphasized that in this study oxygen surface exchange \n\nis assumed to occur, predominately, via surface oxygen ions (i.e.,   as the dominant reaction \n\nspecies) and that    is the surface diffusion coefficient of adsorbate in the low-coverage limit. \n\nUsing the above parameter values,     was calculated as          \n            at \n\nconditions of              and         , for which (   )          . In Fig. 3.4, a curve \n\nusing these parameters was indicated as \"Varying (   )    - Eq. (3.40), (3.54)\u201d. It can be \n\nseen that this curve presents a different behavior, where it now \u201cintersects the other curves\u201d \n\nbecause (   )    is no longer a fixed value, as it varies with respect to        (   ). Thus, \n\nwhen inspecting Fig. 3.4 with regard to the curve \u201cVarying (   )    - Eq. (3.40), (3.54)\u201d one \n\nfinds that     \n   varies from       up to       in the interval between              to \n\n            . If it is assumed that the overall change in the activity (   \n   ) of bulk oxygen ions \n\n(at the vicinity of electrode/electrolyte interface) varies in the same proportion (     of \n\nrelative variation), one obtains a concentration polarization\n7\n (     ) roughly of the order of \n\n      . Considering a narrow interval, from              up to         , the concentration \n\npolarization caused by surface ad-ions would be now      . If, on the other hand, one \n\nselects any of the other curves represented by Eq. (3.40), with (   )    fixed down to      , \n\nthe variation of     \n   is virtually negligible (considering the same interval of oxygen partial \n\npressures) and thus         when due to surface ad-ions. \n\n  \n\n                                                      \n5\n Here one tries to not overestimate the importance of the surface polarization effect on the adsorption process of \n\noxygen ions, by \u201cunderestimating\u201d the value of (   )   . For high values of (   )    the ascending curve     \n   vs \n\n    becomes a plateau, i.e.      \n   becomes insensible to oxygen partial pressure. The increase of (   )    implies \n\na reduction of oxygen adsorption energy and thus an effective enhancement of adsorption kinetics. The relation \n\n    \n       \n\n  (   ), however, is the main effect under study in section. \n \n \n\n6\n The level of uncertainty regarding the effective rate constant         for the desorption reaction (i.e., reverse \n\nreaction of   ( )       ( )     ( )) is particularly worrisome\n[ 129, 131]\n\n. \n \n7\n Evaluated using Eq. (3.14) with support of Eq.  (3.32) and (3.34), and also assuming that bulk mass action \n\nconstants (      and    \n  ) remain invariant with respect to    . \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 100 \n \n\nThe above conclusions are to a great extent speculative in nature, because they are \n\ncompromised by two main limitations: firstly, the uncertainty concerning the parameter values \n\nthat have been chosen in the study; secondly, the intrinsic limitation of a mean-field \n\napproximation when using a phenomenological kinetics description for nanoscale-driven \n\nheterogeneous catalytic processes\n[ 55, 132, 133]\n\n.  Furthermore, it is certainly difficult to conceive \n\nan experimental setup, or a \u201cthought experiment\u201d for that matter, where concentration-induced \n\npolarizations caused by adsorbed surface species could be actually measured or somewhat \n\nquantified. For instance, changes in the oxygen partial pressure can also lead to other \u201csecond \n\norder\u201d voltage losses, such as those related to electronic leakage in ionic-conducting materials\n[ \n\n8]\n, whose individual effect would be troublesome to identify and measure. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNernstian losses are simply the cell voltage decrease across the electrode thickness \n\n(i.e., along electrode\u2019s through-plane direction, see Fig. 3.2), which may be predicted by Eq. \n\n(3.3) in the situations when the reactant concentration at the TPB is decreased relative to the \n\nbulk concentration; and/or the product concentration at the TPB is increased relative to the \n\nbulk concentration. If the difference in concentration is assumed to stem from diffusion-\n\ncontrolled transport, at steady state, the flux of reactants and products down the concentration \n\ngradients should match the consumption/production rate of reactants/products at the TPB: \n\n         ?   ?? (  electroactive reactant or product) (3.55) \n\n \n\nwhere   is the cell operating current density;     is the diffusive molar flux of a reactant towards \n\nthe TPB (or the diffusive molar flux of a product away from the TPB); and  ? is the (normal) \n\noutward pointing unit vector to the electrode/electrolyte interface. Introducing a simple Fickian \n\ndefinition for the diffusion flux in the case of    (i.e., anode), Eq. (3.55)  may be written as \n\n          [    \n      (   )]          \n\n    \n(                    )\n\n        \n \n\n(3.56) \n\n                          \n          \n\n       \n   \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere    \n    is an effective (or rather, an experimentally representative) diffusivity for    within \n\nthe anode porous layer. This simplified equation indicates that the reactant concentration in \n\nthe electrode/electrolyte interface depends on  ,         , and    \n   . Thus, as the value of   \n\nincreases, the reactant depletion effect is amplified. That is, the higher the current density, the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 101 \n \n\nworse the concentration-induced loss. Equation (3.56) also states that this concentration loss \n\ncan be minimized if the diffusion layer thickness is reduced or the diffusivity is somehow \n\nincreased. Analytical expressions such as Eq. (3.56), which employ physically measurable \n\nparameters, have been used in the SOFC literature extensively to determine anodic or \n\ncathodic concentration polarizations\n[ 82, 134]\n\n (see also Chapter 4). These expressions vary \n\nsignificantly in both their form and prediction range, depending on, for instance, the number of \n\nparameters considered, the constitutive relation used for the diffusive flux (e.g., \u201cFick\u2019s law\u201d, \n\n\u201cgeneralized Fick\u2019s law\u201d, \u201cMaxwell-Stefan\u201d), if the fuel and oxidant inlet gas streams were \n\nadmitted pure or diluted with some inert gas, and so on.  \n\nMore often than not, analytical expressions that are employed to evaluate concentration \n\npolarization make use of an important parameter, commonly termed as the limiting current \n\ndensity (  ), to describe both anode (     ) and cathode (     ) mass transfer processes. The \n\nanode-limiting current density is usually defined\n[ 76, 8]\n\n as the current density at which the \n\ninterfacial fuel partial pressure at the anode/electrolyte interface (i.e., at TPBs) is zero (the cell \n\nis starved of fuel). Similarly, the cathode-limiting current density is defined as the current \n\ndensity at which the interfacial oxygen partial pressure at the cathode/electrolyte interface is \n\nzero (the cell is starved of oxidant). It is a material characteristic of the SOFC and provides a \n\nmeasure of the resistance to concentration polarizations (a higher    implies potentially lower \n\nlosses). The limiting current density can be calculated from Eq. (3.56) by setting              : \n\n      \n           \n\n            \n\n        \n  \n\n       \n            \n\n        \n  \n\n       \n            \n\n           \n (3.57) \n\n \n\nAnd similarly for the cathode: \n\n      \n           \n\n            \n\n        \n \n\n       \n            \n\n        \n \n\n       \n            \n\n           \n  (3.58) \n\n \n\nAnalogous expressions can be developed to account for product accumulation effects, \n\nin lieu of considering only reactant depletion effects. Here, for simplicity, the above analytical \n\nexpressions consider only depletion effects. The limiting current density represents a \n\ntheoretical upper limit for mass transport (see Fig. 3.7), as the SOFC cannot sustain higher \n\ncurrent densities than that which causes the fuel/oxidant concentration to fall to near zero at \n\nTPBs. Even though Fig. 3.7 seemingly suggests that the limiting current would constitute a \n\n\u201cdistant limit\u201d for SOFC operation, it is important to stress that concentration losses can be \n\nsignificant even at lower current densities, contrary to what is generally acknowledged in the \n\nliterature.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ?

(3.56) and (3.57), the ratio                      may be written as: \n\n        \n\n           \n \n\n(                         \n    )\n\n(                         \n    )  (                     \n\n    )\n \n\n     \n       \n\n  (3.59) \n\n \n\nSubstituting this result into Eq.

(3.60) or (3.61), as the operating current density approaches its limiting value, that is \n\nwhen         (or        ), the term       (or      ) approaches infinity (with distinct lateral \n\nlimits, i.e. there is a jump discontinuity). However, the maximum value of  \n    \n\n is physically \n\nlimited by the OCV. Thus, the maximum current density will be always less then   .  Moreover, \n\nother voltage losses (e.g., ohmic and activation losses) may degrade the SOFC operating \n\nvoltage to zero, well before    is ever reached. \n\nHere again, expressions such as equations (3.60) and (3.61) can also vary significantly \n\nin both their form and prediction scope (see \u00a7\u00a74.4). At first glance, these expressions may \n\nseem to dictate a general asymptotic behavior of SOFCs. However, this latter observation is \n\nnot founded on fundamental arguments.

This implies that both interpretation and use of such formulae \n\nare (or should be) restricted to those experimental conditions. For instance, even the \n\nubiquitous assumption that             drops to zero as          is not always correct, \n\nsometimes leading to unphysical approximations\n[ 135]\n\n. Furthermore, up to this moment, there \n\nare no reliable quantitative experiments carried out to investigate the effects on correlated \n\nprocesses that occur very near this seeming stringent limit, such as space charge\n[ 136]\n\n and \n\ninterfacial strain effects\n[ 137]\n\n, which could also influence gas transport mechanisms. \n\n \n\n \n\nThere is another cell operation-related effect that (sometimes) is not attributed (directly) \n\nto concentration polarization, but it is an effect that is nonetheless a form of concentration-\n\ninduced voltage loss. If the gas channel inlet stream is not pure fuel/oxidant, there is an \n\nirreversible mixing of gases along the channel\u2019s mean flow direction, as progressively more \n\nfuel/oxidant is used in the chemical reactions (e.g., bulk flow gets diluted in respect to \n\nfuel/oxidant), causing the cell voltage to fall (see Fig. 3.8). In the case of a fuel channel, the \n\nleaner the mixture, the lower is the available cell voltage (see Fig. 3.9). Therefore, in real \n\noperating situations, the fuel can never be fully consumed in the SOFC itself and some of it \n\nmust be left in the anode exhaust stream\n[ 4, 13]\n\n. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8: straight fuel channel of a SOFC anode and the hydrogen concentration profile along that channel, \nhere represented through a simplified quasi-2D model (see also \u00a7\u00a74.3.2 and \u00a7\u00a74.10.2) (figure by the author) \n\n \n\nThis mixing effect by fuel utilization is a critical aspect of SOFC performance, as it can \n\nstrikingly reduce the electric power available.

The difference between \n\nEq. (3.64) and (3.65) is clear. The first one explicitly considers the influence from the \n\nconcentration of reactants and products at anode/electrolyte reaction sites, whereas the \n\nsecond form does not.  \n\nA similar expression to Eq. (3.60) can be obtained to account for the \u201ckinetic loss\u201d in the \n\ncase the reactant concentration at the TPB is decreased relative bulk concentration. \n\nAccordingly, the bulk concentration          should be used in the Eq. (3.64), in place of \n\n           . The goal here is just to take this effect (\u201cconcentration difference between the bulk \n\nand the TPB\u201d) out from the activation polarization (     ) and consider this effect as an \n\nadditional term inside the concentration polarization (     ). This is similar to what have been \n\ndiscussed about reversible voltages (i.e.,     \n    versus     \n\n    ) during the definition of \n\nconcentration polarization. For illustrative purposes, such derivation can be realized using a \n\nsimplified BVE, only valid for the high-current-density region (within which the cathodic term in \n\nEq.

(3.70) in lieu of Eq. (3.60) is of questionable usefulness, as the \n\nformer relies in a very particular definition of concentration polarization which, as mentioned in \n\nthe foregoing, is seldom invoked. The so-called \u201cconcentration-induced kinetic losses\u201d, as \n\ndefined by Eq. (3.69), might be seen as an indirect concentration loss, rather than the \n\nconcentration polarization itself. Nonetheless, such \u201cconceptual artificiality\u201d, applied in order to \n\ndistinguish between the conditions at the TPB from that of the bulk flow, could be of interest if \n\none is concerned in \u201cbookkeeping\u201d several types of polarizations, based on somewhat \n\ndiscretionary criterion for identifying these very same polarizations (similar to what has been \n\npointed out in \u00a7\u00a72.3). What should be clear is that in using Eq. (3.67) and (3.70) one is actually \n\n\u201ctransferring the evaluation\u201d of        \n   \n\n from the term       to       (see also discussion in \n\n\u00a7\u00a72.3.4 and [ 143]). In other words, the effect of species concentration on potential steps, \n\nnamely (note that the expressions below assume local equilibrium in the ionic phase of both \n\nanode and cathode\n[ 144, 84, 102, 145]\n\n), \n\n       \n   \n\n (         )  \n \n\n \n\n       \n(            \n\n )\n   \n\n , in the anode (3.71) \n\n \n\n       \n   \n\n (         )  \n \n\n \n\n       \n(    \n\n     )\n   \n\n , in the cathode (3.72) \n\n \n\nHave been now taken into account through modified expressions for       and      , \n\nrespectively, akin to the formula given by Eq. (3.70) in the case of anode. Thus, in this \n\nparticular case, the voltage losses       and       do not constitute pure concentration \n\npolarizations in the \u201cNernstian sense\u201d, but a \u201chybrid polarization\u201d that also incorporates indirect \n\nlosses (     ) associated to electrode kinetics, caused by changes in species concentration. \n\nThe usage of Eq. (3.70) can become difficult to work with, if the corresponding \n\nphenomenological description of electrode kinetics is rather complex. For example, \n\nexpressions for the exchange current density        (or, equivalently,   \n ) are also themselves \n\nfunctions of species concentration\n[ 83, 146, 84, 75, 121]\n\n, as seen in \u00a7\u00a72.3.4. Particularly, the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 108 \n \n\ndependence of        on the surface coverage of oxide-ions (    \n  ) might also be explicitly \n\nconsidered\n[ 111, 116, 75, 121]\n\n, thereby constituting another potential source of concentration-\n\ninduced kinetic losses. However, this type of dependence is usually not described in a simple \n\nmathematical form that would benefit the formalism (and usefulness) of Eq. (3.70).  Take, for \n\ninstance, the following expression for the exchange current density of a MIEC electrode\n[ 111]\n\n: \n\n                      \n          (\n\n     \n  \n\n)    with      (    \n     )  (3.73) \n\n \n\nwhere        is the rate constant (evaluated at equilibrium conditions) of the reverse reaction, \n\ne.g. Eq. (3.24a), which is also admitted to be the rate-limiting step in the case of this equation. \n\nTo derive an expression in the form of Eq. (3.64) using the result of Eq. (3.73), so to obtain a \n\nformula as directed by Eq. (3.70), is not quite straightforward. More importantly, the merits of \n\nsuch derivation are not obvious on their own. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe intent of this section is not put forth actual arguments to prove or disprove likely \n\ncross-effects, but to furnish a few brief remarks, which apparently departure from the main \n\nsubject of this dissertation (i.e., they are in fact brief digressions), that could illustrate what one \n\nreally refers to when one discusses the relation between mass transport and cross-effects. In \n\ndiscussing cross-effects that stem from concurrent transport phenomena and how they can (or \n\ncannot) determine single-cell performance, the aim is to go beyond the topics frequently \n\ncovered by the literature about mass transport in SOFCs. Usually, these cross-effects are \n\neither tacitly assumed to be negligible or the knowledge of their existence is just ignored. In the \n\nrare occasions when some of these cross-effects are evaluated, the applied phenomenological \n\ntheory is, more often than not, misconceived\n[ 59, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153]\n\n.  \n\nThe term \u201ccross-effects\u201d is a designation employed here to express the complex \n\ninteraction between multiscale-multiphysics processes. The manifestation of cross-effects has \n\nmany facets. For instance, they can manifest when physicochemical processes taking place on \n\ndissimilar spatio-temporal scales become somehow \u201clinked\u201d (or coupled) through the so-called \n\n\u201cbridging scales\u201d\n[ 154, 155]\n\n. That is, these processes can start to interact once their characteristic \n\nscales \u201coverlap\u201d (i.e., when they are within the same finite scale limit) and the constraints \n\nlimiting their ability to influence each other are somewhat \u201cweakened\u201d. Here, particularly, the \n\nconcept of \u201cbridging scales\u201d is inserted in the context of developing accurate large scale \n\ndescriptions of particles interacting in the small scale\n[ 156]\n\n, especially when microscopic \n\ninteractions emerge on a large scale and the specific (\u201cunaveraged\u201d) details from their \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 109 \n \n\nmicroworld affect the validity of macroscale deterministic field equations. Very crudely this is to \n\nsay that the hydrodynamic behavior of microscopic systems non-longer has an infinite scale \n\nseparation\n[ 156, 157, 158]\n\n.  \n\nSince a proper description of \u201cmicroscale-to-macroscale interactions\u201d depends on \n\nspecific mathematical models, cross-effects may be seen as the physical manifestation of the \n\nmany possible mathematical couplings that are allowed to occur as a coupled effect of \n\nirreversible processes, under certain conditions, according to an established theoretical \n\nframework. Among the existing frameworks, the one proposed by the thermodynamics of \n\nirreversible processes\n8\n (TIP)\n\n[ 79, 80, 159, 160, 161]\n seems to provide the most intelligible (and \n\nnumerous) examples in the mass transfer literature. Moreover, engineers (specially chemical \n\nengineers) are usually acquainted with TIP, as it forms the cornerstone of the so-called linear \n\nphenomenological transport theory, or just \u201ctransport phenomena theory\u201d\n[ 162, 163]\n\n. Presumably, \n\nthe most common examples of cross-effects (or \u201creciprocal phenomena\u201d, in the usual \n\nterminology used by TIP) between irreversible processes are\n[ 45, 164]\n\n: (i) coupling of heat and \n\nmass diffusive transports, namely Soret-Dufour effects; (ii) thermoelectric phenomena, namely \n\nPeltier\u2013Seebeck-Thomson effects; (iii) electrokinetic (and mechano-electric) effects; (iv) and \n\nthe lesser-known, \u201cchemical viscosity\u201d\n[ 165]\n\n.  \n\nHowever, the results from this specific continuum theory ought not to be used in \n\ndrawing definitive conclusions about what cross-effects are or whether they can or cannot \n\noccur (e.g., see debate on the illusive  \u201cCurie principle\u201d\n[ 148, 150, 151]\n\n). First and foremost, one \n\nwould need to start with more \u201cconceptually robust\u201d frameworks, such as rational \n\nthermodynamics, extended non-equilibrium theories, mesoscopic hydrodynamics, and the like\n[ \n\n150, 166]\n. This is indeed the case when \u201ccross-effects\u201d are to be generalized to include additional \n\ncross-relations between driving forces, property fluxes, and constraining surfaces; relations \n\nthat are not considered by classical theories of transport phenomena (e.g., see [ 167]). On the \n\nother hand, \u201cextended frameworks\u201d often require intricate mathematical developments and \n\nvigorous diligence in order to perceive the abstract mathematics inherent to these more \n\nadvanced theories. For this reason, TIP is usually employed with the intent of constructing \n\nsimplified expositions. \n\nIn any event, it is important to have in mind the intrinsic limitations and the possible \n\ninconsistencies of applying the linear theory of transport phenomena (unfortunately, however, \n\nthis is seldom the case in the literature). The ordinary case is that these limitations are only \n\ndiscussed when the possible shortcomings of the local equilibrium hypothesis\n[ 79]\n\n (or postulate) \n\nare brought about. The \u201cviolation\u201d or inadequacy of this theoretical assumption is quite often \n\n                                                      \n8\n Also referred to as linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics or classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 110 \n \n\njustified only for systems \u201cfar-from-equilibrium\u201d\n[ 168]\n\n. Even though this is surely true, it remains \n\nto be properly defined what is the \u201cfar-from-equilibrium physics\u201d one is specifically talking \n\nabout. Concerning this aspect, the analysis of \u201cequilibrium versus non-equilibrium\u201d states in \n\nnon-condensed matter seems to be restricted to the evaluation of the relative importance of \n\nlocal gradients in state variables\n[ 169, 170]\n\n. Thus, emphasis is only placed on the gradient \n\nmagnitude itself and not on the effects related to transport processes \u201ccompeting\u201d on disparate \n\nphysical scales, the latter case being (often) overlooked. This is to say that it is not solely the \n\nmagnitude of local gradients that should be taken into consideration when evaluating cross-\n\neffects, but also the comparative importance (e.g., ratio) between gradients of different state \n\nvariables and how these are correlated over their characteristic length and time scales. \n\nFurthermore, failure to recognize the correct number of degrees of freedom in the \n\n\u201cmicroscopic\u201d thermodynamic description can lead to a subtle violation of the \u201clocal equilibrium\u201d \n\npostulate, which lies in the core of TIP theory. \n\nAs it has been stated above, the validity of phenomenological macroscale equations \n\ncan be compromised when the large scale description, provided by these equations, is \n\ncontrolled by the details of microscopic interactions. In practice, however, many times all that \n\none can observe are changes in the macroscopic state described by gas quantities (e.g., \n\ndensity, velocity, temperature, stresses, and heat flux) that are (supposedly) related to suitable \n\naverages of quantities depending on microscopic states\n[ 171]\n\n. From this point of view, one \n\nneeds to establish certain hypotheses regarding the structure and interaction of molecules, for \n\nwhich the precise details are rarely known unless for only oversimplified systems. At this point, \n\none faces a great difficulty that affects not only the TIP framework, but virtually any \n\nmacroscale-continuum phenomenological approach (e.g., see [ 172]):  \u201cto explain things that \n\nare seen and directly measurable by means of imagined things that are not seen and not \n\ndirectly measurable\u201d\n[ 171]\n\n. Based on these established hypotheses, one needs to ascertain \n\nwhether measurable macroscopic quantities do or do not approximate the a priori assumed \n\nrelations between those macroscopic gas quantities. It seems apparent that the imperfect \n\nrepresentation of the actual molecular behavior by \u201cmodel molecules\u201d or \u201cfictitious particles\u201d\n[ \n\n171, 77]\n might impair any successful undertaking. The odds of getting plausible results are further \n\nminimized when there is the necessity of considering only the description of ideal systems, in \n\ncontrast to more realistic situations wherein definitions such as the mean free path, for \n\nexample, can lose some of their definiteness if the molecules are surrounded by \u201cnon-\n\nidealized\u201d force fields\n[ 173, 174]\n\n. On the other hand, the modeling complexity might be \n\nenormously magnified if some of these simplifying conditions (e.g., absence of force fields) are \n\nrelaxed to the detriment of a realistic description.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 111 \n \n\nIn the traditional approach it is usual to begin with the necessary governing equations\n9\n \n\nand a set of general constitutive equations (sometimes also referred to as \u201crate equati ons\u201d) \n\nbased on the principles (and accepted hypotheses) from TIP. In the context of TIP, rate \n\nequations are flux relations needed in order to relate mass, momentum, and energy fluxes. On \n\nthis particular aspect, many existing mathematical models utterly fail, insofar they \u201care unable\u201d \n\nto recognize the coupling between additional fluxes and thermodynamic driving forces, beyond \n\nthose dictated by the existing state of affairs in mass transfer theories, such as the \u201cCurie \n\nPrinciple\u201d\n[ 80, 159, 162]\n\n. Extended non-equilibrium theories show\n[ 150, 149, 175, 176]\n\n, however, that the \n\nproperty expressed by the \u201cCurie principle\u201d follows from pure tensorial (isomorphism) \n\narguments, i.e. from the isotropy of linear constitutive functions and from the representation \n\ntheorems of such functions\n[ 177, 178]\n\n. On the other hand, theorems for nonlinear isotropic \n\nconstitutive functions (e.g., see [ 179, 180]) show that this \u201cprinciple\u201d is not valid in general. \n\nThus, in spite of many TIP advocators\n \nhave been contumaciously defending the \u201cCurie \n\nprinciple\u201d using mostly rhetorical arguments\n[ 181, 162, 65, 64]\n\n, it must not be considered a \n\ncomprehensive physically-based restriction. \n\nMore specifically, and what is of most interest in this dissertation work, the \n\nphenomenological modeling of mass diffusion in multicomponent fluid systems\n[ 182, 183, 184, 64, 185, \n\n186, 187, 188]\n has also been littered by this theoretical myopia originated from the \u201cCurie principle\u201d \n\nstigma, even in the cases where the model was originally derived using the results of kinetic \n\ntheory or based on statistical mechanics considerations. In addition, it is not uncommon to \n\nhave errors in the derivation of transport equations that are really hard to grasp, because they \n\narise from subtle inconsistences when one tries to translate \u201cconcepts from the microworld\u201d to \n\nthe large scale description. This is the case of [ 188], wherein an erroneous formulation of the \n\ninterspecies \u201cdiffusion kinetic energy\u201d\n[ 60, 189]\n\n leads to misleading assertions about the \u201cwhat is \n\ncorrect expression\u201d of the chemical potential, when formulated as the driving force for mass \n\ndiffusion processes. There are exceptions, certainly, or at least there are partial exceptions, \n\nwhere consistent mathematical models were indeed derived based on a phenomenological \n\ndescription of hydrodynamic diffusion, but these works (e.g., see [ 190, 191, 192]) have been \n\neither obscured over the years or have not attracted enough attention from scholars in both the \n\nchemical engineering and SOFC research communities. Still in the context of mass diffusion, \n\nexamples of cross-effects that have been commonly overlooked by unfavorable analyzes, \n\nbiased by the views of TIP, include: (i) diffusion slip\n[ 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]\n\n phenomenon\n10\n\n; (ii) \n\n                                                      \n9\n Governing equations are usually referred to as \u201cconservation laws\u201d, although a better terminology would be \n\n\u201cbalance laws\u201d as some of these equations are not really, strictly speaking, statements of conserved quantities \n(such as in the case of the specific entropy\n\n[ 78]\n). \n\n \n10\n\n  Also referred to as the \u201cKramers-Kistemaker effect\u201d. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 112 \n \n\nbarodiffusion\n[ 200, 195, 201]\n\n, and (iii) shear-Induced migration\n[ 202]\n\n (non-equilibrium \u201cdiffusion-like\u201d \n\nmovement of mass, which is influenced by the presence of walls, as in the case of rarefied gas \n\nflows in porous media\n[ 203, 204, 153, 205]\n\n).  \n\nModern installments of classical textbooks on mass transfer, such as the works of Bird \n\net al.\n[ 162]\n\n, Deen\n[ 206]\n\n, and Slattery\n[ 207]\n\n, still relies on a faulty understanding of multicomponent \n\nmass diffusion, by disregarding \u201cnon-conventional\u201d cross-effects and (as will be addressed in \n\nthe next paragraphs) also the effects of chemical reactions on diffusive transport, momentum \n\nclosure, and the ratio of total mass fluxes. Furthermore, the Curie principle is again invoked to \n\nstate that diffusion flux, chemical reactions, and momentum do not interact whatsoever, even \n\nthough there is empirical evidence proving otherwise\n[ 202, 208, 165]\n\n. It is interesting to note, \n\nhowever, that Landau and Lifshitz\n[ 209]\n\n, in their famous and respected  \u201cCourse of Theoretical \n\nPhysics\u201d, have made an important comment that goes beyond their typical TIP-based \n\nderivation for the equations of fluid dynamics. They recognized that (based on kinetic theory \n\narguments) the high-order derivatives of momentum quantities, such as the Laplacian of the \n\nvelocity field, may couple with the diffusion density vector (i.e., mass flux), depending on the \n\norder of magnitude of certain characteristic length scales that govern the rate of momentum \n\ntransfer. Here Landau and Lifshitz were referring to the barodiffusion effect, as conceived by \n\nZhdanov and coauthors\n[ 200]\n\n. \n\nTo conclude the present section, another matter of great controversy, now concerning \n\nthe ratios between species fluxes, is presented. Although many works in the literature discuss \n\na physically motivated origin for the ratio of the total mass (or molar)  fluxes\n[ 210, 59, 211, 212, 213, 214, \n\n197, 215, 216]\n, this is not a completely solved issue and it remains, to a great extent, a zone of \n\ntheoretical uncertainty. Equimolar counter-diffusion, Graham\u2019s Law, and flux ratios defined by \n\nchemical reaction stoichiometry are among the various alleged flux \u201cconstraints\u201d. Nevertheless, \n\none must note that in the absence of chemical reactions the ratio of fluxes is beyond any \n\n\u201cpredetermined control\"\u201d and flux ratios must adjust themselves to satisfy the balance law of \n\nmomentum (for both the mean motion and for each species contained in the gas mixture). At \n\nthis point resides an additional problem related to the (a priori unknown) nature of the \n\nconstitutive equations that should be incorporated into this balance law. Distinct transport \n\nmechanisms in Knudsen, viscous flow, and transition regions\n[ 210]\n\n seem to greatly difficult this \n\ntask of ascertaining the correct use of material-dependent constitutive information. Finally, \n\nadded to this is the fact that total fluxes might not be correctly (unambiguously) expressed \n\nrelative to any frame of reference\n[ 217, 218, 219, 211, 220, 221,  222, 223]\n\n, as in the case of mechanically \n\nconstrained porous membranes. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 113 \n \n\nThe drag of the moving species on the porous matrix will tend to move the membrane, \n\nunless it is mechanically constrained (i.e., unless the interphase \u201chydraulic\u201d drag is counter-\n\nreacted in some way). Assuming the porous matrix as a \u201cnon-deformable solid\u201d, it will transfer \n\nthe contact (frictional) forces to the support that ties the matrix to its surroundings. Thus, in \n\norder to the membrane remain stationary an external \u201cclamping\u201d force exerted by the supports \n\non the membrane must be applied. As a result of this force that prevents membrane \n\nmovement, there can be pressure gradients whether or not there are body forces in the fluid \n\nsystem. By their turn, these pressure gradients (or other external \u201cunbalanced forces\u201d acting \n\non the permeating gases) may cause viscous flow based on purely hydrodynamics \n\nconsiderations. Even though one can identify a \u201cviscous velocity\u201d for the mean flow (i.e., \n\nmixture\u2019s mass-average velocity), it may not be the situation for the individual viscous \n\nvelocities of the components, which are about the same only If there are no additional forces \n\nhindering their movement relative to the fixed frame of reference (e.g., adsorption forces on \n\npore walls). It comes without saying that in this case the gas-matrix (i.e., gas-wall) friction \n\nterms (\u201cKnudsen diffusivities\u201d) will determine the ratio of fluxes. \n\nHowever, in the presence of chemical reactions (occurring in the bulk volume and/or on \n\nthe surfaces of solid obstacles) the momentum balance equations do not suffice to determine \n\nthe flux ratio and supplementary information is therefore necessary, many times in the form of \n\nsecond law thermodynamic constrained inequalities, such as those derived from the linear \n\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics formalism\n[ 80, 79]\n\n (e.g., binomial combinations of \n\n\u201cthermodynamics forces\u201d and conjugated fluxes or transport rates). When chemical reaction \n\noccurs within a porous domain, is the flux ratio is determined by the stoichiometry of the \n\nreaction? Since the flux ratio determined by the stoichiometry may differ from the flux ratio \n\nrequired to satisfy the momentum governing equation at uniform pressure, internal pressure \n\ngradients may accompany chemical reactions, as suggested by Hoogschagen\n[ 214]\n\n and \n\nHaynes\n[ 212]\n\n. One can suspect that these gradients to be significant whenever chemical \n\nreactions rates are sufficiently intense (i.e., resulting in \u201clarge\u201d spatial gradients in the mean \n\ngas density) and if pore diameter is sufficiently small (i.e., resulting in appreciable rarefication \n\neffects). More precisely, if a chemical reaction (or a set of reactions) causes a net change in \n\nthe total number of moles, then it will cause a pressure gradient. In fact, this change will result \n\nin a net molar flow of gas into (or out) the domain and the pressure will be higher (or lower) \n\ninside the domain than outside. Nonetheless, additional research is required to elucidate the \n\nfactors which determine the flux ratio in these cases. Be that as it may, the effects of internal \n\npressure gradients in the porous SOFCs layers are often neglected. However, neglecting \n\npressure gradients leads to inconsistencies in the flux calculations\n[ 224, 225]\n\n and it can certainly \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 114 \n \n\nviolate mass conservation, sometimes in a very obvious manner (e.g., when mass fractions do \n\nnot add up to unity\n[ 66]\n\n). \n\nIn the general case, the species conservation equation and constitutive equations for \n\nmass diffusion flux (e.g., Maxwell-Stefan equation) must be supplemented by an equation for \n\nthe macroscopic pressure gradient in the system. The simplest (and usual) approach in the \n\nSOFC literature is to consider the total pressure constant (as will be seen in Chapter 4). \n\nHowever, as pointed out above, this alternative is inadequate if species concentrations are \n\nnon-uniform along the system. When it is considered, the establishment of a pressure gradient \n\nin the system is usually linked through the local Gibbs-Duhem equation (GDE): \n\n   ?   ( ?\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n      \n\n   \n\n)\n\n    \n\n   \n\n ?   ( ?\n   \n   \n\n    \n\n      \n\n   \n\n \n   \n  \n\n   )\n\n    \n\n   \n\n (3.74) \n\n \n\nwhere      (                   ), which thereby eliminates degrees of freedom of the \n\nsystem. That is, under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium and phase homogeneity, \n\nthe GDE places a restriction on the simultaneous variations in the intensive thermodynamic \n\nvariables of a given multicomponent phase. In principle, nevertheless, the GDE as expressed \n\nabove applies only to homogeneous macroscopic systems. For instance, the GDE does not \n\nremain valid for systems having internal state variables\n[ 151]\n\n, inhomogeneous (i.e., as in \n\nnonadditive) entropies\n[ 226, 227]\n\n, or long-range interactions\n[ 228]\n\n such as those giving rise to shear \n\nviscosity.  \n\nRigorously speaking, therefore, the GDE alone should not be used for deriving \n\nconclusions about the pressure gradient of non-equilibrium flows in porous bodies\n[ 229]\n\n. Even if \n\nthe GDE is valid under the assumption of local equilibrium, the pressure term that appears in \n\nthis equation cannot be unambiguously identified with the macroscopic pressure gradient from \n\nthe momentum (\u201chydrodynamic\u201d) balance equation.  Instead, it compares with a local gradient \n\nthat is only valid (i.e., properly defined) within the considered infinitesimal finite-volume. Similar \n\ncriticism has been already suggested by Truesdell\n[ 230]\n\n for multicomponent diffusion theories \n\nbased on TIP.  \n\nThe ambiguity concerning the use of GDE in the TIP formalism dates back to the work \n\nof Prigogine\n[ 159]\n\n, more specifically \u201cPrigogine\u2019s theorem on the independence of the (entropic) \n\ndissipation function on the choice of reference velocity\u201d, a result that was further noted by \n\nLightfoot\n[ 163]\n\n. In this particular context, the GDE has been used \u201cto prove\u201d that the summation \n\nof so-called \u201cdiffusion driving force\u201d over all mixture components is identically zero in all \n\ndomain interior points. Krishna and other authors\n[ 64, 65, 185, 65, 231, 232]\n\n, in their derivations of \n\nMaxwell-Stefan equations, have also implicitly assumed that the pressure gradient as defined \n\n\n\nChapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 115 \n \n\nby GDE is valid in the condition of \u201cmechanical equilibrium\u201d, that is, when the sum of pressure -\n\ndriven forces and body forces acting on the fluid per unity mass (or volume) is vanishing \n\nsmall\n11\n\n. These controversial derivations also convey ambiguity and can result in misleading \n\nconclusions about the validity of Maxwell-Stefan equations. Moreover, in the presence of \n\nexternal forces (such as those stemming from the mechanical restraint a membrane) the \n\nentropic dissipation function depends explicitly on the mass-average (center-of-mass) velocity \n\nand thus the reference velocity for diffusive fluxes cannot be chosen arbitrarily, making \n\nPrigogine's theorem invalid\n[ 219, 217 229]\n\n. \n\nThe short essay that has been presented in the preceding pages, besides expressing \n\nthe author\u2019s academic opinion on the phenomenological modeling of mass diffusion in \n\nmulticomponent fluid systems, is so provided to put into perspective the content of Chapter 4 \n\n(specially the models representing the diffusive mass transfer within porous SOFC layers). As \n\nnone of the topics analyzed and evaluated in the present section will be covered in the \n\nremaining parts of this work, with the exception of what is examined in \u00a7\u00a7A.5 (see APPENDIX \n\nA), it is important to make the following clarifications: \n\nI. Most (if not all) mass transfer models in Chapter 4 are theoretically flawed in \n\ntheir very core. Nevertheless, they may be (and, in fact, they are) still \n\nsuccessfully used in the numerical simulation of SOFC devices, but solely based \n\non their verifiable empirical consequences. Thus, \u201cerrors\u201d and limitations \n\nmentioned in this section do not, in general, invalidate these phenomenological \n\nmodels from a pragmatic standpoint.  \n \n\nII. However, even though these mass transfer models have been \u201csafely\u201d applied in \n\nthe simulation of solid-oxide fuel cells, in what conditions these models can in \n\nfact be used remains a problematic and critical issue. That is, it remains unclear \n\nwhat their applicability limits are and so remain their trust-regions, whose \n\nknowledge is necessary to establish confidence in the results of numerical \n\nsimulations. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n11\n\n It is worth noting that shear stresses terms have not appeared during their derivations and no reasons were \nprovided for such omission. \n\n\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1 6, 17, 18 , 19, 20, 2 1, 22, 23 , 24, 25, 2 6, 27, 2 8, 29, 30, 31, 32, 3 3, 34, 35 , 36, 37, 3 8, 39, 40 , 41, 42, 4 3, 44, 4 5, 46, 47, 48, 49, 5 0, 51, 52, 53, 54, 5 5, 56, 57 , 58, 59, 6 0, 61, 6 2, 63, 64, 65, 66, 6 7, 68, 69, 70, 71, 7 2, 73, 74 , 75, 76, 7 7, 78, 7 9, 80, 81, 82, 83, 8 4, 85, 8 6, 87, 88, 89 , 90, 91, 9 2, 93, 9 4, 95, 96, 97, 98, 9 9, 100, 1 01, 102 , 103, 1 04, 105, 106, 10 7, 108, 1 09, 11 0, 111, 1 12, 113 , 114, 1 15, 116, 117, 11 8, 119, 1 20, 12 1, 122, 1 23, 124 , 125, 1 26, 127, 128, 12 9, 130, 1 31, 13 2, 133, 1 34, 135 , 136, 13 7, 138, 139, 14 0, 141, 1 42, 14 3, 144, 1 45, 146 , 147, 14 8, 149, 150, 1 51, 152, 15 3, 154, 155, 15 6, 157, 1 58, 15 9, 160, 1 61, 162 , 163, 16 4, 165, 166, 16 7, 168, 1 69, 17 0, 171, 1 72, 173 , 174, 17 5, 176, 177, 17 8, 179, 1 80, 18 1, 182, 1 83, 184, 185, 18 6, 187, 188, 18 9, 190, 1 91, 192 , 193, 1 94, 195, 196, 19 7, 198, 1 99, 20 0, 201, 2 02, 203 , 204, 2 05, 206, 207, 20 8, 209, 2 10, 21 1, 212 , 213, 214, 2 15, 21 6, 217, 2 18, 219 , 220, 22 1, 222, 223, 22 4, 225, 2 26, 22 7, 228, 2 29, 230 , 231, 23 2  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn general terms, modeling techniques aim to obtain some sort of representation, \n\nusually of mathematical form, of the state of a natural system. The result of mathematical \n\nmodeling is the description of multiphysics processes (i.e., a description about how the natural \n\nworld is believed to function) using a set of concise mathematical concepts and rules. It is \n\nhoped that the model may help to explain and also make \u201cpredictions\u201d about the behavior of \n\nthe natural system, especially when studying the effect of changes in influential factors or \n\ncomponents of this system.  \n\nMathematical modeling can be utilized as either a theoretical or working tool\n[ 233]\n\n. The \n\nlatter is mostly concerned with quantitative models (usually to support some kind of decision \n\nmaking), while the former is more comprehensive in scope, also including process qualitative \n\naspects. Qualitative aspects are central, for example, when one is interested in developing a \n\nscientific understanding of the intricacies of multiphysics processes, rather than to only \n\naccurately quantify them. There is a wide spectrum of modeling techniques, thus aprioristic \n\nclassification of all these techniques, in pre-determined groups, is to some extent subjective \n\nand views about such classification may differ amongst different authors\n[ 234]\n\n.  In this work, \n\nnotably, a simple classification is proposed (see Fig. 4.1) to highlight the goal of a given \n\nmathematical model. This classification involves the so-called \u201cwhite-box\u201d and \u201cblack-box\u201d \n\nmodels, so referred to as \u201cphysical modeling\u201d and \u201cempirical modeling\u201d, respectively.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

These models, allegedly, often lead to the most general description of \n\nmultiphysics processes. However, there are critical elements of compromise in such modeling \n\napproach. The majority of natural systems are far too complicated to model in their entirety, \n\nthus in practice white-box models demand comprehensive interdisciplinary scientific research, \n\noften resulting in very complex mathematical descriptions. Therefore, when applying white -box \n\nmodels, the first kind of compromise is to identify the most relevant parts of the system that will \n\nbe included in the model and what will be wisely disregarded. The second kind of compromise \n\nconcerns the amount of mathematical manipulation (computation) which is feasible under \n\ncertain established criteria (e.g., simulation runtime, computer memory usage, and so on). \n\nAlthough physically-based models have the potential to provide more general results, these \n\nresults do not come without additional costs, such as the development of more robust, reliable, \n\nand complex numerical methods.  \n\nMathmatical Modeling \n\nAs a Theoretical Tool \n\n\"White box' models \n\n(mostly physical modeling) \n\nSingle Scale Models  \n\nAnalytical Modeling (\u00a7\u00a74.3, \u00a7\u00a74.4) \n\nMacro-Homogenous Approach (\u00a7\u00a74.5) \n\nMesoscale and Beyond (\u00a7\u00a74.6) \n\nMultiscale Models \n\nMacroscale Models Informed by  \n\nMicroscale Correlations (\u00a7\u00a74.7) \n\nMacroscale Models Informed by  \n\nMicroscale Simulations (\u00a7\u00a74.8) \n\nBlack box models \n\n(mostly empirical modeling) \n\nAs a Working Tool \n\n\"Black box\" models \n\n(mostly empirical modeling) \n\nSystem-Level Models \n\nUnivariate (\u00a7\u00a74.2) \n\nMultivariate (\u00a7\u00a74.2) \n\n? dynamic modeling and predictive \n\ncontrol (plant operation) \n\n? system optimization \n\n? off-design models \n\n- Micro-Macro-Homogenized Approach \n\n- Hybrid Models \n\n- Bridging Scale Methods \n? understand the intricacies of multiphysics processes \n\n? parametric optimization of single parts of SOFC \n\n? design-point models \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 118 \n \n\nModels are classified as \u201cblack-box\u201d when the state of a system is not known and its \n\nbehavior is described through a collection of input data (\u201cwhat influences the system behavior\u201d) \n\nand output data (\u201cthe resulting behavior of the system\u201d). Historical data are used to develop \n\nmodels that can describe the dependencies between input and output data. Data sets usually \n\nconstitute empirical information, but it may not always be the case (e.g., part of the data could \n\nbe obtained with help from physical modeling). In this sense, black-box models departures \n\nfrom the purely theoretical description of a process. Black-box models are frequently used as \n\nthe basis for predictive control and dynamic optimization of industrial-scale systems due to \n\ntheir relatively cheap computation effort and simple mathematical structures, which are used to \n\nsolve the problem in question (i.e., processing inputs and predicting outputs). \n\nThe goal of the present work is to analyze physical modeling techniques. Thus, reviews \n\nabout black-box models will be touched on very briefly. By the expression \u201ctypical modeling \n\ntechniques\u201d it is meant the most representative (white-box) models applied in the SOFC \n\nliterature. Certainly it would be impossible to include all modeling techniques presented to \n\ndate, and this would be a meaningless task as well, given that the content of this dissertation \n\nwill inevitable age from the moment it is published. The following critical review should help \n\ndrawing some general ideas about what delineates the fine lines separating judicious \n\nsimplifications (when the most relevant parts of the system are correctly identified) from \n\n\u201ctheoretical fantasies\u201d (when such identification is misleading). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTraditional SOFC models proved of little use for power plant modeling\n[ 235]\n\n, mainly \n\nbecause most of the effort has been devoted to depict the intricacies of primordial microscale \n\nelectrochemical processes that occur on electrode surfaces. Thus, significantly less attention \n\nwas directed to the development of system-level models. Furthermore, traditional models often \n\nrevel themselves overly sensitive to minute changes in parameters, which makes them \n\nunsuitable for distinguishing between \u201cdesign point\u201d and \u201coff-design\u201d operation of specific plant  \n\ncomponents, hindering the overall process of system optimization\n[ 235]\n\n.  From the engineering \n\npoint of view, when developing models for power plant modeling purposes, the critical \n\nrequirement is to have a mathematical model which gives reasonable results, and can be \n\nused, with the required confidence level, for design and device selection purposes. \n\nPhenomena occurring on electrode surfaces, although important, must not take up an \n\ninordinate amount of attention\n[ 235]\n\n. Moreover, these small scale phenomena are difficult to \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 119 \n \n\nmeasure and, as a result of this, large sets of experimental data are seldom available. For \n\nindustrial-scale systems, however, a mathematical model is worth little without reliable \n\nvalidation and thus hard experimental data are mandatory. \u201cHard data\u201d are those whose \n\nexperiment offers both a complete narrative about experimental procedures and detailed \n\ninformation on operating parameters. Especially for fully-empirical black-box models, the lack \n\nof reliable data undermines any serious attempt of validation.  \n\nSystem-level models represent a significant simplification when compared to more \n\ncomplex physically-based modeling approaches. Their simplicity comes from the fact that they \n\ncan use simpler \u201cprocessing rules\u201d (applied to a large collection of data sets). Another \n\nadvantage of these system-level (black-box) models is that they can create functional relations \n\nbetween inputs and outputs solely on the basis of experimental data, ignoring \n\nphenomenological approaches. Therefore, fully-empirical models can be implemented in those \n\ncases where physical models are inexistent or are unfeasible for practical reasons. A notorious \n\ndrawback is that fully-empirical models are able to \u201cdetect\u201d only those dependencies that are \n\nalready present in the data used to develop the processing rules, thus precluding any general \n\ndescription of such dependencies\n[ 235]\n\n. To tackle this problem, at least partially, one can \n\ncombine modeling through \u201cfirst-principles\u201d and data-based approaches\n[ 44]\n\n. There are a \n\nnumber of works in the SOFC literature that applied pure (data-based) black-box models, or a \n\ncombination of these with ad hoc physical modeling techniques, to support analysis at the \n\nsystem level. In these works, the system under study considered either only the fuel cell stack \n\nor the entire SOFC module, which further included BOP components (e.g., anode recycle \n\nplenum; pre-reformer; ejectors; compressors; turbines; and heat exchangers). These system-\n\nlevel models have been most often used to: (i) optimize SOFC designs under steady-state \n\nconditions; (ii) estimate SOFC state during transient operation, i.e., track the profile of \n\noperating variables during step changes in the cell current density, or in other input \n\nparameters; and (iii) dynamic modeling for predictive control purposes. In this context, some \n\nselected works of the literature will now be briefly reviewed. \n\nMilewski and coworkers\n[ 235, 236]\n\n applied the artificial neural network (ANN) model to \n\nsimulate the SOFC parametric behavior, merely utilizing available experimental data (i.e., in \n\nthis case the ANN was implemented as a fully-empirical model). Potentially, analyses based \n\non the results obtained could then be used to optimize the SOFC design. However, in this work \n\nthe objective was only to analyze the effects of various (operating and design) parameters, \n\nsuch as: fuel flow; fuel utilization factor; diluents types and their concentration; oxidant flow; \n\noxidant utilization factor; and cell operating temperature. The testing apparatus was a single \n\nplanar stack installed in a heated ceramic furnace. The investigated cell was a circular type \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

The ANN model\n[ 237, 238]\n\n is based on the so-called \n\nmethods of artificial intelligence (AI) that, in rough terms, try to imitate the methods of data \n\nprocessing of living organisms in order to describe phenomena of interest\n[ 239]\n\n. The application \n\nof AI methods to solve engineering and scientific problems is a result of the emergence of a \n\nnew research field called \u201cempirical modeling and data mining\u201d, which brings together \n\ncomputational intelligence, statistics, and numerical methods. This field is also referred to as \n\n\u201csoft-computing\u201d\n[ 240, 241]\n\n. The model developed by Milewski and coworkers to simulate a SOFC \n\nprovides an alternative to overcome the limitations of simple linear physical models, which do \n\nnot enable accurate quantitative description (although they can qualitatively capture the main \n\nfeatures) of highly nonlinear physical phenomena. Such limitations are more acute when the \n\nsystem under analysis has multiple inputs (parameters and/or variables), as in Fig. 4.2. Even \n\nthough ANN models use computationally simple methods to build dependencies between \n\ninputs and outputs, they have good nonlinear properties and thus are capable of identifying \n\npossible solutions with relative easiness, when compared to physical modeling approaches (for \n\nsystem-level problems, at least). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2: ANN is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons, which mimics the \nbehavior of human brain.

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 121 \n \n\nA hybrid model was also implemented by Milewski et al.\n[ 235]\n\n, consisting of an ANN \n\nmodel and mathematical expressions (phenomenological models) for some input parameters \n\n(see Fig. 4.2c). Through this model, Milewski and coworkers investigated various input \n\nparameters, one by one, and one of these models was created with 12 input parameters and \n\none output (see Fig. 4.2c). One may refer to the latter case as univariate modeling in respect \n\nto outputs. These authors utilized 31 voltage-current curves (comprising over 580 experimental \n\npoints) to train a network wherein the cell voltage was the only output parameter. The network \n\nwas trained until it learned the experimental data within a maximum acceptable error level. \n\nNote that large data sets are required for both ANN training and final model validation.  \n\nAvailable experimental data can teach ANNs about the global effect regarding certain \n\nparameters that impose concentration losses to a SOFC, such as anode porosity and fuel \n\ndilution (see Fig. 4.3). However, ANN models are unable to provide any direct discrimination of \n\nassociated voltage drops that are related to this or that type of polarization, among which is the \n\nconcentration polarization. The process\u2019s phenomenology is \u201chidden\u201d by processing rules, \n\nwhich are, by their turn, built within the various neuron layers. In other words, cause -effect \n\nrelations are not unambiguous, even when evaluating one parameter at time. Thus, at first, \n\nconventional ANN models are not suited to study the inner structures of multiphysics \n\nprocesses. This is not a problem, if one applies black-box models considering the objectives \n\nalready set out above for system-level models. ANN models can also be used to \u201cextend the \n\nrange of experimental results\u201d and additional data so obtained could be used as a reference \n\nfor comparison by physical modeling approaches.

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 122 \n \n\nOther types of data-based modes have been developed for SOFCs. Firstly, there are \n\nthose which are combined with ad hoc physical models and thus take into consideration more \n\ndetails of chemical and thermal aspects, requiring the solution of a set of nonlinear ODEs\n[ 242, \n\n243, 244]\n. In the most common situation, these physics-based models are zero-dimensional or \n\nquasi-1D models of fuel cell system components\n[ 245, 246, 247, 248]\n\n.  Secondly, there are dynamic \n\nmodels that are mostly data-based and developed through a system identification approach\n[ 44, \n\n249\n]. These data-based dynamic models can be used to investigate responses of SOFCs under \n\ndifferent operating conditions and then, by means of optimum control, one can steer the \n\noperating conditions towards a more favorable operating point (\u201coff-design\u201d condition), so to \n\nimprove durability and efficiency of fuel cells\n[ 44]\n\n. Process modeling, state estimation, and \n\ndesign of the controller itself are part of advanced processes control strategies. They are \n\nintrinsically dependent on each other, insofar as the model development affects both the \n\ndesign of the controller and selection of state estimation techniques. In general, data-based \n\nmodes are most useful for controller design purposes. Both advanced controls (e.g., nonlinear \n\nmodel predictive controller) and conventional controls have been implemented in SOFC power \n\nsystems.  \n\nThere is no point in discussing data-based models any further, as this would not benefit \n\nthe main goal of this work. Nonetheless, one final remark can be made about physics-based \n\nmodel-predictive control of SOFCs. The key point of these models is that they try to \n\nincorporate physical knowledge about SOFC behavior into real-time MIMO (multiple-input and \n\nmultiple-output) process-control strategies. More precisely, the controller includes some \n\n(reduced) form of a \u201chigh-fidelity\u201d, physics-based model that represents physical-chemical \n\nprocesses. However, because such complex nonlinear model cannot be solved in real time, as \n\npart of the controller logic, linear reduced-order state-space models are required. The model \n\nreduction is accomplished via system identification, which is the data-based part of the \n\nmodeling technique. Before this reduction step, one needs to first select a simplified (\u201clumped\u201d) \n\nphysical model to describe the mass diffusion of gas-phase species. The next step consists in \n\nderiving a transfer function (Laplace transform) of the chosen mass transport equation and \n\nthen to incorporate it into the set of time-dependent ODEs that represent the overall mass \n\nbalance, which is written in a format suitable for process control purposes (i.e., a model which \n\napproximates derivatives of input variables from measurable variables). Ultimately, the \n\nobjective is to design controller input signals in terms of the partial pressures of gas-phase \n\nspecies\n[ 250]\n\n, as exemplified on Fig. 4.4. Thus, physics-based model-predictive control is more \n\nabout the method of deriving state functions and establishing a control strategy, and much less \n\nabout the fidelity of physical models. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

This model was developed to control the stack terminal \n\nvoltage of a SOFC system, according to Eq. (2.21). The submodel applied for the concentration polarization       \nis given by equations Eq. (2.37) and (2.38). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe analytical modeling of SOFCs aims to find analytical solutions to fundamental \n\nproblems, ranging from single-cell performance to stack operation analysis. According to \n\nKulikovsky\n[ 12]\n\n, this approach uses \u201csimplified\u201d models based on idealized systems, basic \n\ngeometries, and \u201cminimal\u201d assumptions, enabling the qualitative understanding of the causes \n\nand effects of important phenomena that take place in fuel cells. \n\nEquations describing SOFC physicochemical processes are often overly complicated \n\nand, in general, only numerical solutions are possible. The SOFC literature on numerical \n\nsimulations is the prevailing trend today and the number of publications has been increasing \n\nvigorously in recent years, at the pace in which the complexity of mathematical models also \n\ngrows. Notwithstanding the many positive features provided by numerical simulations, the \n\nresulting information from such simulations is intrinsically limited in certain aspects. For \n\ninstance, a numerical solution represents only a subset amongst the many soluti ons to the \n\nsystem of equations, and there are undoubtedly several other possible solutions in the \n\nmultidimensional space of parameters determining the SOFC operation. Thus, if any \n\nmeaningful parameter is changed then, in principle, another numerical solution is required \n\nbefore one could draw general conclusions. As the number of parameters can be quite large \n\nand each numerical calculation can constitute time-consuming tasks, a comprehensive \n\nparametric study through numerical simulations would be indeed a herculean effort.

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 124 \n \n\nother hand, analytical solutions resulting from a suitable (carefully chosen) model can show the \n\nexplicit parametric dependency, a \u201cgeneral behavior\u201d that can be inferred from closed-form \n\nmathematical expressions. Because these solutions offer a transparent view into how \n\nvariables/parameters and interactions between variables/parameters affect the result, they \n\nmay significantly facilitate the understanding of SOFC processes. Furthermore, sometimes \n\nthey can even predict novel effects affecting cell performance\n[ 251, 252]\n\n or can be used to \n\npinpoint inconsistent results of a specific mathematical model\n[ 253]\n\n. \n\nThe models in this section are based on similar considerations as those of the models \n\nthat will be reviewed in \u00a7\u00a74.5: considerations that stem from a macro-homogeneous approach. \n\nHowever, mathematical models in \u00a7\u00a74.5 are \u201cmathematically more complex\u201d, and for this \n\nreason they will almost invariably require numerical solutions. More importantly, they do not \n\nshare the same specific goals of analytical models.  Although this will be further explored in the \n\nnext section, a few words about the macro-homogeneous approach may be instructive before \n\nproceeding to the discussion of analytical models. This approach, roughly speaking, \u201cignores\u201d \n\nthe microscopic details of SOFC porous layers, which are now considered as a \u201cnew \n\ncontinuum\u201d (i.e., as an \u201cinterpenetrating continuum media\u201d) with \u201chomogenized\u201d or lumped \n\nproperties, which are usually taken from experiments or from microstructural models. Even \n\nthough the macro-homogeneous approach has no convincing physical justification (it is a \n\nmathematical construct, after all), theoretical results obtained through this approach, within \n\ncertain restrictions, have been validated by experimental data with reasonable agreement \n\nbetween them. Nonetheless, it does have limitations and they are plentiful, as will be examined \n\nmore closely in this chapter. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe main features of the active layer of a SOFC have been already succinctly \n\ndescribed in in \u00a7\u00a72.3.3. Here a simplified mathematical model for this layer is presented, which \n\ninvestigates the effects of mass-transport on an electrochemical reaction obeying either Tafel \n\nor Butler-Volmer kinetics. To this end, the model of Perry\u2013Newman\u2013Cairns\n[ 104]\n\n was \n\ngeneralized by Kulikovsky\n[ 12, 107]\n\n to investigate the active layer (see Fig. 2.10) of an generic \n\nelectrode (anode or cathode), considering the situations of ideal ionic transport and/or ideal \n\ngas mass transport. Kulikovsky has also incorporated further simplifications to contrast a \n\nnumber of limiting cases that are encountered at high or low current density regimes. Despite \n\nthese simplifications (some of them are clearly unrealistic for real SOFCs), this model gives a \n\nreasonable account of the qualitative aspects of the problem, without inordinate mathematical \n\ncomplications. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 125 \n \n\nIn the specific case of Kulikovsky\u2019s analytical models, a more detailed examination was \n\ngiven in this dissertation (see APPENDIX A) not because these models strictly fit the \n\nobjectives of the present work, but because their analytical nature allow pinpointing, in a clear \n\nand general way, the definitions of \u201cactivation polarization\u201d and \u201caugmented polarization\u201d (as \n\nalready examined in \u00a7\u00a72.3.1-\u00a7\u00a72.3.4). However, the lengthier discussion was left to the \n\nappendix section to maintain the argumentation flow of this chapter leaner. By way of example \n\nof what ought to be criticized, Kulikovsky considers simplifying assumptions t hat do not hold for \n\nSOFCs, such as disregarding (as a general case) the importance of steam in anode kinetics. \n\nKulikovsky tries to substantiate this assumption by citing one very specific reference\n[ 254]\n\n and \n\nthen clamming that \u201cthe modeling study indicates that the water concentration dependence is \n\nweak and to a first approximation it can be ignored\u201d (see [ 255], pp. 6687). Although \n\nsimplifications such as this may well fit the goals of an analytical model (of qualitative, almost \n\ndidactical character), the argumentative strategy seems fallacious because that author tries to \n\nbestow upon the model a greater generality than can be justified based on its original premises \n\nor beyond over-simplistic arguments (unreasonable assumptions). Surely one can treat \n\ncomplex problems as if they were much simpler than they really are, but the limitations and \n\n\u201cpitfalls\u201d of such simplified treatment must be duly informed. Modeling generalizations are \n\nundoubtedly of great value, but they come at a \u201ccost\u201d and what \u201ccost\u201d this is should be assed \n\nwith fair-mindedness. \n\nKulikovsky derived analytical models for the particular cases of ideal ionic transport and \n\nideal gas transport, and for each of these cases the limiting situations of high and low current \n\ndensity were considered for further simplifications. Kulikovsky starts with the following system \n\nof equations, which governs the active layer performance (see APPENDIX A): \n\n       \n\n  \n= ?  \n\n  (       ? )\n \n[exp     ?  ? exp ?    ?  ] = ?2   \n\n  (       ? )\n \n         ?

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 126 \n \n\nAccording to Kulikovsky, Eq. (4.1) expresses the decay of ionic current with   at a rate \n\ngiven by Butler\u2013Volmer electrode kinetics (RHS of this equation); Eq. (4.2) states that Ohm's \n\nlaw is valid for the electrolyte phase, relating the ionic current to the overvoltage gradient ; it is \n\na material balance that establishes that the local diffusion flux of feed gas is equal to the local \n\nelectronic current density (  =  ?    ) to be converted through the half-cell electrochemical \n\nreaction (molar flux of ions to be converted into free electrons); and the stoichiometry factor \n\n     in Eq. (4.3) does the conversion of current density to molar flux. In order to solve the \n\nproblem, Kulikovsky nondimensionalized Eq. (4.1), (4.2), and (4.3) by using the following \n\ndimensionless variables and characteristic scaling parameters: \n\n ? =\n \n\n  \n ,  ? =\n\n \n\n   \n ,  ? =\n\n   \n\n  \n ,  ?  =\n\n      \n       \n\n (4.4) \n\n \n\nwhere    is the feed gas concentration at the active layer/outlet layer interface (   ? = 1, as per \n\nFig. 2.10). The subscripts \u201c0\u201d and \u201c \u201d mark the values at  ? = 0 and  ? = 1, respectively. With \n\nthese variables, equations are now written as \n\n   \n  ?  \n  ?\n\n= ?( ?  ?   ? )\n \n     ? (4.5) \n\n \n\n  ? = ?\n  ?\n\n  ?\n (4.6) \n\n \n\n ? \n  ?\n\n  ?\n=  ? ?   ?

This parameter \n\nindicates, under ideal transport conditions of gas species, how deep the electrochemical \n\nreaction penetrates into the electrode (see APPENDIX A and \u00a7\u00a72.3.3).

From the point of \n\nview of SOFC electrochemical performance, the polarization curve of the active layer, \n\nexpressed though the relation  ?0 =  ?0   ?, is what constitutes our main interest when it is \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

The \u201ctotal\u201d \n\nvoltage loss (polarization) is given by the value of  0 at the active layer/electrolyte interface. \n\nThe shape of the reaction rate,   \n    , is also relevant in that it might support the optimization of \n\ncatalyst design (e.g., load distribution in terms of   c  . cm ) within the electrode \n\nAnalytical solutions for the system (4.5)-(4.7) are as yet unknown. Nevertheless, for the \n\nlimiting cases of ideal ionic transport or ideal gas transport explicit analytical solutions can be \n\nderived. In Fig. 3.1 it is shown an example of solution for the case of ideal ionic transport (\u201cgas \n\ndiffusion-limited case\u201d), whereas in Fig. 3.2 it is shown the case of ideal gas transport (\u201cionic \n\nconduction-limited case\u201d). As discussed in APPENDIX A, in both cases an \u201cundisclosed \n\nassumption\u201d was made by that Kulikovsky, that the electronic phase of the composite \n\nelectrode is a perfect conductor. Such assumption can be considered a very good \n\napproximation in macroscopic modeling of high-temperature SOFCs (see also \u00a7\u00a72.3.2 and \n\n\u00a7\u00a72.3.3). Also in APPENDIX A, it is shown that Kulikovsky\u2019s model for the case gas diffusion-\n\nlimited case (which is used to evaluate the concentration polarization of a single-cell) is in \n\nerror, restricting its application to very low current density values. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1: diffusion-limited case: profiles of the ionic current density   ? , feed gas concentration  ?, \novervoltage  ?, and the rate of electrochemical conversion  ?   within the active layer.

At first, one would expect as sufficient condition for the approximation \n\nof ideal gas transport that the gas diffusivity should tend to infinity (   ). However, at least \n\ntheoretically, the contribution of gas transport to the cell voltage loss might be neglected if\n[ 12]\n\n \n\n ?   ? =  ?

In this \n\nmodel, the active layer was modeled applying the analysis described in \u00a7\u00a74.3.1, but in an \n\nintegral form, i.e. with already-integrated forms of the governing equations (thus without \n\nresolving the state variables along the electrode thickness). For this reason, the model may be \n\nreferred to as a quasi-2D model, because the problem is not solved for simultaneous \n\nequations in both spatial directions (gas channel flow direction and cell thickness direction). \n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nj eta S\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nj eta S\n\n????? , ??? \n\n? ?  42.4 \n\n? ???  \n\n? ?  12.2 \n\n??? ????? ? ??? \n\n? ? ??, ??? \n\n??? ????? ? ??? \n\n(a) (b) \n\n? ???  \n\n????? ????? \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 129 \n \n\nThis model will be addressed in \u00a7\u00a74.10.2 as it is more properly regarded as a model for the \n\nreactor flow arrangement. As will be seen therein, a critical error exists in Kulikovsky\u2019s model. \n\nMore precisely, there is an erroneous assumption concerning the equipotential condition in the \n\nstreamwise direction of the cell. \n\nMore recently, a similar model to the one developed for a planar SOFC has been \n\napplied by Kulikovsky\n[ 251, 256]\n\n to study the aging processes occurring non-uniformly along the \n\ncathode of a PEM fuel cell. Among the factors that could distort the optimal profile of the local \n\ncurrent, thereby affecting the cell polarization curve, Kulikovsky dicussed the role of oxygen \n\neffective diffusivity variation along the gas channel in lowering the cell limiting current density.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nApplication of analytical models in parametric modeling and extraction of \n\nphysicochemical parameters from experiments is ubiquitous in the literature. Not only in SOFC \n\nresearch but probably in all scientific research fields that use mathematical modeling with \n\nsome sense of practicality. The reason for that is evident: more often than not, relating the \n\nvarious essential quantities by \u201claws of nature\u201d requires, first, that these quantities are \n\nidentified by observation, experiment, and a posteriori verification. Cases wherein such \n\nrelations are predicted theoretically prior to its experimental observation are less likely to \n\nhappen. \n\nIn SOFC research there are many examples of this sort, where different measurement \n\ntechniques and mathematical models have been applied to estimate a multitude of \n\nphysicochemical parameters. Examples vary from physics-based approaches to purely \n\nempirical-based, curve-fitting approaches (e.g., polynomial curve-fitting of experimental data, \n\nwithout regard to the particular form of the equations that describe the physics of the problem). \n\nOne of the advantages of the physics-based approach is that it is built on the actual \n\nmechanisms involved in the electrodic phenomena. That is, by considering a credible \n\ndescription of the actual physical-chemical mechanisms, the fitting process tends to be better \n\nresolved, which tends to preclude problems such as the \u201cnon-uniqueness\u201d of the fitted solution. \n\nWhile physics-based models are capable of providing more rigorous description to the \n\nproblem in question, their numerical solution are often time-consuming, especially for \n\nmultivariable optimization problems. Thus, obtaining an analytic solution to these models \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 130 \n \n\npresents a good compromise, insofar as it can be used to interpret physical processes, while  \n\ndemanding far less computational effort. There are not as many studies in the SOFC literature \n\nfocusing on concentration losses and that make use of analytical modeling with the above -\n\nmentioned goal. Most studies that are built on analytical models aim the extraction of electro-\n\nkinetic parameters\n[ 257, 258]\n\n related to either electrochemical conversion or charge transport in \n\nion/electron conducting materials. Nevertheless, works dealing with the analytical modeling of \n\ngas diffusion in SOFCs are still numerous and representative examples will be presented in \n\nthe following (in \u00a7\u00a74.5 studies using non-analytical, physics-based approaches are reviewed). \n\n \n\n \n\nVirkar and coworkers\n[ 82, 259, 260, 261]\n\n have developed a number of parametric models \n\nbased on measurements made on cell materials and components, using traditional \n\nelectrochemical techniques such as steady-state polarization curves (e.g.,       vs.  ). The \n\nessential goal of their models is to evaluate the dependence of polarization effects on various \n\ncell parameters, for instance: feed gas composition, including the presence of diluents in the \n\nfeeding streams; operating temperature; thickness, porosity, and the tortuosity of porous \n\nelectrodes. It should be note that many of the equations in their theoretical analysis resemble \n\nthose already examined in \u00a7\u00a73.4 and which applied the concept of limiting (or \u201cshort-circuit\u201d) \n\ncurrent density (  ). In one of their papers\n1\n, the analysis of concentration polarization starts \n\nwith the following equations that govern the isothermal transport of gaseous species through \n\nporous electrodes, for a mixture of two gases (  and  ): \n\n ?? = ?             ???? ?

Button cells were fabricated with     electrolyte ( 10  m),    /    composite \ncathode ( 50  m), and   /    composite anode (having a quite large thickness  750  m). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

(4.12a) and (4.12b) (for    and   , respectively) are \n\nknown as the \u201cBosanquet formula\u201d\n[ 62]\n\n. Despite its long-standing popularity, DGM is a \n\nconceptually flawed model\n[ 211, 59, 221]\n\n that is based on a number of misleading mathematical \n\nderivations. Fortunately, for the models examined herein this will not be acritical issue as many \n\nof the conceptual inconsistencies of DGM \u201cdisappear\u201d if the pressure gradient term is dropped  \n\nout from the transport equation, a simplifying procedure that has been, in fact, applied by the \n\nauthors of the works being reviewed in this section. Although these authors state that the \n\nreason for neglecting the pressure gradient is because it is vanishing small, the actual motive \n\nis that by dropping this term analytical solutions become possible. However, the pressure \n\ngradient cannot be disregarded if chemical reactions take place (see \u00a7\u00a73.6 and \u00a7\u00a7A.5), \n\notherwise mass conservation is violated and the physical consistency of the problem being \n\nmodeled is lost\n[ 212, 214]\n\n. \n\nAccording to DGM, Eq. (4.11a) and (4.11b) are meant to include two flux contributions: \n\na diffusive flux and a \u201cviscous flux\u201d. The diffusive contribution consists of two terms; free \n\nmolecular or Knudsen \u201cdiffusion\u201d (associated with the terms   \n   and   \n\n  ); and a \u201ccontinuum \n\npart\u201d. For the experimental case under study, Virkar and cowers assumed that   \n   and \n\n  \n      \n\n   , and thus both    and    can be replaced by    \n   . That is, both    and    \n\napproach    \n    (the effective binary diffusion coefficient) as    |    1 and    |    0. Thus, \n\nthe main contribution to the total flux becomes pure \u201ccontinuum diffusion\u201d, in the words of that \n\nauthors. Thus, their analysis is based on the assumption that the dominant contribution to gas \n\ntransport through the porous electrodes is by mutual diffusion. The effective binary diffusivity \n\n(   \n   ) is given by the binary diffusivity (   ), which is multiplied by the effective porosity ( ) and \n\ndivided by the tortuosity factor\n2\n (  )\n\n[ 262]\n. On the cathode side,     refers to the binary diffusion \n\ncoefficient for a mixture of oxygen (  ) and nitrogen (  ). On the anode side,     is that for a \n\nmixture of hydrogen (  ) and steam (   ). The authors assumed that the dependence of \n\nbinary diffusion coefficient on temperature is not very strong\n3\n (     \n\n  ? ) and this \n\ndependence may be accounted for using a model based on the theory of Chapman-Enskogg\n[ \n\n263, 264]\n. \n\n                                                      \n2\n The tortuosity factor    is not to be confused with tortuosity   [e.g., see [ 262]):   =  \n\n . \n \n\n3\n This is not completely correct for polar modules such as     (e.g., see [ 264, 33]), especially at high \n\ntemperatures ( 700\u00b0C) . \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

Kim et al.\n[ 82]\n\n made a further simplification in the lines of what was briefly \n\ndescribed in \u00a7\u00a74.3.1: the model disregards the details of what happens within the active layer, \n\nwhich is approximated by an effective zero-thickness model, that is, there is the assumption of \n\na zero-dimensional surface reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This heterogeneous \n\nreaction is considered via the following boundary condition, at steady-state (see also Eq. 3.55): \n\n| ?? 2| = | ?? 2 | = 2 | ?? 2| =\n \n\n   \n  , at  = 0 (4.14) \n\n \n\nFrom this equation, one also has that  ?? 2   ?? 2 =  ??? = 0. Moreover, if the microstructure of \n\nporous electrode is not a function of position and     is composition-independent, then, after \n\nintegrating Eq. (4.13a) and (4.13b), the partial pressures of hydrogen (  2    ) and water vapor \n\n(  2     ) at the anode/electrolyte interface are given by  \n\n  2  = 0 =   2\n   \n\n=   2    =   2\n    ?\n\n?      \n     \n\n2         \n   (4.15a) \n\n \n\n  2   = 0 =   2 \n   \n\n=   2     =   2 \n     \n\n?      \n     \n\n2         \n   (4.15b) \n\n \n\nAlternatively, Kim et al. assumed that both the porosity and the tortuosity are functions of \n\nposition, but     is composition-independent, and then defined an effective anode \n\nmicrostructural multiplier as \n\n   =\n? \n\n2    \n(\n    \n\n     \n    \n\n)\n   \n\n=\n? \n\n2    \n?\n\n   \n    \n\n      \n\n   \n\n0\n\n    (4.16) \n\n \n\n    is, based on the \u201cFirst Mean Value Theorem\u201d, the average value of    \n    ?  on [0,    ].

In another \n\npaper\n[ 260]\n\n they studied SOFCs that were fabricated with interlayers in-between the anode and \n\nelectrolyte, and cathode and electrolyte (thus making two additional layers in comparison to \n\ntheir previous work). They evaluated the effect of various parameters on cell performance, \n\nnamely: electrolyte thickness, interlayer thickness, support thickness, and support porosity. In \n\nthis work, however, the authors did not apply the concept of liming current. Instead, they have \n\ncalculated the concentration polarization by using gas partial pressures directly in Eq. (2.37)-\n\n(2.38). The partial pressures at the electrode/electrolyte interface were calculated using a \n\nmodified model that accounts for the additional layer.

In their latter \n\nwork\n[ 261]\n\n, however, effective binary diffusivities       \n   \n\n and       \n   \n\n were measured in a special \n\nelectrochemical concentration cell\n[ 265]\n\n.  \n\nA number of other authors have been adopting a similar macroscopic approach to the \n\npresented above. Gopalan and coworkers\n[ 266]\n\n used the same concentration polarization model \n\nto evaluate the polarization on single-step co-fired SOFCs and to support the analysis\n[ 267]\n\n of \n\n\u201cout-of-cell\u201d measurements of   \u2013      effective binary diffusivity in the porous anodes, at \n\ndifferent temperatures. Chan et al.\n[ 268]\n\n has applied a very similar model in order to study the \n\npolarization sensitivity to the change of cell component thickness. Among the minor \n\ndifferences, the latter author did not simplify Eq. (4.20), i.e., the exponential term was kept as it \n\nis. Using a canonical Fick diffusion equation, Huang\n[ 134]\n\n has derived theoretical expressions \n\naccounting for the gas diffusion in a tubular cathode (i.e., using a cylindrical coordinate \n\nsystem), including an equation for the limiting current density, based on the same assumption \n\nfrom Virkar and other authors that, at this current level, the interfacial partial pressure o f the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

(4.15a), (4.15b), and (4.20) in the \n\nsimulation of a    -fueled planar SOFC (stack) with direct internal reforming.  Here, the \n\nauthors considered all reforming reactions to occur before the SOFC electrode.  \n\nThere are works in the literature that have also considered, at least in part, the \n\nanalytical models originally derived by Virkar and coauthors, but they introduced a number of \n\nnoteworthy modifications. Among these works, there exist those\n[ 270, 271, 272, 273]\n\n that have set \n\nout, more properly, reviews about the available models on gas diffusion and diffusivity \n\nmeasurement in porous electrodes of SOFCs. All of them perform some level of critical \n\nanalysis by comparing alternative mass transfer models, for instance: traditional Fick model; \n\nmodified Fick model (MFM); canonical Maxwell-Stefan (MSM) model; modified MSM; and \n\nDGM, among others. Finally, there are works that have discussed specific features (e.g., \n\nlimitations) of the effective porous diffusion model (EPDM) developed by Virkar and coauthors, \n\nproposing modifications and/or extensions. Some of these works are briefly considered in the \n\nfollowing paragraphs. \n\nSchmidt and Tsai\n[ 135]\n\n criticize commonly made approximations in diffusion equations, \n\nsuch as uniform total gas pressure within the anode and the assumption of zero feed gas \n\nconcentration at the anode\u2013electrolyte interface, under current saturation condition. The \n\nauthors propose a method to eliminate the latter approximation, and by doing so they claim \n\nthat physically reasonable values of tortuosity are now obtained, even at low current limit. With \n\ntheir semi-analytical model (a transcendental algebraic equation), tortuosity values can be \n\nfound from saturation currents, or vice-versa. \n\nIn order to study the effect of pressure gradient on mass transfer in an SOFC anode, \n\nGrigoruk and Kasilova\n[ 274]\n\n have developed a simplified, one-dimensional mass transport model \n\nbased on DGM, for which an analytic solution is obtained in the case wherein the fuel is not \n\ndiluted by an inert component (they consider a two-component gas mixture). In essence, this \n\nmodel is akin to that of Virkar and coworkers, with the exception that in Eq. (4.11a) and (4.11b) \n\nthe simplifying conditions    |    1 and    |    0 are not aprioristic assumed. However, \n\nGrigoruk and Kasilova have also neglected the pressure gradient in the derivation of their \n\nmathematical model and thus the claims of these authors are constructed based on \n\ncomparisons with the numerical solution of the \u201ccomplete\u201d DGM equations. Part of their model \n\ndevelopment is, therefore, based on misleading assumptions steaming from the errors of \n\nDGM. \n\nBrus et al.\n[ 275]\n\n estimated the tortuosity for SOFC anodes using an EPDM-based model \n\nand saturation (limiting) current densities as a fitting parameter. They compared the results \n\nfrom this mass transfer model with tortuosity values obtained through an alternative method, \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 138 \n \n\nwhich applied the structural analysis of a \u201creal\u201d three-dimensional sample micro-structure, \n\nreconstructed using a combination of scanning electron microscope and focus ion beam milling \n\n(FIB-SEM). Their work indicates that the EPDM has significant limitations in estimating \n\ntortuosity values for anodes running far from the current saturation condition. According to the \n\nauthors, in this condition the model requires relatively thick anode and very low concentration \n\nof hydrogen (e.g., high fuel utilization), and hence can only be used for raw estimation of \n\ntortuosity values. They claim that the main reason for the overestimation of tortuosity is the \n\nassumption of zero hydrogen partial pressure at the electrode/electrolyte interface. \n\nBao et al.\n[ 276]\n\n have developed a macroscopic model for synthesis gas (syngas) fueled \n\nSOFC anodes, including an analytical model for   /   electrochemical co-oxidation. They \n\nused an analytical approximation\n[ 277]\n\n to describe charge and mass transfer as decoupled \n\nprocesses, which can provide analytical profiles of both voltage losses and gas species \n\nconcentration along the anode thickness. In these analytical approximations, the molar fraction \n\nof feed gas is shown to be explicitly dependent on electrochemical variables. Their paper also \n\nprovided verification of modeling results with experimental measurements (see Fig. 4.3), based \n\non which the model has shown good correlation at high fuel utilization, when keeping a fixed \n\nporosity/tortuosity ratio. Differently from Virkar and coworkers\n[ 82]\n\n who have estimated the \n\nlimiting current density at the low inlet fuel concentration (20%   ), Bao et al.\n[ 276]\n\n have Instead \n\nestimated the limiting current density at high inlet fuel concentration (97% and 85%   ). \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.3: comparison between experimental       vs   curves and computations.   ?     binary system \nsimulated using analytical MSM (Maxwell-Stefan Model) with different porosity/tortuosity factor ratios, and two \nsimplified models for the fuel gas channel, namely \u201clogmean\u201d and \u201cinlet\u201d (figure reproduced from [ 276]).  \n\n \n\n0.4 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \n\n1.0 \n\nC\ne\nll\n v\n\no\nlt\na\ng\ne\n, \n?\n?\n?\n??\n [\nV\n]  \n\n3.5 1.5 2.5 4.5 1.0 0.0 0.5 2.0 3.0 4.0 \n\nCurrent density, ?

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 139 \n \n\nDrescher et al.\n[ 278]\n\n implemented a distinct approach in comparison to the ones \n\npresented above. In this work, the goal of these authors was not to study the electrochemical \n\nperformance of the SOFC, but to characterize the influence of mass transfer limitations in the \n\nmethane reforming reactivity within a   -    anode as a function of the anode thickness. \n\nMuch like as in a \u201cthought experiment\u201d where only the anode is included in the experimental \n\n\u201ccell\u201d (e.g., see similar work in [ 279]). The authors investigated structural properties of SOFC \n\nanodes through gas adsorption, diffusion, and permeation measurements, using a modified \n\nWicke\u2013Kallenbach diffusion cell\n[ 280]\n\n. More precisely, they applied the mean transport pore \n\nmodel (MTPM)\n[ 281]\n\n to correlate the measured permeation (     \n  ) with the mean transport \n\npore radius (?  ?) and the ratio of porosity ( ) to tortuosity ( ), according to Eq. (4.38). In a latter \n\npaper\n[ 282]\n\n these authors studied a complete single-cell, applying the same MTPM model and \n\nonce again focusing on the gas transport and methane reforming reactions in SOFC anodes. \n\n     \n  =\n\n \n\n  \n(\n \n\n4\n?  ?  ?  \n\n?  \n ?\n\n8  \n )  (4.38) \n\n \n\nwhere  ?  is the mean thermal velocity of the gas\n[ 281]\n\n. \n\nMore recently, an EPDM-based model was developed to account for the gas leak \n\ndiffusion-induced polarization\n[ 283]\n\n, especially for ?-SOFCs that suffer from problems related to \n\nnon-tight electrolytes. These authors have investigated, on theoretical grounds, the gas leak \n\nthrough \u201cmicrostructural flaws\u201d (cracks and pinholes) of thin electrolytes and its effects on \n\nconcentration polarization for both anodes and cathodes. They derived algebraic expressions \n\nfor the evaluation of limiting current densities and concentration polarizations, which are similar \n\nin spirit and purpose to Eq. (4.31), (4.32), and (4.34). \n\nIn short, the models reviewed in this section employ some degree of parametric \n\nmodeling through analytical solutions of governing and constitutive equations. They aim the \n\nobtainment of accurate expressions that relate the gas-phase composition at the fuel and air \n\nchannels with the composition at the three-phase-boundary, where all important \n\nelectrochemical phenomena take place. The virtue of these models are that they apply a \n\nmacroscopic approach befitting the spatial and time resolution of the available experimental \n\ninformation, thus without introducing unnecessary (often obscure) level of sophistication into \n\nthe mathematical models. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 140 \n \n\n \n\nIn \u00a7\u00a71.4.2 it was described what are the main features of a multiscale approach\n[ 1, 2]\n\n and \n\nto what extent this approach is necessary in order to accurately represent the performance of \n\nall components of a SOFC. More specifically, multiscale modeling is often needed in those \n\nproblems where single-scale models are incapable of making spatio-temporal resolved \n\nassessments of the complex interplay of competing, physicochemical microscopic processes. \n\nThat is, when the interaction of physicochemical processes on \u201cfine-scales\u201d leads to significant \n\nspatial and time heterogeneities in the state variables of interest, ultimately affecting \n\nphenomena at \u201ccoarse-scales\u201d. Furthermore, these heterogeneities happen to be very difficult \n\n(or even impossible) to model \u201con average\u201d on this \u201ccoarse-scale\u201d. Thus, the proper resolution \n\nof two or more dissimilar scales at which those processes take place becomes pivotal in \n\nselecting a modeling technique(s). In this sense, models to be described in this section are \n\nconsidered applicable to problems in which, supposedly, the \u201cmacro-averaging\u201d of the details \n\nof an underlying microscopic world is still valid or accurate enough. Before proceeding to the \n\nreview of the so-called macro-homogenous models, it is important to dedicate few words to \n\nwhat is meant when one conveniently labels a model as \u201csingle-scale\u201d or \u201cmultiscale\u201d\n[ 40]\n\n. Some \n\nwords of Fish\n[ 155]\n\n are given in this direction: \n \n\n(\u2026) Equations can be classified into two categories: those that directly follow from physical laws \n\nand those that do not. A constitutive equation demonstrates a relation between two physical \n\nquantities that is specific to a material or substance and does not follow directly from physical \n\nlaws. It can be combined with other equations to solve specific physical problems. (\u2026) \n\nPhenomenological modeling relates several different empirical observations of phenomena to \n\neach other in a way that is consistent with fundamental theory but is not directly derived from it. \n\n(\u2026) An alternative to phenomenological modeling is to derive constitutive equations (or directly, \n\nfield quantities) from finer scale(s) where established laws of physics are believed to be better \n\nunderstood. The enormous gains that can be accrued by this so-called multiscale approach \n\nhave been reported in numerous articles.  ([ 155], pp. 1-2) ? this author's emphasis in bold \n\nletters. \n \n\nTherefore, one could say that even if all governing equations (\u201cphysical laws\u201d) describe \n\nprocesses on a single-scale, if constitutive equations (or \u201cconstitutive laws\u201d\n5\n) and constitutive \n\nparameters are obtained from other scales (not necessarily from finer scales, even though this \n\nis often the case), one may refer to this combination as a multiscale approach. Under the \n\n                                                      \n5\nTerm originally coined by Walter Noll [ 419]. One could label all that one does not fundamentally know about a \n\nboundary value problem as a \u201cconstitutive law\u201d, though this may result in ambiguity. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 141 \n \n\ndefinition above, however, there is a fair dose of subjectivity in classifying a model as \u201csingle -\n\nscale\u201d or \u201cmultiscale\u201d. Firstly, because it is not the governing equations what that necessary \n\nneed to be solved on multiple scales so that the approach can be called multiscale; secondly, \n\nphenomenological constitutive equations are not necessarily macroscopic-based derivations; \n\non certain cases, one can derive phenomenological equations on finer scales as well and \n\napply them (\u201cupscaled\u201d) on coarser scales. In other words, it is not the fact that a constitutive \n\nequation is eventually based upon empirical (or numerical) observations of phenomena that \n\nmakes it \u201cnon-multiscale\u201d. One concrete example is that of phenomenological chemical \n\nkinetics (mean-field approximation) that employs Arrhenius-like exponential formulas: \n\nparameters in these formulas can be derived, for instance, from either macroscopic or \n\nmicroscopic experiments, or even from \u201cmicroscopic theories\u201d such as UBI-QEP or DFT\n[ 93]\n\n. In \n\nthe latter case, does it make the modeling technique a multiscale approach? Certainly, there is \n\na nuance in answering this question that depends on personal views/biases. \n\nIn this dissertation, specifically, gas-phase phenomena are the focus. Thus, the terms \n\n\u201csingle-scale\u201d or \u201cmultiscale\u201d will refer only to these phenomena, even if a work from the \n\nliterature may have applied multiscale techniques to other coexistent physicochemical \n\nprocesses (e.g., electrochemistry) in the same analysis. Thus, for gas-phase phenomena, \n\neither governing equations or constitutive relations must have been derived considering \n\ninformation from more than one physical scale in order to be classified as multiscale. Another \n\nexample: if transport parameters such as porosity and tortuosity (or equivalently, the effective \n\ndiffusivity) are obtained via mesoscale models, e.g. Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM), on a real \n\nporous microstructure, but afterwards macroscopic continuum equations such as Eq. (4.13a) \n\nare used, herein this technique will be referred to as multiscale. On the other hand, if the same \n\nparameters are obtained from the literature or by \u201cbest-fitting\u201d their values from macroscopic \n\nexperiment data, here this technique will be referred to as single-scale. Furthermore, just \n\nbecause macroscale-continuum equations may eventually describe simultaneous processes \n\nthat have different length and time scales (quite common in chemically reacting systems with \n\nshort-lived, intermediate chemical species), this does not make the technique multiscale (just \n\nthe problem being tacked). The assertion remains true if more equations are added to take into \n\naccount adsorption phenomenon, but they are all solved on the same macroscopic scale. As \n\nalluded to above, however, this classification is subjective and reflects the way in which the \n\nauthor decided to organize this monograph. \n\nIn the SOFC literature, most of the publications on the subject of numerical simulations \n\nare those that use single-scale, macro-homogeneous models of porous layers. The number is \n\nindeed overwhelming when compared to other modeling approaches. Without ascertaining the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 142 \n \n\nreasons for that, it is probable that macro-homogeneous models have been the best available \n\n\u201cbenefit-cost\u201d solution until recent days. It was said \u201cuntil recent days\u201d because existing \n\nresearch paradigms are now changing vigorously due to the flourishing of applied \n\nnanosciences. For instance: access to high performance computing; greater dissemination \n\n(and consolidation) of novel multiscale modeling techniques; further development of \n\ncomputational material sciences in response to the need to \u201cdesign on the nanoscale\u201d; and so \n\nforth, are factors driving several researchers towards alternative modeling approaches. As for \n\nmany things, there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solution and as necessities and/or requirements \n\nchange, solutions will get more diverse, more complex. Thus, at least two trends are likely to \n\nunfold: (i) the macro-homogeneous approach will share space with other distinct approaches; \n\nand (ii) the macro-homogeneous approach itself will get more complex; it will ameliorate due to \n\nthe demands of a better description of the microscopic world. Certainly, this approach will not \n\ndisappear. \n\nHaving said that the number of publications is enormous, it would be impossible to \n\nperform an encompassing review of all works that have been using a macro-homogeneous \n\napproach to model SOFCs. Thus, this work describes a selection of mathematical models that \n\nmay well represent the class of macro-homogeneous models for SOFCs; more precisely those \n\nconcerning gas-phase phenomena and the effects related to concentrations polarization. \n\nThere is, however, a complicating factor that can make the discussion of some models difficult. \n\nSeveral independent research groups re-develop pre-existing models from the literature, by \n\nincluding modifications to the previous model. As the implementation of the previous model \n\n(i.e., its computational source code) is not available to new researchers, these mathematical \n\nmodels are very seldom compared to each other, thereby making it impossible to assess the \n\nsignificance of the proposed modifications. Furthermore, most mathematical models in the \n\nSOFC literature do not follow thorough validation processes (e.g., get verified by third-parties). \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe expression \u201cmacro-homogeneity of field equations in an inhomogeneous \n\ncontinuum\u201d conveys at least two important assumptions. The first is that the equations being \n\nsolved disregard the microscopic details of SOFC porous layers. More precisely, constitutive \n\nequations perform an incomplete description of the real complex, inhomogeneous pore \n\nstructure, whose properties (geometric and others) are now described in a zero-dimensional \n\nspace (i.e., homogeneous). Of course, one hopes that this approach sill allows capturing the \n\nmacroscale behavior, that is, according to certain transformations it will preserve macroscopic \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 143 \n \n\nproperties. The second meaning is that the (undoubtedly discrete) porous medium is now \n\nconsidered as a \u201cnew continuum\u201d, interpenetrated with the continuum of the gas-phase. Thus, \n\nnot only thermodynamic and transport properties of the porous material are lumped because of \n\nthe homogenous assumption, but they are \u201chomogenized\u201d together with those of gas species. \n\nTo be sure, this makes one wonders about what are the practical consequences of this \n\n\u201closs of information\u201d, besides losing spatial resolution and ignoring the fluctuating part of the \n\nfields of state variables. These issues will not be addressed herein; nevertheless, at this point \n\nsome considerations are highlighted so to emphasize the limits and critical features of macro-\n\nhomogeneous models\n[ 67, 155, 284, 205]\n\n: \n\n? Although on the microscopic scale there is a \u201cwell-defined\u201d interface (whose \n\ngeometry is very complex) between the gas and pore-wall, in order to obtain \n\nresults of practical significance the macro-homogeneous model only describes the \n\nmacroscopic features of a porous electrode. That is, the model should represent \n\nsome suitable average over the random and complicated microscopic geometry of \n\nthe porous electrode and this representation should be reasonably accurate on \n\nthe macroscale. \n \n\n? Superficial current densities and species fluxes must be corrected for the specific \n\ninterfacial areas (  ) involved, or for the TPB specific length (    ), in order to \n\ncorrectly evaluate the current density or flux at a particular phase boundary. \n \n\n? One should expect macro-homogeneous models to fail when a length \n\ncharacteristic of the microstructure (e.g., pore radii) becomes comparable to a \n\nlength characteristic of the macrostructure size of the electrode (e.g., its thickness \n\nor, alternatively, the reaction penetration depth). \n \n\n? Macro-homogeneous models often consider that there is no actual variation of \n\ngas concentration across the pore diameter. This variation is usually neither \n\nexplicitly described nor accounted for at all. \n \n\n? The characteristic time for gas-phase diffusion, e.g. (    ? ? )\n \n\n   \n   ? , is usually \n\nassumed to be far more than the characteristic time for charging the double-layer \n\ncapacity, e.g. the ratio    \n             ?   1. This ratio is expected to be greater \n\nthan one for very high interfacial areas and low ionic conductivities. In HT-SOFC \n\nelectrodes, the double-layer relaxation time is in the range\n[ 8]\n\n of 10?  to 10?     . \n \n\nBased on the following review one should apprehend how, within the limits of a macro-\n\nhomogeneous approach, each model delineates its constitutive equations and parameters. \n\nThis aspect is what will, for the most part, differentiate one model from another. A n additional \n\ndifferentiation criterion is whether a multiphysics approach is used or not, e.g., if gas-phase \n\nmacro-homogeneous equations are coupled to chemical kinetics and/or to charge transport. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 144 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFerguson et al.\n[ 285]\n\n developed one of the earliest three-dimensional numerical \n\nsimulations of SOFCs, using macro-homogeneous partial-differential equations.  Their \n\nnumerical code was able to perform the computation of the local distributions of the electric \n\npotential, temperature, and concentration of the chemical species, in order to show the \n\nbehavior of these distributions when certain parameters (e.g., geometry of the cell, electrolyte \n\nmaterials, and temperature in the channels) are varied. The authors studied natural gas-fed \n\nand hydrogen-fed SOFCs under stationary regime, for different unit cell designs, such as \n\nplanar, tubular, and cylindrical geometries. For the planar concept, specifically, they have also \n\nconsidered three alternative configurations, namely co-flow, counter-flow, and cross-flow gas \n\nchannel arrangements. The aim of their work was, besides the development of the numerical \n\ncode and its validation with experimental data, to compare the cell efficiency for the cases of \n\nparallel (co-flow) and cross-flow designs; and then to assess the influence of the electrode \n\nthickness on cell efficiency. Differently from previously published works, Ferguson and \n\ncoauthors\n[ 285]\n\n have modeled the spatial variation of the cell variables within the unit cell (PEN \n\nsandwich) itself, whereas in other prior works the stack was modeled assuming the solid \n\nmaterials to be all at the same temperature and the current density being computed by \n\naveraging the conductivities of the various cell components. Ferguson and coauthors were \n\npioneers in building a two-dimensional model for the cell cross-section (which amounts to a \n\nthree-dimensional model globally).

It was assumed that in the gas channels the molar flux is mainly convective in the flow direction (Eq. \n\n[4.39e]). Diffusive mass exchange at the boundaries with electrodes where taken into account using a \nmass-transfer coefficient. However, no additional information was provided by Ferguson et al.\n\n[ 285]\n on \n\nhow this was actually accomplished. \n \n\nix. The volumetric source term  ? ,  is made up of two terms,  ?   and  ?  , which are the rates of reaction of \n\nwater gas-shift (WGS) and methane reforming reactions, respectively;   ,   and   ,   are the net \n\nstoichiometric coefficients of the species   in question in WGS and reforming reactions, respectively \n(positive for products, negative for reactants). \n\n \nOne can verify that in the species mass transport equations the nature of the porous \n\nmedium is completely absent. The single possible \u201cvestige\u201d that could indicate that a porous \n\nmedium is being modeled is the constitutive parameter   ,    in Eq. (4.39d). Nonetheless, \n\nFerguson and coauthors do not provide any information concerning this parameter, beyond \n\nsaying that it is \u201cthe diffusion coefficient of the  -th species in the considered mixture\u201d (see pp. \n\n112 in [ 285]). Most likely, this parameter was fitted from experimental data, although   ,    \n\nvalues were not made available in their paper. Furthermore, the physical definition of the total \n\nmolar flux  ???  in Eq. (4.39d) is unknown, e.g., is it a cross-section averaged, superficial flux \n\ncalculated based on the fraction of open area of porous medium?  Or is it the flux associated \n\nwith the \u201cbulk\u201d flow within the pore space?  \n\nThe model by Ferguson et al. serves the purpose of introducing one important aspect \n\nthat this dissertation tries to address: that in the SOFC literature, quite frequently, no matter \n\nhow simple or how complex, either consistent or erroneous a model may be, experimental data \n\nare always, seemingly, verified. For example, if a model has an awkwardly large number of \n\nadjustable parameters, the likelihood that this model will match empirical observations is \n\npotentially high, even though it is revealed afterwards that these fitted parameters are \n\ndisproved of physical meaning (i.e., they are \u201cfudge factors\u201d). When attributing \u201cunphysical\u201d \n\nvalues to those adjustable parameters only shows that the model is able to represent \n\nexperimental data, much like a 4th order polynomial fitting-formula would. Although the \n\npresence of a \u201clarge number of adjustable parameters\u201d is an expected characteristic of macro-\n\nhomogeneous models, when a number of works in the literature allegedly capture \u201cquasi-\n\nmicroscopic\u201d features of SOFCs electrodes using these \u201ccrude models\u201d, then the underlying \n\nreason for this successful accomplishment is not clear\n[ 58]\n\n. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 147 \n \n\nYakabe et al.\n[ 286]\n\n developed a mathematical model to simulate an anode-supported \n\nplanar (counter-flow design) SOFC. Concerning the concentration polarization, they have \n\nsimulated the three-dimensional distribution of the gaseous species for binary systems \n\n(  \u2013     and   \u2013    ) and also for  multicomponent mixtures. In this latter case, the model \n\nhas considered the use of steam-reformed methane as fuel, for which the concentration \n\npolarization, at high fuel utilization, was estimated. In order to model flow phenomena, t he \n\nauthors assumed the validity of Darcy\u2019s Law in the porous medium (to account for the \u201cviscous \n\nflow\u201d parcel and also to define a constitutive equation for the pressure gradient term) and that \n\nreactant species are transported to the electrolyte/anode interface mainly by mass diffusion. \n\nAs it seems, their analysis of multicomponent diffusive transport\n[ 287, 288]\n\n is based on certain \n\nresults derived from parallel pore models\n[ 289, 290, 213]\n\n, which by their turn rely on a number of \n\nassumptions made in the earlier versions of DGM developed by Evans and Manson\n[ 291]\n\n for \n\nbinary gas systems. Table 4.3 includes information on the mathematical model used by \n\nYakabe and coauthors. However, it should be noted already that they have provided scarce \n\ndescription about their actual CFD model (e.g., there are no explicit references to governing \n\nand constitutive equations, source terms, and boundary conditions). \n\n \n\nTable 4.3: Macro-homogeneous model from Yakabe et al.

It appears that in their model the electrochemical reactions were also assumed to occur at the \nanode/electrolyte interface (i.e. heterogeneous reactions are modeled through boundary conditions). \n \n\nii. According to the authors, concentration polarization was calculated using Eq.

Equation (4.40e) appears to be based on Wagner \nequation for the electromotive force of a galvanic cell, which has a mixed ionic-electronic conductor\n\n[ 69]\n. \n\n \n\nv. According to the authors, the experimentally measured concentration polarization (used for comparison \npurposes) was the average value over the anode (integral value over its length and thickness). \n\n \n\nYakabe and coauthors have used Eq. (4.40a) as a statement of \u201cDarcy\u2019s Law\u201d, however \n\nits role in the actual modeling scheme is not clear, in the sense that this equation requires \n\nadditional information (e.g., boundary value information, prescribed values within the physical \n\ndomain, other sub-constitutive equations, and so forth) in order to have complete physical \n\nsignificance. As it is, one has both the pressure gradient    and superficial velocity    as \n\nunknown values. For example, a possible coupling possibility between modeling equations \n\nwould be \n\n ???? = ?     \n               ??  (4.41) \n\n \n\nEven though often used in the literature, Eq. (4.41)  is not strictly correct in the \n\npresence of Knudsen or \u201cfrictional\u201d flow\n[ 211, 284]\n\n. Moreover, this formulation can lead to serious \n\ninconsistences concerning the velocity (or rather, inertial) frame of reference. Equations \n\n(4.40b) and (4.40d) also present some problems. The former is a known result from DGM valid \n\nfor isobaric counter-diffusion (hence, in this case the total pressure should be strictly uniform). \n\nThus, it is not clear in which way the authors had intended to match this equation with \u201cDarcy\u2019s \n\nLaw\u201d, which considers the total pressure to vary spatially within the porous electrode. Equation \n\n(4.40d) possesses, on the other hand, problems to enforce mass conservativity because it \n\napplies a non-conservative form of diffusive fluxes\n[ 211, 292, 303]\n\n. Finally, the use of Eq. (4.40e) to \n\nquantify the concentration polarization is at least controversial to whether it can be used to \n\nevaluate concentration losses directly. This equation really expresses the total EMF of the \n\nSOFC as expressed by, say, the Wagner equation, in that the SOFC is considered to be an \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

Yakabe and coauthors, in order to understand the effects of the \n\ngas composition and anode structure on the concentration polarization, they have compared \n\nthe calculated concentration polarizations       to that of a reference case      ,0 (see Fig. \n\n4.4), where      ,0 is the concentration polarization at the ratio   2 (  2    2 )? = 0.8 for a \n\ngas mixture present in the fuel channel (ternary   \u2013    \u2013    system). That is, in order to keep \n\nthe open-circuit voltage constant, the ratio   2   2 ?  was fixed at 0.8 0.2? , and the    \n\nconcentration in the fuel channel was modified by diluting      ?   with   . \n\n     ?      ,0 =      ?        ?      ?       0 = \n \n\n            = [\n? \n\n2 \n  (\n\n  2  2\n  ?\n\n  2 \n)]\n\n ,    \n\n?

In another study, \n\nSuwanwarangkul et al.\n[ 270]\n\n made use of the experimental values from Yakabe et al. in order to \n\ncompare different mass transfer models in SOFCs, but applying the usual definition of      , \n\ne.g. according to Eq. (2.37).  \n\n \n\nAckmann et al.\n[ 293]\n\n have presented a two-dimensional mathematical model to evaluate \n\nthe diffusive mass transport in the porous structure of thick planar substrates, which are \n\ntypically found in anode-supported SOFCS, using the MTPM\n7\n. Their aim was to examine \n\noperation conditions and the effect of the substrate structural parameters on the cell \n\nperformance, for the case of SOFCs running under methane steam reforming and water-gas-\n\nshift reactions. To justify this study, the authors have noted that, in thicker anodic substrates \n\n(1.5 mm thick, in their simulations), there can be severe diffusional limitations, which, as a \n\nconsequence, might lead to a spatial separation of reforming and electrochemical reactions, \n\nthe latter being confined to a very thin region near the anode/electrolyte interface (as \n\ndiscussed in \u00a7\u00a72.3.3). \n\nThese authors claim that their MTPM implementation has several advantages over that \n\nof Yakabe et al.\n[ 286]\n\n who used the parallel pore model (PPM). Among the claims, they state \n\nthat in the MTPM both the permeability and diffusion coefficients are calculated from structural \n\nparameters of real porous materials, all of which can be determined directly by permeatio n and \n\ndiffusion experiments in Wicke-Kallenbach cells. While it is eminently true that the mentioned \n\nstructural parameters (e.g., tortuosity, porosity, and pore radii) can indeed be experimentally \n\nmeasured with support of MTPM, accepting such statement as an advantage is a flagrant \n\nmisrepresentation. Firstly, because these parameters can also be measured using diffusion \n\nexperiments in porous solids with the aid of PPM (there is a wealthy number of examples \n\nwhere this has been done\n[ 287, 294, 289, 290, 213]\n\n). Secondly, because in their physical substance \n\nboth MTPM and PPM are \"two sides of the same coin\", that is, they are really modified \n\nMaxwell-Stefan models with their roots on the derivations due to Mason and Evans\n[ 291, 63]\n\n, \n\neven sharing the same flaws and misleading definition of fluxes.

Equation (4.43c) (a modified Maxwell-Stefan equation) is assumed to be valid in the transition region of \nKnudsen numbers (   ), wherein both effects from free molecular diffusion (\u201cKnudsen diffusion\u201d) and \nhydrodynamic (\u201cbulk\u201d) diffusion are considered, depending on, e.g., the length scale of the pores. The \nauthors have not defined how     is to be evaluated based on this length scale (see [ 281]). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

(4.43f), the permeation flux density is described by Darcy\u2019s Law. This formulation also has \ninconsistences concerning the velocity frame of reference (see [ 211, 221]). \n\n \n\nvi. In the derivation of Eq. (4.43g) there are implied assumptions regarding the rarified aspects of the flow \nand considerations on the pore geometry (see [ 281]). Apparently, this equation has a serious error in \nthe last term of RHS, which is unbounded upon summation over all k gas species. Actually however, the \nerror lies in the expression of Eq. (4.43f), from which the mole fraction (  ) of species k is missing, that \n\nis, the equation should have been written as  ???? \n    \n\n= ?        , \n   ?  ?    . \n\n \n\nvii. In Eq. (4.43h), the terms  ?    2 ,  ?    2 , and  ?       are the rates of reaction due to electrochemical \n\nreduction of oxygen, oxidation of hydrogen, and oxidation of carbon monoxide, respectively. The model \nfor the evaluation of these reaction rates was neither included nor described by Ackmann and \ncoauthors\n\n[ 293]\n; instead these authors only mention that an \u201cequivalent circuit model\u201d was employed. \n\n \n\nA prominent framework of macro-homogeneous models for SOFC porous electrodes \n\nhas been developed by H. Zhu and R. Kee (Colorado School of Mines), in cooperation with V. \n\nJanardhanan and O. Deutschman (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), and with D. Goodwin \n\n(Caltech). Their work comprehends a wide range of topics, including: models for \n\nheterogeneous chemistry (e.g., direct internal reforming of primary fuels in SOFC anodes); \n\nquasi-elementary electrochemistry models (e.g., modified Butler-Volmer equations based on \n\nelementary, single-step reactions), multicomponent mass transport models, constitutive \n\nequations to \u201cpredict\u201d properties of composite electrodes, among others. In the specific case of \n\ngas-phase mass transfer modeling, these authors are, beyond a doubt, advocators of the \n\nDusty Gas Model (GDM). Part of their published works will now be presented and succinctly \n\ndiscussed. \n\nIn one of their first papers, Zhu and Kee\n[ 138]\n\n have furnished the basic theoretical \n\nformulation to be used by mathematical models in order to represent the PEN of SOFC \n\nsystems, thereby allowing the analysis of the effects of various cell polarizations. A peculiar \n\nfeature of this work was the proposition of an \u201cabstract nomenclature\u201d for chemical reactions \n\nand chemical species, so to maintain generality in the modeling of arbitrary gas mixtures on \n\nthe anode and cathode sides of the PEN. This nomenclature is not novel in the chemical \n\nprocess modeling literature (more precisely, in the simulation of chemical kinetic systems \n\nobeying the \u201claw of mass action\u201d); this level of abstract nomenclature is often implemented in \n\nnumerical codes such as CHEMKIN software\n[ 139]\n\n.  In the same work\n[ 138]\n\n, the concentration \n\npolarization (e.g., concentration gradients stemming from the transport/reaction of gaseous \n\nspecies within porous electrodes) was evaluated with support from the DGM. A summary of \n\nthis model, as applied by Zhu and Kee, is presented in Table 4.5. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

The electrochemical reactions are assumed to occur at the anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte \ninterfaces (i.e. heterogeneous reactions are modeled through boundary conditions). At these interfaces, \nthe total molar flux is related to the electric current by Faraday's law, as per Eq. (4.44f) and (4.44g). \n \n\nii. The total molar flux is taken as zero for any inert species that does not participate in the electrochemical \nreactions (e.g., nitrogen in the cathode). \n\n \n\niii. The main DGM equation, Eq. (4.44a), expresses an implicit relationship among the molar concentrations, \nmolar fluxes, concentrations gradients, and the pressure gradient. In this equation   =   ?  ?  is the \n\ntotal molar concentration and    is a \u201cmixture viscosity\u201d, which depends on the mixture composition \nand temperature. \n\n \n\niv. Note that in Eq. (4.40b), differently from Eq. (4.40c) and (4.43d), the factor 4 3?  appears. It is not clear \nwhether this difference is related or not to some assumption concerning an extra \u201ccorrection\u201d due to, \ne.g., the accommodation coefficient of gas molecules on wall surfaces\n\n[ 295]\n. The canonical definition of the \n\ndiffusivity for Knudsen flow is obtained from the self-diffusion coefficient derived from the kinetic theory \nof gases\n\n[ 161]\n, which gives    =     ? 3? , where  ?  is the mean thermal velocity of the gas. Thus, \n\n   =  2 3?    [8 ?      ? ]\n   .  \n\n \n\nv. The Kozeny\u2013Carman relation given by Eq. (4.44d) assumes (i.e., idealizes) that the porous layer is formed \n\nby closely packed spherical particles\n[ 49]\n\n with diameter  ? . \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 154 \n \n\nCONTINUATION OF TABLE 4.5 \n\n     \nvi. In order to determine the pressure gradient term, Eq. (4.44e) is used. This expression originates from the \n\nsummation of Eq. (4.44a) over all species  , and also recognizing that the summation of the first term on \nthe RHS vanishes exactly. As electrolyte interface concentrations are initially not known, an iterative \nprocedure is employed to evaluate the pressure gradient, by first assuming an initial guess for the \nconcentrations \u201c  \u201d. Subsequently, according to the authors, the concentrations \u201c  \u201d in the denominator \nof Eq. (4.44e) are then evaluated either with values taken at the gas channel interface or at the \n\nelectrolyte interface, depending on the direction of the net molar flux ?  ????  . If this flux is toward the \nelectrolyte, then \u201c  \u201d are taken as the channel concentrations. Conversely, when the net flux is toward \nthe channel, these concentrations are evaluated at the electrolyte interface. Once the pressure gradient \nhas been determined, concentration gradients can now be obtained from Eq. (4.44a). Zhu and Kee\n\n[ 138] \n\npropose to assume linear profiles of pressure and concentrations along the electrode thickness, thereby \nsimplifying the analysis. Thus, by assuming linear concentration profiles and a known layer thickness, \nconcentration gradients are evaluated and a new estimate for the concentrations at the TPB can be \nfound. With new estimated gas concentrations, a new pressure gradient can be calculated. The Iteration \nproceeds until satisfactory convergence is achieved. \n\n \n \n\nIn a next paper, Zhu, Kee, and coauthors\n[ 83]\n\n have extended their previous \n\ncomputational framework for the modeling of chemically reacting flows in anode-supported \n\nSOFCs, considering the possibility of internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels. The framework \n\nnow incorporates the capability to represent elementary heterogeneous chemical kinetics in \n\nthe form of multistep reaction mechanisms (mean-field approximation with mass-action \n\nkinetics). The charge-transfer chemistry is modeled through modified BVEs derived from \n\nelementary reactions, but assuming a single rate-limiting step. Again, concentration \n\npolarization is accounted for by solving the mass transport in the porous electrodes using the \n\nDGM. To illustrate an application for their framework, they chose a planar SOFC in which the \n\nfuel channel had a co-flowing architecture (\u201cplug flow\u201d approximation in the mean flow \n\ndirection). However, the authors state that their theory is independent of this particular \n\ngeometry. The internal reforming model was exemplified through the case of     steam \n\nreforming on   -based catalys, whose reaction mechanism consisted of 42 reversible \n\nreactions, involving 6 gas-phase and 12 surface-adsorbed species. \n\n \n\nTable 4.6: Macro-homogeneous model from Zhu et al.

(4.45a) and (4.45b) the channel geometry is characterized by the cross-sectional area    and the \nperimeter    associated with the electrochemically active PEN. According to the Figure above,    \n\nincludes the width of the gas channel plus the width of the electrode. Here,  ?  is the total molar flux of \n\nthe  -th species evaluated at the channel/anode interface, i.e.,  ? =  ?   = 0 . \n \n\niii. To justify the PFR model for the fuel channel, Eq. (4.45a) and (4.45b), the authors consider the gas flow \ntherein to be one-dimensional and laminar. They state that this is a good approximation because fuel \nchannels typically have diameters less than a centimeter and mean velocities of less than 100 cm  . \nThus, Reynolds number is expected to be on the order of  100. Hence the flow is highly viscous and a \nfully developed velocity profile is established very near the channel entrance (see \u00a7\u00a74.10 for discussion). \n\n \n\niv. In the fuel channel, the authors also neglect variations of the gas composition transverse to the flow \ndirection, assuming that \u201crapid diffusion of species across the channel width homogenizes the \ncomposition transverse to the flow\u201d. That is, they disregard any mass transfer resistance in the wall \ndirection or, which is the same, the flow has no \u201cmass boundary layer \u201c(see \u00a7\u00a74.10 for discussion). \n\n \n\nv. It seems to be a problem with the solution of fuel channel, if one takes into consideration the statement \nmade by the authors in that the velocity   is free to vary in the channel. In this case, there are more \nunknowns than equations, i.e. the problem is under-determined (see note \u201ci\u201d in Table 4.8). \n\n \n\nvi. In the steady-state description of molar fluxes, Eq. (4.45c),  ? ,   is net production rate (per unit of active \n\narea) due to heterogeneous chemistry and     is the active catalyst area available for surface reaction per \nunit volume. The authors state that as the electrode thickness is much smaller than its length, gradients \nare primarily in the   direction (transport through the electrode is taken as approximately 1D). \n\n \n\nvii. This molar production rate  ? ,  , Eq. (4.45m), is evaluated using the proposed heterogeneous reaction \n\nmechanism in Zhu et al.\n[ 83]\n\n. Since this mechanism is formulated in terms of elementary reactions on the \ncatalyst surface, the reaction rates depend both on the concentrations of the gaseous reactants and on \nthe coverages of the surface species, the latter represented by surface sites and adsorbates. Since these \ncoverages are not known a priori, they must be determined as part of the solution process. However, the \nway in that this is accomplished is not indicated in their paper. It is likely that a \u201cpseudo-transient\u201d \nconservation equation for surface species was added to the set of equations.  \n\n \n\nviii. The authors assume that surface species are effectively immobile on length scales larger than an \nindividual catalyst particle. Thus, at steady state, values of  surface coverage must be such that the net \n\nproduction rate due to chemistry is zero for every surface species (i.e.,  ? ,  = 0 when   is a surface \n\nspecies). Evidently, this is a corollary assumption within the mean-field approximation, but it does not \nmean it is a good approximation for the real problem being solved\n\n[ 296, 132, 55]\n. \n\n \n\nix. It is important to mention that the authors assume that the DGM can be used over the full range of \nKnudsen numbers (  ): from values much larger than 1 (when molecule-wall collisions should \ndominate), to values much less than 1 (when molecule-molecule collisions should dominate). \n\n \n\nx. Differently from their previous work, here the authors propose a direct representation of  ?  as given by \nEq. (4.45i), so to facilitate (or make more convenient) the solution of the system of equations, Eq. \n(4.45e), which must be solved simultaneously for each of the   components of [ ]. In this \nrepresentation, the DGM diffusion coefficients (i.e., the second-order tensor     ) are represented as a \nmatrix inverse [ ? ], a format often applied in the literature for Maxwell-Stefan models\n\n[ 64, 185, 297]\n. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 157 \n \n\nOn what concerns concentration losses, specifically, in their subsequent works\n[ 31, 298, \n\n299, 300]\n Janardhanan, Deutschmann, and coworkers adopt the same modeling framework as \n\ndescribed in the foregoing, though with some noteworthy differences. Some of them, which will \n\nbe presented in the next pages, deserve attention in that they can help to understand a \n\nnumber of artifacts introduced by mathematical models in counterpoint to experimental \n\nobservation. The authors applied\n[ 31]\n\n their \u201cgeneric\u201d computational framework to study the \n\nspecific case of an anode-supported button cell running on humidified     (3%     and air as \n\nthe oxidant), under direct internal reforming conditions. Essentially, what differentiates this \n\nwork from the previous ones is the use of standard finite-volume CFD techniques\n8\n for solving \n\nmass transfer and flow-field (two-dimensional) equations in the fuel channel and porous \n\nelectrode. Table 4.7 summarizes the modeling equations that are different in comparison to \n\nthose of their previous work (see Table 4.6). \n\nTable 4.7: Macro-homogeneous model from Janardhanan and Deutschmann [ 31]. \n\n  \nGoverning Equations \n\n \n  (   ??) =  ? ,  (unspecified) (4.46a) \n\n \n\n  (   ??  ??) = ?  ?\n2\n\n3\n  (     ??)

The designation \u201cunspecified\u2019 points out the fact that in this paper there was no explicit indication that a \ngiven equation is to be employed in a specific domain (e.g., fuel channel and/or electrode). This \ninformation is implied solely by the form of the equation, from which ambiguity or model uncertainty \n\nmight arise. For instance, the total velocity ( ??) vector has different meanings when in the context of pure \nfluid or porous electrode:  in the latter case, it must represent a macroscopic superficial velocity and not \nthe \u201ctrue velocity\u201d of gas flow within the voids of the porous medium. Otherwise, the porosity ( ) should \nhave been used to make the necessary differentiation. \n\n \n \n\n                                                      \n8\n They have implemented their framework (Table 4.6) in the CFD code ANSYS Fluent\n\n?.\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 158 \n \n\nCONTINUATION OF TABLE 4.7 \n\n \nii. Equation (4.46a) represents the continuity of the total mass of the system, in a given bounded domain. In \n\nprinciple, the source term  ? ,  in this equation should be always zero (everywhere) to ensure mass \n\nconservation.  However, by inspecting Eq. (4.46f) one verifies that it can be nonzero at the TPBs, wherein \n\nelectrochemical reactions are taking place. In this case, therefore,  ? ,  really represents what is \n\nsometimes called a \u201cspurious source term\u201d, which can arise as a result of the incomplete (no-rigorous) \ndescription of the boundary value problem. Heterogeneous chemical reactions, on the physical scale of \ndescription of Eq. (4.46f), are (usually) taken into account through boundary conditions prescribed at the \nsurfaces (\u201cwalls\u201d) of the domain.  However, if, for example, the problem\u2019s dimensionality excludes any \ndescription of phenomena along the spatial coordinate parallel to wall direction, then these phenomena \nmay be evaluated through ad hoc \u201ccorrections\u201d, i.e., source terms in the case of Eq. (4.46f). Thus, \n\nheterogeneous reactions are represented as \u201cpseudo-homogeneous reactions\u201d because  ? ,  is \nincorporated in the homogenous (continuum) description of the domain. Nonetheless, in the particular \ncase of Janardhanan and Deutschmann model in [ 31], these authors considered a two-dimensional \ndescription of the problem (that includes the spatial coordinate parallel to wall direction), yet, oddly \nenough, they have kept the spurious source term. \n \n\niii. Equation (4.46b) represents momentum balances (linear momentum \u201cconservation\u201d for a dissipative \nsystem). When also taking into consideration Eq. (4.46e) for electrode domains, it resembles the \n\u201cBrinkman equation\u201d\n\n[ 54, 47]\n. A few remarks about this equation\n\n9\n are given here with the hope that they \n\nmight serve for a better understanding of this modeling approach adopted by the authors.  \na. First, it is noted that the same remark made in \u201ci\u201d is still pertinent, that is, the absence of the \n\nporosity factor to clearly indicate that this equation refers to a porous domain. \n \n\nb. The inclusion of the term  ?  entails the same assumptions of Darcy\u2019s Law. In fact, Eq. (4.46b) \nsimplifies to Darcy\u2019s Law in the absence of meaningful stresses and for flows with sufficiently \nlow Reynolds number. Appearance of field quantities (stresses) in a macroscale equation \nwhich describes the flow in porous media is an interesting (and important) discussion. \nHowever, it should be already mentioned that the consideration of such field quantities, as in \nEq. (4.46b), is of doubtful physical significance. \n\n \n\nc. Considering the continuity equation as given by Eq. (4.46a), the momentum Eq. (4.46b) is not \nstrictly correct, because the \u201cnet mass source term\u201d should have been added to it. \n\n \n\nd. The \u201ccoefficient of dynamic viscosity\u201d (  ) that multiplies the stresses in Eq. (4.46b) is not the \nsame as the one that appears in Eq. (4.46e), for which the authors made no distinction. These \ncoefficients are different for reasons related to both the scale dependence of gas viscosity in \nporous media and to rarefication effects\n\n[ 301, 302, 303, 199]\n.  \n\n \n\niv. Equation (4.46c) is erroneous in the way it expresses material fluxes. If the pressure gradient is \n\nconsidered, DGM constitutive equations can only be written in terms of total fluxes ( ??? ) and thus never \n\nin terms diffusive fluxes ( ? ). Therefore, it turns out that in Eq. (4.46c) there is the double counting of \n\nfluxes\n[ 211]\n\n. That is,  ??? =      ??   ?  and so   (     ??)     ??? =   (2      ??   ? ). The authors have \n\nmade the misleading assumption that  ???  can be taken as the diffusive flux in Eq. (4.46c) and Eq. (4.45i). \n\n \nIn another study, the author\u2019s computational framework was again used to numerically \n\ninvestigate a planar SOFC under direct internal reforming conditions\n[ 298]\n\n, but at this time the \n\nauthors have analyzed the influences of certain operating parameters on optimal cell operation \n\nand aspects related to heat transfer, such as: (i) the influence of the steam-to-carbon ratio of \n\n                                                      \n9\n For the fluid domain, on the other hand, this equation does not deserves special attention in this regard, as it is \n\nreally the standard, steady-state \u201ccompressible\u201d Navier-Stokes equation for the mean flow, written in the high \nFroude limit. There is, however, an \u201cincorrect notation\u201d concerning part of the non-deviatoric (\u201cmean\u201d) stress \ntensor in this equation: the second term on the RHS of Eq. (4.46b) should have been written as ? 2 3?    \n[         ], where   is the second rank unit tensor.  Or, alternatively, as ? 2 3?           . \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

Now one sees that an additional momentum balance, Eq.

A short \ndiscussion on the origin and validity of this equation will be made in APPENDIX A. In [ 298] there is a \ntypographic error in this equation, in which the parameter    is missing. \n\n \n\nii. The authors abandoned Eq. (4.46c) in detriment of Eq. (4.47b) to describe the species mass conservation, \nthus previous errors are no longer present (see remark \u201civ\u201d in Table 4.7).   \n \n\niii. The additional time-dependent term in Eq. (4.47a), Eq. (4.47b), and (4.47c) is added for numerical \npurposes only (under-relaxation during the convergence steps), that is, at each axial position the \ntransient system of equations is solved until a steady-state (converged) solution is obtained (see \nAPPENDIX A). The use of this transient form of the equations now requires computing the total density \n(  ) of the gas-phase within the porous structure. Thus, Eq.

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 161 \n \n\nYong, Haberman, and Todd applied new approaches for modeling fluid flow and mass \n\ntransfer in SOFCs\n[ 307, 292, 308]\n\n, which included the development of a new theoretical model for \n\ngas-phase transport in porous electrodes, denominated as Cylindrical Pore Interpolation Model \n\n(CPIM). These authors have focused on the simulation of chemically reacting gas flows in the \n\nporous support structure of an integrated-planar SOFC (IP-SOFC), which is based on a cell \n\ndesign pioneered by Rolls-Royce (see Table 4.10 for an illustrative scheme of this design). \n\nThis porous structure (a reactive anode support, in terms of its main functionality) is \n\nimpregnated with the required catalysts for the steam reforming of methane. \n\nYong and Haberman have studied two simulation cases: one in which a pre-reformer \n\nmodule is employed\n[ 308]\n\n and another in which it is not\n[ 307]\n\n; however, in both cases, the \n\nelectrochemical cell (i.e., the SOFC) was not actually modeled, that is, electrochemical \n\nreactions were accounted for by prescribing fixed mass fluxes at the anode-electrolyte \n\ninterface, which in their turn were calculated for a fixed, uniform electric current density. The \n\nreason for such oversimplification is, apparently, because the main interest in these studies \n\nwas on the peculiarities of     reforming and WGS reactions. In the two case studies the \n\nauthors employed two different mathematical models to simulate the mass transfer within the \n\nporous support structure (see tables 4.10 and 4.11).

Haberman and Yong developed an in-house CFD code for solving the (two-dimensional) set of governing \nequations. The authors stated to have used a finite-volume, time-marching method for structured grids. \nThus, the l form of governing Eq. (4.49b) and (4.49d), as actually implemented in their numerical code, \nought to have included a transient term to account for the numerical relaxation (time march). \n\n \n\nii. The model for the macroscopic flow within the porous structure was again the empirical Darcy equation, \nEq. (4.49a), which describes the balance between the force from the pressure gradient    and the \nfrictional resistance from the solid material. Here, however, Haberman and Yong decided to express this \n\nequation using the pore velocity vector  ?? , instead of the superficial velocity (volume flow rate per unit \n\narea through the porous structure) as has been done by the previous authors cited herein. This \n\nsuperficial velocity ( ?? ) can be obtained by multiplying  ?? , the mean velocity within a pore (cross-\n\nsection), by  . \n \n\niii. In this approach, Haberman and Yong decoupled \u201ddiffusive fluxes\u201d from \u201cconvective fluxes\u201d, similarly to \nwhat have been presented in tables 4.3, 4.4, and 4.9. According to Eq. (4.49e), the flux vector of the  -th \n\nspecies,    ?? , , is defined as the sum of \"convection and diffusion fluxes\u201d, where the mass-averaged \n\npore velocity   ??  is the velocity calculated from the Darcy Eq. (4.49a). \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 163 \n \n\nCONTINUATION OF TABLE 4.10 \n\n \niv. The authors included a definition for the Reynolds number, Eq. (4.49c), so to discuss the range of validity \n\nof Eq. (4.49a). They stated that this latter equation is valid for     1. In their paper, the maximum \n\nvalue of    was about 0.0001 and hence the use of Eq. (4.49a) would be well justified. Nevertheless, the \n\nDarcy equation can only describe the flow in the porous structure well away from the walls, i.e., It cannot \nmodel a no-slip condition at a wall nor the resulting \u201cboundary layers\u201d\n\n10\n. Haberman and Yong provided \n\nan approximate theoretical analysis is in order to estimate the likely magnitudes of these \u201cboundary \nlayers\u201d. They have modified Eq. (4.49a) to allow calculation of the velocity boundary layers at the edges \nof the porous structure by adding the so-called \u201cBrinkman\u201d term to the Darcy equation, according to Eq. \n(4.49b). The normal stresses in this term were, however, ignored (see also note \u201ciii-b\u201d in Table 4.7). \n \n\nv. Diffusion mass fluxes  ?  were derived from Maxwell\u2013Stefan relations\n[ 216, 65]\n\n, Eq. (4.49f), which were \nwritten in matrix form, Eq. (4.49g), for the first  ? 1 fluxes. Thus [  ] and [ ] are matrices of size \n  ? 1    3 (in a three-dimensional problem). The matrix [   ] is a square matrix of order   ? 1 . The \n\nfirst  ? 1 diffusion fluxes are determined by inverting the matrix [   ]. The  -th flux  ?  is then found \nfrom the condition that the diffusive fluxes must sum to zero, Eq. (4.49j). \n\n \n\nvi. Their definition of diffusive flux, Eq. (4.49f), has problems related to the adopted frame of reference (see \nalso note \u201cv\u201d in Table 4.9). The way it has been expressed (i.e., using mole fraction gradients) is not \ncoherent with the adoption of a mass-averaged velocity referential (see note \u201ci\u201d in Table 4.14). \n\n \n\nvii. In this work, the authors did not consider Knudsen \u201cdiffusion\u201d in their mass transfer model. \n \n\nviii. Figure 4.6 shows the simulation results for the gas velocity vector   ??  in the  \u2013  plane. The variation of \n\nthe  -direction velocity     is shown in Fig. 4.5a and the  -direction velocity     is shown in Fig. 4.5b. \n\nFrom these figures one verifies that a net mass flux enters the porous structure at the anode interface \n( = 1 mm) and travels downward through the domain, \u201cspreading\u201d by a small amount in the  -\ndirection. Within the boundary layer adjacent to the fuel channel ( = 0),      is of a similar magnitude \n\nas the variations at  = 1 mm.  \n \n\nix. Figure 4.5c shows the simulation results for the pressure distribution within the domain. The authors \nstated that the overall pressure gradient in the  -direction is brought about by the prescribed pressure \ndrop in the fuel channel (note that neither modeling equations nor physical information were given for \nthe simulation of the fuel channel in this paper, besides the short discussion made at the Appendix \nsection therein). They also pointed out that in order to conserve mass, the pressure increases in the \nregions adjacent to each anode, where mass enters the system. This pressure rise results in a pressure \ngradient in the  -direction which causes the spreading of the flow in the  -direction at the anode edges. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTable 4.11: Macro-homogeneous model from Haberman and Yong [ 308]. \n\n  \nGoverning Equations Coupled to Constitutive Equations  (i.e., Transport Equations) \n\n     \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n= ?\n\n1\n\n  \n?   \n\n?  ?\n  ? \n\n \n\n   \n\n  , where \n1\n\n  \n=\n\n1\n\n  \n \n\n1\n\n  \n in porous structure (4.50a) \n\n \n\n  =\n32   \n\n ? \n    \n\n  \n1\n\n?       \n?  ?\n\n in porous structure (4.50b) \n\n \n\n  =\n3\n\n ? \n (\n ? \n\n8\n)\n  ?\n\n in porous structure (4.50c) \n\n \n\n                                                      \n10\n\n Darcy equation cannot handle correctly situations in which Stefan velocities at wall are (substantially) different \nfrom those existing in the \u201cbulk\u201d of the homogenized porous medium.

This equation, \nidentified by the authors as \u201cStefan-Maxwell transport equation\u201d, has indeed several critical problems: \n\na. Seemingly, the first term on the LHS (within the brackets) is probably what made the authors \nrelate it to the Maxwell-Stefan theory; however, such nomenclature is incorrect.  Solely by the \nway in which this term has been written one cannot really assert this relation.  It may rather \nbe identified with the so-called \u201cgeneralized diffusion driving force\u201d, as it became known from \nthe TIP theory\n\n[ 159, 80, 161]\n, which in the case of Eq.  (4.51a) also includes the thermophoretic \n\n\u201cforce\u201d (Souret effect). Moreover, the term   , \n    in this equation is in complete disagreement \n\nwith that of the standard Maxwell-Stefan model\n[ 185]\n\n. \n \n\nb. The applied definition of diffusive flux has issues related to the frame of reference, e.g., this \ndefinition is not frame indifferent/invariant. \n\n \n\nc. The definition of diffusive flux, when taking into account Eq. (4.51e), has problems to enforce \nmass conservativity because it applies a non-conservative form of fluxes (see note \u201ci-a\u201d). \n\n \n\nd. The second term on the LHS is inconsistent with the description of Eq. (4.51b) because in the \nformer it is implicitly assumed that the field of mean-flow velocity is constant. \n\n \n\ne. The dimension consistency of the first term on the RHS is questionable, based on the \n\nexpression given by Eq. (4.51d), i.e., apparently  ? ,   has the dimension of m    \n? cm?  \n\nwhereas Eq. (4.51a) has the dimension of     ? m? . \n \n\nf. The authors have informed that this equation is applied in both gas channels and porous \ndomains, which is obviously a misleading statement, e.g., Eq. (4.51e) is only valid for porous \nmedia. \n\n \n\nii. These authors referred to Eq. (4.51b) as the \u201cweakly compressible Brinkman equation\u201d. Not really sure \nwhy they gave such identification, as the authors have stated that this equation is to be applied in the gas \nchannel (homogeneous fluid domain).  \n\na. The last (source?) term on the RHS (\u201c \u201d) was left unidentified/unspecified in their paper, and \nso it was the parameter    . \n \n\nb. The physical significance of the term  2 3?     ?     is obscure (note the use of a negative \nsign). Perhaps it alludes to the coefficient of bulk viscosity\n\n11\n.

Equation (4.51d) is the transport equation for surface species (for those participating in electrochemical \n\nreactions at the TPB). Distinctively from the previous works presented in this chapter, surface diffusion \nphenomenon was considered by Xie and Xue (the hypothesis of local equilibrium with \nadsorption/desorption processes is implied).

The momentum equation, Eq. (4.52b), for the gas channel was also changed. Now it is recognized as the \nsteady-state \u201ccompressible\u201d Navier-Stokes equation for the mean flow.

The mass transport Eq. (4.53b) is equivalent to Eq. (4.52a), with the difference being that the former is \nexpressed in terms of mass fractions and the latter in terms of mole fractions.

(4.53e), differently from all other works presented so far, an \n\n\u201ctotal\u201d mass source term ( ? , ) appears, which is a direct result from the form of the continuity Eq. \n\n(4.53f).

In the \nliterature (mainly in the CFD area), the convective flux of single fluids is usually defined as being equivalent to \nadvection. Here, however, the former will be defined as the total flux of a conserved property (\u201cdiffusion plus \nadvection\u201d) in superimposed fluids. Surely, such convention is not without is controversies and it is far from being \nconsidered as a generally agreed convention. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

The effect of the variability of modeling parameters on simulation results. \n \n\n \n\nEvidently, given that the topics listed above constitute, by themselves, a special \n\nthematic, the respective literature will not be scrutinized in in this dissertation.  \n\n \n\n \n\nSo far, it has not been the intent of this chapter to go into the specifics of each model \n\n(and this remains true for the rest of this section). Nevertheless, a number of remarks may be \n\ndrawn at this point based on those considerations provided at the end of \u00a7\u00a74.5.1. Most of the \n\nnumerical simulations of SOFC in the literature, which apply the macro-homogeneous \n\napproach, do not perform any pre-assessment regarding the validity, physical pertinence, and \n\npotential limitations of their mathematical models. It appears that an \u201cintellectual inertia\u201d exist \n\nto a great extent. Not in the sense that the existing modeling approaches really represent a de \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 171 \n \n\nfacto state of art (for which neither improvement nor corrections would be necessary), but \n\nrather, unfortunately, some thoughtless \u201cestablishment\u201d. The same set of modeling equations \n\n(some of them with fragrant errors, as indicated in the foregoing pages) have been reused in \n\ndifferent works (at times by the same authors) to simulate both the \u201csimplest\u201d case and the \n\nmore complex multiphysics case, without any modification whatsoever; and there always \n\nseems to be fair agreement with empirical observation. The ubiquitous argument to persist with \n\nthese approaches is therefore their seeming validation against experimental results. In some \n\ncases, however, their apparent success is certainly illusory. Thus illusory conclusions may be \n\ndrawn from these \u201cvalidated\u201d results, engendering confusion and controversial perceptions.  \n\nConsidering the models reviewed in \u00a7\u00a74.5.2, one verifies that they try to represent the \n\n\u201caverage features\u201d of the random and complicated microscopic geometry of the porous \n\nelectrode using mainly two concentrated parameters, namely porosity ( ) and tortuosity ( ). \n\nThese parameters are, more often than not, empirically adjusted values to fit experimental \n\ndata. That is, they are really employed as \u201cfudge factors\u201d. In this situation, however, one \n\ncannot objectively assess if the combination of these two factors does, in fact, represent a \n\nreasonably accurate average of the \u201cmicroscopic features\u201d on the macroscale. It can also be \n\nseen that, in the case of modeling equations that were presented, explicit factors accounting \n\nfor correction of specific interfacial areas are seldom available, especially at phase boundaries  \n\nor to differentiate the usage of transport equations in distinct physical domains (e.g., active \n\nlayer and support substrate). Usually these factors, when available, are restricted to the \n\ndescription of electrochemical reactions \u201cinside\u201d rate expressions (i.e., in source terms only). \n\nThus, the correction of species fluxes and superficial current densities do not occur in a \n\ntransparent manner. In this case, the \u201carea conversion\u201d of a flux leaving one geometric domain \n\nto other neighboring domain is therefore not handled properly. \n\nNone of the works reviewed so far has provided any comments on the ratio of the \n\ncharacteristic length of the microstructure to the length characteristic of the macrostructure \n\nsize of porous layer. This kind of evaluation is especially critical for thin film SOFC designs \n\n(e.g., ?-SOFCs). Furthermore, all the models in \u00a7\u00a74.5.2, with the exception of CPIM (Table \n\n4.11), seems to apply an unmindful definition of mass fluxes, which (apparently) are tacitly \n\nassumed to be valid averages over the pore geometrical cross-section. In other words, these \n\nmacro-homogeneous models, besides ignoring any analysis of possible significant effects due \n\nto the variation of gas properties across the pore diameter, they are also unclear when defining \n\nif the flux is based on an apparent, averaged superficial velocity or calculated based on the \n\nactual velocity within the open pore volume. The importance of such coherence is not only \n\nsemantic, but it can also impact, for instance, the definition of porous media constitutive \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 172 \n \n\nequations and parameters. One can say at least that there is certain sloppiness in the notation \n\nused by these models. Finally, about the last consideration in \u00a7\u00a74.5.1, the issue it is not the \n\nfact the characteristic time for gas diffusion is not compared to that for electrically charging the \n\ndouble-layer capacity (which is usually of minor practical significance within the context of fluid \n\nflow and mass transfer in the gas-phase), but instead the absence of discussion about the \n\nmany other (possible) timescales of competing physicochemical processes or relaxation \n\nphenomena, which might adversely hinder the validity of a chosen mathematical model (see \n\n\u00a7\u00a73.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCertainly, single-scales models are not limited to describe the macroscale. They can be \n\nimplemented on a great range of spatial\u2013temporal scales, encompassing many braches of \n\nphysical-chemistry and molecular physics. In theory, single-scale models can be developed on \n\nthe smallest physical scale one can possibly think of, but their validity are subjected to the \n\nlimitations of a local minimum scale on which the usage of the respective \u201cgoverning\u201d \n\nequations is still valid. A prominent example of such wide-ranging spectrum of implementations \n\nis the molecular reaction dynamics\n[ 332]\n\n, which aims to provide a description of reaction \n\nchemistry on the fundamental scale of individual atoms and molecules. \n\nOn what concerns solid-oxide fuel cells, specifically, existing modeling methodologies \n\nrange from the atomistic to the system scale\n[ 1, 2]\n\n by virtue of the fact that SOFCs are intrinsic \n\nmultiscale systems. The reason is the necessity of focusing on an individual scale in order to \n\nmake possible the study of complete systems (see \u00a7\u00a71.4). Sub-macroscale modeling \n\nmethodologies constitute a broad category of examples in the SOFC literature. In this \n\ndissertation, however, one is only interested in those works that have meaningful nexus to \n\nconcentration polarization (i.e., transport phenomena within the gas-phase). This severely \n\nrestricts the number of published works under examination, as the vast majority of them devote \n\ntheir analysis either to the understanding of surface reactions taking place at the phase \n\nboundaries of electrodes/electrolytes, or to solid-phase transport phenomena (e.g., membrane-\n\npolarization processes related to charge transport).  Among the works that have pertinence to \n\nmass transport limitations and concentration-induced voltage losses, a significant part is \n\ndedicated to the mesoscale microstructural analysis and characterization of porous electrodes.  \n\nThe pertinence is justified by the fact that these works are able to provide relevant information \n\non the microstructure of porous medium with high (sub-micrometer) spatial resolution, which \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 173 \n \n\ncan be \u201chomogenized\u201d (e.g., through correlations or \u201cembedded\u201d microscale simulations) and \n\nsubsequently used by macroscale-continuum (macro-homogeneous) modeling approaches; or, \n\nalternatively, they can be directly represented in the model through the so-called structure-\n\nresolved approaches. The latter case is what will be effectively discussed in this section. The \n\nformer case will be addressed in \u00a7\u00a74.7 and \u00a7\u00a74.8. \n\n \n\n \n\nStructure-resolved models may be \u201cpartially resolved\u201d or \u201cfully resolved\u201d. Fully resolved \n\nmodels use information obtained from tridimensional\n13\n\n (3D) reconstruction of real (or virtual) \n\nsamples of electrodes (or porous supports), which enable one to directly probe the effects of \n\nelectrode geometry on transport phenomena. Partially resolved models apply some family of \n\ntheoretical methods based on idealized material models (e.g., percolation theory), which use a \n\nnumber of empirical physical characteristics as input. Partially resolved models are usually \n\ndeveloped in the form of algebraic correlation formulas, making their application comparatively \n\nsimpler. For this reason, there are works in literature that have applied fully resolved \n\nsimulations to derive partially resolved models\n[ 333, 334]\n\n. \n\nThe 3D reconstruction of real samples (see Table 4.18 for references) apply \n\nreconstruction techniques based on high-resolution imaging technologies, such as focused ion \n\nbeam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) or X-ray computed tomography (XCT). The 3D \n\nmicrostructure of electrode is virtually reconstructed in a computational field: in the FIB-SEM \n\n(destructive) technique, this reconstruction is done using a series of acquired 2D SEM images \n\n(each sequential image is obtained by gradually milling down through the electrode thickness); \n\nwhereas in the XCT (nondestructive) technique the retrieved information is \u201cnaturally\u201d in the \n\nform of 3D objects (\u201cvirtual slices\u201d that represent cross-sections of electrode and that can be \n\nused directly to create a 3D virtual model). Virtualized microstructures are then quantified by \n\nmeans of mathematical analyses, which can estimate the properties of interest, such as TPB \n\ndensity, tortuosity, porosity, and volume fractions of existing phases. \n\n  \n\n                                                      \n13\n\n Two-dimensional selected regions (\u201cthin cross-sections\u201d) of electrodes have also been used as input \ninformation in numerical (2D) simulations; or to reconstruct the 3D geometry of an electrode ( e.g., as in stochastic \nreconstruction). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 175 \n \n\nIn order to compute effective material properties (e.g., gas effective diffusion within the \n\nporous matrix) the reconstructed 3D data can be used in numerical simulations as phase \n\nboundary information. For instance, Lattice-Boltzmann Methods (LBM) have been applied for \n\nthis task (see Table 4.18 for references). There are also micro-modeling methods that use \n\nmaterial models with minimal or no experimental data as input\n[ 334, 17, 338]\n\n. The advantage of the \n\nlatter methods is that effective transport properties can be evaluated without resorting to \n\nempirical correlations or parameters fitted to experimental data. For example, these properties \n\ncan be estimated using Monte Carlo random walk methods running on virtual electrodes, \n\nwhich were numerically constructed through sphere packing algorithms\n[ 358]\n\n. \n\nAn expressive part of the works in Table 4.18 seeks only the obtainment of \n\nmicrostructure information of SOFC layers on the mesoscale level. This information is then \n\nusually used in either of two ways. In the first, it can provide lumped or homogenized \n\nmicrostructure parameters (e.g., porosity, tortuosity, constriction, and percolation factors) for \n\nthe calculation of effective transport properties (e.g., effective diffusion coefficient), which then \n\ncan be used in macroscale-continuum models (such as in \u00a7\u00a74.5.2). In the second way, it \n\nprovides detailed geometrical information of the physical domain (pore-phase or fluid domain; \n\nsolid-phase or \u201cwalls\u201d) over which gas transport equations can be directly solved. In order to \n\nsolve these equations on the mesocale level, LBM is often applied, although other methods \n\nsuch as FVM and FEM have also been employed for this purpose (see \u00a7\u00a74.6.2.6). It is \n\nimportant to emphasize that the mere fact of solving transport equations on the \u201cgeometrical \n\nmesoscale\u201d does not mean that the problem's physics is evaluated in its entirety on the \n\nmesoscale level. This is because, besides the detailed geometric information, the form of \n\ngoverning and constitutive equations also dictates the description level of the problem. This \n\npoint will be briefly seen in \u00a7\u00a74.8. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, partially resolved models use theoretically idealized material \n\nmodels that rely, to some extent, on empirical input data. Certainly, the goal of these simpler \n\nmicro-geometry modeling methods is to use the minimum possible amount of experimental \n\ndata as input, akin to methods that \u201creconstruct\u201d 3D virtual samples of porous electrodes. The \n\noutput of these partially resolved models finds its best application in macro-homogeneous \n\nmodels, as the former is able to provide the necessary lumped microstructure parameters used \n\nby the latter (see \u00a7\u00a74.7). The more commonly used geometrical models have been developed \n\nto predict the influences of microstructural properties on certain \u201chigher level properties\u201d, which \n\ncan then be applied in macroscale-continuum models. For example, they can predict the \n\ninfluence of solid grain size, pore size, and porosity on the TPB length (    ) of composite \n\nelectrodes\n[ 359, 360)\n\n. Among partially resolved models there is the family of methods built upon \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 176 \n \n\nthe statistical-based percolation theory\n[ 361]\n\n, which include models\n[ 362, 363]\n\n that accounts for the \n\npresence of polydispersed powders and pore formers in composite electrodes, predicting \n\neffective properties such as the surface area and the mean hydraulic radius of pore phase. \n\nSome other percolation models\n[ 364, 365]\n\n, with considerable generality in their practical \n\napplication, can also predict ionic and electronic effective conductivities. Table 4.19 provides a \n\nlist of reference works that dealt with constitutive, partially resolved models of SOFC \n\nelectrodes. \n\n \n\nTable 4.19: References on partially resolved models (\u201cgeometrical models\u201d) of porous electrodes. \n\n \n \n \n\nReference \n\nSOFC \nElectrode \n\nElectrode Properties \n(IP: Input Parameter; OP: Output Property) \n\nA\nn\n\no\nd\n\ne\n \n\nC\na\n\nth\no\n\nd\ne\n\n \n\nS\no\n\nli\nd\n\n G\nra\n\nin\n S\n\niz\ne\n\n (\no\n\nf \ne\n\na\nch\n\n p\nh\n\na\nse\n\n) \n\nP\no\n\nre\n s\n\niz\ne\n\n \n\nP\no\n\nro\nsi\n\nty\n \n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n F\n\nra\nct\n\nio\nn\n\n (\no\n\nf \ne\n\na\nch\n\n p\nh\n\na\nse\n\n) \n\nC\no\n\no\nrd\n\nin\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n N\n\nu\nm\n\nb\ne\n\nr \n\nP\na\n\nrt\nic\n\nle\n C\n\no\nn\n\nta\nct\n\n A\nn\n\ng\nle\n\n \n\nF\nra\n\nct\nio\n\nn\na\n\nl \nO\n\nv\ne\n\nrl\na\n\np\n B\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n P\n\na\nrt\n\nic\nle\n\ns \n\nD\nis\n\nta\nn\n\nce\n B\n\ne\ntw\n\ne\ne\n\nn\n P\n\na\nrt\n\nic\nle\n\ns \n\nP\nh\n\na\nse\n\n C\no\n\nn\nta\n\nct\n A\n\nre\na\n\n \n\nS\np\n\ne\nci\n\nfi\nc \n\nS\nu\n\nrf\na\n\nce\n A\n\nre\na\n\n \n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n S\n\np\ne\n\nci\nfi\n\nc \nT\n\nP\nB\n\n L\ne\n\nn\ng\n\nth\n \n\nA\nre\n\na\n S\n\np\ne\n\nci\nfi\n\nc \nT\n\nP\nB\n\n L\ne\n\nn\ng\n\nth\n \n\nE\nff\n\ne\nct\n\niv\ne\n\n C\no\n\nn\nd\n\nu\nct\n\niv\nit\n\ny\n \n\nM\ne\n\na\nn\n\n P\no\n\nre\n H\n\ny\nd\n\nra\nu\n\nli\nc \n\nR\na\n\nd\niu\n\ns \n\nDeng and Petric [ 359] ? ?

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 177 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs highlighted in Chapter 1, the microstructure features of porous electrodes play a \n\nmajor influence on the performance of SOFCs and thus microstructural design constitutes a \n\nkey part in the research and technology development of materials. Assuming that the basic \n\nengineering of new materials can be successfully accomplished by evaluating the effects of \n\ncertain idealized microstructural parameters, modeling techniques that directly use these \n\nparameters (to predict cell performance) are therefore evidently relevant in streamlining the \n\ntechnology development process. General criteria to support the selection of different modeling \n\ntechniques were discussed in \u00a7\u00a71.4. Based on that discussion, structure or microstructure \n\nresolved models are computationally expensive techniques and hence their application is \n\nusually only feasible to small, representative volume elements (RVE) of the porous electrode \n\n(typically in the range of 1 x 10   m  to 5 x 10   m  for 3D samples\n14\n\n). In other words, \n\nnumerical simulation is limited to (comparatively) quite small samples of the electrode material \n\nunder study. On the other hand, macroscale-continuum models are far less computationally \n\nintensive and thus they allow easier larger-scale description of a complete single-cell body. \n\nHowever, in addition to the trade-offs related to time-consuming calculations, one must \n\nquestion how physical scale information can affect the accurate description of transport \n\nphenomena that is controlled by certain physical characteristic scales. For instance, to what \n\nextent the system of interest is, in fact, governed by macroscopic mass, momentum, and heat \n\ntransfer; and to what extent \u201csubgrid-scale\u201d phenomena need to be properly resolved and \n\nhence cannot be undervalued. That is, to what degree one needs to include small scale \n\ninformation as a subset of the contents of larger scale physical-chemical processes, in order to \n\nrepresent important small scale physical-chemical processes that occur on spatio-temporal \n\nscales that cannot, otherwise, be adequately resolved on a macroscopic computational mesh. \n\nStructure-resolved models of porous components aim to increase the confidence level in \n\nexplaining the macroscopic performance of SOFCs. These models, \u201cby revealing what takes \n\nplace in the underground\u201d, are geared to give better \u201ccontrol\u201d of material design parameters. \n\nRepresentative examples of such models, which directly incorporate microstructural \n\ninformation on the mesoscale, are presented in what follows (see full listing in Table 4.18). \n\nNevertheless, \u201cadvanced topics\u201d on porous media characterization (including measurement \n\ntechniques, calculation methods, and analysis of microstructural properties) will not be \n\nappreciated in this work.  \n\n                                                      \n14\n\nThe determination of RVE is a critical step in microstructure resolved simulations of porous layers, especially \nwhen the sample volume size can affect numerical results. See Joss et al.\n\n[ 345]\n and other references in Table 4.18. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 178 \n \n\nResearchers from The University of Tokyo developed a series of studies\n[ 335, 337, 91, 102, \n\n145]\n in which the FIB/SEM technique\n\n15\n was combined with LBM to evaluate the performance of \n\nelectrode microstructures. In these studies, it is noteworthy the development and discussion of \n\nnew numerical methods to quantify the microstructure properties of 3D reconstructed \n\ncomputational domains, such as TPB length, volume fractions, connectivities, and tortuosities \n\nof the involved phases (e.g., pore, ionic, and electronic phases). In one of their papers\n[ 337]\n\n, \n\nrandom walk calculations were also used for comparison with LBM in evaluating tortuosity \n\nfactors. The authors have not consistently applied the same mathematical models throughout \n\ntheir works and significant differences exist. Tables 4.20 and 4.21 include information for \n\ncomparing them. \n\nFor the sake of clarity, it should first be noted that the diffusion problem is actually \n\nsolved by means of LBM; the continuum transport equations shown in the following tables (and \n\nalso by the authors in their original papers) are mainly used as mathematical archetypes (i.e., \n\n\u201cidealized statements\u201d) for the phenomena they seek to represent. The reason for that is the \n\ngeneral form of LBM equations, which encapsulates the physics of the problem under \n\nconsideration and thus, in this case, \u201cthe conventional\u201d transport equations of continuum \n\nphysics convey (more clearly) the idea that \u201ca diffusion model\u201d is being addressed. \n\nNonetheless, these \u201carchetypes equations\u201d play a key function in defining how the diffusion \n\ncoefficient should be evaluated in the LBM model itself in order to calculate the necessary \n\n(single) relaxation time. \n\n \n\nTable 4.20: Structure resolved model from Suzue et al.

(4.56m)    represents the velocity distribution function of \u201cfictitious\u201d particles of gas, electron, \n\nor ion with velocity\n16\n\n    in the  -th (link) direction;   \n  \n\n is a Maxwellian local equilibrium distribution \n\n(local equilibrium value for the population of particles in the direction of the  -th link);    is the \nrelaxation time;    represents the stencil point vector (\u201clattice points\u201d) among voxels;    and    are \nthe discretized time and space (voxel edge) steps, respectively. For 3D LBM simulations, D3Q15 (  = \n1,2,\u2026,15) or D3Q19 (  = 1,2,\u2026,19) models have been commonly used \n\n[ 369]\n. In their work, however, \n\nSuzue et al.\n[ 335]\n\n applied the D3Q6 (  = 1,2,\u2026,6) model in the case of SOFCs, affirming that for simple \ndiffusion simulations this model can be used with a slight loss of accuracy. \n\n \n\nv. Point-wise accurate LBM transport equations (4.56m) for charge and species conservation, Eq. (4.56a)-\n(4.56c), are solved directly on the reconstructed porous layer (3D computational domain represented \nby cubic voxels). The second and third terms on the RHS of Eq. (4.56m) represent the rate of change in \n   due to binary molecular collisions and thus they approximate the collision operator of Boltzmann \nequation. \n\n \n\nvi. Oddly enough the authors used a constant relaxation time (  = 0.99), fixed for all simulations (see \nnote \u201cv\u201d in Table 4.21).  No further information is given on how this particular time was obtained. \n\nFurthermore,   \n  \n\n was also left unspecified (although it is said to be a \u201cMaxwellia distribution\u201d). These \n\nissues are of major importance because the collision operator is responsible for the evaluation of the \ndiffusion phenomenon. Thus no clear link has been made with diffusion coefficients from transport \nequations, e.g. Eq. (4.56d), and, as a result of this, the modeling of diffusive processes \u201cbecame a black \nbox\u201d. Thus, the notes \u201ci\u2019 and \u201cii\u201d provided above are therefore without objective purpose, as one \ncannot really understand how the information on diffusion was actually handled. \n\n \n\nvii. The production term  ?   on the RHS of Eq. (4.56m) is calculated from the sources terms of Eq. (4.56a)-\n\n(4.56c), using a scheme akin to that of Mukherjee and Wang\n[ 370]\n\n. A schematic exemplifying the \nreaction calculation procedure is shown in the figure above.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                      \n16\n\n    in Eq. (4.56m) may also be interpreted as a discrete direction or plainly as a numerical quadrature point \n\n(representing a direction link) in the LBM. The term    is more generally represented using the notation e \n , which \n\nis the velocity of the  -th chemical species along the  -th discrete direction. In Suzue et al.\n[ 335]\n\n LBM equations \n\nwere solved just for one species (  ) and the extra index is therefore unnecessary. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

Partial pressures in this equation should have been divided by \na reference pressure value. This is important not only for dimensional consistency, but also to discern \nbetween the pressure value actually adopted in simulations from that originally used as reference in \nthe derivation of Eq. (4.56l). \n\n \n\nix. As it appears, there is a critical error in Eq. (4.56h) when one inspects the definition given by Eq. \n(4.56k). As discussed in \u00a7\u00a72.3, the polarization \u201c \u201d in this case must be the activation polarization \n(    ) and not its augmented version. Therefore, in this work the authors have completely neglected \nNernstian voltage losses due to concentration polarizations. One might argue that in Eq. (4.56l) the \ninfluence of concentration would have been already accounted for. In this case, however, this latter \nequation was obtained from the work of de Boer\n\n[ 94]\n, which was, in fact, devised for use with activation \n\npolarization. Even though the form of the BVE Eq. (4.56h) is, in principle, meant to be applied with \n    , as this equation is an empirically-based formulation it is possible that one could use the \nexchange current density formula, Eq. (4.56l), to fit experimental results based on augmented \npolarization values. Nonetheless, besides being a conceptual incongruity, this procedure most \ncertainly would lead to significant errors, even within the interpolation range of experimental data. \n\n \n\nTable 4.21: Structure resolved model from Shikazono et al.

Similarly to the work of [ 286], described in Table 4.3, Eq. (4.57a) may be seen as a result from DGM \nand which is valid for the case of isobaric counter-diffusion (uniform total pressure). Said more \ncorrectly, this equation follows directly from the Modified Maxwell-Stefan Model and not from DGM, \nassuming the validity of Graham\u2019s \u201cLaw\u201d. In this model, the Bosanquet formulation is also implied. The \nKnudsen diffusion coefficient was evaluated as in the previous work (Table 4.20) and also assuming a \nconstant mean pore radius (0.75  m) in all simulated cases. \n \n\nii. Differently from their previous work, Shikazono et al.\n[ 91]\n\n solved transport equations for \nelectrochemical potentials of electron and oxide ion (Eq. (4.57c) and (4.57d), respectively). Details on \nhow electric potentials and polarizations values are recovered from electrochemical potentials can be \nfound in the above mentioned paper.  \n\n \n\niii. Note that in Eq. (4.57e)-(4.57g) the sign of source terms has changed. There are two reasons for that: \na. There was a change in the orientation of coordinate axes. In the previous work\n\n[ 335]\n, the \n\npositive direction of main reaction axis ( -axis) was oriented towards the electrolyte \ninterface. However, in this work the positive direction of reaction axis (in this case the  -axis) \nis now oriented towards the current collector layer, so in the opposite direction. The sign \nchange is necessary in order to maintain physical consistency of state variable gradients (i.e., \nthe flux should be directed down the gradient field). \n\n \n\nb. Previously, equations governing the charge conservation were written in terms of electric \npotentials, whereas in this work the authors have opted to use electrochemical potentials. In \nthis latter case, negative electric charges account for the change in sign (see Eq. (2.42)). \n\n \n\niv. The BE, Eq. (4.57e), now uses the activation polarization (    ) according to the definition of Eq. \n(4.57h), instead of the augmented overvoltage. The error in their previous work was therefore \ncorrected (see note \u201cix\u201d in Table 4.20). The subscript \u201c  \u201d used in Eq. (4.57h) stands for \u201creference \nelectrode\u201d, whose hypothetical surface is assumed to be in thermodynamic local equilibrium with the \ngaseous (gas bulk) phase. This definition of Eq. (4.57h) is formally equivalent to that of Eq. (2.29). \n \n\nv. In this work Shikazono et al.\n[ 91]\n\n defined the relaxation time (  ) explicitly, according to Eq. (4.57k). \nHere the authors indicated that the time step    was chosen so that the relaxation time becomes \n  = 0.99. However, as the \u201cDGM diffusion coefficient\u201d (see Eq. (4.57l)) is not constant within the gas-\nphase, the time step should be changed accordingly. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 183 \n \n\nCONTINUATION OF TABLE 4.21 \n\n   \nvi. The work of Kanno et al.\n\n[ 102]\n applied the same modeling equations of Shikazono et al.\n\n[ 91]\n, with some \n\ndistinctions. They are: \na. The authors have incorporated another model for evaluating the exchange current density  0: \n\nin addition to de Boer\u2019s model\n[ 94]\n\n, as per Eq. (4.57i), they have also considered an exponential \nequation fitted on experimental data from Bieberle et al.\n\n[ 371]\n for comparison purposes.  \n\n \n\nb. Although the relaxation time (  ) was calculated using the same equations, Eq. (4.57k) and \n(4.57l), there is a slight difference concerning the time step   . Kanno et al.\n\n[ 102]\n chose     so \n\nthat the relaxation time results   = 0.99 at the point where the diffusion coefficient   takes \nits maximum value. \n\n \n\nvii. Matsuzaki et al.\n[ 145]\n\n applied very similar models to those of Shikazono et al.\n[ 91]\n\n and Kanno et al.\n[ 102]\n\n. In \nthe case of Matsuzaki and coauthors the used equations have a number of obvious differences \nstemming from the fact that a different type of problem was considered in their work (i.e., the \nmodeling of a MIEC cathode instead of   -    composite anodes). A specific modification worth \nmentioning concerns the expression used to evaluate the relaxation time in the LBM:   = 0.5  \n   [3     ]? . Thus one sees that the factor \u201c3\u201d is now in the denominator when compared to Eq. \n(4.57k). It is not clear, however, whether this was a typographical error or not, as there was no written \nargument for such modification. \n\n \n\nResearchers from The University of Connecticut have developed LBM simulations\n[ 372, \n\n373, 338, 374]\n to study 2D and 3D mass diffusion of both reacting and inert species in the pore \n\nspace of   -    anodes. For 3D simulations, the authors used computational domains \n\nconstructed from both real (reconstructed via XCT) and virtual samples of porous elect rodes, \n\nthe latter based on 3D material models constructed via sphere packing algorithm. For 2D \n\nsimulations, geometry input data from a single micrograph (SEM) image was used in \n\nconjunction with periodic boundary conditions along one of the two main coordinates axes (in \n\norder to represent the total extents of the original electrode layer; see Figure 4.7 for \n\nclarifications). The main goal in these works\n[ 372, 338]\n\n has been to develop a multicomponent \n\nmass transport model to obtain the steady-state mole fraction distributions of reacting (  , \n\n   ) and inert (  ) gases throughout the porous anode (see Fig. 4.7). This information was \n\nused to evaluate the effect of medium geometry (mainly the porosity) and to calculate the \n\nanodic concentration polarization. A secondary goal was to determine structural (porosity-\n\ntortuosity) factors      of reconstructed 3D geometries, by solving the 3D Laplace equation for \n\na \u201cgeneric conserved quantity\u201d (see [ 338] for details). Calculated factors were then used in 1D \n\nmacro-homogeneous models employing effective diffusivity values (as in, for example, the \n\nmodel given in Table 4.4), to simulate the same multicomponent mass transport problem. \n\nFinally, respective results were compared to those from the structure-resolved (LBM) \n\nsimulation. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 184 \n \n\nIn terms of physical modeling considerations, the markedly differences of the works of \n\nJoshi and coworkers in comparison to that of tables 4.20 and 4.21 are: (i) Joshi and coworkers \n\nconsidered a true multicomponent mass transport (i.e., ternary gas system), whereas \n\nresearchers from the University of Tokyo solved the mass diffusion problem for only one gas \n\ncomponent (i.e.,   ); (ii) differently from the models in tables 4.20 and 4.21, Joshi and \n\ncoworkers treated the TPB region as an infinitely thin boundary (located at anode/electrolyte \n\ninterface) and thus without the precise spatial identification of TPB regions through the anode \n\nthickness; (iii) as a direct result of (ii), Joshi and coworkers have also not considered the \n\nsimultaneous modeling of electron transport (through the    phase) and ion transport (through \n\nthe     phase). Nonetheless, the multicomponent mass transport model developed by Joshi \n\net al.\n[ 373]\n\n has a higher physical fidelity and relies on less simplifying assumptions. Their LBM \n\nvariant is based on the two-fluid model initially proposed by Luo and Girimaji\n[ 375]\n\n and extended \n\nby McCracken and Abraham\n[ 376]\n\n in order to model gas components with different molecular \n\nweights. Even though Joshi and coworkers have discussed elsewhere (e.g., see [ 377]) about \n\nthe capability of LBM in describing non-continuum diffusion effects, this topic was not the focus \n\nof their SOFC simulations\n[ 372, 373, 338]\n\n, wherein they focused on continuum transport modeling \n\nonly. The actual mathematical model proposed by these authors will not be presented in this \n\nsection, as this would require an overly lengthy discussion of LBM, unfit for the purposes of \n\nthis chapter.  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7: porous SOFC anode model from Joshi et al.\n[ 373]\n\n used in 2D LBM simulations.

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 185 \n \n\nParadis and Sund\u00e9n\n[ 346]\n\n evaluated the application of LBM for modeling reaction-\n\ndiffusion processes in a porous SOFC anode on a mesoscopic level. These authors applied \n\nthe modeling framework of Joshi and coworkers\n[ 372, 373]\n\n, with the apparent difference being that \n\nParadis and Sund\u00e9n considered a binary gas mixture (   and    ). They also performed LBM \n\nsimulations in 2D porous domains: one of the porous domains was created through randomly \n\nplaced circular obstacles; and the other one was obtained by discretization of a single \n\nmicrograph image of a real anode sample. By studying different simulations scenarios, with \n\nand without including the production and consumption of chemical species (i.e., \n\nelectrochemical reactions), Paradis and Sund\u00e9n aimed at the evaluation of geometry effects as \n\na \u201cpotential risk\u201d for limiting transport processes (\u201ctransport blockage\u201d). Although there are not \n\nmuch supporting results or discussion in their paper, these authors were probably intereste d in \n\nhighlighting that currently used macro-homogeneous models might not be capable of \n\nevaluating microstructure effects of porous SOFC anodes. In other words, that with a few \n\nempirical macroscopic parameters (e.g., porosity and tortuosity) one cannot properly describe \n\nthe effective interaction between fluid particles and walls of the porous media, and thus to \n\ncapture the mesoscopic physical behavior. \n\n \n\nGuan et al.\n[ 351]\n\n applied the modeling framework of Joshi and coworkers to simulate gas \n\ntransport in   -    3D microstructures subjected to thermal cycling treatments. Thermal \n\ncycling treatments strongly influence the anode 3D structure, including interior connectivity, \n\nphase size, and TPB density. After each thermal cycle, the authors calculated the \n\nconcentration polarization based on the simulation results of mole fraction distributions of \n\nelectroactive species, through the connected pore phase. Even though Guan et al. have \n\nobtained a (experimental) 3D detailed distribution of TPB sites (from XCT reconstructed \n\nmicrostructures samples), they chose a simplified distribution model of TPBs, akin to the work \n\nof Joshi et al.\n[ 372]\n\n, where TPB regions were treated as zero-thickness boundary, located at the \n\nanode/electrolyte interface. It is worth noting an erroneous statement made in the paper of \n\nGuan et al.\n[ 351]\n\n: the authors stated that the LBM is improper for gas transport modeling when \n\nthe pore diameter is smaller than the mean free path of the gas molecules (e.g., when \n\n\u201cdiffusion\u201d is dominated by molecule\u2013wall interactions); and that, in this case, LBM should be \n\nreplaced by other methods. The literature is vast enough (though largely ignored by the SOFC \n\ncommunity) with respect to works that use LBM in nanoporous materials or in other flow \n\nsystems with rarified effects. Surely, the LBM version that was applied by Guan et al. is \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 186 \n \n\nunsuited for this task, but this does not mean LBM is definitely unable to model the \n\nintermediate regime, encompassing free molecular flows.  Certainly, strong non-equilibrium \n\nflows cannot be properly described by theories based on standard Bolztmann equation\n[ 174, 378]\n\n \n\nand , therefore, through hierarchically derived models such as the LBM. \n\n \n\nXu et al.\n[ 329, 379]\n\n performed LBM simulations on the mesosscale to emphasize the \n\ncapabilities of this modeling technique for the accurate prediction of multi-component mass \n\ntransfer in SOFC porous electrodes, especially when it is compared to traditional approaches \n\nsuch as macro-continuum models. Furthermore, despite the frequently assumption made in \n\nsome SOFC modeling approaches, which ignores the concentration polarization (i.e., assumes \n\nthat the gas transport in SOFC electrodes is a \u201cvery efficient process\u201d), these authors discuss \n\nthat multi-component mass transfer in porous electrodes can have profound effect on the \n\nsimulation of the cell electrochemical performance. More precisely, Xu and coauthors indicate \n\nthat concentration polarization can reach the same order of magnitude as the other two main \n\npolarizations (\u201cactivation\u201d and \u201cohmic\u201d) for the cases of low porosity, low reactant \n\nconcentrations, and high average current densities. Therefore, they conclude that to simply \n\nneglect the concentration loss is unreasonable based on the account that reactant \n\nconcentration and current density vary sharply along the flow channel of fuel cell\n[ 329]\n\n. \n\nMeanwhile, these authors also affirm that some classical macroscopic models (e.g., based on \n\nMFM, DGM, and MSM), which have been used to evaluate concentration polarization, might \n\nas well result in imprecise prediction of SOFC losses, given that they are not competent to \n\nstudy the gas transport accurately in porous electrodes on the micro or mesoscale. Or, at \n\nleast, Xu and coauthors have shown that LBM can be a much more accurate method for \n\nsimulating mass transfer within SOFC electrodes.  \n\nXu and coauthors used a representative elementary volume (REV) scale Lattice-\n\nBoltzmann (LB) model based on the Brinkman-like equation for flows in porous media.  \n\nCompared to other the pore scale models (including most of LBM models mentioned in the \n\nabove paragraphs), in which detailed geometric information is needed and the computation \n\ndomain cannot be too large due to limited computational resources, the REV scale LB model \n\ncan be used for systems of larger size and it is more competitive in parametric studies. Several \n\nLBM models in SOFC literature has either adopted single-fluid models (employing single \n\nrelaxation time approximation, which is restricted to unity Prandtl and Schmidt numbers\n[ 369]\n\n or \n\nhas taken the species concentration field as mere a passive scalar. Similarly to Joshi et al.\n[ 373]\n\n, \n\nXu and coauthors implemented\n[ 329]\n\n a two-fluid model, which treats mutual collisions and self-\n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 187 \n \n\ncollisions independently so that the viscosity and diffusion coefficients can be varied \n\nindependently by a proper choice of mutual- and self-collision relaxation-time scales. The \n\nauthors have applied the REV scale LB model in 2D simulations to investigate the transport of \n\nmulti-component reactant gases and to study electrochemical characteristics of a planar \n\nanode-supported SOFC\n[ 379]\n\n. As for the case of Joshi et al.\n[ 372, 373]\n\n, the actual mathematical \n\nmodel proposed by Xu and coauthors will not be presented in this section, as this would also \n\nrequire an overly lengthy discussion of LBM. \n\n \n\nFinally, there are works in the SOFC literature that solved continuum transport \n\nequations (the same as those presented in \u00a7\u00a74.5.2) on the pore-scale, using well-known \n\nmethods such as finite-difference method\n[ 341, 354]\n\n, finite-volume method\n[ 356]\n\n, finite-element \n\nmethod\n[ 344]\n\n, and volume of fluid method\n[ 333]\n\n. Essentially, the goal of these works has been to \n\npredict physical properties by solving discretized partial differential equations without source \n\nterms (e.g., Laplace equation). Since boundary conditions are identical for the equivalent \n\nmacro-homogeneous material and the real sample material, the pore scale solution (e.g., local \n\nconcentration distribution or its resulting mass flux evaluated at the boundaries of the domain) \n\nis then compared to prescribed macroscale mass fluxes in order to calculate effective transport \n\nproperties (e.g., effective diffusion coefficient).

These models \n\nare more commonly applied in parametric studies, when one is particularly interested in \n\nassessing, on a straightforward manner, the effects of certain micro-geometry parameters \n\n(e.g., electrode particle size) on macroscale variables (e.g., current density and cell voltage). \n\nThis type of modeling technique may be included within the so-called \u201chierarchical multiscale \n\napproaches\u201d, in which known information at one scale, typically passing through some sort of \n\naveraging process, is used to generate a model on a larger scale. A listing of reference works \n\nthat have applied the above mentioned technique is provided in Table 4.22 (some these \n\nreferences were already cited in other sections of this chapter). \n \n\n\nTable 4.22: Macroscale models of SOFC porous layers Informed by microscale correlations. \n\n Based on DGM Based on MFM or EPDM Based on MMS \n\n   Bertei et al.

That is, although they solve transport equations \n\non a characteristic mesocale length (\u201cgeometrical mesoscale\u201d), part of the physics that are \n\ncaptured by the modeling equations are not on the mesocale but on a coarser-scale. \n\nTherefore, the claims of some of those works of having performed \u201cfully mesoscale \n\nsimulations\u201d are not, rigorously, a true assertion. From the perspective that transport \n\n                                                      \n17\n\n Here the term \u201cmicroscale\u201d is used loosely, meaning everything that is \u201csmaller\u201d than the macroscale. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 189 \n \n\nphenomena have been solved in the pore-level description (mesoscale length) those works \n\nhave indeed simulated, at least partially, mesoscale phenomena. However, as most of the \n\ngoverning (and/or constitutive equations) have been expressed under the hypothesis of a \n\ncontinuum medium (e.g., for which the validity of the hydrodynamic limit is implied), they also \n\nincorporate some of the limits that constrain the macroscale-continuum description. \n\nFurthermore, the use of LBMs based on a single relaxation time is another example of such \n\nlimitation\n[ 386, 387, 388]\n\n. \n\nTherefore, at this point one may acknowledge that all representative works from the \n\nSOFC literature that applied \u201cmacroscale models Informed by microscale simulations\u201d have \n\nbeen considered in preceding sections. There is but one example that is worth (re)mentioning \n\nand that should be taken as representative of the class of simulations that indirectly, or non-\n\nconcurrently (see \u00a7\u00a74.9 for clarification on this term), use microscale information to simulate \n\nmacroscale processes. These models (\u201cmacroscale models informed by microscale \n\nsimulations based on 3D reconstructions\u201d) are conceived in a similar fashion to those \n\ndescribed in \u00a7\u00a74.7 (\u201chierarchical multiscale approach\u201d), but with the fundamental difference \n\nrelated to how microstructural parameters (\u201cthe passing information\u201d) are quantitatively \n\nevaluated. In this case, these parameters (whether purely morphological or not) are obtained \n\nthrough direct numerical simulation on the geometrically complex pore-scale, which was \n\ntopographically reconstructed from FIB-SEM or XCT measurements. The information gathered \n\nfrom the pore-scale simulation is then averaged to the appropriate macroscale characteristic \n\nlength, using some suitable homogenization method (as, for example, the one mentioned at \n\nthe end of \u00a7\u00a74.6.2). Once microstructural parameters have been quantified, they are used in \n\n1D (or, sometimes, in 2D) macroscale simulation of SOFC electrodes. \n\nA representative example of such modeling technique, which indirectly use microscale \n\ninformation to simulate macroscale processes, is that of Kishimoto et al.\n[ 342]\n\n who have \n\nquantified microstructural parameters (e.g., volume fractions, tortuosity factor, surface-to-\n\nvolume ratio, and TPB density) by means of random-walk-based diffusion simulations. The \n\nquantified parameters were then applied in the 1D macro-homogeneous numerical simulation \n\nof a   \u2013    cermet, using the DGM to evaluate the mass transport. Other examples from \n\nliterature that applied this modeling technique were already presented in this chapter\n[ 373, 328]\n\n. \n\nThese works all have implemented 1D macro-homogeneous models as a basis of comparison \n\nwith 3D mesoscopic models of electrode performance. However, in their assessment of one -\n\ndimensional models, the respective discussions were relatively narrow in scope. In the \n\naforementioned works, microstructural parameters have been obtained as fixed values, without \n\nthe possibility to link these values to the changes of microstructure features ( e.g., in contrast to \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 190 \n \n\nthe micro-modeling models of Table 4.19) unless a new full simulation on the pore-scale is \n\nperformed. This possibility would confer a significant flexibility to their usage and also enrich \n\nthe discussion on how these models compare to 3D mesoscopic models. By the time of this \n\nwriting, there is no published work in SOFC literature that derives expressions to upscale \n\nindividual pore performance to full-scale electrodes\n18\n\n. Furthermore, most published works \n\nhave only resorted to \u201cfull homogenization\u201d (i.e., a single parameter value is attributed to \n\nporous layer as a whole\n19\n\n) and none of them has applied more sophisticated (i.e., more \n\nrigorous) upscaling techniques, such as those based on the method of volume averaging\n[ 389, \n\n390, 48, 391]\n. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis section address some topics that are deemed important to clarify key concepts of \n\nmulsticale modeling, particularly within the context of the so-called \u201cmacroscale models \n\nInformed by microscale simulations\u201d. The present dissertation work is not, in fact, about \n\nmultiscale modeling techniques per se or bridging-scale methods\n[ 154, 155, 39]\n\n.  However, by \n\nbriefly examining some of the principles and methods of multiscale modeling, this monograph \n\ncan certainly emphasize the potential deficiencies of current SOFC mathematical models used \n\nto simulate mass transport processes. Several of these deficiencies are related to whether or \n\nnot perform microscale or mesoscale simulations according to local (microscopic and \n\nmesoscopic) quantities instead of using macroscale-continuum constitutive relations. That is, \n\nin what conditions one should calculate macroscopic properties of materials by theoretical \n\nmodeling and computational simulation from a more fundamental perspective. This \n\n\u201cinescapable\u201d necessity of modeling physicochemical processes on disparate scales, in order \n\nto accurately evaluate large-scale phenomena, has been suggestively referred to as \u201cthe \n\ntyranny of scales\u201d\n[ 392]\n\n because it is not an easy task to recognize the aforementioned \n\nconditions. Moreover, no single solution or approach has the potential of bridging all dissimilar \n\nscales\n[ 154, 155]\n\n in to a seamless description. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n18\n\n The work of Bertei et al.\n[ 334]\n\n would be the closest to this goal. As an example of what is meant by \u201cexpressions \nto upscale pore-scale performance,\u201d see Blasi et al.\n\n[ 420]\n who have modeled reaction\u2013diffusion processes within \n\ncatalyst washcoats. \n \n\n19\n Nishi et al.\n\n[ 328]\n seems to be an exception. These authors also applied a 1D model with local values for the \n\ntortuosity factor (i.e., the value of this parameter varied according to the distance from the electrolyte interface). \nThe model gave poor results when compared to the one that used averaged tortuosities ( i.e., a single parameter \nvalue). \n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 191 \n \n\nMultiscale modeling is a wide-ranging interdisciplinary field, where approaches are \n\noften material- and application-specific. The use of any multiscale approach has to be carefully \n\nweighed on a case-by-case basis\n[ 155]\n\n. According to Fish\n[ 154]\n\n, multiscale modeling should take \n\nadvantage of the fact that in many natural systems only a small fraction of the total region is of \n\ninterest. Determining which regions should be simulated with coarse-scale\n20\n\n or fine-scale \n\nmodels really improves the odds of minimizing the above mentioned deficiencies. Outside of \n\nthe region of interest one should only perform coarse-scale calculations, because no detailed \n\ninformation about this region is necessary. Whereas in the region of interest one should \n\nperform both fine-scale and coarse-scale calculations: the coarse-scale describes the \n\nhomogeneous part of physicochemical processes using just a few degrees of freedom; on the \n\nother hand, the solution of fine-scale equations enables the detailed modeling of \n\nphysicochemical processes and thus higher fidelity where it is necessary. Therefore, by \n\nconsidering simultaneously models on different scales, the aim is to select a multiscale \n\napproach that effectively shares the efficiency of macroscopic models as well as the accuracy \n\nof microscopic models\n[ 39]\n\n. Multiscale approaches may be subdivided in two categories\n[ 155]\n\n: \n\nI. Information-passing (or hierarchical) multiscale approach: in this approach, the \n\nfine-scale response is idealized (i.e., approximated or unresolved) and its overall \n\n(average) response is incorporated into the coarse-scale description. Information-\n\npassing methods are typically used to model the overall response of fine-scale \n\nphenomena, except at the so-called \u201chot spots\u201d, e.g. in the vicinity of boundary- \n\nlayers, where concurrent methods are more suitable. The quantities of interest are \n\nlimited to the coarse-scale, provided that they can be readily computable from \n\nfine-scale information. Special features of the fine-scale physics (e.g., scale \n\nseparation and self-similarity) should be taken advantage of. \n \n\nII. Concurrent multiscale approach: fine and coarse-scale resolutions are \n\nsimultaneously employed at different portions of the problem domain (in some \n\nmodeling contexts, this approach is also known as \u201chybrid method\u201d) and the \n\nexchange of information occurs through their interface. Thus, the concurrent \n\nmultiscale modeling performs simultaneous simulations at different spatio-\n\ntemporal scales within a single simulation process, in which there is dynamic \n\nsharing of information between concurrent simulations. Computational \n\nsubdomains, where different scale resolutions are employed, can be either \n\ndisjoint or overlapping. \n \n\nConcurrent approaches require that precise information on the material microstructure \n\nshould be known in subdomains where fine-scale models are to be considered. Moreover, the \n\ninterface (or interphase) between the fine and coarse scales should be properly described. \n\nThus, the utilization of concurrent methods is, in practice, hindered when there is a lack of \n\n                                                      \n20\n\n From the point of view of statistical mechanics, coarse-scales are those that can be observed directly in \nexperiments and only the averaged effects (ensemble averaging) of fine-scales quantities are important. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 192 \n \n\ndetailed knowledge about the microstructure at \u201chot spots\u201d. At these locations, concurrent \n\nmultiscale approaches require fine-scale resolution whereas information-passing approaches \n\nonly require the material microstructure to be reconstructed in small representative \u201cwindows\u201d \n\n(i.e., from a REV sample). Another formidable roadblock to concurrent approaches is the \n\nuncertainty and complexity introduced by the physics of finer-scales, which requires the (prior) \n\nidentification of what information need to be transferred from one model or scale to another \n\nand what physicochemical principles must be satisfied during the transfer of information\n[ 154]\n\n. \n\nThus, when coupling coarse and fine scales one has to account for the different fundamentals \n\nof each theory (e.g., whereas in the theory of molecular dynamics every individual molecule is \n\nconsidered, in the continuum mechanics an average is considered) and how to properly \n\ndescribe the transition (or the so-called \u201chandshaking\u201d) region that actually bridges both \n\ntheories. \n\nIn both information-passing and concurrent approaches, the overall response of the \n\nmaterial from its fine-scale constituents can be obtained using homogenization techniques\n[ 155, \n\n389, 391]\n.  Among the necessary conditions for homogenization of a multiscale system, one \n\nrequires that, at a certain finer scale, the governing equations, including the constitutive \n\nequations of physical phases, are well understood or, at least, better understood than at the \n\ncoarser-scale\n[ 154]\n\n. Under this assumption, homogenization establishes a mathematical \n\nframework by which coarse-scale equations can be derived from well-defined fine-scale \n\nequations, provided that spatial scales are separable at all relevant scales. However, the \n\nvariability of physicochemical parameters at multiple scales might affect the medium \n\nhomogenization and thus the simulation outcome. For instance, microcracks are often \n\nrandomly distributed and characterization of their interface properties is difficult. In this case, \n\nthe use of a multiscale approach may not be the best choice. Nevertheless, novel multiscale \n\ntechniques, such as the multi-resolution continuum approach\n[ 393]\n\n can cope with the above \n\ndifficulty by incorporating statistical factors into the mathematical model. The multi -resolution \n\ncontinuum approach is based on the concurrent nested homogenization of the randomness of \n\nmaterial structures. \n\nInformation-passing and concurrent multiscale approaches are two alternative (and \n\ncomplementary) modeling techniques that constitute what was referred to as \u201cmacroscale \n\nmodels Informed by microscale simulations\u201d. The SOFC literature that has been reviewed in \n\nthis dissertation has no examples in which the concurrent multiscale approach was effectively \n\napplied. Furthermore, a number of works that have allegedly performed fine-scale simulations \n\n(as in \u00a7\u00a74.6) are affected by possible inconsistencies between the length scale on which \n\nsimulations have been executed and the theoretical basis that limits the physical validity of the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 193 \n \n\nrespective modeling equations. These inconsistencies may be seen as a manifestation of the \n\nlimits for the spatial and temporal scales within which the \u201ctrue\u201d governing physics is valid. The \n\nphysics governing transport processes often changes with scale, so that the models \n\nthemselves must change in structure as the numerous ramifications of transport-related events \n\npass from one scale to another. Therefore, the correct description for the applicable scaling \n\nphysics can dominate simulation efforts wherever large disparities in spatio-temporal scales \n\nare encountered\n[ 392]\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs the main topic of this work is the discussion of gas transport within the porous layer \n\nof SOFCs, only succinct remarks are made in order to highlight a number of possible \n\nshortcomings of simplified mathematical models that are used in gas channels. Moreover, as \n\nintroduced in \u00a7\u00a71.4, only the button-cell flow arrangement is considered herein. Nevertheless, \n\nmuch of the discussion in this section is general enough to be valid for other types of channel \n\ngeometries. The importance of properly modeling gas channels has been already discussed in \n\nthis chapter: the main goal of this model is, within the overall simulation setup, to account for \n\nthe effect of fuel (or oxidant) depletion along the gas channel of a SOFC (see Fig. 3.8 and Fig. \n\n3.9), as progressively more fuel/oxidant is utilized in the chemical reactions. Ideally, this model \n\nshould capture all non-uniformities (gradients) in the concentration of gas species within the \n\nchannel\u2019s volume. Thus, not just the lengthwise depletion is important but also the \n\ndetermination of the actual gas concentration at the channel/porous layer interface; that is, in \n\nthe case where the gas concentration value in the \u201cbulk\u201d (far away from the wall) is significantly \n\ndifferent from that found deep within the flow boundary-layer. \n\nFrom the point of view of fluid dynamics, gas flows in button-cells (see Fig. 1.17 and \n\nFig. 1.18) can be considered to fall within the general family of impinging wall jet flows; or, \n\nmore precisely, radial wall jets\n[ 394, 395]\n\n formed by the normal impingement of a round (or slot) \n\njet, whose nozzle is separated from the wall by a finite distance (often called nozzle-plate \n\nspacing or just gap). The radial jet is assumed to spread over a plain, permeable wall with local \n\nsuction and/or injection (depending on the \u201cflux direction\u201d of the net reaction rate in the porous \n\ndomain). Although this type of flow has been extensively studied in the literature\n[ 396, 397, 398, 399, \n\n400, 401, 402, 403]\n, works in the SOFC literature paid little or no attention to these studies. \n\nTherefore, no comprehensive review will be reported in this monograph concerning this \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 194 \n \n\nthematic (\u201cimpinging wall jets\u201d). The presentation will be limited to what is typically consi dered \n\nin the SOFC literature. \n\nThere are three alternative formulations often used for simulating the steady-state flow \n\nin gas channels for conditions that are typical of button-type SOFCs, namely: (i) Navier-Stokes \n\nequations (or CFD approach); (ii) boundary-layer equations; and (iii) plug-flow equations. \n\nNevertheless, models based on the boundary-layer approximation have seldom been used \n\n(this author is unaware of any published work that actually applied such models to SOFCs). \n\nThe discussion of these models will be in the lines of Raja et al.\n[ 404]\n\n, who critically evaluated \n\nsimilar flow models for catalytic-combustion monoliths. The remarks on gas channel models \n\naim to draw attention to the range of validity of the various approximations in terms of physical \n\nand numerical accuracy (computational resources required to perform calculations is of less  \n\nimportance here). \n\nDepending on the flow conditions, certain approximations and simplifications may be \n\nappropriate in representing the mass transport. Comprehensive models are often based on \n\nsolving the complete Navier-Stokes equations (i.e., CFD numerical codes), considering mass \n\nand momentum transport along both radial and axial directions. Plug-flow models are relatively \n\nsimpler models that disregard diffusive terms, forming a differential-algebraic-equation (DAE) \n\ninitial-value problem for the axial variation of the \u201cmean\u201d species composition. An intermediate \n\nalternative is to use models based on the boundary-layer approximation, wherein axial \n\n(stream-wise) diffusive transport is neglected, but detailed transport to and from channel walls \n\nis retained (including diffusion). In this case, boundary-layer equations can be casted into a \n\nsystem of DAEs (for instance, using the method of lines).  \n\nBeyond assuming perfect-gas behavior and laminar regime, Navier-Stokes equations \n\n(the CFD approach) used in the SOFC literature have few assumptions. Their solution, when \n\nsolved in conjunction with mass-species transport equations (e.g., Fickian models), provides \n\naxisymmetric velocity, pressure, and species composition fields in the channel (see Fig. 4.8 as \n\nan example of CFD solution in a button-cell). There are several numerical studies that have \n\nused CFD models to calculate the flow in the gas channels of button-type SOFCs\n[ 31, 405, 304, 406, \n\n407, 408, 409]\n. Particularly, in Fig. 4.9 it is shown the CFD solution obtained by Goldin et al.\n\n[ 304]\n for \n\nthe    mole fraction along the button-cell symmetry axis (fuel chamber). In this case, one can \n\nverify that the concentration gradient, along the normal direction to the wall, was in fact \n\nnegligible at different testing conditions of current density and fuel flow rate.  However, as will \n\nbe seen below, this may not be always the case (e.g., mass-transfer limited reactions) \n\ndepending on channel geometry and cell operating conditions (e.g., reaction rates, flow rates, \n\nfuel/oxidant dilution ratio). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ?

Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 196 \n \n\n \n\nComparative results\n[ 404]\n\n indicate that the boundary-layer and Navier-Stokes models are \n\nin good agreement over a wide range of flow conditions. The plug flow model, however, must \n\nbe used with caution. Under some flow conditions, when chemical reactions are mass-transfer \n\nlimited, plug-flow models can significantly overpredict the conversion rates of fuel and/or \n\noxidant. Thus, in some situations, the range of applicability of these models is critically limited \n\nif accuracy is sought to be achieved. Still according to Raja et al.\n[ 404]\n\n the validity of the \n\nboundary-layer approximations improve as the Reynolds number increases. Under these \n\ncircumstances, the axial diffusive transport is diminished in comparison to the radial diffusion \n\nand convective transport. On the other hand, as Reynolds number decreases, the stream-wise \n\ndiffusion strengthens relative to convection. Mathematically, the character of the governing \n\nequations would change from parabolic to elliptic and, in this case, the accuracy of the \n\nboundary-layer approximation can be expected to decrease. Latter in this section, two \n\nboundary-layer models will be shortly addressed, namely the radial flow reactor (RFR) and \n\nstagnation flow reactor (SFR). \n\n \n\nPlug-flow equations (plug flow reactor model or just PFR) eliminate all diffusive terms \n\nand therefore any boundary-layer physics. In the axial direction, diffusion is assumed to be \n\nsmall compared to axial convective transport (much the same assumption as in the boun dary-\n\nlayer approximation). In the radial direction, however, diffusive transport (\u201ccrosswise mixing\u201d) is \n\nassumed to be over dominant, thereby resulting in no radial variations in species composition. \n\nThe plug-flow equation of continuity for the  -th species may be written as: \n\n (     )\n\n  \n=\n\n  \n  \n\n     ? ,  =\n  \n  \n\n   ( ? ,  \n     ? ,  \n\n    \n  \n  \n\n  ? ,  \n    ) (4.59) \n\n \n\nThis equation is analogous to Eq. (4.45a), with the following nuances: the molar basis \n\n(m   m?   ? ) source term    ?,   is now expressed by the sum of three source terms.  The term \n\n  ?,  \n    represents the net mass addition (or depletion) to (or from) the gas flow at wall surfaces\n\n21\n. \n\nIn the case that the walls of the channel are purely catalytic substrates (i.e., impermeable and \n\nwithout mass deposition or etching reactions), there is no net mass exchange and thus this \n\nterm vanishes identically (obviously, this is not the situation of SOFC gas channels). The terms \n\n  ?,  \n    and   ?,  \n\n     represent the production (or depletion) of the  -th gas-phase species by surface \n\n                                                      \n21\n\n The net mass exchange can arise as a result of non-catalytic surface reactions (mass deposition or etching) \nand from flow through permeable walls (i.e., suction or injection).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 197 \n \n\nand gas-phase reactions in the channel, respectively.   ?,  \n     only accounts for the production \n\n(or consumption) due to homogeneous reactions within the bulk volume of gas-phase. For \n\nSOFCs, the usual case is to have   ?,  \n   =   ?,  \n\n    = 0. In order to evaluate   ?,  \n    and   ?,  \n\n   , surface \n\nconvection-diffusion equations can be solved on active wall surfaces with suitable coupling to \n\nthe bulk species concentrations. One sees, therefore, that    ?,   is an \u201capparent bulk source \n\nterm\u201d: both convective and diffusive mass fluxes at the wall are converted to this apparent \n\nsource term.  \n\nOne should note that if the net mass flow in the gas channel is held constant (e.g., \n\n ? =      = c    .), then as the species composition changes the density and velocity will \n\nvary accordingly. If  ? is not constant, besides a constitutive equation of state, an extra axial \n\nmomentum equation would be required in order to solve the problem (see APPENDIX A), \n\nrigorously speaking. In this case an additional source term, related to the net mass addition in \n\nthe channel, must be added to the axial momentum equation as well. This additional \n\n\u201cmomentum source term\u201d will be properly represented as a spurious mass source term in the \n\nequation continuity for the mean flow. Finally, it is also important to highlight that in the plug-\n\nflow model both    and   are mean values with no radial variations. That is, the PFR yields \n\nsolutions that should be considered as spatially averaged in the radial direction. Thus, in order \n\nto compare plug-flow solutions with results of Navier-Stokes or boundary-layer model it is \n\nnecessary to calculate radially averaged species compositions. For instance, at a given axial \n\nlocation the mass-weighted, radially averaged mass fraction can be calculated as\n[ 404]\n\n: \n\n ? =\n?           \n 0\n0\n\n?         \n 0\n0\n\n (4.60) \n\n \n\nAccording to Raja et al.\n [ 404]\n\n the plug flow model tends to overpredict reactions rates (at \n\nleast in the case originally studied by these authors, where only wall catalytic reactions were \n\nconsidered). The reason for that is the inherent, radially homogeneous \u201cnature\u201d (i.e., \n\nsimplifying assumption) of the plug flow model, which imposes an ideally intimate interaction \n\nbetween gas and surface. In a realistic depiction, however, the mass boundary-layer hinders \n\nthe mass transfer between gas and reactor\u2019s wall. Mass transfer coefficients can be used \n\nwithin the PFR framework to represent this \u201cresistance\u201d to mass transfer between the active \n\nsurface and the mean gas composition, improving the accuracy of the plug-flow model, Eq. \n\n(4.59). In other words, mass transfer coefficients can be used to approximate the resistance to \n\nspecies mass transport crosswise. Such technique is only useful when these coefficients can \n\nbe determined quantitatively or reliably estimated for a range of flow conditions. Nevertheless, \n\nfor problems involving complex chemistry at surfaces and relatively short channels, mass \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 198 \n \n\ntransfer coefficients are not easily correlated\n[ 33, 404]\n\n. For instance, Eq. (4.59)  may be modified \n\nas\n[ 404]\n\n: \n\n (     )\n\n  \n=\n\n  \n  \n\n   ( ? ,  , \n     \n\n  \n  \n\n  ? ,  \n    ) (4.61) \n\n \n\n ? ,  , \n    =   ? ,  , \n\n     ? ,  , \n    =\n\n     , \n  \n\n(  ,    , ?    ) (4.62) \n\n \n\nwhere   ?,  , \n     is the \u201ccorrected\u201d mass source term which accounts for the effects of mass \n\ntransfer resistance;      ,  is the mass transfer coefficient of the  -th species;   ,  is the \n\nmixture mass density of the gas, which is evaluated at the channel surface;     is the radially \n\naveraged mean mass density of the  -th species: \n\n   =  ?   ?   (4.63) \n\n \n\nwhere the radially averaged density   ? is calculated as \n\n  ? =\n?       \n 0\n0\n\n?     \n 0\n0\n\n ( 0 is the channel radius) (4.64) \n\n \n\nThe surface reaction rates   ?,  , \n    and   ?,  , \n\n    are now calculated using the gas-phase mass \n\nfractions evaluated at the surface (  , ). The species mass fractions are determined from Eq. \n\n(4.62), which is, in the general case, an implicit nonlinear algebraic relationship between \n\nheterogeneous reactions rates and the gas-phase composition at the surface.  It must be \n\nsolved simultaneously with the mass-continuity equation, Eq. (4.61). Generally, mass transfer \n\ncoefficients will be different for each species and will vary with respect to the axial position \n\nalong the channel length, i.e.,      , =      ,    . They can be determined from the \u201cfull \n\nsolution\u201d of the channel flow field (e.g., obtained via CFD) or fitted from experimental data, as: \n\n     , =\n  , \n\n(  ,    , ?    )\n=\n\n    ? ,  , \n     ? ,  , \n\n    \n\n(  ,    , ?    )\n   , ( = 1,2,        (4.65) \n\n \n\nwhere   ,  is the radial component of the species mass flux at the channel wall. Mass transfer \n\ncoefficients may also be represented in dimensionless form, using the species Sherwood \n\nnumber: \n\n   , =\n     ,   \n\n   \n  (4.66) \n\n \n\nwhere, in this case, the channel hydraulic diameter ( ) was used as the characteristic length \n\nscale for the mass transport process. It is expected that Sherwood numbers attain high values \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 199 \n \n\nat the channel\u2019s leading edge and decrease downstream the channel, toward an asymptotic \n\nvalue\n[ 404]\n\n.  \n\nThe high initial value of    ,  is associated with the very thin mass boundary-layer that \n\nbegin to develop at the active leading edge\n22\n\n. For simple boundary conditions, the Sherwood \n\nnumber should decrease monotonically to an asymptotic value far downstream. For relatively \n\nmore complex surface chemistry, however, it is unlikely that      ,  possess a simple \n\nmonotonic behavior. Furthermore, for high Reynolds numbers the chemistry behavior will tend \n\nto persist farther into the channel, as a result of which the Sherwood number may not \n\napproach its asymptotic value by the channel exit (i.e., within the fixed channel length). A \n\ngeneralized correlation between the Sherwood number and nondimenional groups that \n\ncharacterizes the flow (e.g., the reciprocal of the Graetz number) can be devised as\n[ 397, 398]\n\n: \n\n   , =\n \n\n \n        \n\n       \n  (4.67) \n\n \n\nwhere  ,  , and   are empirical parameters  and the species Schmidt number may be \n\nevaluated as \n\n   =\n  \n\n   \n  (4.68) \n\n \n\nSuch correlation can be derived for laminar flows with constant gas-phase composition at the \n\nsurface or for constant surface reaction rates\n[ 162, 33]\n\n. However, for problems involving complex \n\nchemistry and concurrent transport phenomena is most probable that no general Sherwood \n\nnumber correlation can be found. \n\nIn the particular case studied by Raja et al., these authors suggested the adoption of \n\npractical bounds to evaluate the range within which the plug-flow assumptions should be valid: \n\n \n\n \n           \n\n \n\n \n or 1           (\n\n \n\n \n)\n \n\n (4.69) \n\n \n\nWhere   is a characteristic length scale of the flow problem. Some analysis is required \n\nconcerning the precise definition of this length scale. If this length scale comprehends the \n\nentire channel length, then a complete \u201cchemical reaction plus transport\u201d event appears to \n\noccur within a very small distance from the leading edge of the channel. In this situation, \n\nconcentration profiles will be nearly vertical (see, for example, Fig. 4.9), which is really what \n\nthe plug-flow assumption is about (i.e., good results on the scale of the channel length). on the \n\nother hand, if the region of interest lies in the vicinity of leading edge, then the axial length \n\n                                                      \n22\n\n The hydrodynamic boundary-layer begins to develop immediately as the unreacted flow enters the channel. A \nmass boundary-layer starts to grow as soon as mass transfer rates are meaningfully different from zero. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 200 \n \n\nscale of interest will be much smaller than the channel length. In this case, the plug-flow model \n\nis expected to be rather inaccurate at this reduced length scale. \n\nIn the SOFC literature, virtually all published works that have applied the PFR to model \n\nthe gas channel have disregarded the effect of mass transfer resistance and many of the \n\nremarks that have been made above. Examples to the contrary are really scarce. An exception \n\nworth noting is the work of Nagel et al.\n[ 410]\n\n. These authors noted that depending on the \n\ngeometry of the gas channel, the diffusion of the reacting species from the bulk gas to the \n\ncatalyst surface can be slower than the actual chemical reaction. In this situation, the partial \n\npressures of the reactants at the catalyst surface can differ significantly from that found in the \n\nbulk of gas-phase, thereby requiring that these partial pressures should be obtained from the \n\nsolution of the complete concentration field, perpendicular to the gas flow. Nagel et al. \n\nproposed an alternative approach to avoid solving the corresponding full set of partial \n\ndifferential equations, in which a mass transfer analogy is used to compute the reactant partial \n\npressure at the catalyst surface: \n\n  ? ,  =   ,    ?     \n    \n\n \n\n?      \n with   ,    ?    =\n\n  ,        ,    \n  ,        ,    \n\n (4.70) \n\n \n\n  ,    =   ? ,  , \n     ? ,  , \n\n     \n?      \n    \n\n \n (4.71) \n\n \n\n  ,     =    \n   \n \n\n (\n \n\n ?   \n) (4.72) \n\n \n\nwhere    is the partial pressure of the diffusion-limited specie;   is the chemical reaction order \n\nassociated with the diffusion-limited specie;    is the Nusselt number obtained from an \n\nsuitable correlation\n[ 396, 399, 402]\n\n for the for the geometry and flow conditions considered. \n\n \n\nThe so-called radial flow reactors or RFR\n[ 33]\n\n are a class of chemical reactors, widely \n\nused in different scientific and industrial segments. A prominent example of this class is the \n\nchemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) reactor (axisymmetric, finite-gap stagnation flow reactors are \n\nalso recurrently used to model CVDs, depending on their specific design). In these reactors, \n\nprocess gases flow radially outward (or inward) across parallel plates, i.e., \u201cradially diverging \n\n(or conversing) flow between parallel discs\u201d. The different designs of this type of reactor may \n\nbe studied as radial variations of Jeffery-Hamel flows\n[ 411, 33]\n\n, because the application of the \n\nJeffery-Hamel similarity represents an often used mathematical simplification of the relatively \n\nmore complex 3D flow in real production reactors. In the specific case of button-type SOFCs, \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 201 \n \n\ndepending on the geometrical design parameters of the fuel channel, the RFR model might be \n\nused to approximate the flow conditions of the system. In the SOFC literature there are few \n\nstudies\n[ 412, 413]\n\n that have made use of experimental setups resembling the radial flow reactor. \n\nNevertheless, the respective numerical simulations of these setups, when available, have been \n\naccomplished either by means of plug-flow model\n[ 414]\n\n or, more recently, using CFD approach\n[ \n\n415]\n.   \n\nStagnation flow reactor (SFR) models\n[ 33]\n\n seldom have been used by the SOFC \n\ncommunity to simulate button-cells\n[ 416]\n\n. The practical application of these models is more \n\ncommon in the simulation of CVD or catalytic combustion bench reactors\n[ 417, 34, 418]\n\n. The SFR \n\nmodel can be viewed as a similarity reduction of flow equations in a boundary-layer, in which \n\nthe governing and constitutive equations reduce to systems of ODE boundary-value problems.  \n\nWhat is particularly interesting to note is that, similarly to what is addressed in this section, in \n\nthese other fields (e.g., modeling of CVD processes) there has been discussions on the \n\nlimitations of generally employed models\n[ 417]\n\n for properly describing the physics that occurs \n\nwithin the gas channel, depending on the experimental configurations employed. Moreover, \n\nhow the combination between experimental configurations, operating conditions (that, for \n\ninstance, can lead to mass transfer limited chemical reactions), and unsuitable mathematical \n\nmodels can result in illusive conclusions, such as the \u201cmasking\u201d of real reaction rates and \n\nkinetic parameters\n[ 34]\n\n. That is, how mass transfer effects can mask the intrinsic reactivity at \n\ntypical gas-phase conditions. Thus, depending on the specific goals of a research work, is of \n\nutmost importance verifying if more accurate models, such as those based on boundary-layer \n\napproximations, are indeed necessary and \u201coversimplified\u201d descriptions, such as plug-flow \n\nmodels, should be abandoned accordingly. \n\nIt is relevant mention that the boundary-layer models as usually found in the literature \n\nare set for conditions wherein there is no net mass exchange in the gas-phase (e.g. , the SFR \n\nmodel is based on the Hiemenz equations with no-slip velocity boundary condition at the wall). \n\nThus, if one expects   ?,  \n    to have an important effect on the boundary-layer hydrodynamics \n\n(i.e., coupling of mass transport and momentum equations), these models will need \n\nmodification.  \n\n \n\nAs already introduced in \u00a7\u00a74.3.2, Kulikovsky\n[ 255]\n\n developed an analytical model that \n\ntakes into account the effect of fuel utilization along the gas channel of a planar SOF C anode \n\n(see Fig. 3.8), under the assumption of plug-flow conditions. This model is based on the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 202 \n \n\nframework described in \u00a7\u00a74.3.1 and in APPENDIX A. The    consumption in the channel was \n\ndescribed by the following bass balance equation: \n\n  \n   2\n  \n\n= ?\n \n\n2      \n   ,   2  = 0 =   2\n\n    ,  \n (4.73) \n\n \n\nwhere      is the height of the channel. This ODE was rewritten in a dimensionless form as: \n\n        ?   \n  ?\n\n  ?\n= ?\n\n ?    ?   ?\n\n   ?  ( ?    ?? )\n  ?\n\n   ,  ?  ? = 0 = 1 (4.74) \n\n \n\nUsing the following dimensionless variables (and scaling parameters): \n\n ? =\n \n\n   \n ,  ? =\n\n \n\n   \n ,  ? =\n\n  2\n\n  2\n    ,  \n\n ,  ? =\n \n\n     \n ,    ? =\n\n         \n   \n\n (4.75) \n\n \n\nwhere     is the channel length;   2\n   is the inlet hydrogen molar concentration;       is given by \n\n     = ?2           ; the hydrogen stoichiometry       was defined as \n\n     =\n2           2\n\n  \n\n        \n (4.76) \n\n \n\nAnd the overall (or area-specific) current density was evaluated as: \n\n  ?  = ?  ?   ?\n \n\n0\n\n (4.77) \n\n \n\nThe area specific resistivity      accumulates all resistivities, except the anodic one, \n\nand is assumed to be independent of local cell current and thus independent of  ?. In a similar \n\nfashion to the developments of the active layer analytical model in \u00a7\u00a74.3.1, Kulikovsky \n\nobtained solutions for Eq. (4.73) in the limiting situations of high and low current density \n\nregimes (the author also derived their respective polarization curves). For instance, in the case \n\nof low current density, the solution of Eq. Eq. (4.73) was given as: \n\n ?  ? =\n1\n\n   ? \n 0?? ?    ? ?       ?

( ?    ?? )\n  ?\n\n (4.79) \n\n \n\nThis analytical model developed by Kulikovsky\n[ 255]\n\n should provide a straightforward way to \n\nrationalize the effect of hydrogen utilization (  ) on the anodic polarization. This model \n\nindicates that, within both high and low current density regimes, voltage losses increases \n\nrapidly for fuel utilizations    above 80%, dramatically worsening the anode performance.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 203 \n \n\nUnfortunately, however, there is a critical error in Kulikovsky\u2019s model, utterly \n\ncompromising its validity. More precisely, there is error in the assumption concerning his \u201cEq. \n\n(44)\u201d, where the author states that the equipotential condition leads to \n\n ? =  ?   ?  ?    =  ?   ?    ? = c        (4.80) \n\n \n\nThe \u201cequipotentiality assumption\u201d (see \u00a7\u00a72.2.2), however, only refers to  ?     as being constant \n\nand not  ?   ?  ?    .  Indeed, as more fuel is utilized the value of  ?     changes along the gas \n\nchannel and this remains so even if there is no concentration polarization within the porous \n\nelectrode (as has been also assumed in Kulikovsky\u2019s derivations), because  ?     itself is \n\nevaluated at \u201cbulk gas conditions\u201d.  That is,  ?   =  ?     ?  ?   and it should also have been a \n\nfunction of     concentration, e.g., see Eq. (2.15). Thus, in this case Kulikovsky also \n\ndisregarded the influence of steam concentration on both fuel utilization and SOFC \n\nperformance. \n\n \n\n \n\n                     \n\n \n\n\n\n 1, 2, 3,  4,  5,  6, 7,  8,  9, 10 , 11, 12, 1 3, 14, 15 , 16, 17, 18, 19, 2 0, 21, 22, 23, 24, 2 5, 26, 27 , 28, 29, 3 0, 31, 32 , 33, 34, 35, 36, 3 7, 38, 39, 40,  41, 42 , 43, 44, 45, 46, 4 7, 48, 49, 50, 51, 5 2, 53, 54 , 55, 56,  5 7, 58, 59, 60, 61, 6 2, 63, 64 , 65, 66, 6 7, 68, 69 , 70, 71, 7 2, 73, 7 4  \n\nThe scope of this dissertation has hitherto been mostly limited to the critical review of \n\nexisting modeling techniques, although some novel research developments and results have \n\nalso been presented in Chapter 3 (see \u00a7\u00a73.3). For instance, this author\u2019s dissertation \n\nconcluded from thermostatics considerations and macroscale-continuum phenomenological \n\nequations that the definition of concentration polarization, as commonly found in the literature, \n\nmay contain a series of limitations. It has been also discussed the relative importance of \n\noxygen surface ad-ions on the formation of concentration cells when it is compared to the \n\nmore significant concentration gradients of gas species in the porous channels of SOFC \n\ncathodes. While the reasoning behind this discussion is coherent from the macroscopic point \n\nof view, the conclusions concerning these surface effects must still be amended. Therefore, as \n\nfor now they should be regarded as thought-provoking insights into the potential influence of \n\ncontact chemistry near the TPB region. \n\nMore generally, this dissertation discussed a number of issues related to the \n\nmathematical modeling of concentration polarization in high-temperature SOFCs, with focus on \n\nthe relation between the rate of mass transfer of electroactive species and (possible) \n\nconcentration-induced voltage losses, which may arise within the electrochemical cell as a \n\nresult of transport-related limitations. In particular, this research has been motivated by the \n\nnecessity of raising awareness about the theoretical limitations of existing models that are \n\npresently applied in the technical literature (above all, considering what was discussed in \n\n\u00a7\u00a73.6). In other words, this work has been driven by the seemingly lack of consistency among \n\ngoverning equations and constitutive relations, specifically those that are based on a \n\nphenomenological macroscale-continuum setting. In doing so, this work tried to show that the \n\nmajority of SOFC numerical simulations performed to date, concerning concentration \n\npolarization, ignore model checking as a critical step for rigorous validation of both simulation \n\nand experimental results. This insufficient (or inadequate) model checking also reveals, on the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 ? Conclusions and Outlook 205 \n \n\nother hand, that physical models lack proper scrutiny about their simplifying assumptions and \n\nthus about their reliability (see, for example, \u00a7\u00a7A.5). As a result of this, it seems that certain \n\ndetailed multiscale models can behave as much as \u201cblack box\u201d models, despite of their \n\napparent mathematical complexity (e.g., as it is the case of some articles that have been \n\npublished on recent years, which applied the Lattice-Boltzmann-Method in structure-resolved \n\nsimulations of SOFC porous layers). Thus, from this perspective, to skip model checking \n\namounts to bringing about illusory conclusions, which raise confusion and controversial \n\nperceptions on the apparent success of these models. \n\nHopefully, the issues discussed in this work should open up a perspective towards \n\nneeded improvements in the direction of more consistent (and reliable) mathematical models, \n\nincluding comprehensive and rigorous comparison between simulations and experimental \n\ndata, a praxis that is presently missing for the type of problems that have been addressed \n\nherein. When building the necessary models, future developments should offer a theoretical \n\nassessment of multicomponent mass transfer in the so-called idealized \u201ccapillary pore spaces\u201d, \n\nwhich are used as an abstraction for the pore-level information in phenomenological models. \n\nThrough a concerted description of what (supposedly) occurs at the pore level, one expects \n\nthat it will make apparent the flagrant oversimplifications (i.e., misrepresentations of transport \n\nprocesses) made by several SOFC models, permitting a more accurate picture of cell \n\nmacroscale performance. Due to the aforementioned limitations placed by (possibly) not \n\nconsidering physically relevant phenomena in the numerical simulation of SOFCs, it would be \n\nof great interest to study the following topics in future research projects: \n\nI. Discuss important issues related to equation physical scaling, when \u201cmatching\u201d \n\nmacroscale-continuum and pore-level mesoscale descriptions (i.e., coarse-\n\ngraining of subgrid-scale processes in governing equations and closure relations). \n\nFor instance, the effect of mass density variations over distances comparable to \n\npore dimensions in the development of macroscale models. \n \n\nII.

Here this model is first presented in its original form (with \n\nrespect to the definition given to \u201c \u201d by that author), and then modifications and the reasoning \n\nfor such modifications are discussed. In \u00a7\u00a72.3.3 and \u00a7\u00a72.3.4 it was brought to light a number \n\nof questions concerning the reaction penetration depth parameter and the meaning of \u201c \u201d. At \n\nthis point some of Kulikovsky\u2019s implied assumptions are pinpointed and the conceptual \n\n\u201cimprecisions\u201d of his model revealed. Analytical models are derived for the particular cases of \n\nideal ionic transport and ideal gas-phase transport, and for each of these cases the limiting \n\nsituations of high and low current density are considered for further simplifications. \n\nKulikovsky\n[12, 107]\n\n starts with the following system of equations, which governs the active layer \n\nperformance: \n\n    ( )\n\n  \n    \n\n ( )     \n  (     ? )\n\n \n*   (\n\n   \n\n  \n)     (\n\n(   )  \n\n  \n)+ (A.13) \n\n \n\n         \n  ( )\n\n  \n (A.14) \n\n \n\n  \n  ( )\n\n  \n \n     \n    \n\n (A.15) \n\n \n\nwhere   is the coordinate along the active layer thickness (note that on Figure 2.10 it is \n\ndirected from the electrolyte to the anode out layer);   \n  is the volumetric exchange current \n\ndensity;      is a reference molar concentration of feed gas;   is the reaction order in respect \n\nto feed gas;   is the half-cell (e.g., anodic) overvoltage;     is the effective conductivity of \n\nelectrolyte phase in the active layer;   is the effective diffusion coefficient of feed gas within \n\nthe porous channels of the active layer; and   is a charge transfer coefficient.  \n\nAccording to Kulikovsky, Eq. (A.13) expresses the decay of ionic current with   at a rate \n\ngiven by Butler\u2013Volmer electrode kinetics (RHS of this equation); Eq. (A.14) states that Ohm's \n\nlaw is valid for the electrolyte phase, relating the ionic current to the overvoltage gradient; Eq. \n\n(A.15) is a material balance that establishes\n1\n that the local diffusion flux of feed gas is equal to \n\nthe local electronic current density (        ) to be converted through the half-cell \n\nelectrochemical reaction (molar flux of ions to be converted into free electrons); and the \n\nstoichiometry factor      in Eq. (A.15) does the conversion of current density to molar flux. \n\n                                                      \n1\n Kulikovsky did not mention, but it is also implied that the electrolyte boundary is impermeable to feed gas in \n\norder to derive Eq. (A.15). \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 212 \n \n\nThe RHS of Eq. (A.13) can be further simplified. The first exponential describes the \n\nforward electrochemical conversion (e.g., hydrogen oxidation reaction) while the second \n\nexponential represents the reverse reaction. This reverse reaction lowers the overall rate of \n\nconversion in near equilibrium situations (   ), when both exponentials in Eq. (A.13) are of \n\nthe same order of magnitude. Now, If one assumes that the active layer operates far from \n\nequilibrium (i.e.,     (  )? ), then the second exponential may be ignored. Or, alternatively \n\nand in order to simplify the calculations, the transfer coefficient may be adopted\n2\n as     \n\n     . The latter option will be used herein. It is worth while noting that, under the Butler\u2013\n\nVolmer formalism, the constraint       is important within the region of small current \n\ndensities, wherein both exponentials contributes to the activation polarization. At larger \n\ncurrents (SOFC \u201coperating far from equilibrium\u201d), however, the second exponential is negligible \n\nand hence the value of   in Eq. (A.13) is of minor importance, even though it should still be \n\nconsistent (that is, its value is not arbitrary, as asserted by some authors in the literature). \n\nEquation (A.13) can now be rewritten as: \n\n    ( )\n\n  \n    \n\n  (     ? )\n \n[   (    ? )     (     ? )]       \n\n  (     ? )\n \n    (    ? ) (A.16) \n\n \n\nWhere \n\n    \n   \n\n   \n (A.17) \n\n \n\nis the Tafel slope. To nondimensionalize Eq. (A.14), (A.15), and (A.16), the following \n\ndimensionless variables are introduced: \n\n ?  \n \n\n  \n    ?  \n\n \n\n   \n    ?  \n\n \n\n  \n    ?   \n\n      \n       \n\n (A.18) \n\n \n\nwhere    is the feed gas concentration at the active layer/outlet layer interface (at    ?   , \n\naccording to Fig, 2.10). Note that hereafter the subscripts \u201c \u201d and \u201c \u201d will mark the values at \n\n ?    and  ?   , respectively.

From the point of \n\nview of SOFC electrochemical performance, the polarization curve of the active layer, \n\nexpressed though the relation  ?   ?

The \n\n\u201ctotal\u201d voltage loss (polarization) is given by the value of    at the active layer/electrolyte \n\ninterface. The shape of the reaction rate,   \n ( ), is also relevant in that it might support the \n\noptimization of catalyst design (e.g., load distribution in terms of           ) within the \n\nelectrode. Even though analytical solution for the system (A.19)-(A.21) is as yet unknown, for \n\nthe two limiting cases of (i) ideal ionic transport or (ii) ideal gas-phase transport explicit \n\nanalytical solutions can be derived. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the case of ideal ionic transport, Kulikovsky assumes that the overvoltage gradient is \n\nvanishing small (  ?   ) and thus that, in the system (A.19)-(A.21), the approximation  ?   ?  \n\nis valid (in \u00a7\u00a72.3.4 it was shown that this assumption is not consistent at all).

When the gas diffusivity is relatively small (i.e., \n\nlarge  ) electrochemical conversion occurs within a small region near the active layer/outer \n\nlayer interface, in which the reacting gas is, still, in excess (see Fig. A-1).

It is \n\nonly mentioned that the quantity  ?  follows from Eq. (A.34), considering that this equation \n\ndictates the rate of decay of  ?  ( ?).

Therefore, the axial momentum \n\nequation in Janardhanan et al.\n[298]\n\n is really an artifact introduced by the under-relaxation \n\nprocedure used for the numerical solution of the system of equations. \n\n                                                      \n4\n Note that if the mean gas composition varies in the (mean) flow direction, the viscosity   may also vary axially \n\nalong the channel length. Therefore, in the general case, the mean wall shear stress may also not be constant \nthroughout the channel. \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 226 \n \n\n \n\nThe \u201cextended version\u201d of Bosanquet formula provided in Table 4.15\n[313]\n\n, when \n\ncompared to its classical form\n[62]\n\n, is a artifice a few authors in the literature have been using as \n\na \u201cnon-rigorous\u201d method to avoid the violation of gas species mass conservation. Although the \n\nconditions under which it should be applied, its apparent validity, and its mathematical \n\nderivation has not been openly discussed (e.g., see [72, 313]), it is most likely that the use of \n\nan \u201caveraged Bosanquet diffusion coefficient\u201d is justified in the cases where the assumption of \n\nconstant total pressure is incorrectly enforced in the presence of chemical reactions (which, in \n\nthis case, produce a net change in the total number density of gas species). Below it is given a \n\npossible explanation for the origin for such \u201ccorrected formula\u201d for the case of a ternary gas \n\nmixture.  \n\nThe simpler EPDM model of Virkar and coauthors (see \u00a7\u00a7 4.4.2) will be employed in \n\nthis attempt of explanation, starting from Eq. (4.15a), (4.15b), and (4.18), which at this point \n\nassume that the microstructure of porous electrodes is not a function of position and thus that \n\n   \n    is composition-independent. As the saturation current is also a function of the hydrogen \n\nconcentration at bulk conditions, it is convenient to define an effective anodic transport \n\nmultiplier (   ) as: \n\n    \n   \n\n   \n   \n (\n\n    \n     \n\n       \n)\n   \n\n ?\n   \n ( )\n\n   ( )     ( )\n\n   \n\n \n\n    (A.88) \n\n \n\nwith \n\n   \n    \n\n       \n\n   \n \n\n \n   \n\n[   \n     (       )? ]   \n\n (A.89) \n\n \n\nThe factor     is akin to that of Virkar\n[82]\n\n, with the exception that in this case the diffusion \n\ncoefficient is also admitted to be a function of position (i.e.,     is not composition-independent \n\nand thus it might also vary along the layer thickness). It is an approximate average based on \n\nthe \u201cmean value\u201d of    \n  (       )?  in the interval [     ]. By assuming only diffusive mass \n\ntransport mechanism, from Eq. (4.14), (4.41), and (A.88) one may express the limiting molar \n\nflux as \n\n ?       \n    \n  \n\n \n   \n    \n\n      \n (   )\n\n     \n     (A.90) \n\n \n\nThe factor     may be seen as the reciprocal of an \u201ceffective mass transfer coefficient\u201d in the \n\nvery special situation (or rather, assumption) in which the interfacial partial pressure of \n\nhydrogen reaches zero at current saturation condition (i.e., zero gas concentration at the \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 227 \n \n\nanode/electrolyte interface). If one now defines    \n       (  )? , Eq. (A.88) and (A.89) can \n\nbe rewritten as: \n\n   \n   \n\n    \n        \n\n     (A.91) \n\n \n\n    \n   \n\n     \n        \n\n     (A.92) \n\n \n\nFor a ternary gas system under approximately constant total pressure (there is an \n\nerror in this assumption), the composition profile of an inert gas (e.g.,   ,   ,    ) may \n\ncalculated as\n[82]\n\n: \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n       \n  \n\n \n ?     \n\n      \n  \n\n \n    ?             ?  \n(      \n\n ? )         \n \n     ?             ?   \n\n(      \n ? )           \n\n (A.93) \n\n \n\nBecause the net flow of the inert gas is zero ( ?       ) and  ?     ?    in steady state \n\n(another common misleading assumption made in the literature), Eq.

Therefore, this \n\naspect should be taken into consideration in the evaluation of    diffusion coefficient when it is \n\nnot independent of position. Similarly to the case of inert gas in Eq.
