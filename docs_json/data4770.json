Coutinho\nABSTRACT\nThe Bauru Basin (Upper Cretaceous) accumulated an essentially sandy continental sedimentary sequence. In a first desertic phase the basaltic substratum was covered by a widespread and homogeneous aeolian sand unit with minor loess intercalations. The substratum relief favored the formation of an endorheic drainage system under semi-arid climate, a process that started the development of the Ara\u00e7atuba Paleoswamp. The palustrine deposits (Ara\u00e7atuba Formation) comprise siltstone and tipically greenish gray narrow tabular strata of sandstone cemented by carbonate. Moulds and gypsite and dolomite pseudomorphs were identified. The moulds seem to be genetically associated with desiccation cracks, root marks and climbing ripple lamination levels, that, on the whole, indicate calm shallow saline waters undergoing phases of subaerial exposition. At the boundaries of the study area, sand units may exhibit sigmoidal features and convolute bedding structure, which is characteristic of marginal deltaic deposits. The Ara\u00e7atuba Formation is enclosed in and later overlaid by the aeolian deposits of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation.\nKey words: Ara\u00e7atuba, Cretaceous, Bauru, swamp, palustrine, continental.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Ara\u00e7atuba Formation spreads over the mid-west of S\u00e3o Paulo State, along the valleys of the Tiet\u00ea, Aguape\u00ed and Feio rivers, and their tributaries, in the Ara\u00e7atuba region (Figure 1). This formation belongs to the lower part of the Bauru Group, which, together with the Caiu\u00e1 Group, forms the Upper Cretaceous Sedimentary Sequence (Figure 2). This succession filled the Bauru Basin, a depression developed by the subsidence of the South American\nCorrespondence to: Luiz A. Fernandes\nE-mail: lufernandes@ufpr.br\nPlatform southern-central part due to the accumulation of an almost 2000m thick layers of basaltic lava. This intracratonic basin was formed during the Upper Cretaceous, after the split of the Gond-wana Continent. Once the Lower Cretaceous volcanic activities came to an end, the area where the basin would ultimately set remained exposed until, during the Upper Cretaceous, a relative subsidence dropped the base level and allowed the accumulation and preservation of interior sediments. The basin was filled with an essentially sandy sedimentary succession, with an average a thickness of 100 to 200 meters, which is currently preserved and spread out\nin an area of roughly 370,000 km2. The maximum thickness recorded for the sequence is 320 meters (Mezzalira et al. 1981).\nThe basement consists of Lower Cretaceous Serra Geral Formation volcanic rocks (mainly basalts), from which the sedimentary succession is separated by an erosive regional surface (nonconformity). Its upper erosive limit is demarcated by the Sul-Americana (King 1956) / Japi Surface (Almeida 1964) or by the posterior dissection of this surface.\nTHE ARA\u00c7ATUBA UNIT\nThe knowledge regarding the sedimentary succession which composed the sedimentary filling of the Bauru Basin evolved in four main phases as listed by Fernandes (1998): 1) pioneer phase (1905 to the early forties); 2) characterization phase (fifties and sixties); 3) lithostratigraphic regional mapping phase (seventies and early eighties); and 4) current phase.\nThe name Ara\u00e7atuba that appeared during the regional cartography (phase 3) was previously used by Suguio et al. (1977) to designate a lithofacies (facies association) in the former Bauru Formation. Zaine et al. (1980, Paulipetro Report BP-014/80, unpublished) singled out a unit which they called Ara\u00e7atuba Formation, in an unpublished report of regional mapping. The author, however, did not formally define the unit. Soares et al. (1979) outlined a proposal for the S\u00e3o Paulo State Cretaceous units where the Bauru unit was introduced as a group composed of four formations corresponding to the following units: a) Caiu\u00e1 Formation; b) Santo Anast\u00e1cio Facies; c) the assemblage: Lithofacies Ara-\u00e7atuba-Taciba Facies-Ubirajara Facies; d) Mar\u00edlia Lithofacies or Formation. Soares et al. (1980) formally defined the Bauru Group as composed of the Caiu\u00e1, Santo Anast\u00e1cio, Adamantina and Mar\u00edlia formations. Almeida et al. (1980) adopted the Soares et al. (1979) proposition and divided the Adamantina Formation into five units for mapping purposes. Suguio (1981), when covering the paleo-environmental and paleogeographic aspects of the\nBauru Group, brought back the designation Ara\u00e7atuba and subdivided the group into six formations: Caiu\u00e1, Santo Anast\u00e1cio, Ara\u00e7atuba, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, Uberaba and Mar\u00edlia. Fernandes and Coimbra (1994, 1996) divided the \u2018\u2018Neocretaceous suprabasaltic sequence\u201d into two partially coeval groups: Caiu\u00e1 (Paran\u00e1 River, Goio Er\u00ea and Santo Anast\u00e1cio formations) and Bauru (Uberaba, Adamantina and Mar\u00edlia formations; besides the Tai\u00fava Analcimites).\nThe Ara\u00e7atuba Formation (Fernandes and Coimbra 1998, 2000a), conception adopted here, corresponds partially to the Ara\u00e7atuba Lithofacies of Suguio et al. (1977), and also partially to the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation of Suguio (1981), Ara\u00e7atuba Formation of Zaine et al. (1980, unpublished); and Adamantina Formation\u2019s Kalil unit, of Almeida et al. (1980).\nCHARACTERIZATION OF THE ARA\u00c7ATUBA FORMATION\nThe Ara\u00e7atuba unit presents a maximum thickness of 70 meters (Brandt Neto 1977, Zaine et al. 1980, unpublished), and is well exposed on cuts of the Marechal Rondon highway (SP 300) in the Ara-\u00e7atuba region. The unit is composed by siltstones and very fine sandstones, exhibiting a characteristic greenish-gray color. These are arranged in tabular beds of massive aspect and are usually centimeters to decimeters thick, but may reach 1 meter (Figure 3a and b). At the boundaries of the occurrence area, the sandy strata may display sigmoidal shapes (Figure 3c). The strata makeup is composed of submetric overlapping sandy bodies, in vertical successions that go up to 7 meters. Boundaries and/or internal low angle sigmoidal bedding can also be observed (e.g. highway BR 153, km 112.5). The sigmoidal features correspond to approximate longitudinal sections of amalgamated lobes.\nCarbonatic cement is a frequent component of the sandstone in the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation and occurs frequently as horizontal tabular crusts running parallel to the rock-bedding. Despite the general massive appearance, the layers can show discreet\nBauru Basin localization\n11 H2D3 \u25a14B5B6D7^8E19\nKEY: 1 .Serra Geral Fm. (uK basement); 2.

Etchebehere et al. (1991) also describe several millimetric rhombshaped molds and some centimetric radial fibrous structures in the Tiet\u00ea River valley, east of Ara\u00e7atu-ba. They were interpreted as probable gypsite crystal molds. Fernandes (1998) reported the finding of radial fibrous crystal molds with diameters ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters, in road cuts of the SP 300 (km 548.5; Ara\u00e7atuba), SP 461 (km 40.1; Brejo Alegre) and SP 304 (close to km 412) highways. In the last one crystal molds occur one centimeter above root casts, a fact that suggests phases exposure. At the entrance to Brejo Alegre, laminated pelites contain crystal molds interlaid with crosslaminated siltstones (traction structures from a tranquil flow regime). Such features characterize saline shallow calm water during periods of drought. Mud cracks have been observed in a lateral road pave\nment, 2.2 km away from the SP 272, on the road that links it to Tarabai.\nIllite and smectite are the most frequent clay minerals in the Bauru Basin. Kaolinite, mixed layer clays (illite-smectite) and chlorite appear less frequently. Most of the identified illite is apparently of clastic origin, although sometimes it may occur as an authigenic mineral. Smectite often appears as pore-lining cement, and may be replaced by authigenic kaolinite during surface processes (Fernandes et al. 1994). Corrensite has also been found in the Ara^atuba Formation in pore lining (Figure 4c). These secondary clay minerals were formed probably between the sedimentation and initial diagenetic processes under conditions of little water circulation and/or a semi-arid climate.\nThe suprabasaltic Neocretaceous sequence reached the initial stages of mesodiagenesis (Fernandes et al. 1994). The main diagenetic transformations included mechanical compaction, incipient chemical compaction, pressure solution of unstable\nFig. 3 (photos) - a) A common aspect in Ara\u00e7atuba Formation: parallel bedding units of very fine sandstones and siltstones, with characteristic greenish-gray color.

Mezzalira (1974) recorded the occurrence of con-chostraca molds and Fernandes (1998) found con-chostraca in a sample taken from a road cut of Alfredo Marcondes highway - SP 294, km 72.2, north of Flora Rica (Figure 4d). Vertical tubular features in mudstones were also found and interpreted as being root casts (Figure 4a). They reach a maximum diameter of 0.5 cm and the lengths vary from 10 to 30 cm, toppedby flat surfaces. They canbe observed on the highways SP 300, km 548.5 (Arajatuba), SP\n425, km 292.9 (Pen\u00e1polis), Alfredo Marcondes -SP 294, km 72.2 (north of Flora Rica) and SP 304, around km 412.\nTYPE-SECTION\nThe Ara\u00e7atuba designation was mentioned as being lithofacies by Suguio et al. (1977) and corresponded to parts of the Santo Anast\u00e1cio and Vale do Rio do Peixe units (Fernandes and Coimbra, 1998) but was also known as a formation (e.g. Suguio 1981). In the first type-section informally proposed forthe unit, Barcelos (1984) presented the Ara\u00e7atuba unit as an Adamantina Formation member. The author located the section in a road cut of the highway BR 153, close to the right bank of the Tiet\u00ea\nRiver. This place however presents itself in unver-ifiable conditions. In its place, a reference section was postulated in the highway SP 300 (figures 3b and 5), in a road cut located near Ara\u00e7atuba (km 548.5; UTM: 541659/7655764). Complementary sections include road cuts in the highway SP 425, km 348.7, close to the entrance to Piacatu (UTM: 542015/7602721), in the Aguape\u00ed River valley, and in the highway SP 333, km 224 (close to Promiss\u00e3o Dam). In the last one, bodies of sigmoidal geometry can be observed (Figure 3c), thereby completing the characteristics indicated for the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation.\nAra\u00e7atuba Fm.\nsand\nRF parallel bedding\nI I massive\ncarbonate crusts\nFig. 5 - Arajatuba Formation type-section.

It interdigitates laterally and vertically with the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation that overlays them regionally (Figure 6). This positioning indicates a gradual transgression by aeolian sediments that progressed until the filling of the former inner swamp. Though well defined and rugged, the contact between the Vale do Rio do Peixe and Ara\u00e7atuba formations is flat and devoid of ero-sional features. This characteristic is recurring and can be observed in several places where the units alternate upwards prior to their ingression in the domain of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation. The two formations may be seen positioned in normal stratigraphic juxtaposition, that is: the Vale do Rio do Peixe settled over Ara\u00e7atuba (SP 379, Ibir\u00e1, entrance to S\u00e3o Benedito district; highway Potirendaba - Nova Alian\u00e7a, around 3.5 km from Nova Alian\u00e7a; and at the entrance to Nova Alian\u00e7a). Less frequently they may simulate a stratigraphic inversion (SP 300, km 548.5; and highway Potirendaba-Nova Alian\u00e7a, around 5 km from Nova Alian\u00e7a). On its border zone, the Ara\u00e7atuba unit is exposed in valleys where the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation occurs in water divisors, as can be verified, for example, in the highway SP 425 between kms 314 and 325.\nIn a restricted way, swampy conditions also occurred south of the main area of the Ara\u00e7atuba deposits, in the domain of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation. Sparse and restricted exposures of grayish-green siltstones are described in the surroundings\nNE\tN40E\tsw\n\t\t\t\u2014\t.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2014\tVale do Rio do Peixe Fm.\n\t\t/\tAra\u00e7atuba Fm.\n0\t1\t2 3m\n\tdo Peixe Fm.\n\t\n\tAra\u00e7atuba Fm.\n\t\nFig. 6 - Contac between Ara^atuba and Vale do Rio do Peixe formations: evidence of the Ara^atuba paleoswamp silting by eolian dunes.

Such occurrences are regionally circumscribed by the aeolian deposits of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation, at stratigraphic and, probably, chronological positions that are slightly higher than the exposures in the Ara\u00e7atuba region.\nThe Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation is the most extensive unit of the Neocretaceous succession and is present on the entire eastern part of Bauru Basin. Along the medium valleys of the Tiet\u00ea, Aguape\u00ed and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Dourados rivers the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation surrounds and overlies the contemporary Ara\u00e7atuba Formation. The geological contact is, as a general rule, gradual and recurring, a stratigraphic aspect that is probably due to the contemporaneous nature of the Ara\u00e7atuba and Vale do\nRio do Peixe units. In the transition zone, the sandstones are usually massive, exhibit a sub-horizontal bedding and less sorting than similar rocks in the interior zone. Their colors range from brown to greenish-gray (e.g. on Highway SP 419, km 22; Nipo\u00e3-Planalto Highway, at ~ 13 km from Nipo\u00e3, Turi\u00faba-Macaubal highway, at ~ 16 km from Tu-ri\u00faba, Maced\u00f4nia-Fernand\u00f3polis road, ~ km 114 and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Iracema-General Salgado Highway, ~ km 7.5). The passage between units is sometimes abrupt and happens at intervals of a few meters, where the recurring contact can best be seen. It is probable that such structural appearance is due to oscillations of the swamp borders, a movement that ceased only after the total superposition of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation (see Figure 6). Such evolution may be seen, for example, in outcrops at highway SP 300 km 548.5 (outskirts of Ara\u00e7atuba city), highway SP 425, close to km 329; highway Potirendaba-Nova-Alian\u00e7a, about 5km from Nova Alian\u00e7a and highway SP 300, km 575). The con\ntacts exhibited by these outcrops are subhorizontal and non-erosive. The evidence suggests that the silting of the Ara\u00e7atuba swamp proceeded in a drying palustrine environment.\nPALEOCURRENTS\nThe prevailing depositional processes in the swamp, mainly in its interior, were those of decantation. Sedimentary flow structures are uncommon in the unit. At the marginal zones of the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation inclined surfaces between sandy bodies with sigmoid perfil, can eventually be observed (Figure 3c). These bodies appear to have a tendence to progress toward the interior, which is the dip azimuth of inclined bedding. They probably represent sandy marginal lobes around the Ara\u00e7atuba swamp. Although in small number, the surface attitudes tend to west-southwest directions, which might be interpreted as a record of the advance of aeolian border sandy lobes, during dry phases. It must be emphasized that this trend coincides with paleowinds that shaped small dunes and adjacent sand beds in the Vale do Rio do Peixe unit (Fernandes and Coimbra 1999).\nA comparatively large amount of mudstone intercalations have been observed in the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation, west of the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation area. It suggests a more frequent exposure of the water table on that part of the basin. It is believed that the loess deposits, represented by silty lithofacies, were possibly retained in those damper areas. On the other hand, indications of water flowing from east or south of the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation are very scarce. So, it is conceivable that the accumulated water had flowed in mainly from western or northern banks. A high frequency of wadi stream deposits would then be expected in the upper part of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation at the basin west side (Mato Grosso do Sul).\nFACIES ASSOCIATIONS AND DEPOSITIONAL SETTING\nSwamp deposits in the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation are composed of two facies associations (Table I):\nsiltstones in tabular beds (FM) and sigmoidal sandy lenses (SL). The FM association forms deposits inside the swampy area, whereas SL refers to accumulations in the border zone. The sedimentation took place in a large endorheic area of swampy, shallow and stagnant waters. In the upper part of the Ara\u00e7atuba unit an increased number of outcrops favor the exposition of vestigial small-sized vegetation, as well as saline crusts and crystal molds.\nIsolated sandy lenses (SL) appear in the border areas among poorly defined beds of siltstone. Apparent convoluted stratification can be occasionally found (SP 425, km 292.9, entrance to Pen\u00e1polis city). These features suggest deposition and sliding of border deposits in paludal areas. The process creates small deltaic lobes and aeolian dunes fluidized by phreatic level oscillations along the swamp borders. It has been verified that there is a relative increase of the fine sand fraction towards the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation periphery, where a transition zone to the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation presumably existed. This passage probably consisted of the interface swamp border-eolian sand sheets, with wadis (e.g. road cut in BR 153, km 187.8). Examples of this peculiar facies association can be observed on the road cuts of SP 300 (km 475.8), SP 300 (km 478.5), BR 153 (km 112.5), Novo Horizonte-Sales (around km 424, Urup\u00eas), and SP 379 (Ibir\u00e1, S\u00e3o Benedito District).\nIt can be concluded that the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation was erected by deposits of paludal origin, the Ara\u00e7atuba swamp, accumulated in a wide flat inner area of sandy sheets (the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation).\nIn swampy zones, the exposure of sediments to a more arid climate caused precipitation of carbonate and, eventually, sulphate (gypsum) during the drying-up of residual saline lakes (playa lakes). The present physiographic environment of the Pantanal Matogrossense could parallel the old Ara\u00e7atuba deposition scenery in as much as the surrounding border of the Pantanal is covered by sediments deposited in zones of low regional declivity (around 1m/km, Boggiani and Coimbra 1996).

The absence of preserved vegetal and animal remains strengthens that interpretation. However, Batezelli et al. (1999) advocate a lacustrine environment for the Ara\u00e7atuba deposits.\nTHE FORMER ARA\u00c7ATUBA SWAMP AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE BAURU BASIN\na) The Basin Framework\nThe filling of the Bauru Basin may have occurred in the course of slow and constant mechanical subsidence. This idea is corroborated by the lack of any significant tectonic dislocation and also by the gen\neral NNE gutter shape of the basin that coincides with the thickest basalt zones. The generating process to the main space for the sedimentation was a mechanical subsidence that followed the tectonic inherited structures imprinted in the substratum and therefore gave opportunity for the filling and evolution of the basin. Even some of the present lows on the basalt top, such as the depressed zone where the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation developed, correspond to the original relief of the substratum (Figure 7), since they perfectly fit the lithofacies limits. The depression along the west border follows a straight line in the NNE direction. This is the same structural direction associated to probable silicification events occurred in the meridional part of the basin (Fer-\nFig. 7- Map of the top of Serra Geral Formation: the Bauru Basin basement. The Ara^atuba depressed zone and its westernmost limit parallel the Jales-Andradina High direction.\nnandes et al. 1993), which is parallel to the basin\u2019s main axis and to one of the substratum crests, called the Jales-Andradina High (Fernandes 1998). The western limit of the Ara^atuba Formation follows that crest direction. The top of the basaltic lava flows remained exposed for millions of years until it was buried by the sediments carried from the basin borders. The absence of basal rudaceous deposits or significant erosional features suggests that the original basement surface was flat on account of the tabular shape of the basalt strata, and may have suffered further leveling by mechanical weathering during periods of semiarid climate. The current relief of the basalt basement displayed by structural contours is the end product of different subsidence rates and post-sedimentary tectonic movements.\nAt the time of the Bauru Basin filling, signifi\ncant tectonism and associated alkaline magmatism took place at the basin borders. The more active periods apparently coincided with the exchanging time between two sedimentation stages, the first is represented by a desertic tract system that included the initial entry and accumulation of sandy sediments on the basalt substratum. Sedimentation processes followed the setting of effective conditions of accumulation, which happened during the slow regional subsidence started in the Upper Cretaceous. The basal beds settled as monotonous sand sheets and intercalated dunes and loess deposits formed during a hot and dry climate (Figure 8). Inside this huge sand sea, a relatively depressed and damp region of endorheic characteristics, was covered by very fine sand and silt in a paludal environment (Ara^atuba Formation). Aeolian sediments of the Vale do Rio\ndo Peixe Formation were initially deposited at the same time and during the same environmental conditions but ended by silting the whole depression. This set of systems is dominantly aeolian but contains a fluvial component restricted to eventual flows generated by torrential rains (wadis), which were probably more intense on the northwest border. In the present study the wadis deposits are regarded as part of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation. The second filling stage of the basin took place in the presence of a larger amount of water still in the semi-arid climate (fluvial-aeolian system tract), present throughout the sedimentation of the Mar\u00edlia, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto and Presidente Prudente formations.\nAra\u00e7atuba Fm. depositional setting\nKEY: 1: saline crusts and crystals, 2: eolian dunes, 3: wadi, SG: Serra Geral Fm.

The increase in dryness towards the southwest, as well as\nthe very fine sand transported by SW winds, set up the conditions for the birth of the great Caiu\u00e1 Desert in the inner part of the basin (Fernandes and Coimbra 2000b).\nb) Sedimentation and Silting of the Ara\u00e7atuba Swamp\nDuring the initial stage of filling of the Bauru Basin a broad and monotonous blanket of sand associated to average-sized dunes and loess deposits gradually buried the basalt basement. Low fluvial activity was at that time restricted to floods of desert torrents (wadis).\nThe area encompassed by the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation coincides with a basement sag on the surface. The original bed rock relief promoted endorheic conditions inside the basin, where a large swampy area (Ara\u00e7atuba Swamp) was then installed in a semi-arid region. A negative water balance suggests that the water accumulated in this depressed semi-arid zone should have been derived from the humid west or northwest fluviatile areas, beyond the swamp limits. It is suggestive that a relative increase of mudstone and wadi deposits have been detected in the eastern area (Mirante do Parapanema and especially, Andradina). An approximately similar status can be visualized in the present-day Pantanal Mato-grossense. Although semi-arid conditions prevail in most of the Pantanal region, periodical floods have been recorded, fed by torrents coming from higher marginal parts where rains are more intense, mainly to the north at the Paraguay river source (Boggiani and Coimbra 1996).\nThe westernmost limit of the swamp deposits is a straight line matching the Jales-Andradina High (Figure 7), a positive structural high that must have served as the old swamp west border. It is conceivable that the building up of the swamp had its origin in the barrier set up by the structural high and consequent exposure of the phreatic level. The constant supply of aeolian sediments that initially erected dunes and border banks, would finally dry up and bury the original depressed area. The basal layers of the sedimentary succession filled the con\ncavities in the lower basement and eliminated any less expressive floor ruggedness.\nUntil the final drying up of the swampy areas, salt water bodies of growing salinity had been formed. They grew constantly bigger in spite of occasional dry periods. Molds of fiber radial gypsum crystals, root casts, vestiges of small size vegetation, mud cracks and carbonate cement were all formed in the transition epoch. Variations of the probably shallow water table should have caused alternation of saline lacustrine and aeolian environments. The earliest aeolian dunes that transgressed the swamp limits were occasionally flooded and mobilized by the rising of the water level. Small sand lobes intermingled with water-settled tabular beds were therefore formed, containing some evidence of sand dune fluidization.\nDuring the initial sedimentation phase, the Ara\u00e7atuba swamp was definitively silted by aeolian deposits of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation. This silting may have been the result of intensification of the interior dryness for purely climatic reasons and/or caused by barring of watercourses coming from the west and northwest. In the latter case, it is likely that the basement high, coincident with the rectilinear western border of the Ara\u00e7atuba Formation, corresponds to a geographic obstacle of tectonic origin that was active during the initial filling of the Bauru Basin. The pebbly lithofacies, which occurs a couple of kilometers to the west of Sete Lagoas (MS), would possibly correspond to ham-mada deposits linked to the basement high.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to FAPESP, the S\u00e3o Paulo State Research Support Foundation for financial support (FAPESP proceeding 93/4524-9) and to Prof. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Moacyr Vianna Coutinho for his critical reading and English text correction.\nRESUMO\nA Bacia Bauru (Cret\u00e1ceo Superior), acumulou uma se-q\u00fc\u00eancia sedimentar continental essencialmente arenosa.\nNuma fase inicial des\u00e9rtica, o seu substrato bas\u00e1ltico foi soterrado por extensa e mon\u00f3tona cobertura de areias e\u00f3licas com intercala\u00e7\u00f5es subordinadas de dep\u00f3sitos de loesse.
