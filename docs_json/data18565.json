Ambas foram instaladas durante o Eoceno, resultantes de um campo de \n\nesfor\u00e7os distensivo de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NW-SE. Este campo reativou zonas de cisalhamento de dire\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nNE do embasamento pr\u00e9-cambriano como falhas normais, importantes durante a instala\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o da bacia. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m in\u00fameras estruturas transversais ao eixo da bacia, de dire\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nN-S, NE-SW e NW-SE, as quais compreendem falhas e dobras que estiveram ativas durante \n\ndiferentes intervalos de tempo, embora seus papeis na evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da bacia ainda sejam pouco \n\nconhecidos. A fim de reconhecer estas estruturas em subsuperf\u00edcie na Bacia de Taubat\u00e9, cinco \n\nperfis s\u00edsmicos longitudinais ao eixo da bacia foram interpretados, demonstrando o car\u00e1ter \n\ndistinto dessas estruturas como falhas normais e inversas, que interceptam diferentes unidades \n\ns\u00edsmicas, indicando uma deforma\u00e7\u00e3o tect\u00f4nica polif\u00e1sica. A presen\u00e7a de altos estruturais \n\ntransversais, distingu\u00edveis em perfis s\u00edsmicos, ativos durante a abertura da bacia, pode estar \n\nrelacionada com anticlinais formados na capa das falhas, durante uma evolu\u00e7\u00e3o relacionada ao \n\ncrescimento das falhas principais de borda em um regime distensivo de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NW-SE. Ainda, \n\nforam descritas em afloramentos falhas sinsedimentares de componente normal, de dire\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nNW-SE e transversais \u00e0 Bacia de Resende, dispostas em um alto \u00e2ngulo com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 \n\norienta\u00e7\u00e3o ENE das falhas principais de borda. Estas estruturas foram interpretadas como falhas \n\nde al\u00edvio formadas no mesmo contexto distensivo. As rela\u00e7\u00f5es estratigr\u00e1ficas e a an\u00e1lise de \n\npaleotens\u00f5es das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de falhas indicaram que as estruturas transversais est\u00e3o \n\nrelacionadas a quatro eventos deformacionais: compress\u00e3o NE-SW, provavelmente durante o \n\nMioceno; compress\u00e3o NW-SE, durante o Pleistoceno Superior; distens\u00e3o E-W a NW-SE \n\ndurante o Holoceno; e por fim compress\u00e3o E-W relacionada ao campo de esfor\u00e7os atual. A \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o da Bacia de Santos na por\u00e7\u00e3o adjacente offshore durante o Cenozoico pode estar \n\ndiretamente relacionada \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de estruturas transversais, mudan\u00e7as de campo de estresse \n\ne a gera\u00e7\u00e3o e eventos deformacionais nas bacias continentais do tipo rift. \n\nPalavras chave: Tect\u00f4nica de bacias sedimentares, an\u00e1lise de paleotens\u00f5es, Cenozoico, \n\nSudeste do Brasil. \n\n\n\nABSTRACT \n\nMoura, T.T. Transverse structures in Taubat\u00e9 and Santos basins: nature and possible \n\ncontinuity in Santos Basin, Brazil. 2015. 23 f. MSc Dissertation. Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias, \n\nUniversidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nThe Taubat\u00e9 and Resende are NE-to-ENE-oriented Paleogene continental rift basins of \n\nthe central segment of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. Both basins were installed \n\nduring the Eocene as a result of a NW-SE-oriented extensional stress field. This stress field \n\nreactivated NE-trending shear zones of the Precambrian basement as normal faults, which \n\nplayed a major role during the basin installation and evolution. There are also numerous N-S, \n\nNE-SW and NW-SE-oriented structures transverse to the NE-trending basin axis. These \n\nstructures comprise faults and folds that were active at different time intervals, but their role in \n\nthe basin evolution is poorly understood yet. In order to recognize these structures in the \n\nsubsurface in Taubat\u00e9 Basin, five longitudinal seismic profiles were interpreted showing their \n\ndistinctive character as normal and reverse faults, which intersect different seismic units and \n\nindicate a polyphasic tectonic deformation. The presence of transverse structural highs, \n\nrecognizable in the seismic profiles, which were active during the opening of the basin, can be \n\nrelated to anticlines formed in the hangingwall during an evolution related to the growing of \n\nthe border master faults in a NW-SE-trending extensional regime. Moreover, syn-sedimentary \n\nNW-SE-oriented transverse normal faults oblique to the ENE-orientation of the border master \n\nfaults were described in outcrops in the Resende Basin. These structures are interpreted as \n\nrelease faults and thus formed in the same extensional context. Stratigraphic relationships and \n\npaleostress analysis of fault populations indicate that transverse structures are related to four \n\ndeformational events: a NE-SW-oriented compression probably during the Miocene, a NW-SE-\n\noriented compression in the Late Pleistocene to Holocene, an E-W-to-NW-SE-oriented \n\nextension in the Holocene and lastly, an E-W-oriented compression related to the present-day \n\nstress field. The evolution of the adjoining offshore Santos Basin during the Cenozoic has a \n\nnarrow correlation with the formation and evolution of Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins. The \n\nmigration of depocenters in the Santos Basin during the Cenozoic can be associated with the \n\npresence of NW-SE-oriented transverse structures, changes in the stress fields, and generation \n\nand deformation events in the continental rift basins \n\nKeywords: Tectonics of sedimentary basins, paleostress analysis, Cenozoic, \n\nSoutheastern Brazil  \n\n\n\n \n\nLISTA DE FIGURAS \n\nFigura 1 - Localiza\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea de estudo (adaptado de Marques, 1990 e \n\nAlmeida, 1976) ......................................................................................................................... 10 \n\nFigura 2 - Data\u00e7\u00e3o estratigr\u00e1fica de falhas.

INTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O \n\nO Rift Continental do Sudeste do Brasil (RCSB) \u00e9 uma depress\u00e3o alongada, paralela \u00e0 \n\ncosta atual do sudeste do Brasil. Possui cerca de 900 km de comprimento, percorrendo tr\u00eas \n\nestados: Paran\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo e Rio de Janeiro (Riccomini, 1989). A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do RCSB se iniciou \n\nno Pale\u00f3geno sobre as rochas de m\u00e9dio a baixo grau metam\u00f3rfico de idades paleo- a \n\nneoproterozoicas do Cintur\u00e3o Ribeira (definido por Hasui et al. 1975), al\u00e9m de granitoides do \n\nNeoproterozoico (v.g. Alves et al. 2013). \n\nNo Cintur\u00e3o Ribeira, a anisotropia das rochas e as zonas de fraqueza resultam do \n\nmetamorfismo que ocorreu durante a Orogenia Brasiliana. Ao final do evento Brasiliano o setor \n\ncentral deste cintur\u00e3o foi afetado por in\u00fameras falhas de componente transcorrente (Souza et \n\nal., 2009). De acordo com Campanha (2002), a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00f3s-Brasiliano est\u00e1 relacionada com \n\nos est\u00e1gios de transi\u00e7\u00e3o e reativa\u00e7\u00e3o da Plataforma Brasileira, passando por um evento \n\nmesozoico em que expressivos movimentos verticais precederam um magmatismo b\u00e1sico e \n\nalcalino, at\u00e9 o desenvolvimento do Rift Continental do Sudeste do Brasil durante o Cenozoico.  \n\nDe acordo com Riccomini et al. (2004) o RCSB pode ser dividido em tr\u00eas segmentos: \n\nocidental, central e oriental. As bacias de Taubat\u00e9 e Resende s\u00e3o depress\u00f5es tect\u00f4nicas \n\nlocalizadas entre a Serra do Mar e a Serra da Mantiqueira (Figura 1) e est\u00e3o inseridas no \n\nsegmento central do RCSB, assim como as bacias de S\u00e3o Paulo e Volta Redonda.  \n\n \n\nFigura 1 - Localiza\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea de estudo (adaptado de Marques, 1990 e Almeida, 1976) \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nA principal fase de desenvolvimento do RCSB ocorreu durante o Eoceno-Oligoceno, \n\ncom a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o sintect\u00f4nica do Grupo Taubat\u00e9, sedimentos depositados sintectonicamente \n\n(Riccomini et al., 2004). \n\nA Bacia de Taubat\u00e9 \u00e9 a maior bacia desse sistema rift, possuindo 170 km de \n\ncomprimento e 20 km de largura, com profundidade de at\u00e9 850 m, sendo reconhecidos seis \n\ndepocentros (denominados por Marques, 1990, como Parate\u00ed, Jacare\u00ed, Eug\u00eanio de Melo, \n\nQuiririm, Roseira e Lorena, de SW para NE) que s\u00e3o separados por altos estruturais associados \n\na falhas normais de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NW-SE, informa\u00e7\u00e3o essa corroborada por dados s\u00edsmicos \n\n(Marques, 1990) e dados gravim\u00e9tricos (Fernandes &amp; Chang, 2002). Dois altos estruturais na \n\nBacia de Taubat\u00e9 foram identificados por Fernandes &amp; Chang (2002) que os denominaram de \n\nAlto de Ca\u00e7apava e Alto de Pindamonhangaba. A Bacia de Resende, por sua vez, apresenta \n\ncomprimento aproximado de 50 km e largura m\u00e1xima de 8 km. \n\nRiccomini (1989) reconheceu dois sistemas de falhas transversais no RCSB, os sistemas \n\nNNW e NNE. O sistema NNE apresenta predominantemente falhas transcorrentes dextrais \n\nassociadas a estruturas em flor negativas e positivas, assim como falhas normais e inversas. \n\nEste sistema controla altos estruturais que localmente exp\u00f5em o embasamento pr\u00e9-cambriano, \n\nal\u00e9m de baixos. J\u00e1 o sistema NNW compreende principalmente falhas normais e transcorrentes \n\nsinistrais. Este sistema parece controlar o Alto Estrutural de Aruj\u00e1, que exp\u00f5e rochas do \n\nembasamento pr\u00e9-cambriano e separa as bacias de S\u00e3o Paulo e Taubat\u00e9. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, dobramentos em escala regional foram reconhecidos mediante contorno \n\nestrutural efetuado a partir de dados de furos de sondagem em uma \u00e1rea delimitada pelas \n\ncidades de Taubat\u00e9, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos e Pindamonhangaba (Riccomini, 1989). Takyia et al. \n\n(1990) investigou estas estruturas na Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Trememb\u00e9 usando krigagem geoestat\u00edstica. Os \n\nresultados indicaram a presen\u00e7a de dobras c\u00f4nicas com eixos de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NNW que s\u00e3o \n\ncorrelacion\u00e1veis \u00e0s dobras mesosc\u00f3picas identificadas em afloramentos da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nTrememb\u00e9 (Riccomini, 1989). Estas dobras s\u00e3o o resultado de uma compress\u00e3o NE-SW \n\nocorrida durante o Mioceno. Durante o Pleistoceno, as falhas de borda do rift foram reativadas, \n\nsob uma compress\u00e3o NW-SE, que produziu novas dobras nos folhelhos da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nTrememb\u00e9, criando assim um padr\u00e3o de interfer\u00eancia do tipo domo e bacia (Riccomini 1989, \n\nSilva 2007). \n\nEstruturas transversais de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NW-SE tamb\u00e9m foram identificadas na Bacia de \n\nSantos por Souza et al. (2009). Tais estruturas atuaram durante a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da Bacia de Santos \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\ne segundo o autor eram persistentes continente adentro, interceptando as bacias de Taubat\u00e9 e \n\nResende.  \n\nA Bacia de Santos compreende uma \u00e1rea de 352.000 km2, localizada defronte aos \n\nestados de Santa Catarina, Paran\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo e Rio de Janeiro, sendo formada por processos de \n\nrifteamento durante a separa\u00e7\u00e3o Afro-Americana no Mesozoico (Chang et al., 2008). O \n\nCintur\u00e3o Ribeira \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m o embasamento principal da \u00e1rea mais rasa da Bacia de Santos, cujo \n\npreenchimento sedimentar \u00e9 t\u00edpico de um contexto de margens divergentes, formados por \n\nsequ\u00eancias continentais, transicionais e marinhas, com espessuras de at\u00e9 13.000 m (Chang &amp; \n\nKowsmann, 1984).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n2. OBJETIVOS \n\nO objetivo deste trabalho \u00e9 analisar as estruturas transversais \u00e0s bacias de Taubat\u00e9 e \n\nResende, com enfoque em sua natureza, geometria, cinem\u00e1tica, rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nidade, campos de esfor\u00e7os ativos durante a sua gera\u00e7\u00e3o e deforma\u00e7\u00e3o e correla\u00e7\u00e3o regional. \n\nO controle exercido por falhas de al\u00edvio e falhas de transfer\u00eancia sobre a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncampos de \u00f3leo e g\u00e1s foi sugerido em estudos recentes (e.g. Destro et al. 2003). A identifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndesses tipos de falhas na Bacia de Santos requer investiga\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00edsmicas enquanto que estudos \n\nna por\u00e7\u00e3o onshore cont\u00edgua (bacias do RCSB) \u00e9 altamente facilitada pela possibilidade de \n\nobserva\u00e7\u00e3o direta. \n\nConsiderando este cen\u00e1rio, a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o tect\u00f4nica das bacias de Taubat\u00e9 e Resende \u00e9 \n\nrelevante para compreender a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o tect\u00f4nica da Bacia de Santos durante o Cenozoico. A \n\nidentifica\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas transversais na por\u00e7\u00e3o onshore certamente ser\u00e1 importante no estudo \n\nda estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o tect\u00f4nica da Bacia de Santos, com implica\u00e7\u00f5es para a explora\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo e g\u00e1s. \n\nPortanto, \u00e9 discutida a possibilidade de uma continuidade f\u00edsica dessas estruturas e/ou \n\na\u00e7\u00e3o dos campos de esfor\u00e7os a elas relacionados na Bacia de Santos. \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n3. MATERIAIS E M\u00c9TODOS \n\n3.1. Dados de campo \n\nConsiderando as controv\u00e9rsias relacionadas \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o das estruturas transversais nas \n\nBacias de Santos e Resende, o primeiro passo compreendeu o reconhecimento dessas estruturas \n\nna bibliografia e material cartogr\u00e1fico. \n\nAssim, foram selecionados afloramentos que eram mais favor\u00e1veis \u00e0 coleta de dados \n\nestruturais. Alguns dos afloramentos possuem um complexo cen\u00e1rio estrutural, sendo, portanto, \n\nimportante identificar as rela\u00e7\u00f5es de corte entre as falhas, assim como a rela\u00e7\u00e3o destas com os \n\ndep\u00f3sitos sedimentares, a fim de se obter uma idade relativa dessas estruturas. \n\nCom o objetivo de determinar a cronologia dos eventos de falhamentos foi utilizado o \n\nm\u00e9todo descrito por Angelier (1994), que considera a idade das rochas afetadas ou n\u00e3o por \n\nfalhas (Figura 2), a rela\u00e7\u00e3o geom\u00e9trica entre o deslocamento das falhas e a consist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica. \n\nTamb\u00e9m foi utilizada a rela\u00e7\u00e3o de corte entre estrias de movimento identificadas em superf\u00edcies \n\nde falhas, pois algumas falhas se moveram ou foram reativadas sob mais de um evento \n\ndeformacional. No entanto, esta rela\u00e7\u00e3o de corte, com as estrias mais jovens interceptando as \n\nmais novas, nem sempre \u00e9 clara, pois eventos mais antigos muitas vezes s\u00e3o mascarados ou \n\nmesmo apagados por eventos mais recentes, dificultando a reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o dos movimentos. \n\n \n\nFigura 2 - Data\u00e7\u00e3o estratigr\u00e1fica de falhas. As camadas superiores nas se\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o s\u00e3o afetadas por falhas (Angelier 1994) \n\n \n\nAl\u00e9m da coleta dos dados estruturais em campo, alguns afloramentos foram \n\nselecionados (especialmente pela sua import\u00e2ncia e qualidade de dados) para apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncomo panoramas, utilizando-se o programa GIMP 2 aliado ao script Pandora. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n3.2. Dados s\u00edsmicos e cartogr\u00e1ficos \n\nA fim de compilar todo o material cartogr\u00e1fico, assim como analisar os modelos digitais \n\nde eleva\u00e7\u00e3o, utilizou-se o programa Quantum Gis 2.6. Quatro imagens ASTER foram \n\nselecionadas a partir do ASTER GDEM (The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model) que \u00e9 \n\num produto desenvolvido e disponibilizado ao p\u00fablico (no site \n\ngdem.ersdac.jspacesystems.or.jp) pelo METI - Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry - do \n\nJap\u00e3o e pela NASA - United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration. As \n\nimagens s\u00e3o geradas a partir de dados coletados a partir de um instrumento \u00f3ptico espacial \n\nchamado ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer). O \n\np\u00f3s-intervalo \u00e9 de 30 m e a precis\u00e3o do modelo digital de terreno \u00e9 entre 7 e 14 m. \n\nOs mapas geol\u00f3gicos assim como os estruturais foram obtidos atrav\u00e9s do GEOBANK \u2013 \n\nCPRM (Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais \u2013 dispon\u00edvel em: geobank.cprm.gov.br) \n\nenquanto os mapas hidrogr\u00e1ficos foram obtidos a partir do IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de \n\nGeografia e Estat\u00edstica \u2013 dispon\u00edvel em www.ibge.gov.br). \n\nCogn\u00e9 et al. (2013) apresentou uma s\u00e9rie de perfis s\u00edsmicos 2D, de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\ndisponibilizados pela Petrobras e adquiridos na d\u00e9cada de 1980, para a regi\u00e3o da Bacia de \n\nTaubat\u00e9. Assim, foram selecionados os perfis paralelos ao eixo longitudinal da bacia, a fim de \n\nidentificar as estruturas transversais, em subsuperf\u00edcie, assim como a sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a \n\nsedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o das unidades na bacia. Esta rela\u00e7\u00e3o torna poss\u00edvel a data\u00e7\u00e3o relativa dos eventos \n\nde gera\u00e7\u00e3o (falhas sinsedimentares) e deforma\u00e7\u00e3o (falhas p\u00f3s- sedimentares) na bacia. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, os mapas de is\u00f3pacas da Bacia de Santos, obtidos a partir de Assine et al. \n\n2008, foram analisados a fim de se comparar a migra\u00e7\u00e3o dos depocentros na Bacia de Santos \n\ncom os eventos deformacionais observados nas bacias de Taubat\u00e9 e Resende. \n\n3.3. An\u00e1lise dos dados estruturais \n\nPara determina\u00e7\u00e3o das paleotens\u00f5es se escolheu utilizar o m\u00e9todo dos diedros retos, \n\nproposto por Angelier e Mechler (1977). Trata-se de um m\u00e9todo gr\u00e1fico de determina\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npaleotens\u00f5es. Tal m\u00e9todo n\u00e3o objetiva a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de um tensor m\u00e9dio de esfor\u00e7os, mas \n\npermite definir regi\u00f5es de confian\u00e7a onde se situam os principais eixos de esfor\u00e7os. Assim, para \n\ncada falha, dois diedros retos est\u00e3o em compress\u00e3o e dois em distens\u00e3o, sendo eles limitados \n\npelo plano da falha e pelo plano auxiliar. Assim, a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o do eixo de esfor\u00e7o m\u00e1ximo ?1 \n\ndeve pertencer ao diedro compressivo, enquanto a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o do eixo de esfor\u00e7o m\u00ednimo ?3 \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\npertence ao diedro distensivo. Consequentemente, onde dois ou mais movimentos de falhas \n\nocorrerem sob o mesmo regime de esfor\u00e7os, o eixo principal deve pertencer ao mesmo diedro \n\npara todos os mecanismos de falhas, de modo que \u00e1reas residuais indicam um intervalo de \n\npossibilidades para os eixos principais de esfor\u00e7os (Angelier, 1994). A Figura 3 resume as \n\nprincipais caracter\u00edsticas do m\u00e9todo dos diedros retos e do mecanismo de falhas. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigura 3 - Diedros retos e mecanismos de movimento em falhas. a) Visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o em perspectiva. b) Estereograma, \nhemisf\u00e9rio inferior. F: plano de falha; A: plano auxiliar; n: normal ao plano de falha; s: vetor de movimento; B: intersec\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos planos A e F; P: diedro compressivo; T: diedro distensivo (adaptado de Angelier 1994) \n\n \n\nEste m\u00e9todo foi aplicado com o uso do programa T-Tecto 3.0 (\u017dalohar &amp; Vrabec, 2007), \n\nque permite utilizar an\u00e1lise micropolar e cl\u00e1ssica de sistemas de falhas homog\u00eaneos e \n\nheterog\u00eaneos a partir de diferentes m\u00e9todos num\u00e9ricos, incluindo o de Gauss para a \n\ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o dos tensores, separando sistemas de falhas heterog\u00eaneos em subsistemas \n\nhomog\u00eaneos. A an\u00e1lise considera que a dire\u00e7\u00e3o do rejeito em um conjunto de falhas \n\ndiferentemente orientadas pode ser explicada por um \u00fanico tensor.  \n\nO m\u00e9todo Gauss para separa\u00e7\u00e3o de sistemas de falhas heterog\u00eaneos em subsistemas de \n\nfalhas homog\u00eaneos, descrito em \u017dalohar &amp; Vrabec (2007), \u00e9 baseado na filosofia tradicional de \n\ninvers\u00e3o de dados de rejeito em falhas (fault-slip data inversion), que envolve o conceito de \n\ntensor mais adequado (best-fit stress tensor). Primeiro, a \u201cfun\u00e7\u00e3o de compatibilidade\u201d \u00e9 definida \n\ncomo uma fun\u00e7\u00e3o gaussiana, que depende da \u201cmedida de compatibilidade\u201d, levando em \n\nconsidera\u00e7\u00e3o: (1) a diferen\u00e7a angular entre a tens\u00e3o cisalhante determinada e a dire\u00e7\u00e3o atual de \n\nmovimento no plano da falha e (2) a raz\u00e3o entre a tens\u00e3o normal e cisalhante no plano da falha, \n\ndesde que assumido que os resultados da invers\u00e3o de tens\u00e3o estejam em concord\u00e2ncia com a \n\nLei de Amonton. \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nAdicionalmente, foi utilizada a visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o mediante o emprego do m\u00e9todo multiple-\n\nslip que compreende a soma dos campos compressivos e distensivos de todas as falhas, o que \n\nconduz a campos P e T comuns. \n\nOs dados coletados em campo foram digitados em planilhas do tipo xls e foram \n\nadequados para a entrada no banco de dados do T-Tecto 3.0, empregando-se o programa \n\nTectonics FP 1.6.2. Trata-se de uma planilha do tipo xls, na qual os dados de entrada s\u00e3o aqueles \n\ncoletados em campo (atitudes do plano de falha, estrias e sentido do movimento).  \n\nCom o emprego do T-Tecto 3.0 tamb\u00e9m foi poss\u00edvel tra\u00e7ar os estereogramas estruturais \n\nutilizando-se a rede de Wulf (proje\u00e7\u00e3o de igual \u00e2ngulo), hemisf\u00e9rio inferior. \n\n  \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n5.

CONCLUS\u00d5ES \n\nO enfoque principal deste trabalho foi o estudo das estruturas transversais \u00e0s bacias de \n\nTaubat\u00e9 e Resende, principalmente sua natureza, geometria, cinem\u00e1tica, rela\u00e7\u00f5es com a \n\nsedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, idade, o campo de esfor\u00e7os ativo durante sua gera\u00e7\u00e3o e deforma\u00e7\u00e3o e correla\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nregionais. Al\u00e9m disso, a possibilidade de uma continuidade f\u00edsica dessas estruturas e/ou a a\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde campos de esfor\u00e7os relacionados a elas na Bacia de Santos foram tamb\u00e9m discutidos. As \n\nprincipais conclus\u00f5es deste trabalho s\u00e3o: \n\na) falhas transversas em perfis s\u00edsmicos apresentam altos mergulhos e possuem car\u00e1ter normal, \n\ninverso e transcorrente; todas as unidades s\u00edsmicas s\u00e3o interceptadas por falhas, incluindo \n\npacotes sedimentares mais jovens, por\u00e9m todas as falhas foram identificadas como pr\u00e9- e p\u00f3s-\n\nsedimentares; \n\nb) altos estruturais foram identificados em perfis s\u00edsmicos e alguns deles estiveram ativos \n\ndurante a instala\u00e7\u00e3o da Bacia de Taubat\u00e9; \n\nc) a exist\u00eancia de um alto estrutural ativo e a presen\u00e7a de uma unidade s\u00edsmica exclusiva em \n\numa sub-bacia estaria relacionada ao crescimento de uma falha de borda, em um regime \n\ndistensivo; \n\nd) o m\u00e9todo de invers\u00e3o e a an\u00e1lise de paleotens\u00f5es permitiu identificar estruturas transversais \n\nrelacionadas a cinco eventos tect\u00f4nicos previamente reconhecidos no segmento central do \n\nRCSB; \n\ne) estruturas transversais relacionadas ao evento inicial de distens\u00e3o NW-SE (Eoceno - \n\nOligoceno) s\u00e3o representadas por falhas normais sinsedimentares, relacionadas \u00e0s falhas \n\nprincipais e, aparentemente, n\u00e3o interceptam ou conectam falhas normais diferentes, indicando \n\num campo distensivo de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NE-SW, o que permite classifica-las como falhas de al\u00edvio; \n\nf) falhas transversais associadas ao evento de compress\u00e3o de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NE-SW e distens\u00e3o NW-\n\nSE (Mioceno) s\u00e3o em parte sinsedimentares em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Itaquaquecetuba; a \n\nespessura das camadas dobradas da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Trememb\u00e9, que \u00e9 praticamente uniforme, e um \n\npadr\u00e3o de dobramento en echelon indicam que essas dobras est\u00e3o relacionadas com uma \n\ncompress\u00e3o de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NE-SW, em regime transcorrente; \n\ng) falhas transversais relacionadas ao evento de compress\u00e3o NW-SE e distens\u00e3o NE-SW \n\n(Pleistoceno Superior \u2013 Holoceno) s\u00e3o principalmente normais, com uma dire\u00e7\u00e3o geral NW-\n\nSE, afetando linhas de seixos e col\u00favios; algumas dessas falhas possuem mergulho sub-vertical \n\ne a superposi\u00e7\u00e3o de estrias, verificada em alguns afloramentos, indica que tais falhas podem \n\nrepresentar reativa\u00e7\u00f5es de antigas falhas transversais de componente transcorrente; \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nh) o evento de distens\u00e3o E-W a NW-SE (Holoceno) gerou falhas transversais com uma dire\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ngeral N-S a NNE-WSW que interceptam a Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Pindamonhangaba bem como linhas de \n\nseixos e col\u00favios arenosos sobrepostos; \n\ni) poucas falhas transversais foram relacionadas \u00e0 compress\u00e3o de dire\u00e7\u00e3o E-W (atual campo \n\nde esfor\u00e7os), na \u00e1rea de estudo; a dire\u00e7\u00e3o vari\u00e1vel e a natureza das falhas indicam que foram \n\nprovavelmente formadas em eventos deformacionais pret\u00e9ritos e reativadas, pois mostram uma \n\nalta dispers\u00e3o na posi\u00e7\u00e3o das estrias relacionadas a este evento, sendo as falhas reativadas \n\nprovavelmente em um plano n\u00e3o ideal; \n\nj) apenas as estruturas NW-SE exerceram influ\u00eancia sobre a Bacia de Santos durante sua \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o cenozoica; cinco lineamentos com esta dire\u00e7\u00e3o foram reconhecidos nos mapas de \n\nis\u00f3pacas, com poss\u00edvel continuidade na \u00e1rea offshore, controlando os depocentros na Bacia de \n\nSantos: os lineamentos A (continuidade do Alto Estrutural de Aruj\u00e1) e B (prolonga\u00e7\u00e3o do Alto \n\nEstrutural de Queluz), durante o Paleoceno-Oligoceno; os lineamentos A, C e D durante o \n\nMioceno; e os lineamentos A e E durante o Pleistoceno Superior ao Recente; \n\nh) estas estruturas estiveram ativas predominantemente como falhas de transfer\u00eancia, dividindo \n\na Bacia de Santos em compartimentos; em particular, o lineamento A, que corresponde \u00e0 \n\nextens\u00e3o offshore de Alto Estrutural de Aruj\u00e1, parece ter tido uma persistente e polif\u00e1sica \n\natividade durante o Cenoz\u00f3ico; \n\ni) os maiores campos de \u00f3leo na Bacia de Santos est\u00e3o localizados na regi\u00e3o cont\u00edgua \u00e0s bacias \n\nde Taubat\u00e9 e Resende, grosseiramente entre os lineamentos A e B, de dire\u00e7\u00e3o NW-SE, o que \n\npoderia sugerir uma influ\u00eancia combinada dessas estruturas com outras falhas e dobras de \n\ndire\u00e7\u00e3o NW-SE nas rotas de migra\u00e7\u00e3o e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de armadilhas estruturais na Bacia de Santos. \n\n  \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n\nREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS  \n\nAlmeida F.F.M., 1976.

The Taubat\u00e9 Basin, with \n\nabout 170 km long and up to 20 km wide, and the Resende Basin, with 50 km long and up to \n\n8 km wide, were installed during the Eocene as a result of a NW-SE-oriented extensional \n\nstress field. This stress field reactivated NE-trending shear zones of the Precambrian basement \n\nas normal faults that played a major role during the basin installation and evolution. There are \n\nalso numerous N-S, NE-SW and NW-SE-oriented structures transverse to the NE-trending \n\nbasin axis. These structures comprise faults and folds that were active at different time \n\nintervals, but their role in the basin evolution is poorly understood yet. In order to recognize \n\nthese structures in the subsurface in Taubat\u00e9 Basin, five longitudinal seismic profiles were \n\ninterpreted showing their distinctive character as normal and reverse faults, which intersect \n\ndifferent seismic units and indicate a multiphase tectonic deformation. The presence of \n\ntransverse structural highs, recognizable in the seismic profiles, which were active during the \n\n\n\n \n\nopening of the basin, can be related to anticlines formed in the hangingwall during an \n\nevolution related to the growing of the border master faults in a NW-SE-trending extensional \n\nregime. Moreover, syn-sedimentary NW-SE-oriented transverse normal faults oblique to the \n\nENE-orientation of the border master faults were described in outcrops in the Resende Basin. \n\nThese structures are interpreted as release faults (in the sense of Destro, 1995 and Destro et \n\nal., 2003) and thus formed in the same extensional context. Stratigraphic relationships and \n\npaleostress analysis of fault populations indicate that transverse structures are related to four \n\ndeformational events: a NE-SW-oriented compression probably during the Miocene, a NW-\n\nSE-oriented compression in the Late Pleistocene to Holocene, an E-W-to-NW-SE-oriented \n\nextension in the Holocene and lastly, an E-W-oriented compression related to the present-day \n\nstress field. The evolution of the adjoining offshore Santos Basin during the Cenozoic has a \n\nnarrow correlation with the formation and evolution of Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins. The \n\nmigration of depocenters in the Santos Basin during the Cenozoic can be associated with the \n\npresence of NW-SE-oriented transverse structures, changes in the stress fields, and generation \n\nand deformation events in the continental rift basins. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nThe Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil (CRSB, Riccomini, 1989) is an elongate \n\nnarrow geomorphologic depression of Paleogene age, over 900 km long, that is roughly \n\nparallel to the current coastline. It developed over medium to low grade metamorphic rocks \n\nwithin the domain of the Ribeira Folded Belt (Hasui et al., 1975), of Paleo- to Neoproterozoic \n\nage, and intrusive granitoid rocks of Neoproterozoic age (v.g. Alves et al., 2013).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Research area (adapted from Marques, 1990, and Almeida, 1976). \n\nMajor rock anisotropy and weak zones of the Ribeira Belt are the result of \n\nmetamorphism, which occurred during the Brasiliano Orogeny. At the end of the Brasiliano \n\nevent, the central sector of this belt was affected by multiple strike-slip faults (Souza et al., \n\n2009). According to Campanha (2002), post-Brasiliano evolution is related to the transition \n\nand reactivation stages of the Brazilian Plataform, passing through a Mesozoic event with \n\nexpressive vertical movements followed by basic and alkaline magmatism (v.g. Riccomini, \n\n2005), up to the development of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil during the \n\nCenozoic. \n\n\n\n \n\nThe Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil may be subdivided in three segments: the \n\nWestern, the Central (hosting S\u00e3o Paulo, Taubat\u00e9, Resende and Volta Redonda basins) and \n\nthe Eastern segments (Riccomini et al., 2004). The Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins (Figure 1) are \n\ntectonic depressions located between the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira, in the \n\ncentral segment of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. \n\nThe Taubat\u00e9 Basin is the largest basin in the rift system, and is about 170 km long and \n\n20 km wide. Seismic data (Marques, 1990) corroborated by gravimetric data (Fernandes and \n\nChang, 2002) indicates that it is composed of six depocenters separated by structural highs \n\nassociated to NW-SE-oriented normal faults. The basement depth reach up to 850 m. The \n\nResende Basin also belongs to the central segment of the CRSB and it is located northeast of \n\nTaubat\u00e9 Basin. It is elongated in the ENE-WSW-direction (N75E, Ramos et al., 2006), with \n\n50 km long and up to 8 km wide, and the basin holds the same geological evolution as the \n\nTaubat\u00e9 Basin. \n\nThe main phase of development of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil occurred \n\nduring the Eocene-Oligocene, and the syn-tectonic sedimentary filling corresponds to the \n\nTaubat\u00e9 Group (Riccomini et al., 2004). \n\nAccording to Marques (1990), the structural framework of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin is defined \n\nby two major types of structures: right-lateral strike-slip faults, intersecting all sedimentary \n\nsection, longitudinally to the basin, and normal transverse faults, controlling asymmetric \n\nhorsts and grabens that delineate the six sub-basins (called from SW to NE: Parate\u00ed, Jacare\u00ed, \n\nEug\u00eanio de Melo, Quiririm, Roseira and Lorena).  \n\nFernandes and Chang (2002) identified two structural highs that were considered \n\ntransfer zones, in the sense of Gibbs (1984, 1990). These highs subdivide the basin into three \n\ncompartments, as hemigrabens, designated S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, Taubat\u00e9 and Aparecida, \n\nbeing the two structural highs denominated Ca\u00e7apava High and Pindamonhangaba High.  \n\n\n\n \n\nRiccomini (1989) recognized two systems of transverse faults in the CRSB, the NNE- \n\nand the NNW-trending systems. The NNE-trending system presents an array of dominantly \n\nright-lateral strike-slip faults with associated negative and positive flower structures, as well \n\nas normal and reverse faults. This system also controls structural highs, locally with \n\nexposition of Precambrian basement rocks, and lows. The NNW-trending system comprises \n\ndominantly normal and left-lateral strike-slip faults that prevail over reverse and right-lateral \n\nstrike-slip. This fault system seems to control the Aruj\u00e1 structural high, which exposes \n\nPrecambrian basement rocks and separates the S\u00e3o Paulo and Taubat\u00e9 basins (Riccomini, \n\n1989). \n\nFolding of regional scale was recognized from borehole data in the area bounded by the \n\ncities of Taubat\u00e9, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos and Pindamonhangaba (Riccomini, 1989). Takiya et \n\nal. (1990) investigated these structures in Trememb\u00e9 Formation using geostatistical kriging. \n\nThe results indicated the presence of NNW-trending conical folds that are correlatable to \n\nmesoscopic folds recognized in outcrops of Trememb\u00e9 Formation (Riccomini, 1989). These \n\nfolds resulted from a NE-SW-compression occurred during the Miocene. During the \n\nPleistocene, border faults from rift phase were reactivated, and the sedimentary rocks of \n\nTrememb\u00e9 Formation were folded as a result of a NW-SE-oriented compression, creating a \n\ndome and basin pattern of interference (Riccomini, 1989, Silva, 2007). \n\nTherefore, there are transverse faults in the Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins unrelated to \n\ntransfer zones, which nature and relationship with sedimentation are slight known. \n\nFurthermore, Souza et al. (2009) indicate that NW-SE-trending structures had acted during \n\nthe evolution of the Santos Basin and these structures are persistent inward the continent, \n\nintercepting the Taubat\u00e9 Basin.  \n\nThe Santos Basin has an area of 352.000 km2, facing the Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, \n\nParan\u00e1 and Santa Catarina states, Brazil. The basin was formed by rifting processes during \n\n\n\n \n\nMesozoic Afro-American separation (Chang et al., 2008). The Ribeira Belt is also the main \n\nbasement in the shallow area of the Santos Basin, which sedimentary filling is typical of a \n\ndivergent boundary, formed by continental, transitional and marine sequences, with up to \n\n13.000 m thick (Chang and Kowsmann, 1984). As a result of recent oil and gas discoveries, \n\nthe Santos Basin emerges as an auspicious exploratory frontier in Brazil. Nonetheless, its \n\nsubstantial area allied to scarcity of data and information about its geology grants it a limited \n\nknown basin status (Chang et al., 2008). \n\nThe control played by release and transfer faults on the distribution of oil and gas fields \n\nhas been suggested in recent studies (v.g. Destro et al., 2003). Identification of these types of \n\nfaults in the Santos Basin requires seismic surveys, while their study in the adjoining onshore \n\nportion is highly facilitated by the possibility of direct observation. In this scenario, the \n\ntectonic evolution of the Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins is relevant to understanding the \n\nCenozoic tectonic evolution of the Santos Basin. The identification of transverse structures in \n\nonshore portion certainly will be valuable in the study of the tectonic framework of the Santos \n\nBasin, with clear implications for oil and gas exploration. \n\nThus, this paper aims to analyze the transverse structures in the Taubat\u00e9 and Resende \n\nbasins with focus on their nature, geometry, kinematics, relationship with sedimentation, age, \n\nthe stress field active during their generation and deformation, and regional correlations.  We \n\ndiscuss the possible physical continuity of these structures and / or the action of stress fields \n\nrelated to them into the Santos Basin and the implications for the tectonic framework and \n\nevolution of this basin. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n2. REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING \n\nThe opening of South Atlantic initiated in the Early Cretaceous (v.g. Moulin et al., \n\n2010), and is well documented by the huge basaltic volcanism and associated dikes and sills \n\n(Serra Geral Formation and correlated rocks). \n\nIt is assumed that both the Santos Basin and Serra do Mar escarpments started to \n\ndevelop at the end of this magmatic phase, although the controls on the current physiography \n\nof the coastal region of southeastern Brazil are still a matter of debate. Some authors proposed \n\nthat the escarpments of the Serra do Mar result of secondary flexural bulge during the rift \n\nphase that would have persisted to the present day (Sacek et al., 2012). Fission-track data, \n\nhowever, indicates a rejuvenation of the topography by uplift during the Cenozoic (Hiruma et \n\nal., 2010; Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2011. 2012). Moreover, according to Franco-Magalh\u00e3es et al. (2014), \n\nzircon fission-track data indicates a regional uplift during Early Cretaceous followed by \n\nstrong erosion, and may reflect thermally driven tectonic activity. Yet, during the Late \n\nCretaceous there was an uplift marked by intense alkaline magmatism without evidence of \n\ntectonism. At that time, the resulting highlands of Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira \n\nmountain ranges were the main source area for Late Cretaceous sediments of the passive \n\nmargin basins (Santos and Campos basins) and the cratonic basin (Bauru Basin).  \n\nThe structures of the Brasiliano Cycle had a strong influence on the disposition of the \n\nmajor features of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. The ENE-trend of the coastal \n\nregion of southeastern Brazil is controlled by the Cambrian to Ordovician array of shear zones \n\n(Almeida, 1976). These shear zones were reactivated at the beginning of the Paleogene with a \n\npredominantly normal character, leading to syn-tectonic continental sedimentation of Taubat\u00e9 \n\nGroup (Riccomini et al., 1983, 1987, 1989; Melo et al., 1985), but the mechanisms that led to \n\nthis reactivation are still poorly understood. Several models were proposed, as gravitational \n\n\n\n \n\nsliding (Almeida, 1976; Fernandes, 1993; Zal\u00e1n and Oliveira, 2005), isostatic compensation \n\n(Asmus and Ferrari, 1978) and thermomechanical tilting (Riccomini, 1989). \n\nThe origin of the CRSB was previously related to a transtensional regime, a model \n\nbased on the interpretation of left-lateral movements along border faults, as in Zal\u00e1n (1986), \n\nSadowski and Dias Neto (1981), Padilha et al. (1991) as well in recent works as Cobbold et \n\nal. (2001) and Cogn\u00e9 and et al. (2013). According to Cobbold et al. (2001) the Serra do Mar \n\nwas exhumed once more in the Maastrichtian-Eocene (70-50 Ma). Between the Paleocene and \n\nOligocene (70-30 Ma), continental sediments were deposited in pull-apart basins in a right-\n\nlateral transtensional regime, based on faults in Taubat\u00e9 Basin that had northeast strikes, while \n\nstriations had northerly pitches of 10\u00b0- 40\u00b0, indicating components of right-lateral slip, \n\nespecially in syn-sedimentary faults. \n\nFerrari (2001) highlighted some important differences between extensional basins and \n\nbasins along strike-slip faults. According to Christie-Blick &amp; Biddle (1985), basins along \n\nstrike slip faults are distinct for some aspect of stratigraphic records that include: a tendency \n\nfor longitudinal and lateral basin asymmetry, owing to the migration of the depocenters \n\nthrough time; evidence for episodic rapid subsidence, recorded by thick stratigraphic sections; \n\nand the occurrence of abrupt lateral facies changes and local unconformities. These \n\ncharacteristics were not found in the basins of the central segment of the CRSB. Thus the \n\nmodel of an initial NNW-SSE-oriented extension is accepted among several authors \n\n(Riccomini, 1989; Fernandes, 1993; Salvador, 1994; Ferrari, 2001; Riccomini et al., 2004; \n\nZal\u00e1n and Oliveira, 2005). This initial extensional phase is well documented by the normal \n\ncharacter of the active master faults in the central segment of CRSB, as well as by data from \n\nstriations and the continuity observed on proximal alluvial fan deposits and source areas \n\n(Riccomini et al., 2004).  \n\n\n\n \n\nThe syn-tectonic deposition in the Central segment of the Continental Rift of \n\nSoutheastern Brazil, including the Taubat\u00e9 and Resend basins, is encompassed in the Taubat\u00e9 \n\nGroup (Riccomini et al., 2004). The syn-rift deposition is represented by the Eocene to \n\nOligocene Resende Formation, basal and lateral unit of the Taubat\u00e9 Group comprising \n\ndiamictite, polymictic conglomerate and massive mudstone with carbonate paleosoils of \n\nalluvial fan systems. Massive mudstone is laterally interbedded with cross-bedded sandstone \n\nof alluvial plains of braided rivers in the inner parts of the basins. Ankaramite lava-flows of \n\nEocene age occur in the Casa de Pedra Graben (Volta Redonda Basin), intercalated in alluvial \n\nmudstone. In the central part of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin there are claystone, organic-rich shale \n\n(locally oil-shale), and minor layers of dolomite related to a lacustrine environment of \n\nOligocene age, named as Trememb\u00e9 Formation, which also comprises sandstone at the \n\nborders of the paleolake. The uppermost part of the syn-rift sequence is mainly composed of \n\nsandstone, claystone and minor conglomerates of a fluvial meandering system of the S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo Formation. \n\nThe deformation phases involved reactivations along previous faults and subordinately \n\nthe formation of new ones (Riccomini, 1989; Salvador and Riccomini, 1995; Riccomini et al., \n\n2004). During the Neogene (Miocene) the central segment of the CRSB was under the action \n\nof a strike-slip regime, with NW-SE-oriented extension and local NE-SW-oriented \n\ncompression. This event changed the rift architecture, generating local uplifts and non-\n\ncylindrical folds, as observed in lacustrine deposits of Trememb\u00e9 Formation (Riccomini, \n\n1989; Takiya et al., 1990; Silva, 2007). The original rift depression was segmented by \n\ntransverse NNW-SSE-oriented faults that generated structural highs related to transpression. \n\nBesides, these structures acted disconnecting the Taubat\u00e9 Basin from S\u00e3o Paulo Basin, and \n\nreversed the course of the Para\u00edba do Sul River, from southwest to northeast, as a result of a \n\nheadwater capture of the Tiet\u00ea River (Riccomini et al., 2010). Sandstone and conglomerate of \n\na fluvial braided system (Itaquaquecetuba Formation) were deposited in pull-apart basins \n\n\n\n \n\ndeveloped over the structural high separating the S\u00e3o Paulo and Taubat\u00e9 basins. The base \n\nlevel changed and restructured the Paraiba do Sul River drainage, especially in the central part \n\nof Taubat\u00e9 Basin, resulting in erosion of Oligocene deposits, and the installation of a fluvial \n\nmeandering system (Pindamonhangaba Formation), comprising conglomerate, sandstone, \n\nsiltstone and claystone. After de sedimentation of Pindamonhangaba Formation there was a \n\ntectonic quiescence, with a deposition of colluvial and alluvial sediments, which are the result \n\nof relief remodeling caused by climate changes during the Quaternary (Riccomini, 1989).  \n\nWidespread Quaternary neotectonic features along the CRSB are related to a NW-SE-\n\noriented Late Pleistocene-Holocene compressive stress regime followed, successively, by an \n\nE-W- to NW-SE-oriented Holocene extension and an E-W-oriented compression (Riccomini \n\net al., 2004). These deformations are clearly evidenced by stone-lines (Ab\u2019S\u00e1ber, 1962) that \n\nare often intercepted by faults, indicating a recent tectonic activity (Riccomini et al., 1989). \n\nDuring the NW-SE-compression, which occurred during the late Pleistocene to \n\nHolocene, the rift border faults were reactivated as strike-slip faults and reverse faults, whilst \n\nthe activity of NNE-oriented faults generated structural highs, as Ca\u00e7apava and Resende, \n\nseparating the Paleogene sedimentary record into isolated basins. These faults intersect the \n\nfluvial deposits of the Pindamonhangaba Formation in the central part of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin, \n\nas well as the stone-lines (Riccomini et al., 1989; 2004). \n\nFrom the early Holocene an E-W- to NW-ESE-oriented extension took place and it \n\napparently shaped the sediment framework we know presently. It appears to be responsible \n\nfor creating N-S-oriented valleys controlled by normal faults that intersects colluvial, alluvial \n\nand stone-line deposits aged from Late Pleistocene to Holocene (Salvador and Riccomini, \n\n1995; Riccomini et al. 1989, 2004). \n\nThe last event, with an E-W-compressive character, occurred during the Holocene and \n\nis responsible for the reactivation of N-S-oriented faults as reverse faults, and created a \n\n\n\n \n\nwidespread family of conjugate hybrid and shear joints in colluvial, alluvial and stone-line \n\ndeposits (Salvador and Riccomini, 1995; Riccomini et al., 2004). This is the current stress \n\nregime in the region, as indicated by focal mechanism of earthquakes (Assump\u00e7\u00e3o, 1992, \n\n1998; Lima et al., 1997). \n\nThe stratigraphy and the evolution of stress fields in the central segment of the CRSB \n\nare summarized in Figure 2. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Litho-chronostratigraphic column and tectonic setting of CRSB (modified from Riccomini et al., 2004; Silva and Mello, 2011; and Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2013). ca: \ncolluvial-alluvial deposits; a: alluvial deposits; c: colluvial deposits; t: talus deposits. 1.

Macedo (1989) pointed a correlation between the deformation of Santos Basin with \n\ntectonic pulses in the onshore continental area of southeastern Brazil, as indicated by turbidite \n\ndeposits in Santos Basin. According to Meisling et al. (2001), the margin of southeastern \n\nBrazil was reactivated in three main phases that were related to three phases of Andean \n\norogeny by Cobbold et al. (2001).  \n\nThe first one occurred in the Late Cretaceous with exhumation of Serra do Mar, the \n\nsecond in the Paleogene, with further exhumation of Serra do Mar, alkaline magmatism and \n\nformation of Paleogene basins, as the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. The last one occurred during the \n\nNeogene, when Paleogene basins were inverted, and the supply of clastic sediments was \n\ndiverted from Santos Basin to Campos Basin, and with the development of an anticline in \n\nCabo Frio. \n\nChang et al. (2008) summarized the evolution of Santos Basin into a rift phase and a \n\npassive margin phase. During the development of the syn-rift phase, the stress was confined, \n\ncreating crustal faults. The later phase developed with the lithospheric crust thinning partly, \n\nwhich generated the formation of faults with lower dip. In a third phase, a sag basin was \n\nformed, with the deposition of the main source rock of Santos Basin. From this phase on, it \n\noccurred an expressive evaporitic sedimentation, during the Aptian. After the evaporitic phase \n\nit was installed a clastic deposition in the proximal region and a carbonate sedimentation, in \n\nthe deep area. During the passive margin phase, in the Albian, the continents were separated \n\nand a significant subsidence has occurred, allowing the sea incursion and the development of \n\na carbonate platform. According to Macedo (1989), this thermal subsidence caused a tilting of \n\nthe tectonic blocks. Alluvial and fan delta deposits in proximal areas of this platform indicate \n\ntectonic movements in the continental area, maybe related to a new uplift of Serra do Mar. \n\n\n\n \n\nThe carbonate platform extinction occurred in the Cenomanian, and this carbonate section \n\nwas already deformed by halokinesis. Two transgressive sequences drowned the carbonate \n\nplatform, one of that responsible for the deposition of the main source rock of post-rift phase, \n\nwhich is related to second anoxic event of the Cretaceous. During the Late Cretaceous, three \n\nphases of progradation caused the coastline retreat. These sedimentary pulses might be related \n\nto tectonic movements in the continent, as the uplift of Serra do Mar. Also, this period is \n\ncorrelated with the alkaline magmatism in the region. An extensional regime is suggested by \n\nthe register of basic volcanism in Santos and Campos basins during the Eocene, which may be \n\nrelated to the initial extensional phase that originated the CRSB (Macedo, 1989). In the top of \n\nthe Cenomanian sequence in the Santos Basin is recorded a regional unconformity, over \n\nwhich two progradational sequences were deposited. According to Chang et al. (2008), the \n\nCenozoic section of Santos Basin records two unconformities, one in the Oligocene and other \n\nin the Miocene. Yet, in the Eocene it was installed a lowstand system tract, allowing the \n\nformation of a big turbidite reservoir (Figure 3). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Stratigraphic chart of Santos Basin (modified from Pereira et al., 1986 and Assine et al,. 2008, \navailable in ANP - Ag\u00eancia Nacional do Petr\u00f3leo: www.anp.gov.br; geological scale actualized according to \nCohen et al., 2013) \n\n\n\n \n\nAssine et al. (2008) performed a sequence stratigraphic analysis using seismic lines and \n\nwell data to demonstrate that depocenters in Santos Basin have migrated northeastwards \n\nduring the Late Cretaceous into the Campos Basin, where the Tertiary section is well \n\ndeveloped. It was evidenced that a Paleogene section is well developed in the north portion of \n\nthe Santos Basin, and another important Paleogene and Neogene depocenter was in the \n\nsouthern portion of this basin. These depocenters were considered in terms of their relevance \n\nto understand the relation between the formation of reservoir rocks and the timing of \n\npetroleum generation and migration. The presence of transverse structures in the Santos \n\nBasin, related to different stress regimes during the Cenozoic, certainly represents a new \n\nelement to be considered in the exploratory models for hydrocarbons. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n3. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n3.1. Field data \n\nConsidering the controversies regarding the formation of transverse structures in \n\nTaubat\u00e9 and Resende basins, the first step comprised the recognition of these structures in the \n\nprevious papers and cartographic materials, selecting some of them as the most favorable to \n\ncollect structural data in outcrops. Some of the available outcrops have a complex structural \n\nsetting, being important to identify cross-cutting relationships between faults as well as the \n\nsedimentary deposits in order to have a relative age of these structures.  \n\nWith the purpose of determining the chronology of faulting it was used the method \n\ndescribed by Angelier (1994), which considers the age of the rock formations affected or \n\nunaffected by faults, the geometrical relationship between fault motions and the mechanical \n\nconsistency. It was also used the cross-cutting relationship between identified slickensides \n\n(motion striae), because some faults were reactivated under more than one deformation event. \n\nAnother way to describe the chronology of different events is the observation of the cross-\n\ncutting relationship between striae, the younger cutting the older. However, it is not easy to \n\nobserve due to the fact that older events might be usually masked or even erased by younger \n\nevents, hampering the reconstruction of the movements. \n\nBesides the collection of structural data during field survey, some outcrops were \n\nselected (especially because of their importance and data quality) for presentation as \n\npanoramas using the software GIMP 2 and Pandora script.  \n\n3.2. Cartographic and seismic data \n\nIn order to gather all the cartographic material as well as to analyze the digital elevation \n\nmodels, it was used the software Quantum GIS 2.6.1. Four ASTER images were selected, \n\n\n\n \n\nfrom The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), which is a joint product \n\ndeveloped and made available to the public by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry \n\n(METI) of Japan and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n\n(NASA).  It is generated from data collected from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal \n\nEmission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), a spaceborne earth observing optical \n\ninstrument. The post interval is 30 m and the digital elevation model accuracy is between 7 \n\nand 14 m. The hydrography was obtained from Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica \n\n(IBGE, in www.ibge.gov.br) while the structural and geological maps were obtained from \n\nGEOBANK, from CPRM, Brazil Geological Survey, in geobank.cprm.gov.br. \n\nThe seismic profiles were obtained from Cogn\u00e9 et al. (2013). Only seismic profiles \n\nparallel to the Taubat\u00e9 basin axis were selected, as they supposedly can provide the better \n\nview of transverse structures. \n\nFurthermore, the isopach maps of Santos Basin were obtained from Assine et al. (2008), \n\nin order to compare the depocenter migration in the Santos Basin with the deformation events \n\nobserved in the Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins.  \n\n3.3. Structural data analysis \n\nThe right dihedra method of fault analysis, proposed by Angelier &amp; Mechler (1977), \n\nwas employed to determine the paleostress fields. It is a graphical method that allows defining \n\na reliable region where are the main stress axes from fault-slip data. Combining constrains \n\nfrom several faults related to each other allows the definition of ?1?and??3 orientation fields \n\nthat are compatible with different percentages of the faults (Orife and Lisle, 2006). The \n\norientation of the ?1 axis must belong to the compressional dihedron, whereas the orientation \n\nof the ?3 axis belongs to extensional dihedron. Consequently, where two or more fault slips \n\n\n\n \n\nhave occurred in the same stress regime, the main axes must belong to the corresponding \n\ndihedron for all the faults mechanism (Angelier, 1994). \n\nIf the slips on a set of faults all result from a single stress tensor, the stereogram should \n\ndisplay ?1 and ?3 orientations regions compatible with 100% of faults (Orife and Lisle, 2006). \n\nIn other words, in projection, all areas, which are not homogenous in terms of compressional \n\nand extensional dihedron, are progressively erased. As a result, the residual areas indicate the \n\nrange of possibilities for the main stress axes (Angelier, 1994). Figure 4 summarizes the \n\ncharacteristics of right dihedral and the fault slip mechanism.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Right dihedra and the fault slip mechanism. a) Perspective view. b) Stereogram, lower hemisphere. F:  \nfault plane; A: auxiliary plane; n: normal to fault plane; s: unit slip vector in (a), reverse right-lateral slickenside \nlineation in (b); B: intersection of planes A and F; P: compressional dihedron; T: extensional dihedron (adapted \nfrom Angelier, 1994). \n\nThis method was applied making use of the software T-Tecto 3.0 (\u017dalohar and Vrabec, \n\n2007) that enables classical and micropolar analysis of heterogeneous and homogeneous fault \n\nslip data using several different numerical method, including the Gauss method. It is based on \n\nthe classical philosophy of fault-slip data inversion that consists of determining the stress \n\ntensor knowing the direction and the sense of slip on numerous faults of various orientations \n\n(Angelier, 1994). The Gauss method separates heterogeneous fault system in homogenous \n\nfault subsystem, and it was described by \u017dalohar and Vrabec (2007). The optimal solution for \n\n\n\n \n\nstress tensors that activated the observed faults is found by searching for the global and \n\nhighest local maxima of the object function defined as a sum of compatibility functions for all \n\nslip-data.  \n\nAdditionally it was used a Multiple-slip method visualization that is the sum of the \n\ncompressional and extensional field for all faults, which leads to the common P and T fields. \n\nThe structural data collected was processed through the worksheet Tectonics FP 1.6.1 in \n\norder to adequate the information from faults and slickenside striae (strike \n\ndip/dip//trend/plunge and movement sense) besides the reliability height to T-Tecto 3.0 entry.  \n\nMoreover the structural stereograms were traced by T-Tecto 3.0, using the Wulf net \n\n(equal angle projections), lower hemisphere. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n4. DATA AND INTERPRETATION \n\n4.1. Seismic data \n\nThe 178 km of 2D seismic profiles were acquired for PETROBRAS in the 1980\u2019s and \n\nwere presented previously in Marques (1990), Carvalho et al. (2011) and Cogn\u00e9 et al. (2013). \n\nThe earlier interpretation was done by Marques (1990), nonetheless the image resolution was \n\npoor. In Cogn\u00e9 et al. (2013) high-resolution images were presented, allowing the \n\ninterpretations presented in this paper. \n\nThe location of interpreted longitudinal seismic profiles is presented in Figure 5. \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Location of seismic lines over geological map (modified from Marques, 1990 and Perrota et al., 2005) \n\nMarques (1990) identified four seismic units, comprising the basement, seismic unit A, \n\nseismic unit B and Taubat\u00e9 Group. Cogn\u00e9 et al. (2013) divided the Taubat\u00e9 Group into \n\nResende and Trememb\u00e9 formations. In this paper it has been adopted the stratigraphic \n\nsuccession from Marques (1990) and Cogn\u00e9 et al. (2013).  \n\n\n\n \n\nThe seismic lines were overlaid on geological map (Perrota et al., 2005) in order to \n\nguide the location in surface of Resende and Trememb\u00e9 contacts. The top of Taubat\u00e9 Group, \n\ncorresponding to a regional unconformity overlain by the Pindamonhangaba Formation, was \n\nnot considered by the reason that its thickness is less than 30 m, which makes this unit not \n\ndistinguishable on seismic profile due to scale proportions. The same occurs with colluvial \n\nand alluvial covers. Marques (1990) attributed a Late Cretaceous age for seismic units A and \n\nB and they are not exposed or drilled by wells. Nevertheless, research based on apatite and \n\nzircon-fission track indicates a post-rift period of exhumation during Late Cretaceous to Early \n\nPaleocene and the area where the central segment of the Continental Rift of Southeastern \n\nBrazil were installed was uplifted (Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2013). Furthermore, the first stages of \n\ndevelopment of the CRSB are from the Paleocene, which is recorded on the travertines of S\u00e3o \n\nJos\u00e9 de Itabora\u00ed Basin (Ricomini et al., 2004). Hence, it is possible to assume a Paleogene (up \n\nto Early Eocene) age to the units A and B in the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. \n\nIn order to identify the different seismic units the following criteria were used: \n\n? basement reflector unit: it is defined as the deepest strong and continuous reflector; the \n\nseismic energy returned weak below this surface except for the multiples reflections - \n\nmultiply reflected seismic energy, or any event in seismic data that has incurred more \n\nthe one reflection in its travel path (Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary, 1998) \u2013 that \n\noccurs in some profiles with major significance; and the shape of the surface of \n\nbasement that may be related to a paleorelief;  \n\n? reflector Unit A: it is identified by a strong reflector at the top and non-structured \n\nreflectors below; according to Marques (1990), Unit A is a basal unit, laid directly \n\nover the basement, which is not exposed, and is considered as coarse clastic \n\nsediments; \n\n\n\n \n\n? reflector Unit B: it is described as a strong reflector at the top and with some \n\nstructuration below it and the reflectors below are thinly layered; according to \n\nMarques (1990), the Unit B is discordantly laid over Unit A, and it is composed of \n\nrhythmic mudstone at the base grading to sandy sediments at the top; \n\n? Resende Formation: it is formed by strong and parallel reflectors that are sometimes \n\ndeformed by faults; \n\n? Trememb\u00e9 Formation: it grades laterally, so it was identified using the geological \n\nmap; at the base a strong reflector was used to mark the transition between Resende \n\nand Trememb\u00e9 formations. \n\nMarques (1990) identified some flower structures that indicates strike-slip faults. Cogn\u00e9 \n\net al. (2013) did not found these structures in high-resolution seismic lines, assigned them as \n\nnormal and reverse faults, as in this paper. \n\nSeismic profile 225-0061 \n\nThe segment covered by this line (Figure 6) was denominated by Marques (1990) as \n\nEug\u00eanio de Melo Sub-basin, and it is delimitated by two structural highs. The structural high \n\nto the west was called Ca\u00e7apava High, where basement crops out in the central part of the \n\nbasin (Marques, 1990).\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Seismic profile 225-0061 (modified from Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2013) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the geological map, it is possible to observe that there are two major structures with \n\nNW-trending direction, which intercept the profile and are located in the structural highs. \n\nThese structural highs are faulted in seismic profile. The basement depth is approximately 300 \n\nms TWT, but in the structural highs it is shallower, reaching no more than 8 ms TWT. \n\nMoreover, it is deformed by pre- and post-sedimentary faults, and presents reverse and normal \n\nfaults. Features like folds in the basement are also present, as previously recognized by Cogn\u00e9 \n\net al. (2013).  \n\nLaying over the basement in an erosional contact is the Unit B. In this profile was not \n\npossible to recognize the Unit A.  \n\nThe upper reflector unit is the Taubat\u00e9 Group, formed by the Resende and Trememb\u00e9 \n\nformations. The contact between these two units is lateral and was traced based on geological \n\nmap. In the seismic profile it was not possible to recognize any syn-sedimentary fault. All \n\nfaults are post sedimentary and present normal character. \n\nSeismic profile 225-0059 \n\nThe segment of Figure 7 was denominated as Quiririm Sub-basin by Marques (1990). \n\nAccording to geological map, the unit exposed at the surface is the Trememb\u00e9 Formation. The \n\nbasement overtakes 500 ms TWT deep in some areas, and it is highly deformed by normal \n\nand reverse faults. In this profile, the Unit B rests directly over the basement and there is no \n\nregister of Unit A. The sedimentary pack formed by Unit B, Resende and Trememb\u00e9 \n\nformations is intersected by faults, especially at SW. These structures are very steep and \n\npresent normal character. The thickness of sedimentary units seems to decrease to NE while \n\nthe basement becomes shallower. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Seismic profile 225-0059 (modified from Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2013) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSeismic profile 225-0064 \n\nIn Marques (1990) this profile comprises the Capela do Socorro High (Figure 8), later \n\ndenominated as Pindamonhangaba high by Fernandes (1993), separating the Quiririm and \n\nRoseira sub-basins. According to Riccomini. (2004), this high corresponds to an anticline \n\ntrending NW-SE.  \n\nEvaluating the sedimentary succession, there is no Unit A, and the Unit B is \n\nimmediately laid over the basement, with depth up to 300 ms TWT. The Unit B and the \n\nResende Formation are thinner over the structural high when compared to the adjoining areas. \n\nThe superficial unit in the geological map is the Pindamonhangaba Formation. Nevertheless, \n\nit is not visible in the seismic scale, thus it was represented the formation bellow with \n\nthickness consistent with the seismic scale. \n\nAccording to geological map, there is a NNE-oriented fault that intercepts this profile \n\nbetween 300 and 400 and might be associated to the fault set located at 350. This fault \n\npresents a clear variation in thickness of Unit B and Resende Formation, the former thicker to \n\nthe west and the latter thicker to the east, which suggests a strike-slip movement. Most faults \n\nthat are deforming the sedimentary pack are normal in the vertical section, although there are \n\nsome faults with reverse components. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Seismic profile 225-0064 (modified from Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2013) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSeismic profiles 225-0065 and 225-0063 \n\nThe area crossed by these two profiles corresponds to the Roseira Sub-basin (Marques, \n\n1990), and there is some overlap between the two profiles (for location see Figure 5). All the \n\nseismic units are present in these profiles, and this is the only sub-basin that includes the Unit \n\nA, the oldest in the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. In the seismic profile 225-0065 (Figura 10), the \n\nsedimentary pack is very deformed. Most faults are intercepting all units, including the \n\nbasement, which depth is up to 700 ms TWT. In these segments it is possible to observe the \n\nmajor depth registered in the studied sections in the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. \n\nThe structures are very steep, and dip at times to SW and so to NE, and can be normal \n\nor reverse. In the geological map, a major NNW-oriented fault intercepts this profile at 600 \n\nand it may be related to the fault set between 600 and 700. Another major fault is identified in \n\nthe geological map, but it not intercepts the profile. It is a NNE-oriented fault that may be \n\ncovered by Quaternary sediments, so it is possible that it intercepts the profile. A fault set at \n\n400 could be related to this NNE-oriented fault. Most faults apparently end before \n\nintercepting the Trememb\u00e9 Formation probably due to the surface interference and \n\nconsequently inadequate information on the first meters of these profiles.  \n\nThe seismic profile 225-0063 (Figure 9) presents the basement highly deformed \n\nalthough the sedimentary pack is intercepted by a few faults. A major NNW-oriented fault can \n\nbe identified in the geological map and intercepts the profile 225-0063 at around 400. There \n\nare some fault sets between 350 and 450 that may be related to this fault. All units are \n\nidentifiable, and it is possible to observe a sedimentary thickening from W to E. Unlike the \n\nprofile 225-0065 the faults described in this profile do not intercept all units, being restricted \n\nto certain units.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Seismic profile 225-0063 (modified from Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2013) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Seismic profile 225-0065 (modified from Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2013) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.  Structural data \n\nBased on previous data and filed work, 17 outcrops with transverse faults were selected \n\nfor structural analysis (see location in Figure 11). Of these, 11 are in the Taubat\u00e9 Basin, with a \n\nmajor concentration near the Ca\u00e7apava Structural High, three in the region of separation \n\nbetween the S\u00e3o Paulo and Taubat\u00e9 basins, three in the Resende Basin and one in the latest \n\nCretaceous Itatiaia alkaline massif (northwest of Resende Basin). \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Location map of selected sites for structural analysis. In the stereograms: blue line - normal faults; \nbrown line - reverse faults; green line \u2013 strike-slip faults; arrow \u2013striae (geological and structural map from \nGEOBANK; adapted from Perrota et al., 2005 and Leite et al., 2004) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFault-slip data inversion and paleostress determination using the software T-Tecto 3.0, \n\nand relationship between faults and sediments, allowed to identify five tectonic events as \n\ndescribed below. \n\nNW-SE-oriented extension (Eocene - Oligocene) \n\nThe NW-SE-oriented extensional event is related to the rift opening during the Eocene - \n\nOligocene. According to Riccomini (1989), this phase is correlated to the sedimentary filling \n\nof Taubat\u00e9 Group (formed by Resende, Trememb\u00e9 and S\u00e3o Paulo formations), and is well \n\ndocumented mainly in ENE to E-W-trending border faults, which follow the structural \n\ndirection of ancient shear zones of Precambrian basement. This fault system is widespread in \n\nthe central segment of CRSB. \n\nAn outcrop previously studied by Cassini (2011), at the NE boundary of Resende Basin, \n\nsite T-13 (Figures 12 and 13), presents E-W to NW-SE-oriented syn-sedimentary normal \n\nfaults transverse to the Resende Basin axis. Some of these faults are low-angle normal faults. \n\nIndividual throw ranges from a few centimeters up to some decimeters. There is a NNW-SSE-\n\noriented oblique strike-slip with a vertical displacement of about 1m.  \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Outcrop of site T-13. Most of faults are normal and syn-sedimentary. The rocks of Resende \nFormation are folded and intercepted by an oblique strike-slip fault, related to a later deformational event. \n\nThe mudstone, conglomerate and sandstone of Resende Formation are deformed by \n\nfaults and folds. Clay injection were observed along some normal faults. All the normal faults \n\nwere considered syn-sedimentary, as the faults do not crosses the upper layers (Figure 13).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Site T-13: detail of a low-angle normal fault (hammer as scale) \n\nThe oblique strike-slip fault and the folds were interpreted as a later deformation, due to \n\nfact that either affect all the sedimentary succession. This section corresponds to the upper \n\npart of the Taubat\u00e9 Group as nearby the deposits of the Resende Formation are laterally \n\ninterfingered with those of the S\u00e3o Paulo Formation.  \n\nPaleostress analysis of the population of normal faults indicates an extensional field \n\ntrending NE-SW, with a vertical compressional field (Figure 14a).  \n\nAt site T-12, in the north border of Taubat\u00e9 Basin (Figures 11 and 14b), one NNE-\n\nSSW-oriented normal fault with a left-lateral strike-slip component was measured. The fault \n\ndips to SE, intercepts deposits of the Resende Formation and marks the tectonic contact \n\nbetween conglomerate of alluvial fan to the northwesthwest and and fluvial mudstone and \n\nsandstone to the southeast. The minimum throw is over 7 m and the fault presents a syn-\n\nsedimentary character as the sedimentary layers grow in thickness toward the footwall. This \n\ntransverse fault is oblique to the NE-oriented master faults at this part of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 \u2013 NE-SW extensional field related to release faults. In: a) T-13; b) T-12. Blue is the extensional field \nwhile red is the compressional field \n\n \n\nNE-SW-oriented compression and NW-SE-oriented extension (Miocene) \n\nThe stress regime with NE-SW-oriented compression and NW-SE-oriented extension is \n\nrelated to the first deformational event in the CRSB. It corresponds to the event of left-lateral \n\ntranscurrence proposed by Riccomini (1989). Two outcrops presented transverse faults \n\nassociated to this deformational event, T-05 and T-09 (Figure 15). \n\nThe fault data of site T-05 were obtained entirely within the domain of the Late \n\nCretaceous Itatiaia alkaline massif, northwest of the Resende Basin. This massif is mainly \n\ncomposed of nepheline syenite (Riccomini et al., 2005) and surrounded by Precambrian \n\nmetamorphic rocks of Ribeira Belt. The continuity of these fault zones into the Resende Basin \n\nindicates that it is younger than the Eocene-Oligocene Resende Formation (Riccomini et al., \n\n2004). A total of 25 faults were measured, most of them strike-slip, with two main directions, \n\nWNW-ESE and NNE-SSW, both subvertical. Among the NNE-SSW-oriented faults, three are \n\nreverse faults and three strike-slip. The WNW-ESE-oriented population of faults comprises \n\nmainly strike-slip faults. \n\na b \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPaleostress analysis of this fault population indicates a NW-SE-oriented extensional \n\nfield and a NE-SW-compressional field, in a transcurrent regime (Figure 15 a). According to \n\nRiccomini (1989), the WNW-ESE- and NNE-SSW-oriented structures acted as synthetic and \n\nantithetic strike-slip faults, respectively. \n\nAt site T-09, a sandy quarry in Itaquaquecetuba, next to the Aruj\u00e1 Structural High, NE-\n\nSW- to WNW-ESE-oriented predominantly normal faults and subordinately left-lateral strike-\n\nslip faults with normal components affect sandstone and conglomerate of the Miocene \n\nItaquaquecetuba Formation. Some of these faults area clearly syn-sedimentary with individual \n\nthrow of up to 4 m. Paleostress analysis of this fault population indicates a NW-SE-oriented \n\nextensional field (Figure 15 b). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 \u2013NE-SW-oriented compressional paleostress field obtained from fault population of site T-05 (a) and \nT-09 (b). Blue and red are the extensional and the compressional fields, respectively. \n\n \n\nNW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented extension (Late Pleistocene \u2013 Holocene) \n\nThe stress regime comprising NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented \n\nextension corresponds to the second deformational event in the CRSB, or the event of right-\n\nlateral transcurrence proposed by Riccomini (1989). Transverse faults related to this event \n\nwere studied at sites T-01, T-03 and T-06 (Figure 11). \n\na b \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSite T-01 is a large road cut along the Carvalho Pinto highway, nearby the Ca\u00e7apava \n\nHigh, in the central part of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. Fault population of this site includes \n\npredominantly NW-SE-oriented normal faults, with variations to N-S and WNW-ESE, with \n\nmedium to high dips (up to subvertical) predominantly to NE and E. These faults truncate \n\nmudstones of the Resende Formation and, in two cases, sandy clayey colluvium of \n\nQuaternary age. Individual measured throw ranges from decimeters to more than 6 m (Figure \n\n16). One NW-SE-trending subvertical fault shows two striae, the older suggesting a right-\n\nlateral strike-slip and the younger a normal movement. Paleostress determination (Figure 17a) \n\nindicates a clear NE-SW-oriented extension.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16 \u2013 Site T-01, road cut along the Carvalho Pinto Highway, located near Ca\u00e7apava Velha. The outcrop is \n80 m long approximately \n\nSite T-06 is located at the southwestern part of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin in an isolated \n\noccurrence of sedimentary rocks of the S\u00e3o Paulo Formation near to a reverse fault in the \n\nPrecambrian basement rocks (Riccomini 1989). This deformation is probably related to the \n\ncontext of the Aruj\u00e1 Structural High that separates the S\u00e3o Paulo Basin from Taubat\u00e9 Basin. \n\nFault population comprises reverse and strike-slip faults with reverse components trending \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nNW-SE and NE-SW (Figure 16b). NE-SW-trending faults are basement-controlled whilst \n\nNW-SE to N-S-trending faults are transverse structures. Paleostress determination (Figure \n\n17b) indicates a clear NW-SE-oriented compression with a NE-SW-oriented extensional \n\ncomponent. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented extension. In: a) T-01; b) T-06; c) T-13. Blue is \nthe extensional field while red is the compressional field  \n\nThe strike-slip fault in site T-13 at the northern border of the Resende Basin intercepts \n\nthe normal syn-sedimentary transverse structures related to the rift installation, and are \n\nassociated with folding. Paleostress determination (Figure 17c) clearly indicates NW-SE-\n\noriented compression and a NE-SW-oriented extensional, in a strike-slip regime of \n\ndeformation. \n\nE-W to NW-SE-oriented extension (Holocene) \n\nAccording to Riccomini (1989) and Riccomini et al. (2004) the stress-field with E-W- \n\nto NW-SE-oriented extension has affected the colluvial and alluvial deposits of Pleistocene to \n\nHolocene age. It corresponds to the third deformational event in the CRSB. Transverse faults \n\nrelated to this event could be observed directly in seven places. With the exception of T-10 \n\nc a b \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nsite, located in the central region of Resende Basin, all other are in the central part of Taubat\u00e9 \n\nBasin. \n\nSite T-10 is located in the central part of the Resende Basin in the region of the Resende \n\nStructural High. NNW-SSE- to NE-SW-oriented post-sedimentary normal faults with \n\nmoderate dip to the W intercepts deposits of the Resende and S\u00e3o Paulo formations, as well as \n\nstone line and colluvium. Individual fault throw reach more 5 m. Paleostress analysis allowed \n\nthe determinations of an E-W-oriented direction of extension (Figure 18a). \n\nAt Site T-14, south of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos (Taubat\u00e9 Basin), a N-S-oriented, \n\nsubvertical normal fault affects mudstone of the Resende Formation with a minimum throw of \n\n2 m (Figure 18b). An E-W-direction of extension can be deduced for this fault. Due the \n\nsubvertical dip this fault probably results from reactivation of an older strike-slip fault. \n\nSite T-11 is located southeast of Taubat\u00e9. It was studied by Riccomini et al. (1989) and \n\ncomprises a set of predominantly N-S- to NNE-SSW-oriented conjugate normal faults with \n\nmoderate to high dips. Individual fault throw reaches more than 8 m (Figure 18c). Faults are \n\npost-sedimentary and affects fluvial meandering deposits (alternate layers of sandstone and \n\nmudstone) of the Pindamonhangaba Formation as well as overlying stone-line and a sandy \n\ncolluvium. Paleostress analysis pointed a general E-W- to WNW-ESE-oriented direction of \n\nextension for this fault population. Some of these faults are subvertical and terminates in \n\nnegative flower structures. \n\nSites T-07, T-08, T-15 and T-16 are located near Ca\u00e7apava, in the region of the \n\nCa\u00e7apava Structural High, Taubat\u00e9 Basin. Site T-08 is a road cut at Presidente Dutra Highway \n\nand was studied by Riccomini et al. (1989). A set of NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW-oriented \n\nconjugate normal faults with moderate to high dips, and presenting individual throws from \n\ndecimeters to more than 1 m affects fluvial deposits of the Pindamonhangaba Formation, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nstone-line and colluvium (Figure 18d). Site T-08, previously studied by Mancini (1995) is a \n\nroad cut along the Ca\u00e7apava to Ca\u00e7apava Velha secondary road and comprises conjugate NE-\n\nSW and N-S-oriented normal faults with moderate dips affecting deposits of the \n\nPindamonhangaba Formation (Figure 18e).  \n\nSites T-15 and T-16 are located in the area of construction of a new airport (Aerovale) \n\nnear Ca\u00e7apava Velha. At site T-15 a normal fault trending NNE with moderate dip to WNW \n\n(Figure 18f), with a minimum throw of 4 m, truncates mudstone and sandstone of the Resende \n\nFormation and controls a syn-tectonic deposition of a Holocene muddy to pebbly colluvium, \n\nas evidenced by the thickening of the colluvial deposit towards the fault surface (Figure 19). \n\nSite T-16 displays two families of normal faults, one trending NE-SW with moderate to high \n\ndips to NW and throws from 0.5 to 3 m, and the other, transverse, trending N-S- to NW-SE \n\n(Figure 18g), with moderate dips and individual throws from 1 to more than 6 m. Cross-\n\ncutting relationship between the two families suggests that they are conjugate (v.g. Caputo, \n\n1995). These faults truncate sandstone and mudstone of the Resende Formation as well as \n\noverlying stone-line and sandy-clayey colluvium (Figures 20 and 21). \n\nPaleostress determinations indicate a general E-W- (sites T-07 and 16) to WNW-ESE- \n\n(sites T-15 and 16) oriented direction of extension for the analyzed faults.  \n\n \n\na \nc b \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - E-W- to NW-SE-oriented extensional field.

Transverse faults related to the E-W-oriented compressional field were \n\nstudied in four sites. \n\nSite T-04 is situated along the Jaguari Fault Zone (Figure 11), a Neoproterozoic shear \n\nzone that limits an isolated occurrence of sedimentary deposits of the S\u00e3o Paulo Formation in \n\nthe southwestern part of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. All faults of this site have reverse component of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nmovement and show variable strikes and low to high dip angles at this basin (Figure 22a). \n\nPaleostress analysis indicate an E-W-oriented compression. \n\nSites T-02 and T-03 were previously studied by Mancini (1995) and are located in the \n\ncontext of the Ca\u00e7apava Structural High (Figure 11). Site T-02 comprise two faults affecting \n\ndeposits of the Pindamonhangaba Formation. One is NW-SE-oriented, left-lateral strike-slip, \n\nand the other a NE-SW-oriented, right-lateral strike-slip fault, both with normal components \n\nand moderate dip to NE and NW, respectively. Site T-03 comprises two N-to-NNE-oriented \n\nreverse faults, with moderate dip angles to the E, affecting deposits of the Resende Formation \n\n(Figures 22b, c). Faults of these sites are compatible with an E-W-oriented compression. \n\nSite T-17 is located in the Resende Structural High and was previously studied by \n\nRiccomini (1989) and Riccomini et al. (1989) (Figure 11). It comprise thrust and strike-slip \n\nfaults with reverse components, with variable orientations and individual throws from some \n\ncentimeters to more than 1 m. They affect deposits of the S\u00e3o Paulo Formation, fluvial \n\nterraces, stone-line and colluvium.  \n\nPaleostress analysis pointed a general E-W- to WNW-ESE-oriented direction of \n\ncompression for this fault population (Figure 22c). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na b c \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 - E-W-oriented compressional field.

Isopach maps of Santos Basin \n\nAlthough there are some research that have connected faults offshore and onshore, \n\nstructural maps displaying transverse faults in the passive margin basins of southeastern \n\nBrazil are unavailable in the literature, as a result of conditions of use and confidentiality by \n\noil companies. For this reason, in order to relate the tectonic events in the Taubat\u00e9 Basin with \n\nthe Santos Basin were selected isopach maps of Santos Basin, published in the superb paper \n\nby Assine et al.(2008), relative to the interval from Upper Campanian-Maastrichtian, with the \n\nuplift of the region of Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira ranges, until Upper Miocene-\n\nRecent. The depocenter migration may be related to formation of structures induced by \n\ntectonic forces that may acted in continental and marine areas. \n\nThe Upper Campanian to Maastrichtian time-interval preceded the installation of the \n\nContintental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. In the continent occurred the alkaline magmatism \n\nand the uplift of the area that nowadays encompasses to the Serra do Mar and Serra da \n\nMantiqueira. According to Assine et al. (2008), the sedimentary sequence is characterized by \n\nprogradational coastal system, related to a major availability of sediments from continental \n\narea. \n\nd \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23 - Isopach maps of Santos Basin during the Upper Campanian \u2013 Maastrichtian. In orange: basins of the \nCentral Segment of Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil (modified from Assine et al., 2008.  \n\nIn the Figure 23 it is possible to observe three main depocenters that are separated by \n\ntwo major NW-SE-trending structures. The region of greater accumulation of sediments are \n\nmainly in front of the uplifted area of Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira. \n\nThe formation of original depression of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil \n\noccurred in the Paleogene, being the oldest basin (S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o do Itabora\u00ed Basin) from the \n\nPaleocene-Eocene (Riccomini et al., 2004). The isopach map of Figure 24 covers the Paleocene \n\nto Eocene/Lower Oligocene time-interval, and comprehends the installation and deposition of \n\nthe rift section of the CRSB. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24 - Isopach maps of Santos Basin during the Paleocene - Oligocene. In orange: basins of the Central \nSegment of Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil; in red: lineaments (modified from Assine et al., 2008). \n\nAccording to Assine et al. (2008) the limit between Cretaceous and Paleogene is an \n\nimportant unconformity that coincides with a global sea level fall. The depocenters are \n\nelongated with strike almost parallel to the coastal line, and roughly parallel to the CRSB. The \n\nsedimentary package are thicker near the Cabo Frio High, structure that separate the Santos \n\nBasin from Campos Basin. The thinner sedimentary packs occur near the coastline in the S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo state. Some authors, as Zal\u00e1n and Oliveira (2005), defined that the flat surface in the \n\nbasement in the continental platform of the Santos Basin represents a regional planation \n\nsurface, named as Japi Surface of the end of Cretaceous (Almeida, 1964), in its lower limit. \n\nThe alignment of depocenters in Santos Basin would be a repercussion of the NW-SE-\n\noriented extensional field. Two main structures can be observed with probable link between \n\nthe Santos Basin and the adjoining continental \u00e1rea: a) the Aruj\u00e1 Structural High, which \n\nseparates the S\u00e3o Paulo and Taubat\u00e9 basins and whose prolongation offshore marks the left-\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nlateral displacement of ENE-WSW-oriented depocenters in Santos Basin (Figure 24, \n\nlineament A); b) the Queluz Structural High, which separates the Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins, \n\ncausing a right-lateral displacement of depocenters in Santos Basin (Figure 24, lineament B).  \n\nIsopach map of Upper Miocene to Lower Miocene time-interval (Figure 25) clearly \n\nshows the permanence of the lineament A, related to the Aruj\u00e1 Structural High onshore, \n\nwhich in combination with other NW-SE-oriented transverse structures of the southwestern \n\npart of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin (lineament C, Figure 25). A wide shallow region is observed in the \n\ncoastal region adjoining the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. The zone of separation between the Taubat\u00e9 and \n\nResende basins shows at that time a clear prolongation along a WNW-ESE-oriented shallow \n\nregion (lineament D, Figure 25). \n\n \n\nFigure 25 - Isopach maps from Santos Basin during the Upper Oligocene to Lower Miocene. In orange: basins \nfrom Central Segment of Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil; in red: lineaments (modified from Assine et al. \n2008) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe isopach map of Figure 26 corresponds to the time-interval between the Miocene \n\nand the Recent. This time-interval encompasses three deformational events in the Taubat\u00e9 and \n\nResende basins. The influence of lineament A, as well as the shallow coastal region in front of \n\nTaubat\u00e9 Basin remained. NW-SE-oriented structures, as those observed in Taubat\u00e9 Basin \n\nseem to have influenced the depocenter control in the adjoining region in the Santos Basin. \n\n \n\nFigure 26 - Isopach maps of Santos Basin during the Miocene to Recent.

DISCUSSION \n\n5.1 Seismic interpretation \n\nThe seismic profile 225-0061 (Figure 6) crosses the Eug\u00eanio de Melo Sub-basin \n\n(Marques 1990), with the Ca\u00e7apava Structural High to the west where Precambrian basement \n\nrocks crops out. According to Riccomini (1989) this high is strongly conditioned by NNE-\n\noriented faults generated and reactivated during the NW-SE-oriented compressive \n\ndeformation event that occurred during the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. Using gravimetric \n\ndata, Fernandes and Chang (2002) modeled the Ca\u00e7apava High as a non-exposed alkaline \n\nbody, which might be interfering in deformational processes that originated the basins of the \n\nCRSB. This alkaline body could be acted as a discontinuity that allowed its permanence as a \n\nhigh during the rift opening. \n\nSome authors have considered an onlap contact between the basement and the Unit B \n\nand the Resende Formation, concluding that the highs are active during the sedimentation \n\n(Marques, 1990; Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2013), especially in the Ca\u00e7apava High. Nonetheless, the onlap \n\ncontact on the west side of the profile is dubious. There is a possibility that the high was \n\nformed during a deformational event, corroborated by the edge faults and the deformation of \n\nthe sedimentary pack that become progressively steep as it nears to the structural high. Thus, \n\nthe contact between the sedimentary pile and the basement may demonstrate that not all highs \n\nwere formed by deformation events, and some of them were active during the sedimentation. \n\nThis seismic profile shows that the basement presents reverse and normal faults, but the \n\nstructure like folds in the basement were considered an artifact related to multiple reflections \n\nas the basement is composed of Neoproterozoic crystalline rocks (granitoids, gneisses, and \n\nmigmatites). These rocks are expected to be in ductile state to fold, which is not this case. \n\nMoreover, folds in crystalline rocks have a difficult interpretation on seismic profiles due the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\ninability of the current techniques to account for lateral variations in velocity and to display \n\nsteeply dipping reflectors (Ji and Long, 2006). \n\nThe seismic profile 225-0064 (Figure 8) crosses the Capela do Socorro (Marques, 1990) \n\nor Pindamonhangaba Structural High (Fernandes, 1993), separating the Quiririm and Roseira \n\ndepocenters. The sedimentary rocks are mainly deformed over the structural high, but the \n\ncontacts between them appear to remain near horizontal, which may indicate that the sediment \n\nwas already deposited when the high was active. The transverse folds in Trememb\u00e9 \n\nFormation described by Riccomini (1989), Takiya et al. (1990) and Silva (2007) are located \n\nin the area near this high. The deformation created by the reactivation of this high may have \n\nproduced folding in shale of the Trememb\u00e9 Formation during the NE-SW-oriented \n\ncompressional event of a probable Miocene age (Riccomini et al., 2004).  \n\nThe seismic profiles 225-0065 and 225-0063 (Figures 9 and 10) crosses the Roseira \n\ndepocenter, the only sub-basin with Unit A, the oldest in the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. The presence of a \n\nseismic unit exclusively in the Roseira Sub-basin as well as the contact relationship between \n\nthe sedimentary pack and the basement in some structural highs might demonstrate that the \n\ninitial rift opening would had occurred in segments, as in the conceptual models presented by \n\nGawthorpe and Leeder (2000). The process of fault propagation, growth and death mainly \n\ncontrols the basin architecture. Thus, basin linkage by burial or breaching of the relays and \n\ncrossover basement ridges is the dominant mechanism whereby hydrologically closed rifts \n\nevolve into open ones (Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000). \n\nAccording to Riccomini et al. (2004) there are two anticlines in the area, one is the \n\nCa\u00e7apava Structural High, trending NE-SW and the other is the Pindamonhangaba Structural \n\nHigh trending NW-SE. The conceptual model described by Gawthorpe and Leeder (2000) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nforesee the presence of transverse anticlines in the hangingwall of normal faults, associated \n\nwith minimum displacement at segment boundaries. \n\nFurthermore, the presence of a pre-existing structural fabric influences the structural \n\ndevelopment of the rift system. In extensional settings influenced by a pre-existent structural \n\nfabric the mode of fault growth may differ from established fault grown models (Whipp et al., \n\n2014). \n\nThe Taubat\u00e9 Basin had inherited a previously basement discontinuity from the Ribeira \n\nBelt and related shear zones. This fact may have propitiated a quick opening of the rift, \n\nconsidering that only Unit A is missing from other seismic profiles. In consequence, it is not \n\nnecessary to claim a transcurrence to explain the RCSB opening. The existence of active \n\nstructural highs and exclusive sedimentary packs in one sub-basin would be related to border \n\nfault grown, in an extensional regime. The Figure 27 illustrate conceptual model of \n\nGawthorpe and Leeder (2000). \n\n \n\nFigure 27 - Schematic 3D evolution of a normal fault array (adapted from Gawthorpe &amp; Leeder, 2000). \n\nConsidering this model for Taubat\u00e9 Basin it is possible to explain the existence of only \n\none sub-basin nestling the seismic Unit A. Consequently, this segment was the first to form \n\nand was delimited by the Pindamonhangaba High, as an anticline. Afterwards the other \n\nsegments were formed and linked, maintaining the structural highs active, as the Ca\u00e7apava \n\nHigh. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Structural analysis \n\nThe Continental Rift of Southeastern Brasil has a polyphasic tectonic evolution. After \n\nan initial extensional phase with NNW-SSE-oriented extension, four deformational phases \n\ninvolving reactivations along previous faults and subordinately the formation of new ones are \n\nrecognized (Riccomini, 1989; Riccomini et al., 2004): a) a strike-slip regime, with NW-SE-\n\noriented extension and local NE-SW-oriented compression, active during the Neogene \n\n(Miocene); b) a NW-SE-oriented Late Pleistocene to Holocene compressive stress regime \n\nfollowed; c) an E-W- to NW-SE-oriented Holocene extension; d) and an E-W-oriented \n\ncompression. There are transverse structures in Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins related to the \n\ngeneration and deformation of the CRSB. \n\nTransverse structures related to the NW-SE-oriented extension (Eocene - Oligocene) are \n\nrepresented by syn-sedimentary normal faults (sites T-12 and T-13). Paleostress analysis of \n\nthese faults indicates a general extensional field trending NE-SW, with a vertical \n\ncompressional field. The direction of extension is at low angle with the direction of the master \n\nfault in both sites, located in the northern border of the basins. This result is apparently \n\nincompatible with the initial stress field related to the rift opening, identified as an extensional \n\nfield trending NW-SE (v.g. Riccomini et al., 2004). The studied section in the Resende Basin \n\ncorresponds to the upper part of the Taubat\u00e9 Group suggesting that this extension has \n\noccurred in a final stage of rift phase. \n\nBased on stress ellipsoids and their relationship with the formation of structures, in an \n\nextensional regime it is expected that normal faults would be created perpendicularly to ?3 \n\n(direction of maximum extension). Nonetheless, according to Gibbs (1984, 1990) graben \n\nusually shows fault trends at a high angle to the margins, as transverse faults, and in some \n\ncases these have been interpreted as later faults. These faults are related to the normal faults \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nformation and where called as transfer faults. They allow the escape of tension between \n\nextension faults with different slip rates. The main characteristic of these faults is the strike-\n\nslip movement and the connection with two distinct normal faults. \n\nDestro (1995) and Destro et al. (2003), based on outcrop and seismic data in the \n\nSergipe-Alagoas Basin, suggested a new type of cross-fault, denominated release fault. \n\nRelease faults are geometrically required to accommodate variable displacement along the \n\nstrike of a normal fault as a result of the increase in length of the hangingwall by bending or \n\nflexure in the strike direction. They are a type of cross faults and do not cut normal fault \n\nplanes nor detachment surfaces at depth. Other important characteristic is the type of \n\nmovement that seems normal without implying in extension along the strike of the basin. \n\nRegarding the deformation, release faulting is associated with plane strain deformation in \n\nlinked extensional fault system (Destro, 1995). Therefore, it is possible to relate transverse \n\nfaults to an extensional regime, and these faults might be transfer or release faults. \n\nMoreover, according to Destro et al. (2003) the release-faulting model predicts that \n\nlocal paleostress field can strongly diverge from regional one. The stress ellipsoid in the \n\nfootwall of the normal fault reproduces the regional stresses, where the maximum principal \n\nstress (?1) is vertical, and the minimum principal stress (?3) is parallel to the extension \n\ndirection. In release faults, which behave as normal faults, and in release fractures the \n\nintermediate principal stress (?2) and the minimum principal stress (?3) switch positions and \n\nthe maximum principal stress (?1) remains vertical (Figure 28). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28 - Conceptual model of stress field in normal and release faults. A) Regional paleostress field; B) Role \nswap between ?2 and ?3, causing the formation of release faults. C) Perpendicularly to ?3, release fractures may \ndevelop parallel to release faults. D) Reversion among the three principal stresses, forming a reverse fault \n(adapted from Destro et al., 2003) \n\nIn the conceptual model of release faults formation is admitted the development of \n\nreverse faults locally. Where the downslip is great, compression might occur in the hanging \n\nwall, swapping ?1 by ?3. In this case, ?3 becomes vertical and ?1 parallel to the strike of \n\nparent fault (Destro et al., 2003). \n\nSyn-sedimentary normal faults at the northern borders of the Resende and Taubat\u00e9 \n\nbasins are related to master faults and apparently do not intercept nor connect different normal \n\nfaults. Furthermore, they tend to be oblique to nearly perpendicular to the strike of main \n\nfaults. The swapping between ?2 and ?3, considering the regional stress field, is also an \n\nimportant indication that the normal faults described in sites T-12 and T-13 might be \n\nconsidered as release faults, and they are compatible with the regional paleostress field. \n\nTransverse structures related to NE-SW-oriented compression and NW-SE-oriented \n\nextension (Miocene) comprise faults and folds. Faults are in part syn-sedimentary in relation \n\nto the Itaquaquecetuba Formation. Non-cylindrical, NW-SE-oriented folds in lacustrine shale \n\nof Trememb\u00e9 Formation in the central part of the Taubat\u00e9 basin are recognized in outcrop \n\n(Riccomini, 1989) and regional map scale (Takiya et al., 1990; Silva, 2007). According to \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSilva (2007), these folds present en echelon pattern, both in outcrop and map scale. Fluvial \n\ndeposits of Pindamonhangaba Formation overlying lacustrine shales are unfolded and \n\nseparated by an unconformity (Riccomini, 1989). Gawthorpe and Leeder (2000) and Destro et \n\nal. (2003) proposed models that predict transverse syn-rift structures formed by a local \n\ncompression, as folds and reverse faults, respectively. Schlische (1995) pointed that \n\nsynfolding sedimentary deposits, formed in an extensional setting, are thicker in the hinges of \n\nsynclines and thinner in the hinge of anticlines. In the Taubat\u00e9 case, thickness of Trememb\u00e9 \n\nFormation is nearly uniform and folding presents an en echelon array, which is typical of a \n\nstrike-slip deformation (v.g. Harding 1985). Considering the timing of deformation, post-\n\nTrememb\u00e9 and pre-Pindamonhangaba Formation, and the direction of fold axes, they are \n\nrelated to the deformational event with NE-SW-oriented compression, of Miocene age. \n\nDeformation related to this event was responsible for generation of transverse structural \n\nhighs in the basins. Deposition of the Itaquaquecetuba Formation next to the Aruj\u00e1 Structural \n\nHigh was related to this event. The capture of the headwaters of Tiet\u00ea River by the Para\u00edba do \n\nSul River also occurred during this event and changed the sedimentary supply from Santos to \n\nCampos Basin (Riccomini et al., 2010). \n\nThe NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented extension (Late Pleistocene \u2013 \n\nHolocene) has generated mainly normal transverse faults with a general NW-SE-orientation \n\nthat affects stone-line and colluvium. Given the subvertical dip of some faults and the \n\nsuperposition of striae verified in some cases is likely that they represent reactivations of \n\nolder strike-slip, transverse faults of the first deformational event, which in turn may indicate \n\nthe presence of syn-rift, NW-SE-oriented transfer faults in this region of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. \n\nTransverse faults associated with the E-W- to NW-SE-oriented extension (Holocene) \n\nhave widespread occurrence both in Resende and Taubat\u00e9 basins. These faults have a general \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nN-S to NNE-WSW-direction and truncate Pindamonhangaba Formation and overlying stone-\n\nline and a sandy colluvium. The presence of negative flower structures in the termination of \n\nsome subvertical normal faults indicate a probable previous strike-slip movement. These data \n\nare in agreement with Mancini (1995) who pointed the predominance of normal faults, \n\ntrending NNW and NNE in this region. Yet, they indicate a clear dominance of an extensional \n\nregime during the Holocene in the region of the Ca\u00e7apava Structural High.  \n\nTransverse faults related to the E-W-oriented compression (current stress-field) are \n\nscarcely represented in the study area. The most common structural feature related to this \n\nstress-regime is a widespread set of neotectonic conjugate hybrid and shear joints in colluvial \n\nand alluvial deposits, mainly in the eastern part of the Taubat\u00e9 and western part of the \n\nResende basins (Salvador, 1994; Salvador and Riccomini, 1995), which corresponds to \n\nneotectonic joints in the sense of Hancock and Engelder (1989). In the studied cases the \n\nvariable direction and nature of faults indicate that they were generated during previous \n\ndeformational events and reactivated under the E-W-compressional stress-field. This is the \n\nreason for the high dispersion in the position of striae related to this last deformational event, \n\nas the faults were reactivated probably in a non-ideal surface \n\nThis E-W-oriented compressional stress field is compatible with the present-day stress-\n\nfield (Assump\u00e7\u00e3o, 1992, 1998). The southeastern Brazil is located intraplate, and this type of \n\ntectonism is related to several mechanisms. According to Assump\u00e7\u00e3o (1992), this \n\ncompression results from a combination of regional stress (which is related to plate boundary \n\nforces and spreading effects due to continent/oceanic crust transition), local flexural effects \n\nfrom thick sedimentary loads (in the passive margin basins as Santos and Campos Basin) and \n\na weaker crust from Mesozoic thinning. \n\n5.3 Isopach maps \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe Santos Basin constitutes one of the largest marginal depression in the passive \n\nmargin of Brazil (Macedo, 1989). Its adjacent continental area is formed by crustal blocks of \n\nthe Ribeira Belt that were tectonically active during the evolution of the basin. The west limit \n\nof the Santos Basin comprehends the belt of coastal ranges as Serra do Mar and Serra da \n\nMantiqueira, where the basins from the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil were installed. \n\nThe continental area adjacent to the Santos, Campos and Esp\u00edrito Santo basins is \n\ncharacterized by a high topography, with elevations reaching up to 2000 m (Mohriak et al., \n\n2008). The origin of this mountain range has been considered as related to the retreat of the \n\nuplifted margin from Cretaceous until present (Gallagher et al. 1994; Almeida and Carneiro, \n\n1998), secondary flexural bulge generated during rifting that persisted to the present day \n\n(Sacek et al., 2012), or rejuvenation of the topography by Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic \n\nuplift (Hiruma et al., 2010; Cogn\u00e9 et al., 2011, 2012; Franco-Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2014). \n\nFollowing continental break-up the continental margin did not behave as a typical passive \n\nmargin, and a series of Paleogene basins were installed near the continental margin, along the \n\nSerra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira.  \n\nThroughout the geological evolution of Santos Basin, the basin fill was altered by the \n\ntectonic events to which the continent and continental margins were subjected. During the \n\nUpper Cretaceous, strong sedimentary pulses in the Santos Basin were correlated to \n\nexpressive uplifts in the continental area, being associated with plutonic alkaline magmatism \n\nas registered in the Itatiaia Massif. Later, during the Neogene, the sedimentation of the Santos \n\nBasin became fine-grained and with a minor significance caused by the headwater capture of \n\nTiet\u00ea River, thus the coarse sediments were transported by the Para\u00edba do Sul River that \n\ndebouch in the area of the Campos Basin (Macedo, 1989).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTherefore it is possible to connect the Cenozoic tectonics and sedimentation of the \n\nSantos Basin with the formation and evolution of Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins.  \n\nAsmus and Ferrari (1978), Kumar and Gamboa (1979) and Macedo (1989) proposed \n\nthat some offshore transfer faults would have a continuity towards the continent, as the \n\nTransfer Zones of Florian\u00f3polis and Curitiba. According to Macedo (1989) these transfer \n\nzones have an important role in the oil industry, with the major occurrences of oil in the \n\nSantos Basin located nearby the transfer zones. Souza et al. (2009), using STRM digital \n\nelevation models, identified transverse or sub-transverse structures to the coast, with NW-SE \n\ndirection, in the Precambrian basement of coastal area of southeastern Brazil. Based on \n\nseismic profiles, these structures were related to faults and to the evolution and deformation of \n\nthe north portion of the Santos Basin. \n\nThis linkage between onshore and offshore faults was also pointed in Campos Basin \n\n(Louren\u00e7o et al. 2014) based on interpretation of high-resolution airborne magnetic data. \n\nThese faults have the same NW-SE-direction indicated by Souza et al. (2009) in the Santos \n\nBasin. The faults mapped in the Campos Basin were related to structures in the Barra de S\u00e3o \n\nJo\u00e3o Graben, a basin of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil located in the Rio de \n\nJaneiro state (Louren\u00e7o et al. 2014). \n\nBased on the interpretation of the transverse structures in seismic profiles, Souza et al. \n\n(2009) recognized four deformational events that affected the Santos Basin. The last two \n\nevents are related to the formation and deformation of the basins of the Continental Rift of \n\nSoutheastern Brazil. During the Paleocene, in seismic profiles, were identified normal, reverse \n\nand transfer faults sectioning the Eocene section in the Santos Basin. The last phase is \n\nassociated with neotectonic events, with faults intercepting the Miocene section. The transfer \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nfaults were correlated by Souza et al. (2009) with transverse structures in the S\u00e3o Paulo, \n\nTaubat\u00e9, Resende basins as well as with structural highs inside and separating these basins. \n\nDuring the rift opening, the CRSB was under a NW-SE- to NNW-SSE-oriented \n\nextension, generating normal faults trending E-W to ENE-WNW. As explained previously \n\nthere are two types of transverse faults that are related to extensional regime: transfer faults \n\n(Gibbs 1984, 1990) and release faults (Destro, 1998 and Destro et al. 2003). The main \n\ndifference between transfer and release faults are the movement (strike-slip or normal dip-\n\nslip) and the linkage between normal fault planes (only transfer faults connect two or more \n\nfaults). Among the structural data, there were one fault set related to release faults, but the \n\nsedimentary register of transverse faults associated to the initial extensional stress-field is \n\nscarce.  \n\nThe alignment of depocenters in Santos Basin would be a repercussion of the NW-SE-\n\noriented extensional field. Two transverse structures have a probable link between the Santos \n\nBasin and the central segment of the CRSB, the lineaments A (the continuity of the Aruj\u00e1 \n\nStructural High) and B (the prolongation of the Queluz Structural High) (Figure 24). These \n\nstructures are probable transfer zones in the Santos Basin, as they imposed a seesaw \n\nmovement in the basin, with depocenter between A and B lineaments displacing \n\nnorthwestwards in relation to depocenters to the SW and NW.  \n\nIn the Lower Miocene the left-lateral transcurrence, with a compression trending NW-\n\nSE, promoted an important change in the Taubat\u00e9 Basin. The previous pattern was altered by \n\nthe formation of structural highs that segmented the rift. One of these highs changed the \n\ndrainage, with the capture of the Tiet\u00ea River headwater by the Para\u00edba do Sul River. \n\nMoreover, the blocks in the Taubat\u00e9 Basin tilted as a seesaw.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAs shown in the isopach map of Upper Miocene to Lower Miocene time-interval \n\n(Figure 25), lineaments A and C (Figure 25) seem to configure a major transfer zone limiting \n\nshallow areas of the basement in the Santos Basin to NW and SE, respectively to the N and S \n\nof this zone. The shallow region along the coastal region adjoining the Taubat\u00e9 Basin may \n\nsuggest that, together with this segment of the Serra do Mar, the entire region experienced \n\nuplift. The continuity of a WNW-ESE-oriented fault zone offshore (lineament D, Figure 25) \n\nprobably represents a relay ramp zone in Santos Basin. This zone is probably exposed \n\nonshore along the WNW-ESE-oriented Funil Fault Zone (Riccomini, 1989) and the faults in \n\nthe Itatiaia alkaline Massif, of the same orientation (Figure, 15). \n\nAccording to Assine et al. (2008), after the Miocene the region was marked by eustatic \n\nfluctuations related to global cycles of glaciation. The time-interval between the Late \n\nPleistocene and the Recent comprises three deformational events in the central segment of the \n\nCRSB. The isopach map of Miocene to Recent (Figure 26) evince that Lineament A was still \n\nactive at that time and probably some transverse structures played some role on the control of \n\ndepocenters in the Santos Basin. \n\nIt seems clear that only the NW-SE-oriented structures exerted influence in the Santos \n\nBasin during its Cenozoic evolution. These structures were active predominantly as transfer \n\nfaults that have divided the basin in compartments. In particular, lineament A, which \n\ncorresponds to the extent offshore of the Aruj\u00e1 Structural High, seems to have had a long-\n\nlived, multiphase activity during the Cenozoic. Major oil fields in the Santos Basin are \n\nlocalized in the region adjoining the Taubat\u00e9 and Resende basins, roughly between NW-SE-\n\noriented lineaments A and B. This fact would suggest that these structures together other NW-\n\nSE-oriented faults and folds may have influenced, respectively, the migration routes and \n\nstructural traps in the Santos Basin. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6. CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe main focus of this paper was the study of the transverse structures in the Taubat\u00e9 \n\nand Resende basins focusing on their nature, geometry, kinematics, relationships with \n\nsedimentation, age, the stress field active during their generation and deformation, and \n\nregional correlations. Besides, the possible physical continuity of these structures and/or the \n\naction of stress fields related to them into the Santos Basin and the implications for the \n\ntectonic framework and evolution of this basin were also analyzed. The key conclusion of this \n\nstudy are as follow: \n\na) transverse faults in longitudinal seismic profiles are usually steep, with normal, reverse and \n\nstrike-slip character; all the seismic units are deformed by faults, including the younger \n\nsedimentary packs, but all faults were identified as pre and post-sedimentary; \n\nb) structural highs were identified in seismic profiles, some of them active during the \n\ninstallation of the Taubat\u00e9 Basin; \n\nc) the existence of active structural highs and exclusive sedimentary packs in one sub-basin \n\nwould be related to border fault grown, in an extensional regime \n\nd) fault-slip data inversion and paleostress determination allowed to identify that there are \n\ntransverse structures related to the five tectonic events previously reported to the central \n\nsegment of the CRSB; \n\ne) transverse structures related to the initial NW-SE-oriented extensional event (Eocene - \n\nOligocene) are represented by syn-sedimentary normal faults related to master faults and \n\napparently not intercepting nor connecting different normal faults; these faults indicate a \n\ngeneral extensional field trending NE-SW, which allowed to classify them as release faults; \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nf) transverse faults associated with the NE-SW-oriented compression and NW-SE-oriented \n\nextension (Miocene) are in part syn-sedimentary in relation to the Itaquaquecetuba Formation; \n\nthe nearly uniform thickness of folded layers of Trememb\u00e9 Formation associated with their en \n\nechelon array, indicate that they are related to the deformational event with NE-SW-oriented \n\ncompression; \n\ng) transverse faults related to the NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented \n\nextension (Late Pleistocene \u2013 Holocene) are mainly normal, with a general NW-SE-\n\norientation, affecting stone-line and colluvium; some of these faults with subvertical dip and \n\nshowing superposition of striae probably represent reactivations of older strike-slip, transverse \n\nfaults; \n\nh) the E-W- to NW-SE-oriented extension (Holocene) has generated transverse faults with a \n\ngeneral N-S- to NNE-WSW-direction that truncate the Pindamonhangaba Formation and \n\noverlying stone-line and a sandy colluvium;  \n\ni) a few faults related to the E-W-oriented compression (current stress-field) were recognized \n\nin the study area; the variable direction and nature of faults indicate that they were generated \n\nduring previous deformational events and reactivated, thus showing high dispersion in the \n\nposition of striae related to this last deformational event as the faults were reactivated along \n\nnon-ideal previous fault surfaces; \n\nj) only the NW-SE-oriented structures exerted influence in the Santos Basin during its \n\nCenozoic evolution; five lineaments with this direction were recognized in isopach maps, \n\nshowing a probable continuity offshore and controlling depocenters in the Santos Basin: the \n\nlineaments A (the continuity of the Aruj\u00e1 Structural High) and B (the prolongation of the \n\nQueluz Structural High), during the Paleocene-Oligocene; lineaments A, C and lineament D, \n\nduring the Miocene; and lineaments A and E during the Late-Pleistocene to Recent. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nh) these structures were active predominantly as transfer faults, which have divided the basin \n\nin compartments; in particular, lineament A, corresponding to the extent offshore of the Aruj\u00e1 \n\nStructural High, seems to have had a long-lived, multiphase activity during the Cenozoic; \n\ni) major oil fields in the Santos Basin are localized in the region adjoining the Taubat\u00e9 and \n\nResende basins, roughly between NW-SE-oriented lineaments A and B, which would suggest \n\nthe combined influence of these structures together other NW-SE-oriented faults and folds in \n\nthe migration routes and formation of structural traps in the Santos Basin. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nWe thank the Programa de Recursos Humanos Petrobras PRH-241, Ag\u00eancia Nacional \n\ndo Petr\u00f3leo, G\u00e1s Natural e Biocombust\u00edveis (ANP, Brazil)), Financiadora de Estudos e \n\nProjetos (FINEP, Brazil, grant Ref. 1452/13) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento \n\nCient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq, Brazil, grant #307871/2010-0) for the financial support. \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAb'S\u00e1ber, A.
