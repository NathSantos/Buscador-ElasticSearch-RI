Os BSF encontram aplica\u00e7\u00f5es nas mais diversas \u00e1reas, \n\nnomeadamente nas ind\u00fastrias alimentar e do petr\u00f3leo, no controle de biofilmes \n\nmicrobianos e na preven\u00e7\u00e3o da biocorros\u00e3o, biofouling e desenvolvimento de \n\nbiofilmes. s\u00e3o ainda usados como ingredientes em produtos terap\u00eauticos, de \n\ncuidado pessoal e cosm\u00e9ticos.  \n\nOs BSF representam uma alternativa vantajosa aos surfactantes qu\u00edmicos \n\nporque s\u00e3o menos t\u00f3xicos, mais biodegrad\u00e1veis e est\u00e1veis em temperaturas e \n\npH extremos.

Estirpes de Bacillus licheniformis e Pseudomonas sp \n\nprodutoras de BSF foram co cultivadas com estirpes indutoras (Pseudomonas \n\naeruginosa e Listeria innocua) de maneira a estimular a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de surfactina \n\ne ramnol\u00edpidos, respetivamente.

O m\u00e9todo \n\nCPC-BTB foi usado para quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de surfatina e ramnol\u00edpidos, ambos \n\nsurfactantes ani\u00f3nicos, e o m\u00e9todo de orcinol foi usado para a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nramnol\u00edpidos.

Os \n\nresultados do teste do CTAB-azul de metileno indicaram que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nBSF em B. licheniformis foi mais estimulada em co-cultivo com P. aeruginosa. \n\nN\u00e3o se verificaram diferen\u00e7as significativas no efeito tensioativo avaliado pelos \n\nm\u00e9todos do oil spray, colapso da gota cultivo emagar de sangue, nem pelo \n\nm\u00e9todo quantitativo do orcinol. \n\nOs resultados indicam que o co-cultivo afecta a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de BSF, embora \n\nn\u00e3o existam diferen\u00e7as no efeito tensioactivo, e que um maior rendimento de \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser obtido atrav\u00e9s da sele\u00e7\u00e3o das estirpes indutoras \n\nadequadas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nKeywords \n \n \nabstract \n\n \n\nPseudomonas; B. licheniformis; inducer strains; rhamnolipids; surfactin  \n\n \n\n \n\nBiosurfactants (BSF) are amphipathic compounds, produced by a vast range of \n\nmicroorganisms. They are able to reduce surface and interfacial tensions, as \n\nwell as to emulsify and transport hydrophobic substrates, to regulate cell \n\nadherence to surfaces and to interfere biofilm development.  \n\nBSF can have applications in diverse areas, such as petroleum and food \n\nindustries, control of biofouling and biofilm development, and are also used as \n\ningredients in therapeutic formulations, personal care products, and cosmetics. \n\nThey represent an advantageous alternative to chemical surfactants because \n\nthey less toxic, highly biodegradable and stable in extreme temperature and \n\npH. However, mass production and application of BSF is still limited by the low \n\nproduction yield and high production costs.  \n\nConsidering that BSF are secondary metabolites, the hypothesis that co-\n\ncultivation with biofilm-forming strains would induce BSF synthesis was tested. \n\nBSF producing strains of Bacillus licheniformis and Pseudomonas sp. were \n\ncultivated with inducing strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria \n\ninnocua) as a way to stimulate the production of surfactin and rhamnolipids, \n\nrespectively.   \n\nAxenic cultures and co-cultures were tested as to the tensoactive effect by the \n\noil spray method, cultivation in CTAB-methylene blue medium, cultivation in \n\nblood agar, and the drop collapse assay. The CPC-BTB method was used for \n\nthe quantification of surfactin and rhamnolipids, both anionic surfactants, and \n\nthe orcinol method for the quantification of rhamnolipids. Effect of the cultures \n\nand co-cultures in the quorum sensing inhibition in Chromobacterium \n\nviolaceum culture was also evaluated. \n\nResults of the CPC-BTB test indicate that the stimulation of BSF production by \n\nPseudomonas sp. was the highest in co-cultures with Listeria innocua. The \n\nresults of the CTAB-methylene blue test indicate that BSF production in B. \n\nlicheniformis was more stimulated by co-cultivation with P. aeruginosa. There \n\nwere no significant differences in the tensoactive effect of the cell-free extracts \n\nas determined by oil spray, the drop-collapse test or by the blood-agar test.  \n\nThe results indicate that co-cultivation affects the concentration of BSF, \n\nalthough it does not have an effect in the tensioactive effect of the BSF, and \n\nthat higher production yields can be attained by selecting convenient inducer \n\nstrains. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\ni \n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nList of figures ................................................................................................................ v \n\nList of tables ............................................................................................................... vii \n\nList of Abbreviations .................................................................................................... ix \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n \n\n1.1. Surfactants and biosurfactants \n\n \n\nChemical surfactants have had a major role in everyday life for more than a \n\ncentury, although their commercial success has only been increasing over the last \n\nfew decades. It has become a quickly evolving and profitable field, related with \n\ninnumerous applications such as detergency and emulsification, biofilm control, \n\nhealth and personal care products and environmental restoration and protection(1\u20136). \n\nSurfactants, or surface active agents, are amphiphilic molecules with \n\nhydrophobic and hydrophilic groups that allows them to interact with different gas, \n\nsolid and liquid interfaces. They are capable of reducing surface and interfacial \n\ntension, as well as to emulsify immiscible fluids (2,3,7). Surface tension refers to the \n\nforce that is wielded by a liquid solution when interacting with a solid or liquid. \n\nInterfacial tension is mainly the intermolecular force exerted by the molecules of \n\nliquid, when the interfacial tension of a solution is low, it can be easily emulsified (8,9) \n\nThe rapid rise of the surfactant market in recent years, and the fact that 70-\n\n75% of the surfactants currently commercialized in developed countries have a \n\npetrochemical source, has triggered an eager search for more viable and \n\nenvironmentally friendly alternatives (2,3,10). \n\nBiosurfactants (BSFs) are surfactants produced extracellularly, or as a cell \n\nmembrane component, by a wide range of microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts \n\nand fungi (11,12). They are usually secondary metabolites, produced at the end of the \n\nexponential phase or the beginning of the stationary phase. Structurally, they have \n\nsimilarities with their chemical counterparts, containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic \n\ndomains. The hydrophobic tail is composed mainly of acids, peptides or \n\npolysaccharides, while the hydrophilic moiety comprehends mostly hydrocarbon \n\nchains or fatty acids (6,8,13).The typical BSF structure can be observed in figure 1 \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Typical biosurfactant structure. Adapted from Santos et al. (2016) \n\n \n\nIn liquid solutions, BSFs can aggregate and form structures known as micelles, \n\nin which the hydrophobic groups are protected from contacting with the aqueous \n\nphase. Micelles can have various forms, depending on the BSF, and are affected by \n\ntemperature, pressure and presence of electrolytes. The concentration value at which \n\nmicelles are formed is denominated critical micelle concentration (CMC) and it \n\ncorresponds to the value at which the ability of the BSF to reduce surface tension is \n\nconsidered efficient. Lower CMC values, usually mean a higher efficiency of the BSF \n\n(3). The general structure of a micelle structure can be observed in figure 2. \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Micelles structure adapted from Malik et. al (2011) \n\n \n\nBSFs present several advantages over chemical surfactants, such as low \n\ntoxicity, higher biodegradability and higher stability in extreme conditions of \n\ntemperature, pH and salinity. They can also be synthesized from renewable sources \n\nsuch as ethanol, glycerol, vegetable oils and wastewater (1,7,11). \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nHowever, the cost of their production at an industrial scale is still very high, and \n\nso, there has been an increasing search for optimization in the cultivation processes \n\nof BSF producing microorganisms, in an effort to increasing their production yield and \n\nlower their production cost (12,14). \n\n \n\n1.2. Surfactant producing microorganisms \n\n \n\nBacteria are known to exhibit physiological and chemical adaptations when \n\npresented with extreme conditions or stress. In some of those cases, they produce \n\nsecondary metabolites, such as BSFs (15). BSFs can reduce surface and interfacial \n\ntension and solubilize hydrocarbons, which facilitates the microorganism growth in \n\nthose substrates. BSFs can also interfere in the regulation of bacterial population \n\ndensity and cell to cell communication (2,11,16). BSF producing bacteria are able to \n\ninhabit the most diverse habitats, whether terrestrial, aquatic or extreme conditions. \n\nThey are most likely found in areas with high levels of hydrocarbons or organic \n\nresidues, such as industrial zones, oil reservoirs, petroleum exploration areas and oil \n\ncontaminated site (17\u201322)  \n\nSome Bacillus, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas strains have been shown to \n\ngrow and produce BSF successfully in extreme environmental conditions, with \n\ntemperatures ranging from 55-70 \u00baC, as well as high levels of salinity, from 10-15 % \n\n(23,24). Recently, some Pseudomonas strains originating from floral nectar, a sugar-\n\nrich matrix, were observed to thrive and produce BSF, that further demonstrates the \n\nability of BS-producing microorganisms to inhabit the most unusual microniches (25). \n\nWhile bacterial production of BSFs is already an extensively studied field, there \n\nare still few fungi reported to produce BSFs. Some Candida strains, as well as \n\nAspergillus ustrus, Ustilago maydis and Rhodococcus erythropolis are some of the \n\nfew reported to produce (26\u201329). Table 1 presents some of the most common BSF \n\nproducing microorganisms and their respective BSF. \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Biossurfactants and their producers.

Regulation of biosurfactant production \n\n \n\nThe production of BSF is, to some extent, depending on cell-to-cell \n\ncommunication mediated by chemical signals, a process designated by quorum \n\nsensing (QS). QS is the regulation of gene expression, as a result of changes in the \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\ncell population density and it was first described in the marine Gram negative bacteria \n\nbioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio harveyi (30). Bacteria produce and \n\nrelease chemical molecules, known as autoinducers, that increase in concentration \n\nas the cell population density also increases. When a minimal threshold concentration \n\nof autoinducers is reached, bacterial gene expression is altered and a change in \n\nphenotype occurs. QS communication is known to control some physiological \n\nactivities such as symbiosis, virulence, competence, antibiotic production and biofilm \n\nformation (31). Both Gram positive and gram negative bacteria are capable of QS, \n\nalthough using different systems to do so. Generally, Gram positive bacteria use \n\noligopeptides as autoinducers and gram negative bacteria use acylated homoserine \n\nlactones (32,33) \n\nSome molecules, known as quorum quenchers, are known to interfere in the \n\nQS process and can, therefore, be used to inhibit this intercellular communication \n\nbetween bacteria. An example of this quorum quenching effect, is the synthesis of the \n\npurple pigment violacein in Chromobacterium violaceum that is regulated by QS. As a \n\nresult of the inhibition of QS, the violet phenotype of the colonies is lost (34). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4. Methods for detection and quantification of biosurfactants \n\n \n\nThere are a number of different methodologies to detect and quantify the \n\nproduction of BSF and they can be divided into indirect methods, colorimetric \n\nmethods and molecular methods.  \n\nThe indirect methods rely mostly in the physical properties of the BSFs and \n\nmay or may not be quantitative. \n\n? Drop collapse assay: an easily performed method where a drop of cell \n\nsuspension or surfactant sample is placed on an oil/water surface. The drops \n\ncontaining BSF will collapse, while the BSF free ones will continue to be stable \n\n(35). It is a semi-qualitative method and the diameter of the final drop allows, \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nindirectly, to calculate the BSF concentration. Nevertheless, it can lead to false \n\nnegatives, if the producing strain produces a low amount of BSF (35,36). \n\n? Oil spray method: an expedite assay involving atomized oil, that allows for the \n\ndetection of BSF produced by colonies developing on solid culture medium. \n\nUsing an airbrush, the colonies are sprayed with a fine layer of oil and BSF can \n\nimmediately be detected by the formation of halos around producing colonies. \n\nThis method may be performed on multiple colonies at the same time, and \n\npermits the detection of lower BSF concentrations than the drop collapse \n\nassay (35,37). \n\n? Hemolysis: In a solid medium containing 5% blood, BSF production can be \n\ndetected by the partial or total hemolysis of red blood cells. This hemolytic \n\nactivity is due to the ability of BSF to disrupt the cell membrane (38). However, \n\nthis method is considered unreliable, as hemolysis may be the result of \n\nenzymes, such as lysozyme and, on the other hand, not all biosurfactants \n\ndisplay hemolytic activity (39,40). \n\n? Emulsifcation index: This method is performed by adding hydrocarbons to the \n\nBSF producing bacteria culture. The culture is then centrifuged and laid to rest \n\nfor 24h. If there is presence of BSF, a layer between the hydrocarbon and the \n\nliquid culture will appear. Then, the emulsification index is calculated by \n\ndividing the height of the emulsification layer by the total height (41).  \n\n \n\nColorimetric methods are based on the binding of a dye to the BSF or a specific \n\npart of the BSF molecule. They are specific for different BSF groups. \n\n? CTAB-methylene blue: A test that is mostly used for the detection of \n\nrhamnolipids, it is based on the binding of the rhamnolipids (anionic \n\nsurfactants) to Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide CTAB (cationic surfactant), \n\nin the presence of methylene blue, as a color indicator (42,43). The \n\nappearance of dark halos around in the cultures, in TSA containing CTAB and \n\nmethylene blue, confirms the presence of the BSF and the halos diameter can \n\nbe measured to give a relative concentration of BSF. However, the halos can \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nbe affected by various factors like incubation time, temperature, rhamnolipids \n\nmigration form the cell and the cellular growth phase (44). \n\n? CPC-BTB: This is an innovative highly precise method, that is used to quantify \n\nsurfactin in high production yield cultures (surfactin concentration around 100-\n\n500mg/L). A green complex, formed by CPC (cetilpiridinium chloride), as a \n\nmediator, and BTB (bromotimol blue), as color indicator is used and in the \n\npresence of surfactin, CPC is removed from the CPC-BTB complex, creating a \n\nchromatic shift from light green to dark green and blue. This is due to the free \n\nBTB molecules, after release from the CPC-BTB complex. The optical density \n\nmay also be observed (600 nm) for quantification of BSF (45). \n\n? Orcinol method: This is the standard method to specifically quantify \n\nrhamnolipids. It is based on the extraction of the BSF and consequently acidic \n\nhydrolysis with a orcinol reagent (3-5 dihydroxitoluene and sulfuric acid), in \n\norder to release rhamnose, which is later quantified by spectroscopy (OD 420 \n\nnm) (39,46). \n\n \n\nMolecular methods are usually based on chromatography and spectrometry. \n\nThey allow the quantification, purification and identification of the BSF structure. \n\nAlthough they are highthroughput methods, they present high costs (9,46,47).  \n\nChromatography methods rely on chromatic separation of the BSF and are \n\nusually coupled with mass spectrometry. The most used chromatography in BSF \n\nidentification is the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is the \n\nmost efficient method for BSF identification and quantification (39).  \n\nSpectrometry methods are usually mass spectrometry, that can be used \n\nwithout a previous chromatography (46).  \n\n \n\n1.5. Classification of bacterial surfactants \n\n \n\nBacterial surfactants are classified accordingly to their chemical structure, \n\nmicrobial origin and molecular weight (2,7). Based on their chemical composition, \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nthey are distributed in 4 classes: glycolipids; lipopeptides and lipoproteins, \n\nphospholipids and fatty acids, polymeric and particulate surfactants (2,11,48). \n\nAccording to their molecular weight, they can divided in biosurfactants and \n\nbioemulsifiers. Biosurfactants generally have low molecular weight and are capable of \n\nlowering surface and interfacial tension. Bioemulsifiers refer mainly to high molecular \n\nweight BSFs, and have a major role in the binding and detachment of bacteria to \n\nsurfaces as well as emulsification of hydrocarbons (8,9,49). Biossurfactants are \n\nusually able of emulsification as well. Bioemulsifiers, however, do not typically reduce \n\nsurface and interfacial tension (50). \n\nGlycolipids (rhamnolipids) and lipopeptides (surfactin and liquenisin) are two of \n\nthe most important and well characterized classes of bacterial biossurfantants. \n\nRhamnolipids are BSFs of the glycolipid family. Their production was first described in \n\nP. aeruginosa and they are comprised by one or two molecules of L-rhamnose linked \n\nto one or two monomers of ?-hydroxy fatty acid, as shown in figure 1 (2,10,51). There \n\nare at least 28 rhamnolipid homologues, with four of them (R1, R2, R3 e R4) being \n\nthe most predominant. A typical structure of a mono and di-rhamnolipid can be \n\nobserved in figure 4. The homologues differ mainly in the concentration of rhamnose \n\nmolecules (one or two) and in the length of fatty acid chain (between 8 and 12 \n\ncarbons) (52). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 Structures of a) monorhamnolipid b) di-rhamnolipid adapted from Nguyen et. al (53) \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n\nRhamnolipids play various roles in the physiology of the producing \n\nmicroorganism. Their main functions appear to be the solubilization and the uptake of \n\nhydrocarbons, antimicrobial activity, as to compete with neighboring microorganisms \n\nand mediation in cell attachment and detachment to surfaces (10,20,54). Rhamnolipid \n\nproduction is dependent on quorum sensing signaling and in extreme conditions, \n\nsuch as lack of nutrients, there is an increasing production of rhamnolipid, which can \n\nthen be used as nutrients themselves (55,56). One of the main concerns in the \n\nrhamnolipid production remains the fact that the one of the most prominent \n\nproducers, P. aeruginosa, includes highly pathogenic strains. However, recent studies \n\nhave demonstrated that different Pseudomonas species, such as P. putida and P. \n\nchlororaphis are also able to produce rhamnolipids (20,56). \n\nSurfactin and lichenisin are BSFs from the lipopeptide family and are mainly \n\nproduced by Bacillus species. They are known to interfere in the \n\nattachment/detachment of the microorganism to surfaces, due to their ability to alter \n\nthe hydrophobicity of the bacterial membrane (57,58). Surfactin is a cyclic lipopeptide, \n\ncontaining seven aminoacids linked to a ?-hydroxy fatty acid chain by a lactone \n\nbridge, as shown in figure 4. Surfactin exhibits remarkable surficial activity, and it is \n\ncapable of lowering the water surface tension from 72 to 27 Mn/m in a 20 \u00b5M \n\nconcentration (59,60). There are different surfactin homologues, depending on the \n\nnumber of carbons on the fatty acid chain (13 to 15), as well as on the composition of \n\naminoacids in the peptide sequence. These modifications may alter the BSF activity \n\n(58,61). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 Structure of surfactin. Adapted from Nitschke and Pastore (2002)  \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nLichenisin is a cyclic lipopeptide with seven aminoacids structurally similar to \n\nsurfactin. The main difference between the two BSFs resides in the presence of a \n\nresidue, glutaminyl, instead of a glutamic acid in the first position. This difference \n\nmakes it possible for lichenisin to have a lower CMC and higher surfactant power and \n\nhemolytic activity (62). \n\n \n\n1.6. Applications of biosurfactants and biosurfactant-producing \n\nmicroorganisms \n\n \n\nBSFs have a myriad of applications in various areas, like petroleum recovery, \n\nfood industry, cosmetics, detergents, pharmaceutics and paints (14). Their capability \n\nto emulsify, and dissolve hydrocarbons and oils, makes them a remarkable resource \n\nin bioremediation in oil contaminated areas(16,17,63,64).  \n\nBioremediation relies on the natural capacity of plants and microorganisms to \n\ndegrade contaminants, turning them into less toxic or completely convert them to \n\nnontoxic substances, like water and carbon dioxide (14). A natural and inexpensive \n\nway to increase bioremediation of contamnated areas relies on biostimulation. This \n\nmay be achieved through the increase of nutrients and oxygen. However, it is crucial \n\nto know beforehand the population density as well as the concentration of oil, and the \n\ncorrect pH in order to have a successful bioremediation effect (17,64). Another way to \n\nincrease the bioremediation success is bioaugmentation, in which the concentration \n\nof natural microorganisms inhabiting the contaminated area is increased to accelerate \n\nthe process (14). \n\nBSFs can also be useful in the washing of oil reservoirs and in the microbial \n\nenhanced oil recovery technology (MEOR). The oil residue that is trapped in the small \n\npores of rocks, is thought to represent 50-65% of the oil and it is kept there by \n\nelevated capillary forces and interfacial tension between the oil and the aqueous \n\nphase. MEOR employs microorganisms and their respective BSF to reduce the \n\ninterfacial tension between the rock and oil, allowing the oil to move freely through the \n\nrock pores and reach the surface with ease (64\u201366). \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nDue to their ionic nature, BSF can also perform a major role in the removal of \n\nheavy metals from soil and sediments. Solutions of surfactants can be used for the \n\nsolubilisation and dispersion of the contaminants, and also allow the reuse of the soil \n\n(67). By adding the BSF solution to the soil, the heavy metals are trapped in BSFs \n\nmicelles by electrostatic interactions and are easily retrieved by precipitation or \n\nmembrane separation (14). Recent studies put surfactin, rhamnolipids and \n\nsophorolipids as the most promising candidates to heavy metal removal by BSFs \n\n(68,69). There has also been some recent studies with Candida strains, mainly C. \n\nlipolytica, that demonstrate that the produced BSF can remove up to 96% of Zn and \n\nCu, in groundwater (70). \n\nAlthough it is known that BSFs play a major role in the development and \n\nsustainability of biofilms, it has recently come to light that they may be important in \n\nthe disruption of already established ones (3). A biofilm is a community of \n\nmicroorganisms that adhere to a solid or fluid interface. They are usually organized in \n\nmicrocolonies and surrounded by a self-produced matrix of water and polymeric \n\nsubstances (71). They present a severe problem in healthcare contexts, as they are \n\nrelated to pathogenic and chronic diseases, in the food industry, by attaching to \n\nequipment and work surfaces, as well as the environment, by triggering biocorrosion \n\n(72\u201374). The emulsifying properties of BSFs give them an advantage in the control of \n\nbiofilms. However, this efficiency is dependent on a number of conditionings such as \n\nthe composition of the medium, temperature, BSF concentration and time of exposure \n\n(5). An example of this biofilm-control effect has been demonstrated in the lipopeptide \n\nputisolvin, produced by Pseudomonas putida, that was able to arrest the growth of \n\nbiofilms in other Pseudomonas strains (75). Another interesting example was shown \n\nwhen cirugic catheters were covered in surfactin solution and later inoculated with cell \n\nbacterial suspensions. The catheters with surfactin exhibited lower level of \n\ncolonization by Salmonella, E.coli and Proteus mirabilis (48). \n\nBSFs possess antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties, having been \n\nsuggested as alternative antibiotics and antimicrobials (49). They have been reported \n\nto inhibit bacterial growth, stimulating the immune system of the host, and even \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\ncapable of cell lysis since their structure allows them to affect the permeability of the \n\ncell membrane with the same properties as a detergent (48). However, real BSF \n\napplications on pharmaceutics and health areas is still limited (76). Surfactin has \n\nproved to be one of the most resourceful and useful biosurfactants in this area. It has \n\nthe ability to inhibit coagulation processes and even forming ionic channels within the \n\nmembrane, as well as reducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells (49). Surfactin also \n\ndisplays effective antiviral activity, being able to inactivate herpes virus, retrovirus and \n\nsome other RNA and DNA viruses (14). Iturin, another lipopetide produced by B. \n\nsubtilis exhibits remarkable antifungal activity and is known to alter both morphology \n\nand structure of cell membranes in yeasts. Daptomicyn, a lipopeptide produced by \n\nStreptomyces roseosporus was incorporated in a commercial antibiotic, as a drug \n\nnamed cubicin. It is used in the treatment of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus \n\naureus and other Gram positive bacteria (77,78). In the glycolipids family, it has been \n\ndemonstrated that some rhamnolipids, produced by P. aeruginosa cultures, exhibit \n\nhigh antifungal activity against some fungi strains (79). \n\nBSFs can also have an important role in the food industry. Emulsification is a \n\nmajor determinant of the consistency and texture of foods (80,81). The stability of the \n\nemulsification complex can be improved by addition of a BSF to the system. \n\nProcessed foods, like butter and mayonnaise, are some examples of emulsions. A \n\nrecent study has proved the utility of a BSF produced by Candida utilis in the \n\nformulation of mayonnaise, used as a salad dressing (82), while some rhamnolipids \n\nare used to enhance the properties of frozen desserts and butter (83).  \n\n \n\n1.7. Co-cultivation as a tool to enhance BSF production \n\n \n\nIn order to increase the yield of BSF production, and, therefore minimize its \n\nproduction costs in an industrial scale, there has been a search for new ways to \n\ncultivate BSF-producing microorganisms (8). The search for BSF producing bacteria \n\nable to do so under extreme conditions or in uncommon habitats is a recent and still \n\nlimited field, but it has shown great promise. Darvish et al (24) reported the discovery \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nof microbial consortium of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas in extreme \n\nconditions of temperature and pH. Some Pseudomonas strains are able to grow from \n\norchids and forest herb floral nectar (84). A strain of Bacillus licheniformis was \n\nobserved to growth in anaerobic conditions and producing a BSF capable of reducing \n\nsurface tension to 28 m N/m (25). \n\nAnother strategy to minimize the BSF production costs is the cultivation in low-\n\ncost and raw materials, like industrial waste and vegetable oil (6). There has been a \n\nnumber of waste products that have been used in the cultivation of BSF producing \n\nbacteria, such as oily effluents, animal and vegetable fat, whey, corn, glycerol, \n\nethanol, soapstock, etc (14). Recent studies in molecular biology of microorganisms \n\nhave reported that often some microbial compounds are not produced under \n\nlaboratory conditions, but rather remain unexpressed, resulting in only a fraction of \n\nthe microbial compounds potential being obtained (85,86). \n\nA study by Mearns-Spragg (87) showed an increase in the production of \n\nantimicrobial compounds in marine bacteria when cultured with terrestrial bacterial \n\nstrains, such as S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Co-cultivation, then, appears as \n\nan emerging strategy to induce the expression of secondary metabolites. This \n\napproach attempts to recreate the natural environment of the complex microbial \n\ncommunities, where they establish biotic relations. The competition for nutrients and \n\nantagonism are examples of situations that may trigger the production of secondary \n\nmetabolites, such as BSF (85,86).  \n\nA study by Kanagasabhapathy and Nagata (88) reported that four antibiotic \n\nproducing bacteria isolated from the marine sponge Pseudoceratina purpurea \n\nincreased their antimicrobial activity when exposed to two strains of human \n\npathogenic bacteria. In 2011, Dusane et. al (85) showed that there was an increase in \n\nBSF production between bacteria and fungi, when co-cultured together. It also \n\nshowed an increase of antimicrobial activity in Bacillus strains, especially when co-\n\ncultivated with P. aeruginosa and B. pumilis, both biofilm forming strains. \n\nThis cultivation strategy can be performed on either solid or liquid media, and \n\nhas shown promising results, although much remains to be studied (89). \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n1.8.  Objectives \n\n \n\nThe aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that co-cultivation of BSF the \n\nproducing strains, B. licheniformis and Pseudomonas sp., with biofilm forming strains, \n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria innocua, could stimulate the production of \n\nsurfactin and rhamnolipids, respectively. The tensioactive effect was tested by four \n\nmethods: the oil spray test, the drop collapse assay and cultivation in blood agar. \n\nQuantification of BSFs was performed by cultivation in CTAB-methylene blue \n\nmedium; the CPC-BTB method, and the specific quantification of rhamnolipids was \n\nconducted by the orcinol method. Quorum sensing inhibition effect of cultures and co-\n\ncultures in Chromobacterium violaceum was also assessed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMethods \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n2. Methods \n\n \n\n2.1. Bacterial cultures and culture media \n\n \n\nAs BSF-producing strains, Bacillus licheniformis, a surfactin producer isolated \n\nin volcano sediments of the Cadis golf, provided by Ant\u00f3nio Louvado (personal \n\ncontact) and Pseudomonas #74, a rhamnolipid producer, isolated in Aveiro Ria by \n\nPatr\u00edcia Domingues, (90), were used. As inducing strains (pathogenic/biofilm forming) \n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC\u00ae 27853 and Listeria innocua were used. L. innocua \n\nwas obtained from Escola Superior de Biotecnologia (Universidade Cat\u00f3lica \n\nPortuguesa, Portugal). Listeria innocua is a gram positive bacteria, that forms biofilms \n\nand although non pathogenic, it is genetically close to the food pathogen Listeria \n\nmonocytogenes (91,92). P. aeruginosa is a gram-negative, biofilm forming bacteria, \n\nthat is highly pathogenic. It can grow within a wide range of environmental \n\ncondtitiond, although optimmaly at 37\u00b0C and in aerobic conditions (93). \n\nAll cultures were stored at -80\u00b0C, with glycerol as a crio-protector. In order to \n\nobtain active cultures, the frozen culture was inoculated in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB,  \n\nLiofilchem) and incubated at 37\u00b0C, with agitation (150 rpm) for 24h. The cultures were \n\nsuccessively re-inoculated and incubated in the same conditions. Plate streakings \n\nwere also performed in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Liofilchem) between every liquid re-\n\ninoculation, in order to confirm the purity of the cultures. The plates were incubated at \n\n37\u00b0C for 24 h and stored at 4 \u00baC.  \n\nFor the experiments of cultivation and co-cultivation fresh cultures of B. \n\nlicheniformis and Pseudomonas #74 were transferred from TSB to optimized media, \n\nby co-inoculating 1ml of the producing strain with 100 \u00b5l of either of the inducing \n\nstrains (85). The B. licheniformis axenic culture and the co-cultures B. licheniformis + \n\nListeria innocua and B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa were cultured in Luria Bertani \n\nmedium (LB, Liofilchem). The Pseudomonas axenic culture and and the co-cultures \n\n(Pseudomonas + Listeria innocua and Pseudomonas + P. aeruginosa) were \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\ncultivated in minimal salt medium, adapted from Rikalovic et. al (54), with 1.07 g/L \n\nNH4CL, 1.49 g/L KCL, 14.54 g/L TrisHCL, 0.2 g/L MgS04, 10 g/L triptone and 0.7 ml/L \n\nolive oil.  \n\nThe incubation time corresponding to early stationary phase was determined \n\nand used in the experiments of biosurfactant production. \n\n \n\n2.2. Growth time of cultures and co-cultures \n\n \n\nIn order to monitor and determine the optimal time for the production of \n\nbiosurfactants (late exponential phase, early stationary phase), growth curves of \n\nevery axenic culture and co-cultures were constructed using the media described \n\nabove. The cultures were incubated a 37\u00b0C, with agitation (120 rpm), for 10 h. During \n\nthe incubation period, aliquots were collected hourly to determine the optical density \n\n(OD 600 nm) of the cultures, using non-inoculated media as blanks. 3 independent \n\nassays, with 1 replica each were conducted. \n\n \n\n2.3. Quantification and detection of biosurfactants \n\n \n\nThe presence and activity of biosurfactants in early stationary phase cultures \n\nand co-cultures was evaluated by six different methods. Escherichia coli DH5? was \n\nused as a negative control. The chemical surfactants Tween 80 (12 mM), CTAB (0.2 \n\nmM) and SDS (5%) were used as positive controls. \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Oil spray  \n\n \n\nThe oil spray method was conducted as described by Burch et. al (2010) (37). \n\nUsing a needle, TSA plates were inoculated with axenic and co-cultures and \n\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Paraffin oil was sprayed (Merck) on the surface of the \n\nTSA plates using an airbrush (Thomas 50 Hz) and the formation of halos surrounding \n\nthe producing colonies were the interpreted as an indication of BSF production.  \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nEach assay had 3 replicas, in a total of 3 independent assays. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Drop collapse assay \n\n \n\nFor a quantitative analysis, an adapted method of drop collapse assay from \n\nBodour and Miller-Maier, 1998 (94) was performed on axenic cultures and co-cultures \n\ncell free extracts (CFE). The CFEs were obtained by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 3 min) \n\n(Themo scientific, motor radius: 8 cm) and filtration with a serynge and filtration \n\nmembrane (Frilabo, 0.22 \u00b5m) \n\nA drop of destilled water (5 \u00b5l) was placed on a plastic petri dish, previously \n\ncleaned with distilled water and ethanol (97%). Using a micropipette, 1 \u00b5l of sample or \n\ncontrols (SDS 5% and CTAB 0.2 mM as positive controls, water as negative control) \n\nwere then placed at the center of the water drop. The drop was left to rest for 1 \n\nminute and later examined using a magnifying glass (Olympus cover-015) and the \n\ndiameter was measured. If the drop collapsed after BSF addition, in comparison with \n\nthe negative control, the results was interpreted as positive (94).  \n\n4 independent assays, with 5 replicas each, were conducted. \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Bood agar hemolysis \n\n \n\nBlood Agar plates (Merck) were inoculated with axenic cultures and co-cultures \n\nand incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h.The presence of grey halos, considered as ?-\n\nhemolysis (or partial hemolysis), or transparent halos, interpreted as ?-hemolysis (or \n\ntotal hemolysis) around the colonies confirmed both the presence and activity of the \n\nBSF. The absence of halos was considered ??-hemolysis (lack of hemolysis) (95). \n\n3 independent assays were conducted, with 1 replica of each test. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n2.3.4. CTAB-methylene blue agar \n\n \n\nPlates containing the CTAB-methylene blue medium (0.2 g/L CTAB Sigma \n\nAldrich, 0.005 g/L methylene blue; 15 g/L agar Liofilchem, 1.38 g/L Triptone Oxoid, \n\n4g/L MgSO4.7H20 Applichem, 1 g/L Na2HPO4.2H2O Applichem; 0.005 g/L \n\nCaCl2.2H2O, 25 ml/L glycerol Sigma Aldrich (96) were inoculated with axenic and co-\n\ncultures. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h (44) and subsequently stored in \n\nthe refrigerator at 4\u00b0C for 7 days (97). The presence of dark blue halos was \n\nconsidered a positive result for the presence and activity of anionic BSF.  \n\n \n\n2.3.5. CPC-BTB  \n\n \n\nFor this colorimetric assay, an adapted method from Yang et. al, 2015 (45) \n\nwas used. Cetilpiridinium chloride (CPC) (Sigma Aldrich) and bromotimol blue (BTB) \n\n(Alfa Aesar) were dissolved separately in 0.1M PBS (NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 8.0) to \n\nobtain 0.2 mM solutions. Subsequently, 20 mL of each solution were mixed together \n\nin order to obtain a green reagent. 800 \u00b5l of the reagent was added to 100\u00b5l of the \n\nCFE of axenic cultures and co-cultures (previously incubated in optimized medium for \n\n24h) and left to rest for 5 minutes, at room temperature. The chromatic shift from \n\ngreen to blue, created by addition of the reagent to the cultures, confirmed the \n\npresence and activity of BSFs. The absorbance was read at 590 nm. For each \n\nindividual test, a standard curve was prepared, using SDS solutions with the \n\nconcentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 mg/L (45). \n\n3 independent assays, with 3 replicas each, were conducted. \n\n \n\n2.3.6. Orcinol method \n\n \n\nFor specific detection and quantification of rhamnolipids, the colorimetric \n\norcinol method adapted from Tahzibi et al., 2003 (98) was used. The orcinol reagent \n\nwas prepared by mixing 0.19 g of orcinol (3-5 dihydroxitoluene, Sigma Aldrich) with \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n54.6 mL of sulfuric acid (97%) (Merck) and adding distilled water until final volume of \n\n100 ml. For each independent assay, a calibration curve using different rhamnose \n\nconcentrations (0mg/L (blank); 1.563 mg/L; 3,125 mg/L; 6.25 mg/L; 12.5 mg/L; \n\n25mg/L; 50 mg/L) was constructed. The CFEs were obtained by centrifugation (6000 \n\nrpm, 3min) (Thermo Scientifc; motor radius: 8 cm) and filtration membrane (Frilabo, \n\n0.22\u00b5m) \n\nFor the determination of BSF in the CFE, 100\u00b5l of CFE was added to 900 \u00b5l of \n\norcinol reagent, in 2 ml microtubes. The samples were heated up to 100\u00b0C for 20 \n\nmin., in a heating plate, and later cooled down to room temperature. The optical \n\ndensity at 421 nm was measured (96).  \n\n \n\n2.3.7. Quorum sensing Inhibition \n\n \n\nThe method for evaluating quorum sensing inhibition was adapted from \n\nMcLean et al., 2004 (99). Axenic cultures and co-cultures were inoculated in LB agar \n\nplates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The indicator strain, Chromobacterium \n\nviolaceum , was grown in LB broth, overnight at 30\u00b0C. Aliquots of 5\u00b5l of C. violaceum \n\nculture were mixed with 5 mL of LB soft agar (5%), previously heated and cooled to \n\n45\u00b0C. The test plates were covered with the overlay of inoculated LB soft agar and \n\nincubated overnight at 30\u00b0C. Garlic slices were used as positive controls (100) and a \n\ncolony of C. violaceum was used as negative control.

Axenic cultures and co-cultures of each of the BSF \n\nproducing strains reached similar maximum optical density at stationary phase (0.2 \n\nnm for Pseudomonas #74 cultures and 0.21 nm B. licheniformis). This is in \n\naccordance with existing literature that does not present significant differences \n\nbetween axenic and co-cultures growth curves (101) \n\nSince BSF are considered secondary metabolites, produced in the stationary \n\nphase, for the following tasks a period of incubation of 48 h was established. after \n\nstationary phase proceeds, BSF are released to the medium but they can be later \n\nincorporated and used as carbon sources, as other substrates in the medium become \n\nexhausted (8) \n\n \n\n3.2.

The appearance of halos is due to the \n\ntensioactive reaction of the BSF with the paraffin oil (35). The diameter of the \n\nproduced halo is directly correlated with the concentration and activity of BSFs \n\n(35,37). \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Semi-quantification of the halos produced by axenic cultures and co-cultures (P- \n\nPseudomonas #74; P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa; P+L Pseudomonas #74 + L. \n\ninnocua ; B \u2013 B. licheniformis; B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; B+L \u2013 B. licheniformis \n\n+ L. innocua) in the oil spray assay.

This results were \n\nfurther classified qualitatively as weakly positive (+; diameter&lt;1 cm), positive (++; \n\ndiameter ? 1 cm) or negative (-; no halo). As expected, halos were formed around all \n\nthe axenic cultures and co-cultures and the positive control (CTAB 0.2mM) which is in \n\naccordance with literature (37,102). \n\nThe halos of the Pseudomonas cultures P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74, P+P \u2013 \n\nPseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa, and P+L \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua were \n\nsignificantly larger than the B \u2013 B. licheniformis; B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. \n\naeruginosa; B+L \u2013 B. licheniformis + L. innocua cultures, with Pseudomonas cultures \n\ndisplaying an average diameter of 2.33 cm and Bacillus cultures an average of 0.62 \n\ncm.The surfactin CMC is estimated to be 9.4 \u00d7 10?6 M (~9.7 mg/L) (103) and the \n\nrhamnolipid CMC is estimated to be 18 x 10-6 M.This could mean that, even though \n\nrhamnolipid displays less tensioactive ability than surfactin, it is liberated to the \n\nmedium in higher quantities and produces bigger halos diameters. However, the \n\ndiameter of the halos produced by co-cultures was not significantly different from \n\nthose produced by the axenic cultures of the producer species (ANOVA, p>0.05). \n\nConsidering that this method in an expedite tool for the screening of BSF producing \n\nstrains but it suffers from low accuracy, in comparison to other quantitative methods \n\n(104) the results may interpreted as an indication that co-cultivation did not induce a \n\nchange in BSF production in either of the producing bacterial species or that shifts in \n\nproductivity were too subtle to be detected by the diameter of the halos. This assay \n\ndoes, however, display some major advantages in relation to some more accurate \n\nmethods, such as the drop collapse assay because it detects low concentrations of \n\nBSF, making it possible to identify some BSF producing strains that would not be \n\noverlooked if tested by other methods (35,37). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n3.3. Drop collapse assay \n\n \n\nWhen a drop of water is applied to a hydrophobic surface, it will form a bead, due \n\nto the polar water molecules that are repelled from the surface. However, if the \n\ndroplet contains a surfactant, the interfacial tension between drop and surface is \n\nreduced, which results in the collapse and spreading of the water drop (94). This is \n\nthe principle of the drop collapse assay that is performed on an oil/water droplet, \n\nwhere a small amount of cell suspension or surfactant sample is placed at the center. \n\nIf the cell suspension contains BSF, the water/oil droplet will collapse and spread \n\n(94,105).  \n\nAfter placing a water drop at the center of petri dish, samples (1 \u00b5L) of water, \n\nCTAB (0.2 mM) and SDS (5%) and axenic and co-cultures (P- Pseudomonas #74; \n\nP+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa; P+L Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua ; B \u2013 \n\nB. licheniformis; B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; B+L \u2013 B. licheniformis + L. \n\ninnocua) were added to the water droplet. Positive results were obtained for the \n\npositive controls (SDS 5% and CTAB 0.2mM) as well as for all the axenic cultures \n\nand co-cultures (fig. 7).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

Distilled water was used as a negative control. CTAB (0.2 mM) and SDS (5%) were \nused as positive controls. The values are presented mm. The bars represent the standard \ndeviation. \n\nAs expected, drops with CFE of axenic and co-cultures presented a \n\nsignificantly larger diameter than drops with negative control, water, as is \n\nextensively reported in literature (94,106\u2013109) Positive controls, SDS (5%) and \n\nCTAB (0.2 mM) presented the largest diameters. \n\nExperimental conditions P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74, P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + \n\nP. aeruginosa and P+L \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua presented medium \n\ndiameter values of 9.4 mm, 8.9 mm and 9.4 mm, respectively. B \u2013 B. licheniformis, \n\nB+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa and B+L \u2013 B. licheniformis + L. innocua \n\ndisplayed medium diameters of 9.5 mm, 9.4 mm and 9.5 mm, respectively. SDS \n\n(5%) and CTAB (0.2 mM) increased the diameter of the water drops to medium \n\nvalues of 11.3 mm and 12.0 mm, respectively. Differences between the results \n\ncorresponding to axenic cultures and co-cultures were not significant (ANOVA \n\np>0.05), which means there is no influence in the tensioactive effect of the BSF \n\nwhen its producing strains are co-cultured with the biofilm forming strains. In 2011, \n\nDusane et al, described a positive result, in which the zone diameter of the drop \n\ncollapse assay performed on CFE of B. pumilus co-cultured with P.aeruginosa \n\nand B. licheniformis co-cultured with B. pumilus increased significantly (85). This \n\nindicates that the outcome of the production efficiency is highly dependent on the \n\nproducing strain but also on the inducer strain elected for co-cultivation. \n\nThe cultures and co-cultures also exhibit a lower tensioactive effect that the \n\ncommercialized surfactants, which might be related to the low sensitivity of this \n\nmethod, as a significant concentration of the BSF has to be present in order to \n\ncause a bigger collapse of the drop (110).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n3.4. Blood agar hemolysis \n\n \n\nAgar plates supplemented with 5% blood were used to detect BSF production \n\nthrough the appearance of transparent or yellow/green halos around colonies, \n\ncorresponding to hemolysis of red blood cells by the BSF produced (96).  \n\nSDS (5%) was used as positive control and presents ?-hemolysis (total hemolysis) \n\nand E.coli SH5? was used as negative control, as shown in fig. 6. The plates \n\ninoculated with P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74, P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa \n\nand P+L \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua cultures showed yellow/green halos (fig. \n\n6) indicating the occurrence of partial hemolysis (?-hemolysis) and oxidation of \n\nhemoglobin. B. licheniformis axenic cultures and co-cultures, B \u2013 B. licheniformis, \n\nB+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa and B+L \u2013 B. licheniformis + L. innocua, did \n\nnot display hemolytic activity, as seen in fig 8.  \n\n \n\n         \n\nFigure 8.

It is important to refer that, this \n\nmethod is performed on a very specific medium that is not the optimal medium \n\ndetermined for the axenic and co-cultures, and it\u2019s difficult to determine if the \n\nproductivity would be different in other mediums (44) \n\nA B C \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nTable 3- Results of the blood agar hemolysis assay on axenic and co-cultures (P- \n\nPseudomonas #74; P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa; P+L Pseudomonas #74 + L. \n\ninnocua ; B \u2013 B. licheniformis; B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; B+L \u2013 B. licheniformis \n\n+ L. innocua).

However, due to the multiple factors \n\nthat may originate hemolysis, this assay is considered neither reliable nor accurate as \n\nthe sole approach to BSF as it may deliver false positive or false negative results \n\n(112) and it should always be interpreted in the light of other sources of evidence. \n\nAlthough the B. licheniformis cultures did not exhibit hemolysis, that does not mean \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nsurfactin was not produced. To detect the surfactin produced by Bacillus strains, \n\nmethods based in cell suspensions are more usually applied (113,114), as \n\nconcentrations tend to build up in suspensions where hemolytic activity is more likely \n\nto be detected (112).  \n\n \n\n3.5. CTAB-methylene blue agar \n\n \n\nThis is a specific test based on the appearance of dark blue halos due to the \n\nbinding of anionic surfactants to CTAB (cationic surfactant), in the presence of \n\nmethylene blue (42,43,96). This method is mainly used for the detection and \n\nquantification of rhamnolipids, but it was also used here for detection of surfactin \n\nproduction, as it is also an anionic surfactant. The diameter of the halo is dependent \n\non the concentration of the BSF which makes it possible to interpret the results on a \n\nsemi-quantitative way (44). The production of BSF was classified as weakly positive \n\n(+, diameter &lt;5 mm), positive (++,  diameter ? 5 mm) or negative (-, no halo).  \n\nAfter a 48h incubation period, only the cultures containing the inducer strain P. \n\naeruginosa (P+P, B+P) displayed positive results (Table 3). However, when the \n\nplates were refrigerated for 72 hours more, all the axenic cultures and co-cultures (P- \n\nPseudomonas #74; P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa; P+L Pseudomonas \n\n#74 + L. innocua ; B \u2013 B. licheniformis; B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; B+L \u2013 \n\nB. licheniformis + L. innocua), except for the B. licheniformis axenic culture, \n\ndeveloped dark blue halos considered to be positive results. The low temperatures \n\nenhance the precipitation of the dye and intensify the color of the halos that were \n\nundistinguishable immediately after the incubation (43).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nTable 4.

When the axenic cultures were co-cultured with the \n\ninducing strain, P. aeruginosa, their halo diameter increased from 4,7mm to 11,7mm \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n(P<P+P) and from 0mm to 12,7mm. This method is more rigorous and reliable than \n\nthe oil spray and blood agar test, as it considers only the anionic properties of the \n\nBSF, and other metabolites do not interfere(98). \n\nOne possible explanation to the fact that the co-cultures with P. aeruginosa \n\ndisplayed a significant increase over axenic and co-culture with L. innocua may be \n\ndue to the fact that P. aeruginosa was acting not only as inducing, biofilm forming \n\nstrain but also as a rhamnolipids producing strain. P. aeruginosa is one of the most \n\nprominent rhamnolipids producer, and it is well described in literature that \n\nrhamnolipids from P. aeruginosa produce positive results in this method.(56,96,115) It \n\nis also to be noted that this method, contrary to the oil spray and the blood agar \n\nmethod, used the minimal salt medium (supplemented with CTAB and methylene \n\nblue) considered optimal for the Pseudomonas culture, which could have helped \n\nincrease BSF production. To further investigate the P. aeruginosa role in these \n\nresults, cultivation in CTAB-methylene blue agar of an axenic culture of P. aeruginosa \n\nshould be performed. \n\nThe cultures P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74, P+L \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua and \n\nB+L \u2013 B. licheniformis + L. innocua showed positive results for the production of \n\nanionic BSF production, which is in accordance with the literature (43,115). B \n\nlicheniformis was the only culture in which BSF production could not be detected by \n\nthis method. A similar result was obtained by Lin et. al, 1998, in which this screening \n\nmethod did not work for a B. subtilis strain, because its growth was inhibited by \n\nCTAB. CTAB has been shown to inhibit some bacteria activity, by binding to cell \n\nsubstrate and inhibiting bacteria to adhere to substrates(44,116,117). \n\nAccording to the results of the CTAB-methylene blue assay, co-cultivation with \n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa showed a clear increase in the concentration of BSF \n\nmolecules in the cultures.. The best combination for the co-cultivation of \n\nPseudomonas #74 was P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa and the best co-\n\nculture for Bacillus licheniformis was B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa. \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nA\n\n \n\nB\n\n \n\nC\n\n \n\nFigure 9.

CPC-BTB method \n\n \n\nThis method allows a qualitative detection and quantitative analysis of anionic \n\nsurfactants and it is based on the formation of a complex between BTB-bromotimol \n\nblue, (negative charge), a color indicator, and CPC-cetylpiridinium chloride (positive \n\ncharge), a mediator. BTB displays a blue color (pH 8), but when CPC is added, a \n\ngreen complex is formed. Adding BSF will bind to CPC, freeing the BTB that goes \n\nback to displaying the blue color (45).  \n\nThis chromatic shift is a qualitative result of the BSF production and by reading \n\nthe optical density a quantitative result of BSF activity can be determined (45). For \n\neach assay, a calibration curve was constructed with different SDS concentrations. \n\nThe BSF concentration was estimated as SDS equivalents and the results are \n\npresented in table 5.  \n\nAll the cultures showed BSF production, with the exception of axenic culture of \n\nPseudomonas #74. The values obtained range from 6 mg/L in the axenic culture of B. \n\nlicheniformis, to 41 mg/L in the co-culture of Pseudomonas #74 with L. innocua. \n\nThere was an enhancement of BSF production in co-cultures, in relation to axenic \n\ncultures (B \u2013 B. licheniformis&lt;B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa&lt;B+L \u2013 B. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nlicheniformis + L. innocua and P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74&lt;P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. \n\naeruginosa&lt;P+L \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua). \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

The values are within \n\nthe range reported in literature for different Bacillus strains (45,118). However, these \n\nvalues should be interpreted in a comparative context, as they are expressed in SDS \n\nequivalents, and not in surfactin or rhamnolipid concentrations. SDS displays a \n\nchromatic shift to blue around 300 mg/L and surfactin only at 600 mg/L (45). This \n\nmight mean that SDS has a higher binding power to CPC, and the values estimated \n\nhere may represent an underestimation. Rhamnolipid and surfactin standards must \n\nbe used in future to obtain exact concentration estimates in the samples. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nB B+L B+P P P+L P+PB\nS\n\nF\n c\n\no\nn\n\nce\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n in\n\n S\nD\n\nS\n q\n\nu\niv\n\na\nle\n\nn\nts\n\n \n(m\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\nConcentration of biosurfactant (CPC-BTB assay)\n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n3.7. Orcinol method \n\n \n\nThe orcinol method is the most widely used for the quantification of \n\nrhamnolipids. The rhamnose groups in the rhamnolipids react with the orcinol \n\nreagent and produce different colours, depending on rhamnolipid concentration \n\n(Chandrasekaran and BeMiller 1980; Koch et al. 1991). For each assay a \n\nstandard curve is prepared with rhamnose, for quantification, but a correction \n\nfactor has to be taken into account, in order to compensate the extra mass in the \n\nlipid portion of the rhamnolipids  (119). D\u00e9ziel et al (46) proposed a correction \n\nfactor of 2.25. One problem with this approach is that the results will vary with the \n\nproportion of mono- to di-RLs in the culture to be analyzed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11. Rhamnolipid concentration by the orcinol assay. Results are expressed in rhamnose \nequivalents (mg/L). The bars represent the deviations. \n\n \n\nAs expected, there was production of rhamnolipids by the Pseudomonas \n\ncultures, detected by the orcinol method, as it is extensively reported in literature \n\n(20,115,120,121).  \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nP P+L P+P\n\nR\nh\n\na\nm\n\nn\no\n\nli\np\n\nid\n c\n\no\nn\n\nce\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n in\n\n r\nh\n\na\nm\n\nn\no\n\nse\n \n\ne\nq\n\nu\niv\n\na\nle\n\nn\nts\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nRhamnolipid concentration (orcinol method)\n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n The average rhamnolipid concentration was 33.9 mg/L for axenic cultures of \n\nPseudomonas, 25.3 mg/L for P+L \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua and 44.9 mg/L \n\nfor P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa. Differences between the rhamnolipid \n\nconcentrations in axenic cultures and co-cultures were not significant (ANOVA > \n\n0.05).  \n\n \n\n3.8. Quorum-sensing inhibition \n\n \n\nThe main role of quorum-sensing is thought to be the control of bacterial \n\npopulation density. In habitats where bacterial populations compete for resources or \n\nin cases where bacteria infect a determined host, the ability to interfere with this \n\nbacterial cell-cell communication is both an advantage and a defense mechanism. \n\nThis process is known as quorum-quenching (30,33) \n\nIn this qualitative assay, the effect of axenic cultures and co-cultures (P- \n\nPseudomonas #74; P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa; P+L Pseudomonas \n\n#74 + L. innocua ; B \u2013 B. licheniformis; B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; B+L \u2013 \n\nB. licheniformis + L. innocua) was tested on the inhibition of the quorum sensing \n\nmechanism of Chromobacterium violaceum. A positive result of quorum-quenching \n\nwas interpreted as a depigmentation around the C. violaceum culture and \n\ncorresponds to the inhibition of the production of the purple pigmentation, the results \n\nare summarized in Table 5. \n\nPositive results corresponding to a quorum quenching effect were obtained for \n\nP \u2013 Pseudomonas #74, P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa, P+L \u2013 \n\nPseudomonas #74 + L. innocua, as seen in figure 13. However, it is not possible, \n\nthrough this method to conclude if these positive results were due to the co-cultivation \n\nor even due to the BSFs present in the cultures, as these results may be caused by \n\nother molecular mechanisms. Existing literature has shown that C. violaceum \n\nregulates his pigmentation production by the N-hexanoyl HSL (C6-HSL), a AHL auto-\n\ninducer (30,32), while some studies have shown that Pseudomonas strains use two \n\nsignal molecules, 3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactione (3-oxo-C12 HSL) and N-\n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nbutanoyl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) as their inducers. These molecules will \n\ncompetitively bind and, subsequently, inhibit the receptor for the cognate signal C6-\n\nHSL C. violaceum, readily inhibiting its QS process (32). It is possible that this \n\ninhibition effect could be caused by Pseudomonas metabolites other than AHLs. A \n\nmutated strain of P. aeruginosa incapable of producing both 3-oxo-dodecanoyl \n\nhomoserine lactione (3-oxo-C12 HSL) and N-butanoyl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), \n\nretained significant QS inhibition activity, suggesting this activity to be regulated by \n\nother QS products (99) namely BSFs. In general, although a quorum sensing \n\ninhibition effect was demonstrated in Pseudomonas #74 cultures and co-cultures, the \n\neffect cannot be unequivocally related to the BSF, as other secondary metabolites \n\nmay be involved.  \n\n \n\nTable 5 - Qualitative results of the quorum sensing inhibition assay in axenic cultures and co-\n\ncultures (P- Pseudomonas #74; P+P \u2013 Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa; P+L \n\nPseudomonas #74 + L. innocua ; B \u2013 B. licheniformis; B+P \u2013 B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; \n\nB+L \u2013 B. licheniformis + L. innocua).

This might be due to \n\nthe fact that each method analyses different properties of the BSFs. Oil spray, for \n\nexample, is only used for BSF detection. CTAB-methylene blue relies on the anionic \n\nproperties of the BSF. Blood agar hemolysis analyses the haemolytic properties of \n\nthe BSF. The orcinol method is used for rhamnolipid concentration assessment and \n\nthe drop collapse assay is an indicator of the BSF tensioactive activity that depends \n\non the size and ramification level of the lipid(122,123). \n\nA more detailed chemical characterization of the BSF present in the extracts \n\nwould be necessary for a better understanding of the results and of the mechanisms \n\nof biological interaction between the producer and inducer strains \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nEven so, it is clear, through the CTAB-methylene blue agar and CPC-BTB \n\nassays the most intense reactions were displayed by the co-cultures of the producing \n\nbacteria. \n\n  \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConclusion \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nIn conclusion, the CPC-BTB method and the CTAB-methylene blue test showed a \n\nclear increase in the concentration of BSF molecules produced which sustains the \n\nhypothesis that co-cultivation of BSF-producer strains with inducers strains may \n\ncause a shift the production of BSFs. However, the oil spray, blood hemolysis, drop \n\ncollapse and orcinol methods did not show significant differences between axenic \n\ncultures and co-cultures. Different methods describe different properties of the BSF \n\n(e.g. tenso-active effect, concentration) and they must be interpreted as a whole. \n\nHowever, considering that BSF are most often released as mixtures of molecules, it is \n\nimperative to obtain information on the chemical characterization of the BSF pool \n\nproduced in each experimental condition so that the effect of the interaction between \n\nproducers and inducers can be understood at the molecular level and key for further \n\nbiotechnological applications are provided. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n4.
