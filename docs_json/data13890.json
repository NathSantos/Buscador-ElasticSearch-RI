The topographical distribution and the differences in the grain size of the sedi-\nments that compose the point bars of the river, originated from the multiple sedimentary pro-\ncesses, and make possible the creation and separation of different nesting environments. Each\nturtle species takes advantage of the place that presents physiographic characteristics appropri-\nate to the hatching success of their eggs. The superposition of the P. expansa and P. unifilis nest\nplacement areas is rare. The P. expansa nests are concentrated on the central portion of the beaches\nwhere successive depositional sedimentary events produced sandy banks more than 3.3 m above\nthe river water level. The P. unifilis nests are distributed preferentially in the upstream and down-\nstream portions along the point bars where the sandy deposits rarely surpass 1.5 m at the moment\nof laying. P. expansa nests located on the beaches of fine to medium sized sand hatch in a mean\nof 68 days, while those incubated on beaches of medium to coarse sand size take a mean of 54\ndays to hatch.\nKey-words: Podocnemis, turtle, sediment, nesting place, incubation duration\n\nControle geol\u00f3gico das \u00e1reas de nidifica\u00e7\u00e3o de Podocnemis expansa\ne Podocnemis unifilis no Rio Java\u00e9s, Ilha do Bananal, Brasil\n\nRESUMO - A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das covas de Podocnemis expansa (tartaruga-da-amaz\u00f4nia) e Podocnemis\nunifilis (tracaj\u00e1) ao longo das barras em pontal do rio Java\u00e9s na Ilha do Bananal, mostra uma clara\nprefer\u00eancia destes quel\u00f4nios por ambientes geol\u00f3gicos diferenciados, seja em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 morfologia,\nconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o granulom\u00e9trica ou altura das covas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel do rio.

These species belong\nto the Pelomedusidae family, which has five\nspecies distributed throughout the northern and\ncentral western regions in Brazil (Iverson,\n1992). In the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers, the\nAmazon turtle\u2019s and the tracaj\u00e1\u2019s nesting sea-\nson extends from June to December.\nDuring this period the level of the main and\ntributary rivers fall drastically, exposing the\nsandy banks which are used for nest placement.\nThe geological aspects of these sandy banks,\ncommonly denominated beaches, vary\nalong the rivers being controlled by the charac-\nteristics of the substratum and hydrological\nregime.\n\nThe distribution of the P. expansa and\nP. unifilis nests along the sandy banks allows\nthe characterization of environments appropri-\nate to each of the species. In spite of the mor-\nphological differences of the sandy banks of\nseveral places, it is possible to recognize geo-\nlogical conditioning common to the turtle nest-\ning areas (Ferreira J\u00fanior 2003). In general, it\nis observed that the P. expansa prefers\nthe   central part of the beaches, where the\nheight relative to the river water level surpasses\n3.3 m on the date of the laying. The P. unifilis\nchooses upstream and downstream the areas\nof the beaches, where the sandy deposits usu-\nally are located 1.5 m above the river level,\non the day of the laying. The superposition of\nthe oviposition areas between these species\nis rare.\n\nAs P. expansa and P. unifilis present\nsexual determination dependent on the incuba-\ntion temperature (Alho et al., 1985; Souza\n&amp; Vogt, 1994,;Valenzuela et al., 1997) it is\nimportant to know the nesting environment\nthat, together with the variations of the me-\nteorological conditions (i.e. rainfall, exposure to\nsunlight and the temperature of the air) will\ndetermine the temperature to which the eggs\nwill be submitted. The hydric and thermal sur-\nroundings of the turtle nests can be influenced\nby several environmental and ecological factors,\nsuch as the mineralogical composition (Milton\net al., 1997) and the sediments grain size (Souza\n\n&amp; Vogt, 1994; Ferreira J\u00fanior, 2003), the al-\nbedo (Hays et al., 2001), the nest\ndepth (Burger, 1976; Wilhoft et al., 1983), the\nnest placement (Vogt &amp; Bull, 1984; Whitmore\n&amp; Dutton, 1985; Horrocks &amp; Scott, 1991;\nHays &amp; Speakman, 1993), the vegetational\ncover (Vogt &amp; Bull, 1984; Janzen, 1994;\nJanzen &amp; Morjan, 2001) and the date of lay-\ning (Vogt &amp; Bull, 1982; Mrosovsky et al.,\n1984).\n\nIn this work, the geological characteris-\ntics of the P. expansa and P. unifilis nesting areas\nin the Java\u00e9s River, right margin of the Bananal\nIsland in the state of Tocantins will be\nanalyzed. From August 3 to December 15,\n2000, we collected information about six\nbeaches in which had 339 P. expansa and 487\nP. unifilis nests were labeled. All of these\nbeaches can be classified as point bars. Their\nsediment grain size concentrates in the sand size\nwith very low mud content. The mineralogical\ncomposition is basically formed of quartz and\nfeldspar.\n\nLocation and physiographic\naspects of the area\n\nThe studied area is located at the mar-\ngins of the Java\u00e9s River, which is the eastern\nborder of Bananal Island, the largest fluvial is-\nland of the world. The northern part\nof the Bananal island forms the National\nPark of Araguaia, where the Center of Conser-\nvation and Management of Reptiles and Am-\nphibians (RAN), an organ linked to the\nBrazilian    Institute of Renewable Natural Re-\nsources (IBAMA), has a field base that sup-\nports  management, research and protection\nactivities   for P. expansa and P. unifilis.\n(Figure 1) during the   laying, incubation and\nhatching season.\n\nThe climatic seasonality is remarkable,\nwith a rainy season going from September to\nMarch and a dry season from April to Sep-\ntember. The total annual rain is around 1750\nmm (IBAMA, 1995). Due to this rainfall dis-\ntribution, the level of the Java\u00e9s River has ex-\ntreme oscillations. During the dry season, the\npoint bars emerge and they are used by turtles\nand birds (black skimmer Rynchops nigra and\nlarged-billed tern Phaetusa simplex) as nesting\nsites. Rainfall close to the riverhead can cause\nsmall and fast rises (\u201crepiquetes\u201d) in the level\nof the Java\u00e9s and Araguaia rivers.\n\n\n\n447Geological control of turtles nesting...\n\nComprida Beach\n\nJaburu Beach\n\nCangu\u00e7u Beach\n\nMurici Beach\n\nJava\n\u00e9s Riv\n\ner\n\nGoiaba Beach\n\nPombas Lake\n\nCoc\nal C\n\nhan\nnel\n\n600596\n8896\n\n9000\n\n9004\n\n0 2000 m500 500\n\nLagoa Beach\n\nAlta Beach\n\nMarreca Beach\n\nN\n\nBras\u00edlia\n\n9008\n\n9 55'O\n\n50 10'O 50 05'O\n10 00'O\n\nBonita Beach\n\nTocantins State\n\nA\nra\n\ngu\nai\n\na \nR\n\niv\ner\n\nPalmas\n\nTo\nca\n\nnt\nin\n\ns \nR\n\niv\ner\n\nJa\nva\n\n\u00e9s\n R\n\niv\ner\n\nStudy Area\n\nBrazil\n\nFigure 1 - Map showing the location of the studied areas.\n\n\n\n448   Ferreira J\u00fanior &amp; Castro\n\nBecause the extensive sandy banks used\nby the turtles are located inside the channel,\nthere is no vegetational cover. The riparian\nforest that surrounds the Java\u00e9s River\ninterferes very little in the environment of the\nbeach. During the hottest part of the day, most\nof the nests receive direct sunlight. Few\nof them which are located at the limit of the\nbeach and forest are shaded at the end of the\nafternoon.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nSix  beaches have been chosen, namely\nCangu\u00e7u, Jaburu, Comprida, Marreca, Coco\nand Murici are located close to the RAN/\nIBAMA field base. These beaches have the\nlargest concentration of P. expansa and P. unifilis\nnests in the Araguaia National Park. Searching\nfor nests is done by members of the research\nteams and by the agents of IBAMA. Every\nmorning the beaches are spanned, looking for\ntracks left by the turtles  in previous night. The\ntracks are followed until the nests are located\nand labeled with numbered sticks.\n\nDuring the monitoring of the laying sea-\nson, it was decided not to label the nests of P.\nunifilis in the Marreca and Murici beaches.\nBoth of them have fine sand and it is hard to\nlocate nests there, since wind action frequently\nobscures the turtle tracks. However, the\nJaburu and Comprida beaches that are also\nformed    by fine sand were monitored because\nthey are  located close to the IBAMA field\nbase. In this case, the travel time to the beaches\nis so short to permit the observation of some\nP. unifilis tracks before the wind\nobliterates them.\n\nThe mapping of the beaches was done\non a scale of 1:1000 using theodolite, compass\nand tape measure. This scale allowed the rep-\nresentation of the main beach morphology and\nchannel features, as well as the plotting of all\nthe turtle nests. The mapping was accom-\nplished in the month of October, when the ovi-\nposition had been finished, in order not to in-\nterfere in the laying process. The height of the\nnests was measured with the aid of a Kern\nlevel with a precision of 5 mm. The measure-\nments were made in order to define two height\ntypes:\n\nThe height on the laying date, which\nreflects the topographical conditions found by\nthe turtles during the oviposition.\n\nThe maximum height of the nests, aim-\ning the establishment of a common pattern\namong the several beaches, with respect to the\ntopographical conditions.\n\nThe maximum height of the nests was\nregistered on November 1st, when the Java\u00e9s\nRiver reached its lowest depth. On this day,\nthe Java\u00e9s River depth was taken and it al-\nlowed comparisons among the heights of the\nnests in all the beaches. The level of the Java\u00e9s\nRiver was taken daily close to the IBAMA\nbase from August to December, during the nest\nmonitoring period.\n\nAs the beaches are composed of sedi-\nments, generally poorly selected and disposed\nin layers, samples were collected close to the\nmaterial that recovers the nests and which was\nhomogenized during the closing of the nests by\nthe turtle females. Three hundred and twelve\nsamples of sediments were submitted to the\ngranular analysis according to the scale of Folk/\nWentworth (Table 1).\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Granulometric fractions used in the analyses of 312 samples of sediments collected in\nthe nests of P. expansa and P. unifilis. Dimensions are given in mm.\n\nStudent\u2019s t-test was used in the analy-\nsis of the variations of the height, incubation\nduration and depth of the nests between P.\nexpansa and P. unifilis. Variance analysis\n(ANOVA) has been used for determination of\nthe variations of the incubation duration along\nthe beaches. Linear regression has been used in\n\nthe determination of the grain size influence of\nthe sediments on the incubation duration.\nAll statistical analysis was performed accord-\ning   to Zar (1998). Significance has been ac-\ncepted at a level of 5%.

The dimensions of\nthe point bars depend on their positioning,\n\nwith the   dimensions on the left margin\nbeing smaller than those on the right\nmargin   (Table 3). The height of the  nests of\nP. expansa    approximately indicates the height\nof the  beaches. According to the   average val-\nues it can be observed that,   in    the place\nchosen   for nesting by P. expansa,   the\nbeaches   of the  left margin are higher\nthan the ones of the right margin\n(Table 4).\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Dimensions of the point bars of the Java\u00e9s River used for nesting by P. expansa in the\nstudied area.

The grain size refers to the granulometric fractions of medium and\nfine sand.\n\nIt was possible to delineate two groups\nof beaches with different characteristics from\nthe grain size analysis of samples collected in\nthe nests of P. expansa (221 samples) and\nP. unifilis (92 samples). The Jaburu, Marreca,\nMurici, and Comprida beaches present\nfiner sediments, well selected and concentrated\nin the fine and medium sand fractions.\nThe other group is formed by Cangu\u00e7u\nand Coco beaches where the sediments\nare coarse, poorly selected, and they are\ndistributed in the very coarse, coarse, medium,\nand fine sand fractions (Table 7). The content\nof mud in all the six beaches is small and\nrestricted to temporary ponds at the\ntrough  of the dunes. The maximum volume of\nclay registered was 6.08%, the mean being\n0.12% \u00b1 0.38.\n\nData on the monitoring provided\nby IBAMA show the distribution of the\nnests of P. expansa since the implementation\nof the project in 1990. The P. expansa usually\nchose the beaches of the right margin\n(Figure 5).\n\nThe point bars differ not only for their\ndimensions and grain size, but each margin\npresents its own geological characteristics.\nThe point bars of the left margin are shorter\nand higher than those of the right margin\n(Tables 3 and 4). In general, the grain size of\nthe sediments that compose the beaches of the\nright margin is coarse than those of the left\nmargin.

The P. expansa chooses the highest points\nin the center of the beach close to the internal\nlimit of the point bars (Figure 6). The highest\nnest is placed on a channel chute bar in the\ndownstream portion of the beach.\n\nThe nests of P. unifilis are predomi-\nnantly found in the upstream and downstream\nparts of the Jaburu beach. The nests are lo-\ncated mainly close to the base of the dunes.\nOn the nesting date the nests are usually lo-\ncated in sand lower than 1.5 m in height (x =\n132 \u00b1 100.2 cm). In the center of the beach,\nclose to the external margin (close to the water\nline), the nests of P. unifilis are located where\nthe height is lower.\n\nMarreca Beach\n\nChannel chute bars with its typical\nlobed geometry occur in the downstream por-\ntion of the Jaburu and Marreca beaches. The\nsubsequent part of these bars has bushes, which\nhelps its fixation. Marreca beach (Figure 7), like\nthe other point bars of the Java\u00e9s River, has\nits downstream internal limit formed by a\nscarp which is formed by erosion due to sec-\nondary channels flow during the flood period.\nInside these channels the chute bars are de-\nvelop. It is common to find nests of\nP. expansa in the top of the chute bars that\nfrequently constitute the highest portion of the\npoint bars. In the Marreca beach four nests of\nP. expansa were found in the top of the chute\nbars while in the Jaburu beach only two nests\nwere found.\n\nMurici Beach\n\nMurici beach has a concentration of 26\nnests in a small area of about 1 ha (Figure 8).\nThe upstream and downstream portion of the\nMurici beach and the places close to the exter-\n\nnal margin are avoided by the P. expansa, be-\ncause the height in these places is very low,\nunder 1.5 m.\n\nMurici beach presents a pattern of dis-\ntribution of chelonian nests similar to Jaburu\nand Marreca beaches. There is a continuous in-\ncrease in the height of the beach towards the\ncenter portion of the point bar in a \u201cslope\u201d\npattern.\n\nIn Jaburu, Marreca and Murici beaches\nthe exit of the P. expansa happens always in\nspecific points in the troughs of the dunes,\nwhich act as a connection between the deepest\nparts of the river and the beaches. The path\nfollowed by the turtles, marked by their tracks,\ndescribes a path upstream as well as down-\nstream, with no apparent preferential direction.\nP. expansa tracks are not found on the abrupt\nmargins of the beach, where the declivity is\nhigh.\n\nBeaches of the right margin\n\nCangu\u00e7u Beach\n\nCangu\u00e7u beach marks the upstream limit\nwhere the nesting of P. expansa in significant\nnumbers. Above this beach the Java\u00e9s River\nbecomes shallower, frequently less than 30 cm\ndeep, and the beaches become lower with rare\nhigh elevations points. This fact preclude\nP. expansa nestsing. On the other hand, the\nP. unifilis is common upstream Cangu\u00e7u beach,\nin spite of being not as abundant as in the\nstudy area.\n\nWhen the water level of the Java\u00e9s River\nlowered during the dry season extensive sandy\nbanks in the center portion of Cangu\u00e7u beach\nemerged. These deposits subdivide the\n\u201cboiadouro\u201d (popular denomination of the\ndeepest points of the rivers where the chelo-\nnian await for the adequate moment to exit for\nthe nesting \u2013 Figure 2) in two parts. These\nparts are linked by a narrow channel. P. expansa\nemerge from \u201cboiadouro\u201d through this channel\nto the beach. P. expansa do not nest on the part\nof the beach in front of the sandbanks portion\nnear the \u201cboiadouro\u201d.\n\n\n\n456   Ferreira J\u00fanior &amp; Castro\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Distribution of P. expansa and P. unifilis nests along the Jaburu Beach.\n\n\n\n457Geological control of turtles nesting...\n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Distribution  of   P. expansa nests along the Marreca Beach.\n\nP. expansa exit\n\nAmazon turtle return\n\nP. expansa  return\n\n P\nat\n\nh \nfo\n\nllo\nw\n\ned\n b\n\ny \nth\n\ne A\nma\n\nzo\nn t\n\nur\ntle\n\n du\nrin\n\ng t\nhe \n\nnes\ntin\n\ng\n\nDownstream: low part of the point bar constituted of small dunes \noriented in high angle with respect to Java\u00e9s River direction.\n\nChannel chute bar: deposits generated in the period of flooding. \nThey are formed by a topographical hight that are used as nesting \nplace by some .P. expansa\n\nCenter: high part of the point bar.

The accretionary dune front\nis oriented at a low angle in respect to the chan-\nnel direction. It is separated from the down-\nstream part by a topographical high area which\nhad 23 nests of P. expansa, along 32 ha. Dur-\ning the dry season, erosive processes occur in\nthe upstream portion of the beach where the\ncurvature of the channel is more pronounced.\nAs a result of the erosive processes a 1m high\nscarp at the external margin of the beach is\nformed. This scarp acts as a barrier for the P.\nexpansa and P. unifilis to exit from water to\nbeach in this area. b) Downstream \u2013 there is a\nnarrow, long part of the beach, without pro-\nnounced topographical high, where the dunes\ncrests is in high angle with respect to the chan-\nnel direction. The height of the beach increases\nslowly and gradually towards the internal part\nof the point bar. The arrangement of the dunes\nin high angle favors the development of sev-\neral access channels in their trough. The nest-\ning of P. expansa take place in the internal\nmargin of the beach close to the forest. Cocal\nchannel has the largest number of nests of P.\nexpansa. It has water only during the high water\nseason, when the Java\u00e9s River winds its way\nthrough its extensive floodplain and creates\nalternative paths for water flow (Figure 1). In\nthis place of about 4 ha, 33 nests of P. expansa\nwere found. The nests of P. unifilis are distrib-\nuted throughout the nesting area and concen-\ntrate close to the base of the dunes.\n\nComprida Beach\n\nIt can be divided in two parts, due to\nthe complexity of the deposits and the con-\ncentration of the nests. A narrow sandy strip,\nup to 10 m wide and 250 m long, makes the\nconnection between the upstream and down-\nstream domains, submerged after the beginning\nof November (Figure 10). a) Upstream \u2013 it is\nmarked by channel chute bars that apparently\nhave been deposited through the interaction of\nthe flow of the Java\u00e9s and Riozinho rivers.\nShrub growth stabilizes the sand deposits of\nthe channel chute bars. There were four P.\nexpansa nests and only one P. unifilis nest found\n\nin this habitat. b) Downstream \u2013 it is a shelf\nformed by the migration and overposition of\nseveral dunes with crests in a high angle with\nrespect to the channel direction. It is a well\nmarked topographical unevenness. In this place,\nin 1999, a large nesting of P. expansa was reg-\nistered, with about 120 nests. At the end of\nthe point bar there are several channel chute\nbars that are responsible for the largest heights\nregistered on the beach.\n\nThe P. expansa took advantage of the\ncountless existing access channels in the trough\nof the dunes in order to reach the beach. Fifty-\nfive nests of P. unifilis are distributed in the\nupstream part of this domain, where the height\nof the point bar is up to 2 m high. The nests\nconcentrate mainly at the base of the dunes.\nThe access to the nesting place is done, fre-\nquently, from the channels located in the trough\nof these dunes. There is not a specific point\nthrough which a great number of turtles ascend\nto the beach.\n\nCoco Beach\n\nIt is a large point bar developed in a\nmeander on the right margin of the Java\u00e9s River\n(Table 3). It  had the largest number of P.\nexpansa and P. unifilis nests in 2000 (Figure\n11). The upstream portion shows evidence of\nrecent deposition, emerging for the first time\nin 2000. The amalgamation of the deposits is\nnot verified and as a consequence, the height\nof the nests of P. unifilis registered is below 46\n\u00b1 5.94 cm at the time of the laying (n = 22)\nand 108 \u00b1 8.52 cm in November 1st, when the\nJava\u00e9s River was at its smallest level. Most of\nthe nests of P. unifilis are located on crest of\nthe dunes in this area. There are nests close to\nthe base of the dunes, and not just on the crest\nof the dunes  in places where the height of the\nbeach is higher.\n\nThe downstream part is plain, includ-\ning dunes of small size spaced in a high angle\nwith respect to the direction of the river. Since\namalgamation of the deposits generated by the\nmigration of the dunes does not happen, the\nheights are modest. In this case there is only\none P. unifilis nest. In November the rising of\nthe Java\u00e9s River caused the fast inundation of\nalmost all the nesting area.\n\n\n\n460   Ferreira J\u00fanior &amp; Castro\n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Distribution of P. expansa and P. unifilis nests along the Cangu\u00e7u Beach.\n\n\n\n461Geological control of turtles nesting...\n\nJa\nva\n\n\u00e9s\n R\n\niv\ner\n\nThe dunes have the crests oriented obliquely with respect to the \nJava\u00e9s River direction.

The dunes\nare of medium to large size, spaced, with crests\nat a high angle with respect to the channel di-\nrection, and frequently they cross the beach en-\ntirely. The spacing between the dunes is re-\nduced in the downstream direction and they\nstart to migrate one over the other, amalgamat-\ning and increasing the height of the point bar.\nA small-vegetated area serves as an obstacle to\nthe migration of the dunes in the middle of the\nbeach. The beach is flat in this area. The end\nof the area of nesting of P. expansa is marked\nby an accretionary dune front, about 200 cm\nhigh. The amalgamation of the deposits has\ncreated a great elevation in this area, whose\ncrest is almost parallel to the direction of the\nchannel.\n\nThe location of the tracks of P. expansa\nindicates that exist is at specific point, close\nto the trough of a great dune. The path of the\nturtles had a paraboloid shape not only up-\nstream but downstream as well. The return did\nnot occur in a specific point of the channel.\nThe concentration of exits of the turtle at a\ngiven point can be explained based in the mor-\nphology of the beach and in the existing rela-\ntionships between the sandy deposits and the\n\u201cboiadouro\u201d. Sandy upstream bars, although\nimmersed to small depths, made the locomo-\ntion of P. expansa difficult. The points that\nallow the connection between the \u201cboiadouro\u201d\nand the beach are restricted and concentrated\nin the trough of the dunes, way ahead of the\nhighest parts of the point bar.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTemperature-dependent sex determina-\ntion in most species of turtle studied raised at-\ntention to the conditions that govern or inter-\nact with the substratum, determining the tem-\nperature which the eggs undergo during the em-\nbryogenesis. According to Charnov &amp; Bull\n(1977), Bull (1980), Bulmer &amp; Bull (1982), and\nJanzen &amp; Morjan (2001) the sex ratio of the\noffspring is governed by two factors: a) ther-\nmal sensitivity of the embryo to the sexual de-\ntermination, b) maternal choice of the thermal\n\nqualities of the nesting place. Janzen &amp; Morjan\n(2001) showed that Chrysemys picta use the\nsame microenvironment in successive nesting,\nwhich is in agreement the theory that the fe-\nmales can \u201ccontrol\u201d the sex ratio of the off-\nspring by the choice of the thermal environ-\nmental of the nests.\n\nSeveral examples show the importance\nof the nesting place in the survival and in the\nembryonic development of several lizard spe-\ncies and turtles. In all cases it seems clear that\nthe choice of the nesting places is not random\nand seeks to match the physiologic character-\nistics of the adult females (i.e. size and terres-\ntrial locomotion agility) and characteristics of\nthe clutches (i.e. clutch size) to the character-\nistics of the environment (hydric and thermal)\nthat will control the embryogenesis.\n\nFor Ewert et al. (1994) the pivotal tem-\nperature will have a decisive influence on the\nplace chosen for the nesting of four fresh wa-\nter species in a same region. Therefore the sex\nratio of the offspring stays balanced, since the\nfemales use places with different thermal char-\nacteristics. This would compensate the differ-\nences of the pivotal temperature among the\nspecies.\n\nBurger (1976) has observed that the\ntemperature of the nests of Malaclemys terra-\npin terrapin depends on the position of the nest\non a sandy dune. Hays et al. (2001) had at-\ntributed the thermal variations in the several\nenvironments of the beaches to the albedo dif-\nference. Bodie (2001), in a compilation work,\npointed out that most of the species of fresh\nwater turtle prefer open and sandy beaches for\nthe nesting and that they can seek alternative\nhabitats, such as levees, when their traditional\nnesting places are not available. Raising of the\nriver could put the eggs at risk, as pointed by\nAlho &amp; P\u00e1dua (1982), for P. expansa and by\nStanding et al. (1999), for Emydoidea\nblandingi.\n\nSouza &amp; Vogt (1994), while analyzing\nP. unifilis in Costa Marques (RO), had indicated\nthat nests located in sunny places and in sedi-\nments in the coarse size sands (1 to 0.5 mm,\naccording to these authors\u2019 classification) ex-\nperiment larger daily temperature fluctuation.\nThe average temperature of the nests located\nin sediments in the coarse size sand is larger\n\n\n\n464   Ferreira J\u00fanior &amp; Castro\n\nthan that of the nests in fine sand. These au-\nthors did not associate the sex ratio of the off-\nspring with the grain size of the substratum;\nthey just suggested that the nests located in\ncoarse sediments would bias female sex ratio\nmore than those placed in finer sediments.\n\nThe grain size of the substratum where\nthe nests are placed does not have influence\nonly on the temperature. For the sea turtle Che-\nlonia mydas to makes a nest cavity it is neces-\nsary that the place presents humidity or small\nroots that give enough cohesion to the substra-\ntum in order to prevent the walls from tum-\nbling (Bustard &amp; Greenham, 1968). Chelonia\nmydas constructs a nest more easily in finer\nsand (Mortimer &amp; Carr, 1987). The coarse and\ndry sand makes the opening of the nests diffi-\ncult, forcing the females to dig several places\nbefore finding an appropriate local.\n\nHatchling success is influenced strongly\nby the nest site for fresh water turtle species\nas P. expansa (Alho &amp; P\u00e1dua, 1982; Ferreira\nJ\u00fanior 2003), Emys orbicularis (Servan et al.,\n1989), E. blandingii (Standing et al., 1999), and\nsea turtle species such as Dermochelys\ncoriacea (Whitmore &amp; Dutton, 1985),\nEretmochelys imbricata (Horrocks &amp; Scott,\n1991) and Caretta caretta (Hays &amp; Speakman,\n1993). Beaches with different hatchling success\npresent larger concentration of nests in the\npoints where the survival of the offspring is\nlarger (Horrocks &amp; Scott, 1991; Hays &amp;\nSpeakman, 1993).\n\nBragg et al. (2000) compared the nest-\ning locals of different lizards, and the species\nwith temperature-dependent sex determination\non the (Eublepharis macularius and\nHemitheconyx caudicinctus) preferred places\nwith intermediate temperatures. On the other\nhand, the species Coleonyx mitratus, which\npossesses genetic sexual determination, did not\nhave a preferred place.\n\nIn the Java\u00e9s River the nesting areas of\nP. expansa and P. unifilis show different mor-\nphologic aspects. Although both species can\nuse the same point bar each species chooses\nmorphologically different places to nest. The\nmineralogical constitution is relatively homo-\ngeneous in all the six beaches and it does not\ninfluence the nest site chosen by individuals\nof either the both species, nor does it affect\nduration incubation.\n\nThe data suggest that the grain size dis-\ntribution in and among different beaches affects\nsignificantly the incubation duration of P.\nexpansa. The P. expansa is selective in the\nchoice of the nesting places, preferring histori-\ncally the beaches constituted by coarse sedi-\nments. Since 1990 (Figure 5) the largest con-\ncentrations of nests always took place in the\npoint bars of the right margin. Besides the larger\ncomplexity of the beaches, the grain size sedi-\nments of the right margin are coarse. This fact\nindicate a primary control of the geological\naspects on the reproductive biology of P.\nexpansa.\n\nThe incubation duration varies signifi-\ncantly among the beaches for P. expansa due\nin part to the influenced of grain size of the\nsediments (Table 6 and Figure 4a). There are\ndifferences of incubation duration between the\nCoco beach, with a mean of 54.2 \u00b1 4.48 days,\nand Comprida beach, with a mean of 68.3 \u00b1\n7.70 days. The longer incubation duration for\nComprida beach is associated to its finer grain\nsize sediments. Grain size of the sediments\ninfluences on the incubation time for P. expansa,\nbut not for P. unifilis (Table 6). Other elements\nshould be interacting and affecting the embryo-\ngenesis of P. unifilis.\n\nIt is worth highlighting two characteris-\ntics that are different for the two species stud-\nied: the height of the nests and the eggshell\ntype. In accordance with Pritchard &amp; Trebbau\n(1984) the eggshell of P. expansa is flexible and\nthe one of P. unifilis is rigid. For Packard et al.\n(1982) eggs with flexible eggshells are more\nsensitive to the variations of the hydric envi-\nronment, absorbing water in humid conditions\nand becoming dehydrated in dry ones. The\nwater exchange with the environment is related\nto the metabolic rate, affecting the incubation\nduration. Eggs with rigid eggshells, as P. unifilis,\npresent low porosity and little exchange of\nwater with the environment, being less depen-\ndent from the hydric environment. Thus, it\nseems that for P. unifilis the rate of embryonic\ndevelopment and the incubation duration are\nnot affected by the hydric conditions of the\nnests.\n\nThe difference in the constitution of the\neggshells of the P. expansa and P. unifilis eggs\n(Pritchard &amp; Trebbau, 1984) helps to under-\n\n\n\n465Geological control of turtles nesting...\n\nstand the differences found in the microenvi-\nronment in the nests. The rigid eggshell of P.\nunifilis makes possible incubation at smaller\ndepths. Perhaps, this would be possible even\nin drier places, because the dehydration of the\neggs is minimized by the small porosity of the\neggshell (Packard et al., 1982). On the other\nhand the eggs of P. expansa demand a greater\ndepth (Figure 3b), since the eggshell does not\nsupply an adequate protection against the de-\nhydration.\n\nThe height and the depth of the nests\nof P. unifilis and P. expansa should also affect\nthe microenvironment of the nests (Figure 3a\nand 3b). The P. expansa nests are deeper than\nthe P. unifilis nests (Figure 3b), which in part,\ncontrol the distribution of the nests along the\nbeaches. Wilson (1998) suggests that medium\nand large sized turtles, such as P. expansa (Alho\net al., 1985) and Apalone mutica (Plummer et\nal. 1994), nesting in open areas to maximize\nthe exhibition of the nests to the sun, and small\nturtles as Kinosternon baurii need the protec-\ntion of the vegetation and of the humidity since\nthey can not dig deep nests and avoid very high\ntemperatures. Shallow nests are submitted to\nlarge daily oscillations of temperature (Burger,\n1976; Thompson, 1988; Wilson, 1998). The\nlower depth of the water table and the stem-\nming increase of humidity could minimize the\ndaily variations of the temperature. The greater\nhumidity would minimize the influence of the\nheat exchange, which is more effective in coarse\nand dry sediments than in fine and humid sedi-\nments (Harrison, 1985; Novak &amp; Black, 1985;\nHarrison &amp; Morrison, 1993).\n\nThe bottom of the clutch of P. expansa\nis located at an mean depth of 61 cm (Figure\n3b). Algo in oceanic beaches there are not sig-\nnificant differences of the sand temperature at\na depth of 60 cm (Mrosovsky et al., 1984). In\nspite of the difference between the sea and flu-\nvial environments, it is believed that the pro-\nfile of heat transmission in large depths has a\nsimilar behavior, with daily variations of tem-\nperature being small at such depths. A greater\nheight of the beach is required so that the hu-\nmidity originated from the water table is in a\nrange appropriate to the incubation.\n\nAnother fact that can be related to the\ngreater height required by the eggs is the syn-\n\nchronism between the drought of the river and\nthe nesting behavior of P. expansa. The begin-\nning of the nesting season is associated with\nthe stabilization of the river in its lowest level\n(Alho &amp; P\u00e1dua, 1982). The survivorship of late\nhatching of some clutches would be influenced\nif the rise of the river water level were antici-\npated. In this case, higher areas nesting posi-\ntion allows the hatching of most of the nests,\neven if the level of the river rises faster\n(\u201crepiquetes\u201d). The eggs of P. unifilis, in the\n2000 nesting season, begin hatching in the sec-\nond half of October, before water level\nbegan to rise.\n\nThe choice of the nest sites is related to\nsome habitat requirements, such as, the pres-\nence of \u201cboiadouros\u201d, access channels and to-\npographical levels. The morphology of the\nbeach will bring direct consequences to the dis-\ntribution of the nests. Wide and relatively\nplain and uniform areas such as the central part\nof the Marreca beach (Figure 7) and the up-\nstream part of the Cangu\u00e7u beach present nests\nof P. expansa uniformly distributed. The ap-\npropriate height for P. expansa is only reached\nwhen the river water flow makes successive\nevents of migration of the dunes and amalgam-\nation of the dunes. The choice of the central\npart of the beaches of the right margin (Figure\n9 and 11) explains this aspect. The separation\namong the high areas, chosen by P. expansa and\nthe low parts, selected by P. unifilis in Coco,\nCangu\u00e7u, Comprida and Murici beaches is clear.\n\nThe dimensions and morphology of the\npoint bars will depend on their positioning and\ninteraction with the water flow of the channel.\nIn spite of being smaller, the point bars of the\nleft margin are higher and its external margins\nare more abrupt, which sometimes hinders the\naccess of the females to the nesting places. A\ngreat elevation of a place alone is not enough\nto define the best area for nesting of P. expansa\n(Tables 3 and 4). In spite of the smaller heights,\nthe beaches of the right margin are, historically,\nthe most used by P. expansa (Figure 1 and 5).\n\nThe Java\u00e9s River is deep and calm\nenough to allow the turtles to rest in the vicin-\nity of the beaches. The Cangu\u00e7u beach clearly\nexemplifies the importance of the\n\u201cboiadouros\u201d. The greater concentration of\nnests in 1990, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997 (Figure\n\n\n\n466   Ferreira J\u00fanior &amp; Castro\n\n5) happened at the Cangu\u00e7u beach. Nowadays,\nthe Cangu\u00e7u beach importance has been reduced\nin comparison to Coco and Comprida beaches.\nReports of the field agents that work in the\nproject since its implantation in 1990 describe\nthe decrease of the \u201cboiadouro\u201d as a result of\nthe formation of sandy banks that, even when\nsubmerged, make the navigation in the area dif-\nficult. The smaller nesting of P. expansa in\nCangu\u00e7u beach is partially attributed to the\ndecrease of the \u201cboiadouro\u201d area.\n\nThe nesting decrease of P. expansa in\nComprida beach in 2000 is not well understood,\nsince the \u201cboiadouro\u201d is still deep and there is\neasy access to the beach without the presence\nof sandy banks to difficult the turtles exit. The\nbeach height remained similar up until last year.\nThe decrease of more than 120 nests, in 1999,\nto only 18 nests in 2000, will only be explained\nwith the monitoring for couples of years more.\n\nDue to its smaller size and larger mobil-\nity, P. unifilis reach the beaches more easily, fre-\nquently using the channels in the trough of\nsmall dunes, which are common along the up-\nstream and downstream parts of the point bars\n(Figures 9, 10 and 11). Channels of access that\nexist in the trough of the dunes make the con-\nnection of the \u201cboiadouro\u201d to the highest points\nof the beach. Its importance can be verified at\nCoco beach, where the exit of P. expansa is con-\ncentrated at one only point. This fact helps to\nunderstand the high nesting rate in that por-\ntion of the point bar. In the other beaches, where\nthere are several access channels or the mor-\nphology of the beach is a ramp-like, there was\nnot a high concentration of nests at only one\npoint. The exit of P. expansa happens in only\none point of in the upstream portion of\nCangu\u00e7u beach close to a submerged sandy bank\nthat marks the upstream limit of the\n\u201cboiadouro\u201d.\n\nSouza &amp; Vogt (1994) attribute the dif-\nferentiation of the nesting areas of these spe-\ncies in the beaches, to the fact that the destruc-\ntion of the nests of P. unifilis by P. expansa\nthat nested later. This hypothesis is rejected\nfor the beaches monitored in the Java\u00e9s River,\nbecause besides being very wide, there is not a\nsuperposition of the nesting areas. The distri-\nbution of the nests of P. expansa and P. unifilis\nshows the influence of the fluvial environment\n\non the choice of the nesting area. This distri-\nbution in separated morphological places\nshould be considered in the management\nprojects that frequently use to transfer of nests.\nAs we could observe, it is not only sufficient\nto transfer the nests to high places, above\nthe earlier rise of the level of the\nrivers (\u201crepiquetes\u201d) because at least for the\nP. unifilis, proximity with the water table\nis required by the turtles at the moment\nof the nesting. If we change the environmental\nconditions (which means change in thermal\nand hydric conditions), we can somehow\ninduce unforeseen or poorly understood\nmodifications on the reproductive biology of\nturtles.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is part of the PhD research\nof Paulo Dias Ferreira J\u00fanior accomplished in\nthe Departamento de Geologia of the\nUniversidade Federal de Ouro Preto, with a\nscholarship by CAPES.
