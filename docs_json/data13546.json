Este processo \u00e9 mediado por microrganismos e ocorre em associa\u00e7\u00e3o \ncom a  redu\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfato, sendo tamb\u00e9m respons\u00e1vel pelo consumo de \nquantidades significativas de metano em sedimentos marinhos que, de outra\nforma, seriam libertadas para a hidrosfera e, consequentemente para a\natmosfera, contribuindo para o agravamento do efeito de estufa. Durante o \ncruzeiro SONNE-175 GAP (Gibraltar Arc Processes), foram recolhidas\namostras de sedimentos atrav\u00e9s de multicores e gravity cores, tendo em vista \na realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de an\u00e1lises biogeoqu\u00edmicas. No trabalho aqui exposto, usaram-se \namostras de cinco vulc\u00f5es de lama: Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim Ginsburg, \nGemini e No Name. Foram analisados os seguintes par\u00e2metros geoqu\u00edmicos:\nmetano, sulfato, sulfeto e hidrocarbonetos C2+; os perfis obtidos da an\u00e1lise das \nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es destes compostos revelaram a exist\u00eancia de uma zona bem \ndefinida nos sedimentos sub-superficiais, na qual ocorre o consumo total do\nmetano e do sulfato, bem como o consumo de hidrocarbonetos mais pesados\n(zona de transi\u00e7\u00e3o sulfato-metano). Esta particularidade tamb\u00e9m foi \nconfirmada pela medi\u00e7\u00e3o de taxas de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o anaer\u00f3bia de metano e de \ntaxas de redu\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfato, as quais evidenciaram o acoplamento dos dois\nprocessos, apesar das taxas de redu\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfato serem, geralmente, mais\nelevadas. As baixas taxas de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o anaer\u00f3bia de metano, relativamente \u00e0s \ntaxas de redu\u00e7\u00e3o do sulfato, bem como o consumo de hidrocarbonetos na \nzona de transi\u00e7\u00e3o sulfato-metano, evidenciam que em alguns vulc\u00f5es de lama, \na redu\u00e7\u00e3o do sulfato ocorre acoplada n\u00e3o s\u00f3 \u00e0 oxida\u00e7\u00e3o de metano mas\ntamb\u00e9m de outros hidrocarbonetos mais pesados.  \nForam tamb\u00e9m levadas a cabo an\u00e1lises de biomarcadores lip\u00eddicos, bem como \nan\u00e1lises de is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis de carbono (?13C), de forma a identificar \ntaxonomicamente os organismos envolvidos no consumo do metano. Estas\nan\u00e1lises revelaram concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas de l\u00edpidos provenientes de\nmembranas de archaea e de bact\u00e9rias redutoras de sulfato. Por outro lado, os \nvalores reduzidos de ?13C na zona de transi\u00e7\u00e3o sulfato-metano, indicam que a \noxida\u00e7\u00e3o anaer\u00f3bia do metano \u00e9 mediada por um cons\u00f3rcio microbiano \nprotagonizado por archaea e bact\u00e9rias redutoras de sulfato. Adicionalmente, a\npresen\u00e7a de l\u00edpidos em carbonatos autig\u00e9nicos dos vulc\u00f5es de lama\nHesperides e Faro, sugerem a influ\u00eancia da oxida\u00e7\u00e3o anaer\u00f3bia do metano na \nsua precipita\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, os dados dispon\u00edveis apontam para a \npossibilidade de varia\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais poderem influenciar a diversidade das\ncomunidades metanotr\u00f3ficas, tal como \u00e9 demonstrado pelas abund\u00e2ncias\nrelativas em diferentes vulc\u00f5es de lama dos biomarcadores archaeol e sn2-\nhidroxiarchaeol, e dos \u00e1cidos gordos bacterianos,  i-C15:0, ai-C15:0; C16:1?5 e\ncyC17:0?5,6. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n  \nKeywords \n \n\nMud Volcano, Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane, Sulphate Reduction, Archaea-\nBacteria Consortium \n \n\nAbstract \n \n\nThe main goal of this study was to assess the state of activity of some of the \nGulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes, concerning a very important biogeochemical \nprocess: anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). This process, mediated by \nmicrobial organisms, occurs coupled to sulphate reduction and is responsible \nfor the consumption of significant amounts of methane within marine\nsediments, which would otherwise be released to the atmosphere, contributing\nto the greenhouse effect. During the SONNE-175 GAP Cruise (Nov/Dec 2003) \nseveral gravity cores and multi-cores of sediments from Gulf of Cadiz mud \nvolcanoes were recovered for further biogeochemical analysis. In the scope of \nthe present work sediment cores from five mud volcanoes (Captain Arutyunov, \nBonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and No Name) were analysed. Several \ngeochemical parameters were measured, such as methane, sulphate, sulphide \nand C2+ compounds, showing a sharp sulphate-methane transition zone and\nrevealing the consumption of methane and sulphate within the sediment and \nalso the consumption of higher hydrocarbons. This was also confirmed by \nanaerobic oxidation of methane and sulphate reduction rate measurements,\nwhich indicate a coupling of the two processes, although sulphate reduction is\ngenerally higher than anaerobic oxidation of methane. Low anaerobic oxidation \nof methane rates relatively to sulphate reduction rates, as well as the C2+\nhydrocarbons concentration profiles, suggests that in some mud volcanoes, \nsulphate reduction is not only coupled to anaerobic oxidation of methane  but\nalso to anaerobic oxidation of higher hydrocarbons.  \nLipid biomarker and carbon isotope analysis were also carried out, in order to\nidentify chemotaxonomically the organisms involved in the consumption of\nmethane. High concentrations of lipid biomarkers associated with specific \narchaeal and bacterial membrane lipids and the low ?13C signatures at the \nsulphate-methane transition zone, indicate that AOM is mediated by a microbial\ncommunity of archaea and sulphate reducing bacteria. Furthermore, the\npresence of lipids in authigenic carbonates from the Hesperides and the Faro \nmud volcanoes show the influence of anaerobic oxidation of methane in their\nprecipitation. However, the available data suggest that differences in \nenvironmental settings appear to influence the biodiversity of the \nmethanotrophic communities, as it is shown by the different relative \nabundances of the archaeal biomarkers archaeol and sn2-hydroxyarchaeol, \nand the bacterial fatty acids, i-C15:0, ai-C15:0; C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6, in different \nmud volcanoes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n15 \n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 INTRODUCTION 19 \n\nI.1 \u2013 Nature and scope of this work 19 \n\nI.2 \u2013 Aims of this study 20 \n\nI.3 \u2013 Database 20 \n\nI.4 \u2013 Methodology 21 \n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 FLUID SEEPAGE AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL \nPROCESSES ON CONTINENTAL MARGINS 23 \n\nII.1 \u2013 Methane in nature 23 \n\nII.2 \u2013 Gas hydrates on continental margins, their potential and associated hazards 27 \n\nII.3 \u2013 Hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage and fluid escape structures on continental margins 32 \nII.3.1 \u2013 Mud volcanoes and mud diapirs 32 \nII.3.2 \u2013 Authigenic methane-related carbonate crusts and chimneys 35 \nII.3.3 \u2013 Pockmarks 36 \n\nII.4 \u2013 Microbial-related biogeochemical processes in marine sediments 36 \nII.4.1 \u2013 Sulphate Reduction 37 \nII.4.2 \u2013 Methanogenesis 37 \nII.4.3 \u2013 Aerobic oxidation of methane 38 \nII.4.4 \u2013 Aerobic sulphide oxidation 39 \nII.4.5 \u2013 Anaerobic oxidation of methane 39 \nII.4.6 \u2013 Tools to study anaerobic oxidation of methane 43 \n\nII.4.6.1 - Geochemical parameters 43 \nII.4.6.2 \u2013 Radiotracer Measurements 44 \nII.4.6.3 \u2013 Lipid Biomarkers Analysis 45 \nII.4.6.4 \u2013 Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis 48 \nII.4.6.5 \u2013 Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation (FISH) 50 \nII.4.6.6 \u2013 rDNA Phylogenies 51 \n\nTable of Contents \n\n\n\n16 \n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 CHARACTERIZATION OF THE STUDY AREA 53 \n\nIII.1 \u2013 Geological setting 53 \n\nIII.2 \u2013 The Gulf of Cadiz Mud Volcano Field 55 \n\nIII.3 \u2013 The SO 175 expedition: GAP cruise 56 \n\nIII.4 \u2013 Mud volcanoes studied in the present work 57 \nIII.4.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 58 \nIII.4.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano 58 \nIII.4.3 \u2013 Ginsburg mud volcano 59 \nIII.4.4 \u2013 Gemini mud volcano 60 \nIII.4.5 \u2013 No Name Mud Volcano 60 \n\nCHAPTER IV \u2013 METHODOLOGY AND LABORATORY \nPROCEDURES 61 \n\nIV.1 \u2013 Sampling 61 \n\nIV.2 \u2013 Methods 63 \n\nIV.3 \u2013 Laboratory analyses 64 \nIV.3.1 \u2013 Porosity 64 \nIV.3.2 \u2013 Methane, C2+ compounds and sulphate concentration measurements 65 \nIV.3.4 \u2013 Anaerobic oxidation of methane rates 69 \nIV.3.5 \u2013 Biomarker analysis 71 \nIV.3.6 \u2013 Stable carbon isotope analysis 73 \n\nCHAPTER V \u2013 RESULTS 74 \n\nV.1 \u2013 Methane and C2+ hydrocarbons concentrations 74 \nV.1.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 74 \nV.1.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano 75 \nV.1.3 \u2013 Ginsburg mud volcano 75 \nV.1.4 \u2013 No Name mud volcano 75 \nV.1.5 \u2013 Gemini mud volcano 76 \n\nV.2 \u2013 Sulphate concentrations 76 \nV.2.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 76 \n\n\n\n  \n\n17 \n\nV.2.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano 76 \nV.2.3 \u2013 Ginsburg mud volcano 77 \nV.2.4 \u2013 No Name mud volcano 77 \nV.2.5 \u2013 Gemini mud volcano 77 \n\nV.3 \u2013 Sulphate reduction and anaerobic oxidation of methane rates 79 \nV.3.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 79 \nV.3.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano 79 \nV.3.3 \u2013 Ginsburg mud volcano 79 \nV.3.4 \u2013 No Name mud volcano 80 \nV.3.5 \u2013 Gemini mud volcano 80 \n\nV.4 \u2013 Lipid biomarker analysis 81 \nV.4.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 81 \nV.4.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano 82 \nV.4.3 \u2013 Carbonate crusts from the Faro mud volcano 83 \nV.4.4 \u2013 Carbonate crusts from the Hesperides mud volcano 83 \n\nV.5 \u2013 Stable carbon isotope analysis 84 \nV.5.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 84 \nV.5.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano 84 \nV.5.3 \u2013 Faro mud volcano carbonate crusts 84 \nV.5.4 \u2013 Hesperides mud volcano carbonate crusts 85 \n\nV.6 \u2013 Summary of main results 86 \n\nCHAPTER VI \u2013 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 89 \n\nVI.1 - Discussion 89 \n\nVI.2 - Conclusions 93 \n\nAPPENDICES 95 \n\nAppendix I \u2013 Determination of Porosity 95 \n\nAppendix II \u2013 Combustion of 14C-methane to 14C-carbon dioxide 96 \n\nAppendix III \u2013 Biomarker analysis laboratory protocol 98 \n\n\n\n18 \n\nABBREVIATION LIST 101 \n\nREFERENCES 102 \n\nON-LINE REFERENCES 114 \n\nPUBLICATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS ON THE FRAMEWORK \nOF THE PRESENT WORK 115 \n\n \n\n\n\nIInnttrroodduuccttiioonn  \n\n19 \n\n \n\nI.1 \u2013 Nature and scope of this work \n\nMud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz were discovered for the first time in the \n\nMoroccan Sector in 1999, during the TTR-9 cruise coordinated by Dr. Joan Gardner from \n\nthe Naval Research Laboratory (Washington, DC), in the framework of the TTR program, \n\ncoordinated by Prof. Michael Ivanov from the University of Moscow, with the participation \n\nof a Portuguese team from the Marine Geology Department of the Mining and Geology \n\nInstitute and from the Geosciences Department of the University of Aveiro. Since then, the \n\nGulf of Cadiz has been extensively surveyed with geophysical methods and sampling. \n\nSeveral scientific cruises revealed the existence of a large number of fluid escape \n\nstructures and allowed a great advance in the understanding of the tectonic, structural and \n\ngeochemical framework of the area. In 2000, during the TTR-10 cruise (INGMAR project , \n\nPLE/4/98, FCT), the first mud volcanoes in the Portuguese sector were discovered \n\n(Pinheiro et al., in IOC, 2001; Pinheiro et al., 2003). \n\nThe work presented here focuses on anaerobic consumption of methane in marine \n\nsub-surface sediments by a consortium of marine microbes, trough a biogeochemical \n\nprocess known as anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). This process occurs coupled \n\nwith another biogeochemical process: sulphate reduction (SR).  \n\nThe occurrence of AOM is of extreme importance and constitutes an unelectable \n\nsink in the global carbon cycle, because this biogeochemical process interrupts methane \n\nefflux in marine sediments, preventing it from rising to the hydrosphere and, consequently, \n\nto the atmosphere.  \n\nThis work is part of the MVSEIS project: tectonic control, deep crustal structure \n\nand fluid escape pathways in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcano field (01-LEC-EMA24F, \n\nEuropean Science Foundation), an European project coordinated by L.M. Pinheiro. It is \n\nintegrated in one of the project sub-themes: fluid escape pathways in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nThis study was also supported by the Portuguese-German Joint Action: \n\nGeosphere/Biosphere Coupling Processes in the Gulf of Cadiz (Reference: A-15/04 \n\ncoordintaed by A. Boetius and L.M. Pinheiro), which was financed by CRUP (Board of \n\nChapter I \u2013 Introduction \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  II  \n \n\n20 \n\nRectors of the Portuguese Universities) and DAAD (German Academic Exchange \n\nService).  \n\n \n\nI.2 \u2013 Aims of this study \n\nThe main goal of this work is to assess the present state of the biogeochemical \n\nactivity of several mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz, trough the detection, location \n\nand quantification of the biogeochemical process responsible for the consumption of \n\nmethane, which is the most abundant gas in the mud volcanoes sediments from this area. \n\nIt is very important to know the present state of activity of a mud volcano field, due to the \n\nassociated high potential for release of methane as a powerful greenhouse gas. \n\n \n\nThis thesis also addresses several other important questions:  \n\n? What is anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM)? \n\n? What is the relation between anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulphate \n\nreduction (SR)? \n\n? Which are the best methods and tools to study anaerobic oxidation of methane \n\n(AOM)? \n\n? Is anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) occurring in the Gulf of Cadiz mud \n\nvolcanoes sediments? \n\nIf so: \n\n\u00b7 What are the rates at which anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and \n\nsulphate reduction (SR) are occurring in the Gulf of Cadiz? \n\n\u00b7 What is the ratio between anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and \n\nsulphate reduction (SR) in the sub-surface sediments in the Gulf of Cadiz? \n\n\u00b7 Which microorganisms are involved in these processes?  \n\n\u00b7 How significant is the present day mud volcano activity in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\ncompared to other similar systems? \n\n \n\nI.3 \u2013 Database \n\nThe samples used in this work where collected in the Gulf of Cadiz during RV \n\nSO175 cruise, coordinated by Prof. Achim Kopf from the Research Center Ocean Margins \n\n\n\nIInnttrroodduuccttiioonn  \n\n21 \n\nof the University of Bremen - Germany, who gently made the samples available for this \n\nstudy in the framework of the collaboration with the MVSEIS Project. This cruise took \n\nplace on board of the German research vessel SONNE in December 2003.   \n\nThe sediment samples used for biogeochemical analysis where retrieved by TV-\n\nguided multi-coring, and also by gravity coring, in order to obtain longer cores and deeper \n\nsediment samples. These were collected by Vitor Magalh\u00e3es and Helge Niemann, both \n\nPhD students (at the time), who also integrate the Portuguese-German Joint Action A-\n\n15/04 (Boetius/Pinheiro). \n\nThe biogeochemical laboratory analyses were carried out at the Max Planck \n\nInstitute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen \u2013 Germany, under the supervision of Prof. \n\nAntje Boetius and Helge Niemann. \n\nThe geophysical and bathymetric data were provided by the Marine Geophysics \n\nLaboratory of the University of Aveiro and by the Marine Geology Department of the \n\nPortuguese Geological and Mining Institute. \n\n \n\nI.4 \u2013 Methodology \n\nThis work was organized in three main phases. \n\n? Bibliographic research: \n\nThis included a compilation of the published work in an Endnote reference \n\ndatabase and the definition of the state of the art on the following topics: \n\n? Mud volcanism. \n\n? Gulf of Cadiz geology (evolution, tectonics and structure). \n\n? Anaerobic oxidation of methane. \n\n? Sulphate reduction. \n\n? Laboratory procedures used in biogeochemical analysis. \n\n? Laboratory work: \n\nOn March 2004, the laboratory work, which was carried out for a period of \n\napproximately 5 months was started. Initially, geochemical parameters were measured \n\n(methane, sulphate and C2+ compounds). This was followed by, ex situ AOM and SR rate \n\nmeasurements, based on the evidence, given by the geochemical profiles, that methane, \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  II  \n \n\n22 \n\nC2+ compounds and sulphate were being consumed simultaneously at the same depth \n\ninterval. Then, based on these results (geochemical and AOM/SR rate profiles), the \n\nsamples from the studied mud volcanoes that revealed the highest activity based on the \n\ngeochemical profiles (Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes) were chosen for \n\nbiomarker analysis. This type of analysis was used to identify taxonomically the organisms \n\ninvolved in AOM and SR. \n\n? Interpretation and Conclusions: \n\nFinally, all the data obtained from the laboratory work was plotted, interpreted as \n\nwhole and compared with other similar well known systems. The main conclusions were \n\nobtained and the thesis was written. A joint paper was also written and submitted to the \n\ninternational scientific journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (Niemann et al., \n\nsubmitted; Appendix IV: Publications and communications on the framework of the \n\npresent work). \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n23 \n\n \n\nThis chapter gives an overview of some of the key issues and current research \n\nconcerning fluid seepage, biogeochemical processes and methane consumption in marine \n\nsediments.

The basic \n\nmolecules which are at the basis of any organic compound are hydrocarbons, which are \n\ncomposed of carbon and hydrogen. In hydrocarbons, the carbon atoms form the \n\nbackbone of the molecule and the hydrogen atoms are attached to that backbone. There \n\nare three types of hydrocarbons: \n\n? Aromatic hydrocarbons: these, independently of the number of bonds, \nhave at least one aromatic ring, formed by one or more planar sets of six carbon atoms, \n\nconnected by electrons. The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (figure II-1A). \n\n? Saturated hydrocarbons, alkanes or aliphatic hydrocarbons: these do \nnot have any double or triple bond or an aromatic ring. These molecules have the \n\nmaximum possible number of hydrogen atoms, and therefore have no double bonds \n\n(saturated). Methane is an example of a saturated hydrocarbon. Methane molecule has \n\none carbon atom linked to four hydrogen atoms by single bonds (figure II-1B). \n\n? Unsaturated hydrocarbons: these have one or more double (alkenes) or \ntriple bonds (alkynes) between carbon atoms.

It is the main component of natural gas, which is a \n\nmixture of methane and higher hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane, etc.). At room \n\ntemperature, methane is less dense than air. Its solid phase has a melting point at a \n\ntemperature of approximately -182,5 \u00baC and it boils at approximately -161,6 \u00baC; it is \n\ntherefore a gas at room temperature. The methane molecule is non-polar, which explains \n\nits low solubility in water. \n\nOnce in the atmosphere, methane has the capability to absorb terrestrial infrared \n\nradiation that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Therefore, methane is a \n\ngreenhouse gas with the singularity of having a global warming potential 21 times more \n\npowerful than carbon dioxide (CO2). In other words, methane has a much higher ability to \n\ntrap heat in the terrestrial atmosphere than any other gas.  \n\nAccording to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) , since \n\n1750, global averages of atmospheric methane have raised more than 150 percent, from \n\napproximately 700 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) to 1745 ppbv in 1998.

Decomposition of organic wastes (landfills): methane is generated as result of waste \n\ndecomposing under anaerobic conditions.   \n\n? Natural gas / oil exploration and coal mining: methane escapes during production, \n\nprocessing, storage, transmission and distribution of natural gas. This escape may also \n\noccur as a consequence of oil exploitation, because natural gas is usually found in \n\nconnection with oil systems. Therefore, methane emission can be caused by oil \n\nproduction, refinement, transportation and storage. \n\n? Livestock enteric fermentation: several domestic animals, such as ruminants, produce \n\nmethane due to their digestive processes. In the rumen, or in the fore-stomach, \n\nmicrobial fermentation (enteric fermentation) is responsible for the production of \n\nmethane as a by-product of this process. \n\n? Livestock manure management: anaerobic degradation of organic matter in livestock \n\nmanure management systems is also responsible for the emission of methane. \n\n? Sewage treatment: the treatment processes through which municipal wastewater is \n\ncarried out can produce methane if the organic constituents of the sewage are treated \n\nanaerobically. \n\n? Rice cultivation: in these cultures, if the organic matter is decomposed anaerobically in \n\nthe soil, then methane emission to the atmosphere occurs. \n\n \n\nNatural sources of methane \n\n? Wetlands: these provide absolutely anoxic environments with high quantities of organic \n\nmatter. They are favourable habitats for the methane-producing microbes \n\n(methanogens), which produce methane as a result of the decomposition of organic \n\nmatter.  \n\n? Termites and other animals: methane is produced as a product of their digestive \n\nmetabolism.  \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n26 \n\n? Oceans: in marine sediments, in the presence of anaerobic conditions and high \n\namounts of organic matter, methanogens may produce methane.

Gas hydrates have a great importance, because of their \n\npotential exploration as a future energy resource.  Presently, gas hydrates are considered \n\none of the world\u2019s most important and promising future energetic resource. It is estimated \n\nthat carbon resources associated with gas hydrates are more than twice higher than the \n\ncarbon resources associated with other known fossil fuels (Source: U.S. Department of \n\nInterior, U.S.G.S., figure II-3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II-3  Distribution of organic carbon in Earth (excluding dispersed carbon in rocks \nand sediments, which equals nearly 1,000 times this total amount). Numbers in gigatons (1015 tons) \n\nof carbon (Source: U.S. Department of Interior, U.S.G.S.). \n\n \n\nGas hydrates are crystalline solid compounds, consisting of water molecules linked \n\nby hydrogen bridges, forming a \u201ccage\u201d-like structure which traps gas molecules inside.  \n\nThese are ice-like structures, where the geometric arrangement of the water molecules \n\nforms cavities trapping inside the gas molecule (figure II-4). \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II-4  Molecular structure of type I gas hydrates. The small spheres are water \nmolecules forming cages which trap inside large gas molecules (Suess, 2000). \n\n \n\nThese compounds are all also known as \u201cInflammable Ice\u201d, because they become \n\ninflammable in the proximity of a flame. Although there is an absence of chemical linkages \n\nbetween the water and the gas, their structure is very stable and allows this gas not to \n\ndissociate until temperatures much higher than 0 \u00baC are attained, being only necessary \n\nthat the concentration of the gases and the confining pressure are high enough.  \n\nSeveral distinct gas hydrate structures can be formed due to the fact that various \n\ngases have adequate molecular sizes to form hydrates. In Nature there are three types of \n\ngas hydrates (Suess, 2000): \n\n? Type I hydrates, which belong to the cubic crystallization system, are generally formed \n\nof smaller molecules than other types. Type I gas hydrate formers may include: \n\nmethane, ethane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide.  \n\n? Type II hydrates are usually formed of larger molecules than Type I gas hydrates. Type \n\nII gas hydrates also belong to the cubic crystallization system and type II gas hydrate \n\nformers include generally higher hydrocarbon molecules such as propane and \n\nisobutane; however, nitrogen, a relatively small molecule, can also form a Type II \n\nhydrate. \n\n? Type H gas hydrates were discovered more recently. This type of gas hydrates belong \n\nto the hexagonal crystallization system and are formed by larger molecules but only in \n\nthe presence of a smaller molecule, such as methane.  \n\n \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n29 \n\n The most common gas hydrate in nature is methane hydrate, which is found in \n\nhigher quantities along continental margins. These are areas where the formation of \n\nmethane hydrates is favoured by the intense and quick sedimentation and by the high \n\ncontent in organic matter. Gas hydrates, namely methane hydrates, are also found under \n\nthe polar Artic layer at a depth of a few hundred of meters (permafrost regions). \n\nLike the majority of gas hydrates, methane hydrates found at or below seafloor, \n\nmight have a biogenic or a thermogenic origin. The biogenic process is carried out by \n\nmicrobial organisms, through a mechanism where organic matter buried in the bottom of \n\nthe ocean is decomposed by microbes (methanogens), responsible for the production of \n\nmethane (methanogenesis). This methane can form gas hydrates under appropriate \n\npressure and temperature conditions. The thermogenic origin of methane hydrates results \n\nfrom a sequence of stages which include a temperature increase followed by the \n\nprogressive burial of organic-rich sediments. In this case, the decomposition of organic \n\nmaterial occurs due to high temperatures and is not microbilally mediated. This process \n\noccurs usually in sedimentary basins, at a considerable depth and with temperatures \n\nabove 100 \u00baC. Methane hydrates may also form as a consequence of oil degradation at \n\nhigher depths and temperatures, or as result of serpentinization processes at depth which \n\nlead to methane formation. \n\nIt is very important to know whether the gas present in a gas hydrate has a \n\nbiogenic or a thermogenic origin, because this can be indicative of the existence of an oil \n\nsystem in depth. The biogenic gas is known as \u201cdry gas\u201d, consisting almost exclusively of \n\nmethane, whereas thermogenic gas (\u201chumid gas\u201d), is composed of methane and higher \n\nhydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane and higher hydrocarbons. Therefore, \n\nwhen a thermogenic gas is discovered, there is a possibility that it is associated with deep \n\noil reservoirs. \n\nThe ?13C signature of biogenic and thermogenic gas is different, which means that \n\nanalysing the content of stable carbon isotopes is a valuable tool to identify the origin of \n\nthe gas. ?13C value for biogenic gas oscillates between -100 and -80\u2030, whereas \n\nthermogenic gases have a ?13C value between  -40\u2030 and -30\u2030 (Clenell, 2000).  \n\nIn the last two decades, great progresses have occurred in the knowledge of these \n\ngases. The year that marked the turning point in the study of gas hydrates was 1970, \n\nwhen these where found almost accidentally in sediments of Black Outer Ridge (USA), \n\nfollowing the observation of a \u201cBottom Simulating Reflector\u201d (BSR) in seismic refelction \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n30 \n\nprofiles (Markl et al., 1970). These reflectors with negative polarity correspond to the base \n\nof gas hydrates, where free gas is found below. \n\nThe formation of gas hydrates depends on the existence of relatively high gas \n\ncontent, high pressure and low temperatures (Suess, 2000). Moreover, regarding the \n\nparticular case of methane hydrates, one of the factors that interfere with its stability and \n\ndistribution is the solubility of methane in water. Generally, methane solubility in water is \n\nlow, but it may oscillate as a function of the temperature, hydrostatic pressure and \n\nchemistry of the surrounding environment (figure II-5). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II-5  Gas hydrate stabilitity and fase boundaries as a function of depth and \ntemperature. Legend:  (?) phase boundary of pure methane hydrate in five times sea water \n\nsalinity ; (?) phase boundary of pure ethane hydrate at normal seawater salinity ; (?) variation of \n\ntemperature with depth ; (?) phase boundary of methane hydrate with 3 mol-% H2S at seawater \n\nsalinity (from Suess, 2000). \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nVarious indirect seismic tools have been used to study gas hydrates in the field. \n\nThe most commonly used seismic method is seismic reflection, through which it is \n\npossible to identify and map the BSR\u2019s. Seismic wave\u2019s propagation velocity in hydrates is \n\napproximately two times higher than the propagation velocity of these waves in the sea \n\nfloor sediments. It should be noted however, that there are many places where gas \n\nhydrates have been recovered but where there is no evidence of BSR\u2019s. \n\nElectromagnetic methods and electric resistivity have also been used to determine \n\nthe existence of a BSR. These methods measure electric resistivity variations in the \n\nbasement, using electromagnetic waves instead of seismic waves (Sinha et al., 1990). \n\nOther complementary methods include measurement of heat fluxes, since gas \n\nhydrate stability depends strongly on fairly tight pressure and temperature conditions. \n\nThese methods allow a more profound knowledge of the geological and thermal settings \n\ninvolved in the formation of gas hydrates. \n\nRecently, mainly thanks to the Ocean Drilling Programme (ODP) and, more \n\nrecently, to the Integrated Ocean Drilling Programe (IODP), the properties of gas hydrates \n\nhave been intensively studied. Some examples of the main topics which dominate current \n\ngas hydrate-related research are: \n\n? formation of gas hydrate; \n\n? gas hydrate structure; \n\n? influence of gas hydrates in the global biogeochemical cycling; \n\n? gas hydrate relation with tectonic and geological processes; \n\n? gas hydrate related natural hazards. \n\nRegarding this last item, the scientific community has extensively used bathymetric \n\nand geomorphological studies to understand geological hazards related with gas \n\nhydrates, like for example submarine landslides and slope instability. The dissociation of \n\ngas hydrates has a strong influence in the stability/instability of the bottom of the sea by \n\nfluidizing the sediments (Bugge et al., 1988; Baraza et al., 1999; Pecher, 2002). \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n32 \n\nII.3 \u2013 Hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage and fluid escape structures on \ncontinental margins \n\n Areas of past and/or present occurrence of fluid and/or gas escape are dominated \n\nby several diagnostic structures such as mud volcanoes, mud diapirs, carbonate \n\nchimneys, carbonate crusts and pockmarks. The formation of such structures is related to \n\nfluid and/or gas mobilization, generally, from deep sources. \n\nHydrocarbon-rich fluid escape related structures can be distributed in three \n\ndifferent groups, concerning its main features (Kopf, 2002): \n\n? Mud mobilization structures: these include mud diapirs which are structures formed \n\nby mud intrusions and mud volcanoes, the latter involving mud extrusion. \n\n? Authigenic carbonates with distinct geochemical and isotopic signatures which \n\nindicate the involvement of methane in their precipitation. \n\n? Collapse structures, such as pockmarks. \n\nThese structures are often colonized by chemosynthetic communities that depend \n\non the predominant fluids or gases in order to obtain energy for their growth and \n\ndevelopment. Therefore, important biogeochemical processes occur in fluid seepage \n\nareas, making these regions particularly important for the understanding of \n\nbiogeochemical cycles.  \n\nSome of the main features in fluid/gas seepage areas, as well as the main \n\nmicrobial mediated biogeochemical processes, will be described further on in a latter \n\nsection of this chapter. \n\n \n\nII.3.1 \u2013 Mud volcanoes and mud diapirs \n\nMud volcanoes are geologic structures formed as result of the extrusion of a \n\nmixture of gas, water and clay material at the Earth\u2019s terrestrial surface (Dimitrov, 2003). \n\nThese form topographic elevations that can be found almost everywhere on Earth surface, \n\nboth on land and in the bottom of the oceans (figure II-6).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n33 \n\n      \n\n1 Aleutian Trench, Alaska margin: Coper River 23 Romania \n2 British Columbia, Canada 24 Tanzania/East Africa \n3 Cascadia (Oregon, Washington) 25 Black Sea, Kerch and Crimea Penuinsulas \n4 California, Nevada 26 Caucasus (Taman, Georgia, Azerbeijan) \n5 Mexico, Gulf of Mexico 27 Caspian Sea \n6 TexAS, Mississipi, Louisiana 28 Iran, Turkmenistan \n7 Lake Michigan 29 Makran and Pakistan \n8 Costa Rica 30 India \n9 Colombia 31 Burma \n\n10 Ecuador 32 Sumatra, Java \n11 Barbados 33 Borneo, Brunel, Sabah/Malaysia \n12 Venezuela and Trinidad 34 Central Australia (Gosses Bluff) \n13 Greenland, Northa Atlantic 35 Timor-Ceram Arc \n14 Morocco/North Africa 36 Irian Rays, Papua New Guinea \n15 Gulf of Cadiz/Alboran 37 Taiwan \n\n16 Barents Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea \n38 Ryukyu Trench, Nakai, Japan Trench, \n\nJapar \n17 Alboran Sea 39 Sakhalin island/Sea of Ochotsk \n18 Western Alps, Appenines/Italy 40 Marianas \n19 Sicily 41 Australia \n20 Peleponnesus/Greece, Adriatic Sea 42 New Zeland \n21 Aegean Sea 43 Lybian Desert, Egypt \n22 Eastern Mediterranean Sea 44 Netherlands \n\n \n\nFigure II-6   Distribution of mud volcanoes on the Earth\u2019s surface. The red dot indicates the \nlocalization of the Gulf of Cadiz (after Kopf 2000). \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n34 \n\n \n\nMud volcanism involves the dislocation through sediments of mud breccia (a fine \n\ngrained matrix of muddy sediments, water and gases, with rock fragments) followed by its \n\nextrusion.  \n\nOn the other hand, mud diapirs are characterized by the intrusion of mud into \n\nsedimentary layers not followed by its extrusion at the surface. Hence, mud volcanism is \n\nconsidered an extrusive phenomenon whereas mud diapirism is considered intrusive. \n\nBesides mud volcanoes and mud diapirs, other types of structures: can be \n\ndistinguished: diatremes. These are similar to mud diapirs but while in mud diapirs the \n\nmud behaves as a single-phase viscous fluid, in diatremes the flow of water and/or gas \n\ntrough sediments causes fluidization (Kopf, 2000). Figure II-7 represents an illustrative \n\ndiagram of the three types of structures, as proposed by Kopf (2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFluid sources for overpressuring and mud extrusion: \n\n(1) pore fluids expulsion from compaction; \n(2) biogenic methane from degradation of organic matter; \n(3) lateral fluid flux through statigraphic horizons or fault zones; \n(4) fluid migration along deep seated thrusts; \n(5) thermogenic methane and higher hydrocarbons; \n(6) fluids from mineral dehydration (opal, smectite); \n(7) hydrothermal fluids, alteration of crustal rock; \n(8) fluid expulsion from internal deformation within the diapiric intrusion. \n\n \n\nFigure II-7  Schematic diagram illustrating mud diapirs, mud volcanoes and diatremes \n(Kopf, 2000).

The ocean basin where more mud volcanoes \n\nhave been reported so far is the Mediterranean Sea (Kopf, 2002). However, this is \n\nprobably mainly due to the absence of equally detailed studies in other continental \n\nmargins. \n\nSeveral facts make the understanding of mud volcanism extremely important. \n\nMilkov et al. (2000) made a compilation of such facts: \n\n? these structures are important methane sources to the hydrosphere and atmosphere; \n\n? mud volcanoes may constitute an evidence of the existence of oil reservoirs in depth; \n\n? analysing the material extruded from mud volcanoes may provide important data \n\nregarding the sedimentary history of the underlying basin geology; \n\n? gas hydrates related with these structures may be used in the future as an important \n\nenergy source. \n\n \n\nII.3.2 \u2013 Authigenic methane-related carbonate crusts and chimneys \n\nIn fluid and/or gas escape dominated areas, methane-derived authigenic \n\ncarbonates (MDAC), forming structures such as chimneys (figure II-8), mounds or crusts \n\nare frequently found. The lithology of these structures is dominated by calcite, and/or \n\naragonite, and/or dolomite. These structures are found all over the world in association \n\nwith mud volcanoes and mud diapiric fields in accretionary margins. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe origin of these structures is still a matter of debate and several groups of researchers \n\nhave been focusing on understanding the mechanism of their formation (Vasconcelos et \n\nal., 1995; Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997; Stakes et al., 1999; Aloisi et al., 2000, D\u00edaz-\n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n36 \n\ndel-Rio et al., 2003). There is however a general agreement that they correspond to \n\ncarbonated-cemented fluid venting pathways, where the precipitation of carbonates \n\noccurs, most likely related with microbial activity associated to AOM. This has been \n\nconfirmed by the detection of low ?13C values suggesting the incorporation of carbon \n\nderiving from methane oxidation. \n\nOne of the major breakthroughs in the understanding of the formation and \n\nprecipitation of authigenic dolomite was carried out by Vasconcelos et al. (1995), who \n\nwere able to precipitate dolomite in the laboratory at low temperatures, under the \n\nmediation of microbes. \n\n \n\nII.3.3 \u2013 Pockmarks \n\nThese are seabed collapse structures that look like buried craters. These \n\nstructures are common in hydrocarbon-rich fluid escape related areas, but also in other \n\nareas such as compressional areas. Pockmarks are formed by tectonical collapse or by \n\nthe removal of sediment by escaping fluids (Hovland and Judd, 1988). \n\n \n\nII.4 \u2013 Microbial-related biogeochemical processes in marine sediments \n\nThere are several chemical alterations occurring in marine sediments and in the \n\nsubjacent water column that are mediated by microbes. The most relevant processes \n\ndiscussed in this work are: sulphate reduction, methanogenesis, aerobic oxidation of \n\nmethane and anaerobic oxidation of methane. The most commonly observed chemical \n\nalterations that occur in sediment pore water or in the water column in the proximity of \n\ncold seeps are (Aharon, P. in Riding and Awramik, 2000): \n\n? decrease of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and methane (CH4) due to microbial activity; \n\n? depletion of carbon dioxide (CO2) related with microbial metabolism; \n\n? enrichment in carbon dioxide caused by the respiration of methanotrophs, leading to \n\nthe increase of dissolved organic carbon, decrease of pH and negative variations of \n\n?13C. \n\n \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n37 \n\nII.4.1 \u2013 Sulphate Reduction \n\nIn the proximity of cold seep sediments, it is frequently detected an accentuated \n\ndepletion in sulphate associated with enrichment in reduced sulphur compounds, namely \n\nhydrogen sulphide. This enrichment is provoked by the anaerobic reduction of sulphate \n\nthat occurs in the anoxic pore water and results from the anaerobic respiration of bacteria \n\nsubsisting in anoxic sediments of seeps. \n\nAs a result of sulphate reduction, several metabolic products are generated and \n\nreleased into the interstitial fluids. Besides hydrogen sulphide, carbonate, ammonium and \n\nother compounds are also produced, whose concentrations and types depend on the type \n\nof substrate present. \n\nThe following equations show an example of the chemical reactions involved in the \n\nmicrobial reduction of sulphate using methane, a saturated hydrocarbon, as a substrate: \n\n-\n22\n\n-2\n44 2OHSHCOSOCH ++?+       (II-1) \n\nSHCO2OHCO 2\n2\n3\n\n-\n2 +?+\n\n?        (II-2) \n\nAharon (in Riding and Awramik, 2000) presented a study on the ratio \n\nsulphate/sulphide in cold seep pore waters from the northern Gulf of Mexico. This author \n\nshowed that this ratio is linear, which indicates that the sulphate reduction is actually \n\neffective in the sediments from this area. \n\n \n\nII.4.2 \u2013 Methanogenesis \n\nMethanogenic microorganisms are commonly found in anoxic sediments \n\nsurrounding cold seeps. Methanogens have specific carbon sources and usually form \n\nconsortia with other microorganisms in order to obtain the compounds necessary for their \n\ngrowth and development. This syntrophic relation is common in bacteria, which initially \n\nconvert organic substrates into metabolites, vital to methanogens to carry out \n\nmethanogenesis. The metabolites used by methanogens as intermediates in order to form \n\nmethane are still largely unknown. Nevertheless, several studies have pointed out that \n\nacetate and hydrogen are two possible candidates. In a first stage, bacteria transform the \n\norganic substrates producing an intermediate (acetate, hydrogen or other) which is used \n\nlatter in the production of methane by methanogens. Equation II-3 shows the chemical \n\nequation on the base of the formation of acetate and hydrogen by bacteria: \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n38 \n\n22322 2HCOOOHCHOHO3CH ++?+    (II-3) \n\n \n\nSubsequently, the formation of methane is a result of anaerobic respiration of \n\nmethanogenic organisms, showed by the following equations: \n\n243 COCHOOHCH +?        (II-4) \n\nO2HCOH4 222 ?+         (II-5) \n\nMethanogens have the particular characteristic of living in the most extreme \n\nenvironments. These unicellular organisms are strict anaerobes that release methane as \n\na consequence of their cellular metabolism.  Originally, they were thought to be bacteria \n\nbut they are now recognized as belonging to a separate philogenetic domain, the \n\nArchaea. This domain contains several phylum, but the two most prominent are the \n\nEuryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeota. Methanogens belong to the Euryarchaeota. \n\nMethanogens are also found in extreme environments, like hydrothermal vents, \n\nwhere they succeed at temperatures above 100 \u00baC. Methanogens produce approximately \n\n109 tons of methane per year. About half of this is reoxidized by methanotrophic \n\norganisms and most of the rest escapes to the atmosphere. The main requests for the \n\noccurrence of methanogenesis are the absence of reducer compounds, such as sulphate, \n\nand the abundance of organic matter. \n\nArchaea are also capable of reoxidizing methane under anoxic conditions as it will \n\nbe shown in section II.4.4. \n\n \n\nII.4.3 \u2013 Aerobic oxidation of methane \n\nAt methane-rich cold seeps, the methane fraction which escapes to the oxic water \n\ncolumn is oxidized to carbon dioxide by aerobic methanotrophs. These microbes live in \n\nsymbiosis with organisms that colonize seeps, living, for example, on mussel gills. About \n\n30% of the methanotrophs living in cold seeps use carbon dioxide as a carbon source \n\n(Aharon, 2000) \n\nThe organisms that mediate aerobic oxidation of methane are chemolithotrophs \n\nand obligate aerobes. Therefore, these organisms need molecular oxygen in order to \n\noxidize methane. \n\nacetate \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n39 \n\nThe aerobic oxidation of methane is a well-known process, where oxygen is the \n\nelectron donor, and it is described by the following equation: \n\nOH2CO2OCH 2224 +?+        (II-6) \n\nHowever, the aerobic oxidation of methane is a process that consists of a net of \n\nchemical reactions, which sequentially oxidize methane to methanol (via \n\nmonooxygenase), subsequently to formaldehyde (via dehydrogenase), then to formate \n\n(via formaldehyde dehydrogenase) and finally to carbon dioxide (via formate \n\ndehydrogenase). \n\n \n\nII.4.4 \u2013 Aerobic sulphide oxidation \n\nIn the proximity of seeps there are also evidences of the occurrence of another \n\nimportant chemical reaction: sulphide oxidation. This process is mediated by sulphide \n\noxidizing bacteria, mainly Beggiatoa. These bacteria live in the sediment-water interface \n\nand use the energy resulting from the oxidation of sulphide to produce carbon dioxide. In \n\nthis process, oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor and sulphur is also produced. This \n\ncompound may form small grains on the external face of the cytoplasmatic membrane. \n\nThe following equation describes the sulphide oxidation: \n\nOH2SO21SH 222 +?+        (II-7) \n\n \n\nII.4.5 \u2013 Anaerobic oxidation of methane \n\nThe existence of methane reservoirs in continental margins around the world, \n\nmainly under the shape of methane hydrates, is being intensively investigated at present. \n\nStill, only a small fraction of this huge amount of methane is probably escaping from the \n\nanoxic marine sediments to the water column and to the atmosphere. \n\nIn the last decade, several studies have been concerned with methane \n\nconsumption in the marine sediments and it is now consensually accepted that the \n\nprocess responsible for the consumption of methane in the sediments, before it escapes \n\nto the water column, is microbially mediated. \n\nKnowing the properties of methane as a greenhouse gas, knowing the effects of \n\nan eventual release of great amounts of methane from the oceanic sea floor to the \n\natmosphere and taking into account that methane is a possible energy source for the near \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n40 \n\nfuture, a considerable attention has been given to the processes that may block methane \n\nrelease to the atmosphere. \n\nThe microbes that take part of methane production and consumption occupy an \n\nimportant link in the global carbon cycle, either because the existing methane has a \n\nbiogenic origin, as it was explained before in this work, or because certain microbes are \n\nable to consume methane under anaerobic conditions in marine sediments. Therefore, \n\nmethane trapped in the form of gas hydrate can be released by diffusion, by ebullition or \n\ncan be oxidized by methane oxidizing microbes. Thus, in the carbon cycle, there is the \n\ninterference of methane producing and of methane consuming microbes (methanogens \n\nand methanotrophs, respectively). \n\nAnaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) has been largely studied in the past 30 \n\nyears. The first authors to study AOM were Martens and Berner (1974), who suggested \n\nthat this process could explain the typical downwards decreasing of sulphate profiles \n\ncoupled to upward decreasing methane profiles observed in marine sediments. Since \n\n1974, several authors have done considerable work on this topic. \n\nPresently, there are several hypotheses to explain methane oxidation under anoxic \n\nconditions, but the most accepted is that methane is oxidized by a microbial organism in \n\nassociation with sulphate reducing bacteria, presuming that an unknown compound is \n\nused as an electron transporter between both organisms intervening in the process. \n\nOne of the most important studies regarding this issue was carried out by Boetius \n\net al. (2000). This study was carried out in sediments obtained from core samples \n\nrecovered from the Cascadia convergent margin, off Oregon (USA), where gas hydrates \n\nwere found at a depth between 600 and 800 m bsf. A downward depletion of sulphate in \n\nthe Cascadia margin sediments was observed, simultaneously with upward methane \n\ndepletion. Boetius et al. (2000) suggested that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) \n\noccurring in the anoxic marine sediments, is mediated by a consortium of Archaea, which \n\nare methanotrophs, and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). These authors also proposed \n\nthat Archaea reverse the methanogenesis process due to the interaction with sulphate \n\nreducing bacteria (figure II-9). This had previously been suggested by Zehnder and Brock \n\n(1979; 1980) who proposed for the first time that this process should occur in two steps: \n\nfirst, Archaea work in reverse and transform methane into intermediates (e.g. methanol or \n\nacetate); afterwards, the intermediates are oxidized by sulphate reducing bacteria into \n\nCO2 through sulphate reduction.  \n\n \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n41 \n\n \n\nFigure II-9  Methane and sulphate concentration profiles in anoxic marine sediments. The \nsulphate-methane interface is the horizon of intersection of sulphate and methane profiles, both \n\nwith minimum values. The inset shows the spatial arrangement and potential metabolic couplings \n\nof the microbial consortium reported by Boetius et al., 2000 (DeLong, 2000). \n\n \n\nSulphate reduction is mainly performed by several groups of delta proteobacteria \n\nlike Desulfosarcina (DSS), Desulfonema and Desulfococus (Madigan et al., 2000). These \n\norganisms may use different electron donors such as hydrogen, acetate and lactate \n\n(Treude, 2003).  \n\nThe general reaction for sulphate reduction is: \n\nSH2HCOSOO2CH 2\n-\n3\n\n-2\n42 +?+       (II-8) \n\nAOM is the process that allows methane to be consumed under anoxic conditions, \n\nusing sulphate as terminal electron acceptor. The equation descibing AOM is the \n\nfollowing: \n\nOHHSHCOSOCH 2\n--\n\n3\n-2\n\n44 ++?+       (II-9) \n\nAs mentioned before, this is a two-step coupled mechanism performed by \n\nmethane oxidizers and sulphate reducers. Still, it is not yet known which metabolites \n\n(intermediates) are exchanged between both organisms. Some, have been proposed by \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n42 \n\nseveral authors, like hydrogen or acetate. In the following chemical reaction, hydrogen is \n\nused as an intermediate (Thomsen et al., 2001): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHence, it is possible to conclude that sulphate reduction is supported by ascending \n\nfluxes of methane. \n\nOne product of AOM is sulphide, which results of sulphate reduction and \n\naccumulates in similar concentrations to the consumed sulphate. This explains the \n\npresence of considerable amounts of sulphide-oxidizing bacteria, forming mats in the \n\nsurrounding sediments, like for e.g. Beggiatoa. \n\nBoetius et al. (2000) complemented the work on the Cascadia margin sediments \n\nwith Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) and molecular studies, which enabled to \n\nshow microscopic evidences of the existence of the Archaea-Bacteria consortium. This \n\nwas an important step in the study of AOM and it was the first time that the existence of \n\nAOM-consortia was shown by microscopic studies. \n\nThe FISH techniques carried out by Boetius and co-workers allowed the detection \n\nof cellular aggregates in sites where methane escape was observed. These aggregates \n\nwere described as consortia of Archaea and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB), forming a \n\nsphere with 2,3 \u00b1 1,3 \u00b5m. The Archaea appear surrounded by approximately 200 SRB\u2019s, \n\nwith an average diameter of 0,3 \u00b1 0,5 \u00b5m, forming an external \u201cshell\u201d with one or two \n\nlayers of cells. In total, the consortium diameter ranges between 1 and 11 \u00b5m (figure II-\n\n10). The smallest aggregates found consist only of 1-3 cells of Archaea and 1-3 cells of \n\nSRB\u2019s and should correspond to the initial stages of development, whereas the most \n\ndeveloped ones consisted of about 10 000 cells. \n\nMethane oxidation 1st: 2224 COH4OH2CH +?+     (II-10) \n\n \n\nSulphate reduction 2nd: OH4HSSOH4H 2\n--2\n\n42 +?++\n+    (II-11) \n\n \n\nThe global AOM reaction: \n\nOHHSHCOSOCH 2\n--\n\n3\n-2\n\n44 ++?+     (II-12) \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n43 \n\nAfter philogenetic analyses, Boetius and co-workers became aware that the \n\nArchaea present in the aggregates found in Cascadia margin sediments are related to the \n\nmethanogenic order Methanosarcinales.

This section briefly explains how each tool can be used \n\nto study this process. \n\n \n\nII.4.6.1 - Geochemical parameters \n\nTaking into consideration that AOM is a two-step reaction involving methane \n\noxidation and sulphate reduction and that this last process produces sulphide, it is \n\npossible to have an evidence of this process by simultaneously measuring methane, \n\nsulphate and sulphide concentrations at a depth interval. Methane and sulphate \n\nmeasurement results, plotted together, allow the detection of a possible sulphate-methane \n\ntransition zone (SMTZ) (figure II-11 and II-12). \n\n5 \u00b5m \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIII  \n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSulphide, as referred previously, is a product of sulphate reduction and can be \n\nindicative of the occurrence of AOM coupled to SR in marine sediments. Therefore, this \n\nparameter is frequently measured when scientists are looking for evidences of AOM. \n\n \n\nII.4.6.2 \u2013 Radiotracer Measurements \n\nRadiotracer measurements allow the quantification of AOM and SR rates (Devol, \n\n1983; Iversen and Blackburn, 1981; Iversen and Jorgensen, 1985). This technique \n\nconsists of adding radiotracers to the sediments, in order to measure their conversion into \n\nknown products and quantify the turnover rate. In the case of AOM, the tracer used is \n14CH4 and in the case of SR the tracer is 35SO42-. By using these radiotracers and knowing \n\nthe total methane and sulphate concentration in the sediments, as well as the \n\nconcentration of the produced 14CO2 and H235S, it is possible to calculate the turnover \n\nFigure II-11   CH4 and SO4 profiles from the \nH\u00e5kon Mosby mud volcano situated in the \n\nsouthern Norwegian Sea, northwest off \n\nNorway (Niemann, Unpublished 2004).

For example, carbon, which is the basic constituent of organic matter, plays an \n\nimportant role in several atmospheric, ecological and biogeochemical processes. \n\nTherefore, through the  analysis of stable carbon isotopic composition of lipid biomarkers, \n\nit is possible to get information on the carbon source and/or metabolic carbon fixation \n\npathways used by its producer (Treude, 2003). \n\nIn the case of AOM and SR, by analysing the carbon isotope composition of \n\narchaeal and bacterial related biomarkers, a better understanding of their metabolism and \n\ncarbon source can be obtained. \n\n\n\nFFlluuiidd  sseeeeppaaggee  aanndd  bbiiooggeeoocchheemmiiccaall  pprroocceesssseess  oonn  ccoonnttiinneennttaall  mmaarrggiinnss  \n\n49 \n\nDuring microbial oxidation of methane, the lighter 12C isotope is preferentially \n\nconsumed and therefore the heavier 13C isotope becomes enriched in the remaining \n\ndissolved methane. This enrichment in light 12C in microbes, discriminating from the \n\nheavier 13C substrate occurs because of a slower reactivity of the heavier molecule. This \n\nprocess is called kinetic isotope fractionation.  \n\nThe ratio between 12C and 13C is generally given in comparison with a known \n\nstandard (the Viena Pee Dee Belemnite \u2013 VPDB) and is represented by the expression \n\n?13C. The VDPB standard corresponds to the carbon contained in the calcium carbonate \n\nof a marine fossil denominated Pee Dee Belemnite, which belongs to a geological \n\nformation, in North Carolina (USA), of Cretaceous age, whose value was established by \n\nthe International Agency for Atomic Energy, with headquarters in Vienna. \n\n \n\nThis isotope ratio is given by the following equation. \n\n1000\nCC/\n\nCC/CC/\nC\n\nstandard\n1312\n\nstandard\n1312\n\nsample\n1312\n\nsample\n13 \u00d7\n\n?\n=?

It has had a complex tectonic history with several episodes of extension, \n\nstrike-slip and compression related to the closure of the Thetys Ocean, the opening of the \n\nNorth Atlantic, and the Africa-Eurasia convergence since the Cenozoic. The Gibraltar Arc \n\nis the westernmost tectonic belt of the Alpine-Mediterranean compressional system \n\n(Maldonado et al., 1999). \n\nDuring the Mesozoic and beginning of the Cenozoic, several half-graben basins \n\nand carbonated platforms were formed (Maldonado et al., 1999). During the Tortonian, \n\noccured the westward migration of the Gibraltar Arc, leading to the formation of an \n\naccretionary prism and the formation of a large olistrostome body related with sediment \n\nlandslides and with intense deformation of sediments from the Iberic and African margins \n\n(Maldonado and Comas, 1992; Maldonado et al., 1999). This olistrostome complex was \n\nemplaced over the arcuate thrusts related to the formation of the Gibraltar Arc (Maldonado \n\nand Comas, 1992; Maldonado and Nelson, 1999; Maldonado et al., 1999; Somoza et al., \n\n2003). \n\nThe four main tectonic allochtonous provinces that surround the internal zones of \n\nthe Gibraltar Arc orogenic belt include (figure III-1): \n\na) flysch unites of the Campo de Gibraltar; \n\nb) a detached Mesozoic sedimentary basin at the external zones, ranging \n\nfrom Lower Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous-Paleocen pre-units; \n\nc) the Triassic diapiric zone, composed of salt, gypsum and carbonate \n\ndeposits emplaced as diapiric structures by thrusting of thick nappes of Mesozoic \n\nsediments; \n\nd) the front of a deformed wedge, mainly formed by clastic clays and marls of \n\nEarly-Middle Miocene age . \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIIIII  \n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III-1  Geological setting and simplified bathymetry of the Gulf of Cadiz and \nsurrounding areas.

The focal mechanism \n\nsolutions of the main seismic events in this area indicate a combination of dextral strike-\n\nslip along the African-Eurasian plate boundary, and an approximately NW or WNW \n\n\n\nCChhaarraacctteerriizzaattiioonn  ooff  tthhee  SSttuuddyy  AArreeaa  \n\n55 \n\ndirected compression associated with the African and Eurasian convergence since the \n\nCenozoic (Udias et al., 1976; Zitellini et al., 1999). \n\nThe main oceanographic feature of the Gulf of Cadiz is the existence of the \n\nMediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), which occurs as a warm and saline high velocity \n\nbottom current, revealed by a high density contrast between the westward Mediterranean \n\nwater and the lighter eastward North Atlantic water (Baringer and Price, 1999). In the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz region the MOW travels along the continental slope in a E-W direction and \n\ninflects towards the North at Cape St. Vicent \n\n \n\nIII.2 \u2013 The Gulf of Cadiz Mud Volcano Field \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz has been intensely surveyed with geophysical methods and \n\nsampling, since the discovery of the first mud volcanoes in this area, in 1999, during the \n\nTTR-9 cruise Leg 2 (Akhmanov et al., 2000 in Kenyon et al., 2000;Gardner 2000; 2001).  \n\nNumerous fluid escape structures were revealed on a sidescan sonar mosaic (SEABEAM) \n\nacquired in this area in 1992 by the Naval Research Laboratory (Pinheiro et al., 2003). \n\nThe methods used to investigate this area include reflection seismics, side-scan sonar, \n\nheat-flow, underwater TV and coring. Subsequently, these structures have been \n\ninvestigated and were confirmed to be mud volcanoes, mud diapirs and pockmarks. The \n\nfirst discovered mud volcano was given the designation of Yuma and is situated in the \n\nMoroccan margin.  \n\nMud volcanism is a common feature in accretionary complex areas where gas-rich \n\nsediments are overpressured at depth due to intense tectonic stresses, and where fluid \n\nmigration appears to be controlled by structural factors. Indeed, in the Gulf of Cadiz, some \n\nof the mud volcanoes appear to occur along NW-SE strike-slip faults and their conjugate \n\nset, in particular at the intersection of these structures with the arcuate thrusts associated \n\nwith the Gibraltar Arc (Pinheiro et al., 2003).  \n\nSince the first expedition in 1999, several gas and fluid seepage related structures \n\nhave been discovered in the Gulf of Cadiz, in Portuguese, Moroccan and Spanish \n\nterritories. Untill now, 34 mud volcanoes were discovered, as well as an extensive field of \n\nauthigenic carbonate chimneys and crusts and pockmarks (D\u00edaz-del-Rio et al., 2003, \n\nPinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Pinheiro, pers. com.)

This campaign was entitled GAP \n\n(Gibraltar Arc Processes). It resulted in a multidisplinary investigation of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\narea, in which participated an international group of researchers (Kopf and Participants, \n\n2004). A wide range of methods were applied in this expedition, which included: \n\n? geophysical data aquisistion (seafloor multibeam bathymetry, side scan sonar, seismic \n\nreflection profiling); \n\n\n\nCChhaarraacctteerriizzaattiioonn  ooff  tthhee  SSttuuddyy  AArreeaa  \n\n57 \n\n? sediment coring at sites of active fluid venting; \n\n? in situ heat flow measurements across the Gibraltar thrust wedge, deformation front, \n\nlandslide bodies and mud volcanoes; \n\n? deployment of  long term pressure probes; \n\n? video-supported observations. \n\nThe SO175 campaign, aimed to interconnect geological, geophysical, \n\noceanographic, biogeochemical and microbiological data in order to get a good overall \n\npicture of this region, giving special attention to active fluid venting-related processes, as \n\nwell as to contribute to the study of the possible sources of 1755 Lisbon earthquake, one \n\nof the most destructive earthquakes in Europe history, which occurred with a magnitude of \n\napproximately 8.5-9.0.  \n\n \n\nIII.4 \u2013 Mud volcanoes studied in the present work \n\nThe mud volcanoes which were the object of the present study are: Captain \n\nArutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, No Name, Gemini, Faro and Hesperides.

Its \n\ndiameter is approximately 2 km and its height is about 100 m (table III-1 and figure III-3) \n\n(Pinheiro et al. in Kenyon et al., 2001; 2003). \n\nData recovered from cruises previous to the GAP cruise (TTR-12; Peralta et al. in \n\nKenyon et al., 2002) included samples of strongly gas hydrate saturated mud breccia with \n\na strong H2S smell. During the TTR-12 cruise were also found biological assemblages \n\nassociated with methane flux (Pogonophora, Polychaete and Solemyidae shell fragment \n\nat Captain Arutyunov\u2019s sediments.  \n\nDuring the GAP cruise, the sediment cores recovered show oxic horizons in the \n\nfirst 8 cm, then a suboxic layer.

On the other hand, \n\nthe TV-guided observations of Bonjardim mud volcano during the GAP cruise did not \n\nshow any evidence of chemosynthetic organisms. The recovery of the sediment cores \n\nallowed the detection of an oxic layer in the top 25 cm of the core, followed by an anoxic \n\nhorizon.

It is located in \n\nthe Moroccan margin, in the southern Gulf of Cadiz, just south of the Yuma mud volcano. \n\nThis mud volcano is about 4 km in diameter, rises 150-250 m above the seafloor and it is \n\none of the first active methane-related mud volcanoes identified in this region. During the \n\nTTR-10 cruise (2000), ice-like gas hydrate crystals up to 5 cm in size were recovered from \n\nthis mud volcano (Kenyon et al., 2001; Pinheiro et al., 2003). \n\nThe TV-guided observations carried out during the GAP cruise detected a \n\ndominant lithology of hemipelagic sediments with rare occurrence of carbonates or \n\nisolated patches with coral fragments. Throughout the whole core, sediments were \n\nstrongly bioturbated, it was detected a slightly H2S and petroleum smell and the sediment \n\nwas full of gas.  \n\nA B\n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIIIII  \n\n60 \n\nIII.4.4 \u2013 Gemini mud volcano  \n\nThis is a large mud volcano (figure III-5), situated in the El Arraiche mud volcano \n\nfield in the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz, discovered during the Cadipor cruise. \n\nThis structure is composed of two separate circular craters; the eastern crater is the \n\nlargest one (Kenyon et al., 2003). This twin mud volcano is 252 m high and the water \n\ndepth of its top is approximately 400 m; the base of the mud volcano is 2.3 km long and \n\n4.1 km wide  (Pieter Van Rensenberg, 2005).  \n\nDuring the RV Belgica campaign which occurred in May 2002, highly gas-\n\nsaturated mud breccia, with a strong H2S smell was recovered from Gemini mud volcano \n\n(Pieter Van Rensenberg, 2005) and it was not found hemi-pelagic sediment.

The laboratory \n\nanalyses carried out in this work were: \n\ni) Geochemical measurements: methane, C2+ compounds and sulphate. The main \ngoal was to identify the horizon in the sediment where the main biogeochemical \n\nprocesses occur. Since the main interest of this work is to study the occurrence of \n\nAOM in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes\u2019 sediments, methane and sulphate \n\nconcentration measurements were carried out, and the corresponding \n\ngeochemical profiles were obtained. \n\nii) SR and AOM rate calculations were done in order to understand the extent to \nwhich these microbial-mediated processes occur in the sediments. \n\niii) Lipid biomarker analysis, which is based on the fact that lipid fractions are \npreserved in the sediment, was also done. Lipids were extracted and analysed. \n\nThese gave an indication of the organisms involved, distinguishing between \n\nBacteria and Archaea. \n\niv) Stable carbon isotope analysis was done on the lipid fraction and provided \ninformation about the carbon source incorporated by the microorganisms. \n\n \n\nThe geochemical parameters determined and the laboratory procedures carried \n\nout for each station are presented in table IV-2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIVV  \n\n64 \n\nStructure \nname      \n\nMeasurments \n\nCaptain \nArutyunov \n(9036-2 and \n\n9041-1) \n\nBonjardim \n(9051-1) \n\nBonjardim \n(9051-2) \n\nGinsburg \n(9061-1) \n\nNo \nName \n\n(9063-1)\n\nGemini \n(9067-1) \n\nHesperides \n(9024) \n\nFaro \n(9029-3)\n\nPorosity X X X X X X     \n\nMethane \nconcentration \n\nX X X X X X   \n\nC2+ \nhydrocarbon \n\nX X X      \n\nSulphate \nconcentration \n\nX X X X X X   \n\nSR rates X X X X X X   \n\nAOM rates X X X X X X   \nLipid \nbiomarkers \n\nX X     X X \n\n?13C X X         X X \n\n \nTable IV-2   Measurements carried out in this work. \n \n \n \n\nIV.3 \u2013 Laboratory analyses \n\n \n\nIV.3.1 \u2013 Porosity \n\nFor each station, 5 ml sediment samples were taken for porosity and density \n\ndetermination. First, the wet weigh of the sample was registered. Then the sediment was \n\ndried in an oven for two days at 90\u00baC, and then the dry weight of the sample was also \n\nregistered. This procedure was done with the sediment sample inside a known weight \n\nrecipient. Afterwards, the calculation of the weight of the pore water was done by \n\nsubtracting the dry weight to the wet weight of the sample.  This way, it was possible to \n\nknow the volume of pore water per volume of wet weight, by dividing the amount of pore \n\nwater, already known, by the weight of wet sediment.  Finally, the porosity and density of \n\nthe sample were calculated using the following two equations: \n\n \n\nPorosity (ml/ml) = volume of pore water / volume of wet sediment  (IV-1) \n\nDensity (g/ml) = weight of wet sediment / volume of wet sediment  (IV-2) \n\n \n\nThe calculation of these two parameters is necessary for further measurements, \n\nsuch as determining methane and sulphate concentrations.

In this study, both methane and sulphate concentrations were \n\nmeasured in samples recovered at several depths from the Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim, \n\nGinsburg, No Name and Gemini mud volcanoes. \n\nIn order to obtain the precise determination of the sediment volume, a 5 ml \n\nsediment sample was taken using a cut-off syringe. Afterwards, the excess of sediment \n\nwas removed from the open end of the syringe. \n\nFor methane and C2+ compounds concentration measurements, the sediment \n\nsamples were stored in the syringes and afterwards were extruded into two types of glass \n\nserum vials with two different volumes (24,24 ml and 21,26 ml). Then, in order to \n\nterminate any remaining bacterial activity, 7 ml of NaOH was added to the sediment \n\nsample contained in the glass serum vials. Finally, the vial was immediately capped with a \n\nrubber septum and an aluminium crimp seal and vigorously shaken in order to equilibrate \n\nthe pore water methane within the headspace.  \n\nMethane concentration in the headspace was measured by Gas Chromatography \n\n(GC), by injecting 100 \u00b5l of headspace using a syringe with the same volume. The \n\nequipment used was a gas chromatograph (5890A, Hewlett Packard), equipped with \n\npacked stainless steal Porapak-Q column and a flame ionization detector. Helium was \n\nused as carrier gas. The gas peaks were then integrated by an integrator.  \n\nThe methane concentration in the headspace was calculated from the integrated \n\narea of the methane peak by comparison with a standard curve obtained previously, \n\nbased on 100 ppmV and 1000 ppmV methane standards. The pore water methane \n\nconcentration was then calculated. \n\nFor sulphate concentration measurements, sediment samples were taken with a \n\ncut-off syringe, transferred into plastic tubes and fixed with zinc chloride (ZnCl2), in order \n\nto fix the dissolved sulphide and to prevent further oxidation to sulphate.  \n\nThe tubes were closed with a plastic cap and the samples were stored. In the \n\nlaboratory, the samples were centrifuged and half of the supernatant was taken for further \n\nanalysis. The samples were then diluted in distilled water (1:100 dilution). This dilution is \n\nnecessary to prevent the interference of chloride ions with sulphate.  Then, 100 \u00b5l of the \n\ndiluted and filtered sample was injected and measured by nonsuppressed ion \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIVV  \n\n66 \n\nFigure IV-3   Cold distillation apparatus.  \n(from Kallmeyer,  et al.; 2004). \n\nchromatography (Waters WISP 712 HPLC Pump; Waters IC-Pak 50 x 4.6 mm anion \n\nexchange column; Waters 730 Autosampler; Sevogor Plotter). An isophtalic acid solution \n\nwas used as eluant. \n\n \n\nIV.3.3 \u2013 Sulphate reduction rates \n\nSulphate reduction, a key process in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter \n\nin marine sediments, is performed by sulphate reducing bacteria, which reduce sulphate \n\nto sulphide (Kallmeyer, et al.; 2004). This process can be generally described by the \n\nfollowing equation. \n\n2 CH2O + SO42- ? 2 HCO 3- + H2S      (IV-3) \n\nThe SR rates were measured based on the reduction of sulphate to sulphide, \n\nconsidering that part of this sulphate may have been partially oxidized.  \n\nThe use of radioactive compounds is \n\nan important tool for the determination of \n\nrates, pathways and intermediate \n\ncompounds in the sulphur cycle. Sulphate \n\nreduction rates (SRR) were determined with \n\nincubation experiments, using 35SO42- as a \n\nradiotracer. \n\nAt each depth, three replicates of \n\nsamples collected by multicoring as well as \n\none abiological control sample (\u201cblind \n\nvalue\u201d) were taken for SR rate \n\nmeasurement. The method used for SR rate \n\nmeasurement is the method described by \n\n(Kallmeyer et al., 2004), which is \n\nsummarized below. \n\nOn board, sediments recovered with \n\n1 cm depth intervals were separately \n\ninjected with trace amounts of 35SO42- and incubated for a short period of time (24-48h), at \n\nin situ temperature. The bacterial sulphate reduction was stopped by adding a 20% zinc \n\nacetate (ZnAc) solution to the sediment sample. Subsequently, zinc precipitates to form \n\n\n\nMMeetthhooddoollooggyy  aanndd  LLaabboorraattoorryy  PPrroocceedduurreess  \n\n67 \n\nsolid reduced compounds. This way, the total reduced 35S is preserved as solid \n\ncompounds such as Zn35S and Fe35S. \n\nThe 35SO42- was separated from the radioactive products by centrifuging the tubes \n\n(4500 rpm, 5 min) containing the sample and then two 100 \u00b5l samples of the supernatant \n\nwere carefully removed. One was kept for further analysis and the other one was stored to \n\nin case there is the need of repeating the analysis. \n\nIn order to obtain the total reduced inorganic sulphur (TRIS), a cold single step \n\ndistillation was performed using the distillation apparatus proposed by Kallmeyer, et al. \n\n2004 (figure IV-3). Figure IV-4 shows the device used in this work. \n\nInitially, the sediment was ressuspended in 20 ml N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF). \n\nThis compound, which is an organic solvent frequently used to promote the reaction, \n\nimproves the recovery of elemental sulphur (ES). ES is not a significant fraction of the \n\ntotal TRIS but may contain a significant fraction of the radioactively labelled sulphide \n\n(Kallmeyer et al., 2004).  \n\n \n\nFigure IV-4  Cold distillation device used in this work for the measurement of SR rates.  \n\n \n\nThe sediment sample was then transferred into a three-neck round-bottom glass \n\nflask with a magnetic stir bar. The flask was then flushed for ten minutes and 8 ml HCl (6 \n\nM) plus 16 ml CrII-solution (1M) were added trough the chemical port, in order to release \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIVV  \n\n68 \n\nall reduced inorganic sulphur species. The TRIS were then trapped into a 7 ml ZnAc  (5 \n\n%) trap, using a flux of nitrogen. \n\nThe 35SO42- radioactivity of the supernatant was determined by transferring the \n\nentire volume of the ZnAc trap into a counting vial, adding 1 ml of H2O and 2 ml of a \n\nscintillation cocktail (Lumasafe Plus). The radioactivity of the remaining SO42- and of Zn35S \n\nwas determined using a liquid scintillation counter. The scintillation counter has an \n\ninherent background which takes part in the total number of counts (Kallmeyer, J. et al.; \n\n2004). This sample background is composed by three different components (Kallmeyer, J. \n\net al.; 2004). \n\nBS = BC + BD +  BT        (IV-4) \n\nWhere: \n\nBS = sample background \n\nBC = counter blank \n\nBD = distillation blank \n\nBT = tracer blank \n\n \n\nKallmeyer et al. (2004) proved that, in the cold distillation method, the counter \n\nblank and the distillation blank together are approximately equivalent to the counter blank. \n\nTherefore, only the latter one is taken in consideration. As regards the tracer blank, for \n\neach station samples denominated \u201cblind values\u201d were used. These are abiological control \n\nsamples, which are samples where no Zn35S is formed, due to the fact that before the \n\ninjection of the tracer the bacterial sulphate reduction was stopped by adding ZnAc (20%). \n\nHence, these \u201cBlind Values\u201d allow the estimation of the amount of non-reduced 35S that \n\nwas transferred from the labelled sediment to the trap during the distillation. \n\nDuring this process the samples were weighted three times (1st: tube plus \n\nsediment plus ZnAc; 2nd: tube plus sediment; 3rd: empty tube). This way, it was possible to \n\ncalculate the amount of sediment used in the distillation. Afterwards, based on the \n\nradioactivity of the 35SO42- and of the reduced H235S it was also possible to calculate the \n\nsulphate reduction rates (SRR) using the equation proposed by (Kallmeyer et al.; 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMMeetthhooddoollooggyy  aanndd  LLaabboorraattoorryy  PPrroocceedduurreess  \n\n69 \n\nSRR = [SO4] x Psed x \naTot\naTris\n\n x \nt\n1\n\n x 1,06 x 1000   (IV-5) \n\nWhere:  \n\nSRR = sulphate reduction rate (nmol cm-3 d-1); \n\n[SO4] = sulphate concentration in the pore water of the sediment sample  \n\n(mmol l-1); \n\nPsed = sediment porosity (mlpore H2O cm \n-3 sed); \n\naTris  = radioactivity of TRIS \u2013 total reduced inorganic sulphur (cpm or dpm); \n\naTot  = total radioactivity used (radioactivity of TRIS + radioactivity of SO42-)  \n(cpm or dpm); \n\nt  = incubation time; \n1,06 = isotopic fractionation factor \n\n1000 = factor for the alteration of units from nmol l-1 to nmol cm-3. \n\n \n\nIV.3.4 \u2013 Anaerobic oxidation of methane rates \n\nAOM is a process through which methane is oxidized using sulphate as the \n\nterminal electron acceptor and can be directly measured using radiotracer experiments, \n\nwith 14CH4 as a tracer. This way, it is possible to quantify the conversion of 14CH4 to 14CO2, \n\nand to calculate the process rate. The method used in this work is similar to the one \n\nproposed by Iversen &amp; Jorgensen (1985). \n\nThe samples were incubated anaerobically between 24 and 48 hours with 50 \u00b5l of \n14CH4 tracer solution, which was transformed into 14CO2. AOM was then stopped by \n\ntransferring the sample to 50 ml glass vials containing 25 ml of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) \n\nand immediately closing the vial with a rubber stop. This allowed the separation of the \n\nCO2 that remained dissolved in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from the CH4 which remained \n\nin the headspace. The method used comprises three steps: \n\n \n\na) Measurement of the total methane of the sample \n\nTotal CH4 of the sample was measured by ion gas chromatography. For this \n\nprocedure, 200 \u00b5l of the headspace were taken and injected into the gas chromatograph. \n\nThis volume is neglectable in face of the total volume of the headspace and therefore will \n\nnot interfere with further 14CH4 measurements. CH4 concentration was then calculated. \n\n \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIVV  \n\n70 \n\n \n\nb) Combustion of 14C-methane to 14C-carbon dioxide \n\nThe total CH4 in the headspace was burned so that it was possible to measure the \n\ntotal amount of 14CH4 indirectly through the amount of 14CO2 after burning. For this \n\npurpose, the burning device illustrated in figure IV-5 was used. The way this system works \n\nis to connect the sample headspace to a furnace through an artificial air flow, where it is \n\nburned at 850\u00baC. Then the 14CO2 is trapped into two succeeding 20 ml scintillation vials \n\ncontaining 1 ml of phenylethylamine plus 7 ml of ethylenglycolmonomethylether \n\n(methoxyethanol). This chemical mixture is used to trap the 14CO2 in the scintillation vials. \n\nThe scintillation vials containing the previous chemical mixture and the 14CO2 were \n\nremoved from the burning system and 10 ml of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold) was added. \n\nThen, both vials were measured in a scintillation counter, and the amount of 14CO2 was \n\ncalculated through the activity measured in the scintillation counter. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \nFig. IV-5   AOM rate measuring device used in the Max Planck Institute for marine \nmicrobiology \u2013 Bremen. \n\n\n\nMMeetthhooddoollooggyy  aanndd  LLaabboorraattoorryy  PPrroocceedduurreess  \n\n71 \n\nFig. IV-6   Shaking device \nused to trap the remaining \nCO2 in the sediment.  \n\nc) CO2 shaking method \n\nThis method was used to calculate the total \n\namount of 14CO2 trapped in the sediment. Therefore, in \n\nthe first place, sediment samples were weighted inside \n\nthe vials without the lid, and transferred together with 15 \n\nml of sodium hydroxide 2,5% (NaOH 2,5%) into a 250 ml \n\nErlenmeyer flask. Afterwards, the Erlenmeyer flask was \n\nclosed with a special rubber stopper connected to a \n\nscintillation vial (figure IV-6) containing 1 ml \n\nphenylethylamine and 1 ml of sodium hydroxide 0,5 M \n\n(NaOH 0,5 M).  \n\nAt last, using a syringe with a long needle, 6 ml of \n\nhydrochloric acid (HCl) was added to the sample through \n\nthe rubber stopper and the Erlenmeyer flask was tightly \n\nclosed with a metal holder. The hydrochloric acid (HCl) \n\nwas used in order to degas the CO2 and the \n\nphenylethylamine was used to trap it in the scintillation \n\nvial. \n\nAOM rates were calculated by the ratio between the amount of CH4, which was \n\ndetermined by gas chromatography, the amount of 14CH4 determined by combustion and \n\nthe amount of 14CO2 determined by the shaking method. The following equation (Treude, \n\n2003) was used in order to calculate AOM rates.  \n\ntvCO\nCOCH\n\nAOM\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\n+\n=\n\n2\n14\n\n2\n12\n\n4\n12\n\n       (IV-6) \n\n \n\nIV.3.5 \u2013 Biomarker analysis \n\nApproximately 80 ml of sediment samples were collected from the Captain \n\nArutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes using gravity and multicores and carbonate \n\ncrusts were recovered from Hesperides and Faro mud volcanoes using a TV-guided grab \n\nsampler. Both sediment and carbonate crust samples were stored at -20 \u00baC. \n\nThe method used for biomarker analyses encompasses three main steps: (1) \n\nsediment extraction; (2) fatty acids saponification; (3) separation of neutral fraction into \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  IIVV  \n\n72 \n\nhydrocarbons, ketones and alcohols. These steps are resumed in the laboratory protocol \n\npresented in Appendix III. The figure IV-7 shows the device used for the lipid extraction. \n\n \n\nA.    B.  \n\nFigure IV-7   Lipid biomarker analysis device used in this work (Max Planck Institute, \nBremen). \n\n \n\nThe extraction procedure and preparation of fatty acid methyl esters (1) was \n\ncarried out according to Elvert and co-workers (2003). The total lipid extract (TLE) was \n\nobtained from approximately 25 g of wet sediment. The TLE was extracted by subsequent \n\nultrasonication using organic solvents of decreasing polarity (2). Internal standards of \n\nknown concentration and carbon isotopic compositions were added prior to extraction. \n\nEsterified fatty acids (FA\u2019s) present in glyco and phospholipids were cleaved by \n\nsaponification with a KOH-solution. After the extraction of the neutral lipid fraction from \n\nthis mixture, FA\u2019s were methylated for analysis with BF3 in methanol yielding fatty acid \n\nmethyl esters (FAMES).  \n\nNeutral lipids were further separated into hydrocarbons, ketones and alcohols (3) \n\nusing a silica glass cartridge (0.5 g packing) (SPE). Prior to separation, the column was \n\nrinsed three times with 5 ml n-hexane/dichloromethane (95:5, v/v). After application of the \n\nneutral fraction, solvent mixtures of increasing polarity were subsequently added: \n\n(I) 5 ml n-hexane/dichloromethane (95:5, v/v); \n\n(II) 5 ml n-hexane/dichloromethane (2:1, v/v); \n\n(III) 5 ml dichloromethane/acetone (9:1, v/v). \n\nNeutral lipid fractions (hydrocarbons (I), ketones (II) and alcohols (III)) were \n\ncollected in 25 ml tipped flasks and the excess solvent was evaporated down to 100 \u00b5l \n\n\n\nMMeetthhooddoollooggyy  aanndd  LLaabboorraattoorryy  PPrroocceedduurreess  \n\n73 \n\nusing rotary evaporation. Finally, neutral lipid fractions were stored at -20 \u00b0C for further \n\nprocessing and/or analysis.  \n\nThe identification of microbes involved in AOM was determined with comparative \n\nlipid biomarker fingerprints. This was based on the fact that ANME-2 is characterized by \n\nhigh amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol to archaeol and the presence of crocetane. ANME-\n\n1, in contrast, contains archaeol but minor amounts of sn2- hydroxyarchaeol and no \n\ncrocetane. Nevertheless, it should be noted that isoprenoid hydrocarbons could not be \n\nmeasured in the sediment samples used in the present work. Desulfosarcina (DSS) \n\nassociated to ANME-2 show a balanced ratio i-C15:0/ai-C15:0, a high abundance of \n\nC16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6. In contrast, DSS associated to ANME-1 are characterised by high \n\namounts of ai-C15:0 to i-C15:0 and contains only little C16:1?5 and no cyC17:0?5,6. \n\n \n\nIV.3.6 \u2013 Stable carbon isotope analysis \n\nThe concentration, identity and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual \n\ncompounds were determined by GC (Gas Chromatography), GC-MS (Gas \n\nChromatography \u2013 Mass Spectrometry) and GC-IRMS (Gas chromatography \u2013 Infrared \n\nMass spectrometry) analysis, respectively. Instrument specifications and operation modes \n\nof the GC, GC-MS and GC-IRMS units were set according to Elvert et al. (2003). \n\nConcentrations were calculated against internal standards. The acquired mass spectra \n\nwere compared with known standards and published data. Stable isotope ratios are given \n\nin the ?-notion against Pee Dee Belemnite ?13C-values of fatty acids.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  VV  \n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\nTo better understand and correlate the multicore and gravity core samples \n\nrecovered from the Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes, both were depth \n\naligned. This is needed because of the fact that multicoring allows collecting sediments \n\nonly until a maximum depth of only 50 cm bsf, whereas gravity coring allows retrieving \n\nsediments from a few meters deep, with the disadvantage of loosing an unknown quantity \n\nof sediment on the top centimetres of the core. Therefore, the exact depth of the samples \n\ncollected from the top of gravity cores had to be tentatively aligned in order to correspond \n\nto the same depths in the multicores. For this propose, the sulphate concentration profile \n\nwas used as reference. It was assumed that sulphate concentration is a function of depth \n\nand that the environment is horizontally homogeneous. As such, the gravity core sulphate \n\nprofile was aligned with the multicore sulphate profile and the amplitude of the depth \n\ninterval of sediment that was lost during the gravity core retrieving could be checked. \n\nAs a result, the gravity core depth was shifted 40 cm downwards in the case of the \n\nCaptain Arutyunov mud volcano and 12,5 cm downwards in the case of the Bonjardim \n\nmud volcano.  \n\nBelow, the results obtained are presented separately for each studied mud \n\nvolcano. In the next chapter (Chapter VI \u2013 Discussion), these results will be discussed, \n\ncorrelated and compared with other similar systems. \n\n \n\nV.1 \u2013 Methane and C2+ hydrocarbons concentrations \n\n \n\nV.1.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano \n\nMethane concentrations in the sediments from this mud volcano, reach a \n\nmaximum of approximately 2 mM at an approximate depth of 38 cm bsf in the multicore \n\nprofile. Above this depth there is a sharp decrease of methane, which is totally consumed \n\nat a depth of 25 cm bsf. Above this depth, methane concentration is nearly zero until the \n\nsediment surface. Methane concentrations measured in the gravity core samples are quite \n\nChapter V \u2013 Results \n\n\n\nRReessuullttss  \n\n75 \n\nsimilar to the ones measured in the multicore samples, reaching a maximum close to 2 \n\nmM (figures V-1A and V-6A). \n\nSimilar to the methane profile, the profile for the C2+ hydrocarbons shows that the \n\nconcentration of these compounds also decreases between 40 cm bsf and the seafloor \n\n(figure V-2 e V-6B). The gas composition of the hydrocarbons from this mud volcano is: \n\n>99% methane,&lt;0,4% ethane,&lt;0,07% propane with trace amounts of butane, which is in \n\nagreement with thermogenic origin. \n\n \n\nV.1.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano \n\nMethane concentrations here have a maximum value of approximately 2,5 mM at a \n\ndepth of approximately 100 cm bsf. From this depth towards surface, a decrease in \n\nmethane concentration is observed, which reaches a value close to zero at 45 cm bsf. \n\nThe sharpest decrease is observed at the depth interval between 45 and 70 cm bsf, which \n\nseems to be the SMTZ. Above 45 cm bsf towards the surface, almost no methane \n\nconcentration is detectable. The methane profile in Bonjardim mud volcano is shown in \n\nfigures V-1B and V-7A. \n\nC2+ hydrobarbons concentration was also measured and, similarly to methane, C2+ \n\ncompounds also decrease greatly between 45 and 70 cm bsf (figure V-2). Here, the \n\nhydrocarbon composition is > 81% methane, &lt;14% ethane, &lt;4,5% propane, and&lt;0,4% \n\nof butane; which also indicates a clear thermogenic origin. \n\n \n\nV.1.3 \u2013 Ginsburg mud volcano \n\nThe maximum methane concentration here was registered at 42 cm bsf, with a \n\nvalue of approximately 1,5 mM. Between this depth and 6 cm bsf, methane concentration \n\ndecreases sharply. No methane was detected above 6 cm bsf (figure V-1C). In the \n\nGinsburg mud volcano only gravity cores were collected and therefore it is important to \n\nremember that the depths referred here are probably not exactly.  \n\n \n\nV.1.4 \u2013 No Name mud volcano \n\nHere, the highest methane concentration value was detected at the lowest part of \n\nthe core, at 417 cm bsf (figure V-1D). From this depth towards surface there is a gradual \n\ndecrease of methane concentration. It is important to highlight a 60 cm interval, between \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  VV  \n\n76 \n\n317 cm bsf and 285 cm bsf where methane is almost totally consumed, reaching a \n\nconcentration value very close to zero at the depth of 235 cm. Above 235 cm, methane \n\nwas undetectable. This indicates that the No Name mud volcano has the deepest SMTZ \n\nof the mud volcanoes analysed so far, localized between 317 and 235 cm bsf. \n\n \n\nV.1.5 \u2013 Gemini mud volcano \n\nIn this mud volcano it was possible to identify a depth interval, between 50-230 cm \n\nbsf, where methane concentrations decrease from 1,7 mM at 230 cm bsf to almost zero at \n\n50cm bsf (figure V-1E). However, the methane concentrations\u2019 decrease along this \n\ninterval is not homogeneous. Between 140 and 120 cm bsf, methane concentration stays \n\nconstant (0,6 mM), which indicates that, in this 20 cm depth interval, methane is not being \n\nconsumed. Based on the methane profile, it is possible to anticipate that the SMTZ must \n\nbe situated between 50 and 230 cm bsf. \n\n \n\nV.2 \u2013 Sulphate concentrations \n\n \n\nV.2.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano \n\nIn this mud volcano, near to the ocean floor, concentrations are close to the typical \n\nsea floor concentration (approximately 28 mM) and remain like this from the sea floor until \n\n25 cm bsf. Between this depth and 40 cm bsf, there is as a distinct layer with a strong \n\ndecrease in sulphate concentrations. The sulphate is completely consumed at around 75 \n\ncm bsf (figures IV-1A and IV-6A). \n\nIt is possible to distinguish a depth horizon in the sediment where both methane \n\nand sulphate are strongly consumed, which is the sulphate-methane transition zone \n\n(SMTZ). In the sediments from the Captain Arutyunov mud volcano, this depth is between \n\n25 and 40 cm bsf. See highlighted horizon in figure V-6A. \n\n \n\nV.2.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano \n\nRegarding sulphate, as expected, near the surface, the sulphate concentration is \n\nclose to the sea water sulphate concentration (28 mM) and stays constant with depth until \n\n20 cm bsf. At this depth, the sulphate concentration starts decreasing until 70 cm bsf \n\nwhere its concentration is nearly zero. In this case, the depth interval where the sharpest \n\n\n\nRReessuullttss  \n\n77 \n\ndecrease is observed is between 30 and 55 cm bsf, which is not exactly coincident with \n\nthe depth interval of maximum decrease of methane, although it is reasonably close \n\n(figure V-1B). \n\n \n\nV.2.3 \u2013 Ginsburg mud volcano \n\nHere, close to the sea floor, as expected, the sulphate concentration is close to 28 \n\nmM. From the ocean floor to 50 cm bsf, the sulphate concentration decreases intensively. \n\nBelow 50 cm there is a gradual increase in the sulphate concentration (figure V-1C). \n\nConsidering this information, it can be concluded that the SMTZ, in the sediments from \n\nthis mud volcano, is located between the surface and approximately 50 cm bsf, although \n\nthis horizon is most likely situated a few centimetres below, considering that we only have \n\ngravity core data available for this mud volcano. \n\n \n\nV.2.4 \u2013 No Name mud volcano \n\nThe sulphate concentration here has a maximum value close to the sea floor \n\n(approximately 28 mM), and shows a constant decrease until 270 cm bsf (figure V-1D). \n\nTaking into account this information and also the methane concentration profile, it is \n\npossible to distinguish the SMTZ between 200 and 320 cm bsf.

Between this depth and 40 cm bsf there is an abrupt decrease in AOM rates, \n\nwhich are nearly zero at the lowest limit of the SMTZ (figure V-3A and V-6C). \n\nAs regards SR rate profile, it is quite similar to the AOM rate profile, indicating a \n\nsharp increase in SR rates between 25 and 40 cm bsf (figure V-3A and V-6C). The depth \n\nhorizon where this increase is observed corresponds to the SMTZ. Below 40 cm bsf, \n\nsulphate is completely consumed, and therefore the SR rate is nearly zero. The highest \n\nrates are registered at an approximate depth of 38 bsf with a value close to 25 nmol cm-3 \n\nd-1 (figures V-3A and V-6C).  \n\n \n\nV.3.2 \u2013 Bonjardim mud volcano \n\nThe sulphate reduction rates\u2019 profile for this mud volcano is in agreement with the \n\nmethane and sulphate profiles. In this case, SR rates show more than one peak. The first \n\npeak has a value close to 8 nmol cm-3 d-1 (38 cm bsf) and the second SR rate peak \n\nreaches a value of 15 nmol cm-3 d-1 at approximately 55 cm bsf. The latter is coincident \n\nwith the SMTZ found in the methane and sulphate profiles described previously. Below 55 \n\ncm the SR rates decrease constantly with depth and reach a value close to zero at 100 \n\ncm bsf where, based on the sulphate concentration profile, there is no evidence of \n\nsulphate penetration in the sediment anymore (figures V-3B and V-7C).  \n\nAOM rates also peak at the SMTZ, although the values are too high when \n\ncompared with SR rates. The maximum AOM rate in Bonjardim was detected at \n\napproximately 58 cm bsf, with a value of 2,6 nmol cm-3 d-1. Above and below this depth, \n\nAOM rates rapidly decrease (figures V-3B and V-7C). \n\n \n\nV.3.3 \u2013 Ginsburg mud volcano \n\nSulphate reduction rates along the core retrieved from the Ginsburg mud volcano \n\nhave values very close to the detection limit. Near to the surface the value is close 0,2 \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  VV  \n\n80 \n\nnmol cm-3 d-1 (figure V-3C). This value decreases until 65 cm bsf and, at 75 cm bsf, there \n\nis a slight peak with a magnitude of 0,3 nmol cm-3 d-1. \n\nThe highest value for AOM rates registered in the sediments from the Ginsburg \n\nmud volcano were approximately 2,2 nmol cm-3 d-1 at 75 cm bsf (figure V-3C). Below this \n\ndepth rates decrease rapidly until the bottom of the gravity core. \n\nIt is therefore evident that there is a decoupling of SR and AOM in this core, which \n\nis revealed by the difference in the depth where SR and AOM were detected and by the \n\ndifference of magnitude of the rates. \n\n \n\nV.3.4 \u2013 No Name mud volcano \n\nAt the No Name mud volcano, the highest SR rates were measured at 195 cm bsf \n\nwith a value of approximately 1,8 nmol cm-3 d-1 (figure V-3D), forming a distinct peak. \n\nAbove this depth SR rates decrease intensively; the same happens below. \n\nOn the other hand, AOM measurements only revealed a slight increase in the \n\nrates at the bottom of the gravity core, at a depth of approximately 285 cm (figure V-3D). \n\nThe maximum rate registered at this depth is 0,13 nmol cm-3 d-1. Similar to Ginsburg mud \n\nvolcano, there is also here evidence of a mismatch of AOM and SR rates, both in the \n\ndepth horizon, and in the order of magnitude. \n\n \n\nV.3.5 \u2013 Gemini mud volcano \n\nIn the sediment core from the Gemini mud volcano, two main SR rate peaks are \n\nobserved at the SMTZ previously identified (V-3E). The first peak is detected at 50 cm bsf \n\nwith a magnitude of 4,7 nmol cm-3 d-1. The second peak and also the highest rates \n\ndetected have a value of 6,5 nmol cm-3 d-1 and are registered at 92,5 cm bsf. There is no \n\nevidence of sulphate reduction below the 150 cm bsf, and therefore there is no sulphate \n\npenetration below this depth (V-3E). \n\nIn the lower half of the core, between 70 and 235 cm bsf, there is a clear peak of \n\nAOM rates (figure V-3E). This peak is situated at 125 cm bsf and has a value of 2,6 nmol \n\ncm-3 d-1. Above this depth, AOM rates decrease slightly until 92,5 cm and then continues \n\nto decrease intensively to the surface. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRReessuullttss  \n\n81 \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n(c\n\nm\n b\n\nsf\n)\n\n-450\n\n-400\n\n-350\n\n-300\n\n-250\n\n-200\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\nAOM 9041-1\nSR 9041-1\n\nAOM 9036-2\nSR 9036-2\n\nAOM, SRR (nmol cm-3 d-1)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nAOM 9051-1\nSR 9051-1\n\nSR 9051-2\nAOM 9051-2\n\n0 2 4 6\n\n-450\n\n-400\n\n-350\n\n-300\n\n-250\n\n-200\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\nAOM 9061-1\nSR 9061-1\n\n0 2 4 6\n\nAOM 9063-1\nSR 9063-1\n\nAOM, SRR (nmol cm-3 d-1)\n\n0 2 4 6\n\nAOM 9067-1\nSR 9067-1  \n\n \n\n Figure V-3  AOM and SR rate profiles; A \u2013 AOM rate profile for the Captain \nArutyunov mud volcano (compilation of multicore and gravity core data); B \u2013 AOM rate profile for \nthe Bonjardim mud volcano (compilation of multicore and gravity core data); C \u2013 AOM rate profile \nfor the Ginsburg mud volcano; D \u2013 AOM rate profile for the No Name mud volcano; D \u2013 AOM rate \nprofile for the Gemini mud volcano; circles correspond to multicore samples and triangles refer to \n\ngravity core samples. \n\n \n\n \n\nV.4 \u2013 Lipid biomarker analysis \n\n \n\nV.4.1 \u2013 Captain Arutyunov mud volcano \n\nSeveral bacterial lipids show concentration peaks at the SMTZ.

Below the SMTZ, the concentration of these \n\nbacterial-related compounds strongly decreases. Also to be noticed is the fact that i-C15:0 \n\nand ai-C15:0 abundances are quite similar. The ratio between these two compounds is 0.7 \n\n(table V-1). This is indicative for DSS associated to ANME2.  \n\nIt was also registered, at the SMTZ, the increase of several archaeal alcohols, \n\nwhich are archaea-related lipid biomarkers. In figure V-6G two of them are represented: \n\narchaeol and sn2-hydroxyarchaeol. Both compounds increase in the SMTZ and sharply \n\ndecrease just below it.

Compared with Captain Arutyunov the increase of these values is lower. In figure \n\nV-5 the profile of the concentration of several fatty acids extracted from the sediments of \n\nBonjardim mud volcano is shown. Although the abundance of these compounds is not as \n\nhigh as in the case of Captain Arutyunov, a discrete peak of several fatty acids is \n\nobserved at 58 cm bsf. This is the case for example of C16:1?5 and ai-C15:0 (figure V-5 and \n\nV-7E). The ratio between ai-C15:0 and i-C15:0 is very low (? 0,12), traducing the great \n\nabundance of ai-C15:0 comparably to i-C15:0 (table V-1). This is indicative for DSS \n\nassociated to ANME1.  \n\nLipid biomarkers for archaea were also detected, for example archaeol and sn2-\n\nhydroxyarchaeol, which show an evident peak 58 cm bsf, precisely at the same depth the \n\nbacterial fatty acids peak and also at the SMTZ (figure V-7G).

In most cases, the SMTZ is quite shallow and in most of the cases, this horizon is \n\nsituated above 100 cm depth. The only exceptions are the No Name mud volcano where \n\nthe SMTZ was found between 200 and 320 cm bsf and the Gemini mud volcano where \n\nthe methane consumption zone is observed between 50-150 bsf. No Name mud volcano \n\nis therefore the one where sulphate penetrates deepest in the sediment reaching \n\napproximately 3 m below sea floor. \n\nIn all the cases the methane and sulphate profiles are sharp and the transition \n\nzones are very well defined. Bellow the SMTZ there is no significant sulphate penetration \n\nin the sediments, giving evidence of coupled methane and sulphate consumption at this \n\ndepth horizon.  \n\nNo significant variations in sulphate concentration profiles are observed in any \n\ncase; sulphate exhibits a pronounced decrease with depth until it is completely consumed \n\nand its concentration becomes zero. \n\nThe phospolipid-derived fatty acids extracted from the sediments from the Captain \n\nArutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes gave, in the first case, evidence for DSS \n\nassociated with ANME1, and in the second case, the values were indicative for \n\nDSS/ANME2. The archaea biomarkers, archaeol and sn2-hydroxyachaeol also gave the \n\nsame evidence. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\nRReessuullttss  \n\n87 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n?\n13\n\nC\nSO\n\n4 \n(m\n\nM\n)\n\nC\nH\n\n4 \n(m\n\nM\n)\n\n0\n1.\n\n0\n2.\n\n0\n3.\n\n0\nAO\n\nM\n,S\n\nR\nR\n\n(n\nm\n\nol\ncm\n\n-3\nd-\n\n1 )\nSu\n\nlp\nhi\n\nde\n(m\n\nM\n)\n\nco\nnc\n\n(\u00b5\ng\n\ng-\ndw\n\n-1\n)\n\nC\n16\n\n:1\nw\n\n5c\nC\n\ny1\n7:\n\n0 \nw\n\n5,\n6\n\nC\nH\n\n4\n\nSO\n4\n\nAO\nM\n\nSR\nR\n\nSu\nlp\n\nhi\nde\n\nC\n16\n\n:1\nw\n\n5c\nC\n\ny1\n7:\n\n0 \nw\n\n5,\n6\n\nsn\n2-\n\nhy\ndr\n\nox\nar\n\nch\nae\n\nol\nar\n\nch\nae\n\nol\n\nco\nnc\n\n(\u00b5\ng\n\ng-\ndw\n\n-1\n)\n\nDepth (cm bsf.)\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n30\n\n-1\n60\n\n-1\n40\n\n-1\n20\n\n-1\n00-8\n0\n\n-6\n0\n\n-4\n0\n\n-2\n00\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n30\n\n0\n0.\n\n2\n0.\n\n4\n0.\n\n6\n0.\n\n8\n0\n\n0.\n1\n\n0.\n2\n\n0.\n3\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n-8\n0\n\n-6\n0\n\n-4\n0\n\n-2\n0\n\nSu\nlp\n\nhi\nde\n\n-g\nra\n\ndi\nen\n\nt\nA\n\n.\nB\n\n.\nC\n\n.\nD\n\n.\nE.\n\nF.\n\n \n F\n\nig\nur\n\ne \nV\n\n-6\n  \n\n G\neo\n\nch\nem\n\nic\nal\n\n g\nra\n\ndi\nen\n\nts\n in\n\n s\ned\n\nim\nen\n\nts\n r\n\nec\nov\n\ner\ned\n\n fr\nom\n\n th\ne \n\nC\nap\n\nta\nin\n\n A\nru\n\nty\nun\n\nov\n m\n\nud\n v\n\nol\nca\n\nno\n.

This is also \n\nconfirmed, in the case of Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes by the \n\nsulphide profiles. Sulphide, which is a product of SR coupled to AOM, also peaks at the \n\nSMTZ. \n\nThe increase of AOM and SR rates at the SMTZ depth indicates that the \n\nascendant methane is consumed anaerobically coupled with sulphate reduction, which is \n\nleading to a total depletion of the two compounds in the sub-surface sediments. This is \n\nmore clearly observed in sediments from Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud \n\nvolcanoes, but it is also observed in the Ginsburg, Gemini and No Name mud volcanoes.  \n\nAttempts to rank seep and AOM activity puts the mud volcanoes studied in this \n\nwork in low to medium range, in comparison with other well studied methane seeps. In the \n\nNamibian Shelf,  in the north western Black Sea Shelf and in the western Argentinean \n\nBasin for example, the SMTZ is located several meters bsf and methane fluxes are low, \n\nwith values usually&lt;55 mmol m-2 yr-1 (Hensen et al., 2003; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2001; \n\nNiew\u00f6hner et al., 1998). These values are comparable to those found in the Ginsburg, \n\nGemini and No Name mud volcanoes, respectively, but they are generally lower than the \n\nmeasured AOM activity at Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes. \n\nThe maximum values of ex situ AOM measured rates are two orders of magnitude \n\nlower in comparison with habitats characterized by high methane turnover rates such as \n\nHydrate Ridge, the Gulf of Mexico and the H\u00e5kon Mosby Mud Volcano, where AOM rates \n\nintegrated over depth below Beggiatoa mats are usually >4000 mmol m-2 yr-1 (Joye et al., \n\n2004; Treude et al., 2003. In sediments of highly active systems, this value can exceed \n\n500 nmol cm-3 d-1 (Joye et al., 2004; Treude et al., 2003). \n\nGenerally, methane and sulphate are consumed at a 1:1 ratio during syntrophic \n\nAOM (Nauhaus et al., 2002; Treude et al., 2003). The observed offset in the measured \n\nChapter VI \u2013 Discussion and conclusions \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  VVII  \n\n90 \n\nrates gives therefore evidence that AOM accounts only for a fraction of SR. This indicates \n\na carbon input besides methane. The presence of C2+ compounds in the sediments of the \n\nCaptain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes, as well as the probable presence of \n\npetroleum in sediments of the Ginsburg mud volcano, shows that a complex mixture of \n\nhigher hydrocarbons besides methane is transported from the deep reservoirs to the \n\nshallow sediments. \n\nThese compounds are then consumed anaerobically, most likely together with \n\nsulphate in sediments at the SMTZ, resulting in SRR that exceed AOM. This line of \n\nevidence is further supported by measured rates showing a lower ratio of AOM relative to \n\nSR accompanied by a higher content of C2+ compounds in the sediments from the \n\nBonjardim mud volcano, compared with the sediments from the Captain Arutyunov mud \n\nvolcano.  \n\nTherefore, it is probable that anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation accounts for a \n\nsubstantial fraction of the measured SRR presented in this study which is comparable to \n\nprevious findings from the Gulf of Mexico where SRR, most likely fuelled by anaerobic \n\noxidation of higher hydrocarbons, may exceed AOM by 20-fold (Joye et al., 2004). \n\nMoreover, sulphide, showing the highest concentration at the SMTZ depth, is apparently \n\nconsumed in both the overlying and the underlying horizons. The upward flux of sulphide \n\nmight be controlled by the motile bacteria Beggiatoa, which are known to oxidize sulphide \n\nwith stored nitrate in reduced sediments. \n\nAbundance studies (fingerprinting) of specific lipids is a common tool to identify \n\norganisms chemotaxonomically (Madigan et al., 2000). This approach has been used \n\nextensively to identify methanotrophic organisms, since a high carbon isotope \n\nfractionation leads to very low ?13C signatures in the lipid biomass. Thus, single lipid \n\ncompounds of methanotrophic organisms can be distinguished from those that are not \n\nmethane derived in a mixture of organisms with different physiological functioning.  \n\nElevated concentrations and associated low ?13C signatures of specific archaeal \n\nand bacterial membrane lipids extracted from sediments from the SMTZ at Captain \n\nArutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes, suggest that AOM is mediated by a microbial \n\ncommunity consisting of a consortia of archaea and SRB. \n\nFurthermore, the presence of these lipids in authigenic carbonates shows that \n\nAOM causes carbonate precipitation both in the Hesperides and the Faro mud volcanoes. \n\nHowever, relative abundances of the archaeal isoprenoid alcohols, archaeol and sn2-\n\nhydroxyarchaeol, and of the bacterial fatty accids i-C15:0, ai-C15:0, C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5.6, \n\n\n\nDDiissccuussssiioonn  aanndd  ccoonncclluussiioonnss  \n\n91 \n\nindicate that differences of environmental parameters of the studied mud volcanoes are \n\nselective for a diversity of methanotrophic communities.  \n\nA low ratio of archaeol to sn2-hydroxyarchaeol in the sediments from the Captain \n\nArutyunov mud volcano is in good agreement with published data for ANME2. These \n\narchaea usually form aggregates with SRB of the DSS cluster which contain high amounts \n\nof the unusual fatty acids, C16:1?5 and cyC17:1?5,6, which are amoung the most abundant \n\nand 13C most depleted fatty acids at Captain Arutyunov mud volcano sediments. \n\nMoreover, equal amounts of iso and ante-iso branched C15:0 fatty acids were reported for \n\nDSS associated with ANME2, whereas ANME1 associated DSS contain high amounts of \n\nai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0. \n\nHowever, the presence of the fatty accid C17:1?6, which is clearly detectable and \n\nstrongly 13C depleted in our samples indicates that bacteria other than DSS are involved \n\nin AOM. This fatty acid has previously been found in a variety of SRB such as \n\nDesulforhabdus, Desulfomicrobium and Desulforhobpalus species (Knoblauch et al., \n\n1999) as well as in  Desulfobulbus. The latter has been reported as a syntrophic partner in \n\nAOM but, in contrast to the present data, without the simultaneous occurrence of \n\ncyC17:0w5,6. A first conclusion would be that AOM at Captain Arutyunov mud volcano is \n\nmediated by predominant amounts of ANME2/DSS and to a lesser extend by \n\nANME2/DSB. \n\nAssuming the present data, a contribution of ANME3/DSB seems also possible as \n\nthe lipid signature of ANME2 and ANME3 is significantly different in the hydrocarbon \n\nfraction; however, this hypothesis cannot be tested because we could not measure this \n\nfraction due to contamination problems. Nevertheless, in comparison to cyC17:0w5,6 and \n\nC16:1?5, the ?13C signature of C17:1?6 is less depleted, which indicates a C17:1?6 producing \n\nSRB on an AOM derived carbon substrate. The ?13C values of archaeal and bacterial \n\nlipids are high, in general, with respectively -30 \u2030 and -45\u2030. These values are in good \n\nagreement with published data from cold seeps with high methane turnover rates directly \n\nindicating that AOM is the predominant biomass generating process at the SMTZ in the \n\nCaptain Arutyunov mud volcano. \n\nOn the other hand, the sediments from the Bonjardim mud volcano SMTZ, are \n\ncharacterized by equally high amounts of ai-C15:0 and C16:1?5 relative to i-C15:0. These \n\nabundance values for fatty acids are both indicative for DSS associated with ANME1 and \n\nANME2. Correspondingly, the ratio of archaeol to sn2-hydroxyarchaeol is in good \n\nagreement with published values for ANME1, ANME2 and ANME3. However, neither \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  VVII  \n\n92 \n\ncyC17:0?5,6 or C17:1?6 were detected, which might be due to the overall low concentrations \n\nof lipids in the sediments from the Bonjardim mud volcano. The low ?13C signatures for \n\nspecific archaeal and bacterial biomarkers indicate that a process, other than AOM, \n\nsignificantly contributes to the lipid biomass. This is in good agreement with co-occurring \n\nhigh amounts of fatty acids presenting ?13C signatures associated to heterotrophic \n\nprocesses. \n\nThe lipid composition in the authigenic carbonates from the Hesperides and the \n\nFaro mud volcanoes is in very good agreement with published values for DSS/ANME1 \n\ncommunities. However, unlike carbonates from the Faro mud volcano, comparably high \n\n?13C values of fatty acids in the carbonates from the Hesperides mud volcano indicate a \n\ncontribution to biomass of processes other than AOM. \n\nApparently, AOM and heterotrophic microbial processes co-occurred while AOM \n\ninduced carbonate precipitation entrapped both types of microbes. Another difference is \n\nthe generally low concentration of lipids from the carbonates from the Hesperides mud \n\nvolcano compared to Faro mud volcano. An explanation for this phenomenon could be \n\nthat the sampled crusts from the Hesperides mud volcano are older and exposed to \n\ndiagenesis for a longer period of time. A rather recent formation of the sampled \n\ncarbonates from the Faro mud volcano is likely, as these were stained black from sulphide \n\nand recovered together with some specimens of the clam Acharax which is, in a methane \n\ndominated environment, indicative for low AOM activities in a sub-surface horizon. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nDDiissccuussssiioonn  aanndd  ccoonncclluussiioonnss  \n\n93 \n\nVI.2 - Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe data discussed in this work gives strong evidence that methane and higher \n\nhydrocarbons, rising through conduits from deep reservoirs, are all consumed within the \n\nsediments, and therefore do not reach the water column, at the present state of activity. \n\nHigh sulphide concentrations show that methane and higher hydrocarbon oxidation \n\nprocesses are mediated under anaerobic conditions. Correspondingly, AOM and SR rates \n\npeak in a distinct and narrow sulphate-methane transition zone at various depths below \n\n25 cm bsf. In comparison with other methane dominated environments of the world\u2019s \n\noceans, AOM activity in the Gulf of Cadiz is low to mid range and is generally exceeded \n\nby SR because a substantial fraction of this process is fuelled by the anaerobic oxidation \n\nof higher hydrocarbons which are expelled from the deep reservoirs of the studied mud \n\nvolcanoes as well. Lipid biomarker analysis gives strong indications that AOM in the mud \n\nvolcano sediments from the Gulf of Cadiz is mediated by various types of the previously \n\ndescribed ANME .  \n\nFurthermore, this process has resulted in the precipitation of vast amounts of \n\ncarbonates in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz. However, only scarce traces of \n\nmethane oxidation processes were found in surface sediments. This, together with the \n\nabsence of observation, during the GAP cruise, of visible fluid or gas escape, indicates \n\nthat methane, in this area, is generally oxidized in comparably deep sediment horizons. In \n\ncontrast, highly active cold vents such those found at Hydrate Ridge, the Gulf of Mexico or \n\nH\u00e5kon Mosby mud volcano, which discharge methane into the oxic marine hydrosphere, \n\nare characterized by high methane and sulphate turnover rates in surface sediments \n\n(Boetius et al., 2000; Joye et al., 2004; Treude et al., 2003; Niemann et al unpubl.). To be \n\nnoticed is the fact that evidence of located gas seepage was detected over the Mercator \n\nmud volcano in the recent TTR-15 cruise (Pinheiro, pers. comm.). \n\nOnly a few small patches covered with Beggiatoa mats were found during the GAP \n\ncruise in the Faro mud volcano, indicating that the presence of comparably high methane \n\ncontents in surface sediments is a localized phenomenon. Also only a few Solemyid clams \n\nwere recovered from the Faro mud volcano and previously from the Ginsburg mud \n\nvolcano (Gardner, 2001). Although, Pogonophora were found previously and recovered \n\nfrom Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcano (Pinheiro et al., 2003), in the results \n\nof the present study, namely rate the rates of the biogeochemical processes, did not \n\nindicate a high activity at the present state.  Nevertheless, in some mud volcanoes, mud \n\n\n\nCChhaapptteerr  VVII  \n\n94 \n\nbreccia was found without the recovery of a layer of hemipelagic sediments, suggesting \n\nrecent activity. \n\nTherefore, the five mud volcanoes studied on the scope of this thesis do not \n\napparently contribute significantly to atmospheric methane at their present state of activity. \n\nHowever, there is evidence for extensive fluid and/or gas escape in the past, as indicated \n\nby the widespread  occurrence of massive carbonate chimneys and crusts along or in \n\nclose proximity to the main channels of the Mediterranean outflow water in the northern \n\npart of the Gulf of Cadiz (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003). There is also \n\ngood evidence of multiphase activity of mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz, as shown by \n\ntypical \u201cChristmas tree\u201d structures observed on high-resolution seismic profiles (Somoza \n\net al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2002). It is therefore possible that the activity of mud \n\nvolcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz is in a transient state of low activity at present. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAAppppeennddiicceess  \n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix I \u2013 Determination of Porosity \n\n \n\n1 \u2013 record the weight of 10 ml cylinder; \n\n2 \u2013 tare the balance; \n\n3 \u2013 add sediment into cylinder and record (net) wet weight;  \n\n4 \u2013 tare balance; \n\n5 \u2013 fill up cylinder to 10 ml mark with de-ionized water and record weight \n\nof the added water; \n\n6 \u2013 dry the sediment in the oven at a temperature &lt;90 \u00b0C (ca. 2 days); \n\n7 \u2013 record (gross) weight of dry sediment (incl. cylinder); \n\n8 \u2013 annotate all the measurements and data. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendices \n\n\n\nAAppppeennddiicceess  \n\n96 \n\nAppendix II \u2013 Combustion of 14C-methane to 14C-carbon dioxide1 \n\n \n\n \n\na) Preparation of the system: \n\n? close all faucets and the flow regulator; \n\n? heat furnace to 850\u00b0C; \n\n? change needles of the scintillation vials in the hood against new ones (old \n\nneedles could be obstructed). \n\n \n\nIMPORTANT: The in-flow needle has to be longer and thinner than the out-\nflow needle.

During the R/V SONNE expedition \u201cGAP- Gibraltar Arc Processes (SO175)\u201d in 5 \n\nDecember 2003, several mud volcanoes were explored for gas seepage and associated \n\nmicrobial methane turnover. Pore water analyses and methane oxidation measurements in \n\nsediment cores recovered from the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyunov, \n\nBonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and a newly discovered mud volcano like structure called \u201cNo \n\nName\u201d show that thermogenic methane and associated higher hydrocarbons rising from 10 \n\ndeeper sediment strata are completely consumed within the seabed. The presence of a distinct \n\nmethane-sulphate transition zone (SMT) overlapping with high sulphide concentrations reveal \n\nthat methane oxidation is mediated under anaerobic conditions with sulphate as the electron \n\nacceptor. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulphate reduction (SR) rates  show \n\nmaxima in distinct subsurface sediment horizons at the SMT. The position of the SMT varied 15 \n\nbetween mud volcanoes at depths from 20 to 200 cm below sea floor. In comparison to other \n\nfluid flow impacted environments of the world oceans, AOM activity (<383 mmol m-2 yr-1) \n\nand diffusive methane fluxes (<321 mmol m-2 yr-1) in mud volcano sediments of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz are low to mid range. AOM was generally exceeded by SR, most likely because other \n\nhydrocarbons were oxidized anaerobically by sulphate reducing microbes. Corresponding 20 \n\nlipid biomarker and 16S rDNA clone library analysis give evidence that AOM is mediated by \n\na mixed community of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and associated sulphate reducing \n\nbacteria (SRB) in the studied mud volcanoes. Little is known about the variability of methane \n\nfluxes in this environment but the 13C-depleted lipid imprint in carbonate crusts that litter the \n\nsea floor of mud volcanoes in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz shows that extensive, 25 \n\nmethane-related carbonate precipitation once took place. However, actual sea floor video \n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\nobservations showed only scarce traces of methane emission and associated biological \n\nprocesses at the seafloor. No active fluid or free gas escape was observed visually. In \n\ncombination wit the observed depletion of methane in subsurface sediments, this indicates \n\nthat the contribution of methane to the hydrosphere and potentially to the atmosphere is \n\ninsignificant at present. 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n 25 \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n \n \n \nMethane is an aggressive greenhouse gas with a global warming potential that is 21 to 56-fold 5 \n\nhigher compared to CO2 (Manne and Richels, 2001; Wuebbles and Hayhoe, 2002).  In recent \n\nyears, increasing research effort has therefore been dedicated to elucidate sources and sinks of \n\nmethane. Anthropogenic sources as well as natural emission from wetlands contribute to the \n\nglobal flux of methane to the atmosphere by 74% (396 Tg yr-1) (Judd et al., 2002). Recently, \n\nmud volcanism has been identified as an important escape pathway of methane and higher 10 \n\nhydrocarbons (Dimitrov, 2002; Dimitrov, 2003; Judd et al., 2002). Mud volcanism is caused \n\nby various geological processes at continental margins such as tectonic accretion and faulting, \n\nrapid burial of sediments and fluid emissions from mineral dehydration. These processes can \n\nlead to an abnormally high pore fluid pressure and the extrusion of mud and fluids to the \n\nsurface which is often accompanied by the expulsion of methane and higher hydrocarbons 15 \n\n(Charlou et al., 2003; Kopf, 2002; Milkov, 2000; Somoza et al., 2003). Mud volcanoes (MVs) \n\nare structurally diverse ranging in shape from amorphous mud pies to conical structures and \n\nin size from a few meters to kilometres in diameter and height, respectively (Dimitrov, 2002). \n\nGlobal estimates suggest that terrestrial and shallow water mud volcanoes contribute between \n\n2.2 and 6 Tg yr-1 of methane to the atmosphere and that 27 Tg yr-1 of methane may escape 20 \n\nfrom deep water mud volcanoes (Dimitrov, 2003; Milkov et al., 2003). While there is a \n\nreliable number of ~900 known terrestrial mud volcanoes, estimates for marine mud \n\nvolcanoes range between 800 and 100000, which makes any budget calculations very \n\npreliminary (Dimitrov, 2002; Dimitrov, 2003; Milkov, 2000; Milkov et al., 2003). Previous \n\nestimates suggested that the contribution of the worlds oceans to atmospheric methane is 25 \n\nsmall with 2-3% at present (Houghton et al., 1996; Judd et al., 2002; Kvenvolden, 2002; \n\nReeburgh, 1996). However, such estimates do not account for locally focused gas seepage \n\nfrom structures like mud volcanoes and other types of cold seeps.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\nThe main sink for methane in the ocean is the anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulphate \n\nas electron acceptor (Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Iversen and J\u00f8rgensen, 1985; Nauhaus et \n\nal., 2002; Treude et al., 2003). This process is mediated by archaea, operating most likely in \n\ncooperation with sulphate reducing bacteria. So far, two groups of anaerobic methanotrophic \n\narchaea (ANME-1, ANME-2) have been identified (Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 1999; 5 \n\nHinrichs et al., 1999; Michaelis et al., 2002; Orphan et al., 2001b; Pancost et al., 2000; Thiel \n\net al., 1999). They usually occur together with SRB from a distinct, yet uncultivated cluster \n\nwithin the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group (Seep-SRB1) (Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et \n\nal., 1999; Hinrichs et al., 1999; Knittel et al., 2003; Knittel et al., 2005; Michaelis et al., 2002; \n\nOrphan et al., 2001; Pancost et al., 2000; Thiel et al., 1999). Generally, microbial methane 10 \n\noxidation is characterized by a strong discrimination against the heavy, stable carbon isotope \n\n13C, leading to a significant depletion in the 13C-content of metabolites and biomass (Elvert et \n\nal., 1999; Orphan et al., 2001b; Summons et al., 1994; Thiel et al., 1999; Whiticar, 1999; \n\nWhiticar et al., 1986). Such conspicuous isotope signatures of specific lipid biomarker for the \n\narchaeal and bacterial partners in AOM mediating communities has been a main tool in 15 \n\nstudying the diversity and functioning of cold seep ecosystems (Blumenberg et al., 2004; \n\nElvert et al., 2003; Elvert et al., 2001; Hinrichs et al., 1999; Michaelis et al., 2002; Orphan et \n\nal., 2001b). \n\nDuring the UNESCO program \u201cTraining through Research (TTR)\u201d, numerous mud volcanoes \n\nhosting methane-hydrate were discovered in the Gulf of Cadiz (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 20 \n\n2001; Kenyon et al., 2000; Mazurenko et al., 2002; Somoza et al., 2002). However, the \n\noccurrence of methane emission to the hydrosphere and the geochemical and microbiological \n\nactivity of these potential seep structures remained unknown. During the SO-175 expedition \n\n\u201cGAP\u201d, we studied several mud volcanoes with the aid of sea-floor video imaging as well as \n\nvideo-guided sampling of sediments and carbonate crusts. The main focus of this 25 \n\ninvestigation was to find the hot spots of methane turnover, to estimate the magnitude of \n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\nmethane consumption in the sediments of several mud volcanoes using ex situ rate \n\nmeasurements and diffusive flux calculations, as well as to identify the key methanotrophs \n\nusing lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA methods. \n\n \n\n 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 25 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 7\n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n \n2.1. Geological Setting  \n\n 5 \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located west of the Gibraltar Arc, between Iberia and the African plate \n\n(Fig. 1). This area has experienced a complex tectonic history with several episodes of \n\nextension, strike-slip and compression related to the closure of the Tethys Ocean, the opening \n\nof the N-Atlantic, and the African-Eurasian convergence since the Cenozoic (Maldonado et \n\nal., 1999). During the Tortonian, a large olistrostome body made of eroded material from the 10 \n\nBetic Cordillera (Spain) and Rif Massif (Morocco) was emplaced west of the Straits of \n\nGibraltar (Maldonado and Comas, 1992; Somoza et al., 2003). Due to the ongoing \n\ncompression, these rapidly deposited sediments dewater intensely and form MVs and fluid \n\nescape structures (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003). The Gulf of Cadiz has been intensely surveyed \n\nwith geophysical tools, leading to the discovery of the first MVs, mud diapirs and pockmarks 15 \n\nin 1999 (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2000; Pinheiro et al., 2003). In addition, an extensive \n\nfield of mud volcanoes and diapiric structures covered with carbonate chimneys and crusts \n\nwas discovered along or in close proximity of the main channels of the Mediterranean outflow \n\nwater (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003; Kenyon et al., 2001; Kenyon et al., 2000; Kopf et al., 2004; \n\nSomoza et al., 2003).  20 \n\nIn the present study, Captain Arutyunov (Capt. Arutyunov), Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini, \n\nHesperides and Faro MV and a newly discovered structure termed \u201cNo Name\u201d, were \n\ninvestigated (Fig. 1, Tab. 1). Prior to biogeochemical sampling, the sea floor of selected MVs \n\nwas monitored with the video-sled OFOS or with a video-guided multiple-corer (MUC, Tab. \n\n1).  25 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 8\n\n2.2. Sample Collection and Storage  \n\n \n\n Sediments of several mud volcanoes were sampled by gravity coring in the central crater \n\nregion (Tab. 1, Fig. 2). Additionally, surface sediments of Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim \n\nMV were obtained with a video-guided MUC because the top decimetres of sediment cover 5 \n\nare usually lost during gravity core retrieval. Video-guided MUC sampling enabled the \n\nretrieval of undisturbed surface sediments of up to 50 cm sediment depth. Gravity coring \n\nretrieved up to 5 m of sediment. To account for an unknown loss of surface sediments during \n\ngravity coring, we aligned the depth of gravity cores obtained from Capt. Arutyunov and \n\nBonjardim MV according to the vertical sulphate profiles of MUC-cores recovered from one 10 \n\nsite, assuming that sulphate concentrations are mainly a function of depth in proximate cores. \n\nAccording to this procedure, the top sediment horizons of the recovered gravity cores were 40 \n\nand 12.5 cm below seafloor at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV, respectively. Aligning \n\nproximate core sections is an approach to account for a loss of an unknown quantity of \n\nsurface sediments during gravity coring. However, this approach can be problematic if spatial 15 \n\nvariability of geochemical gradients is high. \n\nUpon recovery, gravity cores were sectioned into 1 m pieces and vertically cut in halves, prior \n\nto sub sampling. All cores were immediately transferred into a cold room and subsampled for \n\nconcentration measurements of volatile pore water constituents (methane, sulphate, sulphide), \n\nAOM and SR rate measurements according to Treude et al (2003, 2005), as well as for lipid 20 \n\nbiomarker and 16S rDNA analyses (Tab. 1). Sediments for measurements of methane and \n\nsulphate concentrations and turnover rate measurements were subsampled vertically with \n\npush cores (acrylic core liners, 26 mm diameter, n = 3) from MUC-cores. Gravity cores were \n\nsubsampled by plugging glass tubes (60 mm length, 10 mm diameter, n = 5) in selected \n\nsediment horizons. The tubes were then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers to allow for an 25 \n\nanaerobic incubation of the sediment plug. Sediment samples for pore water extraction, \n\n\n\n \n\n 9\n\nbiomarker and 16S rDNA analyses were collected from 2 cm sections of MUC cores and \n\nfrom selected horizons of gravity core sections. Directly after subsampling, pore water from \n\nthese sediment horizons was extracted by pressure filtration (5 bars) through Teflon squeezers \n\nprovided with 0.2 \u00b5m cellulose acetate filters according to previous works (Hensen et al., \n\n2003; Niew\u00f6hner et al., 1998). Subsequently, the pore water was immediately fixed (see next 5 \n\nsection). Lipid and DNA samples were stored in cleaned glass vials at \u201320\u00b0C until extraction \n\nin the home laboratory. Carbonate crusts from Hesperides and Faro MV were collected with a \n\nvideo guided grab-sampler (Tab.1). Upon recovery, carbonate crusts for lipid biomarker \n\nanalyses were transferred into plastic bags and stored at \u201320\u00b0C until extraction. \n\n 10 \n\n \n\n2.3. Methane Concentrations  \n\n \n\n Methane concentrations in sediments were determined according to the \u201chead space\u201d method \n\nfrom 5 ml sediment fixed with 25 ml NaOH (2.5%, w/v) in a diffusion-tight glass vial as 15 \n\ndescribed previously by Treude and co-workers (2003). A vertical resolution of 2 cm was \n\nchosen for MUC cores whereas for gravity cores, a vertical resolution of 20-30 cm was \n\nchosen.  Methane concentrations were determined shortly after the cruise (<2 month) using a \n\ngas chromatograph as described elsewhere (Treude et al., 2003). The chromatography system \n\nwas calibrated for a concentration range of 0.001 to 5 mM methane (final concentration in the 20 \n\nsediment). Sediment samples from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were additionally \n\nanalysed for the concentrations of the higher hydrocarbons (C2+) ethane, propane, isobutene \n\nand butane (?butane) using the above-described chromatography setting with a temperature \n\ngradient. Subsequent to injection at 40\u00b0C, the temperature was increased at a rate of 2\u00b0C min-1 \n\nto 200\u00b0C and held for 20 min. Identity and concentrations of methane and C2+-compounds 25 \n\nwere determined with standards of known hydrocarbon compositions. \n\n\n\n \n\n 10\n\n2.4. Sulphate and Sulphide Concentrations  \n\n \n\nStandard methods were applied for sulphate and sulphide analyses. Sulphide concentrations \n\nwere determined immediately after sampling by adding 1 ml of pore water to 50 \u00b5l of a zinc \n\nacetate gelatine solution. Sulphide was quantitatively removed as ZnS and kept in colloidal 5 \n\nsolution. After adding a colour reagent the concentration was determined photometrically by \n\nmeasuring the absorbance after 1 hour at 670 nm (see more detailed descriptions at \n\nhttp://www.geomar.de/zd/labs/labore_umwelt/Analytik.html). Sulphate concentrations were \n\ndetermined on 2 ml sub-samples of filtered pore water using a Sykom-S ion chromatography \n\nsystem. Samples were diluted by 1:54 with the eluent (7.5 mM Na2CO3-solution).  10 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5. Diffusive Flux Calculations \n\n \n\n Local fluxes (J) were calculated from the vertical profiles of pore water constituents 15 \n\n(methane, sulphate, sulphide) according to Fick\u2019s first law of diffusion assuming steady state \n\nconditions (e.g. Niew\u00f6hner et al., 1998 and references therein), \n\nx\nC\n\nD -  J  s ?\n?\n\n?=               (1) \n\nwhere Ds is the diffusion coefficient in the sediments, ?  the porosity and \nx\nC\n?\n?\n\n the local \n\nconcentration gradient (in cm-4). Ds was determined from the molecular diffusion coefficient 20 \n\nafter Boudreau (1997).  \n\n2\n0\n\ns )ln(-1\nD\n\n  D\n?\n\n=               (2) \n\nFor each mud volcano, D0 values were corrected for temperature (3 to 12\u00b0C, depending on the \n\nactual bottom water temperature), resulting in values ranging between 291 to 392, 178 to 244 \n\n\n\n \n\n 11\n\nand 356 to 434 for methane, sulphate and sulphide, respectively (Boudreau, 1997). ?  was \n\ndetermined from the weight loss per volume of wet sediment after drying to stable weight at \n\n60oC. In general, ?  decreased with depth showing values of 57 - 76% in the top sections and \n\n51 - 60% in the bottom sections of the retrieved MUCs and GCs (data shown for the SMT, \n\nTab. 2).  5 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6. Ex-situ AOM and SR Rate Measurements  \n\n \n\nSediment for turnover rate measurements recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim 10 \n\nMV were incubated on board according to previously described methods (Treude et al., 2003; \n\nTreude et al., 2005). Briefly, 25\u00b5l 14CH4 (dissolved in water, 2.5 kBq) or 5 \u00b5l 35SO42- tracer \n\n(dissolved in water, 50 kBq) were injected into butyl rubber sealed glass tubes from gravity \n\ncore sub-sampling and in 1 cm intervals into small push cores (whole core injection) used for \n\nMUC sub-sampling. Incubation was carried out for 24 h at in situ temperature in the dark. 15 \n\nSubsequently, incubated AOM and SR rate samples were fixed in 25 ml NaOH (2.5%, w/v) \n\nand 25 ml zinc acetate solution (20%, w/v), respectively. Further processing of AOM and SR \n\nrate samples was performed according to Treude et al  (2003) and references therein. \n\nTurnover rates were calculated according to the following formulas:  \n\n 20 \n\nTime incubat.\nCH conc.\n\nCOCH\nCO\n\nAOM 4\n2\n\n14\n4\n\n14\n2\n\n14\n\n\u00d7\n+\n\n=            (3) \n\nTime incubat.\nSO conc.\n\nSTRISO\nSTRI\n\nSRR\n2\n\n4\n352\n\n4\n35\n\n35 ?\n\n?\n\u00d7\n\n+\n=            (4) \n\n \n \nHere, 14CO2, 35SO42- and TRI35S are the activities  (Bq) of carbon dioxide, sulphate and total 25 \n\nreduced sulphur species, respectively, whereas conc. CH4 and conc. SO42- are the \n\nconcentrations of methane and sulphate at the beginning of the incubation. To compare ex situ \n\n\n\n \n\n 12\n\nmicrobial rates with the diffusive fluxes of methane and sulphate, AOM and SR rates were \n\nintegrated over depth in cores 9036-2 and 9051-2, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7. Extraction of Sediment and Carbonate Samples and Preparation of Derivates 5 \n\n \n\n Sediments from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV as well as carbonate crusts from \n\nHesperides and Faro MV were analysed for lipid biomarker signatures. The extraction \n\nprocedure and preparation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) was carried out according to \n\nElvert et al. (2003). Briefly, total lipid extracts (TLE) were obtained from ca. 20 g of wet 10 \n\nsediment and from authigenic carbonates disintegrated with HCL (2M) prior to extraction. \n\nThe TLE was extracted by subsequent ultrasonication using organic solvents of decreasing \n\npolarity. Internal standards of known concentration and carbon isotopic compositions were \n\nadded prior to extraction. Fatty acid moieties present in glyco and phospholipids were cleaved \n\nby saponification with methanolic KOH-solution. After extraction of the neutral lipid fraction 15 \n\nfrom this mixture, fatty acids (FAs) were methylated with BF3 in methanol yielding FAMES. \n\nDouble bond positions of monoenoic FAs were determined by analysis of dimethyl disulphide \n\nadducts according to methods described elsewhere (Moss and Lambert-Fair, 1989; Nichols et \n\nal., 1986). \n\nNeutral lipids were further separated into hydrocarbons, ketones and alcohols on a SPE silica 20 \n\nglass cartridge (0.5 g packing) with solvents (5 ml each) of increasing polarity (n-\n\nhexane/dichloromethane (95:5, v/v), n-hexane/dichloromethane (2:1, v/v), \n\ndichloromethane/acetone (9:1, v/v)). Alcohols were derivatised with \n\nbis(trimethylsilyl)triflouracetamid (BSTFA) forming trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers prior to \n\nanalyses.  25 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 13\n\n2.8. Gas Chromatography  \n\n \n\nConcentrations of single lipid compounds were determined by gas chromatography analysis \n\nusing a Varian 30 m apolar CP-Sil 8 CB fused silica capillary (0.25 mm internal diameter \n\n[ID], film thickness 0.25 \u00b5m) in a Hewlett Packard 6890 Series gas chromatograph equipped 5 \n\nwith an on column injector and a flame ionisation detector. Initial Oven temperature was \n\n80\u00b0C. Subsequently to injection, the initial temperature was increased to 130\u00b0C at a rate of \n\n20\u00b0C min-1, then raised to 320\u00b0C at a rate of 4\u00b0C min and held at 320\u00b0C for 30 min. The \n\ncarrier was helium at a constant flow of 2 ml min-1 and the detector temperature was set to \n\n310 \u00b0C. Concentrations were calculated relative to internal standards present within the 10 \n\nrespective lipid fraction.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.9. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Gas Chromatography-Isotope \n\nRatio Mass Spectrometry (GC-IRMS) 15 \n\n \n\n Identity and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual compounds were determined by GC-\n\nMS and GC-IRMS analysis, respectively. Instrument specifications and operation modes of \n\nthe GC-MS and GC-IRMS units were set according to Elvert et al. (2003). Identities of \n\nacquired mass spectra were compared to known standards and published data. Stable isotope 20 \n\nratios are given in the ?-notation against Pee Dee Belemite. ?13C-values of FAs and alcohols \n\nwere corrected for the introduction of additional carbon atoms during derivatisation. Internal \n\nstandards were used to monitor precision and reproducibility during measurements. Reported \n\n?13C-values have an analytical error of \u00b11\u2030. \n\n 25 \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 14\n\n2.10. DNA extraction and clone library construction \n\n \n\n Total community DNA was extracted from sediments (ca. 1 g) collected from the SMT of \n\nCapt. Arutyunov MV (30-40 cm) using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (Q-Biogene, Irvine, \n\nCalifornia, USA). Samples were bead-beat in a Fastprep machine (Q-Biogene, Irvine, 5 \n\nCalifornia, USA) at speed 4.5 for 30 seconds. All other steps in the DNA extraction procedure \n\nwere preformed according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Almost full-length \n\narchaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified from sediments samples using the \n\nprimers 20f (Massana et al., 1997) and Uni1392R (Lane et al., 1985) for archaea and GM3F \n\n(Muyzer et al., 1995) and GM4R (Kane et al., 1993) for bacteria. Polymerase chain reactions 10 \n\n(PCRs) were performed with TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Otsu Japan), using 2.5 U of enzyme, \n\n1X Buffer, 4 mM of MgCl2, 4 mM of each dNTP, 1 \u00b5M of each primer and 2 \u00b5l of template \n\nin a 50 \u00b5l reaction. PCR reactions were preformed in a Mastercycler machine (Eppendorf, \n\nHamburg, Germany), with the following cycling conditions: 95\u00b0C for two minutes, then 30 \n\ncycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C (archaea) or 50\u00b0C (bacteria) for 30 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 15 \n\n3 minutes, followed by a final incubation step at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. PCR products were \n\nvisualized on an agarose gel, and the 16S band excised. PCR products were purified using the \n\nQIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Two microliters of purified DNA \n\nwere ligated in the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and transformed into \n\ncompetent E. coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s 20 \n\nrecommendations. Transformation reactions were plated on LB-agarose plates. Overnight \n\ncultures were prepared from individual colonies picked from these plates using the Montage \n\nPlasmid Miniprep 96 kit (Millipore, Billerica, USA). Purified plasmids were sequenced in one \n\ndirection, with either the 958R (archea) or GM1F (bacteria) primers using the BigDye \n\nTerminator v3.0 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Samples 25 \n\nwere sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3100 Genetic Analyser (Foster City, USA). A total \n\n\n\n \n\n 15\n\nof 39 archaeal and 47 bacterial clones were partially sequenced (~ 0.5 kb). Using the ARB \n\nsoftware package, the sequences were calculated into existing phylogentic trees by parsimony \n\nwithout allowing a change in the tree topology. Representative sequences of each cluster were \n\nthen fully sequenced (~1.3 kb) and matched against the NCBI data base \n\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Sequences were submitted to the Genbank database 5 \n\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and are accessible under the following accession numbers: \n\nDQ004661 to DQ004676 and DQ004678 to DQ004680. \n\n \n\n \n\n 10 \n\n3. RESULTS \n\n \n\n3.1. Field Observations   \n\n \n\nA detailed description of sea floor video observations, sedimentology and sampling locations 15 \n\nis provided in the report of R/V SONNE cruise SO-175 (Kopf et al., 2004). The mud \n\nvolcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini, and Faro studied here are cone \n\nshaped with a relief of up to 200 m and a maximum diameter of 4.9 km kilometres (Fig. 2a,b; \n\nTab.1). Hesperides MV has comparable dimensions but is composed of 6 single cones. A new \n\nstructure was discovered east of the TTR MV and termed \u201cNo Name\u201d (Fig. 1). Video 20 \n\nobservations of the mud volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Hesperides, and \n\nFaro could not reveal indications for recent gas, fluid or mud expulsion (2-3 tran-sects with a \n\ntotal bottom observation time of approximately 8 hrs per mud volcano, Kopf et al., 2004). The \n\ncentral craters of Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim and Ginsburg MV were covered with light \n\nbeige sediments (shown for Capt. Arutyunov MV, Fig. 3a). At Capt. Arutyunov MV, some 25 \n\nsediment stretches were scattered with accretions, interpreted as clasts, which may indicate \n\n\n\n \n\n 16\n\npast mud flows (Fig. 3b). At Ginsburg MV, a few small carbonate crusts (<0.5 m) were \n\nobserved on the seafloor. Beside these observations, no other distinctive sedimentological or \n\nbiological features indicating gas or fluid seepage were visible on video images at Ginsburg. \n\nSurface sediments recovered from Capt. Arutyunov MV contained small tubeworms \n\n(diameter&lt;<1 mm), which extended down to 20 cm into the sediment. Tube worms usually 5 \n\nharbour methane- or sulphide oxidising symbionts, indicating sulphide and/or methane \n\navailability in the sediments (Kimura et al., 2003; Schmaljohann and Flugel, 1987; Sibuet and \n\nOlu, 1998; Southward et al., 1986; Southward et al., 1981). The central areas of Hesperides \n\nand Faro MV were littered with fragments of carbonate chimneys and carbonate crusts \n\n(shown for Hesperides MV, Fig. 3c). Both, chimneys and crusts were ranging in size from 10 \n\nseveral centimetres to meters in length and diameter. At Faro MV, a few, small patches \n\ncovered with microbial mats possibly consisting of filamentous sulphide oxidising bacteria \n\nwere observed (Fig. 3d). Moreover, grab samples recovered from this MV also contained a \n\nfew specimens of the chemosynthetic clam Acharax sp. usually harbouring sulphide oxidising \n\nbacteria in their gills (Felbeck, 1983; Krueger and Cavanaugh, 1997; Peek et al., 1998; Sibuet 15 \n\nand Olu, 1998). Video observations were not carried out at Gemini MV and the \u201cNo Name\u201d \n\nstructure. The MUC-cores retrieved from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV contained \n\nyellowish, muddy sediments in the top sections at 0-20 and 0-40 cm below sea floor (bsf), \n\nrespectively. The bottom sections of the MUC-cores contained mud breccia. The gravity cores \n\nretrieved from these MVs as well as those retrieved from Ginsburg and Gemini also contained 20 \n\nmud breccia. In contrast to the MUC-cores recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim \n\nMV, the mud breccia in all of the retrieved gravity cores was only covered by a thin layer \n\n(max. 10 cm) of yellowish mud. This directly indicates a loss of the beige surface sediments \n\nduring sediment sampling and core retrieval. The gravity core recovered from the \u201cNo Name\u201d \n\nstructure contained a matrix of cold water coral fragments and greyish mud. It has to be 25 \n\nfurther investigated if this structure is a mud volcano or a mud diapir. Grab samples from \n\n\n\n \n\n 17\n\nHesperides and Faro MV contained carbonate fragments and mud breccia. After recovery, the \n\ntemperature in the top sediment section (~1 m) at Bonjardim MV was ca. 3\u00b0C. In contrast, the \n\ntemperature was considerably higher at Capt. Arutyunov  (12\u00b0C), Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV \n\nand the \u201cNo Name\u201d structure (10\u00b0C, respectively) most probably as a result of the warm \n\nMediterranean outflow water, which contributes to the bottom water at these MVs.   5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Captain Arutyunov Mud Volcano \n\n 10 \n3.2.1. Methane, C2+, Sulphate and Sulphide  \n\n \n\nMethane concentrations in surface sediments (0-20 cm, Fig. 4a) were&lt;0.001 mM indicating a \n\ncomplete consumption of methane rising from deeper sediment strata. A distinct SMT was \n\nobserved in the lower half of the MUC-core section (25 - 40 cm bsf.). The steepest gradients 15 \n\nof methane and sulphate amounted to 0.4 and \u20131.12 \u00b5mol cm-4, respectively (Fig. 4a, Tab. 2). \n\nSmall gas hydrate chips were found throughout the whole gravity core section from 44 to 235 \n\ncm bsf (1941-1). Probably, gas hydrates were also present in the lower section of the MUC-\n\ncore (9036-2) but dissociated upon core recovery and sediment subsampling. Similar to \n\nmethane, concentrations of C2+-compounds decreased across the SMT (Fig. 4b). 20 \n\nHydrocarbons in the sediment porewaters comprised methane (> 99%), ethane (<0.4%), \n\npropane (<0.07%) with trace amounts of butane and isobutene present. Sulphide \n\nconcentrations peaked in the SMT with 4.8 mM at 39 cm bsf (Fig. 4d). The steepest sulphide \n\ngradient was 0.63 \u00b5mol cm-4 (Fig. 4d, Tab. 2). A downward sulphide gradient could not be \n\ndetermined because highest sulphide concentrations were observed in the lowest sediment 25 \n\n\n\n \n\n 18\n\nhorizon of the MUC-core at Capt. Arutyunov MV. Unfortunately, the sulphide profile could \n\nnot be aligned continuously with the gravity core section. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2. AOM, SR Rates and Diffusive Fluxes  5 \n\n \n\nAOM and SR rates at Capt. Arutyunov MV were highest in the SMT at 39 cm bsf with \n\nmaximum values of 11 and 25 nmol cm-3 d-1, respectively (Fig. 4c). AOM and SR rates \n\nsharply decreased above and below this horizon. A 1.8-fold higher areal SR compared to \n\nAOM indicates an additional electron donor fuelling sulphate reduction (Tab. 2). The areal 10 \n\nAOM and SR rate were in good agreement with diffusive fluxes showing a 1.7-fold higher \n\nsulphate flux compared to the methane flux. The sulphide flux to the surface (upward flux) \n\nwas comparable to the total downward flux of sulphate (Tab. 2).  \n\n \n\n 15 \n\n3.2.3. Lipid Biomarker \n\n \n\nDiagnostic archaeal and bacterial lipid concentrations were strongly increased in sediments at \n\nthe SMT (Fig. 4c,e). At this horizon (-31 cm), stable carbon isotope analysis revealed highest \n\ndepletion in 13C with minimum values of \u201392\u2030 (sn2-hydroxyarchaeol) in archaeal specific 20 \n\ndiether lipids and \u201382\u2030 (cyC17:0?5,6) in bacterial specific FAs (Tab. 3, Fig. 4d,e). The \n\nconcentration of both archaeal and bacterial lipids decreased just above and below this \n\nsediment horizon. At the SMT, the ratio of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol was 1.6:1 \n\n(Tab. 3). Other diagnostic, archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons such as 2,6,11,15-\n\ntetramethylhexadecane (crocetane) could not be measured due to an unresolved complex 25 \n\nmixture in all of the hydrocarbon fractions. Similarly, specific archaeal diethers and bacterial \n\n\n\n \n\n 19\n\nFAs could not be resolved from this background below 40 cm sediment depth. The \n\nconcentrations of diagnostic archaeal lipids were roughly one order of magnitude lower in \n\ncomparison to specific bacterial FAs. \n\nThe FA fraction in sediments at the SMT was dominated by C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6 and \n\ncontained  comparably high amounts of FA C17:1?6 (Tab. 3). Both, C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6 were 5 \n\nthe most 13C-depleted FAs. However, all other FAs in the C14 to C17 range carried \n\nsignificantly  13C-depleted  isotope  signatures  as  well  with  values  ranging  between  -65\u2030  \n\n (C16:1?9) to \u201375\u2030 (C14:0). C18-FAs were comparably enriched in 13C as shown by ?13C -\n\nvalues ranging between -25\u2030 (C18:0) to -31\u2030 (C18:1?7) most likely indicating a planktonic \n\norigin of these compounds. Concentrations of mono- and di-alkyl glycerol ethers (MAGEs 10 \n\nand DAGEs, respectively) presumably of bacterial origin were low in all samples recovered \n\nduring cruise SO-175. Thus, a detailed analysis of these compounds was not carried out. \n\nHowever, sediments at the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov Mud Volcano comprised comparably \n\nhigh contents of MAGEs relative to DAGES with ?13C values ranging from \u201365\u2030 to -85\u2030 \n\n(data not shown). The MAGEs comprised a suite of alkyl moieties, which is comparable to 15 \n\nthose of the fatty acids found at Capt. Arutyunov MV. The suite of fatty acids extracted from \n\nthe tube worms comprised dominant amounts of the FAs C16:1?7 and C18:1?7 and to a lesser \n\ndegree C16:0 and C18:0 with uniform ?13C-values of about -40\u2030, indicating chemoautotrophic \n\ncarbon fixation (data not shown). The alcohol and hydrocarbon fractions were not analysed.  \n\n 20 \n\n \n\n3.2.4. Phylogenetic diversity  \n\n \n\n Two clone libraries, one archaeal and one bacterial, were constructed to study the 16S rDNA-\n\nbased microbial diversity in sediments at the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov  MV (30-40 cm bsf). 25 \n\nThe 16S rDNA archaeal clone library consisted of 9 phylogenetic groups (Tab. 4). Closest \n\n\n\n \n\n 20\n\nrelatives of these groups were found among seep-endemic, uncultured archaea and bacteria. \n\nThe majority of sequences obtained were related to the ANME-2 group (59% ANME-2a, 3% \n\nANME-2c of all archaeal sequences) which is known to mediate AOM (Boetius et al., 2000; \n\nKnittel et al., 2005; Orphan et al., 2002). The second most abundant group (18% of all \n\narchaeal sequences) was found to belong to the ANME-1 cluster which is also known to 5 \n\nmediate AOM (Hinrichs et al., 1999; Michaelis et al., 2002; Orphan et al., 2002). The \n\nbacterial clone library consisted of 10 uncultivated bacterial lineages. Similar to the archaeal \n\nsequences, the next relatives of all bacterial 16S rDNA sequences belonged to uncultivated \n\norganisms that are commonly found at methane seeps (Knittel et al., 2003, Tab. 4). The \n\nclosest relatives of the most abundant cluster of sequences (81%) belonged to the Seep-SRB1 10 \n\ngroup which comprises the bacterial partners of ANME-1 and ANME-2 (Knittel et al., 2003). \n\nOther phylogenetic groups of bacteria were represented by single clone sequences (<2%).  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Bonjardim MV 15 \n\n \n\n3.3.1. Methane, C2+, Sulphate and Sulphide  \n\n \n\n A distinct SMT was observed in the top meter of the gravity core section. After alignment \n\nwith the MUC-core section, the actual depth of the SMT was determined between 45 and 70 20 \n\ncm bsf (Fig. 5a). As the two core sections overlap, the concentration gradients can be \n\ndetermined from the gravity core section alone or from aligned profiles in the overlapping \n\nzone (Fig. 5a,d). Here, we used both approaches in order to investigate the potential range for \n\nthe diffusive fluxes. The steepest methane and sulphate gradients in the gravity core section \n\nwere determined with 0.09 and \u20130.76 \u00b5mol cm-4, respectively (Fig. 5a, Tab. 2). Aligning the 25 \n\ngravity core and MUC-core sections, the steepest sulphate gradient was \u20131.67 \u00b5mol cm-4. \n\n\n\n \n\n 21\n\nMethane concentrations declined below the depth at which the two core sections overlap. \n\nHence, no concentration gradient from core alignments was possible. Methane concentrations \n\nin surface sediments (0 \u2013 52 cm sediment depth) were&lt;0.001 mM indicating a complete \n\nconsumption of methane in the SMT. C2+-concentrations were comparably high with values \n\nof >0.25 mM at a sediment depth below 1 m (Fig. 5b). Similar to methane, concentrations of 5 \n\nC2+-compounds decreased across the SMT (Fig. 5b) indicating a consumption of these \n\ncompounds. Gaseous hydrocarbons comprised methane (>81%), ethane (<14%), propane \n\n(<4.5%) and ?butane (<0.4%). Sulphide concentrations peaked in the SMT with 5.3 mM at \n\n52.5 cm bsf (Fig. 5d). In the gravity core section, the steepest sulphide gradients were \n\ndetermined with 0.23 (upward) and \u20130.07 (downward) \u00b5mol cm-4, respectively (Tab. 2). 10 \n\nAligning the two core sections, the steepest (upward) sulphide gradient was determined with \n\n0.73 \u00b5mol cm-4. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.2. AOM, SR Rates and Diffusive Fluxes  15 \n\n \n\nAOM and SR rates were highest in the SMT at 58 cm bsf with maximum values of 2.6 and \n\n15.4 nmol cm-3 d-1, respectively. Comparably low values of AOM and SR rates were \n\nmeasured in over- and underlying sediment horizons. A 19.3-fold higher areal SR compared \n\nto AOM indicates a decoupling of these two processes (Tab. 2). Considering both 20 \n\nconcentration gradients (determined from unaligned and aligned profiles), the diffusive \n\ndownward flux of sulphate was 5.1- to 11-fold higher compared to the upward methane flux. \n\nSimilarly, the cumulative sulphide flux (upward and downward) accounted for 77% to 92% of \n\nthe sulphate flux. \n\n 25 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 22\n\n3.3.3. Lipid Biomarker \n\n \n\nA moderate increase of diagnostic archaeal and bacterial lipid concentrations was observed at \n\nthe SMT in sediments of Bonjardim MV (Fig. 5c,e). At this horizon (-57 cm), stable carbon \n\nisotope analysis revealed highest depletions in 13C with minimum values of \u201383\u2030 (sn2-5 \n\nhydroxyarchaeol) in archaeal diether lipids and \u201349\u2030 (C16:1?5) in bacterial FAs (Tab. 3, Fig. \n\n5d,e). At the SMT, the ratio of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol was 0.7:1 and \n\ntherefore lower in comparison to Capt. Arutyunov MV (Tab. 3). Similar to Capt. Arutyunov \n\nMV, other diagnostic archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons could not be measured due to a high \n\nbackground from an unresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons. Equally high amounts of 10 \n\nthe FAs C16:1?5 and ai-C15:0, both of which were the most 13C-depleted FAs (Tab. 3), were \n\ndetected in sediments at the SMT. The FA cyC17:0?5,6, which was abundant at Capt. \n\nArutyunov MV could not be detected in sediments of Bonjardim MV. Furthermore, dominant \n\nFAs such as C16:1?7, C16:0, C18:1?9 and C18:1?7 carried ?13C-signatures ?-34\u2030, indicating that \n\nthese compounds are derived from processes other than  AOM.  In  contrast  to  Capt. 15 \n\nArutyunov  MV,  the  concentrations of diagnostic archaeal  \n\nlipids were roughly 4-fold higher compared to specific bacterial FAs (Tab. 3). A further \n\nanalysis of the diversity of microbial organism using 16S rDNA methods was not carried out \n\nat Bonjardim MV.  \n\n 20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 25 \n\n\n\n \n\n 23\n\n3.4. Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and \u201cNo Name\u201d  \n\n \n3.4.1. Methane, Sulphate and Sulphide \n\n \n\nThe SMT was located in the upper metre of the sediment cores retrieved from Ginsburg and 5 \n\nGemini MV and at 2-3 m bsf at the \u201cNo Name\u201d structure, respectively (Fig. 6a, c, e). Methane \n\nconcentrations in sediments overlying the SMT at these structures were&lt;0.001 mM. \n\nSediments retrieved from Ginsburg MV had a distinct smell of petroleum with depth  below  \n\n40 cm.  No  depth  corrections were made as only gravity cores were taken from these MVs. \n\nThe actual depth of the SMTs was therefore most likely 10 to 40 cm below the sediment 10 \n\ndepth indicated in figure 6. In contrast to the observed depletion of sulphate below the SMT at \n\nGemini MV and the \u201cNo Name\u201d structure, sulphate concentrations showed a minimum \n\nbetween 30 to 70 cm and an increase to values ?17 mM with depth below 90 cm at Ginsburg \n\nMV. The total, diffusive sulphate flux was therefore calculated from both, the upward and the \n\ndownward gradients at Ginsburg MV. At Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the \u201cNo Name\u201d 15 \n\nstructure, methane and downward sulphate gradients ranged from 0.02 to 0.05 and \u20130.11 to -\n\n0.92 \u00b5mol cm-4, respectively (Tab. 2). The upward sulphate gradient at Ginsburg MV was \n\n0.35 \u00b5mol cm-4. Sulphide concentrations peaked in the SMT with values between 4.7 to 7.6 \n\nmM and steepest gradients were determined with values between 0.04 to 0.32 (upward) and \u2013\n\n0.06 to \u20130.15 (downward) \u00b5mol cm-4, respectively (Tab. 2). 20 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4.2.

This gives \n\n\n\n \n\n 24\n\nevidence for a decoupling of AOM and SR at these structures similar to the observations \n\nmade at Bonjardim MV  (Tab. 2). The cumulative (upward + downward) sulphide flux \n\naccounted for 66, 70 and 146% of the sulphate fluxes at Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the \n\n\u201cNo Name\u201d structure, respectively. The composition of the microbial community was not \n\ninvestigated here. 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5. Lipid biomarkers of carbonate crusts  \n\n \nExposed carbonate crusts were observed at the mud volcanoes Ginsburg, Hesperides and 10 \n\nFaro. Additionally, high amounts of broken carbonate chimneys were found at Hesperides and \n\nFaro MV. Both crusts and chimneypieces were absent at Capt. Arutyunov MV, Bonjardim \n\nMV and the \u201cNo Name\u201d structure according to our visual inspections.  We could retrieve \n\ncrust samples from the summits of Hesperides and Faro MV for further analyses of the lipid \n\nsignatures of the crusts.  15 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5.1. Hesperides MV \n\n \n\nCarbonate crusts of Hesperides MV contained archaeal and bacterial lipids diagnostic for 20 \n\nmethanotrophic communities and processes. Archaeal lipids were strongly depleted in ?13C \n\nwith minimum values of \u201397\u2030 (archaeol) whereas bacterial FAs were only moderately \n\ndepleted with minimum values of \u201343\u2030 (ai-C15:0, Tab. 3). Only trace amounts of sn2-\n\nhydroxyarchaeol were detected among the archaeal diethers. Isoprenoidal hydrocarbons were \n\ndominated by 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI:0) and contained comparably low 25 \n\namounts of a crocetane / 2,6,10,14-tetramethylhexadecane (phytane) mixture and ?PMI:1 \n\n\n\n \n\n 25\n\n(comprising 2 isomers). The FA fraction in the carbonate was dominated by C16:0 followed by \n\nC18:0 with ?13C-values >-28\u2030 (Tab. 3). FAs putatively specific for SRB involved in AOM \n\nsuch   as   C16:1?5,   i-C15:0   and  ai-C15:0  (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2003),  were \n\napproximately 3 to 4.8 times lower in concentration compared to C16:0.  However, in contrast \n\nto abundant FAs, stable carbon isotope compositions of i-C15:0, ai-C15:0 and C16:1?5 showed a 5 \n\nmoderate depletion in 13C (Tab. 3). Moreover, in comparison to specific archaeal lipids, \n\ndiagnostic bacterial FAs were roughly an order of magnitude lower in concentration.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5.2. Faro MV  10 \n\n \n\nAll archaeal and bacterial lipids found in carbonate crusts of Faro MV were strongly depleted \n\nin 13C (Tab. 3). Stable carbon isotope analysis revealed minimum ?13C values of \u2013114\u2030 \n\n(archaeol) in diagnostic archaeal diether lipids and \u201399\u2030 (i-C15:0) in specific bacterial FAs \n\n(Tab. 3). Archaeal diether lipids were dominated by archaeol and contained comparably low 15 \n\namounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol. Isoprenoidal hydrocarbons were dominated by PMI:2 (9 \n\nisomers) followed by PMI:1 (2 isomers) and relatively high amounts of crocetane/phytane. \n\nSpecific FAs showed comparably small differences in abundance and ?13C-values (Tab. 3). \n\nHowever, ai-C15:0 was the most dominant FA with a roughly 2-fold higher concentration \n\ncompared to i-C15:0 and C16:1?5. The FA cyC17:0?5,6 was not detected. Concentrations of 20 \n\nspecific FAs were comparable to specific archaeal lipids. \n\n \n \n \n\n 25 \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 26\n\n4. DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1. Methane-Driven Geochemical and Biological Activity at the Mud Volcanoes of the \n\nGulf of Cadiz 5 \n\n \n\nMarine mud volcanoes have been identified as an important escape pathway of reduced \n\nhydrocarbon gases and may therefore contribute significantly to atmospheric green house \n\ngases (Dimitrov, 2002; Dimitrov, 2003; Judd et al., 2002; Kopf, 2002). Methane venting at \n\nsuch cold seeps provides an energy source for methanotrophic microbes which in turn may 10 \n\nsupport enormous biomasses of seep-related macrofauna and thiotrophic, giant bacteria \n\n(Boetius and Suess, 2004; Cordes et al., 2005; Milkov et al., 2004; Olu et al., 1997; Sahling et \n\nal., 2002; Werne et al., 2002). Furthermore, methane venting is often associated with \n\nauthigenic carbonates (Aloisi et al., 2000; Hensen et al., 2004; Kopf, 2002). The Gulf of \n\nCadiz is characterised by numerous mud volcanoes which have been intensely surveyed since 15 \n\ntheir discovery in 1999 (Kenyon et al., 2001; Kenyon et al., 2000; Pinheiro et al., 2003; \n\nSomoza et al., 2002). Among the findings indicative of past and present methane venting at \n\nseveral mud volcanoes are the occurrence of hydrate-bearing sediments, authigenic carbonates \n\nand seep related biota (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003; Gardner, 2001; Pinheiro et al., 2003; \n\nSomoza et al., 2003). Yet, the present activity of these structures in methane emission to the 20 \n\natmosphere remained unknown. Direct sea floor observations during cruise SO-175 revealed \n\nonly few traces of methane seepage at the centres of the mud volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, \n\nBonjardim, Ginsburg and Hesperides, and the \u201cNo Name\u201d structure. No visible fluid or gas \n\nescape was detected with video observations, indicating that the mud volcanoes may be \n\nrelatively inactive and that methane is completely consumed within subsurface sediment 25 \n\nhorizons. In contrast, highly active seep systems such as Hydrate Ridge, the Gulf of Mexico \n\n\n\n \n\n 27\n\nor H\u00e5kon Mosby Mud Volcano discharge methane into the hydrosphere through focused gas \n\nand fluid escape pathways, despite the high methane and sulphate turnover rates controlling \n\nsubstantial fractions of the methane flux (Boetius et al., 2000; Damm and Budeus, 2003; Joye \n\net al., 2004; Treude et al., 2003).  \n\nThe high anaerobic methane turnover at active seeps produces high sulphide fluxes, which are 5 \n\nutilized by thiotrophic communities, e.g. mats of giant bacteria like Beggiatoa sp., various \n\nchemosynthetic bivalves like Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp., Bathymodiolus sp. and by several \n\ntubeworm species (Sibuet and Olu, 1998). These organisms are adapted to different \n\ngeochemical settings and can be used as indicators for high methane fluxes and turnover in \n\nsubsurface or near surface sediments. Three types of indicator communities were so far 10 \n\nobserved at low abundances at the investigated mud volcanoes. Some small (ca. 20 cm \n\ndiameter) blackish sediment patches covered with bacterial mats were found at Faro MV \n\nindicating locally elevated fluxes of methane and sulphide, which reach the surface of the \n\nseafloor (Fig. 6d). Few specimen of the deep dwelling thiotrophic bivalve Acharax sp.  were \n\nrecovered from Faro MV and previously from Ginsburg MV (Gardner, 2001). Members of 15 \n\nthe family Solemyidae are mostly deep burrowing and occur in seep habitats with low or \n\nmoderate methane and sulphide fluxes where they can take up sulphide through their foot \n\nfrom subsurface accumulations (Sahling et al., 2002; Sibuet and Olu, 1998; Treude et al., \n\n2003). At Hydrate Ridge for instance, Acharax sp. mines subsurface sediments for sulphide \n\npockets below 15 cm sediment depth (Sahling et al., 2002). As a third indicator species, tube 20 \n\nworms were recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and previously observed at Bonjardim MV \n\n(Pinheiro et al., 2003). Tube worms can extend their roots very deep into sediments to profit \n\nfrom subsurface methane and/or sulphide accumulations (Dando et al., 1994; Gebruk et al., \n\n2003; Southward et al., 1981). At Capt. Arutyunov MV, the moderate depletion of worm-\n\nderived membrane lipids indicates a thiotrophic feeding mode fuelled by AOM-derived 25 \n\nsulphide rather than an aerobic methanotrophic mode.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 28\n\n4.2. Hotspots of hydrocarbon turnover at the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz  \n\n \n\nThe observed patterns of seep related biota is in good agreement with the observed \n\ngeochemical gradients. All mud volcanoes investigated here showed a complete depletion of \n\nmethane within the SMT. Elevated and corresponding AOM and SR rates within this zone 5 \n\ngive evidence that uprising methane is consumed anaerobically with sulphate by \n\nmethanotrophic, microbial communities leading to a depletion of the two compounds in \n\nsediments of Capt. Arutyunov MV and Bonjardim MV at 25 to 40 cm and 45 to 70 cm bsf, \n\nrespectively (Fig. 4a, 5a). Accordingly, concentration measurements of methane and sulphate \n\nand the resulting estimates of diffusive methane and sulphate fluxes at Ginsburg MV, Gemini 10 \n\nMV and the \u201cNo Name\u201d structure indicate that sulphate-dependent AOM is a wide spread \n\nmicrobial process in the centres of the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz. With respect to \n\nmethane fluxes and microbial turnover rates at the time of our investigation, Capt. Arutyunov \n\nMV is the most active of the investigated structures followed by Bonjardim, Ginsburg and \n\nGemini MV, while  \u201cNo Name\u201d is the least active structure (Tab. 2). Furthermore, highest 15 \n\nturnover rates and fluxes coincided with the shallowest SMT comparing all investigated MVs. \n\nHence, compared to other marine gas seeps and methane-rich environments, the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nMVs investigated here showed a low or medium range in methane turnover rates, reflecting \n\nthe relatively low methane fluxes. At the Namibian Shelf, the north western Black Sea Shelf \n\nand the western Argentinean Basin for instance, the SMT is located several meters bsf and 20 \n\nmethane fluxes are low with values usually&lt;55 mmol m-2 yr-1 (Hensen et al., 2003; J\u00f8rgensen \n\net al., 2001; Niew\u00f6hner et al., 1998). These values are comparable to Ginsburg and Gemini \n\nMV as well as to the \u201cNo Name\u201d sructure. The AOM activity and diffusive methane fluxes at \n\nCapt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were substantially higher than those at Ginsburg MV, \n\nGemini MV and the \u201cNo Name\u201d structure. However, areal rates and diffusive fluxes at Capt. 25 \n\nArutyunov and Bonjardim MV are still two orders of magnitude lower in comparison to other \n\n\n\n \n\n 29\n\ncold seeps, which bear gas hydrates at their stability limit such as Hydrate Ridge and the Gulf \n\nof Mexico. In such environments with active fluid flow (>100 cm yr-1) and gas emission via \n\nebullition, methane fluxes were estimated with values >8.7 mol m-2 yr-1 (Luff and Wallmann, \n\n2003; Torres et al., 2002) and AOM reached values >4 mol m-2 yr-1, i.e. >0.5 \u00b5mol cm-3 d-1 \n\n(Joye et al., 2004; Treude et al., 2003).  5 \n\nAt Bonjardim MV, integrated SR rates agreed best with the sulphate flux calculated from the \n\naligned sulphate profile. Additionally, the deviation of integrated rates from diffusive fluxes \n\ncalculated from the gravity core alone could be caused by the much lower resolution of \n\nsubsamples taken from these cores. Integrated rate measurements were comparable to \n\ndiffusive fluxes at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV (Tab. 3). However, further modelling 10 \n\nis required to assess a potential advective transport component in order to estimate total \n\nfluxes. Also, the roughly s-shaped sulphate concentration profile from Ginsburg MV can not \n\nbe explained by a steady state, diffusive transport as this would require an additional sulphate \n\nsource at about 80 cm bsf.  \n\nIn vitro experiments with sediment slurries and ex situ tracer injection assays showed that 15 \n\nAOM and SR are in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry if methane is the sole carbon source (Nauhaus \n\net al., 2002; Treude et al., 2003). In spite of the disproportionate loss of methane and sulphate \n\ncaused by degassing during sampling, the deviation from the 1:1 stoichiometry between AOM \n\nand SR as well as between the sulphate and methane fluxes (Tab. 2) indicates the presence of \n\nelectron donors other than methane for SR at the investigated MVs. SRB can use a variety of 20 \n\nshort and long chain alkanes and complex aliphatic and aromatic compounds (Rueter et al., \n\n1994; Widdel and Rabus, 2001). The energy yield from the degradation of e.g. ethane coupled \n\nto sulphate reduction (reaction 4) is higher than syntrophic AOM (reaction 5) (refer to \n\nHanselmann et al., (1991) for Gf 0-values of the reactants).  \n\n 25 \n\n4C2H6 (aq) + 7SO42-(aq) ? 8HCO3-(aq) + 7HS-(aq) + 4H2O (l) + H+(aq), ?G0 = -279 kJ mol-1      (4) \n\n\n\n \n\n 30\n\nCH4 (aq) + SO42- (aq) ? HCO3- (aq) + HS-(aq) + H2O (l),  ?G0 = -33 kJ mol-1        (5) \n\n \n\nHence, it is possible that a substantial fraction of SR is fuelled by the anaerobic oxidation of \n\nC2+-compounds in sediments where methane and higher hydrocarbons co-occur. Besides the \n\npresent observations on C2+ compounds at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV, Mazurenko 5 \n\net al. (2003) observed a composition of hydrocarbon gases at Ginsburg MV, which is very \n\nsimilar to Bonjardim MV. The presence of substantial amounts of higher hydrocarbons in \n\nthese MVs, as well as the likely presence of petroleum in sediments of Ginsburg MV indicate \n\nthat methane is of a thermogenic origin in the Gulf of Cadiz, and that hydrocarbon-fuelled \n\nsulphate reduction could be an important microbial process in the sediments. Accordingly, 10 \n\nAOM explained a smaller fraction of SR at Bonjardim MV, which had a higher C2+ \n\nconcentration than Capt. Arutyunov MV (Fig. 4b-c, 5b-c, Tab. 2). This is comparable to \n\nprevious findings from the Gulf of Mexico where SR rates exceeds AOM rates up to 10-fold, \n\nmost likely due to the presence of a variety of hydrocarbons and petroleum in the sediments \n\n(Joye et al., 2004). The microbial hydrocarbon degraders at natural petroleum seeps have not 15 \n\nbeen identified yet.  \n\nAnother interesting, potentially microbial process is the oxidation of sulphide in anaerobic \n\nsediments just above and below the depth of the SMT (Fig. 4d-6d). At least at Capt. \n\nArutyunov MV, a biological control of the upward sulphide flux seems likely. At many seep \n\nsystems, the upward sulphide flux is utilized by thiotrophic organisms such as endosymbiotic 20 \n\nbacteria living in invertebrate organisms such as clams and tube worms (Felbeck, 1983; \n\nFisher, 1990; Sahling et al., 2002; Sibuet and Olu, 1998; Southward et al., 1986) and by \n\nvarious giant sulphide-oxidizing bacteria like Beggiatoa sp. and Thioploca sp. which can use \n\noxygen or nitrate as electron acceptors (Fossing et al., 1995; Huettel et al., 1996; Mussmann \n\net al., 2003; Nelson et al., 1982). At Capt. Arutyunov MV, the tubes of the worms extend to 25 \n\n20 cm. The upper horizon where sulphide consumption takes place is at 20 to 40 cm bsf, \n\n\n\n \n\n 31\n\nhence it seems likely that the worms and/or gliding bacteria can be responsible for this \n\nprocess. In contrast, it appears very unlikely that organisms depending on oxygen or nitrate \n\nutilise sulphide below the horizon where sulphide is produced. Here, a reaction of downward \n\ndiffusing sulphide with iron as proposed previously is a more likely explanation (Hensen et \n\nal., 2003; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2004).  5 \n\nIn conclusion, our biogeochemical measurements as well as biological and geological \n\nobservations indicate that the MVs studied during cruise SO-175 are currently not emitting \n\nmethane and other hydrocarbon gases to the hydrosphere. However, there is evidence for \n\nextensive fluid and/or gas escape in the past, as indicated by the widespread occurrence of \n\nmassive carbonate chimneys and crusts along or in close proximity to the main channels of 10 \n\nthe Mediterranean outflow water in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz (Diaz-del-Rio et al., \n\n2003; Somoza et al., 2003). Another geological evidence for temporally varying activities of \n\nmud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz are the typical \u201cChristmas tree\u201d structures observed on \n\nhigh-resolution seismic profiles (Somoza et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2002). Such patterns are \n\nprobably caused by eruptive events followed by phases of dormancy. This so-called 15 \n\nmultiphase activity is a common behaviour in many terrestrial mud volcanoes (e.g. Lokbatan \n\nMV; Aliyev et al., 2002; Dimitrov, 2003; Kholodov, 2002). It is therefore possible that mud \n\nvolcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz is in a transient state of low activity at present. \n\n \n\n 20 \n\n4.4. Identity of Methane Oxidising Communities in Sediments and Carbonate Crusts \n\n \n\nFingerprinting of diagnostic lipids is a common tool for the chemotaxonomic identification of \n\nmicro organisms  (Boschker and Middelburg, 2002; Madigan et al., 2000). This approach has \n\nbeen used extensively to examine anaerobic methanotrophic organisms, because the carbon 25 \n\nisotope fractionation associated with AOM leads to specific, very depleted ?13C-signatures of \n\n\n\n \n\n 32\n\nlipid biomarkers (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2001; Hinrichs et al., 1999). The \n\ndominance of bacterial and archaeal lipids with low ?13C-values in sediments and carbonates \n\nindicate that AOM is a dominant biomass-generating process at the explored MVs. \n\nDifferences in the abundances of specific archaeal isoprenoidal diethers and hydrocarbons and \n\nvarying contents of bacterial FAs, as well as varying ??13C values of these lipids (compared 5 \n\nto source methane) give evidence that several phylogenetic groups of methanotrophic \n\ncommunities mediate AOM in the Gulf of Cadiz. Elevated concentrations and associated low \n\n?13C-signatures of specific archaeal and bacterial membrane lipids corresponded with elevated \n\nAOM and SR rates in sediments of the SMT at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV (Fig. 4e-\n\ng, 5e-g, Tab. 3). The molecular analyses give evidence that AOM is mediated by a microbial 10 \n\ncommunity consisting of methanotrophic archaea and SRB phylogenetically related to those \n\nwhich were previously found at other methane seeps (Boetius et al., 2000; Michaelis et al., \n\n2002; Orphan et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2002). Furthermore, the presence of a similar suite of \n\n13C-depleted lipids in abundant authigenic carbonates recovered from Hesperides and Faro \n\nMV (Tab.3) indicates higher activities and a more wide spread methane turnover in the past.  15 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.1. Methanotrophic Archaea \n\n \nPrevious publications revealed dominant amounts sn2-hydroxarchaeol relative to archaeol in 20 \n\nANME-2 dominated habitats, whereas the reverse was observed in ANME-1 dominated \n\nsystems (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Teske et al., \n\n2002). Moreover, ANME-2 communities were found to comprise high contents of crocetane \n\nwhich is only present at low concentrations in ANME-1 (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Boetius et \n\nal., 2000; Elvert et al., 1999). Moreover, stable carbon isotope fractionations were found to be 25 \n\nhigher in ANME-2 compared to ANME-1 dominated habitats with ??13C-values (archaeol \n\n\n\n \n\n 33\n\nrelative to source methane) ranging between 34 to 53\u2030 and 11 to 37\u2030, respectively \n\n(Blumenberg et al., 2004; Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Hinrichs et al., 1999; \n\nOrphan et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2002).  \n\nThe high ratio of sn2-archaeol relative to archaeol and a ??13C-value of 42\u2030 of archaeol \n\ncompared to source methane (-48\u2030, Nuzzo et al., 2005) at Capt. Arutyunov MV is in good 5 \n\nagreement with the published lipid signatures of ANME-2 dominated habitats. Furthermore, \n\nthe dominant abundance of ANME-2 compared to ANME-1 clone sequences, together with \n\nthe lipid biomarker fingerprint suggest a dominance of ANME-2 in sediments of Capt. \n\nArutyunov MV.  \n\nThe comparably high ratio of archaeol relative to sn2-hydroxyarchaeol as well as a ??13C-10 \n\nvalue of -31.5\u2030 of archaeol compared to source methane at Bonjardim MV (-49.5 \u2030, Nuzzo \n\net al., 2005) lies between published values from systems dominated by ANME-1 and ANME-\n\n2. This suggests a mixed ANME community in these sediments.  \n\nThe low ratio of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol in carbonate crusts obtained from \n\nHesperides MV is in very good agreement with the published values for ANME-1 15 \n\ncommunities. Our chromatography settings for hydrocarbon separation did not resolve \n\ncrocetane from its isomer phytane, which is a known breakdown product of chlorophyll. \n\nHowever, the comparably heavy ?13C-value of this compound mixture provides evidence for a \n\nlow crocetane content, which furthermore agrees with a dominant ANME-1 origin of archaeal \n\nlipid biomass in these carbonates. Similar to Bonjardim MV, the lipid imprint in carbonate 20 \n\ncrusts recovered from Faro MV shows characteristics of both, ANME-1 and ANME-2 \n\nsystems. Comparably low amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol would be \n\nindicative for ANME-1. However, high amounts of crocetane also point to a substantial \n\ncontribution of ANME-2 to the archaeal biomass preserved in the crusts.  \n\n 25 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 34\n\n4.4.2. Sulphate Reducing Bacteria \n\n \n\nAt many different cold seep settings, ANME-1 and ANME-2 archaea have been found in \n\nconsortium with SRB of the Seep-SRB1 cluster belonging to the \n\nDesulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group (Seep-SRB1, Knittel et al., 2003). However, this cluster 5 \n\napparently comprises physiologically different ecotypes that are distinguished by very \n\nspecific FA patterns according to their association to either ANME-1 or to ANME-2 \n\n(Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2003; Knittel et al., 2003). FA signatures in \n\nenvironmental systems dominated by ANME-1 / Seep-SRB1 communities comprise high \n\ncontents of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0, whereas systems dominated by ANME-2 / Seep-SRB1 10 \n\ncommunities comprise the unusual FA cyC17:1?5,6 and dominant contents of C16:1?5 but almost \n\nbalanced ratios of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0 (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2003).  \n\nThe dominance of the unusual FAs C16:1?5 and cyC17:1?5,6 and an almost equal ratio of the iso \n\nand anteiso branched C15:0 FAs at Capt. Arutyunov MV are in very good agreement with the \n\npublished lipid signatures of the Seep SRB 1 ecotype associated with ANME-2. This finding 15 \n\nis in agreement with the predominance of Seep-SRB1 sequences in the bacterial clone library.  \n\nAs expected from the detection of potentially diverse ANME communities at Bonjardim MV, \n\nthe FA signature shows characteristics of various SRB previously identified as bacterial \n\npartners in AOM. The high ratio of ai-C15:0 compared to i-C15:0 would be indicative for the \n\nSeep-SRB1 ecotype associated with ANME-1 while the high abundance of C16:1?5 would 20 \n\nindicate the ecotype associated with ANME-2. However, a further assignment of FAs to \n\nparticular SRBs remains speculative as the FA cyC17:0w5,6 specific for the Seep-SRB1 type \n\nassociated with ANME-2 was not detected, which might be a result of the overall low \n\nconcentrations of lipids in sediments at Bonjardim MV (Fig. 5e, f, Tab. 3). At Bonjardim MV, \n\nseveral FAs carry ?13C-signatures that are comparable to the source methane and do not show 25 \n\nany fractionation. This indicates a contribution to carbon biomass from processes other than \n\n\n\n \n\n 35\n\nmethane consumption, possibly related to the anaerobic oxidation of higher hydrocarbons. A \n\nsimilar mixture of carbon sources could also explain the unspecific signature of FAs in \n\ncarbonates of Hesperides MV. Similar to Bonjardim MV, FA signatures of Seep-SRB1 cluster \n\nassociated with ANME-1 and ANME-2 were found in carbonates recovered from Faro MV. \n\nThe comparably high content of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0 and the lack of cyC17:0?5,6 is 5 \n\nindicative for Seep-SRB1 associated to ANME-1 while relatively high amounts of C16:1?5 are \n\nindicative for Seep-SRB1 associated to ANME-2. In contrast to Hesperides MV, the low \n\n?13C-values of all lipid components analysed at Faro MV give evidence that AOM dominated \n\nbiomass production. \n\nAnother striking difference is the comparably high lipid concentration in carbonates recovered 10 \n\nfrom Faro compared to those recovered from Hesperides MV. A rather recent formation of the \n\nsampled carbonates from Faro MV appears likely, as these were stained black from sulphide \n\nand recovered together with some living specimens of the chemosynthetic bivalve Acharax \n\nsp. A possible explanation for the difference in AOM-derived lipid content could be that the \n\nsampled carbonate crusts from Hesperides are older than those recovered from Faro MV and 15 \n\nhave  been exposed to oxic sea water and lipid diagenesis for a longer time. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\n 20 \n\nAt the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and \n\nFaro as well as at the \u201cNo Name\u201d structure, several indications for a slow fluid and gas   \n\ntransport were found. Our data suggest a complete consumption of methane and higher \n\nhydrocarbons in the sediments of the studied mud volcanoes at depths of 30-300 cm below \n\nseafloor. We found no indication of hydrocarbons reaching the hydrosphere, except from the 25 \n\nvisual observation of small patches of reduced sediments covered by giant sulphide-oxidizing \n\n\n\n \n\n 36\n\nbacteria. The overlap of methane and sulphate depletion with sulphide production shows that \n\nmethane and higher hydrocarbon oxidation processes are mediated microbially under \n\nanaerobic conditions. Correspondingly, anaerobic oxidation of methane and sulphate \n\nreduction rates show a peak in a distinct, narrow methane-sulphate transition zone in the \n\nsubsurface sediments of the mud volcano centres. Highest turnover rates and fluxes coincided 5 \n\nwith the shallowest SMT depths with Capt. Arutyunov MV as the most active system in the \n\nstudy area, followed by the mud volcanoes Bonjardim, Ginsburg, and Gemini and finally the \n\n\u201cNo Name\u201d structure. In comparison to other gas seeps, methane fluxes and turnover rates are \n\nlow to mid range in the Gulf of Cadiz. In addition to AOM, a substantial fraction of the SR is \n\nfuelled by the anaerobic oxidation of higher hydrocarbons, which rise from deep reservoirs 10 \n\ntogether with methane. Lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA clone library from the sediments and \n\ncarbonates of the AOM hotspots provide evidence that both of the previously described \n\nANME-1 / Seep-SRB1 and ANME-2 / Seep-SRB1 communities mediate AOM at mud \n\nvolcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. The finding of their signatures in carbonate crusts at the \n\ncentres of the investigated mud volcanoes indicates that at least some of the vast amounts of 15 \n\ncarbonates littering mud volcanoes and diapiers in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz are \n\nlinked to methane seepage. \n\n \n\n \n\n 20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 25 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 37\n\nAcknowledgements - The authors thank the captain and crew as well as the shipboard \n\nscientific community of the R/V SONNE for their help at sea.
