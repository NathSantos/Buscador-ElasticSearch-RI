Proof of porosity of the unlined aluminum surface and lined with\nepoxy resin, and the resistance to removal of the resin were observed using a scanning electron microscope\nand a stereoscope, with a digitalized image system. To evaluate the microorganisms adherence to the\naluminum surface, unlined and lined with epoxy resin, sterilized disks (10mm in diameter) were immersed in\nMueller Hinton Broth and placed in tubes of polypropylene with screw caps. The liquid culture medium\nwas then inoculated with suspensions (109CFU/ml) of the following microorganisms: Streptococcus\nagalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Candida albicans and incubated at 37\u00b0C\nunder constant agitation (100rpm) for 12 days. The culture broth was changed every 3 days, after which the\ndisks were removed, and observed under the scanning electron microscope.

Guy de Chaulic\nfirst noted the effects of foreign bodies on the subsequent\nhealing of wounds in the 14th century A. D.. The first detailed\ndescription of microbial adherence on surfaces was made by\nZobell (19) and in 1970 the word biofilm was introduced into the\nscientific literature (9). Biofilms are defined as an accumulation\nof cells immobilized on a substratum in a matrix of extracellular\npolysaccharides of microbial origin (5).\n\nThe effects of microorganisms on surfaces is now almost\nuniversally accepted. There are many different types of surfaces\npreferred by microbes (9). The presence of biofilm on a surface\ncan have many different types of effects, i.e. in the field of\n\n* Corresponding author.

(18) concluded that no surface could be\nconsidered microbiologically clean. Microorganisms are present\nin water even in low numbers and can use a solid interface as a\nsubstratum for colonization. Lucas et al. (12) warned against the\nuse of aluminum tubes as containers for medicines because of\npossible alterations, and Martindale (13) observed that on the\naluminum lid used in containers for liquid medicines with sugar, a\nblack polysaccharide formed. In 1988 Pozetti (16) observed that\nmedicines in the form of gel could suffer alterations when\npackaged in aluminum tubes lined with epoxy resin.\n\n\n\nMicroscopic examination of aluminum tubes\n\n341\n\nAccording to the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance (1)\nin RDC n\u00b0 33/2000, under the item \u201cLabelling and Packaging\u201d,\nrecipients for hand made medicines should guaranty physical\nand chemical properties, and microbiological stability. Tubes\nused in pharmaceutical packaging are usually made of 99.5%\ncommercialy pure aluminum plus secondary substances such\nas ferric oxide, silicium, and titanium (16). The aluminum forms a\npassive layer of oxide on the surface, and as a consequence\nimproves resistance to corrosion (7).\n\nThe aluminum used to produce tubes for pharmaceutical\npackaging have a smooth surface resulting from cold process\nlamination varying in thickness from 0.00635 to 0.200mm and\npossessing special characteristics resistant to destruction of\nthe lining, toxicity, and porosity (2).\n\nThe objective of the present study was to evaluate, using\nchemical and microbiological methods, the behavior of\ncommercially pure aluminum surfaces, both unlined and lined\nwith epoxy resin to be used in the manufacture of tubes for the\npackaging of medicines for external use in alopathic,\nhomeopathic or phitotherapic medicine.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nCommercially pure aluminum unlined\nTo evaluate the porosity of the unlined aluminum surface,\n\nrectangular pieces of different sizes, were cut from unlined\naluminum tubes before being filled with medicines, and then\nsubmitted to the action of a 5% (p/v) solution of mercury\nchloride for 5 minutes, according to CBE-Bandeirante de\nEmbalagens Ltda (4).\n\nCommercially pure aluminum lined with epoxy resin\nTo test the porosity of the epoxy resin lining the aluminum\n\nsurface and the resistance to removal of the lining, rectangles\nof different sizes were cut from aluminum tubes lined with epoxy\nresin ready to receive the medicines. The samples were submitted\nto the action of a solution of 20% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide\nfor 3 hours, followed by friction with cotton swabs for lining\nremoval, according to instructions of CBE-Bandeirante de\nEmbalagens Ltda (4).\n\nMicrobiological Evaluation\nFor microbiological evalutions of the unlined and lined\n\naluminum surface with epoxy resin, disks of 10mm in diameter,\nwere cut from the same tubes above mentioned.\n\nThe microorganisms Streptococcus agalactiae ,\nStaphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter lwoffii were\ncultivated in Blood Agar and Candida albicans were cultivated\nin Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, all mediums used were from Difco\n(10). These microorganisms were chosen because they are\nisolated with facility from biological and industrial environments.\nSuspensions were made in a Brain Heart Infusion and incubated\n\nat 37\u00b0C until an optical density of 1.0 (540nm) was reached;\n200\u00b5l of each cellular suspension (109UFC/ml) was used to\ninoculate 15ml of Mueller Hinton Broth. The metallic samples\nwere autoclaved at 121\u00b0C for 15 min. and placed in 50ml\npolypropylene tubes [Corning] (8), containing 15ml of inoculated\nMueller Hinton Broth, and incubated at 37\u00b0C under constant\nagitation of 100 revolutions per minute. The culture medium\nwas changed every 3 days at 12 day intervals. After which the\nsamples were removed from the liquid culture medium, prepared\nand examined using the scanning electron microscope (15).\n\nElectron Microscope Procedures\nThe samples were immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M\n\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.1) to fix the microorganisms, dehydrated\nin aqueous solutions of ethanol (15, 30, 50, 70, 95 and 100%) for\n15 min. each one, and dried in a centrifuge under vacuum, then\ncoated with gold and examined under the scanning electron\nmicroscope JEOL-JSM [T330A] (15).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nSamples of aluminum unlined and lined with epoxy resin,\nobtained from tubes used for packaging medicines, were\nsubmitted to chemical evaluation with regard to the porosity.\nThe surface observed macroscopically showed the formation\nof an amalgam of aluminum on the epoxy resin lined surface,\nafter treatment with 5% HgCl2. A chemical reaction was\nobserved because the surface lined with epoxy resin was shown\nto be porous. The mercury chloride had reacted with the\naluminum producing an alloy of mercury and aluminum easily\nobserved. As a control aluminum samples without lining were\nused. According to the literature, porosity can be an undesirable\nfactor, as the pores lead to stress and diminish mechanical\nresistence (14).\n\nRegarding the proof of resistance to removal of the lining, a\nparcial removal of the resin was observed after an aluminum\nsurface treatment with 20% ammonium hydroxide and friction\nwith cotton swabs. This proof is used in order to verify the\nresin adherence on the aluminum surface.\n\nIn the present study, the physical surface of aluminum lined\nwith epoxy resin was observed using the Leica (MZ12)\nstereoscope microscope showing an invasion of the external\nlining as well as flaws in the internal lining. Sharp points of\naluminum and flaws in application of the resin were also noted,\naccording to Pozetti (17).\n\nThe tubes of aluminum used in pharmaceutical packaging\ncan at times show defects such as: internal or external dirt, foreign\nbodies, or deformed tubes, extremities of tubes either deformed\nor torn; breaks in the body of the tube when pressed, and other\ndefects in production. On the internal lining following alterations\ncan occur: high porosity, low adherence or elasticity of the resin,\nhigh solubility in acetone; low resistance to ammonia and acetic\n\n\n\n342\n\nE.L. Pizzolito et al.\n\nacid; the resin can also be rough, and non uniform. The interior\nresin could be contaminated by the exterior coating, and thus\ntransfer particles of grease or oil into the product, according to\nCBE- Bandeirante de Embalagens Ltda. (4).\n\nBacterial adherence and biofilm formation on a commercially\npure aluminum surface, lined with epoxy resin, was observed\nafter samples incubation in Mueller Hinton Broth inoculated\nwith Streptococcus agalactiae (Fig. 1), Candida albicans (Fig.\n2), Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 3), and on an unlined surface,\nAcinetobacter lwoffii (Fig.4), Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 5)\nand Candida albicans (Fig. 6).\n\nThe microbiological evaluations observed using scanning\nelectron microscope showed that the surface lined with epoxy\nresin, attracted a microbial colonization (Figs 1-3) and also,\naccording to Montanaro, Arciola (14), and Pizzolitto et al. (15),\nthe microorganisms seemed to have a preference for irregular or\nporous surfaces. These types of surfaces furnish niches in\nwhich the microorganisms can attract, stick to, and grow in\nmicrocolonies forming biofilms. It was also observed there was\na microbial adherence on unlined aluminum surfaces (Figs. 4-6).\nOur results coincide with those of other researcher (12) who\ndisapprove the use of aluminum tubes even those which are\nlined, due the fact that the contents prepared using plants such\nas hamamelis, aromatic chamomile, eucalyptus, etc., are\nincompatible with metallic salts, including those of aluminum.\nAluminum can also form inumerous complexes of all the groups,\nboth soluble and insoluble. Aluminum can precipitate Ag, Cu,\nHg, Sn, Sb, Cd, etc., by reduction (6). According to Lucas (12)\naluminum is incompatible with mercury salts, and in general\n\nwith alkalis, alkaline carbonates, acid and acids salts in general.\nIn reference to tubes manufactured using aluminum lined with\nepoxy resin Clark et al. (7) observed that this resin is incompatible\nwith vegetable oils, gums, resins, and cellulosic polymer. Pozetti\n(17) recommended that the metallic tubes should not be used as\nrecipients for products used in oral hygiene, homeopathic,\n\nFigure 1.

According to Ferreira\n(11) pharmaceutical packaging should be clean, and non interact\nphysically or chemically with the contents. The quality and\npurity of the preparation, must be preserved and should be\npaint resistant, protecting the contents from the action of light,\nas well as being tightly closed to avoid external contamination.\n\nOur results showed that aluminum both unlined and lined with\nepoxy resin used for packaging pharmaceutical products permit\nmicrobial adherence.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported in part by N\u00facleo de Atendimento\n\u00e0 Comunidade-NAC - Unidade Auxiliar Integrada \u00e0 Faculdade\nde Ci\u00eancias Farmac\u00eauticas, c\u00e2mpus de Araraquara-UNESP\n(Brazil) and in part by the Instituto de Qu\u00edmica, c\u00e2mpus de\nAraraquara-UNESP (Brazil).\n\nRESUMO\n\nAvalia\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica e microbiol\u00f3gica da superf\u00edcie\ninterna dos tubos de alum\u00ednio n\u00e3o revestido e\n\nrevestido com resina ep\u00f3xi por meio de microsc\u00f3pio\nestereosc\u00f3pio e eletr\u00f4nico de varredura\n\nA superf\u00edcie interna das bisnagas fabricadas com alum\u00ednio\nn\u00e3o revestido e revestido com resina ep\u00f3xi, utilizadas para\nacondicionar cremes, pomadas, g\u00e9is, etc., foram avaliadas\nquimicamente e por m\u00e9todos microbiol\u00f3gicos correlacionados\ncom a ader\u00eancia de microrganismos.
