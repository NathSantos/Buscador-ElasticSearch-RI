No ambiente marinho, a maioria dos organismos bent\u00f3nicos \nt\u00eam ciclos de vida complexos, envolvendo larvas pel\u00e1gicas que s\u00e3o \ntransportadas por correntes oce\u00e2nicas contribuindo para dispers\u00e3o das \nesp\u00e9cies. A dispers\u00e3o larvar estabelece conectividade entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es \ngeograficamente separadas e afeta a estrutura da popula\u00e7\u00e3o. O conhecimento \ndeste processo biol\u00f3gico promove informa\u00e7\u00f5es importantes para a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o \nde popula\u00e7\u00f5es marinhas. Este estudo investiga a estrutura gen\u00e9tica e \nconectividade de popula\u00e7\u00f5es de mexilh\u00e3o de profundidade entre habitats \nfragmentados no NE Atl\u00e2ntico e Mediterr\u00e2nico. O gene mitocondrial, Citocromo \nOxidase I (mtCOI), foi utilizado para analisar diversidade gen\u00e9tica por local e a \nestrutura populacional de duas esp\u00e9cies de mexilh\u00e3o, Idas modiolaeformis e \n\"Idas\" simpsoni. As popula\u00e7\u00f5es de cada uma das esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o se encontram \ngeograficamente isoladas. A presen\u00e7a de um hapl\u00f3tipo dominante para cada \nesp\u00e9cie sugere a partilha de polimorfismos ancestrais entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es do \nMediterr\u00e2neo e do NE Atl\u00e2ntico. As popula\u00e7\u00f5es de I. modiolaeformis \ndemonstraram uma elevada diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica, indicando estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o da \nmetapopula\u00e7\u00e3o. Popula\u00e7\u00f5es distantes umas das outras, localizadas no Atl\u00e2ntico \ne E Mediterr\u00e2neo, revelaram baixas dist\u00e2ncias gen\u00e9ticas, sugerindo fluxo \ngen\u00e9tico entre as duas regi\u00f5es. Dist\u00e2ncias gen\u00e9ticas e geogr\u00e1ficas suportam o \nmodelo de ilha como o modelo para a estrutura populacional de I. \nmodiolaeformis. Uma grande desvantagem deste estudo est\u00e1 relacionada com \no n\u00famero discrepante de indiv\u00edduos entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es. Para investigar os \npadr\u00f5es de conectividade em diferentes escalas espaciais ser\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios \nmais estudos, utilizando mais esp\u00e9cimes e outros marcadores gen\u00e9ticos. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nBathymodiolinae, organic falls, larval dispersal, mtCOI, haplotype network \n\nabstract \n\n \nSpecies persist over time, due to exchange of individuals between \nsubpopulations. In the marine environment, most benthic organisms have \ncomplex life cycles including pelagic larvae that are transported by ocean \ncurrents promoting species dispersal. Larval dispersal connects geographically \ndistant populations and determines population structure. The knowledge about \nthis biologic process provides relevant information for conservation of marine \npopulations. This study investigates the genetic structure and connectivity of \ndeep-sea mussel populations between fragmented habitats in the NE Atlantic \nand Mediterranean. The mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (mtCOI) gene was \nused to analyze site-specific genetic diversity and the population structure of two \nmussel species, Idas modiolaeformis and \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni. Populations of each \nspecies are not geographically isolated. The presence of one dominant \nhaplotype for each species suggests shared ancestral polymorphisms between \nMediterranean and NE Atlantic populations. The overall high genetic \ndifferentiation observed in I. modiolaeformis indicates that the metapopulation is \nstructured. Distant populations, located in Atlantic and E Mediterranean, \nrevealed low genetic distances, suggesting gene flow between the two regions. \nGenetic and geographical distances support an island model of I. modiolaeformis \npopulation structure. A major drawback of this study is concerned with the \ndiscrepant number of individuals among populations. Further research will be \nneeded, using more specimens and other gene markers, to investigate \nconnectivity patterns at different spatial scales. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cOs mexilh\u00f5es xom xom xom xom xom xom xom os mesmos\u201d \nAutor desconhecido \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nI \n\nCONTENTS \n\n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES ...........................................................................................................III \n\nLIST OF TABLES .............................................................................................................

The goal of this discipline is to understand, protect and perpetuate biological \n\ndiversity among all scales and levels of biological organization, so present and future \n\ngenerations can sustainably explore and use them. Nowadays, conservation brings \n\ntogether ecological, environmental, social, economic and political fields, among other \n\ndisciplines (Meine, 2010). Prevention measures require the study of species distribution, \n\nabundance and ecological functions, and evaluation of risks and threats for species \n\nconservation (reviewed in Goodsell and Underwood, 2009).  \n\nRegarding the marine environment, conservation of species or habitats is achieved \n\nthrough establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) and legislation (restriction, \n\nregulation or prohibition of habitats destruction or modification). MPAs range from totally \n\nclosed to any anthropogenic activity, to limited catches or temporary closures to human \n\nactions. The implementation of marine reserves restores biodiversity of endangered species \n\nor important habitats and increases fisheries, creating long-term economic benefits. \n\nHowever, in a short term, measures of conservation generate conflict with economic \n\ninterests. Thus, design and management of MPAs should integrate not only ecological \n\nconcerns, but also economic, political and social issues (reviewed in Goodsell and \n\nUnderwood, 2009). \n\nCorridors between reserves were proved to be extremely important, once they allow \n\nexchange of individuals/genes preventing extinction of populations due to inbreeding \n\ndepression. For many marine populations, ocean currents serve as corridors for organisms \n\ndispersal (reviewed in Goodsell and Underwood, 2009). Genetic connectivity between \n\nMPAs is an important factor to the maintenance of MPA networks (Bell, 2008). For this \n\nreason, knowledge about hydrodynamics, dispersal and connectivity between populations \n\nis important to the management of MPAs. \n\nDispersal, settlement and recruitment are biological processes extremely important to \n\nthe ecology (geographical distribution, abundance) and evolution of marine populations \n\n(reviewed in Jenkins et al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2009). Larval dispersal is inferred from \n\ngene flow between populations and population structure. Recently, molecular genetic \n\nmarkers (indirect approaches) have been used to estimate gene/larval exchange between \n\npopulations (Marshall et al., 2009). \n\nPopulation structure and connectivity research provides important data, for example \n\ninferences about source-sink dynamics, habitat\u2019s ability for recolonization, among other \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n2 \n\nrelevant information (Boschen et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2009), which is crucial to \n\nconservation of marine populations (Thaler et al., 2014; Marshall et al., 2009).  \n\nThis dissertation intends to increase the knowledge about population structure and \n\nconnectivity that will be useful to advice on legislation and management strategies for \n\nmarine habitats. In this study, I used a genetic approach to investigate the population \n\nstructure of two deep-sea chemosymbiotic mussels (Idas spp.), providing new insights into \n\npopulation connectivity among fragmented habitats in the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean \n\narea. Following is a description of the chapters\u2019 content: \n\n \n\nChapter 1 reviews concepts of population structure and connectivity, which in organisms \n\nwith a larval stage is maintained by larval supply into the environment, larval dispersal to \n\nother populations, and also settlement and recruitment in new habitats. This study \n\naddresses deep-sea populations, thus deep-water ecosystems were briefly characterized, \n\nwith a particular focus on reduced habitats, inhabited by chemosymbiotic mussels, followed \n\nby an overview of the main threats to these habitats and examples of deep-ocean MPAs. \n\nFinally, knowledge about deep-sea mussels was reviewed, specifically the Bathymodiolinae \n\nsubfamily, indicating reproductive adaptations to reduced habitats.  \n\nChapter 2 presents the framework of this project, including recent studies on population \n\ngenetic structure and connectivity, and a brief mention to the CHEMECO project that \n\nprovided samples for this study. The objectives of this work are defined. \n\nChapter 3 describes the geology and hydrodynamics of the study region and \n\ncharacterizes the habitats where species were found. Methods used in sampling collection, \n\nDNA sequencing and data analyses are described. The dataset (including available \n\nGenBank sequences) used in this investigation is provided. \n\nChapter 4 presents the results, namely the success rate of DNA extractions, \n\namplifications, and sequencing, followed by the phylogenetic reconstruction and population \n\nstructure analyses, including haplotype network, AMOVA, SAMOVA, pairwise genetic \n\ndistances, and lastly, correlation analysis between geographic and genetic distances. \n\nChapter 5 discusses the data obtained in this study in comparison with other studies, \n\nand its interpretation. \n\nChapter 6 refers the main conclusions and limitations of this study, and some \n\nimprovements are suggested for future research, as well as further methods for \n\ninvestigating population structure and connectivity in the deep sea. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n3 \n\nChapter 1. LITERATURE REVIEW  \n\n \n\n1.1. Population structure and connectivity \n\n \n\nThe exchange of individuals between populations is crucial for the persistence of \n\npopulations. Over time, a population prevails when the number of births and immigration \n\nare superior or equal to the number of deaths and emigration (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; \n\nLowe and Allendorf, 2010). If the population does not have migrants neither entering nor \n\nleaving the population, yet births are superior to deaths, this population is considered as \n\nclosed. In this case, problems deriving from inbreeding may occur, such as infertility or loss \n\nof viability, due to matting between genetically closely-related individuals (Allendorf and \n\nLuikart, 2007; Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; Gillespie, 1998). If the population exchanges \n\n(receive and export) individuals with other populations, it is considered as an open \n\npopulation. The random exchange between open populations is known as panmixia (Cowen \n\nand Sponaugle, 2009; Hellberg et al., 2002). \n\nMost natural populations cannot behave as a single randomly mating population, \n\nbecause species can occupy vast geographical areas or have barriers to migration \n\n(Gillespie, 1998). Natural populations are generally subdivided or structured in smaller units, \n\nwhere local random matting may occur (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007). The largest population \n\ncan be referred as metapopulation and the units can be named populations or \n\nsubpopulations. Hence, metapopulation is defined as an \u201cassemblage of discrete local \n\npopulations with some measure of shared migration among them\u201d (Cowen and Sponaugle, \n\n2009; pg 444). \n\nThe metapopulation structure is expected to reflect genetic variation within and between \n\nlocal populations (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007). The study of population genetic structure \n\ninvestigates which evolutionary forces (migration, genetic drift or natural selection) are \n\nresponsible for the genetic variation across a geographic area (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; \n\nGillespie, 1998). According to the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the transmission of genetic \n\ninformation over generations occurs without mutation (locus equilibrium) in a randomly \n\nmating population without evolutionary forcing, such as genetic drift, natural selection and \n\nmigration. Thus, genetic differentiation between populations indicates deviations to the \n\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Gillespie, 1998).  \n\nEmpirical models of metapopulation structure vary according to population size and \n\nisolation (Aycrigg and Garton, 2014). Considering the complete isolation of the populations, \n\none can make two assumptions: random mating and genetic drift in each isolated \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n4 \n\nsubpopulation. Over time, each subpopulation will fix one or more alleles. However, \n\nmigration usually occurs which implies gene flow among populations. The most simplified \n\ncase is to consider two equal sized populations with bidirectional exchange of individuals. \n\nWe can consider gene flow with or without genetic drift. When isolated populations are \n\nsubject to gene flow and genetic drift, populations will be genetically distinct (Allendorf and \n\nLuikart, 2007). \n\nGene flow tends to genetically homogenize the individuals of geographically separated \n\npopulations but, on the other hand, genetic drift and natural selection cause divergence \n\nwithin a metapopulation. Neutral evolution attributes the genetic variation within a \n\npopulation to migration and genetic drift, excluding natural selection. Therefore, neutral \n\ngene divergence between populations will be a balance of gene flow (due to dispersal) and \n\ngenetic drift (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; Hartl and Clark, 1997). \n\nBased on different patterns of gene flow, several models are used to describe the \n\nstructuring of populations (Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Models of population structure (1-4) and expected correlations between genetic and \ngeographic distances (a, b). Island model with two versions 1) the classical and 2) the mainland-\nisland; 3) stepping-stone model and 4) isolation-by-distance model. Circles represent populations \nand arrows represent gene flow. Expected correlations between genetic divergence and geographic \ndistances are exhibited for: (a) island model and (b) stepping-stone and isolation-by-distance models. \nImages adapted from Allendorf and Luikart (2007) and Altukhov (2006). \n\n \n\n The island model has two versions. In the first version, populations have equal size and \n\nequal rate of gene exchange (classical). All populations contribute to a common gene pool \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n5 \n\nwhere mating occurs randomly. In the second version (mainland-island), one largest \n\npanmictic population exists as well as few smaller populations (islands) that receive genes \n\nfrom the mainland. Isolation-by-distance model suggests that genetic distances depend on \n\nthe distance between neighboring populations and on the size of the population (Altukhov, \n\n2006). The stepping-stone model represents one intermediate situation between the island \n\nmodel and the isolation-by-distance model. The stepping-stone structure assumes that the \n\nexchange of genes only occurs between the neighbor populations, considering equal size \n\nof populations and equal migration rates (Altukhov, 2006).  \n\nThe interchange among geographically distant (sub)populations contributes to \n\nmetapopulation connectivity (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). In this way, studies about \n\npopulation structure allow inferences about connectivity. Population connectivity can be \n\nviewed from two perspectives: demographic connectivity and genetic connectivity. \n\nDemographic connectivity can be defined as the degree to which population growth and \n\nvital rates (birth and survival) are affected by dispersal (immigration or emigration rates) \n\n(Lowe and Allendorf, 2010). Genetic connectivity depends on the absolute number of \n\ndispersers (emigration) among populations and can be defined as the \u201cdegree to which \n\ngene flow affects evolutionary processes within subpopulations\u201d (Lowe and Allendorf, \n\n2010). Genetic methods are most useful to infer genetic connectivity, but provide little \n\ninformation on demographic connectivity. \n\nMost marine benthic species have complex life cycles including sessile/sedentary adults \n\nand a pelagic larval phase that is the main responsible for species dispersal (Thorson, \n\n1950). Marine population connectivity includes the dispersal phase from reproduction to \n\nhabitat selection, metamorphosis and complete settlement processes (Figure 2) (reviewed \n\nin Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009).  \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n6 \n\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 Connectivity contributing processes: larval supply and dispersal, settlement and \nrecruitment. Dimension of funnel indicates larval abundance that decreases from reproduction to \nrecruitment as a result of physical and biological factors. Adapted from Cowen and Sponaugle (2009) \nand Pineda (2000).  \n \n\n1.1.1. Larval supply and dispersal  \n\n \n\nThe exchange of individuals, and therefore genes, is related with the rates of dispersal \n\nbetween populations (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007). Supply of larvae is highly variable, \n\ninfluencing strongly both ecology and evolution of marine taxa (reviewed in Marshall et al., \n\n2009). Self-recruitment (reproduction inside a subpopulation) also occurs, mainly in species \n\nfrom patchy habitats, due to the low probability of finding suitable habitats to settle (Cowen \n\nand Sponaugle, 2009; Swearer et al., 2002). \n\nThe production of larvae depends on fecundity (ability of gametes production) and \n\nfertilization success (zygotes production). Fecundity is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic \n\nfactors. On one hand, nutritional history, maternal size and age are intrinsic factors that \n\nrestrict gametes production. On the other hand, environmental stress, intra- and inter-\n\ncompetition can represent some extrinsic factors that regulate fecundity (Ramirez-Llodra, \n\n2002). Variation of fecundity results from egg quantity and quality, for instance, the eggs\u2019 \n\ndimensions, which affect fertilization success (larger female gametes have better chances \n\nof being fertilized) (Gaudron et al., 2012). \n\n In the majority of marine animals fertilization is external, meaning that larval production \n\nis not reflected by fecundity (Gaudron et al., 2012). Fertilization success has great \n\nfluctuations, rarely reaching 100%. The probability of female and male gamete encounters, \n\ngametes quality, local hydrodynamics, density population and intra-specific competition are \n\nsome factors that affect fertilization success (reviewed in Marshall et al., 2009). \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n7 \n\nDispersal processes depend on physical and biological factors. Physical factors consist \n\nof currents and turbulence that mix larvae, allowing the expansion or limiting their spatial \n\ndistribution. Biological factors include larval behaviour (vertical migration, swimming) and \n\npredator/prey interactions (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; Marshall et al., 2009). Some \n\nenvironmental features may influence larval behaviour (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). \n\nSameoto and Metaxas (2008) showed that larval physiological tolerance to temperature \n\nand salinity influence vertical distribution, affecting adult population distributions, genetic \n\nflow and dispersal movements. \n\nMortality of dispersing larvae results from physical, environmental and biological factors, \n\nfor example ocean currents, pollution, salinity changes, availability of suitable settlement \n\nhabitat, predation and post-settlement survivorship. The mortality during the planktonic \n\nperiod affects the dispersal distance and the quantity of recruited larvae into a population \n\n(Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; Marshall et al., 2009). \n\nPelagic Larval Duration (PLD) is the time that larvae spend dispersing in water column \n\n(Shanks et al., 2003). Species phylogeny and environmental features determine PLD. Thus, \n\nPLD can be season-, species- and location-specific (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; Hil\u00e1rio \n\net al., 2015). Hil\u00e1rio and other authors (2015) reviewed the knowledge about PLD, \n\nconcluding that PLD vary with bathymetric range of benthic organisms. Shallow organisms \n\n(depth<200 m) have a shorter and less variable PLD (25-30.35 days), whereas deep-sea \n\norganisms (depth>200 m) have a larger and more variable PLD (73.40-96.63 days). This \n\nmeasure may be used to estimate dispersal distances, when it is coupled with advection \n\nvelocity. Dispersal distances estimated for several taxa range from a few meters to 1000 \n\nkilometres (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). However, this approach is limited, since \n\ndispersal processes relate not only with the larvae pelagic time, but also involve larval \n\nbehaviour and hydrodynamic processes. Therefore, the use of biophysical models, \n\nincorporating physical features (temperature, salinity, velocity of oceanic currents, etc) with \n\nbiological features (larva\u2019s feeding regime, larval behaviour, PLD, etc), are crucial to \n\nestimate dispersal distance (reviewed in Hil\u00e1rio et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n1.1.2. Settlement and recruitment  \n\n \n\nThe free-swimming larval stage (dispersal) culminates on the settlement of competent \n\nindividuals (reviewed in Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). Settlement processes involve the \n\ncontact of larvae with substrate, the exploration and inspection, and also the acceptance or \n\nrejection of the site. Thus, settlement usually represents the end of the pelagic period and \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n8 \n\nthe initiation of the sedentary life. Larval behaviour, regulated by physical and biological \n\ncues, allows larvae to choose between accepting and rejecting the settlement site. When \n\nlarvae reject the settlement site, they are released from the substrate returning to the water \n\ncolumn. When larvae accept the site, settlers attach to the substrate and then \n\nmetamorphosis occurs. To ensure that settlement occurs in an appropriate environment \n\n(that allow larval survival, growth and reproduction) larvae respond to a set of cues that \n\nstimulates settlement behaviour. Some examples of biological cues are food supply, \n\nmicrobial film and presence of conspecifics (potential mates), competitors and predators. \n\nPhysical cues include availability of space, rock type and mineral composition, micro-\n\ntopography, temperature, salinity, hydrostatic flow and pressure, among others. Settlement \n\nprocesses lead to a high mortality rate, since the larvae suffer considerable morphological \n\nchanges at the metamorphosis (reviewed in Jenkins et al., 2009).  \n\nThe term recruitment lies ill-defined, however it is considered a combination of settlement \n\nand post-settlement period, when growth and reproduction occur. Recruitment pattern can \n\nbe influenced by density-dependent interactions or by the nutritional requirements at the \n\nbenthic stage. Recruitment shows spatial and temporal variability due to environmental \n\nconditions and intraspecific competition (for food and space) (reviewed in Jenkins et al., \n\n2009). \n\n \n\n1.2. Deep-sea ecosystems \n\n \n\nOceans cover approximately 70% of the earth\u2019s surface and a large portion (~ 50%) is \nbelow 3000 m depth (Tyler, 2003). The deep sea is defined from the beginning of the shelf \n\nbreak at approximately 200 m depth and comprises 95% of the volume of the biosphere \n\n(Danovaro et al., 2014; Thistle, 2003). Its exploration began in the late 19th century, \n\nrevealing over the past decades several new geological features (e.g. hydrothermal vents \n\nand cold seeps) and highly abundant biological communities (Tyler, 2003). \n\nThe vast deep-sea habitat is found in an environment considered relatively stable, \n\ncharacterized by high pressures, low food input and oxygen concentration, and generally \n\nlow temperatures. The temperature decreases with increasing depth, except at \n\nhydrothermal vents, where high temperatures (260-400\u00baC) can be reached (Fisher et al., \n\n2007; Thistle, 2003). On the abyssal plain the temperature reaches -2\u00baC to 2\u00baC (Thistle, \n\n2003). Erosional and depositional processes lead terrigenous, intertidal and subtidal \n\norganic material to become coastal particulate organic matter (POM). Small particles (e.g. \n\nremains of plankton, fecal pellets, etc), large animal carcasses and plant detritus sink until \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n9 \n\nreaching the deep-sea floor, turning into POM. Also, dissolved organic matter represents \n\nan organic input into the deep sea. Contrasting with usually slow near-bottom water \n\ncurrents, occasional periods of fast flow (e.g. benthic storms and dense shelf water \n\ncascades) increase the horizontal food flux and consequently benefit some species (Gage, \n\n2003).  \n\nIn addition to temperature drop, increasing depth causes an abrupt light intensity \n\ndecrease. Below ~250 m depth, light penetration can no longer support photosynthesis. An \n\nalternative process of primary production is through chemosynthesis. This is one of the \n\nparticular features that differentiates some deep sea habitats (reviewed in Thistle, 2003). \n\n \n\n1.2.1. Reducing habitats \n\n \n\nHydrothermal vents, cold seeps, whale and wood falls are chemosynthesis-based \n\necosystems with primary production being guaranteed by chemoautotrophic bacteria (Distel \n\net al., 2000; Duperron et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2007; Smith and Baco, 2003). These \n\nchemoautotrophs produce organic compounds using geochemical energy generated from \n\nthe oxidation of reduced compounds, such us sulphate and nitrate (Duperron et al., 2008; \n\nFisher et al., 2007). The chemosynthetic bacteria support the microbial ecosystem and the \n\nanimal communities establishing symbiotic associations (Fisher et al., 1994 in Fisher et al., \n\n2007; Duperron, 2010). The term symbiosis used in this context refers to the \u201cclose \n\nassociation between a metazoan host and bacteria allowing the host to gain novel metabolic \n\ncapabilities\u201d (Douglas, 1994 in Duperron, 2010; pg 138).  \n\nIn hydrothermal vents that are usually located on active tectonic plate boundaries (Figure \n\n3), the water is heated and enriched in reduced compounds such us sulphide and metals. \n\nThe interactions between the geo-thermally heated fluids and cold seawater precipitate the \n\ndissolved minerals and metals forming chimneys (Duperron, 2010). Hydrothermal vent \n\ncommunities include a great diversity of invertebrate phyla, such as Annelida, Mollusca, \n\nCrustacea, among others. Octopuses and fishes also occur near this habitat (Fisher et al., \n\n2007; Tunnicliffe et al., 1998). In contrast, cold seeps occur mostly along continental \n\nmargins (Figure 3). In cold seeps, the organic matter is reduced by thermogenesis and \n\nbiogenesis, producing hydrocarbon and methane-rich fluids that are released to the water \n\ncolumn (Duperron, 2010). At these habitats, small bivalves are abundant (particularly \n\nfamilies: Mytilidae, Vesicomyidae, Thyasiridae), and siboglinid polychaetes are also present \n\n(Cunha et al., 2013a; Hil\u00e1rio et al., 2011; Hil\u00e1rio et al., 2010; Olu-Le Roy et al., 2004; \n\nRodrigues et al., 2008).  \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n10 \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Distribution of hydrothermal vents (violet) and cold seeps (green) (Danovaro et al., 2014). \n \n\nIn addition to vent and seep habitats, organic falls are also reduced habitats. Submerged \n\nmammal skeletons, wood, kelp, seagrass and other organic deposits are ephemeral (short-\n\nlived) and fragmented (because organic flux is intermittent in space) habitats (Smith and \n\nBaco, 2003; Tunnicliffe et al., 2003). Sunken bones have sulphide-reducing bacteria that \n\nreduce lipids into hydrogen sulphide (Smith and Baco, 2003). The product of bacterial \n\ndecomposition in sunken wood is also sulphide (Distel et al., 2000). The organic \n\ndecomposition produces reduced compounds (reviewed in Tunicliffe et al., 2003), enabling \n\nchemosymbiotic and other species to settle (Smith and Baco, 2003; Tunnicliffe et al., 1998). \n\nIndeed, deep-sea organisms have a rapid and vigorous response to the sunken wood input. \n\nFor instance, wood is colonised mainly by specialized molluscs, polychaetes and \n\noccasionally vestimentiferan tube worms (Turner, 1973; Gage, 2003; Tunnicliffe et al., \n\n2003).  \n\nThe availability of habitat for settlement, such as organic falls, can reduce dispersal \n\ndistances of organisms. Owing to this fact, organic falls have an important role in deep-sea \n\necology and in biogeographic distribution of chemosymbiotic species (G\u00e9nio et al., 2014). \n\nInterestingly, some taxa may occur in vents, seeps, whales and wood falls (Tunnicliffe et \n\nal., 1998). The taxonomic overlap between these habitats suggested that organic falls can \n\nserve as \u201cdispersal stepping stones\u201d for seep and vent habitats (Smith and Baco, 2003; \n\nTunnicliffe et al., 1998). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n11 \n\n1.2.2. Threats to deep-sea habitats \n\n \n\nDeep-sea habitats as well as other marine ecosystems are threatened. Climate change, \n\npollutant contamination (Figure 4A and AB), debris, over-harvesting and habitat loss are \n\nsome examples of such threats. In some cases, the impact on the habitats are more \n\nintensive, in others are more extensive, leading to different consequences for biota \n\n(reviewed in Goodsell and Underwood, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Example of anthropogenic impacts in deep sea: litter collected from Mediterranean at \n1200 m (A) and at 3000 m in Pacific Ocean (B); oil discharge in water column in Gulf of Mexico (C) \nand deep-sea coral covered with oil in Gulf de Mexico (D). Images from Ramirez-Llodra et al. (2011). \n\n \n\nMetals and minerals are widely extracted from land and onshore reserves. However, as \n\nthese resources are being depleted, exploration is moving to deeper, offshore areas. \n\nManganese nodules, cobalt crusts and massive sulphides are important deposits of metals \n\nin the deep-sea (depths>4000 m) and have great economic relevance. Nowadays, sea-floor \n\nmining is still very expensive, but underwater mining equipment is being developed, and \n\nenvironment impact of this activity is still uncertain (Lange et al., 2014). Some ecological \n\nstudies have been conducted in order to minimize the exploration impacts (Vanreusel et al., \n\n2016). \n\nSimilar to mineral exploration, the great oil and gas consumption lead to depletion of \n\nshallow-water reserves, driving the exploration of these resources at deeper depths (Lange \n\net al., 2014). The exploration of oil and gas has enormous consequences to the marine \n\nenvironment (Figure 4C and 4D), resulting from routine activity or accidental contamination \n\nfrom extraction stations. Some of the routine activity impacts include: excess of \n\nsedimentation, chemical contamination of the water, damage of hard substratum (such as \n\ncoral reefs), as well as light and sound pollution. Accidental impacts resulting from oil and \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n12 \n\ngas release are: contamination of water, fauna mortality and disturbance of marine \n\ncommunity (reviewed in Cordes et al., 2016). \n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented to preserve biodiversity and \n\nhabitats (reviewed in Goodsell and Underwood, 2009). In the last decades, concerns about \n\ndeep-sea habitats and biodiversity are increasing, and a few MPA have already been \n\nestablished in deep water. The first deep-sea habitats protected were hydrothermal vents, \n\nthe Lucky Stricke and Menez Gwen vent fields (Azores) in 2002 and Endeavour Segment \n\n(Canada) in 2003 (Leary, 2006; Vrijenhoek, 2010). \n\nAiming to the management of the manganese nodules mining at Clarion-Clipperton Zone \n\n(Pacific Ocean), the International Seabed Authorithy (ISA) assigned in 2012 areas of \n\nparticular environmental interest (APEI\u2019s), prohibiting mineral extraction in a total area of \n\n160000 km2 (Lange et al., 2014). \n\nRecently, July of 2015, the Portuguese government declared the seamounts of the \n\nGorringe Bank as marine protected area, with depths ranging from 25 to 5000 m. The area \n\nproposed to conservation has 2 288 782.11 hectares - Resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do Conselho de Ministros \n\nn.\u00ba 59/2015 (Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica, 2015). \n\n \n\n1.3. Deep-sea mussels \u2013 close look to Bathymodiolins (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) \n \n\nOver the years, several species of mussels have been reported worldwide from 200 to \n\n3600 m depth. About 37 species have been found associated to reduced environments \n\nincluding vents, seeps and organic falls (e.g. whale carcasses or sunken wood) (Baco and \n\nSmith, 2003; Distel et al., 2000; Duperron, 2010; Smith and Baco, 2003). However, more \n\nhidden diversity have recently been found based on molecular research (Faure et al., 2015; \n\nG\u00e9nio et al., 2014; Lorion et al., 2009).  \n\nThe remarkable difference between deep-sea mussels and their coastal relatives is the \n\noccurrence of chemosynthetic bacterial endosymbionts (Duperron et al., 2008; Duperron, \n\n2010). Regarding the Mytilidae family, all subfamilies are assymbiotic except for the \n\nBathymodiolinae subfamily, containing chemosymbiotic species (Taylor and Glover, 2010). \n\nMoreover, mytilids have an important role in the deep-sea ecosystem, providing hard \n\nsubstratum (ecosystem engineers), available food sources such as feacal pellets (for \n\ndetritus feeders) and dead remains (for scavengers) (Turner, 1973). \n\nThe origin of the Bathymodiolinae subfamily was registered between the Cenozoic and \n\nthe late Mesozoic. Bathymodiolins have a pattern of evolution from shallow (<1000 m) to \n\ndeep habitats, with multiple re-radiations in deeper waters (Jones et al., 2006; Lorion et al., \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n13 \n\n2013). These authors suggested that shallow-water cold seeps, hydrothermal seamounts \n\nand hydrocarbon deposits may have served as a refuge during extinction events \n\n(anoxic/dysoxic events) in deep-sea environments. Hence, these refuges provided \n\nopportunities to new evolutionary radiation into deep waters. Furthermore, it was proposed \n\nthat seep and vent mussels derived from ancestors associated with wood and other organic-\n\nfalls habitats, proving that deep-sea mussels took \u201cwooden steps to deep-sea vents\u201d (Distel \n\net al., 2000; Lorion et al., 2013). This supports the hypothesis of multiple events of vent and \n\nseep colonization across geological time (Distel et al., 2000; Duperron, 2010; Lorion et al., \n\n2013).  \n\nOver time, this evolution from organic-enriched habitats to vent/seep habitats was \n\nunidirectional, indicating an irreversible specialization mainly due to anatomical and \n\nphysiological adaptations (Lorion et al., 2013). It is possible to distinguish two main groups \n\nwithin bathymodiolins: mussels with larger shells living in hydrothermal vents and cold \n\nseeps (genus Bathymodiolus, Gigantidas and Vulcanidas) and smaller mussels that exist \n\npredominantly in sunken organic substrates (genus Idas, Adipicola and Benthomodiolus) \n\n(Lorion et al., 2013; Smith et al., 1998; Smith and Baco, 2003; Taylor and Glover, 2010; \n\nTurner, 1973). \n\nThe main adaptations of mussels to chemosynthetic habitats are related with feeding \n\nand reproductive strategies (Le Pennec and Beninger, 2000). Most bathymodiolins harbor \n\nsulphur-oxidizing and/or methane-oxidizing symbionts in their gill epithelial cells (Duperron \n\net al., 2008; Duperron, 2010; Fisher et al., 1987; Laming et al., 2015a). This relationship \n\nbetween bacteria and mussels are probably the key for the success of mussels in \n\nchemosynthetic environments (Duperron, 2010). Sulphur-oxidizing symbionts occur in \n\nvarious species, opposed to methane-oxidizing symbionts that are extremely rare among \n\nbivalves (Duperron, 2010; Taylor and Glover, 2010). The host-symbiont relationship is not \n\nonly characterized by the symbiont type (sulphur or methane-oxidizing), but also by the \n\nsymbiont abundance and diversity (Duperron et al., 2008; Laming et al., 2015a; Laming et \n\nal., 2015b; Rodrigues et al., 2012). All these features strongly influence the species \n\necological strategies. For instance, high symbiont flexibility (ability of harbor high symbiont \n\ndiversity) indicates the use of diverse energetic sources (Gaudron et al., 2012). \n\nChemosymbiotic mussels did not lose the capability of filter feeding, however they need \n\nreduced compounds to survive, so they have a mixotrophic feeding strategy (Duperron, \n\n2010). \n\nFurthermore, reproductive strategies including reproductive cyclicity, larval stage, trophic \n\nstrategy and rate of larval development, growth rate, maturation period, among other \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n14 \n\nfeatures, also contribute to the ecological success of this subfamily in deep-sea \n\nchemosynthetic habitats (Le Pennec and Beninger, 2000; Turner, 1973; Tyler et al., 2007; \n\nTyler et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n1.3.1. Reproductive adaptations \n\n \n\nThe majority of bathymodiolins are dioecious or successive hermaphrodites (Le Pennec \n\nand Beninger, 2000; Tyler et al., 2009). For instance, the species Idas modiolaeformis, a \n\nsmall bathymodiolin is a protandric hermaphrodite, which means that in the early adult life \n\nthe individual is male, then becomes hermaphroditic and in late adulthood the individual \n\nturns into female (Gaudron et al., 2012; Laming et al., 2014; Tyler et al., 2009).  \n\nReproductive cyclicity appears to depend on the degree of endosymbiosis and presence \n\nof environmental cues, such as organic matter flux and temperatures (Le Pennec and \n\nBeninger, 2000; Tyler et al., 2007). In habitats with few or without environmental cues \n\nspecies can have a discontinuous reproductive activity (mixotrophic species) or continuous \n\nreproductive activity (species with obligate symbionts). In habitats where environmental \n\ncues exist, discontinuous reproductive activity is detected (reviewed in Le Pennec and \n\nBeninger, 2000). For example, the cold-seep species \u201cBathymodiolus\u201d childressi has \n\nperiodic gametogenic cycles (Arellano and Young, 2009). \n\nThe acquisition of larval pelagic stage was another relevant adaptation to colonization of \n\npatchy habitats (Tyler et al., 2007). The trophic strategy of larvae and the larval development \n\nrate can be inferred from the oocyte size. Deep-sea bivalves with small oocytes are \n\nplanktotrophic or exotrophic (feeding larvae) and bivalves with larger oocytes are \n\nlecithotrophic or endotrophic (Arellano and Young, 2011; Danovaro et al., 2014; Le Pennec \n\nand Beninger, 2000). Larval development rate depends on food availability and once again \n\noocyte dimensions. Usually, larger oocytes have faster rates and vice-versa. The trophic \n\nstrategy of larvae influences larval duration and dispersal strategy (reviewed in Le Pennec \n\nand Beninger, 2000). Gaudron et al. (2012) suggested a pelagic larvae duration of 4-5 \n\nmonths for the mussel I. modiolaeformis and also inferred that the larval development is \n\nlikely planktotrophic. \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni has also planktotrophic larvae (Laming et al., 2015a). \n\n\u201cBathymodiolus\u201d childressi has a longer PLD compared to smaller bathymodiolins, as they \n\nare able to remain more than 13 months in the plankton. The occurrence of a planktotrophic \n\nlarva was also demonstrated for this genus (Arellano et al., 2014; Arellano and Young, \n\n2009).  \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Literature review \n\n15 \n\nLastly, growth and maturation rates relate with reproductive strategies. The rapid \n\ndevelopment to achieve reproductive maturity may indicate the species adaptation to patchy \n\nand ephemeral habitats (Gaudron et al., 2012). Bathymodiolus species have an estimated \n\ngrowth rate of 0.048 mm per day (Arellano and Young, 2009). \u201cBathymodiolus\u201d childressi is \n\nconsidered mature with shell sizes ranging between 50-120 mm (Arellano and Young, \n\n2009), corresponding to a maturation age of about 3 years (shell length: 50 mm) (Rhoads \n\net al.,1981). Idas growth rate ranges between 0.017 and 0.029 mm per day, with the first \n\nmaturation being reached at 2-4 months of age (shell length: 2-2.35 mm) (G\u00e9nio et al., \n\n2014; Laming et al., 2015a; Laming et al., 2015b).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1.

FRAMEWORK AND OBJECTIVES  \n\n \n\nPopulation genetic structure is based on the study of DNA variation in natural \n\npopulations. Several methods are used to detect variation in DNA, from mitochondrial DNA \n\nto nuclear DNA, including single base polymorphisms (SNPs), microsatellites, and others. \n\nIn the current study, mitochondrial DNA was chosen due to a number of characteristics \n\nthat allow assessing patterns of genetic variation: 1) it is haploid; 2) in most species, it is \n\nmaternally inherited; 3) it does not undergo recombination and 4) for most metazoan taxa it \n\nevolves rapidly, showing recent divergence events (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; Cowen and \n\nSponaugle, 2009; Hartl and Clark, 1997). For deep-sea mytilids, the mitochondrial DNA \n\nCytochrome Oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene is assumed to diverge at a rate of ? 1-2% per \n\nMyr (Lorion et al., 2012; Won et al., 2003). \n\nSeveral studies to assess deep-sea population connectivity and population structure \n\nhave been conducted recently using the mtCOI gene. For instance, population structure \n\nand connectivity of the shrimp (Chorocaris sp. 2) and the squat lobster (Munidopsis \n\nlauensis) (Thaler et al., 2014); interpopulational relationships of Bathymodiolus \n\nseptemdierum complex in Indo-Pacific deep-sea vents (Breusing et al., 2015); distribution \n\nand population connectivity of several Bathymodiolus species occurring in the Gulf of \n\nMexico cold seeps (Faure et al., 2015). Few genetic connectivity studies have integrated \n\nboth Atlantic and Mediterranean areas (Affinito et al., 2015; Andreakis et al., 2009; Correia \n\net al., 2012; Griffiths et al., 2011). Most studies were focused on either the Atlantic (Bradbury \n\net al., 2014; Cuveliers et al., 2012; Pita et al., 2016; Ribeiro et al., 2010) or the \n\nMediterranean basins (Cal\u00f2 et al., 2016; Casado-Amez\u00faa et al., 2012; F\u00e9lix-Hackradt et al., \n\n2013; Garofalo et al., 2009; Maggi and Gonz\u00e1lez-Wang\u00fcemert, 2015; Pilczynska et al., \n\n2016; Schiavina et al., 2014). In general, the most commonly studied organisms are fishes, \n\nwhereas genetic connectivity of deep-sea chemosynthesis-based populations has not been \n\ninvestigated in this region. \n\nThe deep-sea mussel species found in the Gulf of Cadiz hold a great research potential \n\nfor speciation and divergence over the Atlantic and connectivity in the Eastern \n\nMediterranean seeps (Rodrigues et al., 2012). In this work, two deep-sea mussel species \n\nwere used as study organisms: Idas modiolaeformis (Sturany, 1896) and \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni \n\n(Marshall, 1900) (Figure 5). Idas modiolaeformis (also named Idas sp. Med) has only been \n\nrecorded in cold seep habitats in the Eastern Mediterranean (Duperron et al., 2008), \n\nwestern Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean (Laming, et al., 2015b; Rodrigues et al., 2012). \n\nUnlike the usual dense mussel aggregation, Idas modiolaeformis occurs in low densities of \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Framework and objectives \n\n18 \n\nindividuals and rarely conspecifics have direct contact  (Gaudron et al., 2012; Laming et al., \n\n2015a). \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni occurs on carbonates nearby seeps and bone-fall substrata, \n\nforming several small clumps (G\u00e9nio et al., 2014; Laming et al., 2014). The taxonomy of \n\nthis last species is under discussion, Thubaut and other authors (2013) proposed that \u201cIdas\u201d \n\nsimpsoni sould be included in the genus Nypamodiolus. Because this name has not been \n\nformally accepted, I continue to use the generic name Idas but with quotation marks. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Idas modiolaeformis (A), 11 mm (G\u00e9nio, 2009) and \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni (B), scale bar: 1 mm \n(G\u00e9nio et al., 2014).  \n\n \n\nSamples of I. modiolaeformis were obtained within CHEMECO project. This project \n\ninvestigated the process of colonization in reduced deep-sea habitats along the NE Atlantic \n\nand Mediterranean. The sampling design consisted on deployment and later recovery of \n\ncolonization devices with different types of substrates (wood, alfafa grass and carbonates) \n\nnamed CHEMECOLI - CHEMosynthetic Ecosystem COlonization by Larval Invertebrates \n\n(Cunha et al., 2013b; Gaudron et al., 2010). Idas modiolaeformis mussels were found in \n\nabundance in the wood and alfafa substrates deployed in Mekn\u00e8s and Darwin mud \n\nvulcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. Further specimens of this species were later collected during \n\na research cruise in Gorringe Bank on a wood log (Rodrigues et al., 2012). MtCOI \n\nsequences of Idas modiolaeformis from Mediterranean sites are available in GenBank, \n\nallowing to expand my NE Atlantic dataset and investigate population structure in a larger \n\ngeographic area. \n\nAfter molecular analyses I found \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni specimens that have been mistakenly \n\nidentified as I. modiolaeformis based on morphological traits. The two species have nearly \n\nidentical shells, particularly the younger specimens, which makes it very hard to distinguish \n\nthem (L. G\u00e9nio personnal communication). Therefore, sequences of \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni from \n\nAtlantic and Mediterranean were also obtained from GenBank and added to the my data \n\nanalysis. \n\nMy dissertation aims to study the genetic structure of Idas populations among deep-sea \n\nchemosynthetic habitats of North East Atlantic and Mediterranean. I expect to clarify the \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Framework and objectives \n\n19 \n\ngenetic link between deep-sea populations of Idas species, contributing to the \n\nunderstanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate biogeographic distributions and \n\nbiodiversity dynamics of deep-sea fragmented habitats (Breusing et al., 2015). \n\n \n\nThe main goals of this dissertation are: \n\nI. To characterize the population structure of Idas modiolaeformis and \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni \n\nfound at several deep-sea reduced habitats in the NE Atlantic and in the \n\nMediterranean Sea. \n\nII. To investigate connectivity among the deep-sea reduced and patchy habitats.  \n\nTo achieve these goals, I conducted a number of genetic analyses, including: \n\n- Species molecular identification; \n\n- Phylogenetic reconstruction; \n\n- Neutrality test of sequences from each species/population;  \n\n- Estimates of site-specific genetic-diversity per species; \n\n- Analysis of mitochondrial COI haplotypes (haplotype distribution, frequencies and \n\ndiversity); \n\n- Estimates of population differentiation and partitioning. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

Study area \n\n \n\nThe dataset analyzed in this study includes specimens collected from three locations in \n\nthe Atlantic Ocean (Gorringe Bank, Darwin and Mekn\u00e8s mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz) \n\nand GenBank sequences obtained from these three sites and four additional locations (one \n\nin the Atlantic and three in the Mediterranean Sea). A brief description of geological and \n\nbiological features of the seven collection sites (Figure 6), as well as hydrodynamic \n\ncharacteristics of the study region, and estimated linear distances between locations (Table \n\n1) are presented below. \n\n \n\n3.1.1. Biogeographic features \n\n \n\nSet\u00fabal submarine canyon is located in the Portuguese West margin (Figure 6). Rapid \n\nand episodic flushing occurring at submarine canyons are pathways for transport of \n\nsediment and organic carbon from shelf to deep-sea depths, enhancing local biodiversity. \n\nGorgonians, sponges, hydroids, anemones, sea urchins, sea stars, oysters and \n\nbrachiopods are some of the deep-sea fauna found on Set\u00fabal canyon (Weaver et al., \n\n2007). GenBank sequences were obtained from mussels collected after 18 and 28 months \n\non mammal bones there were experimentally deployed at 1000 m depth (G\u00e9nio et al., 2014). \n\nThe Gorringe Bank (Gor), located South West of Portugal (Figure 6), is a vast undersea \n\nmountain (length: ~ 180 km; ridge\u2019s width: ~ 70 km) raising up 5000 m above seafloor \n(Banda et al., 1995; Karson et al., 2012; Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2013; Tortella et al., 1997). The \n\nGettysburg and Ormonde seamounts represent the Gorringe Bank highest points, about 50 \n\nm below the sea surface (Karson et al., 2012). These elevated structures act as \n\noceanographic barriers inducing local currents, which cause ocean mixing and tidal energy \n\ndissipation (Pitcher et al., 2007; Wessel et al., 2010). As a result of these particular local \n\ncurrents, upwelling can occur around the seamounts, providing nutrients to the deep ocean \n\n(Pitcher et al., 2007). Thus, primary production is increased, enhancing the occurrence of \n\nimportant ecological communities and a high biodiversity (Wessel et al., 2010). At the \n\nGorringe Bank it is possible to find sponges, corals, fish, small sessile species in \n\nabundance, algae, kelp beds, loggerhead turtle and the bottlenose dolphin (Di\u00e1rio da \n\nRep\u00fablica, 2015; Karson et al., 2012; OCEANA, 2005). Samples used in this study came \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Material and methods \n\n22 \n\nfrom a wood log opportunistically collected near the Gettysburg seamount (Laming et al., \n\n2015b; Rodrigues et al., 2012). \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz (GoC), located in the North East Atlantic Ocean, was originated by the \n\ncollision between the European and African plates and the migration of the Betic-Rifean Arc \n\n(Hensen et al., 2007; Medialdea et al., 2004; Tortella et al, 1997). The GoC region contains \n\nmany geological structures associated with fluid escape, such as mud volcanoes, mud-\n\ncarbonate mounds, pockmarks, faults and diapirs (Medialdea et al., 2009). In the GoC, over \n\n40 mud volcanoes (MV\u2019s) exist from the continental shelf to about 3500 m depth (Banda et \n\nal., 1995; Hensen et al., 2007; Medialdea et al., 2009; OCEANA, 2005). Biologic \n\ncommunities at GoC comprise the phyla Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Echinodermata, \n\nincluding some symbiont-hosting species (Cunha et al., 2013a). At the Darwin mud volcano \n\n(Figure 6) shells of Bathymodiolus (\u201cBathymodiolus\u201d mauritanicus), Neptunea contraria \n\n(Linn\u00e9) and less abundant Leptaxinus minutus were registered by Rodrigues et al. (2013; \n\n2008). The Mekn\u00e8s MV (Figure 6) has extensive fields of coral mounds, where Rodrigues \n\net al. (2008) reported the existence of thyasirids (e.g. Thyasira granulosa), empty shells of \n\nN. contraria and some megafauna. Individuals here studied were collected from \n\nCHEMOCOLI colonization devices with pinewood cubes and packed alfafa substrate \n\n(Cunha et al., 2013b; Laming et al., 2015b; Rodrigues et al., 2012).  \n\nLacaze-Duthiers (LD) canyon is located in the North West Mediterranean Sea (Figure \n\n6). This canyon belongs to the Gulf of Lions, where several submarine canyons incise the \n\ncontinental slope at depths superior to 1000 meters. At LD canyon, coral community holds \n\na rich fauna of invertebrates, such as sponges, echinoderms, oysters, ascidians, \n\nbrachiopods and bryozoans. Cephalopods and fishes also occur in LD canyon (Fiala-\n\nMedioni et al., 2012). Mussels were recovered from an experimental deployment of palm \n\ntrunk and pinewood substrate with CHEMOCOLI (Laming et al., 2015b). \n\nAmsterdam mud volcano (Ams) is situated in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea at the \n\nAnaximander Mountains, South of Turkey (Figure 6). The Anaximander Mountains are \n\nassociated to high tectonic deformation and fluids release. Amsterdam MV is characterized \n\nby high methane concentrations and extensive turbid fluid expulsion (Charlou et al., 2003). \n\nAmsterdam mussel samples were collected from carbonate crusts (Laming et al., 2015b). \n\nThe Nile Deep Sea Fan (NDSF) is a sedimentary edifice, located at Eastern \n\nMediterranean Sea (Figure 6).

Hydrodynamic features \n\n \n\nThe location of the GoC, between the Atlantic and the Mediterrenean, its morphology \n\nand also biogeochemical features lead to a peculiar hydrology in this area (Macias et al., \n\n2014; Villanueva and Guti\u00e9rrez-Mas, 1994). The exchange of water between the Atlantic \n\nand the Mediterranean take place at the Gibraltar Strait. The Mediterranean water has \n\nelevated levels of salinity, being denser than the Atlantic water. These differences in water \n\nsalinity and temperature, favour the superficial inflow of Atlantic water and the deep outflow \n\nof Mediterranean water (Villanueva and Guti\u00e9rrez-Mas, 1994). The water that comes from \n\nthe Mediterranean forms meddies on the Iberian slope and on the Gorringe Bank (Quentel \n\net al., 2011; Serra and Ambar, 2002). \n\nThe Mediterranean outflow water has three layers: the superficial, the central and the \n\ndeeper. The superficial flow (500-600 m of depth), after passing by Cape San Vicente, takes \n\ndirection to North, running along the Portugal continental margin. The central flow (700 and \n\n900 m of depth) departs from the continental margin towards the NNW. The deeper flow \n\n(1200 and 1500 m of depth) runs to the NW Atlantic, passing between Cape San Vicente \n\nand Gettysburg seamount (Villanueva and Guti\u00e9rrez-Mas, 1994).  \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Material and methods \n\n24 \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz slope current and offshore flow are the two main inflows to \n\nMediterranean Sea. The Gulf of Cadiz slope current (inshore flow) comes from Cape S. \n\nVicente to Gibraltar Strait, while the offshore flow comes more southern (Peliz et al., 2009; \n\nVillanueva and Guti\u00e9rrez-Mas, 1994). \n\n \n\n3.2. Sampling collection \n\n \n\nSamples of small mussels were collected from wood blocks deployed at Darwin and \n\nMekn\u00e8s mud-volcanoes (Gulf of Cadiz) within the scope of CHEMECO project. Additional \n\nmussel samples were obtained from a wood log opportunistically found near the Gettysburg \n\nseamount (Gorringe Bank) (Cunha et al., 2013b; Rodrigues et al., 2012). Sampling \n\ninformation is detailed in Table 2. On board, artificial substrates with attached macrofauna \n\nwere preserved in 96% ethanol. Later, samples were sorted and mussel shells and tissue \n\nwere separated and placed in new vials (new ethanol solution). \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Sampling site details: collection site, respective coordinates (Latitude/ Longitude) and \ndepth (m), cruise and year of sampling (date), number of specimens used for DNA extraction (N). \n \n\nSite Latitude/ Longitude Depth (m) Cruise (date) N \n\nGorringe Bank \n\n(Gor) \n\n36\u00b038.557?

Molecular analyses \n\n \n\nDNA extraction was performed using three different extraction kits: DNeasy Blood &amp; \n\nTissues kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), QIAamp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and \n\nISOLATE II Genomic DNA kit (Bioline, Taunton, MA).  \n\nMost of the extracted DNA was 1% diluted for amplification of the mitochondrial DNA \n\nCytochrome Oxidase subunit I (mtCOI). PCR temperature profile was equal for all samples: \n\n94-4\u2019 - [95-1\u2019- 47-1\u2019 - 72-1\u2019] - 72-10\u2019 (x35) (Rodrigues et al., 2012). The primers used were \n\nLCO-1560F (5'-ATRCTDATTCGWATTGA-3') and HCO-2148R (5'-\n\nCCYCTAGGRTCATAAAAAGA-3') (Jones et al., 2006). Two different PCR protocols were \n\nused:  \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Material and methods \n\n25 \n\nProtocol A - In a total volume of 20.0 ?L, 2.0 ?L of DNA template (1/100 dilution) and \n13.8 ?L MilliQ water, 0.5 ?L of 10 ?M both forward and reverse primers, 0.4 ?L of 10 mM \ndNTP mix (Bioline, UK), 2.0 ?L of 10x NH4 reaction buffer (Bioline, UK), 0.7 ?L of 50 mM \nMgCl2 solution (Bioline, UK), 0.1 ?L of 5 u/?L BIOTAQTM DNA polymerase (Bioline, UK);  \n\nProtocol B - In a total volume of 20 ?L, 1.0 ?L of DNA template (not diluted), 14.7 ?L \nMilliQ water, 4.0 ?L of 5x MyTaqTM reaction Buffer (Bioline, UK), 0.1 ?L of 100 ?M both \nprimers and 0.1 ?L of 5 u/?L MyTaqTM DNA polymerase (Bioline, UK). \n\nMost of the times, a nested PCR was carried out using the product of the first PCR as \n\nDNA template. Thermocyclers used were TProfessional basic or Biometra TRIO (Biometra, \n\nAnalitik Jena). For more detailed information about molecular methods for each sample see \n\nAppendix I \u2013 Supplementary Table I.  \n\nPCR products were visualized through gel electrophoresis, using the molecular ladder \n\nHyperladder\u2122 50bp (Bioline, UK). Agarose gel was prepared with 0.8 g agarose, 80 mL 1x \n\nTAE buffer (Thermo Scientific) and 5 ?L Sybersafe (Thermofisher Scientific) or SyberGreen \n(NZYTech). Electrophoresis images were obtained using BIO-RAD Molecular Imager\u00ae \n\nChemiDocTM XRS+. \n\nPCR products were purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) \n\nand sent for bidirectional sequencing at the Macrogen laboratory (Amsterdam).   \n\n \n\n3.4.

Data analyses \n\n \n\nA total of 93 sequences were analysed, corresponding to 15 sequences obtained in this \n\nstudy and 78 sequences acquired in GenBank (Benson et al., 2005).  \n\nAll 15 sequences obtained in this study were trimmed, paired and clipped using BioEdit \n\nSequence Alignment Editor version 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999). Gaps were filled manually, as well \n\nas conservative sites to increase sequence length. The total length of all the sequences \n\n(obtained in this study and from the GenBank) obtained was 437bp. To ensure the correct \n\ntranslation of the sequence from nucleotide to protein, sequences were evaluated using \n\nEMBOSS online tool Transeq (Goujon et al., 2010; Rice et al., 2000) (available from \n\nwww.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/st/emboss_transeq). All sequences were aligned using ClustalW \n\nMultiple alignment with 1000 bootstraps (NJ tree) run in BioEdit software. After the \n\nalignment, smaller sequences were excluded (4), obtaining a total of 89 sequences (14 \n\nsequences of this study and 75 sequences of GenBank). \n\nBest Fit Model was run in MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013). Phylogenetic maximum \n\nlikelihood (ML) tree was performed using MEGA 6.0 software, selecting 1000 bootstraps, \n\nTamura and Nei (1993) nucleotide substitutions model (determined by Best Fit Model), \n\ngamma distribution for rate variation among polymorphic sites (5 discrete gamma \n\ncategories), first and second codon positions and Nearest-Neighbour-Interchange (NNI) for \n\ninference options of ML heuristic method. \n\nDnaSP software v. 5.10.01 (Rozas, 2009) was used to calculate several genetic diversity \n\nindices: number of sequences; number of polymorphic/segregating sites (S); total number \n\nof mutations (Eta); number of haplotypes (h); haplotype diversity (Hd) with respective \n\nvariation and standard deviation and nucleotide diversity (?). Tajima\u2019s and Fu and Li tests \nwere performed with DnaSP to validate data neutrality. \n\nHaplotype network was obtained with Network 4.6.1.4 (Fluxus Technology Ltd, 1999-\n\n2016), using a median-joining method (Bandelt et al, 1999). ARLEQUIN software v. 3.5.2.2 \n\n(Excoffier and Lischer, 2010) was used to assess genetic structure through AMOVA (k=1). \n\nSignificance tests were calculated with 1023 permutations. Spatial Analysis of Molecular \n\nVariance (SAMOVA) is an AMOVA that correlates geographical and genetic distances \n\namong populations. This analysis was performed for different numbers of groups (k=2, 3, 4 \n\nand 5) with SAMOVA 1.0 (Dupanloup et al., 2002). Pairwise genetic distances were \n\ncalculated in ARLEQUIN and plotted against geographical distances showed in Table 1 \n\n(Microsoft Excel 2016). Mantel test for matrix correlation between genetic (Fst) and \n\ngeographic (km) distances was performed with 1000 permutations using the online Isolation \n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Sequencing success rate \n\n \n\nDNA was extracted from a total of 77 mussel individuals (Table 2), but it was only \n\npossible to amplify and sequence the mtCOI gene of 15 specimens (Appendix I). Less than \n\nhalf of the extracted samples were successfully amplified (43%), and the number of \n\nsuccessful sequences obtained was then reduced to 42%, giving a final success rate of \n\n18% (excluding one partial sequence) (Figure 7).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7 \u2013 Number of samples obtained after each laboratory step. \n\n \nOut of the 14 sequences obtained, 12 sequences belong to the species Idas \n\nmodiolaeformis and two belong to \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni.

Results \n\n32 \n\nThe phylogenetic tree clearly reveals two main groups that separate each studied \n\nspecies into one of two different clades (Figure 8). Within each species, no segregation was \n\nobserved for the different geographic locations.  \n\nTajima\u2019s D test did not show statistical significance for each singular population and for \n\nall populations of Idas modiolaeformis (Table 5), meaning that these sequences follow a \n\nneutral evolution model. The Lacaze-Duthiers canyon (LD) population is not shown in Table \n\n5, because Tajima\u2019s D test requires a minimum of 4 sequences to perform calculations.  \n\nThe Tajima\u2019s D value obtained for \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni showed statistical significance for \n\nSet\u00fabal population and for all populations (Table 5), which means that mtCOI gene of this \n\nspecies is not in accordance with neutral evolution. The number of sequences from Mekn\u00e8s \n\n(N=2) and LD (N=3) was too low to perform Tajima\u2019s D test. \n\nFu and Li tests for neutrality were performed too, revealing the same results as Tajima\u2019s \n\nD test (see in Appendix II \u2013 Supplementary Table II).  \n\n \n\nTable 5 \u2013 Results of Tajima\u2019s test for neutrality.

Sequencing success rate \n\n \n\nIn this study, the success of molecular sequencing was very low (18%). Other studies \n\nrevealed unsuccessful amplification of mitochondrial genes, NADH dehydrogenase subunit \n\n4 in mussels (Boschen et al., 2015; Faure et al., 2015) and mtCOI in crustaceans (Asmyhr \n\nand Cooper, 2012). The amplification success rate of Asmyhr and Cooper (2012) was  less \n\nthan 20%, a lower value than the present study amplification rate (43%). \n\nOne possible explanation for the low success rate is related to the preservation of \n\nspecimens. Recommendations indicate any fixative to have larger volume (5x-10x) than the \n\nspecimen volume (Geiger et al., 2007). Because the specimens were preserved still \n\nattached to the wood cubes (CHEMOCOLI samples) and wood log (Gorringe samples) the \n\nvolume of ethanol should have been much higher than the one used. It is also possible that \n\nethanol did not reach the tissue inside the shells. Concerning fixation of small mussels for \n\nmolecular work, it is recommended to drill or break the shell, so that the ethanol reaches \n\nthe tissue. In order to preserve the shell for taxonomic identifications and other envisioned \n\napproaches, shell drilling was not performed. Regarding the storage of the tissue it is \n\nadvised to replace the ethanol solution in the first days, due to tissue dehydration (Geiger \n\net al., 2007; Prendini et al., 2002). The shell and tissue of most samples were later (> one \n\nyear) separated and kept in 96% ethanol, with replacement of the solution, although some \n\ntissue dehydration could have happened during specimen dissection. \n\n \n\n5.2. Phylogenetic reconstruction \n\n \nThe phylogenetic tree showed a clear separation of I. modiolaeformis and \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni, \n\nand no segregation of individuals within each species per geographic location. The tree \n\nbranches had low support because only the mitochondrial gene was used, and a \n\ncombination of this and more conservative genes (e.g. nuclear markers) is needed to \n\nresolve phylogenetic relationships (Hartl and Clark, 1997).  \n\nRegarding neutral evolution of the mtCOI gene, results revealed neutrality for I. \n\nmodiolaeformis, but not for \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni. Thus, divergence results for I. modiolaeformis can \n\nbe interpreted as a balance of gene flow (when divergence is reduced) and genetic drift \n\n(when divergence is increased). In the case of \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni neutrality test was probably \n\nbiased due to the low number of sequences per population (Mek: N=2; LD: N=3 \u2013 Table 7). \n\nNevertheless, Set\u00fabal population had a good representation (N=32) and still Tajima\u2019s D test \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Discussion \n\n42 \n\ndid not support neutrality for mtCOI gene, suggesting that this gene might be under \n\nselection. Therefore, gene flow and genetic drift cannot be considered the only factors \n\nresponsible for the genetic differences, as natural selection has to be considered as well \n\n(Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; Hartl and Clark, 1997). For these reasons, genetic \n\ndifferentiation analyses (AMOVA, SAMOVA, Fst pairwise distances) were not performed for \n\n\u201cI.\u201d simpsoni. \n\n \n\n5.3. Site-specific genetic-diversity per species \n\n \nA great discrepancy of the number of sequences analyzed per population in each \n\nspecies was translated also in great differences in estimated genetic indices. A low number \n\nof individuals per site (<10-20) can either underestimate or overestimate indices, thus all \n\ninterpretations have to be made with caution. For instance, maximum haplotype diversity \n\n(Hd=1) was found when the number of sequences was low (2-3) and each one represented \n\na different haplotype (e.g. Amsterdam population of I. modiolaeformis; Mekn\u00e8s and LD \n\npopulations of \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni).  \n\nNevertheless, genetic diversity values reported in this study (Table 6) are within the \n\nrange of observed values in other bathymodiolin species. The values of polymorphic sites \n\n(S) in I. modiolaeformis and \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni were 26 and 17, respectively. Faure et al. (2015) \n\nreported 21 polymorphic sites in Bathymodiolus brooksi, while in B. thermophilus varied \n\nbetween 8 and 27 (Plouviez et al., 2013). I found a haplotype diversity of 0.689 for I. \n\nmodiolaeformis and 0.782 for \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni, fitting the values already observed in other \n\ndeep-sea mussels. Haplotype diversity ranged between 0.292 (B. nov. sp. GoM) to 0.909 \n\n(B. childressi) in Faure et al. (2015) study. \n\nComparing Atlantic and Mediterranean populations for both species, Atlantic populations \n\nshowed higher values of polymorphic sites, mutations and haplotypes indicating a higher \n\ngenetic diversity. It is interesting to note that Darwin population for I. modiolaeformis, with \n\nonly seven individuals, showed a high value of polymorphic sites (S=21) and haplotype \n\ndiversity (Hd=0.714) compared to NDSF population that showed a lower number of \n\npolymorphic sites and genetic diversity (S=3; Hd=0.410) within 25 individuals sampled. \n\nAlthough sampling limitations can influence haplotype diversity, these results may suggest \n\nthat NDSF population is more isolated. Overall, \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni exhibited 16 haplotypes out of \n\n37 individuals, while I. modiolaeformis with more individuals (52) showed only 11 \n\nhaplotypes. Numerous haplotypes further support the rejection of gene neutrality, \n\nsuggesting that \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni population is under selection. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Discussion \n\n43 \n\n5.4. Population structure \n\n \n\nIdas modiolaeformis and \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni are separated by 71 mutations, as shown in the \n\nhaplotype network (Figure 9). The occurrence of one dominant haplotype for each species \n\n(Hap1 in I. modiolaeformis, and Hap19 in \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni) suggests ancestral polymorphisms \n\nshared between most sampled populations: Dar, Gor, Ams, NDSF for I. modiolaeformis, \n\nand Set, Mek, LD for \u201cI.\u201d simpsoni. High genetic differentiation (Fst=0.35, Table 8) among I. \n\nmodiolaeformis populations across the entire geographic region provides evidence for \n\nsegregation of populations. Differentiation within populations is responsible for 64.5% of the \n\nvariation found, in accordance with the highly discrepant site-specific genetic diversity. \n\nHaplotype distribution provides evidence to explain two possible population-partitioning \n\nscenarios of Idas modiolaeformis. On one hand (scenario k=3), the Mediterranean \n\npopulations (NDSF, Ams and LD) are separated from the Atlantic populations, which are \n\nsplit in two clusters: 1) Gor + Mek and 2) Dar. Darwin population holds two unique \n\nhaplotypes (Hap3 and Hap8) in 5 out of 7 individuals and shares one more divergent \n\nhaplotype (Hap10) with the other two Atlantic populations. On the other hand (scenario \n\nk=4), the two Eastern Mediterranean populations (NDSF and Ams) are segregated from a \n\ncentral group of two populations on both sides of the Gibraltar Strait (LD and Mek), and two \n\nother Atlantic populations, Darwin MV and Gorringe Bank. LD unique haplotype (Hap7) is \n\nonly shared with Mekn\u00e8s, while Gorringe holds three unique haplotypes (Hap5, Hap9 and \n\nHap11). \n\nAlthough the first partitioning scenario (k=3) suggested an apparent segregation \n\nbetween Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, the present data does not allow us to \n\nexclude the occurrence of gene flow across the Gibraltar Strait. Connectivity between \n\nAtlantic and Mediterranean populations has previously been studied. Affinito et al. (2015) \n\nshowed high genetic connectivity and bidirectional migration of tunicates between Atlantic \n\nand Mediterranean. Correia et al. (2012) also showed genetic connectivity of conger ell \n\nbetween the two areas.  \n\nDespite the shorter geographic distances (47-448 km) among Atlantic populations, these \n\nsites showed significant (p-value<0.05) pairwise genetic distances (Fst: Dar-Gor=0.26, Dar-\n\nMek=0.35 and Mek-Gor=0.41) just slightly lower than populations that are separated by \n\nmore than 1000 km (Fst: Dar-LD=0.51, Gor-LD=0.54 and LD-NDSF=0.66) or even farther \n\naway (>3000 km, Fst: Dar-NDSF=0.42 and Mek-NDSF=0.57). The lowest (non-significant) \n\npairwise genetic distances were found between populations of two very distant geographic \n\nsites (>3300 m), suggesting that sufficient gene flow may be occurring between them. Gene \n\nflow between Dar-Ams (Fst=0.15<0.20) is sufficient to avoid harmful effects of local \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Discussion \n\n44 \n\ninbreeding, whereas higher gene flow between Gor-NDSF (Fst=0.016<0.020) is sufficient \n\nto maintain similar allele frequencies (Lowe and Allendorf, 2010).  \n\nThe lack of correlation (R2=0.024, p>0.05) between geographic and genetic distances \n\n(Figure 10) provides evidence for an island model of population structure. The low genetic \n\ndistances could result from the mixing of larvae by ocean currents and their transport over \n\nlong distances, that may form one large and common gene pool contributing to gene input \n\nin smaller populations (Altukhov, 2006). A low genetic differentiation across large \n\ngeographic regions was previously reported in mussel populations in the East and West \n\nPacific hydrothermal vents (Breusing et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2013). Moreover, the \n\nconnection between populations can also be guaranteed by multiple and patchy \n\nintermediate habitats that allow gene exchange between closer populations, linking \n\npopulations that are farther apart (stepping-stone model) (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; \n\nBreusing et al., 2015). \n\nConnectivity between Atlantic and Mediterranean mussel populations may be explained \n\nby their long-distance dispersal capabilities and ocean currents in this geographic region. \n\nIdas modiolaeformis larvae are likely planktotrophic and have an estimated pelagic duration \n\nof 4-5 months (Gaudron et al., 2012). Similar to other bathymodiolin mussels, it is likely that \n\nthese larvae perform vertical migration, moving up hundreds of meters to use faster currents \n\nat the surface allowing them colonize distant habitats (Arellano et al., 2014). This dispersal \n\nstrategy can explain the low genetic distances among geographical distant populations \n\n(Carney et al., 2006). Superficial inflow of Atlantic water at ~100 m depth (Villanueva and \n\nGuti\u00e9rrez-Mas, 1994) may transport larvae between regions in the Atlantic to the \n\nMediterranean. However, larval transport may also occur in Mediterranean-Atlantic \n\ndirection, through Mediterranean outflow water (Villanueva and Guti\u00e9rrez-Mas, 1994), \n\nconsidering that larvae would stay in deeper water layers (approx. 500-1500 m of depth). \n\nOther examples in literature support the idea that Atlantic populations may serve as larval \n\nsources to Mediterranean populations (Bouchet and Taviani, 1992). The higher genetic \n\ndiversity found in the Atlantic mussel populations suggested that larval transport is more \n\nlikely to occur from Atlantic to Mediterranean.  \n\nPanmictic populations are generally assumed for long-distance dispersal larvae \n\n(Arellano and Young, 2009). However, the present data does not support the occurrence of \n\npanmixia across the entire geographic region. Yet, sampling gaps can influence the power \n\nof differentiation analyses. Our Fst values might be overestimated, due to the low number \n\nof sequences and a single gene marker (Vrijenhoek, 2010). Further investigations with \n\nincreased number of sequences (individuals) and populations, and additional genetic data \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Discussion \n\n45 \n\n(e.g., nuclear SNPs and allozyme) are needed to confirm these results. This information will \n\nbe crucial to understand source-sink dynamics that are useful to conservation management, \n\nparticularly regarding the inter-MPA connectivity (Bell, 2008). The implementation of the \n\nGorringe Bank MPA demands further connectivity studies in the Atlantic and Mediterranean \n\nregion for its sustainable management. For instance, it is important to investigate whether \n\ndeep-sea mussel populations from Atlantic and Mediterranean are connected by \n\ncontemporary dispersal, or if historic connectivity has persisted to present day and \n\npopulations did not have enough time to become isolated. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH \n\n \nThe low number of individuals per population as well the discrepant number of \n\nsequences among populations limited the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, the \n\npresent data indicated that \u201cIdas\u201d simpsoni and Idas modiolaeformis populations from \n\nMediterranean and North East Atlantic are not geographically isolated. The two studied \n\nspecies showed one dominant haplotype suggesting shared ancestral polymorphisms \n\nbetween populations across entire geographic region. In the case of I. modiolaeformis, the \n\noverall high genetic differentiation indicates that metapopulation is structured, particularly \n\nthrough differences within populations. The low genetic distances found between Atlantic \n\nand East Mediterranean populations indicate gene flow over >3000 km distance. Genetic \n\nand geographic distances are not correlated, supporting an island model of population \n\nstructure. Additional samples and other genetic markers are needed to clarify the genetic \n\nstructure of Idas metapopulations in the studied region. \n\nThis study provided insights into gene exchange between deep-sea habitats in the \n\nMediterranean, Gulf of Cadiz and the Gorringe Bank, which was recently established as a \n\nMarine Protected Area. Further studies are necessary to understand the recolonization \n\npotencial and source-sink dynamics among these areas (Boschen et al., 2015; Marshall et \n\nal., 2009), in order to comprehend resilience of populations to natural and human impacts, \n\nenabling a sustainable management of deep-sea ecosystems.  \n\nIn addition to genetic data, demographic studies (size of population, number of self-\n\nrecruits and migrants, mortality and birth rates) may allow to infer more realistic estimates \n\nof population structure. Considering connectivity of organisms with pelagic larvae stage, \n\nlarval dispersal and hydrology play a relevant role. Studies about timing and location of \n\nlarval release, larval behavior, mortality rate, PLD estimates and transport distances, are \n\nimportant to better understand dispersal process. Artificial markers (for example, \n\nfluorescent dyes) have been used to follow the movement of larvae, nevertheless dilution \n\nof larvae in natural environment is very high, making this method unfeasible (revewied in \n\nLevin, 2006). However, natural makers such stable isotope signatures of tissues and \n\ngeochemical fingerprinting can also be informative about larval dispersal (Cowen and \n\nSponaugle, 2009; G\u00e9nio et al., 2015; Levin, 2006). Biophysical models incorporating \n\nhydrology, three-dimension reality and more realistic estimates of larval biology (behavior, \n\nmortality, PLD, etc) are another powerful method to obtain comprehensive information \n\nabout larval dispersal at various spatial and temporal scales.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Conclusions and future research \n\n48 \n\nStudying deep-sea ecology has financial and technical limitations, so is important gather \n\nas much information from the data already collected and share the information to the \n\nscientific community, not only through scientific publications but also in online databases. \n\nThus, perspectives of several study areas help to provide more realistic approaches. In this \n\nscientific field, multidisciplinary cooperative work can result in quite significant discoveries.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n49 \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAffinito, O., Andreakis, N., Caputi, L., Marino, R., Pannone, R., Sordino, P., and Procaccini, G. \n(2015).
