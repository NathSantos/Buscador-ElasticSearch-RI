Para esse efeito, o \nestudo \u00e9 baseado numa extensa revis\u00e3o da literatura sobre geoparques, \ngeoturismo e turismo sustent\u00e1vel, bem como a atividade em rede e inova\u00e7\u00e3o \naplicada aos geoparques registados na Rede Global de Geoparques. \nCom base na revis\u00e3o da literatura, uma s\u00e9rie de hip\u00f3teses s\u00e3o formuladas \npara serem depois testadas na parte emp\u00edrica da tese. A popula\u00e7\u00e3o estudada \nconstou dos geoparques registados na Rede Global de Geoparques (N = 64), \nem 2009, a n\u00edvel internacional. O primeiro question\u00e1rio investigou o papel dos \ngeoparques no desenvolvimento rural e O segundo question\u00e1rio analisou a \natividade em rede entre geoparques e avaliar a taxa de conectividade da Rede \nGlobal de Geoparques e da Rede Europeia de Geoparques. \n\n                                                           A realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de entrevistas a n\u00edvel local permitiram revelar os efeitos \nsignificativos e tang\u00edveis da cria\u00e7\u00e3o de geoparques no desenvolvimento local. \nAssim, foi selecionado o Qeshm Geopark (Ir\u00e3o) como estudo de caso, e as \ncomunidades locais que vivem nas aldeias vizinhas do geoparque foram \nentrevistados.  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Os dados foram analisados atrav\u00e9s de softwares de apoio \u00e0 an\u00e1lise \nquantitativa, qualitativa e de redes, tais como o SPSS, NVivo e Pajek, \nrespetivamente. Este \u00faltimo foi utilizado para produzir uma imagem da rede de \nrelacionamento social entre os geoparques entrevistados. \nCom base nesses resultados uma s\u00e9rie de implica\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o sugeridas, bem \ncomo algumas recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es para futuras pesquisas. \nPara al\u00e9m disso, a fim de investigar o papel do estabelecimento do Qeshm \nGeopark para o desenvolvimento rural, o trabalho de campo envolveu ainda \nentrevistas face a face com as comunidades locais e tr\u00eas matrizes SWOT \nforam projetadas para uma melhor gest\u00e3o dos geoparques. \nUtilizando ambas as abordagens qualitativa e quantitativa, esta tese visa \ncontribuir para uma melhor compreens\u00e3o do novo nicho de mercado que \nconstitui o geoturismo, bem como dos novos destinos desenvolvidos em torno \ndos geoparque. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nTable\u00a0of\u00a0contents\u00a0\nTable of contents .................................................................................................................................. i \n\nList of tables ........................................................................................................................................ vi \n\nList of figures ..................................................................................................................................... viii \n\nAppendices ......................................................................................................................................... x \n\nList of abbreviations  .......................................................................................................................... xii  \n\n\u00a0\n\nCHAPTER 1- Introduction \n1.1.

General Introduction  \nThe tourism sector is a \u2018market\u2019 that uses cultural and natural heritage as a support for its \n\nbackbone activities, such as promotion of destinations, accommodation, transportation, \n\nand catering. Hence, the new concept of geotourism as a new niche market with special \n\ninterest in the geo \u2013 geology, geomorphology, and geodiversity\u2013 can add opportunities to \n\ncultural sustainability and rural development. Geotourism as a branch of sustainable tour-\n\nism allows tourists and visitors to travel in a territory in order to experience, learn from, \n\nand enjoy earth heritage. \n\nAt present, geotourism is a new movement helping travellers to increase their knowledge \n\nabout natural resources, the cultural identity of host communities, and ways of preserving \n\nthem. The \u2018emerging tourism\u2019 niche of geotourism is still at an early stage of commercial \n\ndevelopment in most countries, and geoparks as a sustainable development model for \n\nprotected areas are pioneers in the development of geotourism marketing. Likewise, the \n\nrapidly increasing numbers of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi-\n\nzation (UNESCO) registered geoparks, up to 87 at the end of 2011 ( Newsome et al., \n\n2011), is good news for promoting geotourism and sustainable socioeconomic activities in \n\nrural areas. \n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) intro-\n\nduced the geopark as a nationally protected area including a number of geological heri-\n\ntage sites of particular importance (geosites), rarity or aesthetic appeal. A geopark attains \n\nits goals through conservation, education, and geotourism (UNESCO, 2006a). It is worth \n\nmentioning that in many cases, geoparks are not nationally protected areas which depend \n\non the national laws for those territories.  \n\nAccording to the European Geoparks Network (EGN) charter and Global Geoparks Net-\n\nwork regulations, geoparks should be established in rural areas (Zouros and Martini, \n\n2003); thus, geoparks and geotourism can be opportunities for rural development, as they \n\ncan effectively reduce the rate of unemployment and migration in rural areas by creating \n\ninnovative strategies for local development. UNESCO and National Geographic Traveler\u2019s \n\ndeclaration illustrated that geotourism has opened a new gateway to rural development \n\n(Zouros, 2010; Farsani et al., 2011a). It may be said that geotourism encompasses rural \n\ntourism and sustains or even enhances the geological characteristics of a place. Further-\n\nmore, geotourism follows sustainability principles, and thus it can be said that geotourism \n\nis under the umbrella of sustainable tourism. Sustainability as a general concept for tour-\n\n\n\nChapter 1- Introduction \n\n2 \n\nism has three interconnected aspects: environmental, sociocultural, and economic \n\n(Cottrell et al., 2007). \n\nGeotourism and geoparks claim to promote the local economy by sustainable tourism \n\n(McKeever and Zouros, 2005). Geoparks, by increasing the number of tourists visiting \n\nwell-structured geological attractions, play an important role in the development of the  \n\nlocal economy. When geotourists move to geoparks, the money moves in the same direc-\n\ntion, as if geoparks were in fact exporting something such as agricultural and local prod-\n\nucts to other places. Geoparks have to support the local commercial production. Thus, \n\nvisitors to geoparks can actually take with them, together with emotions, experiences and \n\nknowledge, manufactured goods (Frey et al., 2006). Moreover, geoparks strive to involve \n\nlocal communities in new job opportunities and geo-marketing, such as geotours, geo-\n\nproducts, geo-museums, geo-sports, geo-lodging, geo-restaurants and geo-bakeries.  \n\nGeoparks aim to promote the local economy and public awareness about geology.  \n\nRegarding this, development of geotours guided by local people can be a strategy towards \n\nentrepreneurship. Geotour guides visit natural scenic landforms and explain the surface \n\nand inner earth processes that have shaped them (Robinson, 2008). \n\nA geopark, besides tourism marketing, can successfully perform educational tasks for \n\nchildren including schoolchildren, and for local communities. The last but not the least of \n\ngeopark targets is conservation. There is a direct relationship between geotourism and \n\ngeoconservation; this relation directly influences the popularization of the geologic knowl-\n\nedge, didactics and scientific studies in this domain, as well as recreation (Alexandrowicz, \n\n2006). \n\nFurthermore, geopark conservation indirectly influences the socioeconomic prosperity of \n\nlocal people in the countryside of the geopark. Indigenous knowledge of local people and \n\ntheir work force are two key components in implementation of conservation methods in \n\ngeoparks.  \n\nThe major objective of this study is to investigate how geoparks and geotourism can  \n\ncontribute to sustainable tourism.  \n\nThis thesis aims to evaluate the role played by geoparks in the development of the local \n\neconomy, and minimization of negative sociocultural and environmental impacts of tour-\n\nism. This is achieved by creating a positive upgrade in land management and planning for \n\ngeoconservation and sustainable development of geological heritage. \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Introduction \n\n    3 \n\nConsequently, this thesis strives to identify geotourism and geoparks as a gateway and \n\nnovel strategy for sociocultural, socio-environmental, and socioeconomic sustainability in \n\nrural areas. Moreover, this study has two more major purposes: 1) to determine the  \n\ncollaboration areas in Global Geoparks Network (GGN) and European Geoparks Network \n\n(EGN), and 2) to measure the degree of collaboration and cooperation among geoparks \n\nas geotourism destinations.  \n\nAdditionally, the author focuses on innovative strategies in geoparks around the world in \n\norder to introduce geotourism as a market that can provide unique experiences for visitors \n\nthrough initiatives. It is evident that geoparks offer different facilities to tourists that are \n\nnever experienced in other tourist destinations. Therefore, geoparks are new tourism des-\n\ntinations for geotravelers who want to know more about the earth where they live.  \n\n \n\n1.2. Objectives and Methodology \n\nThe research methodology for this study includes both primary and secondary research. A \n\nCombined method (qualitative and quantitative) was selected in this thesis. The first phase \n\nconsists of an extensive literature review of existing reports on concepts of sustainable \n\ntourism, geotourism and geoparks. \n\nThe main objective of the study presented in this survey is to seek how geoparks and \n\ngeotourism can contribute to sustainable tourism (Figure 1.1).  \n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1.1, the objectives 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 and the hypotheses 3 and 7 \n\nevaluate the socio-economical impacts of establishment of geoparks on rural development \n\nand development of geopark territories. Furthermore, objectives 1 and 4 and the hypothe-\n\nses 4, 6, and 9 strive to identify the innovative and novel strategies in geoparks for pro-\n\nmoting geotourism and attracting more tourists to these new destinations. The hypotheses \n\n5, 6 and 8 and the objective 4 inquiry the role of geoparks in cultural sustainability and \n\nalso investigate the strategies which highlight rural identities. Moreover, the Objective 5 \n\nand the hypotheses 1 and 2 examine the socio-environmental impacts of geoparks as  \n\nanother dimension of sustainable development.  Lastly, the objective 6 and the hypothe-\n\nses 1 and 2 evaluate the role played by tourism, especially geotourism, in achieving a bet-\n\nter quality of life and education for local population and in stimulating economic growth in \n\ngeoparks territories.  \n\nObservation was a technique used by author. Organizing field trips around the Naturtejo \n\nGeopark (Portugal), Arouca Geopark (Portugal) and Qeshm Geopark (Iran) helped the \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Introduction \n\n4 \n\nresearcher to gain more understanding of the terms geopark and geotourism and to \n\nachieve a new vision of geopark activities.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that travelling to all geoparks was expensive and time consuming, hence \n\nquestionnaires were designed for data gathering. Data for this research were collected at \n\ntwo levels (international level and local level). Firstly, an electronic questionnaire sent to \n\ngeoparks registered in UNESCO Global Geopark Networks; this questionnaire investi-\n\ngated the new strategies, policy and activities of geoparks. Gathering international data \n\nwas conducted in two phases, the first phase was from March 2009 to January 2010 and \n\nthe second \u2013 which related to collaboration between geoparks \u2013 from October to Novem-\n\nber 2010. These phases can be a way to get experiences from different strategies in \n\ngeoparks to find the best solution for amelioration of the case study.  \n\nIn the next phase the Qeshm Geopark (Iran) was selected as a case study and a ques-\n\ntionnaire was designed for the local communities who live in the surrounding villages of \n\nQeshm Geopark.  Interviews in face-to face format at local level were conducted from July \n\nto August 2009. The questionnaires aim at evaluating the economic problems in rural  \n\nareas and the role played by Qeshm Geopark in the development of the local economy \n\nand minimization of negative sociocultural and environmental impacts of tourism in local \n\ncommunities.  \n\nIn this research the data was analysed using SPSS tools, NVivo, and Pajek software. \n\nApart from quantitative and qualitative methods, SWOT analysis was applied to examine \n\nthe strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats in the Qeshm Geopark territory.   \n\nAt the end I am expected to create a methodology concerning different stages to promote \n\nsustainable tourism in geopark.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1- Introduction \n\n6 \n\n1.3. Interest and Scope of the Thesis \n\nNowadays tourists want to find out more about the outside world. They want to try out new \n\nexperiences and increase their knowledge (Poon, 1993). It can be said that new frame-\n\nwork conditions such as airline deregulation, economic restructuring, environmental \n\nawareness, consumer protection, and the increased spread and flexibility of vacation \n\ndays, are giving rise to a new tourism (Poon, 1993). \n\nIn the last decade, geotourism has been introduced as a new niche market that shows \n\ntravellers how to increase their awareness about natural resources and ways of preserv-\n\ning them by outdoor and recreational activities. In geoparks, tourists can see something \n\ndifferent from other tourism activities. According to the National Geographic definition, \n\n\u201cGeotourism is a market of about 55.1 million travelers who seek authentic experiences, \n\ncare about the protection and preservation of the places they visit, and are willing to spend \n\nmore money to achieve these goals. Average ages range from 43-55 years, average \n\nhousehold incomes are high with 38-46% earning more than $75,000 annually, average \n\nnumber of leisure trips taken each year is 4 or more, and education levels are also high1\u201d. \n\nRegarding their high education, geotourists require the opportunity to take advantage of \n\neducational and interpretative facilities provided by tourism organizations. Nowadays \n\ngeoparks are ideal destinations for tourists, since, as a living outdoor museum and mes-\n\nsengers of geotourism, they apply innovative strategies, which not only improve the local \n\neconomy but also develop tourists\u2019 knowledge. Moreover, involving indigenous people in \n\nlocal geotourism marketing helps to increase cultural communication between geotourists \n\nand local communities. This study introduces geoparks as new tourism destinations for \n\nthose who are interested in local culture and natural sciences, in particular geosciences, \n\nand for those willing to learn more about their place in our dynamic earth. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n1 National geographic (2009) ; \n\nhttp://industry.traveloregon.com/upload/otc/departments/tourismdevelopment/geotourismwebsiterfpfinal.pdf \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1- Introduction \n\n    7 \n\n1.4. Organization of the Thesis  \nThe thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter identifies the main objectives of \n\nthe thesis; the methodology adopted to reach them; and the thesis\u2019 organization. Chapter \n\ntwo begins with a description of sustainable tourism in order to identify principles and  \n\nobjectives of sustainable tourism. Section 2.4 focuses on emergence of geotourism mar-\n\nketing. Section 2.5 discusses geopark concepts, theories and paradigms and their targets. \n\nThe next section presents the comparison between geoparks and protected natural areas. \n\nSection 2.7 can provide a guideline for the proposed geoparks which want to become a \n\nGlobal Geoparks Member. And the eighth section discusses geo-products and branding in \n\ngeotourism destinations such as geoparks. In this section through introduction of geo-\n\nproducts in geoparks and various definitions of geo-products the author place emphasizes \n\non her definition for geo-products. \n\nSections 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 provide an overview of the effect of establishment of geoparks \n\non the local economy, cultural sustainability and socio-environmental sustainability. The \n\nlast sections are a review of innovative strategies in geoparks and the importance of  \n\nnetwork activity as an innovative approach for rural development.  \n\nChapter three discusses methodology and techniques applied in the research. Chapter \n\nfour, part one draws attention to geographical areas where the empirical study was con-\n\nducted. Innovative strategies, activities and geological characteristics of 29 geoparks that \n\nreplied to the questionnaires are explained in this chapter. Moreover, chapter four, part \n\ntwo consists of analysis and discussion of findings of the empirical study. This chapter  \n\nexplores the effect of establishment of geoparks on cultural, socio- environmental and  \n\nsocio-economical sustainability. \n\nChapter five deals with the characterization of the geographical area of the Qeshm Geo-\n\npark as a case study. Detail description of the geological, ecological and cultural heritage \n\nof the case study is also organized in this chapter. It is noteworthy that experiences \n\ngained from two previous chapters and thoroughness of the case study helped us to  \n\ndesign the SWOT matrices for Qeshm Geopark in section 5.1. 9. Furthermore, chapter \n\nfive, part two investigates the effect of establishment of Qeshm Geopark on cultural,  \n\nsocio- environmental and socio-economical sustainability.  Lastly, chapter six focuses on a \n\nconclusion, and strives to recommend some guidelines for aspiring geoparks and better \n\nmanagement of the case study. Moreover, chapter six introduces some future issues in \n\ngeopark research.   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2- Literature Review of \nConcepts related to Geopark and \n\nGeotourism \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n9 \n\n2.1.  Introduction \n\nThis chapter explains how the methodology of the literature review evolved. It provides an \n\noverview of sustainable tourism in order to identify principles and objectives of sustainable \n\ntourism; this chapter also describes the emergence of geotourism as a branch of sustain-\n\nable tourism to discover the relationship between geotourism and the local economy in \n\ngeoparks. Section 2.5 discusses the geopark concepts, theories and paradigms. The next \n\nsection presents the comparison between geoparks and protected natural areas. Section \n\n2.7 highlights guidelines and criteria for proposed and aspiring geoparks which want to \n\nbecome a GGN (Global Geoparks Network) Member. Section 2.8 introduces geo-products \n\nas an innovation in geoparks. The next three sections summarize the effect of the  \n\nestablishment of geoparks on cultural sustainability, socioeconomic and socio-\n\nenvironmental development in rural areas. Section 2.12 focuses on innovation in geoparks \n\nand section 2.13 indicates network activities as innovative approach in rural areas.  \n\n \n\n2.2.  Methodology for Literature Review \n\nThe first phase of this thesis consists of an extensive literature review of existing reports \n\non geotourism and geopark activities.  \n\nOpen Innovation (i.e. innovation inside and outside the firm\u2019s frontiers, with external part-\n\nnerships or outsourcing) is a recent topic in academic studies.  At the end of 2010, with a \n\nview to doing literature review, first, the author performed an in-depth review of Open  \n\nInnovation (OI) papers published in quoted scientific journals in the last ten years. The  \n\nauthor used as search parameters keywords such as geopark, geotourism, rural tourism, \n\nsustainable tourism, socioeconomic development, sociocultural development. She started \n\nby performing the literature review as follows:   \n\n\u2022 Individual search in scientific databases, e.g. Elsevier (Science Direct) and ISI Web \n\nof knowledge \n\n\u2022 Search on Google Scholar  \n\nResults for ISI Web of Knowledge (by end of 2010) obtained 33 papers for geoparks and \n\n21 papers for geotourism (Table 2.1).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n10 \n\nTable 2.1- Numbers of records in ISI Web of Knowledge for key words \n\nKey words \nRecords in ISI \n\nweb knowledge \n\nGeopark 33 \n\nGeopark AND \u201csocio economic\u201d 0 \n\nGeopark AND \u201csustainable tourism\u201d 3 \n\nGeopark AND \u201csocio cultural\u201d  2 \n\nGeopark AND \u201crural tourism\u201d  0 \n\nGeopark AND \u201crural development\u201d 0 \n\nGeopark AND \u201csustainable development\u201d 6 \n\nGeopark AND \u201clocal\u201d 5 \n\nGeotourism 21 \n\nGeotourism AND \u201csocio economic\u201d 1 \n\nGeotourism AND \u201csustainable tourism\u201d 0 \n\nGeotourism AND \u201csocio cultural\u201d 0 \n\nGeotourism AND \u201crural\u201d 1 \n\nGeotourism AND \u201clocal\u201d 4 \n\nGeotourism AND \u201csustainable development\u201d 3 \n\n \n\nMoreover, the author used the analysis function available in ISI Current Contents to per-\n\nform descriptive statistics on the papers. The results present information on years of pub-\n\nlications (Tables 2.2 and 2.3). The results indicated that the majority of the papers about \n\ngeoparks or geotourism were published in 2009.  \n\nThe results demonstrate that the topic is new and geoparks and geotourism are new  \n\nsubjects recently; so geopark activities have not been studied thoroughly yet.  \n\nFollowing web sites, publications, and centres (UNESCO Global Geopark Network, Euro-\n\npean Geopark Network, UNESCO, National Geography, Online library of  universities, the \n\nweb sites of geoparks, library of University of Aveiro, monthly newsletter of Naturtejo \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n11 \n\nGeopark, newsletter of Global Geoparks Network, on line journals, SGP (Small Grant \n\nProgramme) website, geoparks publications, IUGS (International Union of Geological  \n\nSciences), IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), IGU (International Geo-\n\ngraphical Union), Statistical Centre of Iran, Iran libraries and conferences proceeding) \n\nplayed an important role in contributing to the collection of information for this thesis. The \n\ngeopark and geotourism concepts are introduced below.   \n\n \n\nTable 2.2- Top publication year value for the keyword \u201cgeotourism\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.3- Top publication year value for the keyword \u201cgeopark\u201d  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n12 \n\n2.3.  Sustainable Tourism Concept   \n\nA rapid increase in per capita income and leisure time, and advances in technology have \n\nled to increased demands for recreation and holidays for a considerable number of people \n\nall over the world. Inevitably, such large-scale tourism activity has both positive and nega-\n\ntive consequences for the economy, environment, and the society of the host destinations. \n\nTherefore, tourism has been referred to as a \u2018revolution\u2019. On the positive side, tourism is \n\nconsidered a tool of economic regeneration, a means for heritage and environment  \n\npreservation and citizens\u2019 awareness, the creation of infrastructure and equipment, cul-\n\ntural communication, and political stability. On the other hand, since the tourism product is \n\nconsumed in the same place as its production, tourism development has come under  \n\ncriticism for various social and environmental strains experienced by host destinations and \n\npopulations, such as environmental degradation, cultural pollution, commercialization of \n\nhuman relations and negative demonstration effects (Andriotis, 2000). In this regard, the \n\nterm \u2018sustainable tourism\u2019 originated from the general concept of \u2018sustainable develop-\n\nment\u2019 which \u2018meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future \n\ngenerations to meet their own needs\u2019 introduced by Brundtland in 1987 (Beeton et al., \n\n2007).  \n\nSustainability as a general concept for tourism, as for other industries, has three intercon-\n\nnected aspects: environmental, sociocultural, and economic. Sustainability implies perma-\n\nnence, so sustainable tourism includes the optimum use of resources, including  \n\nbiological diversity, minimization of ecological, cultural, and social impacts, and maximiza-\n\ntion of benefits for the conservation of natural and cultural heritage and local communities. \n\nIt also refers to the management structures that are needed to achieve this.  \n\nFollowing the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the growing realization of the importance of a \n\nsustainable approach to tourism development, a number of international organizations  \n\nbegan efforts to develop principles to guide the development of sustainable tourism. In \n\n1995, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Educa-\n\ntional Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the European Union (EU) and the \n\nWorld Tourism Organization (UNWTO) organized a world conference on sustainable  \n\ntourism in Lanzarote, Canary Islands (Spain). The conference produced the first agree-\n\nment on how sustainable tourism should be developed. The Lanzarote Charter for  \n\nSustainable Tourism (1995) defined 18 principles, which in turn define how tourism should \n\nbe developed and it has been the basis for much work that has been done since then. The \n\n18 principles and objectives of the Declaration are as follows: (UNEP, 1995). \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n13 \n\n1. Tourism development shall be based on criteria of sustainability, which means it \n\nmust be ecologically bearable in the long term, economically viable, as well as \n\nethically and socially equitable for local communities. Sustainable development is \n\na guided process, which envisages global management of resources so as to  \n\nensure their viability, thus enabling our natural and cultural capital to be preserved. \n\nAs a powerful instrument of development, tourism can and should participate  \n\nactively in the sustainable development strategy. A requirement of sound man-\n\nagement of tourism is that the sustainability of the resources on which it depends \n\nmust be guaranteed. \n\n2. The sustainable nature of tourism should integrate the natural, cultural and human \n\nenvironment; it must respect the fragile balances in many tourist destinations, in \n\nparticular many small islands and environmentally sensitive areas. Tourism should  \n\nensure an acceptable evolution as regards the influence of the activity on natural \n\nresources, biodiversity and the capacity for assimilation of any impacts and  \n\nresidues produced. \n\n3. Tourism must consider its effects on the cultural heritage and traditional elements, \n\nactivities and dynamics of each local community. Recognition of the traditional \n\nelements and activities of each local community and support for its identity, culture \n\nand interests must at all times play a central role in the formulation of tourism \n\nstrategies, particularly in developing countries. \n\n4. The active contribution of tourism to sustainable development necessarily presup-\n\nposes the solidarity, mutual respect, and participation of all the actors implicated in \n\nthe process, especially those indigenous to the locality. Solidarity, mutual respect \n\nand participation must be based on efficient cooperation mechanisms at all levels: \n\nlocal, national, regional, and international. \n\n5. The conservation, protection, and appreciation of the worth of our natural and cul-\n\ntural resources afford a privileged area for cooperation. This approach implies that \n\nall those responsible must take upon themselves a true challenge, that of cultural \n\nand professional innovation, and must also undertake a major effort  \n\nto create integrated planning and management instruments. This approach must \n\nensure that all responsible actors have instruments of cooperation and manage-\n\nment integrated, including technological innovation. \n\n6. In consultation with interested and affected parties, the preservation of both the \n\nquality of the tourist destination, and the capacity to satisfy tourists should be  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n14 \n\ndetermined by local communities and should represent priority objectives in the \n\nformulation of tourism strategies and projects. \n\n7. To be compatible with sustainable development, tourism must be based on the  \n\ndiversity of opportunities offered by its local economy. It should be fully integrated \n\ninto and contribute positively to the local economic development. \n\n8. All options for tourism development must serve effectively to improve the quality of \n\nlife of all people and must entail a positive effect and inter-relation. \n\n9. Governments and authorities shall promote actions for integrating the planning of \n\ntourism with environmental NGOs and local communities to achieve sustainable \n\ndevelopment. \n\n10.  In recognition of the objective of economic and social cohesion among the people \n\nof the world as a fundamental principle of sustainable development, it is urgent that \n\nmeasures be developed to permit a more equitable distribution of the benefits and  \n\nburdens of tourism. This implies a change of consumption patterns and the intro-\n\nduction of ecologically honest pricing. Governments and multilateral organizations \n\nare called upon to abandon subsidies that have negative effects on the environ-\n\nment, and they are furthermore called upon to explore the application of interna-\n\ntionally harmonized economic instruments to ensure the sustainable use of all  \n\nresources. \n\n11. Environmentally and culturally vulnerable spaces, both now and in the future, shall \n\nbe given special priority in the matter of technical cooperation and financial aid for \n\nsustainable tourism development. Similarly, special treatment should be given to \n\nspaces that have been degraded by obsolete and high impact tourism models. \n\nTourism should be spread over a greater part of the calendar year. There is also a \n\nneed to explore further the usefulness of economic instruments at the  \n\nregional/local levels, with a view to ensuring the sustainable use of all resources. \n\nThe importance of legal instruments must be developed. \n\n12. The promotion of alternative forms of tourism compatible with the principles of sus-\n\ntainable development and the encouragement of diversification help guarantee \n\nmedium- and long-term sustainability. In this respect, there is a need, for many \n\nsmall islands and environmentally sensitive areas in particular, to actively pursue \n\nand strengthen regional cooperation. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n15 \n\n13. Governments, authorities, and NGOs with responsibility for tourism and the envi-\n\nronment shall promote and participate in the creation of open networks for informa-\n\ntion, research, dissemination, and transfer of appropriate tourism and environ-\n\nmental knowledge on tourism and environmentally sustainable technologies. \n\n14. There is a need to support and promote feasibility studies, vigorously applied  \n\nscientific field work, the implementation of tourism demonstration projects within \n\nthe framework of sustainable development, the development of programs in the \n\nfield of international cooperation, and the introduction of environmental manage-\n\nment systems. \n\n15. Authorities and associations with responsibility for tourism development, and envi-\n\nronmental NGOs shall draw up frameworks for sustainable tourism development \n\nand will establish programs to support the implementation of such practice. They \n\nshall monitor achievements, report on results, and exchange their experiences. \n\n16. Attention should be given to the role and environmental effects of transportation in \n\ntourism, and economic instruments should be developed and implemented in order \n\nto reduce the use of non-renewable energy. \n\n17. The adoption of, adherence to, and implementation of codes of conduct conducive \n\nin the context of sustainable development by the principal actors, particularly  \n\nindustry members, involved in tourism are fundamental for tourism to be sustain-\n\nable. Such codes constitute efficient instruments for the development of  \n\nresponsible tourist activities. \n\n18. All necessary measures should be implemented in order to sensitize and inform all \n\nthe parties involved in the tourism industry.  \n\nTo support the integration of sustainability into tourism policies, UNEP (United Nations \n\nEnvironment Programme) and the World Tourism Organization (WTO) conducted  \n\nresearch on approaches and tools for the development and implementation of sustainable \n\ntourism policies, which have shown them to be effective in practice. Sustainable tourism is \n\noften equated with nature tourism or ecotourism; but sustainable tourism development \n\nmeans more than protecting the natural environment. It means proper consideration of \n\nhost people, communities, cultures, customs, lifestyles, and social and economic systems. \n\nIt is tourism that enhances the material life of local communities, without causing a loss of \n\ntraditional employment systems, acculturation, or social disruption.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n16 \n\nDrost (1996) discussed how sustainable tourism development would entail the adoption of \n\nplanning strategies to mitigate the negative impact of tourism without sacrificing its bene-\n\nfits. He believes that educating and raising people\u2019s awareness of the physical and  \n\nsociocultural environment are fundamental for achieving sustainable development. It is \n\nnoteworthy that education is equally necessary for the host population and governments, \n\nand if it is to be effective, it should include periodic educational workshops and sharing of  \n\nexperiences and knowledge among countries regarding their respective approaches to \n\ncontrolling the negative impact of tourism. Sustainable tourism should not be regarded as \n\na rigid framework, but rather as an adaptive paradigm, which legitimizes a variety of  \n\napproaches according to specific circumstances.  \n\nMoreover, sustainable tourism is not achievable in the absence of strong local authority \n\nplanning and development control, and without the involvement of local communities in \n\nthe planning process (Hunter, 1997). Godfrey (1998) noted that to achieve sustainability, \n\nlocal government requires less emphasis on short-term economics, with greater recogni-\n\ntion of the social and environmental implications of the industry, and that local government \n\nshould support the integration of tourism interests within the context of all local socioeco-\n\nnomic development, rather than as a unique or isolated activity.     \n\nThe World Tourism Organization (1998) defined \u2018sustainable tourism\u2019, as the tourism  \n\ndevelopment that meets the needs of present tourists and host regions, while protecting \n\nand enhancing opportunities for the future leading to management of all resources, in \n\nsuch a way that economic, social, and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining \n\ncultural integrity, essential ecological processes, biological diversity, and life support  \n\nsystems (Byrd, 2007: 9). The evolution of the sustainable tourism concept is illustrated in \n\nFigure 2.1. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n17 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1- The evolution of the sustainable tourism concept  \n\n(Source: Hunter, 2006) \n\nIt must be mentioned that the appearance of a journal (Journal of Sustainable Tourism) \n\ndevoted to sustainable tourism topics is a sizeable body of literature which publishes the \n\nrecent definitions and state-of-the-art reviews related to sustainable tourism (Butler, 1999). \n\nMany authors and practitioners promote ecotourism, alternative tourism, responsible  \n\ntourism, soft tourism, low-impact tourism, community tourism, and so on, as the path to \n\nsustainable tourism development (Liu, 2003). Jafari\u2019s \u2018platform\u2019 model named 4 key  \n\nplatforms (advocacy, cautionary, adaptancy and knowledge-based) to provide a useful \n\nframework for understanding the emergence and development of sustainable tourism \n\n(Jafari, 1989; 2001). There are seven steps towards tourism sustainability: understanding \n\ncomplex adaptive systems; learning from natural ecosystems; co-evolution of human and \n\nnatural systems; extending tourism systems; integration; adding post-normal science; and \n\nfacilitating a transition (Farrell, 2005).   \n\nByrd (2007) argued for several indicators (stakeholder knowledge, perceived impacts of \n\ntourism development, support for tourism development, resident population demograph-\n\nics, attendance numbers at attractions, occupancy rate, host community attitudes toward \n\ntourism development, resident involvement in tourism development, local resident partici-\n\npation in planning, and availability of a resident advisory board) which can be used for \n\nstakeholder participation in a community. Governments must communicate with the local \n\npopulation and involve them in planning and management decisions while offering a fair \n\ndistribution of the benefits and cost among the full range of stakeholders (Yasarata et al., \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n18 \n\n2010). Local communities must be engaged in each stage of the development process: \n\nplanning, implementing and monitoring (Choi and Murray, 2010; Whitford and Ruhanen, \n\n2010).  \n\nIn addition, Liu (2003) noted that there are interrelationships between tourism, the envi-\n\nronment, and the local community. The traditional sustainable development paradigm  \n\ncontains economic, ecological, and sociocultural dimensions. The economic dimension \n\nsatisfies the primary needs of humans and implies that the economy supports employment \n\nand livelihoods on a competitive and stable macroeconomic scale. The ecological dimen-\n\nsion characterizes the need to utilize the environment within ecological limits. The  \n\nsocial-cultural dimension (i.e., individuals\u2019 skills, dedication, and experiences) meets indi-\n\nviduals\u2019 needs to live a dignified and healthy life.  \n\nThese three dimensions cannot be disassociated from a fourth institutional dimension that \n\nemphasizes participatory decision-making processes and public involvement (Figure 2.2). \n\nThis dimension refers to the level of public participation in political governance. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2- Prism of sustainability  \n\n(Source: Cottrell et al., 2007) \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n19 \n\nSuccessful sustainable tourism requires an integrated vision of policy, planning, and man-\n\nagement within the institutional context. Although the institutional component has received \n\nthe least attention of the three classic dimensions, Cottrell et al. (2007) have found that all \n\nfour dimensions contribute to attracting residents\u2019 satisfaction, with the institutional dimen-\n\nsion explaining the greatest percentage of variance for residents\u2019 satisfaction with tourism. \n\nMoreover, the participation of a community in local tourism stimulates locals through \n\narousing a feeling of belonging to that place and making them feel responsible for main-\n\ntaining their cultural heritage (Botelho da Costa and Nascimento, 2008). \n\nRecently, network activity as an innovation in sustainable tourism planning has been \n\nshown to bring certain benefits to all stakeholders. The experiences of Jennings and \n\nZandbergen (1995) illustrated that individual stakeholders contribute less to environmental \n\nsustainability than networks of agents. According to Bramwell and Sharman (1999) coop-\n\neration and collaboration are recognized as major aspects in tourism planning and are \n\nlinked to the idea of sustainable tourism development. Policy networks include two forms \n\n(vertical or horizontal). Agencies organized at the same level are classified into horizontal \n\nnetworks, while, relationships between different levels of government (local, regional, and \n\nnational) are formed in vertical networks (Hall, 1999). Networks of collaboration are key \n\ncomponents in environmental management (Robert and Simpsone, 1999). The experi-\n\nences of Dredge (2006) in Lake Macquarie (Australia) illustrated that in network activities, \n\nstakeholders can have membership of more than one network and stakeholder powers, \n\nroles, interactions and functions may become stronger. Moreover, collaboration in the \n\nform of a network creates opportunities for communication, for dialogue, for the develop-\n\nment of new ideas, and for the translation of ideas into practice. Erku?-\u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Eraydin \n\n(2010) noted that collaborative work in the form of networking and local collaboration in \n\nAntalya (Turkey) has provided more protection than individual organizations (Figure 2.3).   \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n20 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3- Governance networks observed in environmentally sustainable tourism  \n\n(Source: Erku?-\u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Eraydin, 2010: 115) \n\nEach type of network has strengths and weaknesses in promoting sustainable tourism. \n\nThe experiences of Beaumont and Dredge (2010) in Redland City Council (Australia) illus-\n\ntrated that different types of networks can be more or less effective in achieving good local \n\ntourism governance. \n\nRecently, the gap between local communities and tourists has decreased; many commu-\n\nnities in tourism destinations have organized themselves in defence of their cultural and \n\nnatural heritage. At the head of these, the EUROPARC Federation defined the European \n\nCharter for Sustainable Tourism in Protected Areas (1994). This charter provided an  \n\nopportunity for network activity, making new ideas, conservation of the environment and \n\nheritage, economic and social development, preservation and improvement of the quality \n\nof life of local residents and visitor management, and enhancement of the quality of  \n\ntourism offered (EUROPARC Federation, 2007). \n\nAccording to Woodley (1993:94), sustainable tourism in parks must primarily be defined in \n\nterms of sustainable ecosystems. Complexity of the protected area system (local-to-global \n\nimpacts), structure and forms of partnerships/collaboration, with particular focus on sus-\n\ntainability and stakeholders and the issue of representing nature in planning and negotia-\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n21 \n\ntion, are three aspects which are important for the development of tourism in protected \n\nareas (Jamal and Stronza, 2009). \n\nSubsequent to the European Charter, the European Geoparks Network (EGN) and the \n\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), through  \n\ncreating a worldwide network of geoparks, take advantage of networks of collaboration in  \n\nenvironmental management. The geopark as a new form of sustainable development and \n\nas a new model of protected area not only strives to popularize geological and geomor-\n\nphological heritage, but also stimulates local socioeconomic development through the  \n\npromotion of geotourism as a branch of sustainable tourism.  \n\nNowadays, geoparks as an innovation try to connect conservation, education, and geot-\n\nourism. Regarding this, a geopark, besides tourism marketing, can successfully perform \n\neducational tasks. There is a direct relation between geotourism and geoconservation; this \n\nrelation directly influences the popularization of geological knowledge, didactics and scien-\n\ntific studies in this domain, as well as recreation (Alexandrowicz, 2006). It is worth  \n\nmentioning that education on nature in geoparks, especially for schoolchildren, is very  \n\nimportant for the development of the supportive local and regional community in the  \n\nfuture.  \n\n \n\n2.4.  The Emergence of Geotourism  \n\nGeotourism, which was introduced publicly in 2002 by the Travel Industry Association of \n\nAmerica and National Geographic Traveller Magazine, incorporates sustainability princi-\n\nples (Alan, 2002). They introduced geotourism as tourism that sustains, or even  \n\nenhances, the geographical character of a place, such as its culture, environment,  \n\nheritage, and the well-being of its residents (Tourtellot, 2000: 2). \n\nIn 1997, National Geographic senior editor Jonathan B. Tourtellot and his wife, Sally  \n\nBensusen, coined the term geotourism in response to requests for a term and concept \n\nmore encompassing than ecotourism and sustainable tourism (Figure 2.4). Like ecotour-\n\nism, geotourism promotes a virtuous circle, whereby tourism revenues provide a local  \n\nincentive to protect what tourists are coming to see, but extends the principle beyond  \n\nnature and ecology to incorporate all characteristics that contribute to a sense of place, \n\nsuch as historic structures, traditional culture, landscapes, cuisine, arts and artistry, as \n\nwell as local flora and fauna. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.4- Geotourism model (Source: National Geographic, 2005) \n\n \n\nTherefore, geotourism manages to protect all aspects of a tourist destination such as: flora \n\nand fauna, history, archaeology, geology, traditional architecture, local music, cuisine,  \n\nlocal crafts, and arts (National Geographic, 2005 and 2009). \n\nTourtellot\u2019s definition of geotourism is not entirely original, but evolved from the previous \n\nconcept of sustainable development, sustainable tourism, and ecotourism. Geotourism \n\ndifferentiates itself from ecotourism through focusing on the geological and geomor-\n\nphological character of a region while many of ecotourism\u2019s definitions limit ecotourism to \n\nonly occurring in protected or natural areas and are mainly related to biodiversity.  \n\nSince geotourism is a niche market, it tends to be small and specialized; this market  \n\nincludes less impact, and interests visitors who seek a specific experience, activity and \n\nplace. Therefore geotourism is less likely to negatively impact the area (Gorman, 2007).   \n\nNational Geographic (2009) noted that geotourism adds to sustainability principles, its \n\n\"sense of place\", to emphasize the distinctiveness of its locale and benefit visitor and  \n\nresident alike:  \n\n\u2022 Geotourism is synergistic: all the elements of geographical character work  \ntogether to create a tourist experience that is richer than the sum of its parts,  \n\nappealing to visitors with diverse interests. \n\n \n\nSightseeing \n\nLocal \n\nCuisine Ecotourism \n\nNature \n\nCultural \n\nTourism \n\n \n\nIndigenous \n\nTourism\n\n \n\nHeritage \n\nTourism \n\nAgri  \n\nTourism \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n23 \n\n\u2022 It involves the community: local businesses and civic groups join to provide a \ndistinctive, authentic visitor experience. \n\n\u2022 It informs both visitors and hosts: residents discover their own heritage by \nlearning that things they take for granted may be interesting to outsiders. As local \n\npeople develop pride and skills in showing off their locale, tourists get more out of \n\ntheir visit. \n\n\u2022 It benefits residents economically: geotourism benefits travel businesses, local \nworkers, local services, products, and supplies. When community members under-\n\nstand the benefits of geotourism, they take responsibility for destination steward-\n\nship. \n\n\u2022 It supports integrity of place: destination-savvy travellers seek out businesses \n\nthat emphasize the character of the locale. In return, local stakeholders who  \n\nreceive economic benefits appreciate and protect the value of those assets. \n\n\u2022 It means great trips: enthusiastic visitors bring home new knowledge. Their  \nstories encourage friends and relatives to experience the same thing, which brings \n\ncontinuing business for the destination. \n\nThe first definition of geotourism as \u2018geological tourism\u2019 was published by Hose (1995, \n\n2000). According to S?omka and Kicinska- ?widerska (2004), in Poland geotourism is a \n\nbranch of cognitive tourism or adventure tourism which emphasize geological objects \n\n(geosites) and recognition of geological process. Some new terms in geotourism such as \n\ngeotouristic objects (geosites); geotouristic events; and geotouristic attractions were also \n\nintroduced (S?omka et al., 2006; S?omka and Mayer, 2010). Ryb\u00e1r (2006) recommended \n\ngeotourism with accent on mining tourism. He believes that mining tourism has positive \n\nsocial and economic impacts on the former and old European mining regions. Subse-\n\nquently, the first definition of geotourism was refined by Dowling and Newsome (2006), \n\nand Newsome and Dowling (2010).  \n\nHose (2008) noted that the term geotourism passed into general usage in the early 1990s, \n\nalthough its past history dates back to the seventeenth century. Its resource base includes \n\ngeosites, museums, library and archive collections and artistic outputs. \n\nAccording to Dowling and Newsome (2006) geotourism encompasses wider geographical, \n\nsocioeconomic and cultural contexts which sit under the umbrella of geographical tourism.  \n\nIt is evident that geographic tourism involves geotourism as a target of geoparks (Figure \n\n2.5). It is worth mentioning that the conceptualization of geotourism was improved in the \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n24 \n\nbook titled: \u201cGeotourism: sustainability, impacts and management\u201d (Dowling and \n\nNewsome, 2006). In this book geotourism was conceptualized into a three-sided box: geo-\n\nlogical form, process, and tourism. Moreover, geotourism involves visits to geosites for the \n\npurpose of recreation, engaging a sense of wonder and learning. \n\nAfter that, Newsome and Dowling (2010) discussed the relation between geotourism and \n\nother forms of tourism. Figure 2.6 illustrates a particularly strong relationship between \n\necotourism and geotourism (dotted and thick line). This definition, like the National Geo-\n\ngraphic definition, includes ecotourism and cultural tourism, but the emphasis of Newsome \n\nand Dowling\u2019s (2010) definition is on geology.  \n\nA list of different geotourism definitions is presented in Table 2.4. The lack of a common \n\nunifying definition for geotourism signifies only that geotourism is an interdisciplinary \n\nknowledge still at the very beginning.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - The existing spectrum of geotourism (Source: Dowling and Newsome, 2006) \n\n \n\nGeoparks \n\n \n\nGeotourism \n\nGeographic Tourism \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 - The relationship of geotourism with other forms of tourism \n\n(Source: Newsome and Dowling, 2010) \n\n \n\nTable 2.4 - Definitions of geotourism from 2000 \n\nGeotourism is \u201ctourism that sustains, or even enhances, the geographical character of a place, \nsuch as its culture, environment, heritage, and the wellbeing of its residents. The concept was in-\ntroduced publicly in a 2002 report by the Travel Industry Association of America and National Geo-\ngraphic Traveler magazine (Tourtellot, 2000: 2). \n\nGeotourism is an emerging niche market within sustainable tourism and is centered on sustaining \nand enhancing the geographical character of a place (Stokes et al., 2003:1). \n\nGeotourism may constitute a segment of ecotourism, which is \u201ca sustainable form of natural re-\nsource-based tourism that focuses primarily on experiencing and learning about nature, and which \nis ethically managed to be low-impact, non-consumptive, and locally oriented (control, benefits and \nscale). It typically occurs in natural areas, and should contribute to the conservation or preservation \nof such areas (Fennell 2003: 32). \n\nGeotourism is not a new definition, but simply a way of combining developing concepts of sustain-\nability accounting with developing concepts of tourism market segmentation (Buckley, 2003: 76-\n82).   \n\nGeotourism will be identified as a branch of geology, important for the development of the national \neconomy (Hose, 2000; S?omka, and Kici?ska-?widerska, 2004). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n26 \n\nTable 2.4 - Definitions of geotourism from 2000 (cont.) \n\nGeotourism is a multi-interest kind of tourism exploiting natural sites and landscapes containing \ninteresting earth-science features in a didactic and entertaining way (Pralong, 2006:20-25). \n\nAccording to Frey 1998, geotourism means interdisciplinary cooperation within an economic, suc-\ncess-oriented and fast-moving discipline that speaks its own language (Frey et al., 2006: 97). \n\nGeotourism is a new occupational and business sector. The main tasks of geotourism are the \ntransfer and communication of geo-scientific knowledge and ideas to the general public (Frey et al., \n2006: 97). \n\nGeotourism is sustainable tourism with a primary focus on experiencing the Earth\u2019s geological fea-\ntures in a way that fosters environmental and cultural understanding, appreciation and conserva-\ntion, and is locally beneficial (Dowling and Newsome, 2006: 3-25). \n\nGeotourism comprises the geological elements of \u2018form and process\u2019 combined with the compo-\nnents of tourism such as attractions, accommodation, tours, activities, interpretation and planning \nand management (James and Hose, 2008: 199-208). \n\nIn 2008, the Travel Industry Association declared that Geotourism celebrates sense of place while \nsupporting principals of conservation related to a destination\u2019s natural resources, culture, heritage \nand traditions. It incorporates travel sectors such as lodging, shopping, entertainment, dining, and \ntouring when they provide and promote authentic experiences distinctive to the character of the \nlocale, and do so in a way that benefits the local community (Miller and Washington, 2009: 170-\n172). \n\nGeotourism is a form of natural area tourism that specifically focuses on geology and landscape. It \npromotes tourism to geosites and the conservation of geodiversity and an understanding of Earth \nsciences through appreciation and learning. This is achieved through independent visits to geologi-\ncal features, use of geo-trails and view points, guided tours, geo-activities and patronage of geosite \nvisitor centres (Newsome and Dowling, 2010: 4-5). \n\n \n\nThis study employs the last four definitions of geotourism to discover the innovative \n\nstrategies and novel trends in travel to geoparks and rural development. \n\nAside from geoparks, which are under the umbrella of UNESCO, National Geographic \n\nalso introduces some geotourism destinations around the world. In July 2008, five U.S. \n\ngovernment agencies joined the National Geographic Society to formally adopt the princi-\n\nples of geotourism (Moffet and Moody, 2008). In December 2005, the states of Arizona in \n\nthe United States and Sonora, Mexico, signed a National Geographic Geotourism Charter \n\nin order to promote sustainable tourism and destination stewardship in the Sonoran  \n\nDesert region. This project included preparing a Geotourism map guide and an associated \n\nwebsite for two geotourism products that encompassed both cultural and environmental \n\nconcerns in order to introduce the natural phenomena to tourists. This was the fourth \n\nGeotourism Charter issued worldwide and the first transnational effort undertaken by the \n\nNational Geographic Society. In The First Transnational Geotourism Project, they decided \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n27 \n\nto establish a Geotourism Council. The Council would lead a bi-national grassroots effort \n\nto develop a regional map guide, promote the tenets of geotourism, and encourage desti-\n\nnation stewardship in the region (Murrieta et al., 2005). \n\nNational Geographic\u2019s ambition is to protect distinctive travel regions of the world through \n\na type of tourism that focuses on destination stewardship. Their tools for preserving these \n\nregions are geotourism map guides. These geotourism map guides are a hybrid cross  \n\nbetween guidebooks and road maps. Instead of reading a guidebook and map separately, \n\nthe map guides spatially represent the unique tourism destinations of a region by overlay-\n\ning destination information on top of a relief map of the region. These maps  \n\nprovide tourists with information on historic sites, cultural sites, accommodation, hikes, \n\nand many other types of information, allowing the tourist an opportunity to experience \n\nwhat makes the region special (Boley, 2009). Bosak et al. (2010) noted that geotourism \n\nmap guides, such as the Crown of the Continent, constitute a useful tool to promote a \n\nmore responsible form of tourism and allow visitors to have easier access to the distinctive \n\nfeatures of the region. \n\nOther existing charters include Norway, Honduras, Romania, the Cook Islands, Califor-\n\nnia's Redwood Coast, Portugal's Douro Valley, Montreal, Greater Yellowstone, Baja Cali-\n\nfornia, Sierra Nevada, and Guatemala (Claude Joly, 2009; Dion et al., 2009;  \n\nNational Geographic, 2010; Sejvar et al., 2010). Honduras was the first country to make \n\ngeotourism its national tourism strategy (National Geographic, 2005). \n\nNowadays, the Center for Sustainable Destinations (CSD) seeks to help individual places \n\nto use the geotourism approach to improve stewardship and attract the most beneficial \n\nand least disruptive forms of tourism. Regarding this, CSD works with a community-based  \n\nlocal geotourism alliance to create a co-branded National Geographic map (geotourism \n\nmap guides) that highlights the natural, historical, and cultural assets unique to a destina-\n\ntion. Until 2010, CSD prepared the geotourism map guides for the North California Coast, \n\nCentral Cascades, Montreal, Arizona/Sonora, Baja California, Crown of the Continent, \n\nGreater Yellowstone, Guatemala, Peru and Vermont.  \n\nMoreover, CSD launched geotourism projects in Romania, Norway, Rhode Island and \n\nHonduras to introduce geotourism opportunities in these territories.  \n\nBrozinski (2009) discussed the main difference between Popularization of Geology (PoG) \n\nand geotourism. Basically, the data in PoG and geotourism is the same, but PoG only \n\ngoes as far as educating people about geology, while geotourism has an effect on the  \n\nlocal economy.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n28 \n\nBoley (2009) suggested a Geotourism Survey Instrument (GSI) to study the presence of \n\ngeotravellers\u2019 behaviour in geotourism destinations such as the Crown of the Continent \n\nregion of Montana, United States of America, and Canada. He focused on four measured \n\ndimensions of geotourism (culture-heritage, environment, aesthetics, and well-being of \n\nlocals). It is worth mentioning that these dimensions were derived from the introduction to \n\ngeotourism by National Geographic. A six-point scale was used to evaluate the geotravel-\n\nlers\u2019 behaviour in these territories. In this survey the mean scores ranged from 5.4 to 4.2, \n\nindicating a high agreement with the overall values of geotourism.  \n\nNickerson (2010) used quantitative research methods for the study of tourist behaviour in \n\nMontana as a geotourism destination in the United States of America, to introduce geot-\n\nourism as a basis for infrastructure planning in this territory. \n\nIn addition, Boyle and Nickerson (2010) used the Geotourism Survey Instrument (GSI) \n\nmethod in order to study demographics, geotraveller scores, and travel behaviour  \n\ncomparisons. Moreover, this study aimed to identify the important attributes for geotravel-\n\nlers, segmenting the geotravellers, and travel expenditures for geotravellers in Montana. \n\n284 questionnaire forms filled in by vacation visitors were collected from 40 survey sites. \n\nOn the basis of the results of this research, daily expenditures for the three distinct groups \n\n\u2013strong geotraveller, moderate geotraveller and non-geotraveller \u2013 are differentiated. \n\nStrong geotravellers spent an average of 141.79 dollars more per day while the moderate \n\ngeotraveller spent almost 134.10 dollars per day, and the non-geotraveler spent 109.15 \n\ndollars.  \n\nThe geotourism definition by National Geographic and several studies related to this defi-\n\nnition demonstrate the difference between the National Geographic Society definition and \n\nthat of geoparks. The definition adopted by the National Geographic Society is now under \n\ndiscussion by the European Geoparks Network. In a geopark, geotourism must have a \n\nstrong emphasis on geological heritage.  \n\nThe following definition (Newsome and Dowling, 2010) is the most recent definition of \n\ngeotourism which includes the wider aspects of tourist activity: \u201cGeotourism is a form of \n\nnatural area tourism that specifically focuses on geology and landscape. It promotes tour-\n\nism to geosites and the conservation of geodiversity and an understanding of earth  \n\nsciences through appreciation and learning. This is achieved through independent visits to \n\ngeological features, use of geo-trails and view points, guided tours, geo-activities and  \n\npatronage of geosite visitor centres\u201d. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n29 \n\nAccording to Carvalho and Rodrigues (2010a), geotourism is not just organizing tourism in \n\ngeoparks (Figure 2.7); it involves seven elements that must be always in close connection \n\nin a geopark, such as geological heritage, other heritage, tourist facilities, education,  \n\ninterpretation, geoconservation and local development, for tourism diversification of the \n\nterritory.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7- Geotourism-related elements for tourism diversification \n\n(Source: Carvalho and Rodrigues, 2010a) \n\n \n\nGray (2008) believes that one of the most popular geotourism locations in the world is the \n\nGrand Canyon. The Grand Canyon applies to the diversity of the strata in the walls of the \n\ncanyon in terms of rock colours and resistance to erosion, and the diversity of the slope \n\nmorphologies and processes, besides the comprehensive geological history of the last \n\n2000 million years that is enclosed in the rocks and landscape. Besides, many sports and \n\nleisure pursuits such as rock climbing also depend on geodiversity in this area.   \n\nHeggie (2009) pointed out that volcano tourism and travel to geothermal destinations are \n\nprominently under the umbrella of geotourism. In 2008, 2.3 million tourists visited the  \n\nactive volcanic features in the Hawaii, 4.2 million visited the geysers and hot springs of \n\nYellowstone National Park and National Park in Arkansas, and 415,000  \n\nvisited Oregon\u2019s Crater Lake National Park. The geothermal and volcanic activity at  \n\nRotorua, New Zealand, Mount Etna in Italy, Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji, Mount Tungurahua in  \n\nEcuador, Villarrica Volcano in Chile, the volcanic island of Sicily, like Stromboli, and  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n30 \n\nIceland\u2019s active volcanoes are other popular destinations for volcano tourists. In addition,  \n\nlocal houses for rent to tourists in the Azores, \u201cVolcano watching\u201d for tourists visiting  \n\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park, Teide Volcanoes National Park and tourists visiting \n\nMammoth Mountain, a dormant volcano and popular recreation destination in the United \n\nStates, are further names in geotourism marketing. \n\nFurthermore, Erfurt-Cooper and Cooper (2010) introduced volcano geothermal systems \n\nas sustainable geo-resources for leisure and recreation. They noted that active lava flows, \n\nStrombolian eruptions, geysers and hot springs, lava lakes, crater lakes, boiling ponds, \n\nfumaroles and vents, boiling mud pools, hot rivers and streams, and sinter terraces are \n\nten top attractions in volcanic and geothermal destinations.  \n\nThus, geological heritage sites can generate employment and new economic activities, \n\nespecially in rural regions in need of new or additional sources of income (El Wartiti et al., \n\n2009). In this regard, geological landscapes that draw visitors to Ireland and Britain  \n\nsupport a thriving tourist industry. For instance, the Dinosaur Coast Project has marketed \n\ngeology directly to tourists (McKeever et al., 2006). Moreover, Ireland ran a project sup-\n\nported by the local authorities, the Geological Survey of Ireland, the Geological Survey of \n\nNorthern Ireland, and the University of Ulster, to discover the role of geotourism in sup-\n\nporting regeneration in disadvantaged rural communities in Ireland (O'Connor, 2008). \n\nTourism marketing in the Lake Constance region, which is situated in Germany, Switzer-\n\nland, and Austria near the Alps, is in need of innovation to fulfil the increasing demand of \n\ntourists and consumers or customers in the long run. To this end, they have  \n\nintroduced geotourism as a successful marketing policy for developing the Lake  \n\nConstance area (Gerner et al., 2009). \n\nThe development of the European Geoparks Network and the UNESCO Geoparks  \n\nProgram are providing models for engaging the public in the appreciation of geology that \n\nlinks sustainable economic development with the preservation and interpretation of geol-\n\nogy (Miller, 2008). The geopark concept has been developed in recent years with the  \n\nintention of promoting economic development through geotourism based on the geological  \n\nresources of the territory (Gray, 2004, 2008). Fassoulas and Zouros (2010) noted that  \n\ngeoparks especially act for the benefit of local communities through the development of \n\ngeotourism and educational activities in rural areas.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n31 \n\n2.5.  Geoparks: Concepts, Theories and Paradigms \n\nPatzak and Eder (1998: 33-34) argued for the definition of a geopark as a territory com-\n\nprising a number of protected geological heritage sites of special geological significance, \n\nrarity or beauty. These geological features are representative of a region and its geologi-\n\ncal history, events and processes. Comparable to a natural park, a geopark falls under the \n\nauthority of the government in the country where it is situated. Geoparks are of particular \n\nvalue for education, science, culture and socioeconomic development (mainly through \n\ntourism). According to the EGN and UNESCO\u2019s recommendations, the criteria for the  \n\ndevelopment of a geopark include (UNESCO, 2006b):   \n\n\u2022 Size and setting: a geopark candidate seeking network membership must have \nenough surface area in order to serve local economic and cultural development \n\n(mainly through tourism), including sites of ecological, archaeological, historical or \n\ncultural value. \n\n\u2022 Management and local involvement: success in geopark management can only \nbe achieved through strong local involvement. The initiative to create a geopark \n\nmust come from local communities/authorities with a strong commitment to de-\n\nvelop and implement a management plan that meets the economic needs of the \n\nlocal population, whilst protecting the (geological) landscape in which they live. \n\n\u2022 Economic development: one of the main strategic objectives of a geopark is to \nstimulate economic activity and sustainable development. A geopark seeking \n\nUNESCO's assistance serves to foster socioeconomic development that is cultur-\n\nally and environmentally sustainable. This has a direct impact on the area involved \n\nby improving human living conditions and the rural environment. \n\n\u2022 Education: a geopark must provide and organize support, tools and activities to \n\ncommunicate geo-scientific knowledge and environmental concepts to the public; \n\nall educational activities should reflect the ethical considerations around holistic \n\nenvironmental protection. \n\n\u2022 Protection and conservation: a geopark contributes to the conservation of  \nsignificant geological features. \n\n\u2022 Global Network: The Global Network of National Geoparks provides a platform of \ncooperation and exchange between experts and practitioners in geological  \n\nheritage matters. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n32 \n\nThe aforementioned criteria indicate that geoparks have three main targets: conservation, \n\neducation and promoting local economy through geotourism. In order to achieve these \n\ngoals, geoparks try to take advantage of network activities, the knowledge and workforce \n\nof locals. \n\nJones (2008) argued that the philosophy behind the geopark concept was first introduced \n\nat the Digne Convention in 1991.  \n\nThe planned name \u201creserve\u201d was changed to \u201cgeopark\u201d based on the Decision of Earth \n\nSciences of UNESCO in 1997. After that, the European Geoparks Network was estab-\n\nlished in 2000 as an international LEADER Program activity (Zouros and Martini, 2003). \n\nThe European Geopark Network was set up by four regions of different European Coun-\n\ntries \u2014 France, Germany, Spain and Greece \u2014 with similar natural and socioeconomic \n\ncharacteristics. These four regions are rural areas, with a particular geological heritage, \n\nnatural beauty, and high cultural potential, all facing problems of slow economic develop-\n\nment, unemployment, and a high level of emigration. Faced with these problems, the \n\nmanaging authorities of the geological parks and museums in these regions decided to \n\nstrengthen their collaboration, and as a result the European Geoparks Network was estab-\n\nlished, although UNESCO gave no financial backing to the four countries (Zouros, 2004; \n\nZouros, and Mckeever, 2009). \n\nThe main characteristic of the European Geoparks Network is that it works as a network of \n\ncollaborating areas, rather than a list of members, as in UNESCO Programs. The network \n\noperates primarily by continuous electronic communication, frequent coordination meet-\n\nings, and the establishment of common promotion tools and projects through which territo-\n\nries can exchange ideas, experiences, and best practices, thereby supporting each other \n\nto fulfil their common goals. \n\nIn 2001, the European Geoparks Network signed a formal agreement with the UNESCO \n\nDivision of Earth Sciences whereby UNESCO gave the network its endorsement. During \n\nThe First International Conference of Geoparks in Beijing (China, 27-29 June 2004), held \n\nby UNESCO, two main streams of activities were combined, and the UNESCO-assisted \n\nGlobal Geoparks Network was set up (EGN, 2007). The aim of this network is to provide a \n\nplatform of cooperation and exchange between experts and practitioners in geological \n\nheritage matters under the umbrella of UNESCO. \n\nThe objective of the World Heritage Convention is to recognize natural and cultural sites of \n\n\"outstanding universal value\u201d (Eder and Patzak, 2004). The geopark as a \u201cGeological heri-\n\ntage scenic spot of special geoscientific significance, rare natural attributes and aestheti-\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n33 \n\ncally ornamental value and with given scale and distribution scope, which integrates other \n\nnatural scenes and sights and that of cultural interest into a unique natural area. It is not \n\nonly a site for travel and sightseeing, vacationing and health recuperation as well as  \n\ncultural recreation at a relatively high scientific level, but also a key protected area of geo-\n\nlogical heritage and base for geoscientific research and popularization\u201d (Chen and Jiang, \n\n2003). A geopark contains a number of geological heritage sites of particular importance, \n\nrarity, or aesthetic appeal. These earth heritage sites are part of an integrated concept of \n\nprotection, education, and sustainable development. A geopark achieves its goals through \n\na three-pronged approach: conservation, education, and geotourism (UNESCO, 2006a). \n\nUNESCO introduced the geopark as a geographical area, but geoparks should include not \n\nonly sites of geological significance, but also sites of ecological, archaeological, historical, \n\nor cultural value. In many societies, natural, cultural, and social heritage are inextricably \n\nlinked and, thus, cannot be separated (UNESCO, 2007).  \n\nIn 2004, the agreement between the UNESCO Division of Earth Sciences and the EGN \n\nwas confirmed by the Madonie Declaration (Italy, October 2004). A presentation of the \n\ndeclaration is necessary as it uses European geoparks as a model for the rest of the con-\n\ntinental networks to develop and form the GGN supported by UNESCO (UNESCO, 2006a; \n\nFrey et al., 2006). Aside from EGN and GGN, there is also IAGT (the International Asso-\n\nciation for Geotourism) established in Krakow, Poland in 2007, in order to facilitate infor-\n\nmation exchange, business, research and teaching partnerships and other collaborative \n\nactivities among its members (http://www.iageotour.com/; Newsome et al., 2011). \n\nUNESCO supports national geoparks which are potential candidates for incorporation into \n\nthe gradually expanding world network (Alexandrowicz, 2006). Since the establishment of \n\nthe European Geoparks Network the protection of geological heritage and the promotion \n\nof sustainable development have been the main objectives of each geopark (EGN, 2007). \n\nThe UNESCO geopark list shows that the numbers of geoparks are increasing very fast \n\n(Table 2.5 and Figure 2.8). At the end of 2011, there were 87 geoparks in 27 countries, \n\nwhich had been registered with the GGN, and China with 26 geoparks is the world\u2019s  \n\nleading country (Newsome et al., 2012).  \n\nNowadays, at the European level, the LEADER and INTERREG IV projects support initia-\n\ntives in the field of the development of geotourism, particularly within geoparks. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n34 \n\nFor exchange of knowledge, the Global Geoparks Network held international conferences \n\nwith geopark and geotourism themes. The First International Geoparks Conference took \n\nplace in June 2004 in Beijing with over 300 people from 40 countries. The Second Global \n\nGeoparks Conference was held in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in September 2006, with 320 \n\nparticipants from 40 countries and 6 continents. The Third Global Geoparks Conference \n\nwas in Osnabruck (Germany) in June 2008, with around 500 participants from 60 coun-\n\ntries. The 4th International UNESCO Conference on Geoparks was held in Southeast \n\nAsia, Langkawi Global Geopark (Malaysia) in 2010. The conference was attended by 427 \n\npeople from 27 countries, with the biggest contingent from China. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 - Geoparks registered in GGN from 2004 to 2011  \n(updated by http://www.earthwords.fsnet.co.uk/geopark.htm) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n35 \n\nTable 2.5- Registered geoparks in GGN  \n\n(Source: www.unesco.org/science/earth/doc/geopark/list.pdf) \n\n \n\nThe idea of a geopark is originally closely related to the pedagogical, tourism, and geo-\n\nlogical scientific interest of sites (Figure 2.9). However, the term \u201cGEO\u201d is more than  \n\ngeology; it involves geographical (both physical and human) and geomorphological earth \n\nsystems. \n\nCountry name / year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 \n\nAustralia 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 \n\nAustria 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nBrazil 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nChina 8 12 18 18 20 22 24 26 \n\nCroatia 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 \nCzech Republic 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nFrance 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 \n\nGermany 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 \n\nGreece 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 \n\nIran 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nIreland 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 \n\nItaly 1 2 2 3 5 5 7 8 \n\nMalaysia 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 \nNorway 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 \n\nPortugal 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 \n\nRomania 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nSpain 1 1 4 4 4 4 5 7 \n\nUnited Kingdom 2 4 4 6 6 8 8 8 \n\nJapan 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 5 \n\nHungary-Slovakia 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 \n\n    Canada 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 \n\n    Korea 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 \n\n    Vietnam 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 \n\n    Finland 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 \n\nGermany-Poland 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \nIceland  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \n\nEuropean Geoparks 12 20 25 29 31 35 42 49 \n\nTotal Number of   \nGeoparks \n\n20 32 45 50 55 64 77 87 \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9- Relation between geopark and geography (Source: IGU, 2008) \n\nWith regard to this, at the end of 2007, the International Geographical Union Executive \n\nCommittee decided to launch the Commission on geoparks and continue the work of the \n\ngeopark task force. \n\nThe commission took two years (2008\u20132009) to develop its research programs and estab-\n\nlish a methodological framework to analyse issues of geoparks, including relationships \n\nwith associated institutions and International Geographical Union (IGU) Commissions; \n\nfrom 2010 to 2012 it is focusing on the development of comparative studies on geoparks, \n\ntourism, and corresponding social, economic, environmental, and political change (IGU, \n\n2008). \n\nThe general goal of geoparks is to integrate the preservation of geological heritage into a \n\nstrategy for regional sustainable economic and cultural development (Eder, 2008). There-\n\nfore, geoparks stimulate the creation of innovative local enterprises \u2013 small business,  \n\ncottage industries, and new jobs \u2013 and generate new sources of revenue stemming from \n\ngeotourism and geo-products. When geotourists move to geoparks, the money follows the \n\nsame path, as if geoparks were exporting something such as agricultural and local prod-\n\nucts to other places. Geoparks have to support the establishment of local crafts and repli-\n\ncas, as well as supporting local products. Thus, visitors to geoparks can actually take \n\naway with them, together with emotions and knowledge, manufactured goods (Frey, et al. \n\n2006). \n\nGeotourism has created opportunities for new initiatives in Forest Fawr Geopark (Wales). \n\nForest Fawr opened the door of geoparks to geotourism activities such as walking,  \n\ncycling, introducing courses on geology, organizing research projects and exhibitions, and \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n37 \n\nproviding educational packages for schools, to attract more lucrative European funding for \n\nthe geopark territory (Penn, 2006). Furthermore, Partin et al. (2006) illustrated that the \n\npark managers of the Stone Forest Geopark (China) reported that the villagers in areas \n\nbordering the park and those involved in tourism have three times the income of other  \n\nregional villagers. The quality of housing in villages adjacent to the park was notably \n\nhigher than that in villages where tourism did not constitute a large proportion of the local \n\neconomy. Moreover, national geoparks in China brought favourable social, cultural, eco-\n\nnomical and environmental benefits (Xun and Ting, 2003). Another example in this regard \n\nis the Jinhu National Geopark in Taining County, Fujian Province (China) established in \n\n2000. The related tourism projects attract a great number of visitors. In 2001, the total \n\nrevenues from tourism reached 202 million Yuan, 35.7% over the previous year, account-\n\ning for 13.5% of the county\u2019s GDP (Xun and Ting 2003). Revenues from tourism-related \n\ntertiary industry increased to 450 million Yuan, up 12.3% compared with the previous year \n\nand accounting for nearly 30% of the county\u2019s GDP. Thus, tourism has become a pillar \n\nindustry of the county. It has brought such trades as catering, transportation and cultural \n\nrecreation, providing employment for about 2,800 people (Xun and Ting, 2003).  \n\nFurthermore, in collaboration with nine agro-tourist women\u2019s cooperatives, the Museum of \n\nLesvos Petrified Forest European Geopark (Greece) has established an agro-tourist festi-\n\nval during the summer period in order to promote the quality of local products, food and \n\ndrinks prepared using old recipes by the women of the villages in the geopark area \n\n(Zouros, 2004).   \n\nMcKeever et al. (2010: 225) described the creation of the Petrified Forest of Lesvos Euro-\n\npean Geopark as having transformed western Lesvos, attracting 90,000 visitors annually \n\nand employing 35 directly and hundreds of new jobs having been created indirectly. The \n\ngeopark is now the island\u2019s main visitor attraction and is an excellent example of how the \n\nholistic approach to conservation used in geoparks can be successful from the perspec-\n\ntive of the local community. \n\nSince the geopark is a new concept, geopark activities have not been deeply studied yet. \n\nBased on the literature review, Fang et al. (2007) analysed and discussed the spatial hier-\n\narchy structure and system conception model of geoparks, and classified geopark infor-\n\nmation systems into subsystems, such as geological relic survey and appraisal subsys-\n\ntem, geological relic protection, tourism exploitation, science popularization and teaching, \n\ngeopark planning, geological environment, multimedia, map editing subsystem, and so on. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n38 \n\nWith the rapid development of geoparks and e-tourism,  the internet plays a significant \n\nrole in promoting and distributing geopark services. Regarding this, Yan et al. (2008)  \n\nexamined the performance of the e-business system of geoparks in China and  \n\nprovided a comprehensive assessment of e-business functions of geoparks in China. \n\n \n\n2.6.  Comparison between Geoparks and Protected Natural Areas \n \nFarsani et al., (2011a) discussed the comparison between geoparks and protected natural \n\nareas.  \n\nThe concept of protected area dates back to 1872 when the first modern protected area \n\n(Yellowstone National Park) was established in the USA. This accompanied the formal \n\nlaws which forced indigenous Indians to leave their territory. This management structure \n\nof protected areas was followed by many countries (Langton et al., 2005).  \n\nIt is noteworthy that attention to the rights of local communities in management of pro-\n\ntected areas is relatively recent. In the 19th and 20th centuries, many protected areas \n\nwere established on land and resources held as common property by communities, but \n\nperceived as terra nullius (no man\u2019s land) when it came to seeking permission and offering \n\ncompensation. The resident people were often expelled or severely restricted in terms of \n\npermissible uses of natural resources, often without compensation. Today, few people  \n\nargue against the need to engage resident or neighbouring communities positively in the \n\nmanagement of protected areas, and probably no one would defend the proposition that \n\nhuman rights are less important in relation to protected areas than elsewhere. Moreover, \n\naround the world, conservation agencies and communities are also \u201clearning by doing\u201d in \n\nan enormous variety of specific situations, trying to understand and apply an evolving \n\nbody of international and national laws and regulations on the rights of indigenous people \n\nand local communities. The specific concerns about the rights of indigenous people have \n\nemerged as part of this evolving body of human rights. Thus the ILO Convention No. 169 \n\nConcerning Indigenous and Tribal People in Independent Countries, adopted in 1989  \n\ndefines indigenous people and recognizes their right to have their social, cultural, reli-\n\ngious, and spiritual values and practices recognized and protected, and the right to define \n\ntheir development priorities (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2004). According to Agenda 21, the \n\nknowledge and traditional way of life of the local, rural communities play a vital role in  \n\nenvironmental management. States are encouraged to support the identity and culture of \n\ncommunities and to enable their effective participation in the achievement of sustainable \n\ndevelopment (Brecon Beacons National Park Authority, 2007). \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n39 \n\nAt present, UNESCO\u2019s declaration on geoparks as a model of sustainable development \n\nand protection of nature has highly developed the strategy of local communities\u2019 participa-\n\ntion in protected and natural areas. The UNESCO definition demonstrates that geoparks \n\nembrace some registered National Parks and protected areas with unique geological and \n\ncultural heritage sites. For instance, Cabo de Gata Natural Park (Spain) had been a  \n\nprotected area since 1987 and classified by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve, when in \n\n2006 it was accepted as a member of the European and Global Geoparks Network (EGN). \n\nNowlan (2010) noted that a geopark is not a new form of land ownership. The designation \n\nof the land area as a geopark does not affect the legal status of a property and the federal, \n\nprovincial, territorial, municipal and first nation laws remain applicable to ownership and \n\nmanagement of the sites. UNESCO has no legal rights over local, provincial, territorial, \n\nfederal, aboriginal, or private ownership or management of geopark territory. On the other \n\nhand all geoparks are under the umbrella of UNESCO which supports and internationally \n\nunifies the Global Geoparks Network (GGN); for example UNESCO organizes and coordi-\n\nnates the conferences, and supervises application procedures and standards, and  \n\nproduces publications on geoparks and geotourism topics.  \n\nThe natural heritage and monuments which include the criteria of UNESCO can be  \n\napplied to Global Geoparks Network membership (Table 2.6).  \n\nIt is stated that a geopark should aim for the development of the local territory and support \n\nlocal communities and products. Local communities should not be removed from the lands \n\nwhere they live, since the locals\u2019 knowledge, traditional arts and traditional style of life can \n\nplay a vital role in geopark management. Geoparks are established at an international \n\nlevel but are managed at a local level; a geopark encourages the local communities to fol-\n\nlow cultural interchange and identity preservation. It also motivates local people to effec-\n\ntively participate in achieving sustainable development and sustainable tourism. Moreover, \n\na geopark leads to the stimulation of the local economy through geotourism and conserva-\n\ntion activities. Sustainable socioeconomic development is encouraged in geoparks and is \n\nconsidered in the way the park is developed (Nowlan et al., 2004). Managers of geoparks \n\ntry to improve the welfare of indigenous communities through innovative activities and \n\nconsulting with local businesses, artists, tour operators, private sectors, accommodation \n\nfacilities, restaurants, and producers. Besides this, they involve locals in conservation and \n\neducational activities and imparting of indigenous knowledge and art. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n40 \n\nTable 2.6 - Parks and protected area may be included within geopark\u2019s boundaries \n\nClassification of protected area \n\nNational Parks Natural Park Nature  reserved \n\nProvincial Park \nMunicipal or Regional \n\nlands/Parks \n\nProtected landscapes \n\n \n\nTerritorial Parks Aboriginal lands Site of biological interest \n\nReserved area Natural monuments \nTrails (geological, ecological and cul-\n\ntural) \n\nProtected areas \nProvincial, territorial, local, and \n\nprivate conservation land \nPrivate lands that offer public access \n\n \n\nTransferring geoparks from the regional to a European and Global scale gives the \n\ngeopark a special value (Frey et al., 2006). \n\nThe Global Network of National Geoparks operates in close synergy with UNESCO\u2019s \n\nWorld Heritage Centre, the Man and the Biosphere (MAB), World Network of Biosphere \n\nReserves, national and international undertakings and non-governmental organizations \n\nactive in geological heritage conservation. For some national geoparks in Europe, a  \n\nprivileged partnership has been established with the European Geoparks Network.  \n\nNational parks have been defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature \n\n(IUCN), and World Commission on Protected Areas.  \n\nMcKeever and Zouros (2010) discussed that the structure of the European Geoparks \n\nNetwork comprises an Advisory Committee (11 members including representatives of \n\nUNESCO, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), and the IUCN) and a \n\nCoordination Committee (comprising two representatives from each geopark member). \n\nDecisions concerning the network are only taken by the Coordination Committee. \n\nHowever, some countries, such as China, Germany and Japan, have developed national \n\ngeopark networks to create close collaboration between geoparks, NGOs (non-\n\ngovernmental organizations), tourism sectors, schools, universities, and businesses. \n\nThus, the domestic network or forum not only provides an opportunity for the exchange of \n\nknowledge but also encourages local communities and local private sectors in geopark \n\nactivities. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n41 \n\nIt can be said that the geopark is a fully-fledged protected area that, on the one hand,  \n\ninvolves local communities in conservation activities of natural heritage and takes advan-\n\ntage of their indigenous knowledge and, on the other hand, strives to improve the local \n\neconomy through geotourism. The core difference is actually that in a protected natural \n\narea in most countries and, at least in certain zones, no human and/or development activi-\n\nties are allowed to take place due to a very strict protection status.  \n\nAnother difference between geoparks and protected areas is that geoparks are commonly \n\ncreated and managed by local communities while protected areas are usually part of  \n\nnational organizations of natural heritage conservation. The last but not the least differ-\n\nence between geoparks and protected natural areas is the emphasis of the geopark on \n\ngeological heritage and its introduction as tourist attractions in addition to ecological, cul-\n\ntural, historical, and archaeological aspects. \n\n \n\n2.7.  Steps and Guidelines for Becoming a Global Geopark Network Member \n\nAccording to UNESCO Global Geoparks Network Guidelines (2010), size and setting is \n\nthe first criterion for becoming a geopark. A geopark should include an area with clearly \n\ndefined boundaries and a large enough area for it to develop the local economy and cul-\n\ntural sustainability, particularly through tourism in the form of geotourism. Usually, geopark \n\nterritory encompasses geosites and eco-sites with international, national and regional  \n\nimportance.  \n\nSince education and public awareness is a target of geopark establishment, the geosites \n\nand eco-sites located in the geopark should be important from the point of view of science, \n\nrarity, education and aesthetics.  \n\nA geopark involves ecological, archaeological, historical and cultural values. Both tangible \n\nand non-tangible heritage are important parameters for the establishment of geoparks. \n\nSpiritual culture includes components such as: languages, food, music, dance, traditional \n\npractices and ways of living, etc., and these are examples of non-tangible heritage.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that a geopark may be situated in the territory of more than one country. \n\nNovohrad-Nogad Geopark \u2013 a member of European Geoparks Network and Global  \n\nGeoparks Network \u2013 is located in the territory of two countries (Hungary and Slovakia). \n\nThe second criterion for becoming a geopark is contribution in management and local  \n\ninvolvement. Establishment of an effective management system and program of imple-\n\nmentation is a prerequisite for geopark creation. It is evident that geosites and eco-sites \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n42 \n\nshould be accessible to visitors and should provide tourists with satisfaction. Moreover, for \n\nbetter management of the geopark, the authorities should involve local communities, the \n\nprivate sector and both researchers and educational bodies in the design and running of \n\nthe geopark. Thus a geopark must encourage partnerships in its territory.   \n\nDevelopment of the local economy is the third criterion for becoming a geopark. The main \n\nobjective of a geopark is to stimulate the local economy within the framework of sustain-\n\nable development. Stimulating the local economy through tourism marketing is an  \n\nimportant goal of a geopark. Examples can include: wine tours related to geology, soil, \n\nand topography; historic mining operations (even active mines) \u2013 such as the Geological \n\nand Mining Park of Sardinia (Italy) \u2013 or sightseeing and photography tours. Regardless of \n\nthe development of the local economy, a geopark should play an important role in  \n\nsociocultural sustainability; often cultural heritage is linked to geological heritage through \n\ninnovative strategies in geoparks. Making geo-products \u2013 local products which are sym-\n\nbols and communication disclosers of geoheritage \u2013 constitute a good example.     \n\nIn many cases, local communities have a special cultural connection to specific features in \n\nthe landscape of the geopark. One remarkable example is the architecture of the houses \n\nin the Monsanto village in Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) integrated between granite boul-\n\nders which are the symbol of this secular culture.  \n\nThe creation of innovative local enterprises, such as opening geo-bakeries and geo-\n\nrestaurants, small businesses, cottage industries, the organization of high quality training \n\ncourses, and the appearance of new job opportunities and new sources of revenue  \n\nthrough geotourism, geo-products and geoconservation (encouraging casting instead of \n\nthe sale of fossils, for example) are benefits which emerge through the establishment of \n\ngeoparks. These activities can provide supplementary incomes for local communities and \n\ncan engage locals in geotourism marketing as a new business sector involving strong  \n\nmultidisciplinary cooperation. \n\nThe fourth criterion for becoming a geopark is organizing educational activities. A geopark \n\nshould transfer knowledge and information within the community. Regarding this, it must \n\nprovide and support tools and activities to communicate geo-scientific knowledge and  \n\nenvironmental and cultural concepts to the public (e.g. through geopark museums, theme \n\nmuseums, geotourist maps, interpretative panels, educational centres, geo and cultural \n\ntrails, guided geotours, and modern communication media). A geopark should run educa-\n\ntional programs for universities and schools. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n43 \n\nProtection and conservation activity is another criterion for becoming a geopark: it should \n\ntry to explore and demonstrate methods and best practice in conservation of geological \n\nheritage. Likewise, a geopark must not participate in the direct sale of rocks and geologi-\n\ncal objects (Nowlan, 2010). A geopark not only preserves natural heritage but also strives \n\nto preserve the cultural heritage; holding regional festivals and organizing exhibitions for \n\nlocal products and handicrafts are strategies for reviving traditional culture.  \n\nFinally, if a geopark has the above-mentioned criteria, and a fully operational and dedi-\n\ncated body, it can apply for membership of the Global Geoparks Network. The steps for \n\nregistration in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network are summarized in Figure 2.10.  \n\nIn the first step, the geopark authorities should submit an application dossier of the  \n\nproposed geopark to the Geoparks Secretariat at UNESCO; the application should be \n\nsubmitted electronically.  \n\nAfter that, the Geoparks Secretariat shall verify the documents. Applications must be \n\nsubmitted between 1 October and 1 December every year and they will be verified  \n\nbetween 1 January and 30 April. Subsequently, in order to carry out the evaluation,  \n\nexperts who will compile a report for submission to the GGN Bureau contact the proposed \n\ngeopark and agree on a mission program. According to Global Geoparks Network guide-\n\nlines, the costs of travel, accommodation and transportation of the experts should nor-\n\nmally be paid for by the country or territory where the geopark is located. \n\nObviously, if there is a National Network or Forum for geoparks in a country such as \n\nChina, Japan, Germany, Italy, Ireland or Greece, the applicant must first become a certi-\n\nfied member of that national network, or ask for advice, before submitting its dossier for \n\nmembership to the GGN. Similarly, European geoparks should first become a member of \n\nthe European Geoparks Network.  \n\nWhen a geopark is registered in the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network, membership is \n\nlimited to a period of 4 years, after which time it can be renewed following the same pro-\n\ncedure. The authorities should fill in the revalidation form and a visit by two evaluators will \n\nbe organized.  \n\nAfter revalidation one of three results will be announced. A Green Card certifies continuing \n\nmembership of the geopark in the network for a further 4 years. A Yellow Card will be  \n\nissued if the geopark activities and documents are not sufficient, and if the geopark is  \n\ninactive it will be removed from the Network and a Red Card will be issued (Zouros and \n\nMckeever, 2009). Any geopark that loses Global Geoparks Network membership can \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n44 \n\nsubmit a new application dossier after solving the major deficiencies that led to the Red \n\nCard. \n\nClearly, The UNESCO Global Geoparks Network (GGN) members can take advantage of \n\nGGN Logo and exchange of knowledge in Network activity.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n               \n\nFigure 2.10 - Steps for registration a geopark in Global Geoparks Network  \n\n(Source: own construction) \n\n \n\n2.8.  Geo-products in Geotourism Destinations such as Geoparks \n\nMiddleton (1989) stated that the tourism product includes all the service elements a visitor \n\nconsumes from the time that he leaves home to the time of return. This product can be an \n\nidea, an expectation, or a mental construct in the customer's mind, at the point of sale. \n\nMiddleton (1989) believes that the concept of a tourist product is relevant both to destina-\n\ntion interests, such as National Tourist Offices and Regional Tourist Offices, and to the \n\nsuppliers of individual component services, such as accommodation and attractions. \n\nWith the emergence of geotourism as a new branch of sustainable tourism, tourism prod-\n\nucts have entered a new phase. Since geotourism is a new niche market, on one hand, it \n\nshould introduce its attractions and its targets to visitors and on the other hand it should \n\nset up novel strategies to meet the challenge of attracting more tourists to geotourism  \n\n \n             Addressing Selection Criteria  \n\n- Size and Setting  \n- Contribution in management and local involvement  \n- Development of local economy \n- Educational activities \n- Protection and conservation activities  \n\nSubmitting an application dossier of proposed Geopark to              \nUNESCO Global Geoparks Network \n\n            Verifying the documents and evaluating the proposed  \nGeopark by experts of UNESCO  \n\n              Announcing results by UNESCO Global Geoparks \nNetwork  \n\n1\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4\n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n45 \n\ndestinations. In this regard geotourism destinations such as geoparks strive to apply inno-\n\nvation in tourist products.  \n\nThese tourist products should not only follow sustainability principles, but should also \n\npromote and develop geotourism as a new branch of tourism.  \n\nAs geosites (geological and geomorphological heritage sites) are the main attractions of \n\ngeotourism destinations (such as geoparks), demonstration of pedagogical tools for geot-\n\nourism and educational activities can be a strategy for the preservation of geoheritage \n\nsites and minimizing negative impacts of tourism on these sites.  \n\nAccording to Reynard (2008), geotourism offer or geotourism products/services can be \n\nclassified into two categories: original offer and derived offer (Figure 2.11). The original \n\noffer consists of the set of geosites (e.g., an occurrence of dinosaur tracks, paleontological \n\nsites, landforms, mineral water springs etc.), while the equipment developed for the  \n\naccommodation and transportation of tourists, the specific derived scientific goods (books \n\nand other written documents, digital documents, games and souvenirs) that facilitate the \n\ncomprehension of the geoheritage by the tourists, the interpretation services at the  \n\ndisposal of tourists in the area (museums, visitor centers, exhibitions, guided tours,  \n\ninterpretative panels), as well as outside the region (websites) are categorized as derived \n\ngeotourism offer or products/services. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n46 \n\nFigure 2.11- Conceptual model of geotourism and its relationships with geo-heritage  \n\n(Source: Pralong and Reynard, 2005) \n\nThis section focuses on the introduction of derived geotourism products named geo-\n\nproducts. According to UNESCO (1999), geo-products are \u201cthe sustainable manufacturing \n\nof innovative handicrafts which have a geological connotation\u201d. Geo-products are new  \n\norientations in trades and crafts (Xun and Milly, 2002). Eder and Patzak (2004) introduced \n\ngeotourism and geo-products as new sources of revenue which can provide supplemen-\n\ntary income for the local population and attract private capital. Frey et al. (2006) noted that \n\ngeo-products are pedagogical tools for environmental education, training, and interdisci-\n\nplinary research related to geoscientific disciplines, broader environmental issues, and \n\nsustainable development. According to UNESCO Global Geoparks Network Guidelines \n\n(2010) geo-products are tools for protecting the geo-resources of the geopark (e.g.  \n\nencouraging locals to make casts of the fossils instead of selling them). Geo-products try \n\nto integrate traditional products with new concepts and interpretations; they also raise \n\nawareness of geodiversity. Geo-products provide new experiences for geotourists and \n\nstrive to develop the local economy (Rodrigues and Carvalho, 2009). Comp?ov\u00e1 (2010) \n\nidentified geo-products as geological attractions such as geosites, geoheritage, etc. He \n\nindicated that geo-products can involve human products related to the cultural patterns \n\nand architecture of the geotourism destinations. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n47 \n\nMaking geo-products can be a solution to promote the local economy and local products \n\nin geotourism destinations, especially geopark territories (Farsani et al., 2011a).  \n\nThe above definitions illustrate that each geotourism destination, when making geo-\n\nproducts should pay particular attention to the following principles (Farsani et al., 2012a):  \n\n\u2022 geo-products should be made of local or regional products; \n\n\u2022 geo-products should be a symbol of the geological or geomorphological heritage of \n\nthat territory; \n\n\u2022 geo-products should be commercial and pedagogical tools; \n\n\u2022 geo-products should integrate local and traditional products with concepts and in-\n\nterpretations in geosciences;   \n\n\u2022 geo-products should be earth friendly (sustainable) products;  \n\nMaking geo-products is an innovative strategy, and has been applied by some geoparks, \n\nfamily businesses, restaurants, bakeries, and local businesses for education and devel-\n\nopment of the local economy through geotourism. \n\nThe Junior Geo company can be seen as a good example for making geo-products.  \n\nJunior Geo is a family-run business based in Dorset (UK), which was set up in August \n\n2005. The Junior Geo company tries to organize field trips (fossil hunting trips on the SW \n\nCoast of England) for schoolchildren, as well as working hard on combining the wonders \n\nof the natural world and modern design to create something that looks really fabulous. The \n\nJunior Geo company created the Rock Shop for school fairs in 2005, and established an \n\nonline store that provides all things fossil and mineral for kids (Verkaik et al., 2005).  \n\nCustomers can buy online milk chocolate ammonites, milk chocolate trilobites, chocolate \n\ndinosaur shapes, chocolate fossil shells, etc. \n\nAs mentioned before, geoparks are pioneers in the promotion of geotourism, and authori-\n\nties of geoparks through consulting with local businesspeople, restaurants, bakeries,  \n\nmuseums, outdoor companies, rural hotels, and family guest houses attempt to develop \n\ngeo-products in these territories. It is worth mentioning that geo-products which are made \n\nbased on geological elements of geoparks not only introduce local products and local \n\nhandicrafts to visitors, but increase public awareness and knowledge of visitors about the \n\ngeology and geomorphology of that territory. Therefore it can be said that geo-products \n\nare pedagogic tools in geoparks.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n48 \n\nApart from the above, there are geotourism maps, geotours, geo-museums, thematic  \n\nmuseums, interpretative panels, publications, geotourism handbooks, geotourism guide \n\nbooks, and geotourism calendars. Geoparks applied innovation in decorative or ornamen-\n\ntal products, and edible products for introducing geoheritage sites. Therefore, geo-\n\nproducts in geoparks can be classified into two categories: decorative or ornamental geo-\n\nproducts, and edible geo-products.  \n\nDecorative, ornamental and commemorative goods made from stone or wood, furniture, \n\nchildren's toys, and clothes which are symbols of the geopark can be a geo-product. In \n\ngeopark territory local handicrafts can be converted to decorative or ornamental geo-\n\nproducts. These kinds of geo-products can not only preserve handicrafts as a cultural \n\ncomponent and develop the local economy, but also present the geological heritage of the \n\ngeopark to visitors, local communities, and children including schoolchildren. \n\nMaking trilobite clocks, trilobite lamp shades, printed glass with trilobite pictures, trilobite \n\nnecklaces, etc. in Arouca Geopark (Portugal) can be a good example of decorative or  \n\nornamental geo-products (Farsani et al., 2012a). It is noteworthy that one of the most  \n\nimportant geosites in Arouca Geopark is an outstanding fossil locality of the Darriwilian \n\n(Middle Ordovician) age, where giant trilobites and trilobite clusters (from several to thou-\n\nsands of specimens) occur in large slabs of shale (GTGA, 2006; Coelho, et al., 2010). \n\nPedras Parideiras is another geo-product in the Arouca Geopark. Pedras Parideiras are \n\ncookies which have the shape of biotite nodules from local granites. Visitors can find these \n\ncookies in one of the famous pastry shops of Arouca (Casa do P\u00e3o de L\u00f3 de Arouca). \n\nPedras Parideiras is a symbol of the Castanheira Nodular Granite, with a phenomenon \n\npopularly known as Pedras Parideiras (rocks that give birth) (Farsani et al., 2012a).   \n\nNaturtejo Geopark (Portugal) is another active geopark in making geo-products. The  \n\nestablishment of a geo-restaurant and geo-bakery in Naturtejo Geopark were strategies to \n\ncreate geo-products. They draw inspiration from the landscape and have revived past  \n\ncivilizations and ancient traditions as well (Rodrigues and Carvalho 2009; Naturtejo \n\nGeopark Authorities, 2010a)  \n\nThe geo-bakery (Casa do Forno) is managed by a geologist couple. Geology stimulates \n\nthe couple participating in management; for instance they make trilobite and granulite \n\ncookies in the geo-bakery, and they serve them in tours, conferences, and for the local \n\nguests.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n49 \n\nBesides this, the geo-bakery has designed a geo-menu and serves geo-food. Each pizza \n\nin this restaurant has a geographic name, for example Nazca Pizza (an example of a  \n\ntectonic earth plate). Aside from tectonic pizza, the geo-bakery makes Orogenic Toasties \n\n(Cadomian, Variscan and Alpine, representing the major mountain belt events from \n\nNaturtejo Geopark) (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009). \n\nServing \u2018Boulder Soup\u2019 or \u2018Marble Cake\u2019 in the Petiscos &amp; Granitos geo-restaurant which \n\nis located in the Monsanto village, Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) constitutes another good \n\nexample for making geo-products. Petiscos &amp; Granitos is the first geological restaurant \n\nwhich is located in the Naturtejo Geopark territory. The food is served on tables set among \n\nboulders (the geological architecture of the restaurant) (Rodrigues and Carvalho 2009; \n\nFarsani et al, 2010).  \n\nFurthermore, Carlos Santos, a businessman from Idanha-a-Nova has inaugurated the \n\nsecond geo-restaurant in Naturtejo Geopark. The Carlos Santos Sabores da Terra (Earth \n\nFlavours) geo-restaurant serves traditional recipes combined with local products such as \n\nlocal mushrooms, cheese and olive oil. In addition, geo-food such as Cantchais Lamb \n\n(Cantchais is the local name for granite boulders) is served in this geo-restaurant. The \n\nmenu of the restaurant is related to local geological landscapes (Naturtejo Geopark  \n\nAuthorities, 2010a).  \n\nVulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) became economically famous for its mineral water  \n\nresources. Today, many volcanologists and geologists as well as environmental scientists \n\nand biologists do research here because of the large open pits which give a new dimen-\n\nsion to look into volcanological processes and perspectives for sustainable development \n\nideas. Creating geo-cocktails such as Vulkaneifel Mineral Water Cocktails is an innovation \n\nfor promoting regional and local products in this geopark (Farsani et al., 2010).  \n\nAs for geology, Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania) is known worldwide for its \n\n\"dwarf dinosaurs\" from the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, and this special \n\npaleontological heritage has inspired the name of the geopark. The authorities of this  \n\ngeopark, through making geo-products such as dinosaur bread, promote geosciences as \n\nwell as the local economy (Farsani et al., 2012a).  \n\nFurthermore, R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute Provence (France) offers ammonite choco-\n\nlate, ammonite bread, and pastries, as some of the attractions in Digne les Bains (Unjah, \n\n2008).  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n50 \n\nConsequently, it can be said that geo-products as pedagogic tools are sustainable and \n\nearth friendly products which can integrate geoheritage (geological, geomorphological and \n\ngeographical) with cultural components. Thus, making geo-products is an innovative strat-\n\negy to identify geoheritage as a new tourist attraction. Promoting geo-products can be a \n\nway to develop the local economy (Farsani et al., 2012a; 2011b)  \n\nIt should be noted that a geopark is an area for introducing and protecting the geological \n\nand geomorphological heritage, such as its cultural, ecological, archaeological and natural \n\nresources, as tourist attractions; the establishment of a geopark can be a strategy for  \n\nsustainable economical development. Therefore, marketing in geoparks should not only \n\npay particular care and attention to geo-products and geotourism marketing, but also help \n\nto draw attention to local marketing such as local products, agricultural products, handi-\n\ncrafts based on natural heritage (fauna and flora), regional festivals, national festivals,  \n\ncultural festivals, etc.   \n\nAs mentioned before, local companies, bakeries, restaurants, outdoor companies, and \n\nfamily businesses are active in creating geo-products.    \n\nIt is noteworthy that the private sector or family businesses only undertake innovation \n\nsuch as creating new products when an organization promises them to be profitable.  \n\nBranding (certification) of local products will support the local producer. Local producers \n\nand customers will benefit from branding advantages which are higher-quality, environ-\n\nmentally friendly and so on.  \n\nRegarding this, the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network provides opportunities and possi-\n\nbilities, through a common logo, for small firms which are the members of the Geopark \n\nNetwork to boost their creativity and initiatives (Zouros and Mckeever, 2009). These logos \n\nmust only be used on products produced directly by geoparks and related to geopark  \n\nactivities (such as geo-products, publications, fairs, regional festivals, exhibitions, etc.). \n\n \n\n2.9.  Socio-Cultural Sustainability in Geoparks \n\nThe New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy (Hirsch et al., 2005) defines culture as \u201cthe sum of \n\nattitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another. Cul-\n\nture is transmitted through language, material objects, ritual, institutions, and art, from one \n\ngeneration to the next\u201d (Hirsch et al., 2005). According to Barbic (1998), cultural identity \n\nand its components are changing over time even though, when these components are \n\nknown as traditions, it persists for a longer time.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n51 \n\nCultural identity is classified into two groups: material culture and spiritual culture. Accord-\n\ning to Le Ha (2008) material culture is always changing, while spiritual culture is more  \n\nstable. Spiritual culture includes components such as languages, handicrafts, food, music, \n\ndance, etc., and material culture involves landscapes such as architecture and urbanism, \n\ncrops, etc. (Figure 2.12).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.12 - Cultural identities (Source: Barbic, 1998) \n\n \n\nThe aim of this section is to identify the role played by geoparks and geotourism in cultural \n\nsustainability. For this purpose, a brief literature review addresses the negative and posi-\n\ntive impacts of tourists on the sociocultural identity of host communities. Furthermore, a \n\nliterature review was conducted to find out which activities are applied by geoparks in or-\n\nder to preserve cultural components of local communities who live in geopark territories.    \n\nDiscussion of tourism\u2019s social and cultural impacts on host communities was presented in \n\nAmerica with the publication of Hosts and Guests in 1977 (Smith, 1989a). Running \n\nthroughout the book is the theme that tourism has consequences for the host society, \n\nsometimes good and sometimes bad. \n\nMansperger (1995) found that tourism in Kenya has encouraged undesirable behaviours \n\namong residents such as begging and prostitution. Importantly, he noted that this behav-\n\niour is reduced in communities with strong native institutions. Brunt and Courtney (1999)  \n\noffered an excellent review of this literature. The literature mentioned identified the key \n\nsocial impacts of tourism development, such as: the concentration of power among elites; \n\nthe loss of local decision-making power; the erosion of gender segregation and  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n52 \n\nincreased opportunities for women; and a shift in demographics bringing young transients \n\nlooking for jobs, dependency, and over-crowding. They also found that the key social im-\n\npacts of tourist-host interaction have been identified as: changes in perceived safety and \n\nsecurity; a worsening attitude towards tourists; the imitation of perceived tourist lifestyles; \n\nintroduction of new languages; the demise of local languages; conflict; avoidance of tourist \n\nareas, resentment due to economic inequality; and resentment over inflated prices.   \n\nLastly, it was found that the key cultural impacts of tourism are: commoditization of  \n\nculture; revitalization of culture; acculturation; destruction of culture; and temporary \n\nchange in host behaviour. These impacts are quite varied and reported from studies all \n\nover the world.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that sustainable tourism tries to decrease the negative impacts of \n\ntourism. Smith\u2019s (1989b) study of Eskimo tourism in Alaska illustrated that the tourists  \n\ndiscovered Northern Alaska and Eskimo culture vanished.     \n\nSimilarly, McKean (1989) suggested that tourism in Bali, Indonesia, is conserving tradi-\n\ntional culture, while simultaneously contributing to its inevitable change. By commoditizing \n\nfolk dances and crafts, tourism has provided an incentive for their conservation and  \n\nappreciation. Meanwhile, Bali culture is becoming modernized, partly as a result of new \n\nideas and technologies introduced by tourism. \n\nTo this end, tourists should be informed about local customs, dress codes, acceptable  \n\nsocial behaviours, etc. By means of advertisement visitors can be educated through intro-\n\nducing local cultural values, providing cultural guidelines, and presenting briefings about  \n\nappropriate behaviour. \n\nAs McKercher (2003) noted, cultural sustainability increases people's control over their \n\nlives and strengthens community identity; it is also compatible with the locals\u2019 culture and \n\nvalues. The following guidelines are principals for cultural sustainability planning and \n\nmanagement:  \n\n\u2022 Initiate tourism with the help of broad-based community input;  \n\n\u2022 Support educational and training programs to improve and manage heritage and \n\nnatural resources; \n\n\u2022 Conserve cultural diversity; \n\n\u2022 Respect land and property rights of traditional inhabitants; \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n53 \n\n\u2022 Guarantee the protection of nature, the local and indigenous cultures and  \n\nespecially traditional knowledge; \n\n\u2022 Work actively with indigenous leaders and minority groups to ensure that indige-\n\nnous cultures and communities are depicted accurately and with respect; \n\n\u2022 Strengthen, nurture, and encourage the community's ability to maintain and use \n\ntraditional skills; \n\n\u2022 Educate tourists about desirable and acceptable behaviour; \n\n\u2022 Educate the tourism industry about desirable and acceptable behaviour; \n\n Duxbury et al. (2007) indicated ten key themes of cultural sustainability: the culture of \n\nsustainability; globalization; heritage conservation; sense of place; indigenous knowledge \n\nand traditional practices; community cultural development; arts, education, and youth; sus-\n\ntainable design; planning; and cultural policy and local government. \n\nFurthermore, Eraqi (2007) claims that tourism development in Egypt has not only contrib-\n\nuted to economic benefits in terms of job creation and has not only increased investment \n\nand development of projects to local Egyptian tourist destinations, but has also resulted in \n\nsociocultural benefits such as an increase in national income, more positive cultural  \n\nexchange, and has yielded positive economic impacts on local businesses. Soini and \n\nKangas (2009) also argued for the promotion of cultural sustainability in rural areas, as \n\ncommunities preserve their cultural identities more than in urban areas. Tourism strategy \n\nshould concentrate on activities that help improve the skills of local people, create positive \n\nattitudes towards work, and encourage investment in the state\u2019s infrastructure such as \n\nmedia, fairs, regional festivals, cultural museums, etc. It is necessary to facilitate direct \n\ncontact between tourists and local people by encouraging rural families to invite tourists \n\ninto their homes. \n\nAccording to National Geographic\u2019s definition \u201cGeotourism is tourism that sustains, or \n\neven enhances, the geographical character of a place, such as its culture, environment, \n\nheritage, and the well-being of its residents\u201d. Geotourism should strive for cultural sustain-\n\nability and sustainable development (Figure 2.13).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13- Geo-heritage\u2019s contribution to sustainable development and geotourism  \n\n(Source: Rodrigues, 2009)      \n\nAndr??anu and Grigorescu (2008) argued that any geopark territory is not a sum of sepa-\n\nrate elements, but rather an organic context of spatial and non-spatial realities, shaped by \n\nits physical structure (geodiversity and biodiversity), human landscape and its historic  \n\nevolution. The major role of the geopark is to help local communities to re-appropriate \n\nthese values and to revive and strengthen the local and cultural identity in respect to sus-\n\ntainable development principles. Regarding this they suggested four basic ideas for  \n\napproaching geopark development: \n\n\u2022 Developing interdisciplinary detailed research studies to identify the territorial  \n\nsystem components, their relationships, social and economical needs and assign a \n\nrole and relative priority for each one related to local identity valorization; \n\n\u2022 Use of the research results and multi-stakeholder approach to develop social, eco-\n\nnomic and cultural projects and to support active participation and involvement of \n\nlocal communities; \n\n\u2022 Creating local, national and international partnerships for formal and informal edu-\n\ncation, public awareness, project development and to promote the area and its \n\nvalues; \n\n\u2022 That due attention be given to activities from projects dealing with public aware-\n\nness, cultural events, promotion, informal education, the potential of cultural goods \n\nfor local or regional development, and the needs and the willingness of the local \n\ncommunity concerned.   \n\nGeodiversity \n\nGeo- heritage  \n\nCultural heritage  \n\nLandscape  \n\nGeosites  \n\nMaterial \n\nImmaterial \n\nOther local or  \n\nregional resources \n\nGeotourism \n\nOther local or  \n\nregional resources \n\nS\nustainable developm\n\nent \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n55 \n\nRecently, geoparks \u2013 through promoting geotourism in their territory \u2013 strive to achieve \n\nkey themes of cultural sustainability and revive traditional culture while decreasing the \n\nnegative cultural impacts of tourism. \n\nFor sociocultural sustainable development, geoparks hold workshops, festivals, fairs, and \n\neducational programs. Moreover, geoparks, through innovative strategies, try to introduce \n\nthe traditional skills of locals to tourists. In this regard, Langkawi Global Geopark (Malay-\n\nsia) exposed Malay herbal treatments and ancient health rituals to tourists. A geopark \n\nsong sung in the local language is one strategy to prevent the demise of the local  \n\nlanguage in the area (Azman et al., 2010). Presenting local handicrafts, souvenirs, local \n\nproducts, and organizing exhibitions, fairs, festivals, and workshops together with the es-\n\ntablishment of cultural museums can be not only a solution for local economic rehabilita-\n\ntion, but can also recover the traditional style of life and local customs. \n\nFor instance, in the Stone Forest National Geopark located in southwest China\u2019s Yunnan \n\nProvince, visitors can observe the folk customs and local culture while enjoying the beauty \n\nof science and Karst landscapes (Xun and Milly, 2002). Geologically, Tower Hill is an in-\n\nternational site of significance and the main site for Australia\u2019s first Global Geopark, Ka-\n\nnawinka. Tower Hill, by balancing modern artwork, nature-based cultural tourism, envi-\n\nronmental management and bush-food enterprises with traditional aboriginal knowledge, \n\nhas revitalized culture and strengthened sustainability objectives (Collyer, 2007).  \n\nOrganizing regional festivals, fairs and exhibitions is the first strategy which geopark  \n\nauthorities apply to cultural sustainability. Regarding this, the Mongols in Hexigten Global \n\nGeopark (China) hold a grassland Nadam fair during the summer and autumn to celebrate \n\ntheir harvest (Tingshan, 2004); it is worth mentioning that the Nadam fair is a historic festi-\n\nval in this territory which the geopark has tried to revive.  \n\nOrganizing a project regarding making homemade maize bread in Arouca Geopark,  \n\nPortugal, which was attended by 120 people, mostly women, was a strategy to revive the \n\ntraditional gastronomy in this territory. This project was an important opportunity to involve \n\nlocal communities with Arouca Geopark and to promote knowledge about geosites, espe-\n\ncially the maize bread rocks geosite and cultural sustainability (Sousa et al., 2011).   \n\nIn order to attract people to visit the Lesvos Petrified Forest European Geopark (Greece), \n\nthe local governors organize several scientific and cultural events during the year. These \n\ninclude natural history exhibitions, lectures, book presentations, exhibitions of sculpture, \n\npainting and photography, music concerts, theatre performances and several other  \n\ncultural happenings (Zouros, 2004).   \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n56 \n\nR\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique of Haute Provence (France) and Hateg Country (Romania) European \n\ngeoparks, through holding exhibitions, and inter-cultural dialogue (dialogue between Man \n\nand Earth) among researchers, artists, teachers, and peasants strive for cultural sustain-\n\nability in their territories (Andr??anu and Giraud, 2009).   \n\nPuay Liu and Abd Halim (2008) according to a pilot survey in villages in Padang Mat Sirat \n\nand Kilim of Langkawi Geopark noted that most local communities agreed that Radio \n\nLangkawi FM was a major source of information on Langkawi Geopark, particularly when \n\nit played Geopark local song during the morning airtime show. The local community said \n\nthat the geopark song helped to remind them that Langkawi is a geopark.   \n\nAccording to Ramsay et al. (2010a), the presentation of traditional dances, music and  \n\nstories during the Geoparks week is another strategy for cultural sustainability in Hateg \n\nCountry Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania).  \n\nProviding geo-trails (a geo-trail is a service that promotes hiking and outdoor education) \n\npassing through the villages and the surrounding cultural landscapes (Rodrigues and  \n\nCarvalho, 2009) is another strategy for cultural sustainability in geoparks. These geo-trails \n\nare opportunities for visitors to observe and to experience the lifestyle, architecture,  \n\ncustoms and cuisine of local people who live in the geopark territory.   \n\nThe Global Geopark Bergstrasse-Odenwald, situated in the southwest of the State of \n\nHesse (Germany), designed a geo-trail with two sections through the cultural landscape of \n\nMichelstadt\u2019s graben structure. The geo-trail of Michelstadt offers geological features, cul-\n\ntural highlights and mining history to visitors. Moreover, an annual program for guided \n\ntours is available for tourists (McKeever et al., 2010). Another important tool to communi-\n\ncate the vivid relationship between man and nature is the implementation of geo-points in \n\nthe Bergstrasse\u2013Odenwald Geopark. These geo-points contain earth history and connect \n\nit with local history and tradition (Weber, 2009).  \n\nAside from the above activities, reconstruction of architectural elements in geoparks can \n\nbe a solution to achieve cultural sustainability. Regarding this, Cabo de Gata European \n\nGeopark (Spain) runs a project of rehabilitation and consolidation of the water-wheels as \n\nthe most numerous and important architectural elements in the landscape of the Cabo de \n\nGata region (Mendoza and Navarro, 2007).  \n\nWith the purpose of understanding the folklore and the character of Sobrarbe European \n\nGeopark (Spain) various public and private initiatives have emerged to recover and man-\n\nage the mining heritage in this territory. The Sobrarbe Geopark supports these projects \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n57 \n\nand works to unite them, so they can be effectively managed. In order to achieve this goal, \n\nthere are currently three infrastructures distributed throughout the area: the Geopark  \n\nInterpretation Centre, the Bielsa Museum and the Geo-mining circuit. The Interpretation \n\nCentre (A\u00ednsa Castle) presents the mining heritage, especially the geology related to min-\n\neral deposit formation. The community\u2019s way of life is highlighted at the Bielsa Museum. \n\nLastly, the Geo-mining circuit summarizes, in five panels, the role of mining technology \n\nacross the landscape (Poch, 2007). \n\nExamples also illustrate that geoparks aim to revive traditional food, local arts, and tradi-\n\ntional culture through exposing them to tourists; thereby geoparks, by promoting geotour-\n\nism and innovative strategies, reduce the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in their \n\nterritory.  \n\nNaturtejo European Geopark, for the purposes of cultural preservation, tries to improve \n\nlocal products and a service related to nature and cultural tourism, and strives to increase \n\nthe level of use of equipment and services and cultural tours to both the resident popula-\n\ntion and tourists. Authorities of Naturtejo European Geopark also develop network activi-\n\nties, tourism marketing and cultural programming in this territory (Marques, 2009). \n\nThe establishment of a brand new geo-restaurant in Naturtejo European Geopark not only \n\nlooked for inspiration in the local landscape but also revived past civilizations and ancient \n\nculture thousands of years old. This geo-restaurant was opened in 2010 by Carlos Santos, \n\na businessman from Idanha-a-Nova. He tries to stimulate traditional flavours (Naturtejo \n\nGeopark Authorities, 2010a). \n\nUsing the brand or logo of geoparks for promoting quality of local products as cultural \n\ncomponents can be another strategy for rehabilitation of at least some of them. In order to \n\nevaluate agro-tourism enterprises, the Psiloritis Natural Park and European Geopark \n\n(Greece) organized a project titled \u201dLand of Psiloritis\u201d in the geopark territory. Regarding \n\nthis, members which use the geopark logo as the brand name for a network of cooperat-\n\ning enterprises have to fulfil certain quality standards that have been set in collaboration \n\nwith the geopark and are evaluated every year by a common group of specialists (Fassou-\n\nlas and Zouros, 2010).   \n\nThe last but not the least strategy as an innovation for cultural sustainability in geoparks is \n\nthe integration of handicrafts or local products as cultural components with geopark char-\n\nacteristics (e.g. geo-products). \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n58 \n\nGeo-products are local products related to geopark activities and are symbols of geologi-\n\ncal and geomorphological heritage of the geopark (Rodrigues and Carvalho, 2009;  \n\nFarsani et al., 2010).  \n\nGeo-products which are made based on geological elements of geoparks not only intro-\n\nduce the local products and the local handicrafts as cultural components to tourists, but \n\nalso increase the public knowledge of tourists about geology.  \n\nPursuant to geopark activities, it is evident that geoparks can play a role in the cultural \n\nsustainability of their territories.  \n\nAccording to Nickerson (2010) geotourism strives to sustain the region\u2019s landscape \n\nthrough perpetuation of local values and attracting visitors who actively promote local  \n\nvalues through their travel behaviour. The responsibility of geotourism is to keep things \u2018as \n\nthey are\u2019 for the resident or develop things \u2018their way\u2019 rather than change for visitors.  \n\nGeotourism as a target of geoparks increases value of the local business, local landscape \n\nand culture connected to the geopark. As mentioned before, there are cultural trails in \n\ngeoparks in which tourists observe cultural panorama and are educated about the relation \n\nbetween geological heritage and cultural heritage. \n\n \n\n2.10.  Socioeconomical Impacts of the Establishment of Geoparks \n\nThe purpose of this section is to investigate the effects of geopark creation on the devel-\n\nopment of the local economy through geotourism. Since tourism marketing is a key factor \n\nin the development of the local economy, the section starts by reviewing the literature on \n\ntourism and economy. After that the literature provides an overview of issues relating to \n\ngeoparks, geotourism and the local economy.  \n\nHorn and Simmons (2002) noted that the economic importance of tourism plays a role in \n\ndetermining residents\u2019 attitudes. As economic benefits increase, residents\u2019 attitudes  \n\nbecome more favourable. In general, tourism is favoured by developing economies  \n\nbecause it is a so-called invisible export (Brohman, 1996). This means it brings foreign \n\nexchange into the country without shipping any resource or product abroad.   \n\nThe money that tourists spend remains typically in local hands. Research by Hampton \n\n(1998) and Scheyvens (2002) validates this point. Both researchers found that back-\n\npackers, typically explorers or drifters by nature, make significant contributions to local \n\neconomies without triggering significant leakage. The money that backpackers spend \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n59 \n\ngoes directly to local people who themselves are supported by a network of local produc-\n\ners ranging from farmers to labourers and artisans. Therefore, small-scale local invest-\n\nment in tourism has positive impacts on the local economy.  \n\nThe experience of Paul Lepp (2004) in Uganda, East Africa, illustrated that the involve-\n\nment of local communities would best describe the present state of tourism development. \n\nIn this regard, the government should encourage local people to promote tourism in rural \n\nareas.  \n\nIn view of the fact that it provides economic and other benefits to local residents, such as \n\ncreating job opportunities and generating income, as well as some other services, prod-\n\nucts and supplies, geotourism has, nowadays, been introduced as  a best form of sustain-\n\nable rural tourism marketing. \n\nSince all abiotic natural objects are located in rural areas, development of geotourism in \n\nthese areas can be a chance for rural development (B?benek, 2006). Geotourism devel-\n\nopment also represents a partnership between the government, local people, and private \n\nsectors: local businesses, active tourism companies, tour agencies, restaurants and  \n\naccommodation among others. This partnership is welcomed because it makes good eco-\n\nnomic sense and can benefit all partners (Dowling, 2009). For instance, geoparks and \n\ngeotourism development may have a great potential for local sustainable socioeconomic \n\ndevelopment. In China, the focus is the enhancement of employment and new economic \n\nactivities linked to the specialties of each geopark. The establishment of individual \n\ngeoparks should favour new orientations in tourism (geotourism), and in trades and crafts \n\n(geo-products), such as the sustainable manufacturing of innovative handicrafts which \n\nhave a geological connotation, for example fossil casting and souvenirs (Xun and Milly, \n\n2002).  \n\nLocal governments of Yuntai Geopark in Henan (China), introduced geotourism as a new \n\neconomic growth point which can improve the expense of geoheritage preservation,  \n\nincrease local revenue and enhance employment. In 2001, the number of visitors reached \n\n600,000, and the income from admission fees amounted to 14 million Yuan, twice the  \n\naverage of the previous years. In 2002, the number of visitors soared to 940,000 and the \n\nincome from admission fees increased to 27.2 million Yuan, up 68% and 97%, respec-\n\ntively, compared with the previous year. More than 60 hotels were newly built in the \n\ncounty, and about 4,000 jobs were provided by tourism development (Xun and Ting, \n\n2003). \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n60 \n\nAnother example in China is Jinhu Geopark in Taining County, Fujian Province, estab-\n\nlished in 2000. Tourism marketing attracts a great number of visitors to this territory. In \n\n2001, the total revenues from tourism reached 202 million Yuan, 35.7% over the previous \n\nyear, accounting for 13.5% of the county\u2019s GDP. Revenues from tourism increased to 450 \n\nmillion Yuan, up 123% compared with the previous year and accounting for nearly 30% of \n\nthe county\u2019s GDP. Thus, tourism has become a pillar industry of the county. It has brought \n\nalong such trades as catering, transportation and cultural recreation, providing employ-\n\nment for about 2,800 people (Xun and Ting, 2003). \n\nZouros (2004) noted that the Petrified Forest of Lesvos (Greece) is in collaboration with \n\nnine agro-tourist cooperatives, and during the summer period the Petrified Forest Natural \n\nHistory Museum organizes an agro-tourist festival. In order to promote the quality of local \n\nproducts, food and drinks made using old recipes from the women of the surrounding  \n\nvillages of geopark are used. In addition, the Petrified Forest of Lesvos European Geopark \n\nhas created links with local tourist enterprises, restaurants and small hotels in order to  \n\nincrease the number of park visitors. Pursuant to geopark establishment and local gover-\n\nnors\u2019 activities, the amount of \u201cBed and Breakfast\u201d accommodation has doubled in the  \n\nvillage of Sigri. What\u2019s more, the visitors have increased the duration of their visit to the \n\ngeopark. McKeever et al., (2010,p.225) described the creation of the Lesvos Petrified  \n\nForest European Geopark (Greece) as transforming western Lesvos, attracting 90,000 \n\nvisitors annually and employing 35 locals directly and with hundreds of new jobs having \n\nbeen created indirectly. The geopark is now the island\u2019s main visitor attraction and is an \n\nexcellent example of how the holistic approach to conservation used in geoparks can be \n\nsuccessful from the perspective of the local community.  \n\nNowlan et al. (2004) explained that the decline of the rural economy in recent years has \n\nmeant the depopulation of many small towns in North America. Such areas, by converting \n\nto geoparks, can take enormous advantage from geopark-related activities. Examples in-\n\nclude places with exceptional fossils, rocks or minerals, areas with a rich history of mining \n\nor energy development that is now finished, and remote communities in northern regions. \n\nThus, establishment of geoparks in North America can increase tourism to these areas \n\nand help to reverse a declining economy. \n\nAccording to Dusar (2004), the application of the geopark concept to the mountain karst \n\nareas in Vietnam may be the best way to guarantee preservation of the unique karst land-\n\nscape, offering at the same time sustainable development and an acceptable share of the \n\nnational improvement of standards of life to its inhabitants.   \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n61 \n\nEstablishing family guest houses (Bed and Breakfast) in Naturtejo European Geopark \n\n(Portugal) can be a strategy to promote the local economy. An example for this is Casa de \n\nForno, an ancient community oven that was turned in to cosy accommodation and a geo-\n\nbakery. Casa de Forno is managed by a geologist couple and their family. They also or-\n\nganize some outdoor and geo-tour activities for visitors (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009), \n\nsuch as TTransGeopark 4x4.  \n\nNaturtejo Geopark organizes a project of promotion of geological heritage, and local eco-\n\nnomic development through geotourism. Collaborating with active tourism company Incen-\n\ntivos Outdoor (which runs the boat trips to the Porta de Rod\u00e3o Natural monument and the \n\nNeolithic Tejo Rock Art), organizing geo-sports (geo-kayaking in Portas de Rod\u00e3o and \n\nTagus River), consulting with local businesses to produce geo-products (geo-pizza, trilo-\n\nbite and geo-cakes), establishing geo-restaurants, etc., are new activities which the local \n\nmanagement of the geopark applied to promote the local economy (Rodrigues and Car-\n\nvalho, 2009).  \n\nThe European Geopark Bergstrasse-Odenwald (Germany), in order to promote geotour-\n\nism, invited local groups to join the geopark on-site network and to participate in training \n\nfor geopark administration. By the end of 2009, more than 150 active geopark guides, as \n\npart of the geopark\u2019s visitor service, were trained. This activity is not only a step towards \n\nsustainable development, but also creates job opportunities for local communities (Eck-\n\nhardt, 2009).  \n\nFurthermore, Turner (2006) urged that establishing geoparks in Australian-Pacific regions \n\ncan bring benefits for farmers in rural areas and small businesses.   \n\nThe geopark also supports the marketing of local handicrafts such as production of fossil \n\ncasts and souvenirs by local enterprises. The local products are supplied in agro-tourist \n\nfestivals or are also sold in the Museum snack-bar (Zouros, 2009).  \n\nThe Quinta da Vila\u2019s service is family accommodation located in Alvarenga village (Arouca \n\nmunicipality) which is certified by the Arouca Geopark Association. Quinta da Vila offers \n\ngeopark adventure sport programs (geopark experience packages). It is noteworthy  \n\nthat 41% of the 2010 Quinta da Vila's sales were made through the experience packages \n\n(Peres, 2011).   \n\nMoreover, S. Pedro Hotel located in Arouca Geopark promotes programs and experience \n\npackages of nature, adventure and cultural tourism of the geopark.  At the end of 2011, \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n62 \n\nthe occupancy rate of 33.45% means a positive trend, being higher than the 24.80% of the \n\nprevious years (Brito, 2011).  \n\nConsequently, geotourism as a niche market is still at an early stage of commercial devel-\n\nopment, but experiences and examples illustrate that the creation of geoparks and the  \n\ndevelopment of geotourism as a branch of sustainable tourism can be an innovative solu-\n\ntion for the development of rural economies. \n\n \n\n2.11.  Socio-Environmental Impacts of the Establishment of Geoparks \n\nAside from the development of the local economy, preservation of natural heritage and \n\npopularization of the environment, science, especially geo-sciences, is the main target of \n\nthe establishment of geoparks.  \n\nIn order to achieve these goals, each geopark should take advantage of local knowledge \n\nand should try to ascertain the best means of knowledge transfer in its territory.  \n\nThis section looks at the strategies applied by geoparks for education, conservation of the \n\nnatural heritage and minimization of negative impacts of tourism upon the environment.  \n\n \n\n2.11. 1. Geoconservation in Geoparks \n\nEnvironmental values refer to individual and shared community or society beliefs about \n\nthe significance, importance, and well-being of the natural environment, and how the natu-\n\nral world should be viewed and treated by humans (Reser and Bentrupperb\u00e4umer, 2005). \n\nTourism has consequences for the environment, sometimes positive and not uncommonly \n\nnegative. For instance, mass tourism has a negative impact on natural resources; that is \n\nwhy local communities are usually not interested in it (Fennell, 2003). Tourism for Nature \n\n(ecotourism), the creation of national parks and wildlife parks (e.g., Yellowstone Park in \n\nUSA and the Amboseli National Park, Kenya), protection of reefs and beaches in the \n\nGreat Barrier Reef (Australia), and maintenance of forests such as the New Forest (UK) \n\nare positive direct environmental impacts associated with tourism (Cooper et al., 2005). \n\nGeoheritage, which draws attention to the geological and geomorphological elements of \n\nnature worthy of conservation, has for years been considered less vulnerable than other \n\nenvironmental values. Therefore, it has not received the same amount of attention from \n\nthe conservationist movement as cultural and ecological heritage (Reynard and Coratza, \n\n2007). \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n63 \n\nReimold (1999) argued the importance of geoconservation. His study has some major \n\npurposes. Firstly, geoheritage is a part of general environmental protection; secondly, \n\neducation relies on well-preserved natural instruction sites; thirdly, scientific use demands \n\nprotection of this heritage, for future examination, for comparison with new discoveries, \n\nand for renewed scrutiny of previous hypotheses.   \n\nGeodiversity (Gray, 2004) is currently used in parallel with the term \u2018biodiversity\u2019 to indi-\n\ncate the natural diversity of the abiotical part of nature and its influence on both biodiver-\n\nsity and cultural diversity.  \n\nAccording to Burek and Prosser (2008) geoconservation is a growing activity, with more \n\nparticipants and a greater profile now than ever before. They noted that geoconservation \n\nis very well established in the United Kingdom and increasingly across Europe and Aus-\n\ntralia, and with the World Heritage List and especially the rapid growth of geoparks; it is \n\nnow coming to importance in many other parts of the world.  \n\nGeological Societies (lUGS) and UNESCO have been sponsoring a project called GEO-\n\nSITES, which aims at the preservation of unique and typical sites, representing geology, \n\ngeomorphology, stratigraphy, paleontology, archaeology, hydrology, etc., on a global level \n\n(Wimbledon, 1996; Wimbledon et al., 1996). To this end, Reimold (1999) suggested that \n\ngeoconservation on the African continent has not featured very prominently to date and \n\nunique and typical geosites need to be identified. In Switzerland, for example, a working \n\ngroup on geotopes was founded by the Swiss Academy of Sciences in 1994 (Heitzmann \n\net al., 2006); a strategic report on geotopes was published in 1995 (Strasser et al., 1995) \n\nto be followed by a similar report on geoparks (Reynard and Coratza, 2007), and the first \n\nlist of geosites of national significance was published in 1998 (Working Group for the Pro-\n\ntection of Geotopes in Switzerland, 1999). \n\nJohnson et al. (2010) noted that converting a geological site to a geosite, and, if the size \n\nand relevance are applicable, to a geopark may be not only the best way to promote tour-\n\nism marketing in these areas, but also a strategy to preserve geological heritage. For  \n\nexample, the island of Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean, where geology, scenery and \n\nclimate are closely similar to those of Hawaii, can be converted to a geopark in order to \n\nattain a sustainable development model.   \n\nMoreover, Pereira et al. (2007) presented the various steps involved in the compilation of \n\nthe inventory, selection, and assessment of sites of geomorphological interest for promo-\n\ntion by the Montesinho Natural Park Board (Portugal), especially with regards to their edu-\n\ncational value.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n64 \n\nSince education can be a means of conservation of natural heritage (both biological and \n\ngeological), Anderson and Brown (2010) demonstrated that activities such as creating \n\nteaching resources, using the latest technologies, supporting field trips, building up a web-\n\nsite presence, promoting school visits, conferences, exhibitions, supporting museums, and \n\ndisseminating information through major teaching associations can be good examples of \n\nhow to popularize and preserve the Quaternary of the British Isles. \n\nBesides, geoconservation can contribute to the objectives of Agenda 21, highlighting the \n\npotential for interaction between socioeconomic development and conservation of the \n\nnatural environment. This approach allows consideration of other issues like geodiversity, \n\ngeological heritage, geotourism, geoparks, and geoeducation as concepts of geoconser-\n\nvation (Andr??anu, 2007a and 2007b) (Figure 2.14). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.14 - Basic concepts in geoconservation and their relationships \n\n( Source: Andr??anu, 2007) \n\nIn the last decade, the UNESCO declaration on geoparks as a new model of sustainable \n\ndevelopment has highly strengthened the strategies such as local communities\u2019 participa-\n\ntion in protecting natural heritage, organizing educational programs, and promoting geot-\n\nourism. It is stated that indigenous people should not be removed from the lands where \n\nthey live, since the locals\u2019 knowledge, traditional arts, and traditional style of life play a  \n\nvital role in geopark management.   \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n65 \n\nAs mentioned before, geoparks are set up at an international level but managed at a local \n\nlevel. Hence, geopark authorities encourage local communities to follow cultural inter-\n\nchange and identity preservation. They also motivate local people to participate effectively \n\nin achieving sustainable development and sustainable tourism in geoparks.  \n\nManagers of geoparks try to improve the welfare of indigenous communities through inno-\n\nvative activities and consulting with local business people, artists, tour operators, private \n\nsectors, accommodation facilities, restaurants, and producers. In addition, they involve \n\nlocals in conservation and educational activities, and imparting of local knowledge.  \n\nThe officials employ network activities for the implementation of geopark targets (Figure \n\n2.15). The network illustrates the close relation between geotourism and geoparks and \n\nlocal communities, private sectors, local government, schools, universities, environment, \n\nbusinesspeople, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and tourism sectors. A regional \n\nnetwork can provide the most appropriate and practical mechanism for sharing informa-\n\ntion, education, and training resources. Also, establishing related organizations can help in \n\ninformation management, communication links, training and advisory services, sharing \n\nexperiences, research, and development. \n\nWhereas conservation is a target of geoparks, environment organization has close col-\n\nlaboration with the geopark. However, in the geopark the conservation activities have a \n\nspecific form, since the geopark tries to involve locals in preserving their territory. Geopark \n\nofficials believe that no one knows the area better than the local people; therefore they \n\nstimulate locals to conserve the geopark through economic incentives and education.  \n\nEach geopark, in order to be preserved, utilizes innovative strategies.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n66 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15 - Networks in geoparks activities (Source: own construction)  \n\n \n\n2.11.1.1.  Involving Local Communities in Geopark Activities \nAs mentioned in the last section, preparing an inventory of geological heritage, introducing \n\ngeotopes and establishing geosites and geoparks can be a way to conserve geological \n\nheritage sites. However, for this purpose geoparks utilize innovative strategies in order to \n\npromote conservation of natural heritage. The first strategy is local communities\u2019 involve-\n\nment in geopark conservation. In most geoparks, officials take advantage of indigenous \n\nknowledge for geopark conservation and management, and in this case, the geopark  \n\ndirectly develops the local economy through the creation of supplementary income for  \n\nlocals and improves their natural and geological knowledge.    \n\nAccording to Azman et al. (2010), one of the key factors for sustainable conservation in \n\ngeoparks is the level of awareness of stakeholders, particularly the local communities. \n\nRegarding this Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) prepared a special brochure explaining \n\nLangkawi Geopark and distributed it to local villagers, organized a regional conference, \n\ninvolved local women in geopark activities, encouraged locals to diversify their traditional \n\nactivities to commercial activities and made a short announcement about geoparks in the \n\nmosques. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n67 \n\nSustainable development in recycling the hawksbill turtle hatchery with the help of indige-\n\nnous people was a strategy in Qeshm Global Geopark, Iran. This movement not only pre-\n\nserved marine turtles but also created seasonal job opportunities for locals (UNDP, \n\n2003a). In this project which is supported by UNDP (United Nations Development  \n\nProgramme), local people are paid by the government for their contribution in collecting \n\nthe turtle eggs and then transferring them to the protected coast in Shibderaz which is \n\nmanaged by local people. This successful experience saved 27000 turtle eggs and 16000 \n\nturtles in 2003. \n\nAt present, preservation of marine turtles continues under the support of Qeshm Geopark \n\nand local Environmental Department.  \n\nA pilot project in Salakh village was another strategy in Qeshm Geopark territory. It was \n\ndeveloped for the rehabilitation of natural marine resources through an indigenous method \n\nof artificial reefing. The process of artificial reefing is completed, secured, and guarded by \n\nlocal fishermen (UNDP, 2001). \n\nAquaculture of pearls by the local community, especially women of the Berkeh Khalaf  \n\nvillage, was the third strategy for preserving natural resources and entrepreneurship for \n\nlocal women in Qeshm Geopark (UNDP, 2003b). \n\nMoreover, the Copper Coast European Geopark (Ireland) collaborated in the construction \n\nof a wetland project for preserving a bog, and the eco-park used the development of this \n\nintegrated constructed wetland to organically treat their waste water whilst supporting a \n\ndiverse range of flora and fauna, and improving the beautiful environmental features. It \n\nhas the added benefit of maintaining the character of the surrounding landscape. This  \n\nproject created 350 job opportunities for locals (Richardson and Shakespeare, 2009). \n\nAside from local communities\u2019 involvement, integrating national and international events \n\nwith geopark activities is another strategy for earth conservation. For instance, on World \n\nForest Day, Casa do Forno outdoor company and geobakery with Naturtejo Geopark  \n\ninvited media and the local people from the village of Orvalho to know more about cultiva-\n\ntion of native plants, touching the soil to plant a Viburnum or a Prunus lusitanica, two of \n\nthe endangered tree species to be found at Fraga da \u00c1gua d\u2019Alta geosite. This natural \n\nmonument presents one of the last natural refuges in Europe for the evergreen forest that \n\nexisted more than 2 million years ago.  \n\nMoreover, On Clean Portugal Day (20th March) Naturtejo Geopark, Castelo Branco, \n\nOleiros, Proen\u00e7a-a-Nova and Idanha-a-Nova municipalities supported the initiative and \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n68 \n\ninvited about 550 volunteers to clean the geopark territory. Despite the rain, they cleaned \n\n83 tons of garbage (Naturtejo Geopark Authorities, 2010b). \n\nIn addition, geoparks have an important role in landscape preservation. Therefore, the  \n\nofficials of geoparks rebuild historic and old places instead of modernizing them. Regard-\n\ning this the R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence European Geopark (France) has  \n\nrebuilt an old house for the art installment in Veil Esclangon (Unjah,2008), and the \n\nNaturtejo European Geopark (Portugal), at Portas de Almour\u00e3o geomonument, and \n\nPenha Garcia Ichnological Park, has changed the use of four dilapidated historical build-\n\nings; they have been converted to popular tourism facilities like a conference hall, tourism \n\noffice, and museum to follow the tenets of sustainable tourism in the geopark. It is  \n\nnoteworthy that Casa de Forno which is located in Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) territory \n\nwas an ancient community oven that was almost in ruins in 2007, and was saved by a  \n\nlocal couple of geologists and their family; it has been turned into cosy accommodation \n\nand a geobakery (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009).  \n\nMoreover, Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), in order to protect the geological heritage of  \n\nPortas de Almour\u00e3o geosite from flooding, contributed to the project of building the Alvito \n\nReservoir 1 km upstream. The implementation of this project caused less environmental \n\nimpact on the geomonument. In the project there were several environmental issues such \n\nas: following up the project in order to minimize impact on the geological heritage; devel-\n\noping heritage and valuing the region; and eliminating barriers for the ichthyofauna. These \n\nwere controlled by the Naturtejo Geopark (Carvalho and Rodrigues, 2010b).  \n\nSince education and involvement of locals in conservation projects can be ways for  \n\nconservation of natural heritage (ecological-geological), the next section will focus on the \n\neducational activities and programs, as a strategy for conservation of natural heritage in \n\ngeoparks around the world.  \n\n \n\n2.11.1.2.  Educational Activities in Geoparks \n\nIn fact, since long ago people have come to visit \"geological wonders\u201d like mountains, \n\ncaves, and canyons. However, only in recent times has there been a real challenge in this \n\nsector and geological heritage has been developed into a market (geotourism) with very \n\nspecific and novel characteristics. \n\nNature Tourism is supported by sustainable use of natural heritage and promoting nature \n\nawareness, through interpretation. Nature Tourism as a niche market has grown world \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n69 \n\nwide in recent years and looks for certified destinations, as the authors want to develop it \n\nin geoparks under the auspices of UNESCO. \n\nGeotourism is an emerging segment of Nature Tourism in which the objective focuses on \n\ngeodiversity. A new niche market was created for business with new specificities and new \n\ncontingencies that not only accompanies the general trends of tourism but also imposes \n\nits own trends. Geoparks are pioneers in geotourism and an example of sustainable local \n\ndevelopment. A geopark acts as a partnership of people and land managers working to \n\npromote earth heritage through education and sustainable tourism (Bailey and Hill, 2010).  \n\nDias and Brilha (2004) noted that in order to increase public awareness about geological \n\nheritage, some initiatives should be implemented for each protected area, like geological \n\nand geomorphological maps, as well as a geosite map, a geological guidebook, web \n\npages, geological trails, and interpretative panels. These are all examples of innovation \n\n(Figure 2.16).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.16 - Proposed initiatives in order to increase public awareness of geological  \n\nheritage (Source: Dias and Brilha, 2004) \n\nGeological processes with high scientific interest can be associated with aesthetics and \n\nbecome geosites, with tourism potential. The intention is to stimulate knowledge of geodi-\n\nversity, geoconservation, and sustainable development. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n70 \n\nBeside geodiversity, geotourism has some other benefits; a site with rich geological heri-\n\ntage should have cultural, historical, and natural (bio and geo) approaches. But it is impor-\n\ntant to present a good interpretation and supportive structure.  \n\nA geopark organizes activities and provides logistic support to communicate geoscientific \n\nknowledge and environmental concepts to the public. This is accomplished through  \n\nprotected and interpreted geosites. \n\nMuseums, information centres, geo-trails, guided tours, school class excursions, popular \n\npublications, maps, educational materials and displays, seminars, and so on are strate-\n\ngies applied by geoparks to educate locals and tourists. A plan for sustainable develop-\n\nment in a geopark territory needs interdisciplinary studies and cooperation among univer-\n\nsities, local authorities, and different stakeholders (Andr??anu, 2005). A geopark also fos-\n\nters scientific research and cooperation with universities and research institutes, stimulat-\n\ning the dialogue between the geosciences and the local population. Moreover, a geopark \n\ncan create the framework, motivation, and support for integrated research, education and \n\ntraining.  \n\nEducation, as a lifelong process, is widely accepted as a fundamental prerequisite for the \n\nachievement of sustainable development. It is also recognized as a means of changing \n\nconsumption and production patterns to a more sustainable path (DiSano, 1995).  \n\nSince education is a target of geopark creation and local schoolchildren\u2019s education can \n\nhave serious consequences for sustainable development, most of the geoparks, as  \n\nspectacular outdoor classrooms, have set up educational work programmes to re-orient \n\neducation towards sustainable development.  \n\nGeoeducation, formal or informal, is a part of the conservation purposes of geological heri-\n\ntage sites that have worth for scientific, educational, and aesthetic reasons. Inventory, da-\n\ntabases, and maps of sites are not enough for geopark conservation; it is necessary to set \n\nup educational strategy in partnership with local schools, universities, and local councils. \n\nThe aim of the Global Geoparks Network is to provide a platform of cooperation and  \n\nexchange of knowledge between experts and practitioners in geological heritage matters \n\nunder the umbrella of UNESCO. Establishing geopark museums and interpretive centres, \n\nholding annual conferences of the European Geoparks Network and the Global Geoparks \n\nNetwork, holding annual meetings, organizing workshops for tourists and locals, publish-\n\ning books, newspapers, and magazines, interviewing on TV and organizing radio training \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n71 \n\nfor tour guides, and investing in educational programs for schoolchildren and universities \n\nare geopark enterprises in this regard.  \n\nFor instance, officials of Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal) believe that educational \n\nprograms can be a means of conservation of geomonuments and natural heritage.  \n\nAccordingly, they implement an educational program for schools and universities. \n\nNaturtejo Geopark started the educational programs in 2007 and by the end of 2009 they \n\nhad succeeded in educating 3813 students and teachers between the ages of 4 to more \n\nthan 70 years old. This program embraces two educational activities including \u2018School \n\nMeets the Geopark\u2019 and \u2018The Geopark Goes to School\u2019. In this regard, the geopark has \n\nemployed local geologists and former teachers, since no one knows the geopark territory \n\nbetter than locals (Catana and Rocha, 2009).  \n\nApart from the educational program for schoolchildren, Naturtejo Geopark established a \n\ndinosaur exhibition in 2010. This exhibition received 22041 visitors, over the course of 7 \n\nmonths, in many educational programs (Naturtejo Geopark Authorities, 2010c).   \n\nFurthermore, officials of Arouca European Geopark (Portugal) play a vital role in educa-\n\ntional programs and at the end of 2009 they succeeded in educating 3956 pupils and 331 \n\nteachers who came from all over the country (Catana and Rocha, 2009). Likewise, the \n\ngeopark runs an educational project called \u201cGeoteca\u201d. This project was initially developed \n\nfor local school libraries and the main goal of the project was to improve the knowledge of \n\nstudents and teachers about Arouca Geopark (Rocha et al., 2009). In this regard, the \n\ngeopark held a workshop entitled \u201cMake your own Trilobite\u201d. This workshop reinforced the \n\nknowledge of the students about trilobites and geopark activities; the children painted  \n\ntrilobites and dressed up as trilobites, raft boats and hikers at Carnival 2009.  \n\nMoreover, the R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence European Geopark (France), with \n\na view to geo-education, established the so-called \u201cGeorium\u201d in the Museum Premonade, \n\nas a part of an interactive tool for schoolchildren from 6 to 13 years old. \n\nBesides, in order to maintain the standard of scientific information and quality of guides, all \n\nguides are encouraged to take the course with the R\u00e9serve. At present, 23 active nature \n\nguides have joined the R\u00e9serve domestic network. Guides and their partners, through \n\neducational programs, have attracted much more tourist attention to this area. Training \n\ngeotourism guides is another educational innovative activity in this territory (Unjah, 2008).  \n\nHolding workshops for children on minerals, water, and volcanoes and organizing work-\n\nshops for adults on volcanology, minerals, and fossils are educational activities in  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n72 \n\nVulkaneifel European Geopark (Germany). Moreover, Vulkaneifel European Geopark  \n\norganizes the Willi Basalt tour for schoolchildren (Frey et al., 2006). \n\nEstablishing an educational centre in the noble castle that looks over the medieval town of \n\nA\u00ednsa in the heart of the Sobrarbe Geopark (Spain) is another strategy, which not only  \n\nincreases the locals\u2019 and tourists\u2019 knowledge but also preserves the castle as historical \n\nheritage. The noble castle has discarded its defensive role and become a vacationing, \n\neducational, and cultural complex; some of its recently created spaces are related to the \n\ngeopark. The three new facilities, the Sobrarbe Geopark visitor centre \u201cSpace of the  \n\nSobrarbe Geopark\u201d, the \u201cTechnical Office\u201d, and the \u201cGeovision Room\u201d were considered in \n\nthe Master Plan (2004-2007) and spread out among the northeast and southeast towers \n\nof the A\u00ednsa Castle (EGN, 2009a) \n\nThe Landscape Model of Water Erosion is a place (11 \u00d7 9 m in size) which represents the \n\ngeological approach to water activities. This model is an innovative educational model for \n\nkids to know more about the water erosion process in the Eisenwurzen European \n\nGeopark, Austria (Kollmann et al., 2009). Tourists and kids feel like Gulliver in Lilliput Land \n\nwhen they visit the landscape model of water erosion in Gallen Park (Kollmann and  \n\nMitterb\u00e4ck, 2009) \n\nThe GeoBox project and Geo-workshops are other educational programs for schoolchil-\n\ndren in Nature Park Eisenwurzen (Austria); these activities are concentrated on erosion, \n\nrivers, fossils and rocks (Ramsay et al., 2010b).  \n\nZouros (2010) urged the Lesvos Petrified Forest European Geopark (Greece) to organize \n\nenvironmental education programs for elementary and high school. In addition, activities \n\nsuch as geosite recognition, fossil excavation and conservation, nature observation, and \n\nbird watching are other educational programs in Lesvos Geopark. Normally, schools visit \n\nthe geopark during the spring and autumn, outside the main tourist period. A variety of \n\neducational tools have been created for the needs of environmental education programs \n\n(such as museum kits, an educational CD, booklets, student booklets) for all levels of \n\neducation. The two museum kits focus on plant fossils and volcanic rocks. Besides, the \n\ngeopark supports university field camps dedicated to various scientific disciplines.  \n\nMoreover, Lesvos Petrified Forest Geopark offers pupils knowledge about earthquakes; in \n\nthis regard it installed a seismic table simulator at the Natural History Museum of the  \n\nLesvos Petrified Forest to create an opportunity for schoolchildren to experience an earth-\n\nquake simulation (Zouros et al., 2010).   \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n73 \n\nFurthermore, the visitor information centre (The Lady Nelson) in Australian Global \n\nGeopark, Kanawinka, gives visitors both professional and recreational overview of the  \n\nregion, and this place helps in employing local and other scientists, writers, photogra-\n\nphers, and artists to produce dedicated geopark literature. In addition, the visitors can en-\n\njoy seeing and hearing the erupting neon volcano in the geology room of the visitor centre \n\nand they can have a walking tour in a glass floor cave (The Lady Nelson Centre, 2009). \n\nIn 2008, English Riviera European Geopark (UK) ran a project titled \u201cRock It!\u201d This is a \n\ntwo-year community development and education project that is focusing entirely on work-\n\ning with local people to enhance awareness and enjoyment of the geopark. Schools and \n\nother youth groups are being given the opportunity to experience various geological sites \n\nwith local schools. Curriculum linked resources, educational support materials and  \n\nprograms of study are being developed in partnership with local teachers through new and \n\nexisting networks. In addition, the project is providing information and interpretation mate-\n\nrials to the public and educational groups. The project improved educational tools such as \n\nsignposting, providing maps and information in the form of leaflets and developing the \n\ngeopark website (Acland, 2009). \n\nGea Norvegica European Geopark (Norway) has designed a site for students and teach-\n\ners of secondary schools (Figure 3.20). Also, Gea Norvegica Geopark has developed \n\nsome fundamental educational packages to be used in primary and secondary schools. \n\nConsequently, in March 2007, with the geopark\u2019s collaboration, geology became defined \n\nin the curriculum of secondary schools (Geo1 and Geo2) (Annual Report, 2007). \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Adamello Brenta Geopark (Italy) organizes educational activity \n\nunder the brand of \u201cPark Quality\u201d and until 2011, 19 schools among 59 schools located in  \n\ngeopark territory were awarded \u201cPark Quality\u201d (Mase and Maestranzi, 2011).  \n\nRegarding educational activity the Sobrarbe Geopark (Spain) established several trails, \n\nsuch as: karst trail, fluvial terraces trail and glacial landscapes trail, for pupils aged 12-16 \n\n(Ribas, 2011).  \n\nConsequently, apart from Global Geopark conferences, European Geopark conferences \n\nand meetings, which play an important role in the exchange of knowledge, each geopark \n\noffers a wide range of environmental education programs (related to culture, ecology and \n\ngeology) and field trips to find approaches to conservation, development, and public \n\nawareness.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n74 \n\nRegarding educational activity, each geopark tries to apply new strategies, by establishing \n\nthemed museums, establishing theme networks and trails, providing educational tools for \n\nvisitors, schoolchildren and kids (geotourism maps, signposts, interpretative panels, work-\n\nshops, geotour guides, etc.), organizing meetings between geopark authorities and local \n\ncommunities and holding conferences that constitute good examples.   \n\nThus, educational activities in geoparks can not only be a solution for achieving sustain-\n\nable development but they also increase the awareness of local communities and visitors \n\nabout their environment and the earth where they live. It is noteworthy that the idea of \n\neducation in geoparks includes non-formal education for people who are not at school \n\nanymore as well.  \n\n \n\n2.12.  Innovation in Geoparks \n\nThere are various definitions of the term \u201cinnovation\u201d, which derives from the Latin  \n\n\u201cinnovatio\u201d meaning the creation of something new (Table 2.7). Innovation includes both \n\nmajor and minor changes; major change being called radical innovation (Urabe, 1988). \n\nInnovation creates different (and hopefully better) approaches and thus innovation is a key \n\nthat may unlock growth (Sundbo, 2009). For the innovative enterprise to create pure profit, \n\nthe innovation should generate and maintain a unique competitive advantage in relation to \n\ncompetitors in the domestic market as well as in international trade. \n\nAll of the following introductions indicate that innovation is a new idea or brainwave, which \n\nends up creating new products, structure, technology, and so on, but this new idea, should \n\nbe profitable for business or industry.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n75 \n\nTable 2.7 - Innovation definitions from 1995 \u2013 2009 \n\n \n\nInnovation definitions\n\nInnovation is the core of competition and the dynamic efficiency of firms and industries \n(Schummpeter, 1934).  \n\nInnovation refers to the process of bringing any new, problem solving idea into use. Ideas for re-\norganizing, cutting costs, putting in new budgetary systems, improving communication or assem-\nbling products in terms are also innovation. Innovation is the generation, acceptance, and imple-\nmentation of new ideas, processes, products, or services (Kanter, 1983). \n\nInnovation consists of the generation of a new idea and its implementation into a new product, \nprocess, or service, leading to the dynamic growth of the national economy and the increase of \nemployment as well as to a creation of pure profit for the innovative business enterprise (Urabe, \n1988). \n\nInnovation is the search for, and the discovery of, development, improvement, adoption, and \ncommercialization of new processes, new products, and new organizational structures and proce-\ndures (Shy, 1995). \n\nInnovation is generation of new or improved products, introduction of new production processes, \ndevelopment of new sales markets; development of new supply markets, and reorganisation and \n/or restructuring of the company; this definition has distinguished the five areas (Schumpeter, \n1997). \n\nAn innovative community is therefore able to bring in new methods and ideas that can improve its \nenvironment and initiate changes through the imaginative ideas or artistic ability of its people \n(Velasquez et al., 2005). \n\nSuccessful innovation, e.g. innovation that is also profitable to the tourism firm in a competitive \nmarket must increase the value of the product or tourism experience (Weiermair, 2006). \n\nInnovation has to do with doing things differently (and hopefully better) and thus, innovation is a \nkey that unlocks growth (Sundbo, 2009) \n\n \n\nInnovation systems are both social and dynamic. It is dynamic due to the \u2018financial flows \n\nbetween government and private organizations, human flows between universities, firms, \n\nand government laboratories, regulation flows originating from government agencies  \n\ntowards innovation organizations, and knowledge flows among these institutions\u2019 (McLean \n\nand Pillia, 2005). The complexity of linkages in a system of innovation is well summarized \n\nby the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) diagram  \n\nillustrated in Figure 2.17. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.17- Actors and linkages in the innovation system (Source: OECD, 1999) \n\n \n\nThe tourism industry is often said to be less innovative than other industries (Hjalager, \n\n2002, 2010; Tetzschner and Herlau, 2003). Successful innovation is that which is also \n\nprofitable to the tourism firm in a competitive market and increases the value of the prod-\n\nuct or tourism experience (Weiermair, 2006). Nowadays, the globalization of cultures and \n\nfood both encourage social innovation in response to tourism. For example, where power-\n\nful destination influencers encourage the \u2018freezing\u2019 of cultural characteristics and manifes-\n\ntations in order to show tourists lifestyles and culture as visitor attractions, then technology \n\nand innovation are used to reinforce images of the past, in effect, establishing museums in \n\norder to exhibit spaces and the local culture of people for the sake of tourism. However, \n\ntourists\u2019 interest in local culture may reassert or reawaken local interest leading to cultural \n\npride and revival (Burns, 2006). \n\nHjalager (2002) argued an appropriate sub-division of innovation into five categories: \n\nproduct, process, management, logistic and institutional innovation. In recent decades, \n\ngeotourism, as a new marketing niche, needs innovative strategies to attract more tourists \n\nto geotourism destinations such as geoparks.   \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n77 \n\nGeoparks through promoting geotourism and applying initiatives under the umbrella of \n\nNetworks (Global Geoparks Network, European Geoparks Network, Asia-Pacific \n\nGeoparks Network, National and Local Geoparks Networks) try to popularize geological \n\nsciences, revive traditional culture, and promote local development (Farsani et al., 2010).    \n\nIn 2007, Jonathan B. Tourtellot noted that the enemy of geotourism is sameness (Miller \n\nand Washington, 2009). Thus, innovative strategies have an axial role in attracting tourists \n\ntoward geotourism destinations.  \n\nHowever, geoparks as ideal destinations for alternative tourism in rural areas are not an \n\nexception to that rule. In the following, some innovative activities in geoparks are summa-\n\nrized.   \n\nTERRAGAZE mobile, which is a portable multimedia system directed at geotourism and \n\ngeosciences education, is an innovative technology in geoparks. This electronic geological \n\nguide was recently improved by GPS support. In some geoparks a multimedia guide is \n\navailable for rent, while some bicycles in geoparks are equipped with TERRAGAZE  \n\n(Baucon, 2009). \n\nProviding a 3D virtual tour around the Adamello Brenta European Geopark (Italy) is  \n\nanother example of innovative technology in geoparks. The film has been made by means \n\nof the software 3D Real Time Exploration. This simulates a virtual flight over the protected \n\narea and visitors can visit the geosites. In addition, an MP3 audio guide is available for \n\nfree download, and the visitors can transfer the file to their MP3 player or mobile phone \n\n(Ferrari and Mase, 2009).  \n\nPsiloritis European Geopark in Greece invited the artists and craftsmen from Germany, \n\nFrance, and Psiloritis area to exchange ideas and to increase the bonds between the \n\nmanagement bodies of the Park and the local artists and craftsmen in order to create  \n\ninnovative strategies and products (Skoula and Fassoulas, 2006). \n\nCasa do Forno, as a family-rural accommodation and geo-bakery, joined the local network \n\nof partners from Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal). They also have a close collabo-\n\nration with geopark authorities. Casa do Forno has created some geo-products (local \n\nproducts which are symbols of, and provide information on geological heritage such as \n\ntrilobite cakes and Orogenic toasts) as innovative products. Naturtejo Geopark has permit-\n\nted them to use the geopark logo for their geo-products (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009).   \n\nThe establishment of the geo-restaurant Petiscos &amp; Granitos in Monsanto historical village \n\nis an innovative activity in Naturtejo European Geopark territory (Portugal). This village is \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n78 \n\nsituated on the slopes of a granite inselberg, where the houses were built in the  \n\nmiddle of giant boulders. It is worth mentioning that the restaurant includes a granite cave \n\nand serves a Geo-Dinner during events (Rodrigues and Carvalho, 2009). \n\nDevelopment of thematic visits in Naturtejo Geopark is one more innovative strategy in \n\nthis territory. Concerning this, a mine trail was built in this geopark. This walking trail is the \n\nstarting point for the development of a centre of geo-mining interpretation for the region of \n\nIdanha-a-Nova (Rodrigues et al., 2010).  \n\nDeveloping a geopark trails network which is also equipped for disabled visitors is another \n\ninnovative strategy in Beigua Geopark (Italy). Horse riding can be done in some parts of \n\ntrails, and a facility for learning \u201corienteering\u201d has been created. Establishing a small geo-\n\nlogical laboratory for children and an audio-visual hall are other strategies in order to \n\ntransform natural heritage into sustainable development. In addition, the geopark, with the \n\naim of enhancing the touristic success of the geopark, is organizing a new project called \n\n\u201cBeigua Card\u201d. The owner of this card can take advantage of a series of special offers and \n\ndiscounts in different commercial activities of the geopark (Burlando, et al., 2011).    \n\nEstablishment of brine swimming pools and salt baths in Subbetica Geopark (Spain) is \n\nanother geo-innovation offered to inhabitants and visitors of this geopark (Arroyo and \n\nBarquero, 2010).  \n\nFurthermore, a twinning agreement between geoparks is another innovative approach for \n\nbetter management of geoparks. \n\nOrganizing twinning projects, twinning exhibitions in rural areas of two geopark territories \n\nand twinning thematic courses for universities of two geoparks can be strategies for  \n\npromoting geotourism, culture, commerce and sharing knowledge. Twinning agreements \n\nand sister partnerships between geoparks are starting points for close cooperation  \n\nbetween geoparks.  \n\nFor instance, Stone Forest Global Geopark (China) and Xingwen Global Geopark (China) \n\nhave many similarities in some aspects, including geological formation and structure, so \n\nsigning the twinning agreement was quite beneficial to their mutual learning and common \n\ndevelopment (GGN, 2009). \n\nSa et al., (2010) provide an overview of a twinning agreement of cooperation between \n\nArouca Geopark (Portugal) and Araripe Geopark (Brazil). This collaboration allowed the \n\nBrazilian team to improve their knowledge about the management of a geopark as project \n\nof sustainable development.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n79 \n\nOwing to the establishment of transboundary geoparks \u2013 such as Novohrad-N\u00f3gr\u00e1d \n\nGeopark, located in the border of Slovakia and Hungary \u2013 the authorities of the geopark \n\nlaunched a project title \u201c how to organize a transboundary geopark\u201d  which can be a new \n\nmodel of geopark management ( Loska, 2011).  \n\nIn addition, in 2007 Lushan Geopark (China) and Bergstrasse-Odenwald (Germany)  \n\nimplemented a partnership in a wide range of topics like the development of geotouristic \n\nproducts, management, visitor services, infrastructure, geo-education and public informa-\n\ntion. Regarding this, they prepared panels with information about both geoparks in three \n\nlanguages (Chinese, German and English), and established a common geopark booth in \n\nfairs (Weber et al., 2010).   \n\nKanawinka Geopark includes landscapes according to the period and type of eruption, \n\nincluding Australia\u2019s youngest volcanoes, highly accessible volcanic cave systems, off-\n\nshore volcanic islands, remains of coastal volcanoes, and extensive systems of craters, \n\nlakes, and wetlands. In order to educate visitors a geology room is designed for them in \n\nthe geopark visitor centre where the visitors can enjoy seeing and hearing the erupting \n\nneon volcano. Moreover, organizing a walking tour in glass floor cave is another innova-\n\ntive activity in Kanawinka Geopark (The Lady Nelson Centre, 2009). \n\nUsing sustainable energy to reduce air pollution is a sustainable innovative strategy  \n\napplied by Naturepark TERRA.vita (Germany). E-bikes are equipped with an electric  \n\nmotor to ease biking in hilly areas. About 25 to 30 recharging stations are installed along \n\nthe trails. The stations are equipped with a solar panel to provide carbon-free energy for \n\nthe bike batteries (Escher, 2010).  \n\nRegarding conservation and sustainable use of mushrooms and truffles in Andaluc\u00eda, a \n\nmycological garden was established in Sierras Subbeticas Geopark (Spain). This centre \n\nincludes exhibition rooms, a microclimatic room of living mushrooms, audio-visual room, \n\nlaboratory, library and mycological herbarium; the garden opened to the public in January \n\n2011 (Arroyo and Barquero, 2011).   \n\nEstablishment of the Beja garden geological time trail, focussing on the geological forma-\n\ntion of south Portugal, from Precambrian to Quaternary, is a further innovative strategy for \n\npromoting geotourism, which developed by LNEG and Beja Municipality (Matos et al., \n\n2011).  \n\nFurthermore, mud therapy, pelotherapy, geo-wine \u2013 \u201clike Terras de Lava, Magma, Ba-\n\nsalto, Lajido, Pedras Brancas\u201d \u2013 labelled from volcanic products, geo-cooking \u2013 \u201c Cozido \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n80 \n\ndas Furnas\u201d \u2013 volcanic taste, and geo-poems are production innovations in the aspiring \n\nAzores Geopark, Portugal ( Rocha et al., 2011; Nunes, et al., 2011).   \n\nWith the purpose of highlighting innovative activities in geoparks, chapter 4 will focus on \n\ngeopark introduction, one by one, and will explain about innovative strategies which are \n\napplied by geoparks and in chapter 4, part 2, on the basis of Hjalager\u2019s (2002) definition of \n\ninnovation, the innovative strategies in geoparks will be described in the frame of the five \n\ncategories (production innovation, process innovation, management innovation, logistic \n\ninnovation, and institutional innovation). \n\n \n\n2.13.  Geopark Networks: An Innovative Approach  \n\nAccording to Hjalager\u2019s definition (2002) collaborative structures and authority systems \n\nbelong to the category of management innovation; thus, nowadays, collaboration in the \n\nform of Clusters or Networks (horizontal or vertical) is recognized as innovation in  \n\nmanagement, especially in rural development.  \n\nKnoke and Kuklinski (1983:12) explain networks as \u201ca specific type of relation linking a set \n\nof persons, objects or events\u201d. Porter (1998:78) describes clusters as \u201cgeographic concen-\n\ntrations of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field, linked by com-\n\nmonalities and complementarities\u201d.    \n\nNovelli et al. (2005) noted that networks and clusters as a framework can provide small \n\nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with innovative opportunities to operate in a com-\n\npetitive tourism environment. Most countries such as Italy, Belgium, France, United King-\n\ndom, Denmark, The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and Australia \n\napply network and cluster projects as management innovation. It is worth mentioning that \n\nItaly\u2019s clusters are widely spread and are part of the traditional economic process with no \n\nlegislation in place.  \n\nBerda et al. (2006) argued that tourism in Europe is dominated by small and medium-\n\nsized enterprises (SMEs) and most of them are in the form of family-owned businesses. \n\nShe supposed that these kinds of businesses can stimulate competition and play an  \n\nimportant role in creating job opportunities and the development of the local economy; \n\nhowever, globalization has led to a growing pressure on them. From the other point of \n\nview globalization provides an opportunity to benefit from the open world market. The \n\nemergence of tourism clusters, the establishment of networks and strong partnerships \n\namong private sectors, and between public and private sectors are examples of benefits. \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n81 \n\nLowe et al. (1995) described that interconnection between areas and networks as an  \n\nimportant factor in rural development.  \n\nNetwork activity in rural areas of Wales (United Kingdom) increased economic activities \n\nand sustainability at a local level (Day, 1998). Murdoch (2000) noted that the network  \n\napproach in rural areas as a new paradigm of rural development is useful because it links \n\ntogether the development issues which are internal to rural areas with problems and  \n\nopportunities that are external.  \n\nAustralia\u2019s rural areas, with the intention of solving challenges in social, economic and  \n\nenvironmental terms (irrigation and dryland salinity, soil erosion, soil acidity, water quality, \n\nand pest animals and plants), established local networks named the Landcare Network, \n\nHolbrook Network and Woady-Yaloak Network. For the purpose of improving network  \n\nactivity each network tries to apply a strategy. For instance, the Landcare Network fosters \n\nnew ways of communicating across the area. Moreover, the Holbrook Network opened a \n\ntourist information centre in the main street to facilitate the exchange of information about \n\nLandcare issues in the district. The Woady-Yaloak Network also organizes bus tours for \n\nvisiting groups such as schools, universities, agency staff, sponsors and politicians. In  \n\naddition, the networks increased the effectiveness of volunteers in rural areas (Sobels et \n\nal., 2001).  \n\nThe Schist Villages Program (Portugal) was implemented in 2001 by the Commission for \n\nCoordination and Regional Development Centre (CCDRC). This program involved twenty \n\nfour villages and was aimed at rural development. Regarding this, they established a local \n\nnetwork, rural accommodation, and designed a logo for use with local products. Organiz-\n\ning tours, preparing a calendar and opening a shop \u201cLoja do Xisto\u201d (for supplying local \n\nproducts) were other activities for local development through tourism (Ag\u00eancia Desen-\n\nvolvimento Tur\u00edstico, 2008).   \n\nAccording to Lee et al. (2005) the results of a European pilot project in rural areas of six \n\ndifferent countries: Finland, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Scotland and Sweden, illustrated that \n\nfostering networks can have long-term beneficial results. Indeed, networks create oppor-\n\ntunities for learning and local development (High et al., 2005).  \n\nHigh et al. (2005) believed that an informal structure in terms of networks and communi-\n\nties can be a strategy in rural development.    \n\nIt can be said that the creation of networks is an important factor in rural tourism develop-\n\nment. Engaging local communities in network activities can develop new products and \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n82 \n\nservice innovation as well as the generation of new social economic and intangible capital \n\nthat can lead to a regional competitive advantage (Hall, 2005).  \n\nBased on the results of Romeiro and Costa (2010) in the Valle del Jerte (Spain) a rural \n\ntourism network helps to maximize the sustainability of employment and stimulate proc-\n\nesses of social innovation. Furthermore, local networks contribute to the development of \n\nrural areas.  \n\nIn the last decade, the establishment of three formal social-scientific networks (the Global \n\nGeoparks Network, the European Geoparks Network, and the Asia Pacific Geoparks  \n\nNetwork) are a novel paradigm for rural development.  \n\nAccording to Zouros (2004) and Zouros and McKeever (2009) the European Geoparks \n\nNetwork was set up by four regions located in rural areas of different European Countries \n\n\u2013 France, Germany, Spain, and Greece \u2013 to reduce problems such as slow economic  \n\ndevelopment, unemployment, and a high level of emigration. After that in 2004, the Global \n\nGeoparks Network was set up.  \n\nBoth networks aim at popularizing geology, developing the local economy, exchanging \n\ninformation, sustaining cultural identity and preserving geological and biological heritage.  \n\nApart from the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network (GGN), European Geoparks Network \n\n(EGN), and Asia Pacific Geoparks Network (A.P.G.N) activities, some countries such as \n\nJapan, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and China have developed national and \n\nlocal geopark networks to create close collaboration between geoparks and tourism  \n\nsectors, schools, universities, and businesses. The establishment of the German \n\nGeoparks Network, Italian National Geoparks Forum, Ireland Geoparks Forum and \n\nGreece National Geoparks Forum are examples of network activities in geopark territories \n\non a smaller scale \u2013 country scale \u2013 which follow the rules of, and provide assistance to, \n\nthe continental networks that nowadays constitute the Global Geoparks Network.  \n\nRecently, the Taiwan Geopark Network was set up to promote the concept of geoparks, to \n\nexchange the experience of management of the sites and to educate visitors to protect the \n\nlandscape for the purpose of sustainable development and promoting economic activities \n\n(Lin, 2011).   \n\nThus, it can be said that the European Geopark Network and the UNESCO Global \n\nGeoparks Network introduced the network concept to geo-sciences and geotourism. The \n\nestablishment of geopark networks enables the exchange of ideas, experiences, and best \n\npractices, thereby helping each other to fulfil their common goals: conservation of natural, \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n83 \n\ngeological and cultural heritage, education, and development of the local economy \n\nthrough geotourism. \n\nMoreover, national and local networks not only provide an opportunity for exchange of \n\nknowledge, but also encourage the locals and private sectors to participate in geopark  \n\nactivities. \n\nWhereas the private sector and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in villages \n\nsuch as family businesses only undertake innovation if it promises to be profitable, \n\nGeopark Networks provide opportunities and possibilities for rural small and medium-sized \n\nenterprises (SMEs) to apply innovation. For instance, if a local businessperson or  \n\nproducer joins the geopark local network as an open economy model, she/he can take \n\nadvantage of the recommendation of geopark authorities for creative innovation, together \n\nwith the usage of the geopark brand for local products which are related to geopark activi-\n\nties, besides the possibility of being introduced to other geopark markets, at a national and \n\ninternational level. Furthermore, under the umbrella of the network, local businesspeople \n\nbecome stronger and more profitable. They also become eager to apply innovation. \n\nGeoparks as new tourism destinations, through promoting geotourism and applying initia-\n\ntives under the umbrella of Networks (Global Geoparks Network, European Geoparks \n\nNetwork, National and Local Geoparks Networks) try to popularize geological sciences, \n\nrevive traditional culture, and promote local development (Farsani et al., 2010).     \n\n \n\n2.14.  Summary and Conclusions \n\nBased on the results of literature review, geoparks and geotourism are new recent  \n\nsubjects, so geopark activities have not been studied thoroughly yet. This study tries to  \n\nintroduce geoparks as new tourism destinations.  \n\nAccording to the literature reviews geoparks follow three targets (education, conservation \n\nand geotourism) and innovative strategies are key factors to attain these goals (Figure \n\n2.18).    \n\nAs Figure 2.18 illustrates geomorphological and geological assets can also have a socio-\n\neconomic value if they can be used for geotourism purposes. Nowadays, creation of \n\ngeoparks not only preserves geo-heritage but promotes the local economy through geot-\n\nourism as a niche market.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism \n\n84 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.18- The summary diagram of geopark activities (Source: own construction)  \n\n \n\nGeotourism is one of the core activities of geoparks which are under the umbrella of geo-\n\ngraphic tourism.

Moreover, geoparks are pioneers in the development of geot-\n\nourism; they strive to stimulate socioeconomic activities and sustainable development by \n\nattracting an increasing number of visitors.

The aim of the research is to assess innovative strategies of geoparks to improve \n\ngeotourism as a gateway for the local development in rural areas. \n\nThis chapter starts with the hypotheses, followed by the specification of methodological \n\nprocedures suggested for testing them (Figure 3.1). Moreover, this chapter presents some \n\nconsiderations on selecting international data (section 3.5.1), followed by the local data \n\ncollection and analysis (section 3.5.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1- Stages of the research process (Source: own construction) \n\n 1.

Research Methods for Leisure and Tourism \n\nThere are essentially three main styles of research in the social sciences that researchers \n\nin leisure and tourism can call upon and use (Finn et al., 2000). \n\nThe survey method depends on a sample of respondents replying to a number of ques-\n\ntions that have been previously determined as related to the research. By using the same \n\nquestions for the selected sample of respondents, individuals in the sample may be com-\n\npared. Data can be collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire or a self-\n\ncompletion questionnaire. Surveys have the most important advantage of collecting a lot \n\nof information in a relatively short period of time. The survey can be used deductively by \n\ntesting hypotheses, or inductively by looking for patterns in the data. It is the most  \n\ncommon type of research style used by researchers in leisure and tourism.  \n\nThe experimental method is less common in leisure and tourism research. Ethnographic \n\nresearch involves a method of investigation where a culture is observed in its natural  \n\nsetting. Ethnographers study the complexity of social interaction as indicated in daily life \n\n(Finnet al., 2000).  \n\nThis study focuses on the survey method in the format of a case study. The case study \n\nmethod is one of several ways of doing social science research. The type of research \n\nquestions posed plays an important role in selecting a method. In general, case studies \n\nare the preferred strategy when \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d questions are being posed. It is noteworthy \n\nthat a basic categorization scheme for the types of questions is the familiar series: \u201cwho\u201d, \n\n\u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhere\u201d, \u201chow\u201d, and \u201cwhy\u201d (Yin, 2003).  The main question of the study presented \n\nin this survey is how geoparks and geotourism can contribute in sustainable tourism. As \n\n\u201chow\u201d questions were designed in research questions, the case study method was  \n\nselected for this thesis. This survey tries to explore the policies and new strategies (inno-\n\nvation) pursued by the local government of geoparks in achieving the goals of sustainable \n\ntourism for locals in rural areas. \n\n \n\n3.3.  Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses Development  \n\n3.3.1.  Theory Justification and Applicability \n\nTheory is applied as a guiding framework to help make clear and explain the research \n\nfindings, and indicate the types of conditions under which the research has occurred. \n\nThus, theory is a conceptual framework to help make sense of the research findings (Finn \n\net al., 2000).    \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n89 \n\nBased on the literature review in previous chapter, the UNESCO declaration on geoparks \n\nas a new model of sustainable development and protection of nature has highly evolved \n\nthe strategy of local communities\u2019 participation in protected and natural areas. It is stated \n\nthat a geopark should aim for the development of the local territory and support local \n\ncommunities and products. Local communities should not be removed from the lands \n\nwhere they live, since the locals\u2019 knowledge, traditional arts and traditional style of life play \n\na vital role in geopark management. \n\nGeoparks and geotourism aim to develop the local economy in rural areas. According to \n\nMcKeever and Zouros (2005) geotourism and geoparks claim to promote the local econ-\n\nomy by sustainable tourism. Moreover, Zouros (2004) noted that the European Geoparks \n\nNetwork was established for solving problems such as slow economic development,  \n\nunemployment, and a high level of emigration in rural areas of four countries (France, \n\nGermany, Spain, and Greece). Since local communities in rural areas are compatible with \n\nlocal custom and natural resources, for developing tourism, officials should pay particular \n\nattention to sociocultural and socio-environmental impacts of tourism on local communi-\n\nties. Regarding this, the author built a research question\u2013How can geoparks and  \n\ngeotourism contribute in sustainable tourism?\u2013to find out the policies and innovative \n\nstrategies pursued by local government of geoparks in achieving goals of sustainable tour-\n\nism for locals in rural areas. The empirical study\u2013through sending electronic question-\n\nnaires to all geoparks around the world\u2013strives to highlight the role played by geoparks for \n\nthe conservation of natural heritage, development of the local economy and sociocultural \n\nsustainability in surrounding villages of geoparks. In addition, interviewing local communi-\n\nties in Qeshm Geopark (Iran) reveals the local communities\u2019 ideas about geotourism  \n\nexpansion and establishment of a geopark in their territory.  \n\n \n\n3.3. 2.  Motivation and Objectives \n\nArising from a personal interest in geology and geomorphology, this study was conducted \n\nafter a realisation of the potential of geoparks as new geotourism destinations. \n\nIndeed, very few people know or show interest in our geological heritage, and the fact that \n\nbefore establishing geoparks these potentials were not being developed or optimally  \n\nutilised. This research tries to discover and to introduce innovative strategies which \n\ngeoparks, as a model of sustainable development in protected areas, have applied for \n\npromoting geotourism, reducing the negative impacts of tourism on sociocultural compo-\n\nnents of local communities, conserving natural heritage, and developing the local econ-\n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n90 \n\nomy in geopark territories. Lastly, the author would like to introduce geoparks and geo-\n\nlogical heritage as sustainable tourism destinations. The aims of the research and the key  \n\nresearch questions are illustrated in Figure 3.2. \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2- Objectives and key research questions (Source: own construction) \n\n \n\n3.3.3. Hypotheses \n\nA hypothesis is an unsure statement that proposes a possible explanation for some  \n\nphenomenon or event and a useful hypothesis can include a forecast. Pizam (2005) noted \n\nthat hypotheses are important, indispensable and powerful tools of scientific research. \n\nHowever, there are many things in the research that are not fully understood; hypotheses \n\ntry to make them clear. For example the literature reviews in previous chapter  \n\nillustrated that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n\n \nResearch \n\nQuestion \nSub-Research Questions Specific Objectives \n\nInternational Level \n\nWhat are the policies and new strategies \n(innovation) pursued by local govern-\nment of geoparks in achieving the goals \nof sustainable tourism for locals in \ngeopark territories? \n\nLocal Level \n\nHow can \ngeoparks and \ngeotourism \ncontribute in \nsustainable  \n\ntourism? \n\nWhat are the policies and new strategies \n(innovation) pursued by local govern-\nment of the Qeshm Geopark in achiev-\ning the goals of local development? \n\nTo improve geotourism \nactivities in geopark \n\nTo identify the strategy for \ngeotourism activities \n\nTo improve local economy  \n\nTo identify the role played by \ngeoparks to improve the \nliving conditions of local \npopulation \n\nTo engage local communi-\nties in geotourism and \ngeopark activities \n\nTo evaluate the role played \nby tourism in achieving \nbetter quality of life and \neducation for local popula-\ntion and stimulating eco-\nnomic growth \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n91 \n\n(UNESCO) introduced geoparks as a sustainable development model for participating  \n\nlocal communities in geopark activities. Thus, the following hypotheses (Table 3.1) were \n\nbuilt to highlight the role played by geoparks for the local development in rural areas and \n\ngeopark territories.   \n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Hypotheses (Source: own construction) \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn order to test hypotheses two techniques were used. Firstly, two questionnaires were \n\ndesigned, one for local authorities of geoparks around the world and another for local \n\ncommunities of the surrounding villages of the Qeshm Geopark as a case study.  \n\nAccording to Almeida (2010) existence of a clear connection between hypotheses, ques-\n\ntions and corresponding sections in the literature review can be a good strategy for mate-\n\nrialization of research investigation.  \n\nThus, the second technique (Table 3.2) was designed for creating a connection between \n\nhypotheses, sections and questions. \n\nHypotheses \n\nH1: Geoparks involve local communities in conservation activities \n\nH2: Geoparks have positive socio- environmental impacts on local communities   \n\nH4: Using geotourism can be a useful strategy for developing tourism in geoparks \n\nH5: Geoparks contribute to promoting regional geotourism products and local products \n\nH6: Geoparks promote geotourism through innovative strategies  \n\nH3: Geotourism activities in geoparks create opportunities for local development  \n\nH7: Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employment of \nlocal communities in rural areas and geopark territories \n\nH8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism \nperceived by local communities  \n\nH9: Geoparks do not function similarly in terms of management  \n\nH10: Network activity in the EGN is stronger than in the GGN \n\nH11: The majority of collaboration in GGN and EGN is concentrated in the field of \nexchange of knowledge and knowledge transfer  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n92 \n\nTable 3.2- Connection between hypotheses, questions and corresponding sections \n(Source: own construction) \n\n \nHypotheses Questions Sections \n\nH1: Geoparks involve \nlocal communities in \nconservation activities \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nH2: Geoparks have \npositive socio-\nenvironmental im-\npacts on local com-\nmunities  \n\n \n\n \n\nSocio-Environmental sustainability \n\nRelated interview questions at international level  \n\n\u2022 Does conservation of the geopark improve the local \neconomy?

Description of the Techniques for Leisure and Tourism \n\n3.4.1.  Quantitative and Qualitative Research  \n\nAt one level it is very easy to make a distinction between quantitative and qualitative  \n\nresearch. Denzin and Lincoln (1994) noted that qualitative researchers believe that rich \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n95 \n\ndescriptions of the social world are valuable, whereas quantitative researchers are less \n\nconcerned with such detail. The quantitative paradigm has been the main and accepted \n\nresearch tradition in many fields of leisure and tourism.  \n\nAccording to Finn et al., (2000) quantitative research is classified as an empirical research \n\nwhere the data are in the form of numbers, and qualitative research where the data are \n\nnot in the form of numbers. The quantitative technique is a rigorous scientific method and \n\nthe qualitative research is less rigorous and employs more flexible tools of investigation.  \n\nIn addition, quantitative researchers can reach large numbers of people by clarifying real-\n\nity, whereas qualitative researchers deal with the complexity of reality but with more  \n\nlimited numbers. The difference between qualitative and quantitative research is demon-\n\nstrated in Table 3.3.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 -Difference between qualitative and quantitative research \n\n(Source: Winchester, 2000) \n\nQualitative method Quantitative method \nQualitative data Quantitative data \n\nNatural setting  Experimental setting \n\nSearch for meaning Identification of behaviour \n\nReflection of natural sciences Adoption of natural resources \n\nInductive approach Deductive approach \n\nIdentification of cultural patterns Pursuance of scientific laws \n\nIdealist perspective Realist perspective \n\n \n\nHasse (2001) focused on community participation and stakeholder collaboration in tourism \n\nplanning. In his study, data analysis was used by combining methods, firstly the qualitative \n\nanalysis computer software package NVivo was utilised to systematize the grounded  \n\ntheory. Secondly, the quantitative method was applied to analyse the questionnaires of \n\nthe community and visitor survey by means of software program Excel. The third part of \n\nthe analysis was the design of PAGIS to represent the spatial data collected.  \n\nIn the present thesis in order to increase the validity of the research, the data analysis was \n\nalso carried out by means of the NVivo software. The qualitative software NVivo is a  \n\nuseful tool for performing qualitative researches. It is used in this study to analyse the \n\nopen questions. These open questions introduce the strategies for the conservation of \n\ngeoparks.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n96 \n\nStone (2002) through qualitative analysis sought to assess the current status of ecotour-\n\nism at two destinations where it is being promoted as a regional development strategy. \n\nTwo National Parks (Jianfengling and Diaoluoshan National Forest Parks, in Hainan Prov-\n\nince, China) were selected for his investigation. Finally, ecotourism has been identified as \n\nan important provincial strategy for balancing economic growth and conservation in two \n\ncase studies.   \n\nLepp (2004) by using a qualitative method in his thesis attempted to determine the impact \n\nof tourism in Bigodi (East Africa); Bigodi village is located next to Kibale National Park. \n\nResidents identified several benefits of tourism: money, improved agricultural markets, \n\ncommunal benefits and the idea that tourism benefits can arrive by chance. \n\nAs mentioned in Figure 3.2 one of the aims of the present study is to identify the role of \n\ngeoparks in socioeconomical sustainability in rural areas.   \n\nThe thesis of Saule (2004) is based on in-depth interviews with representatives of tourism \n\nservice suppliers and local tourism and development agents. The goal of the aforemen-\n\ntioned research is to find out how tourism can be used as a tool for local  \n\ndevelopment. Aside from qualitative analysis, the SWOT method was used to determine \n\nthe strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the territory that can have an  \n\ninfluence on tourism in Haute-Corr\u00e8ze (France).  \n\nWith SWOT analysis, experiences gained from different geoparks, and the results of  \n\ndescriptive analysis helped the present thesis to recommend new strategies which  \n\nreduce the negative impacts of tourism in the Qeshm Geopark territory, Iran.  \n\nAfter gaining experiences from geoparks around the world by means of a literature review \n\nand questionnaires, in order to promote better management of the Qeshm Geopark (Iran), \n\nas a case study, the SWOT analysis method used.  \n\nA Yellow Card was issued for the Qeshm Geopark activities illustrating that the Qeshm \n\nGeopark activities are not sufficient. SWOT analysis method was used to investigate the \n\nStrengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of the Qeshm Geopark. Lastly, \n\nSWOT matrices were designed for geosites, ecological-sites, and cultural and archaeo-\n\nlogical heritage sites of the Qeshm Geopark.  \n\nHunter (2006) used a qualitative-interpretive paradigm to investigate the transference of \n\nsustainable tourism theory to practice by examining the extent to which the sustainable \n\ntourism planning philosophy is utilised in the planning practices of local tourism destina-\n\ntions in Queensland (Australia). Moreover, the study developed a theoretical framework to \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n97 \n\nfacilitate the application of sustainability principles to local tourism destination planning. \n\nThe findings illustrated in all cases investigated that the local government was also the \n\ndriver of the planning process, and as such responsible for the fact that sustainability prin-\n\nciples did not support the process. While studies have discussed the fact that sustainabil-\n\nity depends on the agendas of stakeholders, particularly the local government, this study \n\nhas added the idea that due to local governments\u2019 considerable influence, the adoption of \n\nsustainability principles is also linked to the concept of power. The study therefore adds a \n\nfurther dimension to the sustainable tourism debate, that stakeholder influence and power \n\ncan be the determining factor in the adoption of a sustainable approach to tourism  \n\nplanning. \n\nWith regard to the role of the local government as a determining factor in implementation \n\nof principles of sustainable tourism, in this study a questionnaire was designed for local \n\ngovernments of geoparks to seek geopark strategies for sustainable tourism.  \n\nSchellhorn (2007) by using combined methods (qualitative and quantitative) examined the \n\neffectiveness of tourism as an agent of rural development, focusing on culture and nature-\n\nbased destinations in the \u2018developing world\u2019. The study was carried out in the village of \n\nDesa Senaru at Gunung Rinjani National Park in Lombok Island, Indonesia. Based on the \n\nresults, an increased quality of life the village of Desa Senaru depends on a healthy envi-\n\nronment, and hence requires a light ecological footprint. By reducing dependency on \n\nscarce resources, integrated development supports bio-diversity conservation. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that some questions in this study strive to draw attention to the role \n\nplayed by geoparks for minimization of negative environmental impacts of tourism in the \n\nsurrounding villages of geoparks.  \n\nJiang (2008) chose a qualitative method for collecting data; the study was conducted in \n\nTengtou village, China, and she attempted to investigate the role of active involvement of \n\nlocal people at different levels of ecotourism. Her findings illustrated that involvement of \n\nlocal people is an important factor in sustainable development.  \n\nFurthermore, Schweinsberg (2009) applied combined methods (qualitative and quantita-\n\ntive) to assess the role of tourism as an agent of sustainable change in rural Australia. \n\nBased on the findings of his thesis, tourism sustainability in forest regions of Australia  \n\ndepends on the appreciation of local participation.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n98 \n\nRegarding the key role of the local involvement, this thesis is specifically concerned with \n\nthe effect of establishment of geoparks on the participation of local communities in \n\ngeopark activities.  \n\nBoley (2009) by using Geographic Information System (GIS) and reviewing the quantita-\n\ntive methods utilized in designing the survey instrument, pilot testing the instrument, col-\n\nlecting the data, and analysing the results strived to introduce a geotourism map guide as \n\na new educational tool for guiding geotravellers in the region of northwest Montana, \n\nsouthwest Alberta, and southeast British Columbia. The purpose of this study was to take \n\nthe definition of geotourism provided by National Geographic and create a reliable and \n\nvalid instrument capable of measuring geotouristic tendencies. \n\n \n\n3.4.2. Combined Methods \n\nQuantitative research is related with the hypothetico-deductive method of theory testing, \n\nand the qualitative method tries to find models in the data to inductively generate theory; \n\nbut this is not set in stone. Methods using quantitative data can be used to generate  \n\nhypotheses and develop theory, and qualitative research can be used to test hypotheses. \n\nTherefore, some research questions may demand qualitative data, others quantitative or a \n\ncombination of the two.  \n\nFinn et al., (2000) argued that combining qualitative and quantitative technique can maxi-\n\nmise the strengths and minimise the weaknesses of each method.  \n\nThus, in this study a combined method was used to determine the role of the establish-\n\nment of geoparks for local development. Apart from the qualitative and quantitative meth-\n\nods, the SWOT method was used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, \n\nand Threats involved in the Qeshm Geoprak as a case study.  \n\nThe social network analysis technique is another method used to examine the connection \n\nbetween members of UNESCO Global Geoparks Network (GGN) and European \n\nGeoparks Network (EGN).  For visualisation relationships and clusters, the Pajek program \n\nwas used.  \n\nBatagelj and Mrvar (1998) developed Pajek (http://pajek.imfm.si/doku.php?id=pajek) as a \n\nprogram for large network analysis. They addressed that supporting abstraction by factori-\n\nzation of a large network into several smaller networks. Providing the user with some \n\npowerful visualisation tools and implementing a selection of efficient algorithms for  \n\nanalysis of large networks are the main goals in the design of Pajek.   \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n99 \n\nScott and Cooper (2007) by using network analysis in the Pajek program succeeded in \n\nunderstanding the structure of the Australian tourism industry in two states and five  \n\nregions; also they identified product clusters in the network. \n\nIn addition, Baggio et al. (2007) ran a project on the Island of Fiji and the Island of Elba in \n\nItaly to find out how network thinking can inform our understanding of interactions between \n\ntourism operators within a destination. In addition, the research discussed the use of the \n\nscience and tools of network thinking to examine the structural properties of the network of \n\nhyperlinks between the websites of tourism operators in two destinations. In this regard \n\nthe World Wide Web (WWW) is used to follow links from one page to another. Network \n\nanalysis was applied in this study, and the results revealed the poor connectivity among \n\nthe elements of the network.    \n\nCosta and Baggio (2009) reported a complex network- based systematic analysis of Elba \n\n(Italy) as a tourism destination. The Network Analysis method was used to calculate \n\nmeasurements. The results illustrated that the Elba network could benefit from increased \n\nintegration.   \n\nPiao et al. (2010) used Pajek to visualise the agent relationships in the e-commerce \n\ntransaction network as well. \n\n \n\n3.5.  Data Collection  \n\nThe research methodology includes both primary and secondary research. The first phase \n\nconsists of an extensive literature review of existing reports on geotourism and geoparks.  \n\nExcluding the book of Newsome and Dowling (2010) titled \u201cgeotourism: the tourism of \n\ngeology and landscape\u201d the other books paid more attention to geological features in \n\ngeoparks. But the aforementioned book brings together a range of geotourism case  \n\nstudies from a number of countries and highlights the geopark activities and the role of \n\ngeotourism for local development.  \n\nThe results of literature reviews and searching in scientific databases and Google Scholar \n\ndemonstrate that the topic is new and geoparks and geotourism are a new subject  \n\nrecently, so geopark activities have not been studied thoroughly yet. Hence, data for this \n\nresearch was obtained from questionnaires.   \n\nQuantitative research as a hypothetico-deductive method testing is the main technique in \n\nthis survey. A questionnaire-based survey in face-to-face format at the local level in order \n\nto interview local communities of the Qeshm Geopark and an e-survey at international \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n100 \n\nlevel for the purpose of data gathering from the authorities of geoparks registered in \n\nUNESCO Global Geoparks Network were used.  \n\nAn e-survey as a new category of questionnaire-based surveys (mail) emerged via the \n\ninternet (Veal, 2006). In a second phase, the author focused on geoparks registered in \n\nUNESCO and on comprehensive collected information about geoparks and their strate-\n\ngies to improve geotourism and the development of the local communities, by sending \n\nelectronic questionnaires to all geoparks. The questionnaire was completed using a \n\nWORD-processor and e-mailed back to the researcher. The empirical part of the second \n\nphase was conducted from March 2009 to January 2010.  \n\nSince network activity is an innovation in geopark management, another electronic ques-\n\ntionnaire was sent to geoparks to find out fields of collaboration between geoparks. The \n\ndata for this part of research were gathered from October to November 2010.   \n\nA questionnaire-based survey in face-to-face format (household survey and street survey) \n\nat local level was the third step for considering the role of geoparks for promotion of geot-\n\nourism and the local economy. Data for the third part were collected from July to August \n\n2009.  \n\nThe statistical results in both levels were analysed by statistical survey in SPSS tool.   \n\nBeside SPSS, some of the open questions were analysed by means of the qualitative \n\nsoftware NVivo. Moreover, Pajek software was used for visualization of collaboration  \n\nbetween geoparks. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that, beside the primary data, visitor numbers of geoparks as sec-\n\nondary data was used in this research.  \n\n \n\n3.5.1. Selection of the International Data \n\nObservation was the first technique applied to gather information about the role of creation \n\nof geoparks for local development. Regarding this, three field trips were organized around \n\nthe Qeshm, Arouca, and Naturtejo Geoparks.   \n\nIn addition, interviews provide an opportunity for detailed investigation of each individual\u2019s \n\npersonal perspective and for an in-depth understanding of the personal context within \n\nwhich the research phenomenon is found (Creswell, 2003). For better management of the \n\ncase study the authors needed to get experiences from all geoparks around the world, \n\nsince, as geopark and geotourism are new concepts, there were not enough related refer-\n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n101 \n\nences. Also travelling to all geoparks was time consuming. Therefore two questionnaires \n\nwere designed using a word-processor to attain the innovative strategies in geoparks to \n\npromote geotourism, cultural sustainability, natural conservation and socioeconomic  \n\nactivities.  \n\nTo reach these goals in the first step the author will focus on geoparks registered in \n\nUNESCO and comprehensive collected information (by sending electronic questionnaires \n\nto all geoparks around the world (64) in 2009) (Appendix1) (Figure 3.3, and 3.4).  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3- Modelling of phase 1 and 2 of methodology (Source: own construction) \n\nThe questionnaire was distributed to get information about geopark activities and their \n\nstrategies to improve geotourism and the local development.  \n\n \n\nSending electronic  \n\nquestionnaires to all (64) \n\ngeoparks in 2009 \n\nLiterature reviews of geoparks \n\nregistered in GGN \n\nCollecting samples from 25 \n\ngeoparks which replied  \n\nRandom sampling from all \n\ngeoparks registered in GGN \n\nStatistical Survey \n\nT\no find\n\ninnovative strategies\n\nT\no find new\n\n job opportunities\n\nT\no introduce new\n\n tourism\n facilities\n\nT\no introduce new\n\n w\nays to boost tourism\n\n in geoparks \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n103 \n\nlishing a local network for collaboration of geoparks, the author believes that the result of \n\nsampling can be generalized to all geoparks.  \n\nAttention should be drawn to the fact that all countries except China filled in the first ques-\n\ntionnaires. Thus, if from a statistical point of view we exclude the Chinese geoparks (n=22) \n\nfrom the population (N=64), we end up with 42 geoparks registered in UNESCO.

Besides this, this part reveals the role of cooperation in geopark activities.  \n\nPerales (2002) noted that El Alto Palancia, within the Valencian region, using two brands, \n\nnot only promotes environmental quality but also searches for the authentic in  \n\norder to develop modern rural tourism. Moreover, Cai (2002) introduced privileges and \n\nimmunities of cooperative branding, and illustrated that cooperative branding removes the \n\nlimitation of geographic names related to individual cities and towns. Likewise, rural com-\n\nmunities can especially benefit from cooperative branding. Rural tourism marketing \n\nthrough cooperative branding tries to promote individual rural communities and to increase \n\nthe use of tourism resources and synergizing drawing power of their attractions. Conse-\n\nquently, brand marketing is indispensable in rural tourism (Yu-quan, 2007).  \n\nThe European Geoparks Network and the Global Geoparks Network adapted a common \n\nlogo. The members of networks can use the logos for their activities, publications or prod-\n\nucts related to geopark activities (Zouros and Mckeever, 2009).    \n\nIt is evident from the literature review that rural tourism benefits from brand and logo  \n\npromotion. Since, the majority of geoparks are located in the rural areas; questions 6 to 8 \n\ninvestigate the role of a geopark brand for development of the local economy and geotour-\n\nism marketing.  \n\nQuestions 9 to 12 aim at evaluating the role of geoparks for developing the local economy. \n\nThese questions have three major purposes. Firstly, they want to demonstrate the effects \n\nof the creation of geoparks on promoting local crafts and products. It is worth mentioning \n\nthat regional products and handicrafts are cultural identities and promoting them can be a \n\nstrategy for sociocultural sustainability.  \n\nSecondly, these questions attempt to ascertain the role of geotourism marketing in the \n\nlocal economy in geoparks. Lastly, question 12 deals with entrepreneurship, in the form of \n\nseasonal and second job opportunities for local communities in geoparks.  \n\nQuestions 13 to 15 investigate the participation of local communities in geoparks conser-\n\nvation activities. Questions 16 to 20 evaluate whether geotourism can be a useful strategy \n\nfor developing tourism in geoparks?  \n\nAs education and exchange of knowledge are targets of establishment of geoparks, ques-\n\ntions 21 to 23 were designed to evaluate how geoparks, through organizing workshops, \n\nimprove the local economy and increase public awareness of tourists and local communi-\n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n108 \n\nties about cultural identities and geological knowledge. It goes without saying that each \n\neducational activity follows the local development.  \n\nTo give a more detailed description of the connection between questions and the main \n\ntext of the thesis, table 3.5 was designed.  \n\nTable 3.5 -Connection between questions of questionnaire and main text, at international level \n\n(Source: own construction) \n\n  \n\nQuestions  Sections \n\nQ1: How is the management structure of geoparks in your coun-\ntry? \n\n \n\n4.2.1.3.1; 4.2.1.5.3.1;4.2.1.5.3.2; \n\nQ2: Which organizations financially support the geopark in your \ncountry? \n\n4.2.1.3.1; \n\nQ3: Does the geopark cooperate with other organizations and \ncompanies? \n\n4.2.1.3.1;4.2.1.5.5; \n4.2.1.5.3.1;4.2.1.5.3.2; \n\nQ4: What is the percentage of employees who work in the \ngeopark (full time/ part time) and who pays them? \n\n4.2.1.3.1; \n\nQ5: How many employees of geopark are locals? 4.2.1.3.1; \n\nQ6: Does the geopark have a brand and logo of its own? 4.2.1.3.3; \n\nQ7: Do geotourism markets take any advantage of the geopark \nbrand? \n\n4.2.1.3.3; \n\nQ8: Does brand play a role in development of the local \neconomy? \n\n4.2.1.3.3; \n\nQ9: Does the geopark promote regional food and craft products? 4.2.1.2; 4.2.1.5; 4.2.1.5.1;4.2.1.5.4; \n\nQ10: What efforts are undertaken to create and promote \nregional geotourism products of the geopark? \n\n4.2.1.2; 4.2.1.5; \n4.2.1.5.1;4.2.1.5.2;4.2.1.5.6. \n\nQ11: What efforts are undertaken to promote links between the \ngeopark and the local economy? \n\n4.2.1.3.1;  \n\nQ12: Does your geopark create second job or seasonal jobs for \nlocal communities? \n\n4.2.1.3.1; \n\nQ13: What are the conservation activities in the geopark? 4.2.1.4. 1; 4.2.1.5.2; \n\nQ14: How many people are involved in conservation activities? 4.2.1.4. 2; \n\nQ15: Does conservation of the geopark improve the local econ-\nomy? \n\n4.2.1.3.1; 4.2.1.4.1; 4.2.1.4. 2; \n\nQ16: Does the geopark have close collaboration with the tourism \nsector? \n\n4.2.1.3.2; \n\nQ17: Are visitors beneficial to local businesses in your geopark? 4.2.1.3.2; \n\nQ18: Do you count visitors? 4.2.1.3.2; \n\nQ19: Does your geopark engage locals as guides, park guards, \nor others? \n\n4.2.1.3.2; \n\nQ20: Are local people stakeholders in the tourism sector? 4.2.1.3.2; \n\nQ21: Does the geopark have workshop facilities? 4.2.1.4. 3; \n\nQ22: Are the workshops managed by locals? 4.2.1.3.1;4.2.1.4.3; \n\nQ23: Do the workshops improve the local economy? 4.2.1.4. 3; \n\nQ1: in the second questionnaire: With which geoparks does your \ngeopark collaborate? And in which area? \n\n4.2.1.5.3.1; 4.2.1.5.3.2; \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n109 \n\nThe data (close questions in questionnaires) were analysed using a statistical survey \n\nthrough SPSS tools. In addition, in order to increase the validity of the  \n\nresearch, the data analysis was also carried out by means of the NVivo software. The \n\nqualitative software NVivo is a useful tool for performing qualitative researches. For this \n\nreason, NVivo was used in this study to analyse the open question (What are the conser-\n\nvation activities in the geopark?) of the international questionnaires. This open question  \n\nintroduces strategies for conservation of geoparks. Appling NVivo software is a method to \n\nidentify the key concepts in conservation of geological heritage.  \n\nSince network activity is an innovation management in geoparks, in the next step, another \n\nquestionnaire (Appendix 2) was designed to investigate the network analysis in geoparks. \n\nRegarding this, the questionnaire was mailed to all geoparks around the world in 2010; \n\ndata collection was conducted from October to December. This questionnaire has two \n\nmajor purposes: 1) to determine the collaboration areas in the GGN and EGN as two  \n\nsocial scientific networks, and 2) to measure the degree of collaboration and cooperation \n\namong geoparks as geotourism destinations. \n\nThe number of geoparks registered in GGN was 66 until October 2010.  According to the \n\n9th European Geoparks Network conference in Lesvos Island (Greece) the number of \n\ngeoparks increased to 77 in 24 countries.   \n\nSince data for this part of study was collected over three months (from October to Decem-\n\nber 2010), it is obvious that the former geoparks had no collaboration with the 11 new \n\ngeoparks for these 3 months. Thus we exclude the new geoparks (n=11) from the popula-\n\ntion (N=77), including, however, an aspiring geopark located in China (Hong Kong). This \n\nexception is justified due to the existing collaboration between this geopark and Itoigawa \n\nGeopark in Japan, and Yandangshan Geopark in China. Therefore, we end up with 67 \n\ngeoparks (Figure 3). Nineteen questionnaire responses were received (28%). The majority \n\nof responses were collected in Europe (68%), and the others were from China, Australia, \n\nIran, Malaysia, and Japan (Table 3.6).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n110 \n\nTable 3.6 - Geoparks that replied to the second questionnaire regarding network activity \n\n(2010) \n\n \n\nIn this part, a social network analysis technique also was used to examine the relationship \n\nbetween members of GGN. Analysis of the coded data file was made using the network \n\nrelationship program (Pajek). According to Hu and Racherla (2008), actors or nodes can \n\nbe persons, organizations, or groups, or any other set of related entities. In this research, \n\nthose geoparks registered in GGN are nodes, and relations between actors are depicted \n\nas links between the corresponding nodes.  \n\nRegarding analysis of data in Pajek for numbers of N geoparks, a coded matrix (N\u00d7 N) \n\nwas created in Microsoft Excel, in which the value of 1 indicates collaboration and the \n\nvalue of 0 points to no relationship, and the coded matrix was then imported to a text \n\nNO Country Geopark  \n\n1 Australia Kanawinka Geopark \n\n2 China Leiqiong Geopark \n\n3 China Yandangshan Geopark \n\n4 Croatia PapukGeopark \n\n5 France R\u00e9serveG\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence \n\n6 Germany Vulkaneifel Geopark \n\n7 Germany Swabian Alb Geopark \n\n8 Greece Psiloritis Natural Park \n\n9 Iran Qeshm Geopark \n\n10 Japan Itoigawa Geopark \n\n11 Malaysia Langkawi Geopark \n\n12 Norway Magma Geopark \n\n13 Norway Gea Norvegica Geopark \n\n14 North Ireland Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark \n\n15 Portugal Naturtejo Geopark \n\n16 Portugal Arouca Geopark \n\n17 Romania Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark \n\n18 Scotland, UK Geopark Shetland \n\n19 Spain Sobrarbe Geopark \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n111 \n\ndocument and the file was imported to Pajek software. Finally, the Pajek program pro-\n\nduced a picture of the social relationship network between the interviewed geoparks.  \n\nPajek software was used to visualise the network, and the collaboration situation of each \n\ngeopark was derived from the numbers of links.  \n\nIn addition, the usage of quantitative network parameters is applied to measure the  \n\ndegree of collaboration and cooperation among geoparks as geotourism destinations.   \n\nBesides the coded matrix, another matrix was designed to illustrate the fields of collabora-\n\ntion between geoparks. In this matrix symbols are used to indicate the collaboration areas.  \n\n \n\n3.5.2.  Selection of the Local Data \n\nAs mentioned in the literature review, some authors (Smith, 1989a; Smith, 1989b; \n\nMcKean, 1989; Mansperger, 1995; Brunt and Courtney, 1999; Duxbury et al., 2007; Eraqi, \n\n2007) demonstrated that tourism has consequences for residents, sometimes good and \n\nsometimes bad.  \n\nNowadays geoparks as a new model of sustainable development and protection of nature \n\nstrive to minimize the negative impacts of tourism. Moreover, according to several authors \n\n(Xun and Milly,2002; Xun and Ting, 2003; Zouros, 2004; Nowlan et al., 2004; Turner, \n\n2006; Rodriguse and Carvalho, 2009; Eckhardt, 2009; McKeever et al., 2010) geotourism \n\nas a new economic growth point and new branch of sustainable tourism can improve the  \n\nexpense of geo-heritage preservation, increase local revenues and enhance employment \n\nin geopark territories.  \n\nInterviews at the local level allow us to reveal the significant and tangible effects of the \n\nestablishment of a geopark for the local development.  Regarding this, Qeshm Geopark \n\nwas selected as a case study, and the local communities living in the surrounding villages \n\nof geopark were interviewed. Respondents as host communities indicated their preference \n\nfor tourism expansion and pointed out the role of creation of Qeshm Geopark on the \n\nminimization of negative sociocultural and socio-environmental impacts of tourism in their \n\nterritory. In addition, they draw attention to the role of establishment of Qeshm Geopark \n\nfor development of the local economy.  \n\nThe aim of this part of the study is to identify policies and new strategies (innovation) pur-\n\nsued by the local government of Qeshm Geopark in achieving the goals of local develop-\n\nment. For this purpose, questionnaires with random samples were administered in this \n\nstep. Interviews in face-to-face format at the local level were conducted from July to  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n112 \n\nAugust 2009, and different ways of data gathering were used; regarding this, we travelled \n\nto villages located near the geopark, geosites, handicrafts workrooms, rental houses, and \n\nmuseums; we also distributed 29% of questionnaires in the summer festival annually held \n\nin Qeshm.   \n\nResidents of Qeshm Geopark were interviewed regarding (the affect or the role of) tourism \n\non their community and geopark. According to the Statistical Centre of Iran (2006) the \n\ntotal population of the Qeshm Geopark area is about 17355 people who live in 19 villages. \n\nIn this study locals more than 20 years old were interviewed and finally 720 (8%) ques-\n\ntionnaires were collected (Table 3.7).  \n\n \n\nTable 3.7-The population of residents who replied to the questionnaires \n\nVillage Population 20&lt;percentage of         respondents \n\nSalakh 2281 1163 8.2 \n\nDarkooh 550 280 2.4 \n\nKani 311 159 1.4 \n\nGuri 726 370 2.6 \n\nMoradi 283 144 1.4 \n\nTomgas 162 83 7 \n\nDulab 1125 574 6.0 \n\nKonar Siah 324 165 1.5 \n\nSar Rig 1498 764 7.9 \n\nChahu Gharbi 527 269 2.4 \n\nChahu Sharghi 919 469 5.6 \n\nGambran 436 222 2.4 \n\nTabl 3082 1572 18.1 \n\nMaleki 193 98 1.0 \n\nDoorbani 616 314 2.8 \n\nGuran 1131 577 6.5 \n\nShibderaz 461 235 8.2 \n\nBerkekhalaf 314 160 7.6 \n\nGiahdan 2416 1232 13.5 \n\nTotal 17355 8850 100 \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study \n\n113 \n\nIn the designed questionnaires (Figure 3.8 and Appendix 3) questions 1 to 3 evaluate \n\neconomic problems such as unemployment which the local communities face, questions 4 \n\nand 5 ask the local communities to express their opinion on the development of tourism \n\nand geotourism \u2013as a branch of sustainable tourism\u2013 in their territory. Furthermore, ques-\n\ntions 6 and 7 aim at evaluating the negative social and environmental impacts of tourism \n\non the local communities of Qeshm Geopark. Question 8 inquires into the role played by \n\nlocal government in the preservation of natural heritage. Besides this, questions 9 and 10 \n\nseek to ascertain public awareness of the local communities about geoparks and their \n\nactivities.  \n\nQuestion 11 to 13 include an evolution of environmental, sociocultural and socioeconomic \n\nimpacts of geopark establishment on local communities. Question 13 and 14 were  \n\ndesigned to give a more detailed description of socioeconomic impacts.

For example, a one-sample t-test was used to test the first  \n\nsub-hypothesis.  A one-sample t-test is a statistical procedure that is applied to know the \n\nmean difference between the sample and the known mean value of the population.  \n\nIn this sub-hypothesis we want to calculate the mean difference between the monthly \n\nsalary of the local communities who are involved in Qeshm Geopark activities and the  \n\nNational Minimum Wage rate per month in Iran.  \n\nThe second sub-hypothesis was tested by an independent samples t-test procedure. The \n\nindependent samples (or two-sample) t-test is used to compare the means of two  \n\nindependent groups. In the above mentioned sub-hypothesis the mean revenue of local \n\nmen\u2013from engagement in geopark activities in the form of part time, second or seasonal \n\njobs \u2013was compared with the mean revenue of local women.  \n\nPearson's Chi-square test, which is the best-known of several chi-square tests, was  \n\napplied to test the third sub-hypothesis. This Chi-square test enables us to compare  \n\nobserved and expected frequencies objectively. \n\nSub- Hypotheses\n\nH7: Geoparks contribute to employment of local communities in rural areas and \ngeopark territories  \n\nHNull= Salary of local communities who are involved in geopark activities is equivalent to National \n\nMinimum Wage (NMW) rate (per month):  M1=207 euro \n\nFirst sub-hypothesis for H7: Salary of local communities who are involved in geopark activities is \n\nnot equivalent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate (per month):  M1?207 euro \n\nH7: Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employment of local \ncommunities in rural areas and geopark territories \n\nHNull= Men and women earn equal revenue from geopark activities: M Men = M Women \n\nSecond sub-hypothesis for H7: Men earn more revenue from geopark activities: M Men ?

These matrices recommend \n\nnew strategies which reduce the negative impacts of tourism in the Qeshm territory.

Therefore, the combined method (quan-\n\ntitative and qualitative) was used in this thesis.  \n\nThe major objective of this study is to investigate how geoparks and geotourism can con-\n\ntribute in sustainable tourism. \n\nIn order to highlight the role of geoparks in rural development and achieve the abovemen-\n\ntioned objective, both primary and secondary research was used. In other words, the ba-\n\nsic method is comparison of different geoparks registered in the UNESCO Global \n\nGeoparks Network, to ascertain policies and new strategies (innovation) pursued by the \n\nlocal governments of geoparks in achieving the goals of sustainable tourism for rural de-\n\nvelopment. \n\nRegarding this, three questionnaires were designed: the first and second were filled in by \n\nauthorities of geoparks and the third one was filled in by local communities of the case \n\nstudy (locals who live in the surrounding villages of the Qeshm Geopark).  \n\nAccording to the literature review the thesis topic is new and geoparks and geotourism are \n\na new subject recently; so geopark activities have not been studied thoroughly yet. Hence \n\nsending electronic questionnaires to geoparks around the world can help us to collect \n\nmore information about geopark activities and innovative strategies.  \n\nMoreover, interviews with the local communities of Qeshm Geopark territory create an \n\nopportunity to investigate thoroughly the effect of the establishment of a geopark and  \n\ndevelopment of geotourism on minimization of negative impacts of tourism in rural areas.  \n\nThe local and international data was analysed using SPSS tools, NVivo, and Pajek  \n\nsoftware. \n\nAfter discussing and justifying the methodological choices for this research, the next two \n\nchapters present the results of the empirical studies. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4- Sustainable Tourism in \nUNESCO Global Geoparks Network  \n\n \nPart 1- Geographical Areas where the \n\nEmpirical Study was conducted \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n119 \n\n4.1.1.  Introduction \n\nChapter 4, part 1 explains how geoparks attain their targets. It begins with a glimpse into \n\nthe characterisation of geoparks, where the empirical study is conducted. This part also \n\ncovers the geographical characterizations, innovative strategies, and main activities of the \n\ngeoparks that replied to questionnaires. \n\n  \n\n4.1. 2.  Characterization of the Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\nAs mentioned in chapter 3, two questionnaires were sent to all geoparks around the world. \n\nFirstly, twenty-five questionnaire forms were collected after having been filled in by the \n\nchosen respondents. The majority of responses were from Europe (80%) and the others \n\nfrom Australia, Iran, Malaysia, Japan, and Brazil. This questionnaire evaluated the role of \n\ngeoparks in socioeconomic, socio-environmental and sociocultural sustainability. The \n\nempirical study was conducted from March 2009 to January 2010. \n\nThe second questionnaire, which investigated the area of collaboration between geoparks, \n\nwas conducted from October to November 2010. In this phase nineteen geoparks replied \n\nto the second questionnaire. Once again the majority of responses were from Europe (13 \n\ngeoparks from 10 countries \u2013 France, Portugal, Germany, Greece, Spain, Norway, North \n\nIreland, UK, Romania, and Croatia \u2013 and the others from Australia, Iran, Malaysia, China, \n\nand Japan.     \n\nThis part takes a look at the geoparks where the empirical study was carried out. The \n\ninformation of this part was gathered from a literature review, and the questionnaire filled \n\nin by geopark authorities.   \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.1.  R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence (France)   \n\nR\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence (RGHP) geopark is located in the southeast of \n\nFrance and covers 2100 km2 from Montagne de Chine to the Gorges of Verdon River. The \n\nmain activities are centred on agriculture (sheep-raising, in particular, plays an important \n\npart in landscape conservation) and tourism. The tourism focuses on leisure, nature, and \n\nculture. Moreover, the mineral springs and spa play an important role in Digne-les-Bains \n\ntourist attractions. These two pillars (agriculture and tourism) also support services and \n\ncrafts; but there is no industry in the territory. \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n120 \n\nVisitors can experience 300 million years of the earth\u2019s history in this geopark. Fossils, \n\ntectonic and sedimentary outcrops are geological heritage sites in this area (Unjah, 2008). \n\nIt is notable that France was a member of the 4 countries which announced the geopark \n\nterm as an innovation to improve socioeconomic activities of locals, conservation of geo-\n\nheritage, and popularization of the geosciences. Regarding this, the geopark team \n\nbelieves that the approach to sustainable management can be directed into two paths: \n\nnetwork and initiative. Hence, managers of the geopark try to develop them by \n\nestablishing a good partnership with business entities, libraries, student facilities, farms, \n\ncamping and caravanning sites, hotels, hostels, restaurants, bars, tourism offices, and \n\nnature tour guides. Nature guides are a group of professional local guides that have the \n\nability to describe the rich geological heritage of the area in addition to other heritage.  \n\nTheir vigorously conducted tours range from school children, families, group, associations, \n\nclub, and enterprises to individuals who are interested in the geological heritage. In order \n\nto maintain the standard of scientific information and quality of guides, all guides are \n\nencouraged to take the course with the R\u00e9serve. Recently, 23 active nature guides have \n\njoined the R\u00e9serve Network. The guides and their partners, through an awareness \n\nprogram, have attracted much more tourist attention to this area.  \n\nSeveral initiatives created by their partners, such as creating geo-products (ammonite \n\nchocolate, ammonite bread, and pastries, are among the attractions in Digne les Bains). \n\nGeotourism guide is another innovative activity in this territory (Unjah, 2008).   \n\nAt present, the RGHP geopark is supported by the Ministry of Environment and the local \n\nmunicipality.  \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.2.  Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) \n\nGeopark Naturtejo was the first Portuguese geopark integrated into the European and \n\nGlobal Geopark Networks. It was registered in the Global Geopark Network (GGN) in \n\n2006. Geopark Naturtejo is a vast territory, 4616 km2, covering 6 municipalities (Castelo \n\nBranco, Idanha-a-Nova, Oleiros, Proen\u00e7a-a-Nova, Nisa and Vila Velha de R\u00f3d\u00e3o) which, \n\nto a great degree, financially support it. \n\nAccording to Carvalho and Rodrigues (2010a) the Naturtejo Geopark comprises more \n\nthan 170 geosites identified in the Naturtejo Geopark Geosites Inventory; 1 Natural \n\nMonument (Portas de R\u00f3d\u00e3o); 2 Thermal Springs (Monfortinho and Fadagosa de Nisa), 3 \n\nNatura 2000 Sites (Serra da Gardunha, Nisa/Laje de Prata and S. Mamede), \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n121 \n\ninternationally recognized important Bird Areas, 1 Natural Park (Tejo Internacional), 5 \n\nSchist Villages (Figueira, \u00c1lvaro, Martim Branco, Foz do Cobr\u00e3o and Sarzedas), 2 \n\nHistorical Villages (Monsanto and Idanha-a-Velha), several fortified villages (such as \n\nPenha Garcia, Salvaterra do Extremo, Segura, Montalv\u00e3o, Rosmaninhal, Nisa or Amieira \n\ndo Tejo), more than 30 local to national-importance protected monuments, and several \n\ngeosites already classified as municipal interest. \n\nThe geomorphological, geological, paleontological and mining heritage sites are \n\nmonuments with regional and international geological significance in this area. An \n\nexample is the wonderful exposure of trilobite trace fossils in the Penha Garcia \n\nIchnological Park. Visitors, going to the fossils trail, will directly look at past time windows \n\nopening on the sea bottom of 480 million years ago (Carvalho and Martin, 2007). Portas \n\ndo R\u00f3d\u00e3o and Vale Mour\u00e3o gorges, the Roman gold mine of Conhal do Arneiro, and the \n\ngranite morphologies from Serra da Gardunha and Monsanto are the other geological \n\ntrails in this geopark. There are also granite outcrops such as the inselberg archipelago \n\nand demi-horst with outstanding landforms. \n\nThe geopark is a partnership of municipalities and the local entrepreneurs for developing \n\ninnovative strategies for sustainable development. Geopark officials play a vital role in \n\nconsulting with locals and suggesting innovative ideas to them with the goal of economy \n\nimprovement in geopark territory. Naturtejo Geopark cooperates with private sectors such \n\nas natural spa health centres, foreign and domestic outdoor companies, NGOs (Non-\n\nGovernmental Organization), hotels, restaurants, and family guest houses.  \n\nAn educational program in schools and universities is the next initiative in the geopark. \n\nNaturtejo Geopark started an educational program in 2007 and at the end of 2009 \n\nsucceeded in educating 3813 students and teachers (Catana and Rocha, 2009). In this \n\nprogram age ranges are from 4 to 10 years; this program embraces two educational \n\nactivities including: \u201cSchool Meets the Geopark\u201d and \u201cGeopark Goes to School\u201d. The \n\ngeopark employed local geologists as teachers, regarding the fact that no one knows the \n\ngeopark territory better than locals.  \n\nApart from educational programs, geopark officials attempt to improve socioeconomic \n\nactivities of the local communities by geotourism and new job opportunities such as the \n\nestablishment of a geo-bakery, geo-restaurant, geo-museum, and family guest house and \n\norganization of geo-sports and geotours. \n\nEstablishment of a geo-restaurant and geo-bakery in Naturtejo Geopark is not only \n\ninspired by the landscape but also revived the past civilizations and ancient traditions.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n122 \n\nThe geo-bakery1 is managed by a geologist couple. Geology stimulates the couple\u2019s \n\nparticipation in management, for instance they make trilobite and granulite cookies in the \n\ngeo-bakery, and serve them on tours and at conferences as geo-products. Moreover, they \n\nhave close collaboration with authorities of Naturtejo Geopark and they use the brand of \n\ngeopark for their geo-products. Besides this, the geo-bakery has designed a geo-menu \n\nand serves geo-food. Each pizza in this restaurant has a geographic name, for example \n\nNazca Pizza (an example of a tectonic earth plate). Aside from tectonic pizza, the geo-\n\nbakery make Orogenic Toasts (Cadomian, Variscan and Alpine, representing the major \n\nmountain belt events from Naturtejo Geopark) (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009) (Appendix \n\n4).  \n\nCasa do Forno is not just a geo-bakery alone; it is a family guest house as well. It is \n\nnoteworthy that every room has a geologic name and is decorated with geological \n\nlandscape pictures. Additionally, in the corridors and yards the visitors can see the \n\ncollection of stones and local handicrafts.   \n\nThe establishment of a geo-restaurant2 is another innovation of the geopark. Petiscos e \n\nGranitos restaurant is located in Monsanto village. The restaurant \u201cPetiscos e Granitos\u201d \n\noffers various traditional dishes from the region with a special architecture feature: granite. \n\nPetiscos e Granitos is the first geological restaurant with traditional architecture using big \n\ngranite stones weighing thousands of tons as walls and ceiling. This single area \n\ncelebrates the \u201ckitchen of the Earth\u201d with a geo-menu. This restaurant is a new concept in \n\ncatering, and an educational strategy that promotes the geological Portuguese heritage. \n\nServing Boulder soup or Marble cake in the Petiscos e Granitos geo-restaurant constitutes \n\nother good examples for making geoproducts. Petiscos &amp; Granitos is the first geological \n\nrestaurant which is located in the Naturtejo Geopark territory. The food is served among \n\nboulders of granite caves (the geological architecture of the restaurant) (Appendix 5) \n\n(Rodrigues, 2009). \n\nFurthermore, Carlos Santos, a businessman from Idanha-a-Nova has inaugurated the \n\nsecond geo-restaurant in Naturtejo Geopark. The Carlos Santos Sabores da Terra (Earth \n\nFlavours) geo-restaurant serves traditional recipes combined with local products such as \n\nlocal mushrooms, cheese and olive oil. In addition, geo-food such as Cantchais Lamb \n\n(Cantchais is the local name for granite boulders) is served in this geo-restaurant. The \n\n                                                            \n1 Casa do Forno (http://www.casadoforno.com.pt/)  \n \n2 Petiscos e Granito restaurant  (http://www.georestaurante.net/a5.html)  \n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n123 \n\nmenu of this geo-restaurant is related to local geological landscapes (Naturtejo Geopark \n\nAuthorities, 2010a).  \n\nThe last but not the least innovation in the geopark territory, is the establishment of a \n\nfamily guest house which improves the economy of the local communities, especially \n\nretired people who are alone. There are some family guest houses in Geopark Naturtejo \n\nterritory. S. Torcato-Moradal guest house3 is a famous one which used schist (The Stone \n\nin the area) in its walls and its logo refers to its architecture. This house is managed by a \n\nlocal old couple; they serve traditional food and manage tours for tourists. This family \n\nguest house opened in 2006 and it has 4 rooms. By the end of 2009 this guest house had \n\nserved 500 tourists (Appendix 6). \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.3. Arouca Geopark (Portugal)  \n\nArouca Geopark was the second Portuguese geopark integrated into the European and \n\nGlobal Geopark Networks in 2009. The area of the geopark is around 328 km2 and \n\ncorresponds exactly to the administrative borders of the Arouca municipality with about \n\n25000 inhabitants (Abreu S\u00c1, 2009).  \n\nThere are 41 geosites in Arouca Geopark and the geopark is known for its outstanding \n\ngeological heritage of international significance, with particular emphasis on the largest \n\ntrilobite fossils (Abreu S\u00c1 et al., 2009).  \n\nArouca is officially managed and financially supported by the municipality. Arouca \n\nGeopark cooperates with universities, hotels, museums, restaurants, bungalows, and rural \n\nhotels. In addition to geological heritage, there are natural, architectural, cultural, and \n\nhistorical heritage sites in the geopark. The cultural heritage of Arouca goes back to the \n\nprehistoric times. In this territory, there is mining heritage remaining from the Romans.   \n\nGeopark officials play a vital role in the educational program; at the end of 2009, they had \n\nsucceeded in educating 3956 local pupils and 331 local teachers (Catana and Rocha, \n\n2009). Likewise, the geopark runs an educational project called \u201cGeoteca\u201d; this project, \n\nwas initially developed by the school libraries and the main goal of the project was to \n\nimprove the knowledge of students and teachers about Arouca Geopark (Rocha et al., \n\n2009). In this regard, the geopark held an innovative workshop titled \u201cMake your own \n\n                                                            \n3 S. Torcato-Moradal guest house (http://www.s-torcatomoradal.com/en.htm)  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n124 \n\nTrilobite\u201d; this workshop reinforced the knowledge of the students about trilobite and \n\ngeopark activities; the children painted the trilobites and dressed up as trilobites, and raft \n\nboats in Carnival 2009 (Appendix 7).   \n\nFurthermore, the Arouca Geopark was already well known for its nature sports activities \n\nsuch as rafting, cycling, climbing, and hiking.   \n\nThe Centre for Geological Interpretation of Canelas4 is an innovative local business in \n\nArouca Geopark. This private fossil museum was built by the company Ard\u00f3sias Val\u00e9rio \n\nand Figueiredo, Lda with financial support of the LEADER program. The fossil museum \n\nopened to the public on 1st July 2006, and it offers tours of the interior of rocks formed on \n\nthe sea about 500 million years ago, watching the enigmatic creatures that inhabited it, \n\nwhich include some of the largest and rarest trilobites of the world (Appendix 8). It is \n\nnoteworthy that the fossil museum was a factory in the past, but when the Arouca \n\nGeopark established, it became part of the geopark geo-trail, and now it has a close \n\ncollaboration with geopark. The fossil museum generates income through selling tickets \n\nand holding educational programs for schools. By August 2009, more than 27000 visitors \n\nvisited this site. Indeed, this centre is a private museum and educational centre.  \n\nThe museum has cooperation with local artists; regarding this, they sell and exhibit local \n\nhandicrafts in their museum. Decorative geo-products based on geological elements such \n\nas trilobite clocks, trilobite glasses, trilobite lamp covers, etc. are good examples of geo-\n\nproducts (Appendix 9).   \n\nThe last but not the least innovation in Arouca Geopark is creation of geo-products. \n\nPedras Parideiras (Appendix 10) is a geo-product in Arouca Geopark. Pedras Parideiras \n\nare cookies which have the shape of biotite nodules from local granites. Visitors can find \n\nthese cookies in one of the famous cake shops of Arouca (casa do p\u00e3o de l\u00f3 de Arouca). \n\nPedras Parideiras is a symbol of the Castanheira Nodular Granite, with a phenomenon \n\npopularly known as Pedras Parideiras (rocks that give birth).   \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.4.  Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) \n\nVulkaneifel Geopark with 1250 km2 area is located in the Eifel, Rhenania-Palatinate \n\nregion. This geopark has a fascinating landscape which provides an insight into more than \n\n350 million years of history including the youngest volcanic activity in Germany. Volcanoes \n\n                                                            \n4 The Centre for Geological Interpretation of Canelas (http://www.cigcarouca.com/)  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n125 \n\nare conspicuous; 350 eruption centres have been known up to now, from which this \n\nlandscape received its dominant morphological shaping and the name Vulkaneifel \n\n(Schueller and Bauer, 2004).   \n\nThis geopark was registered in the European Geoparks Network in 2000 and became a \n\nmember of the Global Geoparks Networks in 2004. The local government and private \n\nadministration manage the geopark and 7 municipalities and the business development \n\nagency of county Vulkaneifel financially support it. The geopark cooperates with some \n\nother organizations such as: Eifel tourism GmbH, Tourism agencies at municipalities, and \n\nregional forest administration.  \n\nVulkaneifel Geopark became economically famous for its mineral water resources. Today, \n\nmany volcanologists and geologists as well as environmental scientists and biologists do \n\nresearch here because of the large open pits which give a new dimension to looking into \n\nvolcanological processes and in finding perspectives for sustainable developments ideas.  \n\nVulcaneifel Geopark currently comprises a network of 12 geo-units. Four of them are \n\nmuseums like the Vulcan-museum Daun, the Maar-museum Manderscheid, the Iron-\n\nmuseum Juenkerath, and the Natural-history Museum of Gerolstein.  \n\nThe park includes three existing geo-trails: Geo-Pfad Hillesheim, Geo-Route \n\nManderscheid, and Geopark Gerolstein, each with marked geological outcrops and \n\nlocations on routes around small towns with a large amount of geological information on \n\ninterpretation panels. There is a pool of outdoor information which enables groups to do \n\ntours on their own (EGN, 2005). \n\nIn addition, the Eifel region is a natural area with a unique character, known as an \n\nattractive landscape and region of origin as high-quality products with the new regional \n\nbrand \u201ce\u201d which can be recognized directly by consumers for the special quality of the \n\nEifel.  \n\nIts symbol is the brand logo with a yellow \u201ce\u201d; this brand is a multipurpose brand and is \n\nused for agriculture, forestry, trade, tourism activities, and the local products. Moreover, \n\ngeo-products such as Vulkaneifel mineral water cocktails are innovations for promoting \n\nregional and local products in this geopark.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n126 \n\n4.1. 2.5.  Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita (Germany)  \n\nTERRA vita geopark is located in North-Western Germany in the transitional zone \n\nbetween the northern German lowlands and the north-western hill country, about 100 \n\nkilometres from the North Sea coast and some 35 km east of the Dutch border. With an \n\narea of 1220 km2, the Nature Park is one of the cross-border Parks of the Federal \n\nRepublic of Germany (GGN, 2008a).  \n\nThis park with an area of 901km2 is located in Lower Saxony, in the district of Osnabrueck. \n\nThe rest of the territory, 319 km2, is located in North-Rhine Westfalia in the districts of \n\nMinden-Luebbecke, Herford, Guetersloh, and the city of Bielefeld.  \n\n70% of the Natural Park is covered with forest; the other 30% is mostly used for \n\nagriculture activities (GGN, 2008a). TERRA vita was registered in EGN in 2001, and it is \n\nthe government and private administration who manage the geopark, but 45 local \n\nmunicipalities financially support it. The geopark cooperates with organizations such as: \n\nthe tourism sector, schools, environmental foundations, and diverse institutions of \n\nenvironmental education.  \n\nTERRA vita geopark is the documentation of the earth's history from the carboniferous \n\nage about 300 million years ago up to today, nearly without gaps, in a narrow area in this \n\nregion. One example for an impressive opening in carboniferous rock is the quartzite-\n\nquarry of the \"Piesberg\" north of Osnabruck, housing an industrial-historical museum with \n\nan accessible black coal pit from the 19th century.  \n\nThe dinosaur footprints of Barkhausen in the \"Wiehengebirge\" left by altogether eleven \n\ndinosaurs of two different species appear in the upper Jurassic age and are unique in \n\nEurope. The footprint quarry is the most important geo-site of the nature park (Appendix \n\n11).  \n\nThe Rocks of Dorenthe, which are an outcrop of lower cretaceous sandstone, are another \n\ngeopark geosite; this geosite is a tourist attraction in the western part of the Nature-park. \n\nThe \"Sea of Rocks\" on the \"Gattberg\", including the huge erratic block gives a sense of \n\nthe enormous power of the glaciers that once moved through the Nature-park area. \n\nTERRA vita geopark has an exhibition and facility of two hectares, where visitors are \n\ngiven a geological overall view by the Nature-park team and where educational programs \n\nfor schools are offered. It is a popular excursion destination for scientists from all over \n\nGermany and the Netherlands. A current registration of geotopes completes the scientific \n\nlist of existing geological objects. The main target of the geopark activities is further \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n127 \n\nprotection measures for geotopes together with enlarged public relation activities, allowing \n\nvisitors and also inhabitants a better understanding of the connections of earth history in \n\ndifferent ways. The 1999 extension and development of the Geosite \"Dinosaur Footprints\" \n\ninto an open air museum, was an important step in this direction.  \n\nTouristic offers like thematic bicycle routes, action tours for groups, and thematic maps \n\nare being worked out by the Nature-park administration. In 2004, a set of 17 cycling-routes \n\ncalled \"TERRA. Trails\" was published and a printed guide map for each route provides \n\npublic information for visitors.   \n\n \n\n4.1. 2. 6. Geopark Harz . Braunschweiger Land Ostfalen (Germany)  \n\nHarz Braunschweiger Land Ostfalen is located in Northern Germany and encloses the \n\nHarz Mountains and the northern situated \"Braunschweiger Land\" up to the Flechtingen \n\nRidge. This geopark was registered in EGN in 2002. The whole geopark area is about \n\n10000 km2 and it contains 18 districts in three German federal states. Due to the very \n\nlarge area, the geopark is managed by a committee of two associations (George and \n\nZellmer, 2002): \n\n- The \u201cRegional verb and Harz\" in Quedlinburg is an organisation essentially formed \n\nby the rural districts of the Harz Mountains.  \n\n- The registered society called \"Femo\" (a part of \u201cBraunschweiger Land / Ostfalen). \n\nThe geopark is under the supervision of government and private administration; it is  \n\nfinancially supported by the local municipalities and environment department.  \n\nThe Harz Mountains are composed of Palaeozoic sediments and magmatic rocks. They \n\nhave been extensively documented over the past 1,000 years in historical accounts of \n\nmining and research in the area. And the Harz Mountains are characterized by a \n\ngeographically small-scale occurrence of sedimentary rocks (sandstone, slate, chert, \n\ngreywacke, and reef limestone) as well as igneous rocks (meta-basalts, keratophyre, and \n\ntuffites) (George and Zellmer, 2002). \n\n\u2018The Classic Square Mile of Geology\u2019 is the theme of geopark Harz. Sedimentary, volcanic \n\nand plutonic rocks as well as a complete sequence of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, which \n\nare packed with fossils, can be viewed in this small area (Appendix 12). The above \n\nmentioned name was given to a small area near Goslar town which is visited by \n\nprofessors and students from Germany and all over Europe (George and Zellmer, 2009).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n128 \n\nIn this area visitors can experience geopark attractions either independently or under the \n\nguidance of trained personnel. For this purpose, information booklets and leaflets are \n\navailable, for example the \"Landmarks\", which give an overview of the geology of the Harz \n\nregion. In cooperation with museums and schools, special educational activities are \n\ncontinuously being developed.  \n\nIn the geopark museum there are graphs to explain the geological events that led to the \n\nsensational formations at the northern edge of the Harz Mountains. Rocks as well as ores \n\nand minerals from all eras of the classical square mile are exhibited (EGN, 2009b).  \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.7. Swabian Alb Geopark (Germany)  \n\nThe geopark Swabian Alb which is situated in southwest Germany was registered in EGN \n\nin 2001. The geological structure of this region was shaped by the uplifting of the \n\nmountains of the Black Forest. Consequently, the Mesozoic sediments to the east of these \n\nmountains dip towards the southeast and the Triassic and the Jurassic rocks from \n\nescarpments are directed to the northwest. Swabian Alb Geopark is sparsely populated \n\nand is still a rural area. The Alb is a karst topography area and for this reason has the \n\nhighest density of caves in Germany, with many of caves open to the public. Important \n\nwells are also attractive karst features. Volcanic activities during the Tertiary left traces as \n\nMaars or cones of eroded vents and a thermal limestone travertine including plant and \n\nanimal fossils exit in this area (Heizmann, 2009).  \n\nDue to its rich geological heritage the Swabian Alb is a traditional geotouristic destination \n\nwith a high density of different attractions like 15 show caves, several museums, \n\ninterpretive trails and sites to fossick, etc. Guided landscape adventure tours by trained \n\nrangers are offered in different parts of the Alb. Moreover, the hot waters, rich in minerals, \n\nwhich well up from the depths of the earth provide a source of health which can be \n\nenjoyed in the pleasant resorts; spas and mineral baths of the region are another tourist \n\nattraction in this region.   \n\nThe geopark is organisationally incorporated into the Swabian Alb Tourist Board. It is a \n\ncooperation platform for different institutions such as ministries, universities, associations, \n\nand authorities, involved in geosciences, tourism, and nature conservation. The geopark is \n\nunder the supervision of the government; the local municipalities and tourism sector \n\nfinancially support the geopark. Their aim is to develop the geopark as a strong contributor \n\nto the sustainable development of the Swabian Alb. \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n129 \n\n4.1. 2.8.  Psiloritis Natural Park (Greece)  \n\nPsiioritis Natural Park is located on the Greek Island of Crete, in the southern Aegean \n\nSea. It has an area of 1200 Km2, with 157 settlements and towns and a population of \n\nabout 42234 inhabitants.  \n\nIt is the government and private administration who manage the geopark and 11 local \n\nmunicipalities financially support it. Moreover the geopark cooperates with other \n\norganizations such as Natural History Museum, university of Crete, AKOMM Psiloritis \n\n(Development Tourism Agency), local development S.A, Anogia Environmental Education \n\nCenter, Ministry of Education and   Psiloritis Land Network.   \n\nAside from management structure, Psiloritis geopark is known because of its big faults \n\nwith excellent and imposing fault surfaces, fossil sites (such as the Permian corals), \n\ncaves, impressive gorges, and plateaus that host many native species of the island, and \n\nunique fold associations. Geomorphologic structures have sustained the culture, tradition \n\nand customs of the inhabitants for thousands of years. In the Psiloritis mountains \n\nmythology, folklore, tradition, and natural environment meet together (Fassoulas et al., \n\n2009).   \n\nMoreover, many herbs and endemic plant and animal species flourish in this territory. \n\nThese include the aromatic (such as Origanum dictamnus) and rare plants and \n\nendangered animals (such as vultures: Gypaetus barbatus and wild cats: Felis silvestris \n\ncreticus) (Fassoulas et al., 2009).    \n\nConsequently, in this geopark, visitors have an extensive choice of activities ranging from \n\ngeo-sports, like swimming, hiking, mountain biking, and rock climbing to getting \n\nacquainted with the breathtaking science of geology, to observe birds, animals and plants, \n\nand to savour the traditional Cretan cuisine. Geo-products such as decorative or utilitarian \n\nornaments, commemorative goods from stone or wood, furniture, children's toys and \n\nclothes which are symbols of geopark other initiatives in this geopark (Skoula and \n\nFassoulas, 2006). \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.9.  Sobrarbe Geopark (Spain)  \n\nSobrarbe Geopark with a surface area of 2200 km2 (Poch, 2009) was registered in GGN in \n\n2006 and became a member of UNESCO Global Geopark Network. The geopark \n\nencompasses the entire Sobrarbe, and this area is located in the Alto Arag\u00f3n region, \n\nSpain, and is bordered by France along the north. The management structure of the \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n130 \n\ngeopark is public administration and the geopark is financially supported by the local \n\nmunicipality. Moreover, the geopark cooperates with other organizations such as  \n\nAssociation of Tourism Enterprises of Sobrarbe, Ordesa and Monte Perdido National \n\nPark, Natural Park Posets Maladeta, Natural Park Sierra y Ca\u00f1ones de Guara, Research \n\nCentre of Sobrarbe, Environmental Education organizations, the Tourism Department of \n\nthe Regional Government of Aragon, the Environment Department of the Regional \n\nGovernment of Aragon, the Education Department of the Regional Government of Aragon, \n\nthe University of Zaragoza, and University Aut\u00f3noma de Barcelona.  \n\nFurthermore, old mining activities of metal ores are located in the high Palaeozoic \n\nMountains in the northern part of the region, where glacial activities took place during the \n\nQuaternary (moraine deposits or glacial lakes). Further south, younger rock units from the \n\nMesozoic to Paleocene age forms the mountains of the Ordesa and Monte Perdido \n\nNational Park. As a result of the subterranean circulation of water, the region has one of \n\nthe most visited karstic systems of Europe. The southern area comprises Tertiary \n\nsedimentary rocks from the Eocene to Oligocene age. A large variety of fossils, from \n\nNummulite beaches to salt water crocodiles can be found in these rocks. In order to \n\nguarantee the conservation of this heritage, 50% of the surface area of Sobrarbe has \n\nbeen declared a protected area.  \n\nIn addition, the geopark authorities, in order to promote geotourism and education, rebuilt \n\nan ancient castle and  provided three new facilities, such as  the Sobrarbe Geopark visitor \n\ncentre \u201cSpace of the Sobrarbe Geopark\u201d, the \u201cTechnical Office\u201d and the \u201cGeo-vision \n\nRoom\u201d. Furthermore, five bicycle routes, brochures, interpretative panels and guide-\n\nnotebooks are other tourist facilities in this geopark (Poch, 2009).   \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.10.  Parque Cultural del Maestrazgo (Spain)  \n\nThe Maestrazgo Cultural Park with an area of 2700 km2 is situated in the heart of the \n\nIberian Mountains and was registered in UNESCO Global Geopark Network in 2004. The \n\nstructure of the geopark is not private and 43 local municipalities and the Cultural \n\ndepartment of regional government financially support the geopark. Moreover, the \n\ngeopark cooperates with other organizations and companies such as the local council of \n\nComarca Cuencas Mineras, Zaragoza University, Dinopolis, and Europe direct CAIRE.  \n\nAs for geology, this is an area where Mesozoic materials are predominant, being the \n\nbiggest part of the geological structure (Simon and Abril, 2009). The Maestrazgo geopark \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n131 \n\nis a lovely natural area, as well as an exceptional laboratory for exploring the Mesozoic \n\nand Tertiary evolution of the Iberian Plate.  \n\nTertiary materials are in several depressed areas, such as Val de Jarque, valleys of Mas \n\nde las Matas and Alcorisa, areas of Crivill\u00e9n, and Upper Guadalopillo; at the same time, \n\ntertiary materials are present in Sierra de Borden. \n\nRegarding lithology, strongly carbonated materials such as limestone dolomite rocks and \n\nmarl appear in the higher and middle areas in Maestrazgo.  \n\nThe strong folding undergone by Mesozoic levels in central Maestrazgo, as well as \n\nerosion by a river network, have produced steep areas, where canyons, crests, and \n\nhillocks are the main image: this produces large geomorphological diversity and \n\noutstanding landscape beauty.  \n\nBesides, calcareous rocks are favourable for endo-karstic processes; that is why caves \n\nand chasms are common in Maestrazgo.  \n\nThe Mining Interpretation Centre is located in Aliaga. It has created a whole lifestyle that \n\ncontinues alive in people, landscape, and facilities. Additionally, fossil richness (such as \n\ndinosaur fossils and footprints) in Maestrazgo Cultural Park is seen in the paleontological \n\npark in the village of Galve (Appendix 13).  \n\nIrrespective of geological heritage, there are 13 historical villages labelled as \"National \n\nMonument\", castles coming from the Middle Age, and old country houses known as  \n\n\"masadas\u201d in this territory.  \n\nThe Park can be admired and understood by means of signposts, pathways, guides, \n\nmuseums, a complete scientific guidebook for academic people, a short guidebook for \n\ntourists, pedagogic tools for primary and secondary schools (including field notebooks and \n\nan interactive CD published in 2004 and widely circulated among teachers), and a comic \n\nfor children. \n\n \n\n 4.1. 2.11.   Copper Coast Geopark (Ireland) \n\nThe Copper Coast Global Geopark is located on the South East coast of Ireland, between \n\nTramore and Dungarvan in County Waterford. The Copper Coast Geopark with 50 km2 \n\nwas registered in EGN in 2001. It is managed officially and the local municipality \n\nfinancially supports it. The geopark cooperates with other organizations and companies \n\nsuch as Geotourism Survey Instrument (GSI), F\u00e1ilte Ireland and Dunhill Ecoparks, \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n132 \n\nWaterford County Council (WCC), University College Cork (UCC), and Copper Coast \n\nTourism (CCT).  \n\nWith regard to geology, the Copper Coast is an outdoor geology museum with geological \n\nheritage sites that reflect a variety of environments within which the area has evolved over \n\nthe last 460 million years. Sedimentary and volcanic rocks illustrate the subsequent \n\nvolcanism. Copper was mined extensively in the area during the 19th century. The \n\ngeopark name is derived from this activity (Morris, 2009).   \n\nBeside the geological heritage sites, the geopark provided a range of educational \n\nservices. Provision of signs (road &amp; interpretation), a team of local guides trained by the \n\ngeopark, walking cards and paths, a geological garden, picnic tables, art and craft \n\nworkshops, the encouragement of growth of local businesses, an educational program \n\n(geology course), and fieldtrips for schools are instructional tools which were offered by \n\nthe geopark to tourists and students (McCarthy and Sweeney, 2008).  \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.12.   Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark (North Ireland)  \n\nThe Marble Arch Caves Geopark is located in County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland; this \n\ngeopark with 180 km2 was registered in the European Geopark Network in 2001 and \n\nbecame the first European geopark in the United Kingdom. It is the government which \n\nmanages the geopark and 2 County Councils, Fermanagh District Council and Cavan \n\nCounty financially support it. The geopark cooperates with other organizations and \n\ncompanies such as the Forest Service (Northern Ireland), the Northern Ireland \n\nEnvironment Agency, Colitte (Irish Forest Service), Fermanagh Lakeland Tourism, and \n\nCavan Tourism.   \n\nConcerning geography, Marble Arch Caves are one of the most significant caves in Britain \n\nand Ireland (Appendix 14). These caves were first explored in 1895 and were developed \n\nas a tourist cave in 1985 and they are now world famous as one of Ireland\u2019s leading tourist \n\nattractions.   \n\nThe geopark offers a wide range of environmental education and field studies to schools, \n\nuniversities, and adult groups. Besides, trained tour guides of the caves, a cave tour book, \n\nhill walking, and motor-touring routes are the services which are offered to geopark \n\ntourists (Watson and McKeever, 2009). \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n133 \n\n4.1. 2.13.   Lochaber Geopark (Scotland)  \n\nLochaber Geopark, located in the highlands of Scotland, was registered in UNESCO \n\nGlobal Geopark Network in 2007. The geopark is under the supervision of private sector \n\nand the geopark cooperates with other organizations and companies such as Scottish \n\nNatural Heritage, The Highland Council, Heritage Lottery Fund, Highlands and Island \n\nEnterprise, LEADER, and outdoor companies.  \n\nLochaber is famous for its spectacular scenery, which includes Britain\u2019s highest mountain \n\nand the prominent landmark called An Sgurr on Eigg which is built of a rock called \n\npitchstone: at 55 million years old it is the youngest volcanic rock preserved in Scotland.  \n\nLochaber geopark is unique among its European counterparts because it has a geological \n\nrecord that includes not only the creation of a huge mountain chain by the collision of giant \n\nplates, but also the dramatic volcanic activity associated with the much later tectonic plate \n\nrifting when Greenland and Europe drifted apart (House et al., 2009).  \n\nLochaber is also a popular visitor destination. It has good travel links as well as a range of \n\naccommodation to suit every budget. There is also the opportunity to take part in \n\nnumerous outdoor activities. This makes it an ideal location to discover more about the \n\nlocal landscape and enjoy a relaxing break. \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.14.  Geopark Shetland (Scotland - UK)  \n\nShetland is a group of Islands lying 140 km north of the Scottish mainland. The Geopark \n\nShetland includes a unique landscape and its rocks are hard and acidic (Swale, 2009).  \n\nThe geopark is coordinated by the Geopark Shetland Working Group (GSWG). The lead \n\npartner is the Shetland Amenity Trust, which employs a full-time Geology Project Officer to \n\ncoordinate the various geological activities and liaise with the European Geoparks \n\nNetwork.  \n\nThe GSWG includes representatives from several partners including the Shetland Islands \n\nCouncil, Scottish Natural Heritage, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Visit Shetland, the \n\nShetland Tourism Association, the Association of Shetland Community Councils and \n\nvarious community groups. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the Shetland Geopark is member in thematic networks such as the \n\nvolcanic thematic network and coastal thematic network.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n134 \n\nSwale (2009) noted that visitors are attracted by the wildlife, particularly the birds, \n\narchaeology and historical connections and the unique landscape. A recent establishment \n\nin the geopark has provided a journey through billions of years of fascinating geological \n\nheritage sites. The geology of Shetland is recognised as a fundamental factor for \n\nunderstanding of the islands\u2019 natural and cultural heritage.  \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.15.  Geological, Mining Park of Sardinia (Italy) \n\nThe Mining geopark covers an area of 3500 km2 and for the rich deposits of lead, zinc, \n\ncopper, tin, silver, and iron it has been acknowledged as one of the most important metal \n\ndistricts of Western Europe. Today all that remains of those areas is a rich heritage of \n\nmining archaeology as part of the Sardinian culture and past life (Manca and Pireddu, \n\n2003). In 2007, the Sardinia geopark became a member of the European and Global \n\nGeoparks Network. The geopark is financially supported by the Administration and \n\nEnvironment department. Sardinia cooperates with other organizations such as \n\nuniversities.   \n\nIn addition, the present economy of the geopark reflects the economy of Sardinia which is \n\ncharacterized by a weak structure; the sectors of tourism represent a strategy for \n\nrehabilitating this economy through geotourism. Tourists can visit a historic and \n\nenvironmental geo-mineral museum, where they can trace 8000 years of mining history \n\n(Agus and Atzei, 2009). And a lot enterprise is being done to offer its visitors a new and \n\ninteresting aspect of this wonderful island.  \n\nPorto Flavia, Henry gallery and other numerous tunnels that today have been transformed \n\ninto a museum are unique and particular examples of mining engineering in the past; and \n\nthey have revived the Italian Centre of Coal Culture and Saint Barbara\u2019s Cave.  \n\nThe Coal Museum is located in the Great Coal Mine of Serbariu in Carbonia, in the South \n\nWest of Sardinia. The mining site operated from 1937 to 1964 as the most important \n\nItalian energy resource.  \n\nIn early 2000 it was restored with educational and touristic purposes, leading to the \n\ninauguration of the Coal Museum in November 2006. The Museum tells the story of the \n\nmining site and of the miners who worked hard there (in the lamp room, the winding \n\nengine room, the mine shaft, and the underground gallery) (EGN, 2009c).  \n\nFurthermore, the geopark is characterized by an extended stretch of coast and variety of \n\ninteresting landscapes and environment.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n135 \n\n 4.1. 2.16.  Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy)  \n\nThe Adamello Brenta Natural Park with 1146.5 km2 is located in the west side of the \n\nTrento Province in north-eastern Italy. In 2008 it was recognized as an international \n\n\u201cgeopark\u201d inside the European Geoparks Network and the UNESCO Global Geopark \n\nNetwork. The geopark is managed officially and Autonomous Province of Trient financially \n\nsupports it. The geopark includes 39 municipalities and has a close cooperation with the \n\nlocal tourism sectors, schools, and a group of locals who involved in tourism \n\naccommodation activities.    \n\nIn the west, the protected area encompasses Adamello- Presanella Massif, with its 55 \n\nlakes and several glaciers; among them; the Mandron glacier is the widest glacier in the \n\nAlps. The eastern area of the park contains the Brenta Group, the western most extension \n\nof the Dolomites (Ferrari, 2009).  \n\nBeside geological heritage, Adamello Brenta Geopark has diverse ecological heritage, for \n\ninstance the bear and endemic flora. As the bears are endangered species, the geopark \n\nauthorities believe that future of the bears is in fact strongly linked to the development of \n\ncoexistence culture between people and the bears. \n\nAmong geoparks, Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy) is the first geopark in Europe \n\nwhich obtained ISO 14001 certification; the park can also boast EMAS registration \n\n(Moranduzzo, 2008). \n\nConcerning geopark activities, geopark officials try to promote the local economy through \n\nthe geopark brand. The Adamello Brenta European Geopark launched a project titled as \n\n\u201cQualit\u00e0 Parco\u201d. This project uses the logo as a local environmental/marketing certification \n\nfor hotels and local products. Moreover, the brand is used for agro-alimentary products as \n\nwell (Ilaria, 2011). By the end of 2009, the geopark brand was used for the \"Qualit\u00e0 Parco\" \n\nhotels and 35 hotels have been certified out of a total of 335 hotels which are located in \n\nprotected area. Moreover, the local tourism boards and other companies are allowed to \n\nuse the geopark brand for their brochures and leaflets when they carry out projects in \n\ncooperation or partnership with the park.  \n\nFurthermore, the geopark becomes an ideal place for educational activities; it is also a \n\nwell-suited place to spend a relaxing and healthy holiday and to practise outdoor sport \n\nactivities.   \n\nThe geopark also offers sports based on earth topography such as skiing, rock climbing, \n\nand geo-biking (Appendix 15).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n136 \n\nAn online shop on the geopark website is another tourist facility; the online shop offers \n\ngeopark T-shirts, geopark posters, hats, umbrellas, rucksacks, soft toys, canvas bags, \n\ngadgets, geopark DVDs and geopark publications to tourists.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Museum della Malga, ancient shepherd\u2019s huts, and other \n\nbuildings that maintain the characteristics of the traditional architecture are testimony to \n\nthe Alpine culture in this geopark.   \n\n \n\n  4.1. 2.17.  Nature Park Eisenwurzen (Austria)  \n\nThe Nature Park Eisenwurzen is located in the Austrian province of Styria. It is under the \n\nsupervision of government and private sector and 7 municipalities and environment \n\ndepartment financially support it. Moreover, Eisenwurzen geopark cooperates with other \n\norganizations and companies such as 12 Nature Park Partners, 13 Nature Park Speciality \n\nPartners, 7 Nature Parks of Styria, 17 GeoLine Partners, the Museum of Natural History, \n\nVienna, Landes museum Joanneum, Graz, Wasserleitungsmuseum Wildalpen; Geology \n\nexhibition of the National Park Ges\u00e4use, Collections of the monastery Stift Admont, \n\nGeological Survey of Austria, Universities of Vienna and Graz, Mining University of \n\nLeoben, Academy of Tourism, Krems; Tourism Agency Alpine Region National Park \n\nGes\u00e4use, Tourism Agency of Styria, the local tourism offices of the communities, and is in \n\npartnership with the tourism agencies of each of the 7 Styrian Nature Parks.  \n\nGeologically, Eisenwurzen is a part of the Northern Calcareous Alps. Its rocks, consisting \n\nprimarily of limestone and dolomite, were deposited over a time interval of 250 million \n\nyears, from the Late Permian to the present (Kollmann and Mitterb\u00e4ck, 2009). They were \n\nfaulted, folded, and uplifted during Alpine Orogeny. Glaciers of the Great Ice Age and \n\nrivers provided the unique landscape out of the rocks. Important geosites include the type \n\nsection of the Anisian stage of the Triassic and the Cretaceous / Palaeogene rocks of the \n\nGams area.  \n\nFurthermore, geotouristic activities are the domain of GeoLine, the geological branch of \n\nthe Nature Park. These comprise two permanent exhibitions: the museum of the Second \n\nVienna Water Supply Line, which benefits from karstic springs in the area, and the Geo-\n\ncentre of Gams, which provides an overview of the regional geology. Geo-trails and geo-\n\nbiking provide in-situ evidence of geological phenomena: rocks, fossils as well as \n\nformations reflecting the incredible forces at work during the building of the Alps. \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n137 \n\nThe most powerful of all geological agents may be explored in the Water Park of  \n\nSt. Gallen and with geo-rafting, which combines science with adventure (Appendix 16). \n\nGeo-rafting for kids combines sports and the fun of water with explanation of the \n\ngeological features along the river by especially trained raft-guides (Appendix 17). \n\nA landscape water model in the Water Park of St. Gallen is a place (11 \u00d7 9 m) which \n\nrepresents the geological approach to water activities. A thunderstorm is triggered by \n\npushing a button. The rising of a water table in the mountains can be observed through \n\npeep-holes and a spring begins to release water from the hill-sides. Streams merge into \n\nrivers which finally open out into the sea (Kollmann et al., 2009). Tourists and kids feel like \n\nGulliver in Lilliput when they visit this landscape model of water erosion in Gallen Park \n\n(Kollmann and Weiskopf, 2009). This model is an educational instrument where kids \n\nexperience water erosion.  \n\nBesides, the festival of geology which presents the volcanic eruption in the geopark is \n\nanother educational activity.  \n\nIn addition, a geo-workshop serves all activities related to the preparation of geological \n\nitems. Fossils found during guided field trips are prepared under supervision and then \n\ninvestigated under the microscope. Even ordinary pebbles from the close-by stream \n\nprovide unique souvenirs when they are cut and polished.  \n\nThe last but not the least innovative activity is an annual exhibition in the geopark, which \n\npresents an exhibition of silicified wood from the Petrified Forest of Lesvos and the \n\nBohemian Paradise, both members of the European Geoparks Network. Silica dyed by \n\niron, copper, or manganese has replaced the wood in silicified tree-trunks. Even after \n\nmillions of years, the characteristic wood structures of conifers, deciduous trees, or ferns \n\ncan be recognized. This is demonstrated by slices of modern wood provided by the \n\nAustrian Forestry Museum of Gro\u00dfreifling.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that the Eisenwurzen geopark strives to involve the local communities and \n\nvolunteers in conservation activities of geopark and create seasonal jobs for them. \n\nAccordingly, this geopark improves the local economy as well as education in this territory.  \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.18.  Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania) \n\nThe Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark with 1000 km2 in area is located in the central part \n\nof Romania, in a very fertile region, surrounded by mountains in all directions. This \n\ngeopark registered in GGN in 2005 and became a member of the UNESCO Global \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n138 \n\nGeopark Network. The management structure of geopark is official and the University of \n\nBucharest financially supports it. Moreover, the Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark \n\ncooperates with other organizations and companies such as the local administration, \n\nuniversities, country administration, and ministry of the environment.  \n\nAs for geology, the region is known world-wide for its \"dwarf dinosaurs\" from the end of \n\nthe Cretaceous, 65 million years ago and this special paleontological heritage has inspired \n\nthe name of the geopark. \n\nAnother geologic event that is well documented in the geopark is the volcanic rock-tuffs, \n\nlavas, and volcanic bombs marking the volcanic eruptions that took place in the region \n\nduring the dinosaurs\u2019 existence. \n\nFurthermore, the muddy volcanoes are a very rare phenomenon in continental Europe; \n\nthese sites are one of the most visited and photographed landmarks in the Romanian \n\ngeopark.  \n\nBesides, glacial lakes on the top of the mountains, at more than 2000m high, deep \n\ngorges, caves, alpine forests, meadows, orchards, and crops are the regional hosts of \n\nhuman history from the Paleolithic to Roman Antiquity and from the Middle-Ages to the \n\nModern time. \n\nIt is notable that the Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark plays an active role in the \n\neconomic development of its territory. Activities are financed through the projects and \n\ncontribution of the local mayoralties. \n\nRegarding this the geopark project aims to offer a general framework for development in \n\nthis region in an attempt to revive the local traditions and to identity a coherent direction \n\nfor economic development. According to this, there are two main axes to be followed: \n\n- To promote activities and projects in order to help local initiatives, to assure the increase \n\nof local incomes, and to create structures able to attract investments.  \n\n- To revive and strengthen the local and cultural identity which is very strong and in \n\ndanger of being lost through migration, poverty, external influences, and imports. \n\nIn addition, making geo-products in geopark such as dinosaur bread promotes education \n\nas well as the local economy.  \n\nThe revitalization of the folkloric and handicraft traditions in this region that was mostly \n\ninhabited in the past by farmers and shepherds represents another task of the geopark. \n\nThe \u201cHateg Country\u201d is renowned for the specificity of the peasants\u2019 costumes, in only two \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n139 \n\ncolors - black and white, for the villagers\u2019 music and dances as well as handicrafts, \n\nespecially woollen tissues and wooden sculptures. \n\nThe well preserved ruins, amphitheatre, and temples of the capital of the Roman province \n\nof Dacia, medieval fortresses, castles, churches, and monasteries, Dinosaurs valley trail, \n\nand butterfly discovery trails are geotourism sites of the geopark which were announced \n\nby UNESCO.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and bird watching are \n\noffered to visitors by the geopark (Andr??anu and Grigorescu, 2008).  \n\nThe last but not the least geopark activities are geo-educational programs for secondary \n\nschools and universities of Romania (Andr??anu, 2009). \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.19.  Bohemian Paradise (Czech Republic)    \n\nThe Bohemian Paradise with 700 km2 in area is situated nearly one hundred kilometres to \n\nthe northeast of Prague. The geopark, registered in GGN in 2005, became a member of \n\nthe UNESCO Global Geopark Network. It is under the supervision of government and \n\nprivate administrations; the geopark is financially supported by the local municipality. \n\nMoreover, the Bohemian Paradise geopark cooperates with other organizations such as \n\nenvironment department and tourism sectors.  \n\nApart from the management structure in the geopark, there are spectacular landscapes \n\nbuilt on a foundation of diverse rock types. Volcanic landscapes (including cinder cones \n\nand columnar jointed lavas) and Rock Cities (such as caves and rock shelters) are \n\ngeotourist attractions in this territory (?\u00eddko\u0161il et al., 2009).  \n\nGeopark authorities offer tourist facilities including ponds, outdoor swimming-pools, tennis \n\ncourts, golf, fitness centres, and skittles, saunas, solaria, squash and volleyball courts. \n\nFurthermore, the Bohemian Paradise region also offers suitable conditions for winter \n\nsports such as downhill skiing courses with ski lifts, cross-country tracks, and winter \n\nstadiums. \n\nIn addition, rafting, diving, boating, fishing, hiking, cycling, climbing, and bird watching are \n\nother recreation activities in this territory.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n140 \n\n 4.1. 2.20.  Gea Norvegica Geopark (Norway) \n\nGea Norvegica Geopark became a member of the UNESCO Global Geopark Network \n\n(GGN) in 2006 and became Scandinavia\u2019s first global geopark. Gea Norvegica Geopark is \n\nlocated in the south-eastern part of Norway. The total land area of geopark is 3000 km2. \n\nThe geopark is managed officially and 8 local municipalities and 2 counties financially \n\nsupport the geopark. The geopark cooperates with other organisations and companies \n\nsuch as tourism offices, the local food producers, schools, accommodations, and \n\nmuseums.  \n\nAs regards geology, the geopark is located where the old Scandinavian geology meets the \n\nyounger geology of continental Europe. Furthermore, the geopark is an international \n\nreference area for Carbonatites (limestone volcanism) (Dalhgren, 2009).  \n\nThe oldest rocks of Gea Norvegica geopark formed more than 15000 million years ago. \n\nThey were metamorphosed and deformed within the deep crust during the \n\nSveconorwegian Orogeny about 1 billion years ago. In this territory there are a large \n\nvariety of rocks which are famous for their minerals.  \n\nBesides this, two spectacular geopark localities (M\u00f8len and Jomfruland) are situated \n\nalong the largest deposits which formed 10,000 years ago.  \n\nGeopark authorities try to achieve three targets of the geopark (education, geotourism, \n\nand conservation); in this regard, they have designed a site for students and teachers of \n\nsecondary schools (Appendix 18), also, Gea Norvegica Geopark has developed some \n\nfundamental educational packages to be used in primary and secondary schools. \n\nConsequently, in March 2007 with the geopark\u2019s collaboration, geology was defined in the \n\ncurriculum of secondary schools (Geo1 and Geo2) (Annual Report, 2007).   \n\nIt is noteworthy that the geopark strives to train guides; the geopark guides are important \n\nambassadors for natural geological heritage and the local environment of the area. They \n\nare qualified and experienced communicators with a good knowledge about the geopark \n\nlocalities. With the local geology as the starting point, they show the interrelationships \n\nbetween the geology and the surrounding nature, historical and social development.  \n\nThe geopark guides must complete a training program in order to get their certification as \n\n\"Certified Geopark Guides\u201d. Likewise, geopark officials offer tourist facilities such as \n\ninterpretive panels which are compatible with the landscape.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n141 \n\n4.1. 2.21.  Magma Geopark (Norway) \n\nMagma Geopark is situated in southwest Norway and extends over 2329 km2. Magma \n\nGeopark is under the supervision of five municipalities (Bjerkreim, Eigersund, Lund, \n\nSokndal and Flekkefjord) which are located in the counties Rogaland and Vest-Agder.  \n\nThe landscapes of Magma geopark are unique. The landscape was strongly influenced by \n\nthe Ice Age and many glacial features are well preserved. \n\nMining history can be studied at several locations, including Bl\u00e5fjell (titanium), Gursli \n\n(molybdenum) and \u00d8rsdalen (tungsten and molybdenum) (Richard Wilson et al., 2008).  \n\nGeology has played an important role in the cultural and industrial development of the \n\nregion. Local mining activity started during the Iron Age when bog-iron deposits were \n\nexploited. Modern mining started in the mid-18th century.  \n\nFishing, sightseeing, day cruises, spas, skiing, cycling, boating and hiking are sports and \n\nadventure activities which the geopark offers to visitors.  \n\nDesigning a geopark calendar on the geopark website is an innovative strategy for \n\nadvertising regional festivals of Magma Geopark. Establishment of museums and galleries \n\n(e.g. an art gallery for paintings, ceramics, glass art, wooden art and so on) are another \n\nactivity of the geopark (Magma Geopark website, 2010).     \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.22.  Papuk Geopark (Croatia)  \n\nThe Papuk Geopark is situated in the eastern part of Croatia, in the Slavonia region. The \n\nlowland area of Slavonia is mostly flat agricultural landscape and Papuk as a part of \n\nSlavonian Mountains is a fairly distinctive feature in such a landscape. Papuk Geopark \n\ncovers an area with altitudes ranging from 200 to 953 meters and comprises the area of \n\nthe whole Papuk Nature Park (336 km2) that was protected by Croatian government in \n\n1999 (Radoni\u00e7 and Pavi\u00e7, 2007). Papuk was registered in the UNESCO Global Geopark \n\nNetwork in 2007; the geopark is under the supervision of government and the ministry of \n\nculture and tourism department financially support it. The geopark also earns some money \n\nfrom organizing walking tours, selling tickets or souvenirs. The Papuk Geopark is a \n\nfamous geopark in making souvenirs related to geopark elements such as Bat badges, \n\nPapuk Nature Park T-shirts, Papuk Nature Park logo badges, and so on (Appendix 19). \n\nMoreover, the geopark cooperates with all national parks and nature parks of Croatia.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n142 \n\nForest vegetation covers more than 96% of Papuk Nature Park and bats are famous \n\nforest inhabitants; they also live underground in Papuk.  \n\nBeside the ecological diversity, there is geological and cultural heritage in this territory. \n\nPapuk is made of rocks whose ages presumably vary about 400 million years, from the \n\nPaleozoic through Cenozoic sediments reaching the youngest geological features as tuff \n\nbarriers on Papuk waterfalls, whose creation process is present even today (Radoni\u00e7 and \n\nPavi\u00e7, 2007). \n\nOne of the results of complex geological relations in Papuk is the hydro-geological \n\nphenomenon of warm springs in several stream valleys.  \n\nFurthermore, there are significant remains of cultural heritage in the Papuk Geopark \n\nassociated with the pre-historic period and the middle ages (Radoni\u00e7 and Pavi\u00e7, 2009).  \n\nGeopark officials provide some tourist facilities including an educational centre, \n\nmultimedia hall and visitor centre which are placed in Velika. In addition, numerous hiking \n\ntrails enable visitors to stroll around the geopark. For sport enthusiasts there are free-\n\nclimbing sites and paragliding lifts off-site. There are 104 kilometres of marked bicycle \n\ntrails in Papuk and three educational paths with educational panels introduce the natural \n\nand cultural heritage of area to visitors. The public institution is offering interpretative \n\nguides through the natural and cultural heritage of the Nature Park for organized groups of \n\nvisitors, and for schoolchildren, authorities have prepared several educational programs in \n\nnature. \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.23.  Kanawinka Geopark (Australia) \n\nThe Kanawinka Geopark with 26910 km2 area is located in Southern Australia (Limestone \n\nCoast), Western District of Victoria, and has become recognised as Australia's first \n\nNational Geopark and the first Australian UNESCO Global Geopark in 2008. The geopark \n\nis managed by the local government and private administrations; 7 local municipalities \n\nfinancially support it. The geopark has close collaboration with Park Victoria, tourism \n\nsectors, and the geological society.  \n\nOne of the most important aspects of the geopark is the link between the geology and the \n\npeople, their stories, culture, and history that builds a sustainable source of geotourism, \n\nbrings jobs to rural and indigenous people and in turn helps to protect sites of importance \n\nand promote geo-heritage.   \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n143 \n\nKanawinka is the aboriginal meaning for \"the land of tomorrow\", but this area of Australia \n\nis considered as an important part of understanding the history of the earth's development \n\n(GGN, 2008b). \n\nGeopark authorities also place emphasis on volunteers working in the area, not only to \n\nconserve the natural environment but also to provide services for tourists. \n\nBesides this, interpretive signs, trail maps, workshops (such as basket weaving and \n\nvolcanic), helicopter tours around the coast, and a visitor information centre are facilities \n\nwhich are offered to tourists.   \n\nFurthermore, the visitor information centre (The Lady Nelson) gives visitors both \n\nprofessional and recreational overview of the region, and this place helps in employment \n\nof local and other scientists, writers, photographers, and artists to produce dedicated \n\ngeopark literature.   \n\nIn addition, the visitors can enjoy seeing and hearing the erupting neon volcano in the \n\ngeology room of the visitor centre and they can have a walking tour in the glass bottom \n\ncave (Appendix 20). Within the lava areas, there are four main precincts all with varying \n\nlandscapes according to the period and type of eruption, including Australia\u2019s youngest \n\nvolcanoes, highly accessible volcanic cave systems, off-shore volcanic islands, remains of \n\ncoastal volcanoes, and extensive systems of craters, lakes, and wetlands (The Lady \n\nNelson Centre, 2009). \n\nVictoria\u2019s Western District is Australia\u2019s most extensive volcanic province, recognised as \n\nbeing one of the most significant and the third largest in the world, encompassing more \n\nthan 56 sites. The Blue Lake and the Crater Lakes area are important sites in the \n\nKanawinka Geopark.  \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.24.  Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) \n\nLangkawi Island, one of the well-known Malaysian tourism island destinations and the \n\nwhole of its 99 islands covering a total area of 478 km2, has been designated a Malaysian \n\nheritage and a global geopark by UNESCO in 2007. \n\nThe management structure of the geopark is officially and financially supported by the \n\nFederal Government. The Langkawi Geopark has a close collaboration with the Malaysian \n\nHotel Association, Malaysia Travel and Tour Association, Langkawi Tour Guide \n\nAssociation, Mineral and Geoscience Department, Forestry Department, Wildlife \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n144 \n\nDepartment, Langkawil District Council, Education Department, Environmental \n\nDepartment, local universities, and Tourism Malaysia.  \n\nIn 1987 Langkawi Island was declared a tax-free island as a strategy to draw more visitors \n\nnot only to appreciate the exotic beauty of the island but also to shop and spend money. It \n\nis the only geopark in the world with the same duty-free status as Qeshm Geopark in Iran.  \n\nAs regards geology, the island possesses a long geological history that dates back to the \n\nearly Cambrian period. Among  the  main  attractions  of  Langkawi  Geopark are  its  \n\noldest  rock  formation,  high geological  value,  pristine  beaches,  and  education-based  \n\ntourism (Abdul Aziz, 2009).  \n\nMoreover, within  the  Langkawi Geopark  there are  three  geo-forest  parks:  the  \n\nMachinchang  Cambarian  Geoforest  Park, Dayang Bunting Marble Geoforest Park, and \n\nKilim Karst Geoforest Park ( Appendix 21 ) . \n\nGeopark authorities provide some tourist facilities and services such as sailing, \n\nsnorkelling, mangrove tours, jet skiing, diving, kayaking, abseiling, climbing, jungle \n\ntrekking, gliding and biking. Besides, Langkawi Geopark cable car tour, as an innovative \n\nstrategy, gives visitors an excellent view of the island and surrounding islands.  \n\nElephant riding which is available in Langkawi Island is another innovative geopark \n\nactivity. Visitors can take short, 5-20-minutes rides on an elephant at the Oriental Village \n\nin Burau Bay. The last but not the least innovative strategies of geopark are spa therapies, \n\ntraditional Malay body massage and traditional herbal and plant treatment. \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.25.  Itoigawa Geopark (Japan)  \n\nIn 2007, \u2018Japan Geopark Network\u2019 was established by 13 regions. This network aims to \n\npromote high quality standards in park services, sharing of common strategies, and the \n\nexchange of knowledge. In 2009, Global Geopark Network approved 3 geoparks in Japan; \n\ngeoparks registered in the UNESCO network were the Itoigawa geopark, the Toya Usu \n\nVolcano geopark, and the Unzen Volcanic geopark (Sasazawa, 2009).  \n\nThe Itoigawa Geopark with 746.24 km2 area is located on the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic \n\nLine; a fault zone that runs through central Japan. The geopark has many geological \n\nheritage sites, with rocks, minerals, and fossils ranging from the Paleozoic to Cenozoic \n\nEra, related to the processes of plate boundary areas.   \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n145 \n\nIn addition, people living near the local geoparks make efforts to raise local awareness of \n\neconomic development and to encourage healthy living in the area. For example, they \n\norganize field excursions visiting the natural heritage sites. Furthermore, they invite \n\nschools from urban areas such as Tokyo to the local geopark and offer the experience of \n\nagriculture and fishing to students (Appendix 22). Itoigawa Geopark encourages their \n\nactivities partly through the service by the Fossa Maguna Museum and partly through \n\nfinancial and logistic supports. The geopark is under the supervision of the local \n\ngovernment and private sector, but the local municipality financially supports the geopark \n\n(Takenouchi et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.26.  Araripe Geopark (Brazil) \n\nAraripe Geopark is located in the South of the State of Cear\u00e1, in the region of the \n\nsedimentary complex of Araripe. Araripe is the name of a rare bird found in this area.  \n\nThe Geopark territory extends over approximately 3520.52 km2 and covers 6 \n\nmunicipalities (Juazeiro do Norte, Crato, Barbalha, Miss\u00e3o Velha, Nova Olinda, and \n\nSantana do Cariri).  \n\nAraripe Geopark is an initiative of the State of Cear\u00e1 represented by the Secretariat of \n\nScience and Technology and Higher Education, coordinated by the Regional University of \n\nCariri-URCA. In December 2005, the Cear\u00e1 State Government requested UNESCO\u2019s \n\nDivision of Earth Sciences to acknowledge and accept Araripe Geopark as an effective \n\nmember of the world network of geoparks under the auspices of UNESCO (Herzog et al., \n\n2008).  \n\nFinally, in 2006 the Araripe became a member of the Global Geopark Network and the \n\nfirst geopark in the American continent (Slater, 2009).  \n\nThe management structure of the geopark is official and the Cear\u00e1 State Government \n\nfinancially supports the geopark.  \n\nAraripe Geopark is made up of nine sites of interest defined by their geological and \n\npaleontological relevance, which were named geotopes and are distributed throughout \n\nCariri. They are the most representative sites of their geological strata and of their \n\nfossiliferous formations (Herzog et al., 2008).  \n\nThe geopark territory belongs to a geologic fault bounded interior basin with sediment \n\nfrom the Devonian, Jurassic and mainly Lower Cretaceous periods with fossiliferous \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n146 \n\nsediments which are set on a metamorphic and igneous crystalline basement. It is \n\nnoteworthy that the first flowering plants and pollinating insects developed during the \n\nLower Cretaceous time in the Araripe (Herzog et al., 2008).  \n\nThe geopark authorities strive to develop educational programs for universities and \n\nschoolchildren (Appendix 23).  \n\nMoreover, they encourage locals to participate in conservation activities; in this regard, a \n\ngroup of students and volunteers are working on a conservation project titled \u201cGeopark \n\nnas escolas\u201d.  \n\nFurthermore, during seasonal events, geopark officials involve locals in workshops and \n\nfairs to help create supplementary income for local communities. In addition, authorities try \n\nto introduce the geopark as a tool for developing adventure and nature tourism; therefore \n\nthey have provided some tourism facilities such as sign posts, interpretative panels, \n\nartificial swimming pools and waterfalls for leisure-time activities, and hikes on trails in this \n\narea.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that there are some nature tourism potentials such as crocodile \n\nwatching and scuba diving in Araripe Geopark (C\u00e9sar Boggiani, 2009). Organizing a folk \n\nmusic festival (festival de Repentistas de Araripe) is another innovative activity in this area \n\nwhich is a strategy for cultural sustainability. \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.27.  Leiqiong Geopark (China)  \n\nLeiqiong Geopark with an area of 405.88 km2 is located in the southern margin of the \n\nChinese Mainland, straddling the Qiongzhou Strait. This geopark was registered in the \n\nUNESCO Global Geopark Network in 2006 (Huguangyan, 2008). Leiqiong Geopark \n\nconsists of three parts: Haikou-Shishan Volcanic National Geopark, Hainan Province, \n\nZhanjiang- Huguangyan National Geopark, Guangdong Province, and Beihai-Weizhou \n\nIsland Volcano National Geopark, Guangxi.  \n\nLeiqiong Geopark is a geopark with the subject of Quaternary Volcanoes. There are more \n\nthan 100 volcanic cones, lava tunnels, maar and maar lakes. It can be said that Leiqiong \n\nGeopark is a natural exhibition garden of Quaternary volcanoes. \n\nThe geopark has concentrated on maar clusters, and become the place where Maar Lake \n\nwas first studied in China. Moreover, Leiqiong Geopark organizes the cooperative study of \n\nChinese and German scientists (Kuiyuan et al., 2008). \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n147 \n\nTurtle rock is another geological heritage in this geopark. This site is unique among the \n\nvolcanic geological heritage of Leiqiong Global Geopark and of much scientific research \n\nvalue. Geological scientists or researchers need to study the formation characteristics of \n\nthe turtle rock to trace back the local geological environment during volcanic eruption. \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.28.  Yandangshan Geopark (China) \n\nYandangshan Geopark is located in Zhejiang Province in China, which covers an area of \n\n294.6 km2. This geopark was registered in the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network in \n\n2005.   \n\nYandangshan Geopark is a geopark with the subject of the geomorphology of Mesozoic \n\nrhyolite. The rock landform of the park is graceful, and the park in terms of geology is a \n\nlarge-scale Cretaceous caldera with abundant various rhyolites (GGN, 2008c).  \n\nYandangshan Geopark established a sister relationship with Hong Kong National \n\nGeopark.  \n\nThe landscapes of the geopark inspired many poets, painters and writers of China. An art \n\ngeological painting show of Yandangshan Geopark organized by local painters is an \n\ninnovation for introducing the geopark in this territory.  \n\n \n\n4.1. 2.29.  Qeshm Geopark (Iran) \n\nQeshm Island is one of the Iranian communities in which traditional culture and lifestyle \n\nare interwoven, and this was a key component for UNESCO to establish the first Iranian \n\ngeopark in this area. The Qeshm Geopark with an area of 32,000 ha is located in the \n\nPersian Gulf, Iran.  \n\nAccording to the Statistical Centre of Iran (2006), the total population of the Qeshm \n\nGeopark area is about 17,355 people who live in 19 villages. Pursuant to sustainable \n\ntourist attraction, the creation of Qeshm Geopark was important for geotourism \n\ndevelopment and the improvement of local socio-economic activities. Therefore, \n\nDarehshoori and Dakhteh launched the initial research activities of geopark, created in \n\nQeshm Island. Accordingly, the primary geological report of Qeshm Geopark was written \n\nby Haghipour et al. in 2005 (Turner 2008). After that, the S. Turner UNESCO advisory \n\ngroup of geopark experts travelled to Qeshm Geopark and prepared a report for UNESCO \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n148 \n\n(Ziari, Rostam Gorani, &amp; Beirand, 2008). Finally, Qeshm Geopark was registered in the \n\nGGN in 2006 and became the first geopark in the Middle East.  \n\nThere are eight major sites in Qeshm geopark, including: Chah-Kuh valley, the valley of \n\nStars, A\u2019li Channel, Tandis ha valley, Shour valley, Namakdan caves and dome, Doulab \n\nand Koorkoora kuh. Furthermore, Kase salkh desert and the Roof of Qeshm are important \n\ngeological monuments in this territory (Amrikazemi &amp; Mehrpooya, 2005). Besides the \n\ngeological heritage, there is ecological and archaeological heritage in Qeshm Geopark. \n\nSince, the Qeshm Geopark selected as a case study at local level; chapter 5, part 1 will \n\ndiscuss the geographical area of the case study (Qeshm Geopark) in detail. In addition, by \n\napplying a comparison model and SWOT (Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and \n\nThreats) analysis, new ideas for geotourism promotion and better management of the \n\ngeopark will be suggested.  \n\n \n\n4.1. 3.  Summary and Conclusions \n\nAll geoparks have the same targets (conservation of natural heritage, popularization of \n\ngeological sciences through education and geotourism development, development of local \n\neconomy through promoting geotourism and development of cultural sustainability). \n\nNetwork activities, collaboration with national parks and other organisations, innovative \n\nstrategies, and the local involvements are key components in leading geoparks toward \n\ntheir targets.  \n\nDeveloping local marketing under the geopark brand is a strategy which Naturtejo \n\nGeopark, Vulkaneifel Geopark, Nature Park Eisenwurzen, Naturepark TERRA.vita \n\nEuropean Geopark and Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta have applied to improve rural \n\ndevelopment in their territories. \n\nIt is noteworthy that all geoparks try to organize educational programs for schoolchildren \n\nand kids because they are not only the future generation of their territories but the \n\ncommunication bridge between schools and homes.  \n\nCombining fun and recreational activities with geo-knowledge is another new strategy in \n\nall geoparks appearing in geo-sports such as climbing, geo-biking, geo-kayaking, and so \n\non.  \n\nDevelopment of thematic geotourism can not only be a way for better management of \n\ngeoparks and exchange of geo-knowledge but can also increase the knowledge of \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n149 \n\ngeotravellers, researchers, students, and locals who are interested in the specific branch \n\nof earth sciences. According to natural landscape and geological heritage, geoparks which \n\nwere introduced in this study are classified in 6 categories:  \n\n\u2022 Group A (volcano tourist attractions) is famous for its volcanic landscapes. The \n\ntourists who travel to these geoparks can enjoy volcanic landscapes such as \n\nvolcanic rocks, volcanic bombs, cinder cones, columnar lavas, and so on. \n\nVulkaneifel Geopark, Kanawinka Geopark, Bohemian Paradise, Geopark \n\nShetland, Papuk Geopark, Leiqiong Geopark, Yandangshan Geopark, and \n\nLochaber Geopark are categorized in this group.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Group B (tourist attractions in the tectonic area) is famous for its tectonic \n\nlandscapes such as faulting and folding. Itoigawa Geopark, Psiloritis Natural Park, \n\nand Gea Norvegica Geopark are classified in this group.  \n\n  \n\n\u2022 Group C (Fossil tourism) is famous for its fossil tracks such as Naturtejo Geopark, \n\nArouca Geopark, R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence, Hateg Country \n\nDinosaurs Geopark, Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita, Swabian Alb Geopark, \n\nParque Cultural del Maestrazgo , and Araripe Geopark   \n\n \n\n\u2022 Group D (tourism and mining) is famous for its mining activities such as Sobrarbe \n\nGeopark, Copper Coast Geopark, Geological, Mining Park of Sardinia, and \n\nGeopark Harz Braunschweiger Land Ostfalen,  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Group E (Cave or karst tourism) is famous for its Cave and karst tourism; as a \n\nbranch of geotourism, it has gained popularity in geoparks such as Marble Arch \n\nCaves Global Geopark, Nature Park Eisenwurzen (the first caves with electric \n\nlights), Qeshm Geopark and Langkawi Geopark.   \n\n \n\n\u2022 Group F (glacier tourism) is famous for the development and conservation of \n\nglacier tourist resources in geoparks such as Magma Geopark and Parco Naturale \n\nAdamello Brenta.   \n\n\n\nChapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted \n\n150 \n\nIt is worth mentioning that all geoparks include various kinds of geological heritage sites, \n\nbut the aforementioned category is based on the unique geological patrimony in each \n\ngeopark. \n\nRegarding the development of thematic geotourism, educational activities and \n\npopularization of geo-sciences, most geoparks belonging to group C (fossil tourism) try to \n\nmake geo-products \u2013 products based on geological heritage \u2013 such as local cookies \n\nshaped like fossils. Thus geo-products not only offer local flavours to tourists and \n\nschoolchildren but promote their geo-knowledge and the local economy as well.  \n\nIn addition, establishing theme museums and geo-rooms in geoparks classified in group A \n\n(volcano tourist attractions) and D (tourism and mining) are other innovations for the \n\ndevelopment of thematic geotourism; for instance, Vulkaneifel Geopark established maar, \n\nvolcano, and iron museums in its territory. Moreover, Mining Park of Sardinia with \n\ninaugurating a geomineral and coal museum offers geological sciences to visitors. The \n\nvisitors can see the erupting neon volcano in the geology room of the visitor centre of \n\nKanawinka Geopark.  \n\nBesides theme museums, the establishment of seven thematic networks in European \n\nGeoparks is another innovative strategy regarding the exchange of geo-knowledge and \n\ndevelopment of thematic geotourism.   \n\nFurthermore, cave tour books, cave tours, cave tour guides, cave virtual tours, and so on \n\nwhich are the geotourist facilities supported by geoparks are categorized in group E (cave \n\nor karst tourism).  \n\nConsequently, acquiring experience through the comparison of geoparks can present a \n\nsupportive method and a brainstorm tool to discover new strategies for geotourism \n\ndevelopment and better management of geoparks.  \n\nExperiences gained from geoparks around the world can be a guideline for proposed and \n\naspiring geoparks which want to become a member of UNESCO Global Geopark \n\nNetwork.     \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4- Sustainable Tourism in \nUNESCO Global Geoparks Network  \n\n \nPart 2- Findings of the Empirical Study at \n\nInternational Level \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n151 \n\n4.2.1.  Profile of UNESCO Global Geoparks  \n\n4.2.1.1.   Introduction \n\nSustainability as a general concept for tourism has three inter-connected aspects: \n\nenvironmental, sociocultural, and socioeconomic; furthermore, geotourism follows \n\nsustainability principles. This part focuses on three dimensions of sustainable tourism in \n\ngeoparks. The purpose of this chapter is to test the hypotheses stated in chapter three.   \n\nIn this chapter the main objective is to introduce geoparks and geotourism as a gateway to \n\nrural development and sociocultural sustainability.  \n\nRegarding this, samples from 25 geoparks were compared. Data were analyzed using the \n\nSPSS software, and results profiled by frequencies.  \n\nThe European Geopark Network and the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network have \n\nintroduced geotourism as one of the main targets for geoparks in parallel with \n\nconservation and education. For that purpose it is crucial to apply the network concept to \n\ngeotourism activities, therefore, section 4.2.1.5, is aimed at analysing the network activity \n\nbetween geoparks and evaluating the connectivity rate of the Global Geoparks Network \n\nand the European Geoparks Network \n\nThis chapter starts with sociocultural sustainability in geoparks, followed by examining the \n\nrole of establishment of geoparks in socioeconomical and socio-environmental impacts on \n\nrural areas, and concludes by introducing innovative strategies and innovation in geoparks \n\nfor the development of geotourism and rural development.   \n\n \n\n4.2.1.2.   Sociocultural Sustainability in Geoparks \n\nThe aim of this section is testing the following hypotheses: \n\n\u2022 H5: Geoparks contribute to promoting regional geotourism products and local \n\nproducts \n\n\u2022 H6: Geoparks promote geotourism through innovative strategies  \n\n\u2022 H8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of \n\ntourism perceived by the local communities  \n\nThis section raises the issue of whether the establishment of geoparks is a gateway for \n\ncultural sustainability and local identity preservation in rural areas or not. \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n152 \n\nAccording to some authors: Xun and Milly, 2002; Tingshan, 2004; Zouros, 2004; Collyer, \n\n2007; Mendoza and Navarro, 2007; Poch, 2007; Andr??anu and Giraud, 2009; Marques, \n\n2009; Fassoulas and Zouros, 2010; McKeever et al., 2010, and Weber, 2009, geoparks \n\ncan play a role for cultural sustainability in rural areas.  \n\nOrganizing regional fairs and festivals, establishing cultural trails and museums, rebuilding \n\nhistorical places, creating geo-products and promoting local products and handicrafts are \n\nexamples regarding cultural preservation in geopark territories.  \n\nSince creation of geoparks plays a role in promoting local cuisine, products, and \n\nhandicrafts as cultural components, the questions were designed around local marketing. \n\nThe questionnaires sent to all geoparks around the world address several topics related to \n\nregional food, products, agricultural products, souvenirs, and craft products which are \n\nillustrated in Table 4.2.1.   \n\nThe first question inquires into the awareness of the role of geoparks in promoting regional \n\nfood and craft products. The second question evaluates the methods which are applied by \n\ngeoparks to promote regional products.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.1- Descriptive analysis of cultural sustainability questions in geoparks around the \n\nworld (numbers of samples are 25 geoparks)  \n\nVariable \nYes No \n\nPercent \n\nGeopark promotes regional food and craft \n\nproducts  \n80.0 20.0 \n\nEfforts which are taken to create and promote \n\nregional geotourism products of the geopark \n  \n\n- Producing regional and/or ecological \n\nproducts in restaurants \n44.0 56 \n\n- Organizing local markets for regional and \n\nagricultural products  \n24.0 76.0 \n\n- Providing a label for regional food or local \n\ngastronomy  \n28.0 72.0 \n\n- Making casts and souvenirs  56.0 44.0 \n\n- Serving local food on tours   52.0 48.0 \n\n- Creating initiative activities  48.0 52.0 \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n153 \n\nBased on the result of this descriptive analysis, geopark activities help to promote regional \n\nfood and craft business. It is noteworthy that for the majority of respondents (80.0%), \n\ngeopark creation plays a role in promoting local cuisine, local products, and handicrafts as \n\ncultural components.  \n\nRegarding the promotion of regional geotourism products in geopark territory, each \n\ngeopark applies a method (Figure 4.2.1): some of them serve local food and products on \n\ntours (19%) or restaurants (16%) and some geoparks create local businesses under the \n\ngeopark brand or using a local label for products (10%). Furthermore, 9% of geoparks \n\norganize regional, agricultural product marketing, and 21% establish souvenir shops in \n\ngeopark villages. 18% of the respondents\u2019 activities are all innovation such as producing \n\ngeo-products \u2013 local products which are related to the geopark activities or are the symbol \n\nof the geopark \u2013 certifying agricultural products by use of the local logo, holding \n\nworkshops on local products, exhibiting local products, providing handicrafts and folk \n\nmusic during regional festivals and fairs, serving local products in conferences, promoting \n\nregional and international media, and publishing books and booklets.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.1- Percentage of respondents to \u201cWhich efforts are taken to create and promote \n\nregional geotourism products of the geopark?\u201d (Source: Farsani et al., 2012b) \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n154 \n\nThe following examples were supplied by respondents to the open question about the \n\ncultural sustainability strategies of geoparks in their territory.     \n\nThe Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) exposes Malay herbal treatments and ancient health \n\nrituals to tourists. Moreover, in order to prevent the demise of the local language in the \n\ngeopark territory, a geopark song has been sung in the local language which is available \n\non the Langkawi Geopark website.   \n\nThe Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) holds regional and national festivals featuring such  \n\naspects as traditional soup, local cheeses, olive oil, pottery, bread, and green beans to \n\nrevive the local products and traditional culture. Designing a geopark calendar is another \n\nstrategy for rural cultural sustainability in Naturtejo Geopark. The geopark calendar not \n\nonly conserves the local culture and events in geopark but also is a way to reduce mass \n\ntourism. For instance one of the festivals in Naturtejo Geopark is the chestnut festival \n\nwhich is held in November, and normally autumn is not a high tourist season.  \n\nThe Qeshm Geopark (Iran) holds a seafood festival several times a year to improve the \n\nlocal economy and introduce local food. In the Qeshm Island, the sea and fishing play a \n\nmajor role in people\u2019s livelihood. The other festival titled Nowruz Sayyad as a traditional \n\ncelebration is organised by the geopark at the beginning of the main fishing season in late \n\nJuly. At this time local fishermen stop fishing, because they believe that the fish should \n\nhave a chance to reproduce.  \n\nAs Halloween is an annual holiday observed on October 31 \u2013 primarily in Ireland, \n\nScotland, Canada and the United States \u2013 Copper Coast Geopark located in Ireland \n\nattempts to preserve this national festival in its territory through holding workshops such \n\nas Pumpkin Carving during Halloween. Waterford Harvest Festival is another festival that \n\nthis geopark tries to preserve. Meanwhile, Copper Coast Geopark (Ireland) attempts to \n\nrevive the Copper Coast women's initiative with items such as food, beverages, and crafts.  \n\nIn addition, officials of Romania\u2019s geopark (Hateg Country Dinosaurs) established a small \n\ncentre for promoting local products, handicrafts, and souvenirs. They arrange meetings \n\nwith local producers in order to exchange of knowledge for development of local business. \n\nFurthermore, Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark has published a book about local cuisine.  \n\nIn another European geopark, Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy), a project has been \n\nextended titled \u201cQualita Parco\u201d for agro-alimentary products and to certify agricultural \n\nproducts under the local park quality logo. A basket of park products that includes 14 \n\ntypical products from protected area has been created (Ilaria, 2011).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n155 \n\nWith the aim of reviving local handicrafts, Arouca Geopark (Portugal) organizes handicraft \n\ncompetitions with geopark themes (appendix 34).  \n\nThe findings also illustrate that geoparks attempt to boost cultural pride and to revive \n\ntraditional food, local arts, and traditional culture through exposing them to tourists; \n\nthereby geoparks, by promoting geotourism marketing and innovative strategies, can help \n\nto reduce the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in their territory.  \n\nTo give a more detailed description of the role of geoparks on cultural sustainability and \n\nminimization of negative sociocultural impacts of tourism, the cultural activities of 25 \n\ngeoparks are summarized in Table 4.2.2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n156 \n\nTable 4.2.2- Key strategies applied in geoparks for sociocultural sustainability (countries that replied to the questionnaires)  \n\n(Source: Farsani et al., 2012a, 2012b) \n\nNO Country Geopark name Key Strategies for cultural sustainability \n\n1 Greece Psiloritis Natural Park \n- Creating geo-products such as decorative or utilitarian ornaments, \n\ncommemorative goods from stone or wood, furniture, children's toys, and \nclothes which are symbols of the geopark \n\n- Holding open-air painting festivals \n2 Spain Parque Cultural del Maestrazgo - Establishing the history museum in Mas de las Matas  \n\n- Establishing the cultural park of Molinos \n3 Spain Sobrarbe Geopark - __ \n\n4 Portugal Naturtejo Geopark \n\n- Designing a geopark calendar for events \n- Creating geo-bakery and geo-restaurant \n- Holding regional and national festivals such as traditional soup, cheeses, \n\nolive oil, pottery,  bread, watermelon, and green beans \n- Organizing holy walking in the geopark during Easter \n- Holding workshops in making artisan candles, bread, and pottery (this \n\nactivities preserve traditional culture) \n- Holding lectures for hotel guests about the Easter traditions of Idanha-a-\n\nNova during Easter  \n- Holding a festival of local wines and handmade liquors  \n- Organizing a fair of local products, gastronomy and bread \n- Establishing Olive Oil Route  \n- Organizing a fair around the new earth products \n\n5 Portugal Arouca Geopark \n\n- Encouraging local schoolchildren to dress up like trilobites, raft boats, and  \nArouca geopark customs in carnivals \n\n- Preparing a geo-dessert book (a book with some ornamental desserts in \ngeological elements) \n\n- Organizing a geo-art competition for local artists \n\n6 Italy Geological, Mining Park of Sardinia \n- Holding cultural festivals such as peasant marriage rituals, traditional \n\ncostumes, and the rituals of holy week  \n- Serving regional food (with local music) during fairs and cultural \n\nevents \n\n7 Italy Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta - Certifying agricultural products under the local park quality logo   \n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n157 \n\nTable 4.2.2- Key strategies applied in geoparks for sociocultural sustainability (countries that replied to the questionnaires, (cont.))  \n\n(Source: Farsani et al., 2012a, 2012b) \n\nNO Country Geopark name Key Strategies for cultural sustainability\n\n8 Croatia Papuk Geopark \n- Making souvenirs based on natural and geological heritage of the \n\ngeopark  \n- Holding traditional tournaments such as Medieval Knight Tournament \n\n9 Romania Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark \n\n- Publishing books about local cuisine \n- Establishing a small centre for promoting local products, handicrafts, \n\nand souvenirs \n- Creating geo-products such as dinosaur bread, etc.  \n- Holding a meeting for geopark officials and local producers \n- Organizing a new course on \u2018Local Tradition\u2019 which was introduced to \n\nthe local curriculum for 11 \u2013 12-year-old children \n\n10 Austria Nature Park Eisenwurzen \n\n- Organizing medicinal herb tours  \n- Holding courses on aromatherapy  \n- Offering various herbal teas, herbal salts from wild herbs, flowers, salts, \n\nfloral, and herbal skin care products \n- Preparing stone pine schnapps \n- Organizing geotourism markets and producers of common marketing \n\nunder the geo Line brand  (geopark brand) \n\n11 France R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique  de Haute-Provence \n- Linking craft businesses to the Reserve network and making products based on \n\nthe geological elements (bakeries, pastries, ammonite chocolate, carvers, and \nceramic makers) \n\n12 Czech Republic Bohemian Paradise - Holding the traditional September festival \n\n13 Germany Swabian Albs  Geopark - __ \n\n14 Germany Vulkaneifel Geopark - Creating a geo-cocktail  such as Vulkaneifel Mineral Water cocktails  \n\n15 Germany Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita - __ \n\n16 Germany \nGeopark Harz .

Socioeconomic Impacts of the Establishment of Geoparks \n\nSince geoparks are pioneers in geotourism and are examples of sustainable local \n\ndevelopment, in this study we try to discover strategies that are applied in geoparks to \n\nimprove the local economy and local business. This section is specifically concerned with \n\nthe effect of the establishment of geoparks on development of the local economy through \n\ngeotourism and creating new job opportunities. Regarding this, this section aims at testing \n\nthe following hypotheses:  \n\n\u2022 H3: Geotourism activities in geoparks create opportunity for local development  \n\n\u2022 H4: Using geotourism can be a useful strategy for developing tourism in geoparks \n\n\u2022 H7: Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and \nemployment of local communities in rural areas and geopark territories \n\n\u2022 H9: Geoparks do not function similarly in terms of management  \n\nBy comparing twenty-five different geoparks as geotourism destinations in Europe, Asia, \n\nAustralia and South America we accessed various strategies of tourism development and \n\ndevelopment of the local economy in geoparks. Furthermore, in this section we follow the \n\nspecific objectives that are mentioned below: \n\n\u2022 To improve the local economy \n\n\u2022 To identify the role played by geoparks in improving the living conditions of the \n\nlocal population \n\n\u2022 To engage the local communities in geotourism and geopark activities \n\n\u2022 To evaluate the role played by tourism in achieving better quality of life and \n\neducation for local population and stimulating economic growth \n\n \n\n4.2.1.3.1.  Strategies Applied for Development of the Local Economy in Geopark \nTerritories \n\nSince geoparks are new model of sustainable development and protection of nature, \n\nsome questions were designed to investigate which geoparks are under the supervision of \n\nwhich organisations (Table 4.2.3). According to results of descriptive analyses in Table \n\n4.2.3, the majority of geoparks (52%) are managed officially, and in most countries \n\ngeoparks (52%) are financially supported by local municipalities. Thus, geoparks are \n\nestablished at an international level but managed at a local level.   \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n160 \n\nIn view of the fact that geopark activities are interdisciplinary, the observations illustrate \n\nthat all geoparks cooperate with other organizations such as tourism sectors, universities, \n\nschools, environmental organizations, national parks, geological and geographical \n\norganizations, NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations), private sectors, museums, etc.  \n\nIt can be said that the establishment of geoparks created some direct job opportunities. It \n\nis evident that the numbers of indirect job opportunities which appeared through \n\ndevelopment of geotourism and geopark activities is more than the direct jobs in geopark \n\nterritories.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.3 - Descriptive analysis of questions regarding management structure of geoparks \n\n \n\nQuestions Yes \n\nPercent \n\nWhat is the management structure of geoparks in your country? \n\n\u2022 Public administration \n\n\u2022 Private administration \n\n\u2022 Both \n\n- \n\n52.0 \n\n8.0 \n\n40.0 \n\nWhich organizations financially support geoparks in your country?  \n\n\u2022 Municipality \n\n\u2022 Tourism department \n\n\u2022 Environment department and Municipality \n\n\u2022 Other \n\n- \n\n52.0 \n\n4.0 \n\n20.0 \n\n24.0 \n\nPercentage of employees who work in the geopark?  \n\n\u2022 Full time \n\n\u2022 Part time \n\n\u2022 Both \n\n- \n12.0 \n\n16.0 \n\n72.0 \n\nDoes the geopark cooperate with other organizations and companies? \n100 \n\n \n\n \n\nPursuant to some authors such as:  Xun and Milly, 2002; Xun and Ting, 2003; Zouros, \n\n2004; Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009; Rodriguse and Carvalho, 2009; Eckhardt, 2009; \n\nDowling, 2009; Turner, 2008; McKeever et al., 2010, and Zouros, 2009; the establishment \n\nof geoparks in rural areas can play an important role in the development of the local \n\neconomy. Promoting geotourism and ecotourism to attract more tourists, creating new job \n\nopportunities such as establishment of geo-restaurants, geo-bakeries, family guest \n\nhouses and geotours, promoting local products and geo-marketing under the geopark \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n161 \n\nbrand, creating job opportunities in the form of second job, part time and seasonal job, \n\nand involving local communities in geopark activities are good examples for the \n\ndevelopment of the local economy in geoparks territory.  \n\nIn order to gain experiences from geopark authorities\u2019 knowledge, we designed some \n\nquestions (Table 4.2.4) that reflect the role of geopark establishment in the development \n\nof the local economy.  \n\nThe first question inquires into the awareness of geopark activities in the prosperity of the \n\nlocal economy. The second question evaluates whether geoparks provide second jobs or \n\nseasonal job opportunities for local communities. The third, fourth, and fifth questions ask \n\nwhether geoparks involve locals in conservation activities, workshops, and geopark team \n\nwork.  \n\nTable 4.2.4 - Statistical analysis of strategies regarding tourism, conservation, and education \n\nactivities applied to promote local economy in geoparks \n\nQuestions Mean SD N Missing Yes No \nNo \n\nanswer\nWhat efforts are undertaken to promote links \n\nbetween the geopark and the local economy? \n- - - - - - - \n\n\u2022 A label given to the regional services - - 25 0 36% 64% - \n\n\u2022 Direct marketing for regional \n\nproducts \n- - 25 0 36% 64% - \n\n\u2022 Tourism offers including tours of \n\ncollaboration with local businesses \n- - 25 0 80% 20% - \n\n\u2022 Links with other local activities \n\n(boating, bird watching, cultural \n\nactivities, etc.) \n\n- - 25 0 68% 32% - \n\nHow many employees of the geopark are \n\nlocals? \n18.32 27.68 25 0 - - - \n\nDoes the geopark create second or seasonal \n\njob opportunities for local communities?  \n- - 25 0 48% 52% - \n\nDoes the conservation of the geopark improve \n\nthe local economy? \n- - 24 1 83% 13% 4% \n\nAre the workshops managed by locals? - - 24 1 68% 28% 4% \n\n \n\nBased on the result of descriptive analysis (Table 4.2.4 and Figure 4.2.2) the majority \n\n(80%) of respondents believe that in geopark territories, involving local businessmen in \n\ntourism marketing such as tours, is the best way to promote the local economy; moreover, \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n162 \n\n68% of geoparks try to link their activities with other local tourism activities such as \n\nboating, bird watching and cultural activities, for example. Aside from tourism marketing, \n\ngeoparks, with a view to local economic development, strive to support local products and \n\nservices through a label (36%) or direct marketing of regional products (36%).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.2 - Percentage of replies to the different economic strategies in order to promote \n\nlinks between geoparks and the local economy (Farsani et al., 2011a) \n\n \n\nObservations (Figure 4.2.3) demonstrate that by the end of 2009, geoparks in each \n\nterritory employed an average of about 18 local persons in the geopark structure (mean = \n\n18.32, standard deviation [SD] = 27.68). Obviously, the average numbers of local people \n\nwho are involved in all geopark activities is more than 18 persons since geoparks, through \n\nconservation activities, educational programmes, festivals, fairs, workshops, tourism and \n\ngeotourism, engage large numbers of locals and volunteer workers in geopark actions in \n\nthe form of part- or full-time work, seasonal and second jobs. It is noteworthy that 48% of \n\ngeoparks, through providing second or seasonal job opportunities for local communities, \n\nattempt to generate supplementary income for them (Table 4.2.4). \n\nAccording to questionnaires filled in by authorities, during the summer time (from May to \n\nOctober), Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy) authorities employ 40 temporary staff \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n163 \n\nwho usually work in the \u2018Visitor Centre\u2019, \u2018Environmental Educational Office\u2019 and on dates \n\nwhen the park carries out the sustainable mobility projects. \n\nThe Marble Arch Cave Geopark (UK) authorities also employed 35 seasonal tour guides \n\naround the geopark. Moreover, the Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) strives to create summer \n\nbusiness in river beaches, jobs in coffee shops near the geo-monuments, summer \n\noccupation for students working in the Paleozoic Museum and jobs maintaining the \n\nIconological Park of Penha Garcia.  \n\nIn addition, around 12 people work in the Eisenwurzen Geopark (Austria) on contract for \n\nseasonal jobs. The R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence (France) provides seasonal \n\njobs in the geopark for tour agencies, and the Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) provides jobs \n\nranging from catering services to food for tour packages as well. \n\nFurthermore, officials of the Araripe Geopark (Brazil) try to involve local artists and \n\nproducers in workshops and also, during seasonal events such as \u2018romarias\u2019 at the \n\nCultural Geotope of Juazeiro do Norte, officials attempt to provide some new jobs for local \n\ncommunities such as fossil replica workers. \n\nResults (Table 4.2.4) indicate that the majority of geopark authorities (83%) believe that \n\nconservation activities improve the local economy in their territory. The last but not the \n\nleast geopark activity is holding workshops by local geologists, local artists, etc. \n\nWorkshops as an educational programme are known as a conservation method in \n\ngeology, and it is not only a way to preserve geoparks but also involves locals in \n\nworkshops and promotes the local economy. Results demonstrate that the majority of \n\ngeoparks (68%) emphasize holding workshops by local communities. \n\nThe next sections will discuss details about conservation and educational activities in \n\ngeoparks.   \n\nConsequently, geoparks play an innovative role for entrepreneurship, the creation of new \n\njobs, and reducing the unemployment rate, especially in rural areas.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n164 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.3- The numbers and the percentage of local employees (part-time, full-time or \n\nseasonal) in each geopark according to the responses to the questionnaires (Source: Farsani \n\net al., 2011a) \n\n \n\n4.2.1.3.2.  Geotourism Marketing in Geoparks \n\nAccording to the National Geography definition, \u201cgeotourism is a market of about 55.1 \n\nmillion travelers who seek authentic experiences, care about the protection and \n\npreservation of the places they visit, and are willing to spend more money to achieve \n\nthese goals. Average ages range from 43-55 years, average household incomes are high \n\nAraripe Geopark \n\nBohemian Paradise \n\nTERRA.vita \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n165 \n\nwith 38-46% earning more than $75,000 annually, average number of leisure trips taken \n\neach year is 4 or more, and education levels are also high\u201d.  \n\nMoreover, some authors such as Gledhill (2008) and Boley (2009) noted that geoparks \n\nare an ideal destination for sustainable tourism and educational activities in rural areas in \n\nthe world, especially in Europe. Pursuant to geopark activities and the literature review, it \n\nis evident that geoparks play an important role in the development of the local economy of \n\ntheir territories through increasing the number of visitors and promoting geotourism. \n\nRegarding this, some questions were designed to reflect the relation between tourism \n\nmarketing and geoparks.  \n\nThe first question is an initial attempt to investigate the relationship between geoparks and \n\nthe tourism sector. The second one evaluates the role of geoparks in the development of \n\nthe local economy in the tourism sector. The third question assesses demand indicators \n\nfor tourists in geoparks, and the fourth and last questions inquire whether the local \n\ncommunities are stakeholders in geopark activities in the form of geotourism or not.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.5- Descriptive analysis of tourism activities questions in geopark \n\nQuestions Yes No \nPercent \n\nDoes the geopark have close collaboration with the \ntourism sector 96.0  4.0 \n\nVisitors benefit the local businesses in geoparks by:   \n- Buying entrance tickets 44.0 56.0 \n\n- Participating in geopark tours 80.0 20.0 \n\n- Buying souvenirs 80.0 20.0 \n\n- Participating in workshops and conferences 48.0 52.0 \n\n- Other  20.0 80.0 \n\nDo you count the visitors?  40.0 60.0 \n\nThe geopark engages the locals as guides and park \nguards  88.0 12.0 \n\nLocal people are stakeholders in the tourism sector 84.0 16.0 \n\n  \n\nBased on the results of descriptive analysis (Table 4.2.5), the majority of geoparks (96%) \n\nhave a close collaboration with tourism sectors.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n166 \n\nThe European Geoparks Network and The Global Geoparks Network hope that this \n\ncooperation promotes geoparks as a premiere tourist destination, and at the same time \n\npaves the way to build a better and greater understanding in protecting the natural \n\nenvironment. \n\nIt is evident that in geoparks, visitors benefit local economy (through rural \n\naccommodations, shops, souvenirs, restaurants, handicrafts, recreation activities, \n\neducational programmes, etc.).  \n\nBy the end of 2009, samples indicate that just 40% of geoparks count visitors, and among \n\ngeoparks only 13 geoparks replied to the question (Do you count the visitors?). The \n\nresults of the descriptive analysis of secondary data (Table 4.2.6) illustrate that annually \n\nan average of 7.8 million geotourists visits geoparks around the world; this number of \n\ngeotourists in the European geoparks is about an average of 4.3 million per year. \n\nMoreover, the average of the maximum duration of stay of geotourists is estimated at 4.7 \n\ndays in geoparks; the number of overnight stays is one measure for the economic \n\nimportance of tourism for a region.  \n\nAmong geoparks, Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) with 2,000,000 visitors per year is above \n\nall in the samples.  \n\nTherefore, geoparks are known as the geotourist destination in the recent decade. \n\nRegarding tourism asset attraction, each geopark applies a method to promote the local \n\nbusinesses by visitors (Table 4.2.5). Some geoparks generate income by selling entrance \n\ntickets (44%); some of them try to involve visitors in geopark tours (80%), and some \n\nencourage tourists to buy souvenirs (80%). Furthermore, 48% of geoparks strive to \n\nengage visitors in workshops and conferences; these educational activities represent the \n\nkey elements for a successful implementation of the geopark conservation and geoparks\u2019 \n\nstrategy at the local community level.  \n\n20% of respondents selected the option \u201cother\u201d and they mentioned museums, \n\neducational field trips, local restaurants, local accommodation, shops, pubs, food, coffee \n\nshops, bars, and outdoor activities as tourism activities which can improve the local \n\neconomy in geoparks.   \n\nBesides this, 88% of geoparks engage locals as guides, park guards, or other posts \n\nrelated to the tourism sector. Respondents believe that geoparks employ an average of 27 \n\n(SD= 45.387) persons as guides or park guards. It is noteworthy that, by the end of 2009, \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n167 \n\n84% of geopark authorities declared that locals are stakeholders in the tourism sector of \n\ngeoparks. \n\nTable 4.2.6- Annual visitor arrivals in geoparks (at the end of 2009) \n\n \n\nGeopark Visitors  \n(per year) \n\nForeign  \nvisitors  \n\n(per year) \n\nDomestic \nvisitors  \n\n(per year \n\nMaximum \nduration of \n\nstay \n\nAraripe Geopark                           19920 504 19416 3 \n\nArouca Geopark                                   20000 2000 18000 2 \n\nBohemian Paradise                    - - - - \n\nCopper Coast Geopark                            - - - 14 \n\nGea Norvegica Geopark - - - - \n\nGeo and Nature park TERRA.vita - - - - \n\nGeological, Mining Park of Sardinia       - - - - \n\nGeopark Harz.

Geotourism Marketing under the Geopark Brand and Eco-labels \nThe last but not the smallest strategy for development of geotourism and the local \n\neconomy is applying the geopark brand or eco-labels in geotourism marketing (in festivals, \n\npublications, research projects, common marketing, higher prestige, accommodations, \n\nrestaurants, educational programs, and local businesses).  \n\nAccording to Table 4.2.7 the majority (84%) of geopark authorities noted that geotourism \n\nmarkets take advantage of the geopark brand, and 68% of respondents filled in on the \n\nform that the geopark brand can play a role in the development of the local economy.    \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.7- Descriptive analysis of the role of geopark brands in the development of local \n\neconomy \n\nQuestions \nYes No \n\n       Percent \n\nThe geopark has a brand and logo of its own 100 - \n\nGeotourism markets take advantage of the geopark brand 84.0 16.0 \n\nThe brand plays a role in the development of the local \n\neconomy   \n68.0 32.0 \n\n \n\nAmong geoparks, Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany), Nature Park Eisenwurzen (Austria), \n\nNaturtejo Geopark (Portugal), Psiloritis Natural Park (Greece) Cabo de Gata - Nijar \n\nNatural Park (Spain), Naturepark TERRA.vita European Geopark (Germany),and Parco \n\nNaturale Adamello Brenta (Italy) more than other geoparks emphasize the use of the \n\ngeopark logo or eco-labels for promoting local businesses and geotourism; for example, \n\nthe Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta launched a project titled as \u201cQualit\u00e0 Parco\u201d. This \n\nproject tries to use the logo as a local environmental / marketing certification for hotels and \n\nlocal products. Moreover, the brand is used for agro-alimentary products as well.  \n\nAmong the geoparks, Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy) is the first geopark in Europe \n\nwhich obtained ISO 14001 certification; the park can also boast EMAS registration \n\n(Moranduzzo, 2008). Furthermore, currently, Geo-Naturpark Bergstra\u00dfe-Odenwald \n\n(Germany) is implementing ISO EN 9001 standards for the development of the \n\nmanagement framework and regional development (Eckhardt, 2011).  \n\nCabo de Gata-Nijar Geopark (Spain) implemented the European Charter for Sustainable \n\nTourism (ECST) in its territory and it uses accordingly the logo of the ECST for its \n\nactivities (Elviro et al., 2011).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n169 \n\nBesides, Naturtejo Geopark has close collaboration with a geo-bakery located in the \n\ngeopark, and has permitted them to use geopark brand on their geo-products as \n\nsouvenirs. Moreover, this geopark established a shop of the Earth (Loja Da Terra) in order \n\nto supply the geopark products. This shop can benefit from the geopark logo for its \n\nproducts.   \n\nAlso, in the Nature Park Eisenwurzen, geotourism markets and producers have common \n\nmarketing under Geo Line brand (local geopark brand).  \n\nIn addition, Psiloritis Natural Park (Greece) runs a project titled \u201cLand of Psiloritis\u201d; it is \n\ncarried out in cooperation with local stakeholders (taverns, accommodation places, \n\nagritouristic enterprises etc.) who apply the geopark logo as the brand name for a network \n\nof cooperating enterprises. Members have to fulfil certain quality standards that have been \n\nset in collaboration with the geopark and are evaluated every year by a common group of \n\nspecialists.   \n\nSome geoparks such as Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) and Cabo de Gata - Nijar Natural \n\nPark (Spain) use regional eco-labels as a badge of quality and environmental \n\nmanagement. Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) applied to the Eifel brand as a regional \n\nbrand for its activities. The Eifel region (Vulkaneifel Geopark) is a natural area with a \n\nunique character, known for its attractive landscape and as a region of origin of high-\n\nquality products with the new regional brand \u201ce\u201d which can be recognized directly by \n\nconsumers at the special quality of the Eifel. The brand logo is symbolized with a yellow \n\n\u201ce\u201d; this brand is a multipurpose brand and is used for agriculture, forestry, trade, tourism \n\nactivities, and local products.  \n\nMoreover, Cabo de Gata - Nijar Natural Park (Spain), in order to have sustainable \n\neconomic activities in the geoparks, applied the Nature Park of Andaluc\u00eda brand. The \n\nbrand can be used for handicrafts, nature tourism services and natural products (Villalba, \n\n2010).  The Nature Park of Andaluc\u00eda brand was promoted by the regional environmental \n\ngovernment of Andaluc\u00eda. \n\nViabono is a National tourism brand in Germany. Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita \n\nEuropean Geopark (Germany) has been qualified by this brand, and the Viabono brand \n\nguarantees the special experience of travel around the geopark.  \n\nFurthermore, North Pennines European Geopark (UK) has used The Green Tourism \n\nBusiness Scheme (GTBS) as an environmental accreditation for the geopark (North \n\nPennines Geopark Authorities, 2007). This eco-label is been designed to guide visitors in \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n170 \n\ntourism destinations and help them to select promoters of ecotourism products and the \n\nnew experiences which are offered by destinations. It is also designed to act as a \n\nframework for operators to adapt existing products to ecotourism or create new \n\necotourism products. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that some geoparks such as the Papuk Geopark (Croatia) believe \n\nthat the geotourism market has still not been developed in the country as it should be and \n\nthe authorities should try to introduce a geopark brand as a sustainable tourism brand. On \n\nthe basis of the results of this research, it can be concluded that geotourism marketing \n\nand the local economy can take advantage of geopark brands as well as eco-labels.   \n\n \n\n4.2.1.4.  Socio-Environmental Impacts of the Establishment of Geoparks \n\nAccording to some authors Strasser et al., 1995; Wimbledon, 1996; Reimold, 1999; \n\nHeitzmann et al., 2006; Reynard and Coratza, 2007; establishing geosites and geoparks \n\nare key components in geoconservation.  \n\nIn addition, some authors such as: Catana and Rocha, (2009), and Anderson and Brown, \n\n2010 argued that educational activities are the best means of preservation of geological \n\nheritage.  \n\nMoreover, Richardson and Shakespeare, 2009; and Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009; believe \n\nthat involving local communities in geopark conservation projects can be a strategy for the \n\npreservation of geological and geomorphological heritage.  \n\nThe goal of this section is to determine the role of the establishment of geoparks on socio-  \n\nenvironmental sustainability. This section tries to test the following hypotheses: \n\n\u2022 H1: Geoparks involve local communities in conservation activities \n\n\u2022 H2: Geoparks have positive socio-environmental impacts on local communities   \n\n\u2022 H7:Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employment \n\nof local communities in rural areas and geopark territories \n\nRegarding this, three open questions were designed for geoparks authorities, the first \n\nquestion designed to investigate the conservation activities in geoparks, the second \n\nquestion ask how geopark conservation improves the local economy and the third \n\nquestion evaluates the number of people involved in geopark conservation activities.   \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n171 \n\nOrganizing workshops managed by local communities is another strategy of geoparks for \n\nconservation and educational activities. Concerning this strategy, three closed questions \n\nwere designed: the first question evaluates whether geoparks organize workshops or not; \n\nthe second and third questions ask whether organizing workshops in geopark territories \n\npromotes the local economy.   \n\n \n\n4.2.1.4. 1.  Novel Strategies for the Conservation of Natural Heritage in Geoparks \n\nAs mentioned in the methodology section, the NVivo software was used in this study to \n\nanalyse the open question (Q1: what are the conservation activities) and the question two \n\ninvestigates how conservation of geoparks improves the local economy. These open \n\nquestions introduced strategies for conservation of geoparks. Applying NVivo software \n\nidentified the terms \u201clocal, geosite, educational and project\u201d as key concepts in \n\nconservation of geological heritage.  \n\nFigure 4.2.4 illustrates the percentage of coverage of the aforementioned terms in the \n\nanalysed record; and illustrates the most frequent terms in the analysed record. The term  \n\n\u2018local\u2019 shows the most frequency of usage and after that is \u201cgeosite\u201d with more frequency \n\nof strategies. Thus, locals play an important role in the conservation of geoparks, because \n\nno one knows the territory better than the local community. Moreover, finding, introducing, \n\nand establishing geosites are other strategies for the conservation of geoparks and unique \n\ngeological heritage. The word \u201ceducational\u201d has the third highest frequency, so an \n\neducational program is known as a way to conserve the geological or geomorphological \n\nheritage. \n\nIt is noteworthy that results of survey by means of NVivo software supported the \n\nexpectations of the literature review.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n172 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.4 - Results of qualitative analysis of open questions regarding conservation  \n\nstrategies for geoparks by using NVivo software \n\nIt is obvious that every geopark includes some geosites; and finding, introducing, and \n\nestablishing geosites are the first steps for geopark creation. Thus, according to the \n\nresults obtained by NVivo software, involving local communities in the conservation of \n\ngeoparks and providing educational projects are key factors in the preservation of \n\ngeoparks which are explained in detail below.        \n\n \n\n4.2.1.4. 2.  Involving Local Communities in Geopark Activities \n\nOn the basis of the results of NVivo software analysis and the literature review, geoparks, \n\nin order to conserve natural and geological heritage sites, utilizes the workforce and the \n\nknowledge of local communities in geopark territories.  \n\nAccording to the section 4.2.1.3.1, involvement of local communities in the conservation of \n\ngeoparks can be a strategy to improve the local economy; the majority (83%) of geoparks \n\nauthorities argued that the conservation of geoparks can create part time and second job \n\nopportunities for local communities (Figure 4.1.5).  \n\nAmong respondents only 15 geoparks replied to the question (How many people are \n\ninvolved in conservation activities?) results illustrated that the establishment of a geopark \n\nin each territory engages an average of about 11 persons in geopark conservation \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n173 \n\nactivities in the form of volunteering, supplementary income, part-time, full-time ,seasonal, \n\nand second job opportunities (Mean= 10.53, SD= 14.78). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.5- Percentage of geoparks which believe that the conservation of geoparks \n\nimproves the local economy  \n\n \n\nIn addition to examples mentioned in chapter two, respondents indicated their \n\nconservation activities as follows: Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) has organised \n\ncleanliness programs for schoolchildren and local communities, with the collaboration of \n\nenvironment related NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) such as the WWF. \n\nKanawinka Geopark (Australia) is another geopark which takes advantage of the local \n\nhuman workforce in conservation activities such as controlling weeds and pests in their \n\nterritory. And Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) involves the locals in preventing sheep \n\novergrazing. For instance the geopark encourages farmers to carry out special land \n\ncultivation in protected areas. It is noteworthy that most geoparks employ locals in \n\npreservation activities such as park guard and site surveillance. \n\nMeanwhile, some geoparks such as Naturtejo Geopark, Araripe Geopark, Sardinia, etc. \n\nbelieve that educational programs play an important role in geopark conservation and they \n\ntry to involve locals in educational activities and workshops.  \n\nThus, the next section will focus on educational activities and workshops in geoparks.   \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n174 \n\n  4.2.1.4. 3.  Educational Activities in Geoparks \n\nAs mentioned in the literature review, education as a fundamental prerequisite for the \n\nachievement of sustainable development is known as a conservation method in geology; \n\nthus holding workshops, establishing museums, thematic museums, thematic networks, \n\ninformation centres, geo-trails, providing geotourism maps, organizing geotours, guided \n\ntours, school class excursions, and outdoor laboratories, preparing maps, educational \n\nmaterials and displays, seminars, the annual conference of the European Geoparks \n\nNetwork and Global Geoparks Network and so on are strategies applied by geoparks to \n\neducate locals, children including schoolchildren, and tourists.  \n\nHolding workshops is not only a way to preserve the natural (geo and bio) and cultural \n\nheritage in geoparks, but also promotes the local economy through involving local \n\ncommunities in workshops. Regarding this, some questions (Table 4.2.8) were designed \n\nto inquire into the awareness of the role of workshops, which are being held in geoparks, \n\nin the local economy.  \n\nResults indicate that the majority of geoparks (72%) have been equipped with workshop \n\nfacilities and 56% of geopark authorities believe that workshops improve the local \n\neconomy through involving locals, artists, geologists, etc.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.8 - The role of workshops held in geoparks in the local economy \n\nVariable \nYes No No answer  Missing \n\n            Percent \n\nGeoparks have workshop facilities 72.0 28.0 0 0 \n\nWorkshops are managed by locals 68.0 28.0 4 1 \n\nWorkshops improve the local \n\neconomy \n56.0 36.0 8 2 \n\n \n\nA geopark organizes activities and provides logistic support to convey geoscientific \n\nknowledge and environmental and cultural concepts to the public. This is accomplished \n\nthrough protected and interpreted geosites, museums, information centres, trails, guided \n\ntours, school class excursions, popular literature, maps, educational materials and \n\ndisplays, seminars, and so on. A geopark also fosters scientific research and cooperation \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n175 \n\nwith universities and research institutes, stimulating negotiation between the geosciences \n\nand the local population. \n\nA plan for sustainable development in a geopark territory needs interdisciplinary studies \n\nand cooperation among universities, schools, kindergartens, museums, local authorities, \n\nand different stakeholders.   \n\nConsequently, educational activities exist in the core of geoparks' interests and \n\noperations; geoparks are open-air geological museums and can contribute significantly to \n\nenvironmental and cultural education programmes, offering excellent examples for the \n\ninteraction between the abiotic elements and biotic parameters in natural ecosystems. \n\nThey constitute natural outdoor laboratories where children can investigate earth \n\nsciences. Moreover, geoparks, by having locals participate in geopark conservation \n\nactivities and workshops attempt to improve the local economy of rural areas located near \n\ngeoparks.   \n\nIt is obvious that preserving geological and natural heritage is not possible without tourists\u2019 \n\nand local communities\u2019 awareness. Aside from examples mentioned in chapter 2 (section: \n\n2.10.1.2), each geopark has applied various educational activities and innovative \n\neducational tools which respondents mentioned in the questionnaires (Table 4.2.9).  \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.9 - Responses to educational activities in geoparks \n\nCountry/ Geopark name \n\nEducational \nprogram for \nschools and \nuniversities \n\nWorkshop publication Museum \n\nGreece (Psiloritis Natural Park) \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \n\n- Organizing field activities (Two special \u201cEducational Suitcases\u201d have been developed by the \nPsiloritis Natural Park that serve for environmental educational both indoor and outdoor.

Innovation and New Strategies in Geoparks \n\nAccording to Miller and Washington, 2009; innovation is an important factor in the \n\ndevelopment of geotourism. Geoparks, as the best paradigm in promoting geotourism, \n\nshould offer different facilities to visitors which they have never experienced in other \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n180 \n\ntourist destinations. This section attempts to discover policies and new strategies \n\n(innovation) pursued by the local government of geoparks in achieving goals of \n\nsustainable tourism for locals in rural areas. The following hypothesis was built to \n\ninvestigate innovation in geoparks: \n\n\u2022 H6: Geoparks promote geotourism through innovative strategies  \n\nDesigning a question in the questionnaire (Q = Are there some initiatives in promoting \n\nregional food and / or ecological products?) helped us to find out the innovation applied in \n\ngeoparks.  \n\nThis section focuses on innovative strategies of geoparks to achieve three targets \n\n(education, conservation and geotourism development) in five innovation categories \n\nmentioned by Hjalager (2002).  \n\nSince management innovation is one of the five categories of innovation and network \n\nactivity is a form of management and collaboration in recent decades, another \n\nquestionnaire was distributed to all geoparks registered (N=66) in UNESCO Global \n\nGeoparks Network to investigate the relationship between members of GGN and EGN.  \n\nThis phase was conducted from October to November 2010 and nineteen geopark \n\nauthorities filled in a form. The Social Network Analysis technique was used, and the \n\nnetwork was designed by means of Pajek as a visualisation program.   \n\n \n\n4.2.1.5.1.  Production Innovation \n\nProduction innovation consists of new products or services developed to the stage of \n\ncommercialization. Their novelty should be evident to producers, suppliers, consumers or \n\ncompetitors. Loyalty programs, events based on local traditions, and environmentally \n\nsustainable accommodation facilities are examples of production innovation in recent \n\nyears. The tourism product is a complete experience, encompassing everything from the \n\ntime a tourist leaves his home to the time he returns back (Weiermair, 2006). \n\nRegarding this definition, traditional festivals, regional fairs, geopark themed competitions \n\n(Appendix 35), geo-products, geo-sports, rural accommodation, geo-restaurants, geo-\n\nbakeries, georiums, geopark calendars, geopark flags (e.g. Stonehammer geopark flag, \n\nCanada), geological gardens, stone forests, print media (publications and books), and \n\neducational programs are new products in geoparks.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n181 \n\nHowever, geoparks can participate in socioeconomic and sociocultural developments of \n\ntheir territory and surroundings through collaborating with locally-based small and \n\nmedium-sized enterprises. Geoparks include new products and services, ranging from \n\ninterpretative provision to souvenir manufacture and leisure-related activities (geo-sports, \n\nlike cycling and climbing) (Hose, 2007).  \n\nCurrently, most of the local productions are linked to the geopark activities to introduce \n\ngeological elements. Taking as examples: the Geococktail (Vulkaneifel Mineral Water \n\nCocktails) in Vulkaneifel European Geopark (Germany); the dinosaur bread in Hateg \n\nCountry Dinosaurs European Geopark, (Romania); the ammonite chocolate and the \n\nammonite bread in R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence European Geopark (France) \n\n(Appendix 36); the trilobite cookies (Appendix 37) in Naturtejo European Geopark \n\n(Portugal), and the Pedras Parideiras in Arouca European Geopark (Portugal).  \n\nThese innovative products not only improve the local economy and present the local \n\nproducts but also educate tourists and popularize geological science. For instance, \n\nPedras Parideiras cakes existed well before the establishment of the Arouca Geopark. \n\nThis geopark is very important because of Pedras Parideiras rocks.  Although it shows the \n\nimportance of the area, before the establishment of Arouca Geopark, visitors and local \n\npeople learned almost nothing about this geological heritage besides curiosity about their \n\nexistence. Therefore it can be said that geo-products must be more communicational and \n\npedagogic tools. \n\nIn geoparks, local products and handicrafts should become close to trade marking and \n\nshould be designed based on geoparks\u2019 environmental and cultural elements. These \n\nproducts may be used in decorative or utilitarian ornaments, commemorative goods made \n\nof stone or wood, furniture, toys for children, and clothes. Trilobite clocks as a decorative \n\ngeo-product in Arouca Geopark (Portugal) can be a good example in this regard.   \n\nThe geo-products would certainly stimulate locals for new economic activities in the region \n\nof the parks.  \n\nGeo-menus and geo-food such as boulder soup and Orogenic toasts, earth slices (plate \n\ntectonic pizzas) served in the geo-restaurant (Petiscos e Granitos) and geo-bakery (Casa \n\ndo Forno) of Naturtejo Geopark are also innovative products in geoparks.  \n\nSignposts, which refer to geotourism maps, interpretative panels, leaflets, and so on, are \n\nother tourism facilities (products) which geoparks offer to their visitors.  \n\nThe establishment of a geological garden is another innovation in some geoparks such as  \n\nCopper Coast European Geopark. It is noteworthy that botanic gardens offer various kinds \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n182 \n\nof plant species to visitors, and a geological garden located in the Copper Coast Geopark \n\nexhibit various kinds of the rocks in this territory.  \n\nAs Gray (2008) argued, some sports and leisure activities are based on topography, and \n\nare named as geo-sports or geo-leisure activities. Geoparks also supply some \n\nrecreational facilities such as geo-sports and fun and adventurous activities. In geoparks, \n\nmost sports, (geo-kayaking, geo-bike cycling tour to discover the geological heritage \u2013 \n\ngeo-hiking, and geo-rafting) are related to earth topography and geology. Regarding geo-\n\nrecreational activities, the Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal) has designed a trilobite \n\nswimming board (Appendix 38) for tourists who desire to swim in the pool with a long-\n\nextinct animal.  \n\nAll the above mentioned innovative strategies demonstrate that this is the art of geoparks \n\nthat, through innovation, offers knowledge and recreation to tourists. These innovative \n\nstrategies in geoparks are key factors in rural development through involving locals in \n\ngeotourism marketing and geopark activities.  \n\n \n\n4.2.1.5.2.  Process Innovation \n\nProcess innovation involves a way of raising the performance of existing operations with \n\nnew or improved technology or through redesigning the entire production line (Hjalager, \n\n2002). These kinds of innovation can be combined with or result in product innovation. \n\nNew technologies have resulted in development of new skills, new materials, new \n\nservices, and new forms of organization. This has been especially true in the last two \n\ndecades, in which technological innovation has played a crucial role. In tourism, \n\ntechnology has created a new form of business called \u201ce-tourism\u201d which is today the most \n\nsuccessful form of \u201ce-commerce\u201d. For instance geoparks use new means of promotion of \n\ntheir products (conferences, events, fairs, workshops, etc.) in social networks such as \n\nFacebook.  Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), Arouca Geopark (Portugal), Langkawi Geopark \n\n(Malaysia), English Riviera Geopark, Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania) and \n\nso on designed a page on Facebook. Through Facebook they invite many members to \n\njoin their groups and introduce and supply their products to members. \n\nSupplying and selling products through online shops are other new technologies which \n\ngeoparks such as Papuk Geopark (Croatia), Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), Arouca \n\nGeopark (Portugal), and so on, have applied for promoting their products.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n183 \n\nSince the media can play an important role in tourist attractions, the Global Geoparks \n\nNetwork and European Geoparks Network have set up a corporative channel TV \n\n(Geopark online TV). Geopark TV was established in 2008 with 6 partners - ADRIMAG - \n\nLAG (Portugal), Lesvos Local Development Company S.A. - LAG (Etal S.A.) (Greece), \n\nMercury Mine in Closed Idrija (Slovenia), Natural History Museum of Lesvos' Petrified \n\nForest (Greece) and North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) (United \n\nKingdom). The main objective of Geopark TV, as an innovation, can be promoting \n\ngeoparks and geotourism and fostering the establishment of networks and technology \n\ninnovation. Geopark TV will allow partners to the exhibit natural and cultural heritage of \n\ntheir territories and share their knowledge for a better management of geoparks. Providing \n\nthe Marble Arch Caves Virtual Tour (UK) is another example of process innovation in \n\ngeoparks.    \n\nBesides this, geoparks provide new and innovative facilities for education and tourist \n\nguides. TERRAGAZE mobile (Appendix 39), which was mentioned before, will be a new \n\nfacility in Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal). Naturtejo Geopark is applying TERRAGAZE \n\nmobile as a field guide which is supported by GPS. It is a portable multimedia system \n\ndirected specifically at geotourism and geoscience education. When the visitor is passing \n\nthrough a geosite, specific information is automatically displayed.   \n\nMoreover, Lochaber Geopark (Scotland) is working on mobile phone interpretation \n\nmaterial for the geopark.  \n\nA text message system is used in Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita the system is based \n\non short texts and dialogues that are read out to visitors regarding geology, earth history, \n\nand culture (Lehmkuhl and Kluttig, 2011).  \n\nUsing a 4D simulator and a series of facilities (satellites) scattered around Teruel province \n\nare other innovative strategies for the popularization of geology in the palaeontological \n\nmuseum of Maestrazgo Geopark, Spain (Alcala, 2011).  \n\nIn addition to new technologies, geoparks strive to redesign the entire production line as a \n\nway to reach sustainable development. It is noteworthy that Casa de Forno (geo-refuge) \n\nwhich is located in Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal) territory was an ancient \n\ncommunity oven (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009). In 2007, Casa de Forno was turned in to \n\nrural accommodation and a geo-bakery. In this rural accommodation, every room has a \n\nname related to local geological or cultural heritage and it has been decorated with \n\ngeological landscape pictures; furthermore, in the corridors and yard visitors can see a \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n184 \n\ncollection of stones and local handicrafts. The manager of the geo-refuge uses information \n\ntechnology systems to manage room availability by an e-booking system.  \n\nAlso, Bohemian Paradise European Geopark (Czech Republic) has provided traditional \n\ntransportation (steam locomotive) to facilitate travelling throughout the geopark territory.  \n\nConsequently, the above mentioned activities illustrate that geoparks, through producing \n\ngeo-products, applying new technology and redesigning the entire production line, find \n\nways to introduce geoparks as new tourism destinations by reinforcing images of the past \n\n(traditional culture, geological processes, and so on).  \n\n \n\n4.2.1.5.3.  Management Innovation \n\nNew job profiles, collaborative structures, and authority systems belong to this category of \n\nmanagement innovation, often in combination with introduction of new products, services, \n\nand production technologies. \u201cInnovation requires entrepreneurship through which \n\nsomebody struggles to realize the idea as a business idea\u201d. Entrepreneurs are often \n\ndescribed as people who \u2018do something new\u2019 and thus create new value (Wickham, 2004) \n\nand growth (Ioannides and Petersen, 2003).  \n\nResults of research indicate that developing geotourism in geoparks can generate new job \n\nopportunities, new economic activities, and additional sources of income, especially in \n\nrural regions. Moreover, a geopark stimulates local socioeconomic activities by attracting \n\nan increasing numbers of visitors. It encourages production of local products and local \n\nhandicrafts involved in geotourism and geo-marketing such as geo-products. \n\nEstablishing geo-restaurants, geo-bakeries, family guest houses and rural \n\naccommodation, organizing geological education programs (for children including \n\nschoolchildren) and geotours, holding workshops, regional fairs, and festivals, involving \n\nlocals in conservation activities, engaging locals in surveillance of geosites or leadership \n\nin geopark museums are new job opportunities which directly emerge through geotourism \n\nand geopark activities.  \n\nAside from new job profiles, management innovation gives emphasis to collaborative \n\nstructures such as network activity.   \n\nIt is worth mentioning that geoparks are established at an international level but managed \n\nat a local level and network activities (Figure 4.2.6) play an important role in geopark \n\nmanagement. All experts believe that the most promising vehicles for innovation are \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n185 \n\ncooperation, alliances, and/or networking in various fields such as technology, marketing, \n\ndistribution, and human resource sharing. \n\nCreating a national or local network or forum is the best way that some geoparks have \n\napplied to reach their goals (education, conservation, and geotourism). \n\nBesides the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network, Asia-Pacific Geoparks Network, and \n\nEuropean Geoparks Network activities, some countries such as Japan, France, Germany \n\nand China have developed the National Geoparks Network and new National Geoparks \n\nFora. These networks are appearing to create close collaboration between geoparks, \n\ntourism sectors, schools, universities, and businesses. Thus, the national network and \n\nfora not only provide an opportunity for exchange of knowledge but also encourage locals \n\nand private sectors to participate in geopark activities. \n\nThemed networks among European Geoparks, such as the Volcanic Group, the Fossils \n\nGroup or the Coastal Group are scientific networks and have a vital role for better \n\nmanagement of geoparks and exchange of knowledge.   \n\nConsequently, geoparks through geotourism \u2013 \u201cas a niche marketing (special interest \n\ngroups) with geological interest\u201d \u2013 encourage innovative firms to achieve economies of \n\nscope, innovating on the basis of cooperative alliances and other forms of networking.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.6 - Dynamic model in geoparks, (Source: own construction) \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n186 \n\n4.2.1.5.3.1.  Network Analysis in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network  \n\nAccording to some authors (Lowe et al., 1995; Day, 1998; Murdoch, 2000; Sobels et al. \n\n2001; Ag\u00eancia Desenvolvimento Tur\u00edstico, 2008; Lee et al., 2005; Chris et al., 2005; Hall, \n\n2005; Romeiro and Costa, 2010) network activity can help to maximize the sustainability \n\nof employment, stimulate processes of social innovation and provide an opportunity for \n\nexchange of knowledge.  \n\nSince network activities are a management innovation in geoparks and the European \n\nGeopark Network and the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network introduced the network \n\nconcept to geo-sciences and geotourism, this part of the study tries to discover the areas \n\nof collaboration between geoparks by comparing nineteen different geoparks as \n\ngeotourism destinations in Europe, Asia, and Australia.  \n\nRegarding this, an e-survey as a new category of questionnaire-based surveys (mail) was \n\nused. Besides the e-survey, a social network analysis technique was applied, and the \n\nnetworks were designed by means of Pajek as a network analysis tool and a visualisation \n\nprogram. An electronic questionnaire was designed for sending to authorities of geoparks \n\naround the world and data was gathered from October to December 2010. Questions 1 \n\nand 2 - With which geoparks does your geopark collaborate? And in which area? \u2013 \n\ninvestigated the collaboration between geoparks in the areas of: tourism marketing; \n\neducational activities; conservation programs; production of new products; exchange of \n\nknowledge; conferences; meetings, and others. \n\nBear in mind that the number of geoparks registered in GGN was 66 until October 2010. \n\nAccording to the 9th European Geoparks Network conference in Lesvos Island (Greece) \n\nthe number of geoparks increased to 77 in 24 countries.   \n\nSince data for this part of study was collected over three months (from October to \n\nDecember 2010), it is obvious that the former geoparks had no collaboration with the 11 \n\nnew geoparks for these 3 months. Thus we exclude the new geoparks (n=11) from the \n\npopulation (N=77), including, however, an aspiring geopark (Hong Kong) located in China. \n\nThis exception is justified due to the existing collaboration between this geopark and \n\nItoigawa Geopark in Japan, and Yandangshan Geopark in China. Therefore, we end up \n\nwith 67 geoparks (Figure 4.2.7). Nineteen questionnaire responses were received (28%). \n\nThe majority of responses were collected in Europe (68%), and the others were from \n\nChina, Australia, Iran, Malaysia, and Japan (Table 4.2.11, Figure 4.2.7).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n187 \n\nOur network illustrates that the number of links are 501 and nodes (geoparks) are 67. The \n\nnumber of disconnected nodes is 13 (Table 4.2.10 and 4.2.11).  \n\nFor N number of nodes, Maximum Connectivity of the Network (MCN), Network \n\nConnection Rate (CN), and the number of connections (IC) are obtained by:  \n\nMCN= =           (1) \n\nCN=                        (2)  \n\nIC=                           (3)  \n\nWhere, ni and n1 denote the number of links and the existing nodes respectively. Based \n\non the obtained measurements of network analysis (Network Connection Rate (CN = 0.2) \n\nand Maximum Connectivity of the Network (MCN = 2211)); network activity in the GGN is \n\nweak, and the Global Geoparks Network should try to expand network activities between \n\ngeoparks, especially those located in Asia and Asia-Pacific (Figure 4.2.7).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.7 - Network related to collaboration between UNESCO Global Geoparks Network \n\nmembers \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n188 \n\nTable 4.2.10 - Main characteristics of network analysis of the UNESCO Global Geoparks \n\nNetwork \n\nNumber of Nodes 67\n\nDisconnected Nodes 13 \nNumber of edges - \nDensity1 [loops allowed] \n \n\n0.0449989 \n\nDensity2 [no loops allowed] \n \n\n0.0456807 \n\nAverage Degree 6.0298507 \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.11 - Network indicators for UNESCO Global Geoparks Network members who \n\nreplied to the questionnaire \n\n \n\nNO Geopark IC=  \n\nN=67 \n\nLinks \n\n1 Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark 0.51 103 \n\n2 Vulkaneifel Geopark 0.6 85  \n\n3 Swabian Alb Geopark 0.47 69 \n\n4 Geopark Shetland 0.33 36 \n\n5 Papuk Geopark 0.33 32 \n\n6 Naturtejo Geopark 0.2 25 \n\n7 R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence 0.15 23 \n\n8 Psiloritis Natural Park 0.09 22 \n\n9 Magma Geopark 0.18 21 \n\n10 Arouca Geopark 0.11 17 \n\n11 Kanawinka Geopark 0.09 14 \n\n12 Gea Norvegica Geopark 0.09 11 \n\n13 Sobrarbe Geopark 0.17 11 \n\n14 Qeshm Geopark 0.09 6 \n\n15  Leiqiong Geopark 0.03 6 \n\n16 Yandangshan Geopark 0.03 6 \n\n17 Langkawi Geopark 0.09 5 \n\n18 Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark 0.04 5 \n\n19 Itoigawa 0.03 4 \n\nTotal 0.81 501 \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n189 \n\nAll of the geoparks participate in activities such as holding GGN conferences, and/or EGN \n\nconferences every year. In addition, all of the geoparks are involved in writing chapters for \n\nbooks related to geoparks and geotourism activities. \n\nOur results also investigated the areas of collaboration between geoparks (Table 4.2.12). \n\nFurther analysis demonstrates that among geoparks, Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark \n\n(UK) with 103 links (Table 4.2.11) is the leading geopark in network activity. As well as \n\ncollaboration in the areas of tourism marketing, educational activities, conservation \n\nprograms, the production of new products, exchange of knowledge, conferences, and \n\nmeetings, Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark joined EU projects with Nature Park Terra \n\nVita (Germany), Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) and Geopark Bergstrasse-Odenwald \n\n(Germany). Moreover, Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark has collaboration with \n\nLangkawi Geopark (Malaysia) in the field of exchange of knowledge in schools. \n\nFurthermore, Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark works with aspiring geoparks and gives \n\nthem advice and information. This Geopark has acted as host for future geoparks; for \n\ninstance, some new or proposed geoparks such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada and \n\nIreland visited this geopark in order to gain experience and information. This geopark is a \n\nmember in advisory missions and gives practical advice to aspiring geoparks.  \n\nVulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) with 85 links is the second most active geopark in the \n\nnetwork. Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) has collaboration with 42 geoparks, and the \n\nmajority of collaborations are in the fields of meetings and tourism marketing (Table \n\n4.2.12). Creating a print media for cross-marketing of participating geoparks by \n\nVulkaneifel Geopark and geoparks of Ireland and Britain is the first collaborative activity.  \n\nProviding a brochure for the target group of teachers containing information on Vulkaneifel \n\nGeopark together with other geoparks aiming to recommend those as destinations for \n\nschool trips, is another collaborative activity in this geopark. The production of common \n\nmaterial and common presentation for fairs, and participation with European geoparks in \n\nwriting a common coffee table book are enterprises of Vulkaneifel Geopark in Network \n\nactivities.  \n\nAside from meetings and tourism marketing, Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) is in \n\ncooperation with Papuk Geopark (Croatia), Petrified Forest of Lesvos Geopark (Greece), \n\nHateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania), and Cabo de Gata Natural Park (Spain) in \n\nthe field of the production of new products.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n190 \n\nSwabian Alb Geopark (Germany) with 69 links is the third most active geopark in the \n\nnetwork. The majority of its activities are focused on conferences and meetings. Geopark \n\nShetland (UK) with 36 links is the fourth most active geopark in the network.  \n\nIt is important to distinguish two kinds of clusters in geoparks: thematic clusters and \n\ngeographic clusters. A.P.G.G.N and EGN, which are under the umbrella of GGN, are \n\nexamples of geographic clusters. Moreover, there are seven thematic clusters in \n\nEuropean Geoparks such as: Volcanic, Karstic, Fossils, Glacial, Mining, Coastal, and \n\nTectonic cluster. For instance, the volcanic thematic network includes Geopark Shetland, \n\nPapuk Geopark, Bohemian Paradise, Vulkaneifel Geopark, the Petrified Forest of Lesvos, \n\nCabo de Gata Natural Park, and Lochaber Geopark; the Coastal thematic network \n\nincludes Geopark Shetland, the Petrified Forest of Lesvos, Gea-Norvegica Geopark, \n\nCopper Coast Geopark, Geo Mon Geopark, and English Riviera Geopark. These are \n\ncases in point of thematic clusters.  \n\nAccording to Table 4.2.12, the majority of collaboration in GGN is concentrated in the \n\nfields of meetings (Link=132), exchange of knowledge and conferences (both include 80 \n\nlinks). Consequently, it can be said that at present, exchange of knowledge is an \n\nimportant target in GGN activity. Moreover, development of tourism marketing (Links=65) \n\nis the fourth target of Network activities in GGN.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n191 \n\nTable 4.2.12 - Numbers of links in each field of collaboration for geoparks which replied to the \n\nquestionnaire \n\n \n\nGeoparks \nField of Collaboration \n\n ? ? \u2022 ? ? ? ? \u00d7 ? \nR\u00e9serve \nG\u00e9ologique de \nHaute-Provence \n\n3 5 - 1 2 3 3 - - 6 \n\nNaturtejo \nGeopark \n\n6 3 - 7 2 2 4 - - 1 \n\nArouca Geopark - 3 - - 4 4 5 - - 1 \n\nVulkaneifel \nGeopark \n\n39 - - 4 2 1 36 - - 3 \n\nSwabian Alb \nGeopark \n\n- - - - 2 29 29 - - 9 \n\nPsiloritis Natural \nPark \n\n- 3 - 2 4 5 5 - - 3 \n\nSobrarbe \nGeopark \n\n- - - - 1 4 6 - - - \n\nMagma \nGeopark \n\n- 2 - - 6 7 3 - - 3 \n\nGea Norvegica \nGeopark \n\n- - - - 4 2 3 - - 2 \n\nMarble Arch \nCaves Global \nGeopark \n\n7 9 6 7 31 12 18 - - 13 \n\nGeopark \nShetland \n\n5 2 - - 4 4 6 6 6 3 \n\nHateg Country \nDinosaurs \nGeopark \n\n1 1 - - 1 - - - - 2 \n\nPapuk Geopark 1 9 3 - 9 - 7 - - 3 \n\nKanawinka \nGeopark \n\n1 1 1 - 5 2 4 - - - \n\nQeshm Geopark - 1 1 - 1 - - - - 3 \n\nLangkawi \nGeopark \n\n- - - - - 2 - - - 3 \n\nItoigawa \nGeopark \n\n- 1 - - 1 1 1 - - - \n\nYandangshan \nGeopark \n\n1 1 1 - 1 1 1 - - - \n\nLeiqiong \nGeopark \n\n1 1 1 1 - 1 1 - - - \n\nTotal Numbers \nof links \n\n65 42 13 22 80 80 132 6 6 55 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   Tourism Marketing \n?

Network Analysis in the European Geoparks Network  \n\nThis section focuses on network analysis in European Geoparks by using the above-\n\nmentioned formulas and Pajek program tools.  \n\nAccording to the 9th European Geoparks Network conference in Lesvos Island, Greece, \n\nthe number of European Geoparks increased to 42.   \n\nData for this part of study was gathered from October 2010 to December 2010. The \n\nformer geoparks which had no collaboration with the 5 new European geoparks (n=5) for \n\nthese 3 months were excluded from the population (N=42). Therefore, we end up with 37 \n\nEuropean Geoparks (Figure 4.2.8). Thirteen questionnaire responses were received \n\n(35%) (Table 4.2.13).  \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.13 - Network indicators for European Geoparks Network members which replied to \n\nthe questionnaire \n\n \n\nNO.

There are no disconnected nodes in the EGN, and all of \n\nthe nodes are involved in network activities (Figure 4.2.8, Table 4.2.14). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n194 \n\nTable 4.2.14 - Main characteristics of network analysis of the European Geoparks Network \n\n \n\nNumber of Nodes 37\n\nDisconnected Nodes 0 \nNumber of edges - \nDensity1 [loops allowed] \n \n\n0.1468225 \n\nDensity2 [no loops allowed] \n \n\n0.1509009 \n\nAverage Degree 10.8648649 \n\n  \n\nOn the basis of the results, it can be concluded that the EGN has concentrated its network \n\nactivity on the fields of meetings (links=122), conferences (links=68), and exchange of \n\nknowledge (links=65). In addition, the development of tourism marketing (links=56) is the \n\nfourth target of the establishment of the EGN (Table 4.2.15). \n\nAmong the European Geoparks, Vulkaneifel Geopark (links= 35), Marble Arch Caves \n\nGlobal Geopark (Links= 7), and Naturtejo Geopark (Links= 6) are more active than the \n\nother geoparks in the field of tourism marketing (Table 4.2.15). \n\nProduction of new products is an innovation in geoparks and the results of Table 4.2.15 \n\nindicate that Naturtejo Geopark (Links=7) and Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark \n\n(Links=7) are pioneers in collaboration in the field of the production of new products.  \n\nThere are 44 links regarding other kinds of collaboration. According to the questionnaires \n\nfilled in by respondents, these links refer to activities such as organizing European \n\nprojects, writing book chapters, organizing common presentations, holding common fairs \n\nand exhibitions, organizing field trips, and cultural projects. Figure 4.2.9 indicates that the \n\ncollaboration degree pattern of members in GGN is similar to EGN members and the \n\nmajority of network activities are devoted to EGN members.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n195 \n\nTable 4.2.15-Numbers of links in each field of collaboration for the European geoparks which \n\nreplied to the questionnaire \n\nGeoparks \nField of Collaboration \n\n ? ? \u2022 ? ? ? ? \u00d7 ? \nR\u00e9serve \nG\u00e9ologique de \nHaute-Provence \n\n3 5 - 1 2 3 3 - - 5 \n\nNaturtejo \nGeopark \n\n6 3 - 7 2 2 4 - - 1 \n\nArouca Geopark - 3 - - 3 2 4 - - 1 \n\nVulkaneifel \nGeopark \n\n35 - - 4 1 - 35 - - - \n\nSwabian Alb \nGeopark \n\n- - - - 2 29 29 - - 9 \n\nPsiloritis Natural \nPark \n\n- 3 - 2 4 5 5 - - 3 \n\nSobrarbe \nGeopark \n\n- - - - 1 4 6 - - - \n\nMagma Geopark - 2 - - 6 6 3 - - 3 \n\nGea Norvegica \nGeopark \n\n- - - - 4 2 3 - - 2 \n\nMarble Arch \nCaves Global \nGeopark \n\n7 9 6 7 27 12 17 - - 12 \n\nGeopark \nShetland \n\n3 2 - - 4 3 6 6 6 3 \n\nHateg Country \nDinosaurs \nGeopark \n\n1 1 - - 1 - - - - 2 \n\nPapuk Geopark 1 9 3 - 8 - 7 - - 3 \n\nTotal Numbers \nof links \n\n56 37 9 21 65 68 122 6 6 44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   Tourism Marketing \n?

Logistics Innovation \n\nThe development of internet marketing is classified as logistics innovation (Hjalager, \n\n2002). In most geoparks rural accommodations are equipped with an e-booking system; in \n\naddition, some geoparks supply their products to visitors through online shopping and \n\nvirtual tours on their web sites.  \n\nFor instance Kents Cavern is a famous and important Quaternary geosite in English \n\nRiviera Geopark (UK). This site is significant for studies in palaeontology. It is possible for \n\nvisitors to buy the ticket and find out more information easily online.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n197 \n\n4.2.1.5.5.  Institutional Innovation \n\nInstitutional innovation deals with collaborative and regulatory structures in communities in \n\nwhich public and private sectors cooperate together with new rules and regulations \n\n(Hjalager, 2002).  \n\nGeoparks stimulate development of the local economy through involving local \n\ncommunities and local private sectors in geopark activities. As a result, geopark takes \n\nadvantage of local knowledge for a better management of geoparks.  \n\nLocal communities and local business people benefit from the common logo of the \n\ngeopark, local environmental/marketing certification, and innovative ideas of geopark \n\nauthorities. For instance, officials of Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal) play a vital \n\nrole in consulting with locals and suggesting innovative ideas to them with the goal of \n\nimprovement of the economy in geopark territory. Naturtejo Geopark cooperates with \n\nprivate sectors such as health centres of natural spa, foreign and domestic active tourism \n\ncompanies, NGOs, hotels, restaurants, and rural hostels. \n\nIn addition, Psiloritis Geopark (Greece) runs a project titled \u201cLand of Psiloritis\u201d; it is carried \n\nout in cooperation with local stakeholders (taverns, accommodation places, agritouristic \n\nenterprises etc.) who apply the logo of geopark as the brand name for a network of \n\ncooperating enterprises. Members have to fulfil certain quality standards that have been \n\nset in collaboration with the geopark and are evaluated every year by a common group of \n\nspecialists.   \n\nThe Eifel region (Vulkaneifel Geopark) is a natural area with unique character, known for \n\nit\u2019s an attractive landscape and as a region of origin as high-quality products with the new \n\nregional brand \u201ce\u201d which can be directly recognized by consumers as the special quality of \n\nthe Eifel. It is symbolized with a brand logo with a yellow \u201ce\u201d; this brand is a multipurpose \n\nbrand and is used for agriculture, forestry, trade, tourism activities, and local products.  \n\nIt is evident from the five innovation categories that learning from the past can be a way \n\nfor building a sustainable future in geopark territories.  \n\nIt is obvious that geoparks require innovation in order to achieve sustainable development.  \n\nMoreover, creative ideas in geoparks could lead to improved quality, development of new \n\ncomputational paradigms, extension of some current frameworks, local socioeconomic \n\ndevelopment, local sociocultural development, environmental impact, etc. \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n198 \n\nIt was already clear in 19921 that innovation and change for the creation of a sustainable \n\nsociety cannot be achieved without active involvement at the local community level \n\n(Velasquez et al., 2005). There is widespread acceptance that sustainable development \n\nrequires participation of the community in practice as well as in principle. This is reflected \n\nin the text of Agenda 21, where the importance of local community action is mentioned in \n\nalmost all 40 chapters (Velasquez et al., 2005). Geotourism as an important marketing \n\nstrategy in geoparks requires innovation and it should not be viewed as an ordinary \n\nbusiness: some of the necessary innovations involve reforming internal management \n\napproaches to achieve constructive alterations: some concern new technologies; others \n\nare related to the nature of monitoring, regulation, and enforcement processes through \n\nglobally agreed standards and reporting mechanisms. Central to all these necessary \n\nchanges is the participation of stakeholders, especially local artists and local communities. \n\nMeanwhile, Schiller (2002) indicates that many clients in tourism marketing want to \n\ninteract with the local culture and wildlife of a destination.  \n\nThus, innovation and participation of local communities are two key components in \n\ngeopark management planning and geopark activities (Figure 4.2.10). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.10 - Targets of geoparks, (Farsani et al., 2012a)  \n                                                            \n1 Agenda 21 is a comprehensive plan of action for a sustainable future that was developed at the 1992 Rio \nEarth Summit. \n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n199 \n\nAccordingly, geoparks as new tourism destinations, through promoting geotourism and \n\napplying initiatives, find ways to popularize geological sciences, revive traditional culture, \n\nand promote local development. We have summarized the innovation of geoparks \n\nadapted from Hjalager\u2019s (2002) definition in the following Table (4.2.16).  \n\nTable 4.2.16- Innovation in geoparks adapted from Hjalager\u2019s (2002) definition \n\n (Source: Farsani et al., 2012a)  \n\nsub-division of innovation  \nHjalager (2002) \n\nsub-division of innovation in geoparks \n\n \n\nProduct innovation consists of \nnew products or services, \ndeveloped to the stage of \ncommercialization. \n\n \n\nProduction innovation in Geoparks  \n\n- Holding traditional festivals and regional fairs \n\n- Providing geo-products \u2013 local products which are related to \ngeopark activities or are the interpreted symbol of geological \nheritage of the geopark \n\n- Organizing geo-sports \u2013 sports which are related to Earth \ntopography: geo-rafting, geo-biking, climbing etc., as \nexamples \n\n- Establishing rural accommodation, geo-restaurants and geo-\nbakeries, providing georiums and geopark calendars. \n\n- Establishing geological gardens and stone forests, preparing \nprint media (publications and books)  \n\n- Organizing educational programs \n\n- Creating services and facilities for the development of \naccessible tourism; establishing a spa therapy centre in \ngeoparks such as Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita, Swabian \nAlb Geopark (Germany), etc; preparing a Braille book of \nNaturtejo Geopark (Portugal) for blind children and holding a \nworkshop for sightless children and students in Bohemian \nParadise (Czech Republic) can be starting steps for \ndevelopment of new services and production for accessible \ntourism market in these territories. \n\n \n\nProcess innovation involves a \nway of raising the performance of \nexisting operations with new or \nimproved technology or through \nredesigning of the entire production \nline. \n\n \n\nProcess innovation in Geoparks  \n\n- Promoting of their products (conferences, events, fairs, \nworkshops, etc.) in social networks such as Facebook. \n\n- Establishing Geopark online TV \n\n- Establishing online shops \n\n- Providing virtual tours (Marble Arch Caves Virtual Tour as an \nexample) \n\n- Preparing TERRAGAZE mobile as an electronic self-geotour \nguide \n\n- Using sustainable energy to reduce air pollution (Naturepark \nTERRA.vita (Germany) used E-bikes equipped with electric \nmotor to ease biking in hilly areas, the recharging stations are \nequipped with a solar panel to provide carbon free energy for \nthe bike batteries)  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n200 \n\nTable 4.2.16- Innovation in geoparks adapted from Hjalager\u2019s (2002) definition, (cont.)  \n\n(Source: Farsani et al., 2012a)  \n\nsub-division of innovation \n\n Hjalager (2002) \n\nsub-division of innovation in geoparks \n\n \n\nManagement Innovation \ninvolves new job profiles, \ncollaborative structures, and \nauthority systems.   \n\n \n\nManagement innovation in Geoparks \n\n- Establishing geo-restaurants, geo-bakeries, family guest \nhouses and rural accommodation \n\n- Organizing geological education programs (for schoolchildren \nand kids) \n\n- Establishing geotours \n\n- Involving  the local communities in workshops and regional \nfairs \n\n- Involving locals in conservation activities \n\n- Engaging locals in surveillance of geosites or leadership in \ngeopark museums \n\n- Developing network activities in rural areas and among \ngeoparks \n\n- Developing thematic clusters  \n\n- Developing twinning agreements or sister partnerships \nbetween geoparks \n\n \n\nLogistics innovation involves \ninternet marketing development \n\n \n\nLogistic innovation in Geoparks \n\n- Equipping rural accommodation with e-booking systems \n\n- Supplying their products via online shops or virtual tours  \n\n \n\nInstitutional innovation deals \nwith collaborative and regulatory \nstructures in communities in \nwhich public and private sectors \ncooperate together with new \nrules and regulations \n\n \n\nInstitutional innovation in Geoparks \n\n- Establishing the European Geoparks Network and Global \nGeoparks Network \n\n- Establishing the National Geoparks Network in some countries \nsuch as China and Japan  \n\n- Establishing a local Network of partners in each geopark \n(R\u00e9serve G\u00e9ologique de Haute-Provence Geopark Network \u2013\nFrance \u2013 taken as an example) \n\n- Involving the locals and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n(SMEs) in geopark activities (local business people benefit \nfrom the common geopark logo, local environmental marketing \ncertification, and innovative ideas from the geopark \nauthorities) \n\n \n\n4.2.1.5.6.

\n\nReynard (2008) noted that geotourists need different infrastructures, goods, and services \n\nto facilitate their visit (Figure 4.2.11). For example, cableways for accessing a remote \n\ngeosite (crater), interpretative panels, or guided tours are elements offered to geotourism. \n\nResults of the literature review of geoparks and questionnaires filled in by geopark \n\nauthorities indicated that providing facilities for geotourists are mostly an extension of the \n\nReynard model (Figure 4.2.12). Geoparks offer different facilities to tourists which they \n\nhave never experienced in other tourist destinations. Geotourism is a market that strives \n\nto provide unique experiences for visitors through initiatives. For instance, boat tours in \n\ngeoparks have added the geological story of the earth to their traditional interpretation. \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n210 \n\nMoreover, kayak tour guides are seeking information about geology to enhance their \n\nstories of the natural and cultural landscape. Trail designers are looking for geological \n\ninformation to develop interpretive signs along walkways. Tour operators working in the \n\ncruise ship market have considered tours of geological sites for ship passengers. Besides, \n\ngeo-products not only make an opportunity for tourists to experience new and local \n\nproducts, but increase their knowledge about geology as well.   \n\nLastly, providing new job opportunities, new accommodation, new facilities, and new \n\nproducts are initiatives of geoparks to attract more tourists to their territories.  \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.11- Typology of the derived geotourist offer (Source: Reynard, 2008) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n212 \n\n4.2.1. 6.   Summary and Conclusions \n\nGeoparks as open museums are established at International level but managed at local \n\nlevel; the clearest results of the investigation indicate that the majority of geoparks (52%) \n\nare managed officially, and in most countries geoparks (52%) are financially supported by \n\nlocal municipalities, therefore, geoparks do not function similarly in terms of management \n\n(H9).  \n\nSince the majority of geoparks are located in rural areas, geopark and geotourism are \n\nopportunities for cultural sustainability and rural development; they also reduce the rate of \n\nunemployment and emigration through engaging the local communities in geopark \n\nactivities.  \n\nGeoparks authorities try to improve the local economy through geotourism, education, and \n\nconservation activities. Geopark authorities have taken some positive policies toward \n\nstimulating locals in participating in activities leading to local economy prosperity, cultural \n\nsustainability and preservation of natural resources: \n\nFirstly, geopark authorities involve locals in conservation activities; creating a geopark in \n\neach territory engages an average of about 11 persons in geopark conservation activities \n\nin the form of voluntary, supplementary income, part-time, full-time ,seasonal, and second \n\njobs (Mean= 10.53, SD= 14.78). \n\nMoreover, the results indicate that the majority of geoparks authorities (83%) believe that \n\nconservation activities improve the local economy in their territory; for instance, geoparks \n\nemploy and involve locals in preservation activities such as conservation projects, park \n\nguards and site surveillance.  \n\nThe above results can confirm the first hypothesis (H1: Geoparks involve local \n\ncommunities in conservation activities). Accordingly, there is an interaction between \n\nsocioeconomic development and conservation of the natural environment of the geopark.  \n\nSince organizing educational activities is a means for preservation of natural heritage, a \n\ngeopark also fosters scientific research and cooperation with universities and research \n\ninstitutes, stimulating the negotiation between the geosciences and the local population. \n\nThe results also indicate that the majority of geoparks (72%) have been equipped with \n\nworkshop facilities and 56% of geopark authorities believe that workshops improve the \n\nlocal economy through involving locals, artists, geologists, etc. in workshops.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n213 \n\nAccordingly, findings confirmed the seventh hypothesis (H7: Geoparks contribute to \n\nincreasing the geological knowledge and employment of local communities in rural areas \n\nand geopark territories).  \n\nIn the second strategy, geoparks encourage locals to participate in tourism activities; the \n\nresults illustrate that the majority (80%) of respondents believe that involving local \n\nbusiness people in tourism marketing is the best way to promote the local economy; \n\nmoreover 68% of geoparks try to link their activities to other local tourism activities such \n\nas boating, bird watching, cultural activities, etc.   \n\nBesides this, geoparks with a view to the development of local economy strive to support \n\nthe local products and services through a label (36%) or direct marketing of regional \n\nproducts (36%).  \n\nIt is noteworthy that 48% of geoparks through creating second job or seasonal job for local \n\ncommunities attempt to generate supplementary income for them.  \n\nMoreover, the majority (84%) of geopark authorities noted that geotourism markets take \n\nadvantage of the geopark brand; for instance geoparks apply geopark logos as a local \n\nenvironmental/marketing certification for hotels, local products and souvenirs. Geoparks \n\nuse the logo for publications (geotourism maps, books, newsletters, monthly reports, etc.) \n\nand promoting geo-products. Thus, geotourism activities under the geopark brand create \n\nopportunities for local development.   \n\nThe geotourism an \u2018emerging tourism\u2019 niche is still at an early stage of commercial \n\ndevelopment, but in the near future geoparks will be known as geotourism destinations for \n\nthose who want to know more, and will be more active in the development of the local \n\neconomy.  \n\nIn the fourth strategy, geoparks \u2013 through promoting geotourism in their territory \u2013 strive to \n\nrevive traditional culture and decrease the negative cultural impacts of tourism.  \n\nFor sociocultural sustainable development, geoparks try to organize local markets for \n\nregional and agricultural products, to make souvenirs, to serve local food on tours, to hold \n\nworkshops, festivals, fairs, local dances, local music, and educational programs. \n\nMoreover, geoparks through innovative strategies strive to introduce the locals\u2019 traditional \n\nskills to tourists. For example, geo-products which are made based on geological \n\nelements of geoparks not only introduce the local products and the local handicrafts to \n\ntourists, but increase the public knowledge of tourists about geology. Thus, geotourism \n\n\n\nChapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level \n\n214 \n\nallows tourists and visitors to travel in their territory in order to get experience, learn from \n\nand enjoy our earth heritage.  \n\nBased on the results of the descriptive analysis, geopark activities promote regional food \n\nand craft businesses; the majority of the responders (80.0%) mentioned that geopark \n\ncreation plays a role in promoting local cuisine, products, and handicrafts as cultural \n\ncomponents.  \n\nAccording to the findings, geoparks attempt to revive traditional food, local arts, and \n\ntraditional culture through exposing them to tourists; thereby, geoparks, by promoting \n\ngeotourism and innovative strategies reduce negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in \n\ntheir territory. Consequently, geotourism can also contribute significantly to local cultural \n\npreservation, and the finding allows us to confirm H5 (Geoparks contribute to promoting \n\nregional geotourism products and local products) and H8 (Geoparks contribute to \n\nminimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism perceived by the local \n\ncommunities). This indicates that geoparks as pioneers in geotourism development can be \n\nconsidered as a sustainable base for the development of tourism.   \n\nFurther analysis illustrates that annually an average of 7.8 million geotourists visit \n\ngeoparks around the world. These numbers of geotourists in European Geoparks are \n\nabout average of 4.3 million per year. According to network analyses, among geoparks, \n\nVulkaneifel Geopark (links=35), Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark (Links=7), and \n\nNaturtejo Geopark (Links=6) are more active than the other geoparks in the field of \n\ntourism marketing.  On the basis of the results of network analysis of this research, it can \n\nbe concluded that Network activity in the EGN is stronger than in the GGN, and the GGN \n\nand EGN have concentrated their network activity on collaboration areas of meetings, \n\nconferences, and exchange of knowledge. In addition, geopark authorities attempt to \n\ndevelop tourism marketing in their territory. It can be said that the geoparks not only try to \n\npopularize the geological and geomorphological heritage and sciences, but also introduce \n\ngeoparks and geosites as new tourism destinations.  \n\nThe results can also provide some support for introducing geoparks as new geotourism \n\ndestinations in the near future. On the basis of the results of this research, it can be \n\nconcluded that geoparks, through promoting network activity, innovation and novel \n\nstrategies, try to offer new geotourism facilities to visitors and can increase visitors\u2019 \n\nknowledge especially in the field of geology, geography, geodiversity, and culture.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5- Sustainable Tourism in \nQeshm Geopark (Iran)  \n\n \nPart 1- Characterization of the Geographical \n\nArea of the Case Study \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n215 \n\n5.1.1.  Introduction \n\nExperiences gained from the literature review and chapter 4 are gateways and guidelines \n\nfor better management of the Qeshm Geopark. Innovative strategies and policies in \n\ngeoparks around the world can help us to discover strengths, weakness, opportunities and \n\nthreats in the Qeshm Geopark.  \n\nThis chapter explains the characterization of the geographical area of Qeshm Geopark as \n\na case study. It begins with a description of natural (geological, ecological) and cultural \n\nheritage in the geopark.   \n\nSince sustainable development indicators can lead to better decisions and more effective \n\nactions, indicators of Sustainable Development for Qeshm Geopark were collected in sec-\n\ntion 5.1.8. At the end, according to sustainable development indicators and experiences \n\ngained from geoparks around the world three SWOT matrices were designed for devel-\n\nopment of geosites, eco-sites and cultural activities in Qeshm Geopark.   \n\n \n\n5.1.2.  Qeshm Geopark (Iran)  \n\nQeshm Geopark with an area of 32000 hectares is located in the west of the Qeshm  \n\nIsland between the axes 26\u00b0, 44\u00b4, 62\"N\u201a and 26\u00b0, 35\u00b4, 00\"N\u201a and the meridian axes 55\u00b0, \n\n44\u00b4, 28\"E \u201a and 55\u00b0, 44\u00b4\u201a44\" E in the Persian Gulf, Iran (Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2005) \n\n(Figure 5.1.1).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.1- The location of Qeshm Geopark in Qeshm Island  \n\n(Source:  www.geocities.com) \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n216 \n\nThe average of annual precipitation in Qeshm is very low (163.4 mm) and the average \n\ndaily temperature is about 27\u00b0C. According to the Statistical Centre of Iran (2006) the total \n\npopulation of the Qeshm Geopark is about 17355 people who live in 19 villages. The \n\neconomy of the Qeshm Island is heavily dependent on fisheries, aquaculture, transporta-\n\ntion, and trade. The rural population who live in the surrounding villages of geopark earn \n\ntheir living by fishing, trade, and tourism.   \n\nQeshm Island Free Zone Organization was established in 1990 with the purpose of eco-\n\nnomic development, attraction of national and international tourists and entrepreneurship, \n\nimplementation of public services, and accomplishment of infrastructures enterprises in \n\nthe Island (Turner, 2008). Since the Qeshm Island Free Zone Organization was estab-\n\nlished, the structure of Qeshm Island transformed to duty-free status.  \n\nPursuant to sustainable tourist attraction, the establishment of Qeshm Geopark was an \n\nimportant step for the development of geotourism and improvement of local socioeco-\n\nnomic activities. Therefore, for the establishment of Qeshm Geopark, Darehshoori and \n\nDakhteh launched the initial research activities. Meanwhile, the primary geological report \n\nof Qeshm Geopark had been written by Haghipour et al, 2005 (Turner, 2008). After that, \n\nS. Turner as UNESCO advisory group of geoparks experts travelled to the Qeshm \n\nGeopark and prepared a report for UNESCO (Ziari et al., 2008). Finally, the Qeshm \n\nGeopark was registered in GGN (Global Geopark Network) in 2006 and became the first \n\ngeopark in the Middle East.  \n\nThere are eight major sites in Qeshm Geopark including: Chah-Kuh valley, the valley of \n\nStars, A'li Channel, Tandis ha valley, Shour valley, Namakdan caves and dome, Doulab \n\nand Koorkoora kuh. Furthermore, Kase salkh desert and the Roof of Qeshm are important \n\ngeological monuments in this territory. \n\nBeside the geological heritage sites, there is ecological and archaeological heritage in the \n\nQeshm Geopark.  \n\nThe management structure of Qeshm Geopark is semi-public administration and Qeshm \n\nIsland Free Zone Organisation supports it financially. The geopark has close collaboration \n\nwith UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) office in Tehran, Environment  \n\ndepartment, NGOs, and tourism sector.  \n\nAs the Qeshm Geopark was selected as a case study in this thesis, geology formations \n\nand geosites of the geopark were discussed in detail, after that the ecological heritage \n\n(fauna and flora) of the area were considered. Lastly, in order to investigate the Strengths, \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n217 \n\nWeaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of the Qeshm Geopark, SWOT analysis method \n\nwas used; SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) provides \n\ninformation in matching a firm's resources and capabilities to the competitive environment \n\nin which it operates.  \n\n \n\n5.1.3.  The Geological and Tectonic History of the Qeshm Geopark \n\nQeshm Island is located on the earthquake belt of the world. The north of the Persian Gulf \n\nincludes a part of the southeast of Zagros structural zone which has been deformed and \n\nfolded as the result of the last phase of Alpine Orogeny in Plio-Pleistocene. The geological \n\nformations of this belt may belong to the Late Precambrian to Cambrian and include \n\ndiapirs attributed to the Precambrian called the Hormoz Series, which has been active till \n\nnow with a trend toward upper formations at the earth level. According to the majority of \n\ngeologists, this region \u2013 from the tectonic point of view \u2013 has been active since the Late \n\nTertiary as the tectonic zone in the south part of the deformed forehead or the convergent \n\nbelt \u2013Mesopotamia and Persian Gulf region \u2013 along with the margins of the compression \n\nand collision plates of Iranian-Arabic plate. The region located in the southeast stretch of \n\nthe Persian Gulf along with Hormoz and Qeshm Islands can be identified by the structural, \n\nsediment logical and geological features such as the mainland \u2013 which is distant from it \u2013 \n\nwith 2.5 km width in the narrowest parts.  \n\nSea terraces of Tertiary sediments in Qeshm Island are partially accompanied by Quater-\n\nnary deposits; therefore, they have resulted from the compressive tectonic forces related \n\nto Alpine Orogeny. Quaternary sea terraces are often horizontally stretched, while having \n\na slight slope toward the sea. The older terraces, particularly those located on the anti-\n\ncline, have a steeper slope and some mild folding. The terraces are made of corals,  \n\nzoomorphic shells, and deposited marine settlements in the old coastal regions whose \n\nthickness varies from a few to 10 metres. As for the composition, they contain coral  \n\ndeposits, limestone, and sandstone which often cover the formation of the thicker yet \n\nweaker bedrock with a Duricrust surface (Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2005). \n\n \n\n5.1.4.  Geosites in Qeshm Geopark \n\n5.1.4.1.  The Valley of Stars \n\nBerkeh Khalaf village is located 5 kilometres from the island\u2019s south coast. In north of the \n\nvillage one of the masterpieces of hydro-aeolian erosion (caused by water and wind) can \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n218 \n\nbe seen. This site is outside the geopark area, but UNESCO has identified this site as one \n\nof the major sites, because of the existence of most beautiful geological and geomor-\n\nphological phenomena in this valley (Appendix 24).  \n\nThe geological formation is made by soft layers (Maren) which are very sensitive to  \n\nerosion. The initial plateau which still remains more or less intact is located at an altitude \n\nbetween 7 and 15 metres from the bottom of the valley and it is made of limy sand stone \n\nand fossil limestone.  \n\nThe valley is an ideal place for the study of different types of erosion. Meanwhile, this site \n\nis the best strolling and walking tour for tourists. The locals\u2019 income is generated by park \n\nguards on this site. Moreover, the valley of stars is a suitable place for astronomy, obser-\n\nvation of stars, night photography, and night camping. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the geological formation of the valley of stars is made by soft layers \n\n(Maren), which are very sensitive and brittle; one can expect some tangible changes to \n\noccur in its morphology after each rainstorm. In future the tourist\u2019s visits and mass tourism \n\nmay endanger this place, so controlling the number of visitors, selecting a path for tourist\u2019s \n\nwalking and hanging sign posts in this path are the best ways to prevent erosion of this \n\nsite caused by humans (Farsani et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\n5.1.4.2.  The Roof of Qeshm \n\nThe Roof of Qeshm is a quite high plateau dominating the island's north margin, which \n\nbegins from the central parts and stretches along westward. This plateau is named \"The \n\nRoof of Qeshm\" since it is the most extensive highland on the island and one can view \n\nmatchless landscapes from top of this viewing roof. The high-altitude parts of The Roof of \n\nQeshm are mainly made of hard limestone that includes many shells, and on its slopes \n\nand margins one can see high lands of brittle sandstone containing marl and silt which \n\nhave been intensely eroded. One of the best ways to the Roof of Qeshm passes by the \n\nTabl village through which \u2013 at the end of the road after a 15 minute walk and climbing up \n\nthe slopes \u2013 one can mount the plateau's surface.  \n\nHere one can find remnants of a ruined village which is called \"Kalat Koshtar\". In the ruins \n\nof \"Kalat Koshtar \", one can see traces of very regular ancient walls, residential areas,  \n\npolished rocky pieces, and some quite intact closed spaces, which are similar to animal \n\npens or barns and have a structure resembling those of drainage and sewerage systems.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n219 \n\nIn addition, there are some pieces of pottery and baked mud bricks in the ruins which \n\nprobably date back to the Islamic period. The interesting point there is the use of hard \n\nlimestone in the region's constructions, which have been supplied by the upper limy layers \n\nof the plateau.  \n\nThe existence of a water reservoir there suggests that in the past the natives of the two \n\nvillages of Tabl (on the north coast) and Salakh (on the south coast) used to use Qeshm \n\nRoof as summer and winter resorts during hot and humid months.  \n\nThe view of the Mangrove Sea Forest from above Qeshm Roof including the north coasts \n\nof Persian Gulf and the novel erosion scenes in south of the plateau is among the land-\n\nscapes which can keep people watching and contemplating for long hours; and maybe \n\none could proceed to put up a tent to stay overnight there looking at the stars (Amrikazemi \n\nand Mehrpooya, 2005). \n\n \n\n5.1.4.3.  Chahkooh Valley (Tectonic \u2013 Erosion Phenomenon) \n\nThe ChahKooh valley situated in the southeast of the East Chahoo village is approxi-\n\nmately 85 km from the town of Qeshm. \n\nIn the vicinity of the Chahoo Village, at the north border of the west of the Island, one can \n\nsee two crossed valleys with tall walls, which show quasi-karst morphology. On the bottom \n\nof one of the valleys extending from North to South, the south entrance is wider than the \n\nnorth side and shows a more or less U-shaped form. The valley gets less wide as it moves \n\nsouth, and at the end it becomes V-shaped so that one can hardly pass through it and \n\nthere is also little light (Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2006). These specifications are  \n\nsuggestive of the fact that the valley is the result of flooding. The valley walls show  \n\nnumerous trenches and erosion lines. Some of its trenches appear to be deeper and take \n\nspoon-shaped or funnel-shaped forms. The walls are mainly made of limy sandstone and \n\ndue to the existence of red marl, silt, and limy inter-layers one can see intense dissolution \n\nand erosion so that many small and big holes appear all along the valley wall (Amrikazemi \n\nand Mehrpooya, 2005).  \n\nThis strait, due to having quite high vertical walls, the existence of trenches, and parallel \n\nand deep erosion lines along with the various kinds of hemispherical and oval holes,  \n\nenjoys a very special beauty (Appendix 25).  \n\nBesides the tourism potential, there are very deep well-like pits where flowing waters, after \n\neach rainfall, gathers in the valleys and is used by region's dwellers. It seems the digging \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n220 \n\nof water wells, which are used by the natives, has followed the formation of the deep  \n\ndissolution holes and in fact the work of nature has been completed by man. In addition, \n\nalong the main valley and the crossed ones, we can see a narrow stream-like channel, \n\nwhich has been dug to lead the valley's waters into the well. So this valley is a traditional \n\nrain water harvesting system. This rain water harvesting system is one of the targets of \n\nsustainable development. Moreover, Chahkooh is a wonderful place for the study of  \n\ndifferent types of erosion.  \n\nUnfortunately, in some parts of the valley there are some mementos, which have been \n\ninscribed on walls by tourists that detrimentally affect the landscape. Moreover, in future \n\nthe tourist\u2019s visits and mass tourism may endanger this place; therefore a control of the \n\nnumber of visitors is the best way to prevent erosion of this site caused by humans.  \n\nBecause of high visiting demands on Nowruz holidays, Qeshm Island Free Zone Organi-\n\nzation has invested on some basic infrastructures including: rubbish bins, asphalt roads, \n\ntoilets, parking areas, guard kiosks, and signposts (Khademi, 2008). \n\n \n\n5.1.4.4.  Three Namakdan Salt Cave  \n\nCaves in some parts of the world are formed in a very soluble material: salt. The most sig-\n\nnificant of these caves are found in arid regions, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile,  \n\nIsrael, and Iran. Several expeditions of the Czech cavers have discovered the longest salt \n\ncave on Qeshm Island in the Southern coast of Iran, the 3N Cave, 6580 metres in length \n\n(Filippi, 2007). The 3N salt cave has developed in the SE part of Namakdan salt diapir in \n\nthe western part of Qeshm Island (Figure 5.2).  \n\nSalt Diapirs and salt caves, which are rare and unique phenomena in the world, have a \n\nhigh degree of importance in the creation of Qeshm Geopark and development of geotour-\n\nism in this region (Asadi et al., 2008). There are some unique and aesthetic underground \n\nphenomena in 3N cave including: micro climate, alluvial fan, meandering, salt speleo-\n\nthems, curved stalactites, shafts, waterfalls, chimneys, and a salt lake (Appendix 26). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n221 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.2 - The geographic location of 3N salt cave, Qeshm Geopark, Iran,  \n\n(Source: Asadi, et al., 2008) \n\n \n\nBeside their tourism potential, salt caves are used for relaxation and treatment of respira-\n\ntory tract diseases, allergies, and chronic bronchitis (Mahmoodi and Ramezani, 2008). \n\nThe unique microclimate in salt caves treats skin diseases such as psoriasis or acne. The \n\nair in the salt caves is enriched by particles of iodine, potassium, sodium, calcium, mag-\n\nnesium, selenium, bromine, and many other elements that are essential for the proper  \n\nactivity of the human organism.  \n\nNowadays, there are many artificial salt caves in the Czech Republic and Poland where \n\nwalls of these relaxation rooms are made of massive salt blocks and the floor is covered \n\nwith a 20 cm thick layer of salt. There is also a salt pillar, a waterfall, and air moisteners in \n\nthe cave. For children, there is a salt pit where they can play. Annually countless visitors \n\nspend their leisure-time in these artificial caves.  \n\nConsequently, after implementation of infrastructure and conservation methods in Qeshm \n\nGeopark these natural salt caves can be visited by tourists.  \n\nIn addition to tourism development, Namakdan diapir is a salt mine which can help locals \n\nin generation of income through salt extraction. Salt extraction is forbidden in 3N salt cave \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n222 \n\nsince it is one of the major sites of geopark, but local companies and people extract salt \n\nfrom other caves around the Namakdan diapir. \n\nFurthermore, salt caves and salt diapirs are unique geological phenomena; therefore  \n\ngeologists, speleologists, cave explorers, students, and researchers are the major visitors \n\nof this geopark site. However, at present there are not enough infrastructures for public \n\ntourists (asphalt path, interpretative panels, signs, etc.). In recent years as a result of  \n\nencountering tourist\u2019s visits and mass tourism, one Namakdan salt cave was damaged \n\nand many beautiful cubic crystals and stalactites were devastated. Moreover, entering the \n\nsalt dome surface as well as caves is extremely hazardous and can easily result in serious \n\ninjuries or even death of visitors. Hence, the local administration decided not to advertise \n\nthis geopark site before implementation of the infrastructures. \n\nRecently, the planning management is in the execution phase and a 3N salt cave hall was \n\nselected for visitors. For the attraction of tourists to this sensitive site, consulting with the \n\ncaver specialists who have researched on conservation methods and tourist facilities is \n\nvery important because salt domes, or salt caves, are an extremely dynamic environment \n\nthat changes very rapidly and needs control management.  \n\n \n\n5.1.4.5.  Tang-e-Ali Gorge \n\nTang-e-Ali gorge is located in the west part of the island \u2013 south of East Chahoo village \u2013 \n\nand generally extends along the north-south line. The gorge north entrance is about 2 km \n\nfrom the north coast via East Chahoo village, and while its mouth is initially wide, after  \n\ntravelling for less than 50m, it immediately becomes narrower.  \n\nAlso the thin layer of clay and marl on the gorge floor \u2013 in which so many cracks are ob-\n\nservable and show high viscosity \u2013 is a reason for the high rate of moisture in this gorge.  \n\nMany holes and trenches can be seen in the walls of the gorge which are hemispherical, \n\nspoon-like and niche-like shapes and are among the main elements of beauty in this \n\ngorge. The linear and niche-like trenches and furrows can be seen parallel at many points \n\nand the reason behind this is the dissolution and erosion which has occurred in the clay \n\nand marl inter-layers that are more susceptible to erosion than limy sandstone (the main \n\npart of the walls).  \n\nIn addition, the existence of clay and marl in these layers and their being spoilt by erosion \n\nhas created these hemispherical shapes. The rapid and whirling movement of water in \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n223 \n\ntimes of torrent is another factor, which led to erode the layers and created blade-like and \n\nwedge-like forms with sharp edges.  \n\nIn the walls of the gorge, one can see numerous small and big joints as well as a few \n\nfaults, which most probably are the result of the movements in the neighbouring salt \n\ndome. In the middle of the gorge, the course gets very rough and narrow and walls come \n\ntightly toward each other so that in some parts one should use one\u2019s hands to be able to \n\npass through. The gorge at its south end meets the southeast walls of the Namakdan salt \n\ndome and its course toward the south coast is completely different from the northward \n\ncourse; here the manifestations resulting from the outcropped salt dome are observable \n\n(Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2005). \n\n \n\n5.1.4.6.  Tandis ha Valley  \n\nAlmost throughout the island, one can find a wide array of beautiful phenomena created \n\nby water and wind erosion. This site is similar to the valley of Stars, but more extensive \n\nand the density of the phenomena congestion is lower but with more frequency. The Tan-\n\ndis ha valley, which is located approximately 75 km southeastern of Tabl village, is a typi-\n\ncal site for observation of erosion features (Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2005). Among \n\nthe numerous forms of erosion we can name the column erosion such as chimney rocks, \n\nmushroom-shaped, arched, global, kidney-shaped forms, small and big cones and pyra-\n\nmids, as well as the shapes similar to human profiles and different animals (Appendix 27).   \n\nBeside the Tandis ha valley there are many erosion features in other geopark geosites, for \n\ninstance the Koorkoora Kuh site, which is located near the Giyahdan village, encom-\n\npasses beautiful landforms with hills in the shape of pyramids. At this geosite, which is \n\nsituated adjacent to date palms and the ancient dam (Sasani dam), appears an attractive \n\npath for taking tours for a stroll.  \n\nIn addition, the Doulab geosite which is situated near the Doulab village with badlands on \n\nsedimentary foothills has created an attractive place for adventure tourism. The last but \n\nnot the least geosite is the Shour valley which is located near the Salakh village. This site \n\nhas a high potential for rural tourism; there are different scale erosion landscapes in the \n\nShour Valley. The sulphurous spring and traditional treatments by local people in this site \n\nare other tourist attractions in this territory.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n224 \n\nIt is worth mentioning that springs of the Qeshm Island are salty and they have no fresh \n\nwater. Kargah is known as an important sulphurous spring and Goori as a salt spring in \n\nthis geopark.  \n\n \n\n5.1.5.  Qeshm's Coasts \n\nApart from Simin Beach, which provides suitable entertainment facilities by a calm sea as \n\nwell as a beautiful less steep coast, Qeshm has various intact coasts, which may welcome \n\npeople with a variety of tastes. Namakdan mount which near the coast, due to being rich \n\nin shiny particles of Oligist, which have been accumulated on the very cream bed of fine \n\ngrains of sand, has become a shiny and silvery coast.  \n\nVarious ripple marks in some parts have covered a distance about 50m without any  \n\ndisruption and diversion, which is itself suggestive of the sea\u2019s peacefulness, lesser \n\nsteepness, and homogeneity in the kind and size of the coastal sands.  \n\nThe coastal terraces can also be seen in different regions. Because of the terraces walls \n\nbeing so hard, the erosion factor has affected them less, therefore one can see a rocky \n\nface full of jagged edges. The crashing of waves on these walls and the rocks' firmness \n\nand steadiness are associated with the everlasting fight between the sea and the coast.  \n\nThe crustacean accumulation of various species of bivalves, gastropods, and particularly \n\ncrabs in these regions show the untouched of coasts whose natural visage is a point of \n\ninterest. Generally, the south coasts of Qeshm Island can be considered as the most \n\nbeautiful and most intact coasts in the Persian Gulf. \n\nFurthermore, watching the droves of camels near coasts of the Persian Gulf and roads of \n\ngeopark is another tourist attraction which is unique among the other geoparks.   \n\n \n\n5.1.6.  Ecological Resources  \n\nBeside the geological sites, the Qeshm Geopark has variety in ecological sites. There are \n\nfour major ecological sites in the Qeshm Geopark including: Harra sea forest, coastal \n\ncoral, coastal Hawksbill turtles, the natural aquarium, and dolphin settlement. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n225 \n\n5.1.6.1.  Noteworthy Fauna  \n\nVarious insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals live in Qeshm. Among the mammals,  \n\ngazelles, camels, and dog-foxes are famous in this area. More than 50 species of bivalve \n\nmolluscs, gastropods, cephalopods, echinoids, and corals can be found on the Qeshm \n\ncoasts. There are different kinds of shrimps, shells, sea urchins, sea porcupines, and sea \n\ncucumbers in the Qeshm waters. Moreover, a type of amphibian known as Gel-Khorak \n\n(Boleophthalmus dussumieri Valenciennes) can be found in the mangrove sea forest.   \n\nThe number of migratory bird species in the island reaches 70. The mangrove sea forest \n\nis an important breeding site for herons and numerous species of plover (Charadriidae) \n\npass through the area on migration. During the winter the mangrove sea forest is an  \n\nimportant feeding site for herons, plovers, and sandpipers (Scolopacidae) including the \n\ngrey heron (Ardea cinera), redshank (Tringa totanus), Terek sandpiper (Xenus cinereus), \n\nbar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica), and curlew (Numenius arquata). This site is even \n\nmore important for the wintering flocks of Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), spoon-\n\nbills (Platalea leucorodia), and greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber). Marine turtles \n\nsuch as green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), \n\nthe finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), the humpback dolphin (Sousa chinen-\n\nsis), and the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) are regularly seen in the area.  \n\nThe green turtle, the Dalmatian pelican, the cab plover, and the curlew are endangered \n\nspecies (UNESCO, 2008). The variety of fishes in the waters surrounding the Island is \n\nvery wide and different kinds of commercial, aquarium fishes and ornamental fishes as \n\nwell as sharks and whales can be found in the Persian Gulf. During the summer they lay \n\neggs on the coasts neighbouring the Shibderaz or Namakdan mounts (Amrikazemi and \n\nMehrpooya, 2005).   \n\nMoreover, ecotourists can watch the Qeshm eagle in this geopark. The biodiversity of \n\nQeshm illustrates that this geopark has high potential for recreational activities such as \n\nbird watching, wildlife watching, scuba diving, and snorkelling.  \n\n \n\n  5.1.6.1.1.  Hawksbill Turtles  \n\nFor thousands of years, marine turtles have been a source of food and sustenance for \n\ncoastal communities in tropical and subtropical regions. Human activities, overexploitation, \n\nfisheries by catch, and habitat destruction have been identified as the main reasons for \n\nmarine turtle decline (Spotila et al., 2000).   \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n226 \n\nToday, six of the world\u2019s seven species of marine turtle are classified as endangered \n\n(Tro\u00ebng, and Drews, 2004). Hawksbill turtles as endangered species are most commonly \n\nfound in hard-bottomed and reef habitats containing sponges (Edelman, 2004). \n\nThe Shibderaz village which is located in the centrally- southern coastline of Qeshm  \n\nIsland, is currently the only stretch used  in the entire Island by Hawksbill Turtles (Eretmo-\n\nchelys imbricata) for nesting and laying eggs. This site has been selected as a major  \n\necological geopark site.  \n\nThe sea turtles of Iran are all mentioned in the CITES list (Convention on International \n\nTrade in Endangered Species), and their hunting and sale is legally forbidden. The Envi-\n\nronmental Protection Organization is responsible for protecting regions where turtles lay \n\ntheir eggs. Fortunately, studies related to the egg-laying zones and the identification of the \n\nspecies have been completed in recent years (Daanehkaar, 1998). \n\nIt is worth mentioning that consumptive use of marine turtles for meat, oil, leather and \n\nshell, is unusual in peripheral areas of the Qeshm Geopark but the eggs are endangered \n\nby dog-foxes and illegal human activities.  \n\nThe Shibderaz Village coastline is an important  and strategic Hawksbill hotspot, and in \n\n2002, the Bureau of Environment and Qeshm Free Zone Area (QFA) received reports  of \n\nHawksbill Turtles laying eggs near Shiebderaz Village; hence, Bijan Darehshoori, director \n\nof Qeshm department of Environment (2001), with the help of indigenous people and \n\nUNDP, changed Qeshm into an environmentally sustainable Island (Turner, 2008). He  \n\nencouraged and engaged locals in collecting and protecting the eggs (Appendix 28). His \n\nenterprises brought sustainable use and recycling for the turtle hatchery (UNDP 2003a).  \n\nAt present, the environment department has an important role in the management struc-\n\nture of the Qeshm Geopark. It tries to encourage locals to participate in conservation  \n\nactivities of this geopark site and take advantage of indigenous knowledge. Aside from \n\nlocal involvement in conservation of turtles, the Qeshm Geopark authorities try to train  \n\nlocals as tour guides for turtle watching tours, which is a strategy for the development of \n\necotourism and geotourism in this area.   \n\nIt is evident that, local economic development and conservation issues are therefore  \n\ncomplex; conservation strategies to recover marine turtles must embrace local economic \n\nbenefits, so engaging stakeholder groups in tourism and involving local people in conser-\n\nvation projects are important strategies in local economic development. In recent decades, \n\nregarding the economic potentials of marine turtles, their non-consumptive use in the form \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n227 \n\nof tourism to observe marine turtles in-water and on nesting beaches has gained popular-\n\nity throughout the world.  \n\nWith reference to Dodds (2006), tourists were travelling to Rantau Abang in Malaysia to \n\nwatch nesting leatherback turtles as early as in the 1960s. In the 1980s, tourism to  \n\nobserve marine turtle nesting began in the Turtle Islands Park in Sabah, Malaysia, and in \n\nTortuguero National Park, Costa Rica. Recently, 8,450 and 32,854 tourists, respectively, \n\nvisited these sites each year to observe marine turtles nesting.  \n\nIn the 1990s and during the first years of this century, marine turtle tourism has become \n\npopular at many sites in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Each year, more than 175,000 \n\ntourists participate in marine turtle tours. The St. Lucia Heritage Tourism Programme  \n\nannounced a 100% increase in one year for turtle watching tours. The operator declared a \n\ngain of US$27,000 in 2005 up from US$13,500 in 2004.   \n\nIn addition, gross revenue for non-consumptive use can be estimated, by multiplying tour-\n\nist expenditure by the number of tourists participating in sea turtle watching. For locations \n\nwhere marine turtles represent a major generator of revenue, the estimate includes all  \n\nexpenditure (food, souvenirs, accommodation, transport and other costs) incurred by  \n\ntourists during their time at the turtle-watching sites.  \n\nTheoretically, marine turtle tourism can stimulate people to travel abroad and hence cause \n\nan increase in international travel and augment resource use.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that tourism development can have both positive and negative impacts on \n\nturtles. In Rantau Abang, uncontrolled tourism in Malaysia affected the behaviour of nest-\n\ning leatherback turtles. On Zakynthos Island, Greece, lights from hotels, restaurants, and \n\ncompacting of sand by cars and tourists have changed the distribution of loggerhead \n\nnests on Laganas Bay beaches.  \n\nThe economic benefits from tourism can only be sustainable in the long term if appropriate \n\ncontrol measures are taken. On one hand, tourism can result in decreased marine turtle \n\nmortality and in supporting positive population trends if it creates economic incentives for \n\nstakeholder groups to stop overexploitation; and on the other hand, tourism has a large \n\necological footprint because it stimulates air travel, direct use and non-consuming uses of \n\nmarine turtles such as the souvenir market with tortoiseshell.  \n\nTherefore, encouraging tourists not to buy any marine turtle products is another strategy \n\nto prevent illegal use and overexploitation; furthermore, the presence of scientists, tour \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n228 \n\noperators, and tourists on nesting beaches is a deterrent against the illegal taking of  \n\nturtles and eggs (Tro\u00ebng and Drews, 2004). \n\nRegarding this, the Qeshm Geopark authorities hold a workshop for local people of Shib-\n\nderaz village and train some turtle watching tour guides, turtle night guards, turtle day \n\nguards, and some guards to collect turtle eggs in the night and day. These strategies have \n\nnot only preserved the marine turtles but have created some new job opportunities (in the \n\nform of seasonal and part time work) for local communities of Shibderaz village.   \n\nMoreover, officials of geopark with the help of UNDP have established rental rooms and \n\nsouvenir workrooms in this village which offer facilities to tourists together with promoting \n\nlocal economy. \n\n \n\n5.1.6.1.2.   Coral Reef \n\nCoral reefs are vital ecosystems providing a source of income, food, and coastal protec-\n\ntion for millions of people. Coral reefs are composed mainly of reef-building corals:  \n\ncolonial animals that live symbiotically with single-celled microalgae (zooxanthellae) in \n\ntheir body tissue and a calcium carbonate skeleton. Coral reefs are found in warm,  \n\nshallow, clear, low-nutrient tropical and sub-tropical waters, with optimum temperatures of \n\n25-29\u00baC, although they exist in temperature ranges from 18\u00baC (Florida) to 33\u00baC (Persian \n\nGulf) (Grimsditch and Salm, 2006). They are incredibly diverse, covering only 0.2% of the \n\nocean\u2019s floor and they are often dubbed the tropical rainforests of the oceans (Roberts, \n\n2003).  \n\nUnfortunately, coral reefs are also one of the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world. \n\nDisturbances such as bleaching, fishing, pollution, waste, and climate change endanger \n\nthis ecosystem.  \n\nThe Persian Gulf is a semi-enclosed marginal sea surrounded by landmasses and is  \n\nlocated in the subtropical northwest of the Indian Ocean. The Persian Gulf has imposed a \n\nharsh condition on the marine organisms, especially coral reef communities with regard to \n\nsalinity, temperature, and extreme low tides. This is a very shallow sea with an average \n\ndepth of about 35 meters, and was above sea level 10-15 thousand years ago. Present \n\nclimatic conditions force extreme rates of evaporation, which exceed precipitation and \n\nfresh water inputs, thus driving the average salinity above 40 ppt. (Fatemi and Shokri, \n\n2001). In addition, the natural environment of the Persian Gulf is very rich with good fish-\n\ning grounds, extensive coral reefs, and rich pearl oysters, but its ecology has come  \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n229 \n\nincreasingly under pressure from heavy industrialization and in particular, the repeated \n\nmajor petroleum spillages most of which are associated with recent wars such as Iraq and  \n\nKuwait which occurred in the region. Coral reefs are located among Qeshm, Larak, and \n\nHengam Islands. These sites are outside the geopark area, but announced as one of the \n\nsensitive ecological sites.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that goods of coral reefs in general are sub-divided into renewable \n\nresources (fish, seaweed, etc.) and non-renewable goods such as mining of reefs (sand, \n\netc.). The services of coral reefs in general are categorized into: physical structure  \n\nservices, such as coastal protection; biotic services, both within ecosystems (e.g. habitat \n\nmaintenance) and between ecosystems (e.g. biological support through mobile links);  \n\nbio-geo-chemical services, such as nitrogen fixation CO2 / Ca budget control, waste  \n\nassimilation.  \n\nMoreover, sea food products, ornamental fishes, medicines, raw materials (e.g. seaweed), \n\ncurios and jewels, live fish and coral collected for aquarium trade, sand for buildings and \n\nroads, physical structure services, biodiversity and a genetic library together with promot-\n\ning growth of mangroves and sea grass beds and generation of coral sand biotic services \n\nare other economic potentials in this ecosystem (Cesar et al., 2002).   \n\nThe coral reefs of Larak, Hengam, and Qeshm Islands are unique ecosystems for involv-\n\ning locals in conservation projects and recreational activities such as scuba diving and \n\nsnorkelling.  \n\nUnfortunately, reefs are broadly recognized as being limited to warm, shallow, and fully \n\nsaline waters. Even a small amount of pollution brings significant impact on the lives of the \n\nmarine creatures in the Persian Gulf. Corals in the region live in relatively warm tempera-\n\ntures that average up to about 36\u00baC in summer. In addition to pollution from the oil tankers \n\nwhich is considered as the major threat to the region's ecosystem, industrialization, the \n\nbuilding of numerous piers and docks as well as the increase in the water salinity resulting \n\nfrom global warming all inflict serious damage to the existence of the marine life in one of \n\nthe world's unique locations.  \n\nDue to the uncontrolled and hasty urban development and emergence of the urban and \n\nindustrial sewages in the sea especially in the southern parts of the Persian Gulf by the \n\nUnited Arab Emirates and other littoral states, the coral reefs of the region, in particular \n\nthose around the Iran\u2019s Islands like Qeshm, are being silently and gradually suffocated \n\n(Maghsoodloo and Eghtesadi, 2002). \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n230 \n\nClimate change is a natural hazard for coral reefs, and in 1996 and 1998 El-Nino endan-\n\ngered this ecosystem in Persian Gulf and increased coral bleaching (whitening)  \n\n(Wilkinson, 1998).  \n\nMoreover, these days Cochlokinium (harmful alga) decreases the coral reefs in this region \n\n(Ansari nasab, 2009). The last but not the least problem is illegal human activities such as \n\nthievery of coral reefs for the aquarium trade (Zohoori, 2008). But, the coral reefs of \n\nQeshm, Larak, and Hengam are under the protection of geopark and Environmental  \n\nProtection Office of Hormozgan province; so coral thievery and sale is legally forbidden. \n\nThe Marine Environmental Bureau started the study of the vulnerable marine zones of Iran \n\nin 1994 with a project entitled \"A Survey of the Vulnerable Marine Zones of the Persian \n\nGulf and the Oman Sea\". It focused on the study of the mangrove thickets, marshes, coral \n\nreefs, sea turtles and marine mammals, the waterfowl, the mud flats, the sandy beaches, \n\nthe rocky shores, estuaries, and bays and creeks in this area. \n\nIn addition, officials of the geopark encourage locals to participate in conservation  \n\nprojects. In this regard, a pilot project in Salakh village was developed for the rehabilitation \n\nof the natural marine resources through an indigenous method of artificial reefing. This \n\nproject was supported by the United Nations Development Program Regional centre in \n\nIran (UNDP, 2001). \n\nMoreover, coral reefs are among the world\u2019s most spectacular ecosystems, and snorkel-\n\nling and scuba diving are excellent ways to explore them. As coral reefs face an increas-\n\ningly uncertain future, snorkelers and other coral reef visitors can play an important role in \n\nhelping protect these fragile habitats; hence a company with the help of officials of the \n\ngeopark established a scuba diving school in this region.    \n\nRecreational activities can in fact harm coral reefs by breakage of coral skeletons and  \n\ntissue as a result of direct human contact such as walking, touching, or dragging gear; \n\nbreakage of coral skeletons and tissue from boat anchors and also water pollution are \n\nother negative impacts of marine tourism (Kerr et al., 2004). Thus, for sustainable marine \n\ntourism, the manager of the geopark and diving school should observe the following \n\nguidelines in tourism management planning: (Huse and Wilson, 2007).    \n\n\u2022 Recreational scuba diving trips should not be organized in sites prohibited by \n\nnational or local authorities \n\n\u2022 Recreational scuba diving is limited to diving no deeper than 40 meters (130 \n\nfeet)  \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n231 \n\n\u2022 Training, educating, or information sharing on scuba diving services should be \n\nprovided by the diving excursion guide \n\n\u2022 Environmental education should be organized prior to or during guided diving \n\nexcursions \n\n\u2022 Marine recreation providers should employ dive leaders who can communicate \n\nwith at least 80 percent of the clients in their language and have facility in the \n\nlocal language. All staff training and education should be in the local language \n\nused by dive leaders \n\n\u2022 A guided scuba diving group should not exceed 8 divers. All groups must be \n\nunder the overall control of the dive leader who will assign a dive leader assis-\n\ntant to each group. The dive leader accompanies one of the groups. A dive \n\nleader assistant aids the dive leaders in enforcing the safety and environmental \n\npractices \n\n\u2022 A dive leader should oversee all guided scuba diving activities. If the groups \n\nare large, the dive leader should have additional dive leader assistants. Dive \n\nleaders and assistants should share information and provide leadership to  \n\nclients both above and under water by enforcing all provisions of the preferred \n\npractices for environmental behaviour \n\n\u2022 Water entry points from boats, in waters less than 3 meters (9 feet) deep, \n\nshould lie over sand or rubble, not coral, or in water of sufficient depth that  \n\ndivers can make adjustments and become acclimated with minimal impact on \n\ncorals or sea grass beds \n\n\u2022 Coral parks and other conservation projects should be supported \n\n\u2022 Purchasing souvenirs made from coral or other marine life by tourists should \n\nbe avoided \n\n\u2022 Tourists should avoid touching corals; even a slight contact can harm them  \n\n\u2022 Tourists should avoid using gloves and kneepads in coral environments \n\n\u2022 Guides and managers should make sure garbage is well stowed, especially \n\nlight plastic items and cigarette butts \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n232 \n\n  5.1.6.2.  Noteworthy Flora \n\nThe Floristic list of Qeshm Island illustrates that there are 314 species and subspecies of \n\nvascular plants in 202 genera. The Island\u2019s major vegetations are as follows: mangrove \n\nforests, halophyte vegetation, psammophyte-halophyte vegetation, vegetation on the \n\neroding terraces, and arid woodlands (Attar et al., 2004).     \n\nThe first and most important plant community in the Island is mangrove sea forest that \n\ncontains a grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) locally named Harra. The Harra tree, whose \n\nscientific name is attributed to the Iranian physician and philosopher Avicenna, is a small \n\ntree \u2013 from 3 to 6 meters \u2013 with bright green leaves and twigs.  \n\nBesides the mangrove, on the sandy beaches one can see some scattered Acacia and \n\nProsopis, and in the shallow coastal waters red and brown algae (Rhodophyceae and \n\nPhaeophyceae) (Attar et al., 2004). \n\nThe holy fig tree with aerial roots (Ficus Religiosa) is another tourist attraction in the \n\nQeshm Geopark.   \n\n \n\n5.1.6.2.1.  Mangrove Sea Forest \n\nOne of the most unique environments found in nature is the mangrove forest. The  \n\nmangroves forests are the halophyte forests which are distributed alongside the coastal \n\nzone in tropical and subtropical regions. They are the forests that appear homogeneous \n\non the surface, with few land species but enormous aquatic and marine wealth. This eco-\n\nsystem is found at the junction between land and sea. The principal characteristics of \n\nmangrove tree species are their high tolerance to salinity. \n\nBetween Qeshm Island Geopark and a part of the coast of Hormozgan Province, there is \n\nan ecosystem that contains a grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) locally named Harra.  \n\nThe mangrove forest of the Qeshm Geopark was designated on the Raamsar conven-\n\ntion's list of international lagoons in 1975 as well as a Biosphere Reserve in 1976 \n\n(UNESCO, 2008). This natural ecosystem is unique amongst mangrove habitats in West \n\nAsia because of its vast area, and its adaptation to very hot weather and more saline sea \n\nwater (over 40 ppt.).The mangrove zones provide a suitable habitat for invertebrates. The \n\nHarra sea forest is an important breeding site for migratory birds. \n\nAbout the economic potential of the Mangrove Sea forests, this ecosystem performs sev-\n\neral functions, such as absorbing pollutants; they are places for juvenile stages of  \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n233 \n\norganisms to live, soil reclamation forest, forest flood control, and shelter for wildlife.  \n\nMangrove forests are very important for coastal environments and ecosystems, since they \n\ncan protect the coastline from erosion and rises in sea level. There is a high sedimentation \n\nrate in these forests so they can build land. Indeed, mangrove forests serve as a buffer \n\nzones between marine and land ecosystems.  \n\nBeside the ecological aspects, mangrove forest has direct socioeconomic functions such \n\nas fuel harvesting, timber industry, fish catching, paper materials, and pharmacology, and \n\nindirect functions such as aquaculture projects like shrimp farming pools (Hossainipour \n\nKooveei et al., 2005).  \n\nThe sea forest of mangrove of Qeshm Island has great economic potential for fish catch-\n\ning, charcoal production, cattle fodder, and bee-keeping, among others. Nevertheless, this \n\necosystem is endangered and ought to be legally controlled as an economic activity.  \n\nBesides non-renewable resources, the mangrove forests of Qeshm play an important role \n\nin ecotourism and recreational activities. For attracting more tourists to Harra forest, forest \n\nleadership is necessary and the geopark is the key actor to provide some basic infrastruc-\n\nture.  \n\nExperiences in Togean Islands, Indonesia, have shown that the money spent on these \n\ninfrastructures was compensated by the additional income generated by the tourism  \n\nindustry in the area (UNU, 2005). In this regard, the local government of the Qeshm \n\nGeopark tries to develop infrastructures in the geopark. These enterprises promote socio-\n\neconomic activities and well-being of indigenous people with the help of tourism marketing \n\nand conservation methods in the geopark.  \n\nQeshm Island Free Zone Organization and geopark have planned to cruise the tourists \n\naround Harra Sea Forest in local small boats (Farsani et al., 2008). Piers of Tabl and  \n\nSoheili villages were equipped and developed by local administration, receiving passen-\n\ngers and tourists to visit these sites. This project has created some job opportunities for \n\nlocals.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that the mangrove sea forest of Qeshm is endangered. The restoration of \n\nmangrove trees takes a long time. The mangroves take more than 20-30 years to recover \n\nfrom severe oil spill impacts (Hoff et al., 2002). Additional impacts such as hurricanes, \n\nnatural or man-made impacts such as harbour infrastructure and industrial development \n\nlike oil refineries, ports, airfields, and shrimp farming pools damage this ecosystem signifi-\n\ncantly.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n234 \n\nNowadays, the mangrove forest of Qeshm Geopark is threatened. The first problem is the \n\nincrease of building industry of heavy harbour in Khouran region which is a great menace \n\nfor the survival of Harra forest (Yousefi Azar, 2008). In addition, 80% of the Qeshm \n\nGeopark population are rural people and suffer from desertification phenomena in this  \n\nregion. They enter illegally into the Harra protected area in boats, and break the branches \n\nof Avicennia marina for charcoal production and use the leaves of Harra for cattle fodder. \n\nThey are not aware that this leads in desertification (Yousefi Azar, 2008).  \n\nThe shrimp farming pools established in the mangrove, near the Khouran region, are  \n\nanother threat to Harra forest.  \n\nThe last but not the least problem is oil pollution from shipping and oil tankers that threat-\n\nens Khouran Strait mangroves and also diffuses water pollution coming from the nearby \n\ncoastal city of Bandar Abbas (Sebastian Lassen, 2008). \n\nFor the sake of the Harra Sea forest protection, mangroves in Qeshm are under the  \n\nprotection of Environmental Protection Office of Hurmozgan province.  \n\nSince 1992 desertification has threatened the Qeshm Island, thus the Natural Recourses \n\nDepartment of Hurmozgan province has launched a plant propagation of Avicennia  \n\nmarina. Annually many of these species are planted in Harra region especially on 5th \n\nMarch - the day of afforestation in Iranian culture. Regarding this, officials of the geopark, \n\nthrough encouraging locals in plant propagation of Avicennia marina in mangrove Sea  \n\nforest ecosystem, create supplementary income for locals.   \n\nFurthermore, environmental agencies located in the Qeshm Geopark have agreed on  \n\npreventing the establishing of heavy harbours and traffic of heavy ships near the Harra \n\nforest, because these transportation activities have undeniable impacts on this ecosystem \n\n(Hossainipour kooveei et al., 2005).  \n\nIn Harra Sea forest, ecotourism can play a role, as a low risk economic activity, in generat-\n\ning income for the local communities. Hence, officials of the geopark should encourage \n\ntourists and guides to observe sustainable tourism guidelines in this endangered ecosys-\n\ntem.   \n\nFor instance, the boatmen should avoid wake speed; \u201cwake\u201d is a path of disturbed water \n\nleft behind a moving boat; \u201cno wake speed\u201d means there is no \u201cwhite\u201d water in track or \n\npath of the boat or the white water created in waves immediately by the boat and in no \n\ncase greater than 10 kilometres per hour. \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n235 \n\nIn addition, servicing engines to minimize discharge of pollutants into the environment and \n\nmaximize performance and fuel efficiency is an important sustainable strategy. The last \n\nbut not the least solution is environmental education prior to or during recreational boating \n\nactivities directed by guides or boatmen.  \n\n  \n\n5.1.7.  Cultural Heritage and Sites in Qeshm Geopark \n\nQeshm Island in the south of Iran is a very strict traditional region; local people wear tradi-\n\ntional clothes and the local women use henna tattoo designs in marriage ceremonies. The \n\nlocal communities also hold traditional annual festivals such as Nowruz Sayyad Festival; \n\nNowruz in Persian means new day, and typically refers to the Persian New Year Festival, \n\nand Sayyad means fisherman.  \n\nIn Qeshm Island, the sea and fishing play a major role in people\u2019s livelihood. Nowruz Say-\n\nyad Festival is celebrated at the beginning of the main fishing season in late July; one of \n\nthe most extensive celebrations is held in the Salkh village in south of Qeshm Geopark. At \n\nthis time local fishermen stop fishing, because they believe that the fish should have a \n\nchance to reproduce.  \n\nTherefore, everyone goes to the sea to bathe and start the new fishing year. Then, they \n\nwear new clothes and prepare various dishes, which should not contain any fish or  \n\nseafood.  \n\nOther traditions in this festival are the playing of drums by a group of men dressed in \n\nwhite, accompanied by another group singing joyful songs whilst moving in harmony with \n\nthe rhythm of the drums. There are also various contests such as rowing and tug-of-war. \n\nBesides this, two men wear black clothes and play out an interesting theatre (Jadidonline, \n\n2009).  \n\nIt is noteworthy that the Nowruz Festival (the traditional Iranian New Year in the first of \n\nspring) and religious festivals are other ceremonies held in this Island.  \n\nAside from traditional festivals, there are many archaeological heritage sites in Qeshm  \n\nIsland some of which are located in the geopark territory and some others are out of that.  \n\nAs for Qeshm history, since Qeshm has strategic importance, the Portuguese, English, \n\nand Dutch competed for influence in the region (Potts, 2004).      \n\nHence, there are some archaeological heritage sites from them such as English and  \n\nPortuguese cemeteries in Qeshm. Portuguese fortresses in Qeshm and Hormuz Islands, \n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study \n\n236 \n\nwhich were built during domination of Portuguese on Persian Gulf, are another tourist  \n\nattraction in these islands. Recently, Gulbenkian has set up a project for rebuilding castles \n\nin Iran, so they are trying to negotiate with Iranian governors (Lucas Coelho, 2009). \n\nNaderi castle, water reservoirs, pilgrimage sites, and mosques, are other historical sites in \n\nQeshm Geopark territory. Moreover, the Giyahdan village with its wind towers and \n\nmosques is recognized as a historical site for tourists.  \n\nA series of both natural and manmade caves in the heights of a mountain of Qeshm \n\nGeopark, named \u201cKharbas Caves\u201d, is another item of cultural heritage in this territory and \n\nis a symbol of the ancient settlements.   \n\nFurthermore, the architectural facets of the dwellings in the Loft village can be another cul-\n\ntural tourist attraction in this rural area. The main architectural features are the traditional \n\nair vents or ventilators in various sizes (Appendix 29). The buildings or houses in this  \n\nvillage are constructed close together and streets are extremely narrow (Nouroozi et al., \n\n2001). There are 366 well-known wells in the Loft village near the port which are known as \n\nTala. It is noteworthy that the numbers of wells are more or less the symbol of the number \n\nof days in a year (365); in the past the local communities of this village got water from one \n\nwell each day (Appendix 30).  \n\nRegarding cultural sustainability, Qeshm Geopark authorities try not only to organize  \n\nregional festivals and fairs but also, in order to revival local handicrafts, they established \n\ntwo handicrafts workrooms in rural areas. Chapter five, part 2 will explain in more detail \n\nabout the role of the establishment of Qeshm Geopark in cultural sustainability.   \n\n \n\n5.1.8.  Indicators of Sustainable Development for Qeshm Geopark \n\nSustainable development indicators can lead to better decisions and more effective  \n\nactions by simplifying, clarifying, and making aggregated information available to policy \n\nmakers. They can help to incorporate physical and social science knowledge into deci-\n\nsion-making; they can also help to measure and to calibrate progress toward sustainable \n\ndevelopment goals. Sustainable development indicators can provide an early warning to \n\nprevent economic, social, and environmental setbacks. These indicators are important for \n\nimplementation tourism management planning.  \n\nIn this study, we used the third edition of the Commission on Sustainable Development \n\n(CSD) indicators table. The newly revised CSD indicators contain a core set of 50 indica-\n\n\n\nChapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  \n\n237 \n\ntors (United Nations, 2007). These core indicators are part of a larger set of 96 indicators \n\nof sustainable development. \n\nSome of indicators were not easily available for the Qeshm Geopark; therefore, we  \n\nselected the indicators which were related to tourism and the geopark. Consequently, we \n\nselected 25 indicators focusing on social, environmental, and economical indexes (Table \n\n5.1.1). \n\nTable 5.1.1- CSD Indicators related to tourism and geopark in Qeshm Geopark \n\nTheme Sub-theme Core indicator Other indicator Qeshm Geopark indicator \n\nPoverty \n\n \n \n\nIncome  \npoverty \n\nProportion of \n\npopulation living \n\nbelow national \n\npoverty line \n\nProportion of  \n\npopulation below \n\n$1 a day \n\n0.6 % of rural population are \n\nbelow international poverty line \n\n( $1 a day per person) (2005)  \n\n( Asr Iran, 2009) \n\n \n\n11% of rural population in Iran \n\nare below national poverty line \n\n(2005) (Asr Iran, 2009) \n\nSanitation \n\nProportion of \n\npopulation using \n\nan \n\n improved  \n\nsanitation facility \n\n \n\n___ \n\nThere is no sewerage system in \n\nthe villages located around the \n\nQeshm Geopark; they use ab-\n\nsorbing wells \n\nDrinking water \n\nProportion of \n\npopulation using \n\nan  \n\nimproved water \n\nsource \n\n___ \n\nThere are no water public stand \n\npipes or piped connections to \n\nhouses of villages around the \n\ngeopark; locals should buy wa-\n\nter from Qeshm city.

Summary and Conclusions \n\nBearing in mind that in the previous chapter geoparks were classified into six categories, \n\ntherefore, in view of the fact that salt diapirs and salt caves, which are rare and unique \n\nphenomena in the world, had a high degree of importance in creation of Qeshm Geopark \n\nand development of geotourism in this region, Qeshm Geopark, can be classified in group \n\nE (cave or karst tourism).  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the longest salt cave in the world is located in Qeshm Geopark \n\nterritory but the results of field trips around the geopark and SWOT matrices as a  \n\ncomparison model indicate that there are not enough tourist facilities in 3 Namakdan Salt \n\nCave.   \n\nFurthermore, the results of the Sustainable Development (CSD) indicators table illustrate \n\nthat Qeshm Geopark is a sensitive environmental ecosystem with critically endangered \n\nspecies; moreover, natural hazards such as earthquake, drought, and Red Tide threaten \n\nthis area.   \n\nApart from environmental indicators, water supply and unemployment are social problems \n\nin the villages located in surrounding of the Qeshm Geopark.  It is worth mentioning that \n\nthere is enough bottled water for tourists and visitors in hotels, restaurants and supermar-\n\nkets.  \n\nBesides, the statistical references indicate that crime rate is low in this area and Qeshm \n\nGeopark is a safe tourism destination.  \n\nIn addition, the SWOT matrices make it clear that there are some weaknesses and threats \n\nthat affect the geopark. In 2010, UNESCO issued a Yellow card for Qeshm Geopark; the \n\nmanagement plan of the Qeshm Geopark was recently submitted to UNESCO and when \n\nthe plan is implemented some weaknesses tend to be overcome. The suggestions which \n\nare illustrated in the opportunities section of SWOT matrices can be supportive strategies \n\nfor a better management of Qeshm Geopark.  \n\nThe next part will focus on findings and results of questionnaires at local level. Since the \n\ntopic is new and the geopark activities haven't been thoroughly studied yet, results of  \n\nanalysing questionnaires from geoparks around the world and the local communities of \n\nQeshm Geopark can not only discover innovative strategies in geoparks but also can \n\nevaluate the role of geoparks in rural development.   \n\n    \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5- Sustainable Tourism in \nQeshm Geopark (Iran)  \n\n \nPart 2- Findings of the Empirical Study at \n\nLocal Level (Case Study) \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    249 \n\n5.2.1.  Profile of the Qeshm Geopark  \n\n5.2.1.1.  Introduction \n\nIn this study, Qeshm Geopark, which is located in the south of Iran, in the Persian Gulf, \n\nwas selected as the case study. As mentioned in Chapter 5 part 1, UNESCO has issued a \n\nyellow card for Qeshm Geopark in 2010; therefore, this geopark has limited time to \n\nchange the future of the geopark. If the geopark authorities can succeed in solving Qeshm \n\nGeopark\u2019s weakness problems, the geopark will stay as a GGN member.  \n\nThe aim of this section is to identify policies and new strategies (innovation) pursued by \n\nthe local government of Qeshm Geopark in achieving the goals of local development.  \n\nRegarding this, two specific objectives were designed as follow:  \n\n\u2022 To engage local communities in geotourism and geopark activities \n\n\u2022 To evaluate the role played by tourism in achieving better quality of life for local \n\npopulations and stimulating economic growth \n\nData for this part of study were obtained from a questionnaire which was designed for the \n\nlocal communities of Qeshm Geopark (19 villages). Interviews in face-to-face format were \n\nconducted from July to August 2009. 720 (8% of population) questionnaire forms were  \n\ncollected after they had been filled in by the chosen respondents (local people) living in 19 \n\nsurrounding villages of Qeshm Geopark. Data were analysed using the SPSS software \n\nand profiled by frequencies, Pearson Chi-Square test, Mean-One Sample T test, and  \n\nIndependent Samples Test.  \n\nThis chapter starts with sociocultural impacts of tourism in Qeshm Geopark, followed by  \n\nsocioeconomic impacts of the creation of Qeshm Geopark, socio-environmental impacts \n\nof Qeshm Geopark in rural areas, educational activities in this territory, and ends with  \n\ninnovative activities in Qeshm Geopark and a conclusion.  \n\n \n\n5.2.1.2.  Socio-Demographic Characteristics of the Local Communities \n\nQuestionnaires were administered in nineteen villages located in the Qeshm Geopark  \n\nterritory. As shown in Table 5.2.1, the majority of responses were obtained in Tabl village \n\n(18.1%), many were also collected in other villages (like Giyahdan (13.5 %), Shibderaz, \n\nand Salakh (both 8.2%), Sar Rig (7.9 %) and Berke Khalaf (7.6%).   \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n250 \n\nTable 5.2.1 - Villages located in the Qeshm Geopark territory where the questionnaire was  \n\nadministered \n\n \nNo Village Frequency Percent \n\n1 Berke Khalaf 55 7.6 \n\n2 Chahu Gharbi 17 2.4 \n\n3 Chahu Sharghi 40 5.6 \n\n4 Darkooh 17 2.4 \n\n5 Doorbani 20 2.8 \n\n6 Dulab 43 6.0 \n\n7 Gambran 17 2.4 \n\n8 Giyahdan 97 13.5 \n\n9 Guran 47 6.5 \n\n10 Guri 19 2.6 \n\n11 Kani 10 1.4 \n\n12 Konar Siah 11 1.5 \n\n13 Maleki 7 1.0 \n\n14 Moradi 10 1.4 \n\n15 Salakh 59 8.2 \n\n16 Sar Rig 57 7.9 \n\n17 Shibderaz 59 8.2 \n\n18 Tabl 130 18.1 \n\n19 Tomgas 5 .7 \n\nTotal - 720 100.0 \n\n \nThe majority of the respondents were male (56.5%) (Table 5.2.2).

Our results also illustrated that unemployment is a  \n\nsocioeconomic problem in the local communities of the surrounding villages of the Qeshm \n\nGeopark. It is worth mentioning that the unemployment rate of females (n= 112) in rural \n\nareas of the geopark territory is much higher than the males.   \n\n \n\n5.2.1. 3.  Sociocultural Impacts of Tourism in the Qeshm Geopark \n\nNowadays, the urbanization rate has increased and in urban communities, traditional  \n\npatterns are not efficient within this lifestyle. In Iran, as in other countries, urbanization has \n\nincreased, while Qeshm Island is one of the Iranian societies where its traditional culture \n\nand lifestyle are interweaved and it was a key component for UNESCO to establish the \n\nfirst Iranian and Middle East Geopark in this Island.   \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n252 \n\nZamani-Farahani and Henderson (2010) noted that in societies such as Iran and Saudi \n\nArabia where religion and politics are interweaved; development of tourism is not the \n\nsame as other countries. In these countries Islam is all pervasive in societies and Sharia \n\nlaw may govern much of what is considered acceptable (Halal) regarding leisure. Laws \n\nprohibit public displays of affection, shaking hands or any physical contact between  \n\nmembers of the opposite sex, unmarried couples sharing rooms, gambling, breaking fast \n\nin daylight during Ramadan, consumption of pork and other forbidden food, selling or \n\ndrinking liquor and dressing inappropriately. Both sexes must cover their torso and upper \n\nlegs at all times and only women\u2019s faces may be exposed (Deng et al., 1994). Frequenting  \n\ndiscotheques and bars and miscellaneous other entertainments are deemed unlawful. \n\nMen and women may be segregated at events and sites such as pools and beach.  \n\nIt seems that a state religion can be a serious barrier for the development of tourism  \n\nmarketing, but the verses of the Quran cited below from the chapters named in brackets  \n\nendorse travelling with a view to achieving spiritual, physical and social goals. Al-Imran \n\n(The Amramites): 137; Al-An\u2019am (Livestock): 11; Al-Nahl (The Bee): 36; Al-Naml (The \n\nAnt): 69; Al-\u2019Ankaboot (The Spider): 20; Al-Room (The Romans): 42/9; Saba\u2019 (Sheba): 18; \n\nYousuf (Joseph): 109; Al-Hajj (The Pilgrimage): 46; Faater (Initiator): 44; Ghafer (For-\n\ngiver): 82/21; Muhammad: 10; Younus (Jonah): 22; and Al-Mulk (Kingship): 15\u2019 (Pickthall, \n\n1976; Yusuf Ali, 2005). The lessons are that more complete submission to God is possible \n\nthrough seeing the beauty and bounty of His creation. Travel can enhance health and well \n\nbeing, reducing stress and enabling Muslims to know God better (Zamani-Farahani and \n\nHenderson, 2010). Moreover, Hajj to Mecca is one of the principles of Islam, requiring \n\nMuslims to make the journey at least once in their lifetime unless prevented by physical \n\nincapacity (Rowley, 1997).  \n\nTo have sustainable tourism development in Iran, it is crucial that the local socio-political \n\nand cultural context is never underestimated. Iran as a Muslim country has strict codes of \n\nsocial contact and some traditional and religious prohibitions that should be respected \n\n(Faghri, 2008).  \n\nTo this end, tourists should be informed about local customs, acceptable social behav-\n\niours, etc. by means of advertisement. Visitors can be educated through introducing local \n\ncultural values, providing cultural guidelines, and presenting briefings about appropriate \n\nbehaviour.   \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    253 \n\nMoreover, in Iran there are many local accents, local dialects and languages (Persian, \n\nTurkey, Kurdish, Armenian, and Arabic etc.) and the people who live in those territories \n\nhave particular traditional clothes and folk music.  \n\nThus, for development of tourism marketing in Iran not only the international tourists \n\nshould not violate to the host customs but also the domestic tourists should respect tradi-\n\ntional culture. Since, geotourism can be the best practice tourism that sustains, or even \n\nenhances, the geographical character of a place, such as its culture, environment,  \n\nheritage, and the well-being of its residents and owing to religious and cultural barriers, \n\nIran should pay particular attention to the development and promotion of geotourism as a \n\nbranch of sustainable tourism in its tourism strategy.  \n\nThis section emphasises the role of the establishment of the Qeshm Geopark on the \n\nminimization of the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in rural areas. Accordingly, \n\nthe following hypothesis was built to examine this role of the Qeshm Geopark.  \n\n\u2022 H8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of  \n\ntourism perceived by local communities  \n\no sub-hypothesis: Men more than the women, who live in the surrounding  \n\nvillages of the Qeshm Geopark, think that tourism has a negative social  \n\nimpact on their community \n\n \n\nA brief description of cultural components in the surrounding villages of the Qeshm \n\nGeopark helps us to gain a better understanding of local customs and traditions in this  \n\nterritory. The official language in Qeshm is Persian but the local people speak the Pahlavi \n\ndialect, as a branch of the primary Persian language. Qeshm is a free trade Island and its \n\neconomy is heavily dependent on trade and such economic activities between local  \n\ncommunities of the island, Arabic countries and India are aided by the local people of \n\nQeshm learning Arabic and Indian languages.   \n\nThe majority of people who live in Qeshm are Muslims but they are Sunni, so they are \n\nclassified as a religious minority in Iran. Very few Christians and Zoroastrians live in this \n\narea as well.  \n\nQeshm Island is a very strict traditional region; local people wear traditional clothes and \n\nthe local women use henna tattoo designs in marriage celebrations. Traditional clothing is \n\na tourist attraction in this Island; the women of Qeshm wear beautiful and colourful tradi-\n\ntional clothes. When they venture out into public, they use a special cover, which is called \n\n\u201cBourke\u201d, designed in different sizes. Some are big and wide enough to cover the whole \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n254 \n\nface and have only two holes over the eyes. Others are narrow and they only cover part of \n\nthe eyes and eyebrows. In addition, ladies cover their heads with a thin cloth, called \n\n\u201cJelopol\u201d, on which they wear a chador or veil. Their blouses are also special. Trousers \n\nare interesting as well; they are made of thick cloth. The upper parts of the pants are loose \n\nand the bottom part is tight.  \n\nThe men, like other southern parts of the country, wear a long, white or colourful shirt,  \n\nlocally called \u201cJimeh\u201d. The long shirt covers them from shoulder to ankle. They are free to \n\nlet you move around and it is suitable for the southern parts because the weather in the \n\nsouth of Iran is warm and humid. Some people wear a hat with holes in it called \u201cAragh-\n\nchin\u201d. \n\nThe local ladies of Qeshm cook a variety of food with fish, shrimp, crab, oyster, meat, \n\ndates, flour, oil, sugar, cereal, and rice. We can name fish kebab, Kolomba, Zebon, \n\nMoflak, Haware, Ankas, Dishow, Poodane, Motabak, Katog-hala, Malook, Palshk,  \n\nMatoota, Momaga, and Singow as local food on the island.  \n\nThe above mentioned factors indicate which people are compatible with local customs in \n\nthis territory; therefore, for developing tourism, officials should pay particular attention to \n\nsociocultural impacts of tourism on the local community. \n\nIn this regard, a questionnaire was designed for the purpose of achieving the research  \n\nobjectives. The questions in the questionnaire were chosen according to the main criteria \n\nthat should be considered when one tries to measure the impact of the development of \n\ntourism and its effect on the standard of living of local people as it is extracted from tour-\n\nism studies and leisure literature. There were 720 questionnaire forms that were recol-\n\nlected after they had been filled in by the chosen respondents in the Qeshm Geopark. \n\nDescriptive statistic analysis was used to measure the sociocultural impact of the devel-\n\nopment of tourism on the local community of the geopark. \n\nBased on the results, local people have positive attitudes towards the development of \n\ntourism in the geopark, and 91.9% of respondents were open to accepting an expansion \n\nof tourist marketing in their area. But they (54.9%) believe that there are some negative \n\nsociocultural impacts of the development of tourism on local communities in Qeshm \n\nGeopark (Table 5.2.3).

These results indicate that the majority of men (62.9%), more than women, who \n\nlive in the surrounding villages of the Qeshm Geopark, think that tourism has a negative \n\nimpact on their community (Table 5.2.4, 5.2.5). \n\nAside from the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in this area, locals of the geopark \n\nintroduced some positive socioeconomic impacts of tourism which appeared through \n\ngeopark activities in this area such as local festivals, seafood festivals, supplementary in-\n\ncome, cultural exchange, establishing two handicraft workrooms for women (needlework), \n\nseasonal and part time job opportunities and entrepreneurship, especially for women.   \n\nAccording to the field observation around the rural areas of Qeshm Geopark, plus results \n\nfrom questionnaires filled by officials and interviews with the manager of the geopark, \n\nthere are strategies which Qeshm Geopark, under the supervision of Qeshm Island Free \n\nZone organization with the help of UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) office \n\nin Tehran, Avaye Tabiat Company and Environment Department, have applied for cultural \n\nsustainability: establishing the Geopark museums, which include a collection of local \n\nclothes, artefacts and local musical instruments; publishing books about architecture  of \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n256 \n\nQeshm (especially Laft village), and some photograph albums about local culture \n\nin  Qeshm; organizing workshops to design henna tattoos for tourists in villages of Qeshm \n\nGeopark; holding summer festivals and regional festivals (such as Nowruz Sayyad and \n\nsea food as explained in chapter 5 part 1); and participation of local women in National \n\nand International handicrafts exhibitions and fairs.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that designing a geopark calendar for events of Qeshm Geopark by \n\nthe author of this thesis was another strategy for the preservation of cultural components \n\nin this territory (Appendix 41).  \n\nConsequently, the establishment of Qeshm Geopark can be a gateway for cultural  \n\nsustainability in rural areas of Qeshm Geopark.  \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.4 - Descriptive analysis (Crosstabs) of negative sociocultural impacts of  \n\ndevelopment of tourism variables in Qeshm Geopark  \n\n \n\n  \n   \n\nNegative sociocultural impacts on local \n\ncommunity Total \n\n     Yes No I do not know \n\nSex \n\n Female \n\nCount 139 140 34 313 \n\nExpected Count 171.7 116.9 24.3 313.0 \n\n% within Sex 44.4% 44.7% 10.9% 100.0% \n\n% of Total 19.3% 19.4% 4.7% 43.5% \n\nAdjusted Residual -4.9 3.6 2.7  \n\n Male \n\nCount 256 129 22 407 \n\nExpected Count 223.3 152.1 31.7 407.0 \n\n% within Sex 62.9% 31.7% 5.4% 100.0% \n\n% of Total 35.6% 17.9% 3.1% 56.5% \n\nAdjusted Residual 4.9 -3.6 -2.7  \n\nTotal  \n\nCount 395 269 56 720 \n\nExpected Count 395.0 269.0 56.0 720.0 \n\n% within Sex 54.9% 37.4% 7.8% 100.0% \n\n% of Total 54.9% 37.4% 7.8% 100.0% \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    257 \n\nTable 5.2.5 -Chi- Square test of negative sociocultural impacts of development of tourism  \n\nvariables in Qeshm Geopark  \n\n \n\nChi-Square Tests \n\n Value Df Asymp.

Socioeconomic Impacts of the Establishment of Qeshm Geopark \n\nThe purpose of this section is to investigate the effects of the establishment of Qeshm \n\nGeopark on development of the local economy through geotourism and involvement of \n\nlocal communities in geopark activities. This part also presents a summary of work being \n\ncarried out in Qeshm Geopark for entrepreneurship, creation of new supplementary  \n\nincome and job opportunities in rural areas.   \n\nRegarding this, the following hypotheses were built and tested:   \n\n\u2022 H3: Geotourism activities in geoparks create opportunities for local development  \n\n\u2022 H4: Using geotourism can be a useful strategy for developing tourism in geoparks \n\n\u2022 H7: Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employ-\n\nment of local communities in rural areas and geopark territories \n\n H Null= Salary of local communities involved in geopark activities is equiva-\n\nlent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate (per month):  M1=207 \u20ac (2009) \n\n First sub-hypothesis for H7: Salary of local communities involved in \ngeopark activities is not equivalent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate \n\n(per month):  M1?207 \u20ac (2009) \n\n H Null= Men and women earn equal revenue from geopark activities:   \n\nM Men = M Women \n\n Second sub-hypothesis for H7: Men earn more revenue from geopark \nactivities: M Men ? M Women   \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n258 \n\nResults of statistical analyses of questionnaires are shown in Table 5.2.6.; Results  \n\nindicate that unemployment is a socioeconomic problem in the surrounding villages of \n\nQeshm Geopark. As Qeshm is a free trade Island and is located in Persian Gulf, the local \n\neconomy of this area is heavily dependent on fishery and business activity. Therefore, \n\nmany passengers with a view to trade travel to this island annually. It is evident that,  \n\nbecause of the climate limitations tourists prefer to travel to Qeshm from October to April. \n\nThus, seasonal unemployment and mass tourism are consequences of the climatic condi-\n\ntions on this Island.    \n\nThe majority (82.8%) of responders (local communities living in the surrounding villages of \n\nQeshm Geopark) believe that geotourism has a positive impact on the local economy and \n\n91.9% of them desire to see an expansion of tourism marketing in Qeshm Geopark. Thus, \n\nmost respondents welcomed the Qeshm Geopark concept and were happy to be part of \n\nthe geopark. \n\nSince 2001, officials of the environment department and Qeshm Island free zone organi-\n\nzation with the help of UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) have tried to  \n\ninvolve local communities in conservation activities and tourism marketing. This strategy \n\nhas not only reduced unemployment and provided supplementary income for locals but \n\nhas also helped the local government impart indigenous knowledge.  \n\nBeside this, Qeshm free zone organization, with the purpose of sustainable development, \n\nhas proceeded to identify, register, and maintain the natural, geological, historical, and \n\ncultural heritage on Qeshm Island. Finally, Qeshm Geopark was registered in the United \n\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2006; establishing \n\nQeshm Geopark was expedient in attracting tourists to this area.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    259 \n\nTable 5.2.6 - Frequency distribution of questions related to economy in Qeshm Geopark \n\nQuestions Frequency Percent \nCumulative \n\nPercent \n\nlocal community depends on a single industry \n\n1.

However, the \n\nmajority (50.6%) of responders recognize the geopark as an opportunity for socioeco-\n\nnomic development in their area, particularly those involved in tourism-based activities, i.e. \n\nboatmen, family guest houses owners, tour guides and souvenir shop owners.  \n\nSamples illustrate that Qeshm Geopark only benefits locals in 5 villages among 19  \n\nvillages located in the geopark territory. Qeshm Geopark authorities attempt to create new \n\njob opportunities and up to now they have succeeded in providing some seasonal and \n\npart-time jobs for the local people of these villages (Berke khalaf, Shibderaz, Tabl, Salakh, \n\nand Chahu Sharghi) (Figure 5.2.1).    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.1- Development of local economy in 5 villages of Qeshm Geopark,  \n\n(Farsani et al., 2011c)  \n\n \n\nShibderaz with 38% (Table 5.2.7) of locals involved in tourism and conservation activities \n\nis a pioneer in local development. Managing family guest houses, organizing tour leaders \n\nfor wildlife watching (especially marine turtles), providing turtle watching tours, acting as \n\nguards, and selling souvenirs are job opportunities and jobs associated with tourism which \n\nappeared through creation of the geopark and development of geotourism in this village.  \n\nMoreover, in spring which is the season of nesting and laying eggs of Hawksbill Turtles \n\nlocals of Shibderaz cooperate in collecting and protecting eggs and finally, they return the \n\nbaby turtles to their natural habitat into the Persian Gulf. Meanwhile, this conservation  \n\nBerke Khalaf \n\nShibderaz \nSalakh \n\nTabl \n\nChahu Sharghi \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    261 \n\nactivity not only preserves the marine turtles, but also provides supplementary income and \n\nseasonal jobs for local people of the Shibderaz.  \n\nCreating part time jobs for women is another geopark enterprise in Shibderaz and Berke \n\nkhalaf village. Geopark officials with the help of UNDP/SGP established two handicraft \n\nworkrooms (needlework) in these villages but the local women of Shibderaz requested the \n\nestablishment of a fixed souvenir shop in the village.  \n\nOrganizing mangrove tours around the mangrove sea forest in small boats in Tabl village \n\nand establishing a family guest house in this village are other geopark enterprises. The \n\nstatistical analyses of samples indicate that these activities create 5% of job opportunities \n\nin this site of Qeshm Geopark (Table 5.2.7).  \n\nIn addition, holding regional festivals and seafood festivals in rural areas such as Salakh \n\nvillage is another strategy to attract tourists to these rural areas.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that working as guards for geological sites and guides in the \n\ngeopark museum are other full time jobs which directly emerge through geopark activities. \n\nAside from direct job opportunities, geopark and geotourism development embrace  \n\nindirect activities associated with tourism such as accommodation, local transportation, \n\nlocal restaurants, and services.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n262 \n\nTable 5.2.7- Percentage of local people who are involved in Qeshm Geopark activities \n\nNo Village  \n\nAre you employed in the geopark or involved in geopark  \nactivities? \n\nYes No \n\n1 Berke khalaf 9% 91% \n\n2 Chahu Gharbi - - \n\n3 Chahu Sharghi 3% 97% \n\n4 Darkuh - - \n\n5 Dulab - - \n\n6 Durbani - - \n\n7 Gambran - - \n\n8 Guran - - \n\n9 Guri - - \n\n10 Gyiahdan - - \n\n11 Kani - - \n\n12 Konar siyah - - \n\n13 Maleki - - \n\n14 Moradi - - \n\n15 Salakh 2% 98% \n\n16 Sar Rig - - \n\n17 Shibderaz 38% 62% \n\n18 Tabl 5% 95% \n\n19 Tomgas - - \n\n \n\nQuestion number thirteen (Q13: How much is your salary from involvement in geopark  \n\nactivities? - Per month) was designed to test the following sub- hypothesis.  \n\n H Null= Salary of local communities involved in geopark activities is  \n\nequivalent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate (per month):  M1=207 \u20ac \n\n(2009) \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    263 \n\n First sub-hypothesis for H7: Salary of local communities involved in \ngeopark activities is not equivalent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate \n\n(per month):  M1?207 \u20ac (2009) \n\n228 respondents replied to this question (Table 5.2.8). Since the government determined \n\nNational Minimum Wage rate in rural areas as equivalent to 207 \u20ac per month in 2009, the \n\ntest value is therefore 207 \u20ac. The data was analysed using a one-sample t-test which \n\ncompares the mean score of a sample to a known value.  \n\nBased on the result of the test, the monthly revenue of local communities involved in \n\nQeshm Geopark activities is less than  207 \u20ac  (Table 5.2.9) Thus, it can be said that the \n\nnull hypothesis is rejected and the first sub-hypothesis is confirmed.   \n \n\nTable 5.2.8 - Descriptive analyses related to Q13  \n\n(If you are employed in the geopark, how much is your salary?) \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMonthly Revenue Frequency Percent \n\n 50-100 62 8.6 \n\n100-150 108 15.0 \n\n150-200 21 2.9 \n\n200-250 36 5.0 \n\nvolunteer 1 .1 \n\nTotal 228 31.7 \n\nMissing System 492 68.3 \n\nTotal 720 100.0 \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n264 \n\nTable 5.2.9 - Results of One-Sample T-Test analysis for question 13 \n\n (If you are employed in the geopark, how much is your salary?) \n\n \n\nOne-Sample Statistics \n\nN Mean Std.

We draw \n\nattention to the fact that the majority of local communities are involved in geopark activities \n\nin the form of seasonal (n=127 persons) or part-time (n= 86 persons) work.  \n\nAccording to field trip observation around Qeshm Geopark, some local women in rural ar-\n\neas of Qeshm Geopark are engaged in handicraft workrooms, room rentals, and activities \n\nsuch as designing henna tattoos for visitors, and doing aquaculture of pearls, while the \n\nlocal men are employed as boatman around the Harra sea forest, marine turtle watching \n\nguides, marine turtle guards, geosite surveillance, etc.  \n\nThe independent samples t-test (Table 5.2.10) was used to test the second  \n\nsub-hypothesis of the seventh hypothesis.  \n\n H Null= Men and women earn equal revenue from the geopark activities:   \n\nM Men = M Women (2009) \n\n Second sub-hypothesis for H7: Men earn more revenue from geopark \nactivities: M Men ?

Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and the results of the inde-\n\npendent samples t- test can help to confirm the second sub- hypothesis.  \n\nConsequently, authorities of Qeshm Geopark try to encourage local communities to  \n\nparticipate in geopark activities, particularly conservation activities and tourism in the form \n\nof geotourism and ecotourism. Involving local in these kinds of activities can create some \n\njob opportunities for them. But results illustrated that the majority of these job opportunities \n\nare in the form of part-time and seasonal work. Thus, it can be said that the establishment \n\nof Qeshm Geopark can help to create supplementary income for locals who live in rural \n\nareas of Qeshm Geopark. However, Qeshm Geopark is an early stage of its activity and \n\nthey concentrate only on 5 villages among 19 villages located in the geopark territory. It is \n\nworth mentioning that some villages such as Shibderaz village and Berke khalaf village \n\nwhich are active in development of geotourism, are known as geopark sites but are  \n\nlocated outside the Qeshm Geopark border and we suggest that for submitting a new  \n\napplication dossier to UNESCO, authorities should change the border of the geopark  \n\nterritory.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n266 \n\nTable 5.2.10 - the results of applying Independent Samples T-Test for question 13 \n\n(If you are employed in the geopark, how much is your salary?) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIndependent Samples Test \n\n Levene's Test for Equality of \nVariances t-test for Equality of Means \n\n \n  \n\n95% Confidence Interval of \n\nthe Difference \n\n \nF Sig. t df Sig.

Socio-Environmental Impacts of the Establishment of Qeshm Geopark  \n\nAs mentioned in the literature review chapter, conservation of geological and natural  \n\nheritage is one of the triple targets of the establishment of geosites and geoparks.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this section is to identify the effect of the establishment of Qeshm \n\nGeopark on preservation of natural resources and landscapes. Regarding this I present a \n\nsummary of work being carried out in geopark territory. We also designed three questions \n\nin order to test the following hypotheses:  \n\n\u2022 H1: Geoparks involve local communities in conservation activities \n\n\u2022 H2: Geoparks have positive socio-environmental impacts on local communities   \n\nThe development of tourism marketing may have a negative impact on the local environ-\n\nment and landscape of rural areas located in Qeshm Geopark territory. As illustrated in \n\nTable 5.2.11, the first question investigates whether the local community believe that tour-\n\nism marketing has a negative impact on their environment or not. The second question \n\ninquires which local organisation or community encourages local communities to protect \n\nnatural (geo and bio) heritage. In addition, the third question evaluates the environmental \n\nbenefits resulting from the establishment of Qeshm Geopark in rural areas. The samples \n\n(720 questionnaires) were analysed by the descriptive analysis method via SPSS tool.   \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.11- Descriptive analysis of questions related to socio-environmental negative impact \n\nof development of tourism in Qeshm Geopark \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nQuestion \nYes No \n\nI do not \nknow \n\nPercent \n\ntourism has a negative impact on the local \n\nenvironment \n51.0 38.5 10.6 \n\nthere is a community-based approach to conservation \n\nbeing applied to your area to encourage protection of \n\nthe natural area \n\n55.0 19.2 25.8 \n\nThere are some environmental benefits resulting from \n\na geopark in your area \n54.4 13.3 32.2 \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n268 \n\nResults illustrate that the majority of local people (51%) believe that tourism has a nega-\n\ntive impacts on their local environment. Respondents mentioned the following negative  \n\nimpacts affected the Qeshm Geopark though development of tourism:  \n\n\u2022 Producing solid waste in coastal areas \n\n\u2022 A negative impact on the landscape especially in Spring (tourism season picks up) \n\nsuch as camping  \n\n\u2022 Producing noise pollution \n\n\u2022 Moving lights (torch lights and other illumination used by tourists) scares nesting \n\nturtles  \n\n\u2022 Breaking off stalactites by tourists as souvenirs in Namakdan Salt Caves \n\n\u2022 Writing mementos on the stones of Chahkooh site  \n\n\u2022 Reducing fresh water  \n\n\u2022 Using camera flash by tourists in turtle sites (flash photography of nesting turtles is \n\nillegal in some places)  \n\nIt is noteworthy that the majority of respondents (54.4%) introduced some environmental \n\nbenefits in their territory that appeared through establishment of Qeshm Geopark. For  \n\ninstance, installing rubbish-bins and signposts in villages, involving locals in conservation \n\nactivities and tourism marketing (local guardians for preserving turtles, collecting rubbish \n\nin coastal areas, local tour guides for turtle watching and plant propagation) are enter-\n\nprises which not only create  seasonal job opportunities and supplementary income for \n\nindigenous people but also preserve the landscape and environment.   \n\nConsequently, it is evident that the establishment of Qeshm Geopark can help to minimize \n\nthe negative environmental impacts. And also the results can help to confirm the first and \n\nthe second hypotheses.   \n\nAccording to responses and field trip observations, the Qeshm free zone organization, the \n\nenvironment department, the office of tourism deputy, geopark, the UNDP office in  \n\nTehran, NGOs, and private sectors such as the Avaye Tabiat Company try to involve local \n\ncommunities in geopark conservation activities. But results indicate that significant num-\n\nbers (45%) of locals have no information about the above mentioned activities such as the \n\nnew terms of \u2018geopark\u2019 and \u2018geotourism\u2019; a lack of comprehensive educational programs \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    269 \n\nhas also made the local people of Qeshm Geopark unaware of geopark activities and its \n\ntargets.  \n\nThereby, education as a geopark target plays an important role in awareness of locals. In \n\nthe next section I concentrate on educational activities in the Qeshm Geopark.  \n\n \n\n5.2.1.6.  Educational Activities in Qeshm Geopark \n\nExisting geoparks organize a whole spectrum of educational activities for both visitors and \n\nlocal adults and schoolchildren. This section discusses the educational activities in the \n\nQeshm Geopark, and also tries to test the following hypothesis:  \n\n\u2022 H7: Geoparks contribute to increasing the geological knowledge and employment \n\nof local communities in rural areas and geopark territories \n\nThe purpose of this section is to explore local community understanding of Qeshm \n\nGeopark and its meaning to their everyday lives. 67% of respondents said they had no \n\nunderstanding of the geopark concept and its activities (Figure 5.2.2). These local respon-\n\ndents could not relate the geopark concept to their everyday lives. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.2: Percentage of respondents to the question  \n\n(Do you know what a geopark is?) \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n270 \n\nBased on the results of analyses, the majority (75%) of the local respondents know that \n\nQeshm is a geopark (Figure 5.2.3). But when asked what first came to their mind about \n\nthe meaning of geopark, most of the respondents answered \u2018rocks and rock formations\u2019. \n\nWhen asked to identify where the Qeshm Geopark is, most of them identified the valley of \n\nStars \u2013 located near the Berkeh khalaf village \u2013 placed on the face of the rock landscape.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.3 - Percentage of respondents to the question \n\n(Do you know that Qeshm is a geopark?) \n\n \n\nThe results of questionnaires and literature indicate that the Qeshm Geopark (Iran) is the \n\nonly geopark which has a weak operation on educational programs for local schoolchil-\n\ndren and local communities. Qeshm has centred all its educational activities on geopark \n\nmuseums and publications.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that recently authorities of Qeshm Geopark organized some meet-\n\nings about cooperation between Qeshm Global Geopark and schools of Shahab region \n\nlocated in the geopark territory. Furthermore, they organized field trips and a festival titled \n\n\u201cSchool Bell Ringing for Geopark\u201d for schoolchildren.  \n\nRegarding educational activity, Qeshm Geopark Museum opened in 2005. The purpose of \n\nthe museum and archives is to collect, preserve, make available for research, and exhibit \n\ndocuments and artefacts that will serve to illustrate the local history and culture. This  \n\nincludes a collection of taxidermy of native and migratory birds, creepers, mammals, \n\nfishes, and insects of Qeshm Geopark. Also fossils of corals and bivalves of the geopark \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    271 \n\nare exhibited in the museum.  Unfortunately, the Geopark Museum is located outside the \n\nborder of the geopark.   \n\nIn addition, interpretation packages are available for visitors, tourists, and researchers \n\nsuch as the geotourism Atlas of Qeshm, Birds Atlas of Qeshm, handbook of Harra  \n\ncommunity, map of Qeshm, and Qeshm geology books.  \n\nMoreover, toys based on geopark elements such as a turtle puzzle (the symbol of  \n\nShibderaz village), allocating parts of geopark museum to educational activities for kids \n\nand students, a geopark landscape painting exhibition for students and kids, fieldtrips to \n\nthe geopark, sand sculpture festivals with a geopark theme in coastal areas, educational  \n\nprograms and field trips for teachers and earthquake manoeuvres for students and kids \n\ncan be useful enterprises to increase local public knowledge about geology and the \n\ngeopark.  \n\nFurthermore, adding a chapter about Qeshm Geopark and its targets in geology and  \n\ngeography books of primary, secondary and high schools can be a good strategy for  \n\nintroducing the Qeshm Geopark and its targets.  \n\nRecently, Qeshm Geopark authorities attempted to organize workshops on geopark activi-\n\nties for local business people and government. Moreover, authorities of Qeshm Geopark \n\nsupport master and PhD theses related to geopark activities.    \n\nAt present workshops are not managed by local communities of geopark territory and only \n\na few persons are involved in Qeshm Geopark museum as leaders. Thus, it can be said \n\nthat Qeshm Geopark does not have the dynamic as other geoparks in the contribution to \n\nincrease the geological knowledge and employment of local communities in workshops \n\nand schools.  \n\n \n\n5.2.2.  Summary and Conclusions \n\nOn the basis of the results of data analyses, field trip observation and literature review in \n\nchapter 5 part 1 and chapter 2, it can be concluded that Qeshm Geopark, as the first \n\ngeopark in the Middle East, can play a role in the development of geotourism marketing \n\nand local economy in rural areas of its territory. And the results support the expectations \n\nof the establishment of a geopark in rural areas.  \n\nBesides, the results of descriptive analysis in the Qeshm Geopark as a case study illus-\n\ntrate that the majority of local people (51%) believe that tourism has a negative impact on \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n272 \n\nthe local environment, but 54.4% of local respondents mentioned that creation of the \n\ngeopark has some environmental benefits in their territory. For instance, installing rubbish-\n\nbins, and signposts in villages, involving locals in conservation activities, and tourism  \n\n(local guardians for preserving turtles, garbage collectors in  coastal areas, local tour \n\nguides for turtle watching and plant propagation are enterprises which not only provide \n\nseasonal and part-time job opportunities and supplementary income for indigenous people \n\nbut also preserve the landscapes and the environment).  \n\nResponses indicate that local communities of Qeshm Geopark have positive attitudes  \n\ntowards development of tourism in their territory; 91.9% of respondents mentioned that \n\nthey are interested in expanding the tourist industry in their area. But they believe that \n\nthere are some negative sociocultural impacts of tourism development on local communi-\n\nties in the Qeshm Geopark such as the demise of the local language; vanishing local cus-\n\ntoms, and traditional way of life, taking as example local clothes.  \n\nApart from negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in this area, locals of the Qeshm \n\nGeopark introduced some positive tourism socioeconomic impacts which appeared \n\nthrough geopark activities in this area such as regional festivals, a seafood festival, sup-\n\nplementary income, cultural exchange, seasonal and part-time jobs, and entrepreneurship \n\nfor women. Consequently, geotourism can also contribute significantly to cultural preser-\n\nvation. This indicates that geoparks as pioneers in geotourism development can be  \n\nconsidered as a sustainable base for the development of tourism.   \n\nEngaging local communities in tourism sectors such as mangrove tours, turtle sites, \n\nhandicraft workrooms (needle work), and local accommodation, officials of Qeshm \n\nGeopark created second job opportunities or supplementary income for locals.   \n\nUnfortunately, Qeshm Geopark has a weak operation in educational programs for the  \n\nlocal schoolchildren, and has concentrated its educational activities just on the geopark \n\nmuseum, publications, some schools and graduate student theses. \n\nAs mentioned before, in 2010, UNESCO issued a yellow card for Qeshm Geopark; there-\n\nfore, authorities should solve the weakness problems of geopark. According to interviews \n\nwith geopark authorities and field trips around the Qeshm Geopark territories, some of the \n\nweakness problems are pointed out as follows:  \n\n1. Weakness problem in neighbourhood boundary of Qeshm Geopark. Since the \n\nQeshm Geopark was established in 2006, and at that time the geopark and geot-\n\nourism were not studied thoroughly yet and geopark authorities were not familiar \n\n\n\nChapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) \n\n    273 \n\nwith these new concepts, the neighbourhood boundary of Qeshm Geopark has \n\nsome weaknesses. For instance, some important sites such as the Valley of Stars \n\nand the Laft village are located outside the geopark territory.  \n\n2. A weakness problem in the dossier of Qeshm Geopark. Geopark authorities \n\nshould rewrite a new dossier with emphasis on geopark activities regarding the  \n\nlocal development, conservation and education, beside the aesthetic appeals.    \n\n3. Determinants of a budget deficit in Qeshm Geopark for implementation of the \n\ngeopark plan. As mentioned before, the geopark is under the supervision of \n\nQeshm Free Zone Organization. Unfortunately the managers of this organization \n\nmisunderstood geopark activity and they think that the geopark concept only  \n\nincludes geological heritage. Therefore, they did not support the geopark in the  \n\nfinancial cases appropriately.  \n\n4. Lack of network activities in management of the geopark. \n\n5. Management of Qeshm Free Zone Organization is weak from the nature conserva-\n\ntion viewpoint. Allocation of some unique coasts and islands to petroleum  \n\ncompanies is an example in this regard.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6- Conclusions and \nImplications \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications \n\n275 \n\n6.1.  Introduction \n\nThis thesis aims to understand the role of the establishment of geoparks in rural \n\ndevelopment. Moreover, this thesis tries to propose new tourism destination choices which \n\nwould improve understanding of earth sciences such as geology, geomorphology \n\ngeodiversity, and geography.   \n\nThis chapter presents the major conclusions of the thesis, discusses limitations, \n\ncontributions and managerial implications of the study. Specific suggestions for Qeshm \n\nGeopark are also discussed for the development and marketing of geotourism in this area.  \n\nIt proceeds with recommendations that may provide suggestions for future research.  \n\n \n\n6.2.  Main Conclusion \n\nAccording to National geographic (2005), geotourism is a sustainable strategy. Moreover, \n\nthe Lanzarote Charter for Sustainable Tourism (1995) defined 18 principles for \n\nsustainability. In recent decades, geoparks as new model of sustainable development in \n\nprotected areas through geotourism strive to promote local economy especially in rural \n\nareas (UNESCO, 2006b; Zouros, 2004; Zouros, and Mckeever, 2009). Nevertheless, none \n\nof the research works have considered the novel and innovative strategies applied in \n\ngeoparks for sustainable development. Innovation plays an important role for sustainable \n\ncompetitiveness and idea generation in research; and development is an essential part of \n\nit. However, in the present study the idea of building hypotheses and objectives raised \n\nfrom literature reviews.  \n\nIn this study I try to introduce geoparks as an innovation in tourist destination and consider \n\ninnovative strategies to improve the local economy of geoparks as environmentally \n\nsensitive areas. The main objective of the study presented in this thesis is a contribution to \n\nsustainable tourism in geoparks. Since development of local economy is a target of \n\nsustainable tourism, I attempt to ascertain the effects of creation of geoparks on \n\nsustainable tourism and local economy. Moreover, this thesis explores the effect of \n\nestablishment of geoparks on participation of local communities in geotourism marketing \n\nand geopark activities. The research at international level was conducted with electronic \n\nquestionnaires which were sent to all geoparks, along with the questionnaires filled by \n\ngeoparks officials who participated in the 8th European Geoparks Conference, Naturtejo \n\nGeopark, Portugal 2009. As there are countries with more than one geopark such as \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and implications \n\n276 \n\nJapan (it has established a network of national geoparks), just one or two geoparks \n\nreplied to us as a representative of all the others.  \n\nResults substantiate the importance of geoparks in employing locals in the management \n\nstructure and in promoting local businesses such as geotourism marketing and production \n\nlocal products.  \n\nSince we selected Qeshm Geopark as a case study at local level, another questionnaire \n\nwas designed for the local communities of Qeshm Geopark villages. \n\nThe literature review was an essential step to progress in the research. It focused mainly \n\non geotourism, geoparks and the concepts related to them. The literature review (chapter \n\n2) introduced a geopark as an area with interesting geological features or phenomena to \n\nbe protected and to be used for educational, scientific, or touristic purposes. Besides, \n\ngeoparks create opportunities for local economic development. It is noteworthy that in \n\ncomparison with protected areas a geopark has more subtle connections with the local \n\nsocial and cultural life, offering a wider range of activities such as local festivals, fairs, \n\nlocal art workshops, conferences, and educational programs.  \n\nSince, the majority of geoparks are located in rural areas, geoparks and geotourism can \n\nbe opportunities for cultural sustainability and rural development; they also try to reduce \n\nthe rate of unemployment and emigration through engaging local communities in geopark \n\nactivities.  \n\nGeopark authorities attempt to improve the local economy through geotourism, education, \n\nconservation activities, and innovative strategies.  \n\nChapter 3 examined the methodology used for research study. Chapter 4, part 1 reviewed \n\ncharacterization of areas where the empirical study were conducted and addressed the \n\nunique geological heritage sites in each geopark as geotourism destinations. In addition, \n\nchapter 4, part 1 provided an overview of innovative strategies in geoparks.  \n\nChapter 5, part 1 refers to the characterization of the geographical area of the Qeshm \n\nGeopark as a case study. This chapter summarized the geological, ecological, and \n\ncultural heritage sites in the Qeshm Geopark. Moreover, indicators of sustainable \n\ndevelopment for Qeshm Geopark were determined. Since, after the first revalidation a \n\nyellow card was issued for Qeshm Geopark by UNESCO, section 5.1.6 in chapter 5 \n\nfocused on designing three SWOT matrices regarding better management of geosites, \n\necological sites and cultural and archaeological heritage sites in Qeshm Geopark.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications \n\n277 \n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that comments mentioned in the SWOT matrices were suggested \n\naccording to experiences derived from innovation and novel strategies in other geoparks \n\naround the world registered in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network.   \n\nChapter 4, part 2 and Chapter 5, part 2 deal with findings of the empirical study at \n\ninternational level (geoparks registered in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network), and at \n\nlocal level (Qeshm Geopark).  \n\nOn the basis of the results of descriptive analyses of questionnaires, geopark authorities \n\nhave taken some positive policies stimulating locals in participating in activities leading to \n\nprosperity of the local economy and preservation of natural resources: \n\nFirstly, geopark authorities try to involve locals in conservation activities; results illustrate \n\nthat the creation of a geopark in each territory engages an average of about 11 persons in \n\ngeopark conservation activities in form of voluntary, supplementary income, part-time, full-\n\ntime ,seasonal, and second jobs (Mean= 10.53, SD= 14.78). \n\nMoreover, results indicate that the majority (83%) of geopark authorities believe that \n\nconservation activities improve the local economy in their territory; for instance, geoparks \n\nemploy the local communities in preservation activities such as park guards, site \n\nsurveillance, and projects. \n\nBesides, results of descriptive analysis in the case study, the Qeshm Geopark, illustrate \n\nthat the majority of local people (51%) believe that tourism has negative impact on the \n\nlocal environment; however, 54.4% of local respondents mentioned that the creation of \n\ngeopark has some environmental benefits in their territory. For instance, installing rubbish \n\nbins, and signposts in villages, involving locals in conservation activities, and tourism \n\n(local guardians for preserving turtles, garbage collectors in coastal areas, local tour \n\nguides for turtle watching and plant propagation are enterprises which not only provide \n\nseasonal job opportunities and supplementary income for indigenous people but also \n\npreserve the landscapes and the environment). The above results can confirm these \n\nhypotheses (H1: Geoparks involve local communities in conservation activities, H2: \n\nGeoparks have positive socio-environmental impacts on local communities, and H7: \n\nGeoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employment of local \n\ncommunities in rural areas and geopark territories).  \n\nAccordingly, there is an interaction between local socioeconomic development and \n\nconservation of the natural environment of the geopark.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and implications \n\n278 \n\nAside from conservation activities, in the second strategy, geoparks \u2013 through promoting \n\ngeotourism in their territory \u2013 strive to revive traditional culture and minimize the negative \n\ncultural impacts of tourism.  \n\nFor sociocultural sustainable development, geoparks hold local workshops, festivals, fairs, \n\nand educational programs. Moreover, geoparks through innovative strategies try to \n\nintroduce the locals\u2019 traditional skills to tourists. For example, geo-products which are \n\nmade based on geological elements of the geoparks not only introduce the local products \n\nand the local handicrafts to visitors, but increase the public knowledge of visitors about \n\ngeology and geomorphology. Thus, geotourism allows tourists and visitors to travel in their \n\nterritory in order to get experience, learn from and enjoy earth heritage.  \n\nBased on the results of the descriptive analysis, the establishment of a geopark can be a \n\nway to promote regional food and craft businesses as cultural components in rural areas; \n\nthe majority of respondents (80.0%) mentioned that the creation of geoparks can play a \n\nrole in promoting local cuisine, products, and handicrafts as cultural components.  \n\nFindings also demonstrate that geoparks attempt to revive traditional food, local arts, and \n\ntraditional culture through exposing them to tourists; thereby, geoparks, by promoting \n\ngeotourism and innovative strategies can reduce the negative sociocultural impacts of \n\ntourism in their territory.  \n\nResponses indicate that the local people of Qeshm Geopark have positive attitudes \n\ntowards tourism development in their territory, and 91.9% of respondents illustrated \n\ninterest in expanding the tourist industry in their area. But they believe that there are some \n\nnegative sociocultural impacts of tourism development on local communities in the Qeshm \n\nGeopark such as the demise of the local language, vanishing of local customs and \n\ntraditional way of life, taking as an example the local clothes.  \n\nApart from negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in this area, locals of the Qeshm \n\nGeopark introduced some positive socioeconomic impacts of tourism which appeared \n\nthrough geopark activities in this area such as regional festivals, seafood festivals, \n\nsupplementary income, cultural exchange, seasonal and part-time jobs, and \n\nentrepreneurship for women. Consequently, geotourism can also contribute significantly to \n\ncultural preservation. This shows that geoparks as pioneers in geotourism development \n\ncan be considered as a sustainable base for tourism development. It is evident that the \n\nresults mentioned above can confirm the following hypotheses:  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications \n\n279 \n\n\u2022 H5: Geoparks contribute to promoting regional geotourism products and local \n\nproducts \n\n\u2022 H6: Geoparks promote geotourism through innovative strategies  \n\n\u2022 H8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of \n\ntourism perceived by the local communities  \n\nA geopark should represent a topography (a landscape), which has a sufficient size to \n\ngenerate economic activities, especially through tourism. In the third strategy, geoparks \n\nencourage the local communities to participate in tourism activities; results of \n\nquestionnaires illustrate that the majority (80%) of responders believe that involving the \n\nlocal businessmen in tourism marketing such as tours, is the best way to promote the local \n\neconomy; moreover 68% of geoparks try to link their activities to other local tourism \n\nactivities such as boating, bird watching, cultural activities, etc.   \n\nBesides, geoparks with a view to the development of the local economy strive to support \n\nlocal products and services through a label (36%) or direct marketing of regional products \n\n(36%).  \n\n48% of geoparks through creating second or seasonal jobs for the local communities \n\nattempt to generate supplementary income for them.  \n\nEngaging locals in tourism sectors such as mangrove tours, handicraft workrooms (needle \n\nwork), local accommodation, and turtle sites, officials of Qeshm Geopark created second \n\njob opportunities or supplementary income for the local communities.   \n\nDeveloping human resources in the tourism industry faces unique challenges, because \n\ncustomers\u2019 preferences, travel patterns, information technology, and the conditions at \n\ndestinations are changing rapidly. As a result, some strong and flexible human resources \n\ndevelopment strategies are needed. Strategies for human resources development in the \n\ntourism sector should highlight the role of the private sector, with the government acting \n\nas a catalyst to provide situations and guidelines.  \n\nIn this regard, establishing a Local or National Geopark Network is the fourth strategy in \n\ngeoparks. A local and/or national geopark network achieves a great partnership with \n\nbusiness entities, libraries, student facilities, farms, camping and caravanning sites, \n\nhotels, hostels, restaurants, bars, tourism offices, NGOs, and nature tour guides. \n\nFurthermore, geoparks can train local geotour guides and local outdoor companies under \n\nthe umbrella of the national geopark network.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and implications \n\n280 \n\nIt is evident that geopark are established at international levels but managed at local \n\nlevels, the majority of geoparks (52%) are managed officially, and in the most countries \n\ngeoparks (52%) are financially supported by local municipalities (H9: Geoparks do not \n\nfunction similarly in terms of management).  \n\nThe members of the European Geopark Network and Global Geoparks Network entitled \n\ngeoparks to use the logos on their promotional material. These logos must be used only \n\non products related to geopark activities.  \n\nSubsequently, using the geopark brand in local businesses is the fifth strategy in the \n\ndevelopment of local economy and geotourism markets. Results of responses illustrate \n\nthat the majority of geoparks (84%) take advantage of the geopark brand in geotourism \n\nmarketing (in festivals, publications, research projects, common marketing, higher \n\nprestige, accommodation, restaurants, educational programs, and local business); \n\nmoreover, some local producers use the geopark brand for their products. The \n\naforementioned results can confirm the third and the fourth hypotheses (H3:  Geotourism \n\nactivities in geoparks create opportunities for local development, and H4: Using \n\ngeotourism can be a useful strategy for developing tourism in geoparks).   \n\nAn education program is another strategy in geoparks. A geopark can create a framework, \n\nmotivation, and support to integrate research, education, and training.  \n\nBased on the results of formula related to Network analysis (Network Connection Rate \n\n(CN= 0.65) and Maximum Connectivity of the Network (MCN= 666)), Network activity in \n\nEGN is stronger than in the GGN. There are no disconnected nodes in the EGN, and all of \n\nthe geoparks are involved in network activities.  \n\nThe EGN and GGN have concentrated their network activity in collaboration areas of \n\nmeetings, conferences, and exchange of knowledge. In addition, the authorities of \n\ngeoparks attempt to develop tourism marketing in their territory as well. Therefore, the \n\nresults can also confirm the tenth and the eleventh hypotheses (H10: Network activity in \n\nthe EGN is stronger than in the GGN, and H11: The majority of collaboration in the GGN \n\nand EGN is concentrated in the field of exchange of knowledge and knowledge transfer).  \n\nA geopark organizes activities and provides logistic support to convey geo-scientific \n\nknowledge and environmental concepts to the public. This is accomplished through \n\nprotected and interpreted geosites, museums, information centres, trails, guided tours, \n\nschool class excursions, popular literature, maps, educational materials and displays, \n\nseminars, workshops, meetings and so on.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications \n\n281 \n\nA geopark also fosters scientific research and cooperation with universities and the \n\nresearch institutes, stimulating the negotiation between the geosciences and the local \n\npopulation. Results also indicate that the majority of geoparks (72%) have been equipped \n\nwith workshop facilities and 56% of geoparks authorities believe that workshops improve \n\nthe local economy through involving locals, artists, geologists, etc. in workshops. \n\nUnfortunately, Qeshm Geopark is the only geopark which has a weak operation in \n\neducational programs for local schoolchildren. Qeshm has concentrated its educational \n\nactivities just on geopark museums, some workshops, graduate students\u2019 theses, and \n\npublications. It is worth mentioning that recently they organized an educational program \n\nand field trips for some schoolchildren of the geopark.  \n\nThe last but not the least geopark strategy is innovative activities; a new vision of \n\ngeotourism and geoparks can create new products (geo-products, geo-menu in \n\nrestaurants, etc.), new jobs (geotours, geo-restaurants, geo-bakeries, and rural hotels), \n\nand new recreational activities (geo-sports, geo-monuments, geosites, geopark museums, \n\ngeological gardens, etc.) for local communities and visitors.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that these recreational activities that are in some way related to \n\ntopography and geology are pedagogic tools for geotourists, who want to know more \n\nabout the earth which they are living on.    \n\nLastly, results of the descriptive analysis illustrate that annually an average of 7.8 million \n\ngeotourists visit geoparks around the world. These numbers of geotourists in European \n\ngeoparks are about average of 4.3 million per year. Obviously, the creation of a geopark \n\nand development of geotourism marketing as a branch of sustainable tourism can be a \n\nsolution for local development.  \n\nImplementation of a geopark and geotourism plan in geopark territories can contribute to \n\nraising standards of living of local people who otherwise would not have access to them, \n\nespecially because most geoparks are located in less favoured areas.  \n\nThe geotourism \u2018emerging tourism\u2019 niche is still in an early stage of commercial \n\ndevelopment, and geoparks located in rural areas experience slow economic \n\ndevelopment, but we trust that in the near future geoparks will be known as new \n\ngeotourism destinations for those who want to know more.  \n\nConsequently, sustainable employment at the local level may be achieved by supporting \n\nand developing small and medium sized businesses for instance those involved in tourism \n\nin the form of ecotourism and geotourism, conservation, education, gastronomy, and the \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and implications \n\n282 \n\nproduction of new products such as geo-products or production and sale of local products. \n\nThe development of outdoor companies, outdoor educational activities and facilities for \n\ngeo-sports can generate new and sustainable jobs. The establishment of information \n\ncentres in geosites, geoparks and themed museums, fairs, and exhibitions can help to \n\ngenerate temporary employment for designers and provide permanent employment for \n\nlocal people. In addition, the creation of new geopark souvenirs and handicrafts can be a \n\nmeans for sociocultural sustainability in rural areas and geoparks territories.  \n\n \n\n6.3.  Contributions and Managerial Implications  \n\nThe present study certainly benefits from previous works, especially the ones concerning \n\ngeopark and geotourism concepts and current issues in innovation and novel strategies in \n\ngeoparks.  \n\nTourism marketing is diverse, and dynamic, and it can be studied at a number of levels \n\nand from many perspectives. This study focuses on the new branch of nature tourism \n\nmarketing named geotourism which follows sustainability principles. This branch is a niche \n\nmarket with an emphasis on the \u2018geo\u2019 (geology, geomorphology, geodiversity, and \n\ngeography).  \n\nIn the academic sphere, this study can serve as a reference to enrich the field of tourism \n\nstudy named geotourism. It makes a contribution to the body of knowledge both in \n\ngeography and tourism fields.  \n\nOur knowledge is pioneering in the method of comparison between geoparks and social \n\nnetwork methods in geoparks. Moreover, this thesis tries to ascertain the novel strategies \n\nand innovation in geoparks for achieving targets of the creation of geopark (development \n\nof local economy through geotourism, education, and conservation of natural, geological, \n\nand cultural heritage).  \n\nThe theoretical framework of the expansion strategy of geoparks was supported by \n\nempirical results at international level (geoparks registered in the UNESCO Global \n\nGeoparks Network) and at the local level (local communities of the Qeshm Geopark).  \n\nFindings have practical value for researchers in the tourism field especially those who are \n\ninterested in new tourism destinations.  \n\nAnother contribution of the thesis was introducing a new means for development of local \n\neconomy and natural and cultural sustainability in rural areas.   \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications \n\n283 \n\nAccording to the social network method in this study, the majority of collaboration in the \n\nUNESCO Global Geoparks Network concentrated on the fields of meetings, exchange of \n\nknowledge and conferences. Consequently, it can be said that at present, exchange of \n\nknowledge is an important target in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network activity. \n\nMoreover, development of tourism marketing is the fourth target of network activities in \n\nUNESCO Global Geoparks.  \n\nIt is evident that in order to encourage rural development, the members of UNESCO \n\nGlobal Geoparks Network should pay more attention to tourism marketing in the form of \n\necotourism and geotourism.   \n\nRegarding development of the local economy, rural accommodations, Small and Medium-\n\nSized Enterprises (SMEs), local companies, producers, and artists located in geoparks \n\ncan benefit from a better understanding of the impact of a local network in their territory.  \n\nConsequently, this thesis contributes to the body of knowledge on introducing new tourism \n\ndestinations and a new tourism product (geotourism).  \n\n \n\n6.4.  Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research \n\n6.4.1.  Limitations \n\nThe research encountered some limitations that caused some difficulties in collecting the \n\nrequired data; firstly, since geopark and geotourism are relatively new concepts, it \n\nappears that there are a few scientific studies in this regard on which the researcher could \n\ncount on.   \n\nThere were some other limitations which reduced the rate of data collection.  One of these \n\nwas that the questionnaires were only available in three languages (English, Persian, and \n\nPortuguese). Since, in most geoparks, these languages are not the mother tongues, \n\ncollecting the data took a long time for just 25 responses (from March 2009 to January \n\n2010).    \n\nFurthermore, we not only sent the electronic questionnaires to geoparks, but also called \n\ngeoparks offices several times to remind them to fill out the questionnaire and distributed \n\nthe questionnaire at the 8th European Geoparks Network conference, Portugal. It is \n\nnoteworthy that geoparks from China did not fill in the first questionnaires.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and implications \n\n284 \n\nAside from international questionnaires, we designed a questionnaire for local \n\ncommunities of Qeshm Geopark (Iran). We travelled to Qeshm Geopark during two \n\nsummers (2008-2009).   \n\nThe other problem was that the terms of geopark and geotourism were new terms for \n\nlocals, so I had to first explain those new terms to them.  \n\nWe overcame all the aforementioned limitations, and we hope that the result of this thesis \n\nopens a new gateway to introduce geoparks as a tourism destination and tools for rural \n\ndevelopment.       \n\n   \n\n6.4.2.  Suggestions for Future Research \n\nGeoparks and Geotourism are new approaches of sustainability. Nowadays, the earth is \n\nfaced with problems such as global warming, air pollution, acid rain, depletion of the \n\nozone layer, loss of forests, desertification, waste disposal toxic chemicals in waters, soil \n\nerosion, mass extinction and pollution of beaches, oceans, reservoirs and waterways. \n\nRegarding this the government in each sector should try to minimize the negative impacts \n\nof economic sectors on environment.  \n\nIn the tourism sector, the appearance of sustainable tourism, ecotourism, and geotourism \n\nwere positive steps for preventing mass tourism and land destruction.  \n\nGeoparks \u2013 as pioneers in development of geotourism \u2013 are a novel strategy for earth \n\npreservation together with the promotion of sustainable tourism in rural areas.  \n\nThe study of tourism demand, tourism demography, tourism satisfaction, evaluation of the \n\nTourism Carrying Capacity, the Climate Index for Tourism (CIT) and Tourism Climate \n\nIndex (TCI), determination of Indicators for sustainable tourism development in geoparks \n\nterritory, special attention to financial slacks, policy and management, innovation, \n\ncompetition marketing, open marketing opportunities such as network activities and niche \n\nmarketing are key issues for future tourism management in geoparks.   \n\nIn the near future, pursuant to the increase of the population, different kinds of stress will \n\nbe generated, and so tourists in 21st century need relaxation more than in years past. \n\nSince the majority of geoparks are located in the rural areas, geopark territories can be \n\ngood tourism destinations for relaxation.     \n\nAccording to the information filled in on forms by geopark authorities some geoparks \n\nattempt to create some facilities for relaxation of tourists in their territory: establishing spa \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications \n\n285 \n\ntherapy centres in Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), Nature park Terra.Vita (Germany), \n\nBohemian Paradise (Czech Republic) and Itoigawa Geopark (Japan); promoting Malay \n\nherbal treatments in Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia); organizing medicinal herb tours in \n\nEisenwurzen Geopark (Austria) and promoting geo-therapy such as mud therapy, hydro \n\ntherapy, peat therapy, ice therapy, and paraffin wax therapy in Swabian Alb Geopark \n\n(Germany) are good examples in this regard.  \n\nIn the 21st century the tourism sector should pay particular attention to the accessible \n\ntourism market and senior tourism market.  \n\nIt is evident that seniors are retired and have more time and money for travelling. As a \n\nresult, creating facilities and opportunities for the senior tourism market in geoparks can \n\nmove money to geopark territories.  \n\nThe accessible tourism market as niche marketing which involved disabilities, seniors and \n\nthose with temporary incapacities are also part of the tourism market dynamics. Disabled \n\nvisitors need new services and facilities.  \n\nThe Greenwalk Company in Portugal which opened a geo-accessible tour in July 2011 \n\nwith 8 blind visitors can be good example for development of accessible geotourism.  Geo \n\nAccessible has been integrating four-wheel-drive (4WD) trails as well (Tavares, 2011).  \n\nCreating educational tools for disabled students and visitors can help to promote \n\neducational activities as a main target of geoparks for attracting new visitors.  \n\nPublishing Braille handbooks, tourism guidebooks for blind students and visitors, \n\npreparing video clips and organizing workshops about geoparks for deaf/mute visitors and \n\nschoolchildren with the help of the persons who are familiar with the deaf-and-dumb \n\nalphabet, training geo-tour guides for deaf/mute visitors, preparing geo-trails and \n\nexhibitions, interpretative centres for disabled and senior visitors are examples of \n\nintegrating geotourism marketing with the accessible tourism market in the future through \n\ngeoparks.  \n\nAs mentioned before the study of tourism demand and tourism demography in each \n\ngeopark territory is a prerequisite for tourism development in the future. Todd (2001) noted \n\nthat the arrival numbers of visitors can be a reliable economic indicator in tourism \n\ndestinations. Thus organizing some projects regarding tourism demand in geoparks is a \n\nfundamental study for the development of tourism in the future. The numbers of domestic \n\nand international visitor arrivals in each geopark, and the level of their education and \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and implications \n\n286 \n\nexpenditure, the duration of stay of visitors, tourism profile and the level of their \n\nsatisfaction are key components for tourism management in geoparks territory. \n\nThrough these tourism studies, decision-making about the type of tourism facilities and \n\nservices in geoparks will become easier. It is obvious that the evaluation of tourism \n\nmarketing through the needs of customers enables better management of tourism \n\ndestinations for governors.   \n\nFor instance, if the majority of visitors in the geopark are categorized as young, geopark \n\nauthorities should focus more on recreational activities such as geo-sports, adventure and \n\nfun activities (geo-rafting, climbing, geo-kayaking, etc.); and, if their education level is high \n\nofficials should pay particular attention to the preparation of geotourism maps, \n\ninterpretative panels, thematic museums and workshops, etc.  \n\nAnother main external new trend that will strongly affect the tourism industry is climate \n\nchange (Costa and Buhalis, 2006). Climate is a key component for many types of tourism, \n\nespecially ecotourism and geotourism. Evaluating the Climate Index for Tourism (CIT) and \n\nTourism Climate Index (TCI) for each geopark and preparing the TCI map for geoparks \n\nterritory can be a strategy for tourism satisfaction.  \n\nAccording to some authors (Freitas et al., 2008; Farajzadeha and Matzarakis, 2009; \n\nKarimi , 2010) , weather/climate and tourism/recreation are interconnected, and tourists, \n\ntour organizers, travel agencies, tourism planners and stakeholders need to be reliably \n\ninformed about the role of weather and climate.  \n\nThe Tourism Climate Index (TCI) was proposed by Mieczkowski (1985), in order to use \n\nclimate data for tourist destinations worldwide. This index computes the best months for \n\ntravelling to a territory in the future.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that these climate indexes can help to design geopark calendars and \n\nprograms. For example during the months with excellent, very good and good TCI ratings, \n\ngeopark authorities should organize the geotours, cruises, and some geo-sports such as \n\nrafting, organizing tours for seniors, etc. and during the good and acceptable TCI periods, \n\nofficials can concentrate on educational activities in universities, schools, kindergartens, \n\nmuseums and interpretive centres. \n\nFreitas et al. (2008) illustrated that evaluation of the rates of Climate Index for Tourism \n\n(CIT) can play an important role in activities that are highly climate/weather sensitive, \n\nspecifically, beach \u201csun, sea and sand\u201d.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications \n\n287 \n\nTherefore, computing this parameter can be a useful strategy for the development of \n\ntourism in geoparks located in coastal areas and that are members of the coastal thematic \n\ngroup (e.g. Shetland, Petrified Forest of Lesvos, Gea-Norvegica, Copper Coast, Geo Mon, \n\nand English Riviera geoparks).  \n\nSince conservation is one of the targets for geoparks, determining Tourism Carrying \n\nCapacity in geopark territories is an important factor in the preservation of natural heritage \n\nand development of sustainable tourism. Tourism Carrying Capacity is defined by the \n\nWorld Tourism Organization as \u201cThe maximum number of people that may visit a tourist \n\ndestination at the same time, without causing destruction of the physical, economic, \n\nsociocultural environment and an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors' \n\nsatisfaction\u201d.  \n\nIn addition to Tourism Carrying Capacity, sustainable development indicators can lead to \n\nbetter decisions and more effective actions by simplifying, clarifying, and making \n\naggregated information available to policy makers (United Nations, 2007). Determining \n\nsustainable development indicators can help to integrate social science and physical \n\nknowledge into decision-making; they can also be important components to measure \n\nprogress towards sustainable development goals. They can provide an early warning to \n\nprevent negative economic, social, and environmental impacts. These indicators are \n\nimportant for implementation of tourism management planning.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that in geopark management authorities should pay particular \n\nattention to sustainable tourism principles as well. In view of the fact that the tourists in the \n\n21st century are different from the past, they want to gain more experiences from travel \n\nand sightseeing together with the experience of unique facilities and attractions. In recent \n\ndecades, the numbers of educated tourists have increased, so they need a new leisure \n\nmarket, niche products and services. Creating this kind of products requires searching \n\nabout the scope of the local economy, professionalism and innovation. New markets \n\nrequire different products and services, thus innovation and innovative strategies can play \n\na role in promoting new markets.  \n\nNowadays, geoparks as open museums for the development of geotourism strive to offer \n\nnew geotourism facilities to visitors. Since geotravelers are interested in knowing more \n\nabout the earth where they live, geotourism as niche marketing, which emphasizes the \n\n\u2018geo\u2019 (geology, geomorphology, geodiversity, and geography) should pay particular \n\nattention to educational activities, and should try to achieve educational goals through \n\nrecreational activities. Geoparks, as pioneers for the development of geotourism, for \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and implications \n\n288 \n\ncreating geo-products and geo-services as leisure and pedagogic tools need innovation \n\nand professionals in geology, geomorphology and geography. Moreover, the \n\nestablishment of geo-restaurants, geo-museums, preparation facilities for geo-sports and \n\norganization of geotours demonstrate that geopark authorities are searching for a new \n\nleisure market and are trying to combine the earth sciences with recreational activities in \n\ngeopark territories.  \n\nNevertheless, study of geoparks and geotourism is classified in interdisciplinary sciences \n\nas well as tourism marketing, so collaboration and network activities between specialists \n\nin related sciences such as geology, geography, ecology, tourism, biology, agriculture, \n\nenvironment, etc., can be a useful strategy for better management of geoparks in the \n\npresent and future.   \n\nPerhaps the most important element in the future of geotourism is innovation and \n\ncompetition. Geoparks as messengers of geotourism should strengthen their \n\ncompetitiveness activities. At local level geoparks can hold thematic competitions for \n\nschoolchildren and local communities (e.g. painting, sand festivals, making thematic \n\ncakes, taking photographs, and producing geo-products). However, at an international \n\nlevel competition should concentrate on international projects. \n\nRegarding this, National Geographic held a global competition entitled \u201cGeotourism \n\nChallenge 2010: Places on the Edge \u2013 Saving Coastal &amp; Freshwater Destinations\u201d. \n\nEntrants can submit their ideas and proposals in the competition. This kind of competition \n\nis not only a strategy for collecting innovative ideas and brainstorms, but also the winner\u2019s \n\nprize can cover some part of the necessary financial budget for implementation of \n\nprojects.  \n\nGeotourism and geoparks should pay more attention to applying new technology in the \n\n21st century. As geopark and geotourism are new terms and they are still in an early \n\nstage of development, so virtual tours which are provided by the Geographic Information \n\nSystem (GIS), improving interactivity of geopark websites, expanding local TV channels, \n\nand Geopark online TV channels can play an important role in tourist attraction to these \n\nterritories. Therefore, expanding multimedia guides and self-guiding tours for geotourism \n\nsuch as TERRAGAZE mobile and geological multimedia kiosk in each geopark are other \n\nareas for further research.   \n\nEstablishment of thematic museums in geoparks, in accordance with the geological and \n\ngeomorphological phenomena in each geopark can be strategic to educate visitors.  \n\nMineral galleries and geothermal interpretive centres (in European Geoparks), desert (in \n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications \n\n289 \n\nMiddle East or African Geoparks), or petroleum museums (in Middle East Geoparks) are \n\nexamples in this regard. Thus, the thematic study of geoparks, thematic networks and \n\ngeo-museums are other subjects of future researches.  \n\nAccording to methodology, in this thesis the Social Network Analysis (SNA) method was \n\nused for visualizing UNESCO Global Geoparks Network and European Geoparks Network \n\nto ascertain the fields of their collaboration. Hence, it can be said that the use of Social \n\nNetwork Analysis (SNA) method in each geopark for better understanding of the impact of \n\nlocal networks on rural development is another area for future research.  \n\nThe last but not the least suggestion for future research is focusing on sustainable energy \n\nand geo-energy (coal, petroleum and geothermal, nuclear energy). Holding workshops on \n\ngeo-energy in related geoparks and providing infrastructures and facilities for the \n\nestablishment of eco-campsites and geo-campsites in geopark territories can help to \n\ndevelop sustainable tourism.    \n\nUsing the renewable resource of geothermal energy for cooling and heating of geo-\n\ncampsites and eco-campsites in geopark territories in the near future can be a positive \n\nstep toward sustainable development and sustainable tourism.   \n\nFigure 6.1 illustrates the topics for research in geotourism. Furthermore, future issues in \n\ngeopark research are summarized in Figure 6.2.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1- The topics for research in geotourism \n\nGeotourism\n\nGeographical Tourism\n\nNature Tourism \n\nThe Tourism of Geology\n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Conclusions and implications \n\n\u00a0\n\n290\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.2- Future issues in geoparks research \n\nFuture Management \n\n- Developing network activities in \nrural areas and among Geoparks  \n\n- Developing thematic clusters \n\n- Developing twinning agreement \nor sister partnership between \nGeoparks  \n\n- Developing involvement of local \ncommunities in geotourism and \nGeoparks activities  \n\nNew Trends for Future \nResearch \n\n-Study of geotourism demand, \ngeotourism satisfaction and \ngeotourism demography in \nGeoparks  \n\n- Evaluation of the Tourism Carrying \nCapacity in Geoparks  \n- Evaluation of Climate Index for \nTourism (CIT) in Geoparks located \nin coastal areas  \n\n- Evaluation of Tourism Climate \nIndex (TCI) in Geoparks \n\n- Development of accessible \ngeotourism in Geoparks  \n\n- Development of an economic \nmodel for Geoparks  \n\n- Search for new leisure market and \ntry to join the Earth sciences to \nrecreational activities in Geoparks \n\n- Study of using geo-energy and \nsustainable renewable energy such \nas geothermal, solar, etc in \ncampsites and facilities of Geoparks \n\nNew Tools for Future \n\n-Developing information communication \ntechnologies for each Geopark such as \nTERRAGAZE mobile as self geo-guide \ntour or virtual tours \n\n- Expanding local TV channels, and \nGeopark on line TV channels \n\n- Expanding online shops in Geoparks \nregarding local marketing promotion \n\n- Introducing the Geopark brand as a \nsustainable tourism brand    \n\n \nGeotourism \n\nGeoparks \n\nEmergence of New Customers \n(Geotravelers)  \n\nPreservation of geological and \ngeomorphological heritage   \n\nDevelopment of Rural Areas \n\nEmergence of a New Tourism \nProduct and New Destinations \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n291 \n\nAbdul Aziz, R.
