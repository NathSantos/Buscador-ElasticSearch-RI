Among those materials, nanoporous structures have gradually \n\naroused the attention of the scientific community. This interest is witnessed by the increasing \n\nnumber of publications about novel porous materials constructed from the assembly of molecular \n\nbuilding blocks such as metal-organic frameworks. The most recent examples are supramolecular \n\nporous frameworks. These architectures are built up through traditional noncovalent interactions \n\nsuch as hydrogen bonds, ?-? interactions. Most recent discoveries have found a novel type of \n\nbond that involves the participation of a halogen atom. This type of interaction assumes the name \n\nof halogen bond and is highly directional and hydrophobic. These features can be exploited for the \n\ndesign of defined structures.  \n\n \n\nThe present work is focused on the description of several halogen organic frameworks among \n\nwhich some of them present robust porous architectures. The structures were obtained by \n\ncombining the tetrafunctional XB acceptor hexamethylenetetramine with different halogen bond \n\ndonors. \n\n \n\nThe work is divided into three parts. The literature part gives a background about nanoporous \n\nmaterials and their evolution with a section dedicated to the description of the halogen bond. The \n\nexperimental section describes the methods used to obtain the supramolecular architectures. The \n\nfinal part discusses the structures and the noncovalent interactions that have driven their \n\nassembly. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Porosity; X-rays; Halogen bonds; Hydrogen bonds. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\niv Resumo \n\nResumo \n \n\nO cont\u00ednuo avan\u00e7o da nanotecnologia potenciou o desenvolvimento de novos materiais que \n\napresentam solu\u00e7\u00f5es para variadas problem\u00e1ticas, das quais s\u00e3o exemplos o armazenamento de \n\ngases e sua separa\u00e7\u00e3o, a cat\u00e1lise seletiva e o desenvolvimento e entrega de f\u00e1rmacos. Devido \u00e0s \n\nsuas propriedades, os materiais nanoporosos est\u00e3o a ganhar destaque, o que levou a um \n\naumento do n\u00famero de publica\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo dos \u00faltimos anos, sendo um dos exemplos mais \n\nrecentes as estruturas supramoleculares porosas. Estas arquiteturas s\u00e3o constru\u00eddas atrav\u00e9s de \n\nintera\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o covalentes, como as liga\u00e7\u00f5es de hidrog\u00e9nio e intera\u00e7\u00f5es ?-?.

Por sua vez, a parte experimental descreve a metodologia utilizada para \n\nobten\u00e7\u00e3o das estruturas supramoleculares em estudo. Por fim, a terceira sec\u00e7\u00e3o incide sobre a \n\ndiscuss\u00e3o acerca das referidas estruturas e respetivas intera\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o covalentes que levam \u00e0 sua \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Porosidade; Raios X; Ponte de Halog\u00e9nio; Ponte de Hidrog\u00e9nio. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nv Content \n\nContent \n \n\nAcknowledgments _______________________________________________________________ i \n\nAbstract ______________________________________________________________________ iii \n\nResumo ______________________________________________________________________ iv \n\nContent _______________________________________________________________________ v \n\nList of Figures ________________________________________________________________ viii \n\nList of Tables __________________________________________________________________ xi \n\nList of acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols ________________________________________ xii \n\n \n\nPart 1.

Introduction \n\n1. Introduction  \n\n \n\n1. 1 Nanoporous materials - an overview \n\n \n\nMaterials consisting of nanostructures are abundant in nature. Examples are proteins, DNA, or \n\neven thinking on nanoparticles used from millenniums to colour glasses and ceramics. The real \n\nnovelty of the last four decades relies on the increase of the ability to fabricate nanostructures and \n\nnanosystems with a great degree of control and using a diversity of techniques, accompanied by a \n\nsimilar enhancement in the ability to characterize structures and systems at the nanoscale.1 \n\nNowadays, nanomaterials are designed tailoring their properties and functionalities. Anyway, what \n\nis exactly nanotechnology, nanoscience and all those fields that encompass the nano-world? To \n\nanswer this question it would be appropriate to borrow the definition gave by Professor Roald \n\nHoffmann - the Chemistry Nobel Laureate in 1981: \"Nanotechnology is the way of ingeniously \n\ncontrolling the building of small and large structures, with intricate properties; it is the way of the \n\nfuture, with incidentally, environmental benignness built in by design\u2018\u2019.1  \n\nIts rise has started since the quantum physics laws prevailed to the classical ones that perfectly \n\nfit the description of macroscale phenomena. By decreasing the scale from macro to nano, the \n\nproperties of the matter change as the energy is discretised and its dependence on surface to \n\nvolume ratio surprisingly increases.  \n\nCertainly, several types of nanostructures materials exist. Among these, nanoporous ones \n\nrepresent one important type of nanostructures materials. They consist of a regular organic or \n\ninorganic framework supporting a regular, porous structure.1 They possess specific surface, \n\nstructural and bulk properties that make them applicable in many fields such as ion exchange, \n\nseparation, catalysis, sensor, and purification. Their pore size in the range of nm makes them \n\nsuitable for the absorption and the interaction with atoms.  \n\nBased on the pore size, it is possible to classify the nanoporous materials in three categories: \n\n1) Microporous \u2013 materials have pore diameters of less than 2 nm.2 \n\n2) Mesoporous \u2013 materials have pore diameters between 2 nm and 50 nm. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n2 Part 1. Introduction \n\n3) Macroporous \u2013 materials have pore diameters of greater than 50 nm.3 \n\n \n\nIn the present context, the attention is turned to those nanoporous solids possessing a pore size \n\nof similar magnitude or only slightly larger than common gas molecules. \n\nMore specifically, the next paragraphs give an overview of the different nanoporous materials \n\nfollowing the timeline of their development. Afterwards, the attention is focused on the organic \n\nframeworks spacing from the metal organic ones, the so-called MOFs until the recent halogen \n\norganic frameworks (XOFs) which represent the main object of this study. \n\n \n\n1. 2.1 The first example of nanoporous materials: Zeolites \n\n \n\nZeolite are natural mineral discovered in 1756 by the Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik \n\nCronstedt.4 He observed that after heating this mineral, steams of water were produced. This \n\nobservation inspired the mineralogist to call these materials zeolites, from the Greek ??? (z\u00e9?), \n\nmeaning \"to boil\" and ????? (l\u00edthos), meaning \"stone\".  \n\nZeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates of group IA and group IIA elements, such as sodium, \n\npotassium, magnesium, and calcium5 with microporous structures of usually below 1.0 nm in \n\ndiameter.6 They have the chemical formula M2/nOAl2O3\u00b7xSiO2\u00b7yH2O, where the charge-balancing \n\nnon-framework cation M has valence n, x is 2.0 or more, and y is the number of moles of water in \n\nthe voids.4 Therefore, they are solids with a relatively open, three-dimensional crystal structure \n\nbuilt from the elements aluminum, oxygen, and silicon, with alkali or alkaline metals plus water \n\nmolecules trapped in the gaps among them.7 Aluminium and silicon atoms form a three-\n\ndimensional structure of AlO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra linked together through an oxygen atom. If the \n\nSiO4 results already charge balanced, AlO4 is negatively charged and, thus, is balanced by a \n\ncation, M (Fig. 1). The content ratio of Si/Al modifies the properties of porous zeolite. More \n\nspecifically, a higher content of aluminium increases the acidity of the porous structure; oppositely, \n\na higher amount of silica makes the zeolitic environment more basic. Depending on the application, \n\nthe content ratio varies, and several zeolites with different properties are obtained.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralogy\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Fredrik_Cronstedt\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Fredrik_Cronstedt\nhttp://www.explainthatstuff.com/aluminum.html\nhttp://www.explainthatstuff.com/water.html\n\n\n \n\n \n\n3 Part 1. Introduction \n\nImportant characteristics of zeolites are high boiling points (over 1000\u00b0C), resistance to high \n\ntemperatures, high-pressure resistance and difficulties to dissolve in water and organic solvents. \n\nEven if all these properties are enough for making them good candidates for many applications, \n\nthey are more notable for their open, cage-like, framework structure. In fact, they present a high \n\nsurface to volume ratio, and, consequently, a huge porous volume. This peculiar feature led to their \n\nuse in separation, filtration, adsorption, and catalysis. Several types of natural zeolites exist such \n\nas chabazite, erionite, mordenite, and clinoptilolite. Anyway, the random size porous distribution \n\nmakes natural zeolites not suitable for many applications. Differently, manufactured zeolites \n\npresent a precise dimension and pore size distribution. \n\n \n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nOSi\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO-Al\n\nO\n\nO\n\nOSi\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO-Al\n\nMe+ Me\n+\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - a) Schematic structure of Zeolite and b) 3D network of silica and alumina in zeolite.8 \n\n \n\n \n\nOne of the most famous examples of synthetic zeolite applied for petroleum cracking process is \n\nZeolite Socony Mobil - 5 (ZSM-5) with the chemical formula NanAlnSi96\u2013nO192\u00b716H2O (0<n<27). \n\nThe Mobil Oil Company patented it in 1972 for the petroleum industry.

Argauer and George R. Landolt performed the first synthesis of ZSM-5 in 1969.10,11 \n\nTheir method consisted of a mixture of three solutions. One solution corresponded to the source of \n\naluminium, sodium and hydroxide ions. The second one contained tetrapropylammonium cation as \n\na templating agent. The third solution was the source of the other building block of zeolites, silica. \n\nThe mixture of the three solutions led to the supersaturation point of the tetrapropylammonium \n\nZSM-5. After heating and recrystallization, the solid ZSM-5 were obtained. \n\nEven though the proposed method was easy to perform, it presented some drawbacks such as \n\nthe use of toxic and readily inflammable ammines. The subsequent years witnessed other \n\nprocedures to synthetize ZSM-5 without involving dangerous compounds.12,13,14 \n\nThe next paragraph deals with the current role of zeolites in the industrial field. Mainly the \n\ncatalytic activity of them is presented showing advanced zeolitic structures such as nanocrystal \n\nzeolites and hierarchical zeolites.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n5 Part 1. Introduction \n\n1. 2.2 Zeolites current industrial application  \n\n \n\nZeolites can be divided into two categories, natural and synthetic zeolites. Even if the first ones \n\nwere discovered almost 250 years ago, their use for industrial applications came just when artificial \n\nzeolites were synthesized. Figure 3 presents the milestone in the history of Zeolites.15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Milestone in the history of Zeolites.15 \n\n \n\nThe major applications for synthetic zeolites are in ion exchange (detergents), \n\nadsorbents/desiccants and catalysis.16 They are also defined as molecular sieves to stress their \n\nability on allowing small molecules to enter the nanopores instead of the biggest ones. \n\nFor all those characteristics, they are intensively used, as already mentioned, in catalytic \n\nactivities. Catalyst materials are important for decreasing the activation energy barrier in a reaction. \n\nTheir application allows lower reaction temperatures to be used during the process. Zeolitic \n\ncatalysts are mainly employed in pharmaceutical drug production and in the petrochemical industry \n\nas catalytic crackers to break large hydrocarbon molecules into gasoline, diesel, kerosene, waxes \n\nand more petroleum by-products. Their catalytic activity is due to their porous structure. The \n\nseveral atoms and molecules once enter zeolites remain trapped into the tiny cavities and, thus, \n\nreactions readily take place.  \n\nOn the other hand, the narrow micropores of zeolites also imply access and diffusion \n\nlimitations17 of the reagents/products throughout the crystal. This threat can be solved either \n\ndecreasing the crystal size, creating nanocrystals zeolites with a size typically smaller than 0.5 \n\n\u00b5m,18 or through the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites.17 The reduction of the size of a particle from \n\nthe micrometer to the nanometer scale leads to substantial changes in the properties of zeolites, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n6 Part 1. Introduction \n\nand consequently of their performance in catalysis among other properties. The surface to volume \n\nratio increases by the decrease of materials dimension and zeolite nanoparticles acquire large \n\nexternal surface areas and high surface activity. In addition, smaller zeolite crystals have reduced \n\ndiffusion path lengths relative to conventional micrometer-sized zeolites.19 Tuel et al.18 reported an \n\nefficient method to synthesized hollow zeolites nanocrystals (ZSM-5) with a controllable wall \n\nthickness and chemical composition. The formation of holes in the crystals involves both partial \n\ndissolution and re-crystallization of the zeolite in the presence of a base and organic molecules. \n\nMore specifically, synthesized calcined silicalite-1 nanocrystals, with the composition \n\nSi96O192F4(TPA)4  were immersed in a solution of tetrapropylenammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) with \n\nwater and different contents of aluminium, introduced as aluminium nitrate Al(NO3)3, to obtain Si/Al \n\nmolar ratios between 25 and 100. The nanocrystals were obtained after periods of static heating at \n\n170\u00b0C.  Figure 4 shows TEM and SEM pictures of the nanocrystals obtained by simple \n\ncrystallization of silicalite-1 zeolites and after its dilution in TPAOH in the presence of aluminium, \n\ngetting ZSM-5. The \u2018\u2018nanoboxes\u201d possess very regular zeolitic walls, with a thickness in the 20\u201340 \n\nnm range. In SEM pictures is evident that internal voids never communicate with the outside via \n\nlarge pores, and that all zeolite nanoboxes look perfectly closed at the resolution of the pictures. \n\nThe presence of aluminium slightly influences the intracrystalline pore size and shape as possible \n\nto observe from TEM images. Values in Table 1 show that the volume is similar for hollow silicalite-\n\n1 and ZSM-5 zeolites obtained after dissolution of silicalite-1 in TPAOH solution in the presence of \n\naluminium.  \n\nNanocrystals zeolites have been recognized as a possible solution for the diffusion limitation \n\nthat such materials present. On the other hand, hierarchical zeolites have provided a new way to \n\navoid diffusion limitation.  \n\nA hierarchically organized zeolite (HOZ) is defined as a material that retains the crystalline order \n\nand associated functionality of bulk (purely microporous) zeolite, but that also integrates a \n\nmultilevel pore network.20 The new porous material is characterized by an interconnection of micro-\n\n, meso- and macropores to enhance the molecular transport in the active sites (Fig. 5). The \n\nadditional porosity levels can be configured either within (intracrystalline) or between \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n7 Part 1.

The orange spheres represent molecules that suffer from single-file \ndiffusion. The secondary porosity enhances the number of pore mouths to diffuse in and out of, as \nwell as the diffusion properties within the pores (indicated by the green spheres). In the latter case, \nthe introduction of external surface often leads to enhanced selectivity. The red dots represent \nbulky molecules, which can only react on pore mouths.17 \n\n \n\nApproaches to synthesize HOZs involve either interrupting their crystallization and growth in the \n\nsynthesis gel (bottom-up) or a post-synthetic removal or rearrangement of the atoms in a bulk \n\nzeolite (top-down) (Fig. 6).20  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                    a) Bottom-up                                                           b) Top-down \n \n\n \nFigure 6- a) Bottom-up from gel solution; b) top-down approach for nanoporous zeolites \nformation.20 \n\n \n\nNanocrystal zeolites and hierarchical zeolites represent significant advances for the \n\nrationalization of zeolite synthesis.21 However, the prediction of their final crystal structure is not \n\neasy as well as their functional tunability.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n9 Part 1. Introduction \n\nThe progress in coordination chemistry has led to the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks \n\n(MOFs), which imply a better prediction of the resulting crystal structure based on the knowledge of \n\nthe metal clusters and the organic ligands participating in the synthesis.22 \n\n \n\n1. 3.1 Metal Organic framework \u2013 An introduction \n\n \n\nGenerally, the robustness of a framework can be achieved by the combination of rigid organic \n\nmoieties and inorganic clusters. This attempt has led to the synthesis of the so-called metal-\n\norganic frameworks (MOFs) as shown in Figure 7.  \n\nThey consist of metal units, secondary building units (SBUs), linked with organic moieties using \n\ncoordination bonds (Fig. 8).23 \n\nThis new category of porous materials did not occupy the main role in the scientific panorama \n\nuntil 1990. Prior to the early 1980s, aluminosilicate zeolites and closely related systems \n\nrepresented the predominant class of open-framework materials with three-dimensional crystalline \n\nstructures.24,25,26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7- Molecular structure of the metal organic framework called Cu-BTC.

These \n\nconsist of metal ions joint together by organic ligands. As mentioned before, the real interest in \n\nporous coordination polymers and MOFs started only around 1990.24 These new structures have a \n\ngreat advantage over the common zeolites: more flexible rational design.29 Nevertheless, the \n\nstability of these hybrid structures was achieved later. Indeed, until the end of the \u201990, some issues \n\ncompromised their formation. First of all the final products were poorly crystallized and prevented \n\nstructure information from being obtained. Then, their thermal stability initially was low, and many \n\nstructures collapsed in the absence of the guest molecules.25 The evolution came with the \n\ndiscovery of MOF-5 by Yaghi and co-workers in 1999.29 \n\nIn Robson\u2019s paper30 published in 2008, it is traced the synthetic development of MOFs that led \n\nto the formation of a large range of crystalline, microporous, stable solids, possibly using structure-\n\ndirecting agents, with ion-exchange, gas sorption, or catalytic properties. \n\nMOFs have emerged as an extensive class of crystalline materials with ultrahigh porosity (up to \n\n90% free volume) and enormous internal surface areas, extending beyond 6 000 m2/g.24 This \n\nfeature combined with the changeable structure and properties caused by the large choice of both \n\norganic and inorganic components, make MOFs good candidates in applications such as clean \n\nenergy, storage of gases (e.g., hydrogen and methane), adsorbents for separation needs. More \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n11 Part 1. Introduction \n\npotential applications are catalysis and biomedical imaging. All these positive aspects have seen \n\nan increasing interest on MOFs parallel to the development of different chemistry fields:  \n\n1) Advances in cluster chemistry. \n\n2) Maturation of organic synthesis pertinent to ligand preparation and post-synthetic modification. \n\n3) Improvement in structure determination, particularly through X-Ray crystallography, and \n\ndevelopment of hard- and software for evaluation of sorption properties. \n\n4) Interdisciplinary growth of MOF research with its neighbouring fields. \n\n5) The ever-expanding potential in applications.31 \n\nOne more important feature of MOFs is their geometrically well-defined structure. This property \n\nfurther implies that these solids should be crystalline, an important criterion for the precise \n\nestablishment of structure-property relationships.32 Nevertheless, this is not the only implication. \n\nThe knowledge of possible topologies, the functionality of multitopic organic linker molecules, as \n\nwell as the understanding of typical metal coordination environments, helps to understand and \n\ndirect the synthesis efforts. As ultrahigh porosity is the feature that made MOFs so famous, the \n\nmain goal in MOF synthesis is to establish the conditions that lead to a framework, which does not \n\ncollapse. \n\nMoreover, as they are crystalline solids, a tuneable kinetics of crystallization is of huge \n\nimportance to guarantee the nucleation and, consequently, the growth of crystals. As nothing is \n\nknown in details about their crystal growth and nucleation process, a new type of MOF is \n\ndiscovered by the common trial-and-error method. \n\nFirst of all, the formation of this kind of hybrid frameworks is a consequence of supramolecular \n\nchemistry.30 Thus in the assembly process, two subunits have to be combined, organic ligands and \n\nmetal precursors.33 Whereas the organic ligands are supplied directly as a reactant, the SBUs \n\nhave to be formed in the synthesis process from the metal precursors. What results crucial is the \n\nSBUs synthesis that ascertains the MOF assembly process.29 The advantage to common \n\nnanoporous materials such as zeolite is the easiness on tuning their structure and functionality \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n12 Part 1. Introduction \n\nduring synthesis. Moreover, as the subunits of MOFs are the metal coordination centres and the \n\norganic linkers, by changing the last ones, it is possible to obtain a wide range of structures that \n\ndiffer from pores \u2018size, chemical functionalities and affinities for guest molecules.28,34 \n\nDepending on the different stages of synthesis involved, MOFs are classified as  \n\ni) first generation (normal MOFs);  \n\nii) second generation (functionalized MOFs);  \n\niii) third generation (smart MOFs).  \n\nFirst-generation MOFs possess the traditional architecture having an inorganic and organic moiety, \n\nsecond-generation MOFs are subjected to surface modifications through chemical functionalities \n\nand, finally, third-generation MOFs contain biomolecules such as cations, drugs, bioactive \n\ncompounds, toxins and gases within their framework.35 \n\nMOFs can also differ for the characteristic framework they possess. In this sense, they can be \n\ncategorized into two groups, rigid and flexible. A permanent porosity and robust pores characterize \n\nthe first type. The second one is dynamic and responds to external factors such as temperature, \n\npressure or even guest molecules. \n\nThe broad range of MOFs published through the years is huge and it results impossible to \n\npresent all of them. The following text discusses about MOF-5, one of the principal metal-organic \n\nframeworks. \n\n \n\n1. 3.2 The father of MOFs- MOF-5 and its application \n\n \n\nThis paragraph is dedicated to the description of MOF-5 developed in 1999 by Yaghi and co-\n\nworkers.29 \n\nIt is also called IRMOF-1 standing for isoreticular and means a series of MOFs with the same \n\ntopology, but different size of pores. MOF-5 is a metal-organic framework formed from tetranuclear \n\nsupertetrahedral cluster consisting of Zn4O that constitutes the nodes separated by 1,4-\n\nbenzodicarboxylic (BDC) acid struts.29 More specifically the structure derived from a simple cubic \n\nsix-connected net in two stages: first, the nodes (vertices) of the net are replaced by clusters of \n\nsecondary building units; second, the links (edges) of the net are replaced by finite rods (`struts') of \n\njavascript:Jmol.controls._click(null,30);\n\n\n \n\n \n\n13 Part 1. Introduction \n\nBDC molecules. The core of the cluster consists of a single O atom bonded to four Zn atoms, \n\nforming a regular Zn4O tetrahedron. Each edge of each Zn tetrahedron is then capped by a CO2 \n\ngroup to form a Zn4(O)(CO2)6 cluster. \n Figure 9b shows the sphere that represents the pore size \n\nthat can be used for gas storage.  \n\nThe structure was obtained by a solvothermal method in mild conditions. That means a solution \n\nof the metal precursor (Zinc II Nitrate) in trimethylamine was mixed with a solution of H2BDC in \n\nN,N\u2019-dimethylformamide (DMF)/chlorobenzene. The solid-state 13C NMR analysis of the obtained \n\ncolourless crystal blocks confirmed the inclusion of DMF and chlorobenzene molecules in the \n\nvoids. This stability was confirmed after heating up to 300\u00b0C for 24h the desolvated crystals. \n\nIncredibly, both the morphology and the crystallinity remained unaltered as the single crystal X-ray \n\nanalysis confirmed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - MOF-5 crystal relative packing36 (a) and the void dimension (b).37 \n\n \n\nWithout considering the guest molecules in the voids, the 80% of the cell volume stayed \n\nunoccupied. This characteristic indicates the high surface to volume ratio (surface/volume) \n\nreached.  \n\nb) a) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n14 Part 1. Introduction \n\nThis incredible success derived from the commitment between organic and inorganic chemistry \n\nand traced the starting point of the research and development of several MOFs.  \n\n \n\n1. 4.1 An introduction to halogen bond \n\n \n\nPorous materials constructed from molecular building blocks, such as MOFs, have received \n\ncontinuous interest for not only their diverse and designable structures but also for their dynamic \n\nbehaviors under external stimuli.38 Supramolecular organic frameworks that are acquiring more \n\nand more attention due to their easy synthesis represent a relatively new class of porous materials. \n\nAmong the wide range of these molecular materials, the last decade has seen the rise of the \n\nhalogen organic frameworks. As the name suggests, the structures are built up on motifs that self-\n\norganize through the halogen bond recognition. Indeed, as halogen atoms in organic compounds \n\ncan typically be found at the periphery of molecules, they are ideally positioned to be involved in \n\nintermolecular interactions.39 This noncovalent interaction is less familiar than hydrogen bond but it \n\nis similar to it in several respects.40 \n\nIt results, thus, important to clarify what halogen bond is. Any noncovalent intermolecular \n\narrangement R \u2013 X\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Y, where X is the halogen atom, is included in the definition41 of halogen bond \n\n(Fig. 10). This peculiar interaction exists when an electron density transfer occurs from the electron \n\ndonor site, Lewis base, to the halogen atom, Lewis acid.42 The attractive nature of the interaction \n\nresults in intermolecular distances shorter than the sum of the van der Waals (vdW) radii of the \n\ninvolved atoms. The characteristics of these noncovalent interactions depend on the nature of the \n\ninteracting partners that determine the final architecture of a supramolecular system. The nature of \n\nthe halogen bond donors and acceptors influence the final architecture in a supramolecular \n\nsystem. Molecules possessing nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur atoms are good XB acceptors.  \n\nOn the other hand, the XB donors are characterized by a halogen atom high polarizable and \n\nless electronegative. They are involved in a covalent bond with an atom quite electronegative, such \n\nas nitrogen, which withdraws the electron density intensifying the electropositive area on the \n\nhalogen alongside the bond. However, generally the halogen bond donor ability decreases in the \n\norder I > Br > Cl.43 Fluorine is not even considered because of its weakness in forming XBs. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n15 Part 1. Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Schematic representation of halogen bonding interaction.44 \n\n \n\n \n\nHalogen bond occurs due to an anisotropic distribution of the electron density around the \n\nhalogen atom. This anisotropic character determines the formation of a region of positive \n\nelectrostatic potential on the outermost portion of some covalently bound halogen atoms.45 The \n\nelectron density is represented by an ellipsoid elongated in the direction of the bonding axis, a \n\nfeature called polar flattening.46 Consequently, the XB is a high directional type of bond. Regarding \n\ncrystal engineering, this feature is exploited to tailor the design of new porous materials useful for \n\ngas storage and for the adsorption of volatile organic compounds,47 drug delivery systems,48 fuel \n\ncells, ion exchange and CO2 capture.  \n\nHalogen bonding is mainly explored in co-crystals between iodine perfluorocarbons and \n\nnitrogen-containing compounds,46 but the discovery of porous molecular crystals from a mixture of \n\nhexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) has broadened the non-fluorine \n\nbased halogen bond donors to N-haloimides.49 \n\nThe present project deals with the design and formation of crystals of which motif is built up \n\nthrough XBs. For this reason, it is of great importance to clarify, as far as possible, some main \n\nfeatures of this noncovalent interaction starting from the historical background that led to the \n\ndiscovery of this new class of supramolecular bonds. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n16 Part 1. Introduction \n\n1. 4.2 A historical background \n\n \n\nThe history of the halogen bonding (XB) is approximately 200 years old as the I2???NH3 adduct, \n\nprobably the first halogen-bonded system ever prepared, was synthesized in Gay-Lussac\u2019s \n\nlaboratory by Colin as early as 1813 (Fig. 11).50 Colin reported that when dry gaseous ammonia \n\nand dry iodine are reacted, a liquid with a somewhat metallic luster is produced. Fifty years later, \n\nGuthrie obtained the same liquid in pure form by adding powdered iodine to aqueous ammonia and \n\nproposing the compound structure as I2???NH3 . \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Frontispiece of the volume (left) and the first page of the paper (right) where Colin was \nreporting his experiments on the reaction of diiodine with ammonia.50 \n\n \n\n \n\nJust after 1950, the chemistry community started to figure out the existence of a strong \n\nelectrophilic nature of halogens. Until that time, the recognition of electrophilic halogens as \n\nresponsible for the formation of relatively strong and directional interactions in the solid, liquid, and \n\ngas phases was denied by the entire community.50 In 1954 Hassel et al.51 described the solid-state \n\nstructure of the Br2???O(CH2CH2)2O system (Fig. 12, top). In 1958 and 1959 two more structures \n\nwere reported, Br2???C6H6 (Fig. 12, bottom) and Cl2???C6H6 adducts,\n50 showing that ?-systems work \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n17 Part 1. Introduction \n\nas donors of electron density to the electrophilic halogens even in the solid state. The use of \n\n\u2018\u2019halogen bond\u2019\u2019 to identify this interaction progressively became less and less occasional, and an \n\nexponential growth occurred in the last 20 years in parallel with the comprehensive process of \n\nunification of all phenomena related to interactions originated by electrophilic halogens. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Ball and stick representation of infinite chains formed by dibromine with 1,4-dioxane (a) \nand benzene (b).

Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity.50 \n\n \n\n1. 4.3 A physical study of halogen bonds: the ?-hole \n\n \n\nThe formation of chemical bonds, wherever they may fall on the continuum between covalent \n\nand noncovalent, involves a balancing of attractive and repulsive forces within the system. Once at \n\nequilibrium, the forces felt by the nucleus are zero. These forces have a nature purely Coulombic. \n\nIn a molecule, nuclei with electrons exercise a potential, which can be defined as: \n\n \n\nV(r) = ? (ZA / |RA - r|) - ? (?(r \u2018)dr \u2018/ |r \u2018 - r|)       eq.1 \n\n \n\nWhere ZA is the charge on nucleus A, located at RA. The denominators are the distances from \n\neach nucleus A and each unit of electronic charge ?(r \u2019)dr from the point of interest r.52 \n\nWhen there is no perturbing effect, the electron density ?(r) is static, and the corresponding \n\npotential is defined as electrostatic potential. The electrostatic potential is a property of \n\nfundamental significance53 and it is useful in predicting noncovalent interactions areas with positive \n\nb) \n\na) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n18 Part 1. Introduction \n\nV(r) of a molecule that attracts areas of negative V(r) of another molecule. Generally, the literature \n\nrefers to surface VS(r) as the potential is computed on the surface of the molecule. The latter is \n\ndefined by the 0.001 au contour of its ?(r).54 When the electrostatic potential is positive is indicated \n\nas Vs,max and where is negative it is labeled Vs,min. \n\nOnce the concept of electrostatic potential is clarified the comprehension of the ?-hole, a basic \n\nconcept in halogen bonds, results easier. \n\nConsidering a simple free halogen atom, it presents an overall electron density distribution with \n\na spherical symmetry and a positive potential.55 When the same atom forms a covalent bond with \n\nan atom B, the spherical symmetry is disrupted, and the electron density undergoes to an \n\nanisotropic distribution. More specifically the electron density would be less along the extension of \n\nthe bond than on the lateral sides. The area with less electron density is called \u201c?-hole\u201d. The name \n\nis due to the electron-deficient outer portion of the half-filled bonding orbital.56 The presence of the \n\n?-hole causes the electrostatic potential VS(r) on the surface of the covalent bond to assume \n\ndifferent signs. In fact, what is often found is that VS(r) is positive in the ?-hole region, which has \n\nthe lesser electronic density, and it is negative on the lateral sides, which possess greater \n\nelectronic densities.52 Figure 13 shows the computational calculation of the Vs(r), performed with \n\nDFT methods, in chlorine when forming the covalent bond in Cl-OH. As it is possible to observe, \n\nthe positive potential indicated with the red color corresponds to the ?-hole along the O\u2013Cl bond.  \n\nIn general, the more polarizable the halogen atom and the more electron attracting the skeleton \n\nof the molecule, the more positive is the halogen ?-hole. Thus, the XB-donor ability is greater for \n\nthe heavier and more polarizable halogens. It increases according to the order Cl<Br<I. The \n\nfluorine atom, even if it belongs to the VII group of the periodic table, it is so electronegative that it \n\nis not common to behave as an XB donor as it does not possess an extensive ?-hole. Just in \n\ncases where the electron donor is highly strong, fluorine shows a ?-hole interaction.57 The \n\npresence of a ?-hole on many covalently bound halogen atoms gives rise to attractive noncovalent \n\ninteractions, both inter- and intramolecular, with negative sites such as the lone pairs of Lewis \n\nbases, ? electrons, anions, etc.55 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n19 Part 1. Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 DFT calculations of the electrostatic potential on the molecular surface of Cl-OH. \nChlorine is on the left.

The most positive potential on the chlorine \nsurface (red) has a VS,max of 0.99 V, and corresponds to a ?-hole on the extension of the O\u2013Cl \nbond. Note also the positive region associated with the hydrogen (lower right); the VS,max is 2.51 \nV.55 \n\n \n\nThese interactions result high directional. Indeed, if a halogen atom X is covalently bound with \n\nan atom R, the resulting interaction with either a nucleophilic or an electrophilic site will be along \n\nthe covalent bond (linear) in the first case, and on the lateral side in the second case (Fig. 14). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nR X Nucleophile\n-\n\n \n\n \n \n\nR X\n\nElectrophile\n+\n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Schematic representation of the directional interaction between covalently bound \nhalogen atoms with nucleophilic (a) and electrophilic (b) moieties. \n\n \n\n \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n20 Part 1. Introduction \n\nThe more linear the X???Nucleophile bond is, the stronger the interaction results. This means \n\nthat the distance between the two atoms is shorter. Therefore, the length and the linearity of the \n\nbond indicate how strong the interaction is. \n\nNow the question is what is the real, physical nature of this interaction? What is the nature, so, \n\nof the ?-holes? Through the literature, the interaction with this positive area in molecules covalently \n\nbound is justified by several concepts: charge transfer, dispersion forces, polarization, electrostatic \n\nforces, etc. Nevertheless, the meaning of all these models is overlapping, and a great confusion \n\ncan derived. Indeed, they represent just a dissection of one and unique measurable property, so \n\nexperimentally measurable, the interaction energy ?E between two components A and B given by: \n\n \n\n?E = E(AB) \u2013 [E(A) + E(B)]                eq.2 \n\n \n\nWhere E(AB) is the energy of the complex AB, and E(A) and E(B) are the energies of the isolated \n\ncomponents. This energy is a consequence of the action of the Coulombic forces that encompass \n\nall the forces listed before. Thus, whatever is the cause of the ?-holes interactions, their nature is a \n\nconsequence of the action of the Coulombic forces \n\n \n\n1. 4.4 Donor Molecules in Halogen bond systems \n\n \n\nControlling the arrangement of small molecules in crystalline solids remains a challenge for \n\nmaterials chemistry.58 More specifically, the importance of establishing a ranking of moieties with \n\nsimilar chemical behaviour has a fundamental role in supramolecular chemistry, where a detailed \n\nknowledge of intermolecular interactions, is crucial for the rational preparation of a material with \n\ndesired structure and properties.59 Supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ? \n\nstacking represent the most common noncovalent tools in designing novel crystalline architectures. \n\nContrary, halogen bonds have just recently gained the attention as potential guides for the \n\nformation of crystals with specific structures. As already observed, a halogen bonding involves an \n\nelectron-deficient halogen atom and an electron-donating group.60 Almost any electronegative \n\nmolecule can act as XB acceptor.61 For example, the nitrogen atoms of the tetracoordinated \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n21 Part 1. Introduction \n\nhexamethylenetetramine molecule are good XB acceptor sites.49,62 Anions are considered to be \n\nbetter halogen-bond acceptors than neutral species.63 Even cyanometallates have been employed \n\nfor obtaining strong halogen interactions.64 \n\nA key role for the formation of this new type of noncovalent interaction is played by the XB \n\ndonor molecules. Their performance depends on the ability of the halogen atom to be polarized, as \n\nwell as on the presence of electron-withdrawing moieties that enhance the anisotropy of the \n\nelectron distribution on the adjacent halogen atom.59 \n\nAccording to this information, it is possible to trace a ranking for the XB donor moieties ability \n\nfollowing two main guidelines:  \n\na) The power of the XB donor moiety decreases in the order I>Br>Cl>>F.57 \n\nb) The greater the electron-withdrawing ability of the backbone of the XB donor molecule is, the \n\nmore effective the XB donor moiety is expected to be. \n\nAaker\u00f6y et al.59 attempted to rank the interacting preference of chemical moieties by examining \n\nsix XB donors, carrying different electron withdrawal groups, and their ability to form halogen \n\nbonds. The donors molecules are reported in Figure 15 with the correspondent values of the VS,MAX \n\ncalculated on the surface of the halogen atoms through DFT calculations. Halogens with weak \n\nelectron withdrawal moieties displayed low electrostatic potential\u2019 values. So a first theoretical \n\nranking of XB donor molecules strength was delineated. In order to confirm this hierarchy, the \n\nmolecules were combined with several XB acceptors to obtain co-crystals. As expected, just the \n\nstrongest XB donor molecules were able to interact through XBs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 - From left to right: the six XB donor molecules in order of decreasing electrostatic \npotential, associated with the most positive ?-hole among the halogen atoms in these molecules. \nMaximum values associated with each XB donor are reported near the corresponding atom. \nValues are in kJ/mol. Calculation performed through DFT method.59 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n22 Part 1. Introduction \n\nGenerally, perfluorohalocarbons (PFHCs) are considered strong halogen bonds donors.63 \n\nResnati and Metrangolo described the first case of perfluorocarbon \u2013 halocarbon (PFC-HC) self-\n\nassembly to give co-crystals through interactions between nitrogen as a donor (Lewis base) and \n\niodine as an acceptor (Lewis acid).65 \n\nOne more class of possible XB donors is represented by the N-halosuccinamides. This type of \n\ninteraction is recognizable in the crystal structure of N-chlorosuccinamide between the chlorine \n\natoms and the carbonyl oxygens.66 Rissanen and co-workers49,62 have already employed N-\n\nbromosuccinamide and N-iodosuccinamide obtaining robust supramelocular architectures. \n\nThis paragraph gives an overview of several XB donor molecules applied for the assembly of \n\nnovel structures. In this perspective, even if difficult to define, a hierarchy among the several XB \n\ndonor molecules is fundamental in the supramolecular synthesis of complex architectures.  \n\n \n\n1. 4.5 Halogen bond versus Hydrogen bond \n\n \n\nAccording to the IUPAC definition, the hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a \n\nhydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment R-H in which R is more electronegative \n\nthan H, and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is \n\nevidence of bond formation.67 Generally, the formation of a hydrogen bond is indicated by the \n\nscheme R-H???Y. As the XB, even in this case the linearity and the distance from the Y atom are \n\nindicators of the bond strength. The closer the angle is to 180\u00b0, the shorter is the H???Y distance \n\nand, so, the stronger is the hydrogen bond.  \n\nThis type of noncovalent interaction shows lots in common with the XB. In fact, by a \n\ncomputational analysis of the hydrogen atom covalently bound to other more electronegative \n\natoms, it is possible to observe the existence of the ?-hole. Since a hydrogen atom has only one \n\nvalence electron that is participating in the R-H bond, the outer portion of the hydrogen has a \n\npositive potential with its maximum along the extension of the R-H bond (?-hole).55 Nonetheless, \n\nthe lack of any other valence electron on the hydrogen makes its lateral sides to possess a low \n\nelectron density. Therefore, hydrogen ?-holes are more hemispherical as shown in figures 13 and \n\n16. The hydrogen bonds tend to be not as directional as other ?-hole interactions. This difference \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n23 Part 1. Introduction \n\nis one of the main from the halogen bonding but not the only one. Indeed, halogenated organic \n\nfragments are not readily miscible in aqueous or polar solvents resulting hydrophobic. In particular, \n\nit has been demonstrated that polar solvents, such as water, have little influence on the interaction \n\nenergies and geometries of halogen-bonded adducts in solution.56 In the case of hydrogen-bonded \n\nadducts, the competition with hydrogen bond-donor/acceptor solvents influences their formation. It \n\nis possible to define the halogen bonding as the hydrophobic equivalent of the hydrophilic \n\nhydrogen bonding.68 This feature can be exploited in drug design and, so, control the lipophilicity of \n\nthe drugs for absorption, biological barrier permeability, transport into organs and cells, and \n\ninteraction with target molecules.69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16 \u2013 DFT calculations of the electrostatic potential on the molecular surface of HI. The \nhydrogen is on the right. The positions of the nuclei are indicated by the light circles. Color ranges, \nin volts: red, greater than 0.43; green, between 0.43 and 0; blue, less than 0 (negative).55 \n\n \n\nAs hydrogen bonds show some differences with the halogen bonds, what happens if they \n\nparticipate together in the assembly of a supramolecular structure? Do they compete or perform a \n\ncomplemental work? These questions are fundamental to predict which will be the primary \n\ninteraction in a supramolecular system.70 In the work of Aaker\u00f6y et al.70 a wide range of ditopic \n\nmolecules carrying both a hydrogen and a halogen bond donor (Fig. 17a) were combined with \n\nthree types of acceptors, monotopic, ditopic symmetric and ditopic asymmetric molecules (Fig. \n\n17b). After co-crystallization, three different plots were obtained. In Figure 18 the diagrams show \n\nthe preference of interaction in the co-crystallization with the monotopic, ditopic symmetric and \n\nditopic asymmetric acceptor molecules. In the case of monotopic the main supramolecular \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n24 Part 1. Introduction \n\ninteraction is of hydrogen type. Just in a small amount of motifs both XB and HB, contribute for \n\ntheir formation.

From a research point of view, especially when creating a new material, scientists want \n\nto remove as many variables as possible to understand the properties of the materials. To obtain \n\nthis, materials have to be studied as pure as possible, and here it comes clear the importance of \n\nsingle crystals where impurities and defects have been radically reduced.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n27 Part 1.

In single crystals, a long-range order of atoms exists. In the case of polycrystalline \n\nmaterials, defined regions with their own order of atoms coexist. Regarding amorphous materials, \n\nno order can be found. \n\nThus, single crystals play a decisive role not only in the context of complex materials research. \n\nSingle-crystal X-ray structural analysis still represents the definitive proof of a structure for the \n\nchemists. The discussion of molecular and other properties depends upon it, especially for a \n\ncomparison with structures calculated from quantum chemistry.74 \n\n \n\n1. 5.2 Crystal Parameters \n \n\nAs a crystal is a solid where a pattern is repeated over the three dimensions, it is necessary just \n\nto know its motif to describe the entire structure. The motif can be converted by symmetry \n\noperations along three spatial vectors a, b, c, forming, thus, a lattice. The smallest unit volume of \n\nthat is called the unit cell. It is described by the three lattice constants a, b and c (length of the \n\nbasis vectors) and the angles formed by them ?, ? and ? (Fig. 21). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na c b \n\na) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n28 Part 1.

Introduction \n\nThe unit cell has to be chosen in such a way that the highest number of symmetries is \n\ndescribed. Sometimes just the seven crystal systems are enough for that description. They are \n\nalso called primitive cells, indicated by the P letter, to be distinguished from the centred ones. The \n\nlatter are used when better describe the symmetry of a crystal even if this implies the consideration \n\nof more lattice points. Centred cells are indicated by letters I (body-centred), A, B, C (based-\n\ncentred), and F (face-centred). Thus, the lattice systems used to describe crystals are 14, \n\nrecognized as the 14 Bravais Lattices (Fig. 22).72  \n\nIn the atomic lattice of a crystal it is possible to recognize the existence of parallel planes \n\nformed by the lattice points. The orientation of such planes is defined by the Miller indices with the \n\nvalues h, k, and l. These can be determined by recognizing the plane that lies nearest to the origin \n\nof the unit cell. Thus, the reciprocal of the intercepts between the plane and the axis of the unit cell, \n\na, b and c, correspond to the h, k and l values and they are always integers.  \n\nOnce presented the parameters of the base structure of a crystal, the section continues \n\nshowing some important topics of crystallography. These are presented roughly, as the main \n\nobject of the entire project was the development of novel nanoporous materials.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 - Representation of the 14 Bravais lattices.76 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n30 Part 1. Introduction \n\n1. 5.3 X-Ray diffraction  \n\n \n\nCrystallography finds its origin on the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen who \n\nreceived the Nobel Prize in physics at 1901.  \n\nX radiations are emitted when the electrons change the energy state. Generally, X-rays have a \n\nwavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nm of the electromagnetic spectrum, resulting highly energetic \n\nand penetrating radiations. For this reason, they are good for interacting at the atomic level, \n\npenetrating the lattice planes of a crystal.  \n\nAfter their discovery, different scientists contributed for the evolution of crystallography. Max von \n\nLaue managed to produce a diffraction pattern investigating the interaction between X-Rays and \n\ncrystals. He found that crystals are composed by periodic arrays of atoms (Fig. 23), and cause X-\n\nRays diffraction patterns due to the atoms and their 3-dimensional spacing. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23 \u2013 Laue model of the diffraction by a row of atoms.77 \n\n \n\nOne of the major contributions came with Bragg family, father and son, who, based on the work \n\nof Laue, formulated the relationship between crystal\u2019s atomic structure and its X-Ray diffraction \n\nproviding a tool which has revolutionized our understanding of matter.72 \n\n \n\nn? = 2dhkl (sin?)     (n=1, 2, 3,\u2026)          Bragg\u2019s Law     eq. 3 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n31 Part 1. Introduction \n\nWhere ? is the wavelength, dhkl is the spacing between atomic planes and ? is the angle between \n\nthe incident rays and the surface of the crystals. Figure 24 shows the mechanism that brought to \n\nthe formulation of this law. When a beam of X-rays irradiated a substance, the X-ray reflected from \n\nthe surface of that substance has less traveled than one that is reflected from the atomic planes in \n\nthe bulk. This means that the two waves have a difference in their reflection path. This difference is \n\nrelated to the planes distance, dhkl, and the angle at which the X-ray penetrates into the material. \n\nThe two waves are in phase if the one reflected from the atomic layers has traveled a whole \n\nnumber of wavelengths while inside the material. Thus when n is an integer, the reflected waves \n\nfrom different atomic planes are in phase, and a constructive interference is produced. In case n is \n\nnot an integer, destructive interference occurs, and no diffraction pattern is produced.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24 - Bragg\u2019s Law representation: the path length difference between X-rays hitting parallel \natomic planes has to be a multiple of their wavelength.76 \n\n \n\nIn order to analyse crystals, X-ray diffractometers are fundamental. They consist of three basic \n\nelements, an X-ray tube, a sample holder, and an X-ray detector.75 In the cathode tube, X-rays are \n\nproduced by the impact of electrons on a target. The electrons are formed after heating a filament \n\nand applying a voltage that accelerates them to the target. Electrons with enough energy can rip \n\nelectrons of inner shells of the target, and, so, X-rays spectra are produced (Fig.25).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n32 Part 1. Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25 - X-ray production through quantum phenomena explanation.78 \n\n \n\nMany electronic transitions occur in the atoms when the target is stricken so that many \n\nwavelengths are produced from the atomic shells. Consequently, in the spectra, several \n\ncomponents will be present. As the K? radiations (from the K? shell) are the most energetic, in \n\norder to obtain the right diffraction intensities, some filters are applied such as foils or crystals \n\nmonochrometers that absorb the wavelengths less energetic than K?. The most common targets \n\nused for the production of X-rays are Molybdenum and Copper. The K? radiations produced by \n\nMolybdenum and Copper have wavelengths of 0.7107\u00c5 and 0.15406 \u00c5 respectively. Once \n\nproduced, X-rays are directed to the sample. When the geometry of the incident X-rays against the \n\nsample satisfies the Bragg Equation, constructive interference occurs. The detector collects the \n\nsignal of the diffracted X-rays, converts it into a count rate and sends it to a device such as a \n\ncomputer monitor. \n\nBoth powder X-ray diffractometers and single crystal X-ray diffractometers have similar \n\ninstrumentation. Nevertheless, in the single crystal case, the diffractometers use either 3- or 4-\n\ncircle goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (?, ?, ?, and ?) that define the \n\nrelationship between the crystal lattice, the incident ray and the detector.75 Samples are mounted \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n33 Part 1. Introduction \n\non thin glass fibers that are attached to brass pins and mounted onto goniometer heads. \n\nAdjustment of the x, y and z orthogonal directions allows the centering of the crystal within the X-\n\nray beam (Fig. 26). \n\nWhen radiation hits the single crystal, three following phenomena occur: transmission, \n\nreflection, and diffraction. A beam stopper blocks the transmitted radiations to avoid the burning of \n\nthe detector. The detector due to the angles involved does not pick up the reflected rays. Just the \n\ndiffracted rays are collected. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 26 - Schematic representation of single crystal X-ray diffractometer.75 \n\n \n\n1. 5.4 Single crystal growth \n\n \n\nThe goal in growing crystals for a single crystal X-ray diffraction experiment is to grow single \n\ncrystals of suitable size. The optimum size for a crystal is one that has dimensions of 0.2 - 0.4 mm \n\nin at least two of the three dimensions.  \n\nCrystals and single crystals are obtained depending on the relative rate of nucleation and \n\ngrowth. A fast nucleation means really small crystals or agglomerates. On the other hand, fast rate \n\nof growth implies the inclusion of defects in the crystal structure. The right compromise for a \n\nperfect single crystal has not been discovered. Anyway, different crystallization methods have \n\nbeen developed. \n\nMost of the single crystals are obtained from solution. When a solution is oversaturated the \n\ncrystal precipitates out. There are numerous factors during crystal growth, which affect both the \n\nsize and the quality of the crystal. The most important are purity of compounds, crystallization \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n34 Part 1. Introduction \n\nsolvent, number of nucleation sites, mechanical agitation applied to the system, and time.79 Several \n\ntechniques of crystal growth from solution exist. Herein, just some of them are presented. \n\nSlow evaporation (Fig. 27a) is the simplest one and consists of the preparation of a suitable \n\nsolution with the desired compounds. This is left in a clean container, with a large surface and not \n\ntightly covered to favour solvent evaporation. To avoid a fast nucleation, the sample is subjected to \n\nthe less disturb as possible. The performance of this technique is easy but the probability to obtain \n\nsmall crystallites or agglomerates is high as the oversaturation point is rapidly reached. \n\nVapour diffusion (Fig. 27b) is a method that needs a binary system of solvents. Both solvents \n\nhave to be miscible one to each other, but with different boiling points. The one with the higher \n\nboiling point is called solvent, and that with a lower boiling point is called precipitant. The \n\ncompound has to be dissolved in the solvent. After transferring the mixture in a vial, this is put in a \n\ncontainer with the precipitant, and sealed. Over the time, the precipitant, which is more volatile, will \n\ndiffuse over the gas phase into the solvent, leading to oversaturation, nucleation and, if all goes \n\nwell, finally crystallization.79 \n\nLiquid-liquid diffusion (Fig. 27c) even in this technique a binary solvent system is necessary. \n\nDifferently, from the previous method, the two solvents have different densities. Once the solution \n\nwith the proper compound is ready, the second solvent with a different density is gently poured \n\nover that with a syringe to avoid the immediate mixture of the two liquids. Over the time, the \n\nsolvents will mix and crystals will be formed. \n\nFinally, in slow cooling method (Fig. 27d) a nearly saturated solution of the compound or close \n\nto the boiling point of the solvent is prepared. Afterwards, it is transferred to a clean container and \n\ncovered. This is placed in a heat bath at about the same temperature and left to cool down slowly. \n\nThe above-listed methods single crystals growth are all from solution. It is possible to obtain single \n\ncrystals both from melt solutions and from gas phases75 but for the present project, they were not \n\ntaken into consideration and, thus, they are not explained.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n35 Part 1.

This tetradentate base has been exploited in previous works combined with Ag(I) salts \n\nin order to produce supertetrahedral networks with large interstitial cavities.80 \n\nOn this purpose, the first goal was to examine the affection of XBs on the crystal packing by \n\nchanging the XB donor molecules. Based on the past works of Raatikainen et al,49,62 the first \n\nmolecules used as XB donors were NCS, NBS, and NIS. We probed the nucleophilicity of nitrogen \n\natoms on HMTA molecule even with molecular iodine and iodopentafluorobenzene molecule. One \n\nmore object was to verify the existence of easier ways to obtain the tetracoordinated complex. \n\nAccording to the mechanochemistry\u2019 rules,81 we combined N-halosuccinamide with one more \n\nmolecule acting as less active XB donor or as stronger XB donor. \n\nThe strength of the interactions between the halogen and the electronegative atoms of the XB \n\nacceptor were measured by considering their distance normalized according to the van der Waals \n\nradii through the formula: \n\na) \n\nd) c) \n\nb) \n\nT?Teb Troom \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n36 Part 1.

Even if the real influence \n\nof the solvents on the halogen bonds is not still stated, it has been deduced83 that complexation \n\nthrough halogen bonds recognition occurs in apolar and aprotic polar solvents. According to this \n\nconsideration, we used apolar and aprotic polar solvents to verify the minimum competition \n\nbetween halogen and hydrogen interactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n37 Part 2.

Results and discussion \n\n3.     Results and discussion \n\n \n\n3.1 Structure (HMTACH2OH)\n+Cl- \n\n \n\nThe addition of a solution of NCS in chloroform to a solution of HMTA in ACN led to the \n\nformation of a salt, Scheme 1. \n\nNCS is used for chlorinations and as a mild oxidant. In fact, it is known to be a good chlorine \n\nprovider in radical reactions. On the other hand, the high electronegativity that characterizes the \n\nchlorine atom makes NCS belonging to the category of weak XB donors. Indeed, it is stated that \n\nhalogens and derivatives work as XB donors, and the tendency to form strong interactions is I > Br \n\n> Cl >> F.90 For equal electron withdrawal moieties, compared to NBS and NIS, it is less \n\npolarizable, and its ?-hole potential is less electropositive. Thus, it is less prominent on interacting \n\nas XB donor. \n\nThe chlorine anion that forms the salt with the HMTA molecule is provided both from the N-\n\nhalosuccinamide and from the chloroform. The low polarity of chlorine does not favour XB \n\nformation, and as expected, none of the XB interactions is present in the final crystal structure. \n\n \n\n3.2 Structure (HMTA) \u2022Br2 \n\n \n\nInitially, the HMTA molecule was mixed with NIS in one to four ratios from ACN solution. White \n\npowder precipitates were obtained. The fast reaction between the halogen atoms and the \n\nnucleophilic sites of HMTA prevented the arrangement of the synthons through hydrogen \n\ninteractions. The saturated solution precipitated, and white solids appeared. \n\nThe substitution of the aprotic polar solvent ACN with others such as acetone, nitromethane, \n\nDCM, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, and toluene, either gave white precipitates or decomposed \n\nproducts. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidant\n\n\n \n\n \n\n49 Part 3. Results and discussion \n\nPassing from NIS to NBS, less strong as XB donor, colourless crystals formation occurred. The \n\ncrystallographic structure analysis revealed they consisted of (HMTA)\u2022Br2 complexes.  \n\nThe nitrogen atom of the Lewis base interacts through XB with the molecular bromine. This \n\nlatter is the result of radical\u2019s reactions to which NBS molecule undergoes. After the cleavage of \n\nthe covalent bond between the nitrogen and the bromine in the NBS molecule, free bromine \n\nradicals reacted together to form the correspondent molecular form.  \n\nDihalogens can act as XB donors and, so, tend to form short contact interactions with the \n\nrelative acceptor molecules. Indeed the distance between the positively charged bromine and the \n\nmost nucleophilic nitrogen of HMTA results 2.088 \u00c5, 38.8% less than the sum of their vdW radii.91 \n\nThe short and strong XB induces an elongation of the covalently bound bromines (Fig. 28a and b). \n\nFurthermore, the high strength of the XB is reflected by its high directionality. The angle formed \n\nbetween the nitrogen atom and the bromines is almost linear (175.25\u00b0).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28 -  A view of the structure (HMTA)\u2022(Br)2 with the distances of the halogen bonds (a), the \nrelative CPK representation (b) and the crystal packing along the a-axis (c) and the b-axis (d). \n\n \n\nThe crystal structure analysis revealed that crystal packing is caused by hydrogen bonding \n\nforces. The nucleophilic bromine of the dihalogen alongside its electron density cloud interacts with \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n50 Part 3. Results and discussion \n\nthe \u2013C-H moieties of adjacent HMTA molecules. Parallel, the free nitrogens in HMTA molecules \n\n(not participating on XBs\u2019 formation) exercise their electron withdrawal action to the \u2013CH groups of \n\nadjacent HMTA molecules (Fig. 28c and d). \n\nEven if the XB acceptor molecule, HMTA, is tetrafunctional, in terms of energy (HMTA)\u2022Br2 \n\nadducts are more stable.  \n\n \n\n3.3 Structure (HMTA)\u20222(C6F5I) \n\n \n\nThe trials performed with HMTA and NBS gave a complex where a molecular bromine interacts \n\njust with one nitrogen atom of HMTA. In a first step, thus, the attention of the work was turned to \n\nthe analysis of the nucleophilicity of the Lewis base. \n\nIn this perspective, new XB donors were used to test HMTA nucleophilicity. Generally, strongly \n\nelectronegative perfluoroalkyl residues further enhance the Lewis acid character (electron \n\naccepting ability) of halogen atoms in perfluorocarbon halides.92 This fact led to choose \n\niodopentafluorobenzene (C6F5I) and make it react with the tetrafunctional HMTA. Its benzene ring \n\nwithdraws the electron density cloud of the iodine atom, and the electropositive ?-hole is \n\nintensified. As some studies reveal, the presence of fluorine atoms increases both the magnitude \n\nand the size of the ?-hole on iodine.93 \n\nFigures 29a and b show the dimers formed through XB interactions between the Iodine atoms \n\nand two of the four nitrogen atoms. Both contacts are short with R1=21.5% and R2=20.7% less \n\nthan the sum of the vdW radii of the iodine and nitrogen atoms.91 As shown, the distances of the \n\ntwo moieties are different meaning that one bonding is formed before the second one. This fact \n\nrelies on the polarizability of the nitrogen atoms. The first nucleophile site is enough polarized to \n\nform a short contact distance with the iodine. Although less electronegative, the second nitrogen is \n\nagain enough polarized to create a new bond with the other iodine but less strong than the first \n\none. The resulting contact lengths are different. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n51 Part 3.

Neither NBS nor NCS participated in the \n\ncomplexation of the structure. The chlorine atom provided by the NCS is attached to the bromine \n\natom from the NBS molecule.  \n\nThe bromine atoms interact with two nitrogen atoms on HMTA molecule. The intensified \n\nelectropositive potential of bromine comes from the withdrawal effect of the electronegative \n\nchlorine atom. Generally, in dihalogen molecules, the activation of the halogen participating in a \n\nhalogen bond increases with the decreasing atomic number of the second halogen.93 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 31 - A view of the structure (HMTA)\u20222(BrCl) with the distances between bromine and \nnitrogen atoms (a), the relative CPK representation (b) and the packing of the crystal structure (c). \n\n \n\nBoth contact distances are short (2.166 \u00c5 and 2.145 \u00c5), 36.29% and 36.91% less than the sum \n\nof the vdW91 radii.

These interlink one with another through hydrogen \n\nbonds between C-H groups of HMTA and the free nitrogen atoms in adjacent HMTA molecules \n\n(Fig. 31c). \n\n \n\n3.6 Structure (HMTA)\u20222(ICl) \n\n \n\nIn the prospective to obtain the final crystalline structure of (HMTA)\u20224(NIS), HMTA, NIS and \n\nNCS were combined together.

Results and discussion \n\nAs most of the previous complexes, the different length between both distances indicated the \n\nfact they are not formed simultaneously. The nitrogen atom exercises a withdrawal action on the \n\niodine causing the elongation of the covalent bond with the chlorine.  \n\nIn the crystal packing (Fig. 32c), the motifs interlink and stack in chains through hydrogen bonds \n\nbetween the -CH moieties, the nitrogens, and the chlorines of adjacent XB acceptor molecules. \n\n \n\n3.7 Structure (HMTA)\u20222(NBP) \n\n \n\nN-bromophthalimide (NBP) molecule possesses an intensified electropositive potential along \n\nthe covalent bond N-Br due to the higher withdrawal effect of the benzene ring.  \n\nThe dropwise addition of NBP solution to the HMTA led to the precipitation of colourless \n\ncrystalline blocks from a non-homogeneous solution, with a crystal structure belonging to the \n\northorhombic space group Pmn21 (Fig. 33).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 33 - A view of the structure (HMTA)\u20222(NBP) with the distances between the bromine and \nthe two nucleophilic sites of HMTA (a), the relative CPK representation (b) and the relative crystal \npacking (c). \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nc) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n56 Part 3. Results and discussion \n\nThe crystallographic analysis revealed the formation of linear chains formed through hydrogen \n\nbonds between the -CH moieties and one of the nitrogen atoms of the HMTA molecule. Due to \n\nsteric hindrance effects, the arrangement of the chains results in alternatively parallel rows. \n\nDifferently, from all the previous listed structures, both XB distances are 2.388 \u00c5, 29.76% less than \n\nthe sum of their vdW radii (Fig. 33a and b).91 Nevertheless, the polarization energy did not lead to \n\nthe formation of the tetracoordinated complex. \n\nThe angle formed between the NBP molecule and the HMTA one is not as linear as expected \n\n(172.25\u00b0). Even if the bond strength is high, the steric hindrance of NBP molecule makes the XB \n\ndonors assume a small angle alongside the noncovalent bond. \n\n \n\n3.8 Structure (HMTA)\u20222(NBS) \n\n \n\nThe solvate crystal structure shown in Figure 34 recalls the reported one in 2013 by Raatikainen \n\net al.62 \n\nThe complex was obtained by adding neat NBS directly to a solution of HMTA in chloroform. \n\nThis strategy aimed to avoid the cleavage of the covalently bound bromine-nitrogen atoms. In fact, \n\nN-bromosuccinimide is known to be a reagent employed mostly in free radical allylic and benzylic \n\nbrominations, and for the electrophilic substitution of aromatic rings.94 The addition of solid NBS to \n\na solution of HMTA increases the probability to have a direct interaction between the Lewis acid \n\nand the Lewis base. \n\n As expected, Figures 34a and b show two NBS molecules attached to one HMTA molecule. \n\nDifferently from the N-bromophthalimide case, contact distances result to be not of the same \n\nlength, 2.427 \u00c5 and 2.398 \u00c5, 28.62% and 29.47% less than the sum of their vdW radii.91 \n\nIn the crystallization process, the choice of the solvent played a key role. Chloroform is a \n\nhalogenated solvent containing hydrogen atoms, thus, halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding co-\n\nexist.95 Moreover, solvation had a significant influence on halogen bonding.83 As the structure \n\nanalysis shows, the framework contains chloroform molecules (Fig. 34c). They act as templates. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n57 Part 3.

The complex corresponds to three molecules of NBS interacting with the \n\nnucleophilic sites of the HMTA through XBs.

Consequently, \n\nthe second XB results stronger than the third one (2.378 \u00c5 and 2.411 \u00c5 respectively). \n\nAs expected for an n to ? interaction,96 also in this case, the halogen bond is directional. The \n\nangle between the covalent and noncovalent bonds is approximately of 180\u00b0 confirming that the \n\nXB is preferentially along the axis of the orbital containing the lone pair of the electron donor. \n\nMoreover the shorter the interactions, the more directional they are. Indeed, as the lengths of the \n\nthree bonds increase, the relative angles decrease from 177.90\u00b0 of the shorter bond to 175.37\u00b0of \n\nthe longer one. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 35 - A front view of the structure (HMTA)\u20224(NBS) with the distances between the three \nbromine atoms and the nucleophilic nitrogens of the HMTA molecule. \n\n \n\nFigure 36 describes the CPK representations of the complex.

Results and discussion \n\n3.10 Structure (HMTA)\u20224(NBS) @CCl4 \n\n \n\nThe persistent studies of the behavior of the NBS molecule with the nucleophilic tetrafunctional \n\nHMTA led to the complexation of the (HMTA)\u2022(NBS)4 motif, solvated with tetrachloromethane \n\nmolecules. The complex was obtained adopting the liquid-liquid diffusion crystallization technique. \n\nThe white interlayer formed after the addition of tetrachloromethane corresponded to a colloidal \n\ndispersion. Tetrachloromethane firstly induced a fast reaction and, then, due to the diffusion \n\nprocess, the system self-assembled around the solvent molecules and a host-channel system was \n\nformed (Fig. 38). The guest molecules adapted into the cavity through the electrostatic interactions \n\nwith the acidic protons of the NBS molecules. The channels occupy a volume of 934.3 \u00c53/cell, the \n\n41.5 % of the unit cell.  \n\nThe overall structure grew around the main motif (HMTA)\u20224(NBS) (Fig. 39), characterized by \n\nextremely short XB between the bromine and the nitrogen atoms, 2.401 \u00c5, 29.38 % less than the \n\nsum of their vdW radii.91 Differently, from the previous structures, all four-contact distances are of \n\nthe same length. The polarization strength of the nucleophilic sites on the Lewis base, therefore, is \n\nequal. This fact is confirmed by the directionality of the four interactions. All four angles are almost \n\nlinear, 179.33\u00b0, reflecting the high strength of the formed XBs.  \n\nAs reported in Raatikainen et al.,62 even if the complex is based on halogen interactions, the \n\nstructure\u2019 skeleton is built up through those of hydrogen type. Figure 38c puts on evidence the \n\nhydrogen interactions between the acidic CH2 groups of the HMTA molecule and the C=O\n- groups \n\nof the NBS one.  \n\nFurther studies have to be developed in order to test the stability of the pores by changing the \n\nguest molecules. The coexistence of these crystal precipitates with others in the bulk prevents the \n\ncalculations of the crystals yield from solution. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n61 Part 3.

Results and discussion \n\n3.11 Structure (HMTA)\u20222(NIS) \n\n \n\nThis structure was obtained by the combination of several crystallization techniques. Firstly, the \n\nNIS molecule in a solution of DCM was slowly added to a solution of HMTA in chloroform, forming \n\ntwo separates layers with an interface. The separation was remarked by the instant formation of \n\nwhite colloids. Just after one day, crystalline colourless needles appeared but they re-dissolved \n\ninto a solution that turned from colourless to a violet strong colour.  \n\nThe instant formation of colloids occurred because nucleation took place at a high degree of \n\nsupersaturation, so that the volume growth proceeds too quickly.75 Consequently, a third layer was \n\nintroduced in the interface between the two solutions to slow down the nucleation process. The \n\nHMTA solution was covered by the aprotic ACN, which acted as a diffusion chamber. Thus, NIS \n\nsolution was added. After three days, thin crystalline plates precipitated from solution. The \n\nexperiment was reproduced changing the crystallization solvents combination. Instead of \n\nsolubilizing the ligands in apolar solvents, both of them were solubilized in ACN. The interlayer \n\nbetween the two solutions corresponded to a les polar solvent, such as chloroform, DCM, \n\ntetrachloromethane and toluene. The results were the same, thin crystalline plates were obtained.  \n\nFigure 40 presents the motif of the crystal. The contact distances of both halogen interaction are \n\nthe same, 2.465 \u00c5. They result 30.17% shorter than the sum of their vdW radii.91 \n\nEven in this case, the system did not present just one type of precipitates. This inhomogeneity \n\naffects the yield, and just a small amount of crystalline precipitates was possible to obtain. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n63 Part 3.

Results and discussion \n\nEach distance between the iodine and the nitrogen atoms belonging to HMTA is remarkably \n\nshort, 2.501 \u00c5, which is about 29.15% shorter than the sum of their vdW radii.91 The angle of the \n\nbond, 177.79\u00b0, is almost linear confirming again the strong nature of the interaction.  \n\nThis stable supramolecular ribbon results when the self-complementary complexes stack and \n\ninterlink via multiple H-bonds from acidic CH2 groups of the HMTA molecule to C=O groups of the \n\nadjacent NIS moieties (Fig. 42).49 \n\nThe adducts are assembled parallel forming a porous structure, where the channels occupy a \n\nvolume of 949.1 \u00c53, four per cell, the 40.6% of the unit cell. The acidic CH2 groups of the HMTA \n\nfavour the adaptation of DCM guest molecules into the cavities. The stability of the channels, thus, \n\nresults reinforced by the templating effect of the solvent molecules. \n\nAs already shown, the crystal was obtained dissolving the ground neat starting materials in \n\nDCM. This fact implies that scheme 12 does not represent completely the reaction that led to the \n\nformation of this complex. The initial compounds, HMTA, NCS, and I2, have already reacted in the \n\nmortar under the pestle action. A single crystal X-ray analysis cannot furnish the crystal structure of \n\nthe powder material. Methodology for structure determination of molecular solids from powder X-\n\nray diffraction data can be applied to establish the effectiveness of the new solid phase.31 For \n\ntechnical reasons, powder X-Ray was not performed. \n\nBoth NCS and I2 are compound used in radical and electrophilic reactions. When ground \n\ntogether, the probability to form radicals increases due to the pressure applied by the mortar \n\naction. Once in solution, the molecular recognition induces the self-assembling forming, thus, the \n\ncomplex (HMTA)\u20224(NIS). The precipitation of the crystal occurred once the solution was \n\noversaturated and the colourless needles started to grow. Nevertheless, the inhomogeneity of the \n\nbulk system prevented the calculation of the yield. The use of chloroform instead of DCM led to \n\ntwin crystals, not good enough for a single crystal X-ray analysis. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n65 Part 3.

Conclusions \n\n4. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe present study gives an overview of several molecular crystal structures obtained by the \n\ncombination of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) with different halogen bond donors. The \n\nnucleophilic character of the XB acceptor is affected both by the type of the halogen bond donor \n\nand by the experimental conditions.  \n\nThe first crystalline structures were obtained by simply mixing solutions and leaving them under \n\neither vapor diffusion or slow evaporation at room temperature. The results have shown mostly \n\nmotifs with XB characterized by short contact distances; nevertheless, in most of the cases, the \n\ncomplexation of the structure is due to hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. \n\nWhen neat NBS was added directly to a solution of HMTA in chloroform, the polarized bromines \n\ninteracted with the four nitrogen atoms, forming the solvated structure of (HMTA)\u20224(NBS) with \n\nshort contact distances. Parallel, the mixture of HMTA and NIS solutions through the layering \n\ntechnique led to the crystallization of stable dimers.  \n\nMechanochemistry techniques maximized the electrophilic and nucleophilic interactions. In fact, \n\nby grinding HMTA molecules with weak and strong XB donors, such as NCS and molecular iodine, \n\nrespectively, a solvated porous structure with stable 3D channels was obtained. The combination \n\nof mechanochemistry, with the traditional crystallization techniques, led to the final porous crystal \n\nstructures.  \n\nNonetheless, some practical factors influenced the results such as the inhomogeneity of the \n\nbulk system. Indeed, the quality of the crystals resulted proper for single crystal X-Ray analysis, \n\nbut the amount obtained from solution was small.  \n\nIn futures works, special attention should be given to the characterization of the participant \n\nligands in the assembly of the final architecture throughout every step. X-Ray powder diffraction, \n\nnuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and single crystal X-Ray diffraction would suffice to \n\ncharacterize the ligands when in powder, in solution and in the final structure, single crystal.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n67 References \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n(1) Lu, G.
