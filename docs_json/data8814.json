Such vulnerability is expected to increase under a climate change \n\nscenario predicting a general increase in aridity, temperatures, frequency of extreme events and an \n\naccentuated decrease of precipitation. A significant proportion of drylands can be found within \n\nMediterranean ecosystems, which have been experiencing a marked expansion of semi-arid climate in \n\nrecent years due to climate change. This is becoming particularly alarming in the Iberian Peninsula, \n\nmainly in the southern Portuguese regions of Alentejo and Algarve. Drylands\u2019 DLD susceptibility will \n\nlead to a significant decrease in ecosystems\u2019 productivity, calling for the implementation of adaptation \n\nstrategies. Reforestation with holm-oak (Quercus ilex), cork-oak (Quercus suber) and stone-pine (Pinus \n\npinea) native species is a restoration practice that has been widely used in southern Portuguese drylands \n\nfor the last sixty years. However, there are several lacunae concerning the evaluation of reforestation\u2019s \n\ncharacteristics and success, which have not yet been properly evaluated, while it is also quite unusual to \n\nhave recourse to animal indicators to perform such evaluation.  \n\nThe present work aims to understand whether the European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus - \n\nLinnaeus, 1758) is a good indicator of the success of historical reforestations in southern Portuguese \n\ndrylands. The wild rabbit is a multifunctional keystone species in Mediterranean ecosystems, especially \n\nin the Iberian Peninsula, due to the multiplicity of relevant roles and impacts it has in habitat\u2019s structure \n\nand complexity as ecosystem engineers and \u201clandscape shapers\u201d, and as a main prey for a wide range \n\nof major predators, many of which are emblematic endangered species. Therefore, the wild rabbit \n\nexhibits several favourable conditions for being a good ecological indicator.  \n\nIn this work, the wild rabbit\u2019s relative abundance was estimated within holm-oak, cork-oak and \n\nstone-pine reforestation sites along an aridity gradient through southern regions of continental Portugal \n\nthrough latrine counting along foot-transects, using the number of latrines to calculate wild rabbits\u2019 \n\nKilometric Abundance Index (KAI) for each sampling site. The relation between wild rabbits\u2019 relative \n\nabundance and environmental parameters representative of habitat\u2019s structure and complexity within \n\nreforestations (vegetation, soil and climate characterisation performed by the AdaptforChange Project\u2019s \n\nresearch team, which examined the success of such reforestations) was evaluated, to determine whether \n\nthe wild rabbit performs relevant roles in reforestations\u2019 ecosystems, thus having the potential to be a \n\ngood indicator of the success of Portuguese dryland reforestations. Spearman correlations were \n\nperformed to identify possible relations between wild rabbit and reforestation variables, as well as \n\nANOVA analysis to test the effects between environmental parameters and rabbit variables. \n\nFurthermore, buffers and land use cartography were carried out for each sampling site to understand \n\nhow the composition and structure of the landscape may influence the presence and abundance of the \n\nwild rabbit in the study area. Spearman correlations were carried out between rabbit variables and \n\nhabitat/landscape variables (areas and percentages of occupation of each land-use class).  \n\nThe lack of association between rabbits\u2019 abundance, environmental parameters associated with \n\nreforestations and plantation areas determines that, unfortunately, the wild rabbit is indeed not a good \n\nindicator of the success of reforestations in southern Portuguese drylands. The wild rabbit\u2019s current \n\ndistribution and density situation in the Iberian Peninsula prevents the species from acting as a good \n\necological indicator, which is reinforced and confirmed by our results. Therefore, management and \n\nrecovery measures should be taken so that the species can regain a fundamental role as an ecological \n\nindicator. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Wild rabbit, Portuguese drylands, relative abundance, reforestations, ecological indicators \n\n\n\n \n\niii \n\nResumo  \n\nAs drylands s\u00e3o ecossistemas que ocupam aproximadamente metade da superf\u00edcie terrestre, sendo \n\ncaracterizadas por elevados \u00edndices de aridez e taxas de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o extremamente reduzidas.

Nos \u00faltimos anos, estes ecossistemas t\u00eam sofrido uma ex-\n\npans\u00e3o significativa do clima semi\u00e1rido em resultado das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas. Esta situa\u00e7\u00e3o tem-se \n\ntornado particularmente relevante e preocupante na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, nomeadamente no sudeste de \n\nPortugal continental, nas regi\u00f5es do Alentejo e Algarve, que t\u00eam sofrido uma expans\u00e3o dos climas se-\n\nmi\u00e1rido e seco sub-h\u00famido.  \n\nA elevada susceptibilidade destas regi\u00f5es \u00e0 desertifica\u00e7\u00e3o e degrada\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 agravada num cen\u00e1-\n\nrio atual de altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas que prev\u00ea um aumento generalizado dos \u00edndices de aridez, das tempe-\n\nraturas, da ocorr\u00eancia e intensidade de fen\u00f3menos extremos e decr\u00e9scimo acentuado da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nEssa susceptibilidade acrescida conduzir\u00e1 certamente a uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o significativa da produtividade bi-\n\nol\u00f3gica e econ\u00f3mica dos ecossistemas, apelando \u00e0 tomada de estrat\u00e9gias de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o no sentido de \n\nmitigar os efeitos das altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, atrav\u00e9s da promo\u00e7\u00e3o da resili\u00eancia dos ecossistemas e mi-\n\nnimiza\u00e7\u00e3o das suas vulnerabilidades aos efeitos clim\u00e1ticos adversos. \n\nA floresta contribuir\u00e1 nesse sentido ao desempenhar um importante papel no sequestro de car-\n\nbono, regula\u00e7\u00e3o clim\u00e1tica, promo\u00e7\u00e3o e conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da biodiversidade, complexidade do habitat, solo e \n\n\u00e1gua, auxiliando na minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos efeitos clim\u00e1ticos adversos, na preven\u00e7\u00e3o da desertifica\u00e7\u00e3o e de-\n\ngrada\u00e7\u00e3o e no aumento da resili\u00eancia dos ecossistemas a eventos extremos, de modo que estes possam \n\ncontinuar a produzir bens e servi\u00e7os com import\u00e2ncia econ\u00f3mica, ambiental e social.  \n\nDeste modo, a refloresta\u00e7\u00e3o com esp\u00e9cies aut\u00f3ctones, como sejam a azinheira (Quercus ilex), o \n\nsobreiro (Quercus suber) e o pinheiro-manso (Pinus pinea), \u00e9 um importante m\u00e9todo de restauro ecol\u00f3-\n\ngico de ecossistemas degradados que tem sido praticado no sudeste semi\u00e1rido portugu\u00eas, em regi\u00f5es \n\nn\u00e3o-produtivas ou agr\u00edcolas abandonadas, no decurso dos \u00faltimos 40 a 60 anos. As esp\u00e9cies aut\u00f3ctones \n\ns\u00e3o ideais neste contexto dada a sua excepcional resili\u00eancia e capacidade de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o a climas \u00e1ridos, \n\nconseguindo atenuar efeitos clim\u00e1ticos adversos. Apesar disso, refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es com esp\u00e9cies nativas em \n\nregi\u00f5es semi\u00e1ridas est\u00e3o geralmente associadas a reduzidas probabilidades de sucesso, dado o reduzido \n\ncrescimento das \u00e1rvores e elevada mortalidade das pl\u00e2ntulas nos primeiros anos de vida, sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde secura extrema e escassez h\u00eddrica.  \n\nEm Portugal, existem diversas lacunas no que concerne a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das caracter\u00edsticas, do estado \n\natual e at\u00e9 do sucesso das refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas no semi\u00e1rido, n\u00e3o tendo ocorrido ainda uma avalia-\n\n\u00e7\u00e3o integrada e sistem\u00e1tica das mesmas. As poucas avalia\u00e7\u00f5es que s\u00e3o realizadas restringem-se frequen-\n\ntemente ao estudo da estrutura, crescimento e funcionamento das comunidades vegetais, sendo pouco \n\nusual o recurso a indicadores animais para tal avalia\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nO presente trabalho teve assim por objetivo determinar se o coelho-bravo (Oryctolagus cuniculus \n\n- Linnaeus, 1758) \u00e9 um bom indicador do sucesso de refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas no semi\u00e1rido hist\u00f3rico \n\nportugu\u00eas no decurso das \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas.  \n\nO coelho-bravo \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie-chave nos ecossistemas mediterr\u00e2nicos, especialmente na Pen\u00edn-\n\nsula Ib\u00e9rica, devido \u00e0 multiplicidade de pap\u00e9is e efeitos relevantes que desempenha a n\u00edvel da estrutura, \n\nfuncionamento, din\u00e2mica e complexidade nesses habitats. Eles s\u00e3o importantes engenheiros de ecossis-\n\ntemas e desempenham um papel preponderante enquanto modeladores da paisagem, dada a sua influ-\n\n\u00eancia e efeitos significativos a n\u00edvel da composi\u00e7\u00e3o e estrutura da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o e capacidade incr\u00edvel de \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n\nproduzir altera\u00e7\u00f5es relevantes na paisagem. Al\u00e9m disto, est\u00e3o na base das cadeias tr\u00f3ficas mediterr\u00e2ni-\n\ncas, constituindo a presa principal de um alargado leque de predadores de topo, sendo que alguns s\u00e3o \n\nesp\u00e9cies emblem\u00e1ticas amea\u00e7adas (lince-ib\u00e9rico, \u00e1guia-imperial-ib\u00e9rica e abutre-preto), sendo impor-\n\ntantes a n\u00edvel da din\u00e2mica das cadeias alimentares pela influ\u00eancia que t\u00eam nas flutua\u00e7\u00f5es nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde predadores. Al\u00e9m disso, as paisagens heterog\u00e9neas mediterr\u00e2nicas compostas por mosaicos de \u00e1reas \n\nflorestadas de azinheira e sobreiro intercaladas com patches de arbustos e regi\u00f5es abertas (\u00e1reas agr\u00edco-\n\nlas, prados e pastagens) constituem os habitats ideais para o coelho, uma vez que lhe permitem optimizar \n\no esfor\u00e7o da procura de alimento (em regi\u00f5es abertas ricas em plantas herb\u00e1ceas e cereais) e minimizar \n\no risco de preda\u00e7\u00e3o (nas regi\u00f5es fechadas, como as florestais e com arbustos para prote\u00e7\u00e3o).  \n\nDeste modo, e dada a estrita rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a presen\u00e7a e abund\u00e2ncia do coelho-bravo e a estrutura \n\ne complexidade do habitat, o coelho-bravo re\u00fane todas as caracter\u00edsticas favor\u00e1veis para ser um bom \n\nindicador ecol\u00f3gico.  \n\nNeste trabalho, a abund\u00e2ncia relativa de coelho-bravo foi estimada num total de vinte e tr\u00eas re-\n\nfloresta\u00e7\u00f5es de Quercus suber, Quercus ilex e Pinus pinea localizadas no semi\u00e1rido hist\u00f3rico portugu\u00eas, \n\nnas regi\u00f5es do Alentejo e Algarve, ao longo de um gradiente de aridez. A abund\u00e2ncia relativa do coelho \n\nfoi estimada atrav\u00e9s da contagem de latrinas ao longo de transetos lineares, tendo sido posteriormente \n\nusado o n\u00famero total de latrinas detectadas e a dist\u00e2ncia total percorrida para calcular o \u00cdndice Quilo-\n\nm\u00e9trico de Abund\u00e2ncia (IQA) para cada ponto de amostragem.  \n\nFoi posteriormente avaliada a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a abund\u00e2ncia relativa de coelho-bravo e par\u00e2metros \n\nambientais representativos da estrutura e complexidade do habitat das refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es (dados resultantes \n\nda caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, solo e clima realizados pela equipa de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o do Projeto Nacional \n\nAdaptforChange, que avaliou o sucesso de refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas no semi\u00e1rido hist\u00f3rico portugu\u00eas). \n\nTais rela\u00e7\u00f5es foram avaliadas no sentido de determinar se o coelho-bravo desempenha pap\u00e9is relevantes \n\nnos ecossistemas associados \u00e0s refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es, logo se pode ser classificado como um bom indicador do \n\nsucesso de refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es em regi\u00f5es semi\u00e1ridas portuguesas.  \n\nForam realizadas correla\u00e7\u00f5es de Spearman para identificar poss\u00edveis rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre as vari\u00e1veis \n\nassociadas ao coelho-bravo e as vari\u00e1veis ambientais associadas \u00e0s refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es, bem como An\u00e1lises \n\nde Vari\u00e2ncia (ANOVA) para testar os efeitos entre determinados par\u00e2metros ambientais, como sejam o \n\ntipo dominante de refloresta\u00e7\u00e3o, a presen\u00e7a de Pinus pinea, a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial dos arbustos e o tipo \n\nde solo dominante, e o conjunto de vari\u00e1veis relativas ao coelho-bravo.  \n\nPara al\u00e9m disso, foram realizados buffers com um raio de 250 metros para cada um dos pontos de \n\namostragem, tendo sido posteriormente elaborada uma cartografia ao n\u00edvel da ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e usos do solo, \n\nessencialmente focada nos tipos de coberto vegetal (planta\u00e7\u00f5es dominadas por Quercus ou por Pinus; \n\nmontados; prados e pastagens; matos), presen\u00e7a de \u00e1gua (massas de \u00e1gua) e ind\u00edcios de presen\u00e7a e ocu-\n\npa\u00e7\u00e3o humana (habita\u00e7\u00f5es e pomares; infra-estruturas; ru\u00ednas e po\u00e7os abandonados; estradas alcatroa-\n\ndas), para os buffers previamente obtidos. A cartografia foi elaborada com o intuito de realizar uma \n\nan\u00e1lise da diversidade de usos do solo, e assim perceber como a composi\u00e7\u00e3o e estrutura da paisagem \n\ninfluenciam a presen\u00e7a e abund\u00e2ncia de coelho-bravo na \u00e1rea de estudo. Foram realizadas correla\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde Spearman para determinar as rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre as vari\u00e1veis relativas ao coelho-bravo e as vari\u00e1veis de \n\nhabitat (\u00e1reas e percentagens de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o de cada classe de uso do solo).  \n\nApesar da \u00e1rea de estudo apresentar uma paisagem heterog\u00e9nea composta por mosaicos de dife-\n\nrentes habitats sendo as planta\u00e7\u00f5es o uso do solo dominante, e de se terem verificado algumas rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nsignificativas entre a abund\u00e2ncia de coelho e vari\u00e1veis de habitat, a verdade \u00e9 que n\u00e3o se verificou \n\nnenhuma rela\u00e7\u00e3o significativa com as planta\u00e7\u00f5es. A aus\u00eancia de associa\u00e7\u00e3o significativa entre a abun-\n\nd\u00e2ncia relativa de coelho-bravo, as vari\u00e1veis ambientais associadas \u00e0 estrutura e complexidade das re-\n\nfloresta\u00e7\u00f5es e as \u00e1reas das planta\u00e7\u00f5es determina que, infelizmente, o coelho-bravo n\u00e3o \u00e9 efetivamente \n\num bom indicador do sucesso de refloresta\u00e7\u00f5es nas drylands do sudeste de Portugal continental. Apesar \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n\ndo coelho-bravo reunir todos os requisitos necess\u00e1rios para ser um bom indicador ecol\u00f3gico, a verdade \n\n\u00e9 que ele acaba por n\u00e3o o ser na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, especialmente em Portugal, dada a sua atual distri-\n\nbui\u00e7\u00e3o desigual e as suas densidades extremamente vari\u00e1veis e altamente fragmentadas ao longo do \n\nterrit\u00f3rio de Portugal e Espanha.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1 - Drylands &amp; Reforestations in Mediterranean semi-arid regions  \n\nA brief overview of drylands\u2019 main features and vulnerabilities \n\nDrylands are characterised by high aridity levels which encompass hyper-arid (Aridity Index \n\nlower than 0.05), arid (Aridity Index between 0.05 and 0.20), semi-arid (aridity ranging from 0.20 to \n\n0.50) and dry sub-humid (aridity gradient from 0.50 to 0.65) areas (MEA 2005a; Reynolds et al. 2007) \n\nand extremely low precipitation rates, in accordance with the Aridity Index of the United Nations Envi-\n\nronment Programme (UNEP), and in relation to the ratio between annual mean precipitation and annual \n\npotential evapotranspiration (Middleton &amp; Thomas 1997; Nunes 2017).   \n\nDrylands occupy almost 50% of the Earth\u2019s land surface (6.15\u00d7106 ha), distributed throughout \n\nfour continents, covering from 31% (South America) to 75% (Australia) of the continental land area, \n\nand are inhabited by more than 38% of the total global population (Figure 1.1) (Reynolds &amp; Stafford \n\nSmith 2002; Reynolds et al. 2007; UNCCD 2012).  \n\nThis type of land is extremely vulnerable to desertification and land degradation (DLD) due to \n\nhigh aridity levels coupled with intense human occupation, pressure, and land cover changes over past \n\ndecades, such as removal of vegetation caused by land-use intensification for crop production, agricul-\n\nture, grazing, and deforestation (Belo et al. 2009; Cortina &amp; Maestre 2005; MEA 2005a; MEA 2005b; \n\nMiddleton &amp; Thomas 1997; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014; UNCCD 2012). These factors unfortunately contribute \n\nto a significant decrease or even loss of ecosystem functionality, composition and biological or eco-\n\nnomic productivity over time (Costa et al. 2008; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014; UNCCD 2012), which directly \n\ninfluences their provision of ecosystem services (MEA 2005a). Besides being extremely vulnerable to \n\nDLD effects, drylands are also highly vulnerable to climate change (Nunes 2017; Reynolds et al. 2007). \n\nDrylands amidst Mediterranean regions in a climate change perspective \n\nA considerable proportion of drylands is found within Mediterranean ecosystems, such as the \n\nMediterranean Basin (where approximately 67% of the territory is occupied by drylands) (Nunes 2017; \n\nNunes et al. 2016b; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014). Their DLD susceptibility is expected to increase under a \n\nclimate change scenario that estimates an accentuated increase of average temperatures, a decrease in \n\nrainfall and shifts in precipitation frequency and patterns, more frequent and severe occurrence of ex-\n\ntreme events (heat waves, droughts and storms), and higher aridity levels, for the Southeastern \n\nFigure 1.1 - Worldwide distribution of drylands according to their specific \n\nsubtypes. Adapted from MEA 2005b. \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nMediterranean, especially in Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula (Costa et al. 2008; ICNF 2013; IPCC \n\n2014; MEA 2005a; Miranda et al. 2006).  \n\nOver the past decades, a significant expansion of semi-arid climate has been occurring in Medi-\n\nterranean ecosystems, mainly due to climate change (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). \n\nThis situation is unfortunately gaining relevance in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in the south-\n\neast Alentejo and Algarve regions of Portugal, in which a significative expansion of both semi-arid and \n\ndry sub-humid climate over past years has been occurring (Figure 1.2) (Costa et al. 2008; K\u00f6bel et al. \n\n2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). This expansion in the Portuguese territory is mainly due to a global increase \n\nof temperatures that has been under way since 1970, responsible for more frequent and intense drought \n\nevents, storms and heavy rainfall periods, and decreased precipitation rates within irregular rainfall re-\n\ngimes (MAMAOT 2013; Miranda et al. 2006; Nunes et al. 2016a; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014).  \n\nGiven drylands\u2019 enhanced vulnerability under this scenario, especially in southern Portuguese \n\nregions, it is vital to adopt adaptation strategies, such as the restoration of degraded ecosystems, to mit-\n\nigate climate change effects and minimize ecosystems\u2019 vulnerabilities under climate constraints (Cortina \n\n&amp; Maestre 2005; MAMAOT 2013; Nunes et al. 2016a; Vizinho 2015). This can be achieved through \n\nthe promotion of ecosystem species and habitats\u2019 resilience, adaptation, and sustainability, and of eco-\n\nsystem services and assets\u2019 provision (providing products related to economic welfare such as wood and \n\ncork) (MAMAOT 2013; Nunes et al. 2016a; Pereira et al. 2009; Vizinho 2015). \n\nReforestation with native species - restoration strategy for drylands under climate change  \n\nAmong ecological restoration programs concerning plant species, reforestations with native \n\nspecies is a frequently used forestry management strategy, as it helps to ameliorate desertification and \n\nland degradation effects on drylands and promote their resilience and adaptation capacities to climate \n\nchange (AdaptforChange 2015; K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; MAMAOT 2013; Nunes et al. 2016a; Pereira et al. \n\n2009; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014). \n\nAutochthonous forests play fundamental roles in support services, such as primary productivity, \n\nand in regulation services - soil erosion\u2019s prevention and protection through plant cover; facilitation of \n\ncarbon sequestration within plant biomass and in the soil; climatic regulation; increase of biodiversity, \n\nFigure 1.2 - Aridity expansion over past \n\nyears in continental Portugal. \n\n(left) historical aridity gradient [1961-1990]; \n\n(right) current aridity [1980-2010]. \n\nAdapted from AdaptforChange 2015. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\norganic matter, habitat complexity, water infiltration in the soil, productivity; decrease in the risk of fires \n\nand the incidence of plagues and diseases; and promotion of a wider production of ecosystem assets and \n\nservices with economic, environmental and social relevance (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; MAMAOT 2013; Nunes \n\n2017; Pereira et al. 2009; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014).  \n\nReforesting wide dryland areas with different native species will contribute to a major increase \n\nof tree cover and a wider diversity of species, which is fundamental to mitigate aridity effects and to \n\npotentiate forestry ecosystems\u2019 resilience in the face of extreme events. These forests promote the re-\n\ncovery of the structure, composition and function of such ecosystems so they can continue producing \n\nassets and services with higher economic return (Cortina &amp; Maestre 2005; K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes \n\n2017; Pereira et al. 2009; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014; Rey Benayas &amp; Camacho-Cruz 2004). On the other hand, \n\nthey will also help revert downshifts in tree growth and natural regeneration among forest settlements \n\nin highly susceptible dryland areas (Middleton &amp; Thomas 1997; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014; Silva 2012).  \n\nNative species have an exceptional adaptation and resistance to arid climates, making them highly \n\nsuitable for reforestations undertaken in dryland ecosystems, as they can attenuate negative climatic \n\neffects imposed by high aridity levels and decreased precipitation rates (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Pr\u00edncipe et \n\nal. 2014).  \n\nAccording to a global survey of dryland reforestations, a significant number of reforestation pro-\n\njects have been carried out within these regions for the restoration of degraded ecosystems. Such projects \n\nhave been performed both worldwide and across the Mediterranean Basin, with emphasis in the Iberian \n\nPeninsula\u2019s dryland areas (Figure 1.3) (Nunes et al. 2016b). \n\nForestry &amp; reforestation policies in the Portuguese territory  \n\nFor millennia, holm-oaks and cork-oaks were the dominant woodlands system within continental \n\nPortugal, and were used for the harvesting of economically and industrially valuable resources in re-\n\nsponse to the demands of industry and urban centres (wood, cork, fibre, among others). However, until \n\nthe middle of the 20th century, rural populations converted such forested areas into subsistence agricul-\n\ntural fields and livestock grazing areas (Pereira et al. 2009; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014). Throughout the fol-\n\nlowing years, the economic return associated with such activities ceased and so those areas became \n\nunproductive, which led to their abandonment and to an increase in rural exodus (Nunes et al. 2016a; \n\nPereira et al. 2009; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014).  \n\nSuch non-productive agricultural and grazing lands or marginal terrains were later converted to \n\nforested areas, especially since Portugal\u2019s entry in the European Union (Nunes et al. 2016a; Pereira et \n\nFigure 1.3 - Reforestation restoration projects carried out in the Mediter-\n\nranean Basin within dryland and non-dryland areas. \n\nAdapted from Nunes et al. 2015. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nal. 2009; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014). This was mainly due to higher private investments related to economic \n\ninterests, to the promotion of afforestation initiatives and to forests\u2019 natural regeneration (K\u00f6bel et al. \n\n2017; MAMAOT 2013). Nowadays forests are indeed the dominant form of land use in continental \n\nPortugal, occupying 35.4% of the territory, one of the highest afforestation rates within the European \n\nUnion (ICNF 2013; ICNF 2014; K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; MAMAOT 2013).  \n\nReforestations with native species within Southern Portuguese drylands  \n\nThe Portuguese government, along with the Instituto da Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da Natureza e Florestas \n\n(ICNF), the Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA), landowners, national park managers, municipali-\n\nties, Environmental Non-Governmental Agencies (ENGOs), and private and public companies, have \n\nbeen promoting and implementing in the last forty to sixty years several reforestation initiatives with \n\ncork-oak (Quercus suber), holm-oak (Quercus ilex) and stone-pine (Pinus pinea) native species (K\u00f6bel \n\net al. 2017; MAMAOT 2013; Nunes et al. 2016a; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014). Such reforestations, a vital \n\ncomponent of the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (ENAAC), have been carried out \n\nin non-productive or abandoned agricultural and grazing areas with higher aridity (semiarid and dry sub-\n\nhumid areas), particularly in the southeast region of the Alentejo (Figure 1.4) (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes \n\net al. 2016a; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014).  \n\nAccording to the National Forestry Inventory, in 2010 there were 328 578 ha occupied by refor-\n\nestations of holm-oak, 730 399 ha of cork-oak and finally 173 716 ha of stone-pine trees (ICNF 2016, \n\ncited by K\u00f6bel et al. 2017). Reforestation projects that were submitted between 2013 and 2016 encom-\n\npassed a total of 53 659 ha that were reforested, and from these, 8 432 ha were occupied by cork-oak \n\n(16%), 4 887 ha by stone-pine (9%), while only 1 029 ha by holm-oak (2%). There was a total of 280 \n\nprojects that were approved and validated in the Alentejo region, occupying a total area of 6 101 ha \n\n(ICNF 2016, cited by K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). Many reforestation efforts took place in \n\nthe sub-region of Alentejo Interior, such as holm-oak reforestations undertaken in 1995 and 2009 in the \n\nHerdade da Contenda (Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014; Rey Benayas &amp; Camacho-Cruz 2004; Silva 2012).  \n\nHolm-oak, cork-oak and stone-pine are the most commonly used species for the restoration of \n\nwoodlands in Mediterranean ecosystems (ICNF 2014; Nunes 2017; Oliet et al. 2015; Pr\u00edncipe et al. \n\n2014; Ramos et al. 2015), due to their exceptionally high resilience to drought events, being physiolog-\n\nically adapted to water scarcity (ICNF 2014; MAMAOT 2013), and since they are extensively \n\nFigure 1.4 - Examples of reforestations in the southeast region of the \n\nAlentejo, continental Portugal.

Photographs taken during fieldwork. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\ndistributed and considerably abundant within drier Mediterranean areas (Belo et al. 2009; Bravo-Oviedo \n\n&amp; Montero 2005; MAMAOT 2013; Pereira et al. 2009; Ramos et al. 2015).  \n\nInvesting in differential reforestation activities and practices and in more than one tree species \n\nwill considerably reduce the risks of both forest settlements\u2019 failure and of ecological and economic \n\nlosses under a more arid scenario (AdaptforChange 2015; ICNF 2014).   \n\nLow success rates of reforestation &amp; natural regeneration in Portuguese drylands \n\nUnfortunately, most of the reforestation efforts carried out within southern Portuguese drylands \n\nproved to be unsuccessful in the long term or at least had a very minimal success rate, which is consistent \n\nwith the extremely low success rates and prominent failure of most reforestation programs carried out \n\nfor the ecological restoration of Mediterranean drylands (Oliet et al. 2015; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014).  \n\nMediterranean dryland reforestations\u2019 low success rates or even failure is mainly due to climatic \n\nconstraints imposed by high aridity, summer droughts, and high variability in rainfall regimes coupled \n\nwith water scarcity (Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014; Rey Benayas &amp; Camacho-Cruz 2004; Silva 2012). The latter \n\ngreatly improve stressing effects in plants and are responsible for trees\u2019 limited survival, growth and \n\nproductivity during the first years after planting, and for restricted tree recruitment (ICNF 2014; \n\nMAMAOT 2013; Oliet et al. 2015; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014), as well as for extremely low rates of natural \n\ntree regeneration related to the slow growth and high seedling mortality rates (ICNF 2014; Pr\u00edncipe et \n\nal. 2014; Rey Benayas &amp; Camacho-Cruz 2004; Silva 2012).  \n\nAfforestations\u2019 success evaluation - limitations, difficulties &amp; weaknesses  \n\nIn Portugal, information regarding reforestation characteristics, results, and even their success \n\nrates are extremely scarce and dispersed, mainly due to the limitations and difficulties associated with \n\nthe use of a very heterogeneous set of reforestation and evaluation methodologies in different macrocli-\n\nmatic areas (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). In fact, until now there has been no proper systematic \n\nand integrated evaluation of the success associated with different Portuguese dryland afforestations per-\n\nformed in recent years.  \n\nEcological restoration success evaluations are essentially focused on the structure and functioning \n\nof plant communities (Mexia 2008), and as such, these evaluations are usually restricted to punctual \n\ninspections or evaluations concerning tree density, as to guarantee the maintenance of a certain mini-\n\nmum tree density that is required for the preservation and viability of afforestations (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; \n\nNunes et al. 2016a).  \n\nFor these cases, evaluations were restricted since they only concerned the establishment and \n\ngrowth of planted trees, without considering the potential effects and impacts of reforestation actions \n\nupon ecosystems\u2019 parameters - such as the natural regeneration of trees, plant diversity and productivity \n\nand soil quality, functionality and sustainability, and evaluation of the impacts of climatic constraints \n\nrelated to more arid conditions and lower water availability in afforestations. From this perspective, an \n\nefficient and successful evaluation of Portuguese afforestations is lacking, and it is vital not only to \n\nunderstand whether reforestations are fulfilling the objectives proposed for the arid areas, but also to \n\nevaluate their resilience under a climate change scenario (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nProject AdaptforChange - finding ways to improve reforestation success in semi-arid lands \n\nThe Project AdaptforChange is a National Research Project carried out in 2015 and 2016 that has \n\naimed to assess the status and the degree of success of historical reforestations with native species: holm-\n\noak (Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia); cork-oak (Quercus suber), and stone-pine (Pinus pinea), imple-\n\nmented in southern Portuguese drylands along an aridity gradient, in order to understand in which ways \n\nreforestation practices and environmental conditions (such as climate) affect the ecosystem (K\u00f6bel et \n\nal. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). \n\nTo evaluate reforestation success, the relationship between certain ecosystem parameters (tree, \n\nshrub and herbaceous diversity and productivity; natural tree regeneration; soil quality; structural habitat \n\ndiversity; ecosystem services [including biodiversity evaluations]), and climatic data (mainly aridity, \n\nsince climate imposes strong constrains on plant development in the study area) was evaluated for a set \n\nof holm-oak, cork-oak and stone pine reforestations throughout the Alentejo region (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; \n\nNunes et al. 2016a). \n\nThe results obtained have demonstrated that both reforestation practices and environmental con-\n\nditions play vital roles in shaping the ecosystem. Reforestation objectives should be planned and man-\n\naged in a more flexible way and be more adapted according to the specific objectives or ecosystem \n\nservices for each case, taking into consideration the specific climatic and topographic context of the \n\ntarget areas. Reforestations should also be implemented in such a way as to guarantee long-term sus-\n\ntainability, to increase ecosystem resilience and to diversify income sources for local populations under \n\na climate change scenario of increasing aridity in the coming decades (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. \n\n2016a).  \n\nThe potential of animal indicators for evaluating reforestation success  \n\nIn many restoration projects, especially in those concerning afforestations, using animal indica-\n\ntors for success evaluations on habitat and food webs\u2019 structure and complexity (ecological succession) \n\nis indeed not very frequent (Mexia 2008).  \n\nAn international inquiry in areas with conservation interest has shown that, from a total of fifty \n\nrestoration projects undertaken in Portuguese semiarid regions that performed success evaluations, only \n\nsix of them truly measured the number of species and/or animal abundance and used it as an indicator \n\nof such success (Alice Nunes &amp; Cristina Branquinho - unpublished data).  \n\nThis reinforces the need for alternative success indicators, such as animal ones, that may have the \n\npotential to help understand whether reforestation efforts were indeed successful, if they represented a \n\ngood investment in the Portuguese territory, and if they are contributing somehow to increase ecosys-\n\ntems\u2019 resilience to Climate Change through an enhanced habitat structure, complexity, and diversity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n1.2 - The European wild rabbit amidst Mediterranean drylands \n\nA brief overview of rabbit\u2019s taxonomy &amp; distribution  \n\nThe European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus \n\n(Linnaeus, 1758) is a small herbivorous mammal that be-\n\nlongs to the Lagomorpha Order and Leporidae Family (Fig-\n\nure 1.5) (ICNF 2005; Smith &amp; Boyer 2008).   \n\nThe wild rabbit is a native species from the Iberian \n\nPeninsula (Alves et al. 2008; Ferreira 2003; Mira et al. \n\n2007) and the North-western African regions of Morocco \n\nand Algeria, only occurring naturally within those regions \n\nof the Mediterranean Basin (G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; ICNF \n\n2005; Rodrigues de Barros 2016).  \n\nTheir current worldwide distribution, from across the \n\nEuropean continent, including Madeira and the Azores is-\n\nlands, Canarias and Baleares, to several other regions of the \n\nworld, such as Australia, New Zealand and some parts of \n\nSouth America and North Africa (Figure 1.6), is due to sev-\n\neral deliberate introductions over past decades, given their relevance as a food or cinegetic resource \n\n(Alves et al. 2008; Ferreira 2003; ICNF 2005; Rodrigues de Barros 2016; Smith &amp; Boyer 2008). Wild \n\nrabbit\u2019s successful establishment in other countries is mainly due to their high ecological plasticity, \n\ncolonizing and adaptation capacities within several types of habitat, coupled with elevated reproduction \n\nrates and favourable ecological conditions (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez et al. \n\n2008; Smith &amp; Boyer 2008; Ward 2005). However, it is considered a plague in many countries where it \n\nhas been introduced, such as in Australia, New Zealand and England, due to their damaging effects to \n\nagriculture, native species and ecosystems (Alves et al. 2008; Smith &amp; Boyer 2008; Ward 2005).  \n\nShort description of rabbit\u2019s behaviour, social organization &amp; reproduction \n\nWild rabbits are active during twilight and at night (Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011), spending \n\nmuch of the day resting underground. Rabbits usually only come out of their burrows at dawn and dusk \n\ntime to graze and feed in areas relatively close to their warrens. Such nocturnal habits constitute an \n\nFigure 1.5 - Illustration of the wild rabbit.  \n\nAdapted from ICNF 2005. \n\nFigure 1.6 - Wild rabbit's current distribution across the world. \n\nAdapted from Smith &amp; Boyer 2008. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nefficient strategy to reduce the predation risk related to hunting pressure and/or diurnal predators (Fer-\n\nreira 2003; Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015). They also tend to avoid dirt tracks during \n\nthe day to prevent human disturbance, although they can be spotted in broad daylight on warm, sunny \n\ndays in undisturbed places (Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Zim &amp; Hoffmeister 1955).  \n\nThe wild rabbit is indeed the lagomorph species that exhibits the most complex social \n\norganization. Each social group is formed by a dominant male and several reproductive females along \n\nwith juveniles and subordinated males, being its social structure determined by habitat quality as well \n\nas shelter and food availability (G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015). Digging burrows is a relevant \n\ncomponent of wild rabbits\u2019 social organization, which is used by different social groups (Ferreira 2003; \n\nG\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; G\u00e1lvez et al. 2008). Warrens are a complex group of burrows that several rabbits \n\nhave been building up for a considerable amount of time. They are of vital importance to rabbit \n\npopulations, as rabbits establish their vital domain around them, and are indispensable for rabbit\u2019s \n\nreproduction and protection against potential predators (Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves \n\n2015).  \n\nRabbits are very popular for their prolific nature, as they are one of the fewest vertebrate species, \n\nand unlike other lagomorphs, in which females can be sexually receptive during the whole year (G\u00e1lvez-\n\nBravo 2011; Smith &amp; Boyer 2008; Solinas 1998; Zim &amp; Hoffmeister 1955). Therefore, they exhibit a \n\nconsiderably accelerated reproductive rate, being able to produce more than twenty cubs annually \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Rodrigues de Barros 2016). Their breeding period is highly dependent on plant \n\navailability and climatic conditions. Nonetheless, such a prolific nature is usually counterbalanced by \n\nnumerous casualties due to the action of external factors such as predators, disease, road traffic, shooting \n\nand trapping (Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; Ward 2005).  \n\nOn wild rabbit\u2019s basic trophic ecology  \n\nThe wild rabbit is a generalist herbivorous species that feeds on a wide set of herbaceous and \n\ncereal species, mainly grasses and leguminous plants, though they preferably chose to feed on grasses, \n\nespecially from dry pastures, as these have the highest nutritive value, protein levels and reduced fibres\u2019 \n\ncontent (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves 2015).  \n\nHowever, they can alter their dietary choices and feeding strategy according to plant availability \n\nand nutritional content in their habitats (Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Morgado 2008; Sim\u00f5es 2010). \n\nThis nutritional adaptation is highly relevant especially within Mediterranean climate and ecosystems, \n\nwhere food resources\u2019 availability can be quite differential (Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Sim\u00f5es 2010). Therefore, \n\nthey feed on alternative plants with lower nutritive value, such as Cistaceae, Compositae, and Ericaceae, \n\nwhen grasses are less abundant or not present, especially during the Summer season, and may have to \n\nfeed on other poorly nutritional parts of those plants (leaves, barks and small pieces of roots) (Fernandes \n\ndos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011). \n\nRabbits go through a special physiological mechanism called caecotrophy, in which they re-ingest \n\ntheir own cecotrophic pellets (soft white, bacteria and protein-rich droppings), and then go through a \n\nsecond digestion to later produce a second type of pellets, which are definitive harsh droppings that are \n\npermanently deposited in the soil (G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gil-Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2015). This is a very efficient \n\nstrategy as it maximizes nutrient and water intake by rabbits, especially when they feed on plants with \n\nlower nutritive value (Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gil-Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2015). These definitive \n\npellets can be found either dispersed or deposited in latrines by rabbits that belong to the same social \n\ngroup (Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011).  \n\nLatrines are faecal pellet clusters of at least twenty or thirty droppings typically found inside \n\nrabbits\u2019 vital domain that play vital roles in the demarcation of their territory (Figure 1.7) (Ferreira 2003; \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nG\u00e1lvez et al. 2008; Morgado 2008). The act of depositing droppings in latrines constitutes a vital social \n\ninteraction between rabbits, being important for olfactive communication among individuals (G\u00e1lvez-\n\nBravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Sneddon 1991). Rabbits show evidence of a behavioural pattern concern-\n\ning droppings and latrines\u2019 location and deposition, as they recurrently tend to choose specific locations \n\nwithin their territories to deposit them (Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Morgado 2008; Sneddon 1991). There is indeed \n\na strong behavioural component of latrine abundance, which may not be necessarily linked to rabbit \n\nabundance per se, given that rabbits tendentially choose the same regions to deposit their pellets (Fer-\n\nnandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Sneddon 1991). Latrines can be usually found in more opened regions \n\nthat do not exhibit significant degrees of steepness, preferably in undisturbed arenaceous and/or granitic \n\nsoils with some herbaceous cover, such as along dirt tracks, earthen, tilled land, among pasture regions \n\nand in the proximity of burrows (Margarida Santos-Reis &amp; Sandra Alcobia - personal communication). \n\nRabbit latrines are in this way visible elements that reveal wild rabbit\u2019s presence in a certain region, and \n\ncan be used to obtain indirect estimates of their relative abundance in those regions (Virg\u00f3s et al. 2003).  \n\nDropping accumulation within latrines presents very particular physical and chemical character-\n\nistics that provide an important nutrient source, contributing to soil fertility, the increase of plant diver-\n\nsity and biomass, altering its floristic composition, and being beneficial for coprophagous beetle com-\n\nmunities (Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; G\u00e1lvez et al. 2008). \n\nWild rabbit\u2019s presence &amp; abundance estimation methods - a summary  \n\nUntil the present time, no methods capable of performing direct and exact measures of wild rabbit \n\npopulation size(s) are known. It is indeed only possible to estimate relative abundance, and to detect and \n\nevaluate population density fluctuations, through resource to indirect methods (Fernandez-de-Simon et \n\nal. 2011; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014).  \n\nThese allow us to obtain species\u2019 abundance indices through the quantification of presence and \n\nactivity traces, such as droppings, latrines, scratchings, footprints, burrows, warrens, among others, \n\nwhich are usually visible and easily identifiable elements (Ferreira 2003; Sim\u00f5es 2010). The most \n\nfrequently used trace presence prospection methods include linear transects on foot recording rabbit \n\nsigns (Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Sarmento et al. 2004); cleared-plot pellet counts at permanent \n\nplots (Catal\u00e1n et al. 2008; Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003); and finally standing crop counts \n\n(Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Moreno &amp; Villafuerte 1995).  \n\nIn general, indirect methods do not involve large economic nor human resources and are easily \n\napplicable, allowing for the obtaining of reasonably accurate presence and relative abundance estimates \n\nin a simple, time-efficient and non-expensive way (Ferreira 2003; Sim\u00f5es 2009; Sim\u00f5es 2010). Since \n\ntheir precision does not depend on animals\u2019 detection or capture, presence trace prospections - such as \n\npellet-count indices - are the most suitable and reliable ones to study less conspicuous species and that \n\nFigure 1.7 - Examples of wild rabbit\u2019s latrines.  \n\nPhotographs taken during fieldwork. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\noccur in low to very low densities, such as the wild rabbit in Portugal nowadays (Fernandes dos Santos \n\n2009; Ferreira 2003). From this perspective, LATR (Latrine index - latrines/km) has been recently \n\nadopted as a standardized method for monitoring rabbits in Portugal (Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; \n\nLPN 2014; Sarmento et al. 2004).  \n\nDespite its simplicity and versatility, there are nevertheless some negative aspects that should be \n\npointed out, such as the strict relation between differential defecation rates, dietary composition and \n\nsocial patterns; the relevant direct role of environmental conditions on the deterioration and detectability \n\nof traces, and the strong connection between the degree of the observer\u2019s experience and the reliability \n\nof species traces identification (Ferreira 2003; Sim\u00f5es 2010).  \n\nWild rabbit\u2019s fundamental ecological requirements &amp; preferential habitat  \n\nWild rabbit\u2019s presence, abundance and distribution are essentially dependent and related to habitat \n\nstructure, complexity and quality (Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; \n\nVirg\u00f3s et al. 2003), namely landscape features regarding the nature of soil cover. Their most suitable \n\nhabitats should include non-fragmented landscapes with a combination of both open and closed areas, \n\nexhibiting heterogeneous vegetation cover that allow for nutritionally rich food choices and shelter, and \n\nsoft soils with adequate substrates that facilitate the construction of burrows and shelters for refuge \n\npurposes (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n\n2014; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Virg\u00f3s et al. 2003). \n\nHaving stated this, heterogeneous mosaic landscapes, highly abundant within Mediterranean \n\necosystems, are indeed wild rabbit\u2019s preferential habitats (Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; LPN 2014; \n\nSim\u00f5es 2009). These landscapes are composed by complex mixed mosaics of holm and cork-oak \n\nforested areas mingled with shrub patches and scrublands, and opened regions, namely pasturelands and \n\nagricultural areas (Figure 1.8) (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; ICNF 2005; Sim\u00f5es 2010; \n\nVirg\u00f3s et al. 2003).  \n\nIn these mixed habitats, the \n\ntransition between open and closed areas \n\nand the discontinuity in the vegetation is \n\nvital, as it ensures simultaneously the \n\npresence and proximity of the most \n\nfavourable areas for rabbits to find shelter \n\nand protection from predators and/or \n\nadverse (climatic) conditions (within \n\nclosed areas: shrub, scrublands and \n\nforest), as well as to feed (within opened \n\nareas: pastures and agricultural areas, \n\nwith high herbaceous or pasture covers \n\nthat support their diet of grasses and \n\ncereals) (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; ICNF 2005; Sim\u00f5es 2009;  Virg\u00f3s \n\net al. 2003). This spatial interspersion of mosaic areas suitable for rabbits allows them to optimize their \n\nefforts in their search for food resources and minimizes the risk of predation, which is considerably high \n\nespecially within the Iberian Peninsula (Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis \n\n2014). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8 - Mosaic landscape, typical among Mediterranean \n\nhabitats. Adapted from Gon\u00e7alves 2015. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nFactors regulating wild rabbit\u2019s distribution &amp; abundance in Mediterranean regions \n\nWithin the Iberian Peninsula, the wild rabbit\u2019s presence and abundance is mostly affected by a \n\nset of environmental and climatic parameters, such as altitude, slope, type of soil, habitat availability, \n\ndisturbance factors or threats (predators, pathogens and hunters), precipitation rates and temperature \n\n(Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; LPN 2014). Oryctolagus cuniculus tend to be rare \n\nin regions that surpass 1500 m in elevation (Smith &amp; Boyer 2008), having been reported elsewhere that \n\nrabbits usually avoid areas with low temperatures, high precipitation rates and any kind of human dis-\n\nturbance (G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; LPN 2014).  \n\nMost studies concerning rabbit population trends in the Iberian Peninsula are mainly focused on \n\nthe associations between present habitat parameters and recent distribution and abundance of their pop-\n\nulations (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Fern\u00e1ndez 2005). There is an evident lack of information concern-\n\ning the effects of habitat loss on Iberian rabbit populations, being extremely difficult to understand \n\nclearly how landscape changes have affected rabbit populations, and their influence on rabbit popula-\n\ntions\u2019 decline in the Iberian Peninsula (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010). Despite that, there are some studies \n\nthat substantiate the existence of a strong correlation between rabbit distribution and abundance and \n\nsignificant land-use changes over recent decades in Mediterranean regions (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010).  \n\nMain threats associated with wild rabbit populations\u2019 decline in the Iberian Peninsula  \n\nWild rabbit abundance, once significantly high in the Iberian Peninsula, has been suffering an \n\naccentuated decline since the first half of the 20th century (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; ICNF 2005; LPN \n\n2014; Mira et al. 2007; Ward 2005). This delicate situation is mainly due to habitat loss, fragmentation \n\nand deterioration, viral diseases, and high cinegetic pressure (Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; \n\nICNF 2005; Ward 2005). The resultant reduction in rabbit populations has caused a major impairment \n\nof trophic webs, as well as relevant ecological and economic consequences in Mediterranean ecosys-\n\ntems\u2019 functioning (Cabezas-D\u00edaz et al. 2009; Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; ICNF 2005; LPN 2014).  \n\nHabitat deterioration and fragmentation in Mediterranean landscapes are a consequence of the \n\nabandonment of traditional agricultural methods, intensive agriculture, forestry intensification, con-\n\nstruction of urban infrastructures due to socio-economic growth, and recurrent forest fires potentiated \n\nby increasing aridity (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; ICNF 2005; LPN 2014; Ward \n\n2005). These changes in habitat structure and complexity have promoted the decrease and impoverish-\n\nment of the suitability of rabbits\u2019 most favourable heterogeneous mosaic habitats, thus affecting directly \n\nthis species\u2019 presence and abundance (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; ICNF 2005; \n\nSmith &amp; Boyer 2008; Ward 2005). \n\nTwo major viral diseases, Myxomatosis, and Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), emerged in \n\n1953 and 1988 respectively within the Iberian Peninsula, being responsible for high mortality rates and \n\nfor reductions in rabbit populations of approximately 24% in Portugal and of 73% in Spain over the last \n\nthirty years (G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; ICNF 2005; LPN 2014; Virg\u00f3s et al. 2003). In addi-\n\ntion, the European wild rabbit is a very popular game species with a major hunting value, especially in \n\nthe Iberian Peninsula, where rabbit hunting is a very important recreational, social and economic activity \n\n(Delibes-Mateos et al. 2007; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; ICNF 2005; Mira et al. 2007; Mor-\n\ngado 2008; Sim\u00f5es 2009). \n\nNowadays wild rabbit abundances are extremely variable within the Iberian Peninsula, because \n\nof population decline in recent years (Fern\u00e1ndez 2005; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014). \n\nAlthough present throughout the entire Portuguese territory (ICNF 2005), currently their distribution is \n\nhighly fragmented and heterogeneous, favouring the existence of many low-dense areas and fewer areas \n\nstill containing rabbits at a relatively high density (Cabezas-D\u00edaz et al. 2009; Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nGon\u00e7alves 2015; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; ICNF 2005). For this reason, their conservation status \n\nis classified as \u201cNear Threatened\u201d, according to both the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Smith \n\n&amp; Boyer 2008), and the Red Book of Vertebrates of Portugal (ICNF 2005).  \n\nThe wild rabbit as a leading actor in Mediterranean ecosystems \n\nWild rabbits are a fundamental key-species in Mediterranean habitats (Delibes-Mateos et al. \n\n2010; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Mira et al. 2007), due to the significant influence that they have \n\nin such ecosystem structures, functions and dynamics, and to their ecological importance and the mul-\n\ntiplicity of relevant roles they play in these ecosystems (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Delibes-Mateos et \n\nal. 2010; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; Mira et al. 2007). They are impressive ecosystem engi-\n\nneers and a relevant \u2018landscape shaper\u2019, given their significant influence and effects on plant commu-\n\nnities\u2019 composition and vegetation structure, and their extraordinary capacity to produce relevant \n\nchanges in landscapes (Ferreira 2003; Gil-Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2015; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Gon-\n\n\u00e7alves et al. 2014).  \n\nThe rabbit\u2019s herbivorous role promotes seed dispersion of both herbaceous and woody species, \n\nproducing changes within the composition of vegetation communities, thus being very beneficial for \n\ntheir regeneration and the increase of plant populations, and promote the maintenance of opened areas, \n\ncontributing to a more complex and heterogeneous habitat (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Delibes-Mateos \n\net al. 2010; Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015). On the other hand, rabbits\u2019 extraordi-\n\nnary excavator capacity through burrow construction is responsible for producing changes in soil char-\n\nacteristics, and besides burrows provide foraging, shelter and nesting habitats for other species (G\u00e1lvez-\n\nBravo et al. 2009; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014). \n\nMoreover, rabbit pellets\u2019 deposition within latrines and rabbits\u2019 urine are fundamental for soil \n\nfertilisation, plant growth and higher plant species\u2019 diversity and biomass (Cabezas-D\u00edaz et al. 2009; \n\nDelibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015). \n\nThe combination of herbivory, excavating activities and pellet accumulation all contribute to an increase \n\nin the physical heterogeneity of the ecosystem due to exchanges in edaphic conditions, the creation of \n\nwater, nutrients and seed clusters (G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014). \n\nWild rabbits have a vital importance in the Mediterranean ecosystem food chains\u2019 dynamic, in \n\ntheir quality as a basic food resource for a wide variety of top predators (Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n\n2014; Sim\u00f5es 2010). For being a vital food resource for such a broad number of predators, they have a \n\nvery significant influence in predators\u2019 population fluctuations (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Fern\u00e1ndez \n\n2005; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012; Sim\u00f5es 2010). \n\nWithin the Iberian Peninsula, rabbits are indeed the main stable prey of about 40 relevant species \n\nof predators, many of which are emblematic endemic endangered species, some of them being indeed \n\ncritically endangered, such as the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus - Temminck, 1827), the Iberian Imperial \n\neagle (Aquila adalberti - Brehm, 1861), the Black vulture (Aegypius monachus - Linnaeus, 1766), and \n\nthe Bonelli\u2019s eagle (Hieraaetus fasciatus - Vieillot, 1822) (Cabezas-D\u00edaz et al. 2009; Ferreira 2003; \n\nGon\u00e7alves et al. 2012; Loureiro et al. 2011; LPN 2014; Mira et al. 2007). Among these, the Iberian lynx \n\nand Iberian Imperial eagle are indeed specialized in rabbit\u2019s consumption (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; \n\nRodrigues de Barros 2016), being unfortunately highly dependent on rabbits to survive. In this context, \n\nthe wild rabbit\u2019s decline in recent years has posed serious consequences for Iberian lynx populations, \n\ndepriving the lynx from directly interfering in their behaviour, reproduction and long-term survival (Gil-\n\nJim\u00e9nez et al. 2015; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Loureiro et al. 2011; LPN 2014; Mira et al. 2007).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nWild rabbit\u2019s potential as an ecological indicator  \n\nThe wild rabbit is indeed an essential keystone species in Mediterranean ecosystems, especially \n\nin the Iberian Peninsula (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014). \n\nThis is due to the multiplicity of relevant roles and impacts they have within these habitats, in the quality \n\nof relevant ecosystem engineers and as a \u2018landscape shaper\u2019 (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Ferreira 2003; \n\nG\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014). Moreover, they are among the vital base of food chains, \n\nbeing one of the most significant food resources for a considerable set of top predators (Cabezas-D\u00edaz \n\net al. 2009; Fern\u00e1ndez 2005; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; Virg\u00f3s et al. 2003). \n\nGiven the proven relevance of such species within Mediterranean ecosystems and their strict re-\n\nlation and vital roles in habitat structure, quality and complexity, the wild rabbit has all the potential to \n\nbe a good ecological indicator in such ecosystems.  \n\n \n\nFramework and relevance of this study  \n\nThe present work was carried out within the context of the previously mentioned AdaptforChange \n\nProject, a Portuguese Research Project carried out in 2015 and 2016 that aimed to evaluate the success \n\nof reforestations that were implemented in Portuguese historical semi-arid lands.  \n\nReforestation with native species is a vital environmental management tool, as it is an ecological \n\nrestoration method frequently used for degraded ecosystems. The study of the potential of the wild rabbit \n\nas an ecological indicator of ecosystem management, particularly in the context of reforestations with \n\nnative species in Mediterranean drylands, poses a perfect conciliation between two vital Biology aspects, \n\nthe Ecology (wild rabbit &amp; habitat ecology) and the Environmental Management (reforestation with \n\nnative species) ones. \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\nThe present work intends to understand whether the wild rabbit is a good success indicator for \n\nhistorical reforestations in southern Portuguese drylands.  \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n2. GEOGRAPHICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n\n2.1 - Study area characterisation \n\nThe present study was carried out in holm-oak (Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia), cork-oak \n\n(Quercus suber) and stone-pine (Pinus pinea) reforestation areas, located in the southern dryland regions \n\nof continental Portugal (Baixo Alentejo and Algarve - Figure 2.1), southwestern Iberian Peninsula, \n\nEurope. These reforestation actions took place under semi-arid and dry sub-humid climates, over the \n\nlast forty to sixty years.  \n\nThe study area has a typical Mediterranean climate with a strong temperature and rainfall \n\nseasonality, and a high inter-annual variability in precipitation. It is characterized by cold and moist \n\nwinters with strong precipitation periods and very hot, dry summers with scarce precipitation and \n\naverage temperatures above 22\u00baC (Belo et al. 2009). However, due to a considerable increase in aridity \n\nlevels in past decades, nowadays these regions are dominated by semi-arid (Aridity Index between 0.20 \n\nand 0.50) and dry sub-humid climates (Aridity Index from 0.50 to 0.65). These characteristics impose \n\nlimitations to plant species establishment and growth (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Vallejo et al. 2012), which are \n\nexpected to worsen under a climate change scenario of increased aridity and a higher frequency of \n\nextreme events, such as prolonged droughts or seasonal floods (Belo et al. 2009; Costa et al. 2008; \n\nMiranda et al. 2006). \n\nFigure 2.1 - Map illustrating the study area along an aridity gradient.  \n\nThe set of sampling sites is shown here according to the municipalities where \n\nthey are located, and along an aridity gradient from dry sub-humid (AI=0.58) \n\nto semi-arid (AI=0.44). Regions in orange are more arid (lower aridity index). \n\nMap scale 1:880.000. The map was projected using the coordinate system \n\nUTM/ETRS89 Portugal TM06. \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nThe mean annual temperature range within the study area varies between 15-16\u00baC, and the mean \n\nannual rainfall from 519 mm to 616 mm (Nunes et al. 2016a). This area is characterized by an aridity \n\ngradient from dry sub-humid (Aridity Index = 0.58) to semi-arid (Aridity Index = 0.44).  \n\nLithosols are the dominant soil type in these areas, which are impoverished, shallow and unsuit-\n\nable for agricultural purposes, as they result from rock degradation\u2019s first stages (Nunes et al. 2014; \n\nPr\u00edncipe et al. 2014). \n\nSouthern Portuguese drylands have been reforested over past decades with holm-oak, cork-oak \n\nand stone-pine, as a vital strategy to combat desertification and land degradation (Iovieno et al. 2010; \n\nNunes et al. 2016a; Oliet et al. 2015; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014). These species are highly resilient to drought \n\nevents and to precipitation\u2019s seasonal and inter-annual variations (Belo et al. 2009; Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014; \n\nVaz et al. 2010), being therefore often used in reforestation programmes in drylands, especially in west-\n\nern European and northern African Mediterranean regions (Iovieno et al. 2010; Oliet et al. 2015; Pr\u00edn-\n\ncipe et al. 2014). In addition, (re)afforestations are also a critical tool for climate change mitigation \n\n(K\u00f6bel et al. 2017), particularly in areas where its effects are expected to be strong (Costa et al. 2008). \n\n2.2 - Sampling sites\u2019 selection   \n\nSampling sites were chosen within those included in the AdaptforChange Project\u2019s database of \n\nreforestation actions, provided they fulfilled the following criteria: (i) they should be composed of pure \n\nor mixed plantations of the target species - Q. suber, Q. ilex or P. pinea; (ii) have at least ten years of \n\nage since the plantation date (to guarantee planted trees\u2019 establishment, and to prevent the plantation\u2019s \n\nperturbation effect on the ecosystem); and (iii) should be located within a dryland region (exhibiting an \n\naridity index lower than 0.65, along an aridity gradient) (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017).  \n\nAdaptforChange\u2019s research team selected at least four sites of each reforestation type (pure or \n\nmixed plantations of oaks and pines), in a total of 44 sampling sites. For the present study, 23 of these \n\nsites (Table 2.1) were selected for wild rabbit sampling (see Section 2.3), along the previously mentioned \n\naridity gradient, and covering six Portuguese municipalities (Almod\u00f4var, Beja, Castro Verde, and M\u00e9-\n\nrtola in the Alentejo region; Alcoutim and Loul\u00e9 in the Algarve - Figure 2.1).  \n\n \n\n \nType of reforestation Wild rabbit sampling \n\nPure          Q. suber \n\n                  Q. ilex \n\n                  P. pinea \n\n       11  \n\n        2  \n\n        2 \n\nMixed       Q. suber &amp; P. pinea \n\n                 Q. ilex &amp; P. pinea \n\n                 Q. ilex &amp; Q. suber \n\n        3 \n\n        3 \n\n        2 \n\nTotal   23 \n\nTable 2.1 - Wild rabbit sampling sites according to type of reforestation. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n2.3 - Wild rabbit sampling  \n\n2.3.1 - Sampling strategy: rabbit latrines &amp; droppings\u2019 counts along linear transects \n\nFor this study, wild rabbit sampling was carried out through the establishment of pedestrian linear \n\ntransects recording rabbit latrines within reforested areas (Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Gon\u00e7alves et \n\nal. 2014; Sarmento et al. 2004). This presence traces\u2019 prospection method was chosen, since latrine \n\ncounting allows for performing, in a simple, economic and practical way, a comparison of the wild \n\nrabbit\u2019s relative abundance estimates among the set of sampled sites (Fern\u00e1ndez 2005; INCOB 2009, \n\ncited by Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014).  \n\nBecause of the high variability in reforestation parcel sizes, as well as in the areas of the \n\nplantations, it was decided to apply a single linear transect of 250 m per site, to obtain a standardized \n\nsampling (thus assuring abundance estimates\u2019 comparison). However, the location of the transect was \n\nadapted to each site: in larger sites, the transect would be continuous, and in smaller sites, the transect \n\nwas discontinuous.  \n\nTransects\u2019 possible locations in each sampling site were established prior to the field work, using \n\nsoftware Google Earth Pro\u00ae, version 7.1.5.1557 for Windows\u00ae, and these were downloaded to Garmin\u00ae \n\nGPS. This was considered the best way to proceed in order to obtain a reasonably good representation \n\nof the study sites, and the most suitable locations for the sampling transects, since the observer did not \n\nhave a priori knowledge of the study area.    \n\nTo ensure that wild rabbits\u2019 sampling is carried out within or as close as possible to reforestation \n\nstudied parcels, transects must be disposed within or in the proximity of geometrical polygons that are \n\nrepresentative of the most favourable areas to perform vegetation sampling (carried out by the \n\nAdaptforChange Project\u2019s research team - see Section 2.4.1). Moreover, transects should be established \n\npassing through, or as spatially close as possible to, the geometrical centroid of each favorable sampling \n\npolygon, to assure a representative sampling. If it is not possible to establish transects passing through \n\nthe centroids\u2019 location, transects must be carried out as close as possible to the centroid. Polygons\u2019 \n\ngeometrical centroids were determined using QGIS\u00ae software, version 2.12.0 \u2018Lyon\u2019 for Windows\u00ae, and \n\nthe set of representative polygons and respective centroids were downloaded into a Garmin\u00ae GPSMAP \n\n76CSx through software GPS TrackMaker\u00ae, version 13.8.517 for Windows\u00ae. Figure 2.2 shows an \n\nexample of the sampling protocol - wild rabbit latrines\u2019 counting along foot-transects - applied within \n\nreforested areas. \n\nFor each sampling site, transects should be defined along dirt paths, where the soil nature of these \n\ntracks significantly improves traces\u2019 detectability, therefore being ideal for rabbit latrine and droppings\u2019 \n\ncounts (Fern\u00e1ndez 2005; INCOB 2009, cited by Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2 - Field sampling  \n\nWild rabbits\u2019 field sampling was carried out during a unique sampling season, in November and \n\nDecember of 2015. According to Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2002) &amp; Martins et al. (2003), it is highly advisable \n\nto perform rabbit latrines\u2019 counting in at least two different sampling seasons to encompass differential \n\nwild rabbit reproductive biology stages, and consequently variable abundances, namely during the post-\n\nbreeding period when the highest abundance peak occurs (May and June), and if possible also in the \n\nlowest abundance period (late August and September). Moreover, Fernandez-de-Simon et al. (2011) \n\nreinforce that pellet-count indices should be obtained during early Summer, preferably at the start of the \n\ndry season, as a way of reducing as much as possible the biases associated with differences in rabbit \n\npellet persistence because of rainfall effects, especially within Mediterranean habitats.  \n\n Despite all this, and even though November and December are not contemplated as ideal months \n\nto perform wild rabbit latrine counts, it was only possible to execute this sampling method in those \n\nmonths, mainly due to logistic and technical reasons related to some delays in obtaining reforestation \n\nFigure 2.2 - Map illustrating an example of rabbit latrines and \n\npellet counts within one sampling site. Representation of a \n\nsampling point including the plantation polygon, the plot where \n\nvegetation sampling was performed, and the linear transect \n\nperformed for the wild rabbit\u2019s sampling strategy. Map scale 1:3.500. \n\nThe map was projected using the coordinate system UTM/ETRS89 \n\nPortugal TM06. \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\ninformation from the institutions involved within the AdaptforChange Project context, thus delaying the \n\nappropriate selection of sampling sites.1 \n\nFor each sampling site, transects were walked through during daytime, from the early morning \n\n(approximately 8 a.m) until the end of the afternoon (between 5 and 6 p.m), due to higher solar \n\nexposition that significantly improves latrine and droppings\u2019 detectability. While walking transects at a \n\nslow pace, a Garmin\u00ae GPS was used to mark and register points for the beginning and end of each \n\ntransect and every time latrines or other rabbit traces (burrows and/or scratchings) were detected, as well \n\nas to obtain the geographical coordinates for every recorded point and to register the routes walked in \n\nthe field by means of its special tracking option.  \n\nAll the relevant data detected along transects, as well as the areas located up to two meters on \n\neach side of them (to assure that all rabbit traces present along the surroundings of the transect area are \n\naccounted for), was recorded in field sheets (designed prior to the field work, using Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae \n\n2016 MSO, version 16.0.6925.1044 for Windows\u00ae - a template field sheet is presented in the Appendix \n\n- Table 1). A personal photographic camera was used to take photos of the most representative latrines, \n\nand of other relevant traces found along transects, using a small object for scale purposes.  \n\nFor each latrine found, the following information was registered: geographic coordinates; latrine \n\ndimensions (estimated number of pellets and latrine diameter (in cm), using a five-meter long tape \n\nmeasure to perform two consecutive measurements); droppings\u2019 estimated age (three categories based \n\non droppings\u2019 coloration and integrity: very old - whitish-colored, extremely harsh and thick; old - \n\nbetween dark brown and whitish colors, relatively harsh; and recent - intense shiny dark brown color \n\nand soft consistency); dominant land cover in the latrine surroundings (bare soil and/or rocks, dead layer, \n\nshrubby and/or herbaceous plants, lichens, moss, \u2026); other relevant traces, such as other rabbit traces \n\n(burrows, scratchings, hair/fur,\u2026) or from other animals, such as footprints and/or footprint trails, \n\ndroppings, burrows, hair/fur, skeletal remains, among other from wild boars (such as diggings) and/or \n\npredators that are relevant to wild rabbits\u2019 presence, or that could explain their absence; and finally, \n\nspecial or unusual features or events, such as evidences of rabbit viral diseases, thinning, forest fires, \n\namong any other factors capable of producing changes in wild rabbits\u2019 presence, mainly inhibiting it \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014). \n\nTransects\u2019 a priori establishment were confirmed and/or altered at the time of sampling according \n\nto environmental and accessibility conditions in each sampling site. In some sampling sites, it was not \n\npossible to walk transects through the centroid, either due to inaccessible paths that exhibited high shrub \n\ndensities and/or physical obstacles, and significant steepness, and/or due to the absence of the most \n\nsuitable paths for latrine counting purposes within or close to the centroid area. In these cases, transects \n\nwere established in the most suitable paths as spatially close as possible to the respective centroids. In \n\nthe absence of appropriate dirt paths within the sampling area, a decision was made to walk transects \n\ndirectly through the plantation lines and interlines, covering the centroids\u2019 location or as close as \n\npossible to them. This decision was due to the high detectability of rabbit evidences verified at the time \n\nof sampling, such as latrines and burrows present along plantation lines\u2019 terrain elevations.  \n\nLand owners and managers were approached in study sites, whenever possible, to understand the \n\npossible influence of pathology events associated to viral diseases (myxomatosis and rabbit \n\nhaemorrhagic disease), and management actions (game activity, forest thinning, fires, among other \n\nfactors), that may affect wild rabbits\u2019 abundance. This constitutes an effective way to complement and \n\nreinforce wild rabbit abundance data obtained during field samplings. \n\n                                                      \n1 Despite the strong recommendation in favour of executing rabbits\u2019 sampling protocol in at least two different sampling \n\nseasons, the author was only able to carry it out in a single sampling season, due to unexpected health and personal issues that \n\nunfortunately prevented the accomplishment of a second sampling season.  \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n2.4 - Characterization of reforestations by AdaptforChange\u2019s research team \n\nSince the present work was carried out within reforested sites in the framework of the National \n\nResearch Project AdaptforChange, and since it is intended to determine whether the wild rabbit is indeed \n\na good success indicator of reforestations using reforestation-related variables in the analysis of wild \n\nrabbit data, a brief description of the methodologies applied for the characterization of reforestations is \n\ngiven below.  \n\nWithin each sampling site, two researchers of the AdaptforChange Project\u2019s research team \n\ncharacterised tree, shrub and herbaceous layers, soil crusts, soil and climate features to assess relevant \n\necosystem parameters, namely tree and herbaceous diversity and productivity, natural tree regeneration, \n\nsoil quality and habitat structural diversity. These parameters were chosen since they reflect forest \n\nproductivity and sustainability, soil protection, and biodiversity, which are vital ecosystem functions \n\nand objectives of reforestations. The reforestation features that were studied allowed for the evaluation \n\nof the establishment and growth of planted trees, as well as the resultant ecosystems from reforestation \n\nactions (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). Vegetation and a part of soil data were obtained \n\nthroughout field work in the sampled sites in November and December of 2015, whilst climatic and part \n\nof soil information were extracted from available databases (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017). \n\nThe information regarding vegetation\u2019s structure and complexity, soil and climate features of the \n\nstudied reforestations, which represent indicators of the success of reforestations, will be used to \n\nunderstand whether it influences (or not) wild rabbits\u2019 presence and abundance in the study area, as it is \n\nknown that habitat structure and complexity (vegetation and soil structure), and climate factors play \n\nvital roles in rabbit nutritional and shelter availability and affect their habitat suitability. This will \n\nhopefully allow us to determine if the wild rabbit is indeed a good ecological indicator of the success of \n\nreforestations.  \n\n2.4.1 - Definition of sampling plots for vegetation and soil sampling \n\nAt each sampling site, vegetation and soil were characterised within a sampling plot with 1000 \n\nm2 (0,1 ha) defined to encompass 3 plantation inter-lines (Figure 2.3). Reforestation sampling plots were \n\ndefined within, or as close as possible to, geometrical polygons that are representative of the most \n\nsuitable areas for vegetation sampling, which were designed prior to the field work for each sampling \n\nsite using software Google Earth Pro\u00ae, version 7.1.5.1557 for Windows\u00ae. Taking into consideration the \n\n(possible) high variability within the same reforestation area due to microclimatic conditions, sampling \n\nplots were defined within areas that present similar solar exposition (Potential Solar Radiation 1294430 \n\n\u00b1 96285 KW/m2) to limit such variability (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Example of a sampling area for vegetation sampling including 3 plantation lines, with an area of \n\n1000 m2.

Adapted from K\u00f6bel et al. 2017 and Nunes et al. 2016a. \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n2.4.2 - Vegetation sampling: trees, shrubs &amp; herbaceous features \n\nTrees \n\nThe total number of trees present within the sampling plot was registered, as well as the presence \n\nof cut trees (resultant from thinning actions), dead trunks and non-planted adult trees. Tree height was \n\nmeasured using a hypsometer. For about ? of the planted pines and \u00bd of the planted oaks (since there \n\nwas a higher homogeneity of growth among pine trees than oaks), diameter at breast height (DBH) and \n\ncanopy diameters were measured. Current and historical tree productivity was estimated by the NDVI \n\n(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), having extracted NDVI\u2019s lowest annual value that occurs \n\nduring summer when annual plants are dry, which reflects perennial species\u2019 productivity (K\u00f6bel et al. \n\n2017; Nunes et al. 2016a).  \n\nShrubs cover and diversity, bare soil cover and natural tree regeneration \n\nFor each sampling plot, shrub diversity and cover and the proportion of bare soil were estimated \n\nalong three transects with lengths varying between 21.7 and 37.2 m. Shrub diversity (species richness) \n\nwas estimated through the identification of all shrub species present along the transects, whereas shrub \n\ncover (%) was assessed based on the proportion of each transect covered by shrubs. If no vegetation was \n\npresent, the cover of bare soil and of biological soil crust (%) were registered. Natural tree regeneration \n\nwas estimated by counting and measuring heights and canopy diameters of all seedlings and saplings \n\npresent within a one-square-meter area along transects (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a).   \n\nHerbaceous cover and productivity \n\nHerbaceous cover was estimated based on photographs of four 50 x 50 cm quadrats, 2 in planta-\n\ntion lines and 2 between lines, estimating the proportion of herbaceous plants by counting green pixels \n\nusing ArcGIS software. To estimate herbaceous productivity, 3 samples of herbaceous aboveground \n\nbiomass were collected within a 30 x 30 cm square along plantation lines to prevent inter-lines\u2019 varia-\n\nbility. This biomass was then dried and weighted, to obtain dry biomass weight and calculate the bio-\n\nmass produced per hectare (K\u00f6bel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a).   \n\n2.4.3 - Climate characterization  \n\nAs previously mentioned, climate factors, such as Aridity Index, as well as bio-type climatic \n\nvariables, such as Annual Mean Temperature (bio_1), Temperature Seasonality (bio_4), Annual Mean \n\nPrecipitation (bio_12), Precipitation Seasonality (bio_15), Isothermality (bio_3), Temperature Annual \n\nRange (bio_7), among others, were obtained from available databases (Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do \n\nAmbiente 2011; Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera 2016; Trabucco &amp; Zomer 2009, all cited by \n\nK\u00f6bel et al. 2017).  \n\n2.5 - Data organization &amp; analysis \n\n2.5.1 - Wild rabbits\u2019 data assembly, organization &amp; analysis  \n\nWild rabbit\u2019s data obtained during field sampling was typed into a database in Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae \n\n2016 MSO, version 16.0.6925.1044 for Windows\u00ae. Rabbit latrines and pellets\u2019 data allowed to obtain \n\nthe following parameters: total number of latrines; latrines\u2019 diameter (in cm); pellets\u2019 average number \n\n(within each latrine); and pellets\u2019 estimated age.  \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nLatrines\u2019 average diameter consists of a latrines\u2019 size index calculated for each sampled site, \n\nwhich was obtained using latrines\u2019 average diameter classes. Latrines\u2019 diameters measured during field \n\nsampling were organized within four latrines\u2019 average diameter classes: 1 - [5-30] cm; 2 - [30-60] cm; \n\n3 - [60-100] cm; 4 - [100-200] cm. For each class we put the total number of latrines whose diameter \n\nbelongs to that class. Those values were then multiplied by the highest limit value of the diameter class \n\nwhere they belong, and the resulting average of such values corresponds to the size index for latrines\u2019 \n\naverage diameters that will be used as a rabbit variable in this study.  \n\nIn the same way, pellets\u2019 average number consists of a quantity index obtained for each sampled \n\nsite, considering five classes created according to the number of estimated pellets within each latrine \n\nfound at the time of sampling: 1 - [20-50] pellets; 2 - [50-200] pellets; 3 - [200-400] pellets; 4 - [400-\n\n750] pellets; 5 - [750-2000] pellets. In each class are the total number of latrines whose estimated number \n\nof pellets belongs to that class. Such values were then multiplied by the highest limit value of the average \n\nnumber class where they belong, and the resulting average of such values corresponds to the quantity \n\nindex for the estimated number of pellets, which will be used as another rabbit variable for this work.  \n\nPellets\u2019 estimated age is a numerical category based on droppings\u2019 degradation state (color and \n\nintegrity) at the time of sampling: 1 - very old and old; 2 - old; 3 - old and recent.  \n\nA brief characterization of the linear transects carried out to perform wild rabbit sampling, as well \n\nas latrines\u2019 average diameter classes and pellets\u2019 average number classes are presented respectively in \n\nTables 2, 3 and 4 in the Appendix. \n\n2.5.2 - Determination of wild rabbits\u2019 relative abundance \n\nTo obtain an estimation of wild rabbit relative abundance within the sampling sites, a Kilometric \n\nAbundance Index (KAI) has been calculated. KAI was obtained as the ratio between the number of wild \n\nrabbits\u2019 presence signs detected (total number of latrines) and the transects\u2019 length (converted into \n\nkilometres) (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; INCOB 2009, cited by Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Sim\u00f5es \n\n2009). The calculation of KAI for each sampling point allows for comparisons of rabbits\u2019 relative \n\nabundance among different sampling sites (Wilson et al. 1996, cited by Mira et al. 2007).   \n\n2.5.3 - Integration of reforestation-related variables within the wild rabbit database  \n\nWithin all the reforestation data obtained, an a priori choice of variables was performed aiming \n\nto integrate in rabbits\u2019 database solely the ones that presumably influence wild rabbits\u2019 presence and \n\nabundance in the study area. Such variables were selected to test a possible influence in wild rabbits at \n\nthe sampled sites. In the context of the present work, these variables are considered as indicators of the \n\nsuccess of reforestations. A-posteriori analysis of the relationships between wild rabbit variables and \n\nthe environmental ones (chosen from the set of reforestation-related variables) will hopefully allow us \n\nto find out whether the rabbit can be a good success indicator of reforestation actions in Portuguese \n\ndrylands.  \n\nSelected environmental variables - indicators of the success of reforestations - were related to \n\ntrees (type of reforestation; reforestation dominant type; Pinus pinea presence; planted tree species\u2019 \n\ncover (%); trees\u2019 density, height and diameter at breast height (DBH); canopy openness; plantation \n\nestimated age); tree regeneration (number of juvenile trees - seedlings and saplings); shrubs (number of \n\nshrub species with and without seedlings; shrub cover (%) and average height; shrub\u2019s spatial \n\ndistribution); herbaceous plants (herbaceous and moss cover (%); herbaceous biomass); soil (type of \n\nsoil; bare soil cover (%); bare soil &amp; rock cover (%); steepness); and finally climate features (aridity \n\nindex; annual mean temperature; temperature seasonality; annual mean precipitation; precipitation of \n\nthe wettest month), as it is known that habitat and landscape features are very important to explain rabbit \n\ndistribution and abundance (e.g. Virg\u00f3s et al. 2003).  \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n2.5.4 - Spatial organization of wild rabbit data in the Geographic Information System \n\nFurthermore, the previously obtained geometrical polygons and respective centroids, alongside \n\nall recorded points and walked routes registered within the GPS, were integrated in a Geographic \n\nInformation System (GIS) using QGIS\u00ae software to later perform the necessary corrections to walked \n\nroutes in the field, and integrate such spatial information into maps.  \n\nMoreover, maps illustrating the study area, as well as the wild rabbit's sampling strategy and \n\nrelative abundance (Kilometric Abundance Index) have been created using ArcMap\u00ae from ArcGIS\u00ae \n\nmapping software, version 10.6 for Windows\u00ae. For the map regarding the study area, a color gradient \n\nwas used to illustrate the aridity gradient present throughout the set of sampling sites, whereas for the \n\nmap concerning the wild rabbit\u2019s Kilometric Abundance Index, a size gradient was used to stand for \n\ndifferent KAI values according to each sampling site. \n\n2.6 - Data analysis  \n\n2.6.1 - Histograms and correlations \n\nFor each variable, histograms were obtained to understand the behavior and distribution of each \n\nvariable. Histograms were designed using package \u2018graphics\u2019 (R Core Team and contributors \n\nworldwide, 2018a) within software R\u00ae - version 3.4.3 \u201cKite-Eating Tree\u201d for Windows\u00ae (R Core Team, \n\n2017).  \n\nThe relations between continuous variables, such as the wild rabbit ones and the indicators of the \n\nsuccess of reforestations (measured reforestation parameters) and climatic data were tested with \n\nSpearman correlations, with IBM SPSS Statistics Base\u00ae software - version 22.0.0.0 for Windows\u00ae (IBM \n\nCorp., 2013). Correlations were considered significant whenever the associated p-value was below 0.05 \n\nsignificance level, and very significant if p-value was below 0.01. For those variables exhibiting \n\nsignificant and very significant correlations, scatter plots were done for each pair of strongly correlated \n\nvariables, using package \u2018graphics\u2019 (R Core Team and contributors worldwide, 2018a) from software \n\nR\u00ae - version 3.4.3 \u201cKite-Eating Tree\u201d for Windows\u00ae (R Core Team, 2017).  \n\n2.6.2 - Analysis of variance  \n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to test the effects of: reforestation dominant type \n\n(Quercus suber, Quercus ilex or Pinus pinea); Pinus presence; shrubs\u2019 spatial distribution; and finally \n\nsoil type on each wild rabbit variable (total number of latrines; Kilometric Abundance Index; latrines\u2019 \n\ndiameter; average number of pellets; and pellets\u2019 estimated age). Whenever results were different among \n\ngroups (if the associated p-value was below 0.05), significant differences between certain groups were \n\ntested with Tukey post-hoc tests.  \n\nOne-way ANOVA analysis, as well as Tukey post-hoc testes, were designed with resource to \n\npackage \u2018stats\u2019 (R Core Team and contributors worldwide, 2018b), whilst representative box-plots were \n\nobtained using package \u2018graphics\u2019 (R Core Team and contributors worldwide, 2018a), all from software \n\nR\u00ae - version 3.4.3 \u201cKite-Eating Tree\u201d for Windows\u00ae (R Core Team, 2017). In the results presented \n\nafterwards, \u201cns\u201d stands for non-significant results, significant results are marked with \u201c*\u201d if the p-value \n\nwas below 0.05, and with \u201c**\u201d whenever the associated p-value was below 0.01.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n2.7 - Buffers and land use cartography of sampling sites \n\nThe area surrounding each sampling site was mapped to understand how the composition and \n\nstructure of the landscape influence the presence and abundance of the wild rabbit in the study area. For \n\nthis, polygons delimiting the total plantation areas were drawn using software Google Earth Pro\u00ae, \n\nversion 7.3.1.4507 for Windows\u00ae, in which vegetation and soil sampling plots were set up. The resulting \n\npolygons\u2019 file was later converted to shapefile format (.shp) to be used in ArcGIS\u00ae software, using \n\nArcMap\u00ae 10.6, version 10.6 for Windows\u00ae. \n\nFor each one of the sampling sites, buffers were constructed within a range of 250 meters around \n\nthe polygons of the total plantation areas, as well as around the linear transects that were previously \n\nmapped. The decision to construct buffers for the linear transects (in addition to the plantation buffers) \n\nwas taken because, in some of the sampling sites, the transects were either partially or totally outside \n\nthe limit of the polygons that are representative of the plantations studied. Therefore, to obtain only a \n\ntotal area (a final buffer) representative of each sampling point, a \u201cmerge\u201d of the transect and plantation \n\nbuffers was carried out. For each final buffer, a cartography was elaborated at the level of soil occupation \n\nand use, focusing to a greater degree on the types of vegetation cover, the presence of water, and signs \n\nof human presence and occupation. The main land-use classes include: montados (dominated by pastures \n\nor by brushwoods), brushwoods, meadows and pastures, Pinus or Quercus plantations (either dominated \n\nby pastures, or by brushwoods), paved roads, houses and orchards, infrastructures (in use), ruins and \n\nabandoned wells, and water masses. The buffers, as well as all the cartography, were executed using \n\nArcMap\u00ae 10.6 from ArcGIS\u00ae software, version 10.6 for Windows\u00ae. \n\nOnce the land-use cartography for all the sampling sites was concluded, the total areas and \n\nrespective percentages of each of the land-use classes and for each sampling site were calculated, using \n\nArcMap\u00ae 10.6 from ArcGIS\u00ae software, version 10.6 for Windows\u00ae. \n\nThe relations between the calculated areas and respective percentages for each land-use class and \n\nwild rabbit variables were tested once again with Spearman correlations, using IBM SPSS Statistics \n\nBase\u00ae software - version 22.0.0.0 for Windows\u00ae (IBM Corp., 2013). Correlations were considered \n\nsignificant whenever the associated p-value was below 0.05 significance level, and very significant if p-\n\nvalue was below 0.01. For those variables showing significant and very significant correlations, scatter \n\nplots were made for each pair of strongly correlated variables, using Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae 2016 MSO, \n\nversion 16.0.6925.1044 for Windows\u00ae. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS  \n\n3.1 - Characterisation of sampling sites \n\nIn the study area, sampling sites were either carried out within cork-oak (Quercus suber), holm-\n\noak (Quercus ilex) and stone-pine (Pinus pinea) pure or mixed reforestations. When considering mixed \n\nreforestations of the previously referred species, there can be a significant variability concerning tree \n\nspecies\u2019 densities. In this work, reforestations were analysed considering the dominant tree species \n\n(>50% of present trees) and secondary species (<50%), as shown in Table 3.1.  \n\n \n\nWild rabbit sampling sites were predominantly within Quercus suber dominant pure plantations \n\n(a total of 11 sampling sites), followed by two Quercus ilex dominant pure plantations and two Pinus \n\npinea dominant pure plantations. In general, we can say that plantations dominated by Quercus suber \n\nwere the most studied ones (12 sampling sites), followed by seven sampling sites whose plantations \n\nwere dominated by Pinus pinea, which makes Quercus ilex the least studied reforestation species, \n\npresent as a dominant species in only four sampling sites.  \n\nWhen analysing pure plantations, Quercus suber was the overall dominant species, since it was \n\npresent as a pure reforestation species in 11 sampling sites, followed by Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea, \n\nwhich were both only present in a total of two sampling sites, each as a pure plantation.  \n\nIf considering mixed plantations, the dominant ones were composed by Pinus pinea, which was \n\npresent as a dominant species with Q. ilex in three sampling sites, followed by Pinus pinea dominant \n\ntype with Q. suber present in only two sampling sites. After mixed plantations dominated by Pinus \n\npinea, we have mixed plantations dominated by Q. ilex, which were mixed with Q. suber in two \n\nsampling sites; however, there were no sampling sites within Q. ilex dominant plantations with P. pinea. \n\nAlthough Quercus suber was the overall dominant species present within pure plantations, it was \n\nnevertheless the least representative one as a dominant species among mixed plantations, as it was only \n\npresent as a dominant species with Pinus pinea in one sampling site.  \n\nA general characterisation of the plantations that were studied in each sampling site was \n\nperformed regarding each plantation\u2019s total area (in hectares), reforestation type (pure or mixed \n\nplantation and planted species), and dominant species present within each plantation (Quercus suber, \n\nQuercus ilex or Pinus pinea) (Table 3.2).  \n\n    Wild rabbit \n\nType of reforestation  sampling sites \n\nDominated by pure 2 \n\nQ. ilex with Q. suber 2 \n\n with P. pinea 0 \n\n  4 \n\nDominated by pure 11 \n\nQ. suber with P. pinea 1 \n\n  12 \n\nDominated by pure 2 \n\nP. pinea with Q. ilex 3 \n\n with Q. suber 2 \n\n  7 \n\nTotal  23 \n\nTable 3.1 - Number of sampling sites carried out for wild rabbit sampling per reforestation dominant type (>50%). \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 - Number of sampling sites where wild rabbit sampling \n\nwas carried out, according to each dominant type of reforestation. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nFrom a general perspective, the plantation areas are quite variable, and sampling sites were mostly \n\npresent within pure plantations (in a total of 15 plantations), mainly composed by Quercus suber (11 \n\nsampling sites), followed by two sampling sites present in Q. ilex pure plantations, and one sampling \n\nsite within a P. pinea pure plantation. Among the eight mixed plantations, P. pinea was clearly the \n\ndominant species, as it was present as a dominant species within five sampling sites, whereas Q. ilex \n\nwas only dominant in two mixed plantations, and Q. suber was the least dominant species, present in \n\nonly one sampling site carried out in mixed plantations.  \n\n3.2 - Wild rabbit sampled sites \n\n3.2.1 - Characterisation of linear transects  \n\nIn this work, a total of 23 sampling sites were surveyed, covering six Portuguese municipalities, \n\nin which 36 linear foot-transects were walked to carry out wild rabbit traces\u2019 prospections. The number \n\nof transects that were walked was variable among different reforestation dominant types, which had the \n\nhighest values among reforestations dominated by Quercus suber and by Pinus pinea (Table 3.3). \n\nAlcoutim and Almod\u00f4var municipalities were the most represented ones in which higher numbers of \n\nsampling sites and linear transects were performed, since a total of eight sampling sites were in \n\n \n\nSampling Plantation Pure or mixed Dominant \n\nsite area (ha) plantation &amp; species species \n\nF1 13.4 mixed - P. pinea + Q. suber P. pinea \n\nF7 3.8 mixed - Q. ilex + Q. suber Q. ilex \n\nF19 2.3 pure - Q. ilex Q. ilex \n\nF22 6.2 pure - P. pinea P. pinea \n\nF23 1.9 mixed -  P. pinea + Q. ilex P. pinea \n\nF25 55.6 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF26 3.3 mixed - P. pinea + Q. ilex P. pinea \n\nF27 3.3 pure - P. pinea P. pinea \n\nF28 16.4 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF33 50.7 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF36 29.9 pure - Q. ilex Q. ilex \n\nF37 45.9 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF38 1.7 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF39 2.1 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF40 3.8 mixed - Q. suber + P. pinea Q. suber \n\nF42 7.5 mixed - Q. ilex + Q. suber Q. ilex \n\nF47 22.7 mixed - P. pinea + Q. ilex P. pinea \n\nF58 26.6 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF60 2.3 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF70 5.9 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF71 6.1 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF72 37.1 pure - Q. suber Q. suber \n\nF74 6.9 mixed - P. pinea + Q. suber P. pinea \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - Characterisation of Quercus suber, Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea plantations studied, according to each \nsampling site. \n\nTable 3.2 - Characterisation of Quercus suber, Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea \n\nplantations studied, according to each sampling site. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nAlcoutim, in which 14 transects were walked; seven sampling sites and 11 transects were walked in \n\nAlmod\u00f4var (see Table 2 in Appendix).  \n\nFor the sampling sites where it was not possible to perform a continuous transect of 250 meters \n\nfor rabbit sampling (due to spatial limitations related to the size of reforestation parcels), smaller transects \n\nwere carried out to cover the total distance required for the sampling. The number of sampling sites in \n\nwhich respectively one and two linear transects were walked was the same (11 sampling sites for each), \n\na total of three transects for one sampling site was carried out (see Table 2 in Appendix). \n\nSince it was not always possible to walk transects along dirt tracks, either due to spatial limitations \n\nwithin some reforestation parcels or to the absence of the most suitable tracks for latrines\u2019 and pellets\u2019 \n\ncounts, the observer decided to carry out some transects directly through plantation lines and/or \n\ninterlines, as previously mentioned. A total of ten transects were walked in dirt tracks, from a total of \n\neight sampling sites, whereas 15 transects were walked directly along plantation lines and/or interlines \n\nin a total of ten sampled sites. A total of 11 transects were walked both in dirt tracks and along plantation \n\nlines/interlines in a total of five sampling sites (see Table 2 in Appendix). \n\n \n\n3.2.2 - Wild rabbit sampling strategy \n\n \n\n In this work, a total of 23 Quercus suber, Quercus ilex and/or Pinus pinea plantations were \n\nsampled, in which a total of 372 latrines were detected within 20 sampling sites (Figure 3.1). For each \n\nsampling site, a total of 16 latrines were detected on average.   \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 - Number of transects walked according to dominant type of reforestation, and \n\nnumber of sampling sites within each reforestation type. \n\n \n  Number of Number of \n\nType of reforestation  transects walked sampling sites \n\nDominated by pure 3 2 \n\nQ. ilex with Q. suber 3 2 \n\n with P. pinea 0 0 \n\n  6 4 \n\nDominated by pure 15 11 \n\nQ. suber with P. pinea 2 1 \n\n  17 12 \n\nDominated by pure 4 2 \n\nP. pinea with Q. ilex 6 3 \n\n with Q. suber 3 2 \n\n  13 7 \n\nTotal  36 23 \n\nTable 3.3 - Number of transects walked according to reforestation dominant type and number of sampling sites \nwithin each reforestation type. \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\nA total of 76 latrines were found along dirt tracks alone, whilst 215 latrines were found along \n\nplantation lines/interlines, and 81 latrines were detected in sampling sites where transects were carried \n\nout along both dirt tracks and plantation lines/interlines. Interestingly, the highest number of latrines \n\nwere not found along dirt tracks, but instead along plantations\u2019 lines/inter-lines within sampling sites. \n\nDirt tracks alone were indeed the ones where the lowest number of latrines was detected (see Table 2 in \n\nAppendix).    \n\nAs mentioned earlier, a total of 36 transects were walked within the set of sampling sites. From \n\nthese, 32 transects had positive results (all 372 wild rabbit latrines having been found), whilst the \n\nremaining 4 transects had a negative result in which rabbit latrines were not detected. This means that \n\n89% of transects had positive results (where latrines were found), while only 11% were negative \n\n(latrines\u2019 absence).  \n\nThe highest number of latrines detected was within reforestations dominated by Pinus pinea and \n\nQuercus suber respectively, particularly in pure Q. suber dominant reforestations and in reforestations \n\ndominated by P. pinea, within P. pinea and Q. ilex mixed plantations.

As previously stated, sampled sites exhibiting higher \n\npellets\u2019 quantity indexes are indeed the ones where more latrines were detected.  \n\n \n\nFor each latrine found, pellets\u2019 approximate age was estimated based on pellets\u2019 colour and \n\nintegrity at the time of sampling, and a pellets\u2019 estimated age index was obtained. Pellets within the \n\ncategory \u2018old and recent\u2019 were the most representative ones, found within a total of 205 latrines, \n\nfollowed by the category \u2018very old and old\u2019 within 145 latrines, and finally the category \u2018old\u2019 as the \n\nleast represented one, with only 22 latrines found in which pellets corresponded to that category.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Representation of latrines\u2019 size index (average diameters within pre-estab-\n\nlished average diameter classes) per sampling sites. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Representation of pellets\u2019 quantity index (pellets\u2019 average number within each \n\nlatrine found in pre-established pellets\u2019 estimated number classes) per sampling sites. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nWild rabbits\u2019 relative abundance \n\nAs previously mentioned, in this work the wild rabbit\u2019s relative abundance was obtained through \n\nthe calculation of a Kilometric Abundance Index (KAI), using the total number of latrines found within \n\neach sampling site and the total distance covered that was required for this sampling, converted into km \n\n(250 meters, either carried out in one transect, or more if necessary to complete the required distance). \n\nWithin the study area, the higher values for the Kilometric Abundance Index were found in a total of 9 \n\nsampling sites, ranging from 128 to 268 latrines per km. Kilometric Abundance Index values for the \n\nwild rabbit in the study area are presented in Figure 3.4. Figure 3.5 gives us a general idea of how the \n\nKilometric Abundance Index varies among the set of sampling sites. In Table 3.5 are the main results \n\nregarding wild rabbit latrines and pellets\u2019 counts.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n Figure 3.5 - Map illustrating the variability of the wild rabbit\u2019s \n\nKilometric Abundance Index among the set of sampling sites. \n\nKAI values were organized into different abundance classes.

In the results presented \n\nafterwards, \u201cns\u201d stands for non-significant results, significant results are marked with \u201c*\u201d if the associ-\n\nated p-value was below 0.05, and with \u201c**\u201d whenever the associated p-value was below 0.01. \n\nCorrelation results between the set of wild rabbit variables studied show that they are all signifi-\n\ncantly related with each other. These variables are strongly correlated with each other, since their asso-\n\nciated p-values were always below 0.01, as presented in Table 3.6.

Moreover, there seems to be a strong relation between the \n\naverage number of pellets and latrines\u2019 average diameter (r=0.962; p<0.01). As for pellets\u2019 estimated \n\nage, it was more strongly related to pellets\u2019 average number (r=0.627; p=0.001). \n\n \n\n3.2.4 - Relationships between wild rabbit variables and indicators of the success of reforestations\n\n  \n\nCorrelations  \n\nIn this section we present tables that encompass the main results of Spearman correlations ob-\n\ntained between the set of wild rabbit variables with the indicators of the success of reforestations previ-\n\nously mentioned (vegetation structure and complexity) and other abiotic variables such as soil, topogra-\n\nphy and climatic variables.  \n\nThe tables below include Spearman correlation coefficient values (r) for the correlations obtained \n\nbetween the variables previously referred to. In the results presented afterwards, \u201cns\u201d stands for non-\n\nsignificant results, significant results are marked with \u201c*\u201d if the associated p-value was below 0.05, and \n\nwith \u201c**\u201d whenever the associated p-value was below 0.01.  \n\nThe correlations between wild rabbit variables and the indicators of the success of reforestations, \n\nparticularly the ones related to the tree layer and to shrubby and herbaceous layers (under canopy con-\n\nditions), are presented below in Table 3.7.  \n\nIt is possible to state that tree height\u2019s standard deviation for all tree species present within the \n\nstudied reforestations is inversely related to the set of wild rabbit variables; pellets\u2019 estimated age and \n\nlatrines\u2019 average diameter are the most affected ones (for pellets\u2019 estimated age: r=-0.525, p=0.010; for \n\nlatrines\u2019 average diameter: r=-0.523, p=0.010). In fact, this was the only strong correlation verified for \n\npellets\u2019 estimated age. On the other hand, pellets\u2019 average number was negatively influenced by shrub \n\nspecies richness, either without considering or including Quercus suber seedlings (without seedlings: \n\nr=-0.492, p=0.017; including Oak seedlings: r=-0.505, p=0.014), followed by latrines\u2019 average diameter \n\n(without seedlings: r=-0.463, p=0.026; including Quercus spp. seedlings: r=-0.479, p=0.021). Moreover, \n\npellets\u2019 average number seems to be the most negatively influenced by herbaceous and moss cover (r=-\n\n0.534, p=0.009), as well as latrines\u2019 average diameter (r=-0.506, p=0.014). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n NumLat   KAI NumPellets DiamLat PelletsAge \n\nNumber of latrines 1.000     \n\nKilometric Abundance Index 1.000** 1.000    \n\nPellets\u2019 average number 0.938** 0.938** 1.000   \n\nLatrines\u2019 average diameter 0.972** 0.972** 0.962** 1.000  \n\nPellets\u2019 estimated age 0.592** 0.592** 0.627** 0.611** 1.000 \n\nTable 3.6 - Spearman correlations between wild rabbit variables. \u2018ns\u2019 no significant correlation; \u2018*\u2019 significant for \np<0.05; \u2018**\u2019 highly significant for p<0.01. \n\nTable 3.6 - Spearman correlations between the set of wild rabbit variables. \u2018ns\u2019 no significant correlation; \n\n\u2018*\u2019 significant for p<0.05; \u2018**\u2019 highly significant for p<0.01. \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe correlations between wild rabbit variables and the indicators of the success of reforestations, \n\nspecifically the ones regarding soil, topography and climatic parameters, are presented below in Table \n\n3.8.  \n\nThe number of latrines and Kilometric Abundance Index are particularly affected by the content \n\nof soil organic matter (r=-0.439; p=0.036), followed by latrines\u2019 average diameter (r=-0.423; p=0.044). \n\nPellets\u2019 average number and estimated age, on the other hand, were not (significantly) affected. As for \n\ntopography, only latrines\u2019 average diameter was strongly influenced by high altitude (r=-0.462; \n\np=0.030). Concerning climate features, wild rabbit variables seem to be affected by different factors. \n\nLatrines\u2019 average diameter was the most significantly affected by higher aridity indexes (r= -0.486, \n\np=0.019), followed by pellets\u2019 average number (r=-0.420, p=0.046). Latrines\u2019 average diameter, as well \n\nas number of latrines and Kilometric Abundance Index, were positively correlated with annual mean \n\ntemperature (latrines\u2019 average diameter: r=0.472, p=0.023; number of latrines and KAI: r=0.445, \n\np=0.033), and with temperature seasonality (latrines\u2019 average diameter: r=0.517, p=0.014; number of \n\nlatrines and KAI: r=0.444, p=0.038). Pellets\u2019 average number was also promoted by temperature sea-\n\nsonality (r=0.489, p=0.021). On the other hand, both latrines\u2019 average diameter, number of latrines and \n\nKAI were inversely related to annual mean precipitation (for latrines\u2019 average diameter: r=-0.476, \n\np=0.022; for number of latrines and KAI: r=-0.465, p=0.025). Furthermore, latrines\u2019 average diameter \n\nwas the only one strongly related in a negative way with the precipitation of the wettest month (r=-\n\n0.435, p=0.043).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  NumLat KAI DiamLat NumPellets PelletsAge \n\nTree layer Tree height          \n\n (standard deviation) -0.514* -0.514* -0.523* -0.429* -0.525* \n\nUnder canopy Shrub species richness -0.422* -0.422* -0.463* -0.492* ns \n\nconditions Shrub species richness      \n\n  (w/Oak seedlings)      -0.439* -0.439* -0.479* -0.505* ns \n\n Herbaceous and      \n\n moss cover (%) -0.480* -0.480* -0.506* -0.534** ns \n\nTable 3.7 - Spearman correlations between wild rabbit variables and vegetation complexity and structure variables. \n\u2018ns\u2019 no significant correlation; \u2018*\u2019 significant for p<0.05; \u2018**\u2019 highly significant for p<0.01. \n\n \n\nTable 3.7 - Spearman correlations between the set of wild rabbit variables and indicators of the success of \n\nreforestations (vegetation complexity and structure variables). \u2018ns\u2019 no significant correlation; \u2018*\u2019 significant \n\nfor p<0.05; \u2018**\u2019 highly significant for p<0.01. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  NumLat KAI DiamLat NumPellets PelletsAge \n\nSoil Organic matter content (%) -0.439* -0.439* -0.423* ns ns \n\nTopography Altitude ns ns -0.462* ns ns \n\nClimate Aridity index ns ns -0.486* -0.420* ns \n\n Annual mean temp. 0.445* 0.445* 0.472* ns ns \n\n Temp. seasonality 0.444* 0.444* 0.517* 0.489* ns \n\n Annual mean precip. -0.465* -0.465* -0.476* ns ns \n\n Precip. of the wettest month ns ns -0.435* ns ns \n\nTable 3.8 - Spearman correlations between wild rabbit variables with soil, topography and climatic variables. \u2018ns\u2019 no \nsignificant correlation; \u2018*\u2019 significant for p<0.05; \u2018**\u2019 highly significant for p<0.01. \n\n \n\nTable 3.8 - Spearman correlations between the set of wild rabbit variables and indicators of the abiotic factors such \n\nas soil, topography and climatic variables.  \n\n\u2018ns\u2019 no significant correlation; \u2018*\u2019 significant for p<0.05; \u2018**\u2019 highly significant for p<0.01. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nAnalyses of variance  \n\nWithin this section we present the main results of a One-way ANOVA analysis that were \n\nconducted to test the effects between different environmental parameters on the set of wild rabbit \n\nvariables that were studied. The effects of the following environmental parameters - reforestation \n\ndominant type (reforestations dominated by Quercus suber, Quercus ilex or Pinus pinea); Pinus \n\npresence (Pinus pinea presence or absence within sampling sites); shrubs\u2019 spatial distribution (shrubs\u2019 \n\nabsence; uniformly dispersed shrubs; shrubs distributed in patches; shrubs\u2019 continuous cloak); dominant \n\nsoil type (litossoil or luvissoil) - were tested for each wild rabbit variable (number of latrines; Kilometric \n\nAbundance Index; latrines\u2019 diameter; number of pellets; pellets\u2019 age). Figure 3.6 presents representative \n\nbox plots for the most significant results obtained.  \n\nWith respect to the reforestation dominant type (reforestations dominated by Quercus suber, \n\nQuercus ilex or by Pinus pinea), there were no significant differences in either of the rabbit variables \n\nstudied between reforestation types. The number of latrines, as well as the Kilometric Abundance Index, \n\nwere both not significantly different between reforestation dominant types (F2,20=1.434, p=0.262), \n\nalthough these were (slightly) variable between sites, especially among reforestations dominated by Q. \n\nsuber. Furthermore, latrines\u2019 average diameter was also not significantly different between reforestation \n\ntypes (F2,20=0.940, p=0.407), although they were more variable among Q. suber dominant reforestations. \n\nIn the same way, significant differences were not detected in pellets\u2019 average number (F2,20=0.400, \n\np=0.676), nor in pellets\u2019 estimated age (F2,20=1.080, p=0.359) between different reforestation types, \n\ndespite a tendency for a higher variability concerning pellets\u2019 average number among reforestations \n\ndominated by Q. suber, and similarly for pellets\u2019 estimated age\u2019s higher variability in P. pinea dominant \n\nreforestations.  \n\nRegarding Pinus presence (Pinus pinea presence or absence), there were also not detected any \n\nsignificant differences in either of the studied rabbit variables between Pinus presence or absence within \n\nsampling sites. As such, the number of latrines and Kilometric Abundance Index were not significantly \n\ndifferent between sites where Pinus was present and sites where it was not present (F1,21=0.054, \n\np=0.812), despite a higher variability in both number of latrines and KAI between sites, especially \n\namong sites where P. pinea was absent. Moreover, there were also no significant differences in latrines\u2019 \n\naverage diameter (F1,21=0.097, p=0.759) between sites with presence of Pinus and with no presence of \n\nPinus, although it was more variable between sites, particularly the ones where Pinus pinea was not \n\npresent. Following this tendency, pellets\u2019 average number also did not reveal any significant differences \n\nbetween sites where Pinus was present and where it was absent (F1,21=1.327e-05, p=0.997); however, it \n\nwas more variable between sites, especially within the ones where there are no Pinus. Similarly, there \n\nwere no significant differences in pellets\u2019 estimated age (F1,21=0.069, p=0.796) between Pinus presence \n\nor absence within sampling sites.    \n\nConcerning shrub\u2019s differential spatial distribution among sampling sites, no significant \n\ndifferences were detected for either of the considered wild rabbit variables between different shrub\u2019s \n\nspatial distribution within sampled sites. With that said, there were no significant differences in the \n\nnumber of latrines, nor in Kilometric Abundance Index (F3,19=1.393, p=0.276), between different \n\nshrubs\u2019 spatial distribution within sampling sites, despite a higher variability between sites, especially \n\namong the ones where shrubs were dominantly distributed within patches. As for latrines\u2019 average \n\ndiameter, it was not significantly different between sites with differences in shrubs\u2019 spatial distribution \n\n(F3,19=1.383, p=0.278), although diameters varied more especially between sites presenting shrubs \n\nmainly distributed within patches. In a similar way, pellets' average number was also not significantly \n\ndifferent between sites with shrubs' heterogeneous spatial distribution (F3,19=2.621, p= 0.081), even \n\nthough the number of pellets was more variable between sites in which shrubs were predominantly \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\ndistributed in patches. Finally, there were also no significant differences in pellets' estimated age \n\n(F3,19=0.252, p=0.859) between sampled sites exhibiting differential shrubs' spatial distribution.   \n\nIn terms of the dominant soil type (litossoil or luvissoil within sampled sites), there were no \n\nsignificant differences in either of the considered rabbit variables between different soil types within \n\nsampled sites. Therefore, no significant differences were found in the number of latrines, nor in \n\nKilometric Abundance Index (F1,21=0.402, p=0.533), between sites dominated by litossoil and \n\ndominated by luvissoil, although these were slightly more variable between sites that were dominated \n\nby litossoils. Similarly, there were no significant differences in latrines\u2019 average diameter (F1,21=0.381, \n\np=0.544) between litossoil dominant sites and luvissoil dominant sites, despite a higher variability in \n\ndiameters between sites dominated by litossoils. Pellets\u2019 average number was also not significantly \n\ndifferent between litossoil dominant sites and luvissoil dominant sites (F1,21=0.168, p=0.686), although \n\ntheir numbers were quite variable between sites dominated by litossoils. There were also no significant \n\ndifferences in pellets\u2019 estimated age (F1,21=0.357, p=0.557) between sites dominated by litossoils and \n\nsites dominated by luvissoils.  \n\nTaking into consideration the ANOVA results obtained and previously described, and since there \n\nwere no significant differences found among any of the tested groups (ANOVA associated p-values \n\nwere never below 0.05), Tukey post-hoc tests were not carried out.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDom_Ppinea Dom_Qilex Dom_Qsub\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n2\n\n0\n3\n\n0\n4\n\n0\n5\n\n0\n6\n\n0\n\nReforestation dominant species\n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr \n\no\nf l\n\na\ntr\n\nin\ne\n\ns\n\nAbsence Presence\n\n0\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n0\n\nPinus pinea presence\n\nL\na\n\ntr\nin\n\ne\ns\n' d\n\nia\nm\n\ne\nte\n\nr\n\nAbsence Continuous_cloak Patches Uniformly_dispersed\n\n0\n4\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nShrubs' spatial distribution\n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr \n\no\nf \np\n\ne\nll\ne\n\nts\n\nLitosoil Luvisoil\n\n0\n5\n\n0\n1\n\n5\n0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n\nType of soil\n\nK\nilo\n\nm\ne\n\ntr\nic\n\n A\nb\n\nu\nn\n\nd\na\n\nn\nce\n\n In\nd\n\ne\nx\n\nFigure 3.6 - Box plots between environmental parameters and rabbit variables. \n\n(top left) number of latrines among reforestation dominant types.

The same reasoning was used when considering Quercus and Pinus plantation \n\nland-use classes.  \n\nAs for the class \u201cwater masses\u201d, it includes lakes, lagoons, rivers, rivulets and respective riparian \n\ngalleries, dams, among any other water masses.  \n\nThe land-use class \u201chouses and orchards\u201d refers to any kind of house with associated orchards \n\nthat shows signs of human occupation and/or appropriation, whilst the class \u201cinfrastructures\u201d regards \n\nany other structure associated with human presence, but that are not permanently inhabited and/or used \n\n(in which there is a residual human presence and use that is not recurrent, but still not abandoned) and \n\nwithout any associated vegetation, such as storerooms and warehouses, depots, factories, sanctuaries, \n\nparking lots, and sheds, among others. Lastly, the class \u201cruins and abandoned wells\u201d refers to any \n\nstructure or building associated with human presence that is currently abandoned, including abandoned \n\norchards.

A general characterisation of the main land uses \n\nand occupation within the study area are presented in Table 3.9, whilst the total areas for the main land-\n\nuse classes created in the cartography for each sampling site can be found in Table 3.10. Figure 3.12 \n\nshows a representation of the general percentages of each land-use class for the global set of sampling \n\nsites in the study area.  \n\nAmong the set of land-use classes, it is possible to state that plantations (dominated by Quercus \n\nor Pinus) are the most representative class, as it had the highest area and relative percentage (almost \n\n50% of the total land occupation in the study area). Quercus plantations dominated by pastures seem to \n\nbe the dominant ones in the sampling sites (approximately 36% of total land use). Montados are the \n\nmost representative habitat right after Quercus plantations (present in a total of 33.81% of the study \n\narea), being montados dominated by pastures the ones with higher presence (24.35%). Pinus plantations \n\nare the dominant land-use after montados (occupying approximately 11% of the study area), being the \n\nones dominated by pastures the most represented ones (6.91%). Meadows and pastures are the dominant \n\nlandscape present in the study area following Pinus plantations (7.90% of the land use in the set of \n\nsampling sites). Brushwoods are only present in 3.18% of the sampling sites\u2019 area, whereas the land-use \n\nclasses associated with human presence and/or occupation (paved roads; houses and orchards; \n\ninfrastructures, and finally ruins and abandoned wells) only represent 3.09% of the land use of the study \n\narea, \u201chouses and orchards\u201d (1.75%) and \u201cpaved roads\u201d (1.12%) being the dominant ones. Water masses \n\nare the least represented habitat in the study area, as they are only present in 1% of the study area.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 - Examples of the land-use classes for human presence \n\nand/or occupation created in the cartography.

In the results presented afterwards, \u201cns\u201d stands for non-\n\nsignificant results, significant results are marked with \u201c*\u201d if the associated p-value was below 0.05, and \n\nwith \u201c**\u201d whenever the associated p-value was below 0.01.  \n\nRegarding the correlations obtained between rabbit variables and the total areas for each land-use \n\nclass (Table 3.11), results showed that there were significant correlations between all of the wild rabbit \n\nvariables (except for the variable \u201cpellets\u2019 estimated age\u201d, which did not correlate significantly with any \n\nof the studied habitat variables) with habitat variables related to vegetation cover (pastures and \n\nmontados), and to human\u2019s presence and/or occupation (infrastructures, houses and ruins). Rabbit \n\nvariables were significant and positively correlated to the land-use class \u201cmeadows and pastures\u201d, being \n\nlatrines\u2019 average diameter, the variable exhibiting the highest correlation (r=0.496, p=0.016), followed \n\nby pellets\u2019 average number (r=0.480, p=0.020), whilst Kilometric Abundance Index was the least \n\ncorrelated one (r=0.454, p=0.030). As for the land-use class \u201cmontados dominated by brushwoods\u201d, it \n\nwas highly and inversely correlated with latrines\u2019 average diameter (r=-0.541, p=0.008), then with \n\npellets\u2019 average number (r=-0.532, p=0.009), and finally with the Kilometric Abundance Index (r=-\n\n0.497, p=0.016). As for the variables concerning human presence and occupation, rabbit variables were \n\nparticularly correlated in a highly significant manner with the land-use class \u201cinfrastructures\u201d, pellets\u2019 \n\naverage number being the one with the most significant relation (r=0.652, p=0.001), followed by \n\nlatrines\u2019 average diameter (r=0.615, p=0.002), and finally by the Kilometric Abundance Index (r=0.568, \n\np=0.005). The land-use class \u201chouses and orchards\u201d was also significantly correlated to rabbit variables, \n\nonce again pellets\u2019 average number being the one with the most significant relation (r=0.614, p=0.002), \n\nthen latrines\u2019 average diameter (r=0.595, p=0.003), and finally the Kilometric Abundance Index with \n\nthe lowest correlation (r=0.470, p=0.024). Lastly, the land-use class \u201cruins and abandoned wells\u201d only \n\nshowed significant correlations with two rabbit variables: first with pellets\u2019 average number (r=0.442, \n\np=0.035), and then with latrines\u2019 average diameter (r=0.421, p=0.045).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n            \n\n    KAI NumPellets DiamLat PelletsAge \n\nPastures  meadows &amp; pastures .454* .480* .496* ns \n\nMontados dom. by brushwoods  -.497* -.532** -.541** ns \n\nHuman presence           \n\n&amp; occupation infrastructures .568** .652** .615** ns \n\n \nhouses &amp; orchards .470* .614** .595** ns \n\n  ruins &amp; abandoned wells ns .442* .421* ns \n\n      \n \n\nTable 3.11 - Spearman correlations between the set of wild rabbit variables and landscape variables (total areas \n\nof the land-use classes). \u2018ns\u2019 no significant correlation; \u2018*\u2019 significant for p<0.05; \u2018**\u2019 highly significant for p<0.01. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nThe correlation results between rabbit variables and the percentages of occupation of each land-\n\nuse class (Table 3.12) show us that all rabbit variables (except pellets\u2019 estimated age) were significantly \n\nrelated to habitat variables concerning vegetation cover and human presence and/or occupation, \n\nexhibiting significant and very significant correlations with the percentages of occupation of the land-\n\nuse classes \u201cmeadows and pastures\u201d, \u201cmontados dominated by brushwoods\u201d, \u201cinfrastructures\u201d, \u201chouses \n\nand orchards\u201d and \u201cruins and abandoned wells\u201d. However, in general the correlations were slightly lower \n\nthan the ones verified for the areas of each land-use class, except for the correlations between land-use \n\nclasses \u201cmeadows and pastures\u201d, in which all rabbit variables exhibited higher correlation coefficient \n\nvalues than the ones obtained for the areas of that class, particularly the variable latrines\u2019 average \n\ndiameter, which had a highly significant correlation with pastures that did not happen in the correlations \n\nbetween the total areas (for Kilometric Abundance Index: r=0.487, r=0.019; for pellets\u2019 average number: \n\nr=0.505, p=0.014; for latrines\u2019 average diameter: r=0.531, p=0.009). Moreover, the class \u201cmontados \n\ndominated by brushwoods\u201d also had very significant correlations with pellets\u2019 average number and \n\nlatrines\u2019 average diameter, although the one with pellets\u2019 average number was stronger (r=-0.539, \n\np=0.008) than the other correlations, which were lower when compared to the same correlations with \n\nthe total areas (for Kilometric Abundance Index: r=-0.489, p=0.018; for latrines\u2019 average diameter: r=-\n\n0.528, p=0.010). As for the variables related to human presence and occupation, in a general perspective \n\nthe correlation results are similar: all rabbit variables were highly related to the land-use class \n\n\u201cinfrastructures\u201d; however, the coefficient values are lower than the ones for the correlations between \n\nthe land-use classes\u2019 areas (for Kilometric Abundance Index: r=0.550, p=0.007; for pellets\u2019 average \n\nnumber: r=0.616, p=0.002; for latrines\u2019 average diameter: r=0.598, p=0.003). Similarly, the land-use \n\nclass \u201chouses and orchards\u201d also had a significant correlation with the Kilometric Abundance Index, \n\nalthough lower than the one verified for the area of that class (r=0.454, p=0.029), and very significant \n\ncorrelations with both pellets\u2019 average number (r=0.600, p=0.002) and latrines\u2019 average diameter \n\n(r=0.585, p=0.003), always lower than the correlation coefficient values obtained for that land-use class\u2019 \n\narea. As for the land-use class \u201cruins and abandoned wells\u201d, it was only significantly correlated with the \n\nvariable pellets\u2019 average number, although exhibiting a lower coefficient value compared to the one \n\nobtained for the land-use class\u2019 area (r=0.419, p=0.047). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n            \n\n    KAI NumPellets DiamLat PelletsAge \n\nPastures  meadows &amp; pastures .487* .505* .531** ns \n\nMontados dom. by brushwoods  -.489* -.539** -.528** ns \n\nHuman presence           \n\n&amp; occupation infrastructures .550** .616** .598** ns \n\n \nhouses &amp; orchards .454* .600** .585** ns \n\n  ruins &amp; abandoned wells ns .419* ns ns \n\n      \n \n\nTable 3.12 - Spearman correlations between the set of wild rabbit variables and landscape variables \n\n(percentages of the land-use classes\u2019 areas). \u2018ns\u2019 no significant correlation; \u2018*\u2019 significant for p<0.05; \u2018**\u2019 highly \n\nsignificant for p<0.01. \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n4. DISCUSSION \n\nIn this work, 23 sampling sites within cork-oak, holm-oak and stone-pine reforestations were \n\nstudied in a total of six municipalities of the Alentejo region in continental Portugal along an aridity \n\ngradient, in order to understand whether the European wild rabbit can be a good ecological indicator of \n\nthe success of reforestations.  \n\nFrom a general perspective, the set of sampling sites was quite heterogeneous, as most of the sites \n\nwere present within pure plantations primarily dominated by Quercus suber and in mixed plantations \n\nthat were mostly dominated by Pinus pinea, but with sampling sites located within reforestations with \n\ndifferent combinations of the target species. Moreover, plantations\u2019 total areas were quite variable, \n\nwhich influenced the number of linear transects that could be walked in each sampling site. Despite that, \n\nthe number of sampling sites in which respectively one and two linear transects were walked was the \n\nsame, which contributed to a more homogeneous and accurate sampling and data treatment.  \n\nA total of 36 linear foot-transects were walked to perform wild rabbit latrines and pellets\u2019 counts \n\nto obtain a Kilometric Abundance Index for the study area. For each sampling site, approximately 16 \n\nlatrines were detected on average, and a total of 372 latrines were detected within 20 sampling sites. In \n\nthe end, the results were quite successful given that, within the set of sampling sites, rabbit latrines were \n\nfound in a total of 32 transects (89% of transects with positive results), against only four transects where \n\nno latrines were found (11% of transects with negative results). When considering the number of latrines \n\nfound along dirt tracks or along plantation lines/interlines, we can say that the results were quite variable \n\nand surprising, given that the highest number of latrines were not found along dirt tracks alone, but \n\ninstead along plantations\u2019 lines/inter-lines within sampling sites. This could be since a large number of \n\ntransects were walked along plantation lines/interlines, to the fact that the nature of this terrain resembles \n\nthat of the dirt track terrain (being favourable locations to deposit latrines), and to the favourable soil \n\nsubstrates of lines for the construction of burrows. Also, the highest number of latrines detected was \n\nwithin reforestations dominated by Pinus pinea and Quercus suber respectively, while reforestations \n\ndominated by Quercus ilex were the ones where smaller numbers of latrines were found. This could be \n\nrelated to the fact that a considerable proportion of sampling sites were located within Quercus suber \n\nand Pinus pinea plantations and fewer in those of Quercus ilex, or possibly to the observers\u2019 different \n\ndetectability levels of rabbit latrines and pellets within different reforestation types.  \n\nAs for the correlations between the set of wild rabbit variables (number of latrines; Kilometric \n\nAbundance Index; latrines\u2019 average diameter; pellets\u2019 average number, and finally pellets\u2019 estimated \n\nage), the results obtained revealed, as highly expected, that they are all strongly correlated with each \n\nother. These results are both statistically and empirically plausible, given that all correlations between \n\neach wild rabbit variable were statistically significant, all the variables obtained refer to rabbit latrines \n\nand pellets\u2019 features, and are in accordance with the observations and the data obtained during rabbit \n\nfield sampling. The perfect correlation between the number of latrines and the Kilometric Abundance \n\nIndex is because KAI is an abundance index that was directly calculated using the number of latrines. \n\nThe highly significant positive correlation between the number of latrines and the Kilometric Abundance \n\nIndex with latrines\u2019 average diameter (r=0.972; p<0.01) can be explained by rabbits\u2019 social preference \n\nand tendency for certain areas to deposit their pellets. Since pellets\u2019 accumulation within latrines is a \n\nvital socialization event among rabbit groups, to which they dedicate a significant amount of their time \n\n(G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Virg\u00f3s et al. 2003), it is only right that there is a greater number of latrines in such \n\nfavourable areas, which occupy higher spaces in the soil, and that will naturally be reflected in higher \n\nlatrine diameters. Moreover, a higher number of pellets present in the soil over time illustrate wild \n\nrabbits\u2019 suitability for these areas, so if the same areas remain suitable for them, rabbits will recurrently \n\ndeposit their droppings and tend to choose the same specific locations for their latrines (Fernandez-de-\n\nSimon et al. 2011; Sneddon 1991). Therefore, it is expected to see an increase in the number of pellets \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nwith a natural equal increase in the number of latrines, which occurs in rabbits\u2019 preferential faecal \n\naccumulation sites, which explains the significant correlation between the KAI and pellets\u2019 average \n\nnumber (r=0.938; p<0.01). Similarly, there was a significant relation between the number of latrines and \n\nthe Kilometric Abundance Index with pellets\u2019 estimated age (r=0.592; p=0.003). If older pellets have \n\nbeen deposited in the soil for longer periods of time than other more recent ones, such pellet deposition \n\nis more likely to continue happening over time within more favourable areas for rabbits where it \n\nhappened in the past, which can explain the increase in the number of latrines found in such regions \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves 2015; Morgado 2008). Moreover, the average number of pellets was highly correlated with \n\nlatrines\u2019 average diameter (r=0.962; p<0.01). Considering that, as previously pointed out, rabbits tend \n\nto deposit their pellets within certain suitable areas in a social context (Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez et al. 2008; \n\nSneddon 1991), it is alleged that more deposited pellets over time will occupy larger areas in the soil, \n\nwhich potentially explains the expected increase in latrines\u2019 diameters.  \n\nFurthermore, pellets\u2019 average number and pellets\u2019 estimated age were also significantly correlated \n\nwith each other (r=0.627; p=0.001), which could also be explained by a significant preference of rabbits \n\nfor certain regions in the soil, in which they would frequently deposit their pellets, thus establishing their \n\nlatrines, in the past. In this way, the more advanced age of pellets, associated with higher pellet numbers \n\npresent in the soil, potentially illustrate wild rabbits\u2019 preference in the past for such areas. In the same \n\nway, clearly there is a highly significant positive correlation between latrines\u2019 average diameter and \n\npellets\u2019 estimated age (r=0.611; p=0.002). Higher latrine diameters are generally associated with a larger \n\nnumber of pellets present in the soil, which will be increasingly older according to rabbits\u2019 faecal \n\ndeposition during past periods.  \n\nRegarding the correlations between rabbit variables and environmental parameters that stand for \n\nboth habitat structure and complexity and climate factors of the reforestations studied, results show that \n\nrabbit variables were significantly related to a total of 11 environmental variables. From these, only one \n\nparameter concerning the tree layer (standard deviation of tree height) was significantly correlated to \n\nwild rabbit variables. Two environmental parameters dealt with under canopy conditions, one of which \n\nwas related to shrub communities (shrub species richness and shrub species richness including Quercus \n\nspp. seedlings), while the other was related to herbaceous plants (herbaceous and moss cover). \n\nFurthermore, there was only one parameter concerning soil features (soil organic matter content) that \n\nwas correlated with the wild rabbit, solely one parameter about topography (altitude), and finally five \n\nclimatic parameters (aridity index; annual mean temperature; temperature seasonality; annual mean \n\nprecipitation; precipitation of the wettest month). \n\nIt is possible to say that, from the set of obtained correlations between reforestation\u2019s \n\nenvironmental parameters and wild rabbit variables, only some of them can be considered plausible \n\nfrom both a statistical and empirical perspective. Having said this, only the parameters that concern the \n\ntree layer (standard deviation of tree height), topography (altitude), and climatic ones (aridity index; \n\nannual mean temperature; temperature seasonality; annual mean precipitation; precipitation of the \n\nwettest month) actually make sense and can be considered as plausible from a statistical and empirical \n\npoint of view, as they are in accordance with the expected results concerning the wild rabbit\u2019s behavior \n\nand distribution in relation to such environmental parameters (Ferreira 2003; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; \n\nGon\u00e7alves 2015; LPN 2014). Tree height\u2019s standard deviation seems to have a negative influence on \n\nthe wild rabbit, since they were inversely related to each other. This relation denotes tree height \n\nheterogeneity\u2019s negative effect on wild rabbits\u2019 presence (number of latrines) and abundance \n\n(Kilometric Abundance Index). This is a plausible result, as it is known that rabbits\u2019 most suitable areas \n\ngenerally include a homogeneous tree substrate which can give higher shading and protection against \n\npredators. Rather than heterogeneity within tree heights and forestry structure (which may not guarantee \n\nshading and protection against predators in such an efficient way), rabbits do indeed prefer heterogeneity \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nwithin shrubby and herbaceous communities\u2019 structure, allowing for rabbits\u2019 easier shifts between \n\nfeeding and protection areas (Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves 2015). It also seems that rabbit\u2019s presence and \n\nabundance decreases as plantations grow older in successional terms. This could be explained by the \n\nfact that older plantations may have a more homogeneous spatial structure because of brushwoods\u2019 \n\nclearance operations, as part of maintenance and management practices in the plantations over the years. \n\nShrubs\u2019 clearance reduces the spatial heterogeneity of the plantations, especially concerning shrub and \n\nherbaceous patches, which makes them less suitable habitats for rabbits.  \n\nAmong topography parameters, altitude was the only one significantly related to the wild rabbit, \n\nalthough it was only inversely related to latrines\u2019 average diameter. This inverse relation between \n\naltitude and the wild rabbit is once again plausible either in statistical and empirical perspectives, as it \n\nis consistent with the wild rabbit\u2019s habitat suitability requirements, being known that rabbits tend not to \n\nbe present in regions above 1500 m (Smith &amp; Boyer 2008). Regarding climatic parameters, the aridity \n\nindex was inversely related to some wild rabbit variables. This inverse relation is also plausible in this \n\nwork, as it is known, and has been proven within the context of the AdaptforChange Project, that aridity \n\n(along with precipitation) is indeed one of the most limiting ecological factors for vegetation growth \n\nwithin Mediterranean regions (Pr\u00edncipe et al. 2014). This is particularly noticeable within dryland \n\nforests, as increasing aridity affects quite negatively trees\u2019 growth, trees, shrubs and herbaceous \n\nproductivity, besides interfering in soil quality. Given the vital importance of habitat and landscape \n\nstructure and the complexity parameters of the wild rabbit\u2019s distribution and abundance, it makes perfect \n\nsense that rabbits tend not to be so abundant within areas characterized by impoverished tree, shrubs \n\nand herbaceous layers and weak soils. Independently of this inverse relation, according to these results \n\nrabbits seem to prefer regions that are more arid and dry, even though these regions are usually \n\nassociated with a lower biomass of herbaceous species (herbaceous plants being the vital food source \n\nfor rabbits, this was an unexpected result). The fact that rabbits are not so present in regions with higher \n\nherbaceous biomass and higher precipitation rates may be explained by the possible negative influence \n\nof precipitation (inundation) on the integrity of burrows where rabbit cubs and juveniles are safe, directly \n\ninterfering in their reproduction and in cubs and juveniles\u2019 survival. In those regions, the limiting effect \n\nof precipitation plays a more dominant role in determining habitat\u2019s suitability rather than the abundant \n\npresence of herbaceous plants. Furthermore, annual mean temperature, as well as temperature \n\nseasonality, were both positively related to wild rabbits\u2019 variables, which were also expected, as it \n\nsuggests and reinforces temperature\u2019s vital positive roles in the wild rabbit\u2019s presence and abundance in \n\nthe study area through the promotion of food availability and rabbit reproduction (Fern\u00e1ndez 2005; \n\nG\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; LPN 2014; Martins et al. 2003). On the other hand, both annual mean precipitation \n\nand precipitation of the wettest month were inversely related to some wild rabbit variables. This is quite \n\na plausible result that is not surprising at all, since rabbits do indeed usually avoid areas with high \n\nprecipitation rates due to precipitation\u2019s negative influence and effects on wild rabbit\u2019s food supplies \n\nand reproductive rates, thus directly interfering in their presence and abundance (Fern\u00e1ndez 2005; \n\nG\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; Gon\u00e7alves 2015; LPN 2014; Martins et al. 2003).  \n\nOn the other hand, the parameters related to under canopy conditions (shrubs and herbaceous \n\ncommunities), and to soil features (organic matter content), which were expected to be the most \n\nrelevantly related to the wild rabbit (given the strict relation between habitat favorability and the wild \n\nrabbit\u2019s presence and abundance), were precisely the ones that showed inverse relations that are not \n\ncoherent, either statistically nor empirically speaking. The inverse relations found between shrub species \n\nrichness (number of shrub species), either including or not including Quercus spp. seedlings, herbaceous \n\nand moss cover, and finally soil organic matter content, with wild rabbit variables do not make sense \n\neither in statistical terms, or in empirical ones, as they are not in accordance with wild rabbits\u2019 known \n\nand expected habitat requisites and behaviour. This result does not necessarily mean that the number of \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nshrub species, whether oak seedlings are included or not, as well as herbaceous and moss cover and soil \n\norganic matter content, have a negative influence upon wild rabbits\u2019 behavior, presence and abundance, \n\nespecially with regard to latrines and pellets\u2019 deposition, as can be assumed by their statistical relation \n\nand significance. Alternatively, these results are most likely explained by the fact that a higher number \n\nof shrub species, especially when the number of oak seedlings is included, a higher herbaceous and moss \n\ncover, and higher soil organic matter content, directly interfere in latrines and pellets\u2019 detectability level \n\nby the observer at the time of sampling, having a significant impact on the efficiency of latrines and \n\npellets\u2019 detection. This is unfortunately a technical limitation related to the method applied within this \n\nwork, as it solely involved wild rabbit traces\u2019 prospections, which are highly dependent on the subjective \n\ndetectability levels of the observer to visually detect presence traces. Although there was no correlation \n\nfound between any of the wild rabbit variables studied with shrub cover, we should highlight in this \n\npoint that, within the three sampling sites where no latrines were found, two of them were precisely the \n\nones that had the highest values of shrub cover. The absence of latrines in those sites may be explained \n\nprecisely by the significant shrub presence and consequent lack of transitional opened areas, which are \n\nunsuitable areas for rabbits. On the other hand, dense vegetation cover has a relevant direct interference \n\nupon the detectability levels of pellets and other presence signs by the observer at the time of sampling, \n\nwhich was most likely what occurred in the perspective of the present work.  \n\nAs for the results concerning ANOVA analysis performed to test the effects between \n\nenvironmental parameters on the set of wild rabbit variables studied, they did not show any significant \n\ndifferences in either of the rabbit variables studied. No significant differences were detected between: \n\nreforestation dominant type (reforestations dominated by Quercus suber, Quercus ilex or Pinus pinea); \n\nPinus presence (Pinus pinea presence or absence within sampling sites); shrubs\u2019 spatial distribution \n\n(shrubs\u2019 absence; uniformly dispersed shrubs; shrubs distributed in patches; shrubs\u2019 continuous cloak); \n\ndominant soil type (litossoil or luvissoil) with the set of wild rabbit variables considered (number of  \n\nlatrines; Kilometric Abundance Index; latrines\u2019 diameter; number of pellets; pellets\u2019 age). \n\nThe correlations obtained between the set of rabbit variables and environmental variables \n\nassociated with the studied reforestations suggest a lack of association between wild rabbits\u2019 abundance \n\nand environmental parameters that are representative of habitat\u2019s structure and complexity within \n\nreforestations that aid in evaluating their success.  \n\nWith that said, it was decided to perform a spatial analysis of the diversity of land uses and \n\noccupation around the set of sampling sites through the design of buffers within a range of 250 meters \n\naround both the linear transects and the plantations\u2019 polygons and land-use cartography within such \n\nbuffers that was mainly focused on the types of vegetation cover, the presence of water, and finally \n\ninfrastructures and buildings associated with human presence and occupation, as these are \n\nenvironmental and landscape parameters that are specially relevant for the wild rabbit\u2019s presence and \n\nabundance in a certain region. As previously mentioned, the decision to create buffers within a range of \n\n250 meters around both the linear transects and around the plantations' polygons and obtaining a final \n\n\"merged\" buffer that included transects' buffer and plantations' buffer was due to the fact that, in some \n\nsampling sites, transects were carried out either partially or completely outside the limits of the studied \n\nplantations. Creating a so called \"final\" buffer seemed to be the most plausible course of action to \n\novercome that spatial heterogeneity of transects' location within sampling sites and to perform a more \n\nhomogeneous cartography around sampling sites.  \n\nThe cartography of the main land uses and occupation carried out showed that the set of sampling \n\nsites are characterized by a heterogeneous landscape with mosaics of differential landscapes and habitats \n\nthat include vegetation-related habitats (Quercus suber, Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea pure or mixed \n\nplantations, either dominated by pastures or by brushwoods; montados, either dominated by pastures or \n\nby brushwoods; meadows and pastures, and brushwoods); habitats related to the presence of water \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n(water masses), as well as habitats associated with human presence and/or occupation (houses and \n\norchards; infrastructures; ruins and abandoned wells, and paved roads). In a general overview, \n\nplantations are the dominant land-use class occupying almost 50% of the total land occupation in the \n\nstudy area, Quercus plantations dominated by pastures being the dominant ones. Montados are the most \n\nrepresentative habitat right after Quercus plantations, once again the ones dominated by pastures \n\nrepresenting the most frequent ones, then Pinus plantations (dominated by pastures), followed by \n\nmeadows and pastures, brushwoods, then the land-use classes associated with human presence and/or \n\noccupation, the dominant ones being the classes \u201chouses and orchards\u201d and \u201cpaved roads\u201d , and finally \n\nthe least represented habitat are water masses, only present in 1% of the study area. \n\nSpearman correlations were carried out between the set of wild rabbit variables and the calculated \n\nareas and respective percentages of occupation of each land-use class created in the cartography, which \n\nstand for habitat/landscape variables. The results revealed that there were significant correlations \n\nbetween all the wild rabbit variables (except pellets\u2019 estimated age) with habitat variables concerning \n\nvegetation cover: meadows &amp; pastures and montados dominated by brushwoods, and concerning \n\nhuman\u2019s presence and/or occupation: infrastructures, houses &amp; orchards and ruins &amp; abandoned wells. \n\nThis was valid for both correlations done between each land-use classes\u2019 areas and for the percentages \n\nof occupation of each land-use class within the set of sampling sites.  \n\nRabbit variables were significantly and positively correlated with the land-use class \u201cmeadows \n\nand pastures\u201d, especially latrines\u2019 average diameter, which had the most significant correlation (for the \n\nareas: r=0.496, p=0.016; for the percentages: r=0.531, p=0.009). This strict relation between rabbit \n\nvariables with meadows and pastures was more than expected, given that these are preferential feeding \n\nhabitats for rabbits that support their herbaceous diet, composed mainly of grasses and leguminous \n\nplants, as well as cereal species. Those species present in meadows and pasturelands have the highest \n\nnutritive value, protein levels and reduced fibre content, being vital for triggering rabbits' reproduction \n\nand for juveniles' optimal growth (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves 2015).  \n\nOn the other hand, the land-use class \u201cmontados dominated by brushwoods\u201d was particularly \n\ncorrelated in a negative way with latrines\u2019 average diameter (for the areas: r=-0.541, p=0.008) and \n\npellets\u2019 average number (for the percentages: r=-0.539, p=0.008). Although montados could be \n\ngenerally considered as suitable habitats for rabbits due to their interspersed mosaics of holm and cork \n\noak woodlands mingled with pastures, forested areas, Mediterranean shrub and scrublands, and \n\nagricultural areas associated with low human presence and disturbance (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; \n\nLPN 2014; Pinto-Correia et al. 2011), the truth is that in this work they did not correlate in a positive \n\nway. This could be due to the fact that the landscape may still be relatively homogeneous due to a \n\nreduced presence of shrubs and herbaceous species (Mira et al. 2007), or perhaps because shrubs' cover \n\nwithin those montados may not be in the ideal growth state in which they can provide shelter for rabbits, \n\ntherefore not being very suitable for them.  \n\nAs for the variables concerning human presence and occupation, rabbit variables were particularly \n\ncorrelated in a highly significant manner with the land-use class \u201cinfrastructures\u201d, pellets\u2019 average \n\nnumber being the one with the most significant relation (for the areas: r=0.652, p=0.001; for the \n\npercentages: r=0.616, p=0.002). This was quite an unexpected result, especially taking into account the \n\ngeneral dimension of the designed buffers. Nevertheless, this result could be explained by the fact that \n\ninfrastructures refer to structures and buildings associated with human presence, but that are not \n\npermanently inhabited and/or used, and in which there is most likely a residual human presence and \n\ndisturbance; therefore, they may be used if needed as shelter and refugee spots by rabbits (Fernandez-\n\nde-Simon et al. 2011; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; LPN 2014; Zim &amp; Hoffmeister 1955). Similarly, the land-\n\nuse class \u201chouses and orchards\u201d was also significantly correlated with rabbit variables, pellets\u2019 average \n\nnumber (for the areas: r=0.614, p=0.002; for the percentages: r=0.600, p=0.002) being once again the \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\none with the most significant relation. This could be because this land-use class generally refers to small \n\nrural houses possibly owned by farmers and/or landowners and usually located in the proximity of \n\npasturelands, agricultural and horticultural lands and other opened regions, therefore being distant from \n\nlarge urban areas and probably associated with low human presence and disturbance (LPN 2014; Pinto-\n\nCorreia et al. 2011). Those factors associated to the presence of orchards, which could provide additional \n\nfood resources to the rabbit, can explain this habitat' suitability for rabbits. Finally, the land-use class \n\n\u201cruins and abandoned wells\u201d was significantly related to pellets\u2019 average number (for the areas: r=0.442, \n\np=0.035; for the percentages: r=0.419, p=0.047). This correlation is possibly due to the fact that this \n\nclass regards human-related structures and buildings that are currently abandoned, thus not being \n\naffected by human presence or intervention. Moreover, such abandoned structures can be used as refugee \n\nor protection sites for the rabbit, not to mention that these abandoned buildings are usually associated \n\nwith the presence of spontaneous vegetation, mainly herbaceous species that could complement the \n\nrabbit's diet. We should also highlight that abandoned wells are a very relevant sign of past agricultural \n\nareas, which provide a wide set of feeding resources for the rabbit (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira \n\n2003).  \n\nThe most surprising result was that there were indeed no significant correlations at all between \n\nany of the plantations' land-use classes (Quercus and Pinus plantations dominated by pastures and \n\ndominated by brushwoods) with any of the wild rabbit variables. Although not statistically significant, \n\nthere were positive correlations between plantations and the rabbit, which were higher regarding first of \n\nall Pinus plantations dominated by brushwoods, followed by Quercus plantations dominated by \n\nbrushwoods and finally Pinus plantations dominated by pastures. Surprisingly, Quercus plantations \n\ndominated by pastures were inversely correlated to rabbit variables; however, correlations were not \n\nsignificant, therefore those results are not presented in this work. Although these correlations are not \n\nsignificant, we could still highlight the fact that Pinus pinea seems to have a more positive effect upon \n\nthe rabbit's presence and abundance in the study area than Quercus ilex or Quercus suber, and that \n\nrabbits seem to have a greater preference for plantations that are dominated by brushwoods, which could \n\nindicate rabbit's preference in the first place for more suitable habitats in terms of shelter requisites \n\n(brushwoods with shrub cover) rather than more suitable habitats in terms of feeding requirements \n\n(pastures). Nevertheless, the fact that there were no significant correlations between plantations and \n\nrabbit variables indicates that, from a general overview, plantations seem to be indifferent to rabbits in \n\nterms of suitable habitats, or that, although plantations are actually the dominant land-use class within \n\nthe set of sampling sites, they are perhaps still not extensive enough to interfere in the remaining \n\nlandscape mosaic heterogeneity that is suitable enough for the rabbit's presence and abundance in the \n\nstudy area.  \n\nTo summarize, although the land-use cartography showed that there were some interesting \n\nsignificant correlations between wild rabbit variables and relevant habitat ones, such as meadows and \n\npastures, montados dominated by brushwoods, houses and orchards, and finally ruins and abandoned \n\nwells that were in general expected and plausible, in the end the truth is that none of the wild rabbit \n\nvariables exhibited a significant correlation with the plantations. With that said, certain data limitations \n\nassociated with the results obtained in this work (no significant relations between rabbits\u2019 abundance, \n\nreforestation, climate variables and the plantations) do indeed not allow us to demonstrate that the rabbit \n\nplays a key role as an indicator of the success of reforestations in southern Portuguese drylands.  \n\nAs for the main limitations related to this work, we should essentially highlight the heterogeneous \n\ndetectability levels for rabbit latrines and pellets according to differential substrates (dirt tracks; \n\nplantation lines/interlines; pastures) in which rabbit latrines\u2019 counts were carried out, associated with \n\nthe observer\u2019s minimal experience concerning wild rabbit latrines and pellets\u2019 detection and concerning \n\ndata treatment and analysis. Moreover, the reduced number of plantations that were sampled (related to \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\ncertain technical limitations and delays regarding the selection of the plantations, and to personal and \n\nhealth issues), coupled with the fact that the plantations\u2019 ages are very homogeneous, and thus very \n\nrecent (poorly developed shrubby substrate, which could explain a lower suitability for rabbits), as well \n\nas rabbit\u2019s low densities in the Portuguese territory, possibly related to the known incidence of viral \n\ndiseases in the Iberian Peninsula (though it was not possible to obtain data regarding rabbit diseases in \n\nthis work), constitute relevant limitations within the context of the present work that influenced the \n\nresults obtained. Further, the way in which the average number of droppings was calculated may have \n\nled to an overestimate of the results obtained.   \n\nAlthough rabbits exhibit several conditions for constituting a good ecological indicator, given its \n\nvital role as a multifunctional keystone species within Mediterranean ecosystems (Delibes-Mateos et al. \n\n2010; Ferreira 2003; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2012; LPN 2014), associated with their ecological plasticity and \n\nexceptional adaptation capacities as a result of a complex social structure, crepuscular habits, elevated \n\nfecundity, growth rates, early maturity and exquisite ability to escape (Ferreira 2003), the truth is that, \n\nin the Iberian Peninsula, they end up not being good indicators of the success of reforestations, given \n\ntheir current distribution and density situation in this region (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Fernandez-de-\n\nSimon et al. 2011; G\u00e1lvez-Bravo 2011; LPN 2014; Ward 2005). Wild rabbit populations have been \n\nsuffering a massive decline over past decades mainly due to habitat loss and fragmentation, viral diseases \n\nwith devastating effects among rabbit effectives, and human-induced mortality especially through \n\nhunting (Cabezas-D\u00edaz et al. 2009; Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2014; ICNF 2005; \n\nWard 2005). These factors are responsible for the wild rabbit\u2019s current uneven distribution and \n\nextremely low and highly fragmented densities across Portugal and Spain (Cabezas-D\u00edaz et al. 2009; \n\nDelibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Santos-Reis 2014; ICNF 2005). Given the unstable and highly \n\nfragmented distribution and density of the wild rabbit within the Iberian Peninsula, the number of \n\neffectives in the population is so extremely low that they end up preventing the wild rabbit from being \n\na good ecological indicator. Therefore, their fragile situation in the Portuguese territory determines that \n\nthey are indeed not a good ecological indicator.  \n\nAs for future work perspectives, it is suggested that a wider number of reforestation sites should \n\nbe sampled, to complement and reinforce wild rabbit presence signs\u2019 data, and to strengthen the \n\nstatistical viability of the results that were obtained. Also, to be taken into consideration and studied, we \n\nshould point to potential signs of other animals present in the same regions as the wild rabbit (such as \n\npredators, or the wild boar), given that these may interfere in wild rabbits\u2019 presence and abundance in \n\nsuch regions, or even contribute to explaining rabbits\u2019 absence.  \n\nTo summarize, given the vital importance of rabbits as a keystone species in Mediterranean \n\necosystems and their potential as an ecological indicator, it is fundamental to adopt management tools \n\nand measures to ensure the recuperation of their populations, so that their fragile distribution and density \n\nsituation can be reverted, allowing them to reacquire their potential as good ecological indicators in \n\nPortugal, as well as in the rest of their distribution range.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n5. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n\nIn this work, the wild rabbit\u2019s relative abundance was estimated within holm-oak, cork-oak and \n\nstone-pine plantations along an aridity gradient in the southern region of continental Portugal. The goal \n\nwas to understand whether the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus - Linnaeus, 1758) is a good indicator \n\nof the success of historical reforestations in southern Portuguese drylands.  \n\nThe wild rabbit exhibits several favourable conditions for being a good ecological indicator, given \n\nits vital role as a multifunctional keystone species within Mediterranean ecosystems, especially in the \n\nIberian Peninsula. They have a multiplicity of relevant roles and impacts in the structure, quality and \n\ncomplexity of these Mediterranean habitats, as ecosystem engineers and landscape shapers, and are the \n\nmain prey for a wide series of major Mediterranean predators.  \n\nThe wild rabbit\u2019s relative abundance was estimated through latrine counts along foot-transects, \n\nusing the total number of latrines to calculate the Kilometric Abundance Index (KAI) for each sampling \n\nsite. The relation between rabbits\u2019 relative abundance and environmental variables associated with the \n\nstructure and complexity of reforestations was evaluated, to determine whether the wild rabbit performs \n\nrelevant roles in reforestations\u2019 ecosystems, thus having the potential to be a good indicator of the suc-\n\ncess of Portuguese dryland reforestations. Furthermore, a spatial analysis of the diversity of land use \n\nand occupation around the set of sampling sites - through the design of buffers and land-use cartography \n\n- was carried out in order to determine how the composition and structure of the landscape influence the \n\npresence and abundance of the wild rabbit in the study area. The relation between the rabbit's relative \n\nabundance and habitat variables (areas and percentages of occupation of each land-use class) was also \n\nevaluated.  \n\nThe results obtained in this work suggest a lack of significant association between the wild rabbit's \n\nabundance, environmental variables associated with reforestations, and plantation areas. This being so, \n\nwe can conclude that the wild rabbit is indeed not a good indicator of the success of reforestations in \n\nsouthern Portuguese drylands.  \n\nThe wild rabbit ends up not being a clear ecological indicator in the Iberian Peninsula, given its \n\ncurrent uneven distribution and extremely low and highly fragmented densities across the Portuguese \n\nand Spanish territories. Rabbits\u2019 current distribution and density in this region is the unfortunate result \n\nof a massive decline in rabbit populations over past decades mainly due to habitat loss and fragmenta-\n\ntion, the emergence of viral diseases, and excessive pressure from hunting. In this fashion, the extremely \n\nlow number of effectives in the population prevents rabbits from being good ecological indicators. \n\nTherefore, the wild rabbit\u2019s fragile situation in continental Portugal determines that it is indeed not a \n\ngood ecological indicator, which is unfortunately reinforced by the results obtained in this dissertation.   \n\nGiven the wild rabbit\u2019s current fragile situation in the Iberian Peninsula and its status as a multi-\n\nfunctional keystone species in Mediterranean ecosystems, measures for the management and recovery \n\nof rabbit populations should be taken, so that the species can regain a fundamental role as an ecological \n\nindicator in this zone and, hopefully, in other countries as well. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES \n\nADAPTFORCHANGE.
