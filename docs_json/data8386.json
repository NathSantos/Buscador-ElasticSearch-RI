It was preceded by a tholeiitic cycle in the Early Jurassic (200-198 Ma) \n\nand by a transitional episode during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous transition (147-\n\n142 Ma). \n\nThe alkaline cycle took place in a post-rift setting, after oceanic break-up, and is \n\ncontemporaneous of the opening of the Bay of Biscay and consequential 35\u00ba \n\ncounterclockwise rotation of Iberia, as well as with the first phases of tectonic inversion \n\nin the Mesozoic Lusitanian and Algarve Basins, as a result of the onset of the \n\nconvergence and collision between the Iberian, European and African plates. \n\nOnshore, this cycle includes the intrusive Sintra, Sines and Monchique igneous \n\ncomplexes, the extrusive Lisbon Volcanic Complex as well as several other minor \n\nintrusions scattered in the Lusitanian and Algarve basins, such as the Foz da Fonte  sill, \n\nthe Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill, the Mafra Radial dyke complex, the Oeiras Cascais dykes and the \n\nlamprophyre-basanite suite of the littoral Algarve. It extends offshore where it is \n\nrepresented by the Madeira-Tore Rise and the Ormonde peak in the Gorringe Bank. \n\nIn this study, the geochronology of the Late Cretaceous onshore occurrences was \n\nupdated through the acquisition of new U-Pb, 40Ar/39Ar, K-Ar and Rb-Sr. The \n\ncombination of these data with previously published ages allowed to better constrain the \n\nduration of this cycle (94-72 Ma), as well as for the identification of two separate \n\nmagmatic pulses.  \n\nThe first pulse took place between 94 and 88 Ma and is restricted to the Foz da \n\nFonte and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sills, both of which occur in the Lusitanian basin, between N39\u00ba \n\nand N38\u00ba20'. This pulse is contemporaneous with the opening of the Bay of Biscay and \n\nconsequent rotation of Iberia (118-80 Ma). \n\nThe second pulse has a younger age (75-72 Ma,) wider geographical \n\ndistribution, between the Lisbon region (? 39\u00baN) and the Algarve (? 37\u00baN), and \n\noccurred simultaneously with the initial stages of the Alpine orogeny in the WIM, \n\nwhich culminated in the formation of the Betics and Pyrenees as well as to the inversion \n\nof the Mesozoic basins.  \n\nThe age obtained for the Sintra granite (79.2 Ma \u00b1 0.8), is equivalent within \n\nerror to the oldest age obtained for the syenite (78.3 \u00b1 1.9 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987) \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nbut older than the other K-Ar ages obtained for these rocks (76.4 \u00b1 1.4 and 76.1 \u00b1 1.1 \n\nMa, Storetvedt et al., 1987) and for the gabbros (74.9 \u00b1 1 Ma Storetvedt et al., 1987). \n\nThe combination of the geochronological data with the observed field cross-cutting \n\nrelations and geophysical data (gravimetry and AMS), appears to indicate that the Sintra \n\ngranite corresponds to an older phase that was intruded by a more recent gabbro to \n\nsyenite suite. \n\nGeochemical analysis of samples from both pulses revealed that these rocks \n\nderive from small degrees (1-6%) of partial melting of trace element enriched garnet \n\nperidotite sources, with fairly homogenous isotopic compositions reflecting low time-\n\nintegrated Rb/Sr and high Sm/Nd and U/Pb ratios, which are compatible with a sub-\n\nlithospheric origin. However, there are clear differences in the trace element abundance \n\npatterns in rocks from the first and second pulses. Samples from the second pulse show \n\nnegative K, Zr, Hf and sometimes even Ti anomalies, which are absent in the first pulse \n\nand that are probably related to a metasomatic event. The metasomatic agent is likely to \n\ncorrespond to a melt of carbonatitic to siliceous volatile (CO2+H2O) rich nature that \n\npromoted, for example the stability of a hydrated K rich phase such as amphibole. \n\nAmphibole is unstable at the temperatures that characterize the asthenosphere or mantle \n\nplumes and therefore the negative K anomalies should indicate interaction of the \n\nascending sub-lithospheric magmas the metasomatized lithospheric mantle or melting of \n\nthe latter. This metasomatic signature is more noticeable in the rocks which derived \n\nfrom smaller fractions of melting, becoming progressively diluted as melting degree \n\nincreases. \n\nIn terms of isotopic composition, no major differences are observed between the \n\nrocks of the second pulse, which show a clear metasomatic contribution, and the rocks \n\nof the first pulse which do not show such a signature. This indicates that the \n\nmetasomatic agent probably originated from the same sublithospheric source which had \n\nearlier produced the magmas of the first pulse.  \n\nThe differences in trace element signatures between the two pulses created by \n\nthis metasomatic episode can be related to their contemporaneous geodynamic context. \n\nDuring the first pulse, the rotation of Iberia created a stress regime favorable to quick \n\nmagma ascent while from 80 Ma onwards, the onset of continental collision restricted \n\nthe opening of fractures and magma ascent, favouring the interaction of the ascending \n\nmagmas with the lithosphere, probably resulting in the metasomatism of the lithospheric \n\nmantle and the formation of amphibole during or previous to the second pulse. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nUncontaminated samples show isotopic signatures (87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; \n\n?Ndi 5.7\u20133.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-\n39.00) that are distinct from the previous tholeiitic and transitional cycles and point \n\ntowards a sublithospheric source, unlike the previous cycles, which show an important \n\nlithospheric contribution. These signatures are also very similar to the ones observed in \n\nthe rocks derived from the melting of the Canaries mantle plume, which was located \n\nnear the WIM during the Late Cretaceous, according to paleogeographic reconstitutions \n\nand paleomagnetic data, and is therefore considered the most likely source for the melts \n\nand metasomatic agents that were identified in this study. \n\nThe large volume of magmatism that took place in the onshore and offshore \n\nWIM during the Late Cretaceous is also compatible with an origin from a deep seated \n\nhot mantle anomaly, such as a mantle plume. However, the differences between the \n\nvolumes erupted onshore and offshore must be related to different lithospheric \n\nthicknesses in these two domains, since larger volumes of decompression melting are \n\npossible under the thinner oceanic and transitional lithospheres than under the thicker \n\ncontinental lithosphere. Also, the Iberian plate kinematics and pre-existing structure \n\nmust have played a major role in controlling the timing and location of this magmatism, \n\nthus explaining the absence of a spatial age progression and the scattered location of the \n\nintrusive and extrusive features. \n\nMineral chemistry data (e.g reverse zoning) indicates that magma mixing \n\nbetween liquids of basic/ultrabasic and intermediate natures took place at upper \n\nmantle/lower crustal depths but that does not seem to have greatly affected the \n\ncomposition of the resulting magmas. \n\nThese magmas seem to have ascended to upper crustal levels by taking \n\nadvantage of pre-existing fractures related with Mesozoic rifting and/or the Paleozoic \n\nVariscan orogeny. Many of these occurrences in the western Mesozoic basins seem to \n\nbe related to WNW-ESE to E-W transfer faults that were active during rifting but, their \n\nexact location seems to be controlled by the intersection of these structures with other \n\nalso previously existing fault systems with NE-SW and NNW-SSE orientations.  \n\nAfter emplacement at upper crustal levels, the rocks from both pulses seem to \n\nhave evolved through combined fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, Fe-\n\nTi oxides and more or less plagioclase and amphibole, with assimilation of crustal \n\nlithologies. Fractionation and accumulation of some of these minerals led to specific \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nmajor and trace element characteristics of some of the intrusive rocks, such as the Sines \n\nand Sintra gabbros and the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill. \n\nAssimilation seems to have been an important factor in generating the observed \n\npetrological diversity and in creating the observed radiogenic Sr (87Sr/86Sri up to \n\n0.7049), unradiogenic Nd (?Ndi as low as 3.1) and variable Pb (206Pb/204Pbi and \n208Pb/204Pbi decrease to 18.827 and 38.603, respectively, while 207Pb/204Pbi increases up \n\nto 15.634) signatures seen in the more evolved rocks. Two different contamination \n\ntrends are observed and thus require the existence of two different contaminants. \n\nIncreasing Th/La, Zr/Nb, 87Sr/86Sr, 207Pb/204Pb and K/Nb and decreasing Nb/U, \n206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb towards values closer to crustal compositions with \n\nincreasing SiO2 are related to contamination by a siliceous upper crustal lithology. The \n\nother trend is characterized by only increasing 87Sr/86Sr without causing significant \n\nchanges in other isotopic ratios and is probably related to a Sr rich contaminant that is \n\nsimultaneously depleted in Nd and Pb, which is likely to be of carbonated nature. \n\n \n\nKeywords: intraplate alkaline magmatism; geochronology; geochemistry; \n\npetrogenesis; West Iberian Margin; Late Cretaceous.  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nResumo \n \n\nO magmatismo alcalino do Cret\u00e1cico Superior constitui o mais volumoso dos \n\ntr\u00eas ciclos de actividade magm\u00e1tica que tiveram lugar na Margem Oeste Ib\u00e9rica (MOI) \n\ndurante o Mesoz\u00f3ico. Este ciclo alcalino foi antecedido por um de natureza tole\u00edtica \n\ndurante o Jur\u00e1ssico Inferior (200-198 Ma) e outro de quimismo transicional durante o \n\nJur\u00e1sico Superior-Cret\u00e1cico Inferior (147-142 Ma). \n\nO ciclo alcalino teve lugar num contexto p\u00f3s-rifting, ap\u00f3s o in\u00edcio da \n\noceaniza\u00e7\u00e3o, contempor\u00e2neo da abertura do golfo da Biscaia e consequente rota\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsinistr\u00f3gira de 35\u00ba da Ib\u00e9ria. Coincide tamb\u00e9m com as primeiras fases de invers\u00e3o das \n\nbacias Mesoz\u00f3icas do Algarve e Lusitaniana, que resultam da converg\u00eancia r\u00e1pida das \n\nplacas Ib\u00e9rica, Europeia e Africana, e que se inicia no final do Cret\u00e1cico. \n\nEm terra, este ciclo encontra-se representado pelos complexos \u00edgneos intrusivo \n\nde Sintra, Sines e Monchique, pelo Complexo Vulc\u00e2nico de Lisboa, e por uma s\u00e9rie de \n\noutras ocorr\u00eancias de menor volume distribu\u00eddas pelas bacias Lusitaniana e do Algarve, \n\ncomo as soleiras da Foz da Fonte e de Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas, o complexo filoniano radial de \n\nMafra, os fil\u00f5es de Oeiras-Cascais e o magmatismo lamprofirico-basanitico do Algarve \n\nlitoral, entre outras. Na parte imersa da margem este ciclo inclui a Crista Madeira-Tore, \n\nv\u00e1rias intrus\u00f5es menores entre a montanha submarina de Tore e/no Espor\u00e3o da \n\nEstremadura e o magmatismo do pico Ormonde no banco do Gorringe.  \n\nA aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de novas data\u00e7\u00f5es U-Pb, 40Ar/39Ar, K-Ar e Rb-Sr permitiu a \n\nactualiza\u00e7\u00e3o da geocronologia das ocorr\u00eancias da parte emersa desta prov\u00edncia o que, \n\nem conjunto com dados previamente publicados, possibilitou um melhor \n\nconstrangimento da sua dura\u00e7\u00e3o, entre 94 e 72 Ma, e a detec\u00e7\u00e3o de dois pulsos \n\nindependentes.  \n\nO primeiro pulso teve lugar entre os 94 e os 88 Ma e est\u00e1 limitado \u00e0s soleiras da \n\nFoz da Fonte e de Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas, que se encontram na bacia Lusitaniana entre N39\u00ba e \n\nN38\u00ba20'. Este pulso \u00e9 contempor\u00e2neo da abertura da ba\u00eda da Biscaia e consequente \n\nrota\u00e7\u00e3o da Ib\u00e9ria (124-80 Ma). \n\nO segundo pulso ocorreu entre os 75-72 Ma, tem uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica \n\nmais abrangente entre a regi\u00e3o de Lisboa (? 39\u00baN) e o Algarve (? 37\u00baN) e teve lugar \n\ndurante as primeiras manifesta\u00e7\u00f5es da orogenia Alpina na MOI, que culminou na \n\ninvers\u00e3o das bacias Mesoz\u00f3icas e na forma\u00e7\u00e3o das cadeias dos Pirin\u00e9us e das B\u00e9ticas. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nA idade obtida para o granito de Sintra (79.2 \u00b1 0.8 Ma), \u00e9 equivalente dentro do \n\nerro anal\u00edtico \u00e0 idade mais antiga adquirida para o sienito (78.3 \u00b1 1.9 Ma, Storetvedt et \n\nal., 1987), mas no entanto \u00e9 mais antigo que as restantes idades K-Ar obtidas para estas \n\nrochas (76.4 \u00b1 1.4 e 76.1 \u00b1 1.1 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987) e para os gabros (74.9 \u00b1 1 \n\nMa Storetvedt et al., 1987). Esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o, quando combinada com as rela\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ncorte observadas entre os corpos intrusivos de diferentes naturezas e dados geof\u00edsicos \n\nadquiridos no maci\u00e7o (gravimetria e ASM), parece indicar que o granito corresponde a \n\num lac\u00f3lito formado numa fase anterior de actividade que \u00e9 por sua vez intru\u00eddo por \n\numa s\u00e9rie magm\u00e1tica de natureza gabr\u00f3ica a sien\u00edtica. \n\nAn\u00e1lises geoqu\u00edmicas de amostras de ambos os pulsos demonstram que estas \n\nrochas derivam de pequenas quantidades de fus\u00e3o parcial (1-6%) de um peridotito \n\ngranat\u00edfero \u00b1 anf\u00edbola enriquecido em elementos incompat\u00edveis e com uma assinatura \n\nisot\u00f3pica relativamente homog\u00e9nea, e compat\u00edvel com fonte(s) mant\u00e9lica(s) sub-\n\nlitosf\u00e9rica(s) carcterizada(s) por baixo Rb/Sr, e alto Sm/Nd e U/Pb, integrados no \n\ntempo..  \n\nNo entanto, existem diferen\u00e7as importantes entre as rochas dos dois pulsos no \n\nque respeita aos padr\u00f5es de elementos incompat\u00edveis. As amostras do segundo pulso \n\nmostram anomalias negativas em K, Zr, Hf e por vezes Ti, que est\u00e3o ausentes nas \n\namostras que representam magmas n\u00e3o fraccionados do primeiro pulso. Estas anomalias \n\nestar\u00e3o relacionadas com um evento metassom\u00e1tico que ter\u00e1 afectado o manto na regi\u00e3o \n\nda MOI entre os dois pulsos. O agente metassom\u00e1tico \u00e9 provavelmente de natureza \n\ncarbonat\u00edtica a siliciosa rica em vol\u00e1teis (CO2+H2O) que, entre outros efeitos ter\u00e1 \n\npromovido a estabilidade de anf\u00edbola. A anf\u00edbola n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma fase est\u00e1vel \u00e0s temperaturas \n\nque caracterizam a astenosfera ou as plumas mant\u00e9licas e como tal, a presen\u00e7a de \n\nanomalias negativas de K ser\u00e1 indicativa da interac\u00e7\u00e3o dos magmas sub-litosf\u00e9ricos em \n\nascens\u00e3o com dom\u00ednio(s) metassomatizado(s) da litosfera ou da fus\u00e3o desses mesmos \n\ndom\u00ednios. Esta assinatura metassom\u00e1tica \u00e9 mais not\u00f3ria nas rochas derivadas de \n\nmenores quantidades de fus\u00e3o parcial, tornando-se progressivamente mais dilu\u00edda com o \n\naumento do grau de fus\u00e3o. \n\nN\u00e3o se observam varia\u00e7\u00f5es sistem\u00e1ticas na composi\u00e7\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica entre as rochas \n\ncom uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o metassom\u00e1tica evidente (2\u00ba pulso) e as que n\u00e3o apresentam esse \n\ncomponente (1\u00ba pulso), sugerindo que a litosfera metassomatizada ter\u00e1 herdado a \n\nassinatura isot\u00f3pica e elementar do agente metassom\u00e1tico e que este agente \n\nprovavelmente ter\u00e1 tido a mesma origem dos magmas sublitosf\u00e9ricos do primeiro pulso. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nAs diferen\u00e7as nas abund\u00e2ncias de elementos tra\u00e7o entre os dois pulsos ter\u00e3o sido \n\nent\u00e3o criadas por um epis\u00f3dio metassom\u00e1tico cuja ocorr\u00eancia poder\u00e1 estar relacionada \n\ncom os diferentes contextos geodin\u00e2micos vigentes durante cada pulso. Durante o \n\nprimeiro pulso, a rota\u00e7\u00e3o da Ib\u00e9ria ter\u00e1 eventualmente criado um campo de tens\u00f5es \n\nfavor\u00e1vel \u00e0 abertura de fracturas e \u00e0 ascens\u00e3o r\u00e1pida dos magmas, enquanto que a partir \n\ndos 80 Ma, o inicio da colis\u00e3o entre as placas Ib\u00e9rica, Africana e Europeia ter\u00e1 \n\nrestringido a abertura de fracturas dificultando a ascens\u00e3o magm\u00e1tica e favorecendo \n\nassim a interac\u00e7\u00e3o dos magmas em ascens\u00e3o com a litosfera. \n\nOs magmas n\u00e3o contaminados do ciclo alcalino t\u00eam assinaturas isot\u00f3picas \n\n(87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7\u20133.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-\n15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00) que apontam para uma fonte sublitosf\u00e9rica, distinta \n\ndas dos ciclos tole\u00edtico e transicional que o precederam, e que apresentam uma clara \n\ncontribui\u00e7\u00e3o litosf\u00e9rica. Estas composi\u00e7\u00f5es isot\u00f3picas s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m muito semelhantes \u00e0s \n\napresentadas pelas rochas derivadas da fus\u00e3o da pluma das Can\u00e1rias. Reconstitui\u00e7\u00f5es \n\npaleogeogr\u00e1ficas e dados de paleomagnetismo indicam que durante o Cret\u00e1cico \n\nSuperior a MOI estaria localizada nas proximidades da pluma das Can\u00e1rias, que poder\u00e1 \n\nportanto ser considerada a fonte prov\u00e1vel para os magmas e agentes metassom\u00e1ticos \n\naqui identificados e estudados. \n\nO elevado volume de magmatismo produzido nas regi\u00f5es imersa e emersa da \n\nMOI durante o Cret\u00e1cico Superior \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m compat\u00edvel com uma origem a partir de \n\numa anomalia quente e profunda como uma pluma mant\u00e9lica. Neste contexto, as \n\ndiferen\u00e7as entre o volume de magma gerado em terra e na parte submarina devem estar \n\nrelacionadas a diferen\u00e7as na espessura litosf\u00e9rica entre estes dois dom\u00ednios. A menor \n\nespessura litosf\u00e9rica na regi\u00e3o imersa permitir\u00e1 maiores quantidades de fus\u00e3o parcial \n\npor descompress\u00e3o do que na regi\u00e3o emersa onde a litosfera ser\u00e1 mais espessa, o que \n\nlimita o volume de magma gerado. Adicionalmente, a cinem\u00e1tica da placa Ib\u00e9rica e a \n\nestrutura pr\u00e9 existente dever\u00e1 ter tido um papel fundamental no controlo da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nespacial e temporal deste magmatismo, o que explicar+a a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o dispersa das \n\nocorr\u00eancias magm\u00e1ticas e a aus\u00eancia de uma progress\u00e3o espacial das idades neste \n\nepis\u00f3dio. \n\nOs dados de qu\u00edmica mineral (e.g. zonamentos inversos) apontam para a \n\nocorr\u00eancia de mistura entre magmas de natureza b\u00e1sica/ultrab\u00e1sica e interm\u00e9dia a \n\nprofundidades correspondentes ao manto superior ou crosta inferior, embora este evento \n\nn\u00e3o pare\u00e7a ter afectado significativamente a composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos magmas da\u00ed resultantes. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nEstes magmas parecem ter ascendido at\u00e9 n\u00edveis correspondentes \u00e0 crosta \n\nsuperior atrav\u00e9s de fracturas pr\u00e9 existentes herdadas do rifting Mesoz\u00f3ico e/ou da \n\norogenia Varisca. Muitas das ocorr\u00eancias nas bacias Mesoz\u00f3icas ocidentais parecem \n\nrelacionadas com falhas de transfer\u00eancia WNW-ESE a E-W que estiveram activas \n\ndurante o rifting, ainda que a sua localiza\u00e7\u00e3o exacta pare\u00e7a ter sido condicionada pela \n\nintersec\u00e7\u00e3o destas estruturas com outros sistemas de falhas pr\u00e9 existentes de direc\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nNE-SW a NNW-SSE. \n\nAp\u00f3s a instala\u00e7\u00e3o na crosta superior, as rochas de ambos os pulsos parecem ter \n\nevolu\u00eddo atrav\u00e9s dos processos de cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o fraccionada de olivina, clinopiroxena, \n\n\u00f3xidos de Fe-Ti e mais ou menos plagioclase e anf\u00edbola, em conjunto com a assimila\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde litologias crustais. A fracciona\u00e7\u00e3o e acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns destes minerais levou \u00e0 \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de cumulados com assinaturas elementares espec\u00edficas, como as rochas \n\ngabr\u00f3icas de Sintra e Sines e as diferentes litologias da soleira de Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas. \n\nA assimila\u00e7\u00e3o crustal parece ter desempenhado um papel importante na gera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda diversidade petrol\u00f3gica observada, sendo respons\u00e1vel pelas assinaturas com Sr \n\nradiog\u00e9nico (87Sr/86Sri at\u00e9 0.7049), Nd menos radiog\u00e9nico (?Ndi at\u00e9 3.1) e Pb vari\u00e1vel \n\n(206Pb/204Pbi e 208Pb/204Pbi descem para 18.827 e 38.603, respectivamente, enquanto que \n207Pb/204Pbi sobe at\u00e9 15.634) nas rochas mais evolu\u00eddas.

Objectives \n \n \nThis study concerns the post rift Late Cretaceous alkaline intraplate magmatism \n\nof the West Iberian Margin. The work that culminated in this dissertation was integrated \n\nin the MAGMAFLUX (POCTI/CTA/48450/2002) project. \n\nThe main objectives of this work were: i) the re-evaluation of the geochronology \n\nof the alkaline intrusions; ii) the understanding of the petrogenesis of the alkaline rocks; \n\niii) to reach a better understanding between the deep lithospheric and/or asthenospheric \n\nand shallow crustal control of the origin and emplacement of the alkaline intrusions; iv) \n\nto evaluate the extent of the onshore alkaline magmatism in the Lisbon region towards \n\nthe offshore along the Estremadura Spur. \n\nThe re-evaluation of the geochronology of this magmatic event was carried out \n\nin order to improve its temporal resolution in the context of the evolution of Iberia \n\nduring the Late Cretaceous. This was done by the acquisition of new ages using the U-\n\nPb, Ar-Ar, K-Ar and Rb-Sr isotopic dating methods on a series of whole rock and \n\nmineral separate samples.  \n\nAfter careful sampling of representative lithologies of the main igneous Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline features of the WIM, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data and elemental whole \n\nrock geochemistry, along with the chemical characterization of the major mineral \n\nphases, allowed for the characterization of the sources and processes that generated \n\nthese magmas, together with those that controlled their evolution.  \n\nThe Fontanelas seamount was identified as one of the magnetic anomalies \n\npresent between the Sintra complex and the Tore seamount based on inspection of \n\nmultibeam bathymetry and offshore magnetic anomaly maps. The study of this \n\nseamount allowed for the understanding of the extension of the intraplate alkaline \n\nmagmatism as far as 100 km offshore and at depths of 1500 m below sea level. \n\nAll these data were integrated, along with previously published information on \n\nother Late Cretaceous alkaline occurrences in the region and concerning the \n\ngeodynamic evolution of Iberia during this period, in a model that characterizes the \n\ntectono-magmatic evolution of the passive West Iberian Margin during the Late \n\nCretaceous in a broader Iberian geodynamic context. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n2. Introduction and geological setting \n \n \n\nThe Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism (fig. 2.1) that took place in the \n\nemerged part of the West Iberian Margin (WIM) is materialized by the Sintra, Sines and \n\nMonchique subvolcanic complexes, the Lisbon Volcanic Complex (LVC), among other \n\nminor intrusions and has attracted the attention of both Portuguese (e.g. Costa and \n\nMachado, 1929; Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, 1937; Matos Alves, 1964; Pal\u00e1cios, 1985; Martins, 1991) \n\nand international (e.g. Kaiser, 1914; Rock, 1982, Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997) \n\ngeologists since the 19th century. \n\nHowever, despite the abundant geochemical and mineralogical studies \n\nundertaken in the past decades (e.g.  Sintra \u2013 Matos Alves, 1964; Leal, 1990, 1991, \n\nPal\u00e1cios et al., 1999; Sines \u2013 Canilho, 1972, Martins and Oliven\u00e7a 1998; Monchique \u2013 \n\nRock, 1977, 1982; LVC \u2013 , Pal\u00e1cios, 1985), the characterization of the source(s) and \n\ngeodynamic processes responsible for the genesis of this magmatism remains \n\nincomplete due to the scarcity of available isotopic data. The exception is the \n\nMonchique complex, for which an important isotopic dataset exists, allowing for the \n\nexistence of reasonably well constrained genetic models (Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; \n\nValadares, 2004). \n\nRecent studies in the Sintra complex based on structural geology, gravimetry \n\nand anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (Kullberg and Kullberg, 2000, Terrinha et \n\nal., 2003), detailed geological mapping of the Monchique complex (Clavijo and \n\nValadares, 2003, Valadares, 2004) and anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility work \n\nmade on dykes of the Mafra Radial Dyke Complex (Nogueira, 2008) have shed some \n\nlight on the emplacement mechanisms of these intrusions. However, the level of \n\nunderstanding of these mechanisms regarding the other intrusions and their relationship \n\nwith the observed chemical compositions is very limited, which combined with the \n\naforementioned insufficiencies in terms of available geochemical data, renders the \n\ncurrently available models for the late Cretaceous geodynamical evolution of the West \n\nIberian Margin rather incomplete.   \n\nMeanwhile, in the immersed part of the WIM and neighbouring oceanic crust a \n\nseries of additional seamounts of igneous, basic to intermediate, alkaline nature have \n\nbeen identified, studied, and likewise dated as Late Cretaceous. Among these are the \n\nOrmonde peak in the Gorringe Bank (Auzende et al., 1978, Cornen 1982, Bernard-\n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nGriffiths et al., 1997), as well as several seamounts of the Madeira-Tore Rise \n\n(Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.1: Map of the alkaline igneous occurrences in the West Iberian Margin.  \n\n   \n\nFurthermore, a series of magnetic anomalies forming a WNW-ESE alignment \n\nfrom the Sintra complex to the Tore seamount have been detected (e.g. Silva, 2000, fig. \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n2.18). These anomalies might correspond to further alkaline igneous activity. A \n\ndredging operation in the vicinity of one of these anomalies yielded an ankaramite that \n\nwas dated with an age of 74 Ma (Mougenot, 1989). \n\nThe Amp\u00e9re and Coral Patch seamounts that bound the southern part of the \n\nHorseshoe Abyssal Plain are also of alkaline nature but are of Oligocene age \n\n(Matveyenkov et al., 1994 in Geldmacher et al., 2000).  \n\nNevertheless, the joint existence of both onshore and offshore alkaline igneous \n\nrocks during the Late Cretaceous that lack a clear spatial age progression has never been \n\nproperly addressed and the relationship between them remains unknown.  \n\nAlthough this event was included in very large provinces such as the Circum-\n\nMediterranean Cenozoic Anorogenic Igneous Province (Lustrino and Wilson, 2007) and \n\nthe Peri-Atlantic Alkaline Pulse (Matton and J\u00e9brak, 2009), both of which group rocks \n\nwith very different locations and ages, the mechanisms for magma genesis provided by \n\nthese authors are of general nature and do not take into account the geodynamic \n\nparticularities of the Late Cretaceous in Iberia, which will be addressed in more detail in \n\nthe section below. \n\n \n\n2.1 Iberia during the Cretaceous  \n\nThe beginning of the Mesozoic era was marked by the onset of tectonic \n\nextension in the Early Triassic which marked the end of the Paleozoic Variscan orogeny \n\nand the breakup of Pangea, resulting in rifting in the Algarve and Lusitanian basins (e.g. \n\nPinheiro et al., 1996, Terrinha, 1998, Rasmussen et al., 1998, Kullberg, 2000).  \n\nBy the end of the Early Cretaceous both the Lusitanian and Algarve basins \n\nsuffered their last rifting event. In the Lusitanian basin this event started in the Late \n\nJurassic (Tithonian-Barremian) and is characterized by angular unconformities between \n\nthe Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits and by a change from marine carbonate \n\nsedimentation to siliciclastic continental sedimentation (Rasmussen et al., 1998). This \n\nunconformity was caused by thermal uplift exceeding the isostatic subsidence induced \n\nby the lithospheric stretching during this rifting phase (Rasmussen et al., 1998). The last \n\nrifting event in the Algarve basin is probably of Albian age (Terrinha, 1998).  \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\nRifting ended and was followed by oceanization and formation of oceanic crust \n\nin the WIM, with no evidence of significant syn-rift volcanism (Pinheiro et al., 1996), \n\nwhich classifies this margin as non volcanic (e.g. White and McKenzie, 1989).  \n\nThe most landward magnetic anomaly detected in the Tagus Abyssal Plain \n\ncorresponds to M11, placing the onset of seafloor spreading at approximately 133 Ma, \n\nin Hauteverian times (Pinheiro et al., 1996). On the Iberian Abyssal Plain the first \n\nmagnetic anomaly to be detected corresponds to M3, which places the beginning of \n\noceanization at 126 Ma, in the Barremian (Pinheiro et al., 1996), while in the Galicia \n\nBanks region the beginning of seafloor spreading is dated by the breakup unconformity \n\nas late Aptian, near the Aptian/Albian, boundary around 112 Ma (Pinheiro et al., 1996). \n  \n\n \nFig. 2.2: Magnetic anomaly map of the reconstruction of the positions of Iberia and  Grand \n\nbanks at chron M0 (118-124 Ma).TAP \u2013 Tagus Abyssal Plain, IAP \u2013 Iberian Abyssal Plain, GB \n\n\u2013 Galicia Banks, FC - Flemish Cap,  BB \u2013 Bay of Biscay, FPB Flemish Pass Basin. From Sibuet \n\net al., 2007. \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nHowever, it has been recently proposed that these first magnetic anomalies are \n\nnot the result of ocean crust formation but of serpentinization of exhumed continental \n\nsublithospheric mantle during extension (Sibuet et al., 2007). In this model, the \n\nformation of oceanic crust started only in the J (M0-M3) anomaly, around 118-124 Ma \n\nand the last rifting phase lasted until the Aptian/Albian boundary (Sibuet et al., 2007). \n\nThe Cretaceous in Iberia was also characterized by the opening of the Bay of \n\nBiscay, which started between magnetic anomalies M0 and M3 (118 Ma 124 Ma), \n\nending in chron A33o (80 Ma, Campanian) (Sibuet et al., 2004). This subject is still \n\nunder intense debate and several different models have been proposed. \n\nThe formation of the Bay of Biscay resulted on a counter clockwise rotation of \n\nthe Iberian plate of roughly 35\u00ba, first detected in paleomagnetic data collected by van \n\nder Voo (1969) who constrained it to having occurred between the Triassic and the Late \n\nCretaceous. Galdeano et al. (1989) studied the paleomagnetic properties of sediments \n\nfrom the Lisbon area and proposed a counter clockwise rotation of 27\u00ba between the \n\nHauteverian (136-130 Ma) and the Barremian (130-125 Ma), followed by a second \n\nrotation in the same sense of 14\u00ba from 110 Ma to today. Moreau et al. (1997) presented \n\ndata collected in sedimentary rocks from the Algarve basin and identified one quick \n\nanticlockwise rotation phase of 22\u00ba during the Barremian. Paleomagnetic data from \n\nigneous rocks in continental Portugal collected by M\u00e1rton et al. (2004) indicate a \n\nrotation of 26\u00ba in the same sense between the Toarcian (ca. 180 Ma) and the extrusion \n\nof the Lisbon Volcanic Complex (72 Ma, Ferreira and Macedo, 1979). Other data \n\ncollected in igneous intrusions in Portugal and France by Storetvedt et al. (1987) show a \n\n40\u00ba counter clockwise rotation of Iberia between 90 and 75 Ma based on the K-Ar they \n\nobtained for the same intrusions and a second clockwise rotation of the same magnitude \n\nbetween the end of the Cretaceous and the present day, associated with compressive \n\nalpine tectonics. In two subsequent publications Storetvedt et al., (1990, 1999) detect a \n\nfirst 40\u00ba counter clockwise rotation phase between 90 and 75 Ma, followed by a rotation \n\nof 70\u00ba in the opposite sense in the Campanian (75Ma), these data are, however, hard to \n\nreconcile with geological observations. The most recently published paleomagnetic data \n\nlimits the duration of the previously identified 35\u00ba anti clockwise rotation to the Aptian \n\n(125-112 Ma, Gong et al., 2008), with that rotation progressing at a faster rate during \n\nthe early Aptian relatively to the rest of that age. \n\nDespite some spread, most paleomagnetic data seems to point to an \n\napproximately 35\u00ba rotation centered around the Barremian and Aptian. \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.3: Evolution of the Iberian plate during the Cretaceous. From Rosembaum et al., 2002. \n\n \n\nDuring the opening of the Bay of Biscay, extension comes to an end in the \n\nexistent sedimentary basins in Pyrenean region while new basins are formed in a \n\ntranstensional regime due to the left strike-slip movement between the Iberian and \n\nEurasian plates along the North Pyrenean fault (Sibuet et al., 2004). Contemporaneously \n\nto this movement metamorphic and magmatic events took place in the pull-apart basins \n\nresulting in the incorporation of lherzolitic mantle material and intrusion of small \n\nigneous bodies in the previously mentioned basins between 105 and 85 Ma (Fabri\u00e8s et \n\nal., 1998; Montigny et al., 1986). Also, in the Catalan ranges the small volume alkaline \n\nmagmatism occurred between 82 and 69 Ma (Sol\u00e9 et al., 2003), while in Galicia rare \n\ndykes of similar age (96-87 Ma, Ancochea et al., 1992) have been identified. In the \n\nBasque-Cantabrian basin, alkaline pillow lavas sills and stocks are intercalated with \n\nsediments of Late Cretaceous age (Upper Albian-Santonian) and appear to be related \n\nwith an extensional episode in the same basin (Carracedo et al., 1992).  \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n \nFig. 2.4: Palaeogeographic maps of depositional environments for selected times of the late Early and \n\nLate Cretaceous. Notice the uplift and exposure of the bloc south of the Nazar\u00e9 fault contemporaneously \n\nwith alkaline magmatism in the Campanian. Adapted from Dinis et al., 2008. \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nIn the western Bay of Biscay - Cantabrian region, subduction took place between \n\nthe Campanian and the Miocene (Sibuet et al., 2004), while in the Pyrenees, subduction \n\nensued in two different phases, from the Aptian to the Santonian in the south and from \n\nthe Campanian to the Miocene, in the north (Sibuet et al., 2004).  \n\nAfter oceanic break up and for the remainder of the Lower Cretaceous, the \n\nLusitanian basin went through a phase of generalised subsidence caused by the thermal \n\nrelaxation of the lithosphere, resulting in fault controlled fluvial sedimentation. During \n\nthe Early Cretaceous-Late Cretaceous transition, a generalized marine transgression \n\npromoted the deposition of carbonates until the end of the Cenomanian when it was \n\ninterrupted by the uplift of the crustal block limited by the Nazar\u00e9 and Arr\u00e1bida faults \n\n(fig. 2.4, Proen\u00e7a da Cunha and Pena dos Reis, 1995; Dinis et al., 2008). \n\nThis uplift, which is contemporaneous with the installation of the Sintra igneous \n\ncomplex and the extrusion of the Lisbon Volcanic Complex, is thought to be the cause \n\nof the erosion of approximately 300m of Cretaceous sediments inferred from the \n\ncomparison between the thickness of onshore and offshore deposits (Rasmussen et al., \n\n1998).  \n\nThe tectonic inversion of the Mesozoic Lusitanian and Algarve basins started as \n\nearly as the Late Cretaceous, as a consequence of the onset of rapid collision and even \n\nsubduction between the Iberian, Eurasian and African plates (Mougenot, 1980; \n\nTerrinha, 1998, Rosembaum et al., 2002) but reached its climax during the Miocene in \n\nthe Lusitanian Basin and offshore WIM (Ribeiro et al., 1990, Kullberg et al., 2000, \n\nNeves et al., 2009). However, the Algarve Basin experienced the compressive effects of \n\nthe Africa-Iberia convergence mainly during the latest Cretaceous through Oligocene-\n\nEarly Miocene times (Terrinha, 1998).  \n\nMeanwhile, central Iberia was affected by thermal metamorphism events that \n\nresulted in the formation  of hydrothermal Hg deposits in the Iberian Ranges (Espad\u00e1n \n\ndeposits) dated around 85 Ma (Tritlla and Sol\u00e9, 1999) and low degree thermal \n\nmetamorphism in the Cameros basin, which occurred between 105 and 86 Ma (Casquet \n\net al., 1992 in Casas-Sainz and Gil-Imaz, 1998). \n\nMoreover, the WIM was the locus of important magmatic activity of transitional \n\nand alkaline affinities during the Cretaceous. The transitional magmatism took place \n\nwithin the Lusitanian basin and is commonly associated with diapiric structures \n\n(Martins, 1991) and spans from the latest Jurassic to the earliest Cretaceous (147-141 \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nMa, Grange et al., 2008; Alves, 2010). This event has been attributed to the melting of \n\nmetasomatized mantle during a phase of high lithospheric thinning associated with the \n\nongoing rifting and is characterized by relatively high 87Sr/86Sr and low 206Pb/204Pb and \n207Pb/204Pb (87Sr/86Sri 0.704441\u20130.706462; ?Ndi 3.2-0.6; 206Pb/204Pb 18.418\u201318.978; \n\n207Pb/204Pb 15.594\u201315.925, Grange et al., 2008; Alves et al., 2010).  \n\nThe Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism, represented by the igneous rocks \n\nmentioned earlier (see fig. 2) is the main subject of this dissertation and will be \n\nthoroughly described and discussed later in this work. \n\nAlthough the conjugate West Iberian and Newfoundland margins are commonly \n\nused as examples of amagmatic margins that suffered non volcanic rifting (e.g. White \n\nand McKenzie, 1989), a series of small intrusions of Cretaceous age have been \n\nidentified on the stretched and faulted lithosphere present on the offshore WIM, in \n\nperidotite ridges in the Galicia banks and the Iberian Abyssal plain, and also in the \n\nGorringe bank (e.g. Auzende et al., 1978; Boilot et al., 1989; Beslier et al., 1990; Malod \n\net al., 1993; Sch\u00e4rer et al., 1995; Cornen et al., 1999; Sch\u00e4rer et al., 2000; Beard et al., \n\n2002; Chazot et al., 2005). \n\nThe peridotites outcropping in the ridges are interpreted as being part of \n\nexhumed subcontinental lithospheric mantle that has experienced depletion during \n\nseveral previous melt extraction events during the Variscan (e.g. Malod et al., 1993; \n\nCornen et al., 1999; Chazot et al., 2005). They are intruded by late gabbros and dolerites \n\nand can be locally covered by tholeiitic lavas that extruded between the end of rifting \n\nand the high temperature deformation of the peridotite (e.g. Auzende et al., 1978; \n\nBeslier et al., 1990; Boilot et al., 1989; Sch\u00e4rer et al., 1995; Sch\u00e4rer et al., 2000; Beard \n\net al., 2002; Chazot et al., 2005).  \n\nThis magmatic episode lasted from 138 to 121 Ma (U-Pb ages in zircon \n\nseparates, Sch\u00e4rer et al., 2000) and should have preceded continental breakup, with the \n\nyounger rocks being found in the North and the older ones in the South. These rocks \n\nderived mostly from the melting of an asthenospheric, MORB like, LILE (Large Ion \n\nLithophile Element) depleted source, according to their Hf and Nd isotopic signature, \n\nbut with the lower ?Nd values probably being an indication of the involvement of a less \n\nLILE depleted lithospheric component (?Hf  20.5 \u2013 14.0, ?Nd 10.3 \u2013 3.6 Sch\u00e4rer et al., \n\n1995, 2000).  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nThe gabbroic pegmatites found in the peridotite ridges of the Iberian abyssal \n\nplain and studied by Beard et al. (2002) systematically show a more enriched trace \n\nelement and isotopic signature (?Ndi 4.7 \u2013 4.9; 87Sr/86Sri 0.70362 - 0.70463; 206Pb/204Pbi \n\n18.65, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.48, 208Pb/204Pbi 38.3) and are thought to represent melts generated \n\nin the upper lithospheric mantle, probably at shallow depths, in the plagioclase stability \n\nfield during the rifting and unroofing of these peridotites. These tholeiitic MORB-like \n\nmelts are also considered to be responsible for the syn-rift metasomatic event that \n\naffected the subcontinental lithosphere peridotites and refertilized previously depleted \n\nhazburgites by interacting with them and creating different, enriched trace element and \n\nisotopic signatures. These signatures are also observed on the previously described \n\nintrusives contemporary with rifting, which also show evidence for interaction with the \n\nrefertilized lithospheric mantle (Chazot et al., 2005).  \n\nThe clinopyroxene and amphibole separates from lherzolites in the Galicia bank \n\nhave isotopic signatures characterized by radiogenic Nd and unradiogenic Sr \n\n(143Nd/144Nd 0.512804 \u2013 0.513402 87Sr/86Sr 0.702100 - 0. 703887), while pyroxenes \n\nfrom the websterites in the Iberia Abyssal Plain have lower Nd isotopic compositions \n\n(143Nd/144Nd 0.512283 \u2013 0.512553) with higher Sr isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr 0.704170 \u2013 \n\n0.705919) indicating the existence of Cretaceous metasomatic events with different \n\nnatures in these two regions (Chazot et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.5: Summary of the most important geodynamic events in Iberia during the Cretaceous (from \nMiranda et al., 2009). Dates for the limits of the epochs and ages of the Cretaceous period from Gradstein \net al. (2004). Ages from geochronological data in full lines.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n2.2 Magmatism in the conjugate and Newfoundland margin \n\nThe Newfoundland margin constitutes the conjugate margin of the WIM and \n\nseparated from it during the aforementioned rifting process. It encompasses the \n\nMesozoic Jeanne d\u2019Arc, Carson, and Salar-Bonnition basins, and is also a non volcanic \n\n(i.e. free of any significant thickness of volcanic rocks or magmatic underplating, e.g. \n\nTucholke and Sibuet, 2007). As in the WIM, peridotite ridges are present in this margin, \n\nwith the difference that the Newfoundland peridotites (hazburgites) are more depleted \n\nrelative to the ones found in the WIM, due to pre-rift melting events that possibly took \n\nplace in an arc-like environment during a previous orogeny (M\u00fcntener and Manastchal, \n\n2006). \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.6: Reconstitution of the positions of Iberia and the Newfoundland/Grand Banks region at the time \n\nof anomaly M0 (approximately 118-124 Ma). From Tucholke and Sibuet., 2007. Also shown is the \n\nstructure and sedimentary basins of the region as well as the position of the Newfoundland (NFLD) and \n\nTore seamounts. Ages of the oceanic basement, seamounts and sills are from Sullivan and Keen (1977), \n\nPe-Piper et al., 1994; Hart and Blusztajn (2006). \n\n \n\nSmall volume, post-rift alkaline magmatism also took place in this margin and is \n\nrepresented by a series of alkaline sills recently drilled in Site 1276 of Leg 210 of the \n\nOcean Drilling Program (Karner and Shillington, 2005; Hart and Blusztajn, 2006). They \n\nare constituted by more or less altered alkali basalts and hawaiites that intruded between \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n105 and 98 Ma (fig. 2.6) and are enriched in incompatible elements. Their isotopic \n\ncomposition (87Sr/86Sr 0.705898 - 0.706259, 143Nd/144Nd 0.512740 \u2013 0.512598, \n206Pb/204Pb 18.4666 - 20.5031, 207Pb/204Pb 15.5536 - 15.6686, 208Pb/204Pb 37.8681 - \n\n38.4478; Hart and Blusztajn, 2006) suggests the participation of enriched mantle \n\ncomponents in the genesis of these rocks, as well as a possible crustal contribution. This \n\nenriched mantle component may derive from preferential melting of enriched mantle \n\ndomains embedded in depleted MORB mantle or reflect the activity of a mantle plume \n\nin the region that may as well be responsible for the formation of the Milne seamounts \n\nfurther east of this location (Hart and Blusztajn, 2006).  \n\n The Newfoundland seamounts correspond to chain of submarine volcanic peaks \n\nthat positions itself East of the Newfoundland margin. They were extruded in an area \n\nwhich during magnetic anomaly M0 (118-124 Ma) was separated from the Tore \n\nseamount by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, according to paleogeographic reconstructions (e.g. \n\nTucholke and Sibuet, 2007; M\u00fcntener and Manastchal, 2006; Sibuet et al., 2007; fig. \n\n2.6). The data available on these seamounts is scarce but it is known they are constituted \n\nby alkaline basalts and trachytes that were dated around 98 Ma (Sullivan and Keen, \n\n1977 in Pe-Piper et al., 2007). Little else is known about these seamounts except for \n\ntheir ?Ndi value of 4.1 (Sullivan and Keen, 1977 in Pe-Piper et al., 2007) and that they \n\nhave low radiogenic Pb values (Pe-Piper et al., 1994). \n\n Also present in oil exploration wells near this area is an Early Cretaceous \n\nalkaline bimodal suite (135-127 Ma) that is genetically related to the Grand Banks \n\nJurassic transform margin (Pe-Piper et al., 1994). Trace element and isotopic signatures \n\nof the more basic magmas (87Sr/86Sri 0.70350 - 0.70388, 143Nd/144Nd 0.51263 \u2013 \n\n0.51282, 206Pb/204Pb 18.538 - 18.752, 207Pb/204Pb 15.598 - 15.636, 208Pb/204Pb 38.505 - \n\n38.674) suggest that they were generated by melting of the continental lithosphere \n\ninduced by extensional decompression mechanisms along the reactivated transform \n\nmargin. A plume component is also detected in their isotopic signature and a thermal \n\nanomaly related to this possible plume could have supplied the extra heat that allowed \n\nfor the initiation of melting (Pe-Piper et al., 1994). Major faults in the region acted as \n\nmagma conduits, and the rocks further away from the continental margins display \n\nstronger signs of crustal contamination (Pe-Piper et al., 1994), perhaps due to stronger \n\ninteraction with the crust during magma transport. \n\n The southern limit of this margin corresponds to the Newfoundland-Azores-\n\nGibraltar fracture zone, on top of which sit the Fogo seamounts of Late Jurassic to Early \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nCretaceous age (154-130 Ma, Pe-Piper et al., 2007, Fig. 2. 6). This seamount chain is \n\nconstituted by both tholeiitic and alkaline rocks who are thought to have formed from \n\nmagmas generated by decompression melting from ascending asthenosphere as a result \n\nof edge-controlled convection in the upper mantle due to thermal and density gradients \n\nat the transform transition between the spreading ocean and the continental block of the \n\nGrand Banks (Pe-Piper et al., 2007). Pe-Piper et al. (2007) also suggested that thermal \n\neffects of the volcanism promoted mid-crustal partial melting and detachment faulting \n\non the Grand Banks and consequentially the development of the asymmetric Grand \n\nBanks\u2013Iberia rift system.  \n\n \n\n2.3 Late Cretaceous Alkaline magmatic occurrences in the West \n\nIberian Margin: the state of the art \n\nThe Late Cretaceous igneous alkaline activity is the most important Mesozoic \n\nmagmatic event in the WIM in terms of both area and volume. This magmatic activity, \n\ninitially established as having occurred between 100 Ma and 70 Ma, was included in the \n\n4th cycle of Meso-Cenozoic magmatic activity in Portuguese territory by Ferreira and \n\nMacedo (1979). Previous cycles of alkaline with shoshonitic affinities (235-205 Ma), \n\ntholeiitic (ca. 200 Ma) and transitional (ca. 135 Ma) magmatism were proposed by the \n\nsame authors.  \n\nAs was previously mentioned Rock (1982) grouped the Portuguese Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline magmatism along with other occurrences of similar age and \n\ncomposition located around the Pyrenees in the Iberian Late Cretaceous Alkaline \n\nIgneous Province and argued for a close relation between this magmatism and the \n\nopening of the North Atlantic. Martins (1991) integrated the same alkaline episode in \n\nthe third and last cycle of Mesozoic magmatic activity in Portugal, associating it with \n\nthe ascent and melting of asthenospheric mantle as a consequence of the thinning of \n\nlithospheric mantle occurred during the various rifting phases of the WIM. Occurrences \n\nrelated to the first two cycles defined by Martins (1991) display tholeiitic and \n\ntransitional affinities (Martins, 1991; Martins et al., 2008; Grange et al., 2008) and ages \n\naround 200 Ma (e.g. Dunn et al., 1998, Verati et al., 2007) and 130-146 Ma (Ferreira \n\nand Macedo, 1979; Grange et al., 2008), respectively. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nOnshore, the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle includes subvolcanic complexes of \n\nSintra, Sines and Monchique, the Lisbon Volcanic Complex and several other minor \n\nintrusions, such as the Foz da Fonte and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sills, the Mafra radial dyke \n\ncomplex, the Oeiras-Cascais dykes and the lamprophyre-basanite suite of the Algarve \n\ncoast (fig. 2.14). These rocks are discontinuously exposed between parallels 39\u00ba N and \n\n37\u00ba N and cover an area of approximately 325 km2 (fig. 2.8). The Sintra, Sines and \n\nMonchique intrusions are aligned along a NNW-SSE direction, which coincides with \n\nthe trend shown by some rift faults as well as some Variscan structures. \n\nAll the alkaline rocks in the Lisbon area, i.e. north of 38.5\u00baN, were emplaced \n\nwithin the Mesozoic Lusitanian rift basin. The Sines complex sits just east of the \n\nboundary of the Alentejo Basin and in the southern limit of the small Mesozoic \n\nSantiago do Cac\u00e9m basin. The Monchique nepheline syenites were emplaced well into \n\nthe non-rifted Paleozoic basement, while a complex of the coeval dykes and necks were \n\nmapped and dated in the Algarve rift basin (fig. 2.8). \n\nThe alignment of the Sintra, Sines and Monchique Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\ncomplexes has been a matter of intense debate in the past. Ribeiro et al. (1979) \n\nsuggested the complexes were emplaced along a dextral strike-slip fault during the \n\nrotation of Iberia. Mougenot (1980) proposed that these intrusions were emplaced along \n\ncrustal pull-apart strain domains between en echelon faults during tectonic inversion of \n\nthe WIM. Terrinha (1998) and Kullberg (2000) demonstrated the existence of Early-\n\nMiddle Jurassic age sin-rift faults along the lineament and proposed that these faults \n\ncontrolled the magma ascent in the Late Cretaceous, while decompression melting in \n\nreleasing bends on the deep structure allowed for the melt generation (fig. 2.7).  \n\nIn recent times, offshore alkaline magmatic activity has been identified in \n\nthinned continental or oceanic crust between 34.5\u00ba N and 39\u00ba N between the Tore and \n\nLion seamounts in the Madeira-Tore Rise (MTR) and the Ormonde seamount in the \n\nGorringe Bank, totalling a much larger area and volume than its onshore counterpart \n\n(e.g. Cornen, 1982; F\u00e9raud et al., 1982; Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006). \n\nThe relationship between the onshore and offshore occurrences is highly \n\ndebated, with Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997) first proposing a consanguinity relation \n\nbetween the Monchique Massif and the alkaline magmatism of the Gorringe bank, \n\nwhich in turn served as the basis for the proposal that Monchique would represent the \n\noldest known activity of the Madeira hotspot made by Geldmacher and Hoernle (2000).  \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.7: Schematic representation of the mechanisms of generation, ascension and installation of the \nmagmas that constitute the Sintra igneous complex. From Terrinha et al., 2003. \n \n\nThis author later proposed that all the observed magmatism in the offshore WIM \n\ncould be explained by the activity the Madeira and Canaries hotspots and their \n\ninteraction with the late Cretaceous mid Atlantic Ridge (Geldmacher et al., 2006, figs. \n\n2.15, 2.16). Merle et al. (2006, 2009) proposed that the Madeira-Tore seamounts would \n\nbe the result of a long lived and wide mantle thermal anomaly present in the region \n\nduring the Cretaceous that emitted several magmatic pulses. The space\u2013time \n\ndistribution of this magmatism results from the interaction between these pulses and the \n\ncomplex kinematics of the Iberian plate (Merle et al., 2009). \n\nIn his turn, Ribeiro (2002) proposed that the onshore portion of this magmatic \n\nevent could be related to a fracture resulting from a meteorite impact occurred in the \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n \n\nLate Cretaceous, whose crater corresponds to the Tore seamount, but further studies of \n\nthis location do not support this hypothesis (Merle et al., 2006, 2009). \n\nRecently, Sol\u00e9 et al. (2003) proposed that the magmatism assigned to the Late \n\nCretaceous Alkaline Igneous Province of Iberia had been generated by decompression \n\nand intruded the margins of the Iberian plate, where thinning and cortical relaxation had \n\ntaken place during its rotation and contemporaneous opening of the Bay of Biscay. \n\nDespite their older age, Lustrino and Wilson (2007) included these occurrences in \n\nthe Circum-Mediterranean Cenozoic Anorogenic Igneous Province and suggested that \n\nthey could be related to the existence of small passive convective diapiric instabilities in \n\nthe upper mantle where enriched magmas would ascend. These diapiric instabilities \n\nwould lead to the rise of asthenospheric mantle with a similar composition in the entire \n\nregion, which is known as the Common Mantle Reservoir (CMR) which represents a \n\nsublithospheric mantle domain enriched by the recycling of lithospheric material during \n\nsubduction or delamination (Lustrino and Wilson, 2007). \n\n However, it has also been suggested that the constant isotopic composition \n\nobserved in such a large area was the result of a mantle contamination episode during \n\nthe Cretaceous by the same mantle plume responsible by the magmatism of the Central \n\nAtlantic Magmatic Province (Piromallo et al., 2008). For these authors, this deeply \n\nrooted plume is nowadays responsible for the volcanism in the Canaries and Cape \n\nVerde hotspots.  \n\nMore recently, Matton and Jebr\u00e1k (2009) included both the onshore and offshore \n\nintrusions and volcanics of the WIM in the Peri Atlantic Alkaline Pulse (PAAP) along \n\nwith other paired onshore and offshore igneous alkaline rocks along the Atlantic \n\nmargin. They have envisaged a model where edge driven asthenospheric convection and \n\nthe resulting mantle upwelling acted simultaneously with the reorganization of \n\nintraplate stresses and consequential reactivation of deep seated zones of weakness to \n\npromote magma generation through decompression melting and the ascension of the \n\nresulting alkaline magmas to the surface. \n\nIn the following part of this section detailed information about the age, \n\ngeochemistry and emplacement mechanism for each of the studied onshore and offshore \n\nLate Cretaceous alkaline magmatic occurrences will be provided. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\n2.3.1 The onshore West Iberian Margin \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.8: Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism on the onshore WIM. See text for the exact ages. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\n \n\n2.3.1.1 The Sintra igneous complex \n\nThe Sintra igneous complex outcrops approximately 25 km west of Lisbon, \n\nhaving an emerged area of approximately 40 km2. It was also mapped underwater, \n\ntowards the west, where it is thought to occupy a similar area to the one observed on \n\nland.  With a maximum height of over 500 m, it constitutes one of the most prominent \n\ngeomorphological features in the region. \n\nThe complex intrudes Upper Jurassic carbonates and Early Cretaceous \n\nsandstones, forming a ring of contact metamorphism that produced mostly calc-silicate \n\nhornfels and recrystallized sandstones. These lithologies also make up some stoped \n\nblocks observed in the interior of the complex.  \n\nThe complex can be considered as being constituted by three main units, as \n\nfollows: i) the Sintra granite that occupies most of the outcropping area and envelops a \n\nsecond unit, ii) the Cabo da Roca complex, a unit located in the western part of the \n\ncomplex and formed by amphibole rich gabros (mafraites), quartz diorites, quartz \n\nsyenites and igneous breccias (fig. 2.9); note that there is also a small array of altered \n\ngabbroic bodies that outcrop in the northern contact, parallel to the Sintra northern \n\nthrust (fig. 2.9), and iii) the surrounding complex of dykes. \n\nWright (1968) recognised four distinct syenite units and two overlapping ring \n\ncomplexes inside the Cabo da Roca complex, which have different ages, geochemistry \n\nand degrees of contamination, while Sparks and Wadge (1975) identified five syenite \n\nunits and also a stratified sequence of eruptive rocks (from trachybasalts to rhyolites). \n\nThey also classified the some of the breccias as lavas and pyroclastic breccias of the \n\nbasalt-trachyte suite and recognised net veined complexes formed by magma mixing. \n\nBoth Wright (1968) and Sparks and Wadge (1975) argued that the granite pre-dates the \n\nCabo da Roca complex with only Matos Alves (1964) arguing that all the rocks present \n\nin Sintra are co-genetic.  \n\nThe intrusion of the complex was accompanied by the intrusion of a series of \n\nsills and dykes of different compositions that can be divided in radial dykes, cone sheets \n\nand sills (Matos Alves, 1964). The sills are mostly altered, basic to intermediate \n\nporphyritic rocks, which include the sampled Malveira da Serra sill and intrude mostly \n\nin the sedimentary country rock in the southern and eastern flanks of the complex, as are \n\nthe mafic radial dykes that occur in the same area. The cone sheets are mainly felsic to \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nintermediate and are observed mainly in the southern flank of the complex dipping \n\ntowards it (Matos Alves, 1964). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.9: Geological map of the Sintra region. Adapted from Kullberg et al., 2006. \n\n \n\n Geothermobarometric studies on rocks belonging to the intrusion suggest that \n\nthe complex was emplaced at a pressure of 1.5 kb (depth around 5-6 km) and had \n\ncrystallization temperatures between 1100-1000\u00baC for the gabbros and 700\u00baC for the \n\ngranites (Pal\u00e1cios et al., 1995). \n\n Gravimetric data collected in and around the complex points towards distinct \n\ngeometries for the granite and central gabbro-diorite-syenite complexes. The granite has \n\na laccolithic shape being 12 km long , 8 km wide and 1 km thick (Terrinha et al., 2003; \n\nKullberg et al., 2006, 2010). Based on the analysis of gravimetric and anisotropy of the \n\nmagnetic susceptibility data, these authors propose that the granitic magma intruded \n\nthrough conduits with E-W, NE-SW and NNW-SSE directions which were afterwards \n\nreused during the intrusion of the gabbroic to syenitic magmas that show a subvertical \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n \n\nplug like shape reaching depths of 4 km (fig. 2.9B). The NNW-SSE structures were \n\nactive during the Middle Jurassic as rift faults. These faults extend as a fault zone \n\nintruded by a complex of dykes that extends to the south of the Sintra complex until the \n\nArr\u00e1bida chain for more than 40km and were re-worked as a dextral strike-slip faults \n\nduring the Cenozoic tectonic inversion. The E-W faults were also active during the \n\nMesozoic rifting and served as thrusts during tectonic inversion, such as the main Sintra \n\nthrust located in the northern part of the complex (fig. 2.10a,b and c). The NW-SE faults \n\nserved as sinistral strike-slip faults during inversion (fig. 2.2a, 10).  \n\nThe petrogenesis of this complex has been intensely debated along the years and \n\nup to the present (e.g. Matos Alves, 1964; Wright, 1968; Sparks and Wadge, 1975; \n\nLeal, 1990, 1991; Pal\u00e1cios et al., 1995, 1999). Matos Alves (1964) proposed the \n\ngeneration of all the observed lithologies through processes of fractional crystallization \n\nand assimilation of a granitic contaminant by a parental basic undersaturated magma \n\nwith a mafraite like composition. Wright (1968) favoured a model where the granite and \n\nthe gabbro-syenite suite were not comagmatic, with the granite resulting from crustal \n\nanatexis and being emplaced before the gabbros and syenites, which in their turn \n\nresulted from the differentiation and contamination of a basic mafraitic magma by a \n\nmore evolved felsic liquid, leading to enrichment in alumina, alkalis and volatiles. \n\nSparks and Wadge (1975) supported that high pressure garnet and clinopyroxene \n\nfractionation from an hypersthene normative picritic basalt, or partial melting of a \n\nphlogopite rich source at pressures above 15 kb are the mechanisms that might have \n\ngenerated the undersatured basic magmas seen in Sintra and in the Lisbon Volcanic \n\ncomplex, while the syenites and trachytes of the same region should have evolved \n\ndirectly from the hypersthene normative basalts that did not go through high pressure \n\nfractional crystallization. \n\nMore recently, Leal (1990, 1991) analysed petrographic and geochemical data \n\nand concluded that the granite was generated by melting of a felsic rock, probably from \n\nthe Variscan basement, while the other rocks in the complex evolved from the gabbroic \n\nto the syenitic term by fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene, amphibole, \n\nplagioclase and biotite coupled with assimilation of crustal lithologies. The Rare Earth \n\nElement (REE) and incompatible trace element geochemistry also confirms the genetic \n\nlink between gabbros and syenites and implies a more important role for crustal \n\nassimilation in the generation of the granites (Pal\u00e1cios et al., 1999) when compared to \n\nthe syenites. \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.10: Schematic representation of the evolution of the Sintra intrusion. Adapted from Kullberg et al., \n\n2006.   \n\n \n\nConcerning geochronology, the granite has systematically yielded older ages \n\nthan the suite of gabbro-diorite-syenite and associated breccias present in the complex. \n\nAccording to the published data, the emplacement of the granite (85 \u00b1 8 Ma, Rb-Sr, \n\nBonhome et al., 1961; 81.9 \u00b1 0.4 Ma, K-Ar in biotite, MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; 84.0 \n\n\u00b1 1.1, K-Ar in K-feldspar, Storetvedt et al., 1987) occurred before the intrusion of the \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\ngabbro and syenite magmas (76.1 \u00b1 1.1 to  78.3 \u00b1 1.9 Ma, K-Ar in whole rock syenite, \n\nStoretvedt et al., 1987; 74.9 \u00b1 1.0 Ma whole-rock K-Ar in gabbro, Storetvedt et al., \n\n1987). This is compatible with field relations and the geophysical studies that revealed \nthe complex\u2019s structure in depth and show that the gabbroic and syenitic rocks intrude \n\nthe granite (Terrinha et al., 2003; Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010). \n\nThe available Sr isotopic data for the Sintra complex point towards a common \n\norigin for the gabbroic and syenitic magmas (87Sr/86Sr74 = 0.7039 to 0.7042, Mendes, \n\n1968; Abranches and Canilho, 1981) that could correspond to a basic magma with \n\nunradiogenic Sr which was slightly contaminated by a more radiogenic crustal lithology \n\nto produce the syenites. The more radiogenic composition of the granites (87Sr/86Sr80 = \n\n0.7052 to 0.70601 Mendes, 1968; Abranches and Canilho, 1981) favours its generation \n\nby higher amount of crustal contamination of a relatively unradiogenic, probably mantle \n\nderived, magma and not by pure crustal anatexis, due to the observed isotopic values \n\nbeing quite lower than what would be expected for felsic continental crust. \n\nContemporaneously with the tectonic inversion of the Lusitanian basin, the \n\nSintra region suffered substantial deformation, resulting in the development of an E-W \n\nthrust, probably reactivating an older extensional fault, in front of the northern limit of \n\nthe complex which also led to the exhumation of the complex during the Paleogene \n\n(Kullberg et al., 2006). The field evidence is supported by fission-track data on apatites \n\nthat point towards exhumation in Eocene times (Stapel et al., 1996). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.1.2 The Sines igneous complex \n\n The Sines igneous alkaline complex delineates a well defined promontory in the \n\nwestern Portuguese coast, at approximately 38\u00baN (fig. 2.8). It has an onshore \n\noutcropping area of about 6 km2, but most of the complex is covered by Pliocene and \n\nQuaternary littoral deposits and dunes. Its outcrop area in the continental shelf is \n\napproximately the same size of the Sintra submarine part, i.e. roughly 40 km2 \n\n(Monteiro, 1984), increasing the size of the complex while also changing its shape to an \n\nellipse with an WNW-ESE major axis approximately 12 km long and with a minor axis \n\nwith 3.5 km (Inverno et al., 1993).  \n\nThe Sines complex is overlain by Upper Jurassic limestones of the Santiago do \n\nCac\u00e9m Mesozoic basin (part of the Alentejo basin) along its northern boundary, whilst \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\nalong the southern one it is bordered by Carboniferous turbiditic meta-sediments of the \n\nMira Formation (Namurian; Oliveira, 1990). The intrusion produced a contact aureole \n\nthat includes calcic and pelitic hornfels. It is associated with the formation of a dense \n\ndyke complex that shows a very wide range of lithologies, from basic to intermediate \n\nand acid (lamprophyres, pyroxenites, basalts, microdiorites, trachybasalts, trachytes, \n\nmicrosyenites, microgranites) and occur in all directions although N-S and E-W \n\ndominate  (Canilho, 1972).  \n\n  \n\n \n\nFig. 2.11: Geological map of the Sines complex. S \u2013 syenites; G \u2013 gabbros and diorites. \n\n \n\nInside the complex, the main outcropping rocks are quartz syenites, diorites and \n\ngabbros both of the amphibole rich variety observed in Sintra (South, at Vasco da Gama \n\nbeach) or of an another olivine rich and amphibole poorer variety that appears to show \n\nsome banding (North, in Pedras de Sal). All these rocks are cut by the previously \n\nmentioned dyke complex. \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\n The Sines complex was also subject to several dating attempts using the K-Ar \n\nand Rb-Sr methods. The wide range of displayed \"ages\" (78.9 \u00b1 1.5 to 62.0 \u00b1 1.3 Ma K-\n\nAr in whole rock diabase dykes; 75.2 \u00b1 0.8 to 63.8 \u00b1 0.8 Ma K-Ar age in K-feldspar \n\nfrom the syenite; 72.0 \u00b1 1.5 Rb-Sr whole rock isochron, Canilho and Abranches, 1982), \n\nparticularly the values below 70 Ma are probably the result of a late thermal overprint \n\nthat may have caused argon loss (Storetvedt et al., 1987) and its central age should be \n\nsomewhere between 72 and 75 Ma. \n\nThe incompatible element enriched nature of the more basic magmas, jointly \n\nwith the observed negative K anomalies in primitive mantle normalized incompatible \n\nelement diagrams and light REE enrichment ((La/Yb)n = 17.25 \u2013 3.29) and low initial \n87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70331, Canilho e Abranches, 1982)  suggest that the basic magmas \n\nwere the result of small volume partial melting in the presence of  residual garnet and a \n\nK-rich phase (possibly phlogopite or amphibole) of a mantle source enriched in \n\nincompatible elements but with a time integrated Sr depletion, with a possible affinity \n\nwith the HIMU mantle component (Martins and Oliven\u00e7a, 1998). \n\n As for the generation of the remaining observed lithologies, it has been proposed \n\nthat a common basic source represented by the gabbros then generated the diorites and \n\nsyenites by fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, amphibole and \n\nplagioclase in a closed system (Canilho, 1972; Martins and Oliven\u00e7a, 1998). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.1.3 The Monchique igneous complex \n\n The Monchique igneous alkaline complex is located in the Western Algarve, has \n\nan approximately elliptical shape and occupies an area of about 80 km2. It is formed by \n\ntwo concentric nepheline syenite bodies, with associated lamprophyre dykes and \n\nbreccias enclosing small mafic to ultramafic rock outcrops (Rock, 1978; Gonzalez-\n\nClavijo and Valadares, 2003; Valadares, 2004). It intrudes the Paleozoic South \n\nPortuguese Zone, namely Carboniferous shales and quartzitic sandstones of the Brejeira \n\nFormation (Middle Namurian\u2013Early Westphallian; Oliveira, 1990) that underwent \n\nearlier Variscan metamorphism. The intrusion produced a 200 m thick contact \n\nmetamorphism aureole. This is the most voluminous of the southern alkaline intrusions \n\nand has the particular characteristics of being the only one emplaced exclusively in \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nrocks of Paleozoic age that remained unaffected by Mesozoic rifting, and to show a \n\nsilica undersaturated character for its entire lithological spectrum. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.12: Geological map of the Monchique igneous complex. From Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, \n\n2003. \n\n \n\nRecent revision of the geological mapping of this complex allowed the \n\nidentification of two concentric units of different nepheline syenites, the inner of which \n\nencloses various bodies of basic and ultra-basic rocks (fig. 2.12; Gonzalez-Clavijo and \n\nValadares, 2003). These authors also proposed an intrusion mechanism where basic \n\nmagmas initially ascended through pre-existing ENE-WSW faults that were reactivated \n\nduring a Cretaceous extensional regime. They were followed by the emplacement of \n\nseveral heterogenous nepheline syenite bodies that ascended through the same conduits, \n\nand were afterwards followed by a last pulse characterized by the ascension of the \n\nhomogenous nepheline syenite body that intrudes all of the previous ones (fig. 2.13; \n\nGonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, 2003). \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.13: Diagram illustrating the installation mechanism proposed by Clavijo and Valadares (2003) for \n\nthe Monchique igneous complex.  \n  \n\nThe Monchique complex has been dated with both the K-Ar and the Rb-Sr \n\nmethod (table 1), with the obtained ages clustering around 72 Ma (72.0 \u00b1 2.0 mean K-\n\nAr ages on mineral separates, MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; 72.0 Ma Rb-Sr whole rock \n\nisochron, Rock, 1976, Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, 2004), although the K-\n\nAr ages obtained for K-feldspar and nepheline separates show some spread, attributed to \n\nAr loss (MacIntyre and Berger, 1982). \n\nThe geochemical evolution of the complex appears to have happened through \n\nfractional crystallization of clinopyroxene, magnetite, kaersutite, titanite and apatite \n\nfrom an initial basic magma represented by the mafic and ultramafic rocks in the \n\ncomplex (Valadares, 2004). That primary magma must have derived from the low \n\nvolume partial melting of a mantle source enriched in incompatible elements and in the \n\npresence of residual garnet ((La/Yb)n = 20.9 to 29.1) and a K-rich phase (probably \n\namphibole or phlogopite) similar to the one proposed for the Sines igneous complex. \n\nThe isotopic signatures for these rocks show unradiogenic initial Sr (87Sr/86Sr72 ? 0.703, \n\nBernard Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, 2004), high ?Nd (?Nd72 4.3 - 5.6, Bernard \n\nGriffiths et al., 1997) values and a Pb isotopic signature (206Pb/204Pb72 - 19.13 to 19.42; \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\n207Pb/204Pb72 - 15.61 to 15.64; 208Pb/204Pb72 - 38.8 to 39.2; Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997) \n\nthat plots on the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line (NHRL; Hart, 1984).  \n\nThese isotopic characteristics, together with the silica undersaturation, and the \n\nabsence of negative Nb and Ta anomalies in the Monchique rocks, exclude the \n\nhypothesis of crustal contamination playing a major role on the generation and \n\nevolution of this rock suite and allow the deduction that these resulted from the partial \n\nmelting of an asthenospheric mantle reservoir of the PREMA (the Prevalent Mantle of \n\nZindler and Hart, 1986) type (Bernard Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, 2004), although \n\nsome interaction with the overlying lithospheric mantle is thought to have had a minor \n\nrole in enriching the Monchique magmas in light REE, consequentially lowering its ?Nd \n\nwhen compared with the nearby alkaline and possibly cogenetic magmatism in the \n\nOrmonde seamount (Bernard Griffiths et al., 1997) \n\nIt has been proposed that the Monchique complex is part of a possible Madeira \n\nhotspot track before it was ~200 km displaced to the West through right lateral offset \n\nalong the Azores\u2013Gibraltar Fracture zone (Geldmacher and Hoernle, 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.1.4 The Lisbon Volcanic Complex \n\nThe Lisbon Volcanic Complex (LVC) is an intrusive and extrusive event \n\nconstituted by a series of volcanic necks, lava flows, breccias, plugs, dykes and sills, \n\noccupying a total area of approximately 200 km2 (fig. 2.14). Their composition is \n\nmostly basaltic (s.l.), although intermediate and acid terms are also present \n\n(trachybasalts, trachytes and rhyolites) but correspond to a much smaller volume \n\n(Pal\u00e1cios, 1985). It is the most recent known alkaline occurrence in the Lusitanian Basin \n\n(72 \u00b1 3 Ma; K-Ar isochron by Ferreira and Macedo, 1979) and outcrops in the block \n\nlimited by the Nazar\u00e9 and Arr\u00e1bida faults, more specifically in the Lisbon region. The \n\nvolcanic activity is contemporaneous with the previously mentioned uplift of the \n\nNazar\u00e9-Arr\u00e1bida block of the Lusitanian basin and sits on top of a paleokarst formed by \n\nthe erosional unconformity carved on Cenomanian limestones. The subaerial volcanism \n\nis divided in at least six effusive and explosive events that originated a sequence of \n\nflows and pyroclastic ash deposits at least 400 m thick (Serralheiro, 1978; Ramalho et \n\nal., 2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.14: Geological map of the Lisbon region showing all the main magmatic occurrences. Adapted \n\nfrom the 1:500 000 geological map of Portugal (Oliveira et al., 1992). \n\n \n\nThe enrichment in incompatible elements  and low 87Sr/86Sr72 (approximately \n\n0.70325, Pal\u00e1cios, 1985) of the basic magmas suggest they were generated by a low \n\nvolume partial melting of an incompatible element enriched mantle source, \n\ncharacterized by a time integrated Sr depletion and the presence of residual garnet and \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n \n\nK-rich mineral, similarly what was described for the intrusive igneous complexes. The \n\nisotopic Sr (87Sr/86Sr72 = 0.70325-0.70812) and O (?18O = 6.22-11.19) signatures of the \n\nentire suite point towards the evolution from the more basic to the more acid members \n\ntaking place by the joint action of low pressure fractional crystallization of a basic \n\nalkaline magma along with the assimilation of crustal materials (Pal\u00e1cios, 1985). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.1.5 The Mafra radial dyke complex, Oeiras-Cascais dykes, Pa\u00e7o d'Ilhas and Foz da \n\nFonte sills and other minor occurrences in the Lusitanian basin \n\nSeveral other smal alkaline intrusions of Late Cretaceous age can be found in the \n\nLusitanian basin. They are not integrated in the LVC because some of them appear to be \n\nassociated with a different stress field (Mafra radial dyke swarm, Oeiras-Cascais dykes), \n\nhave older ages (Pa\u00e7o d'Ilhas sill) or are located relatively far from the LVC (the Foz da \n\nFonte sill and the intrusions associated with the Sesimbra salt diapir). \n\nAmong them, one of the most discussed is the Mafra radial dyke complex (fig. \n\n2.14). It is constituted by a series of dykes that radiate from a central gabbroic plug \n\nlocated in the vicinities of Mafra. These dykes are substantially altered alkaline basic \n\nrocks and are best observed in the coastal area around Ericeira. Their outcropping \n\npattern suggests intrusion with a stress field characterized by radial ?1 (where: ?3 \u2013 \n\nmaximum compression; ?2 intermediate compression; ?1 \u2013 minimum compression) \n\ncontrolled by a deep intrusion. They were recently subject of an integrated Anisotropy \n\nof Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) and analysis of preferred mineral and vesicle \n\norientation study that points towards the magmatic flow coming from the direction of \n\nthe central plug and at an angle that suggests the presence of a larger magma chamber at \n\na depth of approximately 3.2 km (Nogueira et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nThe Pa\u00e7o d'Ilhas sill (fig. 2.14), also known as the Ribamar gabbro (Zbyszewski \n\net al., 1955), was previously included in the LVC due to its similar chemical and \n\npetrographic characteristics (Pal\u00e1cios, 1985), but subsequent age determinations showed \n\nthat it is actually between 88 and 86 My old (K-Ar ages in biotite and K-feldspar \n\nseparates, respectively, Mahmoudi, 1991) and therefore significantly older than the \n\nLVC. The sill intrudes Lower Cretaceous sediments (Albian and Aptian-Barremian \n\nsandstones and limestones), having an outcropping area of around 6 km2. It is a layered \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n \n\nintrusion made up of monzonitic and syenitic sheets in a monzograbbroic body \n\n(Mahmoudi, 1991). These correspond to segregations produced by fractional \n\ncrystallization processes with the lighter plagioclases accumulating on top of the sill by \n\nflotation and the heavier mafic minerals sinking to the bottom (Mahmoudi, 1991). \n\n \n\nThe 8 m thick Foz da Fonte sill (fig. 2.8) is located in the Set\u00fabal Peninsula, on \n\nthe cliffs just South of the beach with the same name and corresponds to the \n\nsouthernmost intrusion in the Lusitanian basin. It outcrops for around 150m along the \n\ncoast, and it terminates against the Aptian sediments it intrudes in the north, while in its \n\nsouthern limit it is cut by an NNW-SSE trending dextral strike-slip fault (Kullberg, \n\n2000). It has recently been the target of an AMS study that proposed that the magmatic \n\nconduit for this sill has a NNE-SSW direction and could be possibly related to a \n\nreactivated Variscan fault or to a secondary fracture related with the NNW-SSE Sintra-\n\nSines-Monchique deep fault (Miranda et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nThe Oeiras-Cascais dykes (fig. 2.14) outcrop in the coastal area between the \n\nCarcavelos beach and Cabo Raso. They display orientations between NNE-SSW and \n\nNNW-SSE and are constituted by alkaline basalts, lamprophyres and hawaiites \n\n(Miranda et al., 2005). They are thought to have intruded pre-existing fractures formed \n\nby a stress field characterized by N-S ?3, vertical ?2 and approximately E-W ?1, with \n\n?2 and ?3 inverting during the installation of the dykes (Costa, 1980). A more recent \n\nwork on the westernmost dykes concluded that these were emplaced in  previously \n\nexisting cleavage fractures contemporaneously with an important left strike slip \n\nmovement along these same fractures within a stress field characterized by an E-W to \n\nNW-SE ?3 (Maia and Gon\u00e7alves, 2006).  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2.3.1.6 Minor occurrences in the Algarve basin \n\nThe Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism is also represented in the Algarve \n\nbasin by a series of dykes, plugs, sills and necks of basanitic to lamprophyric nature \n\n(Martins, 1991). They outcrop mostly in the coastal region and are also associated with \n\nsalt diapirs. Their emplacement is contemporaneous with the above mentioned \n\nMonchique igneous complex (72 to 75 Ma, Martins, 1991; 61.5-70.4 Ma, Storetvedt et \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n \n\nal., 1990) with which they also share geochemical affinities, pointing to a similar \n\nsublithospheric mantle source (e.g.87Sr/86Sr75 = 0.70276-0.70385, enrichment in \n\nincompatible elements and light REE, Martins 1991). Their mineralogy, namely the \n\nexistence of green core clinopyroxenes and amphiboles with partly resorpted cores, \n\npoints towards an important contribution of magma mixing in the generation of the \n\nobserved lithotypes, with the basanites representing a complete mix between a more \n\nevolved and a more basic magma and the lamprophyres corresponding to only partial \n\nmixing of these liquids due to smaller residence times in the magma chamber and faster \n\nextraction (Martins, 1999). \n\n \n\n2.3.2 The offshore West Iberian Margin \n\n \n\n The significant advances made recently in the Marine Geosciences domain have \n\nallowed researchers to identify, sample and study a series of previously unknown \n\nigneous alkaline seamounts in the WIM. The purpose of this section is to describe these \n\noccurrences and, when possible, discuss the mechanisms responsible for their \n\ngeneration.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2.1 The Madeira-Tore Rise \n\n The Madeira-Tore rise groups a series of mid ocean ridge parallel seamounts \n\nbetween the Tore seamount and its several peaks, and the Madeira archipelago (fig. \n\n2.15). It encompasses the Josephine and Lion seamounts, among many others whose \n\nname changes depending on author and publication. It is cut in across by the Azores-\n\nGibraltar fracture zone, dividing it in a northern branch that includes all the seamounts \n\nbetween Tore and Josephine and a southern branch that groups the remaining seamounts \n\nfrom Josephine to Madeira. The rise has a total estimated volume of erupted magma of \n\n105 km3 (Merle et al., 2009) \n\nThe rise is located on transitional to oceanic crust and extruded onto seafloor \n\nwith an age corresponding to the J magnetic anomaly (? 124-118 Ma) and is paired with \n\nthe J Anomaly ridge across the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR), on the American plate \n\n(Peirce and Barton, 1991). \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n \n\n \nFig. 2.15: Map of the alkaline igneous occurrences in the West Iberian Margin. Ages from \n\nGeldmacher et al., 2006, and Merle et al., 2006, 2009. \n\n \n\n Its origin was initially attributed to the Madeira hotspot, with the seamounts \n\nrepresenting its hotspot trail (Morgan, 1982; Crough, 1983; Ferreira et al., 1988), but \n\nthe existence of the conjugate J Anomaly ridge led Peirce and Barton (1991) to propose \n\nthat they had been generated during a period of intense volcanism in the MAR which \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n \n\nproduced a thicker, isostatically balanced oceanic crust. However, the most recent \n\nstudies revealed that some of the seamounts that constitute the Madeira-Tore rise have \n\nages more recent than the magnetic J anomaly, which argues for a different generation \n\nmechanism (Merle et al., 2006, 2009; Geldmacher et al., 2006). \n\n  Merle et al. (2006) analyzed several intermediate igneous alkaline rocks from \n\nthe northern branch of the rise, which they also dated using the U-Pb method in zircon \n\nand titanite separates. The ages obtained show a range from 80 to 104 Ma and show no \n\nspatial age progression. The isotopic signatures shown by these rocks (206Pb/204Pb \n\n19.139 - 19.620, 207Pb/204Pb 15.544 - 15.828, 208Pb/204Pb 38.750 - 39.936, 87Sr/86Sri \n\n0.70231 - 0.70340, and ?Hfi 6.9 a 12) are distinct from the ones shown by normal Mid \n\nOcean Ridge Basalts (MORBs) and the rocks associated with the Madeira and Azores \n\nhotspots. They were interpreted by the authors as being derived from the interaction \n\nbetween a long lived thermal anomaly with an OIB-like (Ocean Island Basalt) \n\ncomposition associated with some  crustal recycling, probably through delamination or \n\ninteraction with the Iberian lithospheric mantle and crust (Merle et al., 2006). \n\n The southern branch of the Madeira-Tore rise was dated through the Ar-Ar and \n\nbiostratigraphic methods and yielded ages that can be divided into two groups \n\n(Geldmacher et al., 2006). The first phase of magmatism took place during the Late \n\nCretaceous, between 80 and 95 Ma, and is detected in the base of the larger seamounts \n\nand around to the Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone, while the second phase is of Neogene \n\nage (16 \u2013 0.5 Ma) and was identified on the top of some seamounts, especially the ones \n\ncloser to the Azores-Gibraltar fracture in the elevations just north to the Madeira \n\nArchipelago (Geldmacher et al., 2006). The Late Cretaceous rocks are trace element \n\nenriched and their isotopic composition is compatible (206Pb/204Pbi 19.44 \u2013 19.55, \n207Pb/204Pbi 15.58\u201315.59, 208Pb/204Pbi 38.73 \u2013 39.15, 87Sr/86Sri 0.702797 \u2013 0.702883, \n143Nd/144Ndi   0.512878 \u2013 0.512885 176Hf/177Hfi  0.282976)  with a derivation from the \n\nCanary mantle plume, while the Neogene show a wider range of isotopic compositions \n\n(206Pb/204Pbi 18.792\u2013 20.245, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.485\u201315.619, 208Pb/204Pbi 38.334\u2013 39.968, \n87Sr/86Sr 0.702800 \u2013 0.703238, 143Nd/144Ndi   0.512842\u2013 0.513090 176Hf/177Hfi  \n\n0.283004 - 0.283163) that overlap both the Madeira and Canary domains with the \n\nnorthern occurrences being more isotopically enriched than the southern ones \n\n(Geldmacher et al., 2006). The authors explain these differences in composition and age \n\nwith a model considering that the first phase generated by the interaction of the Canary \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n \n\nhotspot with the MAR whereas the second pulse is a mix of activity derived from the \n\nMadeira hotspot in the southernmost part of the ridge and from the melting of \n\nlithospheric mantle on extensional basins in the vicinities of the Azores-Gibraltar \n\nfracture zone. That lithospheric mantle either contained pyroxentic material or had been \n\npreviously metasomatized and overprinted by the Canary plume in the Cretaceous \n\n(Geldmacher et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.16: Evolution of the Madeira-Tore rise according to Geldmacher et al., 2006.  \n\n \n\n Further geochronological work by Merle et al. (2009) led these authors to \n\nrecognize a total of three pulses between 103 Ma and the present. The first and oldest \n\ntaking place between 103 and 80.5 Ma in the northern and central part of the Rise, the \n\nsecond c. 68 Ma and finally a third one between 28 Ma and the present day.  \n\n However, if one considers the onshore magmatic activity and includes the \n\nOrmonde, Amp\u00e9re and Coral patch seamounts, six distinct stages are identified during \n\nthese pulses, with some of them defining linear trends (Merle et al., 2009).  \n\nAccording to Merle et al. (2009) the first stage occurred during the first pulse and \n\ndefined the lineament between the Sponge Bob and Jo Sister seamounts between 108 \n\nand 88 Ma (fig. 2.17), while the Iberian plate was moving in a NE direction. The second \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n \n\nstage also occurred during the first pulse, but has a different distribution, occurring \n\nrandomly in the rise but also in the continent between 88 and 81 Ma (fig. 2.17). From \n\n83 Ma onward the direction of movement of the Iberian plate changes again with the \n\nceasing of seafloor spreading in the Bay of Biscay which caused the rocks of stage 3 to \n\nbe aligned in an NNW-SSE direction while they intruded between 80 and 69 Ma due to \n\nthe new NNW movement direction of the plate (fig. 2.17).  \n\nThe fourth stage took place between 68 and 60 Ma and is again randomly distributed in \n\nthe oceanic domain. It was followed by stage 5, a period during which no magmatism \n\ntook place in the region and finally by stage 6, ongoing from 32 Ma to the present with \n\nactivity occurring from the Azores Gibraltar fault zone area down to the Madeira \n\narchipelago (fig. 2.17).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.17: Distribution of the pulses of alkaline igneous activity in the Central North Atlantic according to \n\nMerle et al., 2009.  \n\n \n\nMerle et al. (2009) attribute the stages where the magmatic activity seems to \n\nhave a random distribution (stages 2 and 4) to times of little or no movement in the \n\nIberian plate that led to heat accumulation in the mantle due to the blanketing effect of \n\nthe lithosphere and inducing magmatism in random locations. They also justified the \n\nlack of magmatism during stage 5 with the collision of Iberia and Europe and \n\nconsequent formation of the Pyrenees creating a compressive stress field in both the \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n \n\noceanic and continental lithosphere of the Iberian plate that prevented magma ascent. At \n\nlast, during stage 6 the continuing compression still prevented the emission of magma at \n\nthe surface, but the continuous thermal blanketing effect of the lithosphere led to \n\nmagma generation, with its release being only possible on the African plate or in the \n\nborder between Africa and Iberia, where lithospheric structures might have facilitated \n\nmagma ascent. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2.2 The Sintra-Tore lineament \n\n This lineament is defined by a series of magnetic anomalies (e.g. Silva et al., \n\n2000, fig. 2.18) and small seamounts present between the Sintra igneous complex and \n\nthe Tore seamount.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.18: Magnetic anomalies of the West Iberian Margin and the lineaments defined by them. Adapted \nfrom Silva et al., 2000. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n \n\nThe nature of the rocks that constitute it is still mostly unknown, except for one \n\nankaramite dredged by Mougenot (1989) near one of the magnetic anomalies and dated \n\nat 74 Ma (Ar-Ar; Feraud in Mougenot, 1989). Only one of these seamounts has been \n\nsampled and will be discussed later in this study.  \n\nMoreover, Alves et al. (2006) identify an intrusive body in the continental \n\nplatform West of Sintra based on seismic reflection data. \n\nThis lineament roughly coincides with the boundary between the Paleozoic Ossa \n\nMorena Zone and South Portuguese Zone terranes and is the equivalent to Collector \n\nanomaly in the North American plate, which might correspond to the Theic ocean suture \n\n(Lefort et al., 1996; Capdevila and Mougenot, in Boilot and Winterer (eds.), 1988). \n\nBadagola (2008) showed that the morphological expression of this lineament on the \n\nEstremadura Spur corresponds to the seafloor trace of a NW-SE to WNW-ESE strike-\n\nslip fault. \n\n Roque et al. (2009) identified a series of WNW-ESE to E-W structures in the \n\nEstremadura Spur and between that feature and the Tore seamount that correspond to \n\nthrusts and backthrusts that deform sediments up to the Pliocene-Pleistocene.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2.3 The Ormonde seamount, Gorringe bank \n\n The Gorringe bank is a major morphological feature that rises from the seafloor \n\nof the Tagus Abyssal Plain at rougly -5000m to -24m at the top of Gettysburgh \n\nseamount. The Ormonde seamount corresponds to the northeastern peak of the Gorringe \n\nbank, where one can find alkaline basalts, nephelinites, nepheline syenites, phonolites \n\nand monchiquites outcropping in the seabottom (Cornen, 1982). These rocks intrude or \n\ncover Cretaceous peridotites, and tholeiitic gabbros and basalts that are thought to \n\nrepresent a section of oceanic lithosphere thrusted onto the Tagus Abyssal Plain along \n\nthe Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone in mid Miocene times (Auzende et al., 1978; F\u00e9raud \n\net al., 1986, fig. 2.19). The ages obtained for these rocks vary between 67-65 Ma (Ar-\n\nAr, in whole rock, phlogopite and secondary hornblende F\u00e9raud et al., 1982, 1986) and \n\n77 Ma (U-Pb in zircon separate, Sch\u00e4rer et al., 2000). This age variation with method \n\nsuggests that the more recent ages obtained with the Ar-Ar method might represent later \n\ndeformation phases that reset the Ar system or indicate very slow cooling (Sch\u00e4rer et \n\nal., 2000), although Merle et al. (2009) suggested that the sample dated by Sch\u00e4rer et al. \n\n(2000) might be a dropstone that originally came from the Sines igneous complex.  \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.19: Diagram showing the Gorringe bank, its structure and the position of tholeiitic lithosphere and \nposterior alkaline magmatism. From Schar\u00ebr et al., 2000. \n\n \n\n Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997) studied the geochemical and isotopic composition \n\nof the alkaline rocks of the Ormonde seamount and concluded that these bear many \n\nsimilarities with the ones found in the Monchique igneous complex (87Sr/86Sri 0.70304 \u2013 \n\n0.70482, ?Ndi   6.0-6.9, 206Pb/204Pbi 19.07\u2013 19.81, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.57\u201315.77, 208Pb/204Pbi \n\n38.8\u2013 39.5 for whole rock and 87Sr/86Sri 0.70303 \u2013 0.70306, ?Ndi   0.3-6.7 for \n\nclinopyroxene separates) although the ?Ndi values for Ormonde are either higher \n\n(whole rock) or much lower (clinopyroxene separates) than the ones seen in Monchique. \n\nThe lower ?Ndi values were interpreted by these authors as reflecting the presence of a \n\nmantle lithosphere component in the Ormonde rocks similar to the one observed in \n\nMonchique, while the higher ones are associated with the dominating asthenospheric \n\ncomponent. \n\n Along with the Monchique complex, this seamount has been included in the \n\nhotspot track for the Madeira plume (fig. 2.16, Geldmacher and Hoernle, 2000; \n\nGeldmacher et al., 2000; Geldmacher et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n \n\n3. Continental intraplate alkaline anorogenic magmatism \nand its geodynamic implications \n \n Although it is not the most important type of magmatism in terms of total \n\nerupted volume, alkaline anorogenic magmatism can act as a marker for important \n\ngeodynamic processes, such as rifting, the presence of mantle plumes and their \n\ninteraction with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, and the influence of major \n\nstructure on controlling the emplacement and location of these magmatic features, while \n\nalso providing a good proxy record for the chemical and physical evolution of the deep \n\ncontinental lithosphere and underlying mantle.  \n\nBasic magmas can be generated by adiabatic decompression, volatile addition \n\nthat results in the lowering of the protolite\u2019s solidus, and by the supply of extra heat by \n\na thermal perturbation of the geotherm (e.g. Wilson, 1989). In an intraplate setting, \n\ndecompression is usually associated with extension and rifting, fluid addition to a \n\nmetasomatic event that may or may not be related to a mantle plume, which can also \n\nadd the heat necessary to for partial melting to take place. \n\nThe mantle plume definition used from here onwards is identical to the one of \n\nMorgan (1971, 1983) that defines a plume as a location where anomalously hot material \n\nthat rises from a major mantle discontinuity (e.g. the D\u2019\u2019 discontinuity that separates the \n\nmantle from the outer core or the 670 km discontinuity that separates upper from lower \n\nmantle) and ascends until it meets the lithosphere where it will start promoting the \n\ngeneration of large amounts of melts due to the addition of heat and decompression \n\nmelting. \n\nPotential sources for these basic liquids are usually ultramafic rocks (peridotites) \n\nin the upper mantle, which are mostly found in the rigid, conductive Continental \n\nLithospheric Mantle (CLM) or in the underlying asthenosphere, a plastic, convective \n\nportion of the upper mantle. The CLM, however, is divided in two distinct layers: the \n\nMechanical Boundary Layer (MBL) where heat transfers by conduction and \n\ndeformation occurs in a fragile regime and the Thermal Boundary Layer (TBL) where \n\nheat is transferred both by convection and advection and that may suffer periodical \n\nrecycling into the asthenosphere (e.g. Wilson, 1993, fig. 2.20). \n\nBesides the initial composition of both the lithosphere and asthenosphere, \n\nseveral other factors control the composition of the generated liquids, such as the extent \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n \n\nof partial melting, the potential temperature of the mantle (the temperature of a mantle \n\nrock if brought to the surface adiabatically), the thickness of the lithosphere, the amount \n\nof tectonic extension, the initial thickness of the Thermal Boundary Layer (TBL), the \n\nnature and efficiency of the magmatic extraction processes and the degree of interaction \n\nbetween the melts, the mantle lithosphere and the crust (Wilson, 1993). \n\nThe liquids generated in these conditions in intraplate environments are divided \n\ninto two major series, the alkalic and the tholeiitic. Alkaline intraplate continental \n\nbasalts usually have lower silica and higher alkali (sodium and potassium) contents than \n\ntholeiitic basalts, which also show a characteristic pattern of initial iron enrichment \n\nduring differentiation. Alkaline magmas are thought to result either from smaller partial \n\nmelt fractions of the same source that also generates the tholeiitic liquids (e.g. Hirose \n\nand Kushiro, 1993) or from melting of mantle that contains metasomatically introduced, \n\npotassium rich, hydrous minerals such as phlogopite and amphibole (e.g. Foley, 1992). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.20: Schematic representation of the location of the Mechanical Boundary Layer and Thermal \nBoundary Layer in the mantle and their relation with the advective and convective heat transfer regimes \n.Tp is the mantle\u2019s potential temperature. From Wilson, 1993. \n  \n\nIn the following sections the mechanisms for the generation and installation for \n\nthe alkaline magmatism will be presented and discussed. \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n \n\n3.1 Possible sources for alkaline anorogenic magmatism \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.21: Mathematical model of Brandenburg and van Keken (2007) illustrating mantle dymanics. \n\nUpon subduction (B), the lithosphere is recycled to the lower mantle (C) and returned to the mantle (D), \n\nand can be brought up at mid-oceanic ridges or through plumes (E) at ocean island hotspots.  \n\n \n\nBasic magmas can be generated in either the lithospheric or the sublithospheric \n\nmantle (asthenosphere). This section aims to discuss these two as possible sources for \n\nanorogenic continental alkaline magmatism. \n\n \n\n3.1.1 The Continental Lithospheric Mantle  \n\n \n\n The Continental Lithospheric Mantle has long been proposed as a possible \n\nsource for the magmas generated during rifting or the eruption of Large Igneous \n\nProvinces (LIPs). It represents a geochemical reservoir that can remain isolated from the \n\nconvective mantle during long periods of time, allowing it to develop considerable \n\nchemical and isotopic heterogeneities, and whose later melting would lead to the \n\nformation of magmas with enriched trace element and isotopic compositions \n\n(McDonough, 1990). \n\n According to Hawkesworth et al., (1990) the CLM\u2019s ability to generate basaltic \n\nmelts depends on its age, which also controls its thickness, composition and density. For \n\ninstance, an Archaic CLM would be too thick and depleted in FeO due to the extraction \n\nof komatiites and therefore have low density and fertility. On the other hand, post \n\nArchaic CLM should be produced by the incorporation of asthenospheric material by \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n \n\nconductive cooling after rifting or intraplate magmatism. In comparison, this \n\nasthenosphere has not been so strongly depleted, since komatiite formation is mostly \n\nlimited to the Archean, and is consequently richer in FeO, and as a result more dense \n\nand fertile and has also been enriched by the later percolation and crystallization of \n\nmagmatic liquids rich in incompatible elements (McDonough, 1990).  \n\nThe liquids responsible for these alterations can be hydrous, carbonated or even \n\nsiliceous melts enriched in incompatible elements that result from very small partial \n\nmelt fractions of the asthenosphere (e.g. Yaxley et al., 1998; Niu and O\u2019Hara, 2003; \n\nPilet et al., 2008; Humphreys and Niu, 2009) and/or mantle plumes, generated by \n\nadiabatic decompression or simply by the heat addition of the plume. \n\n The circulation of these silicate or carbonated melts and hydrous fluids produces \n\nmantle metasomatism, which divides itself in two main types, modal metasomatism, i.e. \n\nmodifications to the original mineralogy of the mantle rocks, often introducing hydrated \n\nphases, and cryptic metasomatism which only affects the chemical composition and \n\nisotopic signatures of the same rocks (e.g. Bodinier and Godard, 2003 and references \n\nwithin). \n\nPilet et al. (2008) put forward a model where metasomatic events would create \n\nmetasomatic amphibole rich veins, with nephelinite-like compositions. When these \n\nnephelinitic veins melt, the resulting liquids interact with the host peridotite and \n\ngenerate the compositional spectrum of silica undersaturated alkaline rocks from the \n\ninitial nephelinite through basanite and up to alkali basalt, depending on the degree of \n\ninteraction (low or non existent for nephelinites and higher for alkali basalts). These \n\nauthors did not provide contrains on the nature of the metasomatic agent. However, Niu \n\n(2008) suggested that these might be low degree partial melts from the low velocity \n\nzone in the asthenosphere.  \n\nVolatile addition through metasomatic processes can, at a given pressure (or \n\ndepth) significantly lower the solidus of the rocks it affects (e.g. Falloon and Green, \n\n1990 in Wilson, 1993). This favors the formation of magmas in regions where the \n\nmantle potential temperature is elevated by the proximity of a mantle plume and even in \n\nregions with low extension rates (Wilson, 1993) \n\nThese metasomatic events can occur in different time scales, creating \n\nheterogeneous enrichments in the mantle and producing reservoirs with diversified \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n \n\nisotopic and chemical signatures. For example, metasomatic events have been detected \n\nbetween two different eruptive phases in the Cantal massif in France (Pilet et al., 2002), \n\nwhile the episode that enriched the CLM whose fusion generated the Cretaceous \n\nlamprophyres in Moravia is attributed to an event occurred during the Variscan orogeny \n\nin the late Paleozoic (Dostal and Owens, 1998). \n\nSuch episodes would render the CLM a possible source for the basalts associated \n\nwith LIPs and other continental basaltic magmatism with low ?Nd, variable 87Sr/86Sr \n\nand low 206Pb/204Pb, with the combination of slightly high 87Sr/86Sr with low 206Pb/204Pb \n\nacting as tracers for a continental lithospheric component (Hawkesworth et al., 1990). \n\nMcDonough (1990), however, implies that this fertilization could not generate the large \n\nvolume of magmas seen on LIPs, neither the Nb and Eu anomalies that characterize \n\nthem and are not detected on mantle lithosphere xenoliths. Nevertheless, this author \n\ndoes not exclude that the CLM might be an important contributor in the generation of \n\nincompatible element enriched alkaline basalts. \n\n A \u201cpure\u201d CML component would be sampled by undersaturated basic to \n\nultrabasic magmas such as lamprophyres or lamproites and would have low ?Nd, \n\nmoderate 87Sr/86Sr, mantle ?O18, low 206Pb/204Pb and both high 207Pb/204Pb and \n208Pb/204Pb as weel as characteristically unradiogenic 187Os/188Os (Pearson et al., 2004). \n\nThis isotopic signature would reflect the CLM\u2019s different evolution due to isolation \n\nfrom the convecting mantle, which allowed for a time integrated increase of Rb/Sr, \n\nNd/Sm, Pb/Th and decrease of U/Pb (Saunders et al., 1992; Daley and DePaolo, 1992). \n\n However, the signature of the lithospheric component can change with the age of \n\nthe lithosphere and nature of the metasomatic event(s) it is affected by. Gibson et al., \n\n(1995) distinguished two mafic alkaline potassic suits with different major and trace \n\nelement abundances and isotopic compositions in the Paran\u00e1 Basin, Brazil. They \n\ninterpreted the TiO2 rich, high CaO/Al2O3, 143Nd/144Nd and low La/Nb and 87Sr/86Sr \n\nmagmas as originating in older, Archaic enriched cratonic CLM, while the TiO2 poor, \n\nlow CaO/Al2O3 and 143Nd/144Nd, and high La/Nb and 87Sr/86Sr should have been \n\ngenerated by partial melting of CLM under Proterozoic mobile belts that are more \n\nrefractory and less enriched. \n\n During lithospheric thinning resulting from continental rifting it is expectable to \n\ncome across products derived from the partial melting of metasomatized CLM but also \n\nfrom the ascending asthenosphere (e.g. Hawkesworth and Gallagher, 1993; Wilson, \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n \n\n1993). Hawkesworth and Gallagher (1993) state that the metasomatized CLM has a \n\nlower solidus and is the first to initiate melting in an extensional setting but with the \n\ncontinuation of rifting, the asthenosphere will also start melting and its contribution to \n\nthe total melt generated should increase, quickly becoming dominant and masking or \n\noverwriting the geochemical imprint of the mantle lithosphere contribution, giving rise \n\nfirst to mixed trace element and isotopic signatures and afterwards to magmas that will \n\nshow completely asthenospheric values (Wilson and Downes, 1992). \n\n In addition to being a possible source for alkaline magma generation, the CLM \n\ncan also control magma location and composition. \n\n Watson and MacKenzie (1991) proposed that magma generation from anhydrous \n\nperidotites with potential temperatures above 1300\u00baC (as in a mantle plume) is \n\nimpossible in lithospheres with an MBL thicker than 125 km. This would limit the \n\nlocalities where continental anorogenic magmatism could take place, as well as the \n\nvolume of magma produced at a fixed temperature and uphold lithospheric thickness as \n\na major control on the location of any kind of magmatism. \n\n Also, for a given temperature and pressure (and depth), the generated melts will \n\nbe richer in MgO in situations where the amount of partial melting is higher. For a fixed \n\npartial melt fraction, the MgO content increased with depth and pressure. According to \n\nthat, alkaline mafic and ultramafic magmas are usually the product of small partial melt \n\nfractions at high depths, while tholeiitic magmas are produced by higher amounts of \n\npartial fusion of a shallower mantle source (Wilson, 1993). \n\n Furthermore, Ellam (1992) suggested that the depth of the base of the \n\nlithosphere can be deduced from its chemical composition, since it will influence the \n\nREE abundances of the magmas given that it will control the mineralogy of the \n\nasthenospheric and lithospheric mantle rocks and consequentially the composition of \n\nthe magmas generated in either of these layers. Stable phases in peridotite change with \n\ndepth, with spinel occurring from 20-30 km to 60 km depth, from that depth onwards \n\ngarnet is stable and completely replaces spinel below 80 km (Ellam, 1992).  \n\nThis results in different magma compositions of melts due to equilibration of the melts \n\nwith different mantle parageneses and especially very different abundances in REE for \n\nmagmas generated in the presence or absence of residual garnet since this mineral has \n\nvery different partition coefficients (D), which are functions of the physical conditions \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n \n\nduring melting and of the melt composition (D = mineral/melt partition coefficient = \n\n(concentration of element, i, in mineral)/ (concentration of i in coexisting melt)) for the \n\nlight and heavy REE, with the first concentrating on the melt phase in case of partial \n\nmelting and the one remaining on the residual garnets if the melt fraction is small \n\nenough not to completely consume them. Consequently, using a proxy for the light \n\nREE/ heavy REE ratio (such as Ce/Yb, Ce/Y or La/Yb) we can estimate the thickness of \n\nthe lithosphere during magma generation and study its variation in prolonged eruption \n\nsequences (Ellam, 1992; Kerr, 1994). \n\n   \n\n \nFig. 2.22: Illustration of the differences in chemistry observed in areas where magma generation took \nplace under  lithospheres with different thicknesses. Also depicted are the possible metasomatic veins that \nmight be responsible for the generation of mafic alkali magmas, according to Pilet et al. (2008). Adapted \nfrom Humphreys and Niu, 2009. \n\n \nConsequentially, for a 125 km thick lithosphere it is estimated that extension with a \n\nstretching factor ? (? = l1/l0) lower than 1.5, would originate magmas by adiabatic \n\ndecompression of the asthenosphere, representing a small partial melt fraction of deep \n\ngarnet peridotites. These melts will be enriched in light REE in relation to heavy REE \n\n(high Ce/Yb), while magmas generated during and extensive phase with a higher \n\nstretching factor (? > 2) would result from higher amounts of fusion of a shallower, \n\ngarnet free peridotite (originally garnet free or where the small amounts of this mineral \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n \n\nare exhausted during melting) and necessarily have lower Ce/Yb values as spinel \n\nperidotites do not fraction REE (Ellam, 1992).  \n\nThis lithospheric lid effect has recently been found to also influence the major element \n\ncomposition of OIBs (Humphreys and Niu, 2009) with Si and Al decreasing, whereas \n\nTi, Fe, Mg and P increase with increasing lithospheric thickness and consequentially \n\nincreasing pressures and decreasing extents of melting (fig. 2.22). \n\n  \n\n3.1.2 The Sub-Lithospheric Mantle  \n\n \n\n The Sub-Lithospheric Mantle is the source of the majority of the basic \n\nmagmatism observed in the Earth\u2019s crust. It encompasses two main reservoirs, the \n\ngeochemically depleted asthenosphere and the enriched mantle plumes. \n\nThe asthenosphere has been previously depleted by melt extraction (2-3% \n\nWorkman and Hart, 2005) to form the oceanic crust, and its melts have unradiogenic \n\nisotopic compositions and are depleted in incompatible elements. Asthenospheric melts \n\nare widely represented in Mid Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORBs). Present day melts \n\ngenerated by this reservoir and that have not significantly interacted with the lithosphere \n\nor mantle plume melts during their ascent should have isotopic and trace element \n\nsignatures similar to the ones known for MORBs that are characterized by the \n\ncomponent named Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70219 - 0.70307; \n143Nd/144Nd 0.51326 - 0.51300; 206Pb/204Pb 17.573 - 18.977; 207Pb/204Pb 15.404 - \n\n15.568; 176Hf/177Hf 0.28350 - 0.28310; Workman and Hart, 2005). \n\n  Oceanic Islands are largely constituted by basalts that have not \n\ninteracted with continental crust and are supposed to represent uncontaminated mantle \n\nmelts. Geochemical studies of these Ocean Island Basalts (OIBs) allowed the definition \n\nof several isotopically and geochemically distinct mantle end member components (e.g. \n\nZindler and Hart, 1986; Weaver, 1991; Hofmann, 2003) which indicate derivation from \n\nmantle sources with diverse differentiation histories.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n \n\n  \n\nFig. 2.23: (a) 87Sr/86Sr versus ?(Nd) for OIB. The islands or island groups selected are chosen to represent \nextreme isotopic compositions in isotope diagrams. They are the \u201ctype localities\u201d for HIMU (Cook-\nAustral Islands and St. Helena), EM-1 (Pitcairn-Gambier and Tristan), EM-2 (Society Islands, Samoa, \nMarquesas), and PREMA (Hawaiian Islands and Iceland). (b) 207Pb/204Pb versus 206Pb/204Pb for the same \nOIB as plotted in (a). Note that the 207Pb/204Pb ratios of St. Helena and Cook- Australs are similar but \nnot identical, whereas they overlap completely in the other isotope diagrams. From Hoffman, 2003. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n \n\nThe geophysical (especially tomographical) work developed in these islands \n\nallowed their pairing with thermal anomalies in the mantle, corresponding to mantle \n\nplumes  that rise from deep within the mantle (e.g. Davies, 1990; Sleep, 1990), although \n\nthis connection is still the subject of vigorous debate (e.g. King and Anderson, 1998, \n\nKing and Ritsema, 2000, www.mantleplumes.org) . \n\nThese end members can be viewed as isolated reservoirs in the mantle whose \n\nmixing among themselves and with DMM would produce the entire observed isotopic \n\nmantle array or as extremes in a continuum of isotopic compositions existing in mantle \n\nrocks (Hofmann, 2003). However one chooses to view them, these end members help to \n\nidentify specific characters of mantle differentiation found on other OIBs with less \n\nextreme isotopic compositions. \n\nIsotopic compositions of rocks from these mantle end members show \n\nsystematically more enriched in radiogenic strontium and less radiogenic in neodymium \n\nand hafnium isotopic ratios than DMM although considerable overlap can exist. In the \n\ncase of lead, the overlap is complete but they extend to more extreme values in each of \n\nthe isotopic ratios. The main characteristics, possible origins and the end member values \n\nfor the Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions of each of the components defined by \n\nZindler and Hart (1986) will be described below: \n\n \n\n HIMU (HIgh \u00b5): this component is characterized by high \u00b5 (\u00b5 = 238U/204Pbt=0) \n\nand highly radiogenic Pb isotope ratios, requiring a source with very high U/Pb and \n\nTh/Pb ratios, and relatively unradiogenic Sr, pointing towards a low Rb/Sr source \n\nsimilar to DMM. Chase (1981) and Hoffman and White (1982) suggested that this end \n\nmember evolved from ancient subducted oceanic crust depleted Sr and enriched in U by \n\nhydrothermal alteration, which also depleted it in alkalis and Pb (Chauvel et al., 1992). \n\nAnother, less popular explanation is that this end member is generated by enriching \n\noceanic lithosphere during metasomatic episodes caused by the infiltration of low \n\ndegree partial melts with high U/Pb and Th/Pb. \n\nHIMU: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70285; 143Nd/144Nd 0.51285; 206Pb/204Pb 21.80; 207Pb/204Pb 15.86; \n\n208Pb/204Pb 40.12; (Hart et al., 1992). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n \n\nEM-1 (Enriched Mantle 1) and EM-2 (Enriched Mantle 2): the enriched mantle \n\ncomponents are characterized by low 143Nd/144Nd, variable 87Sr/86Sr, high 207Pb/204Pb \n\nand 208Pb/204Pb (at a given value of 206Pb/204Pb) and, as such, derive from sources \n\nenriched in LILE (Rb) and light REE (Sm). EM-1 has less radiogenic Sr and has lower \n143Nd/144Nd than EM-2. \n\nThey are both thought to represent recycled oceanic crust with the addition of \n\nsmall amounts of subducted sediment. That sediment would be of pelagic nature in the \n\ncase of EM-1 and from a terrigenous continental source in the case of EM-2 (Weaver, \n\n1991). Other possible origins for these components are the recycling of metasomatized \n\nand melt impregnated oceanic lithosphere (Workman et al., 2004) or of upper \n\ncontinental crust (Jackson et al., 2007) for EM-2 and of delaminated subcontinental \n\nlithosphere for EM-1 (e.g. Hawkesworth et al., 1986) \n\nOn the other hand, Willbold and Stracke (2006) found no clear distinction \n\nbetween the EM-1 and EM-2 components in terms of incompatible trace element ratios, \n\ndespite the different isotopic signatures. However, each EM suite has its unique trace \n\nelement signature that must reflect differences in source composition. These authors \n\nalso support the notion that the different isotopic signature of the EM components \n\ncannot be generated by the incorporation of sediment alone, but also require the input of \n\nsome upper or lower continental crust via subduction erosion. \n\n \nEM-1: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70530; 143Nd/144Nd 0.51236; 206Pb/204Pb 17.40; 207Pb/204Pb 15.47; \n208Pb/204Pb 38.85; Hart et al., 1992). \n\nEM-2: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70780; 143Nd/144Nd 0.51258; 206Pb/204Pb 19.00; 207Pb/204Pb 15. 61; \n208Pb/204Pb 38.86; Hart et al., 1992). \n\n \n\nA possible fourth component than can go by the name of PREMA (PREvalent \n\nMAntle), FOZO (FOcal ZOne), C (Common) or PHEM (Primitive HElium Mantle) \n\nis supposed to represent material from the lower mantle that is present in all mantle \n\nplumes as a mixing component (e.g. Zindler and Hart, 1986; Hart et al., 1992; Farley et \n\nal., 1992; Hanan and Graham, 1996; Stracke et al., 2005). It has also been suggested \n\nthat the ubiquitous FOZO is simply the result of continuous subductions and aging of \n\noceanic crust during recycling through the mantle (Stracke et al., 2005). \n\nCompositionally, it is very similar to DMM but has moderately more radiogenic Sr, less \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n \n\nradiogenic Nd and Hf and significantly more radiogenic Pb (Hofmann, 2003 and \n\nreferences therein).  \n\nThe origin of many of these mantle components by recycling of oceanic \n\nlithosphere has been recently backed up by seismic tomography data that shows \n\nsubducting slabs penetrating deep into the Earth down to circa 2900 km, near the core-\n\nmantle boundary (e.g. Burke and Torsvik, 2004 and references therein), where many of \n\nthese plumes are thought to originate.  \n\nAn alternative for the requirement of different mantle end members formed by \n\nrecycling of lithospheric slabs of different nature is to assume that the melts result from \n\ndifferent degrees of partial melting from peridotite and eclogites derived from \n\nheterogeneous, recycled lithosphere with different ages and composition that form a \n\nmarble cake like mantle (e.g. Armienti and Gasperini, 2007). This would also provide \n\nan explanation for the observed small scale variability of isotopic signatures observed, \n\nfor instance, in only one island.  \n\n  Hirschmann et al. (2003) suggest that alkali trace element enriched melts with \n\nstrong recycling signatures can be produced simply from melting of mantle pyroxenites \n\nat high pressure, although this conclusion was later challenged by Keshav et al. (2004) \n\nand is still the object of lively debate with other authors (e.g, see Lustrino, 2005 and \n\nreferences therein) defending the importance of the role of pyroxenites on the genesis of \n\nOIB. \n\n \n\n3.2 Anorogenic Intraplate Continental Alkaline magmatism and global \n\ntectonic processes \n\n \n\nAnorogenic Intraplate alkaline magmatism can be related to several types of \n\ngeodynamic contexts: continental rifting, the action of mantle plumes, lithospheric \n\ndelamination, edge driven convection and movement across lithospheric strike-slip \n\nfaults. \n\n In this section the magma generation and ascent mechanisms for each of these \n\ngeodynamic settings will be discussed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n \n\n3.2.1 Continental Rifting \n\n \n\nDuring tectonic extension of a continental lithosphere with normal thickness, \n\nmagmatism can be inhibited for several reasons, the most relevant probably being the \n\nduration of the extensive pulses (Keen et al., 1994, Ziegler et al., 2004). If the \n\nseparating continental blocks do not have their motion constrained laterally, rifting will \n\nbe quick and extension more localized and will not result in the eruption of a significant \n\nmagma volume since the generated melts will concentrate on the rift axis and be rapidly \n\nconsumed when oceanization and oceanic crust generations begins (Harry and Bowling, \n\n1999; Ziegler et al., 2004, fig. 2.24).  \n\nAlternatively, White (1992) argues that low extension rates allow for conductive \n\ncooling of the ascending asthenospheric mantle, which stops it from melting by \n\nadiabatical decompression. \n\nAlso, as discussed above, the thickness of the lithosphere will control the \n\namount of partial fusion for a mantle at a certain potential temperature, with the partial \n\nmelt fraction increasing as the lithospheric thickness decreases.  \n\nTherefore, alkaline magmas should be mostly associated with the first rifting \n\nphases, before the amount of partial melting increases tholeiitic melts are generated. As \n\ndecompression of normal CML should not result in magma generation unless there is \n\naddition of fluids and/or heat, the source for these alkaline melts generated during \n\nrifting should be associated with upwelling asthenosphere or mantle plumes. Some \n\nauthors have even suggested (e.g. Asmeron et al., 1994) that changing from higher to \n\nlower thinning rates during rifting would firstly induce melting on the metasomatized \n\nlithospheric mantle due to the heat addition provided by the ascent of the asthenosphere, \n\noriginating basic alkaline melts with low ?Nd. \n\nConsequently, the eruption sequence observed during continental rifting should \n\nfirst show alkaline melts with lithospheric signatures that would become progressively \n\nmore asthenospheric and less alkaline until finally they show tholeiitic characteristics \n\n(e.g. Furman, 1995; MacDonald et al., 2001). However, Reiners (2002) refers that Os \n\nisotope data indicates that extraction of melt increased with depth, with the tholeiitic \n\nmelts coming from deeper 187Os/188Os enriched fertile sources such as pyroxenites and \n\nthe alkalic ones deriving from shallower, 187Os/188Os depleted peridotites. \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n \n\nIn the Rio Grande rift, the alkaline magmatism of the Potrillo volcanic field is \n\ncharacterized by trace element enrichment, higher 87Sr/86Sr and lower 143Nd/144Nd than \n\nDMM. This event has been attributed to the fusion of lithospheric mantle \n\nmetasomatized by the infiltration of melts during a previous magmatic event that \n\npromoted the formation of metasomatic amphibole, lowered its solidus and enriched it \n\nin incompatible elements (Thompson et al., 2005). The trigger for the initiation of the \n\nmagmatism was the extension and thinning that took place in the area, coupled with the \n\nascent of a convective mantle cell. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.24: Representation of the model for magma production by Harry and Bowling. From Harry and \nBowling, 1999. \n\n \n3.2.2 Mantle plumes and their interactions with the lithosphere \n\n \n\nAlong with lithospheric thickness, the temperature of the sublithospheric mantle \n\nis also a crucial controlling factor in what concerns the location and composition of the \n\ngenerated magmas. \n\nThe hotter the asthenosphere, the greater the depth of initiation of melting and \n\nthe greater the volume of magma produced in the upwelling mantle, even in the absence \n\nof significant lithosphere thinning. Therefore high potential temperature mantle plumes \n\nare of great importance in the generation of continental magmatism. Also, even \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n \n\nrelatively small temperature anomalies can generate partial melts that can metasomatize \n\nthe overlying lithosphere or trigger melting in an already metasomatized lithospheric \n\nmantle. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.25: Schematic representation of the effects of the impact of a plume on the base of the lithosphere. \nUpper and lower diagrams impact on unthinned lithosphere and on a previously thinned lithosphere, \nrespectively. \n \n\n Another phenomenon commonly associated with mantle plumes is the uplift and \n\nthermal erosion usually associated with the impingement of a plume at the base of the \n\nlithosphere (fig. 2.25). The thermal erosion of the lithosphere, associated with the \n\nhigher potential temperatures of the plume, can greatly increase the melt production on \n\nthe impact site and is usually quoted as one of the causes for the formation of LIPs and \n\nmay even evolve towards extension and continental rifting (e.g. Morgan, 1983; Wilson, \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n \n\n1989; Saunders et al., 1992; Wilson, 1993, Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004). In other cases, \n\nthe impact of a plume head on lithosphere that is already being rifted results in an \n\nincrease of the deviatoric stresses which would intensify the ongoing rifting (Morgan, \n\n1983; Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004; fig. 2.25). \n\n Such interactions make it harder to distinguish the lithospheric from the \n\nasthenospheric and plume components with mixed signatures being the most likely \n\noutcome in many continental intraplate basic magmas. \n\n Magmas enriched in incompatible elements, with moderate 87Sr/86Sr, low \n206Pb/204Pb and ?Nd, and Th/Nb >1 are generally associated to assimilation, mixing and \n\nhybridization of asthenospheric DMM-like magmas and CLM melts, while negative \n\nanomalies in Nb, Ta, Sr and P, high 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/204Pb, La/Nb and Th/Nb are usually \n\nattributed to crustal contamination processes (Saunders et al., 1992).      \n\n The present day magmatism observed in the East and West African rifts is \n\nconsidered to result from the interaction between mantle plumes and the CLM (e.g. \n\nFurman, 1995; Furman and Graham, 1999; MacDonald et al., 2001; Spath et al., 2001). \n\nThese interactions are thought to be responsible for extensive metasomatism observed \n\nin the CLM within this region, mostly due to the action of carbonatitic and silicate \n\nmelts.  \n\n For example, these metasomatic events resulted in the formation of residual \n\namphibole, ilmenite, apatite and zircon in the CLM of the Rungwe area, between the \n\nEast and the West African rifts, that later controlled the trace element compositions of \n\nthe magmas generated by partial melting of this source (Furman, 1995). \n\n In the Kivu province of the East African rift, the differences in composition of \n\nthe observed magmas is related to changes on the thickness of the lithosphere in the area \n\nwhich in turn are controlled by lithospheric extension and thermo-mechanical erosion of \n\nthe TBL (Furman and Graham, 1999). These authors also found that the main \n\ncontributions to this magmatism come from the melting of metasomatized CML \n\n(87Sr/86Sr ? 0.7050, ?Nd ? 0 and 206Pb/204Pb ? 19) and from a plume with an HIMU like \n\ncomposition whose role is more important in regions with thinner lithosphere. \n\nMacDonald et al., (2001) studied basalts from the Kenya Rift and came to the similar \n\nconclusions, identifying plume and lithospheric mantle components in the rocks of that \n\nregion, although it has also been suggested that only the metasomatized CLM was \n\ninvolved in the genesis of these basalts, with the observed different isotopic signatures \n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n \n\ncorresponding to melts coming from areas with different degrees of metasomatic \n\nenrichment (Sp\u00e4th et al., 2001).  \n\n Fodor et al. (1998) found evidence for a lithospheric component with an EM-1 \n\nlike composition (relatively high 87Sr/86Sr, high Ba/Nb and low La/Nb) in the Cenozoic \n\nbasalts of NE Brazil that mixed with melts resulting from the fusion of the HIMU like \n\nFernando Noronha plume and surrounding asthenosphere (DMM). \n\n   \n\n \nFig. 2.26: Schematic representation of the effects of the impact of the Tristan plume on the  lithosphere of \nthe African plate in Namibia. From Le Roex and Lanyon, 1998. \n\n \nThe passage of a mantle plume under continental lithosphere can, in addition to \n\nbeing associated with contemporaneous magmatism, also be responsible for \n\nmetasomatism in the CLM that will allow it to melt if there is later extension or heat \n\naddition, originating late alkaline magmatic events. That seems to be the case in \n\nNamibia, where the late alkaline lamprophyres and carbonatites studied by Le Roex and \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n \n\nLanyon (1998) were generated by the low degree melting of CLM that had been \n\npreviously metasomatized by the passage of the Tristan plume. These rocks show \n\nisotopic signatures similar to others associated with this plume since they were \n\nmetasomatized by fluids originating in it (relatively high 87Sr/86Sr, low 143Nd/144Nd and \n\nPb isotopic ratios that project under the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line) but \n\nerupted later, when the plume\u2019s thermal anomaly was already residual (fig. 2.26).  \n\nThe same kind of explanation is used to justify the late, post-rift magmatism of \n\nthe eastern coast of Greenland (Price et al., 1997; Bernstein et al., 1998; Storey et al., \n\n2004), with the Iceland plume being responsible for the metasomatism of the CLM and \n\nthe diffuse extension that took place in the area due to the contemporaneous northern \n\npropagation of rifting (Price et al., 1997) or the decompression resulting from erosion \n\nand subsequent isostatic adjustment (Storey et al., 2004). \n\nOther authis even argue that plumes can be channeled under continents, through \n\ncorridors of thinned lithosphere and be responsible for intraplate continental magmatism \n\nas well as further lithosphere delamination on the same corridor (e.g. the Atlas Cenozoic \n\nalkaline magmatism, Duggen et al., 2009, fig. 2.27) \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.27: Representation of the model of Duggen et al. (2009) for the generation of the Atlas magmatism \nby channeling of material from the Canaries plume through thinned lithosphere. \n\n \n\nIn summary, the interactions between CLM and mantle plumes can be used to \n\nexplain the existence of alkaline magmatism in different geodynamic contexts: sin-\n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n \n\nrifting magmatism (e.g. East and West African rifts) and post-rifting magmatism (e.g. \n\nEast Greenland). The plume contribution can be limited to supplying the thermal \n\nanomaly that will trigger melting or to the metasomatism the overlying CLM (e.g. \n\nFurman, 1995; Gibson et al., 1995; Furman e Graham, 1999; Sp\u00e4th et al., 2001) or the \n\nplume head may as well actively melt and contribute more directly to the volume of the \n\nobserved magmatism (e.g. Furman and Graham, 1999; MacDonald et al., 2001). \n\nAlternatively, a plume can contribute simultaneously with both direct melting and \n\nindirect melting from lithosphere that was previously metasomatized by fluids deriving \n\nfrom it (Gibson et al., 1995; Le Roux e Lanyon, 1998; Furman e Graham, 1999; Larsen \n\net al., 2003). \n\n \n3.2.3 Delamination of the CLM \n\n \n\nMetamorphic reactions occurred during continental collision can lead to an \n\nincrease of the density of the lithospheric roots of the thickened continental area, \n\nleading to its gravitational destabilization and consequential delamination causing the \n\nlithospheric root to sink into the asthenosphere (Lustrino, 2005, fig. 2.28). \n\nThe space released by the delaminated lithospheric keel will then be filled by \n\nupwelling asthenosphere which would react with the silica rich continental crust, to \n\nform orthopyroxene rich domains with strong crustal signatures, before asthenospheric \n\naccretion takes place by conductive cooling, forming a new subcontinental lithosphere. \n\nThe delaminated keel will also start to dehydrate and melt, releasing liquids that would \n\nmetasomatize the overlying newly formed lithosphere (Lustrino, 2005, fig. 2.27). \n\nThese metasomatized crust and lithospheric mantle can remain static for several \n\nmillion years until they another geological process (e.g. extension) induces partial \n\nmelting, generating basaltic liquids with trace element and isotopic signatures similar to \n\nEM-1, with 87Sr/86Sr ? 0.706; 143Nd/144Nd ? 0.5121; 206Pb/204Pb ? 17 and 176Hf/177Hf ? \n\n0.2826 (Lustrino, 2005). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n \n\n \nFig. 2.28: Schematic representation of the model proposed by Lustrino (2005) for the generation of \nintraplate magmatism due to the delamination of a lithospheric keel. (A) to (D) continental collision and \nlithospheric thickening; (E) and (F) the high density of the lithospheric keel causes it to become unstable \nand sink into the asthenosphere, dehydrating and undergoing partial melting; (G) the space left by the keel \nwill be filled by the ascending asthenospheric mantle and metasomatized by the liquids from the sinking \nkeel, it will later cool and become lithospheric mantle; that metasomatized lithosphere can melt and origin \nto alkaline magmas if there is decompression or head addition in the region (H). \n\n \n3.2.4 Edge driven convection  \n\n \n\nSmall convective cells can form on the asthenosphere located near the edge of \n\ncratons due to horizontal temperature gradients between the cold cratonic lithosphere \n\nthat provides thermal insulation to the underlying warmer asthenosphere, and the \n\noceanic lithosphere that is warmer than the cratonic lithosphere, but is coupled with an \n\nasthenosphere that in its turn is not as warm as the one underneath the craton.  \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n \n\nThis difference induces downwelling of asthenospheric material close to the \n\ncraton\u2019s edge that is compensated by upwelling between 600 and 1000 km away from \n\nthe same edge where decompression melting would occur and give rise to magmatism \n\n(Vogt, 1991; King and Ritsema, 2000; fig. 2.29). These convective instabilities in the \n\nupper mantle can also form following lithospheric delamination (Elkins Tanton and \n\nHager, 2000). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.29: Edge driven convection forming where a mantle temperature perturbation was added to an \notherwise isothermal mantle beneath the boundary layer structure illustrated by the isotherms. The size of \nthe mantle temperature perturbation varies from about 3\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C. From King and Anderson, 1998. \n \n\nThis hypothesis was developed to explain the Bermuda swell as an alternative \n\nexplanation to generation by the action of a mantle plume (Vogt, 1991), and continued \n\nwork involving numerical modeling of edge driven convection suggests that this process \n\ncan responsible by the high magmatic productivity rates observed in LIPs located in the \n\nedge of cratons, by continuously supplying more material to the part of the mantle being \n\nsubject to partial melting (King and Anderson, 1998). This would eliminate the need for \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n \n\nthe presence of thermal anomalies and associated mantle plumes and explain the high \n\nvolume of magmas produced in certain locations (King and Anderson, 1998). \n\nMore recently, seismic tomography and numerical modeling study suggested \n\nthat several island and submarine seamount chains and even their counterparts in \n\ncontinental margins do not correspond to hotspot tracks but to the superficial expression \n\nof such small scale convective cells (King and Ritsema, 2000). \n\nEdge driven convection was also the mechanism proposed by Matton and J\u00e9brak \n\n(2009) to explain the magmatism associated with the continental Peri-Atlantic Alkaline \n\nPulse (PAAP). The PAAP includes intrusive and extrusive alkaline events in passive \n\nmargins in the North, Central and South Atlantic which these authors have attributed to \n\nmagmas generated by decompression of the asthenosphere due to edge driven \n\nconvection that later ascended through reactivated lithospheric faults (Matton and \n\nJ\u00e9brak, 2009). \n\n \n3.2.5 Reactivation of translithospheric faults \n\n \n\nBlack et al., (1985) argued that many of the alkaline provinces that appear \n\naligned, but do not show any sort of spatial age progression, are actually the result of \n\nmagma generation and ascent along translithospheric transfer faults, whose age \n\ndistribution reflects changes in relative plate motions due to plate reorganization or \n\norogenic events in their edge. \n\nIn this kind of geodynamic context, the movement along the fault increases \n\ntemperature and reduces viscosity with depth, due to the increased shear stress at the \n\nbase of the lithosphere. This would lead to decompression, metasomatism and volatile \n\naddition to the lithosphere that could ultimately lead to partial melting and the ascent of \n\nthese melts through the faults and to the surface (Black et al., 1985). \n\nThe inversion of the direction of movement along the same fault system can lead \n\nto the propagation of tensil fractures down to the asthenosphere, and repeat the process \n\nof magma formation and ascent mentioned above, creating a different phase of \n\nmagmatism (Black et al., 1985). \n\nThe Cenozoic magmatism in Hoggar, NW Africa, is justified as a consequence \n\nof the reactivation of mega shear zones, formed during the Proterozoic Pan-African \n\norogeny. This reactivation took place due to intraplate stresses caused by the collision \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n \n\nbetween the African and Eurasian plates. This process led to linear lithosphere \n\ndelamination along the shear zones and consequential ascent, decompression and partial \n\nmelting of the asthenosphere and metasomatized lithosphere (Li\u00e9geois et al., 2005). The \n\nmagmas generated during this process occur along the Pan-African shear zones, have \n\nmantle signatures corresponding to mixes between the EM-1 and HIMU components \n\nand their ages agree with the major Cenozoic collision phases between Africa and \n\nEurasia (Li\u00e9geois et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 2.30: Two representations of the hypothesis advanced by Vaughan and Scarrow to the formation of \nstrike-slip faults in regions subjected to potassic metasomatism. From Vaughan and Scarrow (2003). \n\n \n\nA similar mechanism is cited by Harmand and Cantagrel (1984) to justify the \n\nalkaline magmatism that accompanies the several deformation phases of the Atlas chain, \n\nwith the difference that the reactivated faults were generated during Mesozoic \n\ncontinental rifting. Localized decompression and melting of previously metasomatized \n\nlithosphere along translithospheric fractures is also used to explain the Cenozoic \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n \n\nalkaline magmatism and its isotopic signature (87Sr/86Sr 0.70299\u20130.70372, ?Nd 4.2\u20136.3) \n\nof the Ross Embayment area in Antarctica (Rocchi et al., 2002). \n\nVaughan and Scarrow (2003), however, propose a reverse relation between \n\nmetasomatism and faulting. They suggest that potassic mantle metasomatism by K-rich \n\nmelts resulting from small amounts of asthenospheric partial melting control the \n\nnucleation of translithospheric structures. For these authors, a local or regional \n\ntranstensive stress field will tend to use areas that were previously the target of potassic \n\nmetasomatism as nucleation points for shear zones or strike-slip structures.  This will \n\nalso trigger small amounts of extension, decompression and associated partial melting. \n\nThese melts will then infiltrate the lithosphere, concentrating deformation and \n\npromoting further nucleation and propagation of fractures along the lithosphere, until \n\nthey reach the surface, accompanied by contemporaneous potassic magmatism (fig. \n\n2.30). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n \n\n4. Sample collection \n \n\n \nFig. 4.1: General map showing all the sampled locations. \n\n \nSeveral samples representative of the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle were \n\ncollected both on the onshore and offshore West Iberian Margin. The aim of this \n\nsampling campaign was to characterize the geochemistry of the more primitive rocks, \n\n\n\n \n\n79 \n \n\ntheir source, and to provide additional constrainsts to the geochronology of the Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline cycle. Morever, it this study will allow the detection of possible \n\ngeochemical variations with age and/or location of the collected samples. \n\n \n\n Fig. 4.2: Map showing the sampled locations in the Lisbon region. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n80 \n \n\nThe samples were gathered during a time interval from 2006 to 2008 and \n\nsubsequently processed in the sample preparation laboratories of GeoFCUL to allow for \n\ndetailed petrographic, geochemical and geochronological studies.  \nThe collected samples belong primarily to the most basic lithologies in each \n\ncomplex, so that the effects of crustal contamination could be minimized and the \n\noriginal source signatures better distinguished. \n\nThe sample locations are summarized on figures 4.1 and 4.2 and listed along \n\nwith the respective geographic coordinates in annex I. \n\nThe samples from the Monchique complex collected and described by Clavijo \n\nand Valadares (2003) and Valadares (2004) were also integrated in this study resulting \n\nin the addition of further mineral chemistry and isotopic geochemistry data. \n\n \n\n4.1 Onshore sampling \n\n  \n4.1.1. The Lisbon Volcanic Complex \n\n \nSeveral of the occurrences associated with the Lisbon Volcanic Complex (LVC) \n\nwere sampled (fig. 4.2). Namely the basal and top flows of its basic lava sequence, \n\nsome of the associated necks, and also several of the basic to intermediate sills and \n\nplugs associated to the complex. \n\n \n\n- The lava flows: \n\nThe basal lava flows are exposed on the contact between the LVC lava pile and \n\nthe Cenomanian limestones. The basal unit always occurs on top of a pyroclastic \n\nsequence with variable thickness, which itself overlays a paleokarst formed on the \n\nlimestone. The pyroclastic sequence can also show some signs of previous erosion, with \n\nthe lava flows filling paleochannels on the pyroclastic layer, as can be seen in Negrais \n\n(fig. 4.3). \n\nSamples of the basal unit were collected near Lexim, (RM 7), Negrais (RM 42-\n\n45), Fanh\u00f5es (RM 69-74), Ramada (RM 79-80), Bolores (RM 59-61), and Ponte de \n\nLousa (RM 40-41), for coordinates see annex I. \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n \n\nThis unit constituted by alkaline basalts which are usually moderately to lightly \n\nporphyritic, with olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts in a dark grey matrix with few \n\nvesicles filled by secondary calcite or zeolite. Some amphibole phenocrysts are also \n\nobserved in Negrais. Alteration is more important in Bolores, Ponte de Lousa and some \n\nof the Ramada and Fanh\u00f5es samples. \n\nDue to important erosional events that took place during the Cenozoic and even \n\nin recent times, the topmost unit that was sampled is not likely to correspond to the last \n\neffusive event of the LVC. The samples from the highest position in the stratigraphic \n\nsequence of the lava pile were collected in Ramada (RM 102) and near Murteira (RM \n\n103) (fig. 4.3) and correspond to more or less altered porphyritic basalts with abbundat \n\nolivine and scarcer clinopyroxene phenocrysts. The most altered samples show \n\nchloritized or serpentinized olivines and thin calcite veins. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.3: The basal LVC flow filling a paleovalley in the LVC pyroclasts near Negrais, in the area where \n\nsamples RM 42-45 were collected.  \n\n \n\nPorphyritic basalts with clinopyroxene and olivine phenocrysts and also some \n\naphanitic basalts were recovered from outcrops in the small Runa basin, near Torres \n\nVedras (RM 34-35). However, these outcrops mostly consist of sparse boulders on \n\ncultivated areas, with little or no field relations visible between them or with the \n\nremaining lithologies present in the region. Therefore, their stratigraphic position and \n\noccurrence mode could not be accurately determined and evaluated. Also, most of the \n\nrocks are quite altered, so no further studies were made with these samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n \n\n- The necks: \n\nSeveral basaltic necks across the LVC were sampled for this study. They intrude \n\nmarls and limestones of Albian-Cenomanian age or the sandstones, limestones and \n\nmudstones of the Barremian-Aptian \u201cGr\u00e9s de Almargem\u201d unit. \n\n These necks (fig. 4.4) commonly display two different facies, the fine grained, \n\noften aphanitic marginal facies and the coarser central facies, both of which were \n\nsampled.  \n\nThe coarser interior facies can be very porphyritic, displaying milimetric \n\nclinopyroxene and olivine crystals. Samples taken from these occurrences are mostly \n\nfresh, with the only signs of alteration being some reddish altered olivines and the \n\npresence of carbonate and zeolites filling vesicles and secondary fractures. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.4: The Lexim (left) and Torre da Besueira (right) necks, showing columnar jointing. \n\n \n\nThe sampled necks were Monte Serves (RM 65-66), Torre da Besueira (RM 1-\n\n3), Montemuro (RM 57-58), Funchal (RM 93-94), Gare de Mafra (RM 92), Penedo do \n\nLexim (RM 4-6) located between Vialonga, Negrais and Malveira, and the Serra do \n\nSocorro (RM 26-28) and nearby S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o necks (RM 29-30), further to the north \n\n(fig. 4.2). \n\n \n\n- The plugs: \n\nThree small, half sphere shaped plugs outcrop in the abrasion platform of the \n\nRibeira d\u2019Ilhas beach (fig. 4.5) intruding the sandstones, limestones and mudstones the \n\nAptian-Albian \u201cBelasiano\u201d unit. They are also related to small sills that occur on the \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n \n\ncountry rock above them and to irregular shaped dykes made out of similar material \n\n(fig. 4.5). \n\nIn general, these rocks are very porphyritic and rich in centimetric xenoliths and \n\nxenocrysts that are scattered in a black groundmass. Most of the phenocrysts observed \n\nare amphibole and pyroxene, with auxiliary olivine. Both the south (RM 36) and central \n\n(RM 37) plugs were sampled. \n\nThe interior of the central and largest plug is more altered than its chilled \n\nmargin, displaying a greener color, abundant vesicles and completely altered olivines. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.5: The Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plugs. On the right you can also observe the irregularly shaped dyke \n\nassociated with the south plug outcropping in the cliff behind it. \n\n \n\n- The Oeiras-Cascais dykes: \n\nThese dykes outcrop mostly in the abrasion platform and cliffs of the beaches \n\nnear the cities of Oeiras and Cascais (fig. 4.6). \n\nMany of them intruded pre-existing fractures that cut the Lower Cretaceous \n\nsedimentary units that outcrop in that area. Their maximum thickness rarely exceeds \n\n2m.  \n\nThese fractures were reactivated after the intrusion of the dykes, during the \n\ninversion of the Lusitanian basin. This promoted intense fracturation and fluid \n\ncirculation in many of them, which caused significant alteration, namely oxidation and \n\ncarbonatization of the original magmatic rocks and filling of the fractures with \n\nsecondary carbonate material. \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n \n\nThe dykes show two preferential directions: NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE, but no \n\ncrosscut criteria were observed between them. The NNE-SSW direction seems to be \n\nmore abundant between the Parede-Estoril sector, while the NNW-SSE appears to \n\ndominate from Estoril to Cabo Raso (see fig. 4.2). \n\nThey also divide themselves compositionally between very porphyritic olivine \n\nand clinopyroxene basalts and plagioclase and amphibole phyritic hawaiites with \n\nabundant carbonate filled vesicles.  \n\nBoth these types occur in the two observed directional trends, although the \n\nbasalts seem to intrude predominantly NNE-SSW fractures. Sometimes it is also \n\npossible to observe a linear basaltic dyke surrounded by what seems to be a more \n\nirregular trending, more evolved dyke, but again, the relation between the two is \n\nunclear. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.6: Several dykes outcropping in the marine abrasion platform in the Avencas (left) and Parede \n\n(right) beaches between Cascais and Oeiras. The larger dyke on Avencas beach is of basaltic nature while \n\nthe other two are trachybasaltic. \n \n\nIn this region, several dykes were sampled between the Parede and Tamariz \n\nbeaches (RM 52-54; 62-64; 87-91), but only three of them were fresh enough to study, \n\nnamely the aphanitic basaltic dyke in the beach in front of the Parede sanatorium (RM \n\n52), the porphyritic basalt that outcrops in Bafureira beach (RM 64) and the porphyritic \n\nhawaiite with plagioclase phenocrysts just west of Praia da Po\u00e7a (RM 90). \n\n \n\n- The sills: \n\nSeveral sills with compositions ranging from basic to acidic and nepheline \n\nnormative to quartz normative have been included in the LVC by several authors (e.g. \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n \n\nPal\u00e1cios, 1985). They are mostly found closer to the Sintra igneous complex but also \n\noccur in other locations. \n\nFor this work, the more basic sills were sampled as well as some of the \n\nintermediate ones, in order to understand the processes that characterized the magmatic \n\nevolution of the complex. \n\n \n\nThe Lomba dos Pianos sill (fig. 4.2) was sampled (RM 9-10) in an abandoned \n\nquarry north of Magoito beach, that is presently being used as a landfill. The sill shows \n\na thickness of around 10m in that location and intrudes marls and limestones of Albian-\n\nCenomanian age (fig. 4.7). \n\nThe rock is melanocratic and porphyritic, with plagioclase and clinopyroxene \n\nphenocrysts in a dark matrix. The outcrop shows abundant zeolite filling in fractures \n\nand cavities.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.7: The Lomba dos Pianos sill (top) and two aspects of the An\u00e7os sill (bottom). \n\n \n\nThe Montelevar sill (fig. 4.2) intrudes marls and limestones of Albian-\n\nCenomanian age and was sampled in a construction site next to the Montelevar \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n \n\ncemetery (RM 49-50) where the sill was well exposed and relatively fresh. Neither the \n\ntop nor bottom portions of the sill were exposed in this location making it impossible to \n\nestimate its thickness. \n\nThe rock is medium grained and, viewed in hand sample, constituted mostly by \n\nplagioclase with some clinopyroxene. Alteration was important with some of the \n\nminerals looking brown due to oxidation and clay alteration. \n\n \n\nThe An\u00e7os sill intrudes (fig. 4.2) marls and limestones of Albian-Cenomanian \n\nage and was sampled in two different locations: in a quarry near Rebanque (RM 67-68, \n\nfig. 4.7) and in a road cut along the road that connects An\u00e7os and Maceira (RM 55). On \n\nthe quarry, the top of the sill dipps approximately 12\u00ba South and is approximately 20m \n\nthick. No layering or other internal structure was distinguished within the sill.  \n\nThe samples show a porphyroid texture with plagioclase and pyroxene \n\nphenocrysts in a finer grained matrix. All of the samples showed some alteration, with \n\nthe mafic minerals and some plagioclases transforming into phyllossilicates. \n\n \n\nThe Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill (fig. 4.2) is located near the previously mentioned sills \n\nand intrudes the same stratigraphic unit. It was sampled in outcrops exposed near the \n\nlocality with the same name (RM 46-47). The sill displays a very fine grained texture \n\nand abundant vesicles filled with orange to pink zeolites. Some rare centimetric \n\nxenoliths are also observed. \n\n \n\nThe Alqueid\u00e3o sill (fig. 4.2) near Sobral de Monte Agra\u00e7o was also sampled but \n\nits samples proved to be too altered to pursuit further studies. This sill intrudes Upper \n\nJurassic (Tithonian) rocks, has a medium grained texture, and is constituted mostly by \n\nplagioclase and clinopyroxene.  \n\n \n4.1.2. The Malveira da Serra sill \n\n \nThis sill is located in the southern flank of the Sintra intrusion and has been \n\nattributed to a first phase of igneous activity in the region that preceded the installation \n\nof the granite laccolith (e.g. Kullberg and Kullberg, 2000). \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n \n\nIt outcrops on a roadcut just outside Malveira da Serra, where it intrudes \n\nlimestones of Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian age. It is a very porphyritic rock with abundant \n\nclinopyroxene and amphibole phenocrysts in an aphanitic matrix (RM 25). \n\n \n\n4.1.3. The Mafra plug  \n\n \nThis gabbroic plug was sampled in a construction site near Almada (RM 83), \n\njust outside of Mafra (fig. 4.2). The rock was quite altered but some fresh boulders \n\nseparated by disaggregated alteration zones were sampled. Near this outcrop another \n\nmesocratic, porphyritic igneous rock with plagioclase and an altered mafic mineral \n\nphenocrysts occurred, but no age relation between these two was observed. \n\nThe Mafra gabbroic rock is similar to the gabbros present in Sintra, with large \n\namphibole and clinopyroxene aggregates giving it a glomoporphyric texture. However, \n\nthis rock possesses a finer matrix between the more porphyritic phases and is also less \n\naltered showing a darker grey colour. \n\nIn the vicinities of this gabbroic plug, many other igneous rocks are present in \n\nthe shapes of dykes and of what may be sills. They are altered and often more evolved, \n\nvarying from melano to mesocratic and usually porphyritic, showing plagioclase and \n\nmafic mineral phenocrysts, but the alteration makes their classification a difficult task. \n\n \n4.1.4. The Foz da Fonte sill \n\n \nThe 8m thick Foz da Fonte sill (fig. 4.2) outcrops for an extension of \n\napproximately 200 m at a N-S coastal section in the Set\u00fabal peninsula (fig. 4.8), south \n\nof Lisbon, and intrudes sedimentary sequence of Aptian age (Kullberg, 2000).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.8: The Foz da Fonte sill in a general view (left) and a detail of its upper contact (right). \n\n\n\n \n\n88 \n \n\nIt is a fine grained melanocratic rock with abundant, carbonate filled vesicles \n\ntowards its top (fig. 4.8). Its samples correspond to FF 2-4. \n\n \n4.1.5. The Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill \n\n \nThe Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill was sampled in a quarry near the locality with the same \n\nname (PI 1-11). Sections of this sill with approximately 20m thickness are exposed in \n\nthe quarry walls and the top contact between sill and Lower Cretaceous sediments \n\n(Albian and Aptian-Barremian sandstones and limestones) is also observed. The sill is a \n\nlayered intrusion and both the fine grained melanocratic monzogabbroic layers and the \n\nmesocratic monzosyenitic layers were sampled. \n\n \n4.1.6. The Sintra mafic rocks \n\n \nThe Sintra gabbros, also known as mafraites (Matos Alves, 1964), occur in \n\nseveral distinct outcrops inside the Sintra intrusive complex. Two of these were \n\nsampled, the Peninha (RM 11-17) and the Az\u00f3ia (RM 18-23) outcrops, both of which \n\nare part of the Cabo da Roca complex (see section 2.3.1.1). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.9: Details of the Sintra gabbros in the Azo\u00eda (left) and Peninha (right) outcrops. \n \n\nThe Peninha gabbros contact with syenite and igneous breccias (e.g. Ramalho et \n\nal., 2001). They were collected on a roadcut along a forest road near Peninha and show \n\nsignificant heterogeneity in terms of grain size (fig. 4.9) and preferred mineral \n\norientation. \n\nAll samples show plagioclase, amphibole and pyroxene but these may range in \n\ngrain size from medium to coarse and almost pegmatitic. Amphiboles and pyroxenes \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n \n\ncan either display a preferential orientation or form aggregates in a characteristic \n\nglomoporphyric texture. Some alteration and secondary veins are visible but overall, \n\nalteration is not very important in these rocks. \n\nThe Az\u00f3ia outcrop corresponds to a series of boulders inside a walled terrain \n\nnear the village of Az\u00f3ia. These rocks are very coarse grained, and show plagioclase, \n\namphibole and pyroxene as well as abundant green alteration minerals and light colored \n\nsecondary veins that sometimes showed epidote rich centers. The same glomoporphyric \n\ntexture that was observed in Peninha is also present here (fig. 4.9). \n\nThe diorite was sampled on a roadcut between Malveira da Serra and Biscaia, \n\nnear the entrance to Quinta da Tom\u00e9lia (RM 24). It is a medium grained rock showing \n\nplagioclase, amphibole and biotite and some greenish alteration products. \n\n \n4.1.7. The Sines mafic rocks \n\n \nThe Sines gabbros occur in two distinct outcrops within the complex, one in the \n\nNorth, near Pedras Negras and the other in the South, closer to the Sines city center.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.10: Details of the Sines gabbros at Praia Vasco da Gama (top left) and Pedras negras outcrops \n\nshowing crosscutting dykes (top right) and apparent compositional layering (bottom left and right). \n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n \n\nThe southern outcrop was sampled at Praia Vasco da Gama (RM 96-98), and \n\ncontacts with diorites in the south and with syenites in the west. These rocks are coarse \n\ngrained, with amphibole crystals that can be several centimeters long (fig. 4.10). In hand \n\nspecimen, amphibole, plagioclase, and some green alteration products can be observed. \n\nThe amphiboles can in some places show the same glomoporphyric texture observed in \n\nSintra and Mafra. \n\nThe northern Pedras Negras outcrop (RM 99-101) contacts with Jurassic \n\nlimestones to the North and syenite to the South. It appears to show some layering (fig. \n\n4.10) which is not horizontal, probably reflecting accumulation parallel to the walls of \n\nthe magma chamber. This gabbro is profusely intruded by later mafic and felsic dykes. \n\nIt is medium to coarse grained with distinguishable olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase. \n\nThe diorite contacts with the Paleozoic metassediments to the south and with the \n\ngabbros to the north. It was sampled just south of Praia Vasco da Gama and is a \n\nmedium to coarse grained rock, with a lighter color than the gabbros and constituted by \n\nabundant plagioclase and biotite and clinopyroxene. \n\n \n4.1.8. The Monchique mafic and ultramafic rocks \n\n \nThese samples were provided by Vasco Valadares. For the location and \n\ndescription of these samples, see Clavijo and Valadares (2003) and Valadares (2004) \n\nand for more information on the Monchique igneous complex, go to section 2.3.1.3. \n \n4.1.9. The Loul\u00e9 dykes \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.11: Loul\u00e9 dykes inside the salt mine appearing still with a tabular shape (left) and as a boundin \n\n(right). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n \n\nThese dykes outcrop inside the Loul\u00e9 salt diapir and were sampled with the \n\npermission of the CUF group. They are frequently very deformed, being often folded \n\nand separated into individual boudins (fig. 4.11). They were sampled inside the Loul\u00e9 \n\nsalt mine in galleries C-20 and C-12-1.  \n\nDyke C-20 is around 2m thick and showed abundant igneous and metamorphic \n\nxenoliths in its centre but none in the margin. The sampled margin was fresh and \n\nporphyritic with pyroxene and biotite phenocrysts. \n\nDyke C-12-1 is less than 1m thick and shows altered olivine phenocrysts in an \n\naphanitic groundmass. \n\n \n\n4.2 Offshore sampling \n\n \nGiven the recent identification of large volumes of Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\nmagmatism in the offshore WIM (e.g. Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006, \n\n2009), an attempt was made to complement the sampling of these occurrences. \n\n \n4.2.1 The Fontanelas seamount \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.12: Magnetic anomalies between Sintra and the Tore seamount. Figure by M\u00e1rio Moreira. \n\n \n\nOn the summer of 2008, as a part of the MAGMAFLUX research project \n\n(POCTI/CTA/48450/2002), one day of dredging took place on board the RV Professor \n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n \n\nLogachev, during the TTR-17 cruise, allowing for sampling of the Fontanelas \n\nseamount. \n\nThis seamount is located 100 km west of Ericeira (fig. 4.12, 4.13) and was \n\nselected as a sampling target among a series of magnetic anomalies occurring in the \n\nEstremadura Spur, between the Sintra igneous complex and the Tore seamount (see \n\nsection 2.3.2.2, fig. 4.12). It was chosen due to its shallower depth (top at approximately \n\n-1250m and base at around -1600m; fig. 4.13), which facilitated dredging operations on \n\nboard.  \n\nHigh resolution multibeam bathymetry and magnetic anomaly data provided by \n\nthe \u201cEstrutura de Miss\u00e3o para a Extens\u00e3o da Plataforma Continental\u201d (EMEPC) and \n\nprocessed by members of the team in the MAGMAFLUX project were crucial during \n\nthe identification of the targets and planning of the sampling campaign. Also, a dive \n\nwith the onboard TV-Grab device that preceded the dredging, allowed for the \n\nunequivocal identification of outcropping basic igneous rocks before the sampling with \n\na round dredge. \n\n \nTable 4.1: Location of the start (S) and finish (F) points for each of the dredging operations. \n\nStation number Time (GMT) Latitude Longitude Depth (m) \nTTR17AT689D S 05:27 39\u00ba05,066N 10\u00ba33,602W -1250 \nTTR17AT689D F 06:32 39\u00ba05,022N 10\u00ba33,247W -1194 \nTTR17AT690D S 07:49 39\u00ba04,740N 10\u00ba34,329W -1498 \nTTR17AT690D F 09:40 39\u00ba04,775N 10\u00ba34,114W -1340 \nTTR17AT691D S 12:35 39\u00ba05,317N 10\u00ba34,354W -1460 \nTTR17AT691D F 13:13 39\u00ba05,220N 10\u00ba34,060W -1308 \nTTR17AT692D S 14:34 39\u00ba04,810N 10\u00ba32,853W -1415 \nTTR17AT692D F 15:50 39\u00ba04,991N 10\u00ba33,112W -1230 \nTTR17AT693D S 16:48 39\u00ba04,841N 10\u00ba33,229W -1270 \nTTR17AT693D F 17:51 39\u00ba05,082N 10\u00ba33,483W -1110 \n\n \n\nA total of five successful dredge hauls were recovered along the top and flanks \n\nof the seamount (fig. 4.14, table 4.1). The contents of the dredges varied from having \n\nmore or less brown pelagic mud, biogenic material (mainly dead coral of different sizes \n\nand ages but also some sponges and numerous cirripedia plates), igneous rocks, \n\nallochthonous material (probably dropstones and rocks used as weights in fishing nets) \n\nas well as occasionally abundant phosphate and Fe-Mn nodules and crusts. \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n \n\nThe recovered pieces of igneous rocks were mostly fragments of pillow lavas \n\nthat sometimes even displayed the characteristic breadcrumb textures (fig. 4.15). They \n\nranged in size from boulders with a diameter of approximately 10 cm to one entire \n\npillow with over 40 cm diameter.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.13: Location and detailed bathymetric map of the Fontanelas seamount. High resolution \n\nbathymetric data for the Fontanelas seamount by EMEPC. Lower resolution bathymetric contours from \n\nGEBCO (www.nbi.ac.uk).  \n\n \n\nThe pillow lavas consisted of very vesicular and altered basalts with a greenish \n\nto brown color. In most cases the vesicles were filled with carbonate and clay minerals. \n\nMany of the pillow lavas were also covered with a mantle of Fe-Mn oxides of variable \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n \n\nthickness and could display corals growing on top. The high vesicle abundance is \n\nsuggestive of extensive degassing of volatile rich lava. \n\nThe lavas display a porphyritic texture, with phenocrysts of fresh pyroxene and \n\namphibole accompanying much altered olivine set in an equally altered groundmass. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.14: Detail of the Fontanelas seamount showing the location of each of the dredging operations. \n\n \n\nSome breccias made of mostly clasts of altered basalt cemented by carbonate \n\nwere also sampled.  \n\nThe dredged nodules are rounded and can either exhibit concentric layers of Fe-\n\nMn oxides or be of mainly phosphate nature, with only a thin Fe-Mn oxide cover. The \n\ncrusts that were sampled along with the nodules show similar compositions and features \n\nbut do not have a round shape, showing flat, irregular shapes. \n\nThe allochthonous material seems to have diverse origins. Some of it \n\ncorresponded to sedimentary rocks, mostly limestones but there were also high grade \n\nmetamorphic rocks with gneissic or granulitic textures and even a tholeiitic basalt. It is \n\nlikely that they may correspond to weights put in fishing nets that were lost by \n\nfisherman or correspond to dropstones, carried by icebergs to lower latitudes. \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.15: Dredge haul AT693D arriving to deck containg the largest pillow lava sampled (top left) and \n\ngeneral aspects of dredge hauls AT692D (top right), AT689D (bottom left) and AT691D (bottom right) \n\nafter washing and selection. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n \n\n5. Geochronology \n \n\nThe geochronological data presented in this section was already discussed in the \n\npaper \u201cAge constrains on the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism on the West Iberian \n\nMargin\u201d, authored by R. Miranda, V. Valadares, P. Terrinha, J. Mata, M. do Ros\u00e1rio \n\nAzevedo, M. Gaspar, J. C. Kullberg, C. Ribeiro and published in 2009 in the journal \n\n\u201cCretaceous Research\u201d (vol. 30, pp. 575-586). \n\nFurther sampling took place and during 2009, a total of 13 separates of matrix \n\nmaterial and amphibole were obtained in order to acquire further geochronological data \n\non the LVC (flows and necks), the Cascais dykes, the Sintra gabbros and diorites, the \n\nMafra radial dyke swarm, the Malveira da Serra sill and the Fontanelas seamount. \n\nUnfortunately, due to unforeseen difficulties, the data were not available in time \n\nto be integrated into this manuscript. \n\n \n\n5.1 Previous geochronological work \n\nThe Late Cretaceous alkaline igneous activity in the onshore section of the WIM \n\ntook place in a post rift setting, 30 My after the oceanic break-up in the Tagus Abyssal \n\nPlain (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Sibuet et al., 2007) and partially coincides with the \n\nPyreneean continental collision in Northern Iberia (e.g. Sibuet et al., 2004) and the onset \n\nof tectonic inversion of the Mesozoic basins (e.g. Mougenot, 1980, Terrinha, 1998, \n\nRosembaum et al., 2002), thus making the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism a key \n\nepisode in the history of this passive margin. These rocks have been object of several \n\nprevious dating attempts, summarized in table 5.1.  \n\nAs shown in table 5.1, the chronology of the main magmatic events associated \n\nwith the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle has been established on the basis of a large \n\nnumber of K-Ar ages and Rb-Sr whole rock isochrons. These two isotopic systems are \n\nextremely sensitive to post-emplacement disturbance which may explain, at least to \n\nsome extent,  the significant scatter of the published geochronological data (sometimes \n\nexceding 15 Ma for the same occurrence using one single method, table 5.1). The use of \n\nmore reliable dating techniques (e.g. incremental release 40Ar/39Ar dating and/or U-Pb \n\nzircon geochronology) is therefore fundamental to obtain precise age constraints. In \n\norder to refine the geochronology  of  the  Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle, several of the  \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n \n\n \n\nTable 5.1: Age summary for the main Late Cretaceous alkaline occurrences in the West Iberian Margin. \n\n1 \u2013 Ferreira and Macedo, 1979; 2 \u2013 MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; 3 \u2013 Storetvedt et al., 1987; 4 \u2013 Canilho \n\nand Abranches, 1982; 5 \u2013 Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; 6 \u2013 Rock, 1976; 7 \u2013 Mahmoudi, 1991. \n\nOccurrence Age Reference Method Material \n\nLisbon volcanic complex 72.6 \u00b1 3.1  [1] K-Ar whole rock isochron \nSintra (granite) 81.9 \u00b1 2 [2] K-Ar biotite \n  84.0 \u00b1 1.1 [3] K-Ar K feldspar \n  79.2 \u00b1 0.8 this study U-Pb zircon \nSintra (gabbro)  74.9 \u00b1 1 [3] K-Ar whole rock \n           (syenite) 76.1 \u00b1 1.1 [3] K-Ar whole rock \n  76.4 \u00b1 1.4 [3] K-Ar whole rock \n  78.3 \u00b1 1.8 [3] K-Ar whole rock \nSines 72.0 \u00b1 1.5 [4] Rb-Sr whole rock isochron \n  78.9 \u00b1 1.5 [3] K-Ar diabase dyke \n  62.0 \u00b1 1.3 [3] K-Ar diabase dyke \n  75.2 \u00b1 0.8 [3] K-Ar K feldspar \n  63.8 \u00b1 0.8 [3] K-Ar Kfeldspar \n  75.4 \u00b1 0.6 this study U-Pb zircon \nMonchique 72.0 \u00b1 2 [2] K-Ar mineral separates \n  72.0 \u00b1 1.5 [5] Rb-Sr whole rock isochron \n  72.0 \u00b1 2 [6] Rb-Sr whole rock isochron \n  72.7 \u00b1 2.7 this study Ar-Ar amphibole \n  71.5 \u00b1 3.6  this study Rb-Sr whole rock isochron \nPa\u00e7o d'Ilhas 88.0 \u00b1 2.7 [7] K-Ar biotite \n  86.8 \u00b1 2.5 [7] K-Ar K feldspar \nLoul\u00e9 dykes 71.8 \u00b1 1.9 this study K-Ar biotite \n\nFoz da Fonte sill 93.8 \u00b1 3.9  this study Ar-Ar amphibole \n\n \n\nexposed occurrences were selected for further geochronological studies and/or whole-\n\nrock geochemistry. These include: \n\nA) the granite from the Sintra laccolith body (Terrinha et al., 2003) that had \n\nsystematically yielded ages older than the suite of gabbro-diorite-syenite and associated \n\nbreccias present in the complex (see table 5.1). \n\nB) the Foz da Fonte microgranular tephritic sill, which corresponds to the \n\nsouthernmost intrusion of the Lusitanian basin.  \n\nC) the syenites of the Sines sub-volcanic intrusion. Of all the known alkaline \n\nintrusions, this is the occurrence that shows a wider range of ages (table 5.1). \n\nD) the Monchique alkaline complex. This is the most voluminous of the \n\nsouthern alkaline intrusions, as well as the only one emplaced in unrifted Paleozoic \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n \n\nbasement. The Monchique complex has been dated with both the K-Ar and the Rb-Sr \n\nmethod (table 5.1), with the obtained ages clustering around 72 Ma (72.0 \u00b1 2.0 mean K-\n\nAr ages on mineral separates, MacIntyre &amp; Berger, 1982; 72.0 Ma Rb-Sr whole rock \n\nisochron, Rock, 1976, Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997), although the K-Ar ages obtained \n\nfor K-feldspar and nepheline separates show some spread, attributed to Ar loss \n\n(MacIntyre &amp; Berger, 1982). \n\nE) the ultrabasic lamprophyre dykes that occur within the Loul\u00e9 salt diapir in the \n\nMesozoic Algarve basin. These rocks are representatives of the minor alkaline igneous \n\nactivity hosted in the Algarve Basin.  \n\n \n\n5.2 New geochronological data  \n\nThe samples were prepared for analysis at the Departamento de Geologia da \n\nUniversidade de Lisboa. They were hydraulically crushed, in order to ensure the \n\nremoval of all the signs of alteration, and then reduced in size by a jaw crusher and \n\npowdered in an agate swing mill. \n\nSr isotopic analyses were performed on a VG SECTOR 54 multicollector \n\nthermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) in the Laboratory of Isotope Geology of \n\nthe University of Aveiro, Portugal. Rb and Sr contents were determined by ICP-MS at \n\nActlabs Ancaster, Ontario, Canada. The analytical data were corrected for mass \n\nfractionation using an exponential law (86Sr/88Sr = 0.1194). Average levels of blanks for \n\nSr were in the range 0.25-1.0 ng. The standard NBS-987 gave a repeated value of \n\n0.710254 +/- 34 for (2sd of 49 analyses) during the period of analysis. Regression lines \n\nhave been calculated using the least-squares method of York (1969) as implemented in \n\nthe Isoplot program (Ludwig, 2000). \n\nFor 40Ar/39Ar dating purposes whole rock samples from the Foz da Fonte sill and \n\na Monchique lamprophyre were sent to Actlabs Ancaster, Ontario, Canada, where \n\namphibole separates were obtained by crushing several kg of sample, sieving, washing \n\nand separation using magnetic methods and heavy liquids. The separates were wrapped \n\nin Al foil and loaded in an evacuated and sealed quartz vial with K and Ca salts and flux \n\nmonitors (LP-6 biotite, with and assumed age of 128.1 Ma, Ingamells and Engels, 1976; \n\nOdin et al., 1982). They were irradiated in the McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, \n\nnuclear reactor for 48 hours. After the flux monitors were run, J values were calculated, \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n \n\nusing the measured flux gradient. Neutron gradients did not exceed 0.27% on sample \n\nsize. The Ar isotope composition was measured in a Micromass 5400 static mass \n\nspectrometer. 1200\u00ba C blank of 40Ar did not exceed 2-5*10-10 cc STP. Heating time for \n\neach step was 10 minutes. After each analysis, the extraction temperature is elevated to \n\n1800\u00ba C for few minutes and the furnace is prepared for next analysis. The reported \n\nerrors correspond to 1?. \n\nThe K-Ar age determination was also performed by Actlabs Ancaster, Ontario, \n\nCanada on a biotite separate from an ultrabasic lamprophyre obtained after crushing, \n\nwashing and sieving the sample and then using heavy liquids to obtain the mineral \n\nseparate. The determination of the K concentration was obtained by ICP on Thermo \n\nJarrell Ash Enviro II ICP Spectrometer after an aliquot of the sample was weighted into \n\ngraphite crucible with lithium metaborate/tetraborate flux and fused using LECO \n\ninduction furnace. For the Ar analysis an aliquot of the sample was weighted into an Al \n\ncontainer, loaded into the sample collector of  the extraction system, and degassed at ? \n\n100\u00ba C for two days to remove the surface gases. Argon was extracted from the sample \n\nin a double vacuum furnace at 1700\u00ba C. The Ar concentration was then determined \n\nusing isotope dilution with a 38Ar spike, which is introduced to the sample system prior \n\nto each extraction. The extracted gases are cleaned up in a two step purification system. \n\nPure Ar was then introduced into a custom built magnetic sector mass spectrometer \n\n(Reynolds type) with a Varian CH5 magnet. The ion source has an axial design (Baur-\n\nSigner source), that provides more than 90% transmission and extremely small isotopic \n\nmass discrimination. Ar isotope ratios measurements were corrected for mass \n\ndiscrimination and atmospheric argon was removed assuming that 36Ar is of \n\natmospheric origin. The concentration of radiogenic 40Ar was calculated using a 38Ar \n\nspike. After each analysis the extraction temperature is elevated to 1800\u00ba C for few \n\nminutes and the furnace is prepared for the next analysis. \n\nZircon separates for U-Pb analyses were obtained after crushing, washing and \n\nsieving the rock and then using a standard gravimetric (Wifley and heavy liquids) and \n\nmagnetic (Frantz magnetic separator) separation techniques. Zoning patterns and \n\ninclusions were investigated by cathodoluminiscence and transmitted light microscopy \n\nprior to LA-ICP-MS analyses. Analyses were performed in the Geoanalytical \n\nLaboratory at Washington State University using a New Wave UP213 Nd-YAG (213 \n\nnm) laser ablation system, and a ThermoFinnigan Element2 single collector double \n\nfocusing magnetic sector ICP-MS. The analytical parameters included a repetition rate \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n \n\nof 10 Hz, 40 and 30 microns spot sizes, and a total analysis time of 30 sec per spot. See \n\nChang et al. (2006) for complete analytical and data reduction procedures. Two zircon \n\nsamples with ages of 564 Ma and 55.5 Ma were used as external standards to correct for \n\nelemental fractionation, and mass bias. Accuracy, based on age determinations for \n\nstandards, is generally 2-3% or better. \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Foz da Fonte sill \n\nThe 40Ar/39Ar isotopic analyses for amphibole separates from the Foz da Fonte \n\nsill give a plateau age of 93.6 Ma \u00b1 2.3 Ma, corresponding to 98% of released 39Ar (fig. \n\n5.1). The reverse isochron diagram results in an age of 93.8 \u00b1 3.9 Ma, MSWD = 0.47 \n\nand (40Ar/36Ar)0 = 293 \u00b1 11 (fig. 5.2). The plateau age appears to correspond to the \n\nclosing of the amphibole and provides a good estimate for the rock crystallization age, \n\nwhich corresponds to the oldest known age obtained for the entire alkaline magmatism \n\nof the onshore WIM. \n\n \nTable 2: 40Ar/39Ar analytical data for the Foz da Fonte amphiboles.

According to the published data, the emplacement of the granite (81.9 \u00b1 \n\n0.4 Ma, K-Ar in biotite, MacIntyre &amp; Berger, 1982; 84.0 \u00b1 1.1, K-Ar in K-feldspar, \n\nStoretvedt et al., 1987) occurred before the intrusion of the gabbro and syenite magmas \n\n(76.1 \u00b1 1.1 to  78.3 \u00b1 1.9 Ma, K-Ar in whole rock syenite, Storetvedt et al., 1987; 74.9 \u00b1 \n\n1.0 Ma whole-rock K-Ar in gabbro, Storetvedt et al., 1987). \n\nIn order to obtain a reliable crystallization age for the Sintra granite laccolith and \n\nto assess whether the emplacement of this magma occurred before or after the intrusion \n\nof the other units of the complex, a zircon separate from the granite was dated with the \n\nU-Pb method, using LA-ICP-MS. The results are shown in fig. 5.3 and table 3. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 5.3: U-Pb Tera-Wasserburg plot for the analysed zircons from the Sintra granite. Error ellipses 2? \n\nerror. Ages at 95% confidence level.  \n\n \n\nThe 79.2 \u00b1 0.8 Ma age obtained for the zircons from the Sintra granite (fig. 5.3), \n\nalthough younger than most of the previously published ages (table 5.1), is still older \n\nthan the central values for the known ages for the gabbro and syenite (although within \n\nthe error limits o some of these) and close to the K-Ar age determined in biotite \n\nseparates from that same granite (table 5.1). This is compatible with: (i) field \n\nobservations that show that the gabbroic and syenitic rocks define intrusive \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n \n\nrelationships with the granite and (ii) recently obtained gravity data showing that in this \n\ncomposite massif vertical gabbro plugs intrude an older granite laccolith (Terrinha et al., \n\n2003). Also, the known K-Ar ages for the syenite and gabbro suite can be subject to  \n\npreviously mentioned problems, such as excess Ar, which may exaggerate their age, as \n\nit appears to be the case with the 84 \u00b1 1.1 age obtained in a K-feldspar separate \n\n(Storetvedt et al., 1987) from the Sintra granite. \n\n  \n5.2.3 Sines syenite \n\nThe Sines complex was also previously dated, using the K-Ar and Rb-Sr \n\nmethods. The wide range of \"ages\" displayed by these rocks (78.9 \u00b1 1.5 to 62.0 \u00b1 1.3 \n\nMa K-Ar in whole rock diabase dykes; 75.2 \u00b1 0.8 to 63.8 \u00b1 0.8 Ma K-Ar age in K-\n\nfeldspar from the syenite; 72.0 \u00b1 1.5 Rb-Sr whole rock isochron, Canilho and \n\nAbranches, 1982), particularly the values below 70 Ma are probably the result of a late \n\nthermal overprint that may have caused argon loss (Storetvedt et al., 1987). \n\nWith the aim of constraining the age of installation for this subvolcanic complex, \n\na zircon separate from the syenite facies was dated using U-Pb geochronology by LA-\n\nICP-MS.

The obtained ages cluster around 72 Ma (Rock, 1976, \n\nMacIntyre and Berger, 1982; Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997). \n\nRecent revision of the geological mapping of this complex allowed the \n\nidentification of two concentric units of different nepheline syenites, the inner of which \n\nencloses various bodies of basic and ultra-basic rocks (Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, \n\n2003). We dated some of the nepheline syenites and ultrabasics identified by these \n\nauthors with the aim of clarifying some intriguing ages obtained previously that may be \n\nrelated to the previously identified problem with Ar loss and its effect on some of the K-\n\nAr ages obtained even in feldspar and nepheline separates (MacIntyre and Berger, \n\n1982). \n\nRepresentative samples from the different magmatic units of the Monchique \n\nmassif were selected for Rb-Sr whole-rock dating.

On the reverse isochron \n\nplot, the plateau points define a linear trend with an age of 72.7 \u00b1 2.7 Ma, MSWD = \n\n0.16  (fig. 5.7) and an initial 40Ar/36Ar of 410 \u00b1 103, which is higher than the \n\natmospheric value and suggests presence of excess Ar. The total fusion age (75.6 \u00b1 1.3 \n\nMa) shows a good agreement with the plateau age (74.4 \u00b1 2.0 Ma) but the presence of \n\nexcess Ar suggests that the reverse isochron should reflect the crystalization age for \n\nthese amphiboles. \n\nThe general concordance between the results of 40Ar/39Ar amphibole dating for \n\nthe ultrabasic lamprohyres and the Rb-Sr whole-rock age of the nepheline syenites \n\nappear to indicate that the different units of the Monchique massif may have been \n\nintruded within a short time interval, centered around 72-73 Ma. This is also consistent \n\nwith the geochronological data obtained in previous studies. \n\n \n\n5.2.5 Loul\u00e9 \n\nThe Loul\u00e9 lamprophyre dykes belong to a small group of alkaline intrusives \n\nexposed in the Algarve basin, showing strong petrographical and chemical similarities \n\nwith their equivalents in the nearby Monchique complex (Martins, 1991). \n\nA biotite separate from the Loul\u00e9 lamprophyre dyke was selected for K-Ar \n\nisotopic analysis. The results are summarized in table 5.6. The biotite K-Ar age (71.8 \u00b1 \n\n1.9 Ma) is concordant, within analytical error, with the 40Ar/39Ar age obtained for the \n\nMonchique lamprophyre (74.4 \u00b1 2.0 Ma). This suggests that the K-Ar system was not \n\ndisturbed by subsequent thermal episodes and that the age of the biotite separates from \n\nthis sample still dates the time of crystallization. From the obtained data, it is also \n\npossible to conclude that the lamprophyres intruding both the Monchique complex and \n\nthe Algarve basin are coeval.  \n\n \nTable 5.6: K-Ar analytical data for the biotite from one of the Loul\u00e9 lamprophyres. \n\nLocation Material % K 40Arrad, nl/g % \n40Arair Age, Ma \n\nLoul\u00e9 biotite 6.75+0.13 18.851+0.310 6.5   71.8+1.9 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n \n\n5.3 Summary and discussion \n\nThe new age determinations, combined with previously published data, allow us \n\nto constrain the duration of the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle to circa 22 Ma and to \n\ndefine two distinct pulses of alkaline magmatic activity. The first one (94-88Ma) \n\noccurred during the opening of the Bay of Biscay and consequent rotation of Iberia \n\n(123-80 Ma; Sibuet et al., 2004) and clusters around the Lisbon area (approximately \n\nN38\u00ba 20' and N39\u00ba) where it occurs mainly as sills (Foz da Fonte and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas). The \n\nsecond pulse lasted from 75 Ma to 72 Ma corresponds to a more widespread event with \n\nscattered occurrences from the Algarve Basin in southernmost Portugal (37\u00baN) to the \n\nLisbon area (N39\u00ba) and comprises both intrusive and extrusive complexes. This final \n\npulse is synchronous with the first pulses of tectonic inversion of the Mesozoic basins \n\ndue to the onset of rapid convergence between the African and Iberian plates (e.g. \n\nMougenot, 1980, Terrinha, 1998, Rosembaum et al., 2002). The Sintra granite laccolith \n\nhas an age of ca. 79 Ma and was emplaced between these two pulses of magmatism. \n\nIt should be noted that until the publishing of the new geochronological data by \n\nMiranda et al. (2009), only a single alkaline episode was known in the WIM. However, \n\nconsidering the reduced number of known occurrences with ages compatible with the \n\nfirst pulse, it is possible that the acquisition of further geochronological data might \n\nresult in the recognition of a continuing age spectra between the two proposed pulses. \n\nRadiometric dating of the Sintra granite gives an 79.2 \u00b1 0.8 Ma age, which \n\nalthough equivalent within error to the oldest age obtained for the syenite (78.3 \u00b1 1.9 \n\nMa, whole rock K-Ar, Storetvedt et al., 1987) its still older than the other K-Ar ages \n\nobtained for these rocks (76.4 \u00b1 1.4 and 76.1 \u00b1 1.1 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987). This, \n\ncombined with the observed field cross-cutting relations and geophysical data \n\n(gravimetry and AMS, Terrinha et al., 2003), allows us to hypothesize that the granite \n\ncorresponds to an older phase that is intruded by a more recent gabbro to syenite suite. \n\nAs shown by geochronological and isotopic data, all the members of the \n\nMonchique alkaline suite are co-magmatic and appear to have been emplaced in a short \n\ninterval of time, within the analytical error of the used geochronological methods. \n\nThe similar ages obtained for the lower volume of alkaline magmatism intruding \n\nthe opposite rifted and thinned margins of the Iberian plate (105-69 Ma in the Pyrenees \n\nand Catalan ranges, Fabri\u00e8s et al., 1998; Montigny et al., 1986, Sol\u00e9 et al., 2003) \n\nsuggest a relationship between the Late Cretaceous magmatism and the changes in plate \n\n\n\n \n\n110 \n \n\nkinematics and seafloor spreading geometry contemporaneous with the opening of the \n\nBay of Biscay. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 5.8: Summary for the obtained ages for the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism on the onshore \n\nWIM. Symbols correspond to the reference for the age information: + Mahmoudi, 1991; ? Ferreira e \n\nMacedo, 1979; x Storetvedt et al., 1987; * Grange et al., 2010; ? Miranda et al., 2009 and this study. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n \n\nA recent study by Grange et al. (2010) dated the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill and the Sintra, \n\nSines and Monchique igneous complexes. These authors argue that there is a clear age \n\nprogression from north to south in the alkaline rocks present in the onshore WIM. They \n\ncorrespond to 88.3 \u00b1 0.5 Ma for Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill, while in Sintra the obtained ages were \n\nof 83.4 \u00b1 0.7 for the Sintra diorite, 82.0 \u00b10.7 and 81.7 \u00b1 0.4 for the Sintra granite, and \n\n80.1 \u00b1 1.0 Ma for the Sintra syenite. The Sines complex yielded ages of 77.2 \u00b1 0.6 and \n\n77.2 \u00b1 0.4 for the diorite and of 76.1 \u00b11.3 Ma for the syenite. In Monchique the \n\nobtained ages were of 70.0 \u00b1 2.9 for the gabbro and 68.8\u00b11.0 Ma for the Monchique \n\nnepheline syenite (Grange et al., 2010). \n\nSome of the ages obtained by these authors agree within error with the ones \n\npresented in this study (Sines syenite and Monchique gabbro), while the Sintra granite \n\nseems to show older ages by ? 2 Ma. These aut hors also report the oldest yet ages \n\nobtained for basic rocks and syenites in Sintra as well as for the Sines intrusive basic \n\nrocks. On the other hand, the age obtained for the Monchique nepheline syenites is \n\nequivalent to the youngest ages obtained by the K-Ar method and attributed to Ar loss \n\n(e.g. MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; Storetvedt et al., 1990). \n\nThe presence of zircon fractions that yield younger ages (74.8 to 81.3 Ma, \n\nGrange et al., 2010) in the Sintra diorite and older ages in the Sintra syenite (up to 142 \n\nMa, Grange et al., 2010), Sines diorite (up to 132 Ma, Grange et al., 2010) and of six \n\ntitanite fractions in the Monchique syenite that yield an average age of 70.0 \u00b1 2.9 Ma \n\ncomplicate the interpretation of the results.  \n\nAnother factor that can contribute for the slightly different age values obtained \n\nby these authors could be related with slight difference between the initial Pb isotope \n\ncomposition of the zircon (and titanite) and the feldspar. As the zircon (and titanite) \n\nages have been corrected with the initial Pb measured in the feldspar, a difference \n\nbetween the initial Pb present in the feldspars and in the zircons could result in minor \n\ndiscordance in the obtained ages (Grange et al., 2010).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n \n\n6. Petrography and mineral chemistry \n \n\n6.1. Petrography \n\n \nThis section includes a summarized petrographic characterization of the sampled \n\nrocks within each major occurrence and of the xenoliths that are contained in some of \n\nthem. A detailed petrographic description is beyond the scope of this study, given the \n\ncomplete petrographic works developed by previous authors which are referenced \n\nbelow. \n\nAll of the major mineral phases are identified, along with the observed textural \n\nfeatures. These textures are interpreted in order to extract the highest possible amount of \n\ninformation on the formation conditions of these rocks and xenoliths as well as the \n\nmineral phases that they contain. \n\n \n\n6.1.1. The Lisbon Volcanic Complex \n\n The petrography of the LVC has been covered in detail by Pal\u00e1cios (1985) and \n\nreferences cited therein, so only an abridged petrographic description of the main \n\nlithotypes will be given below. \n\n \n\n- The lava flows: \n\nThe lava flows are mostly constituted by porphyritic alkaline basalts (s.l.) and \n\nbasanites, containing abundant olivine, clinopyroxene, sometimes titanomagnetite and \n\nmore rarely plagioclase phenocrysts in a very fine grained matrix constituted by \n\nplagioclase, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides, more infrequently olivine and in some \n\nvery rare cases even biotite. Brown amphibole (kaersutite) phenocrysts are also present \n\nin some flows (e.g. Negrais) but are seldom observed. \n\nOlivine phenocrysts (Fo85-68) can be euhedral, subhedral and sometimes rounded \n\nand have inclusions of opaque oxides. They are often the only altered mineral observed \n\nin the rock and show substitution by either chlorite or serpentine. In the basal flows that \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n \n\noutcrop in the Ribeira de Fanh\u00f5es and Ramada areas olivine is the only phenocrystic \n\nphase present. \n\nThe clinopyroxene phenocrysts vary in size from 0.5 to over 2 millimeters, are \n\neuhedral and often zoned, showing a stronger pink to purple color in the rims and a \n\nmore pale shade of the same color in the core, which indicates an increase in Ti contents \n\n(0.8-5.5 % TiO2) with progressing crystallization. Sometimes these phenocrysts are \n\nsubhedral and show embayments filled with matrix material. They can also show patchy \n\nzoning or, more rarely, they can show oscillatory zoning as well. Inclusions of Fe-Ti \n\noxides and olivine are common.  \n\nThe Ti-Fe oxides are euhedral to subhedral and often have a bimodal \n\ndistribution, with the flows containing two generations of oxides with different sizes \n\n(phenocrysts and microphenocrysts).  \n\nPlagioclase phenocrysts are very rare and occur in only three slightly more \n\nevolved samples (MgO &lt;8%) such as the Lexim and Besueira vents and the Negrais \n\nflow. \n\nThe rare kaersutite phenocrysts are surrounded by a reaction rim where \n\namphibole breaks down to clinopyroxene, plagioclase and opaque minerals. In some \n\ncases, a pink clinopyroxene rim is observed around this reaction rim. Clinopyroxenes \n\nwith clear rims, but whose core is dotted with oxide and plagioclase inclusions are \n\nrelatively common within the basalts and may correspond to completely retrograded \n\namphiboles where the previously mentioned reaction was completed. \n\nThe crystals in the matrix usually show an elongated shape, except for the Fe-Ti \n\noxides, and a preferred orientation, most likely due to crystallization during flow. The \n\nmatrix is mostly fresh, except for olivine that might be completely altered to chlorite or \n\nserpentine. \n\n \n\n- The necks: \n\nThe necks that acted as conduits for the LVC\u2019s lavas are also basalts and \n\nbasanites which are frequently texturally zoned, with the areas near the contact with the \n\ncountry rock being aphanitic to weakly porphyritic, showing only olivine phenocrysts \n\nand very fine grained matrixes. The interior of the necks, however, is usually very \n\nporphyritic and shows a coarser, sometimes almost granular, matrix. \n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n \n\nVesicles with secondary carbonate or zeolite fillings are rare but amigdulaes \n\nwith radial inward growth of clinopyroxene and plagioclase were observed. \n\nOtherwise, the necks are quite similar to the flows in terms of mineralogy, with \n\nolivine and clinopyroxene being the main phenocrystic phases, along with some minor \n\nFe-Ti oxides. The matrix is generally made of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides \n\nand olivine, with the latter being altered to serpentine at times. \n\nThe clinopyroxene phenocrysts present in the center of the necks can have \n\nolivine and Fe-Ti oxides inclusions both in the core and rims. The Fe-Ti oxide \n\ninclusions can either be numerous and concentrate in the core area, or be located near \n\nthe rims but absent in the core. The rims of these phenocrysts usually show a darker \n\nshade of pink-purple. Concentric zoning is rare but was also observed. \n\nOlivine phenocrysts can be either rounded or subhedral to euhedral, and \n\noccasionally more than one of these habits can be observed in the same thin section. \n\nAlteration to serpentine is common along the rims and fractures of the olivines present \n\nin the more altered samples. \n\nThe Ti-Fe oxides are usually euhedral. \n\nThe matrix is constituted by plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and \n\nolivine. It varies from very fine grained to fine grained from the contact to the center of \n\nthe vent, and its crystals are mostly fresh except for olivine in that might be completely \n\naltered to chlorite or serpentine. \n\n \n\n- The plugs: \n\nFrom the total of 3 small, semi circular basaltic (s.l.) plugs that outcrop in the \n\nRibeira d\u2019Ilhas beach, only the two largest ones (central and southern) were sampled.  \n\nThe southern plug (RM 36) is made out of a very porphyritic rock, with \n\nclinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and pseudomorphs of olivine phenocrysts in a fine grained \n\nmatrix constituted by plagioclase, clinopyroxene, brown amphibole, Fe-Ti oxides. \n\nBrown amphibole megacrysts and xenoliths made out of brown amphibole, Fe-Ti \n\noxides, apatite and clinopyroxene are common. One titanite megacryst with a reaction \n\nrim of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxene was also observed. \n\nThe clinopyroxene phenocrysts can be divided in two groups. The first one is \n\nmade out of clinopyroxene crystals similar to the ones identified in the alkaline basalts, \n\nwith pink phenocrysts showing darker rims and common Fe-Ti oxide inclusions. A \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n \n\nsecond type of clinopyroxene phenocryst was also identified, being characterized by an \n\nirregularly shaped green core, a colorless to light pink mantle and darker pink rim. \n\nThe olivine phenocrysts (Fo86-77) are almost completely pseudomorphosed by \n\nserpentine and carbonate. \n\nThe matrix is fine grained and is constituted mostly by plagioclase, pink \n\nclinopyroxene, brown amphibole and Fe-Ti oxides. It shows some vesicles filled by \n\ncarbonate.  \n\nThe amphibole xenocrysts invariably show numerous small oxide and sulphide \n\ninclusions, as well as reaction rim that is distinguished from the one shown by \n\namphiboles in the lava flows since it is constituted solely by clinopyroxene and opaque \n\nFe-Ti oxides, with plagioclase being absent. \n\nThe central and largest plug is quite similar to its southern counterpart, with the \n\ndifference that a central, vesicular and more altered facies can be observed. Also, brown \n\namphibole is absent in the matrix of the central plug, and the olivine phenocrysts are \n\nmostly unaltered in the fresher outer facies (RM 37). Otherwise it is also a very \n\nporphyritic rock with phenocrysts of olivine, Fe-Ti oxides and the same two kinds of \n\nclinopyroxene in a matrix constituted by plagioclase, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides. \n\n \n\n- The Oeiras-Cascais dykes: \n\nMost of the dykes associated with the LVC are extremely altered, to the point in \n\nwhich their original mineralogy is no longer identifiable, making their classification \n\nexceedingly difficult.  \n\nThe only fresh basic alkaline dykes available for sampling are located in the \n\ncoastline within the vicinities of Oeiras and Cascais. Although the exact age of these \n\ndykes remains unknown, geochemical affinities and the proximity of LVC\u2019s flows \n\nindicate that these were likely feeders for the subaerial magmatism (Miranda et al., \n\n2005). \n\nThe dykes can be separated in two main categories. Some are porphyritic \n\nbasalts, and the others more evolved and lighter colored hawaiite-like rocks. \n\nThe basalts are usually very porphyritic, with abundant olivine and in some \n\ncases clinopyroxene phenocrysts in a fine grained matrix constituted by plagioclase, \n\nclinopyroxene, serpentinized olivine and Fe-Ti oxides. The olivine is commonly altered \n\nto serpentine or carbonate. Carbonates also fill all of the vesicles and fractures and can \n\neven substitute clinopyroxene in more altered rocks. \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n \n\n \nFig. 6.1: Several textural aspects in the collected samples. Width of field of vision ? 2.5 mm.  A, B) the \n\nRibeira d\u2019Ilhas central plug: olivine, green cored and normal clinopyroxene phenocrysts; C, D) Negrais \n\nflow: amphibole with reaction rim of clinopyroxene, plagioclase and opaque minerals, clinopyroxene and \n\nolivine phenocrysts; E) Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug: amphibole with reaction rim of clinopyroxene, plagioclase \n\nand opaque minerals in a matrix of clinopyroxene, plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxides; F) Malveira da Serra sill: \n\namphibole and green cored clinopyroxene aggregate in the a clinopyroxene, amphibole, Fe-Ti oxide and \n\nfeldspar matrix; G) Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill: detail of xenolith showing mostly clinopyroxene and amphibole; \n\nH) Loul\u00e9 lamprophyre C-20: general aspect showing biotite and green cored and normal clinopyroxenes.  \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n \n\nThe hawaiites are usually more vesicular, have coarser but still fine grained \n\ntextures, and their phenocrystic phases can be brown amphibole, clinopyroxene and \n\nplagioclase. The matrix is fine grained and constituted by plagioclase, clinopyroxene, \n\nand Fe-Ti oxides, with brown amphibole being present in some cases where olivine is \n\nnot found.  \n\nAmygdulae with larger plagioclase and amphibole crystals are common in these \n\nrocks. Vesicules and fractures are commonly filled with secondary carbonate. \n\n \n\n- The sills: \n\nNumerous sills are integrated into the LVC. All of them were described by \n\nPal\u00e1cios (1985), with the ones present in the An\u00e7os-Montelevar region being the subject \n\nof a specific study by Matos Alves et al. (1972). \n\nThe Lomba dos Pianos sill has a porphyritic texture with clinopyroxene, \n\nplagioclase and rare olivine phenocrysts occurring in a fine grained matrix with \n\nplagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and accessory  feldspar, biotite, apatite, titanite \n\nand analcime. This matrix can show significant chloritic alteration. Amphibole \n\nmegacrysts with reaction rims of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and oxides are found in this \n\nsill, but are rare. This rock has lamprophyric affinities and has been previously \n\nclassified as a teschenite (Mahmoudi, 1991). \n\nThe olivine phenocrysts are in the majority of cases completely altered to pale \n\ngreen mineral that might correspond to chlorite.  \n\nAs in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug, there are two types of clinopyroxene phenocrysts \n\npresent, the clinopyroxene crystals with pink cores with darker rims and a second type \n\nof clinopyroxene phenocryst with irregularly shaped green cores, colorless to light pink \n\nmantles and darker pink rims. \n\nPlagioclase phenocrysts can be euhedral or have rounded edges. They often \n\nshow concentric zoning or rims with optical characteristics that are different from their \n\ncores. Their cores are frequently subject of some sericitic alteration while the rims can \n\nremain unaltered. \n\nAlso present are clinopyroxenes dotted with numerous oxide and plagioclase \n\ninclusions that may correspond to completely retrograded amphiboles. \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n \n\nIn certain parts of the sill it is possible to observe small layers with a coarser \n\nadcumulate texture. They are constituted mostly by plagioclase with euhedral cores and \n\nlarge cloudy rims with interstitial clinopyroxene, feldspar, and Fe-Ti oxides and quartz.  \n\n \n\nThe Montelavar sill displays a bimodal texture with porphyrocrystals of feldspar \n\nand plagioclase and grey to colorless clinopyroxene that are inserted in a medium \n\ngrained matrix of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and interstitial feldspar, \n\napatite and rare quartz. This sill could be classified as a monzodiorite. \n\nThe plagioclase megacrysts (An64-14) are often zoned and can display some \n\nsericitic alteration. Chlorite and other philosilicates, along with some rare carbonate, are \n\nthe main alteration phases seen in the matrix. \n\n \n\nThe An\u00e7os sill has a porphyroid texture with plagioclase, feldspar, and colorless \n\nclinopyroxene porphyrocristals in a fine grained matrix composed of plagioclase, \n\nclinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and accessory titanite and apatite and sometimes even \n\nquartz. The matrix and feldspar phenocrysts show some alteration to phyllossilicates \n\nand carbonate. Similarly to the Montelevar sill, this intrusion could be classified as a \n\nmonzodiorite. \n\n \n\nThe Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill shows a bimodal granular texture, with larger green \n\nclinopyroxene, titanite, Fe-Ti oxides and rare brown amphibole crystals in a fine grained \n\nmatrix of mostly plagioclase, colorless clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides with accessory \n\napatite, biotite, titanite, zeolites and analcime. Given its relative abundance in foids, this \n\nrock can be classified as a foid monzodiorite. \n\nThis sill is formed by a very vesicular rock with most of these being filled by \n\nfibrous zeolite.  \n\nOne of the samples collected in this sill contained a medium grained xenolith \n\nmade out of mostly brown amphibole and greenish clinopyroxene with accessory Fe-Ti \n\noxides and apatite. \n\n \n\nThe Alqueid\u00e3o sill has a medium grained texture, with mostly plagioclase, Fe-Ti \n\noxides, clinopyroxene and interstitial feldspar. It is very altered, with most of the mafics \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n \n\nbeing replaced by fibrous looking minerals, probably phyllossilicates, while the \n\ndominating plagioclase remained relatively fresh. In some of the more altered samples, \n\neven plagioclase could show important chloritic and sericitic alteration. Like other sills \n\nin the region, this intrusion could be classified as a monzodiorite. \n\n \n\n6.1.2. Malveira da Serra sill \n\n \nThis sill is constituted by a mafic, very porphyritic rock with phenocrysts of \n\nbrown amphibole, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and olivine pseudomorphosed by \n\nchlorite in a very fine matrix of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, brown amphibole, Fe-Ti \n\noxides, biotite, apatite and olivine pseudomorphosed by chlorite. According to its \n\ntexture and mineralogy, this sill can be classified as a camptonite (Rock, 1986).  \n\nVesicles are rare but are usually filled with carbonate.  \n\nSimilarly to the Lomba dos Pianos sill and the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug, we can \n\nobserve two types of clinopyroxene phenocrysts, namely clinopyroxene crystals with \n\npink phenocrysts with darker rims and also green cored clinopyroxenes with irregularly \n\nshaped green cores, surrounded by a colorless to light pink mantle and darker pink rim. \n\nThe brown amphibole phenocrysts can also be divided in two groups, one with \n\nabundant small oxide inclusions in the darker cores, which are enveloped by a lighter \n\nbrown mantle and a darker rim. This group also commonly shows clinopyroxene and \n\nolivine inclusions, which may themselves contain oxide inclusions. The second type of \n\nobserved brown amphibole has a lighter brown core and a darker brown rim and less \n\nabundant inclusions. \n\nSome of the Fe-Ti oxide phenocrysts have distinctive irregularly shaped rims, \n\nresembling small appendixes.  \n\n \n6.1.3. Mafra plug  \n\n \nThe Mafra plug is a gabbroic rock with a bimodal granular poikilitic texture, \n\nwith the larger brown amphibole and clinopyroxenes involving plagioclase (An78-33), \n\nolivine, biotite, Fe-Ti oxides and rarer nepheline and apatite. Given the presence of \n\nnepheline, this rock classifies as a foid gabbro. \n\n\n\n \n\n120 \n \n\nThe clinopyroxenes are commonly zoned, with darker purple rims, as a \n\nconsequence of enrichment in Ti (TiO2 1.2-3.8%) or can even show oscillatory zoning. \n\nOlivine (Fo86-85) is often altered to chlorite. Amphibole seems to be a later phase, as it \n\nenvelops both these minerals. \n\nAll these are inserted in a fine grained matrix of plagioclase, smaller \n\nclinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, nepheline, apatite and biotite. \n\n \n\n6.1.4. Foz da Fonte sill \n\n \nThis tephritic sill has a fine grained texture with plagioclase, brown amphibole, \n\nclinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, and accessory apatite and feldspathoids. Inclusions of \n\noxides are common in amphiboles and plagioclase.  \n\nSecondary carbonate can be observed, filling vesicles and fractures. \n\n \n\n6.1.5. Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill \n\n \nThe Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill is a layered intrusion, displaying two different lithotypes \n\nwith different mineralogies and textures. Its petrographic features are discussed in detail \n\nby Mahmoudi (1991). \n\nThe mafic layers have a monzogabbroic composition and display a medium \n\ngrained texture with dominating plagioclase (An72-20) and lesser biotite, clinopyroxene, \n\nFe-Ti oxides and intersticial feldspsar. Often the plagioclases show a more irregular, \n\nprobably Na-rich rim, as a likely result of growth from an intercumulus liquid. The \n\nplagioclases might show larger crystals than the remaining minerals that constitute the \n\nrock. \n\nThe felsic monzosyenite layers have a similar texture, only with more abundant \n\nplagioclase (> 75%) and less abundant, smaller, mafic minerals. \n\nBoth the varieties are considerably altered, with the clinopyroxenes being almost \n\ncompletely replaced by alteration products and carbonate substituting both plagioclase \n\nand mafic minerals as well as occupying interstices. Also, the plagioclases commonly \n\nshow alteration to phyllossilicates. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n \n\nFig. 6.2: Several textural aspects in intrusive samples. Width of field of vision ? 2.5 mm.

H) detail of the Montelevar sill in plane polarized light, \n\nshowing clinopyroxene and plagioclase intergrowth. \n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n \n\n6.1.6. The Sintra mafic rocks \n\n \nThe two gabbros sampled in the Sintra complex show extremely varied textures. \n\nThese and the other lithologies present in this complex have been extensively described \n\nby Matos Alves (1964), Wright (1969), Sparks and Wadge (1976) and Leal (1990). \n\nThe Peninha gabbro has medium grained to coarser, poikilitic textures and is \n\nconstituted mostly by plagioclase (An72-20), clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, interstitial \n\nfeldspar  and  apatite,  as well as by brown amphibole  that envelops  all of the  previous \n\nphases. The brown amphibole can in addition show biotite growing on its rims or partial \n\nreplacement by secondary, fibrous, green amphibole. \n\nBesides green amphibole, the other secondary alteration phases present are \n\nepidote, feldspar, chlorite, rare carbonate and even more rarely, tourmaline. These \n\nminerals can be either concentrated in late veins or dispersed in more plagioclase-rich \n\nareas. Plagioclase and feldspar can also display some sericitic alteration.  \n\nLocally the amphibole can form aggregates that give the rock a glomoporphyric \n\ntexture that is characteristic of many of its outcrops (see fig. 4.9). \n\nThe gabbros in the Az\u00f3ia outcrop show a coarse grained poikilitic and even \n\nglomorporphyric texture, with brown amphibole envolving clinopyroxene, plagioclase, \n\nFe-Ti oxides and apatite. Accessory minerals include biotite, which can be observed \n\ngrowing in the rims of amphibole crystals, as well as some interstitial feldspar and a \n\nmineral completely pseudomorphosed by alteration products, possibly olivine. \n\nThese gabbroic rocks are substantially more altered than those at Peninha, often \n\nshowing a greener color due to a higher degree of transformation of brown amphibole \n\ninto fibrous green amphibole, chlorite substituting clinopyroxenes and plagioclase, and \n\nto the existence of veins of feldspar, epidote and carbonate that substitute the original \n\nmineralogy. The alteration seems to affect the plagioclase and feldspars more than it \n\naffects the other minerals. \n\nThe diorite, sampled in the Malveira da Serra-Az\u00f3ia outcrop, is similar to these \n\nmore altered gabbros, except it has more abundant plagioclase and biotite and less \n\nclinopyroxene, brown amphibole and Fe-Ti oxides. Otherwise it shows similar textural \n\nfeatures, with the amphiboles enveloping clinopyroxene, apatite and opaque minerals \n\nand analogous secondary alteration phases, except in this case the green amphibole is \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n \n\nmuch more common and often completely substitutes the rims of clinopyroxene and \n\namphibole. \n\n \n6.1.7. The Sines mafic rocks \n\n \n\nThe Sines igneous complex has two gabbro outcrops with distinct textural and \n\nmineralogical features (see 4.1.7). These outcrops, as well as the remaining lithologies \n\npresent in the complex are described in detail by Canilho (1972). \n\nThe gabbros that outcrop at Praia Vasco da Gama are similar to the ones \n\nobserved in Sintra and show a very coarse, granular poikilitic texture with very large \n\ncrystals of brown amphibole enveloping plagioclase, apatite, Fe-Ti oxides and rare \n\nclinopyroxene. The amphibole can be surrounded by biotite in some areas. Interstitial \n\nfeldspar and biotite are also observed.Secondary alteration minerals include chlorite and \n\nrarer epidote. \n\nThe Pedras Negras gabbro shows macroscopic layering, smaller grain size and a \n\ndifferent mineralogy. These rocks have an orthocumulate texture where clinopyroxene \n\nand olivine (Fo70-67) megacrysts are surrounded by a finer matrix of plagioclase (An82-\n\n48), Fe-Ti oxides and some clinopyroxene and olivine, as well as rare apatite and biotite. \n\nThe megacrysts can sometimes be enveloped by later brown amphibole. \n\nAlteration is present, although it is less important than in the amphibole rich \n\ngabbros. It is characterized by the alteration of olivine to serpentine and oxides, and of \n\nplagioclase to phyllossilicates and chlorite. In more altered zones, green amphibole and \n\nphyllossilicates may be present. \n\nThe diorite was sampled near the gabbro outcrop of Praia Vasco da Gama and \n\ncorresponds to a medium grained rock constituted by abundant plagioclase, colorless to \n\nbrown clinopyroxene, biotite, brown amphibole, Fe-Ti oxides and accessory amounts of \n\napatite and titanite. The most important alteration mineral is chlorite that affects mostly \n\nplagioclase, clinopyroxene and biotite. \n\nThe cumulate and more basic nature of the Pedras Negras gabbro in Sines \n\nmay indicate that this outcrop is representative of a deeper level in the magma \n\nchamber when compared to its southern counterpart that outcrops in Praia Vasco da \n\nGama. As the amphibole rich Praia Vasco da Gama gabbro also shows a much \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n \n\ncoarser texture, it could represent a higher, more evolved and hydrated part of the \n\nsame magma chamber that cooled later than the deeper Pedras Negras gabbro.  \n\nThe different gabbroic outcrops are separated by one E-W trending fault, whose \n\nmovement might have caused uplift of the northern block causing the deeper level of the \n\nmagma chamber, represented by the olivine rich Pedras Negras gabbro, to be exposed. \n \n\n6.1.8. The Monchique mafic and ultramafic rocks \n\n \nThe samples used in this study were previously described and classified by \n\nValadares (2004), and include essexites, sieno-diorites and also ijolites and \n\nlamprophyres. \n\nThe ijolite has a poikilitic texture where nepheline and plagioclase involve \n\npurple to pink clinopyroxene, greenish clinopyroxene, biotite, Fe-Ti oxides, titanite, \n\nand apatite. In the lamprophyre, larger brown amphibole, clinopyroxene and olivine \n\ncrystals are observed in a finer matrix of clinopyroxene, nepheline, feldspar, Fe-Ti \n\noxides, biotite and apatite. The clinopyroxenes and amphiboles seem to have \n\ncontinued growing until the latest crystallization stages since they can involve \n\npoikilitically the matrix crystals. \n\nThe remaining rocks are mostly theralites (nepheline gabbros) constituted by \n\nclinopyroxene, plagioclase, more or less abundant brown amphibole, feldspar, \n\nbiotite, nepheline, Fe-Ti oxides and apatite, with textures varying from coarsely \n\ngranular, to poikilitical and to bimodal. \n\n The sieno-diorites show the same mineralogy, but are richer in plagioclase, \n\nfeldspar and nepheline than the theralites.  \n\nThese rocks are mostly fresh but some minor alteration is observed, with the \n\nmain alteration phases present being sericite, carbonate and actinolite. \n\n \n6.1.9. The Loul\u00e9 dykes \n\n \nAlthough these dykes were both sampled in the same location (the Loul\u00e9 salt \n\nmine) and quite close to each other, they are texturally and mineralogically distinct. \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n \n\nDyke C-20 is a very porphyritic rock, showing phenocrysts of clinopyroxene and \n\nphlogopite in a fine grained matrix of plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxides, clinopyroxene, \n\nnepheline and rare carbonate. This carbonate might be primary since this rock is not in \n\ncontact with carbonated country rocks on the sampling location. Given its texture and \n\nmineralogy, this dyke can be classified as a monchiquite lamprophyre (Rock, 1986). \n\nThe clinopyroxene phenocrysts show, as in other rocks described in this section, \n\ntwo types of cores. There are clinopyroxene phenocrysts that are light pink to colorless \n\nin the cores and with darker rims, as well as green cored clinopyroxenes with irregularly \n\nshaped green cores, surrounded by a colorless to light pink mantle and darker pink rim. \n\nThe biotite phenocrysts often show inclusions of Fe-Ti oxides and/or apatite and \n\ncan partially involve clinopyroxene crystals. \n\nIn its turn, dyke C-12-1  seems more basaltic as it shows phenocrysts of rounded \n\nolivine completely substituted by serpentine, plus some rarer clinopyroxene in a fine \n\ngrained matrix of clinopyroxene, plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxides, apatite and minor biotite. \n\nAlthough the olivine phenocrysts are completely altered, the remaining rock seems \n\nquite fresh.  \n\n \n\n6.1.10. The Fontanelas seamount \n\n \nAll of the samples from igneous rocks dredged from the Fontanelas seamount \n\ncorresponded to pillow lavas and hyaloclastites and show important signs of alteration, \n\nincluding calcite filled vesicles and an overall brown to greenish color. \n\nIn thin section these rocks are very vesicular (they can have over 40% vesicles), \n\nhave an aphanitic to porphyritic texture, with a deeply altered groundmass. \n\nThe porphyritic rocks show phenocrysts of extremely altered olivine, but \n\nunaltered clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and sometimes even amphibole.  \n\nThe clinopyroxene phenocrysts present are of the green cored and normal (pink \n\nto purple) varieties already observed and described in outcrops of the same basic \n\nalkaline nature on land. \n\nAlteration in the groundmass is pervasive, but still, the clinopyroxenes and \n\noxides are always identifiable matrix phases, with plagioclase being present only in the \n\n\n\n \n\n126 \n \n\nfresher samples where it has not been substituted by secondary alteration phases, such \n\nas clays or carbonate.  \n\nThe vesicles are commonly partially or completely filled with carbonate, clays \n\nand even Fe-Mn oxides. \n\nOne sample shows a single xenolith that is constituted by one very large brown \n\namphibole with clinopyroxene, biotite, titanite and apatite inclusions. \n\n \n\n6.1.11 Xenoliths and megacrysts \n\n \nAlthough xenoliths are quite rare in these rocks, they can be found in reasonable \n\namounts at the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug, in the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill and more rarely in the \n\nFontanelas seamount. Most of them are of igneous origin and show shapes that vary \n\nbetween sub-angular and rounded in cross section.  \n\nSedimentary xenoliths of limestone with significant siliciclastic component were \n\nalso identified in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug, but are very rare. \n\nIn addition to the xenoliths, megacrysts of amphibole and clinopyroxene can \n\nalso be found in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug and Lomba dos Pianos sill.  \n\nThe amphiboles invariably show a rim of pink clinopyroxene and very small \n\noxides. This rim distinguishes these amphibole megacrysts from the ones described in \n\nthe in the Negrais flow which show a reaction rim of clinopyroxene + plagioclase + \n\noxides. \n\nThe igneous xenoliths are consistently olivine free and typically constituted \n\nmainly by brown amphibole and clinopyroxene, that may have green or colorless cores, \n\nwith accessory apatite, Fe-Ti oxides, and in the case of the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill and \n\nFontanelas lavas, minor titanite, with the second additionally having biotite. They can \n\nbe therefore classified as hornblendites or (hornblende bearing) clinopyroxenites, \n\ndepending if either hornblende or clinopyroxene are modally dominant, respectively. \n\nGrain size among the crystals contained in the xenoliths is is usually constant \n\nwithin single xenoliths, but is heterogenous between different xenoliths, and can \n\nvarying between 0.2 and more than 1 mm.  \n\nPlagioclase is very rare, with only one small xenolith containing this mineral, \n\nalong with green cored clinopyroxene and apatite. \n\n\n\n \n\n127 \n \n\nMost of the xenoliths show signs of reaction with the magma where they are \n\ninserted, resulting in the formation of a rim of clinopyroxene and oxides that encloses \n\nthem. \n\nThe xenolith in the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill (fig. 6.1G) and some in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas \n\nplug have a granular, fine to medium grained texture that shows hints of \n\nrecrystalyzation, since all the grains have sutured boundaries, are approximately \n\nequidimensional, and often show amphibole growing in clinopyroxene junctions.  \n\nThe clinopyroxenes in these xenoliths can show a sieved texture with blebs of \n\nbrown amphibole growing inside it. Sieve textures can be interpreted as resulting from \n\ncorrosion of minerals in a magma with which they are not in equilibrium, or as a \n\nconsequence of incipient partial melting. In some cases, clinopyroxenes can also display \n\noxide exsolution lamelae along cleavage planes. \n\nIn some of the coarser grained xenoliths and in most of the xenocrysts, the \n\namphiboles are dotted with small oxide and sulphide inclusions, giving them a darker, \n\nunclear aspect.  \n\nGabbroic to dioritic and syenitic xenoliths containing plagioclase and K feldspar \n\nwere also reported by Pal\u00e1cios (1985) in the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill, but were not sampled in \n\nthis study. The same author also sampled only one peridotitic xenolith in the LCV that \n\ncontained olivine showing deformation bands, with the remaining minerals being \n\nclinopyroxe and oxides. \n\n \n\n6.1.12 Summary and discussion \n\n \nThe petrographic descriptions made above allow for the inference of a \n\nsimplified crystallization order in the observed rocks, leaving out some of the more \n\nspecific mineral assemblages (fig. 6.3). \n\nThe first phases to crystallize would then be Cr-Al rich spinels (Cr2O3 35-7 \n\n%, Al2O3 19-5 %, see 6.2.5) followed by olivine, in which they are often included. \n\nOlivine is an important constituent in most basic rocks but does not occur in the \n\nmore evolved basic rocks (e.g. some of the Sintra, Sines and Monchique gabbros) \n\nand in the intermediate rocks. \n\nThey are followed by Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxenes, with the latter \n\nshowing inclusions of all the previously mentioned these minerals. Fe-Ti oxide and \n\n\n\n \n\n128 \n \n\nclinopyroxene crystallization will continue throughout the evolution of these rocks, \n\nwhile Cr-Al spinel is only found in the more basic, undifferentiated terms.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.3: Diagram showing a simplified crystallization order for the studied samples.  \n\n \n\nAmphibole might be the fourth phase to crystallize in the basaltic rocks. \n\nThese minerals sometimes show inclusions of olivine, Fe-Ti oxides and \n\nclinopyroxene in the basic porphyritic rocks. But in the gabbros amphibole \n\ncrystallization should be preceded by plagioclase since in these rocks amphibole \n\ndistinctively shows plagioclase inclusions. \n\nApatite should start to crystallize approximately at the same time as \n\nplagioclase and amphibole since it is often found in the matrix of basaltic rocks and \n\nin inclusions on amphibole found in gabbros. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.4: Conditions under which hornblende grains can form pyroxene + plagioclase + Fe-Ti oxides rims. The solid \nline shows the stability field of hornblende after (Rutherford and Hill, 1993). Adapted from Plechov et al., 2008. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n \n\nFeldspar appears relatively late in some of the gabbros but its crystallization \n\ncontinues in the intermediate rocks. \n\nThe existence of amphibole phenocrysts reacting with the liquid resulting on \n\nthe formation of rims of oxides, plagioclase and clinopyroxene in the basal lava \n\nflows of the LVC (e.g. Negrais) might be caused by pressure release and \n\ndehydration during ascension and eruption, which led to the destabilization of the \n\namphibole (fig. 6.4). Given that in some cases the amphibole did not have time to \n\nfully react and complete the transformation into these products, it can be speculated \n\nthat the ascension and eruption of these magmas was relatively fast, in a scale of \n\ndays (e.g. Rutherford and Hill, 1993; Rutherford and Devine, 2003). \n\nAlternatively, amphibole destabilization can also occur isobarically, during \n\nthe recharge of a magma chamber with a more basic, hotter magma (e.g. Ruthford \n\nand Devine, 2003; Plechov et al., 2008). The recharging liquid can also be drier, \n\nleading to further destabilization of the hydrated minerals (e.g. Reagan et al., 1987). \n\nThe distinction between these two hypotheses for amphibole rim formation will be \n\ndiscussed in further detail in section 6.2. \n\nAmphibole is also found to be frequently associated with apatite in \n\nxenocrysts (with the apatites occurring as inclusions in the amphibole) and \n\nxenoliths. This association has been interpreted by some authors as resulting from \n\nthe crystallization of carbonatitic or alkaline silicic carbonated magmas at mantle \n\ndepths (Wass, 1979; O\u2019Reilly and Griffin, 2000). \n\nThe presence of xenoliths, whose textures show evidence for \n\nrecrystallization, and in the case of the sieve textured clinopyroxenes, even partial \n\nmelting, supports the notion that these might have formed in deeper magma \n\nchamber or conduit. They were later remobilized by a new, hotter magma pulse \n\nwhere they reequilibrated and perhaps even underwent partial melting due to \n\nheating and decompression during ascension. \n\nAccordingly, the observation of both recrystallization in xenoliths and \n\nreaction rims around amphibole xenocrysts is evidence for reequilibration and \n\nadjustment to lower pressure and/or higher temperature conditions. \n\nFinally, the simultaneous existence of two different kinds of clinopyroxene \n\nin the same magma, as observed in several of the intrusive rocks, might be an \n\nindicator of magma mixing and therefore, a complex pre-installation history (e.g. \n\n\n\n \n\n130 \n \n\nDuda and Schminke, 1985; Dobosi, 1989; Dobosi and Fodor, 1992; Martins, 1999; Pilet \n\net al., 2002), and shall be discussed in more detail in the mineral chemistry section \n\n(6.2). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n131 \n \n\n6.2. Mineral Chemistry \n\n \nThe chemical characterization of the main petrographic phases of the sampled \n\nlithologies was done by Electronic Microprobe Analysis in the Laborat\u00f3rio de \n\nMicrossonda Electr\u00f3nica of the Centro de Geologia da Universidade de Lisboa under \n\nthe technical supervision and orientation of Dr. Pedro Celestino Reis. \n\nThe analyses were performed on polished thin sections using a JEOL JXA 8200 \n\nelectron microprobe. An acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 25 nA \n\nwere used. The electron beam was focused to 5 \u00b5m diameter. Typical uncertainties are \n\nbelow 2% for the major oxides.  \n\nThe analyzed elements in each mineral group were calibrated using the standards \n\nindicated in table 1 in annex IV.  \n\nThe more relevant lithologies in most of the sampled occurrences were chosen \n\nfor analysis, with the addition of a sample from the Monchique nepheline syenites in \n\norder to compare the composition of their green clinopyroxenes with the green cores \n\nrecognized in the clinopyroxenes of some mafic rocks (see section 6.1). \n\n \n\n6.2.1 Olivine \n\n \nIn the studied rocks, olivine is a major constituent of basalts, as well as of some \n\nof the lamprophyres, where it occurs as a phenocryst phase. It is also present in some of \n\nthe gabbros. The structural formula of the analyzed olivines was calculated on a \n\nbasis of 4 oxygens.  \n\nThe chemical variation of the olivine mineral group can be described as a solid \n\nsolution series between forsterite, an Mg rich component (Fo: Mg2SiO4), and fayalite, \n\nthe Fe rich component (Fa: Fe2SiO4). It shows a tendency for increasing the fayalite \n\ncontents with differentiation, whereas the more Fo rich compositions are thought to be \n\nproducts of crystallization from less evolved magmas characterized by lower Mg/(Mg + \n\nFe ratios. \n\nCompositional variations in this mineral are described using the forsterite (Fo = \n\n100 \u00d7 [Mg/(Mg + Fe)]) contents as a differentiation index, as shown in figs. 6.5-6.  \n\n\n\n \n\n132 \n \n\nOlivines from basalts show some compositional variation, with the cores of \n\nphenocrysts being more Fo rich (Fo > 85%) than their rims, than the microphenocrysts \n\nand than the matrix minerals. Taking into consideration that ???\n??/??? (with D being the \n\npartition coefficient, in this case between Mg and the olivine-liquid pair DMg = \n\n???\n?? /???\n\n??? ) tends to increase with decreasing temperature (e.g Roeder and Emslie, 1970), \n\nsuch compositional evolution is interpreted as a result of progressive Mg depletion in \n\nthe liquid with olivine crystallization in a cooling magmatic system.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.5: classification of the analyzed olivines according to their abundances in forsterite (Fo \u2013 Mg2SiO4) \n\nand fayalite (Fe2SiO4). \n\n \n\nThe olivines in the Mafra gabbroic plug also show relatively high Fo contents (> \n\n83%), while the ones in the Sines gabbro show the lower Fo and higher Fa contents in \n\nall of the analyzed rocks, reflecting crystallization from a less Mg rich, more evolved \n\nliquid.  \n\n In general, MnO contents increase with decreasing forsterite contents while NiO \n\nand SiO2 decrease (fig. 6.6). CaO contents of olivines show two distinct trends: the first \n\none characterized by the progressive increase of CaO with decreasing Fo and is seen in \n\nthe LVC\u2019s rocks and in the Mafra gabbro, while a second trend is discernable in the \n\nSines gabbro and in crystals with Fo &lt;73%, marked by a decrease in CaO. \n\n\n\n \n\n133 \n \n\nThe decrease in NiO agrees with progressive depletion in this element in the \n\nliquid due to earlier olivine and clinopyroxene crystallization.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.6: Variation of the concentrations of CaO, MnO, NiO and SiO2 with the content in Forsterite (Fo) \n\nfor the analysed olivines. \n\n \n\nDuring olivine crystallization the rapid reduction of the Ni contents in the melt \n\nwould create space in the crystal lattice of olivine, which can lead to increasing Ca \n\nsubstitution. However, the crystallization of Ca-rich clinopyroxene and plagioclase \n\nwould result in the depletion of Ca in the residual melt, which is probably the reason for \n\nthe decrease in CaO contents observed in olivine below ? Fo 73. Therefore, the notorious \n\ndecrease in CaO seen in the Sines gabbro is likely to be the result of continuing olivine \n\n\n\n \n\n134 \n \n\ncrystallization after the onset of clinopyroxene and/or plagioclase crystallization and \n\nremoval, since these minerals incorporate more CaO.  \n\nThe rise in MnO in the olivine composition with decreasing Fo in the basalts is \n\nrelated to the higher availability of this incompatible element in more evolved liquids \n\nand due to the increasing compatibility of Mn in more Fa rich olivines (e.g. Beattie et \n\nal., 1991). The lack of a Mn increase in the more Fa rich olivines from the Sines \n\ngabbros is probably due to reduced Mn availability caused by its removal from the melt \n\nby the precipitation of a more Mn rich Fe-Ti oxides (MnO 0.7-1.2%). \n\nThe distribution coefficient for the Fe/Mg ratio between olivine and liquid \n\n(????/??\n??????  = (???\n\n?? /???\n?? ) ? (???\n\n???/???\n??? ), where X is the molar fraction) was also \n\ncalculated, assuming the whole rock analysis as representative of the liquid from which \n\nthe olivines crystallized, and that this liquid would have a Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of 0.2 \n\n(Middlemost, 1989 in Rollinson, 1993). The ????/??\n??????  value is independent of \n\ntemperature and pressure variations and is of approximately 0.3 \u00b1 0.03 for situations \n\nwhere the olivine is in equilibrium with the composition of the magmatic liquid (Roeder \n\nand Emslie, 1970; Beattie et al., 1991). \n\nAssuming that there is equilibrium and ????/??\n??????  = 0.3 \u00b1 0.03, the composition \n\nof the possible olivine-liquid pairs can be calculated using the following expression: \n\n \n\n????/??\n?????? = ?(? ? ????) ? ??#???? ? [???? ? (? ? ??#???)] \n\n \n\nwhere ??#??? =  \n??????\n\n(??????+??????)\n and ???? is the calculated forsterite content of the \n\nolivines. \n\nThe resulting curves were plotted on fig. 6.7 together with the analyzed rock-\n\nmineral pairs. \n\nMost of the calculated ????/??\n??????  values were different from the expected average \n\nof 0.3 \u00b1 0.03 predicted for olivines in equilibrium with the host magma (Roeder and \n\nEmslie, 1970). The higher values correspond mostly to the ones observed in the rims of \n\nphenocrysts and in matrix crystals and occur in the samples from the LVC\u2019s Monte \n\nServes neck, the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug, and especially the Sines gabbro. The lower values \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n \n\noccur only in the Negrais lava flow of the LVC and are typically found in crystal cores \n\n(fig. 6.7). The only olivines that show ????/??\n??????  values indicative of equilibrium \n\nbetween the crystal and the host liquid are some of the crystals present in the Monte \n\nServes neck, the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug and the Negrais flow.  \n\n \nFig. 6.7: Fosterite contents of the olivines vs. whole rock composition. Also represented is the variation \n\nof the forsterite content in olivines with the changing Mg# of a magmatic liquid for rocks with ????/??\n??????  \n\nvalues between 0.27 and 0.33. \n\n \n\nThe higher than expected ????/??\n??????  values mean that the olivine is richer in FeO \n\nthan it would be observed if this mineral was in equilibrium with a liquid whose \n\ncomposition is equivalent to the whole rock analysis. These higher than expected \n\n????/??\n??????  observed in some rocks might be due to the analyzed whole rock composition \n\nnot being representative of the liquid composition from which the olivines crystallized. \n\nThis may happen if either previous crystallization of other phases such as spinel, \n\nclinopyroxene or even olivine changed the FeO/MgO of the liquid or due to an increase \n\nof MgO in the liquid by to accumulation and consequent resorption of MgO-rich \n\nolivine.  \n\nAlternatively, the whole rock composition can be biased towards more MgO-\n\nrich contents, reflecting the \u201cinput\u201d from the olivine crystals in the analysed samples, \n\n\n\n \n\n136 \n \n\nwhich would consequentially change FeO/MgO of the whole rock and assumed liquid \n\ncomposition. This can be significant in samples that show evidence for important crystal \n\naccumulation, such as the Sines gabbro. \n\nThere is also the possibility that the observed whole rock composition reflects \n\nthe mixing of magmas with different Fe/Mg ratios, but although some of the crystals are \n\nrounded, which might taken to be an indication of post crystallization reaction, the lack \n\nof reverse zoning in the olivines apparently rules out this hypothesis. \n\nThe accumulation of olivine, causing the whole rock analysis not to be \n\nrepresentative of the liquid from which the analyzed olivines precipitated seems the \n\nmost reasonable explanation for the very high ????/??\n??????  values observed for the olivines \n\nin the Sines gabbro. The presence of macroscopic layering in the outcrops where this \n\nlithology was sampled, and the textural and geochemical characteristics of these rocks \n\n(see sections 4.1.7 and 6.1.7) support their formation by accumulation processes. \n\nAs for the lower than expected ????/??\n??????  and consequent higher forsterite values \n\nobserved in the Mafra gabbro and some of the cores of crystals in the Negrais flow, they \n\nindicate that these olivines are more magnesian than expected in a rock with that Mg#. \n\nThese high ????/??\n??????  values are usually calculated for crystal cores and might be due to \n\nthe early crystallization of some olivine cores in the ascending magmas that were not \n\nimmediately separated from the liquid, which later crystallized as the Mafra gabbro and \n\nthe basalts. The hypothesis that these crystals/cores precipitated from an earlier, more \n\nprimitive magma is not supported by the absence of reverse zoning in the crystals. \n\nAccording to Roeder and Emslie (1970) it is possible to estimate the \n\ncrystallization temperature of olivines in equilibrium with the liquid, by knowing the \n\ndistribution coefficient for Mg between the olivine and the magmatic liquid (???\n??????) \n\nusing the expression: \n\n \n\n??????\n?????? =  \n\n????\n?\n\n? ?. ?? \n\n \n\nwhere T is the temperature in Kelvins. \n\n Beattie (1993) proposed a different, theorectically more precise method for the \n\ncalculation of the saturation temperature for olivine, given that it takes into account \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n \n\nseveral compositional effects. It is based on non regular solid solution models for \n\nsilicate melts, integrates several thermodynamic characteristics of the crystal-melt pair \n\nand is supposed to have an error of approximately 10\u00ba K. The equation used to \n\ndetermine the temperature values is: \n\n??? =  \n???\n\n??\n\n? +  ?? ? ??\n?? ?\n\n???\n??\n\n?\n???\n\n??\n\n? + ??????\n???? + ????. ????\n\n? + ?????????\n? ? (??)\n\n \n\n \n\nwhere ??? is the temperature of saturation of olivine in K, R is the gas constant, P the \n\npressure in Pa, ???\n??, ???\n\n??and  ???\n??the enthalpy, entropy and volumes of fusion of the \n\nM component in olivine, ????\n???? the partition coefficient between melt and olivine for \n\nMg, ?????\n?  to the molar fraction of SiO2 in the melt, ???\n\n?  the molar fraction of Network \n\nModifying cations (NM = FeO, MgO, MnO and CaO) in the melt and NF to the molar \n\nfraction of the Network Forming cations [NF = 7/2*ln(1-?????.?\n? ) + 7*ln (1- ??????\n\n? )]. \n\n ???\n?????? was calculated according to the method developed by Beattie (1993), \n\nwhich allows the determination of this value with the data relative to the melt phase \n\nalone:  \n\n???\n?????? =  \n\n??? ? ? ??\n?? ????\n\n????\n?=?\n\n? ??\n?? ????\n\n????\n?=?\n\n \n\nWhere ??? is the molar proportion of cations in the M site of olivines (0.666), ????\n???  is \n\nthe molar concentration of MgO in the liquid, and ??\n?? and ??\n\n?? are empirical constants \n\ngiven in Beattie (1993). \n\n ???\n?????? was also determined using the method devised by Beattie et al. (1991) \n\nwhere ???\n?????? = ???\n\n?????? ? ???\n?????? + ???\n\n??????, where ???\n?????? and ???\n\n?????? are empirical \n\nconstants given in Beattie et al. (1991). \n\nThe results obtained for each of the occurrences where olivine was found to be \n\nin equilibrium with the magma is summarized in table 6.1. \n\nThe calculated ???\n?????? shows good agreement between the values obtained from \n\nthe compositions of the magma and crystals and the ones computed using the equations \n\nproposed by Beattie et al. (1991), except for the MgO and Ni poorer sample, where the \n\n\n\n \n\n138 \n \n\ncalculated D is much higher than the measured one (table 6.1). The equations derived to \n\ndescribe the variation of ???\n??????  with MgO concentrations in the liquid (Hart and \n\nDavis, 1978; Mata, 1996) do not predict a decrease in this value with decreasing MgO \n\nin the liquid, and neither does the equation by Beattie et al. (1991) that relates ????\n??????  \n\nwith ???\n??????, so this low value might be an artifact caused by the low Ni contents of the \n\nanalyzed rim of olivine, whose composition is most likely not in equilibrium with the \n\nwhole rock composition that was assumed to represent the liquid phase. \n\nThe calculated temperatures correspond to olivine saturation temperatures at 1 \n\nbar and should reflect the temperature of the magma during the onset of olivine \n\ncrystallization at surface conditions. \n\nAverage temperatures calculated for the saturation temperatures of olivine vary \n\nbetween a maximum of 1278\u00ba C in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug and a minimum of 1154 \u00baC \n\nin the Negrais flow, showing lower temperatures in the extrusive lava flow than in the \n\nintrusives, as would be expected, as shown in table 6.1. \n\n \n\nTable 6.1: Average ????/??\n?????? ,  measured and calculated  ???\n\n??????

Consequently, the clinopyroxenes from the \n\nxenoliths found in samples from the Fontanelas seamount and Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill \n\nwere also analyzed. \n\nThe structural formula for the analyzed pyroxenes was calculated on a basis \n\nof 6 oxygens, with Fe2+ and Fe3+ being calculated according to Droop (1987). \n\nThey are mostly Quadrilateral Ca-Mg-Fe clinopyroxenes (fig. 6.9a, c), and only \n\na few of the crystals fall in the Ca-Na clinopyroxene field (fig. 6.9a, c), according to the \n\nclassification of Morimoto (1988).  \n\nThese Ca-Na pyroxenes correspond to aegirine-augites and are found in the \n\nMonchique nepheline syenites and as green cores in the clinopyroxenes of a \n\nlamprophyre dyke from Loul\u00e9 (C-20). \n\nOn the triangular Ferrosilite (Fs - Fe2Si2O6) \u2013 Enstatite (Es - Mg2Si2O6) \u2013 \n\nWollastonite (Wo - Ca2Si2O6) diagram (fig. 6.9b, d), most of the samples plot on the \n\naugite and diopside  fields, with only a few of the cores of the green cored \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n \n\nclinopyroxenes in the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o tephritic sill and in the lavas of the Fontanelas \n\nseamount plotting on the hedenbergite field.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.8: Backscatter electron images of clinopyroxene phenocrysts in basic porphyritic rocks: a) green \n\ncored clinopyroxene in Loul\u00e9 lamprophyre (C-20); b) green cored clinopyroxene in the Malveira da Serra \n\nsill (RM 25); c) composite green cored clinopyroxene in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug (RM 36); clinopyroxene \n\n(Clinopyroxene) phenocrysts in the Negrais flow, with oxide inclusion. \n\n \n\nSome samples show Wo > 50% and plot on the wollastonite field, but actually \n\ncorrespond to diopsides. The increase of Wo is an artifact caused by the incorporation \n\nof non Quad components (e.g. aegirine NaFe3+Si2O6) in the structure of the \n\nclinopyroxenes that formed in silica undersaturated magmas. \n\nIn general, as differentiation progresses, the samples seem to become more \n\ndepleted in Mg, evolving towards compositions more enriched the Fs and Wo \n\nmolecules, which will also incorporate other non Quad components.  \n\nThe Sintra gabbro and the more evolved Montelevar sill seem to show two \n\ndistinct kinds of clinopyroxene with contents in Wo and Fs. \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.9: a, c) Quad (Ca+Mg+Fe2+ a.p.f.u.) versus J (2*Na a.p.f.u.) diagram of Morimoto (1988) and, b,d) \n\ntriangular Ferrosilite (Fe), Enstatite (Es), Wollastonite (Wo) classification diagram the analysed \n\nclinopyroxenes in porphyritic (a,b) and granular (c,d) samples. \n\n \n\nAs was previously described in section 6.1, some samples contain \n\nclinopyroxenes with a specific type of zoning, showing a green core surrounded by a \n\ncolorless to pink mantle and rim (e.g. figs. 6.1, 6.8), as well as the more common \n\nClinopyroxenes that show a colorless to pink core, with the rims showing a more \n\nintense shade of the same color. In order to investigate the differences in the chemical \n\n\n\n \n\n142 \n \n\ncompositions of these cores, a series of profiles were made across normally zoned and \n\ngreen cored crystals. Two representative compositional profiles are pictured in fig. 6.10.  \n\nBy analyzing the compositional profiles of each of these groups of \n\nclinopyroxenes, we can observe that the crystals with normal zoning (fig. 6.10) possess \n\na core richer in MgO and Cr2O3 with the rims being progressively enriched in Al2O3, \n\nTiO2, FeO, and to a lesser degree in Na2O in relation to the core. This is the result of a \n\nprogressive depletion of the liquid in MgO and Cr2O3 due to the simultaneous \n\ncrystallization of spinel and olivine, and consequential raise in Al2O3, TiO2, FeO and \n\nNa2O. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.10: Examples profiles across clinopyroxenes with reverse (top, green cored clinopyroxene in \n\nRibeira d\u2019Ilhas plug) and normal (bottom, pink cored clinopyroxene in Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug) zonation in \n\nclinopyroxenes. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the zonation pattern is reversed in the green cored \n\nclinopyroxenes. The cores are richer in FeO and Na2O and depleted in MgO, Cr2O3, \nAl2O3 and TiO2 in relation to the mantles and rims. As the analysis progress towards the \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n \n\nrims of these crystals there is an abrupt transition in the abundances of most elements \n\nfrom the green core to the colorless to pink mantle, where the clinopyroxenes becomes \n\nmore MgO, Cr2O3, Al2O3 and TiO2 rich and FeO and Na2O poor, showing similar \n\ncompositions to the cores in the normally zoned crystals. As the rim of the mineral \n\napproaches, however, FeO, Al2O3 and TiO2 increase and MgO and Cr2O3 decrease, in \n\nthe same way to what happens in a normally zoned clinopyroxene, due to the ongoing \n\ncrystallization of spinel and olivine that causes the concentrations of these elements to \n\ndecrease in the liquid. \n\nThese green cored, reversely zoned clinopyroxenes are found in the porphyritic \n\nbasic rocks and their peculiar zonation appears to have formed when a basic, MgO and \n\nCr2O3 rich magma mixed and entrained green crystals precipitated from a more evolved, \n\nFeO and Na2O rich but MgO, Cr2O3 and TiO2 depleted liquid. This episode was \n\nresponsible for the partial resorption of the green clinopyroxenes and the growth of \n\nmore primitive, Cr2O3, MgO and TiO2 rich and Na2O, FeO poor mantles. After the \n\nhomogenization of the mixed liquid, the pyroxenes continued to grow, with the \n\ncompositions of the rims evolving towards higher TiO2, Na2O, Al2O3 and lower MgO, \n\nCr2O3 as crystallization progressed. \n\nThe simultaneous existence of these reversely zoned phenocrysts in the same \n\nsamples with normally zoned ones puts forward that mixing and hybridization processes \n\nbetween magmas in different states of evolution taking place at depth can be regarded as \n\nan important process in generating the petrological diversity observed in the basic \n\nalkaline rocks of the WIM, as it has been proposed for other intraplate alkaline \n\nprovinces (e.g. Duda and Schminke, 1985; Dobosi, 1989; Dobosi and Fodor, 1992; Ho \n\net al., 2000; Sachs and Hansteen, 2000; Pilet et al., 2002, Marchev et al., 2006). This \n\nissue will be addressed in more detail later in this section and in the summary of this \n\nchapter (6.2.6). \n\nThe compositional variations with Mg# for some major elements of in the \n\nclinopyroxenes present in basic porphyritic rocks are displayed in figs. 6.11 to 6.14. \n\nFrom the observation of fig. 6.11, it is shown that the green cores show \n\nsignificantly different compositions from the other clinopyroxenes found in the same \n\nrocks. They are systematically richer in FeO and Na2O but generally poorer in TiO2, \n\nMgO,  Cr2O3  and sometimes even in  CaO and Al2O3,  than  the normally  zoned  pink  \n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n \n\n \nFig. 6.11: Al2O3, CaO, TiO2, FeO\n\nt, Na2O, Cr2O3 content variation with Mg# in the clinopyroxenes present \n\nas phenocrysts and matrix phases in porphyritic basic rocks. \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 6.12: Al2O3, CaO, TiO2, FeO\nt, Na2O, Cr2O3 content variation with Mg# in the clinopyroxenes present \n\nas inclusions in phenocrysts, occurring as in aggregates and amigdulae or showing inclusions of olivine or \n\nabundant Fe-Ti oxides. \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n \n\n \nFig. 6.13 Al2O3, CaO, TiO2, FeO\n\nt, Na2O, Cr2O3 content variation with Mg# in the clinopyroxenes present \n\nin uncontaminated intrusive rocks and in the xenoliths. \n\n\n\n \n\n147 \n \n\nclinopyroxenes that occur as phenocrysts and matrix phases in the same rocks. \n\nHowever, and confirming the conclusions drawn from the compositional profiles across \n\ngreen cored crystals, the rims of the green cored crystals show similar compositions to \n\nthe cores and rims of the normally zoned pink clinopyroxene and matrix crystals, \n\nsuggesting that these rims crystallized from a magma similar to the one from which the \n\nremaining phenocrysts formed, while the cores originated from a liquid with a different, \n\nmore evolved composition.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.14: Al2O3, CaO, TiO2 and Na2O, content variation with Mg# in the clinopyroxenes present in the \n\nalkaline basic intrusive rocks of the WIM. \n\n \n\nThe crystals present in the basic porphyritic rocks as inclusions in phenocrysts, \n\noccurring in aggregates and amigdulae or showing inclusions of olivine or abundant Fe-\n\nTi oxides show are represented separately since it is possible that these many types of \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n \n\noccurrence could present significant differences in elemental abundances. Nonetheless, \n\nthey show compositional ranges identical to the normally zoned clinopyroxenes, \n\nsuggesting similar crystallization conditions for these phases (fig. 6.12). The higher \n\nMg#, Cr2O3 and lower FeOt and TiO2 shown by the clinopyroxenes with olivine \n\ninclusions, as well as by the ones that occur as aggregates, can indicate that these \n\nrepresent earlier crystallization products from the same or a similar liquid. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.15: content variations of Al2O3 TiO2 and Na2O with Mg#, and of Al2O3 with FeO\n\nt in the \n\nclinopyroxenes present in the xenoliths, Monchique nepheline syenites and in the green cores of reversely \n\nzoned clinopyroxenes occurring in basic porphyritic rocks. \n\n \n\nThe clinopyroxenes found in the uncontaminated intrusive granular lithologies \n\n(Mafra, Sintra, Sines and Monchique gabbros, Monchique nepheline syenites and \n\nxenoliths) show a narrower compositional range (figs. 6.9 and 6.13) than those found in \n\nthe basic porphyritic rocks. Some of these, such as in the case of the Mafra, Monchique \n\nand Sines gabbros, show compositional affinities with the diopsides and Ti-augites \n\n\n\n \n\n149 \n \n\nobserved in the porphyritic basaltic rocks, hinting that they might have crystallized from \n\na similar parental liquid (fig 6.14). The Sintra gabbros, however, show clinopyroxenes \n\nthat are more depleted in TiO2 and in some cases CaO than the ones found in the basic \n\nrocks from the LVC and in the remaining intrusive complexes. \n\nOn the other hand, the more FeO rich, green colored clinopyroxenes in the \n\nxenoliths and nepheline syenites from Monchique seem to show some affinities with the \n\ngreen clinopyroxene cores found in the basic porphyritic rocks (figs. 6.13 and 6.15). \n\nHowever, the aegirine-augites from the Monchique nepheline syenites tend to be more \n\nenriched in Na2O, at certain Mg#, and show lower TiO2, CaO and Al2O3 concentrations \n\nthan the green cores in basic porphyritic rocks (fig. 6.15), arguing that the green cores \n\nfound in the basic porphyritic rocks in the WIM did not form in a similar nepheline \n\nsyenite magma at upper crustal pressure and temperature conditions. \n\nThe clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths show more diverse compositions than those \n\nin the nepheline syenites, but are similar to the crystals observed in some of the green \n\ncores (fig. 6.15), hinting for a similar origin for the cores in the reversely zoned \n\nclinopyroxenes and the clinopyroxenite and hornblendite xenoliths that are present in \n\nthe same outcrops at times (e.g. Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug, Eiras dos Fai\u00e3o sill, Fontanelas \n\nseamount). However, not all of the green cores in reversely zoned clinopyroxenes are \n\nsimilar in composition to the clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths, namely the more CaO, \n\nAl2O3 and TiO2 depleted and Na2O, FeO rich, which probably formed from a more \n\nevolved melt. \n\nIf the clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths and in the green cores are in fact related, \n\nthis implies that the green cores precipitated at depth from a magma, which also \n\ngenerated the xenoliths by crystallization and accumulation processes. The green cores \n\nand xenoliths must have been remobilized and mixed with an ascending, more primitive \n\nbasaltic liquid where their partial resorption and the formation of their more primitive \n\nclinopyroxene rims took place.  \n\nThe contaminated Montelevar and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sills and one of the dykes in \n\nCascais dyke show clinopyroxene compositions that reflect the degree of evolution of \n\nthe rocks that contain them (fig. 6.16). The Cascais dyke is a hawaiite and thus is less \n\nevolved than the rocks that constitute both of the sills (mostly mugearitic to benmoreitic \n\ncompositions) and its clinopyroxenes show compositions similar to the normally zoned \n\nclinopyroxenes present in the basic porphyritic rocks of the LVC (fig. 6.16). \n\n\n\n \n\n150 \n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.16: Al2O3, CaO, TiO2, FeO\n\nt, Na2O, Cr2O3 content variation with Mg# in the clinopyroxenes present \n\nin the contaminated Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas and Montelevar sills and Cascais dyke (sample RM 90). \n\n\n\n \n\n151 \n \n\nThe clinopyroxenes in the more evolved and Si-rich Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas and \n\nMontelevar sills are poorer in MgO, TiO2, Cr2O3 and Al2O3, but richer in SiO2 and FeOt \n\n(fig. 6.16). \n\nThe intermediate Montelevar sill seems to show two different clinopyroxene \n\npopulations, with distinct contents in FeOt, Al2O3 and TiO2 (fig. 6.16).  \n\nThe clinopyroxenes from these sills, although showing similar contents in some \n\nelements, do not show the same optical and chemical characteristics as the \n\nclinopyroxenes found in the green cores and therefore these cores cannot have \n\ncrystallized from similar intermediate, contaminated liquids in upper crustal pressure \n\nand temperature conditions. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.17: Al vs. Mg (a.p.f.u.) contents for the several types of clinopyroxenes from the Monchique \n\nnepheline syenites, the xenoliths and the porphyritic basic rocks. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n152 \n \n\nIt is clear from figure 6.17, that the green cores in the reversely zoned \n\nclinopyroxenes are clearly distinct in terms of Mg and Al composition from their rims, \n\nfrom the other clinopyroxenes (mostly Clinopyroxenes) that occur in the same basic \n\nporphyritic rocks and from the green clinopyroxenes from the Monchique nepheline \n\nsyenites. They do, however, show some affinities with the ones found in the xenoliths, \n\nagain suggesting a common origin for these cores and the clinopyroxenes in the \n\nxenoliths. \n\nThese green clinopyroxene cores and the clinopyroxenes found in the xenoliths \n\nmust have therefore formed from a more evolved, Mg depleted liquid, but that was \n\nenriched in Na2O and FeO. This liquid is not compatible with the basanitic liquid that \n\nhosts the reversely zoned clinopyroxenes and from which their Clinopyroxene rims and \n\nthe other clinopyroxenes crystallized, neither with the nepheline syenite where the green \n\nclinopyroxenes from Monchique formed, so it should have had some intermediate \n\ncomposition between these two extremes. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.18: Aliv vs. Alvi (a.p.f.u.) contents for the clinopyroxenes from the porphyritic basic rocks (a) and \n\nfrom the granular intrusives (b). Pressure fields from Aoki and Shiba (1973). \n\n \n\nClinopyroxenes with higher amounts of Al (a.p.f.u. - atoms per formula unit) in \n\noctahedral coordination (Alvi), and therefore higher Alvi/Aliv ratios (> 0.25), are formed \n\n\n\n \n\n153 \n \n\nat higher pressures, where more jadeitic molecule (NaAlSi2O6) is incorporated into the \n\nclinopyroxenes (Aoki and Shiba 1973; Wass, 1979).  \n\nAs can be seen of fig. 6.18a, the samples showing higher amounts of Alvi are the \n\ngreen cores and the pyroxene with olivine inclusions. In the case of the clinopyroxenes \n\nwith olivine inclusions, it is likely that they crystallized at higher depths, at an early \n\nstage in the magma crystallization history, and shortly after the olivine they involve, and \n\nwere later brought to shallower depths.  \n\nAs for the green cored clinopyroxenes, the fact that the most of them plot in the \n\nhigh pressure field comes to reinforce the possibility of their derivation from \n\ncrystallization in a deeper conduit or chamber. Also, the majority of the analysis in rims \n\nand mantles plots well into the low pressure field, as a result of their more superficial \n\norigin. This indicates that the more evolved green cores crystallized at higher depths \n\nthan their more primitive rims. \n\nIntrusive granular rocks plot mostly in the low pressure field (fig. 6.18b), as \n\nexpected due to their relatively shallow intrusion depth.  \n\nSome of the clinopyroxenes from the more evolved Montelevar and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas \n\nsills, Monchique syenites and a few samples from the Sintra gabbro plot in the high \n\npressure field, but this is likely to be a consequence of their higher SiO2 content which \n\nmeans that most of the Al present in their structure will be in octahedral coordination \n\n(Alvi) since most of the tetrahedral positions will be occupied by Si, which will \n\nconsequently generate higher Alvi/Aliv ratios.   \n\nSeveral clinopyroxenes from the xenoliths also plot in the higher P field which is \n\nanother indication of crystallization at higher pressures, as was the case with the green \n\ncored clinopyroxenes. \n\nThe positive correlation for Ti and Aliv (a.p.f.u.) is an indicator of the importance \n\nof the (Mg, Fe2+) M1 + 2SiT ? TiM1 + 2AlT (Ti-Tschermakite) substitutions in the \n\nevolution of the series (fig. 6.19). This substitution is common in the more SiO2 \n\nundersaturated magmas given that the crystallizing clinopyroxenes incorporate more Ti \n\nand Al in order to compensate for the lower Si contents.  \n\nThe matrix crystals, normally zoned phenocrysts and the rims of the green cored \n\nclinopyroxenes present in basic porphyritic rocks show Aliv/Ti ratios of approximately 3 \n\n(fig. 6.19d), as do most of the gabbroic rocks in the intrusive complexes. The green \n\ncores and the clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths, as well as the Monchique nepheline \n\n\n\n \n\n154 \n \n\nsyenite show a different evolution trend, characterized by values closer to 4 for this \n\nsame ratio (fig. 6.19d), since they contain less Ti. \n\nThe more evolved magmas, such as the ones represented by the Montelevar sill \n\nand Monchique nepheline syenite (fig. 6.19b), crystallized clinopyroxenes with higher \n\nAliv/Ti contents, similar to those shown by some of the green cores on clinopyroxenes in \n\nbasic porphyritic rocks and by some of the pyroxenes in xenoliths as well, although the \n\nlatter can show both higher Ti and Al contents. \n \n\n \nFig. 6.19: Variation of the amounts of Ti with Aliv (a.p.f.u.) for all the analyzed samples: a) all \n\nclinopyroxenes present in basic porphyritic rocks; b) all clinopyroxenes in granular intrusive rocks; c) \n\ngreen cores of reversely zoned clinopyroxenes, pyroxenes in the Monchique nepheline syenite and \n\nxenoliths; d) normally zoned clinopyroxenes and rims and mantles of the reversely zoned clinopyroxenes \n\nin the basic porphyritic rocks. \n\n\n\n \n\n155 \n \n\nLower Al/Ti ratios have also been related to high pressure crystallization \n\nconditions (Thompson, 1974). Given this, the lower Al/Ti in the green cores compared \n\nwith their rims points (fig. 6.19c,d) towards the existence of two separate phases of \n\nmineral formation: an initial crystallization phase at high pressure, when the cores \n\nformed, and a second one at lower pressure during which the more primitive rims and \n\nmantles formed, which is in agreement with the information obtained from the Aliv vs \n\nAlvi diagram. Magma mixing and high pressure crystallization will be discussed in \n\nfurther detail in section 6.2.6, integrating data from other mineral phases present in \n\nthese rocks. \n\nGiven that the Aliv/Ti ratio is almost always higher than 2 (fig. 6.19), other kind \n\nof substitutions must take place in the clinopyroxenes in order to maintain the charge \n\nbalance. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.20: Variation of the amounts of Fe3++Alvi +Na with Aliv (a.p.f.u.) for all the analyzed samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n156 \n \n\nAs can be seen on fig. 6.20, the analyzed clinopyroxenes show relatively high \n\nvalues of trivalent ions Al3+vi, Fe3+ (a.p.f.u.), and also of monovalent ions such as Na+, \n\nto compensate for the charge deficiency caused by the incorporation of Al3+ in the \n\ntetrahedral position, illustrating the importance of the CaM2 + (Mg, Fe2+)M1 + SiT ? \n\n2NaM2 + (Fe3+, Al)M1 + AlT substitutions, especially in the green cores, Monchique \n\nnepheline syenites and xenoliths, which also show the lower Aliv/Ti ratios.  \n\nAn effort was made to use the structural single pyroxene geobarometer \n\ndeveloped by Nimis (1995, 1999) to try and quantify any possible differences in the \n\ncrystallization depth of the different types of clinopyroxene cores, but the results \n\nyielded mostly negative pressure values, even in the clinopyroxenes that plot in the high \n\npressure field of Wass (1979). \n\nThis may be due to the construction of this geobarometer being based on \n\nchanges of unit cell and M1 volumes with pressure, which means that it can be error \n\nprone in crystals with high Fe3+/Fe2+ values, as is the case in some of the green cores. \n\nHigh Fe3+ can lead to a change in the distribution of Fe2+ between the M1 and M2 sites \n\nand of Fe3+ in M1. This causes a change in the M1\u2013O and M2\u2013O bond lengths, and thus \n\na change in the site volumes that is independent from pressure (Bindi et al., 1999). Also, \n\nthe presence of water in the magma and later low pressure reequilibration of the green \n\ncores and xenoliths with the magma might have led to the lower than expected pressure \n\nvalues that are often equivalent to the ones obtained for the matrix crystals. \n\nAnother possible cause for the absence of results using the Nimis (1995, 1999) \n\ngeobarometer is the inability to obtain an accurate, independent estimate for the \n\ncrystallization temperature of the clinopyroxenes, since this is a temperature dependent \n\ngeobarometer.  \n\n  \n\n6.2.3 Plagioclase, feldspars and feldpathoids \n\n \nThe analyzed rocks contain, besides the expected plagioclase and feldspars, \n\nseveral types of feldspathoids like nepheline and analcime. Nepheline is present as a \n\nmatrix phase in one of the lamprophyric dykes of Loul\u00e9 (C-20) and as a major \n\nconstituent of the Monchique nepheline syenites, while analcime was found as a matrix \n\nconstituent in the basic Lomba dos Pianos and Malveira da Serra sills, in the Mafra \n\n\n\n \n\n157 \n \n\ngabbro, the intermediate phono-tephritic Eiras do Fai\u00e3o and in the evolved Monchique \n\nnepheline syenites. \n\nThe structural formula for the analyzed plagioclase and feldspars was \n\ncalculated in a 32 oxygens basis.  \n\nAs for the feldspars and plagioclases, they can be classified and described \n\naccording to the abundances of each of the terms of the three end member solid solution \n\nthey form between anorthite (An - CaAl2Si2O8) and albite (Ab - NaAlSi3O8) and \n\northoclase (Or \u2013 KAlSi3O8).  \n\nAccording to the high temperature feldspar nomenclature (e.g. Deer et al., 1966), \n\nthey can be classified as either anorthite (An100-90), bitownite (An90-70), labradorite \n\n(An70-50), andesine (An50-30), oligoclase (An30-10), albite (Ab100-90), anorthoclase (Ab90-60, \nOr<40), sanidine or microcline/orthoclase (Or40-100), (if they crystallize at higher \n\ntemperatures in volcanic rocks the term sanidine is used, while the terms microcline/ \n\northoclase are employed for lower temperature crystallization in intrusive rocks). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.21: Backscatter electron image of a rare plagioclase phenocryst surrounded by a matrix of \n\nclinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and plagioclase on a sample from the Monte Serves neck of the LVC. \n\n \n\nOn the basaltic rocks, the cores in the rare plagioclase phenocrysts vary mostly \n\nbetween bitownite and labradorite (An74-50), with their rims showing compositions \n\nwithin the same range. The matrix phases are mostly labradorite to andesine (An55-38) in \n\nthe Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug and show a range from labradorite to oligoclase (An67-23) in the \n\nbasalts of the LVC. \n\nThe basic Lomba dos Pianos sill seems to possess two different populations of \n\nphenocrysts with cores with An75-65 and An46-52. The rims of these phenocrysts cover a \n\n\n\n \n\n158 \n \n\nwide compositional range, from bitownites to oligoclase (An73-29) with one the \n\nphenocrysts actually being rimmed by anorthoclase (An5Ab57Or39). The population with \n\nlower An contents might have a xenocrystic origin, since the minerals in the matrix \n\nshows higher anorthite contents (An68-63) than these labradorite-andesine cores. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 6.22: Anorthite-albite-orthoclase (An-Ab-Or) ternary diagram showing the variability exhibited \n\nby plagioclase and feldspar crystals in the basaltic (in the front) and granular (in the background) \n\nrocks of Late Cretaceous age. \n\n \n\nThe hawaiite that forms the Cascais dyke (sample RM 90) also seems to have \n\ntwo different phenocryst populations, one with An contents between An87-82 and the \n\nother between An68-52, with the rims showing a wider range of compositions (An79-37), \n\nwhile the matrix crystals show compositions with a more reduced An62-56 range. This \n\n\n\n \n\n159 \n \n\ndyke also shows the more An rich plagioclases in the entire dataset, despite being more \n\nevolved than the basaltic rocks gabbros. \n\nThe matrix crystals within the basic Malveira da Serra sill and Loul\u00e9 dykes, both \n\nof which show lamprophyric affinities, range in composition from labradorite to \n\noligoclase (An69-23).  Rare albite (Ab99-94) was also identified as a matrix phase. \n\nSanidine is also present in the matrix of Loul\u00e9 lamprophyre C-20 (Or92-82).  \n\nThe crystals that occur in amygdulae in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug are andesines \n\n(An46-31), with compositions similar to the matrix crystals.  \n\nThe plagioclases that form in the reaction rims of brown amphiboles in the \n\nbasaltic liquid are more sodic, classifying either as andesines (An44Ab54) or \n\nanorthoclases (An3Ab86-82Or14-11). \n\nThe phono-tephritic Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill shows only alkaline feldspars \n\n(anorthoclase and microcline) in the matrix (Ab68-42Or55-30), while the mugearitic \n\nMontelevar sill shows mostly plagioclase (andesine to labradorite) cores (An65-40), \n\nwhich can have either andesine to labradorite (An54-46) or alkaline feldspar (Ab58-36Or63-\n\n32 sanidine and anorthoclase) rims.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.23: Compositional profile across a plagioclase crystal with oscillatory zoning from the \n\nMontelevar sill. \n\n \n\nSome of the plagioclase crystals in the Montelevar sill show oscillatory zoning, \n\nwith alternating bands of more An enriched with more Ab rich layers (fig. 6.23). This \n\n\n\n \n\n160 \n \n\ntype of zoning can be produced by convection of a plagioclase crystal in a stratified \n\nmagma chamber where the more evolved an more basic melts are located in different \n\nlevels of the chamber, or reflect the injections of pulses of hotter, more mafic magma \n\ninto a chamber of intermediate composition (e.g. Ginibre et al., 2002 and references \n\ntherein). Alternatively, decompression crystallization in the sill can release latent heat \n\nwhich would then heat the magma and increase the An contents of plagioclase (Blundy \n\net al., 2006). \n\nThe intermediate Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill shows crystals with cores whose compositions \n\nvary mainly between labradorite and rarer bitownite (An72-51). Also present are rare \n\nanorthoclase cores (An18 Ab59 Or23).  The rims of these crystals vary between \n\nlabradoritic (An58-54) and andesinic (An29-20) and from anorthoclase (An15-3 Ab72-63 Or33-\n\n14) to orthoclase/microcline (Or48 Ab50) compositions. \n\nThe crystals from the Sintra gabbro have oligoclase (An27-23), and andesine-\n\nlabradorite-bitownite (An72-47) cores, with their rims covering the same compositional \n\nspectrum (An70-20). \n\nIn the Sines gabbros, the cores of the plagioclases range from bitownites to \n\nlabradorites (An82-50), while their rims are labradoritic to slightly andesinic (An64-48). On \n\nthe gabbroic rocks present in Monchique, both sodic (An7-1Ab97-89 albite and oligoclase) \n\nand more calcic (An51-47 andesine-labradorite) plagioclase cores and rims were \n\nidentified. In the Monchique nepheline syenites, however, all of the analysed crystal \n\ncores and rims are K rich feldspars (Or77-41). \n\nIn the Mafra gabbro the larger plagioclase crystals show compositions ranging \n\nfrom bitownite to andesine (An78-45), while the smaller \u201cmatrix\u201d crystals are more Na-\n\nrich andesines (An50-34) or even potassic feldspar (Or94).  \n\nThe amount of anorthite (An) in plagioclase is related with the temperature of \n\nthe magmatic system (e.g. Blundy and Wood, 1991, Bindeman et al., 1998). Also, the \n\ndistribution coefficient D for a certain element in plagioclases with compositions within \n\nthe An40-80 range is very dependent on both their An content and the crystallization \n\ntemperature of the plagioclase, according to the expression below, proposed by Blundy \n\nand Wood (1991), Bindeman et al. (1998): \n\n \n\n????(?) = ? ? ?? + ? \n \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n \n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 JK-1mol-1), T the temperature in K, An the molar \n\nanortite content \u2018X\u2019 is the slope and \u2018Y\u2019 the intercept in an RT ln(D) vs. An plot. \n\nSo as the An content in plagioclase is controlled by temperature and liquid \n\ncomposition (e.g. Blundy and Wood, 1991, Bindeman et al., 1998), and is well \n\ncorrelated against the MgO content of the melt (B\u00e9dard, 2006), by knowing the An \n\ncontent of plagioclase crystals, it is possible to estimate the MgO content of the liquid \n\ncontemporary to crystallization, and afterwards estimate the temperature of the melt in a \n\nplagioclase saturated system using the following expressions (B\u00e9dard, 2006): \n\n \n\n?? =   ? ? ??? +  ?  (for dry melts) \n\n \n\n?? =  ? ? ?? (???) +  ?  (for hydrous melts) \n\n \n\n? =  \n?? ???\n\n(? ? ??(???) +  ?)\n \n\n \n\nWith An being the molar anorthite content, MgO being the melt\u2019s MgO content (in wt \n\n%) and T the temperature in \u00baC. X and Y are the slope and the Y axis intercept, \n\nrespectively, of the fitting line for the regression of the interrelation of plagioclase An-\n\ncontent, melt composition and temperature, for wet and dry systems. X and Y vary \n\naccording to the table below (B\u00e9dard, 2006). \n\n \nTable 6.3: values for the X and Y parameters to use in the equations of B\u00e9dard (2006). \n\nfor dry melts: X X std-error Y Y std-error \n\nMgO &lt;1% (Tmin) 0.50206 0.09061 0.1009 0.10362 \nMgO > 1% 0.04448 0.00158 0.42132 0.07065 \n\nfor wet melts (Tmax) 0.10639 0.00444 0.57229 0.13285 \n\n \n\nAfter the melt\u2019s MgO content is estimated, it is possible to calculate the \n\ntemperature of crystallization of the plagioclase crystals. \n\nThe temperatures obtained by this method in several of the analyzed rocks are \n\ndisplayed in table 6.4. \n\nThe highest average temperatures were obtained for the crystals with the \n\nhigher An contents present as phenocrysts in the Lomba dos Pianos sill and Cascais \n\n\n\n \n\n162 \n \n\ndyke, as well as in the cores of the crystals of the Mafra and Sines gabbro (1091, \n\n1266, 1118 and 1068 \u00baC, respectively) reflecting higher crystallization temperatures \n\nfor plagioclase in these magmas.  \n\nAll of the analyzed matrix crystals reflect lower crystallization temperatures \n\n(880-1043\u00baC), as expected, since they correspond to the latest crystallizing phases \n\nin these rocks and probably formed during rapid cooling events. \n\n \n\nTable 6.4: Temperatures obtained for the plagioclase crystals in the studied samples using the method \n\nproposed

sill, Monchique, Sines and Sintra gabbros and \n\nthe rims of the other intrusive rocks, all show crystallization temperatures around \n\n900\u00baC, reflecting their crystallization in slowly cooling intrusive environments, \n\nwhich allowed for growth to take place at lower temperatures. \n\nThe temperatures obtained for the phenocrysts cores II of the Lomba dos \n\nPianos sill and Cascais dykes are lower (911 and 1000\u00baC) than the ones obtained for \n\nthe rims, type I phenocrysts and even matrix crystals (1043 and 1013\u00baC), \n\nreinforcing the idea that these might be xenocrysts incorporated into the magma or \n\nhave resulted from the mixing of a more evolved, cooler magma, with a hotter and \n\nmore primitive melt.  \n\nThe existence of crystal cores with different An contents, and the consequent  \n\nvariation in crystallization temperatures obtained in the plagioclases of the Sintra \n\ngabbro, however, might be caused by different processes, such as secondary \n\ncrystallization of more albite rich plagioclase during hydrothermal alteration, or the \n\nabsence of the sampling of all the intermediate plagioclase compositions during \n\nanalysis. \n\nAs for

\n\n6.24a) zoned phenocrysts rocks or more rarely as matrix components in basic \n\nporphyritic rocks. They are often a major constituent of gabbroic rocks, where they \n\npoikilitically involve the other mineral phases. They are also a major component in \n\nthe xenoliths and can be found as large xenocrysts in basaltic plugs and flows, often \n\nshowing signs of destabilization and dehydration (fig. 6.24b).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.24: Backscatter electron image of amphibole phenocrysts. a) amphibole phenocrysts showing \n\nreverse zoning in the Malveira da Serra sill (RM 25); b) amphibole xenocryst showing a reaction rim of \n\nclinopyroxene and several oxide and sulphide inclusions on the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug (RM 36). \n\n \n\nThe structural formula for the analyzed amphiboles was calculated on an \n\nanhydrous base, with 13 cations, including Ca, K and Na.  \n\nThese minerals are relatively homogenous in terms of composition and \n\nclassify as calcic amphiboles (hornblendes, s.l.), namely pargasites and more \n\nfrequently as kaersutites (Leake, 1997; fig 6.25).  \n\nThe pargasites occur in many of the analyzed types, such as crystals in the \n\nSintra gabbro, the cores in the phenocrysts in the basic Malveira da Serra sill and \n\nFontanelas seamount lavas, but also as xenocrysts reacting with the host magma in \n\nthe Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas basaltic (s.l.) plug. \n\n\n\n \n\n165 \n \n\nTwo green amphiboles formed by late hydrothermal alteration from the \n\nSintra gabbro classify as magnesio-hornblendes (Na+K &lt;0.5) and are clearly not \n\nrelated to the remaining analyzed suite (fig. 6.25). \n\nAlso noticeable in fig. 6.25 is that amphiboles from the Sintra gabbro seem \n\nto show systematically lower contents in Ca and Na+K and higher Si and Fe \n\n(a.p.f.u.) that the remaining analyzed amphiboles. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.25: Amphibole classification diagrams according to Leake et al. (1997). \n\n \n\nAmphiboles in the other gabbros show relatively homogenous compositions \n\nwithin each gabbro, with the ones in the Mafra and Monchique gabbro being more \n\nevolved, rich in K2O, TiO2, FeO and MnO and poorer in MgO and Na2O than the \n\namphiboles in the Sines gabbro. By comparison, amphiboles from the Sintra gabbro  \n\n\n\n \n\n166 \n \n\n \nFig. 6.26: K2O, Al2O3, TiO2, MnO, SiO2 content variation with Mg# in the amphiboles present in the \n\nintrusive rocks. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n167 \n \n\nshow systematically lower contents in CaO, Al2O3 and K2O and higher SiO2 and \n\nFeO than the remaining analyzed amphiboles, thus they appear to have formed from \n\na different, more evolved magma, enriched in SiO2 and FeO but with less abundant \n\nalkali and TiO2 contents. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 6.27: Representative compositional profiles across reversely zoned (A and B) amphiboles from the \n\nMalveira da Serra sill (RM 25). \n\n \n\nThe differences in amphibole composition between gabbros do not mirror \n\nthe differences in the abundance of the same elements in the whole rock \n\ngeochemistry of these rocks, so they should reflect either late crystallization and \n\ngrowth, possibly from a residual intercumulus liquid, or accumulation of crystals \n\nforming from an evolving melt within a magma chamber. These hypotheses would \n\nrender the composition of the whole rock analysis unrepresentative of the liquid \n\nfrom which the amphiboles formed. \n\n\n\n \n\n168 \n \n\nTwo types of cores can be identified in the amphiboles from the Malveira da \n\nSerra sill (figs. 6.26 and 6.27). One is more FeO, Na2O, Al2O3 and MnO rich, but \n\nMgO, TiO2 and K2O poor than the other.  \n\nThe more MgO rich cores correspond to normally zoned amphibole \n\nphenocrysts while the MgO poor cores belong to reversely zoned amphiboles as can \n\nbe observed in the profiles shown in fig. 6.27. Reversely zoned clinopyroxenes \n\nwere also identified in this sill (see 6.2.3 in this section). \n\nIn the normally zoned crystals, the rims show lower MgO, but are enriched \n\nin TiO2, K2O, FeO and Na2O relative to the core, a trend also observed in \n\nclinopyroxenes and compatible with the progressive crystallization and removal of \n\nolivine.  \n\nIn the reversely zoned crystals, the rim first shows a lighter brown color and \n\na more MgO, and TiO2 rich and Al2O3, MnO and FeO depleted composition. As one \n\nprogresses towards the dark brown core, there is an abrupt change to lower MgO \n\nand TiO2 values and higher FeO, MnO and Al2O3 contents (fig. 6.27), concurrent \n\nwith the normal evolution trends shown by a basic magma experiencing fractional \n\ncrystallization.   \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.28: K2O, Al2O3, TiO2, MnO, SiO2 content variation with Mg# in the amphiboles present in the \n\nintrusive rocks. \n\n\n\n \n\n169 \n \n\nThe reverse zonation seen on some of the amphiboles from the Malveira da \n\nSerra sill, together with the same kind of zonation observed in clinopyroxenes in \n\nthis and other intrusions, argues again for the existence of magma mixing and \n\nhomogenization between a more evolved and a more primitive liquid at depth, prior \n\nto the installation of this sill. \n\nAmphiboles from the Fontanelas seamount show compositions similar to the \n\nones found in other porphyritic basic rocks. \n\nThe xenocrysts that reacted with the basaltic melt and developing reaction \n\nrims of clinopyroxene, oxides and sometimes plagioclase (see fig. 6.1 and section \n\n6.1 for more details) show compositions similar to the rims and cores of the \n\nnormally zoned phenocrysts in the Malveira da Serra sill. This sill corresponds to \n\nan intrusive basic rock where amphibole appears to be stable, but where it also \n\nshows evidence for the existence magma mixing previous to installation at upper \n\ncrustal depths. This suggests that the development of the reaction rims in \n\namphiboles discussed in section 6.1.12 might be attributed to decompression and \n\ndehydration of the amphiboles, associated to the devolatilization of the magma, \n\nrather than to magma mixing.  \n\nThe amphibole xenocrysts show small differences in composition among \n\nthemselves, namely in terms of K2O and MgO contents. The retrograding \n\namphiboles in the Lomba dos Pianos sill show the lowest MgO and K2O values, and \n\nthe ones in the Negrais flow have the highest MgO and K2O contents, while the \n\ncrystals in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug have intermediate compositions between these \n\ntwo. These heterogeneities are probably a result of the crystallization of these \n\nminerals from magmas with slightly different compositions and degrees of \n\nevolution. \n\nThe xenoliths show amphiboles with a range of compositions that overlap \n\neither the gabbros or the cores of reversely zoned amphiboles from the Malveira da \n\nSerra sill, implying formation from a liquid with similar characteristics. \n\nThe more common types of substitutions in these rocks seem to be simple \n\nMg for Fe2+ and Ti for Mg or Fe2+ in the octahedral position (fig. 6.28) and also Al \n\nfor Si in the tetrahedral position if Ti is incorportated in M1, indicating important \n\ncoupled Ti-tschermakite substitution ((Mg, Fe2+) M1 + 2SiT ?

Since this geothermometer is pressure dependent and no pressure \n\nestimate is available for the crystallization of these amphiboles, the temperatures \n\nwere calculated using pressures of 1, 2, 5 and 10 kbar. The expression that yields \n\nthe equilibrium temperature between amphibole and plagioclase is: \n\n \n\n? =  \n7.78 +  ?????? ?  33.6????4 \u2013 (66.8 ? 2.92?)  ?  ???\n\n?2  + 78.5???\n?1 +  9.4????\n\n0.0721 ? ? ? ln ?\n27 ?  ???\n\n?4 ? ???\n?1 ? ???\n\n????\n\n64 ?  ???\n?4 ? ???\n\n?1 ? ???\n?????  \n\n \n\n  \n\nwhere T is the temperature in Kelvin, P is the pressure in kbar, the ??\n? terms \n\nrepresent the molar fraction of a species (or component) i in phase (or \n\ncrystallographic site) n, and Yab-an = 3 kJ if Xab > 0.5, or Yab-an = 12*(2Xab-1)+3 kJ if \n\nXab &lt;0.5. \n\n \n\nTable 6.6: Temperatures obtained for the amphibole-plagioclase pair using the Holland and Blundy \n\n(1994) geothermometer. \n\n    P= 1 kbar P= 2 kbar P= 5 kbar P= 10 kbar \n\nOccurrence Sample type of amphibole  type  of plagioclase T \u00b0 C T \u00b0 C T \u00b0 C T \u00b0 C \n\nLomba dos \nPianos sill \n\nRM 9 reacting \namphiboles \n\nAn rich plagioclase \nphenocrysts \n\n1000.0 1001.8 1007.1 1015.9 \n\nRibeira \nd'Ilhas plug \n\nRM 36  rim of reacting \namphiboles \n\nmatrix crystals 900.6 904.0 914.0 930.8 \n\nRibeira \nd'Ilhas plug \n\nRM 36  crystals in \namigdulae \n\ncrystals in \namigdulae \n\n883.8 887.0 896.4 912.1 \n\nMafra gabbro RM 83  poikiltic amphibole plagioclase rims 1011.3 1011.9 1013.9 1017.3 \n\nMafra gabbro RM 83  amphibole rims matrix crystals 932.9 933.4 934.8 937.2 \n\nSines gabbro RM 101 amphiboles \nsurrounding cpx \n\nplagioclase cores 1034.3 1034.2 1033.9 1033.4 \n\nSines gabbro RM 101 amphiboles \nsurrounding cpx \n\nplagioclase rims 990.4 990.3 990.0 989.6 \n\nMonchique \ngabbro \n\nMon 84  amphibole cores plagioclase cores 997.8 998.0 998.3 998.9 \n\nMonchique \ngabbro \n\nMon 84 amphibole rims plagioclase rims 978.5 979.0 980.5 983.1 \n\nSintra gabbro RM 11 amphibole cores plagioclase cores 910.6 912.6 918.4 928.0 \n\nSintra gabbro RM 11  amphibole rims plagioclase rims 882.1 884.2 890.6 901.3 \n\nSintra gabbro RM 11 green amphiboles plagioclase rims 630.4 636.5 654.8 685.2 \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n171 \n \n\nThe results are shown in table 6.6. In the intrusive rocks, the higher \n\ntemperatures were obtained for the Sines, Mafra, and Monchique gabbros (1030-\n\n980 \u00baC at 1 kbar) and the basic Lomba dos Pianos sill (? 1000 \u00baC, assuming both \n\nthe amphiboles and plagioclase phenocrysts crystallized in equilibrium), than in the \n\nSintra gabbro (910-880 \u00baC at 1 kbar) and in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas basaltic plug (900-\n\n800 \u00baC at 1 kbar). \n\nThe amphiboles are a late phase in many of the gabbros, since they envelop \n\nmost of the other minerals present in these rocks, so these low crystallization \n\ntemperatures were expected. Even lower temperatures were obtained for the Ribeira \n\nd\u2019Ilhas plug since the amphiboles in this rock occur in amigdulae and represent the \n\ncrystallization products of the last remaining fraction of melt. \n\nThe late hydrothermal green amphiboles in the Sintra gabbro show the \n\nlowest crystallization temperatures (? 630 \u00baC), supporting the hypothesis that they \n\nformed in secondary, subsolidus conditions after the crystallization of the \n\nremaining assemblage. \n\nAmphibole geobarometry using Al in amphibole geobarometers was not \n\napplicable to these samples since they are calibrated for silica saturated magmas \n\n(e.g. Hollister et al., 1987; Johnson and Rutherford, 1989; Schmidt, 1992; Anderson \n\nand Smith, 1995) where Al incorporation in amphibole is controlled by pressure, \n\nwhile in silica undersaturated rocks such as these, the Al contents in amphibole are \n\nalso dependent in the availability of Si. \n\n \n\n6.2.5 Oxides  \n\n \nThe majority of the oxides present in basic igneous rocks are Fe-Ti oxides, along \n\nwith rare Cr spinel.  \n\nThe structural formula for the spinels (magnetite, chromite and ulvospinel) \n\nwas calculated in a 32 oxygens basis, while for the ilmenites these were calculated \n\non a 6 oxygens basis.  \n\nThe results obtained for these analyses are displayed in ternary diagrams in \n\naccordance to their TiO2, FeO and Fe2O3 abundances (fig. 6.30). Also represented are \n\nthe lines corresponding to the high temperature hematite (Fe2O3)-ilmenite(FeTiO3), and \n\n\n\n \n\n172 \n \n\nmagnetite(Fe3O4)-ulvospinel(Fe2TiO4) solid solutions defined by Buddington and \n\nLindsley (1964). \n\nMost of the analyzed samples are titanomagnetites and plot close to the line that \n\ndefines the magnetite-ulvospinel solid solution (fig. 6.30), indicating they contain \n\nsignificant amounts of Ti and variable quantities of Fe2+ and Fe3+. This high abundance \n\nof titanomagnetite and the relative scarcity of magnetite-ilmenite exsolution features in \n\nthe oxides present in the basic porphyritic rocks argue for rapid cooling of most of these \n\nmagmas. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.29: backscatter electron images of: a) crystal of ilmenite (darker) showing magnetite exsolution \n\nand rim; b) exsolution of pleonaste (black rods) and ilmenite from magnetite, in the Negrais flow (RM \n\n43). \n\n \n\nIn the studied samples, ilmenites are, in general, much rarer than Ti-magnetites \n\nand occur either as exsolution lamellae in magnetite (e.g. fig. 6.29) or more rarely as \n\nisolated crystals in the silica saturated sills (Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas and Montelevar). \n\nThe scarcity of ilmenite is a common situation in silica undersaturated rocks, \n\nsince their low silica activity (?????) favours the incorporation of Ti in clinopyroxenes, \n\nforming Clinopyroxene and inhibiting the formation of ilmenite (Verhoogen, 1962), \n\nwhose crystallization is also strongly dependent on the magma\u2019s TiO2 content (e.g. \n\nToplis and Carrol, 1995). According to Charmichael et al. (1974) and Mata and Munh\u00e1 \n\n(2004), the reactions that expresses the control of ?????and ????? over the formation of \n\nthese minerals are: \n\n2FeTiO3 + 2 CaAl2Si2O8 ? 2CaTiAl2O6 + Fe2SiO4 + 3SiO2 \n                                    ilmenite                plagioclase                          pyroxene                 olivine                 silica \n\n\n\n \n\n173 \n \n\n2FeTiO3 + Fe2SiO4 ? 2Fe2TiO4 + SiO2 \n                                                           ilmenite                olivine                      spinel                melt \n\n \n\nOn silica undersaturated melts, the reaction will progress towards the end \n\nmembers in the right. If silica is added to the system increasing ?????, then the reaction \n\nproducts will be driven to the left end member. Consequently, the presence of ilmenite \n\nin the SiO2 saturated sills is likely to be an effect of addition of silica to the system, \n\nprobably as a consequence of assimilation of SiO2 rich crustal lithologies.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.30: Ternary diagram showing the analyzed oxide samples from: a) basic porphyritic rocks; b) \ninclusions in minerals, breakdown of amphiboles in basaltic rocks and; c) from the granular intrusives. \nLines representing the high temperature (1300 \u00baC, 1 atm) magnetite-ulvospinel and hematite-ilmenite \nsolid solutions from Buddington and Lindsley (1964). \n\n \n\nChromite and chromian titanomagnetite were also identified and analyzed. They \n\noccur more frequently as inclusions in olivines, but can also be found as matrix crystals \n\nin the basaltic Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug and as one of the opaque phases present in the Mafra \n\n\n\n \n\n174 \n \n\ngabbro. Chromites have 16-35% Cr2O3, 10-18% Al2O3 and 3.5-10.4% MgO. Chromian \n\ntitanomagnetites (Cr2O3 7-13%; Al2O3 5-19%; TiO2 8-16%) are rare but can be found as \n\nmatrix crystals and phenocrysts (total of 4 analyses) in basic porphyritic rocks. \n\nIn the basic porphyritic rocks (fig. 6.30a), phenocrysts, microphenocrysts and \n\nmatrix crystals mostly plot in the magnetite-ulvospinel solid solution line, and are \n\ntherefore mainly titanomagnetites (TiO2 35-6 %). Exsolution between titanomagnetite \n\nand ilmenite was observed in some phenocrysts as can be observed in fig. 6.29. \n\nIlmenite can occur sporadically as a matrix phase in these rocks, but it is always \n\nassociated with titanomagnetite exsolution.    \n\nThe oxide inclusions present in the silicate minerals of the basic porphyritic \n\nrocks (fig. 6.30b) display compositions similar to the matrix and phenocrystic phases, \n\ncorresponding mostly to titanomagnetites (TiO2 5-24 %), but in some cases ilmenites \n\nand magnetites resulting from the exsolution of titanomagnetite were also identified.  \n\nThe types of oxide inclusions observed in silicated minerals are listed below:  \n\n\u2022 The majority of the analyzed chromian spinels (Cr2O3 7-35%; Al2O3 5-18%) \n\noccur as inclusions in olivine, but can also be found in Clinopyroxene, meaning that this \n\nwas one of the first phases to crystallize and to be removed from the melt. \n\n\u2022 Inclusions in olivines found in basalts and gabbros have mostly Cr-rich (7-35%) \n\nspinel inclusions although some titanomagnetites and magnetites can also be observed \n\nin olivines from the Sines gabbro (fig. 6.30c), that have the lowest forsterite contents of \n\nall the analyzed olivines (Fo &lt;70%). \n\n\u2022 Plagioclases have Ti-rich titanomagnetite inclusions while the ones present in \n\namphibole are more Fe3+ rich.  \n\n\u2022 The minerals found partially included in the rims of clinopyroxene crystals are \n\ntitanomagnetites and have compositions that are very similar to the oxides found in the \n\nmatrix. \n\n\u2022 Within the same reaction rim, the oxides that result from the reaction of \n\namphibole with the host magma are either ilmenites or titanomagnetites, suggesting that \n\nthe amphiboles break down to two distinct oxide phases, one accommodating mostly \n\nFeO and some TiO2 and the other contains higher amounts of both Fe2O3 and TiO2. This \n\nsuggests variable oxygen fugacity conditions during amphibole breakdown. \n\n\n\n \n\n175 \n \n\n\u2022 Green cored clinopyroxenes and the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill have the more Fe2O3 rich \n\ntitanomagnetite inclusions, with the former even showing one inclusion with Fe3+ rich \n\nilmenite. \n\nWhile the oxides present in the basic porphyritic rocks are mostly \n\ntitanomagnetites, the ones present in the gabbros can be either titanomagnetites or \n\ncrystals containing magnetite with exsolved ilmenite lamellae. These exsolved crystals \n\nare substantially more common in the intrusives (Sintra, Sines and Monchique gabbros, \n\nPa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill, fig. 6.30c), since slower cooling facilitates this process.  \n\nThe Monchique and Sines gabbros show predominantly magnetites and \n\nilmenites, indicating slow cooling conditions. \n\nThe Mafra gabbro has two different oxide phases, one with a larger size with \n\nchromium spinel cores (Cr2O3 > 30%) and titanomagnetite rims, and a smaller one \n\nmade out exclusively of titanomagnetite.  \n\nIlmenites and magnetites from the Sintra gabbro are the more Fe2O3 rich of the \n\noxides present in the gabbroic rocks, indicating equilibration with more oxidizing \n\nconditions. \n\nThe phonotephritic Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill shows more or less Ti rich \n\ntitanomagnetites (3-20%) while in the intermediate Montelevar sill the oxide phases are \n\nboth titanomagnetite and ilmenite, with the titanomagnetite (TiO2 13.6-18.1 %) \n\nsometimes exsolving from the ilmenite. The intermediate Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill shows both \n\ntitanomagnetite and ilmenite crystals, with exsolution features present in some of them. \n\nThe Monchique nepheline syenites show only magnetites and titanomagnetites \n\n(TiO2 3-20 %) and hence must have formed from a more Ti depleted liquid. \n\nThe Fe-Ti oxides present in the xenoliths (fig. 6.30c) are Fe3+ rich magnetites \n\nand titanomagnetites, which is in accordance with crystallization from a more oxidated \n\nand evolved melt. \n\nAccording to experimental work (Hill and Roeder, 1974) and empirical \n\nobservations (e.g. Mata and Munh\u00e1, 2004), the existence of spinels with a \n\ncompositional spectrum ranging from chromite to chromian titanomagnetite and \n\ntitanomagnetite in the basic porphyritic rocks suggests that crystallization took place \n\nunder relatively high oxygen fugacity (fO2) conditions, at least above the NNO (Ni-Ni \n\noxide) buffer. \n\n\n\n \n\n176 \n \n\nThese relatively high oxygen fugacity conditions detected in the earlier spinels, \n\nsuggests that the oxidizing conditions might have been inherited from a mantle source \n\nthat had been previously metasomatized by an oxidizing agent (e.g. Mata and Munh\u00e1, \n\n2004). \n\nIt is usually agreed that during magmatic evolution, the minerals from the \n\nulvospinel-magnetite solid solution should show a trend in the direction of \n\nFe3+enrichment and Ti depletion with increasing differentiation, in response to falling \n\ntemperature (e.g. Charmichael et al., 1974; Haggerty, 1976). However, in the studied \n\nbasaltic porphyritic rock this does not seem to be the case, with the later phases such as \n\nmatrix crystals, microphenocrysts and inclusions in plagioclase showing higher TiO2 \n\ncontents that earlier phases like the phenocryst cores (fig 6.30).  \n\nThis trend can be the result of the progressive decrease of the oxygen fugacity \n\nconditions with increasing differentiation (Mata, 1996). At higher fugacities the reaction \n\nbelow will form the products on the right, meaning that Fe-rich spinels will crystallize \n\nincorporating a large portion of the available Fe3+.As fO2 and temperature decrease and \n\nTiO2 concentrations in the melt increase, the Ti-rich ulvospinel molecule will enter the \n\nspinel\u2019s structure in higher amounts since there is less available Fe3+ and DTi increases \n\nwith decreasing temperatures (Mata, 1996; Mata and Munh\u00e1, 2004). \n\n \n\n3Fe2TiO4 + O2 ? 2Fe3O4 + 3TiO2 \n                                                                         ulvospinel             gas              magnetite         magma \n\n \n\nCaAl2Si2O8 + 2Fe3O4 + 2TiO2 ?

It relates to the redox conditions of the magmas, which at a fixed T \n\nare more oxidizing at higher fugacities, and more reducing at lower fugacities. The \n\nvariation of oxygen fugacity conditions with temperature can be described using redox \n\nbuffers, which correspond to assemblages of minerals or compounds that constrain \n\noxygen fugacity as a function of temperature. \n\nOxygen fugacities (expressed as log fO2) and blocking temperatures of \n\nequilibration for the rocks that showed magnetite-ilmenite pairs were calculated \n\napplying the ILMAT program by Lepage (2003) that uses the geothermobarometer of \n\n\n\n \n\n177 \n \n\nAndersen and Lindsley (1985) with the Mol % of ulvospinel and ilmenite being \n\ncalculated according to Lindsley and Spencer (1982). \n\nThe results are compiled in table 6.7 and fig. 6.31 and show log fO2 values \n\nvarying between -27.7 in the basaltic Negrais lava flow and -13.10 in the Sintra gabbro \n\nwith the accompanying blocking temperatures ranging from 500\u00baC in the Negrais flow \n\nplug to 850\u00baC in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas basaltic plug.  \n\n \nTable 6.7: oxygen fugacities and blocking temperatures obtained for the magnetite-ilmenite pairs in the \n\nstudied rocks using the ILMAT software (Lepage, 2003) and the geothermobarometer of Andersen and \nLindsley (1985) \n\nSample  Mol Ulv % Mol Ilm %  temp (\u00baC) log fO2 \nRM43 zoned phenocryst Negrais flow 55.52 98.06 565.48 -24.23 \nRM43 zoned phenocryst Negrais flow 54.28 98.64 499.63 -27.72 \nRM43 zoned phenocryst Negrais flow 54.47 97.88 581.28 -23.45 \nRM43 rim of amphibole Negrais flow 54.04 97.86 582.39 -23.39 \nRM36 rim of amphibole Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas \n\nplug \n53.55 92.85 850.44 -13.83 \n\nRM50 zoned crystal Montelevar sill 57.10 95.43 762.81 -16.57 \nRM50 zoned crystal Montelevar sill 41.62 93.25 776.46 -15.30 \nRM101 zoned crystal Sines gabbro 21.08 98.10 542.62 -25.02 \nRM101 zoned crystal Sines gabbro 15.98 97.95 546.38 -24.60 \nRM101 zoned crystal Sines gabbro 14.69 96.84 594.55 -21.59 \nRM101 zoned crystal Sines gabbro 14.69 97.65 559.94 -23.66 \nMON84 zoned crystal Monchique \n\ngabbro \n1.50 94.95 546.46 -20.45 \n\nMON84 zoned crystal Monchique \ngabbro \n\n3.39 95.01 582.09 -19.85 \n\nMON84 zoned crystal Monchique \ngabbro \n\n14.67 95.38 640.41 -19.11 \n\nRM 11 zoned crystal Sintra gabbro 12.0 83.3 768.33 -13.16 \nRM 11 zoned crystal Sintra gabbro 13.6 83.5 776.52 -13.10 \nRM 11 zoned crystal Sintra gabbro 10.8 82.9 762.31 -13.20 \nRM 11 zoned crystal Sintra gabbro 8.2 83.5 741.06 -13.52 \nRM 11 zoned crystal Sintra gabbro 9.0 83.6 746.83 -13.46 \n\n \n\nMost of the samples plot along the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) and NNO \n\nredox buffers, or below the previous. The most oxidizing conditions appear to have \n\noccurred in the Sintra gabbro, which shows higher fugacities than the NNO buffer, and \n\nto a lesser degree in the Montelevar sill and Monchique gabbro, while the more \n\nreducing conditions were recorded in the LVC and Sines gabbros.  \n\n\n\n \n\n178 \n \n\nThe more oxidizing conditions detected in the Sintra gabbro agree with the more \n\nFe2O3 rich contents of their magnetites and ilmenites and could be related to subsolidus \n\nequilibration during a secondary alteration phase in more oxidizing conditions. \n\nHowever, the high temperature of equilibrium is not in agreement with this hypothesis, \n\nsince it is ? 100\u00ba C higher than the one obtained for the crystallization of secondary \n\namphibole. \n\nBlocking temperatures for the LVC lava flows are surprisingly low, both in the \n\nphenocrysts and the matrix, indicating slow cooling in the sampled basal flow, probably \n\nas a result of covering and isolation from rapid cooling by subsequent lava flows of the \n\nLVC\u2019s lava pile.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 6.31: Log oxygen fugacity vs. temperature at 1 bar pressure for the analyzed samples and common \n\nbuffer assemblages, plotted from algorithms (Frost in  Lindsley, ed., 1991) (MH, magnetite-hematite; \n\nNNO, Nickel-nickel oxide; FMQ, fayalite-magnetite-quartz; WM, wustite-magnetite; IW, iron-wustite; \n\nQIF, quartz-iron-fayalite) \n\n\n\n \n\n179 \n \n\nEquilibrium temperatures for the formation of the magnetite-ilmenite pairs in the \n\nreaction rims of amphiboles in the Negrais flow and Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug are quite low, \n\nwith the amphiboles in the Negrais flow showing the lowest value. This may be caused \n\nby later subsolidus equilibration in the Negrais flow, or correspond to a primary feature, \n\nwith the reactions in amphibole in the Negrais flow taking place at lower temperatures \n\nthan the ones in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug. \n\nThe higher blocking temperatures for the intermediate Montelevar sill and \n\nbasaltic Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug are likely a result of faster cooling in these relatively \n\nthinner intrusives, when compared to the Sines and Monchique igneous complexes and \n\neven to the LVC\u2019s lava pile. \n\nIn general, most of the blocking temperatures are quite low, which indicates that \n\nthe formation of magnetite from ilmenite probably took place during subsolidus \n\noxidation, by exsolution of a previously existing homogenous phase (titanomagnetite), \n\nwhich is supported by the observation of trellis lamellae in many of the exsolved \n\ncrystals (e.g. fig. 6.29). \n\n \n\n6.2.6 Micas \n\n \nBrown to reddish micas are present in a small fraction of the analyzed rocks, \n\noccurring mostly as phenocrysts in one of the lamprophyric Loul\u00e9 dykes, as an \n\naccessory phase in the matrix of the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o phonotephritic sill, in the \n\nMonchique syenites and the Sintra gabbro and even more infrequently in the basaltic \n\nrocks.  \n\nThe structural formula for the analyzed micas was calculated on an \n\nanhydrous base, with 22 oxygens.  \n\nMost of the analyzed micas are Mg rich phlogopites with the exception of the \n\nmicas in the Monchique nepheline syenite, the two more Fe rich rims in one of the \n\nphenocrysts in the Loul\u00e9 lamprophyre, and one crystal in the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o \n\nphonotephrite and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sills that are classified as biotites. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n180 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 6.32: classification of the mica minerals, according to Rieder et al., (1998). \n\n \n\nThe crystals in the nepheline syenites usually form a compositionally separate \n\ngroup that is more FeO, MnO, K2O and F rich, indicating crystallization from a more \n\nevolved liquid. Meanwhile, the remaining analyzed crystals formed from more basic \n\nmagmas are enriched in MgO, TiO2, BaO and Na2O (fig. 6.33) relative to the ones \n\nfound in the nepheline syenites.  \n\nMica compositions in the studied rocks seem to show a tendency for a \n\nprogressive TiO2, Na2O, BaO and Al2O3 decrease and a K2O, and MnO increase with \n\ndecreasing Mg#, i.e. with increasing differentiation (fig. 6.33). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n181 \n \n\n \nFig. 6.33: Al2O3, TiO2, K2O, Na2O, BaO and MnO variation with Mg# for the analyzed micas. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n182 \n \n\n6.2.7 Summary and discussion \n\n \nFrom the mineral chemistry data described above, it is possible to make several \n\ninferences concerning the processes responsible for the evolution and differentiation of \n\nthe alkaline magmas of the WIM. \n\nUsing the geothermometers of Roeder and Emslie (1979) and Beattie (1993), the \n\nolivine saturation was calculated to have occurred at temperatures between 1250 and \n\n1150 \u00baC, for the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug and Negrais lava flow, respectively.  \n\nThe precipitation and removal of olivine led to the decrease of Mg and Ni and an \n\nincrease of FeOt in the residual melt, which is reflected in the crystallization sequence \n\nof the olivines.  \n\nThe decreasing amounts of CaO and MnO in the olivines with increasing Fa \n\ncontents are associated to the onset of the crystallization of clinopyroxene, plagioclase \n\nand possibly Fe-Ti oxides. \n\nThe importance of crystal accumulation processes in the genesis of some of the \n\nalkaline rocks of the WIM was reinforced by the observation that for some of the \n\nstudied samples (e.g. Sines and Mafra gabbros), their ????/??\n??????  value did not reflect \n\nequilibrium between the composition of the olivines and the rock where they were \n\nincluded. Therefore, the whole rock compositions of these occurrences cannot be \n\nconsidered as representatives of the liquids from which the olivines precipitated. \n\nIn general, the clinopyroxene compositions evolve towards terms that are more \n\nenriched in FeO and Na2O, while becoming progressively depleted in MgO. At around \n\nMg# &lt;70 the TiO2 and Al2O3 contents of clinopyroxenes start to decrease, probably due \n\nto decreasing contents in the melt caused by onset of crystallization and removal of \n\ntitanomagnetite and plagioclase. \n\nClinopyroxene phenocrysts often show reverse zoning, with the cores possibly \n\ncrystallizing at higher pressures (see fig. 6.18), suggesting the mixture between a more \n\nevolved and a more basic magma at depth, both of alkaline nature and thus possibly \n\ngenetically related (e.g. Duda and Schminke, 1985; Dobosi, 1989; Dobosi and Fodor, \n\n1992; Pilet et al., 2002). \n\nPlagioclase and feldspars predictably evolve from more An rich compositions in \n\nthe more basic rocks to more Ab and Or rich terms in the more siliceous lithologies.  \n\n\n\n \n\n183 \n \n\nThe studied plagioclases appear to have crystallized between approximately \n\n1200\u00ba C, for the terms richer in An, and 800 \u00baC, for the crystals poorer in An (see table \n\n6.4). However, it must be emphasized that the highest obtained temperatures (Tmax) are \n\nlikely to overestimate the crystallization temperatures for plagioclase since these are \n\nhigher than some of the olivine saturation temperatures and olivine is one of the first \n\ncrystallizing phases in the studied rocks (see 6.1.12). \n\nSome of the basic porphyritic rocks contain two distinct plagioclase core \n\npopulations in their phenocrysts. One showing higher An contents in the cores than in \n\nthe rims, while the other can show lower amounts of anorthitic in the core molecule \n\nthan its rim and even the matrix phases. \n\nThe most common oxides present in the rocks of the WIM are titanomagnetites \n\nthat coexist with less abundant early chromian spinels (chromites and chromian \n\ntitanomagnetites) as well as ilmenites and magnetites, most of which resulting from the \n\nexsolution of titanomagnetites.  \n\nThe oxygen fugacities and blocking temperatures calculated for the magnetite-\n\nilmenite pairs in these rocks suggest that in most cases these went through later \n\nsubsolidus equilibration and exsolution at temperatures around 500-650\u00ba C. The \n\nobtained fO2 values point towards conditions close to the NNO and FMQ buffers. These \n\ndata are in accordance with fO2 contemporaneous of the crystallization of chromite in \n\nthe LVC (log fO2 = -8.5 at 1200\u00baC) as calculated by D\u2019Orey and Pal\u00e1cios (1986). \n\nThe Sintra gabbro shows the more oxidating conditions of all the studied \n\noccurrences, with fO2 values above the FMQ buffer, which is in agreement with the \n\nresults obtained by Pal\u00e1cios et al. (1995) for this complex. This intrusive complex also \n\nshows widespread signs for late hydrothermal subsolidus alteration, namely the \n\npresence of secondary low temperature amphibole, feldspar, chlorite and epidote, which \n\nmight have led the ilmenites and magnetites to reequilibrate under more oxidizing \n\nconditions. \n\nThe Fe-Ti oxides present in the xenoliths are mostly Fe3+-rich titanomagnetites \n\nthat show a compositional range indicative of crystallization from a relatively evolved \n\nand oxidized melt. Also, their composition is similar to the one shown in the oxides that \n\noccur as inclusions in the green cores of clinopyroxenes, pointing to a common origin. \n\nThe amphiboles present in the sampled rocks are mainly Ti rich kaersutites and \n\npargasites. They appear as late phases that envelop earlier clinopyroxenes, oxides, \n\n\n\n \n\n184 \n \n\napatites and other crystals, as normally or reversely zoned phenocrysts, seldom as \n\nmatrix phases and more rarely as xenocrysts or as a major component in the rare \n\nxenoliths. \n\nThe equilibrium temperatures for the amphibole-plagioclase pairs in the \n\ngabbroic and volcanic rocks are between 880 and 1040\u00ba C, confirming that this \n\nequilibrium is achieved relatively late in the crystallization history of these rocks. \n\nThe compositional similarities between the minerals present in the amphibole \n\nrich xenoliths and as xenocrysts and the ones that constitute the normal crystallization \n\nproducts of the analyzed rock suite suggest that in some cases, some of these might \n\nhave formed from a common parental melt (e.g. amphibole megacrysts), while others \n\nmust have derived from a more evolved but compositionally related magma (e.g. green \n\ncores in the clinopyroxenes). \n\nThe xenoliths can therefore be interpreted as cognate aggregates resulting from \n\nin depth crystallization from a hydrated, basic to intermediate alkaline magma or \n\nalternatively, as residues of wall rock assemblages in equilibrium with a similar melt.  \n\nKaersutite is a common phase both in the xenoliths and xenocrysts. According to \n\nexperimental data, this mineral is stable at depths corresponding to the lithospheric \n\nmantle (e.g. Irving and Frey, 1984; Pilet et al., 2010) and corresponds to a liquidus \n\nphase between 21 and 11 kbar (Merril and Wyllie, 1975),  and again at pressures under \n\n2 kbar in hydrous basic alkaline magmas with low FeOt/TiO2 (Johnson et al., 1989), \n\nwhich is equivalent to depths of approximately 70 to 37 km and 7 km, respectively \n\n(considering an average density of 3000 kg/m3 for the overlying crust and mantle). \n\nMore recently, Irving and Green (2008) proposed that amphibole megacrysts are only \n\nstable up to 15 kbar (? 50 km) in hydrous basic to intermediate liquids. \n\nDue to their larger size, monomineralic nature, ubiquitous reaction rims and \n\nreduced range in composition, showing values comparable to the ones observed in other \n\namphibole crystals, it is implied that the kaersutite xenocrysts could represent the \n\nproducts of high pressure crystallization of a similar basic, hydrous alkaline melt. They \n\nprecipitated as individual crystals from that melt in the interior of a deep conduit or \n\nchamber, and did not aggregate into xenoliths. As the magmas ascended and the \n\npressure dropped, the volatiles exsolved, and the amphibole xenocrysts became unstable \n\nand started developing the observed reaction rims, as discussed in section 6.1.12.  \n\n\n\n \n\n185 \n \n\nThe existence of reversely zoned clinopyroxenes, amphiboles and plagioclase \n\nsupports the occurrence of magma mixing preceding the installation of the rocks that \n\ncontain them.  \n\nIn the case of magmas showing green cored clinopyroxenes, this mixing event \n\nmust have taken place at high depths, as is indicated by the seemingly high pressure \n\nnature of these cores (fig. 6.18), when a basic magma encountered a more evolved, FeO, \n\nalkali, and P2O5 enriched melt from which the green cores crystallized. This resulted in \n\nthe homogenization of the different melts and consequential partial resorption of the \n\nmore evolved green clinopyroxenes as well as in the development of more primitive \n\n(higher Mg#) rims during magma ascension, generating their reverse zoning. The \n\nquantity of basic, primitive liquid must have been much larger than the more evolved \n\nmelt it mixed with since the resulting liquid is still of ultrabasic to basic nature.  \n\nIt is also possible that the observed reversely zoned amphiboles result from the \n\nsame mixing process, since they occur simultaneously with the green cored \n\nclinopyroxenes in the Malveira da Serra sill, which means that this more evolved \n\nmagma would also be volatile rich.  \n\nThe rare reversely zoned plagioclase phenocrysts could also be the product of \n\nhigh pressure crystallization and later mixing with a more primitive magma, as was \n\nsuggested for the plagioclase megacrysts found in basic alkaline rocks in Scotland \n\n(Upton et al., 1999, 2009). \n\nThe existence of high pressure fractionation in the LVC\u2019s magmatic plumbing \n\nsystem is also supported by the existence of a high pressure paragenesis in the Su\u00edmo \n\ndyke outcrop consisting of megacrysts of olivine (Fo ? 91), amphibole, garnet (pyrope), \n\nclino and orthopyroxene and spinel (Pal\u00e1cios, 1985). According to Rankenburg et al. \n\n(2004) the simultaneous presence of garnet and clinopyroxene with compositions \n\nsimilar to the ones observed in this dyke suggests crystallization from a basic melt \n\npressures above 21 kbar (? 70 km). There is, however, the possibility that this \n\nparagenesis might represent xenocrystic material from mantle peridotites. \n\nMoreover, green cored clinopyroxenes, amphibole megacrysts, and xenoliths are \n\noften present simultaneously in the outcrops of basic porphyritic rocks from the second \n\npulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic activity. This suggests that these might be \n\ncrystallization products from the same melt from which the green cored clinopyroxenes \n\nformed. In this case, the green cores, the evolved amphibole cores and the megacrysts \n\n\n\n \n\n186 \n \n\nwould represent phases crystallizing in the middle of the chamber or conduit, while the \n\nxenoliths containing minerals with similar compositions could represent cumulus or \n\nwall rock assemblages previously crystallized from that same magma chamber (fig. \n\n6.34), similarly to what was proposed by Marchev et al. (2006) for the same type of \n\nassemblages observed in lamprophyric dykes in the Rhodopes. The absence of olivine \n\nand plagioclase from those cumulus assemblages could be due to either incomplete \n\nsampling of the ultramafic xenoliths and/or caused by suppression of plagioclase and \n\nolivine crystallization in a hydrous magma at high pressure conditions. Such conditions \n\ngreatly reduce the stability of plagioclase, olivine and garnet, leading to enhanced \n\ncrystallization of calcic clinopyroxene and amphibole instead (e.g. Danyushevsky, \n\n2001; M\u00fcntener et al., 2001). \n\nSuch magma chambers are thought to be located at the depth where ascending \n\nmagmas became neutraly buoyant, which can happen in boundaries between layers with \n\nstrong density contrasts, such as the crust-mantle boundary (e.g. Duda and Schmicke, \n\n1985; Marchev et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2007) or within the lower crust, at depths \n\ncorresponding to the Conrad discontinuity (e.g. Duda and Schmicke, 1985; Sachs and \n\nHansteen, 2000). Magmas stagnated at such depth could then start to crystallize and \n\nevolve, generating the xenoliths by accumulation of crystals fractionated from a basic \n\nmelt and later the green pyroxenes from a more evolved liquid that resulted from the \n\nfractionation and removal of the phases present in the xenoliths.  \n\nThis evolved magma could correspond to the differentiation product of a liquid \n\ngenerated during an earlier pulse of alkaline magmatic activity. Both the WIM and \n\nmany other continental intraplate locations where reversely zoned clinopyroxene and \n\namphibole phenocrysts occur along with amphibole clinopiroxenite xenoliths seem to \n\nhave experienced several pulses of basic alkaline activity previous to the emplacement \n\nor extrusion of the rocks that contain the reversely zoned crystals and xenoliths (e.g. \n\nCantal lavas in the Massif Central, Pilet et al., 2002; magmatism in the Panonian Basin, \n\nDobosi, 1989, Dobosi and Jenner, 1999; West Eiffel, Duda and Schmincke, 1985; \n\nHocheifeld, Jung et al., 2006). It is thus suggested that the parental liquids from which \n\nthe xenoliths and xenocrysts formed correspond to magmas from the earlier pulses of \n\nalkaline activity that stagnated at high depths, probably due to unfavorable stress fields \n\nthat limited the propagation of conduits to the surface. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n187 \n \n\n \nFig. 6.34: Schematic representation of a possible mechanism for the formation of the reversely zoned \n\ncrystals and xenoliths. Initial magma accumulation (first magma pulse) in a magma chamber at high \n\ndepth starts to fractionate and evolve. When a second pulse of more basic magma passes through the \n\nchamber it remobilizes accumulated crystals (xenoliths) and isolated crystals that are suspended in an \n\nevolved melt. These crystals will react with the basic melt and develop rims that are more primitive than \n\ntheir cores, thus generating the reversely zoned crystals. Adapted from Duda and Schminke (1985). \n\n \n\nA phonotephritic to tephrophonolitic liquid has been identified in glass \n\ninclusions found in green clinopyroxenes, titanite and Fe-Ti oxides in clinopyroxenite \n\nxenoliths (Sachs and Hansteen, 2000) that are similar to the ones found in the Late \n\n\n\n \n\n188 \n \n\nCretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM and has been interpret as the parental liquid from \n\nwhich those xenoliths formed. \n\nThe mixing and homogenization of a basic, primitive magma with small portions \n\nof a more evolved, volatile rich liquid would lead to the formation of melt that retains \n\nits basic nature but suffered a small reduction in density and an increase in volatile \n\ncontent when compared with the original basic liquid. This could result in the \n\npressurization of the system, leading to rapid ascension and installation of the magmas.  \n\nA volatile rich magma also has the potential to exsolve those volatiles during \n\nascension and decompression, generating explosive eruptions such as the ones that \n\nhappened before every effusive phase in the LVC, resulting in the formation of the \n\npyroclastic deposits. \n\nIt is therefore suggested that the mixing of basic alkaline magmas with more \n\nevolved magmas of alkaline nature at depth could have been an important factor leading \n\nto the ascension and eruption of some of the basic alkaline magmas of the WIM. \n\nIt should be noted that some authors proposed that the xenoliths and xenocrysts \n\ncontaining green clinopyroxene and amphibole with composition similar to the ones \n\npresent in the analyzed rocks are in fact part of disaggregated metasomatic veins present \n\nwithin the lithospheric mantle that formed as a result of the action of siliceous, volatile \n\nrich (CO2 and H2O) mantle melts (e.g. Pilet et al., 2005, 2008; Niu, 2008; Irving and \n\nGreen, 2008; Upton et al., 2009). These melts can correspond to liquids with a basanite \n\nto hawaiite composition and other products of their differentiation (Irving and Green, \n\n2008; Pilet et al., 2010), previously generated from very low amounts of partial fusion \n\nof slightly enriched peridotites in the asthenosphere (e.g. Pilet et al., 2005, 2008; Niu, \n\n2008). They would precipitate clinopyroxene and amphibole rich assemblages by \n\npercolative fractional crystallization (Pilet et al., 2005, 2010; Irving and Green, 2008) \n\nwhile advancing through the lithospheric mantle.  \n\nThe occurrence of apatite associated with amphibole in xenoliths and as \n\nxenocrysts, similarly to what is observed in the alkaline rocks of the WIM, has also \n\nbeen interpreted as the result of in depth crystallization of alkaline silicic carbonated \n\nmagmas (e.g. O\u2019Reilly and Griffin, 2000), however, the determination of the chemical \n\ncomposition of apatite is necessary in order to confirm this hypothesis. \n\nAccording to Pilet et al. (2008) the melting of these metasomatic hornblendite to \n\npyroxenite veins along with variable amounts of surrounding peridotite can generate \n\n\n\n \n\n189 \n \n\nliquids with a compositional array ranging from nephelinite to alkali basalt with \n\nvariably enriched geochemical signatures. However, it is not possible to unequivocally \n\ndetermine whether these metasomatic amphibole bearing veins are a precursor or a \n\nconsequence of alkaline magmatism (Pilet et al., 2010).  \n\nConsidering the arguments presented above, the xenocrysts and xenoliths \n\nobserved in the studied rocks of the WIM could be interpreted as being part of the \n\nmantle assemblage that melted in order to generate the alkaline magmatism that took \n\nplace in the Late Cretaceous in the WIM, or be the result of crystallization and \n\naccumulation processes that occurred at depth during earlier phases of alkaline \n\nmagmatism. Yet, in order to properly evaluate these hypothesis, additional detailed \n\nmineral chemistry studies are necessary, including the determination of trace element \n\nand isotopic composition of individual mineral phases that occur simultaneously as \n\nxenoliths, xenocrysts and as normally zoned phenocrysts and matrix phases.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n190 \n \n\n7. Geochemistry and petrogenesis \n \n\nIn this chapter the main elementar and isotopic characteristics of the studied Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline rocks and their genetic implications are discussed. \n\nThe samples were prepared for analysis at the Departamento de Geologia da \n\nUniversidade de Lisboa. They were hydraulically crushed, in order to ensure the \n\nremoval of all the signs of alteration, then reduced in size using a jaw crusher and \n\nafterwards powdered in an agate swing mill. \n\nConcentrations for major and trace elements were obtained at Actlabs Ancaster, \n\nOntario, Canada. Major elements were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma \n\nMass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) after alkaline dissolution with lithium \n\nmetaborate/tetraborate followed by nitric acid dissolution (except for Ni, Cu and Zn \n\nmeasurements that were performed after acid digestion). \n\nSamples were prepared and analyzed in a batch system.  Each batch contained a \n\nmethod reagent blank, certified reference material and 17% replicates. Samples were \n\nmixed with a flux of lithium metaborate and lithium tetraborate and fused in an \n\ninduction furnace. The melt was immediately poured into a solution of 5% nitric acid \n\ncontaining an internal standard and mixed continuously until completely dissolved (? 30 \n\nminutes). \n\nThe fused sample was diluted and analyzed by Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN 6000, \n\n6100 or 9000 ICP-MS. Three blanks and five controls (three before sample group and \n\ntwo after) were analyzed per group of samples.  Duplicates were fused and analyzed \n\nevery 15 samples.  The instrument was recalibrated every 40 samples. Calibration was \n\nperformed using seven prepared USGS and CANMET certified reference materials. \n\nOne of the seven standards was used during the analysis for every group of ten samples. \n\nThe prepared sample solution was spiked with internal standards to cover the entire \n\nmass range. \n\nThe calculated reproducibility is ? 1 relative % for major elements and ? 5  \n\nrelative % for trace, rare earth elements (REE) and high field strength elements (HFSE). \n\nThe accuracy of the analyses, evaluated by analyzing international standards, is \n\ngenerally better than 10 relative-%. More information on the procedure, precision and \n\naccuracy of the Actlabs analyses can be found at http://www.actlabs.com.  \n\n\n\n \n\n191 \n \n\n7.1. Major and trace element geochemistry \n\nThe distinction between major and trace elements is based on fundamental \n\ndifferences in geochemical behavior. A \u201cmajor\u201d element is an essential constituent of \n\nthe minerals making up a rock and changing the concentrations of these elements can \n\nlead to changes in the phase assemblage. Typically, these are expressed under oxide \n\nform and are: SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, MnO, FeO, CaO, Na2O, K2O and also Cr2O3, and NiO \n\nfor mantle rocks. The major elements in magmas are by definition compatible, and most \n\nof them are well buffered by the residual minerals. \n\nTrace elements, on the other hand, replace a few atoms of the major elements in \n\nthe crystal structures, without affecting the phase assemblage significantly, so their \n\nabundances are usually lower than 0.01% or 1000 part per million (ppm). They are \n\naccessory in many petrogenetic processes, and they are therefore useful as tracers of \n\nsuch processes. During solid-phase transformations, they will redistribute themselves \n\nlocally between the newly formed mineral phases but, during melting or magmatic \n\nevolution, they are partitioned to a greater or lesser degree into the melt. Thus trace \n\nelement signatures of magmatic rocks carry information about the composition of the \n\nsource and the nature of their melting and evolution processes.  \n\nThe partitioning of trace elements between crystalline and liquid phases is \n\nusually described by a partition coefficient D, which is a simple ratio of two \n\nconcentrations at chemical equilibrium: \n\n?? =  \n???\n\n??\n? \n\n \n\nwhere ??  is the partition coefficient of trace element i, ???  and ??\n? are the concentrations \n\n(by weight) of this element in the solid and liquid phases, respectively. \n\nGoldschmidt (1954) recognized that the distribution of trace elements in \n\nminerals is strongly controlled by ionic radius and charge. The partition coefficient of a \n\ngiven trace element between solid and melt can be quantitatively described by the \n\nelastic strain this element causes by its presence in the crystal lattice. When this strain is \n\nlarge because of the large differences in sizes between lattice space and ionic radius, the \n\npartition coefficient becomes small, and the element is partitioned into the liquid.  \n\n\n\n \n\n192 \n \n\nMany trace elements have values of D &lt;1, because they differ substantially \n\neither in ionic radius and/or charge, from the atoms of the major elements they should \n\nreplace in the crystal lattice and as a consequence remain in the melt. Due to this, they \n\nare called incompatible. In opposition, trace elements such as Sr in plagioclase, Ni in \n\nolivine, and Sc in clinopyroxene fit into their host crystal structures, therefore being \n\ncompatible for those specific minerals, becoming useful in detecting processes where \n\nthe fractionation of these phases is involved.  \n\nIncompatible trace elements are often divided into two major groups, according \n\nto ionic radius and charge, which define their field strenght. High Field Strength \n\nelements (HFSE) are small cations with high ionic charges (e.g. Zr, Hf, Th, Nb, Ta, U, \n\nand the Rare Earth Elements (REE) or lanthanides), and are not easily incorporated in \n\nthe more common silicate minerals. \n\nLarge Ion Lithophile elements (LILE) such as Cs, Rb, K, Ba, Sr, have larger \n\nionic radiuses and lower ionic potential, and have a tendency to be more compatible in \n\nsome minerals. They are also more easily mobilized by hydrous fluids, being more \n\nmobile in alteration and metassomatic processes than HFSE.  \n\nTrace elements with very low partition coefficients may vary by three orders of \n\nmagnitude in the melt, depending on the degree of melting of the source. The \n\nconcentration of such elements is inversely proportional to the melt fraction F, because \n\nthe melt contains, essentially, the entire budget of this trace element and if there is a \n\nlarger amount of melt available, the concentration of trace elements will become more \n\n\u201cdiluted\u201d. Another consequence of highly incompatible behavior of trace elements is \n\nthat if the mineral in the source that contains most of the chemical budget for a certain \n\nelement (e.g. Zr in zircon) is exhausted during melting, their concentration ratios in the \n\nmelt become constant, independently of melt fraction, and will be identical to the \n\nrespective ratio in the mantle source.  \n\n \n\n7.1.1. Classification and Major element geochemistry \n\n \n\nAfter recalculation to 100% on a volatile free basis, all of the sampled rocks, \n\neven the ones with cumulate textures, fall within the alkaline field in the TAS (Total \n\nAlkalis versus Silica, fig. 7.1), considering the compositional division between the \n\nalkaline and sub-alkaline series defined by MacDonald (1968). \n\n\n\n \n\n193 \n \n\nBoth extrusive and intrusive rocks are plotted in the TAS diagram, as well as in \n\nthe other graphs used to characterize the geochemistry and evaluate the compositional \n\nevolution of the studied samples. This was done in order to allow a comparison between \n\nthe basic alkaline extrusive and intrusive occurrences and to try and distinguish any \n\nsignificant variation between them. The number of studied complexes within a \n\nrelatively large area advises some caution when interpreting these diagrams since it is \n\nnot realistic to assume that all the rocks are cogenetic and have evolved in identical \n\nways, even if, in some cases, their age and possibly even parental magmas might be \n\nsimilar. \n\nThe samples from the ultrabasic (SiO2 &lt;45%) Foz da Fonte sill classify as \n\ntephrites since olivine does not occur in this rock.  \n\nThe Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill is not so straightforwardly classified due to its layered \n\nnature, with its samples showing a considerable compositional range. The basic samples \n\n(45 &lt;SiO2 &lt;52 %), that represent layers where more mafic minerals have accumulated, \n\nfall within the basalt field. However, the more evolved of the intermediate (52 &lt;SiO2 &lt;\n\n63 %, Na2O-2  > K2O) layers plot well into the benmoreite field and correspond to the \n\nmore evolved samples in the dataset. The mesocratic layers that constitute most of the \n\nsill actually plot in the mugearite field. \n\nThe studied flows and necks from the LVC are ultrabasic to basic rocks that \n\nclassify as basanites (Ol > 10 %) and alkali basalts (Lexim neck), with the plugs also \n\nfalling on the basanite field. The sills integrated in this complex show more evolved \n\ncompositions, ranging from hawaiites (Lomba dos Pianos) to mugearites (Montelevar \n\nand An\u00e7os), benmoreites (An\u00e7os). The Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill shows a distinct, more \n\nalkali.rich and SiO2 undersaturated, phonotephritic composition, unlike the other nearby \n\nsills that are also included in the LVC. \n\nThe three different dykes from the Cascais region plot in different fields of the \n\nTAS diagram. The porphyritic basalt from Bafureira beach falls within the alkaline \n\nbasalt field, the dyke that outcrops in the Parede beach can be classified as a tephrite \n\nand the one collected in Po\u00e7a beach plots in the hawaiite field. \n\nThe Malveira da Serra sill is also classified as a tephrite since it lacks olivine. \n\nThe two sampled Loul\u00e9 dykes are both ultrabasic lamprophyric rocks and plot in \n\nthe foidite field, but the monchiquite C-20 shows a much higher amount of alkalis than \n\nthe olivine phyric C-12-1. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n194 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.1: Total Alkalis versus Silica diagram for the studied samples, after LeBas et al. (1986). Line \n\ndividing the alkaline and sub-alkaline series from MacDonald (1968). \n \n\nMost of the samples from the Fontanelas seamount are very altered, and contain \n\na high amount of vesicles filled with secondary alteration products (sometimes over \n\n40% of the volume of the sample). Although they were subject to leaching in 1.5N HCl \n\nbefore being sent out for analysis, their Loss On Ignition (LOI) values were still very \n\nhigh (6.5-10%), so caution must be taken while trying to classify them and interpreting \n\ntheir whole rock geochemical data. The lavas from this seamount are mostly ultrabasic \n\nrocks and fall in the foidite field, except for one sample that plots on the alkali basalt \n\nfield. They are all alkaline but it is possible that their total alkalis content is not \n\n\n\n \n\n195 \n \n\nrepresentative of its original value due to alkali removal or addition during alteration. \n\nThe high degree of alteration of the samples does not allow further classification of the \n\nfoidites as nephelinites or leucitites. \n\nAs for the granular rocks represented in fig. 7.1, the gabbroic plug present in \n\nMafra falls on the basanite/tephrite field, alongside a lot of samples from the LVC, \n\nSintra, Sines, Monchique and the Foz da Fonte sill. \n\nThe basic intrusive rocks from Sintra plot on the basanite/tephrite fields as well, \n\nwith the diorite being slightly more evolved and falling in the hawaiite field.  \n\nIn its turn, the mafic intrusives from Sines show larger scatter in the TAS \n\ndiagram. The ultrabasic rocks from the Pedras Negras outcrop plot on the picrobasalt \n\nfield, reinforcing the idea introduced in section 6.1 that these are in fact products of \n\naccumulation processes. One of the samples from the amphibole rich gabbro from the \n\nsouthern gabbro outcrops plots on the basanite/tephrite field near the Sintra gabbros, \n\nwhile the other sample from the same outcrop and the diorite fall in the more evolved \n\nhawaiite field, with the diorite being the more silica rich rock in this group. \n\nCompared with the basic rocks from other intrusive complexes, the mafic rocks \n\nfrom Monchique are more alkali rich for a given SiO2 content. On the TAS diagram one \n\nsample is ultrabasic and plots near one of the Loul\u00e9 samples on the foidite field, \n\nalthough it is even more SiO2 poor. The other samples fall in the basanite/tephrite field \n\nwith the more SiO2 rich one even plotting on the phonotephritic field. \n\n \n\nAnother feature evident in the TAS diagram is the existence of two different \n\nmagmatic evolution trends. One progresses towards silica oversaturared compositions \n\nand is clearly more important, as it includes most of the analyzed samples as well as \n\nother rocks of the same age that were not sampled in this study (e.g. Sintra granite and \n\nsyenite, Sines syenite, rhyolites from the LVC). This trend illustrates evolution from a \n\nsilica undersaturated basanitic parent towards silica saturation, originating the \n\nbenmoreites of the An\u00e7os sill and eventually culminating in rocks of rhyolitic or granitic \n\ncomposition (not shown, see Pal\u00e1cios, 1985, and Matos Alves, 1964).  \n\nThe other trend is SiO2 undersaturated and it also departs from a possible \n\nbasanitic parent but progresses towards silica undersaturated compositions represented \n\nby the tephriphonolites of the Monchique complex and of the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill, \n\nculminating in the nepheline syenites (not shown) that form the larger part of the \n\nMonchique igneous complex (e.g. Valadares, 2004). \n\n\n\n \n\n196 \n \n\nLooking at a broader context, the trend towards silica oversaturated \n\ncompositions seems to dominate in the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism of the \n\nWIM, being common to the LVC (Pal\u00e1cios, 1985), the Sintra igneous complex where \n\nthe granites and syenites make up most of the outcropping area (e.g. Matos Alves, \n\n1964), the Sines igneous complex where quartz bearing syenites are found (e.g. \n\nCanilho, 1972) and even some of the seamounts that constitute the MTR contain SiO2 \n\nsaturated rocks (Merle et al., 2006).  \n\nMost of the samples integrate the potassic series defined by Middlemost (1975) \n\nfor basic alkali rocks, although all the basic samples of the Sintra igneous complex, the \n\namphibole rich gabbros in the Sines complex, a few samples from the LVC and one \n\nfrom Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas all plot in the sodic series field (fig. 7.2). However, their positioning \n\nin the sodic series can be due to the accumulation of Na-rich phases such as plagioclase \n\nor amphibole. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.2: Classification diagram for the alkaline basalt series after Middlemost (1975). \n\n \n\nOnly one sample from the Fontanelas seamount (AT692E) falls in the highly \n\npotassic series field, but the higher potassium content in this sample might be due to \n\n\n\n \n\n197 \n \n\nsecondary addition of K during alteration. K addition from seawater has already been \n\nreported in submarine basalts from the MTR (Merle et al., 2009) meaning that a similar \n\nprocess is behind the high K in the Fontanelas seamount. \n\nThe Mg# [Mg# = 100 x (MgO/(MgO+FeO)), with FeO being calculated  \n\naccording to the Fe2O3/FeO ratios recommended by Middlemost (1989)] for these rocks \n\nvaries between 70.2 for dyke C-12-1 in Loul\u00e9 and 34.7 one of the felsic layers in the \n\nPa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill, averaging  at 54  in the basic  and  ultrabasic rocks (SiO2 &lt;52%),  \n\nwhich  is somewhat lower than expected for basic and ultrabasic alkaline igneous rocks. \n\nThis suggests that these magmas have undergone significant fractional crystallization in \n\na deeper, unexposed part of the magmatic plumbing system before eruption or \n\nemplacement. \n\nMajor elements are plotted against SiO2 in figure 7.3, with SiO2 being used as an \n\nindicator of magmatic differentiation. \n\nOwing to their relatively wide geographical (e.g. figs. 4.1, 4.2) and \n\nchronological (94-72 Ma, see section 5) distribution, as well as diverse modes of \n\noccurrence, the studied rocks cannot be considered cogenetic. In this perspective, the \n\nbinary plots presented from here onwards and containing all of the studied samples are \n\nonly used as tool to identify possible common processes affecting the evolution of these \n\nrocks and emphasize similarities or differences detected between each of the different \n\noccurrences. \n\nIn the studied rocks, MgO, FeO, TiO2 and CaO all decrease with increasing SiO2 \n\ncontents, while Al2O3, Na2O and K2O increase. P2O5 shows very scattered concentration \n\nvalues that seem to be characterized by an initial increase, followed by a significant \n\ndecrease for SiO2 > 45%, which can be interpreted as resulting from apatite \n\nfractionation.  \n\nSome deviations from the apparent trends are probably the consequence of the \n\nalready discussed crystal accumulation processes. These can justify the higher MgO in \n\nsome of the Sines gabbros, as well as in the porphyritic basalts of LVC\u2019s flows and \n\nnecks and in the case of the porphyritic dykes from Cascais due to olivine accumulation \n\n(fig. 7.3). The high FeOT and TiO2 values found in the more basic samples in the Pa\u00e7o \n\nd\u2019Ilhas sill (fig. 7.3) can also be attributed to the accumulation of Fe rich mafic minerals \n\nsuch as Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxene in the mafic layers. \n\n\n\n \n\n198 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.3: Plots of selected major elements versus SiO2 content for the analyzed samples. Legend as in \n\nfigs. 7.1 and 7.2. \n\n\n\n \n\n199 \n \n\nAl2O3 also shows some spread (fig. 7.3), with a few samples from the basic \n\nrocks in Sintra and from the Vasco da Gama beach in Sines being more enriched in Al \n\nthan other rocks with the same SiO2 content. On the other hand, the samples from \n\nPedras Negras in Sines, the mafic layers from the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill and the porphyritic \n\nbasaltic dyke from Cascais show lower than expected Al contents. These opposite \n\nbehaviors of the same element, sometimes in the same intrusive (Sines) are probably \n\ndue to plagioclase removal during fractional crystallization creating the Al2O3 deficit in \n\nsome samples (Pedras Negras gabbro in Sines, mafic layers in Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas) while its \n\naccumulation led to Al2O3 excess in other samples (Az\u00f3ia and Praia Vasco da Gama \n\ngabbros in Sintra and Sines, respectively). \n\nCaO seems to decrease with increasing SiO2 (fig. 7.3). However, the high CaO \n\nvalues in the samples from the Fontanelas seamount can be related to secondary \n\nalteration processes that added carbonate, and consequently CaO to these rocks. \n\nThe scatter observed in the plots of Na2O, K2O and P2O5 against SiO2 (fig. 7.3) \n\nmight be caused by either to fractionation and accumulation processes, or due to \n\ndifferences in source composition that originated magmas which could possess different \n\nconcentrations of Na, K and P. Also, crustal contamination processes can influence the \n\namount of alkalies present in the melt since these elements can be very abundant in \n\ncrustal rocks. The importance of the contamination processes will be discussed in \n\nsection 7.3.2  \n\nSamples that carry feldspathoids (basic rocks from Monchique, Eiras do Fai\u00e3o \n\nsill, Loul\u00e9 dykes) usually have higher alkali contents and often correspond to the \n\nhighest K2O and Na2O contents for a given SiO2 value observed in the diagrams. \n\nPlagioclase and feldspar accumulation in the gabbroic rocks can produce similar effects, \n\nwith their removal causing the lower K2O and Na2O contents observed in the mafic \n\ncumulates such as the Pedras Negras gabbro in Sines and the mafic layers in the Pa\u00e7o \n\nd\u2019Ilhas sill.  \n\nAs for P2O5, samples such as the Sintra, Monchique and the Sines Vasco da \n\nGama beach gabbros clearly show signals of apatite accumulation, which justifies the \n\nhigh P2O5 contents in these rocks. The low contents of P2O5 in the Pedras Negras \n\ngabbro in Sines seem, again, to be due to accumulation of P poor phases like olivine and \n\nclinopyroxene. \n\nIn more general terms, the decrease in MgO, FeO and TiO2 can explained by the \n\ncrystallization and removal of mafic minerals such as olivine, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti \n\n\n\n \n\n200 \n \n\noxides and amphibole. Clinopyroxene and amphibole also incorporate significant CaO \n\nand their removal, coupled with CaO rich plagioclase, can also explain the decrease in \n\nthis oxide with increasing silica contents. \n\nAl2O3 clearly increases up to values around 55% SiO2 and from then onwards \n\nseems to show a slight decrease with increasing SiO2, probably due to the removal of \n\ncrystallizing plagioclase \n\nThe generalized increase in Na2O, K2O, and SiO2 can be justified by the relative \n\nenrichment in these elements caused by removal of MgO, FeO, TiO2, CaO and even \n\nAl2O3 by crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxides. None \n\nof those minerals is particularly rich in those elements so their fractionation does not \n\ncontribute to the decrease of their concentrations in the residual liquids. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.4: Plots Al2O3/CaO and Al2O3/TiO2 versus SiO2 content for the analyzed samples. \n\n \n\nThe Al2O3/CaO ratio increases from nearly chondritic towards supercondritic \n\nvalues (chondrites ? 1.23, Palme and O\u2019Neill, 2003) with increasing silica contents, \n\nwhich argues for the importance of clinopyroxene and plagioclase removal on the \n\nevolution of the magmatic liquids since these remove show low Al2O3/CaO. \n\nIn their turn, the Al2O3/TiO2 ratios (fig. 7.4) are lower than the ones found in \n\nchondrites (18.5-22.4, Palme and O\u2019Neill, 2003), meaning that these magmas are \nenriched in Ti relative to a primordial source. Also, as seen on fig. 7.4, this ratio \n\nincreases with increasing differentiation. That is a consequence of crystallization and \n\nremoval of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxene that remove TiO2 from the liquid, \n\nconfirming the importance of the fractionation of these minerals in the evolution of \n\n\n\n \n\n201 \n \n\nthese magmas. Crystal accumulation seems to be responsible for some deviations from \n\nthe general trend observed by the samples from Sines, Sintra and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas.  \n\n \n\n7.1.2. Trace element geochemistry \n\nAs was mentioned before, certain trace elements see their concentrations \n\ndecrease with progressive crystallization and removal of minerals. These elements \n\npossess ionic radius and valence similar to the more abundant major elements and can \n\ntherefore substitute these major elements and integrate the crystal structure of some \n\nspecific mineral(s). They are referred to as compatible trace elements and show D > 1 \n\nfor the phases in which they are compatible (table 7.1).  \n\n \nTable 7.1: Partition coeffiecients (D) for selected minerals and elements in basaltic (s.l.) rocks according \n\nto the data available on GERM database (www.earthref.org, Matsui et al., 1977; Takashi, 1978; Okamoto, \n\n1979; Villemant et al., 1981; Lemarchand et al., 1987; Nielsen, 1992; Beattie, 1994; Latourrette et al., \n\n1995;  Esperanza et al., 1997; Zack and Brumm, 1998; Bindeman et al., 1998; Green et al., 2000; Adam \n\nand Green, 2006). \n\n D \n\n Ni Cr V Sc Sr \n\n Min Max Min Max Min Max Min Max Min Max \nOlivine 2.86 47 0.64 1.18 0.15 0.23 0.22 0.32 1.5E-05 0.01 \nClinopyroxene 2.5 10 8.49 26 3.1 5.7 1.63 3.62 0.104 0.2 \nMagnetite 31 65  153 0.02 6.85 0.67 1.96   \nIlmenite  3.8  6  11 0.58    \nPlagioclase 0.04 0.5 0.08 0.6 0.01 0.27 0.04 0.1 2.7 10 \nAmphibole 16 18 0.21 7 3.4 5.7 1.59 2.86 0.298 0.42 \n\n \n\nWithin the analyzed samples, compatible trace element correspond to Ni, Cr, V, \n\nSc and to a lesser degree, Sr. The variation in their concentrations will be caused mostly \n\nby the precipitation and removal of minerals identified as phenocryst phases (see section \n\n6.2) such as olivine (Ni), clinopyroxene (Cr, V, Sc, Ni) , Fe-Ti oxides (V, Sc, Ni, Cr), \n\nplagioclase (Sr) and others, but one cannot discard source heterogeneity as a possible \n\ncause of diversity in the observed concentrations for these elements. They are plotted \n\nagainst Mg# instead of SiO2 in fig. 7.5 since this index allows for a relative expansion \n\nof the X axis values in what respects basic rocks, facilitating the detection of early \n\nprocesses that involve the crystallization of mafic minerals which accommodate some \n\nof these compatible elements. \n\n\n\n \n\n202 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.5: Plots of selected compatible trace elements versus Mg# for the analyzed samples. Given that the \n\nplotted samples are not cogenetic, the drawn lines are simply indicative of what may be interpreted as a \n\ngeneral evolutionary tendency of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas. \n\n\n\n \n\n203 \n \n\nNi is strongly compatible in olivine, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides and is often \n\nused as an indicator for olivine fractionation since this is usually the more abbundant \n\nearly crystallizing phase in basic alkaline magmas (tab. 7.1). As is observed in fig. 7.5, \n\nthe Ni contents are usually low, rarely surpassing 200 ppm, and decrease very rapidly \n\nwith decreasing Mg#, pointing towards early removal of olivine. The samples from the \n\nFontanelas seamount are an exception to this case, as they show Ni contents up to 314 \n\nppm. \n\nCr is also strongly compatible in clinopyroxene, amphibole and especially spinel \n\n(tab. 7.1), and shows a behavior similar to Ni, decreasing quickly with decreasing Mg# \n\n(fig. 7.5), also arguing for the early removal of these phases. Again, the lavas from the \n\nFontanelas seamount are the samples with the highest Cr contents. \n\nIt is noticeable that none of the analyzed samples fit the criteria that define \n\nprimary magmas (i. e. magmas which are products of mantle melting and have not been \n\nmodified by fractional crystallization or interaction with country rock during ascension, \n\nand are characterized by: Mg# > 68, Ni > 320 ppm, Cr > 1000 ppm, e.g. Frey et al., \n\n1978), implying that, as was previously proposed, these magmas must have undergone \n\nimportant spinel, olivine and probably clinopyroxene fractionation in depth prior to \n\neruption or installation.   \n\nV is very compatible in Fe-Ti oxides such as magnetite and ilmenite and slightly \n\nless so in clinopyroxene and amphibole (tab. 7.1). In fig. 7.5, V also shows a negative \n\ncorrelation with decreasing Mg for values lower than 55 Mg#, as a consequence of the \n\nremoval of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxenes from then onwards. For Mg# values higher \n\nthan 55 the samples show more or less scattered but relatively stable V values, \n\nreflecting either source heterogeneity or accumulation. The previously discussed mafic \n\ncumulate layers of the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill, and Sines Pedras Negras gabbro show higher V \n\nvalues than samples with similar Mg# due to their cumulate nature, while other samples \n\nfrom the basic rocks in Monchique or the Fontanelas seamounts might show higher V \n\nabundances due to source enrichment since they do not show any clear petrographic \n\nsigns of crystal accumulation.  \n\nSc is mainly compatible in clinopyroxene and also with magnetite and \n\namphibole. It shows a negative correlation with decreasing Mg# arguing for an \n\nimportant role for early clinopyroxene and magnetite removal in the evolution of the \n\nalkaline series. The same samples that fell out of the main trend in the V vs. Mg# \n\ndiagram also plot out of the main trend here, due to the same processes of accumulation \n\n\n\n \n\n204 \n \n\n(Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas, Sines). The positioning of the less evolved samples from Monchique and \n\nFontanelas probably reflects their origin from a distinct source or from a similar source \n\nthat was affected by lower degrees of partial melting. \n\nSr is only compatible in plagioclase and its concentration in the melt should \n\nlower with the progressive crystallization and removal of this mineral. Plotted against \n\nMg# the Sr concentrations seem to increase until Mg# ? 50 and start to decrease from \n\nthen onwards, marking the initiation of removal of plagioclase from the system. The \n\nsamples from the Fontanelas seamount show homogeneously low Sr values for all \n\nsamples, due to either removal of this mobile element during seawater alteration, or \n\nduring the leaching that these samples were subject to prior to analysis. Some samples \n\nfrom Monchique and Loul\u00e9 show unusually high Sr values probably due to being \n\nderived from a more Sr enriched source or even due to resulting from lower degrees of \n\npartial melting of a source similar to the other basic alkaline rocks. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.6: Plots of CaO/Al2O3 vs. Sc for and TiO2 vs. V for the analyzed samples. Legend as in fig. 7.5. \n\n \n\nThe strong correlation between the TiO2 and V contents of the studied rocks \n\nconfirms the importance of Ti-rich clinopyroxene and especially Fe-Ti oxides (up to 5% \n\nV2O3 and 54% TiO2, see annex IV) in controlling the distribution of these elements. \n\nSc and the CaO/Al2O3 ratio also show a strong correlation, arguing that these \n\nvalues are both controlled by the crystallization of clinopyroxene. Samples from the \n\nFontanelas seamount show higher CaO/Al2O3 values probably due to secondary CaO \n\n\n\n \n\n205 \n \n\naddition during alteration, while the rocks from Monchique and Loul\u00e9 seem to be \n\nenriched in CaO. \n\n \n\nWhenever trace elements possess ionic radius or valences that do not allow them \n\nto integrate the structures of the more common minerals crystallizing from a silicate \n\nmagma, their concentration in the residual liquid will tend to increase with \n\ndifferentiation. These are known as incompatible trace elements.  \n\n7.1.2.1  Primitive mantle normalized multielemental diagrams  \n\nPrimitive mantle normalized multielemental diagrams, or spider diagrams, are a \n\nquick way to visualize and characterize the abundance and variation of incompatible \n\ntrace elements in igneous rocks. They allow for the display of many elements, whose \n\nconcentration is normalized to a primitive mantle composition (Palme and O\u2019Neill, \n\n2003), facilitating the detection of relative enrichments and/or depletions in relation to \n\nthis composition. For the discussion of trace element signatures it is important to remind \n\nthat the trace element contents of plutonic rocks may not be the best representatives of \n\nthe compositions of their parental melts due to the likely occurrence of crystal removal \n\nand accumulation processes which may modify these signatures, although some of their \n\noriginal compositional features can still be distinguishable.  \n\nGiven that geochronological data allowed the identification of two separate \n\npulses of magmatism within the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism (Miranda et al., \n\n2009, see section 5), and since changes in incompatible trace element concentrations \n\ncan be a useful tool in detecting differences between magmas of similar composition, \n\nthe samples from both groups will be presented separately when appropriate.  \n\nBelow, the primitive mantle normalized spider diagrams and chondrite (Palme \n\nand O\u2019Neill, 2003) normalized Rare Earth Element (REE) diagrams for individual or \n\ngroups of major occurrences are represented and will be discussed separately (figs. 7.7 \n\nand 7.8), in order to facilitate the interpretation of the obtained results.  \n\nIn general, all samples belonging to the second and more recent pulse of alkaline \n\nactivity in the WIM (75-72 Ma, Miranda et al., 2009, this study) are incompatible \n\nelement enriched and in most cases, the more basic samples show negative K, P, Hf and \n\nZr anomalies. \n\nIn the south, the 72 Ma Loul\u00e9 dykes and basic rocks from the Monchique \n\nigneous complex show similar patterns, with negative anomalies in K, Zr, Hf and \n\nsometimes even Ti and P (fig. 7.7).  \n\n\n\n \n\n206 \n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.7: Primitive upper mantle normalized (Palme and O\u2019Neill, 2003)  multielemental plots for the \n\nrocks of the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline igneous activity (75-72 Ma). \n\n \n\nIn the Sines igneous complex, the basic rocks are not as enriched as in \n\nMonchique. The cumulate nature of the Pedras Negras gabbro is reflected on their trace \n\nelement abundance patterns, with these being the least trace element enriched samples, \n\nwhich also show a small positive Ti anomaly due to the accumulation of Fe-Ti oxides \n\nand Clinopyroxene. Otherwise, they show the same negative K, P, Zr and Hf anomalies \n\nas observed in the basic rocks from Monchique. \n\n\n\n \n\n207 \n \n\nThe Vasco da Gama beach amphibole rich gabbros are more trace element \n\nenriched and display more pronounced K, Hf and Zr negative anomalies and are missing \n\nthe negative P anomaly probably due to accumulation of apatite. Also, they show a \n\nsmall negative Ti anomaly that might be consequence of the accumulation of Ti rich \n\nphases in the Pedras Negras gabbro. The higher incompatible element abundances in \n\nthis gabbro supports the view that these samples represent a higher part of the magma \n\nchamber where the residual, more evolved liquid resulting from the progressive removal \n\nof mafic minerals to form cumulates such as the Pedras Negras gabbro gathered. \n\nThe spidergram for the Sines diorite shows a smoother patern with less \n\npronounced or inexistent negative anomalies in K, Zr, Hf and Ti but with small negative \n\nanomalies in Sr and P, probably due to the removal of plagioclase and apatite, \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe basic rocks from the Sintra igneous complex show trace element \n\nabundances and patterns similar to the ones observed in the Sintra and Sines complexes, \n\nwith negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies, sometimes also showing negative Ti as well. P \n\ncan show a positive anomaly due to the accumulation of apatite in some of these rocks. \n\nThe gabbros from the Peninha outcrop show more enriched signatures and \n\nnegative Ti and positive P anomalies, while the ones from the Az\u00f3ia outcrop show the \n\nopposite behavior, i.e. positive Ti and negative P anomalies. This suggests that these \n\ngabbroic outcrops represent different zones in the magma chamber. In this perspective, \n\nthe Az\u00f3ia gabbros could correspond to a deeper level where Ti rich oxides accumulated \n\nand the Peninha gabbro to a higher level of the same chamber where the residual, Ti \n\ndepleted and incompatible element enriched liquid accumulated. \n\nThe diorite shows a pattern with an enrichment level intermediate between both \n\nthe gabbro outcrops. \n\nThe Malveira da Serra sill is plotted with the basic rocks from the Sintra \n\ncomplex since some authors proposed that it might be a precursor of the installation of \n\nthis complex (e.g. Kullberg and Kullberg, 2000). It shows a similar spidergram to these \n\nand other Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks, but with smaller K, Zr and Hf negative \n\nanomalies and with a small Sr negative anomaly. \n\n Necks, flows and plugs from the LVC and Cascais dykes all show similar \n\nincompatible element patterns between themselves and with the same pronounced \n\nnegative K anomalies but with smaller P, Zr and Hf anomalies. One of the Cascais \n\ndykes shows a positive P anomaly, as a result of the abundance of apatite in the sample. \n\n\n\n \n\n208 \n \n\nTi varies between having no anomaly and showing small negative or positive \n\nanomalies, probably due to the removal or accumulation of Fe-Ti oxides and \n\nClinopyroxene. \n\nThe sills associated with the LVC and the Sintra igneous complex have basic \n\n(Lomba dos Pianos, Malveira da Serra) to more evolved (Eiras do Fai\u00e3o, Montelevar, \n\nAn\u00e7os) compositions and show incompatible trace element patterns that reflect the \n\nprocesses responsible for that evolution. \n\nThe phonotephritic Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill shows the more enriched character of all \n\nthe sills, where the same negative K, P, Zr and Hf anomalies seen in the more basic \n\nrocks are observed, as well as a pronounced negative Ti anomaly probably caused by \n\nthe removal of Fe-Ti oxides and Clinopyroxenes . \n\nThe intermediate An\u00e7os and Montelevar sills show similar spidergrams, with \n\nabsent or very small negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies, while having pronounced \n\nnegative Ti and P anomalies due to the removal of Fe-Ti oxides and Clinopyroxenes, \n\nand apatite. \n\nThe basic Lomba dos Pianos sill show spidergrams more similar to the other \n\nbasic rocks in the province, with small negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies and but is \n\ndistinguished by a positive Sr anomaly probably due to the abbundance of plagioclase \n\nphenocrysts in the sill. \n\nIncompatible trace element patterns for the Fontanelas seamount have slightly \n\ndifferent trace element patterns than the onshore basic samples. All of the samples show \n\na pronounced negative, K and Sr anomalies. The Sr anomaly was probably caused by \n\nthe Sr removal during the replacement of plagioclase in the matrix by secondary \n\nalteration products. These alteration products might have kept some of the Sr but were \n\ntotally or partially removed during the leaching with HCl these samples were subject to \n\nprior to analysis. The K anomaly is common to all of the Late Cretaceous rocks and \n\nmight be related to retention in the source, but there is also the possibility that it might \n\nhave been enhanced by the alteration and/or leaching, as was previously discussed for \n\nSr. Only one sample from Fontanelas shows a negative Zr and Hf anomaly and another \n\none shows a spike in P, probably due to the important occurrence of apatite in \n\ninclusions in amphibole. \n\nConsidering the uncontaminated nature of these basic and ultrabasic magmas \n\n(further developed in section 7.3.2), demonstrated by the absence of Ta and Nb troughs, \n\nand considering that the crystallization and removal of phases that might cause the \n\n\n\n \n\n209 \n \n\ndepletion of these incompatible trace elements did not occur, these negative anomalies \n\nare likely to be caused by retention of these elements in residual mantle phases.  \n\nThe residual phases responsible for the retention and consequent negative \n\nanomalies on the multielemental diagrams of rocks from the second pulse of alkaline \n\nmagmatic activity might have formed during a metasomatic episode and correspond to \n\nK-rich amphibole or phlogopite, for K (e.g. Class and Goldstein, 1997), apatite in the \n\ncase of P (e.g. O\u2019Reilly and Griffin, 2000), and eventually baddeleyite or zircon for Zr \n\nand Hf (Andronikov and Foley, 2002; Kerr et al., 2010). These phases would either \n\nremain as a part of the mantle source during the small degree of partial melting that \n\ncharacterizes the generation of basic and ultrabasic alkaline magmas or equilibrate with \n\nthem before their ascension and installation at crustal levels.  \n\nSmall Ti negative anomalies are also visible in some samples, arguing for early \n\nremoval of this element by the crystallization of Fe-Ti oxides, respectively or due to \n\nsource retention in Ti rich minerals.  \n\nThe nature and origin of these anomalies, their possible causes and implications \n\nfor the composition and evolution history of the mantle source will be discussed in \n\ndetail in section 7.4. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.8: Primitive upper mantle normalized (Palme and O\u2019Neill, 2003)  multielemental plots for the ? 90 \n\nMa alkaline igneous rocks. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n210 \n \n\nThe older intrusions (Foz da Fonte and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sills), that belong to the first \n\npulse of magmatic activity in the WIM (94-88 Ma, Miranda et al., 2009, this study), \n\nshow multielemental plots that are distinct from the ones seen on the c. 72 Ma rocks \n\n(fig. 7.8). They have no systematic Zr and Hf anomalies and possess less important or \n\nabsent K anomalies. Among the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas samples, the more evolved samples show \n\nnegative Ti anomalies due to the removal of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopiroxene to the basic \n\nlayers. \n\nAccordingly, the basic layers possess small negative anomalies for K and Sr. \n\nThese anomalies may have been generated by the removal of plagioclase and K feldspar \n\ninto the leucocratic layers by flotation of these less dense crystals, as suggested by \n\nMahmoudi (1991). This is in agreement with the observed macroscopic layering in this \n\nsill. \n\n \n\nThe REE (Rare Earth Elements) compositions are more homogeneous, with all \n\nthe samples showing fractionated chondrite normalized REE patterns, being enriched in \n\nLREE (Light REE) and MREE (Medium REE) over HREE (Heavy REE) (LaN/YbN = \n\n48.9 \u2013 8.8; TbN/YbN = 3.4-1.9) suggesting the influence of residual garnet during \n\nmelting events since HREE are significantly more compatible than MREE in garnet \n\nthan in the melt (e.g. McKenzie and O\u2019Nions, 1991; Adam and Green, 2006). The REE \n\npatterns of each of the sampled occurrences (fig. 7.9) will be discussed in more detail \n\nbelow. \n\n7.1.2.2  Rare Earth Element abbundances \n\nNo systematic differences are observed between rocks from both pulses of Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline igneous activity. \n\nThe southern Monchique and Loul\u00e9 samples are among the most fractionated \n\n(fig. 7.9a), with (La/Yb)N ranging from 48.9 to 22.9. The patterns in the Loul\u00e9 \n\nlamprophyres have a steeper slope and can cut across the curves of some of the basic \n\nMonchique samples, suggesting the derivation from a more enriched source or a source \n\nwith higher amounts of residual garnet. \n\nOn the other hand, the Sines gabbros and diorite are among the least fractionated \n\n(fig. 7.9b), with the Pedras Negras samples ((La/Yb)N = 15.2-8.8) being the least REE \n\nenriched of all the analyzed samples, probably as a result of their origin as cumulates of \n\nrelatively REE depleted phases, such as olivine. Some of the samples from Sines, along \n\nwith some of the Sintra gabbros ((La/Yb)N = 18.4-14.9) show small positive Eu \n\n\n\n \n\n211 \n \n\nanomalies (Eu/Eu* 0.97-1.28) possibly due to the accumulation of Eu retaining \n\nplagioclase (fig. 7.9c).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.9: Chondrite normalized (Palme and O\u2019Neill, 2003) REE variation diagrams for all the studied \n\noccurrences. \n \n\nSamples from the LVC necks and flows, Cascais dykes and Mafra gabbroic plug \n\nall show similar LREE enriched patterns ((La/Yb)N = 26.1-13.3, fig. 7.9d). However, \n\nthe Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill shows some of the more enriched and fractionated compositions \n\nof the complex ((La/Yb)N = 29.6-28.7), while the more basic Lomba dos Pianos sill has \n\n\n\n \n\n212 \n \n\nREE patterns similar to the basalts. The more evolved An\u00e7os and Montelevar sills are \n\nslightly more enriched in HREE ((La/Yb)N = 16.3-15.7; fig. 7.9e) which show mostly \n\nflat patterns, unlike the gently oblique basic samples. \n\nThe Fontanelas seamount shows the same LREE enriched patterns ((La/Yb)N = \n\n25.3-16.6; fig. 7.9f), as the samples from Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas and Foz da Fonte sills ((La/Yb)N \n\n= 20.8-14.7; fig. 7.9g), which belong to the first pulse of alkaline magmatic activity. \n\nThe more evolved Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas samples are also more HREE enriched showing \n\nthe same flat HREE slopes observed in other more differentiated sills.  \n\nThe relatively flat HREE patterns observed in the more evolved samples \n\ntranslate into low (Gd/Lu)N ratios (2.4-3.16 for the more evolved sills against 5.99-3.2 \n\nfor the remaining samples, fig. 7.10c) and can be interpreted as an indicator of the \n\ninfluence of crustal contamination processes as an evolution mechanism for these rocks, \n\nsince the continental crust is more HREE enriched and shows flatter HREE patterns and \n\nconsequentially lower (Gd/Lu)N ratios (1.54-1.61, Rudnick and Gao, 2003). Further \n\nindicators for the occurrence of crustal contamination processes will be discussed in \n\nsection 7.3.2. \n\nCrystal fractionation does not seem to change the (La/Yb)N of the samples  since \n\nYbN increases but (La/Yb)N ratios remain the same (fig. 7.10a).  \n\nHowever, crystal fractionation and accumulation are responsible for some minor \n\nnegative and positive Eu anomalies, respectively (fig. 7.9). Specifically the slightly \n\npositive anomalies in some of the Sintra and Sines gabbros due to plagioclase \n\naccumulation and the negative Eu anomalies in the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill, Sines diorite and in \n\none of the basic rocks from Monchique caused by the removal of this mineral.  \n\nMost of the samples show Eu/Eu* values of approximately 1.1 (with Eu* = \n\n?(SmNxGdN); Rollinson, 1993), corresponding to a small positive Eu anomaly (fig. \n\n7.10b). A correlation between lower Eu/Eu* and Sr/Nd is also observed, suggesting that \n\nthe small negative Eu anomalies formed due to crystal fractionation and removal of \n\nplagioclase from the liquid in some of the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill, Sines diorite, Monchique \n\nand Montelevar sill (fig. 7.10b). This process also lowered the Sr/Nd ratio, since Sr is \n\npreferentially incorporated in plagioclase. Plagioclase accumulation is responsible for \n\nthe higher Eu/Eu* and Sr/Nd values of some of the Sintra and Sines gabbros and also of \n\nthe plagioclase rich Lomba dos Pianos sill. \n\nPlagioclase removal, however, seems to have played a relatively small role in \n\ncontrolling the evolution of these magmas since there are not many samples with low  \n\n\n\n \n\n213 \n \n\nEu anomalies and low Sr/Nd coupled with Eu/Eu*. Also, Al2O3 continues to increase \n\nwith increasing SiO2 for most of the samples (fig. 7.3), except some of the layered Pa\u00e7o \n\nd\u2019Ilhas sill.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.10: a) YbN vs. (La/Yb)N, b) Eu/Eu* vs. Sr/Nd, c) (La/Yb)N vs. (Gd/Lu)N diagrams for the studied \n\nsamples. \n \n\nThe Middle REEs (MREEs) are more compatible with amphibole and depletion \n\nin MREE, such as Gd, in relation to LREE or HREE is usually associated with \n\namphibole crystallization and removal. Although apatite is also REE compatible, \n\nremoval of this mineral does not fractionate REE.  \n\nAs was stated above, (La/Yb)N ratios are not greatly affected by crystal \n\nfractionation, so deviations from the main trend in the (La/Yb)N vs (Gd/Lu)N diagram \n\n\n\n \n\n214 \n \n\nshould be caused by amphibole accumulation if they plot towards higher values of \n\n(Gd/Lu)N for a certain (La/Yb)N value or by crustal contamination if the opposite is \n\nobserved. The amphibole rich Peninha and Praia Vasco da Gama gabbros in the Sintra \n\nand Sines igneous complexes, respectively, seem to show signs of amphibole \n\naccumulation, while the lower (Gd/Lu)N ratios of the more evolved Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas and \n\nAn\u00e7os sills seem to be related to crustal contamination processes.  \n\n \n\n7.2. Radiogenic Isotope geochemistry \n\nSr and Nd isotope analyses were carried out at the Laborat\u00f3rio de Geologia \n\nIsot\u00f3pica of the Universidade de Aveiro, in collaboration with Prof. Maria do \n\nRos\u00e1rio Azev\u00eado and under the technical supervision of Eng. Sara Ribeiro. Rb, Sr, \n\nSm and Nd contents were previously determined by ICP-MS at Actlabs Ancaster, \n\nOntario, Canada. A 2% error in values given for the concentration of these elements \n\nwas assumed in order to calculate the errors in 87Rb/86Sr and 147Sm/144Nd.  \n\nAll the intervening reagents in the preparation of the samples were distilled by \n\nsub-boilling, and the water produced by a Milli-Q Element (Millipore) apparatus. \n\nThe samples were mostly unaltered, but whenever trace amounts of \n\nsecondary carbonate were present, the powders were leached in 1N acetic acid \n\n(CH3COOH) according to the following method, adapted from Weiss and Frey \n\n(1996): a) the sample is weighed into an acid washed Savillex\u00a9 beaker; b) 10 mL \n\nof 1N acetic acid are added; c) the suspension is ultra-sonicated for 10 minutes; d) \n\nthe supernatant is decanted; e) steps b to d are repeated until reaction stops and the \n\nsupernatant is clear and pale yellow to colorless. In the case of the very altered \n\npillow lavas from the Fontanelas seamount, the amount of carbonate present as a \n\nsecondary phase that replaces igneous minerals or as vesicle fillings was so \n\nsignificant that the powders were leached according to this same procedure, but \n\nwith 2.5 HCl instead of acetic acid. The residue is then thoroughly washed in water \n\nand dried in a hot plate before digestion.  \n\nThe samples were digested at 200 \u00baC during a 3 days period in Teflon Parr? \n\nacid digestion bombs containing 2 mL HF and 1 mL HNO3. Afterwards, the residue \n\nis dried and then redissolved with 3ml HCl 6N in the digestion bombs during 1 \n\nnight.  \n\n\n\n \n\n215 \n \n\nThe elements to analyse were purified using conventional ion chromatography \n\ntechnique. In a first phase, for Sr and REE separation, the samples were dissolved and \n\nloaded in quartz columns containing AG8 50W Bio-Rad cation exchange resin \n\n(200-400 mesh) using HCl 2.5N as eluent for Sr and HCl 6N for REE. After, for Nd \n\npurification, the REE residue is evaporated in a hot plate, redissolved in 0.2 N HCl, \n\nand placed in a smaller quartz column containing Ln Resin (100-150 \u00b5m)\u2013IChroM. \n\nThe isotopic analysis for Sr and Nd were performed on a VG SECTOR 54 \n\nmulticollector Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS). Sr was loaded on a \n\nsingle Ta filament with H3PO4, whereas Nd was loaded with HCl on a Ta outer side \n\nfilament, in a triple filament arrangement. Data were acquired at dynamic mode with \n\npeak measurements at 1-2V to 88Sr and 0.8-1.5V to 144Nd. Sr and Nd isotopic ratios \n\nwere corrected for mass fractionation relative to 88Sr/86Sr=0.1194 and \n146Nd/144Nd=0.7219. This study took place over two years, during which the SRM-987 \n\nstandard gave an average value between 0.7102562 \u00b1 46 (N=23; conf. lim.=95%) and \n\n0.710243 \u00b1 10 and (N=14; conf. lim.=95%) for  87Sr/86Sr, while the 143Nd/144Nd value \nfor the JNdi-1 standard varied between 0.512105 \u00b1 4 (N=18; conf. lim.=95%) and \n\n0.512098 \u00b1 5 (N=14; conf. lim.=95%).  143Nd/144Nd data are normalized to La Jolla \n\nstandard. The average levels of blanks were in the range 0.25-1.0 ng for Sr and 0.5-\n\n1ng for Nd.  \n\nPb isotopic ratios were conducted at the Department of Petrology (FALW), \n\nVrjie Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands, in collaboration with Dr. Jane \n\nChadwick. All samples were treated in the same manner as standards and blanks \n\nusing standard chemical separation techniques (after Pin, 1994). All errors are \n\nreported as 2?. \n\nPrior to dissolution, the samples containing secondary carbonate were \n\nleached with 6N HCl according to the procedure in Weiss and Frey (1996). \n\nLeached samples were then washed with MilliQ water and dried. These and \n\nthe non leached samples, all weighing approximately 200 mg, were then placed in a \n\nTeflon beaker together with 2 mL 40% HF dist. and 0.8 mL conc. HNO3.The \n\nbeakers were then placed on a hot plate at 150 \u00baC for 2-3 days while they were \n\ndisgested. HNO3 was added until the sampled was completely destroyed. The \n\nsample was later dissolved in 6N HCl and left on the hot plate for 2-5 days. \n\n\n\n \n\n216 \n \n\nAfterwards, this solution was split in two identical aliquots, one for the \n\ndetermination of elementar concentrations of Pb, U and Th which was diluted 5000 \n\ntimes in 5% HNO3 and the other for the acquisition of the isotopic ratios.  \n\n0.7 N HBr was later added to the aliquot intended for isotopic analysis in \n\norder to release the Pb. This solution was then centrifuged at 12000 RPM for 4 \n\nminutes, transferred to a C-Tube and then pippeted into previously washed 0.15 mL \n\nglass columns with AGIx8 (200-400 mesh) ion exchange resin, where the Pb \n\nfraction was recovered using HBr and HCl. \n\nElementar Pb, U and Th were analyzed in a Quadrupole Thermo X-Series II \n\nICP-MS. Samples were prepared using a modified version of the method described by \n\nTurner et al. (1999). Detection limits and analytical precision ranged from&lt;100 ppb to \n\n<1 ppt, and relative analytical precision was typically approximately 2 to 5% (one \n\nstandard deviation). See Eggins et al. (1997) for an in-depth description of the method \n\nused. \n\nPb isotopes were analysed by standard\u2013sample bracketing using a Thermo \n\nFinnigan Neptune multi-collector ICP-MS. All analyses were conducted using a \n\nCetac AX-100 autosampler, in combination with a Cetac Aridus nebuliser to \n\nintroduce samples into the MC-ICP-MS. The wash-out time between analyses was 3 \n\nmin, and uptake time 2 min. A total of 5 blocks of 20 cycles were measured, with \n\nintegration times of 4 s per cycle. Levels of 201Hg were always less than 0.05mV. \n\nFor each measurement, the average of the two bracketing machine blanks \n\nwas subtracted before calculation of the Pb isotopic ratios. The blank levels varied \n\nbetween sessions with intensities of 1.5\u20133.0 mV on 208Pb. Variable blank correction \n\nalways introduced fewer uncertainties than the error from counting statistics in the \n\nconcentration range of our solutions.  \n\nA 100 ppb solution of NIST SRM-981 standard gave 16.9367 \u00b1 10, 15.4950 \n\n\u00b1 10 and 36.7147 \u00b1 23 (2?, n= 3) for 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb, \n\nrespectively. The values of Baker et al. (2004) were used for normalisation. For the \n\nBHVO standard, these ratios yielded 18.76084 \u00b1 10, 15.6281 \u00b1 10 and 38.7385 \u00b1 \n\n22 for 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb, respectively (2?, n=2). Full \n\nprocedure Pb blank solutions were in the order of 0.05 ppb, corresponding to 150 \n\npg Pb. Data reduction was done offline, following the formula for sample\u2013standard \n\nbracketing (Albar\u00e8de et al., 2004). The calculation of error propagation was \n\nperformed using relative errors (%). All errors given on Pb isotopic ratios are 2 \n\n\n\n \n\n217 \n \n\nstandard deviations (absolute). A detailed description of the method applied can be \n\nfound in Elburg et al. (2005). \n\n \n\n7.2.1 Introduction \n\nIntraplate continental alkaline magmas have to cross thick continental \n\nlithosphere before they are erupted or emplaced at shallow depths. Therefore, besides \n\ncarrying information about their original source, these magmas can also provide clues \n\nabout the nature of the crust and lithospheric mantle they cut through, as well as \n\ninformation concerning the processes that control their evolution during the ascent to \n\nthe surface. Long-lived radioactive isotopes are powerful tools for such studies, since \n\nthey can be used as tracers for mantle and crustal magma generation, evolution and even \n\nmixing processes.  \n\nIsotope ratios for long lived isotopic reservoir, such as any sort of isolated \n\nvolume of the mantle, are a linear function of their parent/daughter ratio (e.g. Rb/Sr in \n\nthe 87Rb ? 87Sr system) and a nearly linear function of time or geological age of the \n\nsystem. When this mantle domain undergoes equilibrium partial melting, the melt \n\ninherits the isotopic ratio of the entire system. Consequently, radiogenic isotope ratios \n\nare powerful tracers of the parent\u2013daughter ratios of mantle sources of igneous rocks \n\nand of their evolution in time. If isotope data from several other long lived decay \n\nsystems are combined (e.g 147Sm ? 144Nd, 235U ? 207Pb, 238U ? 206Pb, 232Th ? 208Pb \n\netc), a better image of source chemistry and history can be constructed, since different \n\nisotopic systems have different geochemical properties that lead to the development of \n\ndistinct parent-daughter isotope ratios on major reservoirs. For example, Sr and Rb are \n\nboth incompatible, but with ??? &lt;???, and concentrate in mantle melts, \n\nconsequentially the mantle domains affected by magmatic extraction have a low Rb/Sr \n\nratio and evolved towards low 87Sr/86Sr. However, Sm/Nd ratios are higher in the \n\nmantle, while differentiated crustal rocks are enriched in the slightly more incompatible \n\nNd relative to Sm, so the mantle rocks usually show higher 143Nd /144Nd ratios than \n\ncrustal rocks, especially the more differentiated ones, which have low 143Nd /144Nd. In \n\nsummary, most of the differences in isotopic composition are a result of ancient \n\nchemical fractionation events and the consequent time integrated evolution under \n\ndifferent parent/daughter ratios.  \n\n\n\n \n\n218 \n \n\nIt is generally much easier to measure the ratio of two isotopes than the absolute \n\nabundance of one. We therefore measure the ratio of, for example, 87Sr to a non-\n\nradiogenic isotope, which by convention is 86Sr. In this work, these ratios will be used, \n\ntogether with some incompatible trace element ratios, as tracers of mantle sources, \n\ncrust\u2013mantle interaction processes, and mantle melting processes, with the aim of \n\nunderstanding the petrogenesis of the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM. \n\nAnother possible way of representing isotopic ratios is through the Epsilon (?) \n\nnotation, that describes the deviations of several isotopic ratios from the ones attributed \n\nto the Chondritic Uniform Reservoir (CHUR \u2013 an approximation of the isotopic values \n\non the chondritic solar system, before planetary differentiation took place (DePaolo and \nWasserburg, 1976), at the time (t) of rock formation. This value is given by the \n\nfollowing equation: \n \n\n?Nd(t) = [(143Nd/144Nd)sample(t)/ (143Nd/144Nd)CHUR(t)-1] x 10000 \n \n\nEpsilon units usually correspond to larger numbers and are therefore a more \n\neasily understood representation of the initial isotopic ratios, rendering comparisons \n\nbetween different rocks an easier task.  \n\n \n\n7.2.2 Results \n\nThe studied samples show relatively low 87Sr/86Sri (0.703005 to 0.704884) and \n\nhigh ?Ndi (and high 143Nd/144Nd) values (5.8 to2.8) that plot on the depleted quadrant of \n\nthe 87Sr/86Sri vs. ?Ndi diagram (fig. 7.11), showing lower values of 87Sr/86Sri than Bulk \n\nEarth and higher ?Ndi than the CHUR, except for the sample from the Lomba dos \n\nPianos sill that is distinctively more enriched in 87Sr/86Sri. These values suggest a time \n\nintegrated depletion in Rb and Nd relative to Sr and Sm, respectively, which is in \n\ncontrast with the previously mentioned trace element enriched nature of these rocks. \n\nThe majority of the basic samples that do not present any evidence for \n\ncontamination by crustal lithologies show a narrow Sr and Nd isotopic range and plot \n\nmostly between the HIMU and FOZO components (87Sr87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi \n\n5.7 \u2013 3.7, fig. 7.10-11). Meanwhile, some of the more evolved samples (Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas \n\nsill, An\u00e7os sill) and one basic dyke (basalt dyke from Cascais) define a trend towards \n\nmore radiogenic Sr isotopic ratios and lower ?Nd (87Sr/86Sri up to 0.7049 and ?Ndi as \n\nlow as 3.1, fig. 7.10-12), probably as a result of contamination by crustal lithologies.  \n\n\n\n \n\n219 \n \n\nFig. 7.11: Sr-Nd isotopic plot comparing locations representative of different mantle end-member \ncompositions and the Common Mantle Reservoir (CMR, Lustrino and Wilson, 2007) with the Late \nCretaceous intraplate alkaline magmatism of the West Iberian Margin. Data for the ocean island that \nrepresent the different mantle end members from the GEOROC database (http://georoc.mpch-\nmainz.gwdg.de/georoc/). For more information on mantle components, see section 3. \n\n \n\nIt is possible to observe two trends diverging from the central cluster of values \n\n(87Sr/86Sri 0.703-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7-3.7, figs. 7.11-12). One trend is defined by the \n\nMalveira da Serra, Montelevar and Lomba dos Pianos sills and is characterized by an \n87Sr/86Sri increase while ?Ndi remains unaltered. In the second trend, represented by the \n\nPa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas and An\u00e7os sills and one of the Cascais dykes, 87Sr/86Sri increases \n\nsimultaneously as ?Ndi decreases (fig. 7.11-12). These two trends are probably the \n\nresult of contamination by crustal lithologies with different isotopic and trace element \n\nabundances, and will be discussed in more detail later in section 7.3.2. They do not \n\nseem to reflect secondary alteration and the addition of secondary carbonated material \n\nsince the samples were leached with acetic acid, which successfully removed that \n\nsecondary carbonated fraction in the Foz da Fonte and An\u00e7os sills (fig. 7.13).   \n\nA tentative explanation for the observed inconsistency between the enriched \n\ntrace element signatures and depleted Sr and Nd isotopic composition shown by the \n\nLate Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM is that the trace element enrichment of the \n\nsource could be attributed to a mantle metasomatism event that possibly occurred \n\n\n\n \n\n220 \n \n\nshortly before the generation of these magmas, adding incompatible trace elements to \n\nthe source while not affecting its originally depleted isotopic composition. Since this \n\nenrichment took place shortly before magma generation, the source for these rocks did \n\nnot have sufficient time to evolve into a more significantly enriched and heterogenous \n\nisotopic composition. Such a metasomatic agent could have been a liquid derived from \n\nvery low amounts of partial melting from a relatively isotopically depleted reservoir, \n\nsuch as the asthenospheric mantle, or the first melt fractions of an ascending mantle \n\nplume, as is suggested by several authors for other cases of intraplate alkaline \n\nmagmatism (e.g. Niu, 2008; Pilet et al., 2008, 2010; Martins et al., 2010) and seems to \n\nbe supported by mineral chemistry data presented in section 6.2. Evidence provided by \n\ntrace element geochemistry for the existence of metasomatic mantle processes will be \n\ndiscussed in section 7.4. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.12: Sr-Nd isotopic plot comparing the compositions of the CMR, Madeira and Canaries hotspots \nand of the Cenozoic Moroccan and Spanish alkaline intraplate magmatic activity with the Late \nCretaceous intraplate alkaline magmatism of the West Iberian Margin. Data for the CMR, the Madeira \nand Canaries hotspots, Spanish and Moroccan cenzoic magmatism from Lustrino and Wilson (2007). \n \n\nThe samples from the nearby Late Cretaceous Ormonde seamount (? 67 Ma) and \n\nMadeira-Tore Rise (? 80 -100 Ma) show even more depleted Nd isotopic compositions, \n\nwith higher ?Ndi values, but on the other hand show a similar 87Sr/86Sri range (fig. 7.11).  \n\n\n\n \n\n221 \n \n\nIn most cases, the uncontaminated basic Late Cretaceous Alkaline rocks from \n\nthe WIM also plot in the same fields defined by the Common Mantle Reservoir (CMR, \n\na mantle reservoir defined as a common source component for the rocks of the circum-\n\nMediterranean anorogenic Cenozoic igneous province by Lustrino and Wilson, 2007), \n\nthe Canaries mantle plume and Cenozoic alkaline magmatism occurred in Spain.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.13: Sr-Nd isotopic values for the analyzed samples, including the unleached and leached Foz da \n\nFonte, Malveira da Serra and An\u00e7os sills. The leaching process resulted in a significant decrease of \n87Sr/86Sr. \n\n \n\nPb isotopes show 206Pb/204Pbi (18.827-19.564) compositions that are more \n\nenriched than DMM and most of the samples with EM component signatures, but less \n\nenriched than HIMU (figs. 7.14 and 7.15). 207Pb/204Pbi values (15.567-15.634) define a \n\ncompositional array close to the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line (NHRL, a trend \n\ndefined by the basalts from the Mid Atlantic Ridge basalts and ocean islands of the \n\nnorthern Atlantic, Hart, 1984) and EM II (fig. 7.14), while 208Pb/204Pbi (38.603-39.948) \n\nshows values trend close to the NHRL between EM II and HIMU, except for the \n\nsamples from the Fontanelas seamount who show higher 208Pb/204Pbi values. The origin \n\n\n\n \n\n222 \n \n\nof such high 208Pb/204Pbi in the Fontanelas seamount will be addressed in detail in \n\nsection 7.5.2. \n\n \n\nFig. 7.14: Pb-Pb isotopic plots comparing mantle end-member compositions and CMR (Lustrino and \nWilson, 2007) with the Late Cretaceous intraplate alkaline magmatism of the West Iberian Margin.

Data for the CMR, the Madeira \nand Canaries hotspots, Spanish and Moroccan cenzoic magmatism from Lustrino and Wilson (2007). \n\n \n\nThe more basic samples cluster around 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi \n\n15.609-15.580 and 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00 values, along the NHRL. The more \n\n\n\n \n\n224 \n \n\nevolved rocks, along with the gabbros from Sintra and Sines, show Pb isotopic \n\nsignatures that plot progressively away from the NHRL, towards higher 207Pb/204Pbi \n\n(max. 15.634) and lower206Pb/204Pbi (min. 18.827) and 208Pb/204Pbi (min. 38.603), which \n\nis likely to be related to crustal contamination, a process which will be discussed in \n\ndetail in section 7.3.2. \n\nThe basic samples also plot near some samples from the Madeira Tore rise and, \n\nmore consistently, the Ormonde seamount (fig. 7.14 and 7.15). However, the \n\ncompositions of these two submarine features tend to show more enriched Pb isotopic \n\nvalues, including much higher 207Pb/204Pbi.  \n\nThey also fall within the fields defined by the CMR and Canaries hotspots, with \n\nsome of the more evolved samples and gabbros trending towards Pb isotopic \n\ncompositions that plot into the fields defined by other intraplate continental alkaline \n\noccurrences in the region such as the Moroccan and Spanish Cenozoic alkaline \n\nmagmatism (fig. 7.15).  \n\nThis might indicate that similar evolution mechanisms, such as crustal \n\ncontamination, characterized the evolution of the magmas in all these provinces. One of \n\nthe seamounts of the MTR and some of the samples from the Ormonde peak on the \n\nGorringe bank seem to show composition affinities with the samples from the Madeira \n\nhotspot, falling into or near the field they define in the diagrams. \n\nOn the Pb-Sr and Pb-Nd isotopic spaces (figs. 7.16 and 7.17) the studied \n\nsamples also plot in between a more depleted PREMA like reservoir and the high U/Pb \n\nHIMU, near FOZO. Some of the evolved samples show a trend towards EM type \n\ncompositions. These correspond to the more evolved and possibly contaminated \n\nsamples which plot closer to the EM II domain. \n\nSamples from the basic rocks present in the Sines and Sintra complexes show \n\ndistinct behaviors from their basic counterparts in the WIM as is shown by the Pb-Pb, \n\nPb-Sr and Pb-Nd diagrams (figs. 7.14-17). They plot along with the more evolved and \n\npossibly contaminated samples in the Pb-Pb isotopic space and show intermediate \n\ncompositions in the Pb-Sr and Pb-Nd diagrams with more basic and evolved rocks in \n\nthe Pb-Sr and Pb-Nd diagrams.  \n\nComparing our results with the alkaline rocks of similar age present in the region \n\n(fig. 7.17), it is discernible that they show, in general, consistently lower Nd and in most \n\ncases higher Sr isotopic ratios than the nearby Madeira-Tore rise and Ormonde \n\n\n\n \n\n225 \n \n\nseamount for similar 206Pb/204Pb values. Again, the more evolved rocks tend to show \n\nisotopic signatures similar to the ones shown by the Cenozoic alkaline magmatism \n\npresent in Spanish territory. Some of the basic samples plot in the fields defined by \n\nsamples from the Canaries hotspot. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 7.16: 206Pb/207Pb vs. 87Sr/86Sr and 206Pb/207Pb vs. 143Nd/144Nd plots comparing mantle end-member \ncompositions and CMR with the Late Cretaceous intraplate alkaline magmatism of the West Iberian \nMargin. Data for the CMR from Lustrino and Wilson (2007), and for the ocean island that represent the \ndifferent mantle end members from the GEOROC database. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n226 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 7.17: 206Pb/207Pb vs. 87Sr/86Sr and 206Pb/207Pb vs. 143Nd/144Nd plots comparing the compositions of the \nCMR, Madeira and Canaries hotspots and of the Cenozoic Moroccan and Spanish alkaline intraplate \nmagmatic activity with the Late Cretaceous intraplate alkaline magmatism of the West Iberian Margin. \nData for the CMR, the Madeira and Canaries hotspots, Spanish and Moroccan cenzoic magmatism from \nLustrino and Wilson (2007). Legend as in fig. 7.14. \n\n \n\nThese results seem to indicate that the studied rocks originated from a source \n\nwith a Sr  Nd time integrated isotopic depletion, suggesting the involvement of a \n\nsublithospheric source that is slightly more enriched than the asthenospheric mantle \n\nsampled in the Mid Ocean Ridges (DMM component) but with different, less radiogenic \n\ncompositions than the EM and HIMU components. \n\nMeanwhile, the Pb isotopic composition of the same rocks is quite radiogenic \n\nand argues for a source with higher time integrated U/Pb ratios than the depleted \n\nasthenospheric mantle or the EM mantle components.  \n\nThe source for the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM could reside \n\neither in a mantle plume component or at the metasomatized lithospheric mantle. These \n\nhypothesis will be address in more detail in section 7.5. \n\nOne sample from a basaltic dyke in Cascais (RM 64) shows a rather enigmatic \n\nisotopic signature, having higher 87Sr/86Sri  and lower ?Ndi than other basic rocks in the \nregion, while showing similar radiogenic Pb ratios. This could be either due to crustal \n\ncontamination by a more enriched crustal lithology or to a lithospheric contribution \n\nduring the generation of this dyke. This subject will de approached in more detail \n\nbelow.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n227 \n \n\n7.3 Magmatic evolution processes \n\nParental magmas tend to generate more evolved, silica rich liquids through \n\ndifferentiation processes such as fractional crystallization, assimilation/crustal \n\ncontamination and mixing with other melts. \n\nThe influence of these processes in the composition and evolution of the Late \n\nCretaceous Alkaline rocks from the WIM is discussed in this section.  \n\n \n\n7.3.1 Fractional Crystallization  \n\nAs was previously mentioned on the major and trace element characterization of \n\nthe samples, the fractional crystallization and removal and/or accumulation of olivine, \n\nclinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, and in some cases even plagioclase and apatite, seems to \n\nhave had an important role in the evolution of the alkaline magmatic suites observed on \n\nthe West Iberian Margin. \n\nSome of the evidence for the importance of crystal accumulation has already \n\nbeen discussed in the petrographical characterization of the samples (section 6.1) and \n\nduring the geochemical description of the studied samples (sections 7.1 and 7.2). Its \n\neffects are also evident from the observation of figures 7.1-4 and 7.7-10 and generally \n\nresult in marked enrichements or depletions in a certain element that is abundant in a \n\ngiven mineral. Samples are usually enriched in such an element if that mineral has \n\naccumulated in the studied rock or depleted if it has been extensively removed from the \n\nmelt. \n\nAs the rocks sampled in this study have different ages, and are not from a single \n\nintrusion or complex, it cannot be assumed that crystal fractionation affected these \n\nintrusions in the same way, since fractionating assemblages should vary. Therefore, in \n\norder to illustrate the role of crystal fractionation on the variability of the alkaline \n\nmagmas from the WIM, the modeling effort will be concentrated on the LVC and \n\nassociated minor intrusions (see section 2.3), since this complex was more extensively \n\nsampled. \n\nAs was already mentioned, primary rocks are absent in the LVC as well as from \n\nthe other sampled occurrences. This is by itself evidence for the importance of fractional \n\ncrystallization processes in the evolution of the rocks from the WIM, and argues for the \n\nexistence of deeper chambers where fractionation of at least olivine, chromian spinel \n\nand maybe even clinopyroxene and other phases (e.g. amphibole, apatite) took place.  \n\n\n\n \n\n228 \n \n\nIn order to model the crystal fractionation processes in the rocks from the LVC \n\nand try to evaluate the role of this process in the differentiation of these magmas, \n\nsample RM 69 was selected as being representative of the parental composition from \n\nwhich most of the rocks associated with this complex might have evolved. This sample \n\nhas relatively high MgO, Ni and Cr concentrations and Mg# (MgO 9.98 %, Ni 143 ppm, \n\nCr 400 ppm and Mg# 65.1) and shows no signs that its composition was controlled by \n\ncrystal accumulation. Other samples with higher contents in Ni, Cr and MgO can be \n\nfound among the sampled LVC rocks, but their compositions and textures shows \n\nevidence for modification by important crystal accumulation. \n\nThe amount of fractional crystallization of a certain mineral phase or assemblage \n\nnecessary to generate the observed compositional spectrum can be modeled using the \n\nRayleigh law, which describes the case where crystals are removed from the melt \n\ninstantly after crystallization (e.g. Rollinson, 1993). The equation that describes \n\nRayleigh/fractional crystallization is: \n??\n??\n\n= ?(???) \n\n \nWhere Cl is the concentration of an element in the remaining magmatic liquid, C0 is the \n\nconcentration of the same element in the initial magma, F is the remaining melt fraction \n\nand D is the partition coefficient between the crystallizing mineral(s) and the magmatic \n\nliquid.  \n\nThis can be rewritten as: \n\n?? = ??(???)? ?  ?? \n\nThis will give the concentration on an element of known D in the remaining \n\nliquid after a certain amount (1-F) of the fractional crystallization of a given mineral or \n\nmineral assemblage. \n\nK is not a stoichiometric element relatively to any of the minerals thought to \n\nhave fractionated in the LVC, it behaves incompatibly, and does not show much \n\nvariation between samples with a given SiO2 content, so it was chosen to be the \n\ndifferentiation proxy plotted in the X axis of the diagrams used to evaluate the role of \n\nthe fractional crystallization process. \n\nOverall, the evolution of the concentrations for the compatible trace elements \n\n(Ni, Cr, Sc, V) from basanitic to intermediate terms is in agreement with the fractional \n\n\n\n \n\n229 \n \n\ncrystallization of an assemblage of clinopyroxene (55%) + olivine (20%) + plagioclase \n\n(17.5%) + magnetite (7.5%) (fig. 7.18).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.18: Plots of K vs. selected trace elements showing the samples from the LVC and associated \n\nocurrences and the trend defined by the fractionation of an assemblage of clinopyroxene (55%) + olivine \n\n(20%) + plagioclase (17.5%) + magnetite (7.5%). Each tick mark corresponds to 10% increment of the \n\ncrystallized mass. \n\n\n\n \n\n230 \n \n\nSr shows a different behavior, becoming compatible in some of the more \n\nevolved samples, like the An\u00e7os and Montelevar sills. Some of the incompatible trace \n\nelements, such as Rb and Ba, also seem to follow a trend compatible with the fractional \n\ncrystallization of that same assemblage. Still, not all of the samples plot near the \n\nmodeled trend for the more incompatible Zr, La, Nb and Th (fig. 7.18).  \n\nIn some cases this seems to be due to the choice of a relatively enriched initial \n\ncomposition for the parental liquid used in this modeling, since the remaining samples \n\nsometimes appear to define evolution trends parallel to the modeled one. However, the \n\nmore evolved, silica saturated An\u00e7os and Montelevar sills, seem to define  a  different \n\ntrend, oblique to the calculated one, characterized by a less pronounced enrichment in \n\nincompatible trace elements. This implies that fractional crystallization is not the only \n\nmechanism controlling the evolution of this rock suite. \n\nThese results must be regarded with caution and only as giving a general idea of \n\nthe crystal fractionation processes affecting the LVC, as its accurate interpretation must \n\ntake into account: \n\n1) the possible occurrence of distinct parental magmas (mantle source \n\nheterogeneity and/or several distinct melting events); \n\n2) the fact that, as shown before (see section 6), the fractionating phase(s) can \n\nchange during the evolutionary process; \n\n3) the existence of assimilation and contamination processes. \n\nIf we apply the same calculated fractional crystallization trend to the entire data \n\nset in order to encompass all of the studied samples, one can observe the existence of \n\nsimilar trends to the ones identified for the LVC (fig. 7.19), indicating that that these \n\nmagmas might have evolved through the fractionation of relatively similar mineral \n\nassemblages.  \n\nIn fig. 7.19 it is noticeable that the Sr concentration for the An\u00e7os, Montelevar \n\nand especially the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill show a considerable divergence from the main trend \n\nobserved for the evolution of Sr with K, showing a compatible behaviour. To explain \n\nthis change in behavior it is necessary to model the crystal fractionation of a different \n\ncrystal assemblage (fig. 7.19) with with plagioclase (50%), clinopyroxene (30%), \n\namphibole (10%) and magnetite (10%) (green trend in fig. 7.19). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n231 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.19: Plots of K vs. selected trace elements showing all the collected samples and the trend defined \n\nby the fractionation of an assemblage of: (A) clinopyroxene (55%) + olivine (20%) + plagioclase (17.5%) \n\n+ magnetite (7.5%) and (B) plagioclase (50%), clinopyroxene (30%), amphibole (10%) and magnetite \n\n(10%). Each tick mark corresponds to 10% increment of the crystallized mass. \n \n\nIt should be noted that the modeled fractional crystallization curve requires the \n\ncrystallization of nearly 80% of the original basanitic liquid in order to reproduce the \n\n\n\n \n\n232 \n \n\nobserved geochemical evolution (figs. 7.18 and 7.19), which seems to be a very high \n\nvalue and can also be considered as suggestive of the existence of other processes \n\ncontrolling the evolution of these rocks. However, if only the LVC is considered, the \n\nremaining 20% of the liquid are roughly in the same proportion of evolved rocks \n\npresent in this complex.  \n \n\nTable 7.2: Partition coeffiecients (Kd) for the minerals used in fractional crystallization modelling \n\naccording to the data available on GERM database (www.earthref.org, Philpotts and Schnetzler 1970; \n\nPaster et al., 1974; Sun et al., 1974; Matsui et al., 1977; Mysen, 1978; Takashi, 1978; Okamoto, 1979; \n\nShimizu, 1980; Kravuchuk et al. 1981; Villemant et al., 1981; Dostal et al., 1983; Lemarchand et al., \n\n1987;  McKenzie and O\u2019Nions, 1991; Nielsen, 1992; Adam et al., 1993;  Beattie, 1993, 1994; Hart and \n\nDunn, 1993; Dalpe and Baker, 1994; Latourrette et al., 1995;  Esperanza et al., 1997; Zack and Brumm, \n\n1998; Bindeman et al., 1998; Green et al., 2000; Adam and Green, 2006; Aignertorres et al., 2007). \nmineral clinopyroxene olivine amphibole plagioclase magnetite \n\nK 0.0072 0.0056 0.78 0.301 0.045 \nSc 3.62 0.32 1.59 0.04 1.96 \nV 3.1 0.15 3.4 0.1 6.85 \nCr 8.49 1.3 0.1 0.08 153 \nNi 2.6 2.86 16 0.04 31 \nRb 0.011 0.04 0.34 0.058 0.11 \nSr 0.2 0.0000154 0.298 2.536   \nZr 0.123 0.06 0.31 0.003 0.71 \nNb 0.0077 0.01 0.159 0.01 0.01 \nBa 0.22 0.05 0.46 0.183 0.028 \nLa 0.0536 0.00053 0.039 0.065 0.015 \n\nTh 0.012 0.0000024 0.009 0.05 0.1 \n\n \n\nIn summary, fractional crystallization is an important process in the evolution \n\nof the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM, as demonstated by the modeling \n\nof the evolution of the samples associated with the LVC through the crystallization and \n\nremoval of an assemblage of clinopyroxene (55%) + olivine (20%) + plagioclase \n\n(17.5%) + magnetite (7.5%). The remaining samples of the studied Late Cretaceous \n\nalkaline rocks plot close to the line defined by this model but the more evolved terms \n\ndefine a trend that is oblique to the obtained fractional crystallization curve. This and \n\nthe some elemental and isotopic characteristics of the more evolved samples suggest \n\nthat, besides fractional crystallization, these rocks should have been under the influence \n\nof other processes during their evolution, such as crustal contamination. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n233 \n \n\n7.3.2 Crustal Contamination \n\nThe absence of samples that might correspond to primary magmatic liquids \n\namong the basic alkaline rocks of the WIM argues for the occurrence of stagnation in \n\nmagma chambers and important fractional crystallization before these magmas reached \n\nthe upper crustal levels.  \n\nSuch a setting is also compatible with a scenario where crustal rocks or melts \n\ncan be assimilated or mixed with the ascending magmas, contaminating the mantle \n\nmelts and changing their isotopic and trace element signature, since stagnation and \n\ncrystallization of basic magmas will provide the country rock with the heat necessary \n\nfor its fusion and subsequent mixing with the basic magmas (e.g. DePaolo et al., 1981; \n\nReiners et al., 1995; Spera and Bohrson, 2001; Bohrson and Spera, 2001). This \n\nhypothesis is addressed below. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.3.2.1 Trace element and isotopic evidences for contamination \n\nThe most obvious indication for the existence of crustal contamination as an \n\nimportant petrogenetic process is the variation of the isotopic ratios with increasing \n\nsilica, i.e. with magmatic evolution. In fig. 7.19a-e it is visible that 87Sr/86Sr and \n207Pb/204Pb increase, but 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb decrease with \n\nincreasing SiO2. This is a strong indicator for increasing assimilation of siliceous crustal \n\nmaterial with continuing crystallization. \n\nSome samples, however, show high 87Sr/86Sr and relatively unchanged ?Ndi and \n\nPb isotopic ratios while having low SiO2 contents (Lomba dos Pianos and Malveira da \n\nSerra sills and a basaltic dyke from Cascais, see also figs 7.11 to 7.13), which argues for \n\nthe existence of another type of possibly SiO2-poor contaminant. \n\nAlthough none of the analyzed samples shows Nb and Ta negative anomalies \n\nwhich are classic indicators of contamination by crustal material, which is depleted in \n\nthese elements (Rudnick and Gao, 2003), the observed increase in Th/La, Zr/Nb and \n\nK/Nb towards values closer to crustal compositions with increasing SiO2 (fig. 7.20) \n\ncannot be explained by fractional crystallization processes alone, which would result on \n\nthe persistence of the same values for incompatible trace element ratios from basic to \n\nacid terms. Thus, the input from a contaminant with higher Zr/Nb, Th and K and lower \n\n\n\n \n\n234 \n \n\nLa and Nb than the original magmas is required to cause an increase of these ratios with \n\nmagmatic evolution. \n\nThe continental crust has higher Th/La (Upper Continental Crust 0.34; Lower \n\nContinental Crust 0.15; Rudnick and Gao, 2003), Zr/Nb (UCC = 16.1; LCC 13.6; \n\nRudnick and Gao, 2003) and K/Nb (UCC = 1937; LCC 1012; Rudnick and Gao, 2003) \n\nand is the most likely contaminant of these magmas. \n\nNb/U decreases with increasing silica (fig. 7.21) to values below those \n\nassociated with oceanic ocean island basalts linked to mantle plumes or the \n\nasthenosphere (47 \u00b1 10; Hoffman et al., 1986), which is also in agreement with \n\ncontamination of these samples by crustal lithologies with lower Nb/U (UCC = 4.44; \n\nLCC 25.0; Rudnick and Gao, 2003).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.20: Plots of SiO2 vs. isotopic ratios showing changes with increasing silica contents. \n\n \n\nSome samples have higher Nb/U than ocean basalts (fig. 7.21), probably due to \n\nthe removal of U during alteration by aqueous fluids since most of these high values \n\noccur in the Sintra, Sines and Monchique intrusive complexes, where late hydrothermal \n\nalteration is observed, or in the extensively seawater altered pillow lavas of the \n\nFontanelas Seamount. \n\n\n\n \n\n235 \n \n\nThe higher contents in HREE, low values of (Gd/Lu)N (fig. 7.10,) and flatter \n\nHREE profiles (fig. 7.9) discussed in section 7.1.2 also argue for significant crustal \n\nassimilation in the more evolved samples, especially the sills of intermediate \n\ncomposition.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.21: Plots of SiO2 vs. Th/La, K/Nb, Zr/Nb and Nb/U for the studied samples. The more SiO2 rich \n\nsamples show progressively higher Th/La, K/Nb and Zr/Nb and lower Nb/U reflecting the progressive \n\ncontamination of these rocks by crystal lithologies. See text for discussion. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n236 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.22: Plots of trace element ratios Th/La, K/Nb, Zr/Nb and Nb/U vs. isotopic ratios of the analyzed \n\nsamples. See text for discussion. \n\n\n\n \n\n237 \n \n\nIncreasing Th/La, K/Nb and Zr/Nb, and decreasing Nb/U also correlate with \n\nincreasing 87Sr/86Sri (fig. 7.22), which is in accordance with the contamination of the \n\ninitial basic magmas by a crustal lithology with high time integrated Rb/Sr. \n\n?Ndi values decrease with increasing Th/La and with decreasing Nb/U but show \n\nmore complex relations with K/Nb and Zr/Nb, hinting that there might be some \n\nheterogeneity in the composition of the contaminants that were assimilated by these \n\nmagmas (fig. 7.22). \n\nThe Pb isotopic composition of these rocks evolves towards less radiogenic \n206Pb/204Pbi and 208Pb/204Pbi compositions with increasing Th/La, K/Nb and Zr/Nb and \n\ndecreasing Nb/U. 207Pb/204Pbi shows the opposite behavior, increasing towards higher \n\nTh/La, K/Nb and Zr/Nb and lower Nb/U (fig. 7.21). The high 207Pb/204Pb suggests that \n\nthis crustal contaminant is quite old due to its enrichement in 207Pb. This is because the \n\nhalf life of 235U is relatively short (235U ? 207Pb 0.7038 x 109 a) when compared with \n\nthe half life of 238U (238U ? 206Pb 4.468 x 109 a), so high 207Pb coupled with low 206Pb \n\nvalues must have been generated relatively early in the Earth\u2019s history, when 235U was \n\nmore abundant.  \n\nFrom the data presented above, the more contaminated rocks seem to correspond \n\nto the intermediate sills (An\u00e7os, Montelevar, Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas), with the diorites from the \n\nSintra and Sines igneous complex and the Cascais dykes (including basaltic sample \n\nRM64) also showing evidence for some crustal contribution to their composition (figs. \n\n7.20 and 7.21). \n\nThe samples from the Sintra and Sines igneous complexes deserve special \n\nattention since they have higher 207Pb/204Pbi and lower 206Pb/204Pbi and 208Pb/204Pbi than \n\nthe other basic samples and are an exception to the general observed variations, showing \n\napparently contaminated Pb isotopic ratios but relatively uncontaminated trace element, \n\nNd and Sr isotope signatures (figs. 7.14-15 and 7.20-22).  This could  mean that  the  Pb \n\nisotopic signatures either reflect the contamination by a lithology with similar Sr and Nd \n\nisotopic signatures but distinct Pb isotopic ratios or that the contaminated Pb signature \n\nin these rocks might be  an   artifact  created  by  the  secondary  hydrothermal   \n\nalteration  that  affected  these intrusions (see section 6.1). Since Pb is present in low \n\nconcentrations in the rocks of the alkaline complexes (3.1-4.7 ppm), but high \n\ntemperature, Cl rich hydrothermal fluids might show high contents in Pb (e.g. Simonetti \n\nand Bell, 1994), it is possible that the hydrothermal fluids might have introduced \n\nsignificant radiogenic Pb. It is possible that the Pb and a portion of the hydrothermal \n\n\n\n \n\n238 \n \n\nfluids originated from within the surrounding sedimentary rocks which could contain \n\nmore radiogenic lead. However, it is necessary that these fluids contained significantly \n\nless Sr and Nd than the Sintra and Sines gabbros, so that hydrothermal alteration at low \n\nwater:rock ratios (<&lt;1) resulted in unchanged Sr and Nd isotopic ratios (e.g. Tepley \n\nand Davidson, 2003) while being responsible for a more contaminated isotopic Pb \n\nsignature.  \n\nAlternatively, this secondary process might simply have resulted in changes in \n\nthe U/Pb and U/Th ratios, leading to inadequate correction for U decay and incorrect \n\ninitial Pb isotopic ratios. U, along with Pb, could have been leached from the rock \n\nduring the hydrothermal alteration phase, while less mobile Th should have remained \n\nunaltered. However, the simultaneous changes in all the Pb isotopic ratios and the low \n\nmeasured 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb and high 206Pb/204Pb suggest this is not the most \n\nlikely case. \n\nRecapitulating, the data indicate that most of the more evolved terms in the \n\nanalyzed rocks interacted with a crustal contaminant rich in SiO2, Th, K, 87Sr/86Sr and \n207Pb/204Pb, but depleted in La, Nb, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb.  \n\nA smaller group of samples, represented by the Lomba dos Pianos, Malveira da \n\nSerra and Montelevar sills, seems to have assimilated a contaminant with high 87Sr/86Sr \n\nbut which apparently contained low amounts of Nd and Pb, since the isotopic ratios of \n\nthese elements do not appear to have been affected by this event.  \n\n \n\nThe samples displaying the stronger indications of contamination (the more \n\nevolved sills and dykes present in the Lisbon region, as well as the diorites from the \n\nSintra and Sines complexes, figs. 7.19-21) intrude the Mesozoic siliciclastic, carbonate \n\nand evaporitic sediment cover of the Lusitanian basin (e.g. Kullberg, 2000) in the upper \n\ncrust and had to cut through  the Ossa Morena zone mafic to felsic plutons and \n\nmetassediments of the middle and lower crust (Capdevila and Mougenot, in Boilot and \n\nWinterer (eds.), 1988). The contaminants assimilated by the studied rocks are most \n\nlikely to correspond to either acid igneous rocks or metassediments in the Paleozoic \n\nOssa Morena Zone (OMZ) and/or sediments in the Lusitanian Basin (LB) that either \n\nresulted from the erosion of lithologies in the OMZ and Central Iberian Zone (CIZ) or \n\nfrom precipitation of carbonate from Mesozoic Atlantic waters. The contaminant can \n\nalso be a mix of sediments from the different Paleozoic terranes, and therefore show \n\n7.3.2.2 Quantifying crustal contamination by AFC \n\n\n\n \n\n239 \n \n\ndifferent signatures in accordance to the proportion in which each of these terranes are \n\nrepresented. \n\nAssimilation of crustal rocks can take place simultaneously with fractional \n\ncrystallization, in a mechanism known as Assimilation and Fractional Crystallization \n\n(AFC, DePaolo, 1981). The equation that describes the behavior of trace elements \n\nduring such a processes was derived by DePaolo (1981) and corresponds to: \n\n \n??\n??\n\n= ?? +\n?\n\n? ? ? + ?\n?  ??/??(? ? ??) \n\nwhere ?? , ?? and ?? correspond to the concentration of a trace element in question in \n\nthe residual melt, the parental liquid and the assimilant, respectively. D is the bulk \n\ndistribution coefficient for that same element, r the ratio of the assimilation rate to the \n\nratio of the crystallization rate and ?? is given by: ?? =  ??(???+?)/(???), where F is the \n\nfraction of melt remaining. \n\nThe evolution of isotopic ratios during such a process is also described by \n\nDePaolo (1981) and given by the following equation: \n\n??\n? = ??\n\n? + ??? ? ??\n?? ? (? ? ?\n\n??\n?\n\n??\n? ? ??) \n\nwhere ??\n?,  ??\n\n? and ?? ,  are the isotopic ratios of the residual melt, of the parental magma \n\nand of the contaminant, respectively. ??\n? is the  concentration of  the trace element \n\nwhose isotopic ratios is being addressed in the parental magma while ??\n? is the \n\nconcentration of that same element in the contaminant. \n\nThese equations allow the modeling of the behavior of trace elements and \n\nisotopic ratios during AFC but are rather simplistic, assuming constant distribution \n\ncoefficients and assimilation to crystallization ratios for the entirety of the process, \n\nwhich is unrealistic. They also fail to integrate any estimate of the volume of crustal \n\ncontribution and disregard the thermal constrains of the AFC process, which is a serious \n\nflaw since the energy to heat and melt the country rock comes from the intruding \n\nmagma and its crystallization, and is therefore a function of its composition (e.g. \n\nReiners et al., 1995; Spera and Bohrson, 2001; Bohrson and Spera, 2001). \n\nSeveral possible contaminants were used to test if they fitted the evolution trend \n\nof the geochemical signatures of the more contaminated rocks in the West Iberian \n\nMargin, namely metassediments and granitoids from both the OMZ and CIZ, and \n\ncarbonates from the LB.  \n\n\n\n \n\n240 \n \n\nThe compositions of these contaminants are averages of the existing analysis \n\nfrom rocks belonging to each of the different Paleozoic terranes (OMZ \n\nmetassediments: Borrego, 2009; Chamin\u00e9 et al., 2000; Chichorro et al., 2008; Pereira \n\net al., 2006; 2007; OMZ granitoids: Brand\u00e9s et al., 2004; Chichorro et al., 2008; \n\nLopez-Guijarro, et al., 2008; Moita et al., 2009; Montero et al., 1999; Pereira et al., \n\n2007; Pin et al., 2008; Priem et al., 1986; CIZ metassediments: Bea et al., 2003; \n\nUgidos et al., 1997 Lopez-Guijarro, et al., 2008; CIZ granitoids: Antunes et al., 2007; \nAzevedo and Nolan, 1998; Casquet et al., 2001; Dias et al., 2002; Gomes and Neiva, \n\n2005; Martins et al., 2009; Neiva et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2000; Vale Aguado et al., \n\n2006; Villaseca et al., 1998; 2009); the isotopic composition of the Lusitanian basin \n\ncarbonates was calculated using the Nd and Sr isotopic composition values for the \n\nAtlantic seawater (McArthur et al., 2001; Stille et al., 1996) while their elementar Sr \n\ncomposition was assumed to correspond to an average Phanerozoic carbonate (Condie, \n\n1991) and for Nd and other trace elements, a composition corresponding to the average \n\nof the values reported in Plank and Langmuir (1998) and Gao et al. (1998).  \n\nThe effect of AFC processes in the Pb isotopic signature of the studied rocks \n\nwas not evaluated due to the lack of data for any of the possible contaminants. \n\nAlso, the composition of the contaminant(s) for rocks with such a wide \n\ngeographical distribution and showing different modes of occurrence is expected to be \n\nisotopically heterogeneous and so the models presented here are only indicative of \n\npossible scenarios that could have occurred during the evolution of the Late Cretaceous \n\nalkaline magmas of the WIM. \n\nThe results yielded by this method, using the D values as the ones indicated in \n\ntable 7.4 and an r value of 0.3, which is approximately the value calculated by Taylor \n\n(1980) for a typical upper crustal case, are displayed in fig. 7.23. \n\nThey show that some of the more enriched isotopic and trace element signatures \n\ncan be obtained by assimilation of a crustal rock with a composition similar to the one \n\nfound in the metassediments of the OMZ, along with the ? 40% crystallization of the \n\nsame paragenesis modeled in for fractional crystallization (see section 7.3.1). However, \n\nthe Sr-Nd signatures of the samples with lowest 144Nd/143Nd as well as those that show \n\nboth high 144Nd/143Nd and 87Sr/86Sr cannot be reproduced by assimilation of such a \n\nlithology. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n241 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.23: 87Sr/86Sr vs. 144Nd/143Nd, Sr vs. 87Sr/86Sr and Nd vs. 144Nd/143Nd diagrams for the studied \n\nsamples with the lines of compositional variation for the AFC modelling of several different \n\ncontaminants. Each of the marks in the contamination lines represents a 0.1 increase in F or a 10% \n\ndecrease in the remaining melt fraction. See text for discussion. \n\n \n\nThe other tested contaminants seem to be unable to replicate the observed \n\ncompositional features, producing changes in 87Sr/86Sr that are not accompanied by the \n\nnecessary decrease in 144Nd/143Nd to in order to generate isotopic signatures similar to \n\nthe ones observed in the alkaline rocks of the WIM. \n\n \n\nThe equations that allow the modeling of the behavior of trace elements and \n\nisotopic ratios during AFC are rather simplistic, assuming constant distribution \n\ncoefficients and assimilation to crystallization ratios for the entirety of the process, \n\nwhich is unrealistic. They also fail to integrate any estimate of the volume of crustal \n\ncontribution and disregard the thermal constrains of the AFC process, which is a serious \n\n7.3.2.2 Quantifying crustal contamination by EC-AFC \n\n\n\n \n\n242 \n \n\nflaw since the energy to heat and melt the country rock comes from the intruding \n\nmagma and its crystallization, and is therefore a function of its composition (e.g. \n\nReiners et al., 1995; Spera and Bohrson, 2001; Bohrson and Spera, 2001). \n\nEnergy Constrained Assimilation and Factional Crystallization (EC-AFC; Spera \n\nand Bohrson, 2001) is an alternative method to model the AFC process that self \n\nconsistently balances thermal energy conservation, species and mass while also tracking \n\ncompositional variations generated in the anatetic melt as country rock undergoes \n\npartial melting. It integrates the the effects of energy conservation and country rock \n\npartial melting into the geochemical evolution of an open system magma reservoir, \n\neffectively linking them (Bohrson and Spera, 2001).  \n\nThis kind of model allows for the rate of assimilation and composition of the \n\nanatetic melt produced by the fusion of crustal material to change with time, as the \n\ntemperature of the country rock increases by heat transfer from the magma and with the \n\nheat produced during crystallization (Bohrson and Spera, 2001), thus creating a more \n\nrealistic approach than traditional AFC models that only account for mass, species and \n\nchemical variations at a fixed assimilation rate (DePaolo, 1981). However, EC-AFC \n\nmodels use fixed magma-mineral distribution coefficients which means that these are \n\nconstant during the entire melt evolution, which is still not realistic. \n\nThe EC-AFC calculations were done using an Excel spreadsheet provided by \n\nSpera and Bohrson (2001). The thermal and geochemical input parameters used in the \n\nmodeling of EC-AFC at upper crustal conditions are displayed in tables 7.3 and 7.4 and \n\nthe results on figs 7.24-25. The EC-AFC process is deduced to have occurred in the \n\nupper crustal levels since the most contaminated samples correspond to the more \n\nevolved sills, which were emplaced into the upper crust. As such, the thermal \n\nparameters are the same as those used for a standard upper crustal case in Bohrson and \n\nSpera (2001), except for the carbonate assimilant which are from Chadwick et al. \n\n(2007).   \n\nAs the observed magmas all show evidence for the existence of some fractional \n\ncrystallization prior to emplacement, the compositional parameters for the initial \n\nparental magma have been modified so that they can represent a more primitive, \n\nunfractionated composition. This composition maintains the same average Sr/Nd ratio \n\nof the WIM\u2019s basic rocks which will allow for some fractional crystallization to take \n\nplace, releasing energy and heat to the country rock before the trace element values \n\nreach unrealistically high values in the modeled EC-AFC curves. \n\n\n\n \n\n243 \n \n\nThe initiation of assimilation of the wall rock is strongly dependent on thermal \n\nparameters such as the initial wall rock temperature (Ta), which can be highly variable, \n\nso in order to simulate a wider range of natural conditions, the calculations for the EC-\n\nAFC model were done for several values of Ta. \n\n \nTable 7.3: Thermal parameters used for EC-AFC modeling. \n\nMagma liquidus \ntemperature 1280 \n\nIsobaric specific \nheat of magma 1484 J/kg K \n\nMagma initial \ntemperature 1280 \n\nIsobaric specific \nheat of assimilant  1370 J/kg K \n\nAssimilant liquidus \ntemperature \n\n900 (siliceous) \n800 (carbonates) \n\nCrystallization \nenthalpy 396000 J/kg \n\nAssimilant initial \ntemperature 300 (a); 400 (b) \n\nFusion enthalpy \n(silicates) 270000 J/kg \n\nSolidus temperature 900 Fusion enthalpy (carbonates) 250000 J/kg \n\nEquilibration \ntemperature 950 \n\n  \n    \n\n \nTable 7.4: Compositional parameters used for EC-AFC modeling. \n\n  Sr  (ppm) bulk Sr D0 87Sr/86Sr Nd  (ppm) bulk Nd D0 143Nd/144Nd \nInitial Magma \ncomposition 540 0.6 0.7033 30.0 0.1 0.51282 \n\nCarbonates from the \nLusitanian Basin 350 0.7 0.7075 10 0.1 0.51202 \n\nZOM granitoids 306 1.2 0.7241 22 0.1 0.51209 \nZOM metassediments 114 1.2 0.7175 31 0.1 0.51196 \nZOM S\u00e9rie Negra \nmetassediments 150 1.2 0.7350 31 0.1 0.51195 \n\nZCI granitoids 144 1.2 0.7468 36 0.1 0.51222 \nZCI metassediments 152.8 1.2 0.7345 40.5 0.1 0.51199 \n\n \n\nAs can be observed in fig. 7.24, for a contaminant with an initial temperature of \n\n300 \u00baC (Ta = 300 \u00baC), typical of upper crustal conditions (Bohrson and Spera, 2001), the \n\nEC-AFC trends defined by the OMZ granitoids could explain the isotopic signature of \n\nthe basaltic Cascais dyke with the assimilation of ? 2% of such a contaminant, but after \n\nan unrealistic 94% crystallization of the initial liquid. In its turn, the assimilation of ? \n\n2% of the S\u00e9rie Negra metassediments from the OMZ could generate the isotopic \n\nsignature observed in the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sample with the lowest 143Nd/144Nd. However, \n\nthis would occur at the same unrealistic 94% crystallization of the initial melt. Also, \n\n\n\n \n\n244 \n \n\nnone of these contaminants can reproduce the evolution of Sr and Nd concentrations in \n\nthe liquid, since assimilation only takes place very late in the crystallization history. \n\nAssuming a higher Ta of 400 \u00baC, the Mesozoic carbonated contaminant shows a \n\nbetter fit with the observed magmatic evolution of the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of \n\nthe WIM. The assimilation of approximately 6-10% of carbonate country rock is \n\nrequired in order to explain the observed signatures, after 62-68% of crystallization of \n\nthe original basic magma. The assimilation of such a component also agrees with the \n\nobtained trace element data.  \n\nFor the same Ta value, none of the other possible siliceous contaminants can \n\nprovide a good fit for the observed data, especially on the Nd vs. 143Nd/144Nd and Sr vs. \n\n87Sr/86Sr   diagrams (fig. 7.24). Since fusion temperatures and enthalpies are higher for \n\nsiliceous rocks, more fractional crystallization has to take place before the silicated \n\ncountry rock receives enough energy to reach its fusion temperature. As a consequence, \n\nand since Nd and Sr are incompatible, the modeling process produces higher contents in \n\nthese elements through fractional crystallization. This also means that 143Nd/144Nd and \n87Sr/86Sr values will only start changing late in the crystallization history, when the \n\ncountry rock is provived with enough energy to melt, and such timing corresponds to \n\nvery high Nd and Sr concentrations. \n\nStill, if only the evolution in the isotopic compositions is considered, the \n\nassimilation of 0.6% granitoids from the OMZ could be responsible for the isotopic \n\nsignature of the basaltic dyke from Cascais (fig. 7.24). The incorporation of less than \n\n3% of a contaminant with an isotopic signature close to the CIZ granitoids or OMZ \n\nS\u00e9rie Negra metassediments could generate the isotopic signature of the An\u00e7os sill and \n\nmaybe even the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill (fig. 7.24). Yet, this would only take place after over \n\n90% crystallization of the initial liquid, which again seems too high for the generation \n\nof intermediate rocks.  \n\nHowever, if higher initial assimilant temperatures are considered, the amount of \n\nnecessary heat transfer from fractional crystallization would be smaller and the \n\ndescribed curves in the element vs. isotope diagrams would probably show a better fit \n\nwith the actual data.This can happen at higher depths in locations where long lived \n\nmagmatism and/or extension are taking place, causing the heat flux to be higher than in \n\nstable regions (e.g. Jung et al., 2006; Chadwick et al., 2007), and consequentially \n\nincrease the geothermal gradient in the area. This will mean that temperatures at mid to  \n\n\n\n \n\n245 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.24: 87Sr/86Sr vs. 144Nd/143Nd, Sr vs. 87Sr/86Sr and Nd vs. 144Nd/143Nd diagrams for the studied \n\nsamples with the lines of compositional variation for the EC-AFC of several different contaminants. The \n\ndisplayed numbers correspond to the percentage of mass of wall rock melt, with the amount of fractional \n\ncrystallization that has occurred in brackets. See text for discussion. \n\n\n\n \n\n246 \n \n\nlower crustal depths can be as high or higher than 800 \u00baC (Sachs and Hansteen, 2000; \n\nJung et al., 2006). \n\nFor Ta = 800\u00ba C (fig. 7.25) the modeled trace element evolution seems to show a \n\nbetter fit with the observed data. Assimilation of siliceous contaminants starts at more \n\nreasonable amounts of crystallization (? 43%), however, the isotopic signatures of the \n\ncontaminated melt do not show a good fit with the data, showing a large decrease in \n143Nd/144Nd for small increases in 87Sr/86Sr (fig. 7.25). \n\nThe lack of a good fit between the EC-AFC models and the data obtained for the \n\nLate Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM can also be due to the poorly constrained \n\ntrace element and isotopic composition of their contaminants. These can include \n\nsiliciclastic sediments combining clasts from all of the Paleozoic terranes, and possibly \n\neven sediments containing mixes of silicate clasts in carbonated cement matrixes whose \n\nisotopic signatures should be more diverse than the simple averages presented on table \n\n7.4. \n\nNevertheless, when compared to the carbonates, the siliceous contaminants \n\nwould require the addition of smaller amounts of material to the initial liquid in order to \n\nproduce the isotopic and trace element signatures observed in the more contaminated \n\nsamples given their more radiogenic Sr and empoverished Nd isotopic signatures and \n\nhigher contents in incompatible elements. This makes them more likely candidates to \n\nproduce this contaminated trend than a carbonated assimilant. Also, the assimilation of \n\nexclusively carbonate material does not explain the variations in 87Sr/86Sr and \n143Nd/144Nd with increasing SiO2. \n\nThe assimilation of the high amounts of carbonate, as suggested by the models \n\n(10-16%), would also lead to more undersaturated, CaO rich magmas (e.g. Barnes et al., \n\n2005; Martins et al., 2008) and the more contaminated samples in the WIM show, in \n\ngeneral, the lowest CaO contents while simultaneously being the more silica saturated \n\nrocks present in the region, as well as the only ones showing normative quartz (0.14-\n\n6.1% in the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas, An\u00e7os and Montelevar sills) which does not favor carbonate \n\nassimilation, but still allows the possibility of the existence of a carbonated siliciclastic \n\ncontaminant. \n\nAll this favors contamination of the more evolved WIM alkaline magmas by a \n\nsiliceous contaminant or at least for a major contribution from such a contaminant that \n\nmay or not have a carbonate matrix. Since the studied rocks intrude sediments derived \n\nfrom the erosion of the siliceous OMZ and CIZ terranes, these sediments seem to be the \n\n\n\n \n\n247 \n \n\nmost likely contaminants, although fusion would have to be initiated earlier than in our \n\nEC-AFC models, which can be achieved either by lowering the fusion temperature of \n\nthe assimilant (e.g. by adding volatiles) or by raising the assimilant\u2019s initial temperature. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.25: 87Sr/86Sr vs. 144Nd/143Nd, Sr vs. 87Sr/86Sr and Nd vs. 144Nd/143Nd diagrams for the studied \n\nsamples with the lines of compositional variation for the EC-AFC of several different contaminants. The \n\ndisplayed numbers correspond to the percentage of mass of wall rock melt, with the amount of fractional \n\ncrystallization that has occurred in brackets. See text for discussion. \n \n\nThe different contamination trend observed in the samples from the Malveira da \n\nSerra, Lomba dos Pianos and Montelevar sills is characterized by high 87Sr/86Sr and \n143Nd/144Nd moving the samples towards the enriched quadrant (figs. 7.11-12 and 7.22-\n\n24). Yet the basic Lomba dos Pianos and Malveira da Serra sills do not show any \n\n\n\n \n\n248 \n \n\nevidence for the existence of crustal contamination in their trace element signatures, \n\nalthough the intermediate Montelevar sill plots along the other contaminated samples \n\n(figs. 7.12, 7.23-25).  \n\nSuch a trend was not reproduced using any of the modeled assimilants, so it \n\nmust have originated from a different contaminant, enriched in radiogenic Sr but either \n\nwith a Nd isotopic signature similar to the one shown by the parental magmas to these \n\nsills or having very low Nd contents, meaning that the assimilation of such a material \n\nwould not significantly affect the magma\u2019s original 143Nd/144Nd value. This contaminant \n\ncould correspond to a carbonate with low Nd concentrations or to a melt resulting from \n\nincongruent fusion of igneous or sedimentary rocks containing Rb and Sr rich phases \n\nsuch as biotite and feldspar. The fusion of such minerals would generate a melt enriched \n\nin radiogenic Sr but poor in Nd, driving up the Sr isotopic signature, but leaving \n143Nd/144Nd unaffected. \n\nThe Lomba dos Pianos sill contains what appear to be plagioclase xenocrysts, it \n\nis possible that these might have crystallized from a magma with higher 87Sr/86Sr and \n\npossibly even lower 143Nd/144Nd values than the parental melts of the studied rocks. \n\nHowever, since Sr/Nd ratios in plagioclases are usually high (???\n???? >  ???\n\n????, \n\nBindeman et al., 1998) and these minerals can carry a significant amount of Sr, their \n\npresence could shift the whole rock composition towards high 87Sr/86Sr while leaving \n143Nd/144Nd and other trace elements relatively unaffected.  \n\nOn the other hand, this hypothesis requires that the plagioclase xenocrysts derive \n\nfrom disagregated wall rock assemblages, or from the mixing of liquids with different \n\ncompositions. In the latter case, the parental and contaminating magmas would have \n\nhomogenized and consequentially originated a hybrid isotopic signature. Since both the \n\nLomba dos Pianos and Malveira da Serra sills show evidence for magma mixing, this \n\ncould be a reasonable explanation for the existence of this isotopic trend, but it still does \n\nnot explain why other rocks that show evidence for magma mixing do not show similar \n\nisotopic signatures, and cannot explain the higher 87Sr/86Sr of the Montelevar sill, since \n\nthere is no evidence that points towards the existence of magma mixing in the \n\npetrogenesis of that sill.  \n\nIn summary, the more evolved, intermediate rocks of the WIM show evidence \n\nof contamination by a siliceous, Th, K, 87Sr/86Sr and 207Pb/204Pb rich, but La, Nb, \n143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb depleted assimilant.  \n\n\n\n \n\n249 \n \n\nAnother trend, materialized by the Lomba dos Pianos, Malveira da Serra and \n\nMontelevar sills is characterized by an increase in 87Sr/86Sr and unchanged Nd and Pb \n\nisotopic signatures might be the result of the assimilation of carbonate material or an \n\nincongruent melt from Rb and Sr rich phases. \n\nThe apparently contaminated Pb isotopic signatures of the Sintra and Sines \n\nigneous complexes are likely to be the result of secondary hydrothermal alteration by Pb \n\nrich fluids. \n\nThe comparison between the AFC and EC-AFC models is hindered by the lack \n\nof knowledge concerning the composition of the contaminants and also by the high \n\nnumber of assumptions that had to be made in relation to the thermal parameters used \n\nfor the EC-AFC models. Although EC-AFC seems to be a more complete and realistic \n\nmethod, integrating energy conservation with compositional parameters, the lack of \n\navailable data for both these types of parameters can be a handicap while interpreting \n\nthe obtained results. On the other hand, the more simplistic AFC curves also fail to \n\nreproduce most of the observed contamination trends.  \n\n \n\n7.3.3 Magma mixing \n\n Magma mixing between an ultrabasic to basic and a more evolved, \n\nphonotephritic to tephrophonolitic alkaline melt was proposed in order to justify the \n\npresence of reversely zoned zone clinopyroxenes, amphiboles and plagioclase in some \n\nof the studied intrusives (e.g. the Malveira da Serra and Lomba dos Pianos sills, the \n\nRibeira d\u2019Ilhas plugs, the lavas from the Fontanelas seamount and the Loul\u00e9 \n\nlamprophyre C-20, section 6.2.6). \n\n Given the basic to ultrabasic nature of the rocks that appear to have gone \n\nthrough magma mixing events (38 &lt;SiO2% &lt;46.7), the amount of intermediate alkaline \n\nliquid that mixed with the ultrabasic to basic magma must have been very small.  \n\n The range of compositions shown by liquids resulting from the mixing and \n\nhomogenization of different proportions of two distinct components can be easily \n\nmodeled as binary mixing, using the following equation (e.g. Faure, 1986): \n\n?? = ?? ? ? + ?? ? (? ? ?) \n\nwhere ??, ?? and ?? are the concentration of element X in the mixed melt (m) and in \n\nthe components a and b, respectively, while ? is the proportion of the component a in \n\n\n\n \n\n250 \n \n\nthe mix (e.g. if ?=0.3 there is 30% of component a to 70% of component b in the mixed \n\nliquid). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.26: Plots of SiO2 vs. several major and trace elements for the studied basic rocks. Also plotted are \n\nthe binary mixing lines between basic and intermediate alkaline magmas. Each of the tick marks \n\ncorresponds to an increase of 10% of a component in the mix. See text for discussion. \n \n\nModeling was done using two end member compositions for either a and b, \n\nsince the rocks that appear affected by this process range from ultrabasic lamprophyres \n\nin the Algarve region and hawaiites such as the Lomba dos Pianos sill. So binary \n\nmixing was calculated between a liquid with a composition equivalent to lamprophyre \n\nC-12-1(a1) and an intermediate rock from Monchique (b1) with a tephriphonolite \n\n\n\n \n\n251 \n \n\ncomposition (sample b629). Binary mixing between basanite RM 69 (a2) and \n\nphonotephrite RM 46 from the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill (b2) was also carried out. \n\nConsequently, if binary mixing was an important mechanism in the petrogenesis \n\nof the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM, the Malveira da Serra and Lomba dos \n\nPianos sills, the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plugs, the lavas from the Fontanelas seamount and the \n\nLoul\u00e9 lamprophyre C-20 would have to plot along the calculated mixing lines. \n\nNonetheless, the results do not seem to reproduce the data obtained for the \n\nsamples in a coherent manner for either major and trace elements (fig. 7.26), suggesting \n\nthat either these were the wrong end members to use in the mixing modeling or that the \n\nprocess does not influence the major and trace element signature of these rocks. \n\nIn summary, the relative unimportance of binary mixing as a petrogenetic \n\nprocess in the WIM seems to be supported by the lack of any linear trends forming \n\namong the samples that show traces of mixing, as would be expected if this process was \n\nof higher relevance (e.g. Geldmacher et al., 1998; Meade et al., 2010). This means that \n\nthe assimilation and fractional crystallization processes are of much higher importance \n\nin the evolution of the studied rocks. \n\n \n\n7.4 Magma generation and partial melting processes \n\nGiven the evidence presented above (section 7.1), it seems that the basic rocks in \n\nthe Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic cycle of the WIM were generated by melting of \n\nan enriched mantle source, which is likely to contain garnet and other minor residual \n\nphases in addition to olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. In this section the \n\nnature, melting extent, composition and mineralogy of this mantle source is evaluated.  \n\nSince none of the samples fulfill the criteria needed to be considered primary \n\nmantle melts (Mg# > 68, Ni > 320 ppm, Cr > 1000 ppm, cf. Frey et al., 1978), only the \n\nsamples with a more primitive character and that showed only minor or no traces of \n\nfractionation were used (Mg# > 60, Ni > 50).  \n\n \n\n7.4.1 Residual mantle mineralogy \n\n \n\n7.4.1.1 Characterization of residual mantle mineralogy \n\n\n\n \n\n252 \n \n\nIn fig. 7.27 we can observe several anomalies in the Primitive Mantle \n\nnormalized multielemental diagrams for the more primitive rocks of the Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline cycle of the WIM. \n\nThe most striking features are the previously mentioned negative K, P, Zr and Hf \n\nanomalies, but careful observation of this diagram reveals negative anomalies in Sr for \n\nthe Fontanelas seamount as well as small positive anomalies of the same element in \n\nsome of the rocks from the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic activity. \n\nThe Loul\u00e9 dyke also shows a negative Ti anomaly, while some of the LVC\u2019s rocks and \n\nthe Foz da Fonte sills show a small spike in this same element. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.27: Primitive upper mantle normalized (Palme and O\u2019Neill, 2003)  multielemental plots for the \n\nprimary samples. \n \n\nThis type of anomalies can be caused by fractionation and accumulation of \n\nphases rich in these elements or originate from the buffering of the elemental \n\nconcentrations by a residual mantle phase during melting events. As in most of these \n\nmagmas, the main fractionating phases are olivine and clinopyroxene, which do not \n\ncontain significant amounts of K, Sr, Zr and Hf, these anomalies should be related to the \n\nresidual mineralogy present in the mantle at the time of melting. \n\n\n\n \n\n253 \n \n\nIt is therefore necessary to propose the presence of a K-rich residual mantle \n\nphase in order to explain the depletion in K relative to other similarly incompatible \n\nelements (e.g. Th, Nb, La) when normalized to primitive mantle values, resulting in the \n\nnegative K anomalies observed in most of the basic rocks from the second pulse of Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline activity in the WIM (75-72 Ma, Miranda et al., 2009, this study).  \n\nNb, Y and K behave incompatibly during the melting of a nominally anhydrous \n\nmantle, and their concentrations should decrease with increasing amounts of partial \n\nmelting of the source, becoming less enriched in the melt as a consequence of mass \n\ndilution with increasing amounts of fusion. This can be seen for Y and Nb in fig. 7.28 \n\nwhere, if identical source compositions are assumed, it is possible to propose that the \n\nLoul\u00e9 lamprophyres were the result of smaller amounts of partial melting while the \n\nrocks from the LVC and Fontanelas seamount derived from higher degrees of melting. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.28: Plots of Nb vs. Y and K/Nb for the primitive samples. \n \n\nAssuming that DNb ? DK and similar source compositions for all of the samples, \n\nK/Nb should consequentially remain constant during melting of such an anhydrous \n\nperidotitic source. However, in anhydrated mantle assemblage, K rich phases such as \n\namphibole and phlogopite can be present, and K becomes more compatible than Nb, \n\nwhich is reflected by lower K/Nb ratios in the liquids generated from such a mantle and \n\nin the decreasing K/Nb values with decreasing degrees of partial melting (Class et al., \n\n1998).  \n\n\n\n \n\n254 \n \n\nPrimitive rocks from the WIM show low K/Nb values (110 \u2013 303) when \n\ncompared to the primitive mantle (442, Palme and O\u2019Neill, 2003). Also, K/Nb seems to \n\nincrease with increasing amounts of partial melting since K becomes more incompatible \n\nwith the increasing melting degree, which can be associated with decreasing amounts of \n\nthe K bearing mineral in the source (fig. 7.28). \n\nThis residual K rich phase could correspond to either amphibole (K richterite, \n\nkaersutite or pargasite) or phlogopite, which are common accessory phases in \n\nmetassomatized mantle xenoliths (see Pearson et al., 2003 and references therein) and \n\ncan fractionate incompatible elements such as K, Ba and Rb. \n\nK is more compatible in amphibole with relation to Rb (??\n???? > ???\n\n????; \n\nLaTourette et al., 1995), contrary to phlogopite (??\n?????<?\n\n?????; LaTourette et al., \n\n1995, Foley et al., 1996). So given that in the spidergram of fig. 7.27 and on fig. 7.29 K \n\nseems to be more compatible than Rb, and that the Rb usually shows higher primitive \n\nmantle normalized values than K, the residual K rich phase is likely to be an amphibole. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.29: plot Rb vs. K for the primitive samples. \n \n\nIn addition, during melting events Ba and Rb will behave differently if either \n\namphibole or phlogopite are present as residual phases, given that Ba and Rb are \n\ncompatible with respect to phlogopite (???\n????? = 4.1-3.1; ???\n\n????? = 7.5-5; Adam and \n\n\n\n \n\n255 \n \n\nGreen, 2006) but moderately incompatible in amphibole (???\n???? = 0.26-0.19; ???\n\n???? = \n\n0.26-0.1, Adam and Green, 2006). \n\nConsequently, the incompatible behavior of Ba, which decreases with decreasing \n\nNb and partial melting degree, and the scattered values for Rb, Ba/Nb and Rb/Nb ratios \n\nwith varying Nb contents (fig. 7.30) once more suggest that amphibole, rather than \n\nphlogopite, is the most likely residual K bearing phase, as these ratios are fractionated \n\nby the presence of residual phologopite during low degrees of melting (le Roex and \n\nLanyon, 1998) and should increase with increasing melting degree and decreasing Nb. \n\nDepletion of Zr, Hf, and Ti (fig. 7.27) relative to the middle REE elements (Sm, \n\nEu, and Gd) also cannot be explained by partial melting of dry garnet peridotite, given \n\nthat the bulk partition coefficients for Zr, Hf, and Ti between garnet peridotite and \n\nsilicate melt  are similar to the ones shown by MREE  (Salters et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.30: plots of Nb vs. Ba, Rb, Ba/Nb and Rb/Nb for the primitive samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n256 \n \n\nThe negative anomalies in Zr and Hf observed in most of the basic samples from \n\nthe second cycle of alkaline activity (fig. 7.30) are associated with ZrHf* below 0.75 \n\n(where ZrHf* is defined by (Zr+Hf)N/(Nd+Sm)N, Tappe et al., 2006) which corresponds \n\nto the minimum value associated with samples from the first cycle, who do not show \n\nnegative Zr and Nb anomalies. The lowest ZrHf* values are found in the Loul\u00e9 dykes \n\nand basic rocks from Monchique (0.37-0.46), all of which have lamprophyric affinities, \n\nand also in the amphibole rich gabbroic rocks from the Sintra and Sines intrusions \n\n(0.27-0.44).  \n\nOther basic rocks belonging to the LVC and associated dykes and sills show less \n\npronounced Zr and Hf anomalies and consequently higher ZrHf* (0.51-0.76), while the \n\nmore evolved and contaminated sills and dykes show no Zr and Hf anomaly and some \n\nof the highest ZrHf* (0.78-0.94). \n\nThe negative Zr and Hf anomalies, and consequentially low ZrHf* values, in \n\nbasic and ultrabasic rocks do not appear to be related with crustal contamination \n\nprocesses or with crystal fractionation, since the samples, excepting the Loul\u00e9 dyke, do \n\nnot show any coupled variations in ZrHf* and other HFSEs, like Nb, Ta and Ti, which \n\ncould be indicative of crustal contamination processes, or of the fractionation and \n\nremoval of a Ti rich oxide. \n\nTherefore these anomalies are considered to be primary features of these \n\nmagmas, and associated with specific source characteristics at the time of melting. The \n\naforementioned decoupling of the variations in Zr and Hf with other HFSEs in most of \n\nthe samples also excludes the retention of these elements in a residual Ti rich oxide \n\nphase in the mantle such as rutile and ilmenite, since these minerals would fractionate \n\nall HFSE elements (McCallum and Charette, 1978; Zack and Brumm, 1998; Foley et \n\nal., 2000; Klemme et al., 2005). This means that it is possible that a Ti free, Zr and Hf \n\nrich phase existed in the mantle at the time of melting.  \n\nThe more common Zr and Hf bearing phases observed in xenoliths and as \n\nxenocrysts are baddeleyite (e.g. Heaman and LeCheminant, 2001) and zircon (e.g. \n\nKinny and Dawson, 1992; Konzett et al., 1998). Seeing that these low ZrHf* values are \n\nassociated with lower than unity (Th/Nb)n ratios, the negative Zr and Hf anomalies can \n\nbe indicative of the presence of residual mantle zircon instead of baddeleyite, since the \n\nZr-site in zircon has a wider size than in baddeleyite and as such can incorporate some \n\nTh, leading to (Th/Nb)n &lt; 1 in the magmas, while Th/Nb)n >  1 would be indicative of \n\nthe presence of  baddeleyite (Kerr et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n \n\n257 \n \n\nThe fractionation or presence of residual perovskite in the mantle can be called \n\nupon to justify the negative Ti anomaly in the Loul\u00e9 dyke. This anomaly is coupled with \n\nlower Zr/Nb and higher La/Nb (Nb and Zr are also compatible in perovskite: ???\n??? = \n\n10-0.69; ???\n??? = 15-2.06; ???\n\n??? = 10-1.07 Kato et al., 1988; Liebske et al., 2005; see \n\nfig. 7.31).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.31: Plots of Nb vs. Zr and La/Nb vs. Zr/Nb for the more primitive samples. \n\n \n\nPerovskite is a common phase in ultrabasic carbonated magmas (e.g. Rock, \n\n1977; B\u00e9dard, 1994; le Roex and Lanyon, 1998; Riley et al., 2003; Tappe et al., 2004), \n\nsuch as the volatile rich and carbonate bearing lamprophyres, but it has not been \n\nidentified in the samples from the Loul\u00e9 lamprophyres (see section 6.1.9). This phase \n\nhas only rarely been recognized in mantle xenoliths (e.g. Lloyd et al., 1996; Chesley et \n\nal., 1999; Arzamastsev and Mitrofanov, 2009). However, the identification of this \n\nmineral in mantle material appears to have been wrongly attributed at times, according \n\nto Neal et al. (2001). Thus it seems more likely that the Ti anomaly is not related with \n\nresidual perovskite or with the early crystallization and removal of this mineral. \n\n \n\nAmphibole and zircon, as well as other phases such as phlogopite, apatite, \n\nmonazite, ilmenite, rutile, are common accessory phases in mantle xenolith assemblages \n\nthat have suffered carbonatitic metassomatism in many continental alkaline provinces \n\n(e.g. Rudnick et al., 1993; Yaxley et al., 1998; le Roex and Lanyon, 1998; Gorring and \n\n7.4.1.2 On the nature of the metasomatic agent \n\n\n\n \n\n258 \n \n\nKay, 2000; Tappe et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2010). Negative anomalies in K, P, Zr, Hf \n\nand Ti in basic and ultrabasic alkaline rocks have also been associated with the \n\nmetassomatic action of carbonatitic liquids (e.g. Zeng et al., 2010), and experimentally \n\ndetermined partition coefficients between peridotite and carbonatite melts imply that the \n\ncarbonatites are depleted in these elements (e.g. Sweeney et al., 1995; Klemme et al., \n\n1995; Blundy and Dalton, 2000). Rudnick et al. (1993) associated the decrease in the \n\nTi/Eu ratio with increasing La/Yb of peridotites, and in the magmas generated from \n\ntheir partial melting, with the occurrence of carbonatitic metasomatism. As can be seen \n\non fig. 7.31, Ti/Eu seems to decrease on the studied samples with MgO > 7, with some \n\nof them showing values lower than the one attributed to the primitive mantle (7901, \n\nPalme and O\u2019Neill, 2003).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.32: Ti/Eu vs. La/Yb and Zr/Hf for the samples with MgO > 7. The values for primitive mantle \n\nratios are from Palme and O\u2019Neill (2003). \n \n\nCarbonatitic metasomatism can promote the stability of Ca-rich grossular \n\ngarnets (Pf\u00e4nder et al. 2007; Martins et al., 2010) which have  ???\n??? > ???\n\n??? > 1 (van \n\nWestrenem et al., 2001) consequentially causing lower Zr/Hf ratios in magmas \n\ngenerated from sources metasomatized by carbonatitic liquids containing grossular. \n\nHowever, in the majority of cases, relatively high Zr/Hf (36.2-47.9 in the studied \n\nsamples), above the ratio shown by the primitive mantle (? 36, Palme and O\u2019Neill, \n\n2003), coupled with the lower Ti/Eu values (fig. 7.32) and high La/Yb are interpreted as \n\na fingerprint of the action of carbonatite metasomatism (e.g. Dupuy et al., 1992; Ionov \n\n\n\n \n\n259 \n \n\net al., 1993; Rudnick et al., 1993; Yaxley et al., 1998; Tappe et al., 2007; Zeng et al., \n\n2010).  \n\nFrom the observation of figure 7.32 it is also noticeable that the Foz da Fonte \n\nsill, which formed during the first pulse of Late Cretaceous igneous alkaline activity, \n\ndoes not appear to have suffered the effects of carbonatite metasomatism, which is \n\nexpected since the metasomatic trace element signature is only present in samples from \n\nthe second pulse.  \n\nThe combination of the increase in Ti/Eu and decrease in Zr/Hf with decreasing \n\nTh (fig. 7.33) and increasing degree of melting indicates that the carbonatite \n\nmetasomatized mantle is preferentially sampled in the initial stages of melting, as \n\nanticipated, since carbonation lowers the solidus of mantle peridotite. Consequentially, \n\nthe carbonated mantle domains will melt before anything else and the metasomatic \n\nsignature of the resulting melts will be more evident for melting events characterized by \n\nlow degrees of melting (see also Mata, 1996; Mata et al., 1998). As the degree of \n\nmelting increases, unmetasomatized parts of the mantle can start to melt and the \n\ncarbonatitic signature becomes progressively diluted within increasing contributions \n\nfrom non metasomatized domains to the magma. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.33: Plots of Th vs. Ti/Eu and Zr/Hf for the samples with MgO > 7%. \n\n \n\nThe imprint of a metasomatic event by a carbonatite liquid can by itself generate \n\nthe observed trace element patterns, with its negative anomalies in K, P, Zr, Hf and \n\nsometimes even Ti, but it can also lead to the formation of the minerals previously \n\n\n\n \n\n260 \n \n\nidentified as being responsible by the retention of these elements, for example \n\namphibole (e.g. Kinny and Dawson, 1992; Yaxley et al., 1998, Zaccarini et al., 2004). \n\nThe crystallization of zircon can also be associated with mantle carbonate given that \n\nzircons found in MARID (Mica, Amphibole, Rutile, Ilmenite and Diopside) xenoliths \n\nappear to have formed from interaction with carbonated and K rich silicic liquids \n\n(Kinny and Dawson, 1992; Sweeney et al., 1993; Konzett et al., 1998, 2000; Dawson et \n\nal., 2000). \n\nThe melting of carbonated peridotite will at first generate carbonatitic melts, but \n\nthe nature of the generated liquids will progress gradually towards silica undersaturated \n\nsiliceous compostions with increasing melting degree (e.g. Thibault et al., 1992; Hirose, \n\n1997; Gudfinnsson and Presnall, 2005; Dasgupta et al., 2007).  \n\nSilicate and carbonate liquids can be found in close association in some mantle \n\nxenoliths (e.g. Yaxley et al., 1991; Neumann et al., 2002; Martins et al., 2010). In some \n\ncases, mixtures of these two liquids can occur as silicic carbonatite or carbonate bearing \n\nsilicate melts (e.g. Neumann et al., 2002; Sisson et al., 2009). Therefore, it is likely that \n\nthe source rocks for the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism in the WIM underwent \n\nboth carbonated and siliceous metasomatism, similarly to what has been proposed by \n\nDixon et al. (2008) for the rejuvenated stage lavas of Niihau in Hawaii. Also, the \n\nmetasomatic episodes involving carbonated melts are likely to be volumetrically \n\nrestricted due to the consumption of the small volumes of carbonatitic liquid during \n\nmetasomatic decarbonation reactions (e.g enstatite 4MgSiO3 + dolomite CaMg(CO3)2 = \n\nforsterite 2Mg2SiO4+ diopside CaMgSi2O6 + 2CO2; Yaxley, 1991). \n\nPilet et al. (2008) have recently proposed and alternative mechanism for the \n\ngeneration of enriched undersaturated alkaline rocks, involving volatile rich (H2O+CO2) \n\nbasic alkaline siliceous liquids metasomatizing the lithosphere and forming hornblendite \n\nand hornblende clinopyroxenite veins (e.g. Coltorti et al., 2004; Pilet et al., 2008). In \n\nfact, experiemental work has shown that the partial melting of such metasomatic veins, \n\nalong with interacting and additional melting of the surrounding peridotite, can be \n\ninvoked to explain the major and trace element trace element concentrations of basic \n\nundersaturated alkaline magmas with compositions ranging from nephelinite to alkali \n\nbasalt (fig. 7.36, Pilet et al., 2008, 2010).  \n\nThose results can also reproduce most of the features observed in spidergrams \n\ncommon in this type of magmas and found on the studied rocks (negative anomalies in \n\nK, P, Zr and Hf and pronounced enrichments in LREEs and Nb, fig. 7.34), except for \n\n\n\n \n\n261 \n \n\nthe negative anomaly in Ti and low Ti/Eu values found in the Loul\u00e9 lamprophyre and in \n\nother ultrabasic to basic intraplate alkaline provinces (e.g. Tappe et al., 2004, 2006; \n\nAndrokinov and Foley, 2002; Zeng et al., 2010). This is because the magmas generated \n\nby this kind of source are very Ti rich, given the large amounts of Ti bearing amphibole \n\npresent in the source. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.34: Primitive upper mantle normalized (Palme and O\u2019Neill, 2003)  multielemental plots for the \n\nmore primitive samples of the WIM and for the experimental melts obtained from hornblendite and \n\nhornblendite + peridotite sources by Pilet et al. (2008). \n \n\nOther possible sources for alkaline magmatism, including silica deficient \n\ncarbonated eclogite and garnet pyroxenite, have also been proposed as possible sources \n\nfor basic alkaline magmas, but the melts produced from these sources are generally too \n\npoor in alkalis (Hirschman et al., 2003; Kogiso et al., 2003; Kogiso and Hirschman \n\n2006) and cannot explain the negative Ti anomalies and high Zr/Hf ratios commonly \n\nobserved in these magmas (Zeng et al., 2010) and in some of the Late Cretaceous \n\nalkaline rocks studied in this work. \n\nIn summary, trace element abundances and ratios point towards a metasomatic \n\nenrichment of the source of the alkaline magmatism present in the WIM. The \n\n\n\n \n\n262 \n \n\ncomposition of such a metasomatic agent is likely to be gradational, from a carbonatitic \n\nto a volatile rich siliceous melt. However, the high Zr/Hf and low Ti/Eu point towards \n\nan important carbonatitic contribution. Carbonatite and silicate melts possess different \n\nmelt structures, owing to having ???\n??and O2- as the main coordinating or complexing \n\nanion (Klemme et al., 1995; Blundy and Dalton, 2000) and will therefore show different \n\nbulk distribution coefficients for certain elements (see also Martins et al., 2010). \n\nExperimental studies show that carbonatite melts show marked depletions in Ti in \n\nrelation to LREE and MREE, resulting in low Ti/Eu (e.g. Klemme et al., 1995; \n\nDasgupta et al., 2009). On the other hand, D values for Ti between garnet peridotite and \n\nsilicate melts are similar to the ones shown by MREE (Salters et al., 2002) and generate \n\nhigher Ti/Eu, as the ones seen in experimental results by Pilet et al. (2008). \n\nOverall, high Zr/Hf and low Ti/Eu are diagnostic of an important carbonatitic \n\ncomponent in the metasomatic agent that affected the source of some of the Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM, resulting in the imprint of its trace element \n\nsignature in the metasomatized mantle. \n\nEvidence seems to point to carbonatitic and volatile rich (H2O+CO2) siliceous \n\nliquids, both of which can be generated progressively by decompression melting of a \n\ncommon, ascending carbonated peridotite (e.g. Gudfinnsson and Presnall, 2005; \n\nDasgupta et al., 2006). As these two kinds of metasomatic agents have been previously \n\nidentified in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (e.g. Dautria et al., 1992; Woodland \n\net al., 1996), it is likely that they could have both acted in the mantle underneath the \n\nWest Iberian Margin producing heterogenous mantle domains. \n\n \n\nThe presence of metasomatic residual amphibole is not compatible with the \n\ntemperature conditions that characterize the convecting asthenosphere or associated \n\nwith mantle plumes (e.g. Class and Goldstein, 1997), which implies that the magmas \n\nwith negative K anomalies were at least in equilibrium with cooler, amphibole bearing \n\nlithospheric mantle. \n\n7.4.1.3 Asthenospheric vs. Lithospheric contributions: constraints from residual mantle \n\nmineralogy \n\nHowever, the unradiogenic Sr and radiogenic Nd isotopic signature of these \n\nmagmas is compatible with a sublithospheric source. This depleted signature contrasts \n\nwith the observed trace element enrichment and indicates that the source must have \n\nbeen subject to a metasomatic event which took place shortly before the generation and \n\n\n\n \n\n263 \n \n\nemplacement of these alkaline magmas, not giving them time to evolve into distinct \n\nisotopic signatures by radioactive decay as a reservoir separated from the convecting \n\nasthenosphere. The nature of this asthenospheric or lithospheric mantle source will be \n\ndiscussed in further detail in section 7.5. \n\nIt should be noted that the nature of the lithospheric mantle in the WIM can \n\nnevertheless be quite similar to the underlying asthenosphere.  \n\nAs was previously discussed, rifting in the Lusitanian basin ended before the \n\nonset of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism (e.g. Rasmussen et al., 1998; \n\nKullberg, 2000; Kullberg et al., 2010). After the continental break-up and the initiation \n\nof seafloor spreading, the lithosphere and asthenosphere will return to thermal \n\nequilibrium (e.g. Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004). The thermal anomalies induced by the \n\nupwelling asthenosphere during rifting will decay and stabilize to 65% of their \n\nmaximum intensity after 60 Ma in the case of mantle plumes. For margins where \n\namagmatic rifting took place, such as WIM, that value is reached in shorter amounts of \n\ntime (Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004). \n\nThis means that by the Late Cretaceous, which is approximately 25 Ma after the \n\nend of rifting and oceanic break-up (at 124-118 Ma, e.g. Sibuet et al., 2007), the \n\nlithosphere of the newly formed passive West Iberian Margin could have been \n\nconstituted by a mix of previously existing Paleozoic subcontinental lithosphere with \n\nMesozoic asthenosphere accreted by conductive cooling. Subsequently, in the Late \n\nCretaceus the lower part of the lithosphere in the WIM should then have a Mesozoic age \n\nand show chemical characteristics similar to the depleted convective asthenosphere (e.g. \n\nWilson, 1993). \n\nLater, during the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle, this relatively young \n\nlithospheric domain could be the site of metasomatism by carbonated and hydrated \n\nsilicated melts derived from low degrees of melting of a carbonated peridotite \n\neventually present in the asthenosphere or in an upwelling mantle plume, similarly to \n\nwhat is proposed by Dasgupta et al. (2006) for oceanic settings. However, the thicker \n\ncontinental lithosphere would prevent the formation of the more silica rich melts \n\nproduced in the spinel stability field that are sampled in oceanic areas with a thinner \n\nlithosphere. It would only allow for the generation of liquids resulting from small melt \n\nfractions at higher depths, and consequentially in equilibrium with stable garnet. These \n\nincompatible element enriched low degree melts would react with the lithosphere and \n\nform discrete veins that might contain amphibole, zircon and other metasomatic \n\n\n\n \n\n264 \n \n\nminerals, and also have a lower solidus than the surrounding lithosphere due to their \n\nhydrated and/or carbonated nature.  \n\nThese veined domains could therefore be easily fused during a subsequent event, \n\nand the enriched melts generated by their fusion could mix with more depleted liquids \n\nresulting from the partial melting of the asthenosphere or surrounding lithosphere, \n\ncreating the observed trace element and isotopic signatures. The metasomatic \n\ncomponent in the final signatures, will be more or less evident depending on the \n\nproportion of melt generated from metasomatic material and from the more depleted \n\nasthenosphere in the final melt. \n\nHowever, this later melting event had to be triggered by a thermal perturbation \n\nof the lithosphere, either by the arrival of hotter mantle from a plume or convecting cell \n\nor by adiabatic decompression associated with lithospheric extension. As the WIM was \n\nnot under extension during the Late Cretaceous, the first option seems the more likely. \n\nThe mineral chemistry data for the xenocrysts and xenoliths presented on section \n\n6.2 can be used as evidence for the presence of clinopyroxene, amphibole and apatite \n\nrich domains that could be a result of mantle metasomatism by silicic carbonated liquids \n\nin the subcontinental mantle lithosphere (e.g. Pilet et al., 2005; O\u2019Reilly and Griffin, \n\n2000). However, the pressure and consequentially the depth at which those minerals \n\nformed is still fairly unconstrained and one cannot argue without reasonable doubt that \n\nthese processes took place in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle or in the lower \n\ncrust. \n\n \n\n7.4.2 Estimates for the degree of melting \n\nEven though all of the studied samples are of alkaline nature and share some \n\ncompositional affinities (see section 7.1), the variability detected in terms of trace \n\nelement and even isotopic signatures indicates that the source of this Cretaceous \n\nalkaline event cannot be considered to be homogeneous. This must be taken into \n\naccount when reading the next discussion, where source homogeneity can be implied. \n\nEven if such an assumption is not strictly correct, the common characteristics \n\nshown by the studied samples are thought to validate the following discussion, in a \n\nsense that the results obtained are suitable at least for comparison purposes. \n\nThe relative amount of mantle partial melting that occurred in order to form the \n\nmore primitive WIM magmas can be estimated by plotting a very incompatible element, \n\n\n\n \n\n265 \n \n\nsuch as Th, versus a ratio of two other incompatible elements (e.g. Sm/Nd, Hf/Th) with \n\nthe less incompatible of the two as the numerator. These very incompatible elements \n\n(Th, Nd) have very high affinities with the liquid and are enriched in small melt \n\nfractions in comparison to the other less incompatible elements. As the degree of \n\nmelting of the source increases, concentration of the very incompatible elements will \n\ntend to decrease as they become more diluted in the melt.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.35: Plot of Th vs. Hf/Th and Sm/Nd for the samples that represent more primitive magmas. Th \n\ndecreases and incompatible trace element ratios increase with increasing amounts of partial melting of the \n\nsource. \n\n \n\nFrom fig. 7.35, we can suggest that the Loul\u00e9 lamprophyric dyke is the result of \n\nthe smallest amount of partial melting, while basalts from the LVC and Fontanelas \n\nseamount, the Foz da Fonte sill, the Cascais dykes and the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug all seem \n\nto be the product of similar, higher amounts of partial melting. \n\nThese conclusions are supported by fig. 7.36 where the Loul\u00e9 dyke shows the \n\nhigher La, La/Yb and Tb/Yb, in accordance with an origin from small degrees of partial \n\nmelting, which progressively increases towards the rocks from the LVC, Fontanelas \n\nseamount, Foz da Fonte sill and Cascais basaltic dyke. \n\nGarnets have high D for HREE (e.g. Adam and Green, 2006), and since all the \n\nmore primitive samples show a strong REE fractionation, as was observed in fig. 7.9, \n\nwith the samples having high LREE/HREE ((La/Yb)N 49 \u2013 15.4) and MREE/HREE \n\nfractionation ((Tb/Yb)N 3.1 \u2013 2.7) ratios, it is considered that melting took place in the \n\npresence of residual garnet.  \n\n\n\n \n\n266 \n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.36: Plots of La vs. La/b and La/Yb vs. Tb/Yb for the samples that represent primary magmas. F is \n\nthe degree of partial melting of the mantle source. It increases with decreasing La/Yb and La. \n \n\nAs a mantle peridotite phase, garnet is stable at depths higher than 60 km where \n\nit occurs along with spinel up to 70 km and as the only Al rich phase from that depth \n\nonwards (e.g. Shen and Forsyth, 1995), meaning that the depth of melting for the \n\nalkaline rocks of the WIM was at least 60 km and likely higher.  \n\nAlso, in fig. 7.36 it is observed that La and La/Yb, as well as Tb/Yb decrease \n\nwith increasing degree of melting. La and Tb become more diluted in melts that result \n\nfrom higher partial melting fractions and furthermore because the amount of residual \n\ngarnet in the mantle also decreases as the mineral is consumed during fusion, leading to \n\na decrease of Yb retention in residual garnet and consequentially to lower La, La/Yb \n\nand Tb/Yb values. \n\nThe amount of partial melting taking place at the source of a certain magmatic \n\nevent can also be quantitatively determined using the variation of the concentration of \n\nincompatible trace elements with increasing amounts of melting.  \n\nIn this case, modeling was done using equilibrium batch melting. Batch or \n\nequilibrium batch melting assumes that the melt is continually reacting and equilibrating \n\nwith the solid residue until extraction from the source takes place, and provides good \n\nresults when compared to other mantle melting models (e.g. Feingenson et al., 1996; \n\nSpath et al., 2001). The equation that governs such a behavior was determined by Shaw \n\n(1970): \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n267 \n \n\n??\n?\n\n???\n=  \n\n?\n?? + ?(? ? ??)\n\n \n\n \n\nwhere ??\n?  is the concentration of element i in the magmatic liquid, ???  is the \n\nconcentration of the same element in the source rock, F is the amount of partial melt \n\nand ?? the bulk distribution coefficient between the residual solid and the magma \n\n(??? = ??\n???????? \u00d7 ????  ?). \n\n In order to account for different melt contributions from the individual solid \n\nmineral phases in proportions that are different from the ones in which they are present \n\nin the source assemblage, the batch melting equation was rewritten as follows by Shaw \n\n(1970): \n\n??\n?\n\n???\n=  \n\n?\n?? + ?(? ? ?)\n\n \n\nwhere P is the bulk distribution coefficient for the minerals that contribute to the melt \n\n(? = ??? \u00d7 ??, where ?? is the normative weight fraction of a certain mineral in the \n\nmelt and ?? is the mineral-melt distribution coefficient for a given trace element for \n\nthat same mineral). \n\nREEs were used to constrain the amounts of partial melting that took place in the \n\nsource of the more primitive WIM magmas (Mg# > 60, Ni > 150). Since chondrite \n\nnormalized patterns for REEs are strongly dependent on source composition and \n\nmineralogy, as well as on the degree of partial melting of that same source, the shape of \n\nthose patterns will be controlled by the occurrence of phases whose presence is in its \n\nturn controlled by pressure/depth, such as spinel and garnet (e.g. Ellam, 1992; Kerr, \n\n1994).  \n\nOnly the more primitive and uncontaminated magma compositions were used \n\nfor the elaboration of these models since these went through minimal amounts of \n\nfractional crystallization and therefore their REE concentrations have not been \n\nsignificantly affected by this process. For this reason the basaltic dyke from Cascais \n\n(sample RM 64) had to be left out of the process, since it appears to have been \n\ncontaminated by crustal material (see section 7.3.2), although it is a fairly basic and \n\nundifferentiated rock. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n268 \n \n\nTable 7.5: D values for the REE elements used for equilibrium batch melt modeling.

All these \n\nsources are LREE enriched and contain residual garnet. Amphibole was present in the \n\nmodeled sources 1, 2 and 3 but not 4 since this last source was used to model the Foz da \n\nFonte sill where residual amphibole is not supposed to be present.  \n\nThe results indicate that the ultramafic Loul\u00e9 lamprophyres are derived from \n\nvery low amounts of partial melting (1-2%) of a more REE enriched source, with higher \n\namounts of residual garnet and amphibole (fig. 7.37).  \n\nThe source for the remaining Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the second pulse \n\nof magmatism present in the WIM is less REE enriched, contains smaller amounts of \n\ngarnet and amphibole (table 7.6) and requires higher amounts of partial melting (3-6%) \n\nin order to generate the observed REE patterns in these samples.  \n\nThe REE contents of the basaltic Cascais dyke (RM 64) cannot be modeled \n\nusing any of these sources and would require an even more depleted source, with \n\ndifferent melting modes (fig. 7.37).

Given the relatively large time span (94-72 Ma) of \n\nthis magmatic episode, the composition of the mantle of the WIM can be considered as \n\nbeing reasonably stable and homogenous over that time period, which covered two \n\ndistinct pulses of  magmatic activity (Miranda et al., 2009; this study). These values are \n\nalso within the range of compositions previously obtained for the Monchique alkaline \n\ncomplex (fig. 7.40) by Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997). \n\nThe isotopic signatures shown by the samples of the alkaline cycle of the \n\nMesozoic magmatic activity in the WIM are notoriously different from the ones that \n\ncharacterize the mantle sources of the previous tholeiitic and transitional cycles, which \n\nare of Early Jurassic and Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous ages, respectively. \n\nThe tholeiitic cycle (? 198 Ma, Veratti et al., 2007) is part of the Central Atlantic \n\nMagmatic province, contemporaneous with rifting in the Algarve, Santiago do Cac\u00e9m \n\nand southernmost Lusitanian basins, where it has been described, and therefore related \n\nto the initial rifting of the Atlantic and Tethyan margins (e.g. Martins, 1991; Martins et \n\nal., 2008; Cebri\u00e1 et al., 2003). Basic magmas from the tholeiitic cycle shows higher \n\nvalues for 207Pb/204Pb and 87Sr/86Sr and lower ?Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb isotopic \n\n\n\n \n\n274 \n \n\nratios (Messejana dolerite dyke - 87Sr/86Sri 0.70524 to 0.70673, ?Ndi  -3.4 to 0.12; \n206Pb/204Pb 18.385-18.715, 207Pb/204Pb 15.616-15.641, 208Pb/204Pb 38.371-38.701 Cebri\u00e1 \n\net al., 2003;  tholeiitic volcanism from the Algarve  basin - 87Sr/86Sri > 0.70539; Martins  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.40: Plots of Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios for the samples from the Late Cretaceous Alkaline \n\nmagmatism of the WIM, including the Madeira-Tore Rise (Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006), \n\nMonchique complex and Ormonde seamount (Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997), and the data for the onshore \n\noccurrences by Grange et al.

The isotopic and geochemical signature of \n\nthe magmas from this cycle has been interpreted as to reflect partial melting of enriched \n\nmetasomatized mantle domains, with the heat required for their fusion being provided \n\nby the ascending asthenosphere which occurred as a consequence of progressive \n\nextension in the Lusitanian basin during the last rifting phases (Grange et al., 2008; \n\nAlves, 2010). \n\nFrom the tholeiitic (Lower Jurassic) to the transitional (Upper Jurassic/Lower \n\nCretaceous) and finally to the alkaline cycle (Late Cretaceous) there seems to be a trend \n\ntowards a more depleted Sr and Nd isotopic signature with time (figs. 7.40-41), which \n\ncontrasts with the progressive enrichment in the trace element abundances and \n\nincreasingly radiogenic Pb that is simultaneously observed (fig. 7.40-41). \n\nGrange et al. (2010) sampled and analyzed the Sintra, Sines and Monchique \n\ncomplexes as well as the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill from the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle. \n\nBased on whole rock trace element data and isotopic analysis from feldspar (Pb and Sr) \n\nand zircon (Hf) separates, these authors proposed a sublithospheric enriched DMM \n\nsource that produced melts that were subsequently contaminated with variable amounts \n\nof more radiogenic subcontinental lithospheric mantle. \n\nThese authors assumed that their isotopic and trace element data did not reflect \n\nany kind of contamination from crustal lithologies and therefore was representative of \n\nthe mantle sources of these magmas. This interpretation included even the more evolved \n\nsamples, which in this case include granites and microgranites (Sintra), syenites (Sines) \n\nand nepheline syenites (Monchique). It is difficult to explain the generation of large \n\nvolumes of felsic magma only by fractional crystallization of basic magmas in upper \n\ncrustal settings without the occurrence of any kind of contamination, as they proposed \n\nfor the alkaline complexes of Sintra, Sines and Monchique. In these complexes, the \n\nmore evolved rocks make up most of the outcropping area, while the basic rocks are \n\n\n\n \n\n276 \n \n\nmuch rarer at the surface (e.g. Matos Alves, 1964; Canilho, 1972; Clavijo and \n\nValadares, 2003) and do not seem to be compensated by extensive volumes of mafic \n\ncumulates at depth (e.g. Kullberg et al., 2010 for Sintra). Furthermore, the isotopic data \n\nfor these more evolved rocks from (Grange et al., 2010) plots along the contaminated \n\ntrend defined for the more evolved rocks identified in this study (see section 7.3.2 and \n\nfigs. 7.39 and 7.19-24), towards compositions that are more enriched in 87Sr/86Sri and \n207Pb/204Pb but that show lower 206Pb/204Pb and  208Pb/204Pb. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.41: Plots of Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios for the samples from the three cycles of Mesozoic \n\nmagmatic activity present in the WIM. Data for the alkaline cycle corresponds to the uncontaminated \n\nsamples from this study, for the transitional cycle data are from Alves (2010) and Grange et al. (2008) \n\nand for the tholeiitic cycle from C\u00e9bria et al. (2003). \n \n\nThe increases in K/Nb, Th/La and coupled decrease in Nb/U with increasing \n\nsilica contents seen in the more evolved and contaminated rocks in this study (see \n\n\n\n \n\n277 \n \n\nsection 7.3.2, fig. 7.21), also take place in the acid rocks sampled by Grange et al. \n\n(2010), thus pointing again towards important contamination by silica rich lithologies \n\nassociated with the generation of these rocks (fig. 7.42). The marked positive Pb and \n\nnegative Nb anomalies seen in the multielemental plots for the more evolved rocks (see \n\nfig. 4 in Grange et al., 2010) reinforce the conclusion that, in opposition to what is \n\nproposed by these authors, such rocks formed from magmas that have assimilated \n\nsignificant amounts of crustal contaminant(s) and therefore their isotopic signatures \n\ncannot be used to make inferences about the nature of their mantle source. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.42: Plots of SiO2 vs. incompatible elements ratios Th/La, K/Nb, Zr/Nb and Nb/U for the studied \n\nsamples and for the samples from Sintra, Sines, Monchique and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas collected by Grange et al \n\n(2010). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n278 \n \n\nSince the samples from the Sines and Sintra \u201cgabbro\u201d analyzed by Grange et al. \n\n(2010) actually correspond to diorites which are already slightly contaminated (see \n\nsection 7.3.2), only the samples from the Monchique gabbro can be considered as \n\nrepresentatives of uncontaminated, but more or less fractionated mantle melts. \n\nMeanwhile the other \u201cgabbros\u201d, the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill and the evolved rocks from the \n\nalkaline complexes all show evidence for important crustal contamination. The values \n\nreported by Grange et al. (2010) for the uncontaminated Monchique gabbro are \n87Sr/86Sri = 0.70356, 206Pb/204Pb = 19.237, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.555 and 208Pb/204Pb = \n\n38.918, which is within the range reported for the uncontaminated samples from the \n\nWIM reported in this work and by Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997), except for slightly \n\nlower 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb (fig. 7.40). These authors attribute the isotopic \n\nsignatures described for Monchique to an enriched DMM component derived from a \n\ndeep, sublithospheric OIB like source that might correspond to a mantle plume or to the \n\nambient astenospheric mantle enriched by a mantle plume. \n\nThe apparent decoupling of the Sr, Pb and Hf isotopic ratios detected by Grange \n\net al. (2010) in the samples from Sintra is puzzling, but can be tentatively explained by \n\nthe mixed effects of the contaminated nature of the magmas with the late stage \n\nhydrothermal event that affect this complex (see sections 6.1 and 7.3.2). Crustal \n\ncontamination would lead to an increase in 87Sr/86Sr, 207Pb/204Pb coupled with a \n\ndecrease in 206Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb and ?Hf. However, some samples seem to show low \n87Sr/86Sr, high 207Pb/204Pb and variable, but still positive ?Hf.  On section 7.2.2 the \n\nhigher 206Pb/204Pb, and lower 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb shown in the whole rock \n\nanalysis of the Sintra gabbros were attributed to the effects of late stage hydrothermal \n\nalteration by a Pb rich fluid. This hydrothermal alteration affects the feldspars and \n\nplagioclases more clearly (see section 6.1) than the other phases and so could be \n\nresponsible for the more radiogenic Pb signature seen in some of the feldspar separates \n\nanalyzed by Grange et al. (2010). However, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios are low and the \n\nmetasomatizing fluids are not thought to contain unradiogenic Sr (see section 7.3.2).  \n\nThe low 87Sr/86Sri in the feldspar separates from the more evolved rocks \n\nanalyzed by Grange et al. (2010) might correspond to an artifact generated by \n\novercorrection for the Rb-Sr decay in samples with high Rb/Sr ratios (1.56-5.77 for the \n\nmore evolved rocks while only 0.002 to 0.2 in the basic to intermediate rocks). Any \n\nsmall imprecisions in the analysis of trace element concentrations in high Rb/Sr rocks or \n\nminerals leads to large error propagation in the calculation of age corrected Sr isotope \n\n\n\n \n\n279 \n \n\ndata and therefore produces less reliable 87Sr/86Sri values. On fig 7.43 the calculated \n87Sr/86Sri are plotted along with the repective error bars, and it is possible to observe that \n\nthe two granite samples from Sintra, (PT9A, alkali granite and PT5A, microgranite, \n\nGrange et al., 2010), display the largest error bars for the calculated 87Sr/86Sri and could \n\ntherefore have reasonably higher isotopic ratios than the ones they are attributed in \n\nGrange et al. (2010). Such hypothetical higher 87Sr/86Sri would be more compatible with \n\ntheir contaminated nature. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.43: Plot of age corrected Sr isotope ratios vs. Rb/Sr for feldspar separates analyzed by Grange et al. \n(2010), with error bars representing the propagated error using a \u00b1 5 % analytical uncertainty in Rb and Sr \ndeterminations. The data shows that the uncertainties in 87Sr/86Sri increase with higher the Rb/Sr ratios. \n\n \n\nA north to south increase in 206Pb/204Pb with simultaneous decrease in 87Sr/86Sri \n\nand 207Pb/204Pb in the occurrences studied by Grange et al. (2010) was interpreted by \n\nthese authors as reflecting the progressive north to south increase in the contribution of \n\nan asthenospheric component. However, this trend is not observed on the data for \n\nuncontaminated rocks, for both the onshore and offshore occurrences (fig. 7.44). \n\nInstead, the samples show considerable scatter of isotopic ratios at whatever latitude \n\nthey occur, arguing against a larger lithospheric contribution in the northern occurrences \n\nor significant variation of contribution from different components with latitude. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n280 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.44: Plots of Sr and Pb isotopic ratios vs. Latitude for the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism of \n\nthe WIM, including the Ormonde seamount (Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997) and the Madeira-Tore rise \n\n(Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006). \n \n\nAlso, the use of the Cabo Ortegal Complex by Grange et al (2010) as a proxy for \n\nthe subcontinental lithospheric mantle composition of the WIM can be questioned since \n\nit corresponds to a metamorphosed Lower Paleozoic ophiolite with back-arc affinities, \n\nand that shows signs of modification by subduction processes (Santos Zalduegui et al., \n\n1996; Martinez et al., 2007). Such does not seem an adequate proxy to compare with the \n\ncompositional characteristics with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle from a \n\n\n\n \n\n281 \n \n\nMesozoic passive margin such as the WIM. Instead, data from exposed sublithospheric \n\nmantle rocks along peridotite ridges in the Galicia banks and Iberia abyssal plain a seem \n\nto be more adequate proxy, but these show a more depleted trace element and Nd \n\nisotope signature and enriched Sr compositions (e.g. Beard et al., 2002; Chazot et al., \n\n2005, fig.7.40). However, the Pb isotopic signature of these rocks remains \n\nundetermined except for some late pegmatitic veins of Cretaceous age that intrude those \n\nperidotites, which show rather unradiogenic lead (206Pb/204Pb 18.65, 207Pb/204Pb 15.48 \n\nand 208Pb/204Pb 38.3, Beard et al., 2002) and cannot be the source of the old lithospheric \n\ncomponent identified in the WIM by Grange et al. (2010) and Merle et al. (2006). \n\nOther authors have argued that basic alkaline intraplate magmas enriched in \n\ntrace elements and with radiogenic Pb and Nd relatively unradiogenic Sr can result from \n\nthe melting of old recycled metasomatized lithospheric mantle (e.g. Pilet et al., 2005), \n\nof subcontinental lithospheric mantle metasomatized during previous subduction events \n\n(Finn et al., 2005; Panter et al., 2006), or even of veins that resulted from metasomatism \n\ncontemporaneous of rifting and asthenospheric ascension that created high U/Pb \n\ndomains (Nardini et al., 2009) \n\nAn origin within the subcontinental lithosphere for the Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\nmagmas of the WIM can be rejected since the known isotopic composition for the \n\nperidotites and metasomatic veins of the continental lithosphere sampled in the Iberian \n\nAbyssal plain are markedly different from the studied magmas (fig. 7.40, Sch\u00e4rer et al., \n\n1995; Seifert et al., 1997; Charpentier et al., 1998; Beard et al., 2002; Chazot et al., \n\n2005). The metasomatic events recorded in these peridotites seem to be caused by the \n\npercolations of depleted asthenospheric melts (Charpentier et al., 1998; Beard et al., \n\n2002; Chazot et al., 2005) mostly during the Cretaceous (138-122 Ma, F\u00e9raud et al., \n\n1996; Sch\u00e4rer et al., 1995; Sch\u00e4rer et al., 2000; Beard et al., 2002), i. e. they are \n\ncontemporaneous of the last extensional phases on the WIM and appear to be marking \n\nthe transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading. The products from this \n\nmetasomatic event did not have enough time to evolve the radiogenic Pb signatures \n\nobserved in the studied samples, as can be confirmed by the unradiogenic Pb isotope \n\nratios of the gabbroic pegmatitic intrusions in site 1070 of ODP leg 173 (Beard et al., \n\n2002). \n\nAn earlier phase of magmatism that might have affected the lithospheric mantle \n\nof the WIM is recorded in the exposed lithospheric section exposed in the ridges, but it \n\nis thought to correspond to underplating under the lower crust during a late Variscan \n\n\n\n \n\n282 \n \n\nextensional phase at ? 270 Ma (Whitmarsh and Wallace, 2001). However, both these \n\nmetasomatic phases do not show the trace element and isotopic enriched characteristics \n\nthat characterize the source of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas. \n\nFrom the discussion above, a significant contribution of an ancient lithospheric \n\ncomponent in the source of the alkaline rocks from the WIM can be discarded, although \n\nit is possible that there is an input from the subcontinental lithosphere that has been \n\nrecently metasomatized by enriched sublithospheric melts, as seems to be indicated by \n\nthe presence of residual amphibole and of a carbonatite metasomatic signature (see \n\nsection 7.4.1). \n\n \n\n7.5.2 Pb isotopic signatures in seamounts and the effects of seawater alteration and \n\ncrustal contamination \n\n \n\nMerle et al. (2006) proposed an asthenospheric source with an OIB like \n\ncomposition to justify the composition of the seamounts of the northern part of the \n\nMTR (Madeira-Tore Rise) and also identified a lithospheric source component enriched \n\nin 207Pb/204Pb. In this study, as in Grange et al. (2010), Pb isotopic data was acquired on \n\nplagioclase and feldspar separates, which in the case of Merle et al. (2006), are assumed \n\nnot to contain any initial U and to therefore reflect the initial Pb isotopic composition of \n\nthe melt. This assumption might not be accurate in the case of the onshore samples due \n\nto the hydrothermal alteration event discussed above, and also in the case of the samples \n\nfrom the MTR due to the important seawater alteration.  \n\nSeawater alteration might remove common magmatic lead (Michard and \n\nAlbar\u00e9de, 1985; Hauff et al., 2000) while simultaneously introducing some Pb from \n\nseawater (You et al., 1996) in the feldspars and plagioclases. If this alteration process \n\noccurs at relatively high temperatures (i.e. shortly after extrusion), it can be responsible \n\nfor the partial albitization of the feldspars. The albitic structures can take up more \n\nsecondary U and Pb (Housh and Bowring, 1991; You et al., 1996) and therefore \n\ncontribute to a higher time integrated Pb isotopic signature, especially if no age \n\ncorrection is applied. Otherwise, radiogenic Pb can accumulate in cracks and grain \n\nboundaries (Ludwig and Silver, 1977; Housh and Bowring, 1991) or be present in \n\noxide, sulphide or other high U/Pb mineral inclusions in the feldspars (Ludwig and \n\nSilver, 1977; Housh and Bowring, 1991; Bryce and DePaolo, 2004). Although the \n\n\n\n \n\n283 \n \n\nexcess Pb in crystal cracks and boundaries might be easily removed during leaching, if \n\nthere is an important albitic component or inclusions of high U/Pb minerals in these \n\nplagioclase and feldspars, there might be an important excess Pb component that Merle \n\net al. (2006) did not consider. \n\nThe suggestion that at least part of the anomalous Pb ratios in MTR samples are \n\nthe result of alteration processes is reinforced by the observation that for the same \n\nseamount (Teresa, in Geldmacher et al., 2006 and Gago Coutinho, in Merle et al., 2006) \n207Pb/204Pb values are substantially different, being lower in the leached whole rock data \n\nset (207Pb/204Pb 15.589-15.594, Geldmacher et al., 2006) and showing higher values in \n\nthe dataset based on feldspar and plagioclase separates (207Pb/204Pb 15.661, Merle et al., \n\n2006). \n\nNevertheless, it must be mentioned that the simple addition of radiogenic Pb \n\nfrom seawater will not produce the observed anomalous radiogenic Pb isotopic \n\nsignatures in the feldspars from the MTR, since North Atlantic seawater isotopic \n\nsignature tends to show lower 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb for the higher 207Pb/204Pb \n\nvalues (fig. 7.39, von Blackenburg et al., 1996; O\u2019Nions et al., 1998; Abouchami et al., \n\n1999), while these rocks can show simultaneously high 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and \n208Pb/204Pb.  \n\nIn the oxidizing environments that characterize seawater alteration, U is present \n\nas uranyl (UO2+) cations which form compounds that are highly soluble in seawater and \n\ncan be introduced in igneous rocks via secondary phases during low temperature \n\nalteration (MacDougall et al., 1979, Michard and Albar\u00e9de, 1985; Chen et al., 1986; \n\nHauf et al., 2000; Wheat et al., 2002). This can lead to increases up to 500% in the U/Pb \n\nratios of crystalline basaltic material (Verma, 1991) and consequentially to higher \n206Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb with time due to radiogenic ingrowth. Such an effect has \n\nbeen observed in other altered, Mesozoic submarine igneous rocks, including altered \n\ngabbros in the Iberian Abyssal plain (Seifert et al., 1997), basalts recovered in Hawaiian \n\nODPs (Nobre Silva et al., 2009), the oceanic crust near the Canaries islands (Hoernle, \n\n1998), and the oceanic lithosphere of the Caribbean Igneous Province (e.g. Hauff et al., \n\n2000).  \n\nPb is more susceptible than other elements to show increases in isotopic ratios \n\nafter hydrothermal alteration due to changes in the U and Pb concentrations introduced \n\nduring such events. Given the relatively shorter half lives of U isotopes when compared \n\nto other isotopic systems (e.g. 235U ? t1/2 = 0.71 x 109 yr, 238U ? t 1/2 = 4.47 x 109 yr, \n\n\n\n \n\n284 \n \n\n232Th ? t 1/2 = 14 x 109 yr, 147Sm ? t 1/2 = 1.06 x 1010 yr, 87Rb ? t 1/2 = 48.8 x 109 yr, \n\nFaure, 1986), for relatively high U/Pb, isotopic Pb ratios can become more radiogenic in \n\nrelatively short time spans, as it has been recognized by Hauff et al. (2000) that \n\nassociated high 207Pb/204Pb and scattered Th/U to the effects of hydrothermal alteration. \n\nSo the higher 207Pb/204Pb and sometimes 208Pb/204Pb in some altered samples can be \n\ncaused by a complex, open system alteration mechanism involving Pb removal, and U \n\nand radiogenic Pb remobilization from/by seawater. Meanwhile, Th has very low \n\nconcentrations in seawater (? 0.00064 ppb, Langmuir and Herman, 1980) and is not \n\neasily removed during seawater alteration (Chen et al., 1986), so it is basically \n\nimmobile and its concentration tends to increase in relation to Pb during alteration, due \n\nto Pb removal. This will result in different increases in the Pb isotopic ratios due to the \n\neffects of radiogenic ingrowth of rocks that have seen their U/Pb, Th/Pb and U/Th ratios \n\nmodified by seawater alteration processes. \n\nHowever, the extremely high 207Pb/204Pb in some of the samples from the MTR \n\ncannot be easily reconciled with simple time integrated decay of a \u201csource\u201d with a high \n\nU/Pb ratio resulting from seawater alteration. Since 235U has such a short half life, it is \n\npresent in very small amounts in the present day, and also was present in small amounts \n\nat the time of formation of these rocks. As a result high 207Pb/204Pb values usually \n\nindicate the presence of a very old, generally Proterozoic/Archean component with high \n\ntime integrated U/Pb. Since the lithosphere in the region does not seem to incorporate \n\nancient metasomatic veins with such age or composition (Beard et al., 2002; Chazot et \n\nal., 2005), this component could be inherited from contamination of the evolved MTR \n\nmagmas by terrigenous upper crustal sediment. \n\nUpper crustal rocks show high U/Pb ratios due to growth in volcanic arcs, where \n\nhigh U/Pb magmas were generated during the Archaean (e.g. Mata et al., 2007) and U \n\naddition during granulite facies metamorphism of the lower crust which removes U and \n\nadds it to its upper part (e.g. Rudnick and Goldstein, 1990). These rocks can be eroded \n\nand the resulting sediments that inherit their radiogenic Pb isotopic signatures (average \n\nof 18.93, 15.71 and 39.03 for 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb ratios, \n\nrespectively, Millot et al., 2004) that will eventually end up being deposited as \n\nturbidites at high depths in the oceans, retaining the same upper crustal isotopic \n\nsignatures (average  206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb of 19.22, 15.78, and 39.58, \n\nrespectively, Hemming and McLennan, 2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n285 \n \n\nSince the magmas with \u201clithospheric\u201d isotopic signatures in the MTR are of \n\nintermediate to acidic nature (Merle et al., 2006), it is reasonable to assume that they \n\nexperienced some low pressure fractionation in relatively shallow magma chambers. \n\nThose magma chambers can be located in the interface between the ocean floor and a \n\nlayer of terrigenous turbidites on top of which the seamounts built. Such a site \n\ncorresponds to an important density and rigidity contrast between distinct layers, which \n\ncan facilitate the stagnation of magma and the formation of planar intrusive bodies \n\nwhere magma can accumulate and evolve (e.g Kavanagh et al., 2005). Intrusions in \n\nCretaceous sediments near the Tore seamount can be observed in the seismic reflection \n\nprofiles done in the area (C. Roque, pers. comm. 2010) and turbiditic sediments were \n\nidentified in hole 1070A of ODP Leg 173 (Whitmarsh et al., 1998), at approximately \n\nthe same longitude as the Tore seamount, so it is possible that such a detritic layer is \n\npresent along the remainder of the MTR and had an important role on controlling the \n\nlocation of the magma chambers that fed those seamounts.  \n\nIf so, magmatic evolution by crystal fractionation at the MTR is likely to have \n\nbeen accompanied by some degree of assimilation of these sedimentary lithologies \n\nresulting from AFC processes, which might have been responsible for the observed \n\nincrease in 207Pb/204Pb. This is supported by the detection of old radiogenic Pb in the \n\nzircons present in these rocks (Merle et al., 2006). The relatively unchanged Sr and Hf \n\nisotopic ratios can be justified by the higher contents of these elements in the magmatic \n\nrocks relative to the sediments, which make contamination only evident after the \n\nassimilation or high amounts of contaminant. Cases of assimilation of continental \n\nsediment in oceanic environments have been previous documented in the Canaries \n\n(Thirlwall et al., 1997; Hoernle et al., 1998; Hansteen and Troll, 2003) \n\n The modification of U/Pb and Th/Pb ratios by hydrothermal alteration can also \n\nbe the cause of incorrect age corrections when calculating the initial Pb isotopic ratios in \n\nthese rocks. This leads to over or undercorrections which will not reflect the initial \n\nisotopic signatures of these rocks and of the source they originated from. This might be \n\nbehind the atypical Pb isotopic signatures of the Fontanelas seamount, which will be \n\ndiscussed below. \n\nAs it can be observed in fig. 7.45, U seems to have been mobile in the \n\nFontanelas seamount as well as in the Loul\u00e9 lamprophyres. The mobility of Pb is harder \n\nto assess since this element was only analyzed in the aliquots of the samples, some of \n\nwhich were leached. U-Th-Pb can be fractionated during leaching, resulting on an \n\n\n\n \n\n286 \n \n\nartificial increase of certain parent daughter ratios, which will in their their turn lead to \n\noverestimating the amount of radioactive decay that has taken place since magma \n\nextraction and cooling (e.g. Hauff et al., 2000). However, given that the age corrected \n\nsamples from Monchique from this work plot mostly within the compositional range \n\ndefined by the age corrected samples from Bernard-Griffiths et al (1997), we can infer \n\nthat the age correction has not been greatly overestimated for the samples collected \n\nonshore. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.45: Plot of Th vs. U for the analyzed samples. Samples that plot out of the trends defined by \n\nconstant Th/U have been affected by either U loss or addition. \n \n\nThe more enriched isotopic signature of the Fontanelas seamount can nearly be \n\nreproduced by the radioactive decay of a basaltic rock with an age corrected isotopic \n\nsignature similar to one of the basalts from the LVC (RM 43) but with much higher \n\nU/Pb, Th/Pb and Th/U, and consequentially higher 238U/204Pb and 232Th/204Pb, which \n\nwill lead to significantly more enriched 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb by radioactive decay \n\nin time. These elementar ratios might have been modified during alteration and leaching \n\nand therefore invalidate the application of the accurate age correction in these samples. \n\nNevertheless, the 207Pb/204Pb values obtained for the Fontanelas seamount in both in the \n\n\n\n \n\n287 \n \n\nmeasured and corrected ratios cannot be justified exclusively by alteration or improper \n\nage corrections so it should reflect a primary feature of the source of these rocks. \n\n \n\n7.5.3 Nature of the sublithospheric mantle source \n\n \n\nFrom the discussion above we can conclude that the isotopic composition of the \n\nuncontaminated Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM shows characteristics \n\nthat are compatible with a sublithospheric source. \n\nThese rocks have higher Sr and Pb isotope ratios but less radiogenic Nd than the \n\nDMM (average DMM: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70263, 143Nd/144Nd 0.51313, 206Pb/204Pb 18.275, \n207Pb/204Pb 15.486, Workman and Hart, 2005), which is thought to represent most of the \n\ndepleted asthenospheric upper mantle. They also have lower 87Sr/86Sr and higher \n143Nd/144Nd than the EM 1 and 2 components (e.g. Hart et al., 1992) and lead isotopic \n\ncompositions are considerably less radiogenic and lower than the ones that characterize \n\nthe HIMU component (Hart et al., 1992; Hauri et al., 1994; Stracke et al., 2005). \n\nThe source thus seems to show an intermediate composition between DMM and \n\nHIMU, having lower time integrated Sm/Nd but higher Rb/Sr, U/Pb and Th/U than \n\nDMM while still having lower time integrated U/Pb and Th/U than HIMU as well as \n\nslightly higher Rb/Sr than this last component.   \n\nSuch a composition is at least partially within the range defined for several other \n\nmantle components, such as the C component (Hanan and Graham, 1996), FOZO (Hart \n\net al., 1992; Hauri et al., 1994; Stracke et al., 2005), PREMA (Zindler and Hart, 1986; \n\nW\u00f6rner et al., 1986), LVC (Hoernle et al., 1995), CMR (Lustrino and Wilson, 2007), \n\nPHEM (Farley et al., 1992). These components have been detected in OIB and \n\nintraplate continental magmatic events all over the globe and are thought to represent \n\nmixing between EM, HIMU and DMM components within the mantle (PREMA, \n\nZindler and Hart, 1986), lower mantle material present as a mixing component in all \n\ndeep mantle plumes (PREMA, FOZO and PHEM, Zindler and Hart, 1986, Hart et al., \n\n1992, Farley et al., 1992), lower mantle containing recycled oceanic crust (C, Hanan \n\nand Graham, 1996 or FOZO, Stracke et al., 2005), enriched upwelling asthenosphere \n\n(LVC, Hoernle et al., 1995), or the local asthenospheric mantle that has been enriched \n\nby subduction or delamination processes during the Hercynian or Alpine orogenies \n\n(CMR, Lustrino and Wilson, 2007).  \n\n\n\n \n\n288 \n \n\nFOZO was at first defined from the observation of a FOcal ZOne (hence the \n\nacronym FOZO) where the compositional arrays of mantle plumes (represented by \n\nOIBs) and the depleted mantle (represented by MORBs) converge in Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic \n\nspace (Hart et al., 1992; Stracke et al., 2005). This component is likely to have acquired \n\nits isotopic signature from the recycling oceanic crust to the lower mantle (Stracke et al., \n\n2005) and is the mantle component that shows a better agreement with the observed \n\nisotopic signatures of the source of the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM. \n\nAlthough many authors consider FOZO an idependent mantle component (e.g. \n\nHart et al., 1992; Stracke et al., 2005), it is possible to produce an equivalent type of \n\nisotopic signature that characterizes it from the mixing and dilution of HIMU with the \n\nremaining DMM and EM components (e.g. Hoernle et al., 1991; Widom et al., 1999). A \n\nclear way of making a distinction between these two hypotheses is through the analysis \n\nof noble gas and Os isotope data since FOZO possess distinctively high 3He/4He ratios \n\n(R/RA ? 45, Ballentine et al., 2002) while HIMU shows much lower 3He/4He (R/RA ?  \n\n5, Ballentine et al., 2002). FOZO is also thought to possess unradiogenic Os signatures \n\n(187Os/188Os ? 0.128), while HIMU presents very radiogenic Os ( 187Os/188Os ? 0.150) \n\ndue to its recycled nature (e.g. Hauri, 2002; Class and Goldstein, 2005). \n\nAdditionally, Piromallo et al. (2008) suggested that the widespread and \n\nrelatively constant isotopic signature of Cretaceous to Quaternary magmas in the Euro-\n\nMediterranean area, which motivated the proposal of common sublithospheric mantle \n\nreservoirs (such as the previously mentioned LVC and CMR), is the result of a large \n\nscale mantle contamination episode by the Central Atlantic Plume (CAP) that took \n\nplace in the Late Cretaceous, when the CAP plume was channeled through thinned \n\nwestern European lithosphere. The CAP plume should presently correspond to the \n\nmantle upwelling that feeds the Canaries and Cape Verde mantle plumes (Piromallo et \n\nal., 2008).   \n\nTherefore, the geochemical data presented in this study, in accordance with what \n\nhad been previously suggested for this area by Pal\u00e1cios (1985), Martins (1991), \n\nBernard-Griffiths et al. (1997), Merle et al. (2006), Lustrino and Wilson (2007), \n\nPiromallo et al. (2008), and Grange et al. (2010), indicate that the source for the Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM seems to be primarily of sublithospheric origin  \n\nand to be sampling a mantle composition similar to that of the FOZO component or to a \n\nmix between HIMU, DMM and EM components. \n\n\n\n \n\n289 \n \n\nAs the sublithospheric mantle in question does not correspond to the DMM type \n\nmantle that is sampled in Mid Ocean Ridges but seems to show a FOZO like signature, \n\nit should therefore reflect a more enriched, plume like contribution. The contribution of \n\na plume like feature for this magmatism had been previously proposed for Monchique, \n\nby Geldmacher and Hoernle (2000) who interpreted it as the result of the first pulse of \n\nactivity of the Madeira plume. In the case of the Madeira-Tore rise, the Cretaceous to \n\npresent magmatic activity has been attributed to the action of a large scale thermal \n\nanomaly in the Canaries-Madeira-Portugal area (Hoernle et al., 1995; Merle et al., 2006, \n\n2009) or to complex interactions between the Canaries and Madeira hotspots, the \n\nCretaceous Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and movement along the Azores-Gibraltar fault \n\n(Geldmacher et al., 2006).Grange et al. (2010) suggested the involvement of the same \n\nmantle plume proposed by Merle et al. (2006, 2009) to justify the onshore magmatism \n\nof the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill as well as the Sintra, Sines and Monchique igneous complexes. \n\nAs was noticed in section 7.2 (figs. 7.12 and 7.15), most of the uncontaminated \n\nsamples presented in this study, as well as many of the samples from the Madeira-Tore \n\nRise fall within the compositional field defined by samples from locations thought to \n\nhave formed due to the activity of the Canaries mantle plume. \n\nThough one may question the validity of the comparison of initial isotopic ratios \n\nof the studied Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM (94 to 72 Ma) with the \n\ncompositional range of the Canaries and Madeira plumes which are partially defined \n\nbased on the composition of significantly younger rocks.   \n\nIn order to address this question diagrams where the age corrected composition \n\nof the WIM alkaline rocks is plotted along with present day samples from the Canaries \n\nand Madeira plumes (7.46a, 7.47a,c), similar to the ones previously used throughout this \n\nstudy, are compared with diagrams where an age correction for 80 Ma (the average age \n\nof the studied WIM rocks) was applied (fig. 7.46b and 7.47b,d) both to the studied \n\nsamples and to the rocks of the Madeira and Canaries plumes. Notice that such an age \n\ncorrection, when applied do Canaries and Madeira plumes, allows the estimation of the \n\nisotopic composition of the magmas produced by those hotspots at the time of \n\ngeneration of the WIM alkaline rocks. \n\nThese figures (fig. 7.46 and 7.47) clearly show the good agreement between the \n\ntwo types of diagrams with both supporting the isotopic similitude between the WIM \n\nalkaline magmas and those erupted from the Canaries.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n290 \n \n\n \nFig. 7.46: Plots of the measured (a) and recalculated for and 80 Ma age (b) Sr and Nd isotopic \n\ncompositions of the analyzed rocks and for samples from the Madeira and Canaries hotspots. \n \n\nHowever, the Sr-Nd isotope diagram presenting recalculated compositions for \n\n80 Ma of decay shows a significant number of samples that do not fit into the Canaries \n\nfield due to somewhat more radiogenic Sr (fig. 7.46). This can be a consequence of the \n\nsmaller amount of data points that include the necessary data to recalculate the isotopic \n\ncompositions. Alternatively, these higher Sr and perhaps lower ?Nd can reflect small \n\ncontributions from a lithospheric component that might correspond to the \n\nclinopyroxenites and websterites identified by Chazot et al. (2005) in the Iberian \n\nAbyssal Plain and represented in fig. 7.40. However this lithospheric contribution does \n\nnot seem to affect the Pb isotopic system or the trace element contents. \n\nMost of the samples from the MTR also plot on the same field, reinforcing the \n\nsuggestion made by Geldmacher et al. (2006) that this feature might be related to the \n\nevolution of the Canaries hotspot. \n\nIt should also be noted that the samples from the Ormonde seamount and one of \n\nthe samples from the MTR (Tore NW, Merle et al., 2006) and even the Fontanelas \n\nseamount seem to show compositions closer to the field defined by the samples  from \n\nthe Madeira hotspot (figs. 7.46 and 7.47). Given that these occurrences seem to be \n\nyounger than the others near them (except for Fontanelas, whose age is still not known), \n\nit is possible that the Madeira hotspot also played a role in generating them, since this \n\n\n\n \n\n291 \n \n\nhotspot occurs further north than the Canaries hotspot and the general direction of plate \n\nmotion during the Late Cretaceous is towards the NE (e.g. Piromallo et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 7.47: Plots of the measured (a, c) and recalculated for and 80 Ma age (b, d) Pb isotopic compositions \n\nof the analyzed rocks and for samples from the Madeira and Canaries hotspots. \n \n\nIt therefore seems likely that the source that generated the Late Cretaceous \n\nAlkaline magmatism on the onshore and offshore WIM was related to the presence of a \n\nsublithospheric thermal anomaly that appears to correspond to the Canaries mantle \n\n\n\n \n\n292 \n \n\nplume, which shows an overall composition close to the FOZO mantle component (e.g. \n\nStracke et al., 2005).  \n\nGiven that the Canaries mantle plume has been subject to numerous studies, the \n\navailable data allow for the discrimination between FOZO and a mix of HIMU, DMM \n\nand the other mantle components in the source of the magmas of this mantle plume. \n\nHIMU has, however, consistently been the dominant plume component suggested in the \n\nliterature (e.g. Hoernle et al., 1991; Thirlwall et al., 1997; Widom et al., 1999; Gurenko \n\net al., 2006; Gurenko et al., 2009).  \n\nHelium isotope ratios (3He/4He from 6.3 to 9.6 RA; Hilton et al., 2000; Gurenko \n\net al., 2006) are low, but can be interpreted as resulting from the contribution of an \n\nundegassed component, more consistent with the presence of diluted FOZO (Hilton et \n\nal., 2000). Alternatively, it could be the result of HIMU being diluted in a DMM \n\ncomponent (Hilton et al., 2000). Hilton et al. (2000) favour the hypothesis where an \n\nundegassed component with high 3He/4He and radiogenic Pb (FOZO?) mixes with \n\nDMM which is degassed and has unradiogenic Pb, although this is still a controversial \n\nissue (e.g. Graham, 2002; Gurenko et al., 2006). FOZO has also been suggested to be \n\nthe dominant mantle component in the Canaries mantle plume by Ignacio et al. (2006) \n\nbased on the isotopic signature of carbonatites from Fuerteventura. \n\nHowever, Os isotope systematics for the uncontaminated samples of the \n\nCanaries mantle plume (187Os/188Os 0.139 \u2013 0.151, Widom et al., 1999) support an \n\nimportant contribution of a radiogenic, recycled component variably mixed with \n\nshallow, depleted asthenospheric mantle, compatible with HIMU and not with FOZO \n\n(Widom et al., 1999). \n\nTherefore, the dominant plume component in the Canaries mantle plume, and \n\ntherefore in the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM, appears to be HIMU, which \n\nis thought to reflect the recycling of old Proterozoic (1.2 to 2.0 Ga) oceanic crust (e.g. \n\nWidom et al., 1999). \n\nNevertheless, the lack of a clear age progression for the alkaline magmatism of \n\nthe WIM implies that the magmas had their ascension and location strongly conditioned \n\nby local stress fields, structure, and plate motions in the region during the Late \n\nCretaceous. \n\nThe isotopic composition of the source remained relatively homogenous during \n\nthe both pulses of alkaline magmatism, from 94 to 72 Ma. Nevertheless, differences in \n\ntrace element composition between these two pulses point towards the presence of \n\n\n\n \n\n293 \n \n\nresidual amphibole in the source of some of the more primitive alkaline rocks from the \n\nsecond pulse of alkaline (75-72 Ma) activity in the WIM. This, along with other trace \n\nelement characteristics of the same samples, agrees with the occurrence of \n\nmetasomatism by a volatile rich (H2O + CO2) metasomatic agent in the source shortly \n\nbefore eruption. The metasomatic signature decreases with increasing degree of melting, \n\nmeaning that there was not an exclusively metasomatic contribution for these magmas. \n\nThe source for such a metasomatic agent might have been low degree melts from a \n\ncarbonated peridotite in an ascending mantle plume or asthenospheric convection cell, \n\nas proposed in section 7.4.  \n\nAmphibole is not stable at temperature and pressure conditions that characterize \n\nthe asthenosphere (e.g. Class and Goldstein, 1997) and is usually indicative of either \n\nmelting of the lithospheric mantle or at least of equilibration of asthenospheric melts in \n\nthe overlying metasomatized and amphibole bearing lithospheric mantle. \n\nThis metasomatism is particularly evident in the source of the ultramafic \n\nlamprophyres and must have occurred a comparatively short time before the melting \n\nevent that generated them. This is because the isotopic compositions of the \n\nlamprophyres lie within the range for the other uncontaminated samples in the region \n\n(e.g. figs. 7.46 and 7.47), and thus show no evidence of the time-integrated \n\nincompatible element enrichment, resulting in more radiogenic Sr, Pb and depleted Nd \n\nsignatures, that would be expected if the metasomatism was a much older event. \n\nIt is likely that the hydrous and carbonated metasomatic melts derived from the \n\nlow degrees of melting from such plume quickly crystallized or were consumed during \n\nopen system metasomatic processes at the base of the lithosphere during the first pulse \n\nof activity. Only the liquids resulting from higher volumes of melting from the same \n\nsource, represented by the tephrites of the Foz da Fonte sill, reached the surface.  \n\nThe thermal boundary layer (TBL) at the base of the lithosphere, was then \n\nmetasomatized during the first pulse of alkaline magmatic activity. The metasomatized \n\nparts of this layer would have lower fusion temperatures due to their volatile rich nature \n\nand might have melted during the second pulse of activity, probably with the heat \n\naddition from other plume magmas. The melts from these metasomatic veins a \n\ncontributed with their specific trace element signature to the resulting magmas. As the \n\nasthenospheric contribution increased and the metasomatized domains at the TBL were \n\nconsumed during melting, the input metasomatic carbonatitic and the amphibole \n\n\n\n \n\n294 \n \n\nsignatures became more diluted and was progressively eliminated from the resulting \n\nmagmas. \n\nThis mechanism accounts for both the constant isotopic signature and the \n\ndifferences in trace element composition observed in these pulses, whereas a different \n\norigin for both pulses would probably have to imply differences in the isotopic \n\ncompositions of the lithospheric and asthenospheric components (e.g. Class and \n\nGoldstein, 1997; Class et al., 1998; Jung et al. 2006). \n\nThe heat source that melted the metasomatized lithosphere during the second \n\npulse of alkaline activity could correspond to the Canaries plume, whose hotter center, \n\nwas initially relatively far from the metasomatized domain, and might later have \n\napproached the zone of hydrated and enriched mantle lithosphere due to the motion of \n\nthe Iberian plate above it.  \n\nAnother hypothesis to justify the two different pulses is the involvement of the \n\nMadeira mantle plume during the second the second pulse of alkaline activity. As was \n\ndiscussed above, the presence of a younger (? 80 Ma, Merle et al., 2006) seamount in \n\nthe Tore area with an isotopic signature close to the lavas from the Madeira hotspot (e.g. \n\nfig.7.44-45) raises the possibility for the presence of this plume near the WIM during \n\nthe final stages of magmatic activity during the Late Cretaceous. The proximity of a \n\nsecond melting anomaly could have triggered the melting of the lithosphere that had \n\nbeen previously metasomatized by the action of melts from the earlier passage of the \n\nCanaries plume. However, the contribution of the Madeira mantle plume would be \n\nexpected to be reflected on the isotopic composition of the melts derived from higher \n\ndegrees of partial melting, which is not clear for the majority of samples from the \n\nsecond pulse (e.g. figs 7.46 and 7.47). \n\n  Alternatively, the identical isotopic signature in melts derived from a plume \n\nand with a metasomatic contribution could simply reflect the small degree melting and \n\nre-solidification at the leading edge of the starting head of a mantle plume, as was \n\nsuggested by Kerr et al. (2010) for the signature of the sills that these authors identified \n\nas being the first representatives of the melting of the R\u00e9union plume, in Pakistan.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n295 \n \n\n7.6 Summary \n\nThe geochemical and isotopic study of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism \n\nof the WIM allowed for the detailed characterization of these magmas, their evolution \n\nprocesses and mantle sources. \n\nThe ultrabasic to basic alkaline, trace element enriched melts seem to have \n\noriginated from low degrees of partial melting (1-6%) of a trace element enriched \n\nsource, located at depths equivalent to the garnet stability field (> 60 km). That source is \n\nlikely to correspond to a sublithospheric, volatile rich (CO2+H2O) garnet lherzolite. The \n\nmelts from the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline activity also show some \n\ncontribution from an amphibole bearing equivalent in the lithosphere. That same \n\nlithospheric lherzolite has been metasomatized by the first volatile rich (CO2+H2O) \n\nliquids derived from low degrees of melting from an ascending carbonated garnet \n\nlherzolite and therefore preserves most of its trace element and isotopic features. While \n\nsuch a metasomatic signature is only evident on the magmas from the second pulse of \n\nLate Cretaceous alkaline activity on the WIM, rocks from both pulses show similar \n\nisotopic signatures, meaning that the metasomatizing agent might have had the same \n\nsource as the magmas from the first pulse. \n\nThat ascending carbonated lherzolite was probably a part of the Canaries mantle \n\nplume since the uncontaminated magmas from the WIM show isotopic compositions \n\n(87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7 \u2013 3.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi \n15.609-15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00) similar to the rocks from the Canaries (see \n\nfigs. 7.12, 7.15, 7.17 and 7.46-47), which is thought to represent the surface expression \n\nof a deep mantle reservoir related with the recycling of oceanic lithospheric material. \n\nThe relatively low Mg#, Ni and Cr contents of the Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\nmagmas resulting from the partial melting of such sources went through early fractional \n\ncrystallization events before ascending to the surface or upper crustal levels. \n\nTrace element compositions indicate that at shallower depths, the ultrabasic to \n\nbasic magmas evolved towards more silicic compositions by fractional crystallization of \n\nfirstly olivine, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides, with amphibole and plagioclase gaining \n\nmore importance in the more differentiated terms. \n\nMost of the samples from the basic rocks in the igneous complexes of Sines and \n\nSintra have their major and trace element compositions controlled by crystal \n\naccumulation processes. The recognition of the existence of such processes allowed the \n\n\n\n \n\n296 \n \n\nidentification of different levels of exposure on what probably corresponded to the same \n\nmagmatic chamber in the different igneous complexes. In this case, the Pedras Negras \n\ngabbro in Sines and the Azoia gabbro in Sintra would correspond to deeper levels of the \n\nchambers, where more basic phases such as olivine and clinopyroxene precipitated, \n\nwhile the Praia Vasco da Gama and Peninha gabbros represent higher parts of the same \n\nintrusions, repectively, where more evolved liquid accumulated and precipitated mostly \n\namphibole and plagioclase. A similar process had already been identified in the Pa\u00e7o \n\nd\u2019Ilhas sill (Mahmoudi, 1991). \n\nHowever, fractional crystallization had to be coupled with assimilation of crustal \n\nlithologies in order to explain the evolution of the isotopic and trace element signatures \n\nseen in these rocks. Two different AFC trends are observed, one that is observed mainly \n\nin basic sills and implies the assimilation of an Sr-rich yet, Nd and Pb poor, contaminant \n\nwhich is only reflected in changes towards more radiogenic Sr isotopic signatures \n\n(87Sr/86Sri up to 0.7049 while ?Ndi remains unchanged), and is likely to correspond to a \n\ncarbonated lithology. The other AFC trend encompasses the majority of the more silica \n\nrich rocks and the contaminant involved should correspond to a lithology that is \n\nenriched in SiO2, Th, K, 87Sr/86Sr (up to 0.70389) and 207Pb/204Pb (up to 15.6336 \n207Pb/204Pbi), but depleted in La, Nb, 143Nd/144Nd (?Ndi down to 2.8), 206Pb/204Pb and \n208Pb/204Pb (down to 18.8268 and 38.6027). These characteristics are typical of upper \n\ncrustal rocks, but the exact nature of that upper crustal lithology remains unclear, \n\nalthough a siliciclastic sedimentary rock seems the more likely candidate. \n\nLead isotopic ratios in the gabbros from Sintra and Sines show values that are \n\ntypical of contaminated rocks but these samples do not, however, share any of the other \n\nisotopic or trace element characteristics with the other contaminated rocks. This \n\nsuggests that the unradiogenic 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb and radiogenic 207Pb/204Pb \n\nmight have been acquired by these gabbros as the result of an hydrothermal \n\nmetasomatic event that was also responsible for the crystallization of epidote, green \n\namphibole, feldspar and carbonate in these rocks. The metasomatic fluid might have \n\nbeen relatively Pb rich in relation to the gabbros but comparatively Sr and Nd poor, \n\nwhich would justify the changes in the Pb isotopic signature but not in the Sr and Nd \n\nisotopic ratios. Given the similarity of the changes in Pb isotopic compositions between \n\nthe gabbros and the upper crustal contaminant detected in the more evolved rocks, it is \n\nsuggested that the fluid derived from the upper crustal country rocks that surround the \n\n\n\n \n\n297 \n \n\nigneous complexes either by dehydration processes or simply from mobilization of \n\ninterstitial pore solutions. \n\nMagma mixing was inferred to have taken place at depth from petrographic and \n\nmineral chemistry data (see sections 6.1 and 6.2), yet it seems to have played a minor \n\nrole in the evolution of the studied rocks. In fact, the modeling of mixing between the \n\nbasic and intermediate end members postulated in section 6.2 failing to reproduce the \n\nobserved major and trace element signatures. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n298 \n \n\n8. Discussion and geodynamical implications \n \n\nThis section aims at establishing a connection between the geochronological, \n\ngeochemical and mineral chemistry data presented and discussed in the previous \n\nsections of this manuscript and integrate them with information relative to the plate \n\nmotion, the structure and tectonics of the region, in order to establish a coherent \n\ngeodynamical model that explains the occurrence of the studied alkaline magmatic \n\nepisode in the WIM during the Late Cretaceous.  \n\n8.1 The relationship between the alkaline magmatism in the WIM, hot \n\nmantle anomalies and plate kinematics \n\nThe alkaline magmatism that took place in the WIM during the Late Cretaceous \n\nis an important event in the history of the then recently formed passive margin. The \n\nvolume of erupted material of the Madeira-Tore Rise (MTR) alone is calculated to be \n\nover 105 km3 (Merle et al., 2009). The magmatism that took place between the Tore \n\nseamount and mainland Portugal and in the onshore WIM has to be added to the volume \n\nerupted in the MTR, as is also the case with the alkaline magmatism present in the other \n\nside of the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR), materialized by the Newfoundland seamounts. \n\nTogether, these occurrences total an important volume of magmatism that spreads \n\nthrough three different plates (North America, Iberia/Europe and Africa) which cannot \n\nbe easily reconciled with shallow magma generation mechanisms such as \n\ndecompression melting along deep transfer faults or even with shallow edge driven \n\nconvection, as proposed by Matton and J\u00e9br\u00e1k (2009), due to its scattered nature and the \n\nabsence of cratonic lithosphere in the region. \n\nSince the area affected by this magmatism was not undergoing contemporaneous \n\nextension, the existence of such a large volume of magma must then be related to the \n\npresence of one or several deeper, hotter and/or wetter mantle anomaly(ies) in the \n\nregion during the Late Cretaceous.  \n\nSuch melting anomalies are likely to originate in deeper, warmer parts of the \n\nmantle and correspond to mantle plumes as defined by Morgan (1971). Also, the \n\nisotopic signatures of the uncontaminated rocks in the region favor the hypothesis that \n\nthey might have derived from relatively similar sources (e.g. Geldmacher et al., 2006; \n\nMerle et al., 2006; Grange et al., 2010; this study). \n\n\n\n \n\n299 \n \n\n \nFig. 8.1: Location of some alkaline European volcanic centers projected back in time (present day, 64 Ma \nand 94 Ma positions), according to absolute plate motion in Fig. 3 of Piromallo et al. (2008). Circles \nrepresent locations of some reference areas, rather than individual centers: Eifel\u2013Bohemia (EB) and \nVosges-Massif Central (VO), exhibiting long-lived and continuous activity; Portugal\u2013Canaries (PC), \nHungary\u2013Serbia (HS), Veneto Volcanic Province (VE), Pietre Nere (PN) and Morocco (MO), \ncircumscribing the region of older activity (N55\u201360 Ma). Portugal is plotted in red to acknowledge its \nrelation to the Canaries\u2013Madeira hotspot track (i.e. Geldmacher et al., 2005). The expected paleo-\npositions at 94 Ma of the remaining areas are therefore reported with a question mark. A dashed line \nbounds the region enclosing paleo-positions of centers which erupted oldest alkali products. Background \nmap is given at 1100 km depth for two different global tomographic models: a) tx2005 (Simmons et al., \n2006), b) Karason and van der Hilst (2001). Shear-wave (a) and P-wave (b) velocity anomalies exhibit \nconsistent large-scale features at this depth in the lower mantle: low velocity anomalies encompassing \nnorth-western Africa and central-eastern Atlantic, in contrast to high velocity anomalies in Eastern \nEurope and Mediterranean and north-eastern Africa. As in Piromallo et al. (2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n300 \n \n\nThe passage of the Iberian/European plate over the regions of the mantle where \n\nthe Madeira and Canaries plumes are located during the late Cretaceous has already \n\nbeen suggested to explain the presence of the abundant alkaline magmatism in the \n\nregion. Morgan (1983) and Duncan (1984) suggested that Iberia had been positioned \n\nvery near both the Madeira and Canaries plumes during the Late Cretaceous. The \n\npaleogeographical reconstitution made by Piromallo et al. (2008) also shows the Iberian \n\nregion on top of the Canaries mantle plume at 94 Ma (fig. 8.1) \n\nThe Newfoundland seamounts (Duncan, 1984; Geldmacher et al., 2006), the \n\nalkaline rocks of the Ormonde peak in the Gorringe bank (Geldmacher et al., 2006), and \n\nthe Monchique igneous complex (Geldmacher et al., 2000) have been attributed to the \n\nmelting of Madeira plume material, while the Canaries plume has been associated with \n\nthe magmatism of (at least) the southern half of the MTR (Geldmacher et al., 2006). \n\nOther authors did not attribute this mantle anomaly to a specific plume, \n\npreferring to refer to a larger feature, such as a regional widespread mantle upwelling \n\nthe Central Atlantic, resulting on a wide, long lived thermal anomaly from which \n\nsmaller magmatic pulses develop (Merle et al., 2006, 2009; Grange et al., 2010). \n\nAccording to the authors, this feature has been generating magmatism in the Portugal-\n\nMadeira-Canaries-Azores area since the Cretaceous. Such an anomaly can correspond \n\nto the low velocity zones in the mantle identified in the mantle between the Canaries \n\nand Iberia by seismic tomography studies (e.g. Hoernle et al., 1995; Montelli, et al., \n\n2004).  \n\nPaleomagnetic data collected on some of the onshore intrusions and compiled in \n\ntable 8.1 also points towards magma cooling at paleolatitudes similar to the ones where \n\nthe Madeira and Canaries plume heads (which can be up to 2000 km in diameter, e.g. \n\nGriffiths and Campbell, 1990; Campbell, 2007), are presently located (Madeira ? \n\n32.6N; Canaries ? 27.5N), adding further strength to the relationship between these \n\nhotspots and the observed Late Cretaceous magmatism. Incidentally, these data are also \n\ncompatible, within error, with magma generation taking place on smaller, hot mantle \n\nanomalies. \n\nAdditionally, the existence of uplift and erosion that is not associated with \n\nimportant tectonic shortening in the Lusitanian basin between the Nazar\u00e9 and Arr\u00e1bida \n\nfaults (Proen\u00e7a da Cunha and Pena dos Reis, 1995; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Dinis et al., \n\n2008),  as well as thermal metamorphism and hydrothermal activity in the centre of \n\nIberia (Casquet et al., 1992; Tritlla and Sol\u00e9, 1999) pre-dating and during the onset of \n\n\n\n \n\n301 \n \n\nthe Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle support the hypothesis of the involvement of \n\nanomalously hot mantle in this event. Moreover, in the Sines region, the Late \n\nCretaceous period of slope progradation is associated with regional tilting and thermal \n\nuplift in the central proximal part of the margin (38\u00baN), most likely in association with \n\nthe contemporaneous alkaline magmatism (Alves et al., 2009). \n\n \nTable 8.1: Compilation of paleomagnetic data for the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism of the WIM. \nN corresponds to the number of samples or the number of accepted sites, D is the magnetic declination, I \nthe magnetic inclination ?95 corresponds to the 95% confidence interval for D and I and K is the best-\nestimate of the precision parameter k for the observed distribution of site-mean Virtual Geomagnetic \nPoles.

The magmatism seems to progress further SW with time, which is \n\nin accordance with general plate motion towards the NE (e.g. Piromallo et al., 2008, fig. \n\n8.1). \n\n\n\n \n\n302 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n303 \n \n\nFig. 8.2: Paleogeographical reconstitution of the evolution northern Central Atlantic from 105 to 65 Ma \n\nin relation to a fixed Europe referential.

Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\nmagmatic occurrences in orange. Figure made by Maryline Moulin. \n \n\nHowever, the lack of a clear age progression for the onshore and offshore \n\nmagmatism and the similar ages obtained for the lower volume of alkaline magmatism \n\nintruding the opposite rifted and thinned margins of the Iberian plate (105-69 Ma in the \n\nPyrenees, Basque-Cantabrian basin,  Catalan ranges, and  Galicia; Ancochea et al., \n\n1992; Carracedo et al., 1999; Fabri\u00e8s et al., 1998; Montigny et al., 1986, Sol\u00e9 et al., \n\n2003) suggest a relationship between the Late Cretaceous magmatism and the changes \n\nin plate kinematics and seafloor spreading geometry contemporaneous with the opening \n\nof the Bay of Biscay, as well as a strong structural control on the position of the onshore \n\nmagmatic occurrences, instead of a simpler model where magma generation takes place \n\non a hot mantle plume located under the moving lithosphere.  \n\nNevertheless, a model involving magma generation exclusively by \n\ndecompression associated with plate kinematics and/or movement across lithospheric \n\nstructures alone is not realistic, since these processes cannot generate the large volumes \n\nof magmas observed in the WIM. Also, the isotopic characteristics of these magmas \n\npoint towards the contribution of a hot, deep sublithospheric mantle anomaly (see \n\nsection 7.5.3). So it is therefore more likely that this magmatism is related to the \n\npresence of the Canaries hotspot in the mantle underneath region during the Late \n\nCretaceous but that plate kinematics, the structure and tectonics of the WIM play a key \n\nrole in controlling the timing, location and volume of some of these magmatic \n\noccurrences, as discussed on section 8.2. \n\n \n\n8.2 The relationship between the structure of the WIM and the \n\nlocation of the alkaline magmatism \n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, magmatism was more abundant offshore than \n\nonshore, meaning that the less voluminous onshore magmatism must have had its \n\nlocation strongly controlled by local structure, horizontal plate kinematics and tectonic \n\nprocesses, whether it originated from a wide thermal anomaly such as a mantle plume or \n\na more regional feature. The thicker continental lithosphere is also likely to have limited \n\n\n\n \n\n304 \n \n\nadiabatic melting above an ascending mantle plume or convective cell, resulting in more \n\nreduced rates of magmatic productivity under continental Iberia, in relation to oceanic \n\nor ocean-continent transitional domains. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 8.3: Location of the Sintra-Tore fault and associated small intrusions in the continental shelf. \n\nAdapted from Badagola (2008). \n\n \n\nOne structure that played a major role in controlling the location of the Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline magmatism seems to be the Sintra-Tore fault (Badagola, 2008; fig. \n\n8.3). This structure connects the 88-80 Ma (Merle et al., 2006) Tore seamounts with the \n\n80-75 Ma Sintra igneous complex (Storetvedt et al., 1987; Miranda et al., 2009) and \n\ncorresponds to the superficial expression of a deep strike slip fault whose orientation \n\nvaries between NW-SE, close to Sintra (fig. 8.3) but becomes WNW-ESE as it passes \n\nnear the Fontanelas seamount and approaches the Tore seamount (fig. 8.4). Several \n\nmagmatic features have been identified along its strike, including the Fontanelas \n\nseamount (fig. 8.4), as well as several small scale magmatic features identified by \n\nBadagola (2008) in the continental shelf between Sintra and Fontanelas (fig. 8.3).  \n\n\n\n \n\n305 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n306 \n \n\nFig. 8.4: (1) Uninterpreted seafloor morphology of the area between the Estremadura spur and Tore \n\nseamount (a and b) and of the Fontanelas seamount (c). (2) structural interpretation of the same data. \n\nBathymetric data from the GEBCO dataset (www.nbi.ac.uk), the SWIM compilation (Zitellini et al., \n2009), the CANHOES (PDCTM/MAR/56781/2004) project. Most of the bathymetry for the Estremadura \n\nspur and the area around the Fontanelas Seamount is a courtesy ofthe EMEPC.  \n\n \n\nSeveral magnetic anomalies that also possibly correspond to igneous intrusions \n\nwere identified further W of the Fontanelas seamount (e.g. Silva et al., 2000; fig. 2.2). \n\nThey do not occur in close proximity of the Sintra- Tore fault, but can be related with \n\nother minor faults in the region with similar orientations (NW-SE to E-W, fig. 8.4) \n\nOther important WNW-ESE to E-W trending structures were also identified \n\nbetween the Estremadura spur and the Tore seamount (Roque, 2009), with the present \n\nday morphology of the seamount being controlled by some of these features. These \n\nstructures are mostly thrusts and backthrusts that deform sediments up to the Pliocene-\n\nPleistocene (Roque, 2009) but have been active since at least the Cretaceous and are \n\nlikely to have an even older origin, for instance, as rift related transfer faults (C. Roque, \n\npers. comm., 2010). \n\nThe position of these important E-W structures also coincides with the proposed \n\nlocation for the offshore boundary between the Paleozoic terranes of the South \n\nPortuguese Zone and Ossa Morena Zone, which would correspond to the boundary \n\nbetween the Meguma and Avalon terranes in the conjugate Grand Banks margin (fig. \n\n8.5, Capdevila and Mougenot, 1988; Lefort et al., 1996), which is materialized by \n\nanother set of linear magnetic anomalies known as the Collector Anomaly (CA). Other \n\ngeodynamic reconstitutions of the Variscan orogeny in Iberia do not necessarily agree \n\nwith the model presented in fig. 8.5 (e.g. Ribeiro et al. 2007) but do not invalidate the \n\nhypothesis that is proposed in this section.  \n\nThe Collector Anomaly (CA) is thought to represent the suture of the Theic \n\nocean (e.g Lefort et al., 1996), but given its proximity with the Newfoundland \n\nseamounts and the recently recognized alkaline intrusions along the Sintra-Tore fault, it \n\nis possible that the positive magnetic anomalies in the Grand Banks margin can also \n\ncorrespond to Cretaceous alkaline intrusions. Such an inference is speculative since \n\nthere does not seem to be a consensus over the general position of the CA (e.g. Jansa et \n\nal., 1993; Pe-Piper et al. 1994) and whether the CA was positioned further south during \n\n\n\n \n\n307 \n \n\nthe Cretaceous (e.g. Silva et al., 2000). Thus the location of the CA needs to be \n\nconfirmed by detailed plate kinematics reconstructions and geomagnetism studies. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 8.5: Representation of the boundaries between different Paleozoic terranes in the Iberia-\n\nNewfoundland area before continental break-up.

Taken from Capdevila and Mougenot, in Boilot \n\nand Winterer (eds.), 1988. \n\n \n\nOther features, such as the offset of the magnetic J anomaly in the Estremadura \n\nSpur region (e.g. figs. 1 and 2 in Sibuet et al., 2007; fig. 6 in Srivastava et al., 2000; fig. \n\n1 in Withmarsh and Wallace, 2001) and the lack of peridotite ridges in the Tagus \n\nAbyssal plain in contrast with the Iberian Abyssal plain seem to indicate that the Sintra-\n\nTore fault, as part of the Estremadura Spur, appears to be part of a very important \n\nstructural boundary in the region that may have been crucial in facilitating the ascent \n\nand emplacement of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas in the WIM. \n\n\n\n \n\n308 \n \n\nThe recognition of the Sintra-Tore fault as an important structure of the WIM \n\nraises the question of whether other structures of the same type, or at least with the same \n\norientation, are associated with the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism. For instance, \n\nthe geometry of the feeders of the Sintra intrusion, deduced from AMS and gravimetric \n\ndata, also point towards the existence of E-W conduits, along with others with NE-SW \n\nand NW-SE directions (Terrinha et al., 2003; Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010). \n\n \n\n  \nFig. 8.6: Locationof the main structures in the Sintra-Arr\u00e1bida region.

From Kullberg et al., 2006. \n \n\nAlso, the Sintra igneous complex, in addition to being located on the Sintra-Tore \n\nfault, is affected by a late thrust with an approximately E-W direction and is located at \n\nthe intersection of these structures with other faults trending NW-SE to N-S (figs. 8.5 \n\nand 8.6). It is possible that this thrust acted earlier as a transfer or normal fault and later \n\nas a conduit for magma ascent before basin inversion took place and reactivated with \n\nthe presently observed kinematic (Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010). This structure is thought \n\n\n\n \n\n309 \n \n\nto continue towards the East, between Sintra and the Tagus river, in the form of a blind \n\nthrust whose surface expression is the fold with an E-W axis that occurs in the Loures \n\nregion, where many of the LVC\u2019s flows and necks outcrop (fig. 8.6). \n\nIn the Lisbon region, the Monsanto anticline, the Torres Vedras and Tagus \n\nestuary fault are other important structures showing the same general E-W trend and are \n\nlocated near the region where most of the rocks from the LVC outcrop.  \n\nThe alkaline Foz da Fonte and Sesimbra sills are located not too far away from \n\nthe Arr\u00e1bida fault, which corresponds to the southern limit of the Lusitanian basin and \n\nis interpreted as being an important, E-W oriented structure thought to have acted as a \n\nnormal/transfer fault during rifting (e.g. Kullberg, 2000; Kullberg et al., 2010). \n\nHowever, magnetic lineation and imbrications in the Foz da Fonte sill indicate a WSW-\n\nENE flow direction which can be indicative of the presence of a linear feeder with a \n\nNNE-SSW direction,instead of E-W (Miranda et al., 2006). \n\nThe Torres Vedras, Arr\u00e1bida and Tagus estuary faults are all important \n\nstructures in the region, limiting different half grabens or sub-basins inside the larger \n\nLusitanian basin (Ribeiro et al., 1979; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Kullberg, 2000; Alves et \n\nal., 2003). They are consequentially thought to correspond to syn-rift transfer faults \n\nshowing an oblique movement that were reactivated as thrust and reverse faults during \n\nthe Alpine orogeny. These can therefore be considered important crustal discontinuities \n\nthat might have played a large role of facilitating the ascent of the alkaline magmas \n\nduring the Late Cretaceous. \n\nThe Sines igneous complex is located on the Southern border of the small \n\nSantiago do Cac\u00e9m Mesozoic basin, which should contact with the surrounding \n\nPaleozoic basement through an approximately E-W fault. Furthermore, the complex is \n\ncut by structures with the roughly the same direction (e.g. Inverno et al., 1993; fig. \n\n2.11). NNW-SSE faults, such as the Santo Andr\u00e9 fault, are also important in the region \n\nas they define the limits of the previously mentioned basin (e.g. Inverno et al., 1993) \n\nIn the southern Monchique igneous complex, Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares \n\n(2003) proposed that magma ascension and installation was controlled by pre existing \n\nleft strike slip ENE-WSW faults, while other authors (Gomes and Pereira, 2004; \n\nSant\u2019Ovaia et al., 2007) argue for the existence of NW-SE feeders on the basis of AMS \n\nand paleomagnetic data. Important structures in the region include the nearby NNW-\n\nSSE Portim\u00e3o fault and structures with NNE-SSW directions that offset the complex \n\n(Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, 2003). \n\n\n\n \n\n310 \n \n\nThe scattered intrusions in the Algarve basin appear associated with salt diapirs \n\n(Loul\u00e9 dykes), normal faults (Praia do Zavial), N-S to NNW-SSE oriented faults (Lagos \n\nregion) and can even intrude E-W structures in the Western Algarve (Romariz et al., \n\n1979; Terrinha, 1998). \n\nThe variety of different structures involved in controlling the ascent and \n\nemplacement of these magmas and acting as feeders in the larger intrusions at upper \n\ncrustal levels implies that these alkaline magmas used pre-existing, possibly rift related \n\nstructures to make their way up to the surface. Many of these pre-existing structures \n\nshould have been inherited from existing fractures in the Variscan basement (Terrinha, \n\n1998; Kullberg, 2000) and could therefore extend to deep crustal levels. Nevertheless, \n\nthe persistent identification of E-W transfer faults associated with the Late Cretaceous \n\nmagmatic products in the Lusitanian basin suggests a higher importance of these \n\nstructures in controlling the ascension of the magmas. Meanwhile, the actual location of \n\nthe major magmatic occurrences seems to be controlled by the intersection of such \n\nfaults with other NNW-SSE or NE-SW fractures.  \n\nIt has been suggested that the Sintra, Sines and Monchique complexes are \n\nconnected at deeper levels (lower crust and subcontinental mantle lithosphere), by a \n\nNNW-SSE trending dextral strike slip fault related to the rotation of Iberia (Ribeiro et \n\nal., 1979; Terrinha, 1998). Alternatively, it has been put forward that the Sintra-Tore \n\nand Sintra-Sines-Monchique (SSM) faults share a common origin, related to the super-\n\ncritical propagation of a lithospheric fracture resulting from a meteorite impact in the \n\nTore Seamount area (Ribeiro et al., 1997, Ribeiro, 2002). These authors propose that the \n\nchange in direction from approximately E-W to NNW-SSE is the result of the refraction \n\nof fault propagation due to changes in the thickness and rheology of the lithosphere \n\nbeing crossed, that progressively changes from very thinned (Tore), to thinned (Sintra) \n\nto probably unthinned (Monchique). \n\nThe existence of the Sintra-Sines-Monchique (SSM) fault is yet to be confirmed \n\nby either direct observation of indirect geophysical methods. When compared to the \n\nSintra-Tore fault, which is observed at the surface and in seismic profiles (Badagola, \n\n2008), the evidence for the existence of the SSM fault is not obvious. Nonetheless, a \n\nseries of smaller scale fractures with the same NNW-SSE strike of the SSM fault have \n\nbeen identified in the Lusitanian and Algarve basins (Terrinha, 1998; Kullberg et al., \n\n2006, 2010; fig. 8.6), and close to the Sintra and Monchique igneous complexes.  \n\n\n\n \n\n311 \n \n\nA NW-SE trending fault zone with approximately 50 km of length has been \n\nidentified between the Sintra complex and the Miocene Arr\u00e1bida thrust belt (Kullberg, \n\n2000; Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010). These faults cut across the Lower Cretaceous \n\nsediments, and also the Foz da Fonte sill. Kullberg (2000) has shown that these \n\nstructures were active during Mid Jurassic rifting in the Arr\u00e1bida belt. Also, they are \n\noften injected with basic to intermediate dykes (the Oeiras-Cascais dykes). \n\nThe Portim\u00e3o fault was mapped from the vicinities of the Monchique complex, \n\ntill approximately 100 km further south, already in the offshore domain (Terrinha et al., \n\n1999; Terrinha et al., 2009). This structure is a steep strike slip fault at present, but it \n\nwas active at least since Mid Jurassic times, separating two sub-basins in the main \n\nAlgarve basin (Terrinha, 1998; Terrinha et al., 1999). \n\nThese two fault zones were interpreted as the surface expression of the deeper \n\nSSM strike-slip fault that concentrated shear during the rotation of Iberia and controlled \n\nthe ascent of the alkaline magmas (e.g. Terrinha, 1998; Terrinha et al., 2003; Kullberg \n\net al., 2006, 2010).  \n\nIn summary, the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas seem to have used of a \n\nseries of pre-existing structures in order to extrude or ascend to upper crustal levels, \n\nnoticeably E-W to WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE and NE-SW trending faults. In the \n\nuppermost crustal levels, the intersection of these fault systems controlled the location \n\nof individual occurrences, as can be deduced from the geometry of the feeders in Sintra \n\n(Terrinha et al., 2003; Kullberg et al., 2006; 2010) and from the main structures present \n\nin the vicinities of both this and the Sines igneous complex. In its turn magma ascent in \n\nthe Monchique igneous complex is thought to have taken place in reactivated Variscan \n\nWNW-ESE to NW-SE structures in the upper crust. \n\nIn the Lusitanian basin, the Estremadura spur and possibly even in the case of \n\nthe Sines igneous complex, the E-W to WNW-ESE structures seem to have played a \n\nmajor role in controlling the ascent of these magmas. Since many of these are thought to \n\nhave acted as transfer faults during rifting and also correspond to reactivated structures \n\ninherited from the Variscan orogen, they can be thought of as extending to relatively \n\nhigh depths in the lithosphere, at least until the lower crust and to control the magma \n\nascent, as previously suggested by Terrinha (1998). \n\nAt the lower crust and subcontinental mantle lithosphere levels, the debate \n\nremains relatively open, in the sense that both the WNW-ESE to E-W faults in the Tore-\n\nEstremadura region and the hypothetical NNW-SSE SSM fault are viable pathways for \n\n\n\n \n\n312 \n \n\nrising magmas, although their extension to such depths cannot be unequivocally \n\ndemonstrated at present.  \n\n \n\n8.3 Towards an integrated geodynamical model for the Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline magmatism of the WIM \n\nThe geochronological evidence for the existence of two pulses of alkaline \n\nmagmatism was presented in section 5 of this work (see also Miranda et al., 2009). It \n\nwas also shown that these two pulses are distinguishable in terms of trace element \n\nabundances (section 7.1), but derived from mantle source with a nearly identical \n\nsublithospheric mantle isotopic signature (sections 7.2 and 7.5). \n\nMeanwhile, Grange et al. (2010) argued for the existence of an age progression \n\nin their dataset, with the intrusions younging towards the south. They interpret this age \n\nprogression to reflect the movement of the Iberian plate above a fixed mantle plume. \n\nHowever, this implies that the plate has to move in from SSE to NNW between 88 and \n\n68 Ma (Grange et al., 2010), while in fact the western part of the Iberian plate moves \n\nfrom NW to SE up to 80 Ma as a consequence of the opening of the Bay of Biscay \n\n(Sibuet et al., 2004), and shows an overall northwards (? SW to NE) motion from then \n\nonwards, as the opening of the Bay of Biscay ends and Iberia starts moving in the same \n\ndirection as Europe (e.g Piromallo et al., 2008). Even if the overall SW to NE motion \n\nwas predominant during the Late Cretaceous, the igneous complexes should be aligned \n\nin a NE-SW direction, while their actual alignment is NNW-SSE. Also, the \n\ninterpretation by Grange et al. (2010) does not account for a younger event in the \n\nLisbon area at 72 Ma, which could not reflect the northwards drift of Iberia above a \n\nmantle plume.  \n\nMoreover, the occurrence of magmatic of activity in the same location at \n\ndifferent time intervals (in the Lisbon region there is alkaline magmatism at 94-88 Ma \n\nand later 75-72 Ma, with the Sintra granite intruding in between at 79 Ma), the \n\nsimultaneous activity in different locations at approximately the same time (Algarve, \n\nSines and Lisboa between 75-72), the Late Cretaceous kinematics of the Iberian plate \n\nand the absence of an age progression in the offshore WIM magmatism favor the \n\nhypothesis of the occurrence of two distinct pulses of activity on the onshore WIM \n\ninstead of a simple N to S age progression.  \n\n\n\n \n\n313 \n \n\nAs discussed in section 7, the enriched nature of the Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\nmagmas point towards and OIB like source. This type of sources is usually located in \n\nthe sublithospheric mantle and is associated with deep rooted upwelling from lower \n\nparts of this layer, in the form of mantle plumes (e.g. Morgan, 1971). \n\nThe isotopic characteristics of the uncontaminated sampled rocks (87Sr/86Sri  \n\n0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7 \u2013 3.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-15.580, \n208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00) are compatible with a common origin between these magmas \n\nand the melts from the Canaries mantle plume. Considering that the known \n\npaleomagnetic data and paleogeographic reconstitutions indicate that Iberia was located \n\nin the vicinities of the Canaries mantle plume during the Late Cretaceous (see section \n\n8.1), it can be argued that this hot mantle anomaly is a long living one and that it was \n\nthe heat and mass source of the alkaline magmatism of the WIM. \n\nDuring the first pulse of alkaline activity in the onshore WIM (94-88 Ma), the \n\nsublithospheric, plume related magmas represented by the Foz da Fonte sill were \n\ninstalled in the upper crust without traces of interaction with the mantle lithosphere or \n\nwith the crust. In its turn, the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill is constituted by magmas that suffered e \n\nimportant assimilation of crustal material and fractional crystallization. \n\nSamples from the second pulse (75-72 Ma) show distinct trace element patterns \n\nin relation to the first one. The differences observed between the two pulses can be \n\nrelated to different levels of interaction of sublithospheric plume magmas with the \n\noverlying continental mantle lithosphere as a consequence of changes observed in the \n\nIberian plate motion. It is suggested that the lack of a metasomatic signature during the \n\nfirst pulse is linked to a more favorable stress field during the rotation of Iberia (up to \n\n80 Ma, Sibuet et al., 2004), which allowed for the quick ascent of the magmas generated \n\nin an ascending plume.  \n\nThe second pulse coincided with the onset of the rapid collision between the \n\nAfrican and Iberian plates and the first recorded phases of inversion of the Mesozoic \n\nbasins (e.g. Mougenot, 1980, Terrinha, 1998, Rosembaum et al., 2002) which started \n\nafter the rotation had ceased. This created a less favorable stress regime and restrained \n\nthe opening of fractures and quick magmatic ascent, favoring interaction with \n\nsubcontinental lithosphere which either resulted in the metasomatism of its lowermost \n\npart, or allowed for the melting and incorporation of lithosphere that had been probably \n\nmetasomatized during the first pulse. \n\n\n\n \n\n314 \n \n\nThe metasomatizing agents were probably the first volatile rich (H2O+CO2) low \n\ndegree melts from the ascending Canaries plume. These early melts metasomatized the \n\noverlying subcontinental mantle, imprinting the plume signature and lowering the \n\nfusion temperatures of these rocks. It is the similarity in the isotopic signatures observed \n\nin both pulses that allows the assignment of common origins to the sublithospheric and \n\nmetasomatic components. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 8.7: Schematic representation of the interplay between structure and magmatism during the Late \n\nCretaceous in the WIM. Adapted from Kullberg et al., 2010. \n\n \n\nLater, when these rocks crossed their solidus either due to the higher proximity \n\nof the plume\u2019s hot center or to the passage of other plume derived melts, the \n\nmetasomatized lithosphere started to melt, contributing to the volume of magma \n\ngenerated during the second pulse. The metasomatic signature is reflected only in the \n\nmagmas derived from smaller amounts of partial melting, since it becomes \n\nprogressively more diluted with time, as the liquids generated in the asthenosphere from \n\nthe melting of the plume head increase in volume. This metasomatic signature is \n\ncharacterized by negative K, Zr, Hf and sometimes Ti anomalies in the multielemental \n\ndiagrams, accompanied by low Ti/Eu, and high Zr/Hf. \n\nAs the magmas from the first pulse (or early magmas from the second pulse) \n\nascended, some became trapped at depths corresponding to the upper mantle or lower \n\ncrust, where they started to crystallize, among other minerals, clinopyroxene and \n\namphibole, thus evolving from basic to at least intermediate compositions (see section \n\n6.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n315 \n \n\nDuring the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline activity, some of the \n\nchambers or conduits where these magmas evolved were recharged with a more \n\nprimitive batch of basanitic magma which mixed with the more evolved liquid they \n\ncontained, creating the reversely zoned crystals observed in some of the Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM (see section 6.2). During these recharge events \n\nthe mixing of a hot, basic magma with a more evolved, volatile rich melt led to the \n\npressurization and reduction in density of the basic magmas aiding the quick ascent of \n\nthese magmas. The higher volatile content of the resulting magmas could have also \n\nfacilitated the ascent to shallower levels, possibly leading to the extrusion of the LVC, \n\nwhich is characterized by the occurrence of explosive events before the onset of the \n\neffusive activity. The explosive events of the LVC can be tentatively related to \n\ndecompression and devolatilization of a volatile rich magma. \n\nAlthough mineral chemistry data seems to show that magma mixing is a \n\nrelatively common phenomenon in the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM, it \n\ndid not have a major influence in the isotopic or major and trace element characteristics \n\nof the rocks where it is recorded. This leads to the proposition that the mixed magmas \n\nwere probably related to a common source and that only a small volume of intermediate \n\nmelt mixed with the primitive basic liquid (see sections 6.2 and 7.3.3). \n\nDuring their ascent, these magmas used pre-existing faults inherited from \n\nMesozoic rifting and the Paleozoic Variscan orogeny. Many of the magmatic \n\noccurrences in the western Mesozoic basins seem to be related to WNW-ESE to E-W \n\ntransfer faults that were active during rifting (fig. 8.7). Meanwhile, their exact site of \n\nemplacement seems to result from the intersection of these structures with other fault \n\nsystems with NE-SW and NNW-SSE orientations.  \n\nSome of the previously mentioned E-W to WNW-ESE structures might \n\nrepresent major lithospheric discontinuities and acted as preferential pathways for \n\nmagma ascent and emplacement, as seems to be the case with the Sintra-Tore faults, \n\nalong which several intrusions are found, including the Sintra igneous complex and the \n\nFontanelas seamount, among several other minor intrusives. \n\nMany of these magmas did not reach the surface but instead accumulated as sills \n\nand laccoliths in upper crustal levels and evolved through combined assimilation and \n\nfractional crystallization processes. Crystal fractionation led to the formation of \n\ncumulate rocks in the larger intrusive bodies, either by gravitational settling (e.g. Pedras \n\n\n\n \n\n316 \n \n\nNegras gabbro in the Sines complex) or by flotation processes (e.g. \n\nbenmoreite/monzonite layers of the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas sill). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 8.8: Schematic representation of the evolution of the WIM during the Late Cretaceous. a) at ? 100 \n\nMa, before the onset of magmatism; b) at  ? 88 Ma, during the first pulse of alkaline magmatic activity \n\nand c) at ? 75 Ma during the second pulse of alkaline magmatic activity. Adapted from Alves et al., 2009. \n\n \n\nThe energy provided by conductive cooling of the intrusions and by \n\ncrystallization allowed for the assimilation of the country rock. The contaminants are \n\nthought to be of upper crustal nature and the two different contamination trends \n\nobserved in the data set relate to the different nature of the assimilated material. The \n\nhigher 87Sr/86Sr, 207Pb/204Pb  and lower 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb trend is \n\nthought to reflect contamination from siliclastic sedimentary material, while the trend \n\nthat is characterized only by a rise in 87Sr/86Sr might be related to the assimilation of \n\nsmall amounts of Sr rich and Nd poor carbonated material. The high 207Pb/204Pb of the \n\n\n\n \n\n317 \n \n\nsiliciclastic contaminant suggests that this contaminant has inherited an old, \n\nPrecambrian crustal component. \n\nThe scatter observed in the ages for both the onshore and offshore Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline occurrences is also indicative of the importance of the plate \n\nkinematics of Iberia, pre-existing structure and the size of the hot mantle anomaly in \n\ncontrolling the timing and location of this magmatism (fig. 8.8). Most of the seamounts \n\nin the Madeira-Tore rise were active (103 Ma to 80 Ma, Merle et al., 2006, 2009; \n\nGeldmacher et al., 2006) during the time interval when the opening of the bay of Biscay \n\nand the rotation of Iberia took place (? 118 -80 Ma, Sibuet et al., 2004). These \n\nseamounts extruded on a major lithospheric discontinuity that defines the passage from \n\na transitional continental domain constituted mostly by exhumed peridotite, to true \n\noceanic crust, as schematically shown on fig. 8.7 and 8.8 (e.g. Sibuet et al., 2007; \n\nAfilhado et al., 2010). During the rotation of Iberia, this discontinuity might have \n\nworked as a lithospheric strike slip fault and facilitated the ascent of the magmas along \n\nits strike, especially in areas where it intersected other structures or where small changes \n\nin its general trend might have led to the onset of transtension. The simultaneous \n\nmagmatism in the Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas and Foz da Fonte intrusions and possibly also in the \n\nSintra complex (the granite intrudes at ca. 79 Ma) can be related to the channeling of \n\nplume material from the Tore area, where significant magmatism took place, through \n\ncorridors of thinned lithosphere or along the E-W to WNW-ESE structures of the \n\nEstremadura spur. The Newfoundland seamounts, which erupted on the American plate \n\nbut in an area where similar E-W to WNW-ESE structures might be present, show a \n\nsimilar age of 98 Ma (Sullivan and Keen, 1977 in Pe-Piper et al., 2007). \n\nFrom 80 Ma to the end of the Cretaceous, the offshore magmatism in the WIM \n\nseems to be limited to the Ormonde peak of the Gorringe bank (? 65 Ma, F\u00e9raud et al., \n\n1982, 1986) although the NW Tore seamount shows a 80.5 Ma age (Merle et al., 2006). \n\nOn the other hand, this was the time when magmatism was most abundant in the \n\nonshore WIM, which might reflect the drift of Iberia over a hotter area of the mantle \n\n(fig. 8.8). The small amount of magma production in the onshore with respect to the \n\noffshore is likely to be related both to the higher thickness of the lithosphere in this \n\nregion, which held back magma production by decompression, and to the contemporary \n\ntectonic regime characterized by compression due to the initiation of collision between \n\nAfrica and Iberia/Europe. \n\n\n\n \n\n318 \n \n\nAs was mentioned earlier, the most likely source for the Late Cretaceous \n\nalkaline magmatism of the WIM seems to have been the Canaries mantles plume (see \n\nsection 7.4), however, it remains unclear if it continued to affect the region throughout \n\nthe duration of both pulses or if at some point the metasomatized lithosphere bearing the \n\nCanaries plume isotopic and trace element signature melted to generate the magmas of \n\nthe second pulse. If it was the latter case, an additional heat source was necessary to \n\nmelt the refertilized lithosphere. That heat source might have speculatively been the \n\nMadeira mantle plume. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n319 \n \n\n9. Conclusions \n \n\nAfter a careful analysis of the new geochronological, geochemical and mineral \n\nchemistry data and of the elaboration of a model for the geodynamic evolution of Iberia \n\non the previous sections, this part of the manuscript will act as an extended summary of \n\nthe present work and list the main conclusions from each of these sections. \n\n \n\nSampling: \n\n \n\u2022 The sampling, analysis and study of the basaltic (s.l.) pillow lavas of the \n\nFontanelas seamount suggest that the positive magnetic anomalies (one of which \n\ncorresponds to the Fontanelas seamount) between the Tore seamount and the Sintra \n\nigneous complex could correspond to Late Cretaceus alkaline igneous occurrences. \n\n \nGeochronology: \n\n \n\u2022 The new age determinations, combined with previously published data, \n\nallowed to constrain the duration of the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle to circa 22 \n\nMa, between 94 and 72 Ma, and to define two distinct pulses of alkaline magmatic \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\u2022 The first of these pulses occurred between 94-88 Ma and is limited to \n\nsills in the Lisbon region (Foz da Fonte and Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas). The second pulse \n\ninvolved a larger volume of magma and took place between 75-72 Ma. It has a \n\nwider geographical distribution (? 37 to 39\u00ba N) and more diverse modes of \n\noccurrence such as subvolcanic complexes (Sines, Monchique and the Cabo da Roca \n\ncomplex in Sintra), flows, necks, plugs, dykes and sills (LVC, Loul\u00e9 lamprophyres). \n\n \n\u2022 U-Pb dating of zircon separates from the Sintra granite gives an 79.2 \u00b1 \n\n0.8 Ma age, which although equivalent, within error, to the oldest age obtained for \n\nthe syenite (78.3 \u00b1 1.9 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987), is still older than the other K-Ar \n\nages obtained for these rocks (76.4 \u00b1 1.4 and 76.1 \u00b1 1.1 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987). \n\nThis, combined with the observed field cross-cutting relations and geophysical data \n\n(gravimetry and AMS, Terrinha et al., 2003), allows us to speculate that the granite \n\n\n\n \n\n320 \n \n\ncorresponds to an older laccolith that is intruded by a more recent gabbro to syenite \n\nsuite. \n\n \nPetrography and Mineral Chemistry: \n\n \n\u2022 Field, textural and mineral and whole rock chemistry data indicate that \n\nthe Pedras Negras gabbro in the Sines igneous complex formed by the accumulation \n\nof mafic minerals (mostly olivine and clinopyroxene) on the bottom of a magma \n\nchamber. The Praia Vasco da Gama gabbro in the same complex should in its turn \n\nrepresent a higher level of the same magma chamber, which is supported by textural \n\nand whole rock geochemistry evidence. The fact that the deeper level of the magma \n\nchamber represented by the Pedras Negras gabbro outcrops at the same altitude than \n\nits shallower counterpart (Praia Vasco da Gama gabbro) can be due to the uplift on \n\nthe northern block accommodated by the E-W fault that cross cuts the complex. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Petrographic evidence shows that the earlier minerals to crystallize \n\nare Cr-rich spinels, followed by olivine and Fe-Ti oxides and then by \n\nclinopyroxene, plagioclase and amphibole. \n\n \n\u2022 The precipitation and removal of olivine led to the decrease of MgO \n\nand Ni and an increase of FeO in the residual melt, which is reflected in the \n\nprogressive increase of the fayalite content in the olivines. The decreasing \n\namounts of CaO and MnO in the olivines, with increasing Fa contents, are \n\nassociated to the onset of clinopyroxene, plagioclase and possibly Fe-Ti oxides \n\ncrystallization. \n\n \n\u2022 The importance of crystal accumulation processes in the genesis of \n\nthe Sines gabbros was reinforced by the observation that their ????/??\n??????  value did \n\nnot reflect equilibrium between the composition of the olivines and the analyzed \n\nwhole rock composition. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Crystallization temperatures obtained for olivine vary between 1250\u00ba C \n\nin the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug and 1150 \u00baC for the and Negrais lava flow. The \n\ntemperatures for plagioclase crystallization (? 900\u00ba C for the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plug \n\n\n\n \n\n321 \n \n\nand 970\u00ba C for the Negrais flow) and for equilibrium amphibole-plagioclase pairs \n\nare lower, confirming that these are late magmatic phases. \n\n \n\u2022 Most of the clinopyroxenes present in the analyzed rocks are Ca-rich \n\ndiopsides and augites. In general, the clinopyroxene compositions evolve towards \n\nterms that are more enriched in FeO (ferrosilitic molecule; Fe2Si2O6) and Na2O, \n\nwhile becoming progressively depleted in MgO. Some of the more Fe-rich \n\nclinopyroxenes classify as hedenbergites and, when Na2O rich as aegirine-augites. \n\n \n\u2022 Two different types of clinopyroxene phenocrysts were identified. One \n\nwith normal zoning, consisting of a pink to purple core and a rim with a darker \n\nshade of the same color. The second type shows a green core and a pink to purple \n\nrim. \n\n \n\u2022 The green cored clinopyroxenes phenocrysts show reverse zoning, with \n\nthe cores being more Fe3+, and Na rich and Mg and Ti poor than their rims and \n\nmantles. These cores also show higher Alvi which are indicative of crystallization at \n\nhigher pressures. This suggests that the reverse zonation results from the mixture \n\nbetween a more evolved and a more basic magma at depth, both being of alkaline \n\nnature and thus possibly genetically related. The differences in composition between \n\nthe green cores of the reversely zoned phenocrysts of basic rocks and the green \n\nclinopyroxenes of the Monchique nepheline syenite imply that the more evolved \n\nliquid would not be phonolitic but possibly intermediate, such as a tephri-phonolite \n\nor phono-tephrite. \n\n \n\u2022 There are compositional similarities between the clinopyroxenes in the \n\nxenoliths and the green cores of the reversely zoned phenocrysts, suggesting a \n\ncommon origin. \n\n \n\u2022 Like the clinopyroxenes, some of the plagioclases in the basic rocks also \n\nshow reverse zoning, which is further evidence for the occurrence of magma mixing \n\nat depth.  \n\n \n\u2022 Average crystallization temperatures for plagioclases are lower than the \n\nones obtained for olivines, which is in agreement with this mineral being a later \n\n\n\n \n\n322 \n \n\nphase in the crystallization sequence. Crystallization temperatures for crystal cores \n\nof gabbroic rocks vary between ?1100\u00ba C in the Mafra gabbro to 910\u00ba C in the \n\nMonchique gabbro, with Sines and Sintra showing intermediate temperatures ( 1070 \n\nand 960\u00ba C, respectively) and the more evolved sills showing even lower \n\ntemperatures (960-900\u00ba C). Matrix crystals from basic rocks show relatively high \n\ntemperatures (1040 to 900\u00ba C) as a result of their fast growth under rapid cooling \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\u2022 The amphiboles found in the studied samples are mostly kaersutites and \n\npargasites. Some show reverse zoning, providing aditional evidence for the \n\noccurrence of magma mixing processes. Secondary magnesio-horneblende occurs in \n\nthe Sintra gabbros. \n\n \n\u2022 Amphibole-plagioclase equilibrium temperatures are in agreement with \n\nthe ones calculated for plagioclase alone and reinforce the late character of both \n\nthese phases. They vary between ? 1010, 1030, 1000 and 910\u00ba C for the Mafra, \n\nSines, Monchique and Sintra gabbros and 890\u00ba C in the amygdulae of the Ribeira \n\nd\u2019Ilhas plug. \n\n \n\u2022 Compositional similarities between amphibole xenocrysts, amphiboles in \n\nthe xenoliths and the cores of the reversely zoned phenocrysts found in the Malveira \n\nda Serra sill suggest a common origin for these phases. \n\n \n\u2022 The majority of the analyzed oxides are titanomagnetites but there are \n\nalso rare, early chromian spinels, often included in olivine. In addition to these \n\nphases, some magnetite and ilmenite were identified in large exsolved crystals \n\nwhich are more common in the intrusive rocks. These exsolved crystals were likely \n\noriginally titanomagnetites as well. The predominance of spinels from the \n\nulvospinel-magnetite solid solution series is a consequence of the low silica activity \n\n(?????) of the silica undersaturated alkaline magmas from which they formed. \n\nIndividual ilmenite crystals are only found in the more evolved, contaminated and \n\nSiO2 rich sills like Pa\u00e7o d\u2019Ilhas and Montelevar. \n\n \n\u2022 The crystallization of the earlier spinels (chromite to chromian \n\ntitanomagnetite and titanomagnetites) must have taken place at relatively high \n\n\n\n \n\n323 \n \n\noxygen fugacity conditions, above the NNO buffer, since solid solution between \n\naluminous and Fe-Ti spinels seems to be possible only under such conditions. \n\n \n\u2022 With increasing differentiation, the spinels became richer in TiO2, which \n\ncan be attributed to a decrease in fO2 of these low ????? magmas. This decrease is \n\nconfirmed by the values obtained for the exsolved ilmenite-magnetite pairs in the \n\ngabbros and basaltic rocks which are generally below the NNO buffer. \n\n \n\u2022 The Sintra gabbros show the highest oxigen fO2 values for the magnetite-\n\nilmenite exsolution pairs, which is probably a result of subsolidus equilibration \n\nduring the secondary alteration event that affected the gabbros in this complex. \n\n \n\u2022 The calculated blocking temperatures for the exsolved ilmenite-magnetite \n\npairs are quite low, both for the intrusive and extrusive rocks, suggesting subsolidus \n\nequilibration under relatively slow cooling conditions in both environments. \n\nBlocking temperatures vary between 500 and 600\u00ba C in the Negrais lava flow and \n\nSines gabbro, go up to 640\u00ba C in the Monchique gabbro and 770\u00ba C in the Sintra \n\ngabbro. The highest blocking temperatures were calculated for the Montelevar sill \n\n(? 770\u00ba C) and for the oxides in the reaction rim of an amphibole megacryst in the \n\nRibeira d\u2019Ilhas plug (? 850\u00ba C). \n\n \n\u2022 Kaersutite xenocrysts are interpreted to represent the products of high \n\npressure crystallization (> 15 kbar) of a similar basic, hydrous alkaline melt, formed \n\nwithin a deep conduit or chamber, and that therefore did not aggregate into \n\nxenoliths. As the magmas ascended, the pressure dropped, and the volatiles \n\nexsolved, the amphibole xenocrysts became unstable and started developing the \n\nobserved clinopyroxene+plagioclase+Fe-Ti oxide reaction rims. \n\n \n\u2022 The existence of reversely zoned clinopyroxenes, amphiboles, \n\nplagioclase and xenoliths, sometimes even in the same outcrop, can be interpreted as \n\nevidence for the occurrence of magma mixing preceding the emplacement of the \n\nmagmas at higher levels. All these are relatively evolved and can be interpreted as \n\nbeing the crystallization products from similar alkaline melts of intermediate nature. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n324 \n \n\n\u2022 The magma mixing event must have taken place at high depth, given the \n\nhigher Alvi content of the green cores in clinopyroxenes and the stability conditions \n\nfor kaersutite. Such depths are likely to correspond to boundaries between layers \n\nwith strong density contrasts, such as the crust-mantle boundary or the Conrad \n\ndiscontinuity within the crust. \n\n \n\u2022 The green clinopyroxene cores, the evolved amphibole cores and \n\nmegacrysts and the evolved plagioclase cores are thought to represent phases \n\ncrystallizing in the middle of the chamber or conduit that contained the more \n\nevolved magma that mixed with the basic melt. In their turn, the xenoliths \n\ncontaining minerals with similar compositions could represent cumulus or wall rock \n\nassemblages in that chamber or conduit that had previously crystallized from the \n\nsame evolved magma and were remobilized once that chamber was recharged with \n\nthe basic melt.  \n\n \n \n\nElemental and Isotope Geochemistry: \n\n \n\u2022 All of the sampled rocks classify as alkaline and most of them belong to \n\nthe potassic series, although some of them plot in the sodic field of the classification \n\nby Middlemost (1975), mostly due to the accumulation of Na-rich phases. They are \n\ntrace element enriched in relation to the primitive mantle.  \n\n \n\u2022 Major and trace element abundance in cumulate rocks is controlled by \n\nthe respective cumulate mineral assemblage and degree of fractionation. This is \n\nmore evident in intrusive rocks, such as the Sines and Sintra gabbros and the Pa\u00e7o \n\nd\u2019Ilhas sill. \n\n \n\u2022 The magmatic evolution follows two distinct differentiation trends from \n\nan initial ultrabasic/basic alkaline melt. The silica oversaturated trend seems to be \n\npredominant, being common to the LVC, Sintra and Sines igneous complexes, while \n\nthe SiO2 undersaturated trend only occurs in the Monchique igneous complex and is \n\nalso represented by the Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill, which is integrated in the LVC. \n\n \n\u2022 All the samples show fractionated REE patterns, which is illustrated by \n\nhigh LaN/YbN (48.9 \u2013 8.8) and TbN/YbN (3.4-1.9). This can be interpreted as \n\n\n\n \n\n325 \n \n\nresulting from the presence of residual garnet during the melting events, which \n\nimplies that melting must have taken place deeper than 60 km. \n\n \n\u2022 The studied samples show relatively low 87Sr/86Sri (0.703005 to \n\n0.704884) and high ?Ndi (5.8 to2.8). \n\n \n\u2022 Pb isotopes show compositions (206Pb/204Pbi, 18.827-19.564, 207Pb/204Pbi \n\n15.567-15.634, 208Pb/204Pbi 38.603-39.948) that are more enriched than DMM, but \n\nless enriched than HIMU, defining a compositional array close to the NHRL and to \n\nthe FOZO component. Samples for the Fontanelas seamount show much higher \n208Pb/204Pbi values than the remaining samples, probably due to secondary alteration \n\nprocesses which changed the Th/Pb and U/Pb ratios of these rocks and prevented the \n\napplication of proper corrections for radioactive decay. \n\n \n\u2022 Basic, uncontaminated samples show a more reduced compositional \n\nrange in Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7 \u2013 3.7; \n206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00). \n\nThere are no perceptible differences in the isotopic compositions of the rocks from \n\nthe two different magmatic pulses, which means that the composition of the mantle \n\nof the WIM can be considered as being reasonably stable and homogenous between \n\n94 and 72 Ma.  \n\n \n\u2022 The basic, unfractionated samples seem to have resulted from very low \n\namounts of partial melting (1-6 %) of enriched mantle sources. The sources for the \n\nLoul\u00e9 lamprophyres, Foz da Fonte sill and remaining unfractionated basic rocks \n\n(mostly from the LVC and Fontanelas seamount) are different in terms of the degree \n\nof enrichment and of residual mineralogy. The source of the lamprophyres is \n\nsubstantially more LREE enriched, while the Foz da Fonte sill lacks residual \n\namphibole in its source. \n\n \n\u2022 The Sr and Nd isotopic signatures of the basic uncontaminated rocks \n\nsuggest a time integrated depletion in Rb and Nd relative to Sr and Sm, respectively. \n\nThis is in contrast with the incompatible trace element enriched nature of these \n\nrocks. Such a discrepancy can be attributed to a mantle metasomatism event took \n\nplace shortly before magma generation, which means that the isotopic ratios of this \n\n\n\n \n\n326 \n \n\nmetasomatized source did not have sufficient time to evolve into a more \n\nsignificantly enriched and heterogenous composition. \n\n \n\u2022 The isotopic signature of uncontaminated rocks is compatible with a \n\nsublithospheric origin for these magmas. Their composition plots between the range \n\ndefined by the HIMU and DMM components, near FOZO, in Sr-Nd, and Pb-Pb \n\nisotopic variation diagrams and shows similarities to the offshore occurrences of \n\nLate Cretaceous age (MTR and Ormonde). \n\n \n\u2022 The uncontaminated samples show an isotopic composition that is within \n\nthe range of compositions shown by samples derived from the activity of the \n\nCanaries mantle plume, suggesting that the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the \n\nWIM probably resulted from the activity of the same plume. Magmas derived from \n\nthis mantle plume also show FOZO like Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic signatures. \n\nHowever, He and Os isotopic data for samples from the Canary islands point a \n\nmodel involving the dilution of a HIMU plume component in the a DMM \n\n(asthenospheric?) component.  \n\n \n\u2022 Primitive mantle normalized multielemental diagrams confirm the trace \n\nelement enriched character of these rocks and show some features that are common \n\nto all the studied samples, such as positive Nb and Ta anomalies. \n\n \n\u2022 These diagrams also allowed for the identification of distinct features in \n\nthe trace element patterns of the two pulses of Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic \n\nactivity. Basic samples from the second pulse show negative K, Zr, Hf and \n\nsometimes Ti anomalies, which are absent in unfractionated basic samples of the \n\nfirst pulse. \n\n \n\u2022 These negative anomalies are thought to reflect the action of a \n\nmetasomatic event which modified the original mantle mineralogy and chemical \n\ncomposition. \n\n \n\u2022 The negative K anomalies are attributed to the presence of residual \n\namphibole during melting, which buffered K concentrations in the resulting \n\nmagmas. Amphibole is only stable at temperature conditions correspondent to the \n\n\n\n \n\n327 \n \n\nlithospheric mantle and therefore should reflect the action of volatile rich \n\nmetasomatic fluids in the lithosphere or the equilibration of magmas with \n\nmetasomatized lithospheric mantle domains. \n\n \n\u2022 Negative anomalies in Zr, Hf and Ti are thought to reflect the action of \n\ncarbonatitic or CO2 rich melts that metasomatized the mantle before the melting \n\nevent that generated the magmas of the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\u2022 The composition of the metasomatic agent is likely to be gradational, \n\nfrom a carbonatitic to a volatile rich siliceous melt. However, the high Zr/Hf and \n\nlow Ti/Eu at high La/Yb point towards an important carbonatitic contribution. \n\n \n\u2022 The source for such a metasomatic agent might have been low degree \n\nmelts from a carbonated peridotite in an ascending mantle plume, such as the \n\nCanaries mantle plume. These early melts imprinted the plume signature in the \n\nlithosphere and lowered its fusion temperature. This is supported by the similar \n\nisotopic signatures observed in both pulses, which allowed for the assignment of a \n\ncommon origin for the sublithospheric and for the metasomatic components. \n\n \n\u2022 The contribution of metasomatized mantle to the total volume of \n\nproduced melt decreases with increasing degrees of melting, as the rocks that derive \n\nfrom higher amounts of fusion show lower Zr/Hf, La/Yb and higher Ti/Eu. This \n\nmeans that the melts from the metasomatized source were progressively diluted in \n\nasthenospheric plume related melts. \n\n \n\u2022 Since this metasomatic signature is only detected in rocks from the \n\nsecond pulse, it is likely that the metasomatic event is contemporary of the first \n\npulse of magmatic alkaline activity (94-88 Ma) or that it occurred just before the \n\nformation of the magmas from the second pulse. \n\n \n\u2022 Most of the studied samples represent somewhat fractionated magmas \n\nsince they do not fit the criteria to classify as unfractionated primary magmas. This \n\nis an indicator for the existence of important fractionation at depth. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n328 \n \n\n\u2022 The magmatic evolution of the samples from the LVC appears to have \n\nbeen controlled by assimilation and fractional crystallization (AFC) processes. The \n\nfractionating assemblage which better reproduces the evolution trend seen in these \n\nrocks is constituted by clinopyroxene (55%) + olivine (20%) + plagioclase (17.5%) \n\n+ magnetite (7.5%). \n\n \n\u2022 Assimilation of upper crustal lithologies is thought to have occurred \n\nconcurrently with crystal fractionation in order to create the observed trace element \n\nand isotopic signatures. Two main AFC trends are observed, one characterized by \n\nthe progressive increase in Th/La, Zr/Nb, K/Nb, 87Sr/86Sr and 207Pb/204Pb, and \n\ndecrease in (Gd/Lu)N, Nb/U, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb with \n\nincreasing SiO2. This trend seems to be common to most of the contaminated and \n\nevolved samples and is thought to reflect assimilation of an upper crustal, siliceous, \n\nrock. \n\n \n\u2022 The other AFC trend is characterized by increasing 87Sr/86Sr and \n\nrelatively unchanged trace element as well as ?Ndi and Pb isotopic ratios in the \n\ncontaminated rocks, which also possess relatively low SiO2 contents. This trend is \n\nthought to be the result of the assimilation of small amounts of Sr rich but Nd and \n\nPb depleted contaminant, such as carbonate material. \n\n \n\u2022 The gabbros of the Sintra and Sines igneous complexes show apparently \n\ncontaminated Pb isotopic signatures along with uncontaminated Sr and Nd isotopic \n\nratios. Such a signature is likely to be the result of secondary hydrothermal \n\nalteration by Pb rich fluids. \n\n \n\u2022 Mineral chemistry data supports the existence of magma mixing at depth \n\nfor some of the magmas of the second pulse of the Late Cretaceous alkaline activity. \n\nHowever, geochemical modeling seems to show that this process is of little \n\nimportance in creating the petrological diversity observed in these rocks, with \n\nfractional crystallization and assimilation appearing to be the most important \n\nprocesses. \n\n \n\u2022 The mixing and homogenization of a basic, primitive magma with small \n\nportions of a more evolved, volatile rich liquid probably led to the formation of a \n\n\n\n \n\n329 \n \n\nmelt that retained its basic nature but suffered a reduction in density and an increase \n\nin the volatile content. This resulted in the pressurization of the system, leading to \n\nrapid ascension and installation of the magmas.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 As the volatile rich magma approached the surface, the volatiles would \n\nstart to exsolve due to decompression, generating explosive eruptions such as the \n\nones that happened before every effusive phase in the LVC. \n\n \n \n\nWider geodynamical implications: \n\n \n\u2022 The timing and location, and even certain geochemical characteristics of \n\nthe Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism in the WIM seems to be associated with \n\nlocal structure and changes in the kinematics of the Iberian plate.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 The absence of a metasomatic signature materialized by negative \n\nnegative K, Zr and Hf anomalies during the first pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\nactivity in the onshore WIM (94-88 Ma) could be related to a more favorable stress \n\nfield during the contemporaneous rotation of Iberia which permitted the quick \n\nascent of the magmas generated in an ascending plume.  \n\n \n\u2022 During the second pulse (75-72 Ma) some of the samples show a \n\nmetasomatic signature characterized by negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies. The \n\npresence of such a signature is associated with the contemporaneous onset of the \n\nrapid collision between the African and Iberian plates and the initiation of inversion \n\nin the Mesozoic basins which created an unfavorable stress regime, and restraining \n\nthe opening of fractures and quick magmatic ascent. This favored interaction with \n\nsubcontinental lithosphere and either resulted in the metasomatism and fusion of its \n\nlowermost part, or allowed for the melting and incorporation of lithosphere \n\nmetasomatized during the first pulse.  \n\n \n\u2022 The lack of an age progression for the Late Cretaceous alkaline \n\nmagmatism of the onshore and offshore WIM suggests that this magmatism is not \n\nsimply controlled by the translation of Iberia over an individual hot spot. Instead, \n\nthis fact suggests that the magmatism and its emplacement is associated with various \n\n\n\n \n\n330 \n \n\nfactors, such as the changes in Iberian plate kinematics, pre-existing Variscan and \n\nMesozoic rifting faults of and the large size of the hot mantle anomaly. The \n\noccurrence of the MTR seamounts (103 to 80 Ma) along the ocean-continent \n\ntransitional domain suggests this acted as a northerly trending major deep rooted \n\nshear zone probably active during the rotation of Iberia. \n\n \n\n\u2022 From 80 Ma to the end of the Cretaceous, the offshore magmatism in the \n\nWIM seems to be limited to the Ormonde peak of the Gorringe bank (? 65 Ma) \n\nalthough the NW Tore seamount shows a 80.5 Ma age. On the other hand, this was \n\nthe time when magmatism was most abundant in the onshore WIM, which might \n\nreflect the drift of continental Iberia over an anomalous, hotter area of the mantle.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 The smaller volume magma produced in the onshore, when compared \n\nwith the offshore is probably associated with the higher thickness of the lithosphere \n\nin this region, which reduced the quantity of produced magma and/or \n\naccommodated the intrusions at various levels of discontiniuties. \n\n \n\n\u2022 During their ascension, magmas appear to have taken advantage of a \n\nseries of pre-existing structures, related with the Variscan orogeny and/or with \n\nMesozoic rifting.  \n\n \n\u2022 The emplacement of the magmatic bodies in upper crustal levels, \n\noccurred at the intersection of the WNW-ESE to E-W rift transfer faults with NE-\n\nSW and NNW-SSE fault systems, both of which consist of reactivations of \n\nPaleozoic fauls. Some of these WNW-ESE to E-W, which are sub-parallel to the \n\noceanic transform faults, appear to be major lithospheric discontinuities that \n\ncontrolled the magma emplacement and transport along large areas, such as the \n\nTore-Sintra fault in the Estremadura spur. \n\n \n\n\u2022 As a corollary, it is concluded that the timing, location and certain \n\ngeochemical characteristics of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism in the WIM \n\nare associated with the regional crustal/lithospheric structure and changes in the \n\nkinematics of the Iberian plate and its overall motion over the Canary hot spot. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n331 \n \n\n10. Suggestions for future work \n \n\n\u2022 Collection of further geochronological data on the LVC, many of the \n\nsmall volume occurrences it is associated with (sills, plugs and dykes), the Mafra \n\nradial dyke complex, the Cascais dykes, the Fontanelas seamount and some  of the \n\nbasic alkaline occurrences in Algarve basin would allow for a refinement of the \n\ntiming of this magmatism and dispel doubts over the occurrence of an age \n\nprogression or several pulses of activity for this event, as well as provide a better \n\nframe for the relation between the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism of the WIM \n\nand its contemporaneous geodynamic context. \n\n \n\n\u2022 A more complete geochronological dataset would also allow to better \n\nconstrain the timing of the metasomatic processes that took place before the \n\nemplacement and extrusion of certain Late Cretaceous alkaline occurrences. \n\n \n\n\u2022 The characteristics of this metasomatic event could be known in more \n\ndetail if the more basic, uncontaminated lithologies are sampled and studied. To \n\navoid problems with the composition of the rocks being modified by crystal \n\naccumulation, matrix separates should be prepared and analyzed instead of whole \n\nrock samples. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Detailed mapping of the Sines and Sintra complexes and their dyke \n\ncomplexes in order to distinguish different facies among the already identified \n\nlithologies and understand the relation between mafic, intermediate and felsic \n\noutcrops and between these and the dykes they are intruded by. This, accompanied \n\nwith further geochemical and geochronologic data, would lead to improvements in \n\nthe emplacement histories and evolution mechanisms of these complexes. \n\n \n\n\u2022 This detailed mapping would also allow for the in depth study of the \n\ncrystal fractionation and accumulation processes in these complexes through whole \n\nrock and mineral chemistry analyzes, namely if the different types of gabbro really \n\ndo represent different levels of the same magma chamber. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n332 \n \n\n\u2022 Comprehensive sampling and mineral chemistry study of the xenoliths \n\npresent in this province, namely in the Ribeira d\u2019Ilhas plugs and Eiras do Fai\u00e3o sill. \n\nThis would allow a better characterization of the crystallization conditions, \n\nincluding parental melt composition, depth and temperature. It would also provide \n\nnew information on the relation between these xenoliths and the magmas where they \n\nare contained. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Detailed mineral chemistry, including in situ trace elements and isotopic \n\nanalysis made by LA-ICP-MS of the xenocrysts that show reverse zoning and are \n\nevidence for the occurrence of magma mixing at depth. This would result in a better \n\nunderstanding of the crystallization conditions and composition of the parental \n\nmagma of these cores. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Sampling, geochemical and geochronological analyses of the remaining \n\nseamounts between Fontanelas and Tore and of the seamounts NW of Tore between \n\nthis seamount and the King\u2019s Trough. This would allow the characterization of these \n\nrocks and determine whether they are associated with the same Late Cretaceous \n\nAlkaline episode in the WIM associated with the Canaries plume, or if they are \n\nrelated to any other context. \n\n \n\n\u2022 The collection of paleomagnetic data on the dated rocks would also \n\nimprove the paleogeographic reconstitutions of Iberia during the Late Cretaceous \n\nand allow for a better assessment of geodynamic context contemporaneous of the \n\nstudied magmatic episode. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n333 \n \n\n11.
