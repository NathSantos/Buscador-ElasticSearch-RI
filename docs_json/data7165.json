For the whole\ncatchment area and for the 30 m buffer strips of the streams of 22 randomly selected catchments, the\npredominant land use and habitat quality were studied. Owing mainly to the high soil erodibility, the\nriver basin is highly susceptible to erosive processes. Habitat quality analyses revealed that the\nsuperficial water from the catchments is not chemically impacted but suffers physical damage. A high\nchemical purity is observed since there are no urban areas along the catchments. The water is physically\npoor because of high rates of sediment delivery and the almost nonexistence of riparian vegetation.\nKey words: erosion modeling, expectation of soil loss map, riparian vegetation, water quality\n\nRISCO DE PERDA DE SOLO E QUALIDADE DO HABITAT NUMA\nBACIA HIDROGR\u00c1FICA DE MESO-ESCALA\n\nRESUMO: Expectativa de perda de solo e poss\u00edveis rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre eros\u00e3o, vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o rip\u00e1ria e qualidade\nda \u00e1gua foram estudados na bacia do rio S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Dourados (SP).

This re-\nlationship has been investigated worldwide (Silva &amp;\nWilliams, 2001; Allan, 2004), and in Brazil some stud-\nies have been carried out to better understand such re-\nlations (Alvares &amp; Silva, 2005; Barrella &amp; Petrere,\n2003; Casatti et al., 2006).\n\nOwing to important and interesting components\nthat are favorable to some human activities (Fischer et\n\nal., 2000; Allan, 2004) riparian vegetation has been con-\nstantly and directly affected by deforestation worldwide.\nJobin et al. (2004) point out that in North America over\n90% of riparian habitats have been lost over the last 200\nyears, mostly due to intensive agriculture, which has\nalso contributed to the degradation of the originally for-\nested landscape. In Brazil, especially in the S\u00e3o Paulo\nState, the level of degradation is similar (Kronka et al.,\n2002), and such degradation has occurred mainly over\nthe last 100 years. Changes in riparian vegetation can\ninfluence channel morphology, rates of erosion and\ndeposition, and by extension, the entire sediment bud-\nget of a reach (Allan, 2004).\n\nv64n4a03.pmd 2/7/2007, 10:26336\n\n\n\nSoil loss risk and habitat quality 337\n\nSci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.64, n.4, p.336-343, July/August 2007\n\nFor this purpose, modern technology has pro-\nvided effective analytical tools such as remote sens-\ning and satellite imaging, GIS, and expert systems to\nfacilitate studies of environmental impacts. Addition-\nally, habitat and water quality are also evaluated using\nindividual variables or combined metrics (Casatti et al.,\n2006). Thus, a wide variety of assessment methods\nis available to evaluate the response of stream condi-\ntions to a gradient in land use (Allan, 2004). Although\nthese studies have become more common over the past\n20 years, they leave many questions unanswered. For\ninstance, there is still an ongoing dispute as to whether\nthe land use of the entire catchment or that of the ri-\nparian zone is more important in influencing the wa-\nter quality, all other factors remaining constant (Sliva\n&amp; Williams, 2001).\n\nIn this study we estimated the expectation of\nsoil loss and also analyzed possible relationships that\nthe erosive process has with the habitat quality in the\nriver network of the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Dourados river ba-\nsin (SJD).\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nStudy area\nThe study area is a meso-scale river basin\n\nsituated in the Northwest of S\u00e3o Paulo State (South-\neastern Brazil), between latitudes 20o15\u201936\" and\n20o51\u201932\" and longitudes 49o31\u201930\" and 51o21\u201932\"\n(Figure 1). It is a 6th order basin (Strahler, 1957) and\nencompasses a drainage area of 5,158.9 km2. It com-\nprises a delimited area for water resources and is lo-\ncated in the Serra Geral formation, with basalt and\nsedimentary rocks of the Caiu\u00e1 and Bauru groups\n(IPT, 2000).\n\nThe climate is of the hot tropical type (Nimer,\n1989), with maximum mean temperatures ranging\nfrom 31 to 32\u00b0C, and minimum mean temperatures of\n13\u00b0 to 14\u00b0C. The average annual rainfall ranges from\n\n1,300 to 1,800 mm. The predominant original vegeta-\ntion is \u201cSemi Deciduous Seasonal Forest\u201d, but patches\nof Savanna (\u201cCerrado\u201d) also occur in the area.\n\nThe SJD river basin is an important agricul-\ntural region, presenting one of the highest livestock\npopulations for milk and meat production in Brazil\n(named mix production \u2013 CATI, 2006). Thus, pasture\nis the main land-cover class that occurs in the region\n(Casatti et al., 2006). The soil and water resources\nhave been severely degraded due to diverse causes: soil\nerosion (consequence of soil/soil-cover mismanage-\nment), increasing urban populations and related water\npollution problems, among others (Casatti et al., 2006;\nIPT, 2000).\n\nUSLE application\nThe soil loss expectation data were surveyed\n\nusing the Universal Soil Loss Equation (Wischmeier &amp;\nSmith, 1978): A = R . K . L . S . C . P; where: A is\nthe rate of soil loss (t ha-1 y-1), R is a factor for an-\nnual rainfall erosivity (MJ mm ha-1 h-1  y-1), K is a fac-\ntor for soil erodibility (t ha h ha-1 MJ-1 mm-1), L, S, C\nand P are dimensionless factors for slope length, slope\nsteepness, cover management, and supporting prac-\ntices, respectively. The information concerning to the\nsix parameters of the USLE were computed using\nGIS technology (Idrisi 3.2 (Eastman, 2001)), as ex-\nplained below.\n\nR factor \u2013 this layer was elaborated using the\ndatabase and the digital map of the rainfall erosivity,\nextracted from the database elaborated and cited by\nSilva (2004). K factor \u2013 this one was generated by us-\ning the S\u00e3o Paulo State pedological map (1:500,000)\nand assigned values according to soil class as studied\nby Silva &amp; Alvares (2005). LS factor - a 30-meter\nresolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study\narea was used. By using the DEM and the USLE-2D\nfreeware (Desmet &amp; Govers, 1996), the LS factor was\ngenerated, where the value of each cell corresponds\nto the LS factor. C and P factor - were generated (C\nand P jointly) using a digital land cover map, originally\ndivided into ten land cover categories. This map was\nelaborated using a Landsat 5 (TM) image dated from\nJuly \u2013 1996 and the supervised classification method\n(Lillesand &amp; Kiefer, 2000). The C and P values were\nassigned according to the land cover category obtained\nfrom Bertoni &amp; Lombardi Neto (1990); Mitchell &amp;\nBubenzer (1980) and Silva (1999).\n\nOnce all existing information about each USLE\nfactors and their respective layers was gathered, the\nsoil loss expectation was calculated by the multiplica-\ntion of the layers (Silva et al., 2003). The results were\nreclassified into five interpretation classes (Silva et al.,\n2003).Figure 1 - Location of the study area within the S\u00e3o Paulo State.\n\nv64n4a03.pmd 2/7/2007, 10:26337\n\n\n\nSilva et al.338\n\nSci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.64, n.4, p.336-343, July/August 2007\n\nRiparian buffer zone determination\nFollowing Narumalani et al. (1997), the map\n\ncontaining the buffer zone of the river network of the\nstudy area was elaborated using the land cover and\ndigital river network map. Subsequently, the dimension\nof the buffer zone (30 meters) was decided accord-\ning to the values determined by the Brazilian Forest\nCode (Brasil, 1965). Hence, the buffer zones were ex-\ntracted using the river network, and the \u201cBuffer\u201d rou-\ntine of the Idrisi 3.2 software (Eastman, 2001). The\nmaps containing the buffer zones and the land cover\nwere overlayed (\u201cOverlay\u201d routine of the Idrisi, with\nthe multiplication option), to generate a new map con-\ntaining the land cover for the buffer zones only. Fi-\nnally, the areas of each land cover class were calcu-\nlated (\u201cArea\u201d routine of the Idrisi).\n\nWater and habitat quality analyses\nThe water quality was determined for twenty\n\ntwo randomly chosen sampling points (Figure 2), six-\nteen located in first-order rivers, classified in accor-\ndance to the Strahler system of hydrographic hierar-\nchy (Strahler, 1957), three points in second-order riv-\ners and three in third-order rivers. To minimize the in-\nfluence of the seasonal variability, field work was car-\nried out during the beginning of the dry season (March\nto June, 2003). A 75 m stretch was chosen at each\nside of the stream with the aim of including all avail-\nable macro-habitats (Casatti et al., 2006).\n\nWater quality assessment included the devel-\nopment of physical and chemical water indexes\n(PCWI) and the physical habitat index (HI). For the\ncomposition of the PCWI at each sampling point the\nparameters dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, turbid-\nity (all measured \u201cin situ\u201d through digital meter Horiba\u00ae,\n\nmodel U-10), orthophosphate, nitrate, and ammonia (all\nanalyzed in a specialized laboratory) were measured.\nIn addition, water odors were recorded and water sur-\nface oils were also visually documented as indicators\nof possible human disturbance of a stream reach\n(Barbour et al., 1999). All parameters were compared\nagainst conditions observed in the totally protected\nwater courses in the Morro do Diabo State Park (Silva,\n2005), where the Atlantic Forest covers the entire wa-\ntersheds. A metric raw score was developed based on\nthe deviation from the reference condition and the av-\nerage final score for each site was separated into four\ncategories (good, fair, poor, and very poor). The com-\nplete procedures of sampling can be found in Casatti\net al. (2006).\n\nFollowing Roth et al. (1996), nine metrics\nwere used to compose the Habitat Index (HI), which\nare: substrate stability, velocity and depth variability,\nflow stability, bottom deposition, combinations of pool-\nriffle-run, channel alteration, streamside cover, bank\nvegetative stability, and bank stability. Complete and\ndetailed explanation of the PCWI and HI is available\nin Casatti et al. (2006).\n\nAll the sampling points were geo-referenced\nand plotted over the Digital Elevation Model of the\nstudy area using the Idrisi program. The respective\ncatchment areas of each sampling point were on-screen\nand manually digitalized. The layer of drainage area of\neach of the sampling point was intersected with the\nSLE, land-cover and buffer maps. Using these maps,\nthe catchment area, the percentage of occurrence of\neach class of the SLE map, of each land cover cat-\negory (total catchment area) and of the predominant\nland cover category - specifically for the 30 m ripar-\n\nFigure 2 - Water quality sampling points and their respective catchments.\n\nv64n4a03.pmd 2/7/2007, 10:26338\n\n\n\nSoil loss risk and habitat quality 339\n\nSci.

The soil map and erod-\nibility values for the region show that the soils of the\nriver basin are highly erodible in approximately 94%\nof the area. The soil class \u201cAcrisol\u201d occurs over\n93.1% of the whole area and this class has the great-\nest erodibility, classified as \u201cvery high erodibility\u201d\nmainly due the abrupt textural change and the high\nsand percentage (Oliveira et al., 1999; Silva &amp;\nAlvares, 2005).\n\nThe LS factor map was reclassified into six\nclasses, according to LS values: \u201c<1\u201d (occurring in\n21.4% of the study area), \u201c=1\u201d (0%). The classes \u201c3\u201d,\n\u201c4\u201d, \u201c5\u201d, and \u201c6\u201d, wich correspond, respectively, to\nintervals of \u201c1.1-10.0\u201d, \u201c10.1-50.0\u201d, \u201c50.1-100.0\u201d and\n\u201c>100.1\u201d, occurred in 0.4%, 30.2%, 35.3% and\n12.6%, respectively. The LS factor closely reflected\nthe overall topographic pattern of the region (predomi-\nnance of flat to slowly undulating relief).\n\nThe land cover map of the basin (Figure 3) in-\ndicates pasture as the predominant land-cover class,\noccurring in 78.1%. For this land-cover class the val-\nues 0.1607 and 0.7000 were attributed to C and P\nUSLE factors, respectively. The remnant vegetation\nclass occurs in 6.9% of the study area and the C and\nP values most appropriate for this class are 0.0024 and\n1.000, respectively, (Bertoni &amp; Lombardi Neto, 1990;\nMitchell &amp; Bubenzer, 1980; Silva, 1999).\n\nThe category \u201curban places\u201d occurs in 0.6%\nof the river basin. The C factor was 0.1242 (Silva,\n1999). Normally the value P = 1 is attributed to this\nland cover category (Silva et al., 2003). In some cases,\nhowever, there are some activities developed within the\nurban area that can reduce erosion and land degrada-\ntion. Consequently, considering this possibility, the P\nvalue adopted for \u201curban places\u201d was 0.95. Refores-\ntation is a land-cover category occurring in a very\nsmall percentage within the study area (0.02%). The\nC value was 0.0470 and the P value was 1.000. The\nattribution of P = 1 is because in Brazil usually no soil\nconservation practices are used in reforestation activi-\nties (Kronka et al., 2002). Thus, the combined C.P\nvalue is 0.047.\n\nThe class \u201cperennial cultures\u201d occurs in 3.2%\nof the area, and is composed mainly of orange or-\nchards and rubber tree plantations, although a few\ncoffee plantations also occur. The values attributed\nwere: C = 0.2190 and P = 0.40 (combined C.P =\n0.088). The class \u201cannual crops\u201d occurs in 0.20%\nof the study area and is represented by the corn and\nsoybean fields. For this class the C and P values\nwere, respectively, 0.1720 and 0.5000 (C.P = 0.086)\n(Bertoni &amp; Lombardi Neto, 1990; Mitchell &amp;\nBubenzer, 1980; Silva, 1999).\n\n\"Sugar cane\" and \"bare soil\", two closely re-\nlated land covers, occur in 2.1% and 6.9%, respec-\ntively, of the SJD river basin. For sugar cane the at-\ntributed C and P values were, respectively, 0.1743 and\n0.7000, while for bare soil the attributed values were,\nrespectively, 1.000 (soil totally uncovered) and 0.70\n(Mitchell &amp; Bubenzer, 1980). The combined C and P\nvalues were 0.122 and 0.700, respectively, for sugar\ncane and bare soil. The class \"water bodies\" occurs\nin 1.82% of the area and has negligible significance\n\nFigure 3 - Land cover map for SJD river basin.\n\nv64n4a03.pmd 2/7/2007, 10:26339\n\n\n\nSilva et al.340\n\nSci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.64, n.4, p.336-343, July/August 2007\n\nfor soil loss, while the class \u201cothers\u201d - that occurs in\n0.2%, was attributed by convention, the values 0.14\nand 1.00, for C and P factors, respectively (Silva et\nal., 2003).\n\nThe result of the combination of the USLE fac-\ntors revealed that there is a predominance of the class\nthat indicates \u201cvery high\u201d soil loss expectation (that\nmeans a soil loss expectation higher than 200 t ha-1\n\nyear-1). This class occurs in 73.4% of the area. The\nclass \u201cnull\u201d (0 - 10 t ha-1 year-1) is the second pre-\ndominant class and occurs in 15.3%, followed by class\n\u201cmedium\u201d (15 \u2013 50 t ha-1 year-1) with 7.3%, \u201cmedium\nto high\u201d (50 - 120 t ha-1 year-1) with 2.9%, \u201chigh\u201d (120\n- 200 t ha-1 year-1) with 0.8% and \u201cmoderate\u201d (10 -\n15 t ha-1 year-1) with 0.3%. Through the routine \u201cre-\ngress\u201d of the Idrisi, it was possible to verify that the\nUSLE factor that presented the closest relation with\nSLE was the CP (r2 = 0.491).\n\nWater and habitat quality analyzes\nTable 1 summarizes the percentage occurrence\n\nof each soil loss expectation, the percentage of rem-\nnant riparian vegetation for a 30m buffer strip, the num-\nber of headwaters, the main land-use in the catchments\nand in the respective 30m buffer strip, and the classifi-\ncation of physical, chemical and habitat quality indexes.\n\nAs occurred in the whole river basin, pasture\nwas the predominant land cover class for the 22 in-\nvestigated catchments, with occurrences higher than\n75%. Similarly, pasture was the main land cover class\nthat occurred for the 30m buffer for most catchments,\nthe only exception being catchment number eighteen,\nwhere for the buffer zone the predominant land cover\nclass was remnant natural vegetation.\n\nThe results of physico-chemical and habitat\nquality analyses indicate that the streams are only slightly\naffected chemically, because eighteen catchments pre-\nsented a physico-chemical condition classified as \u201cgood\u201d\nand four classified as \u201cfair\u201d. On the other hand, the habi-\ntat characteristics are strongly affected, because one\ncatchment had a physical quality classified as \u201cvery\npoor\u201d, sixteen were considered \u201cpoor\u201d, five \u201cfair\u201d and\nnot a single one was considered as \u201cgood\u201d. The per-\ncentage of riparian remnant forest along the 30m buffer\nstrip varied from 0 to 50.8% and eight of them did not\npresent any riparian vegetation cover.\n\nThe soil loss expectation class \u201c> 200 t ha-1 y-1\u201d\npresented predominant occurrence in all twenty-two\ncatchments, the occurrence varying from 59.8 to\n90.4%. The hierarchical order of the stream did not\nimpede the degradation of the habitat quality and the\nlevel of degradation can be ratified by the soil expec-\ntation loss, which for all watersheds was predomi-\nnantly \u201c> 200\u201d.\n\nRegarding the erosive process, the western re-\ngion of the state presents elevated susceptibility to ero-\nsion because of the high erodibility of both the soil and\nthe geological basement (IPT, 1997), which results in\nsandy and highly detachable soils. Other river basins\nlocated in such regions (Aguape\u00ed, Peixe, for instance)\nalso present high susceptibility to erosion for the same\nreason (IPT, 1997).\n\nThe resulting database obtained in this study\nconcerning soil loss expectation is in agreement with\nthe erosion map published by IPT (1997) for the en-\ntire S\u00e3o Paulo State, based on geological, pedological\nand geomorphological maps. The high occurrence of\nareas showing high expectation of soil loss was also\nverified by Cerri et al. (2001) for Piracicaba River Ba-\nsin and, according to these authors, the main driving\nforces were the kind of land cover and the absence\nof adequate soil tillage practices.\n\nBecause the studied region may be highly sus-\nceptible to erosive processes, the use of conservation\npractices is crucial, but the scenario is completely dif-\nferent. Through field trips it was verified that the use\nof soil conservation practices is rare, relatively recent,\nand in some regions the cattle density is high, leading\nto overgrazing. Pasture, the main land-cover class re-\nported in this study, is a long term and significant part\nof SJD land use and is a critical component of rural\nlandscape in S\u00e3o Paulo State. The main function of\npasture is as a primary support system for livestock.\nIt can affect conservation and environmental planning\nin several ways, including soil carbon storage, soil\nquality, and water quality. Depending on the way live-\nstock and pasture are managed, the effect of livestock\non such parameters is highly significant (Al-Kaisi &amp;\nHanna, 2004).\n\nThe class \u201curban settlement\u201d did not occur in\nany of the 22 catchments. This is, probably, the pri-\nmary and main reason that explains the good chemi-\ncal quality of the water observed for almost all\ncatchments. Sliva &amp; Williams (2001) mention urban-\nization as the main factor that influences the chemical\nquality of streams in Ontario (Canada), a result also\nsupported by Daniel et al. (2002) for the Piracicaba\nRiver Basin (Brazil).\n\nThe second possible cause that explains the\ngood chemical condition of the stream water is the\nchemical composition of the soil types of the catch-\nment area. Acrisol is the predominant soil unit (Oliveira\net al., 1999) and the Acrisol occurring in S\u00e3o Paulo\nState is mostly sandy, with clays of low activity\n(Bertoni &amp; Lombardi Neto, 1990). This indicates that\nthe amount of chemical components removed from the\nsoil and delivered to the drainage channels is relatively\nlow.\n\nv64n4a03.pmd 2/7/2007, 10:26340\n\n\n\nSoil loss risk and habitat quality 341\n\nSci.

Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.64, n.4, p.336-343, July/August 2007\n\nThe third possible reason is that the farmers\ndo not use fertilizers in pasture management (the main\nspecies used for pasture seems to be Brachiaria\ndecumbens Stapf). Thus, when runoff occurs, there\nis no fertilizer to be transported. On the other hand,\nas this species is tolerant to soils of low fertility and\nis highly adapted to Brazilian climatic conditions, it is\nwidely used (Mattos, 2001). As cattle are normally\nmismanaged and the pasture is typically overgrazed,\nthe soil surface becomes poorly covered and highly\nsusceptible to erosion (Sparovek, 1996).\n\nThe association of livestock with pasture man-\nagement, and the need for livestock to have access to\nwater, also intensifies the problems associated to soil\nstability and water quality (Al-Kaisi &amp; Hanna, 2004).\nThe deterioration of pasture cover due to intensive\ngrazing can be a very significant source of pollution\nfrom both sediment and animal waste. To improve the\nwater quality of the SJD river basin, the producers that\nwork with livestock in pasture should find ways to\nkeep animals out of streams and find alternative wa-\nter sources. Rotational grazing might be a good op-\ntion for managing the quantity and quality of vegeta-\ntion so as to improve water quality, since this kind of\nmanagement system allows soil and vegetation time to\nrecover from grazing and restore good soil conditions\n(Al-Kaisi &amp; Hanna, 2004).\n\nThe majority of the stream reaches (77.2%)\npresent poor or very poor physical habitat conditions\nfor supporting aquatic wildlife communities (especially\nfishes, according to Casatti et al., 2006). Such authors\nobserved, through field visits, that many small first-or-\nder streams listed in the official hydrographic map of\nthe SJD river basin (which is from the 1970s) do not\nexist anymore, being dry and completely silted. This\ncurrent and hazardous situation of high level degrada-\ntion of the water (physical parameters) of the in-stream\nhabitat of the SJD river basin is partially due to the high\nlevel of degradation of the riparian vegetation existing\nin the catchments (Sliva &amp; Williams, 2001; Allan, 2004).\n\nThe study area is in a worse condition than that\nshowed in IPT (1997 and 2000). Therefore, it is sug-\ngested that extremely urgent and planned actions are\nadapted, perhaps beginning the restoring actions of the\ncatchments with 0% riparian vegetation (Table 1).\nThese areas should be the first to receive action and\nresources owing to the present expectation of soil loss.\nThe divulgation of these data to city managers and re-\ngional populations is also extremely important and ur-\ngent to show the seriousness of the situation, to stimu-\nlate the perception of the need for environmental con-\nservation / repair, and also to facilitate a joint and co-\nhesive action to improve the environmental quality of\nthe S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Dourados River Basin.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe predominant land cover (pasture) and\nsoil mismanagement have intensified erosion within\nthe study area. The results revealed the high level\nof environmental degradation that the SJD river ba-\nsin is suffering, with 77.2% of the catchments hav-\ning water of poor or very poor physical character-\nistics for the sustenance of aquatic wildlife. Actions\nfor the restoration of the riparian vegetation (or, at\nleast, a part of it) are extremely important and ur-\ngent to conserve and recuperate water resources\nand wildlife (terrestrial and aquatic) of this river ba-\nsin.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nTo Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado\nde S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP) and Fundunesp, for financial\nsupport and scholarships.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAL-KAISI, M.; HANNA, M.
