However, these procedures \ninvolved the use of surgical thread or foam that acting as foreign \nbodies and promote local inflammatory reaction and hinders the \nhealing process1. Furthermore, the sutures are difficult by the soft \nand friable consistency of spleen parenchyma.\n\nThe treatment of these injuries with biological adhesive \nseems to be advantageous to avoid the use of sutures or foam, \nthe compound is completely absorbed in a few days2 and is not \nassociated to foreign body granuloma3.\n\nThe biological adhesive of fibrin allowed a new approach \nto the bleeding spleen trauma, initially by laparotomy4, and \nrecently by laparoscopic via5. The polymerization of the adhesive is \neffective independently of the integrity of the coagulation cascade \nor the platelets count, and this may be an advantage in patients \nwith coagulopathy diseases or under the effect of anticoagulant \ndrugs6,7.\n\nOur purpose is verifying the effectiveness of fibrin glue, \nused by laparoscopic via, in comparison to the conventional suture \ninto promote the hemostasis of a standard spleen injury on a \nheparinized experimental porcine model.\n\nMethods \n\nThe experimental protocol (#1364/07) was approved \nby the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Sao Paulo \n(UNIFESP), Brazil. The pigs were maintained according to the \nnorms of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals \n(Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, 1996) and to the ethical \nprinciples of the Brazilian Committee on Animal Experimentation \n(COBEA).\n\nEighteen Landrace pigs, males, six months old, weighing \n14 to 19.5kg each were housed in temperature - and light-\ncontrolled environmental conditions with a 12-hour light-dark \ncycle, and given free access to water and standard pellet chow until \n6 hours prior the surgical procedures. All procedures were done in \nthe laboratories of Experimental Surgery, Department of Surgery \n(UNIFESP). The animals were submitted to laparoscopic standard \nspleen injury and randomly distributed in three groups (n=6): \n\nGHA (heparin plus adhesive), GH (heparin without adhesive) and \nGS (Sham - without heparin or adhesive).\n\nAfter six hours fasting for solid diet and four hours for \nliquid diet, the animals received intramuscularly 0.2mg/kg of \nacepromazin and 0.75mg/kg of midazolan. Ten minutes later, \nthey received 10mg/kg intravenously of sodium thiopental. The \nanesthesia was maintained by endotracheal probe (Rush 7) with \noxygen and 1% halothane. Ringer lactate was administrated \nintravenously at rate of 500ml/hour.\n\n A left cervical incision allowed inserting a 6F catheter in \nthe left carotid artery for measures of mean arterial pressure (MAP) \nand heart rate (HR) using Phillips Viridia 4C device (Phillips \nHealthcare). A Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifesciences LLC \n- Irvine, CA USA), was inserted in the internal jugular vein \nand guided to the pulmonary artery for monitoring the body \ntemperature (T), the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and cardiac \noutput (CD). Vascular blood samples were collected to determine \nthe activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).\n\nTen minutes before the beginning of the surgical \nprocedures a single dose (200UI/kg) of heparin sodium, was \nintravenously administrated in the animals of groups GHA and \nGH. The animals of GS were not heparinized.\n\nUnder aseptic conditions the laparoscopic standard \nprocedure was performed in the animals of all groups. A \nVeress needle was inserted in the umbilical region and the \npneumoperitoneum was setting up a pressure of 12 mm Hg. The \nneedle was withdrawn and inserted into this place a 10mm trocar \nand the 30\u00b0 optical set. \n\nSix centimeters from the abdominal middle line and three \ncentimeters below the left costal margin a second trocar (10mm) \nwas inserted and used to make way for the mechanical device \nspecially designed (Figure 1) to produce a standardized circular \ninjury half centimeter in diameter and one and half centimeter \ndeep in the spleen parenchyma. It consisted of a core of round \nsurgical steel with pointed end that was triggered by an internal \nspring. To arm the device was pulled to the upper end of inner rod \nuntil the point of locking. The release of the trigger attached to the \nouter end was enough to push the steel blade with standard power \ntoward and then producing the spleen injury.\n\nFIGURE 1 - Device used to promote the spleen injury. Steel blade end \npoint (yellow arrow). Trigger (red arrow).

The use of fibrin glue in a heparinized porcine model\n\nA third trocar (5mm) was introduced ten centimeters from \nthe left of the midline and ten centimeters below the left costal \nmargin by which introduces a forceps (grasper). The purpose of \nthis clamp was to improve the visualization of the spleen in order \nto perform the spleen injury. \n\nOnly in the animals of GHA a fourth trocar (5mm) was \ninserted three centimeter from the middle line and five centimeters \nbelow the left costal margin to allowed the passage of double-\nlumen cannula in which were attached two syringes (Figure 2). \nThe syringe A (0.5mL) contained a mixture of fibrinogen, aprotinin \nand factor XIII, and syringe B (0.5mL) a mixture of thrombin \nand calcium chloride. The biological adhesive was composed of \nfibrinogen (65-115mg/mL), factor XIII (40-80 U/mL), aprotinin \n(1000 UIC/mL), thrombin (400-600 IU/mL) and calcium chloride \n(5.88mg/0.5mL). It was preserved at 4 degrees centigrade, being \nbrought to room temperature for 30 minutes before its application \nin spleen injury. Fibrin glue was applied immediately after \nthe mechanical injury and recorded the time elapsed until the \npolymerization and clot formation. \n\nFIGURE 2 - The double-lumen cannula in which was attached two \nsyringes with the two components of fibrin glue.\n\nThe time of the procedure was recorded from the \nintroduction of the first trocar until the end of laparotomy \nprocedure.\n\nThe animals were monitoring during 20 minutes \nimmediately after the spleen injury (T0), ten minutes (T10) and 20 \nminutes (T20) after the injury. It were recording the mean arterial \npressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), body temperature (T), pulmonary \nartery pressure (PAP) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(APTT).\n\nAfter T20 was performed medium laparotomy in animals \nof all groups. To estimate the blood loss during the period of \ntwenty minutes of observation, the amount of blood collected in \nthe abdominal cavity was carefully drained with dry gauze. For \neach gram of the weight (difference between dry and wet weight \nof the gauze) was considered as the loss of a milliliter of blood.\n\nThe gross aspects of spleen injury and the fibrin clot was \nevaluated and photographed. The spleen was collected for further \nmicroscopic study.\n\nThe animals were euthanized by the administration of \n10mL of potassium chloride intravenously. \n\nFor light microscopy samples involving the injury and \nperipheral area were fixed in 10% formalin, immersed in paraffin, \nand stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Histological evaluations \nwere performed with light microscope (Axiolab Standard 2.0, Carl \nZeiss) in magnification of 10X, 100X and 200X.\n\nFor data analysis, it was used the statistical software \nSPSS version 15.0 for Windows. The p<0.05 or 5% was \nconsidered statistically significant. The descriptive analysis \nof continuous variables was described by mean and standard \ndeviation. Categorical variables were described in a contingency \ntable containing the frequency and percentage of occurrences in \neach group and time. For the inferential analysis were applied the \nfollowing nonparametric statistical tests: Kruskal-Wallis test to \nverify the hypothesis of equality between the three groups; Mann-\nWhitney, to check the equality of groups 2 to 2, when applied, \nusing the Kruskal-Wallis test, it appears that the 3 groups were not \nequal; Friedman test, when it wanted to verify the hypothesis that \nthe results of each animal did not change at any time (3 or more \nrepeated measures); Wilcoxon test to verify the equal time 2 to 2, \nwhen applied, using the Friedman test, it appears that the 3 times \nwere not all alike;  Fisher\u2019s generalized test: suitable for frequency \ntables, with which it tested the hypothesis that the observed \nfrequencies in the categories were distributed evenly between the \ngroups.\n\ncatheter                                    syringes\n\n\n\n238 - Acta Cir\u00fargica Brasileira - Vol. 26 (3) 2011\n\nFreire DF et al.\n\nResults\n\nOur data were exposed in the following tables and figures.\n\nTABLE 1 - The means and standard deviation of weight \n(kg), elapsed time of surgical procedures (minutes) and blood loss \n(mL) in the animals of GHA (heparin plus adhesive), GH (heparin \nonly) and GS (without heparin or adhesive).

The surgical adhesive fibrin proved to a \nviable option for making the operative time less and serves as an \nalternative to suture or foam materials10. \n\nAiming to test the effects of the association of adhesive \napplication through laparoscopy approach in an animal under \nthe action of anticoagulant drug we use a model in medium-size \nanimal like the pig. The morphology aspect of the porcine spleen \nis similar to the human being as a reliable model. The sample was \nhomogenous since all animals were male and had body weight \nequivalent (Table 1).\n\nAmong the surgical adhesive available fibrin glue was \nchosen because it does not produce exothermic reaction during the \npolymerization process, be reabsorbed by the organism without \nforeign body granulomas formation and stimulates the healing \nprocess.\n\nFibrin glue is results from the action of thrombin on \nfibrinogen, a reproduction of the last stage of blood coagulation. \nThe reaction is mediated by calcium, and initially forms a soluble \nand unstable fibrin monomer. With the addition of coagulation \nfactor XIII and aprotinin (a protease bovine inhibitor) it became \na insoluble and stable polymer11. The clot formed quickly, about \n1 to 4 seconds and adheres firmly to the point of injury by cross-\nlinking of fibrin with collagen, serum glycoprotein and plasmatic \ncells3. In 10 minutes the clot gets 70% of its strength tensile3. Our \nresults showed that the fibrin clot had a stable aspect from 3 a \n5 seconds. The photomicrography showed the presence of clot \nwithin the lesion in four animals and was only on the surface in \ntwo other animals, without directly influence the amount of blood \ncollected (Figure 4).\n\nThe two components of the adhesive are mixed at room \ntemperature and inserted through the double lumen cannula. Thus, \nfor the animals of GHA the elapsed time was slightly longer, but \nnot significantly from to other two groups (Table 1). \n\nNo significantly body temperature was recorded \n(Table 2), except a mild decrease on T20 in the GHA, although \nno attempt was made to keep the temperature of the animals at \n37\u00b0C. It is well known that the blood clot formation is delayed \nwhen the temperature is below 37\u00b0C12, as result of inhibition \nof enzymatic reactions of the coagulation cascade induced by \n\nhypothermia13. The body temperatures in all groups were lower of \n37\u00b0C, probably due to anesthesia procedures and surgical trauma. \nDespite the initial temperature be less than 37\u00b0C there was no \nsignificant difference throughout the period of observation (T0, \nT10 and T20). We consider that mild hypothermia (GHA /T20) as \nfavorable to our model, since there is report that APTT is increased \nin these situations14. Thus, in addition to the bleeding disorder due \nto heparin also had hypothermia acting as facilitating factor in \nthe bleeding of spleen injury. Despite hypothermia, fibrin clotted \nquickly and was effective in producing stop the bleeding.\n\nThe device especially designs for promote a standard \ntrauma caused a minor injury in the spleen parenchyma with a \nmild blood loss. The blood loss estimated in the animals of GH \nwas three times higher than that of animals which was treated \nwith fibrin and two times higher than the control group who did \nnot use the heparin (Table 1). A blood loss, perhaps by short-term \nobservation, was not enough to cause significant hemodynamic \ndisorders. The cardiac rate, means arterial pressure, pulmonary \nartery pressure showed no significantly differences in either \nheeding three times (T0, T10 and T20) in each group or even in \ngroups with each other (Tables 3, 5 and 6). The cardiac output \n(Table 4) had a slight decrease at T10 and T20 in relation to the \ninitial time (T0) in groups with heparin and the control group. In \nanimals that received the fibrin the blood loss was lower and, as \nexpected, there was no change in the cardiac output.\n\nThe effectiveness of heparin was confirmed by the \ndetermination of APTT which is commonly used for their \nsensitivity and accuracy (Figure 3). In this study it was found that \nthe dose of heparin used (200 U/kg) was sufficient to produce an \nanticoagulant effect in animals of Groups HA and H.\n\nMoreover, the model has some limitations that should be \nexplored in further research. The degree of splenic injury should \nbe applied to produce more severe injuries; the patch should \nbe applied more deeply in the wound; hypothermia should be \ninvestigated to determine their actual influence on the results; more \nsevere injuries may cause more severe hemodynamic changes that \nmay influence the clotting ability of the adhesive.\n\nThis research opens the possibility of using fibrin glue \nas an option for conservative treatment of minor splenic injuries \nin patient with coagulopathy or under the effect of anticoagulant \ndrugs, avoiding the conventional surgical approach of open \nlaparotomy and the use of sutures or sponges.\n\n\n\nActa Cir\u00fargica Brasileira - Vol. 26 (3) 2011 - 241\n\nThe laparoscopy splenic injury repair.
