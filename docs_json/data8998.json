Very small pore size of zeolites (~1 nm) imposes \n\ndiffusional limitations for many catalytic reactions.  The catalytic performance of metal \n\nzeolite bifunctional catalysts can be improved by creating hierarchical zeolites and by \n\ncontrolling localization of metal species within the zeolite crystals. Impregnation is an \n\nefficient method for the preparation of bi-functional cobalt-zeolite catalysts for the \n\ndirect production of liquid fuels from syngas. In the catalysts prepared via \n\nimpregnation, cobalt occupies the cation exchange positions in the zeolite micropores \n\ndecreasing the number of acid sites available for hydrocarbon isomerization and \n\ncracking. Isolation of cobalt ions in cationic positions reduces catalyst reducibility, \n\nmakes it difficult to achieve metallic state and decreases the amount available metal \n\nactive sites for Fischer Tropsch synthesis. We found that the presence of Na\n+\n instead of \n\nH\n+\n ions in the exchange positions of the large pore Beta zeolite favored deposition of \n\ncobalt on the external surface of the zeolite, while the acid sites in the zeolite \n\nmicropores were not much affected.  The large pore cobalt Beta zeolite catalyst with \n\ncobalt species localized on the external surface and high concentration of acid sites in \n\nthe zeolite crystals has showed enhanced catalytic performance in Fischer-Tropsch \n\nsynthesis combined with hydrocarbon isomerization \n\nAnother approach of this thesis has addressed creating hierarchical zeolites with several \n\nlevels of meso- and microporosity using sacrificial templates. Hierarchical zeolites \n\nsynthesized using cobalt containing carbon nanotubes, as sacrificial hard templates \n\nexhibited higher catalytic activity, lower methane selectivity and higher selectivity to \n\nisomerized hydrocarbons in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The synthesis strategy based on \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\nmetal carbon nanotubes as sacrificial templates has been extended to other metals such \n\nas nickel and magnesium. This new approach to the synthesis of metal-zeolite \n\ncomposite increases the mesoporosity and improves the catalytic performance in \n\nhydrogenation of aromatics and anisole acylation. \n\n \n\nKeywords: hierarchical zeolite, hard template, cobalt, catalysis, catalytic reactions \n\n\n\nx \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nAs ze\u00f3litas s\u00e3o s\u00f3lidos cristalinos microporosos com um sistema de poros regular que \n\nt\u00eam encontrado in\u00fameras aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em processos industriais, como refino de petr\u00f3leo, \n\ns\u00edntese org\u00e2nica, adsor\u00e7\u00e3o e separa\u00e7\u00e3o.

Nos catalisadores preparados via \n\nimpregna\u00e7\u00e3o, o cobalto ocupa as posi\u00e7\u00f5es de troca cati\u00f4nica nos microporos das \n\nze\u00f3litas, diminuindo o n\u00famero de s\u00edtios \u00e1cidos dispon\u00edveis para a isomeriza\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nfracionamento de hidrocarbonetos. O isolamento de \u00edons cobalto em posi\u00e7\u00f5es cati\u00f4nicas \n\nreduz a redutibilidade do catalisador, dificultando a obten\u00e7\u00e3o do estado met\u00e1lico e \n\ndiminuindo a quantidade de s\u00edtios met\u00e1licos ativos dispon\u00edveis para a s\u00edntese de Fischer \n\nTropsch.

Foram sintetizadas ze\u00f3litas hier\u00e1rquicas \n\nutilizando nanotubos de carbono contendo cobalto, uma vez que o uso de templates \n\n\n\nxi \n\n \n\nr\u00edgidos resultou em maior atividade catal\u00edtica, menor seletividade a metano e maior \n\nseletividade a hidrocarbonetos isomerizados na s\u00edntese de Fischer-Tropsch.

Une tr\u00e8s \n\npetite taille des pores des z\u00e9olithes (~1 nm) impose des limitations diffusionelles pour \n\ndes nombreuses r\u00e9actions catalytiques.

The \n\nmajor challenge in the heterogeneous catalysis is catalyst design with good activity, \n\nhigh selectivity and satisfactory stability. For this reason many researchers are looking \n\nfor new approaches to the catalyst design \n[1]\n\n. Use of bifunctional catalysts can \n\nadvantageous for multistage catalytic reactions, because these materials contain both \n\nmetallic sites over  metal nanoparticles and acid sites from support (e.g. metals combine \n\nwith zeolite) \n[2]\n\n. Design of efficient bifunctional catalysts remains however, a major \n\nchallenge. \n\nZeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with uniform micropores with pores size \n\nsmaller than 2 nm. These minerals have been widely used for adsorption, membrane \n\nseparation and in the field of catalysis. The zeolite main properties are ordered \n\nmicroporosity and presence of Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid sites. The crystalline framework \n\ngives zeolites mechanical and high thermal stability, high specific surface area and high \n\nion-exchange capacity \n[3\u20136]\n\n. \n\nThe zeolite properties, mainly their strong acid sites and their thermal stability, \n\nmake them promising materials for catalysis \n[7]\n\n. Zeolite can be used as acid or as  \n\nbifunctional catalysts when a metal has been added to the structure \n[8]\n\n. Conventional \n\nways to introduce metals into the zeolites are through impregnation or ion exchange. \n\nHowever, this can lead to the neutralization of some acid sites in the zeolites \n[9]\n\n. The \n\nmetal ions introduced by impregnation or ion exchange will probably occupy a cation \n\nexchange position, decreasing the acid sites available in the zeolite \n[10]\n\n. The number of \n\nacid sites is extremely important for many catalytic reactions occurring on zeolites. For \n\nexample, the transformation of syngas into branched hydrocarbons is easier when more \n\nacid sites are available in the bifunctional catalysts. The presence of acid sites favors \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nhydrocarbon cracking and isomerization. Another issue concerning the location of the \n\nmetal in the support is the difficult reduction of the metal for metallic state, which leads \n\nto a lower amount of metal active phase. The metal distribution on the outer surface and \n\nin the micropores of the zeolite is an important parameter, which could affect the \n\ncatalytic performance of metal zeolite composite catalysts \n\nIn addition, conventional zeolites exhibit diffusion limitations in particular, for \n\nbulky molecules as a result of their small micropores. One of solutions to reduce \n\ndiffusion limitations over zeolite catalysts is synthesis of mesoporous or hierarchical \n\nzeolites. There are two major ways to create mesoporosity in zeolites, known as top-\n\ndown and bottom-up methodologies. The classical top-down methods consist of \n\nphysical and chemical treatments, such as desilication and dealumination \n[11,12]\n\n. This \n\napproach may cause a broad distribution of mesopores and an instability in the zeolite \n\nstructure because a part of the zeolite will be destructed by removing silicon or \n\naluminum. In the bottom-up strategies soft and/or hard templates are used. This \n\nprocedure is performed by introducing solid material, normally a rigid structure, into the \n\nzeolite gel. Therefore, the zeolite crystallization occurs around the template during the \n\nhydrothermal treatment and, when the template is removed by combustion or \n\ndissolution, the mesoporous are created \n[4]\n\n. \n\n \n\n1.1 Challenges in the design of bifunctional catalysts and goals of the thesis \n\nIn this literature review, two major challenges have been identified in the design \n\nmetal-zeolite bifunctional catalysts. The first challenge is relevant to the small pore \n\nsizes of the zeolites, which results in major diffusional limitations. One of the possible \n\nsolutions could be design of hierarchical zeolites with enhanced mesoporosity. The \n\nsecond challenge in bifunctional catalysts is relevant to the localization of the metal and \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nacid sites with the zeolites. It is often considered that the proximity between metallic \n\nand acid sites is particularly important to obtain enhanced catalytic performance in the \n\ncatalytic reactions requiring bifunctional catalysts. At the same time, localization of \n\nmetal species in the zeolite micropores can be harmful for catalytic performance. It can \n\nlead to decrease in the zeolite acidity due to the neutralization of acid sites by metal \n\ncations. Small metal oxide particle size can also result in poor metal reducibility.  \n\nThe present PhD thesis focuses on the design of new synthesis strategies for the \n\npreparation of hierarchical nanocomposites of metal and zeolite and their application in \n\ncatalysis. We suppose that the control of localization of metal nanoparticles within the \n\nzeolite micro and mesopores can influence on the selectivity of catalytic reactions and \n\nin particular Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. \n\nThe first goal of this thesis is to optimize the impregnation sequence while \n\nintroducing cobalt ions on the metal localization in zeolite and catalytic performance in \n\nFT synthesis. Cobalt is introduced by impregnation either to the sodium or proton forms \n\nof large pore BEA zeolite. Higher reaction rates are observed over the catalysts, which \n\ndid not contain cobalt ions in the cation sites of the zeolite. Lower methane selectivity \n\nand higher selectivity to isomerized hydrocarbons are observed when cobalt species are \n\nlocated on the zeolite outer surface and acid sites inside the zeolite micropores. The \n\nBEA zeolite has relatively large pores. The situation could be different for ZSM-5 with \n\nnarrow zeolite pores (d= 5.5 \u00c5) and the diffusion limitation in ZSM-5 zeolites can \n\nbecome much more severe. The preferential localization of cobalt species on the outer \n\nsurface of ZSM-5 might not be therefore optimal for the enhanced catalytic \n\nperformance. \n\nThe second goal of the thesis is to create hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite using \n\ncarbon nanotubes (CNT) with different diameters as sacrificial template. Our target is to \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nobtain in a one-pot synthesis composite hierarchical zeolites with cobalt metal particles \n\nuniformly distributed in the zeolite mesoporous structure. The cobalt zeolite catalysts \n\nprepared using cobalt carbo nanotubes as secondary templates showed enhanced \n\nselectivity to iso-paraffins. \n\nFinally, the third goal of the thesis is to extend the methodology, which involves \n\nusing cobalt CNT as secondary templates to other metals such as nickel (Ni) and \n\nmagnesium (Mg) introduced into the ZSM-5 zeolites. We uncovered three roles of Me-\n\nCNT in the zeolite synthesis. First, they strongly affect the shape of the synthesized \n\nzeolites, which seem to be replicas of CNT and show distinct fibrous morphology. \n\nSecond, the Me-CNT act as mesoporogen and strongly enhance the zeolite mesoporous \n\nvolume. Finally, zeolite synthesis in the presence of Me-CNT offers the opportunity to \n\nsimultaneously introduce new catalytic functions leading to bifunctional metal-zeolite \n\ncatalysts. The catalysts designed using this methodology were evaluated on model \n\nreactions such as aromatics hydrogenation by Ni catalyst and anisole acylation for all \n\ncatalysts (Ni, Co and Mg). \n\nThe main results of this thesis are published and submitted in the papers below: \n\n2018 - Influence of Impregnation and Ion Exchange Sequence on Metal \n\nLocalization, Acidity and Catalytic Performance of Cobalt BEA Zeolite Catalysts \n\nin Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Camila Flores, Nuno Batalha, Nilson R.

After analysis of the literature, Chapter 2 summarizes challenges for the \n\ndesign of new zeolite based catalysts. The goals of this thesis are also defined in this \n\nchapter. \n\n \n\n2.1 Zeolites: structure, porosity, acidity and catalysis \n\nZeolites are microporous aluminosilicates with crystalline structure formed by \n\nAlO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra linked via their edges. The zeolites are important as industrial \n\ncatalysts in petroleum refining (e.g. catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, isomerization, \n\nalkylation, fuels etc.) and chemical processes such as oxidation of olefins, fragrance \n\nsynthesis \n[13]\n\n. The main synthetic zeolites used in these processes are Mordenite \n\nFramework Inverted (MFI), Faujasite (FAU) and Beta (BEA). They have been \n\ncommercialized as catalysts \n[14]\n\n.  \n\nZeolite materials present specific features such as large surface area, high \n\nthermal stability, high ion-exchange capacity, presence of strong acid sites and shape-\n\nselectivity \n[5]\n\n. However, the structural micropores of zeolite become their disadvantage \n\nfor the mass transfer of bulky molecules causing diffusion limitations for reagents, \n\nintermediates and products \n[15]\n\n. In the last years, numerous works have been performed \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nin order to create zeolites with mesopores and to minimize the diffusional \n\nlimitations \n[16]\n\n. \n\n2.1.1 Structure  \n\nThe zeolites are structured in a crystalline form composed of tetrahedron of TO4 \n\n(T is Si or Al in a natural zeolite and can be others elements such as Ga, Ge, Fe, B, P, Ti \n\nin a synthetic material) connected through oxygen atoms (Figure 2-1) \n[17]\n\n. Zeolite \n\nstructure contains channels and cavities, with the sizes of around 1 nm, which are \n\naccessible for many molecules \n[18]\n\n. The combination of silicon and oxygen in tetrahedra \n\nleads to formation of an uncharged solid (SiO2). When the aluminum is incorporated in \n\nthe silica structure, the structure is charged negatively. This fact occurs through the \n\nAl\n3+\n\n ? Si\n4+\n\n substitution and requires the compensating cations to keep the overall \n\nframework neutral \n[19]\n\n.  \n\n \nFigure 2-1 Zeolite structure adaptaded from \n\n[20]\n. \n\nThe compensating cations (normally Na\n+\n or others alkaline or alkaline earth \n\nions) are transmutable ions, attributing this material an ion-exchange capacity, where \n\nthe metal ion could be changed by other cation (e.g. metal, ammonium and quaternary \n\nammonium). The zeolite composition can be described by the following empirical \n\nformula: \n\nT \n\nO2 \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n    \n                         \n\nwhere M is a compensating cation with the charge m, x and y are the number of Al and \n\nSi atoms in the unit cell and n is the number of water molecules. The silicon/aluminum \n\n(or simply Si/Al) ratio in the framework represents an important characteristics, since it \n\ndetermines the acidity and ion-exchange capacity.  \n\nThe structure of zeolites involves blocks of 3, 4, 5 and 6 membered rings (MR), \n\neach MR is linked with nT and O atoms, thus all oxygen atoms are connected with 2 T \n\natoms. Thus, a 6 MR contains 12 atoms which can be T atoms or oxygen atoms. \n\nZeolites can be classified into three categories according to their porosity: \n\n- Small pore (8 Membered ring): the pores are constituted of 8 atoms (T or O) and \n\nthe diameter size is between 0.3 to 0.45 nm (e.g. LTA). \n\n- Medium pore (10 Membered ring): the pores are composed of 10 atoms (T or O) \n\nand the diameter size is between 0.45 to 0.60 nm (e.g. MFI). \n\n- Large pore (12 Membered ring): presents 12 atoms (T or O) and the pore \n\ndiameter is between 0.60 to 0.80 nm (e.g. BEA). \n\nDepending on the pore class (small, medium or large), the zeolite can be used \n\nfor adsorption and in many catalytic reactions. There are several types of zeolites that \n\nhave a wide application on catalytic processes like faujasite (Y), beta (BEA) and MFI \n\n(ZSM-5), the use in these processes is linked with their properties such as high surface \n\narea, acidity and thermal stability \n[21,22]\n\n. \n\nBEA has ring channels with twelve tetrahedra that intersect on three-dimensions \n\nand different opening size, the first with 5.5 \u00c5 x 5.5 \u00c5 and two others of 7.6 \u00c5 x 6.4 \u00c5 \n\n(Figure 2-2). The range of Si/Al ratio is 10-100, it can reach 150. The greater is the \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nSi/Al ratio of zeolite, higher is the thermal stability.  The Beta zeolite has relatively \n\nlarge micropores, high surface area (600 m\u00b2/g), shape selectivity, ion exchange capacity. \n\nThe large micropores of BEA zeolite allow selective absorption of bulky molecules, \n\nsuch as aromatic hydrocarbons \n[23]\n\n.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-2 Polymorph of BEA zeolite \n[24]\n\n. \n\nZSM-5 (MFI zeolite) has a structure formed by unit cells with ten rings of five T \n\natoms, which are united by oxygen atoms to a similar chain, thus forming channels \n\n(Figure 2-3). These channels form a three-dimensional structure of ZSM-5 zeolite. \n\nZSM-5 presents also a high ratio of silicon to aluminum (Si/Al>11) \n[25]\n\n. This ratio has \n\nstrong influence on the capacity ion-exchange, that the greater is quantity of aluminum \n\nin the framework, greater will be the amount of charge-compensating cation \n[26]\n\n. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-3 Formation of layers of tetrahedrons of ZSM-5 zeolite \n[27]\n\n. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Porosity and hierarchical zeolites \n\nDespite many interesting properties, zeolites display difficulties for mass \n\ntransport of chemical compounds, which have the size of the molecules similar to the \n\nzeolite micropores. The small pores reduce the transport of reagents towards the active \n\nsites, consequently forming the undesired by-products and coke deposits. This may also \n\nresults in blocking the zeolite micropores and a fast catalyst deactivation and their short \n\nlife-time \n[5,28]\n\n. It is necessary therefore to improve transport properties of the zeolite by \n\ncreating mesopores (according to IUPAC the mesopore sizes vary from 2 to 50 nm) \n\n(Figure 2-4). \n\n \n\nFigure 2-4 Schematic diffusion of reagents and products through the pores ZSM-5 \n\nzeolite (adapted from \n[29]\n\n). \n\n \n\nIn order to overcome these, numerous efforts have made to synthesize nano-\n\nsized zeolite crystals, extra-large pore zeolites or mesoporous zeolites,  the latter are \n\noften referred to as hierarchical zeolites \n[30]\n\n. The hierarchical zeolites contain, in \n\naddition to the well-defined micropore system, mesopores with the diameters in the \n\nrange of 2-50 nm. Different to zeolite micropores, the size, shape and orientation of \n\nthese mesopores are not directly related to the zeolite crystalline structure. Hierarchical \n\nporous zeolite materials begin to gain space in the research due to their reduced \n\ndiffusion limitation on the reactions and improved accessibility of active sites. The \n\nzeolite mesopores can also delay catalyst deactivation \n[31]\n\n. Several synthesis strategies \n\nhave been proposed to obtain hierarchical zeolites, which are divided into \u201ctop-down\u201d \n\nReagent Zeolite Product\n\ndiffusion limitation\n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nand \u201cbottom-up\u201d (Figure 2-5). The first approach consists in creating a hierarchical \n\nzeolite starting from already synthetized zeolite. The main techniques used are \n\ndealumination using acid and desilication using alkaline solutions \n[17]\n\n.  \n\nDealumination is based on removing Al atoms in the zeolite post-synthesis \n\ntreatment. This method can be realized in two ways. The first way involves chemical \n\nagents like H4DTA, ammonium fluorosilicate ((NH4)2SiF6) in the liquid-phase and \n\nsilicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) in the gas-phase reactions, the dealumination occurs by Al \n\nleaching. Another way of zeolite dealumination is carried out at high temperature (873-\n\n1073 K) via steaming process. This treatment leads to the hydrolysis of -Si-O-Al- \n\nbonds. The Al atoms are then detached from original zeolite structure. Beyond, these \n\nboth methods can be used together \n[32]\n\n.  \n\nDesilication is a method well known for creating the secondary porosity in \n\nzeolites. It involves silicon extraction from zeolite framework using alkaline solutions \n\n(e.g. NaOH), basically preserving aluminum and the acidic properties \n[5,33\u201335]\n\n. \n\nHowever, by using the \u201ctop-down\u201d methodology it is difficult to control the \n\ncreation of uniform mesopores. It might lead to the partial destruction of zeolite \n\nstructure \n[36]\n\n. The \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach is considered more challenging for the \n\nresearchers because it depends on templates and conditions of zeolite synthesis, such as \n\nhard and soft templating \n[37]\n\n. Both hard and soft templates have been utilized to \n\nsynthetize hierarchical zeolites using the \u201cbottom up\u201d approach. The hard templates \n\nusually include carbon nanoparticles, nanotubes and polymer beads, while various \n\ncationic surfactants, organosilane, cationic polymer, and ionic liquids   are considered as \n\nsoft secondary templates. Both hard and soft templates could be removed by \n\ncalcination. There are numerous reports in the literature that address using templates for \n\nobtaining mesopores in zeolites. Zhang et al. \n[38]\n\n used bifunctional (TPABr-grafted \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nMWCNT) template to synthesize hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, Wang et al. \n[26]\n\n used \n\norgano-functionalized mesoporous silica (MS) as silica source to create the spherical \n\nself-assemblies of ZSM-5 nanocrystals. Huang et al. \n[39]\n\n synthesized a hierarchical Beta \n\nzeolite using a layered silicate precursor (H-kanemite) as silica source. Several \n\nmethodologies, which involve soft and rigid/hard templating for creating hierarchical \n\nzeolites are described below. \n\nDouble templating is carried out with different types of surfactants (e.g. CTMA, \n\nCTAB). Those molecules tend to create micelles in aqueous solutions. The surfactant is \n\nremoved by calcination or washing, thereby, forming mesostructure in the solids \n[40, 41]\n\n.  \n\nRigid or hard templating consists of using hollow or porous solids, which \n\nincorporate zeolites during their synthesis and create mesopores on their removal. The \n\nmethodology may be described by the following general three steps: (a) a solution \n\ncontaining the reagents and zeolite precursors is added into the pores/cavities of the \n\ntemplate, (b) zeolite crystals are growing within the hard template, (c) the template is \n\nremoved by calcination (organic templates) or dissolution processes (inorganic \n\ntemplates). The most usable hard templates are carbonaceous (e.g. carbon nanotubes \n\n(CNT), carbon fibers) and polymer microspheres (e.g polystyrene) \n[17, 42-43]\n\n.  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-5 Approaches for creating a hierarchical zeolite \n[44]\n\n. \n\nBecause of the presence of mesoporosity, the molecular diffusion is substantially \n\nimproved over hierarchical zeolites. The mesoporosity is able to reduce the molecule \n\nresidence time inside the pores avoiding secondary reactions, increasing lifetime and \n\nminimizing the catalyst deactivation. Zeolite with large pores can be applied in different \n\nreactions such as cracking, alkylation, isomerization, oxidation, condensation among \n\nothers \n[45,46]\n\n. Furthermore, another challenge beyond creating mesopores is design of \n\nbifunctional catalysts by encapsulation of metal nanoparticles in zeolite micro- and \n\nmesopores. It is believed that the metal confined in the crystals of zeolite can improve \n\ncatalytic performance, activity and stability in Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and \n\nother reactions \n[47]\n\n.  \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acidities \n\nAcidity of the zeolites is related to their structure and chemical composition. The \n\nzeolite acid sites are mostly localized inside their pores. Therefore, zeolite can be used \n\nin a safer way than sulphuric acid for example, which is a highly corrosive liquid \n[48,49]\n\n. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nCatalytic activity of zeolite is often correlated with the number and types of Br\u00f6nsted \n\nand Lewis acid sites present in this solid structure \n[32]\n\n. \n\nThe amount and strength of acid sites are affected by Al concentration and \n\ndistribution in the zeolite framework. The zeolite acidity occurs through substitution of \n\nSi\n4+\n\n atoms with Al\n3+\n\n atoms, which produces a negatively charged structure. This charge \n\nneeds to be compensated, a proton is linked to neighbour oxygen between one Si and \n\none Al, forming a hydroxyl group (Si-O(H)-Al), which is responsible for Br\u00f6nsted \n\nacidity \n[50]\n\n. Aluminum concentration in the lattice is directly proportional to the \n\nconcentration of acid sites in the zeolites \n[7]\n\n. The formation of Br\u00f6nsted sites from the \n\nsodium form of zeolite is presented in Figure 2-6. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-6 Formation of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites in zeolites (adapted from \n[51]\n\n). \n\nThe Lewis acid sites in zeolites are formed during the calcination (>500 \u00baC) \n\nowing the dehydroxylation of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites (Figure 2-7) \n[49]\n\n.  \n\nSynthesized zeolite  \n\nIon exchange with \n\nNH4\n+\n followed by \n\nheating \n\nAcid form \n\n(Br\u00f6nsted) \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-7 Formation of Lewis acid sites in zeolites (adapted from \n[51]\n\n). \n\nLewis acid sites are electron-receptors and are linked to aluminum atoms with \n\noctahedral coordination located extra framework of the zeolite. They can be also formed \n\nby low coordinated T atoms inside the zeolite framework. Aluminum extra framework \n\nspecies may have different forms like Al\n3+\n\n, Al(OH)\n2+\n\n, AlO\n+\n and exhibit a weak \n\nBr\u00f6nsted acidity \n[52]\n\n.  \n\nThe nature of acid sites may be characterized by NH3-stepwise temperature-\n\nprogramed desorption (NH3-STPD), infrared spectrometry (IR) with molecular probes \n\n(NH3, pyridine, acetonitrile etc), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and \n\nmicrocalorimetry among others \n[53, 54]\n\n. Infra-red spectroscopy is a technique most \n\ncommonly used for measuring the acidity in porous solids. Generally, pyridine is used \n\nas a probe molecule. The pyridine interaction with of Br\u00f6nsted or Lewis acid sites forms \n\nadsorbed species with characteristic vibrational frequencies that correlate with the type \n\nand concentration of acid sites. The quantification of the species may be done by the IR \n\npeak area integration \n[55- 56]\n\n. \n\n \n\nBr\u00f6nsted acid site\n\nLewis acid site\n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n2.1.4 Bifunctional catalysis and catalysts \n\nThe concept of multi-functional catalysis was developed in the 60s of last \n\ncentury by Weiss \n[57]\n\n. Bifunctional catalysts are those that present two types of active \n\nsites. These kinds of catalysts usually have metallic sites, whose function is \n\ndehydrogenation/hydrogenation and acid sites, whose main function is to conduct acid \n\ncatalyzed reactions (e.g. cracking, isomerization and others) \n[58]\n\n. The components \n\nresponsible for hydro-dehydrogenation may be of several types: (a) transition or noble \n\nmetals with good dispersion such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and other, (b) metal \n\nsulphides and (c) metal oxide such as cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) \n\nsupported on zeolite. Bifunctional catalysts employed in industrial processes often \n\ncontain Pt, which plays a role in hydrogenation-dehydrogenation. The presence of \n\nmetallic sites in these catalysts is of fundamental importance. They can catalyze  \n\nreactions such as hydrogenation-dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, aromatization and \n\nhydrocarbon cyclization \n[59-60]\n\n. \n\nMetallic sites usually catalyze hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions, while \n\nacid sites catalyze the carbocation rearrangements. There is an association between the \n\nacid and metallic sites in bifunctional catalysts, which increases catalytic activity and \n\nproduct yield. Therefore, a balance and a synergy of the acid and metallic sites in \n\nbifunctional catalysts is extremely important. It often determines activity, stability and \n\nproduct selectivity \n[54, 61]\n\n. The activity and selectivity of catalysts depend on the acid \n\nsupport. Generally the reaction rate of isomerization of n-paraffins is limited both by \n\ncatalytic activity of acid support and activity of metal function \n[62,63, 64]\n\n. \n\nStrength of acid sites and distribution of metal and acid sites are important \n\nparameters of bifunctional catalysts. In bifunctional catalysis, the kinetic steps of the \n\nconsequent reactions are coupled to each other through the processes of diffusion of \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nthese intermediates from one type of sites to another. The two types of active sites in \n\nbifunctional catalysts should be as closer as possible for attaining higher catalytic \n\nactivity and selectivity \n[65]\n\n. The metals can be introduced into zeolite by different \n\nmethodologies, the most used is incipient wetness impregnation (IW or IWI), also \n\ncalled capillary impregnation or dry impregnation \n[66]\n\n. \n\nWet impregnation consists in adding to the catalytic support a solution \n\ncontaining metal precursor that filling the zeolite pores followed by drying, \n\ncalcination/reduction steps. This technique is called \u201cincipient wetness impregnation\u201d, \n\nwhen the volume of solution is equal or smaller than the total pore volume of the \n\nsupport \n[10]\n\n. \n\n \n\n2.2 Reactions occurring on metal-zeolite catalysts \n\n2.2.1 Model reactions on acid sites  \n\nThe model reactions are used as tools for characterizing the active basic, acid or \n\nacid-basic solid supports. Those reactions are summarized in Table 2.1 with some \n\nexamples of zeolite catalysts. \n\nTable 2-1 Model reactions on zeolite acid sites. \n\nType of Reaction Typical applications and catalysts \n\n \n\nIsomerization \nBifunctional Pt/Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst for xylene \n\nisomerization \n[67]\n\n. \n\nCracking \nSO4\n\n2?\n/TiO2 promotion on HZSM-5 for catalytic cracking \n\nof paraffin \n[68]\n\n. \n\nOligomerization \nButene oligomerization reaction \n\nover the hemicellulose modified HZSM-5 \n[69]\n\n. \n\nFriedel-Crafts \n\nBenzene alkylation with methanol over ZSM-5 \n\nzeolite \n[70]\n\n. \n\nFriedel-Crafts acylation reactions over hierarchical \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nMCM-22 zeolites \n[71]\n\n. \n\nAcylation of ansiole with long-chain carboxylic acids \n\nover wide pore zeolites \n[72]\n\n. \n\nEffects of acid-modified HBEA zeolites on thiophene \n\nacylation and the origin of deactivation of zeolites \n[73]\n\n. \n\n \n\nIsomerization is a reaction leading to the production of isomers (same molecular \n\nsize, type and atoms number but with different molecular arrangement) \n[74]\n\n. The \n\nhydrocarbon isomerization is conducted for obtaining branched isomers, because they \n\nare chemical compounds with a high commercial value. The octane number of the \n\nbranched hydrocarbons is higher than that for linear compounds. \n\nOlefin isomerization is a fast reaction, while isomerization of paraffins is slower \n\nand requires very high temperatures. The paraffin isomerization reaction occurs on \n\nbifunctional catalyst with acid sites for isomerization by carbenium ions produced from \n\nolefins and metallic sites for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation from paraffins to olefins \n\nand vice versa. Assuming the classical mechanism, the paraffins dehydrogenate first on \n\nthe metal sites and the protonated olefins are produced over the Br\u00f6nsted acid sites. \n\nCarbenium ions rearrangement and ?-scission follows by hydrogenation and \n\ndeprotonation on metal sites towards the paraffins \n[62,75]\n\n. This mechanism can be \n\ndescripting by following steps occurred over bifunctional catalysts \n[8]\n\n: \n\n(a) Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation over metal sites; \n\n(b) Protonation/deprotonation on acid sites; \n\n(c) Proton addition to form alkyl-carbenium ion on acid sites; \n\n(d) Competitive absorption/desorption of carbenium ion and alkene over acid sites; \n\n(e) Rearrangement of alkyl-carbenium ion; \n\n(f) Cracking of alkyl-carbenium ion. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nAcid supports of bifunctional catalysts can be amorphous oxides, mixtures of \n\noxides (e.g Al2O3, Si2O-Al2O3), zeolite (Y, BEA, ZSM-5), silicoaluminophosphate \n\n(SAPO-11, SAPO-231), mesoporous materials (MCM-41, AIMCM-41) \n[38,76,77]\n\n. \n\nCracking is a reaction, which involves a rupture of the C-C bonds of \n\nhydrocarbons. It occurs upon acid active sites of solid surfaces after formation of \n\ncarbocations \n[78]\n\n. \n\nThe catalytic cracking of paraffins, like heptane, generally starts with their \n\nprotonation by proton H\n+\n of the catalyst, after the formation of a five-ordered \n\ncarbocation, followed protolytic cracking, thereby, forming the first carbenium ions and \n\nparaffins. The carbenium ions are normally transformed into alkenes, regenerating again \n\nthe acid centers in which they were absorbed. The reaction proceeds through \n\nisomerization of carbocations. Many different species will suffer ?-scission, producing \n\nan olefin and a new carbocation \n[79]\n\n. \n\nOligomerization is a reaction that forms C-C bonds, yielding hydrocarbons \n\nwhich have a higher molecular weight. This reaction is favored at low temperature and \n\nhigh pressure. Oligomerization is an exothermic reaction; it causes a reduction in the \n\nnumber of molecules. This reaction is promoted by acid catalysts. The formed \n\noligomers are cracked mainly at higher reaction temperatures, modifying the cracking \n\nproducts distribution \n[80,81]\n\n. \n\nFriedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation are among the most important reactions \n\noccurring over zeolites. They synthesize mainly alkyl and ketone aromatics for fine \n\nchemistry, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agrochemical industries \n[82]\n\n.  \n\nAlkylation of aromatics involves hydrogen substitution of an aromatic ring with \n\nalkyl group through interaction of an alkylating agent with the catalyst. The alkyl group \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nis simultaneously added to the aromatic ring forming a complex ? as an intermediate \n\n(Figure 2-8) \n[83]\n\n. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-8 Friedel-Craft alkylation reaction \n[83]\n\n. \n\nAcylation reaction implies in the electrophilic substitution of an aromatic \n\nsubstrate with acyl, generally an acyl is halide, to form aromatic ketones (Figure 2-9) \n\n[84]\n.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-9 General acylation reaction adapted from \n[85]\n\n. \n\nThe catalysts used in both reactions are Lewis acid or Br\u00f6nsted acid such as \n\nAl2O4, FeCl3, TiCl4, HCl, HF. However, these catalysts present some disadvantages on \n\nthe environmental disposal like toxicity and corrosion. In view of this, it was necessary \n\nthe development the new solid heterogeneous acid catalysts \n[71, 73, 86, 87]\n\n.  \n\nWide ranges of acidity, Si/Al ratios and crystalline structure are advantages of \n\nzeolites over other kinds of superacids materials \n[88]\n\n. Spagnol and co-workers were the \n\nfirst to propose application of the BEA zeolite for the acylation of anisole with acetic \n\nanhydride \n[89]\n\n. Zeolites such as BEA, ZSM-5 and Y \n[85,90\u201392]\n\n have been also used for the \n\nacylation and alkylation reactions \n[93]\n\n. \n\nHX \nCatalyst\n\nH\n\nBenzene Acyl group\n\nR X\n\nO\n\nO\n\nR\n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Model reactions on metal sites \n\nHydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions occur on the catalysts that have \n\nmetallic functions (e.g. Pt, Pd, Rh). Metal sites can dehydrogenate saturated reactant \n\nmolecules to alkenes and hydrogenate olefin intermediates desorbed from acid sites \n[78]\n\n. \n\nThermodynamically, hydrogenation is likely to occur at low temperatures and \n\nhigh pressures, it is highly exothermic and causes a reduction in the number of \n\nmolecules. The hydrogen activation is conducted by metal catalyst and causes a rupture \n\nof the H-H bond. An example can be seen for hydrogenation reaction of the ethylene \n\nmolecule (Figure 2-10) and toluene (Figure 2-11) \n[94,95]\n\n . \n\n \n\nFigure 2-10 Ethylene hydrogenation reaction \n[96]\n\n. \n\nThe interest to toluene hydrogenation has been increasing because of more strict \n\nrequirements to the quality of diesel fuels as cetane number and the environmental \n\nlegislative rules. Toluene has similar properties but lower toxicity than benzene, for \n\nthese reasons it has been used in many applications replacing benzene. The Figure 2-11 \n\nshows toluene hydrogenation forming methyl-cyclohexane product and the catalytic \n\ncracking forming cyclohexane and methane as by-products \n[97\u2013100]\n\n. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-11 Toluene hydrogenation and products cracking \n[98]\n\n. \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis \n\nFischer Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is a reaction that produces hydrocarbons from \n\nsyngas (CO and H2). The syngas is obtained from coal, natural gas, and biomass and is \n\naimed for producing chemicals and fuels (Figure 2-12). FTS produces cleaner fuels and \n\nallows non-use or minimization of the use of petroleum resources \n[101\u2013103]\n\n. The interest \n\nto FTS strongly depends on the crude oil prices, which vary cyclically over last decades. \n\nThese days they are approaching 53 $ per barrel according to EIA, 2019. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-12 Conversion of non-petroleum sources to syngas for producing chemicals \n\nand liquids fuel (adapted from \n[104]\n\n). \n\nH2\n\nCatalyst\n\nToluene Methylcyclohexane\n\nCH3 CH3\n\nCH4\n\nCyclohexane Methane\n\nHydrogenation Product Cracking Products\n\nH\n\n2\n C\n\natalys\nt Tolu\n\nene \n\nMethylcyclohexane \n\n \n\nC\nH\n\n3\n \n\n \n\nC\nH\n\n3\n \n\n \n\nC\n\nH\n4\n\n \nCyclohe\n\nxane \nMethane \n\nHydrogenation \n\nProduct \nCracking Products \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nFischer Tropsch synthesis includes parallel and consecutive reactions, \n\ndetermined according to the operational conditions. Amongst them, the main are: \n\nParaffin synthesis: (    )                        \n\nOlefin synthesis:                        \n\nAlcohol synthesis:                       (   )       \n\nWater Gas Shift (WGS):                 \n\nBoudouard reaction (coke):             \n\nOxidation of metal:                 \n\nIn these reactions,   is the carbon number in hydrocarbons and alcohols. Several \n\nparameters can affect the performance of Fischer Tropsch synthesis, such as \n\ntemperatures, composition of the gas (H2/CO ratio) and type of catalysts.  \n\nThere are two types of FT processes: High Temperature Fischer-Tropsch \n\n(HTFT) and Low Temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT).  The first process (HTFT) \n\noperates at high temperatures at the range from 320 to 350 \u00baC and uses iron as catalyst. \n\nIt generates olefins, oxygenates and paraffins of gasoline range. In the LTFT process, \n\nthe reactions are carried out at lower temperatures (220 to 250 \u00baC) using iron or cobalt \n\ncatalysts. The process produces mainly long-chain linear paraffins. Indeed, the LTFT \n\nsynthesis will produce preferably middle distillates, which are used for formulation of \n\ndiesel fuels \n[61]\n\n. \n\nThe FT reaction mechanism consists of surface polymerization that yields a \n\nproduct distribution with different molecular weights, known as Anderson-Schulz-Flory \n\n(ASF) distribution \n[105]\n\n. The mechanism involves the following steps shown (Figure \n\n2-13): \n\n(1)  Reagent adsorption; \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n(2)  Chain initiation; \n\n(3)  Chain growth; \n\n(4)  Chain termination; \n\n(5)  Products desorption; \n\n(6)  Readsorption and secondary reactions. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-13 FTS mechanism \n[106]\n\n. \n\nThe distribution of hydrocarbon products is described by the ASF distribution \n\nvia Equation 1. \n\n   \n  \n\n(     )\n                                                                                                             (1) \n\nwhere    is the initiation chain,    is the termination chain and   is the chain-growth \n\nprobability. The chain growth towards olefins and paraffins is usually between 0.77 and \n\n0.93 \n[107]\n\n. The termination probability will be (1-?). The relation between growth chain \n\nand molar fraction of a hydrocarbon is defined the Equation 2. \n\n    (   )   \n                                                                                              (2) \n\nwhere    is a molar fraction of product with a carbon number  . The chain length \n\ndistribution can be predicted by the Schulz-Flory law (Figure 2-14) \n[108]\n\n. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-14 Hydrocarbons selectivity as ? function \n[108]\n\n. \n\nSeveral methods have been proposed for selectivity control in FT synthesis. \n\nFirst, catalytic cracking/isomerization of FT hydrocarbons can upgrade the reaction \n\nproducts to a specific fuel. Combination of FT synthesis process with hydrocracking \n\nand isomerization of long chain hydrocarbons restricts the hydrocarbon distribution to a \n\nmore convenient range \n[109]\n\n. The isomerization and cracking of FT hydrocarbons would \n\nlead to iso-paraffins or diesel fuels constituted by the C10-C20 hydrocarbons. This \n\nmultistage process, however, significantly reduces the efficiency of synthetic fuel \n\nproduction.  \n\nAn alternative to that multi-stage process would be utilization of bifunctional \n\ncatalysts containing an active FT component, e.g. cobalt (Co) or ruthenium (Ru), and an \n\nacid catalyst active for cracking and isomerization. The proximity between metal and \n\nacid sites is an important parameter of the bifunctional catalysts often governing \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nreaction rate and selectivities. Recently two additional methods for hydrocarbon \n\nselectivity control were proposed, which involve making use of nanoreactors \n[110]\n\n and \n\nmicroemulsions \n[111]\n\n. In these methods, the carbon chain length is limited by steric and \n\ndiffusion limitations \n[112]\n\n. \n\nFischer Tropsch mechanism is still under debates. Some mechanisms were \n\nproposed to literature which involve carbide, hydroxylcarbene and carbonyl insertion.  \n\n1) Surface carbide is formed firstly by CO and H2 dissociation on metal particles \n\nsupported, forming C1 intermediates (without oxygen atoms). After that, the carbide \n\nreacts with adsorbed hydrogen, generating intermediates such as CH, CH2 and/or CH3, \n\ndue to hydrogenation of carbon atoms. The chain growth is promoted by the insertion of \n\nCHx species to CxHy, it is adsorbed into the metal particle. The chain termination is \n\nfollowed by: (i) dehydrogenation to olefins, (ii) hydrogenation of CxHy intermediates to \n\nparaffins or (iii) disproportional growth of CxHy intermediates to paraffins or olefins. \n\nMethylene (CH2 adsorbed) is often considered the key intermediate specie (Figure \n\n2-15). \n\n \n\nFigure 2-15 Carbene mechanism\n [113]\n\n. \n\n2) Hydroxycarbene mechanism entailing partial hydrogenation of adsorbed CO to \n\nadsorbed hydroxycarbene (CHOH) species. Thereafter, it involves a condensation \n\nreaction of two \u2013CHOH species, with the elimination of water at the same time, forming \n\n\u2013 RCHOH intermediates (Figure 2-15). \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nThis mechanism explains the formation of paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons by OH \n\nbond elimination. \n\n3) Carbonyl insertion mechanism is essentially different of two mechanisms previously \n\nmentioned, because the CO molecule keeps unaltered. The growth of hydrocarbon chain \n\noccurs through CO insertion into the metal-alkyl bonds (Figure 2-16). \n\n \n\nFigure 2-16 Schematic representation of carbonyl insertion \n[113]\n\n. \n\nCarbonyl insertion mechanism is based on the results obtained with \n\norganometallic complexes and was proposed for the first time by Pichler and Schulz \n\n(1970). When catalysts on the basis of ruthenium or iron are used,  this mechanism is \n\noften supposed to occur \n[114]\n\n.  \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Catalysts \n\nThe right choice of catalysts for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis is one the most \n\nimportant factors in order to obtain high reaction yield. The catalysts must be active, \n\nselective and stable. If it is possible, they can be regenerated. Several metals can be used \n\nas catalysts in this reaction, the main are: cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru) and \n\nnickel (Ni) \n[115]\n\n.  \n\nThe iron catalysts normally are used because of their low cost. Besides that, \n\nthese catalysts present a good performance using syngas rich in CO or CO2, because of \n\ntheir high activity in the water gas shift reaction. The main disadvantages of iron \n\ncatalysts is lower activity and rapid deactivation by oxidation or sintering \n[116]\n\n.  \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nRuthenium is the most active catalyst for Fischer Tropsch synthesis, but its high \n\ncost and limited reserves make it impossible industrial application. \n[117,118]\n\n. \n\nCobalt-based catalysts present high activity, stability, C5\n+\n hydrocarbons \n\nselectivity and low activity in the WGS reaction. Cobalt catalysts are used in the low \n\ntemperature process (LTFT- Low Temperature Fischer Tropsch synthesis) for synthesis \n\nof diesel fuels, whereas at high temperatures they produce a lot of methane (CH4). \n\nBesides that, these catalysts have high activity in hydrogenation and tend to form \n\npreferably linear alkanes, undesirable in the gasoline production, one of the main \n\nproducts of HTFT process \n[119, 120]\n\n. In the state of the art catalysts, cobalt nanoparticles \n\nare dispersed on porous supports like Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, zeolites and others \n[9,121,122]\n\n. \n\nHigher activity, higher conversion per single pass, higher resistance to deactivation by \n\nwater, lower activity in WGS and lower amount of oxygenate products are main \n\nadvantages that cobalt presents in front of iron-based catalysts.  \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n1.

Higher concentration of ion exchangeable cobalt was \n\nobserved in the catalyst prepared by ion-exchange of the zeolite proton form. The \n\npresence of Na\n+\n instead of H\n\n+\n ions in the exchange positions of zeolite favored \n\ndeposition of cobalt on the external surface. The acid sites in the zeolite micropores can \n\nbe then restored by subsequent ion exchange of sodium with ammonium nitrate and \n\ncalcination. The catalytic performance of the cobalt zeolite catalysts prepared using \n\ndifferent impregnation and ion exchange procedures was tested in the Fischer-Tropsch \n\nsynthesis. Higher reaction rates were observed over the catalysts, which did not contain \n\ncobalt ions in the cation sites of the zeolite. Lower methane selectivity, higher \n\nselectivity to long chain hydrocarbons and high fraction of isomerized products are \n\nobserved when cobalt species are located on the zeolite outer surface and acid sites \n\ninside the BEA zeolite micropores. \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe depletion of fossil resources and increasing environmental concerns have \n\nled to the development of new catalytic processes from alternative and renewable \n\nfeedstocks. Natural gas and biomass can be transformed into syngas (CO+H2) by steam \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nreforming, partial oxidation or gasification. The syngas can be then converted into ultra-\n\nclean fuels over cobalt-based catalysts via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis \n[1-3]\n\n FT \n\nsynthesis is a \u201cnontrivial surface polymerization reaction\u201d \n[4]\n\n, with the reaction \n\nselectivity typically described by very broad Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution \n[1, 5]\n\n. \n\nConsequently, the major challenge of FT reaction is adjustment of the reaction \n\nselectivity in order to produce specific hydrocarbon fractions. \n\nSeveral methods were proposed for selectivity control in FT synthesis. Some of \n\nthem involve control of hydrocarbon selectivity by steric limitation and diffusion in \n\nnanoreactors and microemlusions \n[6-8]\n\n. The combination of FT synthesis with \n\nhydrocracking and isomerization of long-carbon chain hydrocarbons restricts the \n\nhydrocarbon distribution to a more convenient narrow range \n[9, 10]\n\n. Isomerization and \n\ncracking of FT hydrocarbons would lead to iso-paraffins or diesel fuels mostly \n\nconstituted by the C10-C20 hydrocarbons. This reaction can be performed over hybrid or \n\ncomposite catalysts containing an active FT component, e.g. Co or Ru, and an acid \n\ncatalyst active in cracking and isomerization. \n\nBecause of their high acidity and stability, zeolites have been often proposed as \n\nmost promising catalysts for hydrocarbon cracking and isomerization under FT \n\nsynthesis conditions \n[3, 11]\n\n. Impregnation is an effective method for the preparation of bi-\n\nfunctional cobalt-zeolite catalysts for the direct production of fuels from syngas \n[12-18]\n\n. \n\nNote however, that introduction of cobalt ions to the zeolite may result however, in the \n\nneutralization of the zeolite acid sites. This represents a major drawback of this method. \n\nCobalt ions, introduced during impregnation, can occupy cation exchange positions in \n\nthe zeolite micropores decreasing the number of acid sites available for hydrocarbon \n\nisomerization and cracking. In addition, the isolated Co ions in the cationic positions \n\ncan be very difficult to reduce to metallic state, thus decreasing the amount of available \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nmetal active phase for FT synthesis. Finally, it is known that the diffusion in zeolites is \n\nstrongly affected by the presence of exchange cations inside the micropores \n[19-21]\n\n. The \n\nmetal particles in the narrow zeolite micropores are more susceptible to suffer from \n\ndiffusion limitations due to the small pores of the zeolite in the presence of larger \n\ncompensation cations. The diffusion limitations in the zeolite micropores in particular \n\nfor carbon monoxide would lead to higher methane selectivity \n[22]\n\n. In addition, use of \n\nlarger compensation cations during impregnation can restrain diffusion of Co ions \n\ninside the zeolite pores during the ion exchange and thus affect cobalt distribution \n\nbetween the zeolite external surface and micropores of the zeolite. The diffusion of \n\nreagents, intermediates and reaction products is usually much faster in the H-from of the \n\nzeolites and more particularly in the BEA zeolite, which has larger pore diameters \n\ncompared to mordenite and most commonly used ZSM-5 zeolite. It can be also \n\nexpected that HBEA zeolite which has weaker Br\u00f6nsted acidity \n[13]\n\n than H-ZSM-5 \n\nmight reduce overcracking and exhibit higher selectivity to isomerized hydrocarbons. \n\nThis chapter focuses on the effect of the impregnation sequence while \n\nintroducing cobalt ions on the metal localization in zeolite and catalytic performance in \n\nFT synthesis. Cobalt was introduced by impregnation either to the sodium or proton \n\nforms of BEA zeolite. The as-prepared cobalt zeolite catalysts were calcined after the \n\nimpregnation and then submitted to NH4\n+\n ion exchange. The Br\u00f6nsted acidity was \n\nrestored in the zeolite by decomposition of NH4\n+\n ions at higher temperature. All \n\nsamples, before and after regeneration of the acid sites, were characterized by a wide \n\nrange of methods and tested in FT synthesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n3.2 Experimental Section \n\nCatalyst synthesis \n\nA commercial NH4BEA zeolite (Zeolyst, CP-814E, Si/Al=12.5) was used for \n\npreparation of all catalysts. The H\n+\n form of the BEA zeolite (HBEA) was obtained via \n\ncalcination of the parent NH4BEA sample at 450 \u00b0C for 4 h. The Na\n+\n form (NaBEA) \n\nwas prepared by two successive ion exchanges of HBEA with a 2 M NaCl (Janssen \n\nChimica, P.A) solution at 80 \u00b0C for 1 h (50 mL\u00b7gsample\n-1\n\n), followed by calcination at \n\n450 \u00b0C for 4 h. Cobalt and platinum were introduced to the HBEA and NaBEA zeolites \n\nthrough incipient wetness impregnation by using Co(NO3)2 (2.39 mol L\n-1\n\n solution) \n\n(Sigma- Aldrich, 98%) and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich) as precursors. The \n\namounts of precursors were calculated to obtain 20 wt.% of cobalt and 0.1 wt.% \n\nplatinum in the final samples. After the impregnation, the samples were calcined at \n\n450 \u00b0C for 4 h. The impregnated HBEA and NaBEA are denoted as Co/HBEA and \n\nCo/NaBEA, respectively. \n\nThe calcined Co/HBEA and Co/NaBEA catalysts were submitted to two \n\nsuccessive ion exchanges with 2 M NH4NO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) solution at 80 \u00b0C \n\nfor 1 h (50 mL\u2022gsample\n-1\n\n), followed by calcination at 450 \u00b0C for 4 h. The final samples \n\nafter the ion exchange with NH4\n+\n and calcination are denoted as CoH/HBEA and \n\nCoH/NaBEA. \n\n \n\nCatalyst characterization \n\nThe calcined samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) by using a \n\nD8 Advance diffractometer equipped with an energy dispersive type detector and a \n\nmonochromatic CuK? radiation source. The XRD patterns were measured using a step \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nof 0.02\u00b0 with an acquisition time of 0.5 s. The average size of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) \n\nnanoparticles was determined by the Scherrer equation. \n\nThe samples chemical composition was determined by ICP-OES analysis. The \n\nzeolite samples for the analysis were dissolved a mixture of aqua regia and hydrofluoric \n\nacid. Quantitative elemental analyses were performed by inductively coupled plasma-\n\noptic emission spectroscopy 720-ES ICP-OES (Agilent) with axially viewing and \n\nsimultaneous CCD detection. The quantitative determination of metal content in the \n\ncatalysts was made based on the analysis of certificated standard solution. The ICP \n\nExpertTM software (version 2.0.4) provides the weight percentage of components. \n\nThe textural properties of the samples were determined by N2 physisorption \n\nusing a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Prior to the analysis, the samples were \n\ndegassed under vacuum (10 \u00b5mHg) at 350 \u00b0C for 4 h. The total pore volume (TPV) was \n\ncalculated from the amount of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure P/P0 = 0.97. The \n\ncatalyst microporous volume (Vmicro) were calculated using the deBoer t-plot method. \n\nThe samples mesoporous volume was calculated as the difference between the total pore \n\nvolume and microporous volume. \n\nThe XPS spectra were taken using a Kratos Axis spectrometer, equipped with an \n\naluminum monochromater for a 1486.6 eV source working at 120 W. All spectra were \n\nrecorded under a vacuum of 10-8 Torr and recalibrated afterwards with the binding \n\nenergy of the Al 2p at 74.6 eV. \n\nThe catalyst Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acidities were measured using Infrared \n\nspectroscopy after pyridine adsorption on a Nicolet 8700 apparatus. The samples were \n\npretreated under vacuum (10-3 torr) at 450 \u00b0C for 2 h. After the pre-treatment, pyridine \n\n(1.2 mbar) was adsorbed on the sample at room temperature. The samples were then \n\nheated under vacuum (10-3 torr) at 150 \u00b0C and a spectrum was taken at room \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\ntemperature. The intensity of the Py-L and Py-H+ peaks at ~ 1455 and 1545 cm\n-1\n\n was \n\nmeasured as a function of temperature, and the resulting plots used to compare the \n\nzeolite acidity. \n\nFischer-Tropsch synthesis \n\nThe catalytic performance of the samples was tested in FT synthesis. The \n\nexperiments were performed in a fixed-bed reactor. Prior to testing, the samples were \n\nreduced in-situ in pure H2 gas flow at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h with a temperature ramping rate of \n\n3 \u00b0C/min. After the reactor was cooled down to room temperature, the flow was \n\nswitched to syngas (H2/CO = 2) and the pressure was adjusted to 20 bar. Nitrogen (5% \n\nof the CO flow) was used as internal standard. The flow was adjusted to obtain GHSV \n\nof 66 L/gCo.h-1). After achieving the desired pressure, the temperature was \n\nprogressively increased to the reaction temperature, i.e. 250 \u00b0C, at the ramping rate of \n\n3 \u00b0C/min. The gaseous reaction products, i.e. up to C5, were analyzed online using gas \n\nchromatography. The liquid products were condensed under pressure and analyzed off-\n\nline using a Shimatzu 2010-Plus-AF gas chromatograph. \n\n \n\n3.3 Results and Discussion \n\nCatalyst characterization \n\nThe catalyst characterization data are shown in Table 3-1. The H-form of BEA \n\nzeolite impregnated with cobalt (Co/HBEA) contains 13.7 wt.% of cobalt and only trace \n\namounts of sodium. The amount of cobalt added by impregnation to the sodium form of \n\nthe zeolite was almost the same (14.3 wt.%). Note that the Co/NaBEA samples \n\ncontained in addition to cobalt about 1 wt.% of sodium. Subsequent ion exchange of the \n\nCo/HBEA and Co/NaBEA samples with ammonia nitrate results in decrease in cobalt \n\ncontent in the catalysts. The decrease in cobalt content after the ion exchange with \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nNH4NO3 is more significant in the Co/HBEA catalyst. This suggests that Co/HBEA \n\ncontains a higher fraction of cobalt ion in the zeolite cation positions. Only very slight \n\ndecrease in cobalt content was observed in Co/NaBEA. Most of cobalt seems to be \n\npresent in this catalyst as cobalt oxide clusters rather than isolated cobalt ions in the \n\ncation sites. The ion exchange with ammonia nitrate leads to a major decrease in the \n\nconcentration of sodium in the Co/NaBEA zeolite.  \n\nThe Co3O4 oxide phase was identified in the catalysts using IR, Raman \n\nspectroscopies and XRD. The IR spectra of the cobalt zeolite catalysts are shown in \n\nFigure S1 (SI, Supporting Information). They exhibit the peaks at 670 and 555-\n\n600 cm\n?1\n\n, which were assigned to the ? (Co\u2013O) vibration modes in Co3O4 \n[23]\n\n. Note that \n\nthese bands overlap with the bands at 622, 525 and 468 cm\n-1\n\n related respectively to \n\ncoupled Al-O and Si-O out-of-plane vibrations, Al-O-Si and Si-O-Si bending vibrations \n\nin zeolite \n[24, 25]\n\n. The broad bands at 1350-1000 cm\n-1\n\n are due to asymmetric Si\u2013O(Si,Al) \n\nand Al\u2013OH bending vibrations. Figure S2, SI shows the Raman spectra of the catalysts. \n\nThey are also indicative of the presence of the Co3O4 phases. The intense band at \n\n667 cm\n-1\n\n is attributed to the cobalt octahedral sites (CoO6) \n[23, 26, 27]\n\n. The medium \n\nintensity bands at 465 and 505 cm\n?1\n\n correspond to the Eg and F2g\n(2)\n\n sites, respectively, \n\nwhile the weak band located at 606 cm\n?1\n\n has the F2g\n(1)\n\n symmetry.  \n\nThe cobalt oxide crystallite sizes in the calcined samples were estimated from \n\nbroadening of the Co3O4 characteristic XRD peak at 36.8\u00b0 (2?, Figure S3, SI). All the \n\nsamples showed similar cobalt oxide crystallite size, i.e. between 23-26 nm, once gain \n\nindicating that the secondary ion exchanges performed with CoH/HBEA and \n\nCoH/NaBEA had no effect on the size of larger cobalt oxide particles which are most \n\nprobably localized on the external surface of zeolite. Note that XRD might not be \n\nsensitive to the presence of much smaller cobalt oxide nanoparticles in the zeolite \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nmicropores (<1 nm). Indeed, sub-nanometric clusters of cobalt oxides located inside the \n\nmicropores of BEA zeolites prepared by impregnation were detected by STEM analysis \n\nin our recent publication \n[22]\n\n. \n\nThe porous volume and surface areas of zeolites significantly decreased after the \n\nimpregnation with cobalt compared to the parent samples. The reduction of the \n\nmesoporous and microporous volume observed after cobalt impregnation indicates that \n\ncobalt oxide nanoparticles are localized in both types of the pores. The microporous \n\nvolume decreases by 12% and 18%, respectively, on Co/HBEA and Co/NaBEA. This \n\nphenomenon can be explained by the presence of Co3O4 inside the zeolite \n\ncrystallites \n[28]\n\n. Higher loss of microporous volume observed on Co/NaBEA can be \n\ndirectly linked to the presence of Na\n+\n localized in the zeolite micropores. Slower \n\ndiffusion of cobalt ions in the micropores of Na/BEA results in preferential localization \n\nof cobalt ions in the entrances of the zeolite pores. This could lead to easier blocking of \n\nthe pores of NaBEA zeolite with cobalt species.  \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nTable 3-1 Catalyst Characterization. \n\n \n\nN2 Adsorption Acidity ICP-OES XPS (atom ratio) \n\nCo particle size \n\n(nm) SBET\nb\n \n\n(m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nVmeso\nb\n \n\n(cm\n3\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nVmicro\nb\n \n\n(cm\n3\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nBr\u00f6nsted\na\n \n\n(?mol.g\n-1\n\n) \n\nLewis\na\n \n\n(?mol.g\n-1\n\n) \n\nCo \n\n(wt.%) \n\nNa \n\n(wt.%) \nCo/Si Si/Al \n\nHBEAParent 704 0.54 0.188 115 52 - - - - - \n\nCo/HBEA 590 0.43 0.166 88 84 13.21 0.08 0.048 9.76 23 \n\nCoH/HBEA 570 0.37 0.168 116 137 8.89 0.08 0.036 10.37 25 \n\nCo/NaBEA 530 0.37 0.154 20 160 14.26 0.95 0.030 13.13 26 \n\nCoH/NaBEA 563 0.35 0.179 96 145 12.79 0.20 0.029 13.70 25 \n\na \nobtained by IR spectroscopy with pyridine adsorption at 150\u00b0C \n\nb \nvalues normalized per gram of zeolite \n\n \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nAfter regeneration of the catalyst acidity via ion exchange with NH4\n+\n ions and \n\ncalcination, CoH/NaBEA recovered most of the original microporosity, i.e. only 5% \n\nVmicro loss. Similarly, after NH4\n+\n ion exchange, Co/HBEA recovered a much smaller \n\nportion of micropore volume. The recovery of the zeolite micropore volume after ion \n\nexchange with NH4\n+\n is linked to the removal of Na\n\n+\n and Co\n\n2+\n exchanged species from \n\nthe zeolite framework. Consequently, more significant recovery of micropore volume \n\nwas observed on CoH/NaBEA. This indicates a lower concentration of sub-nanometric \n\ncobalt oxide clusters inside of the zeolite micropores of NaBEA compared to the BEA \n\nzeolite H-form.  \n\nIntroduction of cobalt ions to the zeolite also leads to the decrease in the \n\nmesoporous volume formed by intracrystalline spaces between zeolite crystals. \n\nInterestingly, different to microporous volume, the subsequent ion exchange does not \n\nresult in the reversible recovery of this volume. This indicates that, for all samples, the \n\ndecrease in mesoporous volume is principally due to the formation of cobalt oxide \n\nnanoparticles, which are non-soluble in aqueous solutions. These cobalt oxide \n\nnanoparticles, which form during catalyst calcination are located either in the mesopores \n\nor on the external surface of zeolite. This decreases interaction between the zeolite \n\ncrystallites and thus mesoporous volume \n[15, 21, 22].\n\n \n\nThe Co 2p XPS spectra (Figure 3-1) show that Co3O4 is the dominant cobalt \n\nphase in oxidized catalysts. For CoH/HBEA and CoH/NaBEA, the shapes and binding \n\nenergies of the Co2p line ( \n\nFigure 3-1) at 780 eV and low-intense shake-up satellite structure with spin-\n\norbital splitting of 15.2 eV were very similar to those of bulk Co3O4 \n[29]\n\n. Higher \n\nintensities of the satellite peaks, a shift of the XPS lines towards the higher energy \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nregion and an increase in spin-orbital splitting observed for the XPS spectra of \n\nCo/HBEA and Co/NABEA indicate the presence of Co\n2+\n\n ions \n[30, 31]\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3-1 Co 2p XPS spectra of the calcined cobalt BEA zeolite catalysts. \n\n \n\nIndeed, the Co/HBEA and Co/NaBEA samples prepared by impregnation of \n\nHBEA and NaBEA zeolite contain Co\n2+\n\n ions in the zeolite cationic sites in addition to \n\nthe Co3O4 crystallites. These cations are then removed by ion exchange with ammonium \n\nnitrate. The XPS Co/Si ratio (Table 3-1) almost does not change after the secondary ion \n\nexchange, while the cobalt content may decrease more significantly in particular for the \n\nCo/HBEA catalyst. This suggests that only a very small amount of cobalt is removed by \n\nion exchange from the zeolite outer surface. Indeed, cobalt is present in the subsurface \n\nlayers of the zeolite crystals mostly as Co3O4, which is refractory to the ion exchange. \n\n775780785790795800805810815\n\nBinding Energy, eV\n\nCo/HBEA\n\nCoH/HBEA\n\nCo/NaBEA\n\nCoH/NaBEA\n\nCo2p3/2\n\nCo2p1/2\n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nThe catalyst acidity was also impacted by the catalyst preparation method (Table \n\n3-1). Due to the presence of cobalt oxide and cobalt ions in the exchange positions of \n\nthe zeolite, the amount of Lewis acid sites was higher in the impregnated catalysts \n\ncompared to the pristine zeolite \n[32]\n\n. The zeolite Br\u00f6nsted acidity also depends on the \n\npresence of the compensation ions inside the zeolite micropores. As expected, in \n\nCo/NaBEA, the concentration of Br?nsted acid sites was much lower than on other \n\nsamples, due to the neutralization of the protonic sites by sodium. After NH4\n+\n exchange \n\nand calcination, the concentration of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites significantly increases due to \n\nthe removal of cobalt ions from the cation exchange positions in Co/HBEA and to the \n\nremoval of both cobalt and sodium ions from CoH/NaBEA. Still, the Br?nsted acidity in \n\nCoH/NaBEA remains slightly lower than in CoH/HBEA. Note that the NH4\n+\n ion \n\nexchange also results in the increase in the micropore volume because of the removal of \n\nbulky cations from the micropores (Table 3-1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3-2 TPR catalyst reduction profiles. \n\n \n\nThe TPR profiles (Figure 3-2) clearly show that the reducibility of cobalt \n\nnanoparticles is strongly affected by the presence of sodium ions in the zeolites during \n\nimpregnation. Typically, the reduction of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) to metallic cobalt under \n\nhydrogen atmosphere occurs in two consecutive steps: Co3O4 ? CoO ? Co \n[33]\n\n. \n\nCo/HBEA\n\nCoH/HBEA\n\nCo/NaBEA\n\nCoH/NaBEA\n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nThe two- step reduction is translated into two distinct peaks in the TPR profile. \n\nAccording to the stoichiometry, the area of the first peak should be 3 times smaller than \n\nthat of the second. Figure 3-2 suggests that the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO is easier \n\nwhen the cobalt was impregnated over the proton form zeolite as the first reduction peak \n\nin Co/BEA and Co/HBEA is observed at 190 \u00b0C instead of 290-310 \u00b0C. This effect \n\nmight be explained by hydrogen spillover in the presence of acid sites close to metal \n\noxide. In comparison, when the cobalt impregnation is performed over the sodium form \n\nof BEA zeolite, the cobalt reduction only starts at 310 \u00b0C. The first reduction peak \n\nslightly shifts to 290 \u00b0C after the zeolite exchange to acid form which might be \n\nexplained partial hydrogen transfer through zeolite acidity. Interestingly, this \n\nphenomenon is not observed for the second reduction peak (CoO to Co) with the \n\nhydrogen consumption peak appearing at the same temperature for all catalysts, i.e. \n\naround 420-430 \u00b0C. Previous reports \n[34, 35]\n\n suggest negative effect of alkali ions on \n\ncobalt reducibility. Note that no such effect was observed over Co/NaZSM-5 zeolite \n\n(Figure 3-2) which is probably due to separate localization of cobalt and sodium \n\nspecies. Cobalt is preferentially localized on the zeolite outer surface, while sodium ions \n\nare located in the cation positions inside the zeolite crystallites.  \n\nLocalization of cobalt species in CoH/HBEA and CoH/NaBEA zeolites after \n\nremoval of cobalt ions form the zeolite cation sites is illustrated in Figure 3-3.To \n\nsummarize, the CoH/HBEA and Co/HBEA catalysts prepared by impregnation using \n\nHBEA contain cobalt as cobalt ions and cobalt oxide nanoparticles both in the pore and \n\non the outer surface of the zeolite, while the Co/NaBEA and CoH/Na/BEA mostly \n\ncobalt oxide particles located on the surface of the zeolite crystallites.  \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3-3 Localization of cobalt species in the CoH/HBEA (a) and CoH/NaBEA \n\nzeolite (b). \n\n \n\nCatalytic performance in FT synthesis \n\nAll the catalysts showed significant reaction rate in FT synthesis. No changes in \n\nthe catalyst activity were observed during 100 h of the reaction. Nonetheless, the \n\ncatalyst activity and selectivity were significantly affected by the catalyst preparation \n\nmethod (Table 3-2).  \n\nAfter the NH4\n+\n ion exchange and calcination, the activity of the CoH/HBEA \n\ncatalysts increased by 132% compared to Co/HBEA and by 23% when comparing \n\nCoH/NaBEA to Co/NaBEA.  Higher activity observed on the catalysts after ion \n\nexchange could be explained by the removal of cobalt and sodium ions from the zeolite \n\nmicropores, higher concentration of zeolite Br?nsted acid sites and easier diffusion of \n\nreaction intermediates to the acid sites inside the zeolite crystallites. The effect of NH4\n+\n \n\nion exchange and calcination on the catalytic performance is more pronounced for \n\nCo/HBEA where higher amounts of cobalt ions and cobalt active phase are located \n\ninside of the micropores. Ion exchange results in the removal of cobalt ions from the \n\ncation sites and reappearance of Br\u00f6nsted acid sires. This result also indicates that the \n\nFT reaction rates are enhanced when cobalt nanoparticles and Br?nsted acid sites are \n\nlocated in the proximity \n[13]\n\n. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nOnce again, the catalytic data confirm distinct localization of cobalt and sodium \n\nspecies in Co/NaBEA samples. Alkali metal ions were reported \n[34, 35]\n\n to be poisons for \n\nconventional supported cobalt FT catalysts. Preferential localization of cobalt on the \n\nouter surface of NaBEA zeolite and sodium ions inside the zeolite pores leads to very \n\nweak interaction between cobalt and sodium in Co/NaBEA, very small cobalt poisoning \n\nand thus, a high catalytic activity of this sample. Similar phenomenon was observed \n\nearly Y-zeolites \n[36]\n\n. In the Y-zeolite, sodium had very small influence of the intrinsic \n\nactivity of cobalt species because of sodium preferential localization in small cages on \n\nY-zeolite, while cobalt was mainly present in the mesopores. \n\nThe product selectivities over different cobalt-zeolite catalysts are shown in \n\nTable 3-2 and Figure 3-4. Significant differences were observed as functions of catalyst \n\npreparation procedures. The selectivity towards methane was higher, when cobalt was \n\nimpregnated on HBEA when compared to NaBEA, i.e. 22.2% compared to 17.5%. \n\nHBEA zeolite contained cobalt nanoclusters localized in the zeolite pores where their \n\nsizes are limited by the the pore diameters. Previously it was shown \n[37]\n\n that cobalt \n\nparticle size smaller than 6 nm might lead to higher methane selectivity. In addition, \n\nlocalization of cobalt nanoparticles into the zeolite micropores in Co/HBEA introduces \n\ndiffusion limitations for carbon monoxide, which results in higher H2/CO ratio in the \n\nmicropores and thus, leads to higher methane selectivity \n[38]\n\n. Higher methane selectivity \n\nwas recently observed \n[22]\n\n over Co/zeolite catalysts containing cobalt nanoparticles only \n\ninside the zeolite crystals. The catalysts were prepared by selective extraction of cobalt \n\nfrom the zeolite outer surface using heteropolyacids. The Co/NaBEA contains mostly \n\ncobalt species on the zeolite external surface and was therefore less selective to \n\nmethane.  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nAfter the NH4\n+\n ion exchange, methane selectivity increases to 29% on \n\nCo/HBEA, whereas on CoH/NaBEA a slight decrease to 16.1% is observed. Similar \n\ntrends were observed for the C2-C4 hydrocarbon selectivity. Co/HBEA was less \n\nselective to the C5\n+\n hydrocarbons followed by CoH/HBEA, Co/NaBEA and \n\nCoH/NaBEA, respectively with 48.7, 63.9, 66 and 71.9%. The C2-C4 olefins to paraffins \n\nratio (Table 3-2) show slight differences between the samples \n[39, 40]\n\n. \n\nTable 3-2 Catalytic performance in FT at iso-coversion.* \n\n \nFT activity \n\n(molCO.gCo\n-1\n\n.h) \nXCO2\n\n% \nSCO2 SCH4 \n\nC2-C4 \nSC5+ \n\nIsomer \n\nfraction in \n\nC9+ wax, \n\n% \n\nAlpha \nSTotal \n\nOlefin / \n\nParaffin \nCo/HBEA 0.65 72 0.6 22.2 13.3 0.30 63.9 67 0.63 \n\nCoH/HBEA 1.51 74 1.6 29.0 20.7 0.22 48.7 63 0.48 \n\nCo/NaBEA 0.79 63 1.5 17.5 15.0 0.35 66.0 47 0.76 \n\nCoH/NaBEA 0.97 68 0.5 16.1 11.4 0.31 71.9 65 0.60 \n\n*Conversion is around 70% obtained though different GHSV (GHSV = 66 Lg.Co\n-1\n\n.h\n-1\n\n) \n\n \n\nThe wax composition for each catalyst is presented in Figure 3-5. The presence \n\nof n-paraffin and isomerized products was observed for all samples. No significant \n\ndifferences in the total isomer fraction among the catalysts were observed, with the \n\nexception of Co/NaBEA where a smaller amount of Br?nsted acid sites (Table 3-1) led \n\nto lower selectivity to branched hydrocarbons. The catalyst preparation method also \n\naffects the hydrocarbon chain length in the wax products. On Co/NaBEA, hydrocarbons \n\nup to 25 carbons were observed, whereas for CoH/HBEA the carbon chain growth was \n\nlimited to 20 carbons. The chain probability growth factor (?) determined by applying \n\nthe ASF distribution model (Table 3-2, Figure 3-5) showed that the samples capacity to \n\nproduce long carbon chain products decreases in the following order: \n\nCo/NaBEA>Co/HBEA>CoH/NaBEA>CoH/HBEA. The distribution of liquid products \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nseems to be affected by both localization of metal phase and concentrations of Br?nsted \n\nacid sites. \n\n \n\nFigure 3-4 Wax products (C9+) distribution. \n\n \nFigure 3-5 ASF distribution plot for the wax products obtained from the FT synthesis \n\nreaction. \n\n \n\nCo/NaBEA has lower concentration of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites, which are neutralized \n\nby Na\n+\n, and the metal was mostly located on the external surface of the zeolite. \n\nConsequently, the hydrocarbons formed on the metal sites on the zeolite outer surface \n\nwere less likely to undergo isomerization and cracking. Higher selectivity to long chain \n\nhydrocarbons was observed. \n\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nCarbon number\n\nCo/NaBEA\n\nn-paraffin\n\nisomer products\n\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nCarbon number\n\nCo/HBEA\n\nn-paraffin\n\nisomer products\n\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nCarbon number\n\nCoH/NaBEA\n\nn-paraffin\n\nisomer products\n\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nCarbon number\n\nCoH/HBEA\n\nn-paraffin\n\nisomer products\n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nOn CoH/NaBEA, the metal location is similar to Co/NaBEA. Most of cobalt is \n\nlocalized on the zeolite external surface. The zeolite Br\u00f6nsted acidity was obtained after \n\nexchange of Na\n+\n with NH4\n\n+\n ions and subsequent calcination. Consequently, the \n\nCoH/NaBEA sample showed improved isomerization and cracking rates compared to \n\nCo/NaBEA. On Co/HBEA, the metal species are located both on the external surface of \n\nzeolite and inside the micropores. Some of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites in Co/HBEA are \n\nneutralized by cobalt cations. The smaller size of the metal sub-nanometric cobalt \n\nclusters located in the confined space of the zeolite micropores and, the proximity to the \n\nacid sites contribute to shorter carbon chain length of the formed products \n[6, 37, 41, 42]\n\n. On \n\nthe one hand, localization of cobalt metal particles inside the zeolite micropores could \n\nlead to the diffusion limitations in particular for carbon monoxide and would increase \n\nlocally the H2/CO ratio. Higher H2/CO ratio would favor higher selectivity to methane \n\nand light hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the short diffusion pathway of the paraffins \n\nproduced over cobalt clusters located inside the zeolite framework to the acid sites \n\nimproves isomerization and cracking reactions and leads to the formation of smaller \n\ncarbon chain products. It is important to mention that the higher methane selectivity \n\nobserved on Co/HBEA and CoH/HBEA is directly linked to the FT synthesis, since \n\nmethane formation through ?-scission does not usually occur \n[43]\n\n and the protolytic \n\ncracking mechanism is unlikely to occur under the reaction conditions \n[44]\n\n. \n\nThe preferential deposition of cobalt on the BEA zeolite external surface was \n\nproven to be an effective way to achieve simultaneously high FT reaction rate and lower \n\nmethane selectivity. Removal of cobalt ions from the zeolite micropores by ion \n\nexchange results in the enhancement of the selectivity to the isomerized long chain \n\nhydrocarbons over Co/NaBEA zeolite. This catalyst has both high C5\n+\n selectivity and \n\nhigher fraction of isomerized hydrocarbons in the wax products. It is important to \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nmention that Na\n+\n ions are not bulky enough to completely stop diffusion of Co\n\n2+\n ions \n\ninside the micropores during impregnation. Consequently, the use of bulkier ions, e.g. \n\nK\n+\n, or direct impregnation after zeolite synthesis before template removal, might be \n\npossible options to reduce the cobalt ions diffusion inside the framework. The BEA \n\nzeolite has relatively large pores. The situation could be different for ZSM-5 with \n\nnarrow zeolite pores (d= 5.5 \u00c5) and in particular in the samples with larger zeolite \n\ncrystallites. The diffusion limitation in ZSM-5 zeolites can become much more severe. \n\nThe preferential localization of cobalt species on the outer surface of ZSM-5 might not \n\nbe optimal for the enhanced catalytic performance. \n\n \n\n3.4 Conclusion \n\nThe zeolite impregnation procedure and ion exchange sequence have a very \n\nstrong impact on the structure and localization of cobalt species in BEA zeolite and \n\ncatalytic performance in FT synthesis.  Occupation of the zeolite cation exchange sites \n\nby sodium ions favored deposition of cobalt during impregnation with cobalt nitrate on \n\nthe zeolite external surface. Cobalt deposition on the H-from of BEA zeolite via \n\nimpregnation results in cobalt localization both on the zeolite outer surface and in the \n\nzeolite micropores. \n\nSimultaneous deposition of cobalt on the BEA zeolite external surface and in the \n\nmicropores leads to cracking and higher methane selectivities. The sample with the \n\nmetal particles on the external surface and high concentration of Br?nsted acid sites in \n\nthe zeolite micropores, i.e. CoH/NaBEA exhibited lower methane, higher selectivity to \n\nlong chain hydrocarbons and significant yield of isomerized hydrocarbons. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n[1] A.Y.

The zeolite catalysts were \n\nprepared using carbon nanotubes as sacrificial templates. Addition of pristine carbon \n\nnanotubes resulted only in a slight increase in the zeolite mesoporosity, while the \n\npresence of carbon nanotubes impregnated with cobalt drastically modified the zeolite \n\nmorphology and texture. The zeolite mesoporous volume increased by 3-4 times. The \n\ncatalysts prepared using cobalt impregnated carbon nanotubes as templates showed 5-10 \n\ntimes higher Fischer-Tropsch reaction rates normalized by reducible cobalt compared to \n\nthe catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation. Higher selectivity to isomerized \n\nbranched hydrocarbons on these zeolites was attributed to the enhanced diffusion \n\nfavoring removal of isomerized products and avoiding their cracking. \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nThe depletion of fossil resources and increasing environmental concerns have \n\nled to the necessity for the development of new catalytic processes from alternative \n\nrenewable resources. Natural gas and biomass can be transformed into syngas (H2/CO) \n\nand subsequently by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis over cobalt-based catalysts into \n\nmiddle distillates and waxes \n[1-3]\n\n. FT synthesis is a \u201cnontrivial surface polymerization \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\nreaction \n[4]\n\n, with reaction selectivity typically described by the broad Anderson-Schulz-\n\nFlory distribution (ASF) \n[1, 5]\n\n. Consequently, the major challenge of FT reaction is to \n\ntune the reaction selectivity to specific hydrocarbon fractions. \n\nSeveral methods have been proposed for selectivity control in FT synthesis. \n\nFirst, catalytic cracking/isomerization of FT hydrocarbons can upgrade the reaction \n\nproducts to a specific fuel. Combination of FT synthesis with hydrocracking and \n\nisomerization of long chain hydrocarbons restricts the hydrocarbon distribution to a \n\nmore convenient range \n[6]\n\n. The isomerization and cracking of FT hydrocarbons would \n\nlead to iso-paraffins or diesel fuels constituted by the C10-C20 hydrocarbons. This \n\nmultistage process, however, significantly reduces the efficiency of synthetic fuel \n\nproduction.  \n\nAn alternative to that multi-stage process would be to utilize bifunctional \n\ncatalysts containing an active FT component, e.g. Co or Ru, and an acid catalyst active \n\nfor cracking and isomerization. The proximity between metal and acid sites is an \n\nimportant parameter of the bifunctional catalysts often governing reaction rate and \n\nselectivities. Recently two additional methods for hydrocarbon selectivity control were \n\nproposed, which involve making use of nanoreactors \n[7]\n\n and microemulsions \n[8]\n\n. In these \n\nmethods the carbon chain length is limited by steric and diffusion limitations. \n\nZeolites have been often suggested as promising catalysts for hydrocarbon \n\ncracking and isomerization under the conditions similar to FT synthesis \n[3, 9]\n\n. An FT \n\ncatalyst can be combined with a zeolite through several different methods: in a dual bed \n\ncatalytic reactor with FT catalyst in the first layer followed by zeolite \n[10, 11]\n\n; in hybrid \n\ncatalysts prepared by mixing of FT catalyst and zeolite \n[12-14]\n\n; in the catalysts prepared \n\nby zeolite impregnation with metal salts \n[13, 15-18]\n\n; and by composite zeolite/metal \n\ncatalysts, for example, core-shell materials \n[19, 20]\n\n. \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nA significant number of research publications have been dedicated to direct \n\nsynthesis of gasoline and middle distillates over dual bed or hybrid catalysts obtained \n\nthrough combination of supported Co catalysts and zeolites \n[10-16, 21-23]\n\n. Different types \n\nof zeolite frameworks such as ZSM-5, MCM-22, IM-5, ITQ-2, BEA, MOR, and FAU \n\nwith and without addition of noble-metal promoters have been tested and combined \n\nwith FT synthesis catalysts. Still, slow diffusion of long-chain paraffins through zeolite \n\npores, in particular on medium-pore zeolites, leads to a preferential participation of the \n\nacid sites on the zeolite external surface and lower isomerization efficiency \n[22]\n\n.  \n\nImpregnation is another method for the preparation of bi-functional Co-zeolite \n\ncatalysts for direct production of fuels from syngas \n[13, 15-18, 24-26]\n\n. Still, this method \n\npresents a major drawback that is the neutralization of the zeolite acid sites by cobalt \n\nions. Cobalt ions, introduced during impregnation, can occupy cation positions in the \n\nzeolite framework decreasing the number of acid sites available for hydrocarbon \n\nisomerization and cracking, while larger cobalt oxide particles can be detected on the \n\nouter surface of zeolite. Additionally, isolated Co cations in the zeolite framework are \n\nvery difficult to reduce to metallic cobalt. Cobalt species on the zeolite outer surface \n\nhave low dispersion and generate insufficient number of active sites for FT reaction. \n\nThis decreases the amount of active phase for FT synthesis.  \n\nThe improvement of zeolite diffusion properties through creating a hierarchical \n\nporous network has been the subject of extensive research \n[27-30]\n\n. The application of this \n\ntype of materials was proven to be beneficial for the activity and selectivity of several \n\ncatalytic reactions including long-chain paraffin isomerization and cracking combined \n\nwith FT synthesis \n[26, 29-33]\n\n. Several synthesis methodologies, classified as top-down and \n\nbottom-up have be applied to the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites. A mesoporous \n\nnetwork can be created directly by partially destroying the zeolite crystal through \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\ndesilication \n[27, 34]\n\n or dealumination \n[35, 36]\n\n. Alternatively, hierarchical zeolites can be \n\nproduced directly during the zeolite synthesis through the use of external templates that \n\nare sacrificed after zeolite synthesis, e.g. carbon structures \n[28, 37]\n\n resins \n[38]\n\n or polymers \n\n[39]\n. It is important to emphasize that cobalt is usually added to the zeolites in the second \n\nstep after hierarchization of the zeolite. \n\nThe goal of this work is to obtain in a one-pot synthesis composite hierarchical \n\nzeolites with cobalt metal particles uniformly distributed in the zeolite mesoporous \n\nstructure. This has been achieved by using cobalt impregnated carbon nanotubes \n\n(Co/CNT) as sacrificial templates during the synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite. Two different \n\ncarbon nanotubes (CNT) with outer diameters of 10-20 nm and 20-40 nm were used to \n\ninduce mesoporosity in ZSM-5. The catalysts were characterized by low-temperature N2 \n\nadsorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed \n\nreduction (TPR) and FTIR spectroscopy with adsorbed pyridine (Py). The hierarchical \n\ncobalt-zeolite samples were tested in FT synthesis and their catalytic performance in \n\nparticular relative to synthesis of iso-paraffins was compared with the Co/ZSM-5 \n\ncatalysts prepared by conventional impregnation. \n\n \n\n4.2 Experimental Section \n\nImpregnation of carbon nanotubes with cobalt \n\nPrior to the impregnation, the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were \n\ntreated with nitric acid to remove all metal contamination. Two different CNT samples \n\n(Iolitec nanomaterial, 95%) with different diameters, that is, 10-20 nm and 20-40 nm, \n\nwere used. Typically, CNTs (3 g) were pretreated in concentrated HNO3 (68%, 210 mL) \n\nfor 14 h under reflux conditions. After, the samples were filtered, washed with distilled \n\nwater until pH 7, and dried at 100 \u00b0C overnight.   \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nCobalt and platinum were introduced to CNTs by wet impregnation method \n\nusing respectively Co(NO3)2*6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma-\n\nAldrich) as precursors. Typically,  Co(NO3)2 and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution (50 mL) was \n\nused per gram of CNTs and the precursor amount was estimated to obtain a final \n\ncomposition of 20 wt.% Co and 0.1 wt.% Pt. The mixture was submitted to ultrasonic \n\ntreatment for 30 min and dried at 80 \u00b0C. The samples were calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h \n\nunder a nitrogen atmosphere. \n\nAfter the calcination, the samples were treated with H2O2 to restore the \n\nhydrophilic properties of the CNTs. Typically, 30 mL of 1:1 H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich, \n\n35%) and distilled water were added to impregnated CNTs (2.56 g), which was \n\nsonicated for 30 min and dried at 80 \u00b0C.  \n\n \n\nSynthesis of hierarchical cobalt - ZSM-5 \n\nThe ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized by using the following initial composition of \n\nthe gel: 2.7NaCl:1Al2O3:12.5TPAOH:55.8SiO2:7500H2O. Sodium chloride (0.380 g, \n\nJanssen Chimica, P.A.), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (3.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 1M in \n\nH2O), sodium aluminate (0.040 g, Sigma-Aldrich) and distilled water were mixed until \n\na clear solution was obtained. Then, Co/CNT (0.3 g) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, \n\n2.8 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were added to the solution. After, the synthesis gel was \n\naged for 1 h at room temperature under stirring. The synthesis gel was set inside a \n\nTeflon-lined autoclave (40 mL) and the zeolite crystallization performed under static \n\ncondition at 170 \u00b0C for 24 h. After cooling down, the solid was recovered by filtration \n\nand washed until neutral pH. The final solid was calcined at 600 \u00b0C for 4 h under air. \n\nThermogravimetric analysis showed complete decomposition and oxidation of cobalt-\n\ncontaining carbon nanotubes at temperatures below 400 \u00b0C. This suggests that cobalt \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nzeolite composite catalysts calcined at 600 \u00b0C in air did not contain any residual carbon \n\nspecies. \n\nFor comparison, zeolite syntheses without addition of CNTs or in the presence \n\nof CNTs, which did not contain cobalt ions, were performed. The prepared zeolites were \n\nimpregnated with cobalt and platinum precursors in the final catalysts.  \n\nTo obtain the zeolite acid form, two successive exchanges using 2 M NH4NO3 \n\naqueous solution at 80 \u00b0C for 1 h (1 g of zeolite per 50 mL of solution) were performed. \n\nThe ammonium form was converted into the protonic form by calcination at 450 \u00b0C for \n\n4 h under air.  \n\nThe synthesized samples were denoted as: CoCNT(x)/ZSM-5 for the samples \n\nsynthesized with cobalt and platinum co-impregnated CNTs (x represents the CNT \n\ndiameter used in the synthesis, that is, 10-20 or 20-40 nm); Co(x)/ ZSM-5 for the \n\nsamples synthesized with CNTs and subsequently impregnated with Co and Pt (x \n\nrepresents the CNT diameter used in the synthesis, that is, 10-20 nm or 20-40 nm). \n\nCo/ZSM-5 stands for the zeolite synthetized without addition of CNTs and impregnated \n\nwith the Co and Pt precursors.  \n\n \n\nCatalyst characterization \n\nThe samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) by using a D8 \n\nAdvance diffractometer equipped with an energy dispersive type detector and a \n\nmonochromatic CuK? radiation source. The samples were analyzed using a step of 0.02\u00b0 \n\nwith an acquisition time of 0.5 s. The average size of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) crystallites \n\nwas determined by the Scherrer equation. \n\nThe sample chemical composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) \n\non a spectrometer M4 TORNADO (Bruker). This instrument is equipped with 2 anodes: \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nrhodium X-ray tube 50 kV/600 mA (30 W) and a tungsten X-Ray tube 50 kV/700 mA \n\n(35 W). For sample characterization, the rhodium X-rays with a poly-capillary lens \n\nenabling excitation of an area of 200 ?m were used. The detector used was a Silicon-\n\nDrift-Detector Si(Li) with&lt;145 eV resolution at 100000 cps (MnK?) and cooled with a \n\nPeltier cooling (253\u00b0K). The measurement was done under vacuum (20 mbar). \n\nQuantitative analysis was performed using fundamental parameter (FP; standardless).  \n\nThe textural properties of the samples were determined by N2 physisorption on a \n\nMicromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed \n\nunder vacuum (10 \u00b5mHg) at 350 \u00b0C for 4 h. The total pore volume (TPV) was \n\ncalculated from the amount of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure P/P0 = 0.97. The \n\nsamples surface area was estimated by the BET method, while the micropore volume \n\nand external surface were calculated using the deBoer t-plot method.  \n\nThe catalyst reducibility was studied using temperature-programmed reduction \n\n(TPR) system with an Autochem II (Micrometrics) apparatus. The samples were \n\nreduced under a flow of 5% H2 in argon (50 mL min\n-1\n\n) and heated up to 800 \u00b0C at a rate \n\nof 5 \u00b0C/min. \n\nComparative characterization of the acidic OH groups (Br\u00f6nsted acid sites) and \n\nLewis acid sites in solid acids, e.g. zeolites, was carried out using transmittance FTIR \n\nmeasurements in the 6000-900 cm\n-1\n\n spectral range utilizing pyridine adsorption for \n\nmonitoring the strength and relative quantities of both Lewis and Br\u00f6nsted acid sites. \n\nFTIR transmittance measurements were performed at ~30 \u00b0C using self-supported disks \n\nof studied materials activated at 450 \u00b0C for 5 h in vacuum (with the temperature ramp of \n\n1 \no\nC/min). FTIR spectra have been collected using a Thermo iS10 spectrometer at a 4 \n\ncm\n-1\n\n resolution (0.96 cm\n-1\n\n data spacing). The spectra were analyzed and presented \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\n(including integration, differentiation and determination of peak positions) using \n\nspecialized Thermo software, Omnic. Acidic properties of the samples were evaluated \n\nusing temperature programmed desorption of pyridine (Py) monitored \n\nspectroscopically. An excess of Py was admitted into the transmittance cell at 150 \u00b0C, in \n\na stepwise manner until no changes were observed in the spectra. The saturated sample \n\nwas then evacuated for 10 min at 150 \u00b0C to remove physically adsorbed Py and the \n\nFTIR spectrum collected. In the transmittance TPD experiments, Py was removed under \n\nvacuum in a stepwise fashion at 150-450 \u00b0C, and the FTIR spectra were obtained at \n\neach temperature step, every 50 \u00b0C. The intensity of the Py-L and Py-H\n+\n peaks at ~ \n\n1455 and 1545 cm\n-1 \n\nwas measured as a function of temperature, and the resulting plots \n\nused to compare the effective acidity of the samples. \n\nThe TEM observations of the samples were obtained by using a Tecnai \n\ninstrument equipped with a LaB6 crystal operated at 200 kV. Before the analysis, the \n\nsamples were dispersed by ultrasound in ethanol for 5 min, and a drop of the suspension \n\nwas deposited onto a carbon membrane on a 300 mesh copper grid. The STEM-\n\nHAADF tomographic analysis was carried out on a Jeol 2100F (field emission gun) \n\nmicroscope operating at 200 kV by using a spot size of 1.1 \u00c5 with a current density of \n\n0.5 pA \u00c5\n-1\n\n. \n\n \n\nCatalytic tests \n\nThe catalytic performance of the samples was tested in FT synthesis. The \n\nexperiments were performed in a milli-fixed bed reactor. All the details of the catalytic \n\ntest relevant to mass and heat transfers are given in our earlier publication [53]. No \n\nsignificant (>0.5 bar) pressure drop and temperature gradient are observed under the \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nreaction conditions. Prior to testing, the samples were reduced in situ in pure H2 gas \n\nflow (3 mL min\n-1\n\n) at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 \u00b0C/min. Then, the reactor \n\nwas cooled down to room temperature, the flow switched to syngas (H2/CO = 2) and the \n\npressure adjusted to 20 bar. Nitrogen (5% of the CO flow) was used as internal \n\nstandard. The flow was adjusted to obtain a GHSV of 20-70 L/gCo.h. After achieving the \n\ndesired pressure, the temperature was progressively increased to the reaction \n\ntemperature, i.e. 250 \u00b0C, at a rate of 3 \u00b0C/min. The reaction was conducted at 250 \u00b0C in \n\norder to create in addition to FT synthesis favorable conditions for secondary reactions \n\nsuch as olefin cracking and isomerization. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was \n\nexpressed in cm\n3\n gcat\n\n-1\n h\n\n-1\n. The units correspond to the volume of syngas, which passed \n\nthrough 1 g of catalyst per hour. The gaseous reaction products, i.e. up to the C5 \n\nhydrocarbons were analyzed online using gas-chromatography (GC\u00d7FID/TCD, Varian, \n\nCP-3800). The liquid products were condensed under pressure and analyzed ex situ \n\nusing a Shimadzu 2010-Plus-AF gas-chromatograph.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Results and Discussion \n\nCatalyst structure \n\nThe XRD patterns of the synthesized samples are displayed in Figure 4-1. All \n\nsamples present characteristic peaks of MFI zeolite. The presence of CNTs during \n\nhydrothermal treatment does not affect to any noticeable degree the intensity of the \n\nXRD peaks. The introduction of cobalt by impregnation or with CNTs during the \n\nzeolite synthesis led to an overall reduction of the intensity of the zeolite characteristic \n\npeaks. This was attributed to the effect of \u201cdilution\u201d and lower concentration of MFI \n\nphase in these samples. The Co3O4 phase was detected using a characteristic peak at 2 ? \n\nequal to 36.8\u00b0in all samples containing cobalt. The particle size of Co3O4 calculated \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nusing the Scherrer equation (Table 4-1) was in all cases between 27 and 44 nm, \n\nindicating that a large fraction of cobalt is located either in the mesopores or on the \n\nzeolite external surface. Interestingly, smaller diameter CNTs (10-20 nm) during zeolite \n\ncrystallization led to the formation of smaller Co3O4 particles, i.e. around 30 nm, when \n\ncompared with the synthesis without CNTs or using larger diameter CNTs (20-40 nm).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4-1 XRD patterns of cobalt ZSM-5 nanocomposites. \n\n \n\nTable 4-1 Catalyst textural characterization. \n\nSample \n\nN2 adsorption \nCo content \n\n(wt %) \n\n  \n\nCo3O4 \n\nParticle size* \n(nm) \n\n  \n\nSBET Vtot Vmic Vmeso \n\n(m\n2\ng\n\n-1\n) (cm3g-1) (cm3g-1) (m2g-1) \n\nZSM-5 425 0.19 0.13 0.06 - - \n\nCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 434 0.21 0.12 0.09 - - \n\nCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 418 0.21 0.10 0.11 - - \n\nCo/ZSM-5 372 0.17 0.11 0.06 15.6 44 \n\nCo(10-20)/ZSM-5 360 0.18 0.10 0.08 13.2 27 \n\nCo(20-40)/ZSM-5 276 0.13 0.08 0.05 12.7 40 \n\nCoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 435 0.32 0.09 0.23 7.8 29 \n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\n2 ?\n\nZSM-5\n\nCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nCo/ZSM-5\n\nCoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nCo(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nCo(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nCo3O4ZSM-5 ZSM-5\n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 395 0.25 0.09 0.16 9.4 42 \n\n \n\nThe catalyst textural properties are listed in Table 4-1. The nitrogen adsorption \n\ndesorption isotherms are displayed in Figure S4 (Supporting information, SI). The \n\nintroduction of CNTs without cobalt in the zeolite synthesis gel did not affect to any \n\ngreater extent the zeolite overall surface area. However, the catalyst porosity undergoes \n\nsignificant changes. The mesoporous volume of the zeolites prepared using the 10-\n\n20 nm and 20-40 nm diameter CNTs increased by 50% and 80%, respectively. This \n\nvariation is possibly caused by creating mesoporosity via removal of the CNTs \n\nincorporated inside the zeolite crystals during crystallization \n[28]\n\n.  \n\nAfter cobalt impregnation, a significant decrease in the sample surface area and \n\npore volume was observed. This decrease was attributed to the presence of Co3O4 which \n\ncan result in a partial plugging of the zeolite pores and \u201cdilution\u201d effect. In all cases, the \n\nimpregnation with cobalt nitrate also caused a decrease in the zeolite microporous \n\nvolume. This suggests that at least a part of cobalt is located inside the zeolite \n\nframework. The mesoporous volume was however slightly higher in the samples \n\nsynthetized in the presence of CNTs (without cobalt). This seems to confirm partial \n\nincorporation of CNTs into zeolites during their synthesis and subsequent generation of \n\nmesoporosity during the CNT combustion.  \n\nThe samples synthesized with Co/CNT as templates displayed surface area and \n\nmicroporous volume similar to the pure zeolite (Table 4-1), while the mesoporous \n\nvolume was significantly increased. In comparison to the ZSM-5 samples synthesized \n\nwith pristine CNTs, the CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 mesoporous \n\nvolume was, respectively, 185% and 220% higher than that of Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 \n\nand Co(20- 40)/ZSM- 5. \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nThe impact of the CNTs on the zeolite morphology was investigated by TEM \n\n(Figure 4-2). The zeolite crystallization in the presence of CNTs led to the formation of \n\nlarge pores in the zeolite crystals (Figure 4-2A). These pores were formed after \n\ncalcination when the CNTs were removed from the zeolite. The zeolite phase clearly \n\ndisplayed imprinting coming from CNTs, which were partially encapsulated inside the \n\nzeolite crystals during germination \n[26]\n\n. The presence of these regularly shaped pores \n\nwas not observed on zeolites crystallized in the presence of cobalt impregnated CNT \n\n(Figure 4-2B). In the presence of Co/CNT, the formed zeolite crystals took a less \n\nregular shape, in agreement with the higher mesopore volumes observed for calcined \n\nCoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 (Table 4-1). Schematically the zeolite \n\nsynthesis process in the presence of Co/CNT is shown in Figure 4-3. Figure 4-2C and \n\nFigure 4-2D show the formation of a uniform layered material. Importantly, these \n\nlayered structures are only observed when cobalt was present in CNT added to the \n\nzeolite synthesis mixture. Indeed, the zeolite morphology replicates that of carbon \n\nnanotubes containing cobalt nanoparticles. \n\n \n\nFigure 4-2 TEM images of Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 (A), CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5(B), CoCNT(10-\n\n20)/ZSM-5 high magnification(C) and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 high magnification. \n\n \n\nIn addition, Figure 4-2C and Figure 4-2D display a large number of small Co3O4 \n\nparticles with a diameter between 1 and 5 nm as well as larger particles, i.e. 30-50 nm. \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nThis suggests that the zeolite contains two types of cobalt particles: smaller cobalt \n\nparticles of 1-5 nm are located in the zeolite meso- and micropores, while larger cobalt \n\nparticles of 30-50 nm are situated in the zeolite mesopores and on the outer surface. \n\nNote that only large Co3O4 crystallites can be detected in the zeolites by XRD, while it \n\nis impossible to detect by XRD cobalt oxide particles smaller than 5 nm.  \n\nTo confirm uniform distribution of cobalt nanoparticles in the zeolite mesopores, \n\nwe conducted additional experiments using the STEM-HAADF electron tomography. \n\nThe typical slices (xy) and (xz) extracted from the 3D volume calculated by tomography \n\nof the sample CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 prepared using Co/CNT(20-40) as sacrificial template \n\n(Figure 4-4) show the presence of cobalt nanoparticles inside the mesoporous structure \n\nof zeolite.  \n\nThus, the electron microscopy results are clearly indicative of the important role \n\nof cobalt located on CNTs for directing zeolite synthesis. Cobalt species probably act as \n\nzeolite nucleation sites for designing mesoporous zeolites with the CNT-type \n\nmorphology (Figure 4-3). \n\n \n\nFigure 4-3 Synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite using Co/CNT as sacrificial templates. \n\nResulting zeolites replicate carbon nanotube morphology. \n\n \n\nThe TPR profiles of the catalysts are shown in Figure 4-5. The reduction profiles \n\nof the impregnated samples were consistent with the two-step Co3O4 reduction to \n\nmetallic Co. Co3O4 is first reduced to CoO which is then reduced to metallic Co, thus \n\nleading to the formation of two H2 consumption peaks \n[13, 40]\n\n. In the samples prepared by \n\nimpregnation, i.e. Co/ZSM-5, Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 and Co(20-40)/ZSM-5, the characteristic \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nCo3O4 reduction peaks overlap leading to a broad peak with a \u201clow temperature\u201d \n\nshoulder corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO. \n\n \n\nFigure 4-4 Results of STEM-HAADF electron tomography analysis of CoCNT(20-\n\n40)ZSM-5 catalyst (3D volume and typical slices showing clearly the presence of cobalt \n\nnanoparticles inside the zeolite structure). \n\n \n\nNo peaks at the temperatures higher than 400 \u00b0C were observed indicating the \n\nabsence of isolated exchanged cobalt ions or barely reducible cobalt silicates. \n\nInterestingly, the hydrogen consumption profiles were different in the samples \n\nsynthesized through the germination of zeolite in the presence of Co impregnated CNT. \n\nThe broad TPR peak which occurred at temperatures below 400 \u00b0C, can be attributed to \n\nthe reduction of Co3O4 crystallites to CoO and then to metallic Co \n[41, 42]\n\n. The second \n\nhydrogen consumption peak, observed at 700-730 \u00b0C, suggests the presence of a more \n\nrefractory cobalt phase. \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-5 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of the catalysts. \n\nThe formation of amorphous cobalt silicates or aluminates is a possible \n\nexplanation. Additionally, incorporation of cobalt in the framework structure of the MFI \n\nzeolite cannot be completely discarded. Indeed, several authors have reported \n\nincorporation of transition metals, including cobalt, into zeolite framework when this \n\nmetal was present during hydrothermal synthesis \n[43-46]\n\n. The cobalt reducibility and \n\nacidity data evaluated from pyridine adsorption and FTIR spectroscopy data are given in \n\nTable 4-2. \n\nTable 4-2 Catalyst acidity and cobalt reducibility. \n\nSample \nSiO2/ \n\nAl2O3\na\n \n\nExtent of \n\ncobalt \n\nreduction\nb\n \n\n(%) \n\nTotal acidity\nc\n \n\nFraction of strong \n\nacidity\nd\n \n\nBr\u00f6nsted \n\n(\u00b5molg\n-1\n\n) \n\nLewis \n\n(\u00b5molg\n-1\n\n) \n\nB\u00f6nsted \n\n \n\nLewis \n\n \n\nCo/ZSM-5 24 82 160 530 0.688 0.708 \n\nCo(10-20)/ZSM-5 25 69 150 520 0.733 0.769 \n\nCo(20-40)/ZSM-5 22 58 195 560 0.769 0.768 \n\nCoCNT(10-20)/ ZSM-5 20 18 250 180 0.800 0.667 \n\nCoCNT(20-40) /ZSM-5 21 7 295 130 0.847 0.846 \n\na\nbulk.

Significant changes in \n\nacid properties were observed between the impregnated samples and the ones when the \n\nCo was present during hydrothermal treatment. All the samples synthesized using cobalt \n\nnitrate impregnation of the zeolite displayed higher concentration of Lewis acid sites. \n\nUnsaturated sites in cobalt oxide particles are known to be responsible for the creation \n\nof Lewis acidity \n[47]\n\n. Therefore, higher concentration of Lewis acid sites in the \n\nimpregnated samples could be related to the higher loading of cobalt oxide in these \n\ncatalysts as shown by TPR (Figure 4-5). Much lower concentration of Co3O4 (18% and \n\n7% respectively) was detected by TPR in CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-\n\n5. These samples showed lower concentration of Lewis acid sites. Note also that the \n\nsamples synthesized through impregnation showed lower concentration of Br\u00f6nsted \n\nacid sites in comparison with the catalysts synthesized in the presence of Co/CNT. The \n\nsynthesis of the zeolite directly in the presence of Co/CNT enables higher total Br\u00f6nsted \n\nacid site concentration. The variation of IR intensity of bands attributed to Py \n\nadsorption on Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid sites is shown in Figure S2 (SI). The zeolites \n\nsynthetized using Co/CNT show a higher effective strength of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites, \n\ncompared to the samples prepared by impregnation, while the impregnated samples \n\nhave a much higher concentration of stronger Lewis acid sites (Table 4-2). \n\n \n\nCatalytic performance in FT synthesis \n\nThe results of the FT catalytic evaluation of the materials are shown in Table \n\n4-3, Figure 4-6 and Figure S3, SI. FT reaction rate varies between 131 and \n\n371 mmolCO/h.gCo. The catalytic performance of cobalt zeolite catalysts was tested for \n\nat least 30 h. No noticeable evolution of catalytic performance was observed under these \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nconditions. The samples were organized with respect to their activity in the following \n\norder: Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 >CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5>Co(20-40)/ZSM-5>Co/ZSM-5>CoCNT(20-\n\n40)/ZSM-5. The catalytic performance of cobalt catalysts depends on the density of \n\ncobalt metallic active sites. Cobalt reducibility is therefore an important parameter.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4-3 Activity and selectivity of the catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis \n\nreaction (P=2 MPa, GHSV=20-70 L/h gCo, T=250 \u00b0C, H2/CO=2). \n\nCatalyst \n\nFT reaction rate \n\n(mmolCO/h.gCo)* \n\nConversion \n\n(%) \n\n Selectivity  \n\nCH4 C2-C4 \n\nC2-C4 \n\n(olefin) \n\nC2-C4 \n\n(paraffin) \n\nC2-C4 \n\n(P/O) \n\nC5\n+\n\n \n\nCo/ZSM-5 244 39 32.8 19.0 2.7 16.3 6.0 48.1 \n\nCo(10-20)/ZSM -5 371 28 28.9 18.4 2.0 16.4 8.2 52.7 \n\nCo(20-40)/ZSM-5 204 29 37.1 29.8 1.5 28.3 18.9 33.1 \n\nCoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 352 (1961)\n#\n 42 15.9 13.8 2.8 11.0 3.9 73.1 \n\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 131 (1893)\n#\n 28 12.6 13.2 3.0 10.2 3.4 74.2 \n\n*time at 24 h. \n#\n In brackets: activity on the reducible cobalt basis. \n\n \n\nWhereas the TPR profiles of the samples prepared by impregnation suggest the \n\npresence of cobalt species reducible at temperatures lower than 450 \u00b0C, the TPR \n\nprofiles (Figure 4-5) of the CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 samples \n\nsynthetized using Co/CNT templates show that only a small portion of the cobalt is \n\nreducible at 400 \u00b0C. Consequently, the samples prepared by addition of Co/CNT during \n\nthe zeolite synthesis contain a higher fraction of cobalt silicate or aluminates, which are \n\nnot active for the reaction. Interestingly, when comparing the activity of the catalysts on \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nthe basis of reducible cobalt (Table 4-3), both CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-\n\n40)/ZSM-5 displayed a 5 to 10 times higher FT rate compared to the impregnated \n\nsamples. \n\nThe higher activity per reducible cobalt observed on the samples obtained by \n\nzeolite germination on Co/CNT can be linked to their enhanced mesoporous structure. \n\nCobalt CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 display much higher mesoporous \n\nvolume. During the catalyst preparation, cobalt metal nanoparticles introduced using the \n\nCo/CNT sacrificial templates are distributed more uniformly within the zeolite \n\nmesopores than in the catalysts prepared by impregnation. In addition, catalyst \n\nmesoporosity enhanced in CoCNT/ZSM-5 compared to other cobalt zeolite catalysts \n\nfacilitates diffusion of the reagents and intermediates and removal of the reaction \n\nproducts. The cobalt metal nanoparticles size is also known to be an important factor for \n\nthe FT synthesis performance \n[48]\n\n. The average size of cobalt oxide crystallites \n\ncalculated from XRD in all samples was between 27 and 40 nm. In contrast to the \n\nsamples prepared by impregnation, the TEM images of CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and \n\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 (Figure 4-2 and Figure 4-4) clearly show the presence of Co3O4 \n\nparticles with the size between 1 and 5 nm. Some of these nanoparticles are probably \n\nlocated in the zeolite micropores.  \n\nTable 4-3 also shows hydrocarbon selectivities observed in FT synthesis on \n\ncobalt\u2013zeolite catalysts for CO conversions in the range of 28 and 42%. Previous \n\nreports \n[3, 13, 16]\n\n suggest very small impact of variation of conversion between 30 and \n\n40% on the reaction selectivity.  The methane selectivity varies between 13 and 37%. \n\nThe samples synthesized by impregnation, i.e. Co/ZSM-5, Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 and Co(20-\n\n40)/ZSM-5, display much higher selectivity towards methane formation when compared \n\nto CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5. Notably, methane selectivity was \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nbetween 1.8 and 2.9 times lower when Co/CNT was present during zeolite synthesis. \n\nSimilarly, the C2-C4 hydrocarbon selectivity was also higher in the samples obtained by \n\ncobalt impregnation, in particular on Co(20-40)/ZSM-5. Metal particle sizes and their \n\nlocation in the zeolite can explain the selectivity towards short carbon-chain products \n\nand methane observed on the impregnated samples. Indeed, during the impregnation, \n\ncobalt can diffuse inside the zeolite framework generating small particles, in addition to \n\nthe larger metal particles located on the zeolite external surface. The diffusion \n\nlimitations and smaller metal particles inside the zeolite framework can result in higher \n\nmethane and lower carbon-chain products selectivities \n[7]\n\n. Lower methane selectivity \n\nobserved on the CoCNT/ZSM-5 samples could be also due to partial dissolution of \n\nextremely small cobalt nanoparticles during zeolite germination around these cobalt \n\nspecies. The occurrence of higher diffusion limitations in the impregnated samples is \n\nalso consistent with the higher paraffin to olefin ratio (Table 4-3) observed for the \n\nimpregnated samples. Higher paraffin yields are linked to the higher rate of olefin \n\nsecondary hydrogenation, which are favored when diffusion limitations and olefin \n\nresidence time in the zeolite pores are more significant.  \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4-6 Molar distribution of liquid products by carbon number. IsomerTotal \n\nrepresents the total amount of isomerized products in the gas fraction. ? represents the \n\nchain growth coefficient for the ASF distribution. \n\n \n\nThe liquid product distribution is shown in Figure 4-6, with the respective n-\n\nparaffin and isomer product selectivity. Independently of the synthesis procedure, none \n\nof the zeolite based catalysts yielded products with more than 25 carbon atoms. Thus, it \n\nis possible to assert that the zeolite support is responsible for the reduction of the carbon \n\nchain of the FT products. Note that cobalt catalyst on non-acidic supports at similar \n\nreaction conditions show formation of long-chain hydrocarbons with up to 50 carbon \n\natoms \n[13]\n\n. This phenomenon is reflected by the chain growth probability (?) in the \n\nAnderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. Figure S3, SI clearly shows modification of the \n\nAnderson-Schulz-Flory plot for CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 which was synthetized using \n\nCo/CNT as sacrificial templates compared to other catalysts. Under similar reaction \n\nconditions and on a non-acidic support, e.g. SiO2, ? is commonly around 0.85 for \n\ncobalt-based catalysts \n[13]\n\n, whereas for the samples in this study the chain growth \n\nprobability was between 0.58 and 0.68.  \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nThe catalytic data suggest strong influence of the zeolite on both isomerization \n\nand cracking. On the one hand, the reaction products over cobalt zeolite composites \n\ncontained significant amounts of isomers because of olefin isomerization on the zeolite \n\nBr\u00f6nsted acid sites (Figure 4-5). On other hand, the carbon chain length over the cobalt \n\nzeolite catalysts was much shorter than on silica-supported counterparts. The reduction \n\nof the carbon chain growth when using zeolite supports for the FT synthesis is generally \n\nattributed to the occurrence of cracking reactions over Br\u00f6nsted acid sites. The long-\n\nchain hydrocarbons resulting from the FT synthesis undergo cracking and isomerization \n\non the zeolite acid sites leading to the formation of the shorter branched hydrocarbons. \n\nIndeed, the presence of isomerized hydrocarbons in the wax was observed for all \n\ncatalysts. The proportion between isomerized products and linear paraffins was largely \n\ninfluenced by the catalyst synthesis procedures. Among the impregnated samples, the \n\nselectivity towards isomerization products was higher on Co/ZSM-5 followed by Co(10-\n\n20)/ZSM-5 and Co(20-40)/ZSM-5, respectively with isomer fractions of 57%, 48%, and \n\n35%. Interestingly, CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 displayed the highest selectivity towards \n\nisomerization products, i.e. fraction of branched isomers of 63%. It is important to \n\nmention that hydrocarbons with a higher isomerization degree are more likely to lead to \n\nthe formation of tertiary carbocations, which however, can undergo ?-scission [49]. \n\nMoreover, because of longer residence time in the zeolite micropores, the long chain \n\nhydrocarbons are more likely to undergo cracking \n[50]\n\n. Therefore, lower isomerization \n\nselectivity observed on the impregnated samples might be linked to a higher cracking \n\nrate of the long chain hydrocarbons. The higher selectivity to the C2-C4 hydrocarbons, \n\nand consequent lower C5\n+\n hydrocarbon yield, observed for the impregnated samples \n\ncould be due to the cracking of larger molecules.  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of primary and secondary cracking reactions in zeolite materials \n\nis often attributed to diffusion limitations \n[51]\n\n. Indeed, a longer residence time of the \n\nmolecules in the vicinity of acid sites increases the probability of hydrocarbons to \n\nundergo cracking while shorter residence time of long chain hydrocarbons in proximity \n\nof zeolite acid sites would favor isomerization. The porosity of the impregnated sample \n\nis mostly constituted by micropores, while CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-\n\n5 have significant mesoporous volume created by the CNT sacrificial templates. The \n\ndiffusion of higher hydrocarbons is therefore enhanced in the CoCNT/ZSM-5 catalysts, \n\nwhich reduces their residence time inside the zeolite pores and probability of cracking. \n\nThis suggestion is consistent with higher selectivity to longer carbon chain \n\nhydrocarbons observed on CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 (Table 4-3). \n\nAdditionally, the higher cracking reaction rate on the impregnated samples would \n\nexplain the lower isomerization selectivity on the impregnated catalysts, since the \n\ncracking rate of branched hydrocarbons is several orders of magnitude higher \n[52]\n\n than \n\nfor linear conterparts. On CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5,  the molecules \n\nproduced by FT synthesis can diffuse more easily, owing  to the higher mesoporous \n\nvolume of the samples. Therefore, the cracking reactions rates lessened due to the faster \n\ndiffusion and removal of the isomerized products. This improves isomerization \n\nselectivity and selectivity toward long-chain hydrocarbons. \n\nThe synthesis of zeolite in the presence of cobalt impregnated CNTs avoids the \n\nzeolite pore plugging during cobalt impregnation while generating a complementary \n\nmesoporous structure in the zeolite support. Consequently, the diffusion is improved \n\nenabling a reduction in the methane and C2-C4 hydrocarbon selectivities. Additionally, \n\nthe liquid products are mainly composed of hydrocarbons up to C20 with a higher degree \n\nof isomerization. Therefore, the catalysts on the basis of mesoporous zeolites \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nsynthesized using carbon nanotubes with cobalt nanoparticles as sacrificial templates \n\nare more suitable for the direct production of fuels from syngas than conventional cobalt \n\nzeolite supported catalysts prepared by impregnation. \n\n4.4 Conclusion \n\nThe use of cobalt impregnated CNTs as sacrificial template enables direct \n\nsynthesis of cobalt/ZSM-5 mesoporous composite catalysts. The synthesized catalyst \n\nhad significantly higher mesoporous volume when the synthesis was performed in the \n\npresence of Co/CNT than pristine CNTs. The morphology was also strongly affected by \n\nthe zeolite synthesis method. The samples prepared during zeolite synthesis using the \n\nCo/CNT sacrificial templates showed clearly expressed layered structure. This indicates \n\nthat the cobalt had an impact on the zeolite germination process. At the same time, the \n\nfinal samples had similar Si/Al ratio. The catalysts prepared by impregnated exhibited \n\nhigher concentration of Lewis acid sites, whereas the catalysts prepared using Co/CNT \n\nshowed higher amount of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites. A significant amount of cobalt silicates \n\nwas observed when cobalt was present during the zeolite synthesis. \n\nThe catalytic performance in FT synthesis was significantly affected by the \n\ncatalyst synthesis procedure. The FT reaction rate normalized by reducible cobalt was \n\n5-10 times higher over the catalysts prepared using Co/CNT as sacrificial template. The \n\nhigher mesoporous volume of the samples synthesized using Co/CNT during zeolite \n\ngermination allows a faster diffusion of products and reagents, leading to longer chain \n\nproducts and a reduction of the cracking reactions while improving the selectivity to \n\nbranched hydrocarbons. \n\nThe originality and major advantage of the developed method are relevant to \n\nsimultaneous creation of zeolite mesoporous structure and introduction of cobalt \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\nnanoparticles within zeolite crystallites. Different to the techniques of post-synthesis \n\nintroduction of cobalt, the method developed in this paper leads to a uniform \n\ndistribution of cobalt nanoparticles within the zeolite mesoporous structure, enhanced \n\ndiffusion and catalytic performance in FT reaction. \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n[1] A.Y.

Small zeolite pore size and non-uniform distribution of the metal component \n\nwithin the zeolite structure heavily reduce the efficiency of these catalysts. In this work, \n\nwe propose a new strategy for the design of hierarchical zeolites with specific shape, \n\nenhanced mesoporosity and uniform distribution of highly dispersed metals such as \n\ncobalt, nickel, and magnesium in the zeolite crystals. The strategy involves using metal \n\ncarbon nanotubes as structure directing agents. Multiple roles of the metal carbon \n\nnanotubes in the zeolite synthesis are uncovered. First, they serve as a replica to create \n\nzeolite with specific fibrous shape. Second, they fulfill the role of a mesoporogen and \n\nincrease 3-5 times the zeolite secondary porosity. Finally, they operate a vehicle to \n\nuniformly introduce the metal functions inside the mesoporous zeolites.  Importantly, \n\nthe presence of metals in carbon nanotubes is essential for the enhancement of \n\nmesoporosity. The catalysts prepared using metal carbon nanotube templates have \n\nshown enhanced catalytic performance in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation of \n\naromatics and anisole acylation.  \n\nKeywords: hierarchical zeolite; hard template; replicas; catalyst; promotion; \n\nmetal dispersion; acidity \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nZeolites are microporous crystalline solids with a regular pore system, which \n\nhave found numerous applications in industrial processes such as oil refining, organic \n\nsynthesis, adsorption and separation.  The zeolite crystal structure determines the size \n\nand geometry of the micropores. They are very specific for a given type of the zeolite \n[1]\n\n \n\nand often are comparable with the size of reacting molecules. Smaller and uniform \n\npores lead to stronger interaction between the zeolite and reacting molecules and thus, \n\nintroduce geometric, electronic confinement and shape selectivity phenomena for a \n\ncatalytic reaction involving bulky molecules \n[2]\n\n. Zeolites can be tailored to specific \n\ncatalytic applications by controlling Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acidity as well as by \n\nintroducing new catalytic functions, including metal cations, clusters, metal oxides, \n\norganic complexes and enzymes. \n\nZeolites in their hydrogen form are considered as acid catalysts, while metal-\n\ncontaining zeolites are considered as bifunctional catalysts that exhibit complex \n\nbehavior. The concentrations and intrinsic activity of the metal and acid sites, and in \n\nparticular, their localization within the zeolite structure are of utmost importance for the \n\ncatalyst activity, selectivity and stability \n[3-5]\n\n. Ion exchange, impregnation, or \n\nintroduction of a metal precursor to the zeolite synthesis gel have been often used for \n\nsynthesis of metal-zeolite composites. In the metal-zeolite composites, metal can be \n\npresent either in the form of isolated cations in the cationic sites, or in the form of \n\ntetrahedrally coordinated cations isomorphously substituting silicon or aluminum atoms \n\nin the zeolite framework, or finally, as small metal or oxide nanoparticles localized \n\nwithin the zeolite micro- or mesopores. The distribution of metal component with the \n\nzeolite is of paramount importance for the resulting catalytic performance. The distance \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nbetween metal nanoparticles and acid sites, \u201csite intimacy\u201d \n[6]\n\n, diffusional limitations for \n\nthe intermediates during their transport from one site to another \n[7-10]\n\n strongly affect the \n\nperformance of many catalytic reactions \n\nThe very small pore size of zeolites (~1 nm) imposes diffusional limitations for \n\nmany catalytic reactions, in particular for those, involving bulky molecules. In order to \n\novercome these, numerous efforts have made to synthesize nano-sized zeolite \n\ncrystals \n[11]\n\n, extra-large pore zeolites \n[12]\n\n, or mesoporous zeolites \n[13, 14]\n\n, the latter are \n\noften referred as hierarchical zeolites. The hierarchical zeolites contain, in addition to \n\nthe well-defined micropore system, mesopores with the diameters in the range of 2-\n\n50 nm \n[15, 16]\n\n. Different to zeolite micropores, the size, shape and orientation of these \n\nmesopores are not directly related to the zeolite crystalline structure. The methods used \n\nfor the preparation of hierarchical zeolites could be summarized into two main groups. \n\n(i) Bottom-up methods, where sacrificial templates of desired size and dimensions are \n\nincorporated into zeolite crystals during the crystallization step. These templates are \n\nthen eliminated by combustion or extraction. (ii) Top-down methods, including post-\n\nsynthesis chemical treatment of zeolite crystals leading to the extraction of aluminum \n\nand silicon atoms and partial dissolution of the zeolite framework. Note that it is usually \n\nmuch more difficult to maintain zeolites with good crystallinity and to generate uniform \n\nmesopores using top-down methods such as steam treatment, acid and alkaline leaching \n\n[17]\n compared to the bottom-up strategies. \n\nBoth hard \n[18, 19]\n\n and soft templates \n[20, 21]\n\n have been utilized to synthetize \n\nhierarchical zeolites using the bottom up approach. The hard templates usually include \n\ncarbon nanoparticles, nanotubes and polymer beads, while various cationic surfactants, \n\norganosilane, cationic polymer, and ionic liquids \n[22, 23]\n\n are considered as soft secondary \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\ntemplates. Both hard and soft templates could be removed by calcination. Among the \n\nhard templates, carbon nanotubes (CNT) have attracted particular attention in the \n\nliterature. CNT are very versatile materials \n[24, 25]\n\n as their properties are strongly affected \n\nby the presence of hydrophobic or hydrophilic functional groups, metals, oxide and \n\nother dopants. As a result, the properties of hierarchical zeolites prepared using CNT as \n\nsecondary templates are strongly affected by the features of CNT and zeolite synthesis \n\nconditions. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been performed to evaluate \n\nthe effect of different metals present in CNT on the zeolite crystallization and \n\nmesoporosity.  \n\nIn this chapter, metal containing CNT (Me-CNT) were applied as secondary \n\ntemplates for synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites. We uncovered at least three \n\nroles of Me-CNT in the zeolite synthesis. First, they strongly affect the shape of the \n\nsynthesized zeolites, which seem to be replicas of CNT and show distinct fibrous \n\ntexture. Second, the Me-CNT plays a role of mesoporogen and strongly enhance the \n\nzeolite mesoporous volume. Finally, zeolite synthesis in the presence of Me-CNT offers \n\nthe opportunity to simultaneously introduce new catalytic functions leading to \n\nbifunctional metal-zeolite catalysts. The introduced metals are then uniformly \n\ndistributed within the zeolite crystals. The presence of metal species in CNT is essential \n\nto obtain the observed phenomena. Note that only very limited impact on zeolite porous \n\nstructure was observed by using metal-free CNT as secondary hard templates. The \n\nmetal zeolite composites prepared using metal-CNT templates exhibited improved \n\ncatalytic performance in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation of aromatics and \n\nanisole acylation with hexanoic acid. \n\n \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\n5.2 Experimental \n\nCNT and their impregnation with metal precursors \n\nTwo multi-wall CNT samples (Iolitec nanomaterial, 95%) with different \n\ndiameters, i.e. 10-20 nm and 20-40 nm, were used. The CNT were pretreated with nitric \n\nacid to remove all metal contaminations. This treatment also converted CNT into their \n\nhydrophilic forms. Typically, 3 g of CNT were pretreated in 210 mL of concentrated \n\nHNO3 (68%) for 14 h under reflux. Next, the samples were filtered, washed with \n\ndistilled water until pH = 7 and dried at 100 \u00baC overnight.  \n\nMetals were added to CNT via the wet impregnation method using Co(NO3)2 \n\n6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich), Mg(NO3)2 6H2O (Sigma-\n\nAldrich) and Ni(NO3)2 6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) as precursors. Co-impregnation with \n\nplatinum was solely used for the preparation of cobalt catalysts. Typically, the precursor \n\namount for impregnation was calculated to obtain 20 wt.% of the metal in the final \n\ncatalyst. The mixture was subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 30 min and dried at \n\n80 \u00b0C. The samples were calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 4 h under nitrogen atmosphere. \n\nAfter calcination in nitrogen, the hydrophilic properties of CNT were partially \n\nlost. In order to restore the CNT hydrophilicity, the samples were treated with H2O2. \n\nTypically, 30 mL of 1:1 H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 35%) and distilled water mixture were \n\nadded to 2.56 g of impregnated CNT, sonicated for 30 min and dried at 80 \u00b0C. The \n\nmetal supported CNT catalysts are denoted as Metal/CNT(x) (where Metal=Co, Ni or \n\nMg) and x is the CNT diameter in nm.  \n\n \n\nSynthesis of hierarchical metal-ZSM-5 zeolites \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\nThe ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized by using a synthesis gel with the initial \n\ncomposition of 2.7NaCl:1Al2O3:12.5TPAOH:55.8SiO2:7500H2O. The synthesis of the \n\nzeolite was carried out by mixing sodium chloride (0.380 g, Janssen Chimica, P.A.), \n\ntetrapropylammonium hydroxide (3.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 1 M in H2O), sodium \n\naluminate (0.040 g, Sigma-Aldrich) and distilled water until a clear solution was \n\nobtained. Metal/CNT (0.24 g) and tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS, 2.8 g, Sigma-Aldrich, \n\n99%) were added to the previous solution. Then, the synthesis gel was aged for 1 h at \n\nroom temperature under stirring. The synthesis gel was put inside a Teflon-lined \n\nautoclave (40 mL). The zeolite crystallization was performed under static condition at \n\n170 \u00b0C for 24 h. After cooling down, the solid was recovered by filtration and washed \n\nuntil pH=7 was achieved. The final solid was calcined at 600 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. Further \n\ndetails relevant to the introduction of cobalt with CNT into ZSM-5 zeolite are available \n\nelsewhere \n[26]\n\n. \n\nFor comparison, the zeolite syntheses using pure CNT were performed under the \n\nsame conditions using a similar gel composition. The resulting zeolites were then \n\nimpregnated using incipient wetness method with cobalt, nickel and magnesium nitrates \n\nas precursors.  \n\nIn order to obtain the zeolite acid form, two successive exchanges using 2 M \n\nNH4NO3 aqueous solution at 80 \u00b0C for 1 h (1 g of zeolite per 50 mL of solution) were \n\nperformed. The ammonium forms were converted into the protonic forms by calcination \n\nat 450 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. The synthesized samples were denoted as: MetalCNT(x)/ZSM-5 \n\n(where Metal= Co, Ni or Mg) for the samples synthesized using metal impregnated \n\nCNT (x represents the CNT diameter used in the synthesis, i.e. 10-20 or 20-40 nm) and \n\nCTN(x)/ZSM-5 for the samples synthesized with pure CNT as secondary templates. \n\nMetal/ZSM-5 stands for the zeolite synthetized without any secondary template and \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\nconventionally impregnated after its synthesis with a metal nitrate followed by the \n\nnitrate decomposition via calcination in air at 500 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCatalyst characterization \n\nThe textural properties of the samples were determined by N2 physisorption on a \n\nMicromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Prior to the analysis, the samples were degassed \n\nunder vacuum (10 \u00b5mHg) at 350 \u00b0C for 4 h. The total pore volume (TPV) was \n\ncalculated from the amount of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure P/P0 = 0.97. The \n\nsample surface area was estimated by the BET method, while the micropore volume \n\nwas calculated using the deBoer t-plot method.  \n\nThe samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a D8 advance \n\ndiffractometer equipped with an energy dispersive type detector and a monochromatic \n\nCuK? radiation source. The samples were analyzed using a step of 0.02\u00b0 with an \n\nacquisition time of 0.5 s.  \n\nThe sample chemical composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) \n\nusing a M4 TORNADO (Bruker) spectrometer. This instrument was equipped with 2 \n\nanodes a rhodium X-ray tube 50 kV/600 mA (30 W) and a tungsten X-Ray tube 50 \n\nkV/700 mA (35 W). For sample characterization, the rhodium X-ray tube with a poly-\n\ncapillary lens enabling excitation of an area of 200 ?m was utilised. A Silicon-Drift \n\nSi(Li) detector with Peltier cooling (253\u00b0K) and a resolution&lt;145 eV at 100000 cps \n\n(Mn K?) was used. The measurements were conducted under vacuum (20 mbar). \n\nQuantitative analysis was carried out using fundamental parameter (FP) (standardless).  \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\nThe catalyst reducibility was studied using an Autochem II (Micrometrics) \n\ntemperature-programmed reduction (TPR) system. The samples were reduced under a \n\nflow of 5 % H2 in argon (50 mL/min) and heated up to 800 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min. The \n\ncatalyst Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acidities were monitored by infrared spectroscopy (IR) \n\nwith pyridine adsorption. The IR spectra were recorded using a Thermo iS10 \n\nspectrometer (DTGC detector, 64 scans at 4 cm\n-1\n\n resolution). The samples were \n\npretreated under vacuum (10\n-\n5 Torr) at 450 \u00b0C for 5 h. After pre-treatment, pyridine \n\nwas adsorbed on the sample and the sample was then heated under vacuum (10\n-5\n\n Torr) \n\nat 150 \u00b0C. The spectra before and after the Py adsorption were collected at ambient \n\ntemperature. The amounts of Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid sites were calculated using the \n\nintensity of bands at ~1545 cm\n-1\n\n and ~1455 cm\n-1\n\n, respectively. The absorption \n\ncoefficients ?(B)=1.08 for Br\u00f6nsted acid sites (peak at ~1545 cm\n-1\n\n) and \n\n?(L)=1.71 cm mol\n-1\n\n for Lewis acid sites (peaks at ~1455-1445 cm\n-1\n\n) were used for \n\nquantification of the zeolite acid sites. \n\nThe TEM observations of the samples were obtained by using a Jeol 2100F \n\ninstrument operated at 200 kV. Before the analysis, the samples were dispersed by \n\nultrasound in ethanol for 5 min, and a drop of the suspension was deposited onto a \n\ncarbon membrane on a 300 mesh copper grid. The STEM-HAADF tomographic \n\nanalysis was carried out on a Jeol 2100F (field emission gun) microscope operating at \n\n200 kV by using a spot size of 1.1 \u00c5 with a current density of 0.5 pA \u00c5\n-1\n\n. Selected Area \n\nElectron Diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded using a US1000XP CCD camera \n\nwith an exposure time of 2 s on circular areas of 200 nm diameter. \n\n \n\nCatalytic tests \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\nHydrogenation of aromatics: Toluene or triisopropylbenzene hydrogenations \n\nwere carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (50 mg) was loaded in the stainless-\n\nsteel reactor and then activated in a H2 gas flow (10 cm\n3\n/min, atmospheric pressure) at \n\n400 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 \u00b0C/min.  The reactor was cooled below to 50 \u00b0C, a \n\nhydrogen flow with a pressure of 20 bar was introduced into the reactor. The \n\ntemperature was raised at 1 \u00b0C/min to the required reaction temperature (250 \u00b0C). The \n\nliquid reagents (toluene or triisopropylbenzene) were injected by pump (PHD ULTRA \n\n4400, Harvard Apparatus) with a flow rate (0.8 mL/h). The products were collected in a \n\ncold tap and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Bruker GC-450) equipped with thermal \n\nconductivity (TCD) and flame ionization (FID) detectors.  \n\nFischer Tropsch synthesis: the experiments were performed in a fixed-bed \n\nreactor. Prior to testing, the samples were reduced in situ in pure H2  flow (3 cm\n3\n/min) at \n\n400 \u00b0C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3\u00b0C/min. After the reactor was cooled down to \n\nroom temperature, the flow was switched to syngas (H2/CO = 2) and the pressure \n\nadjusted to 20 bar. Nitrogen (5% relative to CO) was used as the internal standard. After \n\nachieving the desired pressure, the temperature was increased to the reaction \n\ntemperature, i.e. 250 \u00b0C, at a rate of 3 \u00b0C/min. The gas space velocities were adjusted to \n\nobtain CO conversion of 30-40% for all catalysts. The gaseous reaction products, i.e. up \n\nto C5, were analyzed on-line using a GC equipped with a FID and a TCD detectors \n\n(Varian, CP-3800). The remaining products (wax) were condensed under pressure and \n\nanalyzed ex situ on a Shimadzu GC with FID (2010-Plus-AF). \n\nAnisole acylation: the activity of all catalysts was evaluated in the acylation \n\nreaction between anisole and hexanoic acid according to the following protocol. The \n\ncatalyst (20 mg) was added to a mixture of anisole (2 g) and hexanoic acid (0.3 g) in a \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\nreflux reactor system. Upon sealing, the tube was heated at 180 \u00b0C for 2 h. The products \n\nwere analyzed by gas chromatography. \n\n \n\n5.3 Results and Discussion  \n\nThe nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms for the catalysts prepared by \n\nimpregnation and synthesized using the Me/CNT templates are shown in Figure 5-1.  \n\n     \n\n      \nFigure 5-1 Low temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms on the HZSM-5 \n\nzeolite synthetized with and without addition of CNT (a) cobalt (b), nickel (c) and \n\nmagnesium (d) ZSM-5 catalysts. \n\n \n\nThe ZSM-5 sample displays a type-I isotherm exhibiting a sharp uptake at low \n\nrelative pressure followed by a plateau with a hardly visible hysteresis at P/P0>0.5.

The difference between the surface area and pore volume of \n\nthe parent zeolite and its counterparts containing metals may be assigned to both, the \n\neffect of zeolite \u201cdilution\u201d by metals and partial pore blocking by the metal species. \n\nOnly the microporous zeolite volume is affected by impregnation with metals in \n\nCo/ZSM-5, Ni/ZSM-5 and Mg/ZSM-5 as compared to the parent ZSM-5 zeolite, while \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\nalmost no changes are observed in the mesoporous volume. This fact indicates that the \n\nmetal cations are preferentially located in the zeolite micropores, whereas the major part \n\nof the metal species, e.g. metal oxides, in the case of ZSM-5 is located on the zeolite \n\nexternal surface. \n\nRemarkably, rather different isotherms and textural properties were observed for \n\nthe ZSM-5 zeolites synthetized in the presence of Me/CNT templates. The zeolites \n\nprepared in the presence of Co/CNT, Ni/CNT and Mg/CNT templates exhibit a \n\ncombination of type I and IV isotherms with a significant N2 uptake at low relative \n\npressure and a hysteresis loop at high relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.5, Figure 5-1b-d). \n\nAdsorption of nitrogen in the range of P/P0 = 0.5 - 1.0 and relevant hysteresis can be \n\nexplained by mesoporosity developed by the presence of cobalt, nickel or magnesium \n\noxides supported on CNT. Note that almost no increase in the zeolite mesoporosoity \n\nwas observed when pure CNT(10-20) or CNT(20-40) were used as mesoporous hard \n\ntemplates (Table 5-1). Importantly, the presence of metal species on CNT is essential \n\nfor the synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite with enhanced mesoporous volume. A slight increase \n\nin the BET surface area was also observed for CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5, NiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-\n\n5 and MgCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5, while the BET surface area slightly decreases when using \n\nthe Me/CNT(20-40) templates. Thus, the most significant effect of using CNT containing \n\ncobalt, nickel and magnesium is the substantial increase in the mesoporous volume.  \n\nThe zeolite mesoporous volume increases 2.5-4 times, when using CoCNT(10-20) and \n\nCo/CNT(20-40), 4.5-5 times, when using  MgCNT(10-20) and MgCNT(20-40) and 2.2-3 times \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nfor NiCNT(10-20) and NiCNT(20-40) (Table 5-1). Note that the zeolite micropore volume \n\n(between 0.09-0.13 cm\n3\n/g) is only slightly affected by CNT supported metals used as \n\nsecondary templates.  \n\nFigure 5-2 displays XRD patterns of all samples included in the present study. \n\nThe characteitic XRD peaks of the MFI structure are observed in all samples, regardless \n\nof the employed synthesis procedure. No halo peaks, which can be attributed to the \n\namorphous phase, have been observed. Note that the presence of metals in the catalysts \n\nleads to somewhat lower intensity of the zeolite XRD patterns, which is due to the \n\ndilution of the MFI phase with the metal oxides. In the Co/ZSM-5, CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 \n\nor CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 samples a peak at 36.9 \u00b0 which is characteritic to the Co3O4 can \n\nbe observed. The particle size of Co3O4 calculated using the Scherrer equation (Table 5-\n\n1) was 27-44 nm. Such large size suggests that the main fraction of cobalt oxide is \n\nlocated either in large mesopores or on the zeolite external surface. The Ni/ZSM-5 \n\ncatalyst prepared using impregnation with nickel nitrate showed a very low intense \n\nXRD peaks at 43.2\u00b0 attributed to the face-centered cubic phase NiO (JCPDS card no. \n\n#47-1049). The Ni/CNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 or Ni/CNT(20-40)/ZSM- catalysts prepared using \n\nNi/CNT(10-20) and Ni/CNT(20-40) as hard templates did not show any peaks characteristic \n\nof the nickel oxide phases. No XRD peaks assigned to the Mg-containing phases were \n\ndetected in either Mg/ZSM-5 prepared via aqueous impregnation or in MgCNT(10-\n\n20)/ZSM-5 and MgCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 catalysts prepared using hydrothermal synthesis \n\nwith the Mg/CNT hard template. The absence of XRD peaks attributed to the metal \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\noxide phases can be explained by smaller metal oxide particle size in the Mg- and Ni-\n\ncontaining samples, which are below the XRD detection limits. \n\n \n\nFigure 5-2 XRD patterns of the metal ZSM-5 catalysts. \n\nFigure 5-3 shows the TEM images of the Co, Ni and Mg containing ZSM-5 \n\ncatalysts prepared using metal-CNT templates. They are very different from those \n\nusually observed for the conventional ZSM-5 zeolite. The zeolite crystallites obtained in \n\nthe presence of metal CNT templates exhibit a rather irregular fibrous shape leading to \n\nthe development of zeolite mesoporosity. TEM images suggest zeolite crystallization \n\nover CNT. This shape arises from CNT partially encapsulated inside the zeolite crystals \n\nduring the zeolite synthesis. The synthesized zeolite seems to replicas of Me/CNT. They \n\nreproduce almost exactly the shape of the secondary templates. Importantly, the \n\npresence of metal containing CNT seems indispensable for obtaining these fibrous \n\n5 15 25 35 45 55 65\n\n2?\n\nZSM-5\n\nCo/ZSM-5\n\nCoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nMg/ZSM-5\n\nMgCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nMgCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nNi/ZSM-5\n\nNiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nNiCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\nzeolite crystallites.

Figure 5-4 displays well defined \n\ndiffraction patterns and clearly indicates zeolite crystalline phase in the areas containing \n\na larger quantify of fibrous zeolite replicas of the Me/CNT templates. \n\n1 0 0  n m\n1 0 0  n m\n\n2 0  n m\n\nA B\n\n\n\n123 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5-4 TEM image and SAED patterns of NiCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 zeolite. \n\n \n\nSTEM-HAADF electron tomography of the CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 sample has \n\nconfirmed localization of metal oxide nanoparticles within the zeolite (Figure 5-5). Co \n\nnanoparticles have been observed as bright spots with diameter in the range 2-5 nm. \n\nSTEM-HAADF images show that nanoparticles are located inside the pores of \n\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-zeolite. Thus, electron microscopy, electron diffraction and \n\ntomography in combination with other characterization techniques revealed the \n\nimportant role of small metal oxide clusters in CNT for the formation of mesopores in \n\nzeolite crystals. Note that no noticeable enhancement of the zeolite mesoporosity was \n\nobserved by using metal-free CNT as secondary templates (Table 5-1). \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5-5 STEM-HAADF electron tomography analysis of CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 \n\ncatalyst clearly showing the presence of cobalt nanoparticles inside the zeolite structure. \n\n \n\nThe ZSM-5 zeolite nucleation seems to occur on the metal oxide sites located on \n\nCNT and results in the hierarchical zeolites with enhanced mesoporosity. The resulting \n\nzeolite replicates the fibrous shape of CNT. The mesopores are created when CNT are \n\nremoved from the zeolite by calcination. A scheme illustrating the formation of \n\nhierarchical zeolite during the synthesis utilizing Me/CNT as secondary hard templates \n\nis shown in Figure 5-6. It is important to emphasize that the stability of metal oxide \n\nnanoparticles supported on CNT in the basic medium used for zeolite synthesis is \n\nessential for obtaining hierarchical zeolites with enhanced mesoporosity.

The reduction patterns of the cobalt zeolite catalysts are consistent with \n\nthe presence of several types of cobalt species and two-step Co3O4 reduction to metallic \n\ncobalt. Previous reports \n[27-29]\n\n suggest that Co3O4 is first reduced to CoO at a lower \n\ntemperature, whereas CoO is reduced to metallic Co at higher temperatures (Figure \n\n5-7a). The Co/ZSM-5 sample with cobalt added by impregnation exhibits a TPR peak at \n\n280\u00b0C with shoulders at 150-220 \u00b0C. The shoulders at 150-220 \u00b0C in the TPR profile of \n\nCo/ZSM-5 can be therefore attributed to the reduction of the Co3O4 nanoparticles to \n\nCoO, while the major TPR peak at 280\u00b0C corresponds to the reduction of CoO to \n\nmetallic cobalt. Previously we showed that the ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by \n\nimpregnation contained a large fraction of cobalt oxide nanoparticles on the zeolite \n\nouter surface. Because of a larger solvating shell, diffusion of multi-charged ions such \n\nas cobalt or nickel, inside the ZSM-5 micropores can be rather slow \n[30]\n\n.

The CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 samples \n\nexhibited two groups of TPR peaks at 150-420 \u00b0C and at 600 \u2013 800 \u00b0C. Similar to the \n\nCo/ZSM-5 zeolite, the low temperature peaks are attributed to the reduction of small \n\nCo3O4 nanoparticles to metallic cobalt via intermediate formation of CoO.  The shift of \n\nthese peaks to higher temperature can be explained by smaller Co3O4 particle sizes \n[31]\n\n \n\nand their localization inside the zeolite meso- and micropores. In agreement with \n\nprevious studies \n[32, 33]\n\n, the peaks at higher temperature are assigned to cobalt silicates or \n\naluminates. These mixed compounds form because of the interaction and chemical \n\nreactions between the small metal oxide nanoparticles located on CNT and zeolite \n\nsynthetized under the hydrothermal conditions. The TPR data are consistent with the \n\nsuggestions that cobalt species supported on CNT act as nucleation sites in the synthesis \n\nof the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. \n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\nCo/ZSM-5\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nCoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nNi/ZSM-5\n\nNiCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nNiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\n \n\nFigure 5-7 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of the Co (a) and Ni (b) \n\ncatalysts. \n \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \n\nThe reduction profiles of the nickel catalysts prepared by impregnation with \n\nnickel nitrate and synthetized using Ni/CNT as secondary templates are shown in Figure \n\n5-7b. They exhibit broad hydrogen consumption peaks in the temperature range from \n\n350 to 750\u00b0C. A single hydrogen consumption peak at about 400\u00b0C \n[34, 35]\n\n is usually \n\nobserved in the TPR profile of bulk NiO. It corresponds to the reduction of NiO to \n\nmetallic nickel. Thus, the low temperature peaks located between 400 and 500\u00b0C in the \n\nTPR profiles of nickel-zeolite catalysts may correspond to the reduction of small NiO \n\nparticles. Note that the Ni/ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by impregnation usually contains a \n\nsignificant concentration of NiO on the zeolite outer surface. These NiO nanoparticles \n\nare detected in Ni/ZSM-5 by XRD (Figure 5-2). Similar to cobalt zeolite \n\nnanocomposites, the shift of the TPR peaks to a higher temperature can be due to the \n\nsmaller NiO particle size and some diffusional limitations during their reduction arising \n\nfrom the localization of these small NiO nanoparticles in the porous material \n[36]\n\n. The \n\narea of the low temperature TPR peaks between 400\u00b0 and 500 \u00b0C significantly decreases \n\nfor the catalysts prepared using Ni/CNT as secondary templates. This corresponds to the \n\ndecrease in the concentration of the NiO particles on the zeolite outer surface.  The TPR \n\nprofiles of the NiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and NiCNT(20-40)CNT/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit low \n\nintensity peaks at 500-700 \u00b0C. High temperature TPR peaks can be attributed to the \n\nreduction of highly dispersed nickel species \n[37]\n\n or to the presence of nickel silicate \n\n(phyllosilicate) species \n[ 38, 39]\n\n. In agreement with other characterization methods, the \n\nTPR results clearly show that introduction of nickel and cobalt species with CNT during \n\nthe zeolite hydrothermal synthesis results to higher metal dispersion. In cobalt catalysts, \n\nmetal nanoparticle localization within zeolite meso- and micropores also leads to the \n\nformation of mixed compounds between metal oxide, silica or alumina.  \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\nThe acidity of the metal-zeolite catalysts has been characterized by FTIR using \n\nadsorption of pyridine (Py) as a probe for Br\u00f6nsted (BAS) and Lewis acid sites (LAS). \n\nThe FTIR spectra recorded after Py adsorption on the reduced catalysts are displayed in \n\nFigure 5-8. The pure ZSM-5 zeolite exhibits characteristic bands at ~1545 and 1455-45 \n\ncm\n-1\n\n assigned to the pyridinum ion (PyH\n+\n) formed on BAS and to Py adsorbed on LAS \n\n(which may also include metal ions such as Co\n2+\n\n, Ni\n2+\n\n or Mg\n2+\n\n), respectively. Py \n\nadsorbed on both the LAS and BAS also displays a band at 1490 cm\n-1\n\n. The \n\nconcentrations of BAS and LAS calculated using the molar absorption coefficients for \n\nthe bands at ~1545 and 1455-45 cm\n-1\n\n are shown in Table 5-1. Impregnation of the ZSM-\n\n5 zeolite with Co\n2+\n\n, Ni\n2+,\n\n and Mg\n2+\n\n cations leads to a significant decrease in the \n\nconcentration of BAS. The effect is more pronounced for the Mg\n2+\n\n impregnated ZSM-5. \n\nA much lower concentration of BAS in the impregnated catalysts can be explained by \n\nthe ion exchange of the zeolite bridging OH group protons with the Mg\n2+\n\n, Ni\n2+\n\n and Co\n2+\n\n \n\nions. Small metal oxide clusters can also block some zeolite microporesthus making \n\nsome of BAS inaccessible for Py adsorption. Interestingly, at the same metal content in \n\nthe zeolites, the decrease in the concentration of BAS is less significant, when the \n\ncations are introduced with the Me/CNT hard templates. This suggests that a significant \n\nfraction of the metal species added with Me/CNT are probably not localized in the \n\ncationic zeolite sites but present as small oxide clusters in the zeolite micro- and \n\nmesopores. This explain a less significant decrease in the number of BAS in the zeolites \n\nsynthetized using the Me/CNT hard templates with the same metal contents. \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5-8 FTIR spectra observed after adsorption of Py on cobalt (a), nickel (b) and \n\nmagnesium (c) zeolite catalysts \n\n \n\nThe number of LAS is considerably higher in all metal containing ZSM-5 as \n\ncompared to their metal-free ZSM-5 counterpart (Table 5-1). The addition of the metals \n\nresults in the generation of news types of Lewis acid sites such as coordinatively \n\nunsaturated Co\n2+\n\n, Ni\n2+\n\n or Mg\n2+\n\n cations.  Some of these cations can occupy zeolite \n\ncationic sites. Interestingly, a much lower concentration of Lewis acid sites is generated \n\nin the metal zeolite catalysts prepared using zeolite crystallization in the presence of \n\nmetal CNT secondary templates as compared to the sample prepared by zeolite \n\nimpregnation with nitrates. This can be due to a lower concentration of Co\n2+\n\n, Ni\n2+\n\n and \n\nMg\n2+\n\n in the cationic sites of the hierarchical zeolites. This also indicates the formation \n\nof metal oxide clusters and is consistent with a smaller decrease in the number of BAS \n\nin the zeolites prepared using the Me/CNT hard templates. \n\n \n\n1400150016001700\n\nWavenumbers (cm-1) \n\nZSM-5\n\nCo/ZM-5\n\nCoCNT10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\na \n\n1400150016001700\n\nWavenumbers (cm-1) \n\nNi/ZSM-5\n\nNiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nNiCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nb \n\n1400150016001700\n\nWavenumbers (cm-1) \n\nMg/ZSM-5\n\nMgCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5\n\nMgCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5\n\nc \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\nCatalytic Performance in Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, Hydrogenation and Acylation \n\nReactions \n\nThe results of catalytic tests of cobalt zeolite catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch \n\nsynthesis are presented in Table 5-2. Hydrocarbons and water were major reaction \n\nproducts of carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Extremely small amounts of CO2 were \n\nobserved. By varying GHSV between 20 and 70 L/hgCo, the CO conversion of 30 \u2013 40% \n\nwas obtained for all catalysts. The reaction rate normalized by the amount of cobalt in \n\nthe catalysts slightly increases for CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and decreases in CoCNT(20-\n\n40)/ZSM-5 compared to the Co/ZSM-5 sample prepared by conventional impregnation.  \n\nNote however, that TPR (Figure 5-7a) is indicative of very different cobalt reducibility \n\nin different samples. The addition of the Co/CNT hard templates during the zeolite \n\nsynthesis results in the formation of barely reducible cobalt silicate or cobalt aluminate \n\nspecies, which exhibit TPR peaks at 800-900\u00b0C. The peaks at 800-900\u00b0C are absent in \n\nthe TPR profiles of Co/ZSM-5. This suggests a low concentration of cobalt silicates or \n\naluminates in the Co/ZSM-5 catalyst prepared by impregnation.  Interestingly, the \n\nactivity per reducible cobalt increased 5 \u2013 10 times over CoCNT/ZSM-5 prepared using \n\nCoCNT as secondary templates in comparison with Co/ZSM-5 prepared by \n\nimpregnation. The methane selectivity varied between 13 \u2013 37%. Previous report \n[40]\n\n \n\nsuggests that the higher methane selectivity over zeolite based catalysts can be due to \n\nmore significant diffusion limitations for carbon monoxide molecules compared to \n\nhydrogen.  Slower diffusion of CO relative to hydrogen results in the CO deficiency the \n\nzeolite pores. The resulting higher H2/CO ratio in the narrow zeolite pores leads to a \n\nhigher contribution of methanation reaction and higher methane selectivity.  \n\nImportantly, lower methane selectivity was observed over CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and \n\nCoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 with larger mesoporous volume. These catalysts may have less \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\nsignificant diffusion limitations compared to mostly microporous Co/ZSM-5, where \n\ncobalt was added by impregnation. The catalysts prepared using the CoCN5(10-20) and \n\nCoCNT(20-40) hard templates also exhibit a higher selectivity to the C5\n+\n products (around \n\n74%) as compared to the conventional Co/ZSM-5 catalysts which exhibited C5+ \n\nselectivity of 48% (Table 5-2).  \n\nTable 5-2.

These reactions were used to evaluate the activity and \n\naccessibility of nickel metal sites in the hierarchical zeolites. The mesoporosity \n\ndeveloped in the nickel-zeolite catalysts synthetized in the presence of Ni/CNT \n\nsecondary templates results in a significantly higher hydrogenation rate in both toluene \n\nand 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene reactions. The reaction rate increases in the order: \n\nNi/SZM-5&lt;NiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5<NiCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5. This is therefore indicative of a \n\nbetter nickel dispersion and enhanced accessibility of nickel metallic sites in the zeolites \n\nprepared using the Ni/CNT hard templates. Noteworthy, the zeolite prepared using \n\nNiCNT(20-40) with larger CNT diameter exhibited higher reaction rate in both toluene \n\nand 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene hydrogenation reactions. \n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\nTable 5-3.

Acylation of \n\nanisole with hexanoic acid was selected as a model reaction to characterize the catalytic \n\nperformance of the acid sites on the outer surface and in the mesopores of the \n\nhierarchical zeolites (Figure 5-9).  \n\n \n\nFigure 5-9 Acylation of anisole with hexanoic acid results in ortho-methoxy-hexyl-\n\nphenone. \n\n \n\nOn all catalysts evaluated in the present work, the reaction results in the \n\nformation of ortho-methoxy-hexyl-phenone with the selectivity higher than 90%, while \n\nthe selectivity to the para-isomer was less than 10%. Only traces of the meta-isomer \n\nwere detected.  Note that the size of the ortho-isomer is much higher than the dimeter of \n\nmicropores in the ZSM-5 zeolite. Higher selectivity to the larger size ortho- methoxy-\n\nhexyl-phenone is consistent with the critical role of the zeolite acid sites on the zeolite \n\nouter surface and mesopores in this reaction. The hexanoic acid conversion and reaction \n\nrate are displayed in Table 5-4. For all catalysts, the conversion increases, when \n\nMe/CNTs were added as hard templates during the zeolite synthesis.

The effect is more pronounced when CNT had a relatively large (20-\n\n40 nm) diameter. The highest conversion was achieved over NiCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5. \n\nTable 5-4.

Both the concentration of Br\u00f6nsted acid \n\nsites and the presence of mesopores created in the ZSM-5 zeolite in the presence of \n\nmetal supported CNT affect the catalytic performance in the anisole acylation. \n\nInterestingly, at similar concentration of BAS, the higher acylation rates were observed \n\nfor the catalysts with higher mesoporosity. In particular, the CNT diameter is important \n\nfor preparing the metal zeolite catalysts with higher reaction rates. The zeolites with \n\nlarger mesopores obtained using Me/CNT with the diameter of 20-40 nm were the most \n\nactive in this reaction. This suggests a better accessibility of both Br\u00f6nsted and metal \n\nsites in the hierarchical ZSM-5 prepared using the Me/CNT templates. Hence, the \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nstrategy for synthesis of hierarchical zeolites using metal supported CNT as secondary \n\nhard templates seems promising. It produces hierarchical zeolites replicating the shape \n\nof CNT with enhanced mesoporosity and containing highly dispersed, accessible and \n\nuniformly distributed metal and acid sites, which will be certainly beneficial for several \n\nimportant catalytic reactions.   \n\n \n\nFigure 5-10 Hexanoic acid conversion in anisole acylation over the metal zeolite \n\ncatalysts prepared by impregnation and using Me/CNT as secondary hard templates. \n\n \n\n5.3 Conclusion  \n\nA new synthesis strategy for the preparation of hierarchical zeolites preparation \n\nhas been developed. The zeolite crystallites were prepared under hydrothermal \n\nconditions in the presence of CNT supported metal nanoparticles used as secondary \n\nhard templates. The Me/CNT templates play three roles in the synthesis of hierarchical \n\nzeolite. These templates are at the same time (i) a zeolite synthesis replica, (ii) a \n\nmesoporogen and (a) a tool to introduce uniformly distributed metal species into \n\nzeolites. \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\nThe metal oxide species seem to be nucleation sites and crystallization modifier \n\nleading to the fibrous zeolite structures, which largely replicates the CNT. Using \n\nMe/CNT as templates leads a several-fold increase in the zeolite mesoporous volume. In \n\nthe synthetized zeolites, the dispersed metal species are uniformly distributed within the \n\ncrystallites and mostly present as small metal oxide nanoparticles. The concentration of \n\nBr\u00f6nsted acid sites in the zeolites synthetized using Me/CNT as secondary templates is \n\nhigher than in the zeolites with the same amount of metal species prepared via \n\nimpregnation.  \n\nBecause of a decrease in the diffusion limitations and uniform distribution of \n\nmetal nanoparticles in the zeolite, the resulting materials have shown improved catalytic \n\nperformance in three catalytic reactions: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation of \n\naromatics and anisole acylation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n[1] Corma, A.

The main objective of this Ph. \n\nD. thesis was to design bifunctional catalysts on the basis of metal nanoparticles and \n\nmesoporous zeolites with the target to enhance their catalytic performance in different \n\nreactions such as Fischer Tropsch synthesis, toluene and 1, 3, 5 triisoproplybenzene \n\nhydrogenation and acylation of anisole. The work followed three parallel and \n\ncomplementary paths. The first one (Chapter 3) is centered on the study of influence of \n\nimpregnation and ion exchange sequence, in particular on the metal localization, acidity \n\nof cobalt supported on the large pore BEA zeolite. The second (Chapter 4) is focused on \n\nthe production of iso-paraffins from syngas, more specifically by creating hierarchical \n\nZSM-5 zeolite using cobalt CNT as sacrificial template. The third (Chapter 5) is aimed \n\non mesoporosity creation of ZSM-5 using different metals like nickel and magnesium \n\nsupported on CNT. \n\n  \n\n6.1 General Conclusion \n\nIn chapter III, four different catalysts prepared using different ion exchange \n\nsequence were synthesized: Co/HBEA, CoH/HBEA, Co/NaBEA, CoH/NaBEA. Cobalt \n\nimpregnation on the H-from of BEA results in cobalt localization on the outer surface \n\nand in the zeolite micropores. The deposition of cobalt on the BEA zeolite external \n\nsurface and in the micropores leads to cracking and higher methane selectivities in FT \n\nsynthesis. The catalyst CoH/NaBEA with the Co species localized on the external \n\nsurface and high concentration of Br?nsted acid sites in the zeolite micropores, showed \n\n\n\n142 \n\n \n\nlower methane selectivity, higher selectivity to long chain hydrocarbons and significant \n\nyield of isomerized hydrocarbons. This strategy seems to have several advantages for \n\nthe design of bifunctional catalysts over large pore zeolites.  \n\nIn chapter IV, the use of the bifunctional Co/ZSM-5 catalysts enhanced the iso-\n\nparaffin selectivity in FT synthesis. This improvement can be attributed by creation of \n\nthe mesopores in the ZSM-5 zeolite using metal-CNT as templates. The mesoporosity \n\nincreased 3-4 times by introducing Co/CNT during the zeolite synthesis. Besides that, \n\nwhen cobalt was impregnated in the CNT and then placed in the synthesis gel, the \n\nresulting zeolite had higher amount of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites. This methodology leads to \n\nmore uniform metal distribution on the support and greater proximity between active \n\nmetal sites and acid sites from the zeolite. The catalysts prepared using Co/CNT as \n\nsecondary templates presented an enhanced selectivity to isomerized branched \n\nhydrocarbons and lower methane selectivity. \n\nIn chapter V, the methodology used to create hierarchical zeolite with metal \n\nCNT was extended to other metals like Ni and Mg. The deposed metal particles have \n\nuniform distribution in the crystallites of hierarchical zeolites. Important roles of the \n\nmetal carbon nanotubes in the zeolite synthesis are uncovered. First, Me/CNT serve as a \n\nreplica to create zeolites with specific fibrous morphology. Second, they fulfill the role \n\nof a mesoporogen and markedly increase the zeolite secondary porosity. Finally, they \n\nact as a vehicle to uniformly introduce the metal functions inside the mesoporous \n\nzeolites. The presence of metals in carbon nanotubes is essential for the enhancement of \n\nmesoporosity. \n\nThis thesis clearly shows that the catalytic performance of metal zeolite composite \n\ncatalysts is a function of zeolite mesoporososity, zeolite pore sizes, zeolite acidity and \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\nlocalization of metal nanoparticles on the zeolite outer surface or in the zeolite \n\nmicropores. Because of the decrease in the diffusion limitations and uniform \n\ndistribution of metal nanoparticles in the zeolite, the resulting materials have shown \n\nimproved catalytic performance in three catalytic reactions: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, \n\nhydrogenation of aromatics and anisole acylation. \n\n \n\n6.2 Perspectives \n\nThus, efficient control of localization of metal and acid sites within metal zeolite \n\ncomposite catalysts is a very useful tool to tune the catalytic performance for many \n\ncatalytic reactions. The results of this thesis allow us to propose new strategies for the \n\ndesign of bifunctional catalysts. In particular, two new methodologies can be further \n\ndeveloped such as  \n\n- Introducing one metal inside the CNT and another metal outside the CNT when \n\nusing Me/CNT as templates for zeolite synthesis. This strategy should reduce formation \n\nof barely reducible metal silicates with the metal species which are located inside CNT; \n\n- Microemulsion methodology which might control the size of metal nanoparticles \n\ndeposed inside the micro and mesopores of zeolite and \n\n- Catalyst deactivation is a major challenge for the design of bifunctional \n\ncatalysts. Though the catalysts developed in these work were stable in lab scale \n\nexperiments, further long duration tests are required to evaluate their stability under \n\nindustrial conditions."}]}}}
