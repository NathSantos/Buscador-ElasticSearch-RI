Diversos estudos \nt\u00eam enfatizado o papel do macrobentos como indicador da qualidade ambiental desses ecossistemas, \no que tem levado ao desenvolvimento de ferramentas e m\u00e9todos baseados em seus atributos \n(abund\u00e2ncia, biomassa, composi\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica, etc.). Dentre esses, os \u00edndices bi\u00f3ticos t\u00eam sido \npreferidos em termos de precis\u00e3o e de custo-benef\u00edcio, sendo o AMBI (\u00cdndice Bi\u00f3tico Marinho) o mais \naplicado, com sucesso, em v\u00e1rias \u00e1reas geogr\u00e1ficas submetidas a diferentes fontes de impacto. \nContudo, poucas informa\u00e7\u00f5es a respeito da ecologia das comunidades macrobent\u00f4nicas est\u00e3o \ndispon\u00edveis para a costa atl\u00e2ntica da Am\u00e9rica do Sul, estando concentradas nas regi\u00f5es sudeste e sul \ndo continente. Dessa forma, o presente estudo teve como objetivos descrever a composi\u00e7\u00e3o e \ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o do macrobentos de \u00e1reas estuarinas de Pernambuco, testando o efeito do tamanho da \nabertura da peneira (1,0mm x 0,5mm) e da profundidade de amostragem (0-10cm x 0-20cm) na \ndescri\u00e7\u00e3o das associa\u00e7\u00f5es da fauna e examinar a efici\u00eancia do AMBI na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade \nambiental desses estu\u00e1rios. As coletas ocorreram em Outubro-2007, em 14 pontos situados na costa \nde Pernambuco, sendo amostrados al\u00e9m do macrobentos, par\u00e2metros f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos de \u00e1gua \n(salinidade, temperatura, oxig\u00eanio dissolvido, am\u00f4nia) e de sedimento (mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, \ngranulometria, potencial redox, nitrog\u00eanio-total), al\u00e9m do microfitobentos. Um total de 14.257 \nindiv\u00edduos distribu\u00eddos em 78 t\u00e1xons e com uma biomassa total de 83,64g foram observados. Em \ngeral, as diferen\u00e7as na reten\u00e7\u00e3o das peneiras foram importantes para a abund\u00e2ncia total (j\u00e1 que a \npeneira de 1,0mm reteve apenas 28% dos indiv\u00edduos), sendo pouco evidente para a biomassa total \n(92% da biomassa). Por outro lado, em termos de profundidade de amostragem, o estrato de 0-10cm \ncompreendeu quase todos os indiv\u00edduos (94% da abund\u00e2ncia total), mas contribuiu apenas com 39% \nda biomassa total. Foram encontradas apenas rela\u00e7\u00f5es significativas para o fator \u201cpeneiras\u201d tanto \npara a diversidade N1 (ANOVA 2-way: F1;13=5,17; p=0,02) quanto para a estrutura das comunidades \n(ANOSIM 2-way: Rglobal= 0,142; p=0,002). Correla\u00e7\u00f5es significativas foram estabelecidas entre as \nvari\u00e1veis nitrog\u00eanio total (r=0,860; p<0,0001), mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica (r=0,801; p<0,001) e microfitobentos \n(r=0,749; p=0,005 and r=0,795; p=0,002, para clorofila-a e feopigmentos, respectivamente) contra a \nabund\u00e2ncia da fauna retida nas peneiras de 1,0mm e de 0,5mm. De modo geral, o macrobentos dos \nestu\u00e1rios estudados \u00e9 composto por pequenas esp\u00e9cies (1,0-0,5mm), de modo que o uso da peneira \nde 0,5mm permite uma interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o mais precisa dos dados; al\u00e9m disso, para a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da \nfauna e abund\u00e2ncia, a camada superficial (0-10cm) \u00e9 claramente mais importante enquanto que, para \nbiomassa, a camada de fundo (10-20cm) deve ser considerada. Para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade \nambiental, o \u00edndice AMBI mostrou que todas as \u00e1reas estudadas apresentaram algum n\u00edvel de \ndist\u00farbio, variando de 2,395 (pouco polu\u00eddo, Ariquind\u00e1) a 5,236 (fortemente polu\u00eddo, Capibaribe). Em \ngeral, todas as \u00e1reas estiveram dentro dos limites de pouco a moderadamente polu\u00eddo, devido \u00e0 \ngrande propor\u00e7\u00e3o dos t\u00e1xons Oligochaeta e Nematoda (esp\u00e9cies tolerantes, grupo ecol\u00f3gico III). O \n\u00edndice provou ser eficiente na detec\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade desses estu\u00e1rios, embora sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o para \n\u00e1guas tropicais requeira algumas adapta\u00e7\u00f5es na classifica\u00e7\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gica das esp\u00e9cies. \n \n \nPalavras-chave: Macrobentos, tamanho da peneira, profundidade de amostragem, \u00edndice AMBI, \nqualidade ambiental.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n \nEstuarine environments are known by its importance in terms of complexity and biodiversity; however, \nanthropogenic activities continue to have a detrimental effect on its biodiversity levels on a worldwide-\nscale. Several studies have emphasized the role of benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of \nenvironmental quality status in these ecosystems, which have lead a growing number of tools and \nmethods based on macrofauna attributes (abundance, biomass, species composition). Among them, \nbiotic indices has been chosen in terms of accuracy and cost-benefit, being the AMBI (AZTI Marine \nBiotic Index) the most successfully applied to different geographic areas and under different impact \nsources. However, few studies regarding ecological characteristic of soft-bottom macrobenthic \ncommunities on the Atlantic coast of South America are available and thoroughly concentrated in the \nsouth and southeast coasts. Hence, the main objectives of this contribution were to describe \ncomposition and distribution of macrobenthos from estuarine areas of Pernambuco and tests if \nparticular sieve mesh sizes (1.0mm x 0.5mm) and sampling depth (0-10cm x 0-20cm) alter the \nmacrobenthic association descriptors; in addition, to examine the efficiency of AMBI index to evaluate \nthe environmental quality of these estuaries. Samples for abiotic variables of water (salinity, \ntemperature, dissolved oxygen and ammonia-N) and sediment (organic matter, granulometry, redox \npotential, total-N), microphytobenthos and also macrofauna were collected at fourteen estuarine sites \nlocated in Pernambuco coastline, in October 2007. A total of 14,257 individuals, from 78 taxa and with \na biomass of 83.64gAFDW were observed. In general, the differences between 1.0mm and combined \nsieves retention are hardly evident for biomass but it is very important for the abundance (1.0mm sieve \nretained only 28% of total individuals but, at the same time, was responsible for 92% of total biomass). \nRegarding sampling depth, the top layer (0-10cm) presented almost all individuals (94% total \nabundance); however, contributed with only 39.06% of the overall biomass. Significant interactions \nwere observed only for \u201cmesh-sieve\u201d factor in terms of diversity N1 (two-way ANOVA: F1;13=5.17; \np=0.02) and community structure (two-way ANOSIM: Rglobal= 0.142; p=0.002). Pearson\u2019s correlation \nhave selected the variables total-N (r=0.860; p<0.0001), organic matter (r=0.801; p<0.001) and \nmicrophytobenthos (r=0.749; p=0.005 and r=0.795; p=0.002, for chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments, \nrespectively) as the most fit for explaining the \u201cchanges\u201d in fauna from 1.0mm to 0.5mm. The results \nshowed that these estuarine macrobenthos were mainly composed by small species (1,0-0.5mm), \nthus the use of the 0.5mm sieve will permit a more accurate interpretation of the data; besides for taxa \ncomposition and abundance, the top layer (0-10cm) is clearly the most important whereas for biomass \nthe bottom layer (10-20cm) presents this function. In terms of environmental quality, the AMBI index \nindicated that all ecosystems presented some level of disturbance, ranging from 2.395 (slightly \ndisturbed, in Ariquind\u00e1) to 5.236 (heavily disturbed, in Capibaribe). According to the index, most sites \nwere situated between the slightly-moderate disturbed boundaries, due to higher proportion of \nNematoda and Oligochaeta, both assigned here as ecological group III. In summary, AMBI proved to \nbe efficient in evaluating the quality status of Pernambuco estuaries, although its applicability in \ntropical waters requests some adaptations in species\u2019 ecological groups. \n \n \nKeywords: macrobenthos, sieve mesh-size, sampling depth, AMBI index, environmental quality \nstatus. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nLISTA DE FIGURAS \n \nCHAPTER I.

These \n\necosystems comprise approximately 8-15% of the coastal regions in the world (Kennish, 1992; \n\nBonecker et al., 2007) and are important areas for reproduction, nursing and feeding of at least \n\none stage of the life-cycle of several invertebrates and fishes, including high commercial value \n\nspecies (Muniz and Venturini, 2001; McLusky and Elliot, 2004; Joyeux et al., 2004).  \n\nHowever, a major scientific conclusion of the past century is that human population is \n\nchanging Earth\u2019s ecosystems in fundamental ways and the population has been increasing \n\nrapidly in the coastal zones, resulting in a multitude of ecological stresses on aquatic systems, \n\nespecially estuaries (Flemer and Champ, 2006). Anthropogenic activities, such as habitat \n\nmodification, pollution and overexploitation of living resources, continue to have a detrimental \n\neffect on global biodiversity levels and subsequent provision of estuarine resources (Jackson et \n\nal., 2001; Loreau et al., 2001); moreover, many estuaries are being used as repositories for \n\nindustrial effluents and domestic wastes (Ramos et al., 2006). \n\nAs coastal zone management strategies become more imperative, objective and \n\ninterdisciplinary, studies are necessary to understand the ecological boundaries of its \n\necosystems, in order to protect \u2013 and conserve \u2013 its resources (Bonetti et al., 2004). Therefore, \n\nit is essential to realize how ecosystems function, since this type of information is crucial in the \n\nelaboration of conservation strategies (Pagliosa and Barbosa, 2006). \n\nThe benthic environment is a fundamental compartment within any aquatic ecosystem. \n\nBottom sediments constitute a source of nutrients for the water column above having an \n\nimportant position in the benthic-pelagic coupling (J\u00f8rgensen, 1996; Venturini et al., 2004). \n\nThere, benthic organisms alter the physical and chemical conditions at the sediment-water \n\ninterface, promote the decomposition of organic matter, recycle nutrients for photosynthesis and \n\ntransfer energy to other food-web components (Gaston et al., 1998). Therefore, they may be \n\nregarded better pollution indicators than the instantaneous water quality measurements \n\n(Nalesso et al., 2005). \n\nBenthic faunal organisms are considered excellent tools to monitor the environmental \n\nhealth of estuaries (Caeiro et al., 2005). Among them, macrobenthic communities provide an \n\nideal measure of its response to disturbance (natural or man-induced), which made them known \n\nas effective indicators of pollution impacts in estuarine ecosystems (Engle et al., 1994; \n\nWeisberg et al., 1997; Borja et al., 2000). Their advantages as pollution indicators may be \n\npointed out: (i) rapidly response to anthropogenic and natural stress in both spatial and \n\ntemporal scales (Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978; Dauer, 1993; Fleischer et al., 2007); (ii) \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n2\n\nrestricted mobility avoiding unfavorable conditions on water/sediment (Weisberg et al., 1997; \n\nBorja et al., 2003a; Reiss and Kr\u00f6nche 2005); (iii) important function in cycling nutrients and \n\nmaterials between the underlying sediments and the overlying water column (Borja et al., \n\n2003a); and (iv) taxonomic diversity that can usually be classified into different functional \n\nresponse groups (Smith et al., 2001). \n\nThe biological integrity of macrobenthic communities had traditionally been \n\ncharacterized by measures of abundance, diversity, or the presence of pollution indicators \n\n(Engle et al., 1994) since disturbances promote changes on community structure. The analysis \n\nof changes in these communities, using univariate and multivariate methods has taken an \n\nimportant part in the assessment and monitoring of marine and coastal environments (Warwick \n\nand Clarke, 1993; Muniz et al., 2005). Single community attribute measures or individual-\n\nspecies data combinations, including species diversity, evenness or abundance/biomass ratios \n\nare used to sum up data beyond the level of individual species (Caeiro et al., 2005), however \n\nthese measures have proven to be of not great help for estuarine environments monitoring \n\nwhich have highly variable natural conditions (Engle et al., 1994). Conversely, multivariate \n\nmethods are more sensitive in characterizing benthic patterns (Warwick and Clarke, 1993), but \n\nthe results obtained are usually too complex to be understood by non-scientists (Smith et al., \n\n2001; Muniz et al., 2005). \n\nIn more recent studies, biotic indices were developed as easily-understood tools of \n\necological changes, which have clear practical application in the achievement of environmental \n\nquality (Borja, 2006). Such indices estimate macrobenthic community disturbance level and \n\nestablish the ecological status of soft-bottom benthos (Weisberg et al., 1997; Borja et al., 2000; \n\nSimboura and Zenetos, 2002; Llans\u00f3 et al., 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2004), in addition, most are \n\nbased in the concept of sensitive/tolerance taxa (Carvalho et al., 2006). According to Diaz et al. \n\n(2004), the majority of indices currently available are designed for use in freshwater streams, \n\nrivers and/or lakes (58%), but a significant number of indices are on hand for the assessment of \n\nestuarine and coastal marine systems (33%). Of these, the scale of applicability ranges from \n\nlocal (Xu et al., 2001) to regional (Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity, B-IBI, Llans\u00f3 et al., 2003) and \n\nglobal (AZTI Marine Biotic Index, AMBI, Borja et al., 2000, 2003a) areas. \n\nOne of the indices extensively applied with good results is the AZTI Marine Biotic Index \n\n\u2013 AMBI (Borja et al., 2000). The index is based on the classification of macrobenthic species in \n\necological groups corresponding to different sensitivity levels, making it suitable to all data sets \n\nincluding the small ones (Bigot et al., 2008). It has been tested under different stress sources \n\nsuch as submarine outfalls, heavy metals, harbour construction, dredging, diffuse pollution \n\n(mines, agriculture) and river inputs (e.g. Borja et al., 2003a,b; Muxika et al., 2003; Muxika et \n\nal., 2005) and has been applied not only in Europe (Borja et al.,,2000; Borja et al., 2003a,b; \n\nMuxika et al., 2003; Salas et al., 2004; Caeiro et al., 2005; Muxika et al., 2005; Albayrak et al., \n\n2006; Carvalho et al., 2006a,b; Sanz-L\u00e1zaro and Marin, 2006; Aguado-Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2007; \n\nBorja et al., 2007; Chainho et al., 2007; Dauvin et al., 2007; Fleischer et al., 2007; Muxika et al., \n\n2007a,b; Pontil et al., 2007; Pravoni et al., 2007; Simboura and Reizopoulou, 2007; Teixeira et \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n3\n\nal., 2007; Zettler et al., 2007; Afli et al., 2008; Blanchet et al., 2008; Munari and Mistri, 2008; \n\nPuente et al., 2008; Simboura and Reizopoulou, 2008; Teixeira et al., 2008a,b; Pinto et al., \n\n2009) but also in Asia (Cai et al., 2003), northern Africa (Bazairi et al., 2005; Bakalem et al., \n\n2009), North America (Borja et al., 2008), South America (Muniz et al., 2005) and the southwest \n\nIndian Ocean (Bigot et al., 2008), allowing correct assessment of the ecosystem\u2019s conditions. \n\nOne negative aspect of the index is that since the list of species was created based on \n\necological characteristics from temperate benthic fauna, the ecological role of one (or more) \n\nspecie(s) may differ with the environmental context and area (Labrune et al., 2006), which \n\nimplies in reviewing the assignment of ecological groups. Moreover, appropriate assignments \n\nare neither necessarily available (Muniz et al., 2005; Flaten et al., 2007) nor easy to achieve \n\noutside European coasts, where AMBI was first developed (Bigot et al., 2008). This index \n\npresents some limitations when the number of species is very low or when studying low-salinity \n\nlocations (e.g. the inner part of estuaries) (see Borja and Muxika, 2005). \n\nBiotic indices have been proposed as synthetic methodologies and its attributes should \n\nbe precision and cost-effectiveness (Pontil et al., 2007), consequently it is important to verify \n\nwhether one of the main source of sampling variation \u2013 specifically sieve mesh-size \u2013 affects \n\nthe accuracy of benthic community based on indices calculation (Pinto et al., 2009). Commonly, \n\n1.0 and 0.5mm sieves are used for macrobenthic pollution monitoring (Eleftheriou and Holme, \n\n1984; Bachelet, 1990; Schlacher and Wooldridge, 1996; Rodrigues et al., 2007) however, most \n\nsurveys have shown that small species associated to organic pollution are usually not retained \n\nby 1.0mm mesh sieve and due to that biased results may arrive from different methodologies \n\n(Thompson et al., 2003; Teixeira et al., 2007). \n\nDespite tropical and subtropical coastal ecosystems comprise more than one third of \n\nworld\u2019s continental shelf area, not only basic information on ecology of soft-bottom benthic \n\ncommunities is still lacking but also their response to disturbance, especially in coastal areas of \n\nsome countries submitted to intense and unplanned anthropogenic activities (Muniz et al., \n\n2005). According to Pagliosa and Barbosa (2006), studies concerning the ecology of soft-\n\nbottom benthic macrofauna communities in estuarine systems in the South America Atlantic \n\ncoast are recent and in most cases there is no historical data or long-term monitoring programs. \n\nBesides, such studies are concentrated in south and southeast coasts, where the impacts on \n\nestuarine systems only have been registered in obvious cases of severe pollution (Venturini et \n\nal., 2004).  \n\nIn Pernambuco State, northeast coast of Brazil, estuarine zones are the most affected \n\nby anthropogenic influences (e.g. sewage, removal of native mangrove forests for sugar-cane \n\nmonocropping, industries such as chlor-alkali, fertilizers, agricultural defensives, paper mills, \n\naluminum, and others) (CPRH, 2006). As a consequence, it is necessary to propose \n\ninstruments and methodologies which permit to express the structural and functional quality of \n\nthe benthic communities in order to achieve sustainability and conservation of these tropical \n\necosystems. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n4\n\nThis study attempted to fill some of the scarcity concerning ecological information of \n\ntropical macrobenthic communities through two chapters, the first one focus on comparative \n\nsurveys of macrobenthos from estuarine areas of Pernambuco and test if particular sieve mesh \n\nsizes and sampling depths alter the interpretation of macrobenthic assemblages\u2019 descriptors; \n\nthe second one intend to examine the efficiency of AMBI to evaluate the environmental quality \n\nof these estuaries. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n5\n\nReferences \n\nAfli, A.; Ayari, R. and Zaabi, S. 2008.

Macrobenthic community structure in tropical estuarine ecosystems \n(Northeast, Brazil): the effect of sieve mesh-size and sampling depth on \nabundance, biomass and composition. \n \n\nI.1. Introduction \n\n The description of the patterns of species distribution, biomass and abundance with \n\naccuracy is crucial, since it provides the basis for most ecological research (Benedetti-Cecchi et \n\nal., 1996). In benthic communities, it can be directly influenced by sampling procedures such as \n\nnumber of samples, taxonomic resolution, sieve screen (Bachelet, 1990; James et al., 1995; \n\nTanaka and Leite, 1998) and sampling depth (Schaffner, 1990; Flach and Heip, 1996). \n\n Sieves mesh-sizes commonly used for macrobenthic studies are 0.5mm and 1.0mm \n\n(Eleftheriou and Holme 1984; James et al., 1995). Depending on the survey\u2019s purpose (e.g. \n\npopulation dynamics studies), it is imperative to determine the adequate sieve size before \n\ninitiating any scale-sampling exercise (Mahadevan and Patton, 1979). In monitoring \n\nprogrammes, the assessment of macrobenthic community structure and productivity is a long \n\nand costly process that involves sorting, identifying and measuring large numbers of small \n\norganisms from the material collected (Gruenert et al., 2007). Therefore, many pollution-\n\nmonitoring studies adopt the 1.0mm sieve as the most cost-effective method for balancing \n\nlogistic constraints while maintaining the capacity to detect ecological changes (Lampadariou et \n\nal., 2005). Nevertheless, sieve efficiency varies with taxonomic group and for individual species \n\nin the same taxonomic group (Rodrigues et al., 2007); moreover, it is known that small species \n\nrelated to organic enrichment are able to pass through the 1.0mm mesh sieve (Schlacher and \n\nWooldridge, 1996a,b; Teixeira et al., 2007), determining the use of finer sieves. Therefore, the \n\nchoice of a particular mesh size may establish the reliability of results and, consequently, the \n\ndetection of an impact (Thompson et al., 2003; Lampadariou et al., 2005).   \n\n Comparative studies on the influence of different sieve sizes on macrobenthos \n\ncomposition have been done especially on communities of temperate marine and coastal areas, \n\nsuch as Mediterranean (Benedetti-Cecchi et al., 1996; Lampadariou et al., 2005, 2008), North \n\nAmerica (Ferraro and Cole, 1990; Ferraro et al., 1994, 2006; Gruenert et al., 2007), Iberian \n\nPeninsula (Rodrigues et al., 2007), Australia (James et al., 1995), South Africa (Schlacher and \n\nWooldridge, 1996a,b)  and Antarctica (Thompson et al., 2003) and also deep-sea zones (Gage \n\net al., 2002). Information concerning the effect of sieves on tropical macrobenthic communities \n\nis still restrict (e.g. macrophytes-associated invertebrate assemblages), face of number and \n\ndiversity of surveys on the theme (Tanaka and Leite, 1998). \n\nThe importance of sediment sampling depth for the macrobenthos community descriptor \n\nis focused in most literature dealing with benthic vertical distribution (Schaffner, 1990; Weston, \n\n1990; Flach and Heip, 1996; Kumar, 1997; Mannino and Montagna, 1997; Flach et al. 1998; \n\nIngole et al., 1999; Wei, 2006). All these surveys showed some trend for abundance (sampling \n\nthe upper centimeters of sediment column corresponded to higher proportion of macrofauna \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n12\n\nindividuals) but not for biomass profiles; in addition, as for sieves\u2019 information, the subject is \n\nmainly explored in temperate areas (and also deep-sea zones) in contrast to tropics (e.g. \n\nGuti\u00e9rrez et al., 2000). \n\nThis study investigates the role of sieve mesh-size and sampling depth on the quality \n\nand interpretation of data obtained, in order to contribute to a better knowledge of such effects \n\nwhen describing distribution and composition of tropical macrobenthic communities. \n\n \n\n \n\nI.2. Material and Methods \n\nI.2.1. Description of studied areas \n\n  The study was undertaken at estuarine areas situated along the 187km coastline of \n\nPernambuco State, Brazil\u2019s northeast (fig.01). Great part of these estuaries is designated as \n\nEnvironmental Protection Area by the State Law n.9.931, December 1986 (Noronha, 2008). \n\n The Santa Cruz Channel constitutes of a U-shaped estuarine channel situated 50 km \n\nnorth from Recife, capital of Pernambuco State. This estuarine system separates the Itamarac\u00e1 \n\nIsland from the mainland; the whole area (730km\u00b2) has an extension of 22 km, variable widths \n\n(of 0.6 to 1.5 km) and depths (from 4-5m to less than 2m). From north to south, the channel \n\nreceives continental influence through a number of rivers (Flores-Montes et al., 2002), being \n\nBotafogo and Igarassu rivers the major freshwater sources (Medeiros and Kjerfve, 1993) and \n\nalso the most polluted (Silva et al., 2003). The region presents high ecological importance \n\n(Murolo et al., 2006), however is exposed to agro-industrial and urban activities, mainly the \n\nsugar cane monoculture and intensive fisheries. Two sites were chosen, one close to the \n\nItapissuma Bridge, named Itapissuma (07\u00b046\u201931.20\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b053\u201926.76\u2019\u2019W), and the other, more \n\nto the north, Sta Cruz Channel (07\u00b046\u201913.12\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b052\u201958.19\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02A). \n\nThe Paripe river site (07\u00b048\u201938.76\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b051\u201923.28\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02A) is located in \n\nsouthern Itamarac\u00e1 Island; the river has 4km of extension and 1.6km length. The mangrove is \n\ncomposed by Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia schaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa and \n\nConocarpus erectus (the last three in smaller proportion). The anthropic action is still at a \n\nminimum, the local population living basically of subsistence agriculture and fishing (Santos and \n\nCoelho, 2001). \n\nThe Timb\u00f3 river site (07\u00b051\u201918.72\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b050\u201933.96\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02B) is located in the \n\nnorth coast of Pernambuco, about 35km from Recife. The hydrographic basin comprises \n\n92.46km\u00b2, representing 6.8% of the north coast; its depth ranges from 2 to 8m (Figueiredo et al., \n\n2007). The estuarine area exhibits expressive mangrove vegetation and for a long period was \n\nconsidered as non-polluted (Costa and Mac\u00eado, 1989). Nowadays, it is under strong \n\nanthropogenic pressure as a result of intensive fishery activities, domestic sewage and \n\nindustrial effluents (mainly steel mill and textile) and tourism (Grego et al., 2004).  \n\nThe Paratibe river site (07\u00b057\u201937.44\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b049\u201948.54\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02B) is situated \n\nbetween Paulista and Olinda cities, in the north coast of Pernambuco, about 15km from Recife. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n13\n\nThe hydrographic basin occupies 118.54km\u00b2 and a total extension of 16km (Pereira et al., \n\n2007). The estuarine area was relatively reduced as a consequence of rapid human occupation \n\nand mangrove deforestation (CPRH, 2006). Other sources of pollution consist of hospital and \n\nindustrial effluents, domestic sewage (Pereira et al., 2007) and also slaughterhouse (CPRH, \n\n2006). \n\n The Capibaribe river site (08\u00b03\u201952.98\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b052\u201927.06\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02C) lies on the coast of \n\nRecife. The hydrographic basin comprises 7716km\u00b2; maximum depth 8m; tidal entry around \n\n15km from the Atlantic Ocean. Water temperature ranges from 26.2\u00b0C (rainy season) to 31\u00b0C \n\n(dry season); salinity varies considerably (0.05 to 36.0); surface and bottom dissolved oxygen \n\nsaturation ranges from supersaturation to very low levels, with significant oxygen depletion \n\nduring low tide (Travassos et al., 1993). Extensive mangrove areas have been destroyed, even \n\nthough small patches of Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia \n\nschaueriana can be found (Paranagu\u00e1 et al., 2005).  This estuarine system is eutrophic: water \n\ntemperature and nutrient inputs from direct sewage effluents stimulate algal and bacterial \n\ngrowths. Discharges into the river include wastes from small industries (milk, detergents, soap, \n\nand leather, among others), inputs from polluted tributaries, namely Tejipi\u00f3, Jord\u00e3o, Pina and \n\nBeberibe rivers as well as direct sewage outfalls (Fernandes et al., 1999). \n\n The Pina Basin is a complex estuarine area placed at the coast of Recife and separated \n\nfrom the ocean by a natural reef dyke, into which discharge the south arm of Capibaribe, \n\nTejipi\u00f3, Jiqui\u00e1, Jord\u00e3o and Pina rivers (CPRH, 2006). The basin is about 3.6km with a total area \n\nof 2.02km\u00b2. Salinity varies from 0.4 to 37.0 and water temperature from 27\u00baC to 32\u00baC. Because \n\nof the constant influx of nutrients from the rivers (especially domestic sewage), the Pina basin is \n\nhypereutrophic and organically polluted; even though its great biological potential has been \n\nexploited by the low-income population (Sommerfield et al., 2003). Two sites were selected, \n\nnamed Pina Basin1 (08\u00b04\u201938.7\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b052\u201929.7\u2019\u2019W) and Pina Basin2 (08\u00b05\u201927.0\u2019\u2019S and \n\n34\u00b053\u201911.64\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02C). \n\nThe Jaboat\u00e3o river site (08\u00b014\u201924.43\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b056\u201943.20\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02D) is placed about \n\n20km from Recife, in the south coast of Pernambuco. The river is part of a hydrographic basin \n\nwith 413km\u00b2 in area and 75km in length. Due to the fact of its basin draining six great cities, the \n\nriver receives high load of pollutants such as untreated sewage, mill industry and cellulose \n\nmanufacture (Souza and Tundisi, 2003). \n\n The Pirapama river site (08\u00b014\u201935.52\u2019\u2019S and 34\u00b056\u201946.80\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02D) is also in the \n\nsouth coast of Pernambuco; together with Jaboat\u00e3o river and its tributaries they formed the \n\n\u201cBarra das Jangadas\u201d estuarine system, being considered one of the major estuarine systems \n\nof Pernambuco State (Branco, 2001). According to Cavalcanti et al. (2008), the development of \n\nindustries (especially sugar cane mills) and irregular human occupation along the margins \n\nconstitute the main problems of its hydrographic basin (about 600km\u00b2 and 70km length).  \n\n The estuaries of rivers Ipojuca and Merepe jointly with Tatuoca and Massangana used \n\nto discharge in the Suape Bay system (south coast of Pernambuco). However, with the \n\nimplementation of an Industrial Port Complex (created in 1980) the two former rivers had their \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n14\n\nconnection with the bay interrupted by the intensive embankment to build the port (Silva et al., \n\n2004a). As a result, more than 600 hectares of mangrove have been deforested, affecting the \n\necological balance and resilience of several species (Koening et al., 2002). One site was \n\nchosen in the junction of these rivers, named Ipojuca-Merepe (08\u00b024\u201939.66\u2019\u2019S and \n\n34\u00b058\u201928.62\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02E). \n\nMaraca\u00edpe river site (08\u00b032\u201921.42\u2019\u2019S and 35\u00b000\u201921.72\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02E) lies on Ipojuca city, \n\nin the south coast of Pernambuco. This area, formed by dense forests of Laguncularia \n\nracemosa, has been exploited especially by ecotourism (Mendon\u00e7a and Almeida-Cortez, 2007). \n\n Ariquind\u00e1 river site (08\u00b041\u201922.74\u2019\u2019S and 35\u00b006\u201908.22\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02F) is placed nearly \n\nCarneiros beach, also in the south coast of Pernambuco (Silva et al. 2004b). The river \n\nintegrates the estuarine system of Rio Formoso which presents a great level of preservation, \n\ndespite some agricultural enterprises, tourism activities and lack of sanitation in the urban \n\ncenters from the region (Medeiros, 2005). \n\nMamucabas river site (08\u00b046\u201941.81\u2019\u2019S and 35\u00b006\u201927.46\u2019\u2019W) (fig.02F) stands in \n\nTamandar\u00e9 city, about 110km from Recife, in the south coast of Pernambuco. The river (>30km \n\nof extension) originates in the interior of the Saltinho Biological Reserve (15,5km from \n\nTamandar\u00e9 bay), borders its urban area and crosses either agricultural or forested areas \n\n(Ara\u00fajo and Costa, 2006). \n\n \n \nI.2.2. Sampling design \n\nSamples for geochemical variables and macrofauna were collected at fourteen sites in \n\nOctober 2007. Preliminary investigations were undertaken in these estuarine areas, being the \n\nsites chosen with base on sediment characteristics, water salinity and level of disturbance. In \n\neach site, five benthic quantitative replicates for macrofauna analyses were sampled with a \n\ncylindrical corer (area: 40.71cm\u00b2, depth: 20cm), and separated in two layers: top (0-10cm) and \n\nbottom (10-20cm). All biological samples were preserved in 10% formaldehyde. Subsequently, \n\nsamples from both layers were washed through 1.0 and 0.5mm mesh sieves and the material \n\nretained in each one was fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with Rose Bengal. Sorting and \n\ncounting were performed under stereomicroscope and specimens were identified to the lowest \n\npossible taxonomic level. \n\nTotal abundance and biomass per replicate were calculated for the macrofauna retained \n\non 1.0mm mesh sieve and combined sieves (1.0+0.5mm), in top layer (0-10cm) and combined \n\nlayers (0-20cm) and results were compared for mesh-sieve (1.0mm x combined sieves) and \n\nsampling depth (0-10cm x 0-20cm) effects. For biomass, organisms were preserved in \n\nformaldehyde prior to weighting (wet weight); values were averaged into major taxonomic \n\ngroups and then estimated as ash-free dry weight (g AFDW) from conversion factors according \n\nto Ricciardi and Bourget (1998). For the polychaete Laeonereis sp., however, the biomass (in \n\nAFDW) was obtained by measuring the 5th setiger diameter, in accordance with the growth \n\nmodels established by Flor\u00eancio (2000). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n15\n\nAs for macrofauna, five replicates were obtained for sediment environmental \n\ndescriptors, which include, granulometry, organic matter, nutrients-total-N (cylindrical corer - \n\narea: 16.62cm\u00b2, depth: 2cm) and redox potential (Eh), measured in field, in top (~2cm) and \n\nbottom (~20cm) layers. Microphytobenthos was also sampled at each site, with a smaller corer \n\n(area: 1.13cm\u00b2, depth: 2cm). One single measure was carried out for water variables: salinity \n\nand ammonia-N. All methodologies applied to determine such parameters are presented in \n\ntable 01: \n\n \nTable 01.

Statistical analysis \n\nAnalyses were performed using univariate and multivariate techniques. The distribution \n\nand composition of macrobenthic communities in relation to mesh sieve and sampling depth \n\nwere ascribed in terms of abundance (N), biomass (g AFDW) and density (individuals/m\u00b2). \n\nUnivariate indices such as number of species (S), Shannon diversity index (H\u2019 loge) and \n\nevenness (J\u2019) were also presented using the PRIMER v6.0 software package (Clarke and \n\nGorley, 2006). \n\n Analysis of Variance (two-way ANOVA) was carried out to determine whether diversity \n\n(as measured by Hill\u2019s diversity index N1 or exp=H\u2019) varied with the sieves (1.0mm x combined \n\nsieves) and also with the sampling depths (0-10cm x 0-20cm) in the macrobenthic samples. N1 \n\nvalues were chosen instead of H\u2019 by the fact that the Hill\u2019s index seems to allow a better \n\ndistribution of diversity values when compared to Shannon index, which \u201cis so narrowly \n\nconstrained in most circumstances can make interpretation difficult\u201d (Magurran, 2004). Results \n\nfor each interaction (mesh-sieves x sites and sampling depths x sites) were treated separately. \n\nIn order to check the assumption of homoscedasticity, Bartlett\u2019s tests were applied.   When \n\nsignificant differences among sites in relation to each factor (sieves/sampling depths) were \n\nfound, a posteriori comparisons were performed using LSD tests (Sokal and Rohlf, 1997).  The \n\nanalyses of variance, Bartlett\u2019s and LSD tests were calculated using STATISTICA v5.0 \n\ncomputer program.   \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n16\n\nFor macrofauna comparison and descriptive purposes, multivariate techniques followed \n\nthe standard methods according to Clarke and Warwick (1994). In order to reduce the clumping \n\neffect of some numerically dominant species, abundances were weighted by means of \n\ndispersion index (Di) of each species per sample (Clarke et al., 2006). Weighted abundance \n\ndata were log (x+1) transformed and resemblances were calculated by Bray-Curtis similarity \n\nmeasure. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and Analysis of Similarity (two-way ANOSIM) were \n\nused to plot differences among sites for quantitative data of macrofauna and to test for \u201cmesh-\n\nsieve\u201d and \u201csampling depth\u201d factors effects (also separately) respectively. When significant \n\ndifferences among sites for the macrobenthos communities in relation to each factor \n\n(sieves/sampling depths) were found, the Similarity Percentages procedure (two-way SIMPER) \n\n(Clarke, 1993) was applied to point out the taxa which contribute to distinguish each factor \n\nwithin the sites. MDS, ANOSIM and SIMPER were also conducted with PRIMER v6.0 software \n\n(Clarke and Gorley, 2006). Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association \n\nbetween sedimentological parameters and \u201cchanges\u201d in the community structure due to the \n\nfactors (only when there were significant differences). To verify these \u201cchanges\u201d the following \n\nprocedure was made: for each factor (sieves/sampling depths), the similarity matrix was \n\nobtained and values of similarity for each replicate (from each site) between factor levels \n\n(sieves: \u201c1.0mm\u201d and \u201ccombined sieves\u201d/ sampling depths: \u201c0-10cm\u201d and \u201c0-20cm\u201d) were \n\nextracted from the matrix. After that, the average dissimilarity for each site was calculated, being \n\nused in Pearson correlation analysis (Average Dissimilarity = 100-Average Similarity). Pearson \n\ncorrelation analysis was performed in BIOESTAT v5.0 (Ayres et al., 2007).  \n\nAll statistics statements were based on a significance level of ? = 5%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 01.

Results  \n\nI.3.1. Environmental data \n\n The fourteen sites presented variations in all abiotic data (tab.02): Salinity values \n\nranged between 8 (in Mamucabas) and 40 psu (in Maraca\u00edpe), being the majority of sites \n\nsampled in polyhaline/euhaline zones. Nitrogenous compounds were differently distributed in \n\nwater and sediment: Paratibe and Jaboat\u00e3o showed high ammonia-N values in their waters \n\nwhile, in sediment, the Total-N concentrations were superior in Pina Basin2 and Sta Cruz \n\nChannel. Although the sand fraction have predominated in sediment composition of all sites, the \n\nfine fraction (%silt-clay) was important in Timb\u00f3 estuary; despite that, sediment properties \n\n(represented as median grain size) presented homogeneous distribution among sites.

Despite their recognized numerical \n\ndominance in meiobenthos, Nematoda retained in \u201cmacrobenthic sieves\u201d (1.0+0.5mm) were \n\nresponsible for almost 50% of Paripe and Sta Cruz Channel community abundances; besides, \n\nthe presence of this taxon was registered in Paratibe, Capibaribe, Pina Basin1, Jaboat\u00e3o, \n\nPirapama and Mamucabas only with the use of the finer mesh sieve. The relative contribution of \n\ntaxonomic groups within each site differed depending on the considered mesh size especially in \n\nIpojuca-Merepe and Maraca\u00edpe, where the high dominance of Polychaeta observed in 1.0mm \n\nwas replaced by Oligochaeta with the combined sieves (fig.04).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n23\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 04.

In general, densities ranged from three to five times more for both sieves compared \n\nto 1.0mm, except from Pina Basin1, where the difference increased almost by an order of \n\nmagnitude. Considering the studied areas, it was observed that most macrobenthic animals in \n\ncombined sieves were mainly concentrated in four sites: Paripe (12.85%), Timb\u00f3 (12.56%), \n\nParatibe (11.73%) and Capibaribe (11.45%). In these areas, densities attained values equal or \n\nsuperior to 80,000 ind/m\u00b2; by contrast, Ariquind\u00e1 was the only estuary that registered less than \n\n10,000 ind./m\u00b2 (fig.05A).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 05A.

Discussion \n\n In this study, different procedures for describing spatial structure patterns of tropical \n\nestuarine macrobenthos were tested and revealed that biological material processed with \n\ndifferent mesh sizes and sampling depths can influence estimates of parameters from these \n\ncommunities. Indeed, the use of 1.0mm or 0.5mm mesh had a more significant effect on \n\ndistribution rather than composition of taxa. In both sieves, macrobenthic communities from the \n\nstudied areas were numerically dominated by annelids \u2013 particularly polychaetes \u2013 which is \n\ncommonly the more abundant and important taxon in tropical and subtropical estuarine \n\nmacrofauna, as reported by several authors (Maurer and Vargas, 1984; Alongi, 1990; Frouin, \n\n2000; Dittmann, 2001; Paiva, 2001; Ingole et al., 2002; Lancelloti and Sotz, 2004; Bigot et al., \n\n2006; Jayaraj et al., 2008). Besides, the presence of the polychaetes Streblospio sp., \n\nLaeonereis sp., Capitella sp. and Mediomastus sp. together with Tubificidae oligochaetes and \n\nnematodes were shown to be typical of estuarine environments in Brazilian estuaries (e.g. \n\nBemvenuti et al., 2003; Nalesso et al., 2005; Pagliosa and Barbosa, 2006; Rosa-Filho et al., \n\n2006; Barros et al., 2008). \n\n Conversely, biomass data showed that Mollusca dominated the communities\u2019 \n\ncomposition. Biomass values derived from both sieve fractions within sites were similar, but the \n\noccurrence of deep burrowing adults of Macoma sp., Lucina sp. and Anomalocardia brasiliana \n\nin the 10-20cm stratum made important the differences between the sampling depths in some \n\nareas. Moreover, these species not only represented together less than 1% of total abundance \n\n(30 individuals), but they also accounted for over than 60% of total biomass, which indicated \n\nthat macrofauna was clearly dominated in numbers by small specimens.  \n\n Some studies have shown that, for comparison of communities with univariate indices, \n\ndifferences in species richness and diversity can be found between samples processed with \n\n1.0mm and 0.5mm (Bachelet, 1990; Tanaka and Leite, 1998). In Pernambuco estuaries, the \n\n1.0mm mesh retained more than 70% of species richness and 63% of diversity values, \n\nindicating that this is not a general trend. Besides, other authors suggest that the mesh size \n\nused would not interfere, as both sieves would sample similarly in terms of species composition \n\n(James et al., 1995; Schlacher and Wooldridge, 1996b).  \n\n Considering the mesh efficiencies for macrobenthos sampling, the extra information \n\nadded by sieving with both mesh sizes (1.0+0.5mm) had importance only for total abundance. \n\nRetention efficiency had been reported for 1.0mm sieve when compared to abundances \n\nretained by the combination of sieves (tab.05) and will diverge depending on the geographic \n\narea, habitat and benthic assemblage sampled.  \n\n Regardless of study area or benthic samples, comparative surveys on retention \n\nefficiency indicate that crustaceans, polychaetes and bivalves usually show decreasing \n\nselection, in this order, for the same mesh sieve (Bachelet, 1990; Tanaka and Leite, 1998; \n\nLampadariou et al., 2005). In this study, while the few crustaceans present (<10 individuals) \n\nwere observed in the 1.0mm sieve, the bivalves (which corresponded to 92% of mollusks) were \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n34\n\nmore retained in this sieve rather than polychaetes, following a different order of selection \n\n(crustaceans>bivalves>polychaetes). Such results are in accordance with those from Rodrigues \n\net al. (2007) for Tagus estuary (Portugal), where high abundance of Streblospio shrubsolii was \n\nresponsible for polychaetes\u2019 lower retention in 1.0mm sieve. In the present study, the same \n\noccurred due to the species of Streblospio sp., Capitella sp., Mediomastus sp. and juveniles of \n\nLaeonereis sp.  \n\n \nTable 05.

Other \n\nobservations seem to corroborate the above findings (e.g. James et al., 1995; Schlacher and \n\nWooldridge, 1996b; Gage et al., 2002; Rodrigues et al., 2007). In some cases, given that \n\nrelatively higher costs are associated with finer screens, sampling protocols employing 1.0mm \n\nsieves can be more cost-effective for characterizing the macrobenthic community (Ferraro et al. \n\n1994, 2006). \n\n On the other hand, the macrobenthic communities were mainly composed by smaller \n\nand pollution indicator species, thus it is possible that losses of information necessary to detect \n\nimpacts in pollution assessment would occur if 1.0mm sieve was used instead of a 0.5mm. \n\nConsidering that most sites presented evidence of disturbance (from different sources, see \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n35\n\ndescription of studied areas in the Material and Methods section), and that the sediment \n\nparameters (organic matter, total-N and microphytobenthos biomass) selected in the correlation \n\nanalyses are frequently associated to organic enrichment conditions, it becomes fundamental \n\nusing the material retained in the 0.5mm sieve in studies focusing this theme. \n\n Concerning the sampling depth, the importance of the upper centimeter layers for the \n\ntaxa composition and abundance structure of benthic communities is widely reported (Weston, \n\n1990; Flach and Heip, 1996; Dauwe et al., 1998; Flach et al., 1998; Ingole et al., 1999; Wei, \n\n2006). In fact, over 90% of the macrofauna specimens and taxa were presented in top layer (0-\n\n10cm). Flach and Heip (1996) and Flach et al. (1998) showed that in deep-sea areas of NE \n\nAtlantic, macrobenthic fauna concentrated in the first centimeter (40-80% and 25-59%, \n\nrespectively); Guti\u00e9rrez et al (2000) observed in the continental shelf of Central Chile that 40-\n\n80% of macrofauna was in 0-2cm stratum while 20-40%, in 2-5cm. In estuaries, the proportion \n\ncan be even higher: Mannino and Montagna (1997) pointed out in Nueces estuary (USA) that \n\nmore than 70% of total abundance was in the 0-5cm stratum while Rodrigues et al. (2007) \n\nregistered 87% in Tagus estuary (Portugal).  \n\n A different pattern was shown in the vertical profile for total biomass, which presented \n\nvariations in terms of distribution within the sediment strata among areas. In five sites, highest \n\nbiomass values (63 to 94%) were found bellow the first 10cm, as a result of large deep-dwelling \n\nbivalves, sipunculans and phoronides. In these areas, sampling only the upper centimeters of \n\nsediment would have missed many large deep-burrowing species that are few in number, but \n\naccount for most of the total biomass. Weston (1990) demonstrated the same dilemma: 90% of \n\nthe macrofauna individuals were found in the 0 to 5cm stratum, but 40 to 90% of the biomass \n\nwas situated in 5-20cm. \n\n The importance of estimation total macrobenthic biomass must be taken into account \n\nfor pollution-monitoring programmes since most methods for detecting anthropogenic stress \n\ninclude those centered on the primary community structural variables (abundance, species \n\nrichness and biomass) and its derivation, such as diversity indices, abundance (A/S) and \n\nbiomass (B/A) ratios (Elliot and Quintino, 2007).  Warwick (1986) had suggested that the \n\nrelation between species abundance and species biomass curves can show pollution-induced \n\ncondition, known as Abundance-Biomass-Comparisons (or ABC curves). According to Dauer \n\n(1993), healthy benthic communities can be characterized by high biomass estimates, \n\ndominated by long-lived, often deep-dwelling (e.g. bivalve mollusks, Maldanidae polychaetes, \n\netc.) species and this might indicate a past history of good water/sediment quality situations. \n\nRecently, Lampadariou et al. (2008) proposed the size fraction of macrofaunal biomass \n\n(Biomass Fractionation Index \u2013 BFI) as a monitoring tool to discriminate between impacted and \n\nunimpacted sites. This index has advantage in relation to the above metrics since it \n\nincorporated measures of total macrofaunal biomass rather than biomass of specific (i.e. \n\nsensitive or non-sensitive to disturbance) taxa/groups, although further studies are still \n\nnecessary.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n36\n\n Macrofauna descriptors (diversity and community structure) identified for total fauna (0-\n\n20cm) were similar to those obtained with the analyses (ANOVA, ANOSIM and MDS) based \n\nonly on the top layer (0-10cm). These results support the importance of top layer for the taxa \n\ncomposition and abundance structure of the benthic community, however, for studies based on \n\nbiomass, the inclusion of the bottom layer seems to be essential (Rodrigues et al., 2007).  \n\n The soft-bottom macrobenthic communities investigated in this study showed that even \n\nif sampling with a 1.0mm mesh appears to be adequate to describe biota\u2019s composition (based \n\non some sort of cost-benefit analysis), in these estuaries - where macrofauna is mostly \n\ncomposed by small specimens - the use of the 0.5mm sieve will permit a more accurate \n\ninterpretation of the data. In addition, for taxa composition and abundance, the top layer is \n\nclearly the most important whereas for biomass the bottom layer should be considered. \n\n \n \n\nI.5. Conclusion \n\n The requirement for adequate description of benthic communities attributes \n\n(abundance, biomass, diversity) has serious implications in making a reasonable assessment of \n\nenvironmental impacts and, consequently, in monitoring programmes. Although the present \n\nstudy is based on a single sampling period and spatially limited, the results shows the influence \n\nof both mesh-sieve and sampling depth in characterizing the tropical estuarine macrofauna. It \n\nmust be highlighted that the investigator needs to decide which and how many response \n\nmeasures will be taken in order to achieve a particular objective. No single protocol will perform \n\noptimally for all geographic areas, habitat types and communities, thus, considerable attention \n\nshould be devoted to methodological planning, including the criteria of choosing a particular \n\nsieve or sampling depth as for obtaining better accurate information on ecological interpretation \n\nof biota and ecosystems. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n37\n\nI.6.

Macrobenthic communities in estuarine health assessment on \ntropical areas (Northeast, Brazil): applying the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). \n \n\nII.1. Introduction \n\n Estuarine and coastal environments are known by their importance in terms of \n\ncomplexity and biodiversity; however, human activities (pollution, tourism, commercial fisheries, \n\neutrophication, sediment discharges, sand extraction and marine transport) have been affecting, \n\ndirectly or indirectly, the biodiversity of these ecosystems on a worldwide-scale (Dauer et al., \n\n2000; Ellingsen, 2001; Kimerer, 2002; Andersen et al., 2006; Borja, 2006; Borja and Dauer, \n\n2008).  \n\n The study of marine benthic communities allows the assessment of environmental \n\nhealth of marine and coastal areas (Muniz et al., 2005). Macrobenthic infauna has a \n\nfundamental role on sediment processes, providing an important measure of the response of a \n\ncommunity to environmental perturbations (Warwick, 1986; Engle et al., 1994; Bald\u00f3 et al., \n\n1999; Frouin, 2000; Ysebaert and Herman, 2002; Figueroa et al., 2003) and exhibiting the \n\ngreatest potential for monitoring conditions in a site (Pagola-Carte et al., 2002). Given its \n\ninherent ability of incorporating sediment quality (MacFarlane and Booth, 2001; Quintino et al., \n\n2006), a growing number of tools and methods relies on macrobenthic attributes such as \n\nspecies composition, abundance (Labrune et al., 2006), biomass (Lampadariou et al., 2008) \n\nand ecological function (Pearson, 2001).  \n\n Within this context, biotic indices are very useful tools in decision-making processes \n\n(Pinto et al., 2009) since they synthesize complex scientific data into the most straightforward \n\nand easy interpretation (Labrune et al., 2006; Chainho et al., 2007; Pontil et al., 2007). One of \n\nthem, AZTI Marine Biotic Index \u2013 AMBI, developed by Borja et al., (2000), is based upon the \n\nproportion of species gathered into sensitivity groups to increasing levels of disturbance, from \n\nvery sensitive to opportunistic (Borja et al., 2008). Although this index was designed to assess \n\nthe ecological quality of European water ecosystems, its applicability has extended to other \n\ngeographic areas as Asia (Cai et al., 2003), northern Africa (Bazairi et al., 2005; Bakalem et al., \n\n2009), North America (Borja et al., 2008), South America (Muniz et al., 2005) and southwest \n\nIndian Ocean (Bigot et al., 2008), allowing correct evaluation of the ecosystem\u2019s conditions. \n\n The use of biotic indices presents limitations, mainly inside coastal and estuarine \n\necosystems of tropical and subtropical areas, where basic information regarding ecological \n\ncharacteristic of soft-bottom macrobenthic communities is still scarce (Frouin, 2000; Gray, 2002; \n\nMuniz et al., 2005; Bigot et al., 2008). The ecology of soft-bottom benthic macrofauna \n\ncommunities in estuarine systems on the Atlantic coast of South America is recent and without \n\nprevious data or long-term monitoring programs (Pagliosa and Barbosa, 2006). Besides, they \n\nhave been thoroughly concentrated in the south and southeast coasts (subtropical and \n\ntemperate areas), where the impacts on estuarine systems only have been registered in \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n44\n\nobvious cases of severe pollution (Venturini et al., 2004), so extensive gaps in the north and \n\nnortheast regions remain (Couto et al., 2003). \n\nIn Pernambuco State, northeast coast of Brazil, estuarine zones are the most affected \n\nby anthropogenic influences (e.g. sewage, removal of native mangrove forests for sugar-cane \n\nmonocropping, industries such as chlor-alkali, fertilizers, agricultural defensives, paper mills, \n\naluminum, and others) (CPRH, 2006). As a consequence, it is necessary to propose \n\ninstruments and methodologies which permit to express the structural and functional quality of \n\nthe benthic communities in order to achieve sustainability and conservation of these tropical \n\necosystems. \n\n The present study aimed to examine the AMBI efficiency to evaluate with adequacy and \n\naccuracy the environmental and ecological status of the estuarine ecosystems of Pernambuco \n\nin view of extending its use to other tropical areas.  The comparison between urbanized and \n\nrelatively conserved areas may allow recognizing the ecological performance of AMBI in \n\nestuaries with non-intense levels of pollution or where there is a lack of historical data. This \n\nwork also assessed among environmental variables those which best reflect the responses of \n\nmacrobenthic communities to anthropogenic stressors and tested the AMBI index classification \n\ndependence on sieve-mesh (1.0mm and 0.5mm) and sampling depth (0-10cm and 0-20cm).  \n\n \n \n\nII.2. Material and Methods  \n\nII.2.1. Studied areas and sampling design \n\n The same fourteen sites presented in Chapter 01 (see pages 17 and 18) were selected in \n\norder to evaluate their ecological condition and integrity. Although most of these estuaries are \n\ndefined as Environmental Protection Areas (through the State Law n.9.931, December 1986; \n\nNoronha, 2008), they are subjected to different sources (tab.01), as shown by monitoring \n\nreports (CPRH, 2006).  \n\nThe sampling procedure, number of replicates collected for environmental variables, \n\nmicrophytobenthos and macrofauna as well as the methods applied for abiotic parameters \n\nanalyses followed the descriptions in Chapter 01 (see tab.02 and 03). Granulometric \n\ncomposition was determined according to Wentworth scale (1922): coarse sand (0.5mm); \n\nmedium sand (0.25mm); fine sand (0.125mm); very fine sand (0.062mm) and mud (<0.062mm).  \n\nFor macrofauna, the total abundance per replicate was used to examine AMBI \n\nefficiency; afterwards, abundance was separated by sieve-mesh (1.0mm and 1.0+0.5mm or \n\ncombined sieves) and sampling depth (0-10cm and 0-20cm) to test the contribution of these \n\nfactors for the index diagnosis.  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n45\n\nTable 01.

This index relies on the distribution of individual \n\nabundances of the soft-bottom communities into five ecological groups (EG) according to a \n\ngradient of pollution: Ecological group I (EGI) - Species very sensitive to organic enrichment and \n\npresent under unpolluted conditions; Ecological group II (EGII) - Species indifferent to \n\nenrichment, always present in low densities with non-significant variations with time; Ecological \n\ngroup III (EGIII) - Species tolerant to excess organic matter enrichment. Populations stimulated \n\nby slight unbalanced situations; Ecological group IV (EGIV) - Second-order opportunistic species \n\n(slight to pronounced unbalanced situations); Ecological group V (EGV) - First-order \n\nopportunistic species (pronounced unbalanced situations). \n\n AMBI values (also referred as biotic coefficient or BC) are computed as the sum of \n\nproducts of the proportion of each ecological group by an arbitrary value (0; 1.5; 3; 4.5; 6) \n\nattributed to each EG (Bigot et al., 2008) and vary continuously from 0 (undisturbed) to 6 \n\n(extremely disturbed)(tab. 04): \n\n \n\n \n In the present study, AMBI was computed for each individual replicate and then \n\naveraged for each site as recommended by Borja et al. (2003), Borja and Muxika (2005a), \n\nMuniz et al. (2005) and Bigot et al. (2008). The assignment of the identified species into one of \n\nthe five ecological groups proposed by the index was based upon the list available in the AMBI \n\nv.4.0 program (http://www.azti.es). Species not considered in the list or for which the \n\nclassification was not in accordance with knowledge on their ecological distribution for tropical \n\nareas were assigned or re-assigned to an EG based on pollution condition monitoring reports of \n\nPernambuco estuaries (CPRH, 2006), on literature about local ecological characteristics of \n\nAMBI = 1/100 x (0 x %EGI + 1.5 x %EGII + 3 x %EGIII + 4.5 x %EGIV + 6 x %EGV) \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n47\n\nmacrobenthic communities of these ecosystems (e.g. Silva, 2003; Carvalho, 2004; Lima, 2006; \n\nBotter-Carvalho, 2007; Valen\u00e7a, 2007) and on IndVal coefficient methodology (see below). \n\n \nTable 04.

Data analysis \n\nFor this study, the following main faunal parameters which could contribute to qualify \n\nthe ecological status of the sites are presented: species richness (S), evenness (J\u2019) and AMBI \n\nindex, the last one computed using the AMBI program (v.4.0). The first two indices results were \n\ndescribed in chapter 01. In order to assess whether species were properly classified and \n\npropose new ecological assignments, before calculating AMBI, the sites were gathered into \n\ngroups considering previous information on their pollution condition (CPRH, 2006) and \n\nenvironmental parameters. The groups of sites resulting from these associations were \n\ncharacterized by their indicator species, through the Indicator Value (IndVal) coefficient, \n\ndeveloped by Dufr\u00eane and Legendre (1997). According to the authors, a species is indicator of \n\na group if it occurs on most of the samples from this group (specificity) and if it is poorly \n\nrepresented on the other groups (fidelity). The IndVal coefficient combines both the species \n\nrelative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the defined groups of sites. The \n\nstatistical significance of the species indicator values was estimated using a random reallocation \n\nprocedure (1000 randomizations) of sites among site groups, through the Monte Carlo test, thus \n\na species is considered as a group indicator if the results are significant to a level of 0.05 \n\n(Zintzen et al., 2008). In general, groups are defined by categorical environmental parameters, \n\ndisturbance levels, experimental treatments or types of habitat (Wetzel et al., 2002). In this \n\nstudy, categorical dissolved oxygen and disturbance levels were adopted, separating the sites \n\ninto two groups: (1) undisturbed or low disturbance conditions, where dissolved oxygen values \n\nwere superior to 5.0mg/L (reference concentration for Brazilian\u2019s estuarine waters, according to \n\nCONAMA Resolution n.357/2005) and (2) medium to high disturbance conditions, where \n\ndissolved oxygen values were lower than 5.0mg/L. The IndVal coefficient was calculated using \n\nthe PC-ORD v.4.0 Windows program (McCune and Mefford, 1999). \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n48\n\nOn the basis of the macrofaunal parameters (AMBI index, S and J\u2019), Multidimensional \n\nscaling (MDS) and Analysis of Similarity (one-way ANOSIM) were used to point out differences \n\namong sites in view of the ecological quality of macrobenthic community (see AMBI \n\nclassification of benthic community health, tab.04). Simultaneously, the BEST/BIOENV routine \n\nwas performed to associate environmental variables to the set of indices (AMBI, species \n\nrichness and evenness), while Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient was carried out in order \n\nto determine correlations between each index and the abiotic variables. To account for multiple \n\nsimultaneous Spearman\u2019s rank correlations, Bonferroni correction was applied and results were \n\nsignificant at p<0.0045. The multivariate analyses (MDS, ANOSIM and BEST/BIOENV) were \n\nperformed with PRIMER v6.0 software (Clarke and Gorley, 2006) and Spearman\u2019s correlation \n\ncoefficient was calculated using the BIOESTAT v5.0 program (Ayres et al., 2007). \n\nFinally, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test was used to compare results from AMBI \n\nclassification of estuarine systems considering the factors \u201cmesh-sieve\u201d and \u201csampling depth\u201d. \n\nIn this case, the significance level adopted was 0.025, after Bonferroni correction. In addition, a \n\ntwo-tailed t-test was applied to verify the relation between index values found (for mesh-sieve \n\nand sampling depth factors) and the presence or absence of urbanization around these \n\nestuaries. The Wilcoxon test was performed using the STATISTICA v5.0 software and the t-test \n\nwas calculated with the BIOESTAT v5.0 program (Ayres et al., 2007). \n\nAll (but not Wilcoxon or Spearman\u2019s rank correlation) statistics statements were based on \n\na significance level of ? = 5%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n49\n\nII.3.

As for salinity, mean values were akin \n\nto those obtained in the period of macrofauna samplings (October-2007). In most sites, \n\ndissolved oxygen levels were found to be outside the normal limits for estuarine systems \n\n(tab.05); on the other hand, only Pina Basin1 (3.997?mol/L), Jaboat\u00e3o (6.311?mol/L) and \n\nParatibe (7.292?mol/L) presented ammonia-N concentrations (fig.02) higher than the reference \n\nvalue (3.89?mol/L) established by Brazilian laws. Significant correlations were registered \n\nbetween salinity values in October-2007 and both mean temperature (r=0.752; p=0.002) and \n\ndissolved oxygen (r=0.716; p=0.004) averaged along the seasons.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 01.

The very fine sand fraction dominated in Timb\u00f3, Ariquind\u00e1 and \n\nIpojuca-Merepe and the two formers presented high proportion of mud (or silt-clay) fraction. In \n\ncontrast, Capibaribe and Pina Basin2 sediments were represented by coarse sand (fig.03). In \n\nthese sites, surface sediment was characterized by yellow-brown color (probably diatoms) and \n\ngreen (cyanobacteria) color compact mats that might have interfered during the granulometric \n\nanalyses. The algal mats also might contribute to the high chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments \n\nconcentrations observed (fig.04). \n\nSediment presented strongly reduced conditions along sites and the redox potential (Eh) in the \n\nbottom layer (~20cm) was generally more negative than in the surface (~2cm) (fig.05). \n\nA strong correlation between the organic matter content (fig.06) and total-N (fig.07) variables \n\n(r=0.911; p<0.001) in the sediments was registered. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 03.

Ecological group assignments and sites classification \n\nAmong all macrofauna taxa, over 30% were not listed in any ecological group (EG) of \n\nAZTI database, being the majority (79%) ascribed an EG based on the classification for the \n\nsame genus. For the following species, ecological groups were attributed according to AZTI list \n\nfor higher taxonomic levels (>Family): Anomalocardia brasiliana (I), Barantolla sp. (V), \n\nCapitellides sp. (V), Fabrisabella sp. (I), Neomediomastus sp. (V), Pseudobranchiomma sp. (I) \n\nand Timarete sp. (IV). Due to the lack of ecological information for tropical regions, eighteen \n\ntaxa still remained without classification, known as not assigned. \n\n Considering the definition of sites into groups using the variables dissolved oxygen and \n\ndisturbance levels, the Indicator Value (IndVal) coefficient revealed the presence of four \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n54\n\nsignificant indicator species (tab. 06). In terms of ecological interpretation, since these species \n\npresented high indicator values (>50%), they were associated to sensitive and opportunistic \n\ngroups of AMBI (EG I and V, respectively). Consequently, Magelona sp., Megalomma sp. and \n\nSternaspis sp. were reclassified to EG (I) and Streblospio sp., to EG (V).    \n\n \nTable 06. Indicator Value (IndVal) coefficient for significant species related to the categorical \ngroups. Groups: (1) sites undisturbed or low disturbance conditions (dissolved oxygen \nconcentration >5.0mg/L) and (2) sites disturbed (dissolved oxygen concentration&lt;5.0mg/L). \n\nGroup Indicator Species Indicator Value (IV) Significance level (p)%\n\n1 Magelona sp. 66.2 3.1 \n\n1 Megalomma sp. 51.3 4.1 \n\n1 Sternaspis sp. 60.0 2.3 \n\n2 Streblospio sp. 89.1 2.8 \n\n \nAlthough Oligochaeta was not selected as an indicator species by the IndVal coefficient, \n\nthis study suggests its change from ecological group V (first-order opportunistic) to III (tolerant), \n\nin view of the fact that most oligochaetes identified belong to Tubificidae which can be observed \n\nnot only in impacted sites but also at low salinity unimpacted sites within estuaries (see Paul et \n\nal., 2001; Pinto et al., 2009). \n\nThe final list, including new ecological group assignments and re-assignments, is given \n\nin the following table 07:  \n\n \nTable 07.

In Pirapama, the given classification of \u201cModerately \n\ndisturbed\u201d in 1.0mm/0-10cm for \u201cSlightly disturbed\u201d in both combined/0-10cm and 1.0mm/0-\n\n20cm seemed to be more related to the sieve effect (1.0mm x combined sieves) rather than the \n\ndepth (0-10cm x 0-20cm). On the other hand, in Pina Basin2, both sieves and total depth (0-\n\n20cm) contributed to classify the site\u2019s environmental status, with AMBI values varying from \n\n4.876 (\u201cModerately disturbed\u201d) to 6.000 (\u201cHeavily disturbed\u201d). From an overall perspective, \n\nbetter system conditions were achieved using the combined sieves (1.0+0.5mm) and total layer \n\n(0-20cm) (tab. 09), except for Mamucabas, where the lowest score was the same for 1.0mm \n\nand combined sieves, in 0-20cm. \n\nThe ecological quality of sites (given by mean AMBI values for combined sieves/0-\n\n20cm) was found to be significantly different in urbanized versus conserved areas (two-tailed t-\n\ntest; p=0.016); however, when evaluating the urbanization effects on these environments using \n\ndata from 1.0mm/0-10cm, AMBI did not differ significantly (p<0.05). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n61\n\nII.4. Discussion \n\n The development of biotic indices for assessing the ecological integrity of benthic \n\ncommunities in estuaries and coastal areas has progressed in recent years (Engle et al., 1994; \n\nNilsson and Rosenberg, 1997; Weisberg et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1998; Engle and Summers, \n\n1999; Borja et al., 2000; Paul et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2001; Simboura and Zenetos, 2002; \n\nPaul, 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2004; Dauvin and Ruellet, 2007; Muxika et al., 2007; Hale and \n\nHeltshe, 2008). Although new indices are continuously being created (Diaz et al., 2004), a \n\ngeneral consensus has been emphasized on assessing the suitability of indices that already \n\nexist (Borja et al., 2008) in order to improve their performance in different environments. \n\n In this context, AMBI was chosen among other available indices due to its wide \n\napplicability within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) in relation to the use of \n\nmacrobenthos as a source of information regarding marine environment quality (Borja et al., \n\n2000; Mar\u00edn-Guirao et al., 2005; Muxika et al., 2005; Reiss and Kroncke, 2005; Carvalho et al., \n\n2006; Labrune et al., 2006; Dauvin et al., 2007; Simboura and Reizopoulou, 2007; Zettler et al., \n\n2007; Bigot et al., 2008). Since this index is based on relative proportion of sensitive/tolerant \n\ntaxa, the assignment of dominant species into one of the five ecological groups (EG) constitutes \n\na prerequisite for adequate evaluation of the ecosystems, as described by Bigot et al. (2008). \n\nHowever, appropriate assignments are neither necessarily available (Muniz et al., 2005; Flaten \n\net al., 2007) nor easy to achieve outside European coasts, where AMBI was developed (Borja et \n\nal., 2000; Bigot et al., 2008). In the present study, the overall pattern of ecological quality status \n\nin the sites would be different depending on the assignment of selected species/taxa (see \n\ntab.07). For instance, if these taxa were submitted to AZTI database without modifications of its \n\necological group, the number of sites classified as \u201cHeavily disturbed\u201d would increased from one \n\n(Capibaribe) to five (Capibaribe, Paratibe, Jaboat\u00e3o, Mamucabas and Ipojuca-Merepe), \n\nbesides, Pirapama, Sta Cruz Channel, Paripe and Ariquind\u00e1 should be considered as \n\n\u201cModerately disturbed\u201d instead of \u201cSlightly disturbed\u201d. Other surveys also highlighted the \n\nnecessity of checking the assignment of dominant species to prevent contradictory results from \n\nthe AMBI as the classification of a certain area may diverge when allocating species to an \n\nunsuitable group (Salas et al., 2004; Mar\u00edn-Guirao et al., 2005; Muniz et al., 2005; Labrune et \n\nal., 2006; Albayrak et al., 2006; Bigot et al., 2008). \n\n Another important observation concerning the contributions mentioned above is that \n\nnew ecological group assignments and re-assignments are attributed in relation to previous data \n\nfrom monitoring programs or author experience on ecological characteristics of faunal \n\ncommunities in the studied ecosystems. According to Salas et al. (2004) this implies on an \n\nimportant exercise of subjectivity and leads to impossibility of establishing fixed reference \n\nvalues. The use of a simple method as the Indicator Value (IndVal) coefficient permits that \n\nreviews of assignments of particular taxa to an ecological group might be made in a more \n\nobjective form and less dependent on the historical information, especially in areas where the \n\nknowledge on ecological and environmental characteristics is restricted or unavailable. In this \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n62\n\nstudy, despite the limited number of studied sites, significant Indicator Values enabled the \n\nobjective re-assignments of two important species, Sternaspis sp. and Streblospio sp. \n\n In general, from the results of this study, the AMBI index worked satisfactorily in \n\ndisturbance detection, especially in urbanized estuaries, with recognized pollution condition, as \n\nshowed by monitoring reports (CPRH, 2006). This index was also sufficiently robust to \n\ndiscriminate spatio-temporal effects of organic enrichment in Botafogo and Sirigi, two estuarine \n\nsystems of north coast of Pernambuco subjected to different sources of pollution (probably \n\naquaculture and sugar cane activities, respectively), as outlined by Valen\u00e7a (2007). \n\nNevertheless, some inconsistencies were found in the classification of estuaries placed far from \n\nurban centers and with some level of preservation as Mamucabas, Paripe, Ariquind\u00e1 and \n\nMaraca\u00edpe. Previous studies already indicated that most of Biotic Indices displayed limitations in \n\necosystems with low salinity habitats (Borja and Muxika, 2005a; Muxika et al., 2007) or where \n\nsediment organic matter is naturally high (Borja et al., 2003; Salas et al., 2004; Muxika et al., \n\n2005; Albayrak et al., 2006; Lavesque et al., 2009), as the case of tropical estuaries. The \n\nspecies adapted to these habitats typically occur in high numbers and are listed as tolerant or \n\nopportunistic (Borja et al., 2000; Dauvin, 2007; Elliot and Quintino, 2007; Simboura and \n\nReizopoulou, 2008). In these sites, macrofauna was dominated by Tubificidae oligochaetes \n\n(including Tectidrilus sp.) and Nematoda, both taxa assigned here as ecological group III \n\n(tolerant species). A similar situation was reported by Blanchet et al. (2008), during the \n\nassessment of three French Atlantic coastal areas (Arcachon Bay, Marennes-Ol\u00e9ron Bay and \n\nthe Seine estuary). These authors observed that some sites, considered healthy and well \n\nvegetated (see Blanchet et al., 2004) were classified in moderate or worse status due to the \n\nnumerical abundance of tolerant and opportunistic species. In the mentioned cases, Borja and \n\nMuxika (2005b) recommend the use of AMBI together with other metrics, in order to obtain a \n\nmore comprehensive view of the environmental condition. \n\n Indeed, a combination of AMBI, richness (S) and evenness (J\u2019) seemed to be the best \n\napproach in comparison to the index individually, although the three indices together could \n\ndistinguish the sites in terms of benthic community health (as demonstrated by MDS and \n\nANOSIM analyses) in relation to disturbance levels. These indices are known as measures of \n\nbiotic integrity of macrobenthic community structure and underline species identity and diversity, \n\nwhich are thought to be intrinsically important features of the benthos (D\u00edaz et al., 2003; Borja et \n\nal., 2008). The results from MDS/ANOSIM suggested that benthic communities are separated \n\nas a function of ecological quality, being in agreement with the multivariate correlation between \n\nthe indices and environmental parameters, which pointed out variables associated to pollution \n\ncondition, such as ammonia-N, dissolved oxygen, organic matter or chlorophyll-a. On the other \n\nhand, individual AMBI showed high significant correlation simply with ammonia-N. In general, \n\nthe highest values of AMBI were related to sites with high concentration of ammonia-N, normally \n\nrepresentative of hypoxic/anoxic environments or urbanized areas submitted to organic \n\nenrichment such as sewage, wastewater outfalls and agricultural runoffs (Pinckney, 2006). In \n\ncoastal systems, AMBI has been tested against different anthropogenic sources, which includes \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n63\n\nanoxia and hypoxia, sediment toxicity (metals, PAH), and others (Borja et al., 2003; Muxika et \n\nal., 2005), presenting correlation with total organic carbon (TOC), sediment type (including silt-\n\nclay content), dissolved oxygen concentration (Borja et al., 2000; Muniz et al., 2005; Carvalho et \n\nal., 2006; Borja et al., 2007; Blanchet et al., 2008; Borja et al., 2008; Munari and Mistri, 2008) \n\nand also organic matter and pigments (chlorophyll-a/phaeopigments) content (Dauvin et al., \n\n2007). \n\n Recently, Dauvin et al. (2007) and Pinto et al. (2009) have tested the effect of mesh-\n\nsieve on the values of several indices, and consequently in its classification. Comparing \n\nbiological samples from Bay of Seine and Seine estuary, sieved with both 2.0mm and 1.0mm, \n\nDauvin et al. (2007) showed that AMBI, BQI (Benthic Quality Index; Rosenberg et al., 2004) and \n\nBOPA (Benthic Opportunistic Polychaeta/Amphipoda Index; Dauvin and Ruellet, 2007) \n\nexhibited few changes in the scores, being more evident in the last two indices. In Mondego \n\nestuary, Pinto et al. (2009) compared the performance of BCI (Benthic Condition Index; Engle \n\nand Summers, 1999), B-IBI (Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity; Weisberg et al., 1997) with the \n\nproposed P-BAT (Portuguese-Benthic Assessment Tool, an integration of Shannon-Wiener \n\nindex, Margalef index and AMBI) in relation to two meshes sizes (1.0mm and 1+0.5mm) and \n\nobserved that when both sieves were used, the indices exhibited a decrease in environmental \n\nconditions at the polyhaline sand stations but best conditions in the euhaline estuarine area; \n\nmoreover the combined sieves presented robustness to determine the overall system \n\nclassification. Concerning this study, no pattern was found between AMBI classification and \n\nsalinity, but the use of different sieves (1.0mm x combined meshes) performed a surprising \n\nresult. Once small species associated to organic enrichment usually passe through coarser \n\nsieves (>1.0mm; Schlacher and Wooldridge, 1996; Thompson et al., 2003; Teixeira et al., \n\n2007), it was expected that the use of 0.5mm could provide a worse pollution condition (e.g. \n\nPinto et al., 2009) of the sites. In fact, the combined sieves increased the retention of small \n\nspecimens (mainly Capitellidae polychaetes, Streblospio sp., Tubificidae oligochaetes and \n\nnematodes) assigned here as ecological groups III and V, but the higher proportion of tolerant \n\nspecies in contrast to the opportunistic ones (for both sieves compared to 1.0mm) was \n\nresponsible for the balance of intermediate levels of disturbance, reflecting better system \n\nconditions in most sites. On the other hand, the sampling depth seemed to have less influence \n\non AMBI classification. Despite the fact that differences between 0-10cm and 0-20cm were in \n\nterms of few individuals, the biotic index account for the abundance and taxa composition and \n\nthus was susceptible to these parameters, even though it has not affected the overall \n\ncommunity assessment. Furthermore, the separation of sites considering the location from \n\nurban centers revealed that pollution condition assessment of urbanized and conserved \n\nestuaries given by this index is clearly related to both factors \u2013 mesh-sieve and sampling depth   \n\n In summary, AMBI proved to be efficient in evaluating the quality status of Pernambuco \n\nestuaries, although its applicability requests some adaptations in species\u2019 ecological groups. It \n\nalso demonstrated that the investment in tools as the IndVal coefficient might be essential in \n\nestablishing fixed references for a particular or a group of indicator species, without depending \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n64\n\non prior information on the taxa of the area of study. Moreover, the influence of mesh-sieve and \n\nsampling depth are visible on benthic indices\u2019 performance considering the effect of \n\nurbanization in these estuaries. \n\n \n\nII.5. Conclusion \n\n  In order to determine the biological integrity of macrobenthic communities, every \n\nmethod must incorporate biotic responses through the evaluation of processes from individuals \n\nto ecosystems. Therefore, the mutual use of some metrics allows the integration of biological \n\nfeatures, providing a more accurate diagnosis of the ecosystem\u2019s overall condition. Several \n\nstudies reveal that none of the available indices applied solely should be considered ideal to \n\nmeasure biological effects of pollution, because each index was originally developed for one or \n\nfew stressors. Thus, the complementary use of different indices or methods based on different \n\necological principles is highly recommended for the assessment of environmental quality. It is \n\nsuggested that prior to the application of AMBI index, attention must be taken with the pre-\n\nestablished assignment of an ecological group to each of the sampled species, particularly the \n\ndominant ones. In addition, the present study emphasizes the need for careful methodological \n\nprocedures, including the choice of an appropriate mesh-sieve or sampling depth in \n\ncharacterizing ecological quality of tropical estuarine ecosystems with biotic indices (such as \n\nAMBI) based on macrobenthos relative abundance and composition. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n65\n\nII.6.
