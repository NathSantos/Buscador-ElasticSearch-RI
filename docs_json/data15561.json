Probability and\nStatistics for Business Decisions\n\n(1959)\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis thesis assesses the use of the measured motions of a semisubmersible oil platform\nas a basis for estimating on-site wave spectra. The inference method followed is based on\nthe wave buoy analogy, which aims at solving the linear inverse problem: estimate the\nsea state, given the measured motions and the transfer function of the platform.\n\nDirectional wave inference obtained from the records of vessels motions is a technique\nthat has seen its application grow significantly over the last years. As a matter of fact, its\napplications in ships with forward speed and ship-shaped moored platforms (such as FP-\nSOs) have provided good results. However, little research has been done regarding the use\nof semisubmersible platforms as wave sensors. This is due to the fact that these platforms\nare designed to present no significant responses when excited by waves. Notwithstand-\ning this, the semisubmersible platforms are characterized by measurable small motions.\nMoreover, if compared with ship-shaped motion-based wave sensors, the responses of the\nsemisubmersibles are in better agreement with the response characteristics estimations\nobtained by means of linear hydrodynamic models. In addition, the eminently linear\ncharacteristics of the responses often lasts even for severe wave conditions. This feature\nresults in that the semisubmersible platforms stand as a promising wave sensor even for\nextreme sea states, conditions in which other types of sensors (i.e. buoys, radars) may\nface difficulties. Throughout the text, the main results of this work are presented and\ndiscussed. These results are mainly based on a dedicated experimental campaign, carried\nout with a scaled model of the A?sgar-B platform, which is a semisubmersible platform\nlocated in the A?sgard field offshore Norway. Regarding the sea states tested during the ex-\nperiential campaign, they were estimated by means of a motion-based Bayesian inference\nmethod, which has been developed for more than then years at the EPUSP. In order to\nallow the adoption of the semisubmersible platforms as a motion based wave sensors, this\nthesis provides two significant improvements of the method: first, a method to obtain an\nestimation of the linearized equivalent external viscous damping is provided. This analyt-\nical methodology allows to reduce the uncertainty of the transfer function of the platform\nclose to the resonances of the motions and, as a consequence, it increases the accuracy of\nthe inference approach. The second relevant contribution is the development of an alter-\nnative prior distribution, which is adopted to introduce the prior beliefs regarding the sea\nstate in the Bayesian inference approach. It is shown that although some aspects of this\nnovel approach require further evaluation in future work, the prior distribution developed\nhas potential to improve the accuracy of wave estimates, and, at the same time, it sig-\nnificantly simplifies the calibration procedures followed by other state-of-the-art Bayesian\nwave inference methods.\n\nSumming up, the inference approach proposed in this work provides the bases to use\neach semisubmersible oil platform, which stand as the most common type of oil platforms\noperated offshore Brasil, as a motion based wave sensor, thus contributing to the possible\nbroadening of the Brazilian oceanographic measurement network.\n\nKeywords: Semisubmersible Platform.

No entanto, o poss??vel emprego de plataformas semissubmers??veis para o mesmo\nfim foi muito pouco explorado ate? o momento. Evidentemente, isso decorre da suposic?a?o\nde que, uma vez que essas estruturas sa?o projetadas com o intuito primeiro de atenuar\nos movimentos decorrentes das ac?o?es de ondas, naturalmente elas na?o seriam bons sen-\nsores para esta finalidade. Os resultados apresentados nesta tese, todavia, contrariam tal\nsuposic?a?o. De fato, as semissubmers??veis respondem de forma fraca a?s ondas, pore?m esta\nresposta e? mensura?vel. Na?o apenas isso, mas, em comparac?a?o com os cascos de navios,\nesta resposta adere melhor a?s previso?es dos modelos hidrodina?micos lineares a partir dos\nquais as caracter??sticas da plataforma sa?o estimadas. Ademais, o cara?ter eminentemente\nlinear da resposta muitas vezes perdura inclusive para condic?o?es de ondas severas. Isto,\npor sua vez, torna as semissubmers??veis promissoras inclusive para a estimac?a?o de mares\nextremos, situac?a?o nas quais os outros tipos de sensores (boias, radares) enfrentam dificul-\ndades. Nesta tese, a demonstrac?a?o destes fatos e? sustentada por um extenso conjunto de\ntestes experimentais realizados em tanque de ondas com um modelo em escala reduzida\nde uma plataforma que hoje opera no Mar do Norte. Para tanto, foi empregado um\nme?todo de infere?ncia Bayesiana para estimac?a?o de ondas em navios que vem sendo desen-\nvolvido na EPUSP ha? mais de dez anos. Para o estudo das semissubmers??veis o trabalho\npropo?e duas melhorias importantes no me?todo: A primeira consiste em um procedimento\nanal??tico para prever o amortecimento hidrodina?mico de origem viscosa dos movimentos\nobservados do casco. Este procedimento permite reduzir as incertezas quanto a? func?a?o\nde resposta em condic?o?es de ressona?ncia dos movimentos com as ondas e, dessa forma,\naumentar a confiabilidade do me?todo. A segunda contribuic?a?o relevante e? a proposic?a?o\nde uma alternativa para a chamada distribuic?a?o a priori originalmente empregada pelo\nme?todo Bayesiano. Demonstra-se que, embora alguns aspectos desta nova metodologia\nainda necessitem de uma avaliac?a?o adicional em trabalhos futuros, a nova distribuic?a?o tem\ngrande potencial para melhorar a precisa?o das estimativas de ondas, ale?m de simplificar\nde maneira significativa os procedimentos atuais de calibrac?a?o do sistema de infere?ncia.\n\nEm suma, o me?todo de infere?ncia aqui proposto abre caminho para tornar cada\nunidade flutuante de o?leo e ga?s do tipo semissubmers??vel, um dos sistemas de produc?a?o\nmais frequentes nas costas brasileiras, um eventual ponto de monitoramento de ondas,\ncontribuindo enta?o para a poss??vel ampliac?a?o de nossas bases de medic?a?o oceanogra?ficas.\n\nPalavras-Chave: Plataforma Semissubmers??vel.

nearshore operations, engineering design and validation of forecasts of extreme\n\nwave events. In general, field measurements of the sea conditions are collected by research\n\ninstitutions and governmental organizations. Notwithstanding this, a significant amount\n\nof these meteorological and physical oceanographic data (also known as metocean data)\n\nis collected by private industry, in particular by Oil and Gas (O&amp;G) companies.\n\nAs a matter of fact, observed metocean data and analyses provide the O&amp;G industry\n\nwith essential information and knowledge for the design and engineering of offshore in-\n\nstallations, such as platforms and pipelines, and decision support systems. For the sake of\n\nillustration of the main benefits related to the use of ocean data, some examples extracted\n\nfrom (SHAW et al., 1999) are provided:\n\n\u2022 A 5% reduction in design wave height translates into a reduction in steel costs that\n\nmay range between 5% and 10%;\n\n\u2022 Decision support systems (which are crucial for a proper operational management)\n\nadopted during the installation and operation of offshore platforms are based on\n\nweather forecasts and real-time metocean data;\n\n\u2022 The selection of the most convenient platform type for field exploration/production\n\nis usually based on historical sea data measurements.\n\nThe assessments and discussions regarding the research carried out and presented in\n\nthis work are expected to represent a small contribution towards the development of the\n\n\n\n2\n\na more sophisticated and efficient network of wave monitoring systems, through the use\n\nof a semisubmersible platform as a motion based sea wave sensor.\n\n1.1.1 Wave estimation in the sea: The state-of-the-art\n\nFor the purpose of this thesis, it is important to bear in mind the general principles\n\nand theory of wave measuring systems. For readers not familiar with such devices, a\n\ngeneral overview of the main technologies is provided, including the wave buoys and wave\n\nradars, but this overview is by no means exhaustive. (BARSTOW et al., 2005) stands as a\n\nreference for the readers interested in a comprehensive description of the wave measuring\n\ntechnologies assessed below.\n\nWave conditions in the ocean can be characterized according to the data collected\n\nthrough wave measurement devices. Nevertheless, one must remember that the sea sur-\n\nface elevation cannot be described by means of an explicit mathematical model and,\n\nas a consequence, it is assumed to be a time-space random process (DENIS; PIERSON,\n\n1953). Hence, to properly describe the sea state, the directional energy wave density spec-\n\ntrum is commonly adopted. The directional energy wave density spectrum, also know as\n\ndirectional wave spectrum, provides information regarding the distribution of the wave\n\nenergy in both frequency and direction domain and it is estimated using the data collected\n\nthrough sea wave monitoring systems. Figure 1.1 shows a simple illustration of the main\n\nfeatures that a directional wave spectrum presents.\n\nFigure 1.1: Directional wave spectrum. From (LLOYD, 1989).\n\n\n\n3\n\nIn general, on-site measurements of ocean data are obtained through moored buoys,\n\nwhich enclose a wide range of models. In (BARSTOW et al., 2005) the authors followed a\n\ncategorization based on the variables recorded by these devices (e.g. acceleration, vertical\n\ndisplacement, etc.) resulting in the following types of wave buoys: (i) heave-roll-pitch\n\nbuoys, (ii) displacement buoys and (iii) GPS buoys. The earliest reference to using a\n\nwave buoy for directional wave measurements appeared in (BARBER; URSELL, 1948),\n\nbut it was not until some years later that Longuet-Higgins, Cartwright and Smith (1963)\n\nprovided a systematical discussion and characterization of the main fundamentals of these\n\nsystems, which rely on the use of the measured motions of the buoy as a basis to estimate\n\nthe wave spectrum and the associated sea state parameters. The relevance of the wave\n\nbuoys as a wave measurement systems is attested by several works, such as the WADIC\n\nproject (ALLENDER et al., 1989), that presented the results of a one-year field trial\n\nin the North Sea and included a comprehensive analysis of the data obtained with five\n\ndifferent wave buoys measurement systems.\n\nDuring the past decades these devices have been complemented by new technologies.\n\nAn example of these technologies is the wave radar measuring system, whose general\n\nprinciple is well known. These wave radars are generally classified based on their working\n\nfrequency band. Thus, radars with HF and VHF bands are usually under 300 MHz.\n\nRegarding the navigation radars, the preferred band corresponds to the X-band (8 to 12\n\nGHz.), which requires very small antennas due to the fact that the size of antennas is\n\nrelated to the length of the signal (higher frequencies require smaller antennas). Several\n\nworks have been developed using radar data to characterize the wave conditions, such\n\nas (MAGNUSSON, 2008), where the author used wave radar data to forecast extreme\n\nwave condition in central North Sea. (FUCILE et al., 2016) is another interesting work\n\nregarding the wave inference using radar data, in this case the authors provided two\n\nanalysis techniques based on measurements collected using radar imaging. An illustration\n\nof wave buoy and wave radar measurement systems is provided in Fig. 1.2.\n\nAt the same time, there are several difficulties associated with the measuring of the\n\nwave conditions through these wave monitoring systems. Indeed, a drawback arises in\n\nextreme weather conditions when these systems may render inaccurate measurements.\n\nFor instance, wave buoys may be dragged through or swerve around the 3D peaks of\n\nwaves (ALLENDER et al., 1989). Furthermore, the accuracy of the buoy displace-\n\n\n\n4\n\nFigure 1.2: Wave monitoring systems: Wave buoy (left) and wave radar (right). From\n(TECHNOLOGIES, 2018) and (OLJEMUSEUM, 2015), respectively.\n\nments decreases when long swell wave energy (> 20s) is present (ESSEN; EWANS; MC-\n\nCONOCHIE, 2018). In addition, eventual presence of a spike in the raw accelerometer\n\ndata may produce erratic maximum wave height measurements (MACKAY, 2009). Rough\n\nsea states and adverse weather conditions are also among the possible sources of errors\n\nin wave measurements from wave radar systems, since errors can be attributed to the\n\nshadowing effects produced by rain, large waves or sea spray, as well as the inherent bias\n\nof the system that can happen to increase under extreme sea conditions (MAGNUSSON,\n\n2008).\n\nComparisons between estimations obtained with wave buoys and wave radars have\n\nshown some important discrepancies,see for example (DURRANT; GREENSLADE; SIM-\n\nMONDS, 2009; CHEN et al., 2013) and (WIJAYA, 2009), highlighting the inherent biasses\n\nand differences in the performance of these sensors in different sea conditions. Therefore,\n\naiming at estimate the directional wave spectrum, several assumptions must be made,\n\nwhich should be different from one instrument to another. This aspect of the wave moni-\n\ntoring systems is well illustrated in (BARSTOW et al., 2005), where the authors pointed\n\nout the importance of understanding the main strengths and weaknesses of each measure-\n\nment system in order to judge which parameters of the wave spectrum can be accurately\n\nestimated.\n\nReturning to the wave buoys, nowadays they are in widespread use as they are the\n\nmost common monitoring technology. This fact is well depicted by the number of these\n\ndevices deployed within the major O&amp;G fields. For instance, Fig. 1.3 shows the moored\n\n\n\n5\n\nwave buoys currently operating in the Gulf of Mexico. This figure includes more than 150\n\nof these devices which are operated by governmental and private institutions. These wave\n\nbuoys are concentrated in an area equivalent to 1 million square kilometers (the upper\n\nhalf part of the Gulf of Mexico) with a water depth ranging from 300m to 2150m, where\n\nthe main O&amp;G exploration and production operations are carried out.\n\nFigure 1.3: Wave buoys stations in the Gulf of Mexico. Data from (NOAA, 2018).\n\nThere are several reasons that have had a significant impact on the adoption of these\n\ndevices. Table 1.1, extracted from (FILIPPELLI et al., 2015), shows the most relevant\n\nfactors referring to the cost range, estimate deployment time and net energy uncertainty\n\nfor different wave measuring systems. The values provided in this table include the esti-\n\nmated cost of the systems as well as the installation and operation for a time span of 3\n\nyears. Nonetheless, these systems usually require a calibration campaign, that generates\n\nan extra-cost that varies between 5% and 10% of the total cost of the system (FILIP-\n\nPELLI et al., 2015). From these data, one may realize that the measurement systems\n\nmost commonly adopted (wave buoys) present the lower prices and deployment times\n\ncompared to other systems, although in some cases these advantages may be obtained at\n\nthe cost of increasing the energy uncertainty.\n\nEven though the advantages of using the wave monitoring systems seem clear (tech-\n\nnical decisions are made, based on the collected metocean data, on whether or not spend\n\nmany millions of dollars while the cost involved in collecting these data are several orders\n\n\n\n6\n\nTable 1.1: Summary of the deployment time, cost and energy uncertainty for different\nmonitoring systems. In this table M stands for million and k for thousand. Data from\n(FILIPPELLI et al., 2015).\n\nMonitoring System Deployment time Cost Range Energy Uncertainty\nHub-Height Tower/Platform 24 months $ 4.5 ? 13 M 5.6% to 7.3%\n\nBuoy-Based Radar 12 months $ 0.8 ? 2.8 M 6.4% to 8.1%\nPlatform-Based Radar 6 months $ 300 ? 550 k 5.6% to 7.3%\n\nWeather Buoy 4 months $ 150 ? 300 k 2% to 11.8%\n\nof magnitude lower), some regions in the world containing major oil fields are not yet\n\ncharacterized by a proper network of wave monitoring sensors. As an example, Fig. 1.4\n\nshows the moored buoys installed offshore the Brazilian Southern region. This region\n\nincludes the Santos, Campos and Esp??rito Santo basins, which represent the major part\n\nof the Brazilian O&amp;G reserves and account for more than 60 bilion barrels of oil.\n\nFigure 1.4: Wave buoys stations in the Santos, Campos and Esp??ritu Santo basins, located\nin the Southern region of the Brazilian coast. Data from (GOOS-BRASIL, 2018) and\n(NOAA, 2018).\n\nThe offshore area included in Fig. 1.4 is equivalent to 1,2 millions of square kilometers,\n\nwhere the maximum water depth is about 3000m. This figure provides the moored buoys\n\noperated by governmental and private organizations. Differently from the Gulf of Mexico,\n\nin this area only seven buoys are currently installed and four of them are under mainte-\n\n\n\n7\n\nnance operations (orange markers) at the current date (25/08/2018). Thus, only 3 buoys\n\nare monitoring an area that is equivalent in extension and relevance to the one assessed\n\npreviously in the Gulf of Mexico (where more than 150 of these devices are operating).\n\nThe lack of a proper monitoring network of wave buoys can be explained by several rea-\n\nsons, such as the technical challenges that arise during the installation/manteinance of\n\nthese devices in deep and ultra-deep water conditions1 and the fact that O&amp;G industries\n\nbegan the development of their deep water activities in part of these fields during the late\n\n90s and early 2000s.\n\nAn alternative to overcome the lack of wave measurement systems would be the use of\n\nthe O&amp;G floating offshore platforms operating in the Brazilian coast as wave sensors. The\n\nmain idea here is to complement the wave measurements obtained through the moored\n\nbuoys with the sea state estimations computed based on the measured motions of the\n\noffshore platforms. Thus, for example, if all the floating platforms currently operated by\n\nPetrobras in the region assessed previously in Fig. 1.4 were adopted as wave sensors, the\n\nresulting network of monitoring systems would be composed by more than 40 sensors.\n\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 1.4, were the network of waves buoys shown in Fig. 1.4 is com-\n\nplemented by the location of the floating O&amp;G offshore platforms operated by Petrobras.\n\nThe adoption of moored floating offshore platforms as on-site wave sensors to improve\n\nthe wave measurement network in the Brazilian coast was an idea initially proposed\n\nin 1999, by the Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department along with the\n\nMechatronics Engineering Department of the Polytechnic School of University of Sa?o\n\nPaulo (EPUSP). The relevance and the main characteristics of this approach, also known\n\nas vessel motion-based wave inference (or for short, VMB wave inference) are properly\n\naddressed in the following section.\n\n1.1.2 Relevance of the VMB wave inference method for the in-\ndustry\n\nIn the 1980s the firsts works assessing the VMB wave inference appeared, e.g. (WEB-\n\nSTER; DILLINGHAM, 1981), mainly using short records of data for the analysis. Other\n\nworks regarding this research topic were developed during the late 90s and early 2000s,\n\n1Deep water is considered to be anything more than 1500 meters and the top end of ultra deep water\ncomes at around 2133 meters.\n\n\n\n8\n\nFigure 1.5: Wave buoys and O&amp;G floating offshore paltforms stations in the Santos,\nCampos and Esp??tu Santo basins. Data from (GOOS-BRASIL, 2018), (NOAA, 2018)\nand (PETROBRAS, 2018).\n\nwhen the computing power available made the adoption of this method practical. These\n\nimprovements lead to the first reliable application of the VMB wave inference, carried out\n\nusing a container ship with forward speed. A detailed and comprehensive description of\n\nthe application of this technique for wave inference in the shipping industry is provided\n\nin (NIELSEN, 2005).\n\nSimultaneously, as it has been pointed out in the previous section, at EPUSP an ex-\n\ntensive research program was being done to assess the use of the floating offshore platform\n\nfor on-site VMB wave inference. Due to the central importance of this long-term research\n\ntopic, the entire research program was supported by Petrobras in the years followed. In\n\norder to carry out this research, Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) and\n\nsemisubmersible type platforms were evaluated as bases for VMB wave inference before\n\nthe starting of the research campaign (Fig. 1.6 provides an illustration of both types of\n\noffshore structures). Finally, the former was selected over the later as a consequence of\n\nthe following reasons:\n\n\u2022 The hydrodynamical properties of the semisubmersible platforms as well as their\n\nmassive dimensions result in motions with small or non-significant amplitudes.\n\n\n\n9\n\nHence, it was assumed that this type of platforms will not have the appropriate\n\nbehavior for being used as wave sensor. Nevertheless, this assumption (which was\n\naccepted at the moment) was in fact inaccurate as it is shown in this thesis;\n\n\u2022 Preceding works on VMB wave inference had been carried out in ship-shaped vessels,\n\nobtaining promising results for a several range of sea conditions;\n\n\u2022 At that time, FPSO offshore platforms were already a common type of offshore\n\nplatform operated by Petrobras in the Brazilian offshore waters, specially in the\n\nCampos basin.\n\nAs a result of this long term research, several works have been published, e.g. (TANNURI\n\net al., 2003; SIMOS et al., 2010, 2012) and (BISPO et al., 2012), where the authors\n\ncarried out an assessment of the use of a moored FPSO as a VMB wave sensor. The\n\nresults provided in these works (obtained during model-scale and full-scale experimental\n\ncampaigns) show that the FPSO type platforms can be used as reliable wave sensors.\n\nFigure 1.6: FPSO Cidade de Ilhabela (left) and semisubmersible P-51 (right). From\n(PETROBRAS, 2018).\n\nA common feature of all these VMB wave inference works is the adoption of the\n\nBayesian inference method to solve the inverse problem, which is by nature ill-conditioned.\n\nThe adoption of this statistical approach allows to take into account measurements and\n\nmodel uncertainties in the inverse problem, avoiding misleading estimations of the un-\n\nknown (BERNARDO; SMITH, 2006). Hence, the outcome of the problem (the posterior\n\ndistribution of the quantity of interest, in this case the wave spectrum) combines the\n\ninformation provided by the measured motions of the vessel with relevant available prior\n\ninformation about the sea conditions. In general, the prior information for VMB wave\n\n\n\n10\n\ninference is limited to: (i) assume that the difference between the spectra of the measured\n\nmotions and the estimated ones is Gaussian distributed and that (ii) the sea spectrum\n\ninferred must be characterized by a certain level of smoothness (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000).\n\nIt is important to highlight that the pertinence of the prior information and its relevance\n\non the output of the problem is tuned through a set of prior parameters also known as\n\nhyperparameters.\n\nAs for the other wave measurement systems, the VMB wave inference is also char-\n\nacterized by some limitations. The major shortcoming of the method is that the vessel\n\nacts as a kind of low-pass filter, filtering the wave components that do not excite the\n\nvessels responses (mainly high frequency ones). Therefore, the larger the vessel, or the\n\nlower its response in waves, the more restricted will be the estimation range. As an il-\n\nlustration of this limitation, when the estimation is based on a very large vessel, such as\n\na FPSO platform with a VLCC hull, previous studies (BISPO et al., 2016) have shown\n\nthat wave conditions may be well captured by the method only for peak periods above 8\n\nseconds. For this reason, the VMB wave inference approach is not intended for provid-\n\ning broad oceanographic records, but rather to be used as a means for identifying wave\n\nconditions that impose considerable motions on the vessel on which the system is based\n\non. A possible overcome to this drawback is assessed in (SOUZA et al., 2018), where\n\nthe authors combined the Bayesian VMB wave inference and the use of on-board wave\n\nprobes; following the technique discussed in (PINKSTER et al., 1978) to measure the\n\nhigh-order components of the wave spectrum by means of wave gauges installed around\n\nthe hull. This combination of different approaches resulted in a novel methodology that\n\naims at extending the range of wave frequencies that can be estimated through VMB\n\nwave inference, including the high-frequency ones.\n\nIn the year 2014, the VMB wave inference research program carried out at University\n\nof Sa?o Paulo (USP) consolidated an important milestone with the starting of an extensive\n\nresearch project, supported by EQUINOR (ex-STATOIL) in partnership with Petrobras\n\nand the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP). One of the topics envisioned in\n\nthis partnership was the assessment of the use of a large semisubmersible platform as a\n\nVMB sea wave sensor. This idea proposed by the EQUINOR\u2019s department of physical\n\noceanography had as a main objective the inference of extreme sea conditions, that would\n\ninduce significant motions on a semisubmersible platform increasing its reliability as VMB\n\n\n\n11\n\ninference sensor. This research project also enclosed the assessment of the use of wave-\n\nprobes to increase the reliability of the VMB wave inference method in the high frequency-\n\ndomain and a two years real scale monitoring campaign in the Peregrino field, located\n\nin the southwest part of the Campos Basin, using the measured motions onboard of the\n\nPeregrino FPSO, which is operated by EQUINOR and its partner Sinochem. Another\n\nimprovement related to the project was the development of a fully working graphical user\n\ninterface (GUI), that allows an effective operation and control of the VMB wave inference\n\nalgorithm. Figure 1.7 provides an example of the developed GUI.\n\nFigure 1.7: GUI of the VMB wave estimation software. From (BISPO et al., 2016).\n\nRegarding the idea proposed by EQUINOR of using a semisubmersible platform as\n\na VMB wave inference sensor, it was assessed by means of a dedicated model-scale ex-\n\nperimental campaign carried out in the wave basin of the USP\u2019s numerical offshore tank\n\n(TPN-USP) using a scaled model of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform, currently\n\noperating offshore Norway. The results of the tests carried out at the TPN-USP are\n\npresented in this thesis, showing the reliability of this type of platforms for VMB wave\n\n\n\n12\n\ninference not only for severe sea conditions but also for mild sea states.\n\nFor the reader interested in the results obtained through this project, some publica-\n\ntions already available are (BISPO et al., 2016; MAS-SOLER et al., 2017; SOUZA et al.,\n\n2018) and (MAS-SOLER; SIMOS; TANNURI, 2018).\n\nSumming up, it can be stated that the growing interest in the VMB wave inference\n\napproach comes from the accuracy of the estimations obtained, the technical advantages of\n\nthe method as well as the simplicity of the hardware required on-board (mainly composed\n\nby an ordinary set of accelerometers connected to a consumer-level PC, hardware that\n\nthe major part of the O&amp;G offshore platforms already have installed on-board). These\n\npractical aspects guarantee a lower initial investment, compared to other technologies,\n\nsuch as radar systems or wave buoys, and uncomplicated maintenance of the system.\n\nFrom the point of view of the offshore O&amp;G industry, the use of the VMB wave inference\n\nmethod has several advantages:\n\n\u2022 Ships and offshore platforms can work together to provide worldwide information\n\nabout the sea conditions, even from remote areas, at anytime. This feature could\n\nimprove the exploration activities in more remote offshore areas as well as in deep\n\nor ultra-deep water oil fields, where other measuring devices may presents some\n\nlimitations regarding their installation and operation. The latter application may\n\nhave significant importance for the exploration and production activities carried out\n\noffshore the Brazilian coast, where the major oil and gas reservoirs are located in\n\ndeep or ultra-deep water conditions;\n\n\u2022 VMB wave inference may provide real-time information about the sea condition,\n\nthat is crucial for a proper operational management of an offshore platform. In this\n\ncase, the use of the VMB wave inference may result in significant improvements\n\nin many offshore activities, such as drilling operations, shuttle tanker operations,\n\ninstallation of the topsides facilities relative to floating or fixed platforms and in the\n\nassessment of the downtime for production facilities.\n\nAs a result, the VMB wave inference has become the object of investigation both in\n\nshipping and the O&amp;G sectors, see for example (MAS-SOLER; SIMOS; TANNURI, 2018;\n\nNIELSEN; BRODTKORB; S\u00d8RENSEN, 2018) and (NIELSEN, 2018), as a reference\n\n\n\n13\n\nof the last developments attained in this research topic. As a matter of fact, due to the\n\nremarkable results obtained using the inference algorithm developed at EPUSP, Petrobras\n\nhas started a new project aiming to test and implement the VMB wave inference software\n\nduring its offshore operations.\n\nFinally, it is important to highlight that the main motivations for this thesis not\n\nonly come from the general practical advantages of the VMB wave inference but also\n\nfrom the fact that although a semisubmersible is designed for responding only weakly to\n\nthe incoming waves, it will still present significant linear motions in more severe wave\n\nconditions and, in these situations, it may perhaps provide an interesting complement\n\nto the readings of other devices. This would guarantee the reliability and accuracy of\n\nthe method even in harsh environmental conditions, that are of important relevance for\n\noffshore projects. Nevertheless, one of the challenges arising from the use of the VMB\n\nwave inference approach to estimate extreme sea conditions is the possible lack of linearity\n\nbetween the induced motions of the platform and the wave exciting forces. For this reason,\n\nnon-linear effects and their implications should be carefully analyzed in order to improve\n\nthe robustness of the estimations and avoid misleading inferred sea statistics.\n\n1.2 Objectives\n\nThe use of a large semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor is investigated in\n\nthe present thesis by means of a dedicated model-scale experimental campaign. In order to\n\nfully understand the major characteristics of the dynamics of a semisubmersible platform\n\nin various sea conditions, ranging from mild to extremely rough sea states, the model of the\n\nsystem has been set as simple as possible, only including wave exciting forces. Accordingly,\n\nrisers or mooring lines have not been modelled during the experimental campaign. The\n\nobjectives herein are set aiming at addressing the main motivation referred to in the\n\nprevious section.\n\n1. Asses if the Bayesian VMB wave inference method can be used in a robust way to\n\naccurately infere severe wave conditions based on the measured motions of a large\n\nsemisubmersible platform.\n\nFor this purpose the Bayesian inference approach proposed by Tannuri et al. (2003)\n\n\n\n14\n\nhas been adopted. Answers to the following questions are sought:\n\n(a) Are the assumptions, regarding the linear excitation-responses (NIELSEN,\n\n2005) along with the properties of the wave spectrum (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000),\n\nvalid for the use of a semisubmersible platform as a wave sensor?\n\n(b) Is the procedure adopted by Tannuri et al. (2003) to determine the prior dis-\n\ntribution sufficiently robust to properly control the uncertainties of the model\n\ninduced mainly by non-linear effects?\n\n(c) What are the most relevant sea conditions to be tested in the wave basin in\n\norder to provide a reliable evaluation of the use of the semisubmersible platform\n\nas a VMB wave sensor?\n\n(d) Are the sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign accurately\n\nestimated through the method?\n\n2. Discuss the selection of the prior distribution and propose an alternative approach\n\naiming at increasing the accuracy of the estimations.\n\nRegarding this objective, a brief discussion of the different prior distributions has\n\nbeen conducted, including the approaches adopted in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000; NIELSEN,\n\n2008) and (TANNURI et al., 2003). Also, a new prior distribution alternative to\n\nthe previous ones is proposed. Through this, answers to the following questions will\n\nbe sought:\n\n(a) What are the main characteristics of the various prior distributions in use\n\nnowadays for wave inference?\n\n(b) Which is the most appropriate prior distribution, among the ones compared,\n\nfor the current problem?\n\n(c) How can an alternative prior distribution provide practical improvements for\n\nthe method?\n\n3. Introduce an appropriate procedure to model the response amplitude operators and\n\ndeal with the typical non-linearities of the resonant motions.\n\nPreviously, it has been highlighted that one of the challenges arising from using a\n\nsemisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor to estimate severe sea conditions is\n\n\n\n15\n\nthat non-linear responses should be properly accounted for. In this regard, answers\n\nto the following questions will be sought:\n\n(a) Which motions are expected to be more sensitive to non-linear effects and how\n\ndo they impact the wave estimations?\n\n(b) What are the sources of such non-linearities?\n\n(c) Can the estimations of the VMB wave inference be improved by means of a\n\nsimple damping model that account for these non-linearities?\n\n4. Evaluate the limits, in terms of the accuracy of the estimations of the motion-based\n\nwave inference method using the measured motions of a model-scale semisubmersible\n\nplatform.\n\nDuring the experimental campaign only long crested waves have been simulated in\n\nthe wave basin. Since these tests do not include current and wind effects, the model\n\nof the platform has been kept as simple as possible, without including submerged\n\nlines (such as risers and mooring lines) nor the topside. However, in extreme sea\n\nconditions, other phenomena, such as wind and current effects, may excite the plat-\n\nform motions. Consequently, the results obtained during the experimental campaign\n\nmay be not enough representative for extreme weather conditions. Accordingly, the\n\nanswers to the following questions will be sought:\n\n(a) What are the potential effects of other environmental conditions, such as cur-\n\nrent or wind, on the responses of the semisubmersible platform?\n\n(b) Do the submerged lines have a substantial influence on the motions of the\n\nsemisubmersible platform within the frequency range of interest?\n\n(c) Are there other limitations of the Bayesian approach when dealing with the\n\nmotions of a semisubmersible in a full-scale application, which have not been\n\nconsidered yet?\n\n1.3 Methodology\n\nThe fulfillment of the objectives enumerated in the previous section results in elab-\n\norated and complex procedures. Thus, it is interesting to provide a general idea of the\n\n\n\n16\n\napproach adopted to meet each one of these topics.\n\n1.3.1 The non-parametric approach: The Bayesian VMB wave\ninference\n\nSince the main interest is the adoption of the Bayesian VMB wave inference approach,\n\nit is important to validate the relevance of the hypothesis endorsed in this approach when\n\na semisubmersible platform is adopted as a wave sensor. With this aim, a systemati-\n\ncal review of the literature has been carried out. This assessment mainly consists in a\n\ncomprehensive comparison between the hypothesis in the Bayesian VMB wave inference\n\napproach and the theoretical/experimental analysis described in relevant works, such as\n\n(GODA, 2000) and (HAVER; MOAN, 1983).\n\nConcerning the sea conditions tested in the wave basin of the TPN-USP, they range\n\nfrom mild to extreme sea states. Thus, the resulting test matrix allows the evaluation\n\nof the feasibility of a semisubmersible platform as a wave sensor in a wide range of sea\n\nconditions. Moreover, the features of the water surface elevation time series, which have\n\nbeen measured by means of wave probes, are evaluated to determine if they are consistent\n\nwith the assumptions previously reviewed. It is important to highlight the fact that the\n\nadoption of capacitive waves probes to register the water surfaces elevation guarantees\n\naccurate registers without disturbing the mechanically generated waves.\n\nThis approach ensures that the sea conditions generated during the experimental\n\ncampaign as well as the model of the semisubmersible paltform are in agreement with the\n\nhypotheses adopted to estimate the sea conditions by means of the bayesian VMB wave\n\ninference technique.\n\n1.3.2 The role of the prior distribution in the Bayesian VMB\nwave inference\n\nPrevious works estimating the sea conditions by means of the Bayesian VMB wave\n\ninference approach (e.g. (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000; NIELSEN, 2005) or (TANNURI et al.,\n\n2003)) have in common the model that describes the dynamic responses of the vessel,\n\nwhich linearly relates the excitation (in this case the sea state, that is the unknown of\n\nthe problem) with the measured motions. However, differences arise between the prior\n\n\n\n17\n\ndistributions presented in the literature. More precisely, these differences appear between\n\nthe number of the prior parameters adopted to estimate the sea state and the approach\n\nfollowed to estimate their values. In other words, the main difference between these works\n\nhas its origin in the relevance given to the prior knowledge and the hypothesis adopted\n\nregarding the wave spectrum.\n\nA dedicated analysis of these differences have been provided in this thesis. Further-\n\nmore, the main conclusions obtained from this assessment are evaluated to determine\n\nwhich prior distribution would be the most appropriate to estimate the sea conditions\n\nusing the motions of the semisubmersible platform. It is important to remember that this\n\napproach envisages the identification of the main shortcomings that characterize each\n\nprior distribution, which posteriorly have been taken into account in order to develop a\n\nnew prior distribution to overcome them.\n\n1.3.3 Modelling non-linearities of the resonant motions\n\nIt has been pointed out that the techniques based on the wave buoy analogy have in\n\ncommon the approach followed to model the dynamics of the wave sensor, that relates\n\nthe excitations with the induced responses through a transfer function. Even though the\n\napproach adopted in the literature already includes some uncertainties of the model by\n\nmeans of adding a certain amount of noise, it is expected that non-linear effects may\n\nresult in misleading estimations.\n\nMore precisely, the effects of these non-linearities start to become relevant close the\n\nresonance of the motions, that corresponds to the frequency range where the damping\n\nterms govern the dynamics of the platform. Consequently, the VMB wave inference\n\napproach may render inaccurate estimations of the sea conditions for low frequency sea\n\nwaves, where the resonances of the motions appear.\n\nIn order to determine the linear model and also take account of these non-linearities\n\nthe following approach is followed.\n\n\u2022 The transfer functions adopted to model the dynamics of the platform have been\n\nobtained in the frequency-domain using a diffraction analysis, which characterizes\n\nthe primary hydrodynamic parameters of the platform. The resulting transfer func-\n\n\n\n18\n\ntions can be improved adopting a representative constant damping value for each\n\nmotion, thus leading to bounded responses of the platform close its resonances. The\n\ndamping values used in this work have been estimated empirically, using the data\n\nobtained during the calibration tests carried out at the wave basin in TPN-USP.\n\n\u2022 A sensitive analysis of the possible damping effects arising from the submerged\n\nlines (moorings &amp; risers) has been carried out through numerical simulations in\n\nANSYS-AQWA. These simulations compare the responses of the model without\n\nthe submerged lines (as it is tested in the wave basin) with the responses of a\n\nquasi complete model, that includes the submerged lines (mooring and risers). It\n\nis important to remember that due to the nature of the problem being solved, non-\n\nlinear effects only have been evaluated for the motions that present their resonance\n\nin the wave frequency range of interest.\n\n\u2022 A theoretical approach is followed to develop a simple model that estimates the\n\ndamping effects on the heave motion. This model is based on the hydrodynamic\n\ndrag forces acting on the pontoons and provides the damping of the motion in accor-\n\ndance with the measured amplitudes. Thus, the response amplitude functions can be\n\nupgraded constantly using the amplitude of the motions measured. Also, the relia-\n\nbility of the approach proposed to estimate the external damping has been analyzed\n\nby means of a comparison between the results obtained through this methodology\n\nand the experimental measurements.\n\n1.3.4 Assessing the accuracy of the VMB wave inference method-\nology based on a semisubmersible platform\n\nIn order to estimate the sea conditions generated in the wave basin in the TPN-USP\n\nthe measured motions of a model-scale semisubmersible platform have been adopted.\n\nThese motions are recorded through an optical tracking system, which guarantees accurate\n\nrecordings of the model motions. Since the responses of all the six degrees of freedom (dofs)\n\nhave been recorded, the linearity of the responses is assessed by means of the coherence\n\nfunctions to determine the most convenient base of motions for the wave inference.\n\nAt the same time, the measurements obtained during the experimental campaign\n\nthrough the wave probes have been used as a paradigm to validate the numerical char-\n\n\n\n19\n\nacterization of the semisubmersible platform model as well as the estimations obtained\n\nthrough the VMB wave inference.\n\n1.4 Text structure\n\nThe contents of the thesis have been organized into six chapters, including the present\n\none. Chapter 2 is devoted to a review of the literature concerning the existing motion-\n\nbased wave inference methodologies. Chapter 3 provides a brief analysis of the stochastic\n\ndescription of the sea states and the hypotheses assumed to compute the motion re-\n\nsponses of the platform. The contents of this chapter are also linked to appendices A, B\n\nand C, which include a detailed analysis regarding various statistical properties of the sea\n\nconditions generated in the wave basin and their extrapolation to real-scale. Moreover,\n\nappendix D brings an assessment of the heave responses of a semisubmersible platform.\n\nChapter 4 contains a detailed description of the Bayesian inference approach and the\n\nmain hypothesis adopted; also, the main inference methods adopted in this work are ex-\n\nplained systematically, including the development of an alternative prior distribution for\n\nwave inference. The contents of this chapter are associated with appendix E, that aims\n\nat providing a broader understanding of the features of the prior distribution. Chapter 5\n\nincludes the description of the model-scale experimental campaign carried out in the wave\n\nbasin of the TPN-USP, using a scaled model of a large semisubmersible platform (content\n\nthat is related to appendix F). This chapter also presents the results of the estimations\n\nobtained using the motion-based Bayesian inference method, that were checked against\n\nthe measurements obtained by means of an array of wave-probes. Finally, chapter 6 is\n\na summary of the main conclusions reached through this work, that are complemented\n\nwith recommendations for future work.\n\n\n\n20\n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nIn general, there are several approaches that may be considered for performing wave\n\ninference based on the recorded motions of a vessel (see Nielsen (2017) for a recent review).\n\nAs a first option, the wave spectrum can be estimated on a parametric approach. This\n\nmethod is used to estimate the sea conditions from directional buoy measurements. The\n\nmain advantage that this technique has is that it is conceptually simple and it is based\n\non the parametric representation of the directional sea spectrum. Some examples of\n\nthis method are provided in: (HUA; PALMQUIST, 1994), where the authors adopted\n\na variational method to estimate the optimal values of the spectrum parameters using\n\nthe full-scale data measurements carried out on a ro/ro ship. Another work based in\n\nthis approach is presented by Tannuri et al. (2003), who used the data from on-board\n\nmotion measurements of a moored FPSO and the directional sea spectrum estimations\n\nwere obtained by means of a parametric model.\n\nThe parametric modelling has gained increasing attention in recent years. For ex-\n\nample, in (MONTAZERI; NIELSEN, 2014) the authors used the parametric approach to\n\nestimate the directional wave spectrum, fitting a standard JONSWAP spectrum, from full-\n\nscale response measurements carried out on a container ship. One additional example of\n\nthe parametric modelling approach can be found in (MONTAZERI; NIELSEN; JENSEN,\n\n2015), which presented a methodology that upgraded the estimation procedure by means\n\nof introducing the trends identified in the parameters of the wave spectrum model. These\n\ntrends were identified in an analysis that was carried out in parallel with the main wave\n\ninference estimation routine. In this work the authors obtained good agreement between\n\nthe estimations and wave radar measurements of the sea state. Finally, (MONTAZERI;\n\nNIELSEN; JENSEN, 2016) stands as another recent work in which a parametric model\n\nwas adopted for estimating wind seas and swells based on measured ship motions.\n\n\n\n21\n\nAlternatively, another line of works proposes the estimation of the directional wave\n\nspectrum based on non-parametric methods. The inference is then made using the wave\n\nbuoy analogy, which relies on a comparison between measurements of response spectra\n\nand calculated ones. (WEBSTER; DILLINGHAM, 1981) is one of the first studies es-\n\ntimating the directional wave spectrum using on-board measured ship motions. In this\n\ncase the wave spectrum was estimated using a linear programming approach. Thus, the\n\nmethodology proposed provided accurate estimations in the frequency range where the re-\n\nsponse amplitude operators of the ship were linear and had some directional dependence.\n\nAnother example is provided by Hirayama (1987), where the sea spectrum was computed\n\nby means of the Maximum Likelihood Method, based on the real-scale measured ship\n\nmotions. A current example of this approach is provided in (NIELSEN; GALEAZZI;\n\nBRODTKORB, 2016), where the authors evaluated a novel concept for wave estimation\n\nadopting the wave buoy analogy using model-scale measurements. The approach adopted\n\nin this case was formulated directly in the time-domain combining different techniques\n\nand the least squares fitting to estimate wave amplitude and phase. The results obtained\n\nduring the study showed that the statistical parameters were accurately estimated when\n\ncompared with the measurements obtained through waves probes.\n\nRegarding the directional wave spectrum estimation based on the so-called VMB\n\nBayesian modelling, it was proposed in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000), for a ship with forward\n\nspeed. In order to validate the technique proposed, towing tank experiments and on-\n\nboard measurements were carried out by the authors. This approach has been adopted\n\nalso by Nielsen (2006), who presented derivations of both parametric and non-parametric\n\ntheories. The theories for both methods were applied in order to obtain the directional\n\nwave spectrum using the motions of a container ship. The estimations obtained with\n\nthese methods were compared to measurements made by a wave radar , obtaining good\n\nagreement between both approaches. The same researcher carried out a detailed study\n\n(NIELSEN, 2007) of numerical simulations of wave records, providing an estimation of\n\nthe sea state parameters. In his work, two approaches were considered: The parametric\n\nprocedure and the non-parametric one. The paper finally concluded that it is difficult\n\nto favor a particular method since both render similar results. A common feature of\n\nthe Bayesian wave inference approach as adopted in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000), (NIELSEN,\n\n2006) and (NIELSEN, 2007), is that the prior distribution is computed using the Akaike\u2019s\n\n\n\n22\n\nBayesian Information Criterion (AKAIKE, 1980). However, Iseki (2012) showed that this\n\napproach may not provide optimal values for the prior parameters, for sea conditions\n\nfor which non-linear effects begin to be relevant and, consequently, the uncertainties\n\nassociated to the response amplitude operators are increased.\n\nFollowing a similar approach, (SIMOS et al., 2010) presented a complete analysis of\n\nthe sea states estimated from the motions of a model-scale FPSO. These estimations were\n\nperformed using the Bayesian inference method with three prior parameters, analogous to\n\nthe method proposed by Nielsen (2008), but with a relevant conceptual change. Different\n\nfrom the original proposal where the hyperparameters were estimated by means of the\n\nABIC method (TANNURI et al., 2003), the authors set a pre-calibration of these hyper-\n\nparameters, meaning that their values were prescribed for each wave estimation. From a\n\nconceptual point of view, although the mathematical structure of the Bayesian model was\n\npreserved, an important feature of the Bayesian approach was abandoned, i.e. the adop-\n\ntion of an information criterion for searching the best calibration of the prior parameters\n\nin each estimation event. A detailed description of the procedure followed to calibrate\n\nthese hyperparameters can be found in (BISPO, 2011a) and in (BISPO, 2011b). This\n\napproach led to a much more expedite estimation procedure while the results obtained in\n\nthe experimental campaign attested that the wave conditions could still be inferred with\n\ngood accuracy.\n\nLater, Simos et al. (2012) utilized full-scale data measurements from a FPSO oper-\n\nating in Brazil\u2019s Campos basin for a first evaluation of the performance of this method\n\nin field conditions. However, due to the lack of alternative wave sensors, the compar-\n\nison of the results was made almost exclusively with hindcast measurements provided\n\nby NOAA for the same region where the FPSO was operating. The authors concluded\n\nthat the method was capable of inferring the sea states with a good agreement with the\n\nNOAA measurements, despite the inherent limitations concerning the estimation of sea\n\nstates with low peak periods. Bispo et al. (2016) provide another feasibility study of\n\nthe methodology proposed in (SIMOS et al., 2010); for this purpose the first part of the\n\nresults from a new field campaign, started in December 2014, was presented. Again, re-\n\nsults were obtained from full-scale FPSO motions using the Bayesian inference approach\n\nwith three pre-calibrated hyperparameters. The performance of the VMB wave inference\n\nmethod is checked against the wave estimations provided by a commercial marine radar\n\n\n\n23\n\nsystem. Comparison between both systems attest an adequate identification of the wave\n\nconditions.\n\nAssessing the feasibility of a semisubmersible platform as a motion based wave sensor\n\nis the main general objective of this thesis. This topic was first investigated by Wijaya\n\n(2009). In order to validate the hypothesis that a semisubmersible platform can be used\n\nas a VMB wave sensor, his work was mostly based on model-scale tests of the A?sgard-B\n\nsemisubmersible platform, which has also been adopted as a case-study for this thesis.\n\nThe tests assessed in Wijaya (2009) were conducted in the Marintek facilities with the\n\nmodel subjected to waves, wind and currents. Since the experimental campaign was car-\n\nried out under combined environmental conditions (waves, wind and current), the model\n\nof the platform included the submerged lines (riser and moorings) as well the topside.\n\nNevertheless, only a short range of wave conditions was evaluated due to the fact that the\n\nanalysis was based on a set of final design tests. The author also assessed some full-scale\n\nresults but these were limited because concerned a short period of time and only included\n\nmild wave conditions. With regard to the modelling approach followed, the estimation\n\nof the sea spectrum was obtained using the parametric modelling. In order to properly\n\nevaluate the accuracy of the results obtained with this inference approach, model-scale\n\nresults were compared to measurements obtained in the wave basin. Measurements from\n\nwave radar and buoy were adopted as the paradigm for the full-scale estimations. In\n\ngeneral, the author concluded that the results, for model-scale and real-scale, shown good\n\nagreement with the measurements of the significant wave height. Nevertheless, the author\n\npointed out that significant discrepancies regarding the mean direction and peak period\n\nwere noticeable. Also, some deviations (over-estimation) can be observed for the inferred\n\nvalues of the significant wave height. Finally, as a consequence of the discrepancies re-\n\nported between the estimations and the measurements, the author concluded that further\n\nresearch should be conducted in order to determine if a semisubmersible platform can be\n\nadopted as a VMB wave sensor.\n\nIn the present study, a scaled model of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible unit was built,\n\nand tested in a large set of experimental conditions at the wave basin in the TPN-USP\n\nwave basin. They were specifically conceived for verifying the feasibility of performing the\n\nVMB wave inference estimations, putting a special emphasis on severe wave conditions,\n\nand its frequency range limitations when this type of offshore platforms is adopted as a\n\n\n\n24\n\nwave sensor.\n\nOn the other hand, further attention should be paid to the mathematical basis of\n\nthe problem, which, in principle, consists of an inverse problem in which the input (sea\n\nspectrum) has to be estimated from the measured output data (floater motions), by means\n\nof the Bayesian modelling approach. The conventional methodology adopted in the works\n\ndescribed above does not include the inherent uncertainties in the estimates of the ship\n\nresponse functions. A first step in this attempt was made by Iseki (2012), who addressed\n\nthis challenge with an error matrix, composed of products of the response functions and\n\nthe estimation errors, achieving a modified Gaussian stochastic linear regression model\n\nby the summation of the RAO matrix and the error matrix (C).\n\nFull-scale ship motion data was used to validate the modified Bayesian procedure\n\nproposed, and Iseki (2012) showed that this alternative approach provides improved esti-\n\nmations of the different sea conditions and increases the reliability of the hyperparameters\n\nestimated by means of the ABIC.\n\nThis thesis includes several references to other wave monitoring systems, such as buoys\n\nand marine radar systems. Although the study and characterization of these systems are\n\nnot in the scope of this work, a brief review is needed, regarding the mathematical models\n\ncommonly adopted and their main drawbacks. Traditionally, wave measurements have\n\nbeen carried out by means of directional wave buoys. These are floating devices equipped\n\nwith different measuring systems (including accelerometers and inclinometers). Thus,\n\nwave measurements can be obtained using the recorded signals of the measuring sys-\n\ntems. Usually, the approach followed to estimate the sea spectrum characteristics is the\n\nparametrical modelling, see for example (HASSELMANN; DUNCKEL; EWING, 1980)\n\nor (ALLENDER et al., 1989). The possible drawbacks of this measurement system have\n\nbeen described in chapter 1. In addition to directional wave buoys, wave radar systems\n\nhave gained notorious popularity as a wave monitoring system. In general, they pro-\n\nvide accurate measurements and information about the sea spectrum in a wide frequency\n\nrange. However, in extreme sea conditions, as it has been pointed out before, these sys-\n\ntems may present different shortcomings (MAGNUSSON, 2008) that generate imprecise\n\nmeasurements of the wave heights and the energy distribution. One may realize that both\n\nsystems have a common shortcoming regarding the inaccurate estimations of extreme sea\n\n\n\n25\n\nconditions, that leads to divergent inferred values for the same sea conditions. Accord-\n\ningly, the recover of reliable estimations of the sea spectrum characteristics in extreme sea\n\nstates is one of the main motivations to use a large semisubmersible platform as a VMB\n\nwave sensor, as discussed by Wijaya (2009).\n\nFinally, it should be stressed that this section has not included a detailed review of\n\nthe works related to the Bayesian inference approach; this is due to the fact that the most\n\nprominent literature references have been included in the bulk text of section 4, where\n\nthe method fundamentals are also covered.\n\n\n\n26\n\n3 LINEAR MODELLING OF OCEAN WAVES\n\nAND WAVE INDUCED RESPONSES OF\n\nFLOATING OFFSHORE STRUCTURES\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nSince the methodology investigated in the present thesis aims to determine the sea\n\nconditions based on the platform motions, the accuracy of the output is associated with\n\nthe hypotheses and simplifications regarding the wave description and the responses of\n\nthe floating platform. In particular, this technique is strongly sensitive to the precision\n\nof the model adopted to estimate the vessel responses. For this reason, this chapter aims\n\nat providing a brief review of the hypotheses and properties related to the description of\n\nocean waves and the induced responses of the vessel.\n\n3.2 Description of ocean waves\n\nThe proper description of ocean waves is of interest to the dynamics of ships and\n\noffshore structures. In normal conditions the sea surface comprises a large number of waves\n\nwith different lengths, heights and directions. As a direct result of this heterogeneity, the\n\nwater surface elevation cannot be described by means of a deterministic mathematical\n\nexpression. A common approach adopted to describe the sea surface elevation is to assume\n\nthat it is given by the superposition of many simple, regular wave components, each one\n\nwith its own amplitude, length, frequency and direction of propagation. This concept (also\n\nknown as the superposition principle) was first adopted in (DENIS; PIERSON, 1953) to\n\ndescribe the behavior of the sea surface in terms of a simple theory of regular waves.\n\nRegarding the characterization of regular waves, it is based on major waves theories,\n\nsuch as Airy linear wave theory, that were developed during the 19th century. The re-\n\n\n\n27\n\nsults of these theories are also of central importance for solving the seakeeping problem.\n\nTherefore, the most relevant definitions and theory used to describe the regular waves are\n\ndiscussed in the following section. In this case, due to the fact that only a brief review\n\nis provided, the reader is referred to (NEWMAN, 1977) for a detailed and systematical\n\ndescription of the theory and formulae.\n\n3.2.1 Regular waves\n\nFigure 3.1 shows the main features and characteristics adopted to define the regular\n\nwaves. As a matter of fact, this figure provides the wave profile, ?, accordingly to the\n\ndistance, x, for a given instant of time, t. It is worth remembering that the coordinate\n\nsystem is placed at the still water level (SWL) with the y-axis directed upward and the\n\nx-axis is positive in the direction of wave propagation.\n\nFigure 3.1: Harmonic wave definitions.\n\nEven though the regular wave constitutes the simplest component of an irregular sea,\n\nsome assumptions are still needed to develop a theory that describes it. In the following,\n\nthe assumptions in which this approach is based are provided.\n\n1. The flow is assumed to be 2-dimensional;\n\n2. The flow can be described by the velocity potential, ?;\n\n3. The flow can be considered as irrotational flow, i.e. vorticity ?\u00d7 u = 0. It is\n\nimportant to remember that this condition does not apply where flow separation\n\noccurs;\n\n\n\n28\n\n4. Fluid motion in the ocean can be assumed as a potential flow, which is formally\n\ncharacterized by:\n\n\u2022 The velocity can be described in terms of a scalar potential,\n\nu(x,y,z,t) = ??(x,y,z,t) , (3.1)\n\n\u2022 The velocity potential must fulfil the following form of the continuity equation,\n\nalso known as the Laplace equation, given by,\n\n?2? = 0 , (3.2)\n\n\u2022 The resulting momentum equation is,\n\np(x,y,z,t)\n\n?\n= ?\n\n??\n\n? t\n?\n\n1\n\n2\n|??|2 ?gy . (3.3)\n\nwhere p is the pressure and ? and g stand for the density of the water and the\n\ngravity constants, respectively.\n\n5. Small wave amplitudes are assumed: This hypothesis is equivalent to state that\n\nA\n?\n<&lt;1. Thus, resulting in ?\n\n?2 T\n<&lt;1.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to solve the Laplace equation for the velocity potential,\n\ngiven certain boundary conditions (BCs). This linear description of the propagation\n\ngravity waves is commonly known as the linearized (Airy) wave theory.\n\nRegarding the BCs, deep water condition is assumed1, that is equivalent to set ?? ?\n\n0, for y ? ??. This condition has been adopted due to the fact that it results in a\n\nsimple solution of the velocity potential, which equally illustrates the main assumptions\n\nand simplifications adopted in this theory. Again, (NEWMAN, 1977) is provided as the\n\nmain reference for a detailed review of the problem including the BC for y = ?H.\n\nNow, it is necessary to describe the behavior of the free surface. For this purpose two\n\ndifferent BCs are endorsed:\n\n1. Kinematic BC: It is assumed that the normal component of water velocity at water\n\nsurface is the same as the normal component of the velocity of the surface. In other\n\n1In the linear wave theory the water conditions are considered to be deep if the water depth, H, is\nmore than half the wave length, ?, so: H\n\n?\n> 1\n\n2\nor ?\n\nH\n&lt;2.\n\n\n\n29\n\nwords, this BC is equivalent to accept that water particles at the surface stay on\n\nthe free surface and that the flow has to be tangential at the free surface. Formally,\n\nthis condition is given by,\n\n??\n\n? t\n=\n??\n\n? y\n? u \u00b7?? . (3.4)\n\n2. Dynamic BC: The pressure on the both sides of the surface is equal. Which is\n\nequivalent to assume that in the free surface the hydrodynamic pressure (p) equals\n\nthe atmospheric pressure (pa). This relation can be expressed by means of the\n\nmomentum equation,\n\n?\n1\n\n?\n(p?pa) =\n\n??\n\n? t\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n[?? \u00b7??] + g? = 0 , (3.5)\n\nNow, in virtue of the small amplitude assumption (A\n?\n<&lt;1), it can be shown\n\nthat slopes of the wave profile, i.e.\n??\n\n? x\n, are small quantities compared to one.\n\nMoreover, the derivatives of the velocity potential are small first order-quantities, as\n\na consequence of the fact that the fluid velocity can be assumed as a small quantity\n\nproportional to the wave motion. Therefore, the non-linear terms in Eqs. (3.4)\n\nand (3.5) can be neglected. In such conditions, the resulting formal expressions of\n\nthe linearized BCs are,\n\n??\n\n? t\n=\n??\n\n? y\n. (3.6)\n\n? = ?\n1\n\ng\n\n??\n\n? t\n. (3.7)\n\nThese BCs can be presented together in a more elegant form. Thus, combining\n\nEq. (3.6) with Eq. (3.7),\n\n?2?\n\n? t2\n+ g\n\n??\n\n? y\n= 0 . (3.8)\n\nBefore taking any further steps, it is important to highlight that the resulting BCs\n\n\n\n30\n\nadopted to describe the behavior of the sea surface are characterized by two linearizing\n\nhypothesis: (i) non-linear terms of the dynamic BC have been omitted (thus, highlighting\n\nthe importance of the hypothesis of small wave amplitudes) and (ii) the BCs are applied\n\nat y = 0 (SWL) and not to y = ?(x,t).\n\nThe straightforward velocity potential that fulfils the Laplace equation as well as the\n\nBCs described is given by,\n\n? =\ngA\n\n?\neky sin(kx?? t) . (3.9)\n\nwhere k stands for the wave number and ? for the wave frequency. Thus, the general\n\nform of the free surface elevation can be expressed as,\n\n?(x,t) = A cos(k x?? t) . (3.10)\n\nAs it was stated previously, the relevance of this theory is well illustrated by the prin-\n\nciple adopted to describe the irregular waves, which allows the representation of irregular\n\ntimes series of the sea surface elevation as the result of the linear superposition of many\n\n(regular) waves, each one with different phase shift, ?i, amplitude and frequency. This\n\nlinearization can be formally expressed as,\n\n?(x,t) =\nN?\ni=1\n\n?i =\nN?\ni=1\n\nAi cos(ki x??it + ?i) . (3.11)\n\nwhere each ?i is derived by means of combining Eq. (3.7) and (3.9). For instance, the\n\nregular waves included in Eq. (3.11) can be characterized using the theory discussed in\n\nthis section. A detailed review of the main methodology followed to characterize the\n\nocean surface elevation is provided in the following.\n\n3.2.2 Irregular waves\n\nThe reader must be already aware of the fact that the description of the ocean waves\n\nis a topic of major significance for the purpose of this thesis. An analysis regarding the\n\nbackground of the regular waves has been provided in the previous section. This method-\n\nology, however, does not characterize the sea surface elevation by itself. Altogether, it\n\n\n\n31\n\nhas been discussed that the sea surface is a non-deterministic process in space and time,\n\nthus the probabilistic approach is commonly adopted in order to describe its main char-\n\nacteristics. The major fundamentals of the approach discussed hereafter are thoroughly\n\ndescribed in the literature, e.g. (BISHOP; PRICE, 1979) or (GODA, 2000).\n\nIn order to obtain a realistic idea of the wave forces acting on offshore structures, the\n\nsea surface elevation is considered as a time-space dependent random process (GODA,\n\n2000). An illustration of the statistical characteristics of this process has been provided\n\nin appendix A, which consists of an analysis of a sinusoidal wave as a random process.\n\nHowever, the characterization of a random process is relatively complex. Considering\n\nthe properties discussed in appendix A, the sea surface elevation can be assumed as a\n\nstationary, homogeneous and ergodic random process2. As a result of these hypotheses,\n\nthe probability density function of the surface elevation is the same for different records,\n\ngiven that the statistical properties remain constant for any (sufficiently long) time span\n\nand location.\n\nThese assumptions make it possible to characterize the sea condition from a single\n\nwave record. The common approach is the use of power spectral density (PSD) estimators,\n\nwhich are based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the wave record and that are in\n\naccordance with the model described in Eq. (3.11). In sea wave analysis, the use of the\n\nFFT stands as the most practical way to estimate the PSD, providing good frequency\n\nresolution. However, the ideal method should provide high resolution regarding rapid\n\ntemporal changes in analytic state variables for frequency, phase and amplitude. These\n\ncharacteristics of the analysis can be obtained, for example, by means of the Hilbert\n\nTransform. It has to be said, however, that both methods give similar results when\n\napplied to signals having relatively long durations, as is the case in sea wave analysis. As\n\na consequence of the similarity of the outputs when applied to signals that are relatively\n\nlong and for practical purposes, in this thesis the power spectral density estimations will\n\nbe computed using models based on the FFT of the measurements.\n\nThe description of the wave energy distribution over the frequency and direction\n\nranges is provided by the directional energy wave density spectrum, S??(?,?), which\n\nstands as an statistical characteristic of the sea. Then, the energy density (per unit area\n\n2Appendix B also provides a broad discussion regarding these ideas.\n\n\n\n32\n\nof the sea surface) of a given sea state within these ranges can be computed from this\n\nspectrum as follows,\n\nE = ?g\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n? +?\n??\n\nS??(?,?)d?d? , (3.12)\n\nReturning to the Fourier analysis, it widely known that it allows the description of the\n\nsurface elevation as the sum of infinite waves for all possible combinations of frequencies in\n\nNk directions, leading to the Longuet-Higgins model (see, once again, appendix A) which\n\nis similar to the one presented in Eq. (3.11) to describe the irregular wave elevation,\n\n?(x, t) =\n\nNk?\nj=1\n\nN????\ni=1\n\nAji cos(kji \u00b7 x ??i t + ?i) , (3.13)\n\nwhere the wave number vector kji = ki(cos(?j), sin(?j)) has magnitude ki and the ran-\n\ndomness of the process is obtained by means of random phases, ?i. Therefore, making\n\nuse of the central limit theorem, it is assumed that the sea surface elevation has a normal\n\ndistribution.\n\nAccordingly, the energy density can be computed as the sum of the energy of the wave\n\ncomponents of Eq. (3.13),\n\nE = ?g\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n? +?\n0\n\nS??(?,?)d?d? = ?g\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n? +?\n0\n\nA2(?,?)\n\n2\nd?d? , (3.14)\n\nwhich provides a relation between the sea energy spectrum and the amplitudes of the\n\nwaves that compose it. Thus, the following equivalence exists between S??(?,?) and the\n\namplitudes of the individual regular waves,\n\nS??(?,?)d?d? =\n\n?+d??\n?\n\n?+d??\n?\n\nA2(?,?)\n\n2\n. (3.15)\n\nThe assumptions adopted regarding the sea surface (it is stationary, narrow banded\n\nand Gaussian distributed) allow the adoption of the Rayleigh distribution to characterize\n\nthe probability of the wave amplitude. A comprehensive discussion of the Rayleigh distri-\n\nbution and how it is related to the Normal probability distribution function is provided\n\n\n\n33\n\nin (BENDAT; PIERSOL, 2010)3.\n\nAs it has been pointed out earlier, the spectral density function allows the statistical\n\ncharacterization of any sea state and it is usually described in a parametric way based on\n\nsome statistical parameters of the waves. Some common ones are provided herein.\n\n3This model is correct when the number of waves components tends to infinity (see Goda (2000)).\nHowever, a common practice is to obtain the sea conditions using a finite number of sinusoidal waves,\nproducing series that have their variance bounded and, consequently, that are neither Gaussian nor\nergodic (TUCKER; CHALLENOR; CARTER, 1984). Notwithstanding this, it is widely known that the\nstatistical distribution of the individual wave heights is well approximated by a Rayleigh distribution.\nThus, herein an analysis is provided, regarding the expected distribution of S??(fi) = S??i and its\nvariance, when the number of components in the Longuet-Higgins model tends to infinity.\n\nLet s??i :=\n1\n2\nA2 = S??(fi)? fi. Also, it is now known that A is Rayleigh distributed, thus its probability\n\ndensity function can be written as,\n\npdf(A) =\nA\n\n?2\nexp\n\n(\n?\nA2\n\n2?2\n\n)\n,\n\nThe change-of-variable technique can be used as follows,\n\npdf(A)dA = pdf(s??i )ds??i , where\ndA\n\nds??i\n=\n\n1\n\nA\n,\n\nLeading to,\n\npdf(s??i ) =\n1\n\n?2\nexp\n\n(\n?\ns??i\n?2\n\n)\n,\n\nTherefore, s??i has an exponential distribution. Regarding the variance, following (OCHI, 1990) it can\nbe rewritten as,\n\nVar(s??i ) = E[(s??i )\n2] ?E2[s??i ] = ?\n\n4 ,\n\nThus the coefficient of variation is,\n\nCoV(s??i ) =\n\n(\nVar(s??i )\n\nE2[s??i ]\n\n)1\n2\n\n= 1 ,\n\nMeaning that the standard deviation of an exponential distribution is equal to its mean. Finally, if the\nspectrum, S??, is estimated from a real Gaussian process,\n\nE[S??i ] =\n?2\n\n? f\n= S??i .\n\nwhere S??i is the averaged spectrum of the spectra, S, for the i\nth frequency, obtained for each realization,\n\n?(t), of the same process.\nBut, in this ideal condition the coefficient of variation is 1 (CoV(S??i ) = 1), for a ? f = const.\nFor the analysis of practical (time-limited) wave records this quantity provides a measurement of the\n\nexpected variance of each component of the spectrum. In order to have a clear idea of the origin of this\nvariance a brief explanation is provided. A random process can be featured by a continuous spectrum,\nin other words, the measured signal (recorded over a extremely long period of time) is the result of the\nsum of a large number of components closely spaced in frequency and with random phases. If a short\nrecord of the signal is now taken, each harmonic of the spectrum splits its energy amongst the adjacent\ncomponents of the spectrum, as described in (SHIN; HAMMOND, 2008). Therefore, each harmonic is\ngiven by a large number of contributions which are random in phase. Thus, the amplitude of a particular\nharmonic is to some extent random. Consequently, the analysis of different records of the same signal\nis expected to result in a fluctuation of the amplitude of the harmonics from analysis to analysis. This\n\n\n\n34\n\nSignificant Wave Height\n\nThe significant wave height or the mean value of the highest third of the waves, is\n\ncomputed as provided in Eq. (3.16).\n\nHs = 3\n\n? +?\n1\n3\n\nh2\n\n4m0\nexp\n\n(\nh2\n\n8m0\n\n)\ndh = 4.0043(m0)\n\n1\n2 ? 4(m0)\n\n1\n2 , (3.16)\n\nwhere the variance is computed as ?2 = m0 =\n? 2?\n\n0\n\n? +?\n0\n\nS??(?,?)d?d?, moment of order\n\nzero4 of S??. Traditionally, the significant wave height has been adopted as a typical\n\nmeasure of the energy of the sea spectrum. However, this quantity, by itself, does not\n\nprovide information regarding the energy distribution in the frequency range.\n\nSuch distribution is described by means of statistical wave periods. Most common\n\nperiods are:\n\nPeak Period\n\nThis period, Tp, is the wave period with the highest energy.\n\nMean Wave Period\n\nThe mean wave period, T1, is defined as the mean value of all wave periods in a wave\n\nrecord representing a certain sea state. This period is associated to the frequency that\n\ncorresponds to the spectral centroid of the wave spectrum and it can be estimated as,\n\nT1 = 2?\nm0\nm1\n\n, (3.17)\n\nwhere the first spectral moment of S?? is given by m1 =\n? 2?\n\n0\n\n? +?\n0\n\n? S??(?,?)d?d?.\n\nMean Zero Up-Crossing Period\n\nAdditionally, the expected value of the zero up-crossing period stands for the average\n\nperiod of zero-crossing waves. It can be associated to the frequency that represents the\n\nradius of gyration around ? = 0 of the area under the spectrum and its value is computed\n\nby means of the zeroth and second order spectral moments as shown below,\n\nresult will be important to understand the Gaussian hypothesis and its implications.\n4Regarding the moment of order nth, it can be computed as mn =\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n? +?\n0\n\n?n S??(?,?)d?d?.\n\n\n\n35\n\nT2 = 2?\n\n(\nm0\nm2\n\n)1\n2\n\n, (3.18)\n\nFigure 3.2 provides an illustration of the wave spectrum (in the period domain) and\n\nsome of the statistical parameters discussed, i.e. the Peak period, Mean wave period and\n\nMean zero up-crossing period.\n\nFigure 3.2: Illustration of the Peak period, Mean wave period and Mean zero up-crossing\nperiod.\n\nIn section 1.1.2, it has been pointed out that the vessel may be intended as a kind\n\nof low-pass filter, filtering the wave components that do not excite the vessels responses.\n\nThis results in one of the major limitations that the VMB wave inference method presents.\n\nConsequently, the mean wave period has been used in different works as a measure of the\n\naccuracy of the estimation, e.g. (SIMOS et al., 2010, 2012) and (BISPO et al., 2016).\n\nUnlike Tp, this statistical parameter is more sensitive to the energies placed in the high\n\nfrequency range and allows an accurate assessment of the inferred sea conditions.\n\n3.2.2.1 Note on standard wave spectrum models\n\nThe sea states are generally characterized by their PSD. A common approach is to\n\nadopt a standard wave spectrum model among the ones that are used to represent the\n\npower spectral density in the frequency-domain, S??(?). There are various idealized spec-\n\ntra that are used nowadays in oceanography and ocean engineering. Perhaps the simplest\n\n\n\n36\n\nis that proposed in (PIERSON; WILLARD; MOSKOWITZ, 1964), also known as the\n\nPierson-Moskowitz (PM) wave spectrum. Other commonly adopted wave spectra are\n\nthe Bretschneider (BS) wave spectrum (BRETSCHNEIDER, 1959) and the JONSWAP\n\n(HASSELMANN; DUNCKEL; EWING, 1980) wave spectrum. Furthermore, some of\n\nthese standard wave spectra allow the adjustment of the wave energy distribution through\n\nthe bandwidth by means of different parameters. Thus, leading to sea spectra that present\n\nbroader or narrower energy distribution of the ocean waves in accordance with the devel-\n\nopment stage that sea being modelled presents.\n\nRegarding the directional wave spectrum, S??(?,?), it can be obtained by multiplying\n\nthe PSD, S??(?), by a directional spread function, D(?,?). This functional represents the\n\ndirectional distribution of wave energy. As an example, the Mitsuyasu type directional\n\nspreading function is provided next (GODA, 2000). Mathematically, it is given by,\n\nS??(?,?) = S??(?) D(?,?) , (3.19)\n\nD(?,?) = G(s) cos2s\n\n?\n?? ??0\n\n2\n\n?\n? . (3.20)\n\nwhere the parameter s determines the directional spread of the spectrum and ?0 stands\n\nas the main direction. The function G(s) is only a normalizing factor used to guarantee\n\nan unitary integral, thus, it must fulfil the following condition,\n\nG(s) ?\n? 2?\n\n0\n\nD(?,?)d? = 1 . (3.21)\n\nFor illustrative purposes, Fig. 3.3 provides an example for the directional spread func-\n\ntion and the PSD. The combination of this spread function and a JONSWAP wave spec-\n\ntrum (with Hs = 1m and Tp = 14s) leads to the directional wave spectrum shown in\n\nFig. 3.4. It is worth to remember that knowledge of the directional distribution of the\n\nenergy of sea waves is still limited because of the difficulty in making reliable field mea-\n\nsurements and, as a consequence, the establishment of a standard functional form for the\n\ndirectional wave spectrum has not been achieved yet, in contrast to the case of the PSD,\n\nS??(?). Therefore, the functionals commonly adopted to model the directional energy\n\n\n\n37\n\ndistribution are adapted to a limited database of measurements and basically consider\n\na smooth distribution of the energy, including different parameters to set how wide the\n\npeak of the wave spectrum must be.\n\nDirection [rad.]\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nD\n(!\n\n,-\n)\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2\n\nW\na\nve\n\n S\np\n\ne\nct\n\nra\nl D\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n [\nm\n\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFigure 3.3: Example of cosine-squared directional spread function (left) and the power\nspectral density (right).\n\n0.2\n0.15\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n0.1\n0.05\n\n0\n\n2\nDirection [rad.]\n\n4\n\n6\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0.2\n\nW\na\nve\n\n S\np\ne\nct\n\nra\nl D\n\ne\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\nm\n\n2\n r\n\na\nd\n./\nH\n\nz]\n\nFigure 3.4: Example of directional energy spectrum.\n\nThe approach described above reflects the methodology adopted traditionally to char-\n\nacterize the sea states, resulting in directional wave spectra that are regarded as unimodal\n\n(with energy concentrated mainly on the wind direction). However, field measurements\n\n\n\n38\n\nhave already demonstrated that the energy of short waves tends to be accumulated along\n\ntwo or more off-wind directions, generating double (or multiple) directional distributions.\n\nSeveral works, e.g. (OCHI; HUBBLE, 1977; GARCIA-GABIN, 2015; TOFFOLI et al.,\n\n2010) and (TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004), provide a detailed discussion and char-\n\nacterization of these bimodal directional wave spectra. Accordingly, some spectral models\n\nhave been developed to give a realistic approach for double peak cases in the frequency-\n\ndomain, such as the bimodal spectral model formulated in (OCHI; HUBBLE, 1977) (which\n\nis an extension of the BS wave spectrum) and the model developed in (TORSETHAU-\n\nGEN, 1993), which are referred as Ochi-Hubble and Torsethaugen wave spectrum repec-\n\ntively.\n\nIn this thesis, the assessment of the use of a semisubmersible platform as a motion\n\nbased wave sensor has been carried out using a scale model of the A?sgard-B semisub-\n\nmersible platform (see section 1.1.2). Therefore, aiming at generating compelling results,\n\nthe sea spectrum models adopted to generate the irregular sea in the wave basin cor-\n\nrespond to: The JONSWAP and Torsethaugen wave spectra, which stand as the most\n\nrepresentative wave spectrum models for the sea condition observed in the Norwegian con-\n\ntinental shelf. Although these spectra are widely documented in the literature, a succinct\n\ndescription of their formulae is provided in appendix C.\n\nMoreover, Fig. 3.5 shows a comparison between the Torsethaugen spectrum and JON-\n\nSWAP spectrum for the same sea condition, with significant wave height equal to 1m and\n\nspectral peak period of 12.6s. From this figure, one may realize that the main difference\n\nbetween these spectrum models is the energy distribution along the wave frequency axis.\n\nOn the one hand, the energy is concentrated near the peak of the spectrum in the JON-\n\nSWAP model and less on frequencies further away from the peak. On the other hand,\n\nTorsethaugen spectrum is a bimodal sea spectrum composed by a swell (energy around the\n\npeak in the low frequency range) and locally generated wind waves (energy components\n\ngiven in the high frequency range).\n\nIn order to illustrate the quantitative differences between the JONSWAP and the\n\nTorsethaugen spectrum Tab. 3.1 provides some statistical characteristics of these spectra\n\nfor different sea conditions. In this case, the Torsethaugen characteristics have been\n\nnormalized by the correspondent statistical features of the JONSWAP wave spectrum,\n\n\n\n39\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5\n\nW\na\nve\n\n S\np\ne\nct\n\nra\nl D\n\ne\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\nm\n\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\nTorsethaugen\nJONSWAP\n\nFigure 3.5: Wave spectrum models comparison.\n\nfor the same sea condition. The statistics provided include the variance of the wave train\n\ngiven by the area under the spectrum (m0), the mean wave period (T1) and the median\n\nwave period, or T1\n2\n. Concerning the median wave period, it is related to the frequency that\n\nexactly divides the spectrum into two equal parts (in the frequency-domain). Therefore,\n\nthis period also provides meaningful information of the energy distribution being, at the\n\nsame time, less sensitive to the extreme values than T1. The period, T1\n2\n, is given by,\n\nm0\n2\n\n=\n\n? f1\n2\n\n0\n\nS??(?)d? , where T1\n2\n\n=\n1\n\nf1\n2\n\n. (3.22)\n\nIt is worth remembering that in this thesis the area calculation for each wave spectrum\n\nhas been done by integrating the wave spectrum curve by means of a trapezoidal method.\n\nThe results provided in Tab. 3.1 show that JONSWAP wave spectrum has a slightly\n\nsmaller area if compared with the Torsethaugen spectrum. Such differences have also\n\nbeen reported in other works, e.g. (TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004) and (WIJAYA,\n\n2009). The origin of these differences may be explained, for moderate and high sea states,\n\nby the fact that the high frequency tail of the simplified Torsethaugen spectrum model\n\nseems to fall off slower (it is proportional to the ?4 exponential) than the reference spec-\n\n\n\n40\n\ntrum. Therefore, for the simplified model of the Torsethaugen spectrum proposed in\n\n(TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004), narrow differences between the outputs are consid-\n\nered acceptable when the same sea condition is modelled through different wave spectrum\n\nmodels. Regarding the mean wave period and the median wave period, Torsethaugen\n\nspectrum always provides lower values than JONSWAP, as expected, due to the fact that\n\nthe energy is usually concentrated in the high frequency range. Finally, another feature\n\nof the statistics provided is the fact that median period is always greater than the mean\n\nperiod, as expected.\n\nTable 3.1: Wave spectrum properties\n\nJONSWAP Torsethaugen\nHs Tp m0 (m\n\n2) T1 (s) T1\n2\n\n(s) m?0 T\n?\n1 T\n\n?\n1\n2\n\n1.00 12.60 0.06 9.73 10.83 1.01 0.61 0.64\n3.50 13.50 0.06 10.42 11.63 1.02 0.79 0.88\n3.50 15.50 0.77 11.97 13.29 1.01 0.69 0.73\n3.50 18.50 0.77 14.28 15.86 1.00 0.58 0.59\n4.50 14.50 0.77 11.24 12.56 1.02 0.79 0.86\n5.50 9.50 1.26 7.81 8.87 1.02 0.94 0.98\n5.50 18.50 1.89 14.28 15.86 1.00 0.65 0.68\n6.50 16.50 1.89 12.86 14.41 1.01 0.76 0.81\n7.50 18.50 2.64 14.35 15.99 1.00 0.70 0.74\n9.50 16.50 3.51 13.13 14.83 1.02 0.83 0.91\n9.90 18.50 5.62 14.56 16.37 1.00 0.75 0.80\n11.70 18.10 6.11 14.42 16.24 1.00 0.79 0.86\n14.10 19.20 8.53 15.35 17.34 1.00 0.78 0.84\n16.40 19.50 12.40 15.70 17.79 1.00 0.80 0.85\n\nThe points addressed above would constitute a basic description of the probabilistic\n\napproach, introducing the reader to the fundamentals of the probabilistic characterization\n\nof the ocean waves. However, some questions remain unanswered, such as which is the\n\nideal time duration of the recorded wave signal to estimate the sea spectrum? and how\n\ndoes the time duration of the records affect the repeatability of the same sea spectrum?\n\nThere are some works, as for example (GODA, 2000) and (MELLO, 2005), that ana-\n\nlyze this topic and attempt to provide an appropriate methodology to estimate the ideal\n\nsample time. Nevertheless, the procedures proposed have some limitations regarding the\n\nbandwidth of the sea spectrum, specially when it comes to bimodal wave spectra. Since\n\nthis thesis does not aim at providing a systematic analysis of the probabilistic techniques\n\nto describe the ocean waves, a discussion regarding these points has been included in\n\n\n\n41\n\nappendix B, along with a guideline to define the optimal sample time for each event (sea\n\ncondition).\n\n3.3 Ship motions in waves\n\nThe main aspects of the linear modelling of floating vessel motions are described in\n\nthe following. For a detailed derivation and description of the forces and moments acting\n\non the floating body in waves the reader is referred to (NEWMAN, 1977).\n\nFirst of all, the main assumptions adopted to develop the linear modelling of the ship\n\nmotions are given by:\n\n1. When defining wave excitation, the same linear model is used as when describing\n\nthe linear wave theory, i.e. waves are assumed to have a low amplitude and slopes;\n\n2. The motions of the floating vessel (ship/platform) are assumed small;\n\n3. Hydrostatic forces and moments are represented by initial stability approximation\n\n(this assumption can be assumed as a consequence of the previous one);\n\n4. Potential flow model is used, or in other words, the flow model is inviscid and\n\nirrotational.\n\n5. The boundary layer must be thin enough to guarantee that the outer pressure\n\n(estimated by means of the potential flow model) stands as a good approximation for\n\nthe pressure acting on the body\u2019s surface (the hull of the vessel, in our case). In order\n\nto guarantee this condition high Reynolds Number are required (in typical marine\n\nengineering applications this requirement is fulfilled) as well as a small Keulegan-\n\nCarpenter number5, which ensures that separation effects can be neglected in the\n\nmost general cases;\n\n6. The quantities used to describe interaction between the hull and water are indepen-\n\ndent upon the motions.\n\nRegarding the equations of motion of the floating system, they can be derived using the\n\nsecond Newton\u2019s law,\n\n5Section 3.3.1 provides a systematical description of this quantity.\n\n\n\n42\n\n?\nF = M?? , (3.23)\n\nwhere ? = [? x,? y,? z,? ?,? ?,? ?]T are amplitudes of the vessel motions and M is mass\n\nand inertia moment matrix. Concerning the forces acting on the system, they are given\n\nby:\n\n1. The pressure force, Fp, which can be decomposed as (see (NEWMAN, 1977) and\n\n(FALTINSEN, 1993)):\n\n\u2022 The so-called Froude-Krylov excitation term: That estimates the force that\n\nwould be exerted on a fixed body by the incident waves (the vessel does not\n\naffect the incoming wave and resulting flow);\n\n\u2022 A second term also known as the diffraction part: This component takes into\n\naccount the wave deformation due to the vessel presence.\n\nIt should be emphasized that this decomposition of the resulting forces acting on\n\nthe floating platform is possible due to the assumption of small wave amplitudes\n\nand slope, and small body displacements around a reference point. Moreover, for\n\nlong waves6 the Froude-Krylov forces are dominant meanwhile in short waves both\n\nterms must be considered.\n\n2. Another component of the hydrodynamic forces acting on a floating vessel is the\n\nradiation term, referred in the following as Fh. Cummins (1962) showed that the\n\n(radiation-induced) hydrodynamic forces in an ideal fluid can be related to a added\n\nmass, a, and a potential damping, B.\n\n3. Finally, the equations of motion are completed by the total static linearized forces,\n\nwhich include the forces due to the body weight, Fhs.\n\nThus, Eq. (3.23) can be rewritten as,\n\nFp + Fh + Fhs = M?? , (3.24)\n\n6The relation between the wave length and the frequency is given by the dispersion relation (GODA,\n2000). For deep water applications (such as is the semisubmersible platform under study) the wave length\nis inversely proportional to the square of the frequency.\n\n\n\n43\n\nNow, it is assumed that the responses of the vessel are linearly related to the amplitude\n\nand slope of the regular wave, which velocity potential has been defined in Eq. (3.9).\n\nHence, the response of the 2nd ? order system can be fitted to a linear model and the\n\nsolution is sought in the frequency-domain. Accordingly, Eq. (3.24) can be transformed\n\nto the frequency-domain as follows,\n\n[M + a(?)]?? + B(?)?? + c? = ?\n{\n??2[M + a] + i? b + c\n\n}\n= A X . (3.25)\n\nwhere M is the system mass and inertia moment matrix, b represents the linear damping\n\ncoefficient, c is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient, A stands as the wave amplitude and\n\nX is the complex amplitude of the exciting force or moment7. Through Eq. (3.25) it is\n\npossible, by means of standard matrix inversion techniques, to compute the ratio ?/A.\n\nTherefore, for the jth mode, this ratio is given by,\n\nZj(?,?) =\n?j\n\nA\n=\n\n6?\ni=1\n\nXi\n\n??2[Mij + aij] + i? bij + cij\n= Aj(?,?) + iBj(?,?) . (3.26)\n\nwhere Z(?,?) stands as the complex amplitude of the body motion in response to an\n\nincident wave of unitary amplitude, frequency ? and direction of incidence, ?, of the\n\nwave in relation to the vessel (see Fig. 3.6). This function is also known as the Response\n\nAmplitude Operator (RAO) in the field of marine engineering.\n\nMoreover, it is important to highlight that in Eq. (3.26) the complex notation has been\n\nadopted (denoted by i) aiming to properly compute the phase shift between the responses\n\nof the platform and the incident waves. In the last place, Aj(?,?) and Bj(?,?) correspond\n\nto real and imaginary parts of the complex transfer function of motion Zj(?,?).\n\nFor instance, the phase angle, ?j, can be computed as,\n\n?j = arctan\n\n(\nBj\nAj\n\n)\n, (3.27)\n\nThus, the complex transfer function is rewritten as,\n\n7(NEWMAN, 1977) stands as a reference for a comprehensive description and derivation of X.\n\n\n\n44\n\nFigure 3.6: Encounter ? angle: given by the difference between the wave direction and\nthe heading of the floating vessel.\n\nZj(?,?) = |Zj(?,?)|ei?j , (3.28)\n\nIn some cases it is more convenient to define the transfer function in wave period\n\nrather than in wave frequency. Then, the equivalence is directly computed as follows,\n\nZj(?,?) = Zj\n\n(\nT =\n\n2?\n\n?\n,?\n\n)\n. (3.29)\n\nFinally, from Eq. (3.28) it is possible to compute the RAOs for a given direction\n\nand frequency range, in virtue of the superposition principle (previously discussed in\n\nsection 3.2). As for the waves, the responses of the vessel are a random process. Therefore,\n\nthe response PSD can be adopted to characterize its motions. Formally, the response\n\npower spectrum of the jth mode is related to the RAOs (of the same jth mode) and the\n\nwave spectrum (defined in Eq. (3.19)) by,\n\nSjj(?,?) = |Zj(?,?)|2S??(?,?) . (3.30)\n\nAmong the different qualitative characteristics of the RAOs, it is interesting to high-\n\nlight its main feature for the intermediate range of frequencies. As in the case of a\n\n\n\n45\n\nmechanical oscillator, the floating platform will experience a response of large amplitude\n\nclose and at the natural frequency of each one of its motions (also there is a phase shift\n\n? from zero, in lower frequencies, to ??, for ? = ?n). The resulting response, thus, will\n\nbe inversely proportional to the damping coefficient.\n\nAccordingly, the estimation of the RAOs is possible if the potential coefficient a and B\n\nare known. However, this estimation will not be accurate unless viscous damping effects\n\nare included. This is due to the fact that the model adopted until now assumes that the\n\nfluid is inviscid. Therefore, in those cases where the damping is dominated by viscous\n\neffects the theory will result in misleading (over)-estimation of the responses that the\n\nfloating system presents close to its motion resonances. A brief discussion regarding the\n\nviscous damping and its relevance for the motions of floating structures can be followed\n\nin the next section.\n\n3.3.1 Viscous damping effects\n\nReturning to the analogy of the mechanical oscillator, it is widely known that the\n\nresonant response will be inversely proportional to the damping coefficient. Hence, off-\n\nshore structures with small damping coefficients will experience large resonant responses.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it can be shown (by means of the Haskind relations8) that there is\n\na connection between the exciting force and the potential damping coefficient. Conse-\n\nquently, the vessels designed to experience small exciting forces will be subjected to small\n\ndamping coefficients, leading to large resonant responses. Clauss et al. (2014) show that\n\nthe semisubmersible platforms fall within this category and that their motions will be\n\ncharacterized by large resonant responses, whose damping is dominated by viscous effects\n\nmainly coming from the separation of the flow over the columns and pontoons.\n\nFollowing the approach proposed by Morison, Johnson and Schaaf (1950), the non-\n\nlinear drag force originated by viscous effects and the associated downstream wake can\n\nbe expressed as,\n\ndFd =\n1\n\n2\nCd? |u|udS . (3.31)\n\n8See (NEWMAN, 1977).\n\n\n\n46\n\nwhere u is the total local flow velocity, the Cd stands as the drag coefficient (including the\n\nform and friction drag) and S is the cross sectional area of the element of the structure\n\nunder study.\n\nNow, using Eqs. (3.9) and (3.31), it can be shown that the nonlinear drag force fulfils\n\nthe following relation,\n\ndFd ? |cos(? t)|cos(? t) . (3.32)\n\nAnd using series to develop the term |cos(? t)|cos(? t), the drag force can be rewritten\n\nas,\n\ndFd =\n??\nn=0\n\n(?1)n8 cos(2n + 1)? t\n?(2n + 1)[4 ? (2n + 1)2]\n\n1\n\n2\nCd?u\n\n2dS\n\n? [\n8\n\n3?\ncos(? t) +\n\n8\n\n15?\ncos(3? t)]\n\n1\n\n2\nCd?u\n\n2dS .\n\n(3.33)\n\nThis non-linear force can be linearized by means of the principle of energy equivalence:\n\nWhere the energy dissipation resulting from the drag force must be identical in both linear\n\nand nonlinear terms. More details regarding this linearization are provided in section 5.2.4.\n\nAs a direct consequence of this linearization, the estimated drag coefficient can be\n\nsuperposed to the radiation damping coefficient for a proper computation of the RAO\n\n(close to the motion resonance, where an over-estimation of the responses may occur).\n\nConcerning the resulting linearized damping coefficient (see Eq. (3.33)), it includes\n\nboth frictional and separation effects. However, it has been identified that the viscous\n\ndamping for offshore structures is mainly governed by the separation effects (SARPKAYA,\n\n2010). A common approach to categorize the relevance of the separation effects in periodic\n\nflows is the computation of the Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number. This coefficient is\n\nformally expressed as,\n\nKC =\nUT\n\nD\n, (3.34)\n\nwhere U is the equivalent amplitude of the object (or flow) velocity oscillation, T rep-\n\n\n\n47\n\nresents the period of the oscillation and D stands as a characteristic length scale of the\n\nobject (e.g. the diameter for a vertical cylinder under wave loading). Moreover, follow-\n\ning the linear wave theory for deep water conditions (see (NEWMAN, 1977)) U can be\n\nrewritten as U = A2? exp{ky}. Therefore, Eq. (3.34) can be expressed as,\n\nKC =\nh?\n\nD\nexp{ky} , (3.35)\n\nwhere h = 2A stands as the wave height.\n\nPhysically, the KC number can be related to the ratio of the maximum values of the\n\ndrag and inertia force acting on an element of the structure (see (CLAUSS et al., 2014))\n\nand it is crucial for determining the nature of the fluid force acting on the structure.\n\nTherefore, when the KC number is small the inertia forces are more important than\n\nthe drag forces, whereas if the KC number is large the drag forces are dominant. In\n\nsection 3.3.2 the KC number has been used to classify the nature of the forces acting on\n\nthe column elements of the hull of the semisubmersible platform adopted as a case study\n\nin this thesis.\n\nFinally, it must be highlighted that in this thesis the solution of the linear equations\n\nthat describe the motions of the vessel in waves has been computed by means of numerical\n\nmethods, which allow the estimations of the RAOs for arbitrary geometries. More pre-\n\ncisely, the RAOs adopted to estimate the sea conditions were computed by means of two\n\ndifferent software packages. First, WAMIT (LEE; NEWMAN, 2006) software was used\n\nto analyze the wave-body interaction in the frequency-domain. Secondly, ANSYS-AQWA\n\n(ANSYS, 2013) has also been used in this thesis. This package includes both frequency\n\nand time-domain analysis.\n\n3.3.2 Note on the motions of semisubmersible platforms in waves\n\nThe overview provided above constitutes a general description of the most significant\n\ndefinitions and theory adopted to characterize the induced ship motions in waves. Since\n\nthis thesis aims to assess the use of a semisubmersible platform as a motion based wave\n\nsensor, a discussion regarding the main characteristics of its hydrodynamic properties is\n\nprovided herein.\n\n\n\n48\n\nAt the beginning of section 3.3 it has been shown that the interaction of waves with\n\nfloating structures includes the effects that the vessel presence has on the incoming flow.\n\nThe significance of this effect is associated to the shape, dimensions and relative motion\n\nof the vessel that is being analyzed. In order to categorize the interaction wave-body,\n\ndistinction must be made between small and large bodies, since the nature of the forces\n\nexperienced by the vessel differs significatively depending on its size. In this case, the\n\nreader is referred once again to (CLAUSS et al., 2014) for a detailed discussion about this\n\ntopic.\n\nThe categorization of small/large bodies is based on the comparison between the\n\ncharacteristic length of the structure, D, the characteristic wave length, ?, and the wave\n\nheight, H (these parameters are generally evaluated for the most adverse conditions, i.e.\n\nat y = 0). Therefore, for small D/? and large values of H/D the structure can be\n\nassumed small. These conditions lead to a regime where viscous drag forces dominate\n\n(mainly originated by flow separation). For wave-body interactions where D/? are larger\n\nthan 0.2 and H/D is small, diffraction effects will dominate the dynamics of the structure\n\nand separation effects can be neglected.\n\nIn order to illustrate this categorization Fig. 3.7 is provided below, where the loading\n\nregimes for the columns of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform have been assessed\n\nin terms of the columns diameters, significant wave height and peak period for all the\n\nsea conditions tested during the experimental campaign9. In this figure the vertical axis\n\nshows the ratio H/D, which is equivalent to the KC number (CLAUSS et al., 2014) while\n\nthe horizontal axis can be interpreted as a the diffraction parameter.\n\nThe results in Fig. 3.7 show that the diffraction effects are more dominant for the\n\ncolumns with large diameters than for the columns with a diameter equal to 12.2m, as\n\nexpected. Moreover, for extreme wave conditions (high H/D relations) the data shows\n\nthat the drag effects become relevant, being the columns with smallest diameter the ones\n\nthat will experience larger drag forces. Meanwhile, in calm-mild sea conditions these hull\n\nelements will experience loading regimes featured by a dominance of the inertia terms.\n\nThis discussion regarding the main characteristics of the wave-body interaction pro-\n\n9Chapter 5 includes detailed descriptions of the main dimensions of the platform as well as the sea\nconditions tested.\n\n\n\n49\n\nD/6\n10-2 10-1 100\n\nH\n/D\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n100\n\n101 Columns ?=19.2m\nColumns ?=12.2m\n\nHydrodynamic\ncompact\n\nstructures\n\nF\nm\n\n : Inertia force\n\nF\nd\n  : Drag force\n\nF\nd\n/F\n\nm\n=0.5\n\nF\nd\n/F\n\nm\n=0.1\n\nF\nd\n/F\n\nm\n=0.01\n\nHydrodynamic\ntransparent\nstructures\n\nDiffraction &amp; ReflectionMorison equation (all intertia)\n\nDeep water wave breaking\n\n( H\n6\n\n= 1\n7\n)\n\nDrag force dominating\n\nMorison equation (large intertia)\n\nMorison equation (intertia &amp; drag)\n\nFigure 3.7: Loading regimes of horizontal forces acting on the columns of the A?sgard-B\nsemisubmersible platform in deepwater. Inspired from (CHAKRABARTI, 2005).\n\nvide a general idea of the dominant effects that column elements of the hull will experi-\n\nence. Notwithstanding this, the main characteristics of the platform dynamics are given\n\nby the motion RAOs. Thus, a brief review of the main feature of the motion RAOs for a\n\nsemisubmersible platform is provided hereafter.\n\nFirst, it is analyzed what happens to all the six degrees of motion in the high frequency\n\nrange. At very high frequencies, the exciting force in the numerator of Eq. (3.26) will\n\ntend to zero for all modes of motion (NEWMAN, 1977) while the denominator would be\n\nproportional to ?2. Thus, for short waves the RAOs of the six dofs will tend to zero.\n\nIn the long waves regime (that correspond to the limit of low frequencies), differently\n\nfrom the high frequency range, the platform motions are not expected to present the\n\nsame behavior. Regarding the roll and pitch motions, it can be show that the exciting\n\nforce will be characterized by small values, see (NEWMAN, 1977), while the denominator\n\nof Eq.(3.26) will be given by the respective restoring coefficients (which are different of\n\nzero). For the heave motion, it is expected that the structure will simply ride up and\n\ndown along with the free surface. In relation to the horizontal modes of the platform, the\n\nlarge diameter columns and massive displacements that the semisubmersible platforms\n\n\n\n50\n\npresent will result in a greater capability of the hull to disrupt the incoming waves. As a\n\nconsequence, the resulting forces may induce large amplitudes of motions of the platform\n\nin these dofs.\n\nFor the intermediate frequency range, it is already known that the main features of\n\nthe RAOs are the resonant responses of the motions. The resonant frequencies of the\n\nheave, roll and pitch motions are computed using the geometric features of the platform\n\n(CLAUSS et al., 2014). For instance, the distribution of the waterplane area of a semisub-\n\nmersible platform results in large resonant periods for these motions, when compared with\n\na ship-shaped platforms characterized with similar displacements. As a matter of fact,\n\nif compared with ship-shaped platforms, such as FPSOs, semisubmersible platforms are\n\ncharacterized by smaller waterplane areas, which result in low hydrostatic restoring coef-\n\nficients. Furthermore, layout of the waterplane area of a semisubmersible platform (given\n\nby the cross sectional area of the platform\u2019s columns) leads to large moments of inertia.\n\nAltogether, these characteristics result in large values for the resonance periods of heave,\n\nroll and pitch motions. For the sake of illustration, the natural periods for the heave,\n\nroll and pitch motion of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform are: 24s, 74s and 88s,\n\nrespectively10. That are significantly larger than the ones that characterize the dynamics\n\nof a FPSO, given for example in (BISPO et al., 2016), and that corresponds to 11.5s,\n\n14.5s and 16.3s, for the heave, roll and pitch motions respectively.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, an example of the heave motion RAO of the semisubmersible\n\nplatform used during the experimental campaign is shown in Fig. 3.8. This RAO has been\n\ncomputed in the frequency-domain using WAMIT for a heading condition equal to 180?,\n\nincluding the phase ?. From this figure, one may realize that this motion presents its reso-\n\nnance close to 24s. Also, in 22s the RAO has a cancellation point. For practical reasons, it\n\nis worth remembering that this cancellation point is the result of the equilibrium between\n\nthe forces acting on the pontoons of the platform and the forces acting on the columns11.\n\nAnalogous behavior is observed at lower wave periods, or higher frequencies, where the\n\nheave RAO shows some zero points. Nonetheless, in this case the origin of the zero points\n\nis due to the cancellation of the wave effects by the superposition of the forces on both\n\nsides of the semisubmersible. It is important to highlight that for some sea conditions the\n\n10The main characteristics of these motions are thoroughly discussed in chapter 5.\n11See appendix D for a comprehensive analysis of the heave RAO of the semisubmersible platform.\n\n\n\n51\n\nplatforms may present responses in frequencies that correspond to cancellation points of\n\nthe RAOs, where the platform is not expected to present any significant responses. This\n\ndeviation from the theoretical transfer function can be related, among other factors, to\n\nnon-linear drag effects; once again the reader is referred to appendix D for a detailed dis-\n\ncussion regarding the cancellation points of the heave RAO. Finally, the RAO shows that\n\nfor long waves the heave motion responds by following the surface elevation, meanwhile\n\nfor short waves the platform is expected to present motions with small amplitudes, as\n\nexpected.\n\nConcerning the phase of the RAO, ?, negative values mean that the positive maximum\n\nof forces or structural motions occurs after the passage of the wave crest. For instance,\n\nif ? = ?? we have that platform vertically oscillates opposite to the wave elevation.\n\nThe positives values for the phase stand for conditions where the positive maximum of\n\nforces happens before the passage of the wave crest. In long waves, the semisubmersible\n\npredictably follows the wave amplitude, and the resulting phase angle between heave\n\nmotion and wave elevation is zero.\n\nWith regard to the horizontal modes of the platform, their resonances would depend\n\non the restoring coefficients induced by the mooring system. Since the submerged lines\n\nresult in a system with low stiffness while the whole system is characterized by a large\n\nmass, the resulting resonances of these motions will happen in the very low frequency\n\nrange. It is important to highlight the fact that VMB wave inference aims at estimating\n\ngravity waves, whose periods usually range between 1 and 30s. Thus, the effects that may\n\narise close to the resonances of these motions (>> 30s) are not of interest for the purpose\n\nof this work.\n\nThe importance of the resonance frequency has its origin in the resulting amplitudes\n\nof motion. It has been shown that close and at the resonant frequency, the system\n\nwill present responses of large amplitudes. Furthermore, the semisubmersible platform\n\nis characterized by large resonance responses, in virtue of the connection between the\n\nexciting force and the damping coefficient as explained previously in section 3.3.1. As a\n\nmatter of fact, radiated waves are expected to be small due large draft of the platform\n\nand the cylindrical shape of the columns. Therefore, the platform will experience small\n\nexciting forces and, as a consequence, it will be subjected to small damping coefficients.\n\n\n\n52\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n H\n\ne\na\nve\n\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\nP\nh\n\na\nse\n\n A\n [\n\nra\nd\n\n]\n\n-:\n\n-0.5:\n\n0\n\n0.5:\n\n:\n\n180 deg.\n\nFigure 3.8: Heave motion RAO.\n\nIn order to illustrate the relevance of these viscous drag effects on the heave motion\n\nresponse, Fig. 3.9 provides the Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number estimated for the pon-\n\ntoons of the platform, based on the measured responses close to the resonance of the\n\nmotion.

Similar results are\n\npresented by Chaplin (1988), who analyzed the flow around a submerged circular cylinder\n\nin beam waves. Moreover, the author shown that since the drag forces arise mainly from\n\nseparations effects, there are not any severe scale effects (a detailed discussion regarding\n\nthe scale effects is also provided in (FALTINSEN, 1993)), thus increasing the reliability\n\nof the model-scale results.\n\n\n\n54\n\n3.4 The semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave\n\nsensor\n\nThis section aims at providing an earlier assessment of the possible advantages and\n\ndisadvantages that the adoption of the semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor\n\nmay present. This evaluation is entirely based on the main weaknesses and strengths\n\nrelated to the methodology described in section 3.3. Although the following discussion\n\nis focused on the dynamics of the semisubmersible platform, the reader is referred to\n\nchapter 4 and appendix B for a discussion concerning the main limitations of the theory\n\nprovided in section 3.2 and its possible implications for the VMB wave inference problem.\n\nThe main objective of this thesis is the assessment of the use of the semisubmersible\n\nplatform as a motion based wave sensor. Nonetheless, other ship-shaped vessels, such\n\nas FPSOs and container ships, have been adopted as reliable wave sensors in a wide\n\nrange of sea conditions. Therefore, for illustrative purposes the main features of the\n\nsemisubmersible platform have been compared with the ones of the FPSOs, which are\n\nbroadly documented in the literature, e.g. (BISPO, 2011b).\n\nThe RAOs of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform are provided in Fig. 3.10. This\n\nfigure includes the RAOs corresponding to: surge, sway, heave, roll and pitch motions12,\n\nwhich have been computed for 5 different headings. In a similar way, and only for com-\n\nparative purposes, Fig. 3.10 provides the RAOs of a FPSO.\n\nConcerning the RAOs of the semisubmersible platform, one may realize that in the\n\nfirst region up to the zero point at T = 10s in the horizontal motions, the transfer functions\n\nof motion indicate small oscillation amplitudes. As a consequence, unlike the ship-shaped\n\nplatforms (see Fig. 3.11), the semisubmersible is expected to filter large amounts of energy\n\nfor the most frequently encountered wave periods in offshore activities (T &lt;10s). For\n\ninstance, the heave motion will be less than 10% of wave elevation. These characteristics\n\nof the semisubmersible motions in the high frequency range properly illustrate the main\n\npossible drawback of the VMB wave inference, highlighted previously in section 1.1.2,\n\nwhich may result in inaccurate estimations of calm sea conditions.\n\n12The yaw motion has not been included in this analysis due to the fact that its main properties\ndepend on external factors, such as mooring stiffness and inertia properties of the platform around the z\n(vertical)-axis; about which there was not accurate/enough data in order to carry out a proper analysis\nand characterization.\n\n\n\n55\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\nSurge RAO\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\nSway RAO\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\nHeave RAO\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nra\n\nd\n/m\n\n]\n\n#10-3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\nRoll RAO\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nra\n\nd\n/m\n\n]\n\n#10-3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\nPitch RAO\n\n180 deg.\n150 deg.\n135 deg.\n120 deg.\n90 deg.\n\nFigure 3.10: RAOs of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform.

For in-\n\nstance, the small amplitudes that the semisubmersible platforms present in calm to mild\n\nsea conditions have led some authors to assume (a priori ) that these platforms are not\n\nreliable motion based wave sensors, as it has been discussed in section 1.1.2. However,\n\none may realize that although the RAOs are not characterized by large responses, there\n\nare no resonance or cancellation points in this interval in any of the five dofs under study.\n\n\n\n56\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\nSurge RAO\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\nSway RAO\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\nHeave RAO\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nra\n\nd\n/m\n\n]\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.07\n\n0.08\n\n0.09\nRoll RAO\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nra\n\nd\n/m\n\n]\n\n0\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.01\n\n0.012\nPitch RAO\n\n180 deg.\n150 deg.\n135 deg.\n120 deg.\n90 deg.\n\nFigure 3.11: RAOs of a FPSO. From left-to-right then top-to-bottom: surge, sway, heave,\nroll and pitch. Data from (BISPO, 2011b).\n\nTherefore, the reliability of the linear relation between the exciting waves and the plat-\n\nform responses is hold. Concerning the RAOs of the FPSO, they not only show several\n\nzero points but also the heave, roll and pitch motions present their resonances within the\n\nlimits of this period range. Thus, the associated non-linear effects are expected to result\n\nin the increase of the uncertainty of the estimations of the sea conditions based on the\n\nmeasured motions of a FPSO (BISPO, 2011b).\n\n\n\n57\n\nFor the highest possible waves to which the extreme wave conditions belongs, periods\n\nlie in the region of T > 20s. The RAOs have been computed following the approach\n\ndescribed in section 3.3, where the small wave amplitudes/slopes are assumed. However,\n\nit is not clear if this assumption is consistent for the period range evaluated: Although\n\nfor the most general sea conditions the wave amplitude/slope can be assumed sufficiently\n\nsmall (see Fig. 3.7), in extreme sea conditions with very step wind waves this assumption it\n\nmay not be fulfilled leading to uncertainties of the RAOs. The most significant features of\n\nthe semisubmersible RAOs in this range are identified for the heave motion, that presents\n\na cancellation point and its resonance.\n\nRegarding the dynamic behavior of the heave resonance, it is already known that the\n\nsemisubmersible platforms are expected to present large responses, due to the small po-\n\ntential damping that the hull presents. This may result in the violation of the assumption\n\nof small response amplitudes. Moreover, non-linear viscous forces become significant in\n\nthe heave motion near the resonance, modifying the linearly estimated responses as well\n\nas the cancellation point close to the resonance (here the reader is referred, once again,\n\nto appendix D for a detailed discussion regarding the resonance and this zero point). In\n\nthis case, an external damping coefficient must be imposed in order to emulate the effects\n\nof the viscous forces. However, it is not obvious how to bound the influence of these\n\nviscous effects a priori (a detailed evaluation of the cancellation point and the assessment\n\nof various solutions proposed to account for the associated shortcomings is provided in\n\nchapter 5). Therefore, in harsh weather conditions the heave responses must be properly\n\nmodelled in order to avoid misleading estimation of the sea conditions that induced the\n\nmeasured motions of the platform. Regarding the extremely low-frequency components,\n\nit can be highlighted that the platform is expected to follow the free surface elevation,\n\nreaching, in the limit, a pure heave motion.\n\nFinally, another characteristic of the semisubmersible platforms is their reduced value\n\nof the metacentric height (GM)13, which limits its stability properties. As a consequence,\n\nthese platforms constantly monitor their GM values. Moreover, usually these platforms\n\nare typically designed only for three different draft configurations which are: the opera-\n\ntional, survival and transit draft. In the operating condition the draft is at the maximum\n\n13The metacentric height stands as a measurement of the initial static stability of a floating body. A\ndetailed analysis of this parameter is found in (LEWIS, 1988)\n\n\n\n58\n\nmagnitude. These features turn to be an advantage for the semisubmersible platforms as\n\nmotion based wave sensor, since they allow the estimation of the most appropriate set\n\nof RAOs at any moment. Contrary, the FPSOs present large draft variations that result\n\nin significant changes of their stability properties, such as their GM and centre of grav-\n\nity. This limitation is well illustrated in (BISPO, 2011b), where the author carried out a\n\nsensibility study to assess the RAOs changes of a FPSO in differing loading conditions.\n\n\n\n59\n\n4 BAYESIAN INFERENCE\n\n4.1 The Bayesian paradigm\n\nPrevious works and results concerning VMB wave inference, e.g. (ISEKI; OHTSU,\n\n2000) and (NIELSEN, 2006), as well as the preceding research conducted at the USP on\n\nthis topic, i.e. (TANNURI et al., 2003; SIMOS et al., 2012), have motivated the adoption\n\nof the Bayesian inference method to estimate the sea conditions based on the measured\n\nplatform motions. A proper explanation with regards to the advantages of using this\n\nstatistical inference method to estimate the sea conditions from the measured platform\n\nmotions is addressed along the next sections.\n\nBayesian inference is one of the most important statistical inference methods in use\n\nnowadays. Its core principle is that the posterior distribution of the variable of interest is\n\nthe result of updating the existing prior information on the model parameters using the\n\navailable data, where the systematic process of learning from the data is implemented via\n\nBayes theorem. This can be formally expressed as follows (BERNARDO; SMITH, 2006),\n\nP(x|B) =\nP(B|x)p(x)\n\nP(B)\n, (4.1)\n\nwhere P(x|B) is the posterior updated distribution, P(B|x) is the probability of observing\n\nB given x, p(x) is the prior distribution and P(B) stands for the marginal probability\n\ndistribution of observing the event B.\n\nSince the proportionality constant, P(B) =\n?\n?\nP(B|x)p(x)dx, may always be de-\n\nducted from the fact that P(x|B), a probability density function, may be integrated to\n\none, the Bayes theorem may be simply expressed as follows,\n\n\n\n60\n\nP(x|B) ? P(B|x)p(x) . (4.2)\n\n4.2 Bayesian modelling procedure and ill-conditioned\n\nproblems\n\nFrom a formal Bayesian point of view, it is assumed that the statistical model derived\n\nfrom the observed data, P(B|x), is correct. In fact the Bayesian learning process is\n\noptimal when P(B|x) matches the exact statistical distribution of the observed data\n\n(ZELLNER, 1988). Returning to the VMB wave inference problem, the model can be\n\nwritten in accordance with the RAOs of the vessel. Thus, the output of the Bayesian\n\ninference procedure will be optimum for those cases where the RAOs stand as the true\n\n(exact) statistic that determine the likely behavior of the vessel when operated at sea.\n\nHowever, in practice, it is already known that only in controlled conditions and for a\n\nlimited range of frequencies and directions the RAOs will lead to the exact statistical\n\nmodel. For instance, in several engineering problems both the exact statistical model\n\nparameters and their number (order) are generally unknown, and oftentimes the exact\n\nmodel is infinite-dimensional (then, non-parametric). Therefore, to attain something\n\nclose to a exact model, one would need a very large statistical model, yet this is at the\n\nexpense of keeping the statistical model as simple as possible in order to focus on the\n\nmain characteristics of the system under study.\n\nOne of the first works dealing with this challenge was the problem addressed by\n\nWhittaker (1922) in the estimation of a smooth trend. In that problem, the observations,\n\nB, are given. They are assumed to consist of the sum of a smooth function, f, and the\n\nobservation Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance ?2. The problem is to estimate\n\nthe unknown trend function, f. In this context, Whittaker (1922) suggested that the\n\noptimal solution will balance a tradeoff between the fitting of data and the goodness-of-fit\n\nto a smoothness criterion. This idea is considered a conceptual predecessor of smoothness\n\npriors in Bayesian inference.\n\nConsequently, a common approach is to model the phenomenon under investigation\n\nmaking use of a stochastic linear regression model, which allows the study of the essential\n\nfeatures of the unknown physical process.\n\n\n\n61\n\nConsider the Gaussian stochastic linear regression model,\n\nB = A x + ? , (4.3)\n\nwhere B stands for the measurements, A is the matrix that contains the characteristics of\n\nthe sensor, x is the unknown vector and ? is the sensor noise with zero mean and variance\n\n?2. The dimensions of the matrices in Eq. (4.3) are B : n\u00d7 1; A : n\u00d7 p; x : p\u00d7 1 and\n\n? : n\u00d7 1, where n is the number of measurements and p is the dimension of the unknown\n\nvector x.\n\nA straightforward approach to reconstruct the unknown would be the use of the\n\ninverse transform with the inverse filter, which is possible by using the pseudoinverse\n\n(A+) of matrix A. Thus,\n\nx? = A+B = x + A+? . (4.4)\n\nHowever, the noise may make this approximation impossible. As a mater of fact, in\n\nsolving the inverse-problem, the pseudoinverse A+ operates as a high-pass filter that has\n\nthe undesirable tendency to amplify noise. This means that the estimation of the unknown\n\nquickly becomes unstable as many noisy values are multiplied by larger values and then\n\nsummed up. In those cases, the pseudoinverse is said to be ill-conditioned. Otherwise, the\n\nproblem is known to be well-conditioned or well-posed1, leading to a significant variation\n\nof the output value of the problem for a small change in the input argument.\n\nThe standard approach to solve the problem introduced by Eq. (4.3) is the use of\n\nthe linear least square regression method finding the minimum of J(x) = ||Ax ? B||2.\n\nHowever, if the problem is ill-conditioned, the ordinary least square estimation leads to\n\nan under-determined or, more often, to an over-determined (over-fitted) model2. In order\n\n1In accordance with Hadamard (2014), a well-conditioned problem should have the following proper-\nties: (i) a solution exists; (ii) the solution is unique; (iii) the solution\u2019s behavior changes continuously\nwith the initial conditions. A simple illustrative example of an ill-conditioned matrix is given by the\nfollowing matrix,\n\nA =\n1\n\n2\n\n[\n1 1\n\n1 + 10?10 1 ? 10?10\n]\n, with A+ =\n\n[\n1 ? 1010 1010\n1 + 1010 ?1010\n\n]\n.\n\nWhich will result in the amplification of the measurement noise (when it exists). It is important to\nhighlight that this matrix is characterized by a very small determinant (2 \u00b7 10?10).\n\n2The reader must note that the nature of the problem is also conditioned by the number of unknowns\n\n\n\n62\n\nto give preference to a particular solution with desirable properties, a regularization term\n\ncan be included in this minimization,\n\nJ(x) = ||Ax ? B||2 + ?||Dx||2 , (4.5)\n\nwhere ? is referred to as a hyperparameter (LINDLEY; SMITH, 1972), and stands as a\n\ntrade-off parameter, balancing the variability of the estimation of the unknown and the\n\nregularization condition. A small hyperparameter will prioritize a rough estimation and,\n\nas a consequence, the data totally determine the estimation. As the hyperparameter gets\n\nlarger, the estimate moves further from the rough estimation and the regularization con-\n\nditions become more influential. Concerning matrix D, it stands as the matrix containing\n\nthe different weights given to regularization and it is usually known. This equation is\n\nthe more general form of the regularized objective function also known as the weighted\n\nregularization (KITAGAWA; GERSCH, 2012).\n\nAccordingly, if ? were known and since the measurement noise is assumed Gaussian,\n\nthe unbiased solution of the problem is given by the minimization of the regularized\n\nobjective function, Eq. (4.5). Thus, taking the gradient with respect to x,\n\n?J(x) = 2AT (Ax ? B) + 2? DT Dx , (4.6)\n\nand setting this gradient to zero, the unbiased solution is given by,\n\nx? = (AT A + ? DT D)?1AT B . (4.7)\n\nAiming at illustrate the weighted regularization, Fig. 4.1 has been included as an\n\nexample. This figure provides the exact function (black line) that must be fitted and it is\n\ngiven by y(x) = 1.5 x. Moreover, 17 points (black points), sampled from the exact function\n\n(y), are included. In order to obtain these 17 noisy samples accordingly with Eq. (4.3),\n\nthe following relation has been adopted: y + ?, where ? is a Gaussian measurement noise\n\nwith zero mean and variance equal to 1. In addition to these samples and the real function\n\n(y), approximations obtained by means of a polynomial model of order four are displayed.\n\nthat have to be solve. Thus, if n &lt;p (in addition to the fact that the pseudoinverse of matrix A may act\nas a high pass filter) then the adoption of ordinary multivariate procedures to estimate the unknowns is\nnot longer possible.\n\n\n\n63\n\nx\n1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2\n\ny\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\nExact Funtion\nSamples\nUnderfitting\nOverfitting\nModel\n\nFigure 4.1: Illustration of the weighted regularization problem.\n\nIn this case, and with illustrative purposes, a weighted regularization has been adopted\n\nto compute the fourth order fitting model. Therefore, the coefficients of the fourth order\n\npolynomial models are computed by means of Eq. (4.7). Concerning the matrix containing\n\nthe different weights, D, the following form has been adopted,\n\nD =\n\n?\n??????????\n\n1 ?2 1 0 0\n\n0 1 ?2 1 0\n\n0 0 1 ?2 1\n\n0 0 0 0.1 0.1\n\n1 0 0 0 0.1\n\n?\n??????????\n, (4.8)\n\nThis matrix results in a regularization problem that prioritizes smooth solutions (the\n\nreader is referred to section 4.4 and (KITAGAWA; GERSCH, 2012) for a detailed discus-\n\nsion concerning the main characteristics of matrix D provided). The hyperparameter, ?,\n\nassessed for this illustrating example varies between 0 and 1000 (this stands as a set of\n\nvalues that, similarly to matrix D, has been selected ad-hoc).\n\nThe solutions obtained in this example highlighted the critical role of the hyperpa-\n\n\n\n64\n\nrameter. First, an estimation of the training data has been obtained using ? = 1000\n\nand it is not sufficient to fit the training samples. This is called underfitting (green line).\n\nSecondly, the value of ? has been set equal to 0, which results in a polynomial model\n\n(red line) that over-fits the sampled points, i.e. it learns the noise of the training data.\n\nFinally, the best fitting model is included (blue line) and it corresponds to ? = 30. This\n\nmodel minimizes the norm of the differences between the coefficients of the fourth degree\n\npolynomial model obtained through the exact function, y = 1.5 x, and the fourth degree\n\npolynomial model, y?, computed using the weighted regularization with ? = 30. Table 4.1\n\nshows the error values for the three values of ? aforementioned.\n\nTable 4.1: Hyperparameter values and the corresponding estimated error.\n\n? ||x? ? x||2\n0 581.3\n30 0.89\n\n1000 1.86\n\nAs a matter of fact, ? = 30 is a good choice for the regularization parameter. Thus,\n\nresulting in a 4th order polynomial fitting model given by: y?(x) = ?0.038x4 + 0.12x3 +\n\n0.27x2 + 0.43x+ 0.58. However, it must be reminded that we could only compute Tab. 4.1\n\nwith the knowledge of the exact solution, y = 1.5 x.\n\nReturning to the review of the theoretical framework, an interpretation of the Bayesian\n\nsmoothness priors is obtained by multiplying Eq. (4.5) by ?1\n2?2\n\nand exponentiate (KON-\n\nISHI; KITAGAWA, 1996). Thus, the unknown that minimizes Eq. (4.5) also maximizes\n\nthe following relation,\n\nexp\n\n(\n?1\n2?2\n||Ax ? B||2\n\n)\nexp\n\n(\n??\n2?2\n||Dx||2\n\n)\n, (4.9)\n\nwhere ?2 remains as the variance of the sensor noise.\n\nFrom Eq. (4.9), the unbiased solution (since the resulting posterior distribution is\n\nassumed Gaussian) is the unknown that maximizes the product of the conditional data\n\ndistribution3 (the first term of Eq. (4.9)) and the prior distribution (the second term of\n\nEq. (4.9)). The main advantage of adopting the Bayesian modelling approach arises from\n\n3Akaike (1992) introduces the notion that the statistical model may be regarded as depending of the\nunknown, then it can be called the likelihood function.\n\n\n\n65\n\nthe fact that the value of the hyperparameter can be obtained following the approach\n\nproposed in (AKAIKE, 1980). From Shibata (1983) and Akaike (1980), it can be shown\n\nthat when using a finite-dimensional stochastic Gaussian regression model to estimate the\n\nassumed infinite-dimensional truth model with a conjugated prior distribution, the ABIC\n\n(Akaike\u2019s Bayesian Information Criterion) provides an asymptotically efficient solution\n\nunder the quadratic loss function for selecting the best fit to the data.\n\nThus, the Bayes theorem (see Eq. (4.2)) is obtained from combining Eq. (4.9) and\n\nEq. (4.3),\n\nP(x|B,?2,?) ? P(B|x,?2)p(x|?2, D,?) , (4.10)\n\nSince the left hand side of Eq. (4.10) is a proper distribution, the marginal likelihood\n\nof the unknown parameters (? and ?2) is given by the integration of the right hand side\n\nof the equation,\n\nL(?,?2) =\n\n? ?\nP(B|x,?2)p(x|?2, D,?)dxdD . (4.11)\n\nGood (2003) referred to the maximization of Eq. (4.11) as a type II maximum likeli-\n\nhood method (which includes certain hypotheses concerning the distribution of the data\n\nand the use of the proper conjugate prior distribution). An essential result in Akaike\n\n(1980) is that, since the posterior distribution is normally distributed, then the marginal\n\nlikelihood of the unknown parameters can be expressed in a closed form, providing a\n\nmethod for the direct computation of the value of the hyperparameter.\n\nA common approach in information criteria and statistical modelling is the use of the\n\nKullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence) to measure how the estimated probability\n\ndistribution diverges from the expected probability distribution. This index is similar to\n\nthe Fisher information distance (see Walker (2016)) and relies on the expected differential\n\nentropy between prior and posterior distributions. In fact, the KL-Divergence can be used\n\nto show that the value of the hyperparameter, ?, estimated with the ABIC minimizes the\n\nnorm of the difference between the entropy4 of the prior and the posterior distributions.\n\n4The entropy of a system is defined as the minimal amount of information needed to describe its state\n(AKAIKE, 1992).\n\n\n\n66\n\nThis means that the prior distribution obtained using the ABIC is the least informative\n\nas well as the one that presents smaller differences with the posterior distribution.\n\n4.3 Data distributions\n\nThe concepts and hypotheses presented in the previous sections provide a general idea\n\nregarding the data distribution. However, a detailed analysis is needed to fully understand\n\nthe repercussion of these assumptions on the output of the inference problem. A brief\n\nreview of the two main assumptions and their implications is provided herein, so that the\n\nreader can asses the adequacy of these assumptions to the real phenomenon when it is\n\nanalyzed later in this section:\n\n\u2022 Measurement noise is Gaussian: The assumption that the measurement noise is\n\nGaussian is the strongest condition regarding the structure and output of the prob-\n\nlem. However, it is also a weak hypothesis as we will see later. Since the difference\n\nbetween the measurements and the estimations is assumed Gaussian with variance,\n\n?2, and zero mean, this hypothesis leads to a Gaussian Likelihood function of the\n\ndata model with similar properties.\n\n\u2022 Gaussianity of the posterior distribution and conjugate prior distribution: In order\n\nto ensure that the posterior distribution is Gaussian, the prior distribution is chosen\n\nto be Gaussian (the Gaussian family is conjugate to itself, or self-conjugate, with\n\nrespect to a Gaussian likelihood function). The fact that the posterior distribution\n\nis Gaussian provides a key advantage, because it ensures that the ABIC provides\n\nthe optimal values for the hyperparameters (KONISHI; KITAGAWA, 1996).\n\nIt is widely known, see for example (HAVER; MOAN, 1983), (NIELSEN, 2005) or\n\n(FALTINSEN, 1993), that the hypotheses above can be largely affected by the uncer-\n\ntainties related to the stochastic modelling of the ocean waves and the linear wave-body\n\ninteraction modelling adopted to describe the motions of the platform. Concerning the\n\nwave-body interaction modelling procedure, chapter 3 addressed its main characteristics\n\nalong with the possible shortcomings. Also, it provided a brief description of the stochastic\n\nmodelling of ocean waves, whose possible drawbacks will be discussed next.\n\n\n\n67\n\nBasic assumptions commonly adopted for the probabilistic description of ocean waves\n\nare: Records (time series) of the process shall be stationary and ergodic in order to esti-\n\nmate meaningful statistical properties from only one realization of the irregular sea. Also,\n\nthe surface elevation random process is assumed to be Gaussian. These two assumptions\n\nare only partially fulfilled in actual sea states. However, they are widely used since they\n\nimply very attractive simplifications from a practical point of view.\n\nIn addition to these assumptions, uncertainties will be always related to the selection of\n\nsignificant values to represent the sea condition, as for any stochastic phenomenon. These\n\nuncertainties should be recognized in the actual learning process since they are somehow\n\nincluded in the measurement noise of the model. For this purpose, following (HAVER;\n\nMOAN, 1983) and (BENKE; LOWELL; HAMILTON, 2008), a brief but comprehensive\n\ndescription is provided.\n\nFundamental uncertainty\n\nThis uncertainty is consequence of making use of stochastic models to characterize\n\nthe phenomenon in study. Therefore, this uncertainty is inherent to the random nature\n\nof the phenomenon.\n\nModel uncertainty\n\nThis uncertainty can be decomposed into two different components: First, as it has\n\nbeen pointed out before, the real nature phenomenon can never be strictly modelled.\n\nThis means that the analytic model of a physical phenomenon implies simplifications,\n\ni.e. an approximated image of the real stochastic phenomenon is considered. Secondly,\n\nan uncertainty can be introduced through the selection of the probability distribution\n\nfor the random variables involved in the phenomenon due to lack of knowledge (if the\n\ndistribution is known a priori only a reduced model uncertainty is introduced due to the\n\nmodel simplification). If the distribution of the random variable is not known, it is hard\n\nto exactly quantify the model uncertainty associated to a specific choice of a probability\n\ndistribution.\n\nOne may realize that this uncertainty is always present and it is implicit to the\n\nmathematical model of the physical phenomenon.\n\n\n\n68\n\nParameter uncertainty\n\n(HECKMAN; MEYERS, 1983) is one of the first works that began the analysis of\n\nparameter uncertainty. Since the estimation of the parameters has to be done from\n\nexisting data, there is an uncertainty associated to the estimated variables (subjected to\n\nboth bias, systematic and, also, random error).\n\nThese three uncertainties together with the ones related to the misleading estimations\n\nof the RAOs (due to effects discussed in section 3.3) are supposed to be embedded in the\n\nmeasurement noise. As a consequence, one may realize that the assumptions concerning\n\nthe data distribution of the Bayesian approach adopted may be inaccurate, especially\n\nwhen it comes to the measurement noise. The problem is therefore: Is the measurement\n\nnoise Gaussian distributed? And if not, what are the implications?\n\nFor some sea conditions, specially the more severe sea states, previous studies (HAVER;\n\nMOAN, 1983) indicate that sometimes the stationarity assumption can be questioned even\n\nfor short periods of time (less than 30 min). In practice, it is typically assumed that the\n\nstationary period holds to few hours (SOARES; FRICKE, 2011). Furthermore, it is widely\n\naccepted that a non-Gaussian structure of the sea surface elevation is likely to occur when\n\nthe wave steepness increases.\n\nIn section 3.4 it has been shown that the hypothesis of linear dynamic model for the\n\nvessel motions can be questioned for more severe sea states, due to the relatively large\n\nsteepness of the waves and the possible excitation of resonant motions of the platform,\n\nboth of which would result in non-Gaussian measurement errors of the stochastic linear\n\nregression model adopted. For moderate to mild sea conditions, the RAOs computed in\n\nthe frequency-domain are expected to provide accurate estimations of the motions of the\n\nplatform, when combined with the sea spectrum.\n\nIn summary, the Gaussianity assumption can be strongly questioned in connection\n\nwith rough sea states. Therefore, assuming that we have the motion records for a time\n\nspan for which the sea condition can be assumed stationary, what are the possible effects\n\non the estimation of the sea state using the Bayesian if the Gaussianity assumption is not\n\nmet or can be questioned?\n\n\n\n69\n\nFor answering this, let us assume that we obtain a certain estimation of the sea\n\ncondition, namely x?. Due to the nature of this problem, if the estimator is unbiased, the\n\nquadratic loss function has to be minimized as follows,\n\nmin{E\n[\n(x ? x?)2\n\n]\n} = min{E\n\n[\n(x2 ? 2xx? + x?2\n\n]\n} , (4.12)\n\nwhere E [\u00b7] stands for the expected value. Thus, taking the gradient with respect to x,\n\n?(E\n[\n(x ? x?)2\n\n]\n) = 2E [x] ? 2E [x?] , (4.13)\n\nand setting the gradient equal to zero, the unbiased solution is given by5,\n\n5The reader may have already realized the fact that the main limitation that Eq. (4.14) brings is\nthat it is high-dimensional. For instance, the solution of the problem as it is given in Eq. (4.14) can be\ncomputed as follows,\n\nE[x|B] =\n?\nx??\n\nx\nP(x|B)p(x)\n\nP(B)\ndx ,\n\nwhere ? stands as the space that contains all the possible sea states. Although this space is finite\ndimensional, its dimensions remain sufficiently large to make the computation of the expected value of\nx, given certain motion measurements B, unfeasible from a conventional point of view. Nevertheless,\nthere are some approaches that may allow the estimation of the value of this integral, i.e. the expected\nvalue of the sea state based on the measured motions, such as the Monte Carlo method for solving\nhigh-dimensional integrals (see (SOBOL, 1994)).\n\nBasically, this approach allows the approximation of the integral of any function, let us say for the time\n\nbeing g(x), as the mean value of the ratio\ng(x)\nh(x)\n\n. Thus,\n\nI =\n\n? b\na\n\ng(x)dx =\n\n? b\na\n\ng(x)\n\nh(x)\nh(x)dx ? E\n\n[\ng(x)\n\nh(x)\n\n]\n,\n\nwhere h(x) is any arbitrary probability density function that is defined over the domain of integration,\ne.g. 1/(b?a). Accordingly, the value of the integral can be approximated as,\n\nI ?\nb?a\nN\n\nN?\ni=1\n\ng(xi) .\n\nThis integration method can be generalized to compute multidimensional integrals, such as,\n\nI =\n\n?\nx??\n\ng(x)dx,\n\nThus,\n\nI =\n\n?\nx??\n\ng(x)\n\nh(x)\nh(x)dx ? I =\n\n1\n\nN\n\nN?\ni=1\n\ng(x)\n\nh(x)\n.\n\nTherefore this method involves the estimation of the values of g (in our case\nxP(x|B)p(x)\n\nP(B)\n) at a number\n\nN of points, which can be selected randomly in the domain of integration (the result becomes exact when\nN ? ?, being the error proportional to 1?\n\nN\n(SOBOL, 1994)). In order to compute the values of this\n\nfunctional a straightforward approach would be the use of the metocean data. Thus for each possible sea\nstate, x, shown by this set of data, it is possible to compute the probability of existence, p(x), by taking\nthe ratio between the number of observed events (x) over the possible number of sea states (in this cases\n\n\n\n70\n\nx? = E [x] . (4.14)\n\nIt is worth remembering that the sea estimation obtained from the Bayesian inference\n\nmethod proposed above is the sea condition that maximizes the posterior distribution.\n\nTherefore, if the posterior distribution is Gaussian, i.e. the measurement noise is Gaus-\n\nsian, the expected value is equal to the Mode of the distribution and, as a consequence of\n\nEq. (4.14), the estimation is unbiased. However, if the measurement noise is not Gaussian,\n\neven though the optimal value of the hyperparameter is known somehow, the solution ob-\n\ntained by the maximization of the product of the prior distribution and likelihood function\n\nis expected to be biased. Furthermore, in this condition the values of the hyperparameters\n\nestimated by means of the ABIC approach may not be optimal (ISEKI, 2012).\n\nThe resulting bias associated to the estimation in cases when there is a lack of Gaus-\n\nsianity can hardly be quantified in advance. A common procedure adopted in order to\n\novercome this drawback is the use of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) pro-\n\ncedure, which is equivalent to the use of the Laplace distribution as a prior distribution\n\n(KITAGAWA; GERSCH, 2012). The output of this approach, that minimizes the L1\n\nnorm, is less sensitive to the dispersion of the posterior probability distribution of the\n\nvariable of interest. Although (in theory) this approach is optimal, it does not provide a\n\nproper methodology to choose the optimal values of the hyperparameters.\n\nReturning to the VMB wave inference approach, the results obtained in previous\n\nworks, such as in (HIRAYAMA, 1987), show that the adoption of the use of the MLE\n\nprocedure has some limitations regarding the estimation of wave frequency and direction.\n\nOtherwise, there are several works that assume that the measurement noise is Gaussian,\n\ne.g. (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000; TANNURI et al., 2003; NIELSEN, 2008; SIMOS et al.,\n\np(x) would be given by the total number of sea states assessed in the metocean report). It is important\nto highlight that h(x) can be estimated following the same approach, thus h(x) = p(x). Regarding the\nlikelihood function, P(x|B), it can be computed following (AKAIKE, 1980) (see Eq. (4.22)). Finally, the\nterm P(B) can be easily computed as\n\n?N\ni=1 P(xi|B)p(xi).\n\nUnfortunately, this process cannot be adopted for the general purpose of this thesis. This is mainly\ndue to the fact that it relies on the availability of previous metocean data of the sea being monitored. Its\nmain limitation, thus, not only entails the availability of previous metocean data of the field where the\ncampaign is carried out, but also it must be sufficiently representative in order to include a wide range\nof possible events, i.e. metocean data based on short field measurement campaigns may not include\ninfrequent sea states. Finally, although this methodology stands as a fast procedure for surveying the sea\nstate based on the ship motions, its research and application have been left as a future work.\n\n\n\n71\n\n2012) and (BISPO et al., 2016). Even though problems may become relevant in some\n\nsea condition, such as when part of the high frequency components of the sea spectrum\n\nare filtered by the ship (BISPO, 2011b), these works have attested that good estimations\n\nof the sea conditions can be obtained, both in model and full-scale applications. Conse-\n\nquently, from now on, the hypothesis of the Gaussian property for the measurement noise\n\nwill be accepted for the semisubmersible platform, although sometimes at the expense\n\nof the optimal solution. Moreover, the improvements made on the RAOs regarding the\n\nnon-linear effects, discussed later in chapter 5, should favor the validity of the Gaussianity\n\nhypothesis. Finally, it should be stressed that the Gaussianity hypothesis of the measure-\n\nment noise can be considered almost unavoidable (CLAUSS et al., 2014) due to practical\n\nreasons related to numerical and/or experimental limitations when it comes to deal with\n\nthe wave-body interaction problem.\n\nUnder this Gaussianity hypothesis, the likelihood function can be written as it is\n\nshown next. Also, the formal description of the problem provided ahead is expected to\n\nhelp the reader to fully understand the computation procedure of the Bayesian inference\n\napproach, as it is adopted in the present work.\n\nAssuming that the relation between the waves and the platform responses is linear,\n\nthe directional wave spectrum, S??(?,?), and the vessel RAOs are related to the cross\n\nspectra derived from the time series of the platform motions (Sij) through the following\n\nidentity (see section 3.3),\n\nSij(?) =\n\n? ?\n??\n\nZi(?,?)Z\n?\nj(?,?)S??(?,?)d? , (4.15)\n\nwhere Zi(?,?) is the Response Amplitude Operator of the motion i at wave frequency ?\n\nand direction of incidence ?. Z?j(?,?) stands for the complex conjugate of the RAO. The\n\nrelation given in Eq. (4.15) can be rewritten in discrete form assuming the integrand to\n\nbe constant in each slice ?? = 2?\nK\n\n, leading to,\n\nSij(?) = ??\nK?\nk=1\n\nZi(?,?k)Z\n?\nj(?,?k)S??(?,?k) , (4.16)\n\nwhere ?k = ?? + (k? 1)?? and K is the number of discrete wave directions considered.\n\nReturning to the indices i and j, they correspond to the dofs assessed; i.e. if only three\n\n\n\n72\n\ndofs are adopted (N=3): heave, roll and pitch; these indices will vary between 3 and 5.\n\nIf a certain range of M wave frequencies is specified previously, being ?? = ?M??1\nM?1 ,\n\nEq. (4.16) can be approximated in matrix form as follows,\n\nB = A x + ? , (4.17)\n\nHere, the vector B contains a total of (N2 \u00b7 M\u00d7 1) elements, which are related to the\n\nspectra, Sii, and the cross-spectra, Sij, of the measured motions, and can be expressed\n\nas,\n\nB =\n\n?\n??????????\n\nb1\n...\n\nbm\n...\n\nbM\n\n?\n??????????\n, with bm =\n\n?\n?????????????\n\nSii(?m)\n...\n\nRe[Sij(?m)]\n...\n\nIm[Sij(?m)]\n...\n\n?\n?????????????\n\nand j ? i.

The matrices forming the diagonal matrices of A are given by,\n\n6By the calculation of S it is observed that the cross-spectrum is Hermitian, i.e. Sij = S?ji.

(4.21)\n\nFinally, ? is a vector with (M \u00b7 N2\u00d7 1) elements representing the measurement noise,\n\nwhich has been assumed to be Gaussian, with zero mean value and variance ?2.\n\nThe resulting equation system (see from Eq. (4.18) to (4.21)) will in general be under-\n\ndetermined. As a matter of fact, typically three degrees of freedom are adopted (namely\n\nheave, roll and pitch) while K = 72 and the number frequencies assessed is equal to\n\nM = 20. Basically, this means that the resulting equation system is composed by N2\u00b7M =\n\n180 equations with 72 \u00b7 20 = 1440 unknowns, thus reflecting a highly under-determined\n\nequation system7. In this thesis, as well as in other works in the literature (see, for instance\n\n(TANNURI et al., 2003)), the adoption of the Bayesian inference approach guarantees a\n\nstable solution.\n\nFollowing Akaike (1980), the Bayes procedure can be applied to the singular sys-\n\ntem presented by the Eq. (4.17). With such procedure, the estimation of the vector x\n\nis obtained maximizing the product of the likelihood function L(x|B) by the prior dis-\n7One may think that the reduction of the number of directions assessed (e.g. in virtue of the vessel\n\nsymmetry) and the inclusion of more dofs will result, at some point, in a system with a single unique\nsolution. However, the adoption of more degrees of freedom leads to A matrices characterized by smaller\ndeterminants (when compared with the ones obtained with a small number of dofs) and, therefore,\nresultoing in problem that are not well-posed.\n\n\n\n74\n\ntribution, where the likelihood function represents the probability of occurrence of the\n\nspectrum given an specific measurement, B.\n\nAs pointed out above, the measurement noise is assumed Gaussian with zero mean\n\nand variance ?2.

(4.22)\n\n4.4 Prior distributions\n\nAs it has been shown before, see Eq. (4.9), the posterior distribution of the variable of\n\ninterest is given by the product of the likelihood function and the prior distribution. The\n\nfollowing section aims to provide a brief introduction to the different prior distributions\n\npreviously adopted in the VMB wave inference method. Moreover, in this section the\n\nproposal of a new prior distribution is presented, which not only aims to improve the\n\naccuracy of the method but also the reduction of the computing time. This alternative\n\napproach addresses the VMB wave inference problem by means of the ABIC and the use\n\nof heuristic restrictions to solve the optimization problem. Regarding the performance of\n\nthis alternative proposal, it is assessed by means of a comprehensive comparison with the\n\noutputs of the prior distribution already adopted in other works of the group of USP, i.e.\n\n(TANNURI et al., 2003; SIMOS et al., 2010; BISPO et al., 2016) and (BISPO, 2011b),\n\nand that is adopted in this work as the reference benchmark for the VMB Bayesian wave\n\ninference approach.8\n\n8The goodness of the prior distribution can also be assessed as follows. Consider G as the probability\ndistribution function that generates the data as the exact model or the true distribution, and P(x|B) is\nthe estimated model. Then, using Eq. (4.10) the KL-Divergence is given by,\n\nI ? EG\n\n[\nlog\n\nG\n\nP(B|x)\n? log\n\nP(x|B)\np(x)\n\n]\n.\n\nThe two terms in the right side of Eq. (8) can be interpreted respectively as an accuracy term, given by\nthe logarithm of the generating function over the posterior expected likelihood, and a complexity term,\nobtained by the logarithm of the ratio of the posterior and the prior distribution. This means that models\nwith likelihood functions and prior distributions close to the real generating function and the posterior\ndistribution, respectively, receive low penalties. The relation given by the previous equation provides a\ntool to select models that reproduce observations well (high accuracy) without including too much prior\ninformation.\n\n\n\n75\n\n4.4.1 Conventional approach\n\nThe non-parametric approach adopted in this study follows the Bayesian modelling\n\nprocedure as proposed by Akaike (1980), which essentially aims at introducing various\n\nkinds of prior information regarding the directional wave spectrum to improve the so-\n\nlution of the ill-conditioned problem as well as to reduce the influence of the noise. In\n\nwave inference, the prior information essentially concerns the fact that the spreading of\n\nwave energy should happen smoothly (in frequency and direction). Mathematically this\n\nrestraint can be translated, among other possibilities, into delimiting the curvature of the\n\nfunction as it shown in the following. For this aim, let us assume that the value of the\n\nspectrum at direction, ?k, and frequency, ?i?1, can be estimated as,\n\nS??(?i+1,?k) = S??(?i,?k) + ?? S\n?\n\n??(?i,?k) +\n??2\n\n2\nS\n??\n\n??(?i,?k) + ? (? ?\n3) , (4.23)\n\nwhere S\n??\n??(?i,?k) stands as the second order derivative of the wave spectrum with respect\n\nto the variable of interest, in this case (?). Following a similar approach, the spectrum\n\ncan be evaluated at the pair of frequency and direction, ?i+1 and ?k, obtaining that,\n\nS??(?i?1,?k) = S??(?i,?k) ? ?? S\n?\n\n??(?i,?k) +\n??2\n\n2\nS\n??\n\n??(?i,?k) + ? (? ?\n3) , (4.24)\n\nNow, assume that we have two different models whose KL-Divergences are given by I = I(G; P(x|B))\nand I? = I(G; P?(x|B)). Thus,\n\n? I = I ? I? = EG\n\n[\nlog\n\nG\n\nP(B|x)\n? log\n\nG\n\nP?(B|x)\n+ log\n\nP(B)\n\np(x)\n? log\n\nP?(B)\n\np?(x)\n\n]\n,\n\nIt is expected that the output of the likelihood function of both models is approximately equal. Al-\nthough this is a strong assumption, it is known that there are several sea conditions that provide analo-\ngous minimum values for the likelihood function. Accordingly, it is accurate enough to assume that the\nexpected value of the likelihood is approximately equal for both models, leading to:\n\n? I ? EG\n\n[\nlog\n\nP(B)\n\np(x)\n? log\n\nP?(B)\n\np?(x)\n\n]\n.\n\nIf the estimation P(x|B) is more accurate than P?(x|B) then ? I &lt;0. Therefore the prior distribution\nof the first model is less informative than the second one. The relation obtained using a measurement of\nthe entropy between the posterior distribution and the prior distribution ensures, for the cases where two\ndifferent estimations are obtained for the same sea condition, that the improvement of the estimations of\nthe sea condition are directly related to the prior distribution selected.\n\n\n\n76\n\nCombining Eqs. (4.23) and (4.24), it is possible to estimate the value of the spectrum\n\nat the pair (?i,?k),\n\nS??(?i,?k) =\n1\n\n2\n(S??(?i?1,?k) + S??(?i+1,?k)) +\n\n??2\n\n2\nS\n??\n\n??(?i,?k) + ? (? ?\n3) , (4.25)\n\nThis approximation is possible due to the fact that the smoothness condition in fre-\n\nquency and direction domain can be introduced separately in the prior distribution, as it\n\nis shown later. Furthermore, the same procedure can be followed to introduce the smooth-\n\nness condition in the direction domain. Returning to the model proposed to estimate the\n\nvalue of the spectrum at the pair (?i,?k), it is commonly reduced to the truncated form\n\nof Eq. (4.25), as it is shown in Eq. (4.26).\n\nS??(?i,?k) =\n1\n\n2\n(S??(?i?1,?k) + S??(?i+1,?k)) , (4.26)\n\nHowever, when it comes to describe the behavior of the spectrum, the model pro-\n\nvided in Eq. (4.26) may present some shortcomings; due to the fact that it provides an\n\napproximation of the exact value that the spectrum presents at (?i,?k). Therefore, an\n\nuncertainty regarding the prior belief (Eq. (4.26)) is accepted,\n\nS??(?i,?k) =\n1\n\n2\n(S??(?i?1,?k) + S??(?i+1,?k)) + ?p . (4.27)\n\nwhere ?p represents the uncertainty of the prior model and stands as an approximation\n\nof the high order terms ( ??\n2\n\n2\nS\n??\n??(?i,?k) and ? (? ?\n\n3)) of Eq. (4.25). Regarding the main\n\nproperties of this uncertainty, it has been assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and\n\nvariance ?2p. Intuitively, the standard deviation determines how much the reconstructed\n\nfunction (unknown spectrum) departs from a line. In terms of matrices we obtain,\n\n?p = H S??(?,?k) , (4.28)\n\nwhere S??(?,?k), in this case, is the wave spectrum for a fixed direction, k, and H can\n\nbe directly deducted by identification from Eq. (4.27),\n\n\n\n77\n\nH =\n\n?\n???????\n\n1 ?2 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n\n0 1 ?2 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n. . .\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 ?2 1\n\n?\n??????? . (4.29)\n\nwhich stands as an approximation of the second order finite difference matrix. However,\n\nthis matrix has a rank equal to M ? 1, that leads to a prior distribution that is a de-\n\ngenerated Gaussian density function in RM+1. This is due to the absence of boundary\n\nconditions for S??(?,?)\n9. A possible option, as proposed by Nielsen (2006), is to assume\n\nthat in the direction domain the following relation is fulfilled: S??(?m,?0) = S??(?m,?k)\n\nand S??(?m,?K+1) = S??(?m,?1). Regarding the frequency-domain, the condition im-\n\nposed is that the power of the spectrum is minimized for ? ? 0 and ? ??.\n\nThis central idea was used for the first time in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000) to estimate\n\nthe wave spectrum from the motions measured on a ship with forward speed. In their\n\napproach, the trade-off between the good fit to the data and the smoothness of the solution\n\nis then controlled by means of a single hyperparameter, u = ?\n?p\n\n. In this case, the posterior\n\ndistribution is given by,\n\nL(x|B) \u00b7 p(x) =\n\n?\n? 1\n\n2??2\n\n?\n?\n\nN2\n\n2\n\nexp\n\n(\n?\n\n1\n\n2?2\n[?B ? Ax?2 + xT (u2(H1 + H2 + H3))x]\n\n)\n,\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhere H1 and H2 stand for the discrete second order derivatives of the estimated vector,\n\nthat can be easily computed considering the definition of vector x (NIELSEN, 2008), as\n\nit will be shown next.\n\nThe smoothness condition can be introduced through an approximation of the second\n\norder differences associated to the estimated spectrum (see Eqs. (4.27) and (4.29)) in\n\ndirection, ?1mk, and frequency, ?2mk, that are simply defined as,\n\n9A brief discussion concerning the boundary conditions is provided in appendix E.\n\n\n\n78\n\n?1mk = S??(?m,?k?1) ? 2S??(?m,?k) + S??(?m,?k+1) ,\n\n?2mk = S??(?m?1,?k) ? 2S??(?m,?k) + S??(?m+1,?k) .\n(4.31)\n\nAlso, it has been pointed out that the prior distribution aims at guaranteeing an\n\nestimated sea spectrum with a certain degree of smoothness. This condition is equivalent\n\nto keeping the following relations as small as possible (see Eq. (4.27) and Eq. (4.28)),\n\nK?\nk=1\n\nM?\nm=1\n\n?1mk = x\nT H1x ,\n\nK?\nk=1\n\nM?\nm=1\n\n?2mk = x\nT H2x .\n\n(4.32)\n\nwhere S??(?m,?0) = S??(?m,?K) and S??(?m,?K+1) = S??(?m,?1).\n\nIn addition, one must take care of another practical problem regarding the limitations\n\ndue to the frequency insensitivity already mentioned in section 3.3, i.e. wave frequencies\n\nfor which part or all the motions of the platform are null. As a consequence, any estimation\n\nin this frequency range therefore not supported by a proportionality between excitation\n\nand response. In order to avoid an over prediction of the spectrum energy leading to\n\ninconsistent results, the total energy of the spectrum is minimized in two pre-defined\n\nranges of low and high frequencies. This can be reached by minimizing the following\n\nexpression,\n\nK?\nk=1\n\nL?\nm=1\n\nS??(?m,?k)\n2 +\n\nK?\nk=1\n\nM?\nm=H\n\nS??(?m,?k)\n2 = xT H3x (4.33)\n\nwhen ?L and ?H are respectively the upper and lower frequencies of the range whose\n\nenergy is to be minimized.\n\nAccordingly, the posterior distribution in Eq. (4.30) can be derived using the relations\n\nprovided above. Moreover, it is worth remembering that the sea condition that minimizes\n\nthe relations in Eq. (4.32) and Eq. (4.33) is the same sea spectrum that would maximize\n\nthe product of the likelihood function, Eq. (4.22), and the prior distribution, given in\n\nEq. (4.30).\n\n\n\n79\n\nFollowing the idea presented in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000), Nielsen (2008) proposed the\n\nintroduction of an additional hyperparameter, thus leading to a prior distribution with two\n\nhyperparameters. In the resulting distribution, the first hyperparameter, u1, determines\n\nthe balance of the fit of the model and the smoothness in direction while the second one,\n\nu2, controls the smoothness of the energy distribution regarding the wave frequency. The\n\neffects of H3 on the final solution are addressed in (NIELSEN, 2008) by means of the\n\nminimization of the sum of the power spectrum in the frequency range where the ship\n\npresents no significant motions. Therefore, the optimal solution in (NIELSEN, 2008) is\n\nobtained by maximizing the following functional:\n\nL(x|B) \u00b7 p(x) =\n\n?\n? 1\n\n2??2\n\n?\n?\n\nN2\n\n2\n\nexp\n\n(\n?\n\n1\n\n2?2\n[?B ? Ax?2 + xT (u21H1 + u\n\n2\n2H2)x]\n\n)\n, (4.34)\n\nCommon to these previous applications of VMB wave inference is the fact that the\n\ndetermination of the optimal values of the hyperparameters has been done by minimizing\n\nthe ABIC, i.e. following the procedure proposed in Akaike (1980), despite the expensive\n\ncomputational cost that is required by this methodology.\n\nOther works in the field (see for example Tannuri et al. (2003) or Simos et al. (2012))\n\nused an approach based on the one proposed by Nielsen (2008), but including a third\n\nhyperparameter, u3, which controls the excessive energy estimation at frequency bound-\n\naries. Nonetheless, the main modification proposed in Tannuri et al. (2003) and adopted\n\nin subsequent works of the group of University of Sa?o Paulo, concerns the estimation\n\nof the hyperparameters, which are pre-defined in their apporach. As a matter of fact,\n\nthe use of pre-defined hyperparameters increases the functionality of the method, thus,\n\nresulting in a less time-consuming approach that may be adopted in applications that rely\n\non real-time data, such as decision support systems for offshore operations. Therefore,\n\nin this case, the statistical approach, followed to determine the hyperparameters, has\n\nbeen abandoned by these authors to increase the practical applicability of the method\n\n(TANNURI et al., 2003). Regarding the calibration procedure of the (pre-defined) hy-\n\nperparameters, it has been improved over the time by means of sensitivity studies carried\n\nout using model-scale and full-scale data, as it shown in (SIMOS et al., 2010; BISPO et\n\n\n\n80\n\nal., 2012) and (SIMOS et al., 2012; BISPO et al., 2016; BISPO, 2011b), respectively. In\n\nthis approach the posterior distribution is hence written as,\n\nL(x|B) \u00b7 p(x) =\n\n?\n? 1\n\n2??2\n\n?\n?\n\nN2\n\n2\n\nexp\n\n(\n?\n\n1\n\n2?2\n[?B ? Ax?2 + xT (u21H1 + u\n\n2\n2H2 + u\n\n2\n3H3)x]\n\n)\n.\n\n(4.35)\n\nwith u1, u2 and u3 known.\n\nTwo main motivations can be underlined among the arguments that lead to pre-define\n\nthe values of the hyperparameters in (TANNURI et al., 2003) and (SIMOS et al., 2012)\n\nas well as in (BISPO, 2011a; SIMOS et al., 2012) and (BISPO et al., 2016). First, since\n\nthe ABIC method implies multiple testing, the technique followed by Nielsen is very time-\n\nconsuming (TANNURI et al., 2003) and considered impractical for real-time applications,\n\nsuch as decision support systems. Secondly, some works, e.g. (ISEKI, 2012), showed that\n\nin some cases the results obtained with the ABIC do not provide the optimal solution. The\n\ndiscrepancies observed can be explained in those cases by one of the majors drawbacks of\n\nthe ABIC method, i.e. is its instability under certain conditions. For example, when the\n\nlinear model is not sufficient to characterize the sea state (e.g. when non-linear effects\n\nstart to have some relevance on the ship motions or when the ship has no significant\n\nmotions, leading to situations in which the Gaussianity assumption of the measurement\n\nnoise may not be fulfilled), it is usually hard for the method to distinguish solutions that\n\nare close to each other. In this case, the choice of the values of the hyperparameters\n\nbecomes unstable during the multiple testing stage and a non-asymptotic behavior of the\n\nsolution is reached, leading to erratic and inaccurate estimations of the sea conditions.\n\nTherefore, the approach proposed initially by Tannuri et al. (2003) with the calibration\n\nprocedure defined in Simos et al. (2012) will be the methodology adopted from now on\n\nin this work to assess the use of the semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor\n\nand to provide a reference for evaluating the quality of the estimation obtained with\n\nthe alternative prior distribution proposed in the following section. Finally, it should be\n\nnoticed that the maximization of the product of the likelihood function and the prior\n\ndistribution, given in Eq. (4.35), is then equivalent to the minimization of the following\n\nfunctional,\n\n\n\n81\n\nJ(x) = ?B ? Ax?2 + xT (u21H1 + u\n2\n2H2 + u\n\n2\n3H3)x . (4.36)\n\nwhich is feasible by means of a conventional quadratic algorithm.\n\n4.4.2 Alternative prior distribution\n\nThis section contains a detailed explanation regarding the proposal of an alternative\n\nprior distribution for the Bayesian inference method. Nonetheless, a comprehensive de-\n\nscription of the main shortcomings of the approach adopted by Simos et al. (2012) and\n\nBispo et al. (2016) is provided in order to enable the reader to understand the main\n\nmotivations that led to this proposal.\n\nLimitations of the conventional approach\n\nAs it has been pointed out in chapter 1, the results of ten months of a field campaign\n\non a FPSO platform were used in Bispo et al. (2016). This work highlighted the good\n\naccuracy of the Bayesian method to estimate the sea conditions that happened during\n\nthis period of time provided they were in the estimation range (Tp > 8s). However, in\n\nsome sporadic cases the authors also observed large discrepancies between the estimations\n\nobtained and the radar measurements, which were adopted as the basis for assessing the\n\nperformance of the VMB wave inference method. These discrepancies can be grouped\n\nas follows: (i) spurious energy peaks at the bow and stern of the vessel in beam sea\n\nconditions and (ii) global mean wave direction, when deviates from the expected value,\n\nhas a consistent and systematic error.\n\nIt is plausible to consider that part of the misleading estimations of the sea conditions\n\ncan be explained by limitations of the prior distribution adopted. Possible improvements\n\nof the prior distribution are:\n\n\u2022 It is known from the formal discussion provided in (AKAIKE, 1980), that the prior\n\ndistribution should be determined taking into account the measured data. Although\n\nprevious works developed by the research group of USP have been based on a pre-\n\ncalibration procedure of the hyperparameters (TANNURI et al., 2003), the current\n\nwork aims at providing a prior distribution which is computed using the measured\n\ndata without compromising the practical features gained with the pre-calibration of\n\n\n\n82\n\nthe hyperparameters;\n\n\u2022 As mentioned earlier, the likelihood function adopted works as a high-pass filter and\n\nit has the undesirable effect of amplifying the measurement uncertainties when the\n\nship is expected to present no significant motions, see Eq. (4.22). Thus, a mechanism\n\ncapable of properly computing the variance introduced by the points of minima of\n\nthe RAOs would be welcome;\n\n\u2022 The pre-definition of the two first hyperparameters, (u1,u2), showed several advan-\n\ntages, e.g. the algorithm is less time-consuming and a consistent improvement of the\n\nestimation has been observed. However, in some cases the values adopted for the\n\nhyperparameters are not optimal (see Bispo (2011a)). This effect may be related to\n\nthe point of minima of the RAOs, where the vessel is expected to have no significant\n\nresponses, but certain wave conditions may impose some motions leading to poor\n\nestimations of the sea state (see section 3.3.2). Also, the number of hyperparameters\n\nand the calibration procedure adopted may not lead to the lower expected mean\n\nsquared error, as it is shown by the Stein\u2019s paradox (STEIN, 1959). In addition,\n\nthis approach requires a pre-calibration procedure that involves numerical simula-\n\ntions and, in some cases, real scale data to validate the values estimated with the\n\nhyperparameters chosen. The novel prior distribution proposed does not rely on the\n\nuse of these hyperparameters, and therefore it is expected that this characteristic\n\nof the prior distribution will help to avoid some of the drawbacks related to the\n\npre-defined hyperparameters;\n\n\u2022 Despite the fact that the use of the third hyperparameter provides an useful tech-\n\nnique to avoid spurious energy estimations, this methodology restrains the estima-\n\ntion of the energy in certain frequency ranges in which the ship still has representa-\n\ntive motions and this can have a negative impact on the estimations of the significant\n\nwave height and mean period. Thus, the prior distribution proposed does not rely\n\non the use of a third hyperparameter, u3, whose influence on the final solution has\n\nbeen modelled by means of a method that avoids misleading energy estimations\n\nwithin the frequency limits.\n\nFrom the points listed above, the following can be concluded: For mitigating the errors\n\nof estimation, the uncertainties introduced by the RAOs should be properly addressed by\n\n\n\n83\n\nthe prior distribution. Also, a method to calibrate the trade-off between the likelihood\n\nfunction and the prior distribution is needed, at least one that would lead to optimal\n\nestimations of the prior distribution in the majority of the cases.\n\nAn heuristic prior distribution\n\nNext, the deduction of an alternative prior distribution that aims to reach the im-\n\nprovements suggested above is presented. This is followed by a detailed description of\n\nthe benefits expected with the use of this new prior distribution in VMB wave inference\n\nproblems.\n\nFor this purpose, let us assume that the prior distribution function of S?? is given by\n\na negative exponential probability distribution in the form of,\n\np(x) ? exp\n\n??\n?? ? Cx ?\n\n2\n\n2?2\n\n??\n? , (4.37)\n\nwhere C stands as a matrix of coefficients that must be estimated. Once again, this\n\nassumption is in accordance with the theory presented above (see section 4.2). Further-\n\nmore, this assumption allows us to estimate the variance of each element of the unknown\n\nspectrum, S??j\n10, as follow (see (BUI-THANH, 2012)),\n\nVar(S??j ) = ej\n\n(?\nRM+1\n\nS2??p(S??)dS??\n\n)\neTj = ?\n\n2ej(C\nT C)?1ej , (4.38)\n\nwhere ej stands for the j\nth canonical basis11 vector in RM+1.\n\nAccordingly,\n\nCjj =\n\n?\n? ?2\n\nVar(S??j )\n\n?\n?\n\n1\n2\n\nand Cij := 0 , (4.39)\n\nLet us assume an approximate solution to the problem (x?) be somehow known. It is\n\npossible to obtain the same estimation from Eq. (4.5) setting the matrix containing the\n\ndifferent weights of the regularization term D equal to the C. Now, it has been assumed,\n\n10In this case j ranges between 1 and K \u00b7 M. Thus, S??j = S??(?m,?k).\n11The reader is referred to appendix E for a comprehensive discussion regarding the size of the higher-\n\ndimensional space of the prior distribution.\n\n\n\n84\n\nheuristically, that the variance of each element of the unknown spectrum is proportional\n\nto,\n\nVar(S??j ) ?\nmax(x?) ? min(x?)\n|x?j ? max(x?)|\n\n, (4.40)\n\nNow, because the regularization term can be assimilated to an approximation of the\n\nmeasurement noise, as shown by the result obtained in Eq. (4.39), and aiming to facilitate\n\nthe computing process, the final expression of each element of matrix C has been adopted\n\nas,\n\nCjj \u00b7 Cjj =\n|x?j ? max(x?)|\n\nmax(x?) ? min(x?)\n?2 , (4.41)\n\nThis results in a regularization term that induces larger estimation errors in the frequency\n\nregions in which the sea spectrum presents small amounts of power or the responses of the\n\nplatform are not significant, which is in accordance with the results obtained by means\n\nof the coherence functions (discussed in section 5.4.2), i.e. the uncertainty of the linear\n\nmodel is larger when the platform does not present significant motions.\n\nFrom Eq. (4.41), the computation of the matrix C is reduced to the estimation of the\n\napproximation of the sea spectrum x?, that is also needed to estimate the jth element of\n\nthe variance of the measurement noise, ?2, as it is shown below.\n\nTherefore, the measured data will be used to compute the prior distribution. It is\n\nknown that the use of the measured data to construct the prior distribution can introduce\n\ndifferent correlations between the likelihood function and the prior distribution, resulting\n\nin misleading estimations of the sea conditions. Aiming to avoid any bias on the posterior\n\ndistribution, as well as to maintain the benchmark of the prior distribution proposed in\n\nprevious works, the ABIC method has been adopted.\n\nIntroducing the posterior distribution obtained by Nielsen (2008), see Eq. (4.9), in\n\nthe general form of the ABIC (AKAIKE, 1980), that is given by,\n\nABIC = ?2 log\n?\n\nPpost(x|...)dx , (4.42)\n\nThe following relation for the ABIC can be obtained,\n\n\n\n85\n\nABIC = N(N + 1) log(2??2) ?K \u00b7 M lg(?2) ? 2 log\n? ?? 1\n\n2??2\n\n?\n?\n\nKM\n2\n\nexp\n\n??\n? ? 12?2 J(x?)\n\n??\n? ,\n\n(4.43)\n\nFollowing the results obtained by Nielsen (2008), Eq. (4.43) can be rearranged as,\n\nABIC = N(N + 1) log(2??2) ?K \u00b7 M lg(?2) +\nJ(x?)\n\n?2\n+ F(?, A, D) , (4.44)\n\nwhere N, M and K are constants related to the number of variables, as it has been\n\npointed out in section 4.3, and J(x?) = ?B ? Ax??2 + x?T (u21H1 + u22H2)x?.\n\nIn order to compute the value of ?2 that minimizes the ABIC, Eq. (4.44) is differ-\n\nentiated with respect to the variable of interest (?2) and then set equal to zero, leading\n\nto,\n\nN(N + 1)\n\n2??2\n2? ?\n\nJ(x?)\n\n?4\n= 0 , (4.45)\n\nthat can be rewritten as,\n\n?2 =\nJ(x?)\n\nN(N + 1)\n=\n?B ? Ax??2 + x?T (u21H1 + u22H2)x?\n\nN(N + 1)\n. (4.46)\n\nTo compute Eq. (4.46), an estimation of the residual of the regularized objective\n\nfunction, J(x?), is needed. The objective function selected for this purpose is the one\n\nresulting from Eq. (4.34), which guarantees the smoothness and continuity of the solution\n\nin frequency and direction. Also, it is compatible with the hypotheses assumed. Since\n\nthe matrix C is expected to provide an estimation of the variance of measurement noise,\n\nthe values of the hyperparameters of Eq. (4.34) were set equal to 1, that also is consistent\n\nwith Eq. (4.41). Finally, an estimation of J(x?) is needed in order to compute the variance\n\nof the measured noise. Therefore,\n\nx? = (AT A + 12H1 + 1\n2H2)\n\n?1AT B . (4.47)\n\n\n\n86\n\nSince we are trying to approximate the variance of the measurement noise and Eq. (4.47)\n\nprovides the minimum of the objective function under the hypotheses adopted, from Hu-\n\nber (1965)12 we obtain that a single estimation of the residual of the objective function\n\nis enough, making the process less time-consuming. It is worthy to highlight that the\n\nobjective function selected will be indirectly included into the prior distribution and, as\n\na consequence, the adoption of this objective function assures a certain preference to\n\nsmooth solutions. Nonetheless, at the same time, it acts as a weak condition in contrast\n\nwith the maximization problem proposed by Nielsen (2006).\n\nThe resulting procedure may provide large values of Cjj for certain frequencies and\n\ndirections. In order to avoid unbounded values that would result in an unstable prior\n\ndistribution, the values of the elements of matrix C will be kept equal to or below a\n\ncertain threshold, as shown next.\n\nFrom the Gaussian linear regression model adopted, see Eq. (4.3), it is known that the\n\nmeasurement error is Gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance ?2. Thus, x is a\n\nnormally distributed parameter vector independent of ? with zero mean and covariance\n\n?2x,\n\n?\n?x\n?\n\n?\n? = N\n\n?\n?\n?\n?0\n\n0\n\n?\n? ,\n?\n??2x 0\n\n0 ?2\n\n?\n?\n?\n? .

(4.46) and\n\nEq. (4.47) into Eq. (4.53). However, this procedure, once again, may lead to unbounded\n\nvalues for the estimation of the unknown for the pairs of frequencies and directions linked\n\nto the point of minima of the RAOs. As mentioned in chapter 3, the zero points of\n\nthe RAOs may introduce some uncertainties due to the fact that waves with frequencies\n\nand directions that correspond to cancellations points of the RAOs, when the vessel is\n\nexpected to have no significant response, may, in reality, impose some motions on the\n\nplatform. This is because the numerical model for the RAOs is not free from errors (as it\n\nhas been shown in chapter 3). The procedure described below avoids this shortcoming.\n\n1. Components Cjj of matrix C linked to the cancelation points of the RAOs are set\n\nequal to the maximum of the output obtained by means of the estimation of matrix\n\nC.\n\n2. Also, components of matrix C near to the cancelation points and points of minima\n\nof the RAOs may provide, in certain conditions, unrealistic estimations of the wave\n\nspectrum. Therefore, if the corresponding values of C are less than a certain thresh-\n\n\n\n88\n\nold, then the values are replaced by this threshold. The estimation of this threshold\n\nis done be means of a linear interpolation between the maximum and minimum of\n\nmatrix C accordingly to the heave RAO, which has been select among the (six)\n\nRAOs due to the fact that it can be considered as an almost ideal response model13,\n\nthus providing a better prediction of the responses of the platform in comparison\n\nwith the other dofs.\n\nA formal description of the alternative prior distribution can be deduced introducing\n\nthe uncertainty, namely w, that the points of minima or cancellation points of the RAOs\n\ncan generate on the model. Since this uncertainty is unknown at the beginning, it can\n\nbe included into the inference model using a common approach followed in Bayesian\n\nnetworks, which essentially considers the uncertainty as a parameter of the distribution,\n\nobtaining the following equation:\n\nP(x, w|B)P(B) =P(x, w, B) = P(B|x, w)P(x, w) =\n\nP(B|x, w)P(x|w)P(w) ? P(x, w|B) ? P(B|x, w)P(x|w)P(w) .\n(4.54)\n\nwhere P(B|x, w) is the likelihood function, P(x|w) is the probability of x given the\n\nuncertainty w and P(w) is the probability of the existence of the uncertainty. Thus, if\n\nthe RAOs present a cancellation point at a given pair of wave frequency and direction, the\n\ncorresponding uncertainty (w) is assumed to have a probability of existence equal to one.\n\nAccordingly, see Eq. (4.53), the output of the inference approach will be characterized\n\nby sea conditions which present small uncertainties for points of minima and larger ones\n\nfor the maximums; this is in accordance with the discussion provided in section 3.2.2\n\n(CoV(s??n) = 1).\n\nWith regards to the numerical considerations, the resulting matrix C will have the\n\ncharacteristics described in the following. Furthermore, an illustrative description of the\n\nalgorithm adopted to estimate C is provided in Fig. 4.2.\n\n13An analysis regarding the linearity between the excitations and the RAOs of the platform has been\ncarried out in chapter 5 using coherence functions.\n\n\n\n89\n\nC =\n\n?\n?????????????\n\nC11 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0\n\n0 C22 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0\n\n0 0\n. . . \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0\n\n...\n...\n\n...

Therefore, the solution of the problem is given by\n\nthe minimization of the following objective function:\n\nJ(x) = ?B ?Ax?2 + ?Cx?2 . (4.57)\n\nThis minimization is also feasible by means of a conventional quadratic programming\n\nalgorithm.\n\nFinally, it should be stressed that the alternative approach proposed above is not\n\nintended to discredit the advances obtained by other authors or substitute the previous\n\nprior distributions14, but rather it is an attempt to improve the estimations of the sea\n\nconditions based on the observed drawbacks of the current methods.\n\n14The non-existence of a unique prior distribution that would be appropriate for any inference problem\nwithin a given model is established in (DAWID; STONE; ZIDEK, 1973), where the authors showed that\nthe existence of a unique prior is incompatible with a consistent marginalization.\n\n\n\n90\n\n \n\n   \n     \n\n       \n \n\nEstimate the measurement noise \n\n(ABIC): \n\n          \n      \n\n    \n      \n\nEstimation of the unknown,     \n\n                            \n\nEstimate the residual of the \n\nobjective function,        \n      \n\n      \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n     \n     \n\n \n\n \n\n     \n\n   \n         \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nMatrix   \n\n                                                            \n\n                   \n            \n\n      \n         \n\n      \n            \n\n     \n           \n\n                                                                \n\nIncrease the estimated matrix values for pairs of frequencies and directions near the points \n\nof minima. \n\n \n\nDetect the cancelation points of the \n\nRAOs and identify the equivalent \n\npoint of matrix   \n\n           \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n        \n              \n\n                \n    \n\nEstimate matrix  : \nAvoid unrealistic values of the \n\nmatrix  , keeping its values below \n\nor equal to the measured variance \n\nof the motions. \n\n      \n\nFigure 4.2: Schematic representation of the algorithm adopted to estimate the matrix C.\n\n\n\n91\n\nExpected improvements of the proposed prior distribution\n\nAt the beginning of this section a description of the main shortcomings of the prior\n\ndistribution as it is adopted nowadays has been provided. One may realize that the\n\nproposed alternative prior distribution is expected to mitigate some of these issues. In\n\nfact, the main advantages expected are (a detailed discussion regarding the attainment\n\nof these advantages is provided in chapter 5, based on the experimental measurements):\n\n\u2022 This prior distribution does not need previous calibration, in fact it is the result of\n\na self-calibrating procedure that relies on the ABIC information criterion based on\n\nthe measured motions;\n\n\u2022 Since the restraint (H3), that avoids unrealistic estimations of the sea wave energy\n\noutside of the frequency range of interest, has been replaced by the measurement of\n\nthe uncertainty in the points of minima, an improvement of the energy estimations\n\nin the high frequency range is expected.\n\n\u2022 Due to the fact that the approach proposed provides a prior distribution adjusted\n\nfor each sea condition, it is also expected that the computing time will be reduced.\n\nAlthough the prior distribution proposed above bring several improvements to the\n\nVMB wave inference methodology, it is also characterized by some shortcomings. First, it\n\nis important to highlight the fact that the formal description of this new prior distribution\n\nis not featured by a direct and clear physical interpretation as it is the case for the prior\n\ndistribution adopted in the literature. Moreover, in order to avoid estimations of spurious\n\nenergy peaks as well as poor quality estimations of the sea conditions, there are some\n\nassumptions adopted ad-hoc, such as the increase of the values of matrix C close to the\n\ncancellation point of the RAOs, thus resulting in a heuristic approach.\n\n\n\n92\n\n5 CASE STUDY: THE A?SGARD-B\n\nSEMISUBMERSIBLE PLATFORM\n\nIn this chapter, an assessment of the use of the measured motions of a semisubmersible\n\nplatform to estimate the sea condition will be made based on model tests performed in\n\na wave basin. For this purpose, the chapter has been organized as follows: First, a\n\nbrief description of the semisubmersible platform adopted as a case study is provided\n\n(section 5.1), followed by a description of the numerical modelling of the hydrodynamic\n\ncharacteristics of the platform (section 5.2). Such description also addresses the impor-\n\ntance of a proper damping estimation for predicting the heave resonant motions and the\n\ndifficulties imposed by the non-linear character of the viscous effects. The experimental\n\nsetup and the main features of the test campaign are presented in section 5.3. Finally,\n\nthe chapter includes a detailed comparison of the results obtained when using the prior\n\ndistribution recommended by (SIMOS et al., 2012) and the alternative prior distribution\n\nproposed in this thesis, both previously discussed in chapter 4.\n\n5.1 General description\n\nThe study carried out at USP for assessing the use of a semisubmersible platform as a\n\nVMB wave sensor has been supported by Equinor (see section 1.1.2), whose main offshore\n\ndevelopments are located in the Norwegian sea. Moreover, it was expected that only sea\n\nstates featured with large wave heights (here the reader is referred to chapter 3, which\n\nincludes a discussion regarding the semisubmersible hydrodynamic characteristics) could\n\nbe accurately inferred using this kind of floating platforms. The model employed during\n\nthe experimental campaign at the wave basin of the TPN-USP was a scaled (1:120) model\n\nof the Equinor\u2019s A?sgard-B (large) semisubmersible production platform. The adoption\n\nof the A?sgard-B platform as a VMB wave sensor was also motivated by the preliminary\n\n\n\n93\n\nevaluation carried out in (WIJAYA, 2009) (chapter 2 includes a review of the work carried\n\nout by Wijaya).\n\nFigure 5.1 shows an aerial photo of the platform as it stands today. The A?sgard-B\n\nunit was installed in the year 2000 in the A?sgard Field located in the Haltenbank area\n\nin the Norwegian Sea, 200km offshore Norway (see Fig. 5.1). The A?sgard development\n\nalso includes an internal-turret moored FPSO (A?sgard-A unit) for oil and condensate\n\nproduction, along with other facilities, such as the A?sgard-C unit (a storage ship) and\n\nseveral subsea production systems.\n\nThe structure of the semisubmersible platform is mainly composed of a rectangular\n\nring pontoon connected to the deck by six box shaped columns (4 corner columns and 2\n\ncenter columns). All the equipment necessary to operate the platform, such as processing\n\nfacilities, living quarters, utilities to generate power as well as the drilling materials, are\n\nlocated on the top of the deck supporting structure, at elevation of 54m. The platform is\n\nconnected to a spread catenary mooring system consisting of 16 lines and a flexible riser\n\nsystem consisting of altogether 37 risers (including simple catenary risers, lazy wave and\n\nlazy-S risers)1. A general description of the main dimensions of the A?sgard-B platform is\n\nprovided in Tab. 5.1.\n\nThe metocean data of the A?sgard (MATHIESEN; NYGAARD, 2013) provides an\n\nidea of how harsh the sea conditions might be in the region where the platform is placed.\n\nFor instance, the (omni-directional) significant wave height in this field is characterized\n\nby a mean monthly value that ranges between 3.88m (January) and 1.54m (July), with\n\na peak periods varying between 2s and 23s. Regarding the maximum (omni-directional)\n\nmonthly wave heights, the average value is equal to 11.41m, with maximums up to 16.5m\n\nduring the months of December &amp; January. Moreover, the metocean data shows that\n\nthe main wind (omni-directional) statistics are featured by a monthly mean wind speed\n\nvalue of 8.67m/s with a standard deviation equal to 1.51m/s and maximum values equal\n\nto 33.5m/s. Concerning the (omni-directional) data and statistics of the sea currents of\n\nthis oil field, the measurements carried out attest that the mean velocity usually ranges\n\nbetween &lt;0.05m/s and 0.6m/s.\n\n1The scaled semisubmersible platform model used during the experimental at the TPN-USP wave\nbasin include neither the elements corresponding to the deck nor the submerged systems (moorings &amp;\nrisers).\n\n\n\n94\n\nFigure 5.1: A?sgard-B floating gas production platform (left) and a sketch showing the\nposition of the A?sgard field in the Norwegian sea (right), from (STATOIL, 2014).\n\nVMB wave inference will be made based on the three motions in the vertical plane,\n\nnamely heave, roll and pitch. The adoption of this set of motions as the basis for esti-\n\nmating the sea conditions will be discussed thoroughly in section 5.4.2. At this point,\n\nhowever, an analysis of the dynamic characteristics of these motions is important. The\n\nhydrodynamic properties of the semisubmersible unit have been documented by Wijaya\n\n(2009). The unit presents a natural period in heave equal to 24s. The natural periods for\n\nroll and pitch are both well above the wave frequency range of interest, being defined as\n\n74s and 88s, respectively.\n\nThese sea conditions are characterized by large wave heights and peak periods. More-\n\nover, although the roll and pitch resonances are not expected to be excited, the sea\n\nconditions tested present significant amounts of energy close to the natural frequency of\n\nthe heave motion. Since it is known that the estimation of a linearized viscous damping\n\nis an important source of errors concerning the prediction of the resonant responses, one\n\nmay realize that this platform indeed has good response characteristics for being used as\n\na wave sensor. In fact, the very large natural periods in roll and pitch place their reso-\n\nnances well outside the wave frequency range, thus increasing the reliability of the RAOs\n\nof angular motions in this range. Nonetheless, damping corrections in heave motion are\n\nstill necessary, because this motion presents its resonance inside the range of interest of\n\nthe current study (focused on long period waves). These corrections have been discussed\n\nwith detail in section 5.2.\n\n\n\n95\n\nIt is worth to remember that the extreme sea conditions of the A?sgard field present\n\nsignificantly larger peak periods and wave heights that the ones expected, for example,\n\nin the Campos Basin (in Brazil). Notwithstanding this, the experimental campaign also\n\nincluded calm/mild sea conditions that may be more representative for other O&amp;G fields\n\ndifferent than the ones encountered in the Norwegian continental shelf.\n\nScaled model\n\nThe manufacturing process for the model construction took into account the geomet-\n\nrical complexity of the hull and the need to keep the model light weighted (in order to\n\nguarantee a proper margin for ballast calibration). Considering these restraints, the 3D\n\nprinting with nylon sintered material was selected as the best method of construction,\n\nexcept for the deck, which was made of medium density fiberboard (top sides were not\n\nmodelled, as the tests did not include wind effects). As an illustration a 3D sketch and\n\na photo of the scaled model are presented in Fig. 5.2. The main features of the platform\n\nin model scale are also given in Tab. 5.1. The inertial properties of the model (without\n\nballast) were confirmed experimentally by means of pendulum tests (roll and pitch). In-\n\nclination tests in still water were made in order to verify the metacentric heights. Finally,\n\nregarding the scale of the model (1:120), it was selected aiming at properly generate all\n\nthe wave conditions, even the ones characterized by larger wave steepness (h\n?\n), and avoid\n\nto exceed the TPN-USP wave basin limits (although a brief review of the main character-\n\nistics of the wave basin is provided in section 5.3, the reader is also referred to (MELLO,\n\n2005) for a detailed description for he TPN-USP wave basin).\n\nFigure 5.2: The 1:120 scaled semisubmersible platform model.\n\n\n\n96\n\nTable 5.1: General geometric and mass properties in full-scale and model-scale of the case\nstudy.\n\nProperties Full-scale Small-scale\nLOA (m) 102.40 0.853\nB (m) 96 0.800\nD (m) 45 0.375\nDraft (m) 25 0.208\nWidth of pontoons (m) 19.20 0.160\nHeight of pontoons (m) 8.96 0.074\nDiameter, corner columns (m) 19.20 0.160\nDiameter, center columns (m) 12.20 0.100\nDisplacement (kg) 8.27 \u00b7 107 46.621\nPitch inertia moment (kg \u00b7 m2) 1.56 \u00b7 1011 2.25\nRoll inertia moment (kg \u00b7 m2) 1.21 \u00b7 1011 2.23\nHeave natural period (s) 24 2.19\nPitch natural period (s) 88 8.03\nRoll natural period (s) 74 6.75\nGM Roll (m) 3.31 0.027\nGM Pitch (m) 3.32 0.027\nKB Roll (m) 8.36 0.069\nKB Pitch (m) 8.36 0.069\nBM Roll (m) 26.86 0.223\nBM Pitch (m) 27.07 0.225\nKG Roll (m) 31.90 0.265\nKG Pitch (m) 31.90 0.267\n\n5.2 Numerical modelling: Motion RAOs and exter-\n\nnal damping\n\n5.2.1 Introduction\n\nFor this case study, the body\u2019s hydrodynamical properties have been obtained with\n\ntwo different approaches: Frequency and time-domain analysis. The former allows to\n\nobtain the set of motion RAOs that are used in the wave inference process. Alternatively,\n\ntime domain simulations were were carried out in order to support the analysis of the non-\n\nlinear drag effects, especially those associated with large amplitudes of heave motions near\n\nresonance (see chapter 3). A detailed description of the procedures adopted during the\n\nnumerical modelling is provided next, including the analysis of the main results obtained.\n\n\n\n97\n\n5.2.2 Frequency-domain analysis\n\nRAOs were computed in frequency-domain using the software WAMIT. This software\n\nis based on the boundary elements method, also known as panel method, that employs\n\nthe Green\u2019s second identity to derive the boundary integral equations of a distribution\n\nof sources and doublets over the surface. Thus, the solution of the problem is computed\n\ndirectly by solving the boundary integral equation system obtained. Moreover, in order to\n\nproperly model the geometry of the platform the high-order method was adopted, where\n\nthe potential is represented by means of B-spline functions. In our case, the hull geometry\n\nwas represented by 52 different patches, which are described by smaller surface elements\n\n(panels) with lengths approximately equal to 5m (in full scale). Then, resulting in that\n\n4760 panels were used to defined the entire hull of the platform. Figure 5.3 illustrates the\n\ngeometry considered in this numerical model.\n\nFigure 5.3: Higher order mesh of the semisubmersible platform.\n\nFigure 5.4 shows the RAOs computed in frequency-domain for the heave, roll and pitch\n\nmotions. Results are presented for five different wave directions, from 180deg. (or bow\n\nwaves, see Fig. 5.5) to 90deg., beam waves (one should remind that the hull is symmetric in\n\nboth x and y directions). For the sake of illustration, RAOs were computed with external\n\ndamping equal to 0% and 5% (black line), which is a typical value for the external viscous\n\ndamping of this kind of floating unit and therefore provides a useful reference. The\n\nRAOs with 5% of external damping are only provided for the most unfavorable direction\n\n\n\n98\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\nHeave RAO\n\n180 deg.\n150 deg.\n135 deg.\n120 deg.\n90 deg.\n180 deg.-Damp.=5%\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nd\ne\ng\n./\nm\n\n]\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\nRoll RAO\n\n180 deg.\n150 deg.\n135 deg.\n120 deg.\n90 deg.\n90 deg.-Damp.=5%\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nd\ne\ng\n./\nm\n\n]\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\nPitch RAO\n\n180 deg.\n150 deg.\n135 deg.\n120 deg.\n90 deg.\n180 deg.-Damp.=5%\n\nFigure 5.4: RAOs for the motions of heave, roll and pitch.\n\nregarding for each motion, i.e.: 180deg. for heave and pitch and 90deg. for roll motion.\n\nFigure 5.5: Main wave direction relative to the platform.\n\nThese RAOs reflect the dynamic characteristics of the platform discussed in sec-\n\ntion 5.1: The heave motion is the only one with resonance (around 24s, see Tab. 5.1)\n\ninside the wave-frequency range (therefore, the external damping effect is only significant\n\n\n\n99\n\nfor the heave RAO); roll and pitch natural periods are around 74 and 88 seconds, respec-\n\ntively, and therefore their motions within the wave frequency range are not supposed to\n\nbe significantly affected by viscous effects.\n\nIn chapter 2 it has been shown that a proper calibration of the external damping is\n\nof major importance for an accurate prediction of the responses of the platform close to\n\nits resonances. Therefore, the adoption of unreliable external damping coefficients may\n\nlead to misleading estimation of the sea conditions that induced the measured motions.\n\nAiming at avoiding inaccurate estimations of the sea state in this case, a dedicated analysis\n\nin the domain has been carried out to feature the dynamics of the heave motion of the\n\nsemisubmersible platform and it is presented in the next section.\n\n5.2.3 Time-domain analysis\n\nAs aforementioned, the aim of the time-domain analysis is to evaluate the viscous drag\n\nforces acting on the pontoons of the platform and their impact on the motions, especially\n\nwhen large amplitudes are involved. The impact of the viscous forces on motion RAOs\n\nare widely documented in the literature, e.g. (CLAUSS et al., 2014). In the present case\n\nthe largest influence of the drag forces are found in the heave motion. A proper evaluation\n\nof these effects is necessary, especially because (non-linear) effects may lead to misleading\n\nestimations regarding wave conditions with high periods.\n\n5.2.3.1 Drag effects arising from the pontoons\n\nThe software used during this stage was the ANSYS-AQWA Hydrodynamic Time\n\nResponse package. Concerning the frequency domain analysis, the panel model is used\n\nto solve the 3-D diffraction/radiation problem and compute the hydrodynamic properties\n\nof the structure under study, such as added mass, potential damping and wave excitation\n\nforces. The time-domain analysis includes the beam model based on Morison equation\n\n(MORISON; JOHNSON; SCHAAF, 1950), see chapter 2, model that is used to estimate\n\ndrag induced forces (viscous damping force) acting on the platform by means of the char-\n\nacteristics computed in the frequency-domain. Moreover, due to the linear assumptions\n\nadopted, the models (in frequency and time-domain) can be combined and the advantages\n\nof both models are obtained through this approach.\n\n\n\n100\n\nIn order to perform the analysis in AQWA, the model was approximated by 11830\n\npanels using the low-order model. In addition, the parts of the pontoons between columns\n\nwere modelled as Morison elements in order to introduce the quadratic drag effects. For\n\ninstance, the added mass coefficient of these elements, Cm, was set equal to zero and the\n\ndrag coefficient, Cd, was estimated using the data obtained during the decay tests (which\n\nare discussed in section 5.3.2).\n\nFigure 5.6 provides an illustration of the heave RAO. Only the heading equal to 180?\n\nis evaluated here, because the heave responses for different headings show only narrow\n\ndifferences if compared to this direction (see Fig. 5.4). The WAMIT frequency-domain\n\nanalysis (with 0% and 5% of external damping) provides a basis of comparison for the time-\n\ndomain study. It can be seen that both codes provide similar results for the computations\n\nin frequency-domain with 5% external damping.\n\nThe figure also presents the results obtained for different regular wave amplitudes\n\nusing the AQWA time-domain package (indicated by AQWA TD). A first set of results\n\nwas obtained for a wave steepness of 2%, without considering the Morison elements on\n\nthe pontoons (blue circles). It can be seen that the RAO results obtained this way\n\nagree well with the results obtained from frequency-domain, as expected, due to the fact\n\nthat non-linear forces have not been included in the analysis. A second set of results was\n\ngenerated including the Morison elements of the pontoon, for wave steepness of 0.64% and\n\n2% (magenta rhombus and orange squares, respectively). These results, on the one hand,\n\nmake the effects of the non-linear drag on the resonant amplification clear (for periods\n\nabove 24s). On the other hand, they also show that the cancellation point (period of\n\nzero heave motion slightly above 22s) expected from the potential flow analysis ceases\n\nto exist when the drag forces are considered (the reader is referred to section 3.3.2 and\n\nappendix D for a detailed explanation regarding the origin of this cancellation point and\n\nits main features). For instance, the resulting excitation force of the heave motion would\n\ninclude a non-linear (extra) drag force component (given by Eq. (3.31)), which leads to a\n\nRAO that is dependent, at the same time, of the amplitude of the motion. Accordingly,\n\nthe value of the heave RAO close to the cancellation is expected to be in accordance with\n\nthe wave amplitude (i.e. the wave steepness), and therefore reinforcing the relevance of\n\nthe analysis carried out using different wave steepnesses.\n\n\n\n101\n\nFigure 5.6 also presents a set of experimental results obtained in regular wave tests\n\n(green triangles). All the experimental tests included, for different wave periods, were\n\nconducted considering a fixed wave steepness of 2%. One may notice that the experi-\n\nmental results confirm the main trends obtained from the time-domain simulations. As\n\nanticipated, these experimental results attest that a proper consideration of the non-linear\n\nviscous effects is necessary for a good prediction of the resonant motions.\n\nPeriod [s]\n6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\nHeave RAO\n\nWAMIT Damp. 0%\nWAMIT Damp. 5%\nAQWA Damp. 5%\nAQWA TD\nAQWA TD+Morison Steepness=0.64%\nAQWA TD+Morison Steepness=2%\nExperimental Steepness=2%\n\nAmplitude\n= 3.77m\n\nAmplitude\n= 3.77m\n\nAmplitude\n= 1.21m\n\nAmplitude\n= 3.77m\n\nFigure 5.6: RAO heave, for the heading of ? = 180?.\n\nFinally, it can be highlighted that the main problem, contrary to the results obtained\n\nthrough the linear model, is that for the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform the heave\n\nmotion RAO values (close to the resonance) will depend on the incident wave amplitude.\n\nThis non-linear effect must be included in the dynamic model of the heave motion of the\n\nfloating unit under analysis, topic that has been addressed in section 5.2.4. Regarding full-\n\nscale applications, the reader must keep in mind the importance of a dedicated analysis\n\nto assess the possible non-linear effects arising from the submerged lines of the system\n\n(i.e. moorings and risers) as well as the ones derived from the environmental conditions,\n\nsuch as winds and currents. As a preliminary evaluation, appendix F provides an analysis\n\nof the possible effects that the submerged lines may have on the responses of the heave\n\nmotion close to the resonance.\n\n\n\n102\n\n5.2.4 Viscous drag forces and damping linearization\n\nThe reasons why a refined dynamic damping model is needed for the heave motion\n\nwere already pointed out. From the experimental data obtained during the decay tests\n\n(see section 5.3.2), it can be observed that the critical damping factor is strongly correlated\n\nwith the motion amplitude, as expected. For instance, in section 3.3.2, it has been\n\nhighlighted that the damping effects in the heave motion are mainly originated by the\n\nvertical drag generated by separation effects on the pontoons. Moreover, this is attested\n\nby the estimations of the typical KC numbers of the flow, provided in Fig. 3.4, which\n\nshow that viscous drag effects on the heave motions become significant in sea conditions\n\ncharacterized by long waves. Therefore, a method to account for this matter and obtain\n\nan estimation of the linearized equivalent external damping for different Hs is needed.\n\nFor this purpose the assumption adopted, and frequently made in the literature, is\n\nthat the damping is quadratic. In fact, it is common to assume that the steady-state\n\nmotion with frequency ? can be written as, see for instance (FALTINSEN, 1993),\n\nz? + b1z? + b2z?|z?| + cz = Fz exp{i? t} , (5.1)\n\nwhere b1 is the linear damping coefficient, b2 is the quadratic damping coefficient and c\n\nstands for a linear hydrostatic restoring coefficient.\n\nSince the damping arises essentially from the pontoons, an estimation of the external\n\ndamping can be obtained in accordance for a given value of Hs, i.e. ? = f(Hs). This\n\napproximation is possible due to the fact that it is assumed that the platform responses\n\nare still linearly related to the amplitudes of incoming waves. Now, using the Morison\n\nquadratic drag force formula (MORISON; JOHNSON; SCHAAF, 1950), a correction for\n\nthe damping factor in the heave motion can be obtained as follows,\n\ndFd =\n1\n\n2\n?Cdz?|z?|dS ? Fd = b2z?|z?| , (5.2)\n\nbeing S the cross-sectional area of the pontoon and Cd the two-dimensional drag coefficient\n\nof the sectional area of the pontoon.\n\nIn section 3.3.1 it has been shown that the linearization of the drag force is obtained\n\n\n\n103\n\nusing the well-known method of equivalent energy dissipation (presented, for instance in\n\nFaltinsen (1993)). This method results in an equivalent linear drag factor (b\nEquiv\n2 ), which\n\nstands as a linearization of the drag factor (b2) and can be written as,\n\nb\nEquiv\n2 =\n\n8\n\n3?\nb2 ? z =\n\n8\n\n3?\nb2 ? Re{Az exp{i(? t + ?zz)}} , (5.3)\n\nwhere ? is the frquency and Az represents the (heave) motion amplitude\n\nThen, the resulting equation of motion would be given by,\n\nz? + (b1 + b\nEquiv\n2 )z? + cz = Fz exp{i? t} , (5.4)\n\nFinally, since the platform is characterized by a small potential damping, the damping\n\nratio can be approximated as,\n\n? =\nb1 + b\n\nEquiv\n2\n\nbcrit\n???????\nb1<<b\n\nEquiv\n2\n\n? ?\nb\n\nEquiv\n2\n\nbcrit\n=\n\nb\nEquiv\n2\n\n2 ?n (M + a33)\n=\n\n2\n\n3?\n?Cd A\n\nlpont (hpont bpont)\n\n(M + a33)\n.\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere hpont and bpont represent the height and the beam of the pontoon, respectively. lpont\n\nis the length of the pontoons in-between columns. CD represents the cross-sectional drag\n\ncoefficient of the pontoon, a33 the heave added mass for the heave natural frequency and\n\nM the total mass of the platform.\n\nTherefore, with an appropriate value of Cd, an estimation of the heave external damp-\n\ning can be made based on a certain representative motion amplitude. In an irregular sea\n\nstate, however, waves with different frequencies have different amplitudes. Nonetheless,\n\nfor the purpose of estimating the damping, the most relevant frequency is the resonant\n\nfrequency of motion. Keeping this in mind, an approximation for the representative am-\n\nplitude of resonant heave motion can be approximated as2,\n\nAz =\n?\n\n2Szz(?n) \u00b7 ??n (5.6)\n2It is important to remember that for regular waves a direct correspondence between the measured\n\namplitude, Az, and the estimated representative amplitude of motion (given by eq. (5.6)) is expected.\n\n\n\n104\n\nwhere, once again, Szz(?n) stands as the measured power spectrum of the heave motion\n\nat the natural frequency and ??n is the frequency interval of the spectral analysis close\n\nto the natural frequency (?n), or [?n ? ?(n?1),?(n+1) + ?n]. Since the measured power\n\nspectrum of the heave motion is known from the records of motions of the platform, this\n\nmodel, thus, allow the estimation of ? for each wave estimation event.\n\nIn the following section, the damping results obtained with the proposed procedure\n\n(referred for now on as variable damping model ) are confronted with the damping esti-\n\nmated from the experimental decay tests in heave, showing that indeed a very good fit is\n\nachieved.\n\nIt should be noticed that since the heave amplitude Az can be obtained directly from\n\nthe platform motion records, the procedure above can be used for pre-callibrating the non-\n\nlinear damping level prior to each wave estimation event. In this way, the implementation\n\nis quite simple: All that is needed is a database of RAOs computed for different damping\n\nlevels, defined within a specified range. At the moment of the wave estimation, the\n\ninference algorithm computes the representative heave motion amplitude and selects the\n\nmost appropriate heave RAO for that particular estimation.\n\n5.3 Experimental setup and tests description\n\n5.3.1 General\n\nThe model tests were carried out in the Numerical Offshore Tank (TPN-USP) facil-\n\nities, in the USP. The wave basin is a squared (14.0m \u00d7 14.0m \u00d7 4.1m) tank able to\n\ngenerate and absorb waves from 0.5Hz to 2.0Hz (see (MELLO et al., 2013)), by means of\n\na set of 148 flap-type wavemakers. Figure 5.7 shows a sketch of the wave basin and one\n\nof the horizontal mooring arrangements adopted during the experimental campaign.\n\nThe model was placed in the middle of the basin and its horizontal excursions were\n\nrestricted by a soft mooring system, above the waterline3. As a matter of fact, the\n\nobjective of the mooring was only to keep the model offsets within the range of optical\n\nmotion-tracking system. Therefore, the stiffness of the system was kept as low as possible\n\n3It is worthy to remember that neither mooring lines nor risers were modelled during the experimental\ncampaign.\n\n\n\n105\n\nin order to have little effect on the first order motions of the platform. The overall stiffness\n\nin both horizontal directions (x and y) was confirmed by means of pull-out tests, obtaining\n\nthat their values were both equal to 241.05kN/m, in full-scale.\n\nIn order to guarantee a small influence of the mooring system on the responses of the\n\npitch and roll motions, the lines were attached to the hull of the platform at a height\n\ncorresponding to the centre of gravity of the model (see Tab. 5.1). Furthermore, the\n\nresults of the inclination tests were used to ensure that the expected geometric properties\n\n(centre of gravity, metacentric height, etc.) did not present significant changes.\n\nThe adoption of a mooring system characterized by a low horizontal stiffness resulted\n\nin high resonant periods for the motions in the x?y plane, i.e. 113s, 116s and 87s for the\n\nsurge, sway and yaw motions, respectively. Consequently, the resonances of these motions\n\nwere not excited by the sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign, which\n\nonly presented energy in periods ranging between 5 and 33s.\n\nThe campaign comprised only one draft (operational) and five wave headings from\n\nbow waves to beam waves (in this case: 180?, 150?, 135?, 120? and 80?). Since one end\n\nof the tank acted as an actuator (generating the waves) and the other end was used as\n\na wave-absorbing surface for all the sea condition tested, the correct heading conditions\n\nwere guaranteed by means of changing the (relative) orientation of the model in the\n\ntank (always keeping the mooring characteristics unchanged). Finally, it is important to\n\nremember that during the tests, the motions of the model were recorded with a Qualisysr\n\noptical tracking system.\n\n5.3.2 Motion decay tests\n\nDecay tests were performed in still water for motions in the six dofs, in order to\n\ndetermine the natural periods and the damping characteristics of the semisubmersible\n\nplatform model. For each motion, tests with four different initial amplitudes were carried\n\nout, with three repetitions each.\n\nFor avoiding spurious excitation of motions other than the ones being tested, a specific\n\nset up was used for the decay tests. This set up essentially comprised a set of bars and\n\npulleys with a high resistance wire, used for moving the model and keeping it in the\n\n\n\n106\n\nFigure 5.7: Sketch of the wave basin and model (not in same scale), including the length\nand stiffness of the mooring lines. Adapted from Mello (2005).\n\nrequired initial position for each test. After releasing the model, all the motions were\n\ntracked by the Qualisysr optical system. Figure 5.8 provides an illustration of the time\n\nseries for the decay tests concerning the heave, roll and pitch motions, respectively (in\n\nmodel-scale). From this figure one may realize the similarities between the roll and pitch\n\nmotions. Furthermore, it shows that the three motions assessed are characterized by a\n\nsmall potential damping, resulting, thus, in time series of the decay tests featured with\n\nseveral cycles.\n\nThe method adopted for characterizing the non-linear damping in each test is essen-\n\ntially the one proposed in (FALTINSEN, 1993), which considers a linear and a quadratic\n\ndamping term (Eq. (5.2)). The former is supposed constant while the later is expressed\n\nas a function of the motion amplitude. For illustration purposes, Fig. 5.9 presents the\n\nresults obtained in tests for four different motions (namely: Heave, roll, pitch and yaw).\n\nIn this case, however, instead of presenting linear and quadratic damping coefficients, the\n\nresults are combined and expressed as a percentage of the critical damping ratio for each\n\namplitude (? = b1+b2\nbcirt\n\n).\n\nVariable damping model: A comparison with the results from decay tests\n\n\n\n107\n\nTime [s]\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150\n\nH\ne\na\nve\n\n a\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n]\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nTime [s]\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150\n\nR\no\nll \n\na\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nd\ne\ng\n.]\n\n-9\n\n0\n\n9\n\nTime [s]\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150P\n\nitc\nh\n a\n\nm\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nd\ne\ng\n.]\n\n-9\n\n0\n\n9\n\nFigure 5.8: Time series of the decay tests, for heave, roll and pitch motions.\n\nGiven the geometry of the semisubmersible, with the pontoons placed at relatively\n\nlarge depth, a comparison between damping estimations obtained from tests in waves\n\nand in still water (decay tests) is illustrative. For doing this, the method proposed in\n\nsection 5.2.4 for computing the heave damping from drag estimations was applied. The\n\nresults were generated considering all the 32 different irregular waves tested in the wave\n\nbasin, which will be discussed in section 5.3.3 (see Tab. 5.3 for data on the different\n\nirregular waves). For each one of them, a representative resonant heave amplitude was\n\nobtained according to Eq. (5.6) while the damping ratio was computed with Eq. (5.5). The\n\ndamping ratios obtained from the irregular wave tests as a function of the resonant heave\n\namplitudes were then compared to the estimations derived from the heave decay tests (see\n\nFig. 5.9). The agreement between the different estimations is shown in Fig. 5.10. One\n\nmay notice that the damping ratio estimated from the irregular wave tests (black dots)\n\nindeed presents narrow differences with the linear fitting (red line) of the data obtained\n\nin the heave decay tests performed in calm water (blue triangles).\n\nThe good agreement attests that the heave damping is indeed dominated by the\n\npontoon motions and that effect of the wave flow on the damping force is small, even for\n\nthe largest wave amplitudes that were tested.

For this reason, the wave steepness was\n\nkept below 4% for all the tests. The range of periods for the generation of the transient\n\nwaves was set from 8 to 24 seconds (values in full-scale), with a constant wave amplitude\n\nequal to 1.68m. Tests had a duration equivalent to 240 seconds in full-scale, guaranteeing\n\n4It is important to keep in mind that the effects of mooring lines as well as risers are not included\nin this assessment.

Again, the wave period ranged from 8 to 24 seconds,\n\nbut different wave amplitudes were tested corresponding to wave steepnesses of 2%, 4%\n\nand 6%.\n\nFigure 5.11 illustrates the level of agreement obtained between the motion RAOs\n\nderived from the wave tests (both for transient and regular waves) and those derived\n\nnumerically. Results correspond to a wave heading of 135deg. and comprise only the\n\nthree motions that were used for the purpose of wave inference (heave, roll, pitch). Due\n\nto the technical limitations of the wave basin, the estimations of the RAOs obtained by\n\nmeans of the regular waves with 4% and 6% steepnesses arrive up to 22s. Nonetheless,\n\nit can be seen that the agreement for the angular motions is good for the whole range of\n\nfrequencies. This was indeed expected because neither roll or pitch resonate in the wave\n\nfrequency range. For the heave motion, on the other hand, the agreement is good for wave\n\nperiods up to 20 seconds. As anticipated in chapter 3 and in section 5.2.3, discrepancies\n\n\n\n110\n\nrise for larger periods and are associated to viscous effects within the resonant range (see\n\nFig. 3.4). In this case, the numerical heave RAOs were computed with ? = 5% as well\n\nas with ? = 3.81% and ? = 6.89%. The two last damping values (3.81% and 6.89%)\n\nwere computed through the procedure proposed in section 5.2.4 and correspond to the\n\namplitude deduced from the transient wave and the regular wave with steepness equal\n\nto 2%, respectively. Since the effects that the damping has on the numerical roll and\n\npitch RAOs in the period range of interest are negligible, only the roll and pitch RAOs\n\ncomputed with ? = 5% have been included.\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\nHeave RAO\n\nWAMIT  Variable Damp. = 6.89%\nWAMIT  Damp. = 5%\nWAMIT  Variable Damp. = 3.81%\nTransient Wave\nRegular Wave Steepness = 2%\nRegular Wave Steepness = 4%\nRegular Wave Steepness = 6%\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nd\ne\ng\n./\nm\n\n]\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\nRoll RAO\n\nWAMIT Variable Damp. = 6.89%\nWAMIT  Damp. = 5%\nWAMIT Variable Damp. = 3.81%\nTransient Wave\nRegular Wave Steepness = 2%\nRegular Wave Steepness = 4%\nRegular Wave Steepness = 6%\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nd\ne\ng\n./\nm\n\n]\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\nPitch RAO\n\nWAMIT Variable Damp. = 6.89%\nWAMIT  Damp. = 5%\nWAMIT Variable Damp. = 3.81%\nTransient Wave\nRegular Wave Steepness = 2%\nRegular Wave Steepness = 4%\nRegular Wave Steepness = 6%\n\nFigure 5.11: Comparison of the (heave, roll &amp; pitch) RAOs estimated numerically (black\nline) with the experimental results, both transient (red dashed line) and regular waves\nwith 2% of steepness (green triangles), for a heading of 135?.\n\nRegarding the use of the heave motion for wave inference, these results show that the\n\npossible discrepancies close to the resonance can be mitigated with the use of a proper\n\ndamping model, which provides a better adjustment of the resonant amplification for wave\n\nperiods around the natural one. Another source of error, namely the one related to the\n\nmotions observed close to the numerical cancellation point, is, however, more difficult to\n\n\n\n111\n\nmitigate.\n\nIrregular wave tests\n\nThe wave conditions for the of irregular waves (sea states) were selected from the\n\nwave statistics of the A?sgard field documented by Mathiesen and Nygaard (2013).

It should be high-\n\nlighted that for the experimental campaign carried out with the semisubmersible platform\n\nonly long crested sea conditions were generated due to technical limitations of the wave\n\nbasin. Following the recommendation proposed in (TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004),\n\nsome of the sea conditions were generated using a double peak (in frequency-domain)\n\nwave spectrum, more specifically the Torsethaugen wave spectrum.\n\nThe sea conditions generated in the wave basin by means of this spectrum were se-\n\nlected based on the approach proposed by Torsethaugen and Haver (2004).

The procedure has guaranteed that errors in the values of Tp\n\nand Hs were lower than 5% for all tests.\n\n5.3.4 Wave spectra estimation from wave probes\n\nAs pointed out in section 5.3.3, wave calibration tests were performed in the absence\n\nof the semisubmersible model by means of an array of three wave probes. Figure 5.15\n\nshowed some examples of the sea spectrum measured. It included sea states generated\n\nusing a JONSWAP and Torsethaugen sea spectra, as well as different sea conditions.\n\nFrom this figure one may realize that all the different sea conditions were generated with\n\nreasonable accuracy.\n\n\n\n116\n\nExperimental measurements of the directional wave spectrum\n\nIn order to provide a reference for evaluating the accuracy of the seas estimated using\n\nthe VMB wave inference algorithm, an array of eight wave probes has been used to measure\n\nthe directional wave spectrum in the wave basin. Once again, the measurements were\n\nmade in the absence of the semisubmersible model. The procedure adopted to measure\n\ndirectional waves follows the one proposed by Nwogu (1989), applying the Maximum\n\nEntropy Method (MEM). A good explanation of the procedure adopted for estimating\n\nthe spectrum from the wave records can be found in Tannuri et al. (2007). The disposition\n\nof the wave probes is similar to the one proposed in Stansberg (1998), with six capacitive\n\nwave probes placed in the vertices of a regular hexagon with a circumradius equal to\n\n0.4m, plus two central ones. Figure 5.16 provides a view of the wave probes arrangement\n\ninstalled in the basin.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, Fig. 5.17 presents the results obtained with MEM method\n\nfor the irregular waves generated in four different tests, which were selected among the 32\n\nsea conditions in order to provide a representative sample of the whole range of periods\n\nthat was tested. In these polar plots, the wave energy in each wave frequency (radial\n\ncoordinate in rad/s, with values given in full-scale) is depicted for all wave directions (as\n\na convention, the wave direction in the tank was considered as 180deg.). In addition,\n\nthe main statistical parameters for each wave condition are presented at the top of each\n\nfigure. It should be stressed that, instead of the peak period, the mean central period T1\n\nis used for evaluating the results (as diescussed previously in section 3.2).\n\nAll the waves generated in the basin were long-crested, as pointed out in section 5.3.3,\n\nmeaning that no directional energy spreading was considered in the wave generation. For\n\nthis reason, one may realize that the wave spectra measured with the MEM method have\n\nenergy concentrated in a very narrow range around the mean direction (the directional\n\nresolution considered in the spectral analysis corresponded to ?? = 5 degrees, the same\n\nthat has been employed for the VMB wave inference, whose results will be presented in\n\nsection 5.4).\n\n\n\n117\n\nFigure 5.16: Lay-out of the wave probes array (left) and picture of the array before the\ninstallation in the wave basin (right).\n\nFigure 5.17: Irregular sea (full-scale) estimations using MEM for the tests: 2, 14, 25 and\n32 (left-to-right then top-to-bottom).\n\n\n\n118\n\n5.4 Directional wave spectrum estimation based on\n\nmodel test data\n\nThis section is divided in four different sections in order to arrange the results in a\n\nlogical sequence. First, a discussion regarding the optimal sample time for each sea con-\n\ndition tested in the wave basin is provided in section 5.4.1. Section 5.4.2 contains the an\n\nassessment of the motion basis (heave-roll-pitch) adopted for wave inference. The analy-\n\nsis of the adequacy regarding the motion basis has been carried out based on coherence\n\nfunctions. Section 5.4.3 provides a comparison between the outcomes of the wave infer-\n\nence algorithm obtained using the different sets of RAOs proposed in section 5.2. The\n\nVMB wave inference method adopted in section 5.4.3 corresponds to the conventional\n\napproach, whose reliability to estimate different sea conditions has been shown by the\n\nresults provided in different works (SIMOS et al., 2012; BISPO et al., 2016). Therefore,\n\nit provides a consistent framework to compare and select the most appropriate set of\n\nRAOs. In section 5.4.4, the main results obtained from this analysis are compared with\n\nthe sea estimations determined by means of the alternative prior distribution proposed in\n\nchapter 3.\n\n5.4.1 Selection of the optimal sample time for each sea condition\n\nPreviously, in chapter 4, it has been pointed out that it is usually assumed that the\n\nstationary time span of a sea state may range between 20m and 3h (the reader is referred\n\nto (SOARES; FRICKE, 2011) for more details regarding the stationary time span of\n\ndifferent sea conditions). Nonetheless, from a practical point of view, this assumption\n\nmay lead to a large uncertainty regarding the ideal sampling time (or optimal run length)\n\nof a wave record, due to the wide interval of time that this assumption involves.\n\nSince the main scope of this work do not include the analysis of this topic, only a\n\nbrief discussion is included here and a more detailed assessment of the procedure followed\n\nto determine the run length of each test can be found in appendix B. In theory, the\n\nmethodology followed should work properly if the measurement of the wave elevation of\n\na stationary sea state is used as an input (once again, see appendix B). However, for full-\n\nscale applications in VMB wave inference, only the measured motions of the platform are\n\n\n\n119\n\nprovided. It has been shown in appendix B that the statistical properties of the motion\n\nspectra cannot be assumed stationary. Nonetheless, certain applications, such as the\n\nsemisubmersible platform under study, that presents a fixed heading relative to the seabed\n\nand a constant operational draft, may provide reliable information about the optimal\n\nsample time through the measured motions. In order to provide a preliminary evaluation,\n\nthe optimal sample time for each condition tested in the wave basin was estimated based\n\non the measured motions of the model-scale platform during the experimental campaign.\n\nThis technique provides time series with the same statistical significance, since it aims\n\nat keeping the variance of a certain estimator always below a given value. As a result of\n\nthe adoption of the measured heave motion as the input to estimate the sample time, the\n\nestimator provided by Eq. (B.16) has been selected as indicator. Figure 5.18 shows the\n\ncoefficient of variability of the estimator for all the sea conditions tested in the wave basin\n\nas a function of the time, based on the measured heave motion of the model. Lines with\n\nthe same color stand for the same sea condition, with the continuous line being the first\n\nrealization and the dashed line the second realization of the same sea condition using a\n\ndifferent phase seed, with a total time duration of 1.5 hour, each. As a consequence of\n\nkeeping the model of the platform as simple as possible and the fact that the test matrix\n\nwas composed by long crested wave conditions, the coefficient of variability of the temporal\n\nvariance estimator selected was characterized by extremely low values. Accordingly, the\n\nthreshold adopted to determine the sample time was given by a coefficient of variability\n\nof the temporal variance estimator equal to 1.2%.\n\nThe resulting total sample time obtained for each test is provided in Fig. 5.19. In\n\norder to show a general idea about the results obtained through the analysis, this figure\n\nalso includes the estimated mean value for all the test conditions (41.5min) and the 25th\n\nand 75th percentiles, which are equal to 31.6min and 56.5min, respectively. Also, the\n\nminimum time used for the analysis, corresponding to 30 minutes, and the maximum test\n\ntime, 90 minutes, are included by the dashed blue and red lines. From this figure one\n\nmay realize that the optimal sample time for extreme sea conditions will be larger than\n\nthe sample time expected for calm sea conditions, as it is expected.\n\nThe largest sample time concerns the first realization of the test number 23. From\n\nTab. 5.3, it is known that this sea condition was generated using a JONSWAP spectrum,\n\n\n\n120\n\nTime [min]\n35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85\n\nC\no\n\ne\nff\n\nic\nie\n\nn\nt \n\no\nf \n\nV\na\n\nri\na\n\ntio\nn\n\n o\nf \n\nth\ne\n\n T\ne\n\nm\np\n\no\nra\n\nl V\na\n\nri\na\n\nn\nce\n\n E\nst\n\nim\na\n\nto\nr \n\n[%\n]\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFigure 5.18: Coefficient of variability of the temporal variance estimator for all the sea\nconditions.\n\nTest #\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65\n\nT\nim\n\ne\n [\nm\n\nin\n]\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nMean\n25 &amp; 75 perc.\nMax.  test time\nMin. test time\n\nFigure 5.19: Optimal sample time for each sea condition.\n\nwith significant wave height equal to 10m and peak period of 14.5s. Some examples\n\nof a comparison between the theoretical and the estimated spectrum obtained in each\n\n\n\n121\n\nrepetition are included in Fig 5.15. Test number 23 has been included among the different\n\nexamples provided in Fig. 5.15, and it presents no significant deviation from the theoretical\n\nspectrum. Therefore, the large duration of the wave record can be associated to the\n\nrandom nature of the statistical properties of the motions spectra and the extremely low\n\nthreshold adopted for the coefficient of variability of the temporal variance estimator\n\n(1.2%).\n\nIn order to provide a general benchmark for the results presented in Fig. 5.19 the\n\nguidelines presented in (ITTC, 2014) have been followed. As a matter of fact, the guide-\n\nlines proposed by the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) use the number of\n\nwaves (encounters), N, obtained during the test to determine the optimal rung length\n\nof each test and can be summarized as follows: (i) N = 50 should be taken as a lower\n\nlimit; (ii) N = 100 is accepted as a standard and (iii) N = 200 or larger is considered\n\nas an excellent practice. In this case, for comparison purposes, N = 200 to compute the\n\noptimal sample time. The results of this analysis shown in Fig. 5.20.\n\nThe results obtained following the approach proposed in (ITTC, 2014) are character-\n\nized by leading to lower sample values than the ones provided in Fig.5.19 (also included\n\nin Fig. 5.20). This is well illustrated by the mean value obtained for the outputs of\n\nthe ITTC method (equal to 34.4min) as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles, equal to\n\n31.4min. and 37.2min., respectively. Furthermore, the estimations obtained for some of\n\nthe sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign show values even lower than\n\n30min. Other characteristic of the outputs obtained following the ITTC guidelines is the\n\nstrong correlation between the recommended sample time and the increase of the incre-\n\nment of the peak period, as expected. Moreover, the right side of the figure shows the\n\nhistogram of the results obtained with a class interval equal to 1min, showing that the\n\nITTC estimations have a narrower distribution that the ones presented in Fig. 5.19.\n\nThe results obtained in Fig. 5.20 attested that the methodology followed in this work\n\nto determine the sample time provides, in general, larger run lengths than the ones ob-\n\ntained through the ITTC guidelines. As a consequence, the procedure adopted results in\n\nsample times that can be considered indeed, following the guidelines described in (ITTC,\n\n2014), as an excellent practice for the characterization of the sea conditions.\n\nIt is important to understand the possible effects of the sample time on the wave\n\n\n\n122\n\nFrequency [%]\n0 10 20 30\n\nTest #\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65\n\nT\nim\n\ne\n [\nm\n\nin\n]\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nEst.

For the sake of illustration Tab. 5.4 has been included, which for the time\n\nbeing must be intended as quantitative comparison rather than a qualitative one. In\n\nthis case the table provides the results obtained using the inference approach (which are\n\nanalyzed with further detail in section 5.4.3), for sea condition 23 using three 30min time\n\nspan intervals as well as the sample time estimated previously, i.e. 79.1min. Moreover, the\n\nmeasurements obtained using the wave probes (corresponding to wave record of 79.1min)\n\nare also included in this table as general reference for the estimations. From these results\n\nit can be stated that there are no significant differences between the estimations obtained\n\nregarding all the parameters evaluated (i.e. significant wave height, peak period and\n\nmean wave direction) when using different time lengths and intervals. Nonetheless, it is\n\nimportant to highlight the fact that as the test progresses there is a tendency that results\n\nin slight increments of the wave statistical values. This effect may be related to the small\n\namount of energy that is not absorbed by basin absorbtion system (see (MELLO et al.,\n\n2013)). However, it shows that if the stationary condition is not accurate for short time\n\n\n\n123\n\nintervals (see for instance (HAVER; MOAN, 1983)) the adoption of short sample time\n\nmay lead to misleading estimations of the sea states.\n\nIn this work the methodology described above, and which results are presented in\n\nFig. 5.19, has been followed to estimate the optimal sample time to estimate the sea\n\nstates. This approach will ensure similar statistical significance of the results and, at the\n\nsame time.\n\nTable 5.4: Comparison between the results obtained using 30min intervals over the entire\nspan of the test (90min) and the time estimated in Fig. 5.19 for test 23 (equal to 79.1m).\n\nRun Length\n? 1 ? 30min 30 ? 60min 60 ? 90min 79.1min Measured\n\n90\nHs 9.21 9.6 10.51 9.9 10.27\nTp 12.7 12.4 12.6 12.6 11.7\n? 179.6 179 177 180 180\n\n120\nHs 9.14 9.6 10.24 9.9 10.27\nTp 12.83 12.44 12.54 12.6 11.7\n? 178.7 177 179 178 180\n\n135\nHs 10.14 10.43 10.71 10.4 10.27\nTp 12.89 12.47 12.15 12.5 11.7\n? 177.9 178 179 179 180\n\n150\nHs 9.42 9.74 10.1 9.9 10.27\nTp 12.8 12.46 12.54 12.6 11.7\n? 177.9 178 178 180 180\n\n180\nHs 9.29 9.79 10 9.7 10.27\nTp 12.88 12.7 12.88 12.8 11.7\n? 179.5 179 179 179 180\n\nRegarding full-scale applications, however, this approach is expected to present several\n\nlimitations.

Secondly, it is\n\nalready known that the sea surface elevation time series (as well as the motion time series)\n\noften result in a non-stationary process, thus (in theory) the run length value estimated\n\nthought this technique may not be optimal. Finally, the results of this method may\n\nvary in accordance with the threshold value selected. For instance, if it is increased to\n\n5%, Fig. 5.18 shows that the expected sample duration for all the sea conditions tested\n\nwould be 40min., except for the test 23 that would present a run length equal to 45min.\n\nTherefore, for full-scale applications, the common practice of adopting 30min intervals\n\nmay be considered reasonable.\n\n\n\n124\n\n5.4.2 An analysis of the adequacy of the heave-roll-pitch mo-\ntion basis for VMB wave inference based on coherence\nfunctions\n\nPreviously, at the beginning of this chapter, it has been pointed out that the VMB\n\nwave inference will be made based on the three motions, namely heave, roll and pitch.\n\nThe adoption of this basis is primarily due to the analogy with wave buoys, which usually\n\ntake into account the set of motions with vertical movements as a base for estimation the\n\nsea states (see, for instance (TANNURI et al., 2003)). Next, the adequacy of this basis\n\n(heave, roll and pitch) is evaluated by means of coherence functions.\n\nThe degree of linear dependency between two signals can be quantified by means\n\nof the coherence function, which provides a measurement of the causality between the\n\ninput and the output of a linear system. For the purpose of this thesis, it stands as\n\nan assessment of the linearity between the incoming wave, ?, and motion response, ?.\n\nRegarding the output of this function, it varies between zero and one. Therefore, if ? and\n\n? are uncorrelated the sample coherence converges to zero. On the other hand, values\n\nequal to one indicate linearity between the excitation and the response.\n\nThe coherence function between ? and ? for a certain frequency, f?, is defined as\n\nfollows (BENDAT; PIERSOL, 2010),\n\n?? ?(f\n?) =\n\nS? ?(f\n?)S?? (f\n\n?)\n\nS??(f?)S??(f?)\n, (5.7)\n\nwhere S??(f\n?)S?? (f\n\n?) = S??(f\n?)S???(f\n\n?) = |S??(f?)|2. Thus,\n\n???(f\n?) =\n\n|S??(f?)|2\n\nS??(f?)S??(f?)\n, (5.8)\n\nFigure 5.21 and Fig. 5.22 show the coherence function values computed for the six\n\nmotions of the semisubmersible platform. These figures include the results obtained for\n\nall the 32 sea conditions tested in wave basin for beam and quartering sea conditions,\n\n? = 90deg. &amp; ? = 135deg. respectively. Due to the geometrical properties of the hull of\n\nthe A?sagrd-B platform, the results shown in these figures provide sufficient information\n\nabout the responses of the platform regarding other heading conditions.\n\n\n\n125\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n3\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n4\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n5\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n6\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 5.21: Coherence function for beam sea conditions.\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n3\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n4\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n5\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPeriod [s]\n10 20 30\n\n.\n6\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 5.22: Coherence function for quartering seas.\n\nFigure 5.21 shows that the coherence functions of sway, heave and roll motion are\n\nclose to one in periods between 10s and 20s. Hence, it shows that linear dynamics are\n\n\n\n126\n\nindeed dominant in sway, heave and roll motions in this frequency range. Nonetheless,\n\nthe values of the coherence function concerning the surge, pitch and yaw motions indicate\n\nlack of linearity between the excitation and the responses. This is due to the fact that\n\nthis motions (in theory) are not excited in beam sea conditions. Therefore, the outputs\n\nof the coherence functions are expected to be lower than one.\n\nReturning to the sway, heave and roll coherence functions presented in Fig. 5.21,\n\none may realize that close to 10s all of them present a local minimum, indicating that\n\nlow linearity is expected between the excitation and the responses. Aiming to properly\n\nillustrate the origin of this minimum Fig. 5.23 has been included. This figure shows\n\nthe coherence functions concerning tests 02 and 31 for the heave motion (in red), for\n\nquartering sea conditions. Moreover, the spectrum for each sea condition (blue line) and\n\nthe theoretical heave RAO (black line) are provided. It is possible to identify by simple\n\ncomparison that the minimum that the coherence function presents close to 10s is related\n\nto the cancellation point that the RAO presents at the same period. Similarly, the minima\n\nin the sway and roll motions in this period range are related to the zero points of the RAO\n\n(see Fig. 3.10). The values obtained of the coherence functions for the high period range\n\n(T > 20s) also show low values, which can be related to the small amounts of energy that\n\nthe wave spectra tested present in this period interval. It is important to highlight the fact\n\nthat the heave coherence functions do not present a minimum close to the cancellation\n\npoint of the heave RAO in 22s. As it has been show in section 5.4.1 it is expected, due to\n\nnon-linear drag effects, that the platform will present motions with significant amplitudes\n\nclose to this period. Therefore, the resulting values of the coherence functions indicate\n\nthat non-linear responses are expected.\n\nThe coherence functions for model tests in quartering sea condition presented in\n\nFig. 5.22 show that linear effects are dominating in periods between 10s and 20s, for\n\nall the dofs assessed. These results are in accordance with the previous analysis regarding\n\ncarried out using the result presented in Fig. 5.21 and 5.23.\n\nThe analysis of the linear dynamic model provided above allows the assessment of\n\nadequacy of motion basis selected for VMB wave inference. First, it is important to state\n\nthat the yaw motion in this case was not considered for VMB wave inference due to\n\nthe uncertainty regarding the full-scale inertia properties of the platform around the z\n\n\n\n127\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nW\na\n\nve\n S\n\np\ne\n\nct\nra\n\nl D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\n\nm\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n.\n3\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\n\nm\n/m\n\n]\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\nTest 02\n\nPeriod [s]\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nW\na\n\nve\n S\n\np\ne\n\nct\nra\n\nl D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\n\nm\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n90\n\n180\n\n270\n\n360\n\n450\n\n.\n3\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n [\n\nm\n/m\n\n]\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\nTest 31\n\nFigure 5.23: Comparison between the sea spectrum (in blue) for tests 2 and 31, top and\nbottom respectively, the heave coherence function (red) and the heave RAO (black).\n\n(vertical)-axis6. From the previous Fig. 5.21 and 5.22 one may realize that the use of the\n\nsurge and sway motions could provide relevant information about some sea conditions in\n\nthe low frequency range. However, for beam and head sea conditions, these will result\n\nin that at least two dofs of the base adopted to estimate the sea conditions are expected\n\nto present no significant linear wave excitations. As a consequence, these motions will\n\nbe predominantly driven by other factors, e.g. as winds, currents or even low frequency\n\nwaves drifting forces (WIJAYA, 2009). Therefore, the use of the 5 motions as the base to\n\n6The properties that the scale model of the platform presented were properly modelled for the numer-\nical analysis.\n\n\n\n128\n\nestimate the sea conditions, for this semisubmersible platform, will result in the escalation\n\nof the uncertainties inherent to the problem. Consequently, the base of motions selected to\n\nestimate the sea conditions based on the measured motion of a semisubmersible platform\n\nwill be composed by: Heave, roll and pitch.\n\nFinally, another use of the coherence function is the one proposed by Nielsen (2005).\n\nThe main idea is to use the coherence function as a normalization factor for the measured\n\nmotions of the floating vessel. This approach guarantees that motions with strong linear-\n\nities in a certain frequency range will be advantaged at the expense of the ones that are\n\nexpected to present no significant linearities. However, the lack of the physical quantifi-\n\ncation of the motion (it does not provide comparative values for different motions such\n\nas heave and pitch responses) of this technique usually leads to misleading estimations.\n\nThe method followed in this thesis normalizes the motion signals by means of using\n\nthe main dimensions of the platform. Therefore, the angular motions will be multiplied by\n\na certain linear dimension, i.e. the half beam of the platform or the half length, for the roll\n\nand pitch motions, respectively. This procedure does not guarantee that all the recorded\n\nmotions will present the same uncertainty (because the RAOs vary in the frequency range).\n\nNevertheless, the alternative methodology to deduce the prior distribution proposed in\n\nsection 4.4.2 improves this shortcoming by using the measured motions and increasing\n\nthe uncertainty of the estimation close to the point of minima of the RAOs.\n\n5.4.3 Wave inference using the conventional prior distribution\n\nIn the following, the results obtained with the wave inference method based on the mo-\n\ntions of the semisubmersible model are presented and confronted with the measurements\n\nperformed in the wave basin with conventional wave probes, with the following objec-\n\ntives: (i) to evaluate the impact of the viscous drag forces on the RAOs, as discussed in\n\nchapter 3 and (ii) to provide a general assessment of the use of a large semisubmersible\n\nas a VMB wave sensor.\n\nAccordingly to the results provided in section 5.4.2, the motion base adopted for\n\nthe analysis comprises only three motions, namely: Heave, roll and pitch. On the one\n\nhand, three different sets of RAOs were employed as alternatives for modelling the heave\n\nmotions: One with a constant external damping coefficient corresponding to 5% of the\n\n\n\n129\n\ncritical damping, which is a typical value for the external viscous damping of this kind\n\nof floating unit and is in accordance with the results obtained through the experimental\n\ndecay tests of the heave motion. Secondly, the set of RAOs resulting of the variable\n\ndamping method in heave computed following the procedure proposed in section 5.2.\n\nIn the third place, aiming at providing a reference framework, the RAOs derived from\n\ntime-domain simulations in the software ANSYS-AQWA with a wave steepness equal to\n\n2%, which includes the pontoon drag forces (see Fig. 5.6). As a matter of fact, this\n\nheave motion RAO has been adopted to assess the possible impact that the non-linear\n\neffects may have on the estimations. On the other hand, the roll and pitch motions are\n\ncharacterized by high resonant periods (see section 5.1). Therefore, these motions were\n\nmodelled for all the cases by means of the RAOs estimated through the frequency-domain\n\nanalysis. Finally, in order to estimate the sea conditions, twenty different wave frequencies\n\nwere considered, with a spatial resolution of ?? = 5 degrees (corresponding to M=20 and\n\nK=72, see chapter 4).\n\nRegarding the values of the hyperparameters, an extensive sensitivity analysis has\n\nbeen performed in order to obtain the optimal values. Thus, it was determined that: u1\n\nremains equal as the one proposed in (BISPO, 2011a), where the author proposes the\n\nestimation of the value of the first hyperparameter by means linear interpolation. For\n\ninstance, Bispo (2011a) interpolates the value of u1 within a range given by the interval\n\n[0.00208 0.02000] and using the mean zero up-crossing period of the heave motions,\n\nwhich must range between 7.5s and 14s. In those cases where the estimated mean zero\n\nup-crossing period is larger than 14s, u1 is assumed equal to 0.02. For u2, the optimal\n\nvalue is given by 1 \u00b7 10?5 and u3 is set to 0.0035. The small value of u2, if compared with\n\nthe value provided in (BISPO et al., 2012), arises from the narrow differences between\n\nthe beam and length of the platform, which produce complementary RAOs for roll and\n\npitch motions. This resemblance maintains all the zero points of the roll and pitch RAOs\n\nlimited to certain frequency ranges and, therefore, larger values of u2 are no longer needed.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, it is also important to remind that the VMB wave esti-\n\nmations were made considering the acquisition time determined in section 5.4.1, following\n\nthe procedure provided in appendix B.\n\nFor all the results shown ahead, the computations were carried out with a desk-\n\n\n\n130\n\ntop personal computer using MATLABr2014a, which contains the toolbox solver7 for\n\nnumerical optimization that was used to estimate the minimum of the objective function\n\nderived from the Bayesian approach.\n\nIn Figs. 5.24 to 5.278 the reliability of the estimations was evaluated by means of the\n\nrelative errors. Accordingly, the vertical axes of these figures provide the relative errors\n\nof the following statistics:\n\n\u2022 Significant wave height (Hs), whose relative error is given by,\n\n?Hs =\nHm ?Hs\nHm\n\n, (5.9)\n\nwhere Hm stands as the measured significant wave height and Hs is the value esti-\n\nmated from the model motions;\n\n\u2022 Mean wave period (T1), that leads to the following relative error,\n\n?T1 =\nTm ?T1\nTm\n\n, (5.10)\n\nwhere Tm stands as the measured mean wave period and T1 is the estimated value\n\nof the mean wave period. It must be emphasized, once again, that the platform is\n\nexpected to filter certain part of the energy placed in the high frequency range. For\n\nthis reason, T1 has been adopted instead of Tp, for being a better indicator of the\n\ndistribution of the energy.\n\nThe relative errors in the wave statistics are presented as a function of the (measured)\n\nmean period (T1) of the waves in each test, given in the lower horizontal axis. The upper\n\naxis indicates the corresponding (measured) significant wave heights, in meters, so that\n\nthe reader can easily assess the agreement obtained with the VMB wave inference method\n\n7In this case the optimization toolbox adopted uses the quadprog as a solver.\n8The prediction of the mean direction was very accurate for all the conditions tested. Therefore, only\n\nthe relative errors regarding the significant wave height and the mean wave period are provided in these\nfigures. Regarding the mean wave direction ?, the relative error may be written as,\n\n?? =\n?s ??m\n\n?\n,\n\nwhere ?m stands as the measured mean wave direction and ?s is the estimated value of the significant\nwave height.\n\n\n\n131\n\nfor different wave periods and heights. Moreover, it should be noticed that these figures\n\npresent three sets of results, that correspond to the estimations obtained using the RAOs\n\ndescribed above.\n\nT\n1\n [s]\n\n8.4 9.1 9.7 9.9 10.1 10.2 10.4 10.5 10.9 11.1 11.5 11.7 11.8 12.7 12.9 13.7\n\nE\nrr\n\no\nr \n\nin\n H\n\ns\n (\n2\n\nH\ns\n\n)\n\n-0.18\n\n-0.16\n\n-0.14\n\n-0.12\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.08\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.02\n\n0\n5% Damp.\nVariable\nANSYS-AQWA\n\nH\nm\n\n3.5 7.5 3.4 3.4 3.5 4.5 8.5 4.5 6.7 5.3 11.4 10.3 9.4 14.1 14.3 13.8\n\nJONSWAP\n\nTorsethaugen\n\nT\n1\n(s)\n\n8.4 9.1 9.7 9.9 10.1 10.2 10.4 10.5 10.9 11.1 11.5 11.7 11.8 12.7 12.9 13.7\n\nE\nrr\n\no\nr \n\nin\n T\n\n1\n (\n2\n\nT\n1\n\n)\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n5% Damp.\nVariable\nANSYS-AQWA\n\nH\nm\n\n3.5 7.5 3.4 3.4 3.5 4.5 8.5 4.5 6.7 5.3 11.4 10.3 9.4 14.1 14.3 13.8\n\nFigure 5.24: Results of the wave inference method estimated with different sets of RAOs\nfor the heading 90?, concerning the first realization.

The reason for this is that the results obtained for\n\nother heading conditions tested during the experimental campaign do not provide any\n\nmeaningful new information, as it will be shown ahead in section 5.4.3. For each heading,\n\ntwo analogous figures are included, corresponding to the two realization of the same sea\n\nconditions carried out in the experimental campaign. Based on these figures, a detailed\n\ndiscussion of the performance of the VMB wave inference method will be presented next.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMany aspects of the results presented above deserve attention. First, by inspecting\n\nthe error statistics obtained with the wave inference method, it can be concluded that\n\nthe overall agreement with the expected values is indeed very good for all the headings\n\nanalyzed.\n\nRegarding specifically the significant wave height, the inference method tends to un-\n\nderestimate the experimental values, with errors always below 18% for the most unfavor-\n\nable heading (90?) and only 9% for the most favorable one (135?). It must be emphasized\n\nthat the underestimation observed is indeed consistent with the expected bias of the\n\nmethod, since part of the energy in the high frequency wave components is filtered as\n\nthese waves do not impose large motions on the platform. It is also important to observe\n\nthat the level of underestimation and the difference in this level for the different headings\n\ntend to decrease as the wave period increases, thus favoring the results for the most severe\n\nsea states.\n\nThe results obtained for the predicted mean wave periods (T1) are also consistent with\n\nthe bias of the method. Since energy is filtered from the wave components with higher\n\nfrequencies, the mean frequency of the estimated spectrum tends to be lower than the\n\nreal one and, consequently, the mean period tends to be higher. Nonetheless, the results\n\nshow that differences are not large, with errors below 15% in all cases. Once again, the\n\nerrors decrease for larger wave periods, as should be expected.\n\nFigures 5.24 to 5.26 also allow an assessment of the influence of the different heave\n\nRAO models on the VMB predictions. It is interesting to realize that the main influence\n\n\n\n136\n\narising from the consideration of pontoon drag effects occurs in the estimation of the\n\nsignificant wave height. Moreover, the discrepancies in the wave height predicted by\n\nthe different models increase for larger periods. This was already expected and happens\n\ndue to the fact that these waves induce resonant heave motions, where the three sets\n\nof RAOs adopted behave differently. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that the\n\nresults obtained for the Torsethaugen wave spectrum show larger discrepancies between\n\nthe three models. This is due to fact that in general the Torsethaugen condition are\n\nestimated with less accuracy than the JONSWAP sea condition, as a consequence of\n\nfiltering the high frequency components of the spectrum. Therefore, small changes in\n\nthe low frequency range lead to more relevant differences than in sea states generated by\n\nmeans of the JONSWAP sea spectrum.\n\nSince the results provided in this figures are characterized by a large variability, which\n\nmakes it difficult to identify a clear tendency among the results obtained, a more detailed\n\nanalysis of the results provided in the figures above is done next.\n\nAs pointed out in section 5.2.3 and in the previous section, the set of RAOs derived\n\nfrom the time-domain simulations allows a sensitivity analysis of the effects that non-linear\n\nresponses may have on the estimation. However, the usefulness of the RAOs obtained\n\nnumerically is limited due to the fact that the main characteristics of the sea conditions\n\nshould be known a priori in order to compute the most appropriate set of RAOs. Conse-\n\nquently, only the sets of RAOs obtained through the variable damping model or assuming\n\na constant damping model are eligible, in practice. It is worth remembering that the\n\nRAOs derived from time domain simulations have been included in order to provide a\n\nreference benchmark, thus allowing an early assessment of the possible effect that may\n\narise if non-linear dynamics are take into account. For instance, the results obtained show\n\nthat large discrepancies are not expected.\n\nOne may find that the results in the Figs. 5.24 to 5.27 are somewhat inconclusive when\n\nit comes to selecting the most appropriate set of RAOs. Therefore, aiming to provide all\n\nthe data in a suitable and manageable form, Tab. 5.5 is included herein. This table\n\nprovides the mean value of the relative errors (regarding the significant wave height and\n\nthe mean wave period) obtained from both headings analyzed and the two sea realizations.\n\nAlso, the results are clustered by the model of RAOs used. The differences between the\n\n\n\n137\n\nresults predicted adopting different models increase for larger periods, due to the induced\n\nheave motions near the resonance. Therefore, only the 10 sea conditions with the largest\n\nmean wave periods have been included in the table.\n\nTable 5.5: Mean of the relative errors measured during the experimental campaign for Hs\nand T1, regarding the ten sea conditions with the largest mean wave periods.\n\n?Hs ?T1\nT1 V ar.Damp. 5%Damp.

Although the variable damping model in general\n\nprovides slightly smaller values for the relative errors of the significant wave height and\n\nmean wave period than the constant damping model (in Tab. 5.5) none of these models can\n\nbe conclusively selected as the most accurate. However, due to the practical advantages\n\nthat the variable damping model provides, such as the fact that it does not rely on any\n\nexperiment tests, it will be adopted in this thesis.\n\nFor a first assessment of the other statistical parameters, namely the mean wave di-\n\nrection and the wave spreading, Figs. 5.28 and 5.29 provide the directional wave spectra\n\nestimated for the same sea conditions previously displayed in Fig. 5.17, for the two differ-\n\nent heading conditions. These spectra were estimated using the set of RAOs computed\n\nby means of the variable damping model. In these figures, the accuracy regarding the\n\nestimation of the mean wave direction (?) can be assessed reminding that the expected\n\nwave direction in the wave basin is always 180?. Although all these examples are provided\n\nfor illustration purposes due to the fact that only long crested wave conditions were gen-\n\nerated in the basin, more results of the directional sea spectrum obtained by means the\n\nconventional approach can be assessed in Figs. 5.39 and 5.40.\n\n\n\n138\n\nThe spreading of the measured wave spectrum is larger than the one estimated by\n\nmeans of wave probes and the using MEM. The larger spreading of wave energy when using\n\nthe Bayesian inference method is related to the calibration of the hyper-parameter u1,\n\nwhich controls the level of smoothness of the spectrum with respect to the wave direction.\n\nIn this case, the pre-calibration of the hyparameter was made seeking to improve the\n\naccuracy in the prediction of the main statistical wave parameters (T1, Hs and ?), a\n\nprocedure that ultimately tends to lead to a larger wave spreading. Notwithstanding this,\n\nthe sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign (long crested) do not stand\n\nas the most appropriate sea condition to assess the reliability of the direction spreading.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the prior distribution adopted results from the assumption that the\n\nsea spectrum must be smooth in frequency and direction. Thus, the long crested sea\n\nconditions tested during the experimental campaign stand as limiting conditions for the\n\nwave inference method adopted (see, for instance section 4.4).\n\nThe results in Figs. 5.24 to 5.27 show that the spreading increases for sea conditions\n\ncharacterized with higher peak periods. This is due to the fact that in severe sea conditions\n\nthe amount of energy close to the zero point of the heave RAO (around 22s) is larger than\n\nin mild/calm sea states. Therefore, in these conditions the resulting directional spreading\n\nof the spectrum may be larger.\n\nIn addition to the graphical results above, Tab. 5.6 provides the mean values of the\n\nerrors obtained not only for beam and quartering wave conditions, but also for the other\n\nwave headings adopted in the tests. Again, the results stand for the estimations obtained\n\nadopting the variable damping model. The values provided in this table are the expected\n\nvalue of all the estimated mean relative errors computed for significant wave height and\n\nthe mean wave period. In order to maintain the table suitable and manageable, the\n\nresults were clustered in four different intervals, given by the corresponding theoretical\n\npeak periods of the wave spectra. Also, the absolute error of the estimated direction is\n\nincluded, in degrees. Finally, the relative errors are presented separately for JONSWAP\n\nand Torsethaugen spectra, to avoid the introduction of a bias in the groups.\n\nConsidering the whole range of wave periods tested, Tab. 5.6 attest that the maximum\n\nexpected errors involved in the prediction of wave height and period are around 10% for\n\nJONSWAP seas, and 15% for the conditions corresponding to the bimodal Torsethaugen\n\n\n\n139\n\nFigure 5.28: Wave spectra estimated using variable damping for the heading 90?, regarding\nthe first realization of the sea conditions 2, 14, 25 and 32.\n\nspectra.\n\nRegarding the shape of the wave spectrum, one may realize that the relative errors\n\n(for significant wave height and mean period) are amplified by the Torsethaugen model\n\nfor all the wave headings. Again, this is not surprising since, compared to the JONSWAP\n\nmodel (see figure 3.1), the Torsethaugen spectrum places a larger amount of energy in the\n\nhigh frequency range, for which the dynamic response of the model is less pronounced.\n\nFurthermore, the whole set of results show that the most unfavorable headings are\n\nthose of bow (180?) and beam (90?) waves. Once again, this was expected because these\n\nare the situations when only 2 of the 3 motions used for the estimations are excited by\n\nthe waves. On the other hand, the most favorable conditions are those closer to 135? (or\n\n45?), when all the 3 motions are excited and thus the amount of information available for\n\nthe estimations is larger. These patterns are shown in Fig. 5.30, which presents the mean\n\n\n\n140\n\nFigure 5.29: Wave spectra estimated using variable damping for the heading 135?, re-\ngarding the first realization.\n\nof relative errors for Hs and Tp (shown in previous table) in accordance with the heading\n\ncondition. In this figure the data have been categorized in two different sets: blue markers,\n\nwhich stand for the error related to the sea conditions generated using the JONSWAP\n\nwave spectrum; and red markers, that represent the errors for the Torsethaugen wave\n\nconditions.\n\nWhen the mean wave direction is concerned (see also, Fig. 5.28 and Fig. 5.29), al-\n\nthough the estimated spectra present a somewhat larger spreading of energy if compared\n\nto those obtained from the wave probes, the prediction of the mean direction was very\n\naccurate for all the conditions tested. For instance, in all the conditions assessed during\n\nthe experimental campaign it remained smaller than 3deg..\n\nFinally, to conclude the discussion of the main aspects, some additional comments\n\nregarding the prediction of the most several conditions must be made. In fact, it is im-\n\n\n\n141\n\nTable 5.6: Mean of the relative errors measured during the experimental campaign for Hs\nand T1, computed using the estimations obtained through the two realizations.\n\nJONSWAP Torsethaugen\nTp T1 (%) Hs (%) ??(\n\n?)

The lines included in the plots stand as the quadratic\nfitting for each set of points (i.e. blue and red).\n\nportant to realize that wave conditions with mean periods above to 12.7s., that correspond\n\nto 100 years return period sea conditions of the A?sgard field, could be captured by the\n\nVMB method with errors equal or lower than 10% in both wave height and period (for\n\n\n\n142\n\nestimations obtained using the variable damping). These conditions involved waves with\n\nHs up to 16 meters and peak periods close to 20 seconds, which represent quite extreme\n\nwaves. Obviously, one must remind that these good results were obtained in model-scale,\n\nin very controlled conditions. When considering the estimations made aboard a full-scale\n\nunit, other factors like short crested wave conditions as well as the presence of risers\n\nand mooring lines and the effects of wind and current on the motions, for example, will\n\ncertainly impose a more demanding scenario for the predictions.\n\n5.4.4 Wave Inference using the alternative prior distribution\n\nIn the following, a detailed comparison between the results obtained with the analysis\n\npresented above and those obtained with the alternative prior distribution (see section\n\n4.4.2) is provided. Again, the set of RAOs adopted in this section was obtained with the\n\nvariable damping model, which stands as the most appropriate damping approximation.\n\nIn order to provide an effective and proper visual formatting for the comparison of\n\nthe results, a different arrangement is adopted: A representation of the distribution of\n\nthe ratio between the value of the estimation and the measured value, for all the heading\n\nconditions (five), in terms of box-plots, plus the indication of 5% and 95% estimated\n\npercentile values.

Finally, it is interesting to\n\npoint out that the differences between the estimations for different headings are reduced\n\nfor sea conditions with large mean wave periods. This trend, that can be explained by\n\nthe fact that in extreme sea conditions large amount of information is provided by the\n\nplatform motions, is clearly shown in Figs. 5.31 and 5.32.\n\nSimilarly, Figs. 5.34 to 5.36 provide the results obtained using the alternative prior\n\ndistribution, described in section 4.4.2. In this case, as it has been pointed out before,\n\nthe set of RAOs has also been determined with the variable damping model. In general,\n\nthe results obtained show a clear improvement of the estimations regarding the mean\n\nwave period (see Figs. 5.31 and 5.34, respectively), T1. Furthermore, for calm to mild\n\nsea conditions the alternative prior distribution seems to result in a lower loss of energy.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Fig. 5.35 shows a significant improvement on the estimation of the\n\nsignificant wave height for sea conditions characterized with low mean wave periods, if\n\ncompared with the results obtained with the conventional prior distribution and presented\n\nin Fig. 5.32.\n\n\n\n145\n\nT\n1\n/T\n\n1\ne\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\n1.15\n\n1.2\n\n1.25\nH=90\nH=120\nH=135\nH=150\nH=180\n\nT\n1\n(s)\n\n8.4 9.1 9.7 9.9 10.1 10.2 10.4 10.5 10.9 11.1 11.5 11.7 11.8 12.7 12.9 13.7\n\nH\ns\n\n3.5 7.5 3.4 3.4 3.5 4.5 8.5 4.5 6.7 5.3 11.4 10.3 9.4 14.1 14.3 13.8\n\nFigure 5.34: Box-plot showing the ratio between the estimated and measured mean wave\nperiod, obtained by means of the alternative prior distribution.\n\nH\ns\n/H\n\ns\ne\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\n1.15\n\n1.2\n\n1.25\nH=90\nH=120\nH=135\nH=150\nH=180\n\nT\n1\n(s)\n\n8.4 9.1 9.7 9.9 10.1 10.2 10.4 10.5 10.9 11.1 11.5 11.7 11.8 12.7 12.9 13.7\n\nH\ns\n\n3.5 7.5 3.4 3.4 3.5 4.5 8.5 4.5 6.7 5.3 11.4 10.3 9.4 14.1 14.3 13.8\n\nFigure 5.35: Box-plot showing the ratio between the estimated and measured significant\nwave height, obtained by means of the alternative prior distribution.\n\nA clear disadvantage that arises from the use of the alternative prior distribution is\n\nthat it tends to overestimate the energy of the wave spectrum (or the significant wave\n\n\n\n146\n\n3\n/3\n\ne\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\n1.15\n\n1.2\n\n1.25\nH=90\nH=120\nH=135\nH=150\nH=180\n\nT\n1\n(s)\n\n8.4 9.1 9.7 9.9 10.1 10.2 10.4 10.5 10.9 11.1 11.5 11.7 11.8 12.7 12.9 13.7\n\nH\ns\n\n3.5 7.5 3.4 3.4 3.5 4.5 8.5 4.5 6.7 5.3 11.4 10.3 9.4 14.1 14.3 13.8\n\nFigure 5.36: Box-plot showing the ratio between the estimated and measured mean wave\ndirection, obtained by means of the alternative prior distribution.\n\nheight) in some cases. Also, the variability of the results for the same sea state obtained\n\nwith different headings has been increased, leading to differences up to 18% between the\n\nestimations of Hs. In a similar way the estimations of the mean wave direction present\n\nthe same pattern regarding the increment of variability of the estimation in accordance\n\nwith the heading of the platform.\n\nFigures 5.37 and 5.38 provide the energy spectrum in frequency-domain for different\n\nsea conditions tested. These figures include the theoretical spectrum (dashed black line),\n\nthe measured spectrum (dashed green line) and the estimations obtained with the con-\n\nventional and the alternative prior distribution, that correspond to the red and blue lines\n\nrespectively. In general the results of the alternative prior distribution seems to provide\n\nestimations of the energy spectrum similar to the ones obtained through the alternative\n\napproach.\n\nThe influence of the cancellation points of the base of motions adopted to estimate\n\nthe sea conditions may become meaningful for some sea conditions with large amounts of\n\nenergy in the high frequency range (see for example sea condition 6, 12 and 15 in Fig. 5.37).\n\nThus, resulting in some discrepancies with the measured wave spectra. For instance, the\n\n\n\n147\n\nresults of the alternative prior distribution are characterized by the overestimation of\n\nthe energy close to periods of 9.2s. Regarding the low frequency range, although in\n\none sea condition the energy peak is underestimated with the alternative approach (i.e.\n\nsea condition 12 in Fig. 5.37), the energy distribution for the remaining cases has been\n\nproperly estimated.\n\nIn theory, the alternative prior distribution provides a mechanism that avoids the\n\nestimation of spurious energy in the frequency and direction range close to the cancellation\n\npoints. The reliability of this approach has been assessed by the improvement of the\n\nestimations of the directional energy spreading for sea conditions with mean periods above\n\nto 12.7s. A detailed discussion about the estimations of the directional energy spectra is\n\nprovided in the following (see Figs. 5.39 and 5.40). However, its effectiveness is limited by\n\nthe fact that the heave, roll and pitch RAOs present several cancellation points in the high\n\nfrequency range. It should be emphasized that although the alternative prior distribution\n\naims at taking into account the uncertainties close to the zero points of the RAOs, large\n\ndiscrepancies between the measurements and the expected values of the motions may lead\n\nto the misleading estimation of the energy spectrum in certain frequency ranges linked to\n\nseveral cancellation points (from heave, roll and pitch).\n\nTable 5.7 shows the mean value of the ratios presented in figures from 5.31 to 5.36. In\n\nthis case the values are sorted according to the measured wave period of the first realization\n\nof the sea conditions. First, by inspecting the error statistics, it can be concluded that\n\ngood agreement with the expected values is obtained in both cases. Nonetheless, as it\n\nhas been pointed out before, the alternative prior distribution provides an improvement\n\nin the estimations obtained for the mean wave period. Regarding the estimations of\n\nthe significant wave height and the mean wave direction, it can be stated that even\n\nthough analogous results have been obtained in both cases, it is expected to obtain more\n\naccurate estimations with the alternative prior distribution for sea conditions with mean\n\nwave periods up to 11s.\n\nFigures 5.39 and 5.40 show a comparison between the measured directional sea spec-\n\ntrum and the estimations, obtained by means of the two different approaches, the con-\n\nventional approach and the Bayesian inference based on the alternative prior distribution.\n\nThe examples selected comprise one moderate sea condition, one mild sea condition and\n\n\n\n148\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.033 0.058 0.083 0.108 0.133 0.158 0.183\n\nW\na\n\nve\n S\n\np\ne\n\nct\nra\n\nl D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\n\nm\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\nTheoretical\nMeasured\nAlternative\nConventional\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.033 0.058 0.083 0.108 0.133 0.158 0.183\n\nW\na\n\nve\n S\n\np\ne\n\nct\nra\n\nl D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\n\nm\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\nTheoretical\nMeasured\nAlternative\nConventional\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.033 0.058 0.083 0.108 0.133 0.158 0.183\n\nW\na\n\nve\n S\n\np\ne\n\nct\nra\n\nl D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\n\nm\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\nTheoretical\nMeasured\nAlternative\nConventional\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.033 0.058 0.083 0.108 0.133 0.158 0.183\n\nW\na\n\nve\n S\n\np\ne\n\nct\nra\n\nl D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\n\nm\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\nTheoretical\nMeasured\nAlternative\nConventional\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.033 0.058 0.083 0.108 0.133 0.158 0.183\n\nW\na\n\nve\n S\n\np\ne\n\nct\nra\n\nl D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\n\nm\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\nTheoretical\nMeasured\nAlternative\nConventional\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.033 0.058 0.083 0.108 0.133 0.158 0.183\n\nW\na\n\nve\n S\n\np\ne\n\nct\nra\n\nl D\ne\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\n\nm\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\nTheoretical\nMeasured\nAlternative\nConventional\n\nFigure 5.37: Expected energy distribution in frequency-domain for sea conditions: 6, 12,\n15, 17, 30 and 31 (from left-to-right then top-to-bottom).

This can be linked to the fact\n\nthat the alternative prior distribution no longer imposes the smoothness conditions as\n\na necessary requirement of the solution, something that also leads to minor misleading\n\nestimation of the energy distribution in the direction. In any case, this drawback does\n\nnot affect the energy distribution in the frequency-domain (see Figs. 5.37 and 5.38). Once\n\nagain, it is important to remember that the long crested waves stand as a limiting condi-\n\n\n\n151\n\ntion for the conventional approach, since it assumes an smooth distribution in the energy\n\ndomain. Therefore, one may realize the relevance of the assessment regarding the perfor-\n\nmance of the methodologies adopted in this work by means of sea conditions generated\n\n(or measured) with a certain degree of spreading, something that has been left for future\n\nwork.\n\nBy inspecting these figures it can be concluded that the alternative approach, in\n\ngeneral, provides solutions with narrow spread of the energy in the direction. However,\n\nthe use of the smoothness only as a weak condition, in the alternative prior distribution,\n\nmay generate non-smooth solutions quartering seas. Another trend that can be identified\n\nis that spreading of the solutions obtained by means of both approaches are larger for\n\nextreme sea states than mild/calm sea states. This is due to the influence of the zero point\n\nthat the heave RAO presents close to 22s. It is worth to remember that the alternative\n\napproach provides estimations characterized by a smaller spreading than the ones obtained\n\nthrough the conventional approach.\n\nTo sum up, it can be concluded that the alternative prior distribution brings some\n\nimprovements if compared with the conventional approach. For instance, the alternative\n\napproach seems to provide more accurate estimations of sea conditions characterized by\n\nlow mean wave periods. Similarly, the spreading of the energy in direction is narrower\n\nwhen the sea state is estimated by means of the alternative approach than if it is inferred\n\nusing the conventional prior distribution. Nonetheless, the variance of the results, with\n\nregards to the different heading conditions, is increased when they are estimated though\n\nthe alternative prior distribution.\n\nFinally, another advantage obtained with the alternative prior distribution is the re-\n\nduction of the computing time. As it has been pointed before, the computations were\n\ncarried out with a desktop personal computer using MATLABr2014a. In average, the\n\nsoftware took 28s. to estimate one sea condition using the conventional approach, without\n\ntaking into account the time spent during pre-calibration procedure of the hyperparam-\n\neters. This mean time is reduced to only 6.7s when the alternative prior distribution is\n\nadopted.

The analysis performed was based on the\n\nresults obtained through an extensive model-scale experimental campaign carried out at\n\nthe USP\u2019s wave basin (TPN-USP), using a (1 : 120) scale model.\n\nIn accordance with the objectives of this thesis, the following tasks have been fulfilled\n\nand subsequent conclusions drawn:\n\n1. A systematical analysis of the dynamics of the semisubmersible platform has been\n\ncarried out, including a detailed assessment regarding the main hypothesis adopted\n\nto model the sea wave conditions as well as to linearize the platform wave responses.\n\nMoreover, the VMB Bayesian wave inference with three hyperparameters, as pro-\n\nposed in (SIMOS et al., 2012), has been adopted in order to evaluate the reliability\n\nof the platform as a VMB wave sensor.\n\n\u2022 The dynamics of the motions of the platform has been analyzed numerically\n\nin time-domain and in frequency-domain, showing that the platform presents\n\ngood (linear) response characteristics for being used as a wave sensor, partic-\n\nularly for periods below 20s.\n\n\u2022 Since the sea conditions tested at the wave basin range from calm/mild con-\n\nditions to 100yr-return events, they allowed a comprehensive assessment of\n\nthe semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor in calm and extreme sea\n\nstates.\n\n\u2022 The analysis carried out by means of the coherence functions has shown that\n\nthe heave-roll-pitch basis is the most appropriate for inferring the sea states\n\nusing the semisubmersible platform.\n\n\n\n155\n\n\u2022 Results obtained adopting this approach revealed that all the wave conditions\n\ntested could be accurately inferred from the Bayesian method, keeping the\n\nerrors within reasonable limits. On the one hand, the errors were larger in the\n\nmost unfavorable conditions, which correspond to the ones with small motions\n\n(small periods or mild seas) and in the cases when the sea only excited two\n\nof the three motions (bow and beam waves). Thus, the wave height and the\n\nmean wave period were estimated with errors always below 18% and 15% for\n\nthe most unfavorable heading conditions, respectively. Regarding the mean\n\nwave direction the results shown that it can be estimated with an error lower\n\nthan 3deg.\n\n\u2022 The errors are reduced in the cases were the platform presents larger motions, or\n\nthe existing ones provide more information, which are given when the heading\n\nis close to 135? and for the more severe wave conditions (when the wave induce\n\nmore pronounced motions). The errors for the most favorable conditions are\n\n0.05%, 1.3% and 0.6deg., for the estimations concerning the significant wave\n\nheight, mean wave period and mean direction, respectively. All the results\n\nconfirmed the expected biases of overestimating the wave period while under-\n\nestimating the wave height, deviations that are progressively smaller as the\n\nwave period increases and leading to better estimation regarding the extreme\n\nsea conditions.\n\n2. A detailed discussion regarding the prior distribution introduced by different authors\n\nhas been provided. The main differences between them and how they are related\n\nto each other have been also addressed in the analysis provided. The conclusions\n\ndrawn are:\n\n\u2022 The Bayesian learning methodology adopted, see (TANNURI et al., 2003), to\n\nassess the reliability of using the measured motions of the platform to esti-\n\nmate sea conditions, has provided results that show good agreement with the\n\nmeasurements obtained by means of conventional waves probes. However, the\n\nsemisubmersible platform was tested under carefully controlled experimental\n\nconditions, reducing the uncertainties of the linear model. In fact, other works\n\ndeveloped using the same inference technique, based on the measured motions\n\n\n\n156\n\nof a FPSO, e.g. (BISPO, 2011a), have pointed out misleading estimations\n\nunder certain sea conditions.\n\n\u2022 In principle, the inference results can be improved by means of simple modi-\n\nfications of the prior distributions adopted. In fact, an alternative prior dis-\n\ntribution has been developed, aiming to account for the possible drawbacks of\n\nthe current approach.\n\n\u2022 The comparison between the outputs obtained with the conventional approach\n\n(TANNURI et al., 2003) and the ones resulting from the inference method\n\nbased on the alternative prior distribution has shown that the adoption of\n\nthe later may lead to significant improvements. In fact, the error associated\n\nwith the estimation of the mean wave period has been reduced in general by\n\na factor equal to 5%. Similarly, the estimation of the wave height revealed an\n\nimprovement of the order of 3% regarding the mean error of the estimations,\n\nalthough it presents an increment of the error variability concerning different\n\nheadings.\n\n\u2022 An aspect of the alternative prior distribution that needs to be reviewed is that\n\nfor certain heading conditions (120?, 135? and 150?), the estimations result in\n\nnon-smooth patterns of the sea spectra. Concerning the relative errors of the\n\nestimations of the statistical parameters of the sea, it can be stated that they\n\nremained almost unchanged. The resulting unsmoothed pattern of the sea\n\nspectrum for these headings may be related to the fact that the smoothness\n\nconditions, adopted in the alternative prior distribution, act only as a weak\n\nrestriction.\n\n3. An assessment regarding the non-linearities close to the heave resonance has been\n\ncarried out by means of numerical analysis in frequency-domain and time-domain.\n\n\u2022 Non-linear heave responses were identified close the resonance frequency, that\n\nis within the frequency range of interest. Regarding the roll and pitch motions,\n\ntheir resonances are equal to 74s and 88s. Therefore, for the purposes of this\n\nwork the platform is expected to respond linearly in roll and pitch.\n\n\u2022 It is already known that the main source of non-linearities close to the reso-\n\nnances arise from drag effects. As a matter of fact, the viscous damping of the\n\n\n\n157\n\nheave motions is mainly governed by separation effects of the pontoons.\n\n\u2022 In order to properly model the responses of the heave motion, a simple linear\n\ndamping model has been proposed to take account of the non-liner resonant\n\nresponses, which indeed showed a good agreement with the decay tests carried\n\nout in still water.\n\n4. The results for more severe sea states are promising, even when the RAOs are\n\nmodelled in a conventional linear analysis in frequency-domain. Furthermore, the\n\nadoption of the alternative prior distribution seems to provide promising improve-\n\nments of the estimations of the sea conditions. Also, this prior distribution does\n\nnot need previous calibration of the hyperparameters (avoiding the use of numeri-\n\ncal simulations or a dedicated experimental campaign). This property, along with\n\nthe fact that the computational time is reduced, leads to a less time-consuming\n\nmethodology.\n\n\u2022 It may perhaps be observed that the results with the RAOs obtained from\n\ndifferent approaches also highlighted the importance of a proper modelling of\n\nthe transfer functions of motion.\n\n\u2022 In the experimental setup, a soft mooring system was used and the major source\n\nof drag was the platform itself. In this condition, the results obtained when\n\nusing the variable external damping method (a damping ratio proportional to\n\nthe recorded heave amplitude in each test) proved to be a good option for\n\ndealing with effects of the non-linear viscous damping.\n\n\u2022 Other possible effects due to the environmental conditions, such as wind and\n\ncurrents, or the submerged lines, must be properly assessed by means of a\n\ndedicated experimental campaign.\n\n\u2022 Another characteristic that may have a relevant influence on the accuracy of\n\nthe estimations is the spreading of the sea. During experimental campaign\n\nonly long crested sea conditions were tested, which provides a preliminary\n\nassessment of the reliability of the semisubmersible as a VMB wave inference\n\nsensor. Long crested seas, however, stand as a limiting case for the conventional\n\napproach and the use of sea states with spreading in direction may result in\n\nthe improvement of the estimations.\n\n\n\n158\n\n\u2022 The results obtained also attest that the semisubmersible platforms, although it\n\nis characterized by small motion amplitudes, it responds linearly in a wide range\n\nof sea conditions. Furthermore, it is known that in the operating condition\n\nthese platforms does not present variations of their metacentric height and\n\ndraft, which facilitates the estimations of the most appropriate set of RAOs\n\nused to infer the sea conditions.\n\nAs a general conclusion, one may state that the results obtained with the small-scale\n\ntests indicate that semisubmersible platform indeed may be considered as a good choice for\n\nthe VMB wave inference. Finally, since the semisubmersible platform can provide reliable\n\naccount of the sea conditions that imposed the measurement motions, in wide range of\n\nfrequencies, they can be adopted to complement the wave buoys network installed along\n\nthe Brazilian coast. Figure 6.1 presents the resulting wave monitoring network if Fig. 1.5\n\nis updated including only the semisubmersible platforms operated by Petrobras (in dark\n\nblue), illustrating the improvement of the monitoring network.\n\nFigure 6.1: Wave buoys and semisubmersible offshore paltforms stations in the Santos,\nCampos and Esp??to Santo basins. Information from (GOOS-BRASIL, 2018), (NOAA,\n2018) and (PETROBRAS, 2018).\n\n\n\n159\n\n6.1 Major findings\n\nThis thesis aims at researching the VMB wave inference method using the motions of\n\na semisubmersible platform. The major contributions obtained during the development\n\nof this work can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 When estimating the wave conditions based on the measured motions of a small-\n\nscale model of a semisubmersible platform, the results obtained show that semisub-\n\nmersible platforms may be considered as a good choice for the VMB wave inference.\n\nIn fact, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the platform (high natural periods)\n\nincrease the reliability of the model adopted. Therefore, for large semisubmersible\n\nplatforms, the interval of estimation may be more restricted in the high frequency\n\nrange. Generally, the accuracy of the estimations is improved as the wave period\n\nincreases, which is a benefit to the semisubmersible as a VMB wave sensor consid-\n\nering the more severe wave scenarios expected where these platforms are usually\n\ndeveloped.\n\n\u2022 Non-linear effects should be included in the excitation-response model of the plat-\n\nform to increase the accuracy of the estimations, especially in sea conditions charac-\n\nterized by large peaks periods that have energy close to the heave resonance. From\n\nthe Morison quadratic drag equation a linear damping estimation has been proposed.\n\nThis methodology aims to provide a simple approach to estimate the non-linear drag\n\neffects acting on the heave motion of a semisubmersible platform. The estimations\n\nobtained through this model show good agreement with the experimental data from\n\nthe heave decay tests.\n\n\u2022 The Bayesian VMB wave inference method as adopted by Tannuri et al. (2003) pro-\n\nvided good estimations when compared with the experimental measurements carried\n\nout at the wave basin by means of wave probes. However, this inference model must\n\nbe pre-calibrated, procedure that may involve numerical simulations as well as ex-\n\nperimental measurements. Furthermore, in some specific conditions previous works\n\nhave identified some limitations. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, an alter-\n\nnative prior distribution is provided in this thesis. The results obtained through\n\nthis prior distribution are in agreement with the experimental measurements and in\n\n\n\n160\n\nsome frequency ranges outperform the estimations obtained by means of the con-\n\nventional approach. Another important advantage obtained with this alternative\n\napproach is the reduction of the computing time to estimate the sea conditions.\n\nSumming up, the main contributions of this thesis are the assessment of the use of\n\na large semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor and the development of an\n\nalternative prior distribution. It is shown that the prior knowledge of the variance of\n\neach element of the unknown spectrum can be estimated through the measured mo-\n\ntions. An extensive analysis of analytical, numerical and small-scale experimental\n\ndata has been carried out. Finally, this thesis also provides a systematic discussion\n\nregarding the characteristics of the sea states generated at the wave basin (Gaus-\n\nsianity, Stationarity and the optimal run length) as well as the boundary conditions\n\nadopted in the Bayesian approach to estimate the sea states.\n\n6.2 Future work\n\nNaturally, a substantial amount of possible future work threads arise from the topics\n\ndiscussed in this thesis. From these, the following tasks are considered the more relevant\n\nto properly addressing during future stages of this research:\n\n\u2022 The relevance of a more refined experimental analysis of the effects the moorings\n\nand risers may have on the motions of the unit is envisaged, and the same is true\n\nregarding the action of wind and current. Furthermore, the use of the full-scale\n\ndata to make wave inference will be useful to understand the real effects that the\n\nmoorings lines and risers may have on the motions of the semisubmersible platform.\n\n\u2022 Regarding the use of full-scale data, it may also be useful to fully assess the reliability\n\nof the semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave inference wave sensor. The results\n\nobtained through the experimental campaign carried out in the wave basin attested\n\nthat the method was capable of capturing very well all the wave conditions tested.\n\nHowever, full-scale data may bring challenges that are different to the ones that\n\nwere overcome in this thesis.\n\nFollowing the procedure adopted in (BISPO, 2011b) to validate the use of a FPSO\n\nas VMB wave sensor, it can be advised to adopt a minimum time span equal to\n\n\n\n161\n\n24 months of full-scale data. This approach would allow to take into consideration\n\nthe seasonal variability of the sea conditions (including Hs, Tp and ?) when the\n\nassessment of the use of a semisubmersible platform is carried out.\n\n\u2022 The A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform is characterized by large resonant periods\n\nfor the roll and pitch motions. However, this is not the general standard for the all\n\nsemisubmersible platform, which usually present lower natural periods for pitch and\n\nroll motions (slightly above to 30s). Since one the objectives is the expansion of the\n\nwave buoys monitoring network in the Brazilian coast, it is important to carry out\n\nsome tests with geometries for the semisubmersible platform operated by Petrobras,\n\nsuch as P-18, P-20, P-51 and P-52.\n\n\u2022 Regarding the alternative prior distribution, there are still some problems with the\n\nsmoothness of the outputs. In fact, for bow sea conditions the estimated directional\n\nwave spectrum in some cases is characterized by a noisy pattern. The adoption\n\nof smoothing functions, based on the estimated energy distribution, may provide a\n\nsuitable solution for this shortcoming.\n\n\u2022 It has been shown that the uncertainty introduced by the cancellation points of the\n\nRAOs may generate misleading estimations of the sea conditions. The alternative\n\nprior distribution proposed in this work provides a proper mechanism to avoid spu-\n\nrious energy estimations near the cancellation points. However, it would be useful\n\nto properly study if the linear approach adopted to estimate the prior distribution\n\n(see Eq. 4.40) is the one that leads the best estimations.\n\n\u2022 The boundary conditions adopted to compute the prior distribution have been dis-\n\ncussed in appendix E. Moreover, it was shown that some of these conditions can\n\nbe modified to mitigate some drawbacks identified by other authors when a FPSO\n\nis adopted as a VMB wave sensor (see Bispo et al. (2016)), such as the tendency\n\nof the method of locating spurious energy peaks at the bow and stern of the vessel\n\nin beam sea conditions. Due to the fact that the estimations obtained during this\n\nresearch do not show the limitations identified by Bispo et al. (2016), an assessment\n\nregarding the possible improvements provided by the changes proposed for the prior\n\ndistribution has been left as a future work.\n\n\n\n162\n\n\u2022 This thesis is based on an extensive analysis of the results obtained using two differ-\n\nent approaches for the Bayesian inference. In both cases good agreement with the\n\nmeasurements is obtained, showing that a semisubmersible platform can be used\n\nas a proper VMB wave sensor. However, it would be interesting to determine the\n\nstatistical significance of these results, or in other words, what are the chances of\n\nobtaining the same results if a similar model-scale experimental campaign is car-\n\nried out again? The most common approach adopted to answer this question is\n\nto generate large amounts of data through an experimental campaign. However,\n\nthis approach is likely to result in an expensive research campaign and in some\n\ncases the results drawn may be inconclusive. In fact, large amounts of data tend\n\nto normalize biases, specially when they do not properly represent the majority of\n\nthe population of interest (in this case the semisubmersible platforms). For these\n\nreasons, it is proposed as a future work the evaluation of the statistical significance\n\nof the results by means of alternative statistical techniques, such as the Bayesian\n\nfactors. By adopting this approach, the main challenge to be faced would be to\n\nproperly estimate the marginal distribution of measuring the data obtained from\n\nthe measured motions of the platform, P(B).\n\n\u2022 Finally, another line of future work is the use of semisubmersible wind turbine\n\nplatforms as a base for the VMB wave inference. As a matter of fact, these platforms\n\nstand a popular technology as an offshore wind turbine foundation and they usually\n\nare carefully monitored. Although the dynamics of these platforms is similar to\n\nthe one presented by conventional O&amp;G conventional semisubmersible platforms, a\n\ndedicated experimental campaign is needed to properly assess the effects that the\n\naerodynamic wind forces may have on the platform motions.\n\n\n\n163\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAKAIKE, H.

When modeling ocean wave trains,\n\nit is commonly assumed that ? has a constant density thus implying that all phase shift\n\nvalues have the same probability of occurrence (LONGUET-HIGGINS, 1957).\n\nAccordingly, the probability distribution of the phase shift (see Eq. (3.13)) can be\n\nwritten as,\n\nP(? &lt;? &lt;? + d?) = pdf(?)d? =\n1\n\n2?\nd?, (A.1)\n\nobtaining that,\n\n? +?\n??\n\npdf(?)d? =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n1\n\n2?\nd? = 1 . (A.2)\n\nSame instantaneous value of the sinusoidal wave can be obtained using two different\n\nphases. In other words, for a same time instant two different phase shifts can provide\n\nthe same instantaneous value. From this property, the probability density function of the\n\nwave elevation is given by,\n\npdf(?)d? = P(? = ?) = P(? = ?1) + P(? = ?2) = 2pdf(?)d? =\nd?\n\n?\n. (A.3)\n\nThis is an important relation that allows the following variable change (considering\n\nthe fact that the probability density function should be always positive),\n\n\n\n172\n\npdf(?) = pdf(?)\n\n????d?d?\n???? = 1?\n\n????d?d?\n???? , (A.4)\n\nThus, d? should be determined in order to estimate the probability density function\n\nof the amplitude of the wave. Thus simplifying Eq. (3.13) for an unidirectional wave and\n\ndifferentiating,\n\nd? = ?A sin(kx?? t + ?)d?, (A.5)\n\nrelation that should be replaced in Eq. (A.6), leading to the expression of the probability\n\ndensity function of the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave,\n\npdf(?) =\n1\n\n? (A2 ??2)\n1\n2\n\n. (A.6)\n\nNow, by means of the expression provided in Eq. (A.6), the statistical characteristics\n\nof the process can be computed as follows. In the first place, the mean value is given by,\n\nE[?(x,t)] =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n? pdf(?)d? =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n?\n\n? (A2 ??2)\n1\n2\n\nd? = 0 . (A.7)\n\nThis result shows that the process is independent of the time and space (GODA,\n\n2000). Secondly, the mean square can be computed as,\n\nE[?2(x,t)] =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n?2 pdf(?)d? =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n?2\n\n? (A2 ??2)\n1\n2\n\nd? =\na2\n\n2\n. (A.8)\n\nrelation that shows that the mean square does not depend of the space and time. In\n\nthe third place, the autocorrelation function is defined by the expression provided in\n\nEq. (A.9). For this purpose, assume that the random process under study produces\n\ntwo random variables ?(x1, t1) and ?(x2, t2) at times an positions (x1, t1) and (x2, t2),\n\nrespectively (A?STRO?M, 2012).\n\n\n\n173\n\nR?? := R??(x1, t1; x2, t2) = E[?(x1, t1)?(x2, t2)] =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n?1?2pdf?(x1,t1)?(x2,t2)(?1,?2)d?1d?2 ,\n\n(A.9)\n\nThe resulting relation, after some algebra, can be rewritten as,\n\nR?? = E\n\n[\nA2\n\n2\n(cos(k(x1 + x2) ??(t1 + t2) + 2?) + cos(k(x1 ?x2) ??(t1 ? t2)))\n\n]\n,\n\n(A.10)\n\nand using the following definitions ?? = x1?x2, ? = t1?t2, x3 = x1 +x2 and t3 = t1 +t2,\n\nthe autocorrelation function will be,\n\nR?? =\nA2\n\n2\nE [(cos(kx3 ?? t3 + 2?) + a cos(k?????))] . (A.11)\n\nAnother important property of the sinusoidal wave is that the mean value over one\n\ncomplete cycle is zero. This feature allows the simplification of the previous equation,\n\nbeing reduced to,\n\nR?? =\nA2\n\n2\ncos(k?????) . (A.12)\n\nEquation A.12 shows that autocorrelation function is independent of the time and\n\nspace and, as a consequence, it only depends on the relative values of the time and position\n\nwith respect to a certain reference. Also, it has been shown that the sinusoidal wave is\n\na stationary process regarding its mean value, the mean square and the autocorrelation\n\nfunction. Therefore, the process can be assumed ergodic.\n\nFinally, another example is provided for illustration purposes. Let be ?(x,t) a random\n\nprocess that is given as the sum of two independent sinusoidal waves,\n\n?1(x,t) = A1 cos(k1x??1 t + ?1) ,\n\n?2(x,t) = A2 cos(k2x??2 t + ?2) ,\n(A.13)\n\nThus,\n\n\n\n174\n\n?(x,t) = A1 cos(k1x??1 t + ?1) + A2 cos(k2x??2 t + ?2) , (A.14)\n\nLeading to the mean value,\n\nE[?(x,t)] = E[?1(x,t) + ?2(x,t)] = E[?1(x,t)] + E[?2(x,t)] = 0 + 0 = 0 . (A.15)\n\nAccordingly, the mean square is computed as follows,\n\nE[?2(x,t)] = E[(?1(x,t) + ?2(x,t))\n2\n] =\n\nE[?21 (x,t)] + E[?\n2\n2 (x,t)] + 2E[?1(x,t)?2(x,t)] ,\n\n(A.16)\n\nIf both process are independent, the resulting covariance must be zero (E[?1(x,t)?2(x,t)] =\n\n0), also, as it has been shown before, the mean value of the process over one period is\n\nequal to zero. As a consequence, the Eq. (A.16) is reduced to,\n\nE[?2(x,t)] =\nA21\n2\n\n+\nA22\n2\n. (A.17)\n\nAccordingly, the autocorrelation function can be reduced to the following expression,\n\nR?? = R??(x1, t1; x2, t2) = E[?(x1, t1)?(x2, t2)] =\n\nR11 + R22 + R12 = R11 + R22 ,\n(A.18)\n\nFinally, this process presents the same characteristics regarding the mean value, the\n\nmean square and the autocorrelation function as the sinusoidal wave, i.e. the process\n\nis stationary and homogeneous and it can be assumed ergodic. In this context ergodic\n\nmeans that the number of the cosine waves included in the analysis is sufficiently large.\n\nThe foregoing results present a basic illustration of the main fundamentals that allow\n\nthe characterization of the sea surface elevation using the statistical approach. Further-\n\nmore, an interesting result of this approach arises when infinite waves components are\n\nincluded, thus the well-known Longuet-Higgins model (see eq. (3.13)) is obtained.\n\n\n\n175\n\nAPPENDIX B \u2013 STATISTICAL\n\nDESCRIPTION OF\n\nWAVES\n\nA brief discussion regarding key concepts of the probabilistic description of the sea is\n\nincluded herein. Therefore, conditions concerning the Gaussianity, Ergodicity, Stationar-\n\nity and optimal sample time of the process are reviewed.\n\nB.1 Gaussianity\n\nIn the Longuet-Higgins random sea model, the sea surface profile is obtained as a\n\nresult of the sum of infinity sinusoidal wave components (LONGUET-HIGGINS, 1957).\n\nExamination of the resulting amplitudes of this model reveals that this process can be\n\nassumed stationary Gaussian, as a direct consequence of the central limit theorem. On\n\nthe other hand, it is common to assume the narrow banded spectrum hypothesis, in order\n\nto assure that there is a very small probability that the maxima of the irregular wave\n\nprofile are located elsewhere than at the wave crests. Accordingly, the amplitude of the\n\nwave components gives the amplitude of the wave envelope. Nonetheless, Longuet-Higgins\n\n(1957) shows that for a Gaussian process, the envelope of an irregular wave profile can\n\nalways be defined, even if the spectrum is not narrow.\n\nAnother remark should be done regarding narrow banded processes, as it is the result-\n\ning sea of the Longuet-Higgins random sea model. This kind of processes has an important\n\nrelationship with the Rayleigh distribution, which describes the probability distribution\n\nof the the envelope of the random data series. The Rayleigh probability distribution can\n\nbe derived from the Gaussian distribution, as it shown in (BENDAT; PIERSOL, 2010). A\n\ndirect consequence of the use of the Rayleigh distribution to describe the envelope of the\n\n\n\n176\n\nirregular wave profile is that important information about the statistical characteristics of\n\nthe sea spectrum can be derived from this distribution, as it has been shown in chapter 3.\n\nConcerning the effectiveness of the Gaussianity assumption, chapter 4 provides a\n\ndetailed review about the Gaussian characteristics of the wave elevation and the im-\n\nplications on the Bayesian inference approach. This analysis shows that it is expected\n\nthat the Guassianity assumption will be no longer valid for processes that are highly\n\nnon-stationary or/and when the non-linear terms of the hydrodynamic equations become\n\nsignificant. Furthermore, when irregular sea conditions are generated artificially by means\n\nof numerical simulations or in controlled conditions, such as wave basins, the relation be-\n\ntween different sinusoidal wave components of the Longet-Higgins model may lead to a\n\nnon-gaussian process, see (TUCKER; CHALLENOR; CARTER, 1984). However, the\n\nGaussianity assumption leads to very attractive simplifications from a practical point of\n\nview, and, as a consequence, the Gaussianity hypothesis is commonly adopted even for\n\nnon-linear processes.\n\nIn order to illustrate these points Fig. B.1 and Fig. B.2 provide the empirical distri-\n\nbution of the surface elevation for two different sea conditions tested in the wave basin (a\n\ndetailed description of all conditions tested during the experimental campaign is provided\n\nin chapter 5). The sea conditions selected for this analysis correspond to: The first sea\n\ncondition, with Tp = 9.5s and Hs = 3.5m (mild sea state), and the most extreme sea\n\ncondition, with Tp = 19.5s and Hs = 16.4m (once in 100 years). Both sea conditions were\n\nobtained using a JONSWAP spectrum. Sea states generated by means of a Torsethaugen\n\nspectrum are assumed not proper for this analysis because their spectrum band is larger\n\nthan the equivalent JONSWAP spectrum and, as a consequence, the expected deviation\n\nfrom the Gaussian distribution could be larger. The test conditions analyzed here indicate\n\nsome discrepancies of the surface elevation from the normal distribution. Also, in order to\n\nprovide some statistical framework, various parametric distributions have been adjusted\n\nto the empirical data and included in these figures, i.e.: Normal (gaussian), GEV (Gen-\n\neralized Extreme Values), Logistic and Tlocationscale distributions, that are extensively\n\ndocumented in the literature.\n\nThe probability distributions shown in Fig. B.1 and Fig. B.2 provide a general idea\n\nregarding the main differences between the empirical distribution and the adjusted normal\n\n\n\n177\n\n2/2\nrms\n\n-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\nili\n\nty\n D\n\ne\nn\nsi\n\nty\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\nMmpirical\nNormal\nGEV\nLogistic\nTlocationscale\n\nFigure B.1: Distribution of the surface for the first sea condition.\n\n2/2\nrms\n\n-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\nili\n\nty\n D\n\ne\nn\nsi\n\nty\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\nEmpirical\nNormal\nGEV\nLogistic\nTlocationscale\n\nFigure B.2: Distribution of the surface for the once in 100 years sea condition.\n\ndistribution. However, a quantitative analysis is needed in order to evaluate the validity of\n\nthe Gaussianity assumption regarding the sea conditions generated in the wave basin. For\n\n\n\n178\n\nthis purpose (BULMER, 2012) suggests the evaluation of the skewness, which provides a\n\nmeasurement of the asymmetry of the measured probability distribution.\n\nConcerning the normal distribution, it is characterized by having an skewness equal\n\nto zero, which implies that the data is perfectly symmetric, but this value of the skewness\n\nis highly unusual for empirical data. Therefore, the classification proposed in (BULMER,\n\n2012) will be adopted to determine if a the distribution can be assumed symmetric and\n\nconsequently Gaussian. The criterion adopted sates that:\n\n\u2022 If the skewness is less than ?1 or greater than +1, the distribution is assumed as\n\nhighly skewed;\n\n\u2022 If the value of the skewness is between ?1 and ?0.5 or between +0.5 and +1, the\n\nestimated distribution will be assumed moderately skewed;\n\n\u2022 If the skewness is between ?0.5 and +0.5, the measured distribution can be assumed\n\napproximately symmetric.\n\nThe values of the estimated skewness of the measured wave elevation for all the sea\n\nconditions tested in the wave basin are provided in Tab. B.1. These results show that all\n\nthe sea conditions tested in the wave basin present skewness values between 0.2 and 0.49.\n\nTherefore, the distributions can be assumed approximately symmetric and, consequently,\n\nthe Gaussianity assumption will be adopted for all the sea conditions tested. Also, it\n\nis interesting to remark that the positive value of the skewness, obtained for all the sea\n\nconditions, suggests that the wave crest heights are larger than the wave trough depths.\n\nB.2 Ergodicity\n\nAn ensemble of wave profiles is assumed an ergodic process if a particular sample\n\nhas the property that its time averaged statistics are equal to those of the ensemble\n\naverage. Therefore, the assumption of ergodicity allows a theoretically correct substitution\n\nof ensemble averaging by temporal average (BENDAT; PIERSOL, 2010). It is important\n\nto highlight that the hypothesis of ergodicity derives from the linear sea wave theory, as\n\nwell as the Gaussian hypothesis (see appendix A).\n\n\n\n179\n\nTable B.1: Estimated skewness for all the sea tests conditions.\n\nWave ID Sea Spectrum Skewness\nSTA-IRR-01 JONSWAP 0.31\nSTA-IRR-02 JONSWAP 0.21\nSTA-IRR-03 TORSETHAUGEN 0.25\nSTA-IRR-04 TORSETHAUGEN 0.22\nSTA-IRR-05 TORSETHAUGEN 0.28\nSTA-IRR-06 JONSWAP 0.33\nSTA-IRR-07 JONSWAP 0.23\nSTA-IRR-08 TORSETHAUGEN 0.27\nSTA-IRR-09 TORSETHAUGEN 0.49\nSTA-IRR-10 JONSWAP 0.33\nSTA-IRR-11 JONSWAP 0.24\nSTA-IRR-12 TORSETHAUGEN 0.33\nSTA-IRR-13 JONSWAP 0.33\nSTA-IRR-14 TORSETHAUGEN 0.39\nSTA-IRR-15 JONSWAP 0.46\nSTA-IRR-16 JONSWAP 0.33\nSTA-IRR-17 TORSETHAUGEN 0.38\nSTA-IRR-18 JONSWAP 0.44\nSTA-IRR-19 JONSWAP 0.49\nSTA-IRR-20 JONSWAP 0.36\nSTA-IRR-21 TORSETHAUGEN 0.38\nSTA-IRR-22 TORSETHAUGEN 0.32\nSTA-IRR-23 JONSWAP 0.40\nSTA-IRR-24 JONSWAP 0.48\nSTA-IRR-25 JONSWAP 0.38\nSTA-IRR-26 TORSETHAUGEN 0.39\nSTA-IRR-27 JONSWAP 0.46\nSTA-IRR-28 JONSWAP 0.40\nSTA-IRR-29 TORSETHAUGEN 0.42\nSTA-IRR-30 JONSWAP 0.46\nSTA-IRR-31 JONSWAP 0.40\nSTA-IRR-32 TORSETHAUGEN 0.45\n\nConsequently, if the sea surface elevation is an ergodic process, then all the joint pdfs\n\ncan be estimated from one single realization of the process having infinite time length.\n\nSo, a process is said to be ergodic if the statistics of a particular sample ?i(t) are equal\n\nto those of the ensemble average,\n\nE[?(t)] = ?i(t) = lim\nT??\n\n1\n\nT\n\n? T\n0\n\n?i(?)d? , (B.1)\n\n\n\n180\n\nE[?(t + ? t)?(t)] = ?i(t + ? t)?i(t) = lim\nT??\n\n1\n\nT\n\n? T\n0\n\n?i(? + ? t)?i(?)d? . (B.2)\n\nIt is seen from Eqs. (B.1) and (B.2) that an ergodic process must necessarily be\n\nstationary. If these equations hold for a Gaussian process, then all the joint distributions\n\ncan be obtained and the process will be fully determined. Finally, a stochastic process that\n\npossesses ergodicity is always a stationary process. However, the stationarity conditions\n\ndoes not imply ergodicity of the process.\n\nB.3 Stationarity\n\nAbove, the Gaussian and ergodic conditions of random sea waves have been reviewed.\n\nThis section aims at explaining the stationarity condition, which refers to the character-\n\nistic of a stochastic process in which all the statistic properties are time-invariant. For\n\nexample, if the stationary condition is applied to a certain register of wave elevation, then\n\nthe arithmetic mean and the autocorrelation function have the following properties:\n\nE[?(t)] = \u00b5? = E[?(0)] , with ?? &lt;t &lt;? , (B.3)\n\nE[?(t + ? t)?(t)] = R?? = E[?(?)?(0)] , with ?? &lt;t &lt;? . (B.4)\n\nB.4 Optimal sample time\n\nIn theory, the fulfillment of three conditions described above would be sufficient to\n\nselect the test duration in which a minimum number of relevant events is obtained. How-\n\never, from a practical point of view this is usually an unrealistic objective, because the\n\nwave elevation, even in a controlled experimental campaign at a wave basin, is in general\n\nnon-stationary. Also, a minimal number of cycles (or waves) is needed (ITTC, 2014) to\n\nobtain a statistical significance of the characteristics of the wave spectrum. The use of\n\nthe well-known Fast Fourier Transform procedure implies that the maximum time dura-\n\ntion is given by Tmax =\n1\n\n? f\n, where ? f is the frequency separation of the harmonics (see\n\n(CAMAS, 2016)). This is due to the fact that wave record repeats itself after this time.\n\n\n\n181\n\nAnother advantage that derives from the adoption of the Fast Fourier Transform is\n\nthat it allows the estimation of the standard error, ?2m, that a spectrum presents over the\n\nfrequency interval of interest (given by N harmonics in the frequency range [fm,fm+N?1]),\n\nin accordance with the sample time duration of the signal.\n\nIn order to deduce the value of the standard error, the random nature of the amplitude\n\nof each harmonic of a power spectrum (that has been introduced in section 3.2) should\n\nbe considered. In the analysis of a single record, the measured value of the power of a\n\ngiven harmonic component is given by s??i, and as a result of its randomness its value\n\nmay differ from one to another independent record of the same signal. Nonetheless, it is\n\npossible to adopt the average of the amplitude of a given harmonic, S??i, over many inde-\n\npendent records of the same signal as the truly characteristic amplitude of the harmonic\n\n(TUCKER, 1957).\n\nFor the jth realization, the average of the spectrum from the mth to the (m + N?1)th\n\nharmonic is (s??m + ... + s??m+N?1 )/N and the error is the amount that differs from the\n\naverage of the averaged values of the spectrum over many records (S??m +...+S??m+N?1 )/N.\n\nNow, the square of the error can be defined as,\n\n[\n(S??m ?s??m) + ... + (S??m+N?1 + s??m+N?1 )\n\n]\nN2\n\n=[?m+N?1\ni=m (S??i ?s??i) +\n\n?\nn 6= l(S??n ?s??n)(S??l ?s??l)\n\n]\nN2\n\n,\n\n(B.5)\n\nBy definitions the value computed as the average value of Eq. (B.5) over many analyses\n\nis the square of the standard error, ?. Tucker (1957) shows that the values of (S??n?s??n)\n\nand (S??l ?s??l) are unrelated and that their product averaged over many analyses tends\n\nto zero. Thus, the standard error can be defied as,\n\n?2 =\n\n?m+N?1\ni=m (S??i ?s??i)\n\nN2\n=\n\n?m+N?1\ni=m ?\n\n2\ni\n\nN2\n. (B.6)\n\nAssuming that all the values of the spectrum are equal over the frequency range of\n\ninterest all the values of ?2i and ?\n2 =\n\n?2i\n\nN\n. Now, from the relation between the variance\n\n\n\n182\n\nand the expected value of the spectrum in each frequency, obtained in section 3.2, the\n\nstandard error can be rewritten as,\n\n?2 =\nS2??i\n\nN\n. (B.7)\n\nThus, the proportional standard error\n?2\n\nS??i\n=\n\n1\n?\nN\n\n. As an illustration of the impor-\n\ntance of this relation, consider the analysis of a recorded signal characterized by bandwidth\n\nequivalent to 0.5Hz. If a 2.5% standard error is required, then the signal recorded must\n\nhave at least 1600 cycles, that is, the record must be 3200s.\n\nThis shows that the procedure provides an optimal solution regarding the time du-\n\nration of the recorded signal if the true power spectrum is uniform and narrowband.\n\nHowever, for different sea conditions it may present some problems. For example, con-\n\nsider the spectra provided in Fig. B.3. In this figure the Torsethaugen spectrum is named\n\nas TH and Measured provides the full-scale measured sea spectrum. In this case, if the\n\nrelations presented above are followed, the total time for the recorded signal will be the\n\nsame for both spectra: Torsethaugen and the measured. However, from the same figure,\n\nit can be observed that the expected mean wave period is different for these spectra.\n\nThus, if the same recording time is considered, the expected number of cycles (or waves)\n\nfor these sea conditions will be (sufficiently) different and, consequently, the statistical\n\nestimators will have distinct significance. Accordingly, a different procedure to determine\n\nthe time length of the signal is needed to obtain recordings that have the same statistical\n\nsignificance.\n\nThe main idea followed in this work, to determine the time duration of the register,\n\nis to estimate the variance of a temporal statistical estimator, such as the temporal mean\n\nor the temporal mean square of the wave elevation, and set the estimated variance of\n\nthe estimator less than or equal of a certain value, for all the sea conditions. Therefore,\n\nthe total recorded time for the tested sea conditions will be different in each case. In\n\norder to guarantee a minimum number of cycles, a minimum time span of 30 minutes is\n\nconsidered, that is typically assumed as the length of the stationary period (SOARES;\n\nFRICKE, 2011). Then, the variance of the estimator is obtained every minute until a\n\ncertain sample time is reached, where the computed variance of the estimator is less than\n\n\n\n183\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5\n\nS\np\ne\nct\n\nra\nl d\n\ne\nn\nsi\n\nty\n [\nm\n\n2\n/H\n\nz]\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\nTH\nMeasured\n\nFigure B.3: Illustration of different types of spectra.

The running mean and running mean square of a process, ?, are given by:\n\n??? =\n1\n\nt\n\n? t\n0\n\n?(?)d? , (B.8)\n\n??2? =\n1\n\nt\n\n? t\n0\n\n?2(?)d? . (B.9)\n\nIf the process under analysis, ?, is supposed weakly stationary, it has the following\n\nproperties:\n\nE[?] =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n? pdf(?)d? = \u00b5? , (B.10)\n\n\n\n184\n\nE[?2] =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n?2 pdf(?)d? = \u00b52? + ?\n2\n? , (B.11)\n\nE[?(t)?(t + ? t)] = R??(?) . (B.12)\n\nFrom Eqs. (B.8) and (B.9), the expected values of the running mean and the running\n\nmean square are:\n\nE[???] =\n1\n\nt\n\n? t\n0\n\nE[?(?)]d? = \u00b5? , (B.13)\n\nE[??2?] =\n1\n\nt\n\n? t\n0\n\nE[?2(?)]d? = \u00b5? + ?\n2\n? . (B.14)\n\nTherefore, the unbiased estimators, for the expected values of ? and ?2, are given by\n\nthe running mean and the running mean square. However, the main interest in this case\n\nis the degree of variation of these estimators over the time. Thus,\n\nVar(???) = E[???2] ?E2[???] =\n2\n\nt2\n\n? t\n0\n\n{? ?\n0\n\n(R??(?) ?\u00b52?)d?\n}\n\nd? =\n\n2\n\nt\n\n? t\n0\n\n(\n1 ?\n\n?\n\nt\n\n)(\nR??(?) ?\u00b52?\n\n)\nd? ,\n\n(B.15)\n\nAnd following a similar procedure,\n\nVar(??2?) = E[??2?2] ?E2[??2?] =\n2\n\nt2\n\n? t\n0\n\n{? ?\n0\n\n(R?2?2 (?) ? (?2? + \u00b5\n2\n?)\n\n2)d?\n\n}\nd? =\n\n2\n\nt\n\n? t\n0\n\n(\n1 ?\n\n?\n\nt\n\n)(\nR?2?2 (?) ? (?2? + \u00b5\n\n2\n?)\n\n2\n)\n\nd? ,\n\n(B.16)\n\nEqs. (B.15) and (B.16) provide general expression for any stationary process. In the\n\ncase of zero-mean Gaussian process (see Ochi (1990)), the expressions simplify to:\n\n\n\n185\n\nVar(???) =\n2\n\nt\n\n? t\n0\n\n(\n1 ?\n\n?\n\nt\n\n)\nR??(?)d? , (B.17)\n\nVar(??2?) = E[??2?2] ?E2[??2?] =\n4\n\nt\n\n? t\n0\n\n(\n(1 ?\n\n?\n\nt\n\n)\nR2??(?))d? . (B.18)\n\nConsequently, the time length of the signal will be determined when the variance\n\nselected as indicator from Eqs. (B.17) or (B.18), reaches a certain minimum value. This\n\nprocedure is expected to provide different time lengths of the recorded signal for the sea\n\nconditions tested, providing larger sampling times for test conditions that correspond to\n\nextreme sea states in the scatter diagram.\n\nThe procedure proposed above provides a proper methodology to determine the time\n\nduration of the recorded signal for sea conditions where the sea elevation is known, such\n\nas tests conducted in a wave basin. However, in full-scale applications only the measured\n\nmotions of a ship or platform are available. The problem is therefore: Is this procedure\n\nappropriate when it is applied to the ship motions?\n\nLet ?(t) be a realization of a certain sea condition in a time interval [0,T]. In order to\n\nproperly represent the motions induced in a floating vessel by this sea condition, let be ` a\n\nsufficiently smooth function of the value ? of the sea condition under study. On the other\n\nhand, ships and platforms usually behave themselves as a low-pass filters. Therefore, the\n\nrealization of the new process (which represents a certain response of the ship, such as\n\nthe heave motion) can be obtained as:\n\nzi(t) =\n1\n\n? t\n\n? t+? t\nt\n\n`(?(?))d? , (B.19)\n\nwhere t &lt;T and ? t is assumed sufficient to filter the high frequency component of the\n\nresulting process.\n\nThe expected value is estimated with Eq. (B.20), which is the result of making use\n\nof the definition of the expected value and the linearity of the operators involved in the\n\ncalculation.\n\n\n\n186\n\nE[z(t)] =\n1\n\n? t\n\n? t+? t\nt\n\nE[`(?(?))]d? , (B.20)\n\nwhere,\n\nE[`(?(?))] =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n`(?(?))f(?; ?)d? . (B.21)\n\nin this equation f stands for the probability density function of ?(?).\n\nWith regards to the autocorrelation function,\n\nRzz(t1, t2) = E[z(t1)z(t2)] =\n1\n\n? t1? t2\n\n? t1+? t1\nt1\n\n? t2+? t2\nt2\n\nE[`(?(?1))`(?(?2))]d?1d?2 ,\n\n(B.22)\n\nwhere,\n\nE[`(?(?1))`(?(?2))] =\n\n? +?\n??\n\n? +?\n??\n\n`(?1)`(?2)f(?1,?2; ?1,?2)d?1d?2 , (B.23)\n\nMore particularly,\n\nE[z2(t)] = Rzz(t, t) =\n1\n\n? t2\n\n? t+? t\n0\n\n? t+? t\n0\n\nE[`(?(?1))`(?(?2))]d?1d?2 . (B.24)\n\nConsequently, the variance is given by:\n\nVar(z(t)) = E[z2(t)] ?E2[z(t)] = Rzz(t) ?E[z2(t)] . (B.25)\n\nIt must be noted that, in general, even if the wave elevation is stationary, the induced\n\nmotion does not have stationarity with respect to the autocorrelation function, but it is\n\nstationary with respect to the expected value. Moreover, the autocorrelation function,\n\nR??(?), is equivalent to the power spectral density function, S??(?, k), by virtue of the the\n\nWiener-Kinchine theorem. Therefore, the resulting statistical properties of the motions\n\nspectra are not stationary.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, however, in some cases the measured motions may\n\n\n\n187\n\nprovide a good input of the procedure proposed to select the optimal sample time. In\n\nfact, it is expected that the uncertainty introduced by the non-stationarity of the motions\n\nwill be minimum in systems moored with a fixed heading relative to the seabed, because\n\nthe induced non-stationarity is reduced to the RAOs variation in frequency-domain and\n\nthe sea mean direction, limiting the possible wind and current effects on the heading of\n\nthe platform and, as consequence, on the non-stationarity of the motions. As a prelimi-\n\nnary evaluation of this procedure, the estimated sampling time will be obtained through\n\nthe measured heave motion of the semisubmersible platform employed during the exper-\n\nimental campaign. However, due to the limitations of the tests carried out in the wave\n\nbasin, full-scale applications of this method should be discussed more thoroughly with\n\nthe analysis of real data of the measured motions.\n\n\n\n188\n\nAPPENDIX C \u2013 STANDARD MODELS\n\nFOR WAVE SPECTRUM\n\nA detailed description of the wave spectrum models adopted in this work is provided\n\nin (BISHOP; PRICE, 1979) and (TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004). In the following\n\nthe main formulae of the JONSWAP wave spectrum and the Torsethaugen wave spectrum\n\nare addressed.\n\nJONSWAP wave spectrum\n\nThe JONSWAP wave spectrum was derived from the analysis of the data collected\n\nduring the Joint North Sea Wave Observation Project (JONSWAP) and it can be con-\n\nsidered an improvement of the PM wave spectrum. The expression for this type of wave\n\nspectrum is defined by,\n\nS??(f) = 0.3125 H\n2\ns T\n\n2\np f\n?5 exp\n\n{\n?1.25 T?4p f\n\n?4} (1 ? 0.287 ln ?) ?(exp{?0.5(Tpf?1? )2}) ,\n(C.1)\n\nwhere the parameter, ?, is a measure of the width of the spectral peak and can be written\n\nas,\n\n???\n??\n? = 0.07, for Tp f &lt;1\n\n? = 0.09, for Tp f ? 1 ,\n(C.2)\n\nand ? stands as the peakedness of the spectrum relative to a fully developed spectrum.\n\nAs a matter of fact, when ? is equal to one, JONSWAP spectrum equals to the PM\n\nspectrum. In this thesis the peak enhancement factor has been computed as proposed by\n\nTorsethaugen and Haver (2004):\n\n\n\n189\n\n? = max\n\n{\n1, 42.2\n\n(\n2? Hs\ngT 2p\n\n)}\n. (C.3)\n\nwhere g is the gravity acceleration.\n\nTorsethaugen wave spectrum\n\nThe Torsethaugen wave spectrum has been commonly used as a model for the double\n\npeak spectra at Norwegian seas. It allows the representation of the sea states as a com-\n\nbination of a locally wind generated sea and an incoming swell system. The simplified\n\nwave spectrum adopted in this thesis can be defined as a summation of two JONSWAP\n\ntype wave spectra as follows:\n\nS??(f) =\n2?\nj=1\n\nEj Sj(f) , (C.4)\n\nwhere j = 1 represents the primary sea system (locally wind generated) and j = 2 is the\n\nsecondary sea system (swell). Regarding the values of E, they can be defined as,\n\n?????\n????\nE =\n\n1\n\n16\nH21Tp1, for j = 1\n\nE =\n1\n\n16\nH22Tp2, for j = 2 ,\n\n(C.5)\n\nwhere H1, Tp1, H2 and Tp2 are given by Eqs. (C.10) and (C.11) for wind sea dominated\n\ncases while for swell dominated cases, Eqs. (C.13) and (C.14) are used to compute these\n\nparameters.\n\nThe non dimensional spectral density, Sj, can be written as,\n\n???\n??\nS??(f) = 3.26 A? f\n\n?4\n1 exp{f\n\n?4\n1 }?\n\n(\nexp\n{\n?0.5(f1?1? )\n\n2\n})\n, for j = 1\n\nS??(f) = 3.26 A? f\n?4\n2 exp{f\n\n?4\n2 }, for j = 2 ,\n\n(C.6)\n\nThe parameters included in Eq.

The computation of these forces allows the estimation of the\n\nmotions of a semisubmersible platform (CHAKRABARTI, 2005). In this appendix, due\n\nto the particular interest the heave motions previously explained in section 3.3, only\n\nthe vertical motion of a platform is characterized, along with a discussion regarding its\n\nmost significant parameters. In order to provide an useful illustration of the heave motion\n\nfeatures, the main characteristics of the platform provided in chapter 5 have been adopted\n\nto compute the relations shown herein.\n\nIn this appendix, the vertical responses of the platform are estimated assuming that\n\nthe exciting forces are consequence of a wave traveling from port to starbord side of the\n\nplatform. This approach allows to keep the model as simple as possible. Thus, using linear\n\ndeep water theory and the Morison equation, the vertical force acting on the platform is\n\nobtained as the sum of the following terms,\n\n\u2022 Columns: It has been assumed that the waves are traveling at a right angle of the\n\nstern-forward direction of the platform. Consequently, the relative phase of the wave\n\nto the port and the starbord sides of the platform is ? = \u00b1kB\n2\n?? t, being B the total\n\nbeam of the platform, k the wave number and ? the wave frequency. Additionally,\n\nthe hydrodynamic mass term of the columns has been assumed sufficiently small to\n\nbe neglected. Therefore, the force acting in each column can be written as follows,\n\nFcz = Pz=?hcAcol = ?g?a Ac exp{?khcol}cos(?) , (D.1)\n\n\n\n194\n\nwhere Acol stands for the area of the column (adopted as a constant along the height\n\nof the column), hcol is the height of the columns.\n\n\u2022 Pontoon sections (port or starbord sides): For these sections of the pontoon the\n\nphase properties are equal to the ones used to estimate the force acting on the\n\ncolumns. Thus,\n\nFpsz = ?Cm??Pps?a?\n2 exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}cos(?) , (D.2)\n\nwith Cm = 1 + Ca and ?Pps = ApL the displacement of each part of the pontoon\n\nunder study.\n\n\u2022 Pontoon section (forward or stern): The procedure followed to estimate the force\n\nacting on these parts of the pontoon is similar to the one adopted above, but in this\n\ncase the phase of the force acting on each longitudinal element of the pontoon is\n\ngiven by ? = kx, with x ? [?B/2,B/2]. consequently, the force acting on one part\n\nof the pontoon can be computed as,\n\nFfsz = ?\n? B/2\n?B/2\n\nCm?Ap?a?\n2 exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}cos(kx?? t)dx =\n\n?\n2\n\nk\nCm?Ap?a?\n\n2 exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}sin\n(\nkB\n\n2\n\n)\ncos(? t) .\n\n(D.3)\n\nThe vertical force acting on the whole structure can be estimated as the sum of the\n\nrespective forces listed above,\n\n\n\n195\n\nFz =?g?a AcolT\n\n?\n?exp{?khcol}?Cm?Pps?ct khcol exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}\n\n?\n?\u00d7\n\n(\ncos(\n\nkB\n\n2\n?? t) + cos(\n\nkB\n\n2\n?? t)\n\n)\n?\n\n4\n\nkB\nCm??Pfs?a?\n\n2 exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}sin(\nkB\n\n2\n) cos(? t)\n\n=?g?a AcolT\n\n?\n?\n?\n?exp{?khcol}?Cm?Pps?ct khcol exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}\n\n?\n? cos(kB\n\n2\n)\n\n?\n4\n\nB\nCm\n?Pfs\n?ct\n\nhcol exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}sin(\nkB\n\n2\n)\n\n?\n? cos(? t) .\n\n(D.4)\n\nNow, the total vertical force can be normalized by the force defined by the product\n\nof the total water plane area, AcolT , and ?g?a,\n\nF?z =\n\n?\n??\n?\n?exp{?khcol}?Cm?Pps?ct khcol exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}\n\n?\n?\n\n2\n\n+\n\n?\n? 4\nB\nCm\n?Pfs\n?ct\n\nhcol exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}\n\n?\n?\n\n2\n?\n??\n\n1\n2\n\ncos(\nkB\n\n2\n??) cos(? t) ,\n\n(D.5)\n\nwhere\n\ntan(?) =\n?\n\n4\n\nB\nCm\n?Pfs\n?ct\n\nhcol exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}\n\nexp{?khcol}?Cm\n?Pps\n?ct\n\nkhcol exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}\n\n. (D.6)\n\nFrom the total vertical force provided in Eq. (D.6), the transfer function of the un-\n\ndamped heave motion is given by,\n\n|Zz| =\n2?gAcolT F\n\n?\nz\n\nczz(1 ? (\n?\n\n?n\n)2)\n\n,\n(D.7)\n\n\n\n196\n\nwhere the restoring coefficient , czz, follows from the hydrostatic buoyancy force of the\n\ncolumns,\n\nczz = 2?gAcolT . (D.8)\n\nOn the other hand, the total mass of the system is given by the mass of the floating\n\nplatform and the hydrodynamic mass of the pontoon,\n\n?? + mzz = ?(2?ct + Cm?pont) . (D.9)\n\nConsequently, the natural frequency of this structure can be estimated as,\n\n?n =\n\n?\n? gAcolT\n\n2?ct + Cm?pont\n\n?\n?\n\n1\n2\n\n. (D.10)\n\nThe relations provided until now are useful to predict the undamped motion of the\n\nsemisubmersible platform under study. As a matter of fact, the heave transfer function\n\npresents a cancellation point close to the resonance and its value at the resonant frequency\n\nis infinite. The effects of the velocity-dependent viscous forces can be introduced through\n\nthe linearized form of the drag component of the Morison equation,\n\nFDLz =\n4\n\n3?\n?CdAp[?? ? z?](?? ? z?) .\n\n(D.11)\n\nwhere ?? is the vertical orbital velocity, z? is the vertical velocity of the platform and Ap is\n\nthe effective area of the pontoon. Therefore, and knowing that [???z?] is the representative\n\nvelocity amplitude, the drag force can be computed in terms of the heave transfer function,\n\nFDLz =\n4\n\n3?\n?CdAp[exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}?|Zz|ei?]?a? Ap(?? ? z?) = b33(?? ? z?) ,\n\n(D.12)\n\n\n\n197\n\nThe resulting terms of the velocity-dependent drag force, bzz??, and damping force,\n\nbzzz?, can be used to estimate the magnitude of the transfer function of the heave motion,\n\nleading to,\n\n|Zz| =\nFz + b33??\n\nczz?a\n\n?\n??\n?\n?1 ? ( ?\n\n?n\n)2\n\n?\n?\n\n2\n\n+\n\n?\n?bzz?\n\nczz\n\n?\n?\n\n2\n?\n??\n\n1\n2\n\n.\n\n(D.13)\n\nFigure D.1: Illustration of heave RAO of motion.\n\nEquation D.13 provides the transfer function of the heave motion, including the drag\n\nand damping forces. Since the value of the velocity-dependent drag force cannot be\n\ncomputed until the velocity of the structure is known, this method to compute the heave\n\nmotion RAO results in an iterative process. It is convenient to highlight that the resulting\n\ntransfer function is characterized by:\n\n\u2022 As it has been shown before, the inertia forces vanishes close to the resonance of\n\nthe heave motion. Consequently, the vertical motion of the structure depends ex-\n\nclusively of the velocity-dependent drag forces. Thus, the amplitude at the (former)\n\ncancellation point close to the resonance of the motion can be estimated as,\n\n\n\n198\n\n|Zz| =\nb33??\n\nczz\n\n?\n?1 ? ( ?\n\n?n\n)2\n\n?\n?\n.\n\n(D.14)\n\n\u2022 Regarding the amplitude of the motion at the resonance frequency, the first term of\n\nthe denominator is reduced to zero (leading to infinite amplitude of the motions if\n\nonly the inertia forces are computed), leaving only the damping term. Consequently,\n\nthe amplitude of the motion at the resonant frequency is given by,\n\n|Zz| =\nFz + b33??\n\n?a (bzz??)\n. (D.15)\n\nThe features described above, with regards to the heave motion transfer function,\n\nare also shown in Fig. D.1. This figure provides the RAO of the heave motion esti-\n\nmated through the relations deduced in this appendix and using the characteristics of the\n\nplatform provided in chapter 5. This figure also reflects other characteristics previously\n\nlisted in section 3.3 regarding Fig. 3.3, such as the fact that in short waves the motion\n\nof the platform is minimum and in long waves the platform predictably follows the wave\n\namplitude. The estimated heave RAO also shows that the resonant frequency is equal\n\nto ?n = 0.262rad/s, that is close to frequency of the vertical (inertia) forces cancella-\n\ntion (?c = 0.281rad/s). In the high frequency range, that corresponds to short wave\n\nperiods, the magnitude of the transfer function indicates successively smaller oscillation\n\namplitudes, with multiple cancellation points due to the phase of the force and the small\n\ninfluence of the velocity-dependent forces. Finally, the analytical approach adopted in\n\nthis appendix to deduce the heave RAO can be intended as a reasoned explanation of the\n\ninfluence that non-linear viscous forces will have on the heave motion near the resonance,\n\nmodifying the linearly estimated responses as well as the cancellation point close to the\n\nresonance as shown in section 3.3.\n\n\n\n199\n\nAPPENDIX E \u2013 CONSTRUCTION OF A\n\nSMOOTH PRIOR\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nIn section 4.4.1 it has been shown that the hypothesis that the unknown spectrum\n\nshould be smooth can be expressed through a matrix that stands as an approximation\n\nof the second order finite difference. Thus, the prior distribution is given by (for a given\n\ndirection or frequency),\n\np(x) ? exp\n\n??\n?? ? Hx ?\n\n2\n\n2?2\n\n??\n? , (E.1)\n\nwhere H can be defined for a given frequency (m) as (following a similar procedure that\n\nin section 4.4.1),\n\nH =\n\n?\n???????\n\n1 ?2 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n\n0 1 ?2 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n. . .\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 ?2 1\n\n?\n??????? ? R\n\n(K?1)\u00d7(K+1) , (E.2)\n\nwhere K is the number of discrete wave heading considered.\n\nNevertheless, due to the rank of matrix H (that is K?1) boundary conditions should\n\nbe imposed. In the direction domain (NIELSEN, 2005) it is assumed that: S??(?m,?0) =\n\nS??(?m,?K) and S??(?m,?K+1) = S??(?m,?1). These conditions leads to the following\n\nmatrix H1,\n\n\n\n200\n\nH1 =\n\n?\n???????\n?2 1 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 1\n\n1 ?2 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n. . .\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n1 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 1 ?2\n\n?\n??????? ? R\n\n(K+1)\u00d7(K+1) , (E.3)\n\nWhen it comes to the frequency-domain, for a given direction k, the hypothesis is\n\nthat S is smooth and close to zero in the boundary. Thus,\n\nS??(?0,?k) =\n1\n\n2\n(S??(?0?1,?k)+S??(?0+1,?k))+?p0 =\n\n1\n\n2\n(S??(?0+1,?k)))+?p0 , ?p0 ? N(0,?\n\n2\np) ,\n\n(E.4)\n\nS??(?M,?k) =\n1\n\n2\n(S??(?M?1,?k)+S??(?M+1,?k))+?pM =\n\n1\n\n2\n(S??(?M?1,?k)))+?pM , ?pM ? N(0,?\n\n2\np) ,\n\n(E.5)\n\nIt should be highlighted that the wave spectrum has been extended by 0 outside of\n\nthe frequency-domain since the prior believe says that is smooth. Finally, the resulting\n\nH2 is,\n\nH2 =\n\n?\n???????\n\n2 ?1 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n\n1 ?2 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n. . .\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 ?1 2\n\n?\n??????? ? R\n\n(M+1)\u00d7(M+1) , (E.6)\n\nHowever, since the limits of the frequency-domain are imposed by the limitation due\n\nto the frequency insensitivity of the sensor (in this case the semisubmersible platform),\n\nthere is no reason to believe that S must be zero at the boundary. Since the real values of\n\nthe spectrum at the boundary in the frequency-domain are unknown, they can be assumed\n\nGaussian random variables, that properly adhere to the Bayesian nature of the problem,\n\nsuch as,\n\nS??(?0,?k) ? N\n\n?\n?0, ?2\n\n?20\n\n?\n? and S??(?M,?k)) ? N\n\n?\n?0, ?2\n\n?2M\n\n?\n? , (E.7)\n\n\n\n201\n\nTherefore, the prior distribution in the frequency-domain (in direction k) is given by,\n\nP(x) ? exp\n\n??\n?? ? H2n x ?\n\n2\n\n2?2\n\n??\n? , (E.8)\n\nwhere H2n is,\n\nH2n =\n\n?\n???????\n?0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n\n1 ?2 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n. . .\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 ?M\n\n?\n??????? ? R\n\n(M+1)\u00d7(M+1) , (E.9)\n\nThe value of the variance in each component of S should be computed in order to\n\nestimate the values of ?20 and ?\n2\nM . From Eq. (4.38) it is already known that the variance\n\nof each element of the sea spectrum can be expressed as,\n\nVar(Sj) = ej(\n\n?\nRM+1\n\nS2P(S)dS)eTj = ?\n2ej(H\n\nT\n2n\n\nH2n)\n?1ej , (E.10)\n\nwhere ej stands for the j\nth canonical basis vector in RM+1.\n\nIf the relation in Eq. (E.10) is computed using the matrix obtained in Eq. (E.6), one\n\nmay realize that the maximum uncertainty is reached at the middle of the domain, since\n\nit is the furthest point from the boundary. Consequently, in order to make all the values\n\nequally uncertain, the following relation must be set:\n\nVar(SM/2) = Var(S0) = Var(SM ) = ?\n2eM/2(H\n\nT\n2n\n\nH2n)\n?1eM/2 . (E.11)\n\nThis relation leads to,\n\n?20 = ?\n2\nM =\n\n1\n\neM/2(H\nT\n2n\n\nH2n)\n?1eM/2\n\n. (E.12)\n\nHowever, Eq. (E.13) requires to solve a non-linear equation, since H2n depends on ?\n2\n0\n\nand ?2M . Thus, in order to simplify the computing process, Eq. (E.13) may be simplified\n\nas,\n\n\n\n202\n\n?20 = ?\n2\nM =\n\n1\n\neM/2(H\nT\n2 H2)\n\n?1eM/2\n. (E.13)\n\nThis modified boundary condition introduces slight changes on the original prior dis-\n\ntribution (discussed in section 4.4.1). These modifications may improve the tendency of\n\nthe method of locating spurious energy peaks at the bow and stern of the vessel in beam\n\nsea conditions, increasing the chances of determining these energy peaks elsewhere. Since\n\nthe data used in this thesis does not reflect the drawback identified by Bispo et al. (2016),\n\nthe evaluation of the effect resulting from this modification is something that has been\n\nleft as a future work.\n\n\n\n203\n\nAPPENDIX F \u2013 DRAG EFFECTS\n\nARISING FROM\n\nMOORING LINES AND\n\nRISERS\n\nThe semisubmersible platform, its risers and mooring lines make up a global system\n\nthat has a complex dynamic response when excited by waves. In fact, the dynamics\n\nof a semisubmersible platform is quite different from the one presented by ship-shaped\n\nvessel commonly used to make wave inference, such as a FPSO (BISPO et al., 2016).\n\nAmong other factors, an important part of this difference is related to the fact that the\n\nsemisubmersible\u2019s motions are only weakly damped, one reason for this being the fact that\n\nradiated waves are small due large draft and the cylindrical shape of the columns. For\n\nthis reason, the dynamics of semisubmersibles is known to be more sensitive to damping\n\neffects arising from mooring lines and risers (see, for instance Wijaya (2009)). Moreover,\n\nthe results presented ins ection 5.2.3 suggest that a proper study of the influence of the\n\ndamping and stiffness induced by risers and mooring lines in the heave RAO is needed\n\nto assess the accuracy of the method for estimating extreme waves with very high peak\n\nperiods (typical above 20s), which will necessarily impose a significant resonant response\n\nof the heave motion of the Asgard-B platform.\n\nThe relevance of a more refined analysis of the motions in high wave periods becomes\n\neven stronger for future wave estimations based on a real semisubmersible platform. For\n\nthis purpose a sensitive analysis has been carried out by means of time-domain analysis in\n\nANSYS-AQWA, which provides a dedicated resource for the motion analysis of floating\n\nplatform as well as the effects arising from the submerged lines (see, for instance Jeon\n\net al. (2013)). Accordingly, the resulting model (see Fig. F.1) was composed by the\n\n\n\n204\n\nhull of the platform, which was attached to 16 spread mooring lines and a flexible riser\n\nsystem of altogether 37 risers, including: Simple catenary risers, lazy wave and lazy-S\n\nrisers and whose main features are provided in (LIAN, 1997). The riser and mooring lines\n\nare modelled in the software as a Morsion elements, while its structural properties and\n\nresponses are modelled using the ANSYS-MECHANIAL APDL module (see (ANSYS,\n\n2013)). Although the software controls the dynamics of the risers and mooring lines,\n\nsome coefficients, such as added mass and drag, as well as the main inertia properties\n\nof the submerged lines must be provided. For this purpose, the values of the drag and\n\nadded mass coefficient specified in (SARPKAYA, 2010) have been adopted, meanwhile\n\nthe data detailed in (LIAN, 1997) are adopted to model the mass and inertia properties\n\nof the submerged lines.\n\nFigure F.1: ANSYS-AQWA model including the submerged lines.\n\nTherefore, mooring and riser systems were included in the analysis in order to repro-\n\nduce both the damping and stiffness effects. Figure F.2 shows the amplitude of the heave\n\nmotion, z, along the time-domain. This result corresponds to the test carried out with\n\nANSYS-AQWA including risers and mooring lines, with a regular wave with a steepness\n\nequal to 2%. The response of the heave motion has been normalized by the wave am-\n\nplitude, A. In the starting region (T &lt;400s) the mean amplitude of the heave response\n\nfluctuated significantly, time that seems to be related with the time span needed to reach\n\nthe force equilibrium and, as a consequence, the steady state. Concerning the responses\n\n\n\n205\n\nestimated for T > 400s (referent to the steady state), the mean value of the response\n\namplitude remained approximately constant.\n\nTime [s]\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\n\nz/\nA\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFigure F.2: Normalized heave amplitude, for the test with wave steepness equal to 2%\nand including the risers and mooring lines.\n\nThe RAO resulting from taking into account the submerged lines is included in Fig. F.3\n\nfor two different wave steepnesses: 0.64% and 2% (orange rhombus and magenta squares,\n\nrespectively) along with the RAO obtained previously for the same wave steepness in\n\nFig. 5.6 (magenta rhombus and orange squares, respectively). One may realize that the\n\nresults in this figure including the submerged lines were carried out only for periods up\n\nto 24s, this is due to the lack of convergence of the simulations for higher periods.\n\nThe RAOs presented in Fig. F.3 show that the expected response of the heave motion,\n\nincluding risers and mooring effects in the numerical analysis, present narrow differences\n\nwith the RAOs obtained taking in account only the drag effects acting on the pontoon.\n\nTherefore, this preliminary assessment indicates that no significant differences in the esti-\n\nmations of the sea condition should be expected if this new RAO is adopted. Nonetheless,\n\na dedicated study (experimental and/or numerical) must be carried out in order to accu-\n\nrately determine the possible effects that submerged lines as well as environmental effects\n\n(i.e. wind &amp; currents) may have on the heave responses close to the resonance when deal-\n\n\n\n206\n\nPeriod [s]\n6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28\n\nA\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\ne\n [\nm\n\n/m\n]\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\nHeave RAO\n\nWAMIT Damp. 5%\nAQWA Damp. 5%\nAQWA TD+Morison Steepness=0.64%\nAQWA TR Moorison+Mooring+Risers Steepness=0.64%\nAQWA TD+Morison Steepness=2%\nAQWA TR Moorison+Mooring+Risers Steepness=2%\nExperimental Steepness=2%\n\nAmplitude\n= 3.77m\n\nAmplitude\n= 1.21m\n\nFigure F.3: RAO heave, including the drag effects due to the submerged lines.\n\ning with the motions recorded aboard a full-scale semisubmersible platform and, thus,\n\navoid unnecessary accuracy losses in the estimation of extreme wave conditions."}]}}}
