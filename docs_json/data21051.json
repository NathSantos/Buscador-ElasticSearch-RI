Esta nova medida pretende substituir \n\na pr\u00e1tica do bailout que tem sido apontada como causa da atual crise da d\u00edvida \n\nsoberana da Zona Euro. \n\nCom este trabalho pretende-se analisar esta nova legisla\u00e7\u00e3o e, \n\nretrospetivamente, aplic\u00e1-la ao Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo (BES), um banco portugu\u00eas \n\nque foi resolvido a 4 de Agosto de 2014 atrav\u00e9s de uma medida de separa\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nativos.

Para al\u00e9m disso, apurou-se que era suficiente que os \n\ncredores do BES suportassem perdas na ordem dos 28% para que n\u00e3o fosse \n\nnecess\u00e1ria qualquer interven\u00e7\u00e3o ao banco. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave (max 5): Bail-in; regula\u00e7\u00e3o banc\u00e1ria; Zona Euro; Directiva para \n\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o e resolu\u00e7\u00e3o banc\u00e1ria; Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo (BES).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n vii \n\nAbstract \n\nIn the beginning of 2016, the European Commission imposed, in the Eurozone, \n\nthe bail-in mechanism as a standard procedure to recover and resolve banks \n\nwhich have been weakened by the financial crisis. This new measure intends to \n\nreplace the bailout practice that has been refered to be associated with the current \n\nEurozone sovereign debt crisis.  \n\nThe purpose of this paper is to study this new banking legislation and, \n\nretrospectively, apply it to Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo (BES), a Portuguese bank which \n\nwas resolved on 4 August 2014 through an asset separation tool. This exercise \n\nendeavours to understand what the bail-in mechanism is, how it is performed \n\nand, in the particular case of BES to analyse how it would have been different \n\nfrom the resolution that effectively occurred. \n\nThe results suggest that the application of the bail-in mechanism to BES would \n\nhave granted, in the worst case scenario, savings for the Portuguese State of about \n\n60%. In addition, it was observed that it would have been sufficient that the \n\ninvestors of the entity had sustained losses of 28%, in order for the bank not to \n\nneed any intervention. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Bail-in; Bank Regulation; Eurozone; Directive for Bank Recovery \n\nand Resolution; Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo (BES). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n ix \n\nSummary \n\nAgradecimentos ....................................................................................................... iii \n\nResumo ....................................................................................................................... v \n\nAbstract .................................................................................................................... vii \n\nSummary .................................................................................................................... ix \n\nIndex of Figures ......................................................................................................... xi \n\nIndex of Tables ........................................................................................................xiii \n\nIntroduction .............................................................................................................. 15 \n\nChapter 1.

This unexpected situation \n\nrequired urgent measures to stabilize the whole economic structure and one of \n\nthem was the bailout of banks. \n\nGovernments of several countries \u2013 the United States, the United Kingdom, \n\nIreland, Greece, Portugal, and more - chose to bailout their distressed financial \n\ninstitutions because they feared that the failure of one bank could cause the \n\nbankruptcy of more \u2013 risk of contagion. So, bearing in mind the devastating \n\nresults that a failure of just one bank could cause to the entire financial system, \n\nand thus to the economy and society, governments aided these institutions by \n\nguaranteeing their liabilities1, providing impaired asset relief2, restructuring aid \n\nloans3 and even by recapitalizing these entities4, so that they could restore their \n\nviability. \n\nHowever, this bailout process is associate with two main problems. First, the \n\nprocess involves the use of taxpayers' money to repair damages made by banks\u2019 \n\npoor investments and risky behaviour. This intensifies the idea that financial \n\ninstitutions are too big to fail leading to moral hazard - managers of banks will \n\n                                                \n1 Governments commit themselves to pay a failing institution\u2019s debt in case it fails. \n2 Governments take measures to liberate banks from non-performing assets that, by the principle of prudence, had \nto be impaired. \n3 Extension of the maturity of a loan, usually causing a decrease in the value of the instalments, so that the debtor \nis able to pay without defaulting. \n4 Injection of public funds to increase the capital of the bank and thus its solvency.  \n\n\n\n \n\ncontinue with their irresponsible behaviour of excessive risk taking because the \n\nburden of their mistakes is allocated to someone else and they do not internalize \n\nthe true value of risk. Therefore, bailing out a bank does not instil discipline in \n\nthe institutions, making them likely to fail again in the future. \n\nThe second problem is that by financing their recovery, the State itself is \n\nabsorbing the banks\u2019 debt and increasing its own, which can lead to a sovereign \n\ndebt crisis, like the one currently being experienced in some European countries. \n\nTo address the moral hazard issue and reduce the public cost of bank failures, \n\nthe European Commission (EC) implemented the Bank Recovery and Resolution \n\nDirective (BRRD) that, among other measures to create a comprehensive \n\nrecovery and resolution regime, it abolishes the bailout option and enforces the \n\nbail-in mechanism as a standard procedure to deal with ailing banks across the \n\nEurozone. \n\nTo bail-in a bank means to recapitalize it through the write-down5  of liabilities \n\nand/or their conversion to equity, allowing the institution to continue as a going \n\nconcern 6  and avoiding the disruption of the financial system that would be \n\ncaused by stopping or interrupting its critical services (The European \n\nCommission, 2014c). In other words, the bail-in tool enshrined in this new \n\ndirective aims to transfer the costs of recovering a bank from taxpayers to \n\ncreditors and shareholders of the institutions, making bank investors and \n\nmanagers liable for their actions and consequently more disciplined. \n\nHowever, even though this appears to be a fair solution which will only affect \n\nthese institutions\u2019 investors, the fact is that it will influence the entire society. As \n\nthis resolution increases the risks 7  for investors, so does the premium they \n\nrequire for their funds, meaning that the banks\u2019 financing costs will rise. If credit \n\n                                                \n5 The understanding that a debt is partially uncollectible and therefore that amount has be considered as a loss. To \nwrite-off a debt means to consider the entire debt as uncollectible and thus a loss.  \n6 \u201cA going concern is a business that functions without the intention or threat of liquidation for the foreseeable \nfuture, usually regarded as at least within 12 months.\u201d (The European Commission, 2012) \n7 Probability of loss and/or variability of returns (Gup, 2011, p. 26). \n\n\n\n \n\ninstitutions intend to keep the spread on their interest rates8, this implies that the \n\nfinancing costs for the final consumer will also increase. \n\nSo, besides having the benefit of discipline the banking sector, the bail-in \n\nresolution tool has the downside of increasing interest rates which may \n\nconsequently decrease consumption and investment in the real economy, \n\nslowing down economic growth. \n\nFor this is currently an important matter, the purpose of this paper is to \n\ndescribe the new legislation and perform a practical example to better explain \n\nhow it works. Therefore, this thesis is divided in two parts, one that describes the \n\ntheory behind the bail-in mechanism and the other that applies it. \n\nIn order to make this exercise more realistic, the practical component will be \n\nperformed, retrospectively, in Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, a Portuguese bank which \n\nwas resolved on 4 August 2014 through an asset separation resolution tool. This \n\nway, besides the application of the bail-in mechanism, it is possible to obtain \n\nsome insights about the differences between this new resolution framework and \n\nthe resolution that effectively occurred. \n\nA similar work was developed by (Conlon &amp; Cotter, 2014), in which the \n\nauthors applied retrospectively the bail-in tool in European banks which failed \n\nduring the global crisis, analysing the proportion of the liabilities that would \n\nhave been written down to cover for losses. Their empirical findings suggested \n\nthat equity holders and subordinated bond holders would have suffered the \n\ngreatest losses while senior debt holders would have loss significantly less. There \n\nwere no evidences that unsecured depositors would have experience losses. \n\nSome other papers related to the subject include (Zhou et al., 2012), where the \n\nauthors study the effectiveness and usefulness of the bail-in resolution tool as a \n\nway to restore the viability of distressed institutions, discuss potential risks and \n\n                                                \n8 Banks profit from this spread which represents the difference between the interest rates provided to their clients \nand the interest rate at which they obtained funding. \n\n\n\n \n\npropose solutions to mitigate them. In (The European Commission, 2012), \n\nauthors assess the quantitative impact of this tool in the annual EU GDP, having \n\nconcluded that the expected annual net effect will be positive and amount to \n\n0,34%-0,62% of the EU GDP. \n\nThis paper contributes to the debate by analysing a specific case of a highly \n\npolemical resolution where individual investors loss their lifetime savings. \n\nThe bail-in exercise on BES, for academic purposes, is going to be based on the \n\ninstitution\u2019s financial report from the first semester of 20149. So it would be as if \n\nthe institution was resolved on 1 July 2014. \n\nUsing the disclosed consolidated financial statements of the company, the bail-\n\nin will be applied as if the purpose were to restore the entity\u2019s ability to comply \n\nwith the conditions to continue to carry out its activities (EU Regulation, 2014, \n\nArticle 27).  \n\nThis work is structured as follows. Chapter 1 briefly introduces the financial \n\nsystem, why it is needed and how it works. Chapter 2 describes the last decade\u2019s \n\nfinancial events, namely the financial crisis of 2007, started in the USA and its \n\nspill overs. Chapter 3 analyses the consequences of the financial crisis in Europe \n\nto ease the understanding of the regulatory measures set by the European \n\nCommission to end the current crisis and to prevent future ones. Chapter 4 \n\nfocuses specifically in describing the legal framework of the bail-in resolution \n\ntool and stating its benefits and disadvantages. Finally, Chapter 5 concerns to \n\nBanco Esp\u00edrito Santo, why and how it was resolved and how the resolution \n\nthrough the bail-in tool would have been implemented. \n\n \n\n                                                \n9 This is the last available data on the credit institution. \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1. The financial system \n\nIt is the financial system\u2019s function to assure a smooth allocation of capital \n\nbetween its participants, through a borrowing-lending process that allows the \n\nsupply of capital to equal its demand, at a given interest rate10. This means that \n\nborrowers in need of capital will be able to obtain funds from those willing to lend.  \n\nTo ease the interactions between these agents is the main purpose of financial \n\ninstitutions11. In other words, they act as intermediaries, creating a bridge between \n\nthose who have surplus of money (savers) and those who have money shortage \n\n(borrowers). \n\nNot all the transfers from borrowers to lenders are made through a financial \n\nintermediary, however, these institutions are highly specialized and thus reduce the \n\nrisks and searching costs12 for individuals. In this sense, financial institutions are an \n\nessential pillar in society as they support payment systems, enable individuals to \n\nsave and invest for their future and then channel those savings to support the \n\neconomy, by lending the funds to consumption and investment purposes (The \n\nEuropean Commission, 2014a). \n\nRegarding the balance sheet of these institutions, the assets\u2019 side is mostly \n\ncomposed by clients\u2019 liabilities \u2013 debt and equity securities issued by companies \n\nand consumers such as stocks, bonds, loans, leases, mortgages -, and the \n\n                                                \n10 Price paid for the use of credit (Gup, 2011, p. 34) \n11 There are numerous institutions that act like financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks, finance companies, \nhedge funds, pension funds, private equity funds, stockbrokers and dealers (Gup, 2011, p. 23). \n12  Searching costs represent the resources spent in the search of the wanted product or service. When a consumer uses \na specialized intermediary instead of trying to find a direct provider, he is saving money, time and more resources.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\ninstitutions\u2019 liabilities by the claims that clients and investors hold against them \u2013 \n\nchecking accounts, savings deposits and banks\u2019 own debt.  \n\nThese institutions create value mostly by investing low risk and high liquidity13 \n\nassets received from their clients - checking accounts and savings deposits - into \n\nsecurities with higher risk and lower liquidity, since higher risks provide higher \n\npotential returns (Gup, 2011, pp. 23-24, 30).  \n\nDue to the nature of their business \u2013 a very interconnected system that makes \n\nprofit out of lending short-term against long-term assets -, banks can face liquidity \n\nshortage (Gup, 2011, pp. 24). This means that, in theory, they have the ability to \n\ncomply with their short-term commitments yet not all at once as they are unable to \n\nturn their long-term assets into cash quickly. For this reason they operate on the \n\nbasis of public trust and it only takes the loss of confidence in one bank to generate \n\nfinancial instability. \n\nIn a simplified manner, if people started doubting of one bank, they would \n\nwithdraw their funds from the institution causing its failure. Consequently, due to \n\ninterconnectedness of the financial system, other banks would also start \n\nexperiencing losses, caused by the write-down of their credits towards the failed \n\ninstitution. In turn, depositors of these banks, sensing their difficulties, will also \n\nwithdraw their funds leading to their failure. \n\n And the cycle will keep on repeating, with damaging effects not only to the \n\nfinancial sector but also to the real economy. This is why it is so important to have \n\na transparent banking sector in which the society can trust. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n                                                \n13 The level of celerity and ease with which an asset or instrument can be traded in the market, at a stable price.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2. The financial crisis of 2007/08 and \nits spill-overs \n\nFrom 1970 to 2007, the USA\u2019s population had grown from 205 million to 302 \n\nmillion thus increasing demand for housing. In order to support the lodging of its \n\ncitizens, the U.S. Congress approved measures to facilitate housing acquisition, \n\nsuch as interest rate caps. Low interest rates associated with generous commercial \n\nbanks made it easy for anyone to obtain a mortgage regardless of their ability to \n\nrepay \u2013 subprime mortgages14 (Gup, 2011, pp. 3-5). \n\nBanks were lending large amounts of money for two main reasons. First, they \n\nwere being heavily financed by foreign investors and governments \u2013 mostly Japan \n\nand China. And second because they were using an instrument called Mortgage-\n\nBacked Security15 (MBS) that allowed them to negotiate a loan with a client and then \n\nsell that asset to another financial institution willing to buy. \n\nThe creation of securities like the MBS changed the entire banking system \n\nbusiness model: initially, banks would generate-and-hold their loans, but the pre-\n\ncrisis trend was to originate-and-distribute them (Gup, 2011, p. 40). \n\nThe widespread of MBS incentivized risky behaviour on commercial banks \n\nbecause, since they did not need to hold on to the loan, they did not have any \n\nincentives to verify the debtors\u2019 rating. So banks would provide loans to low rated \n\n                                                \n14 High-risk mortgages loans given to individuals with low credit ratings, and/or high loan-to-value ratios and/or \ndebt-to-income ratios above 50 percent (Gup, 2011, p. 7). \n15 The sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\nborrowers and then sell those mortgages in the secondary market, disposing of the \n\nrisk and still get a positive cash flow. \n\nThe buyers of the MBS, uncertain about the solidity of the loans 16, would then \n\npurchase Credit Default Swaps (CDS) 17  as a way to insure the assets. The CDS \n\nmarket rose \u201cfrom about $6.4 trillion in December 2004 to about $57.9 trillion in \n\nDecember 2007\u201d (Gup, 2011, p. 9). \n\nThe financing given to housing purchase also boosted the Real Estate bubble, but \n\nwhen the adjustable interest rates of many subprime mortgage loans rose, the \n\nborrowers lost the ability to comply with their commitments and defaulted.  \n\nAs clients defaulted, banks proceeded to foreclosure18 the assets used to secure \n\nthe debt in order to recover some of the invested money. However, the price of the \n\nresidences, which had inflated with the demand, fell sharply as banks \n\nunsuccessfully tried to sell them back. \n\nThis Real Estate Crisis in the USA rapidly became a worldwide banking problem. \n\nThe MBS had been sold all across the world19, so when the American Real Estate \n\nbubble burst, banks worldwide started experiencing massive asset impairments \n\nthat could not be offset because they were too leveraged20. \n\nAll of a sudden, international credit institutions were left with large amounts of \n\nnon-performing loans that had to be considered as losses, insurance companies \n\nwere also facing losses covering reimbursements to CDS purchasers, public \n\nauthorities had to inject huge funds into these financial institutions to stabilize the \n\n                                                \n16 There was a considerable asymmetry of information between mortgages creators and MBS purchasers.  \n17 A form of insurance or hedge for MBS - if the borrower defaults, the holder of the debt is paid by the insurer (Gup, \n2011, p. 24) \n18 When clients default banks have several ways to try to recover some of their investments: they can prosecute the \ndebtor to force the payment, try to restructure the loan in a way that allows him to pay, foreclosure the collateral (sell \nit in the market) or sell the loan at discount to other financial institution. \n19 The international banking markets were too integrated which increased the systemic risk - risk that exist when an \nentire sector is vulnerable to certain types of shocks \u2013 and the risk of contagion - the possibility that the consequences \nof a shock in an institution/country could spread to others. \n20 A company gets leverage once it uses debt to acquire assets. When an institution has significantly more debt than \nequity is considered to be highly leveraged and, in case the assets underperform, the company will fail without a \ncapital buffer to sustain the loss. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\neconomy as society lost confidence in the solvency and liquidity of the financial \n\nsystem (Gup, 2011, p. 26). \n\nSo, what started as an American Real Estate Crisis grew to a banking crisis that \n\nquickly spread into other market segments and countries (Ackermann, 2008), \n\nbecoming a global financial crisis transmitted to the real economy and resulting in \n\na massive contraction of liquidity and credit availability (Gup, 2011, p. 26). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3. The European reform \n\n3.1. The State Aid and the Eurozone debt crisis of 2010/11 \n\nIn Europe, between October 2008 and December 2012, Member States provided \n\napproximately 592 billion \u20ac (4.6% of EU 2012 GDP) of capital support to the banking \n\nsector, as an attempt to contain the crisis (The European Commission, 2013a).  \n\nThis unprecedented level of state support, although necessary to quickly stabilize \n\nthe sector and prevent contagion, led to a sovereign debt crisis in Europe causing \n\ndeep economic damages, such as high unemployment and income and wealth loss. \n\nMoreover, the increase in the public expenditure began a vicious circle between \n\nbanks and the State. As credit institutions were suffering considerable asset \n\nimpairments and dilapidation of their balance sheets, States, confronted with the \n\npossible insolvency of important banks in the economy, decided to bail them out. \n\nBy financing their recovery using taxpayers\u2019 funds, States deteriorated public \n\naccounts. This caused an increase in governments\u2019 default risk leading to a \n\ndowngrade in their credit ratings and a consequent raise in their refinancing costs. \n\nIn turn, banks that were exposed to their sovereign\u2019s bonds21 faced losses in those \n\nassets22 (Gennaioli, Martin, &amp; Rossi, 2014). \n\n                                                \n21 Usually, banks hold government bonds because these are considered very liquid assets, allowing them to perform \nday-to-day activities and to have a buffer of safe assets (Gennaioli, Martin, &amp; Rossi, 2014). \n22 An increase in the risk of an asset causes a decrease in its price. This is considered the discount given to the investor, \nto incentivize him to take the risk. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n\nThus, when a bank is exposed to its own sovereign, any State aid to the financial \n\nsector will have negative repercussions to both parties. \n\nIn addition to this negative circle, public support to banks also shifts tax payers\u2019 \n\ncontributions away from essential public goods, increases moral hazard in the \n\nbanking industry and causes distortions in the economy, such as competition \n\nbiases23. \n\nHence, one of the first reforms in the EU after the beginning of the Crisis was to \n\nminimize and establish harmonized limits to the State support to credit institutions \n\nacross Member States. These new restrictions were issued in a Banking \n\nCommunication from the EC and took effect on 1 August 2013 (The European \n\nCommission, 2013b). \n\nThis Communication specified that all the aid has to be approved by the \n\nCommission and for that to occur the distressed credit institution must present a \n\nplausible restructuring plan that ensures its long-term viability and that complies \n\nwith the burden-sharing requirements. \n\nThese burden-sharing requirements were created so that aided institutions and \n\ntheir investors bear some responsibility for their failure with their own resources \n\nand by paying an adequate remuneration to public authorities whenever they \n\nintervene. The burden sharing hierarchy is subsequently described in subchapter \n\n3.2. and in chapter 4. \n\nThe EC also states that it is important that credit institutions, whether they are \n\nsound or facing difficulties, adopt measures to minimize the state support that may \n\ninclude the replacement of the board and of the executive, the imposition of stricter \n\nremuneration policies to executives, the reduction of disbursements and the \n\nincrease of fund retention especially when the institution is already ailing (e.g. \n\n                                                \n23 Banks that are given financial aid have competitive advantages compared with their industry\u2019s peers.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n27 \n\ndividend retention and avoidance of repurchase of capital instruments) (The \n\nEuropean Commission, 2013b). \n\n3.2. The need for a Banking Union and the Single \n\nRulebook24 \n\nThe crisis unveiled numerous breaches in the financial markets\u2019 legislation and \n\nsupervision. It also showed lack of responsibility, integrity and transparency in the \n\nfinancial sector that led to \u201cthe evaporation of trust in the market and related \n\nliquidity squeezes, weak bank balance sheets, high private and public debt levels, \n\nlow interest rates, the recession and weak economic growth prospects\u201d (The \n\nEuropean Commission, 2014a).  \n\nEven more, during the crisis, the European Union underwent through the \n\nfragmentation of its internal financial market as different cross-border legislation \n\nfor bank recovery and resolution caused uncertainty and undermined investment \n\nand cooperation between institutions from different countries. Individual Member \n\nStates applied uncoordinated measures to resolve their own financial issues, \n\ncausing investors to flight to safety (Conlon &amp; Cotter, 2014, 2015). This damaged the \n\nsingle currency and the single market for free movement of capitals and led to a \n\ndeficiency of liquidity in the market (EU Regulation, 2014).  \n\nAs a result, to reform the sector became a priority for European banking \n\nauthorities in order to provide stability to the economy, stimulate growth and to \n\nprevent future crises. Yet, these reforms needed to be made at a Eurozone level in \n\norder to assure consistency across Member States and to guarantee the functioning \n\nof the internal market. \n\n                                                \n24 This subchapter is based on the European Commission MEMO/1 4/294 - Banking Union: restoring financial stability \nin the Eurozone (The European Commission, 2014c) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n\nTherefore the European Commission created the Banking Union (BU) - an \n\ninstitutional and legal framework for financial services, mandatory for all Euro Area \n\nMember States and open for all the EU Members -, to complete the economic and \n\nmonetary union. \n\nThis Banking Union aims to restore the public\u2019s confidence in the financial \n\nsystem by making it sounder and more transparent, with greater capital quality and \n\nquantity, more protection for depositors and enhanced supervision. It is also \n\nexpected that these measures will break the negative relation between banks\u2019 failure \n\nand the worsening of governments\u2019 fiscal positions by putting the failure\u2019s onus on \n\nprivate investors and reducing the moral hazard. \n\n\u201cThe Single Rulebook is the foundation of the Banking Union\u201d, because it \n\nrepresents the common framework \u201ccovering regulatory and prudential rules for \n\ncredit institutions, financial conglomerates and investment firms\u201d to harmonize the \n\nEuropean financial system, making it more transparent and integrated (The \n\nEuropean Commission, 2014a). These are the most basic rules that each bank must \n\ncomply with in order for the BU to work. \n\nThis rulebook establishes three main pillars, each one safeguarding its respective \n\nlegislation: \n\n? The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) addresses crisis prevention \n\nthrough an improved supervisory system with higher capital requirements and \n\nenhanced depositors\u2019 protection. This mechanism is responsible for the \n\nenforcement of the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV and \n\nCRR) and the Deposits Guarantee Schemes (DGS); \n\n? The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) focuses on early intervention \n\nwhenever institutions underperform, but they also manage failures if recovery \n\nprocedures are unsuccessful. This mechanism sustains the Bank Recovery and \n\nResolution Directive (BRRD); \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n? European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS): the third pillar was proposed \n\non 24 November 2015 and has not yet entered in force, however its purpose is to \n\nreplace the national deposits guarantee scheme (DGS) as a way of further \n\nweakening the link between banks and their national sovereigns (The European \n\nCommission, 2015). EDIS will be explained in conjunction with the DGS. \n\n3.2.1. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)25  \n\nThe crisis revealed deficiencies in supervision at a global scale and since \n\nstrengthening regulations without control is worthless, on November 2014, the \n\nSingle Supervisory Mechanism, the first pillar of the Banking Union, was \n\nimplemented. \n\nThe idea behind this mechanism is to create a specialized, independent and \n\nsupranational supervisor that assesses and enforces the compliance of the BU rules, \n\nin all of its credit institution. This control will ensure that banks become more solid \n\nand less prone to shocks, preventing future crisis and strengthening the trust in the \n\nfinancial system. \n\nThis oversight responsibility was assigned to the European Central Bank (ECB) \n\nthat is now in charge of the direct supervision of the BU\u2019s significant credit \n\ninstitutions26, while the remaining banks will continue to be supervised by their \n\nnational competent authorities (NCAs), even though in close coordination with the \n\nECB that at any moment may request to directly supervise less significant \n\ninstitutions. \n\nNevertheless, even in significant credit institutions, supervisory tasks are \n\ndivided between the ECB and the NCAs according to their relative importance. In \n\n                                                \n25 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/13/780 - Legislative package for banking supervision in \nthe Eurozone \u2013 frequently asked questions (The European Commission, 2013c) \n26 Banks holding more than \u20ac30 billion on assets or \u2013 unless the value of its assets is below \u20ac 5 billion - that constitute \nmore than 20% of their home country\u2019s GDP, or it is one of the three most important institutions in a Member State. \nCurrently, there are 123 institutions under the direct supervision of the ECB, which represents almost 82% of the BU \ncredit institutions\u2019 assets. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\nfact, some supervisory tasks will remain an exclusive responsibility of the national \n\nsupervisors, like consumers protection, the supervision of payments services and \n\ndaily verifications. \n\nThis integration between the ECB and NCAs not only avoids duplication of work \n\nbut it also allows the exploitation of the best of both institutions: the ECB\u2019s highly \n\nqualified and specialized human resources and the NCAs\u2019 knowledge of the \n\njurisdiction, cultural and organizational characteristics and better understanding of \n\nthe internal banking sector.  \n\nThe SSM harmonizes the levels of minimum supervision across the BU, yet the \n\nsupervision of each bank is proportional to its systemic importance, complexity and \n\nrisks.  It is the supervisors\u2019 function \u2013 whether it is the ECB or the NCA - to perform \n\nstress tests to institutions assessing their capability of enduring difficult periods, to \n\nverify the compliance with the capital requirements, to analyse their systemic risk \n\nand the strength of their governance. \n\nLastly, it is important to mention that considering the possible conflicts of \n\ninterests that could arise within the ECB from concentrating monetary policy and \n\nsupervision duties - as they both influence the interest rate-, the two responsibilities \n\nwere separated and made autonomous. The ECB is also independent from any \n\nnational government, any NCA or market participant, and it only answers to the \n\nEuropean Parliament (EP) and to the European Council. This enables a consistent \n\nand unbiased supervision and enforcement of the rules, ensuring the soundness of \n\ninstitutions across the BU. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n3.2.1.1. Capital Requirements Directives and Regulation (CRD \n\nIV and CRR)27  \n\nThe CRD IV and CRR aim to prevent the failure of banks and investment firms \n\nacross the BU by making them more resilient. \n\nBecause of the very nature of the banking activity, credit institutions are \n\npredisposed to be leveraged which is not considered a problem provided that \n\ninstitutions insure credit sustainability. However the financial crisis revealed that \n\nbanks did not managed their credits in a sustainable way, since they kept on \n\nincreasing their assets without holding sufficient capital \u2013 in quantity and in quality \n\n- capable of absorbing losses. This revealed insufficient preventive regulation, \n\nsupervision and transparency of the sector at a global scale. \n\nTo prevent future crisis, it is vital that institutions understand the risks they are \n\nincurring, anticipate possible stress periods and retain enough capital to survive \n\nthem. So the CRD IV and the CRR were created to harmonise \u201cthe quality and the \n\nlevel of the (credit institutions\u2019) capital base, the availability of the capital base,  \n\nliquidity  management  and  the  effectiveness  of  their  internal  and  corporate \n\ngovernance\u201d in the BU (The European Commission, 2013d). \n\nHowever, it is important that these regulations are imposed not only in the BU \n\nbut in banks around the world in order to reduce competitive disadvantages and \n\nprevent regulatory arbitrage that may cause countries with less requirements to be \n\nmore risk taking. This is the reason why the CRD IV and the CRR are based on the \n\nBasel III, from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 28 , a \n\n\u201ccomprehensive reform package\u2026 (that) aims to improve risk management and \n\n                                                \n27  This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/13/690 - Capital Requirements - CRD IV/CRR \u2013 \nFrequently Asked Questions (The European Commission, 2013d). \n28 \u201cThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory \nmatters. Its objective is to enhance understanding of key supervisory issues and improve the quality of banking \nsupervision worldwide. The Committee's members come from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, \nEuropean Union, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the \nNetherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom \nand the United States\u201d (Bank for International Settlements, 2016) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n\ngovernance as well as strengthen banks\u2019 transparency and disclosures\u201d, across all \n\nof its international members (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010) . \n\nThis new set of rules is divided into a directive and a regulation. They differ from \n\none another since the regulation has immediate effects in all Member States, while \n\nthe directive still has to be transposed to the national law and may be subject to \n\nchanges. Hence, the regulation avoids legal inconsistencies within the Single \n\nMarket, increasing transparency and removing legal uncertainty. \n\nThe CRD IV and CRR have two pillars. Pillar 1 quantifies the ratios of own funds \n\nan institution must retain according to its risk profile. Pillar 2 establishes that \n\ninstitutions themselves must assess their own capital needs. That assessment must \n\nbe reviewed by regulators that can discretionally demand additional capital \n\nrequirements if they consider necessary. Basel III also features Pillar 3 that involves \n\na disclosure framework that institutions must fulfil to increase transparency in the \n\nsector. The main goal of the latter pillar is to allow investors to properly price these \n\ninstitutions in the market. \n\nPillar 1 (capital, liquidity and leverage requirements) is contemplated in the CRR \n\ndue to importance of harmonizing the required levels. On the other hand, Pillar 2 \n\n(supervision, capital buffers, corporate governance and sanctions) is contemplated \n\non CRD because of its discretionary nature \u201cthe links with national administrative \n\nlaws are particularly important\u201d in these matters (The European Commission, \n\n2013d). \n\nIt is important to mention that Pillar 1 eliminates any discretions from Member \n\nStates, to level the banking ground in the EU. However, under Pillar 2, Member \n\nStates can increase the requirements in justifiable cases to cover for other risks, but \n\ncan never decrease the requirements set in the first pillar. \n\nInstitutions are also allowed to hold additional amount of capital, as they wish.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n33 \n\nPILLAR 1 \n\n- Capital requirements \n\nRegulatory capital is the amount of capital an institution is required to hold \n\ncompared to the amount of assets, to cover for unexpected losses. In the CRR, this \n\nis called \u201cown funds requirement\u201d and is expressed as a percentage of risk weighted \n\nassets 29 . In this sense, capital ratio can increase either by increasing the capital \n\nthrough recapitalization or by reducing at least one of the components of the RWAs \n\n\u2013 either the value of the assets or their perceived risk (see figure 1). \n\nThe requirements for this regulatory capital are very restrictive and only capital \n\nthat is permanently available to absorb losses is qualified (The European \n\nCommission, 2013d). Therefore assets like goodwill, deferred tax assets, defined \n\nbenefit pension fund assets and own shares must not be considered as regulatory \n\ncapital since their value may be subject to changes during stressed circumstances.  \n\nBoth the CRR and Basel III share the same definition and requirements of capital \n\nas to internationally harmonize rules.  \n\nThere are three different layers of capital defined in the CRR/Basel III. Their \n\nconstitution and ratios are comprised as follows30 (see figure 2): \n\n? Tier 1 Capital \u2013 must be at least 6% of risk-weighted assets at all times. \n\n? Common Equity Tier 1 \u2013 this tier is constituted by eligible capital, share \n\npremium, eligible reserves and positive retained earnings. To these \n\nelements is deducted the Goodwill, intangible assets, deferred taxes, \n\nminority interests, provisions and negative earnings. The CET1 capital \n\nmust be at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets at all times.  \n\n? Additional Equity Tier 1 \u2013 this tier mainly includes eligible instruments \n\nissued by the institution that were not included in the CET 1 capital, \n\n                                                \n29 The value of the perceived risk of an asset. \n30  This work did not extensively described each tier composition as that was not its main purpose. To better \ncomprehend the constitution of each tier read (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n\nsuch as preferred shares and hybrid instruments accounted for as \n\nequity. The Additional Tier 1 capital must be at least 1.5% of risk-\n\nweighted assets at all times. \n\n? Tier 2 Capital \u2013 this tier mostly includes eligible subordinated debt and it \n\nmust be at least 2% of risk-weighted assets at all times. \n\n \n\nThus Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) must be at least 8.0% of \n\nrisk-weighted assets at all times (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010). \n\nAs a rapid increase in capital requirements would affect the amount of loans and \n\ninvestments channelled from banks to the economy, conditioning economic growth, \n\nthe conformity with these new rules will be phased-out from 1 January 2014 until \n\n2022. This extended transition period will allow credit institutions to gradually \n\ncomply in an organic way (The European Commission, 2013d). \n\n \n\n- Liquidity requirements \n\nAs formerly mentioned, due to the nature of their business, banks face liquidity \n\nshortage. However, to own assets that may be easily converted into cash without \n\nany material loss (Whittlesey, 1945) is important to ensure banks\u2019 stability. \n\nThus, the regulatory framework introduces two new liquidity ratios that function \n\nas a quantitative standard measure for liquidity buffers: the Liquidity Coverage \n\nRequirement (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Requirement (NSFR).  \n\nThe LCR aims at improving the short-term (over a thirty day period) resilience \n\nof the liquidity risk profile of financial institutions, while the NSFR purpose is to \n\nensure that an institution has an acceptable amount of stable funding to support the \n\ninstitutions assets and activities over the medium term (over a one year period).  \n\nBecause these are new requirements, authorities set an observation period to \n\nproperly calibrate the target values of the ratios as to maximize their effectiveness \n\nand minimize negative consequences that they can cause to the real economy. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\nThese negative impacts to the economy occur via decrease of loans and \n\ninvestments provided as banks try to gather enough liquidity. \n\n \n\n- Leverage requirements31 \n\nThe required leverage ratio corresponds to the proportion of Tier 1 capital a bank \n\nowns over a measure of non-risk weighted items. If this ratio is considerably low it \n\nmeans that the institution has been financing its assets through debt and thus is \n\nhighly leveraged. \n\nBy setting a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio, authorities wish to limit the degree \n\nto which a bank is leveraging its capital base. Therefore, this measure aims at \n\nreducing excessive leverage to finance credits and also to level capital with the \n\nriskiness of the institutions\u2019 assets. \n\nHowever, like the liquidity requirements, the leverage ratio is a new regulatory \n\ntool in the EU that, due to lack of information about its effectiveness and the \n\nconsequences to the economy, was established under the Pillar 2, for discretionary \n\nuse of authorities and institutions, while more information is being gathered. \n\n \n\nPILLAR 2 \n\n- Capital buffers \n\nThe CRR establishes five mandatory capital buffers that must be constituted after \n\nthe basic requirements are assured: \n\n? Capital conservation buffer \n\nInstitutions must retain, in the form of CET1 capital 2.5% of the total of their \n\nexposures as a capital buffer. This buffer also contemplates increasing capital \n\ndistribution constraints (dividend and bonus payments) as banks experience losses \n\nand fall behind the 7% minimum CET1 capital requirements. This strategy requires \n\n                                                \n31 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/14/580 - Leverage Ratio Delegated Act: Frequently Asked \nQuestions (The European Commission, 2014f). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n\ninstitutions to hold more quality capital and, during periods of stress, prevents \n\nthem from worsening their balance sheets by distributing capital.  \n\n? Countercyclical buffer \n\nBuffers tend to be countercyclical \u2013 when the cycle is good banks should put aside \n\ncapital so that when there is an economic downturn those savings can be drained. \n\nThis buffer is specifically designed to take into account the macroeconomic \n\nfactors with the purpose of stabilizing credit supply. This means that when the cycle \n\nis virtuous, credit institutions must constitute this buffer thus restraining the \n\navailability of credit and preventing it from becoming too cheap and creating a \n\nbubble. Inversely, when the cycle turns, banks are allowed to use the buffer whether \n\nit is to absorb losses or to continue lending to the real economy. \n\nThe exact buffer rate will be calculated by NCAs based on a credit-to\u2013GDP \n\nindicator. A Member State can require this buffer to be up to 2.5% of RWA, \n\nproportionately to the credit growth and the build-up of its risks. \n\nThis buffer, like the capital conservation buffer, contemplates increasing capital \n\ndistribution constraints if institutions are unable to fulfil the requirements.  \n\n \n\n? Global systemic institution buffer \n\nThis buffer started taking effect in 1 January 2016 and it is mandatory to banks \n\nappointed by the responsible authorities as of global systemic importance. The goal \n\nof this buffer is to decrease moral hazard from these institutions that may consider \n\nthemselves \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. The criteria to be considered systemically important \n\nincludes size, cross border activities and interconnectedness - institutions that fulfil \n\nthese standards are required to hold between 1% and 3.5% CET1 of RWAs. The \n\nFinancial Stability Board\u2019s provisional list of 28 G-SIFIs (global systemically \n\nimportant financial institutions) includes 14 EU institutions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n\n? Other systemically important institutions buffer \n\nThis is an optional surcharge \u2013up to 2% of RWAs - which NCAs may demand to \n\nimportant domestic institutions. This buffer started taking effect in 1 January 2016 \n\nand must be fulfilled by CET1 capital. \n\n? Systemic risk buffer \n\nThis is an optional buffer of CET1 Member States may introduce to some or to all \n\nnational financial institutions to cover structural or systemic risks. Buffer rates until \n\n3% can be freely implemented, however for rates between 3% and 5 % Member \n\nStates must notify the Commission, the EBA, and the ESRB and above the 5% \n\nthreshold Member States need the approval of the Commission. \n\n \n\n- Corporate Governance  \n\nThe directive aims \u201cat increasing the effectiveness of risk oversight by Boards\u201d \n\n(The European Commission, 2013d) by incentivizing diversity in its constitution \n\nthus avoiding \u201cgroup thinking\u201d, improve risk management and supervision. \n\nFirst, institutions should have diversity in the board - different opinions and \n\nbackgrounds to avoid group thinking, achieve higher risk oversight. Secondly, \n\nremuneration of professional risk takers32 should be designed as to diminish the \n\nincentives to excessive risk taking. The CRD structured some requirements like \n\nmore than half of the variable remuneration should be given in equity-linked or \n\nother non-cash instruments and that the variable component of the total \n\nremuneration cannot exceed 100% of the fixed component and also a substantial \n\nportion of the variable remuneration component - at least 40% to 60% - should be \n\ndeferred from three to five years. \n\nIn addition, institutions are obliged to disclose their remuneration policy and \n\npractices for professional risk takers. \n\n                                                \n32 Staff whose professional activity has a material impact in the i nstitution\u2019s risk profile, like senior managers, risk \ntakers or staff engaged in control functions. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n\n- Ratings \n\nCapital requirements are calculated based on a percentage of the risk-weighted \n\nassets, however it is important to understand how the risk is perceived. A rating is \n\nattributed to the banks\u2019 assets according to their perceived risk. This ranking can be \n\nassigned by a specialized institution (credit rating agencies - CRA\u2019s) or by the bank \n\nitself. \n\nThe problem of using CRA\u2019s ratings is that banks do not fully understand the \n\nrisks of a certain asset, which can cause them to be more risk taking. Also, banks\u2019 \n\ndependency of these agencies is not desirable because CRA\u2019s can make mistakes, as \n\nit happened in the market of securities in 2007. \n\nTherefore, the Commission found benefits in the reduction of the dependence on \n\nthese external credit ratings, and is now requiring financial institutions to also \n\nassess their own assets instead of fully outsource that judgement. It is \n\nunderstandable that this procedure demands many resources so the new legislation \n\nonly requires internal credit assessment when possible and especially in portfolios \n\nthat are more exposed to risk. In case the internal assessment is more negative than \n\nthe CARs\u2019, institutions are forced to hold additional capital. \n\n3.2.1.2. Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS)33  \n\nThe Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS) was first issued in 1994, even \n\nthough the level of deposit coverage has increased to a uniform amount of 100.000\u20ac, \n\nin 2010. This directive ensures that every Member State has a national DGS with the \n\nmain objective of guaranteeing depositors\u2019 protection as a way of preventing \u201cbank \n\nruns\u201d, possible contagion to other financial institutions and general distrust in the \n\nsystem. \n\n                                                \n33 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/14/296 - Deposit Guarantee Schemes \u2013 Frequently Asked \nQuestions (The European Commission, 2014d) and on the European Commission MEMO/15/6153 - A European \nDeposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions (The European Commission, 2015). \n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/guarantee/index_en.htm\n\n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n\nIn case a bank fails, each DGS safeguards 100.000 \u20ac of the aggregated accounts of \n\na depositor, per bank. All individuals and enterprises are covered by the DGS, but \n\nnot financial institutions and national authorities. Deposits in other currencies are \n\nalso covered. \n\nOn 24 November 2015, as a way of further weakening the link between banks \n\nand their national sovereigns and to increase trust in the system regardless of the \n\nbank\u2019s location within the Union, the EC proposed the creation of the BU\u2019s third \n\npillar, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) (The European Commission, \n\n2015). \n\nAccording to the Commission\u2019s legislative proposal, the objective is to replace \n\nthe national Deposits Guarantee Schemes, which can be vulnerable to local shocks, \n\nby a European level fund that is able to provide a uniform degree of insurance \n\ncoverage. \n\nThe EDIS will be managed by the Single Resolution and Deposits Insurance \n\nBoard34 and the European Deposit Insurance Fund (EDIF) will be established in \n\nthree phases. During the first three years of the fund, if a bank fails, the national \n\nDGS has to first exhaust all its funds before the EDIS can provide any support. In \n\nthe second phase, which lasts four years, the national scheme does not have to be \n\nexhausted before it is able to access the EDIS, which will progressively support the \n\nresolution with larger shares of capital. After those seven years, the EDIS will fully \n\ninsure deposits and would cover all liquidity needs and losses in the event of a pay-\n\nout or resolution procedure. \n\nThe EDIF will be financed beforehand by the European banking sector, with the \n\ntarget of 0.8% of the covered deposits in the EU (approximately \u20ac 43 billion), that \n\nshould be fully collected by 2024. However, in case of disbursements from the fund \n\n                                                \n34 \u201cIn the Commission's proposal, this role would be played by the existing Single Resolution Board (SRB), wi th an \nappropriately modified governance structure for its new DGS tasks. The Board would administer the Single \nResolution Fund (SRF) and the European Deposit Insurance Fund together, thereby creating synergies when \ncombining responsibilities for resolution and deposit insurance.\u201d (The European Commission, 2015) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n\nbefore that target is met, banks may be required to make extraordinary \n\ncontributions or there may have to be an extension of the gathering period for four \n\nmore years. These extensions will be carefully computed due to pro-cyclicality and \n\ndeterioration of banks\u2019 situation. \n\nEach bank will contribute directly to the fund in proportion to its risk exposure, \n\nas banks that accept more risk are more likely to fail and thus to activate the fund. \n\nThe fund detained by the EDIS is not allowed to be used in the recovery process, \n\nas it is still unknown whether the institution will endure, and, in case it fails, the \n\nEDIS would still have to repay depositors. However they can be applied in the \n\nresolution procedures since the EDIS and the Single Resolution Mechanism share \n\none common goal: to ensure the vital functions of the institution, such as payment \n\nsystems and deposit availability. Yet, the Deposit Insurance Fund can only be used \n\nto resolve a bank when the costs of filling the money gap are less than paying out \n\nall the ensured deposits. \n\n3.2.2. Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)35   \n\nWhile the idea behind the SSM is to prevent bank failure, the SRM, as the second \n\npillar of the BU, is triggered when banks are already facing difficulties. \n\nThis mechanism represents the central institution responsible for applying the \n\nBank Recover and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the legal framework in force \n\nwhenever a bank needs to be recovered or has already past the point when recovery \n\nis possible and resolution is the solution that maximizes society\u2019s welfare. Hence, \n\nthe SRM assures a uniform recovery and resolution procedure that facilitates both \n\nprocesses, minimizing costs for taxpayers and to the real economy. \n\n                                                \n35 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/14/295 - A Single Resolution Mechanism for the Banking \nUnion \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions (The European Commission, 2014f) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n\nThe mechanism relies on a fund \u2013 Single Resolution Fund (SRF) - administrated \n\nby a board \u2013 Single Resolution Board (SRB). Both elements are financed through \n\ntwo different contribution channels by banks in the Banking Union (European \n\nCommission, 2014f). \n\nThe SRM started being applied in 1 January 2015. However the bail-in resolution \n\ntool, explained in Chapter 4, only began applying to all outstanding and newly issue \n\ndebt in 1 January 2016 (The European Commission, 2014f). \n\n3.2.2.1. The Single Resolution Fund (SRF) \n\nThe SRF will be gathered through the contribution of all banks in the BU, and to \n\nguarantee that these contributions do not have a negative impact on banks\u2019 lending \n\ncapacity to the real economy, they are being collected gradually, over a period of 8 \n\nyears, from 1 January 2016 until 2024. \n\nSimilarly to the EDIF, the planned target of the fund is about 1% of the covered \n\ndeposits of the Union, which, should amount approximately to \u20ac55 billion (The \n\nEuropean Commission, 2014e). Thus, every year, the collective contributions should \n\nbe around \u20ac6.8 billion (12.5% of the target level), but the fee is not equal between \n\nbanks of the Union. Instead, the payments made by banks are proportional to the \n\nrisk profile of the institution (The European Commission, 2014f). \n\nNonetheless, these conditions may change as the banking industry evolves \u2013 if \n\nthe value of the secured deposits grows so will the target value of the fund and thus \n\nof the contributions. Also, the fees for the fund may be extended for four more years, \n\nto a twelve years total, if eventual disbursements needed exceed half of the target \n\nsize of the fund (The European Commission, 2014e). Furthermore, the managers of \n\nthe fund reserve the right to demand additional financing, whether from the market \n\nor from the very banking industry. \n\nThe SRB can allow the use of funds from the SRF but simply to cover up to 5% of \n\nthe losses and only after bank\u2019s shareholders and creditors have lost at least 8% of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n\ntheir liabilities. And if, in case of an extraordinary event, these funds are not enough \n\nto cover the resolution, banks may resort to public support limited by the applicable \n\nrules on EU State aid (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 27, paragraph 7) (The European \n\nCommission, 2014e). \n\nBesides, the resolution fund cannot be used to recapitalise the failing institution, \n\n\u201cthe main use of the resolution funds will be limited to, for example, providing \n\nloans to a bridge institution, purchasing specific assets of an institution under \n\nresolution, guarantee certain assets or liabilities of the institution under resolution, \n\nor in exceptional circumstances \u2013 as mentioned above - contributing to loss \n\nabsorption by replacing creditors who would have been bailed in\u201d (The European \n\nCommission, 2014e). \n\n3.2.2.2. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)36 \n\nThe first principle of the BRRD is prevention and preparation - banks and \n\nauthorities across the BU must be prepared for a possible crisis by having the means \n\nto quickly address early stage problems. To that end, all banks are required to \n\nprepare a recovery and resolution plan to deal with difficult times. \n\nThe second principle of the directive consist in early intervention (recovery) of \n\nthe institution and, in case that fails, its resolution. \n\nEarly intervention \u2013 the process of recovery \n\nWhen an institution demonstrates the first signs of difficulties, such as a capital \n\nshortfall, a recovery and restructuring plan must be created and executed to \n\nguarantee the stability of the financial system. To implement the plan, a temporary \n\nadministrator could be nominated to assist or replace the management executive. \n\n                                                \n36 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/14/297 - EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive \n(BRRD): Frequently Asked Questions (The European Commission, 2014e) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n43 \n\nThe initial recovery actions aim to recapitalize the institution, increase cash \n\navailability and decrease risk exposure. These actions may include \u201crights issues, a \n\nvoluntary conversion of subordinated debt instruments into equity on the basis of \n\na risk-related incentive, liability management exercises37 which should in principle \n\nbe 100% capital generating, sales of capital-generating assets and portfolios, \n\nsecuritisation of portfolios in order to generate capital from non-core activities, or \n\nan earnings retention\u201d (The European Commission, 2014e). \n\nThe mentioned measures all come from the company itself or from the private \n\nsector. Recovery must first be financed by these means before any recapitalization \n\ncan come from the write-down of shareholders, subordinated creditors or, as a last \n\nresort to cover the residual capital shortfall, from the public sector. Early \n\ninterventions never require the contribution of senior debtholders, such as \n\ndepositors. \n\n \n\nResolution of the institution \n\nAs previously mentioned, the BRRD offers a standardized path to deal with \n\nfailing banks. \n\nIn principle, fulfilling its role as supervisor, the ECB will be the first to detect a \n\nfailing bank and to decide to resolve it. The Central Bank will immediately report \n\nthe situation to the SRB that will decide the best course of action and prepare the \n\nresolution process. National authorities will also be involved in the decision and \n\nimplementation process because they have a better understanding of the national \n\njurisdiction and of the internal banking sector dynamics. \n\nThe resolution process is initiated when it is the authorities\u2019 belief that despite \n\nthe institution\u2019s attempts to recover in an admissible timeframe they have proven \n\n                                                \n37 Activities that allow the institution to better adjust its level of debt, granting that the amount of assets remains \nabove the amount of liabilities. These activities include deleveraging, debt restructuring \u2013 extensions on the \ndebt terms and renegotiations of the interest rates-, bond redemptions or buybacks, debt equity swaps, and so \non. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\nto be insufficient and the company is still failing (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 18). \n\nTherefore, actions to diminish the negative consequences of a bank failure must be \n\ntaken.  \n\nYet, the resolution of a bank is a tool that must be used as a last resort because of \n\nthe distortions it will cause in the economy. Authorities facing this decision have to \n\nchoose the perfect moment to intervene because they do not want to interfere so \n\nsoon as to create panic and so late that the resolution will not be efficient. \n\nWhereas in a solvency procedure of a regular company the main goal is to \n\nminimize the creditors\u2019 losses, which can take years to solve, in a bank\u2019s resolution \n\nprocess, due to the very essence of its industry, the goal is to have a rushed process \n\nwhich minimizes contagion, instability and losses for society. Therefore, this \n\nmechanism is designed to allow decisions to be taken quickly and efficiently, so that \n\nin 32 hours, usually over the weekend, the process is concluded, reducing the \n\ndistortions to the economy.  \n\nThe ideal resolution of a bank is the one that safeguards vital banking operations \n\n(such as payment systems), protects depositors, client assets and public funds, at \n\nthe same time it minimizes financial instability and destruction of value. Resolution \n\nauthorities must take into consideration the purposes of the resolution, the balance \n\nsheet of the institution, its value, importance and the time available for the \n\nprocedure as to choose the tool that better fits the situation (EU Regulation, 2014, \n\nArticles 14 and 22). \n\nThere are four resolution tools (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 22). The first and the \n\none that causes less distortion to the financial stability, is to sell all or any part of the \n\nbank to a purchaser from the private sector that is not a bridge institution \u2013 sale of \n\nbusiness tool-, regardless of the shareholders consent (EU Regulation, 2014, Article \n\n24). Although preferable, this situation is only feasible if there are interested buyers. \n\nAn example of this strategy is the acquisition of the failing NetBank by the ING \n\nGroup, in 2007.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n\nThe second option is the bridge bank institution tool that consists in creating a \n\nbridge bank that absorbs all the essential functions of the bank while the institution \n\nis either liquidated or sold. The bridge bank is then eventually sold to the private \n\nsector (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 25). This strategy is usually preferred by the \n\nshareholders and debtholders because it allows a normal prolonged solvency \n\nprocess without affecting the general public. \n\nThirdly, the asset separation tool consist in to transfer assets, rights and/or \n\nliabilities of an institution under resolution or a bridge institution to one or more \n\nasset management vehicles. Usually, this procedure involves dividing the failing \n\ninstitution into two separated ones \u2013- , the \u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cbad\u201d bank. The \u201cgood\u201d \n\nbank would hold all of the clean assets while the other would retain all the toxic \n\nones (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 26). This was the resolution applied in the \n\nPortuguese Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, which was split into the \u201cgood\u201d bank - Novo \n\nBanco -, and the \u201cbad\u201d one which holds the initial name38. \n\nFinally, the fourth tool is the bail-in of creditors which started being enforced in \n\n1 January 2016 and it is going to be described in the next chapter.  \n\n                                                \n38 \u201cWhere the resolution tools have been used to transfer the systemically important services or viable business of an \nentity to a sound entity such as a private sector purchaser or bridge entity, the residual part of the entity should be \nliquidated\u201d (EU Regulation, 2014, Paragraph 66). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4. The bail-in resolution tool \n\n4.1. The legal framework \n\n \u201cAn effective resolution regime should minimise the costs of the resolution of a \n\nfailing entity borne by the taxpayers\u201d (EU Regulation, 2014, Paragraph 73), through \n\nthe allocation of those costs to the institutions\u2019 investors. Bail-in is the mechanism \n\nused for the exercise of the write-down and conversion of liabilities of an institution \n\nunder resolution (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 3, Paragraph 33). Therefore, losses \n\nare allocated to investors through the application of the bail-in tool. \n\nThis tool is applicable in any resolution procedure, either the objective is to \n\nresolve the failing entity as a going concern, or to transfer systemically important \n\nservices to a bridge entity or even to divide the institution under the asset separation \n\ntool framework. Therefore, the writing down and conversion of relevant capital \n\ninstruments can be made on a stand-alone basis 39  or together with any of the \n\nremaining resolution tools (EU Regulation, 2014, Paragraph 74, Article 21 and 27). \n\nIt is important to distinguish this resolution tool from contingent capital. Even \n\nthough they appear similar, the latter is a security investors can purchase that is \n\nimmediately converted into equity when the bank reaches a certain trigger40. While \n\n                                                \n39  However, this tool can only be applied on a stand-alone basis if there are strong reasons to believe that its \napplication, combined with other measures such as business reorganization, restores the entity to financial soundness \nand long-term viability. Any of the remaining resolution tools shall apply, as appropriate, when these conditions are \nnot met. (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 27, paragraph 2) \n40 Usually the trigger is a standardized dangerously low level of capital base. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n\nthe bail-in consists in a mandatory conversion of the credit institution\u2019s liabilities in \n\nan amount equal to its losses, applied by the resolution authorities when the \n\ninstitution is falling (Conlon &amp; Cotter, 2014) \n\nWhen the bail-in procedure applies, the write-down or conversion must follow a \n\ncertain order (EU Regulation, 2014, Paragraph 77, Article 17 and 21). Creditors of \n\nthe institution under resolution bear losses after the shareholders in accordance \n\nwith the reverse order of priority of their claims: first any contractual contingent \n\ncapital instruments, then subordinated debt, and finally unsecured senior debt. \n\nAlso creditors of the same class are treated in an equitable manner.  \n\nThe write-down or conversion will not apply to insured deposits, liabilities \n\nbacked by assets or collateral, liabilities such as salaries, pensions or taxes or short-\n\nterm inter-bank lending. And, in case there is a need to write-down or convert \n\nuninsured depositors (deposits above the coverage level of 100.000\u20ac), depositors \n\npreference will be applied for deposits held by natural persons and small and \n\nmedium enterprises (SME). \n\nDespite all, the resolution process obeys to the \u201cno creditor worse off\u201d principle \n\nwhich postulates that no creditor \u201cshould be worse off under resolution than it \n\nwould have been had the bank been wound up under applicable insolvency law \n\nproceedings\u201d (European Commission, 2014e). Besides, individuals and enterprises \n\nthat perceive the written-down of their assets as an illegal decision may, through \n\nlegal proceedings, require compensation for damages. \n\n4.2. The benefits and disadvantages \n\nBesides the advantages already mentioned as reasons why the EC has decided to \n\nenforce the bail-in tool, like to end the negative cycle between banks and their \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n49 \n\nsovereigns and to dissolve the moral hazard of companies that believe that they are \n\n\u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, there are more benefits. \n\nThe bail-in tool incentivizes investors\u2019 supervision of the bank\u2019s activities since \n\nnow they are directly affected by the entity\u2019s behaviour. So, it is expected that these \n\ninstitutions become more disciplined and more moderated when taking risks and \n\nincreasing their leverage, making them more resilient, increasing the financial \n\nstability which in turn will result in a positive impact for society. \n\nHowever, this tool also has disadvantages that cannot be overlooked. As \n\ninvestors perceive that it is now riskier to finance credit institutions it is expected \n\nthat banks\u2019 cost of funding will increase by 4.7-15 basis points while non-financial \n\nfirms\u2019 cost of capital should increase by 3.29-10.5 bp (The European Commission, \n\n2012). \n\nYet, even though individuals and SME should expect an increase in their funding \n\ncosts which tends to lead to the reduction of investment, consumption and so of the \n\neconomic growth (Zhou, J., 2012)., the European Commission states that this should \n\nbe seen as a sign of the effectiveness of the reforms that will lead to a safer, more \n\ntransparent and stable financial system (The European Commission, 2014a). \n\nAnother inconvenience of the tool is that all the mentioned reforms may lead to \n\nan increase in regulatory arbitrage - finding legal ways to get around restrictions \n\nimposed by laws (Gup, 2011, pp 44). In this way, credit institutions may be \n\npreparing themselves to restructure their balance sheets as to prevent their \n\nliabilities from being eligible to be subjected to the bail-in tool, reducing the \n\neffectiveness of this measure. \n\nSo credit institutions may shift from contracting senior debt, which is now more \n\nexpensive, to hire short-term and secured borrowing at a lower funding cost, thus \n\nreducing the amount of liabilities eligible for write-down or conversion in the bail-\n\nin process, which may cause the bail-in to be insufficient to restore the institution \n\nback to being profitable (Zhou, J., 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n\nFor this reason, the EC is already working on the implementation of the \n\nminimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), expressed as \n\na percentage of the total liabilities and own funds of the entity, as a way to ensure \n\nthat the bail-in tool will be effective.  (The European Commission, 2015). \n\nAnother problem with great expression is that this tool is not capable of offsetting \n\nthe contagion risk that arises from one struggling institution. In other words, when \n\nthe bail-in tool is applied in one bank, the write-down of its liabilities will cause \n\nlosses to other financial institutions that are debtholders of the failed one. This \n\nsuggest that the bail-in of one institution may end up shifting risk to other parts of \n\nthe financial sector. Thus, authorities must be aware of the potential effects on the \n\nbalance sheets of other banks when applying the bail-in resolution (Zhou, J., 2012).. \n\nThe final issue with this tool is the ambiguity of the conditions that trigger the \n\nresolution. Although the SRM discloses some qualitative guidance regarding when \n\ninstitutions should be resolved it lacks explicit quantitative measures. This situation \n\ncauses uncertainty to investors, which may require higher funding costs to cover \n\nthe risk, and allows discretion for regulators, leading to legal inconsistencies. \n\nThis matter could be solved with the creation of a trigger linked to the entity\u2019s \n\nbalance sheet ratios, like those applied in contingent capital. This would increase \n\ntransparency and predictability in the procedure and avoid the risk of only applying \n\nthe resolution when the institution is already insolvent (Zhou, J., 2012). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5. The bail-in of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo \n\n5.1. What happened to BES?41 \n\nWith more than 145 years Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo (BES) had over 2 million clients \n\nand ten thousand employees across Portugal and twenty other countries. It was the \n\nthird largest bank in Portugal with a considerable market share and especial focus \n\non the institutional financial sector42.  \n\nThe institution\u2019s shares were traded at NYSE Euronext Lisbon and its supervisor \n\nwas Banco de Portugal. The products and services it provided included deposit-\n\ntaking, lending to the private sector, management of investment funds, brokerage \n\nservices, investment banking services and the selling of life and non-life insurances. \n\nBesides that, it conducted investments of short, medium and long term in the \n\nfinancial and foreign exchange markets as a way to take advantage of price \n\nfluctuations or to have a return on the available financial resources. \n\nBES was part of a group, GBES (Grupo Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo), which in turn is \n\nheld by a much bigger group, GES (Grupo Espir\u00edto Santo). While the holding GBES \n\nis only constituted by financial institutions, GES also sustains companies in \n\n                                                \n41 This section is based on (Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, S.A., 2014) and (Saraiva, 2015). \n42 Regarding to credit to SME BES had a 19% market share in Portugal. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n52 \n\ndiversified businesses - health, tourism, Real Estate, energy, construction, mining \n\nand others. \n\nThe links inside GES are complex and highly intricate (see figure 3), with \n\ncompanies located in different countries and subject to different legislations thus \n\nhindering supervision and allowing financial reporting discretion. The excessive \n\nexposure of BES to its group was the main cause of its failure (see Table 3). \n\nOn 30 July 2014, BES presented the first semester\u2019s financial statements where it \n\ndisclosed losses of 3.577 Mil \u20ac. This was an unexpected situation since on 10 July the \n\nbank informed its stakeholders that it estimated losses on the order of 1.500 Mil \u20ac, \n\nthat would be completely offset by its 2.100 Mil \u20ac capital buffer and still allowing it \n\nto fulfil the capital requirements43. \n\nHowever the capital buffer was not sufficient to compensate the actual losses that \n\narose from specific and non-recurring events that occurred during the semester as \n\na result from the exposure of BES to its Group, GES. These exceptional events \n\nincluded the accounting of impairments44 and provisions45 in the amount of 4.253,5 \n\nMil \u20ac: 2.131 Mil \u20ac were constituted as credit provisions, 186 Mil \u20ac were considered \n\nas impairments due to losses in share titles, 94 Mil \u20ac due to losses in Real Estate, 25 \n\nMil \u20ac as losses in supplementary capital and 1.818 Mil \u20acas losses in other assets and \n\ncontingencies. If these events had not occurred the net income of the institution \n\nwould have been negative by 255.4 Mil \u20ac, which only represents a decrease of 7% \n\n(17.49 Mil \u20ac) comparing to the 2013\u2019s net income (see Table 4 and 5). \n\n                                                \n43 The results of BES reflected acts of harmful management and violations of levels set by BdP for exposure to its own \ngroup. After its failure the Portuguese Parliament opened a formal investigation to the executive of BES and GES. This \ninquiry was performed by Comiss\u00e3o Parlamentar de Inqu\u00e9rito, a committee composed by parliament deputies, who \ntried to uncover the real and accurate facts in an objective and non-partisan form. However, the purpose of this paper \nis not to find whether this case was or not a case of criminal management but rather to empirically apply the bail -in \nresolution tool. \n44 According to the financial report of the bank, an impairment is created when there is an objective evidence of an \nevent that has a negative impact on its recoverable amount and that amount can be reasonably estimated. \n45 According to the financial report of the bank, provisions are created when the Group has a legal liability, likely to \nbe executed and which the amount is able to be reasonably estimated. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n53 \n\nBesides that, GBES was highly exposed to its group\u2019s non-financial companies \n\n(the entities of GES not integrated on GBES) because of granted loans, guarantees46 \n\nand debt underwriting provided by GBES to GES. The problem was that these non-\n\nfinancial companies of GES were extremely weakened which forced the constitution \n\nof a 2 M\u20ac provision to safeguard the exposure in case of default.  \n\nThe elevated deficit caused BES\u2019 Common Equity Tier I to decrease to 5.1% (see \n\nTable 6), thus falling behind the capital requirements requested by the Portuguese \n\nCentral Bank (BdP) by 1.9 p.p.. Consequently, the day after the disclosure of BES\u2019 \n\nresults, the ECB informed BdP and BES that the bank was going to be suspended as \n\na counterpart of the Eurosystem, starting on 1 august 2014, due to lack of solvency. \n\nThis would have had as an immediate result the suspension of the bank\u2019s access to \n\nthe Eurosystem\u2019s liquidity and the mandatory return of a credit granted by the \n\nEurosystem to the institution, in the amount of 10.000 M\u20ac. In practical terms this \n\nmeant that, due to lack of solvency, the bank would have had to suspend its \n\nactivities and enter a liquidation process causing huge systemic risks and financial \n\ninstability. \n\nDespite that, the Portuguese Central Bank was able to postpone the suspension \n\nuntil 4 August under the condition of resolving the bank during the weekend, in \n\ntime for the markets\u2019 opening on Monday. Facing the possibility of one of the largest \n\nbanks in Portugal being liquidated, BdP had no other choice but to resolve BES. \n\nThe resolution measures considered by BdP were, by order, private \n\nrecapitalization, public recapitalization, nationalization, the application of one of \n\nthe resolution tools and finally liquidation47. \n\n                                                \n46 According to the financial report of the bank, financial guarantees are contracts that compel its issuer to compensate \nthe other part for losses incurred due to non-compliance of the contractual terms of debt instruments. \n47  It is important to underline that this resolution measure occurred in 2014 whereas the bail -in enforcement began in \nJanuary 2016. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n54 \n\nThe first plan, to recapitalize BES with private capital, was not feasible because \n\nwhen the difficult situation of BES was disclosed, the bank was unable to find \n\nprivate investors willing to either recapitalize it or acquire it. \n\nThe second and third options, injection of public funds or nationalization of the \n\nbank, required the intervention of the State. However, since the Crisis \n\nCommunication in 2013, any use of public funds to aid a financial institution in \n\ndistress is subject to the EC\u2019s approval and can only be applied in institutions that \n\ncan prove long term viability and providing that the principle of burden sharing is \n\nsatisfied. \n\nThus, these two possible resolutions where not feasible as the EC\u2019s approval \n\ncould not be obtained in the timeframe provided by the ECB for the resolution of \n\nBES, preventing the State from financing the bank. Besides, to provide financial aid \n\nwas never the Government\u2019s will for there were righter alternatives that would \n\nbetter safeguard the taxpayers given that the State had already assumed elevated \n\ncosts in previous bank resolutions. \n\nThe fifth option, liquidation, was going to occur either way with the suspension \n\nof BES as a counterpart of the Eurosystem. This would have had implied that the \n\nbank would have had to immediately interrupt its services and activities so that, \n\nthrough legal proceedings, all of the entity\u2019s assets would have been sold in order \n\nto satisfy its creditors. Usually these legal proceedings are long, highly costly and \n\ncause value destruction. Besides, the Deposits Guarantee Fund would have had to \n\nbe activated to safeguard depositors\u2019 money, which would have had increased the \n\ncosts borne by other financial institutions. This would have spread fear and \n\nuncertainty across the Portuguese banking sector, damaging the real economy.  \n\nThe fourth option included the use of one of the resolution tools covered in \n\nChapter 3 \u2013 sale of business, bridge bank institution and the asset separation tool. \n\nIn fact, BdP applied the asset separation tool which according to Carlos Costa, \n\nGovernor of BdP, in a hearing to the CPI, was not a destructive measure, but rather \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n55 \n\na way to preserve the financial stability, for that is the primary duty of BdP. The \n\nGovernor also stated that the adopted solution was the only capable of fixing the \n\nsituation in the short period of time given by the Eurosystem and at the same time \n\nprotect depositors, taxpayers and the financial system. \n\nThis resolution was one of the firsts of its kind in the European Union and it \n\ninvolved the creation of a new financial institution, Novo Banco, which would \n\nabsorb BES\u2019 non-toxic assets and liabilities that were not bounded to GES, allowing \n\nthe uninterrupted activity of its services and diminishing inconveniences for its \n\ncustomers. In the meantime, BES would enter a judicial liquidation process, \n\nremaining unable to carry out any banking activity, while all of its assets and \n\nliabilities, not transferred to Novo Banco, are executed. \n\nHowever, this resolution measure required both the intervention of the State and \n\nof the Resolution Fund because during the establishment of Novo Banco, BdP \n\nidentified a capital shortage of 4.900 Mil \u20ac. This deficiency would have to be covered \n\nby the Portuguese Resolution Fund, gathered by the national banking system, in its \n\nrole of financial sponsor of the resolution measures of credit institutions. Yet the \n\nFund had been opened in 2012 and it did not own the means to do so. \n\nTherefore, the Resolution Fund had to request two loans, one from the \n\nPortuguese government of 3.900 Mil \u20ac48 and another from a syndicate of eight banks \n\nin the amount of 700 Mil \u20ac - the remaining 300 Mil \u20ac would be set by the Fund. \n\nIn this sense, the Resolution Fund is the only capital owner of this new institution, \n\neven though the purpose is to restructure the shareholders\u2019 base with private \n\ninvestors and thus reimburse the Fund and consequently its lenders. \n\n  \n\n                                                \n48 Loan bearing interests to be amortized over maximum of two years. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n56 \n\n5.2. The bail-in exercise \n\nThe purpose of this exercise is to understand in practical terms how the bail-in is \n\napplied and which are the main differences between its application and the \n\nresolution procedure that was actually carried out. \n\nAll the data used in this exercise was retrieved from Bankscope49 and from the \n\ninstitution\u2019s financial report of the first semester of 2014 (Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, S.A., \n\n2014). The data collected follows the IFRS accounting regulations and represents the \n\nconsolidated statements of the entity thus reflecting assets, liabilities and income \n\nstatements of itself and of its subsidiaries50. The values are expressed in millions of \n\neuros, except when stated otherwise. \n\nSince there is no quantitative bail-in trigger defined yet by the competent \n\nauthorities, for the purpose of this analysis and with the data available, it is going \n\nto be used the entity\u2019s last balance sheet available from the first semester of 2014. \n\nThe methodology will be the subsequent: \n\n- This exercised was designed so that the debt write down would absorb all \n\nlosses (Loss Absorption) and the conversion into equity would recapitalize the \n\nentity, allowing it to continue as a going concern (Recapitalization); \n\n- The write-down or conversion was not applied to secured liabilities, \n\nliabilities backed by assets or collateral, liabilities such as salaries, pensions or taxes \n\nor short-term inter-bank lending; \n\n- The eligible liabilities for bail-in in the exercise are subordinated debt and the \n\nsenior debt; \n\n                                                \n49 https://bankscope.bvdinfo.com/version-201629/home.serv?product=scope2006  \n50 Entities controlled by the institution, meaning that is the Group is exposed to modifications in the report ed income \nof these institutions. \n\nhttps://bankscope.bvdinfo.com/version-201629/home.serv?product=scope2006\n\n\n \n\n \n\n57 \n\n- The write-down or conversion followed a sequential bail-in model instead of \n\na pro-rata one51; \n\n- The assets were considered stable and so were the risk-weighted assets; \n\n- The write-down and conversion was applied in accordance to the following \n\n(DG Internal Market, 2011): \n\n? Loss absorption (by order): \n\na)52 the principal amount of Additional Tier 1 instruments that are liabilities \n\nand Tier 2 instruments are written-down; \n\nb) 53  if the write-down in point (a) is less than the required amount, the \n\nprincipal amount of subordinated debt that is not Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 \n\ncapital is reduced to the extent required; \n\nc)54 if the total reduction of liabilities in points (a) and (b) is less than the \n\nrequired amount, the principal amount of senior debt is reduced to the extent \n\nrequired; \n\nd)55 if the total reduction of liabilities in points (a), (b) and (c) is less than the \n\nrequired amount, the Resolution Fund should cover the remaining. \n\n?  Recapitalization: \n\ne)56 Since the resolution fund cannot be used for recapitalization purposes \n\nof a failing institution, all the recapitalization burden will be allocated to the \n\ndebtholders. \n\n                                                \n51 The sequential bail-in implies that the same rank of investors is completely written-down before the next rank can \nexperience losses. The pro-rata bail-in model implies that losses are proportionally allocated to all the ranks eligible \nfor bail-in. \n52 The write-down of Additional Tier 1 liabilities and Tier 2 instruments in the exercise implied the write-off of all \nsubordinated debt eligible for Tier II capital. The amount of the write-off is deducted from the subordinated creditors \naccount and credited in the earnings account. \n53  The write-down of the principal amount of subordinated debt in the exercise implied the write-off of all \nsubordinated debt non-eligible for Tier II capital. The amount of the write-off is deducted from the subordinated \ncreditors account and credited in the earnings account.  \n54 The write-down of the principal amount of senior debt in the exercise implied a write-down of senior debt according \nto the assumption (H1, H2, H3). The amount of the write-down is deducted from the senior creditors account and \ncredited in the earnings account. \n55  The use of resources from the Resolution Fund to cover the remaining losses is accounted as a debit in the \ninstitution\u2019s deposit account and credited in the earnings account. \n56 The conversion of senior debt to other instruments is deducted from the senior creditors account and credited in the \nrespective account (pref. shares and hybrid capital accounted for as Equity and subordinated debt). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n58 \n\n The exercise was performed three times following three different assumptions \n\n(Table 1): \n\n- H1 \u2013 the bank\u2019s investors (subordinated debtholders and senior \ndebtholders) would have had to sustain all the losses and recapitalization \n\nexpenses; \n\n- H2 \u2013 the bank\u2019s investors would have had to sustain all recapitalization \nexpenses and the write-down of 8% of their assets, while the Resolution Fund \n\nwould have assumed the remaining losses; \n\n- H3 \u2013 the bank\u2019s investors would have had to sustain all recapitalization \nexpenses and half of the losses, while the Resolution Fund assumes the other half.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n59 \n\n  \nTable 1: The Bail-In sequence \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\n5.2.1. Loss absorption (LA) \n\nDuring the first semester of 2014, BES incurred in losses in the amount of 3.577 Mil \n\n\u20ac. The three hypothesis demonstrate possible solutions, following the procedures \n\npreviously mentioned, for the write-down of liabilities as to absorb this loss. \n\nIn H1, the bank\u2019s investors would have been forced to cover the entire loss. To this \n\nend, they would have needed to write-down 29% of their assets to cover for the entire \n\nloss. Subordinated debtors would have been completely written-off, whereas senior \n\ndebt holders would have been written-down by 23%. \n\nIn H2, investors would have been required to write-down only 8% of their assets \n\nwhich represents 28% of the total loss - subordinated debtors would have been \n\ncompletely written-off, whereas senior debt holders would have been written-down \n\nby 0.2%. The remaining 72% of the losses would have been allocated to the Resolution \n\nFund. \n\nIn fact, under the current framework of the SRM, the SRF is only able cover up to \n\n5% of the losses after the write-down of 8% of the eligible liabilities. However, the \n\nexercise was prepared like this to allow a straightforward comparison with the \n\nresolution that in fact occurred. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the resolution of BES required a recapitalization of 4.900 \n\nMil \u20ac, in NB, by the Portuguese Resolution Fund. If the original resolution would \n\nhave demanded the write-down of 8% of investors\u2019 assets, the fund would have had \n\nto inject in BES only 53% of what it actually did. \n\nBut to perform a more accurate analysis on the costs incurred by taxpayers it is \n\nimportant to examine the financing sources of the fund. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n61 \n\n   \n\nAs to achieve the 4.900 Mil \u20ac needed, the fund exhausted all of its funds (300 Mil \n\n\u20ac), requested a loan from a syndicate of eight national banks (700 Mil \u20ac) and another \n\nfrom the Portuguese Government (3.900 Mil \u20ac).  \n\nAssuming that the government was the final source of funding, it is possible to \n\nconclude that the Resolution Fund and the bank syndicate would have had the same \n\ncosts in H2 as they had in the original resolution. However the State would only have \n\nhad to lend 41% of the funds it actually lent. \n\nIn H3, both investors and the RF would have been liable for an equal amount of \n\nlosses. Here, investors would have been written-down by 14% of their assets - \n\nsubordinated debtors would have been completely written-off, whereas senior debt \n\nholders would have been written-down by 7% -, while the fund would have covered \n\nthe rest of the losses. \n\nAgain, under the current framework of the SRM, the SRF would only cover up to \n\n5% of the losses. However it is possible to conclude that had this been the resolution \n\nprocess chosen investors would have sustained half of the losses and the Resolution \n\nFund would have only financed 37% of what it actually did. \n\nTable 2: The Bail-In effects on the external aid \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n62 \n\nAnalysing the segmentation of creditors of the fund, it is possible to conclude that \n\nthe Resolution Fund and the bank syndicate would have had the same costs, but the \n\nState would only have had to lend 20% of the funds it actually lent. \n\n5.2.2. Recapitalization from senior debtors \n\nThe recapitalization process is common to all the approaches since debtholders, \n\nunder the new regulatory framework of bail-in resolution, are the only ones who can \n\nrecapitalize a failing institution (see Table 7 and 8).  \n\nThe conversion of debt into equity cannot be considered as a loss for debtholders \n\nsince the purpose of that conversion is to restore the entity\u2019s viability. In principle, \n\ndebtholders that convert into equity their assets will only face a change in their \n\nranking within the institution. \n\nDuring the first semester of 2014, BES\u2019 Common Equity Tier I ratio (see Table 4 \n\nand 5) fell behind the capital requirements requested by the Portuguese Central Bank \n\n(BdP) by 1.9 p.p.. The Tier I and Tier II ratios were also lower than the current EC\u2019s \n\nrequirements of respectively 1.5% and 2%. Considering the risk-weighted assets as \n\nconstant, it is possible to compute the amount of additional preferred shares and \n\nsubordinated debt needed for the bank to meet the basic capital requirements set by \n\nthe supervisors. \n\nIn total, senior debtholders would have needed to convert into equity instruments \n\n28% of their assets to recapitalize the bank. If this recapitalization would have been \n\nperformed in June 2014, in conjunction with the absorption of the loss, the institution \n\nwould have fulfilled the capital requirements set by the supervisors and probably \n\nwould not have been suspended as a counterpart of the Eurosystem, event that \n\ntriggered its resolution. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n63 \n\n5.2.3. Comments on the results \n\nAssuming that this bail-in exercise would have led to the institution\u2019s long-term \n\nviability, any of the hypothesis (H1, H2 and H3) would have meant significant less \n\ncosts to taxpayers than the original solution57. Even in the worst case scenario in \n\nwhich the Fund would have had to bear 72% of the losses (H2), the State would only \n\nhad to finance 40% of the costs that it actually did. \n\nBesides, even if the debtholders would have had to cover all the losses, they \n\nwould only have to sustain 28% of losses in their assets. Which can be considered a \n\nfair price to pay as to assure the financial stability and the viability of the institution. \n\nBesides, in ailing firms from other sectors, investors bear all the costs of their \n\nrecovery, so it is only reasonable that banks\u2019 investors support some of the costs of \n\ntheir financial institutions\u2019 recovery.  \n\n                                                \n57 Even though the Portuguese Government aid was a loan, the fact is that the interest rates paid by the Resolution \nFund do not constitute an earning for taxpayers as the Fund is a public institution (Alves, Peixoto, Sim\u00f5es, &amp; Moitinho, \n2015). In other words, the State lent itself money. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nConclusions \n\nAfter the last decade\u2019s financial events, the European Commission has \n\nintroduced several measures to improve supervision and regulation, on a European \n\nlevel, in the banking sector. Among those measures, was the enforcement of the \n\nbail-in tool whenever a financial institution is resolved. \n\nThe purpose of this paper was to describe this new regulation and to demonstrate \n\nhow it could be applied in a real case \u2013 BES. Besides, its implementation to this bank \n\nallowed a comparison with the resolution that was in fact applied. \n\nThe exercise consisted in the write-down and conversion of eligible liabilities so \n\nthat the institution could be restored to viability. There were three possibilities \n\nconsidered, the first was to allocate all the burden of the resolution process to the \n\ninstitution\u2019s investors, the second was to apply the framework currently in force \n\nthat states that the Resolution Fund can bear some costs of the resolution after \n\ninvestors have sustained 8% of losses in their assets. Finally, the third hypothesis \n\nwas that the costs of loss absorption would be divided equally between the \n\ninvestors and the Resolution Fund. \n\nThe results of this exercise suggest that the application of the bail-in to BES would \n\nhave granted, in the worst case scenario, savings for the Portuguese State of about \n\n60%. In addition, it was observed that it would have been sufficient that the \n\ninvestors of the entity had sustained losses of 28%, in order for the bank not to need \n\nan intervention. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n66 \n\nOf course that there are some limitations to these findings. First, this is an \n\nacademic exercise unable to predict whether the institution could be restored back \n\nto viability, even if the bail-in was applied. Besides, to complete the resolution \n\nprocess the management of BES would have had to be replaced and a restructuring \n\nand business reorganisation plan would have had to be executed. \n\nAnother setback was the general information provided by BES and Bankscope \n\nthat lacked detailed financial classification of items in the balance sheet. Without \n\nthis discrimination, the bail-in had to be roughly applied without taking in \n\nconsideration aspects like the maturities of certain liabilities or the amount of \n\nwritten-off debt that belonged to other Portuguese banks to allow the quantification \n\nof the contagion. \n\nOverall, the bail-in tool is a beneficial measure that is going to relieve Member \n\nStates and their taxpayers from the burden of aiding ailing financial institutions, \n\nand also to increase discipline in the sector. \n\nA very interesting further investigation on this topic would be to study the \n\nchanges that are occurring in European banks\u2019 balance sheets as a result of the \n\nreforms in the sector and its influence in the real economy. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n67 \n\nReferences \n\nAckermann, J.
