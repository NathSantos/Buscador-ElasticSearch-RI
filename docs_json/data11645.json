In 1756, \nPhillip Pfaff proposed that exposed pulp could be capped \nby gold sheet to protect the vital tissue, in an attempt \nto avoid the progress of the inflammatory process and \nnecrosis (1). The materials used for direct or indirect  pulp \ncapping should stimulate the reparative dentin formation, \nact against bacteria, be radiopaque, adhere to dentin and \nto restorative materials, be resistant to masticatory forces \nand seal the cavity (1).\n\nFrom the use of gold sheet until today, several materials \nwith different compositions have been used in pulp capping \nprocedures (2-4). Calcium hydroxide-based cements, first \nused by Hermann in 1920 (5), have been considered the \u201cgold \nstandard\u201d cements for pulp protection. Calcium hydroxide \n(CH) powder can be mixed with water or incorporated into \na resinous matrix, generally a salicylate ester, to obtain a \nself-setting cement. CH-based cements release calcium and \nhydroxyl ions, encouraging the formation of a reparative \ndentin (6) and killing bacteria (7). For indirect pulp capping \nit is important that cements be able to diffuse into dentin \nin order to signal the pulp cells.\n\nMore recently (8), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) \nwas introduced in Endodontics and showed better \n\nclinical performance used as direct pulp capping agent \nthan CH-based cements (9). MTA presents a chemical \ncomposition similar to Portland cement clinker, with the \naddition of bismuth oxide to improve its radiopacity (8). \nMTA\u2019s mechanism of action is similar to that of calcium \nhydroxide, as its interaction with water produces calcium \nhydroxide during the cement setting. In comparison to \nCH-based cements, MTA has lower solubility and higher \nmechanical properties and calcium ion release (3). However, \npure MTA as pulp capping is difficult due to the longer \nsetting time and poor handling. To take advantage of the \nbeneficial properties of MTA and to produce a cement \nwith improved handling properties, MTA and Portland \nhave been incorporated into non-aqueous vehicles, such \nas acrylic monomers or resins (2,10,11). To date, no pulp-\ncapping materials based on salicylate resin including MTA \nor Portland in their composition have been developed.\n\nSalicylate compounds are widely used in the \npharmaceutical industry and have anti-inflammatory \npotential (12). Aiming to produce a low-solubility \nsalicylate, a glycerol salicylate was synthesized from the \ntransesterification reaction of glycerol and methyl salicylate \n(13). This glycerol salicylate can present up to three reactive \ngroups to chelate calcium ions and set, instead of the \ntwo reactive sites present in dissalicylates usually used \n\nISSN 0103-6440Brazilian Dental Journal (2015) 26(4): 357-362\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0103-6440201300218\n\n\n\nBraz Dent J 26(4) 2015 \n\n358\n\nF.\nF.\n\n P\nor\n\nte\nll\na \n\net\n a\n\nl.\n\nin commercial CH-based pulp capping cements. Glycerol \nsalicylate molecules are composed of three salicylates \nbonded to a central glycerol, which confers high viscosity \nto the resin. Thus, a diluent such as the methyl salicylate, \nis required to adjust resin viscosity and make it suitable \nfor clinical use.\n\nThis study evaluated the water sorption, solubility, pH \nand ability to diffuse into dentin of experimental glycerol \nsalicylate-based pulp-capping cement in comparison to \nconventional calcium hydroxide-based cement.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nAn experimental cement was developed consisting of \n\n60% glycerol salicylate resin, obtained according to Portella \net al. (13), 10% methyl salicylate (Vetec Qu\u00edmica Fina Ltda, \nDuque de Caxias, RJ, Brazil), 25% calcium hydroxide (CH; \nBiodin\u00e2mica, Ibipor\u00e3, PR, Brazil) and 5% Portland cement \n(CP IV-32; Votorantim Cimentos, Esteio, RS, Brazil). The \nabove concentrations refer to the weight percentage. \nLiquid (glycerol salicylate resin and methyl salicylate) and \npowder (calcium hydroxide and Portland cement) reagents \nwere weighed on an analytical scale, according to the \nabove concentrations and hand mixed on a glass plate. \nFresh mixtures of the cements were inserted into silicon \nmatrix to produce sample discs of 10\u00b10.1 mm diameter \nand 1.0\u00b10.01 mm thick. Samples remained stored at 36 \n\u00baC in a humid cabinet up to the complete setting of the \nmaterials. The experimental cement\u2019s sorption, solubility, \npH and cement diffusion into dentin were compared with \nthose of a commercial pulp capping cement (Hydcal; \nTechnew Com. Ind. Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). Hydcal \nwas manipulated according manufacturer instructions, by \nhand mixing equal amounts of base and catalyst pastes.\n\nSorption and Solubility\nSorption and solubility were evaluated as described in \n\na previous study (14). Three samples were soaked in 10 mL \nof distilled water at 36 \u00b0C for 7 days. The volume (V) of \nthe specimens was calculated before immersion. The mass \nof the specimens was determined before (m1), immediately \nafter water immersion (m2) and after drying (m3). Before \nm1 and m3 were assessed, the specimens were kept in \ndesiccators and weighed every 24 h, until a constant mass \nwas obtained. Water sorption (Wsp) and water solubility \n(Wsl) were calculated according to the following equations, \nand the mean values of three specimens were recorded:\n\nWsp=(m2?m3)/V\nWsl=(m1?m3)/V\n\npH Analysis\nThe pH of storage water from the sorption and solubility \n\ntests, and water from other samples stored in the same \n\nway for 24 h and 28 days, were evaluated using a digital \npHmeter (DM-23; Digicrom Analytical Ltda, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, \nBrazil). Three measurements were performed per group \nfor each period, at 24 h, 7 days and 28 days. The initial \npH of the distilled water was 7.79. Formation of crystals \nduring water storage in the pH test was observed by direct \nvisualization. The crystals were characterized by Raman \nspectroscopy using a 785 nm laser (Senterra; Bruker Optics, \nEttlingen, Germany).\n\nRaman Analysis of Cement Diffusion\nThe buccal enamel of two bovine incisors was ground \n\nto expose the superficial dentin. The dentin was prepared \nwith 600-grit SiC paper for 30 s in running water. The \nexperimental cements were manipulated and applied over \nthe exposed dentin, and then restored using a self-etching \nadhesive system (Clearfil SE Bond; Kuraray America Inc., \nNew York, NY, USA) and a micro-hybrid composite resin \n(Charisma; Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany) \nto simulate clinical situation. The teeth were stored in \nsimulated body fluid (SBF) (15) at 36 \u00baC for 28 days. SBF had \nthe following ion concentration, in mol/m\u00b3: Na+ (142.0), K+ \n(5.0), Mg2+ (1.5), Ca2+ (2.5), Cl- (147.8), HCO3- (4.2), HPO42- \n(1.0) and SO42- (0.5). The pH was adjusted to 7.4.\n\nThe teeth were sectioned longitudinally to the crown \naxis at the center of the restoration. The hemisections were \nsonicated for 180 s to remove debris and the specimens were \nanalyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy (Senterra, Bruker). \nMapping areas of 100 x 100 \u00b5m of dentin underneath the \ncement (Fig. 1) were analyzed. The samples were irradiated \non 100 points. Each point was irradiated 2 times for 5 s \nby a 785 nm 100 mW laser. The spectra were obtained, \nthe integrals of the 1,084 and 1,034 cm-1 peaks were \ndetermined for each point and the values were plotted onto \na graph. The 1,084 and 1,034 cm-1 peaks relate to calcium \nhydroxide chemical bonds (13) and to bands of salicylate \nresin chemical bonds (16), respectively.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nDifferences in sorption and solubility were analyzed \n\nby t tests, and the differences in pH values were analyzed \nusing two-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s test. The significance \nlevel was set at 5%.\n\nResults\nTable 1 shows the water sorption and solubility and pH of \n\nwater storage after different periods. There were significant \ndifferences in sorption (p=0.015) and solubility (p=0.049) \nbetween the materials, glycerol salicylate-based cement \nexhibiting higher water sorption and lower solubility values \ncompared with Hydcal. Both cements were able to alkalize \nthe medium at 24 h and sustain the alkalinity after 28 days.\n\n\n\nBraz Dent J 26(4) 2015\n\n359\n\nG\nly\n\nce\nro\n\nl s\nal\n\nic\nyl\n\nat\ne \n\np\nu\nlp\n\n-c\nap\n\np\nin\n\ng \nce\n\nm\nen\n\nt\n\nThe presence of crystals was observed in the pH test \nwater for the glycerol salicylate-based cement after 28 days. \nOne of these crystals and its Raman spectrum are shown in \nFigure 2. The micro Raman analysis of the crystal exhibits \n550, 665, 836, 886, 1050 and 1159 cm-1 bands (Fig. 2c). \n\nFigure 3 shows representative spectra of non-infiltrated \ndentin and dentin infiltrated by cement. Raman band shift \npresented 804, 962, 1034 and 1084 cm-1 peaks. Figure 4 \nshows the intensity of the 1084 and 1034cm-1 peaks on \nthe mapped dentin adjacent to the cement after sample \nstorage in SBF. The sample of Hydcal presented an intense \ndiffusion of cement up to 40 \u00b5m depth. The tooth that \nreceived the glycerol salicylate-based cement showed \ncement penetration up to 20 \u00b5m but this diffusion was not \nconsistent for the entire region, as in the Hydcal sample.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this study, novel pulp-capping cement based on a \n\nsalicylate resin, calcium hydroxide and Portland cement \nwas developed and had the physicochemical properties \n\nof sorption, solubility, pH and the ability to diffuse into \ndentin compared with Hydcal (a commercial calcium \nhydroxide-based pulp-capping cement of similar chemical \ncomposition). Hydcal is basically composed of salicylate \nresin and calcium hydroxide. Prior the development of \nglycerol salicylate-based pulp-capping cement, a set of \nPortland cement concentrations was tested, ranging from \n5 to 15%. Calcium hydroxide was replaced by Portland \ncement in the mixture. Due to the low availability of Ca2+ \nin groups with higher Portland contents, the setting times \nincreased and cement became too dark (since grey Portland \ncement was used to formulate experimental cements in \npilot studies). Furthermore, the cement without calcium \nhydroxide did not set. Based on that, it was assumed \nthat 5% (in weight) of Portland cement represented \nthe concentration that exerted less influence on the \nexperimental cement\u2019s properties (setting time and color).\n\nGlycerol salicylate-based cement is set by an acid-\nbase reaction between calcium hydroxide and salicylate \nresin. Calcium is chelated by salicylate, forming a calcium \nsalicylate salt (13). This is a similar hardening process to \nthat of available commercial calcium hydroxide cements. \nNevertheless, the majority of current cements are composed \nof a dysfunctional salicylate ester (21,22), unlike the resin \nused in this study, which presents up to three salicylates in \nits molecule, which theoretically allows the binding of up \nto three calcium ions by the same molecule, contributing \nto the lower solubility of glycerol salicylate-based cement \nin comparison to Hydcal. Additionally, in contact with \nhumidity Portland cement hydrates, forming a hydrated \ncalcium silicate matrix and calcium hydroxide. Portland \nhydration and crystal formation occurred when the glycerol \nsalicylate-based cement was immersed in water. Silicate \nbending bands at 665 cm-1 and symmetrical stretching \nbands at 800-1050 cm-1, characteristic of calcium silicate \nhydrate are presented in Figure 2. Band 1050 cm-1 could \nbe also present in glycerol resin. However, the crystal was \nnot analyzed in contact with grycerol resin, indicating the \ncorrespondence of 1050 cm-1 to calcium silicate hydrate. The \n550 cm-1 and 1159 cm-1 bands can be assigned to alite and \nbelite, and to bassanite, respectively, probably present due an \n\nincomplete hydration of \nPortland cement (17,18). \nWater uptake promoted \nby the Portland cement \ncould lead to hydraulic \nsetting, promoting the \nformation of a calcium \nsilicate hydrate matrix \n(23), which has the \npotential to stimulate \nmineral deposition in \n\nTable 1.

In \nthis way, the chemical features of cement after hydration \nlead to a bioactive surface that possibly may help to form \nreparative dentin, stimulating the mineralization of tissues.\n\nAside from higher water sorption of the glycerol \nsalicylate-based cement, its solubility was lower than \nHydcal. The great amount of salicylate resin used in the \nexperimental cement could explain these patterns of \nsorption and solubility. The salicylate resin matrix, present \non both cements, contributes to elevated water sorption \nand solubility, insofar as salicylate-based cements are prone \nto absorbing water (24) and solubilizing (11,25). Higher \nwater sorption could lead to cement swelling, offsetting \nthe negative dimensional changes that occur with the \ncement\u2019s solubilization. However, the dimensional changes \nof the cements after water sorption were not assessed. \nAs in a previous study (14), neither the ISO 6876 (Dental \nroot canal sealing materials) nor ISO 9917 (Water-based \ncements) parameters were adopted to measure sorption and \nsolubility, since both tested cements are resin-based and the \naforementioned parameters are designed for water-based \ncements and root canal sealing materials. The lack of an \ninternational standard method to assess the properties of \nresin-modified calcium silicate cements has already been \npointed out (2).\n\nFluid stability is important for maintaining an effective \nseal against bacteria and preventing the development \nof defects under restorations, which could impair the \nrestoration\u2019s resistance (26). In a previous study, the authors \nstated that traditional calcium hydroxide-based cements \ndissolve over time in a short period (i.e., 2 years) (2). The \n\nlow solubility levels of glycerol salicylate-based cement \nfollowed by cement diffusion in dentin and calcium-\nsilicate crystal formation could mitigate this shortcoming. \nMoreover, Portland cement has recognized bioactivity, \nstimulating the production of an apatite structure over \nits surface in contact with tissues (27) and allowing the \nexpression of mRNAs from a dentin-specific protein and \na non-collagen protein involved in mineralization (28). \nThese properties could accelerate the development of a \nmineralized barrier over the exposed pulp.\n\nFigure 2.

Representative spectra of dentin that did not receive a pulp-\ncapping material (A), that received Hydcal (B) and that received the \nglycerol salicylate-based cement (C). \n\n\n\nBraz Dent J 26(4) 2015\n\n361\n\nG\nly\n\nce\nro\n\nl s\nal\n\nic\nyl\n\nat\ne \n\np\nu\nlp\n\n-c\nap\n\np\nin\n\ng \nce\n\nm\nen\n\nt\n\nRecently, a practice-based randomized clinical trial \nevaluated the success of direct pulp capping in permanent \nteeth performed with both calcium hydroxide and MTA as \npulp-capping cements, and estimates that the failure rates \nafter 24 months reached 31.5% and 19.7% for teeth pulp \ncapped with calcium hydroxide and MTA, respectively (9). \nThese results corroborate those of Mente et al. (29), where \nMTA showed a higher success rate than calcium hydroxide \n(78% vs. 60%). For direct pulp capping, both materials \npresent the same success rates and ability to stimulate \nreparative dentin formation (30). Thus, to improve the \nhandling properties of MTA or Portland and optimize its \nresults on direct pulp capping, MTA was incorporated on \na salicylate resin matrix (10,11).\n\nThe anti-inflammatory potential of salicylates is \nprobably present in salicylate resins. Salicylates are \ncapable of inhibiting the action of cyclooxygenase-2 and \nconsequently the synthesis of prostaglandin (12). This \nanti-inflammatory property is desirable for cements that \nwill be placed in contact with pulp tissue to reduce the \ninflammatory process provoked by caries progression, in \nan attempt to prevent the development of pulp necrosis \nand/or postoperative sensitivity.\n\nGlycerol salicylate-based cement and Hydcal were able \nto elevate water pH above 8.5 after 24 h of immersion. This \n\nFigure 4.

The \nalkalinity of both cements increased to pH=12 at 7 days and \ndecreased slightly after 28 days, but both cements sustained \nthe high pH. The increase in pH is probably due to hydroxyl \nions being released from the calcium hydroxide originally \npresent in the cements\u2019 compositions and from the calcium \nhydroxide formed from the hydration of Portland cement.\n\nExperimental glycerol salicylate-based Portland cement \ndid not show the same diffusion pattern into dentin as \nHydcal does, when evaluated using Raman to map the \nintensity of 1,084 and 1,034 cm-1 peaks related to the \nchemical bonds of calcium hydroxide and salicylate resin, \nrespectively. For the non-infiltrated dentin, the peak at the \n962 cm-1 band corresponds to symmetric stretching mode of \nphosphate (19). In the spectrum of the dentin adjacent to \nthe cement, other peaks were noticed, like 1,084 cm-1, which \nis present for calcium hydroxide (13), and at 1,034 and 804 \ncm-1, which refer to bending in plane CH mode (16,20) and \nto the stretching Caromatic-COOH of salicylate resin (16). The \ndiffusion of cement components, such as calcium hydroxide, \ninto dentin is expected to be beneficial for reparative dentin \nformation. Hydcal presents ethyl toluene sulfonamide in \nits composition, a plasticizer that could decrease cement \nviscosity and improve penetration into dentin.
