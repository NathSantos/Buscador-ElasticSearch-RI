A very big thanks to Dr. Karim Erzini for the \n\nopportunity to gain so much knowledge in the field and for the vital help throughout the thesis process.  \n\nI would also like to thank my amazing parents who supported my passions in the marine \n\nsciences, my sister for being my rock through all the stress, my professors from Florida International \n\nUniversity for the indispensable knowledge that permitted me to pursue a Master\u2019s degree, as well as my \n\nfriends and my family members from all over the world who found interest in my work and kept pushing \n\nme to pursue my dreams.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nV \n\n \n\nAbstract  \n\nThe purpose of this project is to reduce bycatch by modifying a monofilament trammel net \n\ncommonly used in small scale fisheries along the southern European and Mediterranean coasts. The \n\nstandard trammel net consists of three layers of netting: a small mesh inner panel and two large mesh \n\nouter panels. The modified net has a single layer of netting 3 meshes high between the trammel net and \n\nthe footrope termed \u201cgreca\u201d, also known as a selvedge net. The main goal was to provide enough \n\nevidence of benefits that the modification poses, such as reduction in environmental deterioration, \n\ndecrease in bycatch removal, and preventing a fisheries collapse, to local fishermen to convince them \n\nswitch to the \u201cgreca\u201d net. Fishing was conducted  off  the coast  of  Algarve  with  the  boat  departing \n\nfrom Quarteria from October 2016 to February 2017 with a total of 20 trips.  Each fish and invertebrate \n\nwas identified and measured, and recorded in which net type it was caught after a 24 hour soak time \n\nperiod. The time that it took to remove bycatch species was later analyzed using videos recorded \n\nonboard using GoPros and net damage assessment was conducted after the sampling period. Analysis \n\nusing PRIMER and PERMANOVA  showed that the factors depth and target catch affected commercial \n\ncatch among the net types. This was also true for the combined catch data. Bycatch was also affected by \n\nthe factor seasonality, however the separation between the two seasons was moderately distinct. When \n\nobserving commercial catch, the greca net caught 53.9% of that of the standard trammel net regarding \n\nabundance and 64.3% of that of the standard trammel net in biomass. The economic value of the greca \n\nnet catches was 61.8% of that of the standard net. The most significant decrease in commercial catch was \n\nseen among the sole species (or demersal commercial catch). Regarding discards, the greca trammel net \n\ncaught 45.3% of that in the standard trammel net in commercial discards abundance and 57.7% of that in \n\nthe standard net in bycatch abundance. The greca trammel net commercial discard biomass was 31.8% of \n\nthat of the standard trammel net and 80.4% of the standard net bycatch biomass. For the three main \n\nbycatch species greca net catches for Longfin gurnards (Chelidonichthys obscurus)  were 37.8% of those \n\nof the standard net caught, 128.4% of the standard net for Atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber colias) and \n\n66.9% of those of the standard net for the Greater weever (Trachinus draco). The time it took to remove \n\nan individual from the net was timed and the six most abundant bycatch species\u2019 exhibited the \n\nimportance of reducing bycatch. Some species will eventually take away many hours over the course of \n\na year that could be spent on removing commercial catch or reducing labor in general. Less bycatch also \n\nreduces the damage that occurs in the net, relieving fishermen of additional costs in repairs. This also \n\nprevents loss in commercial catch, such as the observed decrease in catch rate of sole species in the \n\n\n\nVI \n\n \n\nmodified trammel net. The results suggest that the greca modification, or selvedge net, did reduce \n\nbycatch abundance but, also reduced abundance and earnings in commercial catches. It is concluded that \n\nfurther research needs to be conducted on ways toreduce bycatch using trammel nets while maintaining \n\nsimilar if not increasing earnings.  \n\n \n\nKey  Words: Bycatch  Reduction;  Discards;  Trammel  Nets;  Catch  Selectivity;  Small  Scale \n\nFisheries \n\n \n\nResumo \n\nO objetivo do presente estudo foi testar redes de tresmalho modificadas, utilizadas \n\nfrequentemente na costa Sul da Europa e Mediterr\u00e2neo, com o objetivo de reduzir capturas acidentais. A \n\ncaptura acidental ocorre quando esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o-comerciais ou de baixo valor comercial s\u00e3o capturadas \n\npelas redes de pesca e, por isso, s\u00e3o rejeitadas e devolvidas ao mar ap\u00f3s a captura. As rejei\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o \n\nassim compostas por esp\u00e9cies que n\u00e3o possuem valor comercial para venda no mercado. Uma esp\u00e9cie \n\ncomercial pode ser tamb\u00e9m rejeitada devido a reduzido tamanho, a danos provocados pelas artes de \n\npesca ou por esp\u00e9cies necr\u00f3fagos (e.g. anf\u00edpodes), ou ainda por imposi\u00e7\u00e3o legislativa que protege a \n\nesp\u00e9cie. As redes de pesca, apesar de terem alguma seletividade, s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis por altas taxas de \n\npesca acidental e rejei\u00e7\u00f5es. As redes de tresmalho s\u00e3o constituidas de tr\u00eas camadas de rede: um painel \n\ninterior de malha pequena e dois pain\u00e9is exteriores de malha grande. As capturas geralmente passam \n\natrav\u00e9s das redes exteriores, ficando presos em bolsos formados pela combina\u00e7\u00e3o das redes exteriores e \n\ninteriores, processo este denominado de  \u201ctrammeling\u201d. Na rede modificada testada foi adicionada uma \n\ncamada extra de rede chamada \u201cgreca\u201d ou \u201cselvedge net\u201d, que possui tr\u00eas malhas de altura e se situa \n\nentre o tresmalho e a relinga inferior. Esta por\u00e7\u00e3o de rede difere das restantes tamb\u00e9m no material usado \n\nna sua constru\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nO principal objetivo do presente estudo foi fornecer provas dos benef\u00edcios desta modifica\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nnomeadamente na redu\u00e7\u00e3o de capturas acidentais, na redu\u00e7\u00e3o do risco de colapso de stocks pesqueiros, e \n\nna motiva\u00e7\u00e3o dos pescadores locais para a adop\u00e7\u00e3o do tresmalho modificado (\u201cgreca\u201d). Este objetivo foi \n\nmotivado pelas novas politicas da Uni\u00e3o Europeia \u2018A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and \n\neliminate discards in European fisheries (COM, 2007)\u2019, que encorajam a ado\u00e7\u00e3o de novas tecnologias, \n\nmesmo que estas impliquem uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o tempor\u00e1ria nas taxas de lucro, que possam beneficiar o \n\n\n\nVII \n\n \n\nfuturo da ind\u00fastria pesqueira que, atualmente, sofre de m\u00e1s pr\u00e1ticas de gest\u00e3o, falta de fiscaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nresposta \u00e0s atividades ilegais. Para este estudo, a amostragem decorreu a bordo de uma embarca\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npesqueira comercial ao longo da costa do Algarve. A embarca\u00e7\u00e3o \u201cAlfonsino\u201d e a sua tripula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ntrabalharam em conjunto com a equipa de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e partilharam o tempo passado no mar entre as \n\nsuas pr\u00f3prias redes e os tresmalhos a testar. Todas as sa\u00eddas de amostragem aconteceram de manh\u00e3, a \n\npartir do porto de Quarteira. As redes foram caladas e deixadas dentro de \u00e1gua durante \n\naproximadamente 24 horas. Posteriormente foram aladas atrav\u00e9s de um guincho met\u00e1lico e limpas \n\nmanualmente. Os peixes e invertebrados capturados foram identificados sempre que poss\u00edvel at\u00e9 \u00e0 \n\nesp\u00e9cie  e medidos ao cent\u00edmetro. A rede em que cada indiv\u00edduo foi capturado, bem como a zona da \n\nrede e o destino de cada esp\u00e9cimen foi tamb\u00e9m registado. Em laborat\u00f3rio as imagens obtidas pelas \n\nc\u00e2maras colocadas a bordo (que filmaram todos os momentos das opera\u00e7\u00f5es de pesca) foram \n\ncuidadosamente analisadas  para temporizar a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies importantes na captura acidental \n\n(determinadas a priori  pela sua abund\u00e2ncia). A abund\u00e2ncia foi observada para capturas comerciais e \n\nrejei\u00e7\u00f5es (compostas por capturas comerciais e acidentais) de modo a  comparar os dois tipos de redes. \n\nA rela\u00e7\u00e3o peso-comprimento de cada esp\u00e9cie foi usada para calcular e comparar a biomassa das capturas \n\nem ambas as redes de tresmalho. Os valores de venda em lota por esp\u00e9cie e em cada tipo de rede foram \n\ncalculados com os valores de biomassa das capturas e o pre\u00e7o m\u00e9dio por quilograma de venda. Danos \n\ninfligidos aos dois tipos de redes foram tamb\u00e9m avaliados ap\u00f3s a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o das amostragens, por \n\ninspe\u00e7\u00e3o visual da totalidade das redes. Categorizando a dimens\u00e3o das aberturas encontradas nas redes \n\ncom base no seu di\u00e2metro, foi possivel fazer a compara\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel de danos inflingidos aos dois tipos \n\nde redes utilizados. O sofware PRIMER / PERMANOVA + foi utilizado para avaliar semelhan\u00e7as entre \n\namostragens e os dois tipos de redes, designadamente atrav\u00e9s das t\u00e9cnicas MDS (Multi-dimensional \n\nscaling), ANOSIM, (Analysis of similarities), SIMPER (Similarity Percentages) e one-way ou two-way \n\nPERMANOVA s. Para isso foram usados tr\u00eas fatores para as capturas comerciais, capturas acidentais e \n\nambas combinadas: profundidade, esp\u00e9cie alvo e esta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano. O tipo de rede foi utilizado apenas \n\ncomo fator nos dados combinados, uma vez que n\u00e3o apresentou diferen\u00e7as significativas, com clusters \n\nde similaridades formados com base nas viagens. Esta an\u00e1lise indicou que a profundidade afeta as \n\ncapturas comerciais nos dois tipos de rede, bem como as capturas totais, que incluem capturas \n\ncomercias, acidentais e rejei\u00e7\u00f5es. A profundidade afetou tamb\u00e9m as capturas acidentais, em conjunto \n\ncom a esta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano, com n\u00edveis de influ\u00eancia semelhantes. A separa\u00e7\u00e3o entre clusters de similaridades \n\npor esta\u00e7\u00e3o foi moderadamente forte. A esp\u00e9cie alvo foi o fator com um efeito mais significativo tanto \n\n\n\nVIII \n\n \n\nnas capturas totais como nas capturas comerciais. A  \"Greca\" indicou uma abund\u00e2ncia de capturas \n\ncomerciais de 53.9% e biomassa de 64.3% comparativamente ao  tresmalho standard. A \"Greca\" \n\nproduziu 61.8% do valor comercial do tresmalho standard. A diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de capturas comerciais foi \n\nmais intensa para as esp\u00e9cies de linguados (esp\u00e9cies comerciais). Paralelamente, a \"Greca\" obteve \n\nigualmente uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o de 45.3% na abund\u00e2ncia de esp\u00e9cies comerciais rejeitadas, e de 57.7% na \n\nabund\u00e2ncia de capturas acidentais. Relativamente \u00e0 biomassa, a \"Greca\" obteve um valor de 31.8% de \n\nrejei\u00e7\u00f5es de esp\u00e9cies comerciais e 80.4% da biomassa de capturas acidentais, quando comparado com o \n\ntresmalho standard. As tr\u00eas principais esp\u00e9cies capturadas acidentalmente foram: ruivo (Chelidonichthys \n\nobscurus), com uma captura de 37.8% e peixe-aranha (Trachinus draco) com uma captura de 66.9% no \n\ntresmalho modificado, quando comparadas com as capturas no tresmalho standard. A terceira esp\u00e9cie \n\nmais capturada acidentalmente foi  cavala (Scomber colias), com uma abund\u00e2ncia 28.4% mais elevada no \n\ntresmalho standard.O tempo de remo\u00e7\u00e3o das seis esp\u00e9cies com mais capturas acidentais mostrou a \n\nimport\u00e2ncia de reduzir estas capturas, pois a sua remo\u00e7\u00e3o das redes consome tempo e aumenta os danos \n\ninfligidos \u00e0s redes. Estes danos s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis por perdas monet\u00e1rias atrav\u00e9s do custo dos reparos e \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o de capturas comerciais, como observado com a catura de solhas no tresmalho modificado. Os \n\nresultados sugerem que o tresmalho modificado reduziu a abund\u00e2ncia das capturas acidentais, mas \n\ntamb\u00e9m reduziu a abund\u00e2ncia e lucro das capturas comerciais. O resultado indica que ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1ria a \n\nrealiza\u00e7\u00e3o de mais estudos de modo a otimizar a rede modificada e reduzir as capturas acidentais \n\ncausadas por redes de tresmalho evitando efeitos negativos  nas vendas em lota efectuadas pelas \n\nembarca\u00e7\u00f5es desta atividade. \n\n \n\nDescritores: Redu\u00e7\u00e3o da Captura Acess\u00f3ria; Rejei\u00e7\u00f5es; Redes Trammel; Selectividade de \n\ncaptura; Pequena Escala de Pesca \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIX \n\n \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAcknowledgements ...................................................................................................................................

This has also caused environmental disasters and even fisheries to collapse due \n\nto overexploitation and overfishing. A key issue that the world has taken notice of is bycatch and \n\ndiscarding practices. Bycatch is the term used when marine species of little or no commercial value \n\nare accidently caught. The reason for bycatch is often due to being caught alongside targeted species \n\nthat live in the same environment and because some fishing gears lack selectivity. Due to their low \n\neconomic value, bycatch species are often discarded, or thrown away. Commercial species are \n\ndiscarded as well but, for various reasons. Some of these include the organism has been scavenged on, \n\nthe species is poisonous, it has the potential to spoil rapidly, there is lack of space onboard, the quotas \n\nfor said species are reached, it is a prohibited species to catch or caught with prohibited gear, the \n\norganism has parasites, there are visible signs of damage from the gear, the organism is too small to \n\ncatch or is considered a juvenile, it is the wrong sex, or it is incompatible with the rest of the catch \n\n(Hall et al., 2000). In recent years, the average of discards for commercial fisheries has been 27 \n\nmillion tons per year, varying from 17.9 million tons to as high as 39.5 million tons (Alverson et al., \n\n1994). Although discarding and bycatch are believed to be problematic, there is no agreement upon an \n\nexact definition of these two terms regarding fisheries, the impact on both bycatch and commercial \n\nspecies\u2019 population, the impacts on the ecosystem, and the ethics of fishing (Borges et al., 2001). \n\nHowever, some researchers have noticed that certain bycatch species pose problems for fishermen due \n\nto reduction in net area, and an increase in labor time due to the need to disentangle species from the \n\nnets within their fisheries (Metin et al., 2009). \n\nOn a global scale, there is not enough research on understanding the effects of bycatch. \n\nAccording to ICCAT1, IATTC2, IOTC3, and SPC4 there are 37 fishing nations that use pelagic gillnets \n\nor driftnets of which only 5 have observer programs that gather data on bycatch. In comparison there \n\nare 14 nations that use trawls with 4 having observer programs, 40 nations using pelagic longlines of \n\nwhich only 15 have observer programs, and 62 nations that use purse seines of which only 10 nations \n\nhave observer programs (Lewison et al., 2004). Prior to tackling the problems of bycatch and discards \n\n                                                             \n1 ICCAT- International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna  \n2 IATTC- Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission  \n3 IOTC- Indian Ocean Tuna Commission  \n4 SPC- Secretariat of the Pacific Community \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nin these countries, research must be conducted in order to understand the magnitude of the problem. \n\nThis is especially neccessary in countries with little or no legislation that controls fishing methods in \n\norder to prevent a collapse which would affect the economy and the people involved in the fishing \n\nindustry. \n\n \n\n1.2 The ban on discards in the E.U. \n\nThe European Union legislation established a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and \n\neliminate discards in European fisheries (COM, 2007). This policy discusses the issues being faced \n\ndue to discarding, the measures required to prompt a discards ban, and how the ban  will  affect  the  \n\neconomy.  In the initial article, the legislation encourages  new technology  in  an  effort  to  avoid  the  \n\nnecessity  of  discarding.  The section highlights the importance of regulating what is caught rather \n\nthan regulating landings, meaning all individuals of all species (commercial or bycatch) caught will be \n\nbrought to port. The second article discusses the effects, causes, and extent of discards, highlighting the \n\neffect on biodiversity in terms of reproduction and sensitivity to damage by specific gear. The section \n\ncontinues by identifying specific areas in Europe and the comparison of bycatch rates based on the \n\ncommonly used gears of each area. The third article deliberates how to move towards a discard ban and \n\nreduction of by-catch progressively, giving international examples and the terms that discarding would \n\nfall under along with the exceptions.  \n\nAdditional instruments and supplements that can be useful are suggested such as fees on \n\nbycatch and obligatory switching of fishing grounds. Instead of specifications for the gears, there will \n\nbe requirements for specific results. This would permit the fisheries to decide what is most practical \n\nand economic prompting a discussion between researchers, fishermen, and the auction officials. The \n\nfourth article focuses on monitoring and controlling the fisheries due to areas that have little or weak \n\nenforcement if a ban is put into effect. It references how to enforce the ban using an observer scheme \n\nwhich includes careful monitoring of landings, an electronic log book, monitoring and control of gear, \n\nand stakeholders involvements and cooperation. The fifth section considers the social impact of the \n\npolicy and what the incentives to change will be. In the short-term this change in policy can result in \n\ncost increase and losses in income. However, in the long term this policy will result in larger and \n\nhealthier stocks, which will result in increased fishing opportunities over the course of many years. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.3 Small scale fisheries in Portugal  \n\nIt is imperative to control the amount of fishing occurring in each country, especially \n\nthose that rely on fishing as it pertains heavily to the nation\u2019s economy. Small scale fisheries are \n\nresponsible for the majority of seafood sold in the market worldwide. In European waters, there are \n\nnearly 75,000 vessels that are less than 12 m and the majority are involved in small scale fisheries \n\n(Stergiou et al. 2006) or artisanal fishing. A significant amount of the Portuguese fleet is considered \n\nsmall scale fisheries with the majority of targeted stocks being demersal species, or species that dwell \n\non or near the ocean floor (Table 1.3.1). \n\nTable 1.3.1. Fleet size in continental Portugal per gear type based on stock type in 2015 (Source: DGRNSSM) \n \n\nStock Gear N \n\nDemersal \n\nDemersal \n\nDemersal &amp; Mackerel \n\nSmall Pelagics \n\nDemersal and Pelagics \n\nFixed gear&lt;12m \n\nFixed gear >=12m \n\nTrawl \n\nSeine pursing \n\nMultigear \n\n6216 \n\n348 \n\n81 \n\n181 \n\n32 \n\n \n\nIn Portugal, nets, which include trammel and gill nets, have the second highest number of \n\nlicenses right after longlines (Table 1 . 3 . 2), with trammel nets accounting for 18% of all small \n\nscale fisheries licenses in the Algarve (Stergiou et al., 2006). The only exception to this is North \n\nPortugal where trawls were second to nets in the amount of licenses issued in 2015. \n\nTable 1.3.2.

Traps most commonly used in areas such as the Algarve include: metal frames with hard \n\nplastic netting with a single entry of octopi, large traps with metal frames for both fish and cuttlefish, \n\nand wire traps for fish (Erzini, 2008). The trawls category include multiple gears such as bivalve \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\ndredges, \u201cotter trawls\u201d, and beam trawls. It is important to note that although there is a specific \n\nnumber of licenses for each of the categories, these numbers do not necessarily indicate the number of \n\nvessels using solely the specific gear as most vessels have licenses for more than one gear. More than \n\n90% of fishing vessels in Portugal are licensed to use multiple types of gear (Baeta et al., 2009) as \n\nseen in Table 1.3.3 (Polyvalent fishing). \n\nTable 1.3.3.

The fishing industry has had a \n\ngreat effect on trophic level interactions and the food web. Globally, due to fisheries landings, trophic \n\nlevels have been declining at a rate of 0.1 per decade, even though landings have not significantly \n\nincreased (Pauly et al., 1997). Static nets are destroying the environment, disturbing food web \n\ninteractions among trophic levels, and affecting future catch rates. In a study regarding the effect of \n\ndifferent gears on trophic levels, trammel nets were responsible for the catch of over 50% of omnivores \n\nthat prefer other animals, over 25% of carnivores that prefer decapods, and about 20% of carnivores \n\nwith a preference for fish and cephalopods (Stergiou et al., 2007). \n\nSeveral types of fishing gears are used in the marine environment ranging from gears that \n\nrequire a crew such as static nets and trawlers, to gears that can be operated by a single fisherman such \n\nas fishing poles and pots. An important static gear in coastal waters worldwide is the trammel net \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2008). Similar to other gear, trammel nets differ in design depending on the target \n\ncatch and the environment. In general, trammel nets have three panels of netting which are made up \n\nof either multifilament or monofilament. There is a loose small mesh inner panel (hanging ratio \n\nranges from 0.3 to 0.5) between two larger mesh panels (hanging ratio are usually more than 0.5) and \n\na vertical slack ( the ratio of the height of the small-meshed inner panel to large-meshed outer \n\npanels) that usually ranges from 2.0 to 3.0 (Erzini et al. 2006). The bottom of the net is connected to a \n\nlead line and floats are attached to the top of the net. In comparison to gillnets that are designed to \n\nwedge, entangle, or gill a fish, trammel nets are also capable of catching fish and invertebrates by \n\n\u201cpocketing\u201d or trammeling which consists of the fish being pushed through one of the outer larger mesh \n\npanels into a pocket formed by the inner smaller mesh (Fabi et al., 2002). The selectivity of size is \n\nrestricted with very little fish being caught that are more than 20% smaller or 20% larger than the \n\noptimum length of the mesh size (Aydin et al., 2015). There is also the semi-trammel net which differs \n\nin the fact that there is only one layer of outer webbing (Thomas 2002).  \n\nWhen a single gear targets a specific species during a particular time of year, this is called a \n\nm\u00e9tier.  In the Algarve, there are four important m\u00e9tiers for trammel nets. Sepia officinalis and \n\nSolea species are caught year round by a variety of trammel nets while Pagrus species, which are \n\nusually caught in summer, and Lophius piscatorius both require larger vessels and specific trammel \n\nnets (Erzini et al. 2001). \n\nSince some  gear  is static,  such  as trammel  nets,  initial  catches becomes easy prey for \n\npredators.  Often  when  nets are  pulled up  bycatch  species  have  already been  picked  apart. \n\nMortality is also inevitable for some individuals upon being hauled onboard. A schematic drawn by \n\nGasper and Chicharo (2007) displays all these possibilities resulting in either direct or indirect \n\nmortality in Figure 1.4.1. Some are dropped on the deck and left to die as fishermen work quickly \n\nand have no concern for the species while other individuals are ripped apart or smashed out of the \n\nnet for efficiency purposes. Certain species pose a danger to the fishermen and therefore are killed to \n\nprevent any onboard injuries. While some make it off board, seagulls trail the boats and are in close \n\nenough proximity to grab the organism before there is a chance for it to swim away. In some cases, \n\njuveniles and pre-spawning or sexually immature organisms are caught. In the circumstance  where  \n\nthese  individuals  are  disposed  of  immediately,  there  is  still  a  risk  of mortality prior to spawning \n\nif the species is sensitive and damage that the gear has done is considerable. Discarding can severely \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\naffect recruitment in fisheries resulting in a loss of reproduction rate when a large number of discards \n\nare commercial juveniles (Jensen et al., 1988). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.4.1. Schematic of indirect or direct mortality resulting from bycatch and discards (Source: Gaspar and \n\nChicharo, 2007). \n \n\nAs mentioned before, some of these discards are supplying the food web with easy prey for \n\npredatory organisms such as seagulls and dolphins that trail the boat. Discards are believed to be \n\ndangerous for seabirds as this type of food is considered to be junk food for them (\u00d6sterblom et al., \n\n2008). However, some species of gulls (Audouin\u2019s gulls) receive a substancial part of their energy from \n\nfishery discards during the breeding season (Oro and Ruiz, 1997). In a study where reduction of \n\ndiscards for seabirds was conducted, researchers observed there was no attraction to the boat, \n\nresulting in decreased mortality rates due to a decline in seabird - gear interaction (Granadeiro et \n\nal., 2011). With mammals, dolphins are known to become entangled in trammel and gill nets, often \n\nbeing severely injured and possibly dying (Ross et al., 2010). Fishermen have reported dolphins that \n\ndestroy their nets and would create competition between themselves and the fishermen resulting in \n\ndeliberate killing of dolphins by angered fishermen (Gazo et al., 2007). Trammel nets have been \n\nreported as being responsible for a mortality rate of 60% ofsea turtles caught in the net, by incidental \n\ncapture of the loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in places such as Sardinia, Italy (Cambie, 2011). \n\nAttempts to reduce bycatch of these important species have been successful in some cases while in \n\nothers they have affected commercial catch rates. In Mexico\u2019s Baja California peninsula, researchers \n\nattempted to use visual cues to reduce sea turtle bycatch in static gear by using shark shapes which did \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nin fact reduce turtle bycatch by 54%, but also decreased target catch by 45%, while chemical light \n\nsticks did not affect the target catch and reduced sea turtle catch rates by 60% (Wang et al., 2010). \n\nUltimately, important prey is being taken away from commercial species, resulting in increased \n\ncompetition and a decrease in population size as the species\u2019 food beings to disappear. Various gears \n\nhave different results regarding the catch of fish; for trawls targeting haddock, discard related \n\nmortality can range from 9-35% versus haddock caught by seine nets which is less than 10%. In \n\ngear such as hook and lines, Salmo species have a post release mortality of 0% even with visible stress \n\nwhile the pacific salmon caught in static gear such as gillnets have a mortality rate of 80% due to stress \n\n(Chopin and Arimoto 1995). Some species are less sensitive than others to mortality after catch. For \n\nexample, if caught as bycatch, sharks and rays have higher survival rates than most teleost\u2019s \n\n(Rodr\u00edguez-Cabello et al., 2005). \n\nBycatch has an impact on VMEs, or Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems. Passive gear, such as \n\ntrammel nets, can result in entangling of branching corals (High, 1998) and upon hauling, coral will be \n\nbroken and torn out of the sea floor. There is also the possibility of abrasions and crushing of \n\nbenthic fauna (Lewis et al., 2009). Corals and marine plants serve as protection to many species and \n\nserve as nurseries while benthic fauna is often responsible for bottom up control in that these species \n\nserve an important part in the food web. VME\u2019s are defined by their uniqueness, which include rare species; \n\ncritical feeding, spawning, or nursey habitats; fragility or easily degraded from human interactions; late \n\nmaturations or slow growth; and low levels of natural disturbances (Donaldson et al., 2010). Upon \n\ninteraction with static gear, these areas are highly susceptible to deterioration, resulting in a significant \n\ndecrease in biodiversity. \n\n \n\n1.5 Discards in the Algarve  \n\nThe percentage and abundance of both bycatch and commercial catch depends on the type of \n\ngear as well as the environment it is fishing in. Longlining, has a set number of hooks and therefore \n\nonly a set number of organisms can be caught while trawls are usually large and because they \n\nmove along with the boat they are more likely to catch a larger variety of species. Static gear such as \n\ngill nets and trammel nets are more variable as their size selection is variable. In the Algarve, the mean \n\ndiscard rate for trammel nets was reported at 13% of total catch in comparison to other gear including \n\ndemersal purse seines and fish trawls that had discard rates of 20% and 62% respectively (Borges et \n\nal., 2001). In another study based on multiple gears in Portugal, trawls and purse seiners were \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nresponsible for 90% of discards (mainly fish and cephalopods) and trammel nets followed with 81% \n\nin discards (Borges et al., 2001). According to Kelleher (2005) the highest global discard percentages \n\nare due to shrimp trawls, ranging from 0-96%; demersal finfish trawls, ranging 0.5-83%; and gillnets \n\n(including trammel nets), ranging from 0-66%. \n\nCommercial catch and bycatch is also dependent on the season. In a trammel net study \n\nconducted in Setubal and Sesimbra,  Sepia officinalis was caught in higher numbers during \n\nautumn and winter while Solea senegalensis was more prevalent during spring and summer but, was \n\ncaught year round (Batista, 2009). The most widely discarded invertebrate species in winter and \n\nsummer is Phallusia mammillata and during Autumn it is Sphaerechinus granularis (Gon\u00e7alves et al., \n\n2008). In a study based on five different m\u00e9tiers in Algarve, Portugal, trammel nets were responsible \n\nfor the discardg  of 78 species (Erzini et al., 2002). Common commercial  species  in  Portugal  \n\nconsist  of  cuttlefish  (Sepia  officialis),  and  soles  Solea senegalensis which are discarded at \n\n6% and 12.4%, respectively, while bycatch commonly consists of Scomber japonicus, Sardina \n\npilchardus, and Boops boops (Gon\u00e7laves et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n1.6 Bycatch Problems and Solutions  \n\nBycatch and discarding creates a problem both socioeconomically and environmentally. It is a \n\nnuisance for fishermen as their gear is affected negatively as mentioned previously. In some \n\ncircumstances, a bycatch species has spines, scales, or teeth that are caught in the net and the only \n\nway to clean the net is by ripping these species out, leaving holes and ripped up mesh that will no  \n\nlonger  be  effective  in  catching the  target  species.  Researchers have already begun attempting to \n\nresolve issues with top predator species such as dolphins, which destroy nets, by using pingers on \n\ntrammel nets; while dolphins did not decrease in approaching the net, there was 87% less holes in the \n\nnets with pingers (Gazo et al., 2007). Cleaning the net of bycatch species forces the fishermen to lose \n\ntime that would otherwise be used on cleaning the net of commercial fishes and arriving in the port \n\nearlier to the morning auction. \n\nCurrently, legislation is seeking to encourage the development of technologies that can result in  \n\nelimination  of  discards.  There have been  several  approaches  to  management  of harvesting \n\ncommercial catch while decreasing bycatch and discards and showing success. When conducting  \n\nresearch  on  bycatch  reduction using a trammel net rigged with a guarding net in the Northeastern \n\nMediterranean, G\u00f6k\u00e7e et al. (2016) reported that the \u2018ANet\u2019 or the alternative net (modified net) \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nexhibited 83% less bycatch than the \u2018CNet\u2019 (commercial net) and only 16% less commercial catch. \n\nOverall, the modification produced a 1.5% decrease in catches of the main target species, green tiger \n\nprawn, Penaeus semisulcatus, and 66-85% decrease in the three main bycatch species (invasive \n\nswimming crab, Charybdes longicollis; mantis shrimp, Rissoides desmaresti; and the blue crab, \n\nPortunus pelagicus). A study in the Eastern Mediterranean in Antalya Bay, found that a smaller mesh \n\nsize for the inner panel (40mm or 44 mm) resulted in higher amount of commercial catch in both \n\nabundance and biomass for the species like Pagellus acarne in which 164 individuals (6.209 grams) \n\nwere caught in the 44 mm net versus 774 individuals (31.219 kg) in the 40 mm net. There was also a \n\ndecrease in bycatch, halving the abundance and biomass of individuals for species like Citharus \n\nlinguatula where 70 individuals (2.079 kg) were caught in the 44 mm net versus 35 individuals (0.959 \n\nkg) in the 40 mm net (Olguner and Deval, 2013).  \n\nIn Izmir Bay of the Aegean coast in Turkey, researchers added a guarding net to the common \n\ntrammel net being used in the area to raise it from the muddy bottom focusing on the commercial \n\nfishery of the prawn Melicertus kerathurus (Metin et al., 2009). The alternative net went through two \n\nrounds of experiments because in the first there were too may floats resulting in a 17% decrease in \n\ncommercial catch. However, in the second experiment there was only a 0.99% decrease in the prawn \n\ncatch for significant reductions in the three main bycatch species: crabs (50.63%), mantis shrimp \n\n(17.33%), and purple dye murex (25.92%). The results thus show that a guarding net in this area can \n\nreduce bycatch and highlights the importance of height of the guarding net regarding bycatch reduction. \n\nAnother project in Izmir Bay regarding trammel net discard reduction focused on Mullus spp in \n\nseagrass meadows (Aydin et al., 2013). Discard rates decreased 54.7% in the first experiment and \n\n62.8% in the second experiment using a selvedge. The selvedge reduced the discard of three main \n\nbycatch species (Hexaplex trunculus, Bolinus brandaris, Maja spp) which ultimately avoided damage \n\nto the net caused by these species.  In the Kerala state in India, researchers surveyed net usage along 16 \n\ndistricts and noticed trammel nets being used for soles, mackerel, and prawn during different periods of \n\nthe year, signifying the awareness that switching gear is efficient and that it ensures targeting of \n\nspecific species and avoidance of juveniles and bycatch (Thomas and Hridayanathan 2006). \n\n \n\n1.7 The Greca net goals  \n\nThere is still a significant amount of information that all fisheries require in order to make \n\ninformative decisions regarding future management. In conclusion, scientific research is needed to gain \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nthe knowledge that will enable proper maintenance for a sustainable fishery for not only \n\nenvironmental purposes but, economic ones as well. The goal of this project is to produce enough \n\nevidence to convince fishermen to switch from the standard trammel net to the modified trammel net. The \n\nmodified net\u2019s success will be proven if there is no reduction in commercial catch compared to the \n\nstandard net while the bycatch  is reduced significantly.  The reduction  of bycatch  will be d e p e n de n t  on \n\nthe greca\u2019s design (the selvedge). For the commercial catch to remain unaffected, the target species \n\nmust be compatible with the new design. With less bycatch, the time to clean the net will also be \n\nreduced. This is important for fishermen as they can focus on commercial species, get to port before \n\nthe morning auction, and less bycatch species in the net can result in more space in the net for \n\ncommercial catch. A reduction in time for cleaning the net of bycatch species means less time on the \n\nboat and quicker setting time for the next day. Goals also include the reduction of bycatch in terms of \n\nthe ecosystem. This ultimately can prevent severe population collapse in key species that either serve \n\nas food for others in the food web or serve as control for species that are their food source. With a \n\ndecline in species that are important food sources for commercial species, there is a potential collapse \n\nof these fisheries which can be devastating to the economy. The specific objectives of this research \n\nwere: 1)  to compare a standard trammel net with a modified trammel net (greca) in terms of catch \n\ncompostion, bycatch and discard species, 2) compare the economic yield of the standard net with that of \n\nthe modified net, 3) compare the time needed to clean the different nets (removal of bycatch and \n\ndiscard species), and 4) compare net damage in the standard trammel net and the greca net.  \n\n \n\n2.Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n2.1 Net Design  \n \n\nThe standard trammel net consists of three layers of netting: a small mesh inner panel and two \n\nlarge mesh outer panels. The modified net has a single layer of netting 3 meshes high between the \n\ntrammel net and the footrope termed \u201cgreca\u201d. The difference can be seen in Figure 2.1.1. The experimental \n\nnets consisted of fifteen 45-meter nets of each type tied together. There were  three standard and three \n\nmodified nets interchanging five times giving (SN1...SN5 &amp; GN1..GN5), with two meters in between \n\neach section to reduce bias (guiding of fish), making up a total of approximately 1.5 kilometers of net. \n\nIn the standard net (Figure 2.1.2), the inner panel has a stretched mesh size of 120 of 0.30 mm diameter \n\n(0.30 \u00d8) monofilament. The net is 40 meshes high, or 4.80 m stretched mesh, by 995 meshes long, or \n\n119.4m stretched mesh. The floatline was 52 m long and made of PE with 7mm in diameter. The \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nnumber of poach lines between the floats was 10. The leadline was 55.2m long and made of PE, or \n\npolyester, (braided line with lead) with 7mm in diameter. The upper hanging ratio and lower hanging \n\nratio were 0.43 and 0.46, respectively and were calculated as follows:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe number of meshes per poach line for both upper and lower was five (five meshes on the \n\nbottom and five meshes at the top). The material for the floats were polyethylene and were 50 mm in \n\nlength The outer panels have a stretched mesh size of 600mm of 0.60 mm diameter (0.60 \u00d8) \n\nmonofilament. For the outer panel, the number of meshes high was 3, or 1.8 m stretched mesh, by 199 \n\nmeshes long, or 119.4m. The hanging ratio for both upper and lower was identical to the inner panel. \n\nThe vertical slack was 2.7 and was calculated by the following: \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.1.1. The technical plan for the standard net. (PA, Polyamide; PE, Polyester; PP, Polypropylene) \n \n\nThe modified net (Figure 2.1.2) had similar measurements for the outer and inner panels. The \n\nselvedge, or greca, (Figure 2.1.3) consisted of a single panel 3 meshes high, of 140 mm stretched mesh \n\n(210/12 PA). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1.2. The technical plan for the modified net. (PA, Polyamide; PE, Polyester; PP, Polypropylene) \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1.3. The greca part of the modified net. \n \n\nThe two m\u00e9tiers that this research focused on are Solea species and Sepia officinalis. Solea \n\nspecies was the initial m\u00e9tier during autumn and S. officinalis was caught in winter time when the \n\nwater temperature decreased.  \n \n\n \n\n2.2 Experimental fishing trials \n \n\nFishing was conducted off the coast of Algarve with the fishing vessel (Alfonsinho) departing \n\nfrom the port of Quarteria, Portugal (Figure 2.2.1). Twenty sampling trips were conducted f r om \n\nO c t o b e r  2 0 1 6 t o Fe b r u a r y 2 0 1 7 .  The nets were set at dawn and hauled in the next morning; \n\nthis usually occurred before sunrise with the goal of keeping the soak time (the time the net is in the \n\nwater) standard (approximately 24 hours). The two times that were crucial to record were the setting \n\ntime the day before and the hauling time the day of sampling. It is important to note that sampling was \n\nnot conducted under conditions of high biomasses of the algae Cystoeria in the water as it blocked the \n\nnet and prevented any catch from occurring. Two GoPros were set up on board to use as references and \n\nto record possible overlook of species in the net. GoPro videos were used later to evaluate the time \n\nrequired to clean the two different nets. The net was pulled in using a hydraulic hauler.  Each marine  \n\norganism  caught  in  the  net  was identified (to the species level) and measured, using either a ruler \n\nconnected to a stable metal platform (ichthyometer) or if the species was too large with a measuring \n\ntape, and registered as bycatch or commercial. If the organism  was considered \u201cbycatch\u201d  or simply \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\ndiscard,  as some commercial species can also be considered discard, then the reason was noted. \n\nSome reasons that are possible include too small to sell, scavenged, rotting, or contains parasites. For \n\neach species the net type was recorded. Futhermore, for species caught in the modified net, it was \n\nrecorded whether it was caught in the upper trammel net part or the \u201cgreca\u201d part. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2.1. The location where experimental fishing trials took place. The shaded area, off the port of Quarteria, \n\nPortugal, is where the experimental fishing trials took place. \n\n \n\n \n\nEach fish was removed from the net manually by the fishermen. Certain bycatch species \n\nwere killed in order to clean the net and t o  continue h a u l i n g  a t  a moderate pace. For \n\ninstance, the sea urchin (Sphaerochinus granularis) was usually crushed by the fisherman, while the \n\nsea snail (Cymbium olla) was ripped out of its shell. Trachinus draco and the electric ray Torpedo \n\ntorpedo had their heads crushed to avoid injuries. Special care is taken with species such as \n\nRhizomata pulmo, the barrel jellyfish, which was carefully taken out to avoid stings as they are quite \n\nlarge organisms. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nGPS tracking was used to note the waypoints (where each net is set). Wind conditions \n\n(recorded onboard), water conditions (including water temperatures, salinity, dissolved oxygen in \n\nboth percentage and mg/L format, and total dissolved solids), sunrise and sunset time were also \n\nrecorded in order to track external condition. This data was also used to compare the catch based on \n\nthe differences in daily conditions. \n\n \n\n2.3 Net Damage Assessment  \n\nThe damage to the net was accounted for by counting every visible hole across the entire 1.5 km \n\nof net at the end of the experimental trials. As the net was pulled onto the deck and onto a black tarp for \n\neasy visualization, four observers checked the section of the net for holes and it was noted in which net \n\ntype (modified or standard) the hole was in. Upon spotting a hole, a 20 cm ruler was placed on the hole \n\nto observe the width/diameter and a picture was taken for later analysis (Figure 2.3.1). Each hole was \n\nobserved using three factors: 1) which layer the hole occurred (greca layer, inner layer, or outer layer), \n\n2) where the net occurred (either the lower half of the net or the upper half of the net), and 3) size of the \n\nnet (hole size &lt;20 cm was considered small and hole size > 20 cm was considered large). This \n\ninformation was used in accounting for the differences in catch between the modified greca net and the \n\nstandard net.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3.1. Net damage assessment with the 20 cm ruler on a hole on the upper layer and inner mesh.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n2.4 Analysis \n\n \n\nThe weight of each fish was calculated using weight -length relationships, in order to estimate \n\nvalue of the catch based on average selling price for the day and the catch biomass. In order to do \n\nthis, the equation below was used: \n\n \n \n\nWhere a and b are parameters for the weight-length relationship and given based on country by \n\nfishbase.org for  each  individual  species.  For the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  Portuguese \n\ncoefficients were used, Algarve if possible, otherwise Portugal in general or if neither was an option, a \n\nMediterranean country. The weight of octopi (Octopus vulgaris) was estimated by the fishermen. The \n\nother commercial invertebrates such as the spider crab (Maja brachydactyla) and cuttlefish (Sepia \n\nofficialis) were weighed on board measured to for weight to length relationships. The total catches (kg) \n\nof each species were converted to value in euros using the average price per kg obtained at the f i s h  \n\nauction in Quarteria, Portugal (Doca Pesca). The weight of each bycatch species was also  \n\nrecorded to compare the two net types. \n\nAnalysis was conducted using PRIMER and PERMANOVA  in order to evaluate differences \n\nbetween the catch compositions of the two different types of trammel net. The idea is to compare \n\nd i s c a r d s ,  commercial catch, and the combined cath data between the two net types. Data sheets \n\nwere prepared in excel using pivot tables. Trip number and net type ( e.g. T16: T -standard net, 16 - trip \n\n16) were assigned as the samples samples and the species were assigned variables. There were a total of \n\n6 excel files: 1) commercial catch abundance, 2) commercial catch biomass, 3) bycatch abundance, 4) \n\nbycatch biomass, 5) combined catch abundance, and 6) combined catch biomass. Each of these files \n\nwere input into PRIMER and analyzed using one of three main factors: target catch (10 trips where sole \n\nspecies were target and 10 trips where cuttlefish were targeted), season (15 trips where sampling was \n\nconducted during fall and 5 trips where sampling was conducted during winter), and depth that was \n\ndecided after sampling using bathmetric ranges (10-20 meters was the range for 12 trip and 20-30 m \n\nwas the range for 8 trips).  Net type was also used as a factor but, only for the combined catch data and \n\nfor two-way PERMANOVA s, to observe the interaction effect, which included the following: net type \n\nagainst depth, net type against season, and net type against target catch. Cluster analysis,  MDS (Multi-\n\nDemensional Scaling), Anisom (Analysis in Similarity), and SIMPER (Similarity Percentage \n\nAnalsysis) were conducted with the PRIMER software both with and without square root \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\ntransformation. It was later decided that analysis based on the square root transformation was more \n\nappropriate, giving lower positive stress levels and higher significance in PERMANOVA  and \n\nANOSIM. Two-way PERMANOVA s were used to compare the interaction effect between net type \n\nand the three main factors.  \n\n \n\n3. Results \n\n \n\n3.1 Abundance  \n \n\n When comparing the abundance of commercial species that were landed and sold between the \n\nstandard and the modified net (greca) it appears that 19 species were either caught in one net  or the \n\nother, with 21 species caught by both nets (Table 3.1.1). The overall ratio (total number of commercial \n\nspecies caught) for greca to standard net was 0.539, showing that the standard net caught more than the \n\ngreca net. At the species level this occurred 15 times, with the smallest ratios being less than 0.4 \n\noccurring for three sole species: Microchirus azevia, Pegusa Lascaris, and Solea senegalensis. If the \n\nratio is more than one then the standard net caught less of the species than the greca net and this occured \n\nfour times with the highest ratio being 1.5 for the species Mullus surmuletus, followed by a ratio of 1.4 \n\nfor the species Raja undulata.  \n\nTable 3.1.1.

If the ratio of greca to standard net is less than one, then the standard \n\nnet caught more discarded individuals. If the ratio of greca to standard net is more than one, then the \n\ngreca net caught more discarded individuals. The ratio of greca trammel net catches to standard trammel \n\nnet catches in numbers for commercial discards was 0.432, while for bycatch it was 0.584, and the \n\noverall ratio was 0.557. The two most discarded commercial species were Pagellus erythrinus with a \n\nratio of 0.457 and Microchirus azevia with a ratio of 0.382; both species were discarded in higher \n\nnumbers in the standard net. Over 200 individuals were caught for three bycatch species. \n\nChelidonichthys obscurus, with 288 individuals caught and a ratio of 0.378, was caught more often in \n\nthe standard net than the greca net.

For abundance (Figure 3.3.1a), it is noted that trip 19\u2019s \n\ncatch from both the greca and standard had a resemblance level of less than 30. It was later observed \n\nwhen focusing on discard and bycatch biomass and abundance that the two net types were outliers. This \n\nis due to the fact that more than 50% of the catch was commercial and therefore trip 19 as a whole is \n\nexcluded from the data sets using strictly discards and bycatch. Trip 9\u2019s catch from the greca net was \n\nalso considered an outlier with a resemblance level of less than 20. This is because the greca net did not \n\ncatch any commercial individuals during that trip and was therefore excluded from the data sets using \n\nstrictly commercial catch. Similar results can be seen in biomass (Figure 3.3.1b), with a resemblance \n\nlevel of around 40 for trip 19\u2019s greca and standard net catch . Although trip 9\u2019s catch in the greca net had \n\na resemblance level less than 20, it has a similarity with trip 1\u2019s catch from the greca net and this is \n\nbecause only 9.8% of the catch was considered commercial. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.3.1a.

Discussion \n\n \n\n4.1 Commercial Catch: Greca vs Standard    \n\n \n\n In regards to the legislation \u2018A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in \n\nEuropean fisheries (COM, 2007)\u2019, this modification to the trammel net resulted in a loss of earnings \n\nrevenue, with the catches of the modified nets worth only 61.8% of those of the standard nets earnings. \n\nWhen observing commercial catch, the greca net caught 53.9% of that caught in the standard trammel net \n\nregarding abundance and 64.3% of that in the standard trammel net in biomass which is more important \n\nas it also indicates  higher similarity in revenue. The most significant decrease in commercial catch was \n\nseen among the sole species: Microchirus azevia (64 individuals in greca trammel net and 177 \n\nindividuals in the standard trammel net), Solea senegalensis (11 individuals in the greca versus 32 in the \n\nstandard), and Pegusa lascaris (10 individuals in the greca and 28 individuals in the standard). When \n\nobserving revenue, two of the three most valuable species for the standard net were two sole species: \n\nMicrochirus azevia (\u20ac237.33) and Solea senegalensis (\u20ac192.60). Microchirus azevia that was caught in \n\nthe greca trammel net produced a revenue 36.86% that of the standard net with \u20ac87.48, followed by the \n\nsecond target species Sepia officinalis, which was a less valuable species in the standard net in \n\ncomparison to the soles, with \u20ac77.30. Compared to previous studies such as in Izmir Bay, the net was not \n\nconsidered successful as these studies were geared towards target catches that were pelagic species versus \n\nthe initial target species which were demersal (soles species) for the first half of sampling. In Antalya \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nBay, none of the commercial species are demersal; they were considered bycatch, and with teleosts as the \n\ncommercial catch, the selvedge net was considered successful (Oluger &amp; Deval 2013). However, the \n\ngreca trammel net\u2019s second most valuable species was Sepia officinalis which was the second target \n\nspecies for the second half of sampling and the value of the catch was nearly as much as that of the \n\nstandard net. This year was not a good year for this cuttlefish species as waters in the Algarve were \n\nconsidered warm until the end of fall and therefore the cuttlefish season was short and unproductive. \n\nHowever, the greca trammel net did catch the European squid (Loligo vulgaris) which is a high value, \n\nrelatively rare species.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Discards: Greca vs Standard   \n\nGreca trammel net catches were 45.3% of those of the standard trammel net in commercial \n\ndiscards abundance and 57.7% in bycatch abundance. Bycatch is a problem in terms of taking up net area \n\nthat can be used to catch commercial species especially if a certain bycatch is being caught in relatively \n\nlarge quantities. There were three main bycatch species. Longfin gurnards (Chelidonichthys obscurus) of \n\nwhich 288 individuals were caught and the greca net caught 37.8% of what the standard net caught. This \n\nspecies is possibly attracted to the net as its diet is rich in Amphipods (Serrano et al. 2003) and \n\ncommercial species that were discarded generally were scavenged by amphipods. Since there was less \n\ncommercial discard biomass in the greca net, it could possibly correlate to the significant reduction in this \n\nbycatch species in the greca net. This is an important reduction as the longfin gurnard has many spines \n\nthat would be entangled in the net which could cause damage to the net, possibly explaining why in the \n\nstandard net nearly all of the holes found were in the upper part of the net, many of which were in the \n\ninner layer where this species was often caught in. The second bycatch species with the highest individual \n\ncount was the Atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber colias) with 233 individuals, of which the greca net \n\ncaught 128.4% that of what the standard net caught. However, this species is sometimes considered a \n\ncommercial catch and it did not pose a threat of physical damage to the net. Also, out of the six bycatch \n\nspecies that were timed, it was the species that took the least amount of time on average to be removed \n\nfrom the net. Lastly, the third bycatch species with the highest individual count was the Greater weever \n\n(Trachinus draco), with 202 individuals, of which the greca net caught 66.9% of what the standard net \n\ncaught. The reduction of this species is important due to the danger it poses to the fishermen as it is \n\nvenomous and it was the second most time consuming removal species as it took on average 14.045 \n\nseconds, for a total of nearly an hour of removal time for this species over the course of 20 trips. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nAdditional time is required to smash the head in to prevent onboard injuries which can result in \n\npopulation reductions and as this species is the prey of Brill, or Scophthalmus rhombus (Bagge, 2004) \n\nwhich is a one of the most expensive flatfish at \u20ac13.2 per kilogram, this can possibly disrupt the fishery \n\nfor the species.  \n\nThe discard ratio of the greca to standard net for commercial catch biomass is 0.318 and this was \n\nmost likely due to the fact that less individuals of commercial were caught, although a decrease in \n\ndiscards is a positive step for the legislation to ban discards. The species with the highest discarded \n\nweight in the greca net were Balistes capriscus with 1.859 kg discarded or a loss of \u20ac8.65  and \n\nMicrochirus azevia with 1.465 kg discarded, or a loss of \u20ac13.478. The species with the highest discarded \n\nweight in the standard net were Raja undulata with 5.687 kg , or a loss of \u20ac14.79, Sepia officinalis with \n\n5.508 kg discarded, or a loss of  \u20ac67.19, and Microchirus azevia with 3.601 kg discarded, or a loss of \n\n\u20ac33.10. The majority of discarding commercial species was due to scavenging and parasites. Maja \n\nsquinado was the only species for which multiple individuals were released due to being undersized and \n\nconsidered juveniles. Myliobatis aquila was released because they are considered of little or no value and \n\nare highly vulnerable (Baeta et al., 2010).  A blue shark (Prionace glauca), which is often caught in \n\ndriftnets, was also released as it was considered bycatch and under protection due to its high vulnerability  \n\n(Cavanagh and Gibson, 2007). With dolphins and seagulls trailing the boat, many of the species that \n\ncame onboard alive, were predated on upon entering the water. The greca trammel net caught 80.4% of \n\nthat in the standard net in bycatch biomass. The most significant different was in C. obscurus in which \n\nthe greca net discarded 12.483 kg and the standard trammel net discarded 33.253 kg. The other two main \n\nbycatch species did not have a significant difference in biomass.  \n\nTheoretically, had the net been only used during cuttlefish season and the three main sole species  \n\nwere not targeted, the greca trammel net caught nearly the same amount with a ratio of 0.844 that of the \n\nstandard net. The Atlantic chub mackerel, Scomber colias, although sold commonly in the market, was \n\nconsidered a bycatch species by the fishermen. Had the fishermen who use trammel nets sold the \n\nmackerel species, the ratio of discard abundance in the greca net would drop to 0.463 that of the standard \n\nnet while increasing the commercial abundance in the greca trammel net from 0.539 to 0.698 that of the \n\nstandard trammel net. Therefore, changing the net from standard net used in during the m\u00e9tier of sole \n\nspecies to the greca trammel net during cuttlefish season can possibly result in similar production in \n\nearnings  and even more so if the fishermen using the net would consider selling Atlantic chub mackerel \n\nwhile reducing bycatch significantly.  \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n4.3 Damage in the Net   \n\nConducting net damage assessment gave some insight on the possibility as to why there was a \n\nsignificant reduction in sole species caught in the greca trammel net. There were twice as many holes in \n\nthe greca modified net with the majority in the greca layer and about 60% of the holes had a width or \n\ndiameter larger than 20 centimeters. The greatest difference among the three factors in the standard \n\ntrammel net was placement in the net. Approximately 88% of the holes found in the standard net were in \n\nthe upper half of the net, most likely due to teleost species occurring in higher numbers. In a previous \n\nstudy comparing standard trammel net to a modified trammel net, damage was also assessed but, only \n\nwhether it was in the upper or lower halves of the inner net and disregarding size (G\u00f6k\u00e7e et al., 2016) \n\nwhile another study simply accounted for the size of the hole in the net but not where in the net the hole \n\noccurred (Maccarrone et al. 2014) which can result in missing information as to which commercial and \n\nbycatch species are being affected through modifications. The greca trammel net holes were most likely \n\ndue to two reasons: the material was not strong enough against demersal species with spikes or the \n\nfishermen were less careful as they suspected they would not use the greca net after sampling was \n\nfinished. If the standard net were to make more money but, have more holes which would require fixing \n\nthat is taken away from earnings  then the assessment could be a necessary in convincing fishermen to \n\nchange nets. The cost of the greca trammel net (material and labour) was 105 euros per net  while that of  \n\nthe standard trammel net was only 58 euros per net. Since there were twice as many holes in the greca \n\nnet, twice as expensive as the standard net to construct, and the greca net produced less earnings than the \n\nstandard trammel net,  there was no benefit to calculating the loss in earnings for fixing the net.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Removing Bycatch: Time matters   \n\nRegarding the removal of different species from the nets, it was not possible to time all the \n\nremovals as the videos were either not positioned in a way that would permit viewing of the species being \n\nremoved from the net, not positioned on the fisherman working on a certain species (as it was noticed that \n\neach fishermen had a \u201cspecialty\u201d and were given certain species every time), the GoPro moved during the \n\ntrip, the battery died and therefore cut out. Therefore, there was a possibility of timing of 23 individuals \n\nfor each of the six bycatch species. As previously stated, bycatch removal can be laborious and dangerous \n\nwith no positive return, thus the reduction of these species would reduce overall time spent on species \n\nthat are not earnings able. Rhizostoma pulmo, or the barrel jellyfish, was the most dangerous species \n\nbeing caught in the net as even pieces of the jellyfish left severe stings and was the most time consuming \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nin releasing with an average time of 18.14 seconds. The main problem faced was having to stop hauling \n\nthe net completely to release the jellyfish while it was still in the water. The second most time consuming \n\nspecies was Trachinus draco, as previously stated, due to its\u2019 dangerous venom and spines. The third \n\nmost time consuming was Cymbium olla with an average time of 12.45 seconds, though it poses no threat \n\nthe species must be ripped out of its\u2019 shell which can severally damage the animal directly while \n\nindirectly causing mortality as it is no longer protected and open to predation. The last three species \n\nChelidonichthys obscurus (had their spines laid down), Scomber colias (generally small and easily \n\nremoved), and Porifera spp (ripped apart) were removed at an average time between six and nine \n\nseconds. While the times seem insignificant when looked at in seconds, some of the species took nearly \n\nan hour over the course of only 20 trips to remove individuals and that time accumulates if fishermen are \n\nout on the water five days a week every week of the year.  Furthermore, it is important to note that \n\ncommercial trammel netters fish many kms of nets in a single set (more than 10km for the larger \n\nvessels), which means that considerable amounts of time and manpower are required to remove species \n\nsuch as the weeverfish from the nets if we extrapolate the estimates obtained in this study for only 1.5 \n\nkm of trammel nets.      \n\n \n\n4.5 Factors influencing catch  \n\n Using PRIMER and PERMANOVA +, four factors were used to analyse the results and these \n\nwere: net type (greca trammel net versus standard trammel net), seasonality (fall versus winter), target \n\ncatch (sole species versus cuttlefish), and depth ranges (10-20 m versus 20-30 m). The reason for m\u00e9tier \n\nbeing separated into target catch and season was because there were 15 trips in fall while in winter there \n\nwere only five trips conducted and sole species were targeted the first 10 trips while cuttlefish were \n\ntargeted in the second half of the trips. Therefore season and target species did not coincide. \n\nIt is observed in the MDS plots that the strength of separation is more apparent in commercial \n\ncatch when target species are the factor which is confirmed by ANOSIM and SIMPER which gave \n\nexceptionally high dissimilarities for both abundance and biomass. The results were similar for \n\ncommercial catch when depth was a factor and when overlaying clusters on the MDS plot, there was a \n\nhigher resemblance over the standard trammel nets. Seasonality as a factor for commercial catch \n\nproduced the weakest separation among the two seasons for both abundance and biomass, although \n\nbiomass had a slightly higher dissimilarity level.     \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nFor discard species, the factor target catch had the least effect with moderate separation strength \n\nfor abundance and a weak separation strength for biomass with the weakest dissimilarity for both biomass \n\nand abundance across all three factors. The strongest separation strength was in abundance when the \n\nfactor was depth. Our three main bycatch species vary in depth, S.colias can be found from 0 to 300 \n\nmeters in depth (Vasconcelo et al. 2011), C. obscurus has a range of 0 to 170 meters according to \n\nFishbase, and T. draco has a depth range of 0 to 200 meters (IUNC). Seasonality was important when \n\nobserving what influences catch composition and discards in the Sothern Black Sea, Turkey, where it was \n\nobserved that there was a significant difference in discard species between summer and spring with a \n\nsignificant difference in discard rates when the depth was greater than 30 meter and the highest discards \n\nrates with depth over 16 meter (Kalayci 2014). This is possibly the reason why discard rates were so high \n\nsince 12 out of the 20 trips were in less than 16 meter depth. This is similar for the discard species when \n\nseason was a factor. For both abundance and biomass the strength of separation was moderate with \n\nsimilar dissimilarity levels.  \n\nOverall, the combined species (commercial, commercial discards, and bycatch) displayed clusters \n\nformed among the trips. Examples included modified (M) and standard (T) trammel nets for trips 2,7, and \n\n8 with the strongest similarities across biomass. Interestingly, for trip 7 the two net types were in the \n\nwater the longest, approximately 47 hours due to unexpected bad weather the day it was supposed to be \n\nhauled in; therefore time did not affect the similarity between the net types. The combined data displayed \n\na high dissimilarity and strong separation when target catch and depth were factors with biomass data \n\nhaving slightly higher dissimilarity. However, similar to commercial catch, seasonality as a factor \n\nresulted in moderate separation strength in abundance and weak separation in biomass and the weakest \n\ndissimilarity for both. Two groups were formed among the trips when overlaying the cluster for the data \n\nbased on their depth ranges for both abundance and biomass, although the resemblance level was slightly \n\nhigher regarding the abundance data. In general, a higher resemblance level meant greca trammel nets to \n\nbe in their own group individually. Two-way PERMANOVA  for combined catch data, for both biomass \n\nand abundance, was conducted comparing net type against depth, seasonality, and target catch. The \n\nresults for abundance was that net type had a p-value 0.828, 0.994, and 0.935 respectively meaning that \n\nthe interaction is not significant. For biomass the p-values were 0.386, 0.96, and 0.935 respectively also \n\nindicating that the interaction is not significant.  \n\nWith a discard ban already becoming active across certain parts of Europe, the question is raised \n\nif this will in fact be positive for both the economy and the environment. According to legislating the ban \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nwould include all finfish and crustaceans. There are certain discards of commercial catch that are due to \n\nthe species\u2019 being a juvenile or females are carrying eggs, which prevents the individual from being sold \n\non the market. Certain species\u2019 juveniles and females can be free from any negative impact from \n\ninteracting with the net. This being said, will the ban increase mortality of these individuals as they are \n\nbrought into port or will there be a definition for which live discards are to be returned to the water and \n\nsimply noted? The document claims that exception would be made if the species is known to have a high \n\npercentange in long-term survival. In order to establish this, researchers must conduct survivability tests \n\nand upon agreeing on the support of the results, the information must be given to all the fishermen \n\ninvolved in the specific fishery to avoid an increase in mortality of pre-spawn individuals.  \n\n \n\n5. Conclusions  \n\nThe results suggest that the greca modification, or selvedge net, did not reduce bycatch in the \n\ntrammel net in terms of biomass but, did reduce bycatch in terms of abundance There was, however, a \n\nsignificant difference between the greca trammel net and standard trammel net among commercial \n\ndiscard biomass which meant earnings revenue was lost in the modified net. Overall, the standard \n\ntrammel produced nearly twice as much revenue as the modified net due to the significant difference in \n\ncatches of sole species, especially Microchirus azevia, which is one the most expensive sole species that \n\nwas caught. Although the removals of the most abundant and dangerous bycatch species were timed and \n\nthere was a clear indication of the time fishermen wasted on removing them, to fully assess bycatch \n\ndisrupting the valuable time that could be used for removal of commercial catch, the method must be \n\nexpanded. In order to focus on timing bycatch species, researchers will have to either add hands on deck \n\nto do the timing while on board or consider adding more cameras to capture every fisherman working. It \n\nis equally vital to observe net damage assessment including monetary loss as this can play as a factor in \n\nconvincing fishermen to change nets. It appears that depth had the most effect across the different data \n\nsets and therefore should be further studied with more depth ranges to see at what depth bycatch is more \n\nabundant in order to avoid those depths to reduce bycatch. Since this project was conducted on a \n\ncommercial fishing boat and there was no language barrier between the fishermen and the researchers, it \n\nenabled a positive interaction in order to receive some perspective as well as observing a willingness to \n\nchange. In conclusion, changing gear throughout the year per m\u00e9tier can be proven to be most effective in \n\nterms of economy and the environment. Further research must be conducted in this area with trammel net \n\nmodifications. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n6. References \n \n\n \n\nAlverson D.L., Freeberg M.H., Murawski S.A., Pope J.G., 1994.
