At first, we\n\ndescribe and study the static version of the model, where there is an optimal choice\n\nof variance that induces the highest expected output. Under a piece-rate, this would\n\nbe the choice of the player, but under tournaments, players deviate from this choice\n\nto increase the probability of winning. In the dynamic setting, we show how a\n\nplayer seeks more or less risk as the games comes to the end. Finally, we presents\n\nthe tie-break rule as a way the principal can improve the expected output.\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nMany real-world compensation schemes grant prizes depending on agent\u2019s performance\n\nrelative to others. This situation is called tournaments in economics. There are a wide\n\nvariety of situations where we can find tournaments-like compensations. Students are\n\ngraded relatively to their peers, and those who have good grades can be benefited directly\n\nby scholarships and grants, or indirectly through networking that became available due\n\nto the good grades. Research and development can also be thought as a tournament,\n\nwhere the firm that submit the most attractive proposal is rewarded by a contract. The\n\nelections, when candidates run for a position in the government by competing during\n\ntheir campaign. The investment flow in the financial market, where the hedge funds\n\nthat perform better receive inflows of new investment money. A loan officer who choose\n\ndifferent projects and those who perform better can be promoted. The practice of law,\n\nwhere attorneys compete to each other during a trial representing their clients and being\n\nevaluated by their performance in other to win a legal dispute. The large salaries of\n\nexecutives may provide incentives for all individuals in the firm who, with hard labor,\n\nmay win one of the coveted top positions. Competition among employees within a firm is\n\n\n\n12\n\namong the most widespread ways to provide incentives and granting higher salary, bonus\n\nand promotions.\n\nThe contract theory literature has embraced tournaments as a descriptive model\n\nof incentives within firms. Workplace contests are among the most common motivating\n\napplications of the theoretical tournament literature. Tournaments among workers can\n\nmitigate incentive problems when the effort of workers is unobservable. A key idea un-\n\nderlying tournament theory is that there are clear winners and losers, and the rewards\n\nare usually indivisible, so the knowledge of it provides the incentives agents need to effort\n\ntowards firms\u2019 goals, if the mechanism is well set. The incentive comes from the rational-\n\nity of the players who seek to maximize their individual utility by increasing the chance\n\nof winning a prize. In contrast with other forms of remuneration, such as piece rates \u2013\n\nwhere players are paid according to their production \u2013, tournaments may involve lower\n\ninformation costs. It is generally cheaper to track the relative performance levels rather\n\nthan to monitor absolute performance levels, especially when it involves few competitors.\n\nFor example, PhD programs and employers skim through the information available of the\n\napplicants, and carefully evaluate only the very top of them. This is especially true when\n\nemployees are compared in order to be rewarded, since it can isolate the common shocks\n\nthat might occurred during the evaluation period. The piece rate could provide the wrong\n\ncompensation for players\u2019 effort, or the employer would need to be informed about the\n\nmarket conditions before cross off the aggregate shock term from their performance. The\n\nrelative performance evaluation removes the risk of common uncertainty, so it can reduce\n\nthe amount of money paid to players, since it also work as an insurance. Both players\n\nand principal know the maximum and the least amount of money they will spend/earn.\n\nAlthough tournaments offers many advantages in different contexts, it can also be\n\ndangerous when it consists in a multi-period tournament. A dynamic tournament can\n\nprovide the wrong incentives for players to exert effort. In many real-world situation,\n\ntournaments are played in a dynamic background. Sports is the most common example,\n\nwhere players competes over time and at each instant of time, they know whether they\n\nare leading or lagging in a game. We can also find examples in the labor market, where\n\nsalespeople competing for a bonus or promotion are subject to a tournament that takes\n\ninto account the whole months sales, and at each day or week, players are informed about\n\nhis and the others sales level. The salesperson who is behind his peers can be discourage to\n\nexert effort, since it will be unlikely that he can overcome them and it will be more costly\n\nto work hard enough for reach them. The theory shows that if players are evaluated over a\n\nmulti-period tournament, and at each period, they learn their relative performance, it can\n\ndiscourages effort by players, once the probability of winning reduces when an opponent\n\nhas an advantage. In this case, the underdog may reduce his effort in the game because\n\nthe marginal effect over the probability of winning is reduced and exerting effort is costly.\n\n\n\n13\n\nNevertheless, effort may not be the only choice an agent has while competing in a\n\ntournament. In sports, a coach and his team can choose different levels of risk in a game,\n\nfor example, in a soccer match the team losing the game can switch a defense player for\n\nan offensive player to increase the probability of scoring a goal. We can also observe it\n\nin other sports, like in a hockey game, when a team switch the goalie for a line player,\n\nor in car racing, where the driver can choose risky paths to overcome someone ahead of\n\nhim. Not only in sports we can observe it, but also in many other situations, like labor\n\nmarket and financial market. An employee can exert risky tasks in order to increase his\n\nchance to be promoted, like a loan officer that selects different projects to finance and his\n\nreward depends on the return of his loans compare to the other officers. An investment\n\nfund that balances its portfolio based on expected return and risk. A CEO can affect the\n\nriskiness of the company\u2019s production and profit, based on his choice of research project,\n\nthe kind of employee he selects and the market he would like to explore, in addition to\n\ndeciding how hard they will work.\n\nIn the investment funds industry, for example, firms face a trade-off between ex-\n\npected return and risk of their portfolio. It is also possible that two different portfolios\n\nhave the same expected return, but different volatility. There might be an optimal way to\n\nbalance the portfolio, in terms of expected return adjusted by the risk of it. However, in a\n\ntournament players can be encouraged to seek more risk than the one that generates the\n\nhighest expected return, in order to increase the probability of wining during a dynamic\n\ncompetition. Funds are evaluated periodically, and when it lacks performance relative\n\nto other funds, it may have incentives to deviate from the optimal choice of expected\n\nreturn and increase the risk of their portfolio in order to increase its probability of being\n\nthe top performer and thus receiving larger amount of investment flow. We can also see\n\nthis the trade-off between risk and expected output in other activities, for example, an\n\nadvertisement sales, in which salespeople spend their time contacting the usual clients or\n\nthey can spend time in prospecting new clients.\n\nIn this paper we study a tournament situation in which players must choose how\n\nspend their time in different activities. Each activity has an expected output and volatility\n\nthat generated the trade-off between risk and expected return. In the literature of risk\n\ntaking in tournament, the choice of risk is costless, so players increase the variance as\n\nmuch as possible in order to reduce the marginal gain from effort and thus avoid making\n\nany costly effort, the so-called risky-lazy equilibrium. Some authors work with a binary\n\nchoice of variance to avoid this equilibrium. In our setting, players have a time constrain\n\nand must choose how to spend their time between two activities. Both activities have\n\nstochastic output, but one of them is riskier. In the static setting, we found that when a\n\nplayer has some advantage, they would deviate from the way that generates the maximum\n\nexpected output. By doing it, players would be decreasing or increasing their product\n\n\n\n14\n\nvolatility seeking to increase their probability of winning. Our main goal is to model the\n\ndynamic behavior during a tournament. In a dynamic setting, we found that players\u2019\n\nbehavior towards risk evolves overtime, and as the game is near the end, players will seek\n\nmore risk if there are losing, and will avoid risk if they are leading. To the best of our\n\nknowledge, this behavior was not modeled yet, though it is a common wisdom.\n\nNext section we will survey the related literature about tournament theory with risk\n\ntaking. Section 1.3 we describe the model and compute the equilibrium for the static case.\n\nSections 1.3.4 and 1.4 we describe the tournament with two and ? periods, respectively.\n\nThe Section 1.5 we consider the static case again, and discuss the assumption about the\n\nsymmetric expected output function and what would happen if we relax this assumption.\n\nWe also present a tie-break rule, so in order to win the prize they must perform much\n\nmore than their opponent. We show numerically how the principal can improve players\u2019\n\noutput by setting correctly the tie-break rule.\n\n1.2 Related Literature\n\nThe formal study of this reward structure has started with Lazear and Rosen (1981),\n\nin a labor market model. They provide an alternative model to understand why some\n\nemployees earns much more after a promotion, even though they perform a similar job\n\nwithout increasing his marginal productivity. The idea is that players can be encouraged\n\nto effort by competing against their peers for a promotion or wage rise. Their paper shows\n\nthat tournament schemes can implement first-best levels of effort, when agents are risk\n\nneutral and the prizes are carefully chosen.\n\nThis type of contract is commonly used in the labor market, so economists have been\n\ntrying to understand why. Green and Stokey (1983) provide us two initial reasons why\n\ntournament contracts are so common, besides the fact that using tournaments requires less\n\ninformation. In their model, risk averse players competes in a rank order contract, where\n\nthe principal optimally determines the prizes. They show that under a sufficiently diffuse\n\ncommon shock, the use of tournaments dominates the optimal independent contracts,\n\nsince tournaments allow the principal to filter out the common shock. In addition, when\n\nthe number of agents increase and the principal cannot observe the common shock and\n\nuses a rank order contract can do as well as a principal could do when he observes the\n\ncommon shock and uses an independent optimal contract. Although these cases seems\n\nto be extreme, Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1983) show that in a contest with two risk neutral\n\nplayers, the first best optimum can be obtained by choosing appropriately the prizes,\n\nand also show that even a two-player contest can dominate the individual linear payment\n\nschedule when players are independent. The authors also present more properties about\n\nthe second best solution. Tournament-like contracts can induce players to effort more\n\n\n\n15\n\nthan they do in the first best solution, but it would require the principal to compensate\n\nthem in order encourages them to participate in the contest. Furthermore, introducing\n\na tie-break rule, it is possible to improve the tournament solution with respect to the\n\nprincipal outcome.\n\nHowever, in the real world the effort is not the only possible choice that workers\n\nhave. Sometimes agents can influence both the spread of distribution of the output and\n\nthe distribution mean. For example, a loan officer chooses projects with different expected\n\nreturns and risks, managers can choose innovative or conservative technology strategies\n\nand fund managers can choose the riskiness and expected returns of their portfolio. To\n\nthe best of our knowledge, Bronars (1987) was the first to consider the idea of player\n\nmanipulating the risk to increase the probability of winning. The first published paper\n\nabout risk taking in tournament is Hvide (2002), which studies the incentives for risk\n\nseeking by the identical players in a symmetric equilibrium. Since the choice of risk\n\nis costless in his model, players choose the maximum variance in order to reduce the\n\ncostly effort they must do to overcome the opponent. Increasing variance in a symmetric\n\ncase will reduce the incentives to do a costly effort, since the marginal increase in the\n\nprobability of winning by increasing effort is low. Therefore, when players are identical,\n\nthis compensation scheme induces a \u201crisky-lazy\u201d equilibrium, where both players choose\n\ninfinity variance and zero effort.\n\nTwo papers that studied the asymmetry of player are Kra?kel and Sliwka (2004),\n\nand Kra?kel (2008), by considering different players\u2019 abilities. They introduce a two-stage\n\nmodel, where players choose the risk level, which is costless, and then the costly effort.\n\nAccording to them, the choice of variance has two effects: (i) the effort effect, which\n\nis the reduction of the importance of the effort due to the larger level of noise in the\n\noutput, and hence, players can reduce their effort level; and (ii) likelihood effect, which\n\nis the change in the probability of winning related to the choice of risk. They show that\n\nif the leader has a large enough advantage, he would chose low-risk strategy, while the\n\nunderdog\u2019s choice depends on the cost of effort. When the cost is high, the underdog\n\nwill choose high-risk strategy. If the advantage is not so large, the underdog will always\n\nchoose high-risk strategy, while the leader would choose high-risk strategy when the effort\n\ncost is low. Gilpatric (2009) presents a model more closely related to ours, in the sense\n\nhe introduces a costly choice of risk, and propose a penalty that the last placed player\n\nmust bear, and thus it reduces the excessive risk taking by players in a tournament and\n\ncontrol the productive effort, but he does not explore the dynamic effect of risk taking.\n\nTournament in real life are usually dynamic, in the sense that players compete\n\nagainst each other in more than just one period, and usually at each period they learn\n\ntheir position before taking an action. Ederer (2010) and Aoyagi (2010) studied how the\n\n\n\n16\n\nmidterm information affects players\u2019 decision in the last period of a two-stage tournament,\n\nwhere the risk choice is not available for the players. Since the output is stochastic, in\n\nthe beginning of the second period one of the players will have an advantage, and if the\n\ninformation about the advantage is fully disclosed, then both players will have incentives\n\nto reduce effort. For the underdog, the marginal gain in the probability of winning is\n\nreduced and the cost to exert effort to tie the leader\u2019s advantage is high. However, if\n\nthe principal does not reveal the information about the advantage, players would be less\n\nheterogeneous, and thus they would exert more effort than in the full disclose information\n\ntournament.\n\nCabral (2003) and Anderson and Cabral (2007) are the first to study a dynamic\n\ntournament where players\u2019 decision involve choosing the variance of an output. They\n\nconsider an infinite time horizon, where players receive a payoff for each instant of time\n\ndepending on their position. The background for their model is the research and develop-\n\nment competition in an oligopolistic industry. Two players choose the volatility of their\n\nproduct quality at each instant, and receive a payoff according to the quality difference.\n\nSince the game has no end, players choice depends only on the previous quality difference\n\nand their patience. The linearity of their model results in a bang-bang solution, and their\n\nfindings are that for sufficiently patient player, the underdog (or laggard) chooses high\n\nrisk, while the leader will choose low-variance strategy.\n\nMany authors have empirically studied the problem of risk taking in tournaments.\n\nBrown et al. (1996) and Chevalier and Ellison (1997) study the mutual fund industry\n\nand associate the risk taking by the managers of investment portfolios to the relative\n\nperformance evaluation. Funds charge investors a percentage of their investment, called\n\nthe management fee, and thus mutual fund companies seeks increase the total amount of\n\nasset. Chevalier and Ellison (1997) first study the relationship between the inflow of new\n\ninvestment into a mutual fund and the funds historic performance. They estimate how\n\nthe market implicitly compensates funds for increasing the riskiness of their portfolios\n\ntoward the end of the year as a function of the funds\u2019 performance from January to\n\nSeptember year-to-date, age, and other characteristics. The expected inflow is shown to\n\nbe non-decreasing function of the previous excess return of the funds, and it presents a\n\nconvex shape when the returns exceed the market by 15 to 22 points. Therefore, this\n\npattern shows that very large returns bring higher flows as a fund starts to make annual\n\n\u201cbest fund\u201d lists, and gain more attention from potential investors. Secondly, they show\n\nthat funds that are somewhat behind the market have an incentive to gamble and try to\n\ncatch up, while funds that are somewhat ahead of the market have an incentive to lock\n\nin their gains. However, at the extreme points the incentive reverse. Finally, they show\n\nthat mutual funds alter their portfolios between September and December in a manner\n\nconsistent with the September incentives to take risk.\n\n\n\n17\n\nGenakos and Pagliero (2012) empirically study the impact of interim rank on risk\n\ntaking using data from weightlifting competitions. In this sport, players must announce\n\nthe weight they will attempt to lift at the beginning of each stage. The authors consider\n\nthe relative increase of the announcements as a measure of risk, that is, how much a player\n\nincreased his announcement from the previous one relative to the player placed first. In\n\norder to evaluate the players\u2019 behavior towards the risk, they estimate three different\n\nmodels: (i) Announcement vs Ranking; (ii) Announcement vs Absolute distance from\n\ncompetitors; and (iii) Announcement vs Intensity of the Competition. In the first model,\n\nthey found an inverted-U relationship between the announcement and interim ranking,\n\nthat is, the announcements increase from the first to sixth place but then decrease for\n\nfurther decreases in rank. One possible reason for riskier strategies for the third and fourth\n\nrank is the prize discontinuity between them, which provides incentives to take risk. In\n\nthe model (ii), they found the expected relationship between risk taking and distance from\n\ncompetitors. A player choose riskier strategy when the competitor in front is close and the\n\ntrailing player is far. On the other hand, a player reduces the risk when the competitor\n\nin front is far and the one trailing is close. Finally, in the model (iii), they measure the\n\nintensity of competition by the number of athletes that are close to each other, and they\n\nfound that more intense competitions stimulates more risk taking. However, Genakos and\n\nPagliero (2012) did not consider how risk taking by the competitors evolves along the\n\ntime, since their main concern was to evaluate how ranking affects the risk taking.\n\nAlthough it is a common wisdom players\u2019 behavior in a dynamic tournament, to the\n\nbest of our knowledge, no theoretical study has modeled how players seek more or less\n\nrisk as the game is near the end. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate players\u2019\n\nbehavior in the dynamic tournaments. At first, we will introduce the static model, in which\n\none player has an exogenous advantage at the beginning of the period, and evaluate how\n\nplayers seek risk. In Section 1.4 we present the dynamic model, where players start the\n\ntournament at the same position, and thus the advantage becomes endogenous. Next\n\nsection we describe the basic model in a static setting, where the advantage is exogenous.\n\nWe show the tournament incentives leads to inefficiency, and show how players behave in\n\nthe equilibrium.\n\n1.3 The Static Model\n\nIn this section, we study a tournament model in which one player may have an advantage\n\nrelative to his opponent, in terms of production level, and how it affects the risk taking\n\nby players.\n\n\n\n18\n\n1.3.1 Environment\n\nWe consider two players (? = ?,?) competing for a prize ? > 0, which is granted to\n\nthe player who produces the most, while the other player receives zero payoff. The tour-\n\nnament setting has the following timing: First, players learn their initial (dis)advantage,\n\nrepresented by ?1 as the initial advantage of player ?, and choose their action. The out-\n\nput is realized and the principal gives the prize to the player with highest output, after\n\nobserving it. The loser does not receive anything.\n\nFigure 1.1: Tournament Timing.\n\n0 1\nPrincipal chooses\n\n? > 0\n\nPlayers learn\n\n?1\n\nPlayer choose\n\ntheir action to\n\nproduce ? ?\n\nThe output ? ? is\n\nrealized.\n\nPrize ? given to\n\nthe player who\n\nproduces the most.\n\nThe production is a stochastic function of how players spend their time. There are\n\ntwo activities that players can engage in order to produce output, denoted by ? ? {?,?}.\nEach of them generates the same expected output per unit of time spent on it, given by\n\nthe strictly increasing and concave function ?(\u00b7), so it presents a diminishing marginal\noutput and the player could produce more by working in both activities. The activity ?\n\nis riskier than activity ?, in the sense that the task ? volatility per unit of time spent on\n\nit is higher than the volatility of task ?. Let ? be the amount of time spent on activity\n\n?, the output generated by this task follows a Normal distribution with mean ?(?) and\n\nvariance ??2?, i.e. ?\n?\n? ? ?(?(?),??\n\n2\n?), where ?\n\n2\n? > ?\n\n2\n? .\n\nEach player has ? units of time available to allocate in both of activities. Let ?? be the\n\namount of time player ? spends on the riskier activity, ?, thus ? ??? is the amount of time\nspent on the \u201csafe\u201d task, ?. After players learn ?1, they choose simultaneously how to spend\n\ntheir time by choosing ?? ? [0,?]. Observe that for each possible time allocation by player\n?, the output ? ? generated by a choice ?? follows a Normal distribution with mean ?(??? ) ?\n?(??) + ?(? ? ??) and variance ???2? + (? ? ??) ?2? . The outputs are independent, since\nthe random term is independent between players and tasks. Therefore, the total output\n\nproduce by player ? follows a Normal distribution, ? ? ? ? (?(??),???2? + (? ? ??) ?2? ))\n\nNote that the variance of the output is basically a convex combination between ?2?\n\nand ?2? , where the weights are the time allocated in each activity. The function ? is even\n\nwith respect to ?/2, i.e. ?(?) = ?(? ? ?), and thus we have the following two properties:\n(i) ??(?) = ? ?(?) ? ? ?(? ? ?) = ???(? ? ?), so the inclination of ? for two different points\n\n\n\n19\n\nequidistant to ?/2 has the same magnitude but with different sign, and; (ii) ?(\u00b7) is strictly\nincreasing in [0,?/2) and strictly decreasing in (?/2,?].\n\nWe can see that the maximum expected output is attained when ? ?(??) = ? ?(? ???),\nand since ?(\u00b7) is strictly increasing, the maximum is achieved when ?? = ?/2 = ? ? ??.\nThe Figure 1.2 shows us the function ?, which is equivalent to the set of possible choices\n\na player has.\n\nFigure 1.2: Set of Possible Choices\n\nSince the choice of how the time is allocated allocation is costless, in any payment\n\nscheme based on production, one would expected that the player would choose the alloca-\n\ntion that maximize the output, i.e., ?? = ?/2. However, in a tournament payment scheme,\n\nwhen a player is in disadvantage he might be willing to increase variance of his output in\n\norder to increase the chance of getting a higher output.\n\n1.3.2 Tournaments Incentives\n\nA tournament is a compensation scheme in which contestant\u2019s rewards are based on their\n\nordinal position alone and not on the actual size of their output. This scheme pays\n\n? > 0 to the player with highest output and zero to the second player. Players decide\n\nsimultaneously their action, seeking to increase their probability of winning the prize,\n\nwhich depends on player ? and ? choices and the distribution of the random variables\n\nthat affects both players output. If we introduce an advantage to player ?, denoted by\n\n?1, formally we have,\n\nmax\n??\n\n?P\n[?\n?1 + ?\n\n?(??) > ? ?(??)\n]?\n\n(1PP?)\n\nWe can use the properties that the sum of Normal distributions is a Normal distri-\n\n\n\n20\n\nbution, and rewrite the objective function, using the time constraint as\n\nP\n[?\n?1 + ?\n\n?(??) > ? ?(??)\n]?\n\n= ?\n\n(?\n?1 + ?(?\n\n?) ? ?(??)??\n(?? + ??) ?2? + (2? ? ?? ? ??)?2?\n\n)?\n,\n\nwhere ? is the standard Normal cumulative distribution function. In order to ease the\n\nnotation, denote\n\n?2 =\n(?\n?? + ??\n\n)?\n?2? + (2? ? ?\n\n? ? ??)?2?\n\nand\n\n? =\n?1 + ?(?\n\n?) ? ?(??)\n?\n\n.\n\nIn order to see the incentives behind a tournament scheme, we will study the first\n\norder condition of the player ?, which is the following\n\n0 =\n?\n\n?\n?(?)\n\n[?\n? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) ?\n\n?2? ? ?2?\n2?\n\n?\n\n]?\n?? ? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) =\n\n?2? ? ?2?\n2?\n\n?.\n\n(1.1)\n\nAs we can see in the above equation, it is not necessarily true that player maximize\n\nthe expected output, i.e. it\u2019s not always true that ? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) = 0. This would\nhappen if their contract was based on output production, but since they are working\n\nunder a relative performance evaluation (RPE) contract, a distortion can happen and\n\nthe best response for the player will not be to maximize expected output anymore. In a\n\ntournament, players want to maximize their probability of winning the prize by allocating\n\ntheir time in two activities. The leader would want to remain with the advantage to win\n\nthe game, so he is willing to sacrifice some of the expected output in order to reducing the\n\nrisk. By doing it, the noise effect over leader advantage is reduced. On the other hand,\n\nthe underdog would be willing to sacrifice some of the expected product he would get by\n\nmaximizing the output, in order to increase the volatility of his output. Thus, he would\n\nbe reducing the effect of the disadvantage.\n\nFigure 1.3 illustrates the general idea about incentives in tournaments, when a player\n\nhas an advantage towards the other. Suppose player ? starts with 1.5 units of output\n\nin the beginning of the game, while the other player has no output yet. In this simple\n\nexample, the figure shows the probability player ? wins when they both decide to produce\n\nat the same expected output, but with different levels of risk. In this example, player ?\n\nwould prefer to reduce his risk, by choosing the variance equals to ?2. On the other hand,\n\nthe underdog who is losing by 1.5, we can see his probability of winning on the left side of\n\nthe figure, where the vertical line intercepts ?1.5. In his case, he would be better choosing\n\n\n\n21\n\nhigher risk, so the initial disadvantage has lower influence over the outcome.\n\nFigure 1.3: Probability of Player ? win the Tournament\n\nIn the next subsection, we will provide different ways to read the first order condition\n\nfrom (1.1).\n\nReturn on Time Allocation\n\nWe can rewrite the Equation (1.1) in terms of marginal return of the time allocate to each\n\nactivity, and we can see the each player equates the marginal return of the risky and safe\n\nactivity, as shown by the following equation:\n\n? ?(??) ?\n?2?\n2?\n? = ? ?(? ? ??) ?\n\n?2?\n2?\n?. (1.2)\n\nThis equation shows on l.h.s. the marginal return of allocating an additional fraction of\n\nthe time on the risky activity, while the r.h.s. the same for safe activity. Note that since\n\n?2? > ?\n2\n? , the (dis)advantage affects more the risky choice. The Figure 1.4 illustrates this\n\nequation.\n\nFigure 1.4: Player ? first order condition\n\nNotes: To plot this figure, it was used ?? = 1\n2\n, ?2? = 1, ?\n\n2\n? = 2 and\n\n?(?) =\n?\n?.\n\n\n\n22\n\nNote that Figure 1.4 is based on the risky activity time allocation, i.e. ??. There-\n\nfore, this plot can be interpreted as the marginal benefit of the spending time at the risky\n\nactivity (red line) versus the marginal cost of opportunity to allocate time in this activity\n\n(blue line), which is given by the marginal benefit of spending time at the safe activity.\n\nFirst note that they are not symmetric, since ?2? > ?\n2\n? , hence one player will be willing to\n\ndeviate from the maximal expected output time allocation, whenever there is a disadvan-\n\ntage. If player ? starts with an advantage ?1 > 0, we will see that ? > 0, so working an\n\nadditional time on the risky task will negatively affect his probability of winning, because\n\n?2? > ?\n2\n? . We plotted two possible values for ?1, one positive (i.e. player ? has advantage)\n\nand one negative (i.e. player ? has advantage). We can see that when the player ? has an\n\nadvantage, the best response for him is to allocate more time in the safe activity ?? &lt;?/2,\n\nwhile when he is losing he prefers to work more on risky activities. We can also see that\n\nthe risky activity is more sensitive with variations on ?1, since ?\n2\n? > ?\n\n2\n? .\n\n1.3.3 Equilibrium\n\nIn the previous section, we analyzed the best response of a player, and it was shown\n\nthe effects of the advantage and the variance in this model. Now, we will characterize\n\nthe Nash equilibrium of this static tournament. From Equation (1.1) we have the best\n\nresponse of player ?. For player ?, the only change is that the probability of winning is\n\n1 ? ?(?), and thus, the system to be solved has the following equations:\n\n? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) =\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2?\n? and ? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) = ?\n\n?2? ? ?2?\n2?\n\n? (1.3)\n\nProposition 1 A pure-strategy equilibrium exists, if the following condition holds:\n\ninf\n??\n\n????\n???(??)\n\n??(??)\n\n????\n>\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2??2?\n. (1.4)\n\nThe players\u2019 equilibrium choice will satisfy the following equations:\n\n??(??) =\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2\n\n?1\n?(?2? + ?\n\n2\n? )\n\nand ??(??) = ?\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2\n\n?1\n?(?2? + ?\n\n2\n? )\n\n(1.5)\n\nProof. Note that ? is a strictly increasing function, so we are interested in maximizing\n\nit\u2019s argument, defined by\n\n? =\n?1 + ?(?\n\n?) ? ?(??)\n?\n\n\n\n23\n\nA sufficient condition for a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium to exist is that ? strictly\n\nconcave in player ? choice given any choice of his opponent. The existence is guarantee if\n\n???(??) ? ?????\n??(??)\n\n???\n&lt;0, for all ?? and ??,\n\nwhere ??? is the partial derivative of ? with respect to ?\n? and ????? is the second order\n\npartial derivative of ? with respect to ??. This condition holds if ??(??) = 0, since\n\n? is a concave function. If ??(??) &lt;0, this condition also holds, because ? is a strictly\n\nincreasing and concave function in ?. When ??(??) > 0, a sufficient condition to guarantee\n\nthe existence is\n\ninf\n??\n\n????\n???(??)\n\n??(??)\n\n????\n> sup\n\n??,??\n\n????\n?????\n\n???\n\n????\n.\n\nSince ?? ? [0,?], the right-hand side is equal to (?2???2? )/2??2? , thus we have the condition\n(1.4). The condition for player ? is the same, but ?? needs to be concave in ??. Assuming\nthat (1.4) holds, we can characterize the equilibrium by using the first order condition.\n\nWe can rewrite the Equation (1.3) using the function ?(\u00b7) and equalize them, so we\nfind ??(??) = ???(??). But using that ??(?) = ???(? ? ?), we rewrite the equilibrium\ncondition as ??(??) = ??(? ? ??), and since ? is strictly concave, we have ?? = ? ? ??, or\n?? + ?? = ?.1 We now rewrite ?2 = ?(?2? + ?\n\n2\n? ) and thus at the equilibrium we have\n\n? =\n?1??\n\n?(?2? + ?\n2\n? )\n,\n\nthus we have the equations (1.5).\n\nThis proposition shows how players behave depending on the initial advantage ?1.\n\nIf ?1 is positive, it means that player ? is ahead of player ?, and that ?\n?(??) > 0, that is,\n\nplayer ? will choose ?? &lt;?/2, so he is allocating more time on the safe activity, in order\n\nto reduce the volatility of his output. On the other hand, if ?1 is negative, so player ? is\n\nbehind player ?, we will have the opposite behavior, that is, he will seek risky activity in\n\norder to increase his output volatility, so he can increase the probability of winning the\n\ngame.\n\nThe idea is that whenever a player has some advantage, \u2018his probability of winning\n\nthe tournament is greater than 1/2. In order to maintain his advantage, he avoids allo-\n\ncating time to risky activity, since it would increase the variance of his output and thus\n\nreduce the probability of winning the tournament. On the other side, the player with dis-\n\nadvantage has the opposite incentive, since he could increase his probability of winning by\n\nincreasing the output variance. However, if no one has any advantage, then both players\n\n1Just a reminder, ? is strictly concave, thus ?? is strictly monotone.\n\n\n\n24\n\nwill maximize their expected output.\n\nFigure 1.5 shows the reaction function from both players and the equilibrium when\n\n?1 > 0, that is, player ? starts with an advantage. The figure is plotted in the following\n\nway: The blue line is the reaction function for player ?, the abscissa contains all possible\n\nchoices for player ?, and the line shows player ? best reaction. The red line is the\n\nreaction function for player ?, and the ordinate has all possible choices for player ?. The\n\nintersection of these two lines is the Nash equilibrium for this static tournament. The\n\nyellow dashed line represents the symmetric choices, that is ?? = ??.\n\nIn order to maintain his advantage, player ? will allocate more time to safe activities,\n\nreducing the volatility of his output. On the other hand, player ? seeks risky activities\n\nso that he reduces the probability of player ? wins the tournament, since he will be\n\nincreasing the variance of his output and of the output difference.\n\nFigure 1.5: Equilibrium with ?1 = 3\n\n(a) Reaction functions\n(b) Equilibrium choices on Mean-Variance\nFrontier\n\nEquation (1.5) shows the behavior of the players towards changes in the parameters\n\nof the model. Formally, we can use the implicit differentiation this equation to view the\n\neffect of changes in the parameters. First, note that function ? is strictly concave, so\n\nthe derivative of the inverse function of ?? is decreasing. Let us explore this properties\n\nbeginning with the advantage effects. As ?1 > 0 increases, the player ?, who has the\n\nadvantage, reduces his volatility by allocating more time on safe task, while player ?, the\n\nunderdog, seeks for more risk, as we have mentioned before. The Figure 1.6 show us the\n\nplayers\u2019 choice.\n\n\n\n25\n\nFigure 1.6: The Effect of ?1 over players\u2019 Strategy\n\nFormally, we have that\n\n???\n\n??1\n=\n\n?2? ? ?2?\n2?(?2? + ?\n\n2\n? )?\n\n??(??)\n&lt;0 and\n\n???\n\n??1\n= ?\n\n?2? ? ?2?\n2?(?2? + ?\n\n2\n? )?\n\n??(??)\n> 0. (1.6)\n\nThe magnitude of the change clearly depends on advantage, but also depends on\n\nthe time endowment, concavity of the expected output and variance parameters. When\n\nthe variance associated to the risky activity is relatively large to the safe risk, the player\n\nwho has an advantage will seek safer tasks even more, since he tries to reduce his output\n\nvolatility, while the underdog do the opposite. The ??? term represents how the marginal\n\nexpected output changes at each unit of time allocated on the risk activity. The more\n\nnegative is ???, means that a small change on the risk affects more severely the expected\n\noutput, so the player who has advantage will avoid reducing too much the risk compared\n\nto the optimal choice of ?/2, since it would have a large negative impact over his expected\n\noutput. Finally, the higher is the endowment of time, ?, since it also affects ??? in the\n\nopposite way, thus the overall effect is ambiguous.\n\nThe variance associated with the risky activity also affects players\u2019 choice, as ex-\n\npected. The higher is the variance of such activity, the less the leader will allocate time\n\non it, since it will reduce his probability of winning. The marginal effect will depend on\n\nthe advantage, endowment and on the second derivative of ?. Again, the higher is the\n\nadvantage, the more willing the leader will be to reduce the variance of his output, even\n\nthough losing in terms of expected output. The ??? term has the same intuition as in the\n\nprevious paragraph. The trade-off between allocating time to risk and safe activity now\n\nappears in this marginal effect:\n\n???\n\n??2?\n=\n\n?1\n???(??)\n\n?2?\n?(?2? + ?\n\n2\n? )\n\n2\n&lt;0 and\n\n???\n\n??2?\n= ?\n\n?1\n???(??)\n\n?2?\n?(?2? + ?\n\n2\n? )\n\n2\n> 0, (1.7)\n\n\n\n26\n\nso, as the variance of the safe activity increases, so the term\n?2?\n\n?(?2?+?\n2\n?)\n\n2 increases, then\n\nthe leader will not reduce the time allocation on risk activity too much compared to the\n\noptimal choice ?/2. This happens due to the lower trade-off between allocating time to\n\nthe risk and safe activity, measured by the difference ?2? ? ?2? .\n\nFinally, we can study how the endowment affects the equilibrium choices. Now,\n\nthe effect over the leader is clear, increasing the time allocated on risk activity, since the\n\noptimal level also increases. However, for the underdog, the effect is not clear. It will\n\ndepend on his disadvantage and on the ???.\n\n???\n\n??\n=\n? ??(? ? ??)\n???(??)\n\n?\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2?2(?2? + ?\n2\n? )\n\n?1\n???(??)\n\n> 0 and\n???\n\n??\n=\n? ??(? ? ??)\n???(??)\n\n+\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2?2(?2? + ?\n2\n? )\n\n?1\n???(??)\n\n.\n\n(1.8)\n\nTherefore, we can see that under a tournament scheme, the asymmetry between\n\nplayers and the possibility to take risk will reduce the total expected output. We can also\n\nsee that the larger is the advantage of one player, the other will seek more risk.\n\n1.3.4 Two Periods Tournament Model\n\nIn the previous section, we studied the equilibrium of a static tournament, when one of\n\nthe player can have an exogenous initial advantage. In this section, we will consider the\n\ntwo period model, in which all players start at the same level, that is, there will not be\n\nany player with an initial advantage, i.e. ?0 = 0. The objective of this section is to make\n\nthe advantage endogenous in the model, in the sense that the advantage at the second\n\nperiod is the realization of the stochastic output of each agent after each player chose\n\ntheir time allocation on both tasks.\n\nIn the tournament we study in this section, the principal grants the prize ? > 0 to\n\nthe player who produce the most, while the other player does not receive anything. This\n\nis a typical case of promotion, where ? can be seen as the increase of the salary for the\n\npromoted player. The output that the principal compares to reward the winner is now the\n\nsum of the each stage output. The first period, both players start with no initial output,\n\nand then choose how to allocate their time endowment ? of the period. The output\n\nis realized at the end of the first period, and players learn their (dis)advantage at the\n\nbeginning of the second period, so they can choose the risk of their output strategically,\n\njust as it was solved in the previous section.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, we will find the subgame perfect equilibrium by\n\nbackward induction. First, we solve the second stage problem for a given initial advantage\n\nat the second period, ?1. We starting solving the second stage, considering that player\n\nlearned ?1, that is, the (dis)advantage that player ? has towards player ?. This problem\n\n\n\n27\n\nwas solved in the Section 1.3.3, so now let us focus on the first stage problem. Player ?\n\nwill solve the following problem\n\nmax\n??1\n\n?P\n[?\n? ?1 (?\n\n?\n1 ) + ?\n\n?*\n\n2 > ?\n?\n1 (?\n\n?\n1 ) + ?\n\n?*\n\n2\n\n]?\n(2PP?)\n\nwhere ? ?\n*\n\n2 is the player ? output when he plays the equilibrium strategy for the second\n\nperiod. First, we use the equilibrium conditions to rewrite the output difference in the\n\nsecond stage:\n\n? ?\n*\n\n2 ? ?\n?*\n\n2 = ?(?\n?*\n\n2 ) ? ?(?\n?*\n\n2 ) + ??\n\n(???\n??\n\n*\n2 ?\n\n?\n2? ?\n\n??\n??\n\n*\n2 ?\n\n?\n2?\n\n)?\n+ ??\n\n(???\n? ? ??*2 ?\n\n?\n2? ?\n\n??\n? ? ??*2 ?\n\n?\n2?\n\n)?\n= ??\n\n(???\n??\n\n*\n2 ?\n\n?\n2? ?\n\n??\n??\n\n*\n2 ?\n\n?\n2?\n\n)?\n+ ??\n\n(???\n? ? ??*2 ?\n\n?\n2? ?\n\n??\n? ? ??*2 ?\n\n?\n2?\n\n)?\n,\n\nsince we know that ?(??\n*\n\n2 ) = ?(?\n?*\n2 ) by the symmetry of the model, thus the only impor-\n\ntant part to be considered is the realization of random variables. The difference for the\n\nfirst period is similar to the first line of the above equation:\n\n? ?1 ? ?\n?\n1 = ?(?\n\n?\n1 ) ? ?(?\n\n?\n1 ) + ??\n\n(???\n??1 ?\n\n?\n1? ?\n\n??\n??1 ?\n\n?\n1?\n\n)?\n+ ??\n\n(???\n? ? ??1 ?\n\n?\n1? ?\n\n??\n? ? ??1 ?\n\n?\n1?\n\n)?\n,\n\nusing the equations above and that ??\n*\n\n2 + ?\n?*\n2 = ? from the equilibrium condition shown\n\nin the proof of the Proposition 1, we can rewrite the probability in the following way\n\nP\n[?\n? ?1 (?\n\n?\n1 ) + ?\n\n?*\n\n2 > ?\n?\n1 (?\n\n?\n1 ) + ?\n\n?*\n\n2\n\n]?\n= ?\n\n(?\n?(??1 ) ? ?(??1 )??\n\n?2? (? + ?\n?\n1 + ?\n\n?\n1 ) + ?\n\n2\n? (3? ? ??1 ? ? ? ??1 )\n\n)?\n.\n\nNow, let us define ?1 and ?\n2\n1:\n\n?21 = ?\n2\n?\n\n(?\n? + ??1 + ?\n\n?\n1\n\n)?\n+ ?2?\n\n(?\n3? ? ??1 ? ?\n\n?\n1\n\n)?\nand\n\n?1 =\n?(??1 ) ? ?(??1 )\n\n?1\n\nClearly, substituting these equation in the player ?\u2019s problem, it is easy to see that\n\nit is similar to the static problem, when ?0 = 0. So, using the proposition 1 we know that\n\nplayers will maximize their output, by allocating their time equally on both activities,\n\ni.e., each player will spend ??1? =\n?/2 units of time on each task. Therefore, we can see that\n\nthe (dis)advantage creates incentives for players deviate from the optimal time allocation,\n\nand since part of relative position is due to random variables, players will almost surely\n\nbe deviating from the allocation that maximizes the expected output.\n\n\n\n28\n\n1.4 The Dynamic Model\n\nA natural extension to the previous section is when the tournament has ? periods. Now,\n\nwe will consider a dynamic tournament, in which both players start with the same output\n\nlevel as before. However, as the tournament develops, a player finds out he is ahead of\n\nthe other and take strategical actions to increases his chances of winning the tournament\n\nat each period. The setting is quite similar as the previous one, but now players will be\n\nevaluated after ? periods, and at the end of each period players will learn their position.\n\nHere, the principal compares the sum of the output over the ? periods, and the prize will\n\nbe given to the player with the highest output level at the end of period ?.\n\nWe consider a ??period dynamic stochastic game with two players (? = ?,?),\nwhere each of them chooses how to spend their time at each period in order to produce\n\nthe output ? ?? . The sum of the output over time will be considered by the principal to\n\ndetermine the winner, who will be granted a prize ? > 0, while the loser gets nothing.\n\nLet ??? = ?\n?\n? ? ? ?? be the output difference with respect to player ? at period ?, then\n\nthe principal will grant the prize to player ? if ?? ?\n???\n\n?=0 ??? > 0, otherwise player ?\n\nwill receive the prize. Formally, the last period payoff is a function ??? : ? ?? R, where\n? ? R is the state space of the game and\n\n??? (?? ) =\n\n?????\n????\n? , if ?? > 0;\n\n?/2 , if ?? = 0;\n\n0 , otherwise,\n\nand ??? (?? ) =\n\n?????\n????\n? , if ?? &lt;0;\n\n?/2 , if ?? = 0;\n\n0 , otherwise,\n\n(1.9)\n\nor, as it will be more convenient for computation later, ??? (?? ) = ?1{?? >0}, where 1{?? >0}\n\nis the indicator function that equals 1 when ?? > 0. The utility for player ? is similar,\n\nexcept that the prize is given when ?? &lt;0. The tournament studied here does not\n\nconsider a midterm reward, so the utility function per period ? &lt;? equals zero.\n\nPlayers make their choice after learning the accumulated output difference ?? ????\n?=0 ??? from the end of previous period, that is, the accumulated output difference up\n\nto the beginning of period ?. We assume that at the initial period both players begin the\n\ntournament with no output, thus ?0 = 0. We can rewrite the law of motion as\n\n??+1 = ?? + ?\n?\n? ? ?\n\n?\n? , (1.10)\n\nwhere the state of the next period ??+1 depends on the current initial state ?? and the\n\nplayers output ? ?? realization at the end of the period, after players made their decision.\n\nAt each period, players can engage in two activities, denoted by ? ? {?,?}, to produce\nthe output ? ?? , which is a stochastic function of the time spent performing each task. As\n\n\n\n29\n\nin the model from Section 1.3, for each unit of time ? spent on an activity, the expected\n\noutput will be ?(?), where ?(\u00b7) is a strictly increasing and concave function, thus having\nthe same property as before, diminishing marginal productivity. Also, by working in a\n\ntask ?, the player will be subject to output volatility associated with that task, which is\n\ngiven by ?2??, where ?\n2\n? > ?\n\n2\n? . Therefore, given that the player chooses to spend ? units\n\nof time on activity ?, the output generated by it follows a Normal distribution with mean\n\n?(?) and variance ??2?, that is, ?\n?\n?? ? ?(?(?),??\n\n2\n?).\n\nBoth players have ? units of time available to work in both of tasks. Denote ??? ?\n[0,?] ? ?? be the amount of time player ? spend on the riskier activity, ?, thus ? ???? is the\namount of time spent on the \u201csafe\u201d task, ?. Due to the diminishing marginal productivity,\n\nplayers will probably work on both activities, and thus the player ? production ? ?? at the\n\nperiod ? follows a Normal distribution with mean ?(??? ) ? ?(??? ) + ?(? ? ??? ) and variance\n????\n\n2\n? + (? ? ??? ) ?2? , i.e. ? ?? ? ?(?(??? ),????2? + (? ? ??? ) ?2? ), since it is the sum of independent\n\nNormal distributions. Again, we assume the players\u2019 output is independently distributed,\n\nhence we can find the transition probability ? : ? \u00d7 ? ?? ?(?), that is the probability\ndensity of next period be the state ?? given the current players\u2019 choice and state ?, i.e.\n\n?(??; ??,??,?), where ?(?) is the set of probability distributions on the set ?. The\ntransition function can be found by using the properties from Normal distributions, hence\n\nwe have\n\n??+1 ? ?\n(?\n?? + ?(?\n\n?\n? ) ? ?(?\n\n?\n? ),?\n\n2\n?\n\n(?\n??? + ?\n\n?\n? ) + ?\n\n2\n?\n\n(?\n2? ? ??? ? ?\n\n?\n?\n\n)?)?\n, (1.11)\n\ntherefore, ? is the probability density function (pdf) of a Normal distribution given by\n\n(1.11) and we denote ? as its cumulative density function (cdf).\n\nFormally, the game is a tuple [?,(??,??? )?=?,?,?]\n?\n\n?=0\n, where ? = R for all ? is the\n\nstate space, ?? = [0,?] for ? = ?,? is the action space, that is, the players\u2019 endowment of\n\ntime and ? : ? \u00d7 ?? \u00d7 ?? ? [0,1] is the cumulative distribution of the state transition\nfunction from ?? to ??+1 given a choice (?\n\n?,??).\n\nTherefore, the game proceeds as follows. At period ? = 0, both players learn that\n\nthey are starting the game with no initial output, that is, the initial state is ?0 = 0. After\n\nobserving the initial state, players choose how to spend their time endowment of ? over\n\nthe two tasks, ?0 =\n(?\n??0 ,?\n\n?\n0\n\n)?\n, simultaneously and independently from each other. After the\n\nrealization of both outputs, the state ?0 transits to state ?1 according to the distribution\n\nmentioned above, that follows the Normal distribution ?(?0 + ?(?\n?\n0 ) ? ?(??0 ),?2? (??0 +\n\n??0 ) + ?\n2\n? (2? ? ??0 ? ??0 )). In the next round, at period ? = 1, after observing the state ?1,\n\nplayers choose how to allocate their time ?1, and after the realization of the outputs, the\n\nstate changes again. The game goes on this way for ? ? 1 periods. At the beginning of\nperiod ?, when the outputs are realized, the principal learns who produced the most by\n\n\n\n30\n\nobserving ?? , and grant the prize ? to player ? if ?? > 0, otherwise player ? wins the\n\nprize ?.\n\nThe nature of the tournament, that is the compensation scheme depending only\n\non the ?? , makes different histories of the game lead to a same states, which is the\n\nvariable observed by the players. This property allow us to focus our attention to Markov\n\nstrategies. Let ??? : ? ? ?? denote the Markov strategy for period ?, and ??\n? ? {???}\n\n?\n\n?=0\nthe\n\nstrategy up to period ?. The complete strategy for the tournament for player ? is denoted\n\nby ?? ? ??? . Now, we can write the expected payoff function based on the strategy profile\n? ?\n\n(?\n??,??\n\n)?\n, given by\n\n?(?) ? E?\n[?\n??? (?? )\n\n]?\n, (1.12)\n\nwhere E? is the expectation taken with respect to the measure induced by transition\nprobability ?(\u00b7) and the strategy profile ?. The equilibrium concept we use to solve the\ngame is the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), which considers that players condition\n\ntheir actions only on the current state of the game ??. A strategy profile is a Markov\n\nperfect equilibrium, if the strategy profile is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium and\n\nthe strategies is Markovian. Since we consider a finite horizon game, using the one-shot\n\ndeviation principle, we can find the equilibrium by backward induction, so we have the\n\nfollowing definition.\n\nDefinition 1 A (nonstationary) Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) in this setting is a\n\npair of a finite sequence of value function {? ?? ,? ?? }??=0 and a Markov strategy profile ?\nsuch that\n\n? The system of Bellman equation\n\n? ???1(???1) ? max\n??\n? ?1\n\n??\n??? (?? )?(?? |???1,?\n\n?\n??1,?\n\n??\n??1)??? (1.13)\n\n? ?? (??) ? max\n???\n\n??\n? ??+1(??+1)?(??+1|??,?\n\n?\n? ,?\n\n??\n? )???+1 (1.14)\n\nis satisfied for ? = ?,?, with the expectation induced by the probability distribution\n\n?.\n\n? The strategy of players are optimal each period ?:\n\n????1 ? arg max\n??\n? ?1\n\n??\n??? (?? )?(?? |???1,?\n\n?\n??1,?\n\n??\n??1)???\n\n??? ? arg max\n???\n\n??\n? ?? (??+1)?(??+1|??,?\n\n?\n? ,?\n\n??\n? )???+1\n\nIn other words, to carry out backward induction, we start at the last period of\n\n\n\n31\n\nplayers\u2019 action, ? ? 1, and for each possible state ???1 we calculate the time ? ? 1 value\nfunctions and strategies. Next, we move backward one period to time ? ? 2, the expected\nvalue function considers that players will behave according to the strategy found at the\n\nperiod ? ? 1 in the future, and solve the players\u2019 problem considering the probability\ninduced by the next period strategies and the decision at the period ? ? 2. We continue\nthe backward induction recursively for the periods ? ? 3,? ? 4,... until we reach time\nperiod ? = 0, and thus we have the equilibrium strategy profile ?.\n\nProposition 2 There is a unique interior Markov perfect equilibrium, in which the strat-\n\negy profile ? is such that ??? satisfies at each period ? the following equation\n\n??(??? ) =\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2\n\n??\n(? ? ?) ?(?2? + ?2? )\n\nand ??(??? ) = ??\n?(??? ), (1.15)\n\nand the value function for each period ? is given by\n\n? ?? (??) = ??\n\n(?\n??\n\n(? ? ?) ?(?2? + ?2? )\n\n)?\nand ? ?? (??) = ?\n\n[?\n1 ? ?\n\n(?\n??\n\n(? ? ?) ?(?2? + ?2? )\n\n)?]?\n,\n\n(1.16)\n\nif the following condition holds:\n\ninf\n??\n\n????\n???(??)\n\n??(??)\n\n????\n>\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2??2?\n. (1.17)\n\nProof. At the last period of players\u2019 decision, ? ? 1, the problem is similar to the\none presented in Section 1.3.1. Players learn ???1 and must choose how to spend their\n\ntime in order to maximize their probability of winning the tournament, which depends\n\non the law of motion and the transition distribution. Using the law of motion given by\n\n?? = ???1 + ?\n?\n??1 ? ?\n\n?\n??1, and the Normal distribution of the outputs, the distribution\n\nof ?? will be a Normal distribution with mean ???1 + ?(?\n?\n??1) ? ?(?\n\n?\n??1) and variance\n\n?2??1 = ?\n2\n?\n\n(?\n????1 + ?\n\n?\n??1\n)?\n\n+ ?2?\n(?\n2? ? ????1 ? ?\n\n?\n??1\n)?\n. The objective function from Equation\n\n(1.13) for player ? can be rewritten as\n\n??\n??? (?? )?(?? |???1,?\n\n?\n??1,?\n\n?\n??1)??? =\n\n??\n?1{?? >0}\n\n1\n\n???1\n?\n\n(?\n?? ? ???1 ? ?(????1) + ?(?\n\n?\n??1)\n\n???1\n\n)?\n???\n\n= ?\n\n?? +?\n0\n\n1\n\n???1\n?\n\n(?\n?? ? ???1 ? ?(????1) + ?(?\n\n?\n??1)\n\n???1\n\n)?\n???\n\n= ??\n\n(?\n???1 + ?(?\n\n?\n??1) ? ?(?\n\n?\n??1)\n\n???1\n\n)?\n,\n\nsince the integrand is the density of a standardize normal distribution in the second line\n\nand we used the property from Normal distribution that 1 ? ?(?) = ?(??). Now it is\nclear that both problem from period ? and the static one presented in Section 1.3.1 is\n\n\n\n32\n\nthe same. Therefore, the Proposition 1 solves the problem to find the strategy profile for\n\nperiod ? ? 1:\n\n??(????1) =\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2\n\n???1\n?(?2? + ?\n\n2\n? )\n\nand ??(????1) = ??\n?(????1). (1.18)\n\nDue to symmetry of the production function of the activities, ? and ?, ??(????1) = ??\n?(????1)\n\nimplies that both players will choose an allocation that generates the same expected\n\noutput, ?(????1) = ?(?\n?\n??1), but different levels of risk such that ?\n\n?\n??1 + ?\n\n?\n??1 = ?, so\n\n?2??1 = ?(?\n2\n? + ?\n\n2\n? ). Using this information, we now can find a closed-form solution for the\n\nlast period expected value function,\n\n? ???1(???1) = ??\n\n(?\n???1\n\n?(?2? + ?\n2\n? )\n\n)?\nand ? ???1(???1) = ?\n\n[?\n1 ? ?\n\n(?\n???1\n\n?(?2? + ?\n2\n? )\n\n)?]?\n.\n\nWe use the guess-and-verify method to find the value function for the period ?. In\n\norder to find an educated guess, we can compute the probability of winning by each player,\n\nwhen they play the same strategy of the period ? ? 1, but taking into account that there\nwill be ? ? ? random variables realizing until the end of the game. So, let the following\nfunction be our guess for the player ?\u2019s value function for period ?,\n\n? ?? (??) = ??\n\n(?\n????\n\n(?2? + ?\n2\n? ) ?(? ? ?)\n\n)?\nand ? ?? (??) = ?\n\n[?\n1 ? ?\n\n(?\n????\n\n(?2? + ?\n2\n? ) ?(? ? ?)\n\n)?]?\n.\n\n(1.19)\n\nWe will solve the problem for player ?, since the player ? problem can be done by\n\nthe same way. In order to verify the guess for the value function, we move forward in the\n\ntime, so we have ? ??+1(??+1) and substituting it in the Equation (1.14), we can solve player\n\n?\u2019s problem. First, let ?*\n2\n\n? = (?\n2\n? + ?\n\n2\n? ) ?(? ? ? ? 1), we can rewrite the integral using our\n\nguess as??\n?\n\n(?\n??+1\n?*?+1\n\n)?\n1\n\n??\n?\n\n(?\n??+1 ? ?? ? ?(??? ) + ?(??? )\n\n??\n\n)?\n???+1 =\n\n??\n??1 (?1)??2 (?1 ? ?)??1,\n\nwhere ??1 is a cdf of a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance ?\n*2\n? , the function ??2\n\nis a pdf of a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance ?2? , and ? = ?? +?(?\n?\n? )??(??? ).\n\nIntegrating by parts, we can rewrite it as\n\n?(?) =\n\n??\n??1 (?1) [1 ? ??2 (?1 ? ?)] ??1.\n\nDifferentiating it with respect to ??, we find ?\n?(?) =\n\n??\n??1 (?1)??2 (?1 ? ?)??1, a con-\n\nvolution of two normal density function. Therefore, we know that ??(?) will be a pdf of\n\n\n\n33\n\na Normal distribution with mean zero and variance given by the sum of both variances,\n\nand hence\n\n?\n(?\n?? + ?(?\n\n?\n? ) ? ?(?\n\n?\n? )\n)?\n\n= ?\n\n(?\n?? + ?(?\n\n?\n? ) ? ?(??? )??\n\n?2? [?\n?\n? + ?\n\n?\n? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)] + ?2? [2? ? ??? ? ??? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)]\n\n)?\n.\n\nNow we can compute the Nash equilibrium for the period ? using our guess, where\n\nplayers solve the following problems\n\nmax\n???\n\n??\n\n(?\n?? + ?(?\n\n?\n? ) ? ?(??? )??\n\n?2? [?\n?\n? + ?\n\n?\n? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)] + ?2? [2? ? ??? ? ??? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)]\n\n)?\n\nmax\n???\n\n?\n\n[?\n1 ? ?\n\n(?\n?? + ?(?\n\n?\n? ) ? ?(??? )??\n\n?2? [?\n?\n? + ?\n\n?\n? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)] + ?2? [2? ? ??? ? ??? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)]\n\n)?]?\n.\n\nThe solution of these problem can be found by the same way we use in the Propo-\n\nsition 1, and thus must satisfies the following conditions\n\n??(??? ) =\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2\n\n??\n(? ? ?) ?(?2? + ?2? )\n\nand ??(??? ) = ??\n?(??? ), (1.20)\n\nwhere again we have ?(??? ) = ?(?\n?\n? ) and ?\n\n?\n? + ?\n\n?\n? = ?. Finally, using these conditions, we\n\ncan check that our guess (1.19) for the value function is indeed the correct value function:\n\n? ?? (??) = ??\n\n(?\n????\n\n(?2? + ?\n2\n? ) ?(? ? ?)\n\n)?\nand ? ?? (??) = ?\n\n[?\n1 ? ?\n\n(?\n????\n\n(?2? + ?\n2\n? ) ?(? ? ?)\n\n)?]?\n.\n\nThus, by the procedure of guess-and-verify, we found the value function and the strategy\n\nprofile for period ?. The sufficient condition for uniqueness can be found by the same way\n\nas in Proposition 1, which concludes the demonstration.\n\nThe strategy profile for period ? is similar to the static equilibrium, except that now\n\nit depends on the accumulated output difference up to period ?, and there is a new term,\n\n? ? ? , which is how many periods have left until the end of the game. This term allow\nus to formalize the idea about how player behave over a multi-stage tournament.\n\nThis idea is formalized in the following corollary.\n\nCorollary 2 Players with (dis)advantage will seek (more) less risk as the game comes to\n\nthe end.\n\nProof. Suppose player ? has some advantage, i.e. ?? > 0. By the implicit differentiation,\n\nwe have\n????\n\n?(? ? ? + 1)\n= ?\n\n?2? ? ?2?\n2?2(? ? ?)2(?2? + ?2? )\n\n??\n???(??? )\n\n> 0,\n\n\n\n34\n\nand\n????\n\n?(? ? ?)\n=\n\n?2? ? ?2?\n2?2(? ? ?)2(?2? + ?2? )\n\n??\n???(??? )\n\n&lt;0,\n\nwhere the inequality signs come from the fact that ?(\u00b7) is a strictly concave function.\n\nThis corollary shows us how the player behave along the tournament. In words,\n\ngiven an advantage for player ?, if the tournament is just beginning and it will endure\n\nfor a long time, the term on denominator ? ? ? will be higher, reducing the value of\n??. The intuition is that, if the tournament will continue for a long time, there will be\n\nhigher \u201cuncertainty \u201d about the outcome at the end of the tournament, and thus trying to\n\nreduce the variance of the period ? outcome won\u2019t have much impact at the final outcome.\n\nTherefore, players prefer to maximize their output on the early stages of the game. As\n\nthe game come to the end, the player with advantage will try to secure his position by\n\nreducing the time allocate on the risky activity, as now it will have greater impact on the\n\nfinal output. On the other hand, the underdog will seek risk.\n\nIn order to provide an examples and see how player behave over time in a dynamic\n\ntournament, we made a simulation of a twenty-period tournament which is shown in\n\nFigure 1.7. There are five different realizations of the random variables involved in the\n\ntournament, each represented by different color. Each color is a new tournament starting\n\nfrom zero. We show three different figures, where the first is the accumulated output\n\ndifference, that is, ??, which is the state of the game at the beginning of period ?. When\n\nthe lines are above zero, it means player ? is ahead, and player ? is losing. For example,\n\nreading figure 1.7a, the blue line represents a tournament realization. Both players starts\n\nat 0, so there is no advantage at the first period. By the period 5, player ? has 4 units of\n\noutput more than player ?. At the end of the tournament, represented by period ? = 21,\n\nwe can see who was the winner. The dark blue tournament, player ? won approximately\n\nby 6.8 output units more than player ?. The light blue line, player ? won the tournament\n\nby 10 units more than player ?.\n\nIn the Figure 1.7b is depicted how player allocate their time on risk activity. As\n\nit was shown by proposition 1, since players start without any advantage, both players\n\nchose ?/2, and thus maximize their expected output. As the tournament evolves, some\n\nplayer will obtain some advantage, and they start to deviate from the optimal choice, ?/2.\n\nWe can see the proposition 1 working here. Take the dark blue line for example. From\n\nthe Figure 1.7a, we know that player ? is always ahead of player ?, so he reduces the\n\nvolatility of his output by allocating more time to safe activities, i.e. ???&lt;\n?/2.\n\nThe Figure 1.7c represents the expected output for player ?. We can see that he\n\navoids to deviate from the optimal choice ?/2 during most part of the tournament, which\n\ngenerates an expected output of 1.4142 in this setting.\n\n\n\n35\n\nWe can also see the proposition 2 working here, using this three figures. Consider the\n\ntournament represented by the light blue line. We can see player ? with a disadvantage\n\nequal to 10 in 5 different moments (? ? 7,8,15,18,20). In Figure 1.7b we can see player\n? time allocation on risky activity. By looking at the periods mentioned above, we can\n\nsee that as the tournament nears the end, he seeks more risk, although he has the same\n\ndisadvantage at those moments. By the end of the game, he allocates more than 90% of\n\nhis time on the risky activity. Figure 1.7c shows that players avoid distortions on expected\n\noutput during most part of the tournament.\n\nFigure 1.7: Tournament with 20 periods\n\n(a) Player ? Advantage\n\n(b) Player ? Time Allocation on Risky\nActivity\n\n(c) Player ? Expected Output\n\n1.5 Other Extensions for the Static Tournament\n\nIn this section we discuss some possible modifications and extensions on the static version\n\nof the model presented in Section 1.3.1, and see how it affects players behavior.\n\n\n\n36\n\n1.5.1 Asymmetric expected output\n\nWe shall discuss the implications of the symmetry of the expected output function ?(\u00b7) and\nwhat would happen if we relax this assumption. The symmetry of the expected output\n\nfunction helped us to find a closed-form solution for both the static and, especially, the\n\ndynamic tournament. The symmetry implies that the function ? is even with respect to\n\n?/2, i.e. ?(?) = ?(? ? ?), and so the inclination of ? for two different points equidistant\nto ?/2 has the same magnitude but with different sign, i.e. ??(?) = ??(? ? ?). Therefore,\nthe equilibrium condition that ??(??) = ???(??) implies that ?(??) = ?(??). Another\nimplication that follows from the function ? is even with respect to ?/2 is that we can\n\nwrite ??(?) = ???(? ? ?), and using the assumption that ? is a concave function, then ??\n\nwill be monotone, and so the equilibrium condition implies that ?? = ? ? ??. By doing\nit, we were able to find a closed form for the variance ?2 and solve the players\u2019 problem.\n\nWe can relax this assumption by considering that each activity has a different ex-\n\npected output, say ??(\u00b7) and ??(\u00b7). Now, for each ?? unit time spent on task ? by player\n?, the output generated by it follows a Normal distribution, i.e. ? ?? ? ?(??(??),???\n\n2\n?).\n\nDenote now the expected total output by player ? as ?(???) = ??(?\n?\n?) + ??(? ? ???).\n\nThe first order condition would be similar to the Equation (1.3), but now considering\n\ntwo different function for the expected output,\n\n? ??(?\n?) ? ? ??(? ? ?\n\n?) =\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2?\n? and ? ??(?\n\n?) ? ? ??(? ? ?\n?) = ?\n\n?2? ? ?2?\n2?\n\n?, (1.21)\n\nand again the condition for the equilibrium is\n\n??(??) =\n?2? ? ?2?\n\n2?\n? = ???(??).\n\nHowever, since the expected output functions are not symmetric, we cannot find a closed-\n\nform solution to the problem as before, and thus we would not be able to use the guess-\n\nand-verify method to find the equilibrium in the dynamic model. The Figure 1.8 below\n\nillustrates a situation in which ? ??/?\n?\n? is an increasing function of ?, that is, the marginal\n\nrate of technical substitution is increasing. So, in order to maintain the same level of\n\nexpected output, reducing one unit of time allocated to risky activity, a player needs\n\nto increase in less than one unit of time allocated to the safe activity. We illustrate\n\nnumerically the case where ?1 > 0, that is, player ? has an advantage. In this situation,\n\nit becomes harder to determine analytically the signal of ?, that is, if ?1 + ?(?\n?) ? ?(??)\n\nis positive or negative.\n\n\n\n37\n\nFigure 1.8: Set of possible choices of the asymmetric model\n\n1.5.2 Tie-Break Rule\n\nNow, we consider the static model presented in section 1.3.1 again, but we will introduce\n\na tie-break rule, in the sense that, if the output of a player are not sufficiently greater than\n\nhis opponent\u2019 output, the principal will declare a tie. The motivation of this section is to\n\nprovide further insights about tournaments when the precision of the measure to decide\n\nwho will be the winner is not good enough. For example, in the swimming competition\n\nand car racing, it is possible to determine the winner no matter how close they are, using\n\nprecision timing of milliseconds. However, in the fund industry, a small difference over\n\nperformance may not be enough for a fund receive more deposits than the other one.\n\nMaybe the investor prefer to move their money to other funds only if they are sufficiently\n\nbetter than the one where the money is deposited due to transaction costs.\n\nIn order to do that, let us introduce the tie-break as ? > 0 and now we will need\n\nthree prizes. To ease the computation, we will consider a symmetric prizes: ?,0 and ??,\nthat is, the winner receives ? , if there is a tie both players receive nothing, and the loser\n\nmust pay ?. So, for example, player ? wins the tournament, if his output overcomes\n\nplayer ? output plus ?, i.e. ? ? > ? ? + ?. This setting could be thought as the case of\n\ninvestment funds inflow. The winner fund is the one with sufficiently higher performance\n\nand will receive an inflow of ? deposit, while the loser will notice an outflow of ? from\n\ntheir deposits.

The vertical axis, on the right side is how player ? spends\n\nhis time on the risky activity, and is represented by the red line. On the other side, it\n\nshows the expected output generated by this player, and it is plotted as a blue line. The\n\nhorizontal axis contains all tie-break rules considered for this example, that goes from\n\nzero up to 10.\n\nFigure 1.9: Player ?

We can see that the tie-break\n\n\n\n40\n\nrule also induce the maximal expected output when it is equal to 2. In this case, and for\n\nvalues larger than it, this player start acting as the leader, and reduces its risk.\n\n1.6 Conclusion\n\nTournaments are a pervasive circumstance, as they serve as an important tool for providing\n\nincentives. Most work on tournament theory has used the labor economics predominantly\n\nas its background. However, it is quite general, since we can apply it for investment funds,\n\nresearch and development, elections and political campaigns, students\u2019 competition for\n\nbetter recommendation letter and so on.\n\nThe initial literature showed that tournaments can be a good instrument for encour-\n\naging the optimal effort level under a situation where players are subject to a common\n\nrisk, affecting the output of all contestants. However, in a dynamic setting, players can\n\ndeviate from what is the best choice from the principal point of view in order to increase\n\ntheir chance of winning the prize, due to the asymmetric position they will almost surely\n\nbe. It also can induce risk-seeking behavior by the player in disadvantage, since overcom-\n\ning his opponent becomes harder through the effort, and volatility will be more likely the\n\nway to increase his chance of winning the prize.\n\nThis paper has studied how players behave in a tournament towards the risk taking\n\nin a static and dynamic setting. Our environment considered different tasks that a player\n\ncan work on, and each of them is associated with different risk levels. The standard\n\nmodel in the tournament literature involves no trade-off between the expected output\n\nand variance, and the choice of risk does not involve any cost. However, in order to take\n\nmore risk, sometimes agents need to give up some expected return. The trade-off between\n\nexpected output and variance allowed us to find an interior solution for the problem, while\n\nin most of the literature that do not consider a direct cost over the variance choice end up\n\nwith extreme variance choices. In order to deal with it, most of the studies allow players\n\nto choose between two possible values, that is high risk and low risk. The problem is\n\nthat in a dynamic setting, the equilibrium in the two-stage model increases the difficult\n\nof find a unique solution for the game. In our setting, the simultaneous choice of risk\n\nand expected return allow us to consider the dynamic problem in a more tractable way.\n\nWe were able to find the Markov perfect equilibrium for the dynamic tournament, and\n\nthus formalizing the common wisdom that contestant seeks more risk by the end of the\n\ntournament.\n\nNonetheless, many questions kept unanswered, and should be a matter of concern for\n\nthe development of this research. We assumed that activities have a symmetric expected\n\noutput, since it can easily characterize the equilibrium. However, we might lose some\n\n\n\n41\n\ninteresting properties from the equilibrium by doing this assumption. It could be possible\n\nto understand better, how player perceive the trade-off between the mean and variance, by\n\nrelaxing the symmetry assumption. In addition, a growing part of literature are concerned\n\nabout the optimal design of the prizes and the property of convexity of it, so it could be a\n\nfuture extension for this model to compute the optimal prize. Another extension could be\n\nto study what happen when more players are in the game. Finally, it would be interesting\n\nto test empirically the risk behavior the players have along a tournament.\n\n\n\n42\n\nBibliography\n\nAnderson, A. and Cabral, L. M. B.

A incerteza geolo?gica e? represen-\n\ntada por um componente estoca?stico no custo marginal. Caracterizamos o contrato\n\no?timo e, a partir da esta?tica comparativa, avaliamos a eficie?ncia e a viabilidade da\n\ncooperac?a?o. O prec?o e o grau da externalidade afetam positivamente o n??vel de\n\neficie?ncia do contrato o?timo. Mas enquanto prec?os elevados viabilizam os acordos,\n\no grau de externalidade elevado pode conduzir a equil??brios ineficientes ou mesmo\n\ninviabilizar a produc?a?o. O mesmo resultado ocorre com os custos fixos. Adicional-\n\nmente, quanto maior for o nu?mero de firmas envolvidas no acordo, menor sera? a\n\nchance de existir um contrato mais eficiente que a regra da captura.\n\n2.1 Introduc?a?o\n\nUm setor de petro?leo descentralizado cria condic?a?o para um problema potencial inerente\n\naos recursos de propriedade comum, a trage?dia dos comuns. Este problema surge quando\n\nduas ou mais firmas te?m direito de explorac?a?o um mesmo reservato?rio. Devido a? natureza\n\nmigrato?ria, a extrac?a?o de uma firma ira? afetar a produc?a?o e o custo das outras firmas.\n\nCaso na?o haja algum tipo de esforc?o para cooperac?a?o, o resultado sera? a explorac?a?o em\n\nn??veis elevados. O custo da extrac?a?o sera? demasiadamente elevado e o retorno da produc?a?o\n\ndo reservato?rio reduzira?. Logo o resultado da competic?a?o sera? a ineficie?ncia.\n\nPara evitar a perda associada a? extrac?a?o competitiva, as firmas podem tentar coop-\n\n\n\n44\n\nerar, definindo consensualmente um plano de produc?a?o o?timo. A unitizac?a?o e? um acordo\n\nde cooperac?a?o para a extrac?a?o conjunta, de forma mais racional do reservato?rio. Pore?m,\n\na incerteza geolo?gica dificulta a negociac?a?o destes acordos, pois ela induz a? assimetria\n\nde informac?a?o entre as firmas. Alguns trabalhos emp??ricos, como Libecap and Wiggins\n\n(1985), reportam que nem sempre estes acordos sa?o conclu??dos com sucesso. Diante deste\n\nproblema, a questa?o que surge naturalmente e?: como o ambiente influencia a viabilidade\n\nde contratos que possam reduzir a ineficie?ncia da competic?a?o sob a regra da captura.\n\nNeste trabalho foi abordada a cooperac?a?o, como uma reinterpretac?a?o de cartel, pois\n\nas firmas te?m incentivo natural a aumentar a produc?a?o, em detrimento da reduc?a?o do\n\nlucro da indu?stria. O acordo de cartel deve ser escrito de forma que cada uma das firmas\n\nenvolvidas aceite o acordo de forma descentralizada. Partindo do modelo cla?ssico de Green\n\ne Porter, o contrato o?timo e? caracterizado e a esta?tica comparativa traz algumas respostas\n\npara a questa?o. Tanto o prec?o quanto o grau da externalidade afetam positivamente o n??vel\n\nde eficie?ncia poss??vel do contrato o?timo. Pore?m, enquanto o aumento nos prec?os viabiliza\n\nacordos de cooperac?a?o, elevado grau de externalidade podem conduzir a indu?stria para\n\nequil??brios ineficientes ou mesmo inviabilizar a produc?a?o. O mesmo ocorre quando os\n\ncustos fixos sa?o elevados, de forma que e? o?timo na?o produzir. Adicionalmente, quanto\n\nmaior for o nu?mero de firmas envolvidas no acordo, menor sera? a chance de existir um\n\ncontrato mais eficiente que a regra da captura.\n\nEste trabalho esta? dividido em duas sec?o?es. Na sec?a?o 2.2 apresentamos o problema\n\nque a indu?stria de hidrocarboneto esta? submetida. Em seguida, e? destacada a unitizac?a?o\n\ncomo uma alternativa para evitar ineficie?ncia na produc?a?o. Alguns resultados emp??ricos\n\ne teo?ricos sobre a viabilidade dos acordos de unitizac?a?o sa?o citados. Ao final da sec?a?o e?\n\napresentado o modelo de Green e Porter, o qual foi usado como base para este modelo. Na\n\nsec?a?o 2.3 e? apresentado o modelo formalmente e os resultados obtidos, como a caracteri-\n\nzac?a?o do contrato o?timo e a esta?tica comparativa para avaliar a eficie?ncia e a viabilidade\n\ndo contrato. Ao final do trabalho, na sec?a?o 2.4, comparamos os resultados obtidos com\n\nos modelos iniciais de unitizac?a?o.\n\n2.2 O problema dos recursos comuns e a unitizac?a?o\n\nA indu?stria de hidrocarbonetos exibe as caracter??sticas cla?ssicas de recursos de propriedade\n\ncomum. A dificuldade de mapear os reservato?rios antes do processo de licitac?a?o cria\n\ncondic?o?es para que blocos cont??guos estejam delimitados sobre uma mesma reserva. Neste\n\ncaso, as firmas podem se valer da regra da captura para decidir o n??vel de produc?a?o. Se-\n\ngundo esta regra, a propriedade do petro?leo e? concedida a firma que extraiu o recurso;\n\npore?m, devido a? natureza migrato?ria do hidrocarboneto, esta regra provoca uma extrac?a?o\n\npredato?ria das reservas, elevando os custos da produc?a?o. Em particular, a extrac?a?o exager-\n\n\n\n45\n\nada reduzira? demasiadamente a pressa?o interna do reservato?rio, podendo comprometer o\n\nfator de recuperac?a?o do reservato?rio com uma pol??tica predato?ria de produc?a?o. A? me-\n\ndida que a pressa?o se reduz, sa?o necessa?rios me?todos mais custosos para a extrac?a?o do\n\nhidrocarboneto. Assim, todas as firmas que produzem sobre um mesmo reservato?rio esta?o\n\nsujeitas a esta externalidade.\n\nUma alternativa para minimizar os efeitos da explorac?a?o exagerada e? o acordo de\n\nunitizac?a?o. Basicamente, este acordo e? celebrado entre firmas com o objetivo da produc?a?o\n\nconjunta do reservato?rio. A coordenac?a?o permite que a produc?a?o seja feita de forma mais\n\neficiente, se aproximando do n??vel de produc?a?o de monopo?lio. Uma forma de interpretar\n\neste acordo e? como a formac?a?o de um cartel. Neste caso, o cartel permite alcanc?ar resulta-\n\ndos mais eficientes em relac?a?o a? regra da captura, pois o acordo estabelecera? um n??vel de\n\nproduc?a?o do que considera a presenc?a da externalidade. Os ganhos de um acordo de coop-\n\nerac?a?o sa?o retratados por alguns autores, como Libecap and Wiggins (1984) apresentam\n\ndados do Federal Oil Conservation Board de 1926, que estima que a taxa de recuperac?a?o\n\nde petro?leo sob competic?a?o e? de apenas 20 a 25%, enquanto a taxa de recuperac?a?o quando\n\napenas uma firma operasse poderia alcanc?ar 85 a 90%. Ja? Libecap and Wiggins (1985)\n\napresentam estimativas ainda mais otimistas, a partir da publicac?a?o Oil Weekly de 1942,\n\nno qual a recuperac?a?o em a?reas unitizadas poderia aumentar a produc?a?o em duas a cinco\n\nvezes.\n\nApesar existir ganhos potenciais ao cooperar, a experie?ncia americana demonstrou\n\nque ha? dificuldades para conclusa?o destes acordos quando na?o ha? intervenc?a?o do gov-\n\nerno. Gary Libecap e co-autores escreveram trabalhos nos anos 1980 e 1990, explorando\n\nempiricamente esta dificuldade.1 Wiggins and Libecap (1985) afirmam que as principais\n\ndificuldades para conclusa?o dos acordos esta? relacionado com a assimetria de informac?a?o\n\ne incerteza geolo?gica. Segundo os autores, a unitizac?a?o pode atrasar ou na?o ocorrer em\n\nfunc?a?o da diverge?ncia sobre as estimativas do valor da jazida, ou seja, a incerteza esta?\n\ninduzindo a assimetria de informac?a?o.2 Outro motivo para atrasar uma unitizac?a?o pode\n\nser estrate?gico. Quando uma firma na?o entra na unitizac?a?o, gerara? perdas agregadas\n\nque afeta as firmas que participam da unitizac?a?o. Isto dara? maior poder de barganha\n\npara as firmas que na?o participam da unitizac?a?o, aumentando a partilha recebida por ela.\n\nContudo, ha? poucos trabalhos teo?ricos abordando este tema e como o ambiente afeta a\n\nviabilidade de um acordo de cooperac?a?o.\n\nA unitizac?a?o de jazidas de petro?leo pode ser uma reinterpretac?a?o dos acordos para\n\ncartelizac?a?o. No caso do cartel, cada firma tem incentivo a produzir acima no n??vel\n\n1Ver Libecap and Smith (1999), Libecap and Wiggins (1985) e Wiggins and Libecap (1985). Para\numa revisa?o um pouco mais ampla, ver Kim and Mahoney (2002).\n\n2O estudo geolo?gico e s??smico de reservato?rio pode ser interpretado de formas diferentes entre os\nespecialistas, mesmo que estejam usando os mesmos dados.\n\n\n\n46\n\nde produc?a?o que maximiza o lucro da indu?stria, pois assim teria maior participac?a?o no\n\nmercado e na receita. Deste modo, as firmas na?o esta?o internalizando que a produc?a?o\n\nexagerada reduzira? o prec?o de mercado. Analogamente, temos este resultado para o caso\n\ndos recursos de propriedade comum, como mostra a trage?dia dos comuns. A unitizac?a?o\n\nneste caso e? representada pela formac?a?o de um cartel; ou seja, de uma u?nica empresa\n\npara internalizar o custo da externalidade. Neste caso, o prec?o pode ser considerado fixo,\n\nmas a externalidade e? representada no custo de extrac?a?o do recurso, afetando assim o\n\nvalor presente do lucro esperado. Desta forma, o n??vel de extrac?a?o do recurso seria Pareto\n\nsuperior ao n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot3.\n\nPartindo da ideia da unitizac?a?o como formac?a?o de cartel, Deilami (1991) e? um dos\n\nprimeiros trabalhos teo?ricos sobre a unitizac?a?o. O autor analisa como o ambiente afeta\n\na viabilidade de existir um mecanismo descentralizado de cooperac?a?o fact??vel, ou seja,\n\nmecanismos que utilizam apenas o recurso gerado para compensar as firmas na?o produ-\n\ntoras. As firmas sa?o heteroge?neas e podem reportar falsamente seus custos marginais de\n\nproduc?a?o. Neste modelo, e? considerado o problema de definir o operador e partilhar o\n\nrecurso entre as firmas na unitizac?a?o. Os incentivos deste ambiente fazem com que as\n\nfirmas de custo elevado prefiram reportar um custo inferior para sinalizar que no caso de\n\nproduc?a?o competitiva, elas teriam retorno superior. Enquanto as firmas de custo baixo\n\npreferem reportar um custo superior para barganhar maior participac?a?o na partilha do lu-\n\ncro. No caso da unitizac?a?o na?o ocorrer, as firmas competira?o pelo recurso seguindo a regra\n\nda captura. O autor mostra que os prec?os aumentam o benef??cio da cooperac?a?o, facili-\n\ntando a existe?ncia de acordos. Note que prec?os elevados induzem a receitas maiores, que\n\npor sua vez aumenta o recurso dispon??vel para compensar as firmas na?o produtoras. Este\n\nfator na?o foi considerado pelo Wiggins and Libecap (1985).4 A magnitude da externali-\n\ndade do reservato?rio e os custos fixos tambe?m influenciam positivamente a factibilidade\n\ndo acordo, pois neste caso quando duas ou mais firmas produzem competitivamente, o\n\ncusto de extrac?a?o aumentara? em func?a?o da externalidade que cada um delas gera para as\n\ndemais; e quanto maior os custos fixos, devido a? duplicidade de custos fixos, menor sera?\n\no lucro gerado pela jazida.\n\nContudo, os resultados anal??ticos deste modelo dependem do nu?mero de firmas ser\n\ngrande o suficiente. Note que quando o nu?mero de firmas e? grande, o benef??cio de uma\n\nunitizac?a?o sera? maior e mais prova?vel neste modelo, pois maior sera? a economia gerada por\n\nna?o competir com custos fixos e externalidade. Esta hipo?tese na?o e? uma boa aproximac?a?o\n\nda realidade, pois quanto maior o nu?mero de firmas envolvidas num acordo, mais dif??cil\n\nsera? a conclusa?o dele. Mailath and Postlewaite (1990) apresentam um modelo de barganha\n\n3Neste trabalho, a alocac?a?o de Cournot se refere a? extrac?a?o quando as firmas na?o fazem acordo para\ncooperar.\n\n4Os dados utilizados por Wiggins and Libecap (1985) eram da de?cada de 1960. Os prec?os se elevaram\napo?s os dois choque de petro?leo da de?cada de 1970.\n\n\n\n47\n\ncom assimetria de informac?a?o, no qual mesmo que haja ganhos sociais de um acordo\n\nser conclu??do, quando o nu?mero de agentes aumenta se torna dif??cil de chegar a um\n\nacordo. Adicionalmente, o ambiente considerado por Deilami (1991) e? esta?tico e na?o ha?\n\nincerteza sobre o reservato?rio. Ao considerar interac?o?es repetidas podem surgir incentivos\n\ndistintos dos incentivos dos jogos esta?ticos. Interac?o?es repetidas permitem aos jogadores\n\nestabelecerem formas de punic?a?o no caso de deserc?a?o da cooperac?a?o. Green and Porter\n\n(1984) e Porter (1983b) desenvolveram um modelo cla?ssico que estuda uma indu?stria que\n\nenfrenta o problema de detectar e impedir desvios do n??vel de produc?a?o do acordo de\n\ncartel. Porter (1983a) observou que ocorriam episo?dios recorrentes de alterac?o?es no prec?o\n\ne lucro da indu?stria e tais alterac?o?es eram estatisticamente significativas. No modelo de\n\nPorter (1983b), a indu?stria incorre em custos para coletar e disseminar dados de prec?os e\n\nquantidades entre os membros, bem como custos para verificar a acuidade da informac?a?o.\n\nDesta forma, as firmas observam apenas sua pro?pria produc?a?o e o prec?o5 de mercado,\n\nmas na?o observam a quantidade produzida por cada uma das outras firmas. O autor\n\nconsidera um jogo de Cournot repetido infinitamente e representa esta incerteza usando\n\num componente estoca?stico na curva de demanda. Desta forma, uma queda inesperada\n\nnos prec?os pode sinalizar tanto um desvio da produc?a?o do cartel como um choque negativo\n\nsobre a demanda.\n\nNo ambiente considerado por Green e Porter, as firmas podem evitar desvios do\n\nn??vel de produc?a?o de cooperac?a?o usando uma estrate?gia de gatilho. Quando o prec?o de\n\nmercado fica abaixo do prec?o gatilho, as firmas produzira?o no n??vel de Cournot por um\n\ntempo fixado previamente, denominado de per??odo de punic?a?o. Uma firma que considere\n\nexpandir sua produc?a?o secretamente, deve ponderar o trade-off entre o ganho imediato de\n\nlucro com a elevac?a?o da probabilidade dos prec?os de mercado ficarem abaixo do gatilho de\n\nprec?os. Isto aumentara? a chance de haver lucros inferiores nos per??odos seguintes, uma vez\n\nque a indu?stria reverte o n??vel de produc?a?o para o equil??brio de Cournot. Green and Porter\n\n(1984) mostram que, mesmo no equil??brio na?o cooperativo, havera? episo?dios recorrentes\n\nde \u201cGuerra de Prec?os\u201d, ou seja, per??odos que a indu?stria produz competitivamente. Estes\n\nepiso?dios sa?o causados pelo choque negativo sobre a demanda, mas nunca por um desvio\n\nvolunta?rio de alguma firma.\n\nNa pro?xima sec?a?o sera? apresentada formalmente esta uma modificac?a?o do modelo\n\nde Porter (1983b) para aplica?-lo ao caso da unitizac?a?o. A motivac?a?o desta modificac?a?o\n\nconsiste em avaliar a eficie?ncia e a viabilidade da cooperac?a?o entre as firmas quando na?o ha?\n\nregulac?a?o. Para isto, e? caracterizado o equil??brio o?timo e a partir da esta?tica comparativa\n\nsera? avaliado como o prec?o, a incerteza e o grau de externalidade afetam a possibilidade\n\nde haver cooperac?a?o.\n\n5Por hipo?tese, a produc?a?o das firmas e? homoge?nea, logo o prec?o de mercado e? o mesmo para todas as\nfirmas.\n\n\n\n48\n\n2.3 Aplicac?a?o do Modelo de Green e Porter\n\nConsidere um jogo dina?mico em tempo discreto, no qual ? ? N firmas possuem direito\nde extrac?a?o de uma mesma jazida. A cada per??odo ? > 0, cada firma ? escolhe o n??vel de\n\nextrac?a?o6 ??? > 0 simultaneamente.

Neste modelo tambe?m ocorre a trage?dia dos comuns;\n\nou seja, o n??vel de extrac?a?o no equil??brio de Cournot e? superior ao n??vel de extrac?a?o\n\n8Usando a equac?a?o (2.5).\n9Ao longo do trabalho, o n??vel de produc?a?o de monopo?lio se refere a extrac?a?o igual a ? de cada uma\n\ndas plantas.\n\n\n\n50\n\neficiente, i.e., ? > ?, o que implica que o custo esperado de equil??brio sera? superior ao n??vel\n\neficiente. O lucro esperado no equil??brio de Cournot sera? estritamente inferior ao lucro\n\nesperado da alocac?a?o eficiente. Da mesma forma como ocorre no dilema dos prisioneiros,\n\no aumento da extrac?a?o unilateral implica retorno superior para firma ? em relac?a?o ao n??vel\n\nde extrac?a?o da unitizac?a?o.\n\nNo restante do trabalho, verificamos que e? poss??vel encontrar um acordo com n??vel de\n\nproduc?a?o Pareto superior a? produc?a?o do equil??brio de Cournot quando as firmas seguem a\n\nestrate?gia de Green e Porter. Neste ambiente, na?o existe um regulador e os acordos devem\n\nser implementados a partir de um equil??brio de Nash. Ou seja, mesmo atuando de forma\n\ncompetitiva, as firmas ira?o preferir fazer parte do acordo de unitizac?a?o para auferir lucros\n\nsuperiores, e na?o ira?o desviar do acordo. No caso de desvio, a probabilidade de incorrer\n\nem punic?a?o sera? maior. Logo o lucro esperado do desvio sera? inferior ao da unitizac?a?o.\n\nConsidere a estrate?gia na qual as firmas inicialmente extraem no n??vel determinado pelo\n\nacordo, e mante?m este n??vel de extrac?a?o ate? que o custo marginal observado ultrapasse\n\num gatilho de custo ?, previamente determinado.

A\n\npartir do per??odo ? apo?s o acionamento do gatilho, as firmas voltara?o a produzir no n??vel\n\ndeterminado pelo acordo. O per??odo de punic?a?o desta estrate?gia equivale ao caso em\n\nque voltam a competir de acordo com a regra da captura, produzindo exageradamente e\n\ncom custos elevados. Os per??odos cooperativos e na?o cooperativos podem ser definidos\n\nrecursivamente por\n\n(a) ? = 0 e? um per??odo cooperativo;\n\n(b) se ? e? um per??odo cooperativo e ?? 6 ?, enta?o ? + 1 e? um per??odo cooperativo;\n\n(c) se ? e? um per??odo cooperativo e ?? > ?, enta?o ? + 1, ..., ? + ? ? 1 sa?o per??odos na?o\ncooperativos, com n??vel de produc?a?o ?? = ?, e ? + ? e? um per??odo cooperativo.\n\nNote que na?o ha? desvio lucrativo do n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot para uma firma,\n\nquando todas as outras esta?o produzindo no n??vel de Cournot. Desta forma, a estrate?gia\n\nque as firmas ira?o seguir e? definida por10\n\n??? =\n\n??\n??, se ? for um per??odo cooperativo,?, se ? for um per??odo na?o-cooperativo.\n\nUma hipo?tese impl??cita do modelo se refere a? estacionaridade do problema dina?mico.\n\n10Na subsec?a?o 2.3.1 sera? mostrado que, em geral, na?o e? poss??vel alcanc?ar a produc?a?o de monopo?lio ?\nnos per??odos cooperativos.\n\n\n\n51\n\nCada firma esta? sujeita a? um processo de Markov estaciona?rio de dois estados (cooperativo\n\ne na?o cooperativo) com T per??odos.11 Portanto, quando as firmas seguem esta estrate?gia,\n\na func?a?o valor esperado descontado da produc?a?o satisfaz uma relac?a?o recursiva. Enta?o,\n\ndado que as firmas ira?o produzir ao n??vel ? predeterminado no acordo, o valor esperado\n\ndescontado para a firma ? e? definido por\n\n?? (?) = ?? (?) + Pr [?? 6 ?] ???

Caso o custo marginal observado seja inferior ao custo de gatilho,\n\no valor do pro?ximo per??odo sera? o valor do per??odo presente descontado por ?. Caso\n\ncontra?rio, as firmas recebera?o o lucro de Cournot por ? ? 1 per??odos e enta?o voltam a\ncooperar. Podemos reescrever a equac?a?o (2.7) como\n\n?? (?) =\n?? (?)\n\n1 ? ?\n+\n\n?? (?) ? ??

(2.8)\nPortanto, o valor para a firma ? e? o lucro esperado descontado de Cournot somado ao\n\nadicional de lucro dos per??odos de cooperac?a?o relativo ao lucro de Cournot, descontado de\n\nforma apropriada. Note que o fator de desconto do lucro adicional em relac?a?o ao lucro de\n\nCournot e? um fator de desconto esperado, dado por (1 ? ?) ?? + ??, onde o argumento\nde ? e? ?/???

A equac?a?o (2.9) representa o benef??cio e o custo marginal da produc?a?o para\n\na firma ?, sob a estrate?gia proposta. No equil??brio de Cournot, a firma ? maximizaria\n\nquando ??? (?\n?) = 0. Contudo, o lado direito da equac?a?o na?o sera? zero em geral.

Para verificar que ? e? uma alocac?a?o de equil??brio, note que lado direito de (2.9)\n\ne? trivialmente nulo. E? fa?cil verificar que ??? (?) = 0.

Portanto ? e? um n??vel de produc?a?o de equil??brio\n\nnos per??odos cooperativos.\n\nPodemos restringir o conjunto das alocac?o?es poss??veis de equil??brio.

Desta forma evitaremos o problema de conciliar\n\ninteresses distintos, e permite avaliar como a incerteza atua sobre a soluc?a?o de equil??brio.\n\nAdicionalmente, a proposic?a?o 4 restringe o conjunto dos n??veis de produc?a?o de equil??brio\n\nposs??veis, de modo que ?? ?

Portanto, em qualquer equil??brio\n\ndevemos ter que ?? ? (?/?,?].\n\nVimos pela proposic?a?o 3 que a func?a?o valor ??

A func?a?o valor deve\n\nser co?ncava em ?? quando todas as outras firmas esta?o no equil??brio de Nash. Como todas\n\nas firmas agem igualmente, a extrac?a?o que maximiza o valor de uma firma, e? o mesmo\n\nvalor que ira? maximizar o valor do recurso comum.\n\nUma condic?a?o suficiente para concavidade da func?a?o valor e? apresentada pela proposic?a?o\n\n5 a seguir.

A estru-\n\ntura de incentivos do contrato \u2014 a estrate?gia de punic?a?o do Green e Porter \u2014, garante\n\nque as firmas na?o desviem do n??vel de extrac?a?o ?? nos per??odos cooperativos. Portanto,\n\no custo ira? exceder o gatilho apenas nas realizac?o?es suficientemente altas do componente\n\nestoca?stico ?, e nunca por desvios unilaterais. Da mesma forma, na?o e? racional desviar\n\ndo n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot nos per??odos de reversa?o. Observe que realizac?o?es altas\n\nde ? implica elevados custos de externalidade. Sendo assim, a trage?dia dos comuns sera?\n\nprecedida por um per??odo cujo coeficiente de externalidade ex post, ??, e? elevado e na?o\n\npor desvios unilaterais das firmas.\n\n2.3.1 Desenho do contrato o?timo\n\nNesta subsec?a?o sera? caracterizado o gatilho e o per??odo de punic?a?o o?timo, que induzem\n\nn??veis de produc?a?o mais eficiente em relac?a?o ao n??vel de Cournot.

Enta?o basta\n\nescolher um valor inteiro superior e pro?ximo a ?.\n\nUma quantidade de equil??brio de Nash ?? deste modelo representa tambe?m a quan-\n\ntidade de equil??brio na?o cooperativo no espac?o das estrate?gias (?,?,?,?). Desta forma, ??\n\ne? a soluc?a?o da condic?a?o de primeira ordem (2.12), que e? uma func?a?o do gatilho de custos\n\n? e de ?, onde ? ? 1 e? o per??odo de punic?a?o. Consequentemente, a func?a?o valor esperado\nda firma ?, no equil??brio e? uma func?a?o do par (?,?), i.e. ?? (?\n\n?

Mas note que a simetria das firmas implica\n\nque maximizando para a firma ?, tambe?m estaremos maximizando para a indu?stria. Mas\n\no n??vel de produc?a?o que maximiza o lucro da indu?stria e? equivalente ao n??vel que minimiza\n\na ineficie?ncia da produc?a?o competitiva. Portanto, a escolha o?tima de ? e do ? implicam\n\n13Mais precisamente, as soluc?o?es interiores de ? sa?o tais que ?/???

Esta condic?a?o implica que ?? 6 0, logo a distribuic?a?o ? deve ser co?ncava.15\n\nComo veremos adiante, podemos interpretar ? como uma medida de ru??do sobre o custo\n\nmarginal, de forma que quanto menor for |?|, maior sera? a variabilidade do choque sobre\no custo. Na subsec?a?o 2.3.2 apresentamos um exemplo de distribuic?a?o que satisfaz esta\n\npropriedade, conhecida como distribuic?a?o de Pareto.

Mas como as firmas otimizam suas deciso?es, o n??vel de extrac?a?o\n\nescolhido pelas firmas sera? ?, pois ? e? sempre um equil??brio poss??vel e neste caso ??(?) >\n\n??(?\n?).\n\nUma forma alternativa de obter este resultado mostra a importa?ncia da concavidade\n\nda func?a?o de distribuic?a?o ? sobre o n??vel de extrac?a?o de equil??brio o?timo.\n\nProposition 7 O n??vel de extrac?a?o de equil??brio ?? e? uma func?a?o crescente de ??, com\n\ntaxa de crescimento dado por\n\n???\n\n???\n=\n\n??\n?\n\n?+(?+1)? ?\n?\n\n2??(?+??+1)2\n> 0, se ?? 6 ??\n\n0, c.c.,\n(2.18)\n\nonde\n\n?? = ?\n? + 1\n\n? ? 1\n\n[?\n? + (? + 1)\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n]?\n,\n\nque e? uma func?a?o decrescente de ?. Quando ?? tende para ??, ?? converge para ?, o\nn??vel de extrac?a?o de monopo?lio.\n\n16Esta na?o e? uma condic?a?o necessa?ria para este resultado. Caso ? > 0, seria poss??vel encontrar ??? tal\nque ?? (?\n\n? (???)) > 0 > ?? (?\n? (??? + 1)), e obter??amos o mesmo resultado.\n\n\n\n57\n\nProof. Como ?? &lt;0, enta?o ?? > ?/?, satisfazendo a proposic?a?o 4. Se ?? 6 ??, enta?o\n\n?? 6 ?. Quando ?? > ??, temos que ?? > ?. Neste caso ??(?) > ??(?\n?), e como ? e? sempre\n\num equil??brio de Nash, enta?o as firmas produziriam no n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot ?. A\n\nequac?a?o (2.18) e? obtida derivando (2.17) em relac?a?o ??, e lim????? ?\n? = ? e? trivialmente\n\nobtido a partir da equac?a?o (2.17).\n\nA medida que nu?mero de firmas cresce, menor sera? ??. Desta forma, mais dif??cil sera?\n\nencontrar um acordo tal que ?? &lt;?. Este resultado e? ana?logo a proposic?a?o 6. Quando o\n\nnu?mero de firmas for grande, e? necessa?rio que a distribuic?a?o seja \u201csuficientemente co?ncava\u201d\n\npara suportar um equil??brio mais eficiente que o equil??brio de Cournot.17 Outra forma de\n\ninterpretar o resultado, esta? relacionado ao ru??do do componente estoca?stico. No exemplo\n\nda subsec?a?o 2.3.2, fica claro que quando ? na?o for suficientemente negativo, estamos\n\nno caso em que ha? muito ru??do, ou ainda, a varia?ncia da distribuic?a?o e? elevada. Se a\n\nvaria?ncia e? elevada, se torna mais dif??cil definir um gatilho, pois o custo ira? variar muito\n\nmesmo que mantenha o n??vel de extrac?a?o constante. Isto dara? espac?o para comportamento\n\noportun??stico das firmas. A probabilidade das firmas entrarem no per??odo de punic?a?o sera?\n\nalta, logo sera? invia?vel manter um equil??brio Pareto superior ao equil??brio de Cournot.\n\nPodemos considerar este modelo como uma extensa?o do caso determin??stico. Quando\n\no ru??do do componente estoca?stico for baixo o suficiente retornamos ao caso determin??stico,\n\ne o equil??brio Pareto o?timo e? alcanc?ado. Note que mantendo a me?dia ? constante, quando\n\n?? tende para ??, a massa de densidade de probabilidade se acumula no ponto me?dio\n?, de forma que ?? converge para ?. Quando ? = 1, voltamos para o caso sem incerteza,\n\ne teremos que ?? = ???(??\n?) = ???(??). Logo e? poss??vel induzir um equil??brio Pareto\n\no?timo usando a estrate?gia de gatilho de Green e Porter. Quando ? for livre, a medida que\n\n? se torna mais co?ncava, maior sera? a densidade de probabilidade na parte inferior do\n\nsuporte. Ou seja, os choques baixos ocorrera?o com maior probabilidade. Tomando uma\n\ndistribuic?a?o com suporte (?0,?1), com ?1 > ?0, quando ?\n? tende para ??, teremos que no\n\nlimite Pr[? = ?0] = 1, ou seja, a externalidade ocorre no menor grau poss??vel e novamente\n\nestamos num caso sem incerteza. Isto pode ser observado no exemplo da subsec?a?o 2.3.2.\n\nVimos acima os dois casos extremos, quando ha? muito ru??do e o equil??brio sera? de\n\nCournot e quando a pouco ru??do e e? poss??vel induzir um equil??brio Pareto o?timo. Considere\n\nagora o caso intermedia?rio, quando ?? > ?? > ??, no qual na?o sera? poss??vel alcanc?ar\nresultados eficientes. A incerteza sobre a jazida dificulta definir um gatilho que induza as\n\nfirmas extra??rem no n??vel ?. A produc?a?o o?tima ?? sera? maior do que ?, pois caso contra?rio\n\na punic?a?o para induzir ?? &lt;? na?o seria fact??vel, uma vez que o desvio unilateral sera?\n\nlucrativo. Logo o resultado seria o n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot. Com ?? > ?, e? poss??vel\n\nencontrar uma punic?a?o, ou mais precisamente, um par (??,??), de modo que a punic?a?o\n\n17De forma mais precisa, e? necessa?rio que ?? seja suficientemente baixo.\n\n\n\n58\n\nseja fact??vel. Factibilidade da punic?a?o significa que existe um par (??,??) tal que as firmas\n\naceitam participar e que preferem respeitar o acordo, pois o retorno do desvio sera? inferior\n\nao retorno de respeitar o acordo. Temos enta?o o seguinte resultado:\n\nProposition 8 Suponha que ? e ? foram escolhidos de modo a maximizar o valor es-\n\nperado da explorac?a?o da jazida e a soluc?a?o o?tima e? interior, i.e. ? > 1 e ?/???(??\n?)\n\npertence ao suporte da distribuic?a?o ? . Suponha ainda que ?? > ?? > ??. Enta?o o\nn??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo ?? sera? maior do que o n??vel de extrac?a?o de monopo?lio ?, i.e.\n\n?? > ?. Como corola?rio, custo marginal de extrac?a?o sera? maior que no n??vel eficiente, i.e.\n\n???(??\n?) > ???(??).\n\nProof. Basta verificar que, quanto ?? for suficientemente baixo, da equac?a?o (2.17) temos\n\n? + ?? ? (? + 1) ?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n? + ?? + 1\n> 1,\n\npois tanto o denominador quanto o numerador sera?o negativos e????\n? + ?? ? (? + 1)\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n????\n> |? + ?? + 1| .\n\nVimos que o nu?mero de firmas afeta a viabilidade de acordos de cooperac?a?o. Quanto\n\nmaior o nu?mero de firmas, um n??vel de extrac?a?o mais eficiente se torna menos prova?vel.\n\nAdicionalmente, o prec?o ? e o coeficiente esperado da externalidade, ? = ??, tambe?m\n\ninfluenciam o n??vel o?timo de extrac?a?o. Lembre que ? = ? ? ??, onde ? e? o prec?o e ? e? o\ncusto marginal individual e que ?? = ?????(??\n\n?). Primeiro note que quanto mais elevado\n\nfor prec?o, maior sera? ??, o que torna mais prova?vel haver cooperac?a?o. Ao mesmo tempo,\n\ntemos que\n???\n\n??\n=\n???\n\n??\n\n??\n\n??\n=\n???\n\n??\n=\n\n? + ??\n\n2?? (? + ?? + 1)\n> 0\n\nlogo,\n???\n\n??\n=\n???\n\n??\n=\n\n?? (? + ??)\n\n2? (? + ?? + 1)\n> 0.\n\nQuando o prec?o e? elevado ou a diferenc?a entre o prec?o e o custo marginal individual\n\nfor elevado, a receita gerada pela jazida sera? maior. O n??vel de produc?a?o o?timo aumentara?\n\ncomo tambe?m o n??vel de produc?a?o de monopo?lio. Mas a taxa de crescimento de ? em\n\nrelac?a?o a aumentos marginais de ? ou ? sera? inferior ao aumento de ?? em relac?a?o a\n\naumentos marginais de ? ou ?. Ou seja, o n??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo aumentara? mais do\n\nque o n??vel de extrac?a?o de monopo?lio, e assim gerando resultados mais ineficientes. A\n\nraza?o disto ocorrer e? que a punic?a?o necessa?ria para manter o n??vel de extrac?a?o pro?ximo\n\ndo n??vel de monopo?lio deveria aumentar. Mas aumentando a punic?a?o, seja pelo aumento\n\n\n\n59\n\ndo per??odo de punic?a?o ou pela reduc?a?o do gatilho, aumentaria a ineficie?ncia da jazida, pois\n\nas firmas extrairiam no n??vel de Cournot com maior probabilidade. Quando se escolhe um\n\nn??vel de produc?a?o mais alto, permite que a punic?a?o seja mais branda, e assim o retorno\n\nesperado da jazida sera? maior.\n\nA externalidade reduz o lucro de desviar do acordo e pode melhorar o n??vel de\n\nproduc?a?o do acordo. Note que variac?o?es no coeficiente ? na?o afeta ??, e que\n\n???\n\n??\n= ?\n\n??\n\n?\n&lt;0\n\nlogo,\n\n??\n\n??\n= ?????? &lt;0.\n\nSe a externalidade e? alta entre as firmas, o n??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo se aproxima do\n\nn??vel de extrac?a?o de monopo?lio. No caso do monopo?lio havera? apenas aumento de custo,\n\npois na?o ha? outras firmas explorando a jazida. Assim, a reduc?a?o da produc?a?o na?o precisa\n\nser ta?o severa. No caso do acordo o?timo, a externalidade reduz o ganho de desviar do\n\nacordo, funcionando como uma punic?a?o. Isto permite punic?o?es mais brandas e que o n??vel\n\nde extrac?a?o se aproxime no n??vel de monopo?lio.\n\nVale observar que embora o custo fixo ? na?o tenha influe?ncia expl??cita sobre acordo\n\no?timo, implicitamente afeta todo o modelo. A medida que ? aumenta, sera? necessa?rio\n\naumentar o n??vel de extrac?a?o da jazida, gerando mais externalidade sobre as firmas. Isto\n\ndiminui o intervalo dos n??veis de extrac?a?o Pareto superiores ao equil??brio de Cournot. Se\n\no custo fixo for excessivamente alto, o u?nico equil??brio trivialmente sera? na?o produzir.\n\nPortanto, a soluc?a?o interior do acordo o?timo e? caracterizada pela seguinte proposic?a?o:\n\nProposition 9 Seja (??,??) o par da escolha o?tima que maximiza o retorno da jazida,\n\ne ?? o n??vel de extrac?a?o individual de equil??brio. Suponha que 1 &lt;?? &lt;? e que ?? ?\n??/???(??\n\n?) pertence ao suporte da distribuic?a?o ? . Enta?o a tripla (??,??,??) e? determinada\n\npor\n\n?? =\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n2??\n\n[?\n?+???(?+1) ?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?+??+1\n\n]?\n, se ?? 6 ??,\n\n?, c.c.;\n(2.19)\n\n?\n?(??)\n\n1 ? ?(??)\n?? ?\n\n? ?(??)\n\n?(??)\n?? = 1; (2.20)\n\ne\n\n?? =\n1\n\nln ?\nln\n\n{?\n? ?\n\n(1 ? ?)

(?) e ?? ? ??+1??1\n\n[?\n? + (? + 1) ?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n]?\n.\n\nAo longo desta subsec?a?o foram examinadas as soluc?o?es interiores do acordo de coop-\n\nerac?a?o o?timo. Contudo, os valores o?timos para ? ou ? ou ambos podem na?o ser interiores.\n\nDe acordo com Porter (1983b), e? poss??vel mostrar que ? interior e? uma condic?a?o necessa?ria\n\npara que exista equil??brios sime?tricos mais eficientes em relac?a?o ao n??vel de produc?a?o de\n\nCournot. Isto significa que, nesta modificac?a?o, o gatilho de custo ? nulo ou infinito im-\n\nplicaria que somente equil??brios de Cournot seriam observados. Note que um gatilho nulo\n\nsignifica que qualquer n??vel de produc?a?o positivo resultaria em per??odos de punic?a?o, logo\n\nna?o e? poss??vel suportar equil??brios mais eficientes neste caso. Um gatilho infinito significa\n\nque para qualquer n??vel de produc?a?o finita, o gatilho na?o seria atingido. Sendo assim, as\n\nfirmas voltam para o caso sem punic?a?o e portanto na?o haveria incentivo para as firmas\n\ncooperarem.\n\nPor fim, Porter (1983b) examina as soluc?o?es interiores para ?. Primeiro note que\n\n? > 1, pois caso ? = 1 significa que as firmas na?o seriam punidas, uma vez que o\n\nper??odo de punic?a?o e? dado por ? ? 1. Logo a soluc?a?o do modelo seria o n??vel de produc?a?o\nde Cournot. Desta forma, dentro das soluc?o?es na?o interiores, ?? infinito e ?? = ??/??\n\npertencer ao suporte de ? sa?o condic?o?es necessa?rias para existirem equil??brios sime?tricos\n\nmais eficientes que o equil??brio Cournot. Isto significa que o cartel deixa de existir a\n\npartir do momento em que o gatilho for excedido e que, de acordo com Porter (1983b), a\n\nexpectativa de vida do cartel e? dada por ?(??)?1, func?a?o que depende apenas do nu?mero\n\nde firmas e dos para?metros da distribuic?a?o. Contudo, o autor comenta que algumas\n\nfunc?o?es de distribuic?a?o na?o suportam equil??brios sime?tricos.\n\nNa subsec?a?o a seguir, apresentamos um exemplo para o caso das soluc?o?es serem\n\ninteriores.\n\n2.3.2 Exemplo com a distribuic?a?o de Pareto\n\nUma distribuic?a?o que satisfaz a propriedade ? + 1 6 0 e? a distribuic?a?o de Pareto. Esta\n\ndistribuic?a?o e? caracterizada por dois para?metros: ? > 0 que esta? relacionada com a cur-\n\nvatura da func?a?o distribuic?a?o e ?? que e? a moda da distribuic?a?o. A func?a?o de distribuic?a?o\n\ne? dada por\n\n?(?; ?,??) =\n\n??\n?1 ?\n\n(?\n??\n?\n\n)??\n, se ? > ??,\n\n0, caso contra?rio.\n(2.22)\n\nAssim, temos que\n\n? (?) = ?\n?\n\n?\n\n(?\n??\n?\n\n)??\n, ? ? (?) = ?\n\n? (? + 1)\n\n?2\n\n(?\n??\n?\n\n)??\n, E [?] =\n\n???\n? ? 1\n\ne Var [?] =\n??2?\n\n(? ? 2) (? ? 1)2\n.\n\n\n\n61\n\nA escolha desta distribuic?a?o decorre da facilidade para resolver o sistema de equac?o?es\n\nda proposic?a?o 9, pois ? e? constante, no suporte da distribuic?a?o:\n\n? =\n? ? (?) ?\n\n? (?)\n+ 1 =\n\n?? (?) ?\n1 ? ? (?)\n\n= ??\n\nUsando a proposic?a?o 9 podemos encontrar o n??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo,\n\n?? =\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n2??\n\n[?\n????(?+1) ?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n???+1\n\n]?\n, se ? > ??,\n\n?\n?(?+1)\n\n, se ? 6 ??,\n\nonde ?? = ?+1\n??1\n\n[?\n? + (? + 1) ?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n]?\n.\n\nNeste exemplo podemos reproduzir os resultados obtidos. Note que ?? e? uma func?a?o\n\ncrescente em ?, logo ?? e? decrescente em ?. Quando ? tende para infinito, teremos que ??\n\nvai para infinito tambe?m, e ?? vai para menos infinito. Logo, lim??? ??\n* = lim??? ?? =\n\n?\n?\n\n. Quando ? tende para o infinito, ?? se aproxima de ?. Note que neste caso Var(?) = 0,\n\ne retornamos para o ambiente sem incerteza. Adicionalmente, quanto menor for ?, maior\n\no ru??do sobre o modelo, e como conseque?ncia ?? se aproxima de ?. Logo, a elasticidade\n\nda func?a?o de distribuic?a?o ? em relac?a?o a ? tem um papel importante sobre a eficie?ncia\n\ndo modelo.\n\nPara ilustrac?a?o, considere o caso em que ? = 5, ? = 1, ? = 1/2, ? = 0, e ? = 3. Os\n\npara?metros da distribuic?a?o sa?o dados por ? = 15 e ?? = 14/15, logo ? = 1. Logo, temos\n\nque ? = 4, ? = 1/2, ?? = 8 e os n??veis de extrac?a?o e custo marginais sera?o ? = 4/3,\n\n???(??) = 3, ? = 2 e ???(??) = 4. O n??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo sera? dado por\n\n?? =\n\n??\n?\n\n4\n3\n(2??)\n(4??), se ? > ?\n\n?,\n\n2, se ? 6 ??,\n\ne o custo marginal de extrac?a?o o?timo sera? dado por\n\n???(?\n?) =\n\n??\n?1 + 2\n\n(2??)\n(4??), se ? > ?\n\n?,\n\n4, se ? 6 ??.\n\nO gatilho o?timo tera? um grau de liberdade, pois se ajustara? de acordo com a escolha\n\nde ?, e sera? dado por\n\n?? = ??\n\n[?\n1 + 2\n\n(?\n2 ? ?\n4 ? ?\n\n)?]?(?\n? ? ??\n\n1 ? ?\n5? (4 ? ?)\n8 (8 ? 3?)\n\n)?1\n?\n\n.\n\n\n\n62\n\nNeste exemplo e? poss??vel observar que a func?a?o valor sera? co?ncava no intervalo de\n\ninteresse (?/?,?], como e? mostrado na figura 2.1. Isto garante que e? poss??vel encontrar um\n\nma?ximo, quando todas as outras firmas esta?o extraindo no equil??brio de Nash.\n\nFigure 2.1: Func?a?o Valor ??\n\nss?n r q*\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nqi\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\nVi\n\nA figura 2.1 e? a representac?a?o gra?fica da func?a?o ?? quando as firmas ? ?= ? esta?o\nextraindo no n??vel estabelecido pelo acordo o?timo, ??.

Fica claro\n\nque se a firma ? produzir no n??vel do acordo o?timo, ??, estara? maximizando seu retorno.\n\nNeste exemplo, o retorno do monopo?lio, dividido entre ? firmas seria igual a 26,6667, com\n\nextrac?a?o agregada igual a 4 a cada per??odo, e o retorno no equil??brio de Cournot seria\n\nigual a 20, com extrac?a?o agregada igual a 6 a cada per??odo. Quando as firmas usam o\n\nacordo o?timo, o retorno e? igual a 21,9798 e a extrac?a?o agregada de cada per??odo e? 4,72727.\n\nPela simetria das firmas, o n??vel de extrac?a?o ?? tambe?m maximiza o retorno da jazida no\n\nambiente de Green e Porter.\n\nFigure 2.2: Condic?a?o de Primeira Ordem da firma ? quando ? ?= ? jogam ??\n\nr q*s?n s\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nqi\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nBenef\u00edcio e Custo Marginal\n\nO comportamento da firma ? pode ser avaliado na figura 2.2. A figura mostra o\n\n\n\n63\n\nbenef??cio marginal e o custo marginal da firma ?, quando todas as demais firmas esta?o\n\nextraindo no n??vel estabelecido pelo acordo o?timo, ??. A linha azul representa o custo\n\nmarginal dado pelo lado direito da condic?a?o de primeira ordem da firma ?, na equac?a?o\n\n(2.9), e a linha roxa representa o benef??cio marginal dado pelo lado esquerdo da mesma\n\nequac?a?o. A linha azul na?o e? cont??nua, pois a medida que ?? aumenta, a raza?o ?\n?/???(??\n\n?)\n\ndiminui, chegando a um ponto em que fica fora do suporte da distribuic?a?o de Pareto.\n\nA partir deste ponto, a a func?a?o sera? igual a zero.

Ou seja, e? o?timo para firma ? produzir no n??vel ??, quanto todas as\ndemais firmas produzem no n??vel ??.

O ganho agregado potencial da cooperac?a?o e?\n\nsuperior ao retorno da extrac?a?o pela regra da captura. Contudo Wiggins and Libecap\n\n(1985) e Libecap and Wiggins (1985) mostram a dificuldade do contrato ocorrer com\n\nsucesso. Dentre os motivos desta dificuldade, figuram a incerteza geolo?gica e a assimetria\n\nde informac?a?o inerente a? indu?stria de hidrocarbonetos.\n\nA unitizac?a?o pode ser tratada como formac?a?o de um cartel, no qual a cooperac?a?o\n\ndas firmas envolvidas pode gerar resultados mais eficientes. Neste sentido, Deilami (1991)\n\n\n\n64\n\ndesenvolveu um dos primeiros modelos teo?ricos aplicado a unitizac?a?o. Pore?m, este modelo\n\ne? tratado num ambiente esta?tico, que reduz o espac?o dos contratos compat??veis com\n\nincentivo. Quando consideramos um modelo dina?mico temos maior espac?o para incentivar\n\no conluio usando punic?o?es ao longo do tempo. Esta foi a motivac?a?o desta aplicac?a?o do\n\nmodelo de Green e Porter. Um modelo cla?ssico de formac?a?o de cartel, que considera a\n\nincerteza e a assimetria de informac?a?o foi desenvolvido por Porter (1983b). Ele analisa da\n\nviabilidade da cooperac?a?o neste ambiente. Desta forma, a reinterpretac?a?o deste modelo\n\npara o caso da unitizac?a?o e? oportuna.\n\nEste trabalho apresentou a modificac?a?o do modelo de Green e Porter para verificar a\n\nviabilidade de cooperac?a?o na explorac?a?o de recursos de propriedade comum. A incerteza\n\ngeolo?gica foi representada por um componente estoca?stico do custo de produc?a?o. O custo\n\nde produc?a?o varia de acordo com a produc?a?o das outras firmas. Neste sentido, a incerteza\n\ngeolo?gica esta? representada pelo coeficiente estoca?stico de externalidade do reservato?rio.\n\nMesmo que o custo seja comum entre as firmas, uma elevac?a?o no custo pode ocorrer\n\ntanto por uma realizac?a?o alta como por um desvio unilateral de alguma firma. Assim, a\n\nincerteza esta? induzindo a? incompletude de informac?a?o entre as firmas.\n\nO acordo o?timo entre as firmas foi caracterizado neste ambiente usando o espac?o\n\ndas estrate?gias de Green e Porter. Esta estrate?gia e? definida por um gatilho, representado\n\npelo custo marginal comum entre as firmas, e por um per??odo de punic?a?o. Quando o custo\n\nexceder um valor predeterminado, iniciara? o per??odo de punic?a?o. Durante este per??odo, as\n\nfirmas voltam a competir sob a regra da captura, reduzindo assim o retorno da explorac?a?o.\n\nO contrato o?timo permite que a explorac?a?o do reservato?rio seja feita de forma mais\n\neficiente do que a regra da captura, representado pelo equil??brio de Cournot. A partir\n\nda esta?tica comparativa, foi avaliado como a incerteza, o nu?mero de firmas, o prec?o e o\n\ncoeficiente de externalidade influenciam a viabilidade do acordo e a eficie?ncia da produc?a?o.\n\nA incerteza dificulta a cooperac?a?o entre as firmas, como Wiggins and Libecap (1985)\n\ndescrevem. Quanto maior o ru??do sobre o custo, menos informac?a?o uma firma tera? sobre\n\nas demais firmas. Desta forma, estabelecer o gatilho correto se torna invia?vel e o resultado\n\nsera? a competic?a?o pela regra da captura. Pode-se observar o mesmo resultado quando o\n\nnu?mero de firmas e? elevado. O ganho da cooperac?a?o na?o sera? suficientemente alto para\n\nque punic?a?o tenha efica?cia. Este resultado difere de Deilami (1991), que depende de um\n\ngrande nu?mero de firmas para obter os resultados anal??ticos.\n\nPrec?os elevados facilitam o acordo entre as firmas, pois o retorno esperado da co-\n\noperac?a?o sera? maior, assim como ocorre em Deilami (1991). Prec?os elevados facilitam o\n\nacordo entre as firmas, pois o retorno esperado da cooperac?a?o sera? maior, assim como\n\nocorre em Deilami (1991). Pore?m, o n??vel de produc?a?o sera? menos eficiente, uma vez\n\nque aumentos no prec?o elevam o retorno da regra da captura. Para evitar uma punic?a?o\n\n\n\n65\n\nsevera, que implicaria em aumento na durac?a?o da punic?a?o e menor eficie?ncia, o n??vel de\n\nproduc?a?o o?timo e? elevado. Assim, o retorno de um desvio sera? menor e a punic?a?o mais\n\nbranda. Embora o coeficiente de externalidade na?o influencie diretamente a viabilidade\n\nde um acordo, coeficientes elevados funcionam como uma punic?a?o pela na?o cooperac?a?o.\n\nDesta forma, coeficientes elevados permitem n??veis de produc?a?o mais eficientes, devido ao\n\nganho da cooperac?a?o ser superior. Mas se o coeficiente de externalidade for muito elevado,\n\nembora a viabilidade do contrato na?o varie explicitamente com este termo, pode ser que\n\nna?o haja equil??brio Pareto superior ao equil??brio de Cournot, ou mesmo a? um equil??brio\n\ntrivial com produc?a?o nula. O mesmo ocorre com o custo fixo neste modelo.\n\nPor fim, cabe ressaltar que o modelo usa hipo?teses pouco realistas. A primeira esta?\n\nrelacionada com o custo de produc?a?o e o tempo de produc?a?o. Neste modelo, a firmas\n\nproduzem por um tempo infinito, pois o custo de extrac?a?o na?o aumenta com o tempo.\n\nMas esta hipo?tese surge da necessidade do modelo usar a estacionaridade problema e da\n\nsoluc?a?o, como foi ressaltado na sec?a?o 2.3. Um extensa?o poss??vel seria o uso de uma func?a?o\n\nde custo que cresce a medida que o estoque se reduz. Pore?m, esta extensa?o na?o e? trivial,\n\numa vez que ha? poucos modelos com esta propriedade mesmo dentro da literatura de\n\norganizac?a?o industrial. Outra hipo?tese e? a simetria entre as firmas, que foi usada para\n\nisolar o efeito da incerteza sobre a viabilidade do contrato. Uma outra extensa?o poss??vel\n\nseria um modelo com duas firmas com tecnologia distintas. Assim, haveria tanto o efeito\n\nda incerteza quando a heterogeneidade entre as firmas. Pore?m, este modelo tambe?m na?o\n\nseria trivial, pois possivelmente \u2014 dependendo de como o choque ocorre a cada per??odo\n\n\u2014 seria necessa?rio usar me?todos de programac?a?o dina?mica estoca?stica, o que torna a\n\nresoluc?a?o do modelo tecnicamente mais dif??cil. Por fim, este modelo trata de ambientes\n\nsem regulac?a?o. Uma extensa?o natural poss??vel seria colocar o papel de um regulador com\n\npoder coercitivo, capaz de interromper a produc?a?o na eventualidade de uma deserc?a?o.\n\nEste modelo poderia reproduzir com um pouco de mais realidade a unitizac?a?o no caso\n\nbrasileiro.\n\n\n\n66\n\nRefere?ncias Bibliogra?ficas\n\nDeilami, I.

The\n\nnegotiation of share and production plan is modeled as a bargaining problem and\n\nwe solve it using the axiomatic solution proposed by Nash. We show that firms\n\noperating the leases that must share larger portion of its profit with the government\n\nend up being benefited in the negotiation. Furthermore, the regulator can reduce\n\nthe distortion generated by the dual fiscal regime if the regulator is impartial with\n\nrespect to government revenue and firms profits or worries more about firms than\n\nthe government.\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nIn the oil industry, the government grant licenses for companies to search for commercially\n\nfeasible deposits of petroleum. The geographical area defined by the government for the\n\ntender process is based on roughly estimates of possible oil leases. Due to the lack of\n\nprecise information, sometimes two or more oil companies end up having access to the\n\nsame reservoir. Without any regulation, whenever two or more companies have the access\n\nto the same resource, the overexploitation of it will occur as predicted by the common-\n\npool problem literature. Under this so-called Rule of Capture, each company will try to\n\nextract as much oil as it can, before the other companies do the same. It also increases\n\nthe production cost, since both companies have to make capital investments, creating two\n\n\n\n70\n\nstructures to extract the resource. This is not optimal for the society due the duplication\n\nof costs.\n\nA solution for this problem used by the industry is called unitization. This is an\n\nagreement in which it determines who will be responsible for extracting the resource,\n\nnamed operator, the production plan, and the profits will be shared. The agreement\n\nsometimes can reduce economic losses from the common-pool problem by 50%, according\n\nto Kim and Mahoney (2002). The negotiation between the parties can take a long time\n\nin general, due to the complexities involved on this agreement. However, sometimes this\n\nbargaining may breaks down and companies\u2019 decision will take into account the rule of\n\ncapture to produce, which would be wasteful. Aware of it, a government could demand\n\nfirms reach an agreement within a time limit and then offer a take-it-or-leave-it agreement.\n\nUnder this scheme, firms would incorporate it in the game to threaten the other parties\n\nduring the bargaining process.\n\nSince companies take into account a possible sharing rule offered by the regulator,\n\nit is important to consider the role of legal framework under which companies produce.\n\nJohnston (1994) surveys fiscal regimes around the world and shows that some countries\n\nare adopting the production sharing agreements (PSA) in which the government remains\n\nthe owner of the resources and only reimburses the cost of the oil companies and share a\n\nportion of the profit. The two special features of this contract are: (i) The government\n\ncan interfere the production plan; (ii) The oil company share the profit with the govern-\n\nment based on auction that the company won. The interference can occur, for example,\n\nwhen the bargaining process breaks down and the government offers a take-it-or-leave-it\n\nproposal.\n\nIn 2007, Brazil poised to become one of the top oil producers in the world after\n\ndiscovery a huge reserves in the pre-salt layer. The International Energy Agency (IEA,\n\n2013) estimates the country\u2019s oil production will triple by 2035, turning Brazil into the\n\nworld\u2019s sixth-largest oil producer, and the pre-salt layer will account for 52% of total\n\ndomestic oil production by 2018, according to the report by Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s semi-\n\npublic multinational energy corporation. It is estimated that the total recoverable oil and\n\nnatural gas to be about 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the pre-salt area, which\n\nwould triple the national reserves.\n\nIn response, the federal government considered necessary to amend the regulatory\n\nframework in order to create specific rules for the exploration and production of Petroleum\n\nin these areas. The new regulatory framework was proposed by the federal government in\n\n2009 and approved by the Brazilian Congress in 2010, which considered it would afford the\n\ngreatest benefit to the country and its people. The system adopted for the pre-salt reserves\n\nis the production sharing agreement. Now, Brazil have at least two fiscal regime for the\n\n\n\n71\n\noil industry, and some of the reserves might be under these two regimes. According to\n\nthe Brazilian law, firms operating contiguous leases with access to the same reserve must\n\nunitize their production, and the heterogeneous fiscal regime will affect the negotiation of\n\nthe unit agreement.\n\nUsing the axiomatic solution for bargaining, we show that even if the firms are\n\nidentical in terms of technology and costs, but operating under different fiscal regime,\n\none of the firm will be benefited in the unitization process. This benefit is associated\n\nto a larger share that a firm receives compared to the profit that the firm is helping to\n\ngenerate. We consider two possible resolution for the bargaining, that is, two possible\n\nscenarios if the negotiation breaks-down. The first one is the rule of capture, where firms\n\nwill compete for the resource, while the other one is the regulator proposal according to\n\nthe Brazilian law.\n\nIn the next section, we will introduce the Brazilian Fiscal regimes. In Section 3.3\n\nwe survey a short literature about unitization. In Section 3.4 we present our environment\n\nof the model and the common-pool problem. In Section 3.5, we introduce the unitization\n\nas a bargaining problem and we solve it using the axiomatic solution propose by Nash.\n\nIn Section 3.6 we study the two resolutions considered by this paper, and we conclude in\n\nSection 3.7.\n\n3.2 Brazilian Fiscal Regimes\n\nThe fiscal regime of a country is a regulation that rules the exploration and production\n\nof hydrocarbons, hence establishing the rights, obligations and the division of revenues\n\nbetween the government and companies. Throughout the world, we can find many fiscal\n\nregimes relative to the oil exploration and production (E&amp;P), but the two most common\n\nfiscal regimes are concession and production sharing agreement (PSA).\n\nAccording to the Brazilian Federal Constitution, enacted in 1988, all national oil\n\nand natural gas reserves were public property and belonged to the Federal Government.\n\nThe Union held a natural monopoly over research, exploration, production, refinement,\n\ntransportation, importation, and exportation of oil and its by-products. Petrobras, the\n\nBrazilian National Oil Company, was the sole agent to explore the Union\u2019s monopoly.\n\nIn 1995, the Brazilian government reformed the oil and gas regulatory framework,\n\nand authorized the Union to contract any company incorporated and headquartered in\n\nBrazil to conduct the activities previously reserved only to Petrobras. It ended the oil and\n\ngas public monopoly in Brazil. The Oil Act, enacted in 1997 by the Congress, allowed\n\ncompetition in all segments of the oil and gas industry, and established that exploration\n\nand production of oil and gas in Brazil should be carried out under the concession regime.\n\n\n\n72\n\nIn the concession regime, the exploration, development and production are con-\n\nducted at the oil company\u2019s sole cost and risk. In return, the concessionaire is granted\n\na contract that last up to 35 years, becoming the owner of the hydrocarbons extracted\n\nand having exclusive control of operations and holding both commercialization and ex-\n\nportation rights. The contracts are granted based on signature bonus and local content\n\nauction organized by the National Petroleum Agency (NPA). A signature bonus is the\n\namount of money offered by the bidder to explore and produce the field, paid when the\n\nconcession agreement is signed, and the local content represents the bidder\u2019s commitment\n\nto contract a minimum percentage of goods and services from Brazilian companies.\n\nTherefore, according to The Oil Act and concession agreements, the concessionaires\n\nmust pay (i) signature bonuses, which consist of a lump sum payment by the winning\n\ncompany(s) of the bidding procedure upon the signing of the concession agreement; (ii)\n\nroyalties, which are defined by law as a financial compensation payable as a result of\n\nproduction of Petroleum; (iii) annual rental fees, which consist of the value paid annually,\n\nfrom the execution of the concession agreement and fixed per square kilometer or fraction\n\nof the block area; and (iv) special participation, which is defined as an extraordinary\n\nfinancial compensation payable only in cases of high volume of production or high prof-\n\nitability. The special participation is a tax over the net revenue of the concessionaire based\n\non its location, onshore or offshore, and the production level. The two most important\n\ngovernment take in this regime, along with signature bonus, is the royalties and special\n\nparticipation, in terms of total revenue. According to the Statistical Yearbook of NPA\n\nof 2010, the royalties and special participation accounts for 50.6% and 47.8%, on average\n\nfrom 2000 to 2009, of the revenue not taking into account the signature bonus.\n\nIn late 2006, Petrobras announced it had found evidence of ultra-deep-water oil\n\nreserves beneath the underground salt layer, the so-called pre-salt. This layer extends\n\nalong the Brazilian outer continental shelf at about 300 kilometers from the shoreline.\n\nThe prospect of huge reserves of hydrocarbons in the pre-salt with low exploratory risk1\n\nraised discussion of whether concessions are the appropriate legal regime to govern the\n\ndevelopment of oil and gas in these locations. In response to that, a new regulatory\n\nframework was designed to govern the exploration and production of the oil discovered in\n\nthe pre-salt area, and in 2010, Brazil adopted the production sharing agreement regime.\n\nIn the PSA, differently from concession contracts, the ownership of the hydrocarbons\n\nis inverted, so instead of it being owned by the oil company, the extracted oil still belongs\n\nto the government. The contractor will, at its own risk, explore, develop and produce the\n\noil, and in the case of any commercial discovery, such contractor is entitled to receive a\n\nshare of the produced oil to reimburse the exploration and production cost, the so-called\n\n1Although the exploratory risk is reduced by the findings from Petrobras, the companies still bears\nthe development risk, which is considered very high in these areas.\n\n\n\n73\n\ncost oil. The remaining oil, the so-called profit oil, is shared between the government\n\nand the contractor according to the terms of the production sharing agreement, which is\n\nbased on bid proposed by the winning contractor for the lease auction. Thus, under the\n\nPSA, the government take is paid through its share of profit oil as well the payment of a\n\nsignature bonus and royalties.\n\nThe 2010 Federal law also established the Petro?leo e Ga?s Natural S.A. (PPSA), a\n\n100% government-owned company, to be responsible for managing the production sharing\n\nagreements and the sale of the government\u2019s share of oil output. The company represented\n\nthe Union in the PSA and in the unitization process, but it has no responsibility over\n\nexploration and production activities. PPSA does not bear exploratory and development\n\nrisk, but it has a mandatory participation in all consortia formed as well as the right to\n\nnominate the majority of the operational committee, including its president who has a\n\ntie-breaking vote. The Brazilian PSA also established the Petrobras as the sole operator\n\nof the oilfields, and it must have at least 30% of each field tendered. Petrobras may\n\nincrease its participation in the oil field by participating with the other parties. Finally,\n\nwhen the reserve is under two different leases, possibly under two different fiscal regimes,\n\nit is mandatory to unitize the production in order to reduce the cost of production of the\n\nreserve, and as soon as one consortia finds its reserves goes beyond its area, it must notice\n\nNPA. If the parties involved in the unitization process do not reach an agreement before\n\na deadline specified in the PSA, the NPA will propose an agreement, and in case it is not\n\naccept by the parties, their contract can be terminated.\n\nAs an example, the Table 3.1 presents the companies and government take under\n\ntwo different regimes. Under concession, it considers the royalty, denoted by ? as 10%,\n\nwhile in PSA we consider 15%, which is following the concession and PSA laws. Under\n\nconcession, we consider the special participation, denoted by SP, of 20%, and under PSA\n\nthe profit share is 50%. We consider a tax of 25% and the CSLL of 9%, for this example.2\n\nIt is clear that under PSA the government take is greater than under concession, which\n\nshould be related to the lower exploratory risk that consortia would bear.\n\nConsequently, Brazil now has a dual fiscal regime for hydrocarbons exploration and\n\nproduction: while the PSA governs exploration and production of the oil fields located\n\nin the pre-salt area as well as those considered strategic by a presidential decree, the\n\nconcession regime governs most of the other fields. However, since it is not possible to\n\ndelimit the areas according to the reserve, there will be situation in which companies\n\nhave to unitize their production, even operating under different regimes. This will be the\n\nfocus of this paper, to study how the dual fiscal regime will affect the negotiation of the\n\nunitization.\n\n2CSLL is the abbreviation for Contribuic?a?o Social sobre o Lucro L??quido (Social Contribution on Net\nProfits). It is one of the contributions destined to finance the Brazilian social security system.\n\n\n\n74\n\nTable 3.1: Company and government take example\n\nRegime\nConcession PSA\n\n(r = 10% and SP = 20%) (r = 15% and Share = 50%)\n\nGross Revenue 100 100\n\nRoyalties 10 15\n\nCosts 30 30\n\nNet Revenue 60 55\n\nSP 12 0\n\nProfit Oil 0 27.5\n\nFirm Gross Profit 48 27.5\n\nTax 12 6.875\n\nCSLL 4.32 2.47\n\nFirms Net Profit 31.68 18.15\n\nFNP/(Rev-Cost) 45.3% 25.9%\n\nGov.

In most of the states, the ownership of the underground resources was\n\ninitially given to the company that extracted the oil, the so-called rule of capture. A\n\nlandowner neighbor of a land in which the oil was found had incentives to rent his land\n\nto an oil company, which would extract the oil probably from the same oil reserve. This\n\ncompetition and the decreasing crude oil prices experienced until 1970 became a concern\n\nfor the industry, and a topic for economist to discuss.\n\nGary Libecap and Steven Wiggins studied the competition in the industry and its\n\nrent dissipation, among others, during the 1980s. Libecap and Wiggins (1984) show\n\nan estimate from Federal Oil Conservation Board that the estimated recovery rate was\n\nonly 20 ? 25% under competitive extraction, while under controlled withdrawal could\nbe 85 ? 90%. As firm compete for migratory oil and gas, they dissipate reservoir rents\nwith excessive capital, too rapid production, and lost total recovery. However, with a\n\ncomplete unitization agreement among the producers, a single firm is designated as the\n\nunit operator to develop the entire reservoir. The gains from an agreement can be huge\n\nboth from savings in capital costs and from increasing the overall production that can be\n\nfrom two to five times unregulated output.\n\nEven though there is a huge rent dissipation due to the rule of capture, studies\n\n\n\n75\n\nshowed that by 1947, only 12 in 3,000 fields in the US were fully unitized. Libecap and\n\nWiggins (1984, 1985a) considered three possible causes for this failure of reaching an\n\nagreement. The first one is the concentration in the field, as the more firms have access\n\nto the same tract, the harder will be to reach a mutual interest agreement. Another rea-\n\nson, related to the previous one, is the heterogeneity of firms\u2019 interest and information.\n\nAs most of the unitization process started during development phase after the commer-\n\ncial petroleum deposits have been found, the information about firms\u2019 tracts and their\n\nestimated about the value of it diverges, making it harder for parties reach an agreement.\n\nIn a comparative analysis, Libecap and Wiggins (1985b) evaluated how different\n\nregulatory policies affects the unitization process in the US. They chose three US states\n\nthat have different regulatory policies with high production level. In Wyoming was ob-\n\nserved high level of success in achieving unitization agreements. In this state, most of\n\nthe oil field are federal land, where the policy encourages early exploratory units, before\n\nthe commercial petroleum deposits have been found. It allows for large potential gains\n\nfrom unitization, and ease the bargaining process since the information about the deposit\n\nis more homogeneous. The Brazilian regulatory framework adopted the same principle,\n\nwhere firms must notice NPA as soon as it is found that the tract extends beyond their\n\nlease. Another incentives provided by the federal policy in the US is that firms are granted\n\nthe area for up to 20 years, but if a lease become unitized, the leases are automatically\n\nextended for the life of the unit. In the other states, the unitization typically starts in late\n\nfield development, and it was observed lower number of successful unitization agreements.3\n\nMore recently, Libecap and Smith (1999, 2001) shows that if the field contains two\n\n(or more) substances that differ in kind (like oil and gas), then it is possible that different\n\nforms of non-unitized ownership and operation (with conflicted production incentives)\n\nmay dominate unitized development of the resource.4 According to them, unitization\n\nmay not be a Pareto improving in situations where the tract contains oil and gas, due\n\nto different interests about timing and forms of extraction needed. Mohan and Goorha\n\n(2008) showed that the nature of contractual incompleteness of the unitization could also\n\nprovide wrong incentives to firms, resulting in an under-investment during the exploratory\n\nphase.\n\nIn a setting more closely related to ours, Smith (1987) solves an axiomatic bar-\n\ngaining, and shows that small-interests holders are benefited in the unitization when the\n\nalternative solution is the rule of capture. This idea follows Libecap and Wiggins (1984,\n\n1985a) hypothesis, where it was shown that small firms are reluctant to enter agreements,\n\nexpecting that large firms offer concession for the small firms. Smith argues that, if arbi-\n\n3For an extensive comparative analysis of country regulation about unitization, see Weaver and Asmus\n(2006).\n\n4For an extensive review about what involve the unitization contracts, see Libecap and Smith (1999).\n\n\n\n76\n\ntration were possible, and neutral with respect to distribution of the profit, large-interests\n\nfirms would issue a threat to invoke arbitration, if the cost for it is not sufficiently high.\n\nDifferently from our model, the firms\u2019 difference is exogenous; he does not consider the\n\nfiscal regime the firms are operating. Thus, our model shows explicitly the effect of the\n\nfiscal regime over the bargaining position of the firms involved in a unitization process.\n\nAlso, we show the role of a regulator that consider both government take and firms profit.5\n\n3.4 The Environment\n\nWe consider two firms in this model, which are operating over their granted land to\n\nexplore and develop oil, but the oil extracted by the firms comes from the a single reservoir\n\nunderneath their areas. In our model, the average production cost is represented by the\n\nfunction ???(?1,?2), and it satisfies the following assumption of externality, leading to the\n\ncommon-pool problem:\n\nAssumption 1 ???(?1,?2) = ??? + ?(?1 + ?2) and\n????\n????\n\n= ? > 0.\n\nThus, the extraction by one of the firms leads to an increase in the production cost of the\n\nother firm. We suppose the price of the produced oil is given by ?, thus the gross profit\n\nfunction for a firm ? is\n\n????(?1,?2) = [? ? ???(?1,?2)] ??. (3.1)\n\nEach firm may be operating under different fiscal regime. We consider two possible\n\ntypes of contract that can be used by the government to lease areas for exploration and\n\ndevelopment of oil. The fiscal regime determines the economic relation between firms and\n\ngovernment, and in particular, what is the government take on the total output revenue.\n\nThe first type of contract we describe is the PSA, described in Section 3.2. Under this\n\ncontract, the profit from the production is shared with the government according to the\n\nparameter ??, established during the auction, and the firm still needs to pay royalties to\n\nthe government. The (net) profit function is\n\n??(?1,?2) = (1 ? ??) [????(?1,?2) ? ????] , (3.2)\n\nand, as we assume there is no tax, thus the government revenue is given by\n\n5Regarding the PSA contracts, Aghion and Quesada (2010) study the moral hazard and risk sharing\nproblem that affects the production under different contracts, where they consider that government\nmay change the agreement to increase its take, like what happened in Venezuela and Bolivia, and thus\ncompanies anticipate this possibility of holdup and under-invest. For a survey about the PSA fiscal\nregime, see Johnston (1994), and for a comparison of the legal framework between Brazil and the US, see\nPinto (2013).\n\n\n\n77\n\n?(?1,?2) = ?? [????(?1,?2) ? ???] + ???. (3.3)\n\nThe other type of fiscal regime is a concession contract, which grants the lease to a\n\nfirm in exchange for a fixed payment in advance and requires the firm to pay the royalties\n\nbased on the production. The advanced payment is sunk for the firm at the exploratory\n\nand development phase, so the production level takes into account only the royalty, along\n\nwith price and production cost. We consider royalties as a function of the production\n\nlevel. Therefore, the (net) profit function and government revenue can be represented by\n\nEquations (3.2) and (3.3) when ?? is zero.\n\nIn order to easy the computation, we will also consider that firms are identical, so\n\n?1 = ?2 = ?, and the royalty will be the same under both regimes, based on the production\n\nof the firms, thus ?1 = ?2 = ?. By doing it, we are isolating the problem of the fiscal\n\nregime, excluding the heterogeneity of the firms and evaluating only the impact of the\n\nexistence of two fiscal regimes over the unitization process. In addition, throughout this\n\npaper, we will consider only interior solution. In the next subsection we will show the\n\ncommon-pool problem under these fiscal regimes.\n\n3.4.1 The common-pool problem\n\nIn this section we introduce the common-pool problem existing in this setting. In order\n\nto do so, we examine two benchmark cases: (i) when firms act non-cooperatively by\n\nstrategically choosing a production level seeking to maximize his own profit; and (ii) firms\n\nact as one and seeks to maximize the joint profit.\n\nFirst, let us consider what would happen if both firms were acting according to the\n\nrule of capture. It establishes that the ownership of the resource extracted is given to firm\n\nresponsible for extracting it. This allocation rule induces firms to act strategically, seeking\n\nto extract as much as possible without considering its negative effects over the other firm.\n\nA simple solution concept that captures this behavior is the Nash equilibrium, which will\n\nrepresent the case when firms are competing against each other when the allocation rule\n\nis determined by the rule of capture. Henceforth, this solution concept will be called as\n\nrule of capture solution.\n\nFirms seeking to maximize their profit function (3.2) do not take into account the\n\nfiscal regime ??, as it is just a fixed proportion of its profit. On the other hand, the\n\nroyalty ? acts as an additional marginal cost for the firm, thus reducing the output level\n\nof both firms. As we consider both firms identical in terms of cost structure, the rule of\n\ncapture solution involves both firms choosing the same output level denoted by ?? , where\n\n? indicates the Nash equilibrium concept. The externality introduced in the previous\n\n\n\n78\n\nsection reduces the total profit that firms could make if they behave as a single firm\n\noperating in two different fiscal regimes, as they would be internalizing the externality of\n\nthe setting, as we can see in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 10 The total profit under the rule of capture is strictly less than the profit\n\nmade by a single firm operating two distinct areas.\n\nProof. Consider the problem of a single firm operating two areas under different fiscal\n\nregime, which is given by\n\nmax\n?1,?2\n\n??\n?=1,2\n\n(1 ? ??) [????(?1,?2) ? ???] . (3.4)\n\nWe denote ?*? the solution for this problem and ?\n* = ?*1 +?\n\n*\n2. The first order condition for\n\nthis problem implies that the total marginal profit is greater than zero, while summing\n\nthe first order condition of each firm from the rule of capture solution, using the same\n\nnotation ?? = ??1 + ?\n?\n2 , it implies\n\n? ? ??? ? ?\n??\n\n2\n? ??? = 0 &lt;? ? ??* ? ?\n\n?*\n\n2\n? ??*. (3.5)\n\nThe inequality above implies that the total production under a single firm operation is\n\nless than under a competitive solution, i.e. ?? > ?*. Since the cost function is strictly\n\nconvex, and prices are fixed, thus the total output from competition is strictly less than\n\nthe profit made by a single firm operating both areas.\n\nThe common-pool problem occurs when a firm does not take into account the neg-\n\native externality the others firms will bear due to its production. In the oil industry, this\n\nwould mean that firms should reduce its production, since the costs become higher due\n\nto competition, as they would have to introduce more costly ways of extraction. In our\n\nstatic model, we are not considering the stock level and the cost associated to it, but the\n\ncompetition induces firms to produce more at higher costs, and thus the profit reduces.\n\nThe total profit loss due to competition could be internalize if firms cooperate and\n\nthen split the profit between them. However, it is not a trivial problem to decide the\n\nproportion of the profit that each player will receive. In the next section we solve this\n\nproblem using the Nash\u2019s Bargaining solution.\n\n3.5 The Bargaining Problem\n\nConsider a model in which two firms found that they have access to the same oil reservoir.\n\nDue to the common-pool problem, competition would reduce the total profit that would\n\nbe possible to achieve if they cooperate. However, negotiating a cooperation agreement\n\n\n\n79\n\ninvolves attrition about sharing rule for the profit. According to Osborne and Rubinstein\n\n(1990), this is a typical bargaining situation, because cooperating is mutually beneficial\n\nand there is a conflict of interest about which agreement to conclude.\n\nWe are interested in studying how the dual regimes affects the negotiation between\n\nfirms. Thus, we model the unitization process as a Nash solution to a bargaining game\n\nbetween both firms over the agreement that includes the production plan (?1,?2), and\n\na sharing rule ? ? [0,1], where ? represents the joint-profit portion given to firm 1.\nSuppose the profit function of each firm is denoted by ?? (?1,?2), so the joint-profit is\n\n? (?1,?2) =\n??\n\n? ?? (?1,?2). As it was discussed above, sometimes the bargaining process\n\nbreaks down, so the firms would compete for the resource or the government could offer\n\na take-it-or-leave-it agreement. We will analyze both resolution on Section 3.6. For the\n\nmoment, these threat points are denoted by ??. Nash (1950) showed that we can solve\n\nthis problem by the following maximization\n\nmax\n(?,?1,?2)??\n\n{?? (?1,?2) ? ?1} \u00b7 {(1 ? ?) ? (?1,?2) ? ?2} (BP)\n\nwhere ? = {(?,?1,?2) : ? ? [0,1] and ?? ? R+ for ? = 1,2} is the feasible choice set.\n\nFigure 3.1 shows a representation of the stake of the bargaining. Both vertical and\n\nhorizontal axis represents the profit of each firm, in particular, the vertical axis represents\n\nfirm 1 profit, and the horizontal axis represents firm 2 profit. The green line represents\n\nthe profit possibility frontier, which is found by solving the following problem, for each\n\npossible ?2,\n\nmax\n?1,?2\n\n?1(?1,?2) s.t.?2(?1,?2) = ?2.\n\nThe point ? = (?1,?2) represents the threat point of each firm, and it is given by the\n\noutside option that firms have. For example, a firm could prefer not to agree to any deal\n\nproposed, and decide to compete for the resource according to the rule of capture, if it is\n\npossible. Thus, the profit this firm would have is equal to the rule of capture profit level.\n\nHowever, due to the common-pool problem, we can see that there exist deals that can\n\nimprove both firms payoff, represented in the blue area.\n\n\n\n80\n\nFigure 3.1: Optimal production plan\n\nAccording to the axiomatic bargaining proposed by Nash, we know that the solution\n\nmust be Pareto optimal, otherwise there would still be a room for a costless negotiation\n\nthat could improve both players. Since both firms are splitting the profit generated,\n\nit would be optimal for them when they choose the production plan (?1,?2) such that\n\nmaximize the total profit ?(?1,?2). Let ?\n* = (?*1,?\n\n*\n2) be the optimal production plan\n\nwhen players cooperate and produce at the quantity that maximize the total profit ?(?).\n\nTherefore, under a unitization we can solve the problem of common pool, since only one\n\nof the firms will explore the reservoir, and in order to maximize his payoff, he must choose\n\nthe optimal production, which will generate the highest payoff for both firms.\n\nLet ?* = ?(?*1,?\n*\n2), thus the unitization problem can be reduced to the problem of\n\nsplitting the profit, i.e.\n\nmax\n?\n\n{??* ? ?1} \u00b7 {(1 ? ?) ?* ? ?2} . (BP\u2019)\n\nNow, the problem of how the firms actually share profit shows the importance of\n\nthe threat points, as we can see it clearly from the first order condition:\n\n? =\n1\n\n2\n+\n?1 ? ?2\n\n2?*\nand 1 ? ? =\n\n1\n\n2\n+\n?2 ? ?1\n\n2?*\n(3.6)\n\nFrom these equations, it is clear that whenever the threat point is the same for both\n\nfirms, they will share the profit equally to each other, otherwise one of them will end up\n\nreceiving a large share. Clearly, player ? will have greater share when he generates more\n\nprofit at the threat point.\n\n\n\n81\n\nIn the next section we present two models of breakdowns we induces the threat point\n\nof the firms. Based on them, we study the solution of the bargaining problem introduced\n\nabove.\n\n3.6 Two Models of Negotiation Breakdown\n\nThe unitization process involves a complicated phase where companies work on the deal\n\nthey want to reach. The firms negotiating the deal are usually aware of what the other\n\ncompany can do if an agreement is not reached, and they use it to get the best possible\n\ndeal. This is the threat point considered by the Nash solution for a bargaining. As we saw\n\nin the previous section, the bargaining solution will depend on the threat point that comes\n\nfrom the solution of possible resolutions the game have. A natural threat point would\n\nbe a non-cooperative solution, when firms compete for the oil and face the common-pool\n\nproblem. The other option is when the regulator proposes an agreement and firms can\n\naccept it or not, following the idea of the Brazilian regulatory framework. If they do not\n\naccept, the government will terminate their contract and they will end up with no profit.\n\nIn this section, we will see how the fiscal regimes affect the unitization, first consid-\n\nering the benchmark case, where firms will compete for the resource according to the rule\n\nof capture. In this situation, both firms can improve their profit due to the common-pool\n\nproblem by cooperating, the question is how the fiscal regimes will affect the bargaining\n\nof the shares and thus if it will involve any transfer between players.\n\n3.6.1 Rule of capture resolution\n\nThe rule of capture states that the ownership of the resource extract from the nature\n\nbelongs to the one who extracted it. In the past, in some countries like United States, the\n\ngovernment did not interfere in the competition in the oil industry. This is our benchmark,\n\nas now we will consider the rule of capture as our status quo condition, in the sense that if\n\nfirms cannot reach an agreement, they will compete according to the rule of capture. As\n\nwe saw before, it can be viewed as the Nash equilibrium for the common-pool problem,\n\nwhich solution was called rule of capture solution. Thus, the threat point is given by\n\n?? = ?\n?\n? . By using it as a threat point, it becomes an individual rationality condition,\n\nwhich is the minimum a firm must receive to accept a deal from the bargaining.\n\nAs seen in the previous section, the solution of the bargaining is such that a firm\n\nwill receive a portion of the joint profit, ?? ?*, when the production plan is the one that\n\nmaximize the joint profit, and ?* is a function of the threat points, given by Equation\n\n(3.6).\n\nProposition 11 The firm that will receive larger shares is the one with lower government\n\n\n\n82\n\nshare.\n\nProof. The rule of capture solution can be found by solving the system of equations that\n\ninduces the Nash equilibrium of the game, which is the following: The output choice for\n\neach firm ? solves\n\n??? = arg max\n??\n\n(1 ? ??) [????(?1,?2) ? ???] . (3.7)\n\nIt is clear that the output choice of each player does not depend on the fiscal regime\n\n??, as it is a constant for each firm. However, the profit is a decreasing function of ??. So,\n\nsuppose, without loss of generality, that ?2 > ?1, thus the firm 2 has lower profit than\n\nfirm 1, that is, ??1 > ?\n?\n2 , and finally, according to the Equation (3.6), ?\n\n? > 1/2. Thus,\n\nthe firm that shares large portion of the profit receives lower share of the total profit.\n\nAlthough firm 2 received larger portion of the joint profit, it might be the case that\n\nhe will receive less than his facilities usage generates as profit due to a transfer to firm 1\n\nin terms of profit share. The role of the transfer is to insure the deal will be reach, and\n\nthe firm with larger benefit from cooperation will be more willing to pay to the other firm.\n\nWe can see that the firm with higher threat point gets a larger share of the profit, but\n\ndoes this payoff is equal to the firm contribution for the total profit? Let the transfer be\n\ndefine as the amount of payoff a player receives in excess of his contribution to total profit.\n\nSo, for example, the transfer received by the player 1 is given by ??1 = ?\n? ?* ? ?1(?*1,?*2).\n\nWhen ??1 > 0 means that the firm 2 is giving implicit transfer for firm 1 to be able to\n\nreach an agreement. This transfer occurs by giving by a larger share of the profit to one\n\nplayer in order to guarantee the deal. At the solution, this transfer is given by\n\n??1 =\n?2(?\n\n*) ? ?1(?*)\n2\n\n+\n??1 ? ??2\n\n2\n, (3.8)\n\nand ??2 = ???1 . We can see the representation of the transfer in the Figure 3.2. In\nthis figure, firm 2 is receiving a transfer from firm 1, after using the threat point as his\n\nbargaining position, since player 2 won\u2019t be benefited as much as player 1.\n\nNote that the firm 1 will receive the transfer when ?2(?\n*) ? ??2 > ?1(?*) ? ??2 , that\n\nis, when his gain from cooperation is less than the other player\u2019s gain. The idea here is\n\nthat the player with lower gain from cooperation will ask a transfer in order to agree with\n\nthe terms of the deal. The cooperation generates more benefits for the other firm, hence\n\nhe would be willing to transfer some of its benefit from cooperation and still be in a better\n\nsituation than the status quo, where the regulator would impose them an agreement.\n\n\n\n83\n\nFigure 3.2: Transfer\n\nBefore studying who receives transfer, we need the following lemma. The problem\n\nfor a single firm operating two areas with different fiscal regimes is also called cooperation\n\nproblem, when two firms do not acts strategically to extract larger profit from the lease.\n\nLemma 4 If a single firm were operating under two different fiscal regimes, the area\n\nresponsible to produce more and to generate more profit for the firm is the one with lower\n\ngovernment share.\n\nProof. Without loss of generality, assume ?1 > ?2. First, let us show that ?\n*\n2 > ?\n\n*\n1. The\n\nfirst order condition to solve problem (3.4) implies for each firm ? the following equation\n\n?????(?\n*\n1,?\n\n*\n2)\n\n???\n= ? +\n\n1 ? ??\n1 ? ??\n\n??*? , (3.9)\n\nand using the Equation (3.1) we can compare both first order condition through the\n\nfollowing equation\n\n? ? ??* ? 2??*1 =\n1 ? ?2\n1 ? ?1\n\n(? ? ??* ? 2??*2) . (3.10)\n\nBy the assumption ?1 > ?2, we have\n1??2\n1??1\n\n> 1, and thus it is clear that ?2 > ?1 by the\n\nEquation (3.10), proving the first part of this lemma. Now, let us prove that the plant on\n\narea 2 has greater profit than the facilities located on the area that shares larger portion\n\nof the profit with the government. In order to prove it, we assume again that ?1 > ?2,\n\nwhich implies that 1??2\n1??1\n\n> 1 > 1??1\n1??2\n\nand ?2 > ?1. According to the first order condition\n\nstate by Equation (3.9), we have the following inequalities\n\n????1(?\n*\n1,?\n\n*\n2)\n\n??1\n= ? +\n\n1 ? ?2\n1 ? ?1\n\n??*2 > ? + ??\n*\n2 > ? + ??\n\n*\n1 > ? +\n\n1 ? ?1\n1 ? ?2\n\n??*1 =\n????2(?\n\n*\n1,?\n\n*\n2)\n\n??2\n, (3.11)\n\n\n\n84\n\nand by concavity of the profit function, it implies that ???1(?\n*\n1,?\n\n*\n2) &lt;???2(?\n\n*\n1,?\n\n*\n2), and thus\n\n?1(?\n*\n1,?\n\n*\n2) &lt;?2(?\n\n*\n1,?\n\n*\n2).\n\nThe production plan as a solution of the cooperation problem is affected by the\n\nfiscal regime. The choice is such that the firm that pays lower portion of the profit to\n\nthe government will produce more, increasing its profit, while the other one will reduce\n\nthe production, internalizing the externality, which is now a composition of the fiscal\n\nregimes and the externality parameter. The regimes makes each firms be affected by the\n\nexternality with different intensity. The firm with larger ?? will be less sensitive to the\n\nexternality, as we see the fraction (1 ? ??)/(1 ? ??). Note that in this problem, each firm\nhas a weight given by 1 ? ??, so, the firm with lower ?? will have larger importance in\nthe maximization problem, and so it would be responsible to generate larger profit, while\n\nthe other firm should reduce its production in order to reduce the negative externality.\n\nTherefore, the firm with lower ? can increase the production and thus increase the profit,\n\nwhile having a minor negative effect from the other firm.\n\nNow we can study which firm receives a transfer ??? . When the fiscal regime is the\n\nsame, that is ?1 = ?2, at the rule of capture solution we have ?\n?\n1 = ?\n\n?\n2 , and at the\n\ncooperative solution, firms\u2019 profit will be the same, i.e. ?*1 = ?\n*\n2. Thus, there will not be\n\na transfer from one firm to another. However, when the fiscal regime is different, we have\n\nthe following proposition.\n\nProposition 12 The firm receiving transfer is the one with larger government share.\n\nProof. Assume, without loss of generality, that ?1 > ?2. Since firms have identical cost\n\nfunctions, we have ????1 = ???\n?\n2 , while according to the Lemma 4, we found that ???\n\n*\n1 &lt;???\n\n*\n2.\n\nUsing this two relations, we find the following inequalities\n\n???*1 ? ???\n?\n1 &lt;???\n\n*\n2 ? ???\n\n?\n2&lt;\n\n1 ? ?2\n1 ? ?1\n\n(???*2 ? ???\n?\n2) ,\n\nand thus, rewriting it we find ?*2 ???2 > ?*1 ???2 , the condition which shows that ??1 > 0.\nThe inequality above holds, since ???*2 ? ????2 is positive if ?1 > ?2. It cannot be negative,\nbecause it could not be the solution for the cooperation problem, as the firm 2 weights is\n\ngreater than firm 1.\n\nTherefore, although firm are identical, by operating under different fiscal regimes\n\ncreates a distortion which one firm can use it strategically to gain more rent from the\n\nunit deal, in the sense that firm 1 will earn more that it is generating for the unit. In\n\nthe next section, we will introduce the role of the regulator, following the Brazilian legal\n\nframework. He will be responsible to propose a deal whenever firms can\u2019t reach one. We\n\nwill study how it affects the bargaining position and how firm use it strategically to gain\n\nmore rent from the unit.\n\n\n\n85\n\n3.6.2 Regulator resolution\n\nAccording to the Brazilian legal framework, during a unitization process firms will have a\n\nperiod to negotiate and try to reach an agreement, however after a deadline, the regulator\n\nwill propose an agreement. This agent takes into account the government role and the\n\nfirms\u2019 role. The government is interested in collecting revenue to finance his policies,\n\nrevenue that is based on profit share and royalties from the firms. According to our\n\nmodel, the government utility is given by\n\n?(?) =\n??\n?\n\n?? [????(?) ? ???] + ? (?1 + ?2) (3.12)\n\nso the government has two revenue sources: (i) profit share from the PSA; (ii) and royal-\n\nties. The profit share is aligned with firms\u2019 goal, which is to maximize their profit, however\n\nthe royalty adds an extra burden to the firms. In some cases, the government would pre-\n\nfer firms to operate above the optimal production level in order to collect royalties and\n\nincrease its utility.\n\nThe regulator role in this model is to consider both firms objective and government\n\nobjective. A simple way to model it is by assigning weights for firms\u2019 profit and govern-\n\nment\u2019s revenue, which we denote ? ? [0,1], where ? > 1/2 means that the regulator cares\nmore about revenues than profits, and otherwise for ? &lt;1/2. Therefore, when ? = 0,\n\nmeans that regulator just care about firms\u2019 profits, or firms\u2019 efficiency, by not considering\n\nthe government\u2019s revenue. On the opposite way, for ? = 1, the regulator is totally aligned\n\nto the government and thus it only worry about revenues. The regulator will be impar-\n\ntial when ? = 1/2, since it assigns the same weight for firms\u2019 profits and government\u2019s\n\nrevenues. Hence, we can write the regulator utility as\n\n?(?) = ??(?) + (1 ? ?)?(?). (3.13)\n\nWe can rewrite it as a weighted average of firms profit and the royalty term, using the\n\nweight denoted by ?? = ??? + (1 ? ?)(1 ? ??), in which the first term is related to the\ngovernment take given the regulator weight for it, while the second term is referred to the\n\nfirms\u2019 profits. The regulator utility is now given by\n\n?(?) =\n??\n?\n\n?? [????(?) ? ???] + ?? (?1 + ?2) . (3.14)\n\nFirst note that when ? = 1/2, we have ?? = 1/2 and then the solution for the\n\nmaximization of ?(?) would be the same as efficient solution, where firms operate under\n\nno regime, i.e. ?? = 0 and ? = 0. Also, in this equation we can see the efficiency trade-\n\n\n\n86\n\noff the regulator face, similarly to the government, in which increasing the production\n\ngenerates more utility to the regulator through higher level of government take. It is clear\n\nthat when the regulator only carries about the firms, it would find the same solution as\n\nthe cooperation\u2019s problem. However, increasing the importance of the government, higher\n\nlevel of production can generates more government\u2019s take, yielding higher benefit for the\n\nregulator. The first order condition for this problem implies\n\n?????(?\n?\n1 ,?\n\n?\n2 )\n\n???\n= (1 ? 2?)\n\n1 ? ??\n??\n\n? +\n??\n??\n???? . (3.15)\n\nWhen ? = 1/2, this equation would be equal to ???? , which is the same condition\n\nfor the efficient production, where firms cooperate and do not take into account the fiscal\n\nregime. Note that when ? = 0, we have the same first order condition as the cooperation\n\nproblem. The first term related to the royalties is decreasing in ?, so the highest value\n\nit assume is 1, the same as in the cooperation problem. As the regulator increases the\n\nimportance of the government revenue, this term decreases indicating he would be willing\n\nto increase the production, when we consider only the effect of the royalties. The second\n\nterm is related to the externality and the fiscal regimes. If ? = 0 or firms are in the same\n\nregime, this term is equal to the term in the cooperation first order condition. However,\n\nsuppose ?2 > ?1, that is, firm 2 share a larger portion of its profit with the government,\n\nthe fraction ?2/?1 will be greater than (1 ? ?2)/(1 ? ?1) and increasing in ?. Thus, the\noptimal production level for firm 1 will be reduced compare to the cooperative solution,\n\nand this reduction will be amplified as ? increases. On the other hand, firm 2 will increase\n\nits production.\n\nNow, the firm that will produce the most will be determined by the regulator align-\n\nment ? and the fiscal regime ??, which is shown in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 13 A firm will produce more than the other if, and only if, it shares lower\n\nportion of its profit with the government and the regulator is more aligned with the firms,\n\ni.e. ??1 > ?\n?\n2 if, and only if ?2 > ?1 and ? &lt;1/2.\n\nProof. We can check that by subtracting the first order condition for ?1 and ?2, and\n\nanalyzing the following equality\n\n? ? ??? ? 2???1 =\n?2\n?1\n\n(?\n? ? ??? ? 2???2\n\n)?\n, (3.16)\n\nas before, but now we are comparing ?1 and ?2. If ? &lt;1/2 and ?2 > ?1, then ?1 > ?2,\n\nand thus ??1 > ?\n?\n2 .\n\nAccording to Equation (3.14), we saw that ?? is the weight for firm ? in the weighted\n\naverage that represented the regulator utility. Under the condition above, we know that\n\n\n\n87\n\nfirm 1 will produce more and it will have greater weight than firm 2, so we can expect\n\nthat firm 1 will generate greater profit level than firm 2, if the royalties are equal to zero.\n\nProposition 14 Suppose there are no royalties, that is, ? = 0. A firm will have larger\n\nprofit under the regulator solution if, and only if, it shares lower portion of its profit with\n\nthe government and the regulator is more aligned with the firms, i.e. ??1 > ?\n?\n2 if, and\n\nonly if ?2 > ?1 and ? &lt;1/2.\n\nProof. We can check that using the same idea used before for the cooperation problem.\n\nMore specifically, we can prove that at the interior solution for the regulator problem,\n\n???1(?\n?) > ???2(?\n\n?) if, and only if, ? &lt;1/2 and ?2 > ?1. In order to check that, we can\n\ncompare the first order solution, when ? = 0, in which\n\n????1(?\n?\n1 ,?\n\n?\n2 )\n\n??1\n=\n\n?2\n?1\n???2 > ??\n\n?\n2 > ??\n\n?\n1 >\n\n?1\n?2\n???1 =\n\n????2(?\n?\n1 ,?\n\n?\n2 )\n\n??2\n, (3.17)\n\nand again, using the concavity of ??? we have ??1 > ?\n?\n2 .\n\nThis proof can fail if ? > 0 is sufficiently high, because we would not use the fact\n\nthat the partial derivative with respect to ?? is positive, which certifies us that the solution\n\nis at the increasing part of the profit function. Note that here, the regulator are increasing\n\nthe production of the firm have greater ??, which is the firm ? weight in the regulator\n\nutility. In addition, since the first order condition implies that the production level is at\n\nthe increasing part of the profit function, when ? = 0, that we can say that by increasing\n\nthe quantity of firm ?, the regulator is increasing its profit level.\n\nNumerical analysis\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot use the same idea to prove that ?1(?\n?) > ?2(?\n\n?), because ?\n\ncan invert the inequality sign, and it does not allow us to prove the converse of the\n\nstatement. In order to provide insights for this problem, we solved this regulator problem\n\nnumerically and it is possible to identify parameter regions in which the profit of one firm\n\nwill be greater than the other.\n\nAn illustration of this solution is plotted in the Figure 3.3 below. This figures are\n\nthe contour plot of the difference of firm 1 profit relative to firm 2, i.e. ?1(?\n?) ? ?2(??)\n\nwhen ?2 = 0.4. The lighter color means that ?1(?\n?) > ?2(?\n\n?), and on the other hand,\n\nthe darker color means ?1(?\n?) &lt;?2(?\n\n?). In the plot on the left, it was assumed ? = 3,\n\nwhile in the plot on the right, it was assumed ? = 2. As we can see, the upper right and\n\nthe lower left corners of the figure are the regions of (?1,?) implies greater profit level for\n\nfirm 1 than firm 2. The vertical line at ?1 = 0.4 clear represents a condition to identify\n\nwho earns more profit. However, the ? will be a function of the parameters of the model,\n\n\n\n88\n\nFigure 3.3: ?1(?\n?) ? ?2(??) when ?2 = 0.4, for ? = 3 and ? = 2, respectively.\n\nlike the regimes, cost and externality level, as we can see by comparing both of the plots.\n\nIn summary, we can argue that the firm that share less profit will generate more profit\n\nrelative to the other firm, when the regulator is sufficiently aligned with the firms, that\n\nis, worries more about the profit of the firm than the government revenue.\n\nReturning to the bargaining problem, when firms use the solution of the regulator\n\nto threat as an alternative for the bargaining problem. Using the Equation (3.6) and the\n\nnumerical solution explained above, we can say that firm 1 will have greater share than\n\nfirm 2, i.e. ?? > 1/2, if the firms profit share portion is less than firm 2 share and the\n\nregulator worries more about firms profit, or when firm 1 shares more of its profits and\n\nthe regulator gives more importance for government revenue.\n\nEven though firm 1 receives a larger portion of the joint profit under the condition\n\nmentioned above, the transfer that a firm will make to the other does not depend on ?,\n\naccording to the numerical exercise. Interestingly, the transfer appears to depend only on\n\nthe fiscal regime, and the transfer will be positive for the firm that shares larger portion\n\nof its profit to the government, that is, firm 1 will receive a transfer if ?1 > ?2. The\n\nillustration of this solution is in the Figure 3.4, where we show a contour plot of the firm\n\n1 transfer, and the lighter color means ??1 > 0 and the darker color means firm 1 pays\n\ntransfer to firm 2. We assumed again that ?2 = 0.4. Note that the transfer do not depend\n\non the regulator parameter ?, but only on the fiscal regime. Hence, as in the rule of\n\ncapture situation, the firm that will be benefited is the one that shares a larger portion\n\nof its profit to the government.\n\n\n\n89\n\nFigure 3.4: ??1 contour plot\n\n3.6.3 Comparing the solutions by numerical analysis\n\nAnother question we explore here is whether the existence of the regulator increases or\n\ndecreases the transfer needed to reach an agreement. To address this case, we will compare\n\nthe transfer when players are imposed the regulator deal, where the transfer is denote by\n\n??? , with the case when players extract oil based on the rule of capture. Let ?\n?\n? be the\n\ntransfer when the threat point is given by the Nash equilibrium. The answer to this\n\nquestion can be found by subtracting the absolute value of the transfer in each situation,\n\nand if both values are positive, we have\n\n??? ? ?\n?\n? =\n\n??? ? ???\n2\n\n?\n??? ? ???\n\n2\n?? ?? ? ??? =\n\n??? ? ???\n2\n\n?\n??? ? ???\n\n2\n, (3.18)\n\nhence, all we need is to compare the threat points if the firm receiving the transfer is the\n\nsame. Looking at this equations, the transfer under the regulator setting would be larger\n\nthan under the rule of capture if, and only if ??? ???? > ??? ???? , that is, the firm receiving\nthe transfer will have larger transfer whenever difference of the profit under the regulator\n\nchoice is larger than under rule of capture. The larger is the difference between players\n\nprofit in each threat point situation, the larger will be the transfer needed to reach an\n\nagreement. The transfer occurs due to the fiscal regime players are operating, and not\n\nby their production and cost function, since we assumed they are identical. Therefore,\n\nthe role of the regulator should be the one to minimize the misallocation of the rents,\n\nreducing the transfer between players.\n\nSo far, we identified the player who will be benefited in the unitization, when op-\n\nerating in a dual fiscal regime, whether firms threat according to the rule of capture or\n\naccording to the regulator solution. Nevertheless, an important question now is whether\n\nthe regulator are able to reduce the distortion caused by the dual fiscal regime. We should\n\n\n\n90\n\nexpected that the role of the regulator in an economy to be such that reduce the distortion\n\ncaused by a previous policy.\n\nIn order to check whether the regulator is reducing the distortion, we can use the\n\nEquation (3.18). Note that according to the equation, the distortion will be lower when\n\nthe difference in the profit evaluated at the threat point solution is lower. The Figure\n\n3.5 below illustrates that the distortion is increasing with respect to ?, that is, the more\n\nimportance the regulator gives to the government\u2019s revenue, the more distortion it will\n\ngenerate, and higher will be the transfer. However, the transfer will be lower than the\n\ntransfer using the rule of capture as a threat point, as long as the regulator is impartial\n\nbetween government revenue and firms profit, that is, when ? = 1/2. If the regulator\n\nworries more about government\u2019s take, than the distortion in the economy will be higher,\n\nthe transfer needed to reach an agreement will be larger.\n\nFigure 3.5: Transfer comparison\n\nOn the horizontal axis of this plot is all possible alignment between the regulator\n\nand government, and on the vertical axis is the transfer that firm 1 receives. We assume\n\nthat ?1 > ?2. The blue line in this figure represents the transfer when firms threat\n\naccording to the rule of capture, while the orange line represents the transfer when firms\n\nthreat according to the regulator proposal. As we can see, the transfer associated to the\n\nregulator\u2019s problem will be lower if ? &lt;1/2.\n\n3.7 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we studied the effects of the dual fiscal regime over the unitization ne-\n\ngotiation. The new regulatory framework for the pre-salt areas in Brazil introduced the\n\nproduction sharing agreement to lease the oil field for exploration and development. How-\n\never, the concession contracts will co-exist in different areas, but some of them might be\n\ncontiguous to the pre-salt area. Thus, the study proposed here shed a light about the\n\ndistortion the dual regime will impose to the firms and how firms will strategically use\n\nthe regulator as a threat to be benefited in the negotiation.\n\n\n\n91\n\nOur paper modeled the negotiation of the unitization agreement as a bargaining\n\nproblem and solved it using the axiomatic solution proposed by Nash (1950). We showed\n\nthat even if the firms are identical, but operating under different fiscal regime, one of the\n\nfirm will be benefited. This benefit is associated to a larger share that a firm receives than\n\nthe profit that the firm are helping to generate. This finding holds for the two possible\n\nresolution considered here, that is, two possible scenarios if the negotiation breaks-down.\n\nThe rule of capture was used as a benchmark, where firms compete for the resource\n\nsuffering from the common-pool problem, while the other one is the regulator proposal\n\naccording to the Brazilian law. We also showed that the regulator could reduce this\n\ndistortion as long as he is impartial between government take and firms profit or it is\n\nmore worried about firms profit than government revenue.\n\nFinally, the future steps of this research should consider finding analytically the\n\nregions that defines the player benefited by the fiscal regime. It can also study the dynamic\n\nsetting, there price is uncertain and firms operating in different fiscal regime might be\n\ninterested in producing in a different timing to reduce the risks. In the concession, firms\n\nare able to choose how fast they can produce, while in the PSA, since the firm is a partner\n\nof the regulator, the board might not accept a faster recovery rate.\n\n\n\n92\n\nBibliography\n\nAghion, P. and Quesada, L.
