Calcium \nsalts have different solubilities and depending on the anion to which calcium is associated \nwith, it can be more or less absorbed, modifying the pH of the urine. The aim of this study \nwas to evaluate the efficiency of calcium sources on alkalinization of urinary pH, as well as \nexcretion of urinary electrolytes and acid-base balance of adult cats. An extruded diet for cats \nwas selected, and had 160mEq/kg of calcium from the sources of either calcium carbonate \n(CaCO3) or calcium gluconate (C12H22CaO14) added. In the control treatment there was no \naddition of calcium sources, resulting in three treatments. Nine adult cats were used, mixed \nbreed, in two experimental periods, with six replicates per treatment. Animal average age \nwas 4\u00b11.3 years old and average weight was 3.96\u00b10.71kg. The cats remained in metabolic \ncages for an adaptation period of seven days, followed by six days of urine total collection, \nwith volume, density, pH and calcium concentration (g/d) measurements. The acid-base \nbalance was studied by blood gas analysis of venous blood. The two sources of calcium \nalkalinized the urine (P<0.001). However, calcium gluconate had less alkalinization power \ncompared to the calcium carbonate (P<0.05). Urinary calcium was not affected by treatments, \nand represented less than 0.5% of calcium intake. The experiment showed that calcium, \nalthough an alkaline cation and considered strong influencer of the EB of the diet, cannot \nbe evaluated individually, because depending on its associated anion it may have greater or \nlesser influence on cats urine pH.\nINDEX TERMS: Calcium, diets, cats, urinary parameters, acid-base balance, base excess, calcium \ncarbonate, calcium gluconate, urinary calcium, urolithiasis, clinics.\n\nPVB-5796 SA\n\nEffect of calcium sources in the diets of adult cats on \nurinary parameters and acid-base balance1\n\nD\u00f3ris P.

BE can alter urinary pH (Allen &amp; Kruger 2000), \nand changes in urine pH are, in fact, due to the impact of \nthe cations and anions balance on the acid-base state of the \nanimals (Pizzorno et al. 2010).\n\nUrolithiasis in dogs and cats has been much studied in \nrecent years and management of this disorder is evolving, \nwith nutrition being a keystone for the management of \nthese animals (Jeremias et al. 2013, Lulich et al. 2016), since \ndiet influences urinary pH, and it has a strong influence on \ncertain types of urolith formation (Bartges &amp; Callens 2015, \nBartges 2016).\n\nThe cations that most influence urinary pH are calcium \n(Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na) and potassium (K), and \nthe anions are phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and chlorine (Cl) \n(Block 1984). Thus, calcium is part of the mineral composition \nof the diet and is considered a cation of strong alkalizing \npower, increasing urinary pH by altering BE (Dibartola 2006). \nCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) is considered a strong dietary \nalkali (Kienzle et al. 1991), however other chemical forms of \ncalcium, such as calcium sulfate, present cation-anion balance \nclose to zero and may have lower effects on the acid-base \nstatus of animals.\n\nKienzle et al. (1991) and Pastoor et al. (1994a) obtained \ndiscrepant results regarding the action of calcium as a urinary \nalkalinizer. They observed that the addition of CaCO3 raised \nurinary pH, unlike calcium chloride (CaCl2), which acidified the \npH. The acidifying effect of calcium chloride is due to the fact \nthat calcium is less absorbed than chloride and urinary chloride \n\nexcretion decreases the excretion of bicarbonate and increases \nammonium, acidifying the urinary pH (Pastoor et al. 1994a).\n\nThus, considering that the effect of calcium on urinary pH \nis apparently influenced by the composition of calcium salts, \nand based on the need for new approaches and adequate \ninformation on the storage potential of each mineral source \nto make the right decision during cat food formulation, the \npresent study evaluated the efficiency of two calcium sources \non alkalinization of urinary pH, as well as excretion of urinary \nelectrolytes and acid-base balance of adult cats.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nEthics statement. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory \n\nof Research on Nutrition and Nutritional Diseases of Dogs and Cats, \nS\u00e3o Paulo State University, Jaboticabal, Brazil, in compliance with \nprocedures approved by the Ethics Research Committee for Animal \nWelfare of the College of Agrarian and Veterinary Sciences, S\u00e3o Paulo \nState University (protocol number 017648/11).\n\nAnimals and experimental design. Eighteen healthy adult \nmixed-breed cats aged 5\u00b11.4 years and with 3.96\u00b10.71kg of body \nweight. The experiment was conducted with 2 groups and each group \nof 9 cats received three diets in a randomized complete block design \n(3 cats/diet in each group), resulting in 6 cats/diet. The blocking \nfactors were body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS) and age. \nAbout 3.21g Ca/kg (+160mEq/kg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) \nor calcium gluconate (C12H22CaO14) were added to a dry diet for \ncats with BE around -140mEq/kg. In the control diet, no calcium \nsource was added. All diets were pelleted and their nutritional level \nwas similar (Table 1), all being within recommendations for adult \ncat maintenance (AAFCO 2008). Calcium sources were added by \nreplacing corn starch.\n\nCats belonged to the same laboratory colony, and their health \nwas assessed prior to the beginning of the survey by clinical and \nhematologic examination, as well as by urine analysis. The animals \nwere kept in individual stainless steel metabolic cages (90x80x90cm) \nequipped with a system to separate faeces and urine. Cats were fed \nonce daily (8h00) and the metabolizable energy (ME) of diets was \ncalculated from their chemical composition. The amount of food \nsupplied was calculated as 130kcal ME per kg0.4 (NRC 2006). Water \nwas provided ad libitum, and food was offered ad libitum until the \nnext meal. Food intake was daily measured by weighing offered \nfood and refusal amounts.\n\nUrine analysis. Diet adaptation occurred from days 1 to 7, and \nthe following 6 days were used for total urine collection, in two \nperiods. In the first period (days 8-10), urine was collected twice \ndaily in plastic containers with 0.1g of thymol (0.1g per 100mL of \nurine) and kept refrigerated (4\u00b0C). Immediately after collection, urine \nvolume was measured, as well as urine density with a refractometer \n(model T2-N3, ATAGO CO., LTD, Tokyo, Japan), and pH with a pH meter \n(model DM20, DIGIMED, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil). The urine collected in 24h \nwas maintained frozen. The urine produced in 72h was mixed and \nevaluated for sodium (mmol/L) and potassium (mmol/L) using an \nion-selective method (AVL unit - OMNI4, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) \ndetermined by mercuric thiocyanate methodology (Labtest, Minas \nGerais, Brazil) followed by spectrophotometry.\n\nIn the second period (days 11-13), urine was collected twice \ndaily in plastic containers with HCl 6N (2mL per 100mL of urine) \nand kept refrigerated (4\u00b0C). This measure has been reported to \nreduce the urinary pH to about 1-2, preventing the formation of \ncrystals (Griyth &amp; Dunn (1978). Calcium (mg/dL), phosphorus \n(mg/dL), magnesium (mg/dL) and sulfur (g/L) were measured in \n\n\n\n2135\n\nPesq. Vet.

Calcium quantification was analyzed using \ncolorimetric method (CPC - cresolphthalein, calcium Liquiform, \nMinas Gerais, Brazil), and magnesium by the colorimetric method \n(Magon sulfonate, magnesium Liquiform, Minas Gerais, Brazil).\n\nFaecal score. Faecal score was always determined by the same \nresearcher, according to a scale from 1 to 5, as follows: 1 = watery \n(liquid, can be poured from a container); 2 = soft, unshaped stool \n(assumes the shape of the container); 3 = soft, shaped, and moist \nstool; 4 = firm, shaped, dry stool (remains firm and soft); 5 = hard, \ndry pellets (small, hard masses) (De-Oliveira et al. 2008).\n\nBlood gas analysis. After 13d of diet consumption, 0.5mL of \nvenous blood was collected from the medial saphenous vein without \ncompression, at 08:00 am (before feeding) and 02:00 pm (six hours \nafter feeding). Before blood was collected, the syringe was washed \nout with a heparin solution, leaving the dead-space filled. Blood was \nimmediately analyzed for pH, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, \npartial pressure of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, base excess and \nosmolality using Omini C Blood Gas Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, \nIndianapolis, USA).\n\nChemical analysis. Diet samples were analyzed for dry matter \n(DM), crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), mineral matter (MM) and \nacid-hydrolyzed fat (AHF) according to AOAC (2006). The samples \nwere ground in a cutting mill equipped with 1mm screen and analyzed \nfor DM by submitting samples to oven drying; ash by muffle furnace \nincineration; and crude protein CP using the Kjeldahl method. \nSamples were also analyzed for AHF using Soxhlet apparatus, and \nCF using the Weende method (AOAC 2006). Nitrogen-free extract \n(NFE) was calculated by subtracting ash, AHF, CP and CF components \nfrom DM (NFE = DM-ash-AHF-CP-CF). Minerals were analyzed after \nnitric-perchloric digestion. Phosphorus was measured with the \n\nspectrophotometer using the vanadate-molybdate method. Calcium, \npotassium, magnesium, chloride, and sodium were measured by \nflame atomic absorption spectrophotometry.\n\nStatistical analysis. Data were analyzed by the statistical software \nSAS (version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA), in a randomised \nblock design by ANOVA, three treatments in two blocks, and the \naverages of treatments were compared by the SNK test. All analyses \nwere performed using GLM module from the Statigraphics plus \n4.1 software. Values of p?0.05 were considered significant.\n\nRESULTS\nCats showed average daily food intake of 14.7\u00b11.5g/kg DM/ BW/d, \nwhich is considered satisfactory and did not differ among \ngroups. The group fed with added calcium gluconate diet \nhad lower faecal score (P=0.050) and faecal dry matter \n(P=0.003), and higher venous Na+ (P=0.049) and osmolality \n(P=0.008; Table 2).\n\nDaily urinary volume and urine density were not significantly \ndifferent. Cats fed with diets with added calcium showed \nincreased urine pH and the addition of calcium carbonate \nin the diet showed greater effect than calcium gluconate on \npH, (P<0.001; Table 3).\n\nCats fed with control diet had increased Na+ excretion \n(P=0.018). The group fed with calcium carbonate diet had \nlower percentage of urinary phosphorus excretion (P=0.044). \nThe addition of calcium in either form did not result in increased \nexcretion of phosphorus in urine (P=0.233; Table 3).\n\nThe correlation between urinary pH and Na+ excretion was \nnegative (R2=-0.49, P<0.05). Ca2+ excretion was correlated only \nwith the Mg2+ excretion (R2=0.49, P<0.05). Chloride excretion \n(R2=0.79, P<0.001) was highly correlated with K+ excretion, \nas well as K+ to Na+ (R2=0.47, P<0.05; Table 4).\n\nDISCUSSION\nCats fed with diet containing calcium gluconate had lower \nfaecal score (P=0.050) compared to cats that received control \ndiet and diet with added calcium carbonate, which indicates \nproduction of faeces with higher moisture content (Table 2). \nSince there was no difference in urinary volume between \ngroups, the possible explanation for higher water loss in the \nstool could be the increased osmolality by osmotic active \nglucose from gluconate. Blood gas analysis showed slight \nmetabolic acidosis in control and calcium gluconate treatments, \nwith pH, HCO3 and BE below normal values (Dibartola 2006), \nprobably due to low BE of the control diet. However, deviations \nfrom normality were minimal and did not differ from calcium \ncarbonate values. Ionized calcium was found below normal \nblood gas parameters for adult cats in all experimental diets, \nbefore and after feeding (Table 2). Hypocalcemia found in \nthis study (reference values of iCa: 1.15 to 1.35; Dibartola \n2006), may be explained by the use of heparin in the syringe \nfor blood collection.\n\nNa+ and osmolality values were higher (P<0.05) in the \ntreatment with calcium gluconate. Hypernatremia could \nhave occurred by the presence of impermeable solutes such \nas glucose. Initially, the elevation of blood glucose draws \nintracellular water to the extracellular fluid in order to \nnormalise osmolality, with consequent dilution of sodium \nand hyponatremia. Subsequently, there may be development \nof hypernatremia due to osmotic diuresis, which occurs as a \n\nTable 1.

Cats fed \nwith the diet containing calcium carbonate showed higher \nurinary pH than cats fed with the diet with added calcium \ngluconate (P<0.001), although both groups had ingested \nsimilar amounts of calcium.\n\nCats that received the diet with calcium gluconate possibly \nabsorbed more Ca2+, but still there was no greater urinary \nCa2+ excretion. Urine pH was more acidic than in cats fed the \ndiet containing calcium carbonate. Diet containing calcium \ncarbonate may have had less Ca2+ absorption, but induced higher \nurine alkalinization. This difference in the urine alkalization \nlevels is similar to that observed between calcium chloride \nand calcium carbonate reported by Pastoor et al. (1994a). \nThe authors observed that urine pH was always lower when \ncalcium chloride was added to the diet, while the addition of \ncalcium carbonate increased the urine pH. Kienzle et al. (1991) \nobserved that the addition of calcium carbonate and calcium \nlactate (C6H10CaO6) increased urine pH, and calcium chloride \nacidified urine pH.\n\nAlthough calcium is absorbed by the intestinal tract, not \nall is retained in tissues. About 90% of daily Ca2+ intake is \nexcreted in faeces, while the remaining is eliminated in urine \n(Guyton &amp; Hall 1996). Despite being a high-power alkalinizing \ncation, its absorption is dependent on the associated anion, \nbeing more or less absorbed (Allen &amp; Kruger 2000). Renal \ncalcium excretion levels in healthy cats are low and seem to \nnot be strictly correlated with dietary calcium intake (Zentek \n&amp; Schulz 2004).\n\nPansu et al. (1993) studied the solubility and intestinal \ntransit time limit of calcium absorption in rats. According to \nthem, calcium carbonate has low solubility, and is preferably \nabsorbed via transcellular in the proximal parts of the intestine, \nwhen it becomes slightly soluble in higher pH. Salts with \ngreater solubility such as calcium gluconate will be soluble at \nhigher pH values, which may be absorbed on other portions \nof the intestine, on calcium paracellular pathway, since it is \nconsidered non-saturable.\n\nPasslack &amp; Zentek (2013) investigated the impact of \ndietary calcium and phosphorus on urine composition of \ncats and demonstrated that increasing dietary calcium and \nphosphorus did not affect urinary mineral concentrations \nand had more influence on PTH levels. An increase in faecal \ncalcium was observed, showing that the homeostatic regulatory \nprocess of calcium metabolism in cats seems to be related \nto the intestinal tract and not to renal excretion. Moreover, \nPTH enhances blood calcium concentration by increasing \nintestinal calcium absorption, reducing the renal calcium \nexcretion (Healy et al. 2003).\n\nJeremias et al. (2013) observed that equations predicting \nbase excess of foods tended to overestimate urine pH and \naccording to the study, they could have some limitations. \nIt is possible that not the entire acid load produced in the \nintermediary metabolism is related to food macroelements, \nbecause differences in absorption of certain acid and alkaline \nminerals are not taken into account.\n\nKienzle &amp; Wilms-Eilers (1994) tested diets with ammonium \nchloride (NH4Cl) and observed that it suppresses postprandial \nalkaline tide when combined with calcium carbonate, but \nthis effect can be reversed when it is associated with sodium \ncarbonate (Na2CO3). Calcium carbonate is not readily soluble \nand therefore, it is absorbed more slowly while sodium \ncarbonate is rapidly absorbed, contributing to the postprandial \nalkaline tide.\n\nLower urinary calcium excretion was also reported by \nPastoor et al. (1994a), who evaluated the balance of daily Ca2+ \nin cats fed with a diet high in Ca2+ (13g/kg). The percentage \nexcreted in urine was approximately 0.59% of Ca2+ consumed \nand faecal percentage was around 98% of Ca2+ consumed, \nsimilar to findings in the present experiment, which found \neven lower urinary calcium excretion levels.\n\nIn the calcium carbonate metabolism in human patients, \nCa2+ was minimally excreted in the urine, while carbonate \ncontributes to the increased potential of bicarbonate buffer, \ndemonstrating that carbonate is most likely responsible for \nurine alkalization (Clarkson et al. 1970).\n\nIn this study, urinary K+ and Ca2+ excretions were similar \nto concentrations reported by Lulich et al. (2004). However, \nNa+, Mg2+ and P excretions were higher in this experiment \n(Table 3), which may be related to the different amount of \nmacrominerals in the diets.\n\nIn the control diet, high Na+ and phosphorus excretions \nwere observed and pH was negatively correlated with Na+ \n(R2=-0.49, P<0.05; Table 4). This can be explained by the \nacid-base balance, which in an attempt to compensate for \nthe metabolic acidosis, increases the excretion of H+ ions, \nwhich are buffered by HPO4, forming H2PO4, which may be \nexcreted as sodium salt (NaH2PO4). Phosphorus excretion \nin the treatment with calcium gluconate was significantly \nhigher than in the treatment with calcium carbonate, which \ncan also be explained by the buffering of HPO4.\n\nAccording to Pastoor et al. (1994b), increased Ca2+ \nintake decreased phosphorus and Mg2+ absorption due to \nthe formation of insoluble calcium-magnesium-phosphate \ncomplexes (Brink et al. 1992). In this study, there was no \ndifference in urinary Mg2+ excretion, but there was lower \nphosphorus excretion in cats fed with the diet containing \ncalcium carbonate. This may have occurred because calcium \ncarbonate, due to its lower absorption or reexcretion into \nthe intestinal lumen, may have had more time to react with \nphosphorus, generating complexes, which possibly could have \nincreased its faecal excretion, concomitantly decreasing its \nurinary excretion. Calcium gluconate, due to its higher and \n\nTable 4.

(2011) demonstrated that high water \nintake influences urinary evaluations in cats by increasing the \nurine volume, reducing the urine density. The amount of water \ningested by cats was not measured in this study. However, no \nsignificant differences among evaluations mentioned above \nwere observed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe experiment demonstrated that calcium carbonate \n\nand gluconate of calcium alkalinized the urine. Calcium \ncarbonate has highest potential than calcium gluconate, which \ndemonstrates that carbonate also contributes to alkalinization, \nand this action is not exclusive to calcium.\n\nThe calcium ion should not be evaluated in isolation, since \nits presence in urine affects the urinary pH variably according \nto the anion forming the different Ca salts.\n\nConflict of interest statement.- The authors have no competing interests.\n\nAcknowledgements.- The authors are grateful to Mogiana Alimentos Ltda \n(Guabi), for the financial, technical support, and to CAPES foundation for \nthe author supported.\n\nREFERENCES\nAAFCO 2008.
