DOUTOR CARLOS MANUEL COSTA BASTARDO \n\n \n\n \n \n\nOCTOBER - 2015\n\n\n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nTitular de uma posi\u00e7\u00e3o preponderante no sector petrol\u00edfero, a Sonangol E.P. (designada daqui \n\npara frente como \u201cSonangol\u201d ou \u201cGrupo\u201d) \u00e9 a maior empresa p\u00fablica a operar em Angola e \n\numas das maiores a operar em \u00c1frica. Esta, det\u00e9m uma linha de neg\u00f3cios que integra toda a \n\ncadeia de valor referente ao neg\u00f3cio petrol\u00edfero, nomeadamente, desde a extrac\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npetr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s natural, at\u00e9 a sua transforma\u00e7\u00e3o, distribui\u00e7\u00e3o e venda ao consumidor final.  \n\nCom uma carteira de investimentos muito diversificada, o Grupo possui interesses e \n\ninvestimentos em outros sectores de actividade, que colocam a empresa no topo das maiores \n\nem termos de receitas e activos em \u00c1frica.  \n\nContudo, sendo o principal ve\u00edculo de desenvolvimento econ\u00f3mico-financeiro em Angola, \n\nfruto dos avultados investimentos que realiza tanto no mercado dom\u00e9stico como no \n\ninternacional, a Sonangol E.P. depara-se com in\u00fameros desafios futuros consequentes da \n\nactual conjuntura macroecon\u00f3mica vivida no Pa\u00eds bem como a recente queda dos pre\u00e7os do \n\npetr\u00f3leo.  \n\nAssim, este Trabalho Final de Mestrado tem como objetivo avaliar a Sonangol E.P. e \n\ndeterminar o valor intr\u00ednseco das suas ac\u00e7\u00f5es, atrav\u00e9s de um processo exaustivo de an\u00e1lise do \n\nGrupo, da ind\u00fastria e das previs\u00f5es de crescimento. A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o foi realizada pelo m\u00e9todo do \n\nFree Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) que de acordo com a revis\u00e3o de literatura abordada \n\npretende conciliar a teoria e pr\u00e1tica de modo a se apurar o valor intr\u00ednseco das ac\u00e7\u00f5es da \n\nempresa. Como resultado desta avalia\u00e7\u00e3o, foi poss\u00edvel concluir que a Sonangol det\u00e9m um \n\nvalor empresarial (enterprise value) de aproximadamente 15 mil milh\u00f5es de euros, estando o \n\nvalor intr\u00ednseco de cada ac\u00e7\u00e3o a rondar os 9.23 euros.  \n\nPara finalizar, este trabalho providencia uma base s\u00f3lida de an\u00e1lise para uma poss\u00edvel venda \n\nparcial ou total da empresa pelo estado Angolano, assim como para o lan\u00e7amento de um \n\nposs\u00edvel IPO (initial public offer).  \n\nPalavras-chave: Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de Empresas, Free Cash-Flow to Firm, Enterprise Value, \n\nPetr\u00f3leo, Angola, \u00c1frica, IPO. \n\n\n\n \n\nII \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nWith a Key position in the sector of Energies, Sonangol E.P. (hereinafter \u201cSonangol\u201d or \n\n\u201cGroup\u201d) is the largest state-run oil company operating in Angola, the Africa\u2019s second-largest \n\ncrude producer. Holder of a business line that integrates the entire value chain of oil &amp; gas \n\nbusiness, since its extraction to its distribution and sale to the final costumer, Sonangol holds \n\ninvestments and interests in other sectors (transportation, real estate, education, healthcare, \n\netc) which places the company on top of the largest firms in terms of assets and revenues \n\noperating in Angola. However, as the main driving force of the Angolan economy, Sonangol \n\npresents large future challenges due to the current macroeconomic situation lived in the \n\ncountry as well as the actual fall in oil prices. \n\nThis Master\u2019s Final Work aims to determine the underlying enterprise value of Sonangol, \n\nthrough a thorough analysis of the Group and the industry as well as its growth prospects. \n\nThe valuation was based on Free Cash Flow to the Firm methodology, which according to \n\nthe established in the literature review, conciliate the theory and practice to reach the real \n\nvalue of Sonangol\u2019s share price. \n\nWith this evaluation it was possible to conclude that Sonangol\u2019s enterprise value is EUR \n\n15.566bn, being the intrinsic value of each share EUR 9.23. \n\nTherefore this study provides a solid basis of analysis, for possible sale of the company by \n\nthe Angolan state, as well as turning the Group public through an IPO process (Initial Public \n\nOffer). \n\n \n\nKeywords: Equity Valuation; Free Cash Flow To The Firm; Enterprise Value; Energy \n\nSector; Angola; Sonangol E.P. \n\n\n\n \n\nIII \n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThe completion of this undertaking could not have been possible without the participation \n\nand assistance of so many people whose names may not all be enumerated. Their \n\ncontributions are sincerely appreciated and gratefully acknowledged. \n\nHowever, my first and foremost \u201cthank you!\u201d goes to my thesis advisor Professor Carlos \n\nBastardo. Throughout this project he has been a source of inspiration and a provider of \n\nencouragement and insightful comments since the very beginning of this project.  \n\nI am also indebted to Dr. Ana Serrano, Head of Investment Banking Department at Standard \n\nBank Angola for suggesting this theme and provide many valuable comments.

INTRODUCITON \n\nThe recent drop in oil prices was reflected in the deterioration of the main economies \n\ndependent on exports of this commodity. Angola, the second largest oil producer in Africa \n\nand holder of a very dependent economy on exports of oil was no exception. Therefore, \n\nSonangol the national company that manages the hydrocarbon resource exploration in Angola \n\nwhose operational and strategic performance in the past has been outstanding, presents now \n\na lot of obstacles. \n\nThe aim of this project is to evaluate Sonangol and determine the intrinsic value of its shares, \n\nwith the aim of proposing a possible sale of the company by the Angolan government. The \n\ndissertation structure addresses the most relevant issues and a common analysis of equity \n\nresearch analysis, providing all the information available and necessary for an accurate and \n\nplausible result. \n\nFirstly will be conducted the literature review, where it will systematize the main studies and \n\npublications relating to methods of business valuation, the advantages that underlie each \n\nmethod, as well as their applicability. \n\nAdditionally, will be developed a detailed analysis of Sonangol E.P., in order to know its \n\nhistory, as well as its strategy, its portfolio and evolution of its operational performance. \n\nAfter that, the macroeconomic and industry outlook will be presented in order to anticipate \n\nthe main trends and prospects of the industry and identify the critical success factors that \n\ncould impact the performance of Sonagol and therefore its intrinsic value. For the industry \n\nanalysis a SWOT and Porter Strengths study will be presented. \n\nAt the end will be developed an economic-financial model based on a Free Cash Flow to the \n\nFirm method (FCFF), which translate the collected information and assumptions in numbers \n\nand, ultimately, the price target of Sonangol. \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n2.1. Brief Overview \n\nValue is the defining dimension of measurement in a market economy. People invest in the \n\nexpectation that when they sell, the value of each investment will have grown by a sufficient \n\namount above its cost to compensate them for the risk they took. Therefore a company \n\nvaluation is the process of determining the current worth / price of an asset or a company. \n\nAccording to Damodaran (2006) the value of any asset is a function of the cash flows \n\ngenerated by that asset, the life of the asset, the expected growth in the cash flow, and the \n\nriskiness associated with them. \n\n \n\nIn the world of corporate finance, understanding the mechanisms of company valuation is an \n\nindispensable requirement because \u201cvaluing the company and its business units helps identify \n\nsources of economic value creation and destruction within the company\u201d (Fern\u00e1ndez 2007)1. \n\nThe valuation of companies is essential in many business contexts, particularly in active \n\nportfolio management and investment analysis (Damodaran 2002) where analysts and \n\ninvestors seek to identify companies whose shares are being traded below their intrinsic value \n\nin the hope of generating capital gains; mergers and acquisitions (Fern\u00e1ndez 2007) identifying \n\nthe maximum price the buyer is willing to pay, as well as the minimum price the seller is \n\nwilling to receive; corporate finance (Goedhart 2005) it enables CEOs to \u201cfocus on long-term \n\nvalue creation confident that their stock\u2019s market price will eventually reflect their efforts\u201d2, \n\nlitigation / bankruptcy proceedings (Jonathan Berk and Peter deMarzo 2013) intending to \n\ncalculate the value of company assets to later proceed to its sale and meet commitments to \n\ncreditors and shareholders. \n\nIn light of different valuation outcomes (Koller, Goedhart, &amp; Wessels, 2005) argue that the \n\nfinal valuation depends on the subjectivity of the assumptions considered, as well as, the way \n\nthat expectations are managed by the analyst/investor making all valuations biased \n\n                                                           \n1 Fern\u00e1ndez, P. (2007), Company Valuation Methods. The Most Common Errors in Valuations, IESE Business School \n2 Goedhart, M., Koller, T.

Discounted Cash Flows \u2013 DCF  \n\nDiscounted Cash Flow Valuation is a method that estimates the value of any asset by \n\ndiscounting back the expected cash flows on that asset at a rate that reflects their riskiness \n\n(Damodaran 2006). As mentioned by the author an evaluation process measures the intrinsic \n\nvalue of an asset and the actual value of a company, and points out that \u201cthere are literally \n\nthousands of discounted cash flow models in existence\u201d3 1e, to work around this, chooses to \n\ncategorize it into three groups: i) Equity Valuation; ii) Firm Valuation; iii) Adjusted Present \n\nValue (APV) Valuation. \n\n2.2.1.1. Equity Valuation Models \n\nIn equity valuation models, analysts/investors attempts to assess the company from the \n\nshareholders perspective where the cash flows are considered belonging to the equity holders \n\nand discounted at the rate of return required by them (cost of equity).  \n\n                                                           \n3 Damodaran, A. (2002), Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset, 2nd \nEdition \u2013 University Edition, New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nIn this category it can be found two different models: i) Dividend Discount Model (DDM), in \n\nwhich the expected cash flow to the equity is equivalent to the expected shareholders \n\ndividends in perpetuity; ii) Free cash flow to the equity (FCFE), which are considered all \n\ncash flows distributed to shareholders, as well as the potentials, i.e. those that the company \n\ngenerates, but for some reason chooses not to distribute. \n\n? Dividend Discount Model (DDM) \n\nDividend Discount Model (DDM) is a method for valuing the price of a stock for a company \n\nwhich pays out dividends, assuming that the price of a stock is equivalent to the sum of all of \n\nits future dividend payments discounted to the present value. In general, the value of each \n\naction is given by: \n\n[1] ????? ????? = ?\n?(????????? ??? ?????)? \n\n(1+??)?\n\n?=?\n\n?=1\n \n\nVarious theories and variants of this base model have been developed to include the fact that \n\ncompanies distribute an amount of dividends depending on the development stage they are \n\nin.  \n\n \n\nIn 1962, Gordon developed a model (Gordon Growth Model or Constant Growth Model) \n\nwhich states that, for companies with a stable growth and no dividend retain, the value of \n\ntheir equity can be represented as a growing perpetuity based on the expected dividend of the \n\nnext period (Foerster and Sapp, 2005), confirming the need to estimate the annual dividends \n\nin perpetuity. \n\n[2] ????? ????? = ?\n?(????????? ??? ?????)? \n\n(1+??)?\n\n?=?\n\n?=1\n \n\nIn this method still stands out the development of two models that circumvent the limitations \n\nimposed by the general DDM and Gordon Growth Model. The first model mentioned by \n\nDamodaran (2006) is a natural extension of Gordon model data which includes two stages of \n\ngrowth: i) an initial period where the growth rate is not stable dividend and then ii) stabilizes \n\nand is expected to remain in perpetuity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nThe second model, made by Fuller and Hsia (1984), is also a two-stage model, but initially \n\nassumes that the growth rate of the dividend increases linearly until a sustainable growth. \n\n? Free cash flow to the equity \u2013 FCFE \n\nFCFE values a company\u2019s equity by computing future cash flows to equity and discounting \n\nthem at the expected cost of equity. Traditional CFE represent what is available for \n\ndistribution to shareholders after capital expenditures and net working capital needs have \n\nbeen met, as well as, financial obligations (Damodaran, 2002 and 2006). \n\n[3] Free Cash Flow to Equity = Net Income \u2013 Capital Expenditures + Depreciations - ? Non-Cash \n\nWorking Capital + (New Debt Issued \u2013 Debt Payments) \n\nDamodaran (2006) compares DDM with FCFE, renaming the latter \u201cpotential dividend \n\nmodel\u201d4, it means that if a company was to pay out to its shareholders all its cash flows after \n\ndebt payment and reinvestment needs, both DDM (considering company doesn\u2019t inflate \n\ndividends by borrowing) and FCFE methods would yield the same value for the company. \n\n2.2.1.2. Firm Valuation Models \n\nThese models develops another approach to valuation where the entire firm is valued, by \n\ndiscounting the cumulated cash flows to all claim holders (shareholders or creditors) in the \n\nfirm by the weighted average cost of capital (the cost of capital approach) (Damodaran, 2006) \n\nor by adding the marginal impact of debt on value to the unlevered firm value (adjusted \n\npresent value approach) (Kaplan and Ruback, 1995). Within this category of evaluation, the \n\nmain models are the Free Cash Flow to Firm \u2013 FCFF and the Economic Value Added \u2013 EVA. \n\nIn this project is only referenced the first model that will be used to assess Sonangol. \n\n? Free Cash Flow to Firm \u2013 FCFF \n\nThe FCFF model correspond to the sum of the cash flows that all holders of the company \n\n(e.g. common and preferred shareholders and creditors) are entitled. \n\n                                                           \n4 Damodaran, A. (2006), Valuation Approaches and Metrics: A Survey of the Theory and Evidence, Stern School of \nBusiness, New York University \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nDamodaran (2002) defends that the cash flow to the firm can be measured in two ways. One \n\nis to add up the cash flows to all the different claim holders in the firm. Thus, the cash flows \n\nto equity investors (which take the form of dividends or stock buybacks) are added to the cash \n\nflows to debt holders (interest and net debt payments) to arrive at the cash flow to the firm. \n\nThe other approach to estimating cash flow to the firm, which should yield equivalent results, \n\nis to estimate the cash flow to the firm prior to debt payments but after reinvestment needs \n\nhave been met. \n\n[4] ???? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? (????) = ???? (1 ? ??? ????) ? (??????? ???????????? ?\n\n????????????) ? ?????? ?? ??????? ??????? ??????? \n\nThe difference between capital expenditures and depreciation (net capital expenditures) and \n\nthe increase in noncash working capital represent the reinvestments made by the firm to \n\ngenerate future or contemporaneous growth.  \n\nAnother way of representing the same equation is to sum up the net capital expenditures and \n\nthe change in working capital, and state that value as a percentage of the after-tax operating \n\nincome. This ratio of reinvestment to after-tax operating income is called the reinvestment \n\nrate, and the free cash flow to the firm can be written as: \n\n[5] ???? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? (????) = ???? (1 ? ??? ????)\u2013  ??????? ???????????? +\n\n ????????????? + ???????????? \u2013  ? ??????? ??????? \u00b1  ????? ??? ???? ????? \n\nMany authors argue that this model can serve multiple purposes. According to Goedhart et al \n\n(2005a), this model should be used in the evaluation of investment projects and in the \n\nevaluation of companies with multiple businesses; contrary to Damodaran (2002 and 2006) \n\nand Fern\u00e1ndez (2009) who argue that this model should only be used in the evaluation of \n\ncompanies that claim to have a fixed capital structure. \n\n? Terminal Value or Continuity/Perpetuity Value \n\nAccording to Kaplan &amp; Ruback (1996), the FCFF Model is the most commonly-used DCF \n\napproach, on which the value of a leveraged firm can be calculated by discounting the \n\nunleveraged cash flows to the firm at the firm weighted average cost of capital (WACC). \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nThus: \n\n[6] ???? ????? = ? 1??\n?????\n\n(1+????)?\n+\n\n?????+1/(????????)\n\n(1+????)1\n  \n\nIndeed, this formula is composed by two stages: the first is computed the present value of \n\ncash-flows up to some preselected horizon date (n), which according to Ohlson &amp; Zhang \n\n(1999) is rarely superior to 15 years; and the second is calculated to the present value of cash-\n\nflows beyond the horizon date referred as the terminal value (TGR represents the terminal \n\ngrowth rate). \n\n? WACC Rate  \n\nAs mentioned above, one of the commonly-used discount rate in cash flow calculation \n\napproaches is the tax-adjusted discount rate or weighted average cost of capital (Kaplan &amp; \n\nRuback, 1996)5. According to this \u201cmethod\u201d, WACC represents a weighted average of the \n\nafter-tax costs of different sources of capital (equity and debt), in which each one is weighted \n\nby the fraction of the capital structure it represents (Luehrman, 1997). \n\n \n\nThe weighted average cost of capital \u2013 WACC combines the rates of return required by \n\nshareholders and creditors and is calculated as follows: \n\n[7] ???? =\n?\n\n?+?\n?? +\n\n?\n\n?+?\n??(1 ? ??);  where Re is the cost of equity and Rd is the cost of debt, \n\nE is the equity and D the debt, and Tc is the corporate tax rate. \n\nIndeed, WACC\u2019s main advantage is that it bundles the two sources of capital together in order \n\nto discount them only once. \n\n?  WACC variables: \n\n- Cost of Equity (Re) \n\nThe cost of equity is the rate of return investors require on an equity investment in a firm \n\n(Damodaran, 2002). The most common theories to measure the cost of equity is the Capital \n\nAsset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Sharpe 1964), Fama-French Three-Factor Model (Fama e \n\n                                                           \n5 Kaplan, S. N., and R. S. Ruback. \"The Market Pricing of Cash Flow Forecasts: Discounted Cash Flow vs. the Method \nof Comparables.\" Journal of Applied Corporate Finance 8, no. 4 (winter 1996): 45\u201360 \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nFrench, 1992) and the Arbitrage Price Theory (APT) (Ross 1976), being the most used the \n\nCAPM model which according to Damodaran (2002) is \u201cthe risk and return model that has \n\nbeen in use the longest and is still the standard in most real world analyses\u201d6. \n\n \n\nAccording to Kaplan and Peterson (1998), the CAPM defines linear relationship between the \n\ncost of equity and the slope coefficient (beta) in a regression of the company\u2019s equity returns. \n\nIn other words, the CAPM embodied by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Black (1972) \n\nconclude that the return of an asset is the sum of the risk-free rate and the risk-premium, \n\nwhich depends on beta. In order to calculate the expected return one needs the following \n\ninputs; risk free rate, security\u2019s beta, equity risk premium and country risk premium if \n\napplicable. \n\n[8] ???? ?? ?????? = ?? +  ?? (?? ? ??) + CRP \n\n- Risk Free Interest Rate (Rf) \n\nIn theory, a riskless asset can be defined as one for which the investor knows the expected \n\nreturns with certainty, meaning that there is no default risk or risks associated with \n\nreinvestment. Damodaran (2008) considers that the only assets that meet these criteria are \n\nzero-cupon government bonds, without risk of bankruptcy, whose maturity is equal to the \n\ncash flows being discounted. Another important aspect to note is the fact that the risk-free \n\ninterest rate and the cash flows must be in the same currency, otherwise the assessment may \n\nbe biased by the inflation value. This is particularly severe in economies with high inflation \n\nrate (Damodaran, 2008). \n\n- Beta (?)  \n\nBeta is the risk parameter of an individual asset, according to (Fama &amp; French, 2004) \u201cthe \n\nmarket beta of asset I is the covariance of its return with the market return divided by the \n\nvariance of the market return\u201d7. \n\n                                                           \n6 Damodaran, A. (2002), Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset, 2nd \nEdition \u2013 University Edition, New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. \n7 Fama, Eugene F., and Kenneth R. French. 2004. \"The Capital Asset Pricing Model: Theory and Evidence.\" Journal of \nEconomic Perspectives, 18(3): 25-46 \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nAs beta is not directly observed on the market, it has to be estimated, which means developing \n\na set of assumptions and methodologies. \n\nAccording to Damodaran (2002), the conventional approach to estimating the beta of an \n\ninvestment is a regression of returns on the investment against returns on a market index over \n\na reasonable time period. In practice there is a tendency to use a stock index, such as for \n\nexample S&amp;P500, as a proxy for the market portfolio, and estimate betas for stocks against \n\nthe index. \n\nThe standard procedure for estimating betas is to regress stock returns against market returns, \n\nwhere the slope of the regression corresponds to the beta of the stock and measures the \n\nriskiness of the stock. \n\n \n\nAs an alternative to linear regression, may be used the beta of the unlevered beta of industry \n\nas an operating company \u2013 ??, since companies operating in the same industry are exposed \n\nto similar operational risks (Goedhart et al 2005a). In turn, the beta of a leveraged company \n\n\u2013 ?? can be obtained from its operating beta, using one of the three theories presented in the \n\nfollowing table: \n\nTable II - Beta Approaches \n\n \n\n- Risk Premium  \n\nThe risk premium is a significant input in all the asset pricing models. According to \n\nDamodaran (2002) the risk premium measures the \u201cextra return\u201d that would be demanded by \n\ninvestors for shifting their money from a riskless investment to an average risk investment\u201d. \n\nIn the standard approach to estimating equity risk premiums three basic approaches are used \n\n\u2013 the survey approach, where investors or managers are asked to provide estimates of the \n\nequity risk premium for the future, the historical return approach, where the premium is based \n\nupon how well equities have done in the past and the implied approach, where we use future \n\nFern\u00e1ndez (2003) Damodaran (2002) Goedhart et al (2005\u00aa) \n\n \n\n??= ??+(?????) \u00d7D/E\u00d7 (1??) ??= ??+(??) \u00d7?/?\u00d7(1??) ??= ??\u00d7(1+?/?) \n\nSource: Fern\u00e1ndez (2003)       \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\ncash flows or observed bond default spreads to estimate the current equity risk premium \n\n(Damodaran, 2012 and Fern\u00e1ndez, 2004). \n\nThe most common approach to estimating the risk premium is to base it on historical data by \n\nlooking to the difference between average returns on stocks and average returns on riskless \n\nsecurities over an extended period of history. \n\n- Cost of Debt (Rd) \n\nThe cost of debt measures the current cost to the firm of borrowing funds to finance projects. \n\nThe simplest scenario for estimating the cost of debt occurs when a firm has long-term bonds. \n\nThe market price of the bond, in conjunction with its cupon and maturity can serve to compute \n\na yield which is used as the cost of debt. \n\nWhen no rating is available to estimate the cost of debt, Damodaran (2002) suggests checking \n\nthe recent bank borrowing history or estimating a synthetic rating using interest coverage \n\nratio. \n\n2.2.1.3. Adjusted Present Value Model \u2013 APV  \n\nThe Adjusted Present Value (APV), as developed by Myers (1974), defines the value of a \n\nlevered firm as the value of an otherwise identical but unlevered firm plus the value of any \n\n\u201cside effects\u201d due to leverage. These side effects often include the tax shield of debt, expected \n\nbankruptcy costs, and agency costs. The APV provides a powerful framework for analyzing \n\na variety of issues in corporate finance, and is especially useful in applications of corporate \n\nvaluation. \n\n[9]?????????? ????? =  ?\n?????\n\n(1+??)?\n+  \n\n?????+1 (????)\n\n(1+??)?\n?=?\n?=1 + ??( ??? ??????) ?  ?? (?????????? ?????) \n\nAccording to Luehrman (1997), APV is highly helpful in the valuation of cross-border \n\ntakeovers, although the use of the correct valuation approach depends on the nature of a firm\u2019s \n\ncapital structure (Kaplan &amp; Ruback, 1996). Indeed, the APV represents a model which can \n\nincorporate easily the impact of dividend policy, or even transaction costs in financing, and \n\nis extraordinarily transparent concerning in adjustments to the discount rate (Myers, 1974). \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nNotwithstanding, the APV concept presents certain handicaps: first of all, the income from \n\nstocks can be taxed in a different way, when the investor files a personal tax return; in \n\naddition, analysts usually ignore the use of other financing side effects in order to avoid \n\ncomplexity in getting the APV estimation (Luehrman, 1997). \n\n \n\nAccording to Damodaran (2002) there are many authors who believe that adjusted present \n\nvalue is a more flexible way of approaching valuation than traditional discounted cash flow \n\nmodels. This may be true in a generic sense, but APV valuation in practice has significant \n\nflaws. The first and most important is that most practitioners who use the adjusted present \n\nvalue model ignore expected bankruptcy costs. Adding the tax benefits to unlevered firm \n\nvalue to get to the levered firm value makes debt seem like an unmixed blessing. Firm value \n\nwill be overstated, especially at very high debt ratios, where the cost of bankruptcy is clearly \n\nnot zero and, in some instances, the cost of bankruptcy is higher than the tax benefit of debt. \n\n2.2.2. Relative Valuation  \n\nIn discounted cash flow valuation, the objective is to find the value of assets, given their \n\ncash flow, growth, and risk characteristics. In relative valuation, the objective is to value \n\nassets, based on how similar assets are currently priced in the market. \n\nTo compare the values of \u201csimilar\u201d assets in the market, it needs to standardize the values in \n\nsome way. They can be standardized relative to the earnings they generate, to the book value \n\nor replacement value of the assets themselves, or to the revenues that they generate \n\n(Damodaran, 2002). \n\nDamodaran (2002) argued that evaluations based on multiple i) require fewer assumptions, \n\nso they become more rapid than the DCF valuations; ii) are simpler to present to clients; iii) \n\nreflect the state of the market, given that assess the relative value of assets rather than its \n\nintrinsic value. \n\nKaplan and Ruback (1995) add that the relative valuation presents better performance than \n\nthe DCF valuation, as it incorporates the market expectations of the future cash flows and \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\ninterest rates. However, these authors found that the absence of similar companies can be a \n\ncounter of this method. \n\nDamodaran (2002) also added that the facility associated with this method may result in an \n\ninconsistent estimate because critical variables such as the level of risk, growth and cash flow \n\npotential, can be ignored. In addition, this author also emphasizes the ease of manipulation of \n\nsome multiple (via the lack of transparency relative to the underlying assumptions) and the \n\nfact that market context is directly reflected in the evaluation, which can cause the (sub) or \n\noverestimate. \n\n \n\nTherefore, Fern\u00e1ndez (2002) defended that multiples are useful in a second stage of the \n\nvaluation: after performing the valuation using another method, a comparison with the \n\nmultiples of comparable firms enables analysts to gage the valuation performed and identify \n\ndifferences between the firms valued and the firms it is compared with. \n\nTable III - Multiples Valuation Approaches \nEarnings Multiples  Book Value Multiples Revenue Multiples Sector-Specific Multiples \n\nPrice/Earnings Ratio (PE) Price/Book value (of equity)(PBV) Price/Sales per Share Price/kwh   \n\nValue/EBIT  Value/Book Value of Assets Value/Sales  Price per ton of steel  \n\nValue/EBITDA Value/Replacement Costs      \n\nValue/FCFF                   \n\nSource: Damodaran, A., 2002, Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset, Second Edit ion, New York: John \n\nWiley &amp; Son \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Contingent Claim Valuation \n\nContingent claim valuation, most commonly known as option theory, \u201cuses option pricing \n\nmodels to measure the value of assets that share option characteristics\u201d (Damoradan, 2006). \n\nFor Luehrman (1997) \u201cOption Pricing methods are most adequate to be used when valuing \n\nopportunities\u201d8. For some companies (e.g. new technologies or fast-growing markets) \n\nopportunities are their most valuable \u201casset\u201d. Option valuation is used to decide whether or \n\nnot to make a decision, having in mind the specific circumstances involved. This flexibility \n\nthat options give are of great value and its impact on a company\u2019s valuation is not considered \n\nin the methodologies explained before. The most widely used option pricing models are the \n\n                                                           \n8 Luehrman, T. A., 1997, What's it Worth? A General Manager's Guide to Valuation, Harvard Business Review, May-\nJune 1997, 132-142 \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nbinomial and the Black-Scholes model. However, due to the complexity of these models and \n\ngiven the fact that they will not be applied on Sonangol\u2019s valuation due to the lack of \n\ninformation, no further analysis will be presented. \n\n2.2.4. Asset Based Valuation  \n\nIn the asset-based approach, primary emphasis is placed on the fair market value of the assets \n\nand liabilities of a business (Damodaran, 2006). As a result, this approach uses three methods \n\nthat consider the value of individual assets and liabilities. The first is the Liquidation Value, \n\nwhere the company's value is determined by the sum of recipes developed with the liquidation \n\nof its assets. The second one is the Replacement Cost in the company's value and represents \n\nthe full costs that the company would have to replace all of its assets. The latest model is the \n\nbook value, where it is considered that the company's value corresponds to the book value of \n\nits assets. \n\n \n\nConsidering that there are several accounting standards (e.g. GAAP and IFRS), comparability \n\nbetween companies from different sectors and countries may be called into question as well \n\nas the ease with which some companies accounting purposes manipulate cash flows and thus \n\nthe value of the company. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n3. COMPANY PRESENTATION \n\nEstablished in 1976 Sonangol \u2013 (\u201cSociedade Nacional de Combust\u00edveis de Angola, E.P.\u201d) is \n\nan integrated oil and gas Angolan state-owned company whose mission is the management \n\nof hydrocarbon resource exploration in the country while maintaining its ongoing \n\ncommitment to the development and growth of Angola. Despite having the government as \n\nthe sole shareholder, Sonangol has always been governed as a private company and is under \n\nstrict performance standards to ensure efficiency and productivity. \n\n \n\nSonangol's activities include exploration, development, marketing, production, transportation \n\nand refining of hydrocarbons and its derivatives. Those activities can be performed \n\nindependently or in association with other companies - national or foreign. As the \n\nconcessionaire, in 2014 Sonangol held stakes in 17 of the 26 blocks explored in Angola, \n\nreaching an average daily production of 1.6mn barrels of oil and 1.2mn bcm\u2019s per year of dry \n\nnatural gas. The Group holds 18 subsidiaries and exports oil and its derivatives mainly to 16 \n\ncountries, namely: Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Japan, India, Italy, Netherland, \n\nPortugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, USA, Uruguay and Taiwan. \n\nAs the country's main investment vehicle, Sonangol owns a diversified portfolio of \n\ninvestments both in domestic and international market, operating at this point in several other \n\nindustries beyond the Energy Industry, namely: air services, telecommunications services, \n\nfinancial services, real estate, medical and medicines services, education and training \n\nservices. \n\n \n\nSonangol E.P. is based in Luanda, Angola with additional offices in Brazzaville, Congo; \n\nHong Kong; Houston, Texas; London, United Kingdom; and Singapore. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n3.1 Business Portfolio \n\nSonangol\u2019s business model consists of five primary business segments: \n\nTable IV - Sonangol Business Portfolio \n\n3.2 Strategy and Future Goals \n\nThe Angolan government is targeting a daily average production of 1.8mn barrels (bbl) of oil \n\nin 2015. This is an increase of 10% relative to the growth rate foreseen in the General State \n\nBudget (OGE). Meanwhile, Sonangol E.P. plans to spend USD 8.8bn on exploration in the \n\nnext decade, targeting an output of 2mn barrels per day (b/d) by 2017. China will lend USD \n\n2bn to Sonangol to aid in the expansion of oil and gas projects. The financing agreement will \n\nlast for 10 years, and the first project that will benefit from the fund will be the 200,000 b/d \n\nSonaRef oil refinery in Lobito. \n\n \n\nSonangol is planning to launch a bidding round for exploration of 12 new offshore oil blocks \n\nin 2015. Sonangol can sit back confidently and watch its international oil company operated \n\nprojects begin to haul in impressive returns. Through careful placing of JV contracts, the firm \n\nbenefits from the most up-to-date exploration and production (E&amp;P) techniques, and the \n\ngroup\u2019s reserves and profits look set to grow organically, without the need for any policy \n\nchange or acquisition moves. The announcement that Angola is now China\u2019s largest supplier \n\nof oil is encouraging news for Sonangol. Meanwhile, JVs will lead to the transfer of know-\n\nhow, technical equipment and financial backing, benefiting production levels. Amid strong \n\nCorporate &amp; Finance  Upstream Midstream Downstream Non-Core \n? This Segment includes the \n\nfunding\u2019s and investments \n\nof the Sonangol's Group. \n\n? It has a total assets worth of \nUSD 14bn and it has a \n\nrevenue value of approx. \n\nEUR1.2bn.  \n\n? In this segment, Sonangol \nowns two subsidiaries \n\nnamely, Sonangol  E.P. and \n\nSonangol Finance. \n\n? This Segment develops research \nactivities and production of \n\nOil&amp;Gas in onshore and \n\noffshore, either as operator or as \n\nnot operator in a joint venture. \n\n? This is the most important \nsegment of the group, \n\nresponsible for presenting about \n\nEUR 18bn of Revenues and a \n\nTotal Assets value of EUR \n\n17bn. \n\n? The Sonangol\u2019s subsidiaries on \nthis segments are: Sonangol \n\nDrilling, Sonangol Exploration \n\nand Production; Sonangol \n\nInternational Hydrocarbons and \n\nSonangol Natural Gas. \n\n? This segment includes \nactivities of transport \n\nand delivery of \n\nderivatives and refining \n\nof crude oil and natural \n\ngas. \n\n? Despite recorded \nrevenues of EUR 1.7bn, \n\nthis segment presented \n\nin FY2014 a negative \n\nnet income due to the \n\nnegative amount \n\nverified in the financial \n\nresults and high \n\noperational costs. \n\n? The company owns 35 \nsubsidiaries on this \n\nsegment being the most \n\nimportant the Sonangol \n\nShipping and Sonangol \n\nRefining. \n\n? This Segment \nincludes the storage \n\nactivities, marketing \n\nand distribution of \n\nproducts to the final \n\ncostumer. \n\nThe company \n\nrecorded on this \n\nsegment Revenues of \n\napprox.EUR 7.6bn \n\nand has a total assets \n\nvalue of EUR 4bn. \n\n? The subsidiaries on \nthis segment are: \n\nSonangol Logistics, \n\nSonangol Distributor \n\nand Sonangol \n\nInternational \n\nMarketing. \n\n? Sonangol is the \nleading company \n\noperating on this \n\nsegment. \n\n? This segment includes all  \n\"non-core\" segments of \n\nthe Group namely air \n\nservices, healthcare, \n\ntelecommunication and \n\nreal estate investments. \n\nThis segment contributed \n\nwith revenues of approx. \n\nEUR 9.5mn. \n\n? Sonangol E.P. owns 10 \ndifferent subsidiaries, \n\nbeing the most important \n\nthe following: \n\n- Sonair, MsTelecom, \n\nSonangol Holding, \n\nSonangol Industrial \n\nInvestments, Sonangol \n\nReal Estate Investments.. \n\nSource: Company Filings     \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nexploration activity, output will continue to rise with the government increasingly building \n\nrelations with China, Beijing stands to benefit, while Angola\u2019s membership of OPEC should \n\nbring significant technological and financial benefits, as well as increasing the government \n\nand Sonangol\u2019s influence in international energy markets. \n\n- Angola LNG \n\nRegarding the natural gas sector, Angola LNG project is a JV of the major producers in the \n\ncountry including Sonangol, Chevron, BP, Eni and Total. Angola LNG plant has a processing \n\ncapacity of 7.2n cubic meters (bcm) per annum and it is now under a massive reconstruction \n\nto fix design defects and corrosion of almost-new equipment. Officially, the plant will remain \n\nclosed until mid-2015. However, extension of the closure could reportedly extend into 2016, \n\ndepending on the scale of the renovation work. \n\n- Discoveries and Surveys \n\nItalian oil and gas company Eni has encountered a new deep-water oil discovery offshore in \n\nAngola with an estimated capacity to produce 300mn bbl of oil.  \n\nThe Spain's Repsol will provide Sonangol with the tools for a seismic survey of the oil \n\nreserves in the so-called pre-salt layer. Under the terms of an agreement signed between the \n\ntwo companies, Sonangol's engineers will have the right to use the advanced technology \n\ndesigned by Repsol, to use it to survey oil reserves in the pre-salt layer.  \n\n3.3. Operational Performance \n\nAnalyzing the historical financial statements of Sonangol, it was possible to draw briefly the \n\ncompany's performance in terms of operational profit, debt capacity and realized investment \n\nas referenced below. \n\n- Turnover  \n\nUntil an alternative fuel source becomes readily available, oil will be in high demand allowing \n\nvertically integrated oil companies to generate astronomical revenues. In addition, the oil and \n\ngas production is capital intensive, especially when fuel costs are high. Given that, on the last \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nthree years of analysis, Sonangol E.P. presented a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) \n\nof 3.6% in the Total Turnover. The fiscal year (\u201cFY\u201d) of 2014 Sonangol recorded a total \n\nTurnover of approx. EUR 28.6bn, a decrease of 4.4% compared to the FY2013 due to the \n\ndeclining of oil prices registered on last quarter of the year as well as the decrease of 2.56% \n\nin the total production. \n\nSonangol\u2019s Net Income in 2014 was approx. EUR 1.1bn, a decrease of 49% comparing to the \n\nprevious year.  \n\n- EBITDA  \n\nRegarding EBITDA, in FY2014 the company totaled EUR 4.9bn compared to EUR 5.2bn in \n\nFY2013, a decrease of 5.6%. This decrease influenced by the serious \u201ccrise\u201d recorder in oil \n\nprices, resulted in an EBITDA margin of 17.1% in FY2014, strengthening the company\u2019s \n\nEBITDA with a CAGR of 2.3%.  \n\n \n\nAnalyzing EBITDA margins by business segment it is possible to highlight that upstream \n\nsegment was the largest contributor to the positive EBITDA margin with approx. 16%, \n\nfollowed by the Downstream and Midstream segment with EBITDA margin of 3.7% and \n\n0.4% respectively. \n\nIt should be noted that Sonangol is the market leader in the downstream segment in Angola, \n\nbecause it is the only company responsible for the distribution of O&amp;G products to the final \n\ncustomer. In what concerns to the upstream segment, Sonangol holds approx. 44% market \n\nshare being the market leader in Angola.  \n\n- Investments \n\nIn terms of investment, in FY2014 the company comprised 88% of its investments in mining \n\nactivity (research, development and exploration) and 12% in other financial investments (real \n\nestate projects and financial markets, more specifically energy funds) accounting for a total \n\namount of EUR 14bn. This value had presented an increase of approx. 16% compared to \n\nFY2013 where the company recorded an investment amount of EUR 12bn. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nIt is notable that until the year 2014 Sonangol E.P. had about 80 participations in other \n\ncompanies. Highlighting the most important, it is to point out the majority stake in 8 banks \n\n(4 in Angola and 2 in Portugal) making it quite accessible the company\u2019s recourse to bank \n\ncredit. The net value of the investment in subsidiaries in 2014 was approx. of EUR 4.4bn. \n\n- Leverage  \n\nFollowing the investments growth recorded in 2014 the company increased its debt to approx. \n\nEUR 12bn, an increase of 30% regarding FY2013 with approx. EUR 9.9bn. Nearly 82% of \n\nthe Sonangol\u2019s debt was from long-term debt and the remaining 18% short-term debt. The \n\nSonangol\u2019s current debt ratio for FY2014 was 29.5%. The net debt value presented in FY2014 \n\nwas c. EUR 7.2bn and the Leverage ratio was 1.47x (Net Debt to EBITDA). \n\n- Financial Structure  \n\nAnalyzing Sonangol\u2019s Financial Structure it is possible to highlight that the company has \n\nbeen aggressive in financing its growth with debt. Most of this funding was resorted to long \n\nterm debt (Debt Structure of 30%), reducing the treasury cash pressure. The financial strength \n\nseems ensured, because it has 36% more Equity than the Total Debt subscribed. Sonangol \n\npresented in FY2014 a positive Working Capital value, showing that the company is in \n\nequilibrium in the short term, once the current assets are sufficient to pay current liabilities. \n\nThe company has a financial solvency ratio of 1.36x a high value that proves the financial \n\nsoundness of Sonangol. \n\n- Treasury \n\nIn 2014 Sonangol E.P., permanent capital only covered 87% of the value of fixed assets, with \n\nthe remaining 13% being financed by short-term debt. It is aware that this situation only \n\noccurred in the FY2014, and despite this, the company achieved a positive net treasury value \n\nof EUR 3.4bn. It is noteworthy that despite this problem of financial structure, Sonangol has \n\naccess to short-term credit and generate sufficient cash to support the interests. \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n4. INDUSTRY AND MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n\nOn this chapter it will be analysed the macroeconomic scenario in countries9 where Sonangol \n\nEP concentrates its activities mainly through exports, using as main sources statistical data of \n\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Business Monitor International \n\n(BMI). \n\n4.1 Macroeconomic Outlook \n\n? Angola  \n\nAngola\u2019s economy is strongly dependent on hydrocarbons, with oil comprising 38% of GDP, \n\nmore than 70% of fiscal revenues and more than 90% of merchandise export earnings. This \n\nhas served the nation well during periods of rising commodity prices but could again become \n\na handicap, especially after oil output begins to decline from 2014 onwards. \n\nEconomic diversification is proceeding but at a slow pace. Angola thus experienced a sharp \n\nslowdown in 2009, followed by a strong rebound in 2010 and 2011. The currency is heavily \n\nmanaged against the US dollar, which creates a structural rigidity that reduces the ability of \n\nthe economy to respond to macroeconomic shocks and makes it difficult for local producers \n\nto compete with cheap imports. \n\nDespite falling oil prices, headline economic growth in Angola will continue to be supported \n\nby the non-oil economy and it is predictable that real GDP growth will expand by 4.50% in \n\n2015 and 3.90% in 2016, driven by capital-intensive industries such as energy, construction \n\nand transport. \n\nTable V - Angola's GDP ?% \n\nDescription Units 2013 2014 2015F 2016F 2017F 2018F 2019F 2020F \n\nGDP, constant prices ? % 6,80 4,22 4,50 3,94 5,13 5,28 5,61 5,84 \nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015 \n \n\n? China  \n\nAs the largest economic partner of Angola and the largest customer of Sonangol representing \n\napprox. 47% of the Group exports, has recently present alarming indications. Analysts predict \n\n                                                           \n9 Countries that represent more than 5% of Sonangol total sales. The macroeconomic data from other countries will be \nreflected on the Appendix 2  \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nthat economic growth in China will continue to fall in 2015, with GDP growth estimated to \n\nbe between 6.0%-7.0%. Rather than experiencing an abrupt crash, the economy is slowly \n\ndownshifting from high to medium growth. By category, manufacturing activities seemed to \n\nlose steam whereas the service sector held up well.  \n\nA confluence of growth headwinds led to the slowdown: first, persistent external uncertainty, \n\narising from the imbalanced recovery in advanced countries, continued to weighed on China\u2019s \n\nexports; second, the enforcement of the new budget law has led to fiscal consolidation at the \n\nlocal government level and thereby depressed aggregate demand; third, the recently \n\nimplemented easing measures, including two interest rate cuts and two RRR cuts. Deflation \n\nrisk is on the rise. Moreover, a number of factors could exacerbate the price stability, \n\nincluding the potential burst of property bubble, the over-capacity in certain industries, the \n\nhigh debt level of the corporate sector and the ageing of population. Given the size of the \n\nChinese economy in absolute terms, this slowdown is natural, and unlike after previous \n\nslowdowns, a significant rebound in growth should not be expected. \n\nTable VI - China's GDP ?% \n\nDescription Units 2013 2014 2015F 2016F 2017F 2018F 2019F 2020F \n\nGDP, constant prices ? % 7,75 7,36 6,76 6,30 6,00 6,10 6,33 6,33 \nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015 \n\n? India  \n\nIndia the second largest Sonangol\u2019s client, comprises 13% of its exports. The outlook for \n\nIndia is for economic strengthening through higher infrastructure spending, increased fiscal \n\ndevolution to states, and continued reform to financial and monetary policy. The government \n\nunderscored its intention to move steadily to tackle politically difficult structural issues that \n\nhave stalled investment and limited economic performance in recent years. Growth in the \n\ngross domestic product is expected to accelerate to 7.4% in FY2015 on improved \n\nperformance in both industry and services as policy addresses structural bottlenecks and \n\nexternal demand improves. In 2014 India recorded a GDP growth of 7.1%, with industry \n\ngrowing 5.8%. In macroeconomic terms India has excellent indicators, with this beneficial \n\nway for business Sonangol. \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nTable VII - India's GDP ?% \n\nDescription Units 2013 2014 2015F 2016F 2017F 2018F 2019F 2020F \n\nGDP, constant prices ? % 6,90 7,17 7,46 7,47 7,55 7,65 7,70 7,75 \nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015 \n\n? Canada \n\nCanada is the third largest customer of the Group comprising c. 6.0% of its exports of crude. \n\nDespite the financial and economic strength of the country the macroeconomic forecast for \n\nthis country is not the most favourable. The negative effects of the oil shock on Canada\u2019s \n\neconomy are expected to have a more immediate effect than previously estimated. The impact \n\non household spending, terms of trade and investment, particularly in the oil and gas sector \n\nare already becoming apparent. As for the external sector the bank of Canada has estimated \n\nthat Canada\u2019s term of trade will fall 9.0% by the end of 2015 as a result of suppressed oil \n\nexport values. Meanwhile, figures for GDP 2015 showed that it is expected an increase of \n\n2.16%. \n\nTable VIII - Canada GDP ?% \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015 \n\n? Spain \n\nComprising c. 6.0% of Sonangol\u2019s exports, a robust growth is projected in Spain over the \n\nnext two years, driven by very supportive financial conditions, as well as the depreciation of \n\nthe euro, lower oil prices and strengthening trading partner growth. Renewed consumer \n\nconfidence and increasing fixed investment drove the economy to record its largest expansion \n\nsince 2007, consolidating the country\u2019s place as one of the fastest growing economies in the \n\nEurozone. Meanwhile, figures for GDP 2015 showed that it is expected an increase of 2.5%. \n\n? South Africa and Taiwan  \n\nBoth countries share approximately 5% of Sonangol\u2019s exports. Regarding South Africa GDP \n\ngrowth is expected to pick up marginally in 2015. The continued recovery in the mining and \n\nmanufacturing sectors after the strike-affected first half of 2014 should support growth to \n\nsome extent. However, infrastructure bottlenecks (mainly electricity), subdued private sector \n\nfixed investment and muted growth in consumer and government consumption spending \n\nSubject Descriptor Units 2013 2014 2015F 2016F 2017F 2018F 2019F 2020F \n\nGDP, constant prices ?% 2,00 2,53 2,16 2,03 1,97 1,90 1,88 1,85 \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nmeans that a meaningful acceleration is not on the cards. Therefore it is expected a growth of \n\n2.00% in GDP in FY2015. \n\nIn the other hand, Taiwan\u2019s economy slowed slightly in the first quarter of 2015, growing \n\n3.4% over the same period of the previous year. However the slowdown came largely on the \n\nback of falling government spending\u2019s. Moreover, recent data paint a hazy picture of the \n\neconomy with exports recorded the largest drop in over a year and the manufacturing fell into \n\ncontractionary territory for the first time since 2013. The GDP expected for 2015 is presents \n\nan increase of 3.81%. \n\nTable IX - South Africa GDP ?% \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015 \n\nTable X - Taiwan GDP ?% \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015 \n\n? Other Countries \n\nSonangol holds commercial and economic links with many other countries in Europe and \n\nAmericas whose exports to these countries does not weigh more than 3%. (Appendix 2). \n\nEconomic growth in the EU remains sluggish, however the fall in crude oil prices are should \n\nprovide a welcome boost to growth. Regarding Americas, with especial attention to the Latin \n\nAmerica the grow will be low in 2015 and 2016, mainly influenced by the financial volatility \n\nin China, the impact of lower commodity prices and internal economic and political problems \n\nin prioritizing and speeding up fixed capital investments and productivity.  \n\n4.2 Industry Overview \n\n? Energy Market Overview \n\nAfter colossal growth in 2011, the global market fell in to marginal decline in 2012 followed \n\nby weak growth in 2013. Due to a huge fall in oil prices beginning in late 2014, 2015 has \n\nseen a dramatic decline within the market followed by very weak growth for the remainder \n\nof the forecast period (Appendix.9)  \n\nSubject Descriptor Units 2013 2014 2015F 2016F 2017F 2018F 2019F 2020F \n\nGDP, constant prices ?% 2,21 1,53 2,00 2,10 2,40 2,70 2,80 2,80 \n\nSubject Descriptor Units 2013 2014 2015F 2016F 2017F 2018F 2019F 2020F \n\nGDP, constant prices ?% 2,23 3,74 3,81 4,07 4,11 4,16 4,19 4,22 \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nOn November 27th 2014, OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) failed \n\nto reach an agreement over the curbing of production of oil which in turn sent prices tumbling. \n\nThis has had such an effect due to the fact that OPEC controls approximately 40% of the \n\nglobal market. The market is dictated partly by supply and demand and energy is very closely \n\nrelated to economic activity. There are a number of factors that have played a part in the oil \n\nprice slump. The poor global economic performance as well increased efficiency and \n\nalternative energy sources has led to reduced demand plus with OPEC deciding not to curb \n\nproduction, there is almost a surplus of oil. To add to this, the US has become the world's \n\nlargest producer of oil and has no need for the level of imports as it previously had in the past. \n\nFinally, Gulf oil producers have decided not to reduce production to restore price to what is \n\nclassed as normal today. \n\n  \n\nThe global oil and gas market generated in 2014 a total revenue of USD 3,073.4bn, \n\nrepresenting a CAGR of 6.7% between 2010 and 2014. In comparison, the European and \n\nAsia-Pacific markets grown with CAGRs of 3.8% and 8% respectively, over the same period, \n\nto reach respective values of USD 689.5bn and \n\nUSD 1,065.8bn in 2014.

Angola  \n\nThe outlook for Angola's oil sector remains broadly positive, with highly prospective offshore \n\nacreage and a number of major projects under development. However, sustained lower oil \n\nprices pose downside risk to production growth post-2020, as rapid natural decline rates and \n\na slowdown in investment combine to undercut output levels. Gas production will remain \n\nlimited throughout 10-year forecast period due to low domestic consumption, unfavorable \n\npricing dynamics and demand constraints in key export markets. \n\n? Central and Eastern Europe  \n\nRussia will remain the dominant force in all areas of oil and gas in the Central and Eastern \n\nEuropean region over the next 10 years despite sanctions and weak oil prices. The bulk of \n\nboth oil and gas production growth will come from Caspian countries and head to China.

EVALUATION \n\n6.1 Methodology \n\nTo assess the value of Sonangol EP two different valuation methods were used: Free Cash \n\nFlow to the Firm (FCFF) and Multiples valuation. The first, as explained in the Literature \n\nReview, is a Discounted Cash-Flow (DCF) based method, while the latter involves relative \n\nvaluation. \n\nThis methodology besides being the most widely used by investors and managers in the \n\nevaluation of companies is also the most appropriate to evaluate the Sonangol EP, given the \n\nfirm\u2019s current capital structure of approximately 40% debt. At the beginning the idea was to \n\nevaluate Sonangol in separate by the SOTP (Sum of the Parts) methodology, considering the \n\ncompany\u2019s different business units. However, due to lack of available information about the \n\ndifferent companies that comprise the Sonangol\u2019s business lines, the option was considered \n\nto evaluate the company as a whole. \n\nRelative to the time horizon of the projections was set an explicit period of five years. For the \n\nprojection of the value in perpetuity was assumed a growth rate (g) of 0.7%. All cash-flows \n\nwill be determined in Euros. \n\n6.2 Assumptions \n\nTo determine the value of Sonangol E.P. was defined a set of assumptions about the projection \n\nof FCFF and the discount rate, which will be presented below. \n\n6.2.1 Operational Assumptions \n\n? Revenues \n\nThe initial approaches in the estimation of Sonangol\u2019s revenues was based on two reports \n\nfrom BMI \u201cAngola Oil and Gas report Q2 2015\u201d, EIA \u201cAnnual Energy Outlook 2015 with \n\nprojections to 2040\u201d as well as the macroeconomic data designed to Angola by the \n\nInternational Monetary Fund. The BMI report discloses a wide range of data concerning the \n\ncurrent Energy Sector in Angola, highlighting in particular the evolution of production, \n\ncompetitiveness and exports of oil and natural gas derivatives. On the other hand the report \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nbased on EIA has been used to analyze the evolution of the Energy Sector in the world. \n\nAlongside, it\u2019s was important to forecast the consumption of the refined petroleum products \n\nin the world specifically in the OPEC countries.  \n\nFurthermore, given Sonangol\u2019s EP long-term strategies, the investments in capital \n\nexpenditures (CAPEX) and the crude oil contango10 market situation, the expected growth \n\nrate for sales are not very promising at the moment compared to previous years. According \n\nto the study performed, it was found that negative growth rates are forecasted in the short-\n\nrun, with an ongoing average growth rate of -5% in revenues for the years of 2015/16. For \n\nthe remaining periods, a higher growth rate is forecasted mainly influenced by the growth of \n\nthe exports of dry natural gas in Angola as well as the inauguration of the new Lobito\u2019s \n\nrefinery that will have the capacity to refine c. 200.000 barrels of oil per day. However, \n\nopposing to the slowdown of Angola\u2019s GDP growth and the industry\u2019s growth decline, the \n\ncurrent forecasting model expects a CAGR of c. 7% up to the year 2020. \n\nTable XII - Forecast Revenues Key Assumptions \n\n \n\nTable XIII - Sonangol's Turnover Forecast \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n10 A situation where the future price of a commodity is above the expected future spot price. \n\nItems Assumptions\n\nCrude Oil and Dry Natural Gas Exports BMI - Crude and Other Liquids Net Exports USD\n\nRefined Products Sales EIA - Petroleum and Other Liquids Consumption in Africa\n\nNon-Core Segm ents World Bank Database - Angola Real GDP Growth\n\nE UR  M illio ns\n\nSales 2014 2015F 2016F 2017F 2018F 2019F 2020F Perpetuity\n\nCrude Oil and Dry Natural Gas Exports 27.462 22.699 23.795 27.353 28.783 29.694 31.917 33.060\n\n   % of Growth n.a. -17,3% 4,8% 15,0% 5,2% 3,2% 7,5% 3,6%\n\nRefined Products Sales 890 907 937 972 1.011 1.074 1.127 1.166\n\n   % of Growth n.a. 1,9% 3,3% 3,8% 4,0% 6,2% 5,0% 3,4%\n\nNon-core Segments 303 309 319 331 344 365 384 397\n\n   % of Growth n.a. 1,9% 3,3% 3,8% 4,0% 6,2% 5,0% 3,4%\n\nTotal Revenues 28.655 23.914 25.051 28.656 30.138 31.133 33.429 34.622\n\n   % of Growth n.a. -16,5% 4,8% 14,4% 5,2% 3,3% 7,4% 3,6%\n\nS o urc e : C o m pa ny f illings , B M I Q 2  2 0 15  O &amp;G  re po rt  a nd E IA  E ne rgy S e c t o r O ut lo o k  2 0 15\n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n? Operating Costs \n\nRegarding the operational costs, Sonangol EP \n\ndoesn\u2019t dispose segmented information by \n\nbusiness units which resulted the importance \n\nof taking into consideration additional \n\nassumptions. It was found that, in the \n\nhistorical period, the variable costs (cost of sales, cost of supplies and external services, \n\nprovisions and impairment losses and other costs) accounted for approx. 88% of the total \n\ncosts of Sonangol\u2019s expenditures.  \n\n \n\nThereby, the operational costs have been estimated based on a percentage of Sonangol\u2019s total \n\nrevenues, assuming an average representation similar to the registered between the \n\nFY2012/14 (Table XIV).  \n\n? EBITDA Margin  \n\nDespite all the adverse highlighted conditions with oil market prices registered in the last \n\nquarter of FY2014, Sonangol has managed to present a historical average of 16% growth over \n\nthe last three years. \n\nFor the forecast period, it is awaited that Sonangol achieves a CAGR of approx. 6.9%, which \n\nis a positive outcome given the actual macroeconomic \u201cpanorama\u201d lived in Angola and in the \n\nEnergy Sector. \n\n6.2.2. Investment in Fixed Assets and Depreciation \n\nBetween FY2013 and FY2014, investment in Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) ranged between \n\nEUR 5.769bn and EUR 2.958bn. In this period, on average, capex amounted to 15% of \n\nrevenues. \n\nTo estimate the value of capex it was considered the following assumptions: \n\nItems Assumptions Value \n\nCost of Sales % of Sales 18.5%\n\nSelling and Administrative Expenses % of Sales 54.3%\n\nProvisions and Impairment Losses % of Sales 27.0%\n\nPersonnel Costs % of Sales 3.60%\n\nOther Costs % of Sales 6.00%\n\nS o urc e : C o m pa ny' s  f illings\n\nTable XIV - Operating Costs Assumptions \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nI.

It \n\nwas found a ratio of c. 19% for tangible assets and c. 0.7% for intangible assets.  \n\nIt was decided to adopt a more conservative approach, considering until the end of \n\nthe planned period the same growth rate recorded. \n\nII. Estimate the value of depreciations and amortizations (D&amp;A) using the average rate \n\nof the last three years, resulting their values depending on the value of Fixed Assets \n\nin the previous period.  \n\nIII.

Risk Free  \n\nAs its name implies, a risk-free assets should not be associated with any risk of bankruptcy \n\nor reinvestment. However, as Sonangol EP is a company that operates in an emerging market, \n\nadditional assumptions must be considered. In many emerging markets, the local currency is \n\nvolatile, both in terms of what it buys of developed market currencies (exchange rates) and \n\nin its own purchasing power (inflation). In some emerging market economies, the exchange \n\nrate for foreign currencies is fixed, creating the illusion of stability, but there are significant \n\nshifts every time the currency is revalued or devalued. \n\nTherefore, it was decided to convert the currency of analysis from AOA to EUR, using an \n\nannual exchange rate provided by the Angolan Central Bank. \n\n Currently the financial markets consider in a European level that the German Government \n\nbonds are close to be considered without risk. Thus, it was considered a risk-free rate of \n\n0.78% according to the yield on German 10-year bonds on Sep 8 of 201511. \n\n? Beta \n\nIn order to compute the beta of the capital of Sonangol EP it was first estimated the average \n\nunlevered beta for comparable firms. For Sonangol oil and gas segment, it was used the \n\naverage unlevered beta for integrated oil and gas companies listed globally using the \n\nargument that oil and gas are commodities that are bought and sold on a world market. For \n\nthe non-core segment it was used the unlevered beta estimated by looking at only emerging \n\nmarket comparable firms (including real estate, air transportation, education, telecom and \n\nhealthcare facilities firms), since it is very likely that those companies are far more \n\ndiscretionary in emerging markets than in developed markets (and that emerging market firms \n\nshould therefore have higher betas than developed market firms).  \n\nAfter this, it was used the debt to equity ratio and marginal tax rate for Sonangol to estimate \n\nthe levered beta for the firm. (Appendix 12) \n\n                                                           \n11 Source: Bloomberg, German Government Bonds (online). Available in: http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-\nbonds/government-bonds/germany/. Accessed September 8, 2015. \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n \n\n? Market Risk Premium \n\nTypically, investment banks, consultants and international organizations estimate that in \n\ncountries with mature capital markets as is the case of the US and Germany, the risk premium \n\nis between 4.5% and 5.5 % (Koller, Goedhart and Wessels, 2005).  \n\nIn the case of Angola an emerging market, is expected that \n\ninvestors require an additional return for investing in \n\ndomestic companies. Thus, the equity risk premium \n\n(Damodaran, 2009)12 shall be determined as follows:  \n\n[11]?????? ???? ???????=???? ??????? ??? ?????? ?????? \n\n??????+??????? ???? ??????? \n\nTo calculate the risk premium of Sonangol EP was used the methodology of default risk \n\nspreads. To this end, the German risk premium (5.81% on an Aaa rating, according to ratings \n\nagency Moody's) was added the product of a default spread of 300 basis points associated \n\nwith the Moody's rating for Angola (Ba2). Thus, we obtained a total risk premium of 10.31%, \n\nwhich is associated with a premium country risk 4.50%.  \n\n? Cost of Equity \n\nConsidering the inputs described above, the cost of equity corresponds to 25.11%, constant \n\nover definite period and in perpetuity. \n\n6.2.5 Cost of Debt  \n\nUsually it may be hard to observe a cost of debt for an emerging market company, since these \n\ncompanies often do not have publicly traded bonds. Therefore the cost of the debt was \n\nestimated using a default spread. \n\n[13] Cost of debt = Risk-free Rate + Default SpreadCountry + Default SpreadCompany \n\n                                                           \n12 Damodaran, A.(2009), Volatility Rules: Valuing Emerging Market Companies, Stern School of Business, New York \nUniversity \n\nInputs \n\nRisk-Free Rate 0,78%\n\nBeta 2,36\n\nMature market premium \n\n(Germany)\n\n5,81%\n\nCountry risk premium 4,50%\n\nTotal risk premium 10,31%\n\nCost of Equity 25,11%\n\nTable XVII - Cost of Equity Inputs \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nTo compute the cost of debt it was estimated the interest coverage ratio using information \n\nfrom Sonangol\u2019s financial statements, and a synthetic rating based on the interest coverage \n\nratio13. It was added the default spreads based on these rating to the country default spreads \n\nfor Angola to obtain pre-tax cost of debt. The cost of debt for Sonangol is 4.78% (Appendix \n\n11). \n\n6.2.6 WACC  \n\nTable XVIII - WACC Rate Inputs \n\n  \n\n6.2.7 FCFF \n\nAfter applying all assumptions, the value of Sonangol E.P. was estimated at EUR 15.566 \n\nbillion euros, with EUR 7.151bn corresponding to the continuing value (perpetuity period) \n\nand 8.416bn to the amount of time horizon (explicit period). \n\nTable XIX - Sonangol E.P.

VALUATION RESULT \n\nAfter the calculation of the Sonangol Enterprise Value through the sum of the present values \n\nof explicit and perpetual periods, it was estimated the Firm Value of the company. In order \n\nto compute the Firm Value of the company it was added the value of non-operating assets \n\nincluding financial investments, investments in subsidiaries and the amounts in cash and cash \n\nequivalents. \n\nSubsequently the company\u2019s Equity Value was obtained by removing from the Firm Value \n\nthe Sonangol\u2019s financial liabilities, particularly with financial debt and provisions. \n\nTable XX - Sonangol E.P. Valuation Result (EUR Million) \n\n \n\nThe intrinsic value of each share of Sonangol obtained in the evaluation was \u20ac9.23. It is \n\nimportant to mention that the value obtained wasn\u2019t precise due to the valuation based in the \n\ndetermined economic and sector assumptions. Furthermore, a sensibility analysis will then \n\nbe performed to allow greater certainty estimations with a wide range of values in which the \n\ngiven price can take. \n\n8. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS \n\nThe company valuation was based on the assumptions which may not verify in the near future. \n\nTherefore, consequently, the price target obtained may not correspond to the intrinsic value \n\nof the shares. In this sense it is crucial to assess the level of exposure of the Enterprise Value \n\nof Sonangol in conjunction to the relevant impact variables in the share price. \n\nFurthermore, recognizing the current instability in the markets, It has been considered the \n\npossibility of deviation occurrence from the given assumptions stated in the base scenario. \n\nPresent Value of Explicit Period 8 416\n\nPresent Value of Perpetuity Period 7 151\n\nEntreprise Value 15 566\n\n(+) Cash and Equivalents 5 729\n\n(+) Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates 4 452\n\n(+) Financial Investments 1 668\n\nFirm Value 27 415\n\n(-) Debt 12 947\n\n(-) Provisions 5 237\n\nEquity Value 9 231\n\nShares Outstanding 1 000\n\nPrice Target 9.23 \u20ac\n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\n In this context a sensitivity analysis was carried to the most significant macroeconomic and \n\noperational variables in a Ceteris Paribus basis (Appendix 14). In terms of operational \n\nassumptions, the EBITDA margin is the variable with the greatest impact on the price target \n\nof Sonangol. A variation of the EBITDA margin of 2 p.p. compared to the base scenario \n\nrepresents a positive or negative impact of 31.5% and 30.2% in the price of the Sonangol \n\nshares. Continuously, the second most sensitive variable is the WACC rate. A 2% variation \n\nin WACC rate generates a negative impact of 20.9%in the price of the company shares. The \n\nfollowing table describes the impact on the stock price of Sonangol against a joint variation \n\nof perpetual growth rate (g) as well as WACC rate. \n\nTable XXI - Cross Sensitivity Analysis Between WACC and g Rate \n\n \n\nThe sensitivity analysis solidly confirms the results obtained from the Sonangol\u2019s valuation. \n\nThe relative valuation of Sonangol and its comparable companies (Peer Group) utilizing the \n\nmultiples EV/EBITDA and P/E has permitted to succeed the successful conclusions. \n\n(Appendix. 15) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9.23 -6.0% -4.0% -2.5% -1.5% 0.0% 1.5% 2.5% 4.0% 6.0%\n\n22% 5.83 6.12 6.37 6.55 6.86 7.21 7.47 7.92 8.65\n\n20% 6.12 6.46 6.75 6.97 7.33 7.76 8.08 8.65 9.59\n\n15% 7.08 7.61 8.08 8.45 9.09 9.86 10.49 11.63 13.76\n\n10% 8.65 9.59 10.49 11.22 12.59 14.44 16.09 19.59 28.35\n\n8% 9.59 10.84 12.09 13.14 15.21 18.25 21.18 28.35 54.62\n\nW\nA\n\nC\nC\n\n R\na\n\nte\n\ng (perpetual growth)\n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n \n\n9. CONCLUSION \n\nThe company\u2019s valuation is not an exact science due to being greatly dependent on the set \n\nassumptions. Against a backdrop of economic/financial instability as well as the current \n\nvolatility of the markets, the uncertainty is greater. To mitigate the constraints, this \n\nDissertation seeks to bring together the best practices of business valuation, combining a solid \n\ntheoretical knowledge with the different market perspectives to assess Sonangol E.P. \n\nvaluation.  \n\nSonangol is a reference company in the O&amp;G sector in Angola, as well as in Africa, being \n\nactively monitoring the market and historically evidenced a careful management in the face \n\nof adversity that has felt in recent years. Since Sonangol's strategy is to increase revenues at \n\nnational level by increasing the sales of refined products and at internationally level through \n\nthe increase of exports of oil and dry natural gas, it is expected to sustainable and continued \n\ngrowth in the coming years, albeit with strong threats and uncertainties surrounding the \n\nsector. \n\nThe current drop in oil prices alongside the recent macroeconomic difficulties encountered in \n\nAngola, presents great challenges in which may arise in the Sonangol\u2019s near future. This may \n\nlead into reducing and strictly controlling all policies regarding expenses, investments and \n\nleverage. \n\nTherefore, despite the inability to determine the value of the company by the STOP method, \n\nthe intrinsic value calculated for Sonangol was \u20ac9.23. The sensitivity analysis performed in \n\nthe main valuation assumptions alongside with the market multiples of Sonangol which are \n\nlower than the average of peers (EV / EBITDA 3.17x) corroborate the evidence that there is \n\na possibility of growth, presenting itself as an attractive investment opportunity for investors. \n\nTo conclude, this dissertation can be useful to study and measure a potential Sonangol \n\nprivatization. Therefore, turning into a dispersion of capital, the company can further \n\noptimize its strategic objectives as well as relieving the pressure on the Angolan state of \n\nrunning and funding a very complex company. \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAcademic Articles and Books \n\n- Berk, J and Demarzo P., (2014) \u201cCorporate Finance\u201d (3rd edition), Prentice Hall \n\n- Bodie, Z., Kane, A., and Marcus, A.J.

Industry Analysis Using Porters Five Forces Result \n\nThe competitive force in the industry was evaluated by employing Porter\u2019s Five Forces \n\nModel. Porter\u2019s model measures competitive force through the means of; barriers to entry, \n\nbargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitutes, and degree \n\nof rivalry. These forces are used to measure opportunity with respect to the Integrated Oil and \n\nGas environment Sonangol E.P. engages in. \n\n \n\nBarriers to Entry: High \n\nThe threat of new businesses emerging within the integrated petroleum industry is quite high \n\nfor several reasons. First of all, Sonangol E.P. is state-owned company, the only \n\nconcessionaire of oil and gas in Angola and the only company in the industry capable of \n\nbringing the final product to the costumer. In addition start up costs for a new company would \n\nbe astronomical. A new start-up company would have to have the finances or access to \n\nfinances in order to compete with the \u201csupermajors\u201d such as Sonangol, Chevron, BP, Total, \n\netc. \n\n 'EUR Million 2012 2013 2014 2015F 2016F 2017F 2018F 2019F 2020F Perpetuity\n\nRevenues 25.600 29.959 28.655 23.914 25.051 28.656 30.138 31.133 33.429 34.622\n\n   % of Growth -0,7% 17,0% -4,4% -16,5% 4,8% 14,4% 5,2% 3,3% 7,4% 3,6%\n\nCost of Sales  (1.403)  (4.940)  (5.298)  (4.421)  (4.631)  (5.298)  (5.572)  (5.756)  (6.180)  (6.401)\n\n   % of Revenues -5,5% -16,5% -18,5% -18,5% -18,5% -18,5% -18,5% -18,5% -18,5% -18,5%\n\nGross Profit 24.198 25.020 23.357 19.493 20.419 23.358 24.566 25.377 27.248 28.221\n\n   Gross M argi n 94,5% 83,5% 81,5% 81,5% 81,5% 81,5% 81,5% 81,5% 81,5% 81,5%\n\nOperating Expenses  (20.221)  (17.315)  (15.565)  (12.990)  (13.608)  (15.566)  (16.371)  (16.912)  (18.159)  (18.807)\n\n% of Revenues -79,0% -57,8% -54,3% -54,3% -54,3% -54,3% -54,3% -54,3% -54,3% -54,3%\n\nGeneral Expenses  (272)  (1.675)  (1.837)  (1.533)  (1.606)  (1.837)  (1.932)  (1.996)  (2.143)  (2.219)\n\n% of Revenues -1,1% -5,6% -6,4% -6,4% -6,4% -6,4% -6,4% -6,4% -6,4% -6,4%\n\nPersonnel Expenses  (280)  (822)  (1.044)  (871)  (913)  (1.044)  (1.098)  (1.135)  (1.218)  (1.262)\n\n% of Revenues -1,09% -2,74% -3,64% -3,6% -3,6% -3,6% -3,6% -3,6% -3,6% -3,6%\n\nEBITDA 3.425 5.207 4.911 4.098 4.293 4.911 5.165 5.336 5.729 5.933\n\n   EBITDA M argi n 13,4% 17,4% 17,1% 17,1% 17,1% 17,1% 17,1% 17,1% 17,1% 17,1%\n\nAmortization  (557)  (1.399)  (2.144)  (1.790)  (1.875)  (2.145)  (2.255)  (2.330)  (2.502)  (2.591)\n\nEBIT 2.868 3.809 2.766 2.309 2.418 2.766 2.910 3.006 3.227 3.342\n\n   EBIT M argi n 11,2% 12,7% 9,7% 9,7% 9,7% 9,7% 9,7% 9,7% 9,7% 9,7%\n\nFinancial Results 266  (82)  (283)  (691)  (781)  (884)  (965)  (861)  (795)  (733)\n\nNon-Operating Results  (310)  (739)  (872)  (872)  (872)  (872)  (872)  (872)  (872)  (872)\n\nSubsidiary Results 140 192 206 206 206 206 206 206 206 206\n\nEBT 2.963 3.179 1.818 952 971 1.216 1.279 1.478 1.767 1.944\n\n   EBT M argi n 11,6% 10,6% 6,3% 4,0% 3,9% 4,2% 4,2% 4,7% 5,3% 5,6%\n\nTaxation  (1.253)  (936)  (679)  (286)  (291)  (365)  (384)  (444)  (530)  (583)\n\nTax Rate 42% 29% 37% -30,0% -30,0% -30,0% -30,0% -30,0% -30,0%\n\nNet Current Operating Activities 1.710 2.243 1.139 666 680 851 895 1.035 1.237 1.361\n\nExtraordinary 3.362 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nNet Income 5.072 2.244 1.140 667 681 852 896 1.036 1.238 1.362\n\n% of growth 109,0% -55,8% -49,2% -41,5% 2,1% 25,2% 5,1% 15,6% 19,5% 10,0%\n\nIncome M argi n 19,8% 7,5% 4,0% 2,8% 2,7% 3,0% 3,0% 3,3% 3,7% 3,9%\n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n \n\nThe integrated petroleum companies have a competitive advantage concerning; technical \n\nexpertise for exploration and extraction of oil and gas, financial advantage of cash flow to \n\noperations, and investment-grade credit rankings. Investment grade rankings are necessary \n\nfor financing debt. To conclude,, the integrated petroleum industry is highly capital intensive. \n\nBargaining Power of Suppliers: Medium \n\nSuppliers to vertically integrated industries include services from companies such as \n\nSchlumberger and Halliburton for technical hardware. Since there is a limited amount of \n\nsuppliers who provide technical equipment and the demand for technical supplies is high, \n\nmeans the suppliers wield some leverage regarding technical hardware and support. \n\nBargaining Power of Buyers: Low \n\nBuyers of oil and gas products range from individual users to large corporations and \n\ngovernments. With the demand of fuel products extremely high at a current global \n\nconsumption rate of 30 billion barrels of crude annually, and the price of fuel being driven by \n\nmarket factors oil industries have little control of demonstrates that customers have little \n\nbargaining power when it comes to the price of fuel. Until there is a proven fuel substitute, \n\ncustomers will continue to pay for the high cost of oil. In addition, as refining costs increase, \n\noil companies can to pass these rising costs on to consumers who demand it. \n\nThreat of Substitutes: Low \n\nAs of yet, there are very few substitutes for oil. Although technology is moving extremely \n\nfast in the area of renewable energy, no ready replacement for oil has been discovered as of \n\nyet. Bio-fuel is offering some competition to the traditional means of energy, however, bio-\n\nfuel, so far at the least is no real threat to the oil market or industry. Consequently, there is no \n\nimmediate threat of substitution. \n\nDegree of Rivalry: Medium \n\nThe vertically integrated oil and gas industry has many competitors which are spread out \n\ndomestically, and internationally implying a high degree of rivalry. The degree of rivalry is \n\nmedium and not high since most of the companies already have a specific market to sell to, \n\nand really do not have a definitive method to differentiate oil or brand name from competitors, \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n \n\nother than brand loyalty and price. Oil companies try to differentiate and market their oil with \n\nadditives, however, these benefits are difficult to quantify by the customer and thus render \n\nlittle advantage. Until peak oil is a major concern, the degree of rivalry will be medium. \n\nFive Forces Summary \n\nThe oil and gas industry is an attractive business opportunity. At this moment in time, and for \n\nthe next decade as the world demands energy via crude oil, the vertically integrated oil \n\ncompanies will be able to meet the demand. With the barriers to entry and substitution risk \n\nremaining high there is little room in the near future for the threat of competition or \n\nsubstitution. The vertically integrated oil companies are in the best position to profit in the \n\nfuture as oil becomes scarcer. In the future, as oil becomes in short supply, the integrated \n\ncompanies will be in the best position to profit. Furthermore, the integrated companies can \n\npurchase the assets of smaller distressed oil companies as they deplete their reserves, and \n\nstruggle to find new oil. As Sonangol E.P. business model is discussed, it will become clear \n\nthat Sonangol, is in a nice position to gain advantage in relation to their competition. \n\nAppendix 9 - Assumptions: Turnover Forecast \n\n?
