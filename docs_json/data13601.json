Adr. ex Juss.) Muell.-Arg. (fam-\nily Euphorbiaceae), which is perennial and has na economi-\ncally useful lifespan of \u201830-35 years. Adult trees shed their\nleaves almost completely for 3-4 weeks each year in a pro-\ncess known as wintering, subsequent to which they undergo\n\u201cflushing\u201d and produce new flowers, leaves and shoots.\nFlowering in Hevea normally occurs once a year after leaf\nfall and is directly affected by climatic factors, Hevea spe-\ncies having traditionally been cultivated in humid equato-\nrial regions subject to monsoons (Rao and Vijayakumar,\n1992) and characterized by adequate rainfall distribution\nand small yearly fluctulations in temperature and humidity\n(Rao et al., 1993). In some countries to achieve self-\n\nsufficiency, attempts have been made to extend Hevea cul-\ntivation to marginal areas with varied climatic constraints,\nsome areas being as far north as 29\u00b0 in India and China and\nsouth to 23\u00b0 in the Brazilian state of S\u00e3o Paulo\n(Pushparajah, 1983; Ortolani et al., 1998).\n\nRubber trees are grown for their latex from which is\ncollected by tapping, coagulated and processed to form rub-\nber, hence it is the dry rubber yield that determines the level\nof output. Girth is considered to be a measure of vigor and\nis also an economically important character because it de-\ntermines the age at which a Hevea clone can be commer-\ncially exploited by tapping and is, therefore, important in\nshortening the uneconomic immature period of the clone.\nHowever, there are several high yielding clones whose\ngirthing is depressed by tapping (Abraham, 1992) because\nthis procedure is controlled wounding and as such stresses\nthe tree and retards growth, especially if carried out when\nthe trees are budding.\n\nGenetics and Molecular Biology, 28, 4, 758-764 (2005)\nCopyright by the Brazilian Society of Genetics.

Wu (1998) has developed a\ntheoretical basis to study the effects of increased overall se-\nlection intesity and reduced field-testing but the most fre-\nquently cited advantage of early selection in tree breeding\nis shortened generation interval because this causes a re-\nduction in the length of the breeding cycle (Nanson, 1970;\nLambeth, 1980; McKeand, 1988; Adams et al., 1989; Ad-\nams and Atiken, 1992; Matheson et al., 1994). Shortening\nthe breeding cycle of a tree through early selection can pro-\nduce more genetic gains per unit time (year) if there is\nstrong genetic correlation between early and mature traits.\n\nRubber is a forest tree crop and takes more than 25\nyears to complete a breeding cycle because of which ge-\nnetic improvement of Hevea is normally a slow process,\neven for a single selection and breeding cycle. In Hevea\nbreding there is usually a lapse of 3 years from pollination\nto field planting and since rubber trees generally require\nseveral years (often 6 or more) to reach tapping girth there\nis a wait of 7-9 years until tapping is started and then a\n10-15 years period of tapping and clone evaluation.\n\nDetermining trends in age-age correlation is rela-\ntively simple for growth and yield traits, requiring only pa-\ntience and repeated assessment. While there have been\nmany reported age-age correlations for growth in conifers\n(e.g. Lambeth, 1980; McKeand, 1988; Riemenschneider,\n1988; King and Burdon, 1991; Matheson et al., 1994) there\nare few for Hevea species (Gon\u00e7alves et al, 1988.)\n\nThe objective of the research described in the present\npaper was to use age-age correlations and selection effi-\nciency estimates to study the potential of early selection of\nHevea for forward breeding using data from a series of as-\nsessments of a Hevea spp. clone trial carried out in the\nnorthwest of the Brazilian state of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nIn this study we used 55 Brazilian, 10 Malaysian and\nthree Indonesia genotypes (clones) from a small-scale\nclone trial belonging to the Campinas Agronomic Institute\n(Instituto Agron\u00f4mico de Campinas - IAC), Campinas, S\u00e3o\nPaulo state, Brazil) breeding program. The Brazilian clones\nwere developed by the IAC breeding program while the\nMalaysian genotypes consisted of seven Rubber Research\nInstitute of Malaysia (RRIM) clones and three clones be-\nlonging to the Prang Besar (PB) private rubber plantation.\nThe Indonesian genotypes (clones) came from Proefstation\nvoor Rubber (PR) in Sumatra. All the clones were budded\nonto established rootstock (Tjir 1 x Tjir 16) at the nursery.\nOne-year-old rootstock seedlings raised in nurseries were\nused to budgraft clonal materials in December 1990, suc-\ncessful budgrafts being transplanted into polyethylene bags\n\nand the plantlets established in the field after the first flush\nof leaves developed.\n\nThe clones were grown at the Votuporanga Experi-\nmental Station (20\u00b025\u2019 S, 49\u00b059\u2019 W, elevation 450 m) in the\nnortwest of the Brazilian state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Mean monthly\ntemperatures varied from 20 to 25\u00b0C and the average an-\nnual rainfall ranged from 1.087 mm to 1.537 mm and the\nwinter drought varied from four to six dry months with an\naverage water deficiency of 180 mm. The trial was laid out\nin a randomized complete block design with three repli-\ncates using six trees replications per plot and 7 x 3 m spac-\ning. Missing plants were replaced with spares during the\nfirst two years after planting to maintain plantation density\nbut were not scored. One row of the commercial clone\nRRIM 600, acquired from a commercial nursery, was\nplanted around the plot. Annual fertilization consisted of\n400 g of 10-10-10 NPK formula per plant (Bataglia and\nGon\u00e7alves, 2002).\n\nTwelve months after planting the diameter of the\nstems of the plantlets were measured 0.5 cm above ground\nlevel using a slide caliper and this measurement converted\nto girth assuming that the stem was cylindrical. Immature\ngirth (girth A) was measured at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 years and\nmature grith (girth B) at 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 years. At the end\nof the sixth year all the trees with a girth of 45 cm or more\nwere tapped for annual latex production 1.2 m above the\nhighest point of the bud union using a half-spiral four-day\ntapping system (seven tappings per month) for 11 months\nper year. Yield was recorded on the days when normal tap-\nping, which starts around 7:30 AM, was possible, the latex\nbeing collect in individual plastic cups for each tree and co-\nagulated by adding 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution, with stir-\nring, to the cup once the latex flow had stopped. The\ncoagulated rubber in each cup was made into a \u201cbiscuit\u201d\nwhich was dried for about 30 days by hanging it on a wire\ntied to the tree from which it had been extracted. After dry,\neach rubber biscuit was weighed and the dry rubber content\nfor each tree recorded. Attempts were made to record 12\ngirths measurements and six annual yields.\n\nA combined three-factor cross classification analysis\nof variance (ANOVAR) was performed on the data using\nthe statistical model:\n\nYijk = ? + gi + aj + bk + (ga)ij + (gb)ik + (ab)jk + (gab)ijk,\n\nwhere, Yijk = observed value of the ith genotype in the year\nin the kth replication; ? = general mean; gi = fixed effect of\nthe ith genotype (i = 1, 2,g, g = 68); aj = effects of the jth\nyear (j = 1, 2,s, s = 6); bk = effect of the kth randomized\nblock (k = 1, 2,b, b = 3); (ga)ij = interaction between ith ge-\nnotype with the jth year; (gb) ik = interaction between ith ge-\nnotype with the kth replication; (gab)ijk = interaction\nbetween genotype, year and replication. It the assumed that\nthe interactions (ab)ij and (gb)ik were not significant, these\nbeing included in the residual together with (gab)ijk.\n\nGon\u00e7alves et al. 759\n\n\n\nData from more than three traits were used for com-\nputation of genotypic age-age correlation using the Selegen\nsoftware (Resende and Oliveira, 1997). Values of\ngenotypic correlation were computed among all traits and\nage combinations. Genotypic correlations were worked out\naccording to Kempthorne (1966) as follows:\n\nr\nCOVg\n\ng xy\n\nxy\n\ngx gy\n\n( )\n\n( )\n?\n\n?? ?\n2 2\n\n,\n\nwhere COVg(xy) = the genotypic covariance for traits x and\ny; ?\n\ngx\n\n2 = genotypic variance for trait x; ?\ngy\n\n2 = genotypic vari-\nance for trait y.\n\nFor each trait, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coeffi-\ncient (rs) was computed between age 6 and younger ages.\nRank 1 was assigned to the lowest value and rank 68 to the\nhighest value within each age for a given trait. The signifi-\ncance of these correlations was tested using the Table XXV\nof Fisher (1941), for genotypic correlations for 5 and 1%\nprobability. The genotypic correlations were tested at the\ndegrees of freedom of the error. Percent success in correctly\nselecting the best 5, 10, 15 or 30 clones at age 2 and above\nwas calculated using the ranks of clones method. Scatter\nplots between ranks at age 6 and at younger ages were plot-\nted for each trait. Scatter plots of ranks for girth between\nage 2 and 3, age 3 and 4, and age 4 and 5 were also pro-\nduced, showing the identification numbers of respective\nclones against the plotted points.\n\nResults\n\nAll effects including the genotype versus years inter-\naction were highly significant (p &lt;0.01) statistically in the\noverall analysis of variance for girth A, girth B and yield\n(Table 1).\n\nSignificant positive genotypic correlation coeffi-\ncients (rg) were observed for all the combinations of traits\nand ages (Table 2). The rg values were higher for traits of\nthe same age group and as the difference increased rg usu-\nally decreased. The rg values within a trait varied from\n0.3916 to 0.9916 for girth A, 0.5116 to 0.9517 for girth B\n\nand 0.3916 to 0.9612 for yield. The rg values between girth\nA and girth B were high, althoygh both girth values showed\nlow rg values in relation to yield.\n\nSimilarly, significant of rank correlation coefficient\n(rs) values were observed between age 6 and younger ages\nfor girth A, girth B and yield (Table 3). The values of rs with\nreference to age 6 ranged from 0.5498 (for age 1) to 0.9420\n(for age 5) for girth A, from 0.5114 (for age 1) to 0.9471\n(for age 5) for girth B, and from 0.3451 (for age 1) to 0.8311\n(for age 5) for yield. Since rs was significant for all age\ncombinations, it shows that there were no drastic changes in\nthe ranks of the different clones between age 1 and 6.\n\nTable 4 shows that selecting the best 30 clones at age 2\nwould lead to the best 69.93% of clones on a girth A basis (or\n76.59% on a girth B or yield basis) being correctly selected at\nage 6 and the proportion increased to between 83.25% and\n89.91% if selection was made at age 3 and 89.91% to\n96.57% at age 4. The success in correctly selecting the set of\nthe best 15 clones at age 6 by selection at age 3 was 66.70%\non a girth A basis and 80.04% on a girth B or yield basis, the\nsuccess being much lower when the trees were selected at\nless than 3 years of age. The success in correct selection of\nthe set of the best 5 clones at age 4 was 80% on a girth A or\ngirth B basis and only 60% on a yield basis.\n\nFigure 1 shows the scatter plot of ranks of clone\nmeans for girth A by plotting the ranks at age 6 along\nX-axis and ranks at younger ages along the Y-axis. With an\nincrease in age along the Y-axis, the plotted points tend to\nconverge along the imaginary diagonal drawn from the ori-\ngin. If the ranks on the X and Y-axes belong to the same\nage, the plotted points would be axiomatically be on the di-\nagonal. As the difference in age in the two axes increased,\nthe values of X and Y fall more and more out of step, result-\ning in increased scattering of the points and lower rs values.\n\nOf the best 34 girth A clones (ranking from 35 to 68) at\nage 6, 24 were also among the best 34 clones at age 2 while\n27 clones were among the best 36 clones at this age. By se-\nlecting the best 34 girth A clones at age two we could select\n76.7% of the best 34 clones at age 6 and this success rate\ncould be increased to 90% if 38 age 2 clones were used. Sim-\nilarly, by selecting the best 15 girth A clones at age 3 we\n\n760 Age-age correlation in Hevea\n\nTable 1 - Analysis of variance for immature girth ages (girth A), girth mature ages (girth B) and rubber production (yield) for 68 Hevea genotypes\n(clones) grown in Votuporanga, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil.\n\nSources of variation d.f.

Selecting the best 5 girth A clones at age 4\nmeant that 60% of the set of the best 5 clones could be se-\nlected at age 6 and this could be increased to 100% if 8 clones\nwere selected at age 4 (Figure 1). The scatter plots of girth B\nand yield (not shown) also showed a similar trend. Selection\nof the set of the 3 most productive clones at age 6 could be\nmade with accuracy at age 5, although the ranks of the three\nclones changed among themselves during the sixth year.\n\nOf the best 20 clones at age 3, the number of clones\nthat simultaneously existed in the set of the best 36 clones at\nage 2 was 20 on a girth A basis [Figure 2(i)] and 19 each on\na girth B or yield basis. The best 8 clones at age 4 invariably\nappeared in the set of the best 20 clones at age 3 for girth A\n(Figure 2 (ii)), girth B or yield. Each of the best 5 clones at\nages 5 and 6 were among the best 8 clones at age 4 for girth\nA (Figure 2 (iii)), or girth B, while only 4 clones out of 5\ntop-ranking clones at age 6 could do so in respect of yield.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe presence of significant clone versus site interac-\ntion indicates that genotypes perform differently between\nyears for girth A, girth B and yield.\n\nExistence of a strong, positive genotypic correlation\n(Table 2) as well as rank correlation (Table 3) between girth\nA, girth B and yield suggests that selection of clones for su-\nperiority in respect of one of these traits would inevitably\nlead to selection of superior clones in respect to the other\ntwo traits as well. However, any decision on the selection of\nclones should preferably be taken on the basis of the girth A\ntrait because vigor, represented by girth volume, is more\nclosely related with girth A than with girth B or yield only.\nWe also suggest that for early evaluations girth A should be\nused in preference to secondary characters such as height,\nnumber of laticiferous vessel rings, etc.\n\nIt was not possible to predict with any fair degree of\nsuccess as to which clone would occupy a particular rank at\n\nGon\u00e7alves et al. 761\n\nFigure 1 - Scatter plot ranks recorded at age six ranks at age 1 (i), 2 (ii), 3 (iii), 4 (iviv) and 5 (v) for mean girth A values of 68 clones.

At younger ages, a realistic\nattempt can be made to determine only the set of the best n\nclones (n > 1) at panel opening age, without allocating the n\nranks of panel opening age to individual clones. Therefore,\nexchange of ranks between clones within the selected set of\nclones was not viewed as a waste of selection effort during\nthis study.\n\nGottardi et al., (1995) reported that the ranking in\ngirth A among 11 Hevea clones did not vary much after 3\nyears up to 7 years of age. The mean data for each clone\nshowed good genotypic correlation for girth between age 7\nand young ages. The coefficient increased with increasing\nage suggesting that early selection was possible.

clones could be done on a girth basis after 24\nmonths.\n\nOur study shows that in S\u00e3o Paulo it may be unwise to\nselect Hevea clones at age 1, although the 2 to 4-year\ngrowth data can be used differentially in the selection pro-\ncess. Selection of the sets of the best 30, 15, 10 and 5 clones\nfrom the available 68 clones at a given age was generally\naccompanied by a descending order of percentage success\n(Table 4). Thus, for a given level of percentage success in\nselection, the set of clones to be selected at a relatively\nyoung age needs to be large, while selection of a small set\nneeds a higher selection age. Therefore, it is suggested that:\na) to have the best 30 (i.e. 44% of the available germplasm)\nclones at age 6 select the set of the best 36 (53%) clones at\nage 2; b) to have the best 15 (22%) clones at age 6 select the\nset of the best 20 (29.41%) clones at age 3; c) to have the\nbest 5 (7.35%) clones at age 6 select the set of the best 8\n(11.76%) clones at age 4; and d) to have the best 3 (4.4%)\nclones at age 6 just select the set of the best 3 (4.41%)\nclones at age 5. More than 80% of the clones targeted on a\ngirth A or yield basis, and more than 76,7% clones targeted\non a girth B basis, were found to be correctly identified dur-\ning steps (a) to (d). Nevertheles, the 5 highest-ranking age 6\nclones (viz. clones with identification numbers 68, 67, 66,\n65 and 64) on a girth A (Figure 1 and 2) or girth B basis\nwere found to be invariably present in the sets of clones se-\nlected at (a), (b) and (c).\n\nOne is often faced with the task of making early selec-\ntion of clones on the basis of a field test to give interim rec-\nommendation about the choice of clone for further\nmulti-location testing (large-scale trials). The age of early\nselection needs to be sufficently long to effect a reasonable\nlevel of selection accuracy. After making early selection,\nvegetative multiplication of the selected clones is started\nand it is continued for many years in order to build the\nbudwood stock nursery which is large enough to supply\nbuds to all rubber producers on a sustained basis. To\nshorten the time involved in this two-stage process of (i) se-\nlecting the most promissing clones, followed by (ii) multi-\nplying their germplasm, an alternative approach involving\nconcurrent short-listing and multiplication of clones is sug-\ngested. According to this approach, early selection of the\nbest 60% of clones should be done at age 2 of the field trial\n\nGon\u00e7alves et al. 763\n\nTable 3 - Values of Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (rs) between\nage 6 and younger ages for immature girth age (girth (A), mature girth age\n(girth B) and rubber production (yield) for 25 Hevea genotypes (clones)\ngrown in Votuporanga, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil.\n\nTrait Age combination (years)\n\n1 and 6 2 and 6 3 and 6 4 and 6 5 and 6\n\nGirth A 0.5498 0.6773 0.7723 0.8005 0.9420\n\nGirth B 0.5114 0.5685 0.8320 0.9046 0.9471\n\nYield 0.3451 0.5988 0.5185 0.6556 0.8311\n\nAll values in table are significant at p &lt;0.01.\n\nTable 4 - Extent of success in correctly selecting a set of 5, 10, 15 or 30\nbest clones for age 6 (girth) and age 6 (yield) by making selection at age 2,\n3, 4, 5 or 6 respectively.\n\nTr Sa Ct Cs Pe\n\nYears N % N % %\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)1 (e) (f)2 (g)3\n\nGirth A 2 5 7.35 3 4.41 60.00\n\nGirth A 3 5 7.35 4 5.88 80.00\n\nGirth A 4 5 7.35 4 5.88 80.00\n\nGirth A 5 5 7.35 4 5.88 80.00\n\nGirth A 2 10 14.70 5 7.35 50.00\n\nGirth A 3 10 14.70 8 11.76 80.00\n\nGirth A 4 10 14.70 8 11.76 80.00\n\nGirth A 5 10 14.70 10 14.70 80.00\n\nGirth A 2 15 22.06 7 10.29 46.67\n\nGirth A 3 15 22.06 10 14.70 66.70\n\nGirth A 4 15 22.06 12 17.64 80.04\n\nGirth A 5 15 22.06 12 17.64 80.04\n\nGirth A 2 30 44.12 21 30.87 69.93\n\nGirth A 3 30 44.12 25 36.75 83.25\n\nGirth A 4 30 44.12 27 39.69 89.91\n\nGirth A 5 30 44.12 28 41.16 93.24\n\nGirth B 2 5 7.35 3 4.41 60.00\n\nGirth B 3 5 7.35 3 4.41 60.00\n\nGirth B 4 5 7.35 4 5.88 80.00\n\nGirth B 5 5 7.35 4 5.88 80.00\n\nGirth B 2 10 14.70 7 10.29 70.00\n\nGirth B 3 10 14.70 6 8.82 60.00\n\nGirth B 4 10 14.70 7 10.29 70.00\n\nGirth B 5 10 14.70 9 13.23 90.00\n\nGirth B 2 15 22.06 10 14.70 66.70\n\nGirth B 3 15 22.06 12 17.64 80.04\n\nGirth B 4 15 22.06 12 17.64 80.04\n\nGirth B 5 15 22.06 13 19.11 86.71\n\nGirth B 2 30 44.12 23 33.81 76.59\n\nGirth B 3 30 44.12 25 36.75 83.25\n\nGirth B 4 30 44.12 29 42.63 96.57\n\nGirth B 5 30 44.12 30 44.10 100.00\n\nYield 2 5 7.35 3 4.41 60.00\n\nYield 3 5 7.35 2 2.94 40.00\n\nYield 4 5 7.35 3 4.41 60.00\n\nYield 5 5 7.35 4 5.88 80.00\n\nYield 2 10 14.70 5 7.35 50.00\n\nYield 3 10 14.70 8 11.76 80.00\n\nYield 4 10 14.70 8 11.76 80.00\n\nYield 5 10 14.70 10 14.70 100.00\n\nYield 2 15 22.06 7 10.29 66.70\n\nYield 3 15 22.06 12 17.64 80.04\n\nYield 4 15 22.06 12 17.64 80.04\n\nYield 5 15 22.06 14 20.58 96.38\n\nYield 2 30 44.12 23 33.81 76.59\n\nYield 3 30 44.12 27 39.69 89.91\n\nYield 4 30 44.12 27 39.69 89.91\n\nYield 5 30 44.12 28 41.16 93.33\n1(d) = (c) x 100/68; 2(f) = (e) x 100/68 and 3(g) = (e) x 100/(c).\nTr: Trait for selection of clones.

Short-listing of the best 33% (of the\noriginal number of clones under test) clones should be done\nfrom within the above set of clones select at age 3 on the ba-\nsis of (a) age 3 growth data in field trial and (b) grafting and\nsurvival performance of buds during the previous year in\nnursery. Propagation of the rejected clones should be\nstopped by uprooting and eliminating the rejected clones\n(roguing). This process of the simultaneous roguing of\nclones on the basis of current evaluation and the vegetative\npropagation of select clones can be continued in the subse-\nquent years until the desired selection intensity and number\nof clones (ramets) are archieved, the best 5% of clones be-\ning shot-listed at age 5.\n\nEarly selection might result in some bias against\nclones which grow relatively slow in the initial stage but\ncatch up with others at the later stages. However, Figure 1\nand Table 2 suggest that such clones would be very few,\nand , in fact, such clones would lag behind others if planted\nin intimate mixture with other clones at high densities.\nSince the objective of a Hevea improvement program is to\nmaximize gains per unit time it is undesirable to delay mak-\ning interim recommendation about choice of clones and\nstarting their vegetative multiplication on the basis of early\nevaluation just because sporadic clones would be\ndisfavored. Final recommendation on the choice of clones\nfor later deployment in plantations and for serving as par-\nents for the next generation of Hevea improvement can be\ndone at year 4 because in S\u00e3o Paulo Hevea normally does\nnot flower before this age.\n\nConclusions\n\nEarly selection of Hevea clones for tapping panel\nopening at age of 6 years can be done effectively at age 4.\nSelection at age 2 is relatively less accurate but it results in\nearly propagation of selected clones for further testing or\ndeployment. To combine the advantages of these two early\nselection ages we suggest a differential selection strategy,\ni.e. the best 60% of clones of the original set should be se-\nlected at age 2,33% at age 3, 13% at age 4 and 5% at age 5.\nThe sets of clones to be selected at age 3 and later should be\ncontained in the sets selected in the perceding years. Multi-\nplication of the selected clones should be started at the end\nof the second year of the field trial and continued in succes-\nsive years. Selection at age 2 should be done on the basis of\ngrowth, preferably vigor (girth A) in the field trial.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo a Pesquisa\ndo Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP), for supporting this re-\nsearch.
